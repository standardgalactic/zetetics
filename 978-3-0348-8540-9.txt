Preface 
The discoveries of the past decade have opened new perspectives for the old field of 
Hamiltonian systems and led to the creation of a new field: symplectic topology. 
Surprising rigidity phenomena demonstrate that the nature of symplectic map-
pings is very different from that of volume preserving mappings which raised new 
questions, many of them still unanswered. On the other hand, due to the analysis 
of an old variational principle in classical mechanics, global periodic phenomena in 
Hamiltonian systems have been established. As it turns out, these seemingly differ-
ent phenomena are mysteriously related. One of the links is a class of symplectic 
invariants, called symplectic capacities. These invariants are the main theme of 
this book which grew out of lectures given by the authors at Rutgers University, 
the RUB Bochum and at the ETH Zurich (1991) and also at the Borel Seminar in 
Bern 1992. Since the lectures did not require any previous knowledge, only a few 
and rather elementary topics were selected and proved in detail. Moreover, our se-
lection has been prompted by a single principle: the action principle of mechanics. 
The action functional for loops in the phase space, given by 
1 
Fh) = J 
pdq - J H(t, 'Y(t)) dt , 
'Y 
0 
differs from the old Hamiltonian principle in the configuration space defined by a 
Lagrangian. The critical points of F are those loops 'Y which solve the Hamiltonian 
equations associated with the Hamiltonian H and hence are the periodic orbits. 
This variational principle is sometimes called the least action principle. However, 
there is no minimum for F. Indeed, the action principle is very degenerate. All 
its critical points are saddle points of infinite Morse index, and at first sight, the 
principle appears quite useless for existence proofs. But surprisingly it is very effec-
tive. This will be demonstrated using several variational techniques starting from 
minimax arguments due to P. Rabinowitz and ending with A. Floer's homology. 
The book includes the following subjects: 
The introductory chapter presents in a rather unsystematic way some back-
ground material. We give the definitions of symplectic manifolds and symplectic 
mappings and briefly recall the Hamiltonian formalism. For convenience, Cartan's 
calculus is used. The classification of 2-dimensional symplectic manifolds by the 
Euler-characteristic and the total volume is proved. Some questions dealt with 
later on in detail are raised and discussed in special examples. We illustrate the 
so-called direct method of the calculus of variations in order to establish a periodic 
orbit on a convex energy surface of a Hamiltonian system in ]R.2n. The Birkhoff 
invariants are introduced in order to describe without proofs the intricate orbit

PREFACE 
structure of a Hamiltonian system near an equilibrium point or near a periodic 
solution. These local results are quite in contrast to the global questions dealt with 
in the following chapters. 
In a systematic way the symplectic invariants, called symplectic capacities, are 
introduced axiomatically in Chapter 2. Considering the family of all symplectic 
manifolds of fixed dimension 2n, a capacity C is a map associating with every sym-
plectic manifold (M, w) a positive number c( M, w) or 00 satisfying these axioms: 
a monotonicity axiom for symplectic embeddings, a con formality axiom for the 
symplectic structure, and a normalization axiom which rules out the volume in 
higher dimensions. For subsets of ffi.2n , the capacity extends a familiar linear sym-
plectic invariant for positive quadratic forms to nonlinear symplectic mappings. 
If M and N are symplectic ally diffeomorphic then c( M, w) = c( N, T). In view of 
its monotonicity property a capacity represents, in particular, an obstruction to 
certain symplectic embeddings and it will be used in order to explain rigidity phe-
nomena for symplectic embeddings, discovered by Ya. Eliashberg and M. Gromov. 
In particular, Gromov's squeezing theorem is deduced using capacities as well as 
Eliashberg's CO-stability of symplectic diffeomorphisms. We introduce a notion 
of a symplectic homeomorphism, a concept which raises many questions. There 
are many different capacity functions. For example, the size of the largest ball 
in ffi.2n which can be symplectically embedded into a symplectic manifold (M, w) 
leads to a special capacity called the Gromov width. It is the smallest capacity 
function originally introduced by M. Gromov. There are many other "embedding" 
capacities. 
Chapter 3 is devoted entirely to a very detailed construction of a distinguished 
symplectic capacity co. It is dynamically defined by means of Hamiltonian systems. 
It measures the minimal CO-oscillation of a Hamiltonian function H : M -+ ffi. 
which allows to conclude the existence of a fast periodic solution of the corre-
sponding Hamiltonian vector field X H on M. In the special case of a connected 
2-dimensional symplectic manifold, the capacity Co agrees with the total area. The 
existence proof is based on the above action principle which is introduced from 
scratch in its proper functional analytic framework. The interesting aspect of this 
principle is that it is bounded neither from below nor from above so that stan-
dard variational techniques do not apply directly. Techniques going back to P. 
Rabinowitz permit us to establish effectively distinguished saddle points of the 
functional representing special periodic solutions of the system. In the special case 
of a convex, bounded and smooth domain U C ffi.2n , the capacity is represented by 
a distinguished closed characteristic of its boundary aU: it has minimal reduced 
action equal to co(U). But, in general, it is rather difficult to compute the invariant 
Co. Some of the recent computations based on more advanced techniques of first 
order elliptic systems and Fredholm theory are presented without proofs. With the 
construction of the capacity Co, the proofs of the rigidity phenomena described in 
Chapter 2 are complete. Due to its special properties this invariant turns out to 
be useful also for the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. 

PREFACE 
Xl 
In Chapter 4 the dynamical capacity Co is applied to an old question of the 
qualitative theory of Hamiltonian systems originating in celestial mechanics: does 
a compact energy surface carry a periodic orbit? We shall demonstrate that many 
well-known global existence results previously obtained by technically intricate 
proofs emerge immediately from this invariant. The phenomenon is simply this: 
if a compact hypersurface in a symplectic manifold possesses a neighborhood of 
finite capacity Co, then there are always uncountably many closed characteristics 
nearby. If one poses, in addition, symplectic ally invariant restrictions, such as of 
"contact type", then the hypersurface itself carries a closed characteristic. We 
shall prove, in particular, the seminal solution of the Weinstein conjecture in ]R2n 
due to C. Viterbo. A nonstandard symplectic torus shows that, in contrast to 
the Gromov width mentioned above, not every compact symplectic manifold is 
of finite capacity Co. Our special example is related to M. Herman's celebrated 
counterexample to the closing lemma which answers a longstanding open question 
in dynamical systems. M. Herman's "non-closing-Iemma" is proved at the end of 
the chapter. 
In Chapter 5 we study the subgroup 1) of symplectic diffeomorphisms of ]R2n 
which are generated by time dependent Hamiltonian vector fields of compact sup-
port. The distance from the identity map or the energy E ( 'P) of such a symplectic 
diffeomorphism 'P will be measured by means of the oscillation of its generating 
Hamiltonian function. This will lead to a surprising bi-invariant metric on 1) called 
the Hofer metric and defined by d('P,'lj;) = E('P- 1 0 'lj;). The definition does not 
involve derivatives of the Hamiltonian and is of CO-nature. The verification of the 
metric property requiring that d( 'P, 'lj;) = 0 if and only if'P = 'lj; is the difficult as-
pect. It is based on more refined minimax arguments for the action functional valid 
simultaneously for a large class of Hamiltonians. We shall investigate the relations 
of this distinguished metric to the dynamical symplectic invariant Co introduced 
in Chapter 3 and also to another symplectic invariant which is defined for subsets 
of ]R2n and called the displacement energy. The displacement energy of a subset 
U measures the minimal energy E ( 'P) needed in order to dislocate a given set U 
from itself in the sense that un 'P(U) = 0. The bi-invariant metric will also be 
compared with the standard sup-metric. Geodesic arcs associated with the metric 
will be defined and described in detail. A special example of a geodesic arc is the 
flow generated by an autonomous Hamiltonian. An important role in our approach 
is played by the action spectrum of a Hamiltonian mapping 'P E 1), which turns 
out to be a nowhere dense subset of the real numbers. Our minimax principle 
singles out a nontrivial continuous section of the action spectrum bundle over 1) 
called the ,-invariant. This invariant is the main technical tool in this chapter. It 
allows the characterization of the geodesics and is used also in the existence proof 
of infinitely many nontrivial periodic points for compactly supported Hamiltonian 
mappings. 
The subject of Chapter 6 is the fixed point theory for Hamiltonian mappings 
on compact symplectic manifolds (M, w). It differs from topological fixed point

theories. A Hamiltonian map is a special symplectic map: it is homotopic to the 
identity and the homotopy is generated by the flow of a time dependent Hamilto-
nian vector field. Prompted by H. Poincare's last geometric theorem, V.l. Arnold 
conjectured in the sixties that such a Hamiltonian map possesses at least as many 
fixed points as a real-valued function on M possesses critical points. Reformulated 
in terms of dynamical systems, the conjecture asks for a Ljusternik-Schnirelman 
theory respectively for a Morse theory of forced oscillations solving a time periodic 
Hamiltonian system on M. We shall first prove the conjecture for the special case 
of the standard torus T2n. The proof is again based on the action principle. But 
this time the aim is to find all its critical points. Our strategy is inspired by C. 
Conley's topological approach to dynamical systems: we shall study the topology 
of the set of all bounded solutions of the regularized gradient equation belonging 
to the action functional defined on the set of contractible loops on the manifold M. 
This way the study of the gradient flow in the infinite dimensional loop space is 
reduced to the study of a gradient like continuous flow of a compact metric space, 
whose rest points are the desired critical points. Their number is then estimated 
by Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory presented in 6.3. A reinterpretation will then 
lead us to the proof of the Arnold conjecture for the larger class of symplectic 
manifolds satisfying [wll1f2(M) = o. In this general case there is no natural regu-
larization and we are forced to investigate in 6.4 the set of bounded solutions of 
the non regularized gradient system which now are smooth solutions of a special 
system of first order elliptic partial differential equations of Cauchy Riemann type. 
These solutions are related to M. Gromov's pseudoholomorphic curves in M. The 
compactness of the solution set will be base~ on an analytical technique which is 
sometimes called bubbling off analysis. Following this procedure, we shall arrive 
at the high point of these developments: A. Floer's new approach to Morse theory 
and Floer homology. We shall merely outline Floer's beautiful ideas in 6.5. A com-
bination of Floer's approach with the construction of the dynamical capacity Co 
results in a symplectic homology theory which is not yet in its final form and which 
will be sketched without proofs in the last section. The technical requirements of 
these theories are quite advanced and beyond the scope of this book. Floer's ideas 
and further related developments will be presented in detail in a sequel. Chapter 6 
illustrates, in particular, that old problems emerging from celestial mechanics still 
lead to powerful new techniques useful also in other branches of mathematics. We 
should point out that the Arnold conjecture for a general symplectic manifold is 
still open in the dimensions ~ 8. 
The Appendix contains some technical topics presented for the convenience of 
the reader. In A.1 we show that a symplectic diffeomorphism can be locally rep-
resented in terms of a single function, the so-called generating function. This clas-
sical fact is used in Chapter 5. Appendix A.2 illustrates the generating functions 
in the construction of action-angle coordinates for integrable systems occurring in 
Chapter 4. A special Sobolev embedding theorem required in the analysis of the 
action functional (Chapter 5) is proved in A.3. We derive some basic estimates

for the Cauchy-Riemann operator on the sphere (AA), elliptic estimates near the 
boundary (A.5) and prove the generalized Carleman similarity principle (A.6); all 
these results for special partial differential equations are important in Chapter 6. 
While the analytical tools required in the first five chapters are introduced in de-
tail, we make use of topological tools without explanations: we use the Brouwer 
mapping degree (Chapter 2), the Leray-Schauder degree (Chapter 3), the Smale 
degree (mod2) and (co-) homology theories (Chapter 6). References concerning 
these topological topics are given in A.7 and A.8 where we explain the Brouwer 
degree and the continuity property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology. This 
continuity property is important to us for the proof of the Arnold conjecture in 
the general case.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
We shall introduce the concepts of symplectic manifolds, symplectic mappings and 
Hamiltonian vector fields. It is not the intention to give a systematic treatment of 
the Hamiltonian formalism, because it is already presented in many books. Rather 
we shall ask some questions related to these concepts which recently lead to new 
phenomena and interesting open problems. The question: "What can be done with 
a symplectic mapping?" leads, for example, to new symplectic invariants different 
from the volume and discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. We shall illustrate 
that a seemingly very different and old problem originating in celestial mechan-
ics is related to these invariants. Namely, prompted by the Poincare recurrence 
theorem, we ask whether a compact energy surface of a Hamiltonian vector field 
possesses a periodic orbit. For the very special case of a convex hypersurface in 
~2n, historically one of the landmarks in this qualitative problem of Hamiltonian 
systems, we shall give an existence proof in order to illustrate the so-called direct 
method of the calculus of variation. This classical method is in contrast to the more 
recent methods introduced in the following chapters in order to establish global 
periodic solutions. At the end of the introduction we shall illustrate without proofs 
the rich and intricate orbit structure to be expected near a given periodic orbit. 
The considerations are based on the local, nonlinear Birkhoff-invariants presented 
in detail. 
1.1 
Symplectic vector spaces 
Definition. A symplectic vector space (V, w) is a finite dimensional real vector 
space V equipped with a distinguished bilinear form w which is antisymmetric 
and nondegenerate, i.e., 
(1.1) 
w(u,V) = -w(v,u) , u,V E V 
and, for every u"# 0 E V, there is a v E V satisfying w(u,v) "# O. This nondegen-
eracy is equivalent to the requirement that the map 
(1.2) 
V---+V*, 
Vf-+w(v,·) 
is a linear isomorphism of V onto its dual vector space V*. An example is the 
so-called standard symplectic vector space (~2n, wo) with 
(1.3) 
wo(u,V) = (Ju,v) 
for all U,V E ~2n,

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
where the bracket denotes the Euclidean inner product in ]R2n, and where the 
2n x 2n matrix J is defined by 
(1.4) 
J 
(-~ ~) 
with respect to the splitting ]R2n = ]Rn x ]Rn. Clearly det J f=. 0 and since JT = -J 
the form Wo is nondegenerate and antisymmetric. We note that 
(1.5) 
In particular J2 = -1 and 
wo(u,Jv) = (u,v). 
Therefore, J is a complex structure on ]R2n compatible with the Euclidean inner 
product. Recall that a complex structure on a real vector space V is a linear 
transformation J : V -t V satisfying J2 = -1. It makes V into an n-dimensional 
complex vector space by defining 
(a + i(3)v = av + {3Jv 
for a,{3 E]R and v E V. In the example (]R2n,wo) we may identify ]R2n with en in 
the usual way by mapping z = (x, y) E ]Rn x ]Rn onto x + iy E en. The linear map 
J corresponds to the multiplication by -i in en. 
In the following we shall call v orthogonal to u and write v ..1. u if w(v,u) = O. 
If E is a linear subspace of V, we define its orthogonal complement by 
(1.6) 
EJ. = {uEVlw(v,u)=O forall VEE}. 
EJ. is a linear subspace and in view of the nondegeneracy of the bilinear form w, 
we have 
(1.7) 
dim E + dim EJ. = dim V. 
Indeed, choosing a basis el, ... , ed in E, the subspace EJ. is the kernel of the 
linearly independent functionals w( ej, .) on V such that dim EJ. = dim V - dim E 
as claimed. Since u l. v is equivalent to v l. u we see that 
(1.8) 
The concept of orthogonality in symplectic geometry differs sharply from that 
in Euclidean geometry: E and EJ. need not be complementary subspaces. For 
example, every vector v E V is orthogonal to itself since w(v, v) = -w(v, v). Hence 
if dimE = 1 we have E C EJ.. 

1.1 SYMPLECTIC VECTOR SPACES

We can, of course, restrict the bilinear form w to a linear subspace E c V. 
This restricted form will obviously be antisymmetric but, in general, fails to be 
nondegenerate. It is nondegenerate on E if and only if 
(1.9) 
EnE.L = {a}, 
which follows immediately from the definitions. In view of (1.7) the statement (1.9) 
holds precisely if E and E.L are complementary, i.e., 
We see that (E, w) is a symplectic vector space if (1.9) is satisfied and we call E 
a symplectic subspace. Because of the symmetry of (1.9) in E and E.L, we conclude 
that E is symplectic if and only if E.L is symplectic. 
The following proposition shows that every symplectic space looks like the 
standard space (1I~2n, wo). 
Proposition 1. The dimension of a symplectic vector space (V, w) is even. If dim V = 
2n there exists a basis e1, ... , en, h, ... , In of V satisfying, for i, j = 1,2, ... n, 
w(ei' ej) 
a 
w(fi' fJ) 
a 
w(fi, ej) 
{ 
1 if i=j 
a if i=l=j 
Such a basis is called a symplectic (or canonical) basis of V. Representing 
U, v E V in this basis by 
n 
(Xj ej + xn+j Ij) 
U 
L 
j=1 
n 
(Yj ej + Yn+j Ij) 
v 
L 
j=1 
one computes readily that 
w(U,v) = (Jx,y) , 
X,Y E ~2n , 
where the matrix J is defined by (1.4). The subspaces Vj = span {ej, Ij} are 
symplectic and orthogonal to each other if i =1= j, so that the vector space V is the 
orthogonal sum

of 2-dimensional symplectic subspaces. With respect to this splitting the bilinear 
form w is, in symplectic coordinates, represented by the matrix 
(-~ ~) 
(-~ ~) 
(-~ ~) 
Proof of Proposition 1. Choose any vector el i=- 0 in V. Since w is nondegenerate 
we find u E V satisfying w( u, el) i=- 0, and we can normalize h = au such that 
Consequently, hand el are linearly independent since w is antisymmetric so that 
E = span {ell h} is a 2-dimensional symplectic subspace of V. If dim V = 2 the 
proof is finished. If dim V > 2 we apply the same argument to the complementary 
symplectic subspace EJ.. of V and thus find the desired basis in finitely many 
steps .• 
We see that for fixed dimension every symplectic vector space (V, w) can be 
put into the same normal form, quite in contrast to the situation of nondegenerate 
symmetric bilinear forms. The symplectic form w singles out those linear maps of 
v which leave the form invariant. 
Definition. A linear map A : V -+ V of a symplectic vector space (V, w) is called 
symplectic (or canonical) if 
A*w = w. 
By definition, A*w is the so-called pullback 2-form given by A*w(u,v) =w(Au,Av). 
In the standard space (]R2n, wo) a matrix A is, therefore, symplectic if and only if 
(JAu,Av) = (Ju, v) for all u,v E ]R2n, or equivalently, 
(1.11) 
AT J A = J. 
In the special case ]R2 of two dimensions this is equivalent to the condition that 
detA = 1. In general we conclude from (1.11) immediately that (detA)2 = 1. It 
turns out that 
(1.12) 
detA = 1, 
so that symplectic matrices in ]R2n are volume-preserving. This requires a proof 
and it is convenient to use the language of differential forms. Recall that, with the 

1.1 SYMPLECTIC VECTOR SPACES 
5 
coordinates Z = (ZI, ... , Z2n) E ]R2n, the bilinear form dZi 1\ dZj on ]R2n is defined 
by 
(dzi 1\ dzj)(u, v) = UiVj - UjVi, 
for U,V E ]R2n. Introducing the notation Z = (x,y) E ]R2n, we can, therefore, 
represent Wo in the form 
Then the 2n-form 
n 
Wo 
2:= dYj 1\ dXj. 
j=1 
o = Wo 1\ Wo 1\ ... 1\ Wo (n times ) 
on ]R2n is the volume form 
o = CdXl 1\ ... 1\ dXn 1\ dYl 1\ ... 1\ dYn 
with a constant c #- O. If A is a matrix in ]R2n then A*O = (detA)O by the 
definition of a determinant. Assuming that A*wo = Wo we conclude A*O = 0 and, 
hence, det A = 1 as claimed. 
The set of symplectic matrices in ]R2n, which meet the conditions (1.11), is 
a group under matrix multiplication. It is one of the classical Lie groups and is 
denoted by Sp(n). 
Proposition 2. If A and B E Sp(n) then A-I, AB E Sp(n). Moreover, AT E Sp(n) 
and J E Sp(n). 
Proof. By multiplying AT JA = J with A-I from the right and with (AT)-1 from 
the left, we find J = (AT) -1 J A-I so that A-I E Sp( n). Taking now the inverse 
on both sides of the latter identity we find J- 1 = AJ-1 AT, and since J- 1 = -J 
we find (AT)T JAT = J and AT E Sp(n) .• 
Note that if a 2n by 2n matrix is written in block form 
(1.13) 
with respect to the splitting ]R2n = ]Rn x ]Rn, it is symplectic if and only if 
ATe, BTD are symmetric and ATD - eTB = 1, 
as is readily verified. For example, a matrix U having B = 0 is symplectic if and 
only if A is nonsingular and U can be written as 
with some symmetric matrix S.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Definition. If (VI, WI) and (V2, W2) are two symplectic vector spaces we call a linear 
map A : VI -
V2 symplectic if 
where, by definition, (A*W2)(U,V) = w2(Au,Av) for all u,v E VI. Clearly A is 
injective such that dim VI ~ dim V2. 
Proposition 3. If (VI, WI) and (V2' W2) are two symplectic spaces of the same dimen-
sion, then there exists a linear isomorphism A : VI -
V2 satisfying A*W2 = WI. 
This means that all symplectic vector spaces of the same dimension are, in this 
sense, equivalent; they are symplectically indistinguishable. 
Proof. The proof follows immediately from the normal form in Proposition 1. 
Choosing symplectic bases (ej, fJ) in (VI, WI) and (ej, }j) in (V2' W2) we define the 
linear map A : VI -
V2 by 
for 1 ~ j ~ n. Then clearly A*W2 = WI by definition of a symplectic basis .• 
Since the choice of el and el in the construction of the symplectic bases is at our 
disposal we conclude from the above proof that the group Sp( n) acts transitively 
in JR2n. Moreover, it also acts transitively on the set of symplectic subspaces ofJR2n 
having the same dimension. This follows because a symplectic basis in a subspace 
E can always be completed to a basis of V by adding a symplectic basis of its 
complement E.L, as we did in the proof of Proposition 1. 
1.2 Symplectic diffeomorphisms and Hamiltonian 
vector fields in (JR2n, wo) 
We now turn to nonlinear maps in the symplectic space (JR2n, wo). A diffeomor-
phism <p in ]R.2n is called symplectic if 
(1.14) 
<P*Wo = Wo, 
where, by definition, the pullback of any 2-form W is given by 
(<p*w)x(a,b) = W<p(x)(<p'(x)a, <p'(x)b) 
for x E JR2n and for all a, b E TxJR2n = JR2n. Here <p'(x) denotes the derivative 
of <p at the point x represented by the Jacobian matrix. In view of the definition 
of wo, a symplectic diffeomorphism in (JR2n, wo) is, therefore, characterized by the 
identity 
(1.15) 
<p'(xf J <p'(x) = J, x E ]R.2n

for the first derivatives of r.p. Hence r.p'(x) is a symplectic matrix and, in particular, 
(1.16) 
detr.p'(x) = 1, 
so that symplectic diffeomorphisms are volume-preserving. However, if n > 1 the 
class of symplectic diffeomorphisms is much more restricted than that of volume-
preserving diffeomorphisms. This will become clear below when, taking our lead 
from Gromov, we look at the question: what can be done with symplectic diffeo-
morphisms? 
A symplectic diffeomorphism r.p in (l~2n, wo) not only preserves Wo and the 
associated volume form n but also the action of closed curves, as we shall see 
next. The form Wo is an exact form, since

Therefore, ).. - r.p* ).. is a closed form provided r.p is symplectic. Indeed, d()" - r.p* )..) = 
d)" - d(r.p*)..) = d)" - r.p*d)" = Wo - r.p*wo = O. Using the Poincare lemma one finds 
a function F : jR2n ---> jR satisfying

If 'Y is an oriented simply closed curve we can integrate and find in view of (1.18)

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
in ]R.2n we conclude that cp is symplectic. Parameterizing '"Y by x(t), with 0 ~ t ~ 1 
and x(O) = x(l), the action becomes

A('"'!) = ~ J

Examples of symplectic diffeomorphisms are generated by the so-called Hamilto-
nian vector fields which we now recall. To the symplectic form Wo and to a smooth 
function 
H : ]R.2n ~ ]R., 
we can associate a vector field X H on ]R.2n by requiring 
(1.22) 
WO(XH(x),a) = -dH(x)a 
for all a E ]R.2n and x E ]R.2n. Since Wo is nondegenerate, the vector XH(X) is deter-
mined uniquely. The condition (1.22) is equivalent to (JXH(x),a) = -("VH(x),a) 
where the gradient of H is, as usual, defined with respect to the Euclidean inner 
product. Therefore, JXH(X) = -"VH(x) and in view of J2 = -1 we find the 
representation 
(1.23) 
Clearly the Hamiltonian vector fields are very special. They differ in particular 
sharply from vector fields X = "V H (x) of gradient type, since J is antisymmetric. 
In the following we denote by cpt the flow of a vector field X. It is defined by 
The curve x(t) = cpt(x) solves the Cauchy initial value problem for the initial 
condition x E ]R.2n. Assume now that X = X H is the Hamiltonian vector field 
determined by Wo and H. Then every flow map cpt preserves the form Wo: 
(1.24) 
and is, therefore, a symplectic map. This is easily verified and will be proved in 
the next section in a more abstract setting. 
It is useful for the following to recall the transformation formula for vector 
fields X on ]R.m. Assume x( t) is a solution of the differential equation 

1.3 HAMILTONIAN VECTOR FIELDS AND SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS

If u : ]Rm ----+ ]Rm is a diffeomorphism we can define the curve y(t) by 
Differentiating in t we conclude that y( t) solves the equation 
if = Y (y), 
Y E ]Rm 
for the transformed vector field Y defined by 
Y(y) = dU(y)-1. X 0 u(y). 
In the following, we shall use the notation 
(1.25) 
u* X: = (du)-1. X 0 u. 
We have demonstrated that the two flows <pt of X and 'ljJt of u* X are conjugated 
by the diffeomorphism u, i.e., 
<pt 0 U = U 0 'ljJt . 
If we subject a Hamiltonian vector field X H in ]R2n to an arbitrary transformation u 
its special form will be destroyed. However, a symplectic transformation preserves 
the class of Hamiltonian vector fields. Indeed, if u*wo = Wo then 
(1.26) 
u* X H = X K 
and K = H 0 u. 
This is easily verified: defining the function K as the composition K = H 0 u, 
then by the chain rule, dK = dH 0 u . du, and the gradient with respect to the 
Euclidean scalar product becomes V K = (du) TV H 0 u. By assumption, du is, at 
every point, a symplectic map and, therefore, also (du)T so that du· J. (du)T = J. 
Consequently, in view of the definition (1.23) of a Hamiltonian vector field 
XK 
JVK = J(du)TVHou 
as we set out to prove. 
1.3 
Hamiltonian vector fields and symplectic manifolds 
In order to introduce Hamiltonian vector fields on a manifold, we first have to 
extend the symplectic structure 
n 
Wo = L dYj /\ dXj 
on 
]R2n 
j=1 
to even dimensional manifolds. 

10 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Definition. A symplectic structure on an even dimensional manifold M is a 2-form 
w on M satisfying 
(i) 
dw = 0, i.e., w is a closed form. 
(ii) 
w is nondegenerate. 
The second condition requires that for every tangent space TxM: if Wx ( u, v) = 0 
for all v E TxM then u = o. The pair (M,w) is then called a symplectic manifold. 
Thus every tangent space TxM of a symplectic manifold becomes a symplectic 
vector space with respect to the distinguished antisymmetric and nondegenerate 
bilinear form Wx at x. Therefore, M has even dimension. 
An example is the symplectic manifold (ffi.2n , wo); indeed, since Wo is a constant 
form we have dwo = O. Since the symplectic form w is assumed to be closed, every 
symplectic manifold looks, locally, like (ffi.2n , wo); we shall now prove that there 
are always local coordinates in which the symplectic form is represented by the 
constant form woo 
Theorem 1. (Darboux) Suppose w is a nondegenerate 2-form on a manifold of 
dim M = 2n. Then dw = 0 if and only if at each point p E M there are coordinates 
(U, 'P) where 'P : (Xl, ... , Xn, Yl,···, Yn) ~ q E U c M satisfies 'P(O) = p and 
n 
'P*w = Wo = L dYj 1\ dXj. 
j=l 
Such coordinates are sometimes called symplectic coordinates. They are clearly 
not determined uniquely; the most general coordinates of this sort are related to 
(x,y) by symplectic transformation u*wo = Wo in ffi.2n , as previously introduced. 
We see that we can define a symplectic manifold alternatively as follows: it is 
a manifold of dim M = 2n for which there are local coordinates 'Pj mapping 
open sets Uj C M onto open sets of the fixed symplectic space (ffi.2n , wo) such 
that the coordinates changes 'Pi 0 'Pjl defined on 'Pj(Ui n Uj ) are symplectic local 
diffeomorphisms in (ffi.2n , wo). 
Proof. Choosing any local coordinates, we may assume that w is a 2-form on ffi.2n 
depending on z E ffi.2n and that p corresponds to z = o. By a linear change of 
coordinates we can achieve that the form be in normal form at the origin, i.e., 
n 
w(O) = L dYj 1\ dXj 
at z = o. 
j=l 
This is precisely the same as the statement that any nondegenerate antisymmet-
ric bilinear form can be brought into normal form (Proposition 1). With Wo we 
shall denote the constant form "L;dYj 1\ dx j on ffi.2n . The aim is to find a local 
diffeomorphism 'P in a neighborhood of 0 leaving the origin fixed and solving 
'P*w = woo 

1.3 HAMILTONIAN VECTOR FIELDS AND SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
11 
We shall solve this equation by a deformation argument. We interpolate wand Wo 
by a family Wt of forms defined by 
Wt = Wo + t(w - wo) ,OS t S 1, 
such that Wt = Wo for t = 0 and WI = w, and look for a whole family <.pt of 
diffeomorphisms satisfying <.po = id and 
(1.27) 
The diffeomorphism <.pt for t = 1 will then be the solution to our problem. In order 
to find <.pt we shall construct a t-dependent vector field X t generating <.pt as its 
flow. Differentiating (1.27), such a vector field X t has to satisfy the identity 
(1.28) 
Here L y denotes the Lie derivative of the vector field Y. Now we use Cartan's 
identity 
(1.29) 
Lx = ix 0 d + do ix 
and the assumption that dWt = 0 and find 
Hence, X t has to satisfy the linear equation 
(1.30) 
In order to solve this equation we observe that W -
Wo is closed, hence, locally 
exact by the Poincare lemma and there is a I-form A satisfying 
W - Wo = dA 
and 
A(O) = o. 
Since Wt(O) = Wo the 2-forms Wt are nondegenerate for 0 S t S 1 in an open 
neighborhood of the origin and hence there is a unique vector field X t determined 
by 
ixtwt = Wt(Xt,·) = -A 
for 0 S t S 1 which then solves the equation (1.30). Since we normalized A(O) = 0 
we have Xt(O) = 0 and there is an open neighborhood of the origin on which the 
flow <.pt of X t exists for all 0 S t SLIt satisfies <.po = id and <.pt(O) = o. We can 
follow our arguments backwards: by construction this family <.pt of diffeomorphisms 
satisfies 
d ( t)* 
dt <.p 
Wt = 0, 
Os t S 1, 
hence (<.pt)*Wt = (<.p°)*wo = Wo for all 0 S t S 1, as we wanted to prove .• 

12 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
The method employed in the proof above is the so-called deformation method 
of J. Moser. Its unusual aspect is that one searches for a differential equation to be 
solved. J. Moser introduced the method in [160] in order to prove, in particular, 
that two symplectic structures Wo and WI on a compact manifold M are equivalent, 
in the sense that 
rp*WI = Wo 
for a diffeomorphism rp of M, provided the forms can be deformed into each other 
within the class of symplectic forms having their periods fixed. Incidentally, the 
classification of symplectic forms up to equivalence is still open. 
From Darboux's normal form we conclude that any two symplectic manifolds 
having the same dimension are locally indistinguishable: symplectic manifolds do 
not possess any local symplectic invariants other than the dimension. This is in 
sharp contrast to Riemannian manifolds: two different metrics generally are not 
locally isometric, e.g., the Gaussian curvature is an invariant. It is our aim later 
on to construct global symplectic invariants. 
Every manifold M carries a Riemannian structure. In contrast, not every even 
dimensional manifold admits a symplectic structure. For example, spheres s2n do 
not admit a symplectic structure if n ;::: 2. Indeed, arguing by contradiction we 
assume W is a symplectic structure. Then n = W /\ W /\ ... /\ W (n times) is a 
volume form, since W is nondegenerate. But W = do. for a I-form a on s2n since 
the second de Rham cohomology group vanishes: H2(S2n) = O. Therefore, n = df3 
with f3 = W /\ W /\ ... /\ W /\ a and by Stokes' theorem 
which is, of course, not possible for a volume form. This argument evidently applies 
to any compact manifold M without boundary having H2j(M) = 0 for some 
l~j~n-l. 
Next we introduce the analogue of symplectic maps in (JR2n, wo). A differen-
tiable map f: MI ---+ M2 between two symplectic manifolds (Ml,WI) and (M2,W2) 
is called symplectic if 
where, by definition of the pullback of a 2-form W 
(f*W)x(u, v) = Wf(x) (df(x)u, df(x)v) for all u, v E TxM. 
Since WI is nondegenerate the tangent map df(x) must be injective at every point 
and hence dimMI ~ dimM2 • If dimMI = dimM2 then f is a local diffeomor-
phism. In the case that f maps a symplectic manifold (M,w) into itself the con-
dition for f to be symplectic becomes 
f*w 
W, 

l.3 HAMILTONIAN VECTOR FIELDS AND SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
13 
i.e., f preserves the symplectic structure. Expressed in the distinguished local 
symplectic coordinates defined by Darboux's theorem, this condition for f agrees 
with our previous condition for a map to be symplectic in (~2n, wo). It is useful to 
point out that locally such a symplectic map can be presented in terms of a single 
function on ~2n, a so-called generating function and we refer to the Appendix for 
details. 
The symplectic structure, being nondegenerate, defines an isomorphism be-
tween vector fields X and I-forms on M given by X t-+ w(X, .). In particular, 
if 
H:M~~ 
is a smooth function on M, then dH is a I-form on M and hence together with w 
determines the vector field X H by 
(1.31) 
x E M. This distinguished vector field XH is called the Hamiltonian vector field 
belonging to the function H. Since dw = 0 we deduce from (1.31) using Carlan's 
formula Lx = dix + ixd and ddH = 0 that 
(1.32) 
LxHw = O. 
We conclude that the maps t.pt belonging to the flow of a Hamiltonian vector field 
X H leave the symplectic form invariant, 
(1.33) 
hence are symplectic. Indeed, the derivative ft(t.pt)*w = (t.pt)* Lxw = 0 vanishes 
in view of (1.32) and since (t.p°)*w = w the claim follows. The set of Hamiltonian 
vector fields is invariant under symplectic transformations as we shall verify next. 
Recall that u* X = (du)-l X 0 u for a vector field X and a diffeomorphism u, and, 
equivalently, t.pt 0 U = U 0 '¢t for the associated flows t.pt of X and '¢t of u* X. 
Proposition 4. If u : M ~ M satisfies u*w = w then for every function H: M ~ ~ 
u* XH = XK and K = H 0 u. 
Proof. In view of the definition of a Hamiltonian vector field 
-d(H 0 u) 
-u*(dH) 
and since w is nondegenerate the vector fields X Hou and u* X H must be equal. • 
From the symplectic structure we shall deduce an auxiliary structure which 
will be convenient later on. Recall that an almost complex structure on a manifold 
M associates smoothly with every x E M a linear map J = Jx : TxM ~ TxM 
satisfying J2 = -1. 

14 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Proposition 5. If (M, w) is a symplectic manifold there exists an almost complex 
structure J on M and a Riemannian metric (., .) on M satisfying 
(1.34) 
wx(v,Ju) = (v,u)x 
for v, u E TxM. From the symmetry of the bilinear form (-, .) it follows that 
(1.35) 
wx(Jv, Ju) = wx(v, u), 
i.e., J is a symplectic map of the symplectic vector space (TxM, wx). Moreover, 
(1.36) 
J* = J- 1 = -J, 
where J* is the adjoint of J in the inner product space (TxM, (-, -)x). 
Proof. We choose any Riemannian metric 9 on M. Fixing a point x E M we shall 
construct J = Jx in TxM. All the constructions will depend smoothly on x and, for 
notational convenience, the dependence on x will not be explicitly mentioned. Since 
w is nondegenerate there exists a unique linear isomorphism A : TxM ----> TxM 
satisfying 
w(u, v) = g(Au, v), 
u, v E TxM. 
Since w is antisymmetric we infer g(Au,v) = w(u,v) = -w(v,u) = -g(Av,u) = 
-g(v, A*u) = g( -A*u, v), where A* is the g-adjoint map of A. Hence 
A* = -A. 
Consequently, A* A = AA* = _A2 is a positive definite g-self-adjoint map and we 
denote by Q = vi-A 2 the positive square root of - A 2 • Set 
Since A and A* do commute, A is a normal operator and consequently A and Q-1 
commute and we compute 
Finally, 
w(u, Jv) 
g(Au, Jv) = g(Au, AQ-1v) 
g(A* Au, Q-1v) = g(Q2u, Q-1v) 
g(Qu, v). 
Since Q is symmetric and positive definite we conclude that 
(u,v): = g(Qu,v) 
defines a Riemannian metric on M which, in general, is different from g. It is the 
desired metric. The remainder of the statement is now readily verified making use 

1.3 HAMILTONIAN VECTOR FIELDS AND SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
15 
of the fact that the metric (u, v) = (v, u) is symmetric. Sffice the construction 
depends smoothly on x the proof is completed .• 
This almost complex structure compatible with w extends the complex struc-
ture in (JR2n, wo) considered above. Moreover, if 'V H denotes the gradient of a 
function H with respect to the Riemannian metric (.,.) of Proposition 5, i.e., 
('VH(x),v) = dH(x)v for all v E TxM, we find for the Hamiltonian vector field 
X H the representation 
(1.37) 
using that J2 = -1. This agrees with the representation of XH in (JR2n,wo). 
We should point out that the almost complex structure is not unique. If we 
denote by Jw the set of almost complex structures compatible with w in the sense 
of (1.34), it can easily be shown that this set is contractible. Indeed, for every 
J E Jw there exists, by definition, a unique Riemannian metric gJ satisfying 
w(u,Jv) = gJ(u,v). Starting from any Riemannian metric g, we constructed in 
the proof of the proposition an almost complex structure J = Jg and a metric gJ 
such that JgJ = J. Hence, fixing any metric g* on M, we can define the contraction 
in Jw by 
for 0 ::; t ::; 1 and J E Jw. 
In view of Darboux's theorem there are locally no symplectic invariants other 
than the dimension. On the other hand, the total volume is a trivial example of 
a global symplectic invariant. Indeed, if u : (Ml' wt} ~ (M2' W2) is a symplectic 
diffeomorphism of Ml onto M2 then it follows from U*W2 = Wl that the associated 
volume forms fh = Wl 1\ ... 1\ Wl (n times) on Ml and similarly n2 on M2 are 
related by 
(1.38) 
Since the diffeomorphism u : Ml ~ M2 preserves the orientation we have 
J 
U*n2 = J n2 
Ml 
M2 
and in view of (1.38), 
J n1 J n2 , 
Ml 
M2 
so that the total volumes of n1 and n2 have to agree. Consider now the special case 
of compact, connected and oriented manifolds of dimension 2, i.e., surfaces. The 
orientation will be given by a volume form denoted by w. It evidently is a closed 
form, since every 3-form on a surface vanishes. Therefore, (M,w) is a symplectic 
manifold with the volume form as the symplectic structure. 

16 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Assume now that (MI,wd and (M2' W2) are two such surfaces and let u : MI ----7 
M2 be a symplectic diffeomorphism U*W2 = WI, which in dimension 2 is the same 
as a volume-preserving diffeomorphism, then 
(1.39) 
so that the volumes agree. Our aim is to prove the converse. We shall prove that if 
two compact, connected and oriented surfaces (MI' WI) and (M2' W2) are diffeomor-
phic (which is the case if their Euler characteristics are equal) and if, in addition, 
their total volumes agree, then there exists a diffeomorphism u : MI ----7 M 2 , which 
satisfies U*W2 = WI. This gives a classification of compact connected 2-dimensional 
symplectic manifolds according to the Euler characteristic and the total volume. 
More generally we shall prove the following statement for volume preserving dif-
feomorphisms. 
Theorem 2. (Moser) Assume M is a compact, connected and oriented manifold of 
dimension m without boundary. If a and (3 are two volume forms such that their 
total volumes agree, i.e., 
(1.40) 
J a = J 
(3, 
M 
M 
then there is a diffeomorphism u of M satisfying u* (3 = a. 
Consequently the total volume is the only invariant of volume-preserving dif-
feomorphisms. 
Proof. We proceed as in the proof of Darboux's theorem and deform the volume 
form a into (3 defining 
at = (1 - t)a + t(3, 
O:s: t :s: 1. 
These forms at are volume forms since locally a and (3 are represented by a = 
a(x)dxII\ ... I\dxm and (3 = b(x)dxII\ ... I\dxm with nonvanishing smooth functions 
a and b, which, by assumption (1.40), must have the same sign. We shall construct 
a family 'Pt of diffeomorphisms satisfying 
(1.41) 
for 0 :s: t :s: 1, so that the diffeomorphism u = 'PI will solve our problem. Since M 
is compact, connected and oriented we conclude from J ((3 - a) = 0 that 
M 
(1.42) 
(3 - a = dry 

1.3 HAMILTONIAN VECTOR FIELDS AND SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
17 
for some (m - I)-form "I on M. This is a special case of the de Rham theorem. 
Since at is a volume form we find a unique time-dependent vector field X t on M 
solving the linear equation 
i Xt at = -"I 
for 0 ::; t ::; 1. Denote by 'Pt the flow of this vector field X t satisfying 'Po = id. 
Since M is compact it exists for all t. Since dOt = 0 for volume forms we find, 
again using Cartan's formula, 
('Pt)* (Lx,Ot + it at ) 
('Pt)*(d(iXtOt) + 13-0), 
which vanishes since d(ixtot) + 13 - a = d(ixtot + "I) = 0 by our choice of the 
vector field X t . Therefore (1.41) holds and the proof is finished .• 
We have seen that symplectic diffeomorphisms are volume-preserving diffeo-
morphisms so that the total volume is a (trivial) global symplectic invariant. More-
over, for volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, this is the only invariant. One of our 
aims later on is to establish symplectic invariants other than the volume which 
will prove that symplectic diffeomorphisms are of a different nature than volume-
preserving diffeomorphisms. An example of such a global symplectic invariant is 
prompted by Darboux's theorem. Recall that this theorem states that locally near 
every point on a symplectic manifold (M, w) there is a local diffeomorphism 'P 
from a small ball of ]R2n into M satisfying 'P*w = wo0 This means in particular 
that there is always a symplectic embedding of a small open ball B(r) into M, 
'P : (B(r),wo) ---+ (M,w), 
where B(r) = {x E ]R2n IIxl2 < r2}. 
We should mention that this is, of course, only a local result; even on ]R2n with 
n ~ 2 there exist symplectic structures w of infinite volume for which there is 
no diffeomorphism 'P of ]R2n solving 'P*w = WOo The existence of such an exotic 
symplectic structure is a deep result due to M. Gromov [107]. 
We now look for the largest ball B(r) c ]R2n which can be symplectically 
embedded into a given symplectic manifold (M,w) of dimension dimM = 2n, and 
define 
D(M,w) = sup {7rr2 I there eXlistt~ 
b dd. 
'P: (B(r),wo) ---+ (M,w)}. 
a symp ec IC em e 
mg 
This is a positive number or 00 which we shall call the Gromov width of (M,w). 
At this point we cannot explain why we choose 7rr2 in the definition and not, 
for example, the volume of B(r). We mention, however, that 7rr2 agrees with 
the action IAb)1 for every closed characteristic "I on the boundary 8B(r) of the 
standard sphere of radius r in ]R2n. This will be explained later on. 

18 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
It is easy to see that D(M,w) is a symplectic invariant. We first show that 
D( M, w) has a monotonicity property in the sense that 
(1.43) 
D(M,w) :::; D(N,T), 
if there exists a symplectic embedding 'lj; : M -> N. To every symplectic embedding 
i.p : B(r) -> M there is a symplectic embedding B(r) -> N defined by 'lj; 0 i.p. 
Therefore, the supremum in the definition of D(N, T) is taken over a possibly 
larger set so that indeed D(N,T) 2: D(M,w) as claimed. If I : M -> N is a 
symplectic diffeomorphism of M onto N we can apply the monotonicity property 
to I and also to 1- 1 and conclude: 
Proposition 6. If (M, w) and (N, T) are symplectically isomorphic, then D(M, w) = 
D(N,T). 
We see that the Gromov width is a symplectic invariant. It will turn out, and 
this is not obvious, that this invariant is quite different form the total volume 
if n 2: 2. The Gromov width is merely one example in the class of symplectic 
invariants called symplectic capacities which will be introduced in Chapter 2. 
1.4 Periodic orbits on energy surfaces 
The existence problem we shall briefly describe originates in the search for periodic 
solutions in celestial mechanics and is, as we shall see in Chapter 4, related to 
special symplectic invariants. For simplicity we consider the standard symplectic 
manifold (ffi.2n , wo). We have seen that a function H : ffi.2n -> ffi. together with Wo 
determines the Hamiltonian vector field X H on ffi.2n by 
(1.44) 
iXHWO = -dH. 
The flow i.pt of the vector field X H leaves the function H invariant, i.e., 
(1.45) 
for all t for which the flow is defined, hence H is an integral of X H . Indeed differ-
entiating (1.45) we find, using the definition of the flow 
dH(i.pt) . 1ti.pt = dH(i.pt). XH(i.pt) 
-Wo ( X H , X H ) 0 (i.pt) , 
which vanishes since Wo is antisymmetric. Geometrically, the level sets 

1.4 PERIODIC ORBITS ON ENERGY SURFACES 
19 
are invariant under the flow of X H . We shall assume now that S is a compact 
regular energy surface, i.e., 
(1.46) 
dH(x) -=I- 0 for xES. 
Then S is a smooth hypersurface, i.e., a submanifold of ffi.2n of co dimension 1, 
whose tangent space at xES is given by 
S 
Fig. 1.1 
Evidently XH(X) E TxS for xES since dH(x)·XH(X) = -wo(XH(x), XH(X)) = 0, 
so that XH defines a vector field on S which does not vanish. Since S is compact the 
flow cpt on S exists for all times. It should be emphasized that this flow is, in general, 
extremely complicated, since Hamiltonian vector fields describe systems without 
friction in which oscillations never decrease. However, the flow on S has strong 
recurrence properties due to the volume-preserving character of Hamiltonian flows. 
We shall briefly recall this phenomenon known to H. Poincare. 
Let n = Wo /\ ... /\ Wo be the volume form on ffi.2n . Since dH(x) -=I- 0 in a 
neighborhood U of S we find a (2n - I)-form a on U satisfying 
(1.47) 
n = dH /\ a 
on U. 
Denoting by j : S -+ ffi.2n the inclusion mapping, the (2n - I)-form 
(1.48) 
f-L = j*a on S 
is clearly a volume form on S. It is uniquely determined by (1.47). Indeed, if 
n = dH /\ a = dH /\ (3 then dH /\ (a - (3) = 0 so that a -
(3 = dH /\ 'Y for a 
(2n - 2)-form 'Y on U. In view of j* dH = 0 we find j* a = j* (3 + j* (dH /\ 'Y) = j* (3 
as claimed. The volume form f-L is invariant under the flow cpt of X H : 
(1.49) 

20 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
This follows from (cpt) * n = nand (cpt) * dH = dH. Indeed, in view of (1.47) we first 
find n = dH 1\ (cpt)*a, and using the uniqueness we conclude j*(cpt)*a = j*a. 
But cpt 0 j = j 0 cpt and hence (cpt)*(j*a) = (j*a), proving the claim (1.49). If we 
denote the regular measure on S associated to the form /-l by m we see that 
(1.50) 
m(cpt(A)) = m(A) , 
A c S. 
Moreover, m(S) < 00 since S is compact. 
Theorem 3. (Poincare's recurrence theorem) Let S be a compact and regular energy 
surface of the Hamiltonian vector field X H with flow cpt. Then almost every point 
(with respect to m) on S is a recurrent point, i.e., for almost every xES there is 
a sequence tj 1 00 satisfying 
lim cpti(X) 
x. 
J-+OO 
Proof. The proof is surprisingly easy. By cp we denote the time-1 map of the flow 
cpt. We first use the invariance and finiteness of the measure to show that for every 
AcS 
(1.51) 
m( An [n U cp-j(A)]) = m(A). 
k'20j'2k 
Observe that the points x in the above set [ . 1 are those points xES which have 
the property that for every integer k there is an integer j ~ k such that x E cp-j (A) 
i.e., cpj(x) EA. The intersection with A consists of the points x in A which return 
infinitely often to the set A. In order to prove (1.51) we abbreviate 
Ak := U cp-j (A), 
k = 0,1,2, ... 
j'2k 
and have the decreasing sequence of subsets Ao :::> Al :::> A2 :::> •••. Clearly, 
cpk(Ak) = Ao and consequently m(Ak) = m(Ao) since cp preserves the measure. 
Since m(Ao) < 00 we conclude that Ao = Ak almost everywhere for k = 0,1,2, ... 
and consequently, n Ak = Ao almost everywhere. Hence, in view of A c Ao we 
k'20 
find 
Ann Ak = A n Ao = A almost everywhere, 
k'20 
which is the desired equation (1.51). Now we use the topological fact that there is 
a countable basis in S. For every n there are count ably many open balls B j ( ~) of 
radius ~ covering S. Applying the first step to every ball, we find a null set N c S 
having the property that every x E S\N returns infinitely often to every ball to 
which it belongs. Since for every n there exists a j = j(x) such that x E Bj(~), 
the theorem is proved .• 

1.4 PERIODIC ORBITS ON ENERGY SURFACES 
21 
We note that the compactness is not relevant: the statement follows if the 
invariant measure on 8 is finite and the topology of 8 has a countable basis. 
This observation allowed Poincare to apply his theorem to the restricted 3-body 
problem. 
In view of the recurrence theorem it seems quite natural to search for periodic 
phenomena on 8. One could hope that by perturbing the Hamiltonian system 
slightly some of the recurrent points do not only return infinitely often but close 
up in finite time, thus giving rise to a periodic orbit. This is the so-called Closing 
Problem. In their celebrated Closing-Lemma, C.C. Pugh and C. Robinson ([179] 
1983) proved that generically (in the C 2-category of the Hamiltonian functions) the 
periodic orbits are dense on a compact and regular energy surface. In sharp contrast 
to this generic phenomenon we are interested in the following global existence 
question: 
Question. Does a compact and regular energy surface 8 in (~2n, wo) possess a 
periodic solution of the Hamiltonian vector field X H ? 
The question is still open. It should be emphasized that we are looking for 
periodic solutions of a very restricted class of vector fields on 8 and recall that H. 
Seifert ([193], 1950) raised the question, whether every nonvanishing vector field 
on the three sphere 8 3 has a closed orbit. The problem remained open for many 
years. In 1974, P.A. Schweitzer [192] constructed a surprising vector field in the 
class C 1 on 8 3 which has no periodic solutions, and only very recently in 1993 
K. Kuperberg [132] gave an example of a Coo vector field on 8 3 with no periodic 
solutions. For manifolds with dimension higher than three the question had been 
answered similarly in 1966 by F.W. Wilson [228]. One could ask whether there 
are vector fields in the more restricted class of measure-preserving smooth vector 
fields not admitting any periodic solution. For the special class of Reeb vector 
fields, however, the existence of closed orbits has been established quite recently 
by H. Hofer [118]: every smooth Reeb vector field on 8 3 possesses a periodic orbit. 
A vector field X on 8 3 is called a Reeb vector field, if there exists a I-form>. on 
8 3 with>' /I. d>' defining a volume form and satisfying 
ixd>. = 0 and ix>' = 1. 
We shall come back to Reeb vector fields in Chapter 4 in connection with the 
Weinstein conjecture on contact manifolds. 
It will be crucial later on that the above question is independent of the par-
ticular choice of the Hamiltonian function representing 8. It only depends on the 
hypersurface and the symplectic structure. This fact is well-known from the regu-
larization of collision singularities in the celestial 2-body problem. Assume that F 
is a second function defining 8, such that 
(1.52)

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
with dH i- 0 and dF i- 0 on S. Then kerdF(x) = kerdH(x) and, therefore, 
dF(x) = p(x)dH(x) for every xES, with a nowhere-vanishing smooth function 
p. Consequently, the Hamiltonian vector fields are parallel: 
(1.53) 
with p(x) i- O. It follows that X H and X F have the same orbits on S although 
their parametrization will be different, in general. To be more precise, if rpt is the 
flow of X H on S, then the flow 'ljJs of X F on S is given by 
(1.54) 
'ljJS(x) = rpt(x), t = t(s,x), 
XES, 
where the function t is defined by the differential equation 
~: = p(rpt(x)), 
t(O,x) = a, 
depending on the parameter xES. We see that, in particular, XH has the same 
periodic orbits as X F. 
For example, if X H has the energy surface S = {x E ]R2n I ! Ixl 2 = R > a}, then 
all the solutions of XH on S are periodic. Indeed, also the Hamiltonian F defined 
by F(x) = ! Ixl2 represents S = {x I F(x) = R} as a regular energy surface. The 
vector field X F is linear and has the flow 
'ljJS(x) = esJ x = (cos s)x + (sin s)Jx, 
which evidently is periodic. 
We can reformulate the problem more abstractly in terms of a distinguished 
line bundle. Assume S is a hypersurface in ]R2n. Then TxS has dimension 2n - 1 
so that the restriction of Wo onto TxS must be degenerate and of rank (2n - 2). 
Its kernel is, therefore, I-dimensional and we see that Wo and S determine the line 
bundle 
(1.55) 
If S is a regular energy surface for X H , then WO(XH(X),V) = -dH(x)v = a for all 
v E TxS. Therefore, 
for every Hamiltonian vector field having S as a regular energy surface. Conse-
quently, the periodic solutions for X H on S correspond to the closed character-
istics of the line bundle £s. These are defined as the I-dimensional submanifold 
PeS diffeomorphic to circles for which the tangent spaces belong to £s, i.e., 
TP = £sIP. Therefore, the existence question of periodic solutions of Hamilto-
nian equations on regular energy surfaces can be reformulated geometrically as 
follows: 

1.5 EXISTENCE OF A PERIODIC ORBIT ON A CONVEX ENERGY SURFACE 
23 
Question. Does a compact smooth hypersurface S C (]R2n, wo) admit a closed 
characteristic of the distinguished line bundle £s? 
Note that £s is defined by the hypersurface and woo It will be demonstrated in 
Chapter 4 that there are hypersurfaces S C ]R2n and symplectic structures w near 
S and different from Wo, such that the line bundle of S with respect to w does not 
admit closed characteristics. 
The breakthrough in this global existence question is due to A. Weinstein 
[225] and P. Rabinowitz [225] in 1978 who established the existence of a closed 
characteristic on a convex respectively star-like hypersurface in ]R2n. The proofs are 
based on variational principles. In particular P. Rabinowitz demonstrated that the 
highly degenerate action principle previously used to derive formal transformation 
properties for Hamiltonian vector fields can be used very effectively for existence 
proofs. This crucial idea turned out to be decisive in the further development in 
which the next landmark was C. Viterbo's proof of the A. Weinstein conjecture in 
]R2n in 1987. The conjecture states that every hypersurface of contact type carries 
a closed characteristic. This type of symplectically restricted hypersurfaces will be 
described in Chapter 4, which is devoted to the existence of closed characteristics 
on hypersurfaces in symplectic manifolds. We should mention that every compact 
hypersurface S gives rise to an abundance of periodic orbits which, however, are 
not necessarily on the given surface but on surfaces nearby. We illustrate this with 
a result which also will be proved in Chapter 4. Assume the hypersurface S belongs 
to a family defined by 
Se; = {x I H(x) = 1 + c} C ]R2n 
for c in an interval I around 0, where S corresponds to So. 
Theorem 4. For almost every eEl, the hypersurface Se; in ]R2n possesses a periodic 
solution for X H . 
In Chapter 4 we shall easily deduce this phenomenon from a distinguished 
symplectic invariant. 
1.5 
Existence of a periodic orbit on a convex energy surface 
In this section we shall prove a very special qualitative existence result, which 
historically marked the beginning of a rapid development in global questions of 
symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics. Our purpose is to illustrate the 
classical technique of direct methods of the calculus of variations. This technique 
is in sharp contrast to the more recent technique introduced in Chapter 3. In 
Chapter 4 the result itself will be an immediate consequence of the existence of a 
special symplectic invariant.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Theorem 5. Assume the hypersurface S C (]R2n, wo) is the smooth (in the class 
C2) boundary of a compact and strictly convex region in ]R2n. Then S carries a 
closed orbit. 
We conclude, in particular, that every Hamiltonian vector field X H having S 
as a regular energy surface possesses a periodic solution on S. The result is due to 
P. Rabinowitz [180] and A. Weinstein [225], 1978. The proof we shall give below 
is based on an idea due to F. Clarke [53]. 
In order to prove the theorem we make use of the freedom to choose a convenient 
Hamiltonian function and introduce a particular Hamiltonian H which is positively 
homogeneous of degree 2 and which represents the hypersurface as S = {x E 
]R2n I H(x) = I}. S is the boundary of a compact and strictly convex region C 
in ]R2n, and we may assume that C contains the origin in its interior. Then each 
ray issuing from the origin meets S in exactly one point nontangentially. Thus if 
x =f. 0 is given, there is a unique point e = A-Ix on S, where A > O. 
x 
C 
Fig. 1.2 
If we define the function F on ]R2n by F(x) = A if e = A-Ix E S for x =f. 0, 
and F(O) = 0, then the manifold S is represented by S = {x I F(x) = I}. We 
would like to describe S in terms of a strictly convex function H as the level set 
{x I H(x) = I}, i.e., a function whose Hessian Hxx(x) is positive definite at every 
point x =f. O. Since F is homogeneous of degree 1, it is obviously never strictly 
convex. Indeed, differentiating Euler's formula (Fx, x) = F gives Fxxx = O. By the 
convexity assumption Fxx ITS> O. Therefore, we define the function 
which is strictly convex precisely if S is strictly convex as one proves without diffi-
culty. We thus have shown that every strictly convex energy surface S containing

25 
the origin in its interior can be represented by 
(1.56) 
S = {x I H(x) = I} 
with a function H : ]R2n ~

(iii)

In view of our discussion in the previous section, it suffices to show that this 
special Hamiltonian vector field X H possesses a periodic solution on this energy 
surface S, i.e., we have to show that there is a periodic solution of 
x = J\lH(x) 
on S. 
Normalizing the period we can ask for a periodic solution of period 27f on S for 
the equation 
(1.58) 
x='\J\lH(x) forsome '\#0. 
For example, the variational principle 
27r 
min J H(x(t))dt under 
o 
27r IJ . 
:2 
(Jx,x)=I, 
o 
where the functions x(t) are assumed to be 27f-periodic, has the above equations as 
Euler equations. But one easily shows that neither the infimum nor the supremum 
is taken on, even if H(x) = ~ Ix1 2 . The trick now is to use an alternative variational 
principle having the same differential equations for which, however, the infimum is 
taken on. We shall form the Legendre transformation of H, but in contrast to the 
usual Legendre transformation of physics, all variables will be transformed. The 
function G(y) related to H(x) by a Legendre transformation can be defined by 
G(y) = max ((~, y) -
H(~)) = (x, y) - H(x). 
t;EIR2n 
There is indeed a unique maximum x E ]R2n given by y = \lH(x), since Hxx(Y) is 
positive definite for yolO and since H satisfies 
(1.59) 
for some constant c > 1. The estimate is an immediate consequence of the homo-
geneity of H. Summarizing, we have

G(y) + H(x) = (x, y)

(1.61) 
Y = 'VH(x) 
and x = 'VG(y). 
Clearly G(O) = 0, G E C2(JR2n\ {O}) and G is positively homogeneous of degree 
2. Since Hxx(x) . Gyy(Y) = :n for x =I- 0, G is also strictly convex if y =I- 0, so that 
G enjoys the same properties as H :

cise, we define the following function space F of periodic functions z( t) = z( t + 27r) 
having mean value 0:

F = {z E Hl(81) I ;7r J

where HI (81) is the Hilbert space of absolutely continuous 27r-periodic functions 
whose derivatives are square integrable, i.e., belong to L2(81). Note that with z 
also z+ const. is a solution of (1.62), hence the condition on the mean value fixes 
the constant. By A c F we shall denote the subset 
2n 
A={ZEFI ~j(Jz,i)=l}.

Following the standard procedure we shall verify that the functional 
2n 
1(z) = j G(i(t))dt on A

meets the following properties: 
(i) It is bounded from below on A.

on 8 for an appropriate constant c. 
Ad (i): We need some estimates. Since every Z belonging to :F has mean value 
zero, the Poincare inequality 
Ilzll ~ Ilzll 
z E:F 
holds, where 11·11 denotes the £2 norm. This follows simply from the Fourier series. 
For z E A we conclude

The function G being strictly convex and positively homogeneous of degree 2

an element Z* E HI (SI) :

We have used the well-known fact that the closed unit ball of a Hilbert space is 
weakly sequentially compact. In addition, for a function z* E C(SI) ,

T 
< It - Tll/21lzjll 
< It - Tll/2v'M, 
and the claim follows from the Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Clearly z*(t) = z*(t) almost 
everywhere. Indeed, with the L2 inner product we can write (z* - z*, Z* - z*) = 
(Zj - z*' Z* - z*) + (z* - Zj, Z* - z*). The first term on the right hand side converges 
to 0 in view of the uniform convergence and the second one in view of the weak 
convergence. 
We shall show that z* E A. By (1.67) we conclude that the mean value of Z*

y(t) = x(a- 1t) is the desired periodic solution of:i; = JV'H(x) on H = 1 which 
has the period T = 271"a = 271"J.1,. But this is unimportant since the period of the 
periodic solution on S depends on our choice of the Hamiltonian function. This 
finishes the proof of the theorem .• 
Recalling the transformation properties of Hamiltonian vector fields, one con-
cludes from the above theorem that every hypersurface in ]R2n which is symplec-
tically diffeomorphic to a strictly convex one, always possesses a closed charac-
teristic. Such a situation is, however, hard to recognize and we shall see below 
that there are hypersurfaces which are not symplectically diffeomorphic to convex 
ones. It will be our aim in Chapter 4 to describe symplectically invariant prop-
erties of a hypersurface which guarantee the existence of a closed characteristic. 

1.6 THE PROBLEM OF SYMPLECTIC EMBEDDINGS 
31 
The existence will, however, be established by means of a very different variational 
principle. 
The idea of the above proof, sometimes called the dual action principle, prompt-
ed many existence results for convex Hamiltonians. For example, I. Ekeland [65] 
1984 established a Morse theory for periodic solutions on convex hypersurfaces 
which is analogous to the one for closed geodesics on compact Riemannian man-
ifolds. Using Ekeland's Morse theory he showed that generically (in the Coo cat-
egory) every compact and convex hypersurface S C JR2n carries infinitely many 
periodic orbits [65, 66, 67]. In the special case that the convex surface S C JR2n is 
close to a round sphere in the sense that 
B(r) eSc B(R) 
and 
R::; /'ir 
for two open balls of radius rand R (where the first inclusion means contained in 
the inside of S), one can prove that S carries at least n closed characteristics [70]. 
Here the convexity requirement can be relaxed somewhat and we refer to [21] for 
the precise statement. 
For an account of this circle of questions concerning convex Hamiltonians, 
we refer to the recent book by I. Ekeland: "Convexity Methods in Hamiltonian 
Mechanics" (1990), [66]. 
1.6 The problem of symplectic embeddings 
We consider two compact connected domains Dl and D2 in JRm having smooth 
boundaries. If the domains are diffeomorphic by an orientation preserving diffeo-
morphism, one can ask the question: under what additional conditions on Dl and 
D2 does there exist a volume-preserving diffeomorphism, i.e., a diffeomorphism 
r.p : Dl ~ D2 satisfying det r.p' (x) = 1 for every x in the interior of Dl? Clearly, 
is a necessary condition. It turns out that this is already the only condition which is 
also sufficient for the existence of a volume-preserving diffeomorphism. This follows 
from the following extension of Theorem 2 in Section 3 to the case of manifolds 
with boundaries. 
Theorem 6. (Dacorogna-Moser) Let Dl and D2 be two compact connected domains 
with smooth boundaries in JRm. Assume a(x) = a(x) dXl /\ ... /\ dXm is a smooth 
volume form on Dl and (3( x) = b( x )dXl/\ ... /\ dXm is a smooth volume form on D2 
with a > 0 and b > O. If r.p : Dl ~ D2 is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism, 
then there exists a diffeomorphism 'ljJ : Dl ~ D2 satisfying, in addition, 'ljJ = r.p on 
aD1 and 

32 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
where the constant A is defined by 
If, in particular, vol Dl = vol D2 we choose a = 1 and b = 1 and find A = 1 and 
det 'lj;' (x) = 1, so that 'lj; is volume-preserving. We conclude that the total volume is 
the only invariant of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. For a proof of Theorem 6 
with precise regularity conditions for the boundaries and the volume forms, we refer 
to Dacorogna and Moser [59]. In the special case ]R2, the volume form dXl/\ dX2 is 
a symplectic form and we see that the total area alone distinguishes diffeomorphic 
symplectic manifolds from each other. In higher dimensions the situation is very 
different. 
In the symplectic space (]R2n, wo) one can ask the same questions for symplec-
tic diffeomorphisms instead of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. Consider, for 
example, a symplectic diffeomorphism cp of ]R2n which maps Dl onto D2• Then it 
maps the boundary aDl of Dl onto aD2. The canonical line bundles of the two 
hypersurfaces are, therefore, isomorphic and the corresponding Hamiltonian flows 
are conjugated up to reparametrization. In particular, the actions of the corre-
sponding closed characteristics, if there are any, have to agree. We can, moreover, 
thicken the boundaries into a one parameter family of hypersurfaces. As we shall 
prove in Chapter 4, the leaves of such a foliation of a neighborhood of a hyper-
surface carry an abundance of closed characteristics. Consequently, one expects 
many symplectic invariants and we see that the problem of distinguishing diffeo-
morphic domains from the symplectic point of view is of quite a different nature 
than the volume preserving situation. Turning, therefore, to a seemingly simpler 
but related problem, we consider two open domains U and V in ]R2n and look for 
conditions which allow a symplectic embedding cp : U ~ V. This is an embedding 
cp : U ~ ]R2n satisfying, in addition, cp*wo = Wo and cp(U) c V. 
Fig. 1.3 
Since such a cp is also volume preserving we clearly have the restriction vol(U) :::; 
vol(V). The condition vol (U) < vol (V) is already sufficient to guarantee the 

1.6 THE PROBLEM OF SYMPLECTIC EMBEDDINGS 
33 
existence of a volume preserving embedding. The question arises whether there 
are obstacles apart from the volume for symplectic embeddings. Consider, for 
example, an open ball B(R) of radius R > 0: 
B(R) = { (x, Y) E ]R2n I Ixl 2 + lyI 2 < R2} 
which, of course, has finite volume. It can easily be embedded symplectic ally into 
the special open cylinders of infinite volume which are defined by 
for every r > O. Indeed, simply take the linear symplectic map 
Then cp(B(R)) C Z(r) if c > 0 is chosen sufficiently small. Note that the 2-plane 
span 
{eI, e2} of ]R2n defining this cylinder is isotropic and hence inherits no 
symplectic structure. The situation changes drastically if we replace Z(r) by the 
cylinder 
Z(r) = {(x, y) E ]R2n I x~ + y~ < r2}. 
This cylinder is defined by the 2-plane span {el,it} which is a symplectic sub-
space. Trying similarly with the map 
one finds 'ljJ(B(R)) C Z(r) if c is small. The map 'ljJ is volume preserving. But, 
'ljJ is symplectic only if c = 1 in which case we can have 'ljJ(B(R)) C Z(r) only if 
r :::: R. So far we experimented using linear symplectic mappings and one might 
hope to do better with nonlinear symplectic mappings. This is not the case. In 
1985, M. Gromov [107] discovered the following surprising result. 
Theorem 7. (Gromov's squeezing theorem) Assume there is a symplectic embedding 
cp defined on B(R) and satisfying 
cp(B(R)) c Z(r) 
then r :::: R (Fig. 1.4). 
This phenomenon demonstrates clearly that the symplectic structure of a map 
is much more rigid than the volume preserving structure. Gromov's discovery moti-
vated the search for symplectic invariants and a class of such symplectic invariants 
was constructed in 1987 by 1. Ekeland and H. Hofer [68, 69] by means of a varia-
tional principle for periodic solutions of Hamiltonian equations; the construction 
was motivated by earlier results in [67]. These invariants, described in the next 

34 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Z(r) 
Fig. 1.4 
chapter, will give an explanation of rigidity phenomena for many symplectic em-
beddings, among them the result above. 
One is tempted to give an explanation of the rigidity phenomenon above from 
a dynamical point of view. Observe that the hypersurface 8B(R) is the stan-
dard sphere on which all characteristics are closed. It is an energy surface for the 
quadratic Hamiltonian function 
1 (2 
2) 
H(x,y) = 2 Ixl + Iyl . 
The Hamiltonian equations z = JV H(z) with z E ]R2n are linear and the solutions 
z(t) = eJtz(O) 
satisfy IZ(1)12 = Iz(O)12. They are periodic with period 27r. Moreover, on 8B(R) 
they all have the same action 
A(z) = 7rR2, z(t) E 8B(R). 
Similarly, one verifies that the characteristics on 8Z(r) are all closed, wind around 
the cylinder, and have the actions A(z) = 7rr2 for z(t) c 8Z(r), quite in contrast 
to the characteristics on 8Z(r) which are straight lines. If now r.p is a symplectic 
embedding of B(R), then on 8r.p(B(R)) the characteristics are also closed and have 
the actions 7r R2. Imagine now that there is an "optimal embedding" of B(R) into 
Z(r) in which case one is inclined to think that the boundary ofthe embedded ball 
touches the boundary of the cylinder and that this is happening along a closed 
characteristic. We then conclude in view of the invariance of the actions that r = R. 
A proof of Gromov's theorem along these lines does not exist and we shall proceed 
differently later on.

1.7 
Symplectic classification of positive definite quadratic forms 
Before we turn to the subtle problem of embedding an open set in another one using 
a symplectic map, it is useful to study the special case in which the open sets are 
ellipsoids and the symplectic maps under consideration are linear. We start with an 
algebraic observation well-known in mechanics. Recall that a function q : V -+ ]R 
on a vector space V is called a quadratic form if there is a symmetric bilinear form 
fj : V x V -+ ]R such that 
q(x) = ~ fj(x,x), x E V. 
The quadratic form q is called positive definite if fj is an inner product in V. 
Choosing a basis in V, we have the representation 
fj(x,y) 
(Sx,y) 
q(x) 
1 
T 
"2(Sx,x), S=S >0 
for x,y E V. From now on (V,w) = (]R2n,w) is the standard symplectic vector 
space with the symplectic form (previously denoted by wo) given by 
w(x, y) 
(Jx, y), 
x, Y E ]R2n 
and 
Denoting by P the set of positive definite quadratic forms on V, and by G = Sp( n) 
the group of linear symplectic maps rp of V, i.e., rp*w = w, we have the G-action 
on P defined by the composition 
P x G -+ P: 
[q, rp] f-+ q 0 rp. 
It turns out that the orbits of P under this action are characterized by n positive 
numbers. The form q can be diagonalized by means of a linear map which leaves 
the form w invariant. This algebraic fact was already known to K. Weierstrass 
[220]. 
Theorem 8. If q E P then there is a linear map rp satisfying rp* w = wand

qorp(x) ="2 L..J Aj(Xj +xn+j), 
j=1 
with 0 < An :S An-l :S ... :S AI· The numbers Aj are uniquely determined by q 
and w. Indeed (±iAj) for 1 :S j :S n are the eigenvalues of the linear Hamiltonian 
vector field Xq associated with q and w by 
w (Xq(x), y) = -dq(x)(y) 
for all x, y E ]R2n. 

36 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Postponing the proof we observe that if q(x) = ~(Sx,x) with a positive def-
inite symmetric matrix S, then Xq is the linear vector field Xq(x) = JSx, and 
if 7 E Sp( n) is any symplectic matrix, we conclude by the transformation law of 
Hamiltonian vector fields 
X qOT = 7- 1 . Xq . 7. 
Thus the two linear vector fields Xq and X qOT are similar to each other and have, 
therefore, the same eigenvalues. Associating with q the n positive real numbers 
A = A(q) E ]Rn guaranteed by the theorem, we conclude that 
A(q 0 7) = A(q) 
for all q E P and 7 E Sp(n), so that these numbers characterize the orbits of P 
under Sp(n). 
This is, of course, in contrast to the action of the orthogonal group of ma-
trices satisfying AT A = 1. Since q 0 A(x) = ~(SAx, Ax) = ~(AT SAx, x) = 
~(A-lSAx,x) we see that the orbits of P under O(2n) are determined by the 
2n positive eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix S in contrast to the n imagi-
nary eigenvalue pairs (±iAj) of J S. On ]R2, for example, a positive quadratic form 
is, after an orthogonal transformation, of the form q(x) = ~(Sx,x) with a di-
agonal matrix S = Diag (AI, A2) and Aj > O. The theorem guarantees a linear 
map 7 satisfying det 7 = 1 which transforms q into the symplectic normal form 
q 0 7(X) = ~(Qx, x) with Q = Diag (A, A). Geometrically the ellipsoid {q(x) < I} 
is symplectically mapped onto the disc {q 0 7( x) < I} having the same area. We 
see that in ]R2 the normal forms correspond to discs distinguished by the area. 
Proof. On the product space (x, y) E Vx V, the functions K(x, y) = q(x)+q(y) and 
w(x, y) are quadratic forms. Since K is positive definite we can apply a well-known 
variational argument. On the compact manifold M = M(q) defined by 
M = {(x, y) E V x V I q( x) + q(y) = I}, 
the continuous function (x, y) f-+ w(x, y) attains a maximum, say at (a, b) E M, 
such that 
w(a, b) 
max 
w(x,y). 
(x,y) EM 
We point out that a critical point (a, b) EM of wlM lies in a whole circle consisting 
of critical points belonging to the same critical level. Indeed, if we define the circle 
action on V x V by 
eit . (x,y) = (x(t),y(t)) , t E]R, 
where 
x(t) = (cos t)x + (sin t)y, 
y(t) = (cost)y - (sint)x, 

1.7 SYMPLECTIC CLASSIFICATION OF ... 
37 
then one verifies readily that the quadratic forms are invariant under the action, 
i.e., 
K(x(t),y(t)) = K(x,y) 
and w(x(t),y(t)) =w(x,y) 
for all (x,y) E V x V. 
If A E IR denotes the Lagrange multiplier of the critical point (a, b) E V xV, 
we have for the derivatives dK(a, b) = A dw(a, b) or explicitly 
(1. 73) 
q(a,x) 
q(y, b) 
dq(a)(x) 
dq(b)(y) 
AW(X, b) 
Aw(a,y) 
for every x, y E V. We have used the representation dq(x)(y) = q(x, y) of the 
derivative of q. In view of q(x) = H(x, x) one concludes from (1.73) that 2 = 
2(q(a) + q(b)) = 2A w(a, b). Since the maximum w(a, b) is positive, 
(1.74) 
1 
w(a, b) =:x > o. 
In particular, a, b are linearly independent in V since w is antisymmetric. As 
w( a, b) =I- 0 the 2-dimensional subspace VI = span {a, b} c V is symplectic. It is 
the eigenspace of Xq belonging to the pair ±iA of purely imaginary eigenvalues. 
Indeed, the equations (1.73) are equivalent to 
Xq(a) = +Ab and Xq(b) = -Aa 
so that Xq(a ± ib) = =r=(iA)(a ± ib). Normalizing, we introduce el = aa, It = -ab 
with a 2 = A and find w (It, et) = 1. Hence the pair el, It constitutes a symplectic 
basis of VI for which 
(1. 75) 
Recalling the identity q(x, y) = q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y) for x, y E V, we, therefore, 
have 
(1.76) 
if v = ~el + TJIt E VI, which is the desired normal form in VI. In order to iterate 
this argument we denote by 
the symplectic complement in V. Then VI~ is a symplectic subspace and 

38 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Indeed, VI n VI-L = {O} since w is nondegenerate on Vi; moreover v - w(v, eI)h + 
w(v, h)eI E vl for every v E V so that V = VI + vl. If v E VI and wE VI-L then 
w(v, w) = 0 and we claim that v and ware also orthogonal with respect to ij: 
ij(v,w) =0. 
This is true, since VI is an eigenspace. Indeed, by inserting x and y E VI-L into the 
equations (1.73), the right hand side vanishes, hence also the left hand side, and 
since VI = span {a, b}, the claim is proved. Equivalently we have 
(1.77) 
q( v + w) = q( v) + q( w) 
if v E Vi and w E V/. 
We can apply the same arguments as above to the restriction of q onto the sym-
plectic space V/. Iteratively we find a splitting V = VI EI1 V2 EI1 ... EI1 Vn into n 
distinguished 2-dimensional symplectic spaces Vj, which are the eigenspaces of Xq 
belonging to the pairs (=r=iAj) of eigenvalues, with Aj > O. In view of (1.77)

where M(q) = {(x, y) E V x V I q(x) + q(y) = I}. Since Q(x) ::; q(x) for all

{(x,y)IQ(x) + Q(y) = I} and w(aa,ab) = a2 w(a,b) 
> w(a, b). Taking the 
maximum of won M(Q), we conclude rn(Q) 2': rn(q). More generally, one verifies 
the estimates r j ( Q) 2': r j (q) for 1 ::; j ::; n readily, using the following minimax 
characterization of the critical levels: 
~rj(q)2 = min { max w},

WEFj 
WnM(q) 
where Pj denotes the family of all linear subspaces W c V x V of dimension 
2n + 2j and 1 ::; j ::; n. Indeed, recalling that wand K are, on the product 
space V x V, quadratic forms and that K is positive definite, this is simply the 
Courant-Hilbert minimax principle for the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix 
associated to the form w with respect to the inner product defined by the positive 
form K. We took, however, into account that the problem is invariant under the 
circle action defined above. In particular, if (a, b) E V x V is a critical point then 
( -b, a) is also a critical point on the same critical level. Hence each eigenvalue in 
the Courant-Hilbert principle has multiplicity at least 2. The general principle will 
give the positive characteristic levels C4n 2': C4n-l ... 2': C2n+l, and, in order to find 
all the positive critical levels, we have chosen above 
for 1 ::; j ::; n .• 
In order to interpret the above results geometrically, we associate with the form 
q E P the ellipsoid E(q), defined as the open set 
(1. 78) 
E(q) = {x I q(x) < I} C ]R2n. 
The group action of Sp(n) is then visualized by 
(1. 79) 
ip-l(E(q)) = E(q 0 ip). 
Observe that 
(1.80) 
E(q) c E(Q) {=} q 2': Q , 

40 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
so that E(q) = E(Q) if and only if q = Q. We can, therefore, associate with the 
open set E, the numbers r(E), defined by 
(1.81 ) 
r(E) = r(q) 
if E = E(q). 
In view of (1.79), we conclude from Proposition 7 that the numbers r are invariant 
under the group of linear symplectic mappings. Summarizing, we have proved: 
Proposition 9. If E, F are ellipsoids and r.p E Sp(n) then 
r (r.p(E)) = r(E). 
Conversely, if r(E) = r(F) then there exists a map r.p E Sp(n) satisfying r.p(E) = 
F .• 
The crucial observation now is that these invariants have a monotonicity prop-
erty. Indeed, in view of (1.80) the Proposition 8 can be restated as follows. 
Proposition 10. If E, F are ellipsoids, then 
EcF =} rj(E):::;rj(F) for l:::;j:::;n. 
Conversely, if rj(E) :::; rj(F) for 1 :::; j :::; n, then there exists a r.p E Sp(n) satisfying 
r.p(E) c F. 
Summarizing our considerations, we have defined for the open sets E of ellip-
soids in IR2n the invariants r(E) which allow us to answer the question of linear 
symplectic embeddings of ellipsoids as follows: 
Theorem 9. If E and F are two ellipsoids, then there exists r.p E Sp( n) such that 
r.p(E) c F 
if and only if rj(E) :::; rj(F) for alII:::; j :::; n .• 
We illustrate the statement with an example. If B = B(R) = {xl Ixl 2 < R2} 
is the open ball of radius R, then rj(B) = R for all 1 :::; j :::; n and we can find 
a map r.p E Sp( n) embedding B into the ellipsoid E if and only if E is restricted 
by the condition rl (E) ~ R. All this is, of course, not surprising. After all we 
consider only linear symplectic mappings and one might hope that the use of 
nonlinear symplectic embeddings is more flexible. It turns out, however, and this 
is a very surprising phenomenon discovered only recently, that if r.p : B(R) ----; E 
is any symplectic embedding then, rl (E) ~ R still. We shall prove this rigidity 
statement later on using a global symplectic invariant c(U) defined for every open 
set U C IR2n and satisfying c( r.p(U)) = c(U) for symplectic diffeomorphisms. This 
invariant extends rl so that c( E) = nrl (E)2 for ellipsoids E. It has, in addition, 
the monotonicity property in the sense that c(U) :::; c(V) provided there is a 
symplectic embedding r.p : U ----; V. 
Since the construction of this global invariant c will be related to special pe-
riodic solutions of Hamiltonian equations, it is useful to interpret the symplectic 

1.7 SYMPLECTIC CLASSIFICATION OF ... 
41 
invariants r(E) from a dynamical point of view. There is a relation between r(E) 
and certain closed characteristics on the boundary DE of E, which is the compact 
hypersurface 
DE = {z I q(z) = I}, if E = E(q). 
We may assume q to be in normal form 
Correspondingly, V splits into the 2-dimensional symplectic planes V = VI E8 V2 E8 
... E8 Vn and Zj = (Xj, Yj) E ffi.2 are the symplectic coordinates in Vj. The solutions 
z(t) = (ZI (t), ... , zn(t)) of the associated Hamiltonian vector field Xq are easily 
computed. Setting Aj = r22 , we have 
J 
where J is the standard 2 x 2 matrix of the symplectic structure. Consequently, 
DEnVj carries the distinguished periodic solution Wj(t) = (0, ... ,0, Zj(t), 0, ... ,0) 
given by 
Zj(t) = etAjJ Zj(O) and IZj(0)1 2 = r; 
and having period T = 7rr;. Its action, a global symplectic invariant, is 
T 
A(wj) = ~ j(-JWj,Wj) = 7rr;' 
o 
We see that the invariant rj of the set E is represented by a closed characteristic 
on DE. In particular, 
7rrl(E)2 = min { IA(z)l: Z is a closed characteristic on DE}. 
In the following, the dynamical approach will be extremely useful in the con-
struction of symplectic invariants. 
We would like to add that the quadratic forms play an important role if one 
studies the orbit structure of a Hamiltonian vector field XH locally near an equi-
librium point, i.e., a point at which X H vanishes. We shall finish this chapter by 
describing some well-known results illustrating this. We may assume the equilib-
rium to be the origin, so that \l H(O) = 0 and 
for Z near the origin in ffi.2n. From now on we shall assume the eigenvalues of 
J Hzz (0) to be purely imaginary, so that (±iAj) for 1 :::; j :::; n are all the eigenval-
ues. If one assumes, in addition, that JHzz(O) can be diagonalized symplectically 

42 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
one can write, after a linear symplectic transformation, 
with real numbers Aj ERIn view of Theorem 8, we can always achieve this nor-
mal form if Hzz(O) is positive definite. Now ]R2n is decomposed into the sum of 
symplectic 2-planes (Xj, Yj) which are filled with periodic solutions of the linear 
system i = JHzz(O)z having periods Itl. The question arises whether these fami-
lies have a continuation to solutions of the nonlinear system near z = O. The vector 
field X H may not admit any periodic solution except z = 0, as examples show. 
By restricting the Aj, a well-known result due to Lyapunov [145] guarantees a 
continuation under infinitely many nonresonance conditions. It is, therefore, quite 
remarkable that in the positive definite case studied above, no such conditions are 
needed, as the following result due to A. Weinstein [223] demonstrates: 
Theorem 10. Assume Hzz(O) > O. Then there are at least n closed characteristics on 
the hypersurfaces H(z) - H(O) = E2 for E > 0 sufficiently small. As parameterized 
solutions of the system X H , they have periods close to the ones of the linearized 
system i = JHzz(O)z. 
This local existence statement has been generalized by J. Moser [163]. The 
periodic solutions mentioned so far are prompted by the solutions of the linearized 
equation and we turn now to genuinely nonlinear phenomena. First we recall a 
nonlinear normal form of H at z = 0 which goes back to G. Birkhoff ([26] 1927), 
and which establishes nonlinear local symplectic invariants associated with H at 
the equilibrium point. 
1.8 The orbit structure near an equilibrium, Birkhoff normal form 
If H is a smooth function of the form 
near the equilibrium point z = 0, then we consider the group action HOT where T 
belongs to the group G 1 of symplectic and smooth diffeomorphisms defined locally 
near z = 0 and leaving the origin and the quadratic part H2 of H invariant, 
G 1 = {T I T*Wo = Wo 
and T(O) = 0, dT(O) = id}. 
The aim is to find a map T E G 1 such that HOT is in a particularly simple form. We 
emphasize that, in the following, the quadratic part H2 is fixed and not assumed 
to be a definite quadratic form.

Theorem 11. (Birkhoff normal form) Assume the linear invariants a = (aI, a2, 
... , an) are nonresonant of order s, i.e., 
(a,j) i- 0 
for 
j E Zn, 0 < Ijl :::::: s, 
n 
where Ijl = L: Ijvl· Then there exists an analytic map T E G l such that 
v=l 
HOT = F(h, ... , In) + Os, 
where F is a polynomial of degree [~J in the n variables I = (h, 12 , •.• , In) of 
the form 
1 
F = (a,1) + 2 ({3I,I) + ... , 
with a n x n matrix (3. The functions Ij on IR2n are given by

2 
Ij (x'Y)=2(Xj+Yj) 
for 
l::::::j::::::n. 
In addition, the polynomial F is uniquely determined by H and does not depend 
on the choice of T E G l . 
The coefficients of F are, therefore, local symplectic invariants of H called the 
Birkhoff invariants. Postponing the discussion about the significance of this normal 
form, we first give the proof, which is of an algebraic nature. 
Proof. We proceed iteratively and assume that 
H = H2 + H3 + ... + Hm- l + Hm + ... 
is already in normal form up to order m-l, where H j are homogeneous polynomials 
of degree j. We look for a symplectic map T E G l which does not change the normal 
form already achieved and which puts HOT into normal form up to order m. We 
take 
T = exp X p , 
i.e., the time-l map of the Hamiltonian vector field X p , with a homogeneous 
polynomial P of degree m. Since T belongs to the flow of a Hamiltonian vector 
field it is symplectic, and of the form 
T(Z) = Z + J\lP(z) + ... , 
where the dots stand for the higher order terms, and one computes readily 
HOT = H2 + H3 + ... + Hm- l + (Hm - {H2' P}) + .... 
The polynomial in the parenthesis is homogeneous of degree m and the bracket 
{-, .} stands for the Poisson bracket defined for two functions F and G as follows: 
{F, G} = w(Xa, X F ). 
We see that we can modify H by functions of the form {H2' Pl. 
Denote by Vm the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree m and 
let L: Vm ----+ Vm be the linear operator defined by L(P) = {H2 ,P} for P E Vm. 

44 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
Lemma 1. The kernel K = K (L) and the range R = R( L) of the linear operator 
L are complementary: 
Vm=K+R 
and 
KnR = {O}. 
If, in addition, (a,j) -=I 0 for 0 < iii :::::; m, then K = {O} if m is odd. If m = 2k is 
even, then 
n 
K = span {I~l ... I~n I L kj = k} . 
j=1 
The normal form, therefore, consists of elements in the kernel of L, and we 
shall abbreviate the set of normal forms by 
N = {P I {H2,P} = 0 and P is a polynomial}. 
Proof of the Lemma. In order to diagonalize L in Vm , we go to complex variables 
and choose the symplectic coordinates 
~v 
~ (xv + iyv) 
TJv 
~ (Yv + iXv) 
n 
so that ~vTJv = ~ (x~ + y~) and H2 = t L av(~vTJv). Consequently, 
v=1 
n 
We abbreviated (a, C - k) = L av(Cv - kv). If P E Vm then 
v=1 
P = L 
PkR~kTJR 
Ikl+IRI=m 
is decomposed into P = pK + pN, where pK E K (L) contains the coefficients PkR 
for (a, k - C) = 0 and pN the coefficients for (a, k - C) -=I O. In case of nonresonance 
of order m, we have (a, C - k) = 0 if and only if k = C. In this case K(L) consists 
of the monomials of the form ~kTJk = (~TJ)k which are, in the original coordinates, 
monomials of the form Ik = I~l ... I~n, as desired. This finishes the proof of the 
lemma .• 
In view of the lemma, it is easy to determine the desired map T. Splitting 
Hm = H!:; + H:" into H!:; E R(L) and H:" E K(L), so that 
Hm - {H2' P} = H;;; + H!:, - {H2' P}, 
we choose the polynomial P as a solution of {H2' P} - H!:; = O. The function 
HOT is now in normal form up to order m. Denoting the map just constructed by 

1.8 THE ORBIT STRUCTURE NEAR AN EQUILIBRIUM ... 
45 
7 = 7 m , we see that the desired map which puts H into normal form up to order 
s is iteratively found as a composition of mappings: 
7s 0 7s-1 0 ... 073 , 
where 7j E G1. It remains to prove the uniqueness of the normal form. This follows 
from the next lemma. 
Lemma 2. Assume that Ct is nonresonant of order s. If 71, 72 E G 1 satisfy

where P = P3 + ... + Ps is a polynomial of degree sand PEN. 
Proof. It clearly suffices to take H = F already in normal form, so that 
F 07 = F + as. 
We have to show that F = F and that 7 E G1 satisfies (ii). Proceeding again by 
induction, we assume that 
P = P3 + ... + P m-l + Pm + ... + Ps 
with Pj EN for 3::; j ::; m-l, and show that also Pm EN. In order to determine 
the terms of order m, we use the formula 
H 0 exp Xa = H + {H,G} + {{H,G},G} + ... 
for two functions H, G. This follows from the Taylor expansion of H 0 exp tXa 
in t at t = O. If now F = H2 + F3 + ... + Fs and similarly, F = H2 + F3 + ... + Fs 
we find 
where, by the induction assumption, Am is a sum of Poisson brackets of elements 
in N. Since N is a sub algebra we have Am eN, and therefore, 
In view of the previous lemma we conclude {H2' Pm} = 0 and hence Pm EN. 
The induction step is finished and we can, therefore, assume that PEN. The 
algebra N is abelian up to order s, since we assume the nonresonance condition

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
for a to hold up to order s. This follows from Lemma 1. Therefore, {F,P} = 0 so 
that 
F 0 T = F 0 exp Xp = F . 
Since F 0 T = F + Os we conclude F = F as claimed in the lemma. This finishes 
the proof of the lemma and hence that of Birkhoff's theorem .• 
From the dynamical point of view, the significance of Birkhoff's normal form 
lies in the fact that the symplectic transformation T makes the Hamiltonian system 
integrable in a small neighborhood of the equilibrium point, of course, only up to 
the terms Os of higher order. Indeed, dropping for the moment the higher order 
terms, the corresponding integrable system is defined by the Hamiltonian 
on R2n, which is a polynomial in the n functions Ij(x,y) = !(x; + y;). These 
functions are n integrals of F which are, in addition, in involution, i.e., {Ii, Ij } = o. 
The solutions of the Hamiltonian equations X F can, therefore, be given explicitly 
and for all times in terms of the integrals. Removing the coordinate axis from R2n 
and introducing the symplectic polar coordinates by 
v = 1,2, ... n, rv > 0 and {)v (mod 211"), then 
n 
n 
L dYj 1\ dXj = L d'!9j 1\ drj 
j=l 
j=l 
and the symplectic phase space becomes 
Since rv = Iv the transformed Hamiltonian is given by F(r1' r2, ... , rn) and does 
not depend on the angle variables {)1, ... , {)n. The flow c//(r) of the vector field 
trF(r) 
- t{}F(r) = 0 
can be read off immediately: 
The so-called frequency vector w is defined by 
a 
w = w(r) = or F(r) ERn. 

1.8 THE ORBIT STRUCTURE NEAR AN EQUILIBRIUM ... 
47 
The flow leaves every torus Tn X {r} C Tn X n invariant and, moreover, on the 
torus the flow is a linear Kronecker flow defined by the frequencies w(r). In contrast 
to the linear case these frequencies depend, in general, on the integrals r. This is 
the case, for example, if det /3 =1= 0 with /3 as defined in the normal form. In the 
original coordinates the solutions are quasi-periodic and represented by 
yv(t) + ixv(t) = J2rvei (D v +twv (r)) , 
where Yv(O) + ixv(O) = J2rveiDv . 
As a side remark we point out that if the Q-j are nonresonant of every order, 
i.e., rationally independent, then we find inductively by proceeding, as in the 
proof of the normal form, a symplectic map T in the form of a formal power series 
map, which puts the Hamiltonian H into the integrable form HOT = Poo(I). 
It is given in terms of a formal power series in the integrals 1 = (It, 12 , .•. 1 n) 
representing infinitely many symplectic invariants of H at O. This is a purely 
algebraic statement. If H is analytic and if T can be chosen to be convergent, then 
the Hamiltonian system can be solved explicitely near the equilibrium point. It 
is known, however, that divergence of T is the typical case. This was proved by 
C.L. Siegel 1954 [195]. At first sight it seems, therefore, that the normal forms are 
useless for the investigation of the orbit structure of a Hamiltonian system near the 
equilibrium point. This, however, is not the case. The normal form in Birkhoff's 
theorem can be used very effectively if one views X H as a perturbation of the 
integrable system XF near the equilibrium point. Indeed, perturbation methods 
allow us to continue some dynamical phenomena of the integrable system X F to 
the full system X H near the origin as we shall illustrate, although without giving 
a proof. 
Assume that a is nonresonant of order s = 4. In view of Birkhoff's theorem, 
we may assume after a nonlinear symplectic transformation T E G 1 , that the 
Hamiltonian is, near z = 0, of the form 
H(z) 
F(1) 
F(I) + 04(Z) 
1 
(a,1) + 2(/31,1) . 
Assuming the system XH to be nonlinear and nondegenerate, by requiring that 
det /3 =1= 0 
for the symplectic invariant /3, one verifies readily that every punctured neigh-
borhood 0 < Izl < c of the equilibrium point contains a periodic solution of the 
integrable system X F , so that z = 0 is a cluster point of periodic solutions of X F . 
The periods of these solutions tend to infinity. The same statement holds true also 
for the full system X H instead of X F , as was shown by G. Birkhoff and Lewis 
in 1933 [27]. For a proof we refer to J. Moser [164], who gave a proof of a more 
general result. 

48 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
If, in addition, X H is sufficiently smooth (e.g., if HE CR. for £ = 2n+3) then the 
celebrated K.A.M.-theory is applicable and allows a deeper insight into the orbit 
structure of X H near the equilibrium point. Although the integrability breaks 
down under the perturbation one can still conclude that many tori Tn X {r} with 
r small which are invariant under the integrable system X F , have a continuation 
as embedded Lagrangian tori Tr = cp(Tn x {r}) invariant under the flow X H . On 
the tori Tr the flow is the Kronecker flow given by iJ = w(r), so that Tr is covered 
by quasi-periodic solutions of X H having the frequencies w(r). In addition, these 
invariant tori fill out a Cantor set in the phase space of relatively large Lebesgue 
measure. 
The proofs are analytical in nature and very subtle due to the difficulty of 
small denominators. This difficulty was overcome in the sixties by Kolmogorov 
[128], Arnold [7, 8], and Moser [159]. For a recent presentation and for references 
we refer to J. P6schel [178]; see also [189]. 
It turns out that the invariant tori constructed by the K.A.M. theory lie in the 
closure of the set of periodic orbits. This observation leads to the following local 
existence statement for periodic orbits near an equilibrium point, a proof of which 
can be found in [56]. 
Theorem 12. Assume H E CR. for £ 2': 2n+3 and satisfies the nonresonance condition 
for a of order s = 4. Assume the system is nonlinear requiring det (3 -=I=- O. If BE 
denotes the closure of the set of periodic solutions contained in the open ball B(c) 
of radius c centered at the equilibrium point, then 
where m denotes the Lebesque measure. 
These periodic solutions, as well as the quasi-periodic solutions near the equi-
libdum point, are established supposing only finitely many inequalities for finitely 
many local symplectic invariants of H at z = O. Higher order resonances of the lin-
ear invariants play no role because of the postulated nonlinarity. This is a typical 
phenomenon in Hamiltonian mechanics. On the other hand, it should be recalled 
that the analytical methods applied require a lot of derivatives for the system. 
The orbits near the equilibrium point described so far are concluded by means 
of perturbation methods from corresponding orbits of the integrable part of the 
Birkhoff normal form. There exist, in general, other orbits of very different nature 
which are not compatible with the integrable part and whose existence explain the 
divergence of the normal form. This is best illustrated by the celebrated sketch due 
to V. Arnold and A. Avez in their book [12], 1968. It demonstrates the complexity 
of the orbit structure of a nonlinear symplectic map cp near a stable fixed point in 
the plane ]R2. Such a map arises, for example, as a transversal section map of a 
Hamiltonian system on a three-dimensional energy surface near a stable periodic 
orbit. Instead of studying nearby orbits for all times, one can just as well study 
the iterates of its section map. 

1.8 THE ORBIT STRUCTURE NEAR AN EQUILIBRIUM ... 
49 
The fixed point 0 in the middle is surrounded by smooth curves close to circles 
which are invariant under the map cp. They were discovered by J. Moser 1962 
[159]. These curves fill out a Cantor set of relatively large measure, reflecting the 
integrable approximation of the map near the fixed point. Between these curves 
one discovers generically orbits of elliptic and hyperbolic periodic points. Moreover, 
the stable and unstable invariant manifolds issuing from the hyperbolic periodic 
points do intersect transversally in so-called homo clinic points. It is well-known 
that these points complicate the orbit structure of cp considerably and destroy the 
integrable pattern. They give, in particular, rise to invariant hyperbolic sets on 
which the iterates of the map can be described statistically by means of topological 
Bernoulli shifts. One can even show that the elliptic fixed point is a cluster point 
of such homo clinic points. In addition, this picture is repeated near the elliptic 
periodic orbits for the higher iterates of the map and so on. The dotted lines in 
the picture indicate the recently discovered Mather sets, for which we refer to 
J. Mather [151]. The generic existence of the homoclinic orbits in the picture was 
established by E. Zehnder in [230], 1973. For an improved and modern version we 
point out C. Genecand [104], 1991; further references are A. Chenciner [49] and J. 
Moser [162].

The above picture illustrates the complexity of the orbit structure of Hamil-
tonian systems and shows, in particular, that orbits of very different longtime 
behaviour do, in general, coexist side by side. This phenomenon makes the inves-
tigation of the long time behaviour by means of solving the Cauchy initial value 
problem a hopeless task. In contrast, the existence question for periodic solutions 
with which we shall deal later on, leads to a boundary value problem distinguished 
by a variational principle. 

50 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
The local existence results described above are of analytical nature. In con-
trast, the aim in Chapter 4 is to find global periodic solutions. Similarly as in the 
situation near an equilibrium point, the orbit structure near a periodic solution 
can also be studied by means of a BirkhofI normal form. This normal form repre-
sents an integrable approximation of the system locally near the periodic solution 
where the linear invariants are now the Floquet multipliers of the periodic orbit. 
We should mention that although the qualitative methods employed in finding 
these global periodic solutions are powerful, they are not sufficient to gain infor-
mation about the BirkhofI invariants of these periodic solutions. Nevertheless, it 
is important to keep in mind that a single periodic orbit of a Hamiltonian system 
carries potential information about a nearby very rich orbit structure including 
many other periodic orbits having larger periods, quasi-periodic solutions and also 
hyperbolic phenomena. 

Chapter 2 
Symplectic capacities 
2.1 
Definition and application to embeddings 
In the following we introduce a special class of symplectic invariants discovered by 
1. Ekeland and H. Hofer in [68, 69] for subsets of JR2n. They were led to these in-
variants in their search for periodic solutions on convex energy surfaces and called 
them symplectic capacities. The concept of a symplectic capacity was extended to 
general symplectic manifolds by H. Hofer and E. Zehnder in [123]. The existence 
proof of these invariants is based on a variational principle; it is not intuitive, 
and will be postponed to the next chapter. Taking their existence for granted, the 
aim of this chapter is rather to deduce the rigidity of some symplectic embed-
dings and, in addition, the rigidity of the symplectic nature of mappings under 
limits in the supremum norm, which will give rise to the notion of a "symplectic 
homeomorphism" . 
Definition of symplectic capacity. We consider the class of all symplectic manifolds 
(M,w) possibly with boundary and of fixed dimension 2n. A symplectic capacity is 
a map (M,w) ~ c(M,w) which associates with every symplectic manifold (M,w) 
a nonnegative number or 00, satisfying the following properties A1-A3. 
AI. Monotonicity: 
c( M, w) :::; c( N, T) 
ifthere exists a symplectic embedding '-P : (M, w) ~ (N, T). 
A2. Conformality: 
c(M,aw) = lalc(M,w) 
for all a E JR, a =I=- o. 
A3. Nontriviality: 
c(B(l),wo) = IT = c(Z(l),wo) 
for the open unit ball B(l) and the open symplectic cylinder Z(l) in the standard 
space (JR2n , wo). For convenience, we recall that with the symplectic coordinates 
(x,y) E JR2n, 
B(r) = {(x, y) E JR2n IIxl2 + lyl2 < r2} 
and 
Z(r) = {(x, y) E JR2n I xi + yi < r2} 
for r > O. It is often convenient to replace (A3) by the following weaker axiom 
(A3'): 
A3'. Weak nontriviality: 
0< c(B(l),wo) and c(Z(l),wo) < 00. 
It should be pointed out that the axioms (A1)-(A3) do not determine a unique 
capacity function. There are indeed many ways to construct capacity functions as 
51 

52 
CHAPTER 2 SYMPLECTIC CAPACITIES 
we shall see later on. We first illustrate the concept and deduce some simple conse-
quences of the axioms (A1)-(A3). In the special case of 2-dimensional symplectic 
manifolds, n = 1, the modulus of the total area 
c(M,w) := I J 
w I 
M 
is an example of a symplectic capacity function. It agrees with the Lebesgue mea-
sure in (]R2, wo). In contrast, if n > 1, then the symplectic invariant (vol ) ~ is ex-
cluded by axiom (A3), since the cylinder has infinite volume. If 'P : (M, w) ----> (N, CT) 
is a symplectic diffeomorphism between the two manifolds M and N, one applies 
the monotonicity axiom to 'P and 'P- 1 and concludes 
c(M,w) = C(N,CT). 
Therefore, the capacity is indeed a symplectic invariant. Observe also that, by 
means of the inclusion mapping, we have for open subsets of (M,w) the mono-
tonicity property 
U c V 
===} c(U):::; c(v). 
In order to describe some simple examples in (]R2n, wo) we start with 
Lemma 1. For U C (]R2n,wo) open and), -=I 0, 
Proof. This is a consequence of the conformality axiom. The diffeomorphism 
1 
'P : )'U ----> U, 
X t---t :x-x 
satisfies 'P*().2wo) = ).2'P*WO = wo0 Therefore, 'P: ().U,wo) ----> (U,).2wo) is symplec-
tic, so that c().U, wo) = c(U, ).2wo) = ).2C(U, wo) as claimed .• 
For the open ball of radius r > 0 in ]R2n we find, in particular 
(2.1) 
Since B(r) c B(r) c B(r + E) for every 10 > 0 we conclude by monotonicity that 
c(B(r)) = 7fr2. We see that in the special case of (]R2,wo) 
agrees with the Lebesgue measure of the disc. This can be used to show that the 
capacity agrees with the Lebesgue measure for a large class of sets in ]R2, as has 
been observed by K.F. Siburg [194J. 

2.1 DEFINITION AND APPLICATION TO EMBED DINGS 
53 
Proposition 1. If D C ]R2 is a compact and connected domain with smooth bound-
ary, then 
c(D,wo) = area (D). 
Proof. By removing finitely many compact curves from D, we find a simply con-
nected domain Do C D satisfying m(Do) = m(D), which in view of the uni-
formization theorem is diffeomorphic to the unit disc B(l) C ]R2. Therefore, there 
exists a p > 0 and a diffeomorphism cp : B(p) -t Do satisfying, in addition, 
m(B(p)) = m(Do). Given c > 0 we find r < p such that Dl := cp(B(r)) C Do sat-
isfies m(Dd 2: m(D) - c. By the theorem of Dacorogna-Moser there is, therefore, 
a measure preserving diffeomorphism 'l/J : B(r) -t D 1 . Since this 'l/J is symplectic 
we can estimate using the monotonicity, the invariance under symplectic diffeo-
morphisms and the normalization 
On the other hand, there exists a diffeomorphism cp : D -t B(R)\{ finitely many 
open discs of total measure ::; c}. Choosing R appropriately we can assume, again 
by Dacorogna and Moser's theorem, that cp is symplectic so that 
To sum up: m(D) - c ::; c(D) ::; m(D) +c for every c > 0 and the result follows .• 
Clearly, 
0< c(U) < 00 
for every open and bounded set in (]R 2n , wo), since U contains a small ball and is 
contained in a large ball. A similar argument as for B (r) above shows for symplectic 
cylinders that 
(2.2) 
Therefore, if an open set U satisfies 
B(r) cUe Z(r) 
for some r > 0, we find by the monotonicity that 7rr2 
c(Z(r)) = 7rr2 and hence 
c(U) = 7rr2. 
(Fig. 2.1) 
c(B(r)) < c(U) < 
This demonstrates that very different (in shape, size, measure and topology) 
open sets can have the same capacity, if n > 1. Recall that the ellipsoids E C ]R2n 
introduced in the previous chapter are characterized by the (linear) symplectic 

54 
CHAPTER 2 SYMPLECTIC CAPACITIES 
Fig. 2.1 
invariants rl(E) :::; r2(E) :::; ... :::; rn(E). Applying a linear symplectic map which 
preserves the capacities we may assume, in view of Theorem 9 of Chapter 1, that 
where rl = rl (E). We conclude that the capacity of an ellipsoid E is then deter-
mined by the smallest linear symplectic invariant rl (E). 
Proposition 2. The capacity of an ellipsoid E in (]R.2n, wo) is given by 
c(E) = 7lTI (E)2 
We see that every capacity c extends the smallest linear invariants 7frl (E)2 
of ellipsoids E and the question arises, whether the linear invariants 7frj(E)2 for 
j > 1 also have extensions to invariants in the nonlinear case. We shall come back 
to this question later on. Symplectic cylinders are "based" on symplectic 2-planes. 
They are very different from cylinders "based" on isotropic 2-planes on which the 
2-form Wo vanishes, as for example ZI(r) = {(x, y) E ]R.2n I x~ + x~ < r2}. We 
claim that 
c(ZI(r)) = +00, for all r > o. 
This is easily seen as follows. For every ball B(N) there is a linear symplectic 
embedding cp : B(N) -+ ZI(r). Therefore, 7fN2 = c(B(N)) :::; c(ZI(r)). This holds 
true for every N and the claim follows. 
In order to generalize this example we recall some definitions. If V C ]R.2n is a 
linear subspace, its symplectic complement V.1 is defined by 
V.1 = {x E ]R.2n I Wo (v,x) = 0 for all v E V}. 
Clearly (V.1).1 = V and dim V.1 = dim ]R.2n - dim V, since Wo is nondegenerate. 
A linear subspace V is called isotropic if V c V.1, that is w ( Vb V2) = 0 for all VI 
and V2 E V. 
Proposition 3. Assume 0 C ]R.2n is an open bounded nonempty set and assume 
W C ]R.2n is a linear subspace with codim W = 2. Consider the cylinder 0 + W, 
then 
c( 0 + W) = +00 if W.1 is isotropic 
0< c(O + W) < 00 if W.1 is not isotropic. 

2.1 DEFINITION AND APPLICATION TO EMBEDDINGS 
55 
Proof. We may assume that 0 contains the origin. Observe that dim W -L = 2. 
Therefore, in the second case, W -L is a symplectic subspace and JR.2n = W -L EB W. 
Choosing a symplectic basis (el,Jd in W -L we can, therefore, assume by a linear 
symplectic change of coordinates that 
Since 0 is bounded, we have for z E 0 + W, that xi + yi < N 2 for some N; 
consequently O+W C B2(N) xJR.2n-2, and hence c(O+W) :s:: C(B2(N) xJR.2n-2) = 
7fN2 < 00 by (2.2). This proves the second statement. To prove the first statement 
we can assume that 
W={(x,y)1 Xl =X2=0}. 
There exists 0: > 0, so that the point (x, y) EO + W if xi + x~ < 0:2 . Hence every 
ball B(R) can be symplectically embedded in 0 + W: simply define the linear 
symplectic map 'P by 'P(x, y) = (EX, ~y); then 'P(B(R)) C 0 + W provided E > 0 
is sufficiently small. Consequently, by the monotonicity of a capacity, c(O x W) ~ 
c(B(R)) = 7fR2. This holds true for every R > 0 so that c(O + W) = +00 as 
claimed .• 
In view of the monotonicity property, the symplectic invariants c( M, w) repre-
sent, in particular, obstructions of symplectic embeddings. An immediate conse-
quence of the axioms is the celebrated squeezing theorem of Gromov [107] which 
gave rise to the concept of a capacity. 
Theorem 1. (Gromov's squeezing theorem) There is a symplectic embedding 'P : 
B(r) ----> Z(R) if and only if R ~ r .. 
Proof. If 'P is a symplectic embedding, then using the monotonicity property of 
the capacity, together with (2.1) and (2.2), we have 
7fr2 = c(B(r)) :s:: c(Z(R)) = 7fR2, 
and the theorem follows .• 
The next result also illustrates the difference between volume preserving and 
symplectic diffeomorphisms. We consider in (JR.4 , wo) with symplectic coordinates 
(Xl,Yl,X2,Y2) the product of symplectic open 2-balls B(rl) x B(r2). By a linear 
symplectic map we can assume that rl :s:: r2. 
Proposition 4. There is a symplectic diffeomorphism 'P : B(rl) x B(r2) ----> B(sd x 
B(S2) if and only if rl = Sl and r2 = S2. 
Note that, in contrast, there is a linear volume preserving diffeomorphism 'l/J : 
B(l) x B(l) ----> B(r) x B(~) for every r > o. As r ----> 0, we evidently have 
----> 
0 
const.

CHAPTER 2 SYMPLECTIC CAPACITIES 
Proof. Since rl ::; r2 we can use the diffeomorphism 'P to define the symplectic 
embedding B4(rd ---- B(rd x B(r2) ~ B(81) x B(82) ---- B(8d x ]R2 = Z(8d, 
where the first and last mappings are the inclusion mappings. By the monotonicity 
of c, we conclude 81 2: rl. Applying the same argument to 'P-l, we find rl 2: 81, 
so that rl = 81. Now 'P is volume preserving; hence rlr2 = 8182 and the result 
follows .• 
Clearly, if one assumes that 'P is smooth up to the boundary, then the conditions 
on the radii follow simply from the invariance of the actions IA(8B(rj))1 = 7rr; 
under symplectic diffeomorphism. One might expect the same rigidity as in Propo-
sition 4 to hold also in the general case of a product of n open symplectic 2-balls in 
]R2n. This is indeed the case, but does not follow from the capacity function c alone. 
Actually, the proof given in [52] is rather subtle and uses the symplectic homology 
theory, as developed by A. Floer and H. Hofer in [90], see also K. Cieliebak, A. 
Floer, H. Hofer and K. Wysocki [52]. Finally the restrictions for symplectic em-
beddings of ellipsoids mentioned in the previous chapter follow immediately from 
Proposition 2. 
Proposition 5. Assume E and F are two ellipsoids in (]R2n, wo). If 'P : E ---- F is a 
symplectic embedding, then 
The existence of one capacity function permits the construction of many other 
capacity functions. 
As an illustration we shall prove that the Gromov-width D(M,w) which ap-
pears in Gromov's work [107] and which was explained in the introduction is a 
symplectic capacity satisfying (AI)-(A3). Recall that there is always a symplectic 
embedding 'P: (B(s),wo) ---- (M,w) for s small by Darboux's theorem and define 
{

D(M,w)=sup 7rr

Theorem 2. The Gromov-width D(M,w) is a symplectic capacity. Moreover 
D(M,w) ::; c(M,w) 
for every capacity function c. 
Because a compact symplectic manifold (M, w) has a finite volume we conclude 
D( M, w) < 00 for compact manifolds. This is in contrast to the special capacity 
function Co constructed in the next chapter which can take on the value 00 for 
certain compact manifolds. 
Proof. We have already verified the monotonicity axiom (AI) in the introduction. 
In order to verify the con formality axiom (A2), that D(M, aw) = laID(M, w) for 
a #- 0, it is sufficient to show that to every symplectic embedding 
'P: (B(r),wo) ---- (M,aw), 

2.1 DEFINITION AND APPLICATION TO EMBED DINGS 
57 
there corresponds a symplectic embedding 
cP : (B(vTar)'WO) --+ (M,w), 
and conversely, so that by definition of D, we conclude that D(M,o:w) = 
lo:ID(M,w). If 'P : (B(r),wo) 
--+ (M,o:w) is a symplectic embedding, then 
'P*(o:w) = Wo so that 
* 
1 
'P w = - woo 
0: 
Abbreviating p = ~ we define the diffeomorphism 'Ij; : B(p) --+ B(r) by setting 
vial 
'Ij;(x) = M· X and find 
'Ij;* (~ wo)= 1:1 wo0 
Thus, if 0: > 0, the map cp = 'P 0 'Ij; : (B(p),wo) --+ (M,w) is the desired sym-
plectic embedding. If 0: < 0 we first introduce the symplectic diffeomorphism 
'lj;o : (B(p),wo) --+ (B(p),-wo) by setting 'lj;o(u,v) = (-u,v) for all (u,v) E ]R2n, 
and find the desired embedding cp = 'P0'lj; o'lj;o: (B(p),wo)--+ (M,w). 
The verification of D(B(r),wo) = 7fr2 is easy. If 'P : B(R) --+ B(r) is a symplec-
tic embedding, we conclude R ::::; r since 'P is volume preserving. On the other hand 
the identity map induces a symplectic embedding B(r) --+ B(r) so that the claim 
follows. Since there exists a symplectic embedding 'P : B(R) --+ Z(r) if and only 
if r 2: R by Gromov's squeezing theorem, we conclude that D(Z(r),wo) = 7fr2, 
hence the Gromov-width satisfies also the nontriviality axiom (A3). In order to 
prove the last statement of the theorem, we assume c( M, w) to be any capacity. 
If <p : B(r) ---> M is a symplectic embedding we conclude by monotonicity that 
7fr2 = c(B(r),wo) ::::; c(M,w). Taking the supremum, we find D(M,w) ::::; c(M,w) 
as claimed in the theorem .• 
To a given capacity c one can associate its inner capacity 15, defined as follows: 
c(M,w) = sup {c(U,w) 1 U c M open and U c M\8M} 
Correspondingly, we introduce the following 
Definition. A capacity c has inner regularity at M if 
c(M,w) = c(M,w). 
Proposition 6. The function 15 is a capacity having inner regularity and it satisfies 
15 ::::; C. In addition, if d is any capacity having inner regularity and satisfying d ::::; c, 
then d::::; C. 

58 
CHAPTER 2 SYMPLECTIC CAPACITIES 
Proof. The proof follows readily from the definitions and the axioms for capacity. 
Assume, for example, that d is a symplectic capacity satisfying d :::; c and having 
inner regularity. 
Then 
d(M) 
sup {d(U)1 U c M, U c M\8M} 
< 
sup {c(U)1 U c M,U c M\8M} 
c(M) , 
as claimed .• 
Because it is the smallest capacity, the Gromov-width D(M,w) has inner reg-
ularity; another example having this property is the capacity Co introduced in 
Chapter 3. If we consider subsets of a given manifold we can also define the con-
cept of outer regularity (relative to the manifold). The outer capacity of a set is 
defined as the infimum taken over the capacities of open neighborhoods of the 
closure of the given set. We shall return to this concept in the next section. 
2.2 Rigidity of symplectic diffeomorphisms 
We consider a sequence 1f;j :]R2n -t]R2n of symplectic diffeomorphisms in (]R2n ,wo). 
By definition, the first derivatives satisfy the identity 
1f;j(xf J 1f;j(x) = J, 
x E ]R2n. 
Therefore, if the sequence 1f;j converges in e 1 then the limit 1f;(x) = lim1f;j(x) is 
also a symplectic map. By contrast, we shall now assume that the sequence 1f;j 
only converges locally uniformly to a map 
which is, therefore, a continuous map. Since det1f;j(x) = 1 for every x, we find, in 
view of the transformation formula for integrals, that 
(2.3) 
for all f E ego (]R2n) , so that 1f; is measure preserving. Assume now that 1f; is 
differentiable, then evidently det1f;'(x) = ±l. However it is a striking phenomenon 
that 1f; is even symplectic, 
1f;'(X)T J1f;'(x) = J, 
if it is assumed to be differentiable. Hence the symplectic nature survives under 
topological limits. 

2.2 RIGIDITY OF SYMPLECTIC DIFFEOMORPHISMS 
59 
Theorem 3. Let 'Pj : B(l) ---+ (]R2n, wo) be a sequence of symplectic embeddings 
converging locally uniformly to a map 'P : B(l) ---+ ]R2n. If 'P is differentiable at 
x = 0, then 'P'(O) = A is a symplectic map, i.e., A*wo = WOo 
We see that, in general, a volume preserving diffeomorphism cannot be ap-
proximated by symplectic diffeomorphisms in the CD-topology. By using, locally, 
Darboux charts we deduce immediately from Theorem 3 
Theorem 4. (Eliashberg, Gromov) The group of symplectic diffeomorphisms of a 
compact symplectic manifold (M,w) is CD-closed in the group of all diffeomor-
phisms of M. 
In the early seventies M. Gromov proved the alternative that the group of sym-
plectic diffeomorphisms either is CD-closed in the group of all diffeomorphisms or 
its CO-closure is the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. That symplec-
tic diffeomorphisms can be distinguished from volume preserving diffeomorphisms 
by global properties which are stable under CD-limits was announced in the early 
eighties by Y. Eliashberg in his preprint "Rigidity of symplectic and contact struc-
ture", (1981) [78], which in full form has not been published. Proofs are partially 
contained in Eliashberg [71], 1987. Gromov gave a proof of Theorem 4 in [107] 
using the techniques of pseudoholomorphic curves. Both Eliashberg und Gromov 
deduced the CO-stability from non embedding results. In his book [108] Gromov 
uses so-called Nash-Moser techniques of hard implicit function theorems, while 
Eliashberg [71], 1987, uses an analogue of Theorem 3. Following the strategy of 
1. Ekeland and H. Hofer in [68], we shall show next, that Theorem 3 is an easy 
consequence of the existence of any capacity function c. 
It is convenient in the following to extend the capacity to all subsets of ]R2n. 
To do so we take a capacity function c given on the open subsets U C ]R2n and 
define for an arbitrary subset A C ]R2n: 
c(A) = inf {c(U)IA c U and U open}. 
Then the monotonicity property 
A c B 
===} c(A) ~ c(B) 
holds true for all subsets of ]R2n. From the symplectic invariance of the capacity 
on open sets, one deduces the invariance 
c('P(A)) = c(A) 
under every symplectic embedding 'P defined on an open neighborhood of A. 
Proof of Theorem 3. Without loss of generality we shall assume in the following 
that 'P(O) = O. We first claim that the linear map 'P'(O) = A is an isomorphism. 
Indeed, because 'P is differentiable at 0, we have 'P(x) = Ax + O(lxl), so that for 
the open balls BE of radius c > 0 and centered at 0, 

60 
CHAPTER 2 SYMPLECTIC CAPACITIES 
On the other hand, because the symplectic diffeomorphisms rpj are volume preserv-
ing and rpj ---> rp uniformly, we have m(rp(Bc)) = m(Bc) and hence I det AI = 1, so 
that A is an isomorphism, as claimed. We shall see later on (Lemma 3) that A is an 
isomorphism under weaker assumption: instead of requiring rpj to be symplectic, 
we shall merely require these mappings to preserve a given capacity function. 
Next we claim that to prove Theorem 3, it is sufficient to show that 
(2.4) 
A*wo = AWo for some A "I=- o. 
Indeed, with rpj we can also consider the symplectic embeddings (rpj, id) : B(1) X 
]R2n ---> (]R2n X ]R2n, Wo EB wo) and hence conclude for the derivative at (0,0), given 
by A = (A, 1), that also A*(wo EB wo) = p,(wo EB wo) for some p, "I=- O. On the other 
hand, in view of (2.4), A*(wo EB wo) = (Awo) EB Wo and consequently p, = 1 = A, as 
required in Theorem 4, proving our claim. In order to prove (2.4) we make use of 
the following algebraic lemma due to Y. Eliashberg [71]. 
Lemma 2. Assume A is a linear isomorphism satisfying A*wo "I=- Awo. Then for 
every a > 0 there are symplectic matrices U and V such that U-1 AV has the 
form 
with respect to the splitting of ]R2n = ]R2 EB ]R2n-2 into symplectic subspaces. 
Postponing the proof of the lemma, we first show that A * Wo = AWo for some A "I=-
O. Arguing by contradiction, we assume that A*wo "I=- AWo and apply the lemma. 
Defining the symplectic maps 'ljJj := U-1rpj V in the neighborhood of the origin, 
we conclude that 'ljJj ---> 'ljJ := U-1rpV locally uniformly, and 'ljJ'(O) = U-1AV. 
Choosing a suitable constant a in the lemma, we have U-1AV(B(1)) C Z(~) and 
hence U-1'ljJV(B(c:)) c Z(~) provided c: is sufficiently small. Because 'ljJj ---> 'ljJ 
locally uniformly, U-1'ljJj V (B( c:)) C Z( ~) if j is sufficiently large and c: sufficiently 
small. Since U-1'ljJj V is symplectic, we conclude by the invariance and monotonic-
ity property of a capacity that c(U-1'ljJj V(B(c:))) = c(B(c:)) ~ c(Z(~)), which 
contradicts the nontriviality Axiom (A3). We have proved the statement in (2.4) 
and it remains to prove Lemma 2. 
Proof of Lemma 2. Let B be the symplectic adjoint of A satisfying 
wo(Ax, y) = wo(x, By) 
for all x, y, and abbreviate w = B*wo. Then w "I=- AWo, as is easily verified using 
the fact that A is an isomorphism. We claim that there is an x such that w( x, .) "I=-
AWo (x, .) for every A. Arguing by contradiction, we assume that for every x, there 
exists a A(x) E ]R satisfying w(x,·) = A(x)wo(x, .). If x "I=- 0 there exists ~ such 

2.2 RIGIDITY OF SYMPLECTIC DIFFEOMORPHISMS 
61 
that Wo (~, x) =f. 0, since Wo is nondegenerate. This remains true for all y in a 
neighborhood U(x) of x. Hence 
.A(~)wo(~,y) 
w(~,y) = -w(y,~) 
-.A(y)wo(y, ~) 
.A(y)wo(~, y), 
which implies that .A(~) = .A(y) for y in a neighborhood of x. Since ]R.2n\{0} is 
connected and since the function .A(x) on ]R.2n\{0} is locally constant, it is constant. 
Therefore w (x, .) = .AWo (x, .) for x =f. 0 and hence for every x. This contradicts the 
assumption that w =f. .AWo and proves our claim. Consequently there exists an x 
such that the linear map (wo(x, ·),w(x, .)) : ]R.2n -+ ]R.2 is surjective. For a given 
a > 0, we therefore find an y satisfying 
wo(x,y) = 1 and w(x,y) = a2 • 
Recalling w(x, y) = wo(Bx, By), we can choose two symplectic bases (el' h, ... ) 
and (ei, fL .. ·) such that el = x, h = y and ei = ~Bx,Jf = ~By. In these bases 
Bel=ae~, Bh=af{. 
From (JAx,y) = (Jx,By) = (BT Jx,y) we read off A = -JBT J. Representing 
now A in the new bases as a map from ]R.2n with basis (eb h, ... ) onto ]R.2n with 
basis (ei, If, ... ), we find the representation U- l AV of the desired form. The 
symplectic matrices are defined by their column vectors as U = reb h, ... ] and 
V = [ei,JL ... ] .• 
We know that symplectic diffeomorphisms preserve the capacities. Theorem 3 
can, therefore, be deduced from the following, even more surprising statement for 
continuous mappings due to 1. Ekeland and H. Hofer [68]. 
Theorem s. Let c be a capacity. Assume'ljJj : B(1) -+ ]R.2n is a sequence of contin-
uous mappings satisfying 
c('ljJj(E)) = c(E) 
for all (small) ellipsoids E C B(1) and converging locally uniformly to 
If'ljJ is differentiable at 0, then 'ljJ'(O) = A is either symplectic or antisymplectic: 
A*wo = Wo or A*wo = -woo 
Note that the mappings are not required to be invertible. 
In order to prove Theorem 5, we start with 

62 
CHAPTER 2 SYMPLECTIC CAPACITIES 
Lemma 3. Let C be a capacity. Consider a sequence CPj of continuous mappings in 
]R2n converging locally uniformly to the map cpo Assume that c(cpj(E)) = c(E) for 
the open ellipsoids for all j. If cp'(O) exists it is an isomorphism. 
Proof. Arguing by contradiction, we assume that A is not surjective, so that A(]R2n) 
is contained in a hyperplane H. Composing, if necessary, with a linear symplectic 
map we may assume that 
(2.5) 
A(]R2n) C H = {(x, y)1 Xl = O} . 
Defining the linear symplectic map '¢ by 
we can choose a > 0 so small that 
where the open 2-disc B2 on the right hand side is contained in the symplectic 
plane with the coordinates {Xl, Yl}. Be definition of a derivative, we have I,¢cp(x)-
'¢A(x) I :S a(lxl) Ixl where a(s) --+ 0 as s --+ O. Consequently 
if c is sufficiently small. Since '¢CPj converges locally uniformly to '¢cP, 
provided j is sufficiently large. By assumption '¢CPj preserves the capacity and so 
by monotonicity 
This contradiction shows that A is surjective .• 
Proof of Theorem 5. We may assume that '¢(O) = O. By Lemma 3, A = '¢'(O) is an 
isomorphism and we shall prove first that A*wo = AWo for some A =I- O. Arguing 
by contradiction, we assume A*wo =I- AWo and find (by Lemma 2) symplectic maps 
U and V satisfying U- l AV(B(l)) c Z(l). Proceeding now as in Theorem 4, we 
define the sequence CPj := U-l'¢j V. Then CPj --+ cP := U-l'¢V locally uniformly, 
and cp'(O) = U- l AV. Hence cp(B(c)) C Z(~) and consequently cpj(B(c)) C Z(~) 
for j sufficiently large and c > 0 sufficiently small. Since, by assumption on '¢j, 
we have c(cpj(B(c))) = c(B(c)), we infer by the monotonicity of a capacity that 
c(B(c)) :S c(Z(~)), contradicting Axiom (A3) for a capacity. 

2.2 RIGIDITY OF SYMPLECTIC DIFFEOMORPHISMS 
63 
We have demonstrated that A*wo = AWo. By conformality a linear antisymplec-
tic map preserves the capacities. Composing the maps 'lj;j and 'lj; with the symplec-
tic map B = (JxA) -1 if A> 0 and with the antisymplectic map B = (kA)-l 
if A < 0, we are therefore reduced to the case 
A = a 1, with a> 0 
and we have to show that a = 1. If a < 1 there is a small ball and an a < r < 1 
such that 'lj;j(B(c:)) C B(rc:) for j large. Since'lj;j preserves the capacities we find 
c(B(c)) = c('lj;j(B(c:)) ::; c(B(rc:)) = r 2c(B(c:)) which is a contradiction. In the 
case a > 1 we shall show that 
(2.6) 
'lj;j (B(c:)) :J B(rc:) 
for some a > r > 1, c: small and j large, which leads to the contradiction 
r 2c(B(c:)) = c(B(rc)) ::; c(B(c:)). Consequently, a = 1 as claimed in the theo-
rem. 
To prove (2.6) we have to show that for every y E B(rc:) there exists an 
x E B(c:) solving 'lj;j(x) = y. We use an index argument based on the Brouwer 
mapping degree. Fix 1 < r < a. Then, in view of A(B(c:)) = B(ac:), 
deg(B(c:) , A, y) = 1, 
for y E B(rc), and the proof follows if we can show that 
deg(B(c:), 'lj;j, y) = deg(B(c:), A, y). 
In view of the homotopy invariance of the degree, it is sufficient to verify that 
the homotopy h(t,x) = t'lj;j(x) + (1 - t)Ax satisfies h(t,x) of y if x E 8B(c:) and 
o ::; t ::; 1. 
Recall 'lj;(0) = 0 and hence I'lj;(x) - Axl ::; a(lxl)lxl, with a(s) ---> 0 as s ---> O. 
Since'lj;j ---> 'lj; uniformly on compact sets we have, for every u > 0 and j ~ jo(u) 
(2.7) 
Arguing by contradiction, we assume t'lj;j(x) + (1 - t)Ax = y for x E oB(c:) and 
y E B(rc:). Then 
t('lj;j(x) - Ax) = y - Ax. 
The right hand side is larger than IAxl- Iyl = ac: -IYI ~ (a - r)c:. The left hand 
side, however is smaller than a(Ic:I)c: + u according to (2.7). Therefore, choosing 
u = a(Ic:I)c: and c: sufficiently small we get a contradiction, hence proving that 
h(t,x) i=- y for all 0::; t::; 1 and all x E oB(c:). This finishes the proof of Theorem 
5 .• 
As an interesting special case we conclude from Theorem 5 the following 

64 
CHAPTER 2 SYMPLECTIC CAPACITIES 
Corollary. A linear map A in ]R2n preserving the capacities of ellipsoids, c(A(E)) = 
c(E) is either symplectic or antisymplectic. 
A*wo = Wo or A*wo = -woo 
Let c be any capacity function and consider a homeomorphism h of ]R2n satis-
fying 
c(h(E)) = c(E) for all (small) ellipsoids E. 
Then, if h is in addition differentiable, we conclude from Theorem 5 that h is 
a diffeomorphism which is either symplectic or antisymplectic, h'(x)*wo = ±wo. 
This is analogous to a measure preserving homeomorphism, i.e., a homeomorphism 
satisfying (2.3). Here we conclude that det h'(x) = ±1 in case h is differentiable. 
We see that every capacity function c singles out the distinguished group of home-
omorphisms preserving the capacity of all open sets. The elements of this group of 
homeomorphisms have the additional property that they are symplectic or anti-
symplectic in case they are differentiable. This group can, therefore, be viewed as 
a topological version of the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms. It is not known 
whether this group is closed under locally uniform limits. But the following weaker 
results hold true. 
Theorem 6. Assume hj : ]R2n ---+ ]R2n is a sequence of homeomorphisms satisfying 
for all (resp. all small) ellipsoids E. Assume hj converges locally uniformly to a 
homeomorphism h of ]R2n. Then 
c(h(E)) = c(E) 
for all (resp. all small) ellipsoids E. 
Proof. Since h-1 ohj ---+ id locally uniformly, we conclude for every ellipsoid E and 
every 0 < c: < 1 
if only j is sufficiently large. This topological fact is easily verified using the same 
degree argument as above. Hence 
hj ((l- c:)E) c h(E) c hj ((l + c:)E). 
By monotonicity and conformality, (1-c:)2c(E) = c((l-c:)E) = c(hj((l-c:)E)) :::; 
c(h(E)) :::; c(hj ((l + c:)E)) = c((l + c:)E) = (1 + c:)2c(E). In short 
(1- c:)2c(E) :::; c(h(E)) :::; (1 + c:)2c(E). 
This holds true for every c: > 0 so that c(h(E)) = c(E) as desired .• 

2.2 RIGIDITY OF SYMPLECTIC DIFFEOMORPHISMS 
65 
In order to generalize this statement, we denote by 0 the family of open and 
bounded sets of ]R2n and associate with 0 E 0 
c(O) 
sup { c(U) IU open and U cO} 
e(O) 
inf { c(U) IU open and U:::) n} . 
The distinguished family Oc of open sets is defined by the condition 
Oc = {O E 0 Ie (0) = c(O)} . 
Proposition 7. Assume hj is a sequence of homeomorphisms of ]R2n converging 
locally uniformly to a homeomorphism h of]R2n. If c(hj(U)) = c(U) for all U E 
o and all j, then c(h(O)) = c(O) for all 0 E Oc. 
Proof. If 0 E Oc and e > 0 we find U, U E 0 with U :::) nand U c 0 satisfying 
c(U) ~ c(O) + e and c(U) ~ c(O) - e. 
For j large we have by the above degree argument hj(U) :::) h(O) :::) hj(U), and 
hence using the monotonicity property of the capacity 
so that c(O) + e ~ c(h(O)) ~ c(O) - e. This holds true for every e > 0 and the 
theorem is proved .• 
Definition. A capacity c is called inner regular, respectively, outer regular if 
c(U) = c(U) 
resp. if 
c(U) = e(U) 
for all U E O. 
Proposition 8. Assume the capacity c is inner regular or outer regular. Assume CPj 
and cP are homeomorphisms of ]R2n and 
locally uniformly. If c(cpj(U)) = c(U) for all U E 0 and all j, then also 
c( cp(U)) = c(U) 
for all U E O. 

66 
CHAPTER 2 SYMPLECTIC CAPACITIES 
Proof a) Assume c is inner regular and let f! be open and bounded. Then if U 
is open and U c f! we have CPj(U) C cp(f!) if j is large and thus c(cpj(U)) = 
c(U) ~ c(cp(f!)) so that c(U) ~ c(cp(f!)). Hence, taking the supremum we find 
e(O) ~ e(cp(O)). Similarly one shows that e(O) ~ e(cp-l(O)) for every open and 
bounded set O. Consequently, since cp is a homeomorphism e(O) = e(cp-1ocp(O)) 2:: 
e( cp(O)) 2:: e(O) and thus e( cp(O)) = e(O) as desired. 
b) If e is outer regular and 0 is open and bounded we conclude for c > 0 
that cpj(O) C U,,(cp(O)) if j is sufficiently large; here U" = {xl dist (x, U) < c}. 
Therefore, e(O) = e(cpj(O)) ~ e(U,,(cp(O))) and taking the infimum on the right 
hand side we find e(O) ~ e(cp(O)). Arguing as in the part a) we conclude that 
e(cp(O)) = e(O) for every 0 E O .• 
So far we have deduced from the existence of a symplectic capacity some sur-
prising phenomena about symplectic mappings. Nevertheless, the notion itself is 
still rather mysterious and raises many questions. It is, for example, not known 
whether the knowledge of the capacities of small sets is sufficient to understand the 
capacity of larger sets. To be more precise, does, for example, a homeomorphism 
preserving the capacity of small sets preserve the capacity of large sets? 
We have no example of a homeomorphism which preserves one capacity but not 
another. Neither do we know whether a homeomorphism preserving the capacity 
of open sets, also preserves the Lebesgue measure of open sets. But it is easy to see 
that a homeomorphism preserving all capacities of open sets is necessarily measure 
preserving. In order to prove this we first define a special embedding capacity "Y. 
Introducing for r > 0 the open cube 
Q(r) = (O,r)2n C ]R2n, 
having edges parallel to the coordinate axis, we define 
"Y(M,w) : = sup {r21 there is a symplectic embedding cp: Q(r) --+ M}. 
Clearly "Y is a capacity satisfying the Axioms (AI), (A2) and the weak nontriviality 
condition (A3'). It is not normalized. One can prove, by using the n-th order 
capacity function en of Ekeland and Hofer in [69], that "Y(B(r)) = ~7rr2, moreover 
"Y(Z(r)) = 7rr2. 
Proposition 9. Assume h is a homeomorphism of ]R2n satisfying 
for all 0 E O. Then h preserves the Lebesgue measure /-L of open sets, i.e., 
for all 0 E O. 

2.2 RIGIDITY OF SYMPLECTIC DIFFEOMORPHISMS

Proof. From the definition of "( we infer 
Since every symplectic embedding is volume preserving we find for the capacity 
"((0) of the open and bounded set 0 C ffi.2n that 
where the supremum is taken over those r, for which there is a symplectic embed-
ding Q(r) -r O. If Q is any open cube having its edges parallel to the coordinate 
axes we conclude that 
It follows that 
for every 0 E O. Indeed assume 0 E 0; then given E > 0 we find, in view of the 
regularity of the Lebesgue measure, finitely many disjoint open cubes Q j contained 
in 0 such that J-l(0) -
E ::; '£ J-l( Qj). Hence by the estimate above 
J-l(0) -E < '£ J-l(h(Qj)) 
J-l(h(UQj)) 
J 
< J-l(h(O)). 
This holds true for every E > 0 and the claim follows. By the same argument, 
J-l(0) ::; J-l(h-1(0)) and hence J-l(0) ::; J-l(h(O)) ::; J-l(h-1 0 h(O)) = J-l(0) , proving 
the proposition .• 
Corollary. If a homeomorphism of ffi.2n preserves all the capacities of open sets in 
ffi.2n , then it also preserves the Lebesgue measure. 
All our considerations so far are based on the existence of a capacity not yet 
established. In the next chapter we shall construct a very special capacity function 
defined dynamically by means of Hamiltonian systems. 

Chapter 3 
Existence of a capacity 
This chapter is devoted to the existence proof of a distinguished capacity function, 
denoted by Co, and introduced by H. Hofer and E. Zehnder in [123]. It is intimately 
related to periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems. The capacity Co (M, w) measures 
the minimal CO-oscillation of special Hamiltonian functions H : M ----'t ~, needed in 
order to conclude the existence of a distinguished periodic orbit having small pe-
riod and solving the associated Hamiltonian system X H on M. For 2-dimensional 
manifolds, Co agrees with the total area, and in the special case of convex, open and 
smooth domains U C (~2n, wo) it is represented by a distinguished closed charac-
teristic of the boundary au having minimal (reduced) action equal to Co (U, wo). 
This can be used, for example, to exhibit a class of compact hypersurfaces in ~2n , 
which are not symplectically diffeomorphic to convex ones. The proof will be based 
on the action principle. The variational approach will be explained in detail. In 
the analytical framework of the Sobolev space Hl/2, we shall introduce a special 
minimax argument which originated in the work of P. Rabinowitz. The construc-
tion of the capacity Co completes the proof of the symplectic rigidity phenomena 
described in Chapter 2. The special features of Co, however, will also be useful later 
on for the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. 
3.1 
Definition of the capacity Co 
If (M,w) is a symplectic manifold we recall that to a smooth function H : M ----'t 1R 
there belongs a unique Hamiltonian vector field X H on M defined by 
w(XH(x), v) = -dH(x)(v), v E TxM 
and x E M. A T-periodic solution x(t) of the Hamiltonian equation 
is a solution satisfying the boundary conditions x(T) = x(O) for some T > o. 
We now single out a distinguished class of Hamiltonian functions H which look 
qualitatively as depicted in the following figure 3.1. 
When M has a boundary aM, the Hamiltonian vector field X H has compact 
support contained in the interior of M. Our guiding principle is the hope that 
if the oscillation of the function H is sufficiently large, then the corresponding 
Hamiltonian vector field possesses, independently of the size of its support, a fast 
periodic solution, i.e., a periodic solution having a small period T, say 0 < T ::; 1.

Fig. 3.1 
To be precise we denote by 1i(M,w) the set of smooth functions H on M 
satisfying the following three properties: 
P.l. There is a compact set K c M (depending on H) such that K c (M\8M) 
and 
H(M\K) == m(H) (a constant) 
P.2. There is an open set U c M (depending on H) on which 
H(U) == 0 
P.3. 0:::; H(x) :::; m(H) for all x E M. 
The constant m(H) = maxH - minH is the oscillation of H. A function 
HE 1i(M,w) will be called admissible if all the periodic solutions of i; = XH(X) 
on M are either constant, i.e., x(t) == x(O) for all t or have a period T > I. 
Abbreviating the set of admissible functions by 1ia(M,w) c 1i(M,w), we define 
eo(M,w) = sup {m(H) I HE 1ia(M,w)}. 
Therefore, if co(M, w) < 00 then this number is characterized by the property that 
for every function H in 1i(M,w) whose oscillation satisfies m(H) > co(M,w), the 
vector field XH possesses a nonconstant T-periodic solution for some 0 < T :::; 1, 
and co(M,w) is the infimum of the real numbers having this property. The main 
result of this chapter is 
Theorem 1. The function Co is a symplectic capacity. Moreover, CO = CO, i.e., eo 
has the property of inner regularity. 
As an illustration, we consider the ellipsoid E in (1R2n, wo) determined by the 
invariants rl(E) :::; r2(E) :::; .. . rn(E). We know that c(E,wo) = 7rrl(E)2 for every 
capacity c. This linear invariant can, therefore, dynamically be defined as follows: 

3.1 DEFINITION OF THE CAPACITY Co 
71 
Proposition 1. If H E H(E,wo) satisfies m(H) > 7ITl(E)2, then the Hamiltonian 
vector field X H on E possesses a nonconstant periodic solution of period 0 < T $ 
1. Moreover, 7ITl(E)2 is the infinimum of the real numbers with this property. 
Corollary. If HE H(B(r),wo) satisfies 
then the Hamiltonian system x = X H (x) on B (r) has a nonconstant periodic 
solution of period 0 < T $ 1. 
Observe first that the statement about inner regularity eo(M,w) = i:o(M,w) 
follows immediately from the definitions. We only consider the case eo(M, w) < 00, 
the case eo (M, w) = 00 if treated similarly. If c > 0 then there exists H E Ha (M, w) 
with m(H) > co(M,w) - c. Let K = supp (XH ) C (M\8M) and pick an open 
set U with K cUe fj c (M\8M). Clearly H E Ha(U,w) and hence eo(U,w) ~ 
co(M,w) - c so that co(M,w) = sup{eo(U,w) I U c M open and fj C M\8M} 
which by definition is equal to Co (M, w) . 
We have to prove that co(M,w) meets the axioms of a capacity c which we 
recall for the convenience of the reader. All the symplectic manifolds considered 
are of fixed dimension 2n. 
A.1. c(M,w) $ c(N, a) provided there exists a symplectic embedding <p: M -t N. 
A.2. c(M,aw) = lal c(M,w), a # O. 
A.3. c(Z(I),wo) = 7r = c(B(I),wo). 
The first two properties follow very easily from the definition of co. 
Lemma 1. Co satisfies the monotonicity axiom A.1. 
Proof. If <p : M -t N is a symplectic embedding we can define the map <p* 
H(M,w) -t H(N,a) as follows: 
if 
x E <p(M) 
if 
x (j. <p(M). 
Note that if K c M\8M for a compact set K C M, then also <p(K) C N\8N, 
so that indeed <p* (H) E H(N, a). Clearly m( <p* (H)) = m(H), so that the lemma 
follows if we show that <p* (Ha(M, w)) C Ha (N, a). Since <p is symplectic <p* (XH ) = 
Xcp.(H) on <p(M) so that the flows are conjugated. In particular, the nonconstant 
periodic solutions together with their periods correspond to each other .• 
Lemma 2. Co satisfies the conformality axiom A.2. 
Proof. Assume a # 0 and define the obvious bijection 'IjJ : H(M, w) -t H(M, aw) by 
'IjJ : H t-+ lal·H = Ha:. Clearly m(Ha:) = lal·m(H) so that the lemma follows if we 
show that 'IjJ is also a bijection between Ha(M,w) and Ha(M, aw). By the definition 

72

of Hamiltonian vector fields (aw) (XHa") = -dHa. = -laldH = lal W(XH, .). 
Hence, since w is nondegenerate 
Therefore, XHa = X H or XHa = -XH and the two vector fields have the same 
periodic solutions with the same periods .•

Define H(x) = f(lxI 2 ) for x E B(1). Then m(H) = 1l' -
15 and we claim that 
H E 1ta (M, w). Indeed, the Hamiltonian system 
-Ji; = 'VH(x) = 21'(lxI2 )x 
has the function G(x) = !lxl2 as integral, since ('VG, J'V H) = 2 ff (lxI2) (x, Jx) = 
O. Therefore, if x(t) is a solution, then 
2 l' (lx(tW) = a 
is constant and the solution satisfies 
-Ji; = ax. 

3.1 DEFINITION OF THE CAPACITY Co 
73 
Consequently, all the solutions are periodic and given by x(t) = eaJtx(O) = 
(cosat)x(O) + (sinat)Jx(O). If a = 0 then the solution is constant, while if a> 0 
the period is given by T = 2; > 1 since, by construction, 0 ::; a < 27r. Therefore, 
H is admissible as we wanted to prove .• 
The inclusion map B(l) --+ Z(l) is a symplectic embedding and we deduce 
from Lemma 1 and Lemma 3 
co(Z(l)) ~ co(B(l)) ~ 7r. 
In order to show that Co meets the normalization A.3 we have to prove that 
co(Z(l)) ::; 7r. This is the subtle part of the proof. It requires an existence proof 
and our next aim is to prove 
Theorem 2. If H E 7t(Z(l)) satisfies m(H) > 7r, then the Hamiltonian system 
x = JV'H(x) on Z(l) possesses a periodic solution in Z(1) having period T = 1 
and which is not a constant solution. 
The theorem is qualitative in nature. We observe that, in proving Theorem 2, 
we may replace H by H 0 'IjJ, where 'IjJ is a compactly supported symplectic diffeo-
morphism of z2n(1), i.e., the closure of the set {xl'IjJ(x) =I- x} is a compact subset 
of z2n(1). Indeed, in view of the transformation law of Hamiltonian vector fields 
(Chapter 1), the flows of X H and XHo,p are conjugated. Using this observation, we 
may assume without loss of generality that H vanishes in a neighborhood of the 
origin. This is proved as follows. By assumption HIU == O. We pick a point Zo E U 
and choose a smooth function p : ]R2n --+ ]R with compact support in z2n(1) and 
which is equal to 1 on a neighborhood V of the line {tzo 10 ::; t ::; 1} connecting 
the origin with zoo Define the Hamiltonian K : z2n(1) --+ ]R by 
K(z) = p(z)(z, -Jzo) . 
Then the time-1 map'IjJ of X K is symplectic and has compact support in z2n(1). 
Since XK(Z) = Zo if Z E V, the line 'ljJt(O) = tzo is a solution for 0 ::; t ::; 1 moving 
the origin to the point Zo. Hence 
'IjJ(0) = Zo, 
and the Hamiltonian H 0 'IjJ vanishes in a neighborhood of O. 
From now on we therefore assume that the Hamiltonian H vanishes in an open 
neighborhood of the origin and first extend H defined on Z(l) to a function defined 
on the whole space ]R2n. This is, of course, easy since the function is constant near 
the boundary of Z(l). However, in view of the proof later on, we shall choose a 
very special continuation. Observe first that if HE 7t(Z(1),wo) then there exists 
an ellipsoid E = EN such that H E 7t(E,wo), where 
EN = {z E 
]R2n I q(z) < 1} , 

74

is, in the coordinates z = (x, y) given by, 
n 
q(z) = (x~ + y~) + ~2 L (x; + y;) 
j=2 
and N E Z+ is sufficiently large (Fig. 3.3). 
Since H E 1i(Z(I),wo) satisfies m(H) > 7r there is an C > 0 such that m(H) > 
7r + c. We can, therefore, pick a smooth function J : lR ---t lR satisfying

The extension of H is now defined by

H(z) =

z tt E. 
Clearly H E Coo (lR2n) and H is quadratic at infinity, 
H(z) = (7r + c)q(z), 
if /z/ ~ R 
for some large R. The following crucial proposition describes the distinguished 
periodic solutions we are looking for. 
Proposition 2. Assume x(t) is a periodic solution of ± = XH(x) having period 1. 
If it satisfies 
1 
q,(x):= J 
{~(-J±,X)-H(X(t))}dt>O, 
o 
then x(t) is nonconstant and x(t) c E. Hence x(t) is a nonconstant I-periodic 
solution of the original system ± = XH(X) on Z(I).

Proof. If x(t) = x* is a constant solution, then <I>(x*) ::; 0 since H ~ o. The 
Hamiltonian vector field XIi vanishes on DE. Therefore, if for a solution x(to) ~ E 
for some to, then x(t) ~ E for all t E lR and hence it solves the equation 
-Ji: = VH(x) = J'(q(x))· Vq(x). 
Note that, outside of E, the function q is an integral of this equation since 
(Vq, Jf'(q)Vq) = J'(q)(Vq, JVq) = o. Consequently, if x(t) is a solution then 
q(x(t)) = q(x(to)) = T

By definition of I, this is smaller than or equal to (Jr + C:)7 - (Jr + C:)7 = O. Hence 
<l>(x) ::::: 0 for all solutions outside of E and the proposition is proved .• 
In view of this remark we have to find a I-periodic solution x = x(t) of the 
Hamiltonian system x = X If( x) which satisfies <l>( x) > O. In the following we shall 
change the notation and replace H by H. In order to establish the existence of a 
periodic solution, we make use of a well-known variational principle for which the 
critical points are the required periodic solutions. To introduce this principle, we 
proceed at first on a informal level and consider the loop space 
of smooth loops in lR2n. We define a function <l> : n ---> lR by setting 
1 
1 
<l>(x) = J ~ (-Jx,x) dt - J H(x(t))dt, 
x E n, 
o 
0 
and claim that the critical points of <l> are the periodic solutions of x = XH(X). 
Computing the derivative at x E n in the direction of yEn, we find 
<l>'(x)(y) 
to <l> (x + c:y) 10=0 
1 J (-Jx - V'H(x),y)dt. 
o 
Consequently, <l>' (x) (y) = 0 for all yEn if and only if the loop x satisfies the 
equation 
-Jx(t) - V'H(x(t)) = 0, 
i.e., x(t) is a solution of the Hamiltonian equation which also satisfies x(O) = x(I). 
Hence it is periodic of period 1. Therefore, the principle picks out precisely the 
I-periodic solutions among the intricate set of all solutions of a Hamiltonian vector 
field. This principle is the well-known action principle in mechanics, where it is 

3.2 THE MINIMAX IDEA 
77 
often used to derive the transformation law of Hamiltonian vector fields. It might 
seem rather awkward to use this principle for existence proofs, since it is highly 
degenerate. Indeed, taking the special loops Xj, 
Xj(t) = ej27rJtf. = (cosj27rt)f. + (sinj27rt)Jf. 
where 1f.1 = 1, one computes readily for the first part of <I> 
1 J 
~ (-Ji;j,Xj) dt = 7rj, IIXjllL2 = 1, 
o 
while the second part of <I> stays bounded. We see that the functional is bounded 
neither below nor above. In particular, the variational techniques based on mini-
mizing sequences do not apply. This is in sharp contrast to the variational principle 
for closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. This geometric problem gave rise to 
two powerful variational methods, the so-called Morse theory and the Ljusternik-
Schnirelman theory. We should also mention that the Morse theory is not applica-
ble directly to our functional. Indeed, a priori the Morse indices of critical points 
are infinite and hence topologically not visible. It is this difficulty which forced 
Andreas Floer to develop powerful new techniques extending the Morse theory, 
which led him to the so-called Floer complex described in more detail later on. 
It was only relatively recently that P. Rabinowitz [180, 181] demonstrated 
that the degenerate variational principle can be used very effectively for existence 
proofs. For this purpose he introduced special minimax principles adapted to the 
structure of the functional <I>. Before we describe the technical details, it might be 
helpful to recall in an abstract setting the minimax idea. 
3.2 The minimax idea 
We consider a differentiable function 
defined on a Hilbert space E whose inner product is denoted by (.,.) and whose 
norm is IIxI1 2 = (x, x) for x E E. We search for critical points of f, i.e., points 
x* E E at which the derivative of f vanishes: 
df(x*) = 0 {::::::} df(x*)(y) = 0 for all y E E. 
The derivative df(x) is, by definition, an element ofthe dual space £(E,R) = E*. 
Recall that by a well-known theorem due to F. Riesz, there is a distinguished linear 
isometry J from E* onto E such that e*(x) = (J(e*),x) for every x E E, where 
e* E E*. Therefore, 
df(x)(y) = (v(x),-y) 
and 
Ildf(x)ll* = Ilv(x)11 

78 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
where v(x) E E is uniquely determined by df(x). It is called the gradient of f at 
x (with respect to the inner product ( ',' )) and denoted by 
v(x) = ,\,f(x) E E. 
The critical points of f are the zeros of the gradient function x 1--+ '\' f (x) in E. 
Using a dynamical approach, we interpret the critical points of f as the equilibrium 
points of the gradient equation 
:i; = -'\' f(x), x E E. 
This is an ordinary differential equation on E, and we shall assume now that it 
has a global flow cpt(x), i.e., that we can solve the Cauchy initial value problem 
uniquely and for all times t E 1R: 
x, 
for all initial conditions x E E. Such a global flow does exist, for example, if there 
is a constant M ~ 0 such that II'\' f(x) - '\' f(y) II 
~ Mllx - yll for all x, y E E, as 
is, of course, well-known. The crucial property ofthe gradient flow is that f(cpt(x)) 
decreases along nonconstant solutions cpt (x). This follows immediately from the 
definitions; indeed 
df (cps (x)) (fs cps (x)) 
df (cps (x)) (-'\' f( cps (x))) 
In particular,

Since E is not compact we cannot expect f to have any critical points unless we 
impose additional conditions on f, as the example f(x) = e-x on x E IR already 
shows. The following strong compactness condition goes back to Palais and Smale 
[175] and guarantees a critical point in many variational problems. 
Definition. f is said to satisfy P.S., if every sequence Xj E E satisfying 
for some c ~ 0, possesses a convergent subsequence. Since f is assumed to be C 1 , 
the limit of this subsequence is a critical point of f. 

3.2 THE MINIMAX IDEA 
79 
If F is a family of subsets FeE one defines the minimax c(f, F) belonging 
to f and F by 
c(f,F) = inf supf(x) 
E lR.U{oo}U{-oo} 
FEF xEF 
Minimax Lemma. Assume fECI (E, lR.) and F meet the following conditions: 
(i) f satisfies P.S. 
(ii) x = -'\If(x) defines a global flow cpt(x) 
(iii) The family F is positively invariant under the flow, i.e., if F E F then 
cpt(F) E F for every t ?: 0 
(iv) -00 < c(f, F) < 00. 
Then the real number, c(f, F) is a critical value of f, i.e., there exists x* E E 
satisfying 
'\l f(x*) = 0 and f(x*) = c(f, F). 
Proof. Abbreviating c = c(f, F) which, by assumption, is a real number, we shall 
show that for every E > 0 there exists an x E E satisfying 
c -
E :s: f(x) :s: c + E and II '\l f(x) II :s: E. 
Then choosing Ej = Ifj we find a sequence Xj which has, by the PS. condition, 
a convergent subsequence whose limit satisfies '\If(x*) = 0 and f(x*) = c, hence 
proving the Lemma. Arguing by contradiction we find an E > 0 such that 
(3.2) 
II '\If(x) II > E 
for all x satisfying c -
E :s: f(x) :s: c + E. By the definition of c, there exists an 
F E F satisfying 
(3.3) 
sup f(x) :s: C+E. 
xEF 
Pick a point x E F; then f(x) :s: c + E and we claim that the solution cpt(x) 
satisfies f(cpt* (x)) :s: c -
E if t* = 2/E. Indeed, if f(cpt(x)) :s: c -
E for some 
o :s: t :s: t* there is nothing to prove since f(cpt(x)) is decreasing. Assume now, by 
contradiction, that f(cpt(x)) > c -
E for all 0 :s: t :s: t*. Then by, (3.2), we have 
II'\lf(cpt(x))11 ?: E, for 0 :s: t :s: t*, and hence, by (3.1), f(cpt(x)) :s: f(x) -
E2t, so 
that f(cpt* (x)) :s: c + E -
E2t* = C -
E, a contradiction. Setting F* = cpt* (F) we 
have shown that 
sup f(x) :s: C-E. 
xEF* 
Since, by assumption, F* E F, this estimate contradicts the definition of c .•

For example, if f is, in addition, bounded from below we can choose F to be 
the family of subsets {x} consisting of the elements of E so that 
cU,F) = inf f(x). 
xEE 
The lemma then guarantees a minimum, i.e., we find x* E E satisfying \7 f (x*) = ° 
and 
f(x*) = inf f(x). 
xEE 
As another illustration we describe the celebrated Mountain Pass Lemma dis-
covered by A. Ambrosetti and P. Rabinowitz [6]. We reproduce the visually at-
tractive version found in R. Palais and C. Terng [174]. A subset R c E is called a 
mountain range relative to f if it separates E, if 
ex := inf f > -00 
R 
and if on every component of E\R, the function f assumes a value strictly less 
than ex. Consider an f E C1(E,JR) satisfying the P.S. condition and assume that 
the gradient equation generates a global flow. 
Mountain Pass Lemma. If R c E is a mountain range relative to f, then f has a 
critical value c satisfying 
c ~ inf f.

Proof. We choose two different components EO and El of E\R and define E~ = 
{x E Ej I f(x) < ex} for j = 0,1. By assumption, these sets are not empty. Let r be 
the set of all continuous paths "( : [0,1] --4 E satisfying "((0) E E~ and "((1) E E"; 
and define the family F of compact subsets of E by 
F = { image h) I "( E r}.

Since ')'(0) and ')'(1) belong to different components of E\R, we conclude that 
')'(to) E R for some 0 < to < 1 so that f(')'(to)) ::::: a and hence 
a::::: cU,F) < 00. 
In view of the minimax lemma, it suffices to verify that F is positively invariant 
under the flow <pt of - \7 f. For this it is sufficient to show that if x E E~ then also 
<pt(x) E E~ for all t ::::: O. But this follows in view of f(<pt(x)) :S f(<p°(x)) = f(x) < 
a for all t ::::: O .• 
For other versions of the Mountain Pass Lemma as well as for many applica-
tions, we refer to the books Variational methods by M. Struwe [208] and Minimax 
methods in critical point theory with applications to differential equations by P. 
Rabinowitz [182]. It should be said that if f is bounded neither from above nor 
from below, it is often a subtle task to analyze the qualitative behaviour of f and 
to find an appropriate family F meeting the estimate (iv) above. This will be done 
for our special functional <P in the next two sections. First, however, we have to 
define the appropriate functional analytic setting. 
As for more sophisticated classical techniques in critical point theory, we would 
like to mention the classical paper by RS. Palais [173] (1970) and the monographs 
by P. Blanchard, E. Bruning [28] (1992), by J. Mawhin, M. Willem [152] (1989) 
and, quite recently, by Kung-Ching Chang [39] (1993). New methods designed for 
the action functional on the loop space of a compact symplectic manifold will be 
described in Chapter 6.

CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
3.3 
The analytical setting 
Let H E Coo (]R.2n ,]R.) denote the special Hamiltonian function introduced in Sec-
tion 3.1. It vanishes on an open neighborhood of the origin and satisfies 
(3.4) 
H(z) = Q(z), Izl 2 R , 
with the quadratic form Q(z) = (7r + c)q(z),z E ]R.2n. We shall translate these 
properties of the Hamiltonian into properties of the corresponding functional <P 
on an appropriate Hilbert space. Recall that on the space n = Coo (Sl , ]R.2n) of 
smooth loops <P is defined by 
1 
1 
(3.5) 
<p(x) = J H-Jx,x)dt- J H(x(t))dt, x E n. 
o 
0 
In order to find the convenient Hilbert space, we represent the periodic loops 
x E Coo (S\ ]R.2n) by their Fourier-series 
(3.6) 
x(t) = 2.: ek21fJt Xk, Xk E ]R.2n 
kEZ 
which converge, together with all their derivatives, in the supremum norm. Con-
sidering first the dominant part of <P which reflects the symplectic structure, we 
abbreviate 
(3.7) 
1 
a(x,y) = J 
!(-Jx,y)dt, x,y E n. 
o 
Then, inserting the Fourier expansions of x, yEn into a(x, y), and observing that 
one obtains

Consequently, a(x, y) can be defined as aeontinuous bilinear form on the larger 
space H 1/ 2 = H1/2(Sl) which is a special Sobolev space. Recall that the spaces

where

is the Fourier series of x which converges in L2(81). The space H S is a Hilbert 
space with inner product and associated norm defined by 
(xo, YO/ + 27f I: IkI 2S (xk,Yk/ 
kEZ 
(x, xIs, 
for x, Y E H S • Note that the norm Ilxllo is equivalent to the L2-norm. We shall 
denote the distinguished Hilbert space H1j2 which will be the underlying space of 
our functional by 
E

2 
2 
There is an orthogonal splitting of E 
into the spaces of x E E having only Fourier coefficients for j < 0, j = 0, j > O. 
The corresponding orthogonal projections are denoted by P-, pO, P+. Therefore, 
every x E E has a unique decomposition 
In view of (3.8) we define for x, Y E E 
(3.9) 
a(x,y) 
which is a continuous bilinear form on E and which agrees for x, y E Coo (81 , ~2n) 
with (3.7). The function a : E -7lR, defined by 
(3.10) 
is differentiable with derivative 
da(x)(y) 

84 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
so that the gradient of a is 
(3.11) 
V'a(x) = (P+ - P-)x 
at every point x E E. 
Next we point out some useful properties of the spaces HS needed later on. 
Clearly the spaces decrease, 
Ht C H S c H O for t ~ s ~ 0, 
while the norms increase: 
Ilxllt ~ Ilxlls ~ Ilxllo for x E Ht. 
In particular, the inclusion maps I : Ht -t H S for t ~ s are continuous. 
Proposition 3. Assume t > s ~ O. Then the inclusion map I : Ht -t HS is compact, 
i.e., it maps bounded sets of Ht onto relatively compact subsets of HS. 
Proof. The continuous linear operator PN : Ht -t HS defined by 
PN X = L ek27rJt Xk 
Ikl~N 
has finite dimensional range and hence is a compact operator. The estimate 
II(PN -
I)xll~ = II L

Ikl>N 
shows that PN -t I in the operator norm, i.e., the norm of £(HS , Ht). Conse-
quently I is also compact, which is well-known and easily seen as follows. Let 
e > 0 and choose N so large that IIPN - III < e/2 in the operator-norm. If B is 
the unit ball in H t , then PN(B) c H S is covered by finitely many balls of radius 
e /2 which are centered at the points Yl, Y2, ... ,Ym E HS. Hence, if x E B we find 
an Yj satisfying IIPN(X) - Yilis < e/2 and together with IIPN(X) - I(x)lls < e/2 
this implies that III(x) - Yjlls < e. Thus I(B) is covered by finitely many balls 
of radius e > O. This holds true for every e > 0 and we conclude that I(B) is 
relatively compact in HS .• 
The set coo(Sl, ~2n) is dense in HS for every s ~ O. However, not all elements of 
H 1/ 2 are represented by continuous functions. In order to find continuous functions 
the following proposition will be helpful. 

3.3 THE ANALYTICAL SETTING 
85 
Proposition 4. Assume 8 > ~. If x E H S then x E C (S1 ). Moreover, there is a 
constant c = Cs such that 
sup Ix(t)l::; c Ilxlls' x E HS(S1). 
O::;t::;1 
Proof. We show that the Fourier series 
which converges in £2, also converges in the sup-norm. This follows from the 
estimates: 
L Ikl-s Ikls IXkl 
kicO 
< c Ilxlls, 
where we have used that 28 > 1. • 
The same argument shows that, more generally, if 8 > ~ + r for an integer r, 
then x E HS belongs to cr(S1) and 
sup 
IDjx(t)1 
< c Ilxlls, x E HS(S1) . 
OSjSr 
O::;t::;l 
This is again a special case of the Sobolev embedding theorem. In view of Propo-
sition 3, the inclusion map 
(3.12) 
is compact. Its adjoint operator 
(3.13) 
is, as usual, defined by 
(3.14) 
for all x E H 1/ 2 and y E £2. The following property of j* will be useful later on. 

86 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
Proposition s. 
The map j* factors: L2 -7 HI -7 H I/2, thus we have verified using Proposition 
3 that j* is a compact operator. This follows also from the compactness of j, as is 
well-known. 
Proof. By definition of the adjoint 
L (Xk' Yk) = (xo,j*(y)o) + 2n L Ikl (xk,j*(Yh)

for x E HI/2 C L2 and Y E L2. One reads off the following formula for j*

if Y E L2. The estimate 
is now obvious .• 
Coming back to the functional <I> , we next study the function 
1 
b(x) = J H(x(t)) dt, 
o 
recalling that H vanishes in a neighborhood of the origin. In view of IH(z)1 < 
Mlzl2, for all z E JR2n, this map b is defined for x E L2 and hence also for 
x E E C L2. If we consider b as a function on L2, we shall denote it by b, so that, 
with the inclusion map j : E -7 L2, we can write 
(3.15) 
b(x) = b(j(x)) , x E E. 
In order to prove that b: L2 -7 JR is differentiable, we start from the identity 
1 
(3.16) H(z +~) = H(z) + (\1 H(z),~) + J 
(\1 H(z + t~) - \1 H(z),~) dt 
o 
for z,~ E JR2n. Since IHzz(z)1 :S M the last term is :S MI~12. Assume now that 
x E L2 then \1H(x) = \1H(x(t)) E L2 in view of I\1H(z)1 :S Mizi for all z E JR2n. 
Therefore, given x and h E L2, we find by integration 
1 
b(x + h) = b(x) + J 
(\1 H(x), h) dt + R(x, h). 
IL __ 

3.3 THE ANALYTICAL SETTING 
87 
Moreover, IR(x, h)1 ~ M Ilhlli2. This estimate shows that b is differentiable with 
derivative at x given by 
1 
db(x)(h) 
J (\l H(x), h) dt = (\l H(x), hh2 
o 
(\lb(x), h)£2. 
For the gradient (with respect to L2) we read off \lb(x) = \lH(x) E L2. The 
derivative of b : E ---.. ~ is in view of (3.14) given by 
(\lb(x), y) = db(x)(y) 
db (j(x)) (j(y)) 
(\lb(j(x)),j(y)) £2 
Therefore, 
(3.17) 
\lb(x) = j*\lb (j(x)) = j*\lH(x). 
U*\lb(j(x)), y) . 
Lemma 4. The map b : E ---.. ~ is differentiable. Its gradient \lb : E ---.. E is 
continuous and maps bounded sets into relatively compact sets. Moreover, 
II\lb(x) - \lb(y) II 
~ Mllx - yll 
and Ib(x)1 ~ Mllxlli2 for all X,y E E. 
Proof. Clearly x ~ \l H (x) is globally Lipschitz continuous on L2 and maps, 
therefore, bounded sets into bounded sets. The first claim follows from (3.17), 
since j* : L2 ---.. E is compact. Moreover, 
II\lb(x) -
\lb(y)ll! = 11J*(\lH(x) - \lH(Y)) II! 
< II\lH(x) - \lH(y) 11£2 
~ M Ilx - yll£2 
< M Ilx - yll!· 
The last estimate follows from IH(z)1 ~ Mlzl2, for all z E ~2n .• 
It should be mentioned that b E COO(E,~) provided H E coo(~2n,~). This is 
readily seen by using the Taylor formula together with the nontrivial fact that E 
is continuously embedded in LP for every p ~ 1 which is proved in the Appendix. 
To keep our presentation elementary we shall, however, not use this observation 
here. Summarizing the discussion so far, we have extended <I? from the space 0 of 
smooth loops to the Hilbert space E :J 0 by 
<I?(x) = a(x) - b(x) , 
x E E. 

88 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
This function <P : E -t JR is differentiable and its gradient is given by 
\7<P(x) = x+ - x- - \7b(x). 
We are interested in classical solutions of differential equations. It is, therefore, 
important to observe now that a critical point of <P is not simply an element in E 
which might not even be a continuous function, but it is actually a smooth periodic 
solution of the Hamiltonian equation X H having period 1. Indeed the following 
"regularity" statement holds true. 
Lemma s. Assume x E E is a critical point, \7<P(x) = o. Then x E coo(SI). 
Moreover, it solves the Hamiltonian equation 
x(t) = J\7H (x(t)) , 
0::; t::; 1, 
so that x E n is a I-periodic solution. 
Proof. Represent x and \7H(x) E £2 by their Fourier expansions in £2 
x 
\7H(x) 
By assumption d<p(x)(v) = O. 
E ek21rJt xk 
E ek27rJt ak· 
Hence, using (\7b(x),v) = (j*\7H(x),v) = (\7H(X),V)£2, 
1 
((p+ -P-)x,v) = J 
(\7H(x),v) dt 
o 
for all vEE. Choosing the test functions v(t) = ek27rJt v, we find 
(3.18) 
and ao = O. We infer that 
so that x E HI and by Proposition 4, the element x E E belongs to C(SI). 
Consequently \7H(x(t)) E C(SI), and, therefore, 
t 
e(t) = J J\7H(x(t)) dt E C 1(JR). 
o 
Comparing the Fourier coefficients we find in view of (3.18), that e(t) = x(t)-x(O), 
hence x belongs to C1(S1) and also solves the equation x(t) = J\7H(x(t)). The 

3.3 THE ANALYTICAL SETTING 
89 
right hand side of the equation is in C 1 , hence x E C 2 , and iterating this argument 
we conclude that x E coo(Sl) as claimed .• 
The careful choice of the asymptotic behaviour of the Hamiltonian function H 
implies that X H has, in the region of ]R.2n where Izl is large, no periodic solutions 
of period 1. From this dynamical behaviour, we shall conclude that cI> satisfies the 
P.S. condition. 
Lemma 6. Every sequence Xj E E satisfying V'cI>(Xj) -7 0 contains a convergent 
subsequence. In particular, cI> satisfies the P.S. condition. 
Proof. Assume V'cI>(Xj) -7 0 so that 
(3.19) 
Recall the splitting Xj = xj + xJ + xj. If Xj is bounded in E, then xJ E ]R.2n is 
bounded and we conclude in view of the compactness of V'b that there exists a 
convergent subsequence. To prove that Xj is bounded we argue by contradiction 
and assume llxj II -7 00. Define 
Yk = Ilxkll 
so that IIYkl1 = 1. By assumption, using (3.17), 
(p+ - P-)Yk -
j* CI:kll V'H(Xk)) -7? 
Since IV' H(z)1 ::; Mizi the sequence 
V'H(Xk) E L2 
Ilxkll 
is bounded in L2. Since j* : L2 -7 E is compact, (P+ - P- )Yk is relatively compact, 
and since, in addition, YZ is bounded in ]R.2n, the sequence Yk is relatively compact 
in E. After taking a subsequence we can assume Yk -7 Y in E and hence Yk -7 Y 
in L 2 •

Since IV'H(z) - V'Q(z)1 ::; M for all z E ]R.2n and since V'Q defines a continuous 
linear operator of L 2 , we conclude 
Consequently, 

90 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
This implies that y E E solves the linear equation in E 
y+ - y- - j* 'VQ(y) 
0 
Ilyll = 1. 
As in Lemma 5 one verifies that y belongs to C= (81, lR2n) and also solves the 
linear Hamiltonian equation 
iJ(t) 
XQ (y(t)) 
y(O) 
y(l). 
n 
Recall now that Q = (7l'+c)q, and q(z) = (x~ +y~) + b E (xl +yl). We see that 
j=2 
the symplectic 2-planes {Xj, yj} are filled with periodic solutions of XQ having 
periods T f=. 1. Since the linear equation does not admit any nontrivial periodic 
solutions of period 1 we conclude y(t) = O. This contradicts lIyll = 1 and we 
conclude that the sequence Xk must be bounded .• 
The gradient equation 
:i; = -'Vq>(X), 
x E E 
is in view of Lemma 4 globally Lipschitz continuous and, therefore, defines a unique 
global flow 
lRxE-+E 
(t,X) 1---+ </(x) == X· t, 
which maps bounded sets into bounded sets. All this is well-known from the the-
ory of ordinary differential equations. Our flow has, in addition, a compactness 
property which will be crucial for the topological arguments in the next section. 
Lemma 7. The flow of:i; = -'Vq>(x) admits the representation 
(3.20) 
where K : lR x E -+ E is continuous and maps bounded sets into precompact sets. 
Proof. Prompted by the variation of constant formula, we define K by 
t 
K(t,x) = - J (et-sp-+pO+e-t+s P+)'Vb(x.s) ds. 
° 
We have to verify that K has the desired properties. Abbreviating the right hand 
side of (3.20) by y(t), one verifies readily that 
iJ(t) = (P- - p+)y(t) -
'Vb (x . t). 

3.4 THE EXISTENCE OF A CRITICAL POINT 
91 
Since yeO) = x, the function ~(t) = yet) - x . t solves the linear equation 
e(t) = (P- - p+) ~(t) and 
~(O) = O. 
By the uniqueness of the initial value problem ~(t) = 0 so that yet) = x . t as 
required. In view of (3.16) and (3.17) we can write 
Abbreviating the map in the bracket by k(t, x) then k : ~ x E ---+ L2 is continuous 
and maps bounded sets into bounded sets. By Proposition 5, the map j* : L2 ---+ 
E maps bounded sets into precompact sets and, therefore, K has the desired 
properties .• 
To sum up this rather technical section we have extended the classical Hamilto-
nian functional originally given on the loop space of smooth loops, and constructed 
a functional <I> E C 1 (E, ~) on the Hilbert space E. Its critical points, ifthere are 
any, are smooth periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian equations with period 1. 
The functional <I> has, in addition, crucial compactness properties. It remains to 
find a special critical point x* E E of <I> satisfying <I>(x*) > O. This will be done in 
the next section. 
3.4 The existence of a critical point 
A special minimax argument will guarantee the existence of a special critical point 
of the functional <I> introduced in the previous section: 
<I> (x) 
= 
a(x) - b(x) 
where x = x- + XO + x+ E E = E- EB EO EB E+. Recall that H ~ 0 and that His 
identically zero in a neighbourhood of z = 0 E ~2n. In addition H(z) = (1T+c) q(z) 
for Izl sufficiently large. Evidently, every critical point z E ~2n ofthe function H, 
i.e., a point in {zlV' H(z) = O}, is a critical point of <I> satisfying <I>(z) SO. We are 
looking for critical points of <I> which are not constant loops. 
Proposition 6. There exists x* E E satisfying V'<I>(x*) = 0 and <I>(x*) > O. 
In order to prove this proposition we first single out two distinguished subsets 
E and r of E. The bounded set E = Er C E is defined by 
Er = {x I x = x- + XO + se+ ,llx- + x011 STand 0 S SST} 

92 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
where T > 0. Here e+ E E+ is the element 
e+(t) = e27rJt el 
and 
el = (1,O, ... ,O)EJR2n . 
Clearly Ile+112 = 21f and Ile+ll£2 = 1. By ar, we denote the boundary of r, in 
E- + EO + JRe+. 
Lemma 8. There exists T* > ° such that for T 2: T* 
<I> I ar, :::; 0. 
Proof. We use the asymptotic behaviour of <I>. From alE- EEl EO :::; ° 
and b 2: ° 
we 
infer 
It remains to consider those parts of the boundary ar, which are defined by 
Ilx- + x O II = T or s = T. By the construction of H there exists a constant 'Y > ° 
such that 
H(z) 2: (1f + c) q(z) - 'Y 
for all z E JR2n . 
Therefore, 
1 
<I>(x) :::; a(x) - (1f + c) J q(x) + 'Y, 
for all x E E. 
° 
Recalling the definition of the quadratic form q, one verifies for the orthogonal 
splitting x = x- + xO + se+ E E- EEl EO + E+ that

Recalling that Ile+ 112 = 21f we can, therefore, estimate for x = x- + xO + se+

We thus find a constant c > ° 
such that

<I>(x- + xO + se+) :::; 'Y - c Ilx- + xOl12 - c Ilse+112. 
The right hand side is :::; ° 
if Ilx- + xO II = 7 or s = T for T sufficiently large. This 
finishes the proof of the lemma .• 
The subset r = rae E+ is defined by 

3.4 THE EXISTENCE OF A CRITICAL POINT 
Lemma 9. There exists an 0: > 0 and f3 > 0 such that 
<I> I r :2: f3 > o. 
93 
Proof. We use the behaviour of <I> locally near x = 0 E E. Recall that H vanishes 
identically near the origin in ]R2n. We shall prove that 
1 
b(x) IIxl12 -70 as Ilxll -7 O. 
It then follows for x E E+ that

<I>(x) IIxl12 = 2 - IIxl12 b(x) -7 2 . 
Consequently, <I>(x) :2: ~llxl12 provided Ilxll is small enough and this implies the 
desired result. Arguing indirectly, we find a sequence Xj E E and a constant d> 0 
satisfying 
Xj -70 and 
Set Yj = 
II~~ II so that IIYj II = 1. We claim that there is a subsequence Yj and 
functions y, w E L2 satisfying

for almost every t. 
Indeed, by Proposition 3, E is compactly embedded in L2. Hence we find 
a subsequence Yj which is a Cauchy sequence in L2 and the claim follows by 
the following well-known argument. Choosing a fast Cauchy subsequence we may 
assume that 
1 
IIYk+1 - Ykll£2 :S 2k

k:2: 1. 
Then the sequence fn E L2, defined by 
n 
fn(t) : = L IYk+l(t) - Yk(t)1 , 
k=l 
is monotone increasing and satisfies II f nil £2 :S 1. Hence by the monotone conver-
gence theorem fn(t) -7 f(t) a.e and f E L2. Since, for m > n, 
IYm(t) - Yn(t)1 
< IYm(t) - Ym-l(t)1 + ... + IYn+l(t) - Yn(t)1 
< f(t) - fn-l(t), 

94 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
we conclude that for a.e t the sequence Yn(t) is a Cauchy sequence in lR and hence 
defines y(t) := limYn(t) for a.e t. In view of Iy(t) - Yn(t)1 ~ f(t) we therefore 
find, by Lebesgue's convergence theorem, that Yn ---+ Y in L2 and, since IYn(t)1 ~ 
f(t) + ly(t)1 =: w(t) for a.e t and w E L2, the claim is proved. By definition 
From H(z) ~ M Iz12, for all z E lR2n, we infer 
for almost every t, so that the L1 function w(t)2 is a majorant. Using that H 
vanishes at z = 0 with its derivatives up to second order we find, using the Taylor 
formula, 
for almost every t. Hence by means of Lebesgue's theorem 
1 J H(Xj(t)) Ilx~1I2 dt ---+ 0, 
j ---+ 00. 
o 
This contradicts the assumption that d > 0 and Lemma 9 is proved .• 
The rather clumsy argument in the proof can, of course, be avoided if one makes 
use of the following well-known, but not quite elementary Sobolev estimate. The 
space H1/2(S1) is continuously embedded in LP(S1) for every p ~ 1. Hence there 
are constants M = Mp such that 
A proof can be found in the Appendix. Taking this estimate for granted and 
observing that IH(z)1 ~ clzl3 for all z E lR2n , we find a constant K > 0 such that 
101 IH( X(t)) Idt ~ c IIxlli3 ~ K IIxlI~/2 , 
for all x E H1/2. Now, if x E E+, then cI>(x) ~ ~llxW - KllxI13 and the lemma 
is now obvious. The following picture (Fig. 3.7) illustrates our situation more 
geometrically. 
The estimate cI>18E ~ 0 reflects our assumptions H ~ 0 and m(H) > 1f + c: 
for our original function H E 1t(Z(l),wo), while cI>lr ~ (3 > 0 is a consequence of

the assumption that H vanishes identically on some open set for which we could 
choose a neighbourhood of the origin in ]R2n. 
Next we study what happens if we translate the set E by means of the flow ipt(x) 
belonging to the gradient equation x = -'VcI>(x) on E. Since cI>(ipt(x)) decreases 
in t we conclude immediately from Lemma 8 that 
(3.21) 
By Lemma 9, on the other hand, cI>lr > 0 and consequently ipt(8E) nr = 0 for all 
t ~ 0; the "frame" ipt(8E) cannot cross the "circle" r as t increases. Intuitively it 
is, therefore, clear that the "surface" ipt (E) spanned by the frame must intersect 
r for every t ~ O. This requires, however, a proof. It will be based on a topological 
argument. 
Lemma 10. 
Postponing the proof we shall first finish the proof of Proposition 6. In fact, 
we are now in business. We can apply the following minimax argument. We take 
the family :F consisting of the subsets ipt(E), for every t ~ 0 and define 
c(cI>,:F) = inf 
sup 
cI>(x).

For the second estimate we have used that ell maps, in view of Lemma 4, bounded 
sets into bounded sets. Therefore, 
-00 < j3 ::::; c(ell, F) < 00. 
We know already that the functional ell satisfies the P.S. condition (Lemma 6) and 
that the gradient equation generates a unique global flow (Lemma 7). Moreover, by 
the properties of a flow, determined by time-independent equations, the family F 
is positively invariant. Consequently the Minimax Lemma guarantees that c( ell, F) 
is a critical value. We deduce a point x* E E satisfying \7ell(x*) = 0 and 
ell(x*) = c(ell, F) ~ j3 > 0, 
and the Proposition is proved. It remains to prove Lemma 10. 
Proof of Lemma 10. We shall use the Leray-Schauder degree. This degree extends 
the Brouwer mapping degree to infinite dimensional spaces for the restricted class 
of continuous mappings which are of the form id+ compact. Abbreviating the flow 
by ipt (x) == x . t, we wish to verify that (~ . t) n r =f 0 for all t ~ O. We can rewrite 
this by requiring

Since x E ~ is represented by x = x- + x O + se+, with 0 ::::: s ::::: T, we can rewrite 
(3.24) as follows: 
(3.25) 
o = x + B(t, x) 
and 
x E ~, 
where the operator B is defined by 
Abbreviating F = E- EB EO + ~ e+ the map B : ~ X F -+ F is continuous and 
maps bounded sets into relatively compact sets. This was proved in Lemma 7. 
We therefore can apply the Leray-Schauder index theory. The equation (3.25) 
possesses, for given t ~ 0, a solution x E ~ if we can show that deg(~, id + 
B(t, .), 0) i=- O. In order to compute this degree we first observe, in view of 'Pt(8~)n 
r = 0 for t ~ 0, that there is no solution of (3.25) on 8~, i.e., 
if t ~ O. Hence by the homotopy invariance of the degree, 
deg (~,id+B(t,.),O) = deg (~,id+B(O,.),O). 
Since K(O,x) = 0 we find B(O,x) = P+{(llxll-a)e+ -x}. Defining the homotopy 
Lp,(x) = p+ {(p,llxll - a) e+ - p,x} 
for 
0::::: p, ::::: 1, 
we claim x + Lp,(x) i=- 0 for x E 8~. Indeed, if x E ~ satisfies x + Lp,(x) = 0 then 
x = se+ and, therefore, s ((1- p,) + p, Ile+ II) = a. Consequently 0 < s ::::: a so that 
x tf- 8~ if T > a as claimed. Therefore, by homotopy again 
deg (~,id+B(t,.), 0) 
deg (~, id + La, 0) 
deg (~,id - ae+, 0) 
deg (~,id,ae+ )

provided that ae+ E ~, which holds true for T > a. This finishes the proof of 
Lemma 10 and therefore the proof of the proposition is completed .• 
The critical point found in the proposition is a smooth periodic solution of the 
Hamiltonian equation i = JVH(z) in ~2n having period 1, as we know from the 
"regularity" Lemma 5. This solution is the distinguished nonconstant I-periodic 

98 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
solution we are looking for in Theorem 2 whose proof, therefore, is completed. 
With this existence theorem for periodic solutions, we have also established the 
existence of the special capacity function eo(M,w). Consequently, the rigidity re-
sults deduced in the previous chapter from the existence of a capacity function 
C are now completely proved. We have demonstrated that these recently discov-
ered rigidity phenomena in symplectic geometry can be traced back to a simple 
minimax argument applied to the old action principle of classical mechanics. 
3.5 
Examples and illustrations 
In Chapter 2 we deduced from the axioms that open balls and cylinders in (]R.2n, wo) 
have the capacities c(B(r)) = e(Z(r)) = 7rr2 for every capacity function. This 
agrees with the actions of the closed characteristics of aB(r) and aZ(r) as we 
have seen in Chapter 1. For an ellipsoid E, the capacity c(E) also agrees with 
the action of a particular closed characteristic of its boundary aE. Recall that the 
(reduced) action A(-y) of a loop "( in (]R.2n, wo) is defined by 
A(-y) = J pdq. 
'Y 
We consider now, more generally, a convex bounded and smooth domain D of 
]R.2n. Its boundary aD carries at least one closed characteristic as we have demon-
strated in Chapter 1. It turns out, for the special capacity function Co constructed 
above, that eo(D) is also represented by a distinguished closed characteristic of 
the boundary of D. 
Theorem 3. Assume C C ]R.2n is a convex bounded domain with smooth boundary 
ac. Then there exists a distinguished closed characteristic "(* c ac satisfying 
co(C,wo) = IA(-Y*)1 
and IA(-y*) I 
inf { IA(-y) I : "( C ac is a closed characteristic }.

The proof of this theorem is quite similar to the proof of Theorem 2 and we 
refer to H. Hofer and E. Zehnder [123]. It is useful to point out that the same 
representation formula holds true for the different capacity function defined on 
subsets of ]R2n which was originally introduced by 1. Ekeland and H. Hofer [68]. 
Consequently, these two capacities agree on such convex subsets C C ]R2n. As 
another immediate consequence we conclude that the following estimate for the 
action of periodic solutions x on convex and compact smooth hypersurfaces 8C 
holds true: 
IA(x)1 ~ sup {1I"r2 
there exists 
a symplectic embedding r.p: B(r) ---+ C} = D(C,wo). 
Here we have used the monotonicity of co. This estimate considerably sharpens 
an inequality due to C. Croke and A. Weinstein [58] for periodic solutions of 
convex hypersurfaces. A. Kunzle [131] observed that Theorem 3 can also be used 
to describe a simple class of compact hypersurfaces in ]R.2n which cannot be mapped 
onto convex hypersurfaces by means of symplectic diffeomorphisms. Consider an 
open and bounded domain M C ]R.2n with smooth boundary S = 8M satisfying 
B(r) eM c Z(r) 
which is a full Bordeaux bottle as illustrated in the figure: 
8M

M 
M contains in particular a piece of a cylinder Z(p) having radius p < r. On 
this piece the characteristics 'Y of 8Z(p) are closed and have the action A("() = 
11" p2. Assume now by contradiction that r.p is a symplectic diffeomorphism of ]R.2n 
mapping M onto a convex domain C. Then it maps the hypersurface 8M onto the 
convex hypersurface 8C. From the invariance of the capacity function, we deduce 
1I"r2 = co(M) = co(r.p(M)) = co(C). 
By Theorem 3 we have, therefore, A("() ~ 1I"r2 for all characteristic loops 'Y of 8C. 
But r.p leaves the action invariant, so that 

100 
CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
which is a contradiction. Evidently, the capacity of the above manifold M is also 
represented by a closed characteristic on 8M which, however, does not minimize 
the action. As for general domains with smooth boundaries, it should be recalled 
that it is not known· whether every compact hypersurface in ]R2n admits a closed 
characteristic. 
In the special case of 2-dimensional compact symplectic manifolds, the regular 
energy surfaces are, of course, I-dimensional and consist of finitely many periodic 
orbits. This observation allowed K.F. Siburg [194] to compute the capacity Co in 
this case: 
Theorem 4. (K.F. Siburg) Assume (M,w) is a compact and connected symplectic 
manifold, possibly with boundary, with dim M = 2. Then 
eo(M,w) = I J wi· 
M 
We see that Co agrees with the total volume so that in dimension 2 this invariant 
classifies symplectically diffeomorphic manifolds. This was shown in Chapter l. 
Proof. We first show that for every capacity function c 
c(M,w) ~ I J wi· 
M 
Given E: > 0, then by removing finitely many compact curves on M, we find a 
simply connected manifold N c M which is diffeomorphic to a closed disc D C ]R2 
and which satisfies 
I J wi ~ I J wl- E: , 
N 
M 
and we can choose the radius ofthe disc D such that its Lebesgue measure, p,(D), 
agrees with the integral of w over N. (Recall that a Riemannian surface is obtained 
by a polygon in the plane by identifying suitably the edges; hence we might just 
remove the curves corresponding to these edges to get a disc, see W. Massey [148].) 
By the theorem of Dacorogna and Moser, see Chapter 1, this diffeomorphism can be 
chosen to be symplectic. Therefore, by the monotonicity property of the capacity 
c(M,w) ~ c(N,w) = c(D) = p,(D) ~ I J wl- E:. 
M 
This holds true for every E: > 0 and the desired estimate is proved. It remains to 
prove that 
co(M,w) ~ I J

We have to establish the existence of a nonconstant T-periodic solution of x =

By definition of 1t(M,w) we have H == m(H) near 8M. Therefore, if hER, then 
H~ 1 (h) consists of finitely many embedded circles 51 C M each of which carries 
precisely one (nonconstant) periodic solution ,(t, h) of X H . Choose, for every j, 
one of the components of H~l[aj,bj] and call it Aj. It is simply covered by a 
smooth family ,(t, h) of periodic solutions having periods denoted by T(h) > 0, 
when h E I j . Define the diffeomorphism cp = CPj 
cp: (t, h) f---+ ,(t, h) E A j , 
where 0 ::; t < T(h) and aj ::; h ::; bj. We claim 
cp*w = dt /\ dh. 
Indeed, since H(r(t,h)) = h for all t we conclude, denoting the partial derivatives 
with subscripts, w(rt, ,h) = dH(r(t, h))(rh) = 1. Therefore, one computes for

CHAPTER 3 EXISTENCE OF A CAPACITY 
In view of the definition of Co the desired estimate follows and the proof of the 
theorem is finished .• 
To illustrate this theorem we consider a compact 2-dimensional manifold with-
out boundary. In this case the proof shows that for every HE C 2(M, R) satisfying 
max H - min H > I I wi the Hamiltonian vector field XH admits a "fast" periodic 
solution of period 0 < T ::; 1. We would like to add another elementary observation 
concerning the special case of subsets of ]R2. We know from Chapter 2, that for 
every capacity function, c(D) = area(D) for a bounded connected subset D of]R2 
having smooth boundary. Since the special capacity Co has the additional property 
of inner regularity we can easily extend this statement to open subsets of ]R2. 
Proposition 7. If 0 C ]R2 is an open bounded and path connected set, then 
co(O,wo) = area(O). 
o 
Proof. Exhaust 0 = U K j , j 2: 1 by compact sets K j C K j+ 1 and define smooth 
functions j3j : 0 ~ ]R by setting j3j(x) = 0 if x E K j and j3j(x) = 1 if x E 0\Kj+1. 
Define j3 E Coo (0) by 
j3(X) = I: j3j(X) , 
x E O. 
j2':l 
Then j3(x) ----+ +00 as x ----+ ]R2\0. Now take a sequence bn ----+ 00 of regular values 
of j3 and consider the compact symplectic manifolds Dj = j3-1( -00, bj] having 
smooth boundaries. Then 0 = UDj,j 2: 1. Since Co has the property of inner 
regularity we conclude co(O) = lim co(Dj), as j ----+ 00. From the regularity of 
the Lebesgue measure we find, on the other hand, area (0) = lim 
area (Dj) 
as j ----+ 00. Since we already know that Co (D j) = area (D j ), the proposition is 
proved .• 
Although the invariant Co is defined by means of special periodic solutions, it 
is not at all surprising that in the 2-dimensional case it is intimately related to the 
area, since the symplectic form is the area form. In higher dimensions the capacity 
Co is, in contrast, not yet understood. It turns out that it is extremely difficult to 
compute this capacity. But some examples are known which are mentioned next. 
Theorem 5. Consider (!cpn, w) with the standard symplectic structure related to 
the Fubini-Study metric. Then 
Co (cpn , w) = 7r. 
This result is due to H. Hofer and C. Viterbo [122J. We do not give a proof 
here and remark that the proof analyzes the structure of the holomorphic spheres 
in cpn and is based on a Fredholm theory for first order elliptic systems. Now 
assume that (M, w) is any compact symplectic manifold without boundary, and 
denote by 7[2(M) the homotopy classes of maps u : 8 2 ----+ M. Then there is a map 
7[2 (M) ----+ ]R given by 
Uf----t(w,u) = Ju*w ER

- H. Hofer - C. Viterbo[88] and R. Ma [146] holds true. 
Theorem 6. Consider the symplectic manifold (M X 1R2n , W EEl wo) with n 2: 1 and 
assume a* = a*(M) > ° 
or a* = 00. Then 
provided 7rr2 < a*. 
The case of the symplectic torus T 2n will be discussed in the next chapter. 
Incidentally, by restricting the class of Hamiltonian functions admitted in 
the definition of Co (M, w), one finds different capacity functions. For example, 
if it(M,w) = {H E 1i(M,w)1 support of VH is contractible in M} and corre-
spondingly ita(M,w) = 1ia(M,w) nit(M,w), then we can define 
co (M,w) = sup {m(H) I HE ita(M,w)}. 
Our proof shows that Co is a capacity function; the related periodic solutions are 
all contractible. It clearly satisfies 
D(M,w) ~ CO(M,w) ~ co(M,w) 
where D(M,w) is the Gromov-width introduced in Chapter 1. 

Chapter 4 
Existence of closed characteristics 
In the previous chapter, the dynamical approach to the symplectic invariants led to 
the special capacity function Co. Its construction was based on a variational prin-
ciple for periodic solutions of certain Hamiltonian systems. The period of these 
periodic solutions was prescribed. In this chapter we shall deduce from this sym-
plectic invariant the existence of periodic solutions on prescribed energy surfaces. 
If we neglect the parametrization of such solutions the aim is to find closed charac-
teristics of a distinguished line bundle over a hypersurface in a symplectic manifold. 
It is determined by the symplectic structure, as explained in the introduction. A 
very special symplectic structure on the torus will lead us to M. Herman's coun-
terexample to the closing lemma in the smooth category. 
4.1 
Periodic solutions on energy surfaces 
The flow i.pt of a Hamiltonian vector field 
(4.1) 
on a symplectic manifold (M, w) leaves the level sets of the smooth function H on 
M invariant, i.e., H(i.pt(x)) = H(x) as long as t is defined. Fixing a value of this 
energy function which we can assume to be E = 1, we shall require the subset 
(4.2) 
to be compact and a regular, i.e., 
(4.3) 
dH(x) =f. 0 for 
xES. 
Thus ScM is a smooth and compact sub manifold of co dimension 1 whose tangent 
space at xES is given by 
(4.4) 
By the definition of a Hamiltonian vector field we have XH(X) E TxS so that X H is 
a nonvanishing vector field on S whose flow exists for all times since S is compact. 
Our aim is to find a periodic solution for X H on the energy surface S. This is a 
qualitative existence problem described in the introduction. 
In order to illustrate the method employed we start with a preliminary result. 
The trick is to thicken the given energy surface S and to consider a I-parameter 
105 

106 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
family of surfaces parameterized by the energy. Since S is compact and regular 
there is an open and bounded neighborhood U of S which is filled with compact 
and regular energy surfaces having energy values near E = 1: 
(4.5) 
U = USA, 
AEI 
where I is an open interval around A = 1 and where SA = {x E U I H(x) = A} 
is diffeomorphic to the given surface S, which corresponds to the parameter value 
A = 1. Indeed, take any Riemannian metric on M, then the gradient of H with 
respect to this metric does not vanish, V' H i- 0, in a neighborhood of S, in view 
of (4.3). We can, therefore, define the modified gradient vector field 
V'H(x) 
IV'H(x)12 
near S, which is transversal to S. Its flow 'lj;t satisfies 
for xES and, therefore, defines a diffeomorphism (x, t) t---+ 'lj;t(x) from S x (-c:, c:) 
onto an open neighborhood U of S as claimed. 
Theorem 1. (Hofer-Zehnder) Let S be a compact and regular energy surface for the 
Hamiltonian vector field X H on (M, w). Assume there is an open neighborhood 
U of S having bounded capacity: Co (U, w) < 00. Then there exists a sequence 
Aj -+ 1 of energy values, such that XH possesses a periodic solution on every 
energy surface SAj. 
Actually, the proof establishes more solutions: 
Corollary. There is a dense subset ~ c I such that for A E ~ the energy surface 
SA has a periodic solution of X H , provided co(U, w) < 00. 
It should be emphasized that there are no assumptions required for the given 
regular and compact energy surface S other than that a bounded open neighbor-
hood must have finite capacity. For example, in the special case of the standard 
symplectic manifold (]R2n, wo) a bounded set U is contained in a large ball B(R) 
and, consequently, by the monotonicity of the capacity, always has finite capacity. 
Hence every compact regular energy surface S C ]R2n gives rise to an abundance 
of periodic solutions for the Hamiltonian vector fields X H having energies near the 
prescribed energy. 
Proof. The statement is an immediate consequence of the definition of the spe-
cial capacity Co if we recall from the introduction that we have the freedom to 
choose a convenient Hamiltonian function representing the energy surfaces. We 
shall construct an auxiliary Hamiltonian function F on U which is constant on 

4.1 PERIODIC SOLUTIONS ON ENERGY SURFACES

every surface SA contained in U and which, in addition, belongs to the set 'H(U,w) 
of functions defined in the previous chapter. 
If I = {I - p < A < 1 + p} for some p > 0 we pick an c: in 0 < c: < p. Since, by 
assumption, co(U,w) < 00 we can choose a smooth function f : lR ~ lR satisfying:

Define F : U -+ lR by

Then F E '/i(U,w) and m(F) > eo(U,w). Consequently, in view of the definition 
of the capacity eo (U, w) there exists a nonconstant periodic solution x( t) having 
period 0 < T ~ 1 of the Hamiltonian system: 
± = Xp(x) , 
x E U. 
In view of the definition of a Hamiltonian vector field w(Xp(x),· ) = -dF(x) = 
- J'(H(x)) dH(x) = w(f'(H(x))XH(x),· ) and, therefore, 
Xp(x) = J'(H(x)) ,XH(X) ,

Moreover, 
H(x(t)) = >. 
is constant in t, since It H(x(t)) = dH(x(t)) ·±(t) = J'(H) 'W(XH' X H) = O. Since 
x(t) is not a constant solution we conclude 
Thus, in view of the definition of the function J, the value >. belongs to the set 
1- e < A < 1- ~ or 1 + ~ < A < 1 +e. In particular I>' -11 < e. Reparameterizing, 
we define the closed curve y : lR -+ SA by 
y(t) = x(~) 
which has period rT and satisfies 
hence is a periodic solution of the original Hamiltonian vector field X H on the 
energy surface H(y(t)) = >.. Moreover, I>' -11 < c. Since c is arbitrary the theorem 
is proved. Replacing>. = 1 by any other value of >. in the interval I we have proved, 
by the same argument, also the corollary .• 
One has to keep in mind that the periodic solutions guaranteed by Theorem 1 
are very special. They are indeed found indirectly by a special variational principle 
hidden in the construction of the symplectic invariant Co and there may exist many 
other periodic solutions. Moreover, the periodic solutions do not necessarily lie on 
the given energy surface S for X H but only nearby. However, if we know in addition, 
that the periods Tj of the periodic solutions Xj on SAj for X H are bounded, we 
can conclude that S too has a periodic solution. This simple observation will be

very useful later on. To be precise we choose a Riemannian metric g on M and 
abbreviate g(x)(~,T]) = (~,T]) and g(x)(~,~) = 1~12. If x(t) is a periodic solution of 
period T we can introduce its length by

l(x) = J Ix(t)1 dt.

Possibly after shrinking the open neighborhood U, we may assume 
for a constant C > O. Since the Xj(t) solve the Hamiltonian equations Xj(t) 
XH(Xj(t)) we conclude

Proposition 1. Let Aj --+ 1 and assume that the periods Tj (or equivalently the 
lengths l(xj)) of the periodic solutions Xj(t) on SAj are bounded. Then S = Sl 
possesses a periodic solution of X H . 
Proof. Normalizing the periods to 1 we define Yj(t) = xj(Tj . t) for 0 S t S 1, so 
that 
and H(Yj(t)) = Aj. Since, by assumption, the right hand side is bounded, we 
find by means of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem a subsequence such that Tj --+ T and 
Yj --+ Y with convergence, at first in Co, and, by making use of the equation, in 
Coo. The function Y : [0,1] --+ U is periodic with period 1, satisfies H(y(t)) = 1, 
and 
and is thus the desired periodic solution if T i=- O. Arguing by contradiction, we as-
sume T = O. Then Yj --+ {Y*} shrinks to a point y* and XH(y(t)) --+ XH(Y*) = V. 
Since the energy surface S is regular, Vi=- O. We can estimate in local coordinates 
near the point y*; 
for some small E > 0 and all j sufficiently large, so that 
Integrating over the period we conclude V = 0 contradicting V i=- 0 and proving 
the proposition .• 
Having established the existence of periodic solutions of a Hamiltonian vector 
field X H, it is useful to remember that, in general, a periodic solution belongs to a 

110 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
whole family of periodic solutions parameterized by the energy. This will be proved 
by the so-called Poincare continuation method. This local technique is based on the 
implicit function theorem and requires some knowledge of the Floquet multipliers 
of a given reference solution. 
Consider a periodic solution x(t) = x(t, E*) of XH having energy E* = H(x(t)) 
and period T = T*. Since the vector field X H is time independent one of the 
Floquet multipliers of x(t) must be equal to 1. Indeed, abbreviating x = x(O) we 
can differentiate the flow <pt 0 <ps (x) = <ps 0 <pt (x) in s at s = 0 and obtain 
for all t. If t = T is the period and hence <pT (x) = x we obtain 
d<pT(x) X H (x) = XH (x) 
E TxM. 
By definition, the eigenvalues of the linear map d<pT (x) : TxM ---+ TxM are the 
Floquet multipliers of the periodic solution x(t) and we have just verified that 1 
is always a Floquet multiplier. But since d<pT (x) is a symplectic linear map, the 
eigenvalue 1 has necessarily even multiplicity, so that x(t) possesses always at least 
two-Floquet multipliers equal to 1. Actually we shall verify this during the proof 
of the following proposition which was known to H. Poincare. 
Proposition 2. Assume a periodic solution x(t, E*) of X H on M having energy 
E* = H(x(t, E*)) and period T* has exactly two Floquet multipliers equal to 
1. Then there exists a unique and smooth I-parameter family x(t, E) of periodic 
solutions with periods T(E) close to T* and lying on the energy surfaces 
for IE - E*I sufficiently small. Moreover, T(E) ---+ T(E*) as E ---+ E*. 
Postponing the proof we observe that the reference solution x(t, E*) is not 
isolated in M as a periodic solution. The periodic solutions x(t, E) correspond to 
different values of E and it will turn out in the proof that, on the fixed energy 
surface E, this solution is isolated among those periodic solutions having peri-
ods close to T. Geometrically, the periodic solutions x(t, E) fill out an embedded 
cylinder in M as illustrated in the following figure 4.3. 
Proof of Proposition 2. It is useful to recall the construction of a transversal section 
map belonging to a periodic solution. Assume x(t) to be a nonconstant periodic 
solution of a vector field X on M and denote by T > 0 its period. Then, we can 
intersect x(t) at the point p = x(O) with a (2n - 1) dimensional hypersurface, 
i.e., a local submanifold ~ c M with codim ~ = 1 to which the vector field X is 
nowhere tangential. This means that Tx~ and X(x) span the tangent space TxM 
for every x E ~ near p: 
TxM = Tx~ EB (X(x)) , 
x E ~. 

4.1 PERIODIC SOLUTIONS ON ENERGY SURFACES

Fig. 4.3 
If ept denotes the flow of X then epT (p) = P E I:. Since the flow depends differen-
tiably on x we can define a smooth map 'ljJ : I: ----+ I: locally near p by following an 
initial point x E I: along its solution ept(x) until it meets I: again, i.e., 
'ljJ(x) = epT(X) (x), 
x E I:. 
Here T = T(X) is close to T > 0 and uniquely determined so that epT(X) E I:. 
Clearly 'ljJ(p) = p. This map 'ljJ is called the Poincare section map of the periodic 
solution x(t). It is important for us to know the eigenvalues of the linearized map 
at the fixed point p E I:. The relation of these eigenvalues to the Floquet multipliers 
of x(t), i.e., the eigenvalues of depT(p) 
depT (p) : TpM ----+ TpM 
is given by the following 
Lemma 1. depT (p) has 1 as an eigenvalue with eigenvector X (p) and the remaining 
eigenvalues are those of d'ljJ(p): i.e., the characteristic polynomials are related by 
Proof. We have already verified the first part of the lemma. Differentiating 'ljJ at p, 
we obtain for ~ E TpI: 
d'ljJ(p)~ 
depT(p)~ + ftept It=T . dT(p)~ 
depT(p)~ 
A(~)X(p), 
where we have abbreviated the linear form dT(p)~ by -A(~). With respect to 
the splitting TpM = (X(p)) EB TpI:, the linear map depT(p) has, therefore, the 

112 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
representation 
dcpT(p) = (~), 
o I d'¢(p) 
from which the lemma follows immediately .• 
Evidently the fixed points of '¢ near p are the initial conditions of all the 
periodic solutions near the reference solutions x(t) which have periods near T. 
We shall use this observation in order to prove Proposition 2. Let x(t) be the 
periodic solution of the proposition. Then H(x(t)) = E* and dH(x) #- 0 for x 
near x(t). Moreover, dH(XH ) = O. We can, therefore, introduce near p = x(O) 
convenient local coordinates (Xl, ... , X2n) E ]R2n such that p corresponds to x* = 
(E*, 0, ... ,0) and such that H(Xl, ... , X2n) = Xl and moreover, such that X2n = 0 
is a local transversal section E. In view of H(cpt(x)) = H(x) the section map '¢ is, 
in these coordinates expressed by 
'¢ : ( x' ) ~ 
( '¢/(X',X") = x' ) . 
x" 
'¢" (x', x") 
where the coordinates (x', x") E E stand for x' = Xl and x" = (X2, ... , X2n-d. 
The aim is to find the fixed points of '¢ near x*. In order to do this we only have 
to solve the equation 
'¢" (x' ,x") = x", 
since the first equation '¢' (x', x") = x' is automatically satisfied. Since, by as-
sumption, '¢( x*) = x* is a reference solution, we can apply the implicit function 
theorem, observing that in our coordinates the linearized map is expressed by 
~ 
.I·"(X*) 
ax" t.p 
d,p(x') ~ (

o ) 
Recalling the assumption of Proposition 2 and Lemma 1, the matrix 
a=" '¢" (x*) -
1l2n- 2 
is nonsingular. Therefore, there exists a unique map x' ~ x" = a(x') solving 
the equation '¢"(x', a(x')) = a(x' ). Thus x' = E and x" = a(E) are the initial 
conditions on E of the desired periodic solutions satisfying Proposition 2 .• 
One is tempted to apply Proposition 2 to the periodic solutions on SAj guar-
anteed by Theorem 1 in order to establish the existence of a periodic solution 
on the given energy surface S as Aj ~ o. But unfortunately nothing can be said 
about the Floquet multipliers of these solutions. In addition, Proposition 2 is of 
a local nature: globally the cylinder of periodic solutions may eventually become 
tangential to an energy surface. This situation has been studied by C. Robinson 
in [183], 1970. 

4.2 THE CHARACTERISTIC LINE BUNDLE OF A HYPERSURFACE 
113 
4.2 The characteristic line bundle of a hypersurface 
The search for periodic orbits of a Hamiltonian vector field lying on a prescribed 
energy surface S is independent of the choice of the Hamiltonian representing S: 
it only depends on the submanifold S and the symplectic structure w. Indeed, as 
explained in Chapter 1, this dynamical problem can be described geometrically. 
We consider a submanifold ScM of codimension 1, i.e., a hypersurface of the 
symplectic manifold (M,w). Then the symplectic structure wand S determine a 
distinguished line bunde L8 C TS, as follows. If xES, then restriction of the 
2-form w to the odd-dimensional subspace TxS C TxM is necessarily degenerate. 
The kernel of this restriction if of dimension 1, because w is nondegenerate on 
TxM, and hence defines a line bundle, L8 C TS, 
This line bundle gives the direction of every Hamiltonian vector field having S as 
a regular energy surface. 
Proposition 3. Assume the smooth function H represents S as S = {xIH(x) = 
const} and satisfies dH t- 0 on S. Then 
XH(X) E L8(X) for all xES. 
Proof. Since the tangent space is given by TxS = {~ E TxMldH(x)~ = O} we have 
W(XH(X),~) = -dH(x)~ = 0 for all ~ E TxS .• 
Notation. The bundle L8 is called the characteristic line bundle of the hypersurface 
S. A closed characteristic of S, or a periodic Hamiltonian orbit of S, is an embedded 
circle PeS satisfying 
TP=L8Ip· 
In the following we shall denote the set of closed characteristics of S by 
P(S). 
It agrees with the set of unparameterized periodic solutions of every Hamiltonian 
vector field X H on Shaving S as a regular energy surface. 
Assume now that L8 ----t Sis orientable, i.e., the bundle possesses a nonvanish-
ing section. We shall show that there exists a Hamiltonian function H : U ----t lR. 
defined on a neighborhood of S and representing S = H-1(O) as a regular energy 
surface. We make use of an almost complex structure on M compatible with w, 
i.e., a smooth family of linear maps J(x) E L(TxM),x E M, satisfying J2 = -ll 
and 
w(x)(~,J(x)ry) = g(x) (Cry) 

114 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
for all ~,1] E TxM, with a Riemannian metric g. If Ns -+ S is the normal bundle 
of S whose fibre at xES is defined by 
we have the bundle isomorphism 
This map is indeed well-defined and injective on each fibre: if w(~, 1]) = ° for 
all 1] E TxS then g(1], J~) = w(1], J2~) = -w(1],~) = 0. The normal bundle Ns is 
orient able since LS is orientable. Therefore, N sand S x lR are isomorphic as vector 
bundles. Taking a nonvanishing section a of Ns, so that ° 
i=- a(x) E Ns(x) c TxM 
we can define the map 
'Ij; : S x (-c;, c;) -+ U c M 
by means ofthe exponential map (x, t) f-+ expx(ta(x)). It is a diffeomorphism onto 
an open neighborhood U of S if S is compact and c; sufficiently small. If 
F : S x (-c;, c;) -+ lR 
is the smooth function F(x, t) = t, then the composition H = F 0 'Ij;-l : U -+ lR is 
the desired Hamiltonian; it satisfies S = H-1(O) and dH i=- 0 as claimed. 
Definition. Let S be a compact hypersurface in (M, w). A parameterized family of 
hypersurfaces modelled on S is a diffeomorphism 
'Ij; : S x I -+ U c M, 
I being an open interval containing 0, onto a bounded neighborhood U of S sat-
isfying 
'Ij;(x,O) = x 
for xES. 
We shall abbreviate in the following SE: = 'Ij;( S x {c;}) and later on we often simply 
write (SE:) instead of 'Ij;. 
We remark that the following statements are equivalent: (i) The line bundle 
Ls -+ S is orient able. (ii) The normal bundle Ns -+ S is orientable. (iii) S is 
orientable. (iv) There exists a parameterized family of hypersurfaces modelled 
on S. (v) There exists a smooth function H E Coo (U, lR) defined on an open 
neighborhood U of S representing S = {x E UIH(x) = const.} and satisfying 
dH i=- 0. Using these concepts we can reformulate Theorem 1 of the previous 
section as follows: 

4.2 THE CHARACTERISTIC LINE BUNDLE OF A HYPERSURFACE 
115 
Theorem 2. (Hofer-Zehnder) Let B be a compact hypersurface in (M,w) and let 
(Be:) be a parameterized family of hypersurfaces modelled on B. If eo(U,w) < 00, 
then there exists a dense set ~ C I such that 
P(Be:) i= 0 for 
c: E ~ 
In order to find closed characteristics on the hypersurface B and not merely 
close by we shall now restrict the class of hypersurfaces under consideration. We 
assume that B is the boundary of a compact symplectic manifold (B, w) c (M, w), 
i.e., aB = B. 
Fig. 4.4 
Then if (Be:) is a parameterized family modelled on B we have Be: = aBe:, for 
symplectic manifolds Be: and we assume the parametrization to be chosen such 
that 
Be: c Be:l 
if 
c: ~ c:/. 
In view of the monotonicity property of a capacity we then have 
so that the function 
is monotone increasing. 
Definition. The hypersurface Be:- is called of eo-Lipschitz type if there are positive 
constants L and M such that 
C(c:) ~ C(c:*) + L(c: - c:*) 
for every c: in the interval c:* ~ c: ~ c:* + M. 
Using the monotonicity property of Co one verifies easily that the definition 
does not depend on the choice of the family Be: modelled on Be:-. We illustrate the 
concept by an example. Let B = aB be the boundary of the compact manifold B 
and assume there exists a vector field X in a neighborhood of B satisfying 
(i) 
Lxw = w 
(ii) 
X(x) f/- TxB if x E B .

The flow <pt of X defines a distinguished parameterized family of hypersurfaces 
modelled on S by 
1/J(x, t) = <pt(x) , xES. 
for It I sufficiently small. From Lxw = w one deduces (<pt)*w = etw. Defining Bt := 
<pt(B) the map <pt : (B,w) -+ (Bt, e-tw) is, therefore, symplectic and using the 
invariance and conformality of Co we find e-tco(Bt,w) = co(Bt,e-tw) = co(B,w) 
so that 
eo(Bt,w) = et eo(B,w). 
The function O(t) = eo(Bt,w) is differentiable at t = 0 and thus we have verified 
that S is of Co- Lipschitz type. 
Theorem 3. Assume eo(M,w) < 00. If the compact hypersurface ScM bounds a 
symplectic manifold and is, moreover, of eo-Lipschitz type then 
P(S) =I 0.

Since m(F) > eo(Bnw) = C(T) we deduce from the definition of the capacity 
function Co a nonconstant periodic solution x(t) having period 0 < T ::; 1 of the 
Hamiltonian system 
By construction this solution cannot be contained in Bo, since the restriction of F 
onto Bo is an admissible function, and Bo being invariant under the flow of X F , 
the solution x(t) must be contained in Br \Bo. As the solution is not constant we 
find by the properties of f an c in 0 < c < ~ such that 
x(t) C Se. 
This argument works for every T > 0, and choosing a sequence Tj --t 0 we thus 
find sequences Fj and Cj and a corresponding sequence Xj(t) of periodic orbits of 
X Fj satisfying

independent of j. Define on

surfaces by setting

and K(Yj(t)) = Ej. 
The crucial observation now is that the periods of Yj are given by I' (E j) . Tj 
and hence, in view of J' (E j) ::::: lOM, the periods are bounded. By Proposition 
1 we, therefore, conclude that there exists a periodic solution x(t) of X K on the 
energy surface K(x) = 0 which is the hypersurface S = So. This periodic solution 
parameterizes the desired closed characteristic on S .• 
Recall now that the function C(E) = CO(BE'W) defined above is monotone. By 
a theorem due to Lebesgue it is, therefore, differentiable almost everywhere and 
thus Lipschitz continuous almost everywhere and we deduce from Theorem 3 
Theorem 4. Assume the hypersurface S C (M,w) bounds a compact symplectic 
manifold. lf (SE) with EEl is a parameterized family of hypersurfaces modelled 
on S, then (m denoting Lebesgue measure) 
provided co(M,w) < 00. 
A compact and connected hypersurface S C JR2n separates the space into a 
bounded and an unbounded component. (Indeed, every compact smooth hyper-
surface M C JRTn is orientable; the statement follows from the Jordan-Brouwer 
separation theorem, we refer to E. Lima [142] for a short differential geometric 
proof in the smooth case.)We, therefore, conclude for the special case of hypersur-
faces in the standard symplectic manifold (JR2n , wo) the

119 
Corollary. For every compact hypersurface S C (JR2n ,wo) and every parameterized 
family (Se), EEl, of hypersurfaces modelled on S 
This result was first proved by M. Struwe in [207] who cleverly modified the 
proof by H. Hofer and E. Zehnder in [123] of the weaker statement that P(Se) i=- 0 
for a dense set of E in I. As an illustration we take a smooth function HE Cgo(JR2n ), 
i.e., having compact support. Then the set of critical levels is compact in JR and, 
moreover, by Sard's theorem of measure zero. Consequently, for almost every h in 
minH < h < maxH 
there exists a nonconstant periodic solution Xh(t) of the Hamiltonian vector field 
X H having energy H(Xh(t)) = h. This is a local analogue to a recent result due to 
C. Viterbo [218] for mappings instead of vector fields. It states that a symplectic 
diffeomorphism r.p of (JR2n, wo) which is the identity map outside a compact set 
K C JR2n possesses infinitely many periodic orbits contained in K. We should 
mention that C. Viterbo also deduced his result from the existence of a symplectic 
invariant for subsets in (JR2n , wo) whose relation to the capacity Co is so far not 
understood. 
4.3 
Hypersurfaces of contact type, the Weinstein conjecture 
We next single out another symplectic property of a hypersurface which guarantees 
the existence of a closed characteristic. Prompted by the first global results for 
convex and star-like energy surfaces in 1R2n , A. Weinstein introduced in [226] the 
following concept: 
Definition. A compact and orientable hypersurface ScM in the symplectic man-
ifold (M, w) is called of contact type if there exists a I-form a on S satisfying 
(i) 
da 
j*w 
(ii) 
a(~) 
i=-
0 
for 
0 i=- ~ E 'cs , 
where j : S ---- M is the inclusion map and 'cs is the canonical line bundle of S. 
Since ~ E 'cs is in the kernel of wlS and a(~) i=- 0, the kernel of a, given 
by kera(x) = {17 E TxS I axCT}) = O}, is a (2n - 2)-dimensional subspace of TxS 
on which the 2-form w, and hence also da is nondegenerate. Consequently, a 1\ 
(da)n-l is a volume form on S. Geometrically the I-form a defines a smooth 
field of hyperplanes on S which is an example of a contact structure on the odd-
dimensional manifold S. 

120 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
A. Weinstein conjecture (1978): A hypersurface S of contact type and satisfying 
HI (S) = 0 carries a closed characteristic. 
We shall verify the conjecture without the topological assumption HI (S) = 0 
but under the symplectic assumption that S has a neighborhood U C M of finite 
capacity: co(U,w) < 00. We first reformulate the concept of contact type following 
A. Weinstein [226]. 
Proposition 4. A compact hypersurface ScM is of contact type if and only if 
there exists a vector field X, defined on a neighborhood U of S, satisfying 
(i) 
Lxw 
w 
on U. 
(ii) 
X(x) 
(j: 
TxS 
if xES. 
i.e., X is transversal to S. 
In order to prove the proposition we start with a Poincare-type lemma. 
Lemma 2. Let 7r: E ~ N be a vector bundle and let a be a closed k-form on E 
satisfying j*a = 0, where the inclusion map j : N ~ E is the zero section of the 
bundle. Then there exists a (k - I)-form (J on E satisfying 
a = d(J 
and (JIN = o. 
Proof. Using the linear structure of the fibers we can define, for t > 0, the con-
traction maps cpt : E ~ E along the fibers by multiplication: cpt(x) = t· x. 
With X t we denote the time-dependent vector field on E generated by the fam-
ily of diffeomorphisms as usual by 1£ cpt (x) = X t ( cpt (x» if t > O. If we define 
X1(x) = It cpt(X)lt=1 E TxE we have the representation Xt(x) = tXl(X). More-
over, Xt(x) = 0 if x E N. Using da = 0 we find by Cartan's formula 
:t (cpt)* a = (cpt)* Lx,a = d {(CPt)*ix,a}, 
where 
(cpt)*ix,a(x) = a(t.x)GdcptXI(x),dcpt.). 
Because lim(cpt)*a = 7r*j*a = 0 and cpl(X) = x we conclude that 
t-+O

(cpl)*a -lim (cpt)*a

d J (cpt)*ix,a) dt = d(J 
o 
for a smooth (k - I)-form (J on E. If x E N, then Xt(x) = 0 and hence ix,a = 0 
so that (J(x) = o. This finishes the proof of the lemma .• 
We shall use the lemma to extend the I-form a on S to an open neighborhood 
of S. 

4.3 HYPERSURFACES OF CONTACT TYPE, THE WEINSTEIN CONJECTURE 
121 
Lemma 3. If S c (M,w) is of contact type then there exists a I-form T on a 
neighborhood U of S satisfying 
(i) 
(ii) 
w on U 
a 
on S 
where j : S -+ U is the inclusion mapping. 
Proof. Since S is compact and oriented there exists a diffeomorphism 'ljJ : S x 
( -1, 1) -+ U onto an open neighborhood U of S satisfying 'ljJ (x, 0) = x for all 
xES. This has been proved in the previous section. The projection map (x, t) f--4 X 
from S x (-1, 1) onto S induces, therefore, a smooth map r : U -+ S which is the 
identity on S. Define the I-form fl on U by fl = r*a. Then j*fl = j*r*a = a. We 
now consider the 2-form w - dfl on U. Then 
d(w-dfl) = dw = 0, 
since a symplectic structure is a closed form. Moreover, using that j*w = da 
j*(w-dfl) = da-d(j*fl) = da-da = O. 
Since U is diffeomorphic to S x (-1,1), which in turn is isomorphic to the bundle 
S x JR, we can apply Lemma 2 to the 2-form w - dfl and find a I-form 1J on U 
satisfying w - dfl = d1J and j*1J = O. Consequently, if we define the I-form T on 
U by T = fl + 1J we find dT = d(fl + 1J) = wand j*T = j* fl ,= a as desired in the 
lemma .• 
We are now ready to prove Proposition 4. Assume ScM is of contact type. 
Then taking the I-form T of Lemma 3 we can define the vector field X on U by 
ixw = T 
on 
U. 
This vector field has the desired properties of the proposition. Indeed, by Lemma 
3, w = dT = d(ixw) = -ix(dw) + Lxw = Lxw and it remains to show that X is 
transversal to S. If 0 =J ~ E LS(X) then 
by the assumption on a. Since ~, by definition belongs to the kernel of w restricted 
to the tangent space TxS we conclude that X(x) ~ TxS. 
Conversely, if the vector field X meets the assumption (i) and (ii) of the propo-
sition we define the I-form a on U by 
a = ixw. 
Then da = d(ixw) = Lxw = w, and from the transversality condition X(x) ~ TxS 
we conclude 0 =J w (X(x), ~) = a(~) for 0 =J ~ E LS(X). We have verified, with 
this I-form a, that S is of contact type. This finishes the proof of the proposition .• 

122 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
The significance of the property of S being of contact type lies in the fact that S 
admits a distinguished parameterized family (Sf:) of hypersurfaces modelled on S. 
It is defined by the flow <pt of the special vector field X guaranteed by Proposition 
4. Since S is compact and X is transversal to S, the map 
1/J : S x (-c, c) -+ U c M 
defined by 1/J(x, t) = <pt(x) for xES and It I < c is a diffeomorphism onto an 
open neighborhood U of S provided c > 0 is sufficiently small. From Lxw = w we 
conclude -9t(<pt)*w = (rt:,t) * Lxw = (<pt)*w. Hence in view of <po = id, 
(<pt)*w = etw. 
Assume now that e E .cs(x), then for all 'Tl E TxS 
is an isomorphism of vector bundles. Therefore, <pt induces a one-to-one correspon-
dence 
P(S) +---+ P(St) 
of the closed characteristics by P I---J. <pt (P). This leads us to the following definition: 
Definition. A compact hypersurface S c (M,w) is called stable if there exists a 
parameterized family (Sf:) modelled on S having the following additional property: 
the associated diffeomorphism 1/J: S x (-1,1) -+ U induces bundle isomorphisms 
for every c E (-1,1). 
A hypersurface of contact type is stable as we have just proved. A stable hyper-
surface need, however, not be of contact type as the following example illustrates. 
Consider the symplectic manifold M = N X ]R2 with the symplectic structure 
w = WI EB wo, where (N, WI) is a compact symplectic manifold without boundary. 
Consider the hypersurface 
S = N x {lzl2 = I} c M 
and define the parametrization 1/J : S x (-1,1) -+ M by setting 1/J((x,z),c) 
(x, cz), so that Sf: = N X {lzl2 = c2}. Evidently S is stable but S is not of contact 
type. Otherwise we find a I-form 0 on S satisfying do = j*w, with the inclusion 
j : S -+ M. Denoting by i : N -+ N x {(I, On the inclusion of N in S we infer 

4.3 HYPERSURFACES OF CONTACT TYPE, THE WEINSTEIN CONJECTURE 
123 
that i*(da) = i*j*w = Wl. Consequently, the symplectic form Wl = d(i*a) must 
be exact. This, however, is not possible. Indeed, by Stokes' theorem 
vol (N) = J 
Wl 1\ ... 1\ Wl = 0, 
N 
hence w~n) is not a volume form and thus Wl is degenerate, contradicting the 
assumption that Wl is a symplectic form. 
A stable hypersurface S admits, by definition, a parameterized family (Se:) 
having the following property: if P(Se:) :I 0 for a single c E (-1,1) then P(S) :I 0. 
Consequently, we deduce from Theorem 2 the following global existence statement: 
Theorem 5. Assume the compact hypersurface S C (M,w) admits a neighborhood 
U of finite capacity: co(U,w) < 00. If S is, in addition, stable, then 
P(S) :I 0. 
In particular, if S is of contact type, then P(S) :I O. 
A compact hypersurface in (]R2n, wo) always possesses a bounded neighborhood 
of finite capacity Co and we deduce from Theorem 5 the celebrated solution of A. 
Weinstein's conjecture due to C. Viterbo [217] in 1987. For another proof we 
mention [45], 1988. 
Theorem 6. (C. Viterbo) Every compact hypersurface S C (]R2n, wo) of contact 
type carries a closed characteristic. 
In contrast to the Weinstein conjecture for general symplectic manifolds (M, w), 
the condition that Hl(S) = 0 is not required here. An example is a compact 
hypersurface S C ]R2n which is star-like with respect to an interior point we may 
assumed to be the origin in ]R2n (Fig.4.7). 
Denote by X(x) = !x the dilatation, then, by definition of star-like 
X(x) ~ TxS, xES. 
Moreover, the flow <pt of X satisfies 
(<pt)*wo 
etwo, 
so that in view of the proposition this hypersurface S is of contact type. In par-
ticular, a smooth hypersurface bounding a compact and convex domain in ]R2n 
is star-like. Thus convex and star-like hypersurfaces in (]R2n, wo) always carry a 
periodic Hamiltonian orbit and we have confirmed the pioneering results due to A. 
Weinstein [225] and P. Rabinowitz [181] in 1978 which marked the beginning of the 
investigation of global phenomena of Hamiltonian systems in higher dimensions. 
We point out that by using the technique of attaching symplectic handlebodies, 
y. Eliashberg [72] and A. Weinstein [221] constructed many examples of hyper-
surfaces of contact type which are topologically intricate. Not every hypersurface 

124 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
Fig. 4.7 
is, of course, of contact type. We illustrate this by an example of a hypersurface S 
which is of co-Lipschitz type but not of contact type. Consider within the closure 
of the symplectic cylinder Z(R) C (lR2n , wo) a hypersurface which is diffeomorphic 
to the sphere indented, as in the following picture 
n(x) 
r 
rR 
Fig. 4.8 
Z(R) = {(x,y) E lR2n I xi + yi < R2}. 
Denoting by n(x) the outer normal at xES, we define by In(x) E TxS a smooth 
vector field on S which belongs to the characteristic line bundle, In(x) E .cs(x). 
Assume now, by contradiction, that S is of contact type. Then there exists a I-form 

4.3 HYPERSURFACES OF CONTACT TYPE, THE WEINSTEIN CONJECTURE 
125 
o near S satisfying do = Wo and either 
o(Jn(x)) > 0, 
for all xES 
or o(Jn(x)) < 0 for all xES. Without loss of generality we assume the first 
alternative to hold. Define the I-form A on ~2n by 
n 
A = L Yj dXj, 
j=1 
where (x,y) E ~2n. Then dA = Wo and, therefore, dA = do on S. Hence, in view 
of H1(S) = 0 we find a smooth function p : S ----+ ~ satisfying 0 
-
A = dp. 
Consequently, for every periodic solution "( of the vector field In on S, 
However, for the two distinguished periodic solutions "(R and "(r on the outer 
respectively inner cylinder, as depicted in the above figure, one finds 
This contradiction shows that S is not of contact type. Evidently, there is a pa-
rameterized family (SE) modelled on S for which co(BE,wo) = 7r(R + 10)2 agrees 
with the capacity of the cylinders, where SE = aBE. Therefore, S = So is of Co-
Lipschitz type. We remark that the argument above also shows that the actions of 
all periodic solutions on a compact energy surface S of contact type and satisfying 
H1(S) = 0 have all the same sign. In particular, the actions never vanish on such 
hypersurfaces. 
We conclude this section with a recent result in dimension 3, which is not 
obtained by the variational methods described so far. We consider a smooth closed 
and orientable manifold W of dimension 2n - 1. A contact form on W is a I-form 
A such that All (dA)n-1 is a volume form on W. Such a contact form determines a 
so-called contact structure which is the (2n - 2) dimensional plane field 6 defined 
by 
6 = Kern(A) C TW . 
Moreover, the kernel of dA is I-dimensional. Thus there exists a unique vector field 
X = X).. satisfying 
ix dA == 0 and ix A = 1. 
This distinguished non vanishing vector field on W is called the Reeb vector field 
associated to A. Note that we no longer require that W = aM and dA = wlM for 
a compact symplectic manifold (M, w) of dimension 2n. 

126 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
We shall say that the Weinstein conjecture holds true for the manifold W, if 
for every contact form A on W, the associated Reeb vector field X A has a closed 
orbit. 
Theorem 7. (H. Hofer) The Weinstein conjecture holds true for the three dimen-
sional sphere 8 3 . 
Actually the Weinstein conjecture holds true also for every closed orientable 
three manifold W 3 satisfying 7l"2(W3 ) =1= 0, see H. Hofer [118] (1993). The proof 
is based on first order elliptic partial differential equations of "Cauchy-Riemann" 
type and is influenced by Gromov's theory of pseudoholomorphic curves in sym-
plectic manifolds [107] and Eliashberg's outline of filling techniques using holo-
morphic discs [73]. 
We point out that there are many contact forms A on 8 3 , (namely the so-called 
overtwisted contact forms) which do not admit an embedding of 8 3 into JR4 such 
that the induced Hamiltonian flow is conjugated to the Reeb flow defined by X A• 
Here a contact form A on a closed three dimensional manifold W is called 
overtwisted by Eliashberg, if there exists an embedded disc F '::::' D2, where D2 = 
{z E <CJ Izl:::; I}, such that 
T(8F) c 618F 
TxF 
rt. 
6,x for all x E 8F . 
In the classical work of Lutz [144] and Martinet, [147] contact structures are es-
tablished in every compact orientable three-manifold. On 8 3 , in particular, there 
exist overtwisted contact structures which are not equivalent by a diffeomorphism 
(in the sense described below). 
A contact form A which is not overtwisted is called tight. By a deep classification 
result of Eliashberg [74] there is, up to diffeomorphisms however only one contact 
structure on 8 3 which is tight. More precisely, if AI, A2 are tight forms on 8 3 , then 
according to Eliashberg there exists a smooth function f : 8 3 ---> JR \ {O} and a 
diffeomorphism '¢ : 8 3 ---> 8 3 satisfying 
We shall show now that, for a tight contact structure on 8 3 , the associated Reeb 
vector field has a periodic solution. Represent 8 3 as the subset of C2 given by 
{(ZI,Z2)llzI12 + IZ212 = I}. Writing Zj = qj + ipj with qj,Pj E JR, we define the 
one-form AO on C2 by 
so that dAo = W00 Due to a fundamental result by Bennequin [20], the special 
contact form Aol83 is tight. Consequently, given any tight contact form A on 8 3 , 

4.4 "CLASSICAL" HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS 
127 
we find a nonvanishing function I : 8 3 -+ ]R \ {O} and a diffeomorphism 'If; of 8 3 
such that 
'If;* >. = I· (>'0183 ) . 
Hence the Reeb flows for>. and I· (>'0183 ) are conjugated. We can use this in order 
to prove that X>. has, in this special case, a periodic orbit. Since Xf>'o = -X-f>'o 
we may assume that I is positive. We claim that there is a smooth hypersurface 
8 C ((:2 bounding a star-shaped domain and a diffeomorphism 'If; : 8 3 -+ 8 such 
that 
T'If;(Cf>.o) = Cs, 
where C f >'0 is the line bundle of 8 3 defined by the Reeb vector field associated to 
1>'0, and where Cs is the canonical line field induced on the hypersurface 8 by 
the standard symplectic structure Wo in ((:2 ~ ]R4. Indeed, we simply define the 
hypersurface 8 by 
8 = hi I (z) z 1 z E 8 3 } C ((:2 
and the diffeomorphism 'If; : 8 3 -+ 8 by 'If;(z) = J I(z)z. Observing now that 
>'o(z) = !wo(z, .), z E ((:2 we abbreviate a = VI and compute, for z E 8 3 and 
hE Tz 8 3 , 
'If;*(>'018)(z;h) = !wo(a(z)z,(da(z)h)z+a(z)h) 
a(z)2 !wo(z, h) 
(f. >'o)(z, h) . 
From this, the claim follows. Using the existence result of P. Rabinowitz proved 
above, we conclude that the Reeb vector field Xf>.o has a periodic solution. 
To sum up, we have demonstrated that in the exceptional case of a tight contact 
structure>. on 8 3 , the associated Reeb vector field X).. possesses at least one closed 
orbit. 
4.4 "Classical" Hamiltonian systems 
The positions of a conservative system of n degrees of freedom are points in the 
so-called configuration space, which we assume to be an n-dimensional smooth 
manifold N. The motion of the system, in the setting of Lagrangian mechanics, 
is determined by a Lagrangian L defined on the tangent bundle TN of N. This 
2n-dimensional manifold is called the phase space of the system. In our setting of 
Hamiltonian mechanics, the motion of the system is determined by a Hamiltonian 
function H defined on the cotangent bundle T* N of N. This is the basic example of 
a symplectic manifold. It is equipped with a canonical symplectic structure which 
we shall recall first. 
If N is any manifold of dimension n, and ifTxN is the tangent space at x E N, 
we denote its dual space, the so called cotangent space by T; N. It is the space of 

128 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
linear forms defined on the vector space TxN. The union of all cotangent spaces 
is called the cotangent bundle of N and denoted by 
T*N = U T;N. 
xEN 
A point a in this set M = T* N is a linear form ax in the tangent space TxN at 
some point x EN, and we shall sometimes use the notation 
for a point in M. One can view T* N as a differentiable manifold of dimension 2n by 
introducing local coordinates, e.g., as follows. If (Xl, ... ,xn ) are local coordinates 
in N, a I-form a E T;N is represented by a = 2:,7=1 yjdxj having the coordinates 
(Y1, ... , Yn) and together (Xl' ... ' Xn, Y1, ... , Yn) form local coordinates in T* N. 
In these coordinates one can now define the special I-form >. on T* N by 
(4.7) 
n 
>. = Lyjdxj, 
j=l 
which has, so far only a local meaning. It is remarkable that the above form>. has 
a global interpretation on T* N. Since a point of T* N is represented by a I-form 
e at a point X E N we can form e(V) for every vector V E TxN. To define a 
one-form on T* N, say 13, one has to give its value f3(X) for every tangent vector 
X of T* N. If X is such a tangent vector at e E T* N, one can use the form e itself 
to define 
(4.8) 
>'e(X) = e(d7rX) , X E Te(T* N) 
as a linear functional. Here the projection 7r : T* N -+ N assigns to each e E T* N 
its base point x E N and, therefore, d7r maps the tangent space Te(T* N) at e 
onto the tangent space TxN at x. This I-form>. on T* N is sometimes called the 
tautological form on T* N since it is defined in terms of itself. It is readily verified 
that in the above local coordinates the form (4.8) agrees with the form (4.7). In 
view of the expression (4.7) we find 
n 
d>' = L 
dYj 1\ dXj 
j=l 
and conclude that, globally, w = d>' is a closed and nondegenerate 2-form on 
T* N, hence a symplectic form. It is called the canonical symplectic structure on 
T* N. The canonical I-form >. on T* N is called the Liouville form. As an aside, we 
observe that>. has the distinguished property that 
13* >. = 13 

4.4 "CLASSICAL" HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS-
129 
for every one-form (3 on N. Here the one-form (3 is regarded as a section (3 : N -> 
T* N. The proof follows from the observation that 7r 0 (3 = id on N. Considering 
the definition of A and using the chain rule, we find 
as claimed. Classical mechanical systems are described by Hamiltonian functions 
on (T* N, dA) given by a sum of kinetic energy and the potential energy. The 
kinetic energy is defined by a Riemannian metric k on the configuration space, 
which associates with every point x E N, a symmetric bilinearform kx(v, w) for 
v, wE TxN which is positive. This metric defines a bundle isomorphism "'/ : TN -> 
T* N by ",/(v)(w) = k(v,w) which induces the associated Riemannian metric K on 
the cotangent bundle T* N by 
The potential energy is represented by a smooth function V : N -> lR on the 
configuration space. On T* N the Hamiltonian H is now defined by 
(4.9) 
H(e) = K(e) + v (7r(e)), 
eET*N. 
In the above local coordinates we have the formulae: 
H

where K(x,y) = ~(S(x)y,y) with a positive definite matrix S(x). 
If e(t) is a solution of the Hamiltonian vector field X H contained in the invariant 
energy surface 
(4.11) 
S = {e I H = K + V = E}, 
then the geometric motion of the system in the configuration space is given by 
x(t) = 7r(e(t)) E N where 7r : T* N -> N is the projection. Since K 2: 0, it is 
confined in the subset 
( 4.12) 

130 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
If E < max V, this set is an n-dimensional manifold having the smooth boundary 
ONE = {V(x) = E} provided S is a regular energy surface. Indeed, where K = 0 
we also have tyK = 0 so that necessarily tx V(x) =I- 0 on V(x) = E. However 
if E > max V, then N E = N is the whole configuration space and K > 0 on S. 
Therefore A(XH ) = 2K > 0 on S and we see that S is a hypersurface of contact 
type whose contact structure is defined by means of the Liouville form A. If the 
capacity eo(U) is finite for a neighborhood U of Sin T* N we can conclude that S 
admits a closed characteristic. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the special 
capacity eo on cotangent bundles, except in the special case of the torus which will 
be treated later. 
Periodic solutions on S have been found by using geometrical ideas, as we shall 
briefly indicate next. Assuming that E > max V, we have 
T*NE = T*N 
and we can define the special Riemannian metric G on T* N by 
G(~) = 
K(~) 
,~E T*N. 
E - V( 7r(~)) 
It is the so-called Jacobi metric. We have now two Hamiltonian functions, namely 
Hand G, which describe S as the regular energy surface 
The corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields are, therefore, parallel, XH = pXc on 
S, with a nonvanishing function p defined on S which is actually easily computed 
in local coordinates. One finds that 
XH = K·Xc on 
S. 
Consequently, the vector fields X H and Xc have, on S, the same orbits up to 
reparametrization. Geometrically, the vector field Xc generates the geodesic flow 
defined by the Riemannian metric G on T* N. The projection 7r(~(t)) of a flow line 
is a geodesic line in the configuration space N, i.e., it locally minimizes the length 
between two points, where the length is measured with respect to the metric 9 on 
TN given by 
gx(v,w) = (E_V(X))-lkx(v,w), 
with v,wETxN. 
We see that the geodesics for the Riemannian metric G on T* N agree, up to 
reparametrization, with the solutions of the Hamiltonian vector field X H on S. This 
holds true, of course, only on the distinguished energy surface S. This fact is known 
as the Euler-Maupertuis-Jacobi principle. It reduces the dynamical problem of 

4.4 "CLASSICAL" HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS 
131 
finding solutions for the Hamiltonian vector field on 8 to the geometrical problem 
of finding geodesics for the Jacobi metric on N, a problem with a rich history. 
Recall that if N is not simply connected, e.g., a torus, one can consider the 
family of closed curves in a nontrivial homotopy class and obtain a closed geodesic 
of shortest length. This was already known to Hadamard 1889. Technically this 
approach requires that the length functional on the subspace of loops attains its 
minimum, an analytical problem which was clearly seen and attacked by D. Hilbert 
(1890), see [112]. To find closed geodesics on a Riemannian manifold N which is 
simply connected is a difficult and interesting task. In this case the geodesics cannot 
be found as minima but rather as saddle points of the length functional using the 
topology of the loop space of the underlying manifold N. G. Birkhoff established 
a closed geodesic on the two-spheres using a minimax principle which later led to 
the Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory for critical points. The Morse theory developed 
at roughly the same time had its origin in the existence problem of geodesics. 
Extending Birkhoff's idea to higher dimensions, Ljusternik and Fet proved in 1951 
[81] that every compact Riemannian manifold (N,g) possesses a closed geodesic. 
From this geometrical result one deduces immediately by taking the Jacobi metric 
that the energy surface 8 above possesses a closed characteristic, provided N is 
compact and E > max V. 
In the case that E < max V the theory of closed geodesics is not applicable 
directly, since now the manifold N E has a boundary ONE where the Jacobi met-
ric blows up. Despite this analytical difficulty, S.V. Bolotin [29] 1978 used the 
geometrical approach successfully in order to prove: 
Theorem 6. Let N be any smooth manifold and assume H : T* N -+ lR describes a 
classical system of the form (4.9). Then every compact and regular energy surface 
8 E possess a periodic solution of X H . 
This theorem extends an earlier result by H. Seifert [193] in 1948 which requires 
that NE is homeomorphic to an n-cell. In 1917 G. Birkhoff proved the statement 
for NE = 8 2 . 
Using the geometric approach, Bolotin's result has been rediscovered by H. 
Gluck and W. Ziller (1983) [106] and later on by V. Benci (1984) [18]. We should 
mention that in the case ONE i= 0 the periodic solution found by the theorem is a 
so-called brake orbit. This is one for which the motion 7f(~(t)) in the configuration 
space N E moves back and forth between different points of the boundary ONE 
but otherwise runs through the interior. Note that the systems considered are 
reversible: if ~(t) is a solution of X H then -~( -t) is also a solution so that with 
a motion x(t) = 7f(~(t)) in the configuration space the motion x(-t) = 7f(-~(-t)) 
traversed backwards also corresponds to a solution of X H. This situation is, of 
course, familiar from the 2-dimensional case of a function H (x, y) = ~y2 + V (x), 
as depicted in the following figure 4.9. 
There are many results for closed geodesics which, applied to the Jacobi metric 
lead to closed characteristics of energy surfaces. We refer to Klingenberg's book

[127] and V. Bangert's survey article [14] for these developments. We should point 
out that only very recently V. Bangert [15] and J. Franks [100] succeeded in es-
tablishing infinitely many closed geodesics on every Riemannian two-sphere! 
The geometric approach outlined above is applicable only for a very restricted 
class of hypersurfaces contained in a cotangent bundle and we would like to men-
tion, that by a quite different analytical approach, C. Viterbo and H. Hofer 1988 
in [121] confirmed the Weinstein conjecture for cotangent bundles as follows: 
Theorem 7. (Hofer-Viterho) Let N be a compact manifold with dimN ~ 2, and 
M = T* N the canonical symplectic manifold. Assume S is a smooth, compact and 
connected hypersurface in M having the property that the bounded component of 
M\S contains the zero section of T* N. Then P(S) -:f. 0, if S is of contact type. 
It is, so far, not known whether the proviso about the zero section is really 
necessary to guarantee a closed characteristic on S. 
We next turn to (I~2n, wo) which can be viewed as the trivial cotangent bundle 
T*(]Rn). The Liouville form>. is now globally defined by 
n 
>. = L yjdxj 
j=l 
and Wo = d>.. W~ know that the capacity Co is finite on bounded sets on ]R2n. This 
fact will be used in order to prove some very special existence results based on the 
following observation:

Lemma. Assume the smooth Hamiltonian H : JR2n ~ JR satisfies 
),(XH ) > 0 
for all (x, y) E JR2n 
with 
y -I- o. 
Then every compact and regular energy surface S = {H (x, y) = E} is of contact 
type. 
Since ),(XH) = (fjy H(x,y),y), and since S is contained in a neighborhood 
having finite capacity Co, we immediately conclude in view of the lemma and 
Theorem 5: 
Theorem 8. If H E Coo (JR2n, JR) satisfies 
a 
(ayH(x,y),y»o forall (x,y)EJR2n 
with y-l-O, 
then every compact and regular energy surface S of H possesses a periodic solution 
for X H . 
The assumption is satisfied e.g. for H(x, y) 
A(x) > 0, i.e., positive definite. 
~(A(x)y,y) + V(x), with 
Proof of the Lemma. If S does not contain points (x, 0) with x E JRn, it is of contact 
type as explained above, the contact structure being given by the Liouville form. 
Otherwise we simply modify the Liouville form and define a I-form 0: on JR2n 
setting 
0: = ), - c:dF, 
where the function F E Coo (JR2n ,JR) is given by 
a 
F(x, y) = (ax H(x, 0), y). 
Clearly, do: = d)' = Wo, and we shall show for c: > 0 sufficiently small that o:(XH) > 
o on S, so that the one-form 0: meets all the requirements in the definition of 
contact type. By assumption ),(XH) = (%y H(x,y),y) > 0 if y -I- 0, so that for 
fixed x the function y f--t (%yH(x, y), y) has a minimum at y = 0 and it follows 
that %yH(x,O) = o. A computation shows that

By assumption, dH -I- 0 on S, hence !1xH(x,O) -I- O. Consequently, if (x, y) E S 
and y is small, the expression in the bracket of the formula above is positive. On 
the other hand, if (x, y) E Sand y is bounded away from y = 0, then the first 
term is bounded away from zero and, S being compact, we can choose c: > 0 so 
small that it dominates the second term. Now o:(XH) > 0 on S, as we wanted to 
prove .• 
By the same argument we have also proved the following, more general, state-
ment discovered in 1987 by V. Benci, H. Hofer and P. Rabinowitz [19]. 

134 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
Theorem 9. Assume the energy surface S = {(x, y) I H(x, y) = E} is compact and 
regular and has the following property: if (x, y) E Sand y i=- 0 then A(XH) > 0, 
and if (x, 0) E S then !1xH(x,O) i=- o. Then S is of contact type and hence XH has 
a periodic solution of energy E. 
The compactness of the energy surfaces is a crucial assumption for the results 
above. The existence of periodic solutions on non compact energy surfaces requires 
additional conditions as the example H(x, y) = !lyl2 in ]R2n which has no periodic 
solutions shows. We would like to mention a result in the non compact case due to 
D. Offin, in [171] (1985). It states that if the boundary aN E in the configuration 
space is disconnected while N E itself is connected then (under some additional 
technical assumptions) there exists a periodic orbit of energy E. This orbit is a 
brake orbit oscillating between two points belonging to different components of 
aN E. Offin obtains the periodic orbit by a direct variational argument minimizing 
the energy integral of the corresponding Jacobi metric in the configuration space. 
Of special interest in mechanics is the cotangent bundle T* (Tn) of the torus 
Tn = ]Rn /zn which is isomorphic to Tn X ]Rn. This symplectic manifold occurs 
as the phase space in many mechanical systems; in particular, for systems which 
are close to integrable ones. We shall briefly explain how it arises, referring to 
Appendix 1 for details. We start from a particularly simple system, a so-called 
integrable system. It is characterized by the property of having sufficiently many 
integrals such that the task of solving (or integrating) the differential equations 
becomes essentially trivial. More precisely, we consider a Hamiltonian system XHo 
on a symplectic manifold (M, w) of dimension 2n. It is called integrable (in the 
sense of Liouville) if there exist n = ~ dim M functions Fj : M --4 ]R, 1 :::; j :::; n, 
having the following properties: 
(i) 
dF1 , dF2 , ••• , dFn 
are linearly independent on M, 
(ii) 
{Fi,Fj } = 0 
for all 
Z,J, 
(iii) 
{Ha,Fj } = 0 forall j, 
where the functions {Fi' Fj } = w(XFj , X Fj ) are the Poisson brackets. Assume now 
that there exists a level set 
Nc* = {x E M I Fj (x) = c;, 1:::; j :::; n} 
which is compact and connected. Then one concludes from (i) and (ii) that N c* ~ 
Tn is an embedded n-dimensional torus, which is Lagrangian. Moreover, there 
exists an open neighborhood U of N c* foliated into such tori in which one can 
introduce so-called action and angle variables. This means that there exists a 
symplectic diffeomorphism 
'ljJ : Tn X D ----+ U 

4.4 "CLASSICAL" HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS 
135 
Here Xj (mod 1) are the angle variables of Tn and y E D are the action variables, 
where D C lRn is an open set. Moreover, the functions Fj 0 'Ij;(x, y) =: fJ(y) 
depend only on the action variables. It then follows from assumption (iii) that the 
Hamiltonian system looks very simple on U, namely 
Hoo'lj;(x,y) = ho(y), 
i.e., it depends only on the action variables. What we have described is the Arnold-
Jost theorem on the existence of action-angle variables. It extends a local statement 
which goes back to Liouville, and we refer to the Appendix for a proof. The 
Hamiltonian equation on Tn X D, 
x 
ty ho(y) 
y 
0, 
can be solved explicitly and for all times. Indeed we read off for the flow on Tn X D 
cpt(x,y) = (x+tw,y) 
where 
B 
w = w(y) = By ho(y). 
Geometrically each torus Tn X {y} is invariant, the motion on it is linear and 
given by the frequencies w(y) E lRn. For example, if w is a rationally independent 
vector, the orbits are dense on the torus and describe quasi-periodic motions of the 
system. Orbits with w(y) = j . ao for j E 7J.,n are evidently periodic. These periodic 
solutions have Floquet multipliers all equal to 1 and one expects, therefore, that 
the integrability is destroyed immediately under the slightest perturbation of the 
system. Indeed integrable systems are very rare, hence of particular interest; we 
refer to J. Moser [166] for this topic. 
There are, however, many important systems in physics which are close to 
integrable systems in the sense that 
is small, where H(x, y) is a function on Tn X D. In general, the integrability 
is lost under perturbation and the orbit structure of X H is extremely intricate. 
Nevertheless, the celebrated K.A.M.-theory states that many of the quasi-periodic 
solutions of Xho can be continued to quasi-periodic solutions of XH provided only 
that E is sufficiently small, the number k of derivatives is sufficiently large and the 
integrable system is nondegenerate in the sense that 
( 4.13) 

136 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
This condition requires the system ho to be nonlinear, so that the frequencies 
depend on the amplitudes. In sharp contrast to these analytically very difficult 
perturbation results for the existence of special solutions, we shall establish global 
periodic solutions for every system H(x, y) on Tn X ]Rn assuming, however, that 
the energy surfaces are compact. This will follow from the following result for the 
capacities on T*(Tn) due to Mei-Yue Jiang [125]. 
Proposition 4. Let M = Tn X ]Rn with Tn = lRn /27rZn, equipped with the canonical 
symplectic structure w = d(E;=l yjdiJj ). Then every capacity function c is finite 
on open and bounded subsets of M. Moreover, for every a > 0, 
c(Tn X (-a, a)n) = 47ra = c(Tn x (-a, a) x ]Rn-1). 
Proof. The proof follows readily from the axioms of a capacity. We start with the 
symplectic diffeomorphism cp in 2 dimensions: 
cp : 8 1 x (-a, a) ---+ A = {(x,y) E ]R21a < x2 +y2 < 5a} 
given by y = v3a + 2r cos iJ, x = v3a + 2r sin iJ, where 0 ~ iJ ~ 27r and -a < r < 
+a. Then cp*(dy 1\ dx) = dr 1\ diJ. Taking a tensor product we find a symplectic 
diffeomorphism Tn X (-a, a)n -+ A x A x ... x A C ]R2n, where the product of the 
annuli corresponds to the symplectic splitting ]R2n = ]R2 EEl ... EEl ]R2. Therefore it 
remains to show that c(A x A x ... x A) = 47ra which is the area of the annulus 
A. For c > 0 there exist symplectic embeddings 
D(2va - c) ---+ A ---+ D(2va + c), 
where D(R) is the two-disk of radius R. They give rise to symplectic embeddings 
for the product and we conclude that 
Since this holds true for every c > 0 the first equation in the theorem follows; the 
second one is proved the same way .• 
In particular, the special capacity Co is finite on bounded open sets of T*(Tn) 
and we can apply all the qualitative existence results obtained so far. We conclude, 
for example, that a compact hypersurface 8 c T* (Tn) which is of contact type 
always carries a closed characteristic. One can verify, as in the lemma above, 
that every compact and regular energy surface of a classical system of the form 
H = ~lyl2 + Vex) on (x,y) E Tn X ]Rn, where V is periodic in all its variables, is 
of contact type and hence possesses a periodic solution of X H . Nothing is known, 
however, about the nature of this solution. To which homotopy class of loops on 
T* (Tn) does it belong? Is it the brake orbit already guaranteed by Theorem 6? 
Special periodic solutions for such classical systems can be found by means of the 
Maupertuis-Jacobi principle, as is shown in the survey article [129] by V.V. Koslov 
(1985). 

4.5 THE TORUS AND HERMAN'S NON-CLOSING LEMMA 
137 
4.5 
The torus and Herman's Non-Closing Lemma 
If 'ljJ : S x ( -1, + 1) ....... U c M is a parameterized family of hypersurfaces modelled 
on S in a symplectic manifold (M,w) then U is the union of hypersurfaces SE = 
'ljJ(S X {c}), and we know that 
co(U,w) < 00 
=:} 
there is an c with P(SE) #- 0. 
Conversely, of course, if P(SE) = 0 for every c then co(U,w) = 00 and, by the 
monotonicity property of the capacity co(M,w) = +00. We shall next describe an 
example due to E. Zehnder[231] which illustrates this situation. We consider the 
manifold 
M = T3 X [0,1], 
where 
T3 =]R3 /71.,3 
is the 3-dimensional torus and define a distinguished symplectic structure on M by 
slightly modifying the standard structure Wo on ]R4. Recall that to every constant 
matrix A satisfying det A#-O and AT = -A, we can associate the symplectic 
structure w by 
w(X, Y) = (AX, Y) 
on ]R4, and then, of course, also on M. A Hamiltonian function H : M ....... ]R is 
simply a function H 
: ]R3 x [0,1] ....... ]R such that H(X1,X2,X3,X4) is periodic in 
Xl, X2, X3 of period 1. The Hamiltonian vector field X H is, as usual, defined by 
W(XH' Y) = -dH(Y) 
for all Y E ]R4, and one obtains 
We now define A by setting -A -1 = J*, and

with two real numbers 01,02 E R Then det J* = 1 and the symplectic form

Choosing the Hamiltonian function Ho : M ....... ]R defined as 
(4.16) 

138 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
the Hamiltonian vector field on M, given by 
is constant. The energy surfaces 
(4.17) 
H01(C) = {x E M I Ho(x) = 
X4 = c} 
are regular and, since Xj E Sl for 1 :=:; j :=:; 3, equal to the 3-dimensional tori 
H01(C) = T3 X {c}. We introduce the abbreviation 
(4.18) 
The flow of the Hamiltonian equations restricted to the energy surfaces T3 x {c} 
is linear and determined by 
( 4.19) 
If we choose a rationally independent, requiring 
(a,j)I:-O for 0l:-jE'Z}, 
then all the orbits of (4.19) are dense on T3, in view of Kronecker's theorem. 
Consequently, we have an example of a Hamiltonian system whose energy surfaces 
are all regular and compact, which, however, does not admit any periodic solution. 
Incidentally, the energy surfaces are not of contact type. 
As an aside, we remark that one can easily construct an embedding r.p : T3 x 
[O,IJ --+ ]R4. The induced parameterized family of hypersurfaces modelled on T3 
carries no closed characteristic with respect to the pushed forward symplectic 
structure which we denote again by w*. However, w* on r.p(M) C ]R4 is not equiv-
alent to the standard structure (r.p( M), wo) induced from ]R4. Indeed, wo is an 
exact symplectic structure, while w* is not; moreover, co(r.p(M),w*) = +00 while 
co(r.p(M),wo) < 00. In particular, this example fails to represent a counterexample 
to the conjecture that every hypersurface S C (]R2n, wo) has a closed characteristic. 
We note that our vector field X on T3 defined by (4.19) satisfies (3(X) I:- 0 for the 
closed I-form {3 = dX1 on T3. Assume now, more generally, that S is any compact 
manifold without boundary of dim S = 2n - 1 and that X is a vector field on S 
satisfying (3(X) I:- 0 for a closed I-form {3 on S. Then S cannot be embedded as a 
hypersurface S C (M,w) in any symplectic manifold having an exact symplectic 
structure, i.e., w = d>", such that X E £8, i.e., belongs to the characteristic line 
bundle. Indeed, suppose it could be, then we could conclude {3/\ (d>..)n-1 to be a 
volume form on S, since (3(X) I:- 0 and X E kerd>"IS, so that 
vol (S) = J 
{3/\ (d>..t-1 I:- 0 . 
8 

4.5 THE TORUS AND HERMAN'S NON-CLOSING LEMMA 
139 
This, however, is not possible, since the form (31\ (d,\)n-I is equal to d('\ 1\ (3 1\ 
(d,\)n-2) and hence is an exact form on S. 
We now restrict the symplectic structure w* even further by requiring that 
a be not only rationally independent but satisfies, in addition, the diophantine 
conditions 
(D.C.) 
for all 0 i=- j E Z3 with two constants "( > 0 and T > 2. Almost every vector 
a E ]R3 satisfies such conditions. It then turns out that the above example is 
actually dynamically stable under perturbations of Ho small with sufficiently many 
derivatives. This surprising phenomenon was recently discovered by M. Herman 
[110, 111], see also J.C. Yoccoz [229]. In our setting he proved 
Theorem 10. (M. Herman's non-closing lemma) Consider the symplectic manifold 
(M,w*) = (T3 x [0, l],w*) with the symplectic structure (4.15) and a E]R3 satis-
fying the conditions (D.C.) Let Ho(x) = X4. Then there exists a neighborhood W 
of Ho 
for some small 8 > 0 and k > T + 2, such that for every HEW and every c in 
~ :s; c :s; ~, the regular energy surface 
has no periodic solution for X H . 
We note that this dynamical rigidity phenomenon is a property of the special 
symplectic structure w*. Postponing the proof we first point out an important 
consequence of Herman's theorem. 
In view of Poincare's recurrence theorem (see Chapter 1) almost every point x 
on a compact energy surface for a Hamiltonian system H, is a recurrent point and 
one may ask whether there exists a nearby system having a periodic trajectory 
passing near x. This is the so-called Closing Problem. The answer depends on the 
notion of what is "nearby". In their work [179] (1983) C.C. Pugh and C. Robinson 
showed for the Hamiltonian case, that there is a sequence of Hamiltonian systems, 
H j and a sequence of corresponding periodic points, Xj for these approximate 
systems satisfying 
H j ---7 H 
m 
C2 
and 
Xj ---7 x. 
This is a special case of the celebrated CI-Closing Lemma in [184]. It is a long 
standing open question whether Hj can be chosen so that Hj 
---7 H in C k for 
k > 2. The surprising answer of M. Herman to this question is that on the special 
manifold (M, w*) the Ck-Closing Lemma is false, if k is sufficiently large, namely, 
roughly larger than the dimension of the manifold in question. 

140 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
Proof of Theorem 10. Consider the neighborhood of Ho given by 
H = X4 + h(x) and Ihlck 
small 
on M. The Hamiltonian vector field X H is represented as 
HX2 + olHx4 
-HXl + o2Hx4 
(4.20) 
XH(X) 
J* '\lH(x) 
HX4 
- HX 3 
-
olHx1 
- o2Hx2 
The energy surface for c, defined by 
X4 + h(x) = H(x) = c, 
is an embedded torus T3. Indeed we can solve for X4, and find X4 = K (Xl, X2, X3, c), 
where the function K satisfies the identity 
(4.21) 
for all X E T3. The functions are periodic in x E T3. To compute the vector field 
XH on H-l(C) we differentiate the identity (4.21) and find HXj = -HX4 . KXj 
on H-l(C) for 1 ::; j ::; 3. Therefore, in view of (4.20) the vector field XH is, on 
H-l(c) given, by 
(4.22) 
where p(x) = HX4 (x,K) is a positive function. The vector field (4.22) has, up to 
reparameterization, the same orbits as 
(4.23) 
Note that this vector field V on T3 is a perturbation of the constant vector field 
x = 0 on T 3 , and we can apply a special case of the K.A.M.-theory. We make use 
of the following result due to J. Moser 1966 in [161]. 

4.5 THE TORUS AND HERMAN'S NON-CLOSING LEMMA 
141 
Theorem 11. On the torus Tn = ~n jzn consider a vector field of the form 
x = 0; + f(x), 
and assume the constant vector 0; E ~n to satisfy the diophantine conditions 
for all 0 =I=- j E zn with two constants I > 0 and T > n - 1. Then, if lflem is 
sufficiently small and m > T + 1, there exist a constant vector A E ~n and a 
C 1-diffeomorphism u = id + v : Tn --+ Tn near the identity, such that 
(du) -1 (0; + f + A) 0 u = 0;. 
In other words, if a vector field is near the constant vector field 0; together with 
sufficiently many derivatives, it can be modified by constants A E ~n, so that this 
modified vector field is equivalent to 0;. The proof of this seminal small denominator 
result is based on an analytically subtle iteration technique in infinitely many 
spaces and will not be carried out here; we refer to [161]. 
In general A =I=- 0, as already the example f = const shows. But in our case the 
vector field f has an additional structure inherited from the Hamiltonian nature of 
the problem and this additional structure allows us to conclude that A = O. This 
will follow from the 
Lemma. Let V be a vector field on the torus Tn satisfying div V = O. Assume 
(du) -1 . V 0 U = 0;, 
with an irrational vector 0; E ~n, and a diffeomorphism u = id + v of the torus. 
Then u preserves the Lebesgue measure on Tn and 
J 
V = 0;. 
Postponing the proof of the lemma we first prove Herman's result. Abbreviating 
the vector field on the right hand side of (4.23) by 0;+ f(x), we first conclude from 
Theorem 11 that there exists a A E ~3 such that the vector field 
V:= o;+f(X)+A 
is transformed into the constant vector field x = 0; on T3. The vector field f has a 
special form inherited from the Hamiltonian structure. Namely J f = 0, since the 
integrations of derivatives of periodic functions vanish. Consequently, 
J 
V = 0;+ A. 
T3 

142 
CHAPTER 4 EXISTENCE OF CLOSED CHARACTERISTICS 
In addition, V satisfies div V = o. Therefore, we conclude by the lemma that 
0: + >. = 0: and thus>. = O. We have proved that the flow of the vector field (4.23) 
on T3 is conjugated to the linear flow of x = 0: and hence has no periodic solutions. 
This holds true for every constant C in ! ~ C ~ ~. The proof of Theorem 10 is 
finished, and it remains to prove the lemma. 
Integrating V 0 u = du( 0:) and observing that u = id + v we find 
J Vo udll = 0: 
Tn 
since the integral over dv(o:) vanishes. In order to prove the lemma we only have 
to show that u* Il = Il i.e., preserves the Lebesgue measure. The flow 'II} of the 
vector field V satisfies 
This is a consequence of the assumption div V = O. Moreover 
u-1 0 'ljJt 0 U = Rto., 
t E lR 
with the translations Rto. : x I-t x + to: on the torus. Therefore 'ljJt 0 u = u 0 Rto. 
and in view of ('ljJt) * Il = Il we find 
By assumption, 0: is irrational so that all the orbits t I-t Rto.(x) are dense on 
Tn. Since Il is a constant form we conclude that u" Il = a . Il with a constant a. 
Integrating over the torus 
we find a = 1, proving that indeed u" Il = Il. This finishes the proof of the lemma .• 
Evidently, also the symplectic manifold (T4, w*) has infinite capacity Co 
eo(T\w*) = +00 
if w* is the particular symplectic structure defined by (4.15) with 0: = (0:1,0:2,1) 
chosen to be irrational. We know that in the 2-dimensional case Co (T2 , w) < 00 for 
every volume form w. It is an open problem whether 
if n > 1. Here Wo is the standard symplectic structure induced from lR2n. 

Chapter 5 
Geometry of compactly supported 
symplectic mappings in ]R2n 
In this chapter we shall study the group V of those symplectic diffeomorphisms 
of ]R2n which are generated by time-dependent Hamiltonian vector fields having 
compactly supported Hamiltonians. We shall construct, in particular, an astonish-
ing bi-invariant metric d on V, following H. Hofer [116]. Defining the energy E(1/J) 
of an element 1/J E V by means of the oscillations of generating Hamiltonians, the 
metric d will be defined by d(<p, 1/J) = E(<p-l1/J). It is of CO-nature. The verification 
of the property that d(<p,1/J) = 0 if and only if <p = 1/J, is not easy. It is based on 
the action principle. The metric d is intimately related, on the one hand, to the 
capacity function Co introduced in Chapter 3 and hence to periodic orbits and, on 
the other hand, to a special capacity e defined on subsets of ]R2n and satisfying 
e(U) 2: co(U). The capacity e is called the displacement energy: e(U) measures 
the distance between the identity map and the set of 1/J E V which displaces U 
from itself, in the sense that 1/J(U) n U = 0. A crucial role in our considerations 
will be played by the action spectrum, a(1/J) , of the fixed points of an element 
1/J E V. It turns out to be a compact nowhere dense subset of R In contrast to the 
simple variational technique used for a fixed Hamiltonian in Chapter 3, a minimax 
principle will be designed which is applicable simultaneously to all Hamiltonians 
generating the elements of V. It singles out a distinguished action ')'( <p) E a( <p). 
The map "y : (V, d) --+ ]R is a continuous section of the action spectrum bundle 
over Vj it is the main technical tool in this section. Its properties will also be used 
in order to establish infintely many periodic orbits for certain elements of V, and 
to describe the geodesics of (V, d). We mention that the completion of the group 
V with respect to the metric d is not understood. 
5.1 
A special metric d for a group V of 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
We consider the symplectic space (]R2n, w) with the standard symplectic structure 
W = Wo and denote by 1t the vector space of all smooth and compactly supported 
Hamiltonian functions H = H(t, x) : [0,1] X ]R2n --+ R Associated to every HE 1t 
is a time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field XH on ]R2n defined by 
143 

144 
CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
Since the vector field XH has compact support the Hamiltonian equations 
x = XH(t,x), 
x(O) = Xo E ]R.2n 
can be solved over the whole time interval [0,1] for every given initial value Xo E 
]R.2n. We thus obtain a I-parameter family of symplectic mappings cpk for t E [0,1]. 
It is defined by 
cpk(xo) = x(t), 
where x(t) solves the equation for the initial value Xo. Clearly cpk(x) = x if Ixl is 
sufficiently large. By 
1 
CPH = CPH 
we shall denote the time-l map ofthe flow cpk and define the group Vof compactly 
supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms by 
v = { CPH I HE 1i}. 
Recall that the support of a map cP is defined as the closed set supp( cp) = clos 
{x I cp(x) =I- x}. Every compactly supported symplectic diffeomorphism can be 
interpolated this way by the flow of a time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field; 
however, it is not known whether the Hamiltonian function can be chosen to be in 
1i if n > 2. It follows from results of M. Gromov [107] that in the special case of]R.4 
the group V is contractible. In particular, every compactly supported symplectic 
diffeomorphism cP in ]R.4 can be written as cP = cP H with H E 1i and, therefore, 
belongs to V. 
It is the aim of this chapter to study some geometric properties of this group 
V of Hamiltonian mappings on ]R2n. We begin with two preliminary formal state-
ments which will be useful later on. 
Definition. Given H,K E 1i and iJ E V we define the functions H,H#K and Hi} 
in 1i as follows: 
H(t,x)

Proof. The third formula is the transformation law of Hamiltonian vector fields 
under symplectic transformations, as we know from the introduction. The first 
formula follows from the second one while the last one is a consequence of the first 
two. To prove the second formula, we abbreviate the notation and observe that 
We have to show that 'Pt 0 'ljJt is the flow of XH#K' Differentiating, we find 
By the transformation law of Hamiltonian vector fields the second term is equal 
to 
and the claim is proved .• 
By definition, a smooth arc in V is a map t f-+ 'ljJt from I = [0,1] into V such 
that (t,x) f-+ 'ljJt(x) is a smooth mapping from I X JR2n into JR2n and such that 
there exists a compact set in JR2n containing all the supports of 'ljJt for tEl. We 
shall denote by A the set of smooth arcs [0,1] ---+ V : t f-+ 'Pt satisfying 'Po = id. 
Proposition 2. The map H f-+ 'ljJk from 11. into A is a bijection onto A. 
Proof. If H and K satisfy 'Pit- = 'Pk for tEl we find by differentiation that 
XH = XK. Therefore, dHt = dKt so that H(t, x) = K(t,x) since the functions 
have compact support. This proves the injectivity of the map; in order to prove 
the surjectivity we consider a smooth arc t f-+ 'ljJt in V satisfying 'ljJ0 = id, and 
define the time-dependent vector field 
so that 
d 
. 
dt 'ljJt = Xt('ljJt) and 'ljJ0 = td. 
Because of ('ljJt)*w = w, we have Lxtw = O. In view of dw = 0 we find d(ixtw) = O. 
The I-form ixtw being closed is exact on JR2n, by the Poincare lemma. There is a 
function H : I X JR2n ---+ JR, determined by 
H(t,x) = -1
1 w(Xt(sx),x)ds, 

146 
CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
which satisfies -dHt = ixtw. Since Xt has compact support, dHt(x) = 0, for 
tEl and Ixl 2: R, for some large R and there is a K E 1i with dHt = dKt.It is 
given by H(t,x) - H(t,x*) for some x* with Ix*1 2: R. Consequently Xt = X Kt as 
claimed .• 
We next define the length of an arc t 1-+ 1jJt belonging to A. In view of Propo-
sition 2 there is a unique H E 1i generating this arc by 
1jJt = cpk. 
Define for H E C.;xo (~2n,~) the norm (called the oscillation)

Then 
IIH 0 cpll = IIHII 
for every diffeomorphism cp of ~2n. If now H E 1i, we can associate with the 
Hamiltonian vector field X Ht the norm IIXHtl1 := IIHtl1 and find 
Introducing the norm in 1i by

which agrees for autonomous H with definition (5.1), we are led to define the 
length of the arc 1jJt = cpk connecting 1jJl with id, as

Definition. The energy of a symplectic map 1jJ in V is the number E(1jJ) 2: 0 defined 
by 
Evidently 
(5.4) 
E(1jJ) = inf{I(1jJ[O,ll) I the arc 1jJt in A satisfies 1jJl = 1jJ}. 
The Hamiltonian H = 0 in 1i generates the identity map 1jJ = id and consequently 
E(id) = O. Conversely, 
(5.5) 
E(1jJ) >0, if1jJ-=/=id. 
But this crucial fact is not at all obvious. It follows from the following estimates 
for the energy function in which eo(U) = co(U, w) denotes the special capacity 
introduced in Chapter 3. For notational convenience we set co(0) = 0, and recall 
that Z(R) denotes the symplectic cylinder of radius R. 

5.1 A SPECIAL METRIC d FOR A GROUP V ...

Theorem 1. (energy-capacity inequality) For every 1/J E V 
sup{eo(U) I U open and 1/J(U) n U = 0} ~ E(1/J) 
E(1/J) ~ 16inf{7rR2 I there is a cp E V with supp (cp1/Jcp-l) C Z(R)}. 
We see, in particular, that the energy E(1/J) is always larger than the capacity 
co(U) of every open set U which can be displaced from itself by the map 1/J. It is 
now easy to deduce the claim (5.5): indeed taking a point x* satisfying 1/J(x*) =I x* 
there exists an open ball B(x*, c) = U of radius c > 0, which is displaced from 
itself, 1/J(U) n U = 0. Using co(U) = 7rc2 we thus conclude from Theorem 1 that 
E( 1/J) :2: 7rc2 > 0 proving the claim (5.5). 
The proof of the first estimate in Theorem 1 will be based on the existence of 
a distinguished critical point of the action functional, it will be carried out in the 
Sections 5.5 and 5.6 below. 
Theorem 2. (Co -energy estimate) For every 1/J E V 
E(1/J) ~ C diameter supp (1/J) lid -1/Jlco 
with a constant C ~ 128. 
This statement expresses the continuity of E at the identity map in the Co_ 
topology. The proof of Theorem 2 will also be postponed to Section 5.6 below. 
Proposition 3. The energy function E : V ----t lR meets the following properties: 
(i) 
E(cp) :2: 0, and E(cp) = 0 {:::::::} cp = id 
(ii) 
E(cp) = E(cp-l) 
(iii) 
E(iJcpiJ- 1 ) = E(cp) 
(iv) 
E(cp1/J) ~ E(cp) + E(1/J) , 
where cp,1/J E V and where iJ is a symplectic diffeomorphism of lR2n. 
Proof. The proofs of (i) and (ii) follow readily from the definition of E using the 
nontrivial fact (5.5) proved later on. Clearly 
l( cp~,l]) = l( cpijl]) 
implying E(cp) = E(cp-l). From 
we find

which implies E( ep H 0 ep K) ::; E( ep H) + E( ep K) and the last claim (iv) follows .• 
We can derive an estimate for the commutators in V, denoted by 
(5.6) 
and first claim that 
(5.7) 
E([ep, 'l/J]) ::; 2 min{E(ep), E('l/J)} 
for ep, 'l/J E V. Indeed, in view of the statements (ii)-(iv) in Proposition 3 we can 
estimate E(ep'l/Jep-l'l/J-l) ::; E(ep'l/Jep-l) + E('l/J-l) ::; 2E('l/J) and E(ep'l/Jep-l'l/J-l) ::; 
E(ep) +E('l/Jep-l'l/J-l) = 2E(ep), hence proving the claim. We now deduce an "a pri-
ori" estimate for the energy of commutators of those maps having their supports 
in a fixed open set. 
Proposition 4. If U C ]R2n is open and bounded and if fJ E V satisfies fJ(U) n U = 0, 
then 
E([ep, '1/>]) ::; 4E( {)) 
for all ep, 'l/J E V with supp( ep) and supp( 'l/J) contained in U. 
Proof. Define 
"( := ep fJ- 1 ep-l fJ E V 
then "(IU = eplU since fJ(U) nU = 0 and supp(ep) c U. Consequently ep'l/Jep-l'l/J-l = 
"('l/J,,(-I'l/J-l on U, and since both maps are the identity maps outside of U, they 
are equal on ]R2n. Therefore, in view of (5.7) and Proposition 3 
E([ep,'l/J]) = E(b,'l/J]) ::; 2E("() ::; 2E(fJ-1 ) + 2E(fJ) = 4E(fJ) 
as we wanted to show .• 
Proposition 3 allows us to define a distinguished metric d : V x V -+ [0,00], by 
means of the energy: 
(5.8) 
deep, 'l/J) := E(ep-l'l/J). 
In particular, the energy of 'l/J E V, E( 'l/J) = d( id, 'l/J), is the distance from the 
identity map and we remark that, in view of the last formula in Proposition 1, 
(5.9) 
deep, 'l/J) = inf {IIH - KII I H generates 'l/J and K generates ep}. 

5.1 A SPECIAL METRIC d FOR A GROUP V ... 
149 
Theorem 3. The function d is a bi-invariant metric on V, i.e., it satisfies for all 
i.p, 'Ij; and {) belonging to V: 
(i) 
d(i.p,'Ij;) :2: 0 and d(i.p,'Ij;) = 0 ¢} i.p = 'Ij; 
(ii) 
(iii) 
d(i.p, 'Ij;) :::; d(i.p, {)) + d({), 'Ij;) and d(i.p, 'Ij;) 
d({)i.p, {)'Ij;) = d(i.p, 'Ij;) = d(i.p{) , 'Ij;{)). 
d('Ij;, i.p) 
Theorem 3 is an immediate consequence of Proposition 3. In the following we 
can consider (V, d) as a topological group. Note that our intrinsic metric on V is 
continuous in the CO-metric provided the supports are uniformly bounded. Indeed, 
in view of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, 
sup{ co(U)! U open and 'Ij;(U) n i.p(U) = 0} :::; d( i.p, 'Ij;) 
(5.10) 
d(i.p,'Ij;):::; 128· 
diameter (suppi.p-l'lj;) ·sup!i.p(x) -'Ij;(x)! 
x 
for every pair i.p and 'Ij; belonging to V. The group V admits, in addition, an order 
structure. Define the positive subset V+ c V by 
V+ = { 'Ij; H ! H E 1t and H :2: O} 
and the negative subset V- c V by 
V- = { 'lj;H ! H E 1t and H :::; O}. 
If i.p E V+ then i.p-l E V- and {)rp{)-l E V+ for every symplectic diffeomorphism 
{) of ]R2n. This follows from Proposition 1. We shall prove later on in Section 5.4 
that 
(5.11) 
V+ n V- = {id}. 
A partial order structure :2: on V can, therefore, as we shall prove, be defined as 
follows: 
(5.12) 
Proposition 5. Assume i.p, 'Ij; and {) E V. 
(i) 
If i.p :2: 'Ij; and 'Ij; :2: i.p then i.p = 'Ij; 
(ii) 
If i.p :2: 'Ij; and 'Ij; :2: {) then i.p :2: {). 
In addition, if i.p :2: 'Ij;, then i.p{) :2: 'Ij;{).

CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
Proof. If <p 0 'IjJ-l E V+ and 'IjJ 0 <p-l E V+, then <p 0 'IjJ-l E V+ n V- and hence by 
(5.11), we conclude that <p = 'IjJ proving (i). Next observe that if <p and 'IjJ are in 
V+ then also <p 0 'IjJ E V+ in view of Proposition 1 implying (ii) .• 
We conclude this section with two observations due to Y. Eliashberg and L. 
Polterovich [76]. They consider an arbitrary bi-invariant pseudo-metric p: VxV--+ 
[0,00). By definition this p satisfies the properties (i)-(iii) of Theorem 3, except 
that it is not required that p(<p,'IjJ) =I- 0 if <p =I- 'IjJ. Recalling that E('IjJ) = d(id,'IjJ) 
and arguing as in the proof of Proposition 4, one finds that 
(5.13) 
p( id, [<p, 'IjJ]) ::; 4p( id, 19) 
for all <p, 'IjJ and 19 E V satisfying 19(U) n U = 0 and supp(<p), supp('IjJ) c U, for 
some open set U C ]R2n. Following H. Hofer [116] one can associate with p the 
so-called displacement energy ep(U) of an open and bounded subset U C ]R2n by 
defining 
(5.14) 
ep(U) := inf{ p(id, 19) 119 E V satisfies 19(U) n U = 0}. 
It then follows from (5.13) that 
4ep(U) ~ p(id, [<p, 'IjJ]) 
for every pair <p and 'IjJ E V having their supports contained in U. If p is not 
only a pseudometric but a metric, then p(id, [<p,'IjJ]) > 0 provided <p and 'IjJ do not 
commute. Consequently ep(U) > 0 and we have proved 
Proposition 6. If p is a bi-invariant metric on V then the displacement energy ep 
is positive on open sets. 
This applies in particular to our distinguished hi-invariant metric p = d. Note, 
however, that the metric character of this d is concluded from the nontrivial esti-
mate in Theorem 1 from which it follows that ed(U) ~ eo(U) > 0 for every open 
set U. The special displacement energy ed will be studied in more detail later on. 
In order to construct the intrinsic bi-invariant metric d on V we started off 
from the sup-norm IIHII on C~(]R2n). We can, of course, start off as well from the 
V-norm 
IIHllp := (/ IH(x)IP dx)t 
which is evidently invariant under V, i.e., IIH 0 <pllp = IIHllp if <p E V. We thus 
arrive at dp(<p,'IjJ) = Ep(<p'IjJ-l) which defines a bi-invariant pseudometric on V. It 
turns out, however, that this dp for 1 ::; p < 00 is not a metric. This has recently 
been proved by Y. Eliashberg and L. Polterovich [76]. They showed, more precisely, 
that 
Ep('IjJ) =0, ifp=l, 
for every 'IjJ E V having vanishing Calabi invariant, i.e., 
rl r H(t,x)dxdt=O 
10 1R,2n 
if'IjJ = 'ljJH for H E 1t. Moreover, Ep('IjJ) = 0 for all 'IjJ E V provided 1 < p < 00. 

5.2 THE ACTION SPECTRUM OF A HAMILTONIAN MAP 
151 
5.2 The action spectrum of a Hamiltonian map 
For H E 1i we shall denote the set of fixed points of the associated Hamiltonian 
map 'PH by 
Fix('PH) = {x E R2n I 'PH(X) = x}. 
If Xo E Fix ('PH ) then the solution x(t) = 'Pk(xo) for ° 
~ t ~ 1 of the Hamiltonian 
equation ± = XH(X) satisfies x(l) = x(o) and hence is a loop in R2n. Its action is 
the real number A(xo, H) defined by 
A(xo,H) = 11 ~(-J±(t),x(t)) -11 H(t,x(t)) dt. 
It turns out that A(xo, H) depends only on the fixed point Xo and the map 'PH 
and is independent of the choice of the function H generating the map. 
Lemma 1. If Hand K in 1i generate the sante map, i.e., 'PH = 'PK then 
A(xo, H) = A(xo, K) 
for every Xo E Fix('PH) = Fix('PK). 
Proof. Define the piecewise smooth arc t ~ 'ljJt by 
'ljJt = 'Pk, for t E [O,IJ 
'ljJt = 'P'it, for t E [1,2J. 
Thus for every x E R2n the map t ~ 'ljJt(x) from [0,2J into R2n is a loop and we 
set 
~(x) = 12 ~(-J±(t),x(t)) dt -1
1 H(t,x(t)) dt + 12 K(2 - t,x(t)) dt 
where x(t) = 'ljJt(x). This map x ~ ~(x) is evidently smooth and by differentiation 
in x we obtain 
~I(x)h = 
f~ ( -J±(t), d'ljJt(x)h) dt 
fol ('\1H(t,x(t)),d'ljJt(x)h) dt 
+ t ('\1 K(2 - t, x(t)), d'ljJt(x)h) dt, 
which is equal to 0, since t ~ 'ljJt(x) is a solution of the Hamiltonian system 
associated to H between [O,IJ and to -K(2 - t,.) between [1, 2J. For Ixllarge we 
have ~(x) = 0, since H and K are compactly supported so that x(t) == x for 
t E [0,2J. This shows that ~ == 0. 
Hence if Xo E Fix('PH) then A(xo,H) - A(xo,K) = ~(xo) = ° as claimed .• 
In view of the lemma we can associate with a fixed point Xo of the map 'ljJ E V 
the action A( Xo, 'ljJ) defined by 
A(xo,'ljJ) = A(xo,H), 
if'ljJ = 'PH.

Definition. The action spectrum of cp E D is the set 0"( cp) c lR defined by 
O"(cp) = {A(x,cp) I x E Fix(cp)}. 
Clearly 0 E 0"( cp) since the Hamiltonians have compact supports. We shall show 
that the action spectrum is invariant under symplectic conjugation. More generally, 
denote by 9 the group of conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms. By definition, 
fJ E 9 satisfies 
(5.15) 
fJ*w = aw 
for some constant a = a(fJ) E (0, (0). Note that if cp = CPH, then 
(5.16) 
Proposition 7. If cp E D and fJ E 9 with fJ* w = aw then 
In particular, 
Proof. Assume cp = CPH and choose x E Fix(cp). In view of Lemma 1 and (5.16) 
we have to show that A(fJ(x),aH-o) = aA(x,H). We set 
x(t) 
cpk(x) 
y(t) 
fJ( x(t)) = fJ 0 cpk 0 fJ- 1 ({}(x)) = CP~H.9 (fJ(x)). 
Let ,\ be a primitve of w, i.e., d'\ = w, then fJ*'\ - a'\ = dF for a function F. Since 
the integral of a closed form over a loop vanishes, we find

The following property of the action spectrum will be crucial later on. 
Proposition 8. The action spectrum 0"( cp) is compact and nowhere dense. 

5.2 THE ACTION SPECTRUM OF A HAMILTONIAN MAP 
153 
Proof. We first show that O"(cp) is compact. Assume cp = CPH and recall that for 
Xo E Fix(cp) the loop x(t) = cpk(xo) is a solution of 
i;(t) = XH(X(t)), and x(l) = x(o) = Xo. 
Since H has compact support we find an R > ° 
such that x(t) = Xo is constant for 
Ixol 2': R and hence A(xo, cp) = 0. It is, therefore, sufficient to consider fixed points 
Xo for which Ix(t)1 :s: R. It then follows that A(xo, cp) :s: M for all Xo E Fix(cp) so 
that O"(cp) is bounded. To prove the compactness we consider a sequence Xj(t) of 
solutions corresponding to the fixed points Xj = Xj(O) and satisfying IXj(t)1 :s: R. 
By means of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem we find a subsequence satisfying Xj(t) ---; 
x*(t) in COO([0,1J,]R2n) and x*(O) = x* E Fix(cp). Consequently A(xj,cp) ---; 
A( x* , cp) implying the compactness of 0"( cp). 
It remains to prove that O"(cp) is nowhere dense. We first remark that the loop 
satisfying x(l) = x(O) = Xo is an element of the Sobolev space E = H1/2(Sl,]R2n) 
introduced in Chapter 3. Indeed, its Fourier coefficients Xk E ]R2n are, after two 
partial integrations, estimated by 
for k E Z. Moreover, as in Chapter 3, one verifies that these special loops are 
precisely the critical points of the variational functional 
where now H E Hand 
bH(x) = 11 H(t,x(t)) dt. 
Consequently A(xo, cp) = aH(x), with x(t) = cpk(xo), is a critical level of aH. In 
order to show that the set d cp) of critical levels is nowhere dense, we follow an idea 
due to J.C. Sikorav [198] and construct a smooth function on ]R2n whose critical 
levels contain d cp). We extend the function (t, xo) f--+ cpk (xo) : [0, 1] x Fix( cp) ---; 
]R2n to a smooth function 'ljJ : [0,1] X ]R2n ---; ]R2n satisfying 
'ljJ(t,xo) 
'ljJ(I, x) 
'ljJ(0, x) 
forallxE]R2n. 
To do so simply take a smooth f : [0,1] ---; [0,1] which is equal to 1 near ° and 
equal to ° near 1 and set 

154 
CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
where cpt = cpk. For every x E JR2n , the map t t----+ '¢( t, x) represents a loop belonging 
to E and we can define the smooth function W : JR2n ----+ E by setting w(x)(t) = 
'¢(t, x). Using now the fact (proved in Appendix 3), that aH E COO(E, JR) we have 
a smooth function defined by 
It has the property that every Xo E Fix( cp) is a critical point of aH 0 w. In addition, 
A(xo, cp) = aH 0 w(xo) is a critical level. Since by Sard's theorem the set of critical 
levels of aH 0 W is nowhere dense, we conclude that also u( cp) is nowhere dense. 
This finishes the proof of the proposition .• 
Over the group V we can define the action spectrum bundle A ----+ V by 
A = U {cp} x u(cp) , 
<pE1J 
equipped with the metric induced from (V, d) x JR. Every fibre is a compact nowhere 
dense set; a generic fibre consists of isolated points except possibly the point O. 
Since 0 E u( cp) for every cp E V there is a trivial continuous section of A. The 
action spectrum u( cp) does not depend continuously on cp E V. In the next two 
sections we shall construct a nontrivial continuous section 
'Y : V -------+ A, 
i.e., 'Y(cp) E u(cp) and 'Y ¢ o. It is, in addition, monotone and invariant under 
symplectic conjugation. The existence of this distinguished continuous section is 
established by means of a minimax argument for the action functional. 
5.3 
A "universal" variational principle 
The results in the first section are based on a variational principle to which we 
will now turn. Our aim is to establish the existence of a special critical point of 
the action functional 
aH(x) = a(x) - bH(X), x E E 
introduced in Chapter 3. In contrast to the principle used there, we shall design 
a minimax principle which is independent of the choice of H E 1t. Recall that 
E is the Hilbert space E = H 1/ 2 (81, JR2n) which splits into an orthogonal sum 
E = E- EB EO EB E+, and, if x = x- + xO + x+, then 
and 

5.3 A "UNIVERSAL" VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE 
155 
As in Chapter 3 one verifies that the special solutions x E COO([O, 1J,JR2n ) 
x(t) = ~k(xo) and Xo E Fix(~H) 
ofthe Hamiltonian equation x = XH(X) agree with the critical points of aH on E. 
We shall single out a family F of subsets FeE such that for every H E 1t 
'Y(H) := sup inf aH(x) 
FEF xEF 
is a real number and a critical value of aH. The crucial point will be that F is 
independent of the choice of H E 1t and therefore a "universal" minimax set for 1t. 
Later on this will be important for us for the following reason: whenever one has 
a family of functionals together with a "universal" minimax set F, we conclude 
from the pointwise estimate II> :<:::: "Ill for two functionals in our family the same 
inequality for the associated minimax values. Note that 
where x+ E E+, while 
with a constant M depending on H. 
In order to define F we first introduce a distinguished group of homeomor-
phisms of E, which is prompted by the structure of the gradient flows of aH. 
Definition. We define a set G of homeomorphisms of E as follows. A homeomor-
phism h belongs to G if hand h- 1 map bounded sets onto bounded sets and there 
exist continuous maps 'Y± : E --+ JR and k : E --+ E mapping bounded sets into 
precompact sets and such that there exist r = r( h) satisfying 
for all x E E+ with Ilxll ~ r. Moreover, 
h(x) = e'Y+(x)x+ + xO + e'Y-(x)x- + k(x) 
for all x E E. 
Lemma 2. G is a group. 
Proof. We have to show that with h,g E G also h-1 and hog E G. By assumption 
on h we have 

156 
CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
Hence 
e-'Y-(X) P- h(x) + pOh(x) + e-'Y+(x) P+h(x) 
_(e-'Y-(x) P- + pO + e-'Y+(x) P+)k(x). 
Writing x = h-1(y) and y = h(x) we obtain for y = y- + yO + y+ 
e-'Y-(h-1(y»y- + yO + e-'Y+(h-1(y»y+

eU-(Y)y- + yO + eU+(Y)y+ + k(y). 
Using the properties of 'Y± and k together with the fact that h -1 maps bounded 
sets into bounded sets we conclude that a± and k have the desired properties and 
h-1 E G. Similarly one verifies that hog E G .• 
The distinguished family F of subsets of E is defined by 
The crucial topological property of G lies in the following intersection result which 
is intuitively clear: 
Lemma 3. If h E G, then 
Proof. We have to find x E E+ satisfying P+h(x) 
e'Y+(x)x + P+k(x) = 0 and x E E+, or 
o. This is equivalent to 
The operator T : E+ -+ E+ maps E+ into a precompact subset of E+ and hence 
T : B -+ B for a sufficiently large ball B, so that Schauder's fixed point theorem 
guarantees a solution proving the lemma .•

If 'Y(H) = 0, then 'Y(H) is a critical level which contains in particular all the 
constant solutions outside of the support of H. We, therefore, only have to show 
that 'Y(H) i= 0 is a critical value of aH. For this we need the following compactness 
property. 
Lemma 5. Assume 'Y(H) i= 0 and assume the sequence Xj E E satisfies 
VaH(Xj) ---+ 0, and aH(Xj) ---+ 'Y(H). 
Then Xj possesses a convergent subsequence. 
Proof. We recall from Chapter 3 that 
VaH(x) = x+ - X- - VbH(x), 
where VbH : E ---+ E is globally Lipschitz continuous and maps bounded sets into 
precompact sets. Moreover VbH(x) = j*VH(x) with the L2-gradient VH(x) of 
bH . 
Assume that the sequence Xj E E is bounded in E. Then VbH(xj) is pre-
compact and taking a subsequence we may assume that V'bH(xj) ---+ y in E. By 
assumption VaH(Xj) ---+ 0 so that xi -xi ---+ y. In addition, since dim EO < 00, we 
find a subsequence such that also x~ converges and we see that Xj has a convergent 
subsequence. 
Therefore, we only have to prove that the sequence Xj is bounded. Arguing in-
directly we may assume by taking a subsequence that Ilxjll---+ +00. Since H E 1t 
the sequence VH(xj) is bounded in L2 so that VbH(Xj) = j*VH(xj) is precom-
pact in E. Hence, taking a subsequence, xi - xi ---+ y in E and also in L2. This 
implies that Ix~1 ---+ 00. Consequently we find a subsequence such that pointwise 
IXj(t)l---+ 00, for a.e. t 
implying that H(t, Xj(t)) ---+ 0 for a.e. t. Hence by Lebesgue's theorem, bH(Xj) ---+ o. 
Also V H (t, x j (t)) ---+ 0 for a.e. t so that V H (x j) ---+ 0 in L2 and consequently 
VbH(Xj) ---+ 0 in E. From VaH(Xj) ---+ 0 we now conclude that xi - xi ---+ o. 
Hence 
aH(Xj) = a(xj) - bH(xj) ---+ O. 
This contradicts the assumption that aH(Xj) ---+ 'Y(H) i= 0 and shows that the 
sequence Xj is bounded. The proof of the lemma is finished .• 
We are ready to finish the proof of Theorem 4 which we reformulate as 

5.3 A "UNIVERSAL" VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE 
159 
Lemma 6. The real number ,(H) is a critical value of aH, for every H E 1t. 
Proof. Recall that ,(H) is a real number in view of Lemma 4. If ,(H) = 0 there is 
nothing to prove and we assume ,(H) f=. O. In this case the Palais-Smale condition 
as formulated in Lemma 5 holds. Arguing by contradiction we assume that ,(H) 
is not a critical value of aH. Then, in view of Lemma 5, we find an f > 0 satisfying 
(5.17) 
In order to first slow down the gradient flow we take a smooth map a : lR --t [O,lJ 
satisfying 
aCt) 
1, if t E [,(H) - f, ,(H) + fJ 
aCt) 
0, if t E lR \ b(H) - 2f,,(H) + 2fJ 
and define a( x) = a( a H (x)), for x E E. The flow of the modified gradient equation 
(5.18) 
:i; = a(x)V'aH(x) =: Vex) 
on E 
exists for all times and we shall denote it by 
(s,x) f--+ X· s: lR x E --t E. 
Using this flow we pick T = ~ and define the homeomorphism h of E by setting 
(5.19) 
hex) = X· T, x E E. 
By definition of ,(H) there exists an F E :F satisfying 
Fe {x I aH(x) ~ ,(H) -f}, 
and we shall demonstrate that 
(5.20) 
h(F) c {x I aH(x) ~ ,(H) + f}. 
Postponing the proof we first show how the lemma is concluded. By definition of 
:F we have F = g(E+). Therefore, if h E G (a fact which will be proved later 
on), then also hog E G since G is a group in view of Lemma 2. Consequently 
h(F) = h 0 g(E+) E:F and we arrive at the contradiction 
,(H) ~ inf aH(h(F)) ~ ,(H) + f, 
hence concluding the lemma. In order to verify (5.20) we prove that 
(5.21) 
Arguing by contradiction, we assume that aH(h(x)) < ')'(H)+f. Since s f--+ aH(x,s) 
is monotone-increasing we have 

160 
CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
for all 0 ::; s ::; T. Therefore, aH(x· s) E b(H) - E, ,(H) + EJ so that a(x· s) = 1 
for 0 ::; s ::; T. We see that in this time interval x(s) := X· s solves the gradient 
equation x = Va H (x). Hence using the estimate (5.17) for the gradient: 
,(H) + E > 
aH(h(x)) = aH(x· T) 
aH(x) + !aT IVaH(x· sWds 
~ ,(H) -
E + TE2 = ,(H) + E, 
which is a contradiction. The statement (5.21) is verified and it remains to show 
that hE G. 
Recall that 
(5.22) 
V(x) = -a(x)x- + a(x)x+ - a(x)VbH(x). 
In order to find a representation formula for the flow of x = V (x) on E, we consider 
for x E E fixed, the equation 
(5.23) 
where Ax(s) = -a(x·s)P- +a(x·s)P+ is a time-dependent but linear vector field 
on E, and where fx(s) = -a(x· s)VbH(x· s). If u(s) is a solution of (5.23) with 
initial value u(O) = x, then u(s) = X· s by the uniqueness theorem of ordinary 
differential equations. The variation of constant formula for the solutions of (5.23) 
gives now the following representation for the flow of the equation x = V(x): 
x· t

_. el'-(x)x- + x O + el'+(x)x+ + k(x). 
We shall show that for every t E lR. this flow map belongs to the group G. Since 
the vector field V is globally Lipschitz continuous, it maps bounded sets in E into 
bounded sets. This holds true, of course, also for the inverse map. Note that there 
exists an r > 0 such that if x E E+ satisfies Ilxll ~ r then aH(x) ~ ,(H) +2E, and, 
therefore, a(x) = 0 and consequently V(x) = O. Hence a(x . s) = 0 for all s E lR. 
and all x E E+ satisfying Ilxll ~ r. We conclude that ,±(x) = 0 and k(x) = 0 
for x E E+ satisfying Ilxll ~ r. Finally, the desired compactness properties for the 
map k follow from the compactness of the map VbH and we have proved that the 
flow maps indeed belong to G. This finishes the proof of the lemma and the proof 
of Theorem 4 is complete .•

5.4 A continuous section of the action spectrum bundle 
Exploiting the fact that the minimax set F is the same for every H E H we first 
derive some properties of the function 
"I: H 1-+ JR, H 1-+ 'Y(H) 
where 'Y(H) = sUPPEFinf aH(F). We first prove that the function "I is non-
negative continuous and monotone-decreasing: 
Proposition 9.

"I ~ 0 and "1(0) = 0 
(ii)

Proof. For every x E E

implying the estimate (ii). Since for every x E E we have aH(x) 2: aK(x) if H ::; K 
the monotonicity (iii) of "I follows. In order to prove "1(0) = 0 we observe that 
"1(0) = sup inf a(F) ~ inf a(E+) = 0, 
PEF 
and, since F n (E- EEl EO) -=I- 0 for F E F, 
inf a(F) :::; sup a(E- EEl EO) = 0, 
implying that "1(0) = O. Finally, in order to prove that 'Y(H) ~ 0 for H E H, we 
define for fixed Xo E JR2n \ {O} and T E JR the family HT E H of functions by 
HT(t,x) = H(t,x - TXo). 
Defining the symplectic map {} by {}(x) = x + TXo we have 'PHr = {}'PH{}-l. If 
O"('P) denotes the action spectrum of 'P E V introduced in Section 5.2 we conclude 
from Proposition 7 that O"('PHJ = O"('PH). By definition, 'Y(HT ) E O"('PHJ and,

therefore, ,(HT ) E 0"( 'PH ).Since T f---> ,(HT ) is continuous with image in a nowhere 
dense set (Proposition 8) it must be constant, so that 
,(H) = ,(HT ) for all T E R 
Hence it is sufficient to estimate ,(HT) for T large. Observing that SUPP(HT) for 
T -+ 00 moves to "infinity" in x we can estimate for T large 
HT(t,x) :::; 7rlxl 2 
for all (t, x) E [0,1] X lR2n. Consequently, recalling that IIxlli2 = ~Ixj 12 and a(x) = 
7r~jlxjl, for x E E+, 
implying that ,(H) 2: 0 as claimed. This finishes the proof of Proposition 9 .• 
If, for example, H 2: 0, then we conclude by monotonicity that 0 :::; ,(H) :::; 
,(0) = 0 implying ,(H) = O. This proves the first part of 
Proposition 10. 
If H 
> 0 
If H 
< 0 and H i- 0 
then ,(H) = O. 
then ,(H) > O. 
Proof. Assume H :::; 0 and H i- O. Then we find a bump function a i- 0 with 
o :::; a(t) :::; 1 and a time-independent G E C~(lR2n) with G :::; 0 and G i- 0 such 
that 
K(t, x) = a(t)G(x) 
satisfies, for E > 0 and small, 
H(t,x):::; EK(t,x). 
By monotonicity, ,(H) 2: ,(EK) and we shall show that ,(EK) > O. By translation, 
as in the proof of the previous proposition, we can assume that G(O) = inf G < 0, 
so that 
m(t)G(x) :::; m(t)G(O) + 7rlxl 2

The distinguished critical level "((H) of the function aH belongs, by construc-
tion, to the action spectrum of the associated time-1 maps rp H. We shall show next 
that it only depends on the time-1 map and not on the particular choice of the 
Hamiltonian H generating the maps. 
Proposition 11. Assume H, K E 'H, then 
rpH = rpK

Pr-ooj. The proof is based on a homotopy argument and we start with a preliminary 
observation. Two arcs '1/;6 and 'l/;t in A are called homotopic if there is a smooth 
map 
[0,1] x [0,1] -7 V: (8, t) f-+ 'I/;~ 
connecting the arcs in A. We then find a smooth H : [0,1] x [0,1] X ]R2n -7 ]R of 
compact support satisfying 
'I/;~(x) = rpk. (x), 
where Hs(t, x) = H(8, t, x). Assume now '1/;; = 'I/; for all ° 
~ 8 ~ 1; then 
Since 0'('1/;) is nowhere dense (by Proposition 8) the continuous function 8 f-+ "((Hs) 
is constant so that "((Ho) = "((Hd. The idea of the proof is now as follows, assum-
ing 
rpH = rpK = 'I/; 
we shall homotope rpk and rpk to arcs rpk, and rpk, such that 
b(H) - "((K)I = b(H') - "((K') I ~ IIH' - Kill 
is small. In order to carry out the argument we first, by reparametrizing the time, 
homotope the arc rpk to an arc rpt satisfying rpt = rpl = 'I/; for ~ ::; t ::; 1 and we 
do the same for the arc rpk. Hence we can assume that

Proof. The statement (i) is proved in Proposition 9 (ii). If <P = <PH and'l/J = <PK 
then 11'( <p) -,( 'l/J) I ::; IIH - KII in view of Proposition 9. This proves the statement 
(ii) in view of the definition of the distance d( <p, 'l/J) as reformulated in (5.9). Now 
we prove (iii). By definition we find H ::; 0 satisfying <PH = 'l/J-l 0 <po Take L such 
that 'l/J = 'l/JL, hence <P = <PL 0 <PH = <PL#H. Since H::; 0 we have L#H - L ::; O. 
Now we make use of the following observation: if'l/J = <PA and <P = <PB for two 
Hamiltonians A, B E H satisfying A ?: B, then aA ::; aB pointwise for the asso-
ciated functionals; consequently we conclude from the minimax characterization 
of, that ,('l/J) = ,(A) ::; ,(B) = ,(<p). Hence the monotonicity statement in (iii) 
follows. The statement (iv) is proved by the same homotopy argument as in the 
beginning of the proof of Proposition 11. The last statement is a consequence ofthe 
definition of " in view of Lemma 6 and Proposition 11. The proof of Proposition

Recall that the partial order structure on V introduced in Section 5.1 is based 
on this fact. Note also that the real number ,( <p) belongs to the action spectrum 
cr(<p) = {A(x,<p) I <p(x) = x} associated to the fixed point set of the map <po If Xo 
is a trivial fixed point of <P = <PH, i.e., satisfies (t,xo) 1c supp (H) for 0::; t:S 1, 
then A( xo, <p) = O. We see that the statement ,( <p) > 0 refers to nontrivial fixed 
points of <po 
Summarizing, Proposition 12 and Proposition 13 show that , : V -; A is a 
nontrivial (r =J. 0) and continuous section of the action spectrum bundle A -; V. 
In addition, , is monotone with respect to the order structure on the group V and 
invariant under symplectic conjugation.

this theorem we shall proceed in several steps, first defining the positive and the 
negative energy functions E± : V ---+ ]R+ by

and hence equal to 'Y("p) , in view of CPo = id, proving the proposition .• 
The following immediate consequence of the lemma will be crucial for the proof 
of Theorem 5. 
Proposition 15. Assume that cP,,,p E 1) meet the assumptions of Lemma 7, i.e., there 
is an open bounded subset U C ]R.2n such that cP = CPH with supp(H) C [0,1] x U

Proof. Since, by Lemma 7, 'Y("p) = 'Y(cpo"p), we find in view of Proposition 14 that

It is possible to compute the energy E("p) and 'Y("p) for those "p E 1) which are 
generated by special time-independent Hamiltonians.

Proof of Theorem 5. Recall first the definition of the capacity co(U) where U is 
an open subset of ~2n. Define the set Ha (U) of admissible Hamiltonian functions 
as follows: H E Ha(U) if H E c;;",(~2n), supp(H) c U and H ::::: 0, moreover, 
H(x) = - inf H for x in an open set and all the T-periodic solutions of x = XH(X) 
of periods 0 < T ::::: 1 are constants. Then 
co(U) = sup{IIHIII HE Ha(U)}. 
Note that IIHII = - inf H = m(H) in the notation of Chapter 3. 
Assume now that 'ljJ E V satisfies 'ljJ(U) n U = 0. Then U is bounded, since 'ljJ 
has compact support and hence co(U) < 00. Picking E > 0, we find H E Ha(U) 
satisfying

Setting cp = cp H we have, by Proposition 16, that 'Y( cp)

I 'IjJ E D, and 'IjJ(A) n A = 0}. 
e(B) = sup{ e(A) I A c B and A bounded }. 
Clearly e is monotone in the sense that if A c B then e(A) :; e(B). For every 
symplectic diffeomorphism f) of ]R2n we have e( f)(A)) = e(A). This follows from 
E(f) 0 'IjJ 0 f)-I) = E('IjJ). Moreover, e(U) > 0 for every open set U. Indeed the 
following more quantitative statement follows immediately from Theorem 5. 
Theorem 7. For every open U 
CO(U) < e(U). 
More explicitly, we have the estimate 
sup{ IIHIII HE Ha(U)} :; inf{ IIHIII H E H,'ljJH(U) n U = 0}. 

5.5 AN INEQUALITY BETWEEN THE DISPLACEMENT ENERGY ... 
171 
This estimate is much stronger than it looks at first sight. We shall see, in 
particular, that the existence of the capacity Co, namely co(B(l)) = 71" = co(Z(l)) 
is an immediate consequence of the estimate. Recall that this normalization of Co 
was the subtle part in the construction of Co which required an existence proof. 
We point out that the capacity Co explained not only all the symplectic rigidity 
phenomena discussed in Chapter 2 but also the existence phenomena for periodic 
orbits in Chapter 4. 
Corollary. For the open ball B = B(l) and the open cylinder Z = Z(l) we have 
71" ::=; co(B) ::=; e(B) ::=; e(Z) ::=; 71". 
Proof. In view of Theorem 7 and the monotonicity of e, only the first and the 
last inequality have to be proved. The first one is Lemma 3 of Chapter 3 which 
required the construction of an easy example. It remains to prove that e(Z) ::=; 71". 
For this it is sufficient to show that 
for every radius R > 1. To displace this set from itself, it is enough to displace 
B2(1) C ]R2 from itself. To do so we first take an area- and orientation-preserving 
diffeomorphism cp of]R2 mapping B2(1) into a square of side length y'7r + E.

A translation in the y direction which displaces the square from itself requires 
a Hamiltonian which has a slope close to y'7r, for example HI (x, y) = (y'7r + 2E) . x. 
By smoothly cutting off this Hamiltonian, we see that we can separate the square 
from itself by a Hamiltonian H E 1i with norm IIHII as close as we wish to 71". The 
desired flow cp-l 0 cpt 0 cp then displaces B2(1) from itself in time 1, proving the 
claim and hence the corollary .• 
As indicated in Fig. 5.5, this construction shows also that, by cutting a given 
bounded set V into small disjoint cubes and after removing a set 11;, C V of 
arbitrary small measure, the remaining set V \ 11;, can be displaced from itself by 
arbitrary small energy.

Definition. A special capacity c for open sets in ]R2n is a map c, associating to an 
open set U, a number c(U) or +00 such that 
(A.l) 
(A.2) 
c(U) > 0 if U -=I- 0 and c(B2(1) X ]R2n-2) < 00. 
If 'IjJ : ]R2n ~ ]R2n is a diffeomorphism satisfying 
'IjJ*w = aw for some a -=I- 0 and 'IjJ(U) c V 
then lalc(U) :S c(V). 
Evidently every capacity is a special capacity. However, in contrast to the 
axioms of the capacity in Chapter 2, the maps 'IjJ in (A.2) are required to be 
defined on all of ]R2n. 
Theorem 8. The displacement energy e is a special capacity in ]R2n satisfying, in 
addition, e(B(I)) = 7f = e(Z(I)). 
Proof. It remains to prove that e satisfies A.2. Assume that 1jJ satisfies 1jJ*w = aw. 
Then E(1jJtp1jJ-l) = laIE(tp) for tp E D. If tp(U) n U = 0 then 1jJtp1jJ-l(1jJ(U)) n 
1jJ(U) = 0, implying that e(1jJ(U)) = lale(U). If now U c V then e(U) :S e(V) so 
that 1jJ(U) c V implies e( 1jJ(U)) = lale(U) :S e(V) as desired .• 
It should be mentioned that e is not a capacity as defined in Chapter 2, and 
Co -=I- e. Indeed, consider an annulus A in ]R2. 
Then co(A) = 7f(R2 - r2), i.e., is the area of A. If 1jJ(A) n A = 0 for 1jJ E D 
which is, by definition, defined on all of]R2, then necessarily 1jJ(B(R)) n B(R) = 0. 
Using that 'IjJ is an area-preserving map, this follows from topological reasons, and 
we see that 
e(A) = e(B(R)) = 7fR2 > co(A).

5.6 Comparison of the metric d on V with the CO-metric 
In order to understand the metric d introduced on V in Section 5.1, it is useful 
to compare it with more familiar metrics. One can ask, for example, whether a 
symplectic map which is CD-close to the identity mapping can be generated by a 
CO-small Hamiltonian. This is not necessarily so as we shall show by means of an 
example in ]R2. We shall construct a sequence 'ljJn E V satisfying

Let 'l/Jn = rpHn E V be the maps generated by Hn. Since the set Un in Fig. 
5.8 is displaced from itself by 'l/Jn we can estimate, in view of Theorem 8, that 
d('l/Jn, id) = E('l/Jn) ~ co(Un) = n. On the other hand I'l/Jn - idleo ~ ~ proving the 
claim (5.26). 
For the example it is important that the diameters of the supports of the 
maps 'l/Jn grow. Indeed, there is no such example if we keep the supports uniformly 
bounded. This follows from the following estimate due to H. Hofer in [117]: 
Theorem 9. For every rp, 'l/J E V 
d(rp,'l/J) ~ C 
diametersupp(rp'l/J-l) Irp-'l/Jleo 
where C is a constant and C ~ 128. 
The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of this statement which 
compares the intrinsic metric d with the CO-metric. We need some technical prepa-
rations and start with a definition. The notation in the following refers to the 
symplectic splitting R2n = R2 E9 ... E9 R2 and the coordinates (Xl, Yl, ... , Xn, Yn). 
If a E R we shall denote by {Xl = a} the hyperplane {(x,y) E R2nlxl = a}. 
Definition. Denote by 8 1, ... ,8k any subsets of R2n. We call them properly sepa-
rated, if for every choice Aj C 8j of bounded subsets, there exist a map T E V and 
numbers al < a2 < ... < ak-l such that the sets T(Aj) lie in different components 
of R2n\ uJ:I {Xl = aj}. Relabeling the sets we can assume that T(Aj) is to the

Lemma 8. Assume the sets SI, ... Sk are bounded and already properly separated 
by parallel hyperplanes. Then, given R > 0, there exist a map T = TR E V and 
vectors VI, V2, ... ,Vk E lR2n , with VI = 0, satisfying 
T(X) = X + Vj 
if x E Sj 
for all 1 5:. j 5:. k and 
Proof. Choosing ° = al < a2 < ... < ak, we introduce the vectors 
where el = (1,0,0, ... 0) and the translated sets 
sj : = Sj + tVj. 
For every t ~ ° these sets are mutually disjoint and separated by hyperplanes. 
The mutual distances go to infinity as t ---+ 00. Define the function 
k 
H : U {t} x (U Sj) ---+ lR 
t~O 
j=1 
by setting H(t,x,y) = ajYl if (x,y) E Sj. We can consider H as a restriction of 
a smooth Hamiltonian function on lR X lR2n having compact support in the space 
variables for t in a compact interval. If we take aj = R(j - 1), the time t-map <pk 
acts on each set Sj as a translation Sj·t = Sj +tajel. Hence the mutual distances 
between the sets Sj . t are at least tR, thus proving the lemma .•

CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
Lemma 9. Assume 'ljJ1, 'ljJ2, ... , 'ljJk E V have properly separated supports. Then 
Note that these maps necessarily commute. 
Proof. Since the energy E is invariant under conjugation we may assume that 
we already have the supports of 'ljJj separated by parallel hyperplanes. A priori 
we cannot assume that the generating Hamiltonians have disjoint supports. We, 
therefore, use a trick. Let 'ljJj = 'PHj and denote the support by Sj = supp ('ljJj). 
Choose R > 0 such that 
where xj E Sj. Now choose vectors Vj such that the sets BR(Sj +Vj) are disjoint. If 
T E V is the map associated to the Sj guaranteed by Lemma 8, we set ~j = T'ljJjT-1 
and find 
E('ljJ1'ljJ2··· 'ljJk) = E(~1~2 ... ~k). 
By construction, supp(~j) = T(Sj) = Sj + Vj. Observe now that miraculously 
-¢j(x) = T'ljJjT-1(X) = 'ljJj(x - Vj) + Vj = Tj'ljJjTj- 1(X) 
for all x E ]R2n, with the translation Tj(X) = x + Vj. Therefore, in view of the 
transformation law of Hamiltonian vector fields, 
~j = 'PHj 
with Hj(t,x) = Hj(t,x - Vj). 
By construction, supp( Hj ) are now mutually disjoint and hence 
~1 ~2 ... ~k = 'PH 
with H = HI + H2 + ... + Hk. Given c > 0, we choose H j such that IIHjl1 < 
E('ljJj) + c, so that

It is useful for the following to introduce a refinement of the displacement 
energy. If S C 1R2n is any subset we define the proper displacement energy ep(S) 
as 
ep(S) = inf{a > 0 I for every bounded subset A c S 
there exists 'l/J E V satisfying E( 'l/J) ~ a and 
A and 'l/J(A) are properly separated }. 
One verifies, as in the previous section, that ep is a special capacity for sets in 
1R2n which satisfies, in addition, ep (B(I)) = 7r = ep(Z(I)). It is an astonishing 
observation that the energy of a mapping 'l/J E V can be estimated through the 
proper displacement energy of the smallest support needed in order to generate 
the map by a Hamiltonian. This was discovered by J.C. Sikorav in [198]: 
Theorem 10. (J.C. Sikorav) If HE 1i satisfies supp(H) C [0,1] x U, then 
E('PH) ~ 16ep (U). 
Proof. Denote by 'Pk the time evolution of the map 'PH. Given E: > 0, we take N 
so large that the maps 'l/Jk defined by 
satisfy 
'l/Jk = 'Pt;;, with tk

Here S C 1R2n is a bounded subset of U. By definition of ep there exists a 'P E V 
such that Sand 'P( S) are properly separated and 
We next construct a distinguished sequence of mappings 'Pj E V for 0 ~ j ~ 
2N. If j = 0, 1 we set 'Po = id and 'PI = 'P. In order to define 'P2, we first choose a 
map U2 E V as in the proof of Lemma 8 which satisfies for s E S 
with a vector V2 E 1R2n. 
Setting 'P2 = U2'Pu:;l, we have for s E S that 'P2(S) = U2('P(S)) = 'P(s) + V2· 
Similarly, we construct all the maps 'Pj by

E(ak(3k) '.5: 4E(<p) '.5: 4ep (U) + 4c:.

ated by a Hamiltonian F E 1-£, r,oT = r,o'F having its support contained in [0,1] x C. 
Cutting off this function smoothly, we find a new Hamiltonian K satisfying

In view of (5.31) we conclude for the time I-maps that r,oKIQ = r,oFIQ = "pIQ. 
Moreover, supp(K) c ([0,1] x B6(Q)) n supp(F) c [0,1] x (B6(Q) n C) and 
hence SUpp(r,oK) c B6(Q) n C. We can apply Sikorav's theorem and find E(r,oK) ~ 
16ep(B6(Q) n C). Setting r,o = r,oK E V the lemma is proved .• 
We shall need another consequence of Sikorav's theorem. 
Lemma 11. Assume "p E V and supp("p) C U. If U = (aI, a2) x (bl , b2) EB 1R2n- 2, 
then 
Proof. Since U is convex we construct, as in the first part of the above proof, a 
Hamiltonian H E 1-£ satisfying supp( H) C [0, 1] x U and generating "p = r,o H . 
One verifies easily, by arguing as in the proof of the Corollary to Theorem 7, that 
ep(U) 
= 
(a2 - al)(b2 - bt) so that the lemma is a consequence of Sikorav's 
theorem above .• 
Proof of Theorem 9. We consider "p E V with "p i= id and choose

Defining the sequence aj by ao = ° and ak+l = ak + 28, we set 
Qk = [(ak-c,ak+c) XIR] EB1R2n- 2 
with ° < 10 < (8 - d). Since supp('¢) is compact, the index set I, 
is a finite set. Choose now d < 81 < (8 - c). In view of the localization Lemma 10

sets SUpp(<pk) are also. Abbreviating

We see that the map '¢fJ is the identity map on disjoint strips, hence it leaves every 
gap in between invariant so that it can be written as a composition of maps having 
their supports in the gaps. More precisely there exists a finite sequence <Pj E V,

This holds true for every 8 > d = 1'1/1 - idleo, and we conclude that 
E('I/I) :::; 128R 1'1/1 - idleo, 
where R = diameter supp('I/I). Observing that Icp'l/l-l_idle o = ICP-'I/Ileo, we finally 
arrive at the desired estimate 
and the proof of Theorem 9 is finished .• 
Finally, we shall complete the proof of Theorem 1 by proving the estimate 
(5.33) E('I/I):::; 16inf{7rr2 1 there is a cP E V with supp (cp'l/Jcp-1) C Z(r)} , 
for every '1/1 E V. Given c > 0, we pick a map '19 E V and R > 0 satisfying 
supp('I9'1/1'19- 1 ) C Z(R) and 
7rR2 - c :::; inf{7rr2 I there is a cP E V with supp(cp'l/lcp-1) C Z(r)}. 
Since E( '1/1) = E( '19'1/1'19- 1 ) we may assume without loss of generality that supp( '1/1) C 
Z(R). Choosing now H E 1i with 'I/IH = '1/1, we consider the corresponding arc 
t t-t 'I/It and define for s > 0 
For a suitable function t t-t s(t) we find an arc t t-t 'I/I:(t) = 1[;t which is generated 
by a Hamiltonian function K E 1i satisfying supp(K) C [0,1] x Z(R) and 1[;1 = '1/1. 
Therefore, in view of Sikorav's estimate 
using that the proper displacement energy of Z (R) is equal to 7r R2. Since c > 0 was 
arbitrarily chosen the announced estimate (5.33) follows and the proof of Theorem 
1 is finally completed. 
5.7 Fixed points and geodesics on V 
A symplectic diffeomorphism cp E V possesses, as we have demonstrated, a dis-
tinguished fixed point x = cp(x) guaranteed by the minimax principle. Its action 
satisfies A(x, cp) = 'Y( cp). Periodic points are fixed points x = cpN (x) of higher 
iterates of cp and we call the finite set 
O(x) = {x, cp(x), cp(cp(x)), ... , cpN (x) = x} 
the orbit of x. The following qualitative existence theorem is due to C. Viterbo 
[218]. 

5.7 FIXED POINTS AND GEODESICS ON V

Theorem 11. Every I.{) E V- \ {id} possesses infinitely many periodic points Xj = 
~ 
(Xj) having positive actions 
and disjoint orbits 
The statement also holds if I.{) E V+ \ {id}. Actually, by using his homological 
version of a special capacity in ]R2n, C. Viterbo proved a more general statement 
assuming merely that I.{) E V satisfies I.{) # id. 
Proof. In view of the assumption on I.{) we find HE H satisfying I.{) = I.{)H and H ::; 0 
with H # o. Hence ')'(1.{)) > 0 in view of Proposition 13. Since supp(H) C [0,1] xU 
for some bounded open U, we have 
o < ')'(1.{)) ::; e(U). 
Indeed, if 'lj; E V satisfies 'lj;(U) n U = 0 then, in view of Proposition 15, ')'(1.{)) ::; 
E( 'lj;) implying that ')'(1.{)) ::; e(U). Since I.{) ::; id, we find, using the monotonicity of 
,)" the estimate 
o < ')'(1.{)) ::; ')'(I.{)2) ::; ... ::; ')'( v;1) ::; e( U) 
for all the iterates of I.{). For every j there is a fixed point Xj = ~(Xj) satisfying 
')'(~) = A(xj,~) 2 ')'(1.{)) > 0, and it remains to show that infinitely many of 
them belong to disjoint periodic orbits. To see this observe that if Xk = I.{)1(Xj) for 
some l, then 
as the computation shows, so that the theorem follows in view of the above bound 
for the sequence ')'(~) .• 
If the time-independent Hamiltonian function H E Cg<'(]R2n) does not vanish 
then the Hamiltonian system :i; = XH(X) possesses many periodic solutions lying 
on regular energy surfaces of H, as we have seen in Chapter 4. Nothing is known, 
however, about their periods and we would like to add a qualitative existence 
statement for fast periodic solutions. Recall that if H E Cg<'(U) satisfies IIHII > 
eo(U), then the system :i; = XH(x) possesses a nonconstant T-periodic solution 
where the period is contained in the interval 0 < T ::; 1, provided H ::; 0 and 
H = inf H on an open subset. This follows immediately from the definition of the 
capacity co(U). Generalizing this statement we shall prove: 
Theorem 12. Assume H E Cg<'(U) does not vanish. Then the Hamiltonian system 
:i; = XH(X) has a nonconstant T-periodic solution with 0 < T::; T*, where 
T* > eo(U)

CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
Proof. By using the arguments of Chapter 5, the proof will follow readily from 
the definition of the capacity Co. Let H+ = max. Hand H- = - min H, then 
IHleo = max.{H+,H-}. Assume H+ ~ H- so that H+ > 0 since H to. Choose 
c > 0 so small that T*(H+ - c) > co(U). Next choose a smooth function f : JR---> 
[0, (0) satisfying f(8) = 0 if 8 ~ 0 and f(8) = H+ - c if 8 ~ H+ and moreover 
o ~ f' (8) ~ 1. Then define the Hamiltonian K by 
K = T* foH. 
Since IIKII > co(U) there exists a nonconstant r-periodic solution x(t) of 
of period 0 < r ~ 1. The function T* f'(H(x(t))) = c is a positive constant, 
hence y(t) = x( ~t) is a nonconstant periodic solution of iJ = XH(y) having period 
cr ~ T*. The same argument applies if H- ~ H+ and the statement is proved .• 
With a smooth arc I.pt : [a, b) ---> V, we associate its length by defining 
b 
length (I.p(a,bj) = J 
[s~p Ht -
i~f Ht)dt. 
a 
The function H is the unique smooth function on [a, b) X JR2n of compact support 
which generates the arc and which is determined by (9tl.pt)o(I.pt)-l(X) = JV H(t, x) 
for a ~ t ~ b. In the metric space (V, d) we then call a smooth path I.pt : [a, bj ---> V 
a geodesic path if, locally, its length is the shortest connection of the endpoints; 
i.e., if 
length (I.p(t,sj) = d( I.pt, I.pS) 
for all a ~ t < 8 ~ b with It -
81 sufficiently small. Examples of geodesics are the 
flows for time-independent Hamiltonians H E C,;"'(JR2n), as we shall show. In this 
case it follows from the definition that 
Proposition 17. If HE C,;"'(JR2n) is independent of time, then the flow I.pt = I.pk is 
a geodesic in V which moreover satisfies 
for all t < 8 satisfying It -
81 < 2;:, where h:= sUPx IHxxl. 
Proof. We recall first that a T -
periodic solution of a time-independent vector 
field is necessarily a constant solution if the period is too small. Indeed assume 
x(t) is a T- periodic solution of x = XH(X). Normalizing the period we define 
y(t) = x(tT), which solves 
iJ = XTH(y), and y(O) = y(I).

Note that for every I-periodic loop z in ]R2n having mean value zero, we have the 
L2_ estimate Ilzll :::; 2~ Ilili. This is seen by looking at the Fourier series. Applying 
this observation to if whose mean value vanishes, we can estimate 
11Th 
Ilifll :::; 27flliill = 27fT '1IHxx(y(t))iJll :::; 27f IliJll, 
which implies if = 0 if hT < 27f, so that y(t) = y(O) is a constant solution. 
Therefore, if hT < 27f, we conclude from Proposition 16 that E('PTH) = TIIHII. 
Hence assuming It - sl < ~, we can compute the distance as 
E(('Ps)-l 0 'Pt) 
E('Pt;;S) = E('P(t-s)H) = It - siIIHII, 
as claimed in the proposition .• 
Evidently, for autonomous Hamiltonians, 
d( 'Pt , id) = t11H11 = length ('P[O,t]) 
as long as 'Pt admits no nontrivial fixed point. By definition, a geodesic in D 
minimizes locally the length of the curve. Globally this need not be true as the 
following example shows. 
Proposition 18. For every E > 0 there exists a geodesic path 'Pt in D for 0 :::; t :::; 1 
starting at 'Po = id and satisfying, for all 0 :::; t :::; 1, 
d( 'Pt ,id) :::; E and length ('P[O,t]) 2': !. 
E 
Proof. Pick an open neighborhood U of the origin satisfying 16e(U) < E and choose 
a time-independent H E C;:O(U) with IIHII > ~. Then, by Sikorav's estimate, we 
find if 0 :::; t :::; 1, that d( 'Pt , id) = E( 'PtH) :::; 16e(U) < E, while length ('P[O,t]) = 
t11H11 2': ~ as claimed .• 
We see in particular that the metric space (D, d) is not a "flat" space. "Locally" 
however the space (D, d) is "flat". This has been proved recently by M. Bialy 
and L. Polterovich [22], who gave a complete description of a geodesic path in 
(D, d) which we shall describe next. In order to avoid pathologies, we consider 
only smooth paths g : I ----t D, with I c ]R an interval, which are regular. This 
requires that the Hamiltonian H : I X ]R2n ----t ]R generating the path g satisfies 
IIHtl1 -I=- 0, for tEl. Recall that Ht(x) = H(t,x) and, as above 
IIHtl1 = maxHt(x)

Definition. A regular smooth path g : I ----7 V is called a minimal geodesic if for all 
a, bE I, with a < b, 
Recall that the length is defined by 
b 
length (gl[a,bj): = J IIHtiidt , 
a 
where H E 1i generates the path g. Consequently g : I ----7 V is a geodesic path if for 
every c E I there is an interval Ie C I such that g : Ie ----7 V is a minimal geodesic. 
In order to characterize geodesics in terms of their generating Hamiltonians, the 
following concepts introduced in [22J turn out to be useful. 
Definition. A smooth Hamiltonian H : I X ~2n ----7 ~ is called quasi-autonomous if 
there exists two points x+, x_ E ~2n satisfying 
for all t E I 
for all t E I . 
Correspondingly a function H on I X ~2n is called locally quasi-autonomous if, for 
every C E I, there is an interval Ie C I such that H is quasi-autonomous on Ie x~2n. 
Special examples are of course autonomous Hamiltonians. Denote by C = c;;:, (JRn) 
the linear space of autonomous Hamiltonians equipped with the metric associated 
to the norm IIHII = maxH -minH. We call a smooth nonvanishing arc f: I ----7 C 
a minimal geodesic of C if for every a < b in I, we have 
b 
Ilf(b) - f(a)11 = J 
II :8f(8)11 d8 . 
a 
In this terminology a Hamiltonian H E 1i is quasi-autonomous precisely if it is 
the time derivative of a geodesic arc in C, in view of Lemma 13 below. 
The following theorem extends Proposition 17 and gives a complete description 
of geodesics on (V, d). 
Theorem 13. (Bialy-Polterovich) A regular smooth path g : I ----7 V is geodesic if 
and only if it is generated by a locally quasi-autonomous Hamiltonian. 
The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of this theorem. The result will be 
deduced from a criterion for minimal geodesics which we formulate first. Recall that 
with a map cp E V we have associated in Section 5.2 its action spectrum u( cp) = 
{A(x, cp)lx E Fix(cp)}. The action spectrum is a compact and nowhere dense set, 
as we have seen in Proposition 8. In general, it does not depend continuously on

<po To a smooth path 9 : [a, b] -+ V there belongs a bifurcation diagram ~(g). It is 
defined as the set 
~(g) : = ((t,s) E 1R2 1 a < t:::; band s E a(g(t)g(a)-l)}. 
If the path 9 : [a, b] -+ V is generated by a quasi-autonomous Hamiltonian H, we 
have the distinguished fixed points x+, x_ E Fix(g( t )g( a) -1) for every a :::; t :::; b. 
Their actions are the functions ,+,'-:

Note that I-(t) :::; 0:::; I+(t). The corresponding graphs r ±(t) = (~, I±(t)) are two 
distinguished curves in the bifurcation diagram which are contim~ous. Of course, 
the curve r(t) = (t,O) is always contained in ~(g) since the Hamiltonians consid-
ered have compact supports. 
Definition. Consider a regular path 9 : [a, b] -+ V generated by a quasi-autonomous 
Hamiltonian. Then its bifurcation diagram ~(g) is called simple if the following 
conditions are satisfied. 
(i) Whenever I+(t) does not vanish identically the following holds true for every 
r > a. There is no continous curve (t,u(t)) C ~(g),r:::; t:::; b connecting the point 
(r, u(r)) E r +(r) with a point (b, u(b)) where I_(b) < u(b) < I+(b). 
(ii) Similarly we require for every r > a, whenever 1_ (t) is not identically 0, that 
there is no continuous curve (t,u(t)) C ~(g),r :::; t :::; b connecting (r,u(r)) E 
r _(r) with (b,u(b)) satisfying I-(b) < u(b) < I+(b). 
The first of the figures in Fig. 5.10 illustrates a diagram which is not simple. 
The second figure belongs to a regular path 9 : [0, b] -+ V starting for simplic-
ity's sake at the identity, whose generating Hamiltonian H does not depend on 
time t, and which, moreover, does not admit any nonconstant periodic orbits. In 
this example the fixed points are the critical points x of H and their actions are 
the lines 
t 
A(x,g(t)) = - J H(x)dt = -tH(x). 
o 
The corresponding bifurcation diagram is simple because the critical levels of H 
are nowhere dense. 
Theorem 14. (Bialy-Polterovich) Assume the regular smooth path 9 : I -+ V is 
generated by a quasi-autonomous Hamiltonian. If the bifurcation diagram ~(g) is 
simple, then 9 is a minimal geodesic.

Proof. The proof is based on the properties of the distinguished map "( : V -+ lR 
introduced in Section 5.3 above. This map is, in particular, continuous and hence 
defines a continuous section of the bifurcation diagram. To simplify matters we 
assume that I = [0,1] and g(O) = id. The crucial step is the following lemma which 
extends Proposition 16. 
Lemma 12. Assume H is quasi-autonomous and generates a path 9 : [0, 1] -+ V 
with a simple bifurcation diagram I;(g). Then 
Proof. Recall that ,,(_(t) ::; "((g(t)) ::; "(+(t) for all t, in view of Lemma 4. First 
we prove that "((g( T)) = "(+ (T) if T > 0 sufficiently small. Reparameterizing, we 
introduce F(t, x) = TH(Tt,X) for 0 ::; t ::; 1 and T > O. We may assume that 
x_ = 0 so that F(t, x) ::; F(t, 0) + 7rlxl 2 if T is sufficiently small. Proceeding as in 
the proof of Proposition 10, we use the monotonicity of "( and estimate 
1 
T 
"((9(T)) = "((F) ~ - J F(t,O)dt = - J H(t,O)dt = "(+(T) . 
o 
0 
Hence "((g(T)) = "(+(T) as claimed. Similarly, "((g(T)-l) ~ -"(_(T) provided T 
is sufficiently small. The statements for t = 1 now follow from the assumptions 
on I;(g). Indeed, if "(+(t) == 0 then H(t, x) ~ 0 and hence by monotonicity of 
"( (Proposition 10) "((g(I)) = 0 as desired. Assume now "(+(t) ¢ O. Proceeding 
indirectly, we assume that "((g(I)) < "(+(1) and claim that "(-(1) < "((g(I)) < 
"(+(1). Indeed, ih- (1) == 0, then H(t, x) ::; 0 and hence "((g(I)) > 0 by Proposition 
10. If "(-(1) < 0 we just note that "( ~ 0 and the claim is proved. Consider now

the graph r defined by the continuous function u(t) = min{-y(g(t)),1'+(t)}, for 
T 
~ t ~ 1. Then r c E(g) and we arrive at a contradiction to the required 
simplicity of E(g). We have proved the first statement in the lemma; similarly one 
obtains the second statement .• 
The proof of Theorem 14 follows now in view of Proposition 14; abbreviating 
g(l) = rp we can estimate 
1'+(1) - 1'-(1) < 1'(rp) + 1'(rp-l) ~ d(id, rp) ~ 
< 
length (gl[o,I]) = 1'+(1) - 1'_(1) , 
where we have used in the last equality that the Hamiltonian is quasi-autonomous. 
We conclude that d(id, rp) = length (gl[o,I]). Hence 9 is a minimal geodesic and the 
proof of Theorem 14 is completed .• 
A technically convenient way to describe a small neighborhood of a point rp E 1) 
uses the linear space of generating functions which is explained in Appendix 1. 
Assume rp E 1) is near the identity mapping and, in symplectic coordinates, given 
by rp : (x, y) f--+ (~, 1/) = rp( x, y) E ]R2n. Then it can implicitly be represented in 
terms of a single function 8 by the relations 
x 
(5.34) 
~ + ty 8(~,y) 
y + te 8(~,y) , 
where 8 E C,;"'(]R2n) is also of compact support and small in the C2-sense. Con-
versely every such function 8 defines by means ofthe formula (5.34), a symplectic 
map rp E 1) near the identity. We, therefore, have a mapping 
<I> : 8 f--+ <I>(8) E 1) , 
defined in a small neighborhood of zero in C,;"'(]R2n). To an arc 8t(~, y) = 8(t,~, y), 
tEl, there belongs a path g(t) = <I>(8t ) E 1) for tEl. It is generated by a 
Hamiltonian H E 1-£. Its relation to 8t is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation 
H(t,~,y + :~8(t,~,y)) = 
:t8(t,~,y), 
which holds true in our situation for all (~, y) E ]R2n. This is, of course, well-known, 
and we refer to the book by C.L. Siegel and J. Moser [196]. In the linear space 
C,;"'(]R2n) of generating functions we introduce the norm 11811 := max 8 - min 8 
and the associated metric do (80 , 81) := 1180 - 81 11. The arc length of a smooth arc 
8t , a ~ t ~ b is, therefore, defined by

CHAPTER 5 COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS 
A smooth arc St, tEl is called a minimal geodesic, if for every a, bEl, a < b, we 
have do(Sa, Sb) = length (S[a,b)) or, explicitly, if 
b 
liSa - Sbll = J 
11~~lldt for all a < b, 
a 
a, bEl. Examples of minimal geodesics are straight lines (1 - t)Sa + tSb = St 
connecting two points Sa and Sb. Lemma 13 below expresses the fact that a smooth 
arc St is a minimal geodesic if and only if ~~ is quasi-autonomous. It will turn 
out that the image of a geodesic under the map <P is a geodesic in the metric 
space (V, d). Indeed we shall deduce from Theorem 14 that <P is an isometry. This 
shows, in particular, that the metric space (V, d) is "locally flat" if one considers 
the space (ego (]R2n) , II . II) as a "flat" space. 
Theorem 15. 
Proof. Define the arc St = (1-t)SO+tS1' 0 ~ t ~ 1 connecting So with Sl. We shall 
prove that the path g(t) := <p(St) is a minimal geodesic in (V, d). It connects g(O) = 
<p(So) with g(1) = <P(Sl). In order to verify the assumptions of Theorem 14 we 
shall prove that E(g) is simple and the generating Hamiltonian quasi-autonomous. 
Consider a fixed point (e,'f/) E ]R2n of g(r)g(O)-l, i.e., g(r)g(O)-l(e,'f/) = (e,'f/) 
for some 0 < r ~ 1 fixed. Introducing (e, 'f/) = g(O)(x, y), this is equivalent to the 
conditions 
(e,'f/) = g(r)(x,y) = g(O)(x,y). 
Expressed in terms of the generating functions Sr of g(r), respectively, So of g(O) 
by means of the formula (5.34), this is equivalent to 
x 
e + ty Sr(e, y) 
y + te Sr(e,y) 
e + ty So(e, y) 
y + te So (e, y) . 
Consequently '\1Sr(e, y) = '\180(e, y) and hence '\1 (So -Sl)(e, y) = 0 and, reversing 
the steps, g(t)g(O)-l(e, 'f/) = (e, 'f/) for all t. We have verified that the periodic 
solutions of H correspond one-to-one to the critical points of the function So - Sl 
and are, moreover, all constant. From the Hamilton-Jacobi equation we deduce for 
the critical points (e, 'f/) = g(O)(x, y), that 
Hence, the Hamiltonian function is quasi-autonomous. The action of a fixed point 
p = (e,'f/) which corresponds to the critical point (e,y) of 8 1 -

and the proof of Theorem 15 is completed .• 
In order to deduce Theorem 13 from Theorem 15, we start with two technical 
observations. In order to check that a function is quasi-autonomous the following 
lemma is helpful. 
Lemma 13. A smooth function H : [a, b] X 1R2n --+ IR of compact support is quasi-
autonomous if and only if 
b "l H(t,x)dtll· 
a 
a 
Proof. Clearly, if H is quasi-autonomous, the equation follows from the definition of 
the norm. Assuming the equality to hold we now show that H is quasi-autonomous. 
By definition, there exists a compact set K C 1R2n containing the supports of H t 
for every t. Defining the closed sets 
Kt = {x E K I Ht(x) = maxHt} , 
a:::; t:::; b, 
we have to prove that n K t =f. 0, where a :::; t :::; b. Since K has the finite intersection 
property it suffices to verify that Kit n ... n KtN =f. 0 for every finite sequence 
t1 < t2 < ... < tN. Arguing by contradiction, we assume Ktl n ... n KtN = 0. 
Thus we find an E: > 0 satisfying 
N

L Htj(x) + E: < L maxHtj

Arguing similarly for the minimum, the proof is completed .• 
Lemma 14. Consider an arc St, t E I = [a, b] and the corresponding arc Ht, t E I 
generating the path g(t) = <I>(St) in V. Then ~~ is quasi-autonomous in I if and 
only if H is quasi-autonomous in I. Moreover, in this case the distinguished points 
P± = 
(~±, '1]±) respectively Q± = 
(~±, Y±) of min and max for H respectively 
~~, are related by (5.34), the generating function being S = Sa. In addition 
H(t, P±) = ~~ (t, Q±) for all t E I. 
Proof. If H is quasi-autonomous with respect to the distinguished points P±, then 
g(t)g(O)-l(p±) = P± for all a :::; t :::; b. Hence, arguing as in the proof of Theorem 
15, \lSt(Q±) is independent of t and so \lSt(Q±) = \lSa(Q±). Consequently ttS 
is quasi-autonomous in view of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Conversely, if ~~ 
takes on its max and min at the fixed points Q±, then St - Sa also takes on its 
min and max at these points, for all t E I. Hence \lSt(Q±) = \lSa(Q±) and 
consequently g(t)g(O)-l(P±) = P±. In view of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the 
function H is quasi-autonomous with respect to P± .• 
Proof of Theorem 13. The metric in (V, d) is bi-invariant and hence we may con-
sider a path g(t) E V near the identity g(O) = id, where t E [-E, E] = I for a 
sufficiently small E > O. It is generated by H E Hand g(t) = <I>(St) , t E I for an 
arc St of generating functions. We have to show that g is a minimal geodesic in 
(V, d) if and only if H, or equivalently ~~ (by Lemma 14), is quasi-autonomous. 
But by Lemma 13, ~~ is quasi-autonomous if and only if

Chapter 6 
The Arnold conjecture, Floer homology and 
symplectic homology 
In the sixties V.l. Arnold announced several seminal and fruitful conjectures in 
symplectic topology. This chapter is devoted to his conjecture about fixed points 
of symplectic mappings which originates in questions of celestial mechanics dating 
back to the turn of the century. Reformulated dynamically, this conjecture gives 
a lower bound for the number of global forced oscillations of a time-dependent 
Hamiltonian vector field on a compact symplectic manifold in terms of the topol-
ogy of this manifold. Forced oscillations are singled out by the action principle; 
solutions of the conjecture gave rise to new ideas and techniques in the calculus 
of variations and in nonlinear elliptic systems. In particular, it prompted A. Floer 
1986 to the construction of his homology theory. 
We shall describe in the following the history of the Arnold conjecture and start 
with a proof for the special case of the standard torus T 2n in Section 6.2. Here we 
can make use of the action principle in the H 1/ 2 setting as introduced in Chapter 3. 
But this time the aim is to find all its critical points. Our strategy is inspired by C. 
Conley's topological approach to dynamical systems: we shall study the structure 
of the set of all bounded solutions of the regularized gradient equation belonging 
to the action functional defined on the contractible loops of T2n. This invariant set 
consists of the critical points together with all their connecting orbits. This way 
the study of the gradient flow in the infinite dimensional loop space is reduced to 
the study of a gradient like continuous flow of a compact metric space whose rest 
points are the desired critical points. It turns out that the compact space contains 
the cohomology of the torus. The number of rest points is then estimated by the 
Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory presented in Section 6.3. 
A reinterpretation of the geometric ideas underlying the proof of the torus case 
in terms of partial differential equations will lead us in Section 6.4 to the proof of 
the Arnold conjecture for the larger class of compact symplectic manifolds (M, w) 
satisfying [wll7r2(M) = O. In this general case there is no natural regularization 
and we are forced to investigate the structure of the bounded solutions of the 
not regularized gradient system. They are smooth solutions of a special system 
of first order elliptic partial differential equations of Cauchy-Riemann type. These 
solutions are related to M. Gromov's pseudo holomorphic curves in (M,w). The 
crucial compactness of the solution set will be established by means of an analytical 
technique sometimes called bubbling off analysis. In order to get an insight into 
the topology of the solution set we shall use an approximation procedure. We 
approximate the bounded solutions by solutions of a special elliptic boundary value

CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
problem, to which we can apply Fredholm theory based on the Cauchy-Riemann 
operator. Using the continuity property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology we 
then deduce the Arnold conjecture by the Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory as in the 
torus case. 
Assuming, in addition, all the forced oscillations to be nondegenerate, the geo-
metric ideas will lead us in Section 6.5 to A. Floer's new approach to Morse theory 
and Floer homology. It makes use of an additional structure of the set of bounded 
solutions of the not regularized gradient equation: namely, since M is compact, 
there are only finitely many nondegenerate forced oscillations and every bounded 
solution of the gradient equation tends in forward and backward time asymptot-
ically (exponentially) to a specific forced oscillation of the Hamiltonian system. 
The I-dimensional connections determine an algebraic complex generated by the 
forced oscillations, its grading is defined by a Maslov-type index associated with a 
nondegenerate forced oscillation, which plays the role of the Morse index. We shall 
merely outline Floer's beautiful ideas. A combination of Floer's construction with 
our construction of the special capacity Co of Chapter 3 results in a symplectic 
homology theory which, however, is not yet in its final form. It will be sketched, 
without proofs, in Section 6.6. The technical requirements of these theories, in 
particular, the intricate transversality arguments are quite advanced and beyond 
the scope of this book. Chapter 6 is, in contrast to the previous chapters, not 
self-contained. 
6.1 
The Arnold conjecture on symplectic fixed points 
In his search for periodic solutions in the restricted three body problem of celestial 
mechanics, H. Poincare constructed an area-preserving section map of an annulus 
A on the energy surface. The annulus was bounded by the so-called direct and 
retrograde periodic orbits. It inspired him in 1912 to formulate the following the-
orem [177]. It is called the last geometric theorem of Poincare announced shortly 
before his death. It was later proved by G. Birkhoff. 
Theorem 1. (poincare-Birkhoft) Every area preserving and orientation preserving 
homeomorphism of an annulus A := 8 1 x [a, b] rotating the two boundaries in 
opposite directions possesses at least 2 fixed points in the interior (Fig.6.1). 
The strength of this theorem is that it provides at once infinitely many peri-
odic points if it is applied to the iterates, which leads to infinitely many periodic 
solutions in applications, see [24]. In 1913 G. Birkhoff [23] succeeded in proving 
this theorem by an ingenious but strictly two dimensional argument. Note that the 
theorem is global in nature; there are no interior assumptions required on the map-
ping. It is not a topological result: it is wrong if the area-preserving assumption 
is dropped. S. Lefschetz, who undoubtedly would have enjoyed demonstrating to 
Birkhoff that the famous Poincare-Birkhoff fixed point theorem is a trivial conse-

quence of his own topological fixed point theory, had to admit defeat: he could not 
apply his theory since the Euler characteristic of the annulus vanishes, X(A) = o. 
The Euler characteristic of the two sphere (X(82 ) = 2) does not vanish, hence 
by Lefschetz's theory every continuous map f of 8 2 homotopic to the identity 
possesses at least one fixed point, as is, of course, well-known. The map f may 
have only one fixed point, as for example, the translation z 1-+ z+l on the Riemann 
sphere shows: its only fixed point is the north pole at 00. 
Fig. 6.2 
It is, however, a striking fact that f possesses at least 2 fixed points if it is, in 
addition, area preserving. 
Theorem 2. (N. Nikishin, C. Simon, 1974) A homeomorphism f of 8 2 homotopic 
to the identity which preserves a regular measure p, has at least 2 fixed points. 
In particular, every diffeomorphism of 8 2 leaving an area form invariant f*w = w 
possesses at least 2 fixed points. 
Proof. The second statement is a consequence of the first one. Indeed, the map has 
degree 1, hence is homotopic to the identity by H. Hopf's theorem. To prove the 
first statement, assume P* E 8 2 is the fixed point of f guaranteed by the Lefschetz 
theory. Then the map g := fl(82\P*) can be identified with a homeomorphism of 
the plane ]R.2. If g had no fixed point then by Brouwer's translation theorem there 
would be an open set D having the property that gj(D) = fj(D) are mutually 

196 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
disjoint for all j > O. But then, since f preserves the measure 
n L p,(fj (D)) = (n + 1) p,(D) ~ p,(82 ) , 
j=O 
for every integer n ~ 1 and hence p,(D) = O. This contradicts the assumption that 
p,(U) does not vanish for an open set U .• 
The translation theorem of Brouwer is a very special two dimensional phe-
nomenon which attracted the attention of many mathematicians, [33,34,80, 101, 
109, 141, 206]. The same argument as in Theorem 2, used by C. Loewner in the 
sixties in his Stanford lectures, also shows that a measure-preserving homeomor-
phism of the open disc in the plane always possesses at least one fixed point. This 
is clearly false if the homeomorphism does not preserve a regular measure. The 
proofs by C. Simon [200] and N. Nikishin [169] of the theorem above use a differ-
ent argument. They show that the fixed point index j(P) for an area preserving 
diffeomorphism in the plane is less then or equal to 1. Thus the fixed point formula 
X(82 ) = 'L,j(P) requires at least 2 fixed points. 
V. Arnold observed in [11] that the Poincare-Birkhoff result could be derived 
from a fixed point theorem for the two dimensional torus T2 = ffi.2 I'll} constructed 
by gluing together two identical annuli along their boundaries; we refer to [46] for 
details. 
Fig. 6.3 
In contrast to 8 2 , the Lefschetz fixed point theory is not adequate for precisely 
this surface, since X(T2) = O. There are, indeed, area preserving diffeomorphisms 
of the torus without fixed points, as the translation maps on the covering space 
ffi.2 given by 
(6.1) 
x = x + Cl, 
Y = Y + C2, 
demonstrate. Consequently, the class of symplectic mappings on T2 needs to be 
restricted if it is required that they possess fixed points. With V. Arnold we con-
sider measure-preserving diffeomorphisms 'IjJ of T2 which are homologous to the 
identity map, and hence are, on ffi.2, given by 'IjJ : (x, y) I--t (X, Y): 
X 
x + p(x,y) 
(6.2) 
Y 
y + q(x,y)

with periodic functions p and q, we require that 'lj; preserves the center of mass, 
hence excluding in particular the translations. Summarizing, the diffeomorphisms 
'lj; of T2 are required to meet the following conditions 
(i) 
'lj; is homologous to the identity 
(ii) 
dX 1\ dY = dx 1\ dy 
(iii) 
J p = 0 = J q . 
T2 
T2 
Proposition 1. A diffeomorphism 'lj; of T2 satisfying (i)-(iii) possesses ~ 3 fixed 
points provided it is sufficiently close (in the C1 norm) to the identity. If, in 
addition, all the fixed points are nondegenerate, then 'lj; possesses ~ 4 fixed points. 
Proof. Since'lj; : (x, y) f-+ (X, Y) is sufficiently close to the identity map it can be 
represented by a generating function F : ]R.2 ---. ]R. in the implicit form 
X 
of 
= x+oY(x,Y) 
(6.3) 
of 
y = Y + ax (x, Y) , 
see Appendix 1. The gradient of F is periodic and it follows from assumption (iii) 
that the function F itself is periodic and hence is a function on T2. We conclude 
from (6.3) that the fixed points of 'lj; on T2 are in one-to-one correspondence with 
the critical points of the function F on T2. By the Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory 
every smooth function on the 2-torus possesses at least 3 critical points (see Section 
6.3 below), and by the Morse theory it possesses at least 4 critical points, if a priori 
we know that all the critical points are nondegenerate. The proposition follows .• 
There are, of course, symplectic maps on T2, even ones close to the identity 
having precisely 3 fixed points. To see this we take a smooth function G on T2 
with precisely 3 critical points. An example of such a function is 
G(x, y) = sin 7rX' sin 7rY' sin 7r(x + y) , 
whose level lines look as shown in Fig. 6.4. 
G has a maximum in the left triangle, a minimum in the right triangle and 
a monkey saddle in the corners of the unit square. If e > 0 is small, we define a 
map 'lj; : (x, y) ---. (X, Y) implicitly by (6.3) with the generating function F = eG. 
Then 'lj; is close to the identity, satisfies (i)-(iii), and has 3 fixed points, namely 
the critical points of G on T2. Similarly, the function G(x, y) = sin 27rx + sin 27rY 
defines a map 'lj; having 4 fixed points on T2 which are all nondegenerate .• 
The idea of relating fixed points of symplectic mappings to critical points of 
an associated function goes back to H. Poincare [176] and is used quite frequently 

198 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Fig. 6.4 
in order to establish local existence results. For example A. Weinstein [222, 224] 
makes use of it in order to show that a symplectic diffeomorphism of a compact and 
simply connected symplectic manifold M possesses at least as many fixed points 
as a function on M possesses critical points provided it is close to the identity 
map. For more general results and references we refer to J. Moser [165]. In sharp 
contrast to all these perturbation results, the Arnold conjecture we now turn to 
asks for fixed points of arbitrary symplectic mappings. For the special case of 
T2, V. Arnold conjectured in [10] that Proposition 1 holds without the restrictive 
assumption that '!jJ is close to the identity map. 
In order to introduce the restricted class of symplectic diffeomorphisms suitable 
for fixed point theory we first mention that for a diffeomorphism '!jJ on T2, the 
assumptions (i)-(iii) are equivalent to the requirement that '!jJ belongs to the flow 
of a time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field X H on T2. The proof is not easy and 
we refer to C. Conley and E. Zehnder, [55]. Hence'!jJ is a Hamiltonian map of T2 
in view of the following: 
Definition. Let (M, w) be a symplectic manifold. A diffeomorphism '!jJ of M is called 
Hamiltonian if it belongs to the flow of a time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field 
X H on M. To be more precise there exists a smooth function H : 8 1 X M ---+ IR 
such that '!jJ = cpl where the family cpt, t E IR of symplectic diffeomorphisms of M 
satisfies 
-it cpt 
XH( cpt) 
cpo 
id. 
In his thesis, A. Banyaga [16] shows that a map '!jJ is a Hamiltonian map if 
and only if it belongs to the commutator subgroup of the identity component 
of the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms of M. In addition, he proves that '!jJ 
is Hamiltonian if and only if the Calabi invariant of '!jJ vanishes. A Hamiltonian 
map being homotopic to the identity has, of course, a fixed point according to 
Lefschetz's theory provided the Euler characteristic X(M) does not vanish. 

6.1 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE ON SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
199 
The Arnold conjecture. Every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism 'Ij; of a compact sym-
plectic manifold (M, w) possesses at least as many fixed points as a function 
F : M -+ lR on M possesses critical points. 
In view of the Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory and the Morse theory for func-
tions on M we reformulate this conjecture in the following somewhat weaker form: 
# { fixed points of 'Ij;} 2: 
cup-length of M + 1, 
and, if a priori all the fixed points of 'Ij; are nondegenerate, 
> 
sum of the Betti numbers of M. 
Recall that a fixed point p of 'Ij; is called nondegenerate if 1 is not an eigenvalue of 
the linearized map d'lj;(p) E L(TpM). The cup-length of a manifold M is defined 
as the longest product in the cohomology ring: C L(M) = sup{ k13a1, a2, ... ak E 
H*(M) with dimaj 2: 1 such that a1 U a2 U ... U ak -I O}. Let SB(M) denote 
the sum of the Betti numbers f3k = dim Hk (M), 0 ::; k ::; dim M. Introducing the 
Poincare polynomial 
dimM 
P(t, M) 
L f3k tk, 
f3k = dim Hk(M) 
k=O 
we have SB(M) = P(I,M) and, of course, P(-I,M) = X(M) is the Euler char-
acteristic of M. In the special case of a 2n-dimensional torus T2n these topological 
invariants are CL(T2n) = 2n and SB(T2n) = 22n while X(T2n) = O. In particular, 
for T2 in Proposition 1 we see that 3 = CL(T2) + 1 and 4 = SB(T2). 
We prefer to reformulate the conjecture dynamically. A Hamiltonian map 'Ij; is, 
by definition, the time I-map of the flow of the Hamiltonian equation j; = XH(X) 
on M with a smooth function H : lR x M -+ lR periodic in time, H (t, x) = 
H(t + 1, x). Consequently, p is a fixed point of'lj; if and only if p = x(O) is the 
initial condition of a solution x(t) of the Hamiltonian equation which is periodic 
of period 1 and hence satisfies x(t + 1) = x(t) for all t E R Such a solution is 
also called a forced oscillation. Instead of looking for fixed points of a map, we can 
look as well for periodic solutions of a time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field; 
the Arnold conjecture formulates a universal lower bound on the number of forced 
oscillations in terms of topological invariants of the symplectic manifold. 
If (M, w) is a compact symplectic manifold and H : lR x M -+ lR a smooth time 
periodic function H(t + 1, x) = H(t, x), then for the time-dependent Hamiltonian 
equation 
the following holds: 
# {contractible I-periodic solutions} 2: CL(M) + 1. 
( 2: SB(M) if all the contractible I-periodic solutions are nondegenerate) . 

200 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Here a periodic solution x is called nondegenerate if 1 is not a Floquet multiplier 
of x. Since there are no assumptions on the function H, we only look for periodic 
solutions which are contractible. Indeed the arc length of a I-periodic solution 
x( t) is small if the Hamiltonian vector field is small, so that the orbit is necessarily 
contractible. This follows from the formula 
1 
1 
length (x) = J 1:i;(t)ldt = J IXH(X(t))ldt , 
o 
0 
where we have chosen a Riemannian metric on M. 
Take now an almost complex structure J on the symplectic manifold (M, w) 
satisfying wx(v, Ju) = gx(v, u) for all v, u E TxM, where 9 is a Riemannian metric 
on M. Then every Hamiltonian vector field X H on M is of the form 
:i; = JxVH(t, x) , 
x E M 
where the gradient of H with respect to x is defined by means of the associated 
Riemannian metric g. Assume now that H(t, x) = H(x) does not depend on the 
time and is, moreover, sufficiently small in the C 2 sense. Then every I-periodic 
solution x(t) is contractible and hence contained in a Darboux chart so that, by 
the argument in the proof of Proposition 17 in Chapter 5, it is necessarily constant, 
i.e., x(t) == x(O). Consequently, the I-periodic solutions are precisely the critical 
points of the function H : M ---* ffi. and the Arnold conjecture is reduced, in this 
special case, to the theories of Ljusternik-Schnirelman and Morse about critical 
points of functions. 
In the special case of a standard torus (T2n, wo), the Arnold conjecture was 
proved in 19S3 by C. Conley and E. Zehnder [55]. The proof is based on the action 
principle for forced oscillations. The same principle allowed A. Floer [S2], 19S6 
and J.C. Sikorav [19S] 19S5 to confirm the conjecture for large classes of sym-
plectic manifolds admitting compatible Riemannian structures with nonnegative 
sectional curvatures. These classes include, in particular, all oriented surfaces Sg 
with positive genus g.

6.1 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE ON SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
201 
The earlier proofs by Ya. Eliashberg for surfaces [77] are based on different 
ideas and were never published. The case 52 = Cpl was extended to higher 
dimensions by B. Fortune [93, 94] in 1985, who verified the conjecture for cpn 
with its standard symplectic structure. Accordingly every Hamiltonian map on 
cpn has 2: n + 1 fixed points. Note that in this case CL + 1 = 5E = X = n + 1, 
so that in the non degenerate case the result follows already from the Lefschetz 
theorem. A. Weinstein pointed out in [227]1986 that the Arnold conjecture is true 
for every symplectic manifold (M, w) if the Hamiltonian map 'IjJ is generated by 
a Hamiltonian vector field sufficiently small in the CO norm. We shall describe 
the more recent global results and developments in Sections 4 and 5. It will turn 
out, in particular, that the forced oscillations of a Hamiltonian vector field X H 
on a compact symplectic manifold are more intimately related to the topology of 
the underlying manifold M than it is suggested by the conjecture above. First we 
study in detail the model case of the standard torus. 
Before we turn to the proofs of the Arnold conjecture in higher dimensions, we 
would like to refer to some recent two dimensional results related to the Poincare-
Birkhoff theorem. As mentioned before, the Arnold conjecture for the two torus 
T2 may be viewed as a generalization of this theorem for diffeomorphisms and 
one may ask whether there is a topological analogue. Quite recently, P. Le Calvez 
[139] succeeded in proving that every homeomorphism of T2 homotopic to the 
identity, preserving a regular measure and preserving the center of gravity (i.e., 
there is a lift to JR2 satisfying the condition (iii) in (6.2) above) possesses at least 
three fixed points. Earlier M. Flucher [91] found two fixed points by extending 
techniques and arguments of J. Franks [96,97]. Attempts to generalize these results 
for homeomorphisms of higher dimensional tori must fail: on Tn, n 2: 3, there are 
measure-preserving diffeomorphisms satisfying the assumptions analogous to the 
T2 case without any fixed points, see M. Flucher [91]. An interesting modification 
of the Poincare-Birkhoff theorem for the annulus has been discovered by J .M. 
Gambaudo and P. Le Calvez [103] and, independently, by J. Franks [100]: 
Theorem 3. A diffeomorphism of the closed annulus A = JRjZ x [0,1], isotopic to 
the identity and preserving a regular measure, possesses infinitely many periodic 
orbits in the interior of A, provided it has a fixed point. 
This result has astonishing consequences. By introducing polar coordinates 
(r, tJ) in the neighborhood of a fixed point, one can blow up the fixed point into 
an invariant circle defined by r = O. Given two fixed points on a sphere 52, one 
obtains in this way a map of a closed annulus and hence deduces from Theorem 3 
the following: 
Corollary. Consider a C2-diffeomorphism of 52 preserving the orientation and 
preserving a regular measure. If it has 3 fixed points then it has infinitely many 
periodic orbits. 
In view of Theorem 2 such a diffeomorphism always has at least two fixed 
points and it is sufficient to assume one of them to be hyperbolic. Indeed, the 

202 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
blown up invariant circle of a hyperbolic fixed point contains 4 fixed points so that 
Theorem 3 applies. 
J. Franks used Theorem 3 for his breakthrough in an old problem of Rieman-
nian geometry. In [25] G. Birkhoff describes a reduction ofthe study ofthe geodesic 
flow on a Riemannian two-sphere to the study of an area preserving annulus map 
whose periodic points correspond to the closed geodesics. He showed, for positive 
Gaussian curvature, that, associated to a simple closed geodesic, such a Birkhoff 
annulus map is defined. Franks, assuming that 8 2 is equipped with a Riemannian 
metric having a simple closed geodesic for which the associated Birkhoff annu-
lus map is defined, demonstrates, that this map has a fixed point and hence, by 
Theorem 3, infinitely many periodic points. If, on the other hand, a Riemannian 
metric on 8 2 has no simple closed geodesic for which the Birkhoff annulus map 
is defined, then V. Bangert [15] established infinitely many closed geodesics by 
variational methods applied to the energy functional on the loop space of 8 2 . It is 
well known that every Riemann sphere possesses a simple closed geodesic. Hence, 
on a Riemann two-sphere there are always infinitely many closed geodesics which 
are distinct as point sets. 
References related to the Poincare-Birkhoff theorem and its generalizations are: 
[4, 35, 38, 49, 48, 61, 91, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 103, 109, 138, 140, 141, 139, 200, 206, 
143]. 
6.2 The model case of the torus 
We shall prove the Arnold conjecture for the standard torus (T2n, wo), where T2n = 
ffi.2n /7j}n and where Wo denotes the symplectic structure induced by the standard 
one from ffi.2n. A Hamiltonian vector field on this torus depending periodically on 
time is given simply by a smooth function H : ffi. X ffi.2n -+ ffi., (t,x) f---+ H(t,x) 
which is periodic in all its variables: 
(6.4) 
H(t + 1, x) = H(t, x) = H(t, x + j), 
all j E z2n . 
The associated Hamiltonian system is represented by 
(6.5) 
x=JVH(t,x), xEffi.2n. 
A periodic solution t f---+ x(t) = x(t + 1) E ffi.2n of (6.5) represents a contractible 
periodic solution of the vector field on T2n. In contrast, a solution of the form 
x(t) = jt + ~(t), with j 1:- 0 E z2n and ~(t) = ~(t + 1) represents a I-periodic 
solution on T 2n which is not contractible. Yet, such solutions might not exist 
on T 2n , as was explained in the previous section. We shall prove the following 
qualitative existence statement for Hamiltonian flows: 

6.2 THE MODEL CASE OF THE TORUS 
203 
Theorem 3. (C. Conley and E. Zehnder) Every smooth time periodic Hamiltonian 
vector field on the standard torus (T2n, wo) possesses at least 2n + 1 contractible 
I-periodic solutions (resp. at least 22n if all of them are nondegenerate). 
We shall merely consider the first statement which does not impose any as-
sumptions on the Hamiltonian on T2n. Our proof in the following is based on the 
action principle and is designed to illustrate, in the analytical framework of Chap-
ter 3, some of the underlying geometric ideas which will be used for a large class 
of symplectic manifolds described later. 
A contractible loop 8 1 ----t T 2n is the projection of a smooth loop x : 8 1 ----t JR.2n 
represented by its Fourier expansion 
(6.6) 
x(t) = L e27rk Jt Xk, 
Xk E JR.2n . 
kEZ 
Two such loops x and y on JR.2n induce the same contractible loop on T 2n iff 
x(t) - y(t) = j E z2n for all t E JR., so that Xk = Yk for k i=- 0 and Xo = Yo + j. 
Consequently, we can identify the space of smooth contractible loops on T2n with 
the space 
T 2n X E oo , 
where Eoo := {x E COO (81, JR.2n) I 101 x(t)dt = O}. This space is the quotient under 
the Z2n-action of the space JR.2n X Eoo ~ c oo (81,JR.2n). Using the same analytical 
framework as in Chapter 3, we now replace the space of smooth loops E OO by the 
Sobolev space 
(6.7) 
E 
1 
{x E H1/2(81, JR.2n) I J x(t)dt = O} ,

which has an orthogonal splitting E = E- Ef) E+ according to the decomposition 
x = L e27rk Jt Xk = L + L = x- + x+ . 
k#O 
k<O 
k>O 
We shall denote the loop space of JR.2n by fi = JR.2n X E and the loop space on T 2n 
by n = T 2n X E. The smooth action <p : fi ----t JR. is defined by 
(6.8) 
<p(x) = a(x) -
b(x) , 
x E fi 
where 
(6.9) 
stems from the symplectic structure, and where

CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
contains the given Hamiltonian H. Clearly, <p is invariant under the z2n action: 
<p(x + j) = <p(x),x E 0, and hence defines a smooth function on the loop space 
n = T 2n X E of contractible loops on the torus. We know from Chapter 3 that a 
critical point x E 0 of rp, 
(6.11) 
\7<p(x) = 0, 
is actually a smooth loop. The critical points are precisely the desired contractible 
periodic solutions of (6.5) we are looking for. We recall that the gradient of <p in 
H 1/ 2 is given by 
(6.12) 
\7rp(x) = -x- + x+ -
b'(x) , 
where we denote by b'(x) the gradient of b in Hl/2. Also recall that b'(x) = 
j* \7b(x), with the L2-gradient \7b(x) = \7H(x) E L2 of b, and j* : L2 ---; H 1/ 2 
the compact operator introduced in Chapter 3. Since H is a periodic function, its 
gradient on ]R2n is bounded and hence b' maps 0 into a compact subset of 0. In 
order to find the critical points of rp, we shall study the quite artificial gradient 
flow on the loop space defined by 
(6.13) 
d 
ds x = - \7rp(x) , 
x EO. 
The solutions x( s) = x . s of this smooth ordinary differential equation exist for 
all times since the gradient satisfies a uniform Lipschitz estimate (see Chapter 3). 
They are represented by 
X· s 
eS x- + xO + e-sx+ -
K(s,x) 
(6.14) 
K(s, x) : 
J (e S -
T p- + pO + e- S+T p+) b'(x· T)dT . 
o 
The linear operators P- ,po and p+ denote the orthogonal projections belonging 
to the splitting 0 = EO EB E- EB E+, where EO = ]R2n. In order to motivate our 
strategy to find critical points, we first consider a bounded orbit of the flow. By 
definition, such an orbit x . s satisfies 
(6.15) 
sup Irp(x· s)1 < 00.

For every T> 0,

6.2 THE MODEL CASE OF THE TORUS 
205 
Thus we find a sequence sn ---> 00 such that 'Vcp(x· sn) ---> 0 and cp(x· sn) ---> d E R 
Since cp satisfies the P.S. condition, a subsequence of x . Sn converges in n to a 
critical point y, 'Vcp(y) = 0, which, as we already pointed out, is a periodic solution 
of the Hamiltonian equation. Moreover, the set Cr( cp) of all critical points of cp is 
compact and one verifies readily that 
(6.18) 
x . S ---t Cr( cp) as S ---> ±oo 
for every bounded orbit of (6.13). We see that every bounded orbit comes from 
and tends to the set of critical points and hence is a so-called connecting orbit. 
As an illustration we consider the situation where the Hamiltonian H == 0 
vanishes. Here the flow on T 2n X E is determined by the symplectic structure 
alone and is explicitly given by 
where x = x- + xO + x+ E n. 
Fig. 6.6 
The bounded orbits coincide with the critical points xO E T2n which are the 
constant orbits. Moreover the torus T2n is a transversally hyperbolic invariant 
manifold of the flow. The general case is a "compact perturbation" of this picture. 
The set of bounded orbits is very small, most of the solutions of (6.13) are un-
bounded in forward and backward time. This is in sharp contrast to the behaviour 
of the flow of a variational principle bounded from below where every orbit of the 

206 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
negative gradient flow tends to the set of critical points in forward time. The clas-
sical example is the energy functional on the loop space of a compact Riemannian 
manifold in the geometric problem of closed geodesics, see W. Klingenberg [127] 
and V. Bangert [14]. 
Our strategy now is to study the structure of the set Xoo of bounded orbits 
of the gradient flow (6.13), i.e., the critical points together with the connecting 
orbits. We shall show that this set is a compact space which inherits the topology 
of the underlying manifold T2n. On this invariant set Xoo there is, moreover, a 
continuous gradient-like flow induced by the gradient flow (6.13), whose rest points 
are precisely the critical points of the functional. Theorem 3 will then follow from 
a well-known estimate for the rest points of a continuous gradient-like flow of a 
compact space which goes back to Ljusternik-Schnirelman. 
Fig. 6.7 
Proof of Theorem 3. We define the set )(00 of bounded solutions of the negative 
gradient equation (6.13) by 
(6.19) 
)(00 = {u E Coo (JR,JR2n X E) I 
%8 u( s) + V <p ( u( s)) = 0 for s E JR, ~~~ I 
<p ( u( s) ) I < 00 } . 
The set)(oo is equipped with the topology induced from Coo(JR,JR2n X E): namely 
that of uniform convergence of all derivatives on compact subsets of lR. Note that 
)(00 contains, in particular, the constant solutions satisfying u(s) = u(O) for all 
s E JR; they are critical points of <po On )(00 we have a natural action of z2n. 
Indeed, since the Hamiltonian is periodic, we conclude that <p( u + j) = <p( u) and 

6.2 THE MODEL CASE OF THE TORUS

'\lcp(u + j) = '\lcp(u) for all j. In the following we shall denote by Xoo the quotient 
space. It is defined by (6.20) with JR.2n replaced by JR.2n jz2n = T2n. Observe now 
that the gradient equation (6.13) is independent oftime, where the role ofthe time 
is played by the parameter s. Consequently, with s 1-+ u(s), also s 1-+ u(s + r) is 
a solution for every fixed r E R This shift in time induces a continuous JR.-action 
on X 00 defined by 
JR. X Xoo ---+ Xoo , (r, u) 1-+ r * u 
(6.20) 
(r*u)(s) = u(s+r). 
This flow has very special property: it is gradient-like with respect to the contin-
uous Ljapunov function 
(6.21) 
V: Xoo ---+ JR. defined by V(u) = cp( u(O)) . 
In order to prove this we have to show that the function V is strictly monotone 
decreasing along the nonconstant solutions r * u of the flow (6.20). If r > (1, then 
V(r*u) -
V((1*u) = cp(u(r)) -cp(u((1)) 
(6.22) 
= J ftcp(u(t)) dt 
a 
-J II'\lcp(u(t))Wdt 
a 
Consequently r 1-+ V(r * u) is monotone-decreasing. Assume now that V(r * u) = 
V((1*u) for some r > (1. Then cp(u(r)) = cp(u((1)) and hence, by (6.22), '\lcp(u(s)) = 
o for all (1 :::; s :::; r. Therefore, in view of the uniqueness of the solutions of the 
gradient equation, u(s) = u(O) for all s E JR. and hence r * u = u for all r E R 
Consequently, r * u is a constant orbit of the flow (6.20) and we have verified that 
V is a Ljapunov function for the continuous flow (6.20). 
Conversely, of course, if we have a constant orbit, i.e., r*u = u for r E JR., which 
is sometimes called a rest point of the flow (6.20), then u(s) == u(O) is a constant 
solution of the gradient flow (6.13) and hence a critical point of our functional cp. 
So far we do not even know whether Xoo is nonempty. In order to get an insight 
into the topology of the set X oo, we define the continuous map 
(6.23) 
p : Coo(JR., JR.2n X E) --t JR.2n 
associating with u the meanvalue of the loop u(O) En: 
1 
p(u) = J 
u(O)(t)dt E JR.2n . 
o 
With p : Coo (JR., T2n X E) we shall denote the map on the quotient space induced 
by p. It turns out, and this is the crucial step in the proof of Theorem 3, that the 
set X 00 inherits the topology of the underlying manifold T 2n : 

208 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Theorem 4. X 00 is a compact (metric) space and 
(6.24) 
is injective. Here and also in the following H* denotes the Alexander-Spanier 
cohomology with Z2 coefficients. 
Postponing for a moment the proof of this theorem, we first observe that The-
orem 3 can now be deduced from the following qualitative result of dynamical 
systems: 
Theorem 5. (Ljusternik-Schnirelman) Consider a continuous gradient-like flow on 
a compact metric space X; then 
# {rest points} 2:: CL(X) + 1. 
We shall prove Theorem 5 in the next section devoted to Ljusternik-Schnirelman 
theory. Recalling that the critical points of 'P are the rest points of the gradient-
like flow (6.20), we conclude from Theorem 5 applied to the compact space X = 
X oo , that #{ critical points of 'P} 2:: CL(Xoo) + 1. Now in view of Theorem 4, 
CL(Xoo ) 2:: CL(T2n). Since CL(T2n) = 2n we have established at least 2n + 1 
critical points of 'P. They correspond to the desired 2n + 1 periodic solutions of 
the Hamiltonian vector field and Theorem 3 is proved .• 
Proof of Theorem 4. The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of The-
orem 4. In order to get an insight into the topology of the set Xoo of bounded 
orbits of the gradient equation (6.13) we look for smooth compact submanifolds 
which "approximate" the set Xoo and whose topology can be estimated. The de-
sired cohomology of the set Xoo will then be concluded by means of the continuity 
property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology (see Appendix 7). 
If T > 0 we define a set XT consisting of solutions of a very special boundary 
value problem for the gradient equation: 
(6.25) 
X T : = 
{u E Coo ([-T, T]'ffi.2n X E) I

-T::; s::; T

ffi.2n X E-, 
u(T) 
E 
ffi.2n X E+ } . 
We have the natural z2n action on XT and denote by X T the quotient. It is defined 
by (6.25) with ffi.2n replaced by T2n. We shall investigate the set XT using standard 

6.2 THE MODEL CASE OF THE TORUS

methods of Fredholm theory. For this purpose we introduce the Banach spaces

{ u E CO ([ - T, T], ]R2n X E) } , 
equipped with the usual C 1 respectively CO norms. We denote by Band [ the 
quotients under the z2n action. These may be identified with the Banach manifolds 
defined by (6.26) with ]R2n replaced by T2n. Now define the nonlinear smooth map 
L: H----+£, uf--'tL(u) 
(6.27) 
L(u)(s) = is u(s) + V''P( u(s)) , -T:::; s :::; T . 
Then L(j * u) = L(u) and we shall denote by L : B ---t [ the induced map. In the 
following we shall use the abbreviation L( u) = U + V' 'P( u). Since the solutions of 
the smooth ordinary differential equation are smooth in time, we can represent the 
sets X T (respectively X T) as the solution set of L( u) = 0 (respectively L( u) = 0). 
(6.28)

X T = L- (0) and X T = L- (0) . 
Proposition 2. L is a nonlinear Fredholm map and the Fredholm index of the 
linearized map is 
ind L'(u) = 2n, 
u E B. 
Proof. From L(u) = u+u+ -u- -b'(u), we obtain for the linearized map at u E fj 
(6.29) 
L'(u)h = h + h+ - h- - b"(u)h , 
and we shall show first that the linear operator b" ( u) E .C( H, £) is compact for 
every u E f3. Since the derivative of a smooth compact map is compact, it is 
sufficient to verify that the map u f--'t b' (u) : H ---t £ is compact, i.e., maps bounded 
sets into precompact sets. Fix u E H; then recalling that b'(u(s)) = j*V'b(u(s)) we 
can estimate 
IIb'(u(s)) -b'(u(t))111/2 = 
11]* (V'b(u(s)) - V'b(u(t))) 111/2

CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
for a constant C depending only on the second derivative of the Hamiltonian 
function H. We conclude that b' maps a bounded subset of 8 into a set in £ 
which is equi-continuous, and since, for every fixed s, the set {b'(u(s))lu E 8} = 
{j*V'b(u(s))lu E 8} is precompact, we conclude by the Arzela-Ascoli theorem that 
b' maps indeed bounded sets into precompact sets. 
Using now that neither the Fredholm character nor the Fredholm index of a 
linear operator changes if we add a compact linear operator, it is sufficient to prove 
that the linear operator 
(6.30) 
is Fredholm of index 2n. For its kernel one verifies readily that ker(Lo) = {u E 
8Iu(s) = xO E ]R2n} consists of the constant functions with values in ]R2n X {O}, so 
that dimker(Lo) = 2n. Hence it suffices to show that Lo is surjective. Define for 
9 E £ the function u by 
s 
T 
u(s) = J {e- s+r g+(7) + gO(7) + es - r 9-(7)} d7 - J es - r g-(7) d7 . 
-T 
-T 
Then u satisfies the boundary conditions, i.e., u E 8 and moreover Lo(u) = 9 as 
is readily verified. This finishes the proof of the proposition .• 
Proposition 3. L: 8 -+ £ is a proper map modulo the z2n action, i.e., if Uk is a 
sequence satisfying L(Uk) -+ y, then there exists a sequence jk E z2n such that 
Uk + jk is precompact in B. 
Proof. Recall that L = Lo+b' and set L(un) = Yn. Then Lo(un) = Yn-b'(un). Since 
dim ker (Lo) < 00 there is a continuous splitting 8 = go EB fjl with 80 = ker(Lo), 
and Lo 181 is an isomorphism of Banach spaces. Now set Un = u~ + u~ E go EB 81 . 
Since b' (un) and hence Yn - b' (un) is bounded in £ we conclude that u~ is bounded 
in B. Pick a sequence jn E z2n such that u~ + jn is bounded in ]R2n. Then, by the 
compactness of b', the sequence 
is precompact in 8 so that u~ .!:' precompact in B. Hence after taking a subsequence 
we conclude Un + jn -+ U in B as claimed .• 
Passing to Band e, we conclude from Proposition 2 and Proposition 3 that 
the map L : B -+ e is a proper Fredholm map of index 2n. Similarly, the map 
(6.31) 
(L, p) : B -+ ex T 2n 
defined by u f-7 (L( u), p( u)) is a proper Fredholm map having Fredholm index 
equal to zero. This class of maps possesses a special degree, the Smale degree 

6.2 THE MODEL CASE OF THE TORUS 
211 
mod 2, denoted by 
(6.32) 
for every point (y, m) E [; X T2n. The degree "counts" mod 2 the number of 
preimages under a proper and smooth Fredholm map of index zero and is defined 
as follows. Assume first that x == (y, m) is a regular value of F == (L, p). If u solves 
F(u) = x, the derivative F'(u) is a surjective map, and since its index is zero, it 
is bijective. Thus the map F is locally one-to-one near the solutions u. Since it is 
proper, it follows that there are only finitely many solutions u and the degree is 
defined as the number of these solutions (mod 2) 
(6.33) 
# {u E B I (L,p)(u) = (y,m)} mod 2 . 
If (y, m) is not a regular value, its degree is defined by taking any regular value 
nearby using the Sard-Smale theorem. That this is well-defined can be proved 
the same way as for the Brouwer degree of mappings between manifolds of the 
same dimensions, see J. Milnor [157]. The Smale degree mod 2 enjoys the same 
useful properties as the Brouwer degree. In particular, it is invariant under proper 
homotopies in the class of maps considered. For complete proofs we refer to the 
forthcoming book by H. Brezis and L. Nirenberg [32]. For a survey on Fredholm 
maps and corresponding degrees we refer to [30]. 
Proposition 4. 
deg2 ((L, p), (y, m)) = 1 for all (y, m) . 
Proof. We consider the smooth homotopy of Fredholm operators III : [0,1] x B -+ 
[; X T2n defined by 
(6.34) 
Ills(u) = (u + u+ - u- - s b'(u), p(u)) . 
Since the compactness properties proved above depend only on the C2 norm of 
the Hamiltonian function, we conclude that III is a proper homotopy, so that the 
degree with respect to a point (y, m) is independent of s and hence 
deg2 ((L,p), (y,m)) = 
deg2 (Illo, (y,m)) , 
where Illo(u) = (u + u+ - u-, p(u)). Similarly we can homotope the point (y, m) 
to (0, m) and find that the degree is equal to 
(6.35) 
deg2 (lllo,(O,m)). 
We claim that the number of solutions u of Illo(u) = (0, m) is equal to one. Indeed, 
if u E B solves 
u+u+-u- = 0, p(u) = m 
u(-T) E T2n X E- , u(+T) E T2n X E+, 
then necessarily u(s) = m E T 2n is the unique solution. 

212 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Consequently, deg2 (<po,(O,m)) = 1 provided (O,m) is a regular value of <Po. 
To see this we observe that the linearized map at u( s) = m is the linear operator 
1 
(6.36) 
hl-+ (h+h+-h-, J h(O)(t)dt) 
o 
between the corresponding tangent spaces. It clearly is an isomorphism so that 
(0, m) is indeed a regular value and the proof is finished .• 
So far we know that the set X T = L -1 (0) c B is compact and a smooth 
manifold of dimension 2n, perhaps empty, if ° 
is a regular value. Consider now the 
continuous map p: X T ----7 T 2n , U 1-+ p(u) induced by the map p defined in (6.23). 
Proposition 5. The map p : X T ----7 T 2n induces an injective map in cohomology: 
In particular, the set X T is not empty. 
Proof. Fix an open neighborhood U of X T in B. If y E £ is sufficiently close to 0, 
then L-1(y) c U because L is a proper map. Since, by the Sard-Smale theorem 
for Fredholm maps, the set of regular points is dense we can assume, in addition, 
that y is a regular value of L. The aim is to prove that 
(6.37) 
is injective. Postponing the proof we conclude from the commutativity of the 
diagram 
where j denotes the inclusion map, that (pIU)* is injective as well. This holds for 
every open neighborhood U of the compact set X T . Hence, using the continuity 
property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology 
(6.38) 
fI* (XT ) = dir.lim fI* (U) , 
where this direct limit is taken over all neighborhoods U of X T (see Appendix 
7). We obtain that (pIXT)* is indeed injective as claimed in the proposition. It 
remains to prove the injectivity of (6.37). 

6.2 THE MODEL CASE OF THE TORUS 
213 
Since y is a regular value of L, the map p := pIL-1(y) : L-1(y) -+ T 2n is a 
map between two compact manifolds of dimension 2n. We shall prove that 
(6.39) 
Pick a regular value m E T 2n of p. We claim that (y, m) is a regular value of 
(L, p). Indeed, if (L, p)(u) = (y, m) then L'(u) : f3 -+ f is surjective since y is, 
by assumption a regular value of L. Observe that ker L'(u) = T(L- 1(y)). Since 
by assumption m is regular for p the linear map p' (u) : T( L -1 (y)) -+ T(T2n) is 
a bijection. Consequently the linear map (L' (u), p' (u)) : f3 -+ f X ]R2n between 
the corresponding tangent spaces is a bijection as well, so that (y, m) is regular as 
claimed. By Proposition 4 we therefore have 
1 
# {(L, p)-l (y, m)} mod 2 
# {(pIL-1(y))-1(m)} 
mod 2 . 
Since m is regular, it follows that deg2(p) = 1 as claimed in (6.39). 
Abbreviating the compact 2n-dimensional manifold L -1 (y) by M, we denote 
by OM and OT the £:2 fundamental classes of M and T 2n respectively. In view of 
(6.39) we conclude by the homological definition of the £:2 degree (see Appendix 
7) 
(6.40) 
We point out that on smooth compact manifolds the usual cohomology theo-
ries (like the singular, Alexander-Spanier, Cech) are naturally isomorphic, see F. 
Warner [219]. Hence, we may consider the singular cohomology instead of the 
Alexander-Spanier cohomology. Then by the Poincare duality we have the isomor-
phisms 
Pick a E H i (T2n ), we have to show that p*(a) = 0 implies a = O. For this purpose 
we consider the composition of maps 
Using the naturality property of the cap product (see A. Dold [62]) and using 
(6.40) we compute 
(nOT) -1 P* { (p* a) n OM} = 
(nOT )-1 {a n P*(OM)} = 
(nOT) -1 {a n OT} = a. 

214 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Consequently if p* a = 0 then a = 0 proving that p* is injective. The proof of 
Proposition 5 is completed .• 
We now return to the set Xoo of bounded solutions and show that it is a 
compact set, which can be "approximated" by X T for T large. 
Proposition 6. The space Xoo is a compact (metric) space. 
Proof. If u E Xoo then u(s) -+ Cr(cp) as s -+ ±oo. Since sup{lb(u)l,u E O} < 00 
it follows from the monotonicity of cp(u(s)) that there exists a constant C > 0 
satisfying 
(6.41) 
for all u E Xoo and all s E JR. Consequently the set Xoo is closed. From the 
variation of constants formula (6.14) we conclude, for every T > 0 
(6.42) 
o 
u(O)+ = e-Tu(-T)+ + p+ J eSb'(u(s))ds. 
-T 
Since u( s) -+ Cr( cp) as lsi -+ 00, the set u(JR) is bounded, and hence we conclude, 
as T -+ 00, 
o 
(6.43) 
p+ j* J eSV'b(u(s)) ds. 
-00 
A similar formula holds for u(O)- and hence we find a compact set K C T2n X 
E such that u(O) E K for all u E Xoo. Consequently the set {u(O)lu E Xoo} 
is compact. Since in the COO-topology the solutions u depend continuously on 
their initial conditions, we conclude that Xoo is compact as well and the proof is 
finished .• 
If u EXT, then u is by definition a solution of the gradient equation for 
lsi ~ T, hence it has a unique continuation to a solution u(s) for all times s E JR 
in view of the global Lipschitz continuity of V' cpo This defines an inclusion map 
j : X T -+ Coo(JR, T 2n X JR) by which in the following, we can consider X T as a 
subset of Coo (JR, T2n X E). 
Proposition 7. If U is an open neighborhood of X oo , then 
XTcU 
for T sufficiently large. 

6.2 THE MODEL CASE OF THE TORUS 
215 
Proof. Since b maps n into a bounded set, there exists a constant C > 0 such that 
(6.44) 
Consequently, if U EXT, then 
(6.45) 
for all U EXT, all lsi ::::: T and all T > O. This follows because u(s) is a solution of 
the negative gradient equation (6.13) and hence rp(u(s)) is a monotone-decreasing 
function. We conclude also, that there exists a constant M > 0 such that 
(6.46) 
Ilu( -T)II + Ilu(T)11 ::::: M 
for u E X T and all T > O. In order to finish the proof of the proposition we argue 
indirectly and assume there is a sequence Tn ---; 00 and a sequence Un E XTn 
satisfying Un 
~ U. We shall show that a subsequence of un(O) converges to a 
point x E T 2n X E through which a bounded orbit u E Xoo passes. Indeed, it 
follows from (6.46) together with (6.42), as in the proof of Proposition 6, that 
dist (un(O)+,K+) ---; 0 as n ---; 00, for a compact set K+. Similarly for un(O)-; 
hence taking a subsequence un(O) ---; x E T2n X E. In view of (6.45) we have 
-C::::: rp(un(s)) ::::: c, for lsi::::: Tn for every u where the constant C is independent 
of n. We conclude for the solution u( s) through x = u(O) that -C ::::: rp( u( s)) ::::: C 
for all s E JR, hence u E Xoo. Consequently, Un E U for n large in view of the 
topology of Coo (JR, T 2n X E) and the continuous dependence of the solutions on 
the initial conditions. This contradiction proves the proposition .• 
End of the proof of Theorem 4. In order to prove the injectivity of (pIXoo)* we 
take any open neighborhood U of Xoo. By Proposition 6 we have X T C U. By 
Proposition 5 the map (pIXT)* : H*(T2n) ---; H*(XT) is injective and therefore 
(pIU)* : H*(T2n) ---; H*(U) is injective. This holds true for every open neighbor-
hood of the compact set Xoo and, again, we conclude by the continuity of the 
Alexander-Spanier cohomology that (pIXoo)* : H*(T2n) ---; H*(Xoo) is injective. 
The proof of Theorem 4 is completed .• 
Remarks: It should be pointed out that the torus case permits more elementary 
proofs. The original proof by Conley and Zehnder in [55] is also based on the 
Hamiltonian variational function on the loop space. However, using the linear 
structure of the covering space, the very special symplectic structure Wo and the 
compactness of the torus the problem of finding critical points on the infinite 
dimensional loop space was reduced to the equivalent problem of finding the critical 
points of a related functional on a finite dimensional bundle T2n X JRN of the torus. 
Here the dimension N is large and depends, of course, on the Hamiltonian function 
H considered. The reduction used is the so-called Ljapunov-Schmidt reduction, a 
well-known technique in functional analysis. The question arises whether there is 
an intrinsic finite dimensional approach. Indeed M. Chaperon found in [43] (1984) 

216 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
another variational functional which is directly defined on a finite-dimensional 
vector bundle of the torus by means of a finite sequence of generating functions. 
He also applied his "method of broken geodesics" to the geometric and global 
intersection problem of Lagrangian sub manifolds in T* (Tn). He showed that the 
zero section 0rn, which is diffeomorphic to Tn, can never be separated from itself 
by a Hamiltonian map '(J of T*(Tn). More precisely he proved that 
(::::: SB(Tn) if the intersection is transversal). This was a long-standing open 
question raised by V.I. Arnold in [9]. For modifications and further applications of 
this variational approach we refer to [41]-[44]. In this connection we also mention 
A.B. Givental [105], M. Brunella [36] and Yu. V. Chekanov [47]. The related finite 
dimensional approach due to J.C. Sikorav [197] (1987) is based on the concept of a 
generating phase function for a Lagrangian manifold. The concept appeared earlier 
in the theory of Fourier integral operators and we refer to 1. Hormander [124]. This 
elegant approach turned out to be particularly useful for the special symplectic 
manifolds (T* M, d)"') as demonstrated by the new proof of Hofer's Lagrangian 
intersection theorem in T* M for general compact manifolds M generalizing the 
torus case above, see [197, 136]. The result was previously discovered by H. Hofer 
[114] (1985). It states that 
# {M n '(J(M)} ~ cup-length (M) + 1, 
for every Hamiltonian map '{J of (T* M, d)"'), where we have identified M with the 
zero section Ok. 
In this context of finite dimensional variational arguments we should also men-
tion, that in his work "Symplectic topology as the geometry of generating func-
tions" [218] (1992), C. Viterbo defined symplectic capacities for Lagrangian sub-
manifolds as critical values of the associated phase functions. In this way he defined 
the capacities for open subsets of (ffi.2n , wo) by using Lagrangians which are graphs 
of compactly supported Hamiltonian mappings. In his 1992 lectures Ya. Eliashberg 
outlined how Viterbo's approach could be extended to an alternate construction 
of the Floer-Hofer symplectic homology theory described in Section 6.6, for the 
special case of open subsets of (ffi.2n , wo). The details of his construction were car-
ried out quite recently by L. Traynor in the preprint "Symplectic homology via 
generating functions" [212]. 
It seems that the finite dimensional variational approaches introduced so far 
are not adequate for general symplectic manifolds. For this reason we based our 
proof above for the torus case on the action principle in the loop space. Our proof 
demonstrates that the crucial information of the variational principle is contained 
in the set of bounded solutions of the artificial gradient flow. The set consists of the 
rest points together with the connecting orbits. This observation will be relevant 
in Floer's approach to the Morse theory of functionals whose gradients do not even 
generate a flow. 

6.3 GRADIENT-LIKE FLOWS ON COMPACT SPACES

6.3 
Gradient-like flows on compact spaces 
In the following X is a compact metric space. A flow on X is a continuous map 
rp : lR x X ---* X : (t, x) f--+ rp(t, x) = rpt(x) satisfying 
(6.47) 
for all t, s E lR and x E X. An example is the flow of a differentiable vector field 
on a compact manifold. We shall use the notation 
rpt(x) = X· t 
and abbreviate M . B := {x· tlx E M and t E B} for subsets M c X and B c R 
If x E X, then the map 
t f--+ rpt(x) = X· t 
from lR into X is called the solution through the point x E X. The image of the 
positive (respectively negative) solution through x will be denoted by 1'±(x) = 
x ·lR± and we set l'(x) = x . R Every point x E X belongs, in view of (6.47), to 
precisely one orbit l'(x). The distinguished constant solutions, characterized by 
x·t = x, tElR 
are called rest points or fixed points of the flow, clearly l'(x) = {x} in this case. 
In order to describe the global orbit structure of a flow, it is useful to recall the 
concept of the positive limit set w(x) and the negative limit set w*(x) of the 
solution through x EX. 
Definition. 
w(x) 
w*(x) 
{y E X I :3 tj ---* +00 with X· tj ---* y} 
{y E X I :3 tj ---* -00 with X· tj ---* y} . 
We summarize the well-known properties of these limit sets. Recall that X IS 
compact. 
Proposition 8. If x E X then the limit sets w(x) and w*(x) are not empty, compact, 
connected and invariant under the flow, i.e., w(x)·t = w(x) for all t E R Moreover,

Proof. If tj -+ 00 then the sequence X· tj has a convergent subsequence so that 
w(x) =I- 0. Assume that (6.48) does not hold; then there exists an open neigh-
borhood U ::) w(x) and a sequence tj -+ 00 such that x . tj E X\U. Hence 
for a subsequence X· tj -+ Y E X\U. By definition y E w(x), in contradiction to 
w(x) C U. If w(x) is not connected, then w(x) = WI UW2 for two nonempty compact 
and disjoint subsets Wj eX. Take disjoint open neighborhoods Uj of Wj,j = 1,2; 
then, by (6.48), x . t -+ w(x) and hence for t 2: t*, we have X· t E UI U U2 and 
,+(x . t) n Uj =I- 0 for j = 1,2. Consequently the set ,+(x . t) is not connected 
contradicting the fact that a continuous image of an interval in ~ is connected. 
The invariance of the limit sets is an immediate consequence of the continuity of 
the flow .• 
We assume now, in addition, that the flow is gradient-like, i.e., we require 
that there exists a continuous function V : X -+ ~, which is strictly monotone-
decreasing along every non constant solution: 
t> s =} V(x· t) < V(x· s) . 
Such a function is usually called a Ljapunov function for the flow. A well-known 
special example is the flow generated by a smooth gradient vector field x = 
- \7V (x) on a compact Riemannian manifold. 
Proposition 9. If the flow is gradient-like the limit sets for every solution consists 
of rest points: 
w(x) and w*(x) C {rest points} , 
for every x E X. 
Proof. Since V(x . t) is monotone-decreasing, the limit 
lim V(x· t) = inf{V(x· t) I t 2: O} =: d 
t--->+oo 
exists in R If y E w(x) we conclude by the continuity of V that V(y) = d and 
hence in view of the invariance of w(x) under the flow, V(y· t) = d for every t E R 
By assumption V is strictly decreasing along non constant solutions, hence y must 
be a rest point as claimed .• 
If the gradient-like flow possesses only isolated rest points, then there are only 
finitely many of them, say {Xl, ... , X N } and we conclude from the proposition that 
every nonconstant solution connects two distinct rest points. Every point x E X 
tends under the flow to a distinguished rest point in forward and backward time. 
It is not surprising that the rest points of the flow are intimately related to 
topological properties of X. Indeed, we shall conclude from Proposition 9 the 
following existence statement formulated in Section 6.2 as Theorem 5. 
Theorem 6. (Ljustemik-Schnirelman) For every gradient-like flow on a compact 
metric space we have 
# {rest points} > cup-length (X) + 1.

The theorem will follow immediately from a general qualitative statement for 
Morse decompositions of flows which are not necessarily gradient-like. The state-
ment is taken from [55]. 
Definition. A Morse decomposition of a flow is a finite collection {Mj h EI of 
disjoint, compact and invariant subsets M j 
C X which can be ordered, say 
(MI' M 2 , ... , M k ), such that the following property holds: for every 
X E X\U M j 
jEI 
there exists a pair of indices i < j such that w (x) C Mi and w* (x) C M j . 
Theorem 7. Assume {Mj}jEI is a Morse decomposition of a flow on a compact 
space X. Then 
(6.49) 
CL(X) + 1 ::::; L {CL(Mj) + 1}. 
JEI 
In particular, if III < CL(X)+1 then some compact invariant set Mj has nontrivial 
Alexander-Spanier cohomology and so contains a continuum of points. 
We have abbreviated the cup-length of a space S by CL(S). The flow is not 
required to be gradient-like. Postponing the proof of this theorem, we first prove 
Theorem 6. 
Proof of Theorem 6. Denote by V the Ljapunov function of the gradient-like flow 
and assume it has only finitely many rest points. Then the rest points can be 

220 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
ordered such that V(xd ::; V(X2) ::; ... ::; V(Xk). Since V is strictly decreasing 
along the nonconstant solutions, the rest points {Xl, ... , Xk} constitute, in view of 
Proposition 9, a Morse decomposition of the flow. Since C L( {x j}) = 0 we conclude 
from Theorem 7 
CL(X) + 1::; L 
1 
1<5.j9 
so that the number of rest points must indeed be larger than or equal to C L( X) + 1, 
thus proving Theorem 6 .• 
Proof of Theorem 7. First observe that any Morse decomposition of X can be 
obtained by first decomposing X into two sets, then decomposing one of these and 
continuing until the decomposition is reached. Indeed assume {Ml' M2, ... , Mk} is 
an ordered Morse decomposition of X. Then define the subset Xl = {X E Xlw(x) 
and w*(x) C Ml U M2 U ... U Mk-d. This set is compact and invariant under 
the flow so that {Xl, Md constitutes an ordered Morse decomposition of X into 
two sets. Therefore one only needs to prove the theorem for decompositions into 
two sets. So let {Ml' Md be an ordered Morse decomposition of X. From the 
definition we conclude that there is a compact neighborhood Sl of Ml and a 
compact neighborhood S2 of M2 in X satisfying Sl U S2 = X and, moreover, 
t>O 
t>O 
Consequently, observing that H*(SI . t) = H*(Sd for every t E lR (similarly for 
S2), we conclude by the continuity property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology 
that H*(Sl) = H*(Md and H*(S2) = H*(M2). It is, therefore, sufficient to prove 
that c(Sd + C(S2) ::::: c(X) for Sl U S2 = X, abbreviating c(S) = CL(S) + 1. This 
will follow from the following topological observation: 
Lemma 1. Let Sl U S2 C S be three compact sets. Denote by il : Sl ----> S, i2 : S2 ----> 
Sand i: Sl U S2 ----> S the inclusion maps. Assume 0:,(3 E H*(S). Then ii(o:) = 0 
and i2 ((3) = 0 imply i* (0: U (3) = o. 
Proof of Lemma 1. Consider the following diagram:

The vertical sequences are exact. Hence if 0: E H* (S) satisfies ii (0:) = 0 then there 
is an & E H* (S, Sd with Ji (Oo) = 0:. Similarly, if i2((3) = 0 then j2' (~) = & for some 

6.3 GRADIENT-LIKE FLOWS ON COMPACT SPACES

{3 E H*(S, S2). By the commutativity of the diagram, j*(8: U {3) = jr(8:) UjH{3) = 
a U (3. and by the exactness, i* (a U (3) = i* 0 j* (8: U {3) = 0, as claimed .• 
Returning to the proof of Theorem 7, we assume a1, a2, ... al E H* (X) satisfy 
a1 U a2 U ... U al -1= O. Let the a's be ordered so that a1 U ... U a r is the longest 
product not in the kernel of ii. Then, by definition of the cup-length, C(Sl) 2: r+ 1 
and ii(a1 U·· ·UarUar+d = O. Since X = Sl US2 we conclude from Lemma 1 that 
i2(ar+2 U ... al) -1= 0 and, therefore, C(S2) 2: 1- (r + 1) + 1 = I - r. Consequently 
c(Sd + C(S2) 2: 1+ 1. We have shown that if X admits a nontrivial product with 
I factors, i.e., if c(X) 2: I + 1, then C(Sl) + C(S2) 2: 1+ 1 so that Theorem 7 is 
proved .• 
We defined a gradient-like flow by a Ljapunov function which is strictly mono-
tone decreasing along the nonconstant orbits of the flow. This tradition comes from 
the study of semiflows, defined only for positive time, on noncompact manifolds. In 
our situation of a flow on a compact space, we could have taken a Ljapunov func-
tion instead, which is strictly increasing along nonconstant orbits and we would 
have reached the same conclusions by the same arguments. Actually, we shall make 
use of this remark in the next section, where for different reasons we consider the 
positive instead of the negative gradient equation, which leads to a increasing 
Ljapunov function. This is not relevant since our functional is bounded neither 
from below nor from above. 
Remarks: In this connection we would like to point out another useful inequality 
associated with a Morse decomposition {M1' ... , Md of a flow on X which is not 
assumed to be gradient-like. It relates dynamical invariants of the invariant sets 
M j to topological invariants of the space X and is due to C. Conley. Every set 
M j in a Morse decomposition is an isolated invariant set in the sense that it is the 
maximal invariant set contained in a compact neighborhood. Hence it possesses a 
so-called Conley-index h(Mj) which is the homotopy type of a pointed compact 
space and which is determined by the flow near M j , sec C. Conley [54]. Denoting 
by P(t, h(Mj)) the Poincare polynomial of the pointed compact space one has 
(6.50) 
J 
P being the Poincare polynomial of the space X and Q being a power series 
containing only nonnegative integer coefficients, for a proof we refer to [57]. This 
Conley-Morse equation relates the dynamical invariants of the local invariant sets 
Mj C X to the global topological invariant P(t, X). Consider, for example, the 
special case of a gradient flow defined by x = -V'V(x) on a compact Riemannian 
manifold X. If the critical points x j of the smooth function V on X are not only 
isolated but, in addition, nondegenerate, one can show that 
is the homotopy type of a pointed sphere whose dimension m( x j) is the Morse index 
of the critical point Xj' Consequently P(t,h({xj})) = tm(Xj) is a monomial, see 

222 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
e.g. [56]. Therefore, if all the critical points of V are nondegenerate they constitute 
a Morse-decomposition of X and the equation (6.50) for this special flow is the 
familiar Morse equation 
(6.51) 
2: 
P(t, X) + (1 + t)Q(t) . 
{xlV'V(x)=O} 
It relates the nature of the isolated critical points x of the differentiable function 
V to those topological invariants of X which are described by the Betti numbers. 
C. Conley designed his homotopy index theory in view of its invariance prop-
erties under deformations. These are crucial for applications. He developed his 
theory for continuous flows on locally compact metric spaces. For a concise pre-
sentation of this theory, we refer to D. Salamon [187]. Later on K. Rybakowski in 
a series of papers [184, 185, 186] extended Conley's index theory to a restricted 
class of continuous semiflows in an infinite dimensional setting. It includes flows 
generated by partial differential equations of parabolic type. In this more general 
setting there is also a Morse equation associated with a Morse decomposition of 
an isolated compact invariant subset of the space, as has been demonstrated in 
[186]. 
6.4 Elliptic methods and symplectic fixed points 
We are going to prove the Arnold conjecture for general compact symplectic man-
ifolds (M, w) satisfying [w ]17r2 (M) = O. The proof, based on the action functional 
on the loop space, is inspired by the geometric ideas underlying the proof for the 
standard torus in Section 6.2. But instead of looking at O.D.E. problems, we shall 
now be confronted with first order elliptic systems. 
For the following it is useful to first recall our approach to the torus case. 
The covering map ]R2n --+ T2n and the special symplectic structure permit by 
extending the action functional, originally defined on smooth contractible loops, 
to the Hilbert space Hl/2. The gradient of the extended functional in H 1/2 is 
smooth and can be viewed as a regularization of the L2 gradient of the action. 
The gradient equation on H 1/ 2 determines a unique global flow, which has, in 
addition, the necessary compactness properties. For these reasons we can find all 
the critical point by using O.D.E.-methods as follows. The study of the gradient 
flow on the infinite dimensional space H 1/ 2 of contractible loops can be reduced 
to the study of an (induced) gradient-like flow on a compact metric space X oo , 
an almost classical situation. The set Xoo here is the set of all bounded solutions 
of the gradient flow, consisting of all the critical points of the action functional 
together with their connecting orbits. It is, in general, not a smooth manifold. 
We saw that Xoo contained the topology of the underlying manifold T2n. The 
Ljusternik-Schnirelman theorem, applied to the gradient-like flow on X oo , then 

6.4 ELLIPTIC METHODS AND SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
223 
guaranteed the required number of rest points. In order to get an insight into the 
topology of the set Xoo, we approximated Xoo by a set XT of solutions of a very 
special O.D.E. boundary value problem using the special symplectic structure. 
Applying Fredholm theory to this boundary value problem we approximated XT 
by smooth compact manifolds of dimension 2n whose topology could be estimated. 
By the continuity property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology we finally found 
the desired cohomology of the set Xoo. 
Since the space H 1/ 2 is not contained in Co, the loops in H 1/ 2 have no local 
meaning, and it is not easy to define H 1/ 2 loops on a general manifold. It can be 
done but the space obtained does not carry a natural manifold structure. The main 
idea in the case of a general symplectic manifold (M, w) is to replace the regularized 
gradient (of the torus case) by the unregularized gradient of the action functional 
on the space of smooth contractible loops of M. The associated gradient equation, 
however, does not determine a flow: its Cauchy initial value problem is ill posed, 
as we shall see. But analogous to the torus case, we can still define the set Xoo of 
all bounded solutions u : IR x Sl ---+ M of the unregularized gradient equation; they 
are now solutions of a system of first order elliptic partial differential equations of 
Cauchy-Riemann type, related to the pseudo-holomorphic curves of M. Gromov 
[107J. On this solution set Xoo there is, moreover, a natural lR-action defining a 
gradient-like flow. Hence, following our old strategy, we shall prove that this set 
of solutions is compact and contains the cohomology of the underlying manifold 
M. The Arnold conjecture then follows by applying the Ljusternik-Schnirelman 
theorem as in the torus case. In order to carry out this programme the O.D.E. 
methods of the torus case have to be replaced by P.D.E. methods. In order to 
determine the topology of X 00 we shall approximate the set X 00 by the set of 
solutions X T of a distinguished elliptic boundary value problem, to which we apply 
Fredholm theory based on the Cauchy-Riemann operator on compact surfaces. In 
this way we can approximate X T by smooth compact manifolds of dimension 
2n whose topology can be determined. The easy compactness arguments for the 
torus case, based on O.D.E. methods, will be replaced by an intricate bubbling off 
analysis based on elliptic estimates. 
In order to find the crucial substitute for XT used in Section 6.2 we begin 
with the analysis of the torus case T 2n = 1R2n /7L,2n, this time from the point 
of view of the unregularized gradient. The aim is to reinterpret the approach of 
Section 6.2 from a P.D.E. point of view. We recall that to a periodic function 
H E Coo (Sl X T2n, 1R), we associated the action functional <PH, defined on the 
space of smooth contractible loops x of T2n by 
1 
(6.52) 
<PH (x) = J { 
~(-J±, x) - H(t, x(t)) } dt . 
o 
On the covering space 1R2n the contractible loops x are simply the smooth 
functions x E Coo(sl,1R2n). By extending <PH to a smooth functional 'PH on the 

224 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Hilbert space Hl/2(8 1,]R.2n) we obtained for the H 1/ 2 gradient, which we now 
denote by <p~, the representation 
(6.53) 
Here <I>~(x) is the L2-gradient of <I>H given by 
(6.54) 
V'<I>H(X) = -Jx-V'H(t,x) , 
and j* is the adjoint of the inclusion mapping j : H 1/ 2 -+ L2 defined explicitly in 
Chapter 3. We may view <p~ as the regularization of the L2-gradient <I>~ by means 
of the positive and compact operator j* on L2. Instead of the gradient equation 
tsx = -<p~(x) on H 1/ 2 studied previously, we now study the unregularized equa-
tion tsx = <I>~(x). Observe that we now consider the positive gradient instead of 
the negative one considered in Section 6.2. For indefinite functionals this is irrele-
vant. However, this way we are led, as we shall see, in a natural way to the familiar 
Cauchy-Riemann operator instead of the anti-Cauchy-Riemann operator. Setting 
u(t, s) = x(s)(t) for the loops at time s, we obtain the partial differential equation 
(6.55) 
au 
au 
as = -J at -V'H(t,u) , 
for a smooth function u E Coo (]R. x 81, ]R.2n). Abbreviating the notation in the 
following, we write u' = -Ju - H'(t, u) instead of (6.55), where H' = V' H stands 
for the gradient of the function H in the x variable. The operator 
I 
au 
au 
u + Ju = -

(6.56) 
is nothing but the well-known Cauchy-Riemann operator for maps u : ]R.2 -+ 
]R.2n. To see this it is convenient to identify ]R.2n with en as follows. We split 
]R.2n = ]R.2 EEl· .. EEl]R.2 into symplectic subspaces]R.2, having the symplectic structure 
wo(a, b) = (Ja, b) with the matrix J given by 
(6.57) 
J = (_~ ~). 
We identify ]R.2 with e by means of the linear isomorphism U : e -+ ]R.2 given by 
z = (y + ix) f---+ (x,y) = (1m z,Rez). On e, the complex structure is now the 
multiplication by i = A, since 
(6.58) 
U-1JU = i, 
and Wo becomes wo(z,~) = -lm(zJ,). Setting z = s+it E e we shall view the map 
u : ]R.2 -+ ]R.2n as a map u : z f---+ u(z) E en so that the operator (6.56) becomes 
the familiar Cauchy-Riemann operator on every copy of e, 
(6.59) 
::+i~~=aU. 

6.4 ELLIPTIC METHODS AND SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
Similarly the operator ~~ -
J~~ is, in our complex notation, the operator 
(6.60) 
au 
au 
--i- = au. 
as

225 
Note that for convenience we drop the factor ~ in the usual definition of the 
Cauchy-Riemann operator. 
The Cauchy-Riemann operator is a first order elliptic partial differential oper-
ator and \7 H is a lower order perturbation. There is no well-defined initial value 
problem associated with the elliptic equation (6.55). Indeed, assume H = O. Then 
every solution u of (6.55) solves 8u(z) = 0 and hence is holomorphic so that the 
initial data u(O, t) = x(t) at s = 0 has to be at least a real analytic loop. But even 
working in the space of real analytic loops does not help since there are analytic 
loops which are not restrictions of globally defined holomorphic maps. 
Assume now that u E Coo (lR X 8 1 , T2n) solves the partial differential equation 
(6.55), and define the map S f-+ u(s) from lR ----; COO(8\ T2n) by setting u(s)(t) := 
u(s, t). From (6.52) we compute readily 
(6.61) 
:s <PH (u(s)) = 11- Ju(s) - H' (t, u(s)) 1112 . 
Hence the map s ----; <PH (u( s)) is nondecreasing. The following nontrivial fact will 
become crucial. 
Lemma 2. Assume u E COO(lR x 8\ T2n) is a solution of (6.55). If for some So E lR 
then u(s) = u(so) for all s E lR hence is independent of s. Moreover x E COO(81 , M) 
defined by x(t) := u(so)(t) is a I-periodic solution of the Hamiltonian system 
associated to H. 
Proof. Considering our geometric approach, this statement seems obvious, yet the 
proof is not easy. It is based on Carleman's similarity principle proved in Appendix 
5. Without loss of generality we may assume that So = 0 so that 
-Ju(O) - H' (t, u(O)) = 0, 
for all t E 8 1 . 
This means that x(t) := u(O)(t) defines a I-periodic solution of the Hamiltonian 
vector field x = XH(X). We denote by 7/Jt the I-parameter family of symplectic 
diffeomorphisms solving -!it7/Jt = X H ( 7/Jt) and 7/Jo = I d. Extending the map u 
periodically in t we shall view it as a map u : lR x lR ----; M. Now we define a new 
map v : lR x lR ----; M by 
u(s,t) 
7/Jt (v(s, t)), 
for all (s, t) E lR2 ,

Hence, introducing the almost complex structure 
the map v : ]R2 ----; M solves

for t E ]R . 
Let v(O,O) = m E M. We take a chart around m, say r.p : U ----; r.p(U) C ]R2n

Moreover, w(O, t) = ° for t close to t = 0. To sum up, introducing the almost 
complex structure J(s, t) := Tr.p(v(s, t))J(s, t)Tr.p(v(s, t))-l, the map w : ]R2 ----;

A 
8w 
8s + J(s, t)8t = 0, w(O, t) = ° for t close to 0. 
In particular, the point (0,0) E ]R2 is a cluster point of zeroes w(s, t) = ° 
of the 
solution w. In this situation we can apply the generalized Carleman similarity 
principle proved in Appendix 5. It states that w is of the form w(z) = <I>(z)O'(z) 
for all z = s + it in a neighborhood U of z = ° E e, where <I> : U ----; QllR(en ) 
is continuous and 0' : U ----; en is holomorphic. We conclude that w = ° 
in a full 
neighborhood of ° 
E ]R2. This implies that v is constant in a neighborhood of zero 
and, therefore, 
u(s, t) = x(t) for sand t close to 0. 
Consider now the following set of points: 
E = {(s, t) E ]R x]R1 u(s, t) = x(t) 
and there exists a sequence (Sk' tk) ----; (s, t), 
(Sk' tk) -=I- (s, t) satisfying U(Sk' tk) = X(tk)}'

This set is closed, and by the previous discussion nonempty. If (so, to) E ~ we can 
apply the previous argument and deduce that (so, to) is an interior point of ~. 
Consequently ~ = ffi. x ffi., and hence u(s, t) = x(t) for all (s, t) E ffi. X Sl. This 
implies that u(s) = u(O) for all s E ffi., hence u(s) is a rest point representing the 
periodic orbit x(t) = u(O)(t). The proof of Lemma 2 is complete .• 
The space Xoo of "bounded solutions" of the (unregularized) gradient equation 
is defined by 
(6.62) 
Xoo 
{u E Coo(ffi. x s1, T2n) I u satisfies (6.63) below} . 
Here 
Us + JUt + H'(t,u) = 0 
(6.63) 
-00 < i~f <I> H ( u( s)) :s: s~p <I> H ( u( s)) < +00 . 
We equip the space X 00 with the topology induced from Coo (ffi. x S\ T2n). There 
is a continuous ffi.-action on Xoo defined by 
(6.64) 
(7, u) 
f---+ 
u· 7 
where (u· 7)(S, t) = u(s + 7, t). The gradient is independent of time; hence with 
u(s, t) also U(S+7, t) is a solutions of (6.63). The flow (6.64) on Xoo is gradient-like. 
Indeed, define the continuous function V by 
V : Xoo -----+ffi., Uf---+<I>H(U(O)). 
Then it follows from Lemma 2 that V is a Ljapunov function, i.e., 7 f---+ V(u· 7) 
strictly increases with 7, along nonconstant orbits. In addition, the constant orbits 
of the flow are the I-periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian equation x = XH(X). 
Hence the rest points are the same as the ones for the set Xoo previously introduced 
in Section 6.3. But the new set Xoo differs from the old one. If the set Xoo is 
compact and if its cohomology is sufficiently rich, we can conclude from Theorem 
1 a certain number of rest points of the flow. Before we turn to the compactness 
proof of Xoo which is closely related to elliptic regularity theory, we first address 
the question how we can replace T 2n by a general compact symplectic manifold 
(M,w). 
We choose an almost complex structure J compatible with w, in the sense that

CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Here H' is the gradient associated to gJ with respect to the x-variable. Again 
we assume that for fixed s, the loop u(s)(·) in e oo(81,M) is contractible. Hence 
s -+ u(s) defines a map from JR. into ego(8I, M), where ego denotes the set of 
contractible loops on M. Here the first difficulty arises. What should the functional 
<PH be? There is only one way to produce such a <PH: if x is a contractible loop in 
M. We pick an extension x : D -+ M, where D is the closed unit disc bounded by 
8 1 = aD such that xlaD = x. We now define the action by 
1 
(6.67) 
<PH(X) = J x*w - J H(t,x(t))dt. 
D 
0 
Unfortunately, this is in general not well-defined. Namely, if we take another 
extension i; of x the numbers fD x*w and fD i;*w need not be the same. In fact 
they may differ by a number r Ere JR., where r, the so-called period group, is 
the image of the group homomorphism 
a : 7I"2(M) -+ JR. : [u] -+ J u*w, where u : 8 2 -+ M. 
8 2 
We note that the map a is well-defined by Stokes's theorem; moreover, r = im 
(a) is a subgroup of (JR., +). Summing up we only have a functional 
<PH : e~ (8\ M) -+ JR./r . 
Since for M = T 2n we have 71"2 = 0, we conclude that r = {O} implying JR./r = R 
In contrast to this special example, the subgroup r can be dense as the following 
example shows. Take M = 8 2 X 8 2 with the symplectic form n EEl rn where n is 
a volume form of total v?lume 1 on 8 2 and where r > 0 is an irrational number. 
Then r = {a + br I a, b E IE } , which is dense in JR.. We point out that 
the condition r = {O}, which for example is satisfied if 7I"2(M) = 0, is a very 
restrictive condition. Indeed, since M is compact we know that the cohomology 
class of the symplectic structure w, say [w], is nontrivial in H2(M, JR.). If 7I"1(M) = 0 
the Hurewicz-homomorphism 
is an isomorphism. Therefore the homomorphism a is nontrivial, implying that 
r =I- {O}. We see that r = {O} implies 7I"1(M) =I- {O}. We want to point out 
that the case r =I- {O} can also be treated at least partially. In fact, in order to 
do Morse theory, one only needs a hypothesis on the first Chern class of T M, 
which is vacuous in dimensions 2,4 and 6. Under this condition no hypothesis on 
the symplectic form is needed. So, in particular, the Arnold conjectures for the 
Morse theory hold in dimensions 2,4 and 6. We refer the reader to H. Hofer and 
D. Salamon [119] and K. Ono [172]. 

6.4 ELLIPTIC METHODS AND SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
In the following we shall assume r = {O} hence requiring that 
(6.68) 
J 
u* w = 0 for u: S2 ----> M .

229 
Now we have a well-defined functional cI>H : C'g"'(Sl, M) ----> lR defined on the 
contractible loops by (6.67). In order to prove the Arnold conjecture we need to 
show the compactness of Xoo and to compute its cohomology. The compactness will 
be studied by using elliptic regularity theory. The cohomology will be computed 
by using an approximation argument, replacing the sets X T previously used in 
Section 6.2 by suitable substitutes. 
The first aim is to replace the O.D.E. boundary value problem X T in Section 
6.2 by a boundary value problem for an elliptic P.D.E. To find the appropriate 
modification for the general symplectic manifold, we go back to the torus case 
and consider x E T 2n X E+. Identifying lR2n with en, a loop x E T2n X E+ is 
represented as 
(6.69) 
x(t) 
00 
ao + L ak e27rikt , 
k=l 
with ao E T2n and ak E en. We shall view Sl as the boundary aD of the closed 
disc D = {z E e : Izi ::; I} and extend the map x : Sl = aD ----> en to a map 
u : D ----> e by defining 
(6.70) 
u(z) 
00 
ao + L ak zk, 
zED. 
k=l 
Clearly u(e27rit ) = x(t) and since this loop belongs to H1/2(Sl), the series 
converges on every disc Izi ::; p < 1 uniformly and hence defines a holomorphic 
map from the open disc b = {z E e: Izi < I} into T2n. Setting z = s + it we 
have Us + iUt = 0 on b. We claim that 
(6.71) 
provided ao = O. We conclude that an element x E T2n X E+ can be considered as 
the boundary x = ulaD of a holomorphic disc u : D ----> T 2n of finite area, which 
is positive if x -=f=. 0

anti-holomorphic disc. It is represented by

and the extension v : D ---+ <en is defined by

v(z) = bo + L bkzk , zED,

so that v(e27rit) = x(t). The map v is anti-holomorphic i.e., it satisfies Vs - iVt = 0

together with the matching boundary conditions (6.74). We shall rewrite the sys-
tem (6.75) together with the boundary conditions as a single equation. We de-
fine the Riemannian sphere 8T by adding two caps at the ends of the cylinder 
ZT = [-T, TJ x 8 1 such that

We observe that the transition maps 'PI o'IjJ-1 and 'P2 o'IjJ-1 are holomorphic. These 
charts define a complex structure jon 8T . By the Uniformization Theorem (8T ,j)

CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
is bi-holomorphic to (S2, i), where S2 = C u {oo} is the standard Riemannian 
sphere, see, e.g., O. Forster [92]. For notational convenience we denote the a-disc 
by Dl and the ,B-disc by D2. Consider now v E COO(ST, T2n) and define a map 
Lv, which is smooth on ih, D2 and (-T, T) x SI as 
(6.78) Lv = Tv + J 0 (Tv) 0 j + X[-T,Tlxs1 (H'(v)ds - JH'(v)dt) . 
Here (s, t) are the coordinates on [-T, T] x SI and X[-T,TjxS1 is the corresponding 
characteristic function on ST. Moreover Tv is the tangent map of v : ST -+ T2n. 
Observe that (Lv)(z) is a linear map TzST -+ Tv(z)T2n, which satisfies the relation 
-J 0 (Lv)(z) = (Lv)(z) oj. 
We denote by AT2n -+ ST X T 2n the vector bundle whose fibre over (z, m) consists 
of all complex anti-linear maps "( : TzST -+ Tm T 2n, satisfying "(j = -J"(. If v 
is a map ST -+ T2n, we denote by v* AT2n the pullback of AT2n by the graph 
z -+ (z, v(z)) of v. Then Lv may be viewed as a section of v* AT2n -+ ST. Assume 
v is continuous and smooth on ST\{(±T, t)lt E SI} and moreover satisfies Lv = 0 
away from the circle {±T} x SI. That precisely means that Lv is the zero section 
of v* AT2n -+ ST. Consider the vector field gs on (-T, T) X SI. Then 
o 
(Lv)(s, t)(gs) 
Vs + JVt + H'(t, v) . 
We see that v satisfies differential equation (6.75) on (-T, T) X SI. On Dl and 
D2 we have Vs + JVt = 0 and Vs - JVt = 0 respectively. Moreover, the boundary 
conditions are satisfied on the common parts of D 1 , D2 and [-T, T] X SI. 
This new construction can easily be generalized to arbitrary compact symplec-
tic manifolds. For this let us denote by j the complex structure on ST and by J 
an almost complex structure compatible with w on M. For v : ST -+ M we define 
the section Lv of v* AM by 
(Lv)(z) = Tv(z) + J(v) 0 Tv(z) 0 j 
(6.79) 
+X[-T,Tl xS1 (z) [H' (t, v(z) )ds - J( v(z) )H' (t, v(z) )dt] 
In order to study the equation Lv = 0, we need to develop a suitable functional 
analytic set up. If 2 < p < 00 we consider the Banach manifold W 1,P(ST, M) 
consisting of maps from ST into M belonging to the Sobolev class W 1,p. For the 
construction of a natural differentiable structure on W 1,P(ST, M) we refer the 
reader to the article by H. Eliasson [79]. For v E W 1,P(ST, M) we consider the 
bundle v* AM -+ ST and let LP(v* AM) be the associated space of LP-sections. 
Then, we can equip 

6.4 ELLIPTIC METHODS AND SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
233 
with the structure of a Banach space bundle over the Banach manifold 
Wl,P(ST, M). Summing up we have formulated the elliptic system (6.75) to-
gether with the matching boundary conditions (6.74) in such a way that solu-
tions are to be found as the zeroes of the section L of the Banach space bundle 
LP(Wl,P(ST, M)* AM) ---+ Wl,P(ST, M). We shall denote the set of solutions by 
X T = {v E Wl,P(ST,M)IL(v) = a}. 
Note that we cannot expect a solution v : ST ---+ M of L( v) = 0 to be of 
regularity better than Wl,p near the boundary fJZT of the cylinder ZT. This is 
due to the non-smoothness of the cut-off function s f---+ X[ -T,T] (s) at the boundary 
components s = ±T of ZT. Recall that these two boundary components agree 
with the boundaries of the two disks D glued to the cylinder. However, it follows 
from the results in Appendix 5, that a solution v of L( v) = 0 is smooth except at 
fJZT where the derivatives in s (i.e., normal to the boundaries) do not match. To 
be more precise we have Wl,P(ST, M) C OO(ST, M) by the Sobolev embedding 
theorem, since p > 2. Hence v being continuous can be studied in local coordinates. 
If z is a point in the interior of the cylinder ZT we have, in local coordinates, 
v E W l ,P(Be,]R2n) with a small open ball Be centered at z. Moreover v is a weak 
solution of a special system of first order elliptic equations and we conclude that 
v E 0 00 (Be, ]R2n) by the "inner" regularity theory of elliptic partial differential 
equations. Similarly, the solution v of L( v) is smooth in the interior of the disks 
D. It is proved in Appendix 5 that, in addition, v has smooth extensions from the 
interior of ZT to its boundary fJZT and also from the interior of the disks to their 
boundaries fJD l U fJD2 = fJZT. This does, of course, not mean that the solutions 
fit smoothly at the boundary, since the derivatives (in s) normal to the boundary 
do not agree. But the restriction of v to the boundary fJZT is smooth, so that, in 
particular, v( -T) and v(T) are smooth loops belonging to O;;o(S1, M). 
We can now use the variational structure of our problem to derive a natural 
a priori estimate for solutions v EXT. Recall the assumption WI7r2(M) = 0 and 
assume that L( v) = O. Let 0 > 0 be a constant bounding I max H( t, x) I and 
(t,x)

6.4 ELLIPTIC METHODS AND SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
235 
We note that for the estimates it is convenient in the following to view M as a 
compact submanifold of some JRN via Whitney's embedding theorem, see, e.g., M. 
Hirsch [113]. Since G=(JR x s1, JRN) is a Frechet space with the usual translation 
invariant metric d we may view G= (JR x S1, M) as a closed subspace of G= (JR x 
S1, JRN). The induced metric we denote also by d. We shall see that X= is a 
compact subspace of G=(JR x S1, JRN). We begin with 
Proposition 10. There exists a constant G > 0 such that for every U E X= we have 
<PH(U(S)) E [-G,G] , 
sEJR. 
Proof. By assumption <PH(U(JR)) is bounded in lR. Hence, abbreviating 1111

J 11<p'y (u(s)) 112 ds J (! <PH (U(S)) ) ds < +00.

Consequently there exists a sequence (Sn) C JR, with Sn ----t +00, such that 
<PH (U(Sn)) ---+ a E JR and 11<p'y (U(Sn)) II ---+ 0 . 
Defining Xn = u(sn) E G=(S1, M) we obtain 
(6.81) 
Considering Xn as a map into JRN we deduce by the compactness of M that 
IlxnIIL2(Sl,~N):::; 
const, where we used the usual £2-inner product. Hence we 
find a subsequence satisfying 
Xn ~x 
(6.82) 
Xn ----tx 
weakly in H 1,2(S1,JRN) 
strongly in GO(SI,JRN ) . 
The latter convergence follows using the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. From (6.81) and 
(6.82) we conclude that xn is a Cauchy-sequence in £2 so that 
(6.83) 
Xn ----t x in H 1,2(Sl, M) and x = XH(X) . 
Consequently x E G=(S1, M) and x is a I-periodic solution of the Hamiltonian 
vector field. Now <PH(Xn) ----t <PH(X) and hence a = <PH(X). We can argue similarly 
for sequences Xn = u(sn) where Sn ----t -00. By the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem the set 
of alII-periodic solutions x = XH(x) is compact in G=(S1,JRN), so that the set 
of critical levels 
is compact in lR. We choose G > 0 so large that the interval [-G, G] contains C. 
Since S ~ <PH ( U( s)) is monotone and since, as we have seen, the bounded solution 
U connects critical points we conclude that -G :::; <PH(U(S)) :::; G for all S E JR 
completing the proof of the proposition .• 

236 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Corollary 1. Xoo is closed in GOO(lR x 81, M). 
Proof. Pick any sequence (un) C Xoo' We know from Proposition 10 that 
<J>H(Un(lR)) C [-G,G]. Assume Un ---+ U for the Goo-metric d. We obtain for every 
r>O 
Hence, as n ---+ 00 the estimate implies that <J>H(U(lR)) C lR is bounded. Moreover, 
since 8;;sn + J( un) f91t + H' (t, un) = 0, we may pass to the limit and see that 
U satisfies the differential equation as well. This shows that indeed U E Xoo as 
claimed .• 
The geometric picture is as in Section 6.2: a "bounded orbit" U E Xoo connects 
I-periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian equation j; = XH(X) on M. We next 
prove that Xoo is a compact subset of GOO(lR x 81, M). Note that the metric 
space Goo (lR x 8 1 , M) has the Heine-Borel property; this is a consequence of the 
Arzela-Ascoli Theorem applied to all the derivatives of the functions. Since, by 
the Corollary, Xoo is a closed set we have to show that Xoo C GOO(lR X 8 1 , M) 
is bounded. This requires that for every compact K C lR X 8 1 and every integer 
n E N there is a constant GK,n > 0, such that 
sup 
ID"'u(s, t)1 ::; GK,n for all U E Xoo . 
(6.84) 
(s,t) E K 
lal ::; n 
The important ingredient for the proof of (6.84) is a gradient estimate uniform in 
U E Xoo. Here we shall use the assumption WI1f2(M) = 0 in a crucial way. Note 
that in order to work in local coordinates we have to make sure that, for a whole 
sequence of mappings, a fixed local neighborhood of a point is mapped into the 
same chart of the image space. 
Theorem 8. Suppose WI1f2(M) = O. Then there exists a constant A > 0 such that 
lV'u(s, t)IJ < A 
for all U E Xoo and (s, t) E lR X 8 1 . 
Proof. Arguing indirectly we find sequences (Sk' tk) E lR x 8 1 and (Uk) C Xoo such 
that 
IV'Uk(Sk, tk)IJ -----t +00 . 
Since Xoo is invariant under the lR-action (6.64) we may assume that Sk = 0 
replacing Uk by Uk . Sk. Moreover, taking a subsequence we may assume tk ---+ to. 
Pick any sequence (10k) satisfying 
(6.85) 
We wish this sequence to meet additional conditions and use a little trick. It is 
based on the following: 

6.4 ELLIPTIC METHODS AND SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
237 
Lemma 5. Let (X, d) be a complete metric space and 9 : X -+ [0, +00) a continuous 
map. Assume Xo E X and EO > 0 are given. Then there exists x E X and E > 0 
such that 
0< E S EO 
g(X)E 2: g(XO)EO 
d(x, XO) S 2Eo 
g(y) S 2g(x) for all y satisfying d(y, x) S E . 
Proof of Lemma 5. Assume there is no Xl E X satisfying d(XI' xo) S EO and 
g(xd > 2g(xo). Then the ~1 ,dement follows taking x = Xo and E = Eo. Otherwise 
we can pick such an Xl and, proceeding inductively, we can assume there are 
Xo, Xl, ... ,Xn satisfying 
for all 1 S k S n. Then if there does not exist an XnH with 
(6.86) 
the statement follows choosing X = Xn and E = ~~. Indeed Xn satisfies d(xn' xo) S 
d(xn, xn-d + ... + d(XI' xo) S 2Eo, and g(xn) > 2g(Xn-l) > 22g(xn_2) > 2ng(xo) 
and hence g(Xn)E > g(XO)EO. Moreover, from (6.86) we conclude that if d(y,xn) S 
c, then g(Yn) S 2g(xn), hence proving the claim. If, on the other hand, there 
exists an Xn+l satisfying (6.86) we continue the process. It must terminate after 
finitely many steps since otherwise we have a Cauchy sequence (xn) C X satisfying 
g(xn) -+ +00. This is not possible, since Xn -+x* and 9 is continuous at X* .• 
In order to simplify the notation we shall write in the following I . I instead of 
the Riemannian norm I . I J on the tangent space. In view of the above lemma we 
can replace Xk = (Sk' tk) and Ek by slightly modified sequences and may assume, 
again using the JR.-action, that the above sequence Uk satisfies, in addition 
Here we conveniently view the maps U as maps defined on JR. X JR. by a I-periodic 
continuation in the t-variable. Rescaling we define a new sequence Vk E Coo (JR.2 , M) 
by 
(6.88) Vk(S,t) = Uk((O,tk) + ~k (s,t)) , 
where Rk

are uniformly bounded, we shall conclude later on by the elliptic estimates for the 
equations (6.90) the following crucial: 
Lemma 6. Assume the sequence Vk satisfies (6.89) and (6.90). Then there exists 
v E Coo (]R2 ,M) and a subsequence such that 
Vk --t v in Coo (]R2, M) . 
Postponing the proof of this lemma, we show next how Theorem 8 follows from 
our topological assumption that [wll7l"2(M) = O. We observe that the smooth map 
v guaranteed by the lemma is a holomorphic map of finite and positive area, hence 
not a constant map. Indeed from (6.89), (6.90) and (6.91) we deduce the following

The restriction to the boundary of the holomorphic disc v I DR: D R ~ M defines 
the contractible loop XR : 8 1 ~ M by XR(T) = v(Re27riT). In view of the differen-
tial equation in (6.92) this loop satisfies IXR(T)I = 27fRI~~(Re27riT)I. Computing 
in polar coordinates we find that 
which is finite in view of (6.92). Consequently, there is a sequence of holomorphic 
discs vlDRj such that the arc lengths l(xRj) of their boundaries tend to zero as 
j ~ 00. In order to estimate the area of these discs by the arc length, we cover 
the compact manifold M by finitely many open sets Uj eM, 1 ~ j ~ N such 
that each OJ is diffeomorphic to a closed ball. There is a constant d > 0 such that 
every loop x on M having diameter ~ d is contained in one of the sets Uj • By 
Poincare's lemma we conclude that wlOj = dAj for a I-form Aj on OJ. Therefore 
we can estimate the action of a loop x(t) C Uj for t E [0,1] by the arc length l(x),

Consider now the small loop x R (T) which is the boundary of the holomorphic disc 
v R. Then it is contained in one of the open sets, say Uj . Since it is contractible we

can choose a different disc w : DR ---> M also satisfying wlaD = XR but which, in 
addition, is contained in Uj so that W(DR) C Uj . If, for example a: Uj ---> B 1(0) C

However, there is a sequence of holomorphic discs with l (x Rj) ---> 0 as we have 
seen above, and hence we arrive at a contradiction to the monotonicity (6.93) of 
if?(R). This contradiction shows that our assumption, namely that the gradients 
of u E Xoo are not uniformly bounded, is false. Hence Theorem 8 is true. 
The above techniques are usually referred to as bubbling off analysis. In order 
to complete the proof of Theorem 8, it remains to prove Lemma 6. 
Proof of Lemma 6. In order to simplify the procedure we first get rid of the Hamil-
tonian term in (6.90), which tends to zero as Rk ---> 00. Using a trick due to M. Gro-
mov [107] we put it = (8, t, m) E ]R2 X M and define Jk : T(]R2 x M) ---> T(]R2 X M)

by

where HUt, m) = ~k H'(tk + i k , m). One verifies readily that J~ = -id. Hence Jk 
is a sequence of almost complex structures on ]R2 x M converging together with 
all its derivatives uniformly on ]R2 x M to the almost complex structure i EB J, if 
we identify ]R2 with C in the usual way. Define the sequence Vk E Coo (]R2 ,]R2 X M) 
by 
(6.98) 
Vk(S, t) = (S,t,Vk(S,t)) .

The aim is to find a subsequence such that Vk --'> v in Coo (]R2 ,]R2 X M) for a map 
v E Coo(]R2,]R2 X M). In view of the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem it is sufficient to find 
Cz'~)c-bounds for Vk, i.e., for every compact set K we have to find uniform (in k) 
bounds for Vk together with all the derivatives. Choosing p > 2 it is sufficient, in 
view of Sobolev's embedding theorem to establish on every compact subset K c ]R2 
uniform bounds in W1,P(K) instead of C1(K) for all I :2: l. In order to establish 
such wi;~ -bounds, we proceed by induction. By assumption the gradients of Vk are 
uniformly bounded so that the Wl;~ -bounds are guaranteed. Arguing indirectly 
we shall assume now that there are wi;~ -bounds but not Wi~l,P -bounds, for some 
I :2: l. Hence possibly taking a subsequence of Vk, we find a sequence Xk E ]R2 and 
a sequence Ck > 0 satisfying Ck --'> 0 such that

where, viewing M as a subset of ]RN, we consider Vk as a map from ]R2 into ]RN. 
Since, by assumption, IVVkl is uniformly bounded we conclude, by the Arzela-
Ascoli theorem, for a subsequence, that

This allows us to localize the problem in a coordinate chart. Around (xo, m) E 
]R2 X M there is a chart given by a : U --'> ]R2+2n, satisfying a( Xo, m) = 0 and

sufficiently large. Hence defining the smooth functions Uk := a 0 Vk : BEo (x, 0) ---+

Jo := 700(0), 
J6 = -n. 
Now we make use of the following well-known elliptic estimate for the Cauchy-
Riemann operator. For every 1 < p < 00, m and n :::: 0 there exists a constant 
G > 0 such that 
(6.105) 
for every smooth function U : jR2 ---+ jR2n+2 having compact support in the unit 
ball. This is the classical estimate for the Cauchy-Riemann operator (if written in 
complex notation), Jo being constant. For a proof we refer to the monograph by 
E. Stein [205], p. 60. In order to apply this estimate, we take a smooth function 
(3: jR ---+ [0,1] such that (3(s) = 1 for lsi :::; ~ and (3(s) = 0 for lsi:::: 1. For>. > 0 we 
define the function a A (x) := (3( x>.,xo ). Then a A (x) = 0 if Ix - Xo I :::: >.. To simplify 
the formulas we shall use the abbreviating notation 
lull: = lulwl,p(Bco(xo)) ' 
where p > 2 is fixed. Moreover, we shall abbreviate a == aA' We then conclude 
from (6.105) that 
G laukll+l :::; I(auk)s + Jo(auk)tll . 
By the Cauchy-Riemann equation, (Uk)s = -Jk(Uk)(Uk)t, and 
Using now the Leibniz rule for differentiation and the inductive assumption, name-
ly that IUkl1 :::; Gl, we conclude 
G laukll+l :::; IJo - Jk(uk)ILoo(B>.(xo)) ·Iaukll+l + G3(>') .

Since Uk(XO) -7 0, Uk -7 Uoo uniformly on Bco(xo) and Jo = limJk(O), we see, 
that the factor in front of laUkll+1 on the right hand side is smaller than ~, if A 
is sufficiently small, and if k is sufficiently large. Since a == 1 on Bck(Xk) as soon 
as k is sufficiently large, we finally conclude 
IUklwl+l,P(Bgk(Xk)) ::; C4 < 00, 
if k is sufficiently large. This obviously contradicts the last statement in (6.104) 
and hence the proof of Lemma 6 is finished .• 
With Lemma 6, the proof of Theorem 8 is completed: we have uniform gradient 
estimates for U E X 00' Therefore, we can apply the same arguments as in Lemma 
6 and obtain Cz'~c-bounds, uniform for U E Xoo' In addition, using the lR-action 
(6.95) on Xoo we can get much more, namely Cb bounds on lR x 8 1 , with the norms 
defined by Iulc~ = sup IDO!u(s, t)l, where the supremum is taken over lal ::; land 
(s, t) E lR X 8 1. We shall show that 
for every l ~ 0, so that Xoo is uniformly bounded in COO(lR x 81, M)j here we 
view M again as a subset of lRN. The easiest way to see this is the following. 
Since the uniform gradient estimate for Xoo holds on all of lR x 8 1 , we can take 
the lR-action on X oo, given by T' u(s, t) = u(s + T, t) and only have to prove the 
uniform Cl estimates for Xoo on a finite covering of the interval s* x [0,1] C lR X 8 1 
by compact sets for some fixed s* E R But this we have just done in the proof of 
the previous lemma and the claim is proved. Since Xoo is closed and bounded in 
Coo (lR x 8 1, M) we have demonstrated 
Proposition 11. The set Xoo of bounded orbits is a compact subset of the metric 
space COO(lR x 81, M). 
On Xoo there is as we have seen a continuous flow which is gradient-like and 
we can estimate the number of rest points by Ljusternik-Schnirelman (Theorem 
6), provided of course that Xoo f=. 0. In order to get an insight into the topology 
of this set Xoo of bounded orbits we shall proceed as in Section 6.2 and first prove 
that the sets X T are close to Xoo if T is large. Recall that the space XT is defined 
as the set of solutions 
(6.106) 
X T : = {u E W 1,P(8T,M) ILu = O}, 
where the nonlinear operator L is defined in (6.79). Recall also that we cannot 
expect better regularity properties for these solutions, since L contains the non-
smooth term X[-T,Tlxs1H1. Since p > 2 we have W 1,P(8T,M) c CO(8T,M) in 
view of the Sobolev embedding theorem. However, we shall restrict now the solu-
tions u to the cylinder ZT C 8T . By elliptic regularity theory, these restrictions are 
smooth as we have pointed out above: ulzT E Coo (ZT' M). Moreover, by Lemma 

244 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
4, there exists a constant C > 0 such that for every solutions v EXT, the following 
estimate (on ZT) holds 
(6.107) 
where C is independent of T > O. Copying now the above COO-estimates word for 
word we find, for every given multi-index a, a constant Ca > 0 such that for every 
T> 2 and for every v EXT, the following estimate holds: 
(6.108) max {IDav(s, t)1 I (s, t) E [-T + 2, T - 2] x [0, I]} ::; Ca. 
From this we shall conclude that X T is close to Xoo provided T is large enough. 
To make this statement more precise we take a smooth function {J : lR ----t [0, 1] 
satisfying (J(s) = 1 for s ::; 1, (J'(s) > 0 for 1 < s < 2 and (J(s) = 0 for s ::::: 2 and 
define the family of cut off functions {JT : lR ----t [0, 1] for T ::::: 5 by

By (6.108), we have uniform Coo-estimates on [-T + 1, T - 1] x [0,1]. Assume we 
are given an open neighbourhood U of Xoo in COO(lR X 3 1, M). This means that 
there exists R > 0, E > 0 and kEN such that every w E Coo (lR X 3 1 , M) for which 
there exists an u E X 00 satisfying 
I Da(u(s, t) - w(s, t)) I < E, for all (s, t) E [-R, R] x 3 1 , and for allial ::; k, 
belongs to U. We conclude that for T large 
Indeed, arguing indirectly we find a sequence Tn ----t 00 and a sequence Un E XTn 
such that Vn := aTJun) tf- U. However, in view of (6.108) we find that (vn) has 
a subsequence converging with all its derivative on bounded subsets of lR x 3 1 
to some smooth map v : lR X 3 1 ----t M. Hence we may assume without loss of 
generality that (vn ) converges to some v tf- U. We observe that for every R > 0

in view of (6.107). If R ----> 00, we obtain 
Clearly v satisfies the partial differential equation 
8v 
8v 
I 
8s +J(v)8s +H(t,v)=O. 
This implies that v E X 00 hence contradicting the fact that v rf. U. 
Summing up we have shown that for a given open neighbourhood U of Xoo in 
Coo (lR. x S\ M), there exists To such that, for T ~ To, the set (J"T (X T) belongs to 
U. Consequently, we have the following commutative diagram 
j 
U •• --~ 
XT ----+-. M 
where the maps TT, Too and TU are the evaluation maps at the point (s, t) = (0,0). 
Assume now that Tr is injective in cohomology. Then TU is also injective and 
we consider the following diagram for the Alexander-Spanier cohomology: 
In view of the continuity property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology, we 
can take the direct limit over all open neighborhoods U of Xoo in Coo (JR. x Sl, M) 
and conclude that the map T;:' is injective. We see that the set of bounded solutions 
contains the cohomology of the underlying manifold M, in particular cup-length 
(Xoo) ~ cup-length (M). Applying the Ljusternik-Schnirelman Theorem (Theorem 
6) to the continuous gradient-like flow on X oo , we conclude the desired statement 
Theorem 9. (A. Floer, H. Hofer) Assume (M, w) is a compact symplectic manifold 
satisfying [wll7r2(M) = O. Then every smooth time-periodic Hamiltonian vector 
field x = XH(X) on M possesses at least cup-length (M) + 1 contractible periodic 
solutions of period 1. 

246 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
In order to complete the proof of Theorem 9, we still have to verify that the 
map Tr is injective. Proceeding as in Section 6.2, we shall use Fredholm theory in 
order to approximate X T by smooth compact manifolds of dimension 2n, whose 
cohomology can be estimated using degree theory. For the following we choose a 
fixed number T > 5 and consider the operator L = LT as a smooth section of the 
bundle 
u 
over W1,P(ST, M). We abbreviate this bundle by 
The idea now is to homotope the given section L to the Cauchy-Riemann type 
section %s + J %t by considering the homotopy p ~ L p , 0 :s; p :s; 1, defined by 
Lp(v) = Tv + J(v)(Tv)j + PX(s)[H'(t, v)ds - J(v)H'(t, v)dt]. 
Introducing the evaluation map T : B ----7 M by v ~ v(O, 0) we define the associated 
homotopy L p, 0 :s; p :s; 1 by 
This is, by definition, a map from B into £ x M, for every 0 :s; p :s; 1. We may 
view £ x M as a Banach manifold bundle over B. For p = 0, the equation Lo(v) = 
(0, m), for given m E M, only has the constant solution Vo == m, since there are 
no nontrivial holomorphic spheres because of our assumption [W]17f2(M) = 0 on 
the manifold M. The linearization at this particular section Vo gives in the first 
component the linear Cauchy-Riemann operator, and in the second component 
the evaluation at O. To be more precise, denoting by D = L~ (vo) the linearization 
at the particular point Vo == m, one computes that 
Dh = (Th + J(m) (Th)j, h(O)). 
In view of the results in Appendix 4, the operator D : W1,P(ST, TmM) 
----7 
LP(v(jAM ) X TmM is an isomorphism. Now we use the Z2-degree for Fredholm 
sections having Fredholm index zero. Given the necessary compactness conditions 
we have just demonstrated that this degree is equal to 1. Let us assume for the mo-
ment that the set of solutions of Lp( v) = 0,0 :s; p :s; 1 is compact. Then there exists 
an open neighborhood of this solution set on which the Fredholm map is proper, 
see S. Smale [201]. Consequently, by the homotopy property of the Z2-index, the 
original map for p = 1 given by v ~ (Ll(V),T(V)) has also Z2-degree equal to 1. 
To continue our line of thought, let us also assume for the moment that the image 
of the map v ~ Ll (v) is transversal to the zero section OE of the bundle £. Then 

6.4 ELLIPTIC METHODS AND SYMPLECTIC FIXED POINTS 
247 
the preimage of OE is a smooth compact submanifold ~ of B with dimension 2n. 
Moreover, the evaluation map T := TI~ : ~ ---> M, defined by v f---+ v(O, 0) will have 
Z2-mapping degree equal to 1. This allows us to argue precisely as in Proposition 5 
of Section 6.2 in order to prove that in Alexander-Spanier cohomology the map T;' 
is injective as desired, hence completing the proof of Theorem 9. To reach this con-
clusion, we assumed all the necessary compactness properties and, in addition, the 
transversality of the image of v f---+ L1 ( v) to the zero section OE. The transversal-
ity can be established by an arbitrary COO-small perturbation of the Hamiltonian 
H. However, the argument is quite intricate and we refer the reader to A. Floer, 
H. Hofer and D. Salamon [87] for a proof. Hence with this perturbation argument 
together with the continuity property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology, we 
are left with the compactness question, and it remains to prove the following 
Proposition 12. Assume 2 < p < 00 and [W]I7r2(M) = 0. Then the set of solutions 
XT : = {(p, v) E [0,1] X W 1,P(ST, M) I Lp(v) = O} 
is compact in [0,1] x W 1,P(ST, M). 
Proof of Proposition 12. If v E XT we define the number c:(v) 2:: ° by 
(6.111) 
c:(v) = inf{c: > ° I there exists ZEST 
2-p 
satisfying IVvlp,Be(z) = c:-p-} • 
Here Bc(z) denotes the c:-ball around Z for some fixed metric on ST. (The choice 
of the metric is irrelevant since ST is compact.) Note that the function c: 
f---+

c:----p IVvlp,Be(z) is nondecreasing. Assume now that 
Then 
inf c:( v) == c: > ° . 
vEXT

c: ----p 
for every ZEST, and hence we have a W 1'P-bound for XT. This bound implies the 
compactness of XT in [0,1] x W 1,P(ST, M) as we shall show next. Viewing M as 
a subset of some ]RN, we can consider W 1,P(ST, M) as a subset of W 1,P(ST, ]RN). 
Pick a sequence (Pk, Vk) EXT; then we have to find a convergent subsequence. 
By taking a suitable subsequence we can assume that Pk ---> p, and Vk ---> v in 
CO(ST, ]RN) (in view of the compact embedding of W 1,P(ST, ]RN) C CO(ST, ]RN)) 
and Vk ~ v weakly in W 1,P(ST, ]RN) for some v E W 1,P(ST, ]RN) (in view of 
the reflexivity of the space W 1,P(ST,]RN)). We shall show that Vk is a Cauchy 
sequence in W 1,P(ST, ]RN). Since we have convergence in CO(ST, ]RN) we now can 
work locally in charts of ST and of M as well. Any difficulty that may arise occurs 
near the boundary aZT c ST of cylinder ZT CST, since away from this boundary, 

248 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
the maps u E XT are smooth (by elliptic regularity theory) and we can therefore 
establish Coo-bounds arguing as above. Hence we carry out the local argument 
for the worst case only focussing on the lower cap of 8T . In order to find local 
coordinates on 8T near the boundary aZT belonging to the lower cap we take a 
biholomorphic embedding 'P of [-1, 1] x 8 1 into 8T satisfying 'P(s, t) = (s-T, t) for 
all 0 ~ s ~ 1. Choosing now symplectic coordinates on M we are confronted with 
the following situation. We have a sequence of mappings Vk E W 1,P(BE (0),]R2n) 
and a sequence of numbers Pk E [0,1] satisfying 
Vk

CO ( BE(O), ]R2n)

where v E W 1,P(BE(0), ]R2n) and v(O) = 0, and where BE(O) C ]R2 is the open disk 
centered at (s, t) = (0,0). Moreover, these maps satisfy the following system of 
first order elliptic partial differential equations 
on BE(O), where X is the characteristic function of the positive half line in s. We 
conclude that v solves the equation 
av 
av 
as + J(v) at + px(s)H'(t,v) = O. 
We shall prove that Vk is a Cauchy sequence in W 1,P(Bp(0),]R2n) for some small 
p> o. Let (3 : ]R2 ...... [0,1] be a smooth function having its support in the unit disk 
and taking on the value 1 on the smaller disk of radius 1/2. For T > 0 we then 
define the function (3r on ]R2 by (3r(z) = (3(Z/T). By Jo we denote the constant 
almost complex structure J(O) on ]R2n. Finally, we write 1.li for the Wi'P-norm 
on the c:-disk in ]R2, recalling that 2 < P < 00 and fixed. If 0 < T < c: we now 
compute, using the classical estimate (6.105) for the Cauchy-Riemann operator,

Here a( T) -t 0 for T -t 0, and Cl ( T) is a constant depending on T. Hence, if T > 0 
is small enough,

By assumption, IVkll is a bounded sequence, IVk - vlo -t 0, J(Vk) -t J(v) uni-
formly on Be(O) and IPkH'(t, Vk) - PXH'(t, v)lo -t o. Consequently Vk -t v in 
W 1,P(Bo(0),lR2n ) for some 8 > 0 sufficiently small. Covering ST by finitely many 
charts we have demonstrated the Vk -t v in W1,P(ST, M), so that X T is compact, 
as claimed in the proposition. 
To finish our argument, it remains to verify our assumption that the numbers 
c(v) are uniformly bounded away from 0 on the set XT . We argue by contradiction, 
assuming that we have no uniform W1'P-bound on X T, that we find a sequence 
(Pk,Vk) EXT satisfying c(Vk) -t O. By the definition of c(v) we find a sequence 
Zk EST such that with Ck := c(Vk) we have

p-2 
1 = c;;:' IV'Vklo,Bek(Zk) . 
Since Ck -t 0, and since we have Coo bounds away from azT , we deduce that dist 
(Zk' aZT) -t o. Hence, after taking a subsequence, we can assume that Zk -t Zo E 
aZT. The argument now is similar to the one used previously in the bubbling off 
analysis. Namely we rescale near Zk and obtain in this way a new sequence for which 
we have a WI~:-bound. Therefore, arguing as above, the new sequence, Uk, will be 
WI~: -precompact. Hence taking a convenient subsequence we can pass to the limit 
and obtain a solution v E W1,P(C, M) of Vs + J(v)Vt = 0 on C, which is nonzero.

which follows immediately from the estimate before Lemma 3. Arguing now as in 
the proof of Theorem 8, we arrive at a contradiction to our topological assumption 
[wll7r2(M) = O. The proof of Proposition 12, and therefore the proof of Theorem 
9 is complete .•

CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Remarks: We note that the torus (T2n, w) meets the assumption of Theorem 9 for 
every symplectic structure w. 
Theorem 9 is due to A. Floer [86] and H. Hofer [115], 1987. They both derive the 
result from a more general intersection result for compact Lagrangian manifolds. 
M. Chaperon, in his Bourbaki lecture [42] 1982-83, had already noticed that the 
variational approach is applicable to the global intersection problem of Lagrangian 
manifolds suggested by V.L Arnold in [9]. 
The cohomology in the above statement uses Z2 coefficients and we would 
like to point out that the statement actually holds for every coefficient field. The 
proof, however, requires more intricate tools from Fredholm theory and algebraic 
topology. The crucial point is to resolve a number of orientation questions for a 
distinguished class of Fredholm operators. For the technology involved, we refer to 
A. Floer and H. Hofer [89]. It turns out that XT has a natural orientation inherited 
from the orientation of (M,w) provided it is a manifold. 
The above proof of the Arnold conjecture for a general symplectic manifold 
(M,w) crucially uses the restrictive assumption requiring [W]I7f2(M) = 0, and 
we point out that without this assumption the conjecture is still open. However, 
more can be said if one (a priori) requires that all the I-periodic solutions of the 
Hamiltonian vector field under consideration are nondegenerate, as we shall see in 
the next section. 
6.5 
FIoer's approach to Morse theory for the action functional 
We shall sketch Floer's seminal approach to solving the Arnold conjecture in the 
nondegenerate case where one assumes that all the I-periodic solutions of the 
Hamiltonian system on (M,w) are nondegenerate. Since M is compact, there are 
only finitely many such I-periodic solutions. Floer studies the set of bounded or-
bits of the unregularized gradient equation defined by the action functional on the 
space of contractible loops of M. The bounded orbits are special solutions of a dis-
tinguished system of first order elliptic equations of Cauchy-Riemann type, as we 
have shown above. But unlike the general case studied in the previous section, in 
the nondegenerate case the bounded orbits tend in a strong sense asymptotically 
to the I-periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian equation. This additional structure 
of the solution set is used by Floer in order to construct by means of Fredholm 
theory a chain complex generated by the finitely many I-periodic solutions. The 
homology of this complex is called Floer homology; it is an invariant of the under-
lying manifold. By continuing the complex to the classical Morse complex defined 
by the gradient system iJ = - \l H (y) of the Hamiltonian function on M, Floer fi-
nally shows that his homology is a model of the singular homology of the manifold. 
This then finishes the proof of the Arnold conjecture.

We consider a compact symplectic manifold (M,w) of dimension 2n restricted 
by the requirement that [wll7r2(M) = O. This means that the integral of the sym-
plectic structure vanishes over every sphere

To the smooth time-dependent Hamiltonian function H : 8 1 X M -+ JR., periodic 
in time, H(t,x) = H(t + I,x) for t E JR. and x E M we associate as usual the 
Hamiltonian vector field X H 
: JR. x M -+ TM by w(XH ,·) = -dxH(t,x). The 
solutions x(t) of the time-dependent Hamiltonian equation 
(6.113) 
define the flow 'lj;t by 'lj;t(x(O)) = x(t). We are looking for periodic solutions x(t + 
1) = x(t) which are contractible loops on M, x ~ O. We shall assume that all the 
contractible periodic solutions x( t) are nondegenerate, requiring for the flow map 
'lj; = 'lj;1 that 
(6.114) 
det(I-d'lj;(x(O))) #0. 
By PH we shall denote the set of these periodic solutions: 
(6.115) 
PH = {x: 8 1 -+ M I x(t + 1) = x(t),x solves 
(6.113) and (6.114), and x ~ O} . 
Note that this is a finite set, since M is compact and the nondegenerate I-periodic 
solutions are isolated in M. By n we shall denote the set of smooth contractible 
loops "( of M, where, as usual, 8 1 = JR.jZ. A loop is represented by its cover 
"( : JR. -+ M satisfying "((t + 1) = "((t). The required I-periodic solutions are

is assumed to be contractible and it follows from the assumption (6.112) that the 
first integral on the right hand side of (6.116) does not depend on the choice of 
the extension and hence depends only on the loop "(. With T-yn we shall denote

the tangent space at "( E n consisting of the smooth vector fields ~ E Coo ("(*T M)

direction of ~, one finds readily that 
1

d'PH(ry)~ = J 
{w(i',~) + dH(t, "()~ } dt , 
o 
which indeed vanishes for every ~ E T,n if and only if the loop "( E n is a solution 
of the Hamiltonian equation (6.113). It is convenient to choose an almost complex 
structure J on M compatible with w (see Chapter 1). This is an endomorphism 
J E Coo (End TM), i.e., Jx E £(TxM, TxM) satisfying J2 = -1 such that 
(6.118) 
defines a Riemannian metric g on M. The Hamiltonian vector field is then repre-
sented by 
(6.119) 
XH(t,x) = J(x)\lH(t, x) , 
where \l denotes the gradient of a function on M with respect to the x-variable 
in the metric g above. For the derivative we obtain 
1 
(6.120) 
d'PH(ry)~ = J

so that the gradient of 'PH with respect to an induced L2 metric on n is given by 
(6.121) 
However, the gradient equation

does not determine a flow. As we have pointed out in the previous section, due to 
a loss of derivatives there is no Banach space setup in which grad 'PH(X) can be 
considered as a vector field on a Banach manifold. Indeed the initial value problem 
defined by (6.122) on n is not well-posed. Floer views a solution x of (6.122) as a 
map 
(6.123) 
u: lR x Sl ----+ M, (s,t) f---t u(s,t) = u(s,t+ 1)

The crucial objects from now on, are therefore the solutions u : JR. x 8 1 -+ M of 
the nonlinear partial differential equation (6.124), which are contractible so that 
u(s,·) E O. These solutions correspond to the flow lines of the gradient equation 
(6.122). The equation (6.124) is a perturbation of a Cauchy-Riemann equation. A 
smooth map u : 8 2 -+ M solving the Cauchy-Riemann equation

is called a holomorphic sphere. It satisfies 
(6.126) 
so that our assumption (6.112) excludes, in particular, nonconstant holomorphic 
spheres. 
From the torus case we know that not all solutions of (6.124) are relevant 
and we are interested only in the set of "bounded orbits" which we denote by 
M == M (H, J). This set is defined as the set of smooth mappings u : JR. x 8 1 -+ M 
which are contractible, solve the equation (6.124) and have, in addition, finite 
"energy"

Equivalently M is the space of contractible solutions u along which the decreasing 
function 'PHU(S) remains bounded for all s E JR., where u(s)(t) = u(s, t) EO. 
Floer proves in [85] that the space M of bounded solutions of the partial 
differential equation (6.124) has a structure which looks like that of a Morse-
Smale system on a smooth, compact, and finite dimensional manifold, as we now 
describe. 
Since M is compact and since [w] vanishes over 7r2(M) according to the as-
sumption (6.112) it follows using elliptic regularity theory that the set of solutions 
M is compact in the topology of uniform convergence with all derivatives on com-
pact sets. This is not easy to prove and we refer to A. Floer [85], D. Salamon [188], 
and H. Hofer and D. Salamon [119]. Moreover, for every bounded orbit u E M 
there exists a pair x, y E PH of periodic solutions, such that u is a connecting 
orbit from y to x, i.e., 
(6.128) 
lim u(s, t) = y(t) , 
lim u(s, t) = x(t) , 
8----;.-00

the convergence being uniformly in t as lsi -+ 00 and ~~ converging to zero again 
uniformly in t. Given two periodic solutions x, y E PH we abbreviate by 
(6.129) 
M(y,x) = M(y,x;H,J) 

254 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
the set of solutions u E M satisfying the asymptotic boundary conditions (6.128). 
For the energy one computes 
(6.130) 
E(u) = 'PH(Y) - 'PH (x) , 
if u E M(y, x) . 
The energy is positive for nonconstant orbits. From the previous section we know 
that the set M of solutions consists of the periodic solutions and the connecting 
orbits 
(6.131) 
M = U M(y,x). 
y,xEPH 
The group IR acts naturally on M by shifting u(s, t) in the s direction, hence 
defining a continuous flow on the space M. Under this action the sets M(y,x) are 
invariant subspaces. Their compactness properties can be formulated analogously 
to the finite dimensional Morse theory as represented by M. Schwarz in his book 
[191]: 
Proposition 12. A sequence U y E M(y,x) possesses a subsequence with the fol-
lowing property: there is a sequence st E IR of times, j = 1,2, ... , m, such that 
uy(s + st, t) converges together with all its derivatives uniformly on compact sets 
to solutions ui E M(xi , Xi-I) where xi E PH for j = 0,1, ... m, with xO = x and 
xm=y.

Fig. 6.10 
Using of Fredholm theory in the appropriate functional analytic setting, one 
proves that for a generic choice of the pair (H,J) the sets M(y,x) are smooth, 
finite dimensional manifolds. Linearizing the equation (6.124) in the direction of 
a vector field e E Coo ( u * T M) along u leads to the linear first order differential 
operator 
(6.132) 
au 
F(u)e:= V'se + J(u)V'te + V't;.J(u) at + V't; V'H(t,u) , 

6.5 FLOER'S APPRAOCH TO MORSE THEORY ... 
255 
where \7 s, \7 t, \7 e denote the covariant derivatives with respect to the metric 9 
associated with J. If u : lR x 8 1 ~ M is any smooth map connecting y with x, 
hence satisfying (6.128) for two nondegenerate solutions y,x E PH, then F(u) 
is a Fredholm operator between appropriate Sobolev spaces. A pair (H, J) with 
an almost complex structure J satisfying (6.118) is called regular, if F(u) is a 
surjective linear operator for every u E M. It can be proved that the set of regular 
pairs is dense with respect to the COO-topology, using of the Sard-Smale theorem. 
It then follows by the implicit function theorem that M (y, x) is indeed a smooth 
manifold whose local dimension near u E M(y,x) is 
(6.133) 
dim M(y,x) = 
Index F(u) . 
This index depends only on the boundary condition on u, i.e., on y, x E PH, if we 
require, in addition to (6.112), that the first Chern class of (T M, J) vanishes over 
7r2(M). Note that w determines an almost complex structure J satisfying (6.118) 
uniquely up to homotopy and we denote by C1 = c1(TM) E H2(M) the first Chern 
class of TM. We shall assume that [c1ll7r2(M) = 0 requiring that the integral of 
the 2-form C1 vanishes over every sphere 
(6.134)

U*C1 = 0,

Consider a nondegenerate periodic orbit x E PH. Since x : 8 1 ~ M is con-
tractible we can extend it to a map u : D ~ M of the closed disk D satisfying 
ul8D = x. Now we take a trivialization of u*(TM); it determines a trivialization of 
x*(TM). Note that if we take another extension v: D ~ M of x, we find another 
trivialization of x*(TM) which, however, is homotopic in view of the assumption 
bll7r2(M) = O. In the trivialized tangent bundle x*(TM), the linearized flow of 
the Hamiltonian vector field XH along x determines a unique Maslov-type index 
JL(H, x) E Z associated with x. (The integers are in one-to-one correspondence 
with the homotopy classes of linear Hamiltonian systems on (lR2n,wo) which are 
periodic in time and nondegenerate). This gives 
(6.135) 
JLH: PH----+Z' 
x~JL(H,x). 
If a smooth map u : lR x 8 1 ~ M satisfies (6.128) for two nondegenerate periodic 
solutions y,x E PH of the Hamiltonian vector field, the Fredholm index of F(u) is 
given by 
(6.136) 
Index F(u) = JL(H,y) - JL(H,x) . 
We conclude for a generic pair (H,J) that dimM(y,x) = JLH(y) - JLH(X). For 
the definition of the index JLH and also for a proof of the above index formula, we 
refer to D. Salamon and E. Zehnder [190l. We remark that if [c1ll7r2(M) =I- 0, the 
index (6.135) would depend on the homotopy class of the chosen extension. The 

256 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY •.• 
ambiguity would be the integer 2N, where NZ = {(U*CI)[S2] I U E 1T2(M)}. Hence 
J-L(H) is only well-defined as a map J-LH : PH -+ Zj2NZ. 
We are now prepared to define the Floer homology groups associated to a 
regular pair (H, J) on (M,w). With C = C(M,H) we shall denote the vector space 
over Z2 generated by the finitely many elements of the set PH of nondegenerate 
contractible periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian vector field. This vector space comes 
with a grading defined by the index map J-L : PH -+ Z: 
C 
E9 Ck 
kEZ 
Ck(M,H) = spanZ2 {x E PH 1J-L(x,H) = k}. 
(6.137) 
Consider now y,x E PH satisfying J-L(Y) - J-L(x) = 1. Then the manifold M(y,x) 
is one-dimensional dimM(y,x) = 1. In view of the compactness, combined with 
the manifold structure, it can be shown [85] that this manifold has finitely many 
components, each of which consists of a connecting orbit together with all its 
translates by the time -s shift. This was used by Floer to construct a linear 
boundary operator 0 : C -+ C respecting the grading by counting the connecting 
orbits modulo 2. The map Ok = ok(M, H, J) : Ck -+ Ck-I is defined by 
(6.138) 
(oy,x) x, 
{XEPH I Jl(x)=k-I} 
for y E PH satisfying J-L(Y) = k. The matrix element (oy,x) E Z2 is the number 
of components of M (y, x) counted modulo 2. Floer proves [85] that a 0 a = 0, so 
that the pair (C, 0) defines a chain complex. Its homology 
(6.139) 
is called the Floer homology of the pair (H, J) on (M, w). 
In order to explain the relation Ok 0 Ok+1 = 0 for the boundary operators 
Ok+1 : Ck+} -+ Ck, we pick x E Ck+I, Y E Ck and z E Ck-I. Assume that there 
exist connections U E M (x, y) and v E M (y, z). Then we may view the pair (u, v) 
as a "broken trajectory" connecting x with z. By a perturbation argument, called 
the gluing method, Floer established in [85] a unique I-parameter family of as-
sociated true connections in M(x, z). Taking the quotient by the lR-action of the 
time-s shift, one finds this way a connected I-dimensional manifold without bound-
aries of unparameterized orbits which represents one component of M(x, z). Such 
I-dimensional manifolds are either circles or intervals with two ends. The compact-
ness argument in Proposition 12 shows that each end converges in a suitable sense 
to a well-defined broken trajectory (u', v') E M(x, y') x M(y', z) for some y' E Ck. 
The gluing construction shows in a reverse process that the broken trajectories 
correspond uniquely to such an end. Thus, the I-dimensional manifold M(x, z)jlR 

6.5 FLOER'S APPRAOCH TO MORSE THEORY ... 
has an even number of ends. 
x 
m(x)=k+l 
m(y) = m(y') = k 
y 
m(z)=k-l 
dimMo(x,z) 
= m(x) - m(z) 
z 
257 
Consequently the "broken trajectories" (u, v) between x and z occur in pairs. 
Since we use £::2 coefficients, we find for every x E Ck+! that 
L (L 
(8X,Y)(8Y,Z)) z = O. 
m(z) = k-l 
m(y) = k 
For the intricate details of this gluing construction we refer to A. Floer [85] and 
C. Taubes [210, 211] and in particular to the recent book by M. Schwarz [191]. 
The chain complex is defined by the one dimensional components of the so-
lution space M of bounded orbits. It is obviously constructed analogously to the 
familiar Morse complex for Morse-Smale gradient flows on finite dimensional com-
pact manifolds. The transversality conditions of the Morse-Smale flow correspond 
to the assumption that the Fredholm operator F( u) is a surjective map which 
is met only "generically" as in the finite dimensional situation. The role of the 
Morse index of a non degenerate critical point of the Morse-Smale flow is played by 
the integer p,(x, H) associated with the nondegenerate contractible periodic orbit 
x E PH. The Morse index of x E PH is infinite! 
Up to now it is conceivable that the space M might be empty and the Floer 
homology groups all trivial. At this point it is useful to recall a crucial aspect of 
C. Conley's index theory for flows on compact spaces: it is designed in such a way 
that it is invariant under continuation. Prompted by this theory, Floer established 
an analogous homotopy invariance property for his homology groups, which can be 
used to show that the groups are independent of (H, J) used for its construction. 
A special choice of Hand J then allowed him to compute the homology: 
Theorem 10. (Floer continuation) For every two regular pairs (HQ, JQ) and 
(Hf3, J(3) there exists a natural isomorphism of the Floer homology respecting 

258 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
the grading 
Moreover, if (HI, JI) is another regular pair, then 
We see that the Floer homology FH*(M, H, J) is independent of the regular 
pair (H, J) used in the construction of the connecting orbits of PH; hence it is an 
invariant of the underlying manifold (M,w). We have a category whose objects 
are the Floer homology groups associated with regular pairs (H, J) and whose 
morphisms are the natural isomorphisms 'ljJ{3a induced by regular homotopies as 
explained below. In the terminology of C. Conley [54] such a category with unique 
morphisms is called a connected simple system. 
We shall sketch the ideas of the proof which is again based on special solutions 
of a P.D.E. and Fredholm theory. We follow the presentation in D. Salamon and 
E. Zehnder [190]. In order to construct a homomorphism lP{3a : C(M, Ha, Ja) -'> 
C(M,H{3,J{3), we choose a smooth homotopy Ha{3: lR x 8 1 X M -'> lR of Hamil-
tonian functions together with a smooth homotopy of almost complex structures 
Ja{3 : lR x M -'> End (T M) such that Ha{3 (s, t, x) and Ja{3 (s, x) are independent 
of s for lsi sufficiently large and satisfy

before, a solution of bounded energy satisfies the boundary conditions. We shall 
abbreviate by 
(6.144) 
M(xQ, Xf3, H Qf3, JQ(3) 
the set of smooth solutions u : lR. X 8 1 ---> M of (6.142) and (6.143). This set 
is analyzed locally by linearizing the equation in the direction of a vector field 
e E COO(u*TM) along u which leads to a linear operator Ff3Q(u) : Wk,P(u*TM) ---> 
W k- 1,p( u*T M) between appropriate Sobolev spaces. For every smooth map u : 
lR.x 8 1 ---> M satisfying the boundary conditions (6.143) with xQ, xf3 nondegenerate, 
the operator Ff3Q (u) is Fredholm and its index is computed as 
(6.145) 
Moreover, for a regular homotopy from (HQ, JQ) to (Hf3, J(3) the operator is surjec-
tive. Here a pair (HQf3, JQ(3) is called regular, if both pairs (HQ, JQ) and (Hf3, J(3) 
are regular and if the linear operator Ff3Q ( u) is surjective for every solution u 
of (6.142) and (6.143) for every xQ E PH'" and xf3 E PHf3. Floer proved [84, 85] 
that the set of regular homotopies connecting regular pairs is dense in the set 
of all smooth homotopies connecting (HQ, JQ) to (Hf3, JQ) with respect to the 
Coo topology. (Floer carried out his proof for the analogous geometric problem of 
Lagrangian intersections.) It then follows that the space M(xQ,xf3,HQf3,JQf3) of 
connecting orbits is a finite dimensional manifold and 
(6.146) 
This allows us to construct a chain homomorphism 
<pf3Q = <p(HQf3, r
(3 ) : Ck(M, HQ) ---> Ck(M, H(3) 
by counting the connecting orbits modulo 2 between periodic solutions having the 
same index 
(6.147) 
p,(xf3 ,Hf3)=k 
where p,(xQ, HQ) = k and where (<pf3QxQ, x(3 ) is the number of solutions modulo 2. 
One can show that for every regular homotopy this linear map <pf3Q is a chain 
homomorphisms, i.e., satisfies fjf3<pf3Q = <pf3QfjQ. Moreover, it respects the grading. 
It, therefore, induces a natural homomorphism '¢f3Q of Floer homology, which 
turns out to be independent of the choice of the homotopy (H Q f3, J Q (3). More 
precisely one shows that for two regular homotopies (H~f3, J~(3) and (Hff3 , Jf(3) 
from (HQ, JQ) to (Hf3, J(3), the associated chain homomorphisms <pgQ and <pfQ are 
chain homotopy equivalent. This finishes our sketch of Theorem 10. 
Finally, in order to compute the homology, Floer used the continuation theorem 
and connected a regular pair (HQ, JQ) with a very special pair (H, J), whose Floer 
homology agrees with the homology of the Morse complex defined by the gradient 
flow of the function H : M ---> lR. on the underlying manifold M.

In particular, the Floer homology vanishes for Ikl > n.

of time t, and which is a Morse-function, such that all its critical points on M 
are nondegenerate. Moreover, we assume that H is sufficiently small in the C 2 
topology. Then, as we have seen above, the periodic solutions of period 1 of the 
Hamiltonian system ± = XH(X) on M are constant and agree with the critical 
points of H such that in this case 
(6.148) 
PH = {x(t) = x E M I dH(x) = O} . 
In this situation of a "small" Hamiltonian H, the Morse index indH(x) of the 
critical point x of H is related to the index /-l(x, H) of the constant I-periodic 
solution x(t) = x of ± = XH(x) by 
(6.149) 
see [190]. We can choose an almost complex structure J such that (H, J) is a regular 
pair. One then shows that the solutions U E M(y,x) for X,y E PH satisfying 
/-l(y, H) - /-l(x, H) = 1 of the partial differential equation (6.124) and (6.128) 

6.5 FLOER'S APPRAOCH TO MORSE THEORY ... 
261 
are also independent of the time t. Hence setting U(8, t) = ,(8), they satisfy the 
gradient equation 
(6.150) 
~; + V' H( ,(8)) = 0 on M , 
and the boundary conditions ,(8) -
Y as 8 -
-00 and ,(8) -
X as 8 -
+00. 
These solutions agree with the I-dimensional connecting orbits ofthe Morse-Smale 
gradient flow x = -V'H(x) for which 
(6.151) 
whenever ind F(u) = indH(y) - indH(x) = 1. Hence, the chain complex C(M, H) 
agrees with the familiar Morse complex, in which Ck(H) = {x E MldH(x) = 0 
and indH(x) = k} and where the boundary operator 8k = 8k(H, J) : Ck -
Ck-l 
defined above counts the connecting orbits (mod 2) of the gradient flow on M. It 
is well-known, that its homology groups 
(6.152) 
agree with the singular homology of M 
(6.153) 
For a proof we refer to D. Salamon [188] and to the recent monograph by M. 
Schwarz [191] in which he develops a Morse homology theory on finite dimensional 
manifolds based on the trajectory spaces of Morse functions. We see in view of 
(6.149) that Floer's chain complex for our special symplectic manifold (M,w) 
agrees with the familiar Morse complex of a gradient flow of a function, the grading 
being shifted by n: 
(6.154) 
Consequently, Floer's connecting orbits of nondegenerate periodic solutions can 
serve as a model for the homology of the underlying manifold. We conclude, in 
particular, that 
(6.155) 
L tJ1.(x,H) = P(t, M)C n + (1 + t)Q(t) . 
XEPH 
This Morse equation relates the nondegenerate contractible periodic solutions x E 
PH having indices /L(x, H) E IE to the topology of M described by the Poincare 
polynomial P(t,M). Recall that we posed the assumptions WI7r2 = 0 = cll7r2 on 
(M,w). In case of a time-independent and small Morse function H, the equation 
(6.155) becomes the familiar Morse equation 
(6.156) 
L 
tm(x) = P(t, M) + (1 + t)Q(t) 
V'H(x)=O 
which relates the critical points of the function H to the Poincare polynomial 
P(t, M). In particular, we conclude from (6.155)

CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Theorem 12. (Floer) Assume the compact symplectic manifold (M, w) satisfies 
WI1l"2(M) = 0 and cll1l"2(M) = 0, assume the time periodic Hamiltonian vector 
field x = XH(X) on M possesses nondegenerate I-periodic solutions only. Then 
their number is at least the sum of the Betti numbers 5B(M, Z2) of M. 
For example 1l"2 (T2n) = 0 so that every symplectic torus (T2n, w) meets the 
assumption of the theorem. Actually Floer proved in [85] a more general result, 
assuming merely that (M, w) a monotone in the sense that 
(6.157) 
J 
U*Cl = A J 
u*w, 
8 2 
8 2 
for every sphere U : 52 --., M, with a constant A > O. 
More recently, H. Hofer and D. Salamon succeeded, [119], in defining the Floer 
homology groups under the assumption that 
(6.158) w(A) ::; 0 for every A E 1l"2(M) satisfying 3 - n ::; cl(A) < 0 , 
and to compute them in the cases cll1l"2(M) = 0 and N ~ ~ dim(M), where 
NZ = Cl(1l"2(M)) c Z, proving the Arnold conjecture in these cases. They demon-
strate that the Floer groups form a module over Novikov's ring of generalized 
Laurent series. Such a ring was introduced by S. Novikov in his generalization of 
Morse theory for closed one-forms [170]. Under the assumption (6.158) the ob-
tained theory is a N ovikov type variant of Floer homology. Modifying the ideas of 
Hofer and Salamon, K. Ono [172] gave a modified construction of Floer's homology 
theory, again under the assumption (6.158), which can be computed without addi-
tional hypothesis. It turns out that for a suitable coefficient field these Floer groups 
are isomorphic to the singular homology groups of the manifold establishing, in 
particular, the Arnold conjecture for the dimension 2,4 and 6 in which (6.158) is 
vacuous. Manifolds meeting the condition (6.158) have the property used in the 
proof that, for a generic almost complex structure, there is no holomorphic sphere 
of negative Chern number. 
The Arnold conjecture for a general compact symplectic manifold with dim 
M ~ 8 is still open. 
It should be mentioned that the Floer homology groups H F* can be defined 
for integer coefficients Z (instead of Z2) and, therefore, for every Abelian group. 
In order to do this one has to assign an integer + 1 or -1 to every connecting orbit 
U E M (y, x) whenever p,(y) - p,( x) = 1. However, the determination of such an 
orientation is quite subtle and requires a consistent orientation of the moduli spaces 
M(y, x) for which we refer to A. Floer and H. Hofer [89]. Thus all the statements 
described above are true not only for Z2 coefficients but for Z coefficients as well. 
The I-periodic solutions of x = XH(X) on M correspond in a one-to-one way 
to the fixed points of the Hamiltonian map 'ljJl which is the time-l map of the 
flow generated by the Hamiltonian vector field. Since M is compact one should 

6.5 FLOER'S APPRAOCH TO MORSE THEORY ... 
263 
expect, in view of Poincare's recurrence theorem, in addition to these fixed points 
an abundance of periodic points having large periods. Indeed, if one of the fixed 
points is of general elliptic type as explained in the introduction, then it is a cluster 
point of other periodic points whose prime periods tend to infinity. This follows 
simply by the Birkhoff-Lewis theorem, a local theorem for the proof of which we 
refer to J. Moser [164]. Unfortunately, our global approach to the existence of the 
fixed points gives only little information about their nature and, in particular, 
no information about their nonlinear Birkhoff invariants required to deduce the 
periodic points nearby. We shall show next under additional assumptions on the 
I-periodic solutions that infinitely many periodic solutions are deduced from the 
Floer homology. A I-periodic solution x(t) = x(t + 1) can be considered as a T-
periodic solutions x(t) = x(t + T) for every integer TEN, which is then called 
the T-iterated solution of x and denoted by x T • We call a I-periodic solution x 
strongly nondegenerate if all its iterates x T are nondegenerate, i.e., if 
for all positive integers T, not only for T = 1. 
Theorem 13. Assume the compact symplectic manifold (M,w) satisfies WI1l"2 = 0 
and c111l"2 = 0 and assume H : 8 1 X M ~ IR is a smooth Hamiltonian so that all 
the contractible I-periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian system are strongly non-
degenerate. Then there are infinitely many contractible periodic solutions having 
large integer periods. 
This is a special case of a more general statement proved by D. Salamon and 
E. Zehnder in [190] which requires merely that the I-periodic solutions x(t) = 
x(t+I) are weakly nondegenerate, i.e., they possess at least one Floquet multiplier 
not equal to 1 so that a(d'¢l(x(O))) =I- {I}. The condition on 1l"2(M) cannot be 
removed as is demonstrated by the example of a rotation on M = 8 2 with irrational 
frequency (Fig. 6.12). 
This is a Hamiltonian map, but has only two periodic points, namely the 
strongly nondegenerate fixed points at the north and the south pole. 
In sharp contrast to this example, an area preserving diffeomorphism of 8 2 
having ~ 3 fixed points, has automatically infinitely many periodic points. This 
striking phenomenon has been discovered by J.M. Gamboudo and P. Le Calvez 
[103] and J. Franks [96]. One is tempted to conjecture that every Hamiltonian 
map on a compact symplectic manifold (M,w) possessing more fixed points than 
necessarily required by the V. Arnold conjecture possesses always infinitely many 
periodic points. Similarly one could expect, that a compact and strictly convex 
hypersurface 8 C 1R4 , carries either 2 or 00 many closed characteristics. 
Theorem 13 is an easy consequence of the Floer homology. We make use of 
the fact proved in [190], that for the index t-t(x, H) of a strongly nondegenerate 

264 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
Fig. 6.12 
I-periodic solution x{t) = x{t + 1), the following iteration formula holds 
ll{xT) = ~(T6{X) + rT{x)) . 
Here 6{x) E lR is a mean winding number associated with the I-periodic solution 
and IrT{x)1 < 7fn for every TEN. We see that either IIl{xT)1 -t 00 as T -t 00 or 
III (x T ) I < n for every T. Assume now, by contradiction, that there are only finitely 
many periodic solutions of integer periods. Then they have a common period, say 
To E N, and we pick a prime number T > To. Then all the T-periodic solutions 
of x = XH{X) are iterated I-periodic solutions and hence, are nondegenerate by 
assumption. Considering the Floer complex for the T periodic solutions x E PH{T) 
we conclude that 
IIl{x) I =I- n for all x E PH{T) 
if only T is sufficiently large. Hence we miss the highest and the lowest homology 
groups, in contradiction to the Morse equation (6.I55). Consequently there are 
infinitely many periodic solutions. Modifying this idea it is shown in [190] that 
if there exists only finitely many contractible I-periodic solutions x perhaps even 
degenerate but satisfying L.{x) =I- 0 then, for every TEN large and prime there 
exists a T-periodic solution which is contractible and has prime period T. 
Floer's approach to the Morse theory in the loop space of a compact symplectic 
manifold (M,w) leads to an invariant of the underlying manifold which turned out 
to be the familiar singular homology of M. However, Floer carried out his construc-
tion also for the Chern-Simons functional on the space of SU(2) connections on a 
homology 3 sphere X, see [83]. Here the connecting orbits can be interpreted as 
self-dual Yang-Mills connections on the manifold X x lR with finite Yang-Mills ac-
tion. For this functional, the Floer homology groups are surprising new invariants 
of the underlying homology 3-spheres refining the Casson invariant. Indeed it turns 
out that the Euler characteristic of Floer's instanton homology of X agrees with 

6.6 SYMPLECTIC HOMOLOGY 
265 
double the Casson invariant. We shall not discuss these developments in topology 
here and refer instead to J.C. Sikorav's Seminaire Bourbaki [199J in 1990. Floer's 
instanton homology was extended to general oriented 3-manifolds by K. Fukaya 
in [102J. Recent developments on instanton homology are presented in the Floer 
memorial volumes [120J. 
6.6 Symplectic homology 
In Chapter 3 we introduced the special symplectic capacity eo(M,w) dynamically 
in terms of Hamiltonian systems. The existence proof was based on a distinguished 
critical point of the action functional. This critical point represents a particular 
periodic orbit and the question arises whether the structure of all critical points 
together with their connecting orbits leads to a more subtle symplectic invariant 
which is not necessarily a number anymore. Indeed, combining the construction of 
the capacity Co with Floer's homology construction in the loop space H. Hofer, and 
A. Floer established in [90J a symplectic homology theory. Our aim is to sketch, 
without proofs, this theory which is not yet in its final form. 
We first recall the setting from the previous section and consider a symplectic 
manifold (M,w) satisfying 1l"2(M) = 0, for simplicity. By O(M) we denote the 
set of parameterized contractible loops x : 8 1 -+ M. If H : 8 1 x M -+ lR is a 
time-periodic Hamiltonian, the action functional 'PH : O(M) -+ lR is defined by 
1 
'PH(X) = - J 
x*w + J H(t,x(t)) dt. 
D 
0 
Here x: D -+ M is an extension of x to the closed unit disc D satisfying xloD = x. 
The critical points of 'PH are the contractible I-periodic solutions of the Hamilto-
nian vector field x = XH(X) on M. We shall assume that all of them are nonde-
generate and denote this finite set by PH. By C(M, H) we denote the vector space 
over Z2 generated by PH to be 
C = EBCk, Ck(M,H) = spanZ2 {x E PH I p,(H,x) = k}. 
The grading is determined by the index p,(H, x) E Z intrinsically associated to the 
nondegenerate periodic solutions x E PH. For a generic almost complex structure J 
associated with w there exists a boundary operator Ok = ok(M, H, J) : Ck -+ Ck-l. 
It is defined by counting (mod 2) the connecting orbits M(x-, x+, H, J) which 
connect periodic solutions of index difference p,(H,x-) - p,(H,x+) = 1. The pair 
(C, a) is a chain complex and we denote by 
F (M H J) = ker a 
* 
" 
im a 
the Floer homology of the generic pair (H, J). Turning now to the construction 
of the symplectic homology of (M,w), we first make the observation that for a 

266 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
fixed generic pair (H, J) there exists an additional filtration of the Floer complex 
defined by the values of the functional 'PH on O(M). We define for a E lR U {oo} 
the graded free groups 
Ca(M,H) = EB Ck 
kEZ 
Ck = spanZ2 {x E PH I J1-(H, x) = k and 'PH(X) < a} . 
Assume now that U is a connecting orbit in M(x-, x+, H, J) and denote by Us E 0 
the loops us(t) = u(s, t). By the variational structure, 'PH(X+) ~ 'PH(Us) ~ 
'PH(X-), hence the periodic orbits lying between two different levels together with 
their connecting orbits constitute a subcomplex of the Floer complex. More pre-
cisely 8 = 8( H, J) satisfies 
8: Ck ~ Ck- l . 
Therefore, defining for -00 < a ~ b ~ 00, the quotient group by 
(6.159) 
c[a,b) (H J) = Cb(H, J) 
, 
ca(H,J) ' 
then the boundary map induces a boundary operator 8k : cla,b) ~ cl~~, and we 
can define 
(6.160) 
Yet, this Floer homology group depends on the choice of a generic pair (H, J) and 
is not an invariant of M. The aim is to construct a directed set of very special 
generic pairs, so that the directed limit of the corresponding groups defines a 
symplectic invariant of M. The class of admissible Hamiltonians in a generic pair 
is prompted by the class used in the construction of eo(M,w) in Chapter 3. 
We sketch this construction for compact symplectic manifolds (M,w) possibly 
having a boundary 8M. In the case that 8M # 0 we shall assume that 8M is 
of contact type as defined above. Equivalently, this requires that there exists a 
I-form A on 8M satisfying dA = w on 8M and A(X, e) # 0 for all nonvanishing 
e E Tx(8M) for which w(e, "') = 0 for all '" E Tx(8M). Moreover, we assume for 
simplicity, as above, that 7r2 (M) = O. By H we denote the collection of all smooth 
and time-periodic Hamiltonian functions H : SI X M ~ lR satisfying 
(6.161) supp(H) is compact in SI x (M\8M) and H(SI x M) c (-00,0]. 
Clearly this condition implies that there are many periodic solutions x of X H on M 
which are degenerate and satisfy 'PH(X) = o. In addition to (6.161) we, therefore, 
require that all contractible periodic solutions x of X H satisfying 'PH(X) < 0 
are nondegenerate. Consequently, if -00 ~ a ~ b ~ 0 we can define as above 
the relative Floer groups p[a,b)(H, J). Here, however, not every J is admissible. 

6.6 SYMPLECTIC HOMOLOGY 
267 
The J has to be chosen in such a way that every solution u : ~ x 51 -+ M in 
M(x-, x+, H, J) stays away from the boundary, i.e., u(~x 51) c M\aM, provided 
x- and x+ are contained in M\aM. Such admissible J's do exist; the boundary 
aM is then called J-pseudo convex in the sense of D. McDuff [154]. We shall call 
a pair (H, J) satisfying the above conditions admissible and introduce in the set 
of admissible pairs a partial ordering, by defining (this is not a typing error) 
(H, J) ::; (K, J) ¢=} H(t, x) :::: K(t, x) 
for all (t, x) E 51 X M. For such pairs one can define a monotone homotopy. It 
consists of a pair (L, J), where L : ~ x 51 X M -+ ~ and where the almost complex 
structure J( s, t, x) is adapted to the symplectic form w. Moreover, L = H, J = J 
for s -+ -00 while L = K, J = J for s -+ +00, and ~: ::; O. Given a monotone 
homotopy for (H, J) ::; (K, J) one considers the partial differential equations for 
u: ~ x 51 -+ M:

(s -+ +(0). 
Using the monotonicity assumption we conclude that i.f!K(Y) ::; i.f!H(X). This im-
plies that the boundary operator a preserves the real filtration; this was the reason 
for the monotonicity assumption. Proceeding as in Floer's construction, the com-
binatorics of the set of solutions is used to construct a natural homomorphism 
F[a,b) (H, J) -+ F[a,b) (K, J) 
of :£:2 vector spaces, which is independent of the chosen generic monotone homo-
topy. The partial ordering::; turns the set of admissible pairs (H, J) into a directed 
set, since given (HI, Jd and (H2' J2), there exists an admissible pair (H, J) satis-
fying 
(Hj,Jj ) ::; (H,J) for j = 1,2. 
Hence we may pass to the limit obtaining the symplectic homology group

In addition, if U c M is an open subset, and if Hu consists of those admissible 
pairs (H, J) which are restricted by the requirement that supp(H) c 51 x (U\aM), 
we may take the directed limit over Hu and obtain a symplectic homology group 
of U defined by 
5[:: b) (U) : = dir. lim F[a,b) (H, J).

We next list some of the properties of these groups known so far. It can be shown 
that there are natural homomorphisms of :£:2 vector spaces

Given a symplectic diffeomorphism 'l/J : M -+ M we can define for any admissible 
pair (H, J), with H E 1iu, a new admissible pair (H..p, J..p) as follows: 
H(t,'l/J-l(X)) 
T'l/J( 'l/J-l(x)) J( 'l/J-l(X) )T'l/J-l (x). 
This is used to show that 'l/J induces a natural isomorphism

If U c V then the inclusion map induces a homomorphism 
av,u : St!,b) (U) -+ St!,b) (V) . 
If'l/J : M -+ M is a symplectic diffeomorphism satisfying 'l/J(U) c V, we define the 
induced map 'l/J* by 
'l/J* = av,..p(U) 0 'l/J# : St!,b) (U) -+ St!,b) (V). 
Then if <p : M -+ M is another symplectic diffeomorphism satisfying <p(V) C W, 
one can prove 
aw,<po..p(U) 0 (<p 0 'l/J)# 
(aw,<p(v) 0 <p#) 0 (av,..p(u) 0 'l/J#) 
Moreover, the identity map of M induces the identity map id: S~b) (U) -+ St!,b (U). 
The most useful property is the isotopy invariance formulate~ as follows: i~ 'l/Js : 
M -+ M for 0 ~ s ~ 1 is a smooth family of symplectic diffeomorphisms satisfying 
'l/Js(U) c V for all s, then ('l/Js)* : St!,b)(U) -+ St!,b) (V) is independent of s. 
It is rather difficult to compute the symplectic homology groups sketched above 
and we refer to [51] for computations and applications. It is not surprising anymore 
that the homology groups are related to distinguished periodic orbits, which sit 
on or near the boundary of a domain. This is illustrated by the theorem below. 

6.6 SYMPLECTIC HOMOLOGY 
269 
We consider a compact symplectic manifold (M,w) with boundary 8M -I- 0 
which is exact symplectic, i.e., w = d)" for a I-form )... We assume the boundary 
to be of contact type with respect to )... Then we can define the action spectrum 
u(8M) C JR. as follows: u(8M) = {I J )..1, where x is a periodic solution of the Reeb 
x 
vector field on 8M}, note that iterated solutions are also considered, in particular, 
k· u(8M) c u(8M) for kEN. 
Theorem 14. (K. Cieliebak, A. Fioer, H. Hofer and K. Wysocki [52]) Consider two 
exact symplectic and compact manifolds (M, d)") and (N, dT) with boundaries 8M 
and 8N of contact type with respect to ).. and T. Assume there exists an exact 
symplectic diffeomorphism 
o 
0 
i.p :M-+N 
o 
(i.e., i.p*T -
).. = dF for a smooth function F : M -+ JR.). If the periodic solutions 
on 8M and 8N and all their iterates are nondegenerate, then 
u(8M) = u(8N). 
Examples by Ya. Eliashberg and H. Hofer [75] demonstrate that under the as-
sumptions of the theorem, the flows on 8M and 8N are not necessarily conjugated, 
so that i.p cannot be extended to a symplectic diffeomorphism M -+ N. 
The proof of Theorem 14 is based on the following nontrivial fact [52]. Let 
a < 0 and define 
dM(a) = ~ lim dim s~-c,o+c) (~). 
2 10--->0 
Then dM(a) = 0 if -a tJ- u(8M) and 
dM(a) = # { periodic solutions x on 8M with action I J)..I = -a}. 
x 
o 
0 
Since St,b)(M) = S~,b)(N) for all a < b, we conclude dM(a) = dN(a) so that the 
theorem follows. For the intricate details of the proof and for applications of this 
result, we refer to the forthcoming paper [52]. 
By computing the homology groups one also proves a conjecture by Gromov 
on the symplectic classification of open polydiscs. Define for r = (rI' r2, ... , rn ), 
where 0 < rl :S r2 :S ... :S rn , the polydisc D(r) = B2(rd x ... x B2(rn). 
Theorem 15. The open polydiscs D(r) and D(r') are symplectomorphic if and only 
if r = r', assuming rand r' are ordered. 
We recall that we have proved this statement in Chapter 2 for the special case 
n = 2. The proof was based on two symplectic invariants: the volume and a ca-
pacity. The proof for n 2: 2 follows with other applications, in [52]. The details of 
the above construction of the symplectic homology are carried out in K. Cieliebak, 

270 
CHAPTER 6 THE ARNOLD CONJECTURE, FLOER HOMOLOGY ... 
A. Floer and H. Hofer [51] where also possible extensions of this theory are out-
lined. The proof is based on the action principle in the loop space of symplectic 
manifolds and combines the construction of the dynamical capacity of Chapter 
3 and the construction of the Floer homology, with an additional real filtration. 
An alternate more recent construction of a symplectic homology theory for open 
subsets of (lR2n , wo) can be found in L. Traynor [212]; the construction is based 
on the generating function approach in a finite dimensional setting introduced in 
[218] by C. Viterbo. 
Concluding remarks. As already pointed out in the introduction we have selected 
only a few and rather elementary topics in symplectic geometry and explained 
them in detail. We would, therefore, like to mention some additional literature. 
There is a whole sequence of relative symplectic capacities for subsets in (lR2n , wo) 
in the framework of symplectic diffeomorphisms defined on all of lR2n constructed 
by I. Ekeland and H. Hofer in [68]. These capacities have an outer regularity 
property, in contrast to the intrinsically defined dynamical capacity of Chapter 
3 which has an inner regularity property. Quite recently S. Kuksin extended in 
[130] the capacity concept to some special infinite dimensional Hamiltonian sys-
tems defined by partial differential equations, e.g. nonlinear string equation on 
51, some nonlinear Schr6dinger equations on Tn. He proved, in particular, a non 
squeezing result for the flows of such systems. The construction of the capacity is 
based on a Galerkin approximation using the finite dimensional capacities intro-
duced in Chapter 3. Kuksin's result prompted a non squeezing result for a very 
special nonlinear Schr6dinger equation on 51, whose flow maps are not compact 
perturbations of linear maps in the symplectic Hilbert space, sec J. Bourgain [31]. 
Extending the embedding capacity, called the Gromov-width in Chapter 2, one 
can define, for every integer k, a new capacity as follows: one takes k symplectic 
embeddings of equal balls B(r) having disjoint images in (M,w) and determines 
an upper bound of the radius r. This leads to the symplectic packing problem 
related to algebraic geometry studied by D. McDuff and L. Polterovich in [155]; 
for interesting packing constructions we point out L. Traynor [213]. The intrin-
sic LOO-geometry on the group of compactly supported Hamiltonian mappings of 
(lR2n , wo) described in Chapter 5 has been extended to general symplectic mani-
folds by F. Lalonde and D. McDuff in [134] and [135]. It turns out that the corner 
stone of this geometry, namely the energy-capacity inequality, is equivalent to the 
non squeezing theorem. Conjugate points on geodesics in the Hofer metric have 
in the meantime been investigated by I. Ustilovsky in [214]. For a survey on these 
interesting developments we point out F. Lalonde [133]. 
As already emphasized, the V.I. Arnold conjecture about fixed points of Hamil-
tonian mappings is open for general compact symplectic manifolds of dim M 2: 8. 
For a survey on Floer's contributions to this problem we refer to D. McDuff [153] 
and to the Floer memorial volume [120]. Recently an analogue of the Arnold 
conjecture for symplectic mappings If! which are not necessarily Hamiltonian but 
isotopic to the identity through symplectic diffeomorphisms has been studied by

Le Hong Van and Kaoru Ono [137]. They prove for compact manifolds satisfying 
cll7r2(M) = '\WI7r2(M) (,\ ?: 0) assuming that all the fixed points are nondegener-
ate, that the number of fixed points of cp is at least the sum of the Betti-numbers 
of the Novikov homology over Z2 associated to the Calabi-invariant a of cp, Nov 
(a). In the special case of the torus T 2n considered in Chapter 6, Nov (a) = 0 if 
a =I- 0, so that one obtains nothing new for the torus. 
Finally, for an abundance of exciting developments and discoveries in sym-
plectic geometry not treated in our book, e.g. pseudo-holomorphic spheres, filling 
techniques, Lagrangian intersections, contact geometry, examples of symplectic 
manifolds, and so on, we refer to the forthcoming books by D. McDuff and D. Sala-
mon [156], M. Audin, J. Lafontaine [13], B. Aebischer, M. Borer, Ch. Leuenberger, 
M. Kalin, H.M. Reimann [3] and C. Abbas, H. Hofer [1]. 

Appendix 
A.1 
Generating functions of symplectic mappings in ~2n 
We shall start with the very useful observation that every symplectic map can 
locally be represented in terms of a single scalar function, a so-called generating 
function. This will be used in Appendix 2 to prove the Arnold-Jost theorem con-
cerning the construction of so-called action-angle coordinates in integrable systems. 
Such Hamiltonian systems are characterized by the property of having sufficiently 
many integrals so that, as we shall show, the task of solving (or "integrating") the 
differential equations becomes trivial, after a global symplectic transformation. 
All the considerations in section A.I are local in nature. We consider a sym-
plectic mapping u: (C'I]);--+ (x,y) in (~2n,wo) represented by 
x 
(A.I) 
y 
If we assume 
(A.2) 
det ( a~ ) of- 0, 
then, locally, the first equation in (A.I) can be solved for ~ = a(x, '1]) and inserting 
this solution into the second equation in (A.I) we find the following equivalent 
representation of the map u: 
~ 
a(x, '1]) 
y 
(3(x, '1]) , 
where (3(x, '1]) = b(a(x, '1]), '1]) and 
det(ax ) 
. det(a~) = 1. 
The advantage of scrambling the variables in this seemingly ugly manner is that 
the condition for u to be symplectic is much easier to express in terms of a and (3 
than in terms of a and b. We shall show that under the condition (A.2) the map 
u is symplectic if and only if there exists a scalar function W = W (x, '1]) with 
(A.3) 
y

:'7 W(x, '1])

Hence ({3, a) is the gradient of a function. To prove this statement we consider on 
1R4n , having the coordinates (',rJ,x,y) E 1R4n , the one-form,

d(i*a) 
i* da = cp*(j* da) 
cp*(u*wo -

If u is symplectic, that is u*wo - Wo = 0, then i*a is closed and, therefore, locally 
exact, such that

for a function W = W(x, rJ). From this identity we read off (A.3). We can reverse 
all the steps and hence have proved: 
Proposition 1. Every symplectic mapping u as in (A.I) satisfying (A.2) can locally 
be represented in the implicit form 
(A.4) 
Y 
where det(Wx1)) =I- o. Conversely, any smooth function W = W(x, rJ) satisfying 
this inequality defines implicitly by (A.4) a symplectic mapping u near a point. 
The function W(x, rJ) is called a generating function of the symplectic map u. 
The proposition shows that a symplectic map u satisfying (A.2) can locally be

described in terms of a single function. For example, the identity map corresponds 
to W(X,1]) = (x, 1]). Thus every function W, 
W(x,1]) = (x,1]) + w(x,1]) , 
w being small together with its first two derivatives, defines a symplectic mapping 
near the identity, and all such mappings can, locally, be parameterized by func-
tions. Of course, other generating functions can be constructed. If we single out 
(x,~) as independent variables, where we assume 
(A.5) 
instead of (A.2) we can represent the map u in (A.I) locally in the implicit form

with a generating function V (~, x). The proof proceeds as above, but starts with 
the one-form on ]R4n given by (J = Y dx -
1] d~, in short notation. For example, 
the identity map violates conditions (A.5) but satisfies (A.2) while the symplectic 
rotation 
x = 1], Y = -~ 
satisfies (A.5) but violates (A.2). However, for every symplectic mapping there 
is some generating function representing it, as we shall prove next. The so-called 
group of elementary symplectic transformations of (]R2n, wo) is generated by the

with a permutation 7r of the integers (1,2, ... , n). All these mappings are sym-
plectic and can be represented by symplectic matrices which we abbreviate by 
E. 
Proposition 2. Let U be a linear symplectic map of (]R2n, wo). Then there exists an 
elementary symplectic transformation E satisfying 
U·E (cA DB) and det A -1= 0 .

Lemma 1. Let A respectively B be two n x n matrices having column vectors 
aj respectively bj E ]Rn for I ::; j ::; n. Assume that the rank of the 2n x n 
matrix (A, B) is equal to r. If ABT = BAT then there are r different indices 
jp E {I, 2, ... ,n} such that there are column vectors vp = ajp or vp = bjp' which 
are linearly independent. 
Proof. The following argument is due to C. de Boor. Choose f C {I, 2, ... ,n} such 
that {aj}jEI are linearly independent and fm(A) = span{ajlj E I}. It is sufficient 
to show that 
(A.7) 
fm(B) C fm(A) + span{bs I s ~ f} . 
Pick a basis Cj of]Rn satisfying (aj, Ck) = 8jk for j, kEf. Then one computes, for 
j E f, that 
BAT Cj = bj + L dj(s)bs , 
s¢I 
where dj(s) is the s-th component of the vector AT Cj. Since fm(BAT) C fm(A), 
due to the assumption BAT = ABT, we conclude that bj,j E f, belongs to 
fm(A)+ span {bs , s ~ f} and so the claim (A.7) follows and the lemma is proved .• 
Applying Proposition 2 to a symplectic map u with Jacobian U at some point, 
we achieve the condition (A.2) to hold for u 0 E with some elementary symplectic 
transformation E and thus find a local representation in terms of a generating 
function near this point. To illustrate the use of generating functions we shall 
determine the most general symplectic map u in (A.I) for which 
(A.8) 
x = 
a(~) 
is prescribed, satisfies det(ae) -=I- 0, and is independent of "l. Representing the 
desired map u by a generating function V (~, y) in the form 
x 
Vy(~,y) 
"l 
Ve(~,Y), 
we find Vy(~, y) = a(~) and hence V(~, y) = (a(~), y) -

A.l GENERATING FUNCTIONS OF SYMPLECTIC MAPPINGS IN ]R2n 
277 
In order to generalize these considerations we first recall a definition. If (M, w) is 
any symplectic manifold, then the Poisson bracket of two functions F, G : M --> ]R 
is defined to be the function 
(A.ll) 
{F,G} = -w(Xp,Xc ) 
where X p is the Hamiltonian vector field associated to the function F. Clearly 
{F,G} = -{G,F}, and, since w(Xp,·) = -dF, we have 
(A.12) 
{F,G} = dF(Xc) = -dG(Xp). 
A symplectic map u on M, i.e., u*w = w, leaves the Poisson-bracket invariant: 
(A.13) 
{ F, G} 0 u = {F 0 u, G 0 u} . 
In order to verify this, recall the transformation formula for Hamiltonian vector 
fields, u*Xc = (dU)-lXC 0 U = XCou if u*w = w. Therefore {F,G} 0 u 
dF 0 u(Xc 0 u) = d(F 0 u)(u* Xc) = d(F 0 u)(Xcou) = {F 0 u, G 0 u} proving the 
claim (A.13). Conversely, one verifies readily that a map u satisfying (A.13) for all 
functions F and G is necessarily a symplectic map. One verifies, moreover, easily 
that for all functions F, G and H on M 
(A.14) 
[Xp, Xc] = X{C,P} 
and 
(A.15) 
{F, {G,H}} + {H, {F,G}} + {G, {H,F}} = o. 
Actually, it can be shown for a nondegenerate 2-form won M that the condition 
dw = 0 is equivalent to each of the conditions (A.14) and (A.15), see, e.g., [167]. 
Locally in a Darboux chart of M i.e., in (]R2n, wo) the Poisson-bracket of two 
functions F = F(x, y) and G = G(x, y) is expressed as 
(A.16) 
The special coordinate functions (x,y) f--+ Xj, for example, satisfy {Xi,Xj} = O. 
Hence, if u : (~,TJ) f--+ (x,y) = (a(~,y),b(~,y)) is a symplectic map we con-
clude from the invariance of the Possion brackets that {ai, aj} = 0, where Xj 
aj (~, TJ), 1 :::; j :::; n. Our aim is to prove the converse: 
Theorem 1. (Liouville) Consider n functions aj = aj(~,TJ), 1:::; j:::; n satisfying 
(i) 
{ai,aj} 
0 
(ii) 
n. 
Then there is a local symplectic diffeomeorphism u = (a, b),

= 
b(~,TJ), 
extending the relation x = a(~, TJ).

Proof. By applying an elementary symplectic transformation we may assume that 
det(a~) -# 0 and solve the equation x = a(', rJ) for, = a(x, rJ). We shall prove 
that a., is symmetric as a consequence of the condition (i). Indeed this condition 
can be written as a~a~ - a.,af = O. Multiplying this equation by ae-l from the 
left and its transpose from the right we find a~(an-l - ae-la., = 0, i.e., ae-la., is 
symmetric. On the other hand, differentiating the identity, = a( a(', rJ), rJ) yields 
n = ax a~ and 0 = ax a., + a., , 
and consequently a., = -ae-la., which is symmetric, as claimed. Therefore, locally, 
there is a function W = W(x, rJ) with 
a(x, rJ) = W.,(x, rJ) . 
Moreover, det(Wx .,) = det(ax ) = 
(deta~)-l -# 0, and hence W is a generating 
function of the desired symplectic map u extending x = a(', rJ) .• 
Corollary. If ao, at, ... an are (n + 1) functions for which 
(i) 
{aj,ad = 0, 
j,k = O,l, ... n 
(ii) 
rank (aj~,aj.,). 
= n, 
J=l,2, ... n 
then ao can be expressed as a function of al, ... an. In particular, there are at most 
n independent functions satifying (i). 
Proof. Extending the relation x = a(e, "') by the theorem, we find a symplectic 
map u for which a 0 u(x, y) = x. Now set ao 0 u = f(x, y). Since the Poisson 
bracket is preserved under u we have 0 = {aj, ao} = {x j,J} = f Yj so that f is 
independent of y. Hence ao = f(al, ... an) proving the corollary .• 
For further examples of generating functions we refer to the Notes on Dynam-
ical Systems by J. Moser and E. Zehnder [167]. We turn now to a global version 
of Liouville's theorem. 
A.2 Action-angle coordinates, the Theorem of Arnold and Jost 
We consider a symplectic manifold (M,w) of dimM = 2n. 
Definition. A Hamiltonian vector field X H on M is called integrable (in the sense 
of Liouville) if there exist n functions Fj : M ~ JR, 1 :::; j :::; n satisfying at every 
point of M: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
dFt, ... dFn 
are linearly independent 
{Fi' Fj } 
{H,Fj} 
o for all i, j . 
o for all j . 

A.2 ACTION-ANGLE COORDINATES, THE THEOREM OF ARNOLD AND JOST 279 
Introducing the map 
(A.17) 
F : M ---+ lRn , 
F(x) 
we conclude from (i) that the level sets 
(A.18) 
Nc={XEMIF(x)=c}, 
cElRn 
are n-dimensional submanifolds of M. The Hamiltonian vector fields XFj are lin-
early independent and, since dFi (X Fj ) = 0 in view of (ii), they span the tangent 
space of Nc: 
TxNc = span{XFj(x) I 1::; j ::; n} , 
x E Nc. We remark, moreover, that in view ofw(XFj,XFJ = 0 we havew(v, w) = 0 
for all pairs v, w E TxNc. Hence Nc is a Lagrangian submanifold of M. By (iii), 
the functions Fj are all integrals of X H which is therefore tangent to the level sets 
Nc so that the flow of XH leaves Nc invariant. Under an additional topological 
assumption on Nc , the flow can be determined explicitly for all times in view of the 
following theorem which goes back to V. Arnold [12] in the special case M = lR2n. 
However, Arnold required an additional assumption which was removed by R. Jost 
in [126] who proved it in the general case. 
Theorem 2. (Arnold-Jost) Let (M,w) be a symplectic manifold of dimM = 2n. 
Assume there are n functions Fj satisfying (i) and (ii) at every point. Assume, 
moreover, that one of the level sets, say N = F-I(O) c M is compact and con-
nected. Then 
1) N is an embedded n-dimensional torus Tn. 
2) There is an open neighborhood U of N in M which can be described by the 
action and angle variables (x, y) in the following manner. If x = (Xl, ... , Xn) 
are the variables on the torus Tn = lRn /7Ln and Y = (Yb"" Yn) E Db where 
Dl and D2 are some domains in lRn containing Y = 0, then there exists a 
diffeomorphism 
'lj; : rn x Dl ---+ U = U (F-1(c) n U) 
cED2 
and a diffeomorphism f.J, : D2 ---- Db with f.J,(0) = 0, such that

In particular, 'lj; maps the torus Tn X {O} diffeomorphically onto F-I(O) = N 
and the torus Tn X {y} onto Nc n U where Y = f.J,( c).

Corollary: Any integrable Hamiltonian system given by H having the integrals Pj 
is by the symplectic diffeomorphism 'ljJ transformed into the following system on 
(Tn X D1,wo): 
(A.21) 
Ho'ljJ(x,y) = h(y) , 
where the Hamiltonian h depends on the integrals only and not on the angle 
variables x. 
Proof of the Corollary: In view of (A.13) the functions Pj o'ljJ and therefore, by 
(A.20) also the coordinate functions yj, are integrals of H 0 'ljJ, and hence 
so that h(x, y) = H 0 'ljJ(x, y) does indeed not depend on the x variables .• 
Consequently, on 'ljJ-l(U) the transformed Hamiltonian system looks extremely 
simple: 
8h 
Xh : x = 8y (y), 
if = O. 
It is easily "integrated" with the solutions 
x(t) = x(O) + t~~ (y(O)) , 
y(t) = y(O) 
hence the name "integrable systems". Geometrically, every torus Tn X {y} in Tn X 
D2 is invariant under the flow 'Pt of X h and the restriction onto such a torus is 
linear: 
'Pt I Tn X {y} : (x,y) f---> (x+tw,y) 
where w = gZ (y) E ]Rn are the frequencies of this particular torus. We see that in 
the open set U c M all the solutions of x = XH(X) are quasi-periodic. 
Proof of Theorem 2. The proof proceeds in several steps. First we show that N is 
a torus. Second we introduce convenient coordinates (x, y) locally near a point p 
on N by means of Liouville's theorem. Thirdly, these coordinates are extended to 
an open neighborhood of N by means of the flows of the Hamiltonian vector fields 
X Fj . Finally, the normalization of the periods requires an additional symplectic 
change of variables to conclude the proof. 
a) In order to prove the first statement of the theorem, we denote by 'P? 
the flow of X Fj . Since [XFj , XFJ is a Hamiltonian vector field with Hamiltonian 
function {Pi, Pj } = 0, the vector fields X F j and hence also their flows do commute

wherever it is defined. Since the Fj are integrals of X Fi 
and hence cps leaves all the level sets Nc c M invariant. Fix now a point pEN. 
Then the flow cps (p) exists for all s E lRn, since N is compact, and we can define 
the action of lRn on N by 
(A.23) 
A : lRn ---* N, 
S f-+ cpS(p) . 
Clearly cps 0 cpt = cpSH. The map A is an immersion, since the tangent map at t 
maps ej E lRn onto X Fj (cpt(p)) E T<pt(p)N and hence these vectors. span the tangent 
space. Consequently, A is a local diffeomorphisms and its image is both open and 
closed and hence equal to N, since N is assumed to be connected. The map A, 
however, is not injective. The isotropy group r = {s E lRn Icps (p) = p} is a discrete 
subgroup of lRn , i.e., a lattice. Therefore r is generated by vectors 1'1, ... ,I'd E lRn 
which are linearly independent over lR and 
(A.24) 
d 
r = {I' = L nj/'j I nj E Z} . 
j=1 
In view of cps+,), (p) = cps (p) for all s E lRn, the map A induces a diffemorphism 
between lRn Ir and N. Since N and hence lRn Ir are compact, we necessarily have 
d = n so that N is an n-dimensional torus as claimed. 
. 
b) We next introduce convenient local coordinates near the point pEN. By 
the Darboux and Liouville theorems and its corollary we have 
Lemma 2. (Liouville) If (M,w) is a symplectic manifold of dimM = 2n, and if Fj 
are n functions with {Fj, Fd = 0 and dFj linearly independent everywhere, then 
every point q E M has an open neighborhood Wand a diffeomorphism 'lj; : V --> W

where (x,y) are the symplectic coordinates of (lR2n ,wo). 
Corollary. In the above "Liouville" -coordinates the flow cps defined in (A.22) looks 
very simple, namely 
(A.25) 
'lj;(X+s,y) , 
sElRn 
if (x, y) and (x + s, y) E V.

Indeed, 'Ij;-l 0 cp;j o'lj; is the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field X Pjo 1j; on V 
for every 1 :::; j :::; n. Since Fj 0 'Ij;(x, y) = Yj, it is indeed linear and given by 
(x, y) f---7 (x + sjej, y). 
c) Going back to our point pEN, we choose by Lemma 2 the Liouville co-
ordinates 'Ij; : V --+ U eM, where V is an open neighborhood of 0 in JR2n and 
'Ij;(0) = p. In order to extend these coordinates to (x, y) E JR2n we shall define a

(x, y) f---7 {)(x, y) = cpx 0 'Ij;(0, y) 
where cpx is the flow of the integrals X Pj defined in (A.22), and where D2 C JRn 
is an open (and small) neighborhood of Y = O. For small x we have, in view of 
the corollary {)(x, y) = 'Ij;(x, y), for (x, y) E V. Geometrically, the definition (A.26) 
says that we apply the flow cpx to the local section S = {'Ij;(0, y) EM: y E D 2 } 
which is, in view of the corollary, transversal to the vector fields X pj .

for y E D 2 , wherever the map is defined. If y = 0 then by 'Ij;(0,0) = p, we have 
{)(x,O) = cpX(p), and therefore by the considerations in a) the map is defined for 
all x E JRn and maps JRn X {O} onto N = F-l(O). It follows that {) is defined 
on K X D2 for a compact set K c JRn containing the lattice r in its interior 
provided D2 is small enough. We shall prove next that {) is in fact defined on all 
of JRn x D 2 . Recalling that if y = 0, then {)(x + "f, 0) = {)(x,O) for x E JRn and 
"f E r we shall first construct, for y in a small neighborhood of 0, an n-dimensional

Let r = rj E f be an arbitrary basis vector of the lattice defined in (A.24). 
Then cpT(p) = P and p = ~(O). Hence, in the Liouville coordinates V C lR2n

~(x, y) = cpT+V(Y) 0 ~(x, y) 
for (x, y) E V' C V. We can do this for every basis vector rj E f and find 
Vj(Y) = tyQj(Y) such that (A.30) holds true for rj +Vj(Y) replacing r+v(y). We, 
therefore, introduce the lattice f(y) C lRn by

a 
rj(Y) = rj + Vj(Y) = ay Wj(y) ,

Here rj E f and Wj are scalar functions satisfying Wj(O) = O. Moreover, since 
Vj(O) = 0 we have rj(O) = rj and hence 
(A.32) 
f(O) = f. 
Consequently, for small y, the lattice vectors rj(Y) are linearly independent and 
satisfy, in view of (A.30) 
(A.33)

Lemma 4. The map {J : (lRn x D2, wo) ----> (M, w) defined in (A.26) exists for all

{J(x, y),

Proof. The map {J exists for (x, y) E K X D2 with a compact set K C lRn containing 
f(O) in its interior, if D2 is small enough. Since, for x small, we have, in view of 
(A.33), 
cpX+"IJ (Y) 0 'lj;(0, y)

cpXo'lj;(O,y) = {J(x,y) 
for every 'Yj(Y) E f(y), the flow x f---7 cpx o'lj;(O, y) does indeed exist for all x E lRn by 
the standard continuation theorem of solutions of ordinary differential equations. 
It remains to prove (i). If (x, y) E lRn x D2 we choose Xo close to x such that 
(x - Xo, y) E V and represent the map {J in the form 
{J(x,y) 
cpXO+(X-XO) 0 'lj;(0, y) 
cpxo 0 'lj;(x - Xo, y) = cpxo o'lj; 0 O"xo (x, y) 
where O"xo (x, y) = (x - Xo, y) and where we have used the corollary to Lemma 2. 
Hence, {J being locally a composition of symplectic mappings is indeed symplectic 
and the lemma is proved .• 
Recall that {J(lRn X {y}) C F-1(y). We claim that, for every y E D 2 , the map 
{J induces a diffeomorphism 
(A.34) 
onto its image in F-1(y), which then is a torus Tn. We only have to prove that 
{Jo is injective provided Y is sufficiently small. Arguing by contradiction there are 
sequences (Xj, yj) and (xj, yj) satisfying 
(A.35) 
{J(Xj,Yj) = {J(xj,Yj) , Yj ----> ° 
Xj - xj tf. f(Yj) . 
Taking a subsequence we may assume Xj ----> x* and xj ----> x'*. Hence {J(x*, 0) = 
{J(x'*, 0) and, therefore x* - x'* E f(O) = f. Consequently, Xj - xj is close to a 
point in f(Yj). Since f(y) is discrete with distances between points greater than a 
positive constant uniformly in y, we conclude that Xj -xj E f(Yj). This contradicts 
(A.35) and hence proves the claim (A.34).

Recalling the definition of the lattice r(y) c lRn in (A.31) the symplectic map a

The first relation 1] = W(y) in (A.37) defines a local diffeomorphism near the fixed 
point y = o. In the statement of Theorem 2 it is denoted by p, : D2 ---+ D 1 . This 
follows since 
:y W(y) = (Yl(y), ... ,/,n(y)) 
is of rank n. Indeed the column vectors /,j(Y) are the n linearly independent gen-
erators of r(y). Hence det(Ve) =I- O. Moreover, a(ej, 1]) = (')'j(Y), y) for 1] = p,(y) 
and therefore 
a : zn X {1]} -+ r(y) x {y}, 
1] = p,(y). 
The composition 
<I> : = {) 0 a : (lRn x Dl,wo) -+ (M,w) 
is a symplectic map satisfying <I>(e + ej, 1]) = <I>(e, 1]). It induces a symplectic 
diffeomorphism 
<I> : lRn /zn x Dl -+ U c M 
which is the desired map defining the action and angle variables denoted by (e, 1]) E 
Tn xD1• Indeed, using the definitions we compute p,oFo<I>(e, 1]) = p,oFo{)oa(e, 1]) = 
p, 0 F 0 {)(x, y) = p,(y) = 1] as claimed in Theorem 2 whose proof is therefore 
completed .• 
The symplectic manifold (M, w) is not required to be exact (exact meaning that 
w = d{) for a one-form {) on M). But it follows from the theorem that the restriction 
of w onto the image U = 'ljJ(Tn x D) in M of the action-angle coordinates is an exact 
form. Indeed wlU = da for the one-form a = ('ljJ-l)* >., where>. = EJ=l yjdxj on 
Tn X D satisfies d>' = wo0 This allows us to obtain the action variables y = p, 0 F 
as "action integrals" of a over closed curves on Nc n U whose homology classes 
form a basis in Hl(Nc n U,Z) with p,(x) = y. Hence the name action variables.

ApPENDIX 
The action-angle variables (x, y) we constructed are, of course, not unique. Given a 
unimodular matrix M E GL(n,Z), a function w(y) and constants C E ]Rn, we find 
other action-angle variables (x', y') by means of the symplectic diffeomorphism of 
Tn X D: 
x' 
M ( x + ~; (y) ) 
y' 
(MT )-1 y + c. 
This corresponds to a change of the basis of the fundamental group of Tn by the 
matrix M and a phase shift ~; (y) of the action variables. Straight lines on Tn are 
mapped into straight lines under this map. 
We have constructed the action-angle coordinates near a torus and one can 
ask how these local action-angle charts fit together. We do not discuss this global 
question and refer instead to N. Nekhoroshev [168] (1972), to A.S. Mishchenko and 
A.T. Fomenko [158] (1978) and, in particular, to J.J. Duistermaat [64] (1980). In-
tegrable systems constitute a very restricted even exceptional class of Hamiltonian 
systems. Examples are described in the Notes [167], from which this appendix is 
taken with minor modifications. For interesting developments in the field of inte-
grable systems we refer to J. Moser [166].

Embeddings of Hl/2(Sl) and smoothness of the action 
In our proof of the smoothness of the action functional below the following em-
bedding properties of the space H1/2(S1) introduced in Chapter 3 will be crucial. 
Formally they follow from Sobolev's embedding theorem. However, for fractional 
derivatives a separate proof is needed. 
Theorem 3. If u E H1/2(S1) then u E LP(S1) for every 1 :::; p < 00 and there are 
constants Cp with 
The embeddings are, moreover, compact. 
Proof. It clearly suffices to find constants Cp satisfying the estimates for smooth 
functions U E coo(S1) only, since they are dense in Hl/2(S1). Assuming for sim-
plicity also the functions to have mean value zero we represent them as 
u(e27ri'!9) = L Cj e27ri'!9j with Co = 0 and Cj = cj .

Lemma 5. For 2 ::; p < 00 there are constants Cp satisfying

over the angle variable, we get 
Replacing u by v = lulp-1u, with p 2: 2, using ~~ = plulp - 1 ~~ and the Cauchy-
Schwarz inequality we find 
with a constant Cp depending on p only. Using Young's inequality (ab ::; ~ + ~ 
if ~ + ~ = 1), we conclude 
from which the lemma follows .• 
In view of this lemma, Proposition 3 is a consequence of the next proposition 
which is a special case of a more general Sobolev embedding theorem. It states 
that H 1,2(D) is continuously embedded in V(D), for every p < 00. 
Proposition 4. There are constants Cp , 2 ::; p < 00 such that 
for all u E C 1 (D). 
Proof. First extend the functions u E C1(D) to Cl-functions of compact support 
in a neighborhood of D. This may be achieved as follows. Choose X E Cg"(lR?) 
such that X = 1 on D and X = 0 outside a disc of radius ~. Then define the 
extension of u = u(r, 19) by 
1 
u(l + r, 19) = {4u(1 - "2r,19) - 3u(1 - r, 19)} . X(l + r, 19) . 

A.3 EMBEDDINGS OF Hl/2(Sl) AND SMOOTHNESS OF THE ACTION 
289 
This defines a linear extension map E : C1(D) -+ C~(Q) which is bounded in the 
W 1,2 norm, where Q is a bigger domain. In order to prove the proposition it is, 
therefore, sufficient to find constants Cp such that for all u E C~ (Q)

If u E C~(Q), then

By integration, 
Replacing u by v = lult-1u, with t ~ 2, we find by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality 
Ilullit2t(Q) 
< 
Ctllullit;;~2(Q) 11~~II£2(Q)II~~II£2(Q) 
< 
Ctllullit2-;~2(Q) IIV'ulli2(Q) . 
Hence by Young's inequality, 
(A.39) 
If t = 2, we have the W 1,2 norm on the right hand side and hence by iterating the 
inequality (A.39) the desired estimate (A.38) follows for every 2 ~ P < 00. This 
completes the proof of Proposition 4 and the first claim of Theorem 3. 
Finally we shall show that the embeddings H 1/ 2 -+ LP are compact for p < 00. 
For the special case p = 2, this is proved in Chapter 3. Applying the Cauchy-
Schwarz inequality to lui lulq- 1 = lul q , we find the following interpolation in-
equality 
Since H 1/ 2 -+ L 2q-2 is continuous by the first part of Theorem 3 and H 1/ 2 -+ L2 is 
compact, we conclude from the above interpolation inequality that also H 1/ 2 -+ Lq 
is compact. This proves the second statement of Theorem 3 .•

ApPENDIX 
The case p = 00 is excluded in Theorem 3 and we give an example of an 
unbounded function in H 1/ 2(81 ). If 0 < c < ~ then the function 
u(ew ) : = Re[log(l- ei19)]!~c 
belongs to H 1/ 2 (81), where the branch of log is chosen so that log 1 = O. In order 
to verify this it suffices, to prove for J(z) := [log(1 -
z)]!~c, that the integral 
J 1f'(zW dxdy 
Izl<l 
is finite. We would like to add that a function u E H 1/2 not only belongs to LP for

This result, due to D.E. Marshall, sharpens an estimate of A. Beurling and we 
refer to S.Y. Chang [40] and more recently W. Beckner [17]. 
Next we consider a smooth Hamiltonian H E Coo (JR X JR2n, JR) which is periodic 
in time, H(t,x) = H(t + l,x) for all (t,x) E JR X JR2n. We assume that all the 
derivatives of H have polynomial growth. 
Theorem 4. The action a : H 1/ 2 (81 ) -+ JR?, defined by 
1 
a(x) : = J H(t,x(t))dt,

belongs to Coo(H1/ 2 (81 ), JR).

Now aj(x) is a continuous j-linear form on Hl/2 which, in addition, depends con-
tinuously on x E Hl/2. This follows immediately from Holder's inequality applied 
to the above integral, using Theorem 3 and the assumption that the derivatives of 
Hare polynomially bounded. Moreover Irk(X, ~)I ~ Cd~I~N. Since this holds true 
for every k we conclude by the converse to Taylor's theorem (see e.g R. Abraham 
and J. Robbin [2]) that a is smooth and, as formally expected, has the derivatives 
for j 2: 1. The proof of Theorem 4 is finished .• 
A.4 The Cauchy-Riemann operator on the sphere 
The Cauchy-Riemann operator is the linear operator defined by 
8: COO(C, cn) ---> COO(C, cn) : U ---> Us + iUt. 
We drop for convenience the factor ~ in the usual definition of 8. Here s + it are 
the coordinates on C. Our first goal is to solve the equation 
8u=g 
for given g E V, where V denotes the vector space of compactly supported Cn _ 
valued smooth functions on C. If c > 0 and U E V we define the function Aeu : 
<e ---> <en using the Green's function of 8 by 
1 J 1 
(Aeu)(z) = -271" 
~u(z+~)dsdt, 
lel~e 
where ~ = s + it, s, t E R Since U has compact support there exists a constant 
M > 0 depending on u, such that for all Zl, Z2 E C

where R > diameter ( suppu) + max{lzll, IZ21}. The estimate implies that Aeu E 
C°«C,<en). Similarly one finds for Cl,C2 > 0 
Here 11.110 denotes the sup-norm. By the latter estimate the limit of Aeu for C -+ 0 
exists uniformly and defines a continuous function Au : <e -+ <en. 
If e E <e is a vector of unit length, h E JR \ {O} and u E D we denote by dhu 
the difference quotient associated to hand e: 
(dhU)(Z) = u(z + he) - u(z) 
h 
It follows immediately from the definition of A that 
From the definition we deduce that for every compact K C JR2n there is a constant 
M = MK such that IAeu(z)1 :::; Mllullo for all u E D having supp(u) c K. There-
fore, also IAu(z)1 :::; Mllullo. Consequently, denoting by De the directional deriva-
tive associated to the vector e, we find for fixed z, that l(dhAu)(Z) - (ADeu)(z)1 = 
IA(dhU - Deu)(z)1 :::; MildhU - Deullo -+ 0 as h -+ 0, where M depends only on 
supp(u). Hence ADe = DeA and repeating the arguments 
We see that A defines a linear map from D into Coo, satisfying, in addition, 
Ao8=8oA. 
In fact, even more is true and we claim that 
8oA= Idon D. 
In order to prove this we define v(s, t) = u(z +~) for a fixed z E <e and ~ = s + it.

denoted by i. Consider now the vector bundles 
8 2 X en 
~ 8 2 
where the fibre Xz over z E 8 2 consists of all complex anti-linear maps <p : Tz8 2 -+ 
en. In order to define the Cauchy-Riemann operator 8 on the COO-sections of these 
bundles, we denote by Coo (82 X en) the space of smooth sections of 8 2 X en -+ 8 2 , 
i.e., Coo (82 X en) = Coo (82 , en), and with Coo (X) the space of smooth sections 
of X -+ 8 2 . We define 8: COO(82 X en) -+ COO(X) by 
(A.41) 
(8f)(z) = Tu(z) +iTu(z)i, 
where Tu(z) : Tz 8 2 -+ en, z E 8 2 is the tangent map of u. Note that 
(8u)(z) 0 i = -i 0 (8u)(z) , 
so that 8 is indeed well-defined. 
We now assume that g E COO(X). Using a partition of unity subordinate to 
our distinguished atlas (A.40), we have the splitting 
g = gu + gv, 
where supp(gu) C U, supp(gv) C V. The map gu(z) : e -+ en is complex anti-
linear for every z E U = e, and has compact support with respect to z. Hence 
belongs to V. We can solve

Because 8u(z) is anti-linear we have au = gu over U = C. By Proposition 5, we 
have u(z) -+ 0 as Izl-+ 00 and, moreover, au(z) = 0 outside the support of gU so 
that u is holomorphic for Izllarge. Consider the map on V\ {oo},

This map is holomorphic in a punctured neighborhood of 0 and u( ~) ----> 0 for 
z ----> O. Hence 0 is a removable singularity by the well-known classical result in the 
theory of one complex variable. Therefore, u may be viewed as a smooth function 
on 8 2 which vanishes at 00. From Proposition 5 we conclude in particular 
Proposition 6. The map A defines a linear operator from V into the subspace 
{J E Coo (82 ,en)lf( 00) = O} of Coo (82 ,en), satisfying 
aoA = Id. 
Back to our previous discussion, we have found u E Coo (82 X en) solving 
the equation au = gu and since 8 2 \ {O} is biholomorphic to e, we find by the 
same reasoning a gv E Coo (82 X en) satisfying av = gv. Therefore, it follows that 
a( u+v) = gu + gv = 9 proving that a is surjective. On the other hand, if au = 0 we 
obtain a bounded holomorphic function u : e ----> en which by Liouville's theorem 
is a constant map. Summing up we have proved 
Theorem 5. The map a : COO(82 X en) ----> COO(X) is a surjective linear operator 
whose kernel consists of all constant maps. As a real (respectively complex) linear 
operator the kernel is of dimension 2n (respectively n). 
Next we would like to study a as an operator in a Sobolev space setting based 
on LP-spaces 1 < p < 00. We start with the following estimate from Douglis and 
Nirenberg, [63]. Denote by VI the subspace of V consisting of all functions in V 
with support in the unit ball. We write I . Ik,p for the norm defined by 
lul~,p = L ID"uliP(B1 (O))'

Here kEN and 1 < p < 00. The fundamental estimate given in [63] is the following 
Theorem 6. For given kEN and 1 < p < 00 there exists a positive constant 
c = c(k,p) satisfying 
for all u E VI. 
In order to obtain some Sobolev type estimates for the section map a: COO (82 X 
en) ----> COO(X) we take a finite covering Ul, ... , Urn of 8 2 so that Uj is biholomor-
phic to the open unit disc B around O. Let /31, ... ,/3n be a subordinate partition 
of unity. Denoting by 'Pj : Uj 
----> B suitable biholomorphic diffeomorphisms we 
define a norm 1lllk,p for kEN, 1 < p < 00, by 
It is easy to show that all the norms on COO (82 xen ) obtained by this procedure are 
equivalent. For the bundle X ----> 8 2 we take smooth complex linear trivialisations

Again all norms obtained this way are equivalent. Let us abbreviate ~j = '¢j( cpj1)

,8j(z)~j(z) [(Tuj(Z) + iTuj(Z))i)Tcpj(z)] , 
where Uj = Uj 0 cpj1. This gives immediately the estimate 
l~j(,8j(8u)(cpj1))I:,p ~ d;l,8j(:s + i:t)Ujl:,p' 
for a suitable constant dj independent of u. If d = inf { db ... , dm }, then

Theorem 7. There exist constants a, c > 0 such that for all u E Coo(82 X cn) 
Ilaullo,p ~ cllul i1,p - allullo,p . 
Define W 1,P(82 xCn ) and LP(X) as the completions of the spaces COO (82 xCn ) 
and Coo(X) with respect to the norms III iI,p and 1IIIo,p. By the compact embedding 
of W 1,p ~ LP we find in view of Theorem 7 that a : W 1,P(82 X cn) --+ £V(X) has 
closed range. Since in view of Theorem 5 the range contains the dense set Coo(X) 
we deduce a(Wl,p(82 x cn)) = £V(X) and hence a is surjective. 
On the other hand, by interior elliptic regularity theory or by the well-known 
fact that a holomorphic distribution is a holomorphic function, we conclude from 
au = 0 that u is holomorphic and bounded and consequently constant. 
We have proved 
Theorem 8. The operator a : W 1,P(82 X cn) --+ LP(X) is a surjective Fredholm 
operator whose kernel consists of the constant functions. Hence the index of a as 
a real operator is 2n. 
With some more efforts and rudimentary functional analysis one can prove 
Theorem 9. For every kEN and 1 < p < 00 there are positive constants c = c(k,p) 
and a = a(k,p) such that 
Ilaullk,p ~ cllullk+l,p - allullo,p , 
for all u E Coo(82 X cn). 
As an operator from Wk+l,P(82 xCn ) to Wk,P(X) the linear operator a is again 
a surjective Fredholm operator whose kernel consists of the constant functions. For 
a general treatment of first order elliptic systems, we refer the reader to Vekua's 
book, [215], or its English translation.

Using this estimate and the usual differential quotient technique from standard 
elliptic regularity theory we obtain the following regularity result. 
Let J be a smooth almost complex structure defined on en (or at least near 
0) such that J(O) = i. Assume

where iJi = Bi\(-c,c)i. We have the following 
Theorem 11. Under the above assumptions there exists 8 E (O,c) such that ulBt 
is smooth. 
Our next aim is to give an application to a regularity question raised in Chapter 
6. Let 
w: [-c, c] x [-c, c] ---> en 
be of class W1,p, 2 < p < 00. Assume w(O) = 0, and J is an almost complex 
structure defined on a sufficiently large neighborhood of zero such that J(O) = i. 
Assume H : [-c, c] x U ---- en is a smooth map, where U is a sufficiently large 
neighborhood of 0 in en. Moreover, let H'(O, 0) = 0, where H' is the gradient with 
respect to the second variable for some Riemannian metric on U. 
We consider the partial differential equation 
(A.42) 
aw 
aw 
I 
as + J(w)Ft + X[O,oo)(s)H (t, w) = 0 
on (-c, c) x (-c, c). Here X[O,oo) is the characteristic function of [0,(0). The amaz-
ing fact is that 
wi ([-8,0] x [-8,8]) 
and 
wi ([0,8] x [-8,8]) 

300 
ApPENDIX 
are smooth for some sufficiently small 8 E (0, c). In particular, 
w I ({ o} x [-8,8]) --+ en 
is smooth. Note that wl([-8,8] x [-8,8]) is not smooth since the derivatives in 
the s-direction do not match. The above proof of the smoothness assertion will be 
reduced by a series of transformations to Theorem II. 
For simplicity of the argument we assume that all data Hand J are defined on 
the whole of en. Define an almost complex structure j on [0, c] x [-c, c] X en x en 
by 
j(s, t, u, v)(a, b, h, k) = ( - b, a, J(u)h + bH'(t, u) + aJ(u)H'(t, u), -J(v)k) , 
The definition of j is motivated by Gromov's trick and something that one could 
call the "inverse reflection principle". It will turn out that a solution w of (A.42) 
gives a holomorphic map a on [0, c) x [-c, c) for the structure J. 
We leave it to the reader to verify that j2 = -I d. Let 
j = j(O,O,O,O). 
We observe that 
j(a,b,h,k) = ( - b,a,ih + bH'(O,O) + aiH'(O,O),-ik) . 
Define a linear real subspace of JR x JR x en x en by 
T = {(a, b, h, h,) I bE JR, hE en} . 
Clearly dimR.(T) = 2n + 1 =: N. We note that 
(A.43) 
TnjT = {O}. 
Indeed, if 
j(O, b2, h2' h2) 
( - b2, 0, ih2 + b2 H'(O, 0), -ih2) , 
we find h = b2 = ° 
implying 
and, therefore, hl = h2 = 0. Define a map a: [O,E] x [-E,E] -+ JR x JR x en x en 
by 
a(s,t) = (s,t,u(s,t),u(-s,t)). 

A.5 ELLIPTIC ESTIMATES NEAR THE BOUNDARY AND AN APPLICATION 
301 
Then 
a(O, t) = (0, t, U(O, t), U(O, t)) E T 
for t E [-e,e]. Moreover a is in W1,P([0,e] x [-e,e],]R x]R x en x en), since u, by 
assumption, belongs to this space. On (0, e) x (-e, e) we compute 
as(s, t) + j( a(s, t)) (at(s, t)) 
(1,0, us(s, t), -us( -s, t)) 
+( -1,0,J(u(s,t))Ut(s,t) + H'(t,u(s,t)),-J(u(-s,t)ut(-s,t)) 
(0,0,0,0) . 
In view of (A.43) the set T is a totally real subspace of (]R x ]R x en x en,j). It 
is a simple exercise to find a complex linear map 
mapping Tonto ]RN. Recall that N = 2n + 1. Define (3 = ~ 0 a and an almost 
complex structure J on eN by 
J(A) = ~j ( ~-l (A)) ~-l . 
We find that 
i . 
Moreover, on (O,e) x (-e,e), 
Finally, we observe that 
(3s + J((3)(3t 
~as + ~j(~-l~a)~-l~at 
~[as + j(a)at] 
0. 
(3(0, t) E ]RN 
for t E (-e, e). Applying Theorem 11 we deduce, since (3 E W1,P([0, e] x [-e, e], eN) 
and (3(i( -e, e)) C ]RN, that (3 is smooth on [0,8] x [-8,8] for some 8 E (0, e). Hence

302 
ApPENDIX 
and 
[0,6J x [-6,6J -t en : (s, t) -t u( -s, t) 
are smooth, as we wanted to prove. 
We conclude with an observation used in Chapter 6. Recall the definition of 
ST in Chapter 6 and assume w : ST -t M solves 
(A.44) 
o = 8w + X[-T,T}xS1 (H'(t, w)dt - J(u)H'(t, w)ds) . 
Taking suitable complex coordinates near a point (To, to), respectively, (-To, to) 
in ZT C ST and suitable symplectic coordinates near w(To, to), respectively, 
w( -To, to) in M, we see that (A.44) looks, in these coordinates, like (A.42). We 
deduce, in particular, since To was arbitrary, that the loops t f-> w( - T, t) and 
t f-> w(T, t) are smooth. 
A.6 The generalized similarity principle 
Let D be the closed unit disk D = {z E q Izl :s: 1}. We denote by A E 
LOO(D,LIR(en)) a mapping which associates with zED a real linear map A(z) : 
en -t en, so that the assignment z f-> A(z) is essentially bounded. Let z f-> J(z) be 
a smooth map associating with zED a complex structure on en, i.e J(z)2 = -1, 
and J(z) : en -t en is a real linear map. We consider a solution w : b -t en of 
the first order elliptic system 
(A.45) 
ow 
ow 
as + J(z)7ft + A(z)w = 0 and w(O) = 0, 
where z = s + it. We shall show that w is represented locally near 0 by a holo-
morphic map. Define Db = {z E Dlizi :s: 6}. Generalizing a result of T. Carleman 
[37J to systems we shall prove 
Theorem 12. There exist 0 < 6 < 1, a holomorphic map a : Db -t en and a 
continuous map <I> : Do -t 9l1R(en), 
<I> E n Wl,p(Do,9lIR(en)) , 
2<p<oo 
satisfying on Do, 
J(z)<I>(z) = <I>(z)i 
and 
w(z) = <I>(z)a(z) . 
It follows, in particular, that if 0 is a cluster point of zeros of the solution w, 
then it is also a cluster point of zeros of the holomorphic map a, implying a == 0 
and therefore w == 0 on Do. This was used in the proof of the Arnold conjecture 
(Lemma 2 in 6.4). 

A.6 THE GENERALIZED SIMILARITY PRINCIPLE 
303 
Proof. Reducing the local statement to a global one, the theorem will be obtained 
as a corollary of Theorem 8 in A.4. We shall view the disk D as a subset of 
C C C U {oo} = 3 2 and begin by rewriting equation (A.45). We choose a smooth 
map z f---7 \[I(z) from D into QIIR(Cn ) satisfying J(z)\[I(z) = \[I(z)i. Then we define 
v: D ----> Cn by 
w(z) = \[I(z)v(z) , 
and compute:

\[I [~~ + i ~~ + \[1-1 A \[I v + \[1-1 (aw + Jaw)v]

\[I[~~ + i~~ + Bv] 
We see that v solves on b the equation 
(A.46) 
av 
av 
as + i at + B(z)v = 0 and v(O) = 0 , 
where B E LOO(D,.eIR(Cn )). Now we represent B(z) as follows: 
where Bz(z) is complex linear and Ba(z) complex anti-linear. We denote by r : 
Cn 
----> Cn the anti-linear complex conjugation map h f---7 h, and choose C E 
LOO(D,.edCn )) in such a way that 
C(z)v(z) = v(z), zED 
where v is the given solutions of (A.46). Define E E LOO(D,Dc(Cn )) by 
E(z) = Bz(z) + Ba(z) 0 r 0 C(z) . 
Then E(z) is complex linear and 
E(z)v(z) 
B(z)v(z), zED. 
Therefore v satisfies on b,

notations introduced in Appendix 4, we consider, for 1 < p < 00, the Cauchy-
Riemann operator between sections, 

304 
ApPENDIX 
where the fibre X z , z E 8 2 of the vector bundle X ---+ 8 2 is the vector space con-
sisting of all complex anti-linear maps Tz8 2 ---+ C(Cn ). By Theorem 8 in Appendix 
4, the mapping 
G 
W 1,p( 8 2 x C(Cn )) ---+ V(X) x C(Cn ) 
G(Z) : = (az,Z(o)) , 
is a linear isomorphism if 2 < p < 00. Note that in the case 2 < P < 00 we 
can estimate the CO-norm in terms of the W 1'P-norms on 2-dimensional domains 
(Sobolev embedding theorem). If G(Z) = (O,Id) we infer that Z(z) = Id for 
z E 8 2 • Hence if a linear map D. : W 1,P(82 x C(Cn )) ---+ LP(X) is small (in the 
operator norm) then the perturbed map G/::,., defined by 
G/::,.(Z) = (az + D.(Z) , Z(O)) , 
is still an isomorphism, and Z = G-1(0, I d) is a map 8 2 ---+ Ql(Cn ) satisfying 
Z(O) = Id. If z E 8 2 we define E(z) : C(Cn ) ---+ Xz as follows. If zED we set 
E(z)(Z) = E(z) 0 Zds - i E(z) 0 Z dt , 
and if z E 8 2\D we set E(z) = O. Then 
moreover, z ~ E(z) belongs to Loo. For 0 < c < 1 we denote by Xe the character-
istic function of the closed disk De, and define D.e E C(W1,P(82 x C(Cn)), V(X)) 
by 
(D.eZ)(z) : = Xe(z)E(z) Z(z) .

define Z* : 8 2 ---+ C(Cn ) by 
(A.48) 
Z* = 0-;1 (O,Id) . 
If c > 0 is sufficiently small, then Z* (z) E Q l (Cn ) for all z E 8 2 , hence is invertible; 
moreover, Z* (0) = I d. Finally we define a : De ---+ Cn by 
v(z) = Z*(z)a(z) ,

Here 1 is the obvious tangent vector in Tz8 2 = TzC ~ C at z E Dc C 8 2 • 
Since Z*(z) is invertible if z E Dc, we conclude that the map a : Dc ----+ cn 
is holomorphic. Defining <I>(z) := w(z)Z*(z), for z E Dc, we obtain, using the 
definitions, the required representation: 
w(z) 
w(z)v(z) 
w(z)Z*(z)a(z) 
<I>(z)a(z) . 
From w(O) = 0 we deduce a(O) = O. In addition,

So far, however, the {j constructed does depend on the p chosen. In order to 
find a {j independent of p we carry out the above procedure for a fixed Po to find a 
corresponding {jo > o. Then we employ inner elliptic regularity theory in order to 
conclude that Z* belongs to Wl~':(B6Q' CIR(C)) for every p. Now we can take any 
{j < {jo and the proof of Theorem 12 is complete .• 
Related results and applications to the transversality questions involved in the 
construction of Floer homology are contained in A. Floer, H. Hofer and D. Salamon 
[87]. 
A.7 The Brouwer degree 
In the following we shall describe the so called Brouwer degree or mapping de-
gree used in Chapter 2. It serves as a qualitative criterion for the solvability of a 
nonlinear equation 
f(x) = y 

306 
ApPENDIX 
for x. This degree is an integer which "algebraically counts" the number of solu-
tions. To be more precise we consider open bounded sets U c lRn and continuous 
maps f : U ----* lRn. Given y E lRn, the triplet (j, U, y) is called admissible, if 
y r:J- f(8U). The aim is to associate with every admissible triplet an integer, de-
noted by d(j, U, y) such that the assignment 
(j, U, y) f--t d(j, U, y) 
satisfies some natural properties formulated in the following axioms. 
Axiom 1. (Solution property) 
Assume (j, U, y) is admissible. If d(j, U, y) -10 then there exists a solution x E U 
of f(x) = y. 
The equations f(x) = y and f(x) - y = 0 have the same solutions x, and we 
therefore require 
Axiom 2. (Naturality) 
If (j, U, y) is admissible, then 
d(j,U,y) = d(j-y,U,O). 
Assume (j, U, y) is admissible and V c U is an open set containing all the 
solutions, i.e, (jIU)-I(y) C V. Then (j, V, y) is also admissible and has the same 
solutions, hence we postulate: 
Axiom 3. (Excision) 
If (j, U, y) is admissible and if the open set V C U satisfies f- 1 (y) C V, then 
d(j, U, y) = d(j, V, y). 
We wish the degree to "count" the solutions and hence require an additivity 
property: 
Axiom 4. (Additivity) 
Assume (j, U, y) and (j, V, y) are admissible and Un 11 = 0. Then (clearly (j, U U 
V, y) is admissible) 
d(j, U U V, y) = d(j, U, y) + d(j, V, y) . 
The next axiom is the most important one and crucial for the applications. We 
want the solution criterion to be stable under perturbation and require that d is 
invariant under continuous deformations: 
Axiom S. (Homotopy invariance) 
Let t f--t (jt, U, y), 0 :::; t :::; 1 be an admissible deformation, i.e, f : [0, 1] x U ----* lRn 
is continuous and (it, U, y) is admissible for every 0 :::; t :::; 1. Then 
d(jo, U, y) = d(h, U, y) . 
Finally, we normalize using a simple model equation. 

A.7 THE BROUWER DEGREE 
307 
Axiom 6. (Normalization) 
where Bl (0) is the open unit ball centered at the origin 0 in JRn. 
For the moment, let us assume that such a d, satisfying these axioms exists. 
We prove that the axioms uniquely determine d. It is called the Brouwer degree 
or mapping degree. 
Assume first, that U is open and 0 ~ U. Then (1 d, U,O) is admissible. Since 
there is no solution of 1 d( x) = 0 in U we conclude that d( 1 d, U, 0) = 0 in view of 
Axiom 1. Next we consider the linear map 1= T E QZ(JRn). 
Lemma 6. Assume U is a bounded open neighborhood of 0 and T E QZ(JRn). Then 
d(T, U,O) = sign det(T). 
Proof. Recall that QZ(JRn) = G+ u G- where G± = {T E QZ(JRn)I ± det(T) > O}; 
G+ and G- are pathwise connected. Define 'l9±1 E QZ(JRn) by 
'l9±1 = 
diag (±1, 1, ... , 1) . 
Then 'l9+ E G+ and 'l9_ E G-. Put € = sig det (T) and choose a continuous path 
t --+ Tt in Ge connecting To = 'lge with Tl = T. Then t t-t (Tt, U,O) is an admissible 
deformation and we obtain by Axiom 5 
d('lge ,U,O) = d(T,U,O). 
Since 0 is the unique solution we find by applying the excision Axiom twice that 
d(T, U,O) = d('lge , U,O) = d('lge , B1(0), 0). If € = 1 we employ Axiom 6 to find 
d(T, U,O) 
d(Id,B1(0),0) = 1 
sign det(T) . 
In order to deal with the case € = -1, we define 'PT : [-1,1] --+ JR by 'PT(t) 
Itl- ! + T, for all 0::::; T ::::; 1 and introduce IT: [-1,1] x B~-l(O) --+ JRn by 
IT (XI, ... ,Xn) = ('PT(Xl), X2, ... 'Xn) . 
Then (In (-1,1) x B~-l(O), 0) is an admissible homotopy. If T = 1 the equation 
JI(X) = 0 
has no solutions in the associated open set. Hence by Axiom 5 

308 
ApPENDIX 
for every T E [0,1]. If T = 0, then the equations IXII- ~ = 0, Xj = ° for 2 :S j :S n,

) 
x+ -
2,0, ... ,0 
where x_ E V_:= (-~,-i)xBn-1 andx+ E V+:= (i,~)xBn-l. Consequently, 
by excision and additivity we obtain 
For x E V_ we have fo(x) = (-Xl -
~,X2, ... ,Xn) and for x E V+ we have 
fo(x) = (Xl -
~,X2' ... ' xn), hence the previous equation is written 
and by excision, 
Using the homotopy invariance we can get rid of the term x_ to obtain 
° 
d('1L,Bn,O) + d('!9+,Bn,O) 
d('!9_, Bn,O) + 1. 
We deduce, that also for E = -1, 
d(T, U,O) 
sign det(T), 
and the proof of Lemma 6 is complete .• 
Assume now that (1, Bc(xo), 0) is admissible for some E > 0. Assume, in addi-
tion that f is differentiable and satisfies 
Lemma 7. 
d(!,Bc(XO),O) = 
sign det (f'(xo)) . 
Proof. Define ft(x) := tf(x) + (l-t)f'(xo)(x -xo). Since f'(xo) E Ql(JRn) we find 
a small ° < 8 :S E such that ft(x) #-° 
if Ixl = 8, for all ° 
:S t:S 1. Using excision 
and homotopy invariance we conclude that 
d(f, Bc(xo), 0) = d(f, B 15(xo), 0) 
d(f'(xo)(x - xo), B 15(xo), 0) 
d(f'(xo)(x - xo), BR(O), 0) , 

A.7 THE BROUWER DEGREE 
309 
where R > ° is so large, that B6(XO) C BR(O). Choosing R large enough we now 
get rid of the term - f'(xo)xo through an admissible homotopy and obtain 
But by excision the right hand side does not depend on the size of R; in view of 
Lemma 6, the proof of Lemma 7 is therefore complete .• 
Now we appeal to two classical results in differential topology. 
Lemma 8. Let n c ]Rn be a bounded open domain and I : n ----) ]Rn a continuous 
map. Given c > ° 
there exists a smooth map 9 : n ----) ]Rn satisfying 
I/(x) - g(x)1 < c for x En. 
Proof. In view of the classical Stone-Weierstrass theorem we can take for 9 a 
polynomial approximation of I .• 
The second result we need is a version of the Morse-Sard theorem. Recall that 
Y E]Rn is a regular value for I if f'(x) E gt(]Rn) for all x E 1-1(y). 
Lemma 9. Let U c ]Rn be open and I : U ----) ]Rn a smooth map. Then the set of 
regular values for I is residual in ]Rn and therefore dense. 
A proof can be found in the book on differential topology by M. Hirsch [113]. 
If (f, u, y) is an admissible pair we define 
0" : = 
inf I/(x) - yl , 
xE8U 
then 0" > 0, and by Lemma 8 we can pick 9 smooth with I/(x) - g(x)1 < c 
on U, where c < 0"/2. Then It = (1 - t)1 + tg defines an admissible homotopy 
t I--> (ft, U, y). Hence by Axiom 5 and Axiom 2 
d(f,U,y) = d(g,U,y) = d(g-y,U,O). 
For every z E BE(y) the homotopy t I--> gt := 9 - Y + tz is admissible for (U, 0) and 
hence 
d(f, u, y) = d(g - z, U,O) , 
for every z E BE(y). In view of Lemma 4 we can pick Zo E BE(y) which is a regular 
value of g. Hence 
d(f, u, y) = d(g, U, zo) . 
Since (J is compact and Zo regular, the set g-1 = {Xl, X2, ... ,xd is finite. By 
excision and additivity we, therefore, find for T > ° 
sufficiently small, that 
k 
d(f,U,y) 
= j'f1 d(g,BT(xj),zo) 
k J;1 d(g-zO,BT(xj),O) 
k j'f1 sign det (g' (Xj)) ,

where we have used Lemma 7. Summarizing, under the assumption that a degree 
d satisfying the Axioms 1-6 exists we conclude 
Proposition 7. 
(i) Assume (f, U, y) is admissible, f is smooth and y a regular value. Then 
d(f,U,y) = L 
sign det (!'(x)) . 
xEf-l(y) 
(ii) If (f,U,y) is admissible, then there exists an admissible (g,U,y) homotopic 
to (f, U, y), where 9 is smooth and y is a regular value for g. In particular, 
d(f, U, y) = L 
sign det (g'(x)) . 
xEg- 1(y) 
Proposition 7 shows that the degree d is uniquely determined by the Axioms 
1-6, and we shall establish its existence. The usual approach is to start with the 
formula (i) as the definition of d(f, U, y) if f is smooth with regular value y. The 
degree d(f, U, y) of a general admissible triplet is then defined as d(g, U, y) for a 
smooth 9 close to f having the regular value y. Then one verifies the axioms. The 
crucial step is to verify at first that this definition is independent of the choice 
of the approximation g. The argument is as follows. If go and gl are two smooth 
approximations of f one defines the admissible deformation G : [0, 1] x U -> ]Rn 
by G(t,x) = (1- t)go(x) +tgl(X). One can assume y to be a regular value for all 
three maps g1,g2 and G. Since G is admissible, G-l(y) C [0,1] x U, and since y 
is a regular value of G, the solution set G(t,x) = y is either empty or consists of 
finitely many disjoint, compact, connected I-dimensional manifolds. According to 
the classification of I-dimensional manifolds, see J. Milnor [157], each component 
is either a circle (if it has no boundary) or a closed interval in which case its two 
boundaries· belong to the faces {O} x U, {I} x U as illustrated in the following

If the boundaries of a component belong to the same face, the corresponding 
solutions do not contribute to the degree in view of the orientation; also, a cir-
cle does not meet the boundary and hence does not contribute. Closed intervals 
connecting one face with the other one do contribute and, indeed, by the same 
amount again in view of the orientation, hence

We do not carry out the details of this argument, and refer to H. Amann [5] or 
J. Milnor [157]. We shall establish the existence of the degree by an algebraic 
approach using homology theory. 
In order to define the degree of an admissible triplet (j, U, y) we recall that 
U c jRn is open and bounded, J : (j ---+ jRn continuous and y tJ. JUJU). Viewing 
the sphere sn as the I-point compactification of jRn, i.e., sn = jRn U {CXl}, we 
now consider J as a continuous map of the sphere, defined on (j C sn. Denote by 
UC = sn\u the complement of U in sn. Observing that sn\{y} is homeomorphic 
to jRn (e.g., by means of the stereographic projection) we consider the diagram 
By the Tietze extension theorem we can extend the map so (j18U) to a con-
tinuous map j : U C ---+ jRn. Since jRn is convex, all such extensions are homotopic. 
Define now the continuous extension F of JI8U by F := s-l 0 j : U C ---+ sn\{y}. 
Then any two such extensions of JI8U are homotopic with boundary values fixed. 
Finally, we define the continuous map F : sn ---+ sn extending J : U C sn ---+ sn 
by 
{ J(x) 
F(x) : = 
F(x) 
if 
x E U 
if 
x E UC . 
The homotopy class of F is independent of the choices involved in the construction. 
Considering the homology of sn with Z coefficients we know that Hn(sn) = Z. 
Pick any generator of Hn(sn), say Osn. Then there exists an integer d(F) E Z 
defined by 
F*Osn = d(F)osn . 
This integer is the homological degree of F : sn ---+ sn, and we now define 
d(j,U,y): = d(F) E Z. 

312 
ApPENDIX 
Since the homotopy class of F only depends on (f, U, y) and not on the choices 
involved, this integer is well-defined and we shall verify that d(f, U, y) meets the 
Axioms 1-6, by using homology theory. 
Axiom 1: Assume d(f, U, y) -I- O. Then F is surjective, because otherwise its image 
would be in a subset homeomorphic to JRn; hence F would be homotopic to a 
constant map so that d(F) = O. By construction y tj. F(UC) and therefore y E 
F(U) = f(U) implying Axiom l. 
Axiom 2: The maps F associated with (f, U, y) and G associated with (f - y, U,O) 
are homotopic implying Axiom 2 by the homotopy axiom of homology. 
Axiom 3: If F belongs to (f, U, y) then FIV = flV and y E F(VC) implying 
Axiom 3. 
Axiom 6: For the triplet (Id,B2n(1), 0) we can take F = Id: sn -+ sn and hence 
conclude d(I dsn) = 1 as desired. 
Axiom 5: Let (ft, U, y), 0 :::; t :::; 1 be an admissible homotopy. Then we can con-
struct an associated family Ft depending continuously on t. Hence t f-+ d(Ft) is 
constant by the homotopy invariance of the homology implying the assertion. 
We conclude, in particular, that d(f, U, y) only depends on f18U. Indeed if 
f : U -+ JRn and g : U -+ JRn agree on the boundary: fl8U = gl8U then tf(x)+(l-
t)g(x), 0 :::; t :::; 1 defines an admissible homotopy implying d(f, U, y) = d(g, U, y). 
Axiom 4: Consider first any admissible triplet (f, U, y) with associated map F on 
sn. Then we have the following commutative diagram (assuming n > 0), with 
s=sn 
Hn(S)

Hn(S,S\f- 1(y)) ~ 
Hn(U,U\f- 1(y))

The maps j* and k* are isomorphisms: the first one by the excision property of 
homology and the second one as a consequence of the long exact sequence for the 
pair (S, S\ {y} ). Hence we have 
(A.49) 
In order now to prove Axiom 4 we assume that U = U1 U U2 with U1 n U2 = 0 so 
that fj = flUj, j = 1,2 give admissible triplets (h,Uj,y). We have to prove that 
d(f, U, y) = d(h, U1 , y) + d(h, U2, y). We shall show that 
(A.50) 

A.7 THE BROUWER DEGREE

This implies in view of (A.49) that d(F)os = d(Fl)OS + d(F2)Os as desired. In 
order to prove (A. 50) we consider the commutative diagram

Here the maps j* and jh (f) j2* are isomorphisms by the excision in homology. 
The map D. : {3 f-t ({3, (3) is the diagonal map. Moreover, a( 0") = (ah (0"), a2* (0")) 
and b(O"l' 0"2) = bh(O"l) + b2*(0"2) where aj : (S, S\F-1(y)) ~ (S, S\fj-1(y)) and 
bj : (Uj, Uj\fj-1(y)) ~ (U, U\f-l(y)). Note that f 0 bj = fJ for j = 1,2. If 
(3 E Hn(S) we can therefore compute

f* (bhj1..1ih ({3) + b2*j2}i2~ ({3)) 
fhj1..1ih ({3) + h*j:;:.li2* ({3) 
as claimed in (A.50). We have verified that Axiom 4 holds. To sum up: we have 
demonstrated that d meets all the axioms, hence the existence proof of the mapping 
degree is complete. 
Remarks: The Brouwer degree can be extended to arbitrary normed vector spaces 
E however, for a restricted class of continuous maps only. We call a triplet (j, n, y) 
admissible, if neE is a bounded open subset, f : 0 ~ E is a continuous map of 
the form f = id - k with a compact map k (i.e., the closure of k(O) is compact in 
E), and y E E is a point satisfying y ¢:. J(an). There is a unique map associating 
to every admissible triplet an integer d(j, n, y) E Z satisfying the Axioms 1-6. It 
is called the Leray-Schauder degree; we made use of this degree in Chapter 3 in 
order to establish the existence of the symplectic capacity co. 
The crucial observation in constructing this extension is the fact, that a com-
pact map can be approximated (in the uniform topology) by compact mappings 

314

having their image in finite dimensional subspaces of E. Take such a map k satis-
fying k(O) C En C E, where dim En = n. If X E E is a solution of 
(id - k)( x) = 0, 
then x E En and hence one defines 
d(id-k,n,O) = d(id-k,nnEn'O) , 
where, on the right hand side, we have the Brouwer degree. This is well-defined. 
Indeed choosing a larger finite dimensional space Em :::> En then d(id - k, n n 
En,O) = d(id - k, n n Em, 0). This follows by approximating (id - k)ln n Em 
by a smooth map having 0 as a regular value and simply computing the index 
using the representation (i) of Proposition 1. Since the finite dimensional maps 
are dense in the set of compact maps (in the uniform topology) the continuous 
map (id - k, n, 0) ---+ d(id - k, n, 0) E Z defined above has a unique extension, 
called the Leray-Schauder degree. For the details we refer the reader to H. Amann 
[5], K. Deimling [60] and E. Zeidler [232]' Chapter 12. 
A.8 Continuity property of the Alexander-Spanier cohomology 
The mathematical tools needed for Chapter 6 are becoming more sophisticated. 
In particular, homology and cohomology theory is being used. Besides the basic 
properties of a (co-) homology theory the reader needs to know cup products and 
Poincare duality. All this can be found in standard texts on algebraic topology. 
We suggest, for example, the book by J. Vick [216], which describes the standard 
material with great care and also offers an introduction to fixed point theory intro-
ducing the fixed point index closely related to degree theory. More comprehensive 
treatments on algebraic topology are the books by A. Dold [62], W.S. Massey 
[148, 149, 150], E. Spanier [203] and R. Switzer [209]. In particular the appendix 
in [62] concerned with the Kan- and Cech-extension of homotopy invariant func-
tors is interesting for the following discussion of continuity properties of homotopy 
invariant functors. 
Nonlinear analysis is -
somewhat exaggerated -
the study of nonlinear equa-
tions of the form 
F(x) = y. 
If the map F : X ---+ Y and the topological spaces X and Y have some nice prop-
erties, for example, there is some compactness and the solution set is generically 
discrete, degree theory is a very powerful tool. Sometimes, however, the solution 
sets are generically expected to be manifolds and one would like, of course, to know 
what they are. This is in general a difficult task. But, one can try to compute some 
of their invariants, using, for example, homology theories. A situation which then 
occurs quite frequently is the following. If we consider the equation F(x) = y we 

A.8 CONTINUITY PROPERTY OF THE ALEXANDER-SPANIER COHOMOLOGY 315 
do not know whether F is generic so that the solution set might be quite badly 
behaved, for example, it might not be a manifold. On the other hand, it might be 
possible to approximate the solution set F- 1(y) by solution sets F- 1(Yk) which are 
generic, for example, manifolds. In this situation it is sometimes only possible to 
study F- 1(Yk) by algebraic means (using homology theory) and the question then 
is: under which circumstances are we able to conclude something about F- 1(y)? 
The important tool will be a continuity property for the homology theory, 
which we discuss in the following. We begin with an abstract discussion which is 
applicable in many circumstances and focus on the particular theory we need in 
Chapter 6, namely the Alexander-Spanier cohomology theory, see E. Spanier [203]. 
Let X be a topological space and C the category of all subspaces, the morphisms 
'P : A ----+ B being the continuous maps. Let A be an algebraic category. We consider 
one of the following cases: A is the category of Abelian groups, or the category 
of commutative rings, or the category of modules over a fixed ring. Assume a 
contravariant functor h : C ----+ A is given, i.e., to every A E C we associate an 
algebraic object h(A) E A and to a continuous map 'P : A ----+ B a homomorphism 
'P* = h('P) : h(B) ----+ h(A). If A c B we have a natural inclusion map and we 
denote by iAB : h(B) ----+ h(A) the induced map. Since h is a contravariant functor 
we have 
iAC for A c Bee 
Idh(A) . 
Given A c X we denote by V A the collection of all open neighborhoods of A. 
We denote for U E V A the homomorphism induced by the inclusion A C U by 
iu : h(U) ----+ h(A). 
Definition 1. Let h be as described above and A C X fixed. We call h continuous 
at A if the following conditions hold 
(i) Given a E h(A) there exist U E VA and au E h(U) such that iu(au) = a 
(ii) Given au E h(U), with U E VA satisfying iu(au) = 0, there exists V E VA 
satisfying A eVe U and ivu(au) = o. 
In other words any element a E h(A) lives already on a neighborhood of A and any 
class a E h(U), U EVA which "dies" on A, "dies" already on some neighborhood. 
As we shall see in the following we can reconstruct h(A) from the h(U), U EVA 
provided h is continuous at A. 
Observe that V A is a directed set in the following sense. We can define an order 
structure :S by 
U :S V :<===} U J V 
("smaller sets are larger"). Moreover given U, V E V A there exists W E V A 
satisfying 
W~U,W~V. 

316 
ApPENDIX 
Indeed, just take W = Un V. Hence we have the following structure. For U:::; V 
we have a homomorphism 
ivu : h(U) ---> h(V) 
and for every U E 0 A a homomorphism 
iu : h(U) ---> h(A) . 
Moreover, the following holds: If U :::; V :::; W then 
iwvivu = iwu and iuu = I d . 
Moreover, if U :::; V, then 
ivivu 
iu . 
We first carry out a construction called the direct limit and then show that it is 
isomorphic to h(A) provided h is continuous at A. 
Define MA E A as the direct sum 
MA = EB 
h(U). 
UEO(A) 
If A consists of abelian groups, MA will be an abelian group, etc. Denote by 'Pu 
the homomorphism 
'Pu : h(U) ---> MA , 
which is the inclusion into the U-th factor. 
Consider the subgroup, subring or submodule KA generated by elements of the 
form 
'Pu(au) - 'Pvivu(au) 
where U, V E 0 A satisfy U :::; V and where au E h(U). Define LA by 
Depending on A this quotient is either an Abelian group, or a commutative ring 
or a module. 
Elements of LA are equivalence classes [(au)] where (au) E MA with au = 0

av E h(V). For an element (au) E MA we consider the element ~(( au)) .-
LUEOA iu(au) E h(A). We note that the sum is finite. For the element

Clearly ~ : MA ~ h(A) defines a homomorphism. By the preceding discussion its

In a precise sense <I> gives us what the h(U), U E 0 A, know about the h(A). The 
above construction is the well-known direct limit denoted by 
h(A) := LA = dir lim h(U).

It is an algebraic measure of what the neighborhoods of A know about A with 
respect to the contravariant functor h. 
Theorem 13. Assume h is continuous at A. Then

Proof. Assume <I>(a) = O. We can represent a E h(A) by an element <pv(av) for 
V ~ Ua where av E h(V) by the preceding discussion. Hence

theory. We refer the reader to the original articles by E. Spanier [202]' the book 
by E. Spanier [203] and the excellent book by W.S. Massey [149]. 
Definition 2. (see also [202]) Let X be a topological space and A a subspace. We 
say A is taut in X if for every coefficient ring R the Alexander-Spanier cohomology 
functors fIi(., R), for every i, are continuous at A. 
The following very useful theorem is due to E. Spanier and we refer the reader 
to [204] 
Theorem 15. In each of the following cases A is taut in X 
(i) 
A is compact and X is Hausdorff. 
(ii) 
A is closed and X is paracompact and Hausdorff. 
(iii) A is arbitrary and every open set in X is paracompact and Hausdorff. 
(iv) A is a neighborhood retract. 
So we note that in a metrizable space every subset A is taut, and hence, by 
Theorem 13, 
fI*(A) ~ dir lim fI*(U).

This series presents, at an advanced level, introductions to some of the fields of cur-
rent interest in mathematics. Starting with basic concepts, fundamental results and 
techniques are covered, and important applications and new developments dis-
cussed. The textbooks are suitable as an introduction for students and non-spe-
cialists, and they can also be used as background material for advanced courses and 
seminars. 
We encourage preparation of manuscripts in TeX for delivery in camera-ready copy 
which leads to rapid publication, or in electronic form for interfacing with laser 
printers or typesetters. Proposals should be sent directly to the editors or to:

The foundations of this outstanding book series were laid in 1944. Until the end of 
the 1970s, a total of 77 volumes appeared, including works of such distinguished 
mathematicians as Caratheodory, Nevanlinna and Shafarevich, to name a few. The series 
came to its name and present appearance in the 1980s. According to its well-established 
tradition, only monographs of excellent quality will be published in this colledion. Com-
prehensive, in-depth treatments of areas of current Interest are presented to a readership 
ranging from graduate students to profeSSional mathematiCians. Concrete examples and 
applications both within and beyond the Immediate domain of mathematics illustrate the 
import and consequences of the theory under discussion.
