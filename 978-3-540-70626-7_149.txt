Probability in Quantum Mechanics
Probability in Quantum Mechanics
Abner Shimony
The concept of probability played an important role in the very beginning of  quan-
tum theory, when Max Planck (1858–1947) postulated the discrete emission and
absorption of radiation in a  black body radiation. The quantum statistical me-
chanics developed by Planck and his successors has extraordinary consequences
treated elsewhere in this Compendium. Here, however, the emphasis will be upon
the unprecedented role of probability in the quantum mechanical treatment of the
state of a physical system, which will be discussed ﬁrst in the  wave mechanical
formulation of Schr¨odinger, and then in the more abstract and general  Hilbert
space formulation.
The thesis of Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) of 1924 [1] postulated that waves
are associated with  electrons and that a discrete atomic state is determined by the
occurrence of an integral number of wave lengths in a circular trajectory about the
atomic nucleus. Erwin Schr¨odinger (1887–1961) [2] systematized and generalized
de Broglie’s idea in the ﬁrst of his series of papers on  wave mechanics.
Schr¨odinger assumed that the wave associated with a system of electrons is a
complex-valued function ψ whose argument r = (r1, . . . , rN) is positioned in an
N-dimensional conﬁguration space R (N = 3 in the case of a single electron). If the
 state ψ of the system of electrons is stationary with energy E, then ψ was assumed
to satisfy the time-independent differential equation

n (2mn)−1(−iℏ∂/∂rn)2 + V (r1, . . . , rN)

ψ(r) = = Eψ,
(1)
where V is the potential energy as a function of position in conﬁguration space.
In later papers in the series Schr¨odinger [3] wrote a time-dependent equation for
ψ (r, t), explored analogies to Hamilton’s comparison of appropriately formu-
lated classical mechanics and optics, and developed methods for solving his wave
mechanical equations. He also examined [4] the conceptual relations between his
wave mechanics and Heisenberg’s [5] formulation of quantum mechanics ( matrix
formulation).
The fourth of Schr¨odinger’s pioneering papers [6] on wave mechanics suggested
that ψ∗ψ be interpreted as a “weight function” of a charge distribution. In particular,
if ψ is the wave associated with an electron, then e[ψ(r)]∗ψ (r), where e is the elec-
tric charge of the electron, was interpreted as the electron’s charge density at r. But
this interpretation was difﬁcult to reconcile with the evidence for the indivisibility of
the electron and the quantum mechanical predictions of the spatial spreading of an
unbound electron. In a quantum mechanical analysis of collision phenomena Max
Born (1882–1970) [7] proposed an alternative interpretation of the wave function
which was almost universally accepted: that [ψ(r)]∗ψ (r)dr is the probability that
the system be found in the inﬁnitesimal region dr about r; in other words [ψ(r)]∗ψ

(r) is a probability density of position in conﬁguration space. To ensure that the
probability of ﬁnding the system anywhere in conﬁguration space is unity, which is
the conventional representation of certainty in probability theory, it sufﬁces to mul-
tiply ψ(r) by a scalar independent of r such that the integral of this density over R
is unity.
Various pioneers, among them London [8] and Dirac [9], gave prescriptions for
extracting information about the probability distributions of other quantities than
position from the wave function ψ. Typically in their prescriptions ψ is expanded in
a complete orthonormal set of functions φn(r), each square integrable over R,
ψ(r) =

n cnφn(r),

n |cn|2 = 1
(2)
where

R
[φn(r)]∗φm(r)dr = δmn(orthonormality)
(3a)
and
Aφn(r) = anφn(r),
(3b)
with A a self-adjoint linear operator on function space. Physically A represents an
observable quantity A, the eigenvalues an being the values of A in the physical states
represented respectively by the φn(r). The physical interpretation of the expansion
(2) is that the probability of ﬁnding the quantity A to have value a when the particle
is prepared in the state represented by ψ is
Probψ(A = a) = %′|cn||2, with the sum %′ taken over all n such that
an = a.
(4)
Lacking in the foregoing generalized probabilistic interpretation of the  wave
function is the procedure for associating self-adjoint linear operators A with phys-
ical quantities A. The pioneers treated this problem by an intuitive combination of
analogies to classical mechanics with Heisenberg’s analysis of the relation of mo-
mentum to position. A rigorous treatment, notably by George Whitelaw Mackey
(1916–2006) [10], applies the theory of induced representations of groups.
Although Schr¨odinger’s expression of the quantum mechanical state as a function
of position in conﬁguration space – the wave function – was extraordinarily valuable
both intuitively and practically, it lacked mathematical generality and rigor. A series
of investigations by David Hilbert, Lothar Nordheim, and John von Neumann [11],
most notably the last [12], used the theory of Hilbert space to achieve a more general
and more abstract formulation of quantum mechanics than Schr¨odinger’s.
A Hilbert space is a vector space endowed with an inner product (for quantum
mechanical purposes usually taken to be complex), with a norm, and complete in
this norm. A vector space is a set of elements closed under the operation of vector
addition + and multiplication of vectors by scalars, which are elements of a ﬁeld
F, and with standard behavior of the null vector 0 and of the scalars 0 and 1. (In
standard quantum mechanics F is taken to be the set C of complex numbers.) A

complex inner product on the vector space V is a mapping of ordered pairs φ, χ of
vectors in V into C, denoted by ⟨φ|χ⟩, satisfying the following conditions:
1. ⟨φ|φ⟩⩾0 and equals 0 only if φ = 0
2. ⟨φ|χ⟩= ⟨χ|φ⟩∗, where ∗represents complex conjugation.
3. ⟨φ|χ⟩= a.⟨φ|χ⟩for any scalar a.
4. ⟨φ|χ + σ⟩= ⟨φ|χ⟩+ ⟨φ|σ⟩.
A norm on V is introduced without further postulation by the deﬁnition
φ →||φ|| = |⟨φ |φ⟩|1/2.
(5)
A Cauchy sequence in V relative to this norm is a sequence {φn} with the property
that for any positive ε there is an integer M such that
||φn −φm|| < ε
(6)
for n and m greater than M. The space V is complete if every Cauchy sequence φn
converges in the norm to some vector φ in V. In common applications of quantum
mechanics the Hilbert space associated with a system is assumed to be separable,
that is, to have a denumerable basis from which a sequence can be constructed by
addition and scalar multiplication to converge in the norm to any given vector in V.
An idealized but illuminating bridge between the quantum mechanical view of
physical systems and the Hilbert space formulation is the concept of a “logic of
questions”, discussed by various authors including Birkhoff and von Neumann [13],
Piron [14], Mackey [15], and Varadarajan [16]. A physical system can be charac-
terized by systematically answering yes-no questions about its properties, whose
answers assert or deny attributions to the system. According to empiricist science
the answers to these questions are determined by measurements, but the entire set
of questions can be endowed with a rigorous structure only if the measurements are
ideally accurate and error free. The idealized set of questions, which will be called
the logic of questions, is assumed to be a complete orthocomplemented lattice.
A lattice L is (1) a partially ordered set of elements: i.e., there is a binary rela-
tion such that for all elements q < r and r < q imply q = r; q < r and r < s
imply q < s; and q < q; (2) there is unique element 0 such that 0 < q for all ele-
ments q, and a unique element 1 such that q < 0 for all q; and (3) for any nonempty
ﬁnite subset F of L there exist in L a unique least upper bound and a unique greatest
lower bound of F with respect to the ordering relation <, denoted by ∨qεF and ∧qεF
respectively. L is orthocomplemented if there is a one-one mapping q →q⊥such
that q⊥⊥= q, q < r implies r⊥< q⊥, the least upper bound of q and q⊥is 1,
and the greatest lower bound of q and q⊥is 1. A lattice is complete if the restriction
of ﬁniteness of F in condition (3) is replaced by denumerable inﬁnity. When the
abstract structure of a complete orthocomplemented lattice is applied to the logic
of questions the element 1 is interpreted as the question whose answer is necessar-
ily ‘yes’ and the element 0 is interpreted as the question whose answer is necessarily
‘no’; the orthocomplementation operation generates from the question q the ques-

tion q⊥whose answer under any circumstances is the opposite of the answer to q in
the same circumstances.
With these preliminaries, the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics
(if one sets aside simpliﬁcations like particles of ﬁnite spin whose properties in
conﬁguration space are deliberately neglected) can be compactly formulated: (I) the
logic of questions of a quantum mechanical system is isomorphic to the lattice of
closed linear subspaces of a Hilbert space H [17].
Equivalently, the logic of questions is isomorphic to the lattice of projection oper-
ators on H, where P is a projection operator if it is a linear operator on H, self-adjoint
in the sense that for all pairs of vectors φ, χ ⟨φ|Pχ⟩= ⟨Pφ|χ⟩, and idempotent in the
sense that P 2 = P.
The formulation can be strengthened by inserting the adjectives “separable
inﬁnite-dimensional” before “Hilbert space” for all cases in which the system is
explicitly located in a conﬁguration space, omitting these adjectives only when the
 spin aspects of the system are studied as a convenient simpliﬁcation in abstraction
from conﬁguration aspects.
It should be noted that the explicit construction of the isomorphism asserted in
Axiom (I) is mathematically intricate, using the theory of induced representations
of groups (see Mackey [10]), as indicated in the paragraph after Eq. (4).
In usual textbook expositions of quantum mechanics there is not only an ax-
iom relating the logic of questions to the lattice of projections on the Hilbert space
but another axiom giving a Hilbert space characterization of the states which as-
sign probabilities to the questions: it is assumed that a pure state S (later to be
contrasted with a  mixed state) is represented many-one by non-null vectors in
the Hilbert space H, or more elegantly one-one by a one-dimensional subspace
E(φ) = {φ}, which consists of all scalar multiples of an arbitrary non-null vec-
tor φ associated with the state. Then (II) the probability that question Q has answer
‘yes’ when the state is represented by φ, or equivalently by the one-dimensional sub-
space E{φ), is ⟨φ|Q|φ⟩/⟨φ|φ⟩, where Q is the projection operator associated with
the question Q; and of course this expression is simpliﬁed when φ has norm unity.
A remarkable theorem of Andrew Mattei Gleason (*1921) ( Gleason’s theo-
rem) [18] shows that assumption (II) of the preceding paragraph is almost superﬂu-
ous. If the Hilbert space has dimension greater than 2, then the only states S in the
sense of probability measures on the lattice of questions which satisfy the standard
axioms of probability – non-negativity, ascription of probability unity to the iden-
tity operator I, and additivity of the probability assigned to the least upper bound of
mutually orthogonal questions – have the form
Prob(Q has answer yes/S) =

n pn⟨φn|Q|φn⟩,
(7)
where the pn is a sequence of non-negative real numbers summing to unity, and the
φn are mutually orthogonal vectors each of unit norm. If there is only one term φ1
in the right-hand side of (7),
Prob(Q has answer yes/S) = (φ1|Q|φ1),
(8)

then the state S is a pure state, represented in H in only one way except for the trivial
recourse to scalar multiples of φ1; if there is more than one term in the right-hand
side of (7), the state S is mixed and can be represented non-trivially in different ways.
Heisenberg [19] emphasizes a great conceptual difference between the probabil-
ities expressed by the coefﬁcients pn in (7) and that expressed by the inner product
(φ1|Q|φ1) in (8). He calls the former “subjective” because they do not express an
intrinsic indeﬁniteness of the constitution of the system, but rather a kind of partial
knowledge and partial ignorance on the part of the scientist, as is the case with the
probabilities occurring in classical statistical mechanics. The inner product in (8) he
calls “objective”, because it does not stem from ignorance on the part of the scientist.
Indeed, the vector φ1 represents the state of the system an sich, maximally character-
ized. The fact that some of the questions Q have neither ‘yes’ nor ‘no’ as answers but
probabilities intermediate between these extremes, characterizes the system itself
and only derivatively the scientist’s knowledge of the system. Heisenberg suggests
the name “potentiality” for this modality of objective reality, which is intermediate
between full actuality and mere logical possibility. Although he borrowed this name
from Aristotle, he actually generalized Aristotle’s embryological sense of “poten-
tiality” and introduced a radically new philosophical concept, which may very well
be the most profound contribution of quantum mechanics to philosophy. See also

Projection
Werner Stulpe
Projection, an idempotent linear  operator deﬁned on a vector space with values
in that vector space. That is, a linear operator P acting in a real or complex vector
space V is called a projection if (i) DP = V, DP being the domain of P, and (ii)
P 2 = P. For a projection P, I −P is also a projection, I being the unit operator.
Deﬁning X = RP and Y = RI−P where RP and RI−P denote the ranges of P
and I −P, a projection P induces the decomposition of the vector space V into the
linear submanifolds X and Y according to the direct sum V = X ⊕Y. That is, every
vector ψ ∈V can be written as a sum ψ = φ + χ where φ ∈X, χ ∈Y, and φ, χ
are uniquely determined (in particular, the zero vector is the only vector contained
in both, X and Y). Conversely, given a decomposition of V into the direct sum of
any two complementary submanifolds X and Y, V = X ⊕Y, then a projection P is
deﬁned according to Pψ = φ where ψ = φ +χ, φ ∈X, χ ∈Y; P is the projection
onto X w.r.t. Y. A projection P in a Banach space V need not be continuous, i.e.,
need not be bounded ( operator); a projection onto X w.r.t. Y is continuous if and
only if X and Y are closed submanifolds of the Banach space V [1].
In the context of Hilbert spaces ( Hilbert space), the concept of a projection can
be sharpened to that of an orthogonal projection [1–5], the latter being a projection
