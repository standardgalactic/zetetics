Abstract: We generalize the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the Jensen-Shannon diversity index by
considering a variational deﬁnition with respect to a generic mean, thereby extending the notion
of Sibson’s information radius. The variational deﬁnition applies to any arbitrary distance and
yields a new way to deﬁne a Jensen-Shannon symmetrization of distances. When the variational
optimization is further constrained to belong to prescribed families of probability measures, we
get relative Jensen-Shannon divergences and their equivalent Jensen-Shannon symmetrizations of
distances that generalize the concept of information projections. Finally, we touch upon applications
of these variational Jensen-Shannon divergences and diversity indices to clustering and quantization
tasks of probability measures, including statistical mixtures.

1. Introduction: Background and Motivations
The goal of the author is to methodologically contribute to an extension of the Sib-
son’s information radius [1] and also concentrate on analysis of the speciﬁed families of
distributions called exponential families [2].
Let (X , F) denote a measurable space [3] with sample space X and σ-algebra F on
the set X . The Jensen-Shannon divergence [4] (JSD) between two probability measures P
and Q (or probability distributions) on (X , F) is deﬁned by:
DJS[P, Q] := 1


DKL

,
(1)
where DKL denotes the Kullback–Leibler divergence [5,6] (KLD):
DKL[P : Q] :=
( R
X log
 dP(x)
dQ(x)

dP,
P ≪Q
+∞,
P ̸≪Q
(2)
where P ≪Q means that P is absolutely continuous with respect to Q [3], and dP
dQ is the
Radon–Nikodym derivative of P with respect to Q. Equation (2) can be rewritten using the
chain rule as:
DKL[P : Q] :=
( R
X
dP(x)
dQ(x) log
 dP(x)
dQ(x)

dQ,
P ≪Q

P ̸≪Q
(3)
Consider a measure µ for which both the Radon–Nikodym derivatives p :=
dP
dµ
and q := dP
dµ exist (e.g., µ = P+Q
2 ). Subsequently the Kullback–Leibler divergence can
be rewritten as (see Equation (2.5) page 5 of [5] and page 251 of the Cover & Thomas’
textbook [6]):

Denote by D = D(X ) the set of all densities with full support X (Radon–Nikodym
derivatives of probability measures with respect to µ):
D(X ) :=

p : X →R : p(x) > 0 µ-almost everywhere,
Z
X p(x)dµ(x) = 1

.
Subsequently, the Jensen-Shannon divergence [4] between two densities p and q of D is
deﬁned by:
DJS[p, q] := 1

Often, one considers the Lebesgue measure [3] µ = µL on (Rd, B(Rd)), where B(Rd) is
the Borel σ-algebra, or the counting measure [3] µ = µ# on (X , 2X ) where X is a countable
set, for deﬁning the measure space (X , F, µ).
The JSD belongs to the class of f-divergences [7–9] which are known as the invariant
decomposable divergences of information geometry (see [10], pp. 52–57). Although the
KLD is asymmetric (i.e., DKL[p : q] ̸= DKL[q : p]), the JSD is symmetric (i.e., DJS[p, q] =
DJS[q, p]). The notation ‘:’ is used as a parameter separator to indicate that the parameters
are not permutation invariant, and that the order of parameters is important.
In this work, a distance D(O1 : O2) is a measure of dissimilarity between two objects
O1 and O2, which do not need to be symmetric or satisfy the triangle inequality of metric
distances. A distance only satisﬁes the identity of indiscernibles: D(O1 : O2) = 0 if and
only if O1 = O2. When the objects O1 and O2 are probability densities with respect to
µ, we call this distance a statistical distance, use the brackets to enclose the arguments
of the statistical distance (i.e., D[O1 : O2]), and we have D[O1 : O2] = 0 if and only if
O1(x) = O2(x) µ-almost everywhere.
The 2-point JSD of Equation (4) can be extended to a weighted set of n densities P :=
{(w1, p1), . . . , (wn, pn)} (with positive wi’s normalized to sum up to unity, i.e., ∑n
i=1 wi = 1)
thus providing a diversity index, i.e., a n-point JSD for P:
DJS(P) :=
n
∑
i=1
wiDKL[pi : ¯p],
(6)
where ¯p := ∑n
i=1 wipi denotes the statistical mixture [11] of the densities of P. We have
DJS[p : q] = DJS({( 1
2, p), ( 1
2, q)}). We call DJS(P) the Jensen-Shannon diversity index.
The KLD is also called the relative entropy since it can be expressed as the difference
between the cross entropy h[p : q] and the entropy h[p]:
DKL[p : q]
:=
Z
X p(x) log
 p(x)
q(x)

dµ(x)
(7)
=
Z
X p(x) log p(x)dµ(x) −
Z
X p(x) log q(x)dµ(x),
(8)
=
h[p : q] −h[p],
(9)
with the cross-entropy and entropy deﬁned, respectively, by
h[p : q]
:=
−
Z
X p(x) log q(x)dµ(x),
(10)
h[p]
:=
−
Z
X p(x) log p(x)dµ(x).
(11)
Because h[p] = h[p : p], we may say that the entropy is the self-cross-entropy.

When µ is the Lebesgue measure, the Shannon entropy is also called the differential
entropy [6]. Although the discrete entropy H[p] = −∑i pi log pi (i.e., entropy with respect
to the counting measure) is always positive and bounded by log |X |, the differential entropy
may be negative (e.g., entropy of a Gaussian distribution with small variance).
The Jensen-Shannon divergence of Equation (6) can be rewritten as:
DJS[p, q] = h[ ¯p] −
n
∑
i=1
wih[pi] := J−h[p, q].
(12)
The JSD representation of Equation (12) is a Jensen divergence [12] for the strictly convex
negentropy F(p) = −h[p], since the entropy function h[.] is strictly concave. Therefore, it is
appropriate to call this divergence the Jensen-Shannon divergence.
Because pi(x)
¯p(x) ≤
pi(x)
wipi(x) =
1
wi , it can be shown that the Jensen-Shannon diversity
index is upper bounded by H(w) := −∑n
i=1 wi log wi, the discrete Shannon entropy. Thus,
the Jensen-Shannon diversity index is bounded by log n, and the 2-point JSD is bounded by
log 2, although the KLD is unbounded and it may even be equal to +∞when the deﬁnite
integral diverges (e.g., KLD between the standard Cauchy distribution and the standard
Gaussian distribution). Another nice property of the JSD is that its square root yields a
metric distance [13,14]. This property further holds for the quantum JSD [15]. The JSD
has gained interest in machine learning. See, for example, the Generative Adversarial
Networks [16] (GANs) in deep learning [17], where it was proven that minimizing the
GAN objective function by adversarial training is equivalent to minimizing a JSD.
To delineate the different roles that are played by the factor 1
2 in the ordinary Jensen-
Shannon divergence (i.e., in weighting the two KLDs and in weighting the two densities), let
us introduce two scalars α, β ∈(0, 1), and deﬁne a generic (α, β)-skewed Jensen-Shannon
divergence, as follows:
DJS,α,β[p : q]
:=
(1 −β)DKL[p : mα] + βDKL[q : mα],
(13)
=
(1 −β)h[p : mα] + βh[q : mα] −(1 −β)h[p] −βh[q],
(14)
=
h[mβ : mα] −((1 −β)h[p] + βh[q]),
(15)
where mα := (1 −α)p + αq and mβ := (1 −β)p + βq. This identity holds, because DJS,α,β
is bounded by (1 −β) log
1
1−α + β log 1
α, see [18]. Thus, when β = α, we have DJS,α[p, q] =
DJS,α,α[p, q] = h[mα] −((1 −α)h[p] + αh[q]), since the self-cross entropy corresponds to the
entropy: h[mα : mα] = h[mα].
A f-divergence [9,19,20] is deﬁned for a convex generator f, which is strictly convex
at 1 (to satisfy the identity of the indiscernibles) and that satisﬁes f (1) = 0, by
If [p : q] :=
Z
p(x) f
 q(x)
p(x)

dµ(x) ≥f (1) = 0,
(16)
where the right-hand-side follows from Jensen’s inequality [20]. For example, the total
variation distance DTV[p : q] = 1
2
R
X |p(x) −q(x)|dµ(x) is a f-divergence for the generator
fTV(u) = |u −1|: DTV[p : q] = IfTV[p : q]. The generator fTV(u) is convex on R, strictly
convex at 1, and it satisﬁes f (u) = 1.
The DJS,α,β divergence is a f-divergence
DJS,α,β[p : q] = IfJS,α,β[p : q],
(17)
for the generator:
fJS,α,β(u) = −

(1 −β) log(αu + (1 −α)) + βu log
1 −α

+ α

.
(18)

We check that the generator fJS,α,β is strictly convex, since, for any a ∈(0, 1) and b ∈(0, 1),
we have
f ′′
JS,α,β(u) =
a2(1 −b)u + (a −1)2b
a2u3 + 2a(1 −a)u2 + (a −1)2u > 0,
(19)
when u > 0.
The Jensen-Shannon principle of taking the average of the (Kullback–Leibler) di-
vergences between the source parameters to the mid-parameter can be applied to other
distances. For example, the Jensen–Bregman divergence is a Jensen-Shannon symmetriza-
tion of the Bregman divergence BF [12]:
BJS
F (θ1 : θ2) := 1
2

BF

θ1 : θ1 + θ2

+ BF

θ2 : θ1 + θ2

,
(20)
where the Bregman divergence [21] BF is deﬁned by
BF(θ : θ′) := F(θ) −F(θ′) −(θ −θ′)⊤∇F(θ′).
(21)
The Jensen–Bregman divergence BJS
F can also be written as an equivalent Jensen
divergence JF:
BJS
F (θ1 : θ2) = JF(θ1 : θ2) := F(θ1) + F(θ2)
2
−F
θ1 + θ2
2

,
(22)
where F is a strictly convex function ensuring JF(θ1 : θ2) ≥0 with equality if θ1 = θ2.
Because of its use in various ﬁelds of information sciences [22], various generalizations
of the JSD have been proposed: These generalizations are either based on Equation (5) [23]
or Equation (12) [18,24,25].
For example, the (arithmetic) mixture ¯p = ∑i wipi in
Equation (6) was replaced by an abstract statistical mixture with respect to a generic mean
M in [23] (e.g., the geometric mixture induced by the geometric mean), and the two KLDS
deﬁning the JSD in Equation (5) was further averaged using another abstract mean N,
thus yielding the following generic (M, N)-Jensen-Shannon divergence [23] (abbreviated as
(M, N)-JSD):

(23)
where (pq)M
α denotes the statistical weighted M-mixture:
(pq)M
α :=
Mα(p(x), q(x))
R
X Mα(p(x), q(x))dµ(x).
(24)
Notice that, when M = N = A (the arithmetic mean), Equation (23) of the (A, A)-JSD
reduces to the ordinary JSD of Equation (5). When the means M and N are symmetric,
the (M, N)-JSD is symmetric.
In general, a weighted mean Mα(a, b) for any α ∈[0, 1] shall satisfy the in-betweeness
property [26] (i.e., a mean should be contained inside its extrema):
min{a, b} ≤Mα(a, b) ≤max{a, b}.
(25)
The three Pythagorean means deﬁned for positive scalars a > 0 and b > 0 are classic
examples of means:
•
The arithmetic mean A(a, b) = a+b
2 ,
•
the geometric mean G(a, b) =
√
ab, and
•
the harmonic mean H(a, b) = 2ab
a+b.
These Pythagorean means may be interpreted as special instances of another paramet-
ric family of means: The power means

 1

,
(26)
deﬁned for α ∈R\{0} (also called Hölder means). The power means can be extended
to the full range α ∈R by using the property that limα→0 Pα(a, b) = G(a, b). The power
means are homogeneous means: Pα(λa, λb) = λPα(a, b) for any λ > 0. We refer to the
handbook of means [27] to obtain deﬁnitions and principles of other means beyond these
power means.
A weighted mean (also called barycenter) can be built from a non-weighted mean
M(a, b) (i.e., α = 1
2) by using the dyadic expansion of the real weight α ∈[0, 1], see [28]. That
is, we can deﬁne the weighted mean M(p, q; w, 1 −w) for w =
i
2k with i ∈{0, . . . , 2k} and
k an integer. For example, consider a symmetric mean M(p, q) = M(q, p). Subsequently,
we get the following weighted means when k = 3:

Choosing the abstract mean M in accordance with the family R = {pθ : θ ∈Θ} of the
densities allows one to obtain closed-form formula for the (M, N)-JSDs that rely on deﬁnite
integral calculations [23]. For example, the JSD between two Gaussian densities does not
admit a closed-form formula because of the log-sum integral, but the (G, N)-JSD admits
a closed-form formula when using geometric statistical mixtures (i.e., when M = G).
The calculus trick is to ﬁnd a weighted mean Mα, such that, for two densities pθ1 and
pθ2, the weighted mean distribution Mα(pθ1(x), pθ2(x)) =
pθ1,2,α(x)
ZMα(θ1,θ2), where ZMα(θ1, θ2)
is the normalizing coefﬁcient and pθ1,2,α ∈R. Thus, the integral calculation can be sim-
ply calculated as R
Mα(pθ1(x), pθ2(x))dµ(x) =
1
ZMα(θ1,θ2) since pθ1,2,α(x), and, therefore,
R
pθ1,2,α(x)dµ(x) = 1. This trick has also been used in Bayesian hypothesis testing for
upper bounding the probability of error between two densities of a parametric family of

Entropy 2021, 23, 464
6 of 28
distributions by replacing the usual geometric mean (Section 11.7 of [6], page 375) by a
more general quasi-arithmetic mean [29]. For example, the harmonic mean is well-suited
to Cauchy distributions, and the power means to Student t-distributions [29].
As an application of these generalized JSDs, Deasy et al. [30] used the skewed ge-
ometric JSD (namely, the (Gα, A1−α)-JSD for α ∈(0, 1)), which admits a closed-form
formula between normal densities [23], and showed how regularizing an optimization
task with this G-JSD divergence improved reconstruction and generation of Variational
AutoEncoders (VAEs).
More generally, instead of using the KLD, one can also use any arbitrary distance D to
deﬁne its JS-symmetrization, as follows:
DJS
M,N[p : q] := N

D
h
p : (pq)M
1
2
i
, D
h
q : (pq)M

i
.
(28)
These symmetrizations may further be skewed by using Mα and/or Nβ for α ∈(0, 1) and
β ∈(0, 1), yielding the deﬁnition [23]:
DJS
Mα,Nβ[p : q] := Nβ

D
h
p : (pq)M
α
i

h
q : (pq)M

(29)
With these notations, the ordinary JSD is DJS = DKL
JS
A,A, the (A, A) JS-symmetrization of
the KLD with respect to the arithmetic means M = A and N = A.
The JS-symmetrization can be interpreted as the Nβ-Jeffreys’ symmetrization of a
generalization of Lin’s α-skewed K-divergence [4] DK
Mα[p : q]:
DJS
Mα,Nβ[p : q]

.
(31)
In this work, we consider symmetrizing an arbitrary distance D (including the KLD),
generalizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence by using a variational formula for the JSD.
Namely, we observe that the Jensen-Shannon divergence can also be deﬁned as the follow-
ing minimization problem:
DJS[p, q] := min
c∈D
1
2(DKL[p : c] + DKL[q : c]),
(32)
since the optimal density c is proven unique using the calculus of variation [1,31,32] and it
corresponds to the mid density p+q
2 , a statistical (arithmetic) mixture.
Proof. Let S(c) = DKL[p : c] + DKL[q : c] ≥0. We use the method of the Lagrange multi-
pliers for the constrained optimization problem minc S(c) such that R
c(x)dµ(x) = 1. Let
us minimize S(c) + λ(
R
c(x)dµ(x) −1). The density c realizing the minimum S(c) satisﬁes
the Euler–Lagrange equation ∂L
∂c = 0, where L(c) := p log p
c + q log q
c + λc is the Lagrangian.
That is, −p
c −q
c + λ = 0 or, equivalently, c = 1
λ(p + q). Parameter λ is then evaluated from
the constraint R
X c(x)dµ(x) = 1: we get λ = 2 since R
X (p(x) + q(x))dµ(x) = 2. Therefore,
we ﬁnd that c(x) = p(x)+q(x)
2
, the mid density of p(x) and q(x).
Considering Equation (32) instead of Equation (5) for deﬁning the Jensen-Shannon
divergence is interesting, because it allows one to consider a novel approach for general-
izing the Jensen-Shannon divergence. This variational approach was ﬁrst considered by
Sibson [1] to deﬁne the α-information radius of a set of weighted distributions while using
Rényi α-entropies that are based on Rényi principled α-means [33]. The α-information
radius includes the Jensen-Shannon diversity index when α = 1. Sibson’s work is our
point of departure for generalizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence and proposing the
Jensen-Shannon symmetrizations of arbitrary distances.

The paper is organized, as follows: in Section 2, we recall the rationale and deﬁnitions
of the Rényi α-entropy and the Rényi α-divergence [33], and explain the information radius
of Sibson [1], which includes, as a special case, the ordinary Jensen-Shannon divergence
and that can be interpreted as generalized skew Bhattacharyya distances. We report,
in Theorem 2, a closed-form formula for calculating the information radius of order α
between two densities of an exponential family when 1
α is an integer. It is noteworthy
to point out that Sibson’s work (1969) includes, as a particular case of the information
radius, a deﬁnition of the JSD, prior to the well-known reference paper of Lin [4] (1991).
In Section 3, we present the JS-symmetrization variational deﬁnition that is based on a
generalization of the information radius with a generic mean (Equation (88) and Deﬁni-
tion 3). In Section 4, we constrain the mixture density to belong to a prescribed class of
(parametric) probability densities, like an exponential family [2], and obtain a relative
information radius generalizing information radius and related to the concept of informa-
tion projections. Our Deﬁnition 5 generalizes the (relative) normal information radius of
Sibson [1], who considered the multivariate normal family (Proposition 4). We illustrate
this notion of relative information radius by calculating the density of an exponential family
minimizing the reverse Kullback–Leibler divergence between a mixture of densities of that
exponential family (Proposition 6). Moreover, we get a semi-closed-form formula for the
Kullback–Leibler divergence between the densities of two different exponential families
(Proposition 5), generalizing the Fenchel–Young divergence [34]. As an application of these
relative variational JSDs, we touch upon the problems of clustering and quantization of
probability densities in Section 4.2. Finally, we conclude by summarizing our contributions
and discussing related works in Section 5.
2. Rényi Entropy and Divergence, and Sibson Information Radius
Rényi [33] investigated a generalization of the four axioms of Fadeev [35], yielding
the unique Shannon entropy [20]. In doing so, Rényi replaced the ordinary weighted
arithmetic mean by a more general class of averaging schemes. Namely, Rényi considered
the weighted quasi-arithmetic means [36]. A weighted quasi-arithmetic mean can be
induced by a strictly monotonous and continuous function g, as follows:
Mg(x1, . . . , xn; w1, . . . , wn) := g−1
 
n
∑
i=1
wig(xi)
!
,
(33)
where the xi’s and the wi’s are positive (the weights are normalized, so that ∑n
i=1 wi = 1).
Because Mg = M−g, we may assume without loss of generality that g is a strictly increasing
and continuous function. The quasi-arithmetic means were investigated independently by
Kolmogorov [36], Nagumo [37], and de Finetti [38].
For example, the power means Pα(a, b) =

aα+bα

arithmetic means for the generator gP
α (u) := uα:
Pα(a, b) = MgPα


.
(34)
Rényi proved that, among the class of weighted quasi-arithmetic means, only the
means induced by the family of functions
gα(u)

To obtain an intuition of the Rényi entropy, we may consider generalized entropies
derived from quasi-arithmetic means, as follows:
hg[p] := −Mg(log2 p1, . . . , log2 pn; p1, . . . , pn).
(39)
When g(u) = u, we recover Shannon entropy. When g2(u) = 2u, we get hg2[p] =
−log2 ∑i p2
i , called the collision entropy, since −log Pr[X1 = X2] = hg2[p], when X1
and X2 are independent and identically distributed random variables with X1 ∼p and
X2 ∼p. When g(u) = gα(u) = 2(α−1)u, we get

The formula of Equation (41) is the discrete Rényi α-entropy [33], which can be deﬁned
more generally on a measure space (X , F, µ), as follows:

1 −α log
Z
X pα(x)dµ(x)

,
α ∈(0, 1) ∪(1, ∞).
(42)
In the limit case α →1, the Rényi α-entropy converges to Shannon entropy: limα→1 hR
α [p] =
h[p]. Rényi α-entropies are non-increasing with respect to increasing α: hR
α [p] ≥hR
α′[p] for
α < α′. In the discrete case (i.e., counting measure µ on a ﬁnite alphabet X ), we can further
deﬁne h0[p] = log |X | for α = 0 (also called max-entropy or Hartley entropy). The Rényi
+∞-entropy
h+∞[p] = −log max
x∈X p(x)
is also called the min-entropy, since the sequence hα is non-increasing with respect to
increasing α.

Similarly, Rényi obtained the α-divergences for α > 0 and α ̸= 1 (originally called
information gain of order α):
DR
α [p : q] :=
1

(43)
generalizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence, since limα→1 DR
α [p : q] = DKL[p : q]. Rényi
α-divergences are non-decreasing with respect to increasing α [39]: DR
α [p : q] ≤DR
α′[p : q]
for α′ ≥α.
Sibson (Robin Sibson (1944–2017) is also renown for inventing the natural neighbour
interpolation [40]) [1] considered both the Rényi α-divergence [33] DR
α and the Rényi α-
weighted mean MR
α := Mgα to deﬁne the information radius Rα of order α of a weighted
set P = {(wi, pi)}n

(46)
where function LSE(a1, . . . , an) := log(∑n

This family of symmetric divergences may be called the Sibson’s α-divergences,
and the Jensen-Shannon divergence is interpreted as a limit case when α →1. No-
tice that, since we have limα→∞Pα(p, q) = max{p, q} and limα→∞
α
α−1 = 1, we have
limα→∞Rα(p, q) = R∞(p, q). Notice that, for α = 1, the integral and logarithm operations
are swapped as compared to Rα for α ∈(0, 1) ∪(1, ∞).
Theorem 2. When α = 1
k for an integer k ≥2, the Sibson α-divergences between two densities
pθ1 and pθ2 of an exponential family {pθ : θ ∈Θ} with cumulant function F(θ) is available in

Proof. Let p = pθ1 and q = pθ2 be two densities of an exponential family [2] with cumulant
function F(θ) and natural parameter space Θ. Without a loss of generality, we may consider
a natural exponential family [2] with densities written canonically as pθ(x) = exp(x⊤θ −
F(θ)) for θ ∈Θ. It can be shown that the cumulant function F(θ) = log R
X exp(x⊤θ)dµ(x)
is strictly convex and analytic on the open convex natural parameter space Θ [2].

This closed-form formula applies, in particular, to the family {N (µ, Σ)} of (multivari-
ate) normal distributions: In this case, the natural parameters θ are expressed using both a
vector parameter component v and a matrix parameter component M:
θ = (v, M) =

(68)
and the cumulant function is:
FN (θ) = d
2 log π −1
2 log | −2M| −1
4v⊤M−1v,
(69)
where | · | denotes the matrix determinant.
In general, the optimal density c∗
α = arg minc∈D Rα(P, c) yielding the information
radius Rα(P) can be interpreted as a generalized centroid (extending the notion of Fréchet
means [48]) with respect to (MR
α , DR
α ), where a (M, D)-centroid is deﬁned by:
Deﬁnition 1 ((M, D)-centroid). Let P = {(w1, p1), . . . , (wn, pn)} be a normalized weighted
parameter set, M a mean, and D a distance. Subsequently, the (M, D)-centroid is deﬁned as
cM,D(P) = arg min
c
M(D(p1 : c), . . . , D(pn : c); w1, . . . , wn).
Here, we give a general deﬁnition of the (M, D)-centroid for an arbitrary distance (not
necessarily a symmetric nor metric distance). The parameter set can either be probability
measures having densities with respect to a given measure µ or a set of vectors. In the
ﬁrst case, the distance D is called a statistical distance. When the densities belong to a
parametric family of densities P = {pθ
: θ ∈Θ}, the statistical distance D[pθ1 : pθ2]
amounts to a parameter distance: DP(θ1 : θ2) := D[pθ1 : pθ2]. For example, when all of the
densities pi’s belong to a same natural exponential family [2]
P = {pθ(x) = exp(θ⊤t(x) −F(θ)) : θ ∈Θ}
with cumulant function F(θ) = log R
exp(θ⊤t(x))dµ(x) (i.e., pi = pθi) and sufﬁcient
statistic vector t(x), we have DKL[pθ : pθi] = B∗
F(θ : θi) := BF(θi : θ), where B∗
F denotes the
reverse Bregman divergence (by parameter order swapping) the Bregman divergence [21]
BF deﬁned by
BF(θ : θ′) := F(θ) −F(θ′) −(θ −θ′)⊤∇F(θ′).
(70)
Thus, we have DP(θ1 : θ2) := B∗
F(θ1 : θ2) = DKL[pθ1 : pθ2].
Let V = {(w1, θ1), . . . , (wn, θn)} be the parameter set corresponding to P. Deﬁne
RF(V, θ) :=
n
∑
i=1
wiBF(θi : θ).
(71)

Entropy 2021, 23, 464

Subsequently, we have the equivalent decomposition of Proposition 1:
RF(V, θ) −RF(V, θ∗) = BF(θ∗: θ),
(72)
with θ∗= ¯θ := ∑n
i=1 wiθi. (this decomposition is used to prove Proposition 1 of [21]). The
quantity RF(V) = RF(V, θ∗) was termed the Bregman information [21,49]. The Bregman
information generalizes the variance that was obtained when the Bregman divergence is
the squared Euclidean distance. RF(V) could also be called Bregman information radius
according to Sibson. Because RF(V) = ∑n
i=1 wiDKL[p ¯θ : pθi], we can interpret the Bregman
information as a Sibson’s information radius for densities of an exponential family with
respect to the arithmetic mean MR
1 = A and the reverse Kullback–Leibler divergence:
D∗
KL[p : q] := DKL[q : p]. This observation yields us the JS-symmetrization of distances
based on generalized information radii in Section 3.
More generally, we may consider the densities belonging to a deformed q-exponential
family (see [10], page 85–89 and the monograph [50]). Deformed q-exponential families
generalize the exponential families, and include the q-Gaussians [10]. A common way
to measure the statistical distance between two densities of a q-exponential family is the
q-divergence [10], which is related to Tsallis’ entropy [51]. We may also deﬁne another
statistical divergence between two densities of a q-exponential family which amounts to
Bregman divergence. For example, we refer to [52] for details concerning the family of
Cauchy distributions, which are q-Gaussians for q = 2.
Sibson proved that the information radii of any order are all upper bounded (Theo-
rem 2.8 and Theorem 2.9 of [1]) as follows:

We interpret Sibson’s upper bounds of Equations (73)–(75), as follows:
Proposition 2 (Information radius upper bound). The information radius of order α of a
weighted set of distributions is upper bounded by the discrete Rényi entropy of order 1
α of the weight

3. JS-Symmetrization of Distances Based on Generalized Information Radius
Let us give the following deﬁnitions generalizing the information radius (i.e., Jensen-
Shannon symmetrization of the distance when |P| = 2) and the ordinary Jensen-Shannon
divergence:
Deﬁnition 2 ((M, D)-information radius). Let M be a weighted mean and D a distance. Subse-
quently, the generalized information radius for a weighted set of points (e.g., vectors or densities)
(w1, p1), . . . , (wn, pn) is:
RM,D(P) := min
c∈D M(D(p1 : c), . . . , D(pn : c); w1, . . . , wn).
Recall that we also deﬁned the (M, D)-centroid in Deﬁnition 1 as follows:
cM,D(P) := arg min
c∈D M(D(p1 : c), . . . , D(pn : c); w1, . . . , wn).
When M = A, we recover the notion of Fréchet mean [48]. Notice that, although the
minimum RM,D(P) is unique, several generalized centroids cM,D(P) may potentially
exist, depending on (M, D). In particular, Deﬁnition 2 and Deﬁnition 1 apply when D is

Entropy 2021, 23, 464

a statistical distance, i.e., a distance between densities (Radon–Nikodym derivatives of
corresponding probability measures with respect to a dominating measure µ).
The generalized information radius can be interpreted as a diversity index or an n-
point distance. When n = 2, we get the following (2-point) distances, which are considered
as a generalization of the Jensen-Shannon divergence or Jensen-Shannon symmetrization:
Deﬁnition 3 (M-vJS symmetrization of D). Let M be a mean and D a statistical distance.
Subsequently, the variational Jensen-Shannon symmetrization of D is deﬁned by the formula of a
generalized information radius:
DvJS
M [p : q] := min
c∈D M(D[p : c], D[q : c]).
We use the acronym vJS to distinguish it with the JS-symmetrization reported in [23]:

which is the Bregman information [21]. Notice that we may skew these generalized JSDs
by taking weighted mean Mβ instead of M for β ∈(0, 1), yielding the general deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 4 (Skew Mβ-vJS symmetrization of D). Let Mβ be a weighted mean and D a
statistical distance. Subsequently, the variational skewed Jensen-Shannon symmetrization of D is
deﬁned by the formula of a generalized information radius:
DvJS
Mβ[p : q] := min
c∈D Mβ(D[p : c], D[q : c])
Example 1. For example, the skewed Jensen–Bregman divergence of Equation (20) can be inter-
preted as a Jensen-Shannon symmetrization of the Bregman divergence BF [12] since we have:
BF
vJS
Aβ (θ1 : θ2)

θ∈Θ(1 −β)BF(θ1 : θ) + βBF(θ2 : θ),

(1 −β)BF(θ1 : (1 −β)θ1 + βθ2) + βBF(θ2 : (1 −β)θ1 + βθ2), (78)
=:
JBF,β(θ1 : θ2).
(79)
Indeed, the Bregman barycenter arg minθ∈Θ(1 −β)BF(θ1 : θ) + BF(θ2 : θ) is unique and it
corresponds to θ = (1 −β)θ1 + βθ2, see [21]. The skewed Jensen–Bregman divergence JBF,β(θ1 :
θ2) can also be rewritten as an equivalent skewed Jensen divergence (see Equation (22)):
JBF,β(θ1 : θ2)
=
(1 −β)BF(θ1 : (1 −β)θ1 + βθ2) + βBF(θ2 : (1 −β)θ1 + βθ2), (80)
=
(1 −β)F(θ1) + βF(θ2) −F((1 −β)θ1 + βθ2),
(81)
=:
JF,β(θ1 : θ2).
(82)
Example 2. Consider a conformal Bregman divergence [53] that is deﬁned by
BF,ρ(θ1 : θ2) = ρ(θ1)BF(θ1 : θ2),

where ρ(θ) > 0 is a conformal factor. Subsequently, we have

(86)
where γ1 =

(1−β)ρ(θ1)+βρ(θ2) and γ2 =
βρ(θ2)
(1−β)ρ(θ1)+βρ(θ2) = 1 −γ1.
Notice that this deﬁnition is implicit and it can be made explicit when the centroid
c∗(p, q) is unique:
DvJS
Mβ[p : q] = Mβ(D[p : c∗(p, q)], D[q : c∗(p, q)]
(87)
In particular, when D = DKL, the KLD, we obtain generalized skewed Jensen-Shannon
divergences for Mβ a weighted mean with β ∈(0, 1):
D
Mβ
vJS [p : q] := min
c∈D Mβ(DKL[p : c], DKL[q : c]).

Example 3. Amari [31] obtained the (A, Dα)-information radius and its corresponding unique
centroid for Dα, the α-divergence of information geometry [10] (page 67).
Example 4. Brekelmans et al. [54] studied the geometric path (p1p2)G
β (x) ∝p1−β

(x)pβ
2(x)
between two distributions p1 and p2 of D, where Gβ(a, b) = a1−βbβ (with a, b > 0) is the
weighted geometric mean. They proved the variational formula:
(p1p2)G
β = min
c∈D (1 −β)DKL[c : p1] + βDKL[c : p2].
(89)
That is, (p1p2)G
β is a Gβ-D∗
KL centroid, where D∗
KL is the reverse KLD. The corresponding
(Gβ, D∗
KL)-vJSD is studied is [23] and it is used in deep learning in [30].
It is interesting to study the link between (Mβ, D)-variational Jensen-Shannon symmetriza-
tion of D and the (M′
α, N′
β)-JS symmetrization of [23]. In particular, the link between Mβ for
averaging in the minimization and M′
α the mean for generating abstract mixtures.
More generally, Brekelmans et al. [55] considered the α-divergences extended to positive
measures (i.e., a separable divergence built as the different between a weighted arithmetic mean and
a geometric mean [56]):

That is, c∗

Example 5. The q-divergence [57] Dq between two densities of a q-exponential family amounts
to a Bregman divergence [10,57]. Thus, DvJS
q
for M = A is a generalized information radius that
amounts to a Bregman information.

For the case α = ∞in Sibson’s information radius, we ﬁnd that the information radius
is related to the total variation:
Proposition 3 (Lemma 2.4 [1]). :

Z
X max{p(x), q(x)}dµ(x) = 1 + DTV[p : q].
From Theorem 1, we have R∞({( 1

X max{p(x), q(x)}dµ(x) and, there-

Notice that, when M = Mg is a quasi-arithmetic mean, we may consider the diver-
gence Dg[p : q] = g−1(D[p : q)), so that the centroid of the (Mg, Dg)-JS symmetrization is:

The generalized α-skewed Bhattacharyya divergence [29] can also be considered with
respect to a weighted mean Mα:
DBhat,Mα[p : q] = −log
Z
X Mα(p(x), q(x))dµ(x).
In particular, when Mα is a quasi-arithmetic weighted mean that is induced by a strictly
continuous and monotone function g, we have
DBhat,g,α[p : q] := −log
Z
X Mg(p(x), q(x); α)dµ(x) =: DBhat,(Mg)α[p : q].
Because min{p(x), q(x)} ≤Mg(p(x), q(x); α) ≤max{p(x), q(x)}, min{a, b} =

X Mg(p(x), q(x); α)dµ(x) ≤1 + DTV[p, q] ≤2.
(96)
The information radius of Sibson for α ∈(0, 1) ∪(1, ∞) may be interpreted as gener-
alized scaled α-skewed Bhattacharyya divergences with respect to the power means Pα,
since we have Rα(p, q) =

4. Relative Information Radius and Relative Jensen-Shannon Symmetrizations
of Distances
4.1. Relative Information Radius
In this section, instead of considering the full space of densities D on (X , F, µ) for
performing the variational optimization of the information radius, we rather consider
a subfamily of (parametric) densities R ⊂D. Subsequently, we deﬁne accordingly the
R-relative Jensen-Shannon divergence (R-JSD for short) as

In particular, Sibson [1] considered the normal information radius, i.e., the R-relative
Jensen-Shannon divergence with R = {N (µ, Σ)
:
(µ, Σ) ∈Rd × Pd++}, where Pd++
denotes the open cone of d × d positive-deﬁnite matrices (positive-deﬁnite covariance
matrices of Gaussian distributions). More generally, we may consider any exponential
family E [2].
Deﬁnition 5 (Relative (R, M)-JS symmetrization of D). Let M be a mean and D a statistical
distance. Subsequently, the relative (R, M)-JS symmetrization of D is:
DvJS
M,R[p : q] := min
c∈R M(D[p : c], D[q : c]).
We obtain the relative Jensen-Shannon divergences when D = DKL.
Example 6. Grosse et al. [58] considered geometric and moment average paths for annealing. They
proved that, when p1 = pθ1 and p2 = pθ2 belong to an exponential family [2] EF with cumulant
function F, we have
(p1p2)G
β =
p1(x)1−βp2(x)β
R
p1(x)1−βp2(x)βdµ(x) = arg min
c∈EF
{(1 −β)DKL[c : p1] + βDKL[c : p2]}, (98)
and
p ¯η = arg min
c∈EF
{(1 −β)DKL[p1 : c] + βDKL[c : p2]},
(99)
where ¯η = (1 −β)η1 + βη2, ηi = Epθi [t(x)] (this is not an arithmetic mixture, but an exponential
family density moment parameter that is a mixture of the parameters).
The corresponding minima can be interpreted as relative skewed Jensen-Shannon symmetriza-
tion for the reverse KLD D∗
KL (Equation (98)) and the relative skewed Jensen-Shannon divergence
(Equation (99)):

(101)
where Aβ(a, b) := (1 −β)a + βb is the weighted arithmetic mean for β ∈(0, 1).
Notice that, when p = q, we have DvJS
M,R[p : p] = minc∈R D[p : c], which is the
information projection [59] with respect to D of density p to the submanifold R. Thus,
when p ̸∈R, we have DvJS
M,R[p : p] > 0, i.e., the relative JSDs are not proper divergences,
since a proper divergence ensures that D[p : q] ≥0 with equality if p = q. Figure 1
illustrates the main cases of the relative Jensen-Shannon divergenc between p and q: Either
p and q are both inside or outside R, or one point is inside R, while the other point is
outside R. When p = q, we get an information projection when both of the points are
outside R, and DR
vJS[p : p] = 0 when p ∈R. When p, q ∈R with p ̸= q, the value
DR
vJS[p : q] corresponds to the information radius (and the arg min to the right-sided
Kullback–Leibler centroid).

4.2. Relative Jensen-Shannon Divergences: Applications to Density Clustering and Quantization
Let DKL[p : qθ] be the Kullback–Leibler divergence between an arbitrary density p and
a density qθ of an exponential family Q = {qθ : θ ∈Θ}. Let us canonically express [2,60]
the density qθ(x), as
qθ(x) = exp

θ⊤tQ(x) −FQ(θ) + kQ(x)

,
where tQ(x) denotes the sufﬁcient statistics, kQ(x) is an auxiliary carrier measure term (e.g.,
k(x) = 0 for the Gaussian family and k(x) = log(x) for the Rayleigh family [60]), and FQ(θ)
the cumulant function. Assume that we know in closed-form the following quantities:
•
mp := Ep[tQ(x)] = R
p(x)tQ(x)dµ(x) and
•
the Shannon entropy h[p] = −R
p(x) log p(x)dµ(x) of p.
Subsequently, we can express the KLD using a semi-closed-form formula.
Proposition 4. Let qθ ∈Q be a density of an exponential family and p an arbitrary density with
mp = Ep[tQ(x)]. Subsequently, the Kullback–Leibler divergence between p and qθ is expressed as:
DKL[p : qθ] = FQ(θ) −m⊤
p θ −Ep[kQ(x)] −h[p],
(102)
where h[p : qθ] = FQ(θ) −m⊤
p θ −Ep[kQ(x)] is the cross-entropy between p and qθ.

Entropy 2021, 23, 464
19 of 28
Proof. The proof is straightforward since log qθ(x) = θ⊤tQ(x) −FQ(θ) + kQ(x). Therefore,
we have:
DKL[p : qθ]
=
h[p : qθ] −h[p],
(103)
=
−
Z
X p(x) log qθ(x)dµ(x) −h[p],
(104)
=
FQ(θ) −m⊤
p θ −Ep[kQ(x)] −h[p].
(105)
Example 7. For example, when qθ = qµ,Σ is the density of a multivariate Gaussian distribution
N (µ, Σ) (with kN (x) = 0), we have
DKL[p : qµ,Σ] = 1
2

log |2πΣ| + (µ −m)⊤Σ−1(µ −m) + tr(Σ−1S)

−h[p],
(106)
where m = µ(p) = Ep[X] and S = Cov(p) := Ep

XX⊤ −Ep[X]Ep[X]⊤.
The formula of Proposition 4 is said in semi-closed-form, because it relies on knowing
both the entropy h of p and the sufﬁcient statistic moments Ep[tQ(x)]. Yet, this semi-closed
formula may prove to be useful in practice: For example, we can answer the compari-
son predicate
“Is DKL[p : qθ1] ≥DKL[p : qθ2] or not?”
by checking whether FQ(θ1) −FQ(θ2) −m⊤
p (θ1 −θ2) ≥0 or not (i.e., the terms −Ep[kQ(x)] −
h[p] in Equation (102) cancel out). Thus, we get a closed-form predicate, although DKL is
only known in semi-closed-form. This KLD comparison predicate shall be used later on
when clustering densities with respect to centroids in Section 4.2.
Remark 1. Note that when Y = f (X) for an invertible and differentiable transformation f then
we have h[Y] = h[X] + EX[log |Jf (X)|] where Jf denotes the Jacobian matrix. For example, when
Y = f (X) = AX, we have h[Y] = h[X] + log |A|.
When p belongs to an exponential family P (P may be different from Q) with cu-
mulant function FP, sufﬁcient statistics tP(x), auxiliary carrier term kP(x), and natural
parameter θ, we have the entropy [61] expressed, as follows:
h[p]
=
FP(θ) −θ⊤∇FP(θ) −Ep[kP(x)],
(107)
=
−F∗
P(η) −Ep[kP(x)],
(108)
where F∗
P(η) = θ⊤∇F(θ) −F(θ) is the Legendre transform of F(θ) and η = η(θ) = ∇F(θ)
is called the moment parameter since we have η(θ) = Ep[tP(x)] [2,60].
It follows the following proposition reﬁning Proposition 4 when p = pθ ∈P:
Proposition 5. Let pθ be a density of an exponential family P and qθ′ be a density of an exponential
family Q. Subsequently, the Kullback–Leibler divergence between pθ and qθ′ is expressed as:
DKL[pθ : qθ′] = FQ(θ′) + F∗
P(η) −Epθ[tQ(x)]⊤θ′ + Epθ[kP(x) −kQ(x)].
(109)
Proof. We have
DKL[pθ : qθ′]
=
h[pθ : qθ′] −h[pθ],
(110)
=
FQ(θ′) −m⊤
pθθ′ −Epθ[kQ(x)] + F∗
P(η) + Epθ[kP(x)],
(111)
=
FQ(θ′) + F∗
P(η) −Epθ[tQ(x)]⊤θ′ + Epθ[kP(x) −kQ(x)].
(112)

Entropy 2021, 23, 464

In particular, when p and q belong both to the same exponential family (i.e., P = Q
with kP(x) = kQ(x)), we have F(θ) := FP(θ) := FQ(θ) and Epθ[tQ(x)] = ∇F(θ) =: η, and
DKL[pθ : qθ′] = F(θ′) + F∗(η) −θ′⊤η.
This last equation is the Fenchel–Young divergence in Bregman manifolds [34,62] (called
dually ﬂat spaces in information geometry [10]). Thus the divergence can be rewritten as
equivalent dual Bregman divergences:
DKL[pθ : qθ′]
=
F(θ′) + F∗(η) −η⊤θ′,
(113)
=
BF(θ′ : θ),
(114)
=
BF∗(η : η′),
(115)
where η′ = ∇F(θ′).
Notice that DKL[pθ : Q] := minθ′∈Θ′ DKL[pθ : qθ′] is unique and can be calculated as
η′ = ∇FQ(θ′) = Epθ[tQ(x)].
Let us report two examples of calculations of the KLD between two densities of two
exponential families.
Example 8. For the ﬁrst exponential family, consider the family of Laplacian distributions:
P = L =

pσ(x) := 1

.
The canonical decomposition of the density yields tL(x) = |x|, θ = −1
σ, kL(x) = 0, and FL(θ) =
log 2
−θ . (i.e., FL(θ(σ)) = log 2σ). It follows that η(θ) = F′
L(θ) = −1
θ (η(σ) = σ = E[|x|]),
θ(η) = −1
η , and F∗
L(η) = −1 −log(2η) and, therefore, F∗
L(η(σ)) = −1 −log(2σ).
For the second family, consider the exponential family of zero-centered Gaussian distributions:
Q = N0 =

We have tN0(x) = x2, kN0(x) = 0, θ′ = −

2(σ′)2 , and FN0(σ′) = 1
2 log(2π(σ′)2).
Moreover, let us calculate Epσ[tN0(x)] = Epσ[x2] = 2σ2. Subsequently, we can calculate the
Kullback–Leibler divergence between pσ ∼L(σ) and qσ′ ∼N0(σ′), as follows:
DKL[pσ : qσ′]
=
FQ(θ′(σ′)) + F∗
P(η(σ)) −Epσ[tQ(x)]⊤θ′(σ′) + Epσ[kP(x) −kQ(x)], (116)

Notice that DKL[pσ : qσ′] ≥0, but never 0 since the P ∩Q = ∅.
Let us now compute the reverse Kullback–Leibler divergence DKL[qσ′ : pσ]. We ﬁrst calculate
Eqσ′ [tL(x)] = Eqσ′(σ′)[|x|] =

2 log(2πη). Therefore, we get F∗
Q(η′(σ′)) =
−h[qσ′] = −1
2 log(2πe(σ′)2).
It follows that
DKL[qσ′ : pσ]

Again, we have DKL[qσ′ : pσ] ≥0, but never 0, because P ∩Q = ∅.
Example 9. Let us use the formula of Equation (109) to calculate the KLD between two Weibull

, and f-divergences [65], including the Kullback–Leibler divergence
are invariant by a differentiable transformation [66].
Jeffreys’ divergence symmetrizes the KLD divergence, as follows:
DJ[p : q] := DKL[p : q] + DKL[q : p] = 2A(DKL[p : q], DKL[q : p]).
(128)
The Jeffreys divergence between two densities of different exponential families P and Q is
DJ[pθ : qθ′] = θ′⊤(η′ −Epθ[tQ(x)]) + θ⊤(η −Eqθ′ [tP(x)]) + Epθ[kP(x) −kQ(x)] + Eqθ′ [kQ(x) −kP(x)].
(129)
When P = Q, we have Epθ[tQ(x)] = η and Eqθ′ [tP(x)]) = η′, so that we ﬁnd the
usual expression of the Jeffreys divergence between two densities of an exponential family:
DJ[pθ : pθ′] = (θ′ −θ)⊤(η′ −η).
(130)

Entropy 2021, 23, 464

To ﬁnd the best density qθ approximating p by minimizing minθ DKL[p : qθ], we solve
∇F(θ) = η = m and, therefore, θ = ∇F∗(m) = (∇F)−1(m), where F∗(η) = Eqη[log qη(m)],
with F∗denoting the Legendre–Fenchel convex conjugate [2]. In particular, when p =
∑wipθi is a mixture of EFs (with m = Ep[t(x)] = ∑wiηi with ηi = Epθi [t(x)] thanks to the
linearity of the expectation), then the best density of the EF simplifying p is

(132)
Taking the gradient with respect to θ, we have ∇F(θ) = η = ∑wiηi. This yields
another proof without the Pythagoras theorem [67,68].
Proposition 6. Let m(x) = ∑wipθi(x) be a mixture with components that belong to an ex-
ponential family with cumulant function F. Subsequently, θ∗= argθ minθ DKL[p : qθ] is
∇F∗(∑n
i=1 wiηi), where the ηi = ∇F(θi) are the moment parameters of the mixture components.
Consider the following two problems:
Problem 1 (Density clustering). Given a set of n weighted densities (w1, p1), . . . , (wn, pn),
partition them into k clusters C1, . . . , Ck in order to minimize the k-centroid objective function with
respect to a statistical divergence D: ∑n
i=1 wi minl∈{1,...,k} D[pi : cl], where cl denotes the centroid
of cluster Cl for l ∈{1, . . . , k}.
For example, when all the densities pi’s are isotropic Gaussians, we recover the
k-means objective function [69].
Problem 2 (Mixture component quantization). Given a statistical mixture m(x) = ∑n
i=1 wi
pi(x), quantize the mixture components into k densities q1, . . . , qk in order to minimize ∑i wi
minl∈{1,...,k} D[pi : ql].
Notice that, in Problem 1, the input densities pi’s may be mixtures, i.e., pi(x) =
∑ni
j=1 wi,jpi,j(x). Using the relative information radius, we can cluster a set of distributions
(potentially mixtures) into an exponential family mixture, or quantize an exponential
family mixture. Indeed, we can implement an extension of k-means [69] with k-centers qθi,
to assign density pi to cluster Cj (with center qj), we need to perform basic comparison
tests DKL[pi : qθl] ≥DKL[pi : qθj]. Provided that the cumulant F of the exponential family
is in closed-form, we do not need formula for the entropies h(pi).
Clustering and quantization of densities/mixtures have been widely studied in the
literature, see, for example, [70–76].

The JSD Equation (133) was studied by Sibson in 1969 within the wider scope of infor-
mation radius [1]: Sibson relied on the Rényi α-divergences (relative Rényi α-entropies [77])
and recovered the ordinary Jensen-Shannon divergence as a particular case of the α-

information radius when α = 1 and n = 2 points. The α-information radii are related to
generalized Bhattacharyya distances with respect to power means and the total variation
distance in the limit case of α = ∞.
Lin [4] investigated the JSD Equation (134) in 1991 with its connection to the JSD
deﬁned in Equation (134)). In Lin [4], the JSD is interpreted as the arithmetic symmetriza-
tion of the K-divergence [24]. Generalizations of the JSD based on Equation (134) were
proposed in [23] using a generic mean instead of the arithmetic mean. One motivation
was to obtain a closed-form formula for the geometric JSD between multivariate Gaussian
distributions, which relies on the geometric mixture (see [30] for a use case of that formula
in deep learning). Indeed, the ordinary JSD between Gaussians is not available in closed-
form (not analytic). However, the JSD between Cauchy distributions admit a closed-form
formula [78], despite the calculation of a deﬁnite integral of a log-sum term. Instead of
using an abstract mean to deﬁne a mid-distribution of two densities, one may also consider
the mid-point of a geodesic linking these two densities (the arithmetic means p+q
2
is inter-
preted as a geodesic midpoint). Recently, Li [79] investigated the transport Jensen-Shannon
divergence as a symmetrization of the Kullback–Leibler divergence in the L2-Wasserstein
space. See Section 5.4 of [79] and the closed-form formula of Equation (18) obtained for the
transport Jensen-Shannon divergence between two multivariate Gaussian distributions.
The generalization of the identity between the JSD of Equation (134) and the JSD of
Equation (135) was studied while using a skewing vector in [18]. Although the JSD is
a f-divergence [8,18], the Sibson-M Jensen-Shannon symmetrization of a distance does
not belong, in general, to the class of f-divergences. The variational JSD deﬁnition of
Equation (133) is implicit, while the deﬁnitions of Equations (134) and (135) are explicit
because the unique optimal centroid c∗= p+q
2
has been plugged into the objective function
that was minimized by Equation (133).
In this paper, we proposed a generalization of the Jensen-Shannon divergence based
on the variational deﬁnition of the ordinary Jensen-Shannon divergence based on the
variational JSD deﬁnition of Equation (133): DvJS[p : q] = minc 1
2(DKL[p : c] + DKL[q :
c]). We introduced the Jensen-Shannon symmetrization of an arbitrary divergence D by
considering a generalization of the information radius with respect to an abstract weighted
mean Mβ: DvJS
M [p : q] := minc Mβ(D[p : c], D[q : c]). Notice that, in the variational JSD,
the mean Mβ is used for averaging divergence values, while the mean Mα in the (Mα, Nβ)
JSD is used to deﬁne generic statistical mixtures. We also consider relative variational JS
symmetrization when the centroid has to belong to a prescribed family of densities. For
the case of exponential family, we showed how to compute the relative centroid in closed
form, thus extending the pioneering work of Sibson, who considered the relative normal
centroid used to calculate the relative normal information radius. Figure 2 illustrates the
three generalizations of the ordinary skewed Jensen-Shannon divergence. Notice that,
in general, the (M, N)-JSDs and the variational JDSs are not f-divergences (except in the
ordinary case).

Figure 2. Three equivalent expressions of the ordinary (skewed) Jensen-Shannon divergence which yield three differ-
ent generalizations.
In a similar vein, Chen et al. [80] considered the following minimax symmetrization
of the scalar Bregman divergence [81]:
Bminmax
f
(p, q)
:=
min
c
max
λ∈[0,1] λBf (p : c) + (1 −λ)Bf (q : c),
(136)
=
max
λ∈[0,1] λBf (p : λp + (1 −λ)q) + (1 −λ)Bf (q : λp + (1 −λ)),
(137)
=
λ f (p) + (1 −λ) f (q) −f (λp + (1 −λ))
(138)
where Bf denotes the scalar Bregman divergence induced by a strictly convex and smooth
function f:
Bf (p : q) = f (p) −f (q) −(p −q) f ′(q).
(139)
They proved that
q
Bminmax
f
(p, q) yields a metric when 3(log f ′′)′′ ≥((log f ′′)′)2, and ex-
tend the deﬁnition to the vector case and conjecture that the square-root metrization still
holds in the multivariate case. In a sense, this deﬁnition geometrically highlights the
notion of radius, since the minmax optimization amount to ﬁnd a smallest enclosing
ball enclosing [82] the source distributions. The circumcenter, also called the Chebyshev
center [83], is then the mid-distribution instead of the centroid for the information ra-
dius. The term "information radius” is well-suited to measure the distance between two
points for an arbitrary distance D. Indeed, the JS-symmetrization of D is deﬁned by
DJS[p : q] := minc{ 1
2 D[p : c] + 1
2 D[q : c]}. When D[p : q] = DE[p : q] = ∥p −q∥is the
Euclidean distance, we have c =
p+q
2 , and D[p : c] = D[q : c] = 1
2∥p −q∥=: r (i.e.,
the radius being half of the diameter ∥p −q∥). Thus, DJS
E [p : q] = r; hence, the term chosen
by Sibson [1] for DJS: information radius. Besides providing another viewpoint, varia-
tional deﬁnitions of divergences have proven to be useful in practice (e.g., for estimation).
For example, a variational deﬁnition of the Rényi divergence generalizing the Donsker–

Entropy 2021, 23, 464

Varadhan variational formula of the KLD is given in [84], which is used to estimate the
Rényi Divergences.
