T
Temperature
The phenomenological definition of temperature, T, is that it is a
parameter that governs the direction of flow of energy as heat through
a diathermic boundary: energy as heat flows from high to low tem-
perature. The thermodynamic definition of temperature originates in
the Zeroth law of thermodynamics as the parameter that determines
whether systems in contact through diathermic walls are in thermal
equilibrium. The molecular definition of temperature is that it is the
parameter in the Boltzmann distribution that determines the rela-
tive occupation of the available energy levels of any substance. There
is a further definition in terms of a combination of the properties
introduced by the laws of thermodynamics: if the internal energy,
U (as introduced by the First law) and entropy, S (as introduced by the
Second law), of a system are regarded as fundamental, being measures
of the quantity and quality of stored energy, respectively, then they de-
fine temperature (as introduced by the Zeroth law) through the relation

The formal definition of the thermodynamic temperature scale is in
terms of the eﬃciency, Z, of a heat engine working between a hot
source at a known temperature, Th, and a cold sink at the tempera-
ture, T, of interest, for then

The heat absorbed in a process can be assessed, in principle at least,
by comparing the work done between two states with the work done
in an adiabatic change between the same two states. Therefore, this
definition of a temperature scale in principle makes use only of
mechanical concepts (work). Setting Th equal to the triple point
temperature of water, 273.16 K, and noting that the lowest attainable
temperature is T ¼ 0, was the original definition of the Kelvin scale of
temperature; that definition has been superseded by one that makes
use of the defined values of fundamental constants. The Celsius scale
of temperature, in which temperatures are denoted y (so that T is
reserved for thermodynamic temperature) is defined in terms of the
Kelvin scale by the exact relation
y=1C ¼ T=K  273:15
Note that because Dy/8C ¼ DT/K, the size of the degree Celsius (8C) is
the same as the size of the kelvin (K). The Fahrenheit scale is defined
in terms of the Celsius scale and therefore the Kelvin scale by the
exact relations
y=1F ¼ 9
5 y=1C þ 32 ¼ 9
5 T=K  459:67
The Rankine scale is an absolute scale starting at T ¼ 0 in which the
size of the degree Rankine (8R) is the same as the degree Fahrenheit (8F),
and therefore
T=1R ¼ 9
5 T=K
Temperature Jump Technique
In the temperature jump technique, a reaction mixture is subjected to a
sharp rise in temperature and its return to the new equilibrium
composition is monitored. The relaxation time is interpreted in terms
of the rate constants (at the new temperature) of the forward and
reverse reactions.
Term
A spectroscopic term is the initial or final state (or group of states)
between which a transition occurs; in somewhat outmoded language,
two terms are said to ‘combine’ to account for a spectroscopic line.

A term is specified by its term symbol and often the configuration that
gives rise to the term. In atoms, a term consists of several levels la-
belled J split by spinorbit coupling, with each level consisting of
2J þ 1 states labelled MJ. For an atom, a term symbol has the form
Multiplicity!2Sþ1{L}MJ’State
J’Level
(The MJ label is commonly omitted.) Here, {L} is an upright uppercase
letter used to denote the total orbital angular momentum:
L

3
{L}
S
P
D
F
The notation continues G, H,. . .. The values of S, L, and J are obtained
for the configuration by coupling the angular momenta in accord with
the Russell–Saunders coupling scheme.
For linear molecules, a term has the form
Multiplicity!2Sþ1 L
f g’Reflection symmetry
g=u’Parity
where {L} is an upright Greek letter representing the component of
the orbital angular momentum around the internuclear axis:
L

{L}
S
P
D
F
The overall parity of the term (which is relevant only if the molecule has
a centre of inversion) is evaluated by using the rules g g¼ g,
g u¼ u, and u  u¼ g for all the electrons outside a closed shell. The
reflection label () is used only for S terms and indicates the overall
symmetry under reflection in a plane that includes the internuclear axis.
For nonlinear polyatomic molecules, the term symbol has the form
Multiplicity!2Sþ1Gg=u’Parity
where G is the symmetry species of the overall orbital electronic state;
once again, the parity designation is relevant only if the molecule has
a centre of inversion.

equilibrium at any given overall composition of the mixture. The term
is used in connection with fractional distillation, with the number of
theoretical plates for a succession of vaporizations and condensations
between an initial composition and a final composition (Figure T.1).
That number is a measure of the eﬃciency of the separation process.
Thermal Conduction
Thermal conduction is the transport of energy as heat down a tem-
perature gradient. The rate of transport is given by the following ex-
pression for the energy flux, J:
J ¼  k @T
@x


n
where k is the coeﬃcient of thermal conductivity and the constraint is
for constant composition. The kinetic theory of gases leads to the
following expression for the coeﬃcient when the molar concentration
of a gas is [J], its molar isochoric heat capacity is CV,m, the mean free
path is l, and the mean speed of its molecules is vmean:
k ¼ 1
3 lvmeanCV;m[ J]
Note that because l p 1/p and [ J] p p, k is independent of pressure:
although more molecules are present to transport energy at high
pressure, the distance over which they can do so is decreased.
Specifically, with l ¼ kT/sp and [ J] ¼ p/RT ¼ p/NAkT,
k ¼ vmeanCV;m

where s is the collision cross-section of the molecules.

Thermal Motion
Thermal motion is chaotic molecular motion; the higher the tem-
perature, the more energetic is the thermal motion.
Thermal Wavelength
The thermal wavelength, L, of a particle of mass m at a temperature
T is
L ¼

(2pmkT)1=2
The translational partition function, q, of a perfect gas in a container
of volume V is expressed in terms of the thermal wavelength by
q ¼ V

Many translational states are occupied when VcL3.
Thermochemistry
Thermochemistry is the branch of thermodynamics that deals with the
energy released or required as heat by a chemical reaction. See en-
thalpy of reaction and calorimeter.
Thermodynamic Force
The thermodynamic force, F m, is an eﬀective force acting as though there
is an influence to achieve the equalization of chemical potential
throughout the sample, although in fact that is simply a consequence of
the spontaneous tendency of matter to disperse. Formally, it is defined as
F m ¼ 

The units of thermodynamic force, a molar quantity, are newtons per
mole (N mol1).
Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is the branch of science concerned with the trans-
formations of energy. It is expressed in terms of four laws. See the
entry for each law.
Third Law of Thermodynamics
The phenomenological (observation-based) statement of the Third
law is:
It is impossible to reach T ¼ 0 in a finite number of cyclic steps.
The most succinct statement in terms of the entropy (a property
introduced by the Second law), which implies the phenomenological
statement, is:
The entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline substance is zero
at T ¼ 0.
The experimental foundation of the law is the Nernst heat theorem.
Its importance lies in the implication that it permits the identification
of the thermodynamic and statistical definitions of entropy.
Tie Line
A tie line in a phase diagram is a straight line connecting two phases
that are in equilibrium for a given overall composition of the system
(Figure T.2). See lever rule.

torr (the unit)
The torr (symbol: Torr) is a non-SI unit used to report pressure and
defined such that 760 Torr ¼ 1 atm exactly. It follows that 1 Torr E
133.32 Pa. See mmHg.
Transition Dipole Moment
The (electric) transition dipole moment for two states i and f, lfi, is
defined as
lfi ¼
ð
cf lcidt
It is a measure of the dipolar character of the shift in charge that oc-
curs during the transition. The transition is allowed if the transition
moment is nonzero and forbidden if it is zero. The conditions under
which the transition moment is nonzero are expressed by the selection
rules. The transition dipole moment is a vector with three components:
the nonvanishing components express the polarization of the electric
vector in the electromagnetic radiation that is absorbed or generated in
the transition.
Translational Motion
In nonrelativistic classical mechanics translational motion, the motion
of a particle of mass m through space, is described by its velocity, v, its
magnitude, its speed, v, and its linear momentum, p:
v ¼ dr
dt ;
v ¼ jvj;
p ¼ mv
Two further relations are the kinetic energy, Ek, and the acceleration,
a, the rate of change of velocity, in the presence of a force, F:
Ek ¼ 1
2 mv2 ¼ p2

that the motion is in the direction of k, and taking the complex
conjugate of the wavefunction corresponds to reversing the direction
of motion (Figure T.3):

Transport Number
The transport number, t, of an ion in solution (þ for cations,  for
anions) is the fraction of the total electric current, I, it carries through
the solution:
t ¼ I

The limiting transport number, t○

A transport property is the movement of a physical property through a
nonuniform system. The flux of the property, J, is commonly pro-
portional to the gradient of a related property, with

Triangular Phase Diagram
A triangular phase diagram is used to depict the phase equilibria of
ternary (three-component) systems at constant pressure and tem-
perature. Its interpretation is illustrated in Figure T.4. Note that for
any point in the interior of the triangle it follows from the geometry of

an equilateral triangle that xA þ xB þ xC ¼ 1 and that all points on a
straight line terminating at the corner A have B and C in the same
mole ratio, and likewise for the other two corners.
Triple Point
A triple point in a phase diagram is where three phases are in mutual
equilibrium (Figure T.5). For a system with a single component
(C ¼ 1), it is an invariant point (F ¼ C  P þ 2¼ 0; that is, the pressure
and temperature are unchangeable). One triple point of water, the one
involving ice-I (T3 ¼ 273.16 K, p3 ¼ 611.657 Pa), was used to define the
size of the kelvin, but it is now an experimentally determined point.
Trouton’s Rule
Trouton’s rule states that for most liquids, DvapH-/Tb is a constant
and equal to about 85 J K1 mol1. The exceptions include liquids in
which there is a significant amount of structural ordering (by
hydrogen bonding, for instance). The explanation of the rule is that
DvapH-/Tb is the standard entropy of vaporization, and there is a
similar change in the degree of disorder whenever an unstructured
liquid forms a vapour.
Tunnelling
Tunnelling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which a particle
is found in or passing through regions from which it is excluded
according to classical mechanics (where its kinetic energy would,
formally, be negative). The eﬀect arises from the fact that a wave-
function does not fall abruptly to zero at the walls of a container

unless the potential energy there is infinite, but decays in the region.
If the potential energy falls back to a low but nonzero level after a
finite distance, the wavefunction will have a nonzero amplitude and
therefore a nonzero probability of being found beyond the barrier
(Figure T.6).
For a rectangular potential energy barrier of height V and width L
the probability, P, that a particle of mass m will be found on the
far side of the barrier when it is incident on it from the left with
energy E is

When the barrier is high and wide in the sense that kLc1, then

PE16e(1  e)e2kL
In this case, the tunnelling probability decreases exponentially with
the height of the barrier and with the mass of the particle. Tunnelling
is very important for electrons, moderately important for protons
(which accounts for the rapid equilibration of proton transfer re-
actions), less important for deuterons, and not important in general
for heavier particles. See scanning tunnelling microscopy for one
application.
Two-dimensional NMR
In two-dimensional NMR, the spectrum is displayed along using two
axes to facilitate its interpretation. For example, in correlation spectro-
scopy (COSY) the pulse sequence 908(x)[delay t1]908(x)[acquisition t2] is
applied, followed by a double Fourier transform with respect to the two
time delays t1 and t2.
Two-level System
A two-level system, a system of only two states separated by energy e,
has simple but instructive thermodynamic properties which may be
expressed analytically by means of the molecular partition function.
