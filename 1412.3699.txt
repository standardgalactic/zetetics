Abstract
The subleading corrections to factorization theorems for soft bremsstrahlung in nonabelian
gauge theories and gravity are investigated in the case of a ﬁve point amplitude with four
scalars. Building on recent results, we write the action of the angular momentum operators
on scattering amplitudes as derivatives with respect to the Mandelstam invariants to uncover
a double copy structure in the contribution of the soft graviton to the amplitude, both in
the leading term and the ﬁrst correction. Using our approach, we study Gribov’s theorem
as extended to nonabelian gauge theories and gravity by Lipatov, and ﬁnd that subleading
corrections can be obtained from those to Low’s theorem by dropping the terms with derivatives
with respect to the center-of-mass energy, which are suppressed at high energies. In this case,
the emitted gravitons are not necessarily soft.

Introduction
The scattering amplitudes of quantum ﬁeld theories with massless intermediate gauge bosons
have an interesting infrared behavior, in particular in the soft limit where massless bosons are
emitted with very small momenta. In this context, it was proved by Low [1] that in QED the
leading behavior of an inelastic amplitude with an emitted soft photon is dominated by those
contributions in which the photon is bremsgestrahlt by the external states (Low formulated the
theorem for scalar charged particles, Burnett and Kroll generalized it to the case of charged
fermions [2]). Subleading corrections to this result, sensitive to internal emissions, were also
computed in [1] and found to have a particularly simple form. In the case of gravity, Weinberg
showed [3] that a similar result holds for scattering amplitudes in which a soft graviton is
emitted.
More recently, there has been a renewed interest in these results stemming from the real-
ization that Weinberg’s soft-graviton theorem can be regarded as the Ward identity associated
with the symmetries of the gravitational theory at null inﬁnity [4]. This has led to the for-
mulation of a new soft-graviton theorem including next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading
order corrections which have a universal expression in terms of the angular momentum of the
hard particles [5]. Using obvious notation,

is the angular momentum operator of the i-th particle. It has been argued that this result is not
renormalized [6, 7]. Generalizations of this new soft-graviton theorem to arbitrary dimensions
were studied in [8].
In the case of Yang-Mills theories, the subleading corrections to Low’s result can also be

encoded in terms of the angular momentum operator acting on the n-point amplitude [9, 10]:

In QED, the subleading corrections also admit an interpretation in terms of the asymptotic
symmetries of the theory at null inﬁnity [11].
Low’s theorem was originally derived in the limit in which the momentum of the photon is
taken to be very small, k →0. It was later realized by Gribov [12] that the expression found by
Low has a broader range of validity if the scattering takes place at a large center-of-mass energy
of the colliding particles, √s. In this case the factorization can also hold for hard emissions as
long as their transverse momentum with respect to the radiating particle is small compared to
the momentum transfers typical of the scattering process. Thus, for two colliding hadrons of
typical mass µ and momenta p and q, the amplitude is dominated by external bremsstrahlung
in the kinematic region deﬁned by
2 p · k, 2 q · k ≪s
k2
⊥≈(2 p · k)(2 q · k)
s
≪µ2,
(1.4)
with k⊥the transverse momentum of the photon. The main diﬀerence with respect to the
regime of validity of Low’s theorem (which applies in the region 2 p · k, 2 q · k ≪µ2) is that now
we assume a large center-of-mass energy √s ≫µ, without requiring the photon momentum to
be soft. The theorem was generalized by Lipatov in [13] to the case of a Yang-Mills ﬁeld or a
graviton coupled to scalars.
In this note we study the corrections to soft gluon and graviton theorems for amplitudes
containing scalar ﬁelds, and investigate the double copy structure of the latter one. In Section 2,
we generalize the analysis of [14] to the nonabelian case for the scattering amplitude of two
diﬀerent scalars with the emission of a gluon, showing that the ﬁrst correction to Low’s leading
result is completely ﬁxed by gauge invariance, as it happens in QED. Writing the action of
the angular momentum operators on the four scalars amplitude using derivatives with respect
to the Mandelstam s and t invariants, we ﬁnd that the amplitude has a particularly simple
form in terms of a set of gauge invariant coeﬃcients. Due to the Jacobi identity satisﬁed by
the color factors, these coeﬃcients admit shift transformations that preserve the value of the
amplitude and do play an important role when connecting the gauge theory amplitude to the
2

corresponding gravitational one. In Section 3 we analyze the gravitational scattering amplitude
of two scalars with the emission of a graviton in the soft limit. As in the gauge theory case, we
express the ﬁrst correction in terms of derivatives with respect to the Mandelstam invariants
and ﬁnd that the associated coeﬃcients have a double copy structure. This is interpreted in the
sense that the contribution of the soft graviton to the ﬁve-point gravitational amplitude can
be factored as the square of the contribution of the soft gluon to its gauge theory counterpart,
after removing the color factors. Section 4 is devoted to the study of the Gribov limit, which
allows for not necessarily soft bremsstrahlung, both in gauge theories and gravity. We ﬁnd that
the ﬁrst correction to the amplitude in this kinematic region computed in [13] can be obtained
from the corresponding correction to the Low/Weinberg theorems by dropping derivatives with
respect to the s Mandelstam invariant. Finally, in Section 5 we summarize our conclusions.

Soft gluons in scalar QCD
It has been shown in [14] that in scalar QED the ﬁrst subleading correction to Low’s theorem
is completely ﬁxed by gauge invariance. In this section we extend this result to the nonabelian
case by considering scalar QCD (sQCD) with two ﬂavors and the scattering amplitude of two
distinct scalars in an arbitrary representation with radiation of a gluon.
The ﬁve generic
topologies contributing to this process are shown in Fig. 1: four of them correspond to the
bremsstrahlung of a gluon by the external scalars, while in the ﬁfth one the gluon is emitted
from an internal propagator. Based on Lorentz and color covariance, the amplitude can be
written as

where Tij and eTmn are the gauge group generators associated with the two scalar ﬂavors. We
have also introduced the following kinematic invariants
s1 = 2 k · p,
s2 = 2 k · q,
s1′ = 2 k · p′,
s2′ = 2 k · q′.
(2.3)
The next step is to enforce gauge invariance. The gauge Ward identity reads,
c1 A4(p, q, p′ + k, q′) −c2 A4(p −k, q, p′, q′) + c4 A4(p, q, p′, q′ + k) −c5 A4(p, q −k, p′, q′)

(2.4)

In the soft limit we expand this equation in powers of the gluon momentum.
At leading
order in this expansion, the Ward identity is automatically satisﬁed due to the Jacobi identity
c1 −c2 +c4 −c5 = 0. In the linear approximation, on the other hand, we are led to the equation

(2.5)
To solve for the functions Bµ
i (0; p, q, p′, q′), we have to keep in mind that the color factors are
not independent. In fact, there are four independent Jacobi identities relating them,
c1 + c2 −c3 = 0,
c4 + c5 −c6 = 0,
(2.6)
c1 −c2 + c7 = 0,
c4 −c5 −c7 = 0,
which can be used to eliminate c1, c2, c4 and c5 in favor of c3, c6 and c7. Using these relations
in Eq. (2.5) we arrive at

= 0.
(2.7)
Since c3, c6 and c7 are independent, we arrive at the equations to obtain the three undetermined
functions that are solved by
Bµ

∂p′µ −∂A4

∂qµ .
To these solutions for Bµ
i (0; p, q, p′, q′) we could add a function ∆µ
i satisfying kµ∆µ
i = 0. How-
ever, its tensor structure implies that such a function must be at least linear in k and therefore
can be ignored at this order.

Having calculated the leading behavior of the functions associated with the internal emission
diagrams, we expand the ﬁve-point amplitude (2.1) to O(k0) and substitute the expressions
found in (2.8). Using the Jacobi identities to eliminate the color factors c3, c6, and c7 we have

We have shown that the ﬁrst correction to the amplitude in the soft limit is completely ﬁxed
by the requirement of gauge invariance. Compared to the scalar QED case analyzed in [14],
we have a larger number of unknown functions associated with the diﬀerent color structures in
the internal emission diagrams. However, this very fact implies that there is an equally larger
number of independent constraints to determine these functions. At linear order in the gluon
momentum, we have again three equations for the ﬁrst derivatives of Bi(k; p, q, p′, q′) at k = 0,
but as in the Abelian case these relations leave the curls

The corrections to Low’s theorem in Eq. (2.10) can be rewritten using the Mandelstam
invariants s and t, that we deﬁne in the following symmetric form

In this expression gauge invariance follows trivially from the invariance of the coeﬃcients
Ai and Bi. It is important to note that there exists a larger set of transformations of these
coeﬃcients that leaves the ﬁrst correction to Low’s theorem invariant. These are given by the
shifts

−→
B2 −s2 β(p, q, p′, q′),
where α(p, q, p′, q′) and β(p, q, p′, q′) are two arbitrary functions of the scalar momenta, not nec-
essarily local. Note that these transformations resemble those of the original color-kinematics
duality [17], although they are only aﬀecting the factorizing soft factors and not the full am-
plitude.
Moreover, we have not identiﬁed any relevant role for the Jacobi identities when
investigating the double copy structure in the gravitational case. This is likely to be a feature
of the soft limit alone.

The gravitational amplitude and its double copy struc-
ture
The amplitude for the scattering of two distinct scalars with emission of a graviton can be
computed in the soft limit by considering the ﬁve generic topologies shown in Fig. 1 with the

gluon replaced by a graviton. Following the general arguments given in [14], the result is

Similarly to the gauge theory case, the gravitational amplitude also remains invariant under
the following generalized transformations of the coeﬃcients (with i = 1, 1′, 2, 2′):

Here, to simplify the notation, we have introduced the invariants

This transformation is interesting because if we compare the new set of coeﬃcients with the

Thus, up to a common kinematic denominator and a phase (which can be absorbed in a
redeﬁnition of the Bi’s), the coeﬃcients of the gravity amplitude can be written as a double
copy of the ones of the gauge theory. This structure is manifest if we rewrite the scalar amplitude

We have used momentum conservation s1 + s2 = s1′ + s2′.
Some remarks on the expressions (3.14) and (3.15) are in order. Factoring out s1 + s2 and
t1 −t2 might seem a mere analytic trick to get the double copy to work better. However, this
way of writing the amplitudes is quite natural once we take into account that these two terms
are the expansion parameters in the soft limit around s and t, so the double copy representation
12

aﬀects the coeﬃcients of the series expansion around the k = 0 term. Written in this way, it
is clear how the contribution of the soft graviton to the ﬁve-point amplitude can be obtained
by replacing the color factors in the gauge amplitude with a second copy of the corresponding
kinetic coeﬃcient. This prescription works not only for the correction but for the leading term
as well, where the kinematic coeﬃcient is just the momentum.
We should also stress the importance of using derivatives with respect to the kinematic
invariants in uncovering the double copy structure of the subleading corrections in the soft limit.
In this case, the tensor structure of the amplitude is completely codiﬁed in the coeﬃcients of
these derivatives, in which the double copy is glaring. Expressing the amplitude in terms of
derivatives with respect to the momenta obscures this feature.
4
Gribov’s limit
We have considered so far amplitudes in the standard soft gluon and graviton regimes, as well
as their ﬁrst corrections. As explained in the Introduction, Gribov found that Low’s result is
valid in a kinematic region larger than the strict kµ →0 limit. In our notation this is given by
s1, s2 ≪s,
k2
⊥≪µ2 ≪s,
(4.1)
with µ the mass of the scalars. Moreover, in this limit it is also satisﬁed [12]
|t1 −t2| ≪µ√−t1 ≈µ√−t2.
(4.2)
It is remarkable that in this region the associated radiation can be hard, i.e., we are not
just limited to emission of soft particles. Gribov’s result was extended in [13] to the scattering
amplitude of two scalar ﬂavors in nonabelian gauge theories in the high energy limit s ≫t ∼µ2.
This inequality has important consequences for the form of the amplitude. Since the four-scalar
amplitude A4(s, t) is dimensionless, it has to be a homogeneous function of degree zero of its
two arguments. This means that in this kinematic regime, derivatives with respect to s are
much smaller than the derivatives with respect to t, due to a suppression factor t/s:

(4.3)

As a consequence, writing Eq. (2.1) in terms of the kinematic invariants, the momentum shifts
in the expression only aﬀect the second argument of A(s, t), i.e.,

Again, to determine the unknown functions associated with internal gluon emission we write
the gauge Ward identity and take into account that in our kinematic regime
t1 −t2

≡t.
(4.5)
Then, we expand the expression to ﬁrst order in t1 −t2. Since this parameter is proportional to
k, the leading contribution of the functions Bµ
i (k; p, q, p′, q′) to the Ward identity comes from
setting k = 0 in the argument. Proceeding as in Section 2, we ﬁnd that gauge invariance ﬁxes
the unknown functions and the result of [13] is recovered in a slightly diﬀerent notation:

(4.6)
A similar calculation can be carried out for the gravitational amplitude. The only caveat
lies in whether we can neglect derivatives with respect to s, since now due to the dimensionful
coupling κ it is no longer true that the amplitude is a function of s/t. Nevertheless, at a ﬁxed
order in perturbation theory the amplitude has the generic form
M4(s, t) = (κ2s)
n

(4.7)
However, if at large energies f(s/t) ∼(s/t)α, the s-derivative of M4(s, t) is suppressed with
respect to its t-derivatives by a power of t/s. This is indeed the case of the tree-level amplitude
(with α = 1), so we can take the amplitude as constant with respect to s and retrieve the
14

We see how Gribov’s limit of the gauge and gravitational scattering amplitudes (4.6) and (4.8)
can be respectively obtained from our expressions for the corrections to the Low and Weinberg
limits (2.16) and (3.5) by just ignoring derivatives with respect to s.

Concluding remarks
The idea of the existence of a double copy representation of gravity has received strong support,
ranging from KLT identities [16] to color-kinematics duality [17] (see [18] for a recent review).
In the context of the soft limit, it was found in [19] that the infrared behavior of both gauge
theories and gravity is consistent with an underlying double copy provided by color-kinematics
duality to all orders in perturbation theory.
In this paper we have studied the double copy structure in the context of the soft gluon
and graviton theorems. Our analysis shows clear evidence that there is a sense in which we
can state that (soft graviton) = (soft gluon)2: the contribution of a soft graviton in a scalar
scattering amplitude can be written as the double copy of the corresponding contribution of a
soft gluon.
Let us try to be more precise. Our proposal strongly resembles color-kinematics duality of
gauge theory amplitudes, in which the gravity amplitude is obtained by replacing color factors
by a second copy of a kinematic factor. It has however the peculiarity that it does not aﬀect
the whole ﬁve-point amplitude, but just the coeﬃcients of the operator acting on the amplitude
of the four hard particles. The rationale behind this is that it is this prefactor which contains
all the information about the emitted gluon/graviton. This is precisely the sense of the moral
equation (soft graviton)=(soft gluon)2.
Interestingly, in the case of the scalar QCD ﬁve-point amplitude studied here, it was shown
in [20] that a naive application of color-kinematics duality does not render the full gravitational
15

amplitude for graviton emission. Even in multi-Regge kinematics, the full graviton amplitude
does not factorize in terms of two QCD eﬀective gluon vertices (Lipatov vertices), due to an
extra term which is necessary for the cancellation of overlapping divergences [15]. Despite this,
here we have seen how a certain double copy structure does indeed survive in the Low/Weinberg
and Gribov limits, but that this only aﬀects the soft graviton. Incidentally, the soft graviton
limit does not contain overlapping divergences, so the oﬀending term breaking factorization
in the Regge limit does not contribute to it.
Let us remark that by going to the Gribov
limit it is possible to escape from the soft graviton condition and extend Low’s factorization
to the emission of harder radiation. This is likely to have non-trivial consequences for the
interpretation of the Gribov limit in terms of symmetries in a gravitational theory at null
inﬁnity.
The scalar QCD theory used here admits modiﬁcations for which the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson
prescription in a general kinematics works [21]. One of them consists in taking all scalars to
transform in the adjoint representation and adding a quartic contact self-coupling between the
two ﬂavors. Nevertheless, this modiﬁcation does not spoil the double copy structure of the sub-
leading terms, since the new diagrams only add to the leading soft behavior. This is because
the new couplings are contact terms, so they only contribute to the sector with zero angular
momentum for which the correction vanishes.
There are a number of related questions that deserve attention. One of them concerns the
generalization of our result to other amplitudes and theories at tree and loop level (e.g., is
there a hidden double copy interpretation of the double logarithms studied in [22]?). In this
sense, as already stated in Section 3, the use of derivatives with respect to invariants seems
crucial to expose the double copy structure in the amplitude. This is an added complication
when investigating higher-point amplitudes.
Another interesting problem to address is the
implications of our results for the possible relation between the asymptotic symmetries of gauge
theories [11, 23] and gravity [4]. These and other issues will be studied elsewhere.
