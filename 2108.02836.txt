Discussion on “Bayesian Regression Tree
Models for Causal Inference: Regularization,
Confounding, and Heterogeneous Eﬀects” by
Hahn, Murray and Carvalho∗
Liangyuan Hu†
Congratulations to Hahn, Murray and Carvalho on a nice contribution. The authors pro-
pose the Bayesian causal forest (BCF) model. It reduces the bias and improves frequen-
tist coverage of Bayesian credible intervals of treatment eﬀect estimates in the presence
of strong confounding and treatment eﬀect heterogeneity. The BCF model builds upon
the popular and empirically proven prediction method, Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART) (Chipman et al., 2010). BCF reformulates the response surface model
as the sum of two functions, one modeling the prognostic impact of the control vari-
ables and one representing the treatment eﬀect. This formulation directly incorporates
estimates of the propensity score (PS) which induces a covariate-dependent prior on
the regression function and regularizes treatment eﬀect heterogeneity separately from
the prognostic eﬀect of control variables. It is impressive that the proposed method,
in many settings, has better bias reduction, more consistent 95% coverage probability
and shorter uncertainty intervals compared to the vanilla BART, which boasts bet-
ter performance in a host of modern causal inference studies, including Hill (2011),
Wendling et al. (2018), Dorie et al. (2019) and Hu et al. (2020), to name a few.
This paper oﬀers an extensive study to explicate and evaluate the performance of
the BCF model in diﬀerent settings and provides a detailed discussion about its utility
in causal inference. It is a welcomed addition to the causal machine learning literature.
I will emphasize the contribution of the BCF model to the ﬁeld of causal inference
through discussions on two topics: 1) the diﬀerence between the PS in the BCF model
and the Bayesian PS in a Bayesian updating approach, 2) an alternative exposition of
the role of the PS in outcome modeling based methods for the estimation of causal
eﬀects. I will conclude with comments on avenues for future research involving BCF
that will be important and much needed in the era of Big data.

Distinction from the Bayesian propensity scores
It is necessary to make a distinction between incorporating the estimated PSs as a
covariate in the BCF model and combining so called “Bayesian propensity scores” and
Bayesian inference for the estimation of causal eﬀects in a single Bayesian updating

approach (Zigler et al., 2013; Zigler and Dominici, 2014). The Bayesian PS has received
recent attention in the literature (Kaplan and Chen, 2012; Zigler, 2016; Liao and Zigler,
2020). In essence, a series of work have demonstrated that the model feedback, i.e., the
propagation of information from the outcome model to the PS model, would distort
inferences about the causal eﬀect. In the BCF model, the independent BART prior is
placed over f, f ∼BART(X, Z, ˆπ), where ˆπ is the estimated PS and included as one of
the splitting dimensions. The ˆπ is included in the BCF model as an additional covariate
for splitting and is not updated or contaminated by the outcome information, thereby
setting BCF free from the inference issue caused by the Bayesian model feedback.

The role of the propensity score: connections to the
confounding function
I now turn to exposing the role of the PS in reducing the bias in the estimates of
causal eﬀects under targeted selection. The inclusion of the PS as a covariate in the
response model is closely connected to the confounding function approach (Robins,
1999), designed for removing the bias due to unmeasured confounding from the treat-
ment eﬀect estimates. The targeted selection described in Hahn et al. (2020) suggests
that the treatment assignment probability π(x) depends on µ(x) = E(Y |Z = 0, x).
Using Figure 4 as an example to illustrate, individuals who would have higher outcomes
without treatment are more likely to be treated. In another word, treated individuals
would have higher (potential) outcomes than untreated individuals to no treatment.
This is a violation of the ignorability assumption. To see why, deﬁne a confounding
function as c(z, x) = E(Y (z)|Z = 1, X = x) −E(Y (z)|Z = 0, X = x), z ∈{0, 1}.
When ignorability holds, c(z, x) = 0 for z = 0 and z = 1. When ignorability is violated,
such as in the presence of targeted selection, c(0, x) > 0. The violation of ignorability
gives rise to biased estimates of the causal eﬀects. An unbiased eﬀect estimate can be
obtained by “correcting” the observed outcome for unmeasured confounding, namely,
Y −[E(Y (z)|Z = z, x) −E(Y (z)|x)] (Robins, 1999; Brumback et al., 2004). Applying
the law of total expectation to E(Y (z)|x) yields a “corrected” outcome,
Y C = Y −{(1 −π(x))z −π(x)(1 −z)}c(z, x), z ∈{0, 1}.
(2.1)
Diﬀerencing the conditional expectations of Y C between the treated and untreated
individuals gives an unbiased eﬀect estimate, E(Y C|X = x, Z = 1) −E(Y C|X =
x, Z = 0). In equation (2.1), c(z, x) is a user-supplied prior distribution (a range of
values in frequentist approaches) representing our beliefs about the degree of ignorability
violation, or, targeted selection (Hogan et al., 2014). We see that the PS, π(x), is an
integral part in the outcome for causal modeling when there is a need to remove the
bias attributable to targeted selection. Relating to the inclusion of ˆπ in the BCF model,
the c(z, x) can be deemed as characterizing how big of a role the PS plays in the
estimation of causal eﬀects. With strong targeted selection, c(z, x) would deviate from
zero substantially, then ˆπ is important for bias reduction. In the absence of targeted
selection, c(z, x) would be close to zero, and the role of ˆπ is diminished.

Final thought on possible extensions
My ﬁnal thought is about extending the BCF model to meet the emerging methodolog-
ical needs, particularly in the Biostatistical research. First, a common causal estimand
of interest is the average treatment eﬀect on the treated (ATT). The BCF model does
not seem to be readily implementable for the ATT estimation. Although, the idea of
ps-BART can be easily applied to estimate the ATT eﬀect. Second, in the era of Big
data, given the wealth of information captured in large-scale data, it is rare that treat-
ment regimens are deﬁned in terms of two treatments only. Reﬁned causal inference
approaches are in great demand for the multiple treatment settings. Hu et al. (2020)
investigated the operating characteristics of several machine learning based causal infer-
ence techniques in the multiple treatment setting, and found that BART-based methods
generally had the best performance. It would be a useful addition to the causal machine
learning literature if the BCF model can be extended to simultaneously compare more
than two active treatments.
