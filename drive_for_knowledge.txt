THE DRIVE FOR KNOWLEDGE
Humans constantly search for and use information to solve a wide
range of problems related to survival, social interactions, and learning.
While it is clear that curiosity and the drive for knowledge occupies
a central role in deﬁning what being human means to ourselves, where
does this desire to know the unknown come from? What is its
purpose? And how does it operate? These are some of the core
questions this book seeks to answer by showcasing new and exciting
research on human information-seeking. The volume brings together
perspectives from leading researchers at the cutting edge of the
cognitive sciences, working on human brains and behavior within
psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. These vital connec-
tions between disciplines will continue to lead to further break-
throughs in our understanding of human cognition.
