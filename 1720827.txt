 Galactic Depolarization of the
 21-Centimeter-Wavelength Radiation
 of Extragalactic Sources
 Abstract. The dependence of the de-
 gree of linear polarization of the radia-
 tion from 213 extragalactic sources on
 galactic coordinates was investigated at
 2.1-centimeter wavelength. In addition
 to the previously known latitude effect,
 the depolarization of the radiation dur-
 ing transit through our galaxy is also a
 function of galactic longitude. One pos-
 sible explanation is that galactic de-
 polarization is a simple function of the
 distance traveled by the radiation
 through an extended galactic halo.
 Observations at wavelengths near 21
 cm have shown that the radiation from
 extragalactic sources located in direc-
 tions of low galactic latitude is meas-
 urably depolarized during its passage
 through our galaxy (1, 2). In addition,
 internal depolarization is believed to
 take place in the sources themselves.
 The galactic depolarization may be
 caused by differential Faraday rotation
 across the angular extent of the source
 as a -result of differences in the inter-
 stellar magnetic field, or electron den-
 sity, or both, occurring over distances
 of the order of 1 parsec or less (1).
 Polarization results are now available
 for a larger sample of extragalactic
 sources, and our results indicate that
 the depolarization is a function of ga-
 lactic longitude as well as latitude, with
 the amount of depolarization tending
 to increase as the direction to a source
 approaches the direction of the galactic
 center.
 During August and September 1964,
 we measured the effective linear polari-
 zations of 76 additional sources at 21.2-
 cm wavelength with the 300-foot
 (91.4-m) transit radio telescope of the
 National Radio Astronomy Observa-
 1656
 tory at Green Bank, West Virginia.
 These observations were a continuation
 of measurements made with the same
 telescope and receivers in 1963 (1).
 Two identical receivers were connected
 to orthogonal, linearly polarized outputs
 of a circular wave guide feed antenna
 mounted at the focus of the reflector.
 The orientations of the planes of po-
 larization accepted by the receivers
 could be varied by rotating the feed
 antenna. The equipment and methods
 of observation have been described in
 detail (1). Both the 1963 and 1964
 observations were confined to small-di-
 ameter (average < 1') sources of non-
 thermal spectra selected primarily from
 the 3C catalog (3). Sources for
 which the data indicate that polarized
 foreground radiation from our galaxy
 may introduce appreciable errors were
 eliminated, leaving a total of 134 pre-
 sumably extragalactic sources meas-
 ured at 21.2-cm wavelength with the
 300-foot telescope. The estimated un.-
 certainties in the degrees of polariz a-
 tion average about 1 percent standard
 error. We have combined our data with
 the results of other observers to give
 the linear polarizations of 213 extra-
 galactic sources at 21-cm wavelength,
 and have analyzed these data for a
 dependence on galactic longitude as
 well as latitude. We have included the
 results from the Owen's Valley Radio
 Observatory as given by Morris and
 Berge (4), and the results of Bolton,
 Gardner, and Mackey; Gardner and
 Davies; and Gardner from the Parkes
 catalog of radio sources (5, 6).

 longitude range 90? < e 1 ? 270? and
 solid circles represent sources in the

 < f11 ? Oo.
 The degrees of linear polarization of
 the 21 3 sources are plotted as a func-
 tion of the absolute value of the sine
 of the galactic latitude in Fig. 1.
 The open circles represent sources in
 the 1800 range of galactic longitudes
 on the galactic anticenter side of Earth,
 and the solid circles represent sources
 in the hemisphere centered on the
 galactic center side of Earth. The
 sample contains 93 sources on the
 galactic center side in longitude and
 120 sources on the anticenter side. Fig-
 ure 1 indicates that sources at low lati-
 tudes tend to be less strongly polar-
 ized than sources at high latitudes;
 this finding confirms the latitude de-
 pendence found previously (1). How-
 ever, the present larger sample shows
 that the effect is especially pronounced
 for sources having longitudes on the
 galactic center side of Earth. Figure
 1 shows that almost all the sources
 of low galactic latitude (less than 150)
 that are appreciably polarized are on
 the galactic anticenter side of Earth,
 where the distances traveled by the
 radiation through our galaxy are rela-
 tively short. The chi-square test ap-
 plied to the distribution of polarization
 versus latitude for 'the data represented
 by the open circles in Fig. 1, or ap-
 plied to the data represented by the
 solid circles, or applied to all the
 data combined, gives in each case prob-
 abilities of less than 5 percent that the
 distributions of polarizations are in-
 trinsically the same for high and low
 latitude sources.
 Figure 2 is a plot of degree of polar-
 ization versus galactic longitude for
 each of the 213 sources. The sources
 of the sample having absolute values
 of latitude equal to or less than 15?
 are represented by solid circles, and
 the sources of absolute latitude greater
 than 150 are represented by open cir-
 cles. Figure 2 again illustrates that
 most low latitude sources in the 180?
 range of longitudes toward the galactic
 center are not appreciably polarized,
 while about one-third of the low lati-
 tude sources on the anticenter side
 show appreciable polarization. The chi-
 square test gives a probability of about
 6 percent that the apparent difference
 in the polarization distributions for the
 low latitude sources is due to random
 sampling.
 One possible interpretation of the
 data is that the depolarization is a di-
 rect function of the length of the path
 traveled by the radiation through the
 galaxy. In this case, if the depolariza-

 ionized gas will extend to a height of
 5000 parsecs above the galactic plane
 (8).
 Figure 3 is a plot of the degrees of
 polarization versus the ratios of the
 semimajor axis, R, to the path lengths,
 D, through a corona of this extent. We
 have represented the corona by an ob-
 late spheroid having a semiminor axis,
 Z, of 5000 parsecs and a semimajor
 axis, R, of 15,000 parsecs, with Earth
 situated in the central plane 10,000 par-
 secs from the center. Figure 3 shows
 that sources for which the path lengths,
 D. in this model are long tend to be
 less strongly polarized than sources for
 which the path lengths are relatively
 short. The chi-square test gives a prob-
 ability of only 3 percent that the dis-
 tributions of polarization for sources
 of short and long path lengths in this
 model are intrinsically the same. It is
 probable that the explanation of galac-
 tic depolarization is not as simple as
 that suggested by the model used for
 Fig. 3, and-other, very different mod-
 els may also be consistent with the
 data. However, the fact that this sim-
 ple model serves to relate degree of
 polarization and galactic coordinates
 gives strong evidence that galactic de-
 polarization is a function of galactic
 longitude as well as latitude.
 It can be shown (1) that galactic
 depolarization at 21 cm can be ex-
 plained by variations in the interstellar
 magnetic field or by electron density,
 or both, with scales of the order of I
 parsec or less. The available polariza-
 tion data appear to be consistent. with
 a component of interstellar magnetic
 field with small-scale reversals of direc-
 tion, or effectively closed loops, super-
 imposed on a fairly uniform field.
 The average total Faraday rotation at
 21-cm wavelength is only of the order
 of 4 radiant at low latitudes and varies
 /slowly with galactic coordinates (9),
 while depolarization requires differen-
 tial Faraday rotations of roughly 2 or
 3 radians over the very small angular
 diameters of most of the sources.

 Crystal Structure of Amylose
 Triacetate: A Nonintegral Helix
 Abstract. The x-ray diffraction diagram of an oriented fiber of amylose tri-
 acetate I, presenting evidence for a nonintegral helical structure, was analyzed
 by a model and by Fourier transform calculation. The results suggest a helical
 structure with 4.67 + 0.02 residues per one turn of the helix, which appears
 to be left-handed.
 In studying x-ray diffraction diagram
 of amylose triacetate, whose crystalline
 form was first observed by Whistler
 and Schieltz (1), we noted evidence of
 helical conformation of the polymer
 chain. As fiber diagrams usually contain
 a minimum of information regarding
 the structure of the polymer, this indi-
 cation presented an attractive starting
 point for an attempt to solve the crystal
 structure of amylose triacetate.
 Amylose, the linear polymer of a-i,
 4-D-glucose which occurs in starch, is
 easily acetylated by means of a non-
 degradative procedure (2). The triace-

 tate can be cast into a film from
 chloroform solution. The film is partly
 crystalline and may be oriented by
 stretching in glycerol at 1 60'C to an
 extension of at least 500 percent (1).
 An x-ray diffraction diagram of this
 structure, termed amylose triacetate I,
 taken with CuKa radiation on flat film
 with the x-ray beam perpendicular to
 the surface of the film (Fig. 1), indi-
 cates a high degree of parallel orien-
 tation of the crystallites and shows the
 typical features of scattering from a
 helical structure: an x-shaped distribu-
 tion of intensities about the center of
 the diagram and a single strong reflec-
 tion on the equator, suggestive of hex-
 agonal close packing. Some degree of
 translational disorder in the structure
 is indicated by streaking of reflections
 on layer lines other than the equator.
 The lack of streaking on the equator
 shows the absence of variation in the
 lateral distance between the chains.
 Quantitative appraisal of this dia-
 grarm, as well as of others taken with the
 sample inclined with respect to the pri-
 mary x-ray beam, showed the follow-
 ing: (i) the packing of chains is in-
 deed hexagonal, with the lateral distance
 between chains 10.87 A; (ii) although
 all reflections fall on clearly resolved
 layer lines, the separation of layers
 in reciprocal space is not constant and
 cannot be accounted for with a single
 fiber repeat (Fig. 2A); (iii) there is
 only one meridional reflection present.
 These data indicate that the amylose
 triacetate chain is helical and that
 the helix is nonintegral; that is, within
 one turn of the helix there is no struc-
 tural repeat. The advance (axial thrust)
 per turn is 17.6 ? 0.2 A, as obtained
 from the first-layer line spacing, and
 the advance per residue is 3.64 + 0.06
 A, as obtained from the meridional re-
 flection. The ratio 17.6/3.64 indicates
 that the number of residues per turn
 of the helix is in the vicinity of
 4.8 to 4.9.
 Scale models of such a helix were
 constructed for both the left-handed
 (3) and the right-handed case (the
 handedness of the helix could not be
 determined from the x-ray diagram),
 and both conformations proved stereo-
 chemically sound, although the left-
 handed helix seemed more probable
 on the basis of better cylindrical sym-
 metry and a higher degree of com-
 pactness.
 The essential agreement between the
 scale models and the above interpreta-
 tion of the fiber diagram prompted a
 more quantitative examination of the
 proposed structure, as the monomers-
 per-turn ratio was still approximate and
 the handedness of the helix could not
 be determined from the scale models
 only. This examination took the form
 of the calculation of Fourier (or molec-
 ular) transforms. Since the molecular
 transform is essentially the diffraction
 diagram of one molecule, it is of value
 in a quick comparison of the scattering
 from an assumed molecular conforma-
 tion and the observed diffraction dia-
 gram. The calculation of molecular
 transforms for helical structures is rel-
 atively easy, as one needs only the
 cylindrical coordinates of the atoms
 of one asymmetric unit of the helix
 (in most instances one monomer resi-
 due) and not the relative positions of
 the atoms with respect to the crystal-
 lographic unit cell, as required by the
 ordinary structure factor calculations.
 The intensity, I, at any point in the
 helix transform is given by the follow-
 ing expression (4):
 IocP (1)
 F(R, Ap, T) = TfjJ.(27rrjR) X
 n j
 exp [i{n(. - aj + 7r/2) + 27rz(}] (2)
 where F(R, ', C) is the Fourier trans-
 form at a point in reciprocal space
 with cylindrical coordinates R. Ifr, C;
 rj, 0j, zj are the cylindrical coordinates
 of the jth atom; J,, (27rrjR) is the nth-
 order Bessel function (whose value is
 determined by the argument in paren-
 thegses); and tj is the scattering factor
 for the jth atom.
 The calculation of the above trans-
 form is facilitated by casting it in the
