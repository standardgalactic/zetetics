Preface 
The group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms Ham(M, 0) of a symplectic mani-
fold (M, 0) plays a fundamental role both in geometry and classical mechanics. 
For a geometer, at least under some assumptions on the manifold M, this is 
just the connected component of the identity in the group of all symplectic 
diffeomorphisms. From the viewpoint of mechanics, Ham(M,O) is the group 
of all admissible motions. What is the minimal amount of energy required 
in order to generate a given Hamiltonian diffeomorphism I? An attempt to 
formalize and answer this natural question has led H. Hofer [HI] (1990) to a 
remarkable discovery. It turns out that the solution of this variational problem 
can be interpreted as a geometric quantity, namely as the distance between 
I and the identity transformation. Moreover this distance is associated to a 
canonical biinvariant metric on Ham(M, 0). Since Hofer's work this new ge-
ometry has been intensively studied in the framework of modern symplectic 
topology. In the present book I will describe some of these developments. 
Hofer's geometry enables us to study various notions and problems which 
come from the familiar finite dimensional geometry in the context of the group 
of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. They turn out to be very different from the 
usual circle of problems considered in symplectic topology and thus extend 
significantly our vision of the symplectic world. Is the diameter of Ham(M, 0) 
finite or infinite? What are the minimal geodesics? How can one find the length 
spectrum? In general, these questions are still open. However some partial 
answers do exist and will be discussed below. 
There is one more, to my taste even more important reason why it is useful 
to have a canonical geometry on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. 
Consider a time dependent vector field ~t, t E IR on a manifold M. The ordinary 
differential equation 
i; = ~(x, t) 
on M defines a flow It : M -+ M which takes any initial condition x(O) to 
the solution x(t) at time t. The trajectories of the flow form a complicated 
system of curves on the manifold. Usually, in order to understand the dynam-
ics, one should travel along the manifold and thoroughly study behaviour of 

x 
Preface 
the trajectories in different regions. Let us change the point of view and note 
that our flow can be interpreted as a simple geometric object - a single curve 
t ----+ ft on the group of all diffeomorphisms of the manifold. One may hope that 
geometric properties of this curve reflect the dynamics, and thus complicated 
dynamical phenomena can be studied by purely geometric tools. Of course, 
the price we pay is that the ambient space - the group of diffeomorphisms - is 
infinite-dimensional. Moreover, we face a serious difficulty: in general there are 
no canonical tools to perform geometric measurements on this group. Remark-
ably, Hofer's metric provides such a tool for systems of classical mechanics. In 
Chapters 8 and 11 we will see some situations where this ideology turns out 
to be successful. 
As it often happens with very young and fast developing areas of mathe-
matics, the proofs of various elegant statements in Hofer's geometry are tech-
nical and complicated. Thus I selected the simplest non-trivial versions of the 
main phenomena (according to my taste, of course) without making an attempt 
to present them in the most general form. For the same reason many techni-
calities are omitted. Though formally speaking this book does not require a 
special background in symplectic topology (at least necessary definitions and 
formulations are given), the reader is cordially invited to consult two remark-
able introductory texts [HZ] and [MS]. Both of them contain chapters on the 
geometry of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. I have tried to mini-
mize the overlaps. The book contains a number of exercises which presumably 
will help the reader to get into the subject. 
This book arose from two sources. The first one is lectures given to grad-
uate students, namely mini-courses at Universities of Freiburg and Warwick, 
and a Nachdiplom-course at ETH, Zurich. The second source is the expository 
article [P8] which contains a brief outline of the material presented below. 
Let me introduce briefly the main characters of the book. A diffeomor-
phism f of a symplectic manifold (M,O) is called Hamiltonian if it can be 
included into a compactly supported Hamiltonian flow {fd with fo = :n and 
!1 = f· Such a flow is defined by a Hamiltonian function F : M x [0; 1] ----+ R 
In the language of classical mechanics F is the energy of a mechanical motion 
described by {fd. We interpret the total energy of the flow as a length of the 
corresponding path of diffeomorphisms: 
length{ft} = r
1 maxF(x, t) - min F(x, t)dt.

p(¢,'ljJ) = inflength{ft},

where the infimum is taken over all Hamiltonian flows {ft} which generate the 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphism I = ¢ytjJ-l. It is easy to see that p is non-negative, 
symmetric, vanishes on the diagonal and satisfies the triangle inequality. More-
over, p is biinvariant with respect to the group structure of Ham(M, 0). In 
other words, p is a biinvariant pseudo-distance. It is a deep fact that p is a 
genuine distance function, that is p( <jJ, 'lj;) is strictly positive for <jJ =1= 'lj;. The 
metric p is called Hofer's metric. 
The group Ham(M,O) and Hofer's pseudo-distance p are introduced in 
Chapters 1 and 2 respectively. In Chapter 3 we prove that p is a genuine metric 
in the case when M is the standard symplectic linear space JR2n. Our approach 
is based on Gromov's theory of holomorphic discs with Lagrangian boundary 
conditions which is presented in Chapter 4. 
Afterwards we turn to the study of basic geometric invariants of 
Ham(M, 0). There is a (still open!) conjecture that the diameter of Ham(M, 0) 
is infinite. In Chapters 5-7 we prove this conjecture for closed surfaces. 
In Chapter 8 we discuss the concept of the growth of a one-parameter 
subgroup {ft} of Ham(M, 0) which reflects the asymptotic behaviour of the 
function p(:ll, It) when t ----+ 00. We present a link between the growth and the 
dynamics of {fd in the context of invariant tori of classicai mechanics. 
In many interesting situations the space Ham(M,O) has complicated 
topology, and in particular a non-trivial fundamental group. For an element 
'Y E 1l"l(Ham(M,O)) set lib) = inflength{lt}, where the infimum is taken over 
all loops {ft} of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms (that is periodic Hamiltonian 
flows) which represent 'Y. The set 
{lib) I 'Y E 1l"l(Ham(M, O))} 
is called the length spectrum of Ham(M, 0). In Chapter 9 we present an ap-
proach to the length spectrum which is based on the theory of symplectic 
fibrations. An important ingredient of this approach is Gromov's theory of 
pseudo-holomorphic curves which is discussed in Chapter 10. In Chapter 11 
we give an application of our results on the length spectrum to the classical 
ergodic theory. 
In Chapters 12 and 13 we develop two different approaches to the theory 
of geodesics on Ham(M, 0). One of them is elementary, while the other requires 
a powerful machinery of Floer homology. Chapter 13 suggests to the reader a 
brief visit to Floer homology. 
Finally, in Chapter 14 we deal with non-Hamiltonian symplectic dif-
feomorphisms, which appear naturally in Hofer's geometry as isometries of 
Ham(M, 0). In addition, we formulate and discuss the famous flux conjecture 
which states that the group Ham(M, 0) is closed in the group of all symplectic 
diffeomorphisms endowed with the COO-topology.

Chapter 1 
Introducing the Group 
In this chapter we sum up some well-known preliminary facts about the group 
of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. 
1.1 
The origins of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
Consider the motion of a mass 1 particle in Rn(q), where q denotes the coor-
dinate on Rn, in the presence of a potential force <I> (q, t) = -
~~ (q, t). N ew-
ton's second law yields ij = <I>(q, t). In general there is no chance to solve this 
equation explicitly except for some rare examples. However it is possible to 
understand some qualitative properties. 
Let us make a little trick. Introduce an auxiliary variable p = q, and 
2 
consider the function F(p, q, t) = y + U(q, t). The function F represents the 
total energy of the particle (the sum of the kinetic and the potential energies). 
With this notation the Newton equation above can be rewritten as follows: 
p = -~~(p,q,t) 
{ q= ~;(p,q,t). 
This system of the first order differential equations is called Hamiltonian sys-
tem. It should be considered as a differential equation in the 2n-dimensional 
space R2n endowed with coordinates p and q. The first step of any qualitative 
study is to forget the explicit form of the object you are interested in. With 
this ideology at hand let us leave aside the expression for the function F above 
and focus on properties of general Hamiltonian systems associated with more 
or less arbitrary smooth energy functions F(p, q, t). "More or less" means that 
we impose certain assumptions on the behaviour of F at infinity in order to

Chapter 1. Introducing the Group 
guarantee that the solutions of the Hamiltonian system exist for all t E R 
So choose such an F and consider the flow it : ]R2n -+ ]R2n which takes any 
initial condition (p(O),q(O)) to the corresponding solution (p(t),q(t)) at time 
t. Informally, we call diffeomorphisms it arising in this way mechanical mo-
tions. The essence of our trick is in the fact that these diffeomorphisms of the 
2n-dimensional space ]R2n have the following remarkable geometric properties 
which cannot be seen in the original configuration space ]Rn. 
Theorem 1.1.A. (Liouville Theorem) Mechanical motions preserve the volume 
form Vol = dP1 1\ dq1 1\ ... 1\ dPn 1\ dqn. 
Theorem Ll.B. (A more delicate variant of 1.1.A) Mechanical motions pre-
serve the 2-form w = dP1 1\ dq1 + ... + dPn 1\ dqn. 
Note that Vol = ~7 and hence l.l.B implies l.l.A. Further, for n = 1, 
Theorems l.l.A and l.l.B are equivalent. Theorem l.l.B is a simple conse-
quence of the fact that mechanical motions come from Hamiltonian system. 
We leave the proof till the next section. 
Both results above go back to the past. The preservation of volume by me-
chanical motions attracted a lot of attention already more than a century ago. 
It served as the main stimulating force for creation of ergodic theory, nowadays 
a well established mathematical discipline which studies various recurrence 
properties of measure preserving transformations. However the significance of 
the role played by the invariant 2-form w has been noticed relatively recently. 
As far as I know it was V.I. Arnold who first pointed it out explicitly in the 
1960s. An attempt to understand the difference between mechanical motions 
and general volume preserving diffeomorphisms gave rise to the field of sym-
plectic topology which investigates surprising rigidity phenomena appearing in 
the theory of symplectic manifolds and their morphisms. 
Here is an example of such a phenomenon which was found by J.-C. 
Sikorav in [SI]. Let B 2(r) C ]R2 be the Euclidean disc of radius r bounded by 
the circle 8 1 (r). Consider a torus 
and a cylinder Cr = B 2(r) x ]R2n-2. 
Theorem 1.1.C. (A non-squeezing property) There is no mechanical motion 
taking LR into Cr provided R > r. 
We will prove this statement in a more general context in section 3.2.E 
below. Note that for n = 1 the result is obvious. Indeed, the area bounded 
by 8 1(R) is greater than the area of B 2(r). Thus one cannot take 8 1(R) into 
B2 (r) by an area preserving transformation. However, if n ::::: 2 then L R is a

3 
sub manifold of co dimension n ?: 2, while Cr has infinite volume. So there is 
no visible reason why the statement should hold true. Moreover, it is certainly 
wrong in the volume-preserving category! 
Exercise. Find a linear volume preserving transformation ]R2n ~ ]R2n taking 
LR into Cr for arbitrary positive rand R. 
In what follows we shall consider the evolution of a mechanical system 
as a curve in the group of all mechanical motions and study this curve by 
geometric tools. To make things work we are forced to restrict the class of 
mechanical systems we deal with. For instance, unbounded Hamiltonians such 
2 
as F(p, q, t) = P2 + U(q, t) above are too complicated to be included into such 
a framework. In fact we will always assume that Hamiltonian functions (and 
therefore the corresponding mechanical motions) are compactly supported. In 
other words all the action takes place in a bounded part of the space we live in. 
In this chapter we introduce Hamiltonian mechanics on symplectic mani-
folds which is a natural generalization of the model described above. In this 
context a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is just a mechanical motion generated 
by a compactly supported Hamiltonian function. 
1.2 
Flows and paths of diffeomorphisms 
To start with, we explain the relation between flows and differential equations, 
and give a geometric interpretation of flows as paths of diffeomorphisms. In 
view of future applications, we will assume that all objects we consider are com-
pactly supported. However, basic concepts described below can be extended 
in a straightforward way to more general situations. 
Consider a smooth manifold M without boundary. For a diffeomorphism 
¢ : M ~ M define its support supp( ¢) as the closure of all x E M such that 
¢x i- x. Denote by DiW(M) the group of all diffeomorphisms with compact 
support. Let I C ]R be an interval. 1 A path of diffeomorphisms is a map 
with the following properties: 
• the map M x I ~ M taking (x, t) to ftx is smooth; 
• there exists a compact subset K of M which contains supp ft for all tEl. 
We often denote such a path by {It}. Note that on closed manifolds the second 
condition is automatically satisfied. 
1 We define an interval as a connected subset of IE. with non-empty interior. 

4 
Chapter 1. Introducing the Group 
Every path of diffeomorphisms generates a family of vector fields ~t, t E I 
on M as follows: 
(1.2.A) 
Note that this family is smooth and compactly supported: ~t(x) = 0 for all 
x E M\K. Such a family is called a compactly supported time-dependent vector 
field on M. The correspondence above is not injective. Indeed, every path of 
the form {ftg} where g is an arbitrary element of Diffc (M) generates the same 
time-dependent vector field ~. However, for every point s E I there exists a 
unique path {ft} which generates ~ such that fs equals the identity map :no 
This path is defined as the unique solution of 1.2.A which is considered now 
as an ordinary differential equation with the initial condition fs = :no Assume 
that 0 E I and take s = O. The path {ft} constructed above with fo = :n is 
called a flow of the time-dependent vector field ~. So flows are just paths {ft} 
satisfying fo = :no 
1.3 
The mathematical model of classical mechanics 
The role of the phase space in classical mechanics is played by a symplectic 
manifold (M2n , 0). Here M is a connected manifold without boundary of even 
dimension 2n, and 0 is a closed differential 2-form on M. The form 0 is 
assumed to be non-degenerate. This means that its top power on does not 
vanish at any point. The form Vol = -\on is called the canonical volume form 
n. 
on (M, 0). It is useful to keep in mind two elementary examples of symplectic 
manifolds: an orient able surface endowed with an area form, and the linear 
space lR2n (pI, ... ,Pn, ql, ... , qn) with the form w = "Ej=l dpj /\ dqj. The second 
example is of great importance in view of the classical Darboux theorem [MSj. 
It states that locally every symplectic manifold looks like (lR 2n , w). In other 
words, near each point of M one can choose local coordinates (p, q) such that 
in these coordinates 0 is written as "Ej=l dpj /\ dqj. We call (p, q) canonical 
local coordinates. 
Let F be a smooth function on M. A vector field ~ on M is called the 
Hamiltonian vector field of F if it satisfies the pointwise linear algebraic equa-
tion i~O = -dF. An elementary argument from linear algebra (based on the 
non-degeneracy of 0) shows that ~ always exists and is unique [MSj. Sometimes 
~ is denoted by sgrad F (skew gradient of F). 
Exercise 1.3.A. Show that in canonical local coordinates (p, q) on M one has 
sgradF = (_8F 8F). 
8q , 8p 

1.3. Classical mechanics 
5 
Exercise 1.3.B. Let ¢ : M ~ M be a symplectic diffeomorphism (that is 
¢*O = 0). Show that 
sgrad(F 0 ¢-l) = ¢* sgrad F 
for every function F on M. This property, of course, reflects the fact that the 
operation sgrad is defined in the coordinate-free manner. 
In classical mechanics energy determines the evolution. The energy is a 
family of functions Ft on M which depends on the additional time variable t. 
The time t is defined on some interval I. Equivalently, one can consider the 
energy as a single function F on M x I. We shall use both points of view 
throughout the book, and keep the notation Ft(x) = F(x, t). Traditionally, F 
is called a (time-dependent) Hamiltonian function. 
The evolution of the system is described by the Hamiltonian equation 
x = sgrad Ft (x). In local canonical coordinates (p, q) on M the Hamiltonian 
equation has the familiar form (cf. 1.3.A) 
p= -~~(p,q,t) 
{ q = %(p,q,t). 
Let us introduce a linear function space A = A(M) which plays an im-
portant role below. When M is closed, define A(M) as the space of all smooth 
functions on M with zero mean with respect to the canonical volume form. 
When M is open, A(M) consists of all smooth functions with compact support. 
Definition. Let I C lR be an interval. A (time-dependent) Hamiltonian function 
F on M x I is called normalized if Ft belongs to A for all t. In the case when 
M is open we require in addition that there exists a compact subset of M 
which contains the supports of all the functions Ft , tEl simultaneously. 
In what follows we consider normalized Hamiltonians only. Let me give 
some arguments in favor of this decision. 
First of all, on open manifolds one must impose some assumptions on the 
behaviour of Hamiltonian functions at infinity. Indeed, otherwise the solutions 
of the Hamiltonian equation may blow up at finite time and thus the Hamil-
tonian flow may be ill defined. An important feature of the definition above 
is that the time dependent Hamiltonian vector field sgrad Ft of a normalized 
Hamiltonian function F is compactly supported. Thus when I contains 0 such 
a field generates a compactly supported flow which fits into the setting of the 
previous section. 
Second, both on open and closed manifolds, the mapping which takes a 
function from A to its Hamiltonian vector field is injective. Indeed, a Hamilto-
nian vector field determines the corresponding Hamiltonian function uniquely

up to an additive constant. Clearly, our normalization forbids to add con-
stants! This property of normalized Hamiltonian functions will be useful for 
our further considerations. 
1.4 The group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
Let F : M x I ----; lR be a normalized time dependent Hamiltonian function. As-
sume that I contains zero. Consider the flow {ft} of the time-dependent vector 
field sgradFt . We will say that {it} is the Hamiltonian flow generated by F. 
Every individual diffeomorphism fa, a E I of this flow is called a Hamiltonian 
diffeomorphism. Of course, the definition implies that Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms are compactly supported. 
Exercise 1.4.A (reparametrization of flows) Let {ft}, t E [0; a] be a Hamilto-
nian flow generated by a normalized Hamiltonian F(x, t). Show that {fad, t E 
[0; 1] is again a Hamiltonian flow generated by aF(x, at). Therefore every 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is in fact a time-one map of some Hamiltonian 
flow. More generally, show that for every smooth function b(t) with b(O) = 0 
the flow {fb(t)} is a Hamiltonian flow whose normalized Hamiltonian equals 
~~(t)F(x,b(t)). 
The crucial property of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is that they pre-
serve the symplectic form o. Indeed let ~ be the Hamiltonian vector field of a 
function F on M. All we have to show is that the Lie derivative £€O vanishes. 
This can be seen from the following calculation: 
£€O = i€dO + d(i€O) = -ddF = O. 
Denote by Ham(M, 0) the set of all Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. 
A path of diffeomorphisms with values in Ham(M, O) is called a Hamil-
tonian path. It sounds natural to call a flow with values in Ham(M,O) a 
Hamiltonian flow. However, after a little thinking, we realize that we are in 
trouble. Indeed, Hamiltonian flows were already defined above in a different 
way. A priori it is not at all clear why the vector field corresponding to a flow of 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is a Hamiltonian vector field! Fortunately, this 
is true. This extremely important fact was established by Banyaga in [B1]. Let 
us formulate it precisely. 
Proposition 1.4.B. For every Hamiltonian path {fd, tEl there exists a 
(time-dependent) normalized Hamiltonian function F : M x I ----; lR such that 
d 
d/tX = sgradFtUtx ) 
for all x E M and tEl. 

1.4. The group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
7 
The function F is called the normalized Hamiltonian function of {fd. 
Let us discuss this result. First assume that the manifold M satisfies the 
following topological condition: its first de Rham cohomology with compact 
supports vanishes, that is H~omp(M,JR.) = O. To have an example in mind, 
think of the 2-sphere or the linear space. In this case the proposition above 
can be proved very easily. Denote by ~t the vector field generated by It. Since 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms preserve the symplectic form 0 we have Let 0 = 
O. Hence diet 0 = 0 so iet 0 is a closed form. In view of our topological condition 
the form ietO is exact. Therefore there exists unique smooth family offunctions 
Ft(x) E A such that -dFt = ietO. It follows that F(x, t) is the normalized 
Hamiltonian of {fd. This completes the proof. However when H~omp(M, JR.) i-
0, we do not know a priori that closed forms iet 0 are exact. In this case one 
should use in addition that each individual ft is Hamiltonian. This requires 
some new ideas, see [B1l, [MSj. 
Remark 1.4.C. Let Symp(M, 0) be the group of all compactly supported diffeo-
morphisms f of M which preserve 0, that is j*O = O. Such diffeomorphisms 
are called symplectomorphisms. Denote by SymPo(M, 0) the path connected 
component of the identity in Symp(M,O). By definition, it contains those 
symplectomorphisms f which can be joined with the identity by a path of 
symplectomorphisms. Arguing exactly as in the proof of l.4.B above we see 
that such a path is Hamiltonian provided H~omp(M, JR.) = O. Therefore in this 
case 
Sympo(M,O) = Ham(M,O). 
When H~omp (M, JR.) i- 0 this equality is not valid anymore. For instance, con-
sider a 2-dimensional torus T2 = JR.2 (p, q) /22 endowed with the area form 
0= dp 1\ dq. A translation (p, q) ----t (p + a, q) obviously lies in Sympo(T2, 0). 
However, for non-integer a one can show that it is not Hamiltonian. On the 
other hand the difference between Ham and Sympo is not "too big" and it can 
be described in a rather simple way, see 14.1 below. 
The next proposition contains a remarkable elementary formula which 
will be used below on many occasions. 
Proposition 1.4.D. (Hamiltonian of the product) Consider two Hamiltonian 
paths {ft} and {9t}. Let F and G be their normalized Hamiltonian functions. 
Then the product path ht = ft9t is a Hamiltonian path generated by the 
normalized Hamiltonian function 
H(x, t) = F(x, t) + GUt-lX, t). 
Let us prove this formula. We are given that 
d

- ftx = sgrad Ft and -d 9tX = sgrad Gt.

Chapter 1. Introducing the Group 
Thus 
d 
dt (itgt)x = sgrad Ft + fh sgrad Gt. 
The second summand in the right-hand side equals sgrad( Go ft- 1) in view of 
Exercise 1.3.B above. We conclude that 
d 
1 
dt htx = sgrad( Ft + G 0 ft- ) = sgrad Ht. 
The formula is proved. 
Now we are ready to justify the title of this section. 
Proposition 1.4.E. The set of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is a group with 
respect to composition. 
Indeed, take two Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms f and g. In view of 1.4.A 
we can write f = !I and g = gl for some Hamiltonian flows {it}, {gt} defined 
for t E [0; 1]. Proposition l.4.D yields that that the path {itgt} is a Hamilto-
nian flow. Thus its time-one map fg is a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism. So the 
set Ham(M,O) is closed under composition of diffeomorphisms. It remains to 
verify that f- 1 is a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism. This follows from the next 
exercise. 
Exercise. Show that the path {ft- 1 } is a Hamiltonian flow generated by Hamil-
tonian -F(ftx, t). Hint: differentiate the identity ft 0 ft- 1 = n with respect to 
t and argue as in the proof of 1.4.D above. 
Remark 1.4.F. In differential geometry one usually deals with groups of trans-
formations which preserve certain structures on a manifold (such as the group 
Symp(M,O) of all symplectomorphisms). The group of Hamiltonian diffeo-
morphisms does not have such a friendly description (Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms are not defined as morphisms in certain natural category). This leads 
to very surprising complications. For instance the next question (known as the 
Flux conjecture, see Chapter 14) is still open for most symplectic manifolds 
M. Suppose that M is closed. Assume that some sequence of Hamiltonian 
diffeomorphisms Coo-converges to a symplectic diffeomorphism f. Is f Hamil-
tonian? 
It is extremely useful to think about Ham(M,O) in terms of Lie group 
theory. This point of view is fundamental for a development of geometric in-
tuition which is necessary for our purposes. So let us work out this language. 
We will consider Ham(M,O) as a Lie subgroup of the group of all diffeomor-
phisms of M. Thus the Lie algebra2 of Ham(M,O) is just the algebra of all 
2 As a vector space, the Lie algebra is by definition the tangent space to the group at 
the identity. The tangent spaces to the group at all other points are identified with the Lie 
algebra with the help of right shifts of the group. 

1.4. The group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms

vector fields ~ on M of the form 
~(X) = :t It=/tX, 
where Ut} is a smooth path on Ham(M,O) with fo = n. Every such field 
is Hamiltonian. Indeed, ~ = sgradFo(x), where F(x, t) is the (unique!) nor-
malized Hamiltonian function generating the path, and Fo(x) = F(x, 0). Note 
that Fo E A. Vice versa, for every function F E A the vector field sgrad F is 
by definition the derivative at t = 0 of the corresponding Hamiltonian flow. 
We conclude that the Lie algebra of Ham(M, 0) can be identified with A. 
Exercise 1.4.G. Show that with this language the tangent vector to a Hamil-
tonian path Ut} at t = s is the function Fs E A. Hint: The identification of 
tangent spaces to the group goes via right shifts (see the footnote). Thus the 
tangent vector in question is identified with the tangent vector to the path 
Uti; 1 } at t = s. 
The next important notion is the adjoint action of the Lie group on its 
Lie algebra. Recall that this operation is defined as follows. Pick an element 
f of the group Ham(M,O) and an element G from the Lie algebra A. Let 
{gt}, go = n be a path on the group which is tangent to G. In our situation the 
tangency condition means of course that the normalized Hamiltonian function 
of the flow {gt} at time t = 0 equals G. By definition, 
d I 
1 
Adf G = dt t=/gtl- . 
Differentiating, we get that the vector field on the right-hand side equals 
1* sgrad G, but this is precisely sgrad( Go 1-1) in view of Exercise 1.3.B. Re-
turning to our identification we get that 
Adf G = Go f-l. 
Thus the adjoint action of Ham(M, 0) on A is just the usual action of diffeo-
morphisms on functions. 
Finally let us discuss the Lie bracket on A. Pick two elements F, G E A, 
and let {ft}, fo = n be a Hamiltonian path tangent to F at O. The Lie bracket 
{ F, G} of F and G is called the Poisson bracket and is defined as follows: 
{F,G} = dd I 
Adft G. 
t t=o 
Calculating the expression on the right-hand side we get that 
{F,G} = -dG(sgradF) = O(sgradG,sgradF). 

10 
Chapter 1. Introducing the Group 
Let us mention that in terms of vector fields, the Lie bracket coincides with 
the usual commutator up to the sign. The reader is invited to check that 
[sgrad F, sgrad G] = - sgrad {F, G}, 
where the commutator [X, Y] of two vector fields is defined by .c[X,Y] 
.cx.cy - .cy.cx . 
Warning: Different authors may use different signs in the definitions of the 
following notions which play an important role in this book: Hamiltonian 
vector field, Poisson bracket, commutator of vector fields, and curvature of 
a connection. 
Example lo4.H. Consider the unit sphere 8 2 inside the Euclidean space ~a. 
Let n be the induced area form on the sphere. The group 80(3) acts on 8 2 by 
area preserving diffeomorphisms. Since 80(3) is path connected it is contained 
in SymPo(82). Applying l.4.C we get that SymPo(82) = Ham(82), and thus 
80(3) is a subgroup of Ham(82). In particular every element of the Lie algebra 
80(3) can be uniquely represented as a normalized Hamiltonian function on 82. 
We wish to describe this correspondence precisely. Identify 80(3) with R3 as 
follows. Every vector a E R3 is considered as a skew-symmetric transformation 
x --t [x, a] of the space, where the brackets stand for the standard vector 
product. Identify the tangent plane to 8 2 at a point x with the orthogonal 
complement to x in the space. By tautological reasons, the Hamiltonian vector 
field v of the flow x --t exp(ta)x on the sphere is given by v(x) = [x, a]. We 
claim that the corresponding normalized Hamiltonian is the height function 
F(x) = (a, x). First of all, the reflection over the orthogonal complement to a 
takes F to -F, thus F has zero mean. Further, note that n(~,'1]) = ('1], [x,~]) 
for ~,'1] E Tx8 2. Denote by a' the orthogonal projection of a to Tx82. Thus 
n(~,v(x» = ([x, a'], [x,W for every ~ E Tx82. Since the vector product with 
x is an orthogonal transformation of Tx82, the last expression equals (a',~). 
But this is precisely dF(~). The claim follows.

Algebraic properties of Ham(M, 0) 
Algebraic properties of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms were studied 
by A. Banyaga in [Bl], [B2]. In particular, he proved the following striking 
result. Recall, that a group D is called simple if every normal subgroup is 
trivial, that is equals either fi} or D itself. 
Theorem lo5.A. Let (M,O) be a closed symplectic manifold. Then the group 
Ham(M,O) is simple. 
There exists a version of this statement for open M as well. 

1.5. Algebraic properties of Ham(M, 0) 
11 
Note that an abelian group is simple if and only if every element generates 
the whole group (and so it must be a finite cyclic group whose order is a 
prime number). Thus intuitively speaking general simple groups are far from 
being abelian. Below we present an elementary statement which clarifies this 
principle for the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. We will use it in the 
next chapter. 
Proposition 1.5.B. Let (M,O) be a symplectic manifold and let U c M be 
a non-empty open subset. There exist f, 9 E Ham(M,O) such that supp(f), 
supp(g) c U and fg i= gf. 
The proof is based on the following fact. 
Proposition 1.5.C. Let {It} and {gt} be the Hamiltonian flows generated by 
time independent normalized Hamiltonian functions F and G respectively. If 
ftgt = gdt for all t then {F, G} = o. 
Proof. According to 1.4.D the corresponding Hamiltonians for ftgt and gdt 
are respectively 
F(x) + G(ft- 1(x)) 
and G(x) + F(gt 1(x)). 
But since the flows are the same for both we have that 
F(x) + G(ft- 1(x)) = G(x) + F(gt 1(x)) 
for all t. Differentiating with respect to t we get 
dG( -sgradF) = dF( -sgradG) 
which yields {F, G} = {G, F}. Hence, from the anti-commutativity of the Lie 
bracket, {F, G} = O. 
0 
Proof of 1.S.B. Choose a point x E U and tangent vectors ~,'rI E TxU such 
that O(~, 'rI) i= o. Now choose germs offunctions F and G (see exercise below) 
satisfying sgradF(x) =~, sgradG(x) = 'rI. Extend these functions by 0 outside 
U. If M is open we are done. If M is closed, add a constant to guarantee that 
F and G have zero mean. So now the functions F, G belong to A. Further, they 
are constant outside U, and so the corresponding Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
ft and gt are supported in U. Since {F, G} i= 0 we see that for some t, the 
diffeomorphisms ft and gt do not commute. 
0 
Exercise. Use local canonical coordinates near x to show that F and G in the 
proof of the corollary do exist. 
We complete this section with the following result due to A. Banyaga 
(along the lines of [B2]). 

12 
Chapter 1. Introducing the Group 
Theorem 1.5.D. Let (MI' fh) and (M2' O2 ) be two closed symplectic manifolds 
such that their groups of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms are isomorphic. Then 
the manifolds are conform ally symplectomorphic: there exists a diffeomorphism 
f : MI --t M2 and a number c i- 0 such that 1*02 = COl. 
In other words, the algebraic structure of the group of Hamiltonian difIeomor-
phisms determines the symplectic manifold up to a factor. 

Chapter 2 
Introducing the Geometry 
In the present chapter we discuss biinvariant Finsler metrics on the group of 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and define Hofer's geometry. 
2.1 
A variational problem 
What is the minimal amount of energy needed in order to generate a given 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphism cp? This natural question can be formalized as 
follows. Consider all possible Hamiltonian flows {ftl, t E [0; 1] such that 
fo = :n and It = cp. For each flow take its unique normalized Hamiltonian 
function Ft (x) and "measure its magnitude". Then minimize the result of the 
measurement over all such flows. It remains to explain what we mean by the 
"magnitude". Recall that for every t the function Ft is an element of the Lie 
algebra A. Choose any norm IIII on A in coordinate-free way, that is we require 
that 
IIH 0 ~-lll = IIHII for all HE A, ~ E Ham(M, 0). 
(2.l.A) 
Now define the magnitude as folllFtlldt. Bringing together all ingredients of 
this procedure we end up with the variational problem 
(2.l.B) 
where cp is given, and the infimum is taken over all flows {ft} as above. 

14 
Chapter 2. Introducing the Geometry 
2.2 
Biinvariant geometries on Ham(M, 0) 
It turns out that the variational problem above can be reformulated in purely 
geometrical terms. To make this transparent I wish to recall the notion of a 
Finsler structure on a manifold. We say that a manifold Z is endowed with 
a Finsler structure if its tangent spaces TzZ are equipped with a norm which 
depends smoothly on the points z E Z. Of course, Riemannian structures form 
a particular case of this notion. In general however the norms above may not 
come from a scalar product. Given a Finsler structure, one defines the length 
of a curve exactly as in the Riemannian case by 
length{z(t)}tE[a;bJ = lb norm(i(t))dt. 
Further, one introduces the distance between two points z and z' in Z as the 
infimum of lengths of all curves joining z and z'. 
Let us return to the situation described in the previous section. Since 
all tangent spaces to the group Ham(M, n) are identified with A (see section 
1.4 above), every choice of the norm II II on A leads to a Finsler structure 
on the group. Thus one can define the length of a Hamiltonian path, and the 
distance between two Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. In particular, the length 
of a Hamiltonian path {ftl, t E [a; b] with the normalized Hamiltonian F is 
given by 
length{ft} = lb IlFtlldt. 
The distance between two Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms </J and 'l/J is defined by 
p(</J, 'l/J) = inflength{ftl, 
where the infimum is taken over all Hamiltonian paths {ft}, t E [a; b] with 
fa = </J and fb = 'l/J. Of course the length of a path does not depend on the 
parametrization, thus in the definition of the distance above one can take a = 0 
and b = 1. With this language, the solution of the variational problem 2.1.B 
above is nothing else but the distance p(:n, </J)! 
The following properties of p are easily verified and are left as an exercise: 
• p(</J,'l/J) = p('l/J,</J); 
• the triangle inequality: p(</J, 'l/J) + p('l/J, 0) ?: p(</J, 0); 
• p(</J, 'l/J) ?: O. 
Recall now Condition 2.1.A imposed on the norm II II in section 2.1 above. 
In geometric language this condition means that the norm is invariant under 

2.3. The choice of the norm: Lp vs. Loo 
15 
the adjoint action of the group on the Lie algebra (see 1.4 above). In what 
follows we deal with such norms only. 
Exercise. Show that 2.l.A yields that the function p is biinvariant:1 
p(¢, 'lj;) = p(¢(j, 'lj;(j) = p((j¢, (j'lj;) 
for all ¢, 'lj;, (j E Ham(M, 0). 
It would be more honest to call the function p a pseudo-distance. Indeed, 
as we have seen above it satisfies all the axioms of a distance function on a 
metric space except possibly the non-degeneracy, that is 
p(¢,'lj;»Ofor¢i='lj;. 
(2.2.A) 
It is rather non-trivial to check the non-degeneracy even in finite dimen-
sional geometry. The argument in this case uses local compactness of mani-
folds. In our situation the group Ham(M, 0) is infinite dimensional and has no 
compactness properties. Thus a priori there is no reason for 2.2.A to be true. 
It turns out that the non-degeneracy of p is very sensitive to the choice of the 
norm 1111. 
2.3 
The choice of the norm: Lp vs. Loo 
Among the norms on A satisfying the invariancy assumption 2.l.A there is a 
very natural class which includes Lp norms, p = 1,2,3, ... 
and the Loo-norm 
IIHlloo = maxH - minH. 
Denote by Pp and Poo the corresponding pseudo-distances. 
Theorem 2.3.A. The pseudo-distance Pp is degenerate for all nnite p = 1,2, .... 
Moreover, if the manifold is closed then all such Pp vanish identically. 
This result was established in [EP]. The proof is presented below in this chapter 
(see also books [HZ], [MS], [AK]). The next theorem shows a striking contrast 
between the Lp and the Loo cases. 
lWithout assumption 2.1.A we get only right-invariant p's, that is p(¢,1/J) = p(¢(),1/J()). 
Such metrics play an important role in hydrodynamics, see [AK]. 

16 
Chapter 2. Introducing the Geometry 
Theorem 2.3.B. The pseudo-distance Poe is non-degenerate. 
This theorem2 was discovered and proved by Hofer in [HI] for the case M = 
]R2n with the use of infinite dimensional variational methods. In [VI] Viterbo 
derived it for the case M = ]R2n from his theory of generating functions. 
Both Hofer and Viterbo obtained their results as an answer to a stimulating 
question posed by Eliashberg in a private discussion. In [PI] the statement 
was extended to a wide class of symplectic manifolds with "nice" behaviour 
at infinity, and in particular to all closed symplectic manifolds such that the 
cohomology class of the symplectic form is rational. The approach of [PI] 
is based on Gromov's theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves. Finally [LMI] 
Lalonde and McDuff proved 2.3.B in full generality using Gromov's theory. 
At present some other proofs of various particular cases of this theorem are 
available, see for instance [Ch],[03],[Sch3]. Hofer's original proof is presented 
in great details in the book [HZ]. The argument due to Lalonde and McDuff 
is outlined in the book [MS] and in the survey [1]. Below we give a different 
proof for the case of M = ]R2n which follows [PI]. All known proofs are based 
on "hard" methods.3 
2.4 The concept of displacement energy 
Which invariant norms 1111 on A (that is norms satisfying 2.l.A) lead to non-
degenerate distance functions p? Below we describe a very useful reformulation 
of this question which will eventually enable us to prove Theorem 2.3.A. It is 
based on the beautiful concept of displacement energy which was introduced 
by Hofer in [HI]. Let p be a biinvariant pseudo-distance on Ham(M, 0), and 
let A be a bounded subset of M. 
Definition. The displacement energy of A is given by 
e(A) = inf{p(ll, J)I f E Ham(M, 0), f(A) n A = 0}. 
The set of such f may be empty. In what follows we use the convention that 
the infimum of the empty set equals +00. If e(A) i- 0 we will say that A has 
positive displacement energy. 
Let us mention two obvious but important properties of e(A). First of 
all, e is a monotone function of subsets: if A c B then e(A) :S e(B). Second, e 
2The historical digression below reflects my own understanding of the situation. I admit 
that other participants of this development may see it differently. 
3Moreover, to my taste all the proofs are far from being transparent. The argument 
presented in Chapter 3 below is not an exception. I strongly believe that in the future one 
will find the explanation of this fundamental result. 

2.4. The concept of displacement energy 
17 
is an invariant, that is e(A) = e(f(A)) for every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism 
f of M. We leave the proofs to the reader. 
Example. Consider (]R2, w) and take an open square A whose edges have length 
u and are parallel to the coordinate axes. Let us estimate the displacement 
energy of A with respect to the distance Poo. Consider the Hamiltonian function 
H(p, q) = up. The corresponding Hamiltonian system is 
{ q=u 
p=o 
Therefore its time-I-map h sends (p, q) to (p, q+u). Note that all the motion of 
the square takes place in the rectangle K = Closure ( AU h( A)). Consider a cut 
off F of the Hamiltonian H outside a small neighbourhood of K.4 Note that 
F (in contrast to H) is a normalized Hamiltonian function. Since F = H on 
K, the time one map f of the Hamiltonian flow generated by F still displaces 
the square A. We can always perform the cutting off in such a way that the 
Loo-norm of F is arbitrary close to the oscillation of H on K. This oscillation 
equals 
maxH - minH = u2 - 0 = u2 . 
K 
K 
Thus we get that 
e(A) ::; u2 = Area(A). 
Note that the square is symplectomorphic to the disc of the same area in 
]R2 (this is not true in higher dimensions!). Thus we proved that e(B2(r)) ::; 
7rr2. A deep result due to Hofer ([HI]) states that actually there is equality in 
all dimensions, in other words e( B2n (r)) = 7rr2. See [LMI] for a generalization 
to arbitrary symplectic manifolds. We will prove a lower bound for e(B2n(r)) 
in the next chapter. 
In general, if the displacement energy of all non-empty open subsets 
with respect to some biinvariant pseudo-metric p is positive then p is non-
degenerate. Indeed, each f E Ham(M, 0) such that f i- -n must displace some 
small ball A c M. Thus we get that p(-n, f) 2: e(A) > O. In fact, the converse 
is also true. 
Theorem 2.4.A. ([EPj) If p is non-degenerate then e(A) > 0 for every non-
empty open subset A. 
In order to prove this theorem we need an auxiliary lemma. 
4Let Y be a closed subset of a manifold Z, and let H be a smooth function defined in a 
neighbourhood V of Y. By a cut off F of H outside a small neigbourhood of Y we mean the 
following. Choose a neighbourhood W of Y whose closure is contained in V. Take a smooth 
function a : Z ---+ [0; 1] which equals 1 on Wand vanishes outside V. Define now F by aH 
on V and by 0 outside V. 

18 
Chapter 2. Introducing the Geometry 
Lemma 2.4.B. Let A c M be a non-empty open subset. For all ¢, 'ljJ E 
Ham(M, O) with supp(¢) c A and supp('ljJ) C A, we have e(A) 2: ~p(l1, [¢, 'ljJ]). 
Here [¢, 'ljJ] stands for the commutator 'ljJ-I¢-I'ljJ¢. The theorem imme-
diately follows from the lemma in view of Proposition 1.5.B of the previous 
chapter. 
Proof of 2.4.A. By 1.5.B there exist ¢, 'ljJ supported in A with [¢, 'ljJ] i- ll. Since 
p is non-degenerate this implies that e(A) 2: ~p(ll, [¢, 'ljJ]) > O. 
D 
Proof of 2.4.B. Assume that there exists h E Ham(M,O) such that h(A) n 
A = 0 (if such an h does not exist we are done because e (A) = +00). Set 
e = ¢h-I¢-Ih = [h,¢-I]. If x E A then h(x) ~ A. Since ¢ = II outside 
A we get ¢-Ih(x) = h(x). So we see that h-I¢-Ih(x) = x and therefore 
elA = ¢IA. Now supp('ljJ) c A and therefore ¢-I'ljJ¢ = e-I'ljJe which implies 
that [¢, 'ljJ] = [e, 'ljJ]. Note that 
p(ll, [e, 'ljJ]) = p(ll, 'ljJ-Ie-I'ljJe) 
= p(e- I , 'ljJ-Ie-I'ljJ) 
:S p(ll, e-I) + p(ll, 'ljJ-Ie-I'ljJ) 
= 2p(ll, e). 
Here we have used the bi-invariance of p and the triangle inequality. Analo-
gously, 
p(ll,e) = p(ll, [h,¢-I]) ~ 2p(1l,h). 
Putting these two inequalities together we get 
p(ll, [¢, 'ljJ]) = p(ll, [e, 'ljJ]) :S 2p(ll, e) :S 4p(1l, h). 
Since this holds for all hE Ham(M, 0) with h(A) nA = 0 we obtain, by taking 
the infimum, that 4e(A) 2: p(ll, [¢, 'ljJ]). 
D 
Recall that Theorem 2.3.A states that for p < 00 the Lp-norm leads to a 
degenerate pseudo-distance, which in fact vanishes on closed manifolds. Now 
we will prove this statement and see why the argument breaks down in the 
Loo-case. 
Proof of 2.3.A. We will show that the displacement energy of a "small" ball 
vanishes. Then the degeneracy of Pp follows from 2.4.A. Let U be an open 
subset of M endowed with canonical coordinates (x, y). In these coordinates 
the symplectic form 0 is given by 2: dXil\dYi. Assume without loss of generality 
that U contains a ball 2:(x; + yJ) < 10. Let A cUbe the ball with the 
same center of the radius 0.1. Consider a (partially defined) flow ht, t E [0; 1] 
on U which is simply a shift by t along the YI coordinate. Such a shift is 

2.4. The concept of displacement energy 
19 
generated by a (non-normalized!) Hamiltonian function H(x, y) = Xl on U. 
Clearly, h1(A)nA = 0. Denote by St the sphere ht(8A). Consider a new (time-
dependent) normalized Hamiltonian function Gt = Ft+ct where Ft is obtained 
from H by a cut off outside a small neighbourhood of St, and Ct is a (time 
dependent) constant. Here of course Ct = 0 if the manifold M is open, and Ct = 
- Vol(M)-l fM Ft Vol if M is closed. Since for every t the function Gt coincides 
with H near St up to an additive constant we conclude that sgrad Gt = sgrad H 
near St. Hence the Hamiltonian flow {gd of G satisfies gt(8A) = ht(8A) and 
so gl(8A) n 8A = 0. But this obviously implies that gl(A) n A = 0. Note 
now that using cutting off outside very small neighbourhoods of St we can 
achieve that the Lp-norm of every function Gt is arbitrary small (in contrast 
to the Loo-norm!). Therefore the Lp- displacement energy of A vanishes. This 
completes the proof of the degeneracy of pp. 
Let us turn now to the second statement of the theorem, where we assume 
that the manifold M is closed. Set 
9 = {g E Ham(M, D) I p(ll, g) = a}. 
Take j, 9 E g. Then of course g-l E g. Further the triangle inequality yields 
that 
p(ll, jg) = p(j-1, g) ::; p(ll, f) + p(ll, g) = 0 
so 9 is a subgroup of Ham(M, D). By the bi-invariance we know that if j E 
9 and h E Ham(M, D) then hjh- 1 E g, and so 9 is a normal subgroup. 
In view of Banyaga's theorem 1.5.A above the group Ham(M, D) is simple. 
Therefore either 9 = {1l} or 9 = Ham(M, D). We already proved that Pp is 
degenerate, hence 9 i- {1l}. Thus 9 coincides with the whole group Ham(M, D). 
We conclude that Pp vanishes identically.

Exercise. Prove that the displacement energy of s2n-2 C ffi.2n-l C ffi.2n with 
respect to p= vanishes. On the other hand, we will see in the next chapter 
that there exist half-dimensional submanifolds of ffi.2n which have positive dis-
placement energy (cf. 1.1.C above). 
Open problem. Which invariant norms on A give rise to non-degenerate dis-
tance functions p? Is it true that such norms are always bounded below by 
constll 1100? A difficulty here is that no classification of Ham(M, D)-invariant 
norms is known. A potential approach to this problem would be to investigate 
cut-offs. If cutting off decreases the norm arbitrarily then our argument above 
shows that p is degenerate. 
Open problem. [EP] It is quite natural to consider separately the positive and 
the negative parts of the metric Poo. More explicitly, set 
p+(ll, f) = inf 11 max Ftdt,

Then clearly 
p(:n, J) 2 p+(:n, J) + p_(:n, J). 
However in all examples known to me equality holds! It would be interesting 
to prove a general statement, or to find a counterexample. Note that it follows 
from [VI] that on Ham(ffi2n) the sum p+ + p_ defines a biinvariant metric. As 
far as I know, no analogue of this statement was proved for general symplectic 
manifolds. 
Convention. Unless otherwise stated in what follows we use notation II II for 
the Loo-norm on A(M). We write p for the metric Poo and call it Hofer's 
metric. The quantity p(:n, J) is called Hofer's norm of f. We write length{ft} 
for the length of a Hamiltonian path Ud with respect to the Loo-norm (see 
2.2 above). 

Chapter 3 
Lagrangian Submanifolds 
The purpose of the next two chapters is to prove that Hofer's metric on ~2n 
is non-degenerate. We use an approach of [PI]. For that purpose we introduce 
Lagrangian sub manifolds of symplectic manifolds. Lagrangian sub manifolds 
play a fundamental role in symplectic topology as well as in its applications 
to mechanics and calculus of variations. They will appear on many occasions 
throughout this book. 
3.1 
Definitions and examples 
Definition. Let (M 2n, D) be a symplectic manifold and let L c M be a 
submanifold. We call L Lagrangian if dim L = ~dim M = nand DITL == o. 
An embedding (or immersion) f : Ln ----+ M 2n is called Lagrangian if rD == O. 
Let us list some important examples of Lagrangian submanifolds. 
3.1.A. Curves on surfaces 
Let (M2, D) be an oriented surface with an area form. Then every curve is La-
grangian (since the tangent space to a curve is one dimensional and D vanishes 
when it is evaluated on two vectors which are proportional). 
3.1.B. The split torus (cf. 1.1.C above). 
The torus 8 1 x ... X 8 1 C ~2 X ..• X ~2 = ~2n is Lagrangian (the 2-form D 
on ~2n splits). 
3.1. C. Graphs of closed l-forms in cotangent bundles 
This example plays an important role in classical mechanics. Let Nn be any 
manifold. Consider the cotangent bundle M = T* N of N with the natural 
projection 7r : T* N ----+ N, (p, q) 
f----7 q. Define the following I-form ,\ on M 
which is called the Liouville form. For q E N, (p, q) E T* N and ~ E T(p,q)T* N 

22 
Chapter 3. Lagrangian Submanifolds 
we set .A(~) = (p, 7r*~) where ( , ) is the natural pairing between T* N and TN. 
We claim that 0 = d.A is a symplectic form on T* M. We use local coordinates 
(PI, ... ,Pn, qI, ... , qn) on T* N and write ~ = (PI,··· ,Pn, (iI, ... , rin), so 7r*~ = 
(ri1, ... , rin). With this notation the pairing reads (p, 7r*~) = ~Pirii which 
implies that .A(~) = ~Pidqi. Therefore 0 = d.A = ~ dPil\dqi' and we recognize 
the standard symplectic form on R2n. The claim follows. 
Exercise. Let a be a 1-form on N. Show that graph(a) is a Lagrangian 
submanifold of T* N if and only if a is closed. 
3.1.D. Symplectomorphisms as Lagrangian submanifolds 
Let f : (M,O) -----t (M,O) be a diffeomorphism. Consider a new symplectic 
manifold (M x M, 0$-0). We leave it as an exercise to show that graph (I) c 
(M x M,O $ -0) is Lagrangian if and only if f is a symplectomorphism. 
3.1.E. Lagrangian suspension 
Let L c (M,O) be a Lagrangian submanifold. Consider a loop of Hamilto-
nian diffeomorphisms {ht}, t E 8\ ho = hI = :n generated by a 1-periodic 
Hamiltonian function H(x, t). 
Proposition. Let M x T* 8 1 be a symplectic manifold with symplectic form 
(J = 0 + dr 1\ dt where M is as above and (r, t) are the coordinates on T* 8 1 = 
R X 8 1. Then 
¢ : L X 8 1 -----t M x T* 8 1, (x, t) I---t (ht(x), -H(ht(x), t), t) 
is a Lagrangian embedding. 
Proof. It suffices to prove that ¢* (J vanishes on pairs (~, e) and on pairs (~, %t) 
for ~,e E T Land %t E T 8 1 . One computes that 
so ¢*(J(~, e) = O(hh~' hhe) = O(~, e) = 0 since L is Lagrangian. Further-

3.2 
The Liouville class of Lagrangian 
submanifolds in }R2n 
23 
o 
Let L C (jR2n, dp 1\ dq) be a Lagrangian submanifold. Consider the restriction 
>'ITL of the Liouville form 
>. = P1dql + ... + Pndqn 
to L. Clearly d(>.ITL) = nlTL = O. The cohomology class >'L E Hl(L, jR) of 
this closed I-form is called the Liouville class of the Lagrangian submanifold 
L. Similary, for a Lagrangian embedding or immersion <I> : L ---t jR2n we define 
the Liouville class as [<1>* >.J. Geometrically, the Liouville class of a Lagrangian 
submanifold can be interpreted as follows. Let a E H1(L) be a I-cycle. Then 
we can find a 2-chain ~ in jR2n with {)~ = a. Now 
and it is easy to see that this is independent of the choice of ~. In view of this 
formula the value (>'L, a) is sometimes called the symplectic area of a. The last 
construction generalizes to an arbitrary Lagrangian manifold L of a symplec-
tic manifold M and defines a natural homomorphism H2(M, L; 7L.) ---toR An 
important property of >'L is that it is invariant under symplectomorphisms of 
jR2n i.e. f* >'/(L) = >'L. 
Theorem 3.2.A. ({Gl}) Assume that L C jR2n is a closed Lagrangian submani-
fold. Then >'L =f o. 
Let us emphasize that here L is embedded. For Lagrangian immersions 
this statement is in general not true. In the case n = 1 this can be seen as 
follows. It is clear that any closed embedded curve bounds a subset of positive 
area, but for example the immersed figure eight curve can bound a set with 
zero area. This phenomenon reflects "rigidity of Lagrangian embeddings" . 
Definition. A closed Lagrangian submanifold L C (jR2n, w) is called rational if 
>'L(Hl(L;7L.)) c jR is a discrete subgroup. 

24 
Chapter 3. Lagrangian Submanifolds 
We will denote its positive generator by "(( L). 
Example. The split torus L = SI (r) x ... X SI (r) C 1~2n is rational. Since 
each SI(r) has symplectic area 7rr2 we have "((L) = 7rr2. However, the torus 
SI (I) X SI (ij2) C ]R4 is not rational. The symplectic areas of the two circles 
are respectively 7r and ij47r and they generate a dense subgroup of R 
Theorem 3.2.B. (fSl]) Let L C B2(r) x ]R2n-2 be a closed rational Lagrangian 
submanifold. Then "((L) ~ 7rr2. 
Note that the assumption that L is embedded is necessary. Figure I shows 
an immersed Lagrangian submanifold of arbitrary symplectic area. 
Figure I 
Our next result gives a lower bound for the displacement energy e(L) of 
a rational Lagrangian submanifold L with respect to Hofer's metric. 
Theorem 3.2.C. Let L C ]R2n be a closed rational Lagrangian submanifold. 
Then e(L) 2: !,,((L). 
Theorems 3.2.A and 3.2.B are proved in the next chapter. Theorem 3.2.C 
follows from 3.2.B (see section 3.3 below). Let us derive some consequences of 
these results. 
3.2.D. Non-degeneracy of Hofer's metric. Theorem 3.2.C implies that Hofer's 
metric on Ham(]R2n,w) is non-degenerate. Indeed, each ball B2n(r) = {pi + 
... + p~ + qr + ... + q~ ~ r2} contains a rational split torus

Thus e(B2n(r)) 2: ;: > 0, and as it was explained in 2.4 above we get the 
desired non-degeneracy of p. This estimate is not sharp. Hofer proved [HI] 
that e(B2n(r)) = 7rr2. 
3.2.E. The non-squeezing property. Note that "((L) is a symplectic invariant 
i.e. for a symplectomorphism f : ]R2n ----+ ]R2n we have "(U(L)) = "((L). Thus 
Theorem 3.2.B implies the non-squeezing Theorem 1.1.C. Recall that it states 

3.2. The Liouville class 
25 
that a split torus with large 'Y(L) = 7fR2 cannot be moved by a Hamiltonian 
diffeomorphism into B2(r) x ]R2n-2 for r < R. 
3. 2. F. The cylindrical symplectic capacity. Let A C ]R2n be a bounded subset 
and set 
where g is a symplectomorphism. This function defined on subsets of ]R2n is 
called the cylindrical symplectic capacity. In this language Theorem 3.2.B reads 
that for a closed rational Lagrangian sub manifold c(L) 2': 'Y(L). This capacity 
is a symplectic invariant and satisfies the following monotonicity property. 
For A c B, c(A) :S c(B) (compare to a similar monotonicity property of the 
displacement energy, see 2.4 above). 
3.2. G. Some generalizations. Let (M, 0) be a symplectic manifold. When M is 
open we assume that it has a "nice" behaviour at infinity (this class includes for 
instance any cotangent bundle endowed with the standard symplectic struc-
ture, as well as a product of a cotangent bundle with any closed symplectic 
manifold). Take a Lagrangian sub manifold L c M, and consider a homomor-
phism AL : 7f2(M, L) ----t ]R which takes any disc ~ in M whose boundary lies 
on L to its symplectic area J~ O. Exactly as in the case M = ]R2n we say that 
L is rational if the image of AL is discrete, and for a rational L define 'Y(L) 
as the positive generator of the image of AL. When AL = 0 put 'Y(L) = +00. 
Our proof of Theorem 3.2.C extends without essential changes to this more 
general setting (see [PI]), namely one gets that e(L) 2': ~'Y(L). As a corollary,! 
we obtain the following important fact proved by Gromov in [GI]: e(L) = +00 
when AL = O. This can be interpreted as a Lagrangian intersection property: 
if AL = 0 then ¢(L) intersects L for every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism ¢. We 
discuss an application of this result to Hofer's geometry in Chapter 6 below. 
Let us mention also that these estimates were significantly improved in 
[Ch] with the use of Floer homology (see also [03]). In particular it was shown 
that every (not necessarily rational) closed Lagrangian sub manifold L c M 
has positive displacement energy. 
3.2.H. An isoperimetric inequality. We conclude this section with the following 
beautiful result due to Viterbo [V2]. Let L C ]R2n be a closed Lagrangian 
submanifold. Denote by V the n-dimensional Euclidean volume of L. Then 
The precise constant is still to be found. 
lThis point was missed in [PI, p. 359].

Chapter 3. Lagrangian Submanifolds 
3.3 Estimating the displacement energy 
In this section we deduce Theorem 3.2.C from Theorem 3.2.B by an elementary 
geometric argument. 
Step 1. Let L be a closed rational Lagragian submanifold and let ht, t E [0, 1] 
be a path of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms such that ho = :n and hI (L) nL = 0. 
Fix c > 0. Without loss of generality one can assume that ht = :n for t E [0, c] 
and ht = hI for t E [1 - c, 1]. Indeed, one can achieve this by a suitable 
reparametrization of the flow which preserves its length (use Exercise 1.4.A 
above). Let H(x, t) be the corresponding Hamiltonian function. Set 
1 = length {ht} = fl maxHt - min Htdt. 
io 
x 
x 
We have to prove that 1 2': ~'Y(L). The master plan is to encode the motion 
of L under the flow as a closed Lagrangian submanifold in R2n+2 and then 
obtain the result using 3.2.B. We will make use of the Lagrangian suspension 
construction described before. In order to do this we need a loop of Hamiltonian 
diffeomorphisms. 
Step 2. We create a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms for t E [0,2] 
gt = { 
ht 
h2- t 
with corresponding Hamiltonian 
for t E [0,1] 
for t E [1,2] 
{ 
H(x, t) 
G(x, t) = 
-H(x, 2 - t) 
for t E [0,1] 
for t E [1,2]. 
Exercise. Show that J~ G(gt(x), t)dt = ° 
for all x. 
Apply now the Lagrangian suspension construction (see 3.l.E above). We 
get a new Lagrangian submanifold L' C R2n X T* 8 1 as the image of L x 8 1 
under the mapping 
(x, t) I-t (gt(x), -G(gt(x), t), t). 
Note that we take here 8 1 = R/2Z. Define two functions 
a+(t) = - minG(x, t) + c and a_(t) = - maxG(x, t) - c. 
x 
x 
Clearly L' C R 2n X C C R2n X T* 8 1, where C stands for the annulus {a_ (t) < 
r < a+(t)} (see Figure 2). 

3.3. Estimating the displacement energy 
27 
Figure 2 
Step 3. We now wish to pass from ]R2n X T* 8 1 to ]R2n X ]R2. For this purpose 
we consider a special symplectic immersion () : C ----t ]R2 (this is known as 
Gromov's figure eight trick, see [Gl], [ALl ). 
Exercise. (See Figure 3) Show that there exists a symplectic immersion () : 
C ----t ]R2(p, q) with the following properties: 
• () takes the zero-section {r = O} to the figure eight curve with ears of 
equal area. Thus the closed form ()*pdq - rdt is exact (it is closed because 
() is a symplectomorphism). 
• () is an embedding outside the thin necks and glues the thin necks to-
gether. 
• the area of the interior ears is arbitrarily small, say 10 each. 
Note now that 
area (C) = r
2 (a+(t) - a_(t))dt = 2 r
1 (maxHt - min Ht)dt + 410 = 2l + 410. 
Jo

Thus the image ()( C) can be enclosed by a disc B of area 2l + 1010 (we take 
1010 to make up for the extra bits). 
Step 4. Consider now the symplectic immersion 
()' = id x () : ]R2n X C ----t ]R2n X ]R2.

Obviously O'(L') C1R2n+2 is an immersed Lagrangian submanifold and O'(L') C 
1R2n X B. We will show that L" = O'(L') is embedded. 
Observe that the only place where double points could occur is in the thin 
necks. But for tE [-E,E], gt(L) = L and for tE [l-E, I+E], gt(L) = hl(L) and by 
assumption hl (L)nL=0 so there are no double points and 0' is an embedding. 
Step 5. The only thing we are left to show is that L" is rational so that we 
can apply 3.2.B. We will prove that '"'((L) = '"'((L"). Let ¢ be the composition 
of the Lagrangian suspension and Of, that is the map 
¢ : L x SI ~ 1R2n X T* sl ~ 1R2n(Pl,'" ,Pn, ql, ... , qn) x 1R?(p, q) 
sending (x, t) to (gt(x), O( -G(gt(x), t), t)). Then L" is the image of L x SI under 
¢. The group HI (L") is generated by the cycles of the form ¢(b) where either 
beL x {O}, or b = {xo} X SI for Xo E L. In the first case ¢(b) = b x {O(O,O)}, 
so the symplectic areas of band ¢(b) coincide. In the second case write a for 
the orbit {gtXo} , t E [0; 2]. Note that

P1dql + ... + Pndqn + J 
O*pdq 
= 0 + J 
rdt = -1
2 G(gt(Xo), t)dt = O. 
This proves that L" is a rational Lagrangian submanifold with '"'((L) = '"'((L"). 
Since L" is contained in 1R2n X B we get in view of 3.2.B that 
'"'((L") ~ area (B) = 2l + 10E, 
for all E > O. Therefore e(L) ~ ~'"'((L).

Chapter 4 
The a-Equation with 
Lagrangian Boundary Conditions 
In this chapter we prove Theorem 3.2.B which states that ,,/(L) ~ rrr2 for any 
closed rational Lagrangian submanifold L C B2(r) xR2n-2. The proof is based 
on Gromov's techniques of pseudo-holomorphic discs. 
4.1 
Introducing the a-operator 
Identify R2n(Pl, ql,.·· ,Pn, qn) with 
en(pl + iqI, ... ,Pn + iqn) = en(Wl, ... , wn). 
Denote by ( , ) the Euclidean scalar product. The three geometric structures 
we get in this way are the Euclidean, the symplectic and the complex structure. 
They are related by the following formula 
(~, TJ) = w(~, iTJ)· 
We will check this formula in the case n = 1. Let ~ = (pi, q') and TJ = (p", q"). 
Then 
dp 1\ dq(~, iTJ) = dp 1\ dq( (::) , (~() ) = pip" + q' q" = (~, TJ). 
In what follows we will measure areas and lengths using the Euclidean metric. 
Consider the unit disc D2 C e with coordinate z = x + iy. For a smooth map 
f : D2 -t en we define the a-operator, a : Coo (D2 , en) -t Coo (D2 , en) by

4.2. The boundary value problem 
31 
4.2 
The boundary value problem 
Let L c Cn be a closed Lagrangian submanifold and let 9 : D2 X Cn ~ Cn be 
a smooth map which is bounded together with all its derivatives. Fix a class 
a E H2(C n ,L). Given this data consider the following problem. 
Find a smooth map J: (D2,8D2) ~ (Cn,L) such that 
{ 
8J(z) = g(z, J(z)) 
[f] = a. 
(P(a,g)) 
Example. If 9 = 0, a = 0 then the space of solutions of P(O, 0) consists of the 
constant mappings J(z) == w for wE L. To see this first observe that w(f) = O. 
Indeed, since a = 0 and L is Lagrangian the curve J(8D2) bounds a 2-chain 
in L with zero symplectic area. This chain together with J(D2 ) forms a closed 
surface in Cn . Since w is exact the symplectic area of this surface vanishes. 
Therefore w(f) = O. Further, since 9 = 0 we get that 8J = O. So the first 
part of 4.l.A yields Area (f) = 0 and hence ¥X is parallel to ~{. On the other 
hand III = -illl and therefore III 1. Ill. Consequently af = III = O. So J is 
ax

a constant map and because of the boundary condition its image lies in L. 
Assume now that we have a sequence of functions {gn} which Coo_ 
converges to some function g. Let In be the solutions of the corresponding 
problems P(a, gn). Gromov's famous compactness theorem (see [GIl, [ALl) 
states that either Un} contains a subsequence that converges to a solution of 
P(a, g) or bubbling off takes place. In order to explain what bubbling off is we 
introduce the concept of a cusp solution. 
Definition. Consider the following data: 
• A decomposition a = a' + {31 + ... + {3k, where (3j -=I- 0, j = 1, ... k. 
• A solution J of P(a',g). 
• Solutions hj of P({3j, 0), these are the so called pseudo-holomorphic discs. 
This object is called a cusp solution of P(a, g) and J(D2)Uh1 (D2)U· . ·Uhk(D2) 
is called its image. 
The bubbling off phenomenon means that there exists a subsequence of 
Un} (which we denote again by Un}) which converges to a cusp solution 
of P(a,g). The only feature of this convergence which is important for our 
purposes is the continuity of the Euclidean area: 
k 
Area (fn) ~ Area (f) + LArea (hj ). 
j=l 

32 
Chapter 4. The a-Equation 
The complete definition of the convergence is quite sophisticated (see [GIl, 
[AL]), and we omit it. An illustrating example will be given in 4.4 below. 
Using the compactness theorem, Gromov established the following im-
portant result [Gl]. 
Persistence Principle. Consider a "generic" family 9s(Z,W), 8 E [0,1] with 
90 = o. Then either P(0,9s) has a solution for all 8 or bubbling off occurs 
at some 8 00 :S 1, that is there exists a subsequence 8j ----+ 8 00 such that the 
sequence of solutions of P(0,9sj ) converges to a cusp solution of P(0,9soo ). 
The word "generic" should be interpreted as follows. One can endow the 
space of all families 9s with an appropriate Banach manifold structure. Generic 
families form a residual subset (that is a countable intersection of open and 
dense subsets) in this space. In particular, every family 9s becomes generic after 
an arbitrarily small perturbation. We refer to [G 1], [AL] for further details. 
4.3 
An application to the Liouville class 
We present here Sikorav's proof of Theorem 3.2.B [SI]. Suppose that L c 
B2 (r) X en - 1 is a closed Lagrangian submanifold. Take 9( Z, w) = ((5,0, ... , 0) E 
en for some (5 E C 
Lemma 4.3.A. If 1(51 > r then P(O, 9) has no solutions.

4.4. An example 
33 
Take now any a with 10'1 > r and apply the persistence principle to the 
family gs = (so', 0, ... ,0), s E [0,1]. The previous lemma tells us that there is 
no solution for s = 1, so we have that for a small perturbation of g8 bubbling 
off takes place. For the sake of simplicity we assume that it happens in g8 itself. 
The general argument goes through without changes (make estimates up to c) 
and is left to the reader. 
So we have a sequence Sn ----* Soo :::::; 1 and a decomposition ° 
= a + 
(31 + ... + (3k, (3j i= 0. Let fn be the solutions of P(O,gsJ, foo a solution of 
P(a, gSocJ and hI, ... hk holomorphic discs with [hj] = (3j satisfying 
k 
Area (fn) ----* Area (foo) + LArea (hj ). 
j=1 
Applying both parts of 4.1.A and using the fact that the discs hj are holomor-
phic we get that Area (hj ) = w(hj ) 2: "((L). This inequality follows from the 
fact that [hj] = (3j i= 0. From 4.1.A.ii we deduce that 
Area (foo) 2: Iw(foo) I = \ LW(hj)\2: "((L). 
Thus Area (f (0) + I: Area (hj ) 2: 2"(( L). On the other hand 4.1.A.i implies 
that 
Area (fn) :::::; 21fs;laI 2 :::::; 21flaI 2 . 
We use here that w(fn) = ° 
(since [In] = 0) and 8fn = gSn. Putting these two 
inequalities together we get 21fla1 2 2: 2"((L). This is true for all a with 10'1 > r 
so we have 1fr2 2: "((L), which proves the theorem. 
D 
Proof of 3.2.A. Consider a closed Lagrangian submanifold L C B 2(r) x en-I. 
Then 4.3.A above implies that the problem 
{ 
8f(z) = (So', 0, ... ,0), 
10'1> r 
[f] = 0. 
has no solution for S = 1. The persistence principle implies that bubbling off 
must take place. This means that there exists a non-zero class (31 which is 
represented by a holomorphic disc hI. Since hI i= constant, we get W(hl) > 0. 
Since we found a disc in en spanned by hI (&D2) which has non-zero symplectic 
area, we conclude that AL i= 0.

4.4 An example 
In this section we sketch an elementary example where all the phenomena 
appearing in the proof can be seen explicitly. Let L = &D2 C e and let a = 1.

Chapter 4. The 8-Equation 
We wish to find all maps f : D2 -t C such that f(8D2) C 8D2 and 
{ 
8f(z,z) = s 
[flaD2] = o. 
(4.4.A) 
Since ~ = s then f(z, z) = sz + u(z) where u is a holomorphic function on 
D2. We claim that the function s + zu(z) is holomorphic, takes 8D2 to 8D2 
and that (s + zu(Z))laD2 has degree 1. Indeed, 
zf(z, z) = slzl2 + zu(z) 
so 
Izllf(z, z)1 = Islzl2 + zu(z)l· 
If Izl = 1 this reduces to If(z, z)1 = Is + zu(z)1 but If(z, z)1 = 1. So s + zu(z) 
is a holomorphic function taking 8D2 to 8D2. Observe that deg f = 0 and 
deg z = 1 so the total degree, deg zf = 1 and hence deg (s + zu(z)) = 1. All 
such holomorphic functions are known as isometries of the hyperbolic metric 
in the unit disc. They have the form 
iO 1- az 
e --
z-a 
for () E Rand lal > 1. Thus s + zu(z) = eiO lz-=-a: so 
eiO + as - z(s + eiOa) 
zu(z) = 
. 
z-a 
Since u is holomorphic it cannot have any poles, so eiO + as = 0 and hence 
a = _e:o. Now 1 < lal = 
I~I implies that s < 1 and that there are no 
solutions of 4.4.A for s 2: 1. So bubbling off must occur at s = 1. For the sake 
of simplicity we put () = o. Then 
s - .! 
1 - S2 
u(z) = - z + 1 = sz + 1 
s 
so fs(z,z) = sz+ !;~~. When s goes to 1, fs(z,z) -t z for all z =1= -1 and this 
convergence is uniform outside every neighbourhood of -1. 
Consider the graphs of fs in D2 x D2 C C X C. Set w = fs(z, z) so 
(w - sz)(sz + 1) = 1- S2. 
When s -t 1 this equation goes to (w - z) (z + 1) = 0 and the graph becomes 
the union of two curves 
w = z and 
z =-1. 

4.4. An example 
35 
Here w = z is the graph of 100 and {z = -I} corresponds to the holo-
morphic disc with boundary on {-I} x L. Projecting onto the w-coordinate 
we get bubbling off. Indeed, Ioo(z) = z is a solution of P( -a, 1) where a = [Sl] 
and the holomorphic disc h(z) = z is a solution of P(a, 0). 
In order to visualize the bubbling off phenomenon we restrict to the real 
axes. Consider the graphs of the corresponding functions Is(x) = sx + !;~: 
for x E [-1,1]. We get the following picture, see Figure 4. The graphs of Is 
converge to the union of two curves, the graph of the real part of 100 and the 
segment I = [-1, 1] which is the real part of the holomorphic disc { -I} x D2.

Linearization of Hofer's Geometry 
In this chapter we interpret the function p(:n, ¢) as the distance between a 
point and a subset in a linear normed space. Later on this will enable us in 
some interesting cases to find lower bounds for p(:n, ¢ ). 
5.1 
The space of periodic Hamiltonians 
Denote by F the space of all smooth normalized Hamiltonian functions F : 
M x ~ ---t ~ which are I-periodic in time: F(x, t + 1) = F(x, t) for all x E M. 
We will often consider such F as functions on M x 8 1, where 8 1 = ~/Z. For 
a function F E F denote by ¢F the time-one-map it of the corresponding 
Hamiltonian flow {fd. 
Note that every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism ¢ can be represented in this 
way. Indeed, let {gt} be any flow with gl = cp. Take a function a: [0; 1] ---t [0; 1] 
such that a == 0 near 0 and a == 1 near 1. Consider the new flow It = ga(t) and 
extend it on the whole ~ by the formula it+! = itll. Clearly we get a smooth 
flow. The claim follows from the next exercise. 
Exercise S.1.A. Prove that a flow {It}, t E ~ is generated by a function from 
F if and only if it+! = itll for all t. 
Consider a subset 11 C F defined by 
11 = {H E F I ¢H = :n}. 
In other words Hamiltonians from 11 generate loops of Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms (or Hamiltonian loops). Introduce a norm on F as follows: 
IIIFIII = max IlFtll = max(maxF(x, t) - minF(x, t)).

Chapter 5. Linearization 
Theorem 5.1.B. For every FE F 
p(l1,cpF) = inf IIIF-HIII. 
HE'H 
Figure 5 
Note that the right-hand side is simply the distance from F to H in the 
sense of our norm (see Figure 5). Thus the set H carries a lot of information 
about Hofer's geometry. In the next chapters we will establish some interesting 
properties of H and will look closely at Hamiltonian loops. 
Theorem 5.l.B is a simple consequence of the following fact. 
Lemma 5.1.e. For every cP E Ham(M) 
p(l1,cp) = inflllFlll, 
where the infimum is taken over all Hamiltonians from F which generate cp. 
In the terminology of some of my papers this means that the "coarse" 
Hofer's norm coincides with the usual one. 
Proof of 5.1.C. For cP E Ham(M,O) set r(:ll,cp) = inflllFlll where F runs over 
all Hamiltonians F E F which generate cp. Clearly r(:ll,cp) 2: p(:ll,cp). Our task 
is to prove the converse inequality. Fix a positive number E. Choose a path 
{ft}, t E [0; 1] of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms such that fa = :ll,!I = cp and 
such that Jo1 m( t )dt ~ p(:ll, cp) + E where m( t) = II Ft II. We can assume without 
loss of generality that F E F and that m(t) > 0 for all t. Indeed, to guarantee 
the periodicity one makes a time reparametrization as it is explained in the 
beginning of this section. The justification of the second assumption is given in 
the next section. Denote by C the space of all C 1-smooth orientation preserving 
diffeomorphisms of 8 1 which fix O. Note that for a E C the path fa = {faCt)} is 
generated by the normalized Hamiltonian function Fa(x, t) = a'(t)F(x, a(t)), 

5.2. Regularization

We conclude that IllFa III :::; p(:ll, ¢) + E. Approximating a in the C 1-topology by 
a smooth diffeomorphism from C we see that one can find a smooth normalized 
Hamiltonian, say F, which generates ¢ and such that IIIFIII :::; p(:ll,¢) + 2E. 
Since this can be done for an arbitrary E we conclude that r(:ll, ¢) :::; p(:ll, ¢). 
This completes the proof. 
D 
Proof of 5.l.B. Write {It} for the Hamiltonian flow generated by F. Let {gd 
be any other Hamiltonian flow generated by G E F with g1 = ¢ F. Decompose 
gt as ht 0 ft. It follows from 5.1.A that {hd is a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms, that is its normalized Hamiltonian H belongs to F and ha = h1 = :ll. 
Vice versa, for every loop {ht} the flow {ht 0 ft} is generated by a Hamiltonian 
from F,1 and its time one map equals ¢F. Further, 
G(x, t) = H(x, t) + F(hi1x, t). 
Set H'(x, t) = -H(htx, t). Note that H' generates a loop {hi1}, and thus 
belongs to H. On the other hand the expression for G above implies that 
IIIGIII = IIIF - H'III· In view of the discussion above to each G corresponds 
unique H' and vice versa. Thus the required statement follows immediately 
from Lemma 5.1.C. 
D 
5.2 
Regularization 
Here we justify the assumption m(t) > 0 made in the proof of Lemma 5.1.C. 
A flow {It} is called regular iffor every t the normalized Hamiltonian function 
Ft does not vanish identically. In other words, for every t the tangent vector 
to the path {It} does not vanish. 
INote that in general the flow {It 0 ht} (mind the order) is not generated by a periodic 
Hamiltonian! 

40 
Chapter 5. Linearization 
Proposition 5.2.A. Let {It} be a flow generated by a Hamiltonian from F. 
Then there exists an arbitrary small (in the Coo-sense) loop {ht } such that 
the flow {hi 1 ft} is regular. 
The proof is divided in several steps. 
1) Let us analyze the problem. Assume that {ht } is a loop generated by a 
Hamiltonian H E 1i. Then the Hamiltonian of the flow {hi 1 fd is given by 
-H(htx, t) + F(htx, t). We have to prove that for every t this expression does 
not vanish identically. But this is equivalent to the assertion that 
F(x, t) - H(x, t) oj. 0 
(5.2.B) 
for all t. So our task is to produce an arbitrary small H E 1i which satisfies 
5.2.B. 
2) Let us introduce another useful notion. A k-parameter variation of the 
constant loop is a smooth family of loops {ht ( E) }, where E belongs to a neigh-
bourhood of 0 in IRk and ht(O) = n for all t. When M is open we assume in 
addition that the supports of all ht(E) are contained in some compact subset 
ofM. 
Here is a convenient way to produce variations. Let us start with the 
I-parameter case. Take a function G E F such that 
11 G(x, t)dt = 0 
(5.2.C) 
for every x E M. Then define ht(E) E Ham(M,n) as the time-E-map of the 
Hamiltonian flow generated by the time-independent Hamiltonian function 
J~ G(x, s)ds. 
Exercise 5.2.D. Let H(x, t, E) be the normalized Hamiltonian function of the 
loop {ht(E)}. Show that 
o 
OE IE=oH(x, t, E) = G(x, t). 
It is natural to construct k-parameter variations as compositions of 1-
parameter variations: 
ht(E1, ... , Ek) = hF)(Ed 0··· 0 h~k)(Ek). 
Here every h(j) is constructed with the help of a function G(j) as above. 
Exercise 5.2.D yields that the partial derivative of the Hamiltonian H(x, t, E) 
with respect to Ej at E = 0 equals G(j). 
3) Fix a point y EM, and consider the 2n-dimensionallinear space E = T; M. 
Choose 2n smooth closed curves 0:1 (t), ... , 0:2n (t) (where t E 8 1 ) which satisfy 
the following conditions: 

5.3. Paths in a given homotopy class 
41 
• fol cxj(t)dt = 0 for all j = 1, ... , 2n; 
• the vectors CXl(t), ... ,CX2n(t) are linearly independent for every t. 
Here is a construction of such a system of curves. Choose a basis Ul, VI, ... , 
Un, Vn in E and take curves of the form Uj cos 21ft+vj sin 21ft and -Uj sin 21ft + 
Vj cos 21ft. 
4) Choose now functions G 1 (x, t), ... , G2n (x, t) from F which satisfy condi-
tion 5.2.C above and such that dyG~j) = CXj(t). Take the corresponding 2n-
parameter variation {ht ( E)} of the constant loop as in step 2. Consider the 
mapping <P : 8 1 X ]R.2n(El,"" E2n) ----+ E defined by 
It follows that <P is a submersion in some neighbourhood U of the circle {E = O}. 
Indeed, our construction together with the discussion in step 2 imply that 
But these vectors generate the whole E. Denote by W the restriction of <P 
to 8 1 X U. Since W is a submersion, the set w- l (O) is a one-dimensional 
submanifold of 8 1 x U, so its projection to U is nowhere dense. Thus there exist 
arbitrary small values of the parameter E such that dy (Ft - Ht (E)) i- 0 for all 
t. Therefore for every t the condition 5.2.B above is satisfied. This completes 
the argument.

5.3 
Paths in a given homotopy class 
A homotopy is simply a smooth l~parameter family of paths. We will consider 
homotopies of non-closed paths with fixed end points, as well as homotopies of 
loops based at n, unless otherwise stated. When the manifold M is open we as 
usually assume that supports of all diffeomorphisms appearing in 2-parameter 
families are contained in an ambient compact subset of M. 
Take a function F E F, and denote by {It} the corresponding Hamilto-
nian flow. Consider the quantity 
l (F) = inflength {9t}, 
where the infimum is taken over all Hamiltonian paths {9t}, t E [0; 1] with 
90 = n, 91 = ¢ F which are homotopic to {It} with fixed end points. Let us 
sketch a useful interpretation of this quantity. Consider the universal cover 
Z of (Ham(M, 0), n). It is defined in the standard manner with the minor 

42 
Chapter 5. Linearization 
exception that we consider smooth paths and smooth homotopies only. The 
Finsler structure on Ham(M,O) lifts canonically to the universal cover. This 
gives rise to the notion of the length of a smooth curve on Z, and therefore 
to the distance function p on Z. Denote by II the canonical lift of :n to Z, 
and by ¢F the lift of ¢F associated to the path {It}, t E [0; 1]. With this 
language I(F) = p(ll, ¢~), so this quantity is responsible for the geometry of 
the universal cover. 
Denote by 'He the set of all Hamiltonians from 'H which generate con-
tractible loops. In other words 'He is the path connected component of 0 in 'H. 
Theorem 5.3.A. For every F E :F 
I(F) = inf IIIF - Hili· 
HE'Hc 
This can be proved exactly in the same way as Theorem 5.1.E above. 
In the course of the proof one should take into account the following simple 
additional observations: 
• Time reparametrizations as well as the regularization procedure 5.2 do 
not change the homotopy class of a path with fixed end points. Thus one 
reduces the problem to the minimization of IIIGIII over all G E :F with 
¢c = ¢F whose Hamiltonian flow is homotopic to {It} (cf. 5.1.e above) . 
• If gt = ht 0 it, where {It} and {gt} are homotopic with fixed end points, 
then the loop ht is contractible (cf. the final argument in the proof of 
5.l.B). 
The details of the proof are left to the reader. 

Chapter 6 
Lagrangian Intersections 
The theory of Lagrangian intersections studies one of the most surprising phe-
nomena in symplectic topology. In this chapter we review some results from 
this theory which being combined with the linearization idea above give a 
rather powerful tool for investigation of the geometry of the group of Hamil-
tonian diffeomorphisms. 
6.1 
Exact Lagrangian isotopies 
Let (V2n , w) be a symplectic manifold and let N n be a closed manifold. Let 
<I> : N x [0,1] ---t V 
be a smooth family of Lagrangian embeddings i.e. cJ> is a Lagrangian isotopy. 
Note that <I>*w must be of the form as /\ ds where {as} is a family of I-forms 
on N (since <I>*w vanishes on the fibers N x {point} ). Furthermore, observe 
that d<I>*w = das /\ ds = 0 which implies that as is closed for all s. 
Definition. A Lagrangian isotopy <I> is exact if as is exact for all s. 
Exercise 6.1.A. Show that a Lagrangian isotopy is exact if and only if it can be 
extended to an ambient Hamiltonian isotopy of V. Hint: Write as = dHs on 
N and extend Hs 0 <I>;1 to a time dependent normalized Hamiltonian function 
on V. 
Example. Let V be a surface and N = 8 1. Then <I> is exact if and only if 
the oriented area between <I>(N x {O}) and <I>(N x {s}) vanishes for all s. See 
Figure 6 for the case V = 8 2 , and Figure 7 for the case V = T* 8 1 = IR X 8 1. 
Note that in the case of the cylinder it is possible to find a symplectic isotopy 
describing the right-hand side picture.

The next result plays an important role in our study of Hofer's geometry.

ated by H E 1t. Let L c M be a closed Lagrangian submanifold. Consider the

(x, t) 1-+ (htx, -H(htx, t), t). 
Our aim is to investigate the behaviour of this Lagrangian embedding un-
der a I-parameter deformation. Let {ht,s}, S E [0; 1] be a smooth family of 
Hamiltonian loops. Denote by 
<.P : L x 8 1 X [0; 1] ----t M x T* 8 1 
the corresponding family of Lagrangian suspensions.

Theorem 6.1.B. The Lagrangian isotopy If> is exact. 
In other words, a homotopy of Hamiltonian loops gives rise to an exact La-
grangian isotopy of Lagrangian suspensions. The proof of the theorem is based 
on the following auxiliary result. Denote by H(x, t, s) the normalized Hamil-
tonian of the loop {ht,s}.

and y is a point of L. In order to prove that the form O:s is exact it suffices 
to verify that its integrals over all I-cycles vanish. For the cycles of the form 
C this follows from the fact that ho,s == n for all s. Thus the exercise above 
implies that O:s vanishes on all vectors tangent to L x {O}. Further, 
This expression vanishes in view of Proposition 6.l.C above. This completes

6.2 
Lagrangian intersections 
We say that a Lagrangian sub manifold N c V has the Lagrangian intersection 
property if N intersects its image under any exact Lagrangian isotopy. In view 
of 6.l.A above one can reformulate this as Nn¢(N) =I- 0 for all ¢ E Ham(V, w), 
or in other words the displacement energy of N is infinite: e(N) = +00. 
Examples 
6.2.A. Infinitesimal Lagrangian intersection problem 
Let F be an autonomous Hamiltonian function on V and let ~ = sgradF be 
its Hamiltonian vector field. Then ~ is tangent to N exactly at critical points 
of FIN (exercise). Since N is closed, FIN must have critical points and hence 
one cannot displace N by an infinitesimal Hamiltonian isotopy. 
6.2.B. Gromov's Theorem 
If 7l'2(V, N) = 0 and V has "nice" behaviour at infinity (say V is a product 
of a closed manifold and a cotangent bundle), Gromov [GI] (see also Floer 

6.2. Lagrangian intersections 
47 
[F]) showed that N has the Lagrangian intersection property. In particular, 
this applies to the circle {r = O} in T* 8 1 (of course, this can be shown by 
an elementary area control, see Figure 7 and the discussion above). More 
generally, this holds for every non-contractible curve on an oriented surface. 
A proof of Gromov's theorem was sketched in 3.2.G above. We refer to [AL, 
Chap. X] for the details. 
If 7r2(V, N) oF 0, the Lagrangian intersection property can be violated. 
Take for example a circle N of tiny area on V = 8 2 and displace it, see 
Figure 8. 
0-0

Figure 8 
However, the Lagrangian intersection property obviously holds for the 
equator (use that the equator divides the sphere into two discs of equal area). 
Definition 6.2.C. Let L be a closed Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic 
manifold (M, 0). We say that L has the stable Lagrangian intersection property 
if L x {r = O} has the Lagrangian intersection property in (M x T* 8 1 , n + 
dr f\ dt). 
Let us give two examples which play an important role in the next chap-
ters. 
6.2.D. Tori in T*']['n. 
Consider a Lagrangian torus in the cotangent bundle T*']['n endowed with the 
standard symplectic structure (see 3.l.C above). Assume that it is homologous 
to the zero section. It is easy to check that the topological assumption of 
Theorem 6.2.B holds in this situation. Therefore such tori have the stable 
Lagrangian intersection property. 
6.2.E The equator of 82 . 
The stable Lagrangian intersection property also holds for equators of 8 2 . This 
follows from a difficult theorem due to Oh ([01], [02]) based on a clever version 
of Floer homology. 

48 
Chapter 6. Lagrangian Intersections 
I do not know an example of a closed connected Lagrangian submanifold which 
has the Lagrangian intersection property, but does not have the stable one. 
6.3 
An application to Hamiltonian loops 
Let (M,O) be a symplectic manifold. Assume that L C M is a closed La-
grangian submanifold which has the Lagrangian intersection property. Let {gt} 
be a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms generated by a Hamiltonian G E 'H. 
Assume in addition that 
• gt(L) = L for all t E 8 1; 
• G(x,t) = 0 for all x E L,t E 8 1. 
An obvious example of such a loop is the constant loop gt == n. A less straight-
forward example will be given in 6.3.C below. 
Theorem 6.3.A. Let {ht } be any other loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
homotopic to {gt} as above. Let H E 'H be its Hamiltonian function. Then 
there exist x ELand t E 8 1 such that H(x, t) = o. 
As we will see in the next chapter, this result gives rise to non-trivial 
lower bounds for Hofer's distance. 
Proof. Apply twice the Lagrangian suspension construction to L, first using 
{gt} and then using { ht }. Denote by N G and N H the corresponding Lagrangian 
sub manifolds of M x T* 8 1. From the formula for the Lagrangian suspension we 
learn that N G = Lx {r = o}. Theorem 6.l.B above implies that N H is isotopic 
to N G by an exact Lagrangian isotopy. Thus the stable Lagrangian intersection 
property yields that NHnNG i- 0. Let (x, 0, t), x E L be the intersection point. 
Since it lies on N H we have that x = hty and 0 = - H(hty, t, 0) for some y E L. 
We conclude that H(x, t) = o.

Recall that 'He denotes the space of all 1-periodic Hamiltonians which 
generate a contractible loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. As an immediate 
consequence of the theorem above we get the following result. 
Corollary 6.3.B. Let L C M be a closed Lagrangian submanifold which has 
the stable Lagrangian intersection property. Then for every H E 'He there exist 
x ELand t E 8 1 such that H(x, t) = o. 
For instance this is true when M = 8 2 and L is the equator of 8 2 . Note that 
the statement of the corollary in general becomes wrong if we do not assume 
the (stable) Lagrangian intersection property. 
Example 6.3.C. Consider the Euclidean space 1R3 (Xl, x2, X3). Let M = 8 2 be 
the unit sphere in the space endowed with the induced area form. The full 

6.3. An application to Hamiltonian loops 
49 
I-turn rotation around the x3-axis is a Hamiltonian loop generated by the 
normalized Hamiltonian function Fl (x) = 27rX3' (The reader can check this 
using our calculation in 1.4.H above.) Thus the k-turn rotation is generated 
by Hamiltonian Fk(X) = 27rkx3. Since Fk vanishes identically on the equator 
L = {X3 = O}, it must vanish on every simple closed curve on 8 2 which divides 
the sphere into two parts of equal areas. Note now that when k is even the 
k-turn rotation of 8 2 represents a contractible loop in 80(3), and therefore 
in Ham(82). On the other hand H == 27rkf on the circle C€ = {X3 = f}. 
We conclude that the phenomenon described in 6.3.B above is very rigid. It 
disappears completely when one considers circles which divide the sphere into 
parts of arbitrarily close but non-equal areas. Indeed, given any positive f, 
choose k such that Fk restricted to C€ is arbitrarily large! The crucial point, of 
course, is that the circle C€ does not have the Lagrangian intersection property. 
One can displace it by an element of 80(3) (cf. Figure 8 above). 

Chapter 7 
Diameter 
In the present chapter we prove that the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
of a closed oriented surface has infinite diameter with respect to Hofer's metric. 
7.1 
The starting estimate 
Let (M,O) be a symplectic manifold, and let L c M be a closed Lagrangian 
submanifold with the stable Lagrangian intersection property. Let F c F be 
a Hamiltonian function such that IF(x, t)1 :::: e for all x ELand t E 8 1. Here 
e is a positive constant. The next proposition gives a lower bound for the 
quantity l(F) = pen, ¢F) introduced in 5.3 above. 
Proposition 7.1.A. Under these assumptions l(F) :::: e. 
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of 5.3.A and 6.3.B above. Indeed, 
6.3.B states that every function H E 'He vanishes at some point (y, T) where 
y ELand T E 8 1. Thus IF(y,T) - H(y,T)1 :::: e and hence IIIF - Hili:::: e. 
Since this holds true for every HE 'He we conclude from 5.3.A that l(F) :::: en 
We wish to extend the estimate above to p(ll, ¢F). Note that if the group 
Ham(M,O) is simply connected with respect to the (strong Whitney) e oo_ 
topology then all paths with common end points are homotopic and therefore 
l(F) = P(ll,¢F)' If the fundamental group 7r1(Ham(M,O)) is non-trivial then 
in general there is no hope to extend estimate 7.l.A without some additional 
information. Indeed, it could happen that in the situation described above 
there exists a shorter path joining II with ¢F, which of course cannot be ho-
motopic to the flow {It}, t E [0; 1] generated by F. It turns out however that 
in some interesting cases one can go round this difficulty. In order to do this 
we have to look more closely at the fundamental group of Ham(M, 0). 

52 
Chapter 7. Diameter 
7.2 
The fundamental group 
Not much is known about 1Tl(Ham(M,O)). There is a complete picture for 
surfaces (based on classical methods) and some four-dimensional manifolds 
[G1], [A], [AM] (based on Gromov's theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves). 
In higher dimensions, only a few partial results are available (actually, I do 
not know any symplectic manifold M of dimension 2: 6 for which one can 
completely describe the fundamental group of Ham(M, 0)). For instance, it is 
known that Ham(JR2n) is simply connected (and in fact, contractible) for n = 
1,2, while nothing is known already for n = 3. We will need the information 
about 1Tl(Ham(M,O)), where M is a closed orient able surface. 
7.2.A. The sphere (cf. 1.4.H and 6.3.C above). 
The inclusion SO(3) ---> Ham(S2) induces the isomorphism of fundamental 
groups. In particular, 1Tl (Ham(S2)) equals 2 2 . The non-trivial element is gen-
erated by the I-turn rotation of the sphere around the vertical axis. 
7.2.B. Surfaces of genus 2: 1. 
In this case one can show that the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is 
simply connected. 
These facts are well known to experts, but it seems to me that they have 
not appeared in published form. Thus I will outline the argument and give 
some auxiliary references with the hope that this will enable the reader to 
reconstruct the proof. We write Diffo(M) (resp. SymPo(M)) for the identity 
component of the group of all (resp. symplectic) diffeomorphisms of surface M. 
Sketch of the proof: 
1) The inclusion 1Tl(SymPo(M)) ---> 1Tl(Diffo(M)) is an isomorphism. To see 
this, consider the space X of all area forms on M with total area 1. Fix 
an area form 0 E X. Consider the mapping Diffo(M) ---> X which sends 
a diffeomorphism f to the form rO. One can adjust the proof of Moser's 
stability theorem [MS, pp. 94-95] in order to show that this mapping is a 
Serre fibration. Note that its fiber is nothing else but SymPo(M, 0), and the 
base X is contractible. The desired fact now follows from the homotopy exact 
sequence of the fibration. 
2) The topology of Diffo(M) is known (see [EE]). In particular, this group is 
contractible for surfaces of genus 2: 2. Further, when M = S2 it has SO(3) as 
strong deformation retract, and when M = ']['2 it has ']['2 as strong deformation 
retract (here the torus acts on itself by translations). 
3) The inclusion j : 1Tl (H am(M, 0)) ---> 1Tl (SymPo(M, 0)) is injective (see 
[MS], 10.18 (iii)). In fact this is true for all closed symplectic manifolds. 

7.2. The fundamental group 
53 
4) Let us combine these facts. We immediately get 7.2.B for surfaces of genus 
~ 2. Taking into account that SymPo(82) = Ham(82) (see I.4.C) yields 7.2.A. 
It remains to handle the case of the torus ']['2. 
5) Fix a point y E ']['2, and consider the evaluation map Diffo(']['2) ---t ']['2 which 
sends a diffeomorphism f to f(y). It induces a map eD : 11"1(Diffo(']['2)) ---t 
11"1(']['2). It is easy to see from step 2 that eD is an isomorphism. Consider now 
the restrictions of the evaluation map to Ham(']['2) and Sympo (']['2) , and denote 
by eH and es respectively the induced homomorphisms of the fundamental 
groups. Step I implies that es is an isomorphism. Using step 3 we get that 
eH = es 0 j, where j is injective. It follows from a theorem by Floer that eH 
vanishes (see [LMPI]). Thus 11"1 (Ham(']['2)) = o. The proof is complete.

Theorem 7.2.C. ((P5J) Assume that 
• either M = 8 2 and L C 8 2 is an equator, 
• or M is a closed orientable surface of genus ~ I and L is a non-contractible 
closed curve. 
Let F E :F be a function such that IF(x, t)1 ~ C for all x ELand t E 81, 
where C is a positive constant. Then p( 11, ¢ F) ~ C. 
Proof. If M has genus ~ I then l(F) = p(ll, ¢F) since the group Ham(M, 0) 
is simply connected (use 7.2.B). Thus the result follows from 7.1.A above. If 
M = 8 2 then the non-trivial element of 11"1 (Ham(M, 0)) is represented by the 
I-turn rotation (see 7.2.A). Its Hamiltonian vanishes on L (see 6.3.C). Thus 
Theorem 6.3.A implies that every function from 1i must vanish at some point 
of L x 8 1. The needed statement now follows from 5.1.B above. 
0 
Corollary 7.2.D. The group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed surface 
has infinite diameter with respect to Hofer's metric. 
Indeed, let M and L be as in 7.2.C above, and let B C M be an open disc 
disjoint from L. Take a time-independent Hamiltonian F E :F which is iden-
tically equal to C outside B. The theorem above implies that p(ll, ¢F) 2': C. 
Taking C arbitrarily large we get that the diameter is infinite. Note also that 
in this example the support of ¢F is contained in B. Thus shrinking B and si-
multaneously increasing C we get a sequence of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
which converges to the identity in the CO-sense but diverges in Hofer's metric. 
Let me mention that for a closed surface M of genus ~ I there exist at 
least two other different proofs of the fact that the diameter of Ham(M, 0) is 
infinite. One of them goes as follows. 
Exercise 7.2.E. (see [LM2]). Let F be a normalized Hamiltonian on M. As-
sume that some regular level set of F contains a non-contractible closed curve. 

54 
Chapter 7. Diameter 
Consider the lift It of the corresponding Hamiltonian flow It to the universal 
cover 1\1 of M. Show that there exists E > 0 and a family of discs Dt C 1\1 
of area Et such that ltDt n Dt = 0 for all sufficiently large t. Conclude from 
Theorem 3.2.C above that p(ll, it) ----) +00 when t ----) +00. 
Another proof (see [Sch3]) is based on Floer homology (see Chapter 13 for 
applications of Floer homology to Hofer's geometry). 
Finally, the fact that diam Ham(M, 0) = +00 has been proved for some 
higher-dimensional manifolds (see [LM2], [Sch3], [P5]). In general, however, 
this is still an open problem. 
7.3 
The length spectrum 
As we have seen above, our method provides a lower bound for p(ll, ¢F) when 
we have very precise information on the fundamental group of Ham(M, 0). 
It was already mentioned that no such information is available in dimension 
2 6. Now we will slightly modify the way of arguing and extend the class 
of manifolds where the method works. The next notion is one of the main 
characters of our story. 
Definition 7.3.A. For an element "( E 7rl (Ham(M, 0)) define the norm of "( by 
vb) = inf length {ht}, 
where the infimum is taken over all Hamiltonian loops {ht} which represent 
"(. The set 
is called the length spectrum of Ham(M, 0). 
Exercise 
(i) Show that 7rl(Ham(M, 0)) is always an abelian group (use the same ar-
gument as for finite-dimensional Lie groups). Thus we denote the group 
operation by +, and write 0 for the neutral element. 
(ii) Prove that vb) = v( -"(), and vb + "(') :S vb) + vb'). 
No general statement about the non-degeneracy of v is known at the moment 
(and I would not be surprised by an example of "( i- 0 with vb) = 0, cf. 
example 7.3.B below). Thus, frankly speaking, v is a pseudo-norm, though we 
call it norm. In Chapter 9 below we will describe a method which provides 
lower bounds for v( "(), and in particular enables us to calculate the length 
spectrum for 8 2 . 

7.4. Refining the estimate 
55 
Example 7.3.B. Liouville manifolds. We say that an open symplectic manifold 
(M,O) has the Liouville property if there exists a smooth family of diffeomor-
phisms 
Dc: M ---t M, c E (OJ +00) 
such that Dl = :n and D~O = cO for all c. Such diffeomorphisms Dc are of 
course not compactly supported for c =1= 1. An important class of examples is 
given by cotangent bundles endowed with the standard symplectic structure 
(see 3.1.C above). The diffeomorphism Dc in this situation is just the fiberwise 
homothety (p, q) ---t (cp, q). We claim that the length spectrum of Ham(M, 0) 
equals {O} provided (M,O) has the Liouville property. The proof of the claim 
is based on the following simple fact. 
Exercise. Let {It} be the Hamiltonian flow generated by a normalized Hamilto-
nian F(x, t). Then for every c > 0 the flow {Dc!tD-;I} is again a Hamiltonian 
flow whose normalized Hamiltonian equals cF(D-;lx, t). 
Let {ht } be a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. Consider the family of ho-
motopic loops {DchtD-;I}. It follows from the exercise above that the lengths 
of the loops go to zero when c ---t 0, thus every loop can be homotoped to a 
loop of an arbitrary small length. We conclude that the length spectrum is {O} 
(without any knowledge about the fundamental group ). In the next chapter 
we will discuss this example in the context of classical mechanics. 
7.4 Refining the estimate 
Theorem 7.4.A. Let (M,O) be a symplectic manifold and let L c M be a 
closed Lagrangian submanifold with the stable Lagrangian intersection prop-
erty. Assume that the length spectrum of Ham( M, 0) is bounded from above 
by some K ~ O. Let F E F be a function such that IF(x, t)1 ~ C for all x E L 
and t E 8 1. Then 
p( 11, cP F) ~ C - K. 
Proof. Fix an arbitrary E > O. Let {gt} be a path of Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms which joins :n with cP F. Consider the loop {It 0 g; I }. By our assumption 
this loop is homotopic to a loop {ht } whose length does not exceed K +E. The 
path {It} is homotopic with fixed end points to the composition {ht 0 gt}. 
Therefore 
l(F) :::; length{ht } + length{gt}. 
Since l(F) ~ C in view of 7.1.A we conclude that length{gt} ~ C - K -
E. 
Thus p(:n, CPF) ~ C - K.

Chapter 8 
Growth and Dynamics 
In this chapter we discuss the asymptotic geometric behaviour of one-para-
meter subgroups of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. We describe a 
link between geometry and invariant tori of classical mechanics. 
8.1 
Invariant tori of classical mechanics 
Invariant Lagrangian tori of Hamiltonian dynamical systems play an important 
role in classical mechanics. We start with an obstruction to the existence of 
invariant tori which comes from the geometry of the group of Hamiltonian 
diffeomorphisms (see 8.1.C below). 
Consider the n-dimensional torus Tn endowed with the Euclidean metric 
ds2 = ~j=l dq;. The Euclidean geodesic flow can be described by a Hamiltonian 
system on the cotangent bundle T*1l'n endowed with the standard symplectic 
form n = dp 1\ dq. The Hamiltonian function is given by F(p, q) = ~ Ip12. 
Solving the Hamiltonian system 
{ 
we find the Hamiltonian flow 
p=o 
q=p 
!t(p, q) = (p, q + pt). 
Let us describe the dynamics of this flow. Every torus {p = a} is invariant 
under Ud, and moreover the restriction of the flow to each such torus is 
simply the (quasi)-periodic motion q ---t q + at. All these tori are homologous 
to the zero section of the cotangent bundle. Geometrically they correspond to 
families of parallel Euclidean lines on Tn. 

58 
Chapter 8. Growth and Dynamics 
The flow above belongs to an important class of time~independent Hamil-
tonian systems called integrable systems (see [Arl). Integrable systems can be 
characterized by the fact that their energy levels are foliated (up to mea-
sure zero) by invariant middle-dimensional tori which carry (quasi)-periodic 
motion. Traditionally this is considered as the simplest pattern of dynamical 
behaviour in classical mechanics. A natural question is what happens to the 
invariant tori when one perturbs the system. The Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser 
theory (or in short KAM theory, see [Ar]) tells us that for small perturbations 
most of the invariant tori persist. One has to require, however, that the ro-
tation vector is "sufficiently irrational". This means, in particular, that if in 
some angular coordinates B on an invariant torus the dynamics is given by 
iJ = a, where a = (al, ... ,an) E ~n, then al, ... ,an should be linearly inde-
pendent over Q. For large perturbations the "topologically essential" tori may 
disappear. For instance, one can deform the Euclidean metric on ']fn to a Rie-
mannian metric such that its geodesic flow has no invariant tori which carry 
quasi-periodic motion and are homologous to the zero section (see [ALl). 
Note that in our starting example the invariant tori {p = a} are La-
grangian. This is a general phenomenon which we are going to explain now. 
Exercise S.1.A. Let F : M ----; ~ be a time independent Hamiltonian on a 
symplectic manifold M. Consider a closed sub manifold L c {H = c}. Show 
that if L is Lagrangian then L is invariant under the Hamiltonian flow of F. 
Hint: use linear algebra in order to prove that sgrad F must be tangent to L. 
In some interesting cases the statement above can be reversed. 
Proposition S.1.B. ({He}) Let F : T*']fn ----; ~ be a time independent Hamil-
tonian. Consider an invariant torus L C {H = c} carrying a quasi-periodic 
motion iJ = a where the coordinates of a are, as before, linearly independent 
over Q. Then L is Lagrangian. 
Proof. Take a point x E L, and assume that OITxL has the form L. bijdBi /\ dBj . 
Since the dynamics is just a shift, B(t) = B(O) + at, we get that OITyL = 
L. bijdBi /\ dBj for every point y which lies on the trajectory of x. Note that 
every trajectory is dense on the torus, so we conclude that 0 = L. bijdBi /\ dBj 
everywhere on L. But OITL is an exact two-form. Hence bij = 0 for all i,j. 
Therefore OITL = 0 and we have shown that L is Lagrangian. 
0 
Let F be a time-independent compactly supported Hamiltonian function 
on (T*']fn,O). Define a number E(F) = sup lEI, where the supremum is taken 
over all E such that the energy level {F = E} contains a Lagrangian torus 
homologous to the zero section. How can one find a non-trivial upper bound 

B.2. Growth of one-parameter subgroups 
59 
for E(F)? Questions of this flavor are studied in the framework of converse 
KAM theory.! Write {It} for the Hamiltonian flow generated by F. 
Theorem 8.1.e. (d (BP2j,{PBj) p(ll,ft) 2': E(F)t for all t E R 
Proof. Note that it suffices to prove the inequality for t = 1 (make a time 
reparametrization). Let L c {H = E} be a Lagrangian torus homologous 
to the zero section. Then L has the stable Lagrangian intersections property 
(see 6.2.D). Since (T*]'n, Q) is a Liouville manifold the length spectrum of 
Ham(M, Q) equals {O} (see 7.3.B). Therefore all the assumptions of Theo-
rem 7.4.A are satisfied. This theorem implies that p(ll,!I) 2': E. Taking the 
supremum over all such E, we get the required estimate. 
0 
The geometric content of this estimate should be understood in a more 
general context of the growth of one-parameter subgroups of Hamiltonian dif-
feomorphisms. 
8.2 
Growth of one-parameter subgroups 
Let (M, Q) be a symplectic manifold, and let {It} be a one-parameter subgroup 
of Ham(M, Q) generated by a normalized Hamiltonian function FE A. One of 
the central problems of Hofer's geometry is to explore interrelations between 
the function p(ll, ft) and the dynamics of the flow {it}. For instance, Theo-
rem S.l.C above states that invariant tori of an autonomous Hamiltonian flow 
on T*]'n which are homologous to the zero section and carry quasi-periodic 
motion contribute to the linear growth of the function p(ll, ft). There exists 
another, purely geometrical reason for the interest in this function. It comes 
from the theory of geodesics of Hofer's metric (see Chapter 12 below). A Hamil-
tonian path {Id is called a strictly minimal geodesic if each of its segments 
minimizes the length between its end points. Conjecturally (see 12.6.A below) 
all sufficiently short segments of anyone-parameter subgroup are strictly mini-
mal geodesics (in other words, everyone-parameter subgroup is locally strictly 
minimal). However as we will see in S.2.H long segments may lose the mini-
mality. The minimality breaking is an intriguing phenomenon which is still 
far from being understood. At present several approaches to this phenomenon 
are known. One of them, based on the theory of conjugate points in Hofer's 
geometry is presented in Chapter 12. Here we discuss an approach based on 
the notion of asymptotic growth of a one-parameter subgroup (see [BP2]). The 
asymptotic growth is defined as 
() 
. 
p(ll, ft) 
J-l F = t~~oo tllPll .

KAM studies obstructions to their existence, see e.g. [Mac] and references therein.

Chapter 8. Growth and Dynamics 
Exercise. Show that the limit above exists. Hint: Use that the function p(ll, it) 
is subadditive: p(ll, iHs) ~ p(ll, it) + p(ll, is). 
Clearly, /1(F) always belongs to [0; 1]. If /1(F) < 1 then the path {It} is 
not a strictly minimal geodesic. 
Let us consider several examples of the behaviour of the function p(ll, it). 
It was proved by Hofer [H2] that everyone-parameter subgroup of Ham(JR2n) is 
locally strictly minimal. On the other hand Sikorav [S2] discovered the striking 
fact that each such subgroup remains a bounded distance of identity, and thus 
cannot be globally strictly minimal. 
Theorem 8.2.A. Let {It} be a one-parameter subgroup ofHam(JR2n) generated 
by a compactly supported Hamiltonian function F. Assume that the support 
of F is contained in a Euclidean ball of radius r. Then the function p( 11, it) is 
bounded: p( 11, it) ~ 1671T2. 
We refer the reader to [HZ, p. 177] for the detailed proof of this theorem (see 
also discussion in 12.6.E below). 
Let us return now to one-parameter subgroups of Ham(T*']fn). First of 
all, it is proved in [LM2] that all of them are locally strictly minimal. In other 
words p(ll, it) = tllFll provided t is small enough. Of course, this implies that 
our estimate 8.1.C above is not sharp for small t. Indeed, in general E(F) is 
strictly smaller than IIFII. Nevertheless, in the case when n = 1 and F 2: 0 
estimate 8.1.C is asymptotically sharp! Notice that since every closed curve on 
the cylinder T*']fl is Lagrangian, the quantity E(F) is simply the supremum of 
those real numbers E for which the level {F = E} contains a non-contractible 
embedded circle. 
Theorem 8.2.B. ([PSJ) Let F be a non-negative compactly supported Hamilto-
nian on the cylinder T*']fl with IIFII = 1. Then the converse KAM parameter 
E(F) coincides with the asymptotic growth f1(F): 
E(F) = f1(F). 
Proof. We have to prove that /1(F) ~ E(F). Combining this with 8.1.C we 
get the desired result. If E(F) = maxF = 1 then 8.1.C yields that /1(F) = 
E(F). Suppose now that E(F) < 1. The idea is to decompose the flow {Id 
into a product of two commuting flows with simple asymptotic behaviour. 
Choose 10 > 0 small enough, and consider a smooth non-decreasing function 
u : [0; +00) -t [0; +00) with the following properties: 
• u(s) = s for s :s:; E(F) + 10; 
• u(s) = E(F) + 210 for s 2: E(F) + 310 ; 
• u(s) :s:; s for all s. 

8.2. Growth of one-parameter subgroups 
61 
Consider the new Hamiltonians G = u 0 F and H = F - G, and denote by 
{9t} and {ht} the corresponding Hamiltonian flows. These flows commute and 
It = 9tht. Thus 
p(ll, It) ~ p(ll, 9t) + p(ll, ht). 
(S.2.C) 
Note that IIGII ~ E(F) + 2E, thus 
p(ll, 9t) ~ t(E(F) + 2E). 
(S.2.D) 
Further, the support of H is contained in a subset DE = {F 2: E(F) + E}. For 
a generic sufficiently small E the set DE is a domain whose boundary consists 
of contractible closed curves (we use here the definition of E(F)). Assume now 
that the support of F is contained in an annulus 
A = {(p, q) E T*1l'l ilql ~ a/2} 
for some a > O. Note that aDE C A. Hence the set DE is contained in some set 
D' C A which is a finite union of pairwise disjoint closed discs of total area 
at most a. Since the cylinder has the infinite area, it is an easy consequence 
of the Dacorogna-Moser theorem [HZ, Sect. 1.6] that there exists a symplectic 
embedding i : ]R2 --+ T*1l'l, and a finite union D" C ]R2 of Euclidean discs 
such that i maps D" diffeomorphically on D'. Clearly, i induces the natural 
homomorphism 
i* : Ham(]R2) --+ Ham(T*1l'l). 
It is important to notice that i* does not increase the corresponding Hofer 
distances. Our flow ht lies in the image of i*, i.e., ht = i* (et) where et is a 
one---parameter subgroup of Ham(]R2) whose Hamiltonian is supported in D". 
Thus Theorem S.2.A above implies that 
p(ll, ht ) ~ 16a. 
Combining this inequality with (8.2.D) and (8.2.C) we get that 
p(ll, It) ~ t(E(F) + 2E) + 16a 
(8.2.E) 
for all t > O. Dividing by t and passing to the limit when t --+ +00 we get that 
f.L(F) ~ E(F) + 2E. Since E is arbitrary small, this completes the proof. 
0 
Remark 8.2.F. The same proof shows that if E(F) = 0 then the function 
p(ll, It) is bounded. Indeed, since (8.2.E) holds for all E > 0 we get that 
p(ll, It) ~ 16a. In view of the inequality E(F) ~ f.L(F) this implies the fol-
lowing "rigidity" -type statement: il f.L(F) = 0 then p(ll, It) is bounded (see S.4 
below for further discussion). 

62 
Chapter 8. Growth and Dynamics 
Theorem 8.2.B and Remark 8.2.F hold true for all open surfaces of infinite area 
(see [PS]). Moreover, one can easily modify the definition of E(F) and extend 
these statements to arbitrary (not necessarily non-negative) Hamiltonians F. 
At the moment, no generalization of 8.2.B to higher dimensions is known. The 
next discussion shows however that estimate 8.1.e is sharp at least in the 
following very special situation. 
Let F : T*1fn ----) lR be a compactly supported time independent Hamil-
tonian function which satisfies the following conditions: 
(i) F"2 0 
(ii) maxF = 1 
(iii) the maximum set I; = {F = I} is a smooth section of the cotangent 
bundle. 
It turns out that the geometry of the corresponding flow {td drastically de-
pends on whether I; is Lagrangian or not! 
Suppose that I; is a Lagrangian submanifold. Then by definition E(F) = 
1. Therefore Theorem 8.1.e above implies that {tt} is a strictly minimal 
geodesic, and in particular E(F) = M(F). 
Assume now that I; is not Lagrangian, that is n does not vanish at least 
on one tangent space to I;. In this case it is unknown whether M(F) equals 
E(F) or not. However we claim that estimate 8.1.e is at least non-trivial, 
namely 
E(F) ~ M(F) < 1. 
(8.2.G) 
In order to explain this inequality, we need the following fairly general 
result which in some interesting situations allows us to show that M(F) is 
strictly less than 1. 
Theorem 8.2.H. Let F be a time-independent normalized Hamiltonian on a 
symplectic manifold (M,O). Let I;+ and I;_ be the maximum and the min-
imum sets of F respectively. Suppose that there exists ¢ E Ham(M, O) such 
that either ¢(I;+) n I;+ = 0 or ¢(I;_) n I;_ = 0. Then M(F) < 1, and in 
particular the Hamiltonian flow of F is not a strictly minimal geodesic. 
The proof is given in 8.3 below. 
Let us sketch the proof of 8.2.G. One can show that since I; is not La-
grangian there exists a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism ¢ such that ¢(I;) n I; = 0. 
Thus combining Theorems 8.1.e and 8.2.H we get that E(F) ~ M(F) < 1. The 
proof of the existence of the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism ¢ which displaces 
the non-Lagrangian submanifold I; is complicated. It is based on Gromov's 
h-principles for partial differential relations. In fact one can even show more, 
namely that the displacement energy of I; vanishes. We refer the reader to 
[P2], [LS] for the proof of this result and its generalizations. 

8.3. Curve shortening in Hofer's geometry 
63 
Let us mention also that Siburg [Si2] extended inequality s.1.e to time-
dependent Hamiltonian flows. Note that in the time-dependent case it is already 
non-trivial to define the converse KAM-type parameter because of the lack of 
the energy conservation. Siburg's definition is based on the concept of minimal 
action developed by Mather.

Theorem S.2.H above is an immediate consequence of this result. Indeed, if F 
satisfies the assumptions of S.2.H then 6(F) < 1. 
Proof of 8.3.A. Without loss of generality, assume that IIPII = 1. Take ¢ E 
Ham(M,O) and T > O. Write 
hT = (fr 0 ¢ 0 fr 0 ¢ -1) 0 (¢ 0 f T 1 0 ¢ -1 0 fr ) = A 0 B. 
Observe that B is a commutator so p(n, B) :::; 2p(n, ¢). The diffeomorphism 
A is generated by a path gt = ft¢ft¢-l for t E [0, T] and the corresponding 
Hamiltonian is 
So we have

Chapter 8. Growth and Dynamics 
We refer the reader to [LM2] and [P9] for various curve shortening pro-
cedures in Hofer's geometry. We will return to this issue in Chapter 11 below.

that on a closed symplectic manifold 8N (F) ----+ 0 when N ----+ +00 for every 
function F E A. I do not know the decay rate of the sequence 8 N (F). 
8.4 What happens when the asymptotic 
growth vanishes? 
As we have seen in 8.2.F above, on the cylinder (and more generally, on 
open surfaces of infinite area) everyone-parameter subgroup whose asymptotic 
growth vanishes remains a bounded distance of the identity. What happens on 
other symplectic manifolds? 
Problem S.4.A. Does there exist a symplectic manifold (M, D) and a one-
parameter subgroup {Jd of Ham(M, D) such that the function p(:n, it) has an 
intermediate asymptotic at infinity (for instance, it grows like ..;t)? 
This problem is open even for such an elementary symplectic manifold as the 
2-torus 'JI'2. The only excuse is that the functions F E A('JI'2) with j..t(F) = 0 
are non-generic, as the next result shows. 
Theorem S.4.B. Assume that 0 is a regular value of FEA('JI'2). Then p,(F) >0. 
Proof. The set D = {F = O} consists of a finite number of pairwise disjoint 
embedded circles. Thus there exists a non-contractible simple closed curve 
L C 'JI'2 such that L n D = 0. Thus for some C > 0 we have that IF(x)1 > C 
for all x E L. Since 7rl(Ham('JI'2)) = 0 (see 7.2.B), it follows from 7.4.A that 
p(:n, it) 2 Ct for all t, and in particular j..t(F) > O.

Length Spectrum 
In this chapter we describe a method of calculation of the length spectrum in 
Hofer's geometry. Our approach is based on the theory of symplectic fibrations 
over the 2-sphere.

where the infimum is taken over all normalized periodic Hamiltonians F E H 
which generate a loop representing "I. The correctness of this definition can be 
proved exactly in the same way as Lemma 5.1.C above. 
Exercise. Prove that v+b) = v_( -"I), and vb) 2': v-b) + v+b) (d. the open 
problem in 2.4 above). 
The calculation of v+b) turns out to be non-trivial even in the following 
simplest case. Consider (82,0) normalized so that fS2 0 = 1. Let "I be the class 
of the I-turn rotation {fd, and let F E H be the Hamiltonian generating {fd. 
We have seen in 6.3.C above that maxF = - minF = ~. (The factor 271' in 
6.3.C disappeared in view of the normalization of 0 above.) Thus v+b) :s ~. 
In fact equality holds! 
Theorem 9.1.A. v+b) = ~.

Chapter 9. Length Spectrum 
A Hamiltonian loop Utl representing a class '"'( 1= 0 is called a closed minimal 
geodesic if lengthUtl = vh). Note that a closed minimal geodesic is never 
strictly minimal. 
Corollary. ((LM2J) vh) = 1 and Utl is a closed minimal geodesic.

Theorem 9.1.A is proved in 9.4 below. We refer to [P3] for generalizations 
tocpn, n2:2. 
9.2 
Symplectic fibrations over 8 2 
Let (M, 0) be a closed symplectic manifold. We will assume from now on1 that 
H1(M,JR.) = O. As a consequence Ham(M,O) coincides with the connected 
component of n in Symp(M, 0). Let p : P -t 8 2 be a smooth fibration with 
fiber M endowed with a fiberwise symplectic structure as follows. For each 
x E 8 2 , p-1(X) is endowed with a symplectic form Ox such that Ox depends 
smoothly on x and (p-1(X), Ox) is symplectomorphic to (M, 0). In addition, we 
always choose an orientation on 8 2 as part of the data (so P is also oriented). 
We call p : P -t 8 2 a symplectic fibration (for more details see [MS]). 
Every loop Ut} of Hamiltonian difIeomorphisms of M gives rise to a 
symplectic fibration. Take two copies of the unit 2-disc D!, D=- such that D! 
is endowed with the positive orientation and D=- with the reversed one. Define 
a new manifold 
p = M x D~ U,p M x D~ 
where 'ljJ is the gluing map 
'ljJ : M x 8 1 -t M X 8 1 , (z, t) I----t (ftZ, t). 
Clearly P has the natural structure of a symplectic fibration over 8 2 since the 
It are symplectomorphisms (and moreover 8 2 gets an orientation in the result 
of this construction). 
1 It is not hard to get rid of this assumption, see the theory of Hamiltonian symplectic 
fibrations in [MS] and [P4]. 

9.2. Symplectic Ebrations over 3 2 
67 
Homotopic loops lead to isomorphic symplectic fibrations i.e. there exist 
smooth isomorphisms preserving the fiberwise symplectic structure and the 
orientation. Furthermore, the construction can be reversed. Given a fibration 
P ----) 3 2 together with a trivialization over one point, one can reconstruct the 
homotopy class 'Y. Note also that the class 'Y = 0 corresponds to the trivial 
fibration 3 2 x (M,O). We leave the proof of these statements to the reader. 
We shall write P = Ph), where 'Y is the homotopy class of {fd. 
Let us visualize the fibration Ph) for the class of the I-turn rotation of 
3 2 . Note that in this case both the base and the fiber are 3 2 . It will be useful 
to identify 3 2 with the complex projective line CP1 and move to the complex 
setting. 
At this point we will make a digression concerning the symplectic geome-
try of complex projective spaces. Let E be a 2n-dimensional real vector space 
endowed with a complex structure j (here j is a linear transformation E ----) E 
with j2 = - n), a scalar product 9 and a symplectic form w such that 
g(~,TJ) = w(~,jTJ) 
for all ~,TJ E E (cf. 4.1 above). Of course, using j we can consider E as a 
complex vector space. The pair (w, g) as above is called a Hermitian structure 
on the complex space (E,j). Take the unit sphere 
Consider the circle action on 3 defined by 
~ ----) e27rjt ~, t E !R/£:. 
The orbits of this action are precisely the sets of the form 3 n I, where I 
is a complex line in E. Thus the space of orbits 3131 can be canonically 
identified with the complex projective space JID( E). The action preserves the 
restriction of w to T3. Denote by 0 the projection of ~w to JID(E). This form 
is closed. Further, an elementary linear algebra argument shows that 0 is 
non-degenerate, and thus we get a symplectic form on JID(E). 
The form 0 is called the standard (or the Fubini-Study) symplectic form 
on JID( E) associated to the Hermitian structure (w, g) on a complex space (E, j). 
The construction above is a particular case of the Marsden-Weinstein reduc-
tion [MS] which plays a fundamental role in the theory of group actions on 
symplectic manifolds. The factor ~ above is chosen for the following reason. 
Exercise 9.2.A. Show that the integral of 0 over a projective line in JID(E) 
equals 1. 
It follows from Moser's theorem [MS] that different Hermitian structures on 
(E,j) give rise to diffeomorphic symplectic forms on JID(E). 

68 
Chapter 9. Length Spectrum 
Exercise 9.2:B. Consider the space Cn endowed with the standard Hermi-
tian structure (see 4.1). Show that the standard symplectic form on JID(Cn ) = 
cpn-l is invariant under the group JlDU(n) = U(n)/S\ and that this group 
acts on cpn-l by Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. Show that 
JlDU(2) = SU(2)/{n; -n}. 
Exercise 9.2.C. Consider a loop of projective unitary transformations of Cpl 
which in homogeneous coordinates (Zl : Z2) on Cpl is given by 
(Zl : Z2) ---t (e-27ritzl : Z2), t E [0; 1]. 
Show that this loop represents the non-trivial element of 7rl(Ham(Cpl )). Hint: 
Use the canonical isomorphism SU(2)/{n; -n} ---t SO(3) (see [DFN]). 
There exists a natural "parametric" version of the construction above 
which allows us to produce symplectic fibrations whose fiber is cpn-l endowed 
with the standard symplectic form. Let E ---t S2 be a complex vector bundle 
of rank n, and let JID(E) be its projectivization. Every Hermitian structure on 
E gives rise to the fiber-wise symplectic form Ox on JID(E). Here Ox equals the 
standard symplectic form on the fiber JID( Ex). Different choices of the Hermitian 
structure lead to isomorphic symplectic fibrations. 
We return now to the symplectic fibration Pb), where "y is the non-trivial 
element of 7rl(Ham(S2)). Let T ---t Cpl be the tautological line bundle i.e. the 
one whose fiber over a complex line in C2 is the line itself. Let C = C X Cpl 
be the trivial bundle. 
Exercise 9.2.D. Prove that the symplectic fibration P( "y) is isomorphic to 
JID(T EB C). Hint: Represent the base Cpl as the union of two discs 
D_ = {(xo : Xl) E cpl Ilxo/Xll ~ I}, 
and 
D+ = {(xo : Xl) E Cpl Ilxdxol ~ I}. 
Introduce a coordinate t on the circle Sl = oD+ = oD_ by xdxo = e27rit. 
The bundle T EB C can be trivialized over D_ and D+ in such a way that the 
transition function Sl x C2 ---t Sl X C2 has the form 
(t, Zl, Z2) ---t (t, e-27ritzl, Z2) 
(see e.g. [GH] for the detailed description of the tautological line bundle). The 
result now follows from 9.2.C above. 
Exercise 9.2.E. Show that JID(T EB C) is biholomorphically equivalent to the 
complex blow up of CP2 at one point. The fibration is obtained by the proper 
transform of the pencil of lines passing through the blown up point.

Symplectic connections 
Let p : P -t S2 be a symplectic fibration with fiber (M,O). A connection (J 
on P (that is a field of 2-dimensional subs paces transversal to the fibers, see 
Figure 9), is called symplectic if the parallel transport preserves the fiberwise 
symplectic structure. One can show that every symplectic fibration admits a 
symplectic connection, see [GLS], [MSj.

Example. Let E -t 8 2 be a complex vector bundle endowed with a Hermitian 
metric. Every Hermitian connection on E induces a symplectic connection on 
the projectivized bundle JP(E) -t 8 2 • 
Recall the definition of curvature of a connection. For x E 8 2 and ~, "7 E 
Tx82 L extend ~ and "7 locally in a neighbourhood of x and consider horizontal 
lifts ~,fJ of the obtained vector fields. By definition, the curvature pfJ at the 
point x is a 2-form which takes values in the Lie algebra of vector fields on the 
fiber p-I(X). So pfJ(~,"7) = ([~,fJ])vert, where "vert" denotes the projection of 
[~,fJj onto the fiber p-I(X). Thus if (J is a symplectic connection, then pfJ(~,"7) 
lies in the Lie algebra of Symp(p-I(x)), that is pfJ(~, "7) is a Hamiltonian vector 
field since HI (M, 1R) = O. Identifying the Hamiltonian vector fields with the 
normalized Hamiltonian functions, we shall consider pfJ (~, "7) as a normalized 
function 
Fix an area form T on 8 2 such that fS2 T = 1 (here we need the orientation of 
8 2 ). Since every 2-form on 8 2 is a multiple of T we can write 
where LfJ is a function on P. 

70 
Chapter 9. Length Spectrum 
The theory of symplectic connections has been recently developed by 
Guillemin, Lerman and Sternberg (see [GLS], [MS]). As fundamental objects 
of this theory arise the coupling form of a symplectic connection and the 
coupling class of a symplectic fibration. For a point (x, z) E P we can write 
which is the decomposition with respect to the symplectic connection (J". 
Define the coupling form 80" of the connection (J" as the 2-form on P given by 
Here Z E p-l(x), V,W E Tzp-l(X) and ~,'fJ E Tx82, while pO"(~,'fJ) is considered 
as a function on the fiber p-l(X). 
It turns out that the coupling form is closed. Denote by c its cohomology 
class in H2(P,~). Obviously the restriction of c to any fiber p-l(x) coincides 
with the class [nx ] of the symplectic form. Furthermore, one can prove that 
cn +! = 0 where 2n = dimM. The next result shows that the class c is uniquely 
determined by these two properties. 
Theorem 9.3.A. (See [GLSj, [MSj) The class c is the unique cohomology class 
in H2(p,~) such that cl.fiber = [nx] and cn+! = o. 
In particular, c is an invariant of the symplectic fibration P which does not 
depend on the choice of the connection (J". We call c the coupling class of P. 
Detailed proofs of all these results can be found in [GLS], [MS]. 
The next construction plays an important role in our approach to the 
length spectrum. 
The weak coupling construction. ([GLSj, [MSJ) For c: > 0 sufficiently small 
there exists a smooth family of closed 2-forms Wt on P with t E [0, c:) such that 
• Wo = P*T 
• [Wt] = tc + P*[T] 
• Wtlflber = tnx 
• Wt is symplectic for all t > o. 
Set c:(P) = supc:, where the supremum is taken over all such deforma-
tions. This quantity measures how strong the weak coupling can be. Note that 
for a trivial fibration, P = M X 8 2, c:(P) = +00. Thus in a sense c:(P) measures 
the non-triviality of the fibration. 
There is another way to measure the non-triviality, which works for fi-
brat ions with other structure groups as well. It was suggested by Gromov [G2] 
for unitary vector bundles and we will here give a symplectic version. The 

9.3. Symplectic connections 
71 
idea is to measure the minimal possible norm of the curvature of a symplectic 
connection on P. We will introduce the following concept. 
Definition.

is the (positive part of the) symplectic K-area of P. Here the supremum is 
taken over all symplectic connections on P, and La is defined by pa = LaT. 
Exercise. Prove that both quantities introduced above, c:(P) and x+ (P), do not 
depend on the particular choice of the area form T on S2 with IS2 T = 1. Hint: 
First apply Moser's theorem [MSj which states that given any two such forms, 
say Tl and T2, there exists a diffeomorphism a of S2 isotopic to the identity 
such that a*T2 = Tl. Then lift a to a fiber-wise symplectic diffeomorphism A 
of P, which means that p(A(z)) = a(p(z)) for all z E P and the restriction 
Ax of A to any fiber p-l(X) satisfies (Ax)*Oa(x) = Ox. Such a lift can be 
constructed with the help of any symplectic connection on P. Note that A takes 
any weak coupling deformation associated to T2 to a weak coupling deformation 
associated to Tl. This proves that c:(P) does not depend on the choice of the 
area form. Further, A acts on the space of symplectic connections on P by 
(T --t A* (T. Show that 
for every point z E P and every pair of vectors ~,rt E Tp( z) S2. The fact that 
X + (P) does not depend on the choice of the area form is a simple consequence 
of this formula. 
Theorem 9.3.B. ((P4J) Let P = Pb)· Then c:(P) = X+(P) = 1/+(1'). 
We will prove a weaker statement, namely that c:(P) ~ X+(P) ~ 1/+(1')' 
but this will be enough to prove Theorem 9.1.A. 
Proof of c:(P) ~ X+(P). Let (T be a symplectic connection. Consider 
where oa is the coupling form. At the point (x, z) E P, we have 
Wt,(x,z) = tOx EB -tLa(x, Z)T + T = tOx EB (1 - tLa(x, Z))T. 
Clearly, Wt satisfies the first three properties of the weak coupling construction. 
The form Wt is symplectic when 1- tLa(x, z) > 0 or equivalently La(x, z) < t 
for all x, z. This condition means that max La(x, z) < t, or 
p

on P such that wlfiber = nx ' Set 
a(x,z) = {~ E T(x,z)P I i~w = 0 on T zp-1(X)}. 
Show that a defines a symplectic connection on P. 
Let {It}, t E [0,1]' be an arbitrary loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
generated by a normalized Hamiltonian FE 1i. Fix polar coordinates u E (0,1] 
(the radius) and t E 8 1 = IR/Z (the normalized angle) on D2. Take a monotone 
cut off function ¢(u) such that ¢(u) = 0 near u = 0 and ¢(u) = 1 near u = 1.

Exercise. Prove that w is well defined i.e. show that 'IjJ*n = n + dHt 1\ dt (this 
can be done by a direct computation). 
Let us compute the curvature of pO' of the symplectic connection associ-
ated to w. Notice that pO' vanishes on D! (since n induces a fiat connection 
on D!), so it remains to compute pO' on D=-. Note that pO' = 0 near 0 on D=-, 
which is good since we avoid the singularity at zero. In order to compute the 
curvature, we must find the horizontal lifts of !/u and f1t at (x, z) EM x D=-. 
Let the horizontal lift of !/u be of the form

au = au + v for some v E Tzp-1(x).

Since by definition of the connection, we have w( tu' w) = 0 for all w E TzM, 
we have

So ivD = d(¢(u)Ht) and therefore v = - sgrad ¢(u)Ht = -¢(u) sgrad Ht and 
we can deduce that

prJ (%t' :u) = ¢'(u)Ht(z). 
Fix /'i, > 0 and choose the area form on D=- to be (1- /'i, )dt /\ du (remember 
that D=- has the reversed orientation). 
Extend it to an area form on D! such that Area (D!) = /'i,. Denote the

"V c. Obviously, (J" is symplectic (actually, parallel transport preserves both the 
symplectic and the complex structure on the fibers). Let T be the Fubini-Study

Deformations of Symplectic Forms and 
Pseudo-holomorphic Curves 
In the present chapter we prove the upper bound 9.4.A for the coupling param-
eter and therefore complete the calculation of the length spectrum of Ham( 8 2). 
This turns out to be a particular case of a more general problem concerning 
deformations of symplectic forms (see [P7]). We discuss an approach to the de-
formation problem which is based on Gromov's theory of pseudo-holomorphic 
curves. 
10.1 
The deformation problem 
Let (P,w) be a closed symplectic manifold and l a ray in H 2(P,R) with origin 
at [w], see Figure 10. 
Figure 10 
Problem. How far can one deform w through symplectic structures on P in 
such a way that the cohomology class moves along l? 

76 
Chapter 10. Deformations of Symplectic Forms 
Note that adding a small closed 2-form to W leaves it symplectic, but how 
far can one go? In the case of the coupling deformation, the form [p*r] itself is 
degenerate, but for small t, [p*r] + tc is already symplectic. In this situation 
we can go as far along the ray in the direction of the coupling class c as c(P). 
Here is an example of an obstruction to going infinitely far. Assume that 
dim P = 4 and that ~ C P is an embedded 2-sphere such that WIT~ is an area 
form (in other words ~ is a symplectic sub manifold of P). We write (A, B) for 
the intersection index of two homology classes A and B. 
Definition. Let ~ C p 4 be a symplectic embedded sphere. If ([~], [~]) = -1 
we call ~ an exceptional sphere. 
Theorem IO.LA. ([McD 1]) Let ~ C (P4 , w) be an exceptional sphere. Let 
Wt,tE [0,1] be a deformation ofw through symplectic forms. Then ([WI], [~]) > O. 
In other words, the hyperplane (x, [~]) = 0 in H 2(P,IR) is a wall which 
cannot be crossed by a symplectic deformation. 
The proof is based on the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves. Below 
we give a sketch of the proof of this statement as well as an application to the 
proof of 9.4.A. 
10.2 The a-equation revisited 
An almost complex structure j on a manifold P is a field of endomorphisms 
T P ----* T P such that j2 = -ll. An important class of examples comes from 
complex algebraic geometry. Every complex manifold (that is a manifold 
equipped with an atlas whose transition functions are holomorphic) has the 
canonical almost complex structure ~ ----* A~. Almost complex structures 
arising in this way are called integrable. A deep fact is that integrability is 
equivalent to the vanishing of a certain tensor associated to the almost com-
plex structure ([NN]). As a consequence of this result one gets that every 
almost complex structure on a (real) surface is integrable. Moreover, on the 
2-sphere all almost complex structures are diffeomorphic (a classical fact called 
the uniformization theorem [AS]). 
Definition. Let (P,w) be a symplectic manifold. An almost complex structure 
j is compatible with w if g( ~, ry) = w( ~,jry) defines a Riemannian metric on P. 
Exercise 10.2.A. Let (P,w) be a real surface and let j be an almost complex 
structure on P. Then either j or -j is compatible with w. 
Let (P, w) be a symplectic manifold, and let j be a compatible integrable 
almost complex structure on P. The triple (P, w, j) is called a Kahler structure. 
For instance, cpn endowed with the standard wand j is a Kahler manifold 

10.2. The a-equation revisited 
77 
(cf. 9.2 above). Thus every complex submanifold of cpn is Kahler with respect 
to the induced structure. Vice versa, if (P,w,j) is a closed Kahler manifold 
such that the cohomology class [w] is integral, then (P, j) admits a holomor-
phic embedding into cpn for some n (this is the famous Kodaira embedding 
theorem, see [GH]). 
It was Gromov's great insight [GI] that one can generalize some impor-
tant methods in algebraic geometry to quasi-Kahler manifolds (P,w,j). Here 
j is a compatible almost complex structure but in general not integrable any-
more. Remarkably enough, the theory of holomorphic curves extends without 
essential changes to the non-integrable case. The importance of such a gener-
alization is due to the following reason. Every symplectic manifold admits a 
compatible almost complex structure. However there are symplectic manifolds 
which cannot have a Kahler structure (see [MS]). 
Exercise lO.2.B (see [MS]). Let E be an even dimensional linear space endowed 
with a non-degenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form w. Show that the space 
of complex structures j : E ---t E, j2 = - n is contractible. 
Therefore a compatible almost complex structure on a symplectic manifold is 
a section of a fiber bundle whose fibers are contractible. Hence such structures 
do exist and moreover form a contractible space. By the same reason various 
extension problems connected to almost complex structures admit a positive 
solution. 
Exercise lO.2.C. Let (P, w) be a 4-dimensional symplectic manifold, and let 
~ c P be a symplectic submanifold. Assume that ~ is equipped with an almost 
complex structure j which is compatible with wln:- Show that j extends to a 
compatible almost complex structure on P. 
Let us turn now to the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves on quasi-
Kahler manifolds. 
Definition. A map ¢: (52 ,i) ---t (P,j) is a pseudo-holomorphic (or j-holomorphic) 
curve if ¢* 0 i = j 0 ¢*. 
Exercise lO.2.D. Show that on a complex manifold the definition above is 
equivalent to the usual Cauchy-Riemann equation. 
We set 
Exercise lO.2.E(cf. 4.1.A). Given (P,w,j,g) and a j-holomorphic curve ¢ 
(52,i) ---t (P,j), show that Areag(¢(52)) = fS2 ¢*w. In particular, if ¢ is non-
constant then fS2 ¢*w > o. 

78 
Chapter 10. Deformations of Symplectic Forms 
Moreover, if ¢ is an embedding, then ¢(S2) is a symplectic submanifold of P. 
Indeed, the restriction of the symplectic form coincides with the Riemannian 
area form. 
Let (P, w) be a symplectic manifold. Choose an almost complex structure 
j compatible with w. Then the tangent bundle TP gets the structure of a 
complex vector bundle. Since the space of compatible j's is connected the 
corresponding characteristic classes do not depend on the choice of j. We 
write Cl for the first Chern class of T P with respect to any compatible almost 
complex structure. 
Exercise 1O.2.F (Adjunction formula). Let (P4 , w) be a symplectic manifold 
with a compatible almost complex structure j. Let ~ c P be an embedded 
j-holomorphic sphere. Show that 
Hint: Use that ([~], [~]) is the self-intersection in the complex normal bundle 
Vl:, and Tl:,P = T~ EB Vl:,. 
Corollary. For a symplectically embedded sphere ~, Cl = 1 if and only if 
([~], [~]) = -1. 
Proof. Since ~ is symplectically embedded, there exists an w-compatible almost 
complex structure j such that ~ is j-holomorphic (see lO.2.C). The statement 
now follows from the adjunction formula 1O.2.F. 
0 
10.3 
An application to coupling 
In this section we deduce 9.4.A from 1O.1.A. Recall that we study the cou-
pling deformation for the fibration JP'(T EB C) --+ CP 1 , where T and C are the 
tautological and trivial bundle respectively. 
Exercise. Let E be a complex vector space and let I E IP(E) be a line in E. 
Show that TzIP(E) is canonically isomorphic to Hom(l, Ell) = 1* @ Ell. 
First of all, we wish to compute the (co ) homology ring of P = IP(T EB C). 
Denote by [F] the homology class of the fiber and by ~ the section correspond-
ing to the rank 1 subbundle 0 EB C. Clearly, ([F], [F]) = 0 and ([F], [~]) = 1. 
In order to compute ([~], [~]), notice that the normal bundle Vl:, is just the 
restriction on ~ of the tangent bundle to the fibers. The above exercise implies 
that 
Vl:, = Hom(C, T EB C/C) = Hom(C, T) = C* ® T = T. 

10.4. Pseudo-holomorphic curves 
79 
Thus Cl (v~) = -1. We conclude that ([~], [~]) = -1 since ( [~], [~]) is just the 
self-intersection in the normal bundle. 
Let Wt be a coupling deformation. It is an easy consequence of Moser's 
theorem [MS] that for small enough t, Wt is symplectomorphic to a Kahler form 
with respect to the standard complex structure on JPl(T EB C). Without loss of 
generality, we may assume that Wt is a Kahler form for small t. Since ~ is a 
holomorphic section of P, we get that ~ is symplectic and embedded. Taking 
into account that ([~], [~]) = -1 we see that ~ is an exceptional sphere. Thus 
Theorem 10.1.A implies that ([Wt]' [~]) > 0 for all t. 
Recall, that [Wt] = P*[T]+tc, where [T] is a generator of H2(82, Z) coming 
from the orientation and c is the coupling class. The classes P*[T] and care 
uniquely defined by the following relations: 
(P* [T], [F]) = 0 
(c, [F]) = 1 
(P* [T], [~]) = 1 
c2 = O. 
We shall use Poincare duality to identify homology and cohomology. 
Exercise. Prove that P*[T] = [F] and c = [~] + ~[F]. 
Thus, in view of Theorem 10.1.A 
t 
t 
t 
([Wt], [~]) = ([F] + t[~] + 2[F], [~]) = 1 - t + 2 = 1 - 2 > 0, 
which implies that t < 2. Since this is true for any coupling deformation, we 
have proved that c(P) ::; 2. This completes the proof.

10.4 
Some properties of pseudo-holomorphic curves 
in symplectic manifolds 
Here we outline Gromov's theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves (see [G1], 
[ALl). Let (p2n,w) be a symplectic manifold and let A E H2(P,Z) be a prim-
itive class. This means that A cannot be represented as kB where k > 1 is 
an integer and B E H 2(P, Z). In particular, A =I- O. Let .J be the space of all 
w-compatible almost complex structures on P and let N be the space of all 
smooth maps 1 : 8 2 -t P such that [1] = A. Define X c N x .J by 
X = {(I,j)II E N,j E.J and aji = O}. 
Then X is a smooth sub manifold of N x .J and the projection 7r : X -t .J is a 
Fredholm operator i.e. Ker 7r * and Coker 7r * are finite dimensional. Its index 
satisfies 

80 
Chapter 10. Deformations of Symplectic Forms 
The Fredholm property of 7r allows us to apply an infinite dimensional version 
of Sard's theorem [Sm]. 
Let jo andjl be regular values of 7r (i.e 7r* is surjective for all x E 
7r-1(jk), k = 0,1). So 7r-1(jo) and 7r-1(jl) are smooth submanifolds. Then for 
a generic path 'Y joining jo to jl, 7r- 1 (,,() is a smooth submanifold of dimension 
Index (7r) + 1 and 87r-1(,,() = 7r-1(jo) U 7r-1(jl) (see Figure 11). The crucial 
role is played by the compactness properties of 7r-1 (,,(). 
x 
Figure 11 
First of all, notice that 7r- 1 ("() cannot be compact itself since it admits 
the action of the non-compact group P8L(2, q. Here P8L(2, q is the group 
of conformal transformations of (82 , i) and it acts as follows. If h : 8 2 ~ 8 2 is 
a conformal transformation and (j,jo) E 7r-1(jo) then we also have (joh,jo) E 
7r-1(jo). 
Exercise. Show that this action is free (use that A is primitive). 
Gromov's compactness theorem. Either the moduli space 7r- 1(,,()/ P8L(2, q 
is compact or there exists a family (ik,jk) E 7r-1 (,,() such that jk ~ joo and 
ik "converges" to a joo-holomorphic cusp curve in the class A. 
We do not specify the convergence here. What is important to us is that 
if 7r- 1(,,()/P8L(2,q is not compact, then there exists a j-holomorphic cusp 
curve in the class A for some j E .J. A cusp curve is defined as follows. Let 
A = Al + ... + Ad for d > 1 be a decomposition of A such that Ak f 0 for all 
k and let cPk : 8 2 ~ P be j-holomophic curves in the classes A k , k = 1, ... , d. 
We say that these data define a cusp curve in the class A. The union U cPk(Ak ) 
is called its image and is usually assumed to be connected. 

10.5. Persistence of exceptional spheres 
81 
Imagine now the following situation. 
• The set .1' of those j E .1, which have cusp curves in the class A, has 
co dimension at least 2 in .1 . 
• jo E .1 \.1' is a regular value of 7r and 7r-1 (jo)/ PSL(2, q (which is thus 
a compact manifold without boundary) is not cobordant to zero (i.e. it 
does not bound a compact manifold). 
For instance, a point is not cobordant to zero, since it does not bound a 
compact manifold. 
Then for every regular value j1 E .1 \ .1' the set 7r-1(j1)/ PSL(2, q is 
not empty. Indeed, if it were empty, and we joined jo to j1 by a generic path 
'Y E .1 \ .1', we would have that 
8(7r-1 ("()/ PSL(2, q) = 7r- 1(jo)/ PSL(2, q. 
This contradicts the fact that 7r-1(jo)/PSL(2,q is not cobordant to zero, see 
Figure 12 which illustrates the contradiction. 
Figure 12 
This reflects the persistence principle, which we already encountered in 
the case of pseudo-holomorphic discs in 4.2. Either solutions of the a-equation 
persist or bubbling off takes place. 
10.5 Persistence of exceptional spheres 
Here we sketch the proof of Theorem 10.1.A. Let (p4,w) be a symplectic 
manifold and let ~ c P be an exceptional sphere with A = 
[~l. Let Wt, t E [0,1] 
be a deformation of the symplectic form W = Woo 

82 
Chapter 10. Deformations of Symplectic Forms 
Step 1. Choose an w-compatible almost complex structure jo such that L; is 
jo-holomorphic and extend jo to a one-parameter family jt such that jt is 
w,-compatible (cf. 10.2.C above). 
Step 2. The theory described in the previous section holds without changes 
for the set of j's which are compatible with symplectic structures in a given 
deformation class. So 
Index 7r = 2(CI(A) + n) = 2(1 + 2) = 6. 
However, dim )RPSL(2,q = 6 so dim (7r- I (jo)/PSL(2,Q) = 0 provided jo 
is regular. 
Step 3. In dimension 4 we have the following phenomenon. Two different germs 
of j-holomorphic curves always intersect with positive index at a common 
point. This fact is well known for integrable j's. In the non-integrable case this 
is a simple linear algebra statement provided the intersection is transversal. 
However the proof requires a delicate local analysis for non-transversal inter-
sections. As a corollary, there is a unique jo-holomorphic curve in A. Since if 
there were another one, say L;', then ([L;], [L;'J) = ([L;], [L;J) = -1 contradicting 
that ([L;], [L;'J) :::: O. We conclude that 7r- I (jo)/ PSL(2, Q consists of exactly 
one point. 
Step 4. Choose jo and jt to be regular. We claim that generically no cusp 
curves appear. Indeed, set A = Al + ... + Ad, d> 1 and 
Thus at least one of the Chern classes on the right-hand side is non-positive. 
Assume without loss of generality, that CI (AI) ::::; 0 and that Al is represented 
by a js-holomorphic curve for some s E [0,1]. Denote by 7rAl the projection in 
the class AI. We see that 7rA.;b)/PSL(2,Q is non-empty. On the other hand, 
which is impossible. Thus generically no bubbling off happens (this reflects the 
fact that codim J' :::: 2). Hence A is represented by a jl-holomorphic curve 
and therefore (see 1O.2.E) ([WI], [AJ) > O.

Chapter 11 
An Application to Ergodic Theory 
In the present chapter we discuss an asymptotic geometric invariant associ-
ated to the fundamental group of Ham(M, 0) and describe an application to 
classical ergodic theory (see [P9]). 
11.1 
Hamiltonian loops as dynamical objects 
Let (M,O) be a closed symplectic manifold. Given an irrational number a 
and a smooth loop h : 8 1 --t Ham(M, 0), one can define a skew product map 
Th,o: : M x 8 1 --t M X 8 1 by Th,o:(Y, t) = (h(t)y, t + a). Our purpose is to 
relate the geometry and topology of Hamiltonian loops to the dynamics of the 
associated skew products. 1 
The definition above is a particular case of a much more general notion of 
a skew product (see reFS, p. 231]) which has been intensively studied during 
several decades. There are at least two important reasons for the interest in this 
notion. Firstly, it serves as a foundation for mathematical models of random 
dynamics (see [Ki] for a survey). Secondly, it provides non-trivial examples of 
systems with interesting dynamical properties. 
The dynamical property we consider is the strict ergodicity. Recall that a 
homeomorphism T of a compact topological space X is called strictly ergodic if 
it has precisely one invariant Borel probability measure, say m, which in addi-
tion is positive on non-empty open subsets. Strictly ergodic homeomorphisms 
are ergodic, and have a number of additional remarkable features. We mention 
one of them which plays a crucial role below. Namely, given such a T and an 
arbitrary continuous function F on X, the time averages kr,~(/ F(Tix) con-
verge uniformly to the space average Ix Fdm, and in particular converge for 
1 In this chapter we work with free loops and do not assume that h(G) = 1. 

84 
Chapter 11. Ergodic Theory 
all x E X. Note that for general ergodic transformations such a convergence 
takes place only for almost all x. The contrast between "all" and "almost all" 
becomes especially transparent when one notices that there are purely topo-
logical obstructions to the strict ergodicity. For instance, the 2-sphere admits 
no strictly ergodic homeomorphisms. Indeed the Lefschetz theorem implies 
that every homeomorphism of 8 2 has either a fixed point, or a periodic orbit 
of period 2 and we see that the invariant measure which is concentrated on 
such an orbit contradicts the definition of strict ergodicity. In 11.2 below we 
describe a more sophisticated obstruction to the strict ergodicity which comes 
from symplectic topology. 
We say that a loop h : 8 1 ~ Ham(M,O) is strictly ergodic if for some 
0: the corresponding skew product map Th,a is strictly ergodic.2 With this 
language our central question can be formulated as follows. 
Question. Which homotopy classes 8 1 ~ Ham(M,O) can be represented by 
strictly ergodic loops? 
Here is an example where one gets a complete answer to this question. 
Let M* be the blow up of the complex projective plane CP2 at one point. 
Choose a Kahler symplectic structure 0* on M* which integrates to lover 
a general line and to i over the exceptional divisor. In view of 9.2.E above 
one can equivalently think that M* = P(T EB C), where T and C are the 
tautological and the trivial holomorphic line bundles over Cp1 respectively. 
With this language the exceptional divisor is our old friend ~ from 10.3, while 
the general line is homologous to the sum of ~ with the fiber. The periods 
of the symplectic form are chosen in such a way that its cohomology class is 
a multiple of the first Chern class of M (see Definition 11.3.A below). One 
can easily see that (M*,O*) admits an effective Hamiltonian action of the 
unitary group U(2), in other words there exists a monomorphism i : U(2) ~ 
Ham(M*, 0*). The fundamental group of U(2) equals Z. It was proved recently 
by Abreu and McDuff [AM] that the inclusion 7r1(U(2)) ~ 7r1 (Ham(M* , 0*)) 
is an isomorphism, and thus 7r1(Ham(M*,0*)) = Z. As far as I know this is 
the simplest example of a symplectic manifold with 7r1 (Ham) = Z. 
Theorem l1.1.A. The trivial class 0 E 7r1(Ham(M*, 0*)) is the only one which 
can be represented by a strictly ergodic loop. 
The proof of this theorem consists of two parts. First of all, one has to establish 
existence of contractible strictly ergodic loops. This can be done by purely 
ergodic methods in a fairly general situation. We refer the reader to [P9] for 
an extensive discussion and proofs. Secondly, one has to prove that every class 
2Note that each Th,,,, preserves the canonical measure on M x 8 1 induced by the sym-
plectic form. Thus in our setting the strict ergodicity means that this measure is (up to a 
factor) the unique invariant measure. 

11.2. The asymptotic length spectrum 
85 
'Y i= 0 cannot be represented by a strictly ergodic loop. It turns out that the 
obstruction comes from the geometry of Ham(M, 0). We are going to discuss 
this in more details. 
11.2 The asymptotic length spectrum 
Define the asymptotic norm of an element 'Y E 7rl(Ham(M, 0)) by 
where 1/ is the norm introduced in 7.3. This notion is similar to asymptotic 
growth J1- defined in 8.2 above. The limit exists since the sequence 1/(k'Y) is 
subadditive. 
Theorem 1l.2.A. Let'Y E 7rl(Ham(M,O)) be a class represented by a smooth 
strictly ergodic loop. Then the asymptotic norm 1/00 ('Y) vanishes. 
Proof. The proof is based on an asymptotic curve shortening procedure in 
the spirit of 8.3 above. Let h : 8 1 --t Ham(M,O) be a smooth loop of 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms which defines a strictly ergodic skew product 
T(y, t) = (h(t)y, t+a). Let 'Y be the corresponding element in 7rl(Ham(M, 0)). 
Denote by H(x, t) the normalized Hamiltonian function generating the loop 
h(t)-l. Set hk(t) = h(t + ka)-l and set 
fN(t) = ho(t) 0···0 hN-l(t). 
It follows from I.4.D that the loop fN is generated by the normalized Hamil-
tonian function 
FN(y, t) = H(y, t) + H(ho(t)-ly, t + a) + ... 
+H(hN_2(t)-1 0 ···0 hO(t)-ly, t + (N - l)a). 
This expression can be rewritten as follows: 
N-l 
FN(y, t) = L H 0 Tk(y, t). 
k=O 
Since T is strictly ergodic and the function FN has zero mean we conclude 
that 
111

maxFN(y, t) - min FN(y, t) dt --t 0, 
N 
0 yEM 
yEM 
when N --t 00. 

86 
Chapter 11. Ergodic Theory 
But the expression on the left-hand side is exactly -k length{fN(t)}. 
Note now that the loop {fN(t)} represents the element -N"(. Since v(N"() = 
v( -N"() we get that v(N,,()/N tends to zero when N ~ 00. This proves that 
the asymptotic norm of"( vanishes. 
D 
I do not know the precise value of Voo ("() in any example where this 
quantity is strictly positive (for instance, for the blow up of CP2 in 11.1 above). 
The difficulty is the following. In all known examples where Hofer's norm v("() 
can be computed precisely there exists a closed loop h(t) which minimizes 
the length in its homotopy class (that is a minimal closed geodesic). It turns 
out however that every non-constant minimal closed geodesic loses minimality 
after a suitable number of iterations. In other words the loop h(Nt) can be 
shortened provided N is large enough. The proof of this statement is based 
on the following generalization of the shortening procedure described above. 
Let H(y, t) be the normalized Hamiltonian of h(t)-l. Assume without loss of 
generality that h(O) = :0., and that H(y,O) does not vanish identically. Denote 
by r the set of all points of M where the function IH(y, 0)1 attains the maximal 
value. Since M \ r is a non-empty open subset, and the group of Hamiltonian 
diffeomorphisms acts transitively on M, one can choose a sequence 
¢o = :0., ¢1,"" ¢N-1 E Ham(M, 0) 
such that 
r n ¢1(r) n··· n ¢N-1(r) = 0. 
Consider the loop fN(t) = h(t)-l 0 ¢lh(t)-l¢ll 0 ···0 ¢N-1h(t)-1¢r'/_1' We 
claim that it is shorter than the loop h(Nt). Indeed, note that its Hamiltonian 
FN at time t = 0 can be written as follows: 
N-1 
FN(y,O) = L H(¢i1y, 0). 
i=O 
Set 
a(t) = maxFN(y, t) - min FN(y, t) 
yEM 
yEM 
and 
b(t) = N(maxH(y,t) - minH(y,t)). 
yEM 
yEM 
Our choice of the sequence {¢J implies that a(O) < b(O). Since a(t) ~ b(t) for 
all t, we get that I; a(t)dt < 101 b(t)dt, and this proves the claim. We conclude 
that if a non-zero class"( E 1f1 (Ham(M, 0)) is represented by a minimal closed 
geodesic then Voo ("() is strictly less than v("(). 
It would be interesting to investigate further restrictions on the homotopy 
classes of smooth strictly ergodic loops in the group of Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms.

Geometry via algebra 
Let us return to Theorem 1l.l.A. In this section we very briefly sketch the 
proof of the fact that non-contractible loops on Ham( M*, 0*) cannot be strictly 
ergodic. 
Let (M2n,O) be a closed symplectic manifold. Define a mapping 
as follows. Take an element 'Y E 7rl(Ham(M,O)), and consider the associated 
symplectic fibration P( 'Y). Denote by u the first Chern class of the vertical 
tangent bundle to P("(). The fiber of this bundle at a point of P("() is the 
(symplectic) vector space tangent to the fiber through this point. As before, 
we write c for the coupling class. Define the "characteristic number" 
I("()= r cnUu. 
jpcy) 
It is easy to see that I : 7rl (Ham(M, 0)) -; lR is a homomorphism ([P6], 
[LMP2]). 
Definition 11.3.A. A symplectic manifold (M,O) is called monotone if [0] is a 
positive multiple of Cl (T M). 
Theorem 1l.3.B. ([P6J) Let (M, 0) be a closed monotone symplectic manifold. 
Then there exists a positive constant G > 0 such that v("() 2: GII("() I for all 
'Y E 7rl(Ham(M, 0)). 
In other words, the homomorphism I calibrates Hofer's norm on the fun-
damental group. The proof of this theorem is based on the theory described 
in two previous chapters combined with results from [Se]. Recently Seidel ob-
tained a generalization of this inequality to non-monotone symplectic mani-
folds. 
Since I is a homomorphism, the estimate in 1l.3.B extends to the asymp-
totic Hofer's norm: 
The great advantage of the homomorphism I is that it can be relatively 
easily calculated in examples. For instance, one can show that I("() i- 0 where 
'Y is the generator of 7rl(Ham(M*,O*)) = Z. Thus 1l.3.B implies that the 
asymptotic norm of every non-trivial element of 7rl(Ham(M*, 0*)) is strictly 
positive. We conclude from 1l.2.A that such an element cannot be represented 
by a strictly ergodic loop.

Elements of Variational Theory of Geodesics 
We have already seen a number of results concerning length minimizing geo-
desics on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. In the present chapter 
we discuss a different viewpoint on geodesics based on calculus of variations. 
Given a smooth path of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, is it possible to shorten 
it by a small variation with fixed endpoints? This question is motivated by the 
classical theory of geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. Interestingly enough, 
in Hofer's geometry at least under certain non-degeneracy assumptions, one 
can give a rather precise answer with a transparent dynamical meaning [U]. 
12.1 What are geodesics? 
The intuition coming from Riemannian geometry suggests that the geodesics 
should be defined as critical points of the length functional. Let us try to 
formalize this definition. 
Let {ftl, t E [a; b] be a smooth path in Ham(M,O). A variation of {ft} 
is a smooth family of paths {ft",J with t E [a; b] and c E (-co, co) satisfying 
fa,e = fa, 
fb,e = fb 
and 
ft,o = ft 
for all t and c. We always assume that Usupp ft e is compact. Given such a 
t,e 
' 
variation, consider the length of the path {ft,e} as the function of c: 
£(c) = lb IIF(·,t,c)lldt 
= Ib maxF(x,t,c) - minF(x,t,c)dt, 
a 
x 
x 
where F(x, t, c) is the Hamiltonian generating the path {ft,e} for given c. 

90 
Chapter 12. Geodesics 
Tentative Definition 12.1.A. A path {ftl is a geodesic if 
• it has constant speed, that is IIF(·, t)11 does not depend on t; 
• for every smooth variation of {ft} the length function £ (s) has a critical 
point at s = O. 
Here we immediately face a difficulty - even for smooth variations the 
function £(s) need not be smooth! Thus the notion of a critical point should 
be specified. Our first task is to figure out the structure of the length functions 
£( s) associated to variations of the given path. 
Proposition 12.1.B. Every length function £( s) is convex at 0 up to second 
order terms. Namely, there exists a convex function u(s) and numbers 8 > 
0, C > 0 such that 
I£(s) - u(s)1 ~ Cs2 
for all s E (-8,8). 
Note that whatever the definition of the critical point is, it should not 
depend on the second order terms. The only natural candidate for the critical 
point of a convex function is its minimum. Thus we arrive at the following 
notion. 
Definition 12.1.C. The point s = 0 is a critical point for the length function 
£(s) if and only if it is a point of minimum for a convex function u(s) which 
satisfies inequality 12.l.B. 
Exercise 12.1.D. 
• The definition above is correct, that is it does not depend on the partic-
ular choice of a convex function u which satisfies 12.1.B. 
• If £(s) is smooth, Definition 12.1.C coincides with the usual one. 
• If £ attains its local minimum or maximum at 0 then 0 is a critical point 
of £ in the sense of 12.1.C. 
• Conclude from 12.1.B that the germ of the function 1 - lsi at 0 cannot 
arise as the length function of any smooth variation. 
Now we are ready to answer the question posed in the title of this section: 
a path {ft}, t E [a; b] is called a geodesic if it satisfies 12.1.A and 12.1.C. 
It follows from 12.2.A below that the restriction of a geodesic defined on 
[a; b] to any subsegment is again a geodesic. Thus the notion of geodesic extends 
in the obvious way to paths which are defined on arbitrary time intervals. Let 
I c lR be an interval, and let f : I -----> Ham(M, D) be a smooth path. If the 
restriction of f to any segment [a; b] c I is a geodesic the path f itself is 
called a geodesic. We will focus on geodesics {ftl which are defined on the 

12.1. What are geodesics? 
91 
unit interval [0; 1]. Moreover since Hofer's metric is biinvariant we can always 
shift a geodesic and assume that fo = :no 
Let us turn to the proof of 12.l.B. It is convenient to use the lineariza-
tion idea introduced in Chapter 5. Consider the space Fo of all normalized 
Hamiltonians M x [0; 1] ----t ffi. endowed with the norm 
111F1110 = [1 maxF(x,t) - minF(x,t)dt. 
io 
x 
x 
Denote by 'lto c Fo the subset consisting of all Hamiltonians which generate 
a loop {ht} of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms: ho = hI = :no Let us emphasize 
that the functions from Fo and 'lto are not assumed to be periodic in time, in 
the contrast with the setting of Chapter 5. Denote by V the set of all smooth 
families H(x, t, E) of functions from 'lto with H(x, t, 0) == O. 
Proposition 12.1.E. Let {It} be a smooth path of Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms with t E [0; 1] and fo = 11. The set of length functions £(E) associated 
with the variations of {It} consists of all functions of the form 
IIIF - H(E)lllo, 
where H E V. 
Proposition 12.l.B is an immediate consequence of this formula. Indeed, 
set U(E) = IIIF - EH'(O)lllo. Clearly U is convex and coincides with £ up to the 
second order terms. 
Proof of 12.1.E. Every variation of the path ft can be written in the form 
!t,e = hi,; 0 ft, where ht,e is a smooth family of loops with ht,o = :no The 
Hamiltonian H(X,t,E) of {ht,e} belongs to V. Further, 
F(x, t, E) = -H(ht,ex, t, E) + F(ht,ex, t), 
thus 
£(E) = IIIF - H(E)lllo.

Solve the following exercises using 12.l.E. 
Exercise 12.1.F. Assume that for every t the function F(x, t) has a unique 
point of maximum and minimum respectively, and moreover these points are 
non-degenerate in the sense of Morse theory. Then for every variation of {It} 
the length function £(E) is smooth. Hint: Use the implicit function theorem. 
Exercise 12.1.G. Assume that the maximum set of F has non-empty inte-
rior. Construct a variation such that the corresponding length function is not 
smooth at O.

Description of geodesics 
We say that a function F E Fo has fixed extrema if there exist two points 
x_, x+ E M such that F(x_, t) = minx F(x, t) and F(x+, t) = maxx F(x, t) 
for all t E [0; 1], and moreover the function F(x+, t)-F(x_, t) does not depend 
on t. The crucial point here is that the extremal points x_ and x+ of F(·, t) 
are time-independent. 
Theorem 12.2.A. A path {td is a geodesic if and only if the corresponding 
Hamiltonian function F E Fo has fixed extrema. 
In particular, every autonomous Hamiltonian flow is a geodesic. Hamil-
tonian functions with fixed extrema were introduced in [BPI] where they were 
called quasi-autonomous. Theorem 12.2.A above is essentially due to [LM2] 
(though the definition of a geodesic is given there in a slightly different way). 
In order to prove Theorem 12.2.A we have to investigate in more details 
the structure of variations. Denote by VI the tangent space to Jio at 0: 
Proposition 12.2.B. The space VI consists of all functions G E Fo which satisfy 
11 G(x, t)dt = 0 
for all x E M. 
The proof of the proposition is absolutely analogous to 5.2.D and 6.l.C 
above where the case of time-periodic variations was settled. 
Proof of Theorem 12.2.A. Let F E Fo be a function such that IIF(·, t)11 does 
not depend on t. For a family H(c) from V put G = H'(O) E VI. Define the 
functions f(c) = IIIF - H(c)lllo and v(c) = IIIF - cGlllo. In view of 12.l.E the 
Hamiltonian F generates a geodesic if and only if f( c) has a critical point in 
the sense of 12.l.C at c = 0 for every HE V. Since f(c) and v(c) coincide up to 
the second order terms, and v(c) is convex, this is equivalent to the fact that 
v(c) has a point of minimum at c = 0 for every G E VI. Therefore in order 
to prove Theorem 12.2.A it suffices to verify that the following conditions are 
equivalent: 
(i) F has fixed extrema; 
(ii) IIIF - cGlllo ~ 1IIFIlio for all G E VI, c E R 

12.3. Stability and conjugate points 
93 
Assume that (i) holds. Set u = F - cG for G E VI. Then Proposition 
12.2.B implies that 
Illullla 2: 11 u(x+, t) - u(x_, t)dt = IIWllla, 
and hence we get (ii). 
Assume now that (ii) holds. Take 
G(x, t) = F(x, t) - 11 F(x, t)dt. 
The inequality (ii) yields

12.3 
Stability and conjugate points 
A geodesic is called stable if for every variation the length function £(c) attains 
its minimal value at O. In other words, stable geodesics cannot be shortened 
by small variations with fixed end points. The problem of characterization of 
stable geodesics in full generality remains open. 1 Below we present a solution 
for a special class of non-degenerate geodesics. By definition, a geodesic is non-
degenerate if for every t the corresponding Hamiltonian function has a unique 
point of maximum and minimum respectively, and moreover these points are 
non-degenerate in the sense of Morse theory. For instance, every autonomous 
path with unique non-degenerate maximum and minimum is a non-degenerate 
geodesic. Recall that for every variation of a non-degenerate geodesic the length 
function £(c) is smooth (see 12.l.F). The theory developed in this and the next 
two sections is due to Ustilovsky [U] (see also [LM2]). 
Let {It}, t E [0; 1], fa = :ll be a non-degenerate geodesic generated by a 
Hamiltonian F E Fa. Denote by x_ and x+ the time-independent points of 
minimum and maximum of F(·, t) respectively. Note that x± are fixed points 
of {ttl in this case. Consider the linearized flows ft* on Tx+M and Tx_M. We 
say that such a flow has a non-trivial T-periodic orbit with T # 0 if h*~ = ~ 
for some tangent vector ~ # O. 
1 I believe that it can be solved by existing methods of non-smooth analysis. Note also that 
the first statement of Theorem 12.3.A below which provides a sufficient condition for stability 
holds true for all geodesics, see [LM3]. The proof involves theory of pseudo-holomorphic 
curves.

Chapter 12. Geodesics 
Theorem 12.3.A. aU}) 
• Assume that the linearized flows have no non-trivial T -periodic orbits 
with T E (0,1]. Then {ft} is stable . 
• Assume that {ftl is stable. Then the linearized flows have no non-trivial 
periodic orbits with T E (0,1). 
This result can be interpreted as a description of conjugate points along 
geodesics of Hofer's metric. Namely, conjugate points correspond to non-trivial 
closed orbits of the linearized flow at x±. Before the conjugate point the 
geodesic is stable and after the conjugate point it loses its stability (that is it 
can be shortened by a small variation). We refer to [U] for further informa-
tion. The proof of 12.3.A is presented in 12.5 below. It is based on the second 
variation formula which we are going do describe in the next section. 
Exercise 12.3.B. Conclude from 12.3.A that a sufficiently short segment of a 
non-degenerate geodesic is stable. 
12.4 The second variation formula 
Let {ft} be a non-degenerate geodesic generated by the Hamiltonian F(x, t) 
with maximum/minimum points x±. Denote by C±(t) the operator of the 
linearized equation at x± i.e. 
Consider the spaces 
V± = {smooth maps v: [0,1] ----+ Tx±M I v(o) = v(l) = O}. 
Given a variation {ft,c} of {ftl, define the elements v± E V± by 
v± = dd I ft,cx±. 
c c=o 
It will be convenient to consider the maximum and the minimum part of 
the length function associated to the variation separately. Set 
£+(c) = t maxF(x, t, c)dt, 
Jo 
x 
and 
£_(c) = fl minF(x, t,c)dt. 
Jo 
x 
Clearly £(c) = £+(c) - £_(c).

Example (Isoperimetric inequality). Consider the standard symplectic plane 
]R2(p, q) endowed with the symplectic form w = dp 1\ dq. Let v : [0,1] -+ ]R2 
be a smooth curve with v(O) = v(l) = O. Recall the following notions from 
Euclidean geometry:

where v(t) = (p(t), q(t)). The isoperimetric inequality reads

Going back to our symplectic setting, we assume that the Hamiltonian near 
x _ is given by F (x) = 7r A (p2 + q2) with A > O. So we get the Hamiltonian 
system 
{ 
p = -27rAq 
rj = 27rAP 
Setting z = p + iq we obtain the linear equation i = 27r Aiz. In this case 
C_(t) = 27rAi and C=l(t) = -2;>' and, recalling that w(~,i~) = 1~12, we get

Equation i = 27rAiz has the solution z(t) = e211"Aitz(0) for t E [0,1] and thus it 
has no orbits of period 1 for A < 1. Combining Theorems 12.3.A and 12.4.A 
we get that Q_(v) sO for all plane curves v with v(O) = v(l) = O. Therefore 
47r A area (v) S energy (v)

For the proof of 12.4.A we need the following auxiliary statement. 
Lemma 12.4.B. Let {Jt,e} be a variation of the path {Jd, and let F(x, t,c) be 
the corresponding Hamiltonian function. Then 
taF 
Jo as (it,e X , t, c)dt = O. 
Proof· 
1) The formula above is valid for any variation of the constant loop, that is 
when ft = :n for all t. The proof is analogous to the proof of 6.1.C above. 
2) Consider now the general case. Write ft,e = ft 0 ht,e, where ht,e is a 
variation of the constant loop. Denote by H(x, t, c) the Hamiltonian of 
{ht,e}. Then F(x,t,c) = F(x,t) +H(it-1x,t,c), and hence 
Therefore 
aF 
aH 
as (it,ex,t,c) = 8c (ht,ex,t,c). 
The required statement follows now from step 1. 
o 
Proof of 12·4·A. We will calculate the second derivative of C+(c). The function 
£_ (c) is treated analogously. We work in the standard symplectic coordinates 
x = (p, q) near x+ and write ~.ry for the Euclidean scalar product. Let i denote 
the complex structure (p, q) 1--+ (-q,p). In this terminology n(~, iry) = ~. ry and 
the Hamiltonian system reads 
Thus 

12.4. The second variation formula 
To simplify the formulae later on, we will introduce the following notation: 
{J2F 
a = 8x& (x+, t, 0) 
b = 8;e+ (t, 0) 
82F 
c= &2 (x+,t,O) 
82F 
K = 8x2 (x+, t). 
97 
The implicit function theorem insures that F(·, t, e) has the unique point 
of maximum x+(t, e) which depends smoothly on t and e. Since 
we get that 
Since X+(t,e) is a critical point of F(·,t,e) this expression simplifies to 
Differentiating again with respect to e and setting e = 0 we get

Kb+a = O. 
The non-degeneracy condition guarantees that we can invert K and thus

In view of Lemma 12.4.B

12.5 Analysis of the second variation formula 
Proposition 12.5.A. For all a E V+ and for all b E V_ there exists a variation 
{ft,e} of {fd such that v+ = a and v_ = b. 
Proof. Take a function G E Fo such that 
11 G(x, t)dt = 0 
for all x E M (that is G E VI in the notation of 12.2). This choice will be 
specified later on. Define the variation {ht,e} of the constant loop ht,o = n 
as follows: ht,e is the time-IS-map of the Hamiltonian J~ G(x, s)ds. Consider a 
variation ft,e = ftht,e of {fd. We have 
v+(t) = dd I 
ft,ex+ 
IS e=O 
= dd I 
ftht,ex+ 
IS e=O 
= fh dd I ht,ex+. 
IS e=O 
Our explicit construction of {ht,e} yields 
Set 
d -1 
c(t) = d/t* a(t). 
Choose now G E VI such that in the standard symplectic coordinates near x+ 
G(x, t) = O(x - x+, c(t)). 
Since a(O) = a(l) = 0 by definition of V+ this condition is compatible with 
the fact that G E VI. The explicit expression for G yields 
d -1 
sgrad G(x+, t) = c(t) = d/t* a(t). 
Integrating this equality and taking into account that a(O) = 0 we get that 
1t sgrad G(x+, s)ds = ft-:la(t). 
This implies that v+(t) = a(t). The same argument works for x_. Since x+ and 
x_ are disjoint, the variations we constructed do not interfere. This completes 
the proof.

Chapter 12. Geodesics 
Proof of Theorem 12.3.A. In view of 12.4.A and 12.5.A we come to the con-
clusion that Ud is stable if and only if both functionals Q+ and -Q_ are 
non-negative. Classical calculus of variations provides us with precise condi-
tions when this happens. In what follows we will focus on Q+. The same 
arguments work for Q _. 
Consider the Lagrangian £(iJ, v) = -O(o.:;liJ, iJ) - O(iJ, v). Let us inves-
tigate the critical points of the functional 
101 £(iJ(t), v(t))dt 
on V+. 
First of all, we claim that £ satisfies the Legendre condition, that is 
~:f is positive definite. Indeed, £( iJ, v) = -iC+1 iJ . iJ - iiJ . v and therefore 
8 2 ,C

Since 
and so 
The point x+ is a non-degenerate maximum of F. Thus the matrix ~:f. (x+) 
is negative definite and so is (~:f. (x+) ) -1. We deduce that ~:f is positive 
definite. The claim follows. 
Since £ is quadratic with respect to v, the constant path va(t) == 0 is an 
extremal. For quadratic functionals satisfying the Legendre condition, classical 
calculus of variations tells us the following. If Va is the minimum then for 
all T E [0,1) the Euler-Lagrange equation (which coincides with the Jacobi 
equation) has no non-trivial solutions with v(O) = v(T) = O. Vice versa, if 
there are no such solutions for T E [0, 1] then Va is the minimum. It remains 
to relate the Euler-Lagrange equation to periodic orbits of the linearized flow 
ft* on Tx+M. The Euler-Lagrange equation reads

But this means precisely that w is a T-periodic orbit of the linearized flow.

12.6 
Length minimizing geodesics 
Let I c lR be an interval. Consider a geodesic {ttl, tEl such that all its 
tangent vectors have unit speed: 
for all tEl. Such a geodesic is called locally strictly minimal (cf. 8.2 above) if 
for every tEl there exists a neighbourhood U of t in I such that 
for all a,b E U. 
Every geodesic on a Riemannian manifold is locally strictly minimal. This 
is essentially due to the fact that the exponential map of the Levi-Civita con-
nection is a diffeomorphism on a neighbourhood of zero. There is no analogue 
of such a fact in Hofer's geometry. Still various examples serve as a motivation 
for the following conjecture. 
Conjecture 12.6.A. Every geodesic of Hofer's metric is locally strictly minimal. 
This was proved first for the standard symplectic ]R2n in [BPI]. Later this con-
jecture was confirmed in [LM2] for some other symplectic manifolds including 
cotangent bundles, closed oriented surfaces and CP2. 
It is useful to relax the notion of local strict minimality in the following 
way. We say that a geodesic {it}, tEl is locally minimal if for every tEl there 
exists a neighbourhood U of t in I such that for every a, b E U with a < b the 
geodesic segment {ttl, t E [a, b] minimizes the length in the homotopy class 
of paths with fixed end points. 
Conjecture 12.6.B. Every geodesic of Hofer's metric is locally minimal. 
In finite-dimensional Riemannian geometry the local minimality yields the lo-
cal strict minimality. In Hofer's geometry this is true under the following addi-
tional assumption. Denote by S c [0; +00) the length spectrum of Ham(M, 0) 
(see 7.3 above). Set a = inf(S \ {O}). As usual the infimum of the empty set is 
assumed to be +00. 

102 
Chapter 12. Geodesics 
Proposition 12.6.C. ({LM2}) Assume that a > o. Then every locally minimal 
geodesic is in fact locally strictly minimal. 
Proof. Let Ut} be a locally minimal geodesic. Assume without loss of generality 
that its Hamiltonian has unit norm at each time moment t. Thus there exists 
E E (0; a/2) with the following property. For every path 0: on Ham(M, 0) which 
joins II with ft: and which is homotopic to Ud, t E [0; E] one has length 0: 2 E. 
It suffices to prove that p(ll, ft:) = E. Assume on the contrary that there exists 
a path (3 which joins II with ft: such that length (3 < E. Write "( for the path 
Ud, t E [0; E]. Consider a loop formed by "( and (3. Its length is strictly 
less than a. Hence, by the definition of a, this loop can be homotoped to an 
arbitrarily short loop. But this implies that the path "( can be homotoped 
to a path "(' whose length is arbitrarily close to the length of (3. We get a

In particular, if for a manifold (M,O) the quantity a is strictly positive then 
12.6.B implies 12.6.A. The condition a > 0 is hard to verify. It holds for 
Liouville manifolds (see 7.3.B above), in the case when 7l"l(Ham(M, 0)) is finite 
(for instance, for surfaces or CP2 ), and in a few other examples in dimension 
4. No example with a = 0 is known. 
Conjecture 12.6.B is confirmed in [LM2] for an interesting class of sym-
plectic manifolds. Let us describe this class in more details. Assume that M 
is semi-monotone (cf. 11.3.A), that is there exists a constant k 2 0 such that 
cl(A) = k([O],A) for every spherical homology class A E H2(M,Z). Further, 
when M is open, assume in addition that M is "geometrically bounded" at 
infinity. For instance any cotangent bundle T* N endowed with the standard 
symplectic structure is geometrically bounded. For the precise definition see 
[AL]. Then 12.6.B holds. 
Let us turn to a question which we started to discuss in 8.2 above. Given 
a geodesic, what can one say about the length of the time interval on which 
it is minimal? There exists a beautiful approach to this question based on 
the careful study of closed orbits of the corresponding Hamiltonian flow. It 
becomes especially transparent in the case of autonomous geodesics, that is 
one-parameter subgroups of Ham(M, 0). Let Ut} be a one-parameter sub-
group of Ham(M, 0). The standard ODE technique yields that there exists a 
strictly positive number T > 0 with the following property (see [HZ, Section 
5.7]). Every closed orbit of the flow Ut} on the time interval [0; T] is a fixed 
point of the flow. 
Conjecture 12.6.D. Everyone-parameter subgroup is minimal on the interval 
[O;T]. 
This phenomenon was discovered by Hofer in [H2] for the case of ]R2n. It could 
be considered as the global version of the conjugate points criterion 12.3.A 

12.6. Length minimizing geodesics

above.2 For generalizations to non-autonomous flows as well as to other sym-
plectic manifolds we refer to [BPI], [Sil], [LM2], [Sch3] and [MSI]. Conjecture 
12.6.D provides an interesting existence mechanism for non-trivial closed or-
bits of autonomous Hamiltonian flows. Indeed, assume that we know a priori 
that the autonomous flow {It} is not minimal on some time interval. Such an 
information can come for instance from conjugate points, or from shortening 
procedures described in 8.2, 8.3 above. Then 12.6.D guarantees the existence 
of non-trivial closed orbits on that interval. We refer to [LM2] and [P8] for 
further discussion. 
The study of length minimizing properties of geodesics led to the under-
standing of the following surprising feature of Hofer's geometry. 
I2.6.E. The CI-flatness phenomenon, [BPI]. There exists a CI-neighbourhood 
£ of the identity in the group Ham(JR2n) and a C2-neighbourhood C of 0 in its 
Lie algebra A such that (£, p) is isometric to (C, II II). 
Some generalizations can be found in [LM2]. It is instructive to compare the 
CI-flatness phenomenon with Sikorav's theorem 8.2.A which states that ev-
ery one-parameter subgroup of Ham(JR2n) remains a bounded distance of the 
identity. This can be interpreted as a positive curvature type effect which in-
tuitively contradicts the flatness! It is still unclear how to resolve this paradox. 
We refer to [BPl],[HZ] for the proof of the CI-flatness phenomenon (see also 
[P8] for further discussion). 
There are several different approaches to results on local minimality pre-
sented above. All of them are rather complicated. In the next chapter we 
present one of them which as we believe could be developed further in order 
to prove Conjecture 12.6.B in full generality. We will discuss the following 
simplest case only. 
Theorem 12.6.F. Let (M, 0) be a closed symplectic manifold with 7r2(M) = O. 
Then everyone-parameter subgroup of Ham(M, 0) generated by a generic 
time-independent Hamiltonian on M is locally minimal. 
The proof is sketched in 13.4 below. 
2The discovery of conjugate points was in fact motivated by Hofer's result. 

Chapter 13 
A Visit to Floer Homology 
In the present chapter we sketch a proof of Theorem 12.6.F which states that 
everyone-parameter subgroup of Ham(M, 0) generated by a generic Hamilto-
nian function is locally minimal provided 7r2(M) = O. Our approach is based 
on Floer homology. The exposition is nor complete neither 100% rigorous. Its 
purpose is to sketch a very complicated and still developing machinery rather 
than to make a systematic introduction. We follow closely two papers by M. 
Schwarz [Sch2, Sch3]. 
13.1 
N ear the entrance 
Floer homology is one of the most powerful tools of modern symplectic topol-
ogy. Its creation was motivated by the following question: what are invariants 
of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms? Let us describe the plan of the answer. We 
work on a connected closed symplectic manifold (M,O) assuming for simplic-
ity that the manifold is aspherical: 7r2 (M) = O. The role of this assumption 
will be clear in a few moments. Let us introduce some notations. Denote by 
~(M, 0) the universal cover of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms 
with the base point 11.. Write CM for the space of contractible loops 8 1 ~ M. 
Write CHam(M,O) for the group of contractible loops {ht } of Hamiltonian 
diffeomorphisms based at 11. generated by functions from 1t. To simplify the 
notations, we will often omit the dependence on M and 0 and write Ham for 
Ham(M, 0), etc. 
The group C Ham acts naturally on CM by the operators 
Th : z(t) ~ htz(t). 
The starting observation: there exists a natural map ~ 
~ Coo (CM) / CHam. 
Let us describe this map. Fix an element ¢ E ~. Denote by F( ¢) the set of 

106 
Chapter 13. Floer Homology 
all Hamiltonians F E F which generate cp. The group C Ham acts transitively 
on F( cp). This action is defined as follows. Take a loop h E C Ham and a 
Hamiltonian F E F(cp). Write Utl for the Hamiltonian flow of F. Then h(F) 
is defined as the normalized Hamiltonian function which generates the flow 
hi1 0 It. Formula l.4.D implies that 
h(F)(x, t) = -H(htx, t) + F(htx, t). 
Given F E F(cp), define a function AF : CM ----+ IR called the symplectic 
action: 
AF(Z) = fal F(z(t), t)dt -1 0, 
where D is a disc in M bounded by the loop z. Since M is aspherical, the 
definition above does not depend on the choice of D. 
Exercise l3.1.A. Prove that 
for all h E CHam and F E F(cp). Hint: Use that for every contractible loop 
{ ht } E C Ham generated by some H E H the action vanishes identically on 
orbits: AH({htx}) = 0 for all x E M. In fact on aspherical manifolds this 
is true even for non-contractible loops {ht }. This difficult result was proved 
recently by Schwarz [Sch3]. 
-----
This completes the description of the natural map which sends cp E Ham to 
the equivalence class [AF] E COO (CM)j CHam. 
A function up to a diffeomorphism is a very rich object. For instance, in 
finite dimensions, a lot of information can be extracted from its critical points 
and the topology of the level sets. A powerful tool to get such information is 
Morse theory. In our situation, we have to deal with an infinite-dimensional 
manifold -
the loop space CM. The fundamental observation due to Floer is 
that there exists a suitable version of Morse theory which can be extended to 
this infinite-dimensional setting. We describe it in the next sections. Morse-
Floer ~ry gives rise to a quite complicated structure associated canonically 
with Ham. Our main task is to figure out the place of Hofer's norm of cp 
inside this structure. As we will see, it is closely related to values of the action 
functionals at so-called homologically essential critical points. 
We start with a digression to the finite dimensional situation. 1 The fol-
lowing remark will presumably help the reader to develop the right intuition. 
The manifold M can be naturally identified with the subset of CM consisting

13.2. Morse homology in finite dimensions

of constant loops. When the function F E F is time-independent, the restric-
tion of AF to M is simply F. Thus the usual function theory on M "sits inside" 
the theory of the action functionals on 12M. 
13.2 Morse homology in finite dimensions 
Let F be a Morse function on a closed connected N-dimensional manifold M. 
We write Crit F for the set of critical points of F. Denote by i(x) the Morse 
index2 of a critical point x, and by Critm F the set of critical points with Morse 
index m. Denote by C(F) the vector space over Z2 generated by Crit F, and 
by Cm(F) its subspace generated by critical points of index m. 
Take a generic3 Riemannian metric r on M and consider the negative 
gradient flow 
du 
ds (s) = -V'rF(u(s)). 
Pick two points x_,x+ E CritF. 
Fact 13.2.A. The space of orbits u( s) of the gradient flow which satisfy u( s) --+ 
x_ as s --+ -00 and u(s) --+ x+ as s --+ +00 is a smooth manifold of dimension 
i(x_) - i(x+). 
Note that this space carries a natural free JR-action. Indeed, if u(t) is a solution, 
then u(t+const) is a solution as well. Thus when i(x_)-i(x+) = 1 the quotient 
space is a O-dimensional manifold. In fact one can show that it consists of a 
finite number of points. Denote by kr (x _, x+) E Z2 the parity of this number. 
Define a linear operator 
as follows. For every x E Critm(F) put 
Fact 13.2.B. The operator ar is a differential: a; = o. Thus (C(F),ar) is a 
complex. 
Fact 13.2.C. The m-th homology group Hm(C(F),ar) of this complex is iso-
morphic to the homology Hm(M, Z2) of the manifold. 
2This is the number of negative squares in the normal form of d~F. 
3Here and below "generic" should be understood as in the last paragraph of 4.2: generic 
metric is an element of a residual subset in the space of all metrics, etc. 

108 
Chapter 13. Floer Homology 
In particular, though these homology groups depend on additional parameters 
F and r all of them are mutually isomorphic. A remarkable fact is that the 
isomorphisms can be arranged to a canonical family as follows. 
Consider the space of pairs (F, r) where F is a function and r is a Rieman-
nian metric. Choose two generic pairs 0: = (Fa, ra) and /3 = (Fl' rl)' Choose 
a generic path (Fs, rs), 8 E lR such that (Fs, rs) = (Fa, ra) for 8 ::; 0 and 
(Fs, r s) = (H, rl) for 8 ~ 1. Consider the equation 
du 
d8 (8) = -V'r.Fs(U(8)). 
(13.2.D) 
Let x_ E Crit Fa and x+ E Crit Fl be two critical points. As before, 
for generic choices the space of solutions U(8) which satisfy U(8) ----+ x_ as 
8 ----+ -00 and U(8) ----+ x+ as 8 ----+ +00 is a smooth manifold of dimension 
i(x_) - i(x+). Further, when i(x_) = i(x+) there is only a finite number of 
solutions.4 Denote by b( x _, x+) E Z2 the parity of this number. Define a linear 
operator I{3,Q : C*(Fa) ----+ C*(Fl ) by 
Fact 13.2.E. 
I{3,Q(x) = L 
b(x, y)y. 
i(y)=i(x) 
• Every operator I{3,Q is a chain map and defines an isomorphism 
• The operator I~,Q does not depend on the choice of the generic path 
(Fs, rs). 
• I<,:,Q = 11 and !J,{3 0 I~,Q = !J,Q for generic 0:, /3, 'Y. 
We call a family of operators {I<,:,{3} which satisfies the last property a canon-
ical family. 
Definition 13.2.F. Let (C, a) be a complex over Z2 with a given basis B = 
{ el, ... , ek}. An element e E B is called homologically essential if for every 
a-invariant subspace 
K C Span(B \ {e}) 
the induced map 
is not surjective. 
4The crucial difference between equation 13.2.D and the gradient flow is that its solution 
space does not admit an lR+-action when the family (Fs,Ts) depends non-trivially on s. 

13.3. Floer homology 
109 
The following statement plays a crucial role in our future considerations. Let 
F be a generic Morse function. Assume that x+ E M is its unique point of 
absolute maximum. For a generic Riemannian metric r on M consider the 
complex (C (F), ar ) with the basis Crit F. 
Proposition 13.2.G. The point x+ E Crit F is homologically essential. 
Sketch of the proof: Since the function F decreases along the trajectories of 
the negative gradient flow, the space 
Q = Span( Crit F \ {x+} ) 
is ar -invariant. Moreover HN(Q, ar) vanishes, where N = dimM. This reflects 
the fact that the manifold {F < a} is open for a :s; max F and thus carries no 
fundamental class. We conclude that for every a-invariant subspace of Q the 
image of its N-th homology group in HN(C(F),ar ) vanishes. But 
Hence x+ is homologically essential. 
D 
This proposition yields the following important property of the coefficients 
b(x, y) which count (mod 2) solutions of 13.2.D. Let F be a generic Morse 
function with the unique absolute maximum x+. Consider a generic family 
(Fs, r s), s E lR as in 13.2.D such that Fs equals some Morse function Fo for 
all s :s; 0 and Fs == F for all s 2: l. 
Corollary 13.2.H. There exists x E CritFo such that b(x,x+) # O. 
Proof. Consider the operator 
defined by our data. If all b(x,x+) vanish, then the image of I is contained in 
Span(CritF\ {x+}). This is a ar1-invariant subspace. Moreover, its homology 
coincides with H(C(F), arl ) since 1* is an isomorphism. We get a contradiction 
with the fact that x+ is homologically essential. 
D 
13.3 Floer homology 
The theory described in the previous section essentially generalizes to the 
infinite-dimensional situation. We replace the manifold M by its space of con-
tractible loops .eM, and the function space Coo (M) by the space of symplectic 
action functionals AF where F E F. 
. 

110 
Chapter 13. Floer Homology 
Let us start with the description of critical points of AF . Denote by 
P(F) c .eM the set of contractible I-periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian flow 
Ud generated by F. 
Exercise 13.3.A. Prove that the critical points of AF are exactly the elements 
of P(F). Moreover, if the time-I map h is non-degenerate in the sense that 
its graph is transversal to the diagonal in M x M, then every critical point of 
AF is non-degenerate. 
Denote by J the space of all n-compatible almost complex structures on 
M. Choose an element J E Coo (81 , J). Every such J defines a Riemannian 
metric on .eM in the following way. The tangent space to .eM at a loop z E .eM 
consists of vector fields on M along z. Given two such vector fields, say ~(t) 
and ry(t) define their scalar product by 
11 n(~(t), J(t)ry(t))dt. 
Given J E J we write V' J for the gradient with respect to the Riemannian 
metric n(~, Jry) on M. 
Exercise 13.3.B. Prove that the gradient of AF with respect to the Riemannian 
metric on .eM described above is given by 
du 
gradAF(u) = J dt (t) + V' J(t)F(u(t), t). 
Thus in order to define Morse complex of AF one has to investigate the fol-
lowing problem. 
Find a smooth map u : JR(s) x 8 1(t) ---+ M such that 
au 
au 
as (s, t) + J(t) at (s, t) + V' J(t)F(u(s, t), t) = 0 
(13.3.C) 
and u(s, t) ---+ z±(t) as s ---+ ±oo, where z± E P(F). 
Denote by MF,J(Z-, z+) the space of solutions of 13.3.C. Floer estab-
lished that it has a very nice structure which we are going to describe now. 
The crucial point is that 13.3.C is a Fredholm problem. In fact we see that up to 
the O-order terms this is just the familiar Cauchy-Riemann equation. It turns 
out that for generic F and J the space MF,J(z-, z+) is a smooth manifold with 
respect to a natural topology. Further, the dimension d(z-, z+) of this mani-
fold alters neither under homotopies of the Hamiltonian path Ud, t E [0; 1] 
with fixed end points, nor under changes of J. Thus this number depends only 
on the lift of the map Ud to the universal cover of Ham(M, n). 

13.3. Floer homology 
111 
We arrived at one of the most surprising points of the whole theory. No-
tice that finite-dimensional intuition suggests that the number d( L, z+) is 
simply the difference of the Morse indices of Ap at critical points Land z+. 
However it is very easy to see that these indices are infinite. Nevertheless their 
difference makes sense! The general formula for d(L, z+) is quite complicated 
-
it requires the notion of the Conley-Zehnder index which we will not intro-
duce in the book. However the situation simplifies drastically for the case when 
FE F(glo), where {gt} is a given Hamiltonian flow generated by a normalized 
time-independent Morse function G, and c > 0 is small enough. From now on 
we describe Floer homology for Hamiltonians F E F(ge). 
Exercise l3.3.D . 
• Show that for c > 0 small enough every c-periodic orbit of the au-
tonomous flow {gt} is a fixed point of the flow. Thus P(cG) coincides 
with the set Crit G of the critical points of G . 
• Prove that for F E F(g,o) every 1-periodic orbit of the flow {It} is con-
tractible. Moreover, the map 
j : P(F) -7 Crit G, z(t) -7 z(O) 
establishes bijection between 1-periodic orbits of {Id and critical points 
ofG. 
Denote by i(x) the Morse index of a critical point x E Crit G. 
Fact l3.3.E (The dimension formula). For a generic F E F(ge), and for all 
z± E P(F) the following equality holds: 
d(z-, z+) = i(z-(O)) - i(z+(O)). 
Note that the solution space Mp(L, z+) admits a natural R-action by 
shifts u(s, t) -7 u(s+c, t) where c E R The boundary conditions guarantee that 
this action is free. Assume in addition that d( z-, z+) = 1. Then the dimension 
formula yields that the quotient space Mp,J(L, z+)/R is a zero dimensional 
manifold. A version of Gromov's compactness theorem for solutions of 13.3.C 
states that this manifold is compact, hence consists of a finite number of points. 
Denote by kJ(L, z+) E Z2 the parity of this number. 
We proceed further exactly as in the finite-dimensional situation. Recall 
that critical points of Ap are identified with Crit G via the map j, see 13.3.D. 
Set Cm(Ap) = Cm(G) and C(Ap) = C(G). Fix a loop J(t) and define a linear 
operator OJ : C(Ap) -7 C(Ap) as follows. For an element x E Critm G set 
OJ(x) = 

112 
Chapter 13. Floer Homology 
Fact 13.3.F. For generic F and J the operator aJ is a differential: aJ = O. Thus 
(C(AF),aJ) is a chain complex. 
Example 13.3.G. Consider equation I3.3.C for F = EG and for a constant loop 
J(t) == J. Every solution u(s) of the gradient flow equation 
du 
ds (s) = -EV JG(u(s)) 
solves I3.3.C. A fairly involved argument [HS, Lemma 7.1] shows that for E > 0 
small enough these are the only solutions of the equation provided G and J 
are generic. Therefore (C(AF),aJ) coincides with the usual Morse complex of 
the function F! 
The following discussion emphasizes an important and delicate point 
in Floer theory. Let us try to prove the statement above for the case when 
d(z-, z+) = l. We have to show that every solution of equatiOtlI3.3.C is time-
independent. Since G is time-independent, the solution space M,;G,J(z-, z+) 
admits a naturallR x Sl-action u(s, t) -t U(S+Cl' t+C2) where (Cl' C2) E lR x Sl. 
Assume that u(s, t) is a solution which depends non-trivially on t. Then the 
lR x Sl-action is free in a neighbourhood of u, and thus the dimension d(z-, z+) 
is at least 2. This contradiction proves that u cannot depend on t. Unfortu-
nately, such an argument contains a serious gap. Namely, time-independent 
functions form a "very thin" set in F, and thus no general position type ar-
gument can guarantee a priori that the space of solutions M,;G,J(z-, z+) is a 
manifold! We refer to [HS] for a complete proof. 
Let Fo E F(g/5) and Fl E F(g,;) be two generic functions. Consider a 
generic family (Fs, Js), s E lR where Fs E F, Js E coo(Sl,.7) and (Fs, Js) == 
(Fo, Jo) for s :S 0 and (Fs, Js) == (Fl' Jd for s ~ l. Exactly as in the finite 
dimensional situation we shall define a canonical homomorphism 
The following problem is analogous to I3.2.D. 
Find a smooth map u : lR(s) x Sl(t) -t M such that 
au 
au 
as (s, t) + Js(t) at (s, t) + V J.(t)Fs(u(s, t), t) = 0 
(I3.3.H) 
and u(s, t) -t z±(t) as s -t ±oo, where z- E P(Fo) and z+ E P(Ft}. 
The analysis of this equation is quite similar to the one we sketched above. 
In particular, if i(z-) = i(z+) then under certain genericity assumptions the 
space of solutions is zero dimensional and compact. Thus it consists of a finite 
number of points. Denote by b( z-, z+) E Z2 the parity of this number. In 

13.4. An application to geodesics 
113 
contrast to the case of 13.3.C the solution space of 13.3.H is not invariant 
under translations u(s, t) -t u(s + c, t) provided (Fs, Js) depends non-trivially 
on the s-variable. Define now a linear map I as follows. For x E Critm G set 
I(x) = L 
b(j-lx,r1y)y.

In complete analogy with 13.2.E one can show that I induces an isomorphism 
1* on homology which does not depend on the choice of the generic path 
(Fs, Js). Moreover, exactly as in 13.2 the family of maps 1* associated with 
different choices of parameters (F, J) can be arranged into a canonical family. 
In particular, 13.3.G and 13.2.C above imply that for generic F and J 
13.4 An application to geodesics 
Now we have the necessary tools which will enable us to prove Theorem 12.6.F. 
Let G be a normalized Morse function on M with unique absolute maximum 
point x+ and unique absolute minimum point x_. Write {gt} for its Hamilto-
nian flow. Take any Hamiltonian path {It}, t E [0; 1] with fo = n,fI = ge such 
that {Id is homotopic to {get}, t E [0; 1] with fixed end points. Let F E F be 
its normalized Hamiltonian.

(I max F(x, t) 2: c max G, 
io 
x 
(I min F(x, t) :S c min G.

x 
Theorem 12.6.F immediately follows from this proposition. 
For the proof of 13.4.A we start with the following auxiliary statement. 
Consider the loop ht = ft 0 g;/' Note that Ap = Th'AeG in view of 13.l.A. 
Fix a generic time-independent almost complex structure Jo E J on M, and 
consider the loop J(t) = h;l JOhh
. Denote by ro and r Riemannian metrics on 
.eM associated to Jo and J(t) respectively. Then r = Th'ro. Thus with the help 
of Th one can identify the complexes (C(AeG), oJo) and (C(Ap), oJ). Moreover 
this identification preserves the basis Crit G of both complexes pointwise. 
Lemma 13.4.B. The point x+ is homologically essential in (C(Ap),oJ). 
Proof. Indeed, 13.3.G and 13.2.G yield that x+ is homologically essential in 
(C(AeG), oJo). The result immediately follows from the identification above. 0

Proof of 13·4.A. Fix 8 E (0; to). Let a(s), s E R be a non-decreasing function 
such that a(s) == 0 for s :S 0 and a(s) == 1 for s ?: 1. Set 
Fs(x, t) = (1 - a(s))8G(x) + a(s)F(x). 
Choose a generic path Js : 8 1 ---t :J such that Js(t) == Jo for s :S 0 and 
Js(t) == J(t) for s ?: 1. Consider the homomorphism I defined in 13.3.1. Set 
z+(t) = ftx+ E P(F). Using that x+ is homologically essential (see 13.4.B)

Towards the exit 
We start with a short summary of the material presented in this chapter. Let 
(M,O) be an aspherical symplectic manifold. 
13.5.A. To every generic function F E F one associates a vector space C(AF) 
over Z2. This space is endowed with a preferred basis P(F) consisting of all con-
tractible periodic orbits of the corresponding Hamiltonian flow. Also, C(AF ) 
has a Z-grading in terms of the Conley-Zehnder index. We described this grad-
ing explicitly in terms of the Morse index in the simplest case when F belongs 
to F(gE:). 
13.S.B. A generic choice of a loop of compatible almost complex structures 
J E COO(81, J) defines a differential (h : C*(AF) ----7 C*-1 (AF)' The homology 
of the complex (C(AF ),8J ) is isomorphic to H*(M,Z2). 
13.S.C. Given generic (Fo, Jo) and (F1' J1) and a generic path (Fs, Js) interpo-
lating between them, there exists a canonical chain map I : (C (A Fo), 8 Jo) ----7 
(C(AF1 ), 8JJ. The map I induces an isomorphism 1* on homology which does 
not depend on the choice of the path. The isomorphisms 1* form a canonical 
family in the sense of 13.2.E. 
13.S.D. Assume that Fo and F1 generate the same element of ~(M, 0). 
Then Fo = h(F1) for a loop h E .eHam(M,O) (see 13.l.A). Given Jo(t) E 
Coo (81 , :/), set h (t) = hi} Jo (t) hh' Then the map Th : .eM ----7 .eM intro-
duced in 13.1 identifies (C(AFo)' P(Fo), 8Jo ) with (C(AF1 ), P(F1 ), 8h ). This 
identification is much stronger than the one described in 13.5.C - it works on 
the chain level while the I's induce an isomorphism on the homological level 
only.

Chapter 13. Floer Homology 
The structure described in 13.5.A-13.5.D above is the simplest part of 
what is called Floer homology theory associated to a symplectic manifold. The 
next statement relates it to Hofer's norm. 
13.S.E. Assume that for some J E COO (81 ,.1) a contractible periodic orbit 
Z E P(F) is homologically essential in (C(AF ),P(F),8J ). Then 
AF(z)::; r

The proof is absolutely analogous to the proof of 13.4.A presented in 13.4 
above. Further, denote by cp E fum(M,O) the element generated by F. In 
view of 13.5.D the property of an orbit Z E P(F) to be homologically essential 
for some J is an intrinsic property of the fixed point z(O) of cp. The value AF(Z) 
does not depend on the specific choice of F E F( cp). Thus inequality 13.5.E 
provides a tool for estimating the Hofer distance between :n and cp on the uni-
versal cover fum(M, 0). It remains to develop a machinery which enables one 
to decide which orbits are homologically essential. In 13.4.B above we worked 
out the simplest situation when Z corresponds to the absolute maximum of a 
small time-independent Hamiltonian function. In [Sch3] Schwarz used a more 
sophisticated argument which enabled him to prove the local minimality of a 
wide class of geodesics for aspherical symplectic manifolds. In fact, there is an 
important additional piece of data associated canonically to (C(AF ), P(F)), 
namely the canonical real filtration of C(AF). For a E R denote by ca the 
subspace of C(AF) generated by those z E P(F) which satisfy AF(Z) ::; a. 
Since the action functional decreases along the trajectories of its negative gra-
dient flow, this subspace is aJ-invariant. Thus one can speak about the relative 
homology groups H (ca / Cb , 8 J ). It turns out that this homology carries a lot 
of interesting information about cp. Such a filtration was first systematically 
used by Viterbo [V1]. Further results on this filtration were obtained by Oh 
[04] and Schwarz [Sch3]. 
Let me mention that there exist two natural directions of generalizing 
the theory sketched above. The first one is to extend it to symplectic mani-
folds with non-trivial 7T2. For such manifolds the action functionals AF are 
multi-valued functions 12M -t R In fact, their differentials dAF are well de-
fined closed 1-forms on 12M. Floer homology in this situation is designed as 
a generalization of Morse-Novikov homology of closed 1-forms (see [HS]). The 
second direction is to extend cohomological operations (like the cup-product) 
to Floer homology (see [PSS]). 
Let me mention finally that Floer homology is a very complicated struc-
ture associated to fum(M, 0). An interesting task which is still far from being 
fulfilled is to develop an algebraic language suitable for a transparent descrip-
tion of this structure. We refer to [Fu] for first steps in this direction. 

Chapter 14 
Geometry of Non-Hamiltonian 
Diffeomorphisms 
In this chapter we discuss interrelations between the groups Ham(M,O) and 
Sympo(M,O), and explain the role played by non-Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms in Hofer's geometry. 
14.1 The flux homomorphism 
Let (M,O) be a closed symplectic manifold and let SymPo(M, 0) be the iden-
tity component of the group of symplectomorphisms (see 1.4.C). Given a path 
{It} of symplectomorphisms with fo = n, consider a vector field ~t on M 
which generates this path. Since Let 0 = 0 then iet 0 = At is a family of closed 
I-forms. Let us emphasize that these forms are not necessarily exact. Let us 
consider a basic example which we started to discuss in the beginning of the 
book (see 1.4.C). 
Example 14.1.A. Consider the 2-torus (']['2 = R.2 j'l}, dp /\ dq) and the following 
system 
{ p=o 
q=l 
corresponding to the path of symplectomorphisms ft(p, q) = (p, q + t). This 
path is generated by an autonomous family of closed I-forms At = dp. 
The first question we want to investigate is the following one. Take any 
f E Sympo(M, 0) (say given by a precise formula). How do we decide whether 
f is Hamiltonian or not? A powerful tool which will enable us to answer 
this question in the example above is the notion of the flux homomorphism 
introduced by Calabi and studied further by Banyaga [Bll. We will discuss 

118 
Qhapter 14. Non-Hamiltonian Diffeomorphisms 
it in this chapter. Note that in general one cannot conclude that f is not 
Hamiltonian when it is generated by a non-exact 1-form. For instance, in the 
above example II = :n is Hamiltonian. 
Let us introduce the following useful notion. Let {It}, t E [0,1] be a loop 
of symplectomorphisms with fo = II = ll. Let {At} be the family of closed 
1-forms generating this loop. 
Definition. The flux of a loop is given by flux ( {Id) = fol [At]dt E Hl(M, JR.). 
Let us give a more geometric description of the flux. Let C be a 1-cycle 
on M. Define a 2-cycle 8[C] = Uft(C) which is the image of C under the flow 
t 
It. Note that 8 is a linear map from H1(M,Z) to H2(M,Z). 
Exercise. Show that (flux({It}), [C]) = ([O],8[C]) for all [C] E Hl(M,Z). 
In particular, this shows that flux ( {It}) depends only on the homotopy class of 
{fd in 7fl (Sympo(M, 0)), since the right-hand side persists under homotopies. 
Thus we get a homomorphism 
Definition. The image of the flux homomorphism r c HI (M, JR.) is called the 
flux group. 
If 'Y is represented by a Hamiltonian loop then flux ( 'Y) = O. A fundamental 
result due to Banyaga ([B1]) states that the converse is true. That is flux("() = 0 
implies that 'Y can be homotoped to a Hamiltonian loop. 
It will be useful to extend the notion of flux to arbitrary (not necessarily 
closed) smooth paths of symplectomorphisms. Given a path {It} generated by 
a family of closed 1-forms At we put 
Take a symplectomorphism f E SymPo(M, 0) and choose any path {Id with 
fo = II and II = f. Clearly, flux ( {It}) depends on the choice of the path 
connecting II with f, but the difference between the fluxes of any two such 
paths belongs to r. Thus we get a mapping 
We leave it as an exercise to check that ~ is a homomorphism. Banyaga showed 
that ker(~) = Ham(M, 0), thus 
SymPo(M, O)/Ham(M, 0) = Hl(M, JR.)/r. 

14.2. The flux conjecture 
119 
Exercise 14.1.B. Combine this with Theorem 1.5.A above and show that every 
normal subgroup of SymPo(M, 0) has the form Do -I(K) for some subgroup K 
of HI(M, lR)/r. 
Let us calculate the flux group for (1f2,dpl\dq) (see 14.1.A above). Make the 
following identifications: 
We claim that with this language r = 7i}. Indeed, for each 'Y E 7r1(SympO(1f2)) 
we have 
(flux(,,(), a) = ([dp 1\ dq], 8a). 
Here 8 is the functional which takes 'l!} to Z, the value of the class [dp 1\ dq] 
on the generator of H 2 (1f2,Z) equals 1, and a E H I (1f2,Z). Thus flux("() E 
HI (1f2 ,Z) which implies that r c Z2. On the other hand, the fluxes of full 
rotations of the torus are given by 
flux ( (p, q) 1-+ (p, q + t)) = [dp] , 
flux ( (p, q) 1-+ (p + t, q)) = -[dq] , 
and we conclude that Z2 c r. Therefore r = Z2. In particular, we learn that 
fr(p, q) = (p, q + T) is Hamiltonian precisely when T E Z. Indeed, Do(jT) = 
T[dp] mod Z2. 
14.2 
The flux conjecture 
In general, it is not so easy to calculate the flux group. The simple question 
whether r is discrete turns out to be an important one by the following reason. 
Recall (see 1.4.F above) that the flux conjecture I states that Ham(M,O) is 
Coo-closed in SymPo(M, 0). 
Theorem 14.2.A. If r is discrete then the flux conjecture holds. 
Proof. Let (Ph be a sequence of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms Coo-converging 
to ¢ E SymPo(M, 0). Fix a path of symplectomorphisms which joins ¢ with 
the identity. Write >. E HI (M, lR) for its flux. We claim that there exists a 
sequence of paths connecting ¢k to ¢ whose fluxes Ek converge to 0 when k 
goes to +00. Assume the claim. Then (see Figure 13) for each k there exists a 
loop with flux >. + Ek E r. Since r is discrete we conclude that Ek must equal 
IThis is the COO-flux conjecture. Note that it is equivalent to the CI-flux conjecture. 
In contrast to this, the CD-flux conjecture is a much stronger statement (see [LMPl] for 
discussion) .

zero for large enough k. Thus ¢ is Hamiltonian since /:l.(¢) = 0 mod r, so the 
theorem follows from the claim. 
It remains to prove the claim. It suffices to find a sequence of paths 'Yk 
connecting :n with ¢J;1¢ whose fluxes converge to O.

Note that ¢J;1¢ ---t :n when k ---t +00, so graph (¢J;1¢) is close to the 
diagonal L in (M x M,O E9 -0). Now we use the following trick. Recall that 
L is a Lagrangian submanifold in (M x M,O E9 -0). 
Lemma. Let (P, w) be a symplectic manifold, and let L c P be a closed 
Lagrangian submanifold. There exists a neighbourhood U of L in P and an 
embedding f : U ---t T* L with the following properties: 
• f*wo = w, where Wo is the standard symplectic structure on T* L; 
• f(x) = (x,O) for all x E L. 

14.3. Links to "bard" symplectic topology 
121 
This is a version of the Darboux theorem for Lagrangian submanifolds [MS]. 
Let us apply this lemma to the diagonal L C M x M. It allows us to 
identify a tubular neighbourhood of L with a tubular neigbourhood of the 
zero section in T* L. Since T* L ~ T* M, we see that for large k the graph 
of (¢;,l¢) corresponds to a section of T* M that is to a closed I-form ak on 
M. Clearly ak -7 ° 
when k -7 +00. Fix k large enough and consider the 
deformation of Lagrangian submanifolds 
graph (sak) C T* M 
for s E [0,1]. For every s the submanifold graph (sak) is identified with the 
graph of a symplectomorphism of M. Denote this symplectomorphism by 
'Yk(S). Clearly the flux of the path 'Yk(S) equals [ak]. This provides us with 
the required path, and hence completes the proof of the theorem. 
0 
In the proof above the main difficulty of the flux conjecture becomes 
especially transparent. It lies in the fact that for an arbitrary Hamiltonian 
isotopy {It}, the graph of {It} may leave the tubular neighbourhood of L for 
some t. It will come back to this neighbourhood, but the question is whether 
it is then still the graph of an exact I-form. Note also that the converse of the 
above theorem is also true (see [LMPl]). 
Corollary. If [0] E H2(M, Q) then the flux conjecture holds. 
Proof. We can rewrite the assumption as [0] E f.;H2(M, Z) for some k E Z. So 
1 
(flux("(), [C]) = ([0], 8[C]) E kZ 
for every 'Y E 7rl(Sympo(M,O)). Therefore r c i;Hl(M,Z) c Hl(M,JR) and 
we deduce that r is discrete. Now the above theorem implies that the flux 
conjecture holds. 
0 
14.3 Links to "hard" symplectic topology 
Here is a more conceptual proof of the flux conjecture for ']f2. Clearly the C k _ 
closure of Ham(M, 0) in SymPo(M, 0) is a normal subgroup of Sympo(M, 0). 
Hence in view of 14.1.B above it suffices to show that for every 
a E Hl(']f2,JR)jr \ {o} 
there exists f E SymPo(M, 0) with D..(J) = a 
which cannot be represented as a limit of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. With-
out loss of generality take f to be a shift (p, q) ~ (p, q+T), where T rJ. Z. The 
famous Arnold conjecture proved in [CZ] states that every ¢ E Ham(T2) has 

122 
Chapter 14. Non-Hamiltonian Diffeomorphisms 
a fixed point. Thus if (Pk ---t f, this would imply that f has a fixed point too, 
which is a contradiction. This argument is due to M. Herman (1983), and it 
works for 1I'2n as well. Note also, that it proves the CO-flux conjecture. 
One can try to generalize this argument to other symplectic manifolds. 
The idea is to consider instead of the limiting behaviour of fixed points the 
limiting behaviour of Floer homology. In this way, one gets the following result. 
Theorem 14.3.A. ([LMP1j) Assume that the first Chern class C1 (T M) vanishes 
on 7r2(M). Then the flux conjecture holds. 
Here is another application of the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves to 
the flux conjecture, which was found in [LMP2] for 4-dimensional symplectic 
manifolds, and later on proved in [McD2] in full generality. 
Theorem 14.3.B. The rank of the flux group r is finite and satisfies 
rankz r:::; b1(M) = dim H1(M,ffi.). 
As a corollary we get that for symplectic manifolds whose first Betti number 
equals 1, the group r is discrete, and therefore the flux conjecture holds. 
14.4 Isometries in Hofer's geometry 
No natural metric on SymPo(M, 0) is known. However, one can include general 
non-Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms into the framework of Hofer's geometry 
as follows (see [LP]). Observe that the group Symp(M,O) of all symplecto-
morphisms of (M, 0) acts on Ham(M, 0) by isometries. For <I> E Symp(M,O), 
define 
T<jJ: Ham(M,O) ---t Ham(M,0) , f t---+ 
<l>f<l>-l. 
One can easily check that T<jJ is well defined and that it is an isometry with 
respect to Hofer's metric p. 
Definition. An isometry T is bounded if sup p(f, T f) < 00, where the supremum 
is taken over all f E Ham(M, 0). 
If <I> is Hamiltonian, then the isometry T<jJ is bounded. Indeed, the follow-
ing inequality gives us a universal bound independent of f: 
p(f,T<jJf) = p(f,<I>f<l>-l) = p(n,<I>f<l>-lf-1 ):::; 2p(n,<I». 
Define the set BIo C Sympo(M,O) as the set of all <I> E SymPo(M,O) such 
that T<jJ is bounded. As we have seen above Ham(M,O) C BIo. 
Exercise 14.4.A. Prove that BIo is a normal subgroup of SymPo(M, 0). 
The next conjecture suggests a characterization of Hamiltonian diffeomor-
phisms in metric terms. 

14.4. Isometries in Hofer's geometry 
123 
Conjecture. Ham(M, O) = BIo. 
Theorem 14.4.B. ([LP}) The conjecture is true for surfaces of genus 2: 1 and 
their products. 
We will give the idea of the proof for the case when M is the 2-torus ']['2. 
It follows from 14.4.A that in order to prove the theorem it suffices to show 
the following. Given 
there exists a symplectomorphism <jJ E SymPo(']['2) with b..(<jJ) = (a, b) mod 7l} 
such that the corresponding isometry TcjJ is unbounded. Assume without loss 
of generality that a = 0, b E (0; 1) and <jJ(p, q) = (p, q + b). Note that for a 
curve C = {q = O} we have C n <jJ(C) = 0. Let F = F(q) be a normalized 
Hamiltonian on ']['2 whose support lies in a small neigbourhood of C and such 
that Fie == 1. Denote by It the corresponding Hamiltonian flow, and consider 
the flow formed by the commutators 9t = <jJ-IIt- 1<jJit- This flow is generated 
by the Hamiltonian G(q) = F(q) - F(q + b). Since Gle == 1 we get from 7.4.A 
that p(ll, 9t) goes to infinity when t --+ 00. Thus the isometry TcjJ is unbounded. 
The problem of describing all isometries of (Ham(M, 0), p) is open and 
seems to be very difficult even for surfaces. In connection to this let me re-
call the following classical result due to Mazur-Ulam [MU] (1932): every 0-
preserving surjective isometry of a linear normed space is a linear map. It would 
be interesting to prove, or disprove, a non-linear version of this statement: every 
ll-preserving isometry of Ham(M, 0) is a group isomorphism (maybe after com-
position with the involution I 1--* I-I). Assume for a moment that this was in-
deed true. Then Banyaga's theorem 1.5.D would yield that each such isometry 
(up to the abovementioned involution) equals TcjJ, where <jJ : M --+ M is either 
a symplectomorphism, or an anti-symplectomorphism (that is <jJ*0 = -0). 
This would mean that Hofer's geometry determines the symplectic topology.
