We explore methods to generate quantum coherence through unitary evolutions, by introducing and studying
the coherence generating capacity of Hamiltonians. This quantity is deﬁned as the maximum derivative of
coherence that can be achieved by a Hamiltonian. By adopting the relative entropy of coherence as our ﬁgure
of merit, we evaluate the maximal coherence generating capacity with the constraint of a bounded Hilbert-
Schmidt norm for the Hamiltonian. Our investigation yields closed-form expressions for both Hamiltonians and
quantum states that induce the maximal derivative of coherence under these conditions. Speciﬁcally, for qubit
systems, we solve this problem comprehensively for any given Hamiltonian, identifying the quantum states
that lead to the largest coherence derivative induced by the Hamiltonian. Our investigation enables a precise
identiﬁcation of conditions under which quantum coherence is optimally enhanced, oﬀering valuable insights
for the manipulation and control of quantum coherence in quantum systems.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The paradigm of quantum resource theories [1] provides a
structured approach to investigate the characteristics of quan-
tum systems and their utility in quantum technologies. No-
tably, the resource theories of entanglement [2] and coher-
ence [3, 4] stand out as signiﬁcant examples within this frame-
work. The resource theory of entanglement explores the capa-
bilities and constraints of spatially separated agents who oper-
ate within their local quantum laboratories and communicate
via classical channels [2]. On the other hand, the resource the-
ory of coherence delves into the challenges and opportunities
faced by an agent who is limited in the abilities to generate and
preserve quantum coherence [3, 4]. Furthermore, the frame-
work of quantum resource theories has been adeptly applied to
the ﬁeld of quantum thermodynamics [5, 6]. This application
has enabled a deeper understanding of how quantum systems
can be manipulated within the bounds of energy constraints.
Every quantum resource theory is grounded on deﬁning two
basic elements: free states and free operations [1]. Free states
refer to quantum states that can be easily generated within a
setting that is justiﬁed by physical principles. Speciﬁcally,
within the resource theory of coherence, free states are iden-
tiﬁed as incoherent states [7]. These are states which are di-
agonal in a certain reference basis, denoted by |i⟩. The impe-
tus behind exploring this theory is rooted in the phenomenon
of unavoidable decoherence, suggesting that incoherent states
are those that remain unchanged in the presence of decoher-
ence.
On the aspect of free operations, these ideally are quan-
tum manipulations that can be easily executed, based on the
physical considerations on which the resource theory is based.
For instance, in the resource theory of entanglement, the set
of local operations and classical communication embodies a
set of free operations endowed with tangible physical inter-
pretation [8]. Within the context of the resource theory of
coherence, various sets of free operations have been scruti-
nized [7, 9–14]. A common characteristic among these sets is
their inability to generate coherence from incoherent states.
At the heart of any quantum resource theory lies the fun-
damental inquiry into the feasibility of state transformations.
It is customary to consider the scenario where n copies of a
given initial state ρ are at one’s disposal, with the ambition to
transform these into m copies of a desired target state σ. This
process is envisioned to accommodate an error margin that
diminishes as the number of initial state copies, n, increases.
The eﬃciency of this transformation is quantiﬁed by the high-
est feasible ratio of m/n, signifying the transformation rate.
Within the framework of the resource theory of coherence,
the optimal rate at which one quantum state can be trans-
formed into another is precisely determined when focusing on
the set of maximally incoherent operations (MIO). These op-
erations are characterized by their inability to produce coher-
ence from states that are initially incoherent [10]. The maxi-
mal transformation rate in this setting is encapsulated by the
formula [9]:
R(ρ →σ) = Cr(ρ)
Cr(σ),
(1)
where Cr(ρ) represent the relative entropy of coherence for the
initial and target states, respectively. The relative entropy of
coherence for a state ρ is deﬁned as [7]:
Cr(ρ) = min
σ∈I S (ρ||σ) = S (∆[ρ]) −S (ρ),
(2)
with the quantum relative entropy S (ρ||σ) = Tr[ρ log2 ρ] −
Tr[ρ log2 σ], the von Neumann entropy S (ρ) = −Tr[ρ log2 ρ],
and ∆[ρ] = P
i |i⟩⟨i| ρ |i⟩⟨i| representing the operation of com-
plete dephasing in the incoherent basis. A similar quantity
has been studied previously also within the resource theory of
entanglement [15].
The relative entropy of coherence is an important example
of a coherence measure [7]. Essentially, a coherence mea-
sure, represented by C(ρ), quantiﬁes the amount of coherence
in a quantum state ρ. Its fundamental characteristic is that it
is non-increasing under the application of free operations, de-
noted as Λ f, that are permissible within the resource theory
framework, i.e., C(Λ f[ρ]) ≤C(ρ) for any quantum state ρ and
any free operation Λ f. The literature oﬀers a diverse range of
coherence quantiﬁers, each grounded in either physical prin-
ciples or mathematical foundations [7, 10, 14, 16–19].

2
Considering the signiﬁcance of quantum coherence in
quantum information science and quantum technology [3, 4],
it becomes essential to explore and comprehend the most ef-
ﬁcient methodologies for its generation. One strategy to cre-
ate quantum coherence involves employing a static quantum
channel, represented by Λ. This approach can successfully
create coherence from an initially incoherent state, contingent
upon the condition that Λ is not in the set MIO. The pursuit
of identifying and reﬁning optimal methods for the generation
of coherence through static quantum channels has garnered
attention and been subject to detailed examination in various
studies [7, 20–22].
In this article, we focus on the optimal methods to gener-
ate coherence via dynamical evolutions, focusing speciﬁcally
on unitary evolutions Ut = e−itH. Using the relative entropy
of coherence as a ﬁgure of merit, we investigate the maximal
derivative of Cr achievable in this setting, maximized over all
initial states ρ and all Hamiltonians H with bounded Hilbert-
Schmidt norm. This quantity has a clear operational meaning
via Eq. (1), corresponding to the maximal coherence genera-
tion rate achievable via Hamiltonians with bounded Hilbert-
Schmidt norm. We characterize optimal initial states and op-
timal Hamiltonians for any system of dimension d. For qubit
systems, we provide optimal input state for any given Hamil-
tonian.
II.
COHERENCE GENERATING CAPACITY OF
HAMILTONIANS
For a Hamiltonian H, we deﬁne the coherence generating
capacity of H as the maximal increase of coherence achiev-
able via a unitary evolution Ut = e−itH at time t = 0, i.e.,
Cgen(H) = max
ρ
Cr(e−iHtρeiHt)
dt
t=0
.
(3)
Functions of this form have been previously studied in entan-
glement theory, in the context of entanglement generation via
non-local Hamiltonians [23, 24].
The following proposition provides an alternative expres-
sion for the coherence generating capacity.
Proposition 1. For any Hamiltonian H it holds that
Cgen(H) = max
ρ
iTr(H[ρ, log2 ∆(ρ)]).
(4)
Proof. We deﬁne the state ρt = e−iHtρeiHt and ˙ρt = dρt/dt. It
then holds
d
dtS (ρt) = −Tr[˙ρt log2 ρt].
(5)
A proof of this equality is given in the Appendix. For the time
derivative of coherence we obtain
dCr(ρt)
dt
= dS (∆[ρt])
dt
= −Tr
" d
dt∆(ρt)
!
log2 ∆(ρt)
#
= −Tr ∆(˙ρt) log2 ∆(ρt) ,
(6)
where we have used the fact that dephasing commutes with
the time derivative, i.e.,
d
dt∆(ρt) = ∆(˙ρt).
(7)
Using the von Neumann equation ˙ρt = −i[H, ρt] Eq. (6) can
be expressed as
dCr(ρt)
dt
= iTr ∆([H, ρt]) log2 ∆(ρt) .
(8)
As we further show in the Appendix,
Tr ∆(A) log2 ∆(B) = Tr A log2 ∆(B)
(9)
holds true for any Hermitian matrix A and any positive matrix
B. Choosing A = i∆([H, ρt]) and B = ρt we further obtain
dCr(ρt)
dt
= iTr [H, ρt] log2 ∆(ρt) .
(10)
At time t = 0 we further have
dCr(ρt)
dt
t=0
= iTr[[H, ρ] log2 ∆(ρ)],
(11)
where ρ = ρt=0. This expression can be further written as
dCr(ρt)
dt
t=0
= iTr(H[ρ, log2 ∆(ρ)]).
(12)
Performing the maximum over all states ρ completes the
proof.
□
In the following, our goal is to evaluate the maximal coher-
ence generating capacity over all Hamiltonians with the con-
straint ||H||2 ≤1, where ||M||2 =
p
Tr[M†M] is the Hilbert-
Schmidt norm of a matrix M. As we will see, this problem is
closely related to the variance of the surprisal, as investigated
in [25] (a similar technique has been used earlier in [24]). For
a probability distribution p = (p0, . . . , pd−1), the the surprisal
−log2 pi is a quantiﬁer of the surprise to obtain the outcome
i. The variance of the surprisal is given as
f(p) =

(13)
As we will show in the following theorem, the maximal co-
herence generating capacity for a system of dimension d is
closely related to the maximal variance of the surprisal f.
Theorem 2. It holds that
max
||H||2≤1Cgen(H) = max

2 f(p).
(14)
Proof. Deﬁning the Hermitian matrix
M = i[ρ, log2 ∆(ρ)],
(15)

the derivative of the relative entropy of coherence at time zero
can be written as
dCr(ρt)
dt
t=0
= Tr(HM).
(16)
We can now perform the maximization over all Hamiltonians
H with the property ||H||2 ≤1. For this, we use Hölder’s
inequality, arriving at
dCr(ρt)
dt
t=0
= Tr(HM) ≤||H||2||M||2.
(17)
For a given M, this inequality is saturated if H is chosen as
H =
M
||M||2
.
(18)
Maximizing over all Hamiltonians with bounded Hilbert-
Schmidt norm, we obtain
max
||H||2≤1
dCr(ρt)
dt
t=0
= Tr[M2]
||M||2
= ||M||2 =
[ρ, log2 ∆(ρ)]
2 .
(19)
To complete the proof of the theorem, it remains to maxi-
mize
[ρ, log2 ∆(ρ)]
2 over all states ρ. Denoting with ρi j the
elements of ρ, we obtain
[ρ, log2 ∆(ρ)] = ρ log2 ∆(ρ) −log2 ∆(ρ) ρ

With this, we obtain the following:

log2 ρ j j −log2 ρii

(21)
Since ρ is a quantum state, it holds that
ρiiρ j j ≥|ρi j|2,
(22)
which implies the inequality
[ρ, log2 ∆(ρ)]
2
2 ≤

(24)
Note that the right-hand side of Eq. (23) corresponds to 2 f(ρ).
As we prove in the Appendix, f(ρ) can also be written as
f(ρ) =

(25)
Note that this function coincides with the variance of the sur-
prisal function deﬁned in Eq. (13), if we choose pi = ρii.
Consider now a pure state of the form
|ψ⟩=
d−1
X
i=0
√qi |i⟩,
(26)
where the probabilities qi are chosen such that the variance of
the surprisal is maximal. Consider now the density matrix σ =
|ψ⟩⟨ψ|. Due to the arguments presented above, it is clear that σ
maximizes the function f, i.e., f(σ) = maxρ f(ρ). Moreover,
the matrix elements of σ fulﬁll σiiσj j = |σi j|2, which implies
2 f(σ) =

Collecting the arguments presented above, we have

This proves that

(29)
and the proof of the theorem is complete.

An optimal initial state for coherence generation can be

(30)
where γ ∈(0, 1) is chosen such that the probability distri-
bution (γ, 1−γ
d−1, . . ., 1−γ
d−1) maximizes the variance of the sur-
prisal [24, 25]. Following the arguments from the proof of
Theorem 2, an optimal Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (18) with

H =

(|0⟩⟨φ| −|φ⟩⟨0|) .
(32)

We will now focus explicitly on the single-qubit case. In
this case, we will evaluate Cgen(H) for any Hamiltonian H.
In the following, we denote the elements of the density matrix
with ρkl, and similarly Hkl are elements of H. Moreover, ρ01 =
|ρ01|eiα and similarly H01 = |H01|eiβ. Using Eq. (20) we obtain

Our goal now is to maximize this expression over all α, |ρ01|,
ρ00, and ρ11, taking into account that ρ is a density matrix
of a single qubit. Maximizing over α is straightforward, an
optimal choice is α = β −π/2. We thus arrive at
Cgen(H) = max
ρi j 2 |H10| |ρ01| log2
ρ11
ρ00
.
(34)
For any qubit density matrix it holds that |ρ01| ≤√ρ00ρ11 with
equality on pure states. With this we can perform the maxi-
mization over |ρ01|, leading to
Cgen(H) = max
ρi j 2 |H10| √ρ00ρ11 log2
ρ11
ρ00
.
(35)
This also means that an optimal state can be chosen to be pure.
In the last step we recall that ρ11 = 1 −ρ00, such that
Cgen(H) = max
ρ00 2 |H10|
p
ρ00(1 −ρ00) log2
1 −ρ00
ρ00
.
(36)
This maximization can be performed numerically, leading to
ρ00 ≈0.083.
We note that analogous results have been previously re-
ported in entanglement theory. In particular, optimal entan-
glement generation for two-qubit Hamiltonians has been con-
sidered in [23], and optimal states for entanglement genera-
tion without ancillas have been derived. Optimal entangle-
ment generation with Hamiltonians of bounded operator norm
have been investigated in [24].

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, our investigation oﬀers an in-depth explo-
ration of the coherence generating capacity inherent to Hamil-
tonians, showcasing a methodology that enables the assess-
ment of the maximum coherence derivative achievable in
quantum systems of any dimension, governed by Hamiltoni-
ans with bounded Hilbert-Schmidt norms. Speciﬁcally, for
qubit systems, we have achieved a comprehensive resolution
of this problem for any Hamiltonian, identifying states that
maximize the rate of change in the relative entropy of coher-
ence.
This inquiry opens the door to several compelling questions
for future research. A primary area of interest is the extent of
coherence enhancement attainable through speciﬁc Hamilto-
nians in systems of dimensions greater than those of qubits.
Although our approach provides a novel way to frame this
question, the feasibility of solving this maximization prob-
lem analytically, or possibly through semideﬁnite program-
ming, remains to be determined. Additionally, the potential
applicability of our techniques to other quantum resource the-
ories, especially the resource theory of entanglement, poses
an intriguing prospect. Considering the parallels between the
resource theories of coherence and entanglement, there is a
promising possibility that our strategies could uncover opti-
mal methods for increasing entanglement in a system using
certain Hamiltonian classes.
