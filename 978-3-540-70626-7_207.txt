Squeezed States
Martin Bodo Plenio
In this section we will discuss some basic properties of so-called squeezed quantum
states. These states are characterized by the property that they will exhibit ﬂuctua-
tions for some physical observable quantities that are smaller than the ﬂuctuations
when the same quantity is measured on the vacuum state. Such states, often for
optical ﬁelds, have applications in various areas of physics ranging from enhanced
measurement precisions to quantum information processing.
A pure squeezed state [1] may be represented as a  wave function in position
space where it takes the form
⟨x|ψsq⟩= ψsq(x) = [2π(x)2]−1/4exp

Fig. 1 The Wigner functions of the vacuum state which is a speciﬁc example of a coherent state
(left hand side) and of a squeezed state (right hand side) whose variance in one quadrature compo-
nent is suppressed below the vacuum level by a factor of 3 at the expense of increasing the variance
in the other quadrature component by a factor of 3
(x)2 and (p)2 represent the uncertainties in the measurement of the observ-
ables x and p. For particles these may be position and momentum while for light
ﬁelds these are the in-phase and out-of-phase components, also known as position
and momentum quadrature components. The above formulae share great similar-
ity with  coherent states. In fact, coherent states represent the special case when
x = p = √ℏ/2. Thus, for squeezed states, the uncertainty of one quadrature
component, e.g. position x may be reduced at the expense of the other, e.g. mo-
mentum p. Coherent and squeezed states may be visualized neatly employing the
 Wigner distribution, and two examples are shown in Fig. 1. The fact that the vari-
ance, for example in position, is reduced below the vacuum level has applications
in precision measurements as the reduced uncertainty allows for a more precise de-
termination of position. Squeezed states gained considerably more attention when
it was suggested that squeezed light might be used to achieve better sensitivity in
the interferometric detection of gravitational waves [2]. This stimulated the devel-
opment of experimental methods for the generation of squeezed states of light [3].
The generation of squeezed states of light requires non-linear optical effects such as
parametric oscillation and second harmonic generation. As these non-linearities are
often weak this makes the generation of substantial levels of squeezing difﬁcult to
achieve.
Another area in which squeezed states are of increasing relevance is that of
optical quantum communication in the continuous variable regime [4, 5]. Here, a
fundamental aim is the generation of  entanglement in the form of two-mode
squeezed states such that each light mode is accessible to a different possible distant
party. In the Fock state representation these states take the form

Stark Effect
This state exhibits strong correlations as for example a photon number measure-
ment in one mode determines the outcome of a photon number measurement in
the other mode. Two-mode squeezed states form the basic resource for  quan-
tum communication protocols such as quantum state teleportation. Various methods
for the generation of such states exist. A simple method consists of sending two
single mode squeezed states of the type described above onto the two inputs of a
beam-splitter making sure that one squeezed state exhibits squeezing along the x
quadrature while the other exhibits exactly the same degree of squeezing but along
the p quadrature. The output of the beam-splitter will then be a two-mode squeezed
state as in (3).
The distribution of two-mode squeezed states, and therefore entanglement, gen-
erally suffers from noise and the development of methods to combat the effects of
noise and to improve the squeezing and entanglement in such states is an active area
of research today [6,7].
