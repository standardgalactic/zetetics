Vector Model
Klaus Hentschel
The vector model was developed around 1920 to describe the intricate coupling of
angular momentum L ( Spin; Stern–Gerlach experiment) and  spin S to elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds (either inside the atom or to external ﬁelds imposed by
experimenters in  spectroscopy). Both L and S are modeled as vectors in three-
dimensional space; their vectorial sum, the total angular momentum, is J = L + S.
According to space quantization  Stern–Gerlach experiment as ﬁrst postulated
by Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–1951) in 1916, not all possible orientations of these
vectors relative to the electric or magnetic ﬁeld (deﬁning the direction of the z-axis)
are allowed. The projection of the angular momentum L onto the z-axis ought to
be multiples of ℏ. This restriction also leads to similar restrictions of the orientation
of J and explains the symmetric splitting of spectral lines into multiplets in the
normal  Zeeman effect and  Stark effect in the most natural way. For atoms with
more than one electron, various ways of calculating the vectorial sum Jof all the
contributing angular momenta li and spins si = 1/2 are possible. Either all the li
are summed up ﬁrst to one L, and then combined with S = 
isi, or all the li and
si are ﬁrst summed up separately to ji with J = 
iji (as shown in Fig. 1). Because
Fig. 1 Land´e’s vector model: The orbit angular momentum vector L and the atomic core mo-
mentum vector R (later redubbed spin S) add up vectorially to the total momentum vector J. R, L
and J have to be imagined precessing around the external magnetic ﬁeld (whose axis is by con-
vention always drawn vertically upwards). The component of J parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld
determines the magnetic moment m of the atom which can only take quantized values because
of  space quantization. Source: Friedrich Hund, Geschichte der Quantentheorie (Mannheim: BI

of the noncommutativity of  operators, these two procedures are in general not
equivalent with each other. The ﬁrst is called  Russell-Saunders-coupling, valid
for the lighter atoms, the latter  jj-coupling yielding the better approximation for
heavier atoms and for the energetically higher terms.
It turned out that in order to get satisfactory agreement with observable line split-
tings, the length of the vector L actually had to be proportional to the square root
of L(L + 1), with similar expressions for other vectors such as S and J. For
Alfred Land´e (1888–1976), who ﬁrst suggested this in 1919 within the framework
of Bohr’s and Sommerfeld’s semi-classical  Bohr atom model, this procedure was
admittedly fully ad hoc. Problems with this model even triggered a crisis of  quan-
tum theory between ca. 1923 and early 1925. Strange half  quantum numbers were
postulated by Werner Heisenberg (1901–76) and Wolfgang Pauli (1900–58) in early
1925, foreshadowing the concept of spin only to emerge in late 1925. A deeper un-
derstanding of this strange “numerology” in the “Zeeman salad” (both expressions
by representatives of the  Sommerfeld school) had to await the development of
formal quantum mechanics in 1925/26, in which the square of any  observable
A is deﬁned as the two-fold action of an operator ˆA on a state vector, yielding its
eigenvalue ain the ﬁrst step, and a + 1 in the second, thus ˆA2 yields a(a + 1) and
not a2.
