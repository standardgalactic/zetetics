A Decoupling Procedure for Green Functions: 
Test at the Ising Model and Application 
to an Extended Hubbard Model 
By 
D . IHLE a n d B . LORENZ 
A decoupling procedure for the double-time three-particle Green functions is presented. 
The formalism is tested at the spin \ nearest-neighbour interaction Ising model yielding 
more accurate results than Bethe's first approximation. The decoupling procedure is 
applied to the problem of electron-charge ordering on the basis of an extended Hubbard 
model investigated by Bari, the corresponding phase diagram being calculated. 
Es wird ein Entkopplungsverfahren für zweizeitige Dreiteilchen-Greenfunktionen an-
gegeben. Der Formalismus wird am Ising-Modell für Spin \ und Wechselwirkung zwischen 
nächsten Nachbarn geprüft, wobei er genauere Ergebnisse als die erste Näherung des Bethe-
schen Verfahrens liefert. Das Entkopplungsverfahren wird auf das von Bari untersuchte 
Problem der Ladungsordnung der Elektronen auf der Grundlage eines erweiterten Hub-
bard-Modells angewandt, wobei das entsprechende Phasendiagramm berechnet wird. 
1. Introduction 
In order to treat the Coulomb interaction in Fermi systems recently the Ha-
miltonian 
H =

Z 
a, ß 
was investigated frequently, a, ß label the positions and eventually the spins 
of the fermions. 
Uaß are Coulomb integrals, na = c+ cx and 
the fermion 
occupation number and creation operators, respectively. 
Examples of model Hamiltonians which contain terms of the form (1) are 
the S = -i- Ising model, the Hubbard model including interatomic interactions 
(extended Hubbard model) [1 to 3], and models for the Verwey transition in 
magnetite [4], 
Using the equation of motion method for Green functions [5, 6], decoupling 
procedures must be employed. For many problems, such as electron correlations 
in narrow energy bands, one has to calculate the one-particle Green function 
beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation. 
For this purpose the sequence of 
equations of motion has to be decoupled at least at a stage one step further 
than the Hartree-Fock decoupling, i.e. one has to approximate three-particle 
Green functions by Green functions of lower order. In this paper we present 
a decoupling procedure for three-particle Green functions, which is based on the 
general scheme given by Martin and Schwinger [5] (Section 2). This decoupling 
is shown to preserve important symmetries of the corresponding model Hamil-
tonians. In order to test the accuracy of the decoupling we apply it to the three-
dimensional S = 
Ising model and compare our results with those of other 

320 
D . IHLE a n d B . LORENZ 
approximate theories [7 to 12] (Section 3). We find that our approximation 
yields more accurate results than Bethe's first approximation [8]. In Section 4 
we apply the truncation technique to the problem of electron-charge ordering 
on the basis of an extended Hubbard model investigated by Bari [2]. 
2. Decoupling Procedure 
Treating the interaction (1) by means of two-time Green functions the equa-
tions of motion [6] generate a hierarchy of Green functions: 
= <K; c+»m , Gßx = {nß cx\ c+))M , 
Gßß-a = {nß nß> cx\ c+}a, 
(2) 
and so on. Assuming a finite range of interaction in (1) this hierarchy breaks 
off after a finite number of steps because of nß = nß. The relations arising 
between higher-order correlation functions can be treated using certain approx-
imation schemes. For the case of nearest-neighbour interaction such calcula-
tions were performed for the Ising model [13] and for an extended Hubbard 
model [3]. 
However, some substances which have a complicated lattice structure or for 
which second-neighbour interactions are important can hardly be treated in 
such an approximation. Furthermore, many problems are described by Hamil-
tonians composed of (1) and other terms (e.g. band terms) which do not lead 
to a closing of the hierarchy of Green functions. For these reasons there arises 
the motivation to employ decoupling techniques for the higher-order Green 
functions. As the next step beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation we con-
sider the problem of decoupling the three-particle Green functions Gßß>x. As 
starting-point we use the decoupling scheme developed by Martin and Schwinger 
[5]. According to that the higher-order Green functions are replaced by their 
forms at large space separations. We simplify this decoupling neglecting all 
contributions which cannot be written in terms of occupation number operators. 
For example, decoupling Gßpx we neglect terms of the form (cß clT) ([cß cp cg_; c+))w 
or (cj 
cß*y (cß c f ) ((ca; cx}m. 
Then the decoupling does not preserve the full 
permutation symmetry of the Green functions. Accordingly the first approx-
imation step is the Hartree approximation 
Oßa = < V 
G« • 
(3) 
As the second step we get the decoupling 
Gßß'x = C V Gpa + <nß.) Gßx + (Kp? 
- 
2 <nß} (nß.y) Ga, 
(4) 
where 
Kßp 
= 
<n ß rip} . 
For practical calculations on the basis of concrete model Hamiltonians one has 
to take into account consequently the correlations between the w-th nearest 
neighbours and to neglect the correlations between the m-th (m ]> n) nearest 
neighbours. That is, if the sites ß and ß' are m-th nearest neighbours we approx-
imate the correlation function Kßß• by <%> (n^) and get 
Gßß'x = <nß} Gß'x + <nß<> Gßx — <nß~) 
Gx . 
(5) 
This decoupling is also obtained if in Gßß-X we write n = (n) 
+ An where 
An = n — (ri) and neglect the second order in An.

3. Test of the Decoupling at the S = -5- Ising Model 
The spin -1- nearest-neighbour interaction Ising model forms an excellent test 
case for any new approximate method. Therefore we test our decoupling scheme 
at this model which is given by

J is the exchange integral, Sf the z-component of the spin operator (with eigen-
values i 
for the ion at lattice site i, h = 2 m He (m magnetic moment per 
ion, He external magnetic field); (i, j} denotes the set of all nearest-neighbour 
pairs. 
Using the fermion representation [14]

We restrict ourselves to lattices in which none of the z nearest neighbours of 
any site are nearest neighbours to one another (e.g. simple cubic and body-
centered cubic lattices). Taking into account only nearest-neighbour correla-
tions the Green functions Gjfi in (9b) are decoupled according to (5). Correspond-
ing to the translational symmetry of the ferromagnetic (J > 0) and antiferro-
magnetic (J < 0) states we have

We will give particular attention to the critical temperature and the specific 
heat. Therefore we put h = 0. 
Let us first consider the ferromagnetic case 
0). Then we have (n-i) = 
= 
= n. As long-range order parameter we use the reduced spontaneous 
magnetization 
a = 2 ( S f ) = 2 n - 1 
which, according to (11a), has to be determined from the self-consistency equa-
tion 
2b a = (<r + 6) tanh 
{(z — 1) a + b} — (a — b) t a n h ^ { ( s - 1) a - b} , 
(12) 
where b = [z — (z — 1) a2]1'2. For the linear chain (z = 2) this equation has 
only the solution a = 0 expressing the well-known fact that one-dimensional 
systems with finite range of interaction do not exhibit phase transitions for 
non-zero temperatures. 
The short-range order parameter (nearest-neighbour two-spin correlation 
function) 
x = 4 (Szi S P = 1 - 4 (n - <«( n,» 
can be calculated from (11):

For the lattices mentioned above the partition function of the zero-field Ising 
model is symmetric with respect to the transformation J -* — J. 
Consequently 
all zero-field conclusions for the ferromagnet must be equal to those for the cor-
responding antiferromagnet. 
Describing antiferromagnetism we put (n t) = 
= (, n\? when i is on sublattice A and <%} = <wB> when i is on sublattice B 
where <wA) + <WB) = 1. For the reduced spontaneous sublattice magnetiza-
tion a = 2 <WA> — 1) the short-range order parameter r = —4 
S f ) = 
= 1 — 4 <nt n,j'), and the specific heat we get the same expressions as (12) to 
(14). Thus our decoupling procedure preserves the symmetry under considera-
tion. If, for example, we had used the decoupling Gjfi = 2 (n,f) Gji the symmetry 
in ^ J would be preserved only in the paramagnetic phase a = 0. 
We now investigate the behaviour of the order parameters and the specific 
heat in the critical region. According to (12) we get a second-order phase tran-
sition at the critical temperature Tc, where in the vicinity of Tc the spontaneous

The results of the calculations are presented in Fig. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1 the long-

cific heats of the simple cubic and body-centered cubic (z = 8) lattices are 
compared. The curves exhibit a X-point behaviour with a finite discontinuity 
at Tc. As the coordination number z increases the specific heat peak becomes 
smaller and less sharp and the "tail" above Tc becomes a little smaller. All 
our results are in qualitative agreement with those of other approximate theories. 
The numerical values of the critical temperatures and the specific heat limits 
at T,. are compared with the results of other investigations in Table 1. First 
we have given some effective field approximations. The molecular field or 
Bragg-Williams approximation [7] is equivalent to the Hartree decoupling (3) 
in (9 a) and yields the self-consistency equation a = tanh (J z oj4:). 
The Bethe-
Peierls approximation [8] and the Kikuchi approximation [9] are cluster meth-
ods. For lattices with a two-sublattice structure Bethe's first approximation 
(Bethe I) is equivalent to the quasi-chemical approximation [10] and (for Ising 
spin systems) to the constant coupling approximation [11]. The most reliable

information on the Ising model is provided by the extrapolation of exact high-
and low-temperature series expansions of the partition function to the critical 
region [12]. The results of this method are also given in Table 1. 
From the comparison of the critical data we conclude that our approximation 
is more accurate than Bethe's first approximation. However, just as the effective 
field theories it fails near Tc. 
4. Application of the Decoupling to an Extended Hubbard Model 
Recently, Bari [2] has investigated the electron Coulomb and the electron-
lattice interactions in the zero-overlap limit for a single half-filled band. After 
decoupling the electron and lattice systems it is assumed that the effective 
electron-electron interaction

<*>?> a a' 
is short-ranged (nearest-neighbour interactions). The Hamiltonian (18) repre-
sents the atomic limit of an extended Hubbard model [1] and has the form (1). 
Bari has found that the electronic system described by (18) can undergo 
a phase transition from a Mott insulating state (one electron per atom) to 
a charge-ordered insulating state (characterized by a ground state in which 
alternate atomic sites are doubly occupied) as the temperature is lowered. 
Using Green functions Bari employed a decoupling procedure which treats 
intraatomic correlations exactly and interatomic correlations in the Hartree 
approximation. Within this scheme the phase transition can be either of first 
or second order, depending on the ratio Ijz W. 
In this section we treat the interatomic correlations beyond the Hartree 
approximation employing the decoupling procedure described in Section 2. 
We will calculate the phase diagram and compare it with that obtained by Bari. 
Using Green functions of type (2) (a = i, a) the equations of motion are

we assume the system to be spin invariant so that spin indices will be suppressed 
(sites occurring twice in the subscripts have opposite spins). Decoupling (19) 
we take into account consequently the intraatomic and nearest-neighbour cor-
relations and neglect all further neighbour correlations. Thus according to (4)

particle excitations a>n are given by A(co) = (co — coj) (co — co2) (co — co3). ¡x is 
the chemical potential of the electrons. From (21) and (22) we obtain (n A), 
Kaa,

Since the number of electrons is equal to the number of sites (half-filled band),

the Hamiltonian H — ¡i N (N = £ nia) exhibits the electron-hole symmetry.

Consequently the chemical potential determined by the condition (23) where 
(nA) and <wB) are calculated in any approximation has to be equal to (24). 
We have proved that our decoupling procedure fulfils this condition, i.e. preser-
ves the electron-hole symmetry.

In order to describe the charge-ordered state we define the long-range order 
parameter 
m = <wA> — <wB> • 
(25) 
Inserting (22 a) into (25) and taking into account the relations <«A> = T (1 + m) 
and <wB) = -f- (1 — m) equations (25) and (22b) form a system of four coupled 
self-consistency equations for m and the correlation functions Kaa., -KBB, 
B ( = -KBA) as functions of temperature T. This system has to be solved 
numerically for different ratios R = I¡2 z W. 
We now discuss the nature of the solution for m considering sufficiently small 
ratios R. In Fig. 3 the possible solutions denoted by mlt m2, and m3 are plotted 
qualitatively for some values of R. For T > T^(R) there is only the solution 
m, = 0. For T 
TB(R) there can exist as many as three solutions. In order 
to select the one solution which describes the equilibrium state for given values 
of R and T we have to compare the corresponding free energies. 
In the Appendix the self-consistent calculation of the free energy from the 
Green functions is demonstrated. 
It turns out that the free energy of m3 is 
always larger than that of m1 and m2. For R < 0.23 we obtain a second-order 
phase transition (Fig. 3a). For R > 0.23 (Fig. 3b, c) we compare the energies 
of wij and m2 and thus determine the critical temperature Ta at which a first-
order phase transition from the charge-ordered insulator (T 
Tc, m2 has lower 
energy than Wj) to the Mott insulator (T > Tc, m1 has lower energy than m2) 
occurs (for 0.23 < R < 0.50). For R > 0.50 the Mott state m = 0 is most 
stable for all temperatures. 
Fig. 4 is the phase diagram in which the phase 
boundary between the charge ordered state and 
the Mott state is shown (solid curve). The 
dotted line separates the regions of second-order 
and first-order phase transitions. For compari-
son the phase diagram calculated by Bari is also 
shown (dashed curve). According to a rigorous 
ground state analysis by Bari the phase tran-
sition at T = 0 occurs at R = 
as was also 
found by our approximation. For increasing 
values of 2 z Wjl the deviation of our phase 
boundary from that of Bari increases reflec-
ting the fact that the Hartree approximation 
for the interatomic 
interaction W becomes 
uncertain. However, the position of the dotted 
line (R = 0.23) is almost the same as that found 
by Bari.

In order to calculate the free energy from the Green functions we introduce 
formally a dimensionless coupling constant X and get the Hamiltonian 
H(X) - p{X) N = X (H - p N) , 
(Al) 
where H and fi are given by (18) and (24), respectively. For X = 1 the Hamil-
tonian (Al) describes the original problem. The value X = 0 corresponds to 
non-interacting electrons. 
The thermodynamic potential with respect to (Al) is given by 
fl(A) = - i l n T r e - ' l ( ' - ' , * ) .

The correlation functions occurring in (A6) have to be determined from the 
Green functions according to (22h) provided the parameters W and I are sub-
stituted by k W and 1 I, respectively. 
We point out that the calculation of the free energy according to (A5) can 
only be performed if the potential Q(A) is an analytic function of A as mentioned 
above. Considering T < TB and a first-order phase transition this condition is 
not fulfilled because Q(X) has a discontinuity at A = TjTa. 
In this case the 
free energy of the ordered phase must be determined by another method. 
We first calculate the entropy S from the internal energy (Hy using the ther-
modynamic relation T (dS/dT) 
= d(HyjoT. 
Since the ground state entropy

Measurements are reported for optical phonons (fc = 0) by Baman scattering at 300, 
80, and 2 K for Bi, Cd, Mg, and Zn. The linewidths are found to increase, and the frequen-
cies to decrease, as the temperature is raised. The temperature dependent portion of the 
linewidth is attributed to a two-phonon decay process. In addition, the contributions to 
the linewidth from the isotope effect, the electron-phonon interaction, and strains are dis-
cussed. 
Die optischen Phononen (fc = 0) in Bi, Cd, Mg und Zn wurden bei 300, 80 und 2 K mit 
Hilfe der Ramanstreuung untersucht. Die Energie der Phononen erniedrigt sich mit stei-
gender Temperatur, während gleichzeitig die Linienbreite zunimmt. Die Temperaturab-
hängigkeit der Linienbreite läßt sich durch einen Zwei-Phononen-Zerfallsprozeß erklären. 
Die Einflüsse von Isotopie-Effekt und Elektron-Phonon-Wechselwirkung auf die Lebens-
dauer der Phononen werden diskutiert. 
1. Introduction 
The investigation of the electron-phonon interaction has attracted much 
attention since it has been recognized that it is a driving mechanism for super-
conductivity. Perhaps the most direct method to determine this electron-
phonon coupling is from the width of phonons as measured by neutron scattering 
at low temperatures. In simple metals such as K and Al, these widths are 
typically less than a few percent of the phonon energy, and are, therefore, rather 
difficult to determine experimentally. The measurements of phonon linewidths 
in Al at 80 K were partly explained as arising from an electron-phonon inter-
action [1], Linewidth measurements of phonons in K could also be partly 
ascribed to an electron-phonon interaction [2], although the instrumental reso-
lution (5 cm-1) was much larger than the extracted low-temperature linewidth 
(1 to 2 cm-1). Jain and Jain [3] have recently put forth a theory of phonon 
damping from the electron-phonon interaction, and conclude that in simple 
metals a large portion of the damping measured by neutron scattering arises 
from the electron-phonon interaction. Large linewidths of acoustical phonons 
have recently been observed in high-temperature superconductors and have 
successfully been interpreted as arising from electron-phonon coupling [4, 5]. 
In principle, it is also possible to extract information about the electron-
phonon interaction from the linewidth of optical phonons in metals measured 
by Raman scattering. Due to the small penetration depth of light in metals 
(ss 100 A), the scattering cross-section is rather small, so that not very many 
measurements have been reported for Baman scattering. We have, therefore, 
set up a program to investigate linewidths of phonons in metals to see what
