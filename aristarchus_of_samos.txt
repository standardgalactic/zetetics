ARISTARCHUS OF SAMOS
HISTORIANS of mathematics have, as a rule, given too little
attention to Aristarchus of Samos. The reason is no doubt
that he was an astronomer, and therefore it might be supposed
that his work would have no sufficient interest for the mathe-
matician. The Greeks knew better; they called him Aristar-
chus' ' the mathematician \ to distinguish him from the host
of other Aristarchuses; he is also included by Vitruvius
among the few great men who possessed an equally profound
knowledge of all branches of science, geometry, astronomy,
music, &c.
' Men of this type are rare, men such as were, in times past,
Aristarchus of Samos, Philolaus and Archytas of Tarentum,
Apollonius of Perga, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, Archimedes and
Scopinas of Syracuse, who left to posterity many mechanical
and gnomonic appliances which they invented and explained
on mathematical (lit. ' numerical') principles/l
That Aristarchus was a very capable geometer is proved by
his extant work On the sizes and distances of the Sun and
Moon which will be noticed later in this chapter: in the
mechanical line he is credited with the discovery of an im-
proved sun-dial, the so-called cr/ca0?7, which had, not a plane,
but a concave hemispherical surface, with a pointer erected
vertically in the middle throwing shadows and so enabling
the direction and the height of the sun to be read off by means
of lines marked on the surface of the hemisphere. He also
wrote on vision, light and colours. His views on the latter
subjects were no doubt largely influenced by his master, Strato
of Lampsacus; thus Strato held that colours were emanations
from bodies, material molecules, as it were, which imparted to
the. intervening air the same colour as that possessed by the
body, while Aristarchus said that colours are ' shapes or forms

stamping the air with impressions like themselves, as it were',
that' colours in darkness have no colouring', and that ' light
is the colour impinging on a substratum \
Two facts enable us to fix Aristarchus's date approximately.
In 281/280 B.C. he made an observation of the summer
solstice; and a book of his, presently to be mentioned, was
published before the date of Archimedes's Psammites or Sand-
reckoner, a work written before 216 B.C. Aristarchus, there-
fore, probably lived circa 310-230 B.C., that is, he was older
than Archimedes by about 25 years.
To Aristarchus belongs the high honour of having been
the first to formulate the Copernican hypothesis, which was
then abandoned again until it was revived by Copernicus
himself. His claim to the title of ' the ancient Copernicus ' is
still, in my opinion, quite unshaken, notwithstanding the in-
genious and elaborate arguments brought forward by Schia-
parelli to prove that it was Heraclides of Pontus who first
conceived the heliocentric idea. Heraclides is (along with one
Ecphantus, a Pythagorean) credited with having been the first
to hold that the earth revolves about its own axis every 24
hours, and he was the first to discover that Mercury and Venus
revolve, like satellites, about the, sun. But though this proves
that Heraclides came near, if he did not actually reach, the
hypothesis of Tycho Brahe, according to which the earth was
in the centre and the rest of the system, the sun with the
planets revolving round it, revolved round the earth, it does
not suggest that he moved the earth away from the centre.
The contrary is indeed stated by Aetius, who says that ' Hera-
clides and Ecphantus make the earth move, not in the sense of
translation, but by way of turning on an axle, like a wheel,
from west to east, about its own centre'.1 
None of the
champions of Heraclides have been able to meet this positive
statement. But we have conclusive evidence in favour of the
claim of Aristarchus; indeed, ancient testimony is unanimous
on the point. Not only does Plutarch tell us that Cleanthes
held that Aristarchus ought to be indicted for the impiety of
' putting the Hearth of the Universe in motion'2; we have the
best possible testimony in the precise statement of a great

contemporary, Archimedes. 
In the Sand-reckoner Archi-
medes has this passage.
1 You [King Gelon] are aware that "universe" is the name
given by most astronomers to the sphere the centre of which
is the centre of the earth, while its radius is equal to the
straight line between the centre of the sun and the centre of
the earth. This is the common account, as you have heard
from astronomers. But Aristarchus brought out a book con-
sisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a conse-
quence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many
times greater than the " universe " just mentioned. His hypo-
theses are that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved,
that the earth revolves about the sun in the circumference of a
circle, the sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the
sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same centre as the
sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth
to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed
stars as the centre of the sphere bears to its surface.'
(The last statement is a variation of a traditional phrase, for
which there are many parallels (cf. Aristarchus's Hypothesis 2
' that the earth is in the relation of a point and centre to the
sphere in which the moon moves'), and is a method of saying
that the ' universe' is infinitely great in relation not merely to
the size of the sun but even to the orbit of the earth in its
revolution about it; the assumption was necessary to Aris-
tarchus in order that he might not have to take account of
parallax.)
Plutarch, in the passage referred to above, also makes it
clear that Aristarchus followed Heraclides in attributing to
the earth the daity rotation about its axis. The bold hypo-
thesis of Aristarchus found few adherents. 
Seleucus, of
Seleucia on the Tigris, is the only convinced supporter of it of
whom we hear, and it was speedily abandoned altogether,
mainly owing to the great authority of Hipparchus. Nor do
we find any trace of the heliocentric hypothesis in Aris-
tarchus's extant work On the. sizes and distances of the
Sun and Moon. This is presumably because that work was
written before the hypothesis was formulated in the book
referred to by Archimedes. The geometry of the treatise
is, however, unaffected by the difference between the hypo-
theses.

ARISTARCHUS OF SAMOS
Archimedes also says that it was Aristarchus who dis-
covered that the apparent angular diameter of the sun is about
1/720th part of the zodiac circle, that is to say, half a degree.
We do not know how he arrived at this pretty accurate figure:
but, as he is credited with the invention of the aKacprj, he may
have used this instrument for the purpose. But here again
the discovery must apparently have been later than the trea-
tise On sizes and distances, for the value of the subtended
angle is there assumed to be 2° (Hypothesis 6). How Aris-
tarchus came to assume a value so excessive is uncertain. As
the mathematics of his treatise is not dependent on the actual
value taken, 2° may have been assumed merely by way of
illustration; or it may have been a guess at the apparent
diameter made before he had thought of attempting to mea-
sure it. Aristarchus assumed that the angular diameters of
the sun and moon at the centre of the earth are equal.
The method of the treatise depends on the just observation,
which is Aristarchus's third ' hypothesis \ that(when the moon
appears to us halved, the great circle which divides the dark
and the bright portions of the moon is in the direction of our
eye'; the effect of this (since the moon receives its light from
the sun), is that at the time of the dichotomy the centres of
the sun, moon and earth form a triangle right-angled at the
centre of the moon. Two other assumptions were necessary:
first, an estimate of the size of the angle of the latter triangle
at the centre of the earth at the moment of dichotomy : this
Aristarchus assumed (Hypothesis 4) to be ' less than a quad-
rant by one-thirtieth of a quadrant', i.e. 87°, again an inaccu-
rate estimate, the true value being 89° 50y; secondly, an esti-
mate of the breadth of the earth's shadow where the moon
traverses it: this he assumed to be ' the breadth of two
moons' (Hypothesis 5).
The inaccuracy of the assumptions does not, however, detract
from the mathematical interest of the succeeding investigation.
Here we find the logical sequence of propositions and the abso-
lute rigour of demonstration characteristic of Greek geometry;
the only remaining drawback would be the practical difficulty
of determining the exact moment when the moon ' appears to
us halved'. The form and style of the book are thoroughly
classical, as befits the period between Euclid and Archimedes ;

the Greek is even remarkably attractive. The content from
the mathematical point of view is no less interesting, for we
have here the first specimen extant of pure geometry used
with a trigonometrical object, in which respect it is a sort of
forerunner of Archimedes's Measurement of a Circle. Aristar-
chus does not actually evaluate the trigonometrical ratios
on which the ratios of the sizes and distances to be obtained
depend; he finds limits between which they lie, and that by
means of certain propositions which he assumes without proof,
and which therefore must have been generally known to
mathematicians of his day. These propositions are the equi-
valents of the statements that,
(1) if a is what we call the circular measure of an angle
and ex is less than \ n, then the ratio sin OL/OL decreases, and the
ratio tan OL/OL increases, as OL increases from 0 to \ IT ;
(2) if /S be the circular measure of another angle less than
17r, and OL > /?, then
sin OL 
OL tan OL
sm£ < ]3< tan/?'
Aristarchus of course deals, not with actual circular measures,
sines and tangents, but with angles (expressed not in degrees
but as fractions of right angles), arcs of circles and their
chords. Particular results obtained by Aristarchus are the
equivalent of the following:
A >sin3 o>^ 0-, 
[Prop. 7]
^ > s i n l ° > ^ 
[Prop. 11]
1 > cosl° > |f, 
[Prop. 12]
1 >cos 2l°>||. 
[Prop. 13]
The book consists of eighteen propositions. 
Beginning with
six hypotheses to the effect already indicated, Aristarchus
declares that he is now in a position to prove
(1) that the distance of the sun from the earth is greater than
eighteen times, but less than twenty times, the distance of the
moon from the earth;
(2) that the diameter of the sun has the same ratio as afore-
said to the diameter of the moon;
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600583.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press

6 
ARISTARCHUS OF SAMOS
(3) that the diameter of the sun has to the diameter of the
earth a ratio greater than 19:3, but less than 43 :6.
The propositions containing these results are Props. 7, 9
and 15.
Prop. 1 is preliminary, proving that two equal spheres are
comprehended by one cylinder, and two unequal spheres by
one cone with its vertex in the direction of the lesser sphere,
and the cylinder or cone touches the spheres in circles at
right angles to the line of centres. Prop. 2 proves that, if
a sphere be illuminated by another sphere larger than itself,
the illuminated portion is greater than a hemisphere. Prop. 3
shows that the circle in the moon which divides the dark from
the bright portion is least when the cone comprehending the
sun and the moon has its vertex at our eye. The ' dividing
circle', as we shall call it for short, which was in Hypothesis 3
spoken of as a great circle, is proved in Prop. 4 to be, not
a great circle, but a small circle not perceptibly different
from a great circle. The proof is typical and is worth giving
along with that of some connected propositions (11 and 12).
B is the centre of the moon, A that of the earth, CD the
diameter of the ' dividing circle in the moon \ EF the parallel
diameter in the moon. BA meets the circular section of the
moon through A and EF in G, and CD in L. 
GH, GK
are arcs each of which is equal to half the arc CE. By
Hypothesis 6 the angle GAD is ' one-fifteenth of a sign' =2°,
and the angle BAG = 1°.
Now, says Aristarchus,

BG.BA

E C
and (taking the doubles) Z HAK < ^ Z HBK.
But Z HBK — Z EBG = ^ R (where R is a right angle);
therefore 
Z HAK < ?&? R-
But ca magnitude (arcffif) seen under such an angle is
imperceptible to our eye';
therefore, a fortiori, the arcs CE, DF are severally imper-
ceptible to our eye. 
Q. E. D.
An easy deduction from the same figure is Prop. 12, which
shows that the ratio of CD, the diameter of the 'dividing
circle', to EF, the diameter of the moon, is < 1 but > §§.
We have 
Z EBG = Z BAG = 1°;
therefore 
(arc EC) — ^ (arc EG),
and accordingly 
(arc GG) : (arc GE) = 89 : 90.
Doubling the arcs, we have
(arc GGD): (arc EGF) = 89 : 90.
But 
GD:EF> (arc GGD): (arc EGF)
[equivalent to sin a/sin/3 > a//?, where Z.GBD = 2 a,
and 2 /3 = 7r] ;
therefore 
GD.EF [ = cos 1°] > 89 : 90,
while obviously 
CD: i£F < 1.
Prop. 11 finds limits to the ratio EF.BA 
(the ratio of the
diameter of the moon to the distance of its centre from
the centre of the earth); the ratio is < 2 : 45 but > 1: 30.

ARISTARCHUS OF SAMOS
The first part follows from the relation found in Prop. 4,
namely 
BC.BA < 1:45,
for 
EF = 2 BG.
The second part requires the use of the circle drawn with
centre A and radius AC. This circle is that on which the
ends of the diameter of the f dividing circle' move as the moon
moves in a circle about the earth. If r is the radius AC
of this circle, a chord in it equal to r subtends at the centre
A an angle of §JR or 60°; and the arc CD subtends at A
an angle of 2°
But 
(arc subtended by CD): (arc subtended by r)
< CD:r,
or 
2:60 < CD:r;
that is, 
CD: CA > 1: 30.
And, by similar triangles,
CL:CA = CB:BA, or CD:CA = 2CB.BA = FE.BA.
Therefore 
FE.BA > I: 30.
The proposition which is of the greatest interest on the
whole is Prop. 7, to the effect that the distance of the sun
from the varth is greater than 18 times, but less than 20
times, the distance of the moon from the earth. This result
represents a great improvement on all previous attempts to
estimate the relative distances. The first speculation on the
subject was that of Anaximander (circa 611—545 B.C.), who
seems to have made the distances of the sun and moon from
the earth to be in the ratio 3:2. 
Eudoxus, according to
Archimedes, made the diameter of the sun 9 times that of
the moon, and Phidias, Archimedes's father, 12 times; and,
assuming that the angular diameters of the two bodies are
equal, the ratio of their distances would be the same.
Aristarchus's proof is shortly.as follows. A is the centre of
the sun, B that of the earth, and C that of the moon at the
moment of dichotomy, so that the angle ACB is right. 
ABEF
is a square, and AE is a quadrant of the sun's circular orbit.
Join BF, and bisect the angle FBE by BG, so that
LGBE= \R or 22|°

Therefore 
FE.EG > 12 : 5 or 36 :15.
Compounding this with (1) above, we have
FE\EH> 
36:2 or 18:1.
II. To prove 
BA < 20 BG.
Let BH meet the circle AE in D, and draw DK parallel
to EB. Circumscribe a circle about the triangle BKD, and
let the chord BL be equal to the radius (r) of the circle.
Now 
LBLK = LDBE = 
^R,
so that arc BK = -^ (circumference of circle).
Thus 
(arc BK): (arc BL) = £>: I *
= 1:10.
And 
(arc BK): (arc BL) < BK:r
[this is equivalent to a//? < sin a/sin /?, where a < £ < ^TT],
so that 
r < 10 BK,
and 
£Z) < 20 BK.
But 
BD:BK = AB:BC;
therefore 
AB < 20 £C. 
Q. E. D.
The remaining results obtained in the treatise can be
visualized by means of the three figures annexed, which have
reference to the positions of the sun (centre A), the earth
(centre B) and the moon (centre C) during an eclipse. Fig. 1
shows the middle position of the moon relatively to the earth's
shadow which is bounded by the cone comprehending the sun
and the earth. ON is the arc with centre B along which
move the extremities of the diameter of the dividing circle in
the moon. Fig. 3 shows the same position of the moon in the
middle of the shadow, but on a larger scale. Fig. 2 shows
the moon at the moment when it has just entered the shadow;
and, as the breadth of the earth's shadow is that of two moons
(Hypothesis 5), the moon in the position shown touches BN at
if and BL at L, where L is the middle point of the arc ON.
It should be added that, in Fig. 1, ZJFis the diameter of the
circle in which the sun is touched by the double cone with B
as vertex, which comprehends both the sun and the moon,

while Y, Z are the points in which the perpendicular through
A, the centre of the sun, to BA meets the cone enveloping the
sun and the earth.

Hence

ON < 2 (diam. of moon).
But 
(diam. of moon) < ^ (diam. of sun); 
(Prop. 7)
therefore 
ON < § (diam. of sun).
Again 
ON: (diam. of moon) > 88 : 45, from above,
and 
(diam. of moon): (diam. of sun) > 1: 20; 
(Prop. 7)
therefore, ex aequali,
ON: (diam. of sun) > 88 : 900
> 22:225.
(3) Since the same cone comprehends the sun and the moon,
the triangle BUY (Fig. 1) and the triangle BLN (Fig. 2) are
similar, and
LN.LP = UV: (diam. of sun)

< UA.AY.

The arcs OM, ML, LP, PN are all equal; therefore so are

Therefore the triangles LOS, CMR are similar.
Therefore

that is,

Therefore, ex aequali,
XA.AB < 19:16,

AX: XB > 19:3;
therefore (diam. of sun): (diam. of earth) > 19:3.
