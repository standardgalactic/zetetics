The three-dimensional Ising model for the case 8 = -j- in an external magnetic field is 
considered by the diagram expansion of the Green temperature function. The state equa-
tion of the Ising model is proposed in the ladder approximation. The calculation of the 
state equation is given as magnetization curves for the temperature region T J; Te and for 
magnetic fields H = 18 and 5 kOe. Also the Tyablikov equation is solved for the same 
temperatures and magnetic fields. The comparison shows a better agreement of the ladder 
approximation with the experimental data than the molecular field approximation or the 
Tyablikov equation.

We consider the three-dimensional Ising model with spin 1/2 in the external 
magnetic field H parallel to the z-axis. Second-quantized notation of spin 
operator Si localized at the lattice site i [1], 
leads in the Ising model to the system of N interacting fermions. The operators 
at, at obey the usual anticommutation relations. Then the Hamiltonian of the 
Ising model in the momentum representation

Now it is convenient to use the Feynman diagram expansion of the Green 
temperature function G(k) = (T(aka^)y [2], Then taking the self-energy part 
in some choice we obtain the corresponding state equation from the relation (1). 
At the present time two extreme approaches are successfully used in the many-
body problem. They are the high density approximation or the random phase 
approximation RPA and the low density approximation or the ladder ap-
proximation LA. Up to now there is no direct proof for advantage of RPA or 
LA to the Ising model. But the immediate numerical calculations using 
Joyce's solution of the Watson sum for the simple-cubic lattice [3J show that 
a solving of the state equation in the RPA [4] leads to a gap of the temperature 
dependence of the magnetization.1) Moreover our choice of the ladder ap-
proximation is justified by the fact that ferromagnetism has the advantage for 
a small electron densities [5]. 
2. Dyson Equation 
The renormalized irreducible self-energy part in the LA in terms of Mattuck 
[2] is of the form è

Since the Dyson equation is a non-linear integral we use the method of successive 
approximations. The Hartree approximation will be used as a first approxi-
mation [6]:

Note that the Hartree propagator (9a) is the solution of the self-consistent 
Dyson equation (6) with the renormalized self-energy

and independent of momentum k. Thus since JJ J(g) = 0 as follows from (3)

where, on the right-hand side, the factor ( — 1) is caused by the fermion loop 
arising from a connection of the propagator "handle" with the if-matrix.2) 
Finally substituting the i£-matrix (12) into (13) and taking into account (8), 
if we consider only z nearest neighbours, the Dyson equation can be rewritten 
as follows:

approximation. 
3. State Equation 
The state equation can be found easily if we know the Green function as is 
seen from (10). In order to calculate the Green function we use the transfor-
mation rules from the sums over com and ojt to contour integrals [7]. By applying 
this rules one obtains

Here F(x) = l/(e^ — 1) is the boson distribution function. With the fermion 
complex frequencies con and cot the following formula is obtained: 
F(icon - E ) - F(E - ¿to,) = f(E) - f(-E)

(16) 
where f(x) = l/(e^ + 1) IS the fermion distribution function, u1 is the relative 
magnetization in a first approximation or the molecular field approximation.

With this self-energy the Dyson equation (14) yields the second-order Green 
function Cr2(a)„). We note that the term (J(0)/2) (1 + <Tj) in (17) corresponds to 
the Hartree self-energy (9 b) evaluated with the Green function (9 a). It is 
clear that the calculation of the same self-energy with G2(con) will give the ex-
pression (J(0)/2) (1 + cr2) according to (10). So let us assume for simplicity 
= <r2 = a where a2 is the magnetization in a second approximation. Really 
this assumption can be made for the nth successive approximation for which 
the iteration process would converge so that a n - \ = a n = a. But the mathe-
matical difficulties do not allow to find even the third-order Green function. 
Thus the second-order Green function becomes 
with two poles

From the last few formulas for z->oo it can be seen that g~z, 
a^

and equation (22) reduces to (23), i.e. the ladder approximation for an 
infinite number of nearest neighbours coincides with the molecular field ap-
proximation. 
4. Summary of Results 
In addition we list the numerical estimates of the equations obtained and 
compare them with existing theoretical and experimental data. 
From the condition a —> 0 for p = 0 and t = tc putting z = 6 the Curie 
point numerically is found to be te = 0.81. It is well known that the correct 
theory must give the Curie temperature ic being smaller than the Weiss temper-
ature tc = 1 [8], 
Further to illustrate the state equation in the LA we consider the poorly 
studied temperature region T 2g Tc, the so-called nearest paramagnetic region. 
As experimental data we have taken the Mossbauer studies of the magneti-
zation 
on Ni in the external magnetic fields H = 18 and 5 kOe for the 
nearest paramagnetic region [9]. By comparing the Curie temperature of Ni 
Tc = 629.4 °K with tc = 0.81 given by (20) we obtain the exchange integral 
J(0). 
By inserting this .7(0) into (21) it was found that the magnetic field 
H = 18 kOe corresponds to p = 0.0012 and the magnetic field H = 5 kOe 
corresponds to p = 0.000333. With this values of p the state equations (22) 
and (23) were solved in the computer for t Si tc. Since the results of the studies 
[9] are expressed in terms of the effective field at the nuclei Hn we use the 
following expression for the experimental relative magnetization:

where <xcxp = HD(T, H)/H{0) and # n(0) = 280 kOe for Ni, Bm(x) 
is the Bril-
louin function, f = 2.6 is an empirical constant. As it is seen from Fig. 1 and 2, 
the LA results are in better agreement with the experiment than those obtained 
in the molecular field approximation (23). But excellent agreement is evidently 
not possible because the Ising model is the simplified model of ferromagnetism. 
Moreover, the solution of the generalized Watson sums by Flax and Raich [11] 
allows us to obtain the temperature dependence of the magnetization in the 
external magnetic field for the equation given by Tyablikov [12] 
— Jl 
and to compare them with'our results and experimental ones, too. Fig. 1 and 2 
show that the Tyablikov equation (24) only qualitatively describes the ex-
periment.
