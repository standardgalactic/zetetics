Abstract
In this article, we present GoCrystal, a new visual analytics tool for analysis and visualization of atomic config-
urations and thermodynamic energy models. GoCrystal’s primary objective is to support the visual analytics
tasks for finding and understanding favorable atomic patterns in a lattice using gamification. We believe the
performance of visual analytics tasks can be improved by employing gamification features. Careful research
was conducted in an effort to determine which gamification features would be more applicable for analyzing
and exploring atomic configurations and their associated thermodynamic free energy. In addition, we con-
ducted a user study to determine the effectiveness of GoCrystal and its gamification features in achieving this
goal, comparing with a conventional visual analytics model without gamification as a control group. Finally,
we report the results of the user study and demonstrate the impact that gamification features have on the
performance and time necessary to understand atomic configurations.

Introduction
The materials-by-design approach is a recent trend in
materials science aiming to design materials with
desired properties based on a predictive model of
material
behaviors.
In
the
materials-by-design
approach, atomistic computational simulations are
crucial to understand materials at atomic scales that
are intractable by experimental techniques. In addi-
tion, the combination of atomistic simulations and
data-science techniques, known as materials infor-
matics,1 has led leap-forward advancement in materi-
als-by-design by providing a capability to understand
relationships between material’s atomic structure and
properties.
One of the challenges in the materials-by-design
approach
is
the
difficulty
in
connecting
atomic
arrangements to comprehensive behaviors and proper-
ties of materials. For instance, the most stable struc-
ture
of
a
material
corresponds
to
the
atomic
arrangements with the lowest thermodynamic free
energy. However, the lowest energy atomic structure is
often not determined by a simple linear superposition
of
short-range
atomic
orderings
that
have
low

interaction energies. Moreover, as the size of the mate-
rial structure becomes larger, it becomes more difficult
for the user to understand how different atomic
arrangements affect the associated interaction energies.
The process of data acquisition, analysis, and decision
making for the atomic arrangement of the desired
materials can also create additional complexities.2
In this article, we present GoCrystal, a visual analy-
tics tool for assisting in identifying representative
atomic orderings (patterns of atomic arrangement in
local areas) and understanding how they interplay to
determine atomic configurations (atomic arrangement
over the entire structure), with its feasibility demon-
stration on a Li-ion battery cathode material system
(Li1þxNiyCo1xyO2). GoCrystal is designed to facili-
tate finding stable atomic configurations with mini-
mum thermodynamic energy by directly manipulating
atomic arrangements through visual interfaces. We
believe that visual analytics3 can present a promising
solution for materials-by-design, since it integrates
visual patterns of atomic arrangements with material
properties that can be predicted by computational
analytical methods.
GoCrystal supports a set of gamification features
that are designed to engage and assist users in examin-
ing atomic arrangements and discovering representa-
tive short-range atomic orderings. Gamification is
described as the method of applying game features
and rules in non-game contexts to engage users in sol-
ving problems.4 In GoCrystal, thermodynamic free
energy of a material is modeled as a function of atomic
arrangement and several constraints and conditions
are applied to simulate the natural processes of materi-
als synthesis and fabrication. These simulated con-
straints and conditions are then implemented and
employed as gamification features inspired by Go
and puzzle games. GoCrystal provides multiple game
levels as a gamification feature in which the user
solves different puzzles based on the number of
atoms, lattice sizes, and target thermodynamic free
energy requirements. Each level allows the user to
explore and understand how different arrangements
of atoms will affect local effective interaction energy
as well as global thermodynamic energy. Thus, these
gamification features can empower users to under-
stand how specific patterns in atomic arrangement
interplay to minimize the global free energy towards
a stable material.
To evaluate GoCrystal with our gamification fea-
tures, we conducted a user study in which we com-
pared GoCrystal using our gamification features,
against a visual analytics model without gamification
features, in order to assess the effectiveness and effi-
ciency of our approach in finding atomic configura-
tions.
We
also
investigated
the
impacts
of
our
gamification strategies on the discovery task. Based on
our study results, we discuss and explain improve-
ments enabled by GoCrystal and our presented gami-
fication techniques for visual analytics.
Theoretical background
The feasibility of GoCrystal is demonstrated via a
study for the LNC model (Li1þxNiyCo1xyO2). The
LNC model has R3m space group with one Li layer
and one transition metal (TM) layer which are arrayed
periodically, as illustrated in Figure 1. Although the Li
and TM layers are supposed to be separated in ideal
R3m space group, their intermixing is often observed
in reality. Hence, cationic lattice sites are assumed to
be occupied by any of Li, Ni, or Co.
In this work, the structure of the LNC model is rep-
resented as an atomic configuration in the 2D visual
space (Figure 1(b)). The atomic configuration of the
LNC model consists of two types of layers (TM and
Li), which are repeated along the slanted vertical axis
(lattice vector c in Figure 1 (a)). In GoCrystal, the
atomic arrangement of only one TM-layer is shown
rather than the entire structure of the LNC model, in
order to simplify structures of the atomic configura-
tion. The Li-layer is be assumed to be fully occupied
and thus is hidden. The lattice sites on the shown TM-
layer are allowed to be occupied by Li considering the
possibility of Li-antisite (Li in TM-layer).
Recall that the goal of our 2D representation from a
materials science perspective is to understand the pos-
sible interactions between Li, Ni, and Co and identify
the most favorable patterns—not to investigate all pos-
sible 3D configurations. In particular, the intralayer
interaction between transitional metal ions represents
a key feature in understanding the thermodynamic
and electrochemical performance of NMC-type Li-ion

battery cathodes. For the layered materials, the 2D
patterns can be repeated (stacked) across the entire
atomic configuration to form a stable 3D atomic con-
figuration. Favorable 2D atomic patterns are repeated
along TM-layer lattice vectors to construct a stable
3D atomic configuration.
The single-layer 2D model can effectively represent
3D atomic configurations through its periodic repeti-
tion along lattice vectors and therefore account for the
comprehensive
intralayer
atomic
interactions.
Accordingly, these 2D representations are broadly
used in materials science publications to show impor-
tant atomic patterns in the layered materials.5–7
GoCrystal also focuses on assisting in predicting
thermodynamic free energy as a function of atomic
configuration. Thermodynamic free energy of a given
atomic configuration was obtained by conducting
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calcu-
lation, which is the generally agreed de-facto atomistic
simulation method for thermodynamic free energy cal-
culation
of
battery
materials.
Vienna
Ab-initio
Simulation Package (VASP), a widely used commer-
cial software tool for electronic energy calculations,
was used for DFT calculations. The generalized gradi-
ent
approximation
with
Hubbard
U
correction
(GGA + U)8 was applied with the Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof parametrization,9 as implemented in VASP
in the PAW representation.10 U values of 3.4 and
6.0 eV were chosen for Co and Ni ions, respectively. A
cutoff energy of 520 eV was used and the k-point
mesh was adjusted to ensure convergence of 1 meV/
atom. The volume and shape of the supercell were
allowed to change during the relaxation.
In principle, we need to repeat the DFT calculation
for every possible atomic configuration to obtain the
thermodynamic free energy model of a material:
E
si
f
g
ð
Þ, where si indicates atomic species at lattice
site i (e.g. 3N DFT calculations need to be performed
for N lattice site ternary compounds). However, such
a
brute-force
approach
is
practically
impossible
because of the exponentially growing numbers of
atomic configurations with the number of lattice sites
and highly expensive computational cost of the DFT
calculation. Instead, we used the cluster expansion
(CE) method. The CE method is an efficient way to
identify the most representative atomic patterns and
the corresponding interaction energy from only a small
amount of data instances using a fitting-prediction
process with the help of data-science techniques, such
as
cross-validation
and
feature
reduction.
Once
obtained, the E
si
f
g
ð
Þ was used to predict the energy
while the users change the atomic configuration on
their own. Our prior works7,11 provide further infor-
mation on CE.
In GoCrystal, CE was applied for the LNC model
with 24 cation lattice sites in one layer and in total 167
data instances were used during the fitting-prediction
iteration to simplify the task. The resultant thermody-
namic free energy model is loaded as a form of data in
GoCrystal and is used to assist in identifying atomic
orderings and to predict atomic configurations with
minimum thermodynamic energy. The CE model used
in our user study is provided in the Supplementary
material.

In this section, we review prior efforts in visualization
tools for structural analysis, gamification, and serious
games, and compare them with GoCrystal’s capabil-
ities and features. To be specific, we explore existing

Visualization and visual analytics for crystal
structures
There exist a wide variety of molecular and structural
analysis tools that can help users to understand, simu-
late,
discover,
and
design
new
materials.12,13
GoCrystal is closely related to visualization tools for
determining and understanding crystal structures.
These tools focus on visualizing and rendering crystal
structures as resultant data generated with various
computational and simulation software tools, such as
Gaussian and GAMESS. Particularly, Izumi and
Momma14
proposed
VENUS
(Visualization
of
Electron/NUclear densities and Structures), which
consists of five independent visualization tools for
structural analyses. VENUS was specifically designed
to analyze and identify chemical bonds in crystal struc-
tures. To improve the usability and performance of
VENUS for understanding electron densities and crys-
tal structure, Momma and Izumi15 presented VESTA
(Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis),
a 3D visualization tool that visualizes electron densi-
ties, wave functions, and electrostatic potentials as
two-colored isosurfaces. The atoms and bonds in the
crystal structures are represented as ball-and-sticks
that are attached to a movable lattice plane, which then
enables users to investigate crystal structures in various
views and with multiple electronic configurations.
CrystalFp (Crystal Fingerprinting) is a project
aimed at solving problems for crystal structures partic-
ularly using visual analytics approaches. CrystalFp

allows users to select and validate crystal structures
produced
by
the
Universal
Structure
Predictor
Evolutionary Xtallography (USPEX) predictor algo-
rithm. For a large number of crystal structures pro-
duced with USPEX, CrystalFp supports efficient
classification of the crystal structures, as well as helps
users in exploring them by providing flexible visual
exploration methods. CrystalFp allows users to clas-
sify/cluster similar (or different) structures on scatter
plots and identify unique and potentially interesting
structures; accordingly, users can identify or remove
groups of duplicated structures.
In a typical structural analysis process, computa-
tional chemistry software tools produce atomic config-
urations and the aforementioned 3D visualization tools
are then used to analyze and understand the structure-
properties relationships. Updating a crystal structure
was still possible via such computational chemistry soft-
ware. Similar to VESTA or CrystalFp, GoCrystal was
designed to help the user understand crystal structures;
in contrast, however, GoCrystal focuses on simple 2D
visual representations to visualize and identify stable
crystal structures. Moreover, GoCrystal focuses on
understanding thermodynamic free energy as a function
of atomic configuration by varying atomic arrangements
manually.
Gamification for non-gaming applications
Gamification features continue to be adopted by a
wide variety of non-game applications and services as
a way of keeping users more engaged and motivated.
Multiple tools and studies have used gamification to
increase end-user participation, enjoyment, and per-
formance. Kankanhalli et al.17 developed a gamifica-
tion design guide to engage the user and increase work
performance. Domı´nguez et al.18 reported higher
scores and involvement among participants utilizing a
gamified learning system. Similarly, Thom et al.19
investigated the gamification of large multinational
organizations’
social
networks,
showing
that
the
removal of gamification features had a negative impact
on participation. Of primary relevance to GoCrystal is
the work of Ahmed and Mueller20 who presented a
gamification method as a paradigm for evaluating
visual analytics tools designed to motivate volunteers
to conduct tasks involving human perception and cog-
nition. While their methodology did employ gamifica-
tion successfully in requiring participants to assess
visual analytical tools, their work was not designed to
investigate the broader aspects of incorporating gamifi-
cation in visual analytics. In contrast, GoCrystal uses
gamification in its actual visual analytics features to
improve the efficiency of the whole analytical process
performed by users.
Diakopoulos et al.21 investigated the effectiveness
of using gamification techniques to enhance interac-
tions with infographics. They presented a gamified
infographic, Salubrious Nation (SN), for the purpose
of exploring US health data. SN includes two game
mechanics: Salubrious Guess (SG) directs users to
make inferences about the relationships between see-
mingly disparate pieces of data and their geographic
location, while Salubrious Eliminate (SE) is a color
matching game inspired by mobile or online matching
games like Bejewled or Snood. GoCrystal is similar to
SG in that users are making assumptions based on
visual patterns. Both GoCrystal and SN also allow
users to discover and throw out outliers, such as a
county that does not share the same statistical patterns
that its neighbors do in SN, or how some arrange-
ments of atoms may not reduce the interaction energy
as much as expected in GoCrystal. However, the goals
of guessing in SG or of eliminating counties in SE are
designed and introduced by the authors of the info-
graphic artificially to demonstrate the effectiveness of
their system, whereas the goal of GoCrystal to perform
the real-world material informatics exercise decided
semi-automatically by an algorithm.
In addition, there has been increasing interest in
the use of gamification for various online services.
Particularly, gamification methods have been used in
online services to help motivate people to achieve
required tasks. This broader incorporation of gamifi-
cation has primarily been inspired by existing game
features such as achievements, badges, trading cards,
and experience levels, which are comfortable and
familiar
to
users.
For
example,
LinkedIn22
has
employed gamification features as a way to make their
site more user-friendly while setting up new user pro-
files. Particularly, the account setup progress bar that
guides a new user in setting up his or her profile incor-
porates
features
of
gamification.
Often,
profile
strengths are ranked into categories such as ‘‘weak,’’
‘‘intermediate,’’ or ‘‘strong.’’ As a user adds more and
more required information to their profile, the bar
increases to represent the progress made. The progress
bar not only tracks the user’s advancements but also
has a text field that gives suggestions on how to
improve one’s profile strength. Steam,23 a digital dis-
tribution platform for gaming, also employs several
gamification features across its entire platform to
encourage making purchases within their online store.
Experience points (XP), achievements, levels, and
inventory items are all common methods that games
use to communicate with their audience, and the cus-
tomers may use such common game entities to enjoy
purchasing games.

employing a level
system as increasing challenges in
analyzing data, using a performance tracker as an
energy bar, and providing real-time feedback for every
action. In terms of solving scientific problems, we note
that although back-end calculations for determining
the thermodynamic free energy of an atomic config-
uration can be rather complex, users are able to inter-
act with and visualize essential information in a way
that is much simpler in GoCrystal.
Serious games for solving scientific problems
Several recent efforts in the science and engineering
arena have begun employing gaming and gamification
to solve and understand difficult science problems.
Particularly, Foldit24 is a multiplayer online game that
is designed to aid non-scientists in identifying new
protein structures. In Foldit, the players interact
with
the
protein
structure
visualizations
using
direct-manipulation techniques such as clicking and
dragging. Foldit offers players the opportunity to
simulate protein structures in solving real-world prob-
lems, such as identifying disease-related proteins or
identifying new plant proteins for faster conversion to
biofuels.
Splice25 is a puzzle game in which users manipulate
microbial cells to create a desired structure. This video
game is based on similar game mechanics integrated in
GoCrystal. In this instance, players need to rearrange
groups of microbial cells into each target structure in a
limited number of moves (called ‘‘splices’’). The game
requires the player to rearrange groups of cells by sim-
ply dragging them, but as the levels progress the player
must understand increasingly complex cells to create
target structures. In contrast to GoCrystal, at each
level a target cell structure is created based solely on
the cell positions without considering any other attri-
butes. Each level in Splice provides independent puz-
zles; conversely, GoCrystal’s levels are interrelated for
achieving the overall goal. GoCrystal employs a limita-
tion on resources in addition to the number of steps.
This limitation of resources and optimization with
number of steps encourages critical thinking while the
time mechanic adds pressure.
Hello Quantum is a puzzle game to assist people in
learning the fundamentals of quantum computing and
mechanics through playing a series of puzzles.26 It pro-
vides a basic concept of a qubit, which is the funda-
mental unit of information in quantum computing
corresponding to a bit in classical computing. In addi-
tion, the concepts that the user learns with Hello
Quantum can be tested on the IBM Q Experience, a
web-based platform which permits users to experi-
ment with and program for the prototype quantum
processor.27 Progenitor X is a narrative turn-based
puzzle game designed to help users understand the
basics of stem-cell science;28 it implements game ele-
ments to cultivate and differentiate stem cells, arrange
tissue, and replace organs that have been affected with
a virus. These games allow players to learn more
advanced science concepts and even help them con-
tribute to identifying solutions to real-world problems.
Similar to these serious games, GoCrystal not only
aids users in learning scientific concepts, but also pro-
vides a platform for users who are newer to such scien-
tific
concepts
to
solve
an
actual
problem.
The
programmatic deployment of the gamification features
described herein confirm that this approach can help
users and students learn potentially complex material
more effectively if they are engaged and challenged
with various game-like interfaces. We remain inspired
by these games in that they have been proven to help
students better understand and even solve problems in
complex scientific subjects.
Accordingly, we sought to develop GoCrystal as a
visual analytics tool to help users learn the concept of
materials-by-design
approach
more
successfully
through the incorporation of game features. Many of
these features would be familiar to students who have
grown up playing games—and others expand on some
of the features described in this section. We have inte-
grated familiar features—notably, levels, a time bar,
score, steps indicator, high score, energy indicator,
and the progression dynamics features—to engage
users in identifying more stable atomic configurations
and their associated patterns.
Design considerations
GoCrystal focuses on exploring and determining
atomic configurations based on thermodynamic free
energy and allows users to define the types of atoms on
their own. A design goal of GoCrystal is to keep users
engaged in the materials-by-design tasks and involve
them more in exploring and analyzing a large number
of relations among atoms through gamification fea-
tures. To facilitate these goals, we mainly decided to
use the following three design considerations:
D1: Visualize atomic orderings and their
effective interaction energy with simple visual
representation and multiple views
Generally, visualization tools for structural analysis
focus on presenting atomic structures in various 3D
representations; and materials science researchers use
such 3D structure visualizations to verify and check
output data generated by computational tools through
the use of 3D navigation approaches (zooming in/out,
300
Information Visualization 19(4)

panning, rotating the models, or changing the view
perspectives). However, it is not easy to use such con-
ventional 3D approaches to understand and identify
stable atomic configurations which have lower thermo-
dynamic free energy, since the task involves consider-
ing various aspects of results obtained from simulation
and computation.
In
contrast
to
existing
3D
structural
analysis
tools,12,29 GoCrystal can show how pairs or sets of
atoms form different relationships and generate effec-
tive interaction energies through its use of simple 2D
visual representations and interactive charts depicting
their associated energies. Particularly, our 2D repre-
sentation of atoms can simplify an entire atomic struc-
ture of multiple layers with a top-down view that is
able to show a large number of atoms simultaneously.
Although conventional 3D visualizations can generate
deeper insights into the overall atomic configuration
across multiple layers, it inevitably generates occlusion
that requires 3D navigation approaches to decipher.
In addition, inspired by prior work on coordinated
multiple views,30 this visualization approach can also
uncover unforeseen connections in and among those
atomic configurations in terms of their energy on mul-
tiple distinct views with brushing-and-linking.
D2: Interactively change and test atomic
configurations with respect to their associated
thermodynamic energies
In order to understand atomic configurations that
minimize corresponding thermodynamic free energy,
the user needs to examine a combination of diverse
atomic orderings and their associated interaction ener-
gies; particularly, the user should be able to compare
atomic configurations that consist of atomic orderings
by interactively manipulating the arrangements of
atoms in a lattice. The analytic tool associated with
this task should be able to provide a method for keep-
ing track of which selection of atoms would produce
the more desirable results in terms of their interaction
energy and why. In this regard, GoCrystal provides
users with effective visual interfaces to facilitate chang-
ing the atomic arrangements and comparing resultant
energies from these atomic orderings and configura-
tions. Beyond passively inspecting individual structural
models, GoCrystal helps users identify target atomic
configurations by directly changing arrangements of
atoms in the lattice. The user’s input for changing
atomic
orderings/configurations
should
also
be
reflected on the corresponding thermodynamic energy
in real time. Specifically, the user can change types of
atoms in the layer in order to examine how certain
changes of atomic arrangement impact local energies
(i.e., interaction energies) based on relationships with
nearby atoms (i.e. atomic ordering), as well as the
overall thermodynamic free energy. To achieve this
goal, GoCrystal also provides visual feedback for
user’s changes in atomic configurations, which enables
the user to see how updated atomic configurations
would affect the associated energies.
D3: Facilitate materials informatics processes
through gamification
The materials science researcher typically needs to
investigate a large number of potential arrangements
of atoms, as well as their corresponding effective inter-
action energies, in order to design materials. Such
design/discovery processes can be tedious and time-
consuming. Moreover, it may be confusing and intimi-
dating for a new user.
Thus, we chose to adopt gamification features to
help keep users interested and motivated in identifying
atomic orderings with lower effective interaction ener-
gies resulting in the stable atomic configuration for a
given lattice. The concept and practice of gamification
are expanding across a variety of application domains.
The key goal of incorporating aspects of gamification
into GoCrystal is to make the visual analytics tasks
more enjoyable so that users will remain engaged in
the task.
The various elements in a game can be divided into
two gamification design elements: game mechanics
and game dynamics.31

Game mechanics: Mechanics indicate the inputs
and actions afforded to the user, both of which
cause certain outputs or responses to play a game.
One critical piece of any good game design is that
it must contain constraints and conditions, gener-
ally referred to as ‘‘game rules’’ and ‘‘stages’’ for
playing a game. Thus, this design element is
related to a set of game features that specify how
the user plays a game. Specifically, they can be
implemented as a set of the game systems such as
points, limited resources, and attributes assigned
to game characters. In GoCrystal, we integrate a
set of game elements based on game mechanics,
such as time constraints, scoring, levels, level attri-
butes, with the visual analytics process.

Game dynamics: Dynamics refer to how the
mechanics of a game make gamified activities or
experience
enjoyable.
In
contrast
to
game
mechanics—which are controlled by the designer—
game dynamics are related to the reactions and
experiences of the user, which vary from person to
person. For instance, game dynamics will feature
Chung et al.
301

emergent behaviors and processes such as collabora-
tion, unexpected challenges, and solving processes
that may be unique to every user of GoCrystal. We
exploit game dynamics as a form of user’s discovery/
visual analytics process that arises when a user plays
a collection of our gamified features to solve materi-
als informatics problems. Particularly, GoCrystal
emphasizes ‘‘Progression Dynamics,’’32 which focus
on displaying a player’s level of success. This notion
of progression dynamics also helps users gradually
improve their discovery process through the com-
pletion of ‘‘granular tasks’’ that have been semi-
automatically decided in terms of data size and
attributes.
Based on these two design elements for gamifica-
tion, we implemented gamification features that can
be applied to solve the visual analysis problems for
identifying stable atomic configurations with the low-
est thermodynamic free energy possible (see the
‘‘Gamification features’’ section for details).
Visualization design
GoCrystal supports multiple visualization views for
atomic orderings and their associated effective interac-
tion energies (four bar charts for the effective interaction
energies) (Figure 2(i)). The purpose of these multiple
views is to visualize atomic arrangements and their inter-
action energies in the layer as well as to facilitate identi-
fying and creating stable atomic configurations.
The layer
In the layer (Figure 2(h)), the atoms are represented
visually by circular objects which reside in the lattice
and corresponding interaction energies are also visua-
lized with simple shapes. The layer enables users to
create various atomic orderings, which are the arrange-
ments of atoms in the layer. The arrangement of atoms
in the layer serves to denote different types of energy
relationships with other atoms in terms of different
effective energies among the atoms.
Atoms and lattice. In GoCrystal, atoms are repre-
sented with colored circles that refer to a specific ele-
ment, namely Lithium (green)
, Cobalt (blue)
,
and Nickel (red)
. Although we selected these three
types of atoms for the feasibility of the system for our
study, these three atoms can be applied to other mate-
rial systems with redefinition of types of atoms depend-
ing on the thermodynamic energy model of the
material systems. The basic color choice for these three
atoms in GoCrystal is based on the color scheme used

in VESTA,15 but if the system were extended to sup-
port a new materials system, we would consider more
intricate color schemes for the atoms. Specifically, we
would select the CPK color convention,33 which can
cover most of the elements in the periodic table and is
categorized according to specific atomic properties.
The basic visual design of the layer was inspired by
Go in which the user places atoms of these different
elements with their own color on the lattice, consider-
ing interaction energy among the atoms in the layer.
Note that the symbols for these atomic elements—‘‘Li’’
(Lithium), ‘‘Co’’ (Cobalt), and ‘‘Ni’’ (Nickel)—are
used to label the center of each circle. These circular
atom shapes can then be arranged in an 8 3 9 lattice
(72-atom cells), forming different ordered arrange-
ments of atoms in a crystalline material.
Initially, all of the 72 lattice sites in the layer are
filled with Lithium (i.e. green circles). The user can
then begin to switch atoms of choice by clicking on
them to create and identify a specific atomic configura-
tion. When a user changes an atom in the layer, the
associated thermodynamic free energy is calculated
accordingly based on all of the atomic arrangements in
the lattice (see the Supplementary material for details).

These
atomic
orderings
then constitute an atomic configuration (Figure 4).
Importantly, different types of atomic orderings produce
effective interaction energies, which partially decide the
thermodynamic free energy of the constructed atomic
configuration in the entire lattice (Figures 4(g) and (h)).
Thus, when a user decides atomic orderings and their
resultant atomic configuration, they should consider
how different arrangements of atoms affect the effective
interaction energy of atomic orderings as well as the
overall free energy from the atomic configuration.
GoCrystal visualizes four different types of effective
interaction energy patterns associated with atomic
orderings. Each of the following patterns can be dis-
played selectively by user, who can choose one or mul-
tiple patterns with the associated checkbox user
interface.

Short Pattern: The short pattern represents the
effective interaction energy between any two adja-
cent atoms in the lattice. As shown in Figure 3(a),
the interaction energy of the short pattern is repre-
sented with a yellow-colored line connecting with
two adjacent atoms. The width of the line indi-
cates the corresponding level of interaction energy
formed between the adjacent atoms. The wider
the line, the greater the interaction energy between
the two atoms.

Triangular Pattern: The triangular pattern rep-
resents the interaction energy among three adja-
cent atoms in the lattice. As shown in Figure 3(b),
an interaction energy value generated by three
atoms is represented with a purple-shaded triangu-
lar tile. The corresponding level of energy is indi-
cated with color saturation: the deeper the purple,
the greater the interaction energy among the three
atoms.

Long Vertical Pattern: The long vertical pattern
is used to visualize the interaction energy value
between the two atoms placed at positions along a
vertical direction (but not adjacent atoms) in the
lattice. As indicated in Figure 3(c) the width of the
green-colored lines connecting two atoms vertically
indicates the amount of effective energy between
the two atoms placed vertically in the lattice, with
wider lines pointing to greater interaction energy.

Long Diagonal Pattern: The long diagonal pat-
tern represents a value of the effective interaction
energy between two non-adjacent atoms placed
diagonally in the lattice. As depicted in Figure
3(d), the corresponding energy between two atoms
is represented with blue lines of varying widths.
Similar to the other patterns, the width of the blue-
colored lines indicates the amount of the energy
between the atoms.
Bar charts for effective interaction energies
To assist the user in comparing the effective interac-
tion energies produced by different atomic orderings,
GoCrystal provides four bar charts (Figure 2(i)). Each
bar chart presents a different interaction energy in
increasing order, which is associated with an atomic
ordering of different types of atoms. The y-axis of each
chart represents the interaction energy that each
atomic combination produces in electron volt (eV),
while the x-axis represents different ordering patterns
among atoms. Each of the bar charts shows how asso-
ciated effective interaction energies can be varied in
terms of pairs/sets of different types of atoms within
each atomic ordering. Note that the scale of the y-axis
is constant across all the four bar charts to help the
user compare the effect of the four types of atomic
orderings on their corresponding interaction energies.
In addition, all of the four bar charts support brush-
ing-and-linking, whereby the corresponding interac-
tion energy for each atomic ordering pattern in the
lattice can be highlighted in the bar chart (Figure 3);

the different interaction energy representations).
Gamification features
GoCrystal utilizes basic puzzle game features to solve
the materials-by-design problem that is associated with
each level (see Table 1). Employing aspects of gamifi-
cation into GoCrystal is likely to enhance a user’s
engagement, thus motivating him or her to continue
interacting with the system and working toward a goal.
As
we
discussed
in
our
design
considerations,
GoCrystal’s gamification features are based on two
standard gaming elements: (a) Game Mechanics and
(b) Game Dynamics. In this section, we describe in
detail these gamification features, which encompass
familiar game-inspired elements.
Game mechanics
As
we
described
in
the
‘‘Design
consideration’’
section, game mechanics refer to defining game sys-
tems and rules. GoCrystal users would encounter
increasingly challenging levels to motivate and encour-
age them to solve more complex problems. Moreover,
each level of GoCrystal has a different target energy, as
well as a constraint on the different number of atoms
that are available. GoCrystal supports the following
gamification features based on game mechanics.
Game goal. A user should identify an atomic config-
uration with minimum interaction energy. Figure 4
shows a workflow of how the user would construct
atomic
orderings
and
atomic
configurations
using
GoCrystal. A single atomic configuration can be formed
by combining and arranging atomic orderings regularly,
and each atomic ordering can also consist of atomic
orderings in a smaller area. For example, two Ni-Co
patterns (Figure 4(a)), which produce minimum effec-
tive energy, can form a single triangle pattern which is
then formed into a single hexagon pattern (six Ni atoms
and one Co) (Figures 4(a)–(d)). Based on how these
hexagon patterns are arranged across a layer, their resul-
tant thermodynamic energies are different. Thus, the
user should decide how the hexagon patterns can be
arranged more efficiently (Figure 4(e) and (f)) to create
an atomic configuration with the minimum thermody-
namic free energy. The final task will be to determine an
atomic configuration by efficiently repeating the pattern
in a lattice achieving the least amount of thermody-
namic free energy (Figures 4(g) and (h)).

Levels and level attributes. In GoCrystal, the levels
play the role of ‘‘milestones’’ in a user’s analytical
progress toward reaching stable atomic configuration.
At each level, the user will be tasked with solving sim-
ple puzzles to identify an atomic configuration with
minimum energy, thereby enabling them to complete
the final goal of determining the most effective atomic
configuration for the layer. Thus, the overall problem
is deconstructed into smaller, level-specific problems,
which are also combined at the final level to achieve
the complete solution. Specifically, each level in
GoCrystal has different level attributes. These level
attributes are displayed as a pop-up menu before the
beginning of each level and throughout the game play
(Figures 2(b), (g), and (l)). The following level attri-
butes are varied depending on the level, but increase
the level of complexity and difficulty in solving a puz-
zle for each level.

Target Energy: Users are presented with a target
thermodynamic free energy for each level. The
user must reach the target energy goal to ‘‘win’’
that
level
and
move
on
to
the
next
level.
Specifically, when the user creates an atomic con-
figuration that produces the least energy possible
for that given lattice, the level is completed. As the
user advances from level to level, the target energy
values
become
less,
thereby
increasing
the
challenge.

Time: GoCrystal incorporates a time limit for
completing each level, which increases level-by-
level based on the size of the lattice and the num-
ber of atoms to be arranged. Failing to determine
the correct solution within the time allotted ends a
level, prompting the user to start over at the
‘‘failed’’ level. Faster completion times are recorded
on a leaderboard.

Layer Size: For each stage, the layer (lattice) size
that the user employs to arrange atoms to create
an atomic configuration is different. As the user
progresses from level to level, the size of the layer
increases.

Types of Atoms: At each level, different types
and sets of atoms (we used Li, Ni, and Co for the
study, but other types of atoms can be added) are
available for creating an atomic configuration. As
the user progresses from level to level, the available
types of atoms to be used in the layer can increase.
Based on these four attributes, users will be chal-
lenged to complete each level before they can advance
to the next level—thereby integrating a ‘‘reward’’

system that encourages them to continue the game.
Note that the user can only advance sequentially
through levels. Should the user need to terminate the
session and wish to resume it later, he or she can use
the level-select screen at the beginning of the game.
Similarly, when users fail a level, they can also select
and restart that level or previously completed levels
from the screen. GoCrystal tracks and saves each
user’s progress based on the user name entered at the
beginning of the session. The user can pick up where
they left off or try a different solution with an unsuc-
cessful level rather than starting from scratch.
In many puzzles or educational games, specific level
conditions and attributes are manually designed by the
game designer who has prior knowledge of all informa-
tion about the available problems and solutions.25,26
However, solutions for unanticipated analytical prob-
lems may not be available until an analyst actually con-
ducts a specific analysis and determines all answers to
emergent questions. To support this characteristic of
visual analytics tasks, GoCrystal determines the level
attributes for each level in a semi-automatic manner
(Algorithm 1). Table 1 shows actual attribute values
generated by Algorithm 1; these levels and level attri-
butes were incorporated into our user study.
Particularly, our level algorithm focuses on produc-
ing the level attributes based on the lattice size, avail-
able types of atoms, the number of moves, and time.
A target energy for each level is calculated based on
these level attributes. Initially, the user sets a target
thermodynamic free energy value to be achieved; then,
according to the number of levels (e.g. 6 levels) and
the maximum values for all other attributes, the algo-
rithm generates proportional values for the attributes
at the levels. For an actual analysis scenario, the user
can set this target attribute value to be achieved
according to their analysis goals.
Our level algorithm controls the final level sepa-
rately, which involves assigning the maximum values
for all the attributes. We should note that the values of
the level attributes are increased gradually from level 1
to the penultimate level. To be exact, the algorithm
increases the values of the level attributes randomly
and marginally based on the prior level’s values until
the penultimate level. But when the final level is
reached, the algorithm assigns the user-defined maxi-
mum values for all attributes in order to generate the
most challenging level in terms of the available size
and types of atoms. The target energy value is also cal-
culated based on these assigned attribute values at the
final level.
Energy indicator. The energy indicator denotes the
output thermodynamic free energy of an atomic con-
figuration for the layer (Figure 2(j)). The goal of
GoCrystal is to arrange different types of atoms (e.g.
Li, Ni, and Co) on a layer in order to identify the

atomic configuration with the lowest thermodynamic
free energy in electron volts (eV) possible. The energy
indicator shows the overall energy produced by a com-
bination of all atomic ordering patterns in the lattice
in a range of 12,000 eV to –1,000 eV (Figure 2(j)).
For each level, the user should reduce the thermody-
namic free energy for an atomic configuration below a
certain target thermodynamic free energy by forming
an atomic configuration. As illustrated in Figures 2(j)
and 4(g) and (h), when a user conducts such a task
with GoCrystal, a blue energy bar will show the ther-
modynamic free energy which the user has achieved so
far. Importantly, this visual aid also indicates the mini-
mum energy level under which the user must stay in
order to win and advance to the next level. As noted,
it also shows and provides the target energy by display-
ing an indicator line on the energy bar (a thin white
line on the bar in Figure 2(j)); thus, the user is guided
by a target energy level that they must achieve to
advance to the next level.
If the user updates an atomic orderings and config-
uration in the layer, a corresponding thermodynamic
free energy is computed and updated accordingly. The
bar increases or decreases indicating the current energy
value generated by the overall atomic pattern on the
layer. The energy indicator is an important visualiza-
tion, since it shows the user how close they are to win-
ning the level and reaching the desired solution—as
well as imparts a sense of accomplishment.
Time bar. As noted, every level in GoCrystal has a
specific time limit during which the player must reach
the target design goal. The time limit changes with
every level proportionally, and is represented at the
top of the screen with a time bar and a numeric value
(Figure 2(c)). The time bar indicates how much time
(in seconds) remains for the user to determine the
required atomic arrangement. At the beginning of
every level the entire length of time bar is orange in
color, which then decreases according to the time
remaining. The amount of time allocated for each level
is decided based on the complexity of the problem,
and the user must achieve the assigned goal within
that specific period to complete a level. As a game
mechanic, a time limit indicator adds a degree of chal-
lenge in the form of time pressure to the user’s task,
but can also encourage the user to make decisions
more efficiently toward achieving the final game goal.
Real-time notification. GoCrystal includes real-time
notifications in the form of an ongoing response from
the system based on the user’s actions/progress. Since
the goal of each level is to reduce the energy of the
material below a certain target energy, the real-time
feedback feature of GoCrystal provides information on
energy and other factors that indicate how the user is
performing on the task, as well as suggests corrective
action to better achieve the goal. For instance, the
immediate feedback from changes in atomic arrange-
ments can help users perform the task more attentively.
For every atom change in the lattice, the energy change
value is shown for 4 seconds in a small pop-up mes-
sage around a changed atom. In addition, an upward
or a downward arrow indicates an increase or decrease
in the energy. The user can also use this feature to ver-
ify the outcome of their actions immediately, in addi-
tion to checking on detailed views such as the bar chart
and the atom status table.
Score. The score feature (Figure 2(d)) is designed to
motivate users to work competitively toward a higher
score (Figure (2f)), since individual scores from other
users are used to create a high-score leaderboard. Both
the user’s score and the high score are displayed in the
top right corner of the screen (Figures 2(d) and (f)).
The score is calculated based on (a) the achieved ther-
modynamic free energy value, (b) the time consumed,
and (c) the number of steps which represent a change
of atoms in the lattice. Specifically, we used the follow-
ing formula to calculate the score at each level:
score =

also
incorporates
reward features in the form of bonuses for completing
a level more efficiently. First, upon completion of each
level, the next level is unlocked as a form of reward.
Bonus points are also offered based on the amount of
time remaining in the level and the number of atoms
being used. In addition, time extensions are given as a
reward when a user is able to decrease the energy con-
tinuously during a consecutive number of atomic
changes; for a streak of five atom changes that do not

result in any increase of energy, three seconds are
added to the level’s time limit.
Game dynamics
In GoCrystal, Game Dynamics can take the form of
new and personalized analytical processes that emerge
from playing with game features, leading to the cre-
ation of atomic configurations with minimum thermo-
dynamic energy. There are two game dynamics that
could be emerged from different features of GoCrystal.
Problem-solving strategies. Throughout GoCrystal’s
analytical tasks, the user is required to apply a number
of different atomic arrangements in the lattice—and
then observe and understand how the effective ener-
gies among different sets of atoms have changed. A
user may apply different atomic arrangements that
facilitate solving puzzles to reduce a thermodynamic
energy—but they are also encouraged to come up with
and apply their own strategies for solving the problems
at multiple levels. The status table displays part of level
attributes, but it is also designed to help the user deter-
mine different approaches according to the attribute
changes. This table (Figure 2(g)) persistently shows
both the maximum number of available atoms for the
three types (i.e. Li, Ni, and Co) and the number of
atoms being currently used on an ongoing basis in a 3
3 3 table format. If any atom type reaches its maxi-
mum count based on the level conditions, the associ-
ated atom is highlighted in red, and the user will not
be allowed to use the corresponding atom type in the
layer. In response to this case, the user must change
the number of atoms. This constraint can encourage
the user to come up with an emergent idea to create a
more effective atomic configuration using a limited
resource.
Progression dynamics. The Progression view (Figures
2(k) and 5) allows users to explore atomic configura-
tions that they selected previously during their tasks.
At each level, users may extend or even reuse the solu-
tions identified from earlier levels, thereby advancing
their knowledge and skills to discover target atomic
patterns. In particular, the game dynamics incorpo-
rated in GoCrystal assist users in gradually improving
their skills by completing smaller tasks at each level.
This type of gradual improvement is also known as
progression dynamics,32 which refer to how incremen-
tal findings and activities contribute to solving a
broader problem. To better support the idea of pro-
gression dynamics, we incorporated a provenance fea-
ture34 in order to trace the history of the atomic
configurations that the user has selected at each level.
This feature provides the user with a way to compare
the current thermodynamic free energy with those pre-
viously identified and even return to a specific atomic
configuration if desired.
Importantly, this feature enables the user to restore
a prior atomic configuration in the layer and recovers
a more efficient state (in terms of lower energy) that
the user has selected during the analytical process at
each level. As shown in Figure 5, the Progression view
looks like a line chart overlaid with clickable data
points (red dots); its x-axis represents last ten atomic
configurations, and the y-axis represents the associated
thermodynamic free energy values with these atomic
configurations. Each clickable data point allows users
to see how thermodynamic free energies correspond-
ing to different atomic configurations have been chan-
ged during their
tasks. An atomic configuration
previously selected by the user can be recovered by
clicking on these points.
Evaluation
To understand the effectiveness and efficiency of our
visual analytics approach with gamification features in
conducting the visual analytics task, we performed a
controlled
lab
study
comparing
two
versions
of
GoCrystal. The first version included all the gamifica-
tion features described in earlier sections; the second
version did not include any gamification features
except the energy indicator, which is an essential fea-
ture for checking the thermodynamic free energy pro-
duced by an atomic configuration. In terms of their
assigned task, participants were asked to identify the
stable arrangement of atoms that would produce the
least amount of energy possible for the given lattice
size. We envisioned that gamification features would
enable
users
to
identify
the
required
atomic

arrangements. Accordingly, we formulated the follow-
ing hypothesis for this study:
H1: The gamification features of GoCrystal can lead
to a better performance in identifying the stable
atomic configuration with the lowest thermodynamic
free
energy
than
a
conventional
visual
analytics
system.
Study method
Participants. In total, 30 participants ages 18 to 30
were recruited to take part in this user study. The 25
males and 5 females were graduate or undergraduate
students from a local university, who were studying
some field of engineering, computer science, or busi-
ness administration. The 30 participants were rando-
mized and assigned to one of two groups of 15
participants each: (i) the Gamification Group (GG),
which conducted the task using GoCrystal with all of
its
gamification
features;
and
(ii)
the
Non-
Gamification Group (NGG), which utilized the ver-
sion of GoCrystal without any gamification features
except the energy indicator. Some of them had prior
experience using data visualization tools, but had little
acquaintance
with
some
concepts
in
materials
sciences. Overall, participant interest in games varied
from spending 0–2 hours of gaming per week, to more
than 25 hours per week.
Task. For this user study, participants in both groups
were asked to engage in an identical discovery task for
the stable atomic configurations. Specifically, partici-
pants were given 50 minutes to identify the most stable
atomic configuration within an 8 3 9 lattice that would
produce the lowest thermodynamic free energy possi-
ble. For the target solution, participants were expected
to identify and create a tiling of the lattice using identi-
cal hexagonal patterns with six Ni atoms on the edges
and one Co atom at the center (Figure 4(e)), which
would produce the least thermodynamic energy. The
GG participants needed to conduct the task using the
full range of GoCrystal’s gamification features by com-
pleting multiple levels based on their associated level
attributes, which were computed using Algorithm 1;
thus, they used the attributes for each level as shown in
Table 1. Conversely, the NGG participants performed
their task without the levels as well as other gamifica-
tion features except for the energy indicator.
Procedure. At the beginning of the study session, par-
ticipants were asked to complete biographical ques-
tionnaires. The study session was undertaken using a
desktop computer with an Intel Xeon E5-1620 CPU
and 16GB RAM connected to a 27’’ monitor with a
resolution of 3840 3 2160 pixels. Prior to engaging in
the actual user study, each group was given a demo on
a GG or NGG version of GoCrystal, with an addi-
tional 5 minutes allotted for exploring and becoming
familiarized with the interface and interactions. Then,
the experimenters explained the task they would be
asked to complete over the course of the 50-minute
session: identifying optimal atomic arrangements with
the lowest possible energy levels. After the study tasks,
the participants also completed the post-study survey.
Each study session was observed by the experimen-
ters, who made detailed notes on how participants
interacted with the interface. With the exception of
two participants from NGG, all other participants
were able to finish the task within the allocated time of
50 minutes.
Data collection and analysis. We used three perfor-
mance measurements to compare overall task perfor-
mance between the two groups.

The task-completion time indicates the dura-
tion of time spent by each participant in seconds
from the beginning to the end of the task session.
For the GG participants, the time represents the
sum of the time spent (in seconds) for each level,
including any retries for the levels (GG).

The number of steps indicates the efficient atom
changes executed by the participant throughout the
entire task. Note that each click on an atom that
changes a type of the atom in the lattice site is con-
sidered as one step (move). For GG, the sum of all
the steps executed by each participant during all
levels (including replayed levels) was calculated.

The performance score is achieved by the parti-
cipants in both groups. Each participant starts
from zero points, and the system added or sub-
tracted points to the performance score, propor-
tional to the amount of energy changes based on
each atomic change. It must be noted that for GG
we evaluated the scores achieved during the last
level only; in contrast, for the NGG participants,
their scores were based on the entire task session.
For a fair comparison between both groups, we
used the revised performance score—minus three
factors (the task-completion time, the number of
steps, and the level-completion bonus) from the
original score formula.
At the end of the study we asked each participant to
complete a subjective feedback questionnaire. After
collecting all data from the user study, the data from
both the GG and NGG groups were tested for

normality of distribution using Shapiro-Wilk test.
Since the resultant data was not normally distributed,
we performed the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U
test on the collected data to determine the significant
difference between the two groups for these measures.
Results
The study results are shown in Figures 6–8. In addi-
tion, we also evaluated the post-study survey collected
from participants after the completion of tasks. The
results and the post-study survey are described in this
section, with discussion of these results deferred to the
next section.
Performance and completion time. We measured and
compared performance scores and task-completion
times between the two groups, noting a significant dif-
ference in both the average of the task-completion
times (Figure 6) and the performance scores between
NGG and GG (Figure 8). For the task-completion
times—which is the number of seconds each partici-
pant spent to identify the target atomic configuration
for the entire task time—Mann–Whitney U testing for
both groups revealed a significance level of 0.05, indi-
cating a difference between the two groups. Overall,
the GG participants consumed less time to complete
the tasks significantly. Specifically, between the two
groups (U = 23, p \ 0.001), we found that the GG
participants (mean = 915.2 s, s = 626.576 s) were
able to complete the task quicker than the NGG parti-
cipants (mean = 2172 s, s = 707.825 s). In assessing
the entire task-completion time recorded throughout
the entire task session, we confirmed that the GG par-
ticipants were able to complete the task faster when
compared to the NGG participants.
In addition, we observed that the GG participants
used fewer steps to complete their tasks (Figure 7).
Fewer steps to complete the task implies that partici-
pants used effective atom changes with fewer efforts
throughout the entire process. For the number of
steps—which corresponds to the number of atomic
changes each participant made to identify the target
atomic configuration—Mann–Whitney U testing for
both groups revealed a significance level of 0.05, indi-
cating a performance difference between the two
groups. Overall, the GG participants utilized fewer
steps to complete the tasks. Specifically, between the
two groups, we found that the GG participants
(mean = 621.6, s = 506.263) were able to complete
the task with fewer steps than the NGG participants
(mean = 727,
s = 303.194).
However,
we
were
unable to confirm a significant difference (U = 73,
p = 0.101) in the number of steps between the GG
and NGG group. We attribute this result to the fact
that the GG participants had to work on multiple lev-
els; moreover, 5 of 15 GG participants retried levels 4
and 5, which increased the number of steps.
During the final level for the GG group, partici-
pants worked on the same tasks with those of the
NGG participants, in terms of the lattice size, number
of available types of atoms, and a target energy.
Importantly, both groups were required to discover
the same complete atomic configuration. Regarding
the performance scores between GG and NGG, we
identified a significant difference between the two
groups (U = 11, p \ 0.001) in that the GG partici-
pants (mean = 1099.052 points, s = 45.630 points)

were able to earn more points compared to the
NGG (mean = 794.858 points, s = 106.750 points)
(Figure 8).
User experience. We also evaluated the user experi-
ence of both the GG and NGG participants who were
asked to rate their overall experience using GoCrystal.
The post-study questionnaire included nine questions
(Q1–Q9), which each person answered using a 7-point
Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly
agree). Detailed results of the subjective responses are
presented in Figure 9. The questions were categorized
and directed to evaluate the four overarching aspects
of GoCrystal: tool-evaluation (A1, A2), engagement
and motivation (A3–A6), visualization (A7), and
materials-by-design (A8, A9). For the tool-evaluation
category, two questions were asked to examine the
impact of the presented gamification features on the
completion of the given task: This tool helped me to
achieve the final goal (A1); and Tasks were mentally
undemanding (A2). Four questions were asked in the
engagement/motivation category: This tool was fun to
use (A3); This tool kept me engaged throughout the task
(A4); This tool motivated me toward the final goal (A5);
and I would recommend this tool for other similar tasks
(A6). For the visualization category, one question was
asked to determine the degree to which the visual ana-
lytics features helped participants complete their tasks:
Visualizations helped toward the final goal (A7). Finally,
two questions were included to determine their under-
standing of materials-by-design concepts: GoCrystal
increased my confidence on materials by design (A8); and
I will be able to solve more complex problem (A9).
This overall subjective feedback was assessed to
evaluate the ability of GoCrystal to assist users in gain-
ing expertise in the given field. On average, the GG
participants answered slightly more positively (mean =
6.2, s = 0.402) for all of these questions in compari-
son
to
the
NGG
participants
(mean = 5.840,
s = 0.371), even though there was no significant dif-
ference
between
the
two
groups.

questions, we observed larger differences between the
two groups for two questions A1 and A5. Therefore,
the results appear to show that gamification features
would be useful for identifying the stable atomic
configurations.
Discussion
Overall, our evaluation partially supports our study
hypothesis that the GG was more effective and effi-
cient in identifying the stable atomic configuration in
comparison to the NGG. The study results demon-
strated significant differences in task performance
between the two groups with respect to time and
scores. Moreover, the GG participants reported they
enjoyed conducting the tasks, even though they had no
prior experience with the area of materials informatics.
Impact of gamification on visual analytics
tasks
We further analyzed how gamification would affect the
analytical process and tasks for identifying more effec-
tive atomic configurations. Since most of the partici-
pants were not familiar with materials science or
chemistry, they did experience some difficulties in
understanding the materials science concepts, which
did hinder their progress at the beginning of the study
session. According to feedback from the GG partici-
pants, it appeared that they were able to understand
the problem and concepts gradually by completing
lower levels. As the levels progressed, the GG partici-
pants were able to find the atomic configurations in
less time since they could better understand the con-
cepts. As such, the GG participants could extend the
solutions from lower levels to complete the puzzles at
the higher levels. On the other hand, the NGG partici-
pants took longer to grasp the problem. In fact, in
struggling to understand the concepts, two NGG par-
ticipants gave up on the task completely (after 40 and
50 minutes); the response given by the NGG partici-
pants who failed to complete the task was that they
could not understand how to find the required atomic
configuration and it was not motivating them to con-
tinue further. The two NGG participants recom-
mended including tips or instructions that would
provide additional information on how to complete
the task.
Using subjective feedback after the study and our
own observations, we sought to further understand
how participants employed the gamification features
and multiple visualization views of GoCrystal to
understand the atomic configurations and their rela-
tionships to the thermodynamic energies. Initially, we
expected that the participants would first come to
grasp the relationships between atomic orderings and
interaction energies on the bar chart, after which they
would determine the precise positions of atoms in the
lattice based on that understanding. Interestingly,
however, all the participants in GG started the task by
randomly changing atoms. After manipulating atoms
in the layer, they simply investigated how modifying
the atomic orderings would impact the corresponding
interaction energy on the bar chart or the energy indi-
cator. Even though the bar charts enabled them to
ascertain which pattern has lower interaction energy
compared
to
others,
analyzing
such
information
required taking extra time to encode and memorize it
before applying this understanding in the subsequent
decision
on
atomic
orderings/configurations.
It
appeared to show that directly manipulating atoms
and seeing the resultant atomic ordering in the lattice
helped participants better understand relational pat-
terns/atomic configurations and their energies. This
behavior is closely related to epistemic action,35 in
which space is used to offload cognitive work in aid of
computation. There are various analogous examples
of epistemic actions, such as actual movement of
pieces within a game space for playing Tetris.36 These
prior examples emphasize directly manipulating and
arranging some artifacts (i.e. atoms in GoCrystal) with
an available space, rather than mentally computing a
solution.
Longitudinal and qualitative studies
In real-world materials informatics scenarios, the
exploration of various atomic patterns is crucial for
understanding and predicting the characteristics of
particular material systems. For our user study, we
invited graduate students with no prior knowledge of
this domain area to conduct the study tasks. Although
this approach may have reduced its ecological validity
to a small degree, we believe that the use of non-
domain experts increased its authenticity in better rep-
resenting a diverse range of learners and analysts, as
detailed below.
Our study task did not require any specialized
domain knowledge of materials science, and our gami-
fication techniques were designed to engage and moti-
vate users in the challenging tasks of making inferences
about the relationships among a particular set of
atoms, which they were tasked to do based on arrange-
ments of atoms and associated effective interaction
energies. These inferences can be used to construct
favorable patterns. In our study, the participants were
required to make logical connections between the
effective energies and structures of atoms, in order to
draw
informed
conclusions
about
atomic
312
Information Visualization 19(4)

configurations. Even though one expert may be well
acquainted with one particular materials system, it
may not be easy for that same person to identify favor-
able atomic patterns for a new or different materials
system and they are likely to use similar inferences to
those done by the non-expert users. Thus, we designed
our study tasks such that users who may or may not be
skilled in materials informatics must apply human
judgment
and
intuition
to
determine
those
connections.
Nonetheless, our study focuses on evaluating the
effectiveness of our gamification techniques by mea-
suring a set of performance metrics that are generated
by interacting with the system. We did not examine
qualitatively how the system assists domain experts in
solving real-world problems with its gamification fea-
tures, or how the overall materials-by-design process
could be impacted by the developed gamification tech-
niques. Similar to other data-analytics processes, this
atomic discovery/understanding task is very explora-
tory in nature. Thus, we still need more longitudinal
use cases conducted by domain experts, which will also
facilitate examining the impact of both gamification
and prior knowledge on solving complex problems.
Flow and reinforcement
Our study result showed that gamification has a posi-
tive impact on task performance. Specifically, we argue
that GoCrystal provides benefits along two major axes:
flow37 and reinforcement.38
Flow. In the context of our study, the term ‘‘flow’’
refers to a mental state wherein the game player is fully
immersed and engaged in an activity, thereby enhan-
cing the probability that they will achieve a known goal.
Accordingly, we focus on specific aspects of flow factors
that increase the likelihood of achieving flow on visually
assisted discovery tasks in GoCrystal. One important
factor for directing a player toward a flow state is to
provide appropriate and achievable challenges. To fos-
ter flow through challenges, the flow activity requires
maintaining a balance (called ‘‘flow channel’’) between
boredom and frustration by increasing or decreasing
the difficulty level as needed.39
GoCrystal engages users and encourages them to
remain in the system by providing gradually increasing
challenges through its multiple levels and level attri-
butes. Specifically, the values of level attributes are
increased (or decreased according to different attri-
butes) gradually from level 1 to the penultimate level
(see the Score section for details), making the subse-
quent levels more challenging than all prior levels.
Thus, our level algorithm approximates the ‘‘moving
straight up’’ model in which the level of challenge is
increased linearly. It should be noted, however, that
the ‘‘tense and release’’ model is considered to be more
effective in maintaining a player’s focus, since it is con-
sidered to more easily foster human enjoyment.39 This
type of model is represented with a repeating cycle of
increasing challenge, followed by an easier period of
reduced challenge.
For the improved version of GoCrystal, we will
investigate a new algorithm that will generate the levels
that oscillate between easy and difficult with the goal
of enhancing excitement while minimizing anxiety.
GoCrystal’s redesign involves modifying its level algo-
rithm by increasing and decreasing the level attribute
values among different levels, rather than linearly
increasing the difficulty or challenge for each level.
Reinforcement. In GoCrystal, reinforcement involves
the successful performance of specific actions (reduc-
ing the thermodynamic energies for atomic configura-
tions) in order to encourage users to achieve a final
goal. It has long been known that both positive and
negative reinforcement can foster desirable beha-
viors,40 both of which can be incorporated as new
game mechanics in GoCrystal.
Positive
reinforcement.
Positive
reinforcement
is
designed to increase the motivation for a participant to
engage in the discovery tasks. In GoCrystal, it is pro-
vided as a reward for good performance, which is
implemented as extended time, high-score/best-time-
record, and energy bonus for a player’s strong perfor-
mance
(i.e.
identifying
the
optimum
atomic
configuration).
As positive reinforcement, performance records
with respect to correctly identifying stable atomic
orderings/configurations,
quicker
completion
time,
and higher overall score can be shared with other par-
ticipants. In our study, we found that the participants
are naturally inclined to want to see the leaderboard to
compare their records/scores with other participants—
both after each level and at the close of the study ses-
sion. In addition, such performance records can be
used to confirm if their atomic orderings and config-
urations represent the best solution for each level. In
fact, looking at the leaderboard, some participants
with lower scores were interested in knowing what the
best solution to the task problem actually was.
However, since this performance information from
other users was provided at the end of every level and
at the close of the session, it is questionable whether
the timing of this feedback element did actually
heighten each individual’s competitive spirit, thereby
enhancing performance directly while they were work-
ing
on
the
tasks.
Thus,
we
will
redesign
the
Chung et al.

leaderboard feature to indicate the best score directly
on the time bar during the task time. In addition, this
feature may be applied for collaborative visual analy-
tics tasks in the future to motivate collaborating ana-
lysts to be more engaged in given analytics tasks.
Negative
reinforcement.
Negative
reinforcement
occurs when a certain stimulus (usually an aversive sti-
mulus) is removed after a particular behavior is exhib-
ited. The likelihood of the desired behavior occurring
again in the future is therefore increased because of
removing/avoiding
the
negative
consequence.
In
GoCrystal, the aversive outcome (a poorly ordered
atomic structure in terms of its energies) involves
increasing the effective interaction energies from the
atomic orderings or the overall atomic configuration.
However, GoCrystal does not generate aversive situa-
tions as challenges or game mechanics for negative
reinforcement. In a future version of GoCrystal, we
would consider new game mechanics that provide
additional challenges based on important physical phe-
nomena related to materials systems. For instance, in
each layer atoms of the LNC model can automatically
swap their positions based on temperature changes,
and these unintended position changes of atoms will
make it difficult for the user to create favorable atomic
structures. Thus, temperature must be managed to
avoid unwanted changes (as aversive stimulus) in
atomic configurations and achieve the final goal, sup-
porting negative reinforcement.
Integrating gamification with computational
approaches
In the realm of materials informatics, data mining and
machine-learning approaches are often used to identify
stable atomic configurations with respect to their low
thermodynamic energies. These computational methods
are becoming increasingly useful for identifying larger-
scale combinations of atomic orderings for a variety of
materials systems.1,41 In fact, our prior work employed
such computational models for identifying new atomic
configurations7 such as patterns of Va-Va.6 Although
powerful, many computational methods require signifi-
cant research effort and time in order to devise appro-
priate algorithms for understanding different materials
systems. In addition, such research will often require
high performance computing (HPC) resources.
We believe that GoCrystal is able to overcome these
common barriers for investigating advanced materials
system as an alternative approach. The new visual
representations and interaction methods based on
gamification enable both the expert and novice analyst
to decipher and understand complex atomic structures
and patterns for favorable materials. As our user study
showed, GoCrystal’s gamification features benefited
non-expert analysts who lacked deeper knowledge of
particular materials systems in discovering meaningful
atomic arrangements, thereby enabling them to jump-
start their discovery process.
In our ongoing efforts to amplify the impact of
GoCrystal, we continue to investigate how advanced
gamification approaches can provide an interactive
form of visual analytics that better integrates gamifica-
tion features with more sophisticated computational
analytical methods—the goal of which is to empower
the user in investigating the field of materials infor-
matics involving large-scale data.
Limitations and new gamification features for
visual analytics
Based on feedback from our study participants, we
examined the problems identified with the current ver-
sion of GoCrystal and what new gamification tech-
niques could be incorporated in a subsequent visual
analytics design.
Support ‘‘Game-like’’ hinting and tutoring. According
to participant feedback, one problem with GoCrystal
was that the first few levels were somewhat confusing
and intimidating to a new user due to multiple views
and the large lattice with many visual objects (i.e. cir-
cles and lines)—despite the fact that we provided
tutorial sessions prior to commencing the study.
Multiple leading game designers agree that the first
15 minutes of play are crucially important to any
interactive experience: ‘‘A player must be actively
engaged by a new game within 15 minutes of starting
or we risk losing the player forever.’’42 In order to
ensure that GoCrystal better engages the user in the
visual analytics tasks, we will create a new level algo-
rithm that can simplify the first few levels.
In addition, we discovered that the materials science
theories behind the materials-by-design task were not
sufficiently explained to users. Thus, while GoCrystal
does contain a box that reminds the player of their goal
and provides some technical information (Figure 2(l)),
it does not contain any type of hints or early level tutor-
ial system to guide the user toward the most effective
solutions. This view will instead be used to provide
real-time instructions according to different conditions
and user selections, while at the same time guiding
them through what actions they should be performing
to obtain the desired result.
In general, ‘‘game-like’’ hinting features are often
useful in puzzle games because when players get stuck
they are more likely to stop the task, or even give up
(which is what two of the NGG participants did). To
314
Information Visualization 19(4)

mitigate this problem, we will investigate how hinting
features can be incorporated in a visual analytics sys-
tem. One possibility is utilizing computationally gener-
ated suggestions or solutions as a hint with more
game-like interfaces. However, these features require
constantly detecting and tracking the user’s analysis
problems and behaviors with the goal of providing
users with relevant information on a timely basis.
Identifying
users’ difficulties and providing more
appropriate hints and suggestions can represent a new
research agenda for visual analytics.
Narrative and story for visual analytics. Even though
GoCrystal focuses on conducting a materials-by-
design task related to battery design using a game-like
context, the design of its features and user interfaces
emphasize more visual analytics aspects. Thus, the
system still lacks essential game elements such as game
characters, a story, and an engaging environment.
Since incorporating a story in games is important for
keeping a player’s attention and connecting them on a
deeper emotional level with the game, we could con-
sider developing a game narrative that would ‘‘hook’’
players and motivate them to complete visual analytics
tasks. For instance, we could assign users the virtual
role of battery designer/scientist and ask her or him to
design more effective battery materials using GoCrystal
in an interesting (fictional) situation. Indeed, under-
standing the critical environmental importance of more
efficient battery design is timely, to say the least. Instead
of visualizing interaction energy in simple bar charts, we
could represent the energy as light levels of a bulb, or
cost/mile of an electric car based on its battery capacity/
efficiency.
Support
different
analysis
scenarios
and
domain
experts. The design goal of the time bar feature is to
engage and motivate the analyst to work on simplified
analysis problems using gamification in order to
achieve the final goal as quickly as possible. However,
depending on available data and the specific materials
analytics task, a longitudinal analysis may be more
appropriate; in such instances, the time bar feature
may not be as effective. Instead, to better support dif-
ferent analysis scenarios, we can consider two game
modes: User and Sandbox modes.

User modes: GoCrystal can support a range of
different users in varying analysis contexts using a
modal interface. Specifically, by choosing different
settings the user can determine how game mechanics
in GoCrystal will behave, as well as whether each
game element should be user-controlled or not.39 By
selecting the different modes, users can conduct their
analysis
without
time
limits,
or
certain
game
mechanics may not be included.

Sandbox mode: We can also enable the user to
change the style of game mechanics between a
level-based game and a sandbox game which
allows the user to play in a more nonlinear manner
(e.g. Simcity’s Sandbox mode43). In Sandbox
mode, users can create and modify their own work
environment without being channeled by prede-
fined goals or a progression requirement where
tasks can only be unlocked sequentially. For
instance, we can consider some sandbox game fea-
tures (e.g. game missions and mini-games) based
on the storylines selected by users—rather than
held to time limits, levels, and so on.
Promote
a
deeper
search
for
the
entire
atomic
configuration. The
current
design
of
GoCrystal’s
leveling features and the progression view centers on
identifying the local optimum values (target interac-
tion energies) for the lower levels, and then exploiting
and combining the identified solutions in order to
determine the atomic configuration with the minimum
energy. Thus, at the lower levels a user can focus on
searching for the effective atomic orderings (the local
optimums), while at the higher levels the user is
required to do a deeper search for global optimums
using identified atomic patterns that will satisfy the
overall thermodynamic energy.
In the current system, however, the user must go
through the entire process of creating identified atomic
orderings repeatedly at each level, rather than focusing
on the global optimum. For instance, one interesting
observation
involved
one
GG
participant,
who
appeared to search indiscriminately for the atomic
orderings rather than carefully considering arrange-
ment patterns of atoms and their effective energies at
each level. This participant tended to arbitrarily
change all atoms at each lattice site, mostly while
referring to fluctuations in the progression graph.
In response, we want to avoid this tendency to ran-
domly search for the local optimum in identifying the
favorable atomic configurations. Instead, we would
consider new features that will enable the user to save
atomic orderings at lower levels, and then use them
when they find and create a broader atomic configura-
tion as groups of atoms at higher levels. Specifically,
these saved atomic orderings could be used to identify
an atomic configuration that features the minimum
thermodynamic energy by easily manipulating them as
a group in the lattice, instead of repeatedly creating
each atomic ordering. Thus, we expect that the user
can focus more on identifying atomic configurations in
terms of global thermodynamic energy.

Conclusion
Understanding atomic configurations and their associ-
ated thermodynamic models as required for a materi-
als-by-design
task
can
be
time-consuming
and
complicated. We believe that GoCrystal presents an
interesting opportunity for advancing materials infor-
matics, as well as visual analytics, because it facilitates
visual analysis of both stable visual patterns of atomic
arrangements and thermodynamic free energy using
gamification features. The processes of materials
synthesis and fabrication create a set of constraints
and conditions that could be converted into a set of
game features. GoCrystal uses gamification features to
incentivize the player to achieve a stable material pat-
tern with the lowest effective interaction energy, and
fosters rapid exploration for atomic orderings as a
means to achieve this goal. As part of a user study, we
showed how our application of the presented gamifica-
tion features to a simplified materials-by-design prob-
lem could improve task-completion times and lead a
better performance with GoCrystal.
Our future work consists of investigating additional
gamification features for visual analytics systems, such
as a hints and tutorial system, as well as narrative and
story elements. We also expect the generalized gamifi-
cation elements that make up GoCrystal to be applied
and tested with other visual analytics tools that focus
on identifying visual patterns in different application
domains.
