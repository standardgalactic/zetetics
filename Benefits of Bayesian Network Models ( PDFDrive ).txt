Foreword by J.-F. Aubry
Systems Dependability Assessment is the title of a series of books,
of which this is the third. The preface to the ﬁrst series described the
reasons why the authors embarked upon writing these books: in recent
decades, they have made signiﬁcant contributions to recent approaches
to the predictive dependability of systems by considering concepts
developed in other scientiﬁc ﬁelds but not yet applied to account of
dependability. All these authors belong to the Automatic Control
Research Center (CRAN, Centre de Recherches en Automatique de
Nancy) of the University of Lorraine, France, a research laboratory
whose activities are widely oriented towards the diagnosis, reliability,
maintainability and safety of systems, which can be described in one
word: dependability.
Assessment must be understood as the set of means, methods and
tools to provide quantitative measures of dependability, and in these
books we are interested in providing predictive measures by using
probabilistic approaches. The ﬁrst two books were dedicated to
methods based on the frequentist knowledge of basic elements of a
system and on models describing how the failure of this system
depends on those of its components. These models are essentially of
state-transition type, such as ﬁnite state automata and petri nets, and
results were obtained by analytic or simulation approaches according

x
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
to the level of complexity introduced, and data inputs for these models
were probabilistic distributions of elementary events that were derived
from strong feedback. This is within the approach called the frequentist
or objective of probability theory.
The present book is different as it is based on Bayesian networks.
Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to probabilities were both
developed at about the same time in the 18th Century, but the ﬁrst
approach culminated in industrial development in the 19th Century,
eclipsing the second. The original mathematical formulation of
subjective probabilities was made almost simultaneously by Laplace
and Bayes, the latter having given his name to the theorem of
probability of causes. The Bayesian approach supposes an a priori
knowledge, even if only approximate, of an event probability. From the
knowledge of the a priori probabilities of the event and of its cause, the
Bayes formula gives an a posteriori probability of the event, its
likelihood function somehow describing the causal dependency. It is, in
fact, a means of improving the knowledge of the event probability.
Bayes theorem can be materialized by a causal decision tree and
extended to represent chained causality in a system. This is the base of
Bayesian networks. With the development of computing technologies,
the second half of the 20th Century saw the return of Bayesian
methods, being an efﬁcient tool to aid decision making in an uncertain
environment. They provided solutions to problems such as climate
change prediction or, more recently, the detection of spam in data
communications.
Dependability assessment problems do not escape from Bayesian
approaches. CRAN was among the ﬁrst to promote these techniques,
proposing methods and tools in association with industrial users and
developers. Original works have been conducted, especially in the
dependability of multi-state systems, integration of environmental and
operating constraints in reliability computation (dynamic context) and
interaction between the dependability and control of systems. The

reader will ﬁnd in this book a clear presentation of all these advances

Foreword by L. Portinale
Probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian belief networks, in
particular,
have
deﬁnitely
become
a
reference
formalism
in
dependability modeling and assessment. The graphical structure,
together with the compact representation of the joint distribution of the
system variables of interest, provides the reliability engineer with a
powerful tool at both the modeling and analytical levels.
The dependency structure, induced by the graph component of the
formalism, allows the modeler to make explicit a set of reasonable
independence assumptions that may lead to huge simpliﬁcation at the
computational level, as well as with respect to the problem of
probability elicitation, without compromising the suitability of the
model produced to the actual real-world application.
Standard dependability models usually ﬁt into two categories: 1)
combinatorial models (as fault trees or reliability block diagrams) –
they determine the occurrence of an undesired event through a
combinatorial composition of sub-events; this class of model is very
easy to analyze, but it cannot model situations involving complex
dependencies
among
system
components
and
sub-systems;
2) state–space models (such as Markov chains or petri nets) – they
allow complex interactions among system parts to be modeled, but
they may incur the “state-explosion” problem; this usually means that

xiv
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
the analysis has to be performed by considering the cross-product of
the system variables, producing a potentially huge number of states.
Bayesian
networks
and
related
models
allow
for
efﬁcient
factorization of the set of system states, without the need for an explicit
representation of the whole joint distribution; moreover it has the
additional advantage of inference algorithms available for the analysis
of any a posteriori situation of interest (i.e. evidence can be gathered
by a monitoring system and fed into a dependability framework for
fault detection and identiﬁcation). Finally, when time is explicitly
taken into account, models such as dynamic Bayesian networks result
in a factored representation of a Markov chain, providing a framework
with the modeling advantages of state–space models, without the
drawbacks at the analytical level.
The present book, written by some of the most respected
researchers and practitioners in the ﬁeld, provides a comprehensive
presentation and analysis of the probabilistic graphical model approach
to dependability, providing a view of the different facets involved in
real-world dependability applications: system reliability, maintenance
and risk evaluation. The main objective is to devise a principled
approach to the modeling of complex dependable systems, with the
aim of supporting decisions in an uncertain and evolving setting. This
supports and promotes Bayesian networks and probabilistic graphical
models as some of the most relevant and important formalisms in
modern dependability analysis.

Introduction
I.1. Problem statement
Since the beginning of the 20th Century, our perception of
technological artifacts has continued to evolve and ranges from
complicated systems to complex systems combining technical, human,
organizational
and
environmental
components.
The
ﬁrst
major
accidents, such as the Flixborough blast [DEP 75], the Three Mile
Island accident [KEM 79] or the toxic cloud at Seveso [SEV 82] that
occurred at the end of the 1980s, have highlighted the role played by
humans and their organizations in the failure of technical systems. The
analysis of these accidents helps us to understand that the components
are not independent. Thus, they have to be considered jointly to assess
the true risk presented by our industrial systems.
Nowadays, the technological objects used are taken in their
environment and are deﬁned as complex socio-technical systems. The
increase in complexity is due to the complexity emerging from the
interdependence
between
technical,
human,
organizational
and
environmental components. A system is a set of elements interacting
with each other with shared dependencies.
Faced with regulations, industrial systems are now required to have
a high level of risk management. This level should be continuously
demonstrated and proved [DE 12]. It is also necessary to handle
socio-technical systems from a global point of view. To cope with this,

xviii
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
dependability analysis and decision-making methods should be
improved. Dependability analysis is primarily focused on technical
aspects to assess the intrinsic safety of a system and should take into
account human, organizational and environmental factors. Companies
need good assessment tools to determine their requirements. They also
need to anticipate future trends/developments to better manage or
optimize the consequences of their activity on people, goods and the
environment, as well as their social and societal impact.
To manage the industrial system, the engineers produced models
during the lifecycle of a plant to predict its future functioning states.
These models are extracted from our knowledge of the systems and our
objective. There are several aims in dependability analysis. For instance,
the following items are particular areas of interest in the Research
Center for Automatic Control of Nancy (CRAN) in the University of
Lorraine1:
– models that can assess the impacts of maintenance activities on the
ability to maintain operational conditions and to aid decisions during
maintenance;
– models that can assess the impacts of control and pilotage activities
on wear, degradations (faults) or failures of all or part of the system.
Thus, they satisfy the main goals, i.e. service quality, low-risk situations
for users, staff, environment, etc.;
– models that help assess the efﬁciency of means to warrant an
acceptable level of risk, whatever the operational constraints and
environmental perturbations.
There are several domains of application of dependability. These
domains can be associated with different aspects of system functioning
such as management modes, governance, human factors, extreme
events or rare events and their consequences on society, maintenance,
control and supervision or risk reductions of socio-technical systems,
etc.

Introduction
xix
Nevertheless, most engineers have neither the tools nor the methods
to effectively understand the whole information set (knowledge and
evidence) according to the operational constraints and disturbances
that condition the functioning of socio-technical systems. This is the
main paradigm regarding the management of socio-technical systems.
The phenomena encountered are so complex, as a result of their
heterogeneity and the number of nested mechanisms of different
natures, that it is quite difﬁcult to continuously meet the required
objectives or levels of performance. Moreover, there are no exact
analytical models that can describe all the phenomena encountered. It
is also impossible to know all of the system states and to know and
observe all of the component states at each point in time in order to
determine the optimal decision. Engineers should bear in mind that all
models are biased and partial. As a result, engineers need new methods
to solve these modeling problems.
It is necessary to model systems and their components with a ﬁnite
but unbounded set of states or performance levels, i.e. with multiple
state systems. In addition, the component behaviors are conditioned by
the operational constraints and environmental disturbances of the
system. In such cases, dependability assessment becomes difﬁcult
because it should take into account the combining effects of dependent
failures due to constraints, disturbances and the intrinsic multi-state
nature of system components. This results in an increasing quantity of
scenarios to model. It is cumbersome for the analyst and enforces bias
and partiality.
Quantitative assessments are necessary to warrant the viability of
systems and their performance regarding risk and dependability. It is
thus necessary to handle an uncertain representation of the system to
describe its functioning and dysfunctioning. This imperfect perception
naturally leads to a probabilistic view of system states. The main
difﬁculties are the integration of a huge amount of information to
model industrial or socio-technical systems subject to a large set of
interactions with its environment. To contribute to the solution of this
modeling problem, this book shows the application of graph theoretic
and probabilistic approaches using Bayesian networks (BN) in

xx
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
maintenance, risk analysis and management, as well as in control
theory. Why is this choice made? In 2004, the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) published the rank of the next ten main
revolutions in the industrial area. The use of BN was in fourth position.
In this book, the authors aim to formalize probabilistic graph model
approaches like BN to solve different kinds of problems associated
with dependability, maintenance and risk in complex systems. The
book is oriented towards applications and the transfer of modeling
methodologies to the industry and engineers. It does not focus on the
algorithmic point of view, but on ways in which to build models for the
dependability analysis of industrial systems. The book is inspired by
some industrial problems the authors helped to solve with BN in
several sectors.
The approach followed in the book is to link mathematical
formalisms and their uses in industrial cases, industrial needs and the
possibility of models. To do this, it is necessary to:
– generalize and homogenize the scientiﬁc paradigms from several
industrial problems in an inductive way and then to specify solutions to
applications in risk, reliability, maintenance and control;
– formalize and adapt methods to solve new industrial needs;
– promote these methods beyond the specialist community and adopt
the standardization processes to integrate these methods.
In addition, two classes of problems need to be solved:
– the modeling of risk management, maintenance and reliability for
socio-technical systems;
– the integration of knowledge of reliability in the control and
diagnosis of automated systems.
The objectives of the book are to contribute to:
– modeling of complex systems to aid decisions in an uncertain
context by proposing an efﬁcient modeling method for the new
challenges as socio-technical considerations;

– taking into account the propagation of uncertainties in complex
system models, especially the uncertainty due to unknown future
operational conditions;
– joint

risks

organizational and human risks in the analyses;
– managing

of
components,
by

the
maintenance and safety actions with respect to aging;
– increasing the operational time with the objective of ensuring
safety, risk management and quality even if faults or failures occur;
– allocating control efﬁciently to reduce the risk according to
component criticality, health state and operational conditions.
To address these key points, the probabilistic framework and,
particularly, BN formalism are used. BN are not completely accepted
by
the
industry
because
the
formalism
does
not
handle
a
dependability-oriented semantic. In addition, the BN formalism is not
proposed in usual standard modeling methods such as fault tree
analysis2, Markov chain3, reliability block diagram4, event tree
analysis5 and petri nets6.
Currently, engineers mainly ask for the proof of correctness of
models and results. The proof of computing correctness has been
described in [PEA 88]. Thus, the remaining question concerns the
correctness of the model built by the analyst. As BN offer a generic
modeling framework, the subsequent question is how to attach a
semantic to the model through a modeling methodology which is
independent of the application. Moreover, the models obtained should
achieve at least the same results and possibilities as well-recognized
approaches. So, one objective of the book is to show and promote BN
as a reference method.

I.2. Book structure
The scientiﬁc goal of this book is to formalize the probabilistic
models of system functioning and dysfunctioning. The models built
serve to assess the satisfaction of operational requirements and
performances and the safety requirements through reliability and risk
analyses. For this purpose, a system-centered model has to take into
account the impact of the operational environment, control and
maintenance strategies on the system health. These requirements are
necessary because the engineer should maintain and optimize the
quality of services performed by the industrial artifacts in use.
The probabilistic models are built by expertise and knowledge
formalized from different types of standard modeling methods
(FMEA7, HAZOP8, IDEF09 and structured analysis and design
technique). The available data are considered as inadequate or are
insufﬁcient to build the model by learning algorithms. In the following,
we propose the knowledge structuring principles that ensure a valid
dependability model. The book gives examples of our scientiﬁc
method to deﬁne the structure of probabilistic graphical models.
The book is organized as follows:
– Chapter 1 presents BN as a modeling formalism for system
dependability. The modeling capability of a BN is explained by showing
the relation between the joint probability over the system states and the
system reliability. An academic system model illustrates the adaptability
of the method to the dependability modeling problem of multi-state
systems.
– Chapters 2 and 3 present BN as an easy, intuitive and smart
formalism to modeling the structure function of complex and multi-state
systems. These chapters introduce the principles for structuring a BN

model in dependability. Several representations of the same problem
are given and the chapters show the links between representations
on the basis of the example given in Chapter 1. Some industrial
applications are discussed to show the applicability of the modeling
methods developed in the following PhD work and projects [LÉG 09,
FAL 12, MED 11, ANR 11].
– Chapter 4 presents the integration of the temporal dimension in
modeling based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN). This chapter
explains different models of stochastic processes and describes the
elegant representation provided by DBN for component reliability
modeling. It ends with a discussion on modeling complexity and
the difﬁculties in computation while merging several multi-state
components into the model of the system. This allows us to understand
the limitations of the approach and the work that still needs to be
completed. DBN modeling is the solution adopted in Ben Salem’s
PhD thesis [BEN 08] to solve a diagnostic problem based on temporal
sequences of events.
– Chapter 5 presents an integration of the DBN model of system
reliability in a dynamic system control problem. The mutual inﬂuence
of reliability on control and the control on reliability is exhibited. This
chapter is based on work developed in Guenab and Khelassi’s PhD
theses [GUE 07, KHE 11].
– The conclusion focuses on the three major contributions of
scientiﬁc research conducted at CRAN in the domain of probabilistic
graphical model application in dependability.

Bayesian Networks: a Modeling
Formalism for System Dependability
For complex systems, it is assumed that the system and the
components have a ﬁnite number of states or operating levels. If the
number of states is reduced to 2, then a binary hypothesis is used;
otherwise the system and its components are multi-state. In this case,
the evaluation of the reliability of the system becomes difﬁcult, as it
must take into account the effects of combinations of failures that are
not independent of the multi-state nature of the system components.
The result is the development of numerous modeling scenarios that
become tedious for the analyst. In such cases, standard modeling
procedures are insufﬁcient, mainly due to their basis in Boolean logic
or their need for (computationally expensive) randomized simulations.
As mentioned in [BOU 99], the modeling methods that come from
artiﬁcial intelligence such as Bayesian networks (BN) can provide an
effective support in control or maintenance areas, or in risk reduction
for industrial systems. BN have powerful modeling and analysis
capabilities. They provide a formal framework to handle or process
probabilistic events by representing them using discrete random
variables [PEA 88, JEN 96]. The relationships between them are
represented by conditional probabilities. BN models are based on a
powerful
formalism
of
expressing
complex
dependence
and
independence between multi-state random variables. This formalism is,

therefore, well suited to the representation of complex multi-state
systems.
The application of BN in dependability analysis is a recent
development. Their popularity has grown in the ﬁeld of reliability
analysis since the late 1990s [TOR 98, KAN 99]. According to
[WEB 12b], up to 200 papers among 7,000 references have covered
this ﬁeld during the last decade.
Many of the signiﬁcant papers in the application of BN to
dependability have focused on demonstrating the equivalence between
BN and conventional methods used in probabilistic risk assessment
(PRA). For instance, Torres-Toledano’s works [TOR 98] state the pro
and cons of BN with respect to reliability block diagrams (RBD).
Bobbio’s works [BOB 01, BOB 03] explain how a fault tree can be
transformed into a BN. In addition, [BOU 05b, BOU 05a, BOU 06,
POR 10] describe the dynamic fault trees in dynamic BN and
[WEB 02, WEB 03, WEB 06, BEN 06] link DBN with Markov chains.
At the same time, new modeling methods using BN modeling
capabilities have emerged. One of the ﬁrst papers [MAH 01] has
proposed a methodology using BN for the assessment of infrastructure
reliability. This methodology allows us to model two important
characteristics of large structures: the modeling of multiple failure
sequences and the correlations between the critical states at the
component level.
The following papers [MUL 04, LÉG 09, MED 13, MED 15] have
focused on a new methodology that is used to build BN models and to
justify BN models for the reliability and risk analysis of complex
systems. The publication of [BEN 13] has offered a method of
construction for BN structure based on the cuts, to assess the
performance of multi-state systems. These papers give clear motivation
for using BN in dependability compared with conventional modeling
methods.
Several survey papers [LAN 07, LAN 08, WEB 12b] have provided
a good overview of BN applications in the domain of dependability.

Unfortunately, this modeling formalism is not yet fully accepted in
industry. The French Institute of Risk Management (IMdR) has
supported several projects to promote BN modeling. The IMdR P04-7
project [MUN 07] assesses the appropriateness of BN modeling for
seven dependability problems posed by industrialists and the IMdR
P09-2 project [GUY 09] addresses the issue of BN modeling
validation.
1.1. Probabilistic graphical models: BN
In this section, the BN formalism is introduced as a probabilistic
graphical model [PEA 88]. Mathematical objects are based on graph
theory and probability theory. A BN represents a factorized model of a
joint probability distribution of several discrete random variables.
Graph theory provides the algorithms required to analyze graphical
property. Probability theory brings a formalism to quantify the
dependencies between variables by introducing conditional probability
laws.
1.1.1. BN: a formalism to model dependability
The probabilistic graphical model (PGM) considered here is a
directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG comprises nodes and directed
edges. Nodes can be classiﬁed into two classes: parent nodes and child
nodes. A parent node is a node with outgoing edges while a child node
is a node with incoming edges. A parent node is called a root node if it
has no incoming edges. A child node is a leaf node if it has no
outgoing edge. Each parent node x in a graphical probabilistic model is
assigned a marginal probability distribution P(x) and each child node
E is associated with a conditional probability P(E|pa(E)), where
pa(E) is the set of all parent nodes of E. For instance, in Figure 1.1
pa(E2) = x2, x3 and pa(E1) = x1.
PGM is deﬁned by the structure of the graph and the probabilistic
parameters. According to the graph structure shown in Figure 1.1, the
a priori probability laws are: P(x1), P(x2) and P(x3); while
the
conditional
probabilities
are
P(E1|x1),
P(E2|x2, x3)
and

P(y|E1, E2). The conditional probabilities are deﬁned by a conditional
probability table (CPT) as a matrix giving the probability distribution
of the variable with respect to the Cartesian product of its parent
variable states. For instance, the conditional probability P(y|E1, E2) is
given in Table 1.1 for the {hy
1, . . . , hy
n} states of y, according to the
{hE1
1 , . . . , hE1
n } states of E1 and the {hE2
1 , . . . , hE2
n } states of E2.

DEFINITION 1.1.– A PGM represents the joint probability distribution
of
a
set
of
random
variables
by
using
the
conditional
dependence/independence relationship between them. A DAG is used
to represent the variables and the dependence relationships between
them. Each variable is characterized by a probability distribution
deﬁned conditionally based on its parent’s variables in the graph.
1.1.2. Inference mechanism
Like several other modeling tools, BN are interesting for their
graphical aspect. However, the probabilistic inference mechanism is
more interesting and is the actual strength of the tool. Thanks to this
inference, a BN is able to compute the marginal probability distribution
of any variable according to:
– the realizations or measurements of observed variables (evidence);
– the likelihood regarding the state of certain variables;
– an a priori knowledge about the probability distribution of
unobserved variables;
– the conditional probability distribution between variables.
The inference mechanisms are explained in [JEN 96, PEA 88] and
are outside the scope of this book. Nevertheless, several inference
mechanisms
exist
to
compute
the
exact
probabilities
or
the
approximate probabilities for very complex systems. The inference
algorithms are used to integrate new information in the model as soft
or hard evidence. This information modeled as new observations on
some variable states is a way to compute the impacts of situations on
target variables. In maintenance or risk management, it is interesting to
integrate speciﬁc situations or compute the impacts of some scenarios
or maintenance actions. In all inference mechanisms, Bayes theorem is
used to propagate the probabilities on the variables and to update the
probabilities of all the variables given the observations of states or
likelihoods of states.
In computer science, current research focuses mainly on inference
efﬁciency to handle increasingly complex models and to increase the

8

number of variables handled. For the exact inference, efﬁcient
algorithms use the BN structure to solve the non-deterministic
polynomial-time-hard (NP-hard) problem to compute an a posteriori
probability distribution of random variables [PEA 88, PEO 91, JEN 90,
SHA 96, MAD 99, FAY 00, ALL 03]. The best known algorithms are
based on the junction tree. For a detailed explanation, refer to [JEN 96,
pp.76]. The newest algorithms attempt to reduce the memory
requirements and to increase the computing speed to deal with larger
models [JAE 02, WUI 12]. In dependability analyses, these abilities
help model industrial-scale systems.
1.2. Reliability and joint probability distributions
BN are often of interest in the modeling of the dependability of
systems. They allow a factorized model of the dependencies between
the component states and the system states.
1.2.1. Multi-state system example
For a better understanding of BN applied to dependability modeling
problems, let us analyze the multi-state system in Figure 1.2. This
system contains three valves (V1, V2 and V3). Its goal is to distribute a
ﬂuid. In this system, the components each have three states: a
functioning state Ok and two disjoint failure states, i.e. remains closed
Rc and remains open Ro [WEB 03]. Discrete variables (x1, x2 and x3)
model the states of the valves (V1, V2 and V3). The probability of each
of the states is given for each variable in Table 1.2.

Table 1.2. Probability distributions of component states
1.2.2. Joint distribution
For
any
system,
a
probability
is
deﬁned
for
each
state
corresponding to the Cartesian product between the states of each
component and the system states to deﬁne the joint probability
[SHA 96, p. 2]. The advantage of this representation is to show all the
possible situations (working or failure). The main drawback is the size
of the Cartesian product that increases rapidly and becomes excessive
for the analyst, particularly in industrial-scale systems.
Tables 1.3 and 1.4 provide the application of the multi-state system
with three valves. The joint probability is deﬁned by P(y, x1, x2, x3),
where y represents the system states and xi represents the states of the
components in the three-valve system. If the system is functioning, then
y = Ok, otherwise y = Hs.
1.2.3. Reliability computing
The system reliability depends on the components’ reliability (x1,
x2 and x3) and the relation between the system reliability, y, and the
component states. This relation is the structure function. The joint
probability distribution P(y, x1, x2, x3) can be computed on any
structure function. In the case of the three-valve system, the reliability
can be computed from the joint probability distribution. The reliability
is then given by marginalization P(y = Ok) = 0.345721859, which is
the sum of all state combinations, where the system state is Ok. Note
that it is possible to compute all conditional probabilities from the joint
probability distribution.

Equation [1.1] is the factorized form of the joint probability
distribution P(y, x1, x2, x3). The conditional probability distribution
P(y|x1, x2, x3),
which
is
deterministic,
remains
unwieldy.
Nevertheless, the conditional probability distribution may be factorized
again by introducing intermediate variables, as done in fault trees. For
instance, the system can be divided into two stages, as shown in
Figure 1.3. Two variables E1 and E2 are introduced that characterize
the states of the system stage. E1 characterizes the possibility of
controlling the ﬂow in stage 1 and E2 in stage 2.
Figure 1.3. Multi-state three-valve system with two stages
To maintain all the information about the states, E1 and E2 are
deﬁned in three states:
– Ok, if it is possible to open or close the stage;
– if the stage failed and is stuck in the closed state and stops the ﬂow;
– Ro, if the stage failed and is stuck in the open state and allows the
ﬂow.
Thus, equation [1.1] becomes:
P(y, x1, x2, x3) = P(x1).P(x2).P(x3).P(E1|x1).
P(E2|x2, x3).P(y|E1, E2)
[1.2]
The probability distributions of the component states given in
Table 1.2 are considered to be independent. They can be deﬁned,

thanks to the component lifetime or the end of mission, and estimated
according to their reliability law (exponential, Weibull, etc.) or given
by an expert.
The factorization of independent variables in the model helps
simplify the model by a set of conditional probabilities whose size is
considerably smaller than that of the joint probability. The conditional
probability distributions are given in Tables 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7. Therefore,
the BN is a graphical representation of this factorization of joint
probability. By adding the graphical representation, the BN gives an
easily interpretable model (Figure 1.1). The exact inference algorithms
compute the marginal probability of all requested variables, for
instance the probability distribution of y:

It should be noted that the probability distribution obtained by the
BN model is the same as that obtained from the joint probability, such
as P(y = Ok).
1.3. Discussion and conclusion
The tables that deﬁne the conditional probabilities model the
structure function of the system. This structure function is an equation
that describes the relation between the component states and the
system states. If the structure function is constant, then it implies that
the conditional probability distribution is time independent. Deﬁning
the conditional probability using a table allows the modeling of any
relations between the system states and the component states. If the
relation is based on Boolean operation (AND, OR, etc.), then the CPT
is deterministic, but more complex relations can be modeled. The
reliability of the system is well modeled if the structure function is
correctly modeled by the BN and if all scenarios are described. A CPT
contains all the knowledge about the relation between the input states
and the output states requested by the analysis.
In the classical case of binary state hypothesis, i.e. the system and
its components can have two states {Ok, Hs}, the structure function is
similar to a Boolean function. The CPT translates this Boolean
relation. In this case, there is an exact correspondence between the BN
model and a RBD when considering the working case or a fault tree

A Modeling Formalism for System Dependability
15
when considering the failure case. Note that for our illustration, a
non-binary function with three state components is deliberately
chosen, to go beyond usual cases with RBD and fault tree and to
exhibit part of the advantages of the BN model.
In our illustration as in all binary cases, there is no uncertainty
between the combination of component states and system states. The
probabilities of P(y|x1, x2, x3) are equal to 0 or 1. Therefore, CPT is
deterministic. Note that this is not necessarily the case, for example, in
a non-deterministic model, P(y|x1, x2, x3) ∈[0, 1]. This case models
some situations where there is an uncertainty about the consequence of
a component state combination, an uncertain function due to a human
factor, an uncertain context, etc.
In this chapter, some of the main advantages of BN techniques have
been discussed in an academic and industrial context. It is not necessary
to know the joint probability of the system to ﬁnd the BN model. The
analyst can build the model gradually, but he should conduct his analysis
with a semantic guide.

Bayesian Network: Modeling
Formalism of the Structure
Function of Boolean Systems
2.1. Introduction
One of the principle characteristics of modeling Boolean stucture
function using BN is the ability to construct models from knowledge
without
technical
expertise
regarding
computing
algorithms.
Nevertheless, this advantage can be a source of doubt about the
computing results obtained from BN models. Formally, the numerical
results are exact and the question of validity should concern only the
quality of the model built by the analyst and/or the representativeness
of data used to learn the parameters. Therefore, it is very important to
use a structured modeling approach to obtain a model that better
corresponds to reality.
From a practical point of view, there is often a lack of data to
inform models in reliability estimation, risk analysis and maintenance
optimization. It is often impossible to fully deﬁne the joint distribution
deﬁning all situations and their associated probabilities. As a result,
modeling tools require the use of expert judgments to build structured
models [CEL 06]. The BN modeling practiced in this book is presented
in this spirit.

Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
BN is a powerful modeling tool as it can combine knowledge of
different kinds. This combination is allowed by the probabilistic
representation and the combination of state of affairs. The model
structure as well as the estimation of the model parameters can be built
either
automatically
or
manually
from:
data
from
feedback
experiences; expert judgments based mainly on logical rules (not
necessarily Boolean logic); equations; and databases of the system
states or observations. By using objective or subjective probabilities, a
BN can formalize causal relations or dependences/independences
between variables. For instance, BN can model the effect of
maintenance actions carried out by humans on a technical system (see
[MED 11]) as well as the effect of defense barriers on risk analysis (see
[LÉG 09]).
As previously discussed, BN are well-suited to modeling the
structure function of system reliability. This modeling approach is
based mainly on statistical knowledge and uses a combination of data
and knowledge of qualitative causal relations to describe conditional
dependencies between variables. The structure function is used in
dependability analysis to model the propagation of failure events,
degradation and alteration of the system [VIL 88, COC 97, COR 75,
GER 00]. BN clearly helps in understanding the system behavior,
thanks to the inference algorithm that propagates the observations
(evidence) of the system and its components.
It is important to understand that more than one BN can model the
same structure function. It depends on the way the factorization is done,
exactly as with FT or RBD. The BN model structure will be different
but the results are exactly the same because the same joint distribution
is modeled.
Therefore, the PGM can be built by enumerating the (minimal)
cut-sets and (minimal) tie-sets or based on the knowledge of system
function. For the latter, a functional analysis like IDEF0 completed by
dysfunctional analysis (FMEA or HAZOP) can help deﬁne the BN as
mentioned in [WEB 06]. This approach reduces the tremendous task of
enumerating cut-sets or tie-sets. To go beyond the BN, another way to
build the model is to use the concept of object-oriented modeling with
small bricks of knowledge. The reader can refer to SKOOB [ANR 11],

a project funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR); an
illustration of this methodology is described in [MED 11].
For an illustration of BN applied to dependability analysis, the
following sections show the different BN models and their equivalence
with usual models.
2.2. BN models in the Boolean case
Let us consider the binary state hypothesis. The BN model can be
compared with FT, RBD, cut-sets and tie-sets. In this section, the risk
analysis bowtie model is also introduced and a BN representation is
given. This model has been used successfully in industrial applications
[LÉG 09, FAL 12].
Figure 2.1. RBD of the ﬂow distribution system
For the sake of illustration, this section focuses on the ﬂow
distribution system: the three-valve system, given in Chapter 1 in
Figure 1.2. The RBD of this system is illustrated in Figure 2.1. The
mission of the system is to distribute the ﬂow. Contrary to Chapter 1,
the binary state hypothesis is made. Thus, the components have two
states: xi = 0 if the valve i is working and allows the ﬂow to go
through the valve; and xi = 1 if the valve i does not allow the ﬂow to
go through the valve – the valve is then considered broken. The
probability distributions of xi are given in Table 2.1. The system is
modeled by the variable y: y = 0 if the system accomplishes its
mission; and y = 1 if the system is unable to accomplish its mission.

The cut-sets represent the malfunction scenarios of the system.
Based on the RBD illustrated in Figure 2.1, three cut-sets can be
isolated:
C1 = {x1}
C2 = {x2, x3}
[2.1]
C3 = {x1, x2, x3}
The system works if no cut-set occurs or conversely the system fails
if at least one of the cut-sets occurs. This property is due to the Boolean
nature of the components. The BN model of reliability based on these
three cut-sets is shown in Figure 2.2.

Table 2.3. CPT of y based on cut-sets
The dependability engineer knows that it is efﬁcient to compute the
reliability directly with minimal cut-sets, i.e. cut-sets that do not
include other cut-sets. Thus, equation [2.2] becomes equation [2.3] and
consequently the BN model is reduced, as shown in Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.3. BN model of two minimal cut-sets
With BN, the two models give exactly the same correct results,
whereas the ﬁrst has one more cut-set. C3 is, in fact, the combination
of the two other cut-sets. When or C2 occurs then C3 occurs. With BN,
the dependencies between cut-sets are taken into account during the
inference and, hence, the results are correct. This is the strength of BN
and their inference algorithms. Conditional dependencies are taken into
account by inference algorithms to compute the exact results. Thus, the
difference is in the computational cost, which is optimal when the
model is based on minimal cut-sets.

Modeling Formalism of the Structure Function of Boolean Systems

2.2.2. BN model from tie-sets
Let us consider the problem from the point of view of success. Three
tie-sets can be extracted from Figure 2.1, as given by equation [2.3].
The BN model (Figure 2.4) is given by:
L1 = {x1, x2}
L2 = {x1, x3}
[2.4]
L3 = {x1, x2, x3}
The reader can note directly that none of the tie-sets are minimal
because L1 ∪L2 = L3. Nevertheless, as in the case of cut-sets, the
inference mechanism will work properly and give the correct result.
Let us consider the two minimal tie-sets L1 and L2, for computing the
probability distribution of the system states. The deterministic CPT of
tie-set L1, according to the states of x1 and x2, are given in Table 2.4.
The CPT for L2 is given in Table 2.5. The combination of the two

The logical behavior of the system failures induces deterministic
CPT, which are equivalent to Boolean gates. The BN are modeling
Boolean equations by probabilities equal to 0 or 1.

2.2.3. BN model from a top-down approach
In the case of large systems, the enumeration of all functioning or
dysfunctioning scenarios is cumbersome. To solve this problem, the FT
modeling is based on a descending approach. Starting from a top event
that characterizes the undesired event, the analysis goes down the tree by
the deﬁnition of intermediate events identiﬁed as direct causes of upper
events, until elementary events are obtained. For example, Figure 2.5
shows the FT of the ﬂow distribution system, which is obviously quite
simple.

If a FT is available, it is very simple to translate it into a BN by
simple
mapping.
As
shown
earlier
for
tie-sets
and
cut-sets,
deterministic CPT can map Boolean relations between variables with
logical operators: AND and OR. Figure 2.6 shows the mapping result
of the FT shown in Figure 2.5 into a BN. For each event in the FT, a
variable is deﬁned in the BN.
For instance, the AND gate in Figure 2.5 is such that E2 = x2 ∧x3,
i.e. E2 occurs if x2 = 1 and x3 = 1. The CPT of the BN is given in

Table 2.8. The OR gate in Figure 2.5 is such that y = x1∨E2, i.e. y = 1
for the failure of the system if x1 = 1 or E2 = 1. The CPT of the BN is
deﬁned in Table 2.9.
Figure 2.6. BN model of the FT of Figure 2.5
By the inference mechanism, the BN computes the probability

quite easy to model a FT by an equivalent BN, an ET is modeled by an
equivalent BN. Therefore, a BN model of a bowtie model can be
obtained easily, as shown in Figure 2.7. Usually, in risk analysis, the
goal is to place and assess barriers to prevent or protect from the
undesired event. This modeling technique has been applied in several
industrial cases [LÉG 09, DUV 12, KHA 13]. In Figure 2.7, variables
E2 and Ip1 model the impact of barriers B1 and B2 on the propagation
of the malfunctioning of the system deﬁned by y = 1.

Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
Bi represent the efﬁciency of the barriers. Bi = 0 represents an
efﬁcient barrier that stops all the propagation of an undesired event.
The CPT of the variable in the bowtie is given in Table 2.10. The
relation between E2, x2 and x3 is given by the FT in Figure 2.5 and
CPT Table 2.8. The variable B1 represents the inhibitor effect of the
barrier. If B1 = 0, the barrier stops the event propagation and E2 = 0.
If B1 = 1 the barrier is not efﬁcient, and the propagation is made as in
the FT by the equation E2 = x2 ∧x3 exactly as without the barrier.
The CPT of Ip1 inhibited by B2 is given in Table 2.11.
The model of barrier efﬁciency can be formalized as a graph
combining all the factors of efﬁciency losses as a BN structure
perpendicular to the bowtie and mapping on the FT as proposed in
[LÉG 09, FAL 12]. [LÉG 09, FAL 12] have also deﬁned the way to
estimate the barrier efﬁciency from expert elicitations, taking into
account human, organizational and environmental factors.

2.3. Standard Boolean gates CPT
All Boolean gates can be modeled by a BN (OR, AND, Koon,
Exclusive OR, etc.). It is sufﬁcient to directly map the Boolean
equation inside the CPT [SIM 07, SIM 08].
An n-component system that functions (or works) if and only if at
least k of the n components work is called a k-out-of-n:G system. An n-
component system that fails if and only if at least k of the n components
fail is called a k-out-of-n:F system. Both parallel and series systems are
special cases of the k-out-of-n system. A series system is equivalent to a
1-out-of-n:F system and an n-out-of-n:G system, while a parallel system
is equivalent to an n-out-of-n:F system and a 1-out-of-n:G system.
Let us deﬁne the CPT of a 2-out-of-3:G system, with the components
x1, x2 and x3. The BN structure is shown in Figure 2.8. The system is
functioning, y = 0, if at least two components are available; xi = 0
and xj = 0, with i ̸= j and i, j ∈{1, 2, 3}. The CPT of y is deﬁned in
Table 2.12.
Figure 2.8. BN model of the 2-out-of-3:G system
Unlike FT or RBD, BN can integrate topological constraints, for
instance the linear or circular consecutive-koon system. Such systems
cannot be modeled by FT or RBD because of the independence

hypothesis of events. The BN solves this problem by computing
conditional independence and gives a systematic modeling method

Table 2.12. CPT of a Boolean 2-out-of-3:G system
Consecutive-koon systems have attracted considerable attention
since they were ﬁrst proposed by Kontoleon in 1980 [KON 80]. A
consecutive-koon system can be classiﬁed according to the linear or
circular arrangement of its components and the functioning or
malfunctioning principle. Thus, four types of k-out-of-n can be
enumerated: linear consecutive-koon:F, linear consecutive-koon:G,
circular
consecutive-koon:F
and
circular
consecutive-koon:G.
A
consecutive-koon:F system consists of a set of n ordered components
that compose a chain such that the system fails if at least k consecutive
components fail. A consecutive koon:G system is a chain of n
components such that the system works if at least k consecutive
components work. An illustration of these speciﬁc structures can be
found in telecommunication systems with n relay stations that can be
modeled
as
a
linear
consecutive-koon:G
system
if
the
signal
transmitted from each station is strong enough to reach the next k
stations. An oil pipeline system for transporting oil from point to point
with n spaced pump stations is another example of a linear-
consecutive-koon system. A closed recurring water supply system with
n water pumps in a thermo-electric plant is a good example of a
circular system. The system ensures its mission if each pump is
powerful enough to pump water and steam to the next k consecutive
pumps [YAM 03].

Let us deﬁne the BN model of a linear consecutive-2-out-of-5:G
system and a circular consecutive-2-out-of-5:G system with the
components x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5. The BN structures are given in
Figure 2.9 and Figure 2.10. The system is functioning, y = 0, if at least
two consecutive components are available, xi = 0 and xi+1 = 0, with
i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The factorization given by the variable Ci, based on
AND gates, allows us to simplify the CPT of y, which is then only
based on an OR gate. The CPT of the Ci is deﬁned in Table 2.13 and
the table of y is given in Table 2.14 for the linear consecutive-
2-out-of-5:G system and in Table 2.15 for the circular consecutive-
2-out-of-5:G system.

The binary state hypothesis is usually made while dealing with
reliability or dependability analysis, as done in previous sections.
Then, Boolean logic (OR, AND, XOR, NOT, etc.) deﬁnes the failure
scenarios that lead to the undesired event as described by FT or
equivalent representations. There is also the possibility of translating

algebraic relations. In these situations, BN include deterministic CPT,
i.e. conditional probabilities only in 0, 1.

Nevertheless, BN models are able to consider non-deterministic
CPT. Non-deterministic CPT is deﬁned by conditional probabilities in
]0, 1[. It means that the occurrence of a cause cannot produce the
consequence at all. If the CPT is built by the database, then the
non-deterministic CPT arrives when the occurrences of some parent
states do not produce the same occurrence of the child state. When the
CPT is built by an analyst, the non-deterministic CPT translates the
analyst’s inability to deﬁne a strict logical relation between the parents
and the considered variable. The problem occurs if the expert is unsure

inﬂuence the variable considered.

When the CPT is deﬁned from a large dataset, a learning algorithm
solves the problem easily. Three principal algorithms exist: counting
[HEC 96, KRA 98], expectation-maximization [LAU 95] and gradient
descent [BIN 97]. The previous case considers a general case where
all conditional probabilities are estimated in the interval [0, 1]. The
problem of learning CPT arises when there is a small dataset [ONI 01].
This case is usually too incommodious to be deﬁned by an expert. If
there is a known relation between parents and the variable considered,
this relation may simplify the expert’s work. Henrion [HEN 89] talks
about independence of the causal inﬂuence (ICI) models based on the
assumption of ICI of the parents. This assumption leads to the number
of parameters needed to build the CPT, proportional to the number of
parents. A further distinction is made between:
– noisy ICI models;
– leaky ICI models (i.e. an extension of the formers);
– probabilistic ICI.

Modeling Formalism of the Structure Function of Boolean Systems
35
The Noisy-OR structure was introduced by Pearl [PEA 88] to
reduce the elicitation effort in building the BN probabilistic model that
combines probability and logic. This structure is an extension of the
OR structure. Let us consider a binary variable y with its binary parent
variables xi (Figure 2.11). Variables y and xi can be either true 1 or
false 0. XT is deﬁned as the set of xi that are true and XF is deﬁned as
the set of xi that are false. The Pearl’s idea is to associate with each xi
a “link probability” pi such that 0 ≤pi ≤1. This probability pi
corresponds to the probability that y is true if xi is true. It illustrates
the fact that the causal dependency between xi and y can be inhibited
(or imperfect). This link probability pi is deﬁned as follows:
pi = P(y = {1}|xi = {1}, Xj,j̸=i = {0})
[2.5]
With this proposal, only n parameters are sufﬁcient to completely
deﬁne the CPT of y. Then, it is easy to deﬁne the probability that y
is true given xi and the probability that y is false given xi with the
following relations:
P(y = 1|xi) = 1 −

xi∈XT
(1 −pi)
[2.6]
P(y = 0|xi) =

xi∈XT

[2.7]

36
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
The Noisy-OR (N-OR) structure implies that y
=
0 with a
probability equal to 1 if all its parent variables xi = 0. However, in
many cases this is an unrealistic assumption. It is difﬁcult to capture all
the causes of y in several situations (e.g. for reliability to deﬁne all the
failure modes of a component). Therefore, Henrion [HEN 89]
proposed an extension of the N-OR structure called Leaky Noisy-OR
(LN-OR) by introducing a new parameter called “leak probability”.
The leak probability corresponds to other unknown parents that may
affect y. These parents are modeled by using the variable L with a link
probability pi = l (Figure 2.12). Let l be the leak probability, such that
0 ≤l ≤1, which is deﬁned as follows:
l = P(y = 1|xi = 0, ∀i = 1..n)
[2.8]
Figure 2.12. Leaky Noisy-OR structures
Henrion [HEN 89] proposed the following parameterization of the
LN-OR structure with n + 1 parameters:
P(y = 1|xi) = 1 −(1 −l) ×

xi∈XT
(1 −pi
1 −l )
[2.9]
P(y = 0|xi) = (1 −l) ×

xi∈XT
(1 −pi
1 −l )
[2.10]

Modeling Formalism of the Structure Function of Boolean Systems
37
Diez [DIE 93] gave another parameterization of the LN-OR structure
as follows:
P(y = 1|xi) = 1 −(1 −l) ×

xi∈XT
(1 −pi)
[2.11]
P(y = 0|xi) = (1 −l) ×

xi∈XT
(1 −pi)
[2.12]
These two parameterizations are mathematically equivalent, but the
difference is related to the question the experts are asked to elicit
knowledge. Henrion’s parameterization led to the following question:
“What is the probability that y is true given that xi is true and all other
modeled variables are false?” Diez’s parameterization is supported by
the following question: “What is the probability that y is true given that
xi is true and all other modeled and non-modeled variables are false?”
In Henrion’s parameterization, experts have to consider a combined
inﬂuence of xi and the leak on y. In Diez’s parameterization, experts
have to consider the link between xi and y with the leak being absent.
The parameters deﬁned earlier can be uncertain too. For example,
the inﬂuence of a parent variable on a child variable, but also the
number of non-modeled parent variables or the state of parent variables
cannot be well known. In risk analyses, experts often use intervals to
assess different variables. For example, intervals can be used to assess
the state of a parent variable or the inﬂuence of a parent variable on the
child variable. It is, therefore, necessary to take into account
uncertainties relating to the link probabilities, the leak probability and
the state of parent variables xi. Scientiﬁc contributions already exist in
relation to the problem of uncertainty in logical structures such as
N-OR or LN-OR. Srinivas [SRI 93] and Diez [DIE 93] proposed an
extension of the N-OR structure for non-Boolean variables. Antonucci
[ANT 11] developed an imprecise LN-OR structure with uncertainty
on the link probabilities that can be extended to uncertainty on the leak
probability with Diez’s parameterization.

2.5. Industrial applications
Over the past few years, several modeling approaches have dealt
with a global view of risks, accounting for technical aspects while
being immersed in human, organizational and environmental contexts.
[PAT 96] developed the system–action–management (SAM) approach
and [SVE 02] highlighted the importance of considering different
actors in the risk analysis of an industrial system through a graphical
representation of causal ﬂow of accidents (AcciMap). Moreover,
[PAP 03] developed the I-Risk method that can account for both
technical and organizational characteristics in system risk analysis for
the chemical industry. [PLO 04], with MIRIAM1-ATHOS2, evaluated
major risk management systems examining technical, human and
organizational factors. [CHE 06] focused on the representation of
accidental scenarios via the bowtie formalism to facilitate the
organizational learning process and [MOH 09] proposed a means of
carrying out probabilistic safety studies by taking organizational
factors into account.
A recent method was proposed during an academic/industrial
collaboration by EDF, INERIS (L’Institut National de l’Environnement
Industriel et des Risques) and CRAN (Research Center for Automatic
Control of Nancy) [LÉG 09]. This method is called integrated risk
analysis. It focuses on a uniﬁed risk modeling. The model is
multidisciplinary and generic. The generic property comes from a
bowtie node for the technical parts, which serves as a basis from
which to integrate knowledge about the human, organizational and
environmental contexts through the barriers’ efﬁciency that mitigate
the inﬂuences of basic events on the consequences of accidental
situations.
This modeling methodology has been applied to the assessment of
risks in an industrial power plant and, more precisely, to the assessment
of technical, human and organizational mitigation actions [LÉG 08a].
The uniﬁed model is structured based on the organizational level, the
human actions level and their impacts (inhibition) on the propagation
of causes and consequences into the bowtie model [LÉG 08a, LÉG 08,

Modeling Formalism of the Structure Function of Boolean Systems
39
LÉG 08b]. The model structure is given in Figure 2.13. The model
obtained is used to estimate the occurrence probability of some risk
scenarios and to assess the efﬁciency of barriers on risk reduction. In
the risk management process [IEC 09], an engineer can use the model
to identify the weaknesses of the socio-technical system and act
accordingly to keep the risk criticality below an acceptable level. For
the computation part, the model is based on a BN because it combines
knowledge and observations to simulate scenarios and to identify
weaknesses.
The reader can ﬁnd an application of this BN-based modeling
methodology on a chemical process in [LÉG 09]. In this application,
80 variables are considered. In [DUV 12], a critical system of a power
plant is modeled with approximately 110 variables. This latter model is
presented in Figure 2.14. The large number of variables in such a
model means that only specialists are qualiﬁed to understand and
perform simulations to characterize risks.

2.6. Conclusion
This chapter illustrates how BN can solve the modeling problems
of dependability and risk analysis of complex systems. This formalism
works well with usual Boolean approaches such as FT or RBD. The
construction of BN models in such cases follows the same guidelines
and gives the same results.
The construction can be automatic by enumerating the cut-sets or tie-
sets whether minimal or not. Moreover, BN is well suited to modeling
complex systems where dependencies between variables are not only
deterministic.
Several BN structures are feasible for system dependability
modeling. Model validation rests on the validation of the method used
to build the model and confrontating the model with experiences by
testing scenarios to validate the coherence of the model with
well-known real cases.
Although BN provides a very compact model of large and complex
problems, and makes it possible to handle hundreds of variables, some
thousands of variables are needed for large industrial systems. In this
case, the BN reach their limits. When the number of variables becomes
too large, i.e. if the model cannot be supported in the memory of the
computer that handles it, it is then necessary to use a more suitable
modeling formalism.

Bayesian Network: Modeling
Formalism of the Structure
Function of Multi-State Systems
3.1. Introduction
In the case of multi-state systems, standard dependability methods,
proposed in the literature are difﬁcult to implement [LIS 03]. In this
section, the methodology previously presented in the Boolean case is
transposed to multi-state systems to prove that it is easy to obtain
multi-state
models
with
BN.
Methods
are
presented
for
the
construction of a model of multi-state systems. The methods are based
on cut-sets, tie-sets or the principle of top-down analysis based
on functional analysis. Section 3.2.3 explains the functional analysis-
based method and explains how it provides an easy way to build an
efﬁcient model.
3.2. BN models in the multi-state case
The ﬁrst step when modeling a multi-state model for dependability
analysis is to deﬁne the set of variables xi that represent the component
states [SHU 10] as follows:
Benefits of Bayesian Network Models, First Edition. Philippe Weber and Christophe Simon. 
© ISTE Ltd 2016. Published by ISTE Ltd and John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
xi = 0 if the component i is in normal working state;
xi = 1 . . . (li −1) if the component i is in a degraded state; [3.1]
xi = li . . . ni if the component i is in a failure state.
with li being the ﬁrst failure state, i.e. the component does not satisfy its
functioning goals. States 1 . . . (li −1) are degraded functioning states,
i.e. the component is not fully functional but it does not compromise
the system mission. States li . . . ni are several failure states of the
component that can have different consequences on the system state.
The system state is also deﬁned by a multi-state variable with respect
to different functioning and malfunctioning scenarios. This variable is
denoted as y and takes its values in the following states:
y = 0 corresponds to the well-functioning state;
y = 1 . . . (l −1) correspond to degraded states;
[3.2]
y = l . . . n correspond to malfunctioning states.
Regarding the complexity of scenarios in a multi-state system, it is
difﬁcult or impossible to model the system dysfunction using a FT or
the functioning of the system by using a RBD. The analysis based on
minimal cut-sets or minimal tie-sets remains efﬁcient, and this method
provides the deﬁnition of all the scenarios. The BN is an efﬁcient
modeling method by which to represent these scenarios. The purpose is
to model the state of the system as a function of the components’ states
by the multi-state function φ. This function can be written as y = φ(x),
where vector x = (x1, x2, . . . , xr).
3.2.1. BN model of multi-state systems from tie-sets
The multi-state structure function is easily modeled by a BN.
The variables mainly represent the components, the system and

Modeling Formalism of the Structure Function of Multi-State Systems
45
the scenarios. The second step is to structure the BN to efﬁciently link
the component variables to the system variable, to encode the
functioning and the failure scenarios of the system.
A ﬁrst solution consists of enumerating all the minimal tie-sets or
minimal cut-sets. By applying the same approach as in the binary case,
a BN is deﬁned to represent the conditional dependencies linking the
system functioning or the failure states of the system with the minimal
cut-sets or the minimal tie-sets. For the system shown in Figure 1.2,
seven functioning scenarios exist: one is the perfect functioning state
and the others are degraded functioning scenarios. In this modeling
problem, the degraded states of the system are not modeled; therefore,
the system state is deﬁned only by two states: when the system is
functioning y = 0; and y = 1 otherwise. The minimal tie-sets are
deﬁned from the following combination of components’ states: 0
corresponds to Ok, 1 corresponds to Rc, and 2 corresponds to Ro as
deﬁned previously in Table 1.2 of Chapter 1:
L1 = {x1 = 0, x2 = 0}
L2 = {x1 = 0, x3 = 0}
L3 = {x1 = 0, x2 = 2}
L4 = {x1 = 0, x3 = 2}
[3.3]
L5 = {x1 = 2, x2 = 0, x3 = 0}
L6 = {x1 = 2, x2 = 1, x3 = 0}
L7 = {x1 = 2, x2 = 0, x3 = 1}
Tie-set Lj is said to have occurred (been realized) if the components
are in the states that deﬁne the tie-set. The occurrence of a tie-set has
deﬁned by (Lj = 0). If at least one of the tie-sets is occurred, then the
system is in the functioning state y = 0. The BN structure is obtained
by linking each of the tie-sets Lj to the variables characterizing the
components’ states xi involved in each tie-set (see Figure 3.1).
This approach automatically gives a BN, but the model obtained is
not compact and, hence, is difﬁcult to understand. To render the BN

46
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
more compact, it is pertinent to combine nodes representing minimal
tie-sets to the same variables such as {L1, L3}, {L2, L4} and
{L5, L6, L7} by creating complex variables and using the full
capability of CPT based on multi-state logical combinations.
Figure 3.1. BN structured by the minimal multi-state tie-sets
For {L1, L3}, L13 = L1 ∪L3 is deﬁned. L13 = 0 for the two
scenarios: L1 = {x1 = 0, x2 = 0} and L3 = {x1 = 0, x2 = 2}. In all
other cases, L13 = 1 (see Table 3.1). For L24, the CPT is deﬁned in the
same manner and is the same as for L13 (see Table 3.2). Finally, for

structure is given in Figure 3.2.

Table 3.9. Results of the computation based on multi-state and cut-sets
As shown in previous sections, a BN model can easily be built from
the tie-sets or minimal cut-sets for any type of system: simple, complex,
binary or multi-state. The models shown in Figures 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3
are equivalent, even if they do not exhibit the same variables. They are
equivalent because they model the same joint probability distribution
(y, x1, x2, x3) with different factorizations.
As discussed previously, an automatic construction can be realized.
Nevertheless, the models obtained are of large dimension and have no
explicit structure. This structure of three layers with components,
cut-sets or tie-sets and system missions is not of high interpretability,
particularly for industrial systems.

3.2.3. BN model of multi-state systems from functional and
dysfunctional analysis
A functional/dysfunctional approach can be used to build a
BN without enumerating all functional/dysfunctional scenarios. A
functional analysis like IDEF0 associated with a dysfunctional
analysis, as proposed in [WEB 01, MUL 04, WEB 06, MED 13,
MED 15], can serve to build a more readable structure. This approach
is also well suited for multi-state systems.
Functional analysis of a system deﬁnes a model structure based on
the functions achieved by the system. This analysis is interesting
because it provides a model structure according to the levels of
abstraction describing the functional architecture. Moreover, the
system is not limited to the technical system, but can also include
human or organizational levels [MED 11].
A function is achieved in a system if its environment provides the
necessary input ﬂows: operating conditions, operating supports, energy,
orders, etc. Several input ﬂows may contribute to the achievement of a
function and the output ﬂows represent the results of the function; thus,
the pattern of a generic function is shown in Figure 3.4.
Figure 3.4. Generic deﬁnition of a function and its ﬂows
Each part of the BN model corresponds to the functions deﬁned by
the functional analysis. Variables in the BN are deﬁned for each input

53
and output of each function. A generic BN pattern is deﬁned in
Figure 3.5 to model functions.
Figure 3.5. Generic BN pattern of a function
BN variables are multi-state and each of the conditional probability
tables deﬁnes the dependency relationships between variables (not
necessarily deterministic CPT). HAZOP and FMEA analysis speciﬁes
varying states as the failure modes (operating states, degraded states
and failure modes), and these states represent the output ﬂows of the
function.

The modeling method is applied to the system shown in Figure 1.2.
The functional analysis is given in Figures 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. From
functional modeling, the variables x1, x2 and x3 are deﬁned to model
the ﬂows F (V1), F (V2) and F (V3), representing the states of the
components of the system. The variable y is deﬁned to model the ﬂow
F (water transferred) and represents the ﬁnality of the system (main
function). A variable is deﬁned for each function (Table 3.10) that
models the output ﬂow depending on the input ﬂows of the functions.

Figure 3.10. BN model mapped from the
functional model of the system
The BN structure shown in Figure 3.10 is deduced from
the ﬂows deﬁned in the functional analysis. For instance, functional
analysis deﬁnes “circulate the ﬂuid 2” function (Figure 3.8), and the
output ﬂow F (L2) is represented by the variable L2 in the BN
(Figure 3.10). Input ﬂows of this function are F (L1) and F (V2) (for
simplicity, F (control) is not modeled in this example); therefore, in the
BN, the parents of variable L2 are variables L1 and x2 that model the
ﬂows F (L1) and F (V2). The BN model is deﬁned by connecting all
the variables representing the input and output ﬂows in the functional
analysis. The resulting model is different from the models built from
minimal cut-sets and minimal tie-sets; this time the model structure is
based on a functional analysis of the system.

The inference in the BN model computes the probability y. The
results are equal to those computed from the cut-sets, the tie-sets or
from the initial joint law. The probabilities of the variables L and I
modeling “circulate the ﬂuid” and “stop the ﬂuid” functions of the
system, are presented in Table 3.11. The variables L1, L2, L3, I1, I2
and I3 are presented in Tables 3.12 and 3.13.

The proposed approach to building the BN structure of the industrial
system is a generalization of the other modeling methods to the multi-
state case. This method is suitable for Boolean models as well as multi-
state models. The method is based on the hierarchical description of
the system functions because the chosen functional analysis provides
the hierarchical description of the system functions; nevertheless, this
principle may be transposed to other functional analyses to avoid this
hypothesis.

3.3. Non-deterministic CPT
For a multi-state system, the relation between the variable y and its
parents xi can be non-deterministic, as mentioned in section 2.4. If the
conditional probabilities deﬁning y are in the 0, 1 interval then the CPT
is deterministic. However, if these conditional probabilities are in the
]0, 1[ interval, then the CPT is non-deterministic. As in the binary case,
this kind of CPT means that the expert is not completely sure that the
occurrence of xi leads to the occurrence of y. Non-deterministic CPT
is encountered for several reasons: the relation between xi and y is
naturally non-determinist or some parents (xi) are missing from the
model. The inability of an expert to deﬁne the relation between xi and
y with complete certainty is translated into a non-deterministic CPT.
Let us illustrate this concept using an industrial example. The
Omega-20 methodology is dedicated to modeling human safety barrier
(HSB) performance. As mentioned in [MIC 09], the assessment of the
performance aims to determine the level of conﬁdence in the barrier.
The probability of efﬁciency of the HSB corresponds to a risk
reduction factor of the critical event propagation. The HSB is Efﬁcient
or Not Efﬁcient; if the HSB is Efﬁcient, the propagation of the critical
event is reduced by 100%, and the occurrence of this accident becomes
equal to 0; if the HSB is Not Efﬁcient, the critical event propagation is
not reduced, and the occurence of the accident is not affected by the
HSB.
Moreover, the HSB is based on three steps: detection, diagnosis and
action. Each of these steps has a performance classiﬁed as follows:
0, 1 or 2. The barrier acts to inhibit the critical event. As shown in
Figure 3.11, the HSBs reduce the probability that an event xA
propagates its effect to the output y. If the detection is inefﬁcient
(conﬁdence level 0), the diagnostic is of low quality and the action has
a high stress level, and the event can propagate fully. If all these steps
are at their best level, the efﬁciency probability is equal to 1 and the
event xA cannot be propagated. When one of the steps is at level 1, it
divides the probability of the critical event propagation by 10, and by

Modeling Formalism of the Structure Function of Multi-State Systems
59
100 at level 2. Then, if detection and diagnostic are at level 1, then the
HSB efﬁciency has a probability equal to 0.01. Therefore, the
efﬁciency probability takes values from 0.000001 to 1, as deﬁned in
Table 3.14.
Figure 3.11. BN model of a human safety barrier (HSB)
This methodology is used in the protection and prevention phases in
a bowtie model. For instance, it has been used in [LÉG 09, DUV 12]
for the integrated risk analysis methodology (Figure 2.14) applied to a
chemical process. According to OMEGA20 methodology, it can easily
be introduced in many technical systems modeled by a bowtie.

maintenance process is fundamental to improving the availability and
productivity of industrial systems. To control these performances,
maintenance managers need to be able to choose a maintenance
strategy and adequate resources to perform this strategy.

Figure 3.12. BN model of the interaction between
maintenance and performance of a food system
It is impossible to formalize such a model as a monolithic set of
interconnected variables. The model structure is based on fusion of the
technical description of the functional view as described in the
previous section and the integration of the human and organizational
layer presented in Léges et al.’s PhD thesis [LÉG 08a, LÉG 09]. The
methodology lies in the uniﬁcation of different types of knowledge
required for the construction of this model [MED 13, MED 15]. In this
application, the BN reaches its limit; therefore, a probabilistic
relational model (PRM) language is used to deﬁne the BN model and a
speciﬁc inference algorithm is used to compute the probabilities in this
very large model.

Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
The model structure is built by the instantiation of several generic
and modular patterns. The patterns are dedicated to modeling the
decision variables for maintenance and the variables of the industrial
system
[MED 11].

these
[MED 11,
MED 13]
describe
an
application of the method to modeling the interaction between
maintenance and performance of a food system. The model is shown in
Figure 3.12 (with 700 variables). The computation is only performed
on a speciﬁc part of the model built partially to answer queries. The
global model is never represented entirely by the inference algorithm.
This modeling methodology results from the ANR SKOOB [ANR 11]
project, and the modeling method is applied in partnership with
SOREDAB on the maintenance of a food system [MED 13, MED 15].
3.5. Conclusion
This chapter illustrates how BN can solve the modeling problems of
dependability and risk analysis of complex systems. This formalism
is well suited to modeling complex multi-state systems where
dependencies between variables are not only deterministic. Modeling
with BN is an efﬁcient and ﬂexible solution for analysis of simple to
complex systems and from binary to multi-state systems.
The modeling methodology based on functional and dysfunctional
analysis proposed in this book coupled with a PRM is a very efﬁcient
modeling method for large systems, as conﬁrmed by the applications
of the ANR SKOOB project [MED 13, MED 15, ANR 11]. Inference
algorithms based on PRM are still being developed [SOM 10,
KN 10, GON 11]; nevertheless, a PRM modeling platform is provided
by Bayesia-BRICKS (Bayesian Representation and Inference for
Complex Knowledge Structuring). The PRM provides a framework for
knowledge
capitalization
by
creating
generic
classes
and
by
instantiation of the model to particular systems. This modeling
formalism is the future of probabilistic graphical models.

Modeling Formalism of the Structure Function of Multi-State Systems

The models presented in this chapter are based on static
representations, they do not take into account the temporal dimension.
In dependability, it is important to model the temporal dimension to
incorporate the impact of the environment, the system operating
conditions, the aging and the degradation of components. Such
modeling allows evaluation of the behavior of the probabilities of
events occurring over time in order to predict future situations. The
objective may be, for example, to anticipate the system degradations.
This temporal dimension is presented in the next chapter.

Operating Constraints in Reliability
Computation
4.1. Introduction
To take into account the uncertainty with the temporal aspect,
system behavior is modeled by a random variable, which takes its
values in ﬁnite states corresponding to the system states. The state
space
method
is
well
known
in
dependability
literature
[COR 75, VIL 88, ANS 94, COC 97, AVE 99, GER 00] and also in
industrial standards [IEC 06]. The models obtained estimate the failure
probabilities of systems throughout their lifetime.
This method gives a graphical representation [VIL 88, p. 303;
COC 97, p. 282] whose complexity depends on the hypotheses made
that correspond to the real stochastic process. However, the complexity
increases tremendously when the number of components increases.
Indeed, the state space describing the system is built from the Cartesian
product of the component states.
To reduce this problem, state aggregation techniques are proposed
[COC 97, p. 282]. The Markov chains (MCs) obtained are usually
compact. For instance, in [WEB 06, WEB 08, POU 09, WEB 12a] it
was applied to wind turbine modeling and gives models with fewer

states than the initial model. A new modeling approach has to satisfy
such a compactness target.
Dynamic fault trees (DFTs) [DUG 92, MES 02] are one solution
allowing us to describe a MC of great dimension. The DFT modeling is
based
on
a
graphical
description
language
of
the
component
combination (for instance, a passive redundancy structure, i.e. “spare
gate”). The MC is generated by compiling the DFT model.
It is now necessary to model increasingly complex relations to
estimate the dynamic behavior of systems. The models aim to estimate
the state probability distributions of the system, taking into account the
component age, the maintenance and control actions, and the context
evolution. A holistic modeling of systems and their interaction with the
context leads us to take into account a huge number of modeling states.
This number of states makes the MC modeling very hard to realize
because of the combinatory explosion of states. The model, even if it
can be made by automaton combination, is very hard to read,
understand, interpret and maintain [DE 92]. DFTs also have their
limitations because they are based on a graphical language with the
binary
state
hypothesis,
and
thus
cannot
conveniently
model
multi-state systems.
In this situation, BN are of interest because they extend the usual
modeling
capacity
of
graphical
modeling
to
handle
complex
multi-state systems. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) are known to
be able to formalize stochastic processes in a compact form [MUR 02].
Thus, they solve the main limits of usual modeling methods. The ﬁrst
research works on the application of DBN to the reliability and system
availability are given in [WEL 00]. In 2002, [WEB 02, WEB 03]
applied DBN to the availability analysis of a system and showed the
ability of a DBN to model a multi-state MC in a compact way. With
this compactness property, a better model can be computed by
reducing the modeling difﬁculty, to address more complex systems.
The goal of this section is to show the application of DBN in the
dependability area and to explain the extension they allow according to
the MC modeling and also their limits.

4.2. Component modeled by a DBN
A DBN can take into account the temporal dimension of the system
states’ evolution along their lifetime by factorizing and discretizing the
state space of each independent random variable at each time instant. A
stochastic process is represented at time k by a variable xk
i with a ﬁnite
number of states (hx
1, . . . hx
n). The state of variables with the same value
of k constitutes the time slice k [HUN 99, BOU 99].
A DBN can model the evolution of discrete random variables by
deﬁning the conditional dependence of a time slice k + 1, given the
states of the random variables at the previous time slice k. The
deﬁnition of the dependence linking the variables at different time
slices
can
model
various
complex
stochastic
processes.
This
time-based stochastic process is modeled by a CPT. Figure 4.1 shows a
particular case where a variable, xk
i , is deﬁned conditionally to itself at
the previous time slide xk−1
i
. This is the Markovian case.
Figure 4.1. DBN model developed over eight time slices
From an observed situation at any time k or from the initial
conditions with k = 0, the inference mechanism in the DBN allows us
to compute the state probability distribution of all variables for each
time slice. To compute this, it is necessary to memorize the state
probability distribution of all the variables in all time slices. The
solution consists of developing the time slices for the entire desired
time horizon, i.e. to duplicate all the variables for each time period.
However, the BN size increases proportionally to the computing

70
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
horizon [KJA 95]. This solution is not convenient for system
dependability analysis because the process should be studied for a
large time horizon. It conducts to a combinatory explosion of variables
that cannot be handled by current inference mechanisms.
4.2.1. DBN model of a MC
In the case of Markovian processes, the Markov property is used to
simplify the inference mechanism. For instance, in a Markovian
process, the CPT is time invariant. The inference can be realized
iteratively without explicitly deﬁning a variable for each time slice.
The DBN model is then compact and only two successive time slices
are modeled, as shown in Figure 4.2. A DBN with two time slices
noted 2-TBN [BOY 98] allows us to deﬁne all the necessary
parameters to model the MC. The ﬁrst slice contains the variables at
the current time step k, while the second allows us to compute the
distribution of variables at the time step (k + 1) by inference. A
variable x(k+1)
i
is deﬁned conditionally to its states in the current time
step x(k)
i
. The CPT, x
(k+1)|x(k)
i
i
, is constant whatever the value of k
(Table 4.1). This CPT is deﬁned from the transition probability matrix
between the states of the MC. With this model, the future states at
(k + 1) are conditionally independent of the past given the present
states at time (k). The CPT clearly shows a MC [KJA 95].
Figure 4.2. DBN of a MC
After the ﬁrst inference, the distribution P

is injected as
the a priori distribution for x(k)
i
. The next inference allows us to
compute the distribution for the next time step. An exact inference
computes the probability distribution of the random variable for the
time step k + 1, from the distribution at time step k. The probability

distribution for the next time steps k + 2, k + 3, . . . are computed by
successive inferences [WEL 00]. For a time horizon of size h, h
inferences are necessary. This computing method is equivalent to the
Chapman–Kolmogorov equation.

4.2.2. DBN model of non-homogeneous MC
The extension to non-homogeneous MC is possible by introducing
time-indexed CPT. By working with the Bayesia company (http://
www.bayesia.com/) this possibility has been introduced in the
BayesiaLab software. The parameters deﬁned in the CPT can be
indexed to an exogenous variable k that represents time.
Here we illustrate the concept. Let us consider valves with three
states: a normal functioning state and two failure states, i.e. a remained
closed state {1} and a remained open state {2}. In the case of varying
parameters, the principle is illustrated by combining two Weibull laws
for the valve x1. The failure rates are time varying and deﬁned according
to Weibull laws with the following parameters:
– for the transition to the remained closed state {1}, the failure rate
is deﬁned as follows:
λ11 = β × k(β−1)
αβ
with β = 3 and α = 500
[4.1]
– for the remained open state, the failure rate is deﬁned as follows:
λ12 = β × k(β−1)
αβ
with β = 2.5 and α = 700
[4.2]
The DBN model of the valve x1 is shown in Figure 4.3. The
probability distribution on the valve states is computed over 1,000

As shown in [WEB 04], a hidden Markov model (HMM) [RAB 89]
can represent the degradation of components. The modeling of
component degradation by HMM has also been used in [MOG 12,
ROB 13, LE 14].
Time is usually considered as a conditional factor in component
reliability, as shown in the previous section. It can be insufﬁcient
[SIN 95]. The conditions of use and the environmental context (like
humidity, temperature, etc.) can alter the component reliability. All
factors that alter component reliability are called co-variables or
exogenous variables [BAG 01]. As described in [COX 55], the
component reliability can be modeled precisely by taking into account
the effects of exogenous variables.
In [WEB 04], several models of MC are deﬁned according to the
operational context of the component. A Markov switching model
(MSM) is introduced to model the switching from one MC to another

models are also considered as conditional MC where the transitions are
conditional to exogenous variables.

The modeling solution by a DBN is really simple [WEB 04]. One or
several exogenous variables modeling the constraints or the operational

model of the component and its environment is formalized as a HMM
conditioned by an input sequence ui(k). This model is called an

the component environment. The impact of the hidden process on the

4.3. Model of a dynamic multi-state system
A DBN is particularly interesting when dealing with several
components in a system. The DBN presented in section 4.2 allows us
to represent several multi-state stochastic processes in a system model.
A multi-state model, as presented in Chapter 3, can easily combine the
models of dynamic multi-state components as presented in section 4.2

76
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
to give a whole model of the dynamic multi-state system. The
computation in a DBN with several stochastic processes is solved by
different inference mechanisms well suited to this problem and to the
conditions of use of the models.
The exact inference algorithms are based on a junction tree [JEN 96].
This mechanism is applied to unroll up models. If all time slices are
deﬁned in the model, then the usual inference algorithm can be used
to compute the exact results (Figure 4.8) but with high computation
costs. The models can be of high complexity with much dependence
between the components (Figure 4.9) and thus are not practical for such
a modeling step. Moreover, they are not adapted for a large time horizon.
Figure 4.8. Unroll up the DBN model without conditional
dependence between components
In the case of a 2TBN, the condition that warrants an exact
computation with a junction tree algorithm is the independence
between the root stochastic processes. This condition is veriﬁed when
all the components are independent as in Figure 4.10. The marginal
distribution is easily computed in a 2TBN by using the exact inference
algorithm. The state probability distribution is computed for each
multi-state component, as shown in Figure 4.11.

For component x1, the process is non-homogeneous:
– failure 1 (valve remained closed) has an occurrence probability
given by equation [4.1];
– failure 2 (valve remained open) has an occurrence probability
given by equation [4.2].
Component x2 is conditionally deﬁned to three functioning modes
by the variable u(k)
2 :
– u(k)

λ21 = 4.10−3 and λ22 = 6.10−3.

Component x3 is modeled by a homogeneous MC with the following
transition probabilities λ31 = 3.10−3 and λ32 = 4.10−3.
Then, the independent components are modeled in the DBN by a
non-homogeneous MC, an IOHMM, and a homogeneous MC. The
DBN models the multi-state system composed of the independent
components in a compact form. The models of the processes are shown
in Figure 4.10. The time slide k + 1 computes the state propagation
from the components to the system y(k), to compute its reliability
(Figure 4.12).

4.4. Discussion on dependent processes
The components of systems are not always independant. To
decrease the model complexity in the case of dependent processes, it is
possible to mix the dependent components in only one stochastic
process that is combined with other independent processes by a
multi-state BN, as shown previously. According to this method, the

80
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
DBN models only independent processes. The whole structure of the
global system is then simpliﬁed, but the number of states of some
variables increases.
Nevertheless
if
some
dependence
exists
between
stochastic
processes, as in the roll up of DBN shown in Figure 4.9, it is necessary
to use a speciﬁc inference algorithm that computes the joint
distribution at each time step with signiﬁcant computing and memory
costs.
The

inference
algorithm
proposed
by
[BOY 98, KOL 99] or particular ﬁltering [KOL 00] can estimate the
marginal distribution with a bounded error, which is often sufﬁcient for
dependability purposes.

Unfortunately,
another

introduces
difﬁculties
in

marginal
distribution
even
in
the
case
of
the
independent structure shown in Figure 4.10. In the analysis of the
functioning scenarios, it is of interest to integrate observations or
evidence like events in the DBN. If evidence about a component is
introduced in the DBN for a state variable x(k)
i
or an exogenous
variable u(k)
i
, the inference is correct until the processes are
independent. However, if evidence is introduced on a variable, for
instance y(k+1)
i
, and this evidence introduces a dependence between
the variables x(k+1)
i
, then a computing problem appears. This
dependence requires the use of speciﬁc algorithms. So, it is necessary
to be cautious when using DBN and evidence to compute the
distributions correctly by considering the right hypothesis.
4.5. Conclusion
In this chapter, DBN are introduced. The chapter shows that DBN
can decrease the effects of combinatory explosion when assessing the
reliability by the factorization of multi-state systems [WEB 03]. DBN
are a representation formalism for MC [WEB 03], HMM and IOHMM.
They
are
well
suited
for
modeling
and
assessing
component
reliabilities [WEB 04, BEN 06]. DBN are also well suited to model
time-varying non-homogeneous MC [WEB 04]. DBN are also able to
model IOHMM by integrating exogenous variables for component
degradation modeling [BEN 06].
In addition, DBN are able to model the wearing out or aging of a
component. It can also integrate the impact of maintenance actions or
the
evolution
of
the
component
operational
conditions.
In
[WEB 06, MUL 04], these kinds of models were applied to the
reliability analysis and prognostic of a system. The DBN model is
based on a multi-state probabilistic model of the system and a dynamic
reliability model of the components.
DBN are also applied to aiding diagnosis [WEB 08]. In this work,
a DBN integrates the reliability models into the probabilistic decision

82
Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
model to diagnose faulty components and to solve possible ambiguity
in their isolation. In [VER 08, VER 09], BN or DBN are used as the
classiﬁer of faults for the diagnostic.
The works done in [BEN 08] address the modeling of temporally
sequenced events. The application concerns the monitoring of the
railway line where structural characteristics are taken into account for
the diagnosis of degradations (i.e. cracks, fragments, random wears
etc.). The problem is solved by an IOHMM that shows the difference
between the normal situation and degradations. It has been applied to
classify singular points of rail defects [BOU 04, BEN 04, SAM 07,
OUK 08].

Dynamic Bayesian Networks:
Integrating Reliability Computation
in the Control System
5.1. Introduction
As discussed in the previous chapters, graphical probabilistic
models are applied in risk management, maintenance and diagnosis.
Nevertheless, these probabilistic models can also be used in control
theory applications. The graphical probabilistic model is implemented
online in the closed loop before interruption of system functioning for
normal or maintenance actions. The purpose of this chapter is to
integrate the probabilistic models into control theory to optimize the
control strategy according to failures and their impacts on system
reliability.
The control strategy has an impact on the system and its
performance during the operation. For instance, modifying a control
law according to the faults and failure can warrant the system
functioning. Nevertheless, overcharging an actuator to compensate for
decreased performance can accelerate the degradation of system
components. From a long-term perspective, performance cannot be
inﬁnitely compensated for. The greater the compensation, the greater

Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
the necessary components’ overcharge and the faster the degradation
rate.
The models necessary to estimate reliability under operational
conditions have to be used online during the operational phase. To do
this, it is necessary to use formalism well suited to the estimation and
prognosis of the functioning modes induced by events occurring
throughout the lifetime of the system. Moreover, control methods are
not designed to integrate probabilistic information coming from
reliability models. Thus, it is necessary to design methods that are able
to integrate the probabilistic knowledge into the control algorithms.
This is an open question and this chapter is dedicated to showing our
approach to this paradigm. Obviously, the proposed approach is based
on DBN presented previously to estimate the fault and failure impact or
context variations on fault-tolerant systems.
5.2. Integrating reliability information into the control
Component reliability and system reliability have been less closely
examined in the literature on control theory. [GOK 05] proposed
integrating the parameters to increase the life of actuators to reduce the
maintenance costs. The method is based on the estimation of time
before
failure
according
to
the
past
component
use
and
the
modiﬁcation of the component’s functioning state if the estimated
remaining lifetime is less than expected. [GOK 06] presented some
algorithms for adaptive control. The ﬁrst algorithm maintains the
expected actuator lifetime by adjusting its performance level. The other
algorithm offers a compromise between the actuator performance and
the expected lifetime according to mission requirements.
[PER 10] proposed a solution based on model predictive control
(MPC) strategy that is used to allocate the effort among the redundant
actuators by ﬁxing constraints on the actuator degradation. This
degradation is computed by cumulating the control inputs. This
constraint is integrated in the MPC strategy to protect against the
dangerous degradation levels of some critical actuators. This method is
not based on reliability computation but integrates the co-variables

Dynamic Bayesian Networks: Control System Computation
85
(control input) that have an impact on the component reliability. The
principle is to focus on increasing the component reliability without
considering the system reliability.
[GUE 07, GUE 11] focused on deﬁning a structure that combines
components to elaborate a system with higher reliability level after a
component failure. It is based on a fault-tolerant control whose
fundamental principle is to keep the performance levels closer to the
performance level deﬁned before the occurrence of failure. Fault
tolerance is a control reconﬁguration or a restructuring strategy
integrating reliability analysis and component costs [GUE 04a,
GUE 04b]. From the fault detection and isolation process, the
reconﬁguration task consists of determining the possible structures
that ensure the initial system performance or accepted degraded
performances by isolating the faulty components or switching to
operating subsystems. For this purpose, an optimal structure is
searched for from among all the possible structures [GUE 04a,
GUE 05, GUE 06].
[KHE 11] proposed a fault-tolerant control strategy to warrant the
system reliability. This new methodology requires adaptation of several
reliability models or parameters to integrate them as constraints or
conditioning criteria of the control law. The integration of the impact
of reliability on the end of mission is a key point of this work.
5.3. Control integrating reliability modeled by DBN
The goal is to deﬁne a control strategy for over-actuated systems
that allows us to optimally allocate the effort on actuators under the
constraint of preserving the system reliability in the normal case or
when component failure occurs. To optimize the actuator inputs, it is
necessary to have sufﬁcient free degrees in the control law. Clearly, this
is the case in over-actuated systems. An over-actuated system is not
necessarily a system with redundant components but a system where
the control goals can be attained in a different manner.

5.3.1. Modeling and controlling an over-actuated system
From a general point of view, an over-actuated system can be
considered as a linear system with m actuators and described by the
following discrete equation:
˜x (k + 1) = A˜x (k) + Bu˜u (k)
˜y (k + 1) = C˜x (k)
[5.1]
with A ∈Rn×n, Bu ∈Rn×m and C ∈Rp×n being the state, control
and output matrices respectively. ˜x ∈Rn is the state vector of the
system, ˜u ∈Rm is the input control vector and ˜y ∈Rp is the system
output vector. The condition rank (Bu) = r < m characterizes
over-actuated systems. Figure 5.1 shows the control principle of an
over-actuated system integrating reliability information. The reliability
model is used to allocate the control efforts on the actuators.
Matrix Bu can be factorized:
Bu = Bv.B

modeled by:

[5.3]
with ˜v (k) ∈Rr representing the whole controlling effort required for
the system to function is also called the virtual input vector. Control
allocation aims to deﬁne the real control inputs of the system ˜u(k) from
the expected virtual control input, such as:
˜vd (k) = B˜u (k)
˜umin ≤˜u ≤˜umax
[5.4]
where ˜vd (k) is computed by an algorithm that should satisfy the control
and target goals and ˜umin ≤˜u ≤˜umax represents the physical limits of
the actuators (saturations).
A solution to the allocation problem is given by the resolution of an
optimization problem. If no solution exists, an optimal solution is
deﬁned with the limits ˜u(k), such that B˜u (k) gives the best
approximation of ˜vd (k). The optimal control input can be obtained by
minimizing the following criteria:

actuators’ reliability into the control input allocation problem of over-
actuated systems. The control problem can be solved in several steps,
as shown in Figure 5.2. To maximize system reliability, the weighing
matrix W(k) is set from the actuator contributions αk

From the control point of view, the over-actuated system is

j = 1. To satisfy the system goals, the actuators to be
used depend on their availability and the structure function ϕ.
The unavailable actuators ek

function, as shown in Figure 5.2, from the Diagnostic function. An
available actuator ek

To integrate the actuators’ reliability in the control strategy, the

state given by the Diagnostic function. Consequently, if an actuator ek

is unavailable, i.e. ek
j = 1, the system can work in the degraded mode

deﬁned by the following probability:
wi (k) = P
	
αk
i = 0|ϕ(ek) = 0, ek
j = 1

[5.11]
The weight wi (k) corresponds to the contribution probability of the
actuator ek
i when the system is working, given the unavailability of
some failed actuators. This probability assessment is not only based on
the actuator’s state of health but also considers the system structure and
the availability of other actuators. By using usual reliability modeling,
assessing this probability is complex or impossible, given the structure
function ϕ. However, this assessment can easily be realized by the
inference mechanism of DBN.
5.4. Application to a drinking water network
The proposed method has been applied to a drinking water network
(DWN) in Barcelona, Spain (Figure 5.3). A DWN is typically an
over-actuated system because several paths can provide water to
customers from various sources. The ﬂow of water on these paths is
controlled by actuators such as valves and pumps. The Barcelona
DWN is supervised by a two-level monitoring system. At the top level,
a control and monitoring system is installed at the control center which
is in charge of the whole network, considering operational constraints
and customer requirements.
A DWN is a ﬂow network that connects sources of water to the
consumers (sink sectors) through pipes. All the DWN parts can fail,
i.e. sources, pipes, tanks, connectors, valves and pumps. Thanks to a
DBN, all these elements’ reliability can be modeled, but the present
work focuses on pumps and valves. The other components are
considered as perfectly reliable and without any saturation.
The method has been applied in simulation with ﬁve sources and one
sink, as shown in Figure 5.3. To satisfy the requested demand for each
day d = yref (k) (C100CFE), at least three sources are required from
among the ﬁve available sources (AportLL1, AportLL2, ApousE12,
ApousE3456, and Aporta).

5.4.2. Results and discussion
A simulation is done over 3,600 hours by using Matlab to apply the
methodology based on control input optimization and DWN reliability
computation. The DBN is based on the Bayes Net Toolbox (BNT), as
proposed by Murphy in 2002 [MUR 02].
The results for a particular simulation are illustrated in Figure 5.5.
The ﬁgure shows the actuator reliability and the DWN reliability. The
actuator reliability follows a decreasing exponential curve, whereas the
DWN reliability is a bit more complex because it is the combination of
the actuator reliability according to the system structure function ϕ.
Figure 5.6 shows the control inputs applied to the actuators and the
weights used for the optimization. The curves αi (k) show the weight
values wi (k)

according to the
component reliability, the path availability linking sources to demand
and the potential component failures or repairs. Each weight wi (k) is
integrated in the trace of the matrix W (k) for the optimization process
and the computation of ˜u (k).

Dynamic Bayesian Networks: Control System Computation
95
A simulation scenario is divided into three steps:
– Step 1. No failure of the pumping station is considered but source
(Aporta) unavailability is simulated by (k = 0) and (k = 1, 000).
In this case, ApousE12 is easily available through path P7, with
components e5 (iRelleu) and e1 (iEstrella12) that are the most
reliable actuators. Paths P7 and P8 are used to satisfy consumer
demand. The control inputs ˜u1 (k) and ˜u2 (k) are then used at maximum
capacity. However, actuator saturations e1 and e2 do not meet the daily
peak demand value. It is thus ˜u3 (k) and ˜u8 (k) that are considered
to compensate for the saturations of ˜u1 (k) and ˜u2 (k). Component
e5 is mainly considered because this component is more reliable
than e6. The DWN functioning is thus based on links P6, P7 and
P8.
– Step 2. A critical failure occurs in e8 (iSJD50) at (k = 1, 000).
A Diagnostic function is supposed to detect and isolate the failures
correctly. The DBN computes the actuator weight wi (k) by integrating
the unavailability of component e8. In Figure 5.6, the curve of α8 (k)
goes to 0. The path P6 cannot be used to provide water to the
consumer. The control strategy switches to path P4. Actuators e7 and
e9 that were previously unused are activated. Between (k = 1000) and
(k = 2000), the components used are then e1, e2, e3, e5, e7 and e9. The
corresponding control inputs are then different from 0.
– Step 3. At (k = 2000) , a second critical failure occurs and is
simulated on pump e5 (iRelleu). The control strategy gives priority
to e5 that is not valid and paths P4, P7 and P8 cannot be used.
Consequently, the DBN computes the weights α1 (k), α2 (k), α5 (k)
and α7 (k) as being equal to 0 and the weight α8 (k). Only the paths
containing e6 (iCornella100), i.e. P1 and P2, cannot be used. The
system is then reconﬁgured to work with components e3, e4, e6 and
e9. The DBN computes the weights α3 (k), α4 (k), α6 (k) and α9 (k)
as equal to 1 because there is no other valid working scenario.
5.5. Conclusion
A modeling method based on DBN has been proposed in this
chapter. It is dedicated to reliability modeling of the system and its

actuators to integrate the component states into the control allocation
of the system being modeled.
Each step of the system has been formalized. The control process
combines a load allocation for all the actuators given the actuators’
reliability and their contribution to the system’s working state. It is not
only the goal to preserve the components’ health but also to ensure
system availability. This original strategy is applied both in normal
conditions and in failure scenarios.

Conclusion
Despite the maturity of BN’s formalism and their application in
industrial problems, it is necessary to formalize the procedures or the
construction methodologies of the model. If the data are not available
for automatic learning of the model, a major effort must be made to
focus on the structuring of knowledge and construction of the model
because the robustness of the model is based on the quality and
rightness of the modeling methodology.
Modeling the functional consequences of failures from
structured knowledge
Several modeling methods are proposed in this book to formalize the
BN to compute the reliability and impact of degradation of components
in the functional architecture of the system. Components and failure
modes are then naturally described by multi-state variables, e.g. derived
from FMEA or HAZOP analysis, which is difﬁcult to model by other
methods.
This book proposes deﬁning the model with different levels of
abstraction according to knowledge from functional analysis tools such
as structured analysis and design technique, also known as IDEF0. The
impact (probabilistically) of failure propagated on the system functions
appears in terms of realization of the function or occurrence of failure
modes.

Beneﬁts of Bayesian Network Models
The PRM modeling approach is very interesting because it allows
the development of models from elementary structures. Thanks to this
ﬂexibility, the construction of a model with different levels of
abstraction is facilitated. PRM capabilities capitalize knowledge by
creating generic classes that need to be instantiated on a particular
system.
The inference algorithms in the PRM facilitate the calculation of
large models and complex systems. The use of the concept of class
allows the deﬁnition of a family of objects that share common
properties in a probabilistic network: graph, attributes, references and
probabilistic relationships. It is a modeling formalism that should
become unavoidable in dependability [MED 13, MED 15].
Dynamic modeling system reliability based on the reliability
of components from the environment
This book shows that through the factorization of the joint
distribution, DBN allows signiﬁcantly lower complexity in a MC and a
setting that is much easier to achieve. DBN extends the use of
variations of parameters in time, which broadens the modeling power
to the non-homogeneous MC.

structures equivalent to the MSM, HMM and IOHMM which are used
in the modeling framework of component reliability. These models
correspond naturally to the phenomena encountered in reliability
calculation. The states of the components are not observable; only the
consequences of the degradation of the component are visible through
the failure modes that appear in the functional view of the system.
This type of modeling is applicable to the prognosis of functioning.
DBN formalize the relation between the dynamics of component
reliability taking into account aging (failure rates varying over time)
and the functions of the system. The resulting models are large in size

and have been proposed using a BN dynamic object orientation
[WEB 06] to facilitate the construction and maintenance of the model.
Synthesis of the control law with the aim of optimizing
system reliability
based on its sensitivity to actuator
failures
This book initially focused on the analyses of reliability of actuators
but poses the question in a more general context of control. The book
proposes a structured control system incorporating optimization
functions and variable probabilistic assessment functions related to the
reliability of the components and system. The sensitivity of the system
reliability degradation due to actuator loads generated by the control is
a key to control allocation. This is the direction that gives the best
results. This book is the ﬁrst to propose this idea, and the increase in
interest within the scientiﬁc community conﬁrms this direction of
research. It is a line of research with high application potential for the
coming years [SAL 15].
In general, the contributions of this book tend towards the
formalization of probabilistic models with large functional and
dysfunctional systems by formalizing views that have an impact on the
operating environment and behavior of the system. This addresses the
current problems faced by industrialists who must integrate more and
more parameters in analyses to meet demands and government safety
guidelines.

The application of Bayesian Networks (BN) or Dynamic Bayesian
Networks (DBN) in dependability and risk analysis is a recent
development. A large number of scientific publications show the
interest in the applications of BN in this field. 
Unfortunately, this modeling formalism is not fully accepted in
the industry. The questions facing today's engineers are focused
on the validity of BN models and the resulting estimates. Indeed,
a BN model is not based on a specific semantic in dependability
but offers a general formalism for modeling problems under
uncertainty. 
This book explains the principles of knowledge structuration to
ensure a valid BN and DBN model and illustrate the flexibility and
efficiency of these representations in dependability, risk analysis
and control of multi-state systems and dynamic systems. 
Across five chapters, the authors present several modeling
methods and industrial applications are referenced for illustration
in real industrial contexts.
Philippe Weber is Professor at the Engineer School of Sciences
and Technologies at the University of Lorraine and at the
Research Centre for Automatic Control in Nancy, France. His
research concerns dependability and is mainly focused on
probabilistic graphical models.
Christophe Simon is Associate Professor at the Research Centre
for Automatic Control in Nancy, France. His research concerns
dependability and is mainly focused on modeling engineering
and uncertainties.
