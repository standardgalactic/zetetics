Springer Undergraduate Texts in Philosophy

The Springer Undergraduate Texts in Philosophy offers a series of self-contained
textbooks aimed towards the undergraduate level that covers all areas of philosophy
ranging from classical philosophy to contemporary topics in the ﬁeld. The texts will
include teaching aids (such as exercises and summaries) and will be aimed mainly
towards more advanced undergraduate students of philosophy.
The series publishes:
• All of the philosophical traditions
• Introduction books with a focus on including introduction books for speciﬁc
topics such as logic, epistemology, German philosophy etc.
• Interdisciplinary introductions – where philosophy overlaps with other scientiﬁc
or practical areas
This series covers textbooks for all undergraduate levels in philosophy particu-
larly those interested in introductions to speciﬁc philosophy topics.
We aim to make a ﬁrst decision within 1 month of submission. In case of a
positive ﬁrst decision the work will be provisionally contracted: the ﬁnal decision
about publication will depend upon the result of the anonymous peer review of the
complete manuscript. We aim to have the complete work peer-reviewed within 3
months of submission.
Proposals should include:
• A short synopsis of the work or the introduction chapter
• The proposed Table of Contents
• CV of the lead author(s)
• List of courses for possible course adoption
The series discourages the submission of manuscripts that are below 65,000
words in length.
For inquiries and submissions of proposals, authors can contact Christi.Lue @

Preface and Overview of the Book
The Swedish predecessor of this book, Introduktion till Vetenskapsteorin, grew out
of an urgently felt need when I was teaching philosophy of science for students of
engineering, physics, biology, social science, medicine and nursing. These students
have normally no philosophical background and quite often little knowledge of
history of science. This book has now been in print for 15 years, and three editions
and its relative success in Sweden have encouraged me to make a translation to
English in the hope that a wider audience also will ﬁnd it useful.
This book is not merely a translation of the Swedish book; I have also made some
changes. First, Ties Niessen suggested a slight reshufﬂe of the chapters and an
addition of a short Chap. 14, with some actual and forward-looking reﬂections,
which I have done. Second, I have rewritten Sect. 10.7, since I have come to
understand laws better. Third, I have made a great number of minor changes as a
result of comments and suggestions from two anonymous referees. Their advice
was very helpful.
The prime goal for a ﬁrst course in philosophy of science should be, I believe, to
convey an understanding of what science is: how it has developed, what its core
traits are, how to distinguish between science and pseudoscience and to know what
a scientiﬁc attitude is.
In such an endeavour it is common and natural to concentrate on the develop-
ment and core traits of natural science. However, students and scholars within the
social sciences and humanities often think that these sciences differ profoundly
from natural science and that the lessons from Galilei, Newton and other natural
scientists are not relevant for them.
Here a remark about the word ‘humanities’ is in place. Hume and other
eighteenth-century British philosophers used the word ‘moral sciences’ as a label
for studies we now would call ‘humanities’. The effect is that the word ‘science’
without modiﬁer now means natural science only. This is not so in German,
Swedish and other Germanistic languages, where the corresponding words
(‘Wissenshaft’ ‘vetenskap’) are used for all systematic studies at universities. It
seems to me that using the word ‘humanities’ encourages people to see the
v

differences rather than the similarities among different disciplines, and since I want
to stress commonalities among the sciences, I suggest using the expression ‘human
sciences’ as replacing ‘humanities’.
It is commonly assumed that natural science is concerned with testing hypoth-
eses and discovering natural laws, whereas the aim of human and some social
sciences typically is to achieve understanding, i.e. understanding the meanings of
individual’s and social group’s actions. Such understanding may be achieved by
some interpretative method, which is seen as profoundly different from the method
of testing hypotheses.
I have no objections against these two broad characterisations of respectively
natural science and human and social sciences, but I disagree about the tacit
assumption that testing of hypotheses and making interpretations – doing herme-
neutics – are radically different activities. In fact, I think a good case can be made
for the view that interpretation of texts, utterances, behaviour, cultural phenomena,
etc., are species of hypothesis testing, not, of course, hypotheses about regularities,
as in natural and some social sciences, but about meanings. The structural similar-
ities between the hypothetico-deductive method, the hermeneutic circle and
Davidson’s rules for interpretation are not difﬁcult to recognize, once one has
freed oneself from the idea that hypotheses by necessity are about regularities in
the world. Dagﬁnn Føllesdal was, as far as I know, the ﬁrst to point out these
similarities. However, it is still a controversial view and one aim of the book is to
give some arguments for it.
But why stressing similarities between the sciences? The main reason is that we
need to say something general about all sciences in order to effectively demarcate
between science and pseudoscience, which in my view is a prime duty when
teaching elementary philosophy of science. Pseudoscience is quite popular and
many people are astonishingly credulous and/or prey of wishful thinking. And some
people just dress up their activities, whatever they are, by calling them ‘science’ just
because it enhances the prestige of what they are doing, or so they think.
So how to demarcate? It won’t do to say that each particular science has its own
rules of inquiry, its own criteria for being scientiﬁc, because then proponents of, for
example, homeopathy could say: ‘Yes, we agree that every discipline has its own
criteria and that applies as well to homeopathy: our criteria differ somewhat from
school medicine (an expression often used by homeopaths when they talk about
medical science taught at universities) but our criteria are just as scientiﬁc as those
of school medicine and we are just as scientiﬁc as they are. Proponents from school
medicine act as imperialists on the market for theories about treatment of diseases
when they denounce us’.
This argument we need to rebut, and the way to do that is to argue that scientiﬁc
thinking, independent of domain of inquiry, ought to satisfy some fundamental and
general epistemic demands. Hence, we need common criteria for any activity
properly being called scientiﬁc. I believe that the hypothetico-deductive method
and strictures on valid observation reports are the main components in such a list of
criteria.
vi
Preface and Overview of the Book

Some people are sceptical about the possibility of ﬁnding general criteria for
science, although they see the need. In particular, it has been argued that the
hypothetico-deductive method is too strong a criterion for scientiﬁc work, since
there are some activities that best are described as ‘data mining’ or ‘data collection’
in some scientiﬁc disciplines, activities that are not driven by any explicit hypoth-
esis, and we do not want to dismiss such activities as unscientiﬁc. I agree that we do
not want to do that. However, hypothetico-deductive method is not a criterion for
every activity called ‘research’ in a discipline; it is better viewed as a criterion on
the discipline as a whole. The fact that some researchers in some disciplines
sometimes engage is ‘data mining’ or the like doesn’t entail that the discipline
fails the general criterion for being a science.
The need for general criteria for scientiﬁc thinking is no more than an instance of
the epistemological demand to produce reasons, acceptable to others, for your
claims to know. Rational scientiﬁc discussions about methods, measurements,
inferences and conclusions presuppose that it is possible to discuss and agree on
epistemological and scientiﬁc norms independently of whether one accepts the
conclusions of a particular theory or not. It won’t do to have acceptance of the
method used from only those who already believe the theory and its results. (There
is indeed a problem here; some areas of research such as advanced mathematics or
modern theoretical physics are understood by a very limited number of researchers,
but I leave that aside for the moment.)
Hence, I believe it is very important to have some sort of general conception of
all sciences when discussing the demarcation between science and pseudoscience.
A related topic is the theory-relatedness of observations; some have claimed that
there are no such things as fully theory-independent observations. If true, it would
undermine the possibility of objectivity of science and force us to accept strong
relativism. I believe that this disastrous consequence can be avoided and that there
really is a basis of theory-neutral data, also in the humanities. This is the topic of
Chaps. 4 and 5.
These considerations have guided the structure of the ﬁrst part of the book,
consisting of Chaps. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
The second part consists of Chaps. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. In these chapters I discuss
topics I have found relevant and useful to talk about even at an introductory
philosophy of science course, viz. causes, explanations, laws and models. Causa-
tion is arguably the most important of these topics since almost all empirical
disciplines contain causal idiom to some extent and the search for causes is in
many disciplines a prime goal.
The notion of explanation is often connected to causation, but the use of the word
‘explanation’ differs profoundly from context to context and one may wonder if
there really is anything in common to everything we call an ‘explanation’. This is
the topic of Chaps. 8 and 9.
Laws and models are core concepts in natural sciences but less so in social science
and perhaps not at all in human science. The discussion about the concept of natural
law is intense among philosophers of science and a lot of views have been propounded.
In Chap. 10 I discuss some of them and indicate my own empiricist position.
Preface and Overview of the Book
vii

By contrast, models are not much discussed among philosophers of science. This
is a bit astonishing, since scientists very often talk about models when discussing
the ‘ﬁt’ between theory and reality. One is immediately prone to ask what kind of
epistemological and ontological status models have. In Chap. 11 I discuss this and
what scientists might mean with their talk about models.
The ﬁnal part consists of some additional material that is naturally brought up in
a philosophy of science course, although it does not belong to philosophy of science
proper.
Chapter 12 is about some issues in philosophy of mind, a topic usually not
covered in a philosophy of science course, or book. The reason I nevertheless have
included a brief discussion about mind states is that in particular students in
psychology and medicine are naturally confronted with difﬁcult questions about
the relations between mind and body. My experience is that these students some-
what unreﬂectively adopt a vocabulary reﬂecting substance dualism, for example,
the distinction between biological and psychological causes of mental diseases and
aberrant behaviour. (And neurophysiology and psychiatry are considered as two
different medical subdisciplines, a distinction suggesting a traditional mind-body
dualism.) However, when asked about what they think about the matter, most are
prepared to say that the mind and the brain somehow are identical or two sides of
the same coin. In short, their position is unstable and needs to be discussed.
Chapter 13 contains a discussion of some aspects of values in science, the most
important being the discussion about the concepts value-free and value-laden, once
introduced by Weber. The important point is that science is driven by values, it is
value-laden, but its results can, and should, be value-free.
Chapter 14 contains some reﬂections on actual trends in science. It is forward-
looking and much more tentative than the rest of the book.
Finally, there is a short appendix about logical form, which hopefully can be
useful in discussions of hypotheses testing, and in some accounts of explanation. I
have in particular experienced student’s difﬁculties in understanding the truth
conditions of the material conditional, a topic which hardly can be avoided when
analysing hypothesis testing. It seems to me that students without logical training
often interpret conditional statements in their context as either causal or logical
statements.
Thus, the reader I have had in mind is ﬁrst and foremost a student taking a course
in philosophy of science without having studied philosophy earlier.
The book is also useful as textbook for an introductory course at undergraduate
level for students majoring in philosophy. A number of colleagues, and myself,
have used the Swedish predecessor of this book in such courses and our experience
is that it is well suited also for that purpose. In such courses we normally omit
Chap. 2 (knowledge) and Chap. 12 (philosophy of mind), since these topics are
covered in other philosophy courses.
Two of my former students, David McVicker and George Masterton, both of
which are native English speakers, have helped me with the English translation of
my Swedish textbook. David did the ﬁrst draft, which then was checked by George.

What Is Science?

Chapter 1
The Evolution of Science
And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It
was the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king
and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people,
because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses, his
priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to
free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom:
moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed
with a suppliant’s wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but
most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.

1.1
Greece: The Dawn of Science
Only a short moment’s contemplation shows us that science plays an enormous role
in modern western societies. Scientiﬁc achievements have improved quality of life
for billions of people in many ways. On the other hand, in certain respects, scientiﬁc
advancements have worsened our quality of life. In addition, scientiﬁc advance-
ment has often come at the expense of the rest of nature. In fact, some would even
argue that science causes more harm than good, an opinion which I deem absurd. In
any case, everyone can agree that science has greatly inﬂuenced the course of life
all over the world.
From a global perspective, the evolution of science, and the consequent trans-
formation of society, is a unique process. Throughout the ages, many societies have
attained high levels of cultural development and organization (streets and roads,
irrigation, educational institutions, organized postal service, formal justice systems,
etc.). Yet, for the most part, modern western societies were the ﬁrst to develop
systems that saved large portions of its population from starvation and lengthened
the average lifespan. Natural questions one might wish to ask in the light of these
phenomena are how this societal change began, why it began in Western Europe,
and why it began when it did?
Most would agree that these questions regard a profound change–a true
revolution–that is considered the most signiﬁcant historical development since
the invention of agriculture. One can distinguish two somewhat distinct processes
in this revolution: (i) the scientiﬁc revolution, which is usually placed in the period
1550–1650 A.D. and (ii) the industrial revolution, which began in England in the

1700s. The connection between these two revolutions is a controversial issue: some
think that the industrial revolution was, for the most part, independent of the science
of the day, while others think that a pertinent precondition for this process is the
evolution of science and the so-called scientiﬁc perspective.
That the industrial transformation of western societies in the last hundred years
is largely a result of scientiﬁc developments is undisputed. However, there is a
question as to the role played by scientiﬁc insights in the beginning of the industrial
transformation. In other words, we may ask, when did science begin to gain
industrial and economic importance? Without taking a deﬁnite stance to this
question, one can point at Sadi Carnot’s (1796–1832) studies concerning the
effectiveness of steam engines as a clear example of a scientiﬁc study, which was
not founded on pragmatic demands, and yet had direct technical relevance. In his
famous book ‘Reﬂections on the Motive Power of Fire’ (1824) Carnot discusses the
effectiveness of the steam engine, starting from purely theoretical principles.
Guided by his insights, one could immediately introduce substantial improvements
in the efﬁciency of steam engines. A crucial step was Carnot’s introduction of the
concept of a quantitative measure of heat, Calorie. The previous long-lived idea
that heat was a substance was replaced by the conception of heat as a quantitative
property and the successful use of Carnot’s theory convinced people that this new
conception was correct.
However, the scientiﬁc revolution started much earlier at around the middle of
the 1500s in northern Italy, England, and Holland, the commercial centres of the
time. Why then and in those areas? What are the causes of the scientiﬁc revolution?
These questions are not only of historical interest! Many developing countries are
now quickly attempting to embrace scientiﬁc and technological achievements with
the kind assistance of humanitarian an U.N. organizations. However, the results of
these endeavours are varied and sometimes discouraging. Thus there is anecdotal
evidence that we lack sufﬁcient understanding of the essential aspects of this
process of transition.
In all likelihood, a wide range of circumstances is required for scientiﬁc thinking
to emerge in a society and be applied in economic and industrial contexts. Among
these circumstances one may distinguish between external and internal factors.
External factors include, but are not limited to, religious, economical and political
factors, and they act in fairly obvious ways as external constraints on our society’s
intellectual development. Internal factors include theories of knowledge, world-
views, and norms of argumentation, which are, by and large, inherited. The ideas
and concepts inherited from ancient thinkers is a factor that I shall argue actively
contributed to the scientiﬁc revolution gaining momentum during the renaissance in
Western Europe. We must keep in mind that many cultures have preceded ours in
history; and yet, none of them achieved a similar breakthrough in scientiﬁc think-
ing. Which components of this ancient heritage were signiﬁcant, and what was
lacking from those earlier cultures whose absence prevented them from developing
an active science?

The Evolution of Science

As every history must begin somewhere, and as the germ of science is clearly
gleaned in ancient Greece, let us begin this brief study of the historical precondi-
tions of science there. To fully appreciate ancient Greek efforts towards scientiﬁc
thinking, one would have to consider and discuss a great many things, but I shall
here limit myself to four ideas that have proven particularly signiﬁcant. I do not
dare argue that these four ideas are the most signiﬁcant as regards the evolution of
scientiﬁc thinking, only that they are important. The four ideas are (1) the Ionian
natural philosopher’s way of explaining nature, (2) the emphasis on rational
argumentation, (3) Aristotle’s introduction of the concept of logical validity, and
(4) Euclid’s axiomatic mathematics.
1. Ionian Natural Philosophy We usually consider the dawn of philosophy and
science to have occurred around 600 B.C. in the Greek cities along the coast of Asia
Minor, particularly Miletus. The ﬁrst of the famous philosophers of this period are
Thales (approx. 600 B.C.), Anaximander, Anaximander (610–546 B.C.), and
Anaximenes (?–525 B.C.). Based on the fragments left behind, and the comments
of their successors, we can conclude that these three philosophers asked the
question: What is it that comprises all things? What is the underlying substrate?
They thought that there must be something constant lying behind all of nature’s
transformations: plants and animals grow, thrive, produce offspring and die,
weather varies and everything in nature changes. But changes presuppose some-
thing that does not change.
Thales thought that the underlying substrate, or principle,1 that which is respon-
sible for the change in all things, is water. This is perhaps not so strange an idea,
since all biological processes require water, and all living things contain large
amounts of water. Thales perhaps reached this conclusion by noticing that a living
organism requires a large amount of water for its survival, and similarly, when it
dies it releases a great deal of water.
Anaximander argued that the underlying substance was not any of the then
recognized elements, earth, water, air or ﬁre, but a more primary substrate, apeiron
(‘the indeﬁnite’), which was thought to be boundless, eternal and unchanging. His
argument against Thales is quite interesting: If water was the underlying substance,
then over time it would have won the cosmic battle against the other elements, and
everything would have returned to water. However, this is not the case. Thus the
underlying substrate must be neutral with respect to the four elements. Obviously,
the tacit assumption is that changes are to be conceived as a kind of struggle
between the elements.
Lastly, Anaximenes claimed that the underlying substrate or principle was air.
His idea was that all the other elements were comprised of condensed or rareﬁed air.
This theory, although false, is interesting as it is purely physical and explains the
generation of the other elements.
1 The Greek word is ‘aitia’ which is translated as ‘cause’, ‘reason’, or ‘responsibility’.

These primitive ideas do not strike us as particularly scientiﬁc, but we must not
judge them based on what we now know. Rather, they should be judged with
respect to the general presuppositions and ways of thinking that existed during
that time period. In this context, it is apparent that the Ionian thinkers had taken a
signiﬁcant step toward developing a scientiﬁc mode of enquiry. For how did the
Greeks and other peoples of the time think about natural phenomena? What did one
see as the cause of nature’s changes? One could summarize the typical answer in
one word: myths. Natural phenomena – including personal destinies – were con-
trolled by various gods, spirits, or demons, whose favour one was want to win. One
can ﬁnd examples of this thinking in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey (ca. 700 B.C.).
Particularly illuminating is Homer’s explanation (in the beginning of Iliad, see the
quotation at the beginning of this chapter) of an outbreak of plague in the Greek
army that was besieging Troy. The cause of this outbreak was said to be that the god
Apollo was angry with Agamemnon, because he, the king and commander, had
insulted Apollo’s priest; and therefore Apollo sent the plague. In short, changes in
nature were thought to depend upon the will of the gods. That is to say, one
explained natural phenomena in the same terms as one would explain human
actions. The Ionian philosopher’s broke with this tradition of thought; and in so
doing, took a step towards a scientiﬁc approach.
A clear example of the Ionian philosopher’s inﬂuence on Greek culture is
Hippocrates’ (460–377 B.C.) view on the origins of disease. He writes the follow-
ing regarding epilepsy, called ‘the sacred disease’ because it commonly was
thought to have been sent by the gods:
It is thus with regard to the disease called Sacred: it appears to be nowise more divine nor
more sacred than other diseases, but has a natural cause from the originates like other
affections. Men regard its nature and cause as divine from ignorance and wonder, because it
is not at all like other diseases. And this notion of its divinity is kept up by their inability to
comprehend it, and the simplicity of the mode by which it is cured, for men are freed from it
by puriﬁcations and incantations. . .
And the disease called the Sacred arises from causes as the others, namely, those things,
which enter and quit the body, such as cold, the sun, and the winds, which are never
changing and are never at rest. And theses things are divine, so that there is no necessity for
making a distinction, and holding this disease to be more divine than the others, but all are
divine, and all human.2
2. Rational Argumentation Ancient Athenians took a lively interest in argumenta-
tion. This may be connected to the fact that its democratic constitution. Athens was
under the classical period (ca. 400 B.C.) a democracy, although one that excluded
women and slaves. Political decisions were taken by the citizens assembled at the
agora. In a democracy each person who wishes to implement his ideas must
convince others by arguing for them. The natural question then is to which forms
of argument are effective, and thus arose an interest in rhetoric and argumentation.
Another effect of democracy is a change in attitude towards other people, since one

cannot usually convince people by treating them as subordinates. This realization
lead free male adults in ancient Athens to treat each other as equals.
The difference between ancient Athens and other highly developed cultures of
the same time period, e.g. China, is illuminating. During this period, China was split
into many different states, all controlled by autocratic kings. Political inﬂuence was
thus only possible for the advisors to these kings. This had the effect that more
authoritarian attitudes were promoted. In order to illustrate the difference between
Chinese and Greek societies during this period, we can compare two texts. The
Chinese text is taken from ‘Analects’ by Confucius, or Kung Fu Tzu (551–479 B.
C.), in which he (who made his living as an advisor to kings and rulers) is
conversing with his students. The Greek text is Plato’s ‘Theaetetus’, in which
Socrates is conversing with Theaetetus, a young man who is studying mathematics:
From ‘Analects’:
Tzu Kung (one of Confucius’ disciples) asked about the conditions for government.
The Master
replied
‘The requisites for the exercise of power are enough food, enough
weapons, and the conﬁdence of the people.’
Tzu Kung said
‘Suppose you had to do without one of these; which would you
give up ﬁrst?’
The Master
said
‘Weapons.’
Tzu Kung said
‘What if you had to give up one of the remaining two; which
would it be?’
The Master
said
‘Food. All men must die, but a state cannot survive without the
conﬁdence of its people.3’
From ‘Theaetetus’
Theaetetus
Well, Socrates, after such encouragement from you, it would hardly
be decent for anyone not to try his hardest to say what he has in him.
Very well then. It seems to me that a man who knows something
perceives what he knows, and the way it appears at present, at any
rate, is that knowledge is simply perception.
Socrates
There’s a good frank answer, my son. That’s the way to speak one’s
mind. But come now, let us look at this thing together, and see
whether what we have here is really fertile or a mere wind-egg. You
hold that knowledge is perception?
Theaetetus
Yes.
3 Different translations have divided Analects differently. At http://classics.mit.edu/Confucius/
analects.3.3.html the quotation is in section 3, part 12, at http://www.indiana.edu/%7Ep374/
Analects_of_Confucius_(Eno-2015).pdf the passage is found in book 12.

Socrates
But look here, this is no ordinary account of knowledge you’ve come
out with: it’s what Protagoras used to maintain. He said the very same
thing; only he put it rather a different way. For he says, you know, that
‘Man is the measure of all things: of the things which are, that they
are, and of things which are not, that they are not.’ You have read this,
of course?
Theaetetus
Yes, often.
Socrates
Then you know that he puts it something like this, that as each things
appears to me, so it is for me, and as it appears to you, so it is for you –
you and I each being a man?
Theaetetus
Yes, that is what he says.’ (Trans. M. J. Levett)
The exempliﬁed difference in attitude between teacher and pupil is pretty clear,
in my view.
3. The Discovery of Logic Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) made many important contri-
butions to science and philosophy, but we shall here only discuss his introduction
and analysis of logical validity. Whether an argument is valid has to do with its
form, and not with the meaning of the words used–excepting the logical ones–used
in the argument. Aristotle was the ﬁrst to make this distinction, and the ﬁrst to study
the general rules for argumentation. Here I shall brieﬂy discuss his theory of
syllogisms. A syllogism is an argument that can be constructed using the following
four sentence types:
All A are B.
Some A are B.
Some A are not B.
No A are B.
The symbols A and B stand for categories. If one takes three such sentences
where each pair contains one common category term, one can produce 256 different
combinations. A couple of examples are
All A are B
All B are C
All A are C
and similarly
All A are B
No B are C
No A are C
It is easy to convince oneself that in both these examples, if the ﬁrst two
sentences are true, then the third sentence must also be true. It makes no difference
which categories one chooses the symbols A, B, and C to stand for. This is a
deﬁnition of logically valid inference. Aristotle analysed all 256 of the possible
8
1
The Evolution of Science

variations and showed that only 24 of them are such that, if the ﬁrst two sentences
were true, then the third must also be true.
Of course, syllogisms are only a small part of logic, but what is important here is
that Aristotle realized that in analysing an argument one can pose two questions,
namely (1) are the premises true, and (2) does the conclusion follow from the
premises? In order for an argument to be deemed sound, both of these questions
must be answered in the afﬁrmative. Aristotle’s priceless contribution is that he
drew attention to the formal side of argumentation.
4. The Axiomatic Ideal The fourth important contribution to the development of
the scientiﬁc approach is Euclid’s axiomatization of mathematics. This was an
enormous step forward from what had previously been known about mathematics.
The students of the time before Euclid were taught a great deal about practical
mathematics. That is to say, they were taught mathematical methods for solving
practical problems associated with commerce, transportation, astronomy and mea-
surement. In these situations, there can be raised two fundamental questions: (i) do
these rules for calculation give accurate results, and (ii) in cases in which one is
certain that the results are accurate, on what grounds do we base this mathematical
certainty?
Euclid’s contribution was to show that all the mathematics of the day (and a
great deal more) could be logically deduced from a few axioms, i.e., sentences that
were obviously true and did not require further justiﬁcation. Mathematics became a
deductive science: from secure premises (axioms), new knowledge was inferred
using strict logical rules. That is to say, a mathematical proof gives certainty. Euclid
was so successful with his axiomatic-deductive method that for a long time it was
considered the archetype of how science should operate. A good example of
Euclid’s inﬂuence is Baruch Spinoza’s magnum opus Ethica Ordine Geometrico
Demonstrata (1675). As the title (‘Ethics proven by Geometric Methods’) suggests,
Spinoza presents ethics as an axiomatic system, precisely as Euclid did with
geometry.
Euclid’s axiomatic mathematics led to a scientiﬁc ideal, the axiomatic science
ideal, which can be characterized in the following way:
•
Science aims to attain certain knowledge, not mere beliefs or opinions.
•
Begin by setting up axioms, i.e. truths so obvious that they require no further
justiﬁcation.
•
Next, deduce new truths from these axioms using strict logical methods.
In geometry and elementary arithmetic it seems possible to ﬁnd axioms just by
reﬂecting upon geometrical ﬁgures and numbers, but how is it done in
e.g. mechanics or biology? In other words, how do we recognize true general
propositions from which one could deduce empirical facts in e.g., physics or
biology? Aristotle discussed this (Posterior Analytics 2.19.100a6-8); he argued
that repeated perceptions of things and events resulted in true general propositions,
such as ‘man is an animal’, or ‘the natural state of a body is rest’. The process of
generalising from repeated experience to such general propositions he called
1.1
Greece: The Dawn of Science
9

‘epagoge’, usually translated as ‘induction’. However, one should keep in mind that
he did not view this activity as a kind of scientiﬁc inference or be represented as an
inductive argument. (So the translation ‘induction’, given the usual meaning of this
word, is somewhat misleading.) Rather he describes the process more like an
automatic working of the mind in forming concepts and general propositions.
Such general propositions could then be used as premises in scientiﬁc demonstra-
tions. So all sciences have, in Aristotle’s view, the same axiomatic-deductive
structure, but the way we recognize axioms is different in different sciences.4
These four elements of our ancient Greek heritage – to seek explanations of
natural phenomena in nature’s internal properties, to argue on an even plane, to
investigate the rules of argumentation and logical validity, and to build them into a
logically consistent system–are all essential to the development of a scientiﬁc
approach.
One may wonder why science did not ﬂourish and develop is the days of the
Roman Empire, or those of the Caliphate, since both of these cultures further
developed the Greek culture. That this was not the case shows that the inheritance
of these ideas, in and of itself, is not sufﬁcient for a scientiﬁc revolution. However,
Greek views were probably a necessary factor for the emergence of the scientiﬁc
revolution almost 2000 years later. In order to understand just how monumental a
change would ensue, it is perhaps prudent to look at how people thought during the
middle ages.
1.2
The Medieval Worldview
The Roman Empire gradually declined and fell apart during the ﬁfth century and the
last emperor of Western Roman Empire, Romulus Augustus, lost power A.D. 476.
The decline of the Western Empire was followed by a rapid decline of organised
civilisation in Western Europe, and, astonishingly also a fast decline in population.
(According to a quite modern hypothesis this decline in population was caused by a
climate catastrophe, no summers for three consecutive years 536–538, which in
turn might have been caused by volcanic activity from the Ilopango Caldera in
central El Salvador, pouring out clouds of dust and hiding sunshine for several
years.) The Eastern Roman Empire continued until A.D. 1453, and Plato’s Acad-
emy in Athens still existed form some time, but the Emperor Justinian closed it
A.D. 529. Thus, organised study of philosophical and scientiﬁc texts from antiquity
almost disappeared both in western and eastern Europe. One may say that in Europe

observations one can generalise in many ways and the most natural one might be the wrong one, as
is illustrated by his own mistaken theory of motion and (ii) mathematical axioms are nowadays not
viewed as self-evident, but chosen by mathematicians for certain purposes.

The Evolution of Science

the philosophical and scientiﬁc heritage from Greece was lost for several hundred
years.
Population and culture slowly improved during the early Middle Ages and
around 1100 A.D. higher education started to reappear in the Western world. The
ﬁrst institutions of higher education–the precursors of the eventual Medieval
Universities – were medical and legal colleges in Italy. A century later, these
colleges had expanded into universities with various faculties: theological, medical,
juridical and artium liberalium, i.e., the liberal arts. Education in these universities
consisted in studying canonical works from ancient times, like Euclid’s Elements or
Galen’s works on anatomy. The view regarding knowledge at the time was that
knowledge was obtained through the study of classical texts. That one could
discover new information, or that the ancient thinkers could have made mistakes,
were not viable options (Fig. 1.1). When Aristotle became known in Christendom
around 1200 A.D. as a result translations from Arabic to Latin of Aristotle’ works
(the Greek heritage had been tended by Arabic scholars throughout the Dark Ages
in western Europe), Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) began what he saw as the
important task of interpreting Aristotle in a way that would not conﬂict with
Christianity. The result of Aquinas’ toils was what we now call scholasticism.
A good, though quite late, example of the medieval view of how one accrued
knowledge is given by Olaus Magnus’ Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus
(‘History of the Nordic Peoples’) (1555). Each and every chapter gives a fully
detailed description of what past authors have to say on the matter and how they
approached the subject. For example, Olaus Magnus often refers uncritically to
what Tacitus and Jordanes wrote about Ultima Thule. One would think that Olaus
Magnus, who was born and raised in Sweden, ought to have seen himself as a
superior authority on Nordic history, geography and habits and manner of living
than an author from antiquity who relied merely on hearsay. This lack of a critical
stance illuminates the scholarly attitude of the time. Certainly one does ﬁnd some
passages where Magnus is describing his own observations, but nowhere does one
ﬁnd a passage of the form ‘the famous author X’s view on the subject is incorrect
because I have investigated the matter and found it not to be the case’. Olaus
Magnus is essentially a Medieval scholar who was unaffected by the new currents,
which had at that time clearly begun to ﬂow.
But one could ﬁnd tendencies of experimental science already during the Middle
Ages, especially in England, though these tendencies did not lead directly to any
breakthroughs. This was perhaps because of a general distrust in the ability of a
sinful mankind to obtain true knowledge of God’s inscrutable creation. Or perhaps
it was due to the general opinion that this sort of knowledge was relatively
unimportant. One did not live long, hence that which was essential was the soul’s
salvation and whether one was destined for hell or heaven.
In studying the history of art, it is not difﬁcult to see a gradual shift in attitude
and the way of thinking throughout this period. Early in the Middle Ages, art is for
the most part symbolic and often intended to elicit religious emotions. Yet there
arises a tendency towards more naturalistic and representational art. A major step in
this process was the discovery of the central perspective that allowed artists to
1.2

depict people and scenery more accurately. It gradually becomes clear that interest
is shifting from art’s religious function to the possibility of producing more accurate
portrayals of the visible world. In due course, this shift leads eventually to the
Renaissance. This major change in Western culture, which includes–among other
things–a newfound interest in people and living conditions, helped lay the founda-
tions of the scientiﬁc revolution.
1.3
The Scientiﬁc Revolution
An important element of the scientiﬁc revolution was a new approach to nature and
the new form of knowledge thereof. People began to think that understanding
natural phenomena was important and interesting, a view which few people, at
least few among those who were literate and wrote, shared during the Middle Ages.
By the mid-1500s the belief that knowledge was to be found only in classical
texts began to be replaced by the belief that one’s own observations of natural

phenomena were necessary for knowledge of those phenomena. Closely related to
this belief was the idea that the authors of antiquity could be mistaken, and that it
was possible for contemporaneous scholars to correct those mistakes. The leading
reformer for this cause was Andreas Vesalius, (1514–1564) of the University of
Padua. His magnum opus On the Workings of the Human Body (1543) is generally
considered the ﬁrst modern text on anatomy. Vesalius’ book was built upon
comprehensive dissections, and he was able to refute many of Galen’s views,
which had been hitherto accepted as the authority on such matters. It marked the
ﬁrst appearance of a well-researched and essentially accurate description of the
human body (Fig. 1.2).
In the same year, 1543, Copernicus published his new theory regarding the solar
system. He was the ﬁrst in modern times (Aristarchus of Samos, circa 200 B.C., had
made similar claims, which inspired Copernicus) to state that it is the sun, and not

the Earth, that is located at the centre of the universe, and that the Earth and the
other planets revolve around it. One can argue quite conﬁdently that these two
events – the publications of Vesalius’ and Copernicus’ works – mark the starting
point of the scientiﬁc revolution.
Another clear case of this new approach to obtaining knowledge is exempliﬁed
by Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). He devoted much effort to observing the positions
and movements of celestial bodies from his observatory on the island of Ven in
Denmark (now the island belongs to Sweden). Brahe’s meticulous observational
data was later used by Kepler in the development of his famous three laws of
planetary motion (Fig. 1.3).
It is quite apparent that Brahe realized that he could obtain new knowledge,
knowledge that could not be found in the classical texts. Why else would he have
spent so many years making original observations? We should also keep in mind
that the telescope had not yet been invented, and yet Brahe was able to pinpoint the
position of planets and stars with an accuracy of 1 arc-minute, i.e. 1/60.

The Evolution of Science

It is apparent that mere observation is not sufﬁcient for doing science, in that one
has to somehow ‘process’ the observations (e.g. make classiﬁcations). The follow-
ing passage from Bacon5 is an example of this new perception of knowledge:
Those who have treated of the sciences have been either empiricists or dogmatists.
Empiricists, like ants, simply accumulate and use; Rationalists, like spiders, spin webs
from themselves; the way of the bee is in between: it takes material from the ﬂowers of the
garden and the ﬁeld; but it has the ability to convert and digest them. This is not unlike the
true working of philosophy; which does not rely solely or mainly on mental power, and
does not store the material provided by natural history and mechanical experiments in its
memory untouched but altered and adapted in the intellect. Therefore much is to be hoped
from a closer and more binding alliance (which has never yet been made) between these
faculties (i.e. the experimental and the rational). (The New Organon, book 1, sec XCV)
Why did the scientiﬁc revolution begin in Western Europe at the end of the
1500s? Why did it not begin in China under the Tang dynasty, which was a cultural
high period in China, or at the height of Arabic culture around the ninth century A.
D.? Indeed, why did it not begin in the Aztec and Inca civilizations? In order to give
a satisfactory answer to these questions one must, I think, apply both an external
and an internal perspective. One must take into account both religious, economic
and political factors (the external ones), as well as the ways that one obtains
knowledge and the nature of knowledge in general (the internal ones). To properly
merge these various aspects into a plausible explanation of why the scientiﬁc
revolution began in Europe is an enormous project, and one that lies far beyond
the scope of this book. However, one important question that we shall here discuss
is whether there is a generally valid scientiﬁc method, and whether it was this
method that began to be applied during the scientiﬁc revolution. My answer to this
question is, reservedly, yes. There is a generally valid scientiﬁc method, the
hypothetico-deductive method, of which more in Chap. 3, and it was this method
that began to be applied in the work of Vesalius, Galilei, Harvey, Brahe, Kepler,
Newton, and many more. The application of this method was an important factor,
perhaps the most important, in the creation of the modern sense of scientiﬁc
enterprise.
From the above discussion one might get the impression that the ancient Greek
heritage had nothing to do with the development of modern science. This is,
however, an incorrect conclusion. The scientiﬁc revolution consisted in a dramatic
change in the medieval perception of knowledge, which was in large part inherited
from the ancient Greeks. But, as we shall see in Chap. 3, there are ideas from
antiquity actively operating at the emergence of the fully modern scientiﬁc method:
the hypothetical-deductive method.

and inductive methods in science.

Theory of Science and Philosophy of Science
Theory of Science is a discipline that consists in investigations into the operations
of science from both external and internal perspectives. However, in the remainder
of this book we shall concentrate only on the internal perspective, which is the
‘philosophical’ perspective. We shall discuss such questions as: What is science?
How does one distinguish science from pseudo-science? What is knowledge? What
is a scientiﬁc explanation? What is a cause? What is a scientiﬁc hypothesis? What is
a scientiﬁc theory? What is a scientiﬁcally acceptable observation? Hence the aim
of this book is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of these issues, and
the key concepts and views that philosophers and scientists have developed to
answer the questions above.
The internal questions of Theory of Science belong to a part of philosophy; namely,
philosophy of science. Like all philosophy, philosophy of science begins with wonder
and bringing into question ‘common knowledge’. One often speaks of science as
something familiar, something that is easily identiﬁed. But, is this really the case?
Does there exist a universally accepted deﬁnition of scientiﬁc practice? No, there does
not; and even if it did, one could still ask how one might justify such a deﬁnition.
Theory of science, like the object of its study, also begins with questions regarding
constitution and function. But Theory of Science differs from science proper in that
there is no generally accepted school of thought from which to proceed. This fact can
either be seen as a failure (Theory of Science has not been able to produce any lasting
results) or as a distinctive character trait (Theory of Science is such that it does not
produce solid foundations, rather it contributes to a critical review of science). In my
opinion, the second alternative seems to be the most plausible.
Different questions within philosophy of science are relevant for different types
of scientists. For example, the following questions are relevant for medical scien-
tists: (1) What is a cause, in medical contexts? (2) What is the relation between the
body and the mind? (3) What criteria should be used to distinguish between the
practices of a charlatan and accepted scientiﬁc methods? The last question is a
special case of the more general issue of distinguishing between science and
pseudo-science. In discussing these three questions we are inevitably led to the
questions regarding the nature of knowledge in general; what knowledge is, how it
is that we obtain it, and how we can rely on this knowledge. Therefore, it is natural
to proceed with a discussion of the nature of knowledge in general, and whether or
not there is a common thread to be found in all activities we call science.
1.5
Summary
This chapter explains how our present conception of science is the result of a long
evolution starting in ancient Greece. In particular four Greek ideas are pointed out
as being crucial elements in scientiﬁc thinking: The ﬁrst is the conviction that
16
1
The Evolution of Science

properties and events in nature could be understood as the result of natural pro-
cesses, not as the effect of actions of gods and other supernatural agents. The second
is view that knowledge could be achieved by rational argumentation, not from holy
authorities. The third is the idea that a science should be systematic body of
knowledge and the fourth component is the discovery of logic as a basic ingredient
in rational thinking.
There was a clear empiricist trend in pre-Socratic Greek thinking, and to some
extent also later. This empiricist outlook regained importance in western thinking
around 1500 and was the central aspect of the scientiﬁc revolution.

Introduction
Science aims to give us knowledge, scientiﬁc knowledge. According to the classical
conception, the axiomatic ideal of science, scientiﬁc knowledge must be absolutely
certain, the result of demonstration from general principles. But, alas, certainty has
often proven to be an illusion; even Newton’s mechanics, one of the most admired
scientiﬁc theories and for a very long time believed to be certain, has proven not
completely true. Should we still say that it is a piece of scientiﬁc knowledge? The
answer depends, of course, on what conditions we should associate with the concept
of knowledge. What is knowledge?
2.2
Knowing That, Knowing How and Acquaintance
The everyday use of the word ‘know’ denotes a variety of things. The ﬁrst category
consists of truths and we specify that kind of knowledge as ‘knowing that’,
alternatively ‘propositional knowledge’. Such knowledge is such that its content
can be expressed by complete sentences. We have propositional knowledge if we
know that something is the case. The content of this knowledge–that which we
know–can be expressed in those complete sentences that follow ‘that’ in ‘I know
that . . .’. It can be obtained by listening to a lecture or reading a book, nothing more
is needed.

The second category consists of skills, such as riding a bike, playing a musical
instrument, speaking a foreign language, etc., which we indicate by the term
‘knowing how’. Such knowledge cannot be communicated only through language.
This is sometimes called tacit or practical knowledge. For example, learning how to
ride a bike requires both demonstration and practice. Much of our professional
knowledge includes these two elements. Indeed, one would hope that, e.g., dentistry
is ripe with both sorts of knowledge. Yet, it is often easy enough to draw a
somewhat clear line between propositional and non-propositional knowledge,
even within the same ﬁeld of study. For example, most medical educations make
a clear distinction between clinical and non-clinical courses, thus more or less
reﬂecting the distinction between knowing that and knowing how.
The third category consists of knowledge of objects. In German, French, Swed-
ish, Italian (and presumably other languages) the distinction between knowledge of
objects and knowledge of truths is made clear by using different verbs. In German
one distinguishes between ‘wissen’ and ‘kennen’, in French between ‘savoir’ and
‘connaitre’, in Swedish between ‘veta’ and ‘ka¨nna’ where the former words are
used when we talk about knowledge of truths and the latter when we are concerned
with knowledge of objects.
In common English there is no established corresponding distinction, which is a
drawback for doing epistemology. I suggest using the word ‘acquaintance’ as term
for knowledge of objects.1
The philosophical discussion about the nature of knowledge has almost exclu-
sively been about knowledge of truths. The reason for this is that a correct analysis
of this concept of is a highly controversial topic, whereas skills and knowledge
of objects has not evoked much controversy. Indeed, when someone claims that
he knows that something is the case (propositional knowledge), one is often want
to doubt the reasons for this claim and have difﬁculties knowing whether it is in fact
true or false. But if someone says that he knows how something should be done
(a skill), or that he knows a certain person one often ﬁnds that the truth of such
a claim is easy to verify. Thus, as we continue our discussion we shall concentrate
on propositional knowledge, which we shall henceforth simply refer to as
knowledge.
1 Russell once introduced the distinction between knowledge by description and knowledge by
acquaintance, which is not the same as that give here. According to Russell, the only things one
had knowledge by acquaintance of were sense data. Talking about sense data was in my view a
mistake; we have no knowledge about such things, since they don’t exist. But ordinary physical
objects, including persons exist, and these we may be acquainted with.

2.3
The Deﬁnition of Propositional Knowledge
The most common view among philosophers–derived from Plato–is that proposi-
tional knowledge is justiﬁed true belief. That is to say, if P stands for a particular
proposition, and if X stands for a person who holds this proposition, then X knows
that P if and only if:
•
P is true,
•
X can justify P,
•
X believes P.
Each one of these criteria is a necessary condition for knowledge, and these three
criteria are sufﬁcient when taken together. Why is it that so many have stuck with
this deﬁnition? An immediate answer to this question is that Plato’s deﬁnition
captures pretty well the everyday use of the word ‘knowledge’: the concept of
someone knowing a proposition. Consider the following three dialogues.
First Dialogue
Charlie
I know that New York is the capital of the U.S.A., I’m sure of it.
Lisa
You’re wrong, Washington D.C. is the capital of the U.S.A. It doesn’t
matter that you’re sure of it, because that only means that you strongly
believe in your claim, and that’s not the same as knowing. In order to
know something, that something has to be true.
Second Dialogue
Charlie
I know that it’s going to rain tomorrow.
Lisa
How do you know that?
Charlie
I just know it!
Lisa
If you can’t explain how you know that it’s going to rain, then you don’t
know it. Even if it is true that it will rain tomorrow, you don’t know that
unless you can explain how you came to your conclusion, or belief.
Third Dialogue
Charlie
I know that the speed of light is constant and independent of the speed of
the light source, but I don’t believe it.
Lisa
Why don’t you believe it?
Charlie
Because common sense tells me that the speed of a light ray should be the
sum of both the speed of the light source and the speed of the light ray
when it is emitted.
Lisa
Then why do you say that you know that the speed of light is constant?
Charlie
Because I know that Einstein claimed that it is the case, and all physicists
believe him.
2.3
The Deﬁnition of Propositional Knowledge
21

Lisa
But if you don’t believe it yourself, then you can’t claim that you know
that the speed of light is constant. All you can claim to know is that
Einstein and other physicists claim that the speed of light is constant,
which is completely different.
These dialogues are perhaps a bit artiﬁcial, yet they seem to reﬂect how we
typically view the proper use of the phrase ‘I know that. . .’. If they are accepted as
accurate reﬂections of every day speech, then they show that each of the criteria
above are necessary conditions for knowledge. Some philosophers have constructed
situations that purport to show that together the above criteria are not sufﬁcient for
knowledge; this is the famous Gettier’s problem, which I’ll discuss in Sect. 2.4. But
ﬁrst we shall discuss some implications of these critieria.
2.3.1
P Is True
If one knows that something is the case, one may make a claim expressing this fact
and that claim is then true. Another way of stating the same thing is to say that when
one knows that something is the case, one is simply describing a part of the world as
it actually is; since, to say that a proposition P is true is equivalent to asserting P.
This relationship between knowledge and truth is essential for our actions, when
we plan what to do; for if knowledge was independent of truth, what one knows
would be of no use in guiding one’s actions. This is a fatal consequence for all
situations in which one needs to use knowledge for some purpose. An example that
illustrates this point is the difference between the actions of the American Federal
Reserve in 1929 and 1987. During the stock market crash of 1929, the Federal
Reserve kept interest rates high (to defend the gold standard) and let a large number
of banks go bankrupt. This resulted in people loosing faith in their banks. This loss
of faith prompted people to remove their savings; thereby, making it impossible for
the banks to lend out money or make investments. Ultimately, all this culminated in
the great depression and a 60 % decrease in the GDP of the USA over 3 years. Not
until 1941 was the GDP back to the same level as 1929. This was certainly not
intended and it is clear that Federal Reserve did not know enough about the
mechanisms of the economy.
In 1987, with much better insight as to the workings of the economic system,
people realized that the role of the Federal Reserve was to ensure that the banking
system functioned properly, and to make sure that people believed that their money
was secure. The Federal Reserve took actions to ensure this security, and achieved
the desired results. For even though the stock market had a sharp decline for 1 week
in 1987, no depression resulted and the crisis was over within a year.
But was the knowledge about the economic mechanisms good enough? There
are discussions about the decision to let the Lehman Brothers bank go bankrupt in
2008, since it started a long period of low growth. Some say that the decision
22
2
Knowledge

makers had not properly learnt the lesson from the great depression. I have no
considered opinion about these matters; it only further highlights the point that true
justiﬁed beliefs, i.e. knowledge, is crucial for proper action.
Sometimes people equate ‘true’ with ‘true for me’. This is a mistake. Truth
should be understood in an absolute and objective sense: a proposition is true, or
false, simpliciter. The truth of a proposition is completely independent of the beliefs
and cultural context of the person who utters it. Indeed, one must clearly distinguish
between ‘P is true’ and ‘X believes that P is true’, for it is obvious that X can
believe P, i.e., that P is true, when in fact P is false, and vice versa. This implies that
a person can believe that he knows some proposition, even though the proposition is
false. Indeed, it often happens that long after one has claimed that a proposition is
true, one realizes that it is false; at which point one should admit the mistake and
withdraw the claim to know.
When talking about older theories some people are inclined to say that such
theories was true, but now they are false. I have, for example heard many students
saying that Ptolemy’s geocentric theory about the world, put forward in his Alma-
gest, was true in his times, but now it is false since it contradicts the heliocentric
theory which is true. Ptolemy’s theory is based on observations of the motion of the
sun, the moon, the planets and the stars. They all appear, from the view-point of an
observer at earth, to move around the Earth in circular motions.2 With Ptolemy’s
theory, one could make fairly accurate predictions of the positions and motions of
all celestial bodies visible with the naked eye, so Ptolemy’s theory was supported
by observations and had predictive power. Indeed, prior to the invention of optical
instruments, it was not possible to make any observation that would contradict his
theory. Almost anyone alive at a time prior to the invention of the telescope (early
1600s), would easily be convinced that one could obtain knowledge of the universe
by studying Ptolemy’s book. However, we now know that Ptolemy’s theory is false,
and that all those who claimed to have knowledge of the universe through the study
of Ptolemy’s work were mistaken.
We may say about ancient astronomers that they had good evidence for their
theory and they believed it, but we should not say that they knew how the world
system moved. For if I would say that they knew, I would accept that their belief is
true, which I do not.
Some are inclined to say that Ptolemy had knowledge of the planetary system,
but that we now have different (or better) knowledge. This statement implies that
one accepts that Ptolemy had false knowledge. But false knowledge is not knowl-
edge, just as counterfeit money is no real money (Fig. 2.1).
A common argument against an objective, absolute understanding of truth builds
on the fact that humans have developed many different cultures and conceptual
frameworks. Some claim that there is no such thing as absolute truth; that all truths
are relative to one’s culture, paradigm, theory or research domain. The argument is
2 This is a simpliﬁed picture; Ptolemy was forced to add so called epicycles, circles on the circles,
in order to get empirically adequate description of some of the planet’s motion.
2.3
The Deﬁnition of Propositional Knowledge
23

that we cannot say anything about the way the world is without the use of language
and our languages are human creations. From this premise one arrives at the
conclusion that truth is language dependent. Another way of stating the argument
is that humans live is different conceptual frameworks; and so there is no such thing
as truth in and of itself, but only truth in some conceptual framework.
There are plenty of arguments against this line of reasoning, of which the ﬁrst
was already laid forth in Plato’s Theaetetus. This dialogue contains a discussion of
Protagoras’ claim that things are as they appear to be. This claim is a version of the
relativistic thesis that there are no objective truths. Theaetetus, a young man who
ﬁnds himself in conversation with Socrates, puts forth Protagoras’ claim as a
possible deﬁnition of knowledge. Socrates then asks Theaetetus whether everyone
is in agreement with Protagoras regarding this matter, and Theaetetus answers that
most people are not. Socrates then responds that Protagoras must admit that his
claim is incorrect, for it says that things are as they appear and since to Protagoras’
opponents the view appears false, it is false. This leads one to realize that the thesis
that all truths are relative is self-contradictory. We cannot consistently say that all
truths are relative.

Another interesting argument against relativism, given by Donald Davidson,3 is
based on observations of human language-users. It is presented here in abbreviated
form:
1. To claim that other humans live in other conceptual frameworks (and that truth is
relative to some conceptual framework) than our own implies that we claim that
they think and speak.
2. To correctly claim that people think and speak requires that we know they are
actually saying something, and not just producing sounds.
3. In order to know that people are saying something, we have to at least know
something of what they mean.
4. In order to know what people mean, we must be able to translate some of their
utterances into our language.
5. In order to translate their utterances into our language, we must ascribe to them a
set of beliefs, desires, attitudes, and a way of connecting these mental elements
with each other.
6. In order to ascribe to people such mental elements, we must ﬁrst assume that
they share with us some background beliefs, desires and principles of thought.
7. But to have in common such a reference frame (beliefs, desires, and a capacity
for knowledge) is to be situated in the same conceptual framework.
A key step in this argument is premise 5. The basic idea is that interpretation of
what other people are saying requires that the interpreter ascribe to those people a
large number of true beliefs about reality. (This is an instance of the principle of
charity, a core element in Davidson’s theory of interpretation.) In addition, the
interpreter must also assume that the people, whose utterances are to be interpreted,
are rational: otherwise one cannot make any sense of the content of those utter-
ances. If this premise is accepted, then it seems that the conclusion is sure to follow.
The conclusion of this argument is that in order to claim that other people ‘live’
in different conceptual worlds, or frameworks, we must be in agreement, with
respect to these people, about a considerable number of propositions, regardless
of one’s conceptual framework. Thus both Davidson’s and Plato’s arguments show
that all-embracing relativism is not feasible.
There are thus strong arguments for the claim that the truth of a proposition
depends upon how the world is actually constituted and not on how we perceive
it. Aristotle formulates this idea as a deﬁnition of truth in his Metaphysics, (book
4, part 7):
To say of what is, that it is not, and to say of what is not, that it is, is false, while to say of
what is, that it is, and to say of what is not, that it is not, is true.
This passage is often interpreted as an expression of a correspondence idea: if a
sentence is true, then there is a correspondence between the sentence and what the
3 Donald Davidson (1917–2003), American philosopher of language and psychology. The argu-
ment is to be found in his paper ‘On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme’, printed in his (1984).

sentence is about. It is quite difﬁcult–some would say impossible–to describe more
precisely the nature of this correspondence, and such an inquiry is beyond the scope
of this book. Instead I shall move on to a discussion of the various consequences of
this idea.
One such consequence of the correspondence theory of truth is that a proposition
can be false even though we may have very good reasons for believing that it is true
(and vice versa). This consequence opens the door for the sceptics, who want to
argue that we can never be certain that we know anything. If the sceptics are correct,
then the search for truth becomes pointless, since one can never be certain that it is
ever attained. This seems to be a very strange conclusion. Indeed, consider
humanity’s canon of reasonable beliefs; there are good reasons for believing that
a great deal of these are knowledge by virtue of being true. Yet, there are also good
reasons for believing that some part of this canon is false. In other words, some
(hopefully small) part of what we call knowledge is not knowledge. Of course, we
do not know which parts of what we call knowledge are false: were we aware of
such falsities, we would certainly separate it out and label it accordingly. (This very
activity is often a result of research; one discovers that something previously
accepted as knowledge is false). However, it would hardly be rational to throw
away everything we take to be knowledge on account of a few bad eggs hidden
among the good. The rational stance is surely an attitude of provisional belief: every
proposition we call knowledge is probably true, but there is a risk of it actually
being false, and so we should be mentally prepared to change our beliefs if new
evidence presents itself.
A sceptic would ask: how do you know that most of what you call knowledge is
true? Maybe it is all false! My answer to this question is simply that, in practical
situations, even the sceptic takes an enormous amount of his beliefs as unproble-
matically true. I shall show this by giving a few examples.
Suppose the sceptic has a TV, and suppose that he pays for cable programming.
The sceptic, in such a practical situation, believes, as a matter of fact, that he will
continue to receive TV programming several days into the future. Similarly, when
the sceptic purchases a carton of milk from a supermarket he believes that there is
milk in the carton, and he would be quite surprised to ﬁnd that it contained anything
else. The sceptic drives to work with the belief that the building in which he works
still exists, and that he was not ﬁred overnight. Upon reﬂection of these examples it
seems that in order doubt something, one must take a great many things for granted.
One can only doubt a proposition with respect to some background knowledge that
one takes for granted, which implies that total scepticism is an incoherent view.
A more modest sceptic would perhaps say that he does not doubt that some
proposition is true, but that he merely refrains from believing any propositions.
However, in practical situations, as we have seen, even the modest sceptic would
act as if he does believe some propositions to be true. Thus even the most
compromising of sceptics behaves as if he believes, in all practicality, a great
number of propositions. Since there are very good reasons to hold that both habitual
and deliberate actions are based on beliefs, independently of their expression, there
26
2
Knowledge

are very good reasons to believe that the sceptic believes a great many propositions,
despite his assurances to the contrary.
In summary, we attribute to ourselves a great deal of knowledge; albeit, some of
which, unbeknownst to us, is not actually knowledge by virtue of being false. This
is the basis of the provisional nature of knowledge: since we do not know which of
those propositions we call knowledge is false, we must be prepared to rethink
everything, even though we have good reasons to believe that most of what we take
ourselves to know is true.
2.3.2
Good Reasons for P
What constitutes good reasons for a proposition P depends on the kind of proposi-
tion P is. We can broadly distinguish three different types of propositions that are
justiﬁed in completely different ways: (i) mathematical, (ii) observational, and (iii)
theoretical. The line between observational and theoretical propositions is a con-
troversial issue that shall be left for later (The dependence of observational prop-
ositions on theory will be discussed in Sect. 4.4).
(i) To give good reasons for believing a mathematical proposition is to give a
proof. If a mathematical proposition has not been proven, then there is not
sufﬁcient reason to believe it is true.
(ii) It is less clear what constitutes good reason to believe observational proposi-
tions. In everyday situations, the fact that the person who is making the claim
saw the relevant event take place is often considered a good reason for us
believing him. However, anyone can make a mistake when it comes to one’s
observations, and we often delude ourselves. Richard Wiseman discusses
these things in his Paranormality.
In a court of law a single direct witness of a person committing a crime will
often not sufﬁce to prove a case. An interesting example is the Court of
Appeal’s treatment of Lisbet Palme’s designation of Christer Pettersson as
her husband’s killer. The prime minister of Sweden, Olof Palme, had been
shot by a gunman at the centre of Stockholm 1986, and Christer Pettersson was
tried for the murder and convicted in the ﬁrst instance. But the circumstances
of her identiﬁcation of this person were such that there was reasonable doubt;
and therefore Pettersson was acquitted by the court of appeal on account of
lack of evidence.
However, if several unconnected people had observed the shooting, and all
these people were of sound mind and in circumstances favourable for reliable
observation of this kind of incident, then their collective testimony would have
been enough to count as good reason for believing Pettersson guilty of the
crime.
Whereas a single person’s testimony often fails to sufﬁce in a court of law,
often the testimony of a single scientist is taken to sufﬁce as good reason to
2.3
The Deﬁnition of Propositional Knowledge
27

believe some result in the sciences. For example, one scientist’s observation of
a measurement on an instrument is sometimes considered a good reason for
believing that the observational proposition is true. But, of course, we cannot
completely dismiss the possibility of fraud or mistake.
(iii) What constitutes a good reason for believing a theoretical proposition is far
more difﬁcult to say. Indeed, one could say without too much fear of contra-
diction by one’s peers that the most discussed question in the philosophy of
science regards precisely this issue: under which conditions is a scientiﬁc
theory sufﬁciently strong for commanding general conﬁdence? This question
will be the central topic of the next chapter.
This criterion for knowledge–good reasons for believing a proposition is true–is
perhaps the least controversial as a general condition. If a person believes some
proposition P, which happens to be true, but cannot give good reasons for his
conﬁdence in the truth of P, then we would hardly say that this person knows
P. Instead we would perhaps call it ‘hearsay’, or that ‘he is just repeating what he
heard’.
2.3.3
What Does It Mean to Believe That P?
To believe that a proposition is true is the mental aspect of the concept of
knowledge. Notice that belief is not essentially religious. All people believe a
large number of different things about the weather, the future and themselves.
Belief is a mental state, similar to hope, doubt, etc.: i.e., it is a propositional
attitude. (See Chap. 12).
It would be completely unnatural to say of a person that he knows that P, yet does
not believe that P. In particular, if we accept the rest of Plato’s deﬁnition of
knowledge, this would amount to our claiming that he has good reason to
believe P, yet he does not believe P. How could this be rational? (The philosopher
G. E. Moore once remarked that it is paradoxical to say: It’s raining, but I don’t
believe it.)
Note also that this criterion implies that if we want to say that an animal, or
machine, has (propositional) knowledge, we must ascribe to that animal, or
machine, beliefs concerning, for example, its immediate surroundings. There are
various views on this subject: some think that there are no principal differences
between humans and animals in that at least some animals are capable of belief,
whereas others think that only humans are capable of belief. Additionally, even if
one ascribes beliefs to animals, it does not follow that animals can have proposi-
tional knowledge, i.e., knowledge that is transmitted through language. The most
reasonable view is, it seems, that animals only have non-propositional knowledge
(skills). Even if we can ‘speak’ to dogs and various other animals, it is doubtful that
what we teach them by ‘speaking’ to them is the kind of knowledge that we humans
acquire when we read a book or listen to a lecture.

Knowledge

Can computers have knowledge? Can they have beliefs? In today’s world it does
not seem reasonable to say that computers could have these capabilities. What
would we say about a futuristic computer that is capable of anthropomorphic
behaviour? Would we still say that there is a principal difference between humans
and computers? This is a controversial question within AI (Artiﬁcial Intelligence)
research as well as within the philosophy of mind, and there is little consensus
among the various researchers and philosophers. The only thing that can be said, in
general, is that if we want to retain Plato’s deﬁnition of knowledge whilst allowing
for future machines having knowledge, then we would also have to allow for future
machines having ‘beliefs’. On the other hand, if we think that computers are in
principle incapable of having beliefs, and if we want to retain Plato’s deﬁnition of
knowledge, then we must hold that computers are likewise incapable of knowledge,
irrespective of their performance.
For many it is obvious that computers cannot believe, have knowledge or think;
and that these abilities are uniquely human. However, we should note that whenever
we say that a person believes something, knows something, or is intelligent, that we
do so on the basis of her apparent behaviour. We cannot, after all, observe a
person’s mental processes. If we were to use the same criteria (in terms of observed
behaviour) when considering whether a computer can have knowledge as we do
when considering whether a human can have knowledge, then it seems that
computers could have knowledge, at least in principle. The English logician Alan
Turing (1912–1954) formulated this idea as the Turing test, which is a criterion for
intelligent, human behaviour. The Turing test is carried out in the following way:
suppose you type questions on a keyboard that is in some unknown way (for you)
connected to other devices. The printer then prints out the answers to your ques-
tions. You are allowed to ask whatever you want and as many questions as you
please. If you are unable to tell whether it is a human or a machine that is answering
the questions, and it is a machine that is answering, then that machine is exhibiting
human mental capacities. That is to say, the machine in question has knowledge and
it can think.
This test falls short of any generally accepted criteria for thought. But those who
reject it are faced with two options: either they must construct some other criteria
for thought, or else maintain that rational thought is a uniquely human capacity. If
one takes the latter view, then, of course, every such test to see if a machine can
think is completely misguided.
In summary, we have discussed one of the most widely accepted deﬁnitions of
knowledge. Application of this deﬁnition has brought with it various consequences
as regards our parlance. The point of this discussion is partly to promote a well
thought out and consistent use of the concept of (propositional) knowledge, and
partly to clarify the relationship between knowledge, truth, justiﬁcation and belief.
2.3
The Deﬁnition of Propositional Knowledge
29

2.4
Can One Know Without Knowing that One Knows?
A common argument against the requirement that knowledge must be true is the
following: since you admit that in many situations you cannot be sure that a
proposition P is true, even if P is true, then you do not know that you know P;
and thus you do not know P. This is a logical mistake. The argument has the
following form:
1. If X knows that P, then X knows that X knows that P.
2. It is not the case that X knows that X knows that P.
Therefore,
It is not the case that X knows that P.
The mistake is in the second premise. The content of the claim that one knows
that one knows that P is that
•
One believes that one knows that P,
•
One has good reasons for saying that one knows that P and
•
It is true that one knows that P.
The ﬁrst criterion is plausibly met; if a certain person, X, knows P, then P is a
justiﬁed, true belief of X. It follows that if one attributes to X minimal capacities of
self-reﬂection, then it is reasonable to suppose that X believes she know
P. Similarly, one can say that she has good reasons for saying that she knows
P. But is it true that X knows P? Yes, if P is true, X believes P and is justiﬁed in
believing P, then X knows P. But this is the same as saying that it is true that X
knows P. Thus one can say that one knows that one knows P, even though one has
no sure method to determine whether P is true. It is, in fact, enough that P is true.
In addition, it is a controversial question whether premise 1 is a valid principle;
many claim that it is a logical truth, (an axiom in epistemic logic) while others
doubt this claim. The critics do not want to doubt that in individual cases it can be
correct to say that if one knows P, then one knows that one knows P, but they do
doubt that the principle holds for all cases. The dispute is about how to formalize
the logical principles of the concept of knowing. Those who doubt that premise 1 is
a valid principle have another argument against the claim that one does not know a
proposition when one lacks a guarantee of the propositions truth.
2.5
Reliabilism
The conception of knowledge as justiﬁed true belief has been questioned the recent
decades. The seminal paper in this development was a short paper by Edmund
Gettier, ‘Is knowledge justiﬁed true belief?’ (1963). He constructed a couple of
examples where the three conditions for knowledge are clearly fulﬁlled, but yet we
still would be unwilling to say that the proposition under discussion was known by
30
2
Knowledge

the speaker. This suggests that the three conditions are not sufﬁcient and that some
amendment is needed. But, alas, all efforts to add something have failed due to the
additional clause excluding whole categories of propositions that we would recog-
nize as clear examples of knowledge.
It has become increasingly clear that the problem is not truth, not belief, but
justiﬁcation: more precisely, justiﬁcation of empirical propositions. This has
inspired an increasing number of epistemologists to replace justiﬁcation with a
more descriptive condition, viz., that the beliefs called ‘knowledge’ have been
arrived at using a reliable procedure; thus the label ‘reliabilism’. The general idea
is that whether a person can be said to know a proposition P or not, does not depend
on him being able to produce good reasons, but whether he in fact used a method for
arriving at his belief that has proven reliable. Which methods should qualify as
reliable is currently under debate, but the tendency is clear: a lot of people are
adopting some variant of reliabilism.
This trend is but one aspect of the naturalistic tendency in current epistemology,
viz., a rejection of the notion that epistemology can be an independent basis for the
other sciences. Naturalists view epistemology as an integral part of science, no
more basic than cognitive psychology for example. The interested reader may
consult Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy/knowledge – analysis (http://plato.
stanford.edu).
Some authors e.g. Luciano Floridi (2011) claim that the Gettier problem cannot,
as a matter of principle, be solved. Floridi’s conclusion is to focus attention on the
concept of information instead; this is more basic than the concept of knowledge.
2.6
Data, Information, Knowledge
It seems that scientiﬁc knowledge in many areas, e.g., in palaeontology, genetics
and medicine, is increasing with an ever-increasing pace. New technologies in
e.g. DNA sequencing and new possibilities to store, retrieve and analyse enormous
amounts of data has made it possible to gain knowledge in areas previously
believed to be inaccessible.
Using modern technology it is possible to collect data, transform data sets to
information and then arrive at more knowledge. Such processes have always been
important in science, but with the rapid development of computers and computer
technology it has come to centre stage in some sciences. Therefore the relations
between the three concepts, data, information and knowledge, deserve some
scrutiny.
Some philosophers, the ﬁrst being Kant (as far as I know) observed that the
concept of information is somehow more basic than that of knowledge. In modern
times Gareth Evans made the same observation, according to Michael Dummett:
Evans had the idea that there is a much cruder and more fundamental concept than that of
knowledge on which philosophers have concentrated so much, namely the concept of
information. Information is conveyed by perception, and retained by memory, though
2.6
Data, Information, Knowledge
31

also transmitted by means of language. One needs to concentrate on that concept before one
approaches that of knowledge, in the proper sense. Information is acquired, for example,
without one’s necessarily having a grasp of the proposition which embodies it; the ﬂow of
information operates at a much more basic level than the acquisition and transformation of
knowledge. I think that the conception deserves to be explored. It’s not one that ever
occurred to me before I read Evans, but it is probably fruitful. That also distinguishes this
work very sharply from traditional epistemology. (Dummett 1993, p. 186)
But what more precisely is the relation between information and knowledge?
The ﬁrst thing to notice is that the word ‘information’ is used in, at least, three
distinct senses. The ﬁrst sense is semantic information. We use the ‘information’ in
this sense in the following examples:
•
‘The study counsellor informed the student about the job prospects for lawyers.’
•
‘The allied forces during WWII collected information about German plans by
decoding their encrypted messages.’
•
‘By studying the map carefully we got information about the best way to drive.’
In these examples the information talked about can be expressed as complete
meaningful sentences, which is why it is called semantic information.
It has been some debate concerning the veracity of semantic information; must it
be true or not? It is now a general consensus that false information is no real
information. False information can be compared with counterfeit, i.e. fake money.
Fake money is no real money and similarly false information is no information. The
reason is that in neither case can it (false information or counterfeit) be used for
what it is supposed to be used for. Money is used for buying things, and false money
cannot be used for buying anything, it is worthless. (If you succeed in getting an
item by using counterfeit, you did not really pay; you deluded the seller, and hence
you did not buy the item.) Information is used for making plans and decisions in
order to achieve our goals. But false information is useless for this, or worse.
In both cases we may be unaware of the real state of affairs. We may mistakenly
believe that some piece of information is true and make decisions based on this. The
risk of failure in such a case is much higher than if we had true information.
Similarly, we may be unaware that a note in our possession is counterfeit and we
try to use it for a purchase. Clearly, the risk of failure in our endeavour is higher
than if it was real money; we are even in danger of being accused of being aware
about the counterfeit and prosecuted.
It may be observed that semantic information need not be linguistic items. A
map contains geographic information using a lot of symbols, lines, dots, curves, etc.
By interpreting these symbols we can formulate sentences that express information
contained in the map.
The second sense of information is usually called ‘Shannon Information’ after
the seminal work of Shannon and Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Informa-
tion (1949). In this book they conceived information as a quantity. They studied the
question how much information that can be transmitted from a sender through a
cable to a receiver without distortion. In their resulting communication theory they
deﬁned information in terms of probability. The basic idea is that the amount of
32
2
Knowledge

information in a message is higher the less probable the sequence of signs
is. Information in this sense may be called negentropy, i.e. the opposite to entropy.
Shannon information is the intended sense in the following sentences:
•
‘My memory stick can store 16 GB information’,
•
‘The ﬂow of information operates at a much more basic level than the acquisition
and transformation of knowledge.’ (Dummett quote above)
The third sense of ‘information’ is somewhat similar to semantic information,
but where information is said to be contained or stored in a system without any
higher cognitive capacities. Consider these examples:
•
Our DNA contains information about hereditary traits.
•
Migrating birds spending the winter in Africa obtain information about the time
for ﬂying to northern countries from the length of the day.
•
My computer got information that a new version of the virus protection
programme was available.
In such cases there is no mind involved. We might say that in these cases it is
systems with feedback mechanisms that under certain inputs perform a certain
output, and we call the input ‘information’ because it can be described in functional
terms. We would not say that these systems obtain knowledge about the conditions;
but we ﬁnd it natural to say that they obtain information and perform certain
operations as a result of the information.
But why call the input ‘information’? The reason seems to be that we can
describe the input as being about something, often the state of the environment. It
has content. Or rather, when we humans describe the input and the workings of the
system we ﬁnd it natural to talk as if the information-containing system consciously
sent messages to us humans; we say that the systems obtain information, transmit
information or store information about something, as if it were like a human mind.
The core feature of this use of the word ‘information’ is thus its aboutness, its
intentionality. This notion will be further discussed in Chap. 5.
Finally data. It is common in computer science to say that information is data
with meaning. This is ok as far as it goes, but what is ‘meaning’? And how do data
acquire meaning? It seems that minimally it means that meaningful data becomes
information when we have been able to formulate declarative sentences expressing
the information that is obtained from a data set.
Almost anything can be data. In order to obtain data from e.g. a story, from light
from distant stars, or from the result of an experiment, we need to divide the stream
of sounds, lights, or states of detectors into distinct items. When using written text
as data source one must divide the string of linguistic signs into distinct items, such
as words or longer or shorter expressions. Radiation from universe may be divided
according to position (using a coordinate system for identifying position in the sky)
and frequency distribution for example. Detector states, clearly distinct from each
other, must be deﬁned before any meaningful measurement can be done. In short, in
order to obtain a data set, we need to deﬁne a principle for dividing up something
into distinct pieces. Hence from a conceptual point of view, discerning data and
2.6
Data, Information, Knowledge
33

collecting a data set presupposes that we have a prior principle of making distinc-
tions within a phenomenon. And making distinctions is always driven by pre-
suppositions about what might be relevant and not for the research question.
Sometimes we have lot of background knowledge from start, for example when
studying the cosmic background radiation it seems obvious to sort data according to
intensity and frequency in different directions. But in other cases it is far from
obvious: listening or reading a story in order to collect empirical data there is no
obvious way of transforming this story to a data set. Should we count frequencies of
certain expressions? Should we look for grammatical forms? Should we study the
order of types of expressions? It depends on purpose, of course.
The ﬁrst sense of ‘information’ is that which is most close to what we mean by
‘knowledge’. Knowledge and semantic information can be expressed as true state-
ments being about something. One could say that semantic information is the
proper concept when we talk about the content of knowledge states of humans,
but disregard that these knowledge states are mind states or whether the subject can
produce good reasons for the content of his belief. One could say that semantic
information is that which is expressed by the sentence p when we say of a person
that she knows that p. In short, a piece of knowledge is a piece of information for
which the knower can provide good reasons.
2.7
The Philosopher’s Versus the Sociologist’s Concept
of Knowledge
The discussion has hitherto been about what one ought to call knowledge. Claiming
that the correct meaning of the expression ‘X knows that P’ is that P is a true,
justiﬁed belief of X is stating a norm. However, one can take a totally different
perspective by applying a more sociologically oriented approach. Accordingly,
knowledge is seen as merely that which humans within a particular society call
knowledge. This means that one places ‘true’ and ‘considered true’ on the same
footing. If one were to change the societal perspective, then what was knowledge
may no longer be considered knowledge. There are two immediate interpretations
of this sociological perspective. The ﬁrst is that it is merely another version of
relativism, in the sense that what a culture holds to be knowledge is knowledge, and
there is no way of distinguishing between real knowledge and what is taken to be
knowledge. The second interpretation is that sociologists are operating with another
concept of knowledge, ‘what a certain culture considers to be knowledge’, and that
they do not take a stance as to whether it is actually knowledge or not, or even
whether it is possible to make a distinction between knowledge and what is taken to
be knowledge. It may seem a legitimate viewpoint for a sociologist to be agnostic
when it comes to this question, since sociology is not philosophy. However, if this
agnosticism is universalized, then it becomes applicable to those propositions the
sociologists themselves produce, and we are led to ask whether the sociologist’s
34
2
Knowledge

claims are supposed to be true regardless of culture, or are they merely opinions
within his research group, discipline, university or society? Suppose that the
sociologist answers that the latter alternative is the case, which he ought to do,
since the ﬁrst alternative leads to inconsistency in the sociologist’s view. Then we
ask ourselves, what is the point of his research? Does he want to solicit his own
cultural domain? It is obvious that total relativism eventually leads to a complete
surrender of any distinction between scientiﬁc argumentation and propaganda; or,
for that matter, between science and religious dogma. But some restricted form of
relativism, where some inquiries are viewed as resulting in objective knowledge,
whereas others are held to express mere opinions, is possible.
Helen Longino has in her (2002) discussed these matters. She argues that the
dichotomy between the rational and the social aspects of knowledge depends on
some presuppositions that can be refuted.
A number of sociologists, for example Bruno Latour, have introduced the norm
that sociologists ought to study societies and groups without taking a stance as to
whether the claims of those societies are true or not: one should be impartial. This
may seem to be a sympathetic view; that one should not act as a know-it-all and
dictate as to who is right or wrong. If one agrees with this norm, then it follows that
one cannot, in principle, distinguish between what is considered knowledge in the
society under study and what actually is knowledge. This implies that one cannot
appeal to factual circumstances when one wants to explain something within the
society or culture being studied. Among other things, this means that one cannot
explain the results of various decisions or behaviour by saying, for example, that it
was based on a misunderstanding, since the idea of a misunderstanding presupposes
the distinction between truth and falsity. This is, in all practicality, an unreasonable
position.
2.8
The Expression ‘It Is True for Me that. . .’
One sometimes hears people say that something is ‘true for me’, or ‘it is true for
her’. Obviously one wants to say something more than that he or she believes the
proposition in question, otherwise, one would simply say that ‘I believe that. . .’, or
‘I believe that. . .is true’. When one says that ‘. . .is true’, it is because one wants to
claim something stronger; namely, that one’s claim is not just a private opinion, but
also that it is objectively true. So what is being said when one adds ‘for me’? One
gets the impression that the speaker initially wants to claim something more than a
private opinion, but then later signals a retraction when he adds ‘for me’. Thus,
uttering the expression ‘it is true for me’ seems to be a pragmatic inconsistency.
One is both making and taking back the claim that the utterance is objectively true.
There are, however, situations where the expression ‘it is true for me’ can be
given a reasonable interpretation. I am thinking of a case where one talks about how
one experiences a situation and wants to assert priority of one’s own experience. An
2.8
The Expression ‘It Is True for Me that. . .’
35

example is the discussion that followed the publication of Jan Myrdal’s4 autobio-
graphical books Childhood and Twelve Going on Thirteen. In these books, Myrdal,
a well-known Swedish author with well-known parents, presents his mother in a
very unfavourable light. Myrdal describes himself as a boy longing for his mother’s
love and attention, which he hardly ever gets. Since his books came out, Myrdal’s
sisters have also published autobiographies in which Myrdal is presented as a
terribly egoistic boy, who is always jealously manoeuvring to get his mother’s
undivided attention. In response to these claims Myrdal answered, ‘It is my truth
that I describe in my books.’
This answer is impossible to criticize. The only thing one can say is that it would
have shown a sign of impartiality and self-awareness if this phrasing had been more
clearly presented in his books. For example, Myrdal could have written, ‘I experi-
enced my mother as being false’, instead of the infamous ‘she was as false as a
three-crown coin’. However, Myrdal can defend himself in that, in his books, he
pointed out that it is his personal perspective that is being presented.
This example shows that, when the question regards how one should describe a
social situation, one cannot ignore how the situation is experienced by those
involved. One could, perhaps, defend Myrdal’s parents with the argument that
they did not in any obvious way deviate from the accepted norms of childcare of
the time and culture, but this does not sufﬁce. Suppose that Myrdal, with respect to
both past and present day norms, was a horribly self-absorbed person, and that his
parents engaged with him more than usual at that time. Would this imply that we
could claim that he was wrong to portray his mother as such a mean and uncaring
person in the description of his childhood experience? No, hardly. Questions
regarding how an event is experienced and how some event actually unfolded
are, in this case, the same question. The objective reality we want to describe is
precisely how different people perceive their relations to one another.
There is reason here to make a distinction between two different senses of the
objective-subjective contrast. The ﬁrst sense is epistemological. It is that a claim is
objectively true, or objectively false, if the truth or falsity of that claim does not
depend on who makes the claim. Another sense of the objective-subjective contrast
is ontological. A phenomenon, circumstance, event or object, in short, anything we
can talk about, is objective in the ontological sense if its existence is independent of
any individual’s mental states. Otherwise, it is ontologically subjective. A person’s
attitudes, feelings and thoughts are subjective in the ontological sense. It follows
that one can make objectively true or false claims about these phenomena, i.e.,
about subjective experiences.
What is the criterion for truth when we ask, ‘what was the relationship between
Jan Myrdal and his mother?’ The only reasonable answer is to say that the truth
about the relationship between mother and son, in this case, has to do with precisely
4 Jan Myrdal, born 1927, is in Sweden a well-known author and son of Gunnar and Alva Myrdal,
both being well-known to the public. Gunnar Myrdal was awarded the nobel prize in economics
1974 and Alva Myrdal was active in the peace movement and member of the Swedish government.
36

the feelings they both had. If Myrdal actually had the feelings he purports to have
had, then nothing more is required. It is an entirely separate question whether our
memories of our feelings long ago are reliable. (It is well known that often they are
not, but in this example I neglect this aspect.)
The question regarding what was actually the case is often connected to the
question of what is responsible for Jan Myrdal’s feelings of abandonment? Was it
his mother’s actions, or his own excessive need for attention?
The supplementary question ‘Who is to blame?’ shows that values play a
substantial role when we describe social situations. It is yet another sign that one,
on a conceptual basis, can hardly describe a social situation without making a value
judgment. We usually distinguish between propositions regarding facts and prop-
ositions regarding values (propositions that express moral, judicial or aesthetic
norms, as in when something is good, bad, right, wrong, beautiful, etc.) in that we
usually say that propositions regarding facts are true or false, whereas propositions
regarding values do not, at least on some views, have this property. Thus the
conclusion is that in describing social relations, we often cannot distinguish
between fact and value judgment on the basis that the concepts we use are more
or less impregnated with values. The example of Jan Myrdal’s relationship with his
mother is typical in that the concepts used to talk about human relations, concepts
such as ‘unloving’ and ‘egocentric’, are both descriptive and evaluative. In short,
there hardly exist any concepts that are such that we can describe a social phenom-
enon without expressing values.
A means to attain the highest level of objectivity possible in describing social
relations is to introduce a reference to a certain person’s perspective. When we say
that ‘Jan Myrdal’s mother neglected him’ it sounds like an objective and, in
principle, observable fact. But a more precise expression of the fact alluded to
would clearly state that the situation regards particular experiences: ‘Jan Myrdal
experienced that his mother neglected him’. This reformulation is perhaps not a big
step forward as regards determining the fact of the matter, but it does make clear the
context of the situation; namely, how a relationship is experienced. Thus if someone
says ‘this is true for me’, and by this means ‘this is how I experience the situation’,
then there is nothing here to criticize, save perhaps that the expression hides an
allusion to private experience. However, it should be noted that such propositions
are true or false in the usual sense of ‘stating it as it is’. Either it is the case that
Myrdal had such an experience and the proposition is true, or it is the case that he
did not and he has lied, or incorrectly remembered. If the latter, then the proposition
is false. That it might be impossible for us to determine which is the case is
irrelevant.

Knowledge of Religious Beliefs
It is sometimes claimed that one can indeed have knowledge of something without
believing that something. An example of this is religious belief. Consider the belief
that Jesus is God’s son. One is here mixing together two very different things. If I
say, ‘I know that Jesus is God’s son’, then I cannot claim that I do not believe it,
since ‘I know’ implies ‘I believe’. Though, one can simultaneously hold that
‘According to the Christian religion, Jesus is God’s son’ and ‘I do not believe
Jesus is God’s son’. In other words, I can have knowledge of what the Christian
religion claims and the various beliefs that Christians hold, without holding those
beliefs myself. I do not then know that Jesus is God’s son, but rather I merely know
what certain other people believe.
The above example is merely a special case of the trivial fact that we can have
(true) knowledge of what someone believes, even if the content of those beliefs is
not believed by us, or are simply false.
2.10
Summary
The classical deﬁnition of knowledge is that it is a true justiﬁed belief. In other
words, knowledge is a state of mind that is about the world, that it is true and such
that good reasons can be given for the content of the belief. One may say that the
concept of knowledge connects the subjective, the intersubjective and the objective
aspect of a state of mind.
We accept in all empirical sciences, in everyday life and in the courts that a piece
of evidence could be very good reason for a belief without providing a complete
guarantee for truth. Hence, since there is no strict connection between good reason
and truth, it may happen that we have very good reason for a false belief. And
further, Gettier discovered that we may have good reasons for a true belief, but we
still do not want to say that that belief constitutes knowledge; we believe the
proposition for the wrong reason, it seems. This has inspired many philosophers
to suggest an alternative deﬁnition of knowledge, viz. that it is a true belief, which is
arrived at by a reliable procedure. The point is that the person who is attributed a
piece of knowledge may not know that he/she in fact used a reliable process. The
reasons he/she may give for the belief is not relevant.
So what is knowledge? Philosophers disagree; but they do not disagree about the
truth-condition; a false belief cannot be knowledge.

ﬁnds a wallet containing a driver’s license that belongs to a Pelle Persson. The
detective seeks him out and discovers that Pelle Persson left town in a hurry. It
just so happens that Pelle Persson has long been in conﬂict with the victim and
had much to gain from the victim’s death. Pelle Persson is arrested; under his

ﬁngernails the police ﬁnd traces of the victim’s blood. The police also ﬁnd a
large number of ﬁngerprints belonging to Pelle Persson at the scene of the crime.
There are no other suspects; and so Carl Blomkvist becomes convinced that
Pelle Persson is the murderer.
In fact, Pelle Persson is not the murderer. Another person is, and he has
succeeded in simultaneously hiding his involvement and framing Pelle Persson.
Does Carl Blomkvist know that Pelle Persson is the murderer?
2. In the 1500s, the geocentric worldview was still the established view. Among
other things, this worldview enabled seafarers to determine their latitude when
sailing on the open ocean by reference to the positions of the sun and other
celestial bodies. Even though their worldview was not correct, their latitudinal
calculations were.
When such a seafarer correctly believes that his latitude is x degrees on the
basis of the instruments and techniques of the day, does he know it?
3. Lady G is on a walk in the inner city of London and is thinking about classic
rock’n roll. She sees a man on a street corner that she has seen on TV many
times, as well as in the newspapers. However, he looks a bit older than he did in
the pictures she saw. She stares intently at the person and says to herself, ‘My
God, that is Elvis Presley! I saw him!’
In actuality, what Lady G tells herself is true. Elvis Presley is in fact living a
quiet life in London, and it was just this person that she has met. However, at the
time of this occurrence there is an Elvis Presley look-alike competition going on
in London, so the city is crawling with Elvis impersonators. This event is well
known and all over the tabloids, but Lady G does not read those papers and has
no idea that the competition is taking place.
Does Lady G know that she saw Elvis Presley?
4. Doctor H prescribes medicine M to a patient P. This medicine has been carefully
tested and has been used for 20 years with a 100 % success rate, and no side

medicine M works. It is a complete mystery.
Does Doctor H know that the patient will be cured?

(a)
A proposition can be true even though everyone thinks that it is false.

Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing
We and other animals notice what goes on around us. This
helps us by suggesting what we might expect and event how
to prevent it, and thus fosters survival. However, the
expedient works only imperfectly. There are surprises, and
they are unsettling. How can we tell when we are right? We
are faced with the problem of error.

Introduction
What does it mean that an activity, or argument, is scientiﬁc? Is there any single
criterion that the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities must fulﬁl in
order to be called science? Many have answered ‘no’, on the basis that the natural
sciences and the human sciences are fundamentally two different enterprises. One
central argument for this view, offered by Dilthey1 and Weber,2 is that the natural
sciences and the cultural sciences (which was their term for human and most social
sciences) have different purposes: the purpose of the natural sciences is the expla-
nation of natural phenomena, whereas the purpose of the cultural sciences is the
understanding of human phenomena. Weber may be interpreted as holding that
explanation is causal explanation and understanding is discerning the meaning of
actions of individuals and collectives.
There are further differences between natural and cultural science, which we
shall discuss in detail in Chap. 5; but despite the differences there are also
similarities. In my opinion, there is a common denominator, a deﬁning trait, of all
that is properly called science, and it is our task here to identify it.
Is there a point to ﬁnding a good deﬁnition of science? Yes, and for at least two
important reasons. Firstly, there is a need to distinguish between science and
pseudo-science: the latter being activities that claim to be scientiﬁc but upon closer
analysis prove to be based on wishful thinking, fraud, business interests or pure
1 Willhelm Dilthey (1833–1911), German philosopher and historian who helped develop German
idealism. He saw cultural phenomena as objectiﬁcations of people’s mental lives.
2 Max Weber (1864–1920), German sociologist, historian and philosopher. According to Weber,
the purpose of sociology is to understand the meaning and/or values expressed in human action.

superstition. In particular, it is essential for the medical ﬁeld to be able to clearly
distinguish between medical science and quackery. In public debate, success stories
are often reported regarding things like homeopathy, herbal remedies, healing, etc.
Even if one may sometimes believe in these success stories, the central question is
whether that success was the result of the remedying method or some extraneous
circumstances. Thus it can be of great value to be able to distinguish scientiﬁc
methods from non-scientiﬁc, as only with scientiﬁc methods is there a reasonable
chance that the conclusions one draws are true and can be generalized.
The other reason for discussing criteria for science is to make possible an
understanding of the immense transformations that we call the scientiﬁc and
industrial revolutions. These revolutions began a line of research that has since
then accelerated to an amazing pace. If we can ﬁnd a satisfying characterization of
what science is, then we can better understand how the propagation of science
works, as well as further our understanding of a central component of our own
society’s transformation.
3.2
Unity of Science?
What is the common characteristic of all the activities that we call science? The
naive answer would be that science discovers new things and increases our knowl-
edge. An immediate rebuttal to this characterization is the fact that, in the future,
presumably some of our present scientiﬁc beliefs will sooner or later prove to be
mistaken. We cannot know now what is amiss with our present beliefs (for then we
would not believe they were knowledge); but it is quite reasonable to believe that at
least some part of what we now believe will later turn out to be false. If we claim
that the criterion for scientiﬁc research is that it increases our knowledge, we would
be forced to say that some of what we now call research, though we do not know
which part, is not actually research (since it does not guarantee knowledge).
However, to condemn some part of scientiﬁc research after the fact is not partic-
ularly productive. What we need is a criterion for science and research that we can
use without it being necessary to know exactly what is true or false. Therefore, the
most common view among philosophers is that criteria for science should be
formulated in terms of methods and not in terms of results. This means that a
certain enterprise can count as science even though it later turns out that the theories
this enterprise put forward are not quite correct. It also means that an enterprise that
results in true propositions is not necessarily scientiﬁc; they could be arrived at
merely by coincidence.
We come thus to the following central question: is there some common method
used by all the sciences that can stand as a criterion, or even the criterion, for
science? In response to this question, one can identify three possible answers.
Some rather cynical people would answer no: there is no such common property
that distinguishes science from other activities. According to this cynical view,
42
3
Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

what is called ‘science’ is arbitrary and the label is primarily used for enhancing the
prestige of the enterprise so labelled.
According to another rather common view, inspired by Weber, scientiﬁc
research is that which is typically practiced in universities, and there need be no
signiﬁcant similarity between all of these research enterprises beyond this. There is
one crucial difference between the natural and cultural sciences, which is that the
natural and cultural sciences use essentially different methods. The central activity
of the cultural sciences is interpretation: interpretation of texts, events, actions,
assertions, institutions, artefacts, etc. Such interpretation always contains a subjec-
tive element, as any interpretation must be based on the interpreter’s prior under-
standing and cultural background. This in turn implies that interpretation is, in
principle, not totally objective: i.e., not independent of individual perspective and
culture. In contrast, in the natural sciences it is possible to be strictly objective in
describing the phenomena one is studying in that two researchers can agree on an
observation, irrespective of the cultural or theoretical background they might have.
Natural and cultural science are, according to this view, essentially different, and
the fact that we call both types of enterprise ‘science’ does not imply that they share
a method in common. On this view, those enterprises that do not fall into one of
these groups, each of which is characterized by its methods, are deemed pseudo-
sciences and hence are not sciences at all.
According to a third much disputed view, there is a least common denominator
for everything that deserves the labels ‘science’ and/or ‘research’. This is my view.
The common denominator is the hypothetical-deductive method. Every enterprise
that has the right to call itself science applies some variation of this method, though
the details may differ from case to case. The hypothetical-deductive method,
according to this view, should be used as the criterion for science; if an activity,
taken in its entirety, does not abide by the requirements formulated in the
hypothetical-deductive method, then it should be classiﬁed as a pseudo-science. I
favour this third view.
Against those who claim that the cultural and natural sciences are fundamentally
different, one may reply that the core activity of the major part of the cultural
sciences–interpretation of texts, actions, and historical events–can be viewed as a
sort of hypothesis testing where the interpretations play the role of hypotheses.
These ‘hypotheses’ are tested against the types of evidence forthcoming in the texts,
events, artefacts, etc. I shall explain this idea further in Sect. 3.5.
3.3
Hypothetical-Deductive Method
In order to more precisely describe what the hypothetical-deductive method is, I
shall discuss a couple of examples from the history of science.
Example 1. The rejection of abiogenesis
3.3
Hypothetical-Deductive Method
43

For a long time people thought that worms, larva, etc. came into being sponta-
neously, rather than through the reproductive activity of parents. The idea was that
these types of organisms were generated by decaying plant and animal matter. This
idea is not entirely unreasonable given everyday observations of the natural world.
Indeed, if one digs up a shovel’s worth of topsoil, which is composed of plants in
various stages of decomposition, one ﬁnds that it contains a large variety of small
animals such as centipedes, spiders, larva, etc. (the existence of millions of organ-
isms invisible to the human eye was, of course, not known in the mid 1600s or
earlier). This view – theory is perhaps too pretentious a word – is called abiogenesis
and was widely accepted up until the mid 1600s. However, a doctor from Florence
named Francesco Redi (1621–1697) came to doubt abiogenesis. He tells (1668)
how he
. . ..began to believe that all worms found in meat were derived directly from the droppings
of ﬂies, and not from the putrefaction of the meat, and I was still more conﬁrmed in this
belief by having observed that, before the meat grew wormy, ﬂies had hovered over it, of
the same kind as those that later bred in it. Belief would be vain without the conﬁrmation of
experiment, hence in the middle of July I put a snake, some ﬁsh, some eels of the Arno, and
a slice of milk-fed veal in four large wide-mouthed ﬂasks; having well closed and sealed
them, I then ﬁlled the same number of ﬂasks in the same way, only leaving these open. It
was not long before the meat and the ﬁsh, in these second vessels, became wormy and ﬂies
were seen entering and leaving at will; but in the closed ﬂasks I did not see a worm, though
many days had passed since the dead ﬂesh had been put in them. . . ..
To remove all doubt, as the trial had been made with closed vessels into which the air
could not penetrate or circulate, I wished to attempt a new experiment by putting meat and
ﬁsh in a large vase closed only with a ﬁne Naples veil, that allowed the air to enter. For
further protection against ﬂies, I placed the vessel in a frame covered with the same net. I
never saw any worms in the meat, though many were to be seen moving about on the
net-covered frame.’ (p. 33 ff.)
After these experiments, Redi (and eventually many others) became convinced
that worms did not spontaneously arise (However, people continued to believe in
abiogenesis of microscopic organisms until Pasteur successfully falsiﬁed this view).
The structure of Redi’s argument is as follows: Redi begins by considering
abiogenesis as a hypothesis (H), which he proposes to falsify with an experiment.
We can formulate it as
(H) ‘Worms arise spontaneously, in the absence of living animals, when meat and
ﬁsh decompose.’
This is apparently one part of the abiogenesis view. From this hypothesis he
draws the following conclusion:
(E) ‘If I place meat and ﬁsh to rot in a covered jar, after a time I will be able to
observe worms in the meat and ﬁsh.’
We call this sentence an Empirical Consequence (E) since, (1) it is a logical
consequence of the hypothesis, and (2) its truth value can be decided by empirical
experiments: i.e., we can prepare a situation such that we can show, through
observation, whether the sentence is truth or false. Since the experiment shows
44
3
Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

the E is false, we must infer that the hypothesis is also false; because E is a direct
consequence of H. The reasoning can be formulated thus:
If H, then E
E false
H false
This is the age-old way of a displaying a logical argument; premises go above the
line and the conclusion is placed below.
Once we have formulated an argument in this fashion, it is easy to see whether
the argument displays logically valid reasoning: that regardless of what the letters
H and E stand for, the conclusion follows from the premises. Put another way, an
argument is valid only on the basis of its logical form, which in this case is called
modus tollens (see Appendix).
Have we now deﬁnitively proven that H is false? No, we have not. That the form
of an argument is valid means only that if we accept the premises, then we must
accept the conclusion. Thus we can still doubt the conclusion of a valid argument by
doubting the premises. In particular, if we read the latter part of Redi’s text, we see
that there is a possible objection to H. When Redi acknowledges that further
experiments are required to check that excluding the air in his initial experiments
did not unduly inhibit larval growth, he is indirectly saying that one can make the
following objection to his initial experiment: it neglected a necessary condition for
the production of larvae from rotting meat, namely the free circulation of air. This
condition is not met in the ﬁrst experiment. In this experiment, Redi tacitly assumed
that air circulation was inessential for the production of larvae in rotten meat. Such
a tacit assumption is commonly called an Auxiliary assumption (A). Thus it so
happens that there is a hidden premise in the argument:
(A) The production of worms in rotten meat and ﬁsh does not depend on air
circulation.
This auxiliary assumption is an essential step in the argument; and thus we
modify our logical formulation to include it:
If H and A, then E
Efalse
Either H or A is false
Consequently, H can no longer be disproved by the falsity of E: it is possible that H
is true and A is false. It was in order to exclude this possibility that Redi conducted
the second experiment, in which the auxiliary assumption is not used.
This experiment is a beautiful example of an application of the hypothetico-
deductive method. The term itself was not invented until modern times, but this way
of thinking had already begun to be applied during the scientiﬁc revolution.
3.3
Hypothetical-Deductive Method
45

We have here seen that it is possible to falsify a hypothesis given that one has
identiﬁed, and controlled, all auxiliary assumptions. But can one deﬁnitively
conﬁrm a hypothesis? This question leads directly to the next example.
Example 2. The link between diet and urine pH.
Claude Bernard (1813–1878)–a physiologist from Paris–conducted experimental
studies of various physiological properties of mammals. He discovered that carni-
vores have sour and clear urine, while herbivores have alkaline and turbid urine. This
apparent rule held without exception until he one day observed a deviation among
some rabbits that had recently arrived from a breeder. These rabbits had sour and
clear urine, even though rabbits are strictly herbivores and so should have alkaline
and turbid urine by the apparent rule. Thus there must have been something special
about these particular rabbits. This prompted Bernard to make the assumption that
these rabbits had been starved during transport to his laboratory. Starvation causes
the body to break down its own muscle tissue, which is the same as eating meat on
the metabolic level and hence would account for the clear and sour urine.
In order to test his hypothesis, Bernard performed a number of experiments. The
ﬁrst was to feed the rabbits their normal diet and observe their urine. The result was
that the rabbits’ urine became alkaline and turbid again. Then he proceeded to
observe the urine of starved horses and found that they also had clear and sour urine.
Bernard later dissected the starved rabbits in order to see if they had indeed
metabolized their own meat. After these various investigations, all of which
conﬁrmed his predictions, he was prepared to accept the hypothesis and claim
that he had found the explanation to why the newly bred rabbits produced unchar-
acteristic urine.
Now let us analyse the structure of this argument. It is obvious that the hypoth-
esis that Bernard decided to test is the following:
(H) Herbivores produce clear and sour urine when they fast.
This hypothesis was tested with respect to a general rule, or perhaps we should
call it a theory; namely, that herbivores’ urine is alkaline and turbid under normal
circumstances, whereas carnivores’ urine is clear and sour. This supporting theory
is required in order to draw to any testable empirical implications from the
hypothesis. As in the foregoing example, we can call this assumption, untested in
this experiment, an auxiliary assumption:
(A) Herbivores’ urine is normally alkaline and turbid, and carnivores’ urine is
normally clear and sour.
From these two premises, H and A, one can draw the following empirical
consequences (and probably many others):
(E1) Rabbits with clear and sour urine produce alkaline and turbid urine when fed
grass.
(E2) Horses who are starved produce clear and sour urine.
46
3
Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

(E3) The inner organs of rabbits with clear and sour urine show signs that their
bodies have metabolized their own muscle tissue.
All consequences could be observed to agree with his observations. Could we
now say that Bernard has proven his hypothesis? The answer will depend upon what
we mean by ‘prove’. If by ‘proof’ we mean a deﬁnitive argument such that doubt of
its premises and conclusions will never arise, then we cannot say that Bernard has
proven his hypothesis. Another experiment with different herbivores could turn out
differently and disprove the hypothesis. This is a general, purely logical, conclusion
from the fact that the hypothesis–like every other scientiﬁc hypothesis–states
something about all objects of a certain kind, while even the most thorough series
of experiments can only cover a sample of that kind. In this case, Bernard‘s
hypothesis is about all herbivores, though only a very few individuals of this kind
were examined by him. Absolute certainty, even if a great number of experiments
all agree with our hypothesis, cannot be had. What we eventually can say, at most,
is that we have good reasons in believing that our hypothesis in correct. We can
summarize the foregoing argument in the following way:
If H and A, then E1, E2 and E3
ð
Þ
E1, E2 and E3 are all true
-------------------------
H is supported
I have drawn a dotted line (instead of a solid line as in the last case) under the
premises to indicate that the inference is not logically valid. Thus, we cannot state
that H is true; rather, only that H is supported to some degree: that it now has more
credence than it initially had.
If we compare the two examples, we see an asymmetry; it is possible to
absolutely falsify a hypothesis, but it is not possible to absolutely prove one. Indeed,
we learned this earlier. There are many examples in science where a generally
accepted theory had to be given up based on more careful experiments, even when
the reasons for believing that theory for a long time were very good.
It is time to summarize what the hypothetical-deductive method amounts to:
•
Put forth a hypothesis.
•
Infer an empirically testable claim from the hypothesis and eventual auxiliary
assumptions.
•
Determine the veracity of the empirically testable claim via experiment and
observation.
•
Depending on whether the empirical implications are true or false, determine
whether the hypothesis is supported or falsiﬁed.
There are complications with this model to which I shall soon return. Presently it
is pertinent to present deﬁnitions of the key terms:
Theory¼def. A set of statements whose relations are explicitly stated.
3.3
Hypothetical-Deductive Method
47

Hypothesis¼def. A statement that (i) we are not entirely certain about, and
(ii) which is used as a premise in inferring empirical consequences.
Empirical Consequence¼def. A statement that (i) follows from the hypothesis and
eventual auxiliary assumptions, and (ii) whose truth, under plausible circum-
stances, can be determined by observation.
Auxiliary assumption¼def. A statement that (i) is necessary in order to infer an
empirical implication from a hypothesis, and which (ii) is not tested in the given
situation, but is rather assumed to be true.
Auxiliary assumptions can be of different kinds: results from other researchers,
relevant everyday observations, assumptions about the working of measurement
devices, or even whole theories. All can be called auxiliary assumptions, if they are
used when inferring testable claims from a hypothesis. Sometimes the matter is so
obvious that no one notices that there is an active hidden assumption until closer
inspection of the argument. Thus, when analysing an argument it is sometimes
useful to ﬁrst identify the hypotheses and the empirical consequences. Once one
puts these side by side, it is often the case that one notices a logical gap between the
hypothesis and its supposed empirical consequences. One may then formulate the
propositions needed to ﬁll that gap, thereby making explicit the auxiliary assump-
tions on which the argument is built.
3.4
Hypothesis Testing in the Social Sciences
Many have claimed that the formulation, and subsequent testing, of hypotheses is
unique to the natural sciences, and that the social and human sciences3 use alto-
gether different methods. Without going too deeply into this discussion, I would
still like to give an example from the social sciences that ﬁts quite well with the
model for hypothesis testing previously described. It is contained in Emile
Durkheim’s book Le Suicide (1897), where he discusses the social factors that
govern incidence of suicide. One of his ideas was that suicide incidence is
connected to the strength of social connections that exist between people. He called
this strength of inter-personal connection within a society that society’s degree of
integration and he assumed that the higher the degree of integration, the lower the
risk that one looses the desire to live and commits suicide. But how does one
measure degree of integration in a society?
Durkheim thought that there was a difference in the degree of integration
between catholic and protestant societies. Catholicism and Protestantism have
3 The traditional English label for the humanistic disciplines is ‘arts and humanities’, but those
who, like the present author, stress similarities among different sciences have began use the label
‘human sciences’ instead. In earlier times English used the term ‘moral sciences’ as contrast to
‘natural science’. In German one usually distinguishes between ‘Naturwissnschaften’ and
‘Kulturwissenschaften’, i.e. using the word ‘wissenschaft’ as a general label for all systematic
study at universities.
48

Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

very different views as to the role of the church as a link between God and humans.
There are many more church activities within Catholicism, and these have the effect
of bringing people together, which culminates in a higher degree of integration than
in Protestant communities (It should be kept in mind that it is the societal effects of
Catholicism and Protestantism which are relevant, not any theological differences.).
This assumption allows for the possibility of making comparisons. For example, in
Switzerland many cantons are broadly similar in all respects except whether
Catholicism or Protestantism predominates. If Durkheim’s hypothesis is correct,
then the suicide rate should be lower in the Catholic provinces than in the Protestant
provinces. This was, in fact, shown to be the case via statistical data. We can
reconstruct Durkheim’s argument in the following way:
(H) The suicide rate is higher in societies with a low degree of integration than in
societies with a high degree of integration.
(A) Catholic societies are more integrated than Protestant societies, all other
circumstances being equal.
(E) Catholic societies have lower suicide rates than Protestant societies, all other
circumstances being equal.
E is thus a prediction and we may compare with the actual records:
Observations:
Society type
Incidents of suicides (per million)
Catholic provinces in Switzerland
86.7
Mixed provinces
212
Protestant provinces in Switzerland
326
One has to admit that the empirical implications agree with these observations.
Naturally, this does not prove that Durkheim’s hypothesis is correct, since there
could be many other factors involved in determining incidents of suicide. However,
the observations strengthen his hypothesis.
3.5
Hypothesis Testing in History: The Wallenberg Affair
Testing of hypotheses is commonly viewed as completely distinct from methods in
the human sciences, which all are different versions of interpretation of human
artefacts. I will here exhibit a historical case, highly interesting in itself, which very
clearly exhibit a structure that nicely ﬁts into the schema of the hypothetico-

Hypothesis Testing in History: The Wallenberg Affair
49

Raoul Wallenberg–a Swedish diplomat active in Budapest in 1944 whose job it
was to help Hungarian Jews escape the Holocaust–was arrested by Russian troops
when they arrived in Budapest. On January 16, 1945, it was reported that Wallen-
berg and his property had been taken into Russian ‘protection’. On August 18, 1947,
the Russians sent a note (after inquiries from the Swedish government) that stated
that Wallenberg was not in the Soviet Union. Some years later, the Swedish
government made another inquiry as to Wallenberg’s whereabouts, since rumours
that Wallenberg was alive and in the Soviet Union were circulating. These inquiries
resulted in a memorandum that was sent to ambassador Sohlman on February
6, 1957, from Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko:
. . . In this matter, Soviet authorities have made the appropriate page-by-page review of
archived records from assistant departments in certain prisons. As a result of this review, an
archived document from healthcare services at Ljubljanka prison has been found, in which
there is evidence that Raoul Wallenberg was admitted there. The document is in the form of
a handwritten report – addressed to former Soviet Union Minister for State Security
Abakumov and written by the chief of healthcare services at this prison, A.L. Smoltsov –
containing the following information:
‘I report that the prisoner of your acquaintance, Walenberg, died suddenly last night in
his cell, apparently as a result of an induced myocardial infarction.
In following your instructions to personally oversee Walenberg, I request instruction as
to who will be responsible for performing an autopsy to determine the cause of death.
17.7.1947
Chief of the prison’s sanitation department
Colonel of Medical Services – Smoltsov’
On this report there is the following handwritten signature from Smoltov: ‘Have
personally informed the minister. Order had been given to cremate without autopsy. 17.7.
Smoltsov.’
There has been no more success in ﬁnding any other information in the form of
documents or testimony, given the death of aforementioned A.L. Smoltsov on May 7, 1953.
On the basis of what has been found, the conclusion drawn here is that Wallenberg died
in July, 1947.
Raoul Wallenberg was apparently arrested together with other prisoners in an area of
Soviet war activity. At the same time, one can be certain that Wallenberg’s later detention
and the false information about him being sent to the Soviet Foreign Ministry for a number
of years by former leaders of security agencies was the result of Abakumov’s criminal
activities. In response to his serious crimes, which aimed to cause all sorts of damage to the
Soviet Union, Akabumov was, as you know, sentenced to death by the USSR Supreme
Court.
The Soviet government expresses its sincerest condolences in light of what has occurred
and its deepest sympathies to the Swedish government and Raoul Wallenberg’s relatives.
At the time of this letter, Gromyko’s statement was generally accepted by the
Swedish government and the Swedish people. However, over time this opinion
changed and doubt of the truth of his statement gained traction. The reason for this
was that reports began to come in from various freed Russian prisoners that Raoul
Wallenberg was alive much later than the initial report indicated. Among these
prisoners were four that had been stationed at Wladimir prison who stated that
Wallenberg was there in the mid 1950s. These four prisoners included an Austrian
whose name was not given, a Swiss named Emil Brugger, and two Germans named
Horst Theodor Mu¨ller and Gustaf Rehekampff. The Austrian is the only person who
50
3
Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

purported having personal contact with Wallenberg. Brugger said that he had been
in the stockade with Wallenberg and the other two said that they heard from other
prisoners that Wallenberg had been in Wladimir. In a letter sent to the Soviet
government on July 17, 1959, the Swedish government wrote, ‘Of course the
Foreign Ministry must attach great importance to independent testimony of such
a precise nature regarding Wallenberg’s presence in certain prisons during certain
years in the 1950s.’
What is the truth? Hans and Elsa Villius consider in their book Fallet Raoul
Wallenberg (‘The Case of Raul Wallenberg’) three hypotheses:
H1. Smoltsov’s report is correct and RW died July 17, 1947.
H2. Smoltsov’s report is correct insofar as it describes death of a certain person, but
it was not RW but another one, with an almost similar name.
H3. Smoltsov’s report is a fabrication made by Soviet authorities.
The couple Villius conclude in their book that there is overwhelming evidence
for H1, that Wallenberg actually died in Ljubljanka prison in 1947. They base this
position on a critical analysis of the Russian letter, and transcripts of the hearings of
the four persons who claimed to have certain information about Wallenberg at
Wladimir prison, and a great deal of other information that I have omitted here for
lack of space. Some of the arguments resulting from their analysis are the
following:
•
The only document regarding Wallenberg that was found in the Soviet archives
was Smoltov’s letter. According to Kosygin, who was prime minister of the
Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1960s, there is no dossier on Wallenberg in
the Soviet government’s archives. This is explained by the fact that Abakumov
tried to dispose of all traces of Wallenberg after his death. This fact is strength-
ened by numerous accounts of former fellow prisoners who were questioned
about their knowledge of Wallenberg by high security ofﬁcers, and were there-
after moved, isolated and forced to guarantee that they would never mention
Wallenberg. Such evidence agrees with the claim that Smoltov’s letter is the
only document found, since it was never sent from the medical department of
Ljublanka and Abakumov did not know that it existed. It is also in accordance
with standard procedure that Smoltsov wrote down instructions given to him
orally by his superiors.
•
That Smoltsov received instructions from Abakumov to personally oversee
Wallenberg agrees with Abakumov’s later actions: as a diplomat, Wallenberg
was a particularly sensitive case.
•
It also agrees with Abakumov’s order to cremate without autopsy.
•
It also agrees with the fact that the Soviet Foreign Ministry, in 1947, claims that
Wallenberg was not in the Soviet Union: Abakumov simply lied when the Soviet
Foreign Ministry inquired.
•
It also agrees with the fact that Wallenberg’s dossier could not be found in the
Russian government’s archives. That it no longer existed in the beginning of the
1960s could only mean that a high-ranking ofﬁcial in the Russian government
3.5
Hypothesis Testing in History: The Wallenberg Affair
51

disposed of it (and Abakumov was minister for state security during the years in
question).
•
The misspelling of Wallenberg’s name is easy to understand, since in Russian
there is a tendency to pronounce double consonants singly. The misspelling is
actually an argument for the documents authenticity; for Smoltov it is natural to
write ‘Walenberg’ when writing to someone from which he had just received
verbal instructions. He wrote the letter as he had understood the name in a verbal
context.
•
The four people who came forth with information about Wallenberg’s stay in
Wladimir prison during the 1950s can be doubted. The anonymous man (his
name is known to the Swedish Foreign Ministry, but has never been published)
from Austria lacks credibility: among other things, he has given different
versions of his connection with Wallenberg, he testiﬁed long after the time of
the event in question and he was supposedly a cell spy according to another
testimony.
•
Brugger has reported having contact with Wallenberg in an article in Berner
Tageblatt. However, this story differs substantially from that told in front of a
Swedish representative less than 3 weeks after the Tageblatt article was
published. The differences heavily diminishes his credibility.
•
The two Germans relate their stories to the same source, a Georgian named
Simon Goguberidze, who in turn said that he heard people say that Wallenberg
was in Wladimir. There are circumstances making it probable that Goguberidze
is the source of Brugger’s claims as well, in which case Brugger’s, Muller’s and
Rehkampffs’ claims all originate from the same source. We thus essentially have
one third-hand testimony, and nothing more.
•
A series of prisoners from the Ljublanka and Lefortovo prisons in Moscow, who
in various ways came to know of Wallenberg, were later moved to Wladimir.
They were there isolated for a time, since they somehow knew of Wallenberg.
Yet, none of these people, who were all questioned after being released, claimed
that Wallenberg spent any time in Wladimir during the 1950s.
There is another series of arguments for the claim that Wallenberg died in 1947.
However, in summary we can say that the hypotheses (i) that Wallenberg died in
1947 in Ljublanka, and (ii) that Abakumov tried to dispose of any trace of him, are
greatly strengthened by these circumstances.
If we instead try the contrary hypothesis that Wallenberg did not die in 1947, we
must assume that either Smoltsov’s letter was a fabrication, or that this letter is
about another person. If it was a fabrication, then we need the auxiliary assumption
that the Russians have constructed the letter with the intent of deceiving the
Swedish government. In such a case, is it really believable that KGB–the Soviet
security agency–would have chosen to construct a single unofﬁcial document,
rather than producing nothing at all? If one had wanted to deceive the Swedes
into believing that Wallenberg was dead, would it not have been more effective to
fabricate an ofﬁcial autopsy report, written by some deceased medical ofﬁcer,
instead of a handwritten note relaying orders for cremation without autopsy? Is it
52
3
Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

credible that KGB would have misspelled Wallenberg’s name in such a fabrication?
It seems the only reasonable answers to both questions is no.
If Smoltsov’s note is about some other person, then there must have been
someone besides Wallenberg, another sensitively handled prisoner, for whom
Abakumov would require special attention, and with practically the same last
name as Wallenberg. Is this auxiliary assumption really believable? No, it is quite
improbable.
Elsa and Hans Villius thereby draw the conclusion that there is no reason to
doubt the authenticity of the Smoltsov-document, and thus the hypothesis that
Wallenberg died in Ljubljanka prison on the night of July 17, 1947, is strongly
supported.
It can be added that the latest (last?) investigation of the case, carried out by a
joint Swedish-Russian commission, came up with the same conclusion in January
2001 as had the Villius couple. The only signiﬁcant difference between the two
reports was some apparent evidence recorded in the commission’s report that
Wallenberg may have been poisoned and did not die a natural death.
3.6
Statistical Testing of Hypotheses
3.6.1
Bayesianism
To say that a hypothesis has been supported by an experiment is not very precise. It
is, without doubt, desirable to have a measure for the credence a given hypothesis
gains through experiment. Is it, then, possible to calculate the probability that a
certain hypothesis is true, given a certain experimental result? This is a controver-
sial question, involving the interpretation of probability.
The problem can formulated in the following way: we want to know the
conditional probability (see Sect. 7.3) for a hypothesis being true, given a certain
outcome of an experiment or measurement. Using the experiment’s outcome, we
can calculate this probability using Bayes’ formula:
P H
O


¼
P H
ð ÞP O
H


P H
ð ÞP O
H


þ P H0
ð
ÞP O
H0


where P(H) is the initial probability for the hypothesis H, and P(H|O) is the
probability for H given a statistical outcome O. Thus P(OjH) is the probability
for the outcome O given that the hypothesis H is true, and P(OjH0) is the probability
of an outcome O given that the null-hypothesis (the negation of the test-hypothesis)
H0 is true. I have here assumed that there are only two alternatives as regards
hypotheses: the test-hypothesis and null-hypothesis. Investigations of the effective-
ness of medicines against diseases provides good examples of this method. In such
a case, we can formulate the hypothesis as
3.6
Statistical Testing of Hypotheses
53

(H) The medicine has an effect on the progression of the disease.
The null-hypothesis is then,
(H0) The medicine has no effect on the progression of the disease.
In order to calculate the probability of the hypothesis H, given an outcome O, we
must determine the values of P(H), P(O|H) and P(O|H0). The two conditional
probabilities pose no fundamental problems, but how does one ﬁgure out the
original probability P(H)?
If one interprets the concept of probability as a measure of the degree of
subjective certainty–otherwise known as credence–one can imagine the following
argument: We have a hypothesis H, which is true or false. If we do not have any
speciﬁc information that argues for or against the hypothesis prior to our experi-
ments, then we may assume that the initial probability that H is true is 50 %, and
similarly that the probability of H being false (and thus the null-hypothesis being
true) is also 50 %. We may assume that these probabilities represent our degree of
belief in H and its contrary, and in the absence of any evidence one way or the other
it is plausible that we have as much belief in one as in the other. Then we perform
the experiments. With the help of Bayes’ formula, we can now calculate the new
probabilities; and thus generate a new probability distribution where the hypothesis
is either strengthened or weakened due to its probability either going up or down,
respectively. Furthermore, we now have a measure of the degree of strengthening/
weakening of propositions.
Contrarily, if one does not interpret probability as a measure of the degree of
subjective certainty but rather as an objective property, then it is difﬁcult to
motivate the claim that the original probabilities for a hypothesis being true or
false is 50/50. The actual unknown probability could be anything, and Bayes
formula is useless if the original probability is not known.
A fundamental question is whether it is scientiﬁcally justiﬁable to assume that
probability is a subjective phenomenon. Proponents of this methodology often
argue that no matter what the initial probabilities are, after a number of experi-
ments, the probabilities of different individuals converge. This means that despite
the subjective nature of initial probabilities, the long run results are still, arguably,
scientiﬁcally objective.
However, this view is not universally accepted. The majority claims that we are
not justiﬁed in any assumption regarding initial probabilities of a given hypothesis.
What remains then is to restrict oneself to calculating the conditional probability of
obtaining a certain statistical outcome, given the hypothesis.
3.6.2
Statistical Inference -Neyman-Pearson’s Method
The more common procedure in statistical testing is to assume the null-hypothesis
and calculate the conditional probabilities of the outcomes obtained. The following
54
3
Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

(ﬁctional) medical example may illustrate this approach. Suppose that a new
medicine in the ﬁght against AIDS has been created. Our hypothesis and null-
hypothesis are the same as above:
(H) The medicine has an effect on the progression of the disease.
(H0) The medicine has no effect on the progression of the disease.
(For the sake of simplicity, I will ignore the possibility of negative effects.) The
null-hypothesis implies that the difference between the groups is exactly zero,
which is not particularly reasonable. In a more realistic experiment, one would
formulate the null-hypothesis in terms of the difference being less than some
arbitrarily chosen value. However, I shall ignore this complication in this case.
In order to determine the possible effects of the treatment, nine patients were
given the new medicine while nine other patients were used as a control group. The
patients in both groups are chosen at random. After treatment the results were:
Treated
Untreated
Alive
6
1
Dead
3
8
Sum
9
9
A statistical test shows that if the null-hypothesis were true, then the probability
of the above outcome would be less than 1 %. Is this sufﬁcient for abandoning the
null-hypothesis, drawing the conclusion that the treatment is effective? Most would
probably answer ‘Yes’, but where does one draw the line? How low a probability
for the experimental outcome, conditional on the null-hypothesis, is required before
one considers that null-hypothesis refuted?
The choice is determined by balancing two risks against each other: the risk of
accepting a false test-hypothesis (by rejecting a true null-hypothesis) and the risk of
rejecting a true test hypothesis (by accepting a false null-hypothesis). In practice,
one often takes the threshold to be 5 %, 1 % or 0.1 %. If the probability of some
experimental outcome, given the null-hypothesis, is at most 5 %, then one says that
the result is one-star signiﬁcant. If it is at most 1 %, then the result is called two-star
signiﬁcant; and similarly, 0.1 % is three-star signiﬁcant. The methodological rule is
that one should determine the level of signiﬁcance before the experiment is done
and then accept or reject the null-hypothesis as the case may be.
Plainly, this rule is not certain to give correct conclusions. The probability for
the outcome, conditional on the null-hypothesis, can be higher than 5 % in spite of
the null-hypothesis being false, and it is possible that the signiﬁcance value is less
than 5 % (or any other chosen limit) though the null-hypothesis is true. We talk
about two types of errors:
1. We reject H0 while in fact it is true: error of the ﬁrst kind.
2. We accept H0 while in fact it is false: error of the second kind.
Hence, making an error of the ﬁrst kind means accepting a false test hypothesis,
an error of the second kind means rejecting a true test hypothesis.
3.6
Statistical Testing of Hypotheses
55

The conclusion of this discussion is that if we are not prepared to say that a
hypothesis has some initial probability, then using statistical methods does not
allow one to claim any more than in earlier examples: experimental results merely
strengthen or weaken test-hypotheses in a rather imprecise and hand-waving fash-
ion. However, if one allows that test-hypotheses do have known initial probabili-
ties, then one can make precise the degree to which a test hypothesis is strengthened
by some experimental result. For instance, in the immediately preceding example,
if we, being subjectivists, assume that the probability distribution between hypoth-
esis and null-hypothesis is 50/50 before the experiment, then we can calculate,
using Bayes’ formula, the hypothesis’ probability given the above results to be
99 %. How sensitive is this probability for variations in assumptions about prior
probabilities? Not much; if, for example, one is rather pessimistic and say that the
prior probability for the hypothesis is only 10 %, its probability after the test is
instead 87 %.
Comparing these two methods from a purely epistemological perspective, I see
no substantial difference. Both contain an element of subjective decision. In both
there is a risk of making a mistake, which as a matter of principle cannot be
completely eliminated.
3.7
Unacceptable Auxiliary Assumptions: Ad
Hoc-Hypotheses
As we saw in the Abiogenesis example, one can save a hypothesis from falsiﬁcation
if one can ﬁnd an auxiliary assumption to which one can direct modus tollens.
Recall that if two or more hypotheses are required in order to infer an empirical
consequence, and if that empirical consequence is false, then one cannot logically
determine which of the hypotheses are false. Thus, if one is loathed to reject a
certain hypothesis, then it can be saved from falsiﬁcation by adding new auxiliary
assumptions. However, such an attitude is hardly conducive to good science; rather,
one should be prepared to reject or revise even the most well established theories if
there is enough evidence against them.
An auxiliary assumption that is proposed only to save another hypothesis from
falsiﬁcation is called an ad hoc-hypothesis (ad hoc ¼ for this). It is obvious that one
cannot accept ad hoc-hypotheses in scientiﬁc argumentation. Then how does one
distinguish between acceptable auxiliary assumptions and unacceptable ad
hoc-hypotheses? Karl Popper, among others, have argued that ad hoc-hypotheses
differ from acceptable auxiliary assumptions in that it is possible to independently
test the latter by conducting experiments with no connection to the original ones,
but not possible to do the same for the former. A couple of examples from ancient
astronomy should illustrate this idea.
Example 1 According to the ancient world-view, the Earth was the centre of the
universe and all celestial bodies revolved around it in perfect circles at constant
56
3
Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

speeds. In the heavens, all motion was perfect. Observation of the sun, moon and
the stars seemed to agree with this theory.
However, the motion of planets, such as Mars, does not ﬁt the theory. Viewed
against the ﬁxed stars Mars sometimes appears to move ‘backwards’.
Every day Mars appears to move one revolution around the Earth, so that against
the ﬁxed stars it moves slowly from west to east. However, sometimes Mars ‘backs
up’ in what is known as retrograde motion, as can be seen in Fig. 3.1. Does this
mean that Mars sometimes slows down? No, such imperfect motion was not
reasonable for the ancient astronomers.
Ptolemy (Greek astronomer, active in Alexandria circa 90–168 A.D.) construed
an improved system that agreed with the observed retrograde motions. He claimed
that each planet moved in a small circle, an epicycle, around a mathematical point
located on the planet’s main circular path around the Earth. He also placed the Earth
a little bit away from the centre of the main circular path. When you combine these
two circular motions–the epicycle and the main circular path–with suitably chosen
radii, you get the apparent motion of the planet. Seen from Earth, Mars is in
retrograde motion when it moves in a direction opposite to that of its main path.
Since one has no restrictions on the choice of the epicycle, one can construct a
system that agrees perfectly with the observed retrograde motion. However, given
that there is no argument for why Mars should rotate around a mathematical point in
space and since there is no independent way to test the hypothesis, the assumption
of epicycles is an ad hoc-hypothesis (Fig. 3.2).
Another problem in ancient astronomy was to explain the existence of two kinds
of eclipses, total and annular. It is noteworthy that the apparent sizes of the sun and
the moon, as seen from Earth, are very nearly the same; hence when the Earth,
Moon and Sun are all aligned, the moon is just the right apparent size to hide the
Sun from the Earth in what we know as an eclipse. If, as the ancients believed, the
Sun and Moon’s orbits of the Earth were perfectly circular, with the earth at the
centre of that circle, then every eclipse would be the same. Yet, all eclipses are not
exactly similar; some eclipses are total–where the sun is completely obscured from
the earth–and some are annular–where one sees a thin ring of the sun past the edge
of the moon. We now know that this difference in eclipses is due to our Earth
orbiting the sun in an ellipse with the sun at one of the ellipse’s foci; however, this
explanation was not available to the ancients as such elliptical motions were
incompatible with the their divinely perfect heaven; according to ancient views,
an ellipsis is a non-perfect, misshaped circle.
One hypothesis that was proposed at the time to explain this conﬂict between
theory and observation was that the moon sometimes shrinks and expands! But the
change in size is so small that the only way to notice it is to observe its effect during
solar eclipses, which implies that there is no way of independently testing this
assumption.
Thus,
this
assumption
provides
another
example
of
an
ad
hoc-hypothesis.
However, if we consider this matter from a present day technological point of
view, the situation is quite different, since nowadays it is relatively easy to

accurately measure the diameter of the moon, for example using lasers. This shows
that the question of whether the auxiliary assumption is testable or not is not so easy
to determine as it might ﬁrst appear. Criteria regarding independent testability do
not seem to be absolute. Rather, they have to do with what is possible at a particular
time. Even though all scientists have a strong intuition about what should count as
an ad hoc-hypothesis, it is thus difﬁcult to give a deﬁnite criterion.
3.8
Summary
The least common denominator for all sciences is that hypotheses are formulated
and tested. This is meaningful only if one is prepared to change one mind after
testing, to admit that even one favourite hypothesis was wrong. This state of mind is
a crucial part of the scientiﬁc attitude.
Testing hypotheses against observations require auxiliary assumptions. They
can also be tested, of course, although in a particular case of hypothesis testing they
are taken for granted at the beginning.
The result of the test is either that the predictions and observation reports are
compatible, or that they conﬂict. In the former case one may be justiﬁed to say that
one’s hypothesis is supported. In the latter case one must reconsider something; one
must reject either the hypothesis, some auxiliary assumption, or the observation
report. If one decides that the hypothesis is to be rejected, one has falsiﬁed it. It is
thus clear that falsiﬁcation of a hypothesis is no automatic inference from the test
result; it is the result of a judgement, all aspects considered.
Exercises
Below are three short summaries of popular scientiﬁc articles. Give an analysis of
the argumentation in each abstract using the concepts of hypothesis, auxiliary
assumption and empirical consequence!
1. It has been generally assumed that the dinosaurs were cold-blooded animals.
This assumption has been criticized by Stephen Jay Gould. He claims that they
must have been warm-blooded because:
(a)
The temperature of cold-blooded animals’ varies with outside temperature.
Cold-blooded animals that live in areas with large changes in temperature
between summer and winter get growth rings in the outer parts of their
skeletons, similar to the growth rings of trees. Warm-blooded animals do
not get such rings since they maintain, more or less, a constant body
temperature. Dinosaurs that lived in areas of varying temperature did not
have such growth rings.
(b)
Large cold-blooded animals do not live near the Polar Regions since they
cannot get enough warmth during the short winter days and are too large to
ﬁnd secure shelter. Some large dinosaurs lived so far north that they must

have spent long periods of time without sunlight; and thus without an
external heat source during the winter.
(c)
Modern reconstructions of the anatomy of various dinosaurs show that
many large dinosaurs are similar to present-day mammals (which are
warm-blooded), both in regard to skeletal muscles and the proportions of
various limbs.
2. The following text is an excerpt from the article ‘The Conﬁrmation of the
Continental Drift’ in Scientiﬁc American, April 1968. It discusses the possibility
that Africa and South America were once joined, an idea that seems quite natural
when looking at the contours of these two continents.
Of particular interest for us was the sharp borderline between the 2000 million year-old
geological area in Ghana, the Ivory Coast and further west, and the 600 million year-old
area of Benin, Nigeria and further east. This borderline runs southwest towards the ocean
near Accra, Ghana. If Brazil (and all of South America) had been part of Africa 500 million
years ago, the borderline between these two areas would have run through South America
near the city of Sao Luis on the north coast of Brazil. Therefore, out ﬁrst task is dating the
areas near Sao Luis.
To our pleasure and surprise, the results fell into two groups: 2000 million years on the
west side and 600 million years on the east side of the borderline where we had expected it
to be. It appeared as if a 2000 million year-old piece of Africa had landed on the South
American continent.
3. Over the years 1844–1848, Ignaz Semmelweis worked as an obstetrician in
Vienna. The hospital where he worked had two maternity wards, each taking
approximately 3000 admissions per year. It so happened that the proportion of
deaths due to puerperal fever was markedly different between the two wards:
Ward 1 (%)
Ward 2 (%)
1844
8.2
2.3
1845
6.6
2.0
1846
11.4
2.7
A great many explanations of this difference were proposed, such as incorrect
birthing position, poor diet, ‘atmospheric conditions’ etc. All of these could be
discarded quite reasonably. Then Semmelweis got the idea that some ‘cadaveric
material’ from dead persons had been transported to Ward 1, which agreed with the
fact that at Ward 1 medical students were instructed after having partaken in
autopsies, while at Ward 2 midwives, who had no contact with cadavers, were
instructed. As an experiment, Semmelweis had all who came to Ward 1 from an
autopsy wash their hands in chlorinated lye. The results of this experiment on the
number of deaths due to puerperal fever were the following:
Ward 1
Ward 2
1848
1.27 %
1.37 %
60

Hypotheses and Hypothesis Testing

(Unfortunately, Semmelweis’ experiment was not accepted as a good argument
for continuing to wash one’s hands after autopsies. Semmelweis was dismissed and
the use of disinfectants ceased. It took more than 20 years until the practice of
disinfection became commonplace, thanks to Pasteur’s discovery of bacteria.)

4.1
Measurement and Scales
Galilei, Kepler, and some other scholars around 1600 began making systematic
measurements of the motion of bodies on earth and in the sky. This was a crucial
aspect of the scientiﬁc revolution. At start such measurements was not consciously
aimed at testing hypotheses, but the ﬁrst results could be generalised to simple
regularities, which could be treated as hypotheses and tested in new experiments in
which kinematic quantities are measured.
A measurement is a comparison with a standard of some kind, and the result of
repeated measurements is an ordering of objects in terms of how they compare to
the standard. Another was of saying the same thing is to say that a particular type of
measurement determines a scale, where each scales impose an order among a sets of
objects. One says that the pike weighs 4 kg, that the A4-paper is 210 mm wide, or
that Ann got an A in English. A statement about a measurement is an indication that
a certain object is assigned a measure and a quantity. One can have various units for
measurements of the same object. For example, length can be measured in meters,
yards or feet. For it to be meaningful to say that one and the same property can be
measured in various units, there must exist a well-deﬁned transformation that
converts one unit into another. The characteristics of these transformations can be
used to give precise deﬁnitions of the different types of scales, as we shall soon see.
First, however, I will give an informal characterization of four scale types.
A nominal scale (Latin nomen ¼ name) is simply a classiﬁcation of observa-
tions into categories. For such scales, no numerical comparison between values is
possible, since no numbers can be assigned. One cannot say that some object has
more or less of some property than another.
Example Consider the blood types A, B, AB, and O. One cannot say of one of these
types that it has more or less of some property than any other. Blood type A has the
A-factor but not the B-factor, and blood type B has the B-factor but not the

A-factor. The only thing we can say is that two people with different blood types
have blood with different properties.
An ordinal scale is a ranking of objects with respect to some property where
objects have more or less of the measured property. However, there is no universal
standard as regards to the relative sizes of the increments in the scale: all that can be
said is that one object has more or less of some property than another, not how much
more or less of that property.
Example Many grading systems are ordinal scales, such as the European ECTS
grading system A, B, C, D, E, FX and F. In this system one can say that a student
who was given a C is more knowledgeable (according to the teacher) than a student
who received a D, and that a student who received a B is more knowledgeable than
both. Yet, we cannot say that the difference between B and C is the same as the
difference between C and D.
An interval scale is a scale where the measurement data is ordered into a
hierarchy with equal steps between increments. This means that one can make
quantitative comparisons of measurements.
Example The most common scale for measuring temperature is Celsius. Using this
scale, we can show that the differences between 30 C and 20 C, and 20 C and
10 C, are the same; since a difference of 1 is equal for any two consecutive points
on this scale. However, we cannot make sense of ratios of measurements in this
scale, as this would presume a non-trivially chosen zero-point representing the
absence of the property being measured. 0 C is not the absence of temperature, but
rather a zero chosen for practical reasons, viz., the freezing point of water.
Finally, the quotient scale is an interval scale with a ﬁxed zero-point
representing complete absence of the measured property. This allows meaningful
talk of quotients between measurements of different sizes.
Example Measurements of length. An object’s length is measured using a variety
of instruments: meter sticks, callipers, lasers, satellites, etc. We have an interna-
tionally accepted scale of measurement (1 m ¼ the distance light travels in
1/299,792,458 s). If an object has a length of 0 m, then it has no length. Thus we
can talk about a certain object being twice as long as another. If the zero were
arbitrarily chosen, then the ratios between measurement values would change
depending on where one chooses to place the zero-point. By comparison, we can
hardly say that 20 C is twice as warm as 10 C, as becomes obvious when one
expresses the same temperature in the Fahrenheit scale: 10 C ¼ 50 F and
20 C ¼ 68 F; hence this ratio of 2:1 in Celsius is a ratio of 6.8:5 in Fahrenheit.
Thus a scale is an assignment of numbers to objects (one can even assign
numbers to categories in a nominal scale). Such an assignment is called a measure.
With this terminology in hand, we can now give the following formal deﬁnitions of
the various types of scale:
Def. 1: A measure f for a quantity q is a quotient scale if and only if for any other
measure g of the same quantity there exists a number k > 0 such that f ¼ kg
64

On Scientiﬁc Data

Def. 2: A measure f for a quantity q is an interval scale if and only if for any other
measure g of the same quantity there exists a number k > 0 and a real number
r such that f ¼ kg + r
Def. 3: A measure f for a quantity q is an ordinal scale if and only if for any other
measure g of the same quantity there exists a strictly increasing function j such
that g ¼ j( f )
Notice that the nominal scale is not given a formal deﬁnition above. There is
perhaps reason to claim that the nominal scale is not actually a scale in the full sense
of the word, but merely a classiﬁcatory scheme. However, the reason why it
appeared ﬁrst in the informal characterization above is that, in the transition from
the nominal scale to the quotient scale, via the interval and ordinal scales, one sees
an increase in the structuring of one’s set of observations. I shall discuss the
different types of classiﬁcations, especially classiﬁcations in the humanities and
social sciences, in more detail in the next chapter.
In order to facilitate automatic recording and statistical processing one often
assigns reference numerals to recorded observations, but it is a mistake to treat these
labels as numbers, which are the normal reference of numerals.1 This situation
often arises with surveys. Many different types of surveys are comprised of various
claims and the one taking the survey is required to mark one of the following
alternative responses to each claim: Strongly Agree, Somewhat Agree, No Opinion,
Somewhat Disagree, Strongly Disagree. This is a typical ordinal scale. It is com-
monplace that one assigns to these alternatives the following numerals: 5, 4, 3, 2
and 1. But the use of numerals to designate outcomes does not imply that one is
using an interval or quotient scale; indeed, in this case the scale is plainly ordinal. In
such situations, where numerals serve merely to rank or label, calculating means
and standard deviations over them is meaningless. For it to be meaningful to
calculate means and standard deviations over the results of opinion surveys the
difference between, e.g., ‘strongly agree’ and ‘somewhat agree’ would have to be
the same as the difference between ‘no opinion’ and ‘somewhat disagree’, but as
standardly conceived this is just not the case.
4.2
Statistical Relations
It is quite often the case that we want to know if there is some connection between
two variables. In an ideal experiment, one variable is varied in order to study the
effects on another while all other variables are kept constant. But in most cases this
is not possible. In many disciplines, such as medicine or climate research, we just
do not know all of the relevant variables involved in a certain situation. Further-
more, even if we knew exactly which variables should be held constant, it is often
1 A numeral is a symbol, a linguistic sign that usually denotes an abstract object, a number.
However, in some cases the numeral denotes a category of responses.

practically impossible to do so; how is one to construct an experiment to study the
effect of a volcanic eruption on the world’s average temperature? There may also be
ethical restrictions, such as that one shouldn’t manipulate people, animals or the
environment without due regard to their wellbeing.
The conclusion is that actively controlled experiments are often infeasible, and
that one must often be satisﬁed with passive observations instead. In order to
determine whether two variables are in some way connected, one has to study
many cases. The idea is that if one studies sufﬁciently many, randomly selected
cases, then one has reason enough to believe that all other factors effecting the
variables one wants to study are haphazardly distributed among the studied cases.
Using statistical methods, one can then estimate the probability that an eventual
connection between two studied variables is the result of the inﬂuence of
uncontrolled variables; the larger the number of cases, the smaller the probability
that the eventual connection does not obtain.
The ﬁrst step is to conduct a sample test of a population and measure the two
properties. One can then study the graph one gets if one places one of the variable
properties on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. Consider the following
example:
A laboratory studied the relation between how long it takes for laboratory
assistants to perform a certain procedure and the number of mistakes that were
made. The results are presented in the following table.

It is difﬁcult to infer anything from this table, but let us look at the so-called
scatter plot (Fig. 4.1).
In this diagram one can see a certain tendency that the longer a procedure takes,
the fewer mistakes are made. A measure for this tendency is the so-called coefﬁ-
cient of correlation (also called product-moment coefﬁcient of correlation) which is
given by the formula

where n is the number of observations, and x and y are the two variables. In this case
the correlation is 0.47, which is a moderately negative connection. Of course, this
was just a sample test, and without more information no deﬁnite conclusion can be
drawn; it may very well happen that a larger sample test will show no correlation.
But let us assume, for now, that this negative correlation is close to the actual: that it
is the correlation that would result in an unlimited test. Given this assumption, our
guess that the tendency for fewer mistakes to be made when time is increased is
correct, since the correlation coefﬁcient is negative.
Correlation coefﬁcients range between +1 and 1. If the correlation is +1 we
have a fully positive correlation, and if it is 1 we have a fully negative correlation.
The minus sign shows that an increase in the value of one variable tends to decrease
the value of the other variable. The following are two scatter plots with calculated
correlations for different sets of data (Figs. 4.2 and 4.3).
The second scatter plot shows a ‘thicker’ ﬁgure than the previous, which implies
a lower correlation. Roughly speaking, the thinner and longer the area covered by
accumulated points is, the higher the correlation. In the next graph we see a
correlation between data from two secondary school physics tests, of which one
is called the ‘practical test’, and the other ‘paper-and-pen’ (Fig. 4.4).
Here we see that the plot is quite narrow, which implies a high correlation. The
calculation rxy ¼ 0.81 conﬁrms this. (I once conducted these two tests myself in
order to see if there were any signiﬁcant differences between the practical and

theoretical capabilities of my physics students. The high degree of correlation
shows that there was not.)
In the extreme case, when all points are located on a straight line, rxy ¼ 1 (or if
negative, then rxy ¼ 1). The exception is when the line is vertical or horizontal,
which means that the coefﬁcient of correlation is 0.
However, the coefﬁcient of correlation is not always useful as a measure of
correlation. A moment’s reﬂection tells us that this mathematical measure pre-
supposes that both variables form interval or quotient scales, i.e. scales with

for studying correlations.
In Chap. 7 we will discuss the conclusions one can draw from the existence of a
correlation between two variables.

conclusions are supported by the evidence. Of course, there are practical limits to
what it is possible to make explicit for the reader to inspect. The reader will
naturally have to take some things for granted, such as the raw data, which is
often automatically recorded by a computer. While certain scientiﬁc journals
require that one send in original recordings of one’s measurements in order to
check the reported data, sometimes this is impossible in principle as the raw data
maybe comprised of a researcher’s reports of their private observations, which are
not open to independent scrutiny. Here is the limit of the science’s objectivity; a
space for both conscious cheating and unconscious mistakes. The following two
examples from the history of science should illustrate this fact.
Example 1 The American psychologist Robert Rosenthal performed the following
famous experiment. He told a number of students to conduct an experiment on mice
in order to investigate the mice’s learning ability. Sixty mice were distributed
among 12 students. Half of the mice were said to be of a particularly ‘gifted’
kind, and half were supposedly of a ‘slow’ kind. The students were to place the mice
in a labyrinth in which one route led to a food bowl. The students would then study
the mice’s ability to learn by measuring the time it took for them to ﬁnd the food.
The result was as expected: the group of mice that were more ‘intelligent’ was
quicker to learn than the not so gifted mice. In addition, the students noted that the
quick thinking mice refused to move 11 % of the time, whereas the less gifted
refused to move 20 % of the time.
The point of this experiment was not to investigate the intelligence of the mice,
but to discover something about the students! In fact, there was no intrinsic
difference between either of group of mice! The students had merely let their
expectations direct their observations of how long it took the mice to ﬁnd food. It
may strike one as strange that there could be a subjective element in the measuring
of time, but such is the case according to Rosenthal. His general conclusion, based
on this experiment, was that there is a measure of unconscious judgment, not a
simple recording, in each observational statement. Note, however, that this concept
of judgment is different from the interpretation of intentional entities like human
actions, artefacts and texts, to be discussed in the next chapter.
Example 2 For a long time surgical transplantation was plagued by the body’s
rejection of foreign objects. Then a young American scientist claimed to have
succeeded in controlling the mechanisms of the immune system to prevent rejection
of foreign objects and tissue. He presented a number of white mice with large black
fur patches on their backs, which he claimed to have been transplanted onto the
mice. Other researchers then attempted to duplicate this experiment, but all such
attempts failed. Not until an assistant to the American scientist happened to get
black paint on his ﬁngers upon returning the mice to their cages did people begin
question the validity of his results. In fact, it turned out that the scientist has simply
painted black spots on the backs of the mice!
70

On Scientiﬁc Data

The blatant fraud committed by the scientist in the story of the mice with black
spots triggers the question of how common such deceit really is? No one knows for
sure; however, in their book Betrayers of the Truth, Broad and Wade discuss a large
number of fraudulent cases, and come to the pessimistic conclusion that deceit in
science is widespread. There are two explanations for this. Firstly, since academic
careers are extremely competitive, and largely depend on the signiﬁcance and
quantity of the results one has published, there is a great incentive to cheat. As
they say in USA, ‘Publish or perish’. Secondly, little academic merit is accrued by
repeating previously conducted experiments; so few experiments are ever repeated.
Not until there is reason to suspect fraudulent or sloppy work does anyone take the
trouble to repeat an experiment. Hence according to Broad and Wade there is both
powerful motive, and ample opportunity, for fraud in the sciences.
One should perhaps not over-generalize Broad and Wade’s conclusions. As they
themselves point out, the possibility and risk for fraud is different in different
scientiﬁc disciplines. In some disciplines, a great mass of empirical research is
conducted in rather routine fashion. This is what Kuhn calls normal science (see
Chap. 6). An individual investigation often aims at testing a fairly well established
hypothesis, theory or method in a new situation, e.g. the measurement of physical or
chemical properties of new substances. For the individual researcher, an investiga-
tion can often be motivated by the prospect of greater academic accreditation, while
the relevance to the scientiﬁc community is often restricted to the results strength-
ening an already successful theory. Thus, scientiﬁc results can often glossed as ‘we
have conﬁrmed that our methods, or theories, hold in yet another case’. In these
kinds of situations there is a signiﬁcant risk of fraud, as the chance of detection is
minimal. However, it would be too hasty to draw the conclusion that fraud and
deception are common practice in the scientiﬁc community, or that experimental
results are entirely untrustworthy. My own view is quite the opposite; namely, that
fraud and deception belong to the exception and not the rule. After all, just because
scientists have motive and plenty of opportunity to commit fraud, this does not
mean that most will do so.
Returning to the central theme of this section, we shall now differentiate
observations from observational statements. Observations are mental processes;
and as such, they are private and exempt from external veriﬁcation. Observational
statements – which include the statements made by scientists and researchers – are
verbal or written and so externally veriﬁable in principle. Observational statements
are what scientiﬁc theories are tested against, not the observations reported by such
statements. To make an observational statement – to report what one has observed –
is a more or less conscious human act, to judge, and not a passive reﬂection of
incoming stimuli. The senses, in so far as we regard them as distinct from the mind,
merely transmit signals to the mind. This is what Kant implied by the citation at the
beginning of this chapter.

4.4
On the Theory-Dependence of Observational
Statements
Intuitively, it seems an easy task to distinguish between observation and theory. A
theory is something abstract, often comprised of a number of formulas or general
sentences. (Recall the deﬁnition of a theory presented in Chap. 3; a theory is a set of
propositions whose inherent connection is explicitly stated). An observation, on the
other hand, is a concrete action; something one does. However, actions must be
described using words if they are to be of any value in a scientiﬁc community;
hence, observations are described by observational statements.
The question then arises: is it just as easy to distinguish between theoretical
statements and observational statements? The answer is no, as can be seen from the
previous examples regarding how unconscious background beliefs can affect what
is observed and reported even a in a very simple tasks such as time measurements.
Many have drawn from such considerations the conclusion that all observation is
theory-dependent. Their argument is as follows: Observation is an active process.
Our sensory organs are exposed to physical stimuli, which spark a number of
mental activities including processing and sorting of those stimuli in various
ways. This processing is shaped by one’s past experience, attentiveness, attitudes
and expectations. The result is an observation expressed as an observational
statement. Formulation of this statement requires a language containing a number
of general terms by which one describes ones observations. This language and its
categorizations are not theory-neutral; rather, they are mostly formulated in accor-
dance with our preconceptions of the world. In short, our use of language is not
theory-neutral in the strict sense of the word; neither the act of observation, nor the
observational statements expressing those observations, are theory-neutral. N. R.
Hanson argued this point in his (1965).
W. V. Quine disagrees2 to a certain extent. He concedes that many of the
observational statements in science are highly dependent on theory, but, he claims,
there does exist some basic observational statements that everyone would agree to,
independent of observers’ culture, perspective or beliefs. A couple of obvious
examples are ‘the sky is now blue’, ‘there are seven apples in the basket’, and
‘the meter presently shows no deﬂection’. These statements describe here-and-now
situations; and thus they are called occasion sentences. All competent speakers of
the language in which these statements are expressed are able to immediately
determine whether they are true or false simply by observing what is the case
here and now. Thus according to Quine there is a solid foundation for our theoriz-
ing, though only some of the sentences we usually call observational statements are,
in fact, theory-independent occasion sentences.
This opposing argument is based upon an important premise; namely, that two
observers have access to the same language. This is certainly not always the case.
2 This argument can be found in several of his writings, e.g. in the ﬁrst chapter of his Pursuit of
Truth, Harvard University Press, 1990.

There would be no issue if one could claim that, in principle, there is no problem in
translating sentences of one language into sentences of another. Unfortunately, as
any translator knows, this is far from the truth. Quine has discussed this question in
connection with an investigation of the concept of linguistic meaning, and his
conclusion is that there is a degree of indeterminacy, far from negligible, in any
translation from one language to another.3 Yet, no translation is entirely arbitrary:
for, if a translation is to be acceptable, it must translate occasion sentences in one
language held true by persons talking that language into occasion sentences of the
other language held true by persons talking the second language.
In my opinion, Quine is correct. This foundation of occasion sentences whose
truth-value people agree upon is what is needed in order to claim that science has
any measure of objectivity. It should be observed that if two or more persons agree
to assent or to dissent to a sentence, they need not interpret it the same way. One can
for example imagine two persons with different world-views and different lan-
guages seeing a horse in the meadow. One has adopted Plato’s world-view, and
says, in his language, something like ‘Lo, the Horse-form is instantiated’, the other
thinks in terms of nature populated with individual objects belonging to different
categories and says, in his language ‘Lo, a horse.’ (I have here given a translation of
both expressions to English, of course.) If the speakers agree on what they are
looking at, and are able to recognize outward expressions for assent and dissent,
they can agree to each others utterances, without having any translation manual at
hand, although their ontologies differ. So Quine’s argument is that we may differ
radically in our beliefs, theories etc., but it is nevertheless possible to ﬁnd a
common ground, viz., agreement on truth and falsity of occasion sentences.
Petra Stoerig provides good justiﬁcation for this view in her interesting analysis4
of visual observation processes based on the presence of various types of brain
damage and the associated loss of different aspects of one’s vision. She describes
three steps in the process of visual observation, or seeing. Firstly, we can distin-
guish a purely phenomenal encounter in which an object is not yet recognized, but
where merely a number of qualities, such as light-dark contrasts and blotches of
colour, are perceived. One is aware that one is seeing, but not what one is seeing.
Some people who are born blind has been surgically treated for their blindness so
that signals from their eyes enter the brain. But they have had great difﬁculties
learning to interpret visual perceptions, like seeing an object, even where the object
is familiar to them. During this period of learning, the patients experience the visual
world as a unordered chaos of colours, forms, light and dark, and only after a long
time do they learn how to order impressions into ﬁgures and objects (many patients
fail to do so).
3 We may carefully observe that Quine claims that there is no fact of the matter which translation is
correct, it is not merely that we are uncertain about which is correct.

Neurosciences, 19(9), 401–406.

On the Theory-Dependence of Observational Statements
73

The second step in the process of seeing is to perceive objects as constituted by
separate colours, shapes and contrasts. This results in distinguishing visual objects
from their background. However, this perception is still not recognition (Fig. 4.5).
There are people who perceive an object, and yet cannot say what kind of object it
is, even though they have the linguistic comprehension required to do so. For
example, one can know what a cat is, and be able to describe what a cat looks
like, and yet still be unable to recognize that a certain visual perception of a
physically extended object is of a cat. This inability to recognize objects can be
found in dementia patients. Oliver Sachs has colourfully described such a patient in
his book The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat. (It regards an elderly man who
could no longer recognize his wife, even though he was still able to distinguish
various objects in his surroundings).
The third, and last, step in this process is to recognize a given visual object as an
object of a certain kind. Only when this step is completed does one have a visual
observation in the full sense of the word. Hence, the act of perception/observation
can be analysed, both conceptually and physically, as a three-step process. When
we talk about visual perception – seeing – what we usually mean is the complete
process culminating in recognition of an object as an object of a certain kind.
Furthermore, it seems reasonable to assume that ‘perceiving’ by the other senses
could also be analysed into stepwise processes, but Stoerig does not discuss this
possibility.
The transition from step two to step three in the process of observation given
above can be illustrated by the following example. Suppose the object of our
perception is a ﬁgure that looks like a duck or a hare, depending on how you look
at it (see Fig. 4.6). We agree that we observe a certain ﬁgure, but we do not agree on
what kind of ﬁgure it is. According to the deﬁnition of an occasion sentence, in this
situation the sentence ‘This ﬁgure depicts a duck.’, is no occasion sentence, if it is
the case that some people see the ﬁgure as a hare. However, if we reformulate the
observational statement so that it is neutral with respect to the kind of object being
observed, then it will count as an occasion sentence. In the case of Fig. 4.6, the
Fig. 4.5 We perceive this
ﬁgure, without exception, to

triangle, that is, we
construct a ﬁgure of the
given visual elements
74

On Scientiﬁc Data

sentence ‘I see a contour that can be interpreted as either a duck or a hare’ is a
theory-neutral occasion sentence, since everyone would agree with it. The point is
that one can formulate observational statements without deﬁnite recognition of the
object. However, it should be noted that what would elicit agreement from all
humans irrespective of culture, and what would do so only within particular cultural
contexts, is an empirical question. All that is required for the possibility of theory-
neutral observations is the existence of some universal agreement among all
humans: i.e. that all people have certain features of their cognitive equipment in
common.
In medicine, we come across yet another problem regarding testing the effec-
tiveness of medical treatments; namely, the placebo effect. If a patient believes that
the medicine he is told to take is effective, then the patient’s expectations of being
cured are increased. This changes the prognosis of the disease by raising the
probability of a positive outcome regardless of whether the medicine has any
pharmacological effect! In order to eliminate the placebo effect in the evaluation
of treatments, one needs two groups whose members are ignorant as to which group
they belong to: a test group and a control group. Furthermore, to minimize the
effects of expectations on the data, such as those discussed previously in the timing
of mice (expectations being, or resulting from, a sort of primitive theorising) one
must make it so that even those administering the treatments are ignorant as to
which group is which. This procedure – known as double blind testing – is standard
for all trials of medical treatments. Since neither the participants nor the people
administering the treatment know who is receiving the placebo and who is receiving
the effective treatment, the members do not know which outcome to expect. Thus,
the purely psychological effects of the treatment can be assumed to be the same in
both groups and thus eliminated as a cause of different outcomes. Eventual differ-
ences between the test group and the control group can then be attributed to the
administered medicine.
It follows from the above discussion that if we want to talk about objective
scientiﬁc facts, we should restrict ourselves to only those statements that can be
expressed by occasion sentences in order to limit the extent to which theory colours

our judgments. Similarly, we should be careful in saying that a hypothesis/theory is
proven, as it is always possible to reinterpret the empirical data hitherto used to
support that theory. This possibility is sometimes utilised during scientiﬁc revolu-
tions, where one begins to ‘see reality’ from a wholly new perspective. A classic
example is the Copernican revolution.
Before Copernicus, it was generally believed that the Earth lay motionless at the
centre of the universe. The thought that the Earth could rotate around its axis was
rejected by the following simple observations: If you throw an object straight up
into the air, it will fall in the same place from where it was thrown. If the Earth
rotated, then the object would fall some distance away from where it was thrown,
since the Earth would have moved while the object was in the air. However, this is
not the case, as this simple observation is supposed to show. What Galilei did, in his
campaign against the traditional view that the Earth is ﬁxed in the centre of the
universe, was to interpret this experiment in a different way. He introduced the
concept of relative motion and a different deﬁnition of the concept of force. Since
the days of Aristotle, it was believed that force is required to maintain motion, and
that motion ceases in the absence of force. Galilei claimed that motion with
constant speed does not require a preserving force. From this it follows that when
we throw an object into the air, the object follows the Earth’s rotation even when it
has left the hand of the thrower. The Earth and the thrown object rotate with the
same speed; and so the object falls in the same place from which it was thrown,
given that it was thrown vertically.
This example shows that we sometimes discard a theory or hypothesis without
making any new observations. As in the previous example, we sometimes ‘merely’
interpret old observations in a new way. Such reinterpretation is nothing other than
a change of one’s auxiliary assumptions. In the case of the thrown object above, the
essential point is what one means by force. Do forces cause motion, or do they
cause changes in motion? In the argument against the Earth’s rotation, the sentence
‘a force is required to maintain motion’ is an auxiliary assumption. This view is so
natural that one is easily led to claim that one can ‘see’ that the Earth does not move
when an object thrown upward falls precisely from where it was thrown. (The most
profound change from Aristotelian to Galilean theory of motion is the conceptual
change from the idea ‘force causes motion’ to the idea ‘force causes change of
motion’.)
Again, a theory or hypothesis can be strong, believable and very probable, and
yet the cautious would refrain from saying that it is veriﬁed. Our knowledge is
always provisional, more or less.
A sceptic would draw a different conclusion; namely, that we can never know
anything with certainty and that all propositions can be doubted. The latter is
correct, but one cannot doubt everything simultaneously. For, every time we
doubt a proposition, that doubt is based upon another proposition (or more) that
we take to be true. Our epistemological standpoint should thus be described using
sentences of the form ‘I do not believe in p because I hold that q is true, and q’s truth
supports the belief that not-p is true’. It is certainly possible to replace p with any
statement whatsoever, but this does not imply that one can doubt everything at the
76

same time. Even if there is no secure foundation for the empirical sciences, it is
reasonable to assume that most of what we believe is true, while some of the
propositions we take to be true are false.
4.5
Observations and History: On Source Criticism
Questions regarding the reliability and theory-dependence of observations are given
a different character when applied to history. Students of history do not observe
historical events, in the strict sense of the word. However, they do observe the
various remains (e.g. bones, tools, and ruins) as well as narrative sources
(e.g. letters, ledgers, and other writings). Only after interpreting and evaluating
these historical sources do they discern the historical facts. In turn, these historical
facts become the basis of various historical hypotheses.
History as an academic discipline underwent a profound change at the end of
nineteenth century, ﬁrst in Germany. The method of sourch criticism was intro-
duced by
Leopold von Ranke, (1795–1886), who was professor at Humboldt
University in Berlin for a long time. Here is a brief exposition of the main
principles.
It is fairly obvious that one cannot accept the contents of letters, reports, or
minutes as historical facts without proper analysis. Consider, for example, a letter in
which the author describes a historical event. One can pose a number of questions
as to the truth of this letter. These questions are usually ordered into three groups;
proximity, bias and dependence.
Proximity
The ﬁrst question regards the sources’ proximity to the described event;
did the author of the source see the event take place? How much time has passed
between the acts of observation and their recording? We all know that the memory
is notoriously untrustworthy; when describing an event that took place many years
ago, it is doubtful that the resulting description will be accurate. Even worse are
those descriptions written by people who did not observe the event themselves, but
merely relate another person’s observations. We are naturally led to two rules of
thumb: (i) if possible, use sources that are contemporary with the events in question,
and (ii) that are ﬁrst-hand. Of course, these two principles can conﬂict. A contem-
porary source can be a second-hand source, and a ﬁrst-hand source can fail to be
contemporary. However, experience has shown that if these two principles conﬂict,
then the contemporary second-hand source is usually more reliable than the later
primary source.
Bias
The next point in the critical evaluation of sources regards the author’s
intentions with respect to what he is writing. It is possible that the purpose of the
text is to impress a particular view upon the reader, rather than give an objective
description of the events concerned. A classic example from Sweden’s history is
Erik Dahlbergh’s account of the Swedish army’s crossing of ‘Det Store Bælt’ (The
Big Straight) in Denmark, in the year 1658. (Erik Dahlbergh (1625–1703) was a
4.5
Observations and History: On Source Criticism
77

Swedish soldier, ﬁnally ﬁeld marchal). That year the winter was very cold in
Scandinavia, so cold that the Big Straight froze and made it possible for the
Swedish army to march towards Copenhagen and conquer Denmark. In his
so-called ‘diary’,5 Dahlbergh describes the event as if he is one of the central actors
of this brave military action. This ‘diary’ was long considered a reliable document.
In modern times, however, this account has been proven false. Dahlbergh’s ‘diary’
is a retrospective construction, written long after the events transpired. It is now
seen as an important part of Dahlbergh’s campaign to promote his own views and
boost his reputation. Critical analyses of this kind are based on an author’s personal
bias and aim to pinpoint the intentions for writing his or her work. Thus any content
that expresses, or is in line with, the author’s personal bias is automatically
discarded from a historical study, unless that bias is the subject of particular
investigation.
Dependence
A third form of source criticism regards the possibility that the author
was instructed, threatened, or otherwise forced into producing the source. Note that
this includes situations in which the author is unconsciously coerced, as in the case
of societal conventions. For instance, modern historians do not believe accounts of
witchcraft, coitus with the devil, or religious miracles, as these phenomena conﬂict
with general scientiﬁc knowledge and can be satisfactorily explained in psycho-
logical terms. Another example is found in the Marxist repertoire. Contained in the
Marxist perspective is the view that a person’s reasons for his actions are secondary
effects of objective, material and societal processes. Such a critique is based on the
notion that actions of agents are determined by objective historical processes. Thus
according to the Marxist perspective, the reasons and arguments an agent gives for
her actions or points of view are not relevant, no matter whether she is honest or not.
Motives are not historical causes. (Opponents of Marxism were therefore, by
deﬁnition, deemed representatives of the bourgeoisie, and therefore unable to see
the truth. This is a typical argumentum ad hominem!) This source criticism thus
builds upon the author’s dependence on various norms, values, assumptions, his-
torical mechanisms, etc. Furthermore, it is this dependence that makes us doubt the
truth of the author’s statements.
It is apparent that the utilization of these principles of source criticism in
particular cases leaves plenty of room for the historian’s personal judgment. Can
one then truly say that what is left after a critical source evaluation of some
historical material is indeed historical fact? It depends on what one means by
‘fact’. If we equate fact with ‘considered to be a fact’, then it is so by deﬁnition.
However, if by ‘fact’ we mean the content of true statements, then it is not the case.
5 An analysis of the paper in the diary shows that it could not have been written earlier than the
1670s, though it was probably written much later. The book draws on actual diaries and almanacs
that Dahlbergh authored, but the contents of the so-called diary do not agree with other descrip-
tions of the crossing. See Englund, P. (2000). Den o€overvinnerlige: om den svenska stormaktstiden
och en man i dess mitt. Atlantis, p. 565.

On Scientiﬁc Data

This is in no way unique to the historical sciences. In all empirical sciences one
is painfully aware that what is presently considered secure fact can later show itself
to be false. Truth exists, but we do not have any guarantees of ﬁnding it.
Whether history treats its material as a source or as relics is not a trivial matter.
An informative text can be entirely unreliable as regards the events described
therein, but it may still be useful as an expression of the author’s attitudes, values
and beliefs. An example from Thucydides’ The Peloponnesian War should illus-
trate this point. Pericles, eulogizing over the fallen soldiers, describes the norms and
habits of Athenian citizens:
Nor are these the only points in which our city is worthy of admiration. We cultivate
reﬁnement without extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy; wealth we employ
more for use than for show, and place the real disgrace of poverty not in owning to the fact
but in declining the struggle against it. Our public men have, besides politics, their private
affairs to attend to, and our ordinary citizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry,
are still fair judges of public matters; for, unlike any other nation, regarding him who takes
no part in these duties not as unambitious but as useless, we Athenians are able to judge at
all events if we cannot originate, and, instead of looking on discussion as a stumbling-block
in the way of action, we think it an indispensable preliminary to any wise action at all.
Again, in our enterprises we present the singular spectacle of daring and deliberation, each
carried to its highest point, and both united in the same persons; although usually decision is
the fruit of ignorance, hesitation of reﬂection. But the palm of courage will surely be
adjudged most justly to those, who best know the difference between hardship and pleasure
and yet are never tempted to shrink from danger.6
If we ask what the text says about Thucydides’ view on Athenian life, instead of
questioning the accuracy of what Pericles said, or even if it was Pericles who said it,
we are not treating the text as an informative source, but rather as an ancient relic
that tells us something about how the Athenians saw themselves. Such a treatment
can be just as interesting as asking what Pericles actually said.
4.6
Summary
All empirical sciences are tested against data in the form of observation reports. For
such testing to meaningful, observation reports must be independent of the theory to
be tested. This can be achieved, although observation reports, in the usual sense of
the word, often are theory-laden to some extent. It is crucial for the objectivity and
trustworthiness of any science that data are acceptable as such both by friends and
foes of the particular theory, which is tested by those data.

Qualitative Data and Methods
We classify as we can. But we do classify.
Claude Levi-Strauss
5.1
Introduction
The term ‘qualitative method’ refers to a number of rather different scientiﬁc
methods within the human and social sciences, such as Hermeneutics, Grounded
Theory, Phenomenology and Ethno-methodology. The contrast to ‘qualitative’ is
‘quantitative’; Qualitative methods aim at the collection and analysis of
non-quantitative, i.e. qualitative data. But what does this amount to?
As we saw in the previous chapter, if one wants to make a quantitative compar-
ison between collected data, then these data must be such that one can at least
compare differences between observations. That is to say, it must be meaningful to
ask oneself if the difference between the items o1 and o2 is greater, or lesser, than
that between o3 and o4. There are many cases within the humanities and the social
sciences in which it is either impossible, or inadequate, to make such comparisons.
For example, take Emile Durkheim’s concept of degree of integration in a society
discussed in Chap. 3. Naturally, one must measure various variables, such as how
many parties or holidays are celebrated in a society during a year, in order to get
some sort of measure of the degree of integration. However, no single variable will
be sufﬁcient for a good picture of the degree of integration. One must somehow sum
over all the variables studied such that each addition is based on some more or less
arbitrary rule for how the different factors are to be weighed. Hence it is not
meaningful to operationalize the concept degree of integration to an extent that
results in an interval, or quotient scale. One must be satisﬁed with the ability to
make a rank ordering. Another way saying the same thing is to point out that ‘the
degree of integration’ is not a quantitative concept, even though it may appear to be.
Those that use qualitative methods do not usually motivate their choice of
method by arguing that quantitative measurements cannot be made. Rather, they
argue that the particular phenomena under investigation, and the associated ques-
tions one may pose, are qualitative in nature. In these situations, one does not want
to ﬁnd out how much of something there is, but rather what type of character

something has. For example, a hermeneutic would perhaps want to interpret the
content of a historical or literary text, while a phenomenologist would want to
research how certain individuals experience their existence, their life and the world
around them.
To say of something that it is thus and so is to decide which concepts the
particular phenomenon falls under. To make such a decision is to make a classiﬁ-
cation. We can thus draw the conclusion that qualitative methods can be charac-
terized by the fact that the data being collected are classiﬁed; that is, qualitative
observations form a nominal scale. But this is not sufﬁcient for a deﬁnition of the
qualitative method, since this characterization is too broad. By this deﬁnition, the
determination of blood types would count as a qualitative method. In one sense, it is
obvious that the determination of someone’s blood type is a measurement that
results in a qualitative statement. However, the term ‘qualitative methods’, as it is
normally used, means something different.
It strikes me that all qualitative methods have yet another thing in common;
namely, that the phenomena one is studying are meaningful, and the primary aim of
qualitative methods is to identify the meaning or signiﬁcance of texts, symbols,
actions, and so forth. Meaning and signiﬁcance are concepts that belong to the
intentional realm. Therefore, I propose the following deﬁnition of qualitative
method:
Deﬁnition of qualitative method: A scientiﬁc method is qualitative if and only if it
aims at the classiﬁcation of phenomena with respect to categories containing an
explicit, or implicit, intentional component.
But what is meant by ‘meaningful’, ‘signiﬁcance’ and ‘intentional’?
5.2
Intentionality and Meaning
The word ‘intention’ is often treated as synonymous with ‘purpose’ or ‘aim’.
Intentions are involved in human actions. However, within philosophy ‘intention’
has been given a broader meaning. The philosopher Franz Brentano (1838–1917)
observed that all descriptions of mental phenomena can be analysed into two
components: the mental act and the content. When Lisa says ‘I hope we will have
a nice summer’, the mental act is the act of hoping, and it has the content ‘we will
have a nice summer’. One cannot hope for nothing in particular. One must hope for
something deﬁnite; that is, the act of hoping must have content. This content,
towards which the act is directed, is often called the act’s intentional object.
Brentano held that all mental phenomena are thus directed towards an intentional
object.
Most, or perhaps all, mental states fall into the following three groups:
•
perceptions,
•
emotions,
82
5
Qualitative Data and Methods

•
propositional attitudes (believing, hoping, wishing, thinking, etc.).
All of these mental acts are in a certain sense directed towards an object. When
we observe we direct our attention to some object, which becomes the intentional
object. (There is an important distinction to keep in mind here: sensations are not,
while perceptions are, object-directed. Pain is a sensation not a perception, since
there is no object towards which the pain is directed (headache is not pain directed
towards the head, it is a type of pain), while seeing e.g. a fox is a perception.) Our
emotions are also directed: we are mad at someone, thankful for the presents, and
anxious over the impending examination. In all these situations, we indicate the
intentional component of the mental phenomenon with a preposition followed by a
description of the object of intention, towards which the mental act is directed.
Finally, propositional attitudes such as believing, hoping, knowing and wishing are
directed. The object toward which an attitude is directed is more often called its
‘content’ and is expressed by the proposition following the word ‘that’. Such
propositions may even contain objects of fantasy such as Santa Claus or Hamlet.
(There is a philosophical problem with the semantics of sentences where such
objects are non-existent; but this is beyond the scope of the present discussion.)
Propositional attitudes are closely connected to actions; usually we call some-
thing done ‘an action’ when we take for granted that it is connected to a belief or
conscious desire. When we think that the doing is not associated with any belief or
conscious desire we call it behaviour. Hence, we should distinguish between action
and behaviour: actions always have an intentional component, whereas behaviours
don’t.
Choosing to do nothing in a given situation with the intent that some event will
take its course without interference can also be considered an act precisely because
the agent has a belief about what will happen, and a desire that the expectation
materialize.
We can thus describe all mental phenomena by indicating the mental act being
performed and the object towards one’s mind is directed. Directedness, or inten-
tionality, is a necessary component of mental acts.
Meaningful phenomena are phenomena that either contain an intentional com-
ponent themselves, or else are more indirectly constituted by an intentional prop-
erty. Thus actions, and the results of those actions, are meaningful phenomena in
the same way as texts, social institutions and conventions, values, norms and
artefacts. This is because all of the above phenomena are either directly constituted
by intentions (collective intentions constitute social institutions, as will be
discussed in Sects. 5.8 and 5.9), or the result of such intentions.
How is one to research the meanings – the intentional components – of these
phenomena? Can they be observed? Do they exist per se, or are they created in the
very act of observation? I shall attempt to illuminate these questions in the follow-
ing three examples.
1. A stone found during a stroll through the woods seems, at least at ﬁrst, to have no
meaning. Yet, if we look closer, we may ﬁnd that it is not just any old stone, but
that it shows signs of having been formed by human hands. This unusual shape
5.2
Intentionality and Meaning
83

gives the stone a sort of meaning. Though we may not be able to give details as to
what that meaning is, we can observe that it has meaning in that its form is the
result of conscious human action. Once we have convinced ourselves that this
form is human-made, we ask ourselves, what is this meaning; why does the stone
have this particular shape? Is the stone a tool or a cultural expression? In asking
such questions we assume that someone had a particular purpose in mind when
he, or she, crafted the stone. It is an archaeologist’s job to interpret the stone’s
features in order to discover what this purpose was; thus allowing us to under-
stand how the stone was used (e.g. to clean animal hides).
Does this stone have meaning that we discover, or is it that the stone only
acquires a meaning once it has been studied? Difﬁculties arise here from
common language use as well as ontological assumptions. If we say that the
stone has meaning that we can discover, then this meaning is a property of the
object, which is independent of the observer. If, instead, we say that the stone
acquires a meaning for us, then this meaning is more likely a relation between
the observer and the stone. One cannot then say that the stone has any meaning in
itself, but rather that meaning arises in the observer’s interaction with it. In this
case, I think it reasonable to say that the stone has meaning; namely, its function
with respect to the way humans used it. We can ﬁnd, or fail to ﬁnd, this meaning,
but we should note that the stone’s meaning is not a physical property of the
stone like its mass or shape, but rather an intentional one.
2. The meaning of certain actions and artefacts is a much more difﬁcult question.
Money is an everyday example of this difﬁculty. Certain physical objects such as
thin cylindrical pieces of metal, small printed notes, and electronic currency are
considered to be money. However, the monetary value of these objects is not a
physical property of them. Of course, a 10 £ banknote must have certain
distinctive physical features, such as the print of a 10 £ pound note. Yet, it is
not the print that gives the money its value. Rather, it is a collective agreement,
or attitude, that constitutes its meaning. When a country suffers inﬂation, this
collective attitude changes dangerously as people loose faith in their currency.
Even though no physical aspects of the monetary objects have been changed, the
normal value still goes down. This shows that what changes is, in fact, the
collective attitude.
Most of the time, these collective attitudes are unconscious. We do not
normally think of banknotes as pieces of paper that have come to be treated as
money by way of a collective agreement. It is hardly ever the case that someone
thinks, ‘I am handing over a piece of paper, and I recognize that everyone
considers this piece of paper to be money’. One cannot look at a banknote, or
an electronic currency statement, and see what makes it money. In order to
determine what makes certain objects money we must observe how people
interact with these physical objects, or physical states (electronic currency is a
physical state of a bank’s computer). For example, it was through direct obser-
vation of Bosnia and Croatia during the war from 1991 to 1996 that we could see
how the Deutsche Mark and cigarettes were treated as money, but the ofﬁcial
Yugoslavian Dinar was not. The Dinar had lost all its value.

Qualitative Data and Methods

Assuming that collective intentions, on which social institutions are founded,
are ﬁctitious creations of a researcher describing these social institutions, we are
faced with the possibility of not being able explain a large number of phenomena
and human behaviour. From a methodological point of view, these collective
intentions play a role similar to that of electrons in physics. We cannot directly
observe electrons1 or intentions; yet, we have good reasons to believe that both
exist. If we were to assume that, for example, electrons do not exist, then a large
number of observable phenomena would be nearly impossible to explain or
understand. Similarly, it is rational to assume the existence of collective inten-
tions as the constitutive elements of social institutions, since this assumption
allows us to understand many aspects of the human social behaviour. Thus it is
reasonable to say that the meaning that social institutions have, i.e. the collective
intentions behind them, both exist and their effects can be observed. Importantly,
the institutions so spawned are not the result of a single individual’s intention-
ality, but rather their meaning is shaped by the interaction of many. It is this
collective aspect that ensures objectivity and observer-independence of these
kinds of social institutions. In summary, we can recognize a particular social
institution by observing how people relate to each other and the physical objects
with which they interact.
3. Finally, there is a class of phenomena for which there are three very different
positions regarding their meaning. Examples of this class notably include works
of art. The meaning of a work of art can be (i) the intention of its creator,
(ii) some sort of inherent quality of the artefact itself, or (iii) the resonance the
artefact excites in the present culture.
Thus, the question regarding a work of art’s true meaning is ambiguous. In
particular, this is the case within the literary sciences, where one ﬁnds an on-going
discussion regarding whether inquiry into the interpretation of a literary work
should be directed at the author’s life and context, the text itself, or the work’s
interaction with its present social context. This question strikes me as regarding
what is most interesting, or fruitful, and not as a question about what is most
accurate and true.
Meaning is a type of relational property between certain physical objects and
states, a relation between one or more people and an object, state or event.
However, the researcher investigating these phenomena does not shape their mean-
ing. Meanings are objectively existing phenomena in so far as they are properties of
social reality that exist independently of what the researcher, or any other single
person, thinks; they are collective phenomena. So statements about these phenom-
ena are true or false, independently of what the researcher, or any other individual
believes; thus, such statements are objective. Searle2 coined this epistemic
1 Physicists nowadays claim that they observe electrons, but obviously they mean that they observe
electrons using highly advanced technology based on quantum mechanics. So the ’observation’ is
highly indirect.

objectivity. Another form of objectivity observed by Searle is the ontic; some things
exist in subject’s minds, others exist in the world and would continue to do so were
there no minds at all. The former are ontologically subjective, the latter ontologi-
cally objective.
Statements about social meaning are epistemically objective. But social meaning
could not exist without the existence of individual minds having intentions and
beliefs. Should we then draw the conclusion that social meaning is ontologically
subjective? Searle’s answer is yes.3
Since propositions concerning these phenomena are objectively true or false, it is
possible, in principle, to analyse them, and thus make objective statements about
them. I write ‘in principle’ because it is sometimes impossible to know what
someone who has long since been dead intended in regards to some action. Yet, it
is clear that this person had some intention in regards to his or her action; hence,
propositions concerning this intention are objectively true or false regardless of
whether we can ever know them.
This conclusion is not generally accepted. From the fact that all the phenomena
above are social constructions, some draw the conclusion that objective proposi-
tions regarding these phenomena are not possible. I shall discuss this counter-
argument and the various interpretations of social constructions in Sect. 5.9.
Given this discussion of intentionality, it is now appropriate to investigate a
couple of examples of qualitative methods that exemplify the general discussion
surrounding intentionality and qualitative methods. These methods are hermeneu-
tics and grounded theory.
5.3
Hermeneutics
Hermeneutics is often characterized as a tradition of research aimed at how one
reaches an understanding of various phenomena, such as texts or historical events.
According to a number of hermeneuticians, understanding requires empathy, the
ability to place oneself in another person’s situation. This is the central thesis of
R. G. Collingwood,4 see his (1994).
We often use the word ‘understanding’ in a different sense. We can, for example,
ask someone if he understands Relativity Theory. In such a case, we cannot attain
understanding through some hermeneutical process, but rather through describing
the logical connections between concepts in the theory and how it is to be applied to
concrete physical situations. Understanding in the hermeneutical sense is some-
thing else, viz., the understanding of the meaning of something that is bestowed
with an intention, a human, a group of humans, or the product of human actions. To

understand a human is thus to understand what he or she wants to express or achieve
through his or her various actions, writings, or art.
Understanding in the second sense is attained through interpretation. Herme-
neutics rightly stress that no interpretive process starts ‘from scratch’. Rather, we
always approach the unknown with some preconceptions. These may concern what
counts as an explanation, how people typically think and act, and what linguistic or
conceptual frameworks are applicable in the speciﬁc case. From these preconcep-
tions we make a preliminary, and often crude, interpretation that forms a starting
point for further studies. These further, more detailed, investigations can either
strengthen our preliminary interpretation, or lead to their revision. Thus in the
process of interpretation, one begins with an initial conception of the whole and
then uses this to inform a more detailed study of the parts. This detailed study of the
parts then serves to inform a reassessment of the whole, which then serves to inform
a re-evaluation and deepening of the study of the parts, and so on. This shifting of
focus from interpreting the whole to studying the various parts and back again is
referred to as a hermeneutic circle. This circularity ceases when the process of
interpretation attains a sufﬁcient degree of coherence between the interpretation of
the parts and the whole. (There are other formulations of the goal of a hermeneutic
process, but I shall not discuss them here.)
Thus, the central activity of hermeneutical research is interpretation. But what is
the link between interpretation and classiﬁcation?
Firstly, the practicing hermeneutic must determine a limit as to the kinds of
phenomena that have meaning. This is, in effect, a classiﬁcation. Sometimes there
are interesting borderline cases; one such is so-called hysterical diseases. Paralysis
of the arm or leg without any apparent physiological cause was interpreted by
Sigmund Freud5 as a hysterical disorder. Freud considered this kind of illness as an
unconscious reaction to conﬂicts with respect to some unbearable social situation.
Since his patients were predominately upper class women, he believed these
symptoms to be manifestations of an unconscious plea for attention. In 1900,
upper class women in Vienna, where Freud lived, were constrained to a ﬁxed
way of life. Their only purpose consisted in producing heirs for their husbands
and acting as decoration in social situations, which did not leave much room for
personal goals and requirements. Thus, Freud heard a cry for help: care about me, I
am important, I need to be taken seriously! A hysterical disease was thus a means to
gain attention and, given that Freud treated such cases as phenomena with meaning,
required interpretation. According to modern physiological studies, however, hys-
terical diseases are actually injuries in the motor-skill centre of the brain, which
controls the function of the extremities. This would appear to refute Freud’s theory,
but is that true? Could it be that the very social situations in which the afﬂicted
women found themselves were the causes of their brain injuries? This dispute
touches upon the fundamental question as to whether or not these diseases have

London, who started psychoanalysis.

meaning; and thus also upon the question as to whether or not one should regard
psychology as a human or natural science.
In my opinion, it seems that the question regarding whether to describe these
states in terms of mental or physiological terms is purely a matter of appropriate-
ness. Once we know more about such phenomena we will, I think, come to
understand that they are merely two different ways of describing the same thing;
mental phenomena are physical phenomena, although described in psychological
terms. More about this in Chap. 12.
The ﬁrst classiﬁcation the hermeneutic makes is thus the determination of what
can be the object of interpretation. However, the eventual process of interpretation
is itself a sequence of classiﬁcations. Let us examine an example from Swedish
history to illustrate this point. The document that established the so-called Kalmar
union between Sweden, Denmark and Norway, written on July 20, 1397, contains a
number of irregularities. First, it is not written on parchment, but on paper, which
was highly unusual for important documents of the time. Furthermore, several seals
of important persons are missing. Interestingly enough, it was only 7 days earlier,
on July 13, 1397, that these persons had signed and attached their seals to the
so-called coronation letter in favour of king Erik of Pomerania. Given these
anomalies, the hermeneutic historian asks the following: are they historically
signiﬁcant, or are they purely circumstantial? Furthermore, if these anomalies are
signiﬁcant, then what do they signify? Should we interpret them as the silent protest
of certain groups in Sweden and Norway against queen Margareta’s claims to the
throne (Erik was under-age after all), or as something else? There are a number of
further classiﬁcations that remain to be made.
An important problem in connection with the hermeneutical method is the
choice of criteria for accurate interpretation, which I shall discuss more generally
in Sect. 5.8.
Without delving deeper into a discussion about hermeneutical methods, we can
conclude that such methods involve classiﬁcations of meaningful material with
respect to intentional categories.

Grounded Theory

a

by
Symbolic
Interactionism, whose ontological thesis is that social interaction is an exchange
of meaningful symbols. In Grounded Theory, this thesis is applied to a strong,
empirically oriented method. The starting point is a critique of the classical
sociologists’ (Marx, Weber, Durkheim) ‘grand stories’ for being too abstract and
with little connection to empirical data. Glaser and Strauss (1967), the seminal work
on Grounded theory, claim that any new theory should in contrast start from bottom
and be generated on the grounds of empirical data. Once these data has been
collected, they are treated using a method called coding, which results in a set of
categories. The method could be described as consisting of four steps6:

Qualitative Data and Methods

•
Read the text (ﬁeld notes, interviews or documents) word for word, row for row,
or at least paragraph for paragraph.
•
Always ask yourself, under which everyday, or otherwise common sense,
categories does the data in the text fall?
•
Continuously note down these categories and further data that fall under them.
•
Inspect the data and categories in order to ﬁnd possible further enriching
properties.
This collection of bullet points may seem a bit vague to the outside observer, for
one is compelled to ask what is meant by ‘data’, ‘categories’, and the properties
thereof. It is obvious that we need concrete examples of this method in order get a
clear picture of how it is supposed to work. However, one can perhaps make the
following reﬂections without such examples.
1. There is a clear inductive attitude in the method, and it seems taken for granted
that classiﬁcation of data into categories arises naturally and without the aid of
theories.
2. The method draws on Bacon’s inductivism, in so far as classiﬁcation is said to
arise naturally via a detailed study of the empirical data. Bacon’s inductivism
has been criticized for theoretical naivety; the sorting of objects and phenomena
into categories is at least partly an active process of the mind. This critique also
pertains to Grounded Theory.
3. If one must use only those categories that are intelligible in advance, one runs the
risk that research being able to produce trivial knowledge only, since new
theories require new conceptualization.
Alvesson and Sk€oldberg (2008) share similar sentiments. After a discussion of
an example of coding they write:
The coding will, despite good intentions, not portray ‘reality’ unequivocally through an
objective, unambiguous, secure and rational procedure. On the contrary, the researcher
will, in light of his/her unconscious frames of reference, interpret what he/she sees in front
of him/her. Two problems with an unconscious frame of reference is that one advocates that
reference frame in the form of the bias that arises from common-sense classiﬁcation, and
that one places far too much energy on detailed coding.7
This is not the place for a critical investigation of the pros and cons of Grounded
Theory, but one thing is abundantly clear. That is, a central point of this qualitative
method is the classiﬁcation of empirical data. Since Grounded Theory is a method
for understanding the meaning that people give to various types of phenomena, this
classiﬁcation is done with respect to intentional categories.
Without any further discussion of other qualitative methods, I am prepared to
make the generalization that my deﬁnition of them is correct; namely, all the
methods that are normally called qualitative are captured by two deﬁning criteria:
they are classiﬁcations, and that the resulting categories are intentional.

5.5
The Intentionality of Observations
According to certain methods of research, e.g. Grounded Theory and Ethnometh-
odology, one is supposed to passively observe the object of research and then
theorize about what one has experienced. As a general methodology, this is
naı¨ve. Observation is an active mental process. It is intentional, directed towards
certain features of the perceptual ﬁeld, as well as some features that are more or less
unconscious. With every blink of the eye, our sense organs are ﬂooded with
impulses, and the brain’s ﬁrst task is to sort out most of them so that we can
focus our attention. (There are tragic examples of people that, more or less, lack this
selectiveness; they register all impressions but are unable to sort them regarding
salience and to use them for any purpose.) The question arises, ‘Of all the impres-
sions our sense organs take in, what is sorted out, and on what grounds is this done?
How do our intentions govern our perceptions? All we presently know about the
answer to these questions is that it can probably be given a general description in
evolutionary terms. The ability to direct one’s attention toward features in the
environment relevant for survival and reproduction is a consequence of natural
selection. Of course, we humans often direct our attention towards things other than
those required for survival, but the important point is that at some time we
developed a nervous system that has the ability of focusing our attention on a
great variety of things. It is correct that observation is governed by the observer’s
cultural frames of reference, but it is based on this fundamentally biological aspect
of observation, viz., that it is selective and goal-directed.
This gives strong empirical evidence for the assumption that we are unable to
observe without any presupposed concepts, or rather, observation by its nature is
application of concepts.8 This does not mean that one is in possession of articulate
hypotheses about possible observations, nor that we should not endeavour to rid
ourselves of prejudice and expectation to the maximum extent possible. Further-
more, it does not mean that initial data has no role to play in guiding test hypothesis
choice; initial preconceptions and test-hypotheses, though related, are distinct
entities.
In the previous chapter observation was analysed as a three-step process; (i) to
acquire phenomenal experiences; (ii) to synthesize these experiences into an object;
and (iii) to recognize this object as an object of a speciﬁc kind. The second step in
this process introduces the directedness of the act of perception, that perception by
its nature is object-directed. This directedness encompasses the ability to focus
one’s attention on an object in the ﬁeld of perception, and to distinguish it from
the rest.
The object-directedness of perception is rather obvious when we think of visual
perception, but perhaps less so when we consider our other senses. However, this is
8 This conclusion is similar to Kant’s view, expressed as ‘intuition without concepts is blind’.
(Critique of Pure Reason, A51, B75).

mainly due to the fact that we naturally think of visual objects, bodies and pictures,
when we read the word ‘object’. If we generalize and remember that the word
‘object’ as used in philosophical discourse means whatever can be talked about and
thus subject to predication, we may appreciate that for example hearing also is
object-directed. We hear objects such as other persons’ voices, musical themes, and
all kinds of recognizable sounds. In addition, we are all acquainted with the
phenomenon that we might hear something without listening to it. This is the
difference between having a phenomenal experience of sound and having an audial
perception.
In the previous discussion of Grounded Theory, an instruction was quoted
advocating the reading of a text word-by-word, line-by-line, and so forth. This
attention to detail may seem trivial, but it is not the physical aspects of the text one
should focus on. Rather, one should focus on the text in a way that regards it as a
linguistic entity with syntax and semantics, as well as the pragmatic aspects of the
author’s intentions, when they are relevant. However, how does one know if they
are relevant? Again, we need a preliminary theory, which can be as simple as a gut
feeling, or a purely physiologically based preconception inherent in the conscious
act of perception. Thus, observation is not entirely unbiased.
In summary, the process of observation is the transformation of a collection of
qualitative aspects of experience into objects. These objects can often be recog-
nized as objects of a speciﬁc type (cats, cars, events, etc.), and once we have
reached this third step in the observation process, we are mature enough to
formulate any number of observational statements.
The central philosophical question in this discussion is whether one can say that
the perception of an object is entirely theory-neutral or not. Personally, I am
inclined to answer that the perception of a physical object is, in most cases, the
same process for all people regardless of cultural or theoretical predispositions. The
main argument is based on observations of language learning, both in the case of the
children’s learning its native language and of anthropologist’s learning the language
of native cultures. An extreme example is learning the language of some tribe in the
Amazonas or in Papua New Guinea. Some of these tribes still live as gathers-
hunters with almost no contact with western civilisation. Despite great cultural
differences and without any previous knowledge about their beliefs, anthropolo-
gists are able to learn their language and to communicate with them. How could that
process begin? It seems utterly plausible that one must do the same as when one
learn small children the ﬁrst words; one begins with words for physical objects in
the immediate surrounding, point to them and say the word and encourage by
gestures the other to say something in his language. If you want to know the natives
word for ﬁsh, you may point to some ﬁshes and say ‘ﬁsh’ and encourage the other to
say a word in his language. Perhaps he has no general term corresponding to ‘ﬁsh’
but only for different species of ﬁsh; but that will sooner or later be discovered by
5.5

the anthropologist. This would not work if not both parties discerned the same
physical objects in their surroundings.9
In the previous chapter I suggested that if there is doubt about whether a given
observation has been made, it is always possible to make use of more primitive
formulations in the verbal expression of that observation. It is always possible to
derive a sufﬁciently primitive observational statement such that two researchers can
agree to it, no matter how much their theoretical backgrounds differ. This applies
just as well to qualitative research. For, in many cases it is easy to agree as to the
words contained in a text, or – for that matter – what the text says, even if one
disagrees about how this information should be interpreted. There are hardly any
theory-independent observations, in an absolute sense, if by the word ‘observation’
we mean the aforementioned three-step process. However, theoretical disagreement
at the third level does not entail disagreement at the lower level of observation.
When we study raw data, or make observations, we formulate observational
statements. Every such statement is a declarative sentence. Declarative sentences
are comprised of an individual term and a predicate (see Appendix). The individual
term refers to the observed object, which can be a physical object, a person, an act, a
smell or a text, anything that can be identiﬁed and re-identiﬁed as the same thing.
The predicate, on the other hand, is a general term that describes a property that
several objects may have, or a relation between objects. The result of an observation
is thus the claim that the observed object satisﬁes a certain predicate. This corre-
sponds to the third step, the recognition of an object. The application of a predicate
to an object is thus a classiﬁcation, since one is sorting that object into the ﬁrst of the
two categories (i) those that satisﬁes the predicate, and (ii) those that do not. In other
words, observational statements are the result of classiﬁcations. The interesting
question is now: Are these classiﬁcations correct, informative, interesting or useful?
The French cultural anthropologist Claude Le´vi-Strauss (1908–2009) observed
that all humans, scientists and ‘primitive peoples’ alike, classify. The difference
between the two is the choice of categories. The quotation from Le´vi-Strauss at the
beginning of this chapter, ‘We classify as we can. But we do classify’, expresses
precisely this point. The difference between ‘modern’ scientiﬁc thinkers and so
called primitive people is not that the former make classiﬁcations of phenomena
that the latter are unable to make, but that one makes classiﬁcations according to
different criteria. Doing science is to categorize phenomena in a more useful and
considered way.
Are the scientiﬁc classiﬁcations more correct than those made by Amazonian
natives (Le´vi-Strauss’ speciﬁc ﬁeld of research)? Classiﬁcations of plague and
volcanic eruptions as expressions of the will of the Gods seem ‘primitive’ to us
and thus incorrect. But is it not likely that ‘primitive’ peoples would reject our
9 Quine argued in his (1960) that one cannot determine which ontology the native has only by
agreeing on translation of complete sentences. So the native may not after all, view the visible
world as inhabited by physical objects. His argument is in my view convincing as far as it goes, but
there are other reasons to think that all humans cognize the visible world as inhabited among other
things, by physical objects.

scientiﬁc explanations of plague as a disease caused by transmittable microorgan-
isms, or volcanic eruptions as caused by movement of the tectonic plates, as
irrational and much more speculative than assuming gods. Is there any objective
criterion for ranking these two archetypical explanations?
The answer is that the best theory is the one that helps us predict the occurrence
of the phenomena in question, thus enabling us to take preventative action. We want
to prevent plagues and disasters, or at least be able to reliably predict when they will
occur, a goal on which most people, of all cultures, could agree. If we take measures
to prevent some disaster using a false theory, there is a chance that doing so will
make the situation even worse. A tragic example of this is the ‘black death’ of the
fourteenth century, when people would seek shelter in churches and beg God for
mercy. In the crowded quarters of a church, the plague spread more easily.
Modern science has shown itself to be superior in this way, to other modes of
thinking in many respects. However, this does not mean that all scientiﬁc theories
are correct, only that science in general is on the right path. To make scientiﬁc
classiﬁcations, in contrast to primitive ones, means making better predictions, but is
no guarantee for truth.
5.6
Are Quantitative Methods Better than Qualitative?
It is sometimes claimed that mature science is quantitative, and thus the proper
model for all scientiﬁc endeavours. It seems doubtful, however, whether such a
claim could be defended. It is certainly a big step forward to have made one’s
concepts precise enough so that quantitative comparisons are possible. A simple
example is the substitution of the quantitative concept ‘. . .higher temperature than’
for the qualitative concept ‘. . .hotter than’. However, is this precision always
desirable? Take, for example, a concept like degree of democracy. It is certainly
of relevance in political science. Can such a concept as democracy be reasonably
quantiﬁed in an uncontroversial way? I do not think so. Democracy contains many
different factors, such as fair elections between various candidates, freedom of
speech, protection of minorities, etc. A few of these factors may allow for quanti-
ﬁcation, but how shall they be weighed against each other? Can a low quantity of
one factor be compensated by a high quantity of another? Perhaps it is more
reasonable to require a certain minimal standard for all those factors that are
necessary for democracy. Yet, all this allows us to do is to categorise systems of
government into the democratic and non-democratic categories, or at best perform a
ranking. It does not allow us to compare degrees of democracy in a quantitative
scale.
It seems reasonable to say that degree of democracy is not a quantity, but rather a
multi-dimensional qualitative measure based primarily on judgment. Assigning
numerals to the relevant categories and then deciding the relative weights of each
category may quantify this judgment. However, there is no objective basis for how
these relative weights are chosen.
5.6
Are Quantitative Methods Better than Qualitative?
93

The conclusion is that it is not reasonable to say that all scientiﬁc disciplines
should strive for quantitative methods. The use of qualitative methods does not
make for a lesser or inferior science. In fact, there a many interesting scientiﬁc
questions that are discussed on the basis of qualitative data. This conclusion should
not, however, be taken as an argument for ridding certain sciences of their quan-
titative methods. For every qualitative concept, one ought to ask: Is there an
objective way of replacing the concept in question with a quantitative one? Is
there a point in doing so? During certain periods the debate in such disciplines as
sociology and pedagogy has revolved around this question. Many so-called posi-
tivists have claimed that a requirement for proper science is that one must be able to
quantify observations in an objective way, whereas critics have claimed that
attempts to quantify what is essentially qualitative in nature leads to a loss of the
core of this data; namely, its intentional aspects. According to my grasp of the
situation, one cannot take a general stance regarding this question; rather, in every
concrete situation one must ask oneself what kind of question – quantitative or
qualitative – one is trying to answer. One must ﬁrst have put forth a hypothesis
before one can decide what kind of investigation is to be done. Thus, the debate
between positivists and anti-positivists should be reformulated as a debate about
which questions and hypotheses are we interested in answering.
The positivist would then claim that qualitative hypotheses do not allow for
objective testing, since all qualitative data is based on judgments, which are
subjective in nature. Therefore, according to the positivist, only quantitative ques-
tions are worth researching. The anti-positivist would beg to differ. Hence, the
central issue in the debate between the two is objectivity.
5.7
Objectivity and the Use of Qualitative Methods
There is a general reluctance to apply qualitative methods because of their osten-
sible uncertainty. This uncertainty has nothing to do with classiﬁcation as such, but
with its intentional aspects. No one has ever argued against the determination of
blood type because it is a qualitative method (given that qualitative method is
interpreted as plain classiﬁcation), since the method of testing is extremely reliable.
The uncertainty of qualitative methods lies not in that they classify using nominal or
ordinal scales; rather it lies in the search for the correct meaning of the phenomena
in question. A condition for claiming that qualitative statements are objectively true
or false is that the object involved exists in reality, and does so independently of
observation. Thus we have come to the central ontological question: Does this
meaning, which is the goal of all qualitative research, have an independent
existence?
If one claims that all that exists are physical things in space and time, then it
immediately follows that the phenomenon in question (the meaning of something)
does not exist, since it is supposed to be a non-physical entity. However, this
premise expresses an extreme point of view, and few share it. Even a strict
94
5
Qualitative Data and Methods

physicalist like Quine accepts that there are non-physical things such as numbers,
sets and other mathematical entities. But he would not agree that there are entities
that are deﬁned in intentional terms, since he thinks that we have no clear criteria of
identity for such things. There are multiple arguments for this point of view, such as
the following. In order to claim that a certain abstract entity (e.g. the meaning of a
sentence) exists, one must be able to distinguish between the entity and its descrip-
tion or name. It follows that one must be able to determine whether two different
descriptions describe the same entity, or different entities. To do this, one must have
criteria for the identity of such entities. Quine’s view is that it is impossible to
formulate criteria for the identity of intentional entities, and he draws the conclu-
sion that such concepts should be kept out of science proper. This view is highly
controversial, and few have fully supported it, even though the requirement of
identity criteria is reasonable.
As I have previously claimed, I think that meanings exist objectively, and can be
researched in the same manner as physical things. Yet, this claim was made without
offering an explicit example of the, admittedly indispensible, criteria for the
identity of intentional entities. Unfortunately, such a discussion would be well
beyond the scope of this book.
Objectivity in the humanities and social sciences has been debated from other
points of view. Some have claimed that social phenomena are social constructions,
and that these do not objectively exist. The conclusion that many draw is that the
requirement of objectivity should therefore be abandoned. John Searle attacks this
view in his book The Construction of Social Reality. Searle introduces the concept
of social facts to emphasize the external and objective character of social phenom-
ena. These concepts, social construction and social fact, rightly deserve their own
section.
5.8
Searle on Brute and Social Facts
Searle’s most important distinction, in his (1995), is between brute facts and social
facts. A brute fact is a fact whose existence does not depend on human thoughts,
attitudes or knowledge, whereas the existence of social facts does depend on these
things. An example of a brute fact is the fact that Mount Everest is 8,848 m high.
Notice that it is not the statement itself but its content that constitutes the fact. This
brute fact – the height of Mount Everest – does not depend on whether or not
humans have measured it, nor does it depend on which sentence we choose for its
expression; for instance the same fact can be expressed as ‘Mount Everest is 29,493
feet high’. This is a different sentence; but it states the same fact. Of course, we
cannot speak about this fact without applying certain concepts and having knowl-
edge, yet the fact would hold even if no human had ever existed. The statement is
true (or perhaps false, if we have measured incorrectly), irrespective of our knowl-
edge about the height of Mount Everest. Thus, that Mount Everest is 8,848 m high is
a brute fact.
5.8
Searle on Brute and Social Facts
95

Certain other facts, on the other hand, do essentially depend upon people’s
perceptions. Suppose that you are watching a football10 match on television. It is
assumed that you believe it a fact that what you are watching is a football match that
is either being played now, or has been played in the past in the case that the feed is
not live. This football match is obviously dependent upon the existence of humans.
However, it is not enough that there exist 22 players and a ball. There must exist
referees, linesmen, spectators and many others that must agree that there is a
football match going on in order for it to be a football match. If enough people
think that it is not a football match, then it is not a football match, even though the
movements of the players are precisely the same. The remarkable thing about this
type of fact is that it seems to depend wholly on what the people involved think
about it. Searle introduced the concept of a collective intention in order to draw
attention to this joint comprehension. If many people are focused on the same
object, activity, or event, then we can talk about their collective intention.
Searle calls facts that are constituted by collective intentions social facts. Of
these social facts, the most interesting subcategory is that of institutional facts.11
Searle’s prime example of an institutional fact is the fact that certain objects and
states of affairs are considered to be money, as discussed in Sect. 5.2. If there were
no collective intentions to treat certain objects as money, then these objects would
not be money.
The structure of institutional facts is thus that something, X, counts as something
else, Y, under certain circumstances: This is a constitutive rule,12 which we can use
as an implicit deﬁnition of institutional facts:
X counts as Y in contexts C.
Where the expression ‘counts as’ expresses a collective intention; the collective
intention imposes a certain status, Y, on things previously identiﬁed as X. It is this
imposition of status that creates the institutional fact.
The basis for such constructions could also in turn be institutional facts. One
immediately asks if there must be an ultimate basis, a bottom of brute facts that are
not so constructed. Searle’s answer is yes, there must be some objects that are not
constructed; brute facts are ontologically prior to institutional facts. Institutional
facts ultimately depend on brute facts.
Other examples of social facts are ‘Kim Philby was a Soviet spy’, ‘Sweden is a
member of the E.U.’, and ‘John Doe owns shares of Google stock’.
10 Like all Europeans, by ‘football’ I do not refer to american football, but to soccer.
11 According to Searle, examples of social facts that are not institutional facts are collective actions
that do not require use of language; for example, the coordinated hunting of wolves’.
12 Searle uses here the distinction between regulative and constitutive rules. A regulative rule
regulates activities, which occur independently of the rule; for example, trafﬁc rules. Constitutive
rules, by contrast, constitute the activity, which comes into existence by the implementation of
these rules. The rules of chess are a good example; if you are not moving the pieces mainly
according to the rules, you are not playing chess.

It is an institutional fact that Sweden is a member of the E.U., since Sweden’s
membership depends on the attitudes of many people and these attitudes confer a
certain status to the kingdom of Sweden. Assume that all humans in Europe and the
E.U. suddenly decided that Sweden is not a member of the E.U. Sweden’s repre-
sentatives would not participate in the E.U.’s meetings, customs would not apply
E.U. regulations as regards the transport of goods between Sweden and
E.U. countries and the E.U. countries would not ask the Swedish government’s
opinion on internal E.U. matters. In short, everyone would act as if Sweden was not
part of the E.U. An expert in international law would perhaps say that Sweden still
has the proper documentation stating that it is a member of the E.U., but recall that
the premise was that everyone believes that Sweden is no longer in the E.U., even
legal experts. That is to say, if no one in the E.U. recognizes these documents, then
in all practicality, Sweden is not a member of the E.U. On the other hand, it makes
no difference if all documents regarding Sweden’s membership are destroyed. For
its membership is a social and institutional fact; it consists of the opinions and
actions of a large number of people. If all of these people, or the relevant part of
them, were to change their minds, then this social and institutional fact would also
change.13
Would the fact remain unchanged if only some of the people involved, but not
all, changed their minds regarding Sweden’s membership in the E.U.? Suppose that
Sweden’s government was of the opinion that Sweden was still an E.U. member,
but the French government was not. In such a case, it seems that the matter would be
decided in meetings between the heads of both governments, and if not, then at the
E.U. court. Sooner or later, the matter would be cleared up.
This discussion concerns the question whether or not a certain fact is the case;
that is, how one should characterize the relevant group of people. As far as I can see,
there is no general answer to this question, since the context determines what counts
as the relevant group. The discussion does not concern the question whether or not
an alleged fact is social or brute, but whether it is a fact at all. It is not uncommon
for one to be unsure as to whether or not an alleged social fact obtains. This
uncertainty applies to brute facts as well. After all, is Mount Everest actually
8,848 m high? Maybe its height was inaccurately measured.
Human beliefs are subjective; therefore one is tempted to say that the social fact
that Sweden is an E.U. member is also subjective. However, this conclusion is
incorrect. A social fact is essentially a state of affairs that many people consider to
be the case and act in accordance with. What many people are in agreement over is
objective in a certain sense, namely, intersubjective. One must remember that
‘objectivity’ can have more than one sense, and that one of the most common and
important is intersubjectivity.
13 The written constitution of Soviet Union fulﬁlled high demands on democracy, but in practice
the secretary-general of the communist party was dictator and all kinds of opposition to the
communist system was promptly and severely punished. The document meant nothing. On the
other hand, the constitution of UK is to a great extent not written; yet one may say that democratic
procedures are strictly upheld by all involved.
5.8
Searle on Brute and Social Facts
97

That many people are required to establish a social fact immediately raises the
question, how many? And further, if the number is not important, then what kinds of
people are required? Suppose that two people marry in secrecy at a Swedish
embassy. The only ones who know of the event are the two married people, the
ofﬁciator and two witnesses. Nevertheless, it is a social fact that this couple is
married, since the ofﬁciator was empowered, under certain conditions, to marry the
couple. In this case, one can say that the social fact that these two people are
married is established indirectly by collective agreement. We consider all people,
regardless of whether or not we know them, to be married, if they acted within the
conditions set by law.
There are interesting borderline cases where it is unclear which social fact is the
case. A typical example concerns the power of a government during a revolution.
Prior to the revolution, there are a number of social facts such as that the country has
a government. During the revolutionary process, the established structure of power
is dissolved, and after a while it is unclear what is the case. The remnants of the old
government try to re-establish their position of power using propaganda and force,
while the revolutionaries attempt to get rid of them, by force and other means.
There is no obvious line to be drawn between the fact that the country has a
government that is exercising its power and the fact that the old government and
its power are no more.
The abundance of such borderline cases has prompted some people to abandon
the concept of a social fact altogether. This is an unreasonable view. Many fruitful
concepts are somewhat unclear and have many borderline cases. One such example
is life. No one would doubt the fact that there are living things, and similarly that
there are dead things. Nevertheless, it is difﬁcult to draw a line in certain cases. For
example, is a virus a living thing? Another borderline case is prions, i.e., proteins
that are considered a likely cause of mad cow disease. Are prions living things,
despite the fact that they lack DNA?
That there are many cases in which we cannot determine whether or not an
alleged social fact is the case, does not mean that the distinction between brute facts
and social facts is unclear. Rather, it is a consequence of the variable nature of
social facts. Like all other changing things, many social facts come into being and
vanish gradually, so the matter of their existence is sometimes unclear.
In discussing the difference between subjectivity and objectivity, one sometimes
tends to forget that the line between them is drawn differently when dealing with
natural phenomena as opposed to social phenomena. In the case of natural phe-
nomena, a belief can be objectively false even though everyone shares it. It is
objectively false if this belief does not agree with reality. But in the case of social
facts, those facts are just collective beliefs and intentions. Therefore, the line
between subjective and objective, with respect to social facts, is drawn between
what one person believes and what many believe. A single person’s belief about a
social fact is subjective, but the common belief of many people is not. Rather, it is
an objective fact about which a single person can be mistaken. This mistake is in
regards to other people’s attitudes, and is objective in the same sense as a mistake
about a brute fact.

Qualitative Data and Methods

Knowledge about social facts is acquired by studying people’s beliefs and the
actions they perform in accordance with those beliefs. Naturally, this requires that
we must interpret people’s statements, actions and artefacts. There is simply
nothing else to study. It could be thought that the result of beliefs and actions,
e.g. written expressions, exist in a physical sense; and therefore, that we do not need
to interpret anything, since it is sufﬁcient merely to read the physically existing
document. However, we cannot escape the problem of interpretation when a written
expression is to be used in a concrete situation. Thus, knowledge about social facts
is acquired through the interpretation of what people say, do or write.
5.9
Social Constructions
The term ‘social fact’ is not common in discussions of social scientiﬁc method and
ontology. Instead, one often talks about social constructions (e.g. money, child-
hood, and in one book, reality14). What does this mean? As the term is normally
used, it does not seem to have a single meaning. I shall give three interpretations.
(i) With the term ‘social construction’ one sometimes wants to emphasize that the
phenomenon in question are created by a cooperative group of people. Given
that one accepts that not everything is socially constructed, the term seems to
have been introduced to mark a distinction similar to the one Searle makes
between brute and social facts. However, some claim that everything is
socially constructed, which yields a different interpretation of the term.
(ii) Sometimes people want to reject a statement as not truth-apt, with the argu-
ment that it is about a social construction. This argument presupposes that
social constructions are not real. This can be interpreted as claiming that only
physical objects and properties exist objectively. In my opinion, this view is
incorrect. Propositions about constructed things, physical artefacts or social
constructions, are just as true or false as propositions about non-constructed
things.
(iii) Among those who use the concept, there is an implicit, and at times explicit,
critique of the maxim that true sentences represent parts of reality. The
distinction between reality and the linguistic representation thereof is refuted
as untenable; thus making ‘reality’ a linguistic and therefore social construc-
tion. For example, one may hear the expression that people live in different
realities, and that there is no observer-independent reality. An interesting
confusion seems to be lingering here; for researchers and other people
whose attention is directed towards natural phenomena normally use the
word ‘reality’ to talk about the world regardless of how we perceive
it. However, researchers in the humanities and social sciences often use a

Social Constructions

phenomenological interpretation of ‘reality’ along the lines of ‘reality as it
appears to someone’. Since our perceptions and theories regarding the world
seem to be at least partially culturally dependent, it seems fair to say that
reality (in this sense) is a social construction. However, Searle’s point is, and I
wholeheartedly agree, that even these constructions are real phenomena. They
are embodied in humans (or in properties of humans) and can be articulated.
Thus, one can talk about them, hypothesize about them, and make true or false
propositions about them. In short, physical entities are not the only real
entities.
Suppose that the constructivists persevere and argue that the claim presented
above – that one could make objectively true or false statements about how people
perceive the world – is also a social construction. This would mean that one cannot
claim that a proposition is true in any other sense than that it is true for the person
stating it; that is, ‘true’ means ‘true for me’. Such a view is entirely relativistic and a
modern parallel to the sophist Protagoras’ view that everything is as it appears to the
speaker. This view was previously discussed in Sect. 2.3.1, where it was rejected
via Plato’s counter-argument showing that relativism is self-contradictory.
If we assume that reality is a social construction, then we are want to ask,
‘constructed from what?’ According to Searle’s analysis of social facts, we are to
understand these constructions as attributions of certain functions/statuses to
objects or actions. The objects to which we attribute a certain function can in turn
also be social constructions. Thus arises the question: Of what is this object a
construction? Apparently, we are left with an inﬁnite regress, if we do not accept
that there are things that are not constructed. Searle’s discussion concerns social
facts, but the same reasoning can be used in regards to social constructions. If the
concept of social construction is to have any intelligible meaning, then there must
exist things that are not social constructions.
In summary, I should say that – under certain interpretations – the concept of
social construction seems to coincide with Searle’s concept of social facts. In these
interpretations, there are no problems with objectivity. However, if one attempts to
develop a subjectivist or epistemological relativist view by claiming that everything
is socially constructed, it is possible to refute this view in the same way that Plato
refuted Protagoras’ total relativism.

Criteria for Correct Interpretations
There does not seem to be a general criterion for correct interpretation. However, in
some cases, like the example of Sweden’s E.U. membership, it can be argued that
coherence in the interpretation of all pertinent documents is the ultimate criterion.
The interpretation of central clauses in these documents must lead to unanimity.
However, this does not exclude the possibility of conﬂicting coherent interpre-
tations. This is a logical possibility, which in practice can be sidestepped given that
100
5

one treats interpretation as an on-going process. Suppose someone were to propose
a divergent interpretation of the meaning of Sweden’s agreements with the E.U.,
and further claimed that this interpretation is coherent given that one reinterprets all
other contracts regarding international cooperation etc. One could then argue that
this interpretation is incorrect, since it breaks with the historical continuity of the
interpretation of such contracts and other legal documents. Thus, the historical
continuity of human and state relations becomes the distinguishing factor regarding
different coherent, and yet conﬂicting interpretations. However, this does not solve
the problem, since a revisionist interpretation of a text can certainly contain
interpretations of earlier interpretations of that text. Thus, what is required is
consistent revision. In the end, whether a certain interpretation of a text is correct
will be decided by referendum, negotiation or by force. A good example illustrating
this point is the Swedish judicial system, in which the Supreme Court has been
mandated to interpret laws and the concepts applied therein. (It is the same in many
other countries.) Thus some laws, or parts of laws, are construed by the interpre-
tations made by the Supreme Court.
Another way of expressing this point is that the ultimate criterion for correct
interpretation is determined by how all people involved comprehend their social
relations. The coherence requirement therefore, in this case, translates to the
requirement that the interpretation is accepted by (almost) all actors involved.
This criterion is called the actor’s criterion.
It is, however, not always the actor’s, or actors’, own comprehension that
determines the ultimate criterion. Take, for example, one of Shakespeare’s plays.
When the play is to be performed at the theatre, the director must interpret the text
in order to determine the point of the play. If we were to require the actor’s criterion
in such a case, then the author’s intentions would be indicative of whether the
director correctly interpreted the play. Of course, it is not necessary that director
interpret the play exactly as Shakespeare intended. Thus, one cannot claim that the
director misinterprets the play. However, this does not lead to any sort of relativism.
The question ‘what is the point of Shakespeare’s play’ has a deﬁnite answer (even if
we can never know what it is), and the question ‘what is the point of the director’s
version’ may have a different deﬁnite answer. Naturally, the audience need not
accept Shakespeare’s nor the director’s interpretation. For, the concrete perfor-
mance of the play can be interpreted in a number of other ways.
The lack of a generally applicable criterion for correct interpretation is due, in
part, to the large variety of uses one may have for a given interpretation, and partly
to what Quine calls the indeterminacy of translation. It should be carefully noted
that Quine’s thesis about indeterminacy of translation is not the epistemological
point that it is impossible to know the correct translation, but the more profound
point that there are no facts of the matter determining correctness of translation.
Quine has claimed, and many have agreed, that it is possible to produce multiple
mutually exclusive translations of the same text, and nothing determines which is
the correct one.

Summary
Qualitative methods are ultimately methods for making classiﬁcations of meaning-
ful phenomena. When these classiﬁcations concern individuals, groups or institu-
tions the resulting categories are interpretations of human actions and the artefacts
produced by those actions. The question about the objectivity of these classiﬁca-
tions is thus the question about the objectivity of interpretation.
Those who claim that all interpretation is subjective and that there are no
objective facts in the human and social sciences have implicitly assumed that the
distinction between objectivity and subjectivity is construed in the same way in all
disciplines. This view is based on a confusion of two different meanings of
objective and subjective. One can use the objective/subjective distinction to mark
an ontological difference; certain phenomena are subjective in the ontological
sense, if they are contained in, or part of, an individual’s consciousness, otherwise
they are objective. But we also use the objective/subjective distinction to distin-
guish between different types of propositions. A proposition is objective if it is true
or false independent of what the speaker believes to be the case, otherwise it is
subjective. Individual’s mental states are ontologically subjective, but propositions
about these subjective things are objective in the epistemological sense. A propo-
sition is epistemologically objective if it is possible to establish criteria for the truth
or falsity of that proposition and if different people’s application of those criteria
yield the same result.
Discussion Questions
1. A central concept in Economics is utility. The everyday word ‘utility’ seems to
defy measurement, but Economics is predominately a quantitative discipline.
Discuss what conditions are required to be able to quantify utility and whether
these conditions are normally fulﬁlled.
2. A common view in Ethics is called utilitarianism, according to which we ought
to choose the action that, in the long run, provides maximum happiness to as
many people as possible. In order to realize such an ethical stance, one must be
able to compare different states of happiness. Discuss the possibilities of both
intrapersonal and interpersonal comparisons of states of happiness.

Theories About the Development of Science
‘Anything goes.’
P. Feyerabend.
6.1
Introduction
The debate about the development of science is a debate about scientiﬁc rationality.
The central question is whether there is any rationality in science, and if so, what
that rationality could be. This question has long been discussed in one form or
another.
Just after the First World War, this debate got a new focus in the work of the
Vienna Circle. The starting point for this group was a general distrust of speculative
metaphysics. Questions about reality’s true nature, what lies beyond observable
things – which were the traditional metaphysical questions – were considered
meaningless.
Today, no one accepts the Vienna Circle’s more speciﬁc doctrines; but even so,
one may say that it had a large impact on the philosophical discussion about
science. The analysis and critique of its fundamental points led to a fruitful
development of concepts and methods within the philosophy of science. In this
chapter I shall give an overview of four of the main positions on this topic: the
Vienna Circle’s program of logical positivism, Popper’s falsiﬁcationism, Kuhn’s
theory of paradigms and scientiﬁc revolutions, and Lakatos’ theory about research
programs. I shall also give a short overview of Feyerabend’s theoretical anarchism,
and, ﬁnally, I shall propose a reﬁnement of the concept of scientiﬁc rationality.
6.2
Logical Positivism
Beginning around 1920, a group of philosophers, sociologists, physicists and other
academics met regularly in Vienna to discuss questions within science. This group,
the Vienna Circle, focused their interest on the question of what is special about
science. The natural sciences, especially physics, were taken as the ideal, with their

great strides forward, while philosophy, and in particular metaphysics, trod much
the same well-worn path it had been treading for over 2000 years. The Circle
thought that one could establish a criterion that science usually fulﬁlled, but that
speculative metaphysics did not: the veriﬁability criterion, which states that a
sentence is meaningful if and only if one can describe a method to verify the
truth of the sentence. (If it proved to be false, one would then have a method for
showing that its negation is true.) It was claimed that many traditional metaphysical
propositions, often the topic of philosophical discussion of the day, did not meet
this criterion; and consequently, were strictly meaningless. In contrast, scientiﬁc
propositions invariably did meet this criterion and were thus meaningful.
This criterion is a semantic criterion. It was an important part of a general theory
of linguistic meaning to which the Vienna Circle subscribed. The main theses in this
theory are that there are only two types of meaningful sentences; analytical
sentences, which are true or false in virtue of the meaning of their words, and
synthetic sentences, which are true if they are veriﬁed and false if their negations are
veriﬁed. If a sentence cannot be placed in either of these categories, it is meaning-
less; they held this to be so even if it is syntactically well formed and where we
believe we understand its meaning.
According to the Vienna Circle, how do we verify synthetic sentences? First,
they thought that one could draw a sharp line between theoretical and observational
sentences. Obviously, or so they thought, observational sentences are veriﬁed by
making observations, the Vienna Circle saw no deep problem with this. However,
the veriﬁcation of theoretical sentences required a more worked out methodology.
The theoretical sentences in which the Vienna Circle had an interest were
generally law-like sentences of the form ‘all objects of type A have property B’.
It was thought that such sentences are veriﬁed via an inductive method. An
inductive method is a method that gives the conditions under which it is correct
to conclude a general sentence (e.g. all swans are white) from singular sentences
(e.g. swan 1 is white, swan 2 is white, etc.). This conclusion of a general law from
individual cases was deemed legitimate if the following conditions are fulﬁlled:
•
One has observed a large number of individual cases of the presumed law.
•
One has not observed any counterexamples.
•
One has observed these cases under many different circumstances.
It is obvious that the theoretical laws accepted as such in the natural sciences
normally fulﬁl these conditions. However, these conditions are not very precise.
There are two obvious problems: (i) exactly how many observations are required to
say that a law is veriﬁed, and (ii) since one cannot, or should not, worry about all
types of circumstance, which circumstances are the relevant ones? For example,
suppose that on a winter day one observes that all the swans in Stockholm’s waters
are white. Can we now draw the conclusion that all swans are white? Before we do,
it is reasonable to require that one investigate other places at different times of the
year. On the other hand, it seems unreasonable to require that one take into account
the weather or whether the king happened to be home at the Royal Castle as relevant
circumstances. This is because we are convinced that these factors are not relevant
104

Theories About the Development of Science

to the colour that a bird’s plumage takes. But how do we know? This knowledge is
supposedly based on a general theory of causal connections in nature, according to
which such factors cannot inﬂuence the colour of birds. However, this is theoretical
knowledge that we have come by through other veriﬁcations, which, in turn, must
also have met all three criteria above. Thus, we have gone round in a (Viennese)
circle.
The Vienna Circle faced another difﬁculty in regards to some very general
statements in science, such as the principle of the conservation of energy in closed
systems. How does one verify such a statement? It is so general that it applies to
absolutely every system, and so one begins to question whether it can be veriﬁed at
all. But if such veriﬁcation is impossible, then the principle of the conservation of
energy must be a metaphysical sentence lacking meaning. This is not a reasonable
conclusion. Thus, we are rather motivated to conclude that there is something
wrong with veriﬁability as a criterion of meaningfulness.
The Vienna Circle, especially Rudolf Carnap,1 reacted to this difﬁculty by
changing the way they looked at theoretical sentences. Their view, developed in
the 1930s, was that theoretical sentences are strictly meaningless, since they do not
meet the veriﬁability criterion, and thus they have no truth-value. However, they are
still used in science as logical tools for drawing conclusions about future observable
events. The idea is that one ﬁrst makes observations, formulates observational
statements that are true and hence meaningful. Then, with help of correspondence
rules and theoretical sentences (laws), one can logically infer new observational
statements that describe situations not yet observed. Theoretical sentences in
themselves do not claim anything. The theoretical terms we use do not refer to
any unobserved objects. Theoretical sentences are mere instruments for prediction,
which is why this view is called instrumentalism.
A necessary condition for holding this view is that one can maintain a very sharp
distinction between theoretical and observational sentences, as they have
completely different semantic properties. It is not enough to say that there is a
vague line between theoretical and observational sentences, since this immediately
raises the question as to whether sentences in the vague area have truth-values. This
difﬁculty was one that the Vienna Circle could not satisfactorily solve.
Despite these glaring difﬁculties, this was ‘the received view’ up until the early
1960s. It is called logical positivism, or logical empiricism, and can be recognized
as veriﬁcationism in semantics, instrumentalism in regards to theories, and
inductivism in regards to methodology.
1 Rudolf Carnap, (1891–1970), was born in Germany, but 1935 he moved to USA for political
reasons. Carnap is the leading representative for logical positivism and heir to Frege, Russell and
the early Wittgenstein.

6.3
Falsiﬁcationism
Karl Popper worked concurrently with many Vienna Circle members and some-
times participated in their meetings in the early 1920s. He agreed with some of their
critical points in regards to metaphysical speculation and saw that it was important
that one give a correct criterion for what can be called science. He was also critical
of many popular theories of the time such as psychoanalysis and Marxism, whose
supporters claimed were scientiﬁc theories. Popper argued that these supporters
were never prepared to truly and unconditionally test their theories. However,
Popper, as opposed to the members of the Vienna Circle, rejected any use of
inductive reasoning in science. He argued that Hume had once and for all shown
that the problem of induction was unsolvable. Hume’s argument goes as follows.
We often use inductive reasoning in science; we observe a number of events of type
A each followed by an event of type B, then we generalise and conclude: all
A-events are followed by B-events. In what way can this method be justiﬁed? It
is obvious that this inference is not logically valid, so logical justiﬁcation is out of
the question. Then perhaps one might say the following: throughout the ages, we
have found that inductive reasoning has quite often proved correct, even though one
cannot claim any guarantee that the conclusions are true. Hence, this justiﬁes
further use of induction. But this argument is itself an example of induction; we
have used induction in order to show that induction is a valid method, thereby
assuming that which we set out to prove. Hence, we cannot justify induction using
either our experience or logical arguments. But, then, what other method of
justiﬁcation is left? Nothing! For this reason, Hume argues, induction cannot be
justiﬁed. Hume accepted that we humans naturally use inductive reasoning, in
everyday life and in science, without justiﬁcation, but Popper did not accept that.
He held that science should be built upon rationally motivated modes of reasoning
and hence we should reject all forms of induction.2
Popper’s alternative was to build scientiﬁc reasoning on logically valid princi-
ples such as Modus Tollens. That is to say, if we infer an empirical consequence
from a number of hypotheses and this consequence proves to be false, then we have
a logically valid argument for the falsity of one or more of the hypotheses (See
Chap. 3 and Appendix).
According to Popper, we are never justiﬁed in stating that we have proved some
hypothesis, but we can say, under certain conditions, that we have conclusively
falsiﬁed some hypothesis. This is the core of Popper’s falsiﬁcationism. His meth-
odology can be summarized in the following way:
•
Put forth a hypothesis.
•
Derive the consequences.
•
Test the consequences and determine whether they are true of false.
2 One should keep in mind that mathematical induction is quite another matter: it is an axiom for
natural numbers.
106

Theories About the Development of Science

•
If any of the consequences are false, reject the hypothesis.
•
If none of the consequences is false, then provisionally accept the hypothesis.
This is largely similar to the hypothetical-deductive method described in
Chap. 3. However, there are some differences between Popper’s view and the
view I earlier expressed. In Chap. 3, I wrote, in agreement with most philosophers,
that if the empirical consequences prove to be in agreement with experiment and
observation, then one could say that the hypothesis has been strengthened. This
strengthening can be interpreted as an increase of its believability, or equivalently,
of the probability of it being true. This conclusion is inductive, since we argue from
present knowledge to future unknown events. If the hypothesis is strengthened, then
it is more probable than it was before the test that the next test will agree with the
hypothesis. But Popper cannot claim that a hypothesis that has passed many tests
has been strengthened, for then he would have to accept inductivism. Instead, he
says that the hypothesis is corroborated. According to Popper, a theory is well
corroborated if and only if it has survived many tests. It does not follow from the
proposition that a hypothesis is well corroborated that the hypothesis is highly
probable, or even that it is probable that the next attempt at falsifying it will fail.3
Popper also argues against all claims that a hypothesis is more probable after
successfully passing a test with the following argument: Every general hypothesis
(e.g. ‘All swans are white’) has a very large, and sometimes inﬁnite, number of
empirical consequences. The probability of a hypothesis is the quotient of a number
of positive instances over the number of possible instances. If the number of
possible cases is inﬁnite, then it makes no difference how many observations and
experiments with positive outcome one makes, because the quotient will always be
zero. Thus, no ﬁnite number of tests can make a hypothesis more probable than if it
had not been tested.
The question of how one ‘discovers’ good hypotheses cannot, and needs not,
concern scientiﬁc methodology. Popper drew a sharp line between ‘the context of
discovery’ and ‘the context of justiﬁcation’. According to him, there is no method
for discovering or inventing new ideas since if there were, the results of such
methods would not be genuinely new ideas or discoveries. What need justiﬁcation
are the conclusions drawn from such inspirations.
One problem with falsiﬁcationism is how it should treat the thesis that all
observational statements are theory-dependent. This problem is related to the
following: in order to say that one has falsiﬁed a hypothesis one must be able to
say that the observation on which the falsiﬁcation is based is irrefutable. However,
if this observation, in turn, depends on the truth of certain theories, such as theories
about our instruments or cognitive mechanisms involved, then one can ask whether
it is the observational statement or the tested hypothesis that is false. But this means
that we can never tell whether a hypothesis has been conclusively falsiﬁed.
3 One should be well aware that Popper here uses the word ‘corroborate’ in his own technical
sense. The usual meaning of ‘corroborate’ is ‘support’, or ‘conﬁrm’.
6.3
Falsiﬁcationism
107

Popper’s answer to this objection was to accept that observations are theory-
dependent, whilst maintaining that before we even begin to test our hypotheses we
should state what results we are prepared to accept as refutations. Thus, we are to
point out a number of so-called base propositions that should not be questioned in a
test situation (e.g. that certain instruments are reliable). Popper means that someone
who is not prepared to make this methodological decision cannot be said to have a
rational, scientiﬁc perspective. Obviously, this decision is not made once and for
all; base statements, like all other scientiﬁc statements, should be open for critical
discussion.
In my opinion this stance is entirely reasonable. However, for Popper, there is
still the problem that he cannot consistently claim that it is possible to conclusively
falsify a hypothesis. What he can say is that, given that we choose to treat a number
of statements–those necessary for deriving consequences from a hypothesis–as true,
we must hold that a hypothesis whose observational consequences conﬂict with
observations is false. This is quite different from saying that the hypothesis in
question has been falsiﬁed, since this would mean that we are certain that we know
that it is false, and not just that we take it to be false, conditional on holding other
propositions true.
Furthermore, there can be reason to point out that even the recognition of the
need to make a methodological choice undermines Popper’s strong requirements on
rationality. For, on what grounds should we make the methodological choice of
base propositions? Take, for example, the choice to consider a certain instrument to
be reliable. Why should this choice be rational? Popper can hardly claim that it is
based upon experiences of previous experiments, as this would be to use induction.
Neither can a purely logical argument sufﬁce, since logic alone cannot justify
propositions about empirical facts. But then there is no justiﬁcation at all. Hence
the choice of base statements is, according to Popper’s own norms, just as
unjustiﬁable as every inductive inference.
In my view, Popper’s falsiﬁcationism (he himself called his position ‘critical
rationalism’) is not any real alternative to inductivism, since either he rejects all
induction, thus making it impossible to motivate his methodology, or he accepts
certain inductive inferences, which is essentially a variant of inductivism.
I think that induction is and will be an important part of all scientiﬁc thinking
that aims at something more than merely describing events that have already has
occurred. Popper’s treatment of rational thought as being on par with strict logical
thought and his simultaneous requirement for strict rationality in science results in
science being reduced to pure logic, which, of course, is absurd. Nevertheless,
Popper’s methodology contains many reasonable points. As the reader surely has
noticed, I have placed signiﬁcant weight on the hypothetical-deductive method, and
Popper should be given the honour of being one those who have worked hardest to
spread this particular scientiﬁc method.

Normal Science, Scientiﬁc Revolutions and Paradigm
Shifts
In 1962, Thomas Kuhn4 published a book, The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions,
which quickly arose great interest among philosophers and other scholars. In his
book, Kuhn presents his famous theory on the development of science as consisting
of periods of normal science interrupted by scientiﬁc revolutions. The main concept
in this theory is that of a paradigm, which has been widely dispersed, and has since
come to be used in ways that Kuhn never intended. Thus, we must keep in mind that
Kuhn’s concept of a paradigm has a somewhat different meaning than is nowadays
attributed to it, but more on this later.
Kuhn described the development of a certain science in the following way. In the
beginning there was chaos; no established results to start with, no clear methods to
apply. One did not even have a particularly well-described ﬁeld of research or a list
of problems to be solved. All researchers started from scratch with a fundamental
philosophical/conceptual discussion and, since no results were indisputable, there
was no foundation on which to build meaningful development. This phase is what
Kuhn calls the pre-scientiﬁc stage.
Sooner or later a breakthrough occurs. Someone succeeds at solving a problem
and everyone considers this success to be a clear step forward. Others then try to
apply the same concepts, methods and techniques to solve new problems. If these
attempts are generally successful, then one has taken oneself out of the
pre-scientiﬁc stage and into a stage of normal science. No longer do researchers
have to start with conceptual investigations, but can begin by arguing from the
concepts, methods and results that others have already established. One is able to
continue to build on this common ground taking ever more steps forward. This
period of normal science is characterized by Kuhn as researchers working within a
paradigm, where a paradigm is a complex of results, concepts, norms and assump-
tions. In his book, Kuhn used the word paradigm in many different ways. In fact,
one critic counted 21 different deﬁnitions! In response to this critique, Kuhn, in the
appendix to the second edition of his book, replaced his concept of a paradigm with
that of disciplinary matrix, consisting of the following four components:
•
Symbolic generalizations
•
Metaphysical assumptions
•
Methodological norms
•
Exemplars
The last component, exemplars, is close to what Kuhn originally apparently
intended by the word ‘paradigm’, and it is now generally accepted that the word
‘paradigm’ in a narrow sense refers to exemplars of successful problem-solving.
4 Thomas Kuhn, (1922–1996) was an American philosopher and historian of science.
6.4
Normal Science, Scientiﬁc Revolutions and Paradigm Shifts
109

An example may illustrate the meaning of these terms. Newton’s Principia was
immediately considered a breakthrough in mechanics, the science of bodily motion.
It quickly became a paradigm for both mechanics and physics in general, and
remained so for more than 200 years.
The symbolic generalizations in this normal science are Newton’s laws. Among
the fundamental metaphysical assumptions, we ﬁnd Newton’s assumptions about
absolute space and absolute time. Another quite important metaphysical assump-
tion is determinism: the assumption that Newton’s laws, together with a set of initial
conditions, determine all bodily motion.
Among the methodological norms, we can name the norm that hypotheses
should be strengthened through systematic experimentation (though Newton prob-
ably had a somewhat different view in this case) and that physics should use
mathematics in order to make numerically precise propositions about the motion
of bodies.
There are many prime exemplars in Principia, such as Newton’s analysis of
lunar motion as a continual free-fall caused by the earth’s gravitation and his
analysis of the motion of the tides as an effect of gravitational forces from the
moon and the sun.
Once a paradigm has been established in a discipline, it functions as a general
conceptual framework. Researchers are more or less unconscious of the framework
and its governing power. The paradigm contains the concepts and assumptions that
researchers take to be so obvious that they never reﬂect upon them or consider their
justiﬁcation. The common reaction to a researcher who questions any part of the
paradigm, by their colleagues, would be to question his or her ability or judgment
rather than questioning the paradigm. This reaction is even more pronounced where
the critic is not a researcher within the paradigm in question. Consequently, and this
is Kuhn’s point, as long as normal scientiﬁc activity is reasonably productive, the
paradigm is never questioned.
Working within a normal science may appear to be a trivial and unimaginative
activity, but such is not the case. Creativity and fantasy play a signiﬁcant role, but
that role is deﬁned by the paradigm.
Sooner or later the researchers of a normal science run into some difﬁculties.
Kuhn claims, quite reasonably, that unsolved problems always exist in all sciences,
but as long as these problems are not too many, or too insistent, then they are not
viewed as grounds for doubting the fundamental assumptions of the paradigm.
However, if the number of unsolved problems–which Kuhn calls anomalies–
become sufﬁciently serious and numerous, researchers in the ﬁeld will begin to
question the fundamental assumptions. One becomes aware of certain aspects of the
paradigm in question, and in light of the accumulation of anomalies, one begins to
question these aspects. The result is that the discipline enters a crisis. This, in turn,
is a precondition for a scientiﬁc revolution and for throwing out one paradigm for
another. The new paradigm may be the conceptual framework for a new period of
normal science.
Kuhn’s most controversial thesis is that different paradigms within a discipline
are incommensurable, or incomparable. Kuhn has two arguments for this thesis.
110

Theories About the Development of Science

The ﬁrst is that different paradigms use different concepts in describing a research
ﬁeld. The meaning of these concepts is decided holistically: each concept’s mean-
ing depends upon its relation to other concepts in the paradigm. This view is called
semantic holism. Semantic holism applies even to the concepts that we use to
describe our observations, which means that all observations are theory-dependent.
This, in turn, means that two propositions claimed within two different paradigms
cannot in general be said to be about the same thing; and therefore, can never be
said to be in conﬂict.
The second argument builds upon the fact that norms are part of paradigms. If
one is to objectively compare two paradigms, then one must have some criteria or
scale against which we measure concurrent paradigms’ relative strengths and
weaknesses. However, using such criteria is to apply methodological norms and
such norms comprise signiﬁcant parts of paradigms. If the methodological norms of
the two paradigms are different, we cannot give an impartial verdict, for it is
obvious that we have (partly) already chosen a paradigm when we choose which
methodological norms are acceptable in comparing the two paradigms. One can
metaphorically describe this situation as there not existing a neutral ground on
which one can stand and impartially compare to concurrent paradigms’ strengths
and weaknesses.
However, if one cannot compare two paradigms, one established and the other
new, then how do we choose between them? Apparently, one cannot make a
rational decision based on a comparison of advantages and disadvantages from a
neutral point of view. Yet, the scientiﬁc community, the active researchers within a
discipline, do make a choice. According to Kuhn, this decision must be based on
external factors such as ‘political correctness’, personal sympathies and antipathies,
the possibility of getting funding, etc. The main point here is, given one’s goal is to
make scientiﬁc progress, there is no rational way to make a choice such that one
optimizes the chances of attaining that goal, if Kuhn’s incommensurability thesis is
correct.
Kuhn’s critics think this is absurd: if science is not the pattern of rational
decision-making, then nothing is. Thus, there must be a rational methodology in
science and Kuhn must be wrong.
Kuhn did not fully accept this consequence that paradigm choice is irrational. He
maintained that his theory did not lead to irrationality. In my opinion however,
maintaining that science is fully rational is nigh on impossible, if one accepts, as
Kuhn does, that two different paradigms are incommensurable.
Fortunately, one can question the strength of the premises on which the incom-
mensurability thesis is built. In my opinion, Kuhn has greatly exaggerated the
extent and implications of semantic holism. For instance, Quine–who accepts a
strong form of semantic holism–has not drawn the conclusion that it is impossible
to compare and choose between theories. As discussed in Chap. 5, Quine thinks that
there are theory-independent statements that, in a certain sense, constitute the
foundation of science. Thus, he maintains that one can objectively compare theories
at this level. Despite this difference, Quine agrees with Kuhn that holism implies
6.4
Normal Science, Scientiﬁc Revolutions and Paradigm Shifts
111

that individual statements, or sentences, in a theory cannot be tested in isolation, but
that one must test and compare entire theories.
Several philosophers, less holistically inclined than Kuhn and Quine, have used
Frege’s distinction between a term’s meaning and reference. Using that distinction
one may accept that a term has changed meaning, while maintaining that its
reference remains, and this enables comparisons between paradigms.
Even the second argument is strongly exaggerated. Many of the paradigm shifts
that Kuhn discusses in his book are not such that the scientiﬁc norms have changed
to any signiﬁcant extent. In most cases, when a scientiﬁc revolution and paradigm
shift occur, the major norms remain unchanged in regards to, for example, the value
of accurate predictions. This is why one often can compare new and old paradigms.
In summary, Kuhn’s arguments for the most controversial thesis in his theory,
the incommensurability of paradigms, are weak and provide insufﬁcient support.
Consequently, there is no basis for claiming that the conclusions drawn during
scientiﬁc revolutions are as irrational as Kuhn’s theory suggests.
Kuhn has in later publications5 developed and modiﬁed his views about scien-
tiﬁc change, incommensurability, paradigms and rationality, but these writings
have been less inﬂuential.
6.5
Lakatos’ Theory of Research Programmes
Imre Lakatos6 succeeded Popper as professor of philosophy of science at the
London School of Economics and was a follower of Popper in regards to his stance
concerning questions about scientiﬁc development.
Lakatos called his theory ‘methodology of scientiﬁc research programmes’
MSRP for short. One can see this theory as an attempt at saving as much as possible
of Popper’s view of science whilst at the same time taking into consideration the
objections raised against it. In some respects, Lakatos was also inﬂuenced by
Kuhn’s ideas on scientiﬁc revolutions, though he did not accept Kuhn’s incommen-
surability thesis. Lakatos – like Kuhn, but unlike Popper – was strongly oriented
towards the actual, historical development of science in developing his
methodology.
Lakatos had two starting points from which he constructed his theory of research
programmes. The ﬁrst is the observation that certain large scientiﬁc breakthroughs
are actually best characterized as veriﬁcations and not falsiﬁcations, as Popper had
claimed. Characteristically, these veriﬁcations are such that two theories are com-
pared using a decisive experiment. Lakatos illustrated his thesis with Eddington’s
observations of the deﬂection of light at the sun’s edge, which was carried out
during the solar eclipse of 1919. During a solar eclipse, one can see the light from
5 Collected in his Kuhn (2000).

112

Theories About the Development of Science

stars that pass near the edge of the sun, on its way to earth. Einstein’s general theory
of relativity predicted that the sun would bend this light as it passed by the sun. The
results of Eddington’s observations agreed with relativity theory and conﬂicted
with classical mechanics. According to Lakatos’ interpretation, it was clear that this
episode veriﬁed relativity theory while at the same time falsifying classical
mechanics.
Lakatos’ second starting point is that one neither can, nor should, evaluate a
single theory in regards to a ﬁxed point in time; rather, all that one can evaluate are
tendencies in the development of a series of theories (i.e. a research programme).
The deciding question is whether the research programme is progressive or degen-
erative. In order to determine which is the case one must adopt a historical
perspective.
According to Lakatos, a research programme consists of a series of related
theories. The common core of such a series is called the hard core. This concept
is quite similar to Kuhn’s concept of symbolic generalizations. Furthermore, there
is a protective belt, which consists of assumptions about measuring instruments,
observation conditions, background assumptions, etc. The purpose of the protective
belt is to provide a buffer between the hard-core and recalcitrant experimental
results; instead of saying that a result shows that the hard core is false, one says that
some assumption in the protective belt is false. This principle is a heuristic
principle, the negative heuristic, which Lakatos formulated as a categorical prohi-
bition; do not use a Modus Tollens argument against the hard core! Finally, there is
also a positive heuristic, which consists of guidelines for the construction of new
theories in the research programme. Thus, a research programme has four
components:
•
The hard core
•
The protective belt
•
The negative heuristic
•
The positive heuristic
Lakatos’ basic methodological rule is the following: give up a degenerative
research programme in favour of a progressive research programme. A degenera-
tive research programme, according to Lakatos, is characterized by theory devel-
opment that occurs primarily in response to empirical difﬁculties; one ﬁnds new
alternatives, exceptions, or reinterprets results in order to explain why the original
theory no longer agrees with the observations. A progressive research programme,
on the other hand, is characterized by theory development that pre-empts experi-
mental results. Theories in the research programme have inherent possibilities for
further development, which able researchers take advantage of prior to experiments
taking place to test these possibilities.
One cannot reasonably say that one should give up a research programme at the
ﬁrst sign of difﬁculty. That would be too rash. Therefore, Lakatos argued that the
methodological rule of throwing out a degenerative research programme should be
supplemented with the regulation that one should give a research programme that
has come into a degenerative phase a certain amount of time to regain its force and
6.5

once again become progressive. This immediately triggers the question, how long
time? Lakatos gave no answer to this question, which leads one to concur with the
following critique, as formulated by Feyerabend: Lakatos has not, in all practical-
ity, given us any methodological rule to follow. Using Lakatos’ rule, every con-
clusion can be defended as rational, which means that he has not succeeded in
distinguishing between rational and irrational methods. Without breaking Lakatos’
rules, one can both claim that it is rational to give up a research programme because
it is degenerative and that one should stick with it because it is in a phase of
temporary difﬁculty. Furthermore, there are well known historical examples that
show that it can take several decades before one is able to overcome temporary
difﬁculties. As a result, Feyerabend characterized Lakatos’ methodology as ‘verbal
ornamentation’.
A response to this critique can be reconstructed from Lakatos’ remarks and
general positions (since Lakatos died in the midst of this debate he did not himself
respond) in the following manner: The theory about research programs is not
primarily intended as a methodological rulebook for on-going research. Instead, it
is to be seen as a methodology for rational reconstruction of the history of science.
When we look back at what has happened in the history of science, it is possible,
according to Lakatos, to describe the development of events as a rational process,
since the conclusions made in practice ﬁt his model. When programmes were
abandoned, it was because they had been in a degenerative phase for some time,
and when programmes were not abandoned, it was because one was trying to
overcome temporary difﬁculties. With hindsight, we can say that large parts of
the history or science are rational processes. However, one cannot expect that
individual researchers would be more rational than other people would.
Researchers – like most people – indulge in wishful thinking, get caught up in
impossible views, and let short-sighted career interests inﬂuence their conclusions,
etc. However, this does not take away from the rational character of their collective
activity.
Lakatos is, in contrast to most in the debate about scientiﬁc development, a
methodological collectivist (see Sect. 9.1) in that he thinks one should explain each
individual’s decisions and beliefs in terms of objectively acting forces. The general
idea of methodological collectivism was ﬁrst proposed by Marx and in his theory
these objectively acting forces are social in nature, (in Marx’ theory they are the
conditions for production) but when talking about scientiﬁc research one can
interpret them as nature exerting a selective pressure on our perceptions, decisions
and ideas. Individual researchers are not more rational than other people, but the
research community is inﬂuenced, as a whole, by objective reality; and hence, the
scientiﬁc community now and then changes research programme. Lakatos’ concept
of rationality should thus be used primarily at the collective level. The critique of
Lakatos that he has not given any solid rules that an individual researcher can
follow in choosing between research programmes misses the point, for this was
never Lakatos’ goal.
Let me stress once more that Lakatos has not explicitly expressed these points
himself; rather, this is an interpretation of his position. It is Ian Hacking in
114
6
Theories About the Development of Science

particular (in his book Representing and Intervening) who has pushed this inter-
pretation. I ﬁnd it plausible since Lakatos, as a former communist, was strongly
inﬂuenced by Hegel and Marx, and both of these thinkers were methodological
collectivists.
6.6
Methodological Anarchism: Anything Goes
Paul Feyerabend7 participated intensely in the debate about the scientiﬁc method
and adhered to essential parts of Kuhn’s view. In particular, he wholly accepted the
incommensurability thesis. Though he went one step further than Kuhn in criticiz-
ing the popular philosophical position that what we know to be science employs a
single identiﬁable method and the success of that method explains scientiﬁc
progress. He has partly a descriptive and partly a normative critique of those, like
Popper, who maintain that there is only one general methodology that qualiﬁes as
scientiﬁc. His ﬁrst point concerns the history of science. Each proposal for a
scientiﬁc method hitherto considered has, in practice, often been neglected or
actively rejected by active researchers, and yet these researchers have managed to
make progress. Feyerabend claims that if researchers were to accept any one of the
philosophers’ proposed methods, it would hinder scientiﬁc progress.
Feyerabend’s way of looking at science is quite similar to the ultraliberal
economist’s view of capitalism and market economy. These economists claim
that the most effective way to promote a rapid increase in wealth is to abolish all,
or most, regulations and let competition in the market take care of itself. The
products and services that best satisfy the customer’s desires will be produced,
and every attempt to direct the market will diminish its effectiveness.
Feyerabend argues that the same goes for research goals and methods. He even
argues that the state should stop favouring activities traditionally called ‘research’.
One should allow all possible traditions of acquiring ‘knowledge’ such as Voodoo,
astrology, crystal therapy, homeopathy and the like, to use a part of societies’
resources for equal competition. This will speed up scientiﬁc development and
increase the chances of dispersion of radically new insights. Finally, Feyerabend
argues that there is no reason to accept the traditional view that knowledge,
understood in the traditional way, leads to a happier life for human beings. In a
truly liberal society, everyone has the right to decide his or her life’s goal. So, what
would the majority prioritize if they could choose? Perhaps they would not want to
promote science? In short, the only methodological rule that Feyerabend accepts is
that there is no binding methodological rule; anything goes.
Some of the Feyerabend’s wording bears traces of the rhetorical ﬁgures and
ideological debate that was prevalent, especially at universities, during the 1960s
and 1970s. For my part, I ﬁnd his analysis of the history of science quite relevant
7 Paul Feyerabend (1924–1998) was born in Austria, but was mostly active in USA.

and pertinent. Without having investigated the issue more systematically, it strikes
me as an accurate observation that science has made progress without consciously
following any methodological rules. It is also clear that no hitherto proposed rules
have been simultaneously generally accepted and practiced; and yet progress has
been, and continues to be made. Furthermore, I think that philosophers should be
extremely careful when prescribing how one should act in order to be a rational,
genuine scientist.
However, if one accepts the view that progress occurs if we let theories and
research projects compete in the ‘market of ideas’, then one needs an explanation of
what is meant by ‘progress’; why one effort result is considered progress, but not
another. Feyerabend, like Kuhn, is faced with difﬁculties regarding the concept of
progress due to his belief in the incommensurability thesis. The reason is that in
order to claim that progress has occurred it does not sufﬁce to say that a new theory
is different from an older one; that the newer theory represent progress presumes
that one has compared the two theories with respect to some criteria that the new
theory better satisﬁes. If a comparison has been made, it means that the theories are
not incommensurable. I would even go so far to claim that it is self-contradictory to
simultaneously hold that progress has occurred when one theory is given over for
another and that those theories (paradigms, or research programmes) are
incommensurable.
Feyerabend’s stance that scientiﬁc knowledge, traditionally understood, does not
lead to happier life for people in general, I strongly dismiss; it strikes me as absurd
to deny that common people in the developed countries live a better life nowadays
than, say 200 years ago, and that this is due mainly to scientiﬁc achievements.
6.7
Summary of the Debate
This chapter gives a short overview of twentieth century currents in the study of
scientiﬁc methodology. The main issue is, and has always been, how we should
characterize scientiﬁc methods in such a way that one can use the characterization
to exclude from science all those activities that do not properly belong to science
(superstitions, religious arguments, pseudoscience, etc.), and include in science all
those activities that do so belong (physics, biology, astronomy, etc.). This formu-
lation suggests that there is a tension between the normative and descriptive goals
of philosophy of science. According to my grasp of the situation, Popper’s biggest
mistake was that he was far too normative and did not sufﬁciently take into
consideration how science is actually performed. This mistake allowed his critics
to question the relevance of his view. Kuhn, on the other hand, made the opposite
mistake. He concentrated far too much on describing the development of science,
which lost him the possibility of saying anything about how science ought to be
carried out in order for it to qualify as science. Philosophical theories about the
development of science must balance both of these aspects in order for them to have
any relevance.
116
6
Theories About the Development of Science

Accordingly, I propose that the starting point should be the hypothetical-
deductive method and the related approach to scientiﬁc theories. A generally held
characteristic of what ‘scientiﬁc’ means could be the following:
To put forth hypotheses, infer testable consequences of those hypotheses, and to be
prepared to reassess one’s hypotheses if the consequences do not agree with observation.
This formulation is quite similar to Popper’s falsiﬁcationism. The difference is
that Popper more precisely claimed that a scientist should abandon a hypothesis if
the consequences conﬂict with observation, whereas I think that such a formulation
is far too categorical. There have been many cases in the history of science where
one has stood by a hypothesis even though it seemed to conﬂict with observation.
This strategy has shown itself to be correct on occasion and has generally been
considered both scientiﬁc and sensible. It is also easy to cite basic arguments for
such a stance. One argument is that veriﬁed observational statements are not
unshakable truths. On any occasion, there could have been something wrong with
the measuring instruments, or there might have been some unknown interference in
connection with the observation. Another way of expressing the same thing is to
point out the possibility that some auxiliary assumptions may have been false.
Therefore, I think that one cannot categorically state that one should abandon a
hypothesis as soon as it comes in conﬂict with observation, but rather one must
make a comprehensive comparison of the probability that something is wrong with
the hypothesis and the probability that something is wrong with the observations,
and then conclude which seems the most reasonable. (Popper later modiﬁed his
view, holding that observational statements, which he called base statements, can
and should be subjected to critical inspection, just like the rest of a theory.)
Adherents of pseudoscience would now be able to claim the following:
There is no clear difference between our methods and your so-called scientiﬁc methods. We
also put forth hypotheses that lead to observable consequences, and you are just as
dogmatic when you stand by your hypotheses in the face of recalcitrant observations as
we are. In practice, the only differences are the principles we believe in. Your attempts to
demarcate what is scientiﬁc (namely, your own methods) are merely a privileged group’s
attempt to hold on to its privileges, its grants and society’s appreciation. In a liberal
democracy one should allow all people to do what they want, as long as it does not hurt
others. Since proponents of so-called scientiﬁc methods have not succeeded in showing that
these methods lead, in the long run, to more secure progress and better results, it is entirely
possible that we would be able to make signiﬁcant progress if only it were allowed that
more ways of looking at reality were given the resources to investigate their inherent
possibilities. (This is essentially Feyerabend’s argument.)
This critique of established science cannot be immediately rejected. Unfortu-
nately, the ﬁrst argument–that scientists have not succeeded in presenting a sufﬁ-
ciently clear criterion for what science is–is true. My approach above is not precise
enough to withstand the critique. The second argument also has a certain air of truth
about it. If one is in academia, one is dependent on access to research grants, and it
is natural that one would try to reduce the competition by claiming that potential
competitors do not fulﬁl the requirements of science.
6.7
Summary of the Debate
117

Nevertheless, I am convinced that there is a sizable difference between science
and pseudoscience. There are certainly difﬁcult borderline cases, but there are also
clear-cut examples on both sides of this line. This difference has to do with the way
a research collective evaluates and revises its beliefs. It can very well be that an
individual researcher breaks with scientiﬁc norms, but this is not reason enough to
reject an entire activity as unscientiﬁc. The relevant level at which to decide this
issue is not at the individual level, but at the collective level. Three reasons for this
are (i) what counts as scientiﬁc results is not what an individual researcher or
research group claim but what those who are familiar with the subject, the
researchers at the forefront of their ﬁeld, accept as a whole, (ii) at the collective
level, the individual researchers’ private opinions regarding politics, ethics, reli-
gion, and their career interests will cancel each other out when it comes to the
collective decision, and (iii) when faced with a conﬂict between hypothesis and
observation, it is not the individual researcher’s judgment that determines which
conclusion will be drawn, but that of the entire research collective. For example, in
the case of a conﬂict between theory and experiment, other researchers repeat the
experiment under different circumstances in order to try to determine if the obser-
vations are at fault, or if the observations are correct and it is the hypothesis that
requires revision.
Hence, I would argue that one could harbour certain expectations regarding the
rationality of science, even though individual researchers are just as irrational as
everyone else. The crucial question is what the institutional organization looks like.
It is required, among other things, that there are multiple independent research
groups working within the same subject area, that these groups have the possibility
of sharing results and that these results are published and subjected to debate and
critique by others within the subject area. In other words, there are reasons to
believe that it is possible to deﬁne a concept of scientiﬁc rationality, even if it is
impossible to give a sharp delineation between science and pseudoscience.
6.8
The Rationality of Science: A Model
William Newton-Smith has proposed a model of scientiﬁc rationality in his book
Rationality of Science. It is intended as an analysis of theoretically interesting cases
where researchers have abandoned an old theory for a new one. This change of
beliefs is, according to Newton-Smith, a rational process if it fulﬁls the following
criteria:
1. The scientiﬁc community has a goal speciﬁed by the model with its scientiﬁc
activity.
2. Between two competing theories T1 and T2, one of them, say T2, is closer to this
goal, given the available evidence.
3. The scientiﬁc community realizes that T2 is closer to the goal than T1.
118
6
Theories About the Development of Science

4. The scientiﬁc community rejects T1 in favour of T2 on the basis of the realization
that T2 is closer to the goal than T1.
This model is nothing but a variation of the model for action explanations given
in Chap. 8, this time applied to collective decisions and collective beliefs; and as I
have previously stated, there is every reason to discuss scientiﬁc rationality at this
level.
I have, however, a minor objection to this model. One cannot say that all
activities that ﬁt into this model are scientiﬁc, because the goals are not speciﬁed.
For example, if one were to plug in for the goal an increase in proﬁtable activity,
this model would apply to sales-oriented companies. (Theories would then become
systems of assumptions about business plans, markets, etc., and the scientiﬁc
community would become upper management.) What is speciﬁc to science is, I
would say, the search for truth. (This is not explicit in Newton-Smith’s view.) Many
would try to fend off such a solemn formulation, preferring formulations such as to
explain what happens, to predict what will happen, to ﬁnd a theory that is empir-
ically adequate (van Fraassen), or to ﬁnd useful theories. In my opinion, all of these
formulations strike me as unsatisfactory on the basis that they do not sufﬁciently
distinguish science from other activities that should not reasonably be called
science.
Point 3 above assumes that T1 and T2 are comparable with respect to how close
they are to the goal. This is a notoriously difﬁcult problem in the philosophy of
science where one takes the goal to be truth. Popper tried to deﬁne closeness to the
truth, verisimilitude, in terms of sets of true and false sentences in the theories in
question. This attempt was a capital failure, and many of Popper’s critics have taken
this to indicate that Popper’s philosophy is bankrupt. Regardless of whether or not
this conclusion is justiﬁed, I believe that no one who wants to discuss scientiﬁc
methods and progress can do so without an ability to judge the relative merits of
competing theories. Of course, one can say, formally, that a theory, which contains
a single false sentence, is false and should be abandoned. Consequently, as it is
likely that all theories we can come up will be marred by some falsities, so all
scientiﬁc theories will prove equally false and so equally worthy of rejection. This
is not a reasonable stance, there are better and worse theories and a bad theory is
better than no theory at all. Ilkka Niinilouto has discussed this issue in depth8 and
has deﬁned a concept of truth-likeness in terms of quantitative differences between
theoretical predictions and observations. This seems to be an intuitively reasonable
way to go.
Finally, point 4 is a clear expression of an internalistic position. If it were the
case that the relevant scientiﬁc community abandoned one theory in favour of
another on the basis of other reasons than that it is closer to the goal
(e.g. political, economic or religious reasons), then we would not say it was a
rational step, even if the decision could afterwards be motivated by a high

probability of fulﬁlling the goal (e.g. acquiring large research grants for active
researchers). This is entirely analogous to how we view an individual person’s
actions. If someone who reads in a horoscope that he/she could have success in
ﬁnancial dealings becomes inspired to buy a lotto ticket and wins millions, we
would still hardly say that this action was rational even if the action, given the
agent’s individual goals, led to a high degree of goal fulﬁlment.

You are always talking about friction. How do you know that it is friction that

P
I do not believe in demons.

I do.
P
Anyway, I do not see how demons can make friction.
F
They just stand in front of things and push to stop them from moving.
P
I cannot see any demons even on the roughest of table.
F
They are too small, also transparent.
P
But there is more friction on rough surfaces.
F
More demons.
P
Oil helps.
F
Oil drowns demons.
P
But if you polish a table there is less friction and balls roll farther.
F
You are wiping the demons off; there are fewer to push.
P
A heavier ball experiences more friction.
F
More demons push it; and it crushes their bones more.
P
If I put a rough brick on the table I can push against friction with more and
more force up to a limit, and the block stays still, with friction just balancing
my push.
F
Of course, the demons push just hard enough to stop you moving the brick; but
there is a limit to their strength beyond which they collapse.
P
But when I push hard enough and get the brick moving, there is a friction that
drags the brick as it moves along.
F
Yes, once they have collapsed the demons are crushed by the brick. It is their
crackling bones that oppose the sliding.
P
I cannot feel them.

Friction follows deﬁnite laws. For example, experiment shows that a brick
sliding along the table is dragged by friction with a force independent of
velocity.
F
Of course, same number of demons to crush, however fast you run over them.
P
If I slide a brick along the table again and again, the same friction is the same
each time. Demons would be crushed in the ﬁrst trip.
F
Yes, but they multiply incredibly fast.
P
There are other laws of frictions: for example, the drag is proportional to the
pressure holding the surfaces together.
F
The Demons live in the pores of surface: more pressure makes more of them
rush out to push and be crushed. Demons act in just the right way to push and
drag with the forces you ﬁnd in your experiments.

Causes Are INUS Conditions
When seeking a scientiﬁc explanation of a given phenomenon, we often look for its
cause. We ask for the reason for why we have caught a cold and why the boiling-
plate becomes hot after having switched on the electricity.
In situations such as these, if we possess a certain level of general knowledge of
scientiﬁc matters we can conclude that a cold is typically caused by a virus and that
the boiling plate becomes hot due to the friction of electrons in the conductive lines
which reside within the metal. But what does it mean for one event to be the cause
of another? A preliminary answer would be that the cause of an event is that which
makes the event take place. But what do we mean by ‘makes’? Is it not more or less
synonymous with the word ‘cause’? Have we really improved our understanding of
causation just by replacing ‘makes’ for ‘causes’? Furthermore, does each event
have a single cause, or are there circumstances in which an event may have more
than one cause?
People often say that a cause necessitates a certain effect. What do we actually
mean by this? It cannot really be a matter of logical necessity, as the relationship
between cause and effect is not purely logical. David Hume (1711–1776) argued
against the idea of a necessary relationship between cause and effect, if this notion
is taken to mean some sort of necessity in the nature. He asked what it is we in fact
observe when we observe that a cause is followed by its effect. According to Hume,
all we can observe is the following: (i) cause precedes effect, (ii) cause and effect
are contiguous, and (iii) there is a constant correlation so that each time we observe
the same type of cause, we can also ﬁnd the same type of effect. Thus there is no
logical connection between cause and effect, nor can we observe any other kind of
necessary connection. Hume therefore concluded that our idea of a necessary
connection between cause and effect is a strictly psychological habit, arising after

having regularly seen a certain type of event followed by another type of event. We
become conditioned to expect that a subsequent event of a certain type will follow
from a prior event of another type, and it is this expectation that creates our belief in
a necessary correlation between cause and effect. Strictly speaking, no cause is, in a
modal or metaphysical sense, necessary. It is just a matter or regularity.
Many people have critically opposed this negative conclusion, yet many others
have also accepted Hume’s view as essentially correct. John Mackie is a modern
philosopher who has further developed the notion of causality in the spirit of David
Hume. In his book The Cement of Universe, Mackie deﬁnes a cause as a so-called
inus-condition. In order to explain what this means, Mackie use a house ﬁre as
example. After such an occurrence, most people, especially the insurance company,
would want to ﬁnd out what caused the ﬁre. The local Fire Department normally
conducts a formal investigation, to determine the cause of the ﬁre, so let us assume
that the investigation concludes that the ﬁre was caused by a short circuit in some
faulty electrical wiring. A spark created at the time of short lit up nearby curtains
and since nobody was home to put out the ﬁre or call the Fire Department, the whole
house was destroyed.
Based on this conclusion we can list several necessary factors that contributed to
this event; the wires were in poor condition, the main circuit breaker for the house
was ‘on’, the curtains were too close to the point in question, nobody was home,
there was oxygen in the room, and so forth. It is evident that if one of these
circumstances had not been present, the house would never have burnt down.
Why did the ﬁre engineer consider the bad wires as the real cause of the event?
Why not the curtains? Why did he not claim that the cause of the ﬁre was that the
main circuit breaker was on, or that there was oxygen in the room? Each of these
conditions is equally necessary for event’s occurrence.
Intuitively, it is clear that in this case we would never say that the presence of
oxygen, or the main power switch, or any of the other circumstances listed above
caused the ﬁre. The reason for this is probably that circumstances that appear
natural and normal do not cause deviations from the normal course of events. It
seems as if our thoughts follow the principle ‘abnormal effects follow abnormal
causes’. However, what is considered abnormal is certainly a function of our
personal perspective and our personal experiences. What may be considered normal
or abnormal in speciﬁc situation is not merely an objective question. The conclu-
sion of this argument is that a ‘cause’ is one of the necessary conditions for a
particular occurrence, but it is impossible to objectively determine which of the
necessary conditions actually caused the event.
Furthermore, the concept ‘necessary conditions’ (see Appendix; necessary con-
dition is not a modal concept!) implies that in order to generate a particular effect,
all necessary conditions must obtain. We can therefore conclude that a cause is a
necessary component of a complex set of conditions, which together bring about a
certain effect.
It is, however, obvious that a house can burn down due to other circumstances
other than a short circuit in the electrical system. Fires can be caused by pyroma-
niacs, lightning, or sparks from nearby ﬁres. Thus the set of conditions, which
126
7
On Causes and Correlations

together caused the house to burn, is one of many possible sets. With this point in
mind, one may offer the following deﬁnition of the concept of a cause:
Def. A cause is a necessary component of a set of conditions, which together are sufﬁcient
for the occurrence of some effect.
This is a somewhat simpliﬁed version of John Mackie’s deﬁnition of a cause,
expressed in terms of the so-called inus conditions:
A cause is an Insufﬁcient but Necessary part of an Unnecessary but Sufﬁcient condition for
the effect.
I explained above that a selection criterion for a given cause is that it must
deviate from what would be considered normal. Another basis for selecting a
particular inus-condition as the cause of a given event is the possibility of manip-
ulation. A third reason to refer to an inus-condition as a cause is that it has a high
degree of speciﬁcity.
There are many medical examples that illustrate this point, such as the cause of
the common cold. It is well known that the cause of the ﬂu, or the common cold, is a
speciﬁc type of virus. However, all who are exposed to the virus do not develop the
illness. For the virus to cause an infection one needs to have a weakened immune
system. So why can we not just say that the ﬂu is caused by a weakened immune
system? Well, that would be reasonable, but we typically point to a virus being the
cause of a common cold or the ﬂu because the virus has a speciﬁc effect. If the
immune system is compromised, several illnesses can take hold, or, if you are
lucky, you may not contract any.
We can easily imagine a somewhat different biological system where the ﬂu
virus is always in the environment and that we normally do not become ill, except
for when the immune system has been compromised. In that case we would
probably say that the cause of the ﬂu is a weakened immune system.
In the medical ﬁeld one often make a distinction between genetic causes and
environmental effects. As the following example1 will show, this distinction is not
that clear.
Some breed of the species Drosophila Melanogaster, the common fruit ﬂy, has a
genetic defect that results in its wings being signiﬁcantly shorter than normal. This
occurs if the temperature is around 20 Celsius at the time the ﬂy is maturing. But if
we change the temperature to about 32 C, we ﬁnd that the wings grow to normal
length. What is the cause of the shortened wings? (Fig. 7.1)
The answer to this depends on which contrast is being considered: if we compare
two populations with the same defective gene pool at different temperatures we
would naturally conclude that it is the low temperature which causes the shortened
wings. However, if we compare two populations of ﬂies at the same temperature, of
which one has shortened wings and another does not, we would say that it is the
genetic factor that caused the shorter wings.
1 The example is taken from Hesslow’s, G. (1984). In Lindahl & Nordenfelt (Eds.), What is a
genetic disease? On the relative importance of causes (pp. 183–93).
7.1
Causes Are INUS Conditions
127

Far from all defects which we typically consider to be genetic can be compen-
sated for by manipulating environmental factors, but the example does demonstrate
that a distinction between genetic and environmental causes is not as clear as one
might have thought.
The general conclusion of this and other examples is the following. The answer
to what is the cause, or what are the causes, of a speciﬁc event has both an objective
and a subjective, or pragmatic, aspect. The objective part of the answer is to give the
necessary conditions of the complex that, as a whole, is sufﬁcient for the effect.

On Causes and Correlations

The pragmatic, subjective or biased part of the answer is the proposal of one of
these conditions as the cause, as opposed the other conditions in the complex,
i.e. the background conditions. This selection is generally governed by our various
interests.
7.2
Cause-Effect and Order in Time
In the discussion above we have looked at examples of both singular occurrences
and connections between classes of events. In the ﬁrst case there are causal
connections between singular events, and in the second case causal connections
obtain between classes of events. Singular events always occur within a speciﬁc
time frame. Cause-effect relation is asymmetrical, that is, if event A causes event B,
it is impossible for B to be the cause of A. The basis for this asymmetry is that cause
must precede effect. In general it is the case that the cause precedes the effect for
every individual cause-effect pair in a class of event pairs (There are cases where
we are prone to say that two events are related as cause and effect albeit they occur
simultaneously, or very nearly so. But this is a limiting case.). The deﬁnition of a
cause as an inus-condition does not include this aspect of causation; rather, it is
taken for granted.
Why does a cause typically precede its effect? The better question is perhaps
‘why have we formed the concept of a cause, which operates in a manner that cause
precedes effect?’ The answer to this question is that causes are typically used to
identify nodes in the ﬂow of events where we can step in and perhaps modify the
course of those events; we want to ﬁnd the cause of an event in order to prevent or
recreate a similar event. Naturally, we cannot prevent an event that has already
taken place. When we want to know the cause of an event, we typically want to
know what to do.
There is thus a pragmatic aspect to selecting the right cause, as we explained in
the previous section. It is worth noting that this view is consistent with the idea that
a cause and an effect could be practically simultaneous.
7.3
Causes and Statistical Correlations
How do we research causal connections? The ideal method would be the follow-
ing: to isolate the object one wants to study and then to vary the presence and
strength of certain factors that may inﬂuence the state of the object, that is, the
different components of the various possible complexes of sufﬁcient conditions.
By varying one factor at a time, and by measuring the variation in the state of the
object, one can obtain quantitative descriptions of how each component inﬂu-
ences the object.
7.3
Causes and Statistical Correlations
129

In most disciplines, however, this is not feasible. Instead, one has to make do
with statistical investigations of classes of objects and events. The type of
information one can acquire from such statistical measurements is essentially
correlations between various factors that answers questions of the form ‘is
there some statistical connection between variables A and B, and how strong is
it’ (See Sect. 4.2).
Before delving further into this discussion, we should note that a correlation can
only be attributed to a pair of sets of events, which we can describe using stochastic
variables, whereas a cause-effect relation basically obtains between two single
events, and only indirectly between types of events.
Despite their name, stochastic variables are actually functions, i.e., mappings
from sets of events to sets of numbers. As an example, consider the throwing of
dice. Suppose we call the stochastic variable K. For each throw of the dice, K
receives a deﬁnite value, the number on the dice. That a stochastic variable receives
a certain deﬁnite value can be considered an event. Thus, when discussing possible
conclusions one can draw from correlations, in regards to causal connections, the
question becomes which causal connections exist between the two individual
events variable X has the value xi and variable Y has the value yi, given these
event types comprise two correlated variables.
Now suppose that there is a strong correlation between two variables A and B.2
Does this mean that A-events cause B-events? No, of course not. For all we know,
B-events could be the cause of A-events, since the statistics give us no way of
knowing the temporal order of the events. There is also a third option, that A-events
and B-events are caused by some unknown type of events, call them C-events,
without there being any causal link between A-events and B-events. If two events
have a common cause, it is likely that they will appear together more often than
could be explained by mere coincidence; and so looking at sequences of the same
type of events, they will be correlated. Hence if all we know is that A and B are
statistically correlated types of events, no stronger conclusion than the following
can be made:
•
A is a cause of B, or
•
B is a cause of A, or
•
A and B have a common cause.
This statement, that every statistical correlation is based on one of these three
types of causal connection, is called Reichenbach’s principle, after the philosopher
Hans Reichenbach (1891–1956).
A common objection to this principle is that the correlation in question might be
purely accidental. This objection is valid only if by ‘correlation’ one refers the
observed correlation of a sample test. Indeed, it is clear that one can ﬁnd a
correlation between two variables in a sample without there being any such
2 Instead of talking about two stochastic variables, statisticians use the notion of a two-dimensional
stochastic variable.
130
7
On Causes and Correlations

correlation in the entire population. As described in Sect. 3.6, it is not possible to
draw any conclusion about the probability for an hypothesis, in this case the
hypothesis that there is a correlation in the population, using only results of
observation of a sample; either one has to start with a prior probability and uses
Bayes’ theorem, or determine the likelihood, i.e., the probability for the observed
result, conditional on the hypothesis that there is a real correlation.
Then, if the probability for obtaining a correlation in the sample test is less than
5 %, conditional on the assumption that there is no correlation in the entire
population, and one still obtains a correlation in the sample test, then one has
obtained a signiﬁcant result at the 5 % level. This result may be interpreted as
showing that there is reason to believe that the hypothesis that there is a correlation
in the entire population. But we haven’t got any probability measure for this
hypothesis.
In what follows, the word ‘correlation’ refers to correlations in reality, that is, in
the entire population and not only in samples. It will be assumed that one has
observed a correlation in a sample test, performed the signiﬁcance test, and
correctly concluded that there really exists a correlation in the entire studied
population. Given this meaning of correlation, the objection above is invalid.
This is clearly shown by the following thought experiment. Suppose we have
chosen 10 objects out an unlimited supply of a certain type of object, and have
subsequently observed two properties. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that there is a correla-
tion between the variables we use for measuring these properties. Of course, this
could be a coincidence. Thus we perform a larger sample test, say of 100 objects,
and ﬁnd the same correlation, or nearly so. Of course, this could also be a
coincidence, even if the probability that it is has diminished. We can continue
this process ad inﬁnitum. If the correlation obtains regardless of how large of a
sample test we perform (which we can never know, but a sequence of larger and
larger samplings showing a convergence to a certain correlation coefﬁcient, may
give strong support for the hypothesis that the real value is close to the convergent
result), then it is, by deﬁnition, not a coincidence that the correlation obtains,
provided the sequence of samples is randomly generated.
In order to determine which of the three alternatives in Reichenbach’s principle
is the case, we must acquire further information. One can often dismiss one of the
alternatives from information about the temporal order: If the singular event B
precedes the singular event A, then A cannot have caused B. But how does one
determine whether A causes B, or if there is a third background factor that is the
cause of both A and B? In some cases the background information is sufﬁcient, as
the following examples illustrate.
Example 1 An investigation conducted in West Germany during the years
1966–1980 showed a correlation between birth rates and the presence of storks;
as the number of storks decreased, so did the number of babies. The correlation was
so strong that the probability for a mere coincidence was calculated to be less than
0.1 %. Hence there are very good reason to believe that it is real correlation. But
since we do not believe that storks deliver babies, or that new-born babies attract
7.3
Causes and Statistical Correlations
131

storks, there must have been a hidden variable, a common cause. In my view, the
most reasonable explanation is that both the decrease in the number of storks and
the decrease in the number of babies are both the effects of an increase in German
urbanization and industrialization during the period of observation (Fig. 7.2).
Example 2 An investigation of a cross-section of a certain population revealed a
correlation between intelligence and shoe size. The bigger the feet, the more likely
it was that one would perform better than the majority on an intelligence test. Is
there in fact a correlation between foot size and the abilities of the brain? No, it is
likelier that some background factor is at work here, namely age. Included in a
cross-section of a population are a number of children of various ages, which have
smaller feet and less likely to score well on an intelligence test than adults. This
explanation can be easily tested by sorting out all children under the age of 18, and

On Causes and Correlations

then checking if the correlation stills obtains. If it does not, then the correlation was
the result of the age factor.
Assume that we do not have any background information that would help us
determine whether a correlation between X-events and Y-events depends on a
causal connection between them, or whether they have a common cause. If an
experiment is feasible, the simplest test is to vary the incidence of X (where X
precedes Y) and observe whether the incidence of Y follows suit. If so, there is an
argument for X being the cause of Y. If the incidence of Y does not vary with the
incidence of X, then X cannot be the cause of Y, which indicates that both X and Y
share a common underlying cause.
However, it is often not practically, or ethically, feasible to perform the required
experiment. In such situations one has no other choice but to calculate various
conditional probabilities and observe which correlations obtain. In order to pre-
cisely say what conclusions can be drawn from information regarding correlations
we need to understand two statistical concepts, viz., statistical independence and
conditional probability.
Def. of Independent events: Two events A and B are independent of one another
if and only if the probability that both A and B occur is the product of the individual
probabilities, i.e. P(A and B) ¼ P(A)P(B).
If this obtains, we say that the probability of the combined event, A and B, is
factorable.
Def. of Conditional Probability:
P A
B


¼ P AB
ð
Þ
P B
ð Þ ;
where P(AB) stands for P(A and B). We express this equation as follows: the
conditional probability of A given B is the probability of A in a population where B
has occurred. The difference between the probabilities P(A) and P A
B


is that they
are calculated in two different populations.
If two events, A and B, are independent of each other, it follows that the
coefﬁcient of correlation rAB ¼ 0 (see Sect. 4.2) i.e. they are not correlated. By
Reichenbach’s Principle, neither A nor B can cause the other. On the other hand, if
A causes B (or B causes A), then a correlation exists which leads to A and B being
dependent, i.e. P(AB) 6¼ P(A)P(B). The converse, however, is not valid. Two events
can be uncorrelated while still being statistically dependent.
(Note the difference between converse and contraposition. Given a proposition
of the form ‘if A, then B’, we can form the converse ‘if B, then A’. However, the
contraposition to ‘if A, then B’ is ‘if not B, then not A’. The contraposition of a
proposition, as opposed to the converse, is a logical consequence of the original
proposition.)
Now suppose that we have a correlation between variables X and Y and we know
that X-events always precede Y-events. At this point we ask ourselves, are the
X-events one of the causes of the Y-events, or do X and Y-events share a common
7.3

cause? Suppose that we believe Z to be this common cause. Using conditional
probabilities we calculate P(XYjZ), P(XjZ) and P(YjZ) and we get either

(In practice, of course, we will never get an exact equality; if P(XYjZ) is close to P
(XjZ) · P(YjZ), we have to make a decision: equal or not?) Assume that P(XYjZ) is
factorable, as in the ﬁrst alternative above. What conclusions can be drawn? One
possibility is that Z actually is a common factor of X-events and Y-events. Another
possibility is that the factor Z stands for an event in between an individual X and
Y-event (Note that even in this case P(XYjZ) is factorable.). If this is case, it
follows that X-events are indirect causes of Y-events, a possibility that cannot be
excluded.
If it so happens that P(XYjZ) is not factorable, as in the second alternative above,
then Z is neither a common cause of X and Y, nor an intermediate factor. This result
does not exclude the possibility of some other common cause of X and Y. All it
means is that we cannot know for sure that X is a cause of Y.
Unfortunately, it seems very difﬁcult draw any deﬁnite conclusions about causal
connections from information about statistical correlations only, even if that infor-
mation is signiﬁcant and we have correctly concluded that these correlation obtain
in the entire population (i.e., we have not made an error of the ﬁrst kind.) More
information is needed. Nancy Cartwright, using arguments different from those
presented here, has come to the same conclusion, formulated as ‘No causes in, no
causes out’ in her (1989).
7.4
Risk Factors and Conditional Probabilities
Risk factors for various diseases are often discussed in medicine. Fore example,
smoking, high cholesterol and a certain genetic disposition are considered to be
factors that increase the risk of a heart attack. This means that the probability of
having a heart attack is increased if any of these factors are present. Thus the
conditional probability of a smoker having a heart attack is higher than the
non-conditional probability. This means that the number of heart attacks in a
group of smokers is higher than in the entire population, which can be expressed as

Rearranging the terms, we get P(HjS) > P(H) · P(S). H and S are evidently statisti-
cally dependent, which implies that there is a correlation between smoking and
heart attacks (In this case there are only two values for each of the two variables,
i.e. smoker/non-smoker and heart attack/no heart attack, which means that the
correlation cannot be calculated in terms of the product–moment presented in
Sect. 4.2; but a different form of correlation can be calculated.). My previous
conclusion, that a correlation should not be automatically interpreted as a causal
connection, also applies to risk factors. A risk factor need not be a cause. Rather, it
could be a side effect of some circumstance, which both causes the disease, and, in
another causal chain, causes the risk factor. In such cases, risk factors function as
warning ﬂags. It follows that if such is the case, there is no point in trying to
decrease or eradicate the risk factor in order to decrease the impact of the disease.
Doing so would be like turning off a warning light in order to avoid the catastrophe
that the light warns us about. It is therefore essential to determine whether or not a
risk factor is a cause (But in this case it is well established that smoking is an inus-
condition, and can thus be said to be a cause, of lung cancer.).
However, it is worth pointing our that one does not often use the term ‘risk
factor’ for factors that we believe not to be causal, even if they correlate with the
disease. Indeed, there seems to be a shift in use of the word ‘risk factor’ from
meaning ‘statistically relevant factor’ to ‘statistically relevant factor, which com-
prises a part of the total cause’. This unclarity is deplorable and Olli Miettinen at
Harvard suggests a remedy:
Determinants of incidence are commonly referred to as risk factors. This term is a
misnomer. Since the relation of an occurrence parameter to a determinant need not be the
result of a causal connection, and since the term ‘factor’ (from the Latin word for doer)
suggests causality, ‘risk factor’ is not a proper substitute for ‘determinant of risk’ A proper
synonym is ‘risk indicator’ – analogously with ‘economic indicator’, ‘health indicator’ and
so on.3

7.5
Direct and Indirect Causes
If A causes B, and B causes C, then A is an indirect cause of C. An indirect cause is
still a cause, according to the above deﬁnition, since if B is a necessary part of a
complex of sufﬁcient conditions for C, and A is a necessary part of sufﬁcient
conditions for B, then A is also a necessary part of sufﬁcient conditions for
C. Thus A is a cause of C. The causal relation is hence transitive, which means
that we can talk about causal chains. Every causal description is, therefore, inﬁnite
in principle. It also means that when we say that some event A causes another
event B, there can, in principle, be inﬁnitely many intermediate events. Thus the
cause of some effect can occur long before that effect. In medicine there are many
such examples, e.g. skin cancer, which can be caused by too much exposure to the
sun decades before the disease arises.
Likewise, historians may discuss distant causes of important historical events.
A. J. P. Taylor argues (in his War by Time-table) that the ‘the man who pulled the
trigger’ and caused the ﬁrst world war (1914–1918) was count Alfred von
Schlieffen, German chief of general staff 1891–1906. How could he have ‘pulled
the trigger’, he retired 8 years before WW1 began?
Schlieffen had construed a mobilisation plan for the German army on the
presumption that France and Russia were allies and if war broke out Russia
would take much longer time to mobilize than France. In case of war, therefore,
the German army should ﬁrst ﬁght France with most of its force and then move to
the eastern front. Hence, according to the plan, immediately after mobilization the
major part of the German army was transported by train to Aachen, near the Belgian
border. There is no place for millions of soldiers in Aachen so every division has,
immediately after debarking the train, to march into Belgium in order to leave place
for new troops coming. And since Belgium was neutral and England and France had
promised to defend it, a German decision to mobilize was also in practice a decision
to invade Belgium, which meant to start war. This was not fully realized by the
Kaiser and his government; the German government’s motive for deciding mobi-
lization in August 1914 was to put political pressure on Russia, not to start war. So
Taylor concludes that Schlieffen’s mobilization plan was the cause of WW1 (And
he shows, quite convincingly, that none of the great powers really wanted war.).
My own view is that Taylor has provided strong reasons to say that von
Schlieffen’s plan is an inus-condition for the ﬁrst world war; and since no one
really wanted war, according to Taylor, it is not unreasonable to say that the
Schlieffen-plan was the cause (The causes of the ﬁrst world war is a hot topic of
debate, and by rehearsing Taylor’s view I do not want to say he is right. But it is a
prima facie plausible account of the causes and an interesting illustration to the
notion of indirect causes.).

On Causes and Correlations

7.6
Causes as Physical Effects
According to David Hume, as we saw in Sect. 7.1, (i) a cause precedes, or at most
occurs simultaneously with, its effect, (ii) causes and effects are always in close
proximity, or connected by an intermediate chain of events also in close proximity,
and (iii) a cause is regularly followed by its effect. One can characterize Hume’s
thesis as that he has given the necessary conditions for the use of the term ‘cause’.
Many philosophers have accepted Hume’s thesis with the modiﬁcation that a cause
makes an effect more probable. But if we accept Reichenbach’s principle, it follows
that Hume’s view cannot be correct, since the third condition, that a cause is
regularly followed by an effect with a certain probability, is not able to distinguish
between true cause-effect relations and common-cause correlations in which one
factor happens to arise sooner than its correlated partner. Those who accept
Reichenbach’s principle thus require a deeper analysis of causation than what we
get from Hume. Thus Reichenbach4 and later Salmon5 have further developed
Hume’s analysis of causation. Since Hume’s second condition of proximity only
applies to physical bodies, we need an analysis of causal connection that does not
view links as made up of such objects.
A natural idea is to deﬁne a causal process as a transmission of energy (Prime
example: the sun transmits energy to the earth and causes life.). That A causes B
simply means that there is a physical connection, a signal of some kind carrying
energy, which is transmitted from A to B. As far we know, there are only four
fundamental kinds of interaction in nature: gravitation, electromagnetism, week
and strong nuclear interaction. If an event A causes another event B, then these
events must be connected by one of these four kinds of interaction, that is, there
must be some exchange of particles doing the signalling from A to B. For example,
in the human body, all connections between cause and effect, such as neural
transmissions, are of an electric nature and neurons exchange charges. Mechanical
interaction, such as friction or pressure, are also at bottom electromagnetic inter-
actions: when two molecules collide with each other they exchange energy and
momentum in the form of electromagnetic quanta, photons.
Since no signal can travel faster than the speed of light, causes must precede
their effects no matter what coordinate system the observer uses. This fact agrees
with our concept of a cause. If a cause and its effect appear to occur simultaneously,
it is actually the case that the time it took for the interaction to take place is so small
that it cannot be measured without sophisticated equipment.
From Mackie’s analysis, it follows that a cause increases the probability that
some effect will ensue. This is because, in most cases, a cause is part of a complex
of necessary conditions, which must all be met for the effect to take place. Thus the

coupling of a cause and an effect is only occasionally strictly deterministic, viz., in
cases where there is only one inus-condition.
7.7
Cause and Effect in History
When studying history one is often interested in causes. For example, one might ask
what caused the fall of the Roman Empire, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, or the
industrial revolution. Can one apply the analysis given above to answer these types
of questions?
The answer is yes. Mackie’s analysis in terms of inus-conditions ﬁts quite well in
these situations, since we usually assume that historical events depend upon a large
number of interacting causes. This analysis tells us that it is incorrect to ask for only
one cause. Rather, we should try to identify all, or most, of the necessary factors,
which together give rise to an historic event.
However, the next step in the analysis of causation, reference to physical
mechanisms, seems, at least at ﬁrst, more problematic. Is it really legitimate to
talk about physical interactions as the basis of causal connections between histor-
ical events? It does not seem reasonable, but such is the case. Historical chains of
events are comprised of a complex net of natural events (climate change, disease,
famine, etc.) and the conscious actions of humans. It is obvious that the natural
events are ultimately connected by physical mechanisms, but what about conscious
actions?
Actions have both an internal side (thoughts, feelings and opinions) and an
external side (our behaviour). Our behaviour, like natural events, is comprised of
physical (chemical and biological) events, which are thus connected to each other
via one of the four fundamental kinds of interaction. But what about our thoughts
and feelings? In fact, even these can be understood as having a physical description
(see Sect. 12.6). According to this view, historical events, including the historical
agent’s conscious considerations and unconscious motives, can be viewed as
connected via causal chains (which are physical in nature) to other events, since
they are at bottom physical states. In any case, there is no conﬂict between the idea
that all causal connections are achieved via one or more of the four fundamental
interactions and the use of the concept of a cause to link historical events.
However, it should be stressed that this fact implies nothing about whether or not
historical events should be described as chains of physical mechanisms. The
argument is not methodological but ontological. In history the physical aspects of
events are not often of much interest. My point is merely to show that it is possible
to give a single uniﬁed analysis of cause and effect that applies equally to the
natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities.

On Causes and Correlations

Counterfactual Accounts of Causation
Causation has been a heated topic of debate among philosophers for decades. One
particularly popular idea is to analyse the causal relation using counterfactual
formulations. The general schema is something like
‘A causes B’ means ‘if A had not occurred, B would not have occurred’.
This appears intuitively plausible, but I’m inclined to respond that I understand
the meaning of the word ‘cause’ much better than the meaning of counterfactual
propositions. So those who argue that counterfactual analyses of causation need a
viable account of the semantics of counterfactuals. Many have relied upon the
notion of possible worlds, utilized in the semantics of necessity and possibility.
Roughly, the idea is as follows: in our world A occurs and is followed by B,
whereas in a possible world, fulﬁlling certain conditions, A does not occur and
neither does B. The crucial problem is, of course, how to identify those possible
worlds where neither A nor B occur without using intuitions about causation, which
in my view seems difﬁcult. In fact, much of the discussion has been about purported
counterexamples built upon our intuitions about causation. In other words, our
intuitions about causation are used as adequacy conditions for a counterfactual
analysis. But, why, then bother about counterfactuals, if we have stronger semantic
intuitions about the concept of cause than that of counterfactuals? If anything, it
seems more reasonable to analyse counterfactuals in term of causes.
An alternative account of counterfactuals builds on Judea Pearl’s notion of
structural equations, see Pearl (2000). The structural equations in a model of a
type of system describe the dynamical evolution of the system being modelled.
There is a structural equation for each variable of the form
Y ¼ f X1, . . . Xn
ð
Þ
where X1, . . . Xn are the variables in the model. This equation is read by
e.g. Woodward (2003) and Hitchcock (2001) as
If the variable X1 would have the value x1, X2 the value x2. . ..., then Y would have the value
f(x1,. . ..xn)
How do we obtain knowledge about such equations? By doing experiments and
observations and generalise from limited number of observations to these general
statements. In other words, causation is in this approach related to our possibilities
to manipulate systems. In this I wholly agree, most often are we interested in causes
because we want to know what to do in a particular situation.
Repeated manipulations of a system thus may enable us to formulate structural
equations that express observed regularities. This is thoroughly discussed in Pearl’s
(2000). What this means, basically, is that this is a version of Hume’s regularity
account of causation, with the amendment that it is observed regularities which are
brought about by manipulations.

Summary
The discussion of the concept of cause, as it is practically used, has led to the
concept of inus-conditions. In cases where we want to pinpoint some such factor as
the central or most important cause, this selection was shown to be a pragmatic one.
We even found that the way we use the concept of a cause requires that the cause
precede its effect and that both must be in close proximity, or otherwise connected
by intermediate causes.
Cause-effect relations give rise to statistical correlations. What we observe are
correlations, but if two events are correlated we cannot validly infer that they are
causally related, because two events that share a common cause are also correlated.
An important task in many scientiﬁc disciplines is to determine which of the three
possible causal connections, listed by Reichenbach, accounts for a particular
observed correlation. In fact, this can only occasionally be done using only statis-
tical methods. Thus if at all feasible, performing the right experiment is a signiﬁ-
cantly more effective approach.
Finally, we placed the concept of a cause in our scientiﬁc world-view by
conceiving of the connection between cause and effect as physical in nature
i.e. based on one of the four fundamental kinds of interaction found in nature.
Exercises
1. In the 1940s, a strong correlation was found between the consumption of sweets
and the frequency of caries among children. Could we conclude from this that a
similar investigation would yield a similar result today?
2. So far, all attempts to establish a statistical correlation between so-called ‘oral
galvanism’ (a taste of metal in the mouth, pain, headaches etc.) and the presence
of other galvanic currents in the mouth have been unsuccessful. Does this mean
that we can exclude galvanic currents as the cause of oral galvanism?
3. The following information is known:
(a)
Large amounts of substance X is a risk factor for the disease Y.
(b)
Lowering the amount of X in a group of people with high values of X in
their bodies, but who have not yet contracted Y, does not reduce the risk for
Y in this group.
What conclusion(s) can one draw from these observations?
4. Suppose that a positive correlation has been found between low levels of a
substance F in the blood and the incidence of the disease S. Which conclusion or
conclusions can one draw from this?
(a)
Low levels of F is a risk factor for S.
(b)
Treating a group of patients with a medicine that increase the level of F in
the blood will reduce the incidence of S.
(c)
Either the lack of F contributes to S, or S contributes to the lack of F.
(d)
There is a hidden factor causing both the low levels of F and the incidence
of S, though the level of F in the blood has no effect on the incidence of S.

None of the above conclusions can be drawn from the given information.
5. Given that the presence of factor F in the blood exceeding a certain limit causes
disease G, which of the following is true?
(a)
If no amount of F is present in the blood, then one will not contract G.
(b)
If the amount of F in the blood exceeds the limit, one will contract
disease G.
(c)
If the amount of F in the blood exceeds the limit, then the risk of contracting
G is increased.
(d)
If one has G, then the amount of F present in the blood must have exceeded
the limit.

If the amount of F exceeds the limit, the risk of contracting G will decrease
if a medicine is administered to lower the amount of F in the blood.
6. The following example is ﬁctitious. Out of a population of Swedish students,
31 % decide to seek higher education. Among students who have parents with
academic training, 70 % seek higher education. Does this higher probability for
higher education depend upon cultural factors, or does it depend on the fact that
more educated parents have higher incomes? In order to answer this question,
the following investigation was undertaken. The families whose income was
50 % higher than average were sorted out. Out of this group of families, 58 % of
students went on to higher education. Furthermore, from this high-income
group, 72 % of the students who chose to go on to higher education had
academically trained parents. The families that contained at least one academ-
ically trained parent made up 80 % of the high-income group.
What does this statistical data show? Is it higher education or higher income
that causes a child from an academically trained family to seek higher education
more often than other children?
7. Suppose you want to know whether there is a causal connection between two
variables X and Y in a population. You select a sample from the population,
measure the two variables and ﬁnd no correlation. It is of course possible that
there is a correlation in the population, so you make a statistical test. It shows
that it is highly unlikely that there is a correlation in the population and you
conclude there is not. Suppose this is true. Could one then infer that there is no
causal connection between X and Y? Hint: Google ‘Simpson’s paradox’.

Explanations
‘After the professor’s explanation we were just as confused
as before, only now on a higher level.’
8.1
Explanation and Prediction
The goal of science is a much-debated issue within philosophy of science. Is the
goal of science to produce scientiﬁc explanations, or is it to make predictions?
Some people attribute an essentially psychological meaning to the word ‘explana-
tion’; and hence infer that explanations are not important for the sciences. Instead, it
is claimed that what is essential to science is accurate prediction. On the other hand,
some say that the central aim of science is to satisfy our curiosity in regards to how
the world works; to understand physical processes, social processes, man’s history
and people’s reasons for their actions, which is acquired through explanation. Thus
explanation is essential to science, whereas predictions only have to do with the
application of science in technology. Technology is important, of course, but it is
by-product of our understanding of how the world works.
A different view of this matter, held by Hempel, among others, is that the only
difference between explanation and prediction is the temporal order of the act of
explanation or prediction and the relevant event itself. Thus explanations regard
past events, whereas predictions are about future events, but the relation between
the explanans (that which explains/predicts) and the explanandum (that which is to
be explained/predicted) is the same. Therefore, according to this view there is no
interesting difference between explanation and prediction. It follows that if one can
predict future events, then one can thereby also give a good explanation of those
events once they have occurred.
I don’t think Hempel’s view holds water. There are many examples where one
can make good predictions, but those predictions are not considered good expla-
nations of a certain phenomenon. One can also give examples of the reverse:
situations where good explanations can be given, and yet no relevant predictions
can be made on the basis of those explanations. As an example of the ﬁrst case,
consider the correlation between the motion of the moon and ocean tides. Many
people have observed this correlation over millennia; particularly in England,

where tidal ranges are large and important for navigation at sea ports. High tide
follows only a few hours after the moon travels past the meridian. Given that one
has been able to rather accurately calculate the moon’s motion ever since the time
of the Babylonians, it has long been possible to predict the tides with reasonable
accuracy. However, there was no explanation for this correlation until Newton
published his theory of gravity. The fact is that Newton’s ability to explain the
change in tides was considered a monumental step forward for science, even though
one had previously been able to accurately predict high and low tides.
An example of the second case, that one can give a good scientiﬁc explanation of
some phenomenon without the possibility of making a prediction, is found within
biology. Many biological phenomena can be explained with the help of the two
basic principles of evolution,1 but these principles cannot be used to predict
anything. For example, consider the long neck of the giraffe. It is not difﬁcult to
explain why giraffes have such long necks given that (i) they live in the savannah,
and (ii) gene variation occurs randomly. The giraffes that, due to random genetic
variation, happened to have longer necks than other giraffes could eat leaves higher
up in the trees and hence were better ﬁt to reproduce. After a number of generations,
the entire population came to have long necks. However, from this mechanism one
cannot derive any prediction of which traits giraffes will acquire in the future, since
the mutation of giraffe genes occurs at random and the disadvantages of a very long
neck may come to outweigh the advantages at some point in the future via habitat
change or some other mechanism.
In what follows, I will take for granted that explanations are different from
predictions, even though predictions are sometimes facilitated by scientiﬁc
explanation.
8.2
What Is Explained?
In everyday situations the word ‘explanation’ is used in many different contexts. In
university education, as in other formal educations, new concepts are introduced
and explained. This can be done in different ways, such as by giving explicit
deﬁnitions, or by giving examples that show how a certain concept is used.
However, this is not the meaning of explanation as it is discussed in the philosophy
of science. Rather, what we are interested in is scientiﬁc explanation.
A scientiﬁc explanation can be roughly characterized as a line of reasoning that
satisﬁes our curiosity about a phenomenon. In fact, much research is driven by the
researcher’s desire to understand mysterious phenomena. According to this view,
which I share, explanation is the goal of all scientiﬁc disciplines. The question that
1 These principles are the following: (i) individuals of the same species struggle for survival and
the chance to reproduce, and those best adapted to their environment produce more offspring, and
(ii) genetic variation in a species occurs randomly.
144

Explanations

then arises is whether explanations have the same form in every scientiﬁc
discipline.
According to a well-known position formulated by Dilthey and Weber, among
others, there is an essential difference between explanation in the natural sciences
and explanation in the humanities/social sciences (German Kulturwissenschaften).
According to Dilthey and Weber, explanations in the natural sciences aim at
producing descriptions of causal mechanisms, whereas in the cultural sciences,
explanations aim to give understanding. The concept of understanding, as it is used
here, contains an element of empathy (German Einf€uhlung). The objects of such
explanation are actions and the artefacts and institutions those actions produce;
these actions and artefacts have an intentional component that require interpreta-
tion, and are therefore not suitable for causal explanation.
Contrary to Dilthey’s and Weber’s views, Carl Hempel2 claimed that all expla-
nation, regardless of domain, has a common structure. This thesis has been much
debated.
Another overarching issue regarding explanation is whether it is possible to
determine the correctness or force of an explanation independent of the context in
which it is provided. Many philosophers take it for granted, almost unconsciously,
that the explanatory force of a scientiﬁc theory is a context-independent property
that can be determined objectively once we ﬁnd the correct general structure of
explanation. In contrast to this view, a few philosophers, most notably Bas van
Fraassen, have claimed that explanatory force is not something that a theory
contains per se. According to this view, explanations are fundamentally dependent
on their context; they are answers to questions people ask.
I will start by discussing the most well known model of explanation, the
so-called Deductive-Nomological model (D-N model), developed by Hempel and
Oppenheim, which claim universal applicability. Then I shall take up its statistical
counterpart, the Inductive-Statistical model of explanation, which will be followed
by a number of modiﬁcations of the D-N model. Following this discussion, I will
present models for explanation that do not claim universal applicability, ending
ﬁnally with a discussion of Bas van Fraassen’s pragmatic model of explanation.
This list does not exhaust all the various models of explanation. The debate
surrounding this issue is quite lively, and as a result many ideas have been
discussed. This shows that the concept of scientiﬁc explanation is multifaceted.
The discussion will continue in the next chapter with various aspects of explanation
that are especially relevant to the humanities and social sciences.
In the forthcoming discussion, two technical concepts will be important: ‘that
which explains’, or explanans and ‘that is which is explained’, or explanandum.
2 Carl Hempel (1905–1998) was born in Germany and worked in USA.

8.3
The D-N Model
The modern philosophical debate about explanation began with Hempel and
Oppenheim’s seminal 1948 paper Studies in the Logic of Explanation, in which
they present the Deductive-Nomological model of explanation. The central idea of
this model is that an explanation is a deductive inference from one or more scientiﬁc
laws (law ¼ Greek nomos) and initial conditions.
A classic example is Newton’s explanation of why all bodies fall with the same
acceleration, regardless of how heavy there are. According to an intuitive under-
standing of falling objects, it seems that the heavier an object is, the faster it falls,
which was the general belief up until Galilei disproved it at the beginning of the
seventeenth century.
Newton’s explanation builds upon two fundamental laws; the law of gravity and
Newton’s second law, which states that a force (F) exerted on a body is equal to the
body’s mass (m) multiplied by its acceleration (a), i.e. F ¼ ma. The law of gravity
states that two bodies attract each other with a force proportional to the product of
their masses and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
them, as is given by the formula
F ¼ G m1m2
r2
;
where G is the universal gravitational constant, which Newton calculated to be
6.67*1011 Nm2/kg2 by experimenting with pendulums. If we treat falling as the
result of the gravitational force between the falling object and the earth, we can
equate the force due to gravity and the force causing acceleration, which gives us
m1a ¼ G m1m2
r2
;
where m1 is the mass of the falling body, m2 is the mass of Earth, and r is the
distance between the centres of the two bodies. This equation can be reduced to
a ¼ Gm2
r2 :
Thus the acceleration of a body is determined by the universal gravitational
constant, the earth’s mass, and the distance between the falling object and the
earth. Newton showed that the distance between two bodies, in this kind of
situation, is the distance between their centres, and thus that we can use the earth’s
radius and a measure of r. The earth’s mass is 6.0*1024 kg and its radius is
6.4*106 m. Plugging these values into the formula above gives us the acceleration,
namely 9.8 m/s2. Thus we have a mathematical, i.e. logically valid, inference to the
conclusion that free fall acceleration is constant and independent of the mass of the
falling body.
146
8
Explanations

Such an argument is, according to Hempel, a good scientiﬁc explanation of why
free fall acceleration is constant for all bodies. The two essential elements of this
explanation are (i) that the argument is a logically valid inference to the
explanandum, and (ii) that the explanans contains at least one scientiﬁc law.
Hempel presents these two properties as necessary and sufﬁcient formal criteria
for explanation. The only other requirement is that the propositions contained in a
given explanation are true.
Schematically, we can organize the explanation of free fall acceleration in the
following way:
Law 1:
F ¼ G m1m2
r2
Law 2:
F ¼ ma
Initial Conditions:
Earth’s mass ¼ m2 ¼ 6.0*1024 kg
Radius of Earth ¼ r ¼ 6.4*106 m
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Conclusion:
a ¼ 9.8 m/s2
Hempel argued that all explanations must fulﬁl these two formal criteria, and
conversely that all arguments that fulﬁl these criteria, and whose premises are true,
are explanations. Thus he claimed that all explanations, if they are truly explana-
tions, have this structure, regardless of whether they pertain to physics, biology,
history or any other science. Before we examine whether these criteria are actually
valid in sciences like history, let us discuss whether this model is correct within its
primary domain of application, the natural sciences.
It is easy to ﬁnd lots of examples of arguments within the natural sciences that
we immediately understand to be good explanations, and that have the aforemen-
tioned structure, but it is just as easy to ﬁnd counterexamples.
8.3.1
Problems with the D-N Model
(i) An explanation requires access to scientiﬁc laws. How have we come to know
such laws? Well, quite often we have guessed or inferred them from the
phenomena they are meant to explain. For example, one argument for believing
the law of gravitation is the observed behaviour of bodies in free fall. But for an
argument to count as an explanation, it is reasonable to expect acceptance of
the explanans to be independent of the explanandum. If the explanans is to
explain the explanandum, then our reasons for deeming the explanans to be
true cannot involve the explanandum. Hempel’s model thus requires that
before the explanation is presented, we somehow have knowledge of the
scientiﬁc laws involved and accept them as true. As we shall see in the next
chapter, this is a big problem.
(ii) Explanations are asymmetric even as regards the laws. This asymmetry is
missing in the D-N model. Consider the following explanation:
8.3
The D-N Model
147

Law: If stormy weather is coming, the barometer falls.3
Initial Condition: Stormy weather is coming.
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Explanandum: The barometer falls.
This seems to be ok. If someone asks why the barometer fell, one would give an
explanation very similar to the above example. The argument is intuitively accept-
able and fulﬁls the two criteria for explanation, but compare it to the following:
Law: If the barometer falls, then stormy weather is coming.
Observation: The barometer fell.
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Conclusion: Stormy weather is coming.
This example also fulﬁls the requirements of the D-N model (for argument’s
sake, let’s assume that the law ‘If the barometer falls, then stormy weather is
coming’ is at least approximately correct), but one cannot very well accept it as a
correct scientiﬁc explanation for why stormy weather ensues. That the barometer
falls does not explain why there is stormy weather; rather, the opposite is the case:
the stormy weather explains why the barometer fell. There is asymmetry between
explanans and explanandum; that is, if A is part of the explanation for B, then B
cannot be part of the explanation for A.
If we generalize the above example, we see that the requirement of asymmetry
entails that the laws used in D-N explanations must also be asymmetric, in the sense
that the reasons for believing ‘If A, then B’ are not good reasons for believing ‘If B,
then A’. This in turn shows that a correlation cannot sufﬁce as a premise/law in an
explanation. For if there is a strict correlation between A and B, then we can express
it in the canonical form ‘A if and only if B’. If this is true (in the case of partial
correlations we can replace/generalise the expression ‘If A, then B’ with ‘The
probability of B, given A’ and vice versa), then we do not have asymmetry. This
shows the correlations lack explanatory force.
Furthermore, not all sentences of the form ‘if A, then B’ for which there is
empirical support are accepted as laws. What is more needed than empirical
support? This question is discussed in Chap. 10.
(iii) The D-N model allows for the explanation of a single fact from a general
statement. This is normally not considered a real explanation. Here is one
example:
Law: All ravens are black.
Initial Condition: The observed object is a raven.
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Conclusion: The observed object is black.
3 It is doubtful whether we really should call this a law, because (i) it is a qualitative statement, and
(ii) there are exceptions. But Hempel and Oppenheim didn’t mention any strictures of what to
count as a law and their own example is similar in these respects. And the problem here under
scrutiny doesn’t depend on these aspects.
148
8
Explanations

One can hardly accept this argument as an explanation for why the observed
raven is black, since in such a case it is not the singular observation that requires
explanation, but rather the fact that all ravens are black; we would normally not
classify the observed object as a raven if it were not black. If someone were to
observe a white raven, we would all want an explanation for why it is white and not
black like all the rest, but in the case of observing another black raven, one would
probably want to know why all ravens are black, and not just why the observed
raven happens to be black.
This problem arises because of the assumption, held by proponents of the D-N
model that it is primarily singular events we want explained. This is often not the
case. We often require scientiﬁc explanations of repeatable phenomena, and not of
unique events. (Of course, the opposite can be the case in regards to human action,
but we shall discuss this later.) Thus the D-N model does not place sufﬁcient
requirements on what can be accepted as an explanation.
At least two ways of improving this model have been proposed. The ﬁrst is to
restrict the types of laws allowed in explanations to only causal laws. One would
then be able to say that the D-N model is a model for causal explanations, which is
what Hempel and Oppenheim probably thought, even though they made no dis-
tinction between causal laws and non-causal regularities. The other proposal is
called ‘uniﬁcation’. The idea is that a phenomenon can be explained if one can
show that it is logically associated with other previously unrelated phenomena.
8.4
Causal Explanations
One way to improve the D-N model is to restrict the type of laws required for
explanations to only causal laws. With this requirement, one could say that the
barometer example does not refute the model, since ‘if the barometer falls, then
stormy weather is coming’ is not a causal law, and thus the barometer example is
not an explanation. On the other hand, it is reasonable to claim that stormy weather
causes the barometer to fall, that is, if one includes low air pressure in the concept
‘stormy weather’.
We have already discussed the issue of how one distinguishes between causal
laws and other laws in the previous chapter. We saw that all laws that relate
variables to each other, whether they are deterministic or probabilistic, are corre-
lations, and we have identiﬁed the conditions that must be satisﬁed for there being a
causal connection between two variables. Alas, we are often unable to determine
whether these requirements are fulﬁlled, but the point is that there is a distinction.
Returning to the barometer example above, with the help of meteorological knowl-
edge we can determine that the connection between stormy weather and a low
barometer value is a correlation caused by a common factor; namely, low air
pressure.
8.4
Causal Explanations
149

As we will see in Chap. 10, scientiﬁc laws have the logical form ‘For all x, if Ax,
then Bx’. Thus a precondition for a causal explanation is that ‘Ax’ describes a cause
of the event Bx. (See the Appendix for a discussion of the logical form.)
In summary, one can say that a causal explanation is a logical inference from the
cause to the effect based on a causal law.
8.5
Explanation as Uniﬁcation
Another modiﬁcation that has been proposed to improve the D-N model is uniﬁca-
tion. The central idea is that, though an explanandum is logically inferred from the
explanans in agreement with the D-N model, the explanatory force of an argument
does not primarily lie in this particular inference, but in the fact that many disparate
phenomena can be similarly explained. This union is accomplished when the
explanans not only explains a particular explanandum, but also others simulta-
neously. In other words, a proposed scientiﬁc law that only explains one type of
empirical phenomena does not have much explanatory force. To illustrate this idea,
once again consider Newton’s law of gravitation. If it could be used only to infer
free fall acceleration, it would not be much of an explanation of such phenomena.
For a ponderous person could ask, ‘what reasons do you have for believing in the
law of gravitation?’ The answer would then be that the law of gravitation explains
the constant acceleration during free fall, which makes the reasoning circular.
However, we know that the law of gravitation can be used to explain a great
many seemingly unrelated phenomena for example:
•
Kepler’s three laws for planetary motion,
•
The motion of pendulums,
•
The tides,
•
The orbits of comets,
•
The earth’s ﬂattening at the poles,
•
The precession of the vernal equinox
This means that our reasons for believing the law of gravitation are not limited to
the particular phenomenon we want to explain in the ﬁrst place, but that there are
other independent empirical observations that serve as evidence for the law of
gravitation. It is this property of the law of gravitation that gives it its explanatory
force; the law of gravitation uniﬁes the description of a number of phenomena into a
coherent theory. An added advantage of this model is that it apparently contains
different degrees of explanatory force, because it seems natural to talk about
degrees of uniﬁcation.
This view of explanation avoids the three previously mentioned problems with
the D-N model: (1) we get an explanation of how we come to believe the explan-
atory law, (2) uniﬁcation is asymmetric and (3) trivial generalizations have no
explanatory force. However, it is not easy to formulate this idea into a concrete
model. In this author’s estimation the most natural model is that presented by

Michael Friedman.4 Unfortunately, this model has been shown to have serious
problems. Another variation, put forth by Philip Kitcher,5 has attracted more
interest. However, a deeper discussion of these theories’ strengths and weaknesses
falls outside of the scope of this book.

Statistical Explanations
Statistical explanations are explanations that contain probabilistic arguments.
Hempel argued that there is a strong analogy between deductive-nomological and
so-called inductive-statistical explanation. The difference is – according to Hempel
– that instead of deterministic laws in the explanans, there are statistical laws. It
follows that the explanandum cannot, in a strict sense, logically follow from the
explanans. Rather, it follows with a certain probability.
Statistical laws have the form ‘Event Y occurs with probability p, given that
event X has occurred’, which in mathematical notation becomes P(Y|X) ¼ p. Thus
the structure of explanation is schematically
P Y
X


¼ p
X has occurred
-----------------------p
Y occurs:
The statement that Y occurs is not a logical consequence of the premises, which is
indicated by the dotted line.
The word ‘event’ should be understood in the mathematical-statistical sense: an
object having a property is an event. According to Hempel, a statistical explanation
is good if the probability p is close to 1. The model is called ‘inductive’ because we
cannot logically deduce that Y will occur, even if X has occurred. But we do have
statistical evidence to rely on, which can be formulated into statistical laws.
One central problem, which Hempel himself noticed and discussed, is that the
probability of an event occurring seems to depend upon how we describe that event.
An example is the following: Olga Svensson, 56, works as a public servant in
Sweden. What is the probability that she will vote for the social democrats at the
next election?
Given that a large number of middle aged women working in the public service
sector in Sweden vote for social democrats, one might guess the probability to be
rather high; say 60 %. If we now suppose that Olga is a doctor, and that it is widely
known that doctors’ political preference is more conservative, then this probability
must be revised to a lower value. If we further suppose that Olga is a professor at a

medical institute, then one must further lower the probability that she will vote for
social democrats, since this portion of doctors tend to be even more conservative.
Finally, if we point out that she is a member of the social democratic party, then the
probability changes radically in the opposite direction. So what is the actual
probability that Olga votes for the social democrats?
This example illustrates the so-called reference class problem: the probability of
some event depends on which reference class one thinks the event belongs to. The
probability that Olga votes social democrat depends on how you describe her; that
is, to which reference class she belongs. If we describe Olga as a member of the
social democratic party, then we get a high probability, and therefore an explana-
tion of why she voted social democrat. But if we describe her as a professor at a
medical institute, we get a high probability that she will not vote social democrat,
and thus an explanation of the complement event. This is not acceptable. One
cannot reasonably say that one both has an explanation of some event and an
explanation of the ‘opposite’ event.
Hempel proposed that one could solve this problem by requiring maximal
speciﬁcity for the event to be explained. Maximal speciﬁcity is related to available
knowledge. In the case above, the event X would be a complete description of all of
Olga’s known properties.
The problem with this solution is that the resulting inductive-statistical expla-
nation is relative to what we know. Hence explanatory force cannot be an objective
property of the theory. This conﬂicts with the fundamental assumption, which many
philosophers – including Hempel – made early on, that scientiﬁc explanations must
be objective and independent of the knowledge of observers. Given that explana-
tory force is not objective, Hempel was forced to give up the connection between
explanatory force and truth.
It might be possible to avoid the relativism of explanation due to available
knowledge by stating that maximal speciﬁcity includes descriptions of all proper-
ties that effect the probability of an event’s occurrence, known or otherwise.
Assume then that we have described a certain event completely; that is, all
circumstances that inﬂuence the probability of an event’s occurrence are taken
into account. Is it not then likely that we will ﬁnd that the probability of this event’s
occurrence is either zero or one, since we have all the relevant information
necessary to make that determination? If so, then we no longer have a statistical
explanation, but a deductive-nomological one. We thus may infer that there are no
such things as objective inductive statistical explanations. Conversely, we should
accept that where these explanations are employed, as they often are in the sciences,
that the probabilities used in these explanations do not reﬂect objective, observer-
independent facts.
The only way to sidestep this conclusion is to say that inductive-statistical
explanations are only applicable to genuinely random events. A genuinely random
event is such that even if we know everything there is to know about the conditions
152
8
Explanations

for an event’s occurrence, we still cannot predict what will happen with certainty.
I’ll return to this topic in a moment.
Another problem is that, in many cases, we accept a probabilistic argument as a
good explanation for events that are believed to be not genuinely random even
though the event in question’s probability is quite low. The connection between
lung cancer and smoking is good example. Suppose a person has contracted lung
cancer and that we ask for an explanation. We then view the information that the
cancer victim smoked more than one pack of cigarettes per day for over 30 years as
a good explanation. But, in fact, the probability of getting lung cancer if you smoke
for over 30 years is only about 6 %. Still, we say that smoking is a good explanation
for lung cancer. Therefore, Hempel’s requirement that the probability should be
high cannot be generally reasonable. Rather, it seems that the increase in proba-
bility when given new information is the essential explanatory step. The probability
that a person will get lung cancer is very, very low, but if we add the information
that a person has smoked for over 30 years, the probability increases many times
over from this low baseline. It is this relative increase that we see as explanatory.
This view suggests that what we take to be a good explanation depends upon what
we know before the event, as well as what we ﬁnd out from the explanation.
Furthermore, this example and the entire discussion about inductive-statistical
explanations also suggests that explanations have a contextual component that
cannot be neglected. I will return to this point in Sect. 8.8.
I mentioned earlier that one could avoid the reference class problem in cases
where the explanandum is a genuinely random event.6 It is easy to see that this is the
case. Suppose we describe an event in a certain way and give the probability of its
occurrence. Suppose further that all relevant circumstances are contained in this
description. This means that the addition of any other information will not change
the probability. Thus the probability of the event’s occurrence is independent of any
further speciﬁcations, and a complete description of the event, if it were possible to
give one, would also not change the probability. But then this probability must be
the result of a genuinely random event, and is not due to incomplete knowledge of
relevant circumstances.
Of course, one can never be certain that a probability is the result of genuine
randomness. However, according to our best present theories about nature, there
are some genuine random events; namely, irreversible state changes in quantum
mechanics. The most well known example is the radioactive decay of atomic
nuclei. In such cases one can, using quantum theory, determine the probability
that an atom’s nucleus will decay within a certain time interval. Furthermore,
there is no additional knowledge that could change this probability. If quantum
mechanics is a correct and complete theory, then we have a case of maximal
6 It is not easy to exactly describe what is meant by a genuinely random event. Even most random
events, e.g. computer generation of random numbers, can be shown to be determined by some
complicated rule. One deﬁnition, due to Chaitin, is to say that a sequence is random if it is not
possible to formulate an algorithm that produces the sequence and such that the algorithm is
shorter than the sequence itself.

speciﬁcity, and the relevant probabilities that can be calculated using this theory
are objective. Moreover, the explanatory force does not depend on the probability
given.7
The conclusion seems to be that in situations where we cite a statistical argument
as the explanation of some determined event without possessing all relevant infor-
mation about the event, then one cannot give a strictly objective interpretation of the
statistical explanation. That is to say, the explanation has an unavoidable contextual
component, just as in the case of Olga’s vote. Explanatory force is thus associated
with what one knows prior to receiving the explanation, as well as any other
information given when the explanans is presented. But in a case where the statistical
law is an expression of genuine randomness and not a measure of our ignorance, one
can give an objective and non-contextual analysis of the explanation.
8.7
Action Explanations
Human actions must be treated as a speciﬁc category when talking about explana-
tions. This is because actions are intentional phenomena by nature. To explain an
action is to view a human as an agent, whose actions can be judged in terms of what
is rational or irrational. There are certainly exceptions to this rule, such as when one
explains the actions of a psychotic person in terms of disturbances in the mecha-
nisms of the brain. Yet we resort to this sort of causal-mechanical explanations only
when the usual rational explanations, given in terms of beliefs and desires, fail.
We explain actions by giving the agent’s reasons, i.e., citing the relevant motives
or goals associated with those actions; this is more or less common sense. If we are
unable to give an explanation in terms of motives, and instead attempt to give a
biological explanation, we treat the action as behaviour. The difference is that when
we describe something as behaviour instead of describing it as an action, we omit
intentional components that we include, explicitly or implicitly, when we describe
something as an action. Put another way, one can say that the concepts of action and
explanation in terms of motives are logically connected.
We explain an action by citing its purpose or motive, as well as the agent’s
beliefs, which function as the link between the action and that action’s goal. This
means that the explanans contains two intentional elements: goals and beliefs. Thus
explanations in terms of motives have the following form:
Agent A wants to achieve goal G
Agent A believes the best way to achieve G is to perform action H
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Agent A performs action H
7 Peter Railton has observed that the reference class problem can be avoided in cases where
probabilities are interpreted as propensities, see Railton (1978). And since transition probabilities
in quantum mechanics can be calculated without knowledge about frequencies, they can be viewed
as propensities.
154
8
Explanations

There is no guarantee that A in fact performs H, even if she wants to achieve her
goal and believes that the best way to reach that goal is by performing H. For
example, she could lack the necessary will, or have other goals that conﬂict with
action H. Therefore, this explanation is not a logical inference of the explanandum
from the explanans.
Suppose that we observe action H, or rather its behavioural component. In order
to explain this action, we must ﬁrst interpret it as a conscious action by ascribing an
intention to perform the act to the agent concerned. We must then ﬁnd out what
beliefs and goals the agent has. However, this is not sufﬁcient. For the explanation
to be complete we must know that the action was performed for just these reasons
and no others. It is not uncommon that the true reasons for an action differ from
those explicitly stated, or from those that seem the most reasonable. Thus explana-
tion inevitably contains elements of interpretation as regards the agent’s actions and
statements.
Notice also that the explanans contains an element of direction towards the
future, toward the agent’s desired state. Thus some have concluded that that which
explains an action lies in the future. However, this view confuses the content of a
desire with the mental act of having that desire. The act of having a desire occurs
before, or perhaps simultaneously with, the action in question, though the content of
this desire is identiﬁed by a description of a possible future state of affairs. That
which explains an action is the fact that an agent has a certain motive, and this
mental state occurs prior to the action. That the content of a motive is directed
toward the future doesn’t imply that the motive itself is held in the future. So the
common argument that action explanations cannot be a species of causal explana-
tions since causes precede their effects and that action explanations are future-
oriented, is not valid: having a goal and a belief could cause an action though their
content be about future states of affairs.
But there is another reason for not holding action explanations to be causal
explanations: causal explanations require causal laws, and there seem to be no strict
laws in the mental realm, only rough regularities, such as ‘if one is successful in a
difﬁcult endeavour, then one becomes satisﬁed.’
Davidson has in his (1963) defended the common sense view that reasons, i.e.,
desires and beliefs, explains actions and that it is a species of causal explanation,
without reliance of laws. Several philosophers have argued that Davidson is wrong
on this point, holding that reasons, i.e., desires and beliefs, are not causes of actions.
There has been an intense debate about this issue but no clear conclusion has
generally been accepted.
In Chap. 1 I claimed that action explanations are, presumably, the original model
for explanations of all phenomena. Natural phenomena were explained by the will
of gods, spirits, or other conscious beings in a prime example of overgeneralization.
It was a huge step forward when people realized that explanations in terms of
motivations were not applicable beyond human actions.

8.8
Pragmatic Explanations
All the theories of explanation hitherto considered take for granted that the explana-
tory relation is only a relation between explanans and explanandum and that it is
possible to determine whether an argument is an explanation without considering the
context of the act being explained. Peter Achinstein has formulated this idea in the
following way: when we have been convinced that the statements which make up the
explanans are true, we should be able to determine, a priori, whether or not the
purported explanation really is an explanation.8 And Achinstein has argued – con-
vincingly in my view – that for all the well-known models of explanation there are
examples where this condition is not met. This indicates that the context of explanation
has greater import than normally assumed. This is the basic idea in Bas van Fraassen’s
account of explanation, which is presented in his book The Scientiﬁc Image.
Van Fraassen claims that the question as to whether an explanation is correct can
be answered only when it is given in the following form: is the given explanation
good, or correct, in this context? The contextual component is made up of what the
questioner knows or believes prior to looking for an explanation. According to van
Fraassen, an explanation is an answer to a why-question. Thus the theory of
explanations is a part of the theory of questions and answers.
Van Fraassen views the following as a typical explanatory situation:
Question
Why P?
Answer
P is the case, as opposed to Q, R, S, . . ., because A.
P is called the topic, which is the state of affairs about which the questioner is
inquiring. Furthermore, the questioner assumes a set of possible, although not
actualized, alternative states {Q, R, S, . . .}, which together with P are called the
contrast class. In many cases these alternatives may be implicit. The why-question
is thus formulated with the implicit assumption that P is the only actual state of
affairs. Hence the ﬁrst condition for answering the question ‘why P?’ is thus that ‘P’
is true and that all other alternatives in the contrast class are false. Suppose someone
were to ask you ‘why is the sky green?’ You could not reasonably explain why the
sky is green, and thus the only rational answer would be to reject the implicit claim
that the sky is green. The second condition is that the answer, A, must also be true,
and the third is that the answer must be relevant to the question. In other words,
there must exist a relevance relation between the question and the answer. What
this condition amounts to is not clearly expressed by van Fraassen. Two critics,
Kitcher and Salmon, have shown that if one does not place any requirements on the
relevance relation, one can construct a relevance relation such that any arbitrary
true statement can answer any arbitrary question!9 Kitcher and Salmon drew the
conclusion that one must impose certain requirements on the relevance relation.

Explanations

However, there is a question as to whether these critics have correctly under-
stood van Fraassen’s intention with his pragmatic model of explanation. Van
Fraassen has not replied on this critique, but a defence is easily come by. A
consequence of his pragmatic view of explanation is that the relevance relation
between question and answer is a pragmatic aspect of the situation; that is, the
answer must be deemed relevant by the questioner in a given situation. This means
that one cannot say, in general, that a certain answer is relevant or irrelevant to a
given question, but only that an answer can be relevant to some person in a certain
situation while being irrelevant to another person in a different situation. There are
therefore no criteria by which we can determine, independent of context, whether or
not a proposed explanation is good. This means that it is not possible to place any
universally applicable or context-independent requirements on the relevance rela-
tion. The question as to whether some explanation is good or not is incomplete.
What is meaningful to ask is whether a certain explanation, in a given situation, is
acceptable for a particular person. (The only non-contextual requirement on an
explanation is that the statements that make up the explanans are true.) According
to van Fraassen, there is no such thing as the correct explanation. This also implies
that a theory’s explanatory force is not something that can be used as evidence for
the truth or believability of a theory. Explanations are thus uninteresting as regards
epistemology, according to van Fraassen, which leads him to reject explanatory
force as a relevant factor in comparing two competing theories.
The conclusion is that if van Fraassen is correct, explanations are irrelevant to
scientiﬁc epistemology; and consequently, we should not devote time and effort to
discuss them. According to van Fraassen, the central question in science and the
philosophy of science is, ‘which theories agree with the empirical data?’ Whether a
theory has strong or weak explanatory force is a question about what the scientiﬁc
community considers to be reasonable or obvious. These aspects are not relevant to
the question about whether scientiﬁc theories agree with empirical data.
Van Fraassen claims that this pragmatic theory solves two important problems
affecting most theories of explanation. The ﬁrst problem is that not all requests for
explanation are reasonable. The solution to this problem is easily found in van
Fraassen’s theory, since a condition for it to be meaningful to answer the question
‘why P?’, and so reasonable to pose the question in the ﬁrst instance, is that P must
be true.
The other advantage of the pragmatic theory is, according to van Fraassen, that it
accounts for the asymmetry of explanation. If A is a relevant answer to the question
‘Why P?’, then P is not normally a relevant answer to ‘why A?’
Arguably, van Fraassen’s pragmatic theory is quite successful as regards expla-
nations in ordinary contexts. However, is it not reasonable to say that, in certain
scientiﬁc situations, the contextual component is either minimal or non-existent? In
other words, in a situation where a scientiﬁc explanation is requested, one expects
an objective, context-independent, and generally acceptable explanation with
respect to all relevant scientiﬁc theories. For example, one could claim that the
explanation of some physical phenomenon should provide the objective physical
causes of the phenomenon in question. Van Fraassen could perhaps reply here that
8.8
Pragmatic Explanations
157

the discussion of causation in the previous chapter showed precisely that the choice
of a cause for some event is context-dependent, and that the only context-
independent proposition one can make is in regard to what factors make up
necessary conditions. In response, one could say that all language use is context-
dependent, and thus this is nothing unique to explanation. Furthermore, all of these
obvious necessary conditions show up in a given explanation as so-called Ceteris
Paribus clauses, which will be discussed in Chap. 10.
8.9
Summary
The word ‘explanation’ is used in many different ways in various situations. All
together, ‘scientiﬁc explanation’ concerns the explanation of phenomena, and not
the explanation of the content of different concepts.
There are two fundamental conﬂicts in the debate over explanation. The ﬁrst is
whether there is a general model that applies to all kinds of scientiﬁc explanation.
According to Hempel, the D-N model is such a model, which he takes to be
generally applicable to all sciences. In response to his critics, who argue that this
model does not ﬁt historical explanations, Hempel states that those explanations
found in history are not complete; they are merely sketches of explanations, which
lack many details. Once these details are ﬁlled in, the explanation should fulﬁl the
requirements of the D-N model. The counterargument to this response is the
following: if we are to construct a model for scientiﬁc explanation, we must ﬁrst
know the actual nature of explanations in each discipline. We cannot simply try to
ﬁt explanations into a pre-established model.
The second fundamental dispute concerns whether the concept of scientiﬁc
explanation contains a contextual component. Hempel, and many of his critics,
have taken for granted that the concept of scientiﬁc explanation is a non-contextual
concept, whereas Achinstein and van Fraassen have claimed that the contextual
component is essential. The consequence of this latter view is that explanatory force
of a theory cannot be used as an evaluative parameter, since it is relative to the
background knowledge of those receiving the explanation. Contrary to this view,
one could argue that there is a certain basic perspective shared by all active
scientists in a given discipline, which is sufﬁcient for the discussion of a theory’s
explanatory force independently of context, within that discipline. In van Fraassen’s
terminology, the relevance relation is decided by the theoretical perspective of the
active researchers in a given discipline.
Exercises
Below are a number of examples of explanations, some of which are very sketchy.
Discuss which model best ﬁts each explanation.
1. Between 1850 and 1920, over one million Swedes immigrated to USA. Why?
Historians claim that there were essentially two types of factors that explain this
immigration. The ﬁrst type is the push-factors, such as overpopulation, poverty,
158
8
Explanations

the state church’s oppression of ‘free-church’ movements, etc. The second type
was the pull-factors; cultivation of the prairie gave many people the possibility
of earning a decent living, leading early immigrants to write home about their
success. Once emigration from Sweden was under way, the door was open for
those who had family member or friends already settled in the U.S. to travel west
and join them.
2. For more than 40 years, Pripps (a Swedish brewing company) had been licensed
to produce Coca Cola in Sweden. In 1997, Coca Cola voided Pripps’ contract
and decided to build their own factory to serve the Scandinavian market. Why
did Coca Cola cancel the contract? An explanation given by the press is that
Coca Cola was unhappy with its market share in Sweden, since they had a
smaller portion of the soft drink market in Sweden than in other comparable
countries. This is because Pripps, who dominated the soft drink market at the
time, competed with Coca Cola in regards to some similar products. Thus Pripps
was not interested in increasing Coca Cola’s market share, as this would result in
lower sales of Pripps’ products.
3. Why did a bloody war in Bosnia follow the fall of Yugoslavia? A not too
unreasonable sketch of an explanation is the following. At the fall of commu-
nism, Slobodan Milosovic, who was then party chief of the Republic of Serbia,
saw where change was headed and that he was in risk of losing power. He chose
to appeal to Serbian-nationalist sentiments in order to acquire a new political
platform. Milosovic was successful, and the result was that many people
dreamed of a Greater Serbia as the successor of Yugoslavia. Since the Serbians
practically had control over the Yugoslavian army, their leader chose to start a
civil war with the knowledge that they had superior military resources on their
side. The goal was to create a cohesive area in Bosnia devoid of Muslims and
then join with the remainder of Yugoslavia, thereby building themselves a dream
state for all Serbians.
4. Why are carrots orange? Answer: The colour of carrots comes from carotene
molecules. All molecules contain electrons that are situated at difference energy
levels. In a carotene molecule, the difference in energy between the highest level
and the next highest level is about 3 eV. When light hits a carrot, the light ray is
absorbed with a frequency that corresponds to the energy gap, according to the
formula E ¼ hf, where h is Planck’s constant and f is the frequency. Blue light
has just the right frequency corresponding to the energy gap so that it is
absorbed. Thus when we look at a carrot, it looks orange, since the colour
complement to the absorbed colour dominates the reﬂected light.

Methodological Collectivism Versus Methodological
Individualism
There are two possible perspectives one can adopt when discussing social phenomena.
One can either discuss phenomena with respect to some speciﬁc point in time, or else
discuss phenomena in terms of historical development. The former adopts what is
known as a synchronic perspective, while the latter adopts what is known as a
diachronic perspective. In either case, one is confronted with a basic methodological
choice: should one explain states of affairs, institutions, events, etc., in terms of the
agent’s motives, beliefs, desires and actions, or should one reverse the explanatory
direction by looking instead at objective social forces in order to explain agents’
actions and thoughts? The ﬁrst alternative is called methodological individualism, and
the latter methodological collectivism. If one opts for the ﬁrst alternative one naturally
starts using some version of the action explanation model, while if one prefers the
latter alternative, some sort of causal explanation will be the most relevant.
From a methodological point of view, both alternatives have their pros and cons.
A disadvantage of methodological individualism is that agents are sometimes
inaccessible (agents of historical events are in most cases dead) and thus
unavailable for questioning, leaving us with only the historical artefacts and sources
they have left behind. These artefacts are often incomplete and difﬁcult to interpret.
Furthermore, one is often suspicious that the explicitly recorded motives of an
action are ﬁctitious, or outright lies. In politics, as in everyday life, few people are
completely honest about their beliefs, motives and desires. Another drawback is
that one sometimes gets the feeling that the individual agent’s motives and beliefs
are partly a product of the society in which they live. Therefore, an agent’s
individual characteristics may not be all that interesting or relevant. For, as regards
a historically interesting event, it is possible that the characteristics of the agents
involved did not play a large role. Perhaps they simply happened to be at the right

place at the right time to ﬁll in the necessary roles for some event’s occurrence (or –
as it may seem in some cases – the wrong place at the wrong time). The suspicion
that agent’s motives and beliefs are products of the society they live in is the basic
intuition in methodological collectivism.
If we instead adopt methodological collectivism, another difﬁculty arises. Sup-
pose we want to explain a speciﬁc event or the existence of a certain trait in society
with the help of social forces, which operate more or less independently of the
individual agents involved. Naturally, one would then give a causal explanation. If
such an explanation is to be successful, one needs to discover the general causal
laws connecting various features of society. This has proved an extremely difﬁcult
task. The difﬁculty lies in precisely stating the conditions under which a type of
social phenomenon will occur. In principle, one could accept that there exist
historical and social laws that manifest themselves only once, but how could we
know anything about such a law? Furthermore, in order to have a successful
explanation, according to methodological collectivism, we need causal laws that
connect social phenomena with the thoughts and beliefs of the various agents in a
society: one needs causal laws of the type, ‘under objective circumstances X,
people tend to desire (believe, think) Y’. Once again, this has proven difﬁcult, if
not impossible. To answer this concern one might opt for an account of singular
causation (‘event A caused even B’) where laws play no role, but then there is a
problem in regards to what is meant by a ‘cause’ in such a context.
Generally, one is a methodological individualist or collectivist on the basis of
ones view of human nature. Methodological collectivists tend to view humans as
social creatures by nature, whose character traits, beliefs and desires are shaped by
interacting with other people. One exponent of the collectivist view was Aristotle
who wrote: ‘Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial
naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human.’1
Another is Marx who claimed that man’s consciousness is determined by his
relations to others. There is certainly some truth in these statements, but a really
explanatory theory about the relations between individual minds and the surround-
ing social structure is lacking. The problem is conceptual; the term ‘social structure’
covers phenomena that somehow are constituted by individual minds, so one need
to think of the relation between individual minds and society as internal: the relata
are constituted by the relation and so cannot be described and identiﬁed without
reference to the relation.
Methodological collectivists can criticise the other camp for only going half-way
when using individual beliefs and perspectives as explanans for social phenomena;
Such an explanation does not exhibit the more basic elements of history and society,
but only the manifestation of social forces in the minds of individuals. The
methodological individualist may reply that human beings are autonomous agents
whose beliefs, thoughts, motives and desires cannot be fully reduced to external
social factors.

Explanation in the Humanities and Social Sciences

Hence, explanations in social and human sciences differ profoundly from expla-
nations in the natural sciences.
Many philosophers, for example Popper, have claimed that the only reasonable
stance is methodological individualism, since the existence of impersonal forces
not based on the thoughts and actions of individual people is pure mysticism. In my
opinion, this argument does not sufﬁciently take into account the essential social
nature of human beings. There is a known case where a girl has been kept alive in
the cellar by her father but not really being interacted with or spoken to for several
formative years. When she was found, she got the best possible care and linguistic
training, but she never became a ﬂuent speaker and she was mentally retarded. This
is but one drastic example, but the general conclusion is supported by a wealth of
evidence. Maturing into a person with a mind requires intense social interaction.
It is obvious that more than one person is required in order to create languages
and norms. Methodological individualists do not deny this, but they do claim that
social forces are the results of individual actions. Thus this discussion appears
similar to the question as to what came ﬁrst, the chicken or the egg.
According to the methodological collectivist, history should be cleansed of
descriptions of individual actions, because such events are determined by external,
impersonal forces. An explanation that consists of a description of a chain of events
containing some individual actions is thus considered insufﬁciently penetrating. An
illustrative example is the Marxist view on the creation and development of the
capitalist system. Marx claimed that a historical explanation of economic develop-
ment misses the point if it draws upon individual desires and actions, (Why is the
nobility so rich? They are greedy!) since these things arise in social situations.
Rather, it is the development of productive forces – the technical and organizational
development of material production – that determines the economic-historical
process. The methodological individualist replies that every such technical or
organizational change is the result of individual decisions guided by the individ-
ual’s desire to better his or her own life.
We can, perhaps, see here the contours of a solution to the methodological
collectivist’s problem of describing social forces in a way that does not involve
the conscious actions of agents. The basic regularities that govern human action can
perhaps be described in biological terms, such as the basic desire to live, reproduce,
and improve one’s living conditions. These are regularities among humans that can
be explained without resorting to mysticism.
It is not unreasonable to say that the choice between methodological collectiv-
ism/individualism is really just a choice of the starting point for an explanation.
Every explanation consists in presenting certain statements, an explanans, as an
explanation for some explanandum. An inquisitive person might accept the overall
explanation and yet request an explanation for some of the circumstances expressed
in the explanans. Just like causal chains, explanation chains progress, and regress,
indeﬁnitely. In other words, there is no phenomenon such that it does not require an
explanation. From this perspective, one could say that the methodological individ-
ualist ﬁnds it reasonable to make the beliefs and desires of individual agents the
ultimate starting point of an explanation, whereas the collectivist is more interested
9.1
Methodological Collectivism Versus Methodological Individualism
163

in the social forces that brought those beliefs and desires into being. The choice
between methodological collectivism and individualism is thus a choice concerning
which questions one ﬁnds most interesting and which facts one ﬁnds so obvious that
they do not require explanation. This conclusion points towards a pragmatic view of
explanation like the one discussed at the end of the previous chapter. In short, the
choice between methodological collectivism and individualism depends upon the
type of question one wants answered.
9.2
Explanations of Historical Events
In the case of historical events, it is difﬁcult to claim that similar events occur: every
historical event is more or less unique. It is therefore doubtful that there are any
historical laws similar to those used in describing natural phenomena. In historical
explanations, individual events make up both the explanans and explanandum. So
then, what kind of relations must obtain between two historical events such that the
ﬁrst event explains the second event?
Every historical event depends on the interaction of a great number of factors.
Thus according to many historians, the most reasonable model for historical
explanation is narration. To explain an historical event is to describe a number of
these factors such that the explanandum appears natural as the next step in the story.
This view seems reasonably intuitive and appears to coincide with how most
historical explanations are presented. The links of the chain of events that build
up the story are of different kinds. Some are the actions of individual agents, some
social processes and others are natural phenomena. Adherents to the narrative
model of explanation are often methodological individualists, although most
would accept that the individual agent’s feelings, motives and beliefs are inﬂuenced
by the circumstances in which the agent lives. However, narration, i.e., story telling,
leaves many things unaddressed. Historical narration is often allowed to omit those
beliefs and thoughts that we commonly consider obvious or natural. As regards
western medieval history, for example, one need not explain why agents tended to
have strongly religious world-views. But one would require an explanation for why
certain individuals were extremely pious or notably irreligious.
The philosopher Paul Ricoeur, who forcefully argued for narration as the model
for historical explanation, has claimed that Hempel was right in insisting that if a
description of a chain of events is to have any explanatory force, the connection
between two events must not be a literally unique case. For, if we are to understand
the former event as explaining the latter event, we must see these events as
instances of types of events that regularly follow each other. That is to say, there
must be, at least implicitly, a law-like connection between two events in order for
explanation to be possible. The narration must be presented such that the
explanandum follows rationally and naturally in the given circumstances, which
means that one must describe the circumstances such that one grasps the generality
of the situation.
164

Explanation in the Humanities and Social Sciences

Narration can have either an individualistic or collective character. If a chain of a
narrative contains a description of the origin of some agent’s desires or beliefs
(e.g. strong nationalistic sentiments), then the methodological collectivist can
explain this chain in terms of social forces. This seems reasonable as long as the
beliefs or desires in question are not agent-speciﬁc. However, if the agent
(s) involved have peculiar or unique beliefs or desires, then perhaps what we
want to know is how this peculiarity came about, which would require a more
individualistic perspective.
All narration is selective. We choose a number of aspects out of a multifaceted
reality and include these in our story, while other aspects are left out. This selection
is governed by what one believes about the audience’s perspective, as is always the
case in situations of communication. Thus we have yet another case for the
pragmatic character of explanation.
The following example illustrates a number of the points made above. It is an
article written by leading economist Jeffery Sachs and published in the Swedish
newspaper Dagens Nyheter on March 23, 1998.
What caused the Asian crisis during the fall 1997?
There are those who blame Asian capitalism for the Asian crisis: a devastating mixture
of corruption, nepotism, governmental interference and bad ﬁnancial control. This expla-
nation suits western banks just ﬁne, as it relieves them of all responsibility. But if Asian
capitalism is so bad, then why did those banks invest so much money in Asia to begin with?
A more plausible explanation is that the investors panicked. Perhaps they were too
euphoric in 1996, and already too pessimistic the year after. In the end, the result was a
devastating panic that hurt both investors and the Asian economy.
The immediate cause was clearly a sudden change in the ﬂow of capital. In 1996,
foreign investors placed 93 billion dollars into Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and
Thailand. In 1997, they withdrew 7 billion dollars. This swing of 105 billion dollars
corresponds to 11 per cent of the national income of these countries and has driven them
into a deep recession.’
The structure of this explanation, or rather suggested explanation, is the follow-
ing. The Asian crisis is explained as being caused by negative capital ﬂow. A causal
law is thus being implicitly applied here; namely, ‘[i]f a country’s capital ﬂow
changes rapidly in a negative direction, then this country will experience an
economic crisis’. This ‘law’ is not very precisely formulated, and is perhaps not
as deterministic as is suggested above, but it is obvious that Sachs uses such a law in
his argument. It is also clear that Sachs takes this law to be well known and
generally accepted, since he does not bother to argue for it separately.
The triggering factor in this case is a sharp decline in the ﬂow of capital. But why
was there such a drastic change in ﬂow in 1997? The reason is, according to Sachs,
that the investors panicked. This part of the outline is thus an explanation of an
action. To panic is to enter into a certain mental state. In this case, the investors
believed they were loosing money in Asia and that the best way to avoid this loss
was to pull out of the Asian market as fast as possible. Obviously, the investors’
goal was to earn money and avoid any losses.
In summary, we have here a short narrative consisting mainly of two coupled
explanations. The ﬁrst, the explanation of the change in the ﬂow of capital, is an
9.2
Explanations of Historical Events
165

action explanation. The second, an explanation of the effect of this change in capital
ﬂow, is a causal explanation. However, neither explanation is complete. The story
only contains the elements the author believes to be necessary in order for the
reader to follow his argument, nothing more. The pragmatic element that shows
itself here is the choice of factors that are to be included, and those that are omitted,
in the explanation.
9.3
Explanation of Social Phenomena
Explanations of social phenomena, especially social institutions, are controversial
in two respects. One is the conﬂict between methodological individualism and
methodological collectivism, and the other concerns what kinds of concepts should
be used. The latter dispute is most clearly seen within psychology and psychiatry
where one either treats humans as agents, in which case action explanations are
appropriate, or one treats humans as organisms that exhibit certain behaviour, in
which case the appropriate explanation will be the one that explains that behaviour.
Recall that action and behaviour are different things. When we describe something
as behaviour, we do not assume that it is accompanied by any conscious mental
processes, (or it may be tacitly assumed that it is, but treated as irrelevant) whereas
when describing an action, we do.
Are there any unconscious actions? Yes. For instance, an actor can honestly deny
having a particular belief without anyone taking his words at face value; few
nowadays deny that our minds contain unconscious elements.
One can generalize this conceptual observation to all of the social sciences.
Many, perhaps most, of the relevant concepts in the social sciences have an
intentional component that refers to conscious or unconscious attitudes or beliefs.
Consider, for example, the concept buying something. This concept is connected to
a host of juridical and economic institutions, such as contracts, money, and prop-
erty. If I buy something, then I own it and I have the right to use it. Furthermore, I
am obligated to pay for this object. If someone stole the object from me, I would
have the right to ask for the help of certain authorities to get it back. Most often we
do not consciously entertain these beliefs, but we are aware of these social facts. All
these concepts describe social relations between people based on collective inten-
tions that exist among the members of the society in which the object was
purchased.
An event that clearly illustrates the intentional character of these juridical/
economic relations is the Dutch colonists’ purchase of Manhattan from the Native
American community, the Lenape Indians, who used the island as hunting ground.
According to the colonists, they bought the land from the Native Americans for
60 guilders. However, the Lenape Indians did not think of the interaction that way.
On the home page http://delawaretribe.org/blog/2013/06/26/faqs/#Living their
descendants write: ‘Our ancestors were asked to sign treaties giving up the land,
but they had no idea that they were actually selling land any more than you would
166
9
Explanation in the Humanities and Social Sciences

think someone could sell air. The belief was that all land was put here by the Creator
for use by his children, and that you should not be stingy with it.’
One might guess that the Lenape people viewed the transaction as an act of
diplomacy, through which the colonists were expressing their peaceful intentions
by giving them gifts. Hence, whether we should classify the handing over of
60 guilders from the colonists to the Lenape people as a purchase or as a gift
depends on whose perspective we speak from. If we ask ‘but was this transaction
really a purchase or a gift’, we are erroneously assuming that one can use these
concepts without referring to the beliefs of the people involved.
These two controversies, methodological collectivism/individualism and causal/
intentional explanations, are intimately connected without being identical. An
adherent to methodological collectivism tends to neglect intentional components
of actions, whereas the methodological individualist stresses them.
Thus the question is whether the correct model of explanation in the social
sciences is some form of causal explanation, or some version of action explanation.
The answer depends, to a great extent, upon how one perceives human beings. If
one views humans as primarily autonomous individuals, it is natural to adopt
methodological individualism. If, on the other hand, one views humans as primarily
social creatures, which have few or no properties (except biological ones) indepen-
dent of their society, then it is natural to adopt methodological collectivism.
Any given view of human beings is a mixture of factual and ideological
convictions. Although it may in principle be possible to formulate the question
about methodological collectivism/individualism as a question about what is the
most scientiﬁcally interesting way to study social phenomena, ideological aspects
cannot in practice be disregarded.
One might think it obvious that a sociologist would be a methodological
collectivist, since in this discipline one is mostly interested in collective phenomena
and not the speciﬁc properties or actions of individuals. However, the question of
methodological collectivism versus individualism is a question about what explains
what. Can one explain social phenomena via a description of the involved individ-
uals’ properties, or are the properties of individuals explained by the social envi-
ronment in which they live?
No matter which type of explanation is correct, one might think that, since many
relevant concepts in the social sciences have an intentional component, the only
reasonable model is that of action explanation. However, the matter is not that
simple. First, the intentional aspect of social concepts is a collective intentionality,
and not an individual one. Since the goal of many sociological inquiries is to
investigate the genesis, structure, and development of social institutions involving
such intentional components, one cannot take collective intentions as primitive
elements of explanations, as it is precisely these one wants explained. Secondly,
one can claim – as many have done – that intentions (individual as well as
collective) are a type of causes. It is therefore reasonable to use causal models
even in the social sciences.
In my view, collective intentionality is a central concept in the social sciences.
Furthermore, it is a theoretical concept, as one cannot observe collective intentions.
9.3
Explanation of Social Phenomena
167

A difﬁcult problem is the relation between collective and individual intentions.
The simplest view, which states that collective intentions are nothing but the sum of
individual intentions among the members of a group of people, is clearly inade-
quate, since individual intentions are heavily inﬂuenced by experiences of belong-
ing to different groups.
Besides these two alternatives (causal and action explanations), there is a third
alternative known as functional explanation.
9.4
Functional Explanations
If we turn our attention towards scientiﬁc practice, it seems we quite often ﬁnd that
there is a special type of explanation in the social sciences; namely, functional
explanation. An explanation is called functional if it explains a social phenomenon
in terms of an important, though often unintended, function that phenomenon
performs in a society. If a habit or trait that is not inherited serves no function,
then it is not reproduced, and soon disappears. That is to say, there must be a
feedback mechanism that helps some habit or trait be reproduced from time to time.
Thus in some sense, the existence of a phenomenon is explained by its positive
function.
An example that is often discussed in illustrating this point is taken from Robert
Merton. Merton studied a number of American companies and discovered a signif-
icant difference in conﬂict level between successful and less successful companies.
The more successful companies had higher conﬂict levels. Merton interpreted this
fact as the result of the existence of a feedback mechanism. That is to say, if a
company tolerated conﬂicts and allowed different opinions to be expressed, then the
organization would become more ﬂexible and open for change. The more
employees were allowed to express their opinions, the more information regarding
the ever-changing environment would ﬂow through the company, allowing the
management to more effectively adapt to economic changes and increase the
company’s competitiveness. In short, conﬂicts have a positive function; thus
beneﬁting the organization that allows for them.
A much-debated question is whether or not functional explanation is actually a
new and distinct type of explanation. Jon Elster has answered in the negative,
suggesting that functional explanation can be reduced to either action explanation
(if one assumes an individualistic perspective) or causal explanation (if one
assumes a collectivistic perspective). For, how does the feedback mechanism
work exactly? That a social phenomenon fulﬁls a function means that (assuming
methodological individualism) every individual involved is aware of what deci-
sions are considered rational and that the sum of these decisions lead to a certain
social phenomenon being reproduced. For example, a political party exists only so
long as a number of people actively decide to be members of that party. Thus the
correct type of explanation in regards to the existence of political parties (in the
individualistic perspective) is action explanation. In other words, the existence of
168
9
Explanation in the Humanities and Social Sciences

political parties, organizations, corporations, or other social phenomena is never an
unintended side effect. On the other hand, if we assume that the individual agents’
beliefs and desires are, in turn, determined by social situations those agents ﬁnd
themselves in, then an explanation with the agents’ beliefs and desires as the
explanans is not satisfactory. Rather, the explanans should be comprised of a
description of the social context and causal connections responsible for these
beliefs and desires. According to this perspective, the individual’s beliefs and
desires are caused by external circumstances, which means that the feedback
mechanism must be described as a causal connection, reducing the functional
explanation to a causal explanation. In the example taken from Merton’s investi-
gation one does not assume any conscious intent to streamline the organization
behind the agents’ actions. The feedback mechanism must then be a causal mech-
anism. Merton’s explanation is thus a good ﬁt for the causal model of explanation,
given that we ask ourselves why conﬂict-ridden organizations exist and prosper.
Functional explanations are apparently inspired by evolutionary biology, where
the surface structure of many explanations is to explain the existence of a certain
trait of a species in terms of its role, or function, in the survival of that species.
However, this is only a surface explanation, and requires deeper analysis. A more
complete evolutionary explanation can be formulated in the following way. A
random mutation in the genetic make-up of an individual may give it a new trait,
or property, which increases its chances of survival and reproduction. Thus it is
likely that this individual will produce more offspring than the other members of its
species. This results in an increase of individuals with the same beneﬁcial property
in the next generation. After a certain number of generations, this property will have
spread throughout the entire species. Thus we have a fundamentally causal expla-
nation of the spread of a certain property or trait. The feedback mechanism is purely
causal, and the only non-causal element in the explanation is the appearance of
spontaneous mutations.
If we now compare this with possibly similar mechanisms in e.g. organizations,
the question becomes, what produces the feedback mechanism? If such a mecha-
nism exists, and is such that it works without people being conscious of it, then it
must be a causal mechanism, as in biology. If, on the other hand, the feedback
mechanism is a conscious activity, reﬂecting our behaviour so as to better achieve
our goals, then what we have is an action explanation at the collective level.
According to Elster, there is no such thing as functional explanation, distinct
from causal explanation or action explanation; a conclusion that I ﬁnd well
grounded.
Without going any deeper into this discussion, one can clearly see that there is an
intimate connection between the type of explanations one deems correct for the
social sciences and the basic views one has of humans as social creatures.

Summary
The debate about explanations in social and human sciences is multifaceted. The
fundamental dispute concerns deep metaphysical issues about the relations between
individuals and society and how one conceives a human being, a person. The
dividing line goes between those who conceive individual human beings as basi-
cally independent of society and other persons, (which seems to be implicit in the
liberal political tradition), and those who rejects this view, holding that a human
being is constituted by its social relations. At the methodological level this distinc-
tion becomes methodological individualism versus methodological collectivism.
The individualist view on man is the default option in the western intellectual
tradition, but there are good arguments for the other view.
Exercises
First, discuss whether the following explanations are expressions of methodological
collectivism or methodological individualism. Then discuss which model of expla-
nation best ﬁts the argument.
1. (Translated from J. Elster: Økonomi og historie, Pax forlag, Oslo, 1972, pp
61–62)
The pre-industrial society could best be described with the word ‘stagnation’. The economy
was trapped at a low level, in a vicious circle of mechanisms inhibiting growth. Technical
development stood still because the investment level was so low that capital-consuming
investments never left the ground. This was partly caused by the fact that productivity was
so low that there was rarely any surplus left for investment, and partly by the lack of interest
in investments among members of the ruling class in the pre-industrial farming society.
They preferred a life of luxury, and any money left over was saved instead of being placed
into productive investments. At most, they bought more land or more slaves, but invest-
ments in the mechanization of production were seldom made. The productivity of the
workers was low because of a lack of proper tools, and because they were so malnourished
they could not work effectively. It was no use to raise their salaries, because workers
preferred working less to earning more money. Malnourishment and disease kept the
population low. War and theft regularly stopped society from building up a continuous
surplus. On the whole, it seemed as if the entire society was organized to make economic
growth impossible. As soon as there was a slight increase in one sector of the economy,
other mechanisms soon reduced this sector to its previous level. An increase in the standard
of living brought about an increase in population, which soon reduced the standard of living
again. An increase in the level of education brought about a shift from productive work to
unproductive activities such as administration and commerce. The efforts made to cultivate
more land in order to feed the increasing population led to soil erosion and
overwatered soil.
2. Why are birth-rates lower is Western Europe than in Asia? Economic historians
maintain that there must be a rational explanation for this difference. Indeed, one
may ask oneself why people in South-East Asia do not try to reduce birth-rates in
order to reduce the number of mouths to feed.
E.L. Jones proposes an explanation in his book The European Miracle. The
difference has to do with the fact that the risk of natural catastrophes is much
greater in South-East Asia than in Western Europe. After a catastrophe in which
170
9
Explanation in the Humanities and Social Sciences

many people die, such as an epidemic, hurricane, or ﬂood, people must restart
their food production as soon as possible. This requires that a substantial work
force is still available after the catastrophe; hence families try to produce as
many children as possible so that this may be the case. This need is not present in
Western Europe, where wide ranging catastrophes hardly ever occur. For exam-
ple, pandemics such as the Black Death are quite rare. This pattern has been
present for a long time, and the modern possibility of transporting food over long
distances where it is needed has not yet affected reproductive trends.
3. In a game theoretic study, The Peter Principle Revisited: A Computational Study
made by Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda and Cesare Garofalo, the
authors give an explanation why bosses so often are clearly incompetent for
their jobs.
Here is the abstract, adapted from http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0455.
In the late sixties the Canadian psychologist Laurence J. Peter advanced an apparently
paradoxical principle, named since then after him, which can be summarized as follows:
‘Every new member in a hierarchical organization climbs the hierarchy until he/she reaches
his/her level of maximum incompetence’. Despite its apparent unreasonableness, such a
principle would realistically act in any organization where the mechanism of promotion
rewards the best members and where the mechanism at their new level in the hierarchical
structure does not depend on the competence they had at the previous level, usually because
the tasks of the levels are very different to each other. Here we show, by means of agent
based simulations, that if the latter two features actually hold in a given model of an
organization with a hierarchical structure, then not only is the Peter principle unavoidable,
but also it yields in turn a signiﬁcant reduction of the global efﬁciency of the organization.
Within a game theory-like approach, we explore different promotion strategies and we ﬁnd,
counterintuitively, that in order to avoid such an effect the best ways for improving the
efﬁciency of a given organization are either to promote each time an agent at random or to
promote randomly the best and the worst members in terms of competence.

10.1
Introduction
The goal of the sciences is to discover scientiﬁc laws, many say and according to
Hempel’s model of explanation we need laws for scientiﬁc explanations. Some
examples of such laws are Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion and Newton’s
law of gravitation.
Within the natural sciences it is largely uncontroversial to claim that the goal is
to discover the laws of nature. Thus one might similarly think that the goal of the
social sciences is to discover the laws of society. However, many have claimed, for
various reasons, that there are no social laws to be discovered. Presently, I will not
take a stance in regards to this issue. Instead, I shall focus on the discussion of the
concept of a scientiﬁc law, taking its use in the natural sciences, in particular
physics, as my starting point. As we will see, there are many deep controversies
about the concept of scientiﬁc (or natural) law and e.g. van Fraassen claim that there
are no laws, neither in the social nor in natural science.
But the term ‘law of nature’ and its associates are often used both by scientists
and laymen and it is an important task for philosophy of science is to give an
analysis of this concept. The questions to be answered include: What is a law? What
conditions must be met for something to be called a law? Why do we sort out some
parts of scientiﬁc theories and attribute to these a special status?
It has proven astonishingly difﬁcult to give generally acceptable answers to these
questions. John Earman has characterized the debate as follows:
It is hard to imagine how there could be more disagreement about the fundamentals of the
concept of law of nature – or any other concept so basic to the philosophy of science – than
currently exists. A cursory survey of the recent literature reveal the following oppositions
(among others): there are no laws of nature vs. there are/must be laws; laws express
relations between universals vs. laws do not express such relations; laws are not/cannot
be Humean supervenient vs. laws are/must be Humean supervenient; law do not/cannot
contain ceteris paribus clauses vs. laws do/must contain ceteris paribus clauses.

One might shrug of this situation with the remark that in philosophy disagreement is par
for the course. But the correct characterisation of this situation seems to me to be ‘disarray’
rather than ‘disagreement’. Moreover, much of the philosophical discussion of laws seems
disconnected from the practice and substance of science; scientists overhearing typical
philosophical debates about laws would take away the impression of scholasticism – and
they would be right! (Earman 2002)
In particular I agree with Earman’s last remarks, that the debate is disconnected
from the practice of science and that it has an air of scholasticism. I will try to avoid
these defects in what follows.
10.2
Empirical Generalizations: Fundamental Laws
In the discussion about laws one may ﬁrst distinguish between empirical general-
izations and fundamental laws. An example of an empirical generalization could be
All grass is green, if it is alive.
An example of a fundamental law is
Energy is constant in any closed system (Principle of Energy Conservation).
Empirical generalizations are direct generalizations of singular, observable facts
of the form ‘the grass on my lawn is green’, ‘the grass on my neighbour’s lawn is
green’, etc. Once we have collected a sufﬁcient number of instances, and no
counter-instances, we are inclined to infer empirical generality and the result is
sometimes called a law. Conversely, a single counter-instance forces us to reject the
empirical generalization.
Fundamental laws, on the other hand, are not bound in the same way to one type
of observed phenomena. The energy principle, to take the most obvious example, is
so generally applicable that it holds for the most disparate systems. Whether
studying a cell, an atom, an aquarium or even our own solar system, the principle
of energy conservation is valid for all. Furthermore, energy is an abstract property
that cannot be measured directly, although it manifests itself in many different
forms such as potential energy, kinetic energy, mass, electricity, etc. Therefore, if
we were to observe an event in conﬂict with this principle, there are several
possibilities for saving the principle from refutation. For example, one could
claim that the measuring device was faulty, or that the system was in fact not
closed. Summarizing, one could say that even if the distinction is not entirely clear,
it is intuitive that there is a signiﬁcant difference between empirical generalizations
and fundamental laws.
A large number of empirical generalizations have proven to be logical conse-
quences of more fundamental laws. A good example is the ideal gas law
174
10
Scientiﬁc Laws

pv ¼ nRT;
ð10:1Þ
which states that for any quantity of gas, the product of its pressure (p) and volume
(V) is proportional to the product of its number of moles (n) and temperature
(T) (R is the general gas constant.). It is a well-known fact that this law is a
consequence of the energy principle, given certain simplifying assumptions
concerning gas particles. But the general law of gases was discovered before the
molecular theory of gases was in place; it’s status was ﬁrst that of an observed
empirical regularity, and much later was it discovered to be a consequence of
energy conservation.
Sometimes we make empirical generalizations that later prove to be false. Many
would perhaps be willing to accept the proposition ‘All adult swans are white’ as an
empirical generalization. Yet, this proposition is false, since there exists black adult
swans. Thus ‘All adult swans are white’ is not a law.
An interesting question here is whether all true empirical generalizations are
logical consequences of some fundamental laws. The answer is unknown.
10.3
Deterministic and Statistical Laws
Some laws are deterministic, and some are not. Coulomb’s Law – which says that
the electric force between two charged bodies is proportional to the product of the
two charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them–
stands as a good example of a deterministic law. If we know the state of a system
consisting of two charges (and nothing else) at one point of time, we can determine
its state at any other time, using Coloumb’s law, provided the system is not
inﬂuenced by other charges. An example of a statistical law is that which concerns
the radioactive decay of the Carbon-14 isotope. The probability of decay of a single
C-14 nucleus during a time interval of 5730 years is 50 %. Even if we know the
precise state of such a nucleus at some point in time we cannot determine its state at
other times with certainty; at any point of time it may have decayed or it may not.
However, if we consider a sufﬁciently large number of such nuclei, more than
1020 or so, then we can treat this decay as the following deterministic law: after
5730 years, 50 % of them will remain. Hence we do not have to give a probability
distribution given the degree of precision in such cases. However, in the case of
individual atoms, we cannot know which atom will decay, or when. All we can say
is that the probability that a given atom will decay within 5730 years is 50 %. Thus
at the microscopic level, we can only describe radioactive decay using a
statistical law.
It may seem reasonable to assume that if we had a better theory, we would be
able to predict when, and under which conditions, the decay of an individual
10.3
Deterministic and Statistical Laws
175

nucleus occurs. But why does it seem plausible that our present theory is incom-
plete? Is it not just as plausible that nature is inherently probabilistic?
Among present day atomic and nuclear physicists, the general opinion is that
there is genuine randomness in nature and that the statistical character of radioac-
tive decay does not depend on our having failed to describe all of the relevant
factors. On the contrary, many believe quantum mechanics, which is the theoretical
foundation for radioactive decay, to be a complete theory in this sense. However,
some people are seriously convinced that nature must be deterministic. For exam-
ple, Einstein is reported as once saying ‘Der liebe Gott wu¨rfelt nicht’ (‘The good
Lord does not play with dice’) (One should not infer that Einstein was religious in
any usual sense; it is quite clear from his writings that for Einstein this was a
metaphorical way of saying that there is no randomness in nature.).
Further examples of statistical laws are some heredity laws. For example, we
know that having brown eyes is a dominant trait, whereas having blue eyes is
recessive. Thus if a child has inherited the gene for brown eyes from one parent,
then that child will also have brown eyes. Conversely, for a child to get blue eyes it
must inherit genes for blue eyes from both of the parents. If one of the child’s
parents, e.g. the father, has brown eyes, but one of the child’s grandparents on the
father’s side has blue eyes, one can conclude that the father only has one gene for
brown eyes. If the other parent of this child has blue eyes, then the child has a 50 %
chance of getting brown eyes. This can be formulated into a heredity law in the
following way:
For all x, if x is human, the probability for x having blue eyes, conditional on x
having one blue-eyed and one brown-eyed parent, and one of the brown-eyed
parent’s parents being blue-eyed, is 50 %, i.e.,
8xP Bx
Ax

ð10:2Þ
where Bx stands for ‘x has brown eyes’ and Ax stands for ‘one of x’s parents is
brown-eyed, the other is blue-eyed, and one of x’s grandparents is blue-eyed’.
10.4
The Extension of the Concept of a Natural Law
By the term ‘natural law’ we usually intend not only things so called, such as
Newton’s laws, but various principles, postulates, and fundamental equations, such
as the principle of energy conservation, Einstein’s postulate that the velocity of
light is a constant upper limit for all velocities and Maxwelll’s equations. Why are
these superﬁcially quite different things grouped under the term ‘natural law’?
Furthermore, there are laws, which appear to be no more than deﬁnitions of
quantities. One such example is Ohm’s law, U ¼ RI, which states that the voltage
(U) across a resistor is equal to the product of the resistance R and the electric
current (I). Looking at the quantities that make up the SI-system–the international
176
10
Scientiﬁc Laws

standard system of quantities and units–we can easily convince ourselves that
Ohm’s law is used to deﬁne one quantity in terms of the other two. For a long
time, resistance was deﬁned in terms of voltage and current. However, some years
ago one reversed the order; with the help of the quantized Hall effect one was able
to give a very accurate and operational determination of resistance. Thereafter,
Ohm’s law became a deﬁnition of current in terms of resistance and voltage.
The philosophical debate about laws has not addressed the question whether a
deﬁnition could be a law, so I will postpone this question aside for the time being
and return to this issue in Sect. 10.7. For now, lets focussing on some
uncontroversial examples of laws, since it is an astonishing fact that there is deep
disagreement about the concept of natural law, but common agreement about quite
a number of concrete examples, such as Newton’s laws, the principle of energy
conservation and Maxwell’s equations. But if so, do these quite different kinds of
propositions really have anything in common deserving philosophical interest?
10.5
Laws and Accidental Generalisations
One might assume that, since all parties in the debate agree on a number of prime
examples of natural laws, they agree on the criteria. And in fact they do to some
extent. A formal property of all laws is generally accepted viz., they are universally
generalized conditionals. This applies even to such laws as the ideal gas law or
Coulomb’s law, i.e. laws usually expressed as equations. The latter is given by the
equation:
F ¼ k q1q2
r2 :
ð10:3Þ
This formula is to be interpreted as ‘for all pairs of bodies with charges q1 and q2
respectively, there is a force F proportional to their product, and inversely propor-
tional to the square of the distance r between them’. It is implicit that this law holds
only if no other forces act upon the charged bodies. Likewise, it is implicit that this
law generally applies. If we were to make these implicit conditions explicit, then the
complete interpretation of the above formula would be the following:
For all pairs of bodies with charges q1 and q2, with a distance r between them, the force
between them is
F ¼ k q1q2
r2 ;
ð10:4Þ
given that no other forces act upon them.
Examining the statement above, we see that (1) it is a general statement, (2) that
it is of the form ‘if p, then q’, and (3) that it contains a version of the so-called
ceteris paribus clause, viz., ‘given that no other forces act upon them’ and (4) it is
10.5
Laws and Accidental Generalisations
177

true. Ceteris paribus conditions are always contained in the application of scientiﬁc
laws to concrete situations, and are often implicit. However, everyone agrees that
(1) and (2) are necessary conditions for all scientiﬁc laws, whereas ceteris paribus
conditions are not considered constitutive of the concept of a law, even though they
are often implicitly assumed.
Have we now given the necessary and sufﬁcient formal conditions for a prop-
osition to count as a law? No! There are many statements that fulﬁl these require-
ments and yet are not laws. One example is
All the coins in my wallet are made of copper.
(Let’s suppose it is true.) This is a general statement that can easily be
reformulated into ‘for all x, if x is a coin in my pocket, then it is made of copper’.
Thus it fulﬁls criteria (1) and (2); yet it is obvious that this statement is not a
scientiﬁc law, even though it is true. Such statements are called accidental
generalizations.
How does one distinguish between laws and accidental generalizations? This is
the core question concerning the concept of a law, and a number of ideas for solving
this problem have been proposed. We shall discuss three of those ideas here.
(i) A true law supports a so-called counterfactual conditional, whereas an acci-
dental generalization does not. A counterfactual conditional is a sentence of
the form ‘if x, then y’ in which both the antecedent and the consequent are
false. Often they are expressed in subjunctive mode: ‘if x were the case, then y
would be the case.’ For example, the sentence ‘if Bill Clinton had told the truth
when under oath, then he would not have been impeached’ is a counterfactual,
since the antecedent is false. Clinton did lie under oath about his relations with
Monica Lewinsky, and he was impeached.1
Now compare the following two statements
1. All spheres made of gold are less than 1 km in diameter.
2. All spheres made of U-235 are less than 1 km in diameter.
U-235 is radioactive and ﬁssible; its cricital mass is 52 kg (a sphere with
diameter of 17 cm) which means that a sphere with a diameter bigger than
17 cm will start a chain reaction and explode. (This is the principle for
constructing an atomic bomb.) So it is impossible to have a solid sphere of
U-235 of any size. Hence (2) must be true and we consider it a law, since it can
be derived from basic principles of nuclear physics that it is impossible to
collect a sufﬁciently large amount of U-235 without it exploding. In contrast,
(1) is not a law, even if it is true, but an accidental generalisation. It just so
happens that gold is not that concentrated (And if we would ﬁnd an enormous
1 Clinton was US president 1993–2000. He had an affair with Monica Lewinsky, who had an
internship at the White House.
178
10
Scientiﬁc Laws

solid body of gold somewhere in the universe, we could easily increase the
limit and still get the contrast.).
From (1) and (2) we can formulate the following two counterfactuals:
3. If an object were a sphere of gold, then it would be less than 1 km in
diameter.
4. If an object were a sphere of U-235, then it would be less than 1 km in
diameter.
In comparing these two, we are inclined to say that (3) is false, whereas
(4) is true. Thus we may state the following criterion for distinguishing
between laws and accidental generalizations: If one reformulates a law into
a counterfactual conditional, then the resulting sentence is true, whereas, if
one reformulates an accidental generalization into a counterfactual condi-
tional, then the resulting sentence is false.
But what grounds do we have for saying that (3) is false? If we interpret
(3) as a material conditional (see Appendix), then it follows that since the
antecedent is false, the whole sentence is true (See the discussion regarding
conditionals in the Appendix). This shows that counterfactual conditionals
cannot be interpreted as material conditionals. Thus the question regarding the
conditions under which a counterfactual is true cannot be answered by inves-
tigating the truth-values of the antecedent and the consequent separately.
There must be something in the connection between the antecedent and the
consequent that is relevant to the truth of a counterfactual. But how shall we
express this connection?
The general idea is to analyse counterfactuals in terms of possible worlds. A
counterfactual is true if there exists a possible world in which both antecedent
and consequent are true, otherwise false. So when we declare (3) false we
mean that there is a possible world in which there is a sphere of gold bigger
than 1 km in diameter.
But, then, one may ask, how do we distinguish possible from impossible
worlds? A natural way do this is to say that possible worlds are those in which
the natural laws are valid, but then we are back were we started. Other
alternatives have been proposed, but, as Earman pointed out in the quoted
passage, no idea has won general acceptance.
(ii) The second idea for a criterion to distinguish between laws and accidental
generalizations is the observation that accidental generalizations refer, though
perhaps only implicitly, to a particular location in time and/or space, whereas
laws do not make such speciﬁcations. The American philosopher Nelson
Goodman has criticized this idea by arguing that every law-like generalization
is logically equivalent to a formulation that contains such a reference to space
and time. The example Goodman gives is the law-like generalization ‘all grass
is green’, which obviously is equivalent to ‘all grass in London and every-
where else is green’. The difference between law-like and accidental general-
izations, therefore, cannot be that the latter contains a spatial reference, since
all law-like generalizations are equivalent to statements containing such
10.5
Laws and Accidental Generalisations
179

references. One is now tempted to propose the following improvement: spatial
reference in a law-like generalization is always redundant, whereas in acci-
dental generalization it is not. Another way of formulating this criterion is to
say that in accidental generalization, the spatial or temporal reference is
necessary, whereas this is not the case as regards laws. However, this formu-
lation immediately raises the question as to what one means by the concept of
necessity as it is used in this context.
Regardless of whether this attempted solution bypasses Goodman’s cri-
tique, there seems to be accidental generalizations that do not make any spatial
or temporal references, as in the case of (1) above. Hence (redundant) spatio-
temporal speciﬁcation is not a characteristic by which one can distinguish laws
from accidental generalizations in all cases.
(iii) A third alternative in the analysis of a law, which has been quite popular over
the last two decades, is to claim that laws express physical necessity. It seems
reasonable to say that it is necessarily true that bodies with mass gravitate
toward each other, and that it is necessarily true that charged bodies act on one
another with electrical forces. It is necessarily true that there cannot exist large
concentrations of U-235, but it is not necessarily true that there exist large
concentrations of gold. Thus a law has three signiﬁcant traits: a law is general,
it has the form ‘if x, then y’, and it is necessarily true.
How should one analyse the concept of physical necessity? It is obvious that
‘necessity’, as it is used here, means something other than logical necessity: there
are no logical reasons for why charged bodies act on one another with electrical
forces.
There are presently several ideas for analysing physical necessity, but none of
them have succeeded in overcoming the scepticism of empirically minded philos-
ophers. These philosophers afﬁrm that a theory is either true or false, and the only
possibility we have of determining which is the case is to compare the theory with
our observations. An observation must be formulated into a statement, thus
enabling us to compare the theory’s empirical consequences with that observational
statement. The most we can say is that the empirical consequences are true or false.
However, a theory’s empirical consequences are independent of whether or not we
view an individual statement of that theory as a law or not. In other words, we
cannot empirically determine whether a theory is comprised of laws or true
accidental generalizations. But if we assume the empirical principle that there
must be some empirical basis for distinguishing between physically necessary
and accidental statements, then we must discard the concept of physical necessity
as inessential metaphysics.
Metaphysically inclined philosophers disagree; they hold that laws are meta-
physical relations between universals and we need such things in order to explain
regularities in nature. Let us illustrate with Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation, which says that
the divergence of the electric ﬁeld is proportional to the enclosed electric charge.
The metaphysical explanation of this would be something like: the two universals
electric charge and electric ﬁeld are such that in all possible worlds they are so
180
10
Scientiﬁc Laws

related to each other that it makes every instance of Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation true
(This is an application of the general idea that relations between universals are
truth-makers for true sentences.). In other words, it impossible that Maxwell’s
equation could be false. This is, of course, a very rough description of one
metaphysical explanation of the necessity of laws, but even more elaborate ones
are, in my view, hardly convincing or explanatory. Do there really exist any
universals, and why are they related so as to make our laws true? And more
important, it is certainly not an analysis of what physicists intend when they say
that Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation is a law.
10.6
van Fraassen’s Alternative
Bas van Fraassen, who is arguably the leading empiricist of our time, has discussed,
in detail, all of the main attempts at analysing the concept of a scientiﬁc law in
terms of necessity and has concluded that they are all unsuccessful (see van
Fraassen (1989)). He has subsequently proposed that we give up the concept of a
scientiﬁc law as a metaphysical relic. He ﬁrst argues that this concept is not needed
in science, since all conclusions that are made can be motivated without assuming
the existence of some special category of statements, scientiﬁc laws, which has
some characteristic properties beyond truth and universality.
van Fraassen’s second argument for this point is that laws can be replaced by
certain symmetry principles. These symmetry principles are conditions for our
descriptions of nature, and not conditions for nature itself. The following example
may help clarify this point. When we describe the motion of a body, we must use a
coordinate system and a clock. It is obvious that our choice of origin and directions
in our coordinate system, as well as the choice of the starting point of the clock, is
purely conventional; a question of what is the most practical. Hence it is also
obvious that these purely conventional choices must not have any consequences
as regards the content of our descriptions of nature. The statements we make about
nature should be independent of such conventions. Another way of expressing this
point is to say that our theories should be invariant, or symmetric, under a trans-
formation from one conventional choice to another. These requirements of sym-
metry can be either global or local. The global symmetries are
•
Symmetry under translations along the time axis,
•
Symmetry under translations in space,
•
Symmetry under rotations in space.
There are also a number of local symmetry principles, the best known of which is
•
Phase transformation invariance of the electromagnetic potential.
These requirements may appear rather trivial, but it is interesting to notice that
each such requirement of invariance under continuous transformations yields a
conservation principle according to a famous theorem by Emmy Noether
10.6
van Fraassen’s Alternative
181

(1882–1935). The well-known principle of energy conservation is one such law, as
are the conservation laws for momentum, angular momentum and charge. Noether
showed that each such conservation law could be derived from a symmetry
principle. Thus we get the following:
(i) Symmetry under time translations entails energy conservation,
(ii) Symmetry under space translations entails momentum conservation,
(iii) Symmetry under rotations entails angular momentum conservation.
(iv) Symmetry under phase transformations of the electromagnetic phase entails
charge conservation.
There are more symmetry transformations and laws of conservation, but these
are the most central. It follows that these conservation laws are really just conse-
quences of certain conditions for our descriptions of nature. These conditions are
motivated by the requirement of objectivity; our descriptions of nature should be
independent of the observer’s frame of reference. This is hardly a principal restric-
tion on how nature is constructed, but merely on how it should be described. It
seems quite reasonable to require that our descriptions of nature be as objective as
possible; that we purge all subjectivity from the universe, including how we
construct our measuring devices and frames of reference. If so, we may say that
conservation laws are necessary, in the sense that they are necessary consequences
of objectivity demands. And general statements derivable from these conservation
laws (using some deﬁnitions as auxiliaries) may also be said to be necessary and
thus laws.
Conservation laws are fundamental laws, but all fundamental laws are not
conservation laws (e.g. the law of gravity, Coulomb’s law, and Schr€odinger’s
equation). Thus we cannot claim that we have solved the problem of the nature of
a scientiﬁc law through this analysis of conservation laws. Van Fraassen maintains
that one cannot go any further if one wants to stick to empiricist principles.
However, many philosophers disagree with van Fraassen on this point, even those
which are not metaphysicians in the ﬁrst place. In my view they have not been able
to offer a more appealing analysis. In the next section I will propose an explanation
of the nature of some laws, which I think would be acceptable to all empiricists,
including van Fraassen.
10.7
A Proposal: Some Laws Are Implicit Deﬁnitions
of Quantities
Many laws state relations between quantities. Some of these are explicit deﬁnitions,
such as Ohms law, U ¼ RI, (the voltage over a resistor equals its resistance times the
current through it), and some are derivable form other more fundamental laws. But
what about fundamental laws expressing relations between quantities? I will here
suggest an analysis of why such fundamental laws have a special character in our
182
10
Scientiﬁc Laws

theories and why we say that they are necessary. My example consists of two laws
of classical mechanics.
The basic idea is that some laws at the same time are implicit deﬁnitions of new
quantities and empirical generalisations of observed regularities. Their being
empirical generalisations give them empirical content, and their being a kind of
deﬁnition is the reason we say that they are necessarily true.
Classical mechanics is commonly divided into kinematics and dynamics. Kine-
matics describes the motion of physical bodies, usually called ‘particles’ in the
theoretical exposition, since their inner structure is irrelevant, while dynamics is the
theory about interactions between particles (We may treat the earth as a particle if
we don’t care about its volume or inner structure!). Galilei discovered some simple
regularities in kinematics, for example that all bodies have the same acceleration
when falling to the ground and that the distance travelled is proportional to the
square of the elapsed time.
When describing particles’ positions, velocities and accelerations and the rela-
tions between these we only need two fundamental quantities, time and distance.
Velocity and acceleration are also needed, but they are not fundamental, they are
deﬁned as the ﬁrst and second time derivative of distance. That we have two
fundamental quantities in kinematics is a consequence of the fact that we need
two measuring instruments, a meter stick and a clock, to measure and observe the
values of the kinematic quantities. One also needs some geometry and arithmetic,
of course, but these disciplines belong to mathematics; no measuring instruments
are needed in pure mathematics.
How, then, do we proceed to dynamics, i.e., a theory about interactions between
physical bodies? The actual history is illuminating. According to Rothman (1989,
p. 85) it was John Wallis who took the ﬁrst step in advancing a successful dynamics.
In a report to Royal Society 1663 Wallis described his measurements of collisions
of pendulums. Huygens and Wren then performed similar experiments and Newton
used their results in his Principia. He described their experiments and ﬁndings in
the section Scholium following corollary VI in the ﬁrst section of the ﬁrst book of
Principia.
In modernized notation the result of these collision experiments is that there is a
constant proportion, an observed regularity, between the velocity changes of two
colliding bodies:
Δv1
Δv2
¼ constant;
ð10:5Þ
which can be written
k1Δv1 ¼ k2Δv2
ð10:6Þ
The minus sign is introduced so as to have both k1 and k2 positive. By testing with
different bodies (which was done by Huygens) we will ﬁnd that the constants really
are constants following the bodies, i.e., they are permanent attributes of the bodies.
10.7
A Proposal: Some Laws Are Implicit Deﬁnitions of Quantities
183

These constant attributes are their masses, and we may chose a mass prototype
giving us the unit. So we have the following law:
m1Δv1 ¼ m2Δv2
ð10:7Þ
This is the law of momentum conservation, a fundamental law in physics. It is at the
same time an observed regularity and an implicit deﬁnition of a new theoretical
quantity, mass.
People have objected to this, saying that a proposition cannot at the same time be
a deﬁnition and a generalisation of empirical observations. They are wrong. The
fundamental point is that, in order to be able to formulate the generality that all
bodies are such that their collisions satisfy Eq. (10.7), we need the concept of mass
and this concept was not available earlier, nor is it deﬁned by any other quantitative
relation. It was invented precisely for the purpose of expressing the regularity that
Wallis, Huygens and Wren found. Equation (10.7) function as implicit deﬁnition of
mass (An explicit deﬁnition of mass in terms of other quantities is impossible, since
it is one of the fundamental quantities in physics.).
Moreover, as Quine forcefully argued, the distinction between analytic and
synthetic sentences cannot be upheld (see his Two Dogmas of Empiricism.2), and
those who criticizes the idea that one and the same proposition can both be an
implicit deﬁnition and an observed regularity presumably would motivate their
criticism by saying that a deﬁnition is analytically true and an empirical general-
isation is synthetically true.
Newton published Principia 23 years after Wallis reported his ﬁndings to Royal
Society. He begins Principia by deﬁning mass as ‘quantity of matter’, (on page one
in the main text), but this deﬁnition only gives us an intuitive meaning of the word
‘mass’, it does not tell us how to measure it. Wallis, Huygens and Wren had long
before the publication of Principia provided that without using the word ‘mass’;
they in effect introduced this quantitative predicate in physics.
If we now divide both sides of Eq. (10.7) with the collision time, we get
(neglecting the difference between differentials and derivatives since this is of no
relevance for the present argument):
m1a1 ¼ m2a2
ð10:8Þ
Let us further introduce the term ‘force’, labelled ‘f’, as shorthand for the product of
mass and acceleration. This gives us Newton’s second and third laws:
N2 : f ¼ ma
ð10:9Þ
2 In his (1953), pp. 20–46. See also his (2004).
184
10
Scientiﬁc Laws

N3 : f1 ¼ f2
ð10:10Þ
Thus we have got Newton’s second and third laws based on an observed regularity,
viz., momentum conservation during collisions between bodies.
Many readers would, I guess, oppose my saying that Newton’s second law is an
explicit deﬁnition of force, since forces usually are thought of as causes, viz., the
causes of bodies’ accelerations, which conﬂicts with saying that the term ‘force’
simply is shorthand for ‘mass times acceleration’. But if so, what is here cause and
what is effect? Newton’s third law tells us that we can either focus attention on the
motion of body 1 and ask about the force on it from body 2, or the converse), no
cause-effect distinction can be made. This is also the modern view in physics,
instead of talking about causes, one talks about interactions. So I reject the common
interpretation of Newton’s second law as a causal law; this interpretation is in fact
inconsistent with Newton’s third law.
Newton himself appears to have thought of forces as causes. But that cannot be
correct and perhaps a remnant from Aristotelian thinking about motion.
It is thus a bit misleading to say that Newton discovered his second law; it is
more correct to say that he changed the meaning of the word ‘force’, which was
used in ordinary language long before Newton, when he established his second law.
What he discovered was that, contrary to the Aristotelian view that matter and
quantity are distinct ontological categories, to every body he could attribute a
quantity of matter, i.e. mass. We may carefully observe that mass is not a directly
observable quantity and it is not the same as weight! This is the core idea, which
entailed a radical change of our entire thinking about motion.
In this example we have talked about mechanical forces. This is no real restric-
tion; it is well known that there is, as far as we know, four fundamental kinds of
interactions in nature, gravitation, electromagnetism, the weak and the strong
nuclear force, and the same reasoning applies in all these kinds of interactions.
Mechanical interactions, by the way, are electromagnetic interactions.
It seems to me correct to say about science that inventing and deﬁning new and
precise concepts and establishing laws are two sides of the same coin. This is very
clearly the case in classical mechanics. Neither the concept of mass, nor the modern
concept of force, was used or known before Galilei and Newton; The introduction
of these concepts and the establishment of the law of momentum conservation and
of Newton’s laws cannot be separated either historically or conceptually.
Let us now proceed to the law of gravitation:
F ¼ G m1m2
r2
ð10:11Þ
Since (i) we earlier have introduced the concept of mass in the law of momentum
conservation, (ii) force is shorthand for mass times acceleration and (iii) distance is
a kinematical quantity, it appears that this must be a purely empirical law; all
concepts are earlier deﬁned. But that is really astonishing: how could it be that four
10.7
A Proposal: Some Laws Are Implicit Deﬁnitions of Quantities
185

quantities, deﬁned by other relations, always and exactly relate to each other
according to Eq. 10.11? It seems to be a truly cosmic coincidence!
I don’t believe in cosmic coincidences, and in fact neither do we have any such
here. As Newton himself realised, the mass concept utilized in this law express
another property than the mass concept occurring in our descriptions of collision
experiments. The law of gravitation describes how physical bodies interact at
distance, whereas the law of momentum conservation describes how bodies interact
when they collide. We have two distinct mass concepts, gravitational mass and
inertial mass. And we may say, just as with the law of momentum conservation, that
the law of gravitation at the same time is an implicit deﬁnition of gravitational mass
and an empirical generalisation found by observing e.g., how planets move around
the sun and Jupiter’s moons move around Jupiter.
The remarkable thing is that inertial and gravitational mass, although conceptu-
ally distinct properties, always are exactly equal! This is truly astonishing! Newton
realised that gravitational and inertial mass was different properties, but had no
explanation of their equality. This conundrum was not explained until the advent of
general theory of relativity; and the explanation is the most natural one, viz., that
gravitational and inertial mass really is the same property, because gravitation and
inertia at bottom is the same phenomenon.
Summarising my account of classical mechanics: we have two fundamental
laws, momentum conservation and the law of gravitation, which each have a double
function; they are each an implicit deﬁnition of a new quantitative predicate and at
the same time expresses an inductive generalisation of observations. Newton’s
second law is an explicit deﬁnition of force and Newton’s third law is a direct
consequence of momentum conservation, given the deﬁnition of force.
What, then, about the necessity of laws? First, deﬁnitions, both implicit of
explicit, are necessary conditions for the use of the deﬁned terms in our theories.
Second, logical consequences of deﬁnitions are necessary consequences of these
deﬁnitions, since necessity distributes over logical consequence. So we have an
account of why we think of laws as necessary.
Medieval philosophers distinguished between necessity de dicto and necessity
de re; necessity de dicto is a necessity in what is said, whereas necessity de re is
necessity in the object, viz., that the object talked about has a property, or stands in a
relation, by necessity. Applying this distinction, we see that the necessity of both
the fundamental laws and of those laws derived from them, are species of necessity
de dicto. It is the statements that are said to be necessary. It does not follow that the
objects talked about have any properties by necessity and independently of how we
characterize them. So empiricist scruples about metaphysical necessity are
satisﬁed.3
3 If we formalise a sentence claiming the necessity of a law as ‘N “L”’, i.e., treating ‘necessary’ as
an abbreviation for ‘necessarily true’, i.e. a second order predicate and the sentence ‘L’ as an
argument) one blocks the distribution of necessity into the law sentence since one cannot distribute
inside quotation marks, and hence the attribution of necessary properties to things.) Cf. Quine:
‘Three grades of modal involvement’, pp. 158–176 in his Quine (1976).

Scientiﬁc Laws

There are, for sure, several laws that are not deﬁnitions of quantitative concepts,
or consequences thereof, and this account obviously doesn’t apply to these. But
some progress is made, or so I hope.
10.8
Summary
Scientists and others often use phrases such as ‘natural laws’, physical postulates’,
‘fundamental principles’ ‘NN’s law’, ‘NN’s equation’ etc. The things denoted by
these phrases are often referred to as ‘laws of nature’ in the philosophical debate.
Philosophers disagree sharply about the concept of natural law. Some say that it
is obvious that there is a certain category of propositions, laws, which differ from
other true propositions of the same logical form, accidental generalisations. Many
of these philosophers think that the property of being a law is based on a kind of
metaphysical necessity. Other philosophers of a more empiricist bent disagree and
point out that the predictive power of a theory does not depend on whether some of
its propositions are called laws or not; calling some true propositions ‘laws’ is
unnecessary metaphysics. This empiricist argument is convincing, but why, then, is
the concept of natural law, used not only by philosophers but also by laymen and
scientists? Surely, this concept serves some purpose, although perhaps not a
philosophical one.
For four types of laws it is possible to give an explanation of our propensity to
call them ‘laws’ and treat them as having a special status of being physically
necessary, without assuming any kind of metaphysical necessity. The ﬁrst type
comprises conservation laws, each of which can be shown to be a consequence of a
certain objectivity demand on our descriptions of the events in nature. The second
type comprises some equations, each of which may be viewed as an implicit
deﬁnition and at the same time an empirical generalisation of observations. The
third type consists of explicit deﬁnitions of one of the quantities used in the
respective equation. Finally, those true generalised conditionals that can be derived
from the three types above are also labelled laws.

Chapter 11
Theories, Models and Reality
Structure is what matters to a theory, not the choice of
objects.
W. V. O. Quine
11.1
Introduction
We use the concept of a theory essentially in two distinct ways. In certain situations,
we make a distinction between theoretical and empirical propositions, where we use
the concept of theory to mark a contrast with observations and things inferred from
these. In other situations, the point of the concept of a theory is primarily to contrast
theory with reality, observed or otherwise. It is in this second sense that we say of a
hypothesis that it is ‘just a theory’ where we are allowing that the world may be
such that the hypothesis is false. If one could claim that the content of observations
are ‘pure reality’, then there would be no difference between these two ways of
using the concept of a theory; but unfortunately, as we saw in Chap. 4, observation
sentences are often theoretically loaded. One can say that when we use the concept
of a theory in the ﬁrst way we want to stress the abstract nature of a theory, whereas
in the second usage we want to stress the provisional nature of a theory as a picture
of reality.
In many cases, the concept of model is used as a synonym for theory, where
‘theory’ is interpreted in the second sense. In this chapter, we shall dig a little
deeper into the meaning of theories as models of reality.
That a model and what it models resemble one another is easily understood in the
case of a concrete object such as a toy car, but what does it mean for a theoretical
model to resemble the part of reality it models? An example is helpful.
Example: Maps and Reality
The ﬁgure below shows a map of Stockholm’s commuter train network. The map
exhibits an essential property of the commuter train network, namely, the topology
of its various connections between stations. From the map one can, for example, see
that one can travel directly from Jakobsberg to Stockholm Central Station and that
on the way one will pass four stations (Barkaby, Spa˚nga, Sundbyberg and Karlberg)
(Fig. 11.1).

However, one cannot see how long the distance is, how windy the track is, or
how long it will take to travel; the metrical properties of the commuter train
network are not displayed, only the topology.
Two interesting questions immediately arise: (1) is it, in principle, possible to
construct a model that gives a complete picture of a part of reality, and (2) if we had
such a model, and if we knew that it was complete, should we then call it a model of
reality? We shall return to these questions later on. First, we must more precisely
understand what is meant by a model resembling reality.
I propose that resemblance must be some kind of structural similarity between
the model and reality. Structural similarity can, in turn, be understood in two ways.
In certain cases are we interested in special relations between parts of reality
(things, properties, measurement results, etc.), while in other cases we are interested

11
Theories, Models and Reality

in certain kinds of operations or actions that can be performed on the various
elements of reality. In both cases our task is to ﬁnd a representation of these aspects
using a model. The ﬁrst type of structural similarity is the simpler of the two, so we
shall begin with it. We shall then discuss the second type, which may be understood
with help of the mathematical concept of isomorphism.
11.2
Structural Similarity as a Mapping of Relations
In some scientiﬁc disciplines theories are not mathematically formulated for vari-
ous reasons. Nevertheless, one often uses models for describing reality. A common
example is the use of causal models. These often take the form of diagrams where
one indicates causal relations between different factors using a series of arrows. The
following diagram is such a causal model, displaying the causal network behind
myocardial infarction (Note that this is only an illustration and is not meant to be a
correct model of the causal network!).
The fundamental structural relation in this diagram is an arrow starting at one
box and ending at another. This arrow represents a causal relation; the factor in the
box where the arrow starts is a cause of the factor in the box at the arrow’s point.
One important feature of causal relations that is visible in this model is transi-
tivity: if A is a cause of B, and B a cause of C, then A is an (indirect) cause of
C. Following the arrows in the above diagram yields precisely this. However, what
is not shown is the relative strength of the different causal factors. This is a general
characteristic of all models; they display certain aspects of reality while leaving out
others (Fig. 11.2).
An interesting question with regards to the present example is whether the model
is complete in the sense that it contains all the causal factors. Generally, this is not
the case as typically such models only include those causes that are known/
suspected and signiﬁcant. Naturally, this question is not one that can be ascertained
from the model alone; rather, one must compare the model with reality.
11.3
Mathematical Models
The two models above display non-quantitative relationships between parts of
reality. In contrast, some sciences make extensive use of mathematical models
that give information about quantitative relationships between observed properties
of objects. One example that is often discussed is the ideal gas law: the product of
the pressure (p) of a gas and its volume (V) is equal to the product of the amount of
matter (n), the gas constant R, and the temperature (T); pV ¼ nRT. What is essential
is that the model is structurally similar to (observed) reality in the form of mea-
surements on portions of gases. The mathematical formula expresses relations
11.3
Mathematical Models
191

between certain properties of any speciﬁc quantity of gas. However, it is not stated
that this description of gases is complete, or even exactly correct.
The concept of structural similarity is usually speciﬁed within mathematics as an
isomorphism, which is the idea of two sets having the same structure regardless of
the nature of the elements in those sets. It is tempting to say that the observed
measurements are isomorphic to the ideal gas law, but it requires a rather detailed
discussion about set theory, groups, and measurements to show that. Suppes (2002)
contains a detailed analysis of the notion of an isomorphism and results of
measurements.
Normally, an equation functions as a model only under certain conditions. In the
case of the ideal gas law, it is derived from the assumption that gas particles have no
inner structure, that there are no forces active between them and that all collisions
between them are elastic. However, from our background knowledge about mole-
cules it is easy to understand that if the pressure or temperature is sufﬁciently high,
then the gas particles will spend more time near one another. But if the gas particles
spend more of their time in close proximity, the forces between them that we
previously discounted will be stronger. In effect, what we have is no longer an
ideal gas. Could the model be improved by removing one or more of the

restrictions? Yes, in this case, taking into account interactions between gas particles
gives us a more complicated law called van der Waal’s law, which is valid in more
cases.
Is this process of successive improvement by adding structure always possible?
Most scientists seem to assume this to be the case. In fact, this assumption has been
conﬁrmed on a number of occasions, such as the addition of quantum and relativ-
istic effects in the case of the ideal gas law. But is there a limit beyond which no
more improvement of a model is possible? An obvious limit is the case where one
can construct a complete model in which all observed and unobserved phenomena
are captured by the model. Naturally, one can never be certain that such is the case,
but if we were to have such a model, we would have reached the limit of
improvement.
However, if it is not the case that our model is complete, is it then always
possible to make such a model better? James Brown has presented an interesting
argument for this possibility:
We already have set theory in our possession. In some important and relevant sense we can
grasp it. When we do science we in effect assert that some part of the physical world
(or even the whole universe) has the same structure as some mathematical object. Since the
realm of sets provides all possible mathematical structures, any way that the world could be
is exactly isomorphic to some set-theoretic object. Since all of these mathematical struc-
tures are graspable in some relevant sense by the human mind, any way that the physical
world could be is also graspable by the human mind. Of course, any alleged isomorphism
between the physical world and some set-theoretical structure is a conjecture, which may be
false; science after all, is very difﬁcult and very fallible. But there is no way of thinking
about physical reality which is ruled out by our genetically cognitive capacity, since
(standard) set theory can provide the representation of any possible way reality might
be. The mere fact the we possess set theory shows that there can be no (non-logical)
constraints on our thinking. Brown (1994, p. 76)
The crucial point is that set theory is so ﬂexible and general that any thing
whatsoever can be represented by a mathematical object constructed using set
theory. This is not the place to scrutinize the argument for this statement, let me
simply state that I agree with Brown on this point. A thorough analysis of these
matters are found in Chaps. 2 and 3 in Suppes (2002).
Another thing to notice is that Brown clearly hold that the world is in some
deﬁnite way independent of our ideas, concepts or theories. This is the basic idea in
realism. Some philosophers deny that such realist theses are meaningful or com-
prehendible, thus expressing a form of anti-realism. Anti-realists have further
claimed that wave-particle dualism in atomic physics supports this view.
11.4
Wave-Particle Dualism
The well known phenomenon that reality’s smallest pieces, neutrons, protons,
electrons, photons, neutrinos, etc., show both particle and wave behaviour raises
a central question; is it in principle possible to ﬁnd only one model for a certain part
11.4
Wave-Particle Dualism
193

of reality? All observable features of the micro world are captured, as far as we
know, by quantum mechanics, but we need two models for thinking about the micro
objects, viz., the particle model and the wave model. Thus quantum mechanics
represents, in a certain sense, the dualistic character of elementary particles. This
provides a strong reason to doubt the idea that theories, conceived as models, can be
improved until they give a complete description of the external world. This in turn
raises the following question regarding a theory’s relation to reality: Are theories
merely models that describe observable phenomena as the anti-realists claim, or do
(the best) theories describe reality, not only observable traits, as the realists claim?
This conﬂict does not concern what we know, but how the world actually is and
what is meaningful to say of it.
A realist might formulate wave-particle dualism as: reality, as it were, show two
faces in our experiments, the wave face and the particle face. This does not mean
that the two models do not concern reality. One could still claim that we have yet to
construct a more complete model, which encapsulate both wave and particle
behaviour in one model.
However, according to Bohr, this is not possible; nature has complementary
properties,
which makes the completion of either model so as to cover all
phenomena, impossible. That two properties are complementary means that the
conditions for observing these two properties in the same system are mutually
exclusive. It is important to note that the properties themselves are not contradic-
tory, but the conditions for ascribing these two properties to a system are. Con-
cretely, this means that in certain situations, when we arrange for observing
positions of particles, which are decided by how we arrange our experiments, the
conditions for observing wave behaviour are not fulﬁlled and cannot be fulﬁlled. In
other situations, where the conditions for observing particle behaviour are not
fulﬁlled but the conditions for wave behaviour are, we observe only wave behav-
iour. It is not possible to conceive of situations arranged such that both types of
properties are observable, according to Bohr. The conditions for observing particle
behaviour and wave behaviour are logically incompatible.
One is now prone to ask whether the objects under observation do not simulta-
neously have both wave and particle properties (which would explain why we
cannot observe them at the same time), or whether it is only a principal limit of our
ability to measure and observe the micro cosmos that hinders us from simulta-
neously observing particle and wave behaviour. This is a controversial question in
the philosophy of physics. I believe that the ﬁrst alternative is the correct one. In
short, in motion from one place to another all electrons, protons, photons, etc., have
wave properties (wavelength, frequency, extension in space), while during interac-
tions (collisions) they have particle properties (deﬁnite position, energy, momen-
tum). This makes it possible to construct a model that fulﬁls the requirement of
structural similarity to the reality that presents itself in all of our observations. And
this has been done! That is what we have in quantum mechanics. This theory is a
mathematical model, which, as far as we know, represents all observable phenom-
ena in the micro domain. Antirealists have always claimed that this purely math-
ematical structure cannot be given one uniﬁed visualizable interpretation in terms
194
11
Theories, Models and Reality

of things moving around in space, hence, we should accept that realism is
disproved. This is a highly controversial issue. I do think quantum mechanics, as
we now know it, can be given a visualizable interpretation, but this issue is far
beyond the scope of this chapter.1
11.5
Can One Measure Structural Similarity?
In some areas of research and technology, such as image reproduction, one is
interested in measuring how good a copy is or how structurally similar two different
objects are. Could it be measured? In the case of similarity between images we have
the SSIM index, which measures the structural similarity between two images. It is
valued between 1 and 1. When two images are nearly identical, their SSIM is
close to 1, see Wang et al. (2004). The function ssimval ¼ ssim(A, ref) in Mathlab
computes the SSIM value for a picture A, with ‘ref’ as reference picture.
Another measure of structural similarity, to be applied to graphs displaying
business processes, is presented in Dijkman et al. (2009).
11.6
Ontology and Structural Similarity
Suppose that we have succeeded in constructing a mathematical model of reality
that is perfect in the sense that all observable phenomena ﬁt in with this model. How
do we know that the model is not reality itself? The answer may seem obvious.
Models and reality are entirely different types of things. In many cases, a model
consists of mathematical objects that represent real things and their properties. This
is the fundamental relation, and it is obvious that we could not talk about something
representing something else if we could not distinguish the two relata. The funda-
mental difference is that the elements of the model are mathematical objects,
whereas the elements of reality are physical objects, things that can be found in
space and time.
Is this difference between model and reality actually important for how we think
about models and theories? Quine has claimed that ‘structure is what matters to
science and not the choice of its objects’ (Theories and Things, p. 20.). What he
means is that from a scientiﬁc perspective it does not matter whether we suppose
that physical reality is built of particles, ﬁelds or even some type of mathematical
object (n-tuples of numbers) so long as the sets of these objects have the same
structure. This stance also implies that one can assert the existence of abstract
things like numbers, functions, social institutions, etc., without dwelling in specu-
lative metaphysics. The essential step in constructing theories about, e.g., social
1 I have given my view on quantum mechanics in my (2007).
11.6
Ontology and Structural Similarity
195

institutions is that we clearly state how these postulated entities relate to each other
and to statements about observable phenomena. However, science cannot answer
the ontological question of what there is in the world, independently of which
theories we use; we can only say things like, ‘according to theory T, there exists
objects of kind K, and since we have very good evidence for T and it is presently the
best theory available, it is reasonable to assume that there exists K-things.’ Now
assume that we make progress and construct a better theory T0, which assumes not
objects of kind K but other kinds of objects. So we have changed our ontology, but
what we have not changed is some structural features, in one of the senses here
described. So structure is what really matters. This is not an uncontroversial stance,
quite the contrary, but the arguments in its favour are stronger than one might think
at ﬁrst glance.

The Mind-Body Problem
‘O blithe little soul, thou, ﬂitting away,
Guest and comrade of this my clay,
Whither now goest thou, to what place
Bare and ghastly and without grace?
Nor, as thy wont was, joke and play.’
Hadrian, on his deathbed (Translated by A. O’Brien-Moore)
12.1
Introduction
What is the relation between the body and the soul, or mind? Is the mind something
that exists independently of the body? Or are the body, speciﬁcally the brain and
nervous system, and the mind merely two different descriptions of the same thing?
Our common sense understanding, which is riddled with religious inﬂuence, leans
towards the ﬁrst alternative. But then what is the mind? How do the mind and the
body interact, if they are in fact fundamentally different things?
If one assumes the former position, one is a dualist and if one assumes a variant
of the latter position, one is a monist. There are many versions of monism but
basically only two versions of dualism, substance dualism and property dualism.
Dualists and monists face completely different requirements for explanation. If
one believes that body and mind are not two different things, but rather one and the
same, then what is wanted is an explanation of how mental processes occur in the
brain. Such an explanation requires a reduction of the mental to the physical. There
are several examples of successful reductions that illuminate how this requirement
might be met in this case. One such example is the reduction of genes, hypothesized
by Mendel as the carrier of inherited traits. Originally, this concept was a purely
theoretical construction. After the discovery of the DNA molecule in the 1950s, one
was able to guess that genes were parts of nitrogenous base sequences in the DNA
molecule. This was latter conﬁrmed when speciﬁc gene sequences were identiﬁed
along with their phenotypic expressions. As this is an on-going investigation, the
details of the reduction are still to be worked out; but one can justly say that the
problem of reducing phenotypic traits to heritable genes, now conceived as
sequences in DNA molecules, has been solved in principle.
The monists think that an analogous reduction of mental phenomena to physical
processes in the brain is at least in principle possible, while others hold that

199

reduction, in the sense of identiﬁcation types of mental states with types of
physiological states, is impossible. But this rejection of the possibility of reduction
must not be taken as an argument for dualism. One position, eliminative material-
ism, holds that there is no scientiﬁc role for mental phenomena to play; hence they
can be eliminated from a scientiﬁc description of the human being. The argument
justifying this elimination is based on logical and semantic analyses of the reduc-
tion concept, as well as analyses of the concept of a mental state.
Nowadays, all monists are materialists; that is, people who think that external
reality is material in nature (The concept ‘material’ should be understood here in
terms of modern physics. Since energy and matter are equivalent, according to the
well-known formula E ¼ mc2, even energy belongs to the material world.). The
opposite thesis–that external reality is mental in nature–is also a form of monism.
This latter view is very unusual in recent times, but has had some signiﬁcant
proponents, for instance, Leibniz and Berkeley.
Dualists face a completely different explanatory task; they must explain how it is
that the body and the mind can interact. All hitherto known theories of how objects
interact are strictly physical in that they describe how physical objects interact via
one of the four fundamental natural forces, gravitation, electromagnetism, weak
and strong nuclear interaction (Materialism is nowadays identiﬁed as the thesis that
ultimately all that exists are physical in nature.). If the mind is a non-material
object, then no purely physical theory about its interaction with the body can be
given. Indeed, the idea that the mind is non-physical, together with the observation
that bodily and mental states can causally interact with each other, conﬂicts with a
basic tenet of our scientiﬁc thinking, namely, that the physical world is causally
closed. Nothing non-physical, if such a thing exists, can inﬂuence something
physical (For example, abstract things like numbers are non-material things and
they cannot possibly be causally related to anything in the physical world, in fact
not to anything whatsoever.). This idea is seldom expressed explicitly, probably
because most take it to be obvious and without need of conscious expression; but
nevertheless, it is fair to say that it is a ﬁrmly held tenet of the sciences.
12.2
Substance Dualism
Substance Dualism is the theory that there are two types of substances, or entities:
bodies and minds. Property Dualism – an alternative dualist theory most notably
championed by Popper1 and David Chalmers2 – stands in marked contrast to
substance dualism in insisting that there is only one type of substance in the
1 Karl Popper, 1902–1994, was born in Austria but worked in England beginning in 1945. His
central works falls within the philosophy of science (see Sect. 12.2).

The Mind-Body Problem

world, matter. Property dualism deserves its name because this single substance has
two irreducible types of properties: physical (including chemical and biological)
and mental. I shall discuss the latter view in the next section.
Descartes proposed the most well-known substance dualistic theory.3 He
claimed that man is constituted of matter and soul, two different types of sub-
stances, each having a fundamental property, or essence. The essence of bodies is
extension, and the essence of minds is thought.
Descartes’ explanatory task was to show how mind and body interact. Starting
from the new mechanical world-view of his time, that all motion is the result of
mechanical interaction, push and pull, which occurs when portions of matter,
bodies with extension, come into contact. In other words, only things with extension
can put a piece of matter into motion. Yet it seems obvious that many of our own
bodily motions are caused by our desires and thoughts, our mental processes in our
soul, and our soul lacks extension.
Descartes’ solution to this problem is to state that the soul is located in the pineal
gland and that mental processes set the pineal gland into motion. The motion of this
gland is forwarded to the rest of the body via the so-called ‘animal spirits’, a viscous
ﬂuid located in the nerves (Descartes, like all others at the time, believed that the
nerves were hollow and ﬁlled with ‘animal spirits’.).
But why would the soul set just this particular gland into motion? Descartes had
two arguments for this. Firstly, since we have only one soul, it must be located in a
central part of the brain that has no duplicate, i.e. the pineal gland. Secondly, there
is a cavity surrounding the pineal gland, which explains, according to Descartes,
how the pineal gland could stimulate motion in the body via the ﬂuid, the animal
spirits, that he believed ﬁlled both this cavity and the nerves.
A moment of reﬂection tells us that Descartes’ explanation breaks with the
principles he himself held: if the mind can set the pineal gland in motion, then
there is an exception to the principle that all bodily motion is caused by purely
mechanical interactions with other bodies. Thus his theory is self-contradictory.
There are still some people who believe in some version of substance dualism,
but none has been able to explain how interactions between mind and matter work.
12.3
Property Dualism
According to Popper, there are three realms: World 1, World 2 and World 3. World
1 is the material world of bodies and physical objects, and World 2 is the matter-
independent world of mental processes. World 3 contains such abstract objects as
3 Rene´ Descartes, 1596–1650, was a French philosopher who spent his last year in Sweden
working for Queen Kristina. He broke with the scholastic tradition of philosophy, using systematic
doubt as a method for arriving at knowledge.
12.3
Property Dualism

scientiﬁc theories, musical works, novels, etc., i.e., cultural products that cannot be
identiﬁed with physical objects.
According to Popper, entities in worlds 2 and 3 have properties that cannot be
explained or reduced to objects and properties in world 1. When a material system
becomes sufﬁciently complicated, new mental, non-material properties arise. Pop-
per has not given any explanation for how or why they arise in a sufﬁciently
complicated system and, without such an explanation, this theory seems to create
more problems than it solves.
David Chalmers has in his (1996) proposed a somewhat similar theory. He
argues that the mental cannot be reduced to the physical; that is, human (and
perhaps even animal) consciousness is a radically different kind of property than
the physical properties used to describe the brain. What we need is a completely
different kind of theory, one that makes room for both physical and mental
properties. Chalmers does not claim to have such a theory. Rather, he claims only
that all previous attempts at reduction have failed, and must fail. Thus the only way
out is to postulate two fundamentally different types of properties as part of an as
yet unknown true theory. The ﬁrst problem that Chalmers focuses on, in regards to
this endeavour, is the so-called ‘problem of qualia’, which we shall discuss in
Sect. 12.6.
12.4
Monism
The principal difﬁculties of dualism have resulted in that virtually all present-day
philosophers are monists as regards the mind-body problem. However, this does not
mean that the philosophical debate surrounding this issue has ceased, quite the
contrary; there is a great diversity of views within monism. Neither does this mean
that one denies the existence of mental properties; rather, it is typically thought that
mental properties are, in some sense, dependent on physical properties. Though,
some do go further and deny the existence of mental properties. In any case, the
least common dominator of monism can be characterized by the following three
theses:
•
Supervenience: If two objects have exactly the same physical properties, then
they have exactly the same mental properties (But not vice versa.).4
•
Anti-Cartesianism: Nothing can have only mental properties.
•
The physical world is causally closed. If x is a physical event, and y is either a
cause or an effect of x, then y is also a physical event.

The ﬁrst principle may seem empty, since it is not likely that there exist two objects
that have exactly the same physical properties. Yet, even if this is the case, it would

not constitute an objection, since if we reformulate the thesis to its contrapositive,
we get the following: if two objects differ in mental properties, then they also differ
in physical properties. Even more relevant is the application of this thesis to
successive states of a single person: if a person experiences a mental change, then
she has undergone a physical change. If, for example, a person were to change
mental state by having a new thought, then this person must also undergo a physical
change. This is what it means for mental properties to supervene upon physical
properties. Supervenience also seems to presume that there are properties, but this is
incorrect: those who generally deny the existence of properties, nominalists, can
express the supervenience doctrine in terms of classiﬁcation of states using physical
and mental predicates, without assuming that predicates refer to properties.
Anti-cartesianism is the thesis that there doesn’t exist any purely mental objects.
It implies, among other things, that the soul cannot live after the body dies. It also
conﬂicts with the idea of reincarnation; that a mind, or soul, with certain properties
can transfer from one body to another.
At ﬁrst glance, the physical world’s causal closure may seem to conﬂict with
everyday observation: is it not obvious that the physical events we observe give rise
to sensations and thoughts? Do not physical events appear to have mental effects?
This would be a strong argument if one presupposes that sensations, emotions and
thoughts have mental properties only. But if one accepts supervenience, then this
argument fails, since the act of having a sensation, emotion or thought is to undergo
a change of mental state, and that is a change of physical state. Thus the question of
how physical and mental changes relate to one another is a question about the
details of monism, for which there are quite different views.
12.5
Monistic Theories
1. Chronologically, the ﬁrst serious monistic theory was identity theory, ﬁrst
proposed by J. J. C. Smart in 1959. According to this theory, when we talk
about a mental state, what we are actually talking about is a certain physiological
brain state. For example, feeling happy, or perceiving the sky as blue, is nothing
more than the brain being in a certain state. Thus the mind-body problem will be
solved once we have matched up every mental state with its corresponding
physiological brain state. A historic parallel from astronomy will help illustrate
how empirical research can result in propositions of identity.
In oldest times it was believed that the Evening star and the Morning star were
two different stars, but the Babylonians discovered that they were actually one
and the same planet, Venus. The expressions ‘Morning Star’ and ‘Evening Star’
thus denote the same thing. Analogously, identity theory monists hold mental
and physical predicates to describe the same events.
There are two variations of identity theory: type identity and token identity.
Type identity states that for every type of mental state there is a neurological/
physiological type of state that is identical to that type of mental state. This
12.5
Monistic Theories
203

means that every time I have the sensation ‘seeing that the sky is blue’ I am in the
same type of brain state. Token identity claims that every token of a mental state
is identical to some token of a brain state, but it is not always the case that e.g. all
instances of ‘seeing that the sky is blue’ corresponds to exactly the same type of
brain state. Thus there can be identity at the token level without there being
identity at the type level. Another way of expressing this is the following:
physical and mental concepts classify phenomena is different ways, though
they do classify the same phenomena; namely, the neurological states of a
person.
An inﬂuential theory that further develops token identity is Donald
Davidson’s5 anomalous monism, but more on this in Sect. 10.7.
2. Functionalism. Functionalism was once proposed by Hilary Putnam6 and many
philosophers and researchers in artiﬁcial intelligence have followed suit.
According to functionalism, a mental term does not refer to any deﬁnite event
or neural process; rather, it indicates a place in a functional system. Thus mental
terms refer to functions in the central nervous system, functions that are carried
out by processes in the brain. However, mental terms do not describe these
processes in terms of which neurons are active or how they interact, but rather in
terms of their input and output signals and what they do; their function. Conse-
quently, the main difference between the functional and identity theories is that a
certain function can be executed by different neurons in different ways.
One can say that the concept of a function and the concept of a process of the
brain are both used to describe a certain part of reality, that which goes on inside
our heads, but that these concepts classify this part of reality in different ways.
Concepts such as brain processes and brain states classify using physiological
criteria, whereas functions apply functional criteria. The following example
illustrates this point.
Assume that I believe it to be cold outside. This belief makes it so that I react
to a certain input in a certain way. If someone were to ask ‘how is the weather?’
(input), I would answer ‘it is cold’ (output). A different output arises if the
circumstances are different. If, for some reason, I were to go on a walk, then my
belief that it is cold will result in my putting on warm clothes before I go out.
Saying about someone that she believes ‘It is cold outside.’ is a description, in
mental terms, of a large set of such input–output functions realized in the body of
this person.
Functionalists do not deny that these input–output functions are performed by
nerve cells in the brain, but the state we describe with the expression ‘believing
that it is cold outside’ does not describe any physiologically deﬁned type of brain
state. It is fully possible that completely different sequences of states can bring
about a connection between an input of the type ‘someone asks about the

weather’ and an output of the type ‘putting warm clothes on when you go out’.
This implies that every system (e.g. a computer) that reacts similarly to a human
with respect to some stimuli is, by deﬁnition, in the same state of consciousness
as a human (Hence research in AI, artiﬁcial intelligence, is heavily inﬂuenced by
functionalist views on the mind.).
A number of versions of functionalism have emerged, what is given above is
only a ﬁrst rough description. For a thorough overview of the different positions,
arguments and problems, see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/
3. Eliminative materialism. According to this view, propounded by e.g. Paul and
Patricia Churchland, our mental vocabulary is misleading, because it presup-
poses that there exist such entities as sensations, feelings, and beliefs. In other
words, use of mental concepts makes us think that they refer to well-deﬁned
objects or processes, and this need not be the case. Once we have achieved a
complete science of consciousness, it will contain no such concepts, but rather
other, scientiﬁcally deﬁned concepts. That is to say, we would have eliminated
our traditional psychological vocabulary. This theory can be considered a
variation of token identity theory, if we add the additional assumption that the
everyday mental vocabulary can be eliminated from a real theory.
Another way of expressing this is the following: if we assume that a reduction
(to be explained in the next section) of mental properties to physiological
properties is, in principle, impossible, then we will have, if and when this
reduction is performed, a number of identity statements of the form ‘mental
state description M and physiological state description F denote the same state’.
These identity statements constitute a sort of psychophysical law. Eliminative
materialism denies that such laws exist because the mental state description is
empty.
12.6
Three Important Problems for Reductionists
Reductionism in general comprises of at least two theses: (i) concepts in the
reduced theory should be deﬁned in terms of concepts from the reduction basis,
and (ii) that laws in the reduced theory can be inferred from the base theory. These
conditions do not follow from the three monistic principles supervenience, anti-
cartesianism and causal closure, thus allowing one to deny that reduction of the
mental to the physical is possible and still be a monist. But reductionism about the
mental faces severe problems, which is the reason why quite a few philosophers
accept monism but are sceptical about reductionism.
Arguments against reductionism are usually based on three purported distinctive
features of the mental that are held to raise profound difﬁculties for reduction.
These features are intentionality, i.e., the property that mental acts are directed
towards objects (see Sect. 5.2), subjectivity and qualia.
(i) Intentionality. Brentano deﬁned the mental sphere in terms of intentionality.
All mental phenomena are intentional, whereas no non-mental phenomena are
12.6
Three Important Problems for Reductionists
205

intentional; intentionality is the distinctive trait of mental phenomena,
according to Brentano. As explained in Sect. 5.2, a mental phenomenon is
constituted by two aspects, an act, which is directed towards an act-object;
intentionality is this relation of directedness from the act to the act-object. A
perception of an object is directed toward the object observed. When we think
about a thing, person, event or theory, this thought is directed towards these
concrete or abstract objects. When we are mad at someone or something, we
feel about that person or thing. In all of these cases, the intentionality is
indicated by the preposition that points to just that at which the mental process
is directed.7 Indeed, most, if not all, mental processes have this intentional
aspect, whereas no material things or processes do.
Possible exceptions to the rule are moods such as euphoria, depression and
anxiety. These states are similar to certain emotions, and yet they lack the
directedness of those emotions. But one could defend Brentano’s stance by
saying that these states are not really mental states, they are physiological
states, which can be clearly identiﬁed by physiological criteria. However, for
the present discussion we need not decide the matter.
But how can one reduce the mental to the material? Given that the act of
reduction removes an important property of the original phenomenon, must
not all forms of reduction involve loss, and so be destined for failure?
Classical reductionism is the thesis that a successful reduction consists in an
analysis of the semantics of mental expressions in terms of non-mental
categories. For example, functionalists think that the mental state of believing
‘It will be snow tomorrow.’ cannot be analysed into two separate parts – the
act of believing and the content of that belief – but rather that the state
description, in its totality, refers to a certain functional state. A certain mental
act, such as the expectation that the weather will be nice tomorrow, is a certain
functional state, but the same act with different content, e.g. the belief that it
will rain tomorrow, is obviously a different mental state. There need not be
anything in common, indicated by the psychological word ‘believe’, to these
two states. The intentionality, i.e. the act-object structure, here has, so to
speak, disappeared from the analysis. Whether this is a failure or a success
of the analysis is debatable.
(ii) Another aspect that disappears in the process of reduction is the purported
qualitative aspect of (but not limited to) experiences. When I see a red tomato,
my experience of that tomato contains a special chromatic quality, which I
recognize and describe as ‘the experience of the colour tomato-red’. This
special experiential quality seems to be missing when we describe the expe-
rience in physical terms. We can perhaps achieve a reduction of the sensation
7 There is a profound difﬁculty with this theory, viz., how to analyse the relation act – object in
cases of non-existing objects, such as Santa Claus. This difﬁculty inspired Husserl and Frege to
develop their theories in quite distinct ways, which gave rise to the division between ‘continental’
and ‘analytic’ philosophy.
206
12
The Mind-Body Problem

of a smell, taste or vision by identifying it with a chain of signals in the brain.
For example, we know that the sense of taste operates with ﬁve basic tastes
(sour, salty, sweet, bitter and umami) and that all tastes can be described as
combinations of these components in various magnitudes. We can thus rep-
resent a certain taste using a quintuple. For example, the quintuple <1, 4, 7,
3, 8> can be interpreted as ‘1 part sour, 4 parts salty, 7 parts sweet, 3 parts
bitter and 8 parts umami’. It is even possible to identify such quintuples with
signals in the part of the brain responsible for the sense of smell. However, the
purely qualitative aspect of the sensation, how it feels to smell wild straw-
berries, or how it feels to see red cherries (not the associations we often
attribute to the sensation, but the sensation itself), also seems to disappear in
the process of reduction, regardless of which form we apply.
We should note that the qualitative aspect plays no role in the use of
qualitative words, such as ‘red’ or ‘the smell of wild strawberries’. Each
child must learn her native language by interacting with competent language
users and the only way to learn the correct use of for example the word ‘red’ is
to observe the situations in which adults indicate the correct and incorrect use
of that word through their behaviour. This requires that the child be able to
identify the common perceptual traits – e.g., the presence of red objects – in all
situations where the word is used correctly. In turn, this requires that the
child’s is able to compare an actual sensory impression with the memory of
past sensory impressions. Thus it is necessary for learning the correct usage of
certain words that we experience qualitative differences and similarities
between various sensations, and that we compare past and present sensations.
The child must be able to remember sensations of colour hues and being able
to classify a present sensation as more like one rather than other remembered
colour experiences.
However, this is obviously a process that occurs within a single person;
there is nothing that guarantees that two people have the same, or even similar,
experience when they see a red ﬂower. The only requirement for successful
verbal communication is that different people apply category words similarly.
Whether different individual’s qualitative experiences differ makes no differ-
ence as regards their classiﬁcation.
Many philosophers have taken for granted that humans have similar, qual-
itative experiences, but such philosophers are immediately faced with the
question of what is meant by ‘similar’ in this context. In order to meaningfully
say that different person’s experiences are similar, or not, we must have a
similarity measure that can be applied interpersonally. But such cannot in
principle be had, since we are things that by deﬁnition are irreducibly
subjective.
If we were to formulate these criteria in terms of the ability to report the
same thing and make similar distinctions in language, then we would have
transformed the qualitative aspect into a matter of behaviour, which is, as we
saw above, something different than the experience itself. But how else should
we formulate a criterion determining whether two individuals have
12.6
Three Important Problems for Reductionists
207

qualitatively similar subjective experiences? If one then abandons the idea of
giving any identity criteria, one also abandons the idea that qualitative expe-
riences are comparable in any way.
However, we might be able to say something about qualia; namely, we can
typically distinguish between cases where qualia are present and cases where
they are not. We can easily imagine two people eating wild strawberries,
where one of which has a nasty cold. One of them says to other, ‘these really
taste like wild strawberries’, and other responds, ‘sorry, but they don’t taste of
anything at all’.
Is it conceivable that a robot without consciousness could behave in a
fashion similar to the people in the above example? Can we conceive of a
robot that could carry on a conversation with humans, behave like humans, at
least in some situations, without having any sort of consciousness, or self-
awareness? Assume that we have succeeded in constructing a prosthetic
tongue and nose, which are wired to a computer. These artiﬁcial organs can
identify tastes and smells almost as well as a human (Suppose that we know a
great deal about the senses of taste and smell.). Signals are forwarded to the
computer, which processes the information through subroutines, thus gener-
ating applicable statements that are sent to the speech organ for communica-
tion. Nothing in this example seems impossible; and yet there is nothing that
indicates that the computer truly feels the taste of the wild strawberries. Thus
in the above example we have a robot that behaves like a human without
having consciousness. It is not difﬁcult to generalize this example to the entire
spectrum of human behaviour. Doing so would give us a zombie, a robot that
behaves like a human but is devoid of an inner life. According to critics of
reductionism, this shows that any such reduction looses the most essential
aspect of conscious processes: consciousness itself.
Eliminative materialists reply that if we can give an explanation of human
behaviour without needing to take into account that some part of our behav-
iour is intimately related to conscious sensation and thought, then this aspect is
irrelevant to scientiﬁc theories about consciousness.
The functionalists, on their part, stress that if consciousness has a function,
then it can be described in terms of certain input–output functions, which are
active when we are conscious and not otherwise. Furthermore, it is the
reductionist’s goal to identify these functions. The purely qualitative aspect
of conscious states, ‘how it feels. . .’, is irrelevant in both cases.
(iii) All mental states are subjective in the sense that no one other than the person
experiencing that state has direct/introspective knowledge of them. Contrarily,
all descriptions of brain states are public, since any observer with the requisite
knowledge and training can observe them. However, this leads to problems for
the identiﬁcation of mental states with brain states. As regards identity theory,
the problem is quite clear. If two descriptions–one in mental terms and another
in neuro-physical terms–describe one and the same phenomenon, then this
phenomenon must have the same properties regardless of the description,
otherwise the two descriptions do not describe the same thing. However, if
208
12
The Mind-Body Problem

something is public then it is not private, and vice versa. Thus all mental
phenomena have a property that all neuro-physical phenomena lack.
In my view, the most serious of the three problems for reductionism is inten-
tionality. Mental directedness appears to be an essential and fundamental property
of mental activities. Every monistic theory must therefore be able to say something
about what this intentionality amounts to in physiological terms, or else convince us
that the act-object distinction is merely a peculiarity of our grammar.
The subjective nature of mental activities does not seem to be as fundamental, or
at least not in the same way. Suppose that the strong form of (type) identity theory
were true (I do not think that this is particularly likely, but the point is to show that
subjectivity is a contingent fact.). Assume further that we have succeeded in
pinpointing exactly which systems in the brain are active when we have a speciﬁc
sensation. One would then be able to know whether or not some person has this
sensation by measuring the activity in these systems using an MRI machine for
example. This would mean that our states of consciousness are no longer subjective,
but rather fully accessible to physiological study.
In regards to the problem of qualia, I doubt it is a real problem for reductionists.
Science aims to describe and explain phenomena in objective, i.e., intersubjective,
terms. Thus giving a scientiﬁc characterization of what the purely qualitative aspect
is, seems to conﬂict with the basic point of science. The purely qualitative content,
the ‘subjective feel’, of the conscious experience, cannot as a matter of principle be
described. Why so? Because using words, language, is essentially an intersubjective
activity and the word ‘qualia’ is intended to refer to that which is not intersubjec-
tive, but purely subjective. But that is impossible, so the word ‘quale’ cannot have
any reference. Hence, not even in the mental sphere is there anything which we
refer to by using the term ‘qualia’.
Wittgenstein’s discussion of these matters in his Philosophical Investigations
will perhaps illuminate this issue. In § 304, he discusses pain, or more precisely, the
experience of pain, imagining an interlocutor that argues with him:
‘But you will surely admit that there is a difference between pain-behaviour accompanied
by pain and pain-behaviour without any pain?’ – Admit it? What greater difference could
there be? – ‘And yet you again and again reach the conclusion that the sensation itself is a
nothing.’ – Not at all. It is not a something, but not a nothing either! The conclusion was
only that a nothing would serve just as well as a something about which nothing could be
said. We have only rejected the grammar which tries to force itself on us here.
I interpret this passage as saying that an individual pain experience cannot be
described as being such and so; one cannot say anything more about the experience
of pain than that one is, in fact, experiencing it. If so, it cannot be treated as an
object for predication.
Suppose I have headache and tell that to someone else. Now why does Wittgen-
stein say that we cannot say anything about it? Why isn’t e.g., ‘headache’ a
description of a certain state? His point was, I think, that if a description is to
have any use in a sentence, it must be possible state criteria telling whether an
object satisfy this description or not and that these criteria must be such that people
12.6
Three Important Problems for Reductionists
209

can agree whether they are satisﬁed or not. But if these criteria in principle cannot
be intersubjectively applied, as is the case of qualitative experiences, then such a
description has no role to play in our language. It would lack meaning. And one
might doubt if it is legitimate to talk about an object about which we cannot say
anything.
What one can do, however, is categorize with reference to external objects or
circumstances. We can distinguish between experiences of red and experiences of
blue because the criteria for this distinction can be formulated in terms of the colour
of external objects. The same goes for pain (We can distinguish between pains in
different parts of the body, for example.).
The idea that Wittgenstein wants to discard is that, since ‘pain’ is a noun, it must
refer to a thing, an object, about which one can make true or false propositions.
According to Wittgenstein, this idea is incorrect. The conclusion is thus that the
words we use to talk about inner states cannot function as terms referring to objects
of any kind. In Wittgenstein’s words we should reject the grammatical idea that
nouns must refer to objects.
Some philosophers, such as Chalmers, have objected to the above conclusion by
arguing, that we need a better theory: our present understanding of mental phe-
nomena is severely incomplete.
A better theory requires new concepts enabling us to formulate more detailed
descriptions of mental states. But Wittgenstein’s point remains. Concepts by their
very nature require criteria for application that can be intersubjectively determined,
and if we by the word ‘quale’ or ‘the quality of a phenomenal experience’ try to
refer to a certain state of mind that by deﬁnition is subjective and not accessible to
other persons than the person who is having the experience, then we have failed to
refer to anything.
Thus, of the three purported features of the mental, intentionality, subjectivity
and the qualitative aspect of conscious states, I think the one to really take care of
for reductionists is intentionality. Subjectivity may not be irreducible and I think we
should dismiss talk about qualia as a philosophical mistake; talking about qualia is
trying to say something where nothing could be said.
12.7
Mental Causes
Light, sound waves and molecules constantly bombard our sense organs, causing
sensations to occur in us, whether we are awake or asleep. Sensations are mental
states that, together with memories, cause other mental states, such as emotions or
expectations.8 These emotions, along with certain beliefs, cause our actions, or so it
8 In Brentano’s distinction between physical and and mental states, sensations are physical states
since they have no act-object structure, which for Brentano was the distinctive trait of mental
states. But here we include sensations as pains in the mental.
210
12
The Mind-Body Problem

is generally thought. These actions often have a physical component; we move our
arms and legs or emit sound waves. According to this description, physical events
cause mental states, which in turn cause other physical events. But how can this be?
Recalling what was claimed in Chap. 7, if an event is the cause (or a cause) of
another event, these events are connected to each other by one of the four funda-
mental types of interactions found in nature. Thus every causal connection between
two events must be a connection between physical events; as previously discussed,
the physical world is causally closed. However, a mental event is not a physical
event, so it seems that we have a problem.
There are three conceivable solutions to this problem. First, one could give up
the principle regarding the causal closure of the physical world. Second, one could
deny that the concept of a cause is applicable to the connection between thoughts
and feelings and our actions, and third, one could say that mental events are in fact
identical to physical events.
The ﬁrst solution has not attracted many supporters for the simple reason that it
involves an abandonment of monism. In contrast, the second view is quite common.
Many have thought that one should not describe thoughts and feelings as causes of
our actions, but as reasons for our actions. Cause and reasons, on this view, are
completely different things, and the concept of a cause in quite simply irrelevant for
the description of human actions and their connection to our thoughts, opinions,
motives and feelings. The problem with this view is that the reasons for our actions
become irrelevant for the execution of them; for, if reasons and causes are different
things, and if there are physical causes of the observable, behavioural component of
our actions, then our reasons do not determine our actions over and above their
determination by the prevailing physical. Reasons become redundant.
The third view is that mental events and states are identical to physical events
and states where the reasons, i.e., motives and beliefs we propose for our actions,
are all physical states of the brain. It may be that one cannot exactly pinpoint which
physical events are identical to which mental states, but this is not a decisive
counter-argument against the idea that mental and physical events are identical,
either at the type or token level.
The weaker stance is token identity; it says that every individual mental event is
identical to some individual physical event, but it does not follow that a certain type
of mental event can be identiﬁed with a certain type of physical event. If, on a
number of different occasions, Lisa is jealous of Karl, then these instances of
jealousy are different individual events of the same mental type. It is conceivable
that every such individual mental state is identical to some physical state in her
brain without every such brain state belonging o the same general type. Indeed,
describing Lisa as being jealous at different occasions may correspond to different
types of brain states on these different occasions. If such is the case, then reduc-
tionism is impossible, since a successful reduction would require psycho-physical
laws connecting mental event types to physical event types. Thus one can be a
proponent of the view that tokens of mental events are identical to tokens of
physical events and at the same time claim that a reduction of types of mental
events to types of physical events is impossible. According to this view, one can
12.7
Mental Causes
211

also claim that a mental event is the cause of a physical event, and vice versa. For, if
the mental event m is identical to a physical event f (i.e. m ¼ f ), and f is a cause of
another physical event g, then m is a cause of g.
This is the core idea in Donald Davidson’s anomalous monism. He strongly
argues for the claim that the reduction of mental events to physical events is
impossible by arguing that there cannot be any strict psycho-physical laws. David-
son admits that one can formulate approximate psychophysical laws, but he thinks
this insufﬁcient for achieving a successful reduction. A full discussion of the details
of his argument will not be given here; only some of the highlights will be
mentioned by way of justifying his non-reductive identity thesis.
One of Davidson’s points is that one can distinguish between stated/believed
motives and actual motives for actions. People in general assume that the motives
for their own actions are good and known to them, and yet others often have strong
suspicions that the true motives are quite different from those the agent would give.
According to one of psychoanalysis’ fundamental assumptions, which most people
accept even though they are sceptical about much else in psychoanalysis, many of
our psychological states are unconscious. So it is quite possible that an agent’s
ofﬁcially stated motive for her action need not be the cause of the action, even if the
agent honestly believe so. It is the real motive of an action that is identical to the
cause of the action; that is, that motive which actually brought about the action, and
nothing else.
12.8
Speculations
One way of trying to understand the relation between the mental and the material,
whilst at the same time take into account the distinctive aspects of mental processes,
is to characterize the surrounding debate as two different perspectives on the same
object. When we use concepts like neuron, brain state and other biological con-
cepts, we assume a third-person, scientiﬁc, perspective where the criteria for using
terms can be made intersubjectively veriﬁable. On the other hand, when we use
concepts like sensation, emotion and thought, we assume a ﬁrst-person perspective.
Thoughts, feelings and sensation are brain states described, using mental vocabu-
lary, by the subject to whom those brain states belong. It is clear, by deﬁnition, that
this is a subjective perspective in which we associate a qualitative subjective
experience with each of the terms, a subjective experience which cannot be
expressed in a third-person perspective. Wittgenstein’s argument, referred to
above, shows that no intersubjective criteria for these experiences can be given.
Unfortunately, common language often is not clear about this distinction.
One way of understanding at least the intentional aspect of sensations is to relate
this aspect to the brain’s ability for sorting external stimuli. Everyone has experi-
enced situations in which our attention is so directed towards something (a thought,
a feeling or some event) that we are more or less oblivious of anything else going on
in our immediate surroundings. This is an extreme situation, but such situations do
212
12
The Mind-Body Problem

often occur, though perhaps to a lesser degree. The brain’s ﬁrst task is always to
ﬁlter the signals coming in through our sensory organs. If we did not have this
ability, we would not be able to concentrate our attention on any one thing; we
would be, in effect, helpless. For example, when we say that we observe a certain
brand of car, or a characteristic smell, we are experiencing an effect of the brain’s
ﬁltration of external stimuli. Those stimuli that remain make their way to the
prefrontal cortex, the centre of consciousness, where they somehow are processed
to become a perceptual object, i.e., a representation of the object towards which we
direct our attention.
This way of thinking yields, in my opinion, a plausible explanation of the
directedness of sensations in physiological terms. However, it does leave one
fundamental question unanswered: what more is required for one to be conscious
of something? Do various signals have to have certain properties, or do they simply
have to reach a particular part of the brain? And what about intentional objects that
do not exist?
12.9
The Science of Man
The expression ‘science of man’ was used by eighteenth century philosophers as
referring to studies of human thinking, feeling and deliberating (The word ‘man’
should here not be understood as contrast to ‘woman’ but to ‘nature’.). It is closely
connected to philosophy of mind. The core problem in philosophy of mind is in my
view how to integrate descriptions of the mind into a biological description of
humans. I’m convinced that the mind, or the soul, is not a separate substance
different from the human body. The mind-body relation is not a relation between
two different things, but a relation, or perhaps a system of relations between two
different ways of describing states of affairs and events within a human being.
When we say about a certain person that she has a certain thought, desire, or
emotion, we apply a mental predicate and say that the person we are talking
about satisﬁes this predicate (See Appendix). When we say about this person that
her central nervous system is in a certain physiological state, we say that she
satisﬁes a biological predicate. Hence, when trying to understand the relation
between mind and body we should study how we use mental and biological
predicates to sort individual person’s states into categories and how mental and
biological predicates are related.
There is little hope of ﬁnding that a certain mental predicate has the same
extension as a certain biological predicate, because we apply rationality principles
when using mental predicates, as Davidson has shown (see Sect. 12.7), whereas no
such principles are operative when we apply biological predicates. Hence, reduc-
tion of the mental to the biological seems, in my view, utterly implausible.
If our goal with the study of science of man is to gain better understanding, we
should use mental predicates in our studies, because ‘understanding’ means know-
ing what beliefs, desires and emotions people has. Many hold that it is difﬁcult,
12.9
The Science of Man
213

some say impossible, to formulate reliable laws, or regularities useful for pre-
dictions, using mental predicates. This stronger stance is taken by Davidson, who
argues against the possibility of strict psycho-physical laws connecting the mental
to the physical.
But I see a way out here, inspired by Freud, the inventor of psychoanalysis.
Freud had patients whose actions appeared irrational in the sense that they did not
seem to follow from the agent’s conscious desires and beliefs. Freud’s idea was that
their actions in fact was driven by unconscious beliefs and desires, they were hidden
from the agent’s own consciousness by a kind of inner censor. Hence introspection
into our own mind is not at all reliable; we often fail to obtain knowledge about our
own desires and beliefs (Psychoanalysis is a highly controversial theory, but the
notion that one may have unconscious desires and beliefs is generally accepted.).
This was, by the way, the same conclusion James Watson (1913), the founder of
behaviourism, drew from the complete failure of empirical psychology during
nineteenth century. So if we want to retain the belief-desire-action model of
understanding humans, we cannot rely on individual subject’s reports about their
own beliefs and desires. But another strategy is possible. Suppose we accept as a
fundamental law: If an agent desires the goal G and has the belief that the best
action for achieving the goal G is to perform the action A, then the agent will do A
(As I argued in Chap. 10, a general statement may be a law, in spite of the fact that it
is, or is part of, an implicit deﬁnition of a term used in the formulation of that law.).
This law can easily be refuted if we identify the goal, the action and the belief
independently of each other. But all three concepts are intentional, so it is obvious
that neither can be directly observed; identifying a particular desire, belief or action
must be done indirectly, via interpretations of observable behaviour, such as
responses to stimuli, answers to questions etc. Just as we identify a certain charge
by observing the motion of a physical body, we may identify a certain belief or
desire by observing the outward aspect of the agent’s action, his behaviour. It might
be more complicated in the mental domain than in electromagnetism, but I see no
principal difference. The crucial restriction is that the agent’s own reports about
his/her desires or beliefs should not automatically count as evidence against such an
attribution, just because such reports are the results of introspection. Introspection
is unreliable.
Daniel Kahneman’s book, ‘Thinking fast and slow’, are full of such examples
(See more about this book in Sect. 14.1). If, for example, the fast system determines
our action, we can describe its operation as that an unconscious belief and desire is
formed such that the appropriate action takes place. One could perhaps object by
saying that unconscious mind-states cannot be beliefs or desires; such states are by
nature conscious. But, again, we have strong evidence that we are not conscious of
most of what goes on in our minds; this was a main reason for Freud to invent his
theory about unconscious dynamical processes. One could be sceptical about
Freud’s theory without denying that the distinction between conscious and uncon-
scious mental states is a distinction with a difference.
In fact, the concepts of belief and desire, in ordinary parlance, has a strong
functional character; they are names for those states of our minds that guide our
214
12
The Mind-Body Problem

actions; and calling a state a belief state doesn’t entail anything about its mode of
operation in producing an action, or that it is conscious. So I see no fundamental
difﬁculty in a science of man aiming both at understanding and at prediction.
Many argue that man and society is so much more complex than simple physical
or chemical systems so that there is no hope of making reliable predictions. But the
premise that man and society is more complex I outrightly reject. Most purely
physical, chemical and biological systems have an enormous complexity, as mea-
sured for example by the number of degrees of freedom. I see no difference in that
respect between a human being, a human being in its environment, or a society and
a system studied by natural science.
A second argument for the difference between science of man and of nature is
that for ethical reasons we cannot perform controlled experiments in strictly
controlled circumstances. This is true, of course, but the same problem is prevalent
also in many areas of natural sciences. One way to overcome this is to study partial
systems and then construct models for their combination; and this can be done also
in the study of man. Another is to use statistical methods, which, as we have seen,
gives some indications about possible mechanisms and causal structures. And this
can be done also in the study of man.
A third argument for the difference between the study of man and of nature is
that humans react and change their minds when being studied. This is certainly true.
Humans are essentially agents whose beliefs, desires and volitions may change
when being described by others, whereas things studied by physics, chemistry or
biology are not in this sense agents, they have no thoughts. But I doubt if this really
is a difference that have methodological relevance. The fact that people are affected
and may change their minds when being subject to actions or descriptions from
other people is a typical example of a feedback mechanism. And the same is true in
micro physics; observing an object means exchanging photons, i.e. portions of
energy with it, and when observing the smallest objects they may change their
state, causing difﬁculties in making predictions. The mechanisms differ, but the
fundamental methodological difﬁculty, to make reliable predictions, is the same.
Still, both in physics and in the study of man we are sometimes able to make
predictions of the evolution of ensembles of individuals, particles in the case of
physics and people in the case of the study of man.
All in all, I see no fundamental obstacle for future progress in the study of man
using mental predicates in the descriptions: And by progress I mean not only to
provide understanding of individuals or groups of individuals and societies, but also
results with predictive force, at least predictions in terms of probabilities.
Discussion Questions
1. In the ﬁlm Alien, there is a scene where two crewmembers of a spaceship
become violently disagreeable and begin to ﬁght. During the ﬁght, one of the
crewmembers falls against a sharp corner. To everyone’s surprise, the
crewmember’s wound does not release blood but hydraulic oil! This
‘crewmember’ was in fact a robot, which the villains had smuggled onto the
ship in order to destroy it.
12.9
The Science of Man
215

Suppose that this robot behaves just like a human; that it speaks, jokes, eats
and so forth. Is it possible that this robot lacks consciousness; that it has no
feelings, thoughts or sensations? If your answer is yes, what more do you require
of the robot for it to be capable of these experiences?
2. Within computer linguistics, researchers are eagerly investigating technology
that can translate one natural language into another, and much headway has been
made. In the E.U., for example, computers are now responsible for the brunt of
the work in the translation of ofﬁcial documents. It does not seem unreasonable
to believe that computers of the future will be able to translate non-ﬁctional texts
just as well as a human. Would we then say that such a computers understand the
meaning of various words and expressions? If not, why would we say that a
human who performs the same task does understand the meaning of the text he
or she translates?

13.1
Values and Their Role in Science
According to a common norm, science should be free of values. This view is based
on the idea that values are subjective, whereas science strives for objectivity.
Today, the view that all valuation is subjective is quite common, but such has not
always been the case. The default view has been that moral and aesthetic judge-
ments are true or false; their content are propositions about moral or aesthetic facts.
If one accepts this traditional view, then the motive for claiming that science ought
to be value-free disappears. For why, then, would one dismiss certain kinds of
descriptive propositions as not allowed in science? However, if one assumes that
value statements are not descriptions of objective conditions but rather expressions
of the speaker’s feelings and subjective attitudes, then the requirement that science
is value-free is extremely well motivated. The view that value statements are not
really statements but rather expressions for our feelings is called emotivism.
The norm that science should be value-free can be interpreted in various ways. A
strong interpretation would be that science should not contain any expression of
values. This is not reasonable since one would perhaps want to investigate which
values there are and what effects they have on the actions of various groups. Such
research cannot be said to break with the norm above. A more reasonable interpre-
tation is that the individual researcher should not express any of his/her own values.
However, one can argue that there could be a researcher who unconditionally gives
a complete and accurate description of the consequences of various measures
(where, for example, a politically relevant issue is being discussed) and concludes
by explicitly recommending a particular measure, based partly on the researcher’s
analysis of the aforementioned consequences, and partly on a clear expression of
the value premises. For the outside reader, it is easy to discern what in this text are
scientiﬁc results and what constitutes valuations. I can ﬁnd no reason to object to
such an exposition.

Upon reﬂection on this imagined case one is lead to formulate a third interpre-
tation of the norm that science should be value-free: one ought not to deduce value
statements from premises that only contain descriptive statements.
This is often shorted to the slogan ‘one cannot deduce an ought from an is’ was
ﬁrst claimed by Hume, and therefore often called ‘Hume’s law’, has much to say for
it; for example, that it is a consequence of our concept of valid inference. Never-
theless, we often ﬁnd argumentation that breaks this rule. Consider the following
example, which mirrors the sentiments now (2015) among lots of Swedes:
The number of immigrants to Sweden has risen signiﬁcantly the last years. Therefore we
should impose stronger conditions for immigrants to Sweden.
That one often makes this jump from the descriptive to the normative in arguing
about political issues is the result of leaving out the intermediate premise (in this
case the premise is ‘the increase in immigration is undesirable’).
Political argumentation, like all use of language, always occurs in a certain
context. The contextual factors help to supplement the message, allowing the author
of that message to treat various things as implicit. The author does not need to say
that which can be presumed to be well known or obvious for their audience. In fact,
it does not even have to be that obvious for their audience, as presuming certain
things to be obvious can be a rhetorical trick employed to increase the weight of
ones arguments.
The difference between common and more scientiﬁc argumentation is, among
other things, that a scientiﬁc argument places greater requirements on the rigor and
clarity of ones premises. This general norm leads to the more precise norm that one
should not leave implicit value premises in scientiﬁc argumentation. Leaving out
such a normative premise in an argument results, just as in the example above, to an
argument breaks with the rule of not inferring an ought-statement from only
descriptive premises.
However, the application of this requirement is complicated by the fact that there
are many words and expressions that are neither purely descriptive nor purely
evaluative. Some examples are words that describe human character traits: ‘uncom-
promising’, ‘inﬂexible’, ‘light-hearted’, ‘thoughtful’, ‘indecisive’, etc. For every
human character trait, it is possible to ﬁnd two (or more) words, one positive and
one negative, such that no matter which we choose we get some measure of
valuation. Another group of examples can be found in political language: ‘free-
dom’, ‘democracy’, ‘prosperity’, ‘society’, etc. It is hardly possible in practice to
avoid such descriptive and yet normatively charged words in scientiﬁc accounts
within, for example, political science, economics and psychology. Therefore, the
norm that one should not deduce normative conclusions from descriptive state-
ments is not so easy to follow. One way to be as clear as possible is by being
extremely explicit in what one packs into these concepts and, for example, by
distancing oneself from eventual evaluative components where appropriate.
Most, but not all, philosophers basically agree with Hume in distinguishing
between facts and values. Hilary Putnam is one who disagrees, see his (2002).

Science and Values

13.2
Value-Free and Value-Laden
It is sometimes claimed that research is not value-free if it is funded and governed
by economic, political or religious groups. The argument is invalid since it builds
upon a confusion of ‘not value-laden’ and ‘value-free’, an important distinction
once introduced by Weber.1 That research is value-laden means that the governance
of research, the choice of which questions that is be the subject of scientiﬁc
investigation, is driven by goals that are chosen with certain values in mind. That
research is value-laden is thus something completely different from not being
valuation-free. Research aimed at ﬁnding better treatment for diseases are certainly
value-laden; we would give very high value to positive results in this area. But, of
course, reports of such results, if they are found, should be value-free; we want
objective knowledge about what to do for curing and/or preventing severe diseases.
That is to say, scientiﬁc activity can be value-laden and value-free at the same time.
In principle, one cannot dismiss a scientiﬁc result with the argument that the
researcher has been paid by someone with suspicious interests. If one does so, then
what you have is an example of an ad hominem argument: the objection to the view
is based on the person who presents the view and this person’s hidden agenda, and
not on the merits of the argument.
However, in practice it is often the case that we are suspicious of results
presented by a researcher who produces results that are favourable to the
researcher’s employers. Such is especially the case as regards politically charged
questions about economic politics, environmental politics, social politics, and so
on. A clear example of this is the discussion regarding the economic development in
Sweden during the period 1970–1995. Many economists, critical of the generally
social democratic politics of this period, concluded that Sweden’s place among the
world’s richest countries has fallen from number 3 at the beginning of the 1970s, to
number 18 during the mid 1990s. Furthermore, many held it conﬁrmed that this
drop is the result of the economic politics during that period, explaining this
development as the result of a sort of sclerosis, a structural rigidity, in Swedish
society that has resulted from too much social politics, wage equalization and high
taxes. But certain social democratic economists, especially Walter Korpi objected
to this analysis; in particular, he objected to the factual claim that Sweden lagged
behind in the development of prosperity. He has objected to the period chosen for
measurement, the choice of countries used in the comparison and the analysis of the
causes cited in the argument. For an outsider, it is naturally difﬁcult to have a
grounded view of this matter, but it is pretty clear that there are numerous judg-
ments intertwined within these economic reports; judgments concerning the rele-
vant measures, selection criteria, objects for comparisons, etc. It is naturally
1 See Weber (2011). For a thorough discussion of Weber’s position on this matter, see Bruun
(2007).
13.2
Value-Free and Value-Laden
219

extremely difﬁcult not to be inﬂuenced by political valuations with respect to such
judgments. However, just as one may be sceptical about statements made by, for
example, corporate economists, since the corporation in question could have its
own interests in changing Swedish politics, one can equally be sceptical of Walter
Korpi’s statements, since he has a strong ideological interest in showing that the
social democratic politics of the day did not have long term negative effects on
economic development. For if such were that case, then one would have to admit
that the crucial parts of the political system were a failure and that the bourgeois
critique was correct (When this translation is ﬁnished, 2015, the politics has been
changed in some of these respects, both by social-democrat and conservative-
liberal governments, and the Swedish economy has regained productivity to a
considerable degree. This indicates that the ‘sclerosis diagnosis’ at least to some
extent was correct.).
In summary, one can say that the fact that a certain research effort is funded by a
proprietor who has a strong interest in certain conclusions, or that the results in
some way stand in relation to the researcher’s non-scientiﬁc interests, provide some
reason for suspicion. Conversely, if a researcher comes to a conclusion that
undermines the researcher’s, or his proprietor’s, economic or ideological interests,
then there is even more reason to believe that the researcher has been very careful in
her attempts at validating her results. However, such considerations certainly
cannot be viewed as relevant arguments for, or against, a concrete proposition
within a scientiﬁc debate. One must, under all circumstances, make the effort to
take a stance regarding the matter itself. Regarding the concrete issue discussed
above, concerning economic policy in Sweden, I have no competence to judge the
matter.
13.3
Is Science Valuable?
There is almost universal consensus concerning the value of science and that it is a
good thing to spend some of the taxpayers’ money on research. Many researchers
think that one should spend still more money on research, but one could suspect
self-interest to bias them on this issue, but virtually no one opposes spending some
money on research. But there is substantial disagreement concerning what kind of
research should be supported and what ﬁelds of research should be pursued.
But let us proceed to a general perspective; how should we quite generally
motivate spending taxpayers’ money on research? The answer seems obvious; in
the long run taxpayers will beneﬁt from the results, for example by new, more
effective medical treatments and more energy-effective engines being developed.
Of course, it is not just a case of issuing an order to the scientiﬁc community; there
are no guarantees that a particular research project will succeed. Nevertheless, it
seems rational to spend money on a spread of research projects in the hope that
some will be successful. A politician responsible for funding research could argue
220
13
Science and Values

just like a venture capitalist risking his money in quite a number of companies and
projects. The venture capitalist is well aware of the high risks and is prepared for
failure of most of the projects they support. But he hopes that some will succeed,
and that the return on those successes will be more than sufﬁcient to compensate
him for the failures. In the same way a research policy maker should be prepared for
quite a number of projects failing, but hoping that some will succeed in making a
discovery that is so important that it more than fully compensates for all the failures.
Everything so far said presupposes that the point of doing research is that some
results will prove useful. But what is useful? How do we determine that?
When it concerns medical science and technology, broadly conceived, one could
say that useful results are expressed as propositions that have the form of law-like
generalizations, i.e. propositions that can be used for predictions and goal-directed
actions; in other words, knowledge about general causal connections, and the
general aim is mostly to ﬁnd such law-like generalisations. Part of social science
and the humanities also have this aim, but great parts of social science and
humanities cannot conceivably be useful in this sense. Most research in sociology,
history, archaeology or philosophy does not aim at producing law-like and appli-
cable generalizations. Also mathematics and foundational research in theoretical
physics may not be useful in any obvious sense or to any timescale that would
warrant the investment they require. How can such research be motivated?
Quite often defenders of research in humanities say that they are useful in a
broader sense; the result may improve our quality of life. I don’t think it is a good
strategy using the word ‘useful’ for defending research in humanities. The reason is
that this defence glosses over the distinction between things that are useful means to
an end and things that are valuable in themselves, and the default meaning of
‘useful’ is as a means to an end. If an historian argues that research in history is
useful, a sceptic taxpayer could say: ‘Useful for what?’ (Some might defend
research in history with the argument that we can learn from history and avoid
earlier mistakes; but it is doubtful whether different events in history are sufﬁciently
similar to enable useful generalisations.)
Another answer, once formulated by Max Weber, is that the aim of research in
humanities and social sciences (German ‘Kulturwissenschaften’) is to provide
understanding, i.e., understanding of man, culture and history. Understanding of
these phenomena means understanding the meaning of phenomena, i.e., under-
standing which beliefs, emotions and motives that are connected with these phe-
nomena. Hence the goal of research in social sciences and humanities is not
instrumental; these activities are not directed toward aiding us in achieving some
end/goal. Rather, these activities, and the understanding they engender, are goals in
themselves, it is simply things that interest many people.
Philosophy, at least some part of philosophy, mathematics and perhaps some
other disciplines may be said to form a third category of research. Inquiries in these
areas are not useful in any direct sense, nor do they provide understanding of man
and culture in the sense indicated above. These disciplines are best described as
critical scrutiny of our thinking and of development of concepts. Concepts are our
13.3
Is Science Valuable?
221

vehicles for thinking and philosophy and mathematics are concerned with some
very fundamental concepts that can be used in virtually all other disciplines (think
of concepts like knowledge, evidence, proof, function, relation). And this may be
defended as being useful in the very long and very broad perspective.
If we say that some activity is valuable because it is useful in the sense of being a
means to an end, we are only postponing the question of why it is valuable, for why
do we value the end result? Why is it good to cure diseases, diminish famine,
increase productivity or improve our thinking? Obviously, we come very quickly to
things where we will say ‘This is good in itself.’ So the conclusion is that on this
matter all scientists are on an equal footing when asking for money from the
taxpayers. The basic issue is what people want, what they think is valuable in itself.
People value different things and limited resources must somehow be distrib-
uted. The usual procedure of research funding is a two-step process. In the ﬁrst step
representatives for the public determine the general policy (more money on new
forms of energy production, or more money on better crops?) and in the second step
representatives for the researchers determine which projects to support in a speciﬁc
ﬁeld. The idea is that the ﬁrst decision is not a scientiﬁc decision; it is a value-driven
choice, whereas the second decision is expected to be better if made by experts in
the ﬁeld, for they know which projects are more likely to succeed on delivering the
policy goal. But some are suspicious that the selection procedures are not better
than a purely random procedure.
13.4
Feminist Critique: Hidden Values in Science
In later years, feminists have criticised certain research because it is ‘sexist’; that is,
it contains more or less hidden assumptions that imply a devaluation of women. A
clear example is the research surrounding myocardial infarction, which is mainly
done on men. We now understand that myocardial infarction is common even
among women, but the symptoms may be different in women than in men. This
has resulted in an under diagnosis of infarction in women and also in faulty
knowledge of how it should be treated, since the medicines that exists are not
tested on women. It has been claimed that this practically implies a devaluation, or
neglect, of women’s problems.
Another, slightly deeper, form of male narrow-mindedness in science is when
concepts, which are based on cultural phenomena in today’s society, are used as
naturally determined, universal categories. A clear example is when the current
division of labour between the sexes (that men generally engage in outgoing
activities, achievements, careers, competition in the workplace, etc., while
women focus on children, homes and caretaking) is taken as a starting point for
describing social patterns in prehistory. A common account of prehistoric human
development is the following: Our ancestors developed four features simulta-
neously and in intimate interaction: one began to use tools, one began to walk
222
13
Science and Values

upright, one began to hunt, and the size of the brain (and hence energy consump-
tion) increased signiﬁcantly. A natural conclusion from this is that the use of tools
made more efﬁcient hunting possible, which was required to support the larger
brain. Findings of primitive tools, which are assumed to have been used for killing
larger animals, support these assumptions. Thus one is presented with a picture of
typical male behaviour that has driven human development forward. Contrary to
this, ﬁrstly, it has been claimed that the primitive tools that have been found–
differently shaped stones–cannot be unequivocally connected to hunting; they
could just as well have been used to work with plants and roots, or something
else ‘typically female’. Secondly, one can argue that the tools needed to gather
vegetables for eating were generally made of less durable materials such as wooden
sticks, and therefore there is no evidence left that shows how important the
collection of vegetables was for our ancestors. This claim is supported by studies
of present-day people that live as hunter-gatherers, surviving mainly by collecting
fruit, nuts, roots and other parts of plants (which is regarded as typically female
activities). Thirdly, how do we know that the gathering of plants was mainly a
female activity? In short, there is a strong tendency to project the current state of
society on completely different cultures by using categories for sorting data that are
heavily inﬂuenced by the society we live in.
The main point of this critique seems not to be that the scientiﬁc results are false,
pure and simple, but that focusing on certain circumstances and neglecting others is
driven more or less by unconscious norms about what is ‘normal’ male and female
behaviour. One should notice that the word ‘normal’ is ambiguous. It can mean
‘common’ without any valuation, but also ‘natural and right’, which clearly has
evaluative content. Often one shifts between these two meanings without
noticing it.
When we describe our empirical data, we must use general concepts that we as
humans have constructed. But we humans are rarely, or perhaps never, neutral
observers of the external world. That is to say, we are ﬁrst and foremost agents who
often want to understand the world in order to intervene and inﬂuence it. So we
form our concepts, often unconsciously, as a part of our desire to shape the world or
defend a certain way of life. This normative component of the conceptual frame-
work comes to be known as a valuation of what is important, relevant or essential to
a complex phenomenon. The general conclusion one can draw is that the catego-
rization of phenomena is interest-related. This connection to interests is not some-
thing one can get rid of, but one can request that researchers be aware of what
purpose a certain categorization has.
One possible objection to the above is that science should make correct catego-
rizations of phenomena; scientists should describe things ‘as they actually are’.
Even if there is a purpose, it is secondary. For if one has categorized a phenomenon
in a way that does not agree with reality, then it is quite simply false, regardless of
its purpose. This objection is based on a kind of essentialism; things have essential
properties, and it is the task of science to discover them. However, I am quite
sceptical of this view; I share Quine’s hostility towards the distinction between
essential and contingent properties of things, objects, events or states of affairs, for
13.4

the same reasons as he gave.2 Unfortunately, further discussion of this complicated,
but rewarding, topic lies far beyond the scope of this book.
13.5
Research Ethics
Doing research quite often means taking a moral stance, balancing the value of the
possible results against the interest, dignity and integrity of humans involved. Such
balancing has not always been made. An infamous example of research, which
triggered heavy moral critique, was the Tuskagee clinical study conducted between
1932 and 1972 by the US Public Health Service to study the natural progression of
untreated syphilis in African-American men in Alabama. These men were told that
they were receiving free health care from the U.S. government and those who in the
study group who had syphilis, 400 out of 600, were not told about their malady. In
1940 it was established that penicillin was an effective treatment of syphilis. One
would then have expected that the researchers should have ended the study and
given all persons in the study group with syphilis the new effective treatment, but
they did not, neither did they inform them about their disease and its proper
treatment. The study was ﬁnally terminated in 1972, as a result of a whistleblower
reported to the press what was going on and 25 years later, in 1997, President
Clinton formally apologized and held a ceremony at the White House for surviving
Tuskegee study participants. He said:
What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our
heads away. We can look at you in the eye and ﬁnally say on behalf of the American people,
what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry . . . To our African
American citizens, I am sorry that your federal government orchestrated a study so clearly
racist.
This and other cases of morally bad research have resulted in ethical questions
related to research have come increasingly to the fore.
Another example of research, not so malevolent as the Tuskagee study but still
morally doubtful, was Milgram’s well-known experiment for studying obedience.
A number of volunteers were asked to help in carrying out a learning experiment.
These people would give other volunteers certain tasks, and if the latter failed the
task, the former were told to give the latter electric shocks. For each task the
volunteers failed, they would receive more powerful shocks. The underlying
hypothesis was said to be that punishment could be used to improve learning. In
reality, this was a bluff. When the test subjects ﬂipped the switch, no electric shock
was administered, and the person who was supposed to be undergoing the ‘learning
experiment’ was instructed to pretend to feel a shock. Many of the participants went

quite far and, as they believed, ‘increased the intensity of the shock’ more and more,
even though the ‘test subjects’ on the other end signalled that they were in heavy
pain. The point of the experiment was to see how far these volunteers were prepared
to go in causing other people pain if they were instructed to do so by a person in a
position of authority, i.e. the researcher (The sad result of this experiment is that
most participants obeyed even though they believed that they were hurting another
person quite severely.).
One generally accepted norm is that all research where humans are involved
should only be carried out with the participants’ informed consent. This means that
one must inform the participants of the purpose of the research and acquire their
consent to participate. Obviously, Milgram’s experiment strode against this norm.
However, Milgram could defend his actions with the following argument: ﬁrstly, it
would have been impossible to perform the experiment if the test subjects had
known the true purpose of the experiment, and it is important to study people’s
propensity to obey orders even when the people in question believe that doing so
will cause others pain. Secondly, the test subjects were informed after the experi-
ment that these other people had not been harmed. In response to Milgram’s
defence one could argue that it is doubtful if one can draw any general conclusions
from this laboratory experiment, and that it is degrading to be tricked as the
volunteer test subjects had been. This second concern is especially pertinent for
those who were inclined to give their ‘victims’ powerful shocks since they appeared
to the researchers to be quite unsympathetic people.
Another ethical problem in research sometimes arises in the testing of a new
medical treatment. It is often the case that one performs a preliminary control test
after some time has passed to see if there is any difference in the tendencies of the
tested treatment and the treatment that the patients in the control group received.
One example is the testing of AZT to AIDS patients. In a follow-up, it was found
that the patients that had received AZT were in much better condition than the
control group, and so it was decided to end the experiment early and give all
participants AZT, even those who had been given an ineffective drug. This may
seem to have been an unproblematic move, but the researchers were faced with an
important decision. Every general conclusion regarding long term effects of a
certain treatment drawn from a sample test is more or less uncertain, and the
uncertainty is naturally increased the shorter the test lasts. One is faced, therefore,
with the choice between giving all patients the treatment and sacriﬁcing reliability,
or to continue the experiment and risk denying certain patients a treatment that
could have helped them. It may seem to be a rather easy choice, but one ought to
consider that the preliminary conclusion, that the treatment has a positive effect,
could be wrong. In such a case, were one to shut down the experiment and give the
control group the treatment, one would not have helped anyone and would have lost
the possibility of acquiring the more secure knowledge of a complete experiment.
In many countries research founding bodies now require approval from an
ethical committee of a proposed research project involving humans as objects of
study. In addition, researchers in medicine, psychology and some other ﬁelds have
in many countries established ethical codes for researchers and practitioners in their
13.5

respective ﬁelds. As an example of an ethical code in psychology one may consult
American Psychological Association’s ‘Ethical Principles of psychologists and
Code of Conduct’, see http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/principles.pdf (In the liter-
ature list referred to as ‘APA ethical code’). This document states ﬁve general
principles:

Principle C: Integrity.
Principle D: Justice.
Principle E: Respect for People’s Rights and Dignity.

Some Recent Trends in Science
14.1
The Impact of University Mass Education
Since antiquity and until rather recently very few people were occupied with what
we now call science, i.e. systematic thinking about nature, society and humans. This
has changed profoundly the last decades in all western societies, and is on its way in
the entire world. This is, one may assume, related to the expansion of higher
education. Some 50 years ago, relatively few people, less than 5 % in advanced
countries had a university degree, while nowadays it is 40–50 %. One may perhaps
assume that most of what students learn during their academic studies is based on
science and hopefully approximately true. Hence one may entertain the hope that
greater and greater portions on mankind are able to make better decisions, act
cleverer and not so prone to devastating mistakes as in older times. I do entertain
that hope, albeit there is also reason for pessimism.
One such reason may be found in research into human decision-making, as
reported by the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking: fast and
slow. In this wonderful book a huge number of experiments on human thinking is
discussed. Kahneman’s core message is that we have two systems for decision-
making, the fast system and the slow system. The fast system acts unconsciously,
using inherited and early in life learned emotional responses: good or bad for me?
Thus, for example, new faces immediately give us a positive or negative feeling
which guides our actions. Sometimes this fast decision system is very useful, even
life saving, as when we feel a strong impulse to run away from a dangerous
situation. Kahneman’s analysis of this system is that it often uses rules of thumb
and association circuits for producing a quick response. But association mecha-
nisms sometimes produce clearly irrational reactions, via a mechanism called
priming.
The other system is the slow one, where we deliberate, consider alternative
actions, estimate how reliable the available information is etc., in short when we use
our rational faculty. The most interesting result reported in the book is, in my view,

Texts in Philosophy, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-26551-3_14
227

that the fast system often makes the decisions, while the agent himself believe he
has considered the alternatives and can give good reasons for his choice. The
conclusion to draw is that we often think we are more rational than we in fact are.
It is possible to improve ones rationality, and to train oneself to be a bit sceptical
against ones ‘gut feelings’ in situations where there is some time do make a
decision. On the other hand, ‘gut feelings’ may be the result of unconscious
reception of information, of for example other people’s attitudes and emotions,
which they try to hide. So when should one succumb to the ﬁrst thought, to ones gut
feelings? No easy answer is available, so far as I know. Nevertheless, I think one
may entertain some hope that the future for mankind will improve because of
deeper and more widely disseminated scientiﬁc knowledge.
All in all, there is, I think, some hope that more widespread scientiﬁc knowledge
will improve the conditions for mankind, and for many individuals. And in dem-
ocratic societies one may hope that policies will be cleverer if the general level of
scientiﬁc education improves.
14.2
Publish or Perish: The Value of a Research Paper
Not so long ago (100 years?) nearly all scientists were either wealthy men (seldom
women) doing science as a hobby, or university teachers who primarily was hired
for teaching while doing research in their spare time. This has changed. Very few
people do research without being paid for doing just that and universities now select
professors for hire based primarily on their track record as researchers (although
most have a non-negligible teaching load). Professors all over the world now see
their prime duty as doing research. And since the enrolment to university and
college studies has risen tremendously in the developed world, a huge number of
university teachers have been hired. All these people compete for better positions
and promotion, and since the main merit in academia is research results in terms of
scientiﬁc publications, they focus efforts mostly on publishing scientiﬁc papers, not
on their teaching. So, because of the enormous increase in students at universities
there has been an enormous increase in university teachers and thus in the number
of published papers. Hence this increase is to a considerable extent a side effect of
the increase of basic academic education.
Scientiﬁc papers must be read in order to be of any value. Alas, there is strong
evidence that the great majority of scientiﬁc papers are never read by anyone else
than the referees and the journal editor.
First of all the majority of papers are never cited, and secondly, there are ﬁndings
(see for example http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/14-3-5.pdf) suggesting that
only circa 20 % of cited papers are actually read by the citer (This paper I have
read!). One may conclude that only when a paper are cited ﬁve times or more can
we have some conﬁdence that it actually have been read.
One could of course argue that many papers are read without the reader ﬁnding
reason to quote it. This is plausibly true, but it only strengthens the hypothesis that,
228
14
Some Recent Trends in Science

from the mankind’s point of view, most scientiﬁc papers are of no worth. For if a
scientist read a paper but don’t have reason to refer to it in his future research, it had
plausibly no or little impact on this researcher’s thinking.
The researcher’s subjective aim of publishing a paper is his/her own career, as
already pointed out. But why not putting more effort in writing for a broader
audience, thus promoting the general level of scientiﬁc understanding in society?
From a societal point of view it would be clearly rational, but, alas, from the point of
view of the individual researcher it is not, since writing for a broader audience is not
valued in academia. As Nicholas Kristof wrote (New York Times, February
15, 2014): ‘If the sine qua non for academic success is peer-reviewed publications,
then academics who ‘waste their time’ writing for the masses will be penalized.’
One may conclude that in most cases writing a scientiﬁc paper is waste of time.
But there are, of course exceptions, some papers are indeed highly valuable.
14.3
Research Funding and Planning
Could one diminish waste of money and time on bad ideas and increase the
proportion of useful research? I’m sceptical. Research funding bodies must act
just like venture capitalists. Such capitalists, I have been told, select a number of
projects/companies and put in their money in these. They know that most projects
are bound to fail, but since it is impossible to know which, they have to spread the
risks and a reasonable number of projects are supported. Hopefully one or two
succeed so that the return on that investment compensate for the losses on the failed
ones. The decision problem for research funding bodies is similar and they should
apply a similar strategy in order to optimize the value of the research done. I see no
other rational option.
However, those funding research naturally would like to get some guidance on
which projects to support. One could for example look at history of science to see
which kind of strategies have worked in the past. One such idea is give money to
researchers that have a good track record, people who haven proven their ability to
produce relevant new scientiﬁc knowledge. Several research councils have adopted
this strategy of giving money to excellent researchers. Such a strategy will result in
strong bias for senior, or very senior researchers. Is that a good idea? Wouldn’t it be
much better to give money to newcomers, who have new ideas?
The problem of deciding which projects to support and which hypotheses to test
is the question about which inductive inferences to give credence. But this is an
unsolvable problem. It is impossible to give a general justiﬁcation for inductive
reasoning and a fortiori for selecting one project among a number of alternatives
that objectively is the most probable one to succeed.1 There cannot be any way of
1 To use Bayesian reasoning to update one’s credence is no solution, since one must have a prior
probability as a starting point and no objective way of ﬁnding that is available.
14.3

sorting out those inductive conclusions that later will be conﬁrmed and those that
will be falsiﬁed, and hence no good reason to invest resources in one project rather
than another. As Quine once remarked: ‘The human predicament is the Humean
predicament’ (Quine 1969, p. 72). Hence it is no good idea to concentrate too much
resources in any particular research programme, whatever the arguments. Who is to
know that the chosen line of research is not a blind alley?
My conclusion is that the great scientiﬁc achievements the last decades are
explained by the enormous increase in money for research and in number of
researchers. It is like mass bombing from high altitudes of an area: if the bombing
is heavy enough, some bombs will hit the targets. More bombs, more targets
being hit.
14.4
Big Science
Big science began in physics with the construction of big particle accelerators, such
as that at CERN in Geneva or SLAC at Stanford. These investments were not
motivated by any desire to test any speciﬁc hypothesis, but a recognition of the fact
that testing any hypothesis about the fundamental structures of matter require this
kind of equipment (And one motivation for the US congress’ funding such research
was the arms’ race between Soviet Union and USA.). Well, one cannot, as a matter
of principle, dismiss the possibility that it will be possible to probe deep into
microphysics by other, cheaper methods; but so far we see no alternative.
Now we see something analogous in social science, although much less money is
needed. Since the costs of collecting and storing enormous amounts of data has
fallen dramatically one may consider building and maintain really big data bases,
and the parallel rapid development of computers make it possible to survey these
for correlations or other things. We can do data mining. Even though the costs are
minute in comparison with the cost of building and running CERN, there is
nevertheless a somewhat parallel phenomenon, in so far that basic research facil-
ities have been constructed without there were any particular hypothesis up for
immediate test.
Will these investments pay off? Well, I think theoretical physicists would say:
CERN has given us the possibility to test the standard model; furthermore we have
now conﬁrmed beyond any reasonable doubt the Higgs mechanism, predicted
40 years earlier. This is deeply satisfying. But even the opposite result, a discon-
ﬁrmation of the Higgs mechanism would have been exciting, since it had forced us
to accept that there is something wrong with the standard model and new ideas
would have been asked for. So from a scientiﬁc perspective the return of this
investment was really good.
Some European taxpayers may think differently, asking: why should we pay for
this? We can’t see any beneﬁts for us, nor that it has any public interest. CERN is a
playground for academics.
230
14
Some Recent Trends in Science

I don’t know whether these sentiments are common, nor can I see any effective
way to rebut the argument. At bottom, this is a dispute about basic values. If
someone says, in the vein of Aristotle, that man by nature is curious, we want to
know no matter the usefulness of the knowledge, and another says, ‘I disagree and I
don’t want public money to be wasted on that’, I see no rational way to adjudicate
this dispute objectively. Disputes about values are settled at the polling stations in
democracies.
A different, but equally unsolvable problem arises when constructing big data-
bases with all sorts of information about human beings. The costs are much smaller,
and the possible beneﬁt might be easy to argue for, but privacy of individuals may
be threatened. It is common practice to take measures to protect privacy and
integrity of those the data are about, but are these enough? One need to strike a
balance between privacy and usefulness of the data base, and it is bound to be
people disagreeing about the balance.
14.5
The Scientiﬁc Attitude and the Search for Meaning
In Chap. 1 I described the beginning of scientiﬁc thinking as an effort to try to
understand events in nature as effects of natural causes, not the result of interven-
tions of gods, spirits, demons or other creatures with desires, volitions and goals.
In the course of time the idea of natural laws developed and therewith the
conception that events and states in nature, including our bodily states, are deter-
mined by initial conditions and deterministic causes. Hence, there is reason to try to
predict some aspects of future using hypothetical reasoning; if I do such and so,
then that will happen; but I do not want that to occur, so I had better do something
else. And success has sometimes, some might even say quite often, followed.
It should be noticed that such hypothetical thinking might be useful even in the
absence of any detailed knowledge about the mechanisms. Clear examples of this
are observations of how the plague spreads from area to area. Although one had no
knowledge about the agent, bacteria, one could do something to restrict its distri-
bution. During the outburst of plague in England 1665 one took strong measures,
such as putting ships from abroad in quarantine for quite some time, restrict
domestic travels and closing the universities (which, by the way, made it possible
for Newton to return home to his mother’s farm to work on his magnum opus
Principia).
Our possibilities to control our environment has increased tremendously due to
better knowledge about laws and mechanisms. But still there are, in Quine’s words,
unsettling surprises. When such surprises hit us, such as severe diseases, accidents,
tsunamis, etc., most of us are hard to accept that there were no purpose, no reason,
and no explanation. Our desire for an explanation, which provides a sense of
meaning of a personal disaster, is deeply felt and few are by nature prone simply
to accept that one had bad luck.
14.5
The Scientiﬁc Attitude and the Search for Meaning
231

This desire for meaning-giving explanations of the misfortunes in our life is
connected to our natural desire to understand our own life and ourselves. Few
humans, perhaps none, are willing to look back to their own life and view it as a
sequence of events totally without meaning, without purpose. Humans by nature
construct meanings in their own life. We try to integrate random events with dire
consequences into some of meaningful pattern when we reﬂect on our life. It is not
uncommon to hear people saying about such an event that it had a meaning after all;
I learnt something, I became a better person, I met my husband/wife, etc. That is,
even if we know that it was a random event, we give it a meaning ex post facto.
Pious Christians in particular try to see a meaning also in severe suffering (it make
you a better human, more humble, more compassionate). And many people, when
they look back at a disaster in earlier life, which they were able to cope with in the
long run, say: there was a meaning after all.
This is a remnant of the pre-scientiﬁc thinking where all events were considered
as the effects of purposeful actions of spirits, gods or demons. When we are able to
think of something as an agent, as something with a mind, we say that we
understand it. To understand someone, is, as Collingwood puts it, ‘to put oneself
in the other’s shoes’.
Should one denounce this urge for understanding of disasters and other
unpredictable events as bad thinking? My view is that it depends on which
conclusions one draws. It should be clear that calling something meaningful, in
the sense here given, has no implications for our future actions and no predictive
force. So if it has no impact in our actions and decisions, it seems innocent and
perhaps beneﬁcial for well-being (It might even function as placebo.). But if
someone allows thoughts about the meaning of natural events to guide his choices
about how to act, he runs the risk of making, from his own point of view, bad
decisions.
No one can live, I grant, without trying to ﬁnd a meaning in his/her own life. But
we should not allow this craving for meaning to interfere with our search for
reliable knowledge about laws and regularities relevant when deliberating on
which actions to take. Of course, we may make wrong inductions about which
regularities there are and hence which actions best to do. But trying to use wishes of
gods as guidance is bound to fail.

Appendix: Logical Forms
Introduction
When we disagree with other people, we discuss. If we really try to reach for
knowledge and not just to win a debate, we are faced with the question as to whether
or not an opponent’s argument should be accepted. In order to decide this we must
answer two questions: (i) do we accept the opponent’s premises, and (ii) do we
accept the reasoning, or form of the argument? If the answer to both of these
questions is ‘yes’, then one must accept the argument. If on the other hand one ﬁnds
a premise untenable, one can object in the following way: ‘I accept your form of
reasoning, but your starting point is false, and therefore I cannot accept your
conclusion’. Another possible stance is ‘I accept your premises, but the conclusions
you draw do not follow from your premises. Therefore, I cannot accept your
conclusions’.
An argument is composed of a number of premises and a conclusion. The
question about the truth of the premises of a scientiﬁc argument is an empirical
question (except in mathematics and logic); it has to do with what laws or obser-
vational statements are true. In this appendix, we shall instead concentrate our
discussion on another question, that of whether an argument is logically valid; that
is, whether one is rationally bound to accept the conclusion if one accepts the
premises.
However, before discussing this question it should be mentioned that there are
many examples of scientiﬁc arguments that do not claim to be logically valid,
namely, inductive arguments. In such cases, one does not claim that the conclusion
logically follows from the premises, but only that the conclusion is probable or
believable, given the premises. The question of what kinds of inductive arguments
we should, or should not, accept is a source of much controversy in the philosophy
of science. Popper claimed that we should never accept an inductive argument,
while most other philosophers have claimed that one can accept such arguments
under certain conditions. In particular, quite a few have claimed that one can

233

construct rules for determining what degree of credence a certain inductive
argument has. I shall not delve deeper into this issue here; rather, I shall turn
attention to other cases where the question of logical validity is relevant.
The question of whether or not an argument is logically valid is a question
about its logical form. Validity has nothing to do with the content of an argument,
i.e., what the words mean. One should also distinguish the question of whether a
conclusion is true or not from the question of whether or not an inference is valid.
A conclusion is true if the premises are true and if the inference is valid, but if any
one of the premises is false, the inference can still be valid even though the
conclusion is false.
What, then, is the logical form of an argument? To answer this question,
we begin with describing the logical form of a single sentence.
Logical Form 1: Sentences
Let us start with a simple assertion, ‘The Nile is the longest river in Africa’. This
sentence essentially consists of two parts, the subject and the predicate. ‘The Nile’
is the subject, and ‘the longest river in Africa’ is the predicate. In high school
grammar we identify the predicate with a single word, but in this context we can
forget the details and treat entire phrases as predicates. It seems natural to analyse
the meaning of the above sentence in the following way: the subject of the sentence
refers to a certain object, the Nile, and the sentence is true if and only if the Nile has
the property that the predicate ‘is the longest river in Africa’ expresses or describes.
But this simple analysis immediately runs into problems in cases where the subject
does not exist. A classic example presented by Bertrand Russell is
#1. The present king of France is bald.
One cannot say this sentence is true. Is it, then, false, or meaningless? On the one
hand, it seems completely wrong to say that the sentence is meaningless, since its
syntax is correct and we understand what the words mean. But is it false? If it is
false that the king of France is bald, then it is true that he is not bald, that is, it is true
that
#2. The present king of France has hair on his head.
But that is also totally unacceptable. So the sentence is meaningful and well
formed, but neither true nor false. Should we give up the principle of bivalence: that
every well-formed sentence is either true or false? Most would say ‘No!’
In order to solve this problem it is appropriate to introduce a distinction between
a sentence’s grammatical form and its logical form. The idea is that the logical
form so to speak lies beneath the grammatical form. We can conceive that there
exists a certain fundamental proposition with a certain logical structure, which–
through various transformations–becomes the sentences we are familiar with in
234
Appendix: Logical Forms

everyday language. In the case of the bald French king, Russell solved the problem
by proposing that #1 should be interpreted as a shortened version of the proposition
#3. There now exists one and only one king of France, and this king is bald.
This sentence consists of two separate propositions connected by conjunction
‘and’. Notice that #3 can be further reformulated in the following way:
#4. There exists an object x such that x is presently the king of France and x is bald,
and if there exists an object y such that y is presently the king of France and is
bald, then x ¼ y.
This is the logical form of #1, and as such it is quite easy to analyse. Since the
sentence is composed of three parts conjoined by two occurrences of the word
‘and’, each component must be true in order for the entire sentence to be true; and
since there is no object x that makes the ﬁrst part of the conjunction true, then the
entire sentence is false. Thus as we expected, the sentence is false, meaningful and
completely intelligible. The negation of this false sentence must be true, which is
the case, for if we negate #4, we get:
#5. There exists no object x such that x is the present king of France and x is bald.
We have thus fulﬁlled all the requirements; namely, (i) the sentence, appropri-
ately paraphrased, is meaningful, (ii) it is false and (iii) its negation is true.
There are various other semantic problems, which can be solved by this way of
analysing sentences. One such problem is the use of ‘nothing’ and other indeﬁnite
pronouns as subjects. For example, take the sentence
#6. Nothing is sacred.
In normal situations, one would say that a sentence expresses something about
what the noun phrase refers to, and if it does not refer to anything, then the sentence
is meaningless. But what does ‘nothing’ refer to? Nothing! In order to maintain the
quite reasonable idea that a meaningful assertion consists of a noun phrase and a
predicate, and that it is true only if the object to which the noun phrase refers
actually has the property that the predicate describes, then it seems that we need
to presume that the term ‘nothing’ refers to a kind of object of thought. However,
this is absurd. A simple solution presents itself if we recognize that the logical
form of #6 is
#7. There exists no object x such that x is sacred.
Hence we see how greatly variables and the quantiﬁers ‘There exists’ and ‘For
all’ help us when we try to describe and understand the semantic aspects of
language.
We have now come to a sentence’s logical form. The form of a sentence is
determined by how it is constructed by means of logical constants and variables.
Beside the already introduced constants ‘There is’, not’ and ‘and’, there are ﬁve
more, viz., ‘all’, ‘or’, ‘if. . .then’, and ‘if and only if’. These logical constants are
often symbolized in the following way:
Appendix: Logical Forms

all
8
there exists
∃
and
^ or &
or
_
not
Ø or ~
if. . .then. . .
 or !
if and only if
$
Logical constants are words whose meaning is completely context-independent.
Their meaning can be described by means of introduction and elimination rules.
Here is an example illustrating this point.
If we know that sentence A and sentence B are true, then we can introduce the
logical constant ‘and’ according to the following inference rule: (above the line are
sentences already accepted and beneath the inferred sentence):
A
B
A and B
where we have concluded that ‘A and B’ is true. (One cannot explain this rule in
words without using the word ‘and’, which is the word we want to explain. Thus
there is a point in using structural symbols to display inference forms.) Conversely,
if we know that ‘A and B’ is true, we can eliminate ‘and’ by the logical rule
A and B
A
i.e., we conclude that ‘A’ is true, from the premise that ‘A and B’ is true. Via these
two logical rules, we have clearly deﬁned how the word ‘and’ should be used
regarding its insertion in a text, or what conclusions can be drawn from a text in
which it is contained. In the same way, one can conﬁgure an introduction and
elimination rule for all seven logical constants.
Variables
The other component present in #4–#7 is the variable x. This variable functions
exactly like a variable in mathematics; that is, it assumes different values in
different concrete situations. The difference is that in mathematics variables usually
assume numbers as values, whereas logical variables assume objects.
A moment of consideration tells us that pronouns are actually a type of variable
in that they do not denote the same objects regardless of context. Instead, they refer
according to the circumstances. We can thus say, in general, that pronouns can be
replaced with variables such as x, y, or z. This is a great advantage, for
236
Appendix: Logical Forms

constructions that easily become ambiguous in everyday language can be disam-
biguated when rewritten in their logical form. Consider the following example.
#8. Carl often played tennis with Peter. Most of the time, he lost.
It is not clear whom it was that normally lost, but if we rewrite this sentence in its
logical form, the problem can easily be cleared up. The trick is to give the same
variable, e.g. x, for ‘he’ and ‘Carl’, if we in fact meant that it was Carl who lost most
of the time. Thus we get
#9. There exists an object x such that x is Carl and x often played tennis with Peter
and x lost most of the time.
Predicates
We have hitherto identiﬁed two types of sentence components: logical constants
and variables. The third component is the remainder of a sentence, the predicate. I
have already mentioned that the word ‘predicate’ denotes not only individual
verbs but also entire expressions, which we use to claim something about the object
of discussion. A predicate can be described as an incomplete sentence; start with a
complete sentence and substitute one or more expressions that describe or refer to
individual things with empty placeholders or variables. In the examples above, the
expressions ‘. . .is the present king of France’, ‘. . .is bald’ and ‘. . . often played
tennis with Peter’ are predicates. Instead of writing a dotted line to mark an empty
space we simply insert a variable, which makes it easier to express. Thus ‘x is the
present king of France’ is the same predicate as ‘. . .is the present king of France’.
We see here how convenient it is to use variables as placeholders.
One could ask oneself why one should substitute a variable for ‘Carl’ but not for
‘Peter’. The answer is, of course, that one can do so if need be. That is to say, we can
either analyse #8 as consisting one singular term ‘Carl’ and a predicate ‘. . .often
played tennis with Peter’, or as two singular terms ‘Carl’ and ‘Peter’ and the two-
place predicate ‘. . .often played tennis with. . .’. Predicates can thus have one or
more empty spaces; we can talk about one-place, two-place, three-place predicates
and so on.
Since the purpose of the above analysis is to discover the logical form of a
sentence, we are not interested in the content of a sentence. This means that we do
not care about what kind of object we are talking about; that is, the objects to which
the singular terms refer. Nor are we concerned about the properties we ascribe to
them; therefore, it is useful to replace long predicate expressions with placeholders,
just as we replace pronouns and logical words with variables and symbols, respec-
tively. The result is maximal lucidity with all informative content removed, thus
allowing us to consider the logical form in isolation. This yields a rather compact
and perspicuous notation, which simpliﬁes discussion of the form of an argument.
Appendix: Logical Forms
237

The convention is to replace predicate expressions with upper case letters. In our
example #9 above, if we put ‘x ¼ Carl’ as ‘Cx’, ‘x often played tennis with Peter’ as
‘Tx’ and ‘x lost most of the time’ as ‘Lx’ we get
#10. ∃xCx & Tx& Lx
which we read as
#11. There exists an x such that x has property C and x has property T and x has
property L.
Logical Form 2: Argument
In this appendix, we will not give a complete review of which argument forms are
valid and which are invalid; rather, we shall look at some common cases of
scientiﬁc argument forms as well as some common invalid argument forms.
Some Common Valid Argument Forms
1. Modus Ponens
Perhaps the most common of all argument forms is the following: It is the case that
if p is true, then q is true (where p and q are propositions). But we know that p is true
(p is the case, it is a fact that p, etc.). Thus it is also the case that q is true.
Using our logical symbols, we can clarify this argument in the following way:
p 
q
p
q
⊃ 
Above the solid line we have the premises of the argument, and below it follows the
conclusion. I think that everyone would agree that this is a logically valid argument
form.
2. Modus Tollens
Example If Carl had travelled to Crete, he would have taken his passport. How-
ever, Carl’s passport is still at his house. Hence Carl has not travelled to Crete.
In symbolic form, this argument becomes
p 
q
¬q
¬p
⊃
(where p ¼ Carl travelled to Crete, and q ¼ Carl took his passport).
238
Appendix: Logical Forms

I have here treated ‘Carl did not take his passport’ and ‘Carl’s passport is still at
his house’ as logically equivalent. In certain situations, such identiﬁcation may be
unacceptable. A more complete argument is the following.
If Carl has travelled Crete, then he must have taken his passport. However,
Carl’s passport is still at his house. If Carl’s passport is at home, then he has not
taken his passport with him. Thus Carl has not travelled to Crete. The form of this
more complete argument is
1. p
q
(Assumption)
2.
r
(Assumption. r=Carl’s passport is at home)
3. r
¬q
4. ¬q
5. ¬p
⊃
⊃
Note that this argument makes use of Modus Ponens in lines 2–4
3. Instantiation
In the discussion of scientiﬁc laws and explanations, we often ﬁnd arguments
that can be exempliﬁed by the following: It is a general law that green plants
produce oxygen. Now, plankton p is a green plant. Therefore, where we ﬁnd this
plankton, we should ﬁnd the production of oxygen taking place. The sentence ‘all
green plants produce oxygen’ has the logical form
For all objects x such that x is a green plant, x produces oxygen.
If we insert the symbols ‘Gx’ for ‘x is a green plant’ and ‘Px’ for ‘x produces
oxygen’, then we can formalize this argument in the following way:
x (Gx 
Px)
Ga
Pa
⊃
∀
This argument is valid. What goes for all objects of a certain kind obviously goes
for a particular object of the same kind.
Some Invalid Argument Forms
1. Conﬁrming the antecedent
Example (P1) If you are kind, then you will receive Christmas presents from Santa
Claus.
(P2) In fact, you do receive Christmas presents from Santa Claus.
C: Therefore, you have been kind.
Appendix: Logical Forms
239

This is not a logically valid inference since the ﬁrst premise does not exclude the
possibility that one can receive presents without being kind. (In fact, this has been
known to happen!) Thus, constructing a counter example is enough for proving an
argument being invalid.
The logical form of this invalid argument is:
p 
q
q
------------
p
⊃
Another example of the same mistake is the following: ‘All members of the Left
Party want to increase equality and fairness in society. Erik wants to increase
equality and fairness is society. Therefore, Erik is a member of the Left Party’.
The form of this argument is (Erik is identiﬁed as the referent of the constant a):
x (Gx 
Px)
Pa
------------------
Ga
⊃
∀
2. Implication-negation
Example (P1) If one speaks Swedish ﬂuently, then one was born and raised in
Sweden.
(P2) But Ahmed does not speak Swedish ﬂuently.
C Therefore, he was not born in Sweden.
This argument sounds pretty reasonable, especially since the person in question
has an Arabic name. However, reasonable or not, the conclusion does not follow
from the premises an it is easy to conceive of counterexamples. A study of the
logical form soon clariﬁes this point. The logical form of the premise P1 is
For all x, it is the case that if x speaks Swedish ﬂuently, then x was born and raised in
Sweden,
which in symbolic form becomes
x (Sx 
Px), 
⊃
∀
where Sx ¼ ‘x speaks Swedish ﬂuently’ and Px ¼ ‘x was born and raised in Swe-
den’. Since by assumption this is the case for all persons, it is also the case for
Ahmed, which we refer to with the letter ‘a’. It is thus also the case that
Sa 
Pa.
⊃
240
Appendix: Logical Forms

This step can probably be considered as an implicit assumption in the example
above. Thus the logical form of the example is the following:
x (Sx 
Px)
P1
Sa 
Pa
from P1
¬Sa
P2
----------------------------------
¬Pa
C
⊃
⊃
∀
If this were a logically valid inference, then all arguments with the same form
would be such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true. It is,
however, quite easy to ﬁnd a counterexample. Consider the following:
If it rains, the ground is wet.
It is not raining.
----------------------------------
The ground is not wet.
However, it is entirely possible for the ground to become wet by watering it with a
garden hose, even though it has not rained.
It is important to truly understand the ‘if. . .then’ construction, which can best done
by studying a table of truth-values. Unfortunately, in everyday language use, we use the
‘if. . .then’ construction in many different ways, which deserve a little investigation.
The ‘if. . .then’ Construction
Conditionals expressed by the ‘if. . .then’ constructions are common. An example is
‘if the disease is caused by a bacterium, then the disease is cured with penicillin’.
Such constructions can be interpreted in, at least, four different ways: (i) material
implication (also called ‘material conditional’), (ii) causal connection, (iii)
derivability or (iv) necessitation.
The interpretation of the ‘if. . .then’ construction as material implication is based
on the extensionality principle, which states that the truth-value of a compound
sentence depends only upon the truth-values of its components. (This principle can
be formulated even for the components of a sentence: a sentence’s truth-value does
not change if one substitutes one component in the sentence (e.g. a name) for
another component with the same extension/reference.) A sentence of the form
‘if A, then B’ obviously consists of two components, A and B, which are themselves
sentences. Thus if we apply the extensionality principle, the truth-value of ‘if A,
then B’ is unequivocally determined by the truth-values of A and B. Combining two
sentences into one, we get four combinations of the truth-values true (T) and false
(F). The truth-values of ‘if A, then B’ for each combination are shown in the
following table (Table A.1):
Appendix: Logical Forms
241

Note that if the antecedent is false, then the entire ‘if. . .then’ sentence is true
independent of the truth-value of the consequent. This fact shocks some people at
ﬁrst, but it is in accord with our use of conditionals. The sentence ‘if A, then B’ is
synonymous with ‘if A is true, then B is true’. So the construction ‘if. . ..then. . ..’ is
used for making a conditional statement: we assert the truth of B, conditional on the
truth of A, and consequently, if A happens to be false, we do not assert anything
about B, it could be true or false.
If we were to require that A cannot be false if B is to be true, then we would have
to say ‘B is true if and only if A is true’. It is obvious that this is a stronger
proposition than ‘if A is true, then B is true’. The sentence ‘if A, then B’ is thus
equivalent to the sentence ‘it is not the case that A is true and B is false’.
In this interpretation, we have not required that which makes A true also, in some
way or other, brings about, leads to, or causes B to be true; it sufﬁces that B in fact
is true, for whatever reasons, when A is true. According to this interpretation, the
sentence ‘if the moon is made of green cheese, then 7 + 5 ¼ 12’ is true!
If we return for a moment to the argument form implication-negation above, we can
now clearly see that it cannot be a valid argument form. If we know that the conditional
statement is true, then we can certainly eliminate the possibility that A is true and B is
false. That is to say, we can exclude the secondrow of the table. Furthermore, we know
that A is false, that is, we eliminate the ﬁrst row. However, these two pieces of
information do not allow us to conclude that B is false, as we still have two alternatives
(rows 3 and 4) left, and we do not know whether B is true or false.
Interpretations (ii), (iii) and (iv) represent stronger, non-extensional interpreta-
tions of the ‘if. . .then’ construction. These interpretations state that the truth-value
of a sentence is not only determined by the truth-values of its components; in
addition there must exist some kind of relation between the contents of the
sentences ‘A’ and ‘B’. There are at least three non-extensional interpretations of
‘if A, then B’;
(a)
causal connection: A causes B
(b)
logical connection: B is derivable from A
(c)
modal connection: A necessitates B
(a)
Sometimes the most reasonable interpretation of the ‘if. . .then’-construction is
that it expresses a causal connection, as in the following sentence: ‘if one steps
on the gas pedal, the car accelerates’. It is reasonable to interpret such a
proposition as if the speaker is taking for granted that there is a causal
connection involved, which is so well known that it needs not be explicitly
stated.

(b)
One
can
sometimes
interpret
the
‘if. . .then’-construction
as
logical
derivability as in the following example: ‘If all swans are white, then a bird
that is not white cannot be swan’. A formal proof is hardly necessary in this
case, for everyone can see that the consequence logically follows from the
antecedent. Another example is ‘if a triangle equilateral, then each of its angles
is 60’. It is easy to see that it is possible to prove the consequence, given the
antecedent and the axioms of Euclidian geometry.
(c)
The sentence ‘if John Doe is a bachelor, then he is an unmarried male’ is not a
logical truth, but we might think that it is necessarily true. But what does it
mean to say that a sentence is not merely true, but necessarily true? In this
particular case, it appears reasonable to say it is necessarily true on the basis of
the deﬁnition of a bachelor. However, the obvious objection is that such a
deﬁnition depends on an established language, which is to say that we usually
understand ‘bachelor’ and ‘unmarried male’ as being synonymous. This is an
historical fact about our language use, and as such is hardly a necessary truth.
But then how can a consequence of an historical fact be a necessary truth?
It is not easy to say what it meant by a sentence being necessarily true, if what is
meant is something beyond logical truth. The common view nowadays is to explain
the meaning of ‘p is necessarily true’ as that the proposition p is true in all possible
worlds that are accessible from our world. This can be formalized so as to satisfy
high demands on stringency. But empiricists are not satisﬁed; fulﬁlling formal truth
conditions is one thing, but as an explanation of the meaning of ‘necessary’ it is not
satisfying; if one wonder about ‘necessary’ it is hardly a step forward to explain this
concept using ‘possible worlds’ and ‘accessibility’; if anything this makes things
worse. (But all accept, even empiricists, that the formal semantics in terms of
possible worlds shows that talk about necessary truths can be made consistent.)
According to Quine, who has been the staunchest critic of modal talk, there are
no other necessary truths than logical truths. Many have protested, arguing that, for
example, natural laws as necessary truths that are not logical truths. This is indeed a
controversial question, and for my part I have suggested an explanation of the
necessity of some natural laws that even a strong critic of modal talk like Quine
plausibly would accept (see Sect. 10.7). In any case, the fact remains that a
conditional of the form of an ‘if. . .then’ sentence is sometimes intended to be
interpreted as a necessary truth. Those who claim such an interpretation to be
correct are required to explain what they mean by ‘necessity’.
According to an inﬂuential view, ﬁrst proposed by Kripke, there really are truths
that are metaphysically necessary, such as some identities. This topic is however
beyond the scope of this short appendix.
Appendix: Logical Forms
243

Necessary and Sufﬁcient Conditions
The expressions ‘necessary condition’ and ‘sufﬁcient condition’ or their synonyms,
are often used. These should not be interpreted any stronger than as variations of the
material conditional. In other words, ‘A is a sufﬁcient condition for B’ means ‘If A,
then B.’ and’ ‘A is a necessary condition for B’ means, ‘If B, then A.’. Despite
surface appearance, there are no modal commitments in using the term ‘necessary
condition’.

Deﬁnitions of Some Core Concepts
(N.B. Some of these deﬁnitions are highly controversial and some are my own
inventions. The reader is urged not to view these deﬁnitions as generally agreed
upon among philosophers.)
Ad hoc-hypothesis
An auxiliary assumption which (i) is introduced only
for saving the tested hypothesis from refutation, and
(ii) which do not allow of independent testing.
Analytic sentence
A sentence is analytic if and only if its truth-value
only depends on the meaning of its words.
Auxiliary assumption
A statement that (i) is necessary in order to infer an
empirical implication from a hypothesis, and which
(ii) is not tested in the given situation, but is rather
assumed to be true.
Brute fact-social fact
A brute fact is a fact whose existence does not
depend on human thoughts, attitudes or knowledge,
whereas the existence of social facts does depend on
these things.
Conditional Probability
P(A|B) ¼ P(AB)/P(B)
Corroboration
(Popper’s concept)
An hypothesis is corroborated if and only if has
survived attempts to falsify it.
Deduction:
A form of reasoning that is truth-preserving: if the
premises in a deductive argument is true, then the
conclusion is true.
Empirical Consequence:
A statement that (i) follows from the hypothesis and
eventual auxiliary assumptions, and (ii) whose truth,
under plausible circumstances, can be determined by
observation.

sentence ‘if B, then A’ is true.
Occasion sentence
A ‘here-and-now-sentence’ i.e., a sentence

present and who understands the speaker’s language
immediately can agree on what is said, no matter
differences in culture and theoretical beliefs.

An event or state of affairs is ontologically subjective
if it occurs in an individual person’s mind, otherwise
ontologically objective.
Propositional knowledge:
Justiﬁed, true belief.
