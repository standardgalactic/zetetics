Appendix 1
On the Completeness of a Syllogistic without Logical
Conjunction
(To § 40)
The elementary conjunction represented by ‘(. . ., . . .)’ – also called a conjunction
of premises above – does not belong to the logical vocabulary which is needed to
present the elementary syllogistic in Parts I and II of this essay. In what follows, I
will call the language which contains only this logical vocabulary and which I
have called the ‘elementary language of the syllogistic’ at the end of § 15, ‘lan-
guage 1’. I will distinguish from this language a ‘language 2’ whose vocabulary
contains not only the logical vocabulary of language 1 but in addition the logical
constant ‘(. . ., . . .)’. Finally, we can think of a third language which relates to lan-
guage 2 just like language 1 relates to language 2, because it differs from the latter
just by the fact that the logical constant ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ does not occur in it. I call this
language ‘language 3’.
We should compare languages 1 and 3 with respect to their capability. For
this one needs the superordinate language 2. For only in this language can rules
be formulated so that expressions of language 1 can be put into a logical relation
with expressions of language 3 and compared with each other. The expressions
that matter for the desired comparison are of course expressions of the basic
rules which can only be rendered in the languages we are comparing. Concerning
language 1, the basic rules which belong to it are first of all those I introduced
above in §§ 44 and 48. As for the capability of language 1, we must ask whether
there are for the hypothetical expressions which occur in the basic rules of hypo-
thetical inference expressions of language 3 of the same logical strength; and con-
versely: whether there is for every expression of language 3 an expression of the
same logical strength in language 1. By expressions of the same logical strength I
mean just those expressions for which there are rules in language 2 according to
which the one expression is derivable from the other, and conversely. We can say
that the capabilities of languages 1 and 3 are equally great (in a certain respect) if
there is for every expression in one language an expression in the other with the
same logical strength.
The question which must now be posed is: what are the valid rules which put
expressions of languages 1 and 3 in a logical relation that can be formulated in lan-
guage 2? To be able to answer this question, we must go back to the definitions
from which result each of the basic rules that hold for the expressions of the lan-
guages we are comparing. These are the definitions of the hypothetical proposition
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-013

and of the conjunction of premises. According to the definition in § 47, a hypotheti-
cal proposition of the form H (A, B) is true if and only if B follows regularly from A;
and according to the definition of regular consequence in § 43, B follows regularly
from A if and only if A and C, with C = N B and B = N C, are incompatible. Now the
incompatibility of two propositions A and C can be immediately defined as a rela-
tion which obtains if and only if NM (A, C) is true (see Appendix 4 below). From this
it results that besides the basic rules of § 48, both of the following rules hold as well
and can be formulated in language 2:
H (A, B) : : NM (A, N B),
(2. 1)
H (A, N B) : : NM (A, B).
(2. 2)
By contrast, no rule which could be rendered in language 2 and in which a logical
relation to the form of hypothetical propositions would be expressed, could be
based directly on the definition of the conjunction of premises which I established
in § 30. For according to this definition, the meaning of a conjunction of premises
‘(. . ., . . .)’
is fixed such that for every interpretation in which A and B are true or false prop-
ositions, it holds that:
(1) (A, B) is true if A and B are both true or N (A, B) is false; and (2) (A, B) is false if it is
possible that A or B is false and thus that N A or N B is true.
From this definition, no logical relation to the form of hypothetical propositions
directly results. Rather, only the following three basic rules (belonging to lan-
guage 3) can be directly based on this definition:
A, B ∴(A, B),
(3. 1)
B, A ∴(A, B),
(3. 2)
NN (A, B) ∴(A, B).
(3. 3)
Now, it can be shown on the basis of the rules (2. 1), (2. 2), and (3. 1) that for cer-
tain expressions of the form H (A, B), there is a certain expression of the same
logical strength in language 3, and conversely for a certain expression of the form
(A, B) there is a certain expression of the same logical strength in language 1 as
well. That is, two further rules hold in language 2:
H (A, B) : : N (A, C) (with C = N B or B = N C),
(2. 3)
(A, B) : : NH (A, C) (with C = N B or B = N C).

To prove the validity of both these rules, one must provide separate proofs for
the sub-rules they contain. Here, first, are the proofs for the four sub-rules which
are summarized by (2. 3):
H (A, B) ∴N (A, N B)

Likewise, the four sub-rules which are summarized in (2. 4) can be proved. For
this it is necessary to assume the validity of the rules (2. 3. 1 to (2. 3. 4):

These eight proofs show, first, that every negated and non-negated expression of the
form H (A, B) from language 1 (with arbitrary substitutions for A and B) is replace-
able by an equivalent expression from language 3, and, second, that conversely
every negated and non-negated expression of the form (A, B) from language 3 (with
arbitrary substitutions for A and B) is replaceable by an equivalent expression from
language 1 as well. Because of the equivalence of these expressions, one may also
assume with Alexander of Aphrodisias that they can be translated into one another
without loss of meaning, so that, e.g., ‘H (A, B)’ and ‘N (A, N B)’ are equivalent to ‘A is
incompatible with N B’.238
However, this cannot mean that languages 1 and 3 are entirely substitutable
for each other. The logical vocabulary that is needed for a given logical system,
such as the syllogistic, depends decisively on the language which is used for the
establishment of its basic rules. Such rules include not only inference forms from
which other inference forms are to be derived and which themselves do not need

any derivation, since they (like, e.g., modus ponendo ponens) are valid on the
basis of the meaning of the logical vocabulary which is used in them. The basic
rules also include the metalogical rules according to which forms of inference are
derived from other forms of inference.
It can be seen from the proofs of the validity of the eight rules (2. 3. 1) to (2. 4. 4)
in language 2 that there is no metalogical rule from language 3 which would be ap-
plied here, but there is one from language 1, namely the principle of conditionaliza-
tion (II. 1). As one can see, the proofs for the validity of (2. 3. 2) and (2. 3. 4) depend
on this principle, and those for (2. 4. 2) and (2. 4. 4) depend on it indirectly. This
principle is needed here to transform the form of an inference from two premises
into a form in which one of the two premises becomes the antecedent of a hypo-
thetical conclusion. This principle is generally valid because the regular consequence
of a conclusion B from one of several premises, A, means the same as H (A, B)
(see § 48). Since all logical consequence is regular consequence, this principle can
be used in general to derive modes of inference from other modes of inference.
However, unlike ‘H (. . ., . . .)’, the expression ‘(. . ., . . .)’ is incapable of ren-
dering the existence of a consequence relation which must occur in every form of
inference from which another form of inference is derived. For this reason, lan-
guage 3 contains no expression with which the metalogical rule for deriving infer-
ence forms from other inference forms can be established. And from this it
results that, concerning the logical vocabulary for the basic rules of the elemen-
tary syllogistic, language 1 can be replaced only partially, but not completely by
language 3. Yet in the opposite direction a complete substitution is possible, as is
demonstrated by the use of language 2 described in this Appendix.
