Chapter 1 
 
Introduction 
 
 
1.1. Aim and scope of the work 
 
This is a book on conditionals based on the study of linguistic corpora. The principles that have shaped the 
book are that it should be essentially data-driven, that it should be comprehensive in terms of the facets of 
conditionals which it addresses, and that it should be usable as a reference work on conditionals. To achieve 
the latter goal, there is an extensive glossary and a detailed index. (The presence of the glossary renders it 
possible to read most of the chapters in isolation. The reader may therefore skip chapters on a particular 
subject, e.g. the chapter on the use of tenses, if he feels like doing so.) 
We started the work by analysing a small initial corpus. On the basis of this, a preliminary description of 
conditionals was set out, which was then tested against very many more examples, drawn from various 
sources, including, principally, the Cobuild and LOB corpora. In the process, it became clear to us (a) that 
more distinctions are required to describe the type of possible world (e.g. ‘open’, ‘counterfactual’...) that is 
referred to in a conditional than we (and other authors on the subject) had assumed to be necessary, (b) that 
conditional clauses seem to have many more semantic and pragmatic functions than has hitherto been evident 
from the literature, and (c) that a comprehensive description of a conditional utterance requires reference to a 
considerable number of criteria by which it may differ from other conditional utterances, not just the one or 
two parameters (for example the possible-world parameter, with or without a discussion of tense) to which 
works on conditionals so far tend to confine themselves. 
The reason why we undertook the writing of this book was the fact that the literature on conditionals, vast 
as it may be, did not provide an answer to many of the questions that cropped up once we had taken an 
interest in conditionals. In the following subsections we give some illustrative examples of this. 
 
1.1.1. ‘Factual’ versus ‘closed’ conditions 
 
Some authors refer to, or hint at, a category of possible worlds which we call ‘factual’; others distinguish, or 
hint at, a category which we call ‘closed’. None recognizes both. “Factual” and “closed” are apparently used 
for the same phenomenon, viz. that the condition referred to in a conditional clause may be treated as 
fulfilled. However, this seemingly unitary phenomenon actually covers two possibilities, so that we need two 
different terms with different meanings. In this book we will use the terms ‘factual’ and ‘closed’ and 
distinguish between the two of them as follows. A condition is ‘factual’ if it is known by the speaker (or the 
omniscient author) to be fulfilled; it is ‘closed’ if it is assumed to be fulfilled on the basis of another 
speaker’s authority. The need for this distinction is clear from (1a-d): 
(1)  
a. 
[“Mummy, the milkman’s here.”] — “If the milkman’s here, give him his money.” 
 
 
b. 
(context: the speaker sees the milkman at the door)  *If the milkman’s here, give him his money. 
 
 
c. 
[“Mummy, the milkman’s here.”] — “If the milkman’s here, I can give him his money.” 
 
 
d. 
(context: the speaker sees the milkman at the door and says to herself:)  If the milkman’s here, I can 
give him his money. 
In (1b) and (1d), the condition expressed concerns the actual world: on the basis of direct and personal 
observation, the speaker knows for a fact that the milkman is there. In (1a) and (1c) the speaker does not 
know that the milkman is there, but assumes he is, on the basis of someone else’s authority. In chapter 4 we 
will call these two types of suppositions / conditions ‘factual’ and ‘closed’, respectively. The unacceptability 
of (1b) is due to the fact that a speaker cannot process a fact as a supposition, except in ‘inferential’ 
conditionals, i.e. in conditionals expressing a conclusion Q that is drawn from a premise P. (1b) is not an 
inferential conditional. By contrast, sentence (1a) presents no problem because it refers to a closed condition; 
(1c), which is inferential, does not present any problem for the same reason; (1d), which is also inferential, is 
acceptable in spite of the fact that the condition would seem to be factual. The reason is that the condition is 
really treated as closed. In closed inferential conditionals, the if-clause is ‘nonfactual’. It is not important 
whether the proposition expressed by it is true in the actual world or not; what matters is that that proposition 

is assumed to be true for the sake of the argument—see section 4.1.5 below. In other words, the fact that (1d) 
is to be interpreted as inferential means that the speaker treats the if-clause as making a closed supposition. 
This explains the acceptability of (1d). In sum, (1a-d) illustrate the need for recognizing the existence of, and 
the difference between, factual and closed conditions. To our knowledge, this distinction is not to be found in 
the existing literature. (In fact, the two are often equated with each other or mixed up—see, for example, 
Dancygier & Mioduszewska [1984: 127-128], who use “factual” in our sense of ‘closed-P’.) 
 
1.1.2. Pseudo-Q conditionals 
 
‘Pseudo-Q conditionals’ is the term we will use to refer to conditionals in which the overt head clause (Q-
clause) is not really the Q-clause of the ‘If P, Q’ conditional. The real Q-clause is covert; the overt clause 
accompanying the conditional clause gives the reason for what is expressed in the actual conditional. For 
example: 
(2)  
[She’s got the best motive of any of them, and she’d probably have the nerve as well.] But she couldn’t have 
planned it all, surely, even if somehow she had the opportunity <to commit the murder> that night, [say, after 
she got back from Stratford].  (DOC) 
What is going on here is that the speaker is going through a check-list of what would be required to make a 
good suspect (viz. motive, means, opportunity). She comes to the conclusion that the referent of she would 
not make a good suspect, even if she had had the opportunity (which is hardly likely), because she could not 
have planned it all. So the message conveyed in the even if-conditional is: “The view that she’s not a good 
suspect wouldn’t be undermined (precluded) by it transpiring (which is unlikely) that she had the 
opportunity, because she couldn’t have planned it all.” That is, the ‘even if’ relation holds between the 
implicit Q-clause (which we can call Q1) she isn’t a good suspect and the P-clause she had the opportunity. 
The apparent Q-clause, she couldn’t have planned it all, surely (which we can call Q2), is not the actual Q-
clause but gives an explanation for the assertion of ‘Q1 even if P’. We can read (2) as: “But she couldn’t 
have planned it all, surely, so she’s (still) not a good suspect, even if somehow she had the opportunity.” 
The following is a similar example: 
(3)  
[“There may be another power-cut tonight.” — “Don’t worry.] If the lights go out, I have candles in this 
cupboard.”  (=‘If the lights go out, that won’t be a problem because I have candles in this cupboard.’) 
Since both (2) and (3) are instances of ellipsis (of the ‘implicit’ Q-clause), they show that syntax is a very 
important parameter, which has not received sufficient attention in the literature. A sentence like (3) has 
wrongly been treated as a “relevance conditional” (speech act conditional, pragmatic conditional), i.e. as 
belonging to the same class as If you are thirsty, there’s some beer in the cellar (in which the if-clause 
specifies a/the condition under which the content of the head clause is expected to be relevant or informative 
to the addressee). In fact, (3) is a quite normal ‘purely case-specifying conditional’ (see section 3.8.1), that is, 
it belongs to the same class as The scheme is unworkable if you put it to the test, which no one would think of 
analysing as a relevance conditional. 
 
1.1.3. Categorizations 
 
The literature contains many attempts at offering an illuminating typology of conditionals. However, all 
these attempts have at best been only partially successful, because what we should be looking for is not a 
typology but a number of typologies. The reason is that there are so many different parameters to be taken 
into account. These naturally lead to a number of categorizations, so that a conditional always belongs to 
several categories (types) at once. Thus, the sentence If Alan didn’t do his work properly he may get into 
trouble simultaneously fits into at least half a dozen of the categories that we will distinguish. To mention 
only three of them: (a) it is an ‘inferential’ conditional, i.e. the if-clause expresses the premise leading to the 
conclusion expressed by the head clause; (b) the if-clause can be interpreted as expressing either an ‘open’ 
condition (i.e. a condition which the speaker thinks may or may not be fulfilled) or a ‘closed’ condition (i.e. a 
condition which the speaker assumes to be fulfilled); (c) the sentence is an example of a ‘syntactically 
unmarked’ conditional. 
None of the available categorizations in the literature takes more than a couple of parameters into 
account. For example, Sweetser’s (1990) influential typology distinguishes only between “content 

conditionals”, “epistemic conditionals” and “speech-act conditionals”.1 A “content conditional” is a 
conditional like If it rains, they’ll cancel the tennis match, where the situations referred to in the two clauses 
are in a conditional relationship with each other. An “epistemic conditional” draws a conclusion from a 
premise (=what we call an ‘inferential conditional’). A “speech-act conditional” is one “where the protasis is 
a supposed condition for the performance of the speech act in the apodosis” (p. 124). An example of this is If 
you’re busy, I can come back later, which means ‘If you’re busy, then I offer to return later’.2 Harder (1996) 
makes a similar distinction but uses partly different labels: “trigger conditionals”, “epistemic sequence 
conditionals” and “speech act conditionals”. 
Leech (1971) and Dancygier & Mioduszewska (1984) base their classification on a totally different 
parameter, viz. the kind of ‘possible world’ that is called up by the if-clause. A possible world is “a way 
things might be, one of which is the way things actually are, the actual world” (Jackson 1991: 4). This 
parameter leads Leech and Dancygier & Mioduszewska to distinguish between “factual”, “theoretical” and 
“hypothetical” conditionals. (However, none of these terms has the same meaning as in our analysis. In fact, 
we have decided to discard the term ‘hypothetical’ altogether, because it is used in too many different senses 
in the literature—see section 1.4.6 below.) 
Recently, Athanasiadou & Dirven (1996) have proposed another, fairly detailed, classification of 
conditionals, assigning all conditionals to one of the following three major categories: “Course of events 
conditionals”, “Hypothetical conditionals” and “Pragmatic conditionals”. In “Course of Events conditionals” 
the two situations are in a simple relation of co-occurrence (with factual meaning), e.g. If she goes, I go. 
“Hypothetical conditionals” show a causal dependency relation: if P happens, Q will follow. If neither of 
these relations is expressed, the conditional is a “Pragmatic” one. In our opinion, this threefold classification 
raises at least two problems. To begin with, if we must assume that ‘pragmatic’ covers all cases where the P 
and Q situations are not in a simple relation of co-occurrence (=course of events), or in a dependency relation 
where if P happens, Q will follow (=hypothetical), then within the ‘pragmatic’ class we find a great variety 
of examples, like the following (which do not form an exhaustive list of types): 
(4)  
a. 
If you think your bike is bad, you should try mine! 
 
 
b. 
If you’re looking for Tom, he’s in the shed. 
 
 
c. 
That’s a lovely tie, if you don’t mind me saying so. 
 
 
d. 
If the truth be told, she really didn’t want to go to the play. 
 
 
e. 
If that was a high day for rugby, it was also an important day for athletics. 
Clearly these are neither of the generalization type that Athanasiadou & Dirven classify as “course of events 
conditionals”, nor the broadly causal relationship that they classify as “hypothetical”—their test for the latter 
meaning, viz. substitutability of because for if, is not applicable to (4a-e). This means that (4a-e) must all be 
“pragmatic conditionals”. But then this is a very heterogeneous category indeed. (In chapter 10 we will show 
that ‘rhetorical conditionals’, as we will call them, comprise over twenty clearly distinguishable 
subcategories.) 
Our second criticism of Athanasiadou and Dirven’s classes is that they form a mixed bag, since one 
parameter (possible world—or perhaps dependency) distinguishes the first from the second category and 
another parameter (discourse function? level of language use?) distinguishes the third from the first two. This 
is rather like saying that in English grammar we have verbs, adjectives, subjects and objects. 
                                              
1. 
It has to be acknowledged, though, that Sweetser explicitly states (p. 113) that she does not set out to give an 
authoritative account of conditionals, but simply to illustrate the applicability of her framework based on what she 
calls “our three-way understanding of utterances as content, epistemic entity, and speech act” (p. 76). Sweetser’s 
typology will not be further discussed in this book because our discussion of the discourse functions of conditional 
clauses is complementary to her ‘functional’ approach, and it would add nothing to Sweetser’s description if we 
classified each of our functional categories additionally in terms of hers. 
2. 
This threefold distinction is based on different parameters, which are not always applied consistently. In the last 
example, “speech act” means ‘communicative function’, i.e. Searle’s (1969) “perlocutionary act”. In some of 
Sweetser’s other examples, “speech act” has the meaning of what Searle (1969) calls “illocutionary act” (i.e. 
question, directive, assertion, wish). (It should be noted that ‘illocutionary’ and ‘perlocutionary’ are often also 
used in other senses. This is not the place, however, to discuss these terminological issues.) 

The same criticism—that a single classification is built on the basis of different kinds of parameters—
applies to many other attempts that are to be found in the literature. To adduce just one more illustration, 
Palmer’s (1974: 142-3) classification of conditionals relies on the following (quite disparate) criteria: (a) 
sometimes the speaker “predicts that if one event takes place, another will follow”; (b) a conditional may 
have “a meaning close to whenever—to link two habitual actions”; (c) some conditionals represent “the truth 
of the one clause [as] following from the truth of the other”, and (d) “the if clause may do no more than 
indicate the conditions under which the main clause has any relevance or news value.” 
In sections 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 we have given three illustrations of what we consider to be gaps or deficiencies in 
the existing literature on conditionals. These illustrations reveal the need for a detailed analysis of 
conditionals in which these (and similar) problems are dealt with satisfactorily. The present book is an 
attempt at such an analysis. Its main objectives are (a) to present detailed and consistent typologies of 
conditionals based on a large number of different parameters, (b) to propose transparent and consistent labels 
for the ensuing types and subtypes (thus clearing up the terminological confusion that pervades the linguistic 
and philosophical literature on conditionals), (c) to provide a detailed analysis of these many types and 
subtypes, (d) to offer, wherever possible, explanations for the characteristics of, and the constraints on these 
types, and (e) to provide an answer to some well-known theoretical questions raised by conditionals (e.g. 
When is a condition treated as a sufficient and/or necessary condition for the consequent?). 
 
1.2. The structure of the book 
 
After this introduction (chapter 1) two chapters introduce, respectively, conditional connectives (chapter 2) 
and preliminary terminology (chapter 3). The book then takes the reader through a discussion of conditional 
sentences from the point of view of their classification according to the possible worlds they can refer to 
(chapter 4), followed by an examination of the tense patterns compatible with reference to each of these 
possible worlds (chapter 5) and a survey of the modal and subjunctive forms found in conditional sentences 
(chapter 6). There follows, in chapter 7, a critical discussion of a prototypical ‘three-type’ classification of 
conditionals (illustrated by I’ll be happy if she comes, I’d be happy if she came, and I’d have been happy if 
she’d come), in which each of three tense patterns tends to be linked with one of three possible worlds (or, to 
simplify somewhat, one of three degrees of likelihood) referred to by the conditional. To round off the 
discussion of possible worlds, chapter 8 looks at the conclusions that can be drawn from a conditional of any 
given possible-world type about the actual world. (For example, it is usually said that a conditional such as If 
I had been there I would have told him what I thought of him is counterfactual and permits the conclusion 
that the situations described in both clauses do not hold in the actual world. This is a claim which turns out to 
require considerable modification.) Chapters 9 and 10 represent a detailed examination of conditionals from 
a completely different perspective, that of the function served by conditional clauses in discourse. 
Conditionals are divided into those where we can really talk of Q applying in the case that P obtains, and 
those in which such a dependency relation is harder to detect. We speak of ‘case-specifying’ and ‘rhetorical’ 
conditionals, respectively. In the latter case, we find that the P-clause is either the starting point for a 
functionally equal and independent Q-clause (e.g. If he’s not rich, he’s hardly short of money) or provides 
some sort of comment on, amendment to, or explanation of an (often functionally independent) Q-clause 
(e.g. The murder, if there was a murder, must have been committed on Tuesday), or a comment on the 
utterance of that Q-clause (e.g. If she were brutally honest, she didn’t really like her husband much), etc. 
The next two chapters address, respectively, the syntax of conditionals, and a particular semantic issue. 
Chapter 11 surveys the very many syntactic forms that a conditional sentence can take, and the relationships 
between forms and meanings, particularly with reference to the various types of conditionals proposed in 
chapters 9 (case-specifying conditionals) and 10 (rhetorical conditionals). Chapter 12 takes a fresh look at a 
question that has been asked especially by philosophers: when is the validity of the conditional clause a 
sufficient and/or necessary condition for the validity of the main clause? Leaving aside a strictly logical 
truth-conditional analysis, we approach this question from the point of view of interpretation and explain 
how the question takes different forms (and requires different types of answers) depending partly upon the 
function of the conditional clause, as discussed in chapters 9 and 10, and partly on the application of 
pragmatic principles of conversation. 
There follow two chapters in which we investigate two conditional connectors in detail. Chapter 13 deals 
with the meanings, interpretations and uses of unless, while chapter 14 focuses on even if. 

The final chapter—chapter 15—consists of an extensive glossary in which we define and illustrate the 
(very numerous) technical terms that are used in the book. This glossary has a double purpose. First, it allows 
the reader to look up the definition of any term that was mentioned earlier in the text but whose meaning may 
have slipped his mind. (In order to be unequivocal about the many distinctions we make, and in order to be 
able to refer back to conditionals with very specific characteristics, we have had to use many labels and other 
terminology which may be new to the reader. The glossary can be used as an aid to memory, especially when 
a term must, of necessity, be introduced at one stage, and not re-used until considerably later in the book.) 
Secondly, it renders the book usable as a comprehensive reference work on conditionals. (The detailed index 
at the end forms a further contribution to this.) 
 
1.3. Terminological preliminaries 
 
1.3.1. The definition of ‘conditional (sentence)’ 
 
While working our way through innumerable examples it became clear to us that it is extremely difficult, if 
not impossible, to give a precise definition of ‘conditional’ meaning or ‘conditional interpretation’. The 
number of criteria that can be used to categorize conditionals and the number of ensuing types and subtypes 
is so large that we have found it impossible to identify a genuine common denominator. (This accords with 
Wierzbicka’s [1997: 54] claim that “the meaning of the English word condition is semantically more 
complex than that of [the lexical primitive] IF.”) Even the widely accepted view that a conditional clause is a 
subordinate clause, and hence syntactically and semantically dependent on a ‘head clause’, is not very 
helpful. For one thing, there are paratactic conditionals like Do it and/or I’ll beat you. For another, the sort of 
semantic dependency of an if-clause on its head clause may vary greatly, as can be seen from the following 
examples: 
(5)  
a. 
If you hit me, I’ll hit back.  (The actualization of the P-situation will trigger the actualization of the Q-
situation.) 
 
 
b. 
If you’re interested, there’s someone peering at your house.  (The P-clause expresses a relevance 
condition for uttering the Q-clause.) 
 
 
c. 
If my room is a bit messy, yours is a real pigsty.  (Both clauses express a fact; the Q-clause boosts the 
meaning of the P-clause: the Q-situation is even worse than the P-situation.) 
 
 
d. 
If this is Brussels, it must be Tuesday.  (=‘If P is true, Q is true.’) 
 
 
e. 
If that witness is speaking the truth, I’m the next President of the U.S.  (The hearer is invited to 
conclude from the evident falsity of Q that P must also be false.) 
Faced with these problems, we have decided to adopt a very broad definition of ‘conditional (sentence)’, 
which corresponds with the way the term is intuitively used by most linguists: a conditional is a two-clause 
structure in which one of the clauses is introduced by if or a word or phrase that has a meaning similar to if, 
only if (e.g. provided) or except if (viz. unless). The only two-clause structures with if that we do not treat as 
conditionals are those in which the subordinate clause is introduced by as if, or is a subject or object clause 
introduced by if (which is then equivalent to whether). Thus, the following are not treated as conditionals: 
(6)  
He works as if his life depended on it. 
(7)  
a. 
I don’t know if he really did it on purpose. 
 
 
b. 
If he really did it on purpose is still unknown. 
 
 
c. 
The group of senior scientists ... recommends if and when people should go forward.  (COB-S) 
By contrast, sentences like the following will be included in the discussion, even though some people might 
not accept that the if-clause has a true conditional meaning: 
(8)  
a. 
If he’s not intelligent, at least he’s reliable. 
 
 
b. 
There will be few people present, if (there are) any at all. 
 
 
c. 
There are things you just can’t say in public, if you know what I mean? 
 
1.3.2. The terms ‘situation’ and ‘actualize’ 
 
In this book we will use ‘situation’ as a cover term for the various possible types of contents of propositions, 
i.e. as a cover term for anything that can be expressed in a clause (i.e. an action, event, process, state—see 
Lyons 1977). The verb ‘actualize’ will be used as a cover term for the predicates that are typically associated 

with one of these categories. Thus, if we wish to avoid having to specify whether a clause expresses the 
performance of an action, the happening of an event, the development of a process or the existence of a state, 
we can say that the clause in question expresses the actualization of a situation. In this way it is easy to make 
generalizations about (kinds of) clauses. 
 
1.3.3. ‘P-clause’ and ‘Q-clause’ 
 
Thinking of the logical representation ‘If P, (then) Q’, we can refer to the conditional clause as the ‘P-clause’ 
and to the head clause (whether it is itself syntactically subordinate or independent) as the ‘Q-clause’. The 
situation expressed in these clauses will be called the ‘P-situation’ and the ‘Q-situation’. ‘P’ and ‘Q’ will be 
used to refer to the propositions expressed in the P-clause and the Q-clause. 
In this book we will avoid using the terms ‘protasis’ (or ‘antecedent’) and ‘apodosis’ (or ‘consequent’) 
because they seem to us really appropriate for ‘inferential’ (epistemic) conditionals only. As we will see, 
there are many other types of conditionals, though they are often disregarded (especially in the philosophical 
literature). 
 
1.3.4. P versus [+p] or [-p]; Q versus [+q] and [-q] 
 
Because both the P-clause and the Q-clause may be positive or negative, we shall refer to the two 
propositions as ‘P’ and ‘Q’, rather than ‘p’ and ‘q’. This allows us to refer to affirmative propositions as [+p] 
and [+q], and to negative propositions as [-p] and [-q]. The symbols P and Q then stand for a proposition 
which is ultimately expressed by a tensed modalized clause, with a positive or negative polarity value. In 
other words, P may be [+p] (=a positive P-proposition) or [-p] (=a negative P-proposition). Q may similarly 
be either [+q] or [-q]. This means that a negation in the P-clause or Q-clause is simply seen as part of the 
proposition P or Q. Thus, ‘if P, Q’ covers the following possibilities: 
 
If [+p], [+q]: If she was with me, I was happy. 
 
If [+p], [-q]: If she was with me, I didn’t feel at ease. 
 
If [-p], [+q]: If she wasn’t with me, I felt unhappy. 
 
If [-p], [-q]: If she wasn’t with me, I didn’t feel happy. 
Two things are worth noting here. Firstly, as is clear from the paraphrase ‘if P, Q’, if does not form part of 
the proposition P. Thus, in I was happy if she was with me, the clause expressing P is not if she was with me 
but she was with me. This is logical, since only the latter has a truth value. If she was with me resembles a 
(nonrhetorical) question in that it does not have a truth value; it is therefore not a proposition. This accords 
with Dudman (1991: 214), where it is pointed out that P-clauses referring to the future (as in If she comes, 
I’ll be happy) are neither true nor false. Still, they have a potential truth value—P will eventually turn out to 
be either true or false—so that it is justifiable to treat she comes too as the linguistic expression of a 
proposition P. (The same is true of the proposition Q.) Secondly, the practice of seeing P as being either [+p] 
or [-p] and Q as either [+q] or [-q] is in keeping with the fact that the use of not in the P-clause or Q-clause is 
normally interpreted as wide scope negation of p or q. In that case not does not negate the relation (e.g. 
inference) between p and q. Thus, both If she’s there, he {can’t be / isn’t} happy and He {can’t be / isn’t} 
happy if she’s there are interpreted as ‘[+p] leads us to infer [-q].’ These sentences are therefore examples of 
‘conditioned denials’, i.e. denials of q under condition P. There are, however a couple of exceptions to this 
general rule (according to which a negation in the P-clause or Q-clause is normally interpreted as wide scope 
negation of p or q). Firstly, a (not lexically incorporated) negator in a P-clause or Q-clause may effect 
‘constituent negation’. In that case it only has narrow scope over a particular constituent of the clause, which 
is therefore automatically interpreted ‘specificationally’,3 and hence contrastively: 
(9)  
It won’t make her HAPPY if you visit her—it’ll just make her SAD.  (=If you visit her, it’ll make her [not 
happy but sad]. The same idea would be expressed by the cleft ‘If you visit her, it’s not happy that you’ll 
make her but sad.’) 
                                              
3. 
A sentence is ‘specificational’ if it is a focusing sentence specifying a ‘value’ for a ‘variable’, as in It was John 
who did it and JOHN did it, where ‘the x who did it’ and John represent the variable and the value, respectively. 
For a more detailed discussion, see section 3.14 and especially section 11.14. 

Such sentences too are ‘conditioned denials’: the negation in the Q-clause denies a constituent of [+q] under 
condition P. 
Secondly, not can also be used in the Q-clause in order to effect ‘metalinguistic’ or ‘external’ negation, 
i.e. to reject the truth or validity of the conditional as a whole. In that case the conditional is typically echoic, 
and the negation in the Q-clause denies a statement to the contrary: 
(10)  
a. 
[“Kim will be happy if you visit her.”] — “She’ll NOT be happy if I visit her. [She hates my guts.]”  
(=It’s not true that she’ll be happy if I visit her) (=NOT ‘if [+p], then [+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
[“You’ll probably be happy if she comes again?”] — “Oh no, I WON’T be happy if she comes; [I don’t 
like her at all.]” 
In these examples, not has scope over the entire conditional and therefore over the relation between P and Q. 
Thus, (10a) implies that my visiting Kim will not entail her being happy. In this example, not negates the 
relation between P (the speaker’s visit) (=[+p]) and Q (Kim’s happiness) (=[+q]) rather than negating Q (or a 
constituent of Q) alone. Examples like (10a-b) are instances of ‘denied conditionals’ (to be distinguished 
from the ‘conditioned denials’ referred to above—see also James [1986: 467] and section 3.13). 
A third special type of negation is that effected by counterfactuality. As we will see in section 4.2.11, the 
counterfactuality of a clause functions as negation with widest scope over that clause. Thus, in I would’ve 
been happy if he’d come, the Q-clause implies—in fact, implicates (see section 8.3.2)—’It is not the case that 
I am happy’ (=‘not [+q]’), and the P-clause implies ‘It is not the case that he came’ (=‘not [+p]’). In I 
wouldn’t have been happy if he hadn’t come, the Q-clause implicates ‘It is not the case that I am not happy’ 
(=‘not [-q]’), while the P-clause implies ‘It is not the case that he didn’t come’ (=‘not [-p]’). (In section 4.1.3 
we will introduce the symbol # for negation resulting from counterfactuality. Thus, ‘not [-p]’ will be 
represented as ‘#[-p]’. A counterfactual sentence of the form ‘If [+p], [-q]’ implies ‘#[+p]’ and ‘#[-q]’. Thus, 
If I’d been there I’d have protested implies ‘I was not there’ and ‘I did not protest [at the relevant time].’) 
In the above paragraph we have used the terms ‘implicature’ and ‘implicate’. For those who are less 
familiar with linguistic pragmatics, it may be necessary to give a precise definition of these terms, which will 
play an important role in many sections of this book. An aspect of meaning (or rather interpretation) is an 
‘implicature’ (or is ‘implicated’) if it does not follow from the semantics of the construction or the lexical 
items (=words) used but rather from “principles of conversation” which are conventionally observed by “co-
operative” speakers and hearers (Grice 1991). For example, Clear away the glasses! is by implicature 
interpreted (and meant to be interpreted) as an instruction to clear away all the glasses that are relevant in a 
particular context. However, like all implicatures induced by conversational principles, this aspect of 
meaning (the=‘all the’) can be cancelled. This is the case, for example, in Clear away the glasses, except 
those that are not empty, and also in The person who cleared away the glasses overlooked those on the 
window-sill. The ways in which implicatures arise have been traced by Grice (1991) to four major principles, 
which he calls “Maxims”. These ‘Gricean Maxims’ are rules of conversation which are conventionally 
observed by “co-operative” speakers and hearers. Grice’s Maxims have been refined in later publications, for 
example in Levinson (2000), which has given rise to more complicated pragmatic principles, but we have 
preferred not to refer to these in this book. Grice’s less refined description of the principles of conversation 
will do for our present purposes. 
 
1.3.5. ‘[Name]-P conditionals’ and ‘[Name]-Q conditionals’ 
 
As we will see, P-clauses may express various meanings. For example, in ‘inferential’ conditionals (e.g. If 
Shakespeare isn’t the author of this play, someone else must have written it) the P-clause is ‘premise-
expressing’. We will adopt the convention of referring to conditionals with a premise-expressing P-clause as 
‘premise-expressing-P conditionals’. This is intended to make it clear that it is the P-clause rather than the 
conditional as a whole that is premise-expressing. Similarly, we will refer to conditionals with a performative 
Q-clause (e.g. If that’s what you think of me, I resign) as ‘performative-Q conditionals’. The same 
convention will be followed in the other cases where a particular label applies to the P-clause or Q-clause 
only. This will not only make for accuracy in applying labels but will also allow us to distinguish, for 
example, between ‘metalinguistic-Q conditionals’ (see section 10.1.4) and ‘metalinguistic-P conditionals’ 
(see section 10.3.4). 
 
1.3.6. Terminological confusion 

 
In the philosophical literature, conditionals are traditionally subdivided into “indicative” conditionals on the 
one hand, and “subjunctive” or “counterfactual” conditionals on the other—see e.g. Edgington (1997: 95). 
This classification is also adopted by several linguists, including Dancygier (1988b: 123), Givón (1995: 120), 
Wu (1993: 127). An indicative conditional is one in which the tenses have their normal temporal meaning 
(e.g. I always punish him if he does something wrong) or which is of the type I’ll punish you if you do 
something wrong (where, strictly speaking, the present tense does not have its normal temporal reference). 
Conditionals of the types I’d punish him if he did something wrong and I’d have punished him if he’d done 
something wrong are called “subjunctive” or “counterfactual”. 
Since we want to avoid any terminological confusion in this book, we will discard the labels “indicative 
conditional” and “subjunctive conditional” altogether and assign a much more specific meaning to 
‘counterfactual’: a condition P is counterfactual if it is interpreted as ‘contrary to fact’, i.e. as assumed to be 
true in a possible world which is incompatible with the real (actual) world. The following are examples of 
counterfactual-P conditionals: 
(11)  
a. 
If he {was / were} here, he would not approve of this decision. 
 
 
b. 
If he had been here, he would not have approved of this decision. 
It follows that we cannot apply the label ‘counterfactual-P’ to conditionals like the following: 
(12)  
a. 
I’d be surprised if he {was / were} an Irishman. 
 
 
b. 
If he found out about our plans, he could ruin everything. 
In sentences like these, the condition is represented as one whose fulfilment is unlikely, but not impossible. 
In this book we will call them ‘tentative-P conditionals’. ‘Tentative’ not only covers the idea of ‘tentative 
truth’, as in (12a-b), but also the possibility of using this type of conditional for reasons of tact, politeness, 
etc., as in Would you help me, please? or If you stepped aside for a moment, I could get through to the toilets. 
Comrie (1986), Fillmore (1986: 171), Declerck (1991b: 429-430), Wierzbicka (1997), Taylor (1997: 302) 
and many others use the label “hypothetical” instead of ‘tentative’, but we have decided not to follow this 
practice here, since other people appear to use “hypothetical” in various other senses. Thus, by 
“hypothetical” meaning Leech (1971: 111) understands the expression of the speaker’s assumption that the 
P-situation will not, does not, or did not take place. Judging from the examples, his “hypothetical” covers our 
‘tentative-P’ and ‘counterfactual-P’. Brée (1982: 149) illustrates his own use of “hypothetical” with the 
example If Angeline has jumped off the Empire State Building, she’s dead (which we consider as neither 
tentative-P nor counterfactual-P). Dudman (1991: 228) equates “hypothetical” with “inferential”. By 
contrast, Funk (1985: 404) uses “hypothetical” as a synonym of our ‘counterfactual-P’. Dancygier & 
Mioduszewska (1984: 129) and Langacker (1997: 220) use “hypothetical” in the sense of our ‘theoretical-P’ 
(or ‘nonfactual-P’). As we will see in section 3.10, a ‘theoretical’ world is any world which is not the actual 
world. Not only counterfactual-P and tentative-P conditionals have a theoretical-P meaning. ‘Open-P’ 
conditionals like If he pays us a visit, he’ll appreciate your presence also do, and so do ‘closed-P’ 
conditionals (e.g. If he’s coming here tomorrow anyway, we needn’t try and contact him today) and ‘neutral-
P’ conditionals (e.g. In your place I wouldn’t have helped him unless he’d paid me for it). Athanasiadou & 
Dirven (1997) and Werth (1997a: 247) use “hypothetical” where we speak of ‘open-P’. (An open P-world is 
one which the speaker assumes to possibly match the real world or the real-world-to-come, as in I’ll be happy 
if she passes her exam.) The broadest definition is adopted by Harder (1996), who considers any P-world as 
hypothetical: if “introduces a hypothetical mental space into the discourse” (p. 444). James (1986: 455) uses 
the term similarly, in the sense of ‘suppositional’, and Bailey (1989: 276) calls any P-clause a “hypothesis 
clause”. 
Because of this terminological confusion, we have deemed it best not to use the label ‘hypothetical’ at all. 
Sentences like (11a-b) and (12a-b) will be called ‘counterfactual-P’ and ‘tentative-P’ conditionals, 
respectively. The possible world created by if (at least in ‘case-specifying’ P-clauses—see section 3.8) will 
be called ‘suppositional’. 
 
1.4. Symbols and conventions 
 
1.4.1. Symbols and typeface 
 

The following symbols will be used in the following ways: 
(a) Braces (={...}) will be used to indicate alternative possibilities (e.g. If I {was / were} your father, I would 
spank you). 
(b) Square brackets will be used to refer to the polarity of the propositions of an ‘if P, Q’ conditional: P may 
be either [+p] or [-p], and Q may be either [+q] or [-q]. Square brackets will also be used to separate a 
conditional from its context, as in the following example: 
(13)  
[Michael had thought over the situation carefully.] If Rose wouldn’t tell him the truth, he would try to get it 
from Barbara. [And if she wouldn’t inform him either, he could always turn to Lily.] 
In addition, square brackets are used instead of round brackets in a stretch of text that is itself enclosed 
within round brackets. 
(c) We will use angle brackets (=<...>) to insert an explanatory comment or ellipted constituent into an 
example sentence: 
(14)  
Jim told Bill that he <=Bill> couldn’t come to the party. 
(d) An asterisk before a sentence or constituent will indicate not only syntactic ungrammaticality but also 
semantic-pragmatic unacceptability, or the fact that the asterisked sentence is not a good paraphrase of the 
sentence under discussion. 
(e) A superscript question mark will be used similarly to indicate that a sentence or constituent is 
questionable for a grammatical or semantic-pragmatic reason. A double superscript question mark indicates 
an even higher degree of questionability. 
(f) The grammaticality or acceptability judgements indicated by an asterisk or one or two superscript 
question marks are based on ‘Standard British English’—see Quirk et al. (1985:19-23). 
(g) Small capitals in an example identify the word receiving the nuclear accent of the clause, or (in most 
cases) an extra heavy contrastive accent. 
(h) Italics will be used for four purposes: (i) in comments added to examples, (ii) in example sentences that 
are incorporated into the main text, (iii) to emphasize a word in the text, and (iv) in order to indicate the 
relevant word(s) in a numbered example. 
(i) Real quotations are placed within double quotation marks. Single quotation marks are used to indicate 
concepts, paraphrases, word strings, etc. 
 
1.4.2. Conventions 
 
(a) As is not uncommon in the recent literature, we will refer to the speaker as she and to the hearer as he. 
(b) We will use see to refer to publications from which we borrow an insight. See also will be used to refer to 
authors who have come to the same conclusions as we have.

As far as the COB-S examples are concerned, sometimes very minor alterations to these spoken examples 
have been made in the interest of easier intelligibility. These include the insertion of commas, some 
suppression of hesitation signals such as er, and ‘correction’ of small production errors where the intended 
utterance is obvious, such as the amendment of you’ll only buy able to buy to you’ll only be able to buy. In 
cases where we have taken more liberty with the original, the example is noted as ‘adapted’. 

Chapter 2 
 
Conditional connecting devices 
 
 
The majority of conditional clauses are introduced by conjunctions or phrases like if, even if, unless, 
providing / provided (that), on condition that, on the understanding that, as/so long as, in case. In some 
cases there is no conjunction but inversion (e.g. Had he seen this, he would have been curious). There are 
also other types of subclause (such as relative clauses or temporal clauses) that may have a conditional 
connotation. It is the purpose of this chapter to have a look at the various conditional connectors and to 
review a number of nonconditional sentence types which have a conditional meaning or connotation. 
 
2.1. If 
 
This is without any doubt the unmarked conditional conjunction: it can be used in virtually every one of the 
dozens of types and subtypes of conditionals that we will distinguish in this book. It is only restricted in that 
it cannot replace such semantically richer connectives as unless, in case and lest. 
As we will see, most (but not all) if-clauses express a supposition and in doing so create a suppositional 
world, which is usually (but not always—see our discussion of ‘factual-P conditionals’ in sections 3.10.1 and 
4.1) a theoretical (intensional) world, i.e. a possible world which, in terms of truth conditions, is either 
different from the actual world or unrelated to it. Rigter (1982: 96) defines an intensional world as “a domain 
of interpretation which has its own set of presuppositions and truth conditions, in terms of which 
propositions can be evaluated and interpreted.” Making use of Fauconnier’s (1985) theory of mental spaces, 
Harder (1996) says that if differs from other subordinators in that (at least in its core use) “it introduces a 
hypothetical mental space into the discourse, and part of the work of understanding consists on the one hand 
in keeping the hypothetical space distinct from the parent reality space, and on the other in relating the two 
spaces in the right way” (p. 444). In other words, the validity of Q (=the Q-proposition) is interpreted in 
relation to this suppositional P-world. At the same time, however, the truth of Q is interpreted in the light of 
the type of truth relation that exists between the intensional world and the real world. Thus, in a 
‘counterfactual-P’ conditional like I would’ve been happy if she’d helped me, both clauses are interpreted as 
true in a supposed counterfactual world but false in the actual world. 
It should be noted in passing that in this book we will speak of suppositional ‘worlds’ rather than of 
suppositional ‘mental spaces’. The reason for using the former (nowadays less fashionable) term is simply a 
practical one: it is handier to speak of ‘P-worlds’ and ‘Q-worlds’ than to use the labels ‘P-mental spaces’ and 
‘Q-mental spaces’. (This is not to say that ‘mental space’ is simply synonymous with ‘possible world’. 
However, either concept is usable and satisfactory when we are concerned with the description and 
categorization of conditionals.) 
As we will see, the link (expressed by if) between P and Q can be of various kinds and may have various 
connotations (e.g. causative,4 contrastive, concessive, etc.) In some cases the link is very weak and/or 
difficult to describe in well-defined semantic terms. What all if-conditionals have in common, though, is that 
there has to be some kind of link between P and Q—see Akatsuka (1991: 28-29) for arguments supporting 
this claim. However, the precise nature of this link is not signalled by the word if itself. 
The claim that there is always some kind of link between P and Q is not uncontroversial. According to 
Woods (1997: 16), “when someone believes that Q, whether or not P” he “believes there is no connection 
between P and Q.” In our view, I will do it whether you help me or not does not express a single ‘if P, Q’ 
relation but comprises two ‘if P, Q’ conditionals: ‘I will do it if you help me’ and ‘I will do it if you don’t 
help me.’ In both cases there is a link between P and Q. Besides, Woods would surely have problems with a 
conditional like I will have a peanut-butter sandwich whether Venus is nearer to the sun than Mars or not, 
which is extremely difficult to find a context for, and thus pragmatically very odd. By Woods’ account, there 
                                              
4. 
According to Comrie (1986: 80), if-conditionals always require a a causal connection between the two 
propositions. Wierzbicka (1997: 19-20) rightly rejects this: if does not imply because in sentences like If he is 
asleep, I will not wake him up (which we will refer to as ‘purely case-specifying-P conditionals’—see section 9.3). 

should not be any problem, because if there is no connection between P and Q then this sentence should be as 
acceptable as I will have a peanut-butter sandwich whether supper will be ready soon or not. 
Harder (1996: 449) also appears to deny the necessity of a link between P and Q when he speaks of “the 
conceptual emptiness of the ‘if’-relation.” However, it seems to us that this claim is an exaggeration: the fact 
that we cannot assign one invariant meaning to if does not mean that there is no specific relation between P 
and Q in if-conditionals. Whenever a conditional is used, the kind of relation expressed should be identifiable 
to the hearer. 
 
2.2. Connectors expressing a necessary condition 
 
The phrases only if, providing / provided (that), on condition that, and on the understanding that all express a 
necessary, condition (‘if and only if’): 
(15)  
I will not report this to the boss {on condition that / provided that} you promise never to do it 
again. 
P-clauses introduced by such conjunctions will be called ‘prerequisite P-clauses’. (Note that there are no 
conjunctions specifically representing a condition as sufficient but not necessary, or as both sufficient and 
necessary—see chapter 11.) 
 
2.3. Unless 
 
Unless has several meanings and uses, but it would be premature to discuss them in detail here. A full 
discussion of unless will be offered in chapter 13. For the moment it may suffice to say that the basic 
meaning of ‘Q unless P’ is ‘Q in a case other than P’. In nonirrealis unless-conditionals, this generally means 
that ‘Q unless P’ is equivalent to ‘Q except if P’. 
(16)  
a. 
{Unless / Except if} you point out the consequences, people ignore the warning.  (‘except if 
[+p], [+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
{Unless / except if} the body is not discovered for a long time the police pathologist will see 
that the man has been tortured.  (‘except if [-p], [+q]’) 
 
 
c. 
I won’t do it {unless / except if} you help me.  (‘[-q] except if [+p]’) 
 
 
d. 
I won’t do it unless nobody else knows about it.  (‘[-q] except if [-p]’) 
 
2.4. In case 
 
In case can be used with a kind of conditional meaning, even if British English does not normally use it in 
the sense of if. As we will see immediately below, the more normal uses of in case are the ‘precautionary’ 
use (as in I carried an umbrella in case it rained), the ‘preventative’ use (as in I wore sunglasses in case I 
was recognized), its use after expressions of apprehension (fear or concern) (as in She was frightened in case 
something happened to her child), and its use as a substitute for if in what we will call ‘relevance 
conditionals’ (as in In case you need a car, you can rent one here—see section 10.1.1). In all these 
interpretations, in case combines the semantics of if with those of because or so that. (A fuller discussion of 
P-clauses introduced by in case is to be found in section 9.1.2.5. Section 6.4.4 investigates the verb forms 
that can be used in in case-clauses.) 
If in case has a ‘precautionary’ meaning, the P-clause refers to a possible situation which someone 
(usually the speaker or the referent of the subject of the Q-clause) is preparing for or is taking precautions 
against (i.e. in case=‘because there might be a situation in which’, ‘for the possibility that ... might’, ‘so that 
... if’, ‘because ... perhaps / might’). 
(17)  
a. 
I always have my credit card in my pocket in case there {is / *will be} a bargain.  (=so that I 
will have it with me if there’s a bargain) 
 
 
b. 
I carried a couple of magazines in my bag in case I {had / should have / *would have} to wait 
a long time at the airport.  (=so that I had them with me if I had to wait a long time) 
 
 
c. 
I’m thinking of insuring my car in case it {gets / *will get} stolen.  (=so that {it’s / I’m} 
covered if it gets stolen) 
 
 
d. 
I go armed with immodium tablets in case I need them.  (COB-W) 

 
 
e. 
[Anna told me to give you this.] It’s a spare key for the car in case anything should happen to 
me tonight.  (COB-W) 
In these examples, the implication is that someone (the speaker, or the referent of the subject noun phrase of 
the Q-clause, or someone mentioned in the preceding context, such as Anna in [17e]) wants to be prepared 
for, or is taking precautions against, a situation that might actualize in the future. In some examples, the 
situation in question is not a future one but one that is actualizing or has actualized: 
(18)  
a. 
I’m washing the apples in case they’re not clean. 
 
 
b. 
Always wear gloves when gardening and wash your hands thoroughly afterwards in case the 
soil has been contaminated with cat faeces.  (COB-W) 
If the Q-clause refers to the past, the situation referred to in the in case-clause can similarly be posterior, 
simultaneous or anterior to the Q-situation: 
(19)  
a. 
He looked for another bell, in case the one he had been ringing was at fault.  (LOB) 
(simultaneity) 
 
 
b. 
[If you do continue working,] it’s worth looking into an income protection scheme in case you 
or your partner should be injured or become ill and unable to work.  (COB-W) (posteriority) 
 
 
c. 
I took a spare key of the house with me in case it had been locked.  (anteriority) 
The precautionary meaning of in case in such examples is the same as is inherent in the expression just in 
case: 
(20)  
It looked safe enough to him to let go of the door, but just in case, he looked round for something 
to prop against it [so that it could not shut].  (LOB) (‘just in case’ = ‘just in case it wasn’t safe 
enough’) 
In case can also have a preclusive (preventative) meaning. In that case it is used to introduce a P-clause 
referring to a situation which the speaker or the subject of the Q-clause wants to prevent: 
(21)  
a. 
She never let the child play in the street in case he {was / should be} run over. 
 
 
b. 
[Outside it was blowing a blizzard.] I had to watch where I put my feet in case I fell.  (LOB) 
 
 
c. 
The pond has to be absolutely free of any obstacle in case they bruise.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[“It was my fault,” he said after a brief silence.] “I thought Sabrina and I should hold back in 
case Lemmer saw us. [I misjudged the distance.]”  (COB-W) 
The implication is that the speaker or the referent of the subject noun phrase of the Q-clause wants (or 
wanted or has wanted) to preclude the P-situation actualizing. 
A third use of in case-clauses is after expressions of fear, apprehension, worry, concern. In this use the in 
case-clause expresses an anticipated P-situation: 
(22)  
a. 
[When we tracked her down she was anxious to explain that no one in Fribourg knew who she 
was and] said she was concerned in case her cover was blown.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[Now that her task was so nearly accomplished,] she was growing hourly more and more 
frightened in case anything should happen at the eleventh hour to stop her getting the flat.  
(LOD) 
 
 
c. 
We were scared in case he would punch us or really beat us up you know what I mean.  (COB-
S) 
 
 
d. 
[The reason for this is that] Moscow is worried in case a precedent is set.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
[Erm er Labour knows this country is the best in Europe but] they are running scared in case 
all the voters get the full truth [so they are full of lies and silly promises to get into power].  
(COB-S) 
In this use, in case has neither a precautionary nor a preclusive (preventative) meaning. It introduces a 
complement clause spelling out the contents of (or reason for) the fear, concern, etc. and is therefore more or 
less equivalent to that.5 
                                              
5. 
This comment makes it clear that, in spite of appearances, the following is not an illustration of this use of in case: 

In case can also be used in the sense of ‘if it is the case that’. This usage is more common in American 
English than in British English, which prefers if.6 
(23)  
a. 
{In case / if} you need any money I can lend you some.  (Cambridge International Dictionary 
of English, 1995: 201) 
 
 
b. 
In case UPS is unable to complete delivery of a package, a nondelivery notice will be left at 
the Consignee’s address stating that delivery has been attempted.  (Cobuild US corpus) 
In case is ‘actualization-conditioning’ here (i.e. the in case-clause expresses the situation that triggers the Q-
situation), just as it is in the complex preposition in case of (=‘in case there is’): 
(24)  
a. 
In case of any discrepancy between the limits delineated in the said map or plan and the limits 
described in subsection (1) of this section the said map or plan shall be deemed to be correct 
and shall prevail.  (LOB) 
 
 
b. 
Get back to the bedroom and change clothes in case of bloodstains.  (LOB) 
A fifth use of in case is to introduce a ‘relevance-expressing’ P-clause (i.e. a P-clause making clear why the 
speaker deems it relevant to utter the Q-clause—see section 10.1.1): 
(25)  
a. 
[“...the story that’s been in the papers this morning about Patsy Kensit.” — “Yeah.”] — “Er in 
case you missed it, it says she’s in hospital after having an emergency operation to remove her 
appendix.”  (COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
In case you’ve just returned from Mars, that severe weather is causing havoc around the 
country.  (COB-S) 
 
 
c. 
I’m Abby Paladrey—Mort’s sister, just in case you didn’t get things clear when we were 
introduced.  (LOB) 
Now that we have identified the possible uses / meanings of in case, a further remark is in order. According 
to Wood (1967: 33), “for if (e.g. ‘They took their umbrellas for if it should rain’) is sometimes heard in 
spoken English, but ... is not regarded as correct. The accepted idiom is in case.” However, we have not 
found a single example in our corpora in which for if could be replaced by in case. In the two examples with 
for if that we have found, for if has a very specific meaning, viz. ‘for the [possible] case in which’—a 
meaning which cannot normally be expressed by in case in British English. For example: 
(26)  
“I’d never go back to a touring bike.” — “Not even for if you’d just moved to a city and never 
wanted to go off-road again?”  (COB-S) 
                                                                                                                                                      
 
(i) 
Trainees often put up with terrible conditions and are afraid to complain in case they are chucked off the 
scheme and have their dole stopped.  (COB-W) 
 
Here it is to complain that is the complement clause of afraid. In case is not interchangeable with that and receives 
the preventative interpretation. 
On the other hand, there are examples in which the expression of fear has a complement and in case cannot be 
replaced by that, but the in case-clause specifies the reason for the fear rather than having a preventative or 
precautionary meaning: 
 
(ii) a. 
“At one time I used to be even terrified of my own mum looking after him” — “Mm” — “in case his 
behaviour was beyond what she could control.”  (COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
I’m too scared to tell him in case he doesn’t feel the same way. 
 
(iia) means ‘I used to be even terrified of my own mum looking after him—I was terrified in case his behaviour 
was beyond what she could control.’ It cannot be interpreted as ‘I was terrified of my mum looking after him as a 
precaution against the possibility that his behaviour might be beyond what she could control’ or as ‘I was terrified 
of my mum looking after him because I wanted to prevent his behaviour being beyond what she could control’, 
even though a paraphrase in terms of ‘because...might’ is possible: ‘I was terrified of my mum looking after him 
because his behaviour might be beyond what she could control.’ Similarly, (iib) can be paraphrased: ‘I’m scared to 
tell him. I’m scared in case he doesn’t feel the same way.’ (Another way of putting this is that the complement 
clause is somehow part of the scaredness—and the in case-clause relates to that complex scaredness.) 
6. 
In this sense, in case translates in Dutch as ingeval (‘in case’), whereas in its precautionary, preclusive and 
relevance-expressing senses it translates as voor het geval dat (‘for the case that’). 

On the other hand, for when can sometimes be used instead of in case (the only difference being that for 
when presupposes belief in actualization): 
(27)  
a. 
(father speaking to daughter some time after the disappearance of her brother in Spain)  
[“Why did you go back to Spain? Why didn’t you stay here in England, with me?” — “I had 
to go back. You see,] I had to be there for when he came back.”  (BBC drama) 
 
 
b. 
All these fires are lit to warm the house for when you get there.  (HOW) 
 
 
c. 
[Martin left early, having taken from the bathroom cabinet one of the sleeping pills] his 
mother had for when she went on holiday.  (LOD) 
 
2.5. Lest 
 
The conjunction lest is an alternative to in case in the ‘preventative’ use (as in I wore sunglasses lest I should 
be recognized), after expressions of apprehension (fear or concern) (as in She was growing more and more 
frightened lest anything should go wrong) and in ‘relevance-expressing’ P-clauses (e.g. Lest you should think 
the film is too violent, it’s not). Lest is usually found in formal contexts and would certainly be very marked 
in informal conversation. 
 
2.6. Even if and only if 
 
Athanasiadou & Dirven (1997: 79) treat only if as a single “complex conjunction”. Many people assume the 
same kind of analysis for even if. However, von Fintel (1997: 1) and Van der Auwera (1997) see only if as a 
combination of if and a focusing adverb, and Fraser (1969: 66), James (1986: 472) and McCawley (1981: 51) 
argue a similar analysis for even if. We basically agree with the latter analyses. In only if-conditionals, only 
has its normal focusing (in this case: restrictive) meaning. The same is generally true of even in even if-
conditionals, though there are cases in which the addition of even to if may have a special effect. It will 
therefore be necessary to have a closer look at even if-conditionals. However, it would be premature to do so 
at this point. A full discussion of even if will be offered in chapter 14. 
 
2.7. Whether...or 
 
This correlative conjunction can be used to express alternative (disjunctive) conditions. 
(28)  
a. 
Whether you are overweight or not, it is always better to watch your diet.  (polar alternatives: 
‘It is better to watch your diet if you are overweight’ + ‘It is better to watch your diet if you 
are not overweight.’) 
 
 
b. 
Whether you did it or Mary (did it), the whole class will be punished. 
Note that we cannot use if...or in such ‘alternative-P conditionals’. It is also interesting to see that, although 
the conditions are disjunctive (i.e. only one of them can be satisfied), the meaning of whether A or B is not 
‘either if A or if B’ but ‘both if A and if B’. 
 
2.8. Supposing, assuming, etc. 
 
The participles supposing and assuming, as well as the exhortative let’s suppose / assume / say and the 
imperatives suppose / imagine can introduce a ‘case-specifying’ P-clause: 
(29)  
a. 
Imagine you were the murderer. Where would you have hidden the knife? 
 
 
b. 
Just suppose someone had overheard that conversation!  (Compare: “What if someone had 
overheard that conversation!”) 
 
 
c. 
{Let’s suppose / supposing} we had run into our neighbours. What would we have said to 
them? 
 
 
d. 
Let’s say that you are right. Where does it lead us? 
 
 
e. 
{Assuming / if} John is there too, what will you say to him? 
The P-clauses here use the same verb forms as we observe in if-clauses, and they have much the same 
meaning as if-clauses. (However, they may have slightly different connotations. For example, the Collins 

Cobuild Dictionary defines supposing as “considering a possible situation or course of action and trying to 
decide what results or effects it would have”, and assuming as “considering something true even though it 
might not be true so that you can think about what the consequences would be or give an opinion about it.”) 
What is particular to the exhortative and imperative constructions is that they shape the P-clause in the 
form of a syntactically independent clause, so that the Q-clause (if overtly present) must also be syntactically 
independent. 
There are a couple of other verb forms that can be used similarly: 
(30)  
a. 
Take it, for the sake of supposition, that I were to accept your offer.  (Jespersen 1932: 116) 
(rather formal or old-fashioned) 
 
 
b. 
Given that she is interested in children, teaching seems to be the right career for her. 
 
 
c. 
Let ABC be a triangle whose sides are 1 metre long. Its surface will be less than 0.5 m². 
 
2.9. Zero-conjunction plus inversion 
 
Especially in more formal English, it is possible to find constructions with ‘zero-conjunction’ and inversion, 
provided that the main verb of the conditional clause is a ‘modal past perfect’ or is preceded by should or 
were to. 
(31)  
a. 
Should someone ring, tell them I’ll be at the office till six. 
 
 
b. 
Had the body been discovered sooner, the police would no doubt have found more clues. 
 
 
c. 
Were he to try that again, I’d go to the police. 
 
 
d. 
Robyn ... always had a packet handy should the need arise.  (NW) 
A similar construction used to be possible with were (without to), with could and with the lexical verb had. 
However, such sentences are now (very) formal, literary or even obsolescent: 
(32)  
a. 
Imagine the feelings of Addison, could his shade revisit the earth, gazing down upon what 
once were the fields and woods of his ‘Old Kensington’.  (Kruisinga 1932: 440) 
 
 
b. 
Had the greatest critics always power to make men love and admire that which they loved and 
admired, then Congreve were assuredly one of his country’s favourites.  (Kruisinga 1932: 440) 
 
 
c. 
Were I you I should devote myself for a week to their little performances.  (Kruisinga 1932: 
441) 
 
 
d. 
The reader would never dream of taking such person as Rawdon and his aunt seriously, were 
he not told to do so by the author of their being.  (Kruisinga 1932: 441) 
The present subjunctive form be can occasionally be found too, especially in alternative-P conditionals: 
(33)  
[I affirm that if Booth does not kill Lincoln, someone else will. I expect it to be Booth, but,] be I 
right or wrong about that part of the story, [what I am confident of is that it will be someone or 
other, and so if not Booth, then someone else.]  (Jackson 1998: 40) 
 
2.10. Comparative conditionals 
 
Examples like the following also express a conditional relationship: 
(34)  
a. 
The more we hurry, the sooner we’ll get there.  (Compare: if we hurry more, we’ll get there 
sooner.) 
 
 
b. 
The {more / less} I help him, the {more / less} he likes me. 
 
 
c. 
The more tired Bruce is, the less accurately he works. 
This type of construction with a conditional meaning (or connotation) is discussed by Beck (1997), Fillmore 
(1986: 163-166), McCawley (1988), Thiersch (1982) and Wold (1991). However, these authors are mistaken 
when they claim that ALL the...the...-constructions yield a conditional interpretation. A sentence like The 
longer I knew him, the less I understood him is not interpreted as ‘If I knew him longer, I understood him 
less.’ There is no conditional interpretation either in The more I listened to him yesterday, the less I could 
believe him. 
 
2.11. Adverbial clauses with a conditional connotation 

 
Apart from conditional subclauses, there are other adverbial subclauses that can have a conditional 
connotation: 
 
2.11.1. Extraposed subject clauses 
(35)  
It’s not important if you don’t understand all of it.  (=If you don’t understand all of it, [the fact] 
that you don’t understand all of it is not important) 
For more discussion, see section 11.13.1. 
 
2.11.2. Restrictive relative clauses 
 
Compare: 
(36)  
a. 
Any mistake that should be made is immediately corrected by the machine itself. 
 
 
b. 
If a mistake should be made, it is immediately corrected by the machine itself. 
 
2.11.3. Adverbial time clauses 
 
2.11.3.1. Time clauses introduced by after (when contrasted with before) 
(37)  
You will be paid AFTER the job is finished, not before.  (=You will [only] be paid if the job is 
finished first.) 
 
2.11.3.2. Before-clauses 
 
Before-clauses can have a clear conditional connotation. As noted in Declerck (1999a: 215, 221), we can 
distinguish between two types. The first is illustrated by sentences like 
(38)  
a. 
We had to force the lock before we could open the door. 
 
 
b. 
They had to kill him before they could get at his money. 
 
 
c. 
We will have to get past the guard before we can enter the room. 
In this ‘A before B’ type of sentence the actualization of the B-situation requires (is conditioned by) the 
actualization of the A-situation. The A-clause therefore typically uses an auxiliary expressing (nonepistemic) 
necessity. If the sentence is in the past tense, as in (38a-b), the before-clause receives a factual interpretation. 
This follows from the application of the following principle, which is inspired by Heinämäki (1978: 61): a 
before-clause in the past tense receives a factual interpretation if the head clause-situation is represented as 
factual and its actualization is seen as a necessary and sufficient condition for the before-clause-situation to 
actualize. Sentences like (38a-b) are also special in that they do not allow the insertion of a measure phrase 
(e.g. long) before the before-clause. As a rule, factual before-clauses do allow such an insertion (e.g. 
Apparently he left long before we arrived). The fact that a measure phrase is not allowed here is a sign that 
the before-clause is not primarily interpreted as a time adverbial but that the sentence is read as a kind of 
conditional. This means that the idea of temporal precedence has been metaphorically extended to the idea of 
logical precedence: the head clause and the before-clause express something like condition and consequent, 
or cause and effect. 
The second type consists of before-clauses with a counterfactual conditional connotation. Out of context, 
the before-clause of (39a) is interpreted as counterfactual (=contrary to fact), whereas that of (39b) is not: 
(39)  
a. 
Harry put money in the parking meter before a policeman gave him a ticket. 
 
 
b. 
Harry blew his nose before a policeman gave him a ticket. 
These examples come from Heinämäki (1978: 52), according to whom a before-clause (in a sentence of this 
type) will be interpreted as counterfactual if the hearer holds that the following conditional is true: ‘If the 
head clause-situation had not actualized, then the before-clause-situation would have actualized later.’ Unlike 
(39a), (39b) does not yield a counterfactual interpretation because the following conditional is not plausible: 
‘If Harry had not blown his nose, a policeman would have given him a ticket later.’ Another way of 
formulating this principle is as follows: when both the head clause and the before-clause are in the past tense, 

the before-clause is given a counterfactual interpretation if the actualization of the head clause situation is 
seen as a necessary and sufficient condition for the nonactualization of the before-clause situation. 
 
2.11.3.3. Until-clauses 
 
Not...until frequently introduces a time clause with a conditional connotation: 
(40)  
a. 
Nothing will change until there is a change of government.  (=as long as there is no change...) 
 
 
b. 
I won’t give you your bike back until you’ve paid me back the £20 I lent you last year. 
Even in combination with a positive Q-clause, until may have a conditional connotation: 
(41)  
I’ll keep your bike until you’ve paid me back the £20 I lent you last year.  (Paying me back is a 
precondition for getting your bike back.) 
Notice also the stereotyped phrase unless and until, which can introduce a P-clause depending on a negative 
Q-clause: 
(42)  
a. 
[The effect of failure to stamp a lease or other document is not to invalidate the document;] 
but the document is not admissible as evidence unless and until it is properly stamped and any 
penalty is paid.  (LOB) 
 
 
b. 
[Mrs Caine said] we were to go no further unless and until we were sent for.  (LOB) 
 
2.11.3.4. {As/so} long as 
 
{As/so} long as expresses duration, but may have the connotation of a necessary condition: 
(43)  
a. 
You can use my camera as long as you pay for the films yourself. 
 
 
b. 
[“You’ll get nothing out of me,” said John,] “but you can pay for my drinks if you want to, as 
long as you keep off Service matters.”  (LOB) 
 
 
c. 
[It is a mistake to think that hydrangeas need no water at all during the winter months—those 
growing outside are kept moist enough!—and] as long as they are kept cool enough to prevent 
premature growth it is quite safe to give them just sufficient to keep the green bud at the tip of 
each stem nice and plump.  (LOB) 
 
2.11.3.5. The moment (that), as soon as, once 
 
(44)  
a. 
[This tall man is a rascally adventurer.] The moment he married the widow, he would sell off 
all the furniture, and run away. (Jespersen 1932: 312)  (Compare: If he married the widow, he 
would at once sell off...) 
 
 
b. 
[I knew he was lying.] As soon as I had left the house he would do what I had asked him not 
to do. 
 
 
c. 
Once you see the effect of those hard words, you’ll want to speak more softly.  (Bolinger 
1977: 158) 
 
2.11.3.6. When-clauses 
 
As a rule, when differs from if in that it implies factuality. Compare: 
(45)  
a. 
I’ll deliver the goods if you pay me.  (The speaker does not seem very sure that she will be 
paid.) 
 
 
b. 
I’ll deliver the goods when you pay me.  (The speaker takes it for granted that she will be 
paid. The payment is not a question of ‘if’ but of ‘when’ [=time].) 
However, there are cases in which when does not trigger a factual understanding. A clear example is irony: 
(46)  
I’ll become a monarchist when the queen starts taking the 49 bus to the opening of parliament. 
There is a clear conditional connotation here. Similarly, I’ll deliver the goods when you pay me can in theory 
have a conditional connotation if the speaker is sure of not being paid, and is being ironic. 

Apart from irony, there are sentences in which the conditional connotation of when is quite clear: 
(47)  
a. 
I’ll stop ‘nagging’ you when you start doing what you’ve promised to do. 
 
 
b. 
You know I’m compliance itself—when I’m not thwarted.  (Poutsma 1929: 669) 
 
 
c. 
There’s never a dull moment in a mealtime when you use Heinz Pickles.  (Edgren 1971: 226) 
In the following examples, when means ‘in a case when’ or ‘in cases when’ and could therefore be replaced 
by ‘case-specifying’ if (see section 3.8): 
(48)  
a. 
You can’t ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the 
marketplace.  (WSJ) 
 
 
b. 
Who wants to read or listen to what some old writer has pumped out of his diseased heart 
when he can read a balanced and reasoned judgement about life, love and literature from an 
aloof and informed commentator?  (OSB) 
Case-specifying if can also replace when if the latter means ‘in the case when’ or ‘in those cases when / 
where’: 
(49)  
a. 
[Many modern scriptwriters seem to be incapable of writing drama, or anything else, without 
foul-mouthed cursing.] Sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant 
to the script.  (WSJ) 
 
 
b. 
Entries are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the 
dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased.  (BR) 
 
 
c. 
Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right 
when the motives are right.  (BR) 
 
 
d. 
There are many stone circles—we call them standing stones even when they are recumbent.  
(Edgren 1971: 228) 
 
 
e. 
You have much more flexibility when you’re a private company.  (WSJ) 
In the following example the speaker uses if and when without any apparent difference of meaning: 
(50)  
If the market surges, holders can make that much more profit; [the leverage effectively acts as an 
interest-free margin account for investors.] But when the market moves against the fund, investors 
lose more than other junk holders [because the market decline is magnified by the amount the fund 
is leveraged.]  (WSJ) 
Another type of case-specifying when-clause which is interchangeable with an if-clause is the type which we 
will call ‘set-restricting’ (see section 3.9): 
(51)  
a. 
Children are orphans {when / if} their parents are dead.  (The P-clause restricts the set of 
children to the set of children without parents; what is said in the Q-clause only applies to this 
subset.) 
 
 
b. 
A woman is more highly respected {when / if} she goes out to work than {when / if} she stays 
at home.  (The P-clause restricts the set of women to the subset of women that go out to work; 
the Q-predication applies only to the latter subset.) 
 
 
c. 
A man is little use if his wife is a widow.  (Scottish proverb) 
 
 
d. 
When a novel is given over entirely to the Romantic experience it ceases to be a novel.  (LOB) 
In such examples the when-clause has a purely restrictive (and therefore quantifying) function: it does not 
specify a time (or times). 
A further use of case-specifying when-clauses where when seems to be equivalent to if is to be observed 
in specificational sentences, i.e. in focusing sentences specifying a ‘value’ for a ‘variable’, as in Their leader 
is: John, The one who is their leader is John, It is John who is their leader and JOHN is their leader, where 
‘the x who is their leader’ and John represent the variable and the value, respectively. (For a more detailed 
discussion, see section 3.14 and especially section 11.14.) 
(52)  
a. 
The only problem is when people do not want to co-operate. 
 
 
b. 
[In Britain, the former rule was that the socially superior person should be the first to extend 
a hand—and as few people of gentle instincts like, nowadays, to claim social superiority, the 
usage is less often followed.] Exceptions are when a much younger person is introduced to 

an older one, or where the distinction of rank is obvious; then the senior person, if she 
wishes, will extend a hand.  (LOB) 
Case-specifying when can also substitute for if in some P-clauses expressing a ‘factual’ condition: 
(53)  
a. 
What the hell do I care for the dead knowledge of evil when I’m blessed with a sister as sweet 
as this?  (WESK) (‘when’=‘in this case, in which’) 
 
 
b. 
[I was going to give a final demonstration this afternoon.] But how can I demonstrate a 
machine when it doesn’t work properly?  (MILN) (‘when’=‘in a case like this, in which’) 
 
 
c. 
[Indeed this is one of the reasons I don’t go to the theatre:] it’s hard to believe in Pastor 
Manders when you knew him first as a somewhat below average window cleaner.  (BEN) (id.) 
Case-specifying when-clauses giving instances are also more or less equivalent to if-clauses: 
(54)  
It’s like when you have five kids and someone asks which one is your favorite.  (WSJ) 
Like if-clauses, when-clauses may have a contrastive or concessive connotation. (This does not mean, 
however, that in the following examples when could simply be replaced by if: when has a factual meaning, 
while if would be interpreted as either ‘neutral’ or ‘closed’.) 
(55)  
a. 
How is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he cannot guarantee a return flight?  (WSJ) 
 
 
b. 
How does one know what it is one believes when it’s so difficult to know what it is one 
knows?  (STOP) 
 
 
c. 
Why do you remember now what I said then, when I can’t remember myself?  (BARN) 
 
 
d. 
Joe said he would not choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing {when / if} it would 
be so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country road.  [adapted 
from LOB] (Using ‘if’ would produce a silly closed-P reading. It would make Joe say / think: 
“Oh well, I hadn’t thought of taking my victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country road 
before killing him, but now that you suggest it, and that I accept that it would be so much 
safer, I won’t choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing.”) 
A final type of when-clause that has a conditional connotation, and in which if could actually be used instead 
of when belongs to the class of ‘focalizing when-clauses’. Declerck (1997a: 31) defines these as follows: 
“Focalizing when-clauses differ from canonical <=unmarked adverbial> when-clauses in that they do not 
specify the time of the head clause situation or a time to which the time of the head clause situation is related. 
Instead they express the speaker’s focus on a time of evaluation or observation.” 
We can distinguish two types of focalizing when-clauses in which if could replace when. To begin with, 
there are the focalizing when-clauses which suggest the idea of a travelling observing consciousness: 
(56)  
a. 
[Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in Sugar Ditch, but] when you travel 
to Washington, Boston, Chicago or New York, the same problems exist.  (WSJ) 
 
 
b. 
As to Saxon times, when you leave the Thames, there is scanty evidence.  (Edgren 1971: 83) 
In both examples, if can be substituted for when. 
Secondly, when has a conditional connotation in focalizing when-clauses which indicate what may be 
called the ‘epistemic time of evaluation’, i.e. the time when the conclusion is reached that the statement made 
in the head clause is true: 
(57)  
a. 
When you look at the economics, Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it 
work.  (WSJ) 
 
 
b. 
The Liberal achievement is all the more remarkable when one remembers the disadvantages 
under which the Liberal candidates worked.  (LOB) 
 
 
c. 
When one considers the impositions, I’m not surprised you failed.  (ROSS) 
 
2.11.4. Paratactic conditionals 
 
These are structures which have the meaning of a conditional but the form of a coordinate sentence ‘P and Q’ 
or ‘P or Q’: 
(58)  
a. 
Do that or I’ll punish you! 
 
 
b. 
Do that and I’ll punish you! 

(59)  
a. 
Publish or perish! 
 
 
b. 
Publish or you can forget about your career! 
(60)  
a. 
[The manager’s very short-tempered.] I make a tiny mistake and I get shouted at.

The various subtypes of paratactic conditionals are examined in section 11.13. 
 
2.12. Conclusion 
 
In this chapter we have had a brief look at the various conjunctions that can introduce a P-clause, and at 
several other connectives or clause types that can express or connote a conditional meaning. Though the use 
of if is by far the commonest means to express conditionality, the number of other possibilities is much 
higher than might be expected at first sight. The reason for this is that the array of possible meanings covered 
by the label ‘conditional(ity)’ is very wide. This will become even clearer when we have a more detailed 
look at some of the various connectives in later chapters. 

Chapter 3 
 
Some preliminary terminology 
 
 
In this chapter we will introduce a number of terms and concepts which are essential to a good understanding 
of the next chapters. What is denoted by these terms is often explained in greater detail further on in the 
book. 
 
3.1. ‘Subordinate’ clauses 
 
Apart from paratactic conditionals like Do it {and/or} I’ll punish you! and comparative conditionals like The 
more I work, the more I earn (which exemplify ‘cosubordination’, i.e. neither clause is independent, but 
neither is part of the other), conditional sentences typically consist of a head clause (Q-clause), which may or 
may not be syntactically independent (e.g. [I’m telling you that] I’ll punish you if you do that), and a 
subordinate P-clause (conditional clause). The term ‘subordinate’ will be used here in its traditional sense, 
which is defined as follows in the (1995) version of the Cambridge International Dictionary of English: “In 
grammar, ‘subordinate’ refers to a clause which cannot form a separate sentence but which can form a 
sentence when joined with a main clause.” (p. 1452) In other words, a subordinate clause is a syntactically 
dependent clause. Such questions as the scope of negation, focusing, modality, etc. in the head clause are 
immaterial to this, as they pertain, not to syntactic, but  to semantic integration (see section 3.2 below). The 
following are all examples involving a subordinate P-clause: 
(61)  
a. 
If this is the famous London Bridge, it doesn’t come up to my expectations. 
 
 
b. 
If he is there, send him away. 
 
 
c. 
I told her if he was there to send him away. 
 
 
d. 
I told her to send him away if he was there. 
 
 
e. 
I’m always a little sad if my husband is abroad on business. 
 
 
f. 
I’ll come if I have time. 
 
 
g. 
He must be very desperate—if he went to beg money from HER! 
 
 
h. 
He’ll no doubt be late—if he turns up at all. 
Needless to say, this definition of a P-clause as a syntactically dependent clause does not apply to paratactic 
conditionals and conditionals showing cosubordination (see above). In section 11.7.2 we will draw attention 
to a further exception: there are some special sentence types in which a P-clause is used without an overt Q-
clause (e.g. If you will step inside, please). 
 
3.2. ‘Fully integrated’ clauses 
 
In what follows we will say that the if-clauses in (61a)-(61f) are ‘fully integrated’ into the head clause while 
those in (61g)-(61h), which are preceded by a break in intonation (representable by a dash or comma), are 
not. The latter will be called ‘postscript’ clauses. (In the written mode, it is not always obvious whether a P-
clause should be read as a postscript clause or not. There is no strict spelling convention as to the use of a 
comma between the two clauses of a conditional. However, we have noticed that in our corpora a P-clause 
which precedes the Q-clause and is fully integrated into it may or may not be followed by a comma [partly 
depending on its length], whereas a P-clause which follows the Q-clause and is not fully integrated into it is 
always preceded by a comma or dash.) 
It is clear from the fact that we call the P-clauses in (61a-f) ‘fully integrated’ that ‘full integration’ of a 
conditional clause into its head clause (i.e. its superordinate clause, whether that clause is itself syntactically 
embedded or not) is seen as ‘full syntactic integration’, which does not necessarily coincide with ‘full 
semantic integration’. If one uses scope criteria (such as negation, focusing or modality) to determine the 
degree of semantic integration of the adverbial—see Rutherford (1970); Quirk et al. (1985: 1071); Verstraete 
(1998)—there may be clear differences between the preposed and postposed versions of the if-clause: in 
initial position, the if-clause can never be under the scope of negation, focusing or modality in the Q-clause, 
whereas it can be when it occurs in final position. However, even postposed P-clauses are often not 
semantically integrated into the Q-clause. Thus, in He must be up to something if he asks such questions, the 

conditional clause if he asks such questions is fully integrated into the head clause syntactically, but not 
semantically. This becomes clear when we apply the criterion of scope of modality: the correct paraphrase 
for this (inferential) conditional seems to be ‘[if he asks such questions] [it is probable that he is up to 
something]’ rather than ‘it is probable that [he is up to something if he asks such questions]’. Similarly, in an 
actualization conditional like She may or may not react if he teases her, the conditional clause is not under 
the scope of the polarity or modality in the main clause. 
The following is an example of semantic integration of the P-clause: 
(62)  
It is not if I’m alone that I feel loneliest. [Actually, it’s when I form part of a crowd and nobody’s 
paying any attention to me.] 
Here it is the if-clause that is the focus both of the negation and of the specificational focusing effected by the 
cleft construction. Needless to say, semantic integration automatically entails syntactic integration. 
In sum, we will be using ‘fully integrated P-clause’ in its syntactic sense. According to this definition, 
only ‘postscript’ P-clauses are not fully integrated P-clauses. 
 
3.3. Restrictive postscript-P conditionals 
 
In a postscript-P conditional (=a conditional with a postscript P-clause), the P-clause is, syntactically, not 
fully integrated into the Q-clause. This reflects the P-clause’s discourse function of offering P as a 
‘postscript’ or afterthought. A postscript P-clause usually (but not always—consider He must be up to 
something—if he asks such questions) has a restrictive meaning: it restricts the truth or applicability of the Q-
clause a posteriori. In doing so it is normally interpreted as a necessary condition for the speaker’s 
commitment to the truth of Q or for the actualization of the Q-situation in the possible world referred to (see 
9.4). In that case we speak of a ‘restrictive postscript-P conditional’: 
(63)  
a. 
I’ll drop in and see you at 10 tonight, if you will be alone.  (QUI) (=...if you can assure me 
that you will be alone) 
 
 
b. 
You will never be able to afford such a house—unless someone bequeaths you a substantial 
sum of money. 
 
 
c. 
Roadford will long remain a challenging water with magnificent wild fish—if the present 
caring management rise to that challenge.  (COB-W) 
For the sake of simplicity, we will not distinguish between postscript if-clauses and postscript unless-clauses. 
Strictly speaking, the former are restrictive whereas the latter are exclusive—see the distinction made 
between ‘set-restricting’ and ‘subset-excluding’ P-clauses in section 3.9 below. However, excluding is an 
indirect way of restricting, and it will not prove necessary for our purposes to carefully distinguish between 
set-restricting postscript if-clauses (as in Children are orphans if they don’t have parents) and subset-
excluding postscript unless-clauses (as in Children are orphans unless they have parents). Both will 
therefore be referred to as ‘restrictive postscript P-clauses’. 
 
3.4. Actualization conditionals 
 
One way in which we can classify conditionals is according to whether or not the actualization of the P-
situation is a condition for the actualization of the Q-situation. In actualization conditionals, the P-clause (or, 
more correctly, the P-situation) can be referred to as ‘actualization-conditioning’, the Q-clause (or rather the 
Q-situation) as ‘actualization-conditioned’. We can distinguish three possibilities as to the temporal (and 
logical) relation between the two situations. Firstly, the P-situation may precede the Q-situation: 
(64)  
If you touch her, I’ll break your neck. 
Secondly, the conditioning P-situation may be simultaneous with, or overlap, the Q-situation: 
(65)  
a. 
If it rains we’ll stay at home. 
 
 
b. 
I will work for you {provided / only if} you pay me decent wages. 
Thirdly, the P-situation may follow the Q-situation. In that case it is not the P-actualization itself that 
conditions the Q-actualization, but the prospect of the P-actualization: 
(66)  
As a rule I help Kelly if she does me a favour in return. 

Kelly’s doing a favour in return is seen as a precondition for my helping her, but logically it is only the 
prospect of, or by inference (from the way bargains work and the conventions that lead us to see such a 
sentence as describing a bargain) a promise of her doing a favour in return, that conditions the actualization 
of the Q-situation. 
Precautionary and preventative in case-conditionals work in a similar way: 
(67)  
a. 
In those days Joe always carried an umbrella in case it rained. 
 
 
b. 
She locked the door of her room in case anyone should enter it [while she was away]. 
Strictly speaking, one can say that in (67a) rain was not a condition for Joe’s carrying an umbrella, but that 
the possibility or prospect of rain was the motivation for his doing so. 
Actualization conditionals will be further examined in section 9.1. We will make a distinction there 
between ‘actualization-triggering’ P-clauses (e.g. If it rains we’ll stay at home), ‘actualization-licensing’ P-
clauses (e.g. I could open the door if I had the key), ‘preclusive’ P-clauses such as the if-clause of If it rains, 
we won’t go to the seaside (=rain will preclude our going to the seaside), ‘nonpreclusive’ P-clauses like If it 
rains, we’ll still go to the seaside (=rain will not preclude our going to the seaside), and in case P-clauses. 
 
3.5. ‘(Non)assertoric’ vs ‘(non)assertive’ clauses 
 
We will use these terms in the following way. A clause is ‘assertoric’ if it realizes the illocutionary act (in the 
sense of Searle [1969]) of making an assertion (statement)—see also Woods (1997: 4). Otherwise (e.g. if it 
expresses a directive or an open question) it is ‘nonassertoric’. A clause is ‘assertive’ when the message (but 
not necessarily the form) of the clause is that of an affirmative assertion. Otherwise (i.e. when the message is 
negative and/or interrogative) it is nonassertive. Only nonassertive clauses can contain nonassertive items 
(‘negative polarity items’). Thus, a negative assertion like I haven’t any cakes left is assertoric but 
nonassertive—hence the use of the nonassertive item any. 
A clause expressing a directive (imperative, command) is by definition nonassertoric: uttering an order or 
request is a different illocutionary act from making an assertion. An interrogative sentence is nonassertoric 
and nonassertive if it expresses an ‘open question’, i.e. a question asking for information (e.g. Do you have 
any cakes left?). However, an interrogative clause is assertoric (i.e. makes an assertion) in the following 
cases. (None of these cases concerns question tags: because these are never added to interrogative clauses, 
they are irrelevant to the question of whether an interrogative Q-clause can be assertoric.) Firstly, an 
interrogative clause is assertoric if it is a ‘rhetorical question’, i.e. a sentence that has the form of a question 
but is interpreted as a forceful statement: 
(68)  
a. 
If you can’t do it, who can?  (interpreted as ‘If you can’t do it, nobody can’) 
 
 
b. 
If you know the truth, why don’t you say something?  (interpreted as ‘...you should say 
something’) 
 
 
c. 
If he was there, need that mean he was the murderer?  (=‘...surely, that need not mean that...’) 
As a rule, an interrogative sentence expressing a rhetorical question is nonassertive when it is affirmative and 
assertive if it is negative. Thus, Who shall say that he is wrong? is interpreted as ‘Nobody will say that he is 
wrong’, which is nonassertive, while Why did you not say something? is interpreted as ‘You should have said 
something’, in which something is an assertive item (positive polarity item). 
Secondly, an interrogative clause is assertoric if it expresses a ‘yes/no question’ (polar question) that is 
interpreted as an assertion followed by a question tag asking for confirmation: 
(69)  
a. 
If yoghourt is good for my stomach, shouldn’t I eat it more often?  (=I should eat it more 
often, shouldn’t I?) 
 
 
b. 
If this is Tuesday, haven’t you received a letter from John?  (In order to interpret this, we need 
to build a context in which the speaker expects John to have written a letter and sent it in time 
to arrive by Tuesday, or a context in which the speaker knows that the addressee always 
receives a letter from John on Tuesdays. In such a context, the speaker can infer from the 
premise that it is Tuesday, along with other background premises, that the addressee has 
received a letter from John. The sentence is therefore equivalent to ‘If this is Tuesday, you 
have received a letter from John, haven’t you?’) 

As far as interpretation is concerned, the Q-clause of such a conditional is similar to a ‘declarative question’, 
i.e. a question that has the form of a declarative sentence (=statement): 
(70)  
a. 
If you command all these people, you’re the ‘captain’?  (=My conclusion is that you are the 
‘captain’. Is that correct?) 
 
 
b. 
If it’s Tuesday, this must be Brussels? 
While rhetorical questions are ‘strongly assertoric’, because they are interpreted as forceful statements, the 
second type is ‘weakly assertoric’, because the assertion is made with some doubt, so that the speaker deems 
it necessary to ask for confirmation. 
A final point about nonassertoric clauses is that they do not have a truth value, and can therefore not be 
seen as the expression of a proposition. 
 
3.6. Inferential conditionals 
 
Another way in which we may classify conditionals is to divide them into inferential and noninferential 
conditionals. A conditional is an inferential if it expresses an inference from one proposition to another. (The 
latter proposition thus expresses an epistemically possible or necessary conclusion.) Unlike what we observe 
in actualization conditionals, the conditional link is not between the actualization of situations but between 
the validity of propositions. We can distinguish between the following subtypes: 
 
3.6.1. Direct inferentials 
 
These are conditionals that represent a process of reasoning of the type ‘If P is true, Q is true’ in which the P-
clause is ‘premise-expressing’ and the Q-clause asserts the conclusion which the speaker draws from P. (It 
should be clear that the conclusion is based not only on P but also on contextual or pragmatic knowledge 
shared by the speaker or hearer—see also Ramsey [1978: 144]. However, P is the most relevant premise in 
the discourse, as it is the only one that is explicitly mentioned.) 
(71)  
a. 
If he has not arrived yet, he {has had / must have had / may have had} an accident.  (The 
conclusion here concerns the epistemic necessity or possibility of the truth of Q.) 
 
 
b. 
If yoghurt is good for my stomach I {must / should} eat it more often.  (Here the Q-clause 
expresses an epistemically necessary conclusion concerning the deontic necessity for the 
speaker to perform the Q-situation.) 
 
 
c. 
[You realize what you’re saying, don’t you?] If your step-father HAS been murdered; if he was 
murdered BEFORE the theft of the knife, then your mother is under far more suspicion, not less.  
(DOC) 
It is important to see that we should not conflate the terms ‘inferential’ and ‘epistemic’. All inferential 
conditionals are epistemic, but not vice versa. If the Q-clause is an interrogative clause containing an 
epistemic auxiliary (e.g. If he’s not at home, could he be in the pub?), the conditional is not a direct 
inferential, except if the interrogative Q-clause is interpreted as assertoric, e.g. If he’s not at home, need that 
mean he’s in the pub? (=‘...surely, that needn’t mean that he’s in the pub). A conditional is a direct 
inferential only if the P-clause expresses a premise and the Q-clause asserts the conclusion drawn from it. 
Conditionals with a nonassertoric Q-clause are never inferential—see also section 4.2.4. Thus, the following 
are not inferentials, because the Q-questions are not assertoric but ‘open questions’, just asking for 
information: 
(72)  
a. 
If this is Tuesday, where are we now? 
 
 
b. 
If it’s too late to drive home now, will we have to look for an hotel? 
Here the if-clauses offer what could be a premise from which a conclusion is drawn, but the Q-clauses do not 
express any conclusion (inference): they simply ask for information. In section 10.1.5, such conditionals will 
be called ‘nonassertoric-Q utterance conditionals’. The P-clause of these conditionals (which are ‘rhetorical’ 
conditionals) expresses either a felicity condition for the Q-utterance or, as in (72a-b), what induces the 
speaker to utter the Q-clause. This means that we do not accept a speech-act analysis of such inferentials, as 
is proposed by Sweetser (1990): we agree that (72a-b) are “speech-act conditionals” (=utterance 
conditionals), but do not accept that such conditionals (expressing ‘P induces me to perform the speech act of 

asking the question expressed in the head clause’) are inferentials. A conditional is a direct inferential only if 
the P-clause expresses a premise and the Q-clause asserts the conclusion drawn from it: it is a conditional of 
the type ‘If P, Q’, in which Q is a proposition (with a truth value)—see also section 4.2.4. 
For a full discussion of direct inferential conditionals, see section 9.2. 
 
3.6.2. Indirect inferentials 
 
Whereas in direct inferential conditionals, P is the premise underlying an inference about the truth of Q, there 
are also inferentials where the inference goes from Q to P. The communicative purpose of such ‘indirect’ 
inferentials is to make the hearer draw an inference about the truth of P. This inference is indirect in that the 
conclusion is not explicitly asserted, but is to be inferred from Q and the conditional sentence as a whole. 
More specifically, the reasoning is that P must be false because it is presented as leading to a Q-conclusion 
which the speaker treats as patently false. Clear examples of such indirect inferentials are what we will call 
‘ad absurdum’ inferentials. Compare: 
(73)  
a. 
If he is the general manager, he is the one we should try to speak to. 
 
 
b. 
If he is the general manager, I am Shakespeare! 
The former sentence is a direct inferential: the speaker infers that if P is true, Q must be true too. The latter 
example illustrates the ‘ad absurdum’ type: the initial inference from P to Q is immediately seen to stand in 
need of qualification because of the absurdity of Q; the speaker then expects the hearer to draw an inference 
from the pragmatically obvious nontruth of Q to the speaker’s rejection of the truth of P. This kind of 
conditional is often called ‘ad absurdum’ because it exhibits a kind of reasoning (‘P must be as absurd as Q’) 
which is similar to the ‘reductio ad absurdum’ argument in mathematics, which disproves a theorem by 
showing that it leads to absurd consequences. 
However, there are other types of indirect inferentials besides the ‘ad absurdum’ type. One possibility is 
that the verb form of the Q-clause represents Q as counterfactual (=contrary to fact, incompatible with the 
actual world), so that P, whose verb form does not normally express counterfactuality, is also interpreted as 
counterfactual: 
(74)  
a. 
If my mother-in-law was coming tomorrow, I would have spent all day cleaning the house. 
 
 
b. 
If (as you say) he really fought in Vietnam for three years, he would {know / have known} a 
lot about warfare. 
These conditionals have a counterfactual-Q interpretation on which one could add to (74a) ‘but he {is / has}’ and to 
(74b) ‘but he doesn’t’. The counterfactuality of Q—or, more correctly, the speaker’s assumption of the 
counterfactuality of Q—is signalled by the use of the conditional tense or conditional perfect in the Q-clause. 
The fact that Q (whether [+q] or [-q]) is thus represented as false in the actual world forces the hearer to infer 
that P (which leads to Q) must also be counterfactual, although its verb form does not represent it as such: for 
the sake of the argument, the speaker purports to represent P as ‘closed’ (=assumed to be true, as is claimed 
or suggested in the preceding context), but then she makes it clear that this interpretation must be 
reconsidered. As in ad absurdum inferentials, the P-clauses of these examples are typically echoic. 
In another type of indirect inferential the Q-clause is not pragmatically absurd or grammatically marked 
as counterfactual but is contradictory, i.e. semantically anomalous (at least in isolation): 
(75)  
But Superman wouldn’t be Superman if he let this kind of injustice happen. 
Here the only possible conclusion from the semantic anomaly of the Q-proposition (‘Superman not be 
Superman’) is that P cannot be true. 
In the following examples the Q-clauses are interrogative clauses: 
(76)  
a. 
And I feel that if I don’t do it, being in a relatively powerful position, who the hell else is 
going to?  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
If John is so clever (as you claim), how come he isn’t rich? 
 
 
c. 
If John is so clever (as you claim), why is he so poor? 
In (76a) the Q-clause is interpreted as a rhetorical question, meaning ‘nobody else is going to do it.’ The use 
of who the hell makes it clear that the speaker considers this eventuality (=no one doing it) as unacceptable—
something that should be treated as not possible in her morally acceptable actual world. This (weak) sense of 

counterfactuality of Q prompts the hearer to conclude that P (‘I don’t do it’) should be rejected as false in 
that world. Sentences (76b-c) receive similar interpretations. Examples like (76a-c) differ from many other 
cases of indirect inferentials in that the relevant Q-proposition, which is either [-q] (e.g. He is not rich) or 
[+q] (e.g. He is so poor), is not counterfactual. However, as in all the other cases, the speaker obviously 
treats Q as incompatible with P. In her opinion, P cannot be true (factual) if Q is. The (assumed) factuality of 
Q therefore leads her to conclude that P must be false. 
 
3.7. Implicative conditionals 
 
Another way of classifying conditionals is according to whether or not they are ‘implicative conditionals’. As 
will become clear, the way we use this term has nothing to do with the ‘material implication’ of logic. We do 
not wish to take a position in the discussion of whether or not implicative conditionals express ‘material 
implication’—see e.g. Gibbard (1981) and Kratzer (1986). By ‘implicative’ we mean the conditionals in 
which the link between P and Q concerns the way in which, and whether, the actualization of the P-situation affects the 
likelihood of the Q-situation to actualize (or to be the case or to have actualized), or the truth of the P-situation affects 
the likelihood of the Q-proposition to be true, or the actualization or truth of the Q-situation or Q-proposition similarly 
affects the actualization or truth of the P-situation. That is, implicative conditionals are conditionals in which there is a 
kind of causal, resultative, licensing, preclusive or specifically nonpreclusive link between P and Q or 
between Q and P. The following illustrate each of these sorts of links between a P-situation and a Q-
situation: 
(77)  
a. 
If it rains a lot, the ground will become waterlogged.  (causal link) 
 
 
b. 
If you tell him the truth, he won’t trust us any more.  (resultative link) 
 
 
c. 
If we had a little more rain in this area we could grow rice.  (licensing link: [+p] would render 
[+q] possible) 
 
 
d. 
I won’t enjoy the trip if Myriam comes too.  (preclusive link: ‘[+p] will prevent [+q]’) 
 
 
e. 
If he’s caught red-handed, he’ll still deny everything.  (nonpreclusive link: ‘[+p] will not 
prevent [+q]’) 
We have already mentioned some of these sorts of links in our brief look at actualization conditionals in 
section 3.4. Actualization conditionals are always implicative. However, the category of implicative 
conditionals also includes all inferential conditionals. For example: 
(78)  
a. 
If she’s not here yet, she’s stuck in the traffic.  (There is a {causal / licensing / resultative} link 
between knowledge of P and the conclusion that Q—see also Sweetser 1990.) 
 
 
b. 
If she’s escaped from the camp—which we don’t know yet for certain—she’s much cleverer 
than we thought.  (There is a {causal / licensing / resultative} link between the supposition 
that P and the conclusion that Q.) 
 
 
c. 
“If Deirdre is guilty, I’m a banana,” said Emily.  (COB-W)  (There is both an ostensible 
inferential causal link going from P to Q—the assumption that Deirdre is guilty ostensibly 
causes the speaker to conclude that she herself is a banana—and a prompt to the hearer to 
make an inferential causal link going from Q to P: since Q is patently absurd, P must also be 
absurd.) 
The following is an example of a nonimplicative conditional: 
(79)  
If you should need me, I’ll be in the garden. 
Here, the P-situation of your needing me does not cause, result in, or license the Q-situation of my being in 
the garden, nor does the conditional convey the message that the P-situation precludes or does not preclude 
my being in the garden. (World-knowledge, of course, tells us that P does not preclude Q, but this is not the 
message of the conditional, as it is in If he’s caught red-handed, he’ll still deny everything.) 
In sum, the category of implicative conditionals comprises both actualization conditionals and inferential 
conditionals. The main reason for having this ‘higher’ category, so to speak, is that certain generalizations 
apply to all implicative conditionals—see, for example, the discussion of even if in chapter 14, or the 
discussion of the origins of necessity and/or sufficiency understandings in section 12.4.2. We might note, 
too, though, that it is not always possible to make an absolute distinction between actualization conditionals 

and inferentials. Although there are sentences that clearly belong to the one type or the other, a great many 
implicative conditionals allow the two interpretations. Consider: 
(80)  
a. 
If Peter didn’t write this letter, someone else did.  (purely inferential) 
 
 
b. 
[Those were the happy days.] If you had an accident, the whole village came to your 
assistance.  (actualization-triggering-P) 
 
 
c. 
If she has fallen out with him, his family will take revenge on her.  (There is an inferential 
reading—’I infer from the truth of P that I can confidently predict Q’—as well as an 
actualization-triggering-P reading—’Her falling out with him will trigger an act of revenge 
on the part of his family.’) 
 
 
d. 
If you both work, then both your salaries will be taken into consideration when the lender 
arranges your mortgage.  (COB-W) (either inferential or actualization-triggering-P) 
 
3.8. Case-specifying-P conditionals 
 
Here we are looking at a more abstract parameter for subcategorizing conditionals. This parameter concerns 
a particular kind of semantic relation between P and Q which often determines the meaning of the 
conditional as a whole. On the basis of the meaning of the P-clause and its contribution to the meaning of the 
conditional, we can distinguish between ‘case-specifying’ and ‘non-case-specifying’ P-clauses. A conditional 
is ‘case-specifying-P’ if the P-clause specifies a case or the case(s) in which the Q-situation actualizes or in 
which the Q-proposition applies. In other words, a case-specifying conditional implies (in the every-day 
sense of the word, not in a sense related to our definition of ‘implicative’ conditionals) that whether or not Q 
is the case depends, in some way, on whether P is or is not the case. Within the class of case-specifying-P 
conditionals we can distinguish the following subtypes: 
 
3.8.1. Purely case-specifying-P conditionals 
 
In this subtype, the P-clause just specifies a case or the case(s) in which (or the circumstances under which) 
Q is true or the Q-situation actualizes. The case-specifying P-clause is neither premise-expressing nor 
actualization-conditioning. (In other words, a purely case-specifying-P conditional is neither an inferential 
nor an actualization conditional. This means that the conditional is not an ‘implicative’ conditional—see 
section 3.7 above—because there is no causal, resultative, licensing, preclusive or specifically nonpreclusive 
link between P and Q.) 
(81)  
a. 
If you were shot at, this bullet-proof jacket would protect you.  (The P-clause has no other 
function than to identify the case[s] in which the jacket proves to be protecting.) 
 
 
b. 
[We teach our pupils some theoretical linguistic concepts.] This is quite useful to them if they 
later specialize in linguistics rather than literature. 
 
 
c. 
If I was thirsty I bought myself a drink in the canteen. 
 
3.8.2. Actualization conditionals 
 
In this type of (implicative) conditional the P-clause is case-specifying in the sense that it specifies a case or 
the case(s) in which (or the circumstances under which) the Q-situation actualizes or fails to actualize. 
(82)  
a. 
If he comes here, I {will / won’t} tell him off. 
 
 
b. 
I’ll only do it if I’m paid for it. 
 
3.8.3. Direct inferentials 
 
These are conditionals (of the implicative type) in which the P-clause is case-specifying in the sense that it 
specifies a case or the case(s) in which the conclusion that Q is true is warranted. 
(83)  
a. 
If you’re going to repair the roof, you’ll need a ladder. 
 
 
b. 
If Bill has an alibi, he can’t be the culprit. 

Now that we have defined and illustrated case-specifying-P conditionals, it may be useful to give a couple of 
examples of conditionals that are not case-specifying-P (and which, in chapter 10, will be referred to as 
‘rhetorical conditionals’): 
(84)  
a. 
[Ronald stopped pouring the sherry to go and greet his brother, who appeared in the doorway 
of the library a moment later.] If Ronald was tall, his brother was a giant. 
 
 
b. 
If he was not rich, at least he was not destitute. 
In case-specifying conditionals the P-clause in some way restricts the cases in which the speaker is 
committed to the truth or applicability of the predication made in Q. This is not the case in (84a) and (84b). 
Although it might be claimed that (84a) literally means In the case that (I accept that / it is assumed to be 
true that) Ronald was tall, then his brother was a giant, we would argue that on the normal understanding of 
this sentence, the P-clause does not specify a case, or the cases, in which Ronald’s brother was a giant. 
Rather, the speaker simply makes a comparison between two situations, both of which are presented as true. 
 
3.9. Set-identifying P-clauses 
 
In the chapters which follow, we will need to refer to ‘set-identifying P-clauses’. These are, in fact, a subtype of the 
purely case-specifying P-clauses referred to above, and will be dealt with in more detail in section 9.3. In set-
identifying-P conditionals, the P-clause specifies the cases in which Q is claimed to be true by restricting the 
scope of the Q-predication to a subset of a plural set referred to or implied in the Q-clause. For example, in 
Children are orphans if their parents are dead, the if-clause restricts the scope of the Q-predication to a 
subset of the generic set of children. For this reason, the sentence is virtually synonymous with Children 
whose parents are dead are orphans. As we will see in section 9.3.2.4, there are two kinds of set-identifying 
P-clauses, depending on whether the conjunction is if or unless. In the former case, the set is directly 
restricted by the if-clause, so that we can speak of ‘set-restricting’ P-clauses. When unless is used, the set is 
indirectly restricted by the exclusion of a subset. For example, in Lions are dangerous unless they aren’t 
hungry, the set of lions that are dangerous is restricted by excluding lions that are not hungry. In this case we 
can speak of a ‘subset-excluding’ P-clause. The following are some further examples of the two types of set-
identifying-P conditionals: 
(85)  
a. 
In those days people were discriminated against if they were lepers.  (set-restricting) 
 
 
b. 
In those days people were not discriminated against unless they were lepers.  (subset-
excluding) 
 
 
c. 
People burn instead of tanning if they have a white, freckled skin.  (set-restricting) (Compare: 
People who have a white, freckled skin burn instead of tanning.) 
 
 
d. 
A man is little use if his wife is a widow.  (Scottish proverb)  (set-restricting) (Compare: Men 
whose wives are widows are of little use.) 
 
 
e. 
Three may keep a secret if two of them are dead.  (DOC) (set-restricting on the reading 
‘Those threesomes may keep a secret of whom two are dead’) 
 
3.10. Conditionals and possible worlds 
 
The type of possible world to which a conditional refers is an important parameter in its description. It is the 
type of possible world referred to which in large measure determines the use of tenses and modal auxiliaries 
in a conditional. We will investigate the question of possible worlds in more detail in chapter 4. At this point 
we will restrict ourselves to giving the main outlines of the possible-world categorization. Since not all non-
case-specifying P-clauses set up the possible world in which Q is valid (e.g. He can’t be more than twenty, if 
[he’s] that), we will concentrate on case-specifying-P conditionals, where it is as a rule the P-clause that 
determines the possible world in relation to which Q should be interpreted. 
 
3.10.1. Factual versus theoretical P-clauses 
 
Case-specifying-P conditionals refer to a possible world. On the basis of whether or not this world is the 
actual world, we can distinguish between ‘factual’ P-clauses and ‘theoretical’ (or ‘nonfactual’) P-clauses. 
Factual P-clauses refer to situations that form part of the actual world (i.e. its present state and history), while 
theoretical P-clauses refer to situations that only exist in the mind of the speaker. In other words, a factual P-

clause refers to a situation that has actualized or is actualizing in the real world, while a theoretical P-clause 
just makes a theoretical assumption about a situation, that is, a supposition about a situation in a theoretical 
(nonfactual) world. (Dudman [1991] speaks of a “fantasy”.) In factual-P conditionals the speaker commits 
herself to the truth of P in the real world, whereas in theoretical-P conditionals she does not: 
(86)  
a. 
If I had a problem, I always went to my grandmother.  (factual-P) 
 
 
b. 
[“Won’t you come in?”] — “Don’t be disappointed if I say no. [There’s someone waiting for 
me at my office].”  (The P-clause is factual if it is performative: in that case, it is by uttering 
‘if I say no’ that the speaker performs the illocutionary speech act of declining the invitation.) 
 
 
c. 
If he has a problem, he’s probably gone to his grandmother.  (theoretical-P) 
 
 
d. 
[“Won’t you come in?”] — “What would you say if I said no?”  (theoretical-P) 
 
 
e. 
[Our insurance policies are simply the best.] If you have an accident, of whatever kind, you 
can be sure we will pay up in less than no time.  (theoretical-P) 
 
 
f. 
If she comes, I will be very happy to see her again.  (theoretical-P) 
One might argue that ‘nonfactual’ is a better term than ‘theoretical’, because factual-P conditionals are not 
intuitively nontheoretical or atheoretical. However, the reason why we will generally use ‘theoretical’ rather 
than ‘nonfactual’ (although we do consider the two terms to be synonyms) is that in the literature 
“nonfactual” is often equated with ‘counterfactual’. As will be stressed in section 3.11, we make a careful 
distinction between ‘nonfactual’ and ‘counterfactual’. The latter term means ‘incompatible with the actual 
world’. Thus, the conditional I would appreciate it if you would do this for me refers to a nonfactual future 
world, which may or may not turn out to develop into the actual world, whereas I would have appreciated it 
if you had done this for me refers to a counterfactual world. 
It should also be noted that our use of ‘theoretical’ is different from that of Leech (1971: 111) and 
Dancygier & Mioduszewska (1984: 128-129), who use it in the sense of our ‘open-P’—see section 3.10.3.2 
below. 
Within the class of theoretical case-specifying P-clauses, further semantic distinctions can be made on the 
basis of the kind of supposition that is created by the P-clause (i.e. the kind of ‘world’ that is evoked by the 
P-clause). 
 
3.10.2. Neutral versus nonneutral theoretical P-clauses 
 
The supposition expressed by a theoretical P-clause may be ‘neutral’ or ‘nonneutral’. It is neutral if it is no 
more than a pure supposition. It is nonneutral if it is a supposition accompanied by a presupposition 
(assumption) about the relation of compatibility between the supposed world and the actual world. Treating 
the assumption accompanying nonneutral theoretical P-clauses as a presupposition is in keeping with 
Givón’s (1995: 114) definition of presupposition as a “proposition [which] is assumed to be true” and with 
the well-known property of presuppositions that they remain unaffected under nonmetalinguistic sentence 
negation:7 not only If Bill comes, he will learn the truth but also If Bill doesn’t come, he won’t learn the 
truth presupposes the truth of the proposition ‘Bill may come.’ (The idea of may follows from the fact that 
the condition is an ‘open’ one, i.e. a condition that may or may not be fulfilled—see section 3.10.3.2 below.) 
The following are examples of nonneutral-P conditionals: 
(87)  
a. 
If, as has just been claimed, the river will rise as high as this, our meadows will be flooded.  
(nonneutral-P: the speaker assumes that the claim that has just been made is true; the 
conclusion expressed in the Q-clause is based on this assumption.) 
 
 
b. 
If John had been careful, this would never have happened.  (nonneutral-P: the P-clause 
presupposes that the P-proposition ‘John was careful’ is false [counterfactual].) 
                                              
7. 
Metalinguistic negation is external (wide scope) negation in which the speaker rejects the truth of a contextually 
given statement as a whole. This is the case in the head clause of The King of France is not bald because there is 
no King of France. Here the speaker rejects the truth of the sentence The King of France is bald on the basis of the 
fact that a presupposition for the truth of this sentence (viz. that there must be a King of France) is not satisfied. 
Obviously, the claim that presuppositions are not affected by sentence negation is true only if the negation in 
question is not metalinguistic. 

A theoretical P-clause is ‘neutral’ if it is no more than a pure supposition, i.e. if nothing is said or implied 
concerning the (in)compatibility of the P-world with the actual world. Typical examples of this are 
‘imaginary-P’ conditionals. These are ‘irrealis’ conditionals in which the P-clause is not counterfactual 
(incompatible with the actual world) but purely suppositional, i.e. referring to a theoretical (nonfactual) 
world which does not suggest any kind of truth relation with the propositions making up the actual world—
see also sections 3.11 and 13.3. 
(88)  
In your place I would have been happy if I had got a first.  (This implies neither ‘I did not get a 
first’ nor ‘I got a first’, and neither ‘I {was / am} not happy’ nor ‘I {was / am} happy’. It is therefore 
an imaginary-P conditional.) 
It is also important to see the difference between imaginary-P conditionals and imaginary-Q conditionals. In 
the former, both P and Q are imaginary, as in the above examples. In the latter, Q is imaginary while P is 
counterfactual: 
(89)  
If I had your genes, I would have curly hair.  (counterfactual P: P runs counter to the actual world; 
imaginary Q: Q may or may not be true in the actual world, i.e. the speaker may or may not have 
curly hair herself.) 
 
3.10.3. Types of nonneutral theoretical P-clauses 
 
When the case-specifying P-clause has nonneutral theoretical meaning, four possibilities can be 
distinguished, depending on the assumed truth relation between the supposed possible world and the actual 
world: nonneutral suppositions may be ‘closed’, ‘open’, ‘tentative’ or ‘counterfactual’. 
 
3.10.3.1. Closed-P conditionals 
 
The supposition P is ‘closed’ if it is given in the context and the speaker assumes (at least ostensibly) that P 
is true: 
(90)  
a. 
If, as you say, John will come here himself tomorrow, we’d better not dispatch this letter to 
him but invite him to have a talk with us.  (The speaker accepts the truth of the claim that 
John will come tomorrow.) 
 
 
b. 
[“Bill is Mary’s nephew.” — “Well, well.] If Bill is Mary’s nephew, he’s a distant relative of 
mine, [for I’m Mary’s great-niece].”  (The speaker assumes that the claim that Bill is Mary’s 
nephew is correct.) 
It is typical of closed-P conditionals that the P-clause is echoic in one sense or another (see section 4.2.4.3). 
In one type of ‘indirect inferential’ (see section 3.6.2 above), a closed P-clause is used under false 
pretences: 
(91)  
If Ted’s so clever, why isn’t he rich? 
There are two closed-P interpretations here. The speaker may be genuinely asking for an explanation as to 
why two things (being clever and not being rich) which, in her view of the real world, do not normally go 
together, do apparently coincide in the case of Ted. However, the sentence can also be used if the speaker has 
her doubts about the truth of P, but the addressee (or someone else in the context) apparently does not: the 
latter presents P as true. In that case the conditional is meant to disprove the truth of P by showing that P 
would lead to consequences which (in the speaker’s view of the actual world) are incompatible with P. The 
speaker thus builds an indirect inferential, starting with a P-clause which ‘echoes’ a claim presented as true 
by the hearer (or some other source) and which is ostensibly closed (=accepted by the speaker). However, the 
speaker does so for the sake of the argument only; the interpretation she eventually wants to convey is that 
(for her) P is not true at all. 
 
3.10.3.2. Open-P conditionals 
 
The supposition is ‘open’ if the speaker treats fulfilment of the supposition as uncertain, but as a real 
possibility: 

(92)  
a. 
I will be happy if we find a solution. 
 
 
b. 
[I hope Liverpool won their home match yesterday.] If they did, they still have a chance of 
winning the championship. 
 
3.10.3.3. Tentative-P conditionals 
 
The supposition is ‘tentative’ if the speaker treats fulfilment of the supposition as a rather unlikely or 
otherwise tentative possibility: 
(93)  
a. 
I would be happy if we found a solution. 
 
 
b. 
If John were to do that, he would be severely punished. 
 
 
c. 
I would appreciate it if you didn’t mention this to my wife.  (The tentative-P pattern is used 
here for politeness.) 
 
3.10.3.4. Counterfactual-P conditionals 
 
The supposition is ‘counterfactual’ if the speaker presupposes that it is false in the real world, i.e. contrary to 
fact: 
(94)  
a. 
I would have been happy if we had found a solution. 
 
 
b. 
If he were here, he would stop you from doing that. 
 
3.11. Irrealis, nonfactual, counterfactual and imaginary P-clauses 
 
Summing up section 3.10, we can say that case-specifying P-clauses can be classified semantically on the 
basis of the following parameters: (a) factual or theoretical meaning; (b) if theoretical: neutral or nonneutral 
supposition; (c) if nonneutral: closed, open, tentative or counterfactual supposition. In order to avoid any 
misunderstanding, it may be useful to emphasize the distinction between the terms ‘nonfactual’, ‘irrealis’, 
‘counterfactual’, and ‘imaginary’. 
As we have seen, the suppositional world evoked by a case-specifying P-clause is either the real world or 
a ‘theoretical’ world. Theoretical worlds can also be called ‘nonfactual’. The latter term should therefore be 
carefully distinguished from ‘counterfactual’. All counterfactual P-clauses have a nonfactual meaning, but 
not all nonfactuals are counterfactuals. 
It is also necessary to make a clear distinction between ‘irrealis’, ‘counterfactual’ and ‘imaginary’. In the 
literature, “irrealis” is sometimes used in the sense of ‘counterfactual’, but it usually also covers tentative-P 
conditionals. The term “imaginary” is mostly equated with ‘counterfactual’. Thus, James (1986: 462) speaks 
of “purely imagined states of affairs” to refer to what we call counterfactual situations. Fauconnier (1996) 
does so too: “a counterfactual sets up an imaginary situation which differs from the actual one in one 
fundamental respect, expressed in the antecedent part (A, the protasis) of the if A then B construction.” (p. 
58) 
In this book the three terms will be used in the following way. A conditional has ‘irrealis’ meaning in two 
cases: (a) if it is a counterfactual-P conditional (referring to a world which is represented as being definitely 
different from the actual world); and (b) if it is an imaginary-P conditional, i.e. a conditional which has the 
form of a counterfactual-P conditional but is interpreted as neither counterfactual nor noncounterfactual, i.e. 
if it is interpreted as having no truth relations to the actual world at all. An example of the imaginary-P type 
is In your place I wouldn’t have helped him unless he had paid me for it, which tells us nothing about 
whether, in the actual world, I helped him or not. 
In sum, irrealis conditionals are either ‘counterfactual-P’ or ‘imaginary-P’. These two possibilities are 
further illustrated by the following examples, respectively: 
(95)  
a. 
I wouldn’t have gone to his house if he hadn’t invited me.  (implies ‘I went to his house’ and 
‘he had invited me’) 
 
 
b. 
In your place I wouldn’t have gone to his house if he hadn’t invited me.  (implies neither ‘I 
went to his house’ nor ‘I didn’t go to his house’ and neither ‘he had invited me’ nor ‘he hadn’t 
invited me’) 

Sentence (95a) is a counterfactual-P conditional. Such a conditional refers to a P-world (described by a set of 
propositions) which is presented as known to be contrary to the actual world. By contrast, sentence (95b) is 
an imaginary-P conditional. Such a conditional refers to a P-world which is only presented as existing in the 
imagination of the speaker (and which the addressee is invited also to imagine). This means that it refers to a 
world of propositions which are not represented as being truth-conditionally related to the propositions 
describing the actual world (regardless of any inferences about the actual world that might be drawn from the 
utterance of the conditional). In other words, counterfactual-P and imaginary-P conditionals are similar in 
that the imagination is involved in both cases, but differ in the following respect. Propositions describing an 
imaginary P-world are not represented as having any particular truth relationship with the propositions 
describing the actual world—for this reason imaginary-P conditionals form one type of neutral-P conditional 
(see section 4.2.2)—whilst in a counterfactual-P conditional the world imagined is represented as being 
‘negatively’ related to the actual world, in that it is explicitly different from (i.e. contrary to) it. This 
distinction will be discussed at greater length and will be further illustrated in section 4.2. 
A conditional which is not an irrealis conditional refers to a P-world which is represented as having 
varying degrees of likelihood of matching the present or past actual world or the actual world as it will turn 
out to be. As we have seen, nonirrealis conditionals may be factual-P, neutral-P, closed-P, open-P or 
tentative-P. (It is important to see that our distinction between irrealis and nonirrealis has nothing to do with 
the distinction “irrealis” vs “realis” which is often made in the literature. “Realis” covers factual-P, and 
possibly closed-P, only. Our ‘nonirrealis’, by contrast, covers any possible-world type which is not irrealis, 
where ‘irrealis’ means either counterfactual-P or imaginary-P, as defined above.) 
 
3.12. Pseudo-Q conditionals 
 
In this type, the Q-clause of the ‘if P, Q’ conditional is not the overt head clause but a covert clause. The 
overt clause is a pseudo-Q-clause which is actually interpreted as a subclause giving the reason for the 
implicit Q. For example: 
(96)  
[And I would like to say this on behalf of all happy housewives listening in—namely we feel sure 
you both have all the excellent qualities needed to keep your ship of marriage away from the rocks 
of disillusion. And also that] even if you do get fed up in a few years’ time you can always seek 
marriage guidance and advice from your fellow citizens.  (HOW) 
At first sight this sentence resists the normal analysis of an even if-conditional (see 14.1.1), as it cannot be 
interpreted as ‘You might expect that if you do get fed up [with marriage] in a few years’ time you could not 
seek marriage guidance and advice from your fellow citizens, but that expectation is wrong.’ But all 
problems of analysis disappear once it is seen that (96) is interpreted as a quite normal implicative 
conditional such as (97a) or (97b): 
(97)  
a. 
(Even) if you do get fed up in a few years’ time, you can still save your marriage because you 
can always seek marriage guidance and advice from your fellow citizens. 
 
 
b. 
(Even) if you do get fed up in a few years’ time, you can always seek marriage guidance and 
advice from your fellow citizens, so you can still save your marriage. 
Similarly: 
(98)  
a. 
[Things at last seem to be looking up for the thousands of long-suffering State Building 
Society depositors.] Even if the present scheme falls through—which now seems unlikely—
there is a City merchant bank now waiting quietly on the sidelines with an alternative scheme 
in its pocket.  (LOB) 
 
 
b. 
If they attack us, we’re waiting for them. 
These are interpreted along the lines of: 
(99)  
a. 
(Even) if the present scheme falls through—which now seems unlikely—there will still be 
hope for them because there is a City merchant bank now waiting quietly on the sidelines with 
an alternative scheme in its pocket. 
 
 
b. 
If they attack us they will not take us by surprise, because we are waiting for them. (Or: If they 
attack us, we are waiting for them. So they will not take us by surprise.) 

Pseudo-Q conditionals always have a case-specifying P-clause. Moreover, they are always interpreted as 
purely case-specifying-P conditionals (see section 3.8.1 above), never as inferentials or as actualization 
conditionals. (It is the latter characteristic that renders pseudo-Q conditionals identifiable: at first sight they 
look like implicative conditionals, but on closer inspection they cannot be interpreted as inferentials or as 
actualization conditionals.) 
 
3.13. ‘Denied conditionals’ vs ‘conditioned denials’ 
 
As already explained in section 1.3.4, the use of not (or never) in the Q-clause is usually interpreted as wide 
scope negation of q. In that case not negates neither p nor the relation (e.g. inference) between p and q. Thus, 
both If she’s there, he {can’t be / isn’t} far away and He {can’t be / isn’t} far away if she’s there are 
interpreted as ‘[+p] leads us to infer [-q].’ These sentences are therefore examples of ‘conditioned denials’, 
i.e. denials of [+q] under condition P. The same is true if the negator (not / never) in the Q-clause has narrow 
scope over a particular (accented) constituent of the Q-clause, which is therefore automatically interpreted 
‘specificationally’, and hence contrastively. (In section 3.14 below we will see that a sentence is 
‘specificational’ if it is a focusing sentence specifying a ‘value’ for a ‘variable’, as in It was Bill who left first 
or BILL left first, where ‘the x who left first’ and Bill represent the variable and the value, respectively.) 
(100) 
 
a. 
BILL didn’t help her if she needed help [but JOHN did].  (=If she needed help, it was not 
Bill who helped her [but John].) 
 
 
b. 
It won’t make her ANGRY if you tell her the truth—[it’ll just make her SAD].  (=If you tell her 
the truth it’s not angry that you’ll make her but sad.) 
As is clear from the paraphrases, these examples too are ‘conditioned denials’, more specifically denials of a 
constituent of [+q] under condition P. However, a not in the Q-clause can have a third function, viz. that of 
effecting ‘metalinguistic’ or ‘external’ negation, i.e. of rejecting the truth or validity of the conditional as a 
whole. In that case the conditional is typically echoic, and the not in the Q-clause denies a statement or 
suggestion to the contrary: 
(101) 
 
a. 
[“Kate’ll be happy if you offer to help her.”] — “She’ll NOT be happy if I offer to help 
her. [She’ll know her boy-friend will be jealous.]”  (=It’s not true that she’ll be happy if I 
offer to help her) (=NOT ‘if [+p], then [+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
[“Tim will be delighted if you give him a bike for his birthday.”] — “Oh no, he WON’T be 
delighted if I do that. [He’s already got two bikes.”] 
In these examples, not has scope over the entire conditional and therefore over the relation between P and Q. 
Thus, (101a) expresses that my offering to help Kate will not entail her being happy. In this example, not 
negates the relation between P (the speaker’s offer of help) (=[+p]) and Q (Kate’s happiness) (=[+q]) rather 
than negating Q (or P) alone. Examples like (101a-b) are instances of ‘denied conditionals’, not ‘conditioned 
denials’. 
 
3.14. Specificational (focusing) conditional structures 
 
A sentence or clause is specificational if it focuses a constituent and in doing so represents it as the value 
satisfying a presupposed variable—see Declerck (1988b). For example: 
(102) 
 
a. 
The one who did it was JOHN. 
 
 
b. 
JOHN was the one who did it. 
 
 
c. 
It was JOHN who did it. 
 
 
d. 
JOHN did it. 
These sentences all presuppose the existence of a variable ‘the x who did it’ and specify the value ‘John’ for 
it. In doing so they focus John (intonationally and/or structurally), which is therefore interpreted 
contrastively: ‘John and no one else’. (Like other kinds of focusing, specificational focusing evokes a set of 
alternatives which are excluded from the predication.) Sentences (102a-d) can all be paraphrased: ‘The x 
who did it was the following: John’—see also Higgins (1976). 

In simplex (=one-clause) sentences, a specificational reading can only be triggered by a marked 
contrastive accent, as in (102d). In some cases where the sentence makes a gnomic or general statement, the 
specificational focusing engenders a conditional reading: 
(103) 
 
a. 
The RICH will get away with this, the POOR won’t.  (Compare: It is if you are rich, not if 
you are poor, that you’ll get away with this.) 
 
 
b. 
BLOND people often have a white, freckled skin.  (Compare: It is if people are blond that they 
often have a white, freckled skin.) 
As far as two-clause conditionals are concerned, there are five possibilities of a specificational interpretation: 
(a) only the P-clause is specificational, as in I’ll only do it if it’s John who asks me to; (b) only the Q-clause 
is specificational, as in If something goes wrong it’s you who will be blamed; (c) the conditional as a whole is 
a specificational sentence with P introducing the variable and Q specifying the value, as in If anyone can do 
that, it’s John; (d) the conditional is a specificational sentence in which the Q-clause defines the variable and 
the value specified for it is the condition P, which is expressed in a nonspecificational P-clause, as in Only if 
it does not RAIN do we have a walk after dinner (=‘The only case in which we have a walk after dinner is: if it 
does not rain’); (e) the conditional is a specificational sentence in which the variable is defined by the Q-
clause and the value specified for it is expressed by a P-clause which is specificational too, as in It is only if it 
wasn’t Oswald who did it that someone else must have killed Kennedy. 
Specificational conditional structures will be discussed in detail in section 11.14. 
 
3.15. The three canonical tense patterns of conditionals 
 
The treatment of conditionals in many pedagogic grammars and handbooks restricts itself to the following 
three patterns: 
 
Pattern 1: I will be happy if she comes. 
 
Pattern 2: I would be happy if she came. 
 
Pattern 3: I would have been happy if she had come. 
These three patterns are normally associated with three different meanings: the validity of P is represented as 
(respectively) possible, unlikely and contrary to fact, i.e. as what we call ‘open’, ‘tentative’ and 
‘counterfactual’. 
In chapters 4 and 9-11 it will be shown that there are many more types of conditional than these, and we 
will argue in chapter 7 that there are at least three dozen ways in which conditionals of these three tense 
patterns (taken together) can be interpreted. However, we will not discard the above typology because it is 
useful if the types are defined on a strictly formal basis (i.e. on the basis of the tense forms used). In this 
book, sentences having the outward form (especially the tenses) of one of the above three illustrations will be 
referred to as ‘(tense) pattern 1/2/3’ conditionals, irrespective of the interpretation they receive. 
 
3.16. Conclusion 
 
The purpose of this chapter has been to introduce some terminology which is essential to a good 
understanding of the next chapters. These terms are the following: 
Subordinate clause: a clause which cannot function as an independent sentence but which can form a 
sentence when combined with a main clause (e.g. if you leave in I’ll be glad if you leave). 
Fully integrated clause: a subclause that is syntactically fully integrated into the head clause, i.e. which is not 
separated from the head clause by a break in intonation (represented by a dash or comma in the written 
mode). 
Postscript-P conditional: a P-clause which follows the Q-clause and is separated from it by a slight break 
(representable by a comma or dash). Such a P-clause is, syntactically, not fully integrated into the Q-
clause but is offered as a ‘postscript’ or afterthought, as in I’ll come to you at five—if you will be alone 
or She must be mad, if she’s going round the world on that old bicycle. 
Restrictive postscript-P conditional: a postscript P-clause which has a restrictive meaning, i.e. which restricts 
the truth or applicability of the Q-clause a posteriori, as in the above example I’ll come to you at five—if 
you will be alone. 

Actualization conditional: a conditional expressing that the actualization of the P-situation is a condition for 
the actualization of the Q-situation. We distinguish between several types of actualization conditional, 
according to whether the P-clause is actualization-triggering (e.g. If it rains we’ll stay at home), 
actualization-licensing (e.g. I could open the door if I had the key), preclusive (e.g. If it rains, we won’t 
go to the seaside), nonpreclusive (e.g. If it rains, we’ll still go to the seaside) or an in case-clause. 
Assertoric clause: a clause which realizes the illocutionary act of making an assertion. An interrogative 
clause is not normally assertoric, except in the following cases: (a) if it is a rhetorical question, i.e. a 
sentence that has the form of a question but is interpreted as a forceful statement; (b) if it is a declarative 
question (i.e. an interrogative sentence that has the form of a declarative sentence, e.g. You’re his 
father?), and (c) if it is a ‘yes/no question’ (polar interrogative) which is interpreted as an assertion 
followed by a question tag asking for confirmation, e.g. Is he your leader, then? 
Assertive clause: a clause of which the message (but not necessarily the form) is that of an affirmative 
assertion. When the message is negative and/or interrogative, the clause is nonassertive. Only 
nonassertive clauses can contain nonassertive items (negative polarity items). Thus, a negative assertion 
like I haven’t any cakes left is assertoric but nonassertive—hence the use of the nonassertive item any. 
Inferential conditional: a conditional which expresses an inference from one proposition to another. (The 
latter proposition thus expresses an epistemically possible or necessary conclusion.) Unlike what we 
observe in actualization conditionals, the conditional link is not between the actualization of situations 
but between the validity of propositions. We can distinguish between direct inferentials and indirect 
inferentials. 
Direct inferential: an inferential conditional in which Q is inferred from P. 
Indirect inferential: an inferential conditional in which the inference goes from Q to P. The communicative 
purpose of an indirect inferential is to make the hearer draw an inference about the truth of P. This 
inference is indirect in that the conclusion is not explicitly asserted, but is to be inferred from Q and the 
conditional sentence as a whole. More specifically, the reasoning is that P must be false because it is 
incompatible with a Q-proposition which the speaker treats as true—see 3.6.2. Clear examples of such 
indirect inferentials are ad absurdum inferentials (e.g. If he is the general manager, I am Shakespeare!) 
or conditionals with an ostensibly closed P (e.g. If he’s so clever, why isn’t he rich?). 
Implicative conditional: a conditional in which there is a kind of causal, resultative, licensing, preclusive or 
nonpreclusive link between P and Q or Q and P. Under this heading we can bring together the 
inferential conditionals and the actualization conditionals. 
Case-specifying-P conditional: a conditional whose P-clause specifies a case or the case(s) in which the Q-
situation actualizes or in which the Q-proposition is asserted to be true. Within the class of case-
specifying-P conditionals we can distinguish the following subtypes: purely case-specifying-P 
conditionals (e.g. If I was thirsty I could buy myself a drink in the canteen), actualization conditionals 
(e.g. If he’s late, we’ll miss the show) and direct inferentials (e.g. If Bill has an alibi, he isn’t the 
culprit). 
Purely case-specifying-P conditional: a subtype of case-specifying-P conditional which is not implicative 
and in which the P-clause just specifies a case or the case(s) in which (or the circumstances under 
which) Q is true or the Q-situation actualizes (e.g. ‘Raphael Hotel Altona’ is ideal if you like to be in the 
heart of things). 
Set-identifying P-clause: a P-clause which specifies the cases in which Q is claimed to be true by restricting 
the scope of the Q-predication to a subset of a plural set referred to or implied in the Q-clause. For 
example, in Children are orphans if their parents are dead, the if-clause restricts the scope of the Q-
predication to a subset of the generic set of children. For this reason, the sentence is virtually 
synonymous with Children whose parents are dead are orphans. There are two kinds of set-identifying 
P-clauses, depending on whether the conjunction is if or unless. In the former case, the set is directly 
restricted by the if-clause, so that we speak of ‘set-restricting P-clauses’. When unless is used, the set is 
indirectly restricted by the exclusion of a subset (e.g. Lions are dangerous unless they aren’t hungry). In 
this case we speak of a ‘subset-excluding P-clause’. 
Possible-world classification: classification of conditionals on the basis of the possible world that is evoked 
by the P-clause and/or the Q-clause. The first distinction to be made is between ‘factual-P conditionals’ 
and ‘theoretical-P conditionals’. 
Factual-P conditional: a conditional whose P-clause refers to a situation that forms part of the actual world 
(i.e. its present state and history) (e.g. If I had a problem, I always went to my grandmother) 

Theoretical-P conditional: a conditional with a P-clause referring to a theoretical (=nonfactual) world. There 
are two subtypes: ‘neutral’ and ‘nonneutral’ theoretical-P conditionals. 
Neutral theoretical-P conditional: conditional with a theoretical P-clause which merely expresses a 
supposition, without presupposing anything about the relation of compatibility between the supposed 
world and the actual world. For example: If you need basics like saucepans, ironing boards and kettles, 
a department store may well be the place to start looking. (COB-W) This conditional presupposes 
neither ‘you need basics’ nor ‘you don’t need basics’, nor does its use suggest that the speaker has some 
assessment in mind of how likely it is that the proposition ‘you need basics’ is true. 
Nonneutral theoretical-P conditional: a conditional with a theoretical P-clause which expresses a supposition 
accompanied by an assumption (presupposition) about the relation of compatibility between the 
supposed world and the actual world. A nonneutral P-clause is either closed, open, tentative or 
counterfactual. 
Closed P-clause: an echoic P-clause expressing a condition which the speaker assumes to be fulfilled in the 
actual world (e.g. If, as you say, you can’t accompany me tonight, I’ll have to look for someone else). 
Open P-clause: a P-clause whose situation is assumed by the speaker to be one that may or may not actualize 
(or have actualized) in the real world. That is, the speaker treats fulfilment of the condition (supposition) 
as uncertain, but as a real possibility. For example: I will be happy if we find a solution; [I hope 
Liverpool won their home match yesterday.] If they did, they still have a chance of winning the 
championship. 
Tentative P-clause: a P-clause referring to a possible world which is assumed by the speaker to be unlikely to 
be (or become) the actual world. In other words, the speaker treats fulfilment of the supposition as rather 
unlikely or otherwise represents it as tentative (e.g. for reasons of politeness). For example: I would be 
happy if she came; I would appreciate it if you gave me a hand. 
Counterfactual P-clause: a P-clause referring to a possible world which is assumed by the speaker to be 
different from (incompatible with) the actual world. The speaker treats P (and, by implicature, Q) as 
false in the real world, i.e. as contrary to past, present or future fact. For example: My life would be 
easier if I had a car; If you had come tomorrow instead of today, you would not have found me at home. 
Irrealis conditional: a conditional referring to a world which is not conceived of as possibly matching the 
actual world. The possible world evoked by the P-clause may be either purely imaginary or 
counterfactual. 
Imaginary-P conditional: a conditional which refers to a world which is presented as existing in the 
imagination of the speaker only and which is not represented as being truth-conditionally related to the 
actual world. For example: In your place I would have been angry if she had done that. (This implies 
neither ‘she did not do it’ nor ‘she did it’.) 
Nonfactual-P conditional: synonym of ‘theoretical-P conditional’ 
Pseudo-Q conditional: a conditional in which the overt Q-clause is only ostensibly the Q-clause of the ‘if P, 
Q’ conditional. In fact, it is interpreted as a subclause of reason modifying a covert Q-clause. For 
example: If you are shot at, this bullet-proof jacket will protect you (=If you are shot at you won’t get 
hurt, because this bullet-proof jacket will protect you). 
Specificational sentence: a sentence which specifies a value for a presupposed variable and in doing so 
focuses the value. For example, each of the following sentences specifies ‘a book’ as the value that 
satisfies the variable ‘the x that I gave him’ and implies ‘nothing else’: It was a BOOK that I gave him, 
What I gave him was a BOOK, A BOOK was what I gave him, I gave him a BOOK. 
Denied conditional: a conditional with metalinguistic (external) negation in the Q-clause. Such a conditional 
is typically echoic, and the not in the Q-clause denies a statement or suggestion to the contrary. For 
example: [“Kate will be happy if you offer to help her.”] — “She will NOT be happy if I offer to help 
her. [She will know that her boy-friend will be jealous.”] This conditional is interpreted as ‘It is not true 
that she will be happy if I offer to help her’, i.e. as ‘NOT “if [+p], then [+q]”‘. That is, not has scope 
over the entire conditional and therefore over the relation between P and Q: the conditional expresses 
that my offering to help Kate will not entail her being happy. 
Conditioned denial: a conditional expressing a denial of [+q] under condition P. One subtype is when the 
negator in the Q-clause has wide scope over q. In that case not negates neither p nor the relation (e.g. 
inference) between p and q. Thus, both If she’s there, he {can’t be / isn’t} far away and He {can’t be / 
isn’t} far away if she’s there are interpreted as ‘[+p] leads us to infer [-q]’. In a second subtype, the 
negator in the Q-clause has narrow scope over a particular (accented) constituent of the Q-clause, which 

is therefore automatically interpreted ‘specificationally’, and hence contrastively. For example: BILL 
won’t help you if you need help [but JOHN will]. (This is interpreted as ‘If you need help, it’s not Bill 
who will help you [but John].’) 
Canonical (tense) patterns: On the basis of their form (especially the use of tenses), we can distinguish 
between three ‘canonical’ patterns of conditionals: 
 
 
Pattern 1: If she comes I will tell her everything. 
 
 
Pattern 2: If she came I would tell her everything. 
 
 
Pattern 3: If she had come I would have told her everything. 
 
We do not distinguish between the patterns on the basis of the meaning(s) which they can have. The 
only criterion is the form of the conditional. 

Chapter 4 
 
The possible-world typology of conditionals 
 
 
We have already briefly introduced this typology (in section 3.10). It can be summarized as follows: 
 
Table 1: the possible-world typology of conditionals 
 
possible P-world: 
 
 
- factual 
 
 
- theoretical (nonfactual) 
 
 
 
- neutral theoretical 
 
 
 
- nonneutral theoretical 
 
 
 
 
- closed 
 
 
 
 
- open 
 
 
 
 
- tentative 
 
 
 
 
- counterfactual 
 
In the present chapter we propose to examine this typology in more detail. However, before doing so, it is 
necessary to make some preliminary remarks. 
Although the possible-world typology is also relevant to some non-case-specifying-P conditionals, it is 
especially relevant to case-specifying-P ones. Any case-specifying-P conditional illustrates a particular 
possible-world type. For this reason we will mostly illustrate the various types with case-specifying-P 
examples.8 
In section 3.5, case-specifying-P conditionals were defined as conditionals in which the P-clause specifies 
a case or the case(s) in which the Q-situation actualizes or in which the P-clause restricts the scope of the Q-
predication by specifying a case or the case(s) in which the Q-predication is true. It has also been noted that, 
on the basis of the semantic contribution of the P-clause to the interpretation of the Q-clause and/or the 
conditional as a whole, case-specifying P-clauses may be classified as being either ‘actualization-
conditioning’, ‘premise-expressing’, or ‘purely case-specifying’—see chapter 9 for a more detailed 
discussion of these types, which are the P-clauses of actualization conditionals, inferential conditionals and 
purely case-specifying conditionals, respectively: 
(104) 
 
a. 
If I need him I will give him a call.  (actualization-conditioning-P: the actualization of 
the P-situation will trigger the actualization of the Q-situation) 
 
 
b. 
He won’t join the movement if his wife objects to it.  (actualization-conditioning-P: the 
actualization of the P-situation will preclude the actualization of the [+q]-situation, i.e. 
trigger the nonactualization of the [+q]-situation) 
 
 
c. 
If the key is not in the cupboard, it must be somewhere else.  (premise-expressing-P) 
 
 
d. 
If it rained, they won’t have left the house.  (premise-expressing-P) 
 
 
e. 
The basic research skills we teach them are useful if they go to university.  (purely case-
specifying-P) 
 
 
f. 
It makes an excellent family kitchen and the rounded edges are of course much kinder for 
children if a bump occurs.  (COB-W) (purely case-specifying-P) 
 
 
g. 
If I need a drink, I always have a Scotch.  (purely case-specifying-P) 
It should be noted that a premise-expressing P-clause usually precedes the Q-clause, although it can also 
follow the Q-clause if it is syntactically integrated into the latter (as in He {is / must be} up to something if he 
asks such questions). Examples with a premise-expressing P-clause in postscript position (=nonintegrated 
postposition, as in He must be up to something—if he asks such questions) are seldom found and should not 
be confused with ‘restrictive postscript P-clauses’ (e.g. He won’t be of much help—if he comes in the first 
                                              
8. 
However, there will be the occasional use of non-case-specifying P-examples. This will sometimes even be 
unavoidable, viz. when we refer to a subcategory (such as the class of ‘anchoring-P conditionals’ in section 
4.2.2.6) which consists of ‘rhetorical’ (=non-case-specifying-P) conditionals. 

place) because, unlike the latter, they do not restrict the scope of the Q-predication. (The meaning of a 
restrictive postscript-P conditional is ‘Q—[but] only if P’, while that of a postscript premise-expressing-P 
conditional is ‘Q—if [=on the basis of] P’). 
The typology of case-specifying-P conditionals which we want to examine in this chapter is based on the 
kind of possible world in which the Q-proposition is presented as true: that possible world may be the actual 
world or a theoretical (supposed) world created by the if-clause. We will speak of ‘factual-P’ and 
‘theoretical-P’ conditionals accordingly. In the latter, P expresses a supposition about a situation and in doing 
so creates a theoretical P-world. A theoretical-P conditional may or may not carry a presupposition about the 
truth, possible truth, unlikely truth or nontruth of the P-supposition, that is, about the degree of likelihood 
that the P-supposition is true. If it does not carry any such presupposition, it is a ‘neutral-P’ theoretical 
conditional; if a theoretical-P conditional does carry such a presupposition, then, depending on the 
presupposed degree of likelihood that P is true, the conditional can be subclassified as a ‘closed-P’, ‘open-P’, 
‘tentative-P’ or ‘counterfactual-P’ conditional. 
 
4.1. Factual-P conditionals 
 
In this type, the P-situation is represented and interpreted as factual, i.e. as forming part of the actual world. 
The speaker commits herself to the truth of P in the real world. Examples of this are not very common, 
because if inherently creates a suppositional world, and it is only exceptionally that a situation which is to be 
interpreted as a fact is represented as a supposition in a case-specifying-P conditional. Still, we can 
distinguish the following possibilities (which disprove Dancygier & Sweetser [1997: 114] generalization that 
if marks “nonassertion of the if-clause”). 
 
4.1.1. Past repetitive habits 
 
P is interpreted as factual when the Q-clause of an actualization conditional refers to a repetitive-habitual 
situation which is located in the past or pre-present: 
(105) 
 
a. 
[“Wasn’t it dangerous for the President to enter the stadium?”] — “No, he only ever 
entered it if it had been thoroughly inspected by the police.” 
 
 
b. 
[During the three years it took her to win her case, Rafiq became the pariah of Glasgow’s 
Pakistani community: “Some people spat on me,] others would cross the street if they saw me, 
[and some put an envelope filled with excrement in the letter slot of the door.]”  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[Since I’ve known her] I’ve always gone to her if I’ve had a problem. 
 
 
d. 
If I had a problem, I always went to my grandmother. 
 
 
e. 
I didn’t go in with her, not unless she wanted me to. 
 
 
f. 
I (always) avoided her if I could. 
 
 
g. 
[Once she’d had the plaster put on, Isabelle was so heavy to carry around I just couldn’t do it, 
and nappies were a major problem because she had to wear them over the plaster.] If the 
plaster got wet it became smelly and disintegrated, [so we had to seal it with Sleek and treat it 
with Nilodor].  (COB-W) 
In such examples the idea of past habit is based on a number of past instances (actualizations): we are 
referring to a repetitive habit. Even though these past instances are not directly referred to, they are taken for 
granted in interpretation. 
In this type of conditional it seems that just before each actualization of Q, there has been an affirmative 
answer to a question version of P: “Has the stadium been inspected?” — “Yes.” — “Then the president will 
enter it.” Similarly: “Do I see her?” — “Yes. Then I’ll cross the road.” (This means that in example [107b] 
the speaker must be taking the ‘camera-angle’ of the people doing the spitting, crossing the road, etc.) 
Examples of this category of factual-P conditionals are typically actualization conditionals or purely case-
specifying-P conditionals. They are never inferentials. (In fact, we will see below that direct inferentials in 
general can never have a factual P-clause.) 
 
4.1.2. Performative P-clauses 
 

P is also interpreted as factual when the P-clause of an actualization conditional is used in a performative 
way, i.e. if it is the very action of uttering the P-clause that makes the P-situation actualize: 
(106) 
 
a. 
[“May I invite you for a drink?”] — “Excuse me, please, if I decline. [I have some urgent 
business to attend to.]” 
 
 
b. 
[Yet according to the government the number of homeless people in the UK has now reached 
300,000, over 50% of these are under 25 and this figure is continuing to grow at an alarming 
rate.] If you add to these those who are at risk or who have been considered as ‘no hopers’, the 
number of people who need our help is truly of crisis proportions.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[And thirty-four witnesses could testify to that.] Thirty-five, if you included the driver.  (DOC) 
 
 
d. 
[The corporate culture of a large multinational organization includes: achievement motivation, 
interpersonal skills, cognitive skills, flexibility. These can be expressed as a pawnbroker 
model (see Figure 8.1).] If I relate this model to the organizational changes at BP, the 
following key requirements emerge for managers of the future.  [adapted from COB-W] 
Because the actualization of the P-situation is brought about by the illocutionary speech act of uttering the P-
clause, it follows that the speaker, who deliberately uses the P-clause in this performative way, treats P as 
factual, and that the hearer interprets it as such. As in the previous class of factual-P conditionals, the P-
clause is actualization-conditioning or purely case-specifying rather than premise-expressing. 
 
4.1.3. Factuality indirectly following from counterfactuality 
 
In a counterfactual-P conditional where P is [+p], the evoked ‘#[+p]’ (where # represents the negation 
effected by counterfactuality) is normally interpreted as closed, but not as factual: 
(107) 
 
If she had been honest, she would have told us about it. 
The P-clause here implies the #P-clause ‘She was not honest’, i.e. implies that the speaker believes in the 
nontruth (in the actual world) of the proposition ‘She is/was honest.’ However, this does not mean that the 
latter proposition (#[+p]) is presented as factual. It just means that ‘#[+p]’ is presented as being assumed to 
be a fact, i.e. as a closed proposition. Similarly: 
(108) 
 
If she hadn’t been honest, she would have told us some lie. 
Here too, #P (which is now ‘#[-p]’: ‘she is/was honest’) is believed by the speaker to be true (=closed) but is 
not presented as a factual proposition. 
However, there are a number of cases in which #P is presented as factual rather than just closed: 
 
4.1.3.1. Counterfactual unless and if...not 
 
As will be noted in section 13.3.2, the unless-clause of a counterfactual-P unless-conditional is interpreted as 
‘if it were not for the fact that’ or ‘if it had not been the case that’. The equivalent if...not-clause is interpreted 
similarly. This reading is a factual interpretation. Thus, when interpreted as (6b), (6a) implies that it is a fact 
that the hearer helped the speaker: 
(109) 
 
a. 
{Unless you’d helped me / If you hadn’t helped me}, I wouldn’t have finished the job in 
time. 
 
 
b. 
If it weren’t for the fact that you helped me, I wouldn’t have finished the job in time. 
Similarly: 
(110) 
 
a. 
If you hadn’t been my father, I would’ve hit you in the face. 
 
 
b. 
If it hadn’t been for the fact that you are my father, I would’ve hit you in the face. 
(111) 
 
a. 
Unless you had told me, I would never have found the solution. 
 
 
b. 
If it hadn’t been the case that you told me, I would never have found the solution. 
 
4.1.3.2. Counterfactual ‘ad absurdum’ conditionals 
 
In counterfactual ‘ad absurdum’ conditionals, the negative proposition #P evoked by the counterfactual 
reading is ultimately interpreted as factual. This follows from the fact that the conditional is an inferential 

and Q is interpreted as absurd: if Q is false, then P (which entails Q) must also be false. Thus, if P is [-p], #P 
is ‘not [-p]’, which is equivalent to [+p]. This means that the speaker of If Oswald didn’t kill Kennedy, I’m 
Shakespeare presents the conclusion that Oswald killed Kennedy as being a fact in the actual world. This is 
again an indirect kind of factual-P interpretation in that what is interpreted as factual (=true in the actual 
world), is not P (=[-p]) but rather the deduced #P-proposition, which is ‘not [-p]’. Similarly, if P is [+p], #P is 
interpreted as ‘not [+p]’, which is equivalent to [-p].9 (For a further discussion of such sentences, see section 
9.2.7.1.) 
 
4.1.3.3. Other kinds of counterfactual ‘indirect inferentials’ 
 
#P is similarly interpreted as factual (=true in the actual world) in other counterfactual indirect inferentials: 
(112) 
 
a. 
But Superman wouldn’t be Superman if he let this kind of injustice happen.  [So up he 
rises in the air and lands right between the little child and the villain.] (Because Q is 
contradictory, i.e. semantically anomalous, the only possible conclusion from Q is that the P-
situation does not actualize. This means that #P (=‘not [+p]’) is true in the actual world: 
Superman did not let this kind of injustice happen.) 
 
 
b. 
If John is such a good player (as you claim), how come he has not even been selected to be a 
substitute?  (The Q-proposition ‘He has not even been selected to be a substitute’ is treated as 
incompatible with P: in the speaker’s opinion, P cannot be true [factual] if Q is. It is therefore 
implied that the factuality of Q leads to the conclusion that P must be false, hence that #P 
(=‘not [+p]’) is true, i.e. that John is not such a good player as is claimed.) 
 
4.1.4. Non-case-specifying-P conditionals with factual P-clause 
 
At the beginning of this chapter it was said that we were mostly going to use case-specifying-P conditionals 
as illustrations (because these necessarily belong to one of the possible-world types), but that the various 
possible-world types of conditionals were also realized by some non-case-specifying-P (=rhetorical) 
conditionals. Illustrating these for each type of rhetorical conditional would obviously take us too far (and 
would be difficult at this point because the types of rhetorical conditional are only introduced in chapter 10). 
However, we can illustrate the point by drawing attention to factual-P conditionals like the following: 
(113) 
 
I enjoyed the party, even if I did get red wine all over my new sweater. 
In this example the if-clause is of the concessive type, which is non-case-specifying. 
 
4.1.5. Seemingly factual P-clauses 
 
For the sake of clarity, we wish to repeat that factual P-clauses (which represent P as known to be true in the 
actual world) should be carefully distinguished from closed P-clauses (which express P as assumed to be true 
for the sake of the argument). Thus, in noncounterfactual direct inferentials like (114a-d), the premise-
expressing P-clauses are not factual-P, although they are sometimes called so—see e.g. Dik (1990: 246); 
Taylor (1997: 301-304)—but closed-P: for the sake of the argument, the speaker treats P as true. Whether or 
not P is really true in the actual world is irrelevant to this. In the following examples, the proposition 
following if is true (factual) in isolation, but is only ‘treated as true’ (=closed) as the P-proposition of a

Akatsuka (1991: 26) claims that ad absurdum conditionals are not used to “indirectly communicate” ‘not-P’ but 
rather to reject the previous speakers’s claim / belief P. This may well be true, but it does not alter the fact that the 
P-clause is ultimately interpreted as meaning that ‘not-P’ is a fact.

4.2. Theoretical-world conditionals 
 
4.2.1. Definition 
 
When the P-proposition (i.e. [+p] or [-p]) is not represented as true in the actual world (i.e. if the speaker 
does not commit herself to the truth of P), it creates a ‘theoretical world’, i.e. a possible world which is, or 
may be, different from the actual world. As was said in the introduction to this chapter, a conditional whose 
P-clause refers to a theoretical P-world—a theoretical-P conditional—may refer to that theoretical world 
without relating it in any way to the real world. In this case we speak of a ‘neutral-P’ conditional (or to be 
precise, a neutral-P theoretical-P conditional). A speaker who uses a neutral-P conditional does not convey 
any assumption (presupposition) about the likelihood that the theoretical-P world resembles the real world. 
Alternatively, a speaker may use a ‘nonneutral-P conditional’. In such a theoretical-P conditional, the P-
clause carries a presupposition about the extent to which the theoretical world is likely to resemble the real 
world, that is, how likely P is to be (or become) true in the actual world. We find four different types of 
nonneutral-P conditionals, according to whether the P-clause presupposition is that P is being treated as true, 
possibly true, unlikely to be true, or false. We speak of closed-P, open-P, tentative-P and counterfactual-P 
conditionals, respectively. Note that the presupposition of a closed P-clause differs from the presupposition 
of a factual P-clause. The presupposition of a factual P-clause is that P is true, not that P is treated as 
(=assumed to be) true. That is, the speaker who uses a factual-P conditional intends to convey that P is true in 
the actual world, whilst the speaker who uses a closed-P conditional intends only to convey that she is 
willing to entertain the idea that P is true, and she conveys at the same time that she does not commit herself 
to the truth of P in the actual world. This is why a speaker can ask (115a) but not (115b): 
(115) 
 
a. 
If John’s in Ibiza, how is it that I’ve just seen him in the pub? 
 
 
b. 
*Since John’s in Ibiza, how is it that I’ve just seen him in the pub? 
In (115a), the speaker conveys the message that entertaining the idea that P is true leads her to feel puzzled as 
to how P’s apparent truth can be reconciled with the certain truth of Q. In (115b), the speaker conveys the 
contradictory message that John is in Ibiza, and that he is not (because he is in the pub). The P-situation 
referred to by a factual-P conditional has the same factual status as the situation referred to in the since-
clause above. The P-clause of (115a) is therefore not factual but closed. 
 
4.2.2. Neutral-P conditionals 
 
It is typical of neutral-P conditionals that the speaker uses the P-clause to express no more than a pure 
supposition about theoretical cases. That is, she assumes (presupposes) nothing as to the (in)compatibility of 
the theoretical P-world with the actual world: there is no assumption that the case(s) referred to are true, 
false, possibly true, or unlikely to be (or become) true in the real world. The moment there is such an 
assumption, the theoretical-P conditional is of a nonneutral type. 
We can distinguish the following types of neutral-P conditional: 
 
4.2.2.1. Conditionals with nonspecific reference in the P-clause 
 
One subtype of this type of neutral-P conditional contains explicit or implicit reference in the P-clause to a group 
which may or may not include the hearer / reader. In such conditionals, the P-clause refers to a set of people 
in general. (In most examples the speaker uses you or your to address a nonspecific addressee, i.e. an 
arbitrary member of a set.) Though the speaker naturally assumes that there are people belonging to this set, 
she does not assume (nor denies, for that matter) that the hearer (or any other specific person) forms part of 
the set. There is simply no presupposition that the application of P to a specific person is true, false, unlikely 
to be true, or a real possibility. For example: 
(116) 
 
a. 
If you have enjoyed shopping from the Friends of the Earth catalogue, you may like us to 
send a copy to some of your friends and relatives.  (COB-W) 

 
 
b. 
If a woman has a history of cancer in her family, she should have herself checked at least once 
a year. 
 
 
c. 
[It is important to make early arrangements for the date and time of your marriage.] If you are 
having a religious ceremony go and see the minister or clergyman who is to take the service, 
before completing the notice of marriage.  (COB-W)

e. 
[The boys swimming on the two nights are listed overleaf.] If your son will be nine years old 
on Sunday 25th March he will swim on Wednesday 8th February. If he is eight or ten on 25th

f.

g. 
If the slugs eat more of your lettuces than you do, here’s the solution. 
 
 
h. 
Most parents wish the baby to sleep in a separate room if their house or flat is big enough. 
In another subtype the neutral P-clause does not contain a noun phrase or determiner with nonspecific 
reference, but the Q-clause or the context implies a nonspecific referent: 
(117) 
 
a. 
[Please send the donation form to Christopher Brown, Director, NSPCC, in the Freepost 
envelope provided. ... ] If the name and address shown are incorrect please amend them and 
return the form to us.  (COB-W) (The Q-clause implies a nonspecific addressee because it is 
in the imperative.) 
 
 
b. 
[This is a soil-borne fungus which attacks the roots ... Grow your own plants from seeds, 
raising them in sterilized compost so there is no risk of bringing the disease in on soil from 
other gardens ... ] If it’s already there, dip the roots in a thick solution of a systemic fungicide 
before planting.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[It makes an excellent family kitchen and] the rounded edges are of course much kinder for 
children if a bump occurs.  (COB-W) (The nonspecific addressee is anyone possibly showing 
interest in this kind of kitchen.) 
 
 
d. 
Emergency lighting should be fitted ... in the hall, if there is no glass in the front door to let in 
light.  (COB-W) 
 
4.2.2.2. Gnomic (universal, omnitemporal) Q-clauses 
 
A P-clause also expresses a neutral condition if the Q-clause receives a gnomic (universal, omnitemporal) 
interpretation. Such conditionals imply the existence of past, present and future instances of actualization. 
The former two are factual, whereas the future instantiations are theoretical. Although the gnomic 
conditional as a whole has a factual present meaning (in the sense that it expresses an eternal truth), its P-
clause has a neutral present meaning: the speaker does not presuppose actualization of a P-instance at the 
time of speech: 
(118) 
 
a. 
If water boils, it changes into steam. 
 
 
b. 
If a shop’s good enough, it’s worth making a little effort to get to.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
If you throw a piece of foam rubber into water, it does not sink. 
 
 
d. 
Carrots grow particularly well if they are sown at this time of year, [as they miss the attentions 
of the dreaded carrot fly].  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
Accidents can often be avoided if you take some basic precautions.  (COB-W) 
This kind of conditional sentence (which typically expresses cause and effect) makes a statement of 
omnitemporal or at least temporally unrestricted validity. The gnomic sentence as a whole is interpreted as 
factual (true at the time of speech), but the P-clause itself does not imply present actualization. The P-clause 
must therefore be considered as expressing a neutral rather than a factual condition for Q-actualization. 
 
4.2.2.3. Conditionals whose Q-clause expresses a present habit 
 
Similar remarks can be made in connection with conditionals whose Q-clause expresses a present habit (i.e. a 
characteristic of the referent of the subject noun phrase over an extended period of time including the time of 

speech—see Comrie [1976: 27-28]). If a present habit involves repetition, it implies the existence of 
instances. (This is why when[ever] can substitute for if in the examples below.) Because none of these 
instances need actualize at the time of speech, P is neutral. However, the habit expressed by the Q-clause is 
itself factual, in that it is a characteristic holding at the time of speech. 
(119) 
a. 
If I go into town, I take the bus. 
 
 
b. 
If I want to talk to someone in New York, I just simply pick up the phone and dial.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
If she has a problem, she goes to her grandmother. 
 
 
d. 
If I haven’t caught in four hours, I pack up. If I am getting fish, then the maximum session 
would be six hours.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
If I want to go on a drunken rampage and throw up in dustbins I will [without it even crossing 
my mind that this is unacceptable female behaviour].  (COB-W) 
In such examples, the repetitive habit expressed by the Q-clause is factual, because it exists at the time of 
speech. For this reason, the Q-clause uses the present tense (or modal will / would expressing characteristic 
behaviour). (Note, however, that the Q-clause refers to the habit as a whole, not to a present instance of the 
habit. Whilst the habit exists at the time of speech, there is no reference to an instance of the habit actualizing 
at the time of speech. In fact, there may or may not be such a present instance.) The instances that make up 
the present repetitive habit are partly factual (viz. those belonging to the past or present), and partly 
theoretical (viz. those lying in the future). Since it is the function of the P-clause to indicate (pick out) all the 
instances (both factual and theoretical) of the Q-habit, the P-clause has a neutral case-specifying meaning. 
(An exception to this is when the P-clause uses an accented modal auxiliary implying a present habit, as in If 
you {WILL / MUST} smoke one cigarette after another, of course you’re always coughing. Here the P-clause 
does not pick out instances of a habit expressed in the Q-clause but expresses a present habit itself, i.e. a P-
habit. It therefore has a factual rather than neutral meaning.) 
 
4.2.2.4. Set-identifying-P conditionals 
 
The same remarks are also true of ‘set-identifying-P conditionals’ (see section 3.9.2 above): 
(120) 
 
a. 
Children are orphans if their parents are dead. 
 
 
b. 
Children cannot read or write unless they go to school. 
As will be noted in section 9.3.2.4, it is typical of set-identifying-P conditionals that they must have a 
gnomic, or at least general, meaning. This means that the set that is restricted must not be well-defined: it is 
always referred to by a noun phrase with ‘unbounded’ reference, i.e. a noun phrase referring to a set or mass 
without specifying the boundaries of the set or mass (Declerck 1988a: 153). Because of this gnomic 
meaning, set-identifying-P conditionals have a P-clause that expresses a neutral condition: the conditional 
reveals no presupposition as to whether, at the time indicated by the tense, the condition is actually fulfilled, 
not fulfilled, etc. in the real world. (Theoretically speaking, it is possible that there are no children that are 
orphans in the actual world. This possibility may run counter to our pragmatic knowledge, but this is 
irrelevant to the question under discussion.) 
At first sight, the claim that set-identifying P-clauses are always neutral would seem to be falsified by 
examples like the following: 
(121) 
 
Whales would not be mammals if they laid eggs. 
However, the P-clause is not set-restricting in this example: it does not restrict the Q-predication to a subset 
of whales. The conditional is an inferential and makes a counterfactual statement about whales in general. A 
true set-restricting-P conditional can never be counterfactual. Compare: 
(122) 
 
a. 
Children are orphans if their parents are dead. 
 
 
b. 
??Children would be orphans if their parents were dead. 
Whereas the former sentence is more or less equivalent to Children whose parents are dead are orphans, the 
latter sentence (if at all acceptable) would make a statement about all children, not about a subset of them. 
The P-clause would therefore be case-specifying but not set-restricting. 
This conclusion is in keeping with the fact that set-restricting P-clauses cannot express a closed, open or 
tentative condition either. Compare: 

(123) 
 
a. 
*Children will be orphans if, as you say, their parents will be killed.  (closed set-
restricting P-clause) 
 
 
b. 
These children will be orphans if, as you say, their parents will be killed.  (closed condition; 
the P-clause is not set-restricting because its subject is a definite NP—see section 9.3.2.4) 
(124) 
 
a. 
*Children will be orphans if their parents are killed.  (open set-restricting P-clause) 
 
 
b. 
These children will be orphans if their parents are killed.  (open condition; P-clause not set-
restricting) 
(125) 
 
a. 
*Children would be orphans if their parents were killed.  (tentative set-restricting P-
clause) 
 
 
b. 
These children would be orphans if their parents were killed.  (tentative condition; P-clause 
not set-restricting) 
Incidentally, the acceptability of the (b) examples accords with the fact that case-specifying-P conditionals 
that do not have a set-restricting P-clause allow reference to any nonneutral theoretical P-world: 
(126) 
 
a. 
We can’t interrupt our journey if we’re to be on time.  (closed condition) 
 
 
b. 
You can leave the country if you have a passport.  (closed or open condition) 
 
 
c. 
He wouldn’t find us at home if he came tomorrow.  (tentative condition) 
 
 
d. 
She wouldn’t still be here if she didn’t enjoy our company.  (counterfactual condition) 
 
4.2.2.5. If you say so 
 
A fifth type of neutral-P conditional is illustrated by the following: 
(127) 
 
a. 
[“Well, if she did have a car, she couldn’t park it in the Banbury Road, that’s for certain.” 
— “So she hasn’t got a car?” — “Well, if she has, she doesn’t use it.” — “She probably came 
by bus then.”] — “If you say so, sir.”  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
[“He wrote something like: ‘I’ve got a truly marvellous demonstration of this proposition 
which this margin is too narrow to contain.’ Isn’t that a wonderful sentence?”] — “If you say 
so, sir.”  (DOC) 
Here the speaker is not saying that he does not know whether the addressee says something or not. The 
neutrality of the P-clause concerns the contents of what the addressee has said. The reply If you say so, sir 
makes clear that this speaker does not necessarily share the first speaker’s opinion, but that she does not 
challenge it either. That is, saying If you say so enables the speaker to reveal nothing about the assumption 
she makes about whether the preceding remark is true, false, or possibly or probably true or false. This 
follows from the fact that the Q-clause is not expressed. If there is an overt Q-clause, as in If you say so, it 
will (not) be true, the P-clause expresses a condition which could be analysed as either factual or closed, but 
not as neutral. 
It should be noted, however, that not all examples of If you say so sentences are that neutral. While all of 
them ostensibly signal acquiescence as to the content of the addressee’s utterance, there is often an 
understanding that the speaker has tacit reservations or is suppressing outright disagreement. If uttered in a 
suitable context and pronounced with a suitable intonation pattern, if you say so can be interpreted this way: 
(128) 
 
a. 
[“He’s charming when you get to know him.”] — “If you say so.” 
 
 
b. 
[“You’re wrong, his eyes aren’t blue, they’re green.”] — “If you say so.” 
 
 
c. 
[“What’s she like?” — “Any bloody idiot can tell you what she’s like!”] — “If you say so, 
sir.” 
 
4.2.2.6. Anchoring-P conditionals 
 
A sixth type of neutral-P conditional consists of what we call ‘anchoring-P conditionals’, i.e. conditionals in 
which the main, and sometimes only, function of the P-clause is to anchor the Q-clause into the ongoing 
discourse. (This kind of P-clause is not case-specifying—see section 10.1.2.) It is typical of anchoring-P 
conditionals that the speaker has, or purports to have, no knowledge in connection with the (past, present or 
future) actualization of the P-situation and does not make (or purport to make) any assumption in connection 
with this: 

(129) 
 
a. 
[“You another dur’y ol’ man or somethin’?”] — “If I am, I’m a dirty old police 
inspector,” [replied Morse, in what he trusted was a cultured, authoritative tone].  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
[Lewis is not known to have a girlfriend, and] if he does he’s not telling.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
If he noticed Brand, he didn’t comment.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
If Paul had returned, he did not come to relieve Alistair. [But probably, Alistair thought, he 
had not come back at all.]  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
If Mrs Rodway was ... impressed by this amalgam of metaphors, she gave no indication of it.  
(DOC) 
 
 
f. 
[“Has Stella Grey’s daughter ever got married?” — “I don’t know.] If she has, I’ve never been 
informed.”  (DOC) 
In (129a), P is a neutral supposition, because there is no assumption (presupposition) on Morse’s part that he 
treats the supposition as true, untrue, unlikely to be true, or as a real possibility. As regards this, the 
conditional shows no commitment whatever on the part of Morse. More specifically, Morse does not admit 
that he is, or may be, a dirty old man. Similarly, in (129b)-(129f) the P-clauses are totally noncommittal.10 
Sentences (129a)-(129f) are thus all neutral-P conditionals, which differ clearly from examples of open-P 
conditionals about the present or past (e.g. [I don’t know if Liverpool won their game yesterday, but] if they 
did they must be top of the League now). The latter are inferential conditionals with a case-specifying P-
clause expressing an open condition. By contrast, in (129a)-(129f) there is no inferential link between P and 
Q, and the condition is a neutral one. 
Another characteristic of anchoring-P conditionals is that the conditional format enables the speaker to 
deal with (i.e. anticipate and rule out) pragmatic presuppositions or implicatures that might arise from a more 
straightforward response. Thus, in (129a), if Morse just answered (No,) I’m a policeman—which would be a 
normal response—it would be implicated (and, if no is used, implied) that being a policeman rules out being 
a dirty old man. The if-clause acknowledges the falsity of this implicature. In (129b), the choice of an 
anchoring-P conditional seems to be a way of packaging information, in order to avoid saying something 
like: He’s not telling about a girlfriend, which he may or may not have, or worse: He’s not telling about his 
girlfriend, but / and he quite possibly doesn’t have a girlfriend. Similarly, (129c) and (129d) enable the 
speaker to escape having to say something awkward like He didn’t comment on his noticing Brand, which he 
may or may not have done or The goal of Paul’s coming back, which he may or may not have done, was not 
to relieve Alistair. In (129e), to say no more than that Mrs Rodway gave no indication of being impressed 
would implicate that she was not impressed; again, the P-clause is indispensable if the speaker is to suggest 
that this implicature might be false. In (129f), the P-clause blocks the pragmatic presupposition ‘Stella 
Grey’s daughter got married’ which would be conveyed if the speaker said I’ve never been informed that 
Stella Grey’s daughter got married. 
 
4.2.2.7. Imaginary-P conditionals 
 
‘Imaginary’ P-clauses form a seventh (and very clear) type of neutral P-clauses: as explained in section 
3.10.2, they presuppose or implicate nothing in connection with the (in)compatibility of the suppositional P-
world with the real world. For example: 
(130) 
 
a. 
In your place I wouldn’t react if he wrote me a threatening letter.  (This sentence neither 
affirms nor denies the speaker’s not reacting to a threatening letter. In other words, the Q-
situation is presented neither as factual nor as counterfactual. The utterance is a pure 
supposition, i.e. a mere thought experiment.)11 
                                              
10. Note that in (129d), despite the added but-clause, it is not possible to detect from the P-clause of the conditional 
any evaluation of the likelihood of the P-situation’s actualization. This may be because the conditional is presented 
from the narrator’s point of view whilst the added but-clause is presented from Alistair’s point of view, or it could 
be simply that the two sentences represent two different ways in which Alistair represents to himself the situation 
of Paul’s return. 
11. Unlike Harder (1996: 456), who applies the term “thought experiment” to tentative-P and counterfactual-P 
conditionals, we speak of ‘thought experiment’ in connection with imaginary-P conditionals only. 

 
 
b. 
[I didn’t go to the party, so I don’t know if I would’ve become as drunk as you all appear to 
have been. In fact, I’m afraid] I would’ve been drunk too, unless I’d had my wife with me. 
 
 
c. 
[It seemed unlikely that such a frail woman would have been capable of strangling her healthy 
husband. However] if it had been her, the clues that would have been left would have been 
exactly the same as those we did find. [So we could not cancel her from our list of suspects.] 
 
 
d. 
[Suppose the door was actually locked.] If the door had been locked, the burglar would first 
have tried to open a window, [and that would explain why we found those footprints in the 
flower-beds.] 
As is clear from these examples (and as was noted in section 3.11), imaginary P-conditionals are not formally 
distinguishable from counterfactual conditionals: they also show tense pattern 2 or 3. This explains why 
imaginary P-conditionals have often been mistaken for counterfactuals. (For example, Han [1996: 125-126] 
subscribes to Karttunen and Peters’ [1979] argument that the counterfactuality of a P-clause is a 
conversational implicature because it can be cancelled. However, this argument is void because all the 
examples on which it is based are actually imaginary-P conditionals.) 
 
4.2.3. Nonneutral theoretical-P conditionals 
 
In our possible-world classification of conditionals we have so far dealt with factual-P conditional and one 
sort of theoretical-P conditionals, namely neutral theoretical-P conditionals. What remains to be discussed 
are the nonneutral theoretical-P conditionals. As noted in section 3.10.3, these can be further subclassified on 
the basis of the kind of presupposition (assumption) that is added to the theoretical P-proposition (P-
supposition). This leads to a distinction between closed-P, open-P, tentative-P and counterfactual-P 
conditionals. In these four types, different truth relations are assumed to hold between the theoretical P-world 
and the actual world. 
 
4.2.4. Closed-P conditionals 
 
4.2.4.1. Definition 
 
A closed P is a proposition that is true in a closed P-world. A closed world is a theoretical world described by 
propositions that are assumed to be true in the actual world. That is, in closed-P conditionals, P is not known 
to be a fact but is accepted (or ostensibly accepted—see section 4.2.4.6 below) as being true in the actual 
world. (This definition differs from Bailey’s [1989: 277], who uses “acquiescing” in the sense of our 
‘closed’, and applies “closed” to counterfactual P-clauses and tentative P-clauses referring to the future.) In 
most cases a closed-P conditional is an inferential conditional (see section 4.2.4.4 below) and the assumption 
that P is true happens for the sake of the argument or reasoning process. A closed P-clause may be 
introduced by if or (sometimes) given that, but not by any of the other conditional conjunctions (not even 
assuming that or supposing that). The latter conjunctions refer to a condition which is open rather than 
closed, and are not suitable to introduce an ‘echoic’ P-clause. (As we will see in section 4.2.4.3, a closed P-
clause is typically echoic.) The following examples of closed-P conditionals also illustrate that a closed P-
clause may refer to any time. 
(131) 
 
a. 
[“I didn’t do it.” — “I believe you.] But if you didn’t do it, it must have been Fred.” 
 
 
b. 
[“The picture you are now looking at is a Van Gogh.”] — “Well, if this is a Van Gogh, I’m 
rather disappointed by it.” 
 
 
c. 
[“There’s nothing more to say.”] — “But if you felt—feel—so strongly, why didn’t you agree 
to give evidence at the Inquest?”  (DOC) 
 
 
d. 
If, as they say, they were late yesterday, it cannot have been because of the weather. 
 
 
e. 
If I’m going to catch the 5.12 train, I’d better be on my way now.  (presupposes that I want to 
catch that train) 
 
 
f. 
If (as I am told now) he will come here himself tomorrow, I no longer need to try and get into 
contact with him today. 
 
 
g. 
If Sylvia had played around with this guy, she’d had a dangerous taste for the strange and the 
ugly.  (COB-W) (This conditional is ambiguous between a closed-P interpretation [for which 
some context is needed], an open-P reading and a [habitual] neutral-P reading.) 

 
 
h. 
If the work will be done anyhow, I might as well have a lie down. 
The P-clause and the Q-clause may refer to different times: 
(132) 
 
a. 
If, as I believe, she knows where the money is, she probably told her friend, Mrs 
Hawkins. 
 
 
b. 
If, as I believe, she had already left when the murder was committed, she won’t be able to tell 
us much. 
 
4.2.4.2. Closed-P conditionals with P relating to another nonfactual world 
 
An if-clause may sometimes function simultaneously as the P-clause of one conditional and as the Q-clause 
of another: 
(133) 
 
I won’t go to the meeting if there will be trouble if I go. 
In such conditionals, the P-clause (if I go) accompanying the if-clause functioning as Q-clause (there will be 
trouble) is often replaced by a pro-form or deleted. In chapter 11, where we will discuss these possibilities in 
detail, we will speak of (a) ‘implicit-P conditionals’ (section 11.9), where P is implicit in a nominal, e.g. I 
will give you £10 if that will help (which is interpreted as ‘I will give you £10 if it will help if I give you 
£10’), and (b) ‘covert-P conditionals’ (section 11.7), where P is neither overtly expressed nor implicit in one 
of the constituents of the conditional, e.g. I COULD answer that question (=‘I could answer that question {if I 
wanted to / if it was put to me / etc.}.’) In both cases the (implicit or covert) P-clause is actually the Q-clause 
of another conditional whose P-clause remains implicit or covert. Returning to our main point, we can point 
out that closed-P conditionals may easily be of one of these types: 
(134) 
a. 
If (as I believe) there will be trouble <if we go to the pub>, then we’d better not go to the pub.  
(covert-P conditional: the closed-P overt ‘if’-clause expresses the Q of an open-P conditional; 
the implied P of this open-P conditional is added within angle brackets.) 
 
 
b. 
If (as you say) it will help you <if I lend you ten pounds>, I am willing to lend you £10.  
(implicit-P conditional: the P-clause within angle brackets is replaced by the pro-form ‘it’; 
the overt ‘if’-clause is closed-P and actually functions as the Q-clause of an open-P 
conditional. [This explains the use of the future tense form ‘will help’ in it.]) 
 
 
c. 
If (as I believe) you would be able to open my safe <if you wanted to>, it is time I bought a 
more sophisticated one.  (covert-P conditional; the overt closed-P ‘if’-clause functions as the 
Q-clause of a tentative-P conditional.) 
 
 
d. 
If (as you say) you would have been able to open my safe <if you had wanted to>, it is time I 
bought a more sophisticated one.  (similar) 
In all these examples, if can be paraphrased as ‘if (as I assume) it is the case that’. The head clause each time 
expresses an inferred Q-proposition. The closedness of the overtly expressed condition is illustrated by the 
fact that the following kind of paraphrase (in this case, of [134b]) is perfectly suitable: 
(135) 
 
“Will it help you if I lend you £10?” — “Yes.” — “In that case I will lend you £10.” 
In sum, the P-proposition that is assumed to be true may be either a proposition about the actual world or the 
Q-proposition of an open-P, closed-P, tentative-P or counterfactual-P conditional. Since any proposition of 
the latter kind is clearly nonfactual, this double possibility necessitates distinguishing between the actual 
world and closed P-worlds. 
 
4.2.4.3. Closed P-clauses are echoic 
 
As is clear from the various examples given so far, closed P-clauses are always echoic in one sense or 
another. They can echo straightforward statements about the actual world, or they can echo Q-propositions 
about a nonfactual world. However, the claim that closed P-propositions are echoic need not mean that they 

have to be echoes of actual utterances. They may also be echoes of an internal or mental proposition 
(thought) such as the interpretation of an experience, perception, etc.:12 
(136) 
 
a. 
(watching the clock)  If it’s already 8.45, I’d better hurry up. 
 
 
b. 
(addressing someone ostentatiously turning his back to the speaker)  If that’s how you feel, 
there’s nothing more to be said.  (The P-clause echoes an interpretation, i.e. a proposition 
existing in the speaker’s mind.) 
Closed P-clauses that echo statements about the actual world are often confused with factual P-clauses. 
However, such closed P-clauses are not factual in the sense that they imply that the fulfilment of the 
condition is a fact: they only imply that the speaker takes this for granted or purports to do so. A closed-P 
conditional always has an element of ‘suspending disbelief’ about it, i.e. the speaker is willing to assume P as 
true, but is not necessarily committed to its truth.13 
 
4.2.4.4. Functional types of closed-P conditionals 
 
We have found four functional types of conditional that have or can have a closed P-clause: ‘premodified 
reduced it-clefts’, ‘nonassertoric-Q-utterance conditionals’, indirect inferentials and direct inferentials. 
(a) Premodified reduced it-clefts are discussed in section 11.14.4. They form a class of specificational (see 
section 3.14) sentence, in which the P-clause serves to introduce a variable and the Q-clause is a reduced it-
cleft specifying a value for that variable, as in If anyone can do it, it’s you (where the P-clause introduces the 
variable ‘the x who can do it’ and the Q-clause specifies the value ‘you’ for that variable). A premodified 
reduced it-cleft can be a closed-P conditional: If, as you say, one of them is a traitor, it’s Jonathan. [I’ve 
never trusted him.] In this example, the speaker presupposes that there is an ‘x who is a traitor’, hence that 
the condition expressed by the if-clause is fulfilled (closed). 
(b) ‘Nonassertoric-Q-utterance conditionals’ are discussed in section 10.1.5. They are ‘rhetorical’ (non-case-
specifying) conditionals in which the P-clause expresses the reason why the speaker utters a nonassertoric Q-
clause, i.e. a Q-clause which is not an assertion but a question, directive, etc. 
(137) 
 
a. 
[“This painting is a Gainsborough.”] — “If this painting is a Gainsborough, why isn’t it 
electronically protected?” 
 
 
b. 
[“I’m feeling sick.”] — “If you’re feeling sick you’d better go outside and lie down.” 
 
 
c. 
[“Elvis Presley was not a politician.” — “Right.] But if he was not a politician, how come 
people refer to him as ‘the King’?” 
Such conditionals have a P-clause that is echoic and hence closed. 
(c) Indirect inferentials (e.g. If that’s a Rembrandt, I’m Shakespeare) also have a P-clause that is echoic and 
closed. 
(d) The vast majority of closed-P conditionals are direct inferentials. (However, not all direct inferentials 
have a closed P-clause. For example, the P-clause is open in [Find out whether Green is left-handed, and where 
he was on Saturday evening.] If he’s left-handed and he doesn’t have an alibi for the hours of nine to eleven on 
Saturday evening, he’s our man.) The fact that most closed-P conditionals are direct inferentials is natural, since 
a closed condition is necessarily concerned with (the assumption of) truth. For example: 
(138) 
 
[“This one was painted by Renoir.”] — “If this is a Renoir, it must be worth a fortune!.” 
                                              
12. It is not clear to us whether the latter possibility invalidates Comrie’s (1982: 148) and Dancygier’s (1988b: 124) 
claim that a closed P-clause is always “contextually given”. Everything depends on how ‘given’ is defined. 
13. Dancygier & Mioduszewska (1984: 128) are therefore mistaken when they consider the P-clause in examples like 
the following to have a “factual meaning”: 
 
(i) 
[“John told me you are getting married.” — “Nonsense!] If he told you that, he was lying.” 
 
(ii) [“I am afraid you will not understand his reaction.” — “But I know his character!”] — “Well, if you know 
his character, you will understand his reaction.” 
 
Funk (1985: 372) calls the P-clause of such examples “neutral”. (From this we can only conclude that Funk’s 
definition of “neutral” condition[al clause] is quite different from ours.) 

It is only in direct inferentials that the closed P-clause may be echoic in a nonliteral sense, i.e. may be the 
echo of an internal or mental proposition (thought) such as the interpretation of an experience, perception, 
etc. It follows that closed-P direct inferentials form the only type of closed-P conditional that can express 
‘internal speech / thought’ (which is not the same thing as ‘free indirect speech’). We speak of ‘internal 
speech / thought’ when the speaker does not address anyone else, but speaks to herself, or when the sentence 
is the linguistic expression of a thought which does not lead to a real utterance. For example: 
(139) 
 
(context: the speaker hears the clock chiming 11 and draws the following mental conclusion)  
If it’s as late as that, it’s high time I went to bed. 
It is important to see that in (139) the speaker uses a closed P-clause in spite of the fact that she knows that 
the condition is fulfilled. The premise of the inferential is not the fact that the clock chimes 11 but the 
speaker’s interpretation (internalization) of this fact. As a matter of fact, it has already been noted that a 
direct inferential never has a factual P-clause. In direct inferentials, the P-clause is always theoretical 
(nonfactual): in (139) it is not important whether the P-proposition is true in the actual world or not; what 
matters is that the P-proposition is assumed to be true for the sake of the mental argument—see also section 
4.1.5 above. 
The claims we have made about the above types (a)-(d) explain the difference between the following 
examples: 
(140) 
 
a. 
[“Mummy, the milkman’s here.”] — “If the milkman’s here, open the door for him.” 
 
 
b. 
(seeing the milkman coming up the drive)  *If the milkman’s here, open the door for him. 
 
 
c. 
(seeing the milkman coming up the drive)  If the milkman’s here, it must be later than I 
thought. 
In (140a), the mother presumably accepts that it is a fact that the milkman is there. (Another possibility is 
that the speaker knows that the child is only pretending and decides to go along with her. In that case the P-
clause is ‘ostensibly closed’.) However, if the mother accepts that the milkman is there, she does not do so on 
the basis of first-hand knowledge (i.e. her own perception): she relies on the information given by her child. 
In other words, the P-clause is echoic and hence closed. Because of this, the sentence is impeccable as a 
nonassertoric-Q-utterance conditional. Sentence (140b), however, is uttered by a mother who sees the 
milkman at her door and therefore knows that the milkman is there. The P-clause is therefore factual, which 
means that the conditional cannot be a nonassertoric-Q-utterance conditional. It follows that the conditional 
is unacceptable in this context. (It cannot be salvaged by treating the factual P-clause as if it were the closed 
P-clause of an inferential. As was explained in section 3.2, an inferential conditional is concerned with the 
truth of Q. This means that a conditional is not an inferential if the Q-clause is an imperative: a command 
does not have a truth value. The Q-clause expressing an inference must be assertoric, and that is not the case 
in [140b]. This conditional can therefore not be interpreted as an inferential.) 
The fact that a sentence like If the milkman is here, open the door for him is unacceptable if the speaker 
actually sees the milkman was first pointed out (with reference to a similar example) by Akatsuka (1986: 
342). However, Akatsuka did not notice that a sentence like (140c) is impeccable, although it is again on the 
basis of her own perception that the speaker accepts that it is a fact that the milkman is there. (The P-clause is 
echoic in the sense that it is an echo of an internal or mental proposition [thought], in this case the 
interpretation of a perception.) The reason why (140c) is acceptable is that it is an inferential conditional 
representing internal speech / thought, in other words, a closed-P inferential, not a factual-P conditional. 
The same principles account for the acceptability of the following: 
(141) 
 
a. 
If he isn’t happy—and he obviously isn’t—it’s because of his marriage, surely. 
 
 
b. 
[“Mummy, I’m hungry.”] — “If you’re hungry, eat a sandwich.” 
 
 
c. 
If that man is going to be our Saviour, I’m the Fairy Queen! 
 
 
d. 
(on seeing the milkman arrive)  If the milkman’s already here, it’s high time {I / you} left for 
the office. 
All these P-clauses refer to factual situations, but they are treated as expressing a closed supposition. As we 
have seen, this processing of a present fact as a closed supposition is only possible in four types of 
conditionals, which are indicated as (a)-(d) above. The first type is that illustrated by (141a), which is a 
‘premodified reduced it-cleft’. The second type, illustrated by (141b) consists of nonassertoric-Q-utterance 

conditionals. The third type, illustrated by (141c), consists of indirect inferentials. The fourth type, illustrated 
by (141d) consists of direct inferentials which are used in internal speech / thought. 
The following provide some further illustrations of closed-P conditionals: 
(142) 
 
a. 
[“I know he’s got a lot of money.”] — “If he has a lot of money, he must have a big 
house.”  (inferential) 
 
 
b. 
[“I know he’s got a lot of money.”] — “If he has a lot of money, what does he do with it?”  
(nonassertoric-Q-utterance conditional) 
 
 
c. 
[“When exactly?”] (If Morse could ask such questions, why not Lewis?)  (DOC) (inferential 
because the Q-clause is a rhetorical question: ‘why not Lewis?’ is read as ‘Lewis too could 
ask such questions’) 
 
 
d. 
[“You’re ever so late, Ted. What time is it?” — “Twelve, is it?” — “It’s far later than that.”] 
— “If you know what the bloody time is, why the ‘ell do you ask me in the first place?”  
(DOC) (inferential because the Q-clause is a rhetorical question: the message is ‘there is no 
point in asking me what the time is’) 
 
 
e. 
If it’s Tuesday, is this Brussels?  (inferential when interpreted as ‘...this is Brussels, isn’t it?’) 
 
 
f. 
[“There was trouble in the pub yesterday. Were you responsible?”] — “If there was trouble, it 
wasn’t because of me. [I wasn’t there.]”  (premodified reduced it-cleft) 
The claims we have made in this section are in keeping with the fact that (143) (with a nonassertoric 
interrogative Q-clause) is not acceptable. Nonassertoric questions have no truth value, hence they cannot be 
the Q-clause of an inferential. However, it is only in inferentials that a fact is treated as a closed condition. 
(143) 
 
(If the speaker has seen the milkman coming)  *If the milkman’s here, who will open the door 
for him? 
This sentence should be compared with (144), where the P-clause is closed (since the speaker relies on her 
child’s authority), and which is therefore impeccable as a nonassertoric-Q-utterance conditional: 
(144) 
 
[“Mummy, the milkman’s here.”] — “If the milkman’s here, who will open the door for him?” 
The following sentences offer further evidence in support of our analysis: 
(145) 
 
a. 
(If the speaker has seen the milkman coming)  *If the milkman’s here, Jenny will open 
the door for him. 
 
 
b. 
(id.)  If the milkman’s here, Jenny will be opening the door for him. 
 
 
c. 
(id.)  If the milkman’s here, Jenny will open the door for him and then the cat will stop 
mewing to be let in. 
Sentence (145a) is unacceptable, despite the Q-clause being an assertion, because the Q-clause expresses 
either a directive or a pure prediction about actualization, not an inference. It is only in direct inferentials that 
a fact can be treated as a closed-P assumption. On the other hand, (145b) does work, because of the epistemic 
value of the progressive with will. As is well-known—see e.g. Declerck (1991b: 165)—the future 
progressive can be used to suggest that the action referred to is performed as a matter of course, i.e. that it 
belongs to the expected course of events. There is a clear epistemic element (predictability) in such an 
interpretation. Sentence (145c) also works fine, because of its inferential quality: the sentence refers to 
situations which form part of a habitual pattern, so that the actualization of the P-situation is sufficient 
grounds for concluding that the other situations are going to follow. 
It should be clear from this that we use ‘inferential’ in the narrow sense of ‘truth-inferential’. It could be 
argued that in If she is in London now, go to see her at once! the speaker infers from the assumed truth of P 
to the necessity of performing the illocutionary speech act of giving an order. However, it has already been 
pointed out that this is not the approach taken here. In our analysis, the Q-clause of an inferential must have a truth 
value, and must therefore be assertoric. Conditionals expressing a relation between the assumed truth of P 
and the necessity of performing a directive speech act Q are nonassertoric-Q-utterance conditionals, not 
inferentials. 
This is not to say that the Q-clause of an inferential conditional can never express deontic modality. Some 
clauses with a deontic meaning do have a truth value. Consider: 
(146) 
 
a. 
If yoghurt is good for my stomach I {must / should} eat it more often.  (Here the Q-
clause expresses a conclusion concerning the deontic necessity of performing the Q-situation. 

In other words, Q is not a directive or command but the statement ‘it is necessary for me to 
eat yoghurt more often.’) 
 
 
b. 
(on seeing the milkman arrive)  If the milkman is already here, {I should hurry up. / I’d better 
hurry up. / *hurry up, girl. / *let’s hurry up. / *why not hurry up?}. 
 
4.2.4.5. Modalizers in the Q-clause of a closed-P conditional 
 
In inferential conditionals, Q, and in some cases P, may be either a positive (=true) or negative (=false) 
proposition, but they may also have an epistemic value lying between these poles. In that case the relevant 
clause contains an epistemic modal auxiliary (must, might...) or modal adverb (probably, possibly...). 
Compare: 
(147) 
 
a. 
If (as you say, and I accept) John must have done it, then none of the others can have 
done it. 
 
 
b. 
If (as you say) John {can’t / needn’t} have done it, then Bill {may / must} have done it. 
 
 
c. 
If he {is probably / may perhaps be} a paedophile, we’d better keep the children away from 
him. 
 
 
d. 
If (as you say is probable) John is the murderer, then he may {perhaps / possibly} have killed 
other people too. 
 
 
e. 
If (as you say is probable) John is the murderer, then he has {certainly / probably / 
undoubtedly} killed other people too. 
A condition for the use of an epistemic modalizer in a P-clause is that the latter be echoic. As we have seen, 
closed P-clauses are always echoic in some sense or another. This condition is stricter, however, when the P-
clause contains an epistemic auxiliary or adverb: in that case the P-clause must echo a preceding statement 
(though not necessarily literally: [“Pauline might be here tomorrow.”] — “Well, if it’s possible that Pauline will be 
here tomorrow, I’ll postpone sending this parcel to her). 
The possibility of having an epistemic modalizer in the Q-clause is in keeping with the observation that a 
closed P-clause can combine with a Q-clause expressing a particular epistemic modality, viz. possibility, 
unlikelihood or counterfactuality. That is, a closed P-clause can combine with an open, tentative or 
counterfactual Q-clause (or, more correctly, with a Q-clause implying a covert open, tentative or 
counterfactual P-clause): 
(148) 
 
a. 
If John has been unable to do it, then none of the others will manage to do it.  (covert 
condition: e.g. if they try) 
 
 
b. 
If John has been unable to do it, then none of the others would manage to do it.  (covert 
condition: e.g. if they tried) 
 
 
c. 
If that’s supposed to be a bloody insult, mister, you couldn’t a’ done much bleedin’ better, 
could you?  (DOC) (covert condition: e.g. if you’d tried) 
Since closed P-clauses can echo a statement about any kind of world, they can contain nonepistemic 
auxiliaries too: If, as you say, he {must / has got to} be at home by ten, he’d better hurry up. 
 
4.2.4.6. Ostensibly closed P-clauses 
 
In some closed-P conditionals the speaker does not really assume that P is true in the actual world but 
pretends to do so for the sake of the argument. This possibility of using a closed conditional with only 
ostensible or feigned assumption of the truth of P is illustrated by examples like the following: 
(149) 
 
a. 
If, as you told me, you made such a big impression on that woman, why did she just walk 
straight past you? 
 
 
b. 
If, as you say, you will be filming in Hollywood next month, why did I see you sending off 
job applications today? 
 
 
c. 
[“Germany didn’t invade Poland until October.”] — “If Hitler didn’t invade Poland until then, 
why did we go to war on September 3rd?”  (adapted from Smith [1983: 21], who calls the 
reading ‘factual’) 

(150) 
 
[“We’re still in Belgium, are we?”] — “Yes, if Amsterdam is in Belgium, we’re still in 
Belgium.” (Dik 1990: 248) 
In (149a-c) the speaker presents Q as puzzling in the light of a P that she purports to believe is true. However, it is 
clear that the speaker actually accepts Q and therefore rejects P. All indirect inferentials make use of this 
mechanism. On the other hand, (150) is not an indirect inferential. What is happening here (in Dik’s view) is 
that the speaker finds the P-proposition so obviously false (and therefore the hearer’s question so obviously 
foolish) that she does not bother to correct it but follows the hearer in drawing the false conclusion Q (thus 
producing a direct inferential). In doing so she is being sarcastic (i.e. fooling the hearer), assuming as she 
does that every normal person will know what the addressee apparently does not know, viz. that P is 
blatantly false. (It should be noted, however, that [150] is a quite normal closed-P inferential if the speaker 
does not know that Amsterdam isn’t in Belgium.) 
Needless to say, the use of conditionals that are only ostensibly closed-P is not fundamentally different 
from other uses of closed-P conditionals. It is especially the pragmatic context that determines whether a 
closed condition is interpreted as ‘really closed’ or as ‘ostensibly closed’. Thus in If Jack’s coming 
tomorrow, there’s no point in posting the parcel to him, the speaker apparently treats P as true in the real 
world and draws a conclusion from the premise that P is true in the real world. In this case the conclusion is 
‘there’s no point in posting the parcel to him’, which suggests that the speaker is deciding her future actions 
on the basis of P, and therefore not only treats P as true for the purposes of imagining a world in which it is 
true and drawing conclusions from that scenario, but also (incidentally) thinks it really is true. But note that 
the same sentence could easily be uttered by a speaker who does not believe the news (that Jack is coming 
tomorrow) but uses the sentence as a way of testing the validity of the news. Thus, if the addressee is the 
person who has delivered the news, and if the addressee is known to have a strong interest in the parcel’s 
being posted today, the speaker can utter the sentence with a view to testing the addressee’s honesty. (If the 
addressee has been lying, then his interest in the parcel getting posted may prompt him to admit that he does 
not really know that Jack is coming tomorrow.) In this case too, P is treated as true and Q is drawn as a 
conclusion. 
 
4.2.5. Open-P conditionals 
 
Here the theoretical world called up by the case-specifying P-clause is assumed to be such that it may or may 
not turn out to correspond with the actual world. It follows that the P-clause often refers to the future: since 
the future is unknown, the P-situation and the Q-situation are easily viewed as an ‘open possibility’ (i.e. as 
neither certain, nor probable, nor unlikely). 
(151) 
 
a. 
If the train is late, we will miss our connection in London. 
 
 
b. 
[I’ve been told that] it will be worth a lot more if we can get his signature on it.  (COB-S) 
 
 
c. 
If the full committee accepts the proposals which include restructuring of the union’s 
executive on November 17, then the planned special general meeting in January becomes a 
marketing exercise.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
If Celtic emerge from the game tomorrow still at least three points in front, it will give them a 
huge lift for the remaining games.  (COB-W) 
Note, however, that we can also apply the term ‘open condition’ to P-propositions about a past, pre-present 
or present P-situation, provided the speaker is not certain about whether the P-situation has actualized or not. 
As we have seen, if the speaker does not know, or is not certain, whether a P-proposition about a nonfuture 
situation is true or false in the actual world, the P-clause may have a neutral theoretical meaning (i.e. the 
speaker just makes a theoretical supposition without assuming any link between this theoretical world and 
the actual world) or a closed theoretical meaning (i.e. the speaker treats the supposition as true), but it may 
also convey the speaker’s assumption that there is a real possibility that the supposition will turn out to be 
factual in the actual world. The three possibilities are illustrated by the following examples: 
(152) 
 
a. 
(from advertisement)  If you haven’t got a life insurance policy yet, you’d better read the 
following text carefully.  (neutral-P) 
 
 
b. 
[“Churchill was not a true conservative.”] — “If he was not a true conservative, what was 
he?”  (closed-P: even though the speaker may well not be sure that the claim to which he is 
replying is true, the implication is ‘if we suppose that that is true, then what...?’) 

 
 
c. 
[I don’t know if Liverpool won their match yesterday.] If they did, they must be top of the 
League now.  (open-P) 
 
 
d. 
[“I think that man may be a plainclothes policeman.”] — “If he is, I wonder what he is doing 
here.”  (open-P) 
Examples like these differ from open-P conditionals referring to the future in that the question mark inherent 
in ‘if’ has a pragmatic origin: it is due to lack of knowledge on the part of the speaker. However, the answer 
to the question is already known to whoever is well-informed: it is either yes or no. By contrast, in an open 
conditional about the future the question mark inherent in ‘if’ is due to the semantics of the future: the future 
is by definition nonfactual. According to Dowty (1979: 151), the time-line is a single line up to the time of 
speech, but ‘branches’ from that point onwards: the future does not consist of a single factual course of 
events but of many theoretical courses of events, only one of which will turn out to be factual as the time of 
speech progresses along the time-line. When locating the P-situation of an open-P conditional in the future, 
the speaker assumes that the course of events that she is selecting is a real candidate for becoming the new 
extension of the time-line. That is, an open-P conditional about the future implies that the speaker does more 
than just make a guess (supposition): she also assumes that the course of events selected is a real possibility. 
(However, this is not the only possible assumption. The speaker may also assume that the course of events 
selected will be the correct one [=closed P-proposition], or that it is unlikely to become factual [=tentative P-
proposition], or that it will definitely not become factual [=counterfactual P-proposition].) 
The openness of a condition—i.e. the fact that its fulfilment is just seen as a possibility—can be stressed 
by putting the nuclear accent of the if-clause on if. Doing so often goes together with a repetition of the P-
clause: 
(153) 
 
a. 
“I will speak to him when he comes.” — “IF he comes!” 
 
 
b. 
“Not even the time she was in the bath?” — “If she was in the bath.”  (DOC) 
 
 
c. 
When Kim comes, IF she comes, I will question her thoroughly. 
In all of these, the emphasis on uncertainty is partly achieved by the repetition, contrasting a factual clause 
with a repetition of itself with (effectively) just one alteration, which is therefore particularly salient. Without 
repetition, the emphasis on uncertainty is still there, but not as salient: 
(154) 
IF John comes tonight, I’ll speak to him. 
Let us complete this section on open-P conditionals with two further remarks. Firstly, as noted by Bolinger 
(1977: 30), there is a strong similarity between open conditional clauses and open questions in that both are 
nonassertive. This is clear e.g. from the use of any rather than some as unmarked pronominal form. (Compare 
Does it make any difference? with If it makes any difference...) Secondly, when we say that an open-P 
conditional represents the actualization of the P-situation as ‘possible’, we refer to only one of the two well-
known meanings of ‘possibility’, viz. the readings which Leech (1971) has called ‘theoretical’ and ‘factual’. 
Factual possibility is an epistemic modality: we speak about the chances that a situation actualizes. This is 
the case, e.g. in The road may be blocked, which (in nonformal English) is understood as ‘It is possible that 
the road {is / will be} blocked’, ‘Perhaps the road {is / will be} blocked.’ Theoretical possibility is expressed 
by The road can be blocked, which means ‘It is theoretically possible to block the road’, ‘The road is 
blockable’. This kind of possibility is not epistemic. In open-P conditionals, the possibility expressed in the 
P-clause is always of the factual (epistemic) type. This is the case even in If the road can be blocked, they 
will do it. If this is read as ‘The road is blockable, so I predict that they will block it’, the conditional is 
treated as a closed-P conditional. When read as an open-P conditional, the sentence means ‘If, as may or may 
not be the case, the road is blockable, then if it is blockable it will be blocked.’ In this case the P-clause 
clearly speaks about the factual possibility of the actualization of a theoretically possible situation. The 
conditional can be paraphrased: ‘It may or may not be the case that the road is blockable; if it is, it will be 
blocked.’ This is the same kind of paraphrase as is suitable for If she comes, I will be happy. 
 
4.2.6. Tentative-P conditionals 
 
4.2.6.1. Definition 
 

The basic meaning of these conditionals is that the theoretical P-world is assumed to be such that it might 
correspond with the actual world, but that this possibility is considered as rather unlikely (but not impossible) 
to be (or to have been or to come) true. See also Van der Auwera (1983: 297), who speaks of conditionals 
with a “problematical” reading, and Iatridou (2000: 234), who speaks of “future less vivid conditionals” and 
says that they implicate that the P-world is more likely to become false than to become true in the actual 
world. (From our point of view, the “future less vivid” label is actually infelicitous, since tentative-P 
conditionals may sometimes also refer to the present—see below.) Compare: 
(155) 
 
a. 
If he does that, he will be in real trouble.  (open-P) 
 
 
b. 
If he {did / were to do} that, he would be in real trouble.  (tentative-P: the P-actualization is 
contrary to expectation) 
As noted in section 1.3.6, many people call (155b) “hypothetical” instead of ‘tentative’. However, we have 
preferred not to follow this convention in the present book because “hypothetical” is used differently (and in 
various different senses) by many other people and because its use in the sense of ‘tentative’ runs counter to 
its every-day sense of ‘making a hypothesis (supposition)’. All theoretical-P conditionals are hypothetical 
(suppositional) in the latter sense, because they refer to a theoretical world. (In every-day speech 
‘hypothetical’ can therefore refer, for example, to counterfactual situations: [I know he isn’t here. But] 
hypothetically speaking, if he was here he would be a great help.) 
Like open-P conditionals, tentative-P conditionals usually refer to the future, as in I would be happy if he 
resigned: the future is by definition unknown, so both P and (in most cases) Q can be viewed as possible but 
unlikely. However, reference to the present is also possible. Compare: 
(156) 
 
a. 
If the world was hit by a meteor of that size, all life on earth would be destroyed.  (P-
clause referring to future time) 
 
 
b. 
If our train were to arrive late, we might miss our plane.  (P-clause referring to future time) 
 
 
c. 
I would be surprised if that man over there were the man we’re looking for.  (P-clause 
referring to present time, albeit with an implication of finding out about the man’s identity in 
the future) 
However, unlike open-P conditionals, tentative-P conditionals cannot refer to the past. The following 
examples (which have the form of pattern 2—see 3.15) all pose a problem: 
(157) 
 
a. 
If the world had been hit by a meteor of that size yesterday, all life on earth would have 
been destroyed.  (This conditional is read as counterfactual-P, not tentative-P.) 
 
 
b. 
*If our train were to have arrived late just now, we might miss our plane. 
 
 
c. 
*If he were ill yesterday, he might catch up with his work tomorrow. 
A final note concerns the theoretical status of the tentativeness conveyed by conditionals like (157a). 
According to Iatridou (2000: 234), the “future less vivid” meaning of these conditionals is an implicature, 
witness the fact that “it remains unaffected by negation”: 
(158) 
 
a. 
If he took the syrup he would get better. 
 
 
b. 
It is not the case that if he took the syrup, he would get better. 
However, there are problems with this argument. Firstly, it is not implicatures but presuppositions that are 
known not to be affected by (nonmetalinguistic) sentence negation. Secondly, the way Iatridou uses the 
negation test in (158b) runs counter to the following claim which she makes on the same page: 
 What is remote [in this type of conditional] are the p cases, not the p—q relationship. In other words, 
(158a) conveys the meaning that the patient is less likely to drink the syrup than to not drink it. (158a) 
does not mean that the drinking of the syrup and the healing are less likely to cooccur than to not 
cooccur. That is, (158a) does not mean that p and q are less likely to cooccur than to not cooccur.  (p. 
234) [reference number adapted] 
If this remark is correct, the negation test should not make use of external negation (of the entire ‘if P, Q’ 
conditional), as in (158b), but should be based on (internal) negation of the P-clause only. A third problem 
for Iatridou’s claim that the “unlikelihood” that is inherent in examples like (158a) is an implicature is her 
own assertion (p. 234) that this idea cannot be cancelled: 
(159) 
 
*If John came to the party, and I think he will, we would have a great time. 

As is well-known, it is typical of implicatures that they can be cancelled. 
As we have already argued, our view is that the various meanings of nonfactual-P conditionals (viz. 
neutral-P, closed-P, open-P, tentative-P and counterfactual-P conditionals) are assumed (presupposed) by the 
speaker to be valid. These meanings are not cancellable implicatures but presuppositions to which the 
speaker is (at least ostensibly) committed. 
 
4.2.6.2. Other forms of tentativeness 
 
Apart from its basic meaning (viz. the theoretical world is assumed to be such that it might correspond with 
the actual world, but this possibility is considered as unlikely to be or to become the case), a conditional of 
the form of a tentative-P conditional may be selected for reasons of tentativeness of a different type, viz. 
modesty, tact, politeness. This is the case, for example, in the following conditionals, which are used to 
suggest a course of action, and could in principle be replaced by open-P conditionals (which, however, would 
make the suggestion much more directly): 
(160) 
 
a. 
[It’s up to you, of course, but] if we left immediately after breakfast we would reach the 
cottage by lunch-time. 
 
 
b. 
It would be nice if you helped your mother clean the house.  (tentative suggestion; in 
sentences like these, tentativeness is conventionalized to a point that it would be difficult to 
use ‘will’ instead of ‘would’.) 
 
 
c. 
If we phoned the police they might be able to tell us what to do. 
 
 
d. 
[Why take a taxi?] It would be much cheaper if you used the underground. 
Requests are another type of sentence in which the use of such tentative forms is very natural: 
(161) 
 
a. 
Would it be all right if I borrowed your typewriter for half an hour? 
 
 
b. 
It would be nice if you could give me a hand tomorrow. 
In (160)-(161), representing P and Q as remote possibilities is a strategy to render the suggestion or request 
more tentative and therefore more face-saving if the reply should be negative. 
This analysis of examples like (160)-(161) runs counter to Harder’s (1996) claim that (what we call) 
tentative-P and counterfactual-P conditionals are different in quality, not in quantity of likelihood, from 
open-P, etc. conditionals. Harder adduces the following argument to make his point: 
Consider the case of a shy admirer saying If I asked you out, would you come? Has s/he thereby 
become committed to this being necessarily a remote possibility? I think this would be a bad 
characterization of the situation. In the happy case where the answer is Of course I would, silly! it 
would be rather surprising if the speaker did not in fact proceed to make the if-clause true; and that 
may well have been the intention.  (Harder 1996: 456-7) 
In our opinion, there is something wrong with this. The argument seems to be either that if we use a certain 
form to refer to a possible situation, then the way in which that situation actualizes should characterize the 
meaning of the form or that if we say a form has a certain meaning, then the speaker who uses that form must 
believe that what she refers to actually does fit exactly that meaning. Either way, Harder seems to be denying 
the possibility of acting, i.e. of using language that carries certain connotations in order to achieve an effect. 
If a speaker says to someone I don’t suppose I could borrow fifty pence, could I? in the knowledge that the 
answer is almost bound to be ‘yes’ because the amount is small, this does not mean that the meaning 
expressed by the past tense morpheme in could, by the ‘I don’t suppose’-construction and by the tag is ‘near 
certainty’. All these features still mean ‘polite tentativeness’ irrespective of the speaker’s success in getting 
her request met. We agree that in saying I don’t suppose I could borrow fifty pence, could I? the speaker is 
not committed to it being a remote possibility that she can borrow fifty pence. However, we do not see how 
the forms for polite tentativeness can be used unless there is a mutual agreement that at least at some 
(constant) level they mean remote possibility. (This is in keeping with the observation that for some speakers 
of English, at least, it is easier to answer Well, I’d rather you didn’t to Would you mind if I opened the 
window? than to Do you mind if I open the window?) 
When a conditional of the form of a tentative-P conditional (=pattern 2) is used for the sake of this kind of 
tentativeness, there is not always a corresponding pattern 1 open-P conditional. Compare: 
(162) 
 
a. 
I think it’d be an idea if we had the meeting at our house.  (COB-S) (tentative) 

 
 
b. 
??I think it’ll be an idea if we have the meeting at our house.  (nontentative) 
 
 
c. 
I think it’s an idea if we have the meeting at our house. 
In some cases, the tentative version virtually has to be used because the alternative version is found to be 
rather impolite: 
(163) 
 
a. 
Would you mind if I used your phone?  (polite request: asking for permission) 
 
 
b. 
{?Will you / Do you} mind if I use your phone?  (This is a more direct request, which is 
inappropriate if the circumstances are not suited to informality. My saying to a complete 
stranger ‘Do you mind if I use your phone?’ is all right, for example, if my house is on fire, 
but it will sound rude in many other circumstances because it suggests that I am going to use 
your phone anyhow.) 
 
4.2.6.3. Indirect tentative-P conditionals: the type I wouldn’t be surprised if he came 
 
In Transformational Generative Grammar it was assumed that I don’t think he is ill is derived from I think he 
isn’t ill by a transformation variously called ‘Neg-raising’, ‘Negation transfer’ or ‘Negative transportation’. 
Though this analysis is now generally rejected, it is a fact that I don’t think he is ill is conventionally 
interpreted as virtually equivalent to I think he isn’t ill. The only difference between them is that the former 
implies some uncertainty on the part of the speaker, while the latter does not. This follows from the fact that I 
don’t think he is ill presents what the speaker thinks in a form suggesting that it is what he does not think—
see Declerck (1995b: 86). 
We can observe a similar alternation in some tentative-P conditionals: in some contexts, I wouldn’t be 
surprised if he came receives much the same interpretation as (more specifically: is interpreted as an 
understatement version of) I’d be surprised if he didn’t come. This is the case, for example, in I wouldn’t be 
surprised if he came round that corner right now — there, see, I told you so, that’s him. 
In the same way as the pattern I don’t think... is possible with some cognition verbs only—it is fine with 
think, believe, expect, fancy, imagine, reckon, but not with assume, hope, presume, surmise—the pattern I 
wouldn’t be surprised... is heavily restricted. (In fact, we have found no examples with predicates other than 
be surprised.) What is interesting about I wouldn’t be surprised if he came is that it would seem to lack the 
tentative-P status of I’d be surprised if he didn’t come. The latter is a regular tentative-P conditional in which 
the actualization of P (‘he not come’) is seen as rather unlikely, so that the actualization of Q (‘I be 
surprised’) is also interpreted as unlikely. By contrast, interpreting I wouldn’t be surprised if he came as a 
regular tentative-P conditional would mean that both the actualization of P (‘he come’) and the actualization 
of Q (‘I not be surprised’) were interpreted as unlikely. Such an interpretation would mean that we 
considered ‘he not come’ and ‘I be surprised’ as quite likely. However, on the relevant interpretation, I 
wouldn’t be surprised if he came actually means that the speaker does NOT consider it likely that ‘he’ will not 
come and that she (=the speaker) will be surprised at that. That is, on this interpretation I wouldn’t be 
surprised if he came is more or less equivalent to I’d be surprised if he didn’t come. 
These data can be accommodated in two ways. On the one hand, one can assume that Neg-raising exists, 
not as a syntactic transformation, but as the phenomenon that with some predicates there is near-synonymy 
between ‘positive head clause + negative subclause’ and ‘negative head clause + positive subclause’. The 
fact that this is only possible with some predicates lends support to this analysis. On the other hand, it could 
be argued that in I wouldn’t be surprised if he came, the meaning of the head clause is such that it changes 
the meaning of the subclause from ‘unlikely’ to ‘likely’. This would mean that the tentative-P meaning is 
wiped out, but that the conditional continues to be of the formal type that is typically used to convey a 
tentative-P meaning, viz. pattern 2. The near-synonymy between the two structures then follows naturally 
from the fact that P is [-p] when the tentativeness is not wiped out and [+p] when it is. 
However this may be—the one analysis actually does not exclude the other—we will treat I wouldn’t be 
surprised if he came on a par with I’d be surprised if he didn’t come. There seems to be no point in treating 
the former structure (which is only possible with surprised) as a separate type of theoretical-P conditional, 
even though it would in theory be nice if the gradient closed-open-unlikely-counterfactual should be 
‘completed’ into closed-likely-open-unlikely-counterfactual. 
In what follows, I wouldn’t be surprised if he came will be referred to as an ‘indirect tentative-P 
conditional’. This is in keeping with the fact that the conditional is ultimately interpreted as equivalent to the 
tentative-P conditional I’d be surprised if he didn’t come. 

 
4.2.7. Counterfactual-P conditionals 
 
4.2.7.1. Definition 
 
A conditional is counterfactual-P if the theoretical P-world is assumed to be contrary to fact, i.e. to be 
definitely different from the actual world (or, if the reference is to the future, from what is going to become 
the actual world). Thus, in I would have been happy if she had come, P is presupposed to be true in a 
counterfactual theoretical P-world but false in the actual world.14 Like ‘open-P’ and ‘tentative-P’, the term 
‘counterfactual-P’ thus refers to a presupposition concerning the truth relation between the propositions 
describing a theoretical P-world and the propositions describing the actual world. (The reason why we speak 
of ‘P-world’ is that the Q-proposition of a counterfactual-P conditional is not necessarily contrary to fact. As 
will be argued in sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3, if Q is true in a counterfactual P-world, then it is by implicature 
interpreted as false in the actual world. However, there are cases in which this implicature is blocked or 
cancelled.) 
 
4.2.7.2. Counterfactual patterns 
 
There are several types of conditionals that receive a counterfactual-P interpretation. To begin with, 
conditionals of the canonical tense pattern 2 (see section 3.15) can be counterfactual if the P-clause refers to 
the present: 
(164) 
 
a. 
If I were you, I wouldn’t go there. 
 
 
b. 
He would make more progress if he were using a computer. 
 
 
c. 
If you weren’t such a blockhead you would be much easier to work with. 
The conditions under which the P-clause of a pattern 2 conditional can refer to the present will be 
investigated in section 5.7.3. 
Secondly, conditionals of the canonical tense pattern 3 are mostly interpreted as counterfactual. As in the 
other nonneutral-theoretical-P conditionals, the P-clause may (under certain conditions—see section 5.7.2) 
refer to any time, even though it is in the past perfect tense: 
(165) 
 
a. 
If he had not tampered with the machine, it would not have broken down.  (past P-
situation) 
 
 
b. 
If you had been an engineer, you could have solved this difficult problem.  (present P-
situation) 
 
 
c. 
If you had come tomorrow instead of today, you would not have found me at home.  (future P-
situation) 
Thirdly, as was noted in section 4.2.4, the P-clauses of ad absurdum conditionals and other indirect 
inferentials are (ostensibly) closed rather than counterfactual at first sight but are re-interpreted as 
counterfactual on hearing the Q-clause: 
(166) 
 
a. 
If you’re the General Manager here, I’m Dracula! 
 
 
b. 
If, as you say, he is as poor as a churchmouse, how come he owns a brand new Mercedes? 
 
4.2.7.3. Counteridentical-P conditionals 
 
An interesting subclass of counterfactual-P conditionals is that in which the P-clause identifies two 
incompatible entities with each other, as in if I were you, if Bill had been Kim, etc. In such conditionals, 
which Goodman (1991) calls “counteridenticals”, the P-situation is not only presented as counterfactual but 
is inherently counterfactual for pragmatic reasons. What is interesting about these examples is the questions 
they raise in connection with deictic reference. Let us start with some simple examples: 
                                              
14. See also Brée (1982: 163): “A counterfactual presupposes the falsity of its antecedent. It is inappropriate for a 
speaker to use the counterfactual unless he believes that the antecedent is false; so the listener may take it for 
granted that the speaker wishes to indicate that it is indeed false.” 

(167) 
 
a. 
I {would / should} reconsider my assumptions if I were you. 
 
 
b. 
[I know what a terrible childhood you’ve had.] I wouldn’t want to remember it if I were you. 
What seems to be going on here is that the speaker transposes herself into the world of the addressee. In this 
world the deictic centre is not the speaker but the addressee. The use of the personal pronouns in the Q-
clause is in keeping with this: I and my (which always refer to the deictic centre) refer to the addressee, not to 
the speaker (at least in the Q-clause). Conditionals like (167a-b) could therefore be said to show ‘projected 
deixis’ in the Q-clause. 
This explanation may, however, be too simple. There are Q-clauses in which we find a mixture of 
‘projected deixis’ and speaker’s deixis. Consider: 
(168) 
 
a. 
If I were you, I’d kill myself. 
 
 
b. 
If I were you, I’d kill me. 
Sentence (168a) is similar to (167a-b). It says ‘What I would do in your place is kill myself’ and can be used 
to convey the message ‘I advise you to kill yourself.’ By contrast, (168b) is interpreted as ‘What I would do 
in your place is kill me.’ Here the message is not about what the hearer should do to himself but about what 
the hearer should do to the speaker. That is, unlike myself in (168a), which is understood as referring to the 
hearer, me in (168b) refers to the speaker (although the subject I of the same clause does not). In some cases 
one and the same sentence allows two interpretations similar to those of (168a-b). In that case the nuclear 
accent in the P-clause determines the reading—see also Fillmore (1986: 181): 
(169) 
 
a. 
If I were your boss, I would punish you.  (The nuclear accent of the P-clause is on ‘I’; 
the reading is: ‘Your boss apparently accepts your behaviour but I wouldn’t: in his place I 
would punish you.’) 
 
 
b. 
If I were your BOSS, I would punish you.  (=I’m willing to leave your behaviour unpunished, 
but your boss wouldn’t.) 
Things become even more complicated when we consider examples like the following: 
(170) 
 
a. 
If Bill had been Kim, he wouldn’t have worn that pink dress to go to the ball. 
 
 
b. 
If Bill had been Kim, he wouldn’t have worn {her / *his} pink dress to go to the ball. 
These seem to be analogous to (167a-b). However, there cannot be ‘projected deixis’ from the speaker to the 
hearer here, because these are no longer the persons referred to in the counteridentical P-clause. The referents 
are now Bill and Kim, who are referred to from the point of view of the speaker. We cannot say either that 
there is a transposition from Bill’s world into Kim’s, because in that case we would expect she, not he, as 
subject of the Q-clause. Actually, it is he that has to be used, but, on the assumption that the dress is Kim’s, he 
has to combine with her dress, not his dress. All this seems extremely puzzling. 
As far as we can see, the solution to the puzzle is to give up analysing the subject I in the Q-clauses of 
(167)-(169) as determined by ‘projected deixis’ (i.e. by a shift to the hearer’s deictic centre). Instead, we can 
say that all the relevant deictics in (167)-(170) show speaker’s deixis. This seems especially clear from the 
use of he (=Bill) and her (=Kim’s) in (170b). In other words, what is special in (167)-(170) is not the use of 
me in (168b) or the use of her in (170b), nor the use of he as subject of the Q-clauses of (170a-b), but the use 
of I in the Q-clauses of (167)-(168) and of myself in (168b). The latter use should be interpreted as evincing 
speaker’s deixis, but in a special sense: in this case the speaker is not ‘I in the actual world’ (i.e. ‘I in my true 
identity’) but ‘I in the counterfactual world in which I am you’ (i.e. ‘I assuming the identity of the hearer’). 
As is clear from (168b), both I’s can be referred to in the same Q-clause: in I would kill me, I is the ‘I 
pretending to be you’ while me is the ‘I in my true identity’. (The fact that the two I’s do not have the same 
referent explains why the object of kill is not the reflexive pronoun myself but me. An object pronoun is 
automatically reflexive when it is coreferential with the subject of the same clause.) 
The fact that in I would kill me the two I’s are referred to in the same Q-clause does not present a problem 
because the deictic centre remains the speaker’s throughout. And this is quite in keeping with what we 
generally observe in counterfactual-P conditionals: they are like any other type of conditional in that they 
show speaker’s deixis (e.g. If I had done that I would be in jail now). In sum, the use of all the deictic 
pronouns in (167)-(170) is naturally accounted for if we assume that there is speaker’s deixis throughout, but 
that there is a special type of speaker’s deixis if the P-clause counterfactually identifies the speaker with the 
hearer (or someone else). 

It is in keeping with this analysis of counteridentical-P conditionals that, in spite of the assumed identity, 
the referent of the subject of the Q-clause in such conditionals must always be the referent of the subject of the 
P-clause, not the referent of the subject complement—see also Goodman (1991): 
(171) 
 
a. 
If I were you, {I / *you} wouldn’t do it. 
 
 
b. 
If you were me, {you / *I} wouldn’t do it. 
 
4.2.8. Interrogative Q-clauses in possible-world conditionals 
 
Though the various possible-world types of conditionals have been illustrated with examples with an 
assertoric Q-clause, it should be noted that there are similar examples in which the Q-clause is a 
nonassertoric truth question (=yes/no question). Although such truth questions do not have a truth value 
themselves, the very fact that the speaker asks the question makes clear that she is concerned with the truth 
of the corresponding proposition. Like assertoric Q-clauses, Q-clauses that are nonassertoric yes/no questions 
can therefore be concerned with the truth of a proposition in any of the possible-world types. Compare: 
(172) 
 
a. 
If you go to school on foot, why should you need money for the bus?  (factual-P; Q-
clause interpreted as a rhetorical question, i.e. as assertoric) 
 
 
b. 
If you go to school on foot, how much time does it take it?  (factual-P; nonassertoric Q-
clause) 
 
 
c. 
If (as you say) he’s coming, will he be alone?  (closed-P; nonassertoric Q-clause) 
 
 
d. 
If he comes, will he be alone?  (open-P; nonassertoric Q-clause) 
 
 
e. 
If she came, would you be happy?  (tentative-P; the Q-clause may be interpreted as an ‘open 
question’ [=nonassertoric] or as a rhetorical question [=assertoric].) 
 
 
f. 
If she had come, would you have been happy?  (counterfactual-P; the Q-clause may be 
interpreted as an ‘open question’ [=nonassertoric] or as a rhetorical question [=assertoric]. 
However, the fact that nonassertoric yes/no questions are concerned with truth does not alter the fact that 
they have no truth value, hence that the conditional in which they occur as Q-clause cannot be an inferential. 
The same is a fortiore true of nonassertoric wh-questions, which are not concerned with truth at all. Thus, in 
the following example, the P-clause is not premise-expressing: 
(173) 
 
If Oswald didn’t kill Kennedy, who did? 
In section 8.4 we will explain that such sentences are ‘rhetorical’ conditionals of a subtype which we will call 
‘nonassertoric-Q utterance conditionals’. In such conditionals the P-clause gives the reason why the speaker 
utters the nonassertoric Q-clause. (See also section 10.1.5.) 
 
4.2.9. The possible world(s) of P and Q 
 
In most conditionals, Q and P are interpreted in terms of the same possible world. However, there are 
exceptions to this, as the following examples illustrate: 
(174) 
 
a. 
If (as you tell me and I assume) she is ill, will John be informed about it?  (The P-
proposition is closed, the Q-proposition is an open question.) 
 
 
b. 
[“John’s lost his job again.”] — “If that’s true (and I believe it is), he would perhaps be 
interested in doing a job for me?  (closed P + tentative Q) 
Another illustration is that, when P is counterfactual, Q may be counterfactual too, but in some cases it may 
be ‘imaginary’, which is a combination of irrealis and neutral—see sections 3.11 and 4.2.2.7. An imaginary 
Q-clause does not imply anything about the truth of Q in the actual world. Its proposition forms part of a pure 
speculation or thought experiment. A counterfactual Q-clause, by contrast, is by definition interpreted as 
contrary to fact, i.e. as false in the actual world. In (175)-(176) below, the Q-clauses of the (a) sentences are 
counterfactual whereas those of the (b) sentences are imaginary. 
As we will see in section 8.3.2, when the P-clause of an irrealis conditional is interpreted as 
counterfactual, the unmarked situation is for the Q-clause also to be interpreted as counterfactual. However, 
it is quite possible for this counterfactual Q-implicature to be blocked or cancelled by the semantic-pragmatic 
meaning of a constituent of the Q-clause and/or by the linguistic or extralinguistic context. In that case the Q-

clause accompanying the counterfactual P-clause is interpreted as true in an imaginary world. As an 
illustration of this—others are to be found in section 8.3.2—compare the sentences in the following pairs of 
examples: 
(175) 
 
a. 
If we had taken the other road, we would have been here in time.  (Like P, Q is 
interpreted as counterfactual: the implied proposition #Q [=not [+q]: we were not here in 
time] is taken to be true in the actual world.) 
 
 
b. 
[“We are in time because we have taken the road I said we should take.”] — “If we had taken 
the other road, we would also have been here in time.”  (The counterfactual interpretation 
which Q receives in [175a] is blocked here by the preceding context and the use of ‘also’. As a 
result, Q is interpreted as true in an imaginary world. Because of ‘also’, which equates this 
imaginary world with the actual one, the imaginary Q-proposition ‘we would have been here 
in time’ is ultimately interpreted as implying the actual-world proposition ‘We were here in 
time.’) 
(176) 
 
a. 
If you hadn’t attended the meeting, you would have been in the dark about their plans.  
(Q is interpreted as counterfactual; this means that #Q, which is ‘not [+q]’, i.e. the hearer is 
not in the dark about their plans, is true in the actual world.) 
 
 
b. 
[“I only got to know about their plans because I attended the meeting.”] — “If you hadn’t 
attended the meeting, you would still have known about their plans [because Bill would have 
told you.]”  (The counterfactual interpretation of Q is blocked by the addition of ‘still’ and the 
‘because’-clause. This results in an imaginary reading of Q. Because of ‘still’, this reading 
implies the truth of ‘you know / knew about their plans’ in the actual world.) 
In sum, in an irrealis conditional with a counterfactual P, Q tends to be interpreted as counterfactual too, but 
this understanding is actually due to a pragmatic implicature (the nature of which will be explained in section 
8.3.2). There are cases in which Q is not interpreted as counterfactual because this implicated understanding 
is blocked. 
To close off this section, we would like to forestall a possible misunderstanding. There are conditionals 
which would seem to be as hybrid as (174a-b) but which differ from the latter in that the nature of the link 
between the P-clause and the Q-clause is difficult to describe: the following would not seem to be 
conditionals of any of the functional types (actualization conditionals, inferentials, etc.) that we have 
identified so far. 
(177) 
 
a. 
There is a remedy for this terrible disease, if only people had the nous to go to the doctor 
before it is too late.  (factual Q-clause + counterfactual overt P-clause) 
 
 
b. 
[The cat is still being a pain. I think it shows great self-control on my part that she hasn’t been 
murdered yet. Unfortunately, it’s been quite cold lately so,] even if I were tempted to think 
that she really is old enough to go outside, it’s too cold to risk it.  (COB-W) (tentative P-
clause + factual overt Q-clause) 
 
 
c. 
Surely if they had been zealous to pluck a brand from the burning, here was a noble 
opportunity.  (counterfactual P-proposition + factual Q-proposition) (This example is 
mentioned in Poutsma [1926: 173], with the remark: “The apodosis may express an actual 
fact and, accordingly, have its predicate in the indicative, although the protasis expresses a 
case which the speaker knows to be contrary to fact.”) 
However, the problem of analysing these sentences disappears once it is seen that these are ‘pseudo-Q 
conditionals’ (see section 3.12), i.e. that the ‘if P, Q’ relation is not between the P-clause and the overt Q-
clause, but between the P-clause and a covert Q-clause: 
(178) 
 
a. 
[There is a remedy for this terrible disease,] which would help people if only they had the 
nous to go to the doctor before it is too late.  (counterfactual covert Q + counterfactual P) 
 
 
b. 
[The cat is still being a pain. I think it shows great self-control on my part that she hasn’t been 
murdered yet. Unfortunately, it’s been quite cold lately so,] even if I were tempted to think 
that she really is old enough to go outside, I wouldn’t let her go outside [because it’s too cold 
to risk it].  (counterfactual P + counterfactual covert Q) 
 
 
c. 
Surely if they had been zealous to pluck a brand from the burning they {could / would / 
should} have done so, for here was a noble opportunity.  (id.) 

 
4.2.10. Modalization 
 
Closed-P conditionals differ from other nonneutral theoretical P-conditionals as far as modalization of P is 
concerned. The fact (observed in section 4.2.4 above) that in a closed conditional both P and Q may be 
epistemically modalized (i.e. p and q may both be presented as true, probable, possible, tentative or false) 
leads to the conclusion that a closed-P inferential conditional in which Q is an assertion may be paraphrased 
as follows: 
(179) 
 
Assuming that it is true that p is {true / probable / possible / unlikely / false}, I conclude that it 
is true that q is {true / probable / possible / unlikely / false}. 
For example, 
(180) 
 
If Oswald didn’t shoot Kennedy, someone else must have done. 
can be paraphrased as 
(181) 
 
Assuming that p (=the tensed proposition ‘Oswald shot Kennedy’) is false, I conclude that q 
(=the tensed proposition ‘Someone else shot Kennedy’) must be true. 
Needless to say, such conditionals contain so many epistemic modal elements (assuming ... false ... conclude 
... must ... true) that they are inferential conditionals par excellence. (This is not to say, however, that all 
closed-P conditionals are inferentials. As explained in section 4.2.4.4, there are two noninferential types of 
conditionals that have or may have a closed P-clause, viz. ‘premodified reduced it-clefts’ like If [as you say 
and I am willing to accept] someone should leave, it’s John and ‘nonassertoric-Q utterance conditionals’ like 
If [as appears to be the case] Jim is the boss, go and see him.) 
Of all the nonneutral theoretical-P conditionals, closed-P conditionals are the only ones that allow the use 
of an epistemic modal auxiliary or adverb in the (echoic) P-clause. In the other types, the only modalizer that 
can appear in the P-clause is not (or another negator), so that the only possible modal values are ‘positive’ 
and ‘negative’. (We agree with James’s [1986: 455] claim that not is a “modal qualifier”.) Thus, the 
following can be read as closed-P conditionals but not as open-P ones, in other words, the P-clause is 
necessarily echoic: 
(182) 
 
a. 
If Oswald cannot have shot Kennedy, someone else must have done. 
 
 
b. 
If you might buy a house in New York, you’d better consult Wendy. 
 
 
c. 
If John must have been lying, so must the ones who corroborated his story. 
Even if epistemic modalizers can only be found in theoretical P-clauses that are closed, they can occur freely 
in the Q-clause of any type of theoretical conditional: 
(183) 
 
a. 
If she reads this, she may object strongly. 
 
 
b. 
[If Chief Inspector Morse had been present at the short service, he would have been impatient 
with what he saw as the pretentious prayers; and yet,] almost certainly, he would have 
welcomed the hymn that was played there—’O Love that wilt not let me go’—and his quiet 
unmusical baritone would probably have mingled with the singing.  (DOC) 
 
4.2.11. The negation effected by counterfactuality 
 
The falsehood of p can be signalled not only by a wide scope negator in the P-clause (i.e. a negator affecting 
the P-clause as a whole rather than just a constituent of it), but also by the use of a counterfactual P-clause. 
Since a counterfactual world is understood as being contrary to the actual world, the counterfactual 
interpretation of a clause has the effect of negation with widest scope over that clause: 
(184) 
 
a. 
If he had come, he would have met Jill. 
 
 
b. 
If he had come, he wouldn’t have missed meeting Jill. 
 
 
c. 
If he hadn’t come, he would have missed meeting Jill. 
 
 
d. 
If he hadn’t come, he wouldn’t have met Jill. 
These examples show that, when we interpret a counterfactual proposition in terms of the real world, 
counterfactuality functions like external negation which has scope over the entire polarized (negative or 

positive) proposition—see also Reinhart (1976: 704). This does not mean that counterfactuality has scope 
over the whole conditional—this would give the wrong results, as it would mean that counterfactual ‘P hence 
Q’ just negated the ‘hence’ connection between the clauses. Actually, counterfactuality has scope over each 
clause separately: ‘counterfactual P, hence counterfactual Q.’ (In section 8.3.2 it will be shown that it is 
actually only by implicature that Q is interpreted as counterfactual when P is. However, this implicature is a 
strong one, which is blocked or cancelled only in explicit contexts. Since the examples dealt with here are 
not couched in such a context, we will disregard the fact it is only by implicature that ‘counterfactual P, 
hence counterfactual Q’ is true.) In (184a), ‘P, hence Q’ means that [+p] and [+q] are true in a counterfactual 
theoretical world, hence that ‘#[+p]’ and ‘#[+q]’ (where the symbol # represents the negation effected by 
counterfactuality) are true in the real world (which is contrary to the counterfactual world). In other words, 
the real world interpretation of (184a) includes the understandings ‘He didn’t come’ and ‘He didn’t meet 
Jill’. Similarly, in (184b), ‘P, hence Q’ is equivalent to ‘[+p] and [-q] are true in the counterfactual theoretical 
world, therefore “#[+p]” and “#[-q]” are true in the real world.’ Since counterfactuality is the negation that 
has widest scope over the constituent clauses, this is equivalent to saying that (184b) is interpreted as 
meaning that [-p] and [+q] are true in the real world: ‘He didn’t come, therefore he missed meeting Jill.’ (The 
negation leading to the interpretation that P is [-p] is always external negation [rather than constituent 
negation], because [-p] is equivalent to ‘not [+p]’. Counterfactuality is also external negation, but with wider 
scope than the negator in the P-clause. If there are two external negations, the one with wider scope cancels 
the other—see Reinhart 1976: 704. This explains why If he hadn’t come..., which is ‘#[-p]’ is interpreted as 
He has come, i.e. as [+p].) In the same way, the real world interpretation of (184c) includes the 
understandings ‘#[-p]’ and ‘#[+q]’ (=‘He came, therefore he didn’t miss meeting Jill’), while (184d) implies 
‘#[-p]’ and ‘#[-q]’ (=‘He came, therefore he met Jill’). 
The fact that the counterfactual [-p]-clauses of (184c)-(184d) have the positive understanding ‘He came’ 
(=#[-p]) may help to explain the superficially puzzling fact that assertive items (positive polarity items) can 
occur in such P-clauses: 
(185) 
 
If someone hadn’t already taken the money, I would’ve done it myself.  (The corresponding 
nonassertive items are ‘anyone’ and ‘yet’.) 
Our analysis of counterfactual clauses in terms of widest scope negation over the clauses in question is also 
in keeping with the distinction we have made between two kinds of irrealis conditionals. Compare: 
(186) 
 
a. 
They wouldn’t have denied doing it if they had been guilty.  (counterfactual-P; this is 
interpreted as ‘It’s not true that they were guilty.’) 
 
 
b. 
In their place, I wouldn’t have denied doing it if I’d been guilty.  (imaginary-P; this is 
interpreted neither as ‘It’s not true that I was guilty’ nor as ‘It’s true that I was guilty’.) 
 
4.3. Summary 
 
In this chapter we have argued that the distinction between factual-P and theoretical-P conditionals is based 
on the kind of possible world referred to by the P-clause. This typology can therefore be referred to as the 
‘possible-world typology’. In this typology, P-propositions are either factual or theoretical. The theoretical-P 
conditionals are subclassified into ‘neutral-theoretical-P’ and ‘nonneutral-theoretical-P’ conditionals. In the 
former, the P-proposition represents a mere supposition, while in the latter the supposition is accompanied by 
a presupposition (assumption) concerning the relation between the theoretical P-world and the actual world. 
The assumed relation may be that of identity (=closed condition), possible identity (=open condition), likely 
nonidentity (=tentative condition) or definite nonidentity (=counterfactual condition). As noted at the 
beginning of this chapter, this typology can summarized as in Table 1. 
 
Table 1: the possible-world typology of conditionals 
 
Possible P-world: 
 
 
- factual 
 
 
- theoretical (nonfactual) 
 
 
 
- neutral theoretical 
 
 
 
- nonneutral theoretical 
 
 
 
 
- closed 

 
 
 
 
- open 
 
 
 
 
- tentative 
 
 
 
 
- counterfactual 
 
In concluding this chapter, we may note that in our discussion of the various possible-world types (and their 
subclasses), we have often had reason to pay attention to the relation between these types and some functional types of 
conditionals. That is, although some possible-world types may turn up in many functional types of conditional, and 
often a given functional type may combine with several of the possible-world types, ‘possible-world type’ and 
‘functional type’ are not independent parameters in the characterization of conditionals. For example, it has been 
shown that factual-P conditionals can never be inferentials, that the subtype of rhetorical conditionals which we 
call ‘anchoring conditionals’ are typically neutral-P, that apparently closed P-clauses are only ostensibly closed in 
indirect inferentials, that open-P conditionals whose P-clause refers to the past are always inferential in function, that 
certain functions of tentative-P conditionals are functions that only really exist in tentative form, without there being a 
corresponding less tentative function that would justify the use of an open-P conditional, that ‘counteridenticals’ (e.g. 
If I were you...) form a subtype of counterfactual conditionals with a special use of pronouns in the Q-clause 
(I would kill myself versus I would kill me), etc. 

Chapter 5 
 
The use of tenses in possible-world conditionals 
 
 
A discussion of the use of tenses is indispensable in a work on English conditionals, because it is in large 
measure the choice of tense forms that determines the possible-world type of conditional—see also Funk 
(1985: 373). The following examples should be sufficient to illustrate this point: 
(187) 
a. 
If John is here tomorrow, we will be able to speak to him personally.  (open-P) 
 
 
b. 
If John will be here tomorrow, there is no need to telephone him today.  (closed-P) 
 
 
c. 
(context: the speaker is looking at John’s diary and lamenting the fact that he’s scheduled to be 
elsewhere tomorrow)  If John had been here tomorrow, we would have been able to speak to him 
personally.  (counterfactual-P) 
In chapter 4 we saw that the P-world referred to by the P-clause of a conditional may be factual, neutral-
theoretical or nonneutral-theoretical. Nonneutral-theoretical P-worlds can be closed, open, tentative or 
counterfactual. Q-clauses too may refer to the factual world or to a theoretical one. In most cases, P and Q 
are interpreted as pertaining to the same possible world, but there are exceptions to this. All this, and the fact 
that a possible world may be located in time in various ways (i.e. may be represented as present, past, pre-
present or future with respect to the time of utterance or another time of reference), entails that there are a 
multitude of possible tense forms in the P-clause and the Q-clause. 
 
5.1. The tense model 
 
The use of these tense forms are best analysed within the framework of a general theory of tense. The 
framework that we will make use of is that proposed in Declerck (1991a) and further elaborated and refined 
in Declerck (1995a, 1996, 1997, 1999b) and Declerck & Depraetere (1995). In our opinion, this is the only 
framework that accommodates all the empirical data that will be discussed in this chapter. We will begin by 
sketching the general outlines of this theory, limiting ourselves to those principles that will prove to be 
directly relevant to the subject under investigation. 
A preliminary note is that we use ‘present tense’, ‘past tense’, etc. as formal categories. Unlike Werth 
(1997a: 243), we do not say that go up is only “apparently” a present tense in If prices go up, I will sell my 
car, or that went up is an “apparent past” in If prices went up, I’d sell my car. As will be explained below, 
present and past tense forms do not necessarily refer to present and past time, respectively. 
 
5.1.1. Time-spheres and sectors 
 
The framework hinges on the claim that the use of a tense form in English implies that the speaker views the 
situation referred to as either past or nonpast with respect to the time functioning as ‘temporal zero-point’ 
(which is usually the moment of speech).15 That is, any tense form locates its situation either in the ‘past 
time-sphere’ or in the ‘present time-sphere’. These time-spheres are not objective physical entities but 
represent the ways in which an English language user conceptualizes time. The past time-sphere is conceived 
of as a timespan of indefinite length which lies wholly before (and hence does not include) the temporal 
zero-point (t0). To locate a situation in this time-sphere the speaker uses the preterite (past tense). The 
present time-sphere is conceived of as a timespan of indefinite length which includes t0 and is divided by it 
into three ‘sectors’: the portion of the present time-sphere that starts before t0 and reaches up to it is the ‘pre-
present sector’; the portion that is centred on t0 is the ‘present sector’; and the portion that follows t0 is the 
‘post-present sector’. This conceptualization of time can be represented as in Figure 1. In this diagram the 
time line is represented as consisting of two time-spheres. The dotted line in the middle of the time line is 
meant to represent the fact that there is felt to be a break between the two time-spheres. 
 
                                              
15 The temporal zero-point can also be the time of decoding (hearing / reading and interpreting) the message, as when a notice 
saying I’m in the library is stuck to the door of one’s office. 

xxxFigure 1: the English speaker’s conceptualization of the time line 
 
For ease of reference, we can use the term ‘absolute sectors’ to refer to the three present time-sphere sectors 
plus the past time-sphere. (These timespans are called ‘absolute’ because they are defined in direct relation to 
t0.) The four tenses that are used to locate the time of a situation in one of these four sectors can therefore be 
called ‘absolute tenses’. It is typical of absolute tenses that they relate the time of their situation directly to t0 
(by locating it in one of the absolute sectors) and not to the time of another situation or to another time of 
orientation (=reference time). 
The absolute tense used to locate the time of a situation in the past, pre-present, present or post-present 
are the past tense (preterite), the present perfect, the present tense and the future tense, respectively. 
Note that, unlike many others, we assume that there is a future tense in English. While acknowledging 
that there is an aspect of epistemic modality in the use of any verb form making a prediction, Declerck 
(1991a: 10-13) argues for the existence of a future tense. Declerck accepts Lyons’ (1977: 68) and Comrie’s 
(1985) definition of tense as ‘grammaticalization of location in time’. This means that there are as many 
tenses in English as there are formal means for a verb to locate a situation in time, irrespective of whether the 
formal means used is an inflectional morpheme (e.g. walked), a tense auxiliary (e.g. will walk), or a 
combination of the two (e.g. had walked). Since forms like will do are used to locate a situation in the post-
present (John will do it tomorrow), they are considered to be instances of the ‘future tense’. (See also the 
discussion of ‘pure future’, ‘prediction’ and ‘predictability’ in section 5.1.10.) 
 
5.1.2. ‘Full situation’ versus ‘predicated situation’ 
 
When referring to a situation we must distinguish between the ‘full situation’ and the ‘predicated situation’. 
The full situation is the complete situation as it actualizes in whatever possible world is being referred to; the 
predicated situation is that part of the full situation (possibly all of it) about which a claim is made in the 
sentence. As is clear from Two minutes ago John was in the library (which does not exclude that John is still 
there), it is the predicated situation rather than the full situation that is located in time by the use of the tense 
form. 
When the predicated situation is shorter than the full situation, the verb phrase must be one that represents 
the situation as homogeneous. A situation is represented as homogeneous if the verb phrase representing it 
can be used not only to refer to the full situation but also to refer to parts of that situation. Homogeneous 
situations are either atelic situations or telic situations referred to in the progressive form: 
(188) 
a. 
At 5 p.m. I {was at home / was walking home}. 
 
 
b. 
At that time I walked to work.  (=At that time I was in the habit of walking to work.) (A habit is a state: 
it denotes what is characteristic of the referent of the subject NP over an extended period of time.) 
When the actualization of a situation is represented as nonhomogeneous (bounded), the predicated situation 
is also the full situation: 
(189) 
I wrote two letters this morning. 
 
5.1.3. Time of the predicated situation 
 
The above distinction leads to a further distinction between the ‘time of the full situation’ and the ‘time of the 
predicated situation’ (i.e. the time at which the predicated situation is located, the time with which the 
predicated situation is simultaneous). It is the latter notion that counts when we speak of ‘time of the 
situation’ in connection with tenses. 
(190) 
[You can come tomorrow if you like.] I’ll be at home.  (It is possible that the speaker is at home at t0. 
However, the statement “I’ll be at home” does not say anything about t0: the predicated situation is located 
in the future.) 
It is important to see that by ‘time of the predicated situation’ and ‘time of the full situation’ we mean ‘time 
of the actualization of the predicated situation’ and ‘time of the actualization of the full situation’, 
respectively. This is especially relevant when the reference is to the future: 
(191) 
John {will / may / is going to / is to} be in Berlin tomorrow. 

Every one of these verb forms is a tense form which locates the time of the actualization of the predicated 
situation in the post-present. The fact that there is also a present aspect of meaning—there is a sense of 
present prediction, present possibility, present intention, present decision—is irrelevant to this. It only means 
that reference to the future has an aspect of present modality, but this is unrelated to the definition of ‘tense’, 
which is ‘the grammatical expression of the temporal location of the actualization of a (predicated) situation’ 
(see 5.1.1 above). 
The time of the predicated situation can only form a proper subpart of the time of the full situation if the 
predicated situation is representative of the full situation, i.e. if the full situation is conceived of as 
homogeneous. 
(192) 
a. 
John said he was ill.  (The time of saying is much shorter than the time of John’s being ill. The sentence 
is fine because ‘he was ill’ is homogeneous, which means that the time of the predicated situation, 
which is represented as simultaneous with the time of saying, is a proper subinterval of the time of the 
full situation.) 
 
 
b. 
John said that at that very moment he {was reading / *read} a book.  (The sentence is fine in the 
progressive because ‘he was reading a book’ is homogeneous. The sentence is ungrammatical with ‘he 
read a book’ because this clause is nonhomogeneous: in this case, the time of the predicated situation 
cannot coincide with the time of saying because it cannot be a proper subinterval of the time of the full 
situation [which is longer than the time of saying].) 
 
5.1.4. ‘Time of orientation’ (TO) and ‘time of the situation’ (STO) 
 
Any time functioning as the origin of a temporal relation expressed by a tense will be called a time of 
orientation (abbreviation: TO). There are three types of TO: 
(a) The first type of TO is the temporal zero-point: in sentences like I left yesterday, the time of orientation to 
which the time of the predicated situation is related (as anterior) is t0. Tenses that relate the time of a 
predicated situation directly to t0 are called absolute tenses. 
(b) A time of orientation may also be an ‘implicit TO’: in Bill had left, the time of the predicated situation is 
related as anterior to an implicit time of orientation which (in the prototypical use of the past perfect—see, 
however, 5.1.10 below) is understood as being anterior to t0. An implicit TO is neither t0 nor the time of a 
predicated situation. 
(c) A time of orientation may also be the time of a predicated situation: in John said that Bill had left, the 
past tense form said relates the time of its predicated situation as anterior to t0, whereas the past perfect form 
had left relates the time of its predicated situation as anterior to the time indicated by said. This shows that a 
time of orientation may be the time of a predicated situation. For ease of reference, we will call such a TO a 
‘situation-TO’ (abbreviation: STO). Since the time of a predicated situation can always serve as the origin of 
a temporal relation, any time of a predicated situation is at least a potential time of orientation. For this 
reason we will refer to the time of a predicated situation as a ‘situation-TO’ even if no other STO is related to 
it. 
(193) 
John stayed in the kitchen after he had finished his dinner.  (t0 functions as the TO to which the STO of John 
staying in the kitchen is represented as anterior, and the latter is the TO to which the STO of John finishing 
his dinner is represented as anterior.) 
 
5.1.5. Temporal domain 
 
When two STOs are located within the same sector, there are in principle two possibilities: either both of 
them are represented as temporally related to t0, or the time of one situation (not necessarily the first-
mentioned) is related to t0 while the second STO is related to the other STO. To capture these possibilities 
we need the notion of ‘temporal domain’. A (temporal) domain is a set of times of orientation which either 
consists of a single STO or comprises several STOs that are temporally related to each other by means of 
special tense forms. For example, the STOs of the four situations referred to in (194) are located within a 
single temporal domain: 
(194) 
John said that he had worked hard all day, that he was tired and that he would go to bed early. 
This domain can be represented as in Figure 2. (When representing a temporal domain by means of a 
diagram, we will observe the following conventions. The domain is represented by a Venn-diagram because 

it is a set of times [related to each other by the tense forms]. The central TO is the only TO which is placed 
on the time line, since it is the only TO that is directly related to t0. A vertical line is used to represent the 
relation of simultaneity, whereas a slanting line represents either anteriority or posteriority. An STO that is 
anterior to its binding TO is located to the left of the latter; an STO that is posterior to its binding TO is 
located to the right of the latter. All TOs and STOs are represented by a cross [or ‘x’], irrespective of whether 
they are durative or punctual.) 
 
xx Figure 2: the tense structure of John said that he had worked hard all day, that he was tired and that he 
would go to bed early. 
 
The first clause contains an absolute tense form (said) which locates its STO in the past sector and by doing 
so creates a past time-sphere domain (or ‘past domain’ for short). In general, the time of the situation which 
creates the domain is called the ‘central TO’ of the domain. The time of the situations of the situations 
referred to in the other clauses are ‘temporally subordinated’ to this, i.e. they are located in time by being 
related to this TO. In (194), the time of the situations of all the clauses except he said are temporally 
subordinated to the central TO (said). We can also say that they are temporally ‘bound’ by the latter. The 
central time of orientation is thus the ‘binding’ TO. When an STO (=the time of a situation) is bound by 
another (S)TO in a domain, the tense form used is a ‘relative’ tense form. For example, the past perfect form 
had worked in the second clause of (194) is a relative tense form representing its STO as anterior to the 
central TO. The preterite form was is also a relative tense form: unlike said, which establishes the domain 
(and is therefore an absolute tense form), was expresses a relation in the past domain, viz. the relation of 
simultaneity. And similarly, would go is a relative tense form, representing its STO (=the time at which the 
situation is located) as posterior to the central TO. 
It should be clear from (194) that the preterite can be used in two ways: either as an absolute tense 
(establishing a past domain by relating the time of the situation directly to t0) or as a relative tense 
(expressing the domain-internal relation of simultaneity). (For a fuller discussion of this claim, see Declerck 
[1995a].) The past perfect and the conditional tense, on the other hand, can only be used as relative tenses. 
 
5.1.6. ‘T-relations’ versus ‘W-relations’ 
 
It should be noted that an STO that is anterior to a time of orientation (in terms of real time) is not 
necessarily represented as anterior to that TO by the tense form used. Thus, a speaker has the choice between 
John left after I had arrived and John left after I arrived. In the former case she uses the relative tense form 
had arrived to express anteriority, in the latter she uses the absolute tense form arrived and leaves it to after 
to make the temporal relation between the two STOs clear. In order to avoid confusion when talking about 
temporal relations, it is therefore necessary to distinguish between relations expressed by tenses (= ‘T-
relations’) and relations that exist in the real world but are not expressed by tenses (= ‘W-relations’). 
 
5.1.6.1. T-relations 
 
A tense form can T-relate an STO to a TO in three different ways: 
(a) T-simultaneity: the time of the situation is represented as T-simultaneous with the time of orientation. It is 
in keeping with the distinction between ‘STO’ (=time of the predicated situation) and ‘time of the full 
situation’ that T-simultaneity is by definition a relation of strict coincidence. Thus, in [John said] he was 
feeling ill, the past tense form was feeling represents its STO as coinciding with the STO of said. The STO of 
was feeling is not the time of the full situation: it is the time of the predicated situation, i.e. that part of the 
time of the full situation that coincides with the STO of said. 
(b) T-anteriority: the time of the situation is represented as preceding the time of orientation in one of two 
ways. Either the STO lies completely before the TO (as in I have locked the door) or it begins before the TO 
and reaches up to it (as in We had been friends for years). 
(c) T-posteriority: the time of the situation is represented as following the time of orientation. In most cases 
the STO lies completely after the TO (as in I will do it tomorrow), but it is also possible for the STO to begin 
at the relevant TO and stretch into the future (as in From now on we will no longer support this 
organization). 
 

5.1.6.2. W-relations 
 
A situation may be simultaneous, anterior or posterior to another situation without this being expressed by a 
tense form. In that case the temporal relations are not tense relations (T-relations), but simply relations that 
exist in the real world (or in whatever world is being referred to). We refer to such temporal relations as 
world-relations (W-relations). 
(195) 
a. 
[“What were they doing?”] — “Betty was reading the paper, Bill was watching TV and Jeremy was 
sleeping on the sofa.”  (The three past tense forms are absolute tense forms which do no more than 
locate the three STOs in the past. It is clear, however, from the context that the three STOs must be 
interpreted as W-simultaneous with each other.) 
 
 
b. 
When they had first visited the house, they hadn’t noticed the wet patch on the ceiling of the kitchen.  
(The past perfect tense forms both relate their STO as T-anterior to an [unspecified] past TO. The 
relation of W-simultaneity that is understood to exist between the two situations is not expressed by the 
tense forms.) 
 
 
c. 
John told me he wrote Jim a letter.  (The past tense forms merely locate their STOs in the past. 
Pragmatic knowledge tells us that the writing must be understood as W-anterior to the telling.) 
Unlike simultaneity expressed by a tense form (=T-simultaneity), W-simultaneity is not a semantic relation 
but a pragmatic one. In other words, while T-simultaneity forms part of the semantics of certain tenses, W-
simultaneity is to be inferred from the context or from pragmatic knowledge. It follows (a) that W-
simultaneity is not a relation between STOs but between the times of full situations, (b) that W-simultaneity 
is a question of pragmatic interpretation rather than linguistic representation, and (c) that W-simultaneity is 
less rigidly defined than T-simultaneity: whereas the latter is equivalent to coincidence of STOs, W-
simultaneity can, according to context, be interpreted as coincidence, overlap or proper inclusion. In other 
words, the times of two full situations are W-simultaneous the moment they have one point of time in 
common. 
(196) 
a. 
I heard the shot that was fired at Andy.  (The two situations coincide with each other.) 
 
 
b. 
I met John as I was walking to work.  (The situation of walking properly includes the situation of 
meeting John.) 
 
 
c. 
While Michael was cleaning the house, I was working in the garden.  (The two situations may coincide 
or overlap: one situation may have started at, before or after the beginning of the other situation, and 
either of them may have ended at, before or after the end of the other situation.) 
 
5.1.7. Direct and indirect binding 
 
It should be noted that two STOs that are simultaneous (in terms of real time) are not necessarily represented 
as simultaneous by the tense form used. Since the speaker has a large measure of freedom in locating STOs 
in time, she may also make use of other possibilities that are available in the English tense system. In 
general, when the time of the situation of a subclause is temporally subordinated to another STO, the binding 
STO is usually the STO of its head clause (=the clause on which the subclause is syntactically and 
semantically dependent). This form of binding we call ‘direct binding’. However, some types of subclause 
also allow their STO to be temporally subordinated to the STO of a clause other than their head clause. In 
that case there is ‘indirect binding’. For instance, the relative clause is bound directly in (197a) and indirectly 
in (197b): 
(197) 
a. 
She expected he would do it on a day when she herself was absent. 
 
 
b. 
She expected he would do it on a day when she herself would be absent. 
In these examples, the time of the situation of the relative clause is interpreted as W-simultaneous with that 
of its head clause (i.e. the that-clause) and as W-posterior to that of the matrix (i.e. the highest clause in the 
syntactic tree structure). However, in neither example is it the case that both these temporal relations are 
actually expressed by the tense form in the relative clause. A tense form can relate an STO to only one time 
of orientation at a time, so only one of these two W-relations can be expressed by the tense form. In (197a), 
was represents its STO as T-simultaneous with the STO of its head clause, thus effecting direct binding. 
Although we interpret the relative clause-STO as being W-posterior to the time of the situation of the matrix 
clause, this relation is not expressed by the relative clause tense (was), but is inferred via the T-relation of the 
head clause-STO to the matrix-STO. That is, the tense forms tell us that the STO of would do is T-posterior 

to the STO of expected and that the STO of was is T-simultaneous with that of would do. In (197b), would be 
effects indirect binding: it represents its STO as T-posterior to the STO of the matrix (expected). Thus in 
(197b), although we still (normally) interpret the STO of the relative clause as W-simultaneous with the head 
clause-STO, that W-simultaneity relation is not expressed by the tense form. The tense structures of (197a-b) 
are therefore as represented by Figures 3 and 4, respectively. (The wavy line in Figure 4 represents the 
simultaneity relation not expressed by the tense form.) 
 
xxFigure 3: the tense structure of She expected he would do it on a day when she herself was absent. 
 
 
xxFigure 4: the tense structure of She expected he would do it on a day when she herself would be absent. 
 
 
The following examples show that indirect binding by means of the conditional tense is the rule in some 
types of subclause, but is ruled out in others: 
(198) 
a. 
Bill promised that he would ring me up the next day even though he {would be / *was} extremely busy 
that day. 
 
 
b. 
Bill promised that he would ring me up the next day if he {was not / *would not be} too busy. 
The following sentences illustrate the use of the past perfect for indirect binding. In all of them, the past tense 
(effecting direct binding) could be used instead:16 
(199) 
a. 
There had been a lad amongst Morse’s fellow pupils in the sixth form who had possessed a virtually 
photographic memory—[a memory which Morse had much admired].  (WTW) 
 
 
b. 
... whose youngest daughter, Sarah, had been killed by an articulated lorry as she had cycled down 
Cumnor Hill on her way to school...  (WTW) 
 
 
c. 
[He said that] John had waited outside while Mary had locked up.  (Huddleston 1969: 792) 
When an STO is directly bound, the binding time of orientation need not always be the central TO. The 
binding TO may also be another STO in the domain. For example, in (200) the working is represented as T-
simultaneous with the feeling tired, which is itself represented as T-anterior to the saying: 
(200) 
John said he had felt very tired when he was working. 
It should be noticed that in (194) and (200) the relative tense form used to express T-simultaneity is each 
time the preterite (past tense), irrespective of whether the binding time of orientation is or is not the central 
TO of the domain. We conclude from this that there is a single system of relative tenses to express T-
relations in a past domain: we always use the preterite for T-simultaneity, the past perfect for T-anteriority, 
and a form with would or were going to for T-posteriority, irrespective of whether the binding time of 
orientation is the central TO or a bound STO. 
 
5.1.8. Sloppy simultaneity 
 
When a tense form is used that expresses T-simultaneity, the latter relation need not always correspond with 
‘strict W-simultaneity’. It may also be ‘sloppy W-simultaneity’ (Declerck 1991a: 41-45). We speak of sloppy 
W-simultaneity when a tense form which is normally used for expressing T-simultaneity is used with 
reference to an STO which does not have a point of time in common with the binding TO. A clear illustration 
of such a use is provided by examples like the following, where the two STOs closely follow each other, but 
the relevant verb form is a nonfinite form whose basic temporal meaning is the expression of T-simultaneity, 
viz. a present participle: 
(201) 
a. 
Opening the drawer he took out a booklet. 
 
 
b. 
Raising the lid of the well she pointed to the green water. 
 
 
c. 
The lorry skidded off the road, narrowly missing a couple of cottages, [and ended up in a field]. 
                                              
16 There is a similar use of the perfect infinitive in infinitival clauses: 
 
(i) 
[He wondered if she had had her bath.] There had been quite enough time for her to have had it, [but would she go out 
into the cold immediately after having had it?]  (LOD) 

The fact that verb forms expressing T-simultaneity can be used in a sloppy way illustrates the fact that T-
simultaneity is the unmarked T-relation of the three that can be expressed by verb forms. This is especially 
clear in open-P conditionals referring to the post-present, where the expression of a temporal relation 
between the two clauses is less important than the expression of the logical link (‘if P, then Q’). In such 
conditionals, the P-clause is therefore likely to express T-anteriority only if it contains a relational adverbial 
like by 5 o’clock (as in I will go home if she has not arrived by 5 o’clock). Otherwise it normally involves a 
tense form expressing T-simultaneity. As we will see, T-simultaneity with the central time of orientation of a 
post-present domain is expressed by the present tense: I’ll be happy if she comes. The P-clause can use the 
present tense even when the two clauses contain adverbials referring to different times, as in If you don’t tell 
her today, I will tell her myself tomorrow. In such a sentence, where the Q-situation is clearly seen as 
actualizing only after the actualization of the P-situation, the speaker represents the two situations as if they 
were W-simultaneous if she is just thinking of them as two post-present situations that are logically 
connected with each other. It is only when she wants to draw explicit attention to the fact that one situation is 
over when the other takes place that she selects the verb form expressing T-anteriority (If you haven’t told 
her today, I will tell her myself tomorrow). (The fact that conditional sentences represent the contents of the 
two clauses as T-simultaneous is also apparent from the fact that the Q-clause can often be introduced by 
then. This use of then may not be purely temporal, but it is reminiscent of one of the temporal meanings of 
the adverb, viz. ‘at that time’, i.e. ‘at the time referred to in the if-clause’. See also Schiffrin [1992] and 
Dancygier & Sweetser [1997: 116].) 
 
5.1.9. Shift of temporal perspective 
 
Apart from the notion of domain, we also need the notion of ‘shift of temporal perspective’. What we mean 
by this is the phenomenon that when the speaker establishes or expands a domain, she sometimes treats the 
domain in question is as if it belonged to another absolute sector. A well-known example is the so-called 
historic present: a situation that lies in the past sector is treated as if it were a present situation. In that case 
there is a shift of temporal perspective from the past to the present. 
 
5.1.10. ‘Present Perspective System’ versus ‘Future Perspective System’ 
 
xx Figure 5: the shift of temporal perspective from the post-present to the present 
 
As shown in Figure 3, there is always a shift of temporal perspective from the post-present to the present 
when a speaker develops a post-present domain. Once a post-present domain has been established (by a 
future tense form) and we want to incorporate another STO into it, we treat the central TO of the post-present 
domain as if it were a present TO (i.e. as if it included t0 or coincided with t0). This means that in order to T-
relate an STO to this post-present time of orientation we use one of the same tenses as we use to T-relate an 
STO to t0. That is, the set of relative tenses used in a post-present domain coincides with the set of absolute 
tenses. This is clear from examples like the following: 
(202) 
a. 
[If we dump his body in Soho after we have killed him] the police will think that he was killed there.  
(see Figure 5) 
 
 
b. 
[He’s always got such clichéd excuses for being late for rehearsal.] Next Friday the story will probably 
be that he’s been rescuing an old lady’s cat from a tree. 
 
 
c. 
[When you arrive in Tokyo] you will find that it is already dark. 
 
 
d. 
[If I ever resign] you will be the first person to hear that I will do so. 
 
 
e. 
[There’s no pleasing that one. He’s complaining because the room’s too warm, but] if I open a window, 
he’ll complain because there’s a draught. 
 
 
f. 
[It is important that you reply to this letter before the end of the month.] Anybody who hasn’t replied to 
it by then will be fined. 
 
xx Figure 6: the tense structure of [If we dump his body in Soho after we have killed him] the police will 
think that he was killed there. 
 
In each of (202a-f) the head clause establishes a post-present domain and the STO of the subordinate clause 
is incorporated into it. Since the speaker treats the central time of orientation of the domain as if it were t0, 

she uses a ‘pseudo-absolute’ tense form in the subclause. That is, the tenses used to T-relate an STO to the 
central TO of a post-present domain are the preterite or present perfect for T-anteriority, the present tense for 
T-simultaneity and the future tense for T-posteriority. In Declerck (1991a, 1991b) and Declerck & 
Depraetere (1995), this system of tenses used to express a T-relation in a post-present domain is labelled the 
‘Present Perspective System’ (PPS). This label is meant to capture the fact that this system is based on a shift 
of perspective to the present: the post-present binding TO is treated as if it were t0. In other words, the 
perspective from which the situations are viewed is that of a ‘pseudo-present’ TO, i.e. a ‘pseudo-t0’. This 
explains why in the Present Perspective System it is the present tense that is used to express T-simultaneity. 
(The label ‘Present Perspective System’ is potentially confusing, though, because it might suggest that the 
perspective from which the situations are viewed is that of the ‘real’ present rather than that of the pseudo-
present. It is therefore important to remember the definition given here. A good mnemonic is the fact that the 
present tense is the most important tense in the Present Perspective System. Another possibility would be to 
treat ‘Present Perspective System’ as short for ‘Pseudo-present Perspective System’.) 
Next to the Present Perspective System there is also a ‘Future Perspective System’ (FPS). This system 
consists of tenses that establish a post-present domain. It comprises (a) the future tense in its absolute (rather 
than pseudo-absolute) use, (b) the present tense effecting a shift of temporal perspective from the post-
present to the present (I’m coming tomorrow), and (c) two ‘absolute-relative tenses’ which not only establish 
a post-present domain but also indicate a T-relation in it. Examples of absolute-relative tense forms are will 
have left and will be going to leave, in which will establishes the domain and have...-en or be going to 
represent the STO as T-anterior or T-posterior to the central TO of the domain. 
It should be noted that, in the same way as the Present Perspective System does not refer to a set of tenses 
which express the future seen from the perspective of the real present, the Future Perspective System does 
not refer to tenses which express the future seen from a future perspective. The reason for choosing the label 
‘Future Perspective System’ is that this system uses tense forms referring to the future, such as will do, will 
have done, will be going to do. (The terms ‘Future Perspective System’ and ‘Present Perspective System’ 
may be considered misnomers, but since they have been consistently used in Declerck’s various books and 
articles, we are not going to introduce other labels here. A mnemonic for remembering the definition of 
Future Perspective System is the presence of will [or be going to] in every one of its tense forms.) 
The above distinction between the Present Perspective System and the Future Perspective System is 
especially relevant to conditionals. We will argue that the present tense form in the P-clause of If the weather 
is fine tomorrow, we’ll have a picnic is a PPS-form, whereas the future tense form in the Q-clause is an FPS-
form. This analysis implies that we reject the hypothesis that the present tense in the subclause is the result of 
‘will-deletion’. The will-deletion hypothesis is accepted by, amongst others, Fodor (1968: 13), Kittredge 
(1969: 15), Ross (1970), Sampson (1971: 588), Vasudeva (1971: 167), Wekker (1977: 68, 1980: 99), 
although Ejerhed Braroe (1974) points out some problems for such an analysis. 
PPS-forms should be distinguished carefully from another use of the present tense with future time 
reference, viz. that illustrated by sentences like the following: 
(203) 
a. 
I’m leaving tomorrow. 
 
 
b. 
Next year Christmas falls on a Wednesday. 
This use of the present tense is also the result of a shift of perspective to the present: a post-present situation 
is treated as if it were a present one. However, this use is clearly different from the use of the present tense in 
the Present Perspective System. For one thing, the shift of perspective to the present which occurs in (203a-
b) has a semantic effect which is absent if the present tense is a PPS-form: in (203a-b) the post-present 
situation is represented as ‘pre-determined’, i.e. as depending on a present arrangement, programme, plan, 
etc. For another, this use of the present tense is mainly found in clauses that are syntactically independent, 
whereas the Present Perspective System cannot be used in that type of clause at all (see below). Moreover, 
this kind of present tense use can be found in head clauses supporting a subordinate clause using the Present 
Perspective System: 
(204) 
We’re having a picnic tomorrow, if it doesn’t rain. 
In this sentence, the present tense form with ‘arranged future’ meaning is an FPS-form: like any other 
absolute tense form creating a post-present domain (as in I’ll do it or I’m going to do it), it belongs to the 
Future Perspective System. By contrast, a PPS-form cannot establish a domain. The Present Perspective 

System consists of forms that are used to express a relation within a post-present domain already established 
by a superordinate clause. 
One of the basic distributional differences between the Future Perspective System and the Present 
Perspective System is that only the former can be used in syntactically independent clauses. Compare: 
(205) 
a. 
[Tom will need to be there to let us into the bank vaults, but don’t worry, he won’t cause us any trouble 
with the police when they talk to him.] He will say that he has not seen anything, has not heard 
anything, and that he does not know anything at all. 
 
 
b. 
[Tom will need to be there to let us into the bank vaults, but don’t worry, he won’t cause us any trouble 
with the police when they talk to him.] He will not have seen anything, he will not have heard anything, 
and he will not know anything at all. 
 
 
c. 
*[Tom will need to be there to let us into the bank vaults, but don’t worry, he won’t cause us any 
trouble with the police when they talk to him.] He has not seen anything, has not heard anything, and 
he does not know anything at all. 
In (205a) we have an instance of IRS (=indirect reported speech),17 with PPS-forms in the that-clauses. In 
(205b-c) the reporting clause he will say has been dropped, so that we have free indirect speech (FIS), i.e. the 
reported clauses are syntactically independent. Example (205b) shows that the result is impeccable if we use 
FPS-forms, whereas (205c) shows that the result is bad (since we get an incoherent piece of discourse) if we 
try using PPS-forms: the present perfect forms in (205c) are not interpreted as PPS-forms at all, but rather as 
absolute tense forms (representing their situations as anterior to t0). 
As regards the choice between the Present Perspective System and the Future Perspective System, 
subordinate clauses fall into three groups. In some of them (e.g. nonrestrictive relative clauses) the Future 
Perspective System is obligatory; others (e.g. adverbial time clauses) require the Present Perspective System, 
whereas still others (e.g. restrictive relative clauses) allow either system. For example: 
(206) 
a. 
The meeting will probably be declared open by John, who {will also introduce / *also introduces} the 
main speaker. 
 
 
b. 
The meeting will no doubt come to an end before the pub {closes / *will close}. 
 
 
c. 
At the airport you will be met by a man who {is wearing / will be wearing} a red jacket. 
Up to now we have introduced some of the basic concepts of Declerck’s (1991a) model of tense. We will 
now have a closer look at the distinction between Future Perspective System and Present Perspective System. 
Let us begin by looking briefly at the internal semantic structure of tenses. According to Declerck 
(1991a), the basic function of a tense is to express a temporal structure which has the form of a chain of 
relations. This chain, which may consist of two or more links, relates the STO (=time of the situation) to a 
‘basic TO’, either directly or via one or more intermediate TOs. (The time of the situation is treated as a time 
of orientation because the time of another situation can be related to it.) The basic time of orientation 
(represented as ‘TO1’) is that TO in the structure of the tense from which the temporal relations expressed by 
the tense begin to be computed. In most cases TO1 is t0, but there are cases in which it is a post-present 
binding TO. Compare: 
(207) 
a. 
He has done it. 
 
 
b. 
[If he does it] he will have to admit to his wife that he has done it. 
In both (207a) and (207b) the present perfect form has done locates the STO before the basic TO. In (207a) 
this TO1 is t0; in (207b) it is a post-present STO (the time of admitting) which is treated as if it were t0. This 
means that the two present perfect forms realize the same temporal structure (viz. ‘STO T-anterior to, and 
lying in a period leading up to, TO1’), but that the TO1 is t0 in (207a) and a post-present ‘pseudo-t0’ in 
(207b). (Note that in [207b] the TO1 is interpreted as W-posterior to t0, but that this W-relation is not 
signalled by the tense form has done itself: it is inferred from the use of the future tense in the head clause 
and the pragmatics of the context.) 
The following sentences involving a future tense form are similar to (207a-b): 
(208) 
a. 
You will meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger in the next week. 
 
 
b. 
[If you go to that fortune teller] she will tell you that you will meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger in the 
next week. 
                                              
17 In the literature, IRS is often simply referred to as either “indirect speech” or “reported speech”. However, like Salkie & Reed 
(1997) we will make a distinction between “direct reported speech” (DRS) (e.g. John said: ‘I am ill’) and “indirect reported 
speech” (IRS) (e.g. John said that he was ill). 

Needless to say, will meet is used as an FPS-form in (208a) and as a PPS-form in (208b). The essential 
difference between the two systems is therefore the different nature of the basic time of orientation: in the 
Future Perspective System it is t0, in the Present Perspective System it is a post-present TO1 referred to in the 
context. (Since the post-present TO1 is treated as if it were t0, the set of tense forms used in the Present 
Perspective System is exactly the same as the set of absolute tense forms. There is no formal difference 
between them. In spite of this, we will speak of ‘PPS-forms’ and ‘FPS-forms’. These are to be understood, 
respectively, as ‘forms belonging to the Present Perspective System’ and ‘forms belonging to the Future 
Perspective System’.) 
Let us proceed now from the discussion of tense structure to a discussion of the use of the Present 
Perspective System and the Future Perspective System in subclauses (=subordinate clauses). One 
consequence of the different nature of the TO1 is that an FPS-form is an absolute tense form, which creates a 
domain in the post-present sector, whereas a PPS-form is a relative tense form, which is used to locate an 
STO in an already established post-present domain. 
It follows that the temporal specification effected by an FPS-form is context-independent, whereas that 
effected by a PPS-form is not. (This accords with Allen [1966: 179], who applies the terms “free verb 
clusters” and “bound verb clusters” to what we call FPS-forms and PPS-forms.) A PPS-form requires a 
context providing a post-present time of orientation serving as TO1 for the PPS-form. This means that the 
interpretation of a PPS-form happens partly on the basis of the temporal structure expressed by the tense 
form itself and partly on the basis of the context. More specifically, the understanding that the PPS-form 
refers to the post-present is derived from the context. (In most cases, it is the STO of the head clause that 
functions as TO1 for the PPS-form. In cases like When the police come, you didn’t see anything, OK?, there 
is a ‘covert’—see section 11.7.2—head clause like ‘tell them’ or ‘you should say’.) Since the identification 
of the post-present TO1 is essential to the interpretation of a PPS-form, forms that could in principle be PPS-
forms cannot be interpreted as such when they occur out of context. 
This observation explains why the Present Perspective System cannot be used in syntactically 
independent clauses, as is clear from (205a-c) above. Independent clauses do not have a superordinate clause 
referring to a marked deictic centre determining their tenses. It follows that the tense of an independent 
clause is automatically interpreted in relation to the unmarked deictic centre, viz. t0. 
For a subclause to use the Present Perspective System, it is necessary that the head clause establish a post-
present domain, but it should be noted that this need not be done in an explicit way, i.e. by the use of an FPS-
form. A post-present domain can also be established implicitly by the use of an imperative, infinitive or 
another form implying post-present actualization: 
(209) 
a. 
Do it when the others {have / *will have} left. 
 
 
b. 
I hope to do it when the others {have / *will have} left. 
In some cases the idea of post-present actualization follows from the lexical meaning of the verb of the head 
clause or matrix: 
(210) 
[Just now I asked him when he wanted to discuss our plans.] He suggested discussing them when the others 
{have left / *will have left}. 
So, what is necessary for the use of a PPS-form is that there is a post-present time available to function as 
TO1. This time is normally an STO (=the time of a situation), but it need not be indicated by a tensed form. 
In a complex sentence with an FPS-form in the head clause, a subclause may (under certain conditions) 
use either the Future Perspective System or the Present Perspective System. When it uses the Future 
Perspective System (as in At 6.30 I will join the people who will be waiting for me), the W-relation between 
the STO of the HC (i.e. the time of the situation of the head clause) and the STO of the subclause is not 
expressed by the tense forms: independently of one another, each of the two FPS-forms relates its STO to t0 
and in doing so establishes a post-present domain. (These two domains may be pragmatically interpreted as 
overlapping or coinciding with each other, but this relation is not expressed by the tense forms.) By contrast, 
if the subclause uses the Present Perspective System (as in I will ask him tomorrow what date it is), the tense 
form of the subclause locates the STO of the subclause in the temporal domain created by the head clause 
and in so doing relates it to the STO of the head clause. 
It follows that when the Future Perspective System is used in both clauses, the speaker makes two 
independent predictions: there are, as it were, two illocutionary speech acts. When the Present Perspective 
System is used in the subclause, the speaker makes a single (but complex) prediction: she presents the 

contents of the two clauses as forming a unit. The use of the Present Perspective System, which implies that 
the STO of the head clause and the STO of the subclause are located in the same domain, is therefore a sign 
that the two situations must be interpreted as related to each other. This relation may be purely temporal, but 
in most cases it is also a logical one: if there is no logical relation between two situations, there is as a rule no 
reason to relate them temporally to each other. As a matter of fact, the use of PPS-forms in the P-clauses of 
conditionals is conventionalized as a means of expressing a logical relationship rather than a purely temporal 
one: the logical relation is expressed as if it were a temporal one. (Though the basic meaning of any tense is 
to express a T-relation, there are many uses of tense forms that are metaphorical extensions of this. For 
example, the preterite, whose basic meaning is ‘remoteness in time’ [i.e. location in the past time-sphere] is 
conventionally used to express other forms of remoteness, e.g. remoteness from reality [counterfactuality], as 
in I wish I knew the answer, or tentativeness, as in I wanted to ask you a favour.) 
Because using the Present Perspective System in a P-clause is a way of expressing the temporal and 
logical relation between P and Q, or between the P-situation and the Q-situation, it implies that the P-clause 
is necessary for a correct interpretation of the Q-clause.18 The fact that the Q-clause and the P-clause are 
presented as one interpretive unit means that it is not only the case that the P-clause is dependent for its 
temporal interpretation on the Q-clause (which is obvious, since the P-clause is temporally subordinated to 
the Q-clause), but that it is also the case that the Q-clause depends for (at least part of) its interpretation on 
the P-clause. It is no coincidence that the types of conditionals in which the Present Perspective System must 
be used in the P-clause show this close interpretive relationship between the two clauses. The most typical 
examples are open-P actualization conditionals: as a rule, these require the use of the Present Perspective 
System in the P-clause if the Q-clause uses the Future Perspective System. In this type of sentence the logical 
dependence of Q on P is obvious: the P-situation is a condition for the actualization of the Q-situation. 
It has often been noted in the linguistic literature that the types of subclause that do not allow the use of 
the future tense do not allow the use of epistemic modals such as may or must either: 
(211) 
a. 
*John will do it {when / if} he will have time. 
 
 
b. 
*John will do it {when / if} he may have time. 
 
 
c. 
*John will do it {when / if} he must have time. 
This observation is the main argument for the common claim that will too is a modal auxiliary and that there 
is no future tense in English—see e.g. Huddleston (1984: 173); Quirk et al. (1985: 213). However, the only 
conclusion that can be drawn from examples like (211a-c) is that the auxiliaries will, may and must have 
something in common which rules out their use in open-P conditionals and adverbial time clauses. In our 
opinion, the fact that will cannot be used is an indication that future time reference in these subclauses 
requires the use of the Present Perspective System. The fact that the Future Perspective System cannot be 
used is due to the fact that in sentences like (211a-c) the subclause-STO must be T-related to a post-present 
TO1 rather than to t0. (Why this should be the case is a question we will go into below—see also Declerck & 
Depraetere [1995].) Once this constraint is seen, the impossibility of using epistemic modals in these 
subclauses becomes predictable, since epistemic modals like may and must express an evaluation which is 
temporally located at t0. In the same way as He will come means ‘I [now] predict his [future] coming’, He 
may come means ‘I [now] assert the possibility of his [future] coming’. (In other words, may is equivalent to 
‘It is possible that...will...’.) What will and may (as well as must) have in common in such sentences is that 
they use t0 as basic TO (evaluation time). This property excludes them from clauses that are subject to the 
constraint that the time of the situation has to be temporally subordinated to a post-present TO1 rather than to 
t0. It should be noted, however, that unlike epistemic may and must, the tense auxiliary will need not always 
refer to the zero-time as deictic centre. That is, it can be used not only as an FPS-form (expressing T-
posteriority to t0) but also as an PPS-form expressing T-posteriority to the pseudo-t0 which is the central TO 
of the post-present domain. We have already illustrated this possibility with example (208b): 
(208) 
b. 
[If you go to that fortune teller] she will tell you that you will meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger in the 
next week. 
 
5.1.11. The future tense and modality 
                                              
18 In indirect inferentials, however, it is the other way round: the logical relationship premise-conclusion is between Q and P 
rather than vice versa. It is in keeping with this that, if the P-clause of an indirect inferential refers to the post-present, it uses an 
FPS-form: If it {is going to be / will be / *is} 35 degrees Centigrade here tomorrow, I’m a Dutchman! 

 
At this point it is necessary to turn to a theoretical issue which has already been mentioned in 5.1.7. Contrary 
to the widespread view that “the future is not a tense at all, but a mode” (Cygan 1972: 9), we believe that 
there is a future tense in English. In John will come tomorrow the form will come serves to locate an STO in 
time and therefore satisfies the definition of a tense form. (We subscribe to Lyons’ [1977: 68] definition of 
tense, which says that tense “grammaticalizes the relationship which holds between the time of the situation 
that is being described and the temporal zero-point of the deictic context”.) This is not to say that we do not 
recognize the fact that the future tense has modal connotations, since an utterance about a situation that has 
not yet held is of necessity “a subjectively modalized utterance: a prediction rather than a statement” (Lyons 
1977: 815). The point is that this element of epistemic modality does not alter the fact that, in the above 
example, the primary aspect of meaning of will, and the basic reason for its use, is that it locates its STO in 
the post-present sector. 
The element of epistemic modality in the meaning of the future tense becomes stronger according as there 
is a stronger implication of subjectivity, i.e. of speaker’s judgement. We can roughly distinguish between 
‘pure future’, ‘prediction’ and ‘predictability’. Pure future is the least subjectified: the speaker just locates an 
STO in the post-present without there being a clear implication that it is her own expectation that the 
situation is going to actualize (e.g. [They tell me] the flower show will be held on 21 July). Prediction and 
predictability involve a (respectively weaker and stronger) sense of expectation. The following sentence can 
help to make the distinction clear: 
(212) 
If there’s a knock at the door, it’ll be the milkman. 
This sentence can be interpreted in two ways: 
(213) 
a. 
It is possible that there will be a knock at the door. If so, I predict that it’ll be the milkman. 
 
 
b. 
You tell me there’s a knock at the door. If so, it is predictable that it is the milkman. 
On the former reading, the speaker of (212) uses the future tense to make a prediction about the post-present; 
on the interpretation (213b), she uses will to express the predictability of a conclusion concerning a present 
situation. The epistemic aspect of meaning is clearly strongest in the reading (213b). Prediction concerns an 
assumption about the actualization of a situation in the post-present (or, in the case of would, actualization at 
a time W-posterior to the time of making the prediction). Predictability is a more strongly epistemic notion in 
that it concerns the speaker’s assumption of the strong plausibility of a conclusion. This conclusion usually 
concerns the past or present, seldom the future. Whereas in sentences with a first person subject, will 
alternates with shall when the future tense expresses pure future or a prediction, there is as a rule no such 
alternation when will expresses predictability. 
The area where the distinction between pure future, prediction and predictability gets blurred is when the 
reference is to a specific post-present situation. In that case both prediction and predictability concern a 
statement that is based on a present expectation. Though one could say that the expectation in question is 
based on evidence in the case of predictability, whereas it need be no more than an assumption in the case of 
prediction, in practice it may be very difficult to distinguish between the two interpretations. For example: 
(214) 
If you don’t do your homework, you will fail the exam. 
There is certainly a case for treating will as a pure future form here, since we can use shall in the 
corresponding first person sentence: 
(215) 
If I don’t do my homework, I shall fail the exam. 
On the other hand, (214) can also be interpreted as ‘If you don’t do your homework, I assume that you will 
fail the exam’ or ‘If you don’t do your homework, it is predictable that you will fail the exam’. 
So, we agree with Werth (1997b: 111) that, in a sense, “the true future ... is epistemic”, and assume that 
will-forms with the weak or strong epistemic connotation of pure future, prediction or predictability can be 
treated as future tense forms. In doing so we follow Declerck (1991a: 87), who argues that the use of will for 
predictability—a use which is traditionally treated as modal rather than temporal—can in fact be analysed as 
the use of future tense will in order to put the ‘temporal focus’ (Declerck 1990, 1991a: 80-88) on a post-
present time of evaluation. The idea of ‘temporal focus’ is clear from the following examples: 

(216) 
a. 
I spoke to the foreigner in French because he didn’t understand English.  (The foreigner presumably 
still does not understand English, so the speaker could have used ‘doesn’t understand’. Using the past 
tense, however, she focuses on the time when she spoke to the foreigner rather than on t0.) 
 
 
b. 
Bill finally saw the town, which lay in a wide valley.  (The town still lies in that valley, but putting the 
temporal focus on the past time when Bill saw the town is a means of representing things as Bill 
experienced them, i.e. from his point of view.) 
 
 
c. 
I {need / will need} a stamp for this envelope.  (With ‘will need’ the speaker focuses on the post-present 
time when she will make the envelope ready to be sent off.) 
These examples show that tense forms can reflect a choice, not only of temporal location of an STO relative 
to another (S)TO, but also of point of view (temporal focus). Predictability will can be explained similarly as 
a result of putting the temporal focus on a post-present time of evaluation: 
(217) 
a. 
They will be across the border by now. 
 
 
b. 
(when the bell rings)  That will be the milkman. 
 
 
c. 
It will have cost a good deal, I suppose.  (Kruisinga 1931: 497) 
These uses of will can be explained as cases in which the temporal focus is shifted from the present to the 
post-present. Instead of simply claiming that a situation is holding at t0, the speaker suggests that it will 
become apparent in the future that the situation is holding. That is, the speaker takes a post-present time of 
orientation (rather than t0) as the time at which the truth of the statement is evaluated. Needless to say, the 
idea of a post-present evaluation time is essential to these uses of will. Sentences like (217a-c) are not 
interpreted as asserting a fact, but rather as expressing a belief which is expected to be confirmed in the 
future. (Legault [1976: 74] notes that That’ll be the milkman implies something like “as you will see when 
you open the door”. Bennett & Partee [1978: 43] paraphrase John will have eaten the fish by now as “It will 
be known that John has eaten the fish now”. Such a temporal, rather than modal, analysis of will accords with 
the fact that the French future tense, which does not involve the use of an auxiliary, can be used in exactly 
the same way: Ce sera le laitier [‘It will be the milkman’].) 
In sum, our future tense will cover not only the ‘pure future’ interpretation but also the ‘prediction’ sense 
and the ‘predictability’ meaning of will. It should also be noted that be going to-forms will also be treated as 
realizations of the future tense. This is in keeping with the existing literature: in spite of the fact that be going 
to and will / shall are not always interchangeable, some researchers have argued that they do have the same 
basic temporal meaning. After investigating the use of the future tense and the go-future in a variety of 
languages, Fleischman (1982: 97) concludes that her findings “militate strongly in favor of regarding the go-
paradigm as a legitimate future-tense form”. Haegeman (1989: 291) similarly argues “that at the level of 
sentence meaning be going to and shall / will are equivalent, and that the difference between them is to be 
found in the constraints they impose on the processing in context of the utterance in which they occur”. 
The aspect of epistemic modality in the meaning of the future tense entails that a temporal domain created 
by an FPS-form is a kind of intensional domain. (An intensional domain is “a domain of interpretation which 
has its own set of presuppositions and truth conditions, in terms of which propositions can be evaluated and 
interpreted” [Rigter 1982: 96].) As noted by Givón (1973: 101), “the future modality by itself produces 
opacity in its scope”. A subclause that is incorporated in a post-present domain by means of a PPS-form is 
therefore interpreted opaquely (i.e. in terms of a world which is not the speaker’s actual world), whereas a 
subclause that uses the Future Perspective System is interpreted transparently (i.e. in terms of the speaker’s 
actual world). This means that a subclause with a PPS-form is interpreted as part of the prediction made in 
the head clause, whereas a subclause with an FPS-form is interpreted as an independent prediction made at 
t0—see also Wekker (1977: 71). In many cases this distinction is a subtle one and there is hardly any 
difference between the two interpretations. For example, though it seems intuitively clear that (218a-b) are 
interpreted as (219a-b), respectively—see Sampson (1971: 588)—it seems difficult to gauge what is the 
difference in communicative effect between them or to imagine contexts in which only one of them could be 
used. 
(218) 
a. 
John will be elected because he gets more votes than Tom. 
 
 
b. 
John will be elected because he will get more votes than Tom. 
(219) 
a. 
I predict: “John will be elected due to getting more votes than Tom.” 
 
 
b. 
I predict that John will get more votes than Tom and (I predict) that John will be elected because of that. 
However, there are cases in which the distinction becomes very important, viz. when there is some 
compelling reason for the subclause and the head clause to be interpreted in terms of the same intensional 

domain. If there is such a requirement, the Future Perspective System is predictably ruled out from the 
subclause. There are at least two types of subclause in which this may be the case. 
The first type consists of noun clauses depending on a verb of propositional attitude (intensional verb) 
such as a verb of saying or thinking. If the speaker wishes the subclause-situation to be interpreted as 
belonging to the intensional domain set up by the head clause verb (and thus opaquely), verb forms which 
maintain a temporal (and thus an intensional) domain must be used. It follows that, if the head clause uses the 
Future Perspective System, these noun clauses must use the Present Perspective System. (The same is true of 
their subclauses if these are also to be interpreted opaquely.) For example: 
(220) 
a. 
[I can’t give you my umbrella.] My wife will wonder what I {have done / *will have done} with it. 
 
 
b. 
[If you take my ring] YOU will explain to my wife why I {am not wearing / *will not be wearing} it any 
more. 
In these examples will in the head clause creates an intensional domain (a future possible world) of which the 
intensional domain created by wonder or explain is a subdomain. Since the dependent question must belong 
to this subdomain, it must be represented as belonging to the domain created by will. This necessitates using 
the Present Perspective System. (Here and below an asterisk is used to indicate that an FPS-form is not a 
valid alternative to a PPS-form, or vice versa. This does not necessarily imply that the form in question is 
ungrammatical.) 
The second type of subclause requiring the use of the Present Perspective System for this reason is the P-
clause of a pattern 1 open-P conditional. Such open-P conditionals refer to a post-present possible (open) 
world in which P triggers Q, entails Q, defines the relevance of Q, etc. This future possible world constitutes 
an intensional domain, and hence a temporal domain, and both STOs must belong to it. This explains why 
the Q-clause, which defines the central TO of the domain, uses the Future Perspective System while the 
Present Perspective System is the rule in the open P-clause—see also section 5.5.2 below:19 
(221) 
If it {doesn’t / *won’t} rain tomorrow, we will have a picnic. 
Now that we have outlined the model of tense that we are going to work with, we can return to what is the 
subject of investigation in this chapter, viz. the possible tense combinations in the P-clause and the Q-clause 
of the various possible-world types of conditionals. 
 
5.2. The use of tenses in factual-P conditionals 
 
As was noted in section 4.1, there are various constructions in which the P-clause is represented and 
interpreted as factual, i.e. as expressing a proposition that is true in the actual world, or referring to a 
situation that forms part of the actual world. In some of them the Q-clause is factual too, in others it is not. 
We can distinguish the following possibilities: 
 
5.2.1. P-clauses referring to a past or pre-present repetitive habit 
 
P is interpreted as factual when the case-specifying-P conditional refers to a past or pre-present repetitive-
habitual situation. In that case the Q-clause is also factual and has past or pre-present time reference. This 
means that the only tenses that can appear in either of the clauses are the present perfect, the past tense and 
the past perfect, though, of course, not every combination of these tenses is possible. (Thus, the present 
perfect could not substitute for the past tense in the P-clause of [222a].) For example: 
(222) 
a. 
She accepted any patients, on condition that they paid her handsomely.  (past tense Q-clause + past 
tense P-clause) 
 
 
b. 
She accepted anybody as a lodger, provided that she had been paid first.  (past tense Q-clause + past 
perfect P-clause) 
 
 
c. 
For many years she has only bought potatoes if they have been organically grown.  (present perfect Q-
clause + present perfect P-clause) 
                                              
19 Dancygier (1992) and Dancygier & Sweetser (1997: 114) argue for another explanation for the use of the Present Perspective 
System in if-clauses. The claim is that the use of present rather than future forms in P-clauses is part of the general phenomenon 
of ‘tense-backshifting’ which takes place in actualization conditionals, but not in inferentials and “speech-act conditionals”. 
However, it will be clear that the claim about inferentials is mistaken (e.g. If he doesn’t tell us the truth when he comes 
tomorrow, he’ll also have lied to my parents today). Moreover, this analysis seems to ignore the fact that apart from if-clauses 
there are several other clause types that require or allow the use of a PPS-form to express post-present time reference. 

 
 
d. 
All her life she has filled out my tax return forms, on condition that she was paid for it.  (present perfect 
Q-clause + past tense P-clause) 
 
 
e. 
All her life she has accepted anybody as a lodger, provided that she had been paid first.  (present perfect 
Q-clause + past perfect P-clause) 
 
 
f. 
All her life she had filled out my tax return forms, on condition that she was paid for it.  (past perfect Q-
clause + past tense P-clause) 
 
 
g. 
For many years she had only bought potatoes if they had been organically grown.  (past perfect Q-
clause + past perfect P-clause) 
 
 
h. 
If a prisoner was sent to Green Block, he would never return.  (past tense Q-clause + conditional tense 
P-clause) 
It may be noted that in some types of clause, the conditional tense can represent a future-in-the-past situation 
as factual: 
(223) 
None of those who left for the front would ever return. 
However, this use of the conditional tense is not possible in factual P-clauses. In If none of those who left for 
the front would ever return, there must have been a real massacre, the P-clause is echoic and hence treated 
as closed, not factual. 
 
5.2.2. Performative P-clauses 
 
P is also interpreted as factual when the P-clause is used in a performative way, i.e. if it is the very action of 
uttering the P-clause that makes the P-situation actualize. In this case the P-clause uses the present tense, or 
(in FIS or PR=AST) the past tense, and the Q-clause uses one of the present time-sphere tenses or past time-
sphere tenses, accordingly. (By PR=AST we mean a past tense sentence or sequence in a novel or other kind 
of story which is by convention written or narrated in the past tense. Such a past tense sentence refers to the 
present of the novel, i.e. to a present [of a nonfactual world] which is represented as if it were past [in the real 
world]. PR=AST is therefore short for ‘PResent=pAST’ and represents a particular type of shift of temporal 
perspective.) 
(224) 
a. 
[“May I invite you for a drink?”] — “Don’t be disappointed if I say no. [I have some urgent business to 
attend to.]” 
 
 
b. 
[And thirty-four witnesses could testify to that.] Thirty-five, if you included the driver.  (DOC) 
The Q-clause can also be in the imperative mood or otherwise express deontic modality: 
(225) 
[“Will you help me?”] — “You must forgive me if I say no. [I really can’t help you.]” 
 
5.2.3. Factual #P-clauses 
 
In counterfactual-P conditionals, [+p] implies [-p]. Thus, If you had been there, you would have seen me, the 
[+p]-clause implies ‘You were not there’. In section 4.1.3 we referred to this implied [-p]-proposition as #P 
and noted that #P is normally interpreted as closed. The latter conclusion is illustrated by the following: 
(226) 
If she had been honest, she would have told us about it. 
The P-clause here implies the #P-clause ‘She was not honest’, i.e. implies that the speaker believes in the 
nontruth (in the actual world) of the proposition ‘She is / was honest’. However, this does not mean that the 
latter proposition (#[+p]) is presented as factual. It just means that ‘#[+p]’ is presented as being assumed to 
be a fact, i.e. as a closed proposition. Similarly: 
(227) 
If she hadn’t been honest, she would have told us some lie. 
Here too, #P (which is now ‘#[-p]’: ‘she is / was honest’) is believed by the speaker to be true (=closed) but 
is not presented as a factual proposition. 
However, it was also noted in section 4.1.3 that there are three cases in which #P is factual. We will now 
have a brief look at the use of tenses in these three types of conditionals. 
 
5.2.3.1. Counterfactual {unless / if...not}-clauses 
 

As we will see in 13.3.3.2, a P-clause introduced by unless in a counterfactual conditional is interpreted as ‘if 
it weren’t for the fact that’ or ‘if it hadn’t been the case that’. An if...not-clause can be interpreted similarly. 
This reading, in which the if-clause expresses #P (i.e. P, but with reversed polarity), is actually a factual 
interpretation. Thus, when interpreted as (228b), (228a) implies that it is a fact that I am old and weak: 
(228) 
a. 
If I weren’t old and weak, I would go there myself. 
 
 
b. 
If it weren’t for the fact that I am old and weak, I would go there myself. 
Counterfactual conditionals can only be of the canonical tense pattern 3 or (under certain conditions) of 
pattern 2. The above example (228a) illustrates the latter possibility. (The subjunctive form were is an 
alternative to was—see section 6.1.2.) The following examples illustrate the use of pattern 3 tenses: 
(229) 
a. 
If he hadn’t been my best friend, I would have punched him in the face. 
 
 
b. 
Unless you had told me, I would never have known about it. 
 
5.2.3.2. Ad absurdum conditionals 
 
In ad absurdum conditionals, P is ultimately interpreted as counterfactual, which means that #P (=not-P) is 
read as factual (true in the actual world). Because the P-clause is echoic, it is treated by the speaker as 
(ostensibly) closed—see also immediately below. As we will see in section 5.4, any tense that can refer to the 
actual world is possible in the P-clause and Q-clause of a closed-P conditional.20 Thus, any of the P-clauses 
in (230) can in principle combine with any of the Q-clauses in (231). (The “in principle” is added because ad 
absurdum-conditionals are stereotyped up to a point. The most typical is probably the ‘present tense P + 
present tense Q’ pattern exemplified in If that’s true, I’m a Dutchman! Moreover, pigs will fly is not 
normally used after a P-clause that does not refer to the future.) 
(230) 
{If you are a systems analyst / If you made this drawing / If you have just won £10,000 / If you will meet the 
Queen tomorrow / If you had met her the day before / If you will have finished this by tomorrow} 
(231) 
{I’m Dracula. / pigs will fly. / I wrote Moby Dick. / I’ve just been elected president. / I will be flying to Mars 
tomorrow.} 
It was noted in section 4.2.4.4 that the P-clauses of such conditionals are treated as ostensibly closed, and in 
section 4.2.4.1 that (ostensibly) closed P-clauses use the Future Perspective System (i.e. the future tense, the 
future perfect or be going to) when the time reference is to the post-present, as in the following example: 
(232) 
[Yet we managers still do it—to burn off nervous energy, I suppose. The players either can’t hear you or 
cock a deaf ‘un because they don’t want to hear you. And the way our place will be buzzing today,] I’ll be a 
monkey’s uncle if anyone will be able to hear a word I say.  (COB-S) 
 
5.2.3.3. Other indirect inferentials 
 
In other counterfactual indirect inferentials the #P-reading is similarly factual: 
(233) 
a. 
If (as you say) he really fought in Vietnam for three years, he would {know / have known} a lot about 
warfare.  (inferred #P: he did not fight in Vietnam for three years) 
 
 
b. 
But Superman wouldn’t be Superman if he didn’t solve that problem too.  (inferred #P: Superman did 
solve that problem) 
 
5.3. The use of tenses in neutral-P conditionals 
 
As we saw in section 4.2.2, neutral-P conditionals form a first type of theoretical-world conditional. It is 
typical of the latter that P is not represented as true in the actual world, i.e. the speaker does not commit 
herself to the truth of P. P therefore creates a ‘theoretical P-world’, i.e. a possible world which is different 
from the actual world, and which may or may not carry a presupposition (assumption) relating it to the latter. 
The two possibilities (inherent in may or may not) lead to the distinction between ‘nonneutral’ and ‘neutral’ 
theoretical-P conditionals. The former have been further subclassified on the basis of whether they 
                                              
20 In addition, P (but not Q) can have tenses referring to a specifically nonfactual world: If you would have finished by Friday [if I 
hadn’t disturbed you], I’m a Dutchman. This is only possible if the superficial P-clause is actually the Q-clause of a ‘covert-P 
conditional’—see section 11.7.1. 

presuppose P to be true, possibly true, unlikely to be true, or false. We speak of closed-P, open-P, tentative-P 
and counterfactual-P conditionals, respectively. Neutral P-conditionals, by contrast, make no assumption as 
to the relation between the P-world and the actual world. The speaker uses the P-clause to express no more 
than a pure supposition about theoretical cases. That is, there is no assumption that the case(s) referred to are 
true, false, possibly true, or unlikely to be (or become) true in the real world. 
In section 4.2.2 we distinguished seven types of neutral-P conditionals. In some of them (e.g. the gnomic 
ones) only the present tense can be used. In the others it is generally the case that the P-clause can use any of 
the absolute tenses. Because there are no fewer than seven subtypes involved, it would take us too far to 
analyse the tense possibilities for each of them in detail. We will therefore restrict ourselves to giving the 
following illustrations: 
(234) 
a. 
[The bottom line is that] if you use a fragrance that makes you feel good, your confidence will receive a 
healthy boost.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
Please mention the Glasgow Guzzler when talking to publicans and bar staff especially if you visited 
the pub after reading an advertisement.  (COB-W) (The ‘Glasgow Guzzler’ is a brochure containing the 
names of pubs in Glasgow.) 
 
 
c. 
If you haven’t got a life insurance policy yet, we strongly advise you to read the following text 
carefully. 
 
 
d. 
If you have enjoyed shopping from the Friends of the Earth catalogue, you may like us to send a copy to 
some of your friends and relatives.  (COB-W) 
Particularly noteworthy is the use of FPS-forms (will, be going to...) in neutral P-clauses referring to the post-
present—a use which is not possible in open-P conditionals. It implies that the speaker takes it for granted 
that there are at least some people for whom the future P-situation will actualize: 
(235) 
a. 
If you will be alone on Christmas Day, let us know now.  (Close 1980: 104) 
 
 
b. 
(spoken at end of the 9 o’clock news bulletin)  If you won’t be with us for the late news, goodnight.  
(Haegeman & Wekker 1984: 53) 
 
 
c. 
If you will not receive a scholarship or award, please tell us how you intend to meet the expenses of 
living in London and taking our course.  (Haegeman 1983: 153) 
 
 
d. 
If you are going to work in another EC country for a UK employer for more than 12 months or to work 
for a foreign employer, form E111 is not appropriate.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
[Will more than one person need to use the computer at one time?] It is no use giving a partner a 
terminal if it will not be used.  (COB-W) 
 
 
f. 
[Read the note attached to your E111 before you travel. It will tell you how to get emergency medical 
treatment in each European Community country. ... ] If you will need medical treatment while you are 
abroad, see page 20.  (COB-W) 
 
 
g. 
The tax relief on the pension contributions is worth having if you qualify for the tax-free lump sum or if 
you will pay a lower rate of tax on the benefits than the tax relief you received when you made the 
contribution.  (COB-W) 
 
 
h. 
[If you suffer stress for less than a year you receive a statutory £4,000. If more than a year, you receive 
£7,500.] If you will suffer the effects for the rest of your life, you receive the £20,000. 
 
 
i. 
[Will you eat today?] If you will, then please spare something for an old person overseas [who will be 
‘lucky’ to have even one scanty meal.]  (Haegeman 1983: 153) 
The speaker here assumes that there are addressees for whom the condition mentioned is fulfilled. The Q-
situation (which follows logically if the condition is fulfilled in the present) can therefore be a present 
situation (or, as in the first three examples, the present performance of an imperative or imperative-like 
illocutionary speech act). 
In sum, neutral P-clauses as a rule use absolute tenses, not relative ones. (Some stereotyped relative tenses 
can be found, as in [236a-b], but they are used with a modal rather than temporal meaning.) 
(236) 
a. 
If you would like to host a Tupperware party, ring Sarah. 
 
 
b. 
If you had hoped to have everything ready on time this Christmas, but have failed yet again, here’s our 
last-minute life-saver. 
The claim that neutral P-clauses as a rule use absolute tenses applies even to the last sentence of the 
following example: 
(237) 
[The boys swimming on the two nights are listed overleaf. If your son will be nine years old on Sunday 25th 
March he will swim on Wednesday 8th February.] If he is eight or ten on 25th March he will swim on 1st 
February.  (COB-W) 

Here is is not a PPS-form (relative tense form) but an absolute tense form: the present tense is used because 
there is a shift of perspective from the future to the present (as is typical of statements about a timetable, the 
calendar, etc.—e.g. The train leaves at 6.45 a.m.; I am 34 tomorrow). 
As to the use of tenses in the Q-clause of a neutral-P conditional, there is no a priori restriction, except 
that the Q-tense must be in keeping with the particular kind of neutral-P conditional in which it is used. In 
most examples the Q-clause uses the present tense. However, there are other possibilities, witness the 
following: 
(238) 
a. 
If you’re borrowing at twenty per cent and your investment yields twenty two per cent then you’ve 
made a profit.  (COB-W) (gnomic) 
 
 
b. 
[The main thing about film-making is to find stories which have something to say, he maintains. If you 
want to be in for the long haul, you just have to trust your judgement.] If you just go whoring for the 
money, the audiences will figure you out.  (COB-W) (gnomic) 
 
 
c. 
If you use three burners for, say, two hours per day, that would give you enough gas for 27 days.  
(COB-W) (nonspecific addressee) 
 
 
d. 
[The interest rate’s so high ... <that>] if you’re borrowing to invest you would be deterred <from 
borrowing>.  (COB-S) (nonspecific addressee) 
Perhaps we should devote a final remark to neutral-P conditionals with an imaginary P-clause. Since these 
are a subtype of irrealis conditionals and are normally embedded in a counterfactual context, they typically 
have the form of pattern 2 or pattern 3: 
(239) 
a. 
In your place I wouldn’t reply if he wrote me a letter.  (post-present time reference) 
 
 
b. 
In your place I wouldn’t have replied if he’d written me a letter.  (past time reference) 
The use of tenses in imaginary-P conditionals will be further investigated in sections 7.2.2.4 and 7.3.3.2. 
 
5.4. The use of tenses in closed-P conditionals 
 
5.4.1. Introduction 
 
In section 4.2.4 we saw that in closed-P conditionals, P is assumed (or ostensibly assumed) to be true. That 
is, a closed P is a proposition that is true in a closed world. A closed P-world is a theoretical P-world 
described by propositions that are assumed to be true. These propositions may relate to various possible 
worlds. This comes about because the P-proposition that is assumed to be true may either echo a proposition 
about the actual world or it may echo the Q-proposition of a closed-P, open-P, tentative-P or counterfactual-P 
conditional. For example: 
(240) 
a. 
[“It is the 5th of May tomorrow.”] — “If it is 5 May tomorrow, it’s high time we finished the 
documents for the meeting of 6 May.”  (The P-clause echoes a sentence about the actual world.) 
 
 
b. 
[“I would be able to open that safe in five minutes.”] — “If even you would be able to open that safe in 
five minutes, we’d better not use it any more.”  (The P-clause echoes the Q-clause of a tentative-P 
conditional with a ‘covert’—see section 11.7.1— P-clause, such as ‘if you tried’.) 
 
 
c. 
[“I wouldn’t have reached the finish if I hadn’t taken a stimulant.”] — “If even you wouldn’t have 
reached the finish without taking a stimulant, then there is no doubt that all the other competitors used 
stimulants too.”  (The P-clause echoes the Q-clause of a counterfactual-P conditional.) 
However, because, other things being equal, the actual world is the most relevant (and hence the unmarked) 
world to the speaker and hearer, the closed-P world in which a P-proposition is true is normally taken to be 
like the actual world, unless there is an indication to the contrary. 
 
5.4.2. Tense combinations in closed-P conditionals 
 
If P echoes a proposition about the actual world or echoes the Q-proposition of a closed-P conditional, any 
nonmodal or modal verb form that can be used to refer to the actual world or to express a closed assumption 
about it can also be used to refer to the P-situation or the Q-situation in the closed theoretical world. For 
example, any of the following P-clauses can combine with any of the following Q-clauses: 
 
P-clause: 
 
 
If he is with Joan now 
 
 
If he was with Joan last Sunday 

 
 
If he has been with Joan for some time 
 
 
If (as you say) he {will / is going to} be with Joan tomorrow 
 
 
If he had been with Joan before 
 
 
If (as I was told) he {would / was going to} be with Joan the day after 
 
 
If (as I believe) he will have been with Joan before tonight 
 
 
If he {must / will / may...} have been with Joan at the time 
 
 
If he {is to / has to / can...} see Joan tomorrow 
 
Q-clause: 
 
 
he is cheating on his wife. 
 
 
he was with her on Monday too. 
 
 
they have no doubt been together many times. 
 
 
they {will / are going to} meet again. 
 
 
he had also been with her when I met him yesterday. 
 
 
their relation will have been discovered before long. 
 
 
they {must / will / may...} be lovers. 
 
 
he will {have to / be able to / be allowed to...} see her again soon. 
Note that these examples show that in closed-P conditionals, the tense forms in both clauses have their 
normal temporal meanings—see also Dancygier (1988b: 126)—and that the temporal reference is expressed 
in the same way as in independent clauses. This is further illustrated by the following examples: 
(241) 
a. 
[“There’s nothing more to say.”] — “But if you felt—feel—so strongly, why didn’t you agree to give 
evidence at the Inquest?”  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
If he will be in London from tomorrow onwards, it was pointless to send the files to his home this 
morning. 
 
 
c. 
If, as is forecast, the river is going to rise as high as this, the meadows over there will be inundated. 
 
 
d. 
If Claude will be here tomorrow, there’s no need to call him now.  (Close 1980: 107) 
As is clear from the latter two examples, closed P-clauses referring to the post-present use FPS-forms (built 
with will or be going to) rather than PPS-forms.21 That is, they (predictably) use the same tense system as is 
used in the independent clauses which they echo. 
An exception to the rule that in closed-P conditionals, the tense forms in both clauses have their normal 
temporal meanings is when the P-clause echoes a tentative or counterfactual statement. In that case the tense 
form of the closed P-clause receives the same modal interpretation as that of its source sentence: 
(242) 
a. 
[I’d be delighted to help her.] — If you’d be delighted to help her, you must like her very much. 
 
 
b. 
If only 400 weapons would destroy the Soviets, what would 17,000 weapons do to the world?  
(Jacobsson 1984: 141) 
 
5.4.3. Closed P-clauses functioning as Q-clauses 
 
As we noted in section 4.2.4, closed P-clauses are typically echoic, i.e. they echo an actual utterance or an 
unspoken thought. Since what is echoed may be the Q-clause of another conditional, the P-clause of a closed 
conditional may itself be the Q-clause of an open-P, tentative-P or counterfactual-P conditional (the P-clause 
of which is often not overtly present but implied by the rest of the conditional): 
(243) 
a. 
If (as we believe) it’ll please your parents (if we marry), then we’d better get married soon.  (The P-
clause ‘if we marry’ is ‘implicit’ in the pronoun ‘it’—see 11.7.9.) 
 
 
b. 
If (as you say) it will help you (if I lend you £10), I am willing to lend you £10.  (id.) 
 
 
c. 
If (as you say) you would be able to open my financial files (if you found my pass-word), I had better 
choose a less obvious pass-word.  (The P-clause is not ‘implicit’ but ‘covert’—see section 11.7.1.) 
 
 
d. 
If (as you say) you would have been able to open my safe (if you had wanted) when you visited my 
house, it is time I bought a more sophisticated one.  (id.) 
 
 
e. 
[All right, Karin!] If it’ll make you happy I’ll have a bloody sandwich!  (COB-W)  (implicit P-clause) 
In all these examples, if can be paraphrased as ‘if (as I assume) it is the case that’, which paraphrase is typical 
of closed conditions. This explains the seemingly abnormal use of (nonvolitional) will (=Future Perspective 
System) or would in the P-clause. 
                                              
21 Observations about and/or discussions of this use of will are to be found in e.g. Close (1980), Comrie (1982, 1986), Dancygier 
(1988b: 126-127), Declerck (1991a: 198-210, 1991b: 426-427), Declerck & Depraetere (1995), Dudman (1984), Haegeman 
(1983), Haegeman & Wekker (1984), Jacobsson (1984), Nieuwint (1986), Tregidgo (1974, 1979, 1980). 

 
5.4.4. Closed P-clauses using the Future Perspective System 
 
We strongly disagree with Tedeshi’s (1977: 634) claim that “conditional if-clauses do not allow an embedded 
future modal”. The same claim is also made by Werth (1997: 107): “there is no true future use of will or 
would in the if-clause” of a conditional. (Werth is speaking of conditionals generally, not of a particular 
type.) The explanation Werth adduces for this supposed fact is that the tenses of all conditionals are the result 
of a “backward shift”: “the apparent present tense in a Conditional I if-clause is actually a remote future. ... 
An ‘underlying’ or ‘actual’ or ‘semantic’ future gets shifted back to a present. Since there is no ‘plufuture’ 
tense form, there is no chance of (plain) future being a result of this process.” (p. 108) Needless to say, our 
explanation of the use of the Present Perspective System in open conditionals (but not in factual or closed 
ones!) is completely different from this—see section 5.1. 
As a matter of fact, the previous two subsections have revealed that there are two types of closed P-clause 
that use an FPS-form to refer to the post-present. One is when the P-clause is itself the Q-clause of an (overt, 
implicit or covert) open conditional, as in the following (which are similar to the first two examples in the 
preceding section): 
(244) 
a. 
I’ll not go if (as you say) there will be trouble if I go.  (overt P-clause: ‘If I go’) 
 
 
b. 
I’ll not go if (as you say) there will be trouble.  (covert P-clause: ‘If I go’) 
 
 
c. 
If it will help you <if I lend you a fiver>, I will lend you a fiver.  (The P-clause ‘if I lend you a giver’ is 
implicit in ‘it’.) 
In the latter example, the P-clause expresses a condition that is closed in the sense that it is understood as ‘If 
you can now confirm that it is a fact that + future tense’. Because the overt P-clause is really the Q-clause of 
an implicit P-clause, the auxiliary referring to the future is normally will, not be going to. As is well-
known—see e.g. Palmer (1990: 114-118)—a sentence like She’s going to be disappointed if he shouldn’t 
come is odd—the normal form being will be disappointed—because be going to as a rule presupposes that all 
the conditions for the future actualization of the situation are already fulfilled—see Declerck (1991b: 115). 
The second type of closed P-clause that uses the Future Perspective System is that in which the echoic P-
condition is closed in the sense that the post-present P-situation is taken for granted, i.e. when the speaker 
treats the future factual status of the P-situation as beyond doubt. In this case be going to is more common 
than will: 
(245) 
a. 
If (as you tell me) he {?will pay / will be paying / is going to pay / is paying} us a visit tomorrow, there 
is no point in sending him a letter today. 
 
 
b. 
[“My secretary {is going to / *will} have a baby.” — “That’s nice for her.”] — “Yes, but if she {is 
going to / *will} have a baby I will have to do all the paperwork myself.” 
 
 
c. 
If I’m going to catch the 5.12 train, I’d better be on my way now.  (The P-clause refers to what the 
speaker / thinker intends [wants, expects] to happen and which she therefore takes for granted, but the 
P-situation is clearly not a fact yet, as its actualization is located in the future.) 
 
 
d. 
[It was six o’clock on a Friday evening, Friday, October 10th.] If he was going to do it he’d better start 
on the organization tomorrow.  (ADIMV) (free indirect speech: P is again the echo of an internal 
speech sentence, i.e. a thought.) 
In examples like these, both clauses of the conditional use an absolute tense, which means that the temporal 
order of the P- and Q-situations is not expressed by the tense forms. Consider: 
(246) 
a. 
If (as you say) he will be on holiday from tomorrow, I will not contact him until he is back. 
 
 
b. 
If (as you say) he will be on holiday from tomorrow, I will try to contact him this afternoon. 
The P-situation precedes the Q-situation in the former example, but follows it in the latter. This proves that 
this kind of conditional expresses no more than that the speaker infers from the truth (or, if P is modalized, 
the relative truth) of a P-proposition (concerning the post-present) in a closed world to the truth (or relative 
truth) of a Q-proposition (also concerning the future) in the same world. That is, both the P-situation and the 
Q-situation are located in the same theoretical world, but nothing is said about the temporal relation between 
them. This shows that closed-P conditionals in which both clauses are assertions do not state a link between 
two situations (actualizations) but rather between the truth of two tensed propositions.22 In other words, 
                                              
22 When the Q-clause is an assertion, the Q-proposition may be deontically modalized (e.g. If he will come here himself 
tomorrow, I’d better speak to him then), but this does not alter the fact that Q has a truth value. 

such conditionals are inferential conditionals. (As we saw in section 4.2.4, this is in fact true of all closed-P 
conditionals which are not premodified reduced it-clefts or nonassertoric Q-utterance conditionals.) 
The following are some further illustrations of the use of the Future Perspective System in closed-P 
clauses. 
(247) 
a. 
If all the letters {will / are going to} be finished by 4 o’clock, why don’t you ask Gordon to post them 
on his way home? 
 
 
b. 
If he {will / is going to} be abroad for the next two months, then we had better try and see him now. 
 
 
c. 
What point is there in saving up for a trip if you won’t be able to make it anyhow? 
 
 
d. 
You ought to lock your doors if you’re going to stay here.  (DOJ) 
 
 
e. 
If the water level {will / is going to} rise as high as this, then we ought to evacuate these houses. 
 
 
f. 
If Bill {will / is going to} be here tomorrow, there’s no need to ring him now. 
 
 
g. 
[“Madonna will be the next President of the USA.”] — “If Madonna will be the next President of the 
USA, I’m Dracula.” 
 
 
h. 
[Extra income would go instead principally towards continuing the process of cleaning up the Algerian 
economy whose shortcomings were painfully exposed by the oil price drop of the mid-80s and towards 
increasing the Central Bank’s reserves.] But even if consumers will not benefit straight away from 
Algeria’s new money the government can expect to regain some of its lost prestige among the voters.  
(The P-clause echoes a proposition which is inferrable, since ‘new money’ echoes ‘extra money’.) 
In sentences like these, the if-clause echoes either a statement which has just been made or a thought which 
the speaker has just had. Because of this, the condition represented by the P-clause is not an open one: the 
condition is represented, not as possible, but as one which the speaker assumes to be fulfilled in the future. 
The Q-clause expresses a conclusion (concerning the future or the present) which the speaker has reached on 
the basis of her assumption that the P-situation will actualize. In the above examples, this conclusion either 
concerns a present or future course of action or is a conclusion concerning the truth of the Q-clause. The 
phenomenon is, however, not restricted to P-clauses with future time reference. Closed P-clauses may refer 
to any time: 
(248) 
a. 
[“I’m afraid I’ve made a mistake.”] — “If you’ve made a mistake, you may be fired.” 
 
 
b. 
If you lived in London for all those years, I expect you miss the theatres and shops? 
 
 
c. 
If (as you say) you were in London yesterday, you’ll know how awful the traffic is there now. 
So far we have discussed closed P-clauses using the Future Perspective System to refer to the post-present. 
The following are examples which are different only in that there is past time reference. They are inferentials 
in which the closed P-clause uses the past counterpart of the Future Perspective System to express 
posteriority in a past domain: 
(249) 
a. 
[He said] he wouldn’t come if I was going to be there.  (SHF) 
 
 
b. 
[I knew] he wouldn’t hesitate to kill if killing was going to rid him of further persecution. 
 
5.4.5. Closed-P inferentials in (free) indirect speech 
 
If the closed P-clause expresses an assumption about a past situation, the time of making the inference 
expressed by ‘if P, then Q’ may be either present (current speech time) or past (some past time of speaking / 
thinking). The latter interpretation occurs in IRS (indirect reported speech) and FIS (free indirect speech). 
Compare the sentences in the following pairs: 
(250) 
a. 
[“I was with Joan last Saturday.”] — “If you were with her on Saturday, then you must know each other 
well.”  (The Q-clause expresses a present conclusion.) 
 
 
b. 
If (as he said) he was with Joan that Saturday, then they had to know each other well.  (FIS) (The Q-
clause expresses a conclusion arrived at in the past.) 
(251) 
a. 
If, as you say, Harold succeeded Edward the Confessor, then he can’t have been born when you say he 
was.  (The Q-clause expresses a present conclusion.) 
 
 
b. 
[I was very surprised by her claim that it was Harold who succeeded Edward the Confessor.] If Harold 
succeeded Edward the Confessor, then he had to have been born earlier than I had initially thought.  
(FIS) (The Q-clause expresses a conclusion arrived at at some past time.) 
 
5.4.6. Closed-P inferentials expressing a past conclusion about an anticipated past P-situation 
 

If the closed P-clause uses the conditional tense or the conditional perfect in order to refer to an anticipated 
(but still nonfactual) past P-situation, the time of making the inference expressed by ‘if P, then Q’ can only 
be some past time of speaking or thinking. In other words, such conditionals only occur in IRS, FIS or 
PR=AST. 
(252) 
If (as I had been told) they would be back any minute, they had certainly driven at a dangerous speed. 
 
5.4.7. Closed-P inferentials expressing a past conclusion about an anterior P-situation 
 
In FIS or PR=AST both clauses of an inferential conditional can represent the time of the P-situation as T-
anterior to a past time of orientation, which is the time when the conclusion was reached. Compare: 
(253) 
a. 
If, as we know, he had promised Margaret that he’d give her the translation on Friday, he {had no doubt 
finished / must have finished} it by Thursday night when you rang him.  (present conclusion: direct 
speech) 
 
 
b. 
If he had been there at the time, he had no doubt seen everything.  (past conclusion: FIS) 
(254) 
a. 
[“I’m certain that John was there when Sally washed the blood off her clothes.”] — “If John was there 
at the time, he will no doubt have warned the police before the end of the day.”  (direct speech) 
 
 
b. 
[Martin turned things over in his mind. Jim was certain that John had been there when Sally washed the 
blood off her clothes.] If John had been there at the time, he would no doubt have warned the police 
before the end of the day.  (FIS or PR=AST) 
As will be noted in section 7.3, the combination of a P-clause in the past perfect and a Q-clause in the 
conditional perfect in examples such as (254b) testifies to the fact that pattern 3 examples need not be 
counterfactual. The same conclusion can be drawn from pattern 3 conditionals whose Q-clause uses 
epistemic might or could: 
(255) 
If, as I knew to be the case, she had been on deck at the time of the murder, she {might / could} have seen 
what was happening.  (past conclusion: FIS) 
 
5.4.8. Closed P-clauses combining with a Q-clause referring to another possible world 
 
In most closed-P conditionals, the Q-clause refers to the actual world (which is the unmarked world). 
However, examples can be found in which a closed P-clause combines with a Q-clause referring to a 
theoretical world: 
(256) 
a. 
If (as you tell me and I assume) she is seriously ill, she will perhaps be taken to hospital.  (P is closed, 
Q refers to an open world.) 
 
 
b. 
[“Your bookkeeper is absolutely reliable.”] — “If that’s true (and I believe it is), he would never try to 
embezzle money from my firm, would he?” — [“Certainly not.”]  (closed P + tentative Q) 
A special type of such a hybrid conditional is that in which an ostensibly closed P-clause combines with a 
counterfactual Q-clause: 
(257) 
a. 
If (as you say) he really fought in Vietnam for three years, he would {know / have known} a lot about 
warfare. 
 
 
b. 
If your late father was as clever as you always claim, he wouldn’t have gone bankrupt. 
Sentences like these represent a type of indirect inferential: from the fact that Q (whether [+q] or [-q]) is 
counterfactual we deduce that P must also be counterfactual (although its verb form does not represent it as 
such: for the sake of the argument, the speaker purports to treat P as closed, but then she makes it clear that 
this interpretation must be reconsidered.) As in other indirect inferentials, the P-clauses of these examples are 
typically echoic. 
Note, however, that examples such as those above are potentially ambiguous. In some contexts they will 
not be interpreted as counterfactual (in spite of the fact that the Q-clause uses the conditional perfect tense): 
(258) 
[Jane says it was her late husband who scratched out her left eye, but I don’t believe her, because she’s lied 
before, and] if, as everyone says, he never hurt a fly, he wouldn’t have treated his wife so cruelly. 
In this example, the conditional perfect in the Q-clause is interpreted as making a prediction about the past. It 
does not trigger a counterfactual interpretation of P. 

On the other hand, a comparative in the Q-clause enforces a counterfactual reading of P if the comparison 
concerns a theoretical actualization of the Q-situation versus its real actualization (in the actual world) 
effected by the same agent: 
(259) 
“John was a very clever boy.” — “If he was as clever as you claim, he would have been able to solve that 
simple problem more quickly.”  (more quickly = ‘more quickly than he did’) (Note that a marker of 
comparison in the Q-clause does not have this effect if other things are compared: “If he was as clever as 
you always claim, he would have been able to solve that simple problem more quickly than you, so why 
didn’t you ask him to?”) 
Another type of hybrid conditional is that in which a closed P-clause combines with a tentative Q-clause (of 
canonical pattern 2): 
(260) 
a. 
If, as I believe, there is treasure, it {will / would} be hidden here. 
 
 
b. 
If, as I believe, there is treasure hidden here, it {will / would} have been buried in something like a lead 
casket. 
‘Backshifting’ will (expressing predictability) to would renders the Q-prediction more tentative. 
 
5.5. The use of tenses in open-P conditionals 
 
5.5.1. General rule 
 
We have seen that a closed P is true in a closed theoretical P-world and is assumed to be true in the actual 
world. (Naturally, the latter claim does not apply to closed-P conditionals whose P-clause is really the Q-
clause of a covert-P or implicit-P conditional, as in If it will help you, I am willing to lend you ten pounds, 
which is interpreted as ‘If it will help you if I lend you ten pounds, I am willing to lend you ten pounds.’) By 
contrast, an open P is true in an open theoretical P-world and is assumed to be possibly true in the actual 
world. In open-P conditionals the same tense combinations are possible as in closed-P conditionals, except 
for the fact that an open P-clause referring to the post-present cannot use an FPS-tense (e.g. the future tense 
or the future perfect) and that an open P-clause expressing T-posteriority to a past time of orientation cannot 
use the past counterpart of an FPS-tense (e.g. the conditional tense or the conditional perfect). Thus, any of 
the following P-clauses can in principle combine with any of the following Q-clauses: 
 
P-clause: 
 
 
I don’t know if he is with Joan now, but if he is, 
 
 
I don’t know if he was with Joan last Sunday, but if he was, 
 
 
I don’t know if he has been with Joan for some time, but if he has, 
 
 
I don’t know if he {will / is going to} be with Joan tomorrow, but if he {is / *will be} <with her tomorrow>, 
 
 
I don’t know if he had been with Joan before, but if he had, 
 
 
I don’t know if he {would / was going to} be with Joan the day after, but if he {was / *would be}, 
 
 
I don’t know if he will have been with Joan before tonight, but if he has been, 
 
 
I don’t know if he {is to / has to / can...} see Joan tomorrow, but if he {is to / has to / can...}, 
 
Q-clause: 
 
 
he is cheating on his wife. 
 
 
he was with her on Monday too. 
 
 
they have no doubt been together many times. 
 
 
they {will / are going to} meet again. 
 
 
he had also been with her when I met him yesterday. 
 
 
their relation will have been discovered before long. 
 
 
they {must / will / may / might / could} be lovers. 
 
 
he will {have to / be able to / be allowed to...} see her again soon. 
The following further illustrate the various possible time references in the Q-clause: 
(261) 
a. 
[Ask for her help.] If she loves you, she will help you. If she doesn’t, she’s never really loved you. 
 
 
b. 
[I don’t know if the inspector had expected to find anything of significance in Betty’s room.] If he had, 
he was no doubt disappointed. 
It should be noted that the full plethora of tense combination possibilities is available in inferential 
conditionals (like those above), but not necessarily in the other case-specifying types (i.e. in actualization 
conditionals or purely case-specifying-P conditionals). This becomes clear when we compare the following: 

(262) 
a. 
If he is caught in a traffic jam, he’ll be late.  (actualization-triggering-P) 
 
 
b. 
If he’s late, he’s been caught in a traffic jam.  (inferential reading; no actualization-triggering-P 
reading because the inferential is a ‘backtracker’, i.e. a direct inferential in which the Q-situation 
precedes the P-situation—see section 9.2.2.2) 
 
 
c. 
If John hits Bill, Bill will hit back.  (actualization-triggering-P) 
 
 
d. 
If John has hit Bill, Bill will have hit back.  (inferential reading) (The reason why there is no 
actualization-triggering-P reading here is the following. Hitting someone can cause that person to hit 
back. But having hit someone cannot cause that person to have hit back. On the other hand, ‘X has hit 
Y’ can easily be a premise for inferring the predictability of the truth of ‘Y has hit back’.) 
 
 
e. 
If John’s been to town today, he will have spent all his money in the sales.  (inferential reading; no 
actualization-triggering-P reading) 
 
 
f. 
[Let her sister go with her, then] if she’s homesick she’ll have someone with her that she knows.  
(purely case-specifying-P) 
When dealing with the three canonical patterns (illustrated by I will be happy if she comes, I’d be happy if 
she came and I would’ve been happy if she’d come), Harder (1996: 452) writes that one form “is missing in 
the series”: 
(263) 
?If John has done it, he will have been caught. 
However, though this sentence may be unacceptable on the actualization-triggering-P reading, it can be 
acceptable on an inferential reading (with will implying predictability), as in the following contexts: 
(264) 
a. 
[They’ve arrested everyone who’s ever bought drugs from that man. So] if John has (ever) done it he 
will have been caught.  (open P-clause) 
 
 
b. 
[John should have blown up the Post Office by now, but the police heard about the plan, so] if John HAS 
done it, he will have been caught.  (open P-clause) 
 
 
c. 
[They’ve arrested everyone who’s ever bought drugs from that man. So] If, as you say, John has done 
it, he will have been caught.  (closed P-clause) 
 
5.5.2. Open P-clauses referring to the post-present 
 
Unlike the P-clause of a closed-P conditional, the P-clause of an open-P conditional referring to the post-
present normally has to use the Present Perspective System. The only systematic exceptions to this rule are 
(a) when the P-clause is actually the Q-clause of an (overt or implicit) open P-clause, (b) when the P-clause 
forms part of a ‘relevance conditional’ whose Q-clause does not refer to the post-present, and (c) when the 
open P-clause is used as a ‘postscript’. Apart from these exceptions, which we will go into below, an open P-
clause referring to the post-present has to use the Present Perspective System. The reason for the obligatory 
use of the Present Perspective System is the following. As we have seen, the temporal domain established by 
a Q-clause referring to the post-present functions as an intensional domain. In open-P conditionals referring 
to the post-present, this intensional domain coincides with the intensional domain evoked by the P-clause. It 
follows that the P-clause-STO (=the time of the predicated P-situation) must be located in the temporal Q-
domain, i.e. that the P-clause must represent its STO as temporally subordinated to the Q-clause-STO. In 
open-P conditionals, temporal subordination is thus the linguistic means of expressing a logical connection 
between P and Q, such as cause and effect, or premise and conclusion. The temporal relation in question 
(between the P-clause-STO and the Q-clause-STO) is usually that of T-anteriority (e.g. He will be surprised 
if Bill has left) or T-simultaneity. In the latter case, the interpretation may be in terms of true W-simultaneity 
(e.g. The child will gradually stop crying if you rock her) or ‘sloppy’ (see section 5.1) W-simultaneity (e.g. 
You will be punished if you do that). However, the expression of T-posteriority is not impossible: 
(265) 
a. 
[Try to find out whether or not John will attend the meeting.] If he will attend it, we will have to consult 
our solicitor before the meeting takes place. 
 
 
b. 
[In order to see whether the baby will be a boy or a girl, put the pregnant woman in the middle of a 
flock of wrens. The baby will be a boy if they fly away in terror, because white boys stalk and torture 
and kill them.] If it will be a girl, they will cluster around singing, [because girls grind grain and scatter 
some for the wrens.]  (adapted from example cited by Jacobsson [1984: 140]) 
In these examples the future tense forms in the P-clauses are Present Perspective System forms expressing T-
posteriority to the post-present (but treated as pseudo-present) time of the Q-situation. 

In most cases such a Present Perspective System form expressing T-posteriority will make use of be going 
to or be about to because the T-posteriority relation has a “prospective” (Jespersen 1932: 361-2) connotation: 
(266) 
a. 
The police will not intervene unless the hooligans {are going to / are about to / *will} use violence.  
(=The police will intervene only if they anticipate violence.) 
 
 
b. 
If there’s going to be a hard frost I’ll put some protection over the camellia. 
 
 
c. 
I’ll ring you up if I’m going to be late for dinner.  (Jacobsson 1984:132) 
In such examples we need an auxiliary with ‘prospective’ meaning, i.e. an auxiliary which represents a post-
present situation as anticipated, i.e. as “resulting from, determined by, or contingent upon present 
circumstances” (Fleischman 1982: 19). (Because of its prospective meaning, be going to differs from will in 
that it presupposes that all the necessary conditions for the actualization of the future situation are satisfied—
see Binnick 1972: 7.) In this respect, open P-clauses are similar to adverbial when-clauses. As noted in 
Declerck (1997: 127), the expression of T-posteriority also requires a prospective auxiliary in adverbial 
when-clauses depending on a head clause in the future tense: 
(267) 
The police will intervene when the hooligans are going to / are about to / *will} use violence 
It is important to see that in (266)-(267) be going to is used as a Present Perspective System auxiliary: the 
situation of the if/when-clause is temporally subordinated to that of the head clause. As noted above, the 
Future Perspective System, which involves (nonvolitional) will or be going to, cannot normally be used in an 
open P-clause. 
As was pointed out at the beginning of this section, there are only three systematic exceptions to this rule. 
The first is when the P-clause is actually the Q-clause of an ‘implicit’ open P-clause. (In section 5.4.3 above 
we have observed the same thing in connection with closed-P conditionals.) As explained in section 11.9, an 
implicit P-clause is one that is not overtly expressed as such but is implicit in a nominal constituent (usually 
it or that) in the (pseudo-P) Q-clause, as in I will give you £10 if that will help, which is interpreted as ‘I will 
give you £10 if it will help if I give you £10’ and in which the P-clause ‘if I give you £10’ is thus implicit in 
that. 
When the overt P-clause is actually the Q-clause of an implicit open P-clause, it uses the Future 
Perspective System to refer to the post-present. For instance: 
(268) 
[Margaret Daley rose and spoke to him, requesting a confessional hearing at one of the appropriate times. ... 
Father Richards took her gently by the arm and spoke quietly into her ear.] “If it will help, my child, come 
now! [Let Christ, through His cross and through His resurrection, set you free from all your sins!”]  (WTW) 
Here If it will help, my child, come now! is equivalent to ‘If it will help if you come, my child, come now!’. If 
it will help thus functions not only as (part of the) P-clause depending on come now! but also as Q-clause for 
the implicit P-clause if you come. In other words, the logical form of this conditional is ‘If P2 (=[if P1, Q1]), 
(then) Q2’. The fact that the overt P-clause is to be understood as Q1 explains the use of the Future 
Perspective System in If it will help. 
Similar examples: 
(269) 
a. 
If it will make any difference to you, I will change my attitude towards her.  (=I will change my attitude 
towards her if it will make any difference to you if I do that.) 
 
 
b. 
I will give her a loan only if that will solve all her problems. 
 
 
c. 
I will come if my presence will be of any use to you.  (The P-clause ‘If I come’ is implicit in the NP ‘my 
presence’. Thus, the sentence means: ‘I will come if, if I come, my presence will be of any use to you.’) 
 
 
d. 
If it will make you feel less worried, I’ll warn the police. 
 
 
e. 
I can lend you a couple of quid, if that’ll help. 
 
 
f. 
[Your child won’t be the only shy one in the class but] do discuss it with the school if it’ll make you 
feel more relaxed.  (COB-W) 
 
 
g. 
Tottenham’s beleaguered team manager Peter Shreeves is willing to share his job with Terry Venables 
if it will save him from the sack.  (COB-W) 
If such sentences have a first person subject, as in (269a-e), they are paraphrasable as ‘I promise to do Q 
provided that I get the assurance that Q will entail P’. The Q-clause expresses a present decision concerning 
the post-present and the speaker says that the fulfilment of this decision depends on whether the addressee 
can confirm that some future situation will result if the decision is carried out. (If the confirmation is already 
given at the time of speech, P is a closed condition—see section 5.4.3 above; if the confirmation is presented 
as a quite possible or even expected future event, P is an open condition; otherwise it is a neutral condition.) 

As we have seen in connection with (268), it is typical of such examples that the superficial head clause 
and the superficial if-clause do not really form a conditional structure. In actual fact, the if-clause is the Q-
clause of an implicit P-clause, and this is the reason why it uses the Future Perspective System. Thus I’ll give 
you a loan if that’ll help means ‘I’ll give you a loan if [it will help if I give you a loan]’. In this case, the 
implicit if-clause is ‘hidden’ in the pronoun that—see section 11.9. 
The same (or a similar) type of conditional is illustrated by the following: 
(270) 
a. 
I was ready to answer any questions if I could bring the interview quickly and still ambiguously to an 
end.  (QUI). 
 
 
b. 
Come and see me at five, if that will suit you. 
The logical structure of (270a) is as in the previous examples. This is clear from the paraphrase ‘I was ready 
to answer any questions if [if I answered all the questions] I could bring the interview quickly and still 
ambiguously to an end.’ In (270b), the resumptive pronoun that again hides an implicit condition: ‘if it will 
suit you if you see me at five’ (i.e. ‘if five is a suitable time for you to see me’). The superficial if-clause thus 
again functions as a Q-clause, which explains the use of the FPS-form will suit. (This use of will does appear 
to involve genuine post-present time-reference. This becomes clear when we compare I’d like to see the 
doctor, if that {is / will be} possible with I’d like to see the doctor now, if that {is / ?will be} possible.) It is 
typical of such examples that the if-clause follows a break, as a kind of afterthought (postscript). 
The second exceptional case in which the Future Perspective System is found in an open P-clause 
referring to the post-present is when the P-clause forms part of a ‘relevance conditional’ (see section 10.1.1) 
and the Q-clause does not refer to the post-present. This is illustrated by the following examples (which are 
‘relevance conditionals’ because the P-clause each time specifies a condition under which it is relevant for 
the speaker to utter the Q-clause): 
(271) 
a. 
If you need me, I’ll be at Finster’s house.  (Eilfort 1987: 56) (The Q-clause refers to the post-present, 
hence the use of the Present Perspective System in the open P-clause.) 
 
 
b. 
If it’ll make you feel any better, we know now that it wasn’t your fault. (The Q-clause does not refer to 
the post-present, hence the need to use the Future Perspective System to express post-present time 
reference in the open P-clause.) 
The third exceptional case in which the Future Perspective System is found in an open P-clause referring to 
the post-present is when the P-clause occupies ‘postscript’ position (see sections 3.3 and 11.1), i.e. the P-
clause follows the Q-clause and is not fully syntactically integrated into it: it is added as a kind of 
afterthought. 
(272) 
a. 
I’d like—tonight—to drop in and see you. At ten? If you will be alone.  (Jacobsson 1984: 136) 
 
 
b. 
[It might be fun to go to the exhibition of great Victorian paintings at the Royal Academy this morning.] 
Afterwards we could go on as planned to the Courtauld Institute, if that won’t be a surfeit of painting.  
(Jacobsson 1984: 136-137) 
 
 
c. 
We have strong faith that a rally to the defence of the Act will be a feature of next year’s politics, if the 
Tory Party will have the courage to come into the open and declare war upon it.  (Jacobsson 1984: 137-
138) 
Apart from the three exceptions mentioned above, the Future Perspective System cannot normally be used in 
open P-clauses. Such examples as can occasionally be found sound archaic and are generally considered 
unacceptable in present-day standard English: 
(273) 
[Just as our primitive ancestor created a shapeless seat with crudely-cut branches, in the same way the last 
man on earth will look, amongst the debris of civilisation, for a stool on which to rest from his labours.] And 
if his spirit will remain free enough from the struggles of everyday life, he will devote his time to decorating 
his room.  (COB-W) 
In sum, the Present Perspective System is the normal tense system to be used in open-P clauses referring to 
the post-present. As regards this, it may be necessary to remind the hearer of the fact (pointed out in section 
5.1) that every one of the four tenses that can be used as absolute tenses can be used as ‘pseudo-absolute’ 
tenses in the Present Perspective System. This follows from the fact that a PPS-form in an open P-clause T-
relates the P-STO (=the time of the P-situation) to a post-present Q-STO which is treated as a ‘pseudo-t0’. 
The following examples illustrate the four possibilities: 

(274) 
a. 
The bomb will explode if you push this button.  (The P-STO is represented as T-simultaneous with the 
Q-STO, which is treated as if it were t0.) 
 
 
b. 
If you haven’t finished this by Saturday, you will be fired.  (The P-STO is located in the pseudo-pre-
present, i.e. in a period leading up to the pseudo-t0.) 
 
 
c. 
From next month onwards, workers will be fired if they didn’t pull their weight during the previous 
weeks.  (The P-STO is located in the pseudo-past.) 
 
 
d. 
[Over the next few weeks, the engineers will monitor the stress in the piers of the bridge and] they will 
close the bridge if it is going to give way under the weight of the traffic.  (The P-STO is located in the 
pseudo-post-present.) 
 
5.5.3. Open-P inferentials with a P-clause in the past tense 
 
As is clear from (274c) above, a past tense form in an open P-clause may be a PPS-form. Apart from this (i.e. 
when the reference is to the real past rather than the pseudo-past), a past tense form in an open P-clause can 
be used to express either a present conclusion about some past situation or a past conclusion. The latter 
interpretation occurs in FIS or PR=AST. Compare: 
(275) 
a. 
If, as I consider quite possible, he was with Joan last Sunday, he {was / must have been} with her on 
Monday too.  (present conclusion) 
 
 
b. 
If, as I considered quite possible, he was with Joan that Sunday, then he {had been / must have been} 
with her on the previous Sunday too.  (FIS: conclusion arrived at in the past) 
 
5.5.4. Open-P inferentials with a P-clause in the past perfect 
 
The P-clause of an open-P inferential can use the past perfect to locate the P-situation as T-anterior to a past 
TO (=time of orientation). In that case the tense in the Q-clause depends on whether the inference is 
represented as a present or past conclusion. Compare: 
(276) 
a. 
If he had seen Joan every day for the previous three weeks, then he {must have seen / saw} her that day 
too.  (direct speech: present conclusion) (‘If’ is to be read as ‘if, as I consider quite possible,’) 
 
 
b. 
If he had seen Joan every day for the previous three weeks, then he {must have seen / had seen} her that 
day too.  (FIS version of the previous example) 
 
 
c. 
If he had seen Joan every day for the previous three weeks, then he {had to have seen / had seen} her 
that day too.  (direct speech: past conclusion) (‘If’ is to be read as ‘if, as I considered quite possible,’) 
Similarly: 
(277) 
a. 
[He may have lost his wallet before or after he left town.] If he had already lost it before he left, he 
{must have stolen / stole} the money he needed to buy petrol.  (=This is my conclusion.) 
 
 
b. 
[He may or may not have lost his wallet]. If he had lost it before he left, he {had to have stolen / had 
stolen} the money he needed to buy petrol.  (=This was my conclusion.) 
 
5.5.5. Open-P inferentials with a P-clause in the past perfect and a Q-clause in the conditional perfect 
 
There is also a FIS or PR=AST reading if the open P-clause is in the past perfect (for anteriority) and the Q-
clause uses the conditional perfect (expressing past predictability): 
(278) 
If, as I thought possible, she had been on deck at the time of the murder, she would have seen what was 
happening.  (past conclusion: FIS or PR=AST) 
The same is true if the Q-clause uses epistemic might or could: 
(279) 
If, as I thought possible, she had been on deck at the time of the murder, she {could / might} have seen what 
was happening. 
As will be explained in section 7.3.1, the two above examples are open conditionals which, in FIS or 
PR=AST, have been “backshifted” (Jespersen 1932: 151). They do not have a counterfactual meaning, in 
spite of the fact that they are (i.e. have the form of) pattern 3 conditionals. 
 
5.5.6. Open P-clause combining with a tentative Q-clause 
 

In the following examples, an open P-clause that is ‘purely case-specifying’ and which uses the Present 
Perspective System to refer to the post-present is combined with a Q-clause expressing a tentative Q: 
(280) 
a. 
[Reports were made by the CPRE Executive member and by three Branches. On local government 
reorganisation. It was thought that Forest Health needs Newmarket and as Forest Health is in Suffolk 
there will be no change.] Only if Suffolk is split into east and West would one consider putting Forest 
Health into Cambridgeshire.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
And specially if an house comes up in six months it’d be nice to have something to one side.  (COB-S) 
This kind of combination is quite common with tentative nonepistemic could (expressing ability) in the Q-
clause: 
(281) 
If you have enough money, you could treat yourself to a new pair of shoes that don’t let in quite so much 
water.  (COB-W) 
A purely case-specifying open P-clause referring to the present, pre-present or past (rather than the post-
present) cannot similarly combine with a tentative Q-clause, unless the latter uses epistemic could or might: 
(282) 
a. 
[I don’t know if the climbers are at the hut now, but] if they’re not, they {could / might / *would} be in 
trouble. 
 
 
b. 
[I don’t know if the climbers have reached the hut yet, but] if they haven’t they {could / might / 
*would} be in trouble now. 
 
 
c. 
[I don’t know if the climbers reached the hut in time, but] if they didn’t they {could / might / *would} 
be in trouble now. 
However, would is possible if the syntactic Q-clause is only added as a hedge to what we might call the 
‘content’ Q-clause: 
(283) 
[I don’t know if the climbers have reached the hut yet, but] if they haven’t, I would say they {could / might / 
*would} be in trouble now. 
In open-P inferential conditionals, the Q-clause may sometimes use would instead of will (expressing 
predictability), and would have (sometimes would) instead of will have. This ‘backshifting’ renders the Q-
prediction more tentative (without, however, resulting in a tentative-P or counterfactual-P conditional): 
(284) 
a. 
If, as is possible, the team won yesterday, that {will have been / would be / would have been} their sixth 
win in a row. 
 
 
b. 
[It’s possible that he had an accident.] If so, he {won’t / wouldn’t} have been able to ring. 
Notice, finally, that sentences like the following do not illustrate the possibility of combining an open P-
clause using the Present Perspective System with a tentative Q-clause: 
(285) 
However, if federal funds are used, it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be 
obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment.  (BR) 
This is an example of what we will call an ‘implicit-P conditional’, i.e. a conditional whose P-clause is not 
overtly expressed as an if-clause but is implicit in a nominal (in this case: an infinitival clause)—see section 
11.9. Thus, (285) is interpreted as ‘However, if federal funds are used, it would be entirely appropriate if 
workers were trained for jobs which...’—see also Athanasiadou & Dirven (1997: 75). The example is 
interesting, however, in that it shows that a type 1 open P-clause can be added to a type 2 tentative-P 
conditional as a whole. 
 
5.5.7. Open P-clause combining with a counterfactual Q-clause 
 
In the following example, a P-clause expressing an open condition about the past is combined with a 
counterfactual Q-clause: 
(286) 
[If she had carried on living, I think she would be OK now. Certainly,] if she was suffering from depression 
she could have been cured. [But, confusingly, not all suicides are depressives. Some, I believe are just very, 
very unhappy.]  (COB-W) 
Here the Q-clause is understood as relating to a covert P-clause (such as if she had been treated for 
depression). This illustrates how an open P-clause referring to the past can be added to a counterfactual 
conditional (with covert P-clause) referring to the past. 

 
5.5.8. Open P-clause with the ‘futurate’ present tense 
 
As is well-known, an independent clause may use a nonprogressive present tense form instead of an FPS-
form to express that the post-present situation is seen as completely predetermined, and hence as inevitable. 
An example of this is The fair opens next Sunday. The progressive present tense can be used similarly to 
refer to an ‘arranged future’: We’re leaving tomorrow. Both uses of the present tense are often called 
‘futurate’.23 In the theory set out in section 5.1, they represent a ‘shift of temporal perspective’: in order to 
trigger a particular interpretation, the post-present is represented as if it were the present. The same uses of 
the present tense are possible in the Q-clause of an open-P conditional: 
(287) 
a. 
If I catch you doing that again, you’re done for.  (The present tense in the Q-clause renders the threat 
more forceful, as its fulfilment [if the P-situation actualizes] is guaranteed at the time of speech.) 
 
 
b. 
If you do that again, I’m leaving. 
 
 
c. 
If you don’t give me the money, you’re a dead man. 
There is a similar use of the present perfect (instead of the future perfect) in Q-clauses whose contents are 
represented as absolute certain if the P-condition is fulfilled: 
(288) 
If he doesn’t move his queen now, he’s lost the game. 
In IRS, FIS and PR=AST, examples can be found in which present tense forms such as those in the Q-
clauses of (287a-c) are “backshifted” (Jespersen 1932: 151) to past tense forms: 
(289) 
a. 
I (knew that) if he caught me doing it again, I was done for. 
 
 
b. 
If the prow should dash against the stone wall, they were all lost.  (COB-W) 
It should be noted, however, that the construction with the present tense in the Q-clause cannot always be 
transposed into the past in FIS or PR=AST. Compare the sentences in the following sets of examples: 
(290) 
a. 
If you don’t do your homework at once, you lose your pocket money.  (The reference may be to a 
permanent habit or to a single occasion. On the latter reading, the sentence expresses a threat 
concerning the result of a single action.) 
 
 
b. 
He said that if I didn’t do my homework at once, I lost my pocket money.  (IRS) (id.) 
 
 
c. 
If I didn’t do my homework at once, I lost my pocket money.  (Only the habitual reading is available: 
this is a description of a repeated result from a repeated action.) 
(291) 
a. 
If you don’t do your homework, you’re gated.  (habitual or semelfactive [=reference to one occasion]) 
 
 
b. 
If I didn’t do my homework, I was gated.  (habitual) 
Clearly, there is a correlation between a nonhabitual reading and an interpretation in terms of a threat. In 
(290a) and (291a), where the subject is you, the conditional is a direct speech threat if the reference is to a 
single (specific) occasion. In (290b) it may be a reported threat. In (290c) and (291b) there is no reference to 
a specific occasion and no idea of the speaker threatening the addressee. 
 
5.5.9. Open P-clause using the Present Perspective System and combining with a factual Q-clause? 
 
In the following examples an open P-clause using a PPS-form would seem to combine with a factual Q-
clause: 
(292) 
a. 
If there is an invasion, our troops are ready. 
 
 
b. 
If there’s an accident, or if someone gets ill, we have an emergency scheme. 
 
 
c. 
If the water rises still further tonight, there is an evacuation plan. 
However, (292a-c) are examples of ‘pseudo-Q conditionals’, i.e. conditionals in which the ‘If P, Q’ relation 
is not between the P-clause and the overt Q-clause, but between the P-clause and a covert Q-clause (see 
sections 3.12 and 11.7.2.10). Thus, (292a) is interpreted as something like ‘If there is an invasion, we will 
ward it off because our troops are ready’. Similarly, (292b-c) can be read, respectively, as ‘If there’s an 
accident, or if someone gets ill, this will not present a problem because we have an emergency scheme’ and 
‘If the water rises still further tonight, no one will get into real trouble because there is an evacuation plan’. 
                                              
23 Dancygier (1988b: 123) uses “futurate conditional” in a quite different sense, viz. that of our ‘open-P conditional’. 

(The covert Q-clauses can, of course, be slightly different, e.g. we can deal with it, but this is of no further 
relevance.) 
As noted in section 3.12, pseudo-Q conditionals like (292a-c) are always interpreted as purely case-
specifying-P conditionals rather than as inferentials or actualization conditionals. 
 
5.5.10. Open P-clauses with shall 
 
Poutsma (1926: 189) notes that in an open-P conditional of pattern 2 shall can be used in the if-clause “in the 
higher literary style”: 
(293) 
The author will indeed be glad if the book shall contribute in any degree to the solution of the many 
problems of statecraft that must be settled satisfactorily... 
This use of shall is now obsolete. 
 
5.6. The use of tenses in tentative-P conditionals 
 
5.6.1. Introduction 
 
In tentative-P conditionals, P expresses a pure hypothesis which is seen as rather remote from the actual 
world. In most cases, the theoretical P-world is assumed to be such that it might correspond with the actual 
world, but this possibility is considered rather unlikely (but not impossible) to be (or to have been or to 
come) true. 
 
5.6.2. Time reference in tentative-P conditionals 
 
In a tentative-P conditional, the P-situation is normally located in the (distant or immediate) post-present. 
However, it is not impossible for the P-clause to refer to the present, pre-present or past: 
(294) 
a. 
I’d be glad if she left tomorrow.  (reference to the post-present) 
 
 
b. 
[“I wonder if this is true.”] — “Well, even if it was, I would be the last one to know.”  (reference to the 
present) 
 
 
c. 
[I doubt if he has ever had any money. But, of course,] even if he had, we wouldn’t {be / have been} the 
ones to know about it.  (reference to the pre-present) 
 
 
d. 
[I doubt if he had any money at the time. But, of course,] even if he {did / had had}, we wouldn’t {be / 
have been} the ones to know about it.  (reference to past) 
In (294b-d), the tentative meaning of the P-clause results from lack of knowledge on the part of the speaker. 
However, the speaker assumes that the chances of actualization of the P-situation are small. 
Tentative-P conditionals also refer to the present if they express an eternal truth or a generalization over a 
period including past, present and future: 
(295) 
[They always talk about their parents in a way] that would deeply hurt them if they overheard it. 
When the P-situation is located in the post-present, the Q-situation may be temporally located anywhere: 
(296) 
a. 
If she came tomorrow, I would be happy.  (post-present Q-situation) 
 
 
b. 
If she was going to London tomorrow, she would already have bought her ticket.  (pre-present Q-
situation; counterfactual reading also possible) 
 
 
c. 
[Suppose he were competing in the ‘Iron Man’ triathlon next month.] He would no doubt be training 
very hard now.  (present Q-situation: the reply to this could be: “Yes, you’re right. So there is a chance 
that we might find him at his parents’ in Hastings. He usually goes there when he prepares for a major 
competition.”) (Note also that the subjunctive form ‘were’ is an alternative to ‘was’—see section 6.1.2.) 
 
 
d. 
[I told him that] if she came tomorrow, I would be happy <at the time of her coming>.  (The Q-situation 
is posterior to the situation referred to by ‘said’, which establishes a past temporal domain.) 
 
5.6.3. Tentative P-world treated as a past domain 
 
The fact that the hypothesis is seen as rather remote from the actual world has consequences for the use of 
the verb forms in the P-clause and the Q-clause. To signal its remoteness from reality, the tentative 

theoretical world (intensional domain) is represented as if it were a past temporal domain. Since both the P-
situation and the Q-situation belong to this world, the two clauses must normally involve past time-sphere 
tenses. It follows that there are no longer many possible combinations of tense forms, as is the case in closed-
P and open-P conditionals. Tentative-P conditionals can as a rule only make use of tenses that are otherwise 
used to express T-relations in a past temporal domain. If the P-STO is to be understood as W-posterior to a 
past TO, the P-clause must make use of the past counterpart of the Present Perspective System. This means 
that the past tense has to be used instead of the conditional tense: 
(297) 
The economic situation would soon look up if the political crisis {came / *would come} to an end. 
In this case came expresses T-simultaneity, while the interpretation is in terms of W-posteriority (treated here 
as ‘sloppy W-simultaneity’—see section 5.1.8). When the tentative-P conditional involves still other clauses, 
they will also use the past tense to express T-simultaneity. 
(298) 
a. 
If Bill found the answer, he would tell me at once what it was. 
 
 
b. 
[If it was something like cancer or multiple sclerosis I’d want to fight on to the end.] But, if it got to the 
point where I was so ill I was waiting to die, then I would ask for euthanasia.  (COB-W) 
Depending on the temporal relation expressed, such a subordinate clause can also use the past perfect (for T-
anteriority) or the conditional tense (for T-posteriority): 
(299) 
If we sold these at that price, people would think that we had stolen them, or that they would break after a 
couple of days. 
However, examples can be found in which the Q-clause does not use a tense form typical of a past domain. 
In that case the shift of temporal focus to a nonpast sector signals that Q should not be interpreted in terms of 
the tentative P-domain but in terms of the actual world—see also section 5.6.9 below: 
(300) 
If I were going to take up my brother’s offer of a holiday with him, there are a lot of things I would have to 
see to first. 
This shift of the domain to the present can also occur in a clause depending on the Q-clause: 
(301) 
a. 
If she gave me the tickets, I’d go to the play she wanted me to go to.  (Sweetser 1996: 326) (=I’d go to 
whatever play she might like) 
 
 
b. 
If she gave me the tickets, I’d go to the play she wants me to go to.  (Sweetser 1996: 326) (implies that 
there is such a specific play in the actual world) 
 
5.6.4. Canonical pattern 2 conditionals 
 
The prototypical tentative-P conditional is the canonical tense pattern 2 conditional, in which the P-clause 
uses the past tense and the Q-clause the conditional tense: If she came, I would be happy. Variants are: 
(a) tentative-P conditionals using the subjunctive form were instead of was in the P-clause—see section 
6.1.2: 
(302) 
It wouldn’t be good for the country’s economy if that man {was / were} elected president. 
(b) tentative-P conditionals whose P-clause uses modal nondeontic should, as in the following example—see 
section 6.4.2: 
(303) 
If the changes caused by the Greenhouse Effect should turn out to be as serious as many people think, 
emissions of all Greenhouse gases would have to be minimised.  (COB-W) 
(c) tentative-P conditionals expressing T-anteriority—see section 5.6.2: 
(304) 
a. 
If he had hidden the money before we found him, where would he have put it? 
 
 
b. 
[The cost of putting a foreign-currency cheque from an Australian granny into your account can range 
from a discretionary no-charge to £80.] If granny had chosen to transfer the money electronically, you 
would generally still have to pay a charge to receive the sum, [in addition to what she paid to send it.]  
(COB-W) 
(d) conditionals whose Q-clause uses could or might (to add the idea of ability or epistemic possibility): 
(305) 
a. 
If you moved over a bit, I could sit down. 
 
 
b. 
If the enemy attacked, the bridge {might / could} be blown up. 

(e) conditionals whose Q-clause uses epistemic should or ought to: 
(306) 
If we started off at once we {ought to / should} be back in time for lunch. 
If we find a combination of verb forms other than the ones described above, we can normally—see section 
5.6.8 for an exception—draw one of the following conclusions: 
(a) The conditional is not a tentative-P one. 
(b) The conditional utterance represents a performance ‘error’, as in the following examples: 
(307) 
a. 
[David likes women—he respects them. He likes having women work for him. He’d say to me,] “If I 
had two people in front of me, and one of them is a man and one is a woman, I’ll hire the woman, 
[because I know the woman will work her heart out to prove herself.”]  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
If you said to me today, “I, in my infinite wisdom, can guarantee you’ll be President ...” I’ll say to you, 
“Look, David, I don’t want the job that much.”  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
If Mr Alexander can demonstrate the ability to win, then the consequence of Mr Buchanan’s ultra-
conservative strength would be to produce a moderate as the final victor.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
Even if we join a single currency at an acceptable rate ..., we would need to devalue to prevent massive 
unemployment.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
[Meanwhile Heracles boasts that] Deianeira will be able to claim Zeus, god of gods, for her father-in-
law if she were to marry him.  (COB-W) 
 
 
f. 
If they can come up with what I’m after, I would stay.  (COB-W) 
 
 
g. 
If you had moved jobs during your working life and were not making any pension contributions (for 
example you did not have a personal pension or were not a member of your employer’s scheme), then 
these gaps will lead to a shortfall in your pension.  (COB-W) 
Such production ‘errors’ often result from a speaker’s mid-utterance change of mind about how to present 
the material. In (307a), for example, David starts with a remote hypothetical case and then switches to 
predictability, which is much more about his here-and-now convictions. 
(c) The third exception (to the use of tenses described above) is when the initial P-clause does not form part 
of the same conditional as the clause that is seemingly its Q-clause. This is sometimes the case when the real 
protasis (=P-clause) of an inferential conditional is not overtly expressed: 
(308) 
If he is such a good lawyer, I would hire him. 
This is interpreted as ‘If he is such a good lawyer, I would hire him {if I were you / if I needed a lawyer / 
etc.}’. This paraphrase makes clear that it is the ‘covert’ if-clause—see section 11.7.1—that is the P-clause in 
the tentative theoretical P-world. The first if-clause expresses a closed or open condition restricting the 
validity of the tentative-P conditional. Similarly, in the following examples the P-clause uses would because 
it actually functions as the Q-clause of another (explicit or covert) P-clause: 
(309) 
If you would be able to open my safe (if you {tried / wanted to / had the right instruments...}), it is time I 
bought a better one. 
In this example the superficial Q-clause is not the Q-clause of the tentative-P conditional, so that it does not 
use would. Instead, the sequence If you would be able to open my safe (if you wanted to) functions as the P-
clause of a closed conditional—the speaker assumes it to be true—and as we have seen, any tense can be 
found in the Q-clause of a closed conditional. Similarly: 
(310) 
a. 
If a loan would have saved him, why didn’t you give him one?  (=If it would have saved him if you had 
given him a loan, why didn’t you give him one?) 
 
 
b. 
We may return Barclaycard Cheques unpaid if payment would result in the Credit Limit being 
exceeded.  (COB-W) (=We may return Barclaycard Cheques unpaid if it would result in the Credit 
Limit being exceeded if we paid them.) 
 
 
c. 
If John would be able to break the record (if he really tried), {we can certainly break it / we would be 
able to break it too / we could have broken it a long time ago}. 
 
 
d. 
Why, she wanted to ask, if it wouldn’t have sounded horribly rude.  (NW) 
This use of would is also possible in postscript P-clauses which themselves contain an (overt or implicit) 
condition. (We have discussed a similar use of will in section 5.5.2.) In the following example, the tentative-
P construction is used for politeness rather than to represent the actualization of the situations as unlikely: 
(311) 
I could lend you my car, if that would help.  (=...if it would help if I lent you my car) 

Sometimes both will and would can be used. They represent the postscript if-clause as the Q-clause of an 
open-P or tentative-P conditional (with an implicit P-clause), respectively: 
(312) 
I’ll collect them tonight—if that {will / would} suit you. 
 
5.6.5. The conditional tense expressing T-posteriority in the Q-clause 
 
The combination of a preterite form in the P-clause and (nonvolitional) would in the Q-clause normally leads 
to a tentative or counterfactual interpretation. However, in IRS, FIS and PR=AST, the conditional tense in 
the Q-clause may simply express T-posteriority in a past domain. In that case we have a ‘backshifted’ open-P 
conditional, i.e. an open-P conditional presented from a past point of view: 
(313) 
a. 
[He said that] he would do it the next day, if he had time. 
 
 
b. 
[She had made up her mind.] If a suitable occasion arose, she would lure him away from the farm and 
shoot him. 
 
5.6.6. Past counterpart of the Present Perspective System in the P-clause 
 
In the same way as the P-clause of an open conditional referring to the post-present has to use the Present 
Perspective System (present tense, present perfect or is going to+infinitive) rather than the Future 
Perspective System (future tense, future perfect or will be going to + infinitive), the P-clause of a tentative-P 
conditional referring to a time that is W-posterior to a past time of orientation has to use the past tense, the 
past perfect or ‘was going to+infinitive’ rather than the conditional tense, the conditional perfect or ‘would 
be going to+infinitive’, respectively: 
(314) 
a. 
[I don’t think] she wouldn’t buy a car if she {went / *would go} to live in the city. 
 
 
b. 
Perhaps she wouldn’t buy a car if it {had had / *would have had} several previous owners. 
 
 
c. 
She wouldn’t buy a car if she {was / *would be} going to move to the city. 
In section 5.5.2, this use of tense forms was explained as follows. The temporal domain established by a Q-
clause referring to the post-present functions as an intensional domain. In open-P conditionals referring to the 
post-present, this intensional domain coincides with the intensional domain evoked by the P-clause. It 
follows that the P-clause-STO (=the time of the predicated P-situation) must be located in the temporal Q-
domain, i.e. that the P-clause must represent its STO as temporally subordinated to the Q-clause-STO. In 
open-P conditionals, temporal subordination is thus the linguistic means of expressing a logical connection 
between P and Q, such as cause and effect, or premise and conclusion. The temporal relation in question 
(between the P-clause-STO and the Q-clause-STO) may be that of T-simultaneity, as in (314a), T-anteriority, 
as in (314b) or T-posteriority, as in (314c). In the latter case there is usually a ‘prospective’ connotation, so 
that only an auxiliary like be going to or be about to can be used: 
(315) 
Wouldn’t the police intervene if the protesters {were about to / *would} march to the U.S. Embassy? 
However, if there is no prospective meaning, would can be used to express T-posteriority in the P-clause: 
(316) 
[Put the pregnant women in the middle of a flock of wrens. The baby would be a boy if they flew away in 
terror, because white boys stalked and tortured and killed them.] If it would be a girl, they’d cluster around 
singing, [because girls ground grain and scattered some for the wrens.]  (Jacobsson 1984: 140) 
 
5.6.7. Past counterpart of the Future Perspective System in the P-clause 
 
In section 5.5.2 we saw that the P-clause of an open-P conditional referring to the post-present normally has 
to use the Present Perspective System. The only systematic exceptions to this rule are (a) when the P-clause 
is actually the Q-clause of an (explicit or implicit) open P-clause, (b) when the P-clause forms part of a 
‘relevance conditional’ whose Q-clause does not refer to the post-present, and (c) when the open P-clause is 
used as a ‘postscript’. In these three cases a P-clause referring to the post-present uses the Future Perspective 
System. The first and third of these exceptions also apply to tentative P-clauses referring to the post-present. 
(Relevance conditionals are out because they are never tentative.) For example: 
(317) 
a. 
I wouldn’t do it if it would be upsetting to you (if I did it). 

 
 
b. 
[A behind-the-scenes struggle is now going on over a possible compromise with Mr. Heath, on the basis 
of a backbencher’s amendment] which would enable price maintenance to continue for certain goods “if 
the public as purchasers, consumers, or users of any goods” would be harmed if it were abolished.  
(Haegeman 1983: 158) 
 
 
c. 
I’d like to see you later tonight—if you would be alone. 
An interesting observation about examples like the first two is that they do not share the restrictions on 
possible combinations of tense forms which we observe in a normal pattern 2 conditional (where the Q-
clause as a rule uses would and the P-clause uses the past tense or the subjunctive form were). When the 
overt P-clause is the Q-clause of another P-clause, there are no such restrictions on the use of verb forms in 
the overt P-clause and the overt Q-clause. This appears from examples like the following: 
(318) 
a. 
If JOHN would be able to break the record (if he really tried), we {can certainly break it / would be able 
to break it too / could have broken it a long time ago}. 
 
 
b. 
But if loss of the final consonant would result in confusion between the present and past forms of the 
verb, it is retained.  (Jacobsson 1984:142) 
This means that the combination of the overt P-clause and the embedded (or implied) P-clause is a self-
contained whole (i.e. a conditional of its own) and that the usual close logical relation between the overt P-
clause and the overt Q-clause is absent here. Put in other words: the STOs of the overt P-clause and the 
embedded or implicit P-clause belong to the same temporal (and intensional) domain, but the STO of the 
overt Q-clause does not form part of it: it establishes a domain of its own. 
 
5.6.8. Tentative P-clauses combining with a factual Q-clause 
 
In direct speech, a tentative P-clause may sometimes combine with a factual Q-clause referring to the 
present: 
(319) 
a. 
[Wherever you are, you can rely on American Express. The Card is widely accepted worldwide, 
offering you convenient spending power and reassuring security.] If it were ever lost or stolen, your 
Card can usually be replaced within 24 hours—[the invaluable peace of mind you need when you’re 
travelling.]  (COB-W) (tentative P + factual Q) 
 
 
b. 
They can’t go back to Nigeria even if they wanted to, [because everyone back there knows what 
they’ve been doing here.]  (The Bulletin) (factual Q + tentative P) 
 
 
c. 
He also has an ‘escape’ clause in his contract with Middlesbrough, if he were to be offered the post of 
England coach.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
If I were to hazard a guess I think it’s very likely he will be the country’s next president.  (COB-W) 
There seem to be a variety of reasons for combining a tentative P-clause with a factual Q-clause, and 
sometimes there is a choice about whether or not to use a factual Q-clause, whereas sometimes, as in (319c), 
there is not. It would be possible to rewrite (319a) as follows: 
 
(i) 
If it is ever lost or stolen, your Card can usually be replaced within 24 hours. 
 
(ii) If it were ever lost or stolen, we would usually be able to replace your Card within 24 hours. 
However, while the company does not want to give a negative message that it is quite possible that the card 
will be lost or stolen, with the result that that possibility is treated as remote, the company wants to be as 
positive as possible about their ability to replace a card quickly, so this ability is treated as factual rather than 
as part of the tentative intensional world set up by P. Similarly, (319b) could be rewritten They couldn’t go 
back to Nigeria even if they wanted to, but this would place the inability to return in a nonfactual word, 
which, although it does not rule out the same inability applying in the factual world, weakens the speaker’s 
message about the real plight of the people referred to. Sentence (319c) cannot be similarly rewritten, but this 
is due to the fact that it is a ‘pseudo-Q conditional’, i.e. the real Q-clause is missing. The apparent Q cannot 
be seen as referring to a situation which can be located in the P-world. Sentence (319d), however, can be 
rewritten If I were to hazard a guess, I would think it’s very likely that he would be the country’s next 
president. 
The following sentences illustrate a similar combination of a tentative P-clause and a factual Q-clause 
referring to the past or pre-present. (In section 10.1.6 it will be noted that examples like [320a] are 
‘commenting-Q conditionals’, because the Q-clause expresses a comment on the P-proposition. Sentences 
[320b-d] are purely case-specifying-P conditionals. A tentative-P clause can apparently not combine with a 
factual Q-clause in an inferential or actualization conditional.) 

(320) 
a. 
(referring to the discovery of evidence of life in rock samples from Mars)  [“Is this all just a NASA 
stunt, to stimulate public interest in space exploration?”] — “Well, if it WERE a NASA stunt, it’s been 
extremely successful.”  (BBC World Service) (tentative P + factual Q) 
 
 
b. 
[“Why on earth would they want a baby like Bella?” There came no answer, but Izzy thought she knew. 
Judi had told her, igniting a bonfire of fears. White flesh. The ultimate status symbol. To be raised in 
the traditional way.] And even if it were for some other reason, it scarcely mattered. [They had sold her 
baby.]  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[It felt like I was trapped by the club and my only way out was to go and play in Europe. I am delighted 
with the West Brom move because] I always wanted to stay in this country if it were possible.  (COB-
W) 
 
 
d. 
He was capable of walking great distances if he were put to it and was in condition.  (Jespersen 1932: 
132) 
In all these sentences, was could be used instead of the subjunctive were, but then the P-clause would be 
interpreted as expressing an open condition. (The use of the past tense would be the result of past time 
reference, not of a tentative meaning.) The use of were changes the meaning from ‘open’ to ‘tentative’. 
These examples again illustrate that the subjunctive were (which is generally available as an alternative to 
was in tentative P-clauses) is only possible in contexts which are compatible with a tentative reading of P. 
For example, Jespersen (1932: 133) points out that were cannot replace the past tense in (what we call) 
closed-P and open-P conditionals and illustrates this with the following examples: 
(321) 
a. 
If there {was / *were} one person he positively hated, it was Nigel. 
 
 
b. 
If it {was / *were} a light answer, I beg you for forgiveness. 
 
5.6.9. Pattern 1 conditionals with a tentative-P meaning 
 
Apart from pattern 2 tentative-P conditionals, a pattern 1 conditional may also (but exceptionally) refer to a 
highly unlikely world. This is the case in some pattern 1 conditionals of the ‘ad absurdum’ type. Compare: 
(322) 
a. 
Pigs will fly if she manages to do that. 
 
 
b. 
I’ll eat my hat if England wins tomorrow.  (Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 1978: 518) 
These two conditionals are interpreted as counterfactual and unlikely, respectively. The condition is 
ostensibly presented as an open one (viz. as a condition which may or may not actualize in the post-present), 
but once it is seen that the speaker treats Q, and therefore P, as impossible or highly unlikely, it is 
pragmatically clear that the condition is to be interpreted as either counterfactual, as in (322a), or as 
‘expected to prove counterfactual’, i.e. as highly unlikely, as in (322b). (There is an intuitive difference 
between the counterfactuality of If you’ve got an Olympic medal, I’m the tooth fairy and the counterfactuality 
of If you had won an Olympic medal, you would have got lottery funding for the next four years. However, 
there can be no doubt that ad absurdum conditionals are counterfactual in some sense and should therefore be 
classified as a type of counterfactual.) 
 
5.7. The use of tenses in counterfactual-P conditionals 
 
5.7.1. Introduction 
 
In this type, the theoretical P-world is assumed to be not only incompatible with the actual world but also 
contrary to it. Because of this maximal remoteness from reality, the theoretical world is again treated as a 
past intensional and temporal domain, in which both the P-situation and the Q-situation are located. (This 
means that subclauses that are temporally subordinated to the P-clause or Q-clause will also be treated as 
belonging to a past domain. Thus, in the following example the past tense form were having is used to 
express T-simultaneity with the Q-STO, although the latter is interpreted as lying in the present: If we hadn’t 
missed the tram, we wouldn’t be waiting here while the others were already having dinner.) 
The prototypical counterfactual-P conditional is the canonical pattern 3 conditional, illustrated by If she 
had come, I {would / should} have spoken to her. (A variant of this is If she had come, I {might / could} have 
spoken to her.) However, pattern 2 conditionals whose P-clause refers to the present are also counterfactual: 
If I knew anything about it, I would tell you. 
 

5.7.2. Time reference in counterfactual pattern 3 conditionals 
 
The unmarked interpretation of a counterfactual-P pattern 3 conditional is that both clauses refer to the past: 
If you had done that, I would have punished you. In fact, a great many linguists and philosophers have 
claimed that counterfactual pattern 3 conditionals can only refer to the past. The most recent proponents of 
this claim are Athanasiadou & Dirven (1996: 636) and Iatridou (2000: 233-234). Others (e.g. Han [1996: 
124]) claim that there are only past and present counterfactuals. However, there is no doubt that post-present 
situations too can (under certain conditions) be represented as counterfactual by a pattern 3 conditional. 
Moreover, such a conditional can even locate the P-situation and the Q-situation at different times. Compare: 
(323) 
a. 
If she had been here {yesterday / since yesterday / now}, I would have been happy. 
 
 
b. 
If you had come tomorrow instead of today, you wouldn’t have found me at home.  (post-present P-
situation + post-present Q-situation) 
 
 
c. 
If I hadn’t started out yesterday, I wouldn’t have been here now.  (past P-situation + present Q-
situation) 
 
 
d. 
If I hadn’t started out yesterday, I wouldn’t have reached my destination tomorrow.  (past P-situation + 
post-present Q-situation) 
 
 
e. 
If the Chinese government hadn’t turned this area into a nature reserve last year, the whole herd would 
have been dead within five years from now.  (BBC World Service) (past P-situation + post-present Q-
situation) 
 
 
f. 
If you had been an engineer, you would have known what is wrong with this engine.  (extended present 
P-situation + present Q-situation) (By ‘extended present’ we mean a period of time that includes not 
only the temporal zero-point but also some significant portion of the past and of the post-present.) 
 
 
g. 
If I hadn’t been in the country (now), I wouldn’t have been able to attend your wedding {yesterday / 
today / tomorrow}.  (extended present P-situation + past / present / post-present Q-situation) 
However, there appear to be constraints on the possibility of interpreting the Q-clause of a counterfactual-P 
pattern 3 conditional as referring to the present or post-present. There is usually no problem if the P-situation 
refers to a state holding for an indefinite period of time, i.e. a permanent state, characteristic or habit. In that 
case the P-situation can easily include the present and the post-present (as well as the past), so that any time 
reference is in principle possible in the Q-clause: 
(324) 
a. 
If you had been a carpenter, you could have mended these rolling-shutters {yesterday / today / 
tomorrow}. 
 
 
b. 
(uttered just before the addressee leaves)  If I hadn’t been ill, I should have joined you. 
 
 
c. 
[Saxton’s assertion that “the only garden sculptures worth having are genuine antiques” briskly 
dismisses Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. She says that] the misery she suffers when her plants 
are devastated by an attack of aphids “could hardly have been excelled if I had been diagnosed as HIV 
positive”.  (TLS) (The author wants to give a characterization of Saxton, but uses something she said 
about a single past event to do this, so there is a mixture of the present habitual ‘the misery she suffers 
when her plants are devastated’ and what is probably her description of the misery suffered when the 
plants WERE devastated.) 
There are restrictions, however, if the permanent state, characteristic or habit that the P-clause refers to is 
inherently (necessarily) counterfactual for pragmatic reasons, as in counteridenticals (e.g. when the P-clause 
is if I had been you)—see 4.2.7.3. In that case the Q-clause can easily refer to the past or present, but only 
under certain conditions to the post-present: 
(325) 
a. 
If I had been you I should have tried long ago to do something about it.  (Q-clause referring to the past) 
 
 
b. 
If I’d been you I wouldn’t have come to this meeting.  (id.) 
 
 
c. 
If I’d been you, I wouldn’t have been here today.  (Q-clause referring to the present) 
 
 
d. 
*If I’d been you I wouldn’t have been here tomorrow. 
 
 
e. 
If I’d been you, I wouldn’t have done Paris tomorrow. [It would have been better to do it on a Sunday.] 
 
 
f. 
If I’d been you I wouldn’t have done that tomorrow.  (only acceptable in a schedule context, as in 
[325e]) 
Examples (325d-f) show that, in counteridentical-P conditionals, a pattern 3 counterfactual Q-clause can only 
refer to the post-present if there is a current and very fixed plan and we can refer to the past creation of that 
plan. Thus, in (325e) the idea ‘I’m going to go to Paris tomorrow’ would not be enough. What we need is 
‘The way I’ve scheduled things is that we visit Paris tomorrow.’ In fact, (325e) only becomes 100% 
felicitous when both the speaker and the addressee are considering a timetable. 

The reason why counterfactual P-clauses and counterfactual Q-clauses cannot freely refer to the post-
present is that the implied factual statements #P [=‘not P’] and #Q [=‘not Q’] concern the actual world. The 
actual world is described by propositions which are true at the moment of speech. This means that #P and #Q 
cannot be propositions about the post-present: a proposition about the post-present can be presented as 
neutral, closed, open or tentative, but not as factual (true at the moment of speech) or counterfactual (false at 
the moment of speech). What can be presented as factual, however, are propositions describing a present 
intention or arrangement concerning the post-present. Thus, I’m leaving tomorrow describes a present 
intention or arrangement to leave tomorrow. Although the actualization of the situation of leaving lies in the 
post-present (and is therefore neither factual nor counterfactual) the intention or arrangement is presented as 
a present fact. 
In sum, counterfactual P-clauses and Q-clauses cannot represent the post-present actualization of their 
situation as counterfactual. However, they can represent the present origin of a pre-determined post-present 
situation as counterfactual. It is only such counterfactual conditionals, in which #P and #Q are true in the 
actual world, that can ‘refer to the post-present’ in the sense that P and Q are propositions about post-present 
actualizations. In spite of appearances, such counterfactuals make a claim about the present (actual) world: 
the implied #P and #Q are true in the actual world, not in a nonfactual (i.e. theoretical) post-present world. It 
follows that it becomes predictable which counterfactual conditionals about post-present actualization are 
acceptable, and which are not. Consider: 
(326) 
a. 
If you had come tomorrow, you wouldn’t have found me at home.  (This is fine if the addressee’s 
coming is scheduled now to actualize at a time other than tomorrow. In that case, #P [‘You will not 
come tomorrow’] is true.) 
 
 
b. 
If you had come tomorrow instead of today, you wouldn’t have found me at home.  (This is fine 
because ‘You have come today’ expresses a present fact and ‘instead of’ leaves no room for the 
addressee’s coming at another time, such as tomorrow. The idea of coming tomorrow is thus excluded 
in the present.) 
 
 
c. 
If I hadn’t started out yesterday, I wouldn’t have reached my destination tomorrow.  (This is fine 
because #Q [‘I will reach my destination tomorrow’] is presented, by implication, as being determined 
by #P [‘I started out yesterday’], which is a fact in the [present] actual world.) 
 
 
d. 
If the Chinese government hadn’t turned this area into a nature reserve last year, the whole herd would 
have been dead within five years from now.  (BBC World Service) (Here too, #Q [‘The whole herd will 
not be dead within five years from now’] is implied to be determined by #P [‘The Chinese government 
turned this area into a nature reserve last year’], which is a fact in the actual world. The sentence is 
therefore impeccable.) 
 
 
e. 
If I hadn’t been in the country (now), I wouldn’t have been able to attend your wedding tomorrow.  
(fine because #P [‘I am in the country now’], which causes #Q [‘I will be able to attend your 
wedding’], is a present fact) 
 
 
f. 
*If I’d been you I wouldn’t have been here tomorrow.  (There is no causal relation between #P [‘I am 
not you’] and #Q [‘You will be here tomorrow’], and no idea of present scheduling. The sentence is 
unacceptable because there is no question of future Q-actualization depending on the present #P or on 
a present schedule.) 
 
 
g. 
If I’d been you I wouldn’t have done that tomorrow.  (This sentence is fine provided there is a present 
intention, plan or arrangement on the part of the addressee to ‘do that’ tomorrow.) 
 
 
h. 
If your late father had been here today, he would have been sitting in the front row.  (This is fine 
because #Q [‘He isn’t sitting in the front row’] is determined by #P [‘Your late father is not here 
today’], which is a fact in the actual world.) 
 
 
i. 
If your late father {had been attending / *had attended} your wedding tomorrow, he would have been 
very proud.  (‘Had been attending’ is fine because #Q is determined by #P, which describes a present 
negative intention or arrangement: ‘Your late father isn’t attending your wedding tomorrow’. The 
nonprogressive sentence ‘*Your late father doesn’t attend your wedding tomorrow’ cannot be used in 
this sense, which means that it cannot be the expression of the proposition #P which is true in the 
present.) 
 
 
j. 
If Queen Victoria had been watching this man walking on the moon now, she would have been amused.  
(This is fine because #Q is determined by #P [‘Victoria is not watching this man walking on the moon 
now’], which is a fact in the actual world.) 
In sum, counterfactual P-clauses may be ‘about’ the post-present only if there is a presently valid #P 
implying a post-present actualization. That #P may be a present intention, plan, programme, arrangement or 

agreement about the future or another proposition describing the actual world, like the expression of a 
permanent habit or other kind of state. The following examples further illustrate this: 
(327) 
a. 
If the end of the world {had been coming / ??had come} tomorrow, all this work would have been in 
vain.  (This sentence is fine if the speaker presupposes that the end of the world will not be coming 
tomorrow, in other words that #P is presently true; #P can be formulated as ‘The end of the world is 
not coming tomorrow’ but not as ‘*The end of the world does not come tomorrow’.) 
 
 
b. 
*If it had rained tomorrow afternoon, the match would have been cancelled.  (This sentence is 
unacceptable because it presupposes that #P [‘it will not rain tomorrow afternoon’] is presently true) 
(This runs counter to Woods [1997: 81], who claims the sentence is acceptable. In our opinion it is not, 
unless rain is seen as something that can be scheduled.) 
 
 
c. 
[“I just don’t fancy him, that’s all; and I could never love him—never. ... “ — “So you won’t be 
needing me any more—for the wedding,” said Morse slowly. — “Fraid not, no.] There wouldn’t have 
been a wedding anyway, though, would there—not if you’re going to arrest me?”  (DOC)  (The Q-
clause ‘There wouldn’t have been a wedding anyway’ implies a covert counterfactual P-clause ‘even I 
did love him’. The overt postscript P-clause ‘not if you’re going to arrest me’ reveals that it has already 
become clear that the post-present wedding is pragmatically impossible, i.e. that #Q [‘There won’t be a 
wedding’] is true in the actual world. The sentence is therefore impeccable.) 
 
 
d. 
If your uncle had paid us a surprise visit today instead of tomorrow, we would have been in trouble. 
(This is fine because #P [‘Your uncle {hasn’t paid / isn’t paying} us a visit today and thus will still be 
paying us a visit tomorrow’] is taken to be true.) 
 
 
e. 
If John had come tomorrow, he wouldn’t have found me at home.  (This is fine if #P [‘John will not 
come tomorrow’] is felt to be true now; this may be because John’s not-coming tomorrow is scheduled 
[by himself or somebody else], or because John’s coming at another time is scheduled and the speaker 
is not considering the possibility of John coming twice.) 
 
 
f. 
If you had gone there tomorrow you wouldn’t have found anyone at home.  (This only makes sense if 
the future visit has been ruled out prior to this sentence being uttered.) 
 
 
g. 
(speaking in the morning) [It’s lucky Bill’s not coming until next week.] If he’d come this afternoon, 
we’d’ve been embarrassed to let him see the place in this state.  (This sentence is fine because #P [‘Bill 
{will not / has not} come this afternoon’] is felt to be true now.) 
 
 
h. 
If John had been coming tomorrow instead of Sarah, I wouldn’t have answered the door.  (This sentence 
is fine if #P [‘John is not coming tomorrow instead of Sarah’] is interpreted as true in the present 
[actual] world. This is the case if it has been arranged for Sarah to come tomorrow and it is understood 
that John will not come if Sarah does.) 
 
 
i. 
If I’d been you, I wouldn’t have done that tomorrow.  (Since, in a ‘counteridentical’ like this, there is 
no causal relation between P and Q, what makes the sentence acceptable is not the fact that #P [‘I am 
not you’] is true but the fact that #Q [‘You will do that tomorrow’] is true. The proposition #Q can only 
be treated as true in the actual world if its situation depends on a present arrangement. So, the 
conditional is only acceptable if read as ‘If I’d been you, I wouldn’t have arranged to do that 
tomorrow’.) 
In sum, there are cases in which a counterfactual-P conditional of pattern 3 can refer to the present or post-
present rather than to the past. It is even possible for the two clauses to refer to different times—see also 
above: 
(328) 
If he had been able to remember his aunt’s address yesterday, he would have paid her a visit tomorrow. [But 
it’s too late now.] 
 
5.7.3. Time reference in counterfactual pattern 2 conditionals 
 
As will be noted in sections 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.2.3, in a pattern 2 conditional, P is by implicature interpreted as 
counterfactual if the P-situation is interpreted as located in the present: 
(329) 
a. 
If I knew the truth, I would tell you. 
 
 
b. 
If I {was / were} a rich man, I wouldn’t have to work. 
 
 
c. 
If I had a lot of money, I would not be doing this lousy work. 
 
 
d. 
It would be better if you were working hard on your dissertation. 
 
 
e. 
You would be spending less on petrol if you walked to work. 
As is clear from the examples, a P-clause in the past tense can only be interpreted as referring to the present 
(and hence as counterfactual) if the predicate of the P-clause receives a progressive interpretation or if the P-

situation is a state. (Note that a habit is also a state. A habit expresses what is “characteristic of the subject 
noun phrase over an extended period of time” [Comrie 1976: 27-28]. A characteristic is by definition a state.) 
 
5.7.4. Mixing verb forms from pattern 2 and pattern 3 in order to express anteriority 
 
In examples like (329a-c) the Q-clause can refer to the present or future, not to the pre-present or past: 
(330) 
If I knew the truth, I would tell you {now / tomorrow / *recently / *yesterday}. 
If the Q-situation lies in the past or pre-present, the Q-clause must use the conditional perfect to express 
anteriority. In that case we do not have a regular pattern 2 conditional any more, but a blending of patterns 2 
and 3: 
(331) 
If I had a lot of money, I would not have accepted this lousy job. 
There is a similar mixing of verb forms when, in a pattern 2 conditional, the P-clause uses the past perfect for 
T-anteriority: She wouldn’t be upset now if Bill had come to see her as promised. 
 
5.7.5. Possible tense combinations in counterfactual-P conditionals 
 
Leaving aside the expression of T-anteriority, there are in principle nine possible tense combinations in 
counterfactual-P conditionals. This follows from the fact that both the P-situation and the Q-situation can lie 
in the present, past, pre-present or post-present, and from the fact that in counterfactual-P conditionals the 
distinction between past and pre-present time reference does not lead to the use of different tenses, because 
the present perfect cannot be used in patterns 2 and 3. In this section we will have a look at these nine 
combinations and examine for each of them whether the P-clause and the Q-clause may be of pattern 2 or 3, 
or both. 
 
5.7.5.1. Past / pre-present P-situation + present Q-situation 
 
In counterfactual-P conditionals, this combination is expressed by using the past perfect in the P-clause 
(=pattern 3) and either the conditional tense (=pattern 2) or the conditional perfect (=pattern 3) in the Q-
clause: 
(332) 
a. 
If she had arrived yesterday, she {would be / would have been} here now.  (pattern 3 P-clause + 
pattern 2 or 3 Q-clause) 
 
 
b. 
If we had read the instructions more carefully we {would know / would have known} what to do now.  
(id.) 
 
 
c. 
Undoubtedly, the whole state of affairs would be much better if the earth had remained wheelless.  
(COB-W) (pattern 2 Q-clause + pattern 3 P-clause) 
 
 
d. 
If only Lotte had told him this before, she might not now be dead.  (COB-W) (pattern 3 P-clause + 
pattern 2 Q-clause; ‘might’ = ‘would perhaps’) 
However, there are cases in which one of either would or would have is preferred, or even obligatory, in the 
Q-clause. This may be determined by the nature of the Q-situation. Compare: 
(333) 
a. 
If only we had been born clowns, nothing bad would happen to us except a few bruises and a smear of 
whitewash.  (OMIH) 
 
 
b. 
If only we had been born clowns, nothing bad would be happening to us except a few bruises and a 
smear of whitewash. 
 
 
c. 
If only we had been born clowns, nothing bad would have happened to us except a few bruises and a 
smear of whitewash. 
 
 
d. 
If only we had been born clowns, nothing bad would have been happening to us except a few bruises 
and a smear of whitewash. 
In (333a), the Q-situation can be interpreted as located in the present only if it is interpreted as referring to a 
habit. In (333b), reference to the present results from the use of the progressive in the Q-clause. The Q-
situation is now interpreted as semelfactive. In (333c), the conditional perfect locates the Q-situation in the 
present if it indicates a habit rather than a single situation. But, as is clear from (333d), this changes when the 
progressive form is used. The generalizations ensuing from this are (a) that a counterfactual Q-clause with a 
dynamic (nonstative) verb in the conditional tense or conditional perfect can only refer to the present if the 

interpretation is habitual or progressive, and (b) that the progressive form refers to a single (semelfactive) 
situation, whereas the nonprogressive form refers to a habit (at least, if the verb is nonstative, i.e. can take the 
progressive form). These conclusions are not surprising, given the fact that a nonhabitual nonprogressive 
nonstative verb cannot refer to the present in English, except in special uses such as commentaries, captions, 
etc. (This explains why we cannot normally say *At this very moment she goes home to refer to a single 
durative present situation.) 
It should also be noted that in counterfactual-P conditionals, the combination ‘past / pre-present P-
situation + present Q-situation’ can never be expressed by means of a past tense in the P-clause. This is 
because there is a clash between the fact that the P-situation is to be interpreted as W-anterior to the Q-
situation and the fact that in the temporal domain created by would (have) in the Q-clause a relative past 
tense in the P-clause could only be interpreted as expressing T-simultaneity. The only exception is when the 
latter interpretation is ruled out by the context, as in (334): 
(334) 
[“Do you look back to those times with nostalgia?” — “No, not really.] If we did not do what we did, South 
Africa would have been a terrible place at the moment.”  (BBC World Service) (The interpretation that the 
P-situation is W-anterior to the present Q-situation is enforced by the presence of ‘what we did’, whose 
situation can only be interpreted as W-simultaneous with the situation of its head clause [=the P-clause] and 
which, given the context, can only refer to the past.) 
 
5.7.5.2. Past / pre-present P-situation + post-present Q-situation 
 
The second possibility as to the time reference in the two clauses of a pattern 3 counterfactual-P conditional 
is the combination of a counterfactual past P-situation with a counterfactual post-present Q-situation. This is 
expressed by the use of the past perfect in the P-clause and the conditional perfect in the Q-clause 
(irrespective of whether the Q-verb is stative or dynamic): 
(335) 
a. 
If she had arrived only yesterday, she would still have been here tomorrow.  (This implies: ‘but that 
won’t be the case because she actually arrived earlier than yesterday’.) 
 
 
b. 
If she hadn’t arrived by six o’clock, she wouldn’t have performed at tonight’s concert.  (This implies: 
‘but she has arrived and will perform’.) 
 
 
c. 
If she hadn’t missed her plane, she’d have performed at tonight’s concert.  (This implies: ‘but she 
missed her plane and will not perform’.) 
In examples like these, the Q-clause does not normally use the conditional tense, because this would suggest 
a FIS reading rather than a counterfactual one: 
(336) 
If she had arrived by six o’clock, she would perform at tonight’s concert.  (This is the FIS version of either ‘If 
she arrived by six, she will perform’, which may be either closed-P or open-P, or ‘If she has arrived by six, 
she will perform’, which has an open P-clause referring to the post-present.) 
 
5.7.5.3. Past / pre-present P-situation + past / pre-present Q-situation 
 
In this type of counterfactual, the Q-clause always uses the conditional perfect while the tense form in the P-
clause depends on the temporal relation between the P-situation and the Q-situation: 
(a) If the P-situation precedes the Q-situation, the P-clause uses the past perfect: 
(337) 
You wouldn’t have been arrested if you hadn’t knocked off the constable’s helmet. 
(b) If the P-situation is to be interpreted as W-simultaneous with the Q-situation i.e. if the two situations are 
contemporaneous or overlapping) there are in principle two possibilities as to the use of the tense form in the 
P-clause. The latter can use either a relative past tense (expressing T-simultaneity in the past domain created 
by the head clause) or a past perfect (effecting indirect binding). In the former case the resulting conditional 
is a mixture of pattern 2 and pattern 3, in the latter it is a regular pattern 3 conditional. (On the whole, there is 
a strong preference for the latter option.) 
(338) 
a. 
I would have denied it if I {?was / had been} in a position to, [but I {wasn’t / *hadn’t been}].  (Indirect 
binding is not possible in the ‘but’-clause because this is not a temporally subordinated [=bound] 
clause.) 
 
 
b. 
If you {?weren’t / hadn’t been} my friend at the time, I wouldn’t have stood by you. 
 
 
c. 
I would have helped you if I {could / could have / had been able to}. 

(c) If the past / pre-present actualization of the P-situation is to be interpreted as W-posterior to the past / pre-
present actualization of the Q-situation, the P-clause uses the past tense of be going to or (more commonly) 
the past perfect of be going to: 
(339) 
a. 
[I didn’t believe what they told me about John’s suicide.] If John {had been / ?was } going to commit 
suicide, he wouldn’t have bought a gun. [He would’ve bought poison.] 
 
 
b. 
[I’m sure you’re right and he was going to burgle the building when you happened to pass by.] If he 
{was / had been} going to clean the windows, he wouldn’t have put the ladder where he actually put it. 
The use of had been going to rather than was going to is another instance of indirect binding. 
 
5.7.5.4. Extended present P-situation + past / pre-present Q-situation 
 
In a counterfactual-P conditional, this temporal combination can be expressed in two ways, depending on the 
(non)stative nature of the verb of the P-clause. If that verb is stative, we normally use the past tense in the P-
clause and the conditional perfect in the Q-clause. This is a mixture of pattern 2 (which is interpreted as 
counterfactual if the P-clause refers to the present) and pattern 3. (We have to use the conditional perfect in 
the Q-clause because there is anteriority to be expressed: a conditional tense form would refer to the present, 
not to the past, as in I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t your sister.) 
(340) 
a. 
If I knew the answer, I would already have told it to you yesterday.  (pattern 2 P-clause + pattern 3 Q-
clause) 
 
 
b. 
If you commuted to London every day, I wouldn’t have thought of marrying you.  (id.) (The ‘extended 
present’ interpretation follows from the habitual reading.) 
 
 
c. 
She wouldn’t have proposed to you if you didn’t have such a good job.  (pattern 3 Q-clause + pattern 2 
P-clause) 
 
 
d. 
[Ninety Conservatives, despite all sorts of pressure, have kept their names to a motion on the Order 
Paper in the House of Commons that is critical of Mr Macleod, the Colonial Secretary.] Lord Hailsham 
would never have counter-attacked Lord Salisbury with such bitterness, unless this was a split that 
worries the Government.  (LOB) (id.) (Note the use of ‘worries’, which confirms the present time 
reference of ‘was’ in the counterfactual P-clause.) 
 
 
e. 
[If I asked to be transferred to a different parish, a different diocese, then perhaps the furore would end, 
at least as far as the Church is concerned. I know this is an act of cowardice, but I can’t separate myself 
from his crimes. I keep thinking that] if I was a better priest, if I knew more, if I had the gift of 
persuasion, I could have talked him into giving himself up.  (COB-W) 
The idea of ‘extended present’ i.e. present inclusive of the past Q-STO) is essential here. Compare: 
(341) 
a. 
If Mary were here, our preparations for the garden party yesterday would have gone off much better.  
(extended present time reference in the P-clause) 
 
 
b. 
(Said at two in the afternoon)  If Mary {had been / *were} here this morning, we would already have 
finished cleaning up an hour ago.  (nonextended present time reference in the P-clause) 
If the verb of the P-clause is nonstative, we cannot use the past tense to refer to the extended present, but we 
can use the past perfect—see 5.7.2. The conditional expressing the required temporal combination is then a 
regular pattern 3 conditional: 
(342) 
If your father had spoken at the meeting today, he would have rehearsed his speech in front of me yesterday. 
 
5.7.5.5. Both clauses referring to the present or extended present 
 
In a counterfactual-P conditional, this temporal combination is normally expressed by the use of the past 
tense in the P-clause and the conditional tense in the Q-clause, i.e. by a regular pattern 2 conditional. 
(Remember that a counterfactual ‘present situation’ can only be a state [e.g. habit, arrangement, intention...] 
or a progressive situation. This is true irrespective of whether the P-clause implying #P belongs to a 
counterfactual-P conditional of pattern 2 or of pattern 3.) 
(343) 
a. 
If I was an engineer, I would know how to mend this.  (pattern 2 throughout) 
 
 
b. 
The soldiers wouldn’t be fortifying their positions if they weren’t afraid of an artillery bombardment.  
(id.) 

However, as we saw in section 5.7.2, a pattern 3 conditional can under certain conditions also refer to present 
situations. In that case the past perfect in the P-clause effects indirect binding. (Direct binding, i.e. the 
expression of T-simultaneity in the intensional past domain, would require using the past tense.) 
(344) 
If I’d been an engineer, I would’ve known how to mend this.  (pattern 3) 
Another possibility is a combination of a pattern 2 P-clause (with a stative verb) and a pattern 3 Q-clause: 
(345) 
a. 
If I was an engineer, I would’ve known how to mend this. 
 
 
b. 
[We always say that] if Humphs wasn’t around, the radio programme wouldn’t have existed.  (BBC 
Radio 4) (Both clauses refer to an extended present, which includes the period of time from the 
inception of the programme.) 
The following is an example similar to (345a), except for the fact that ‘present’ now means PR=AST, i.e. the 
present of a novel which is by convention referred to by the past tense: 
(346) 
[Yet sleep was as important to Morse as to any other soul; and specifically on the subject of sleep, the Greek 
poets and the Greek prose-writers had left behind several pieces of their literary baggage in the lumber-room 
of Morse’s mind.] And if, for him, the whole of the classical corpus had to be jettisoned except for one single 
passage, he would probably have opted for the scene depicting the death of Sarpedon, from Book XVI of the 
Iliad ...  (DOC) 
 
5.7.5.6. Extended present P-situation + post-present Q-situation 
 
This temporal combination too can be expressed in three ways: we can use a regular pattern 2 conditional, a 
regular pattern 3 conditional, or (under the conditions specified in 5.7.2) a combination of a pattern 2 P-
clause with a pattern 3 Q-clause: 
(347) 
a. 
If I {was / were} an engineer, I would mend that machine tomorrow.  (pattern 2) 
 
 
b. 
If I had been an engineer, I would have mended that machine tomorrow.  (pattern 3) 
 
 
c. 
If I {was / were} an engineer, I would have mended that machine tomorrow.  (patterns 2 + 3) 
 
5.7.5.7. Post-present P-situation + past / pre-present Q-situation 
 
This type of counterfactual has to be of pattern 3: 
(348) 
If you’d come tomorrow instead of today, you wouldn’t have planned things well (yesterday). 
 
5.7.5.8. Post-present P-situation + present Q-situation 
 
In this case the counterfactual conditional uses the past perfect in the P-clause and either the conditional 
tense or the conditional perfect in the Q-clause: 
(349) 
If the end of the world had been coming tomorrow, we would {be / have been} working in vain now.  (The 
reason why the P-clause cannot use ‘had come’ has been explained in the comment added to example [327a] 
above.) 
 
5.7.5.9. Post-present P-situation + post-present Q-situation 
 
This combination is possible under certain conditions only—see section 5.7.2 above. It is expressed by a 
regular pattern 3 conditional: 
(350) 
If they had come to visit me tomorrow instead of today, I would have taken my day off tomorrow. 
 
5.7.6. Counterfactual P-clauses functioning as Q-clauses 
 
A P-clause which actually functions as the Q-clause of another (explicit or covert) P-clause uses either would 
or would have for extended present counterfactuality and would have for past counterfactuality: 
(351) 
a. 
If you would be able to open my safe (if you had the right instruments), it is time I bought a more 
modern one. 

 
 
b. 
If you would {be / have been} able to solve this problem if you {were / had been} an engineer, I wish 
you were one. 
 
 
c. 
If you would have been able to open my safe (if you had had the right instruments), it is time I bought a 
more modern one. 
In these examples the superficial Q-clause is not actually the Q-clause of the counterfactual conditional, so 
that it does not use would (have). The superficial if-clause functions as the Q-clause of a counterfactual-P 
conditional. This counterfactual-P conditional then forms the premise for the conclusion expressed in the 
superficial Q-clause. (This means that the counterfactual-P conditional is treated as a closed or open P, which 
forms the premise for the conclusion expressed in the superficial Q-clause. The over-all conditional is thus an 
inferential. As we saw in 5.4 and 5.5, any tense can be found in the Q-clause of a closed-P or open-P 
inferential.) 
 
5.7.7. The time of the conclusion 
 
In direct speech, a pattern 3 counterfactual expresses a present conclusion, i.e. a conclusion drawn at the 
temporal zero-point. However, in IRS, FIS and PR=AST, counterfactuals of pattern 3 express a past 
conclusion. Compare: 
(352) 
a. 
If I had known the answer, I would have known what to do.  (direct speech: present conclusion about 
counterfactual past situations) 
 
 
b. 
[She realized that] if she had known the answer, she would have known what to do.  (IRS: past 
conclusion about counterfactual situations that are W-simultaneous or W-anterior to the time of 
reaching the conclusion) 
 
 
c. 
[She blamed herself for not studying the instructions properly.] If she had done that, she would have 
known what to do.  (FIS: past inference from a counterfactual anterior P-situation to a counterfactual 
Q-situation which is W-simultaneous with or W-anterior to the time of making the inference) 
 
 
d. 
“Naturally I thought it concerned the current trial.” — “Well, you thought wrong! In my opinion you 
didn’t think at all!”. Which was true.] But if he had thought, should he have let Bardi be butchered? [He 
tried to say something of the kind as tactfully as possible but the General rolled over him like a tank.]  
(COB-W) (This example is also interesting in that the ‘should’ of the direct speech conditional ‘if I had 
thought, should I have let Bardi be butchered?’ has been retained in the FIS version, in spite of the 
change of subject. ‘Should’ is normally possible with first person subjects only.) 
In direct speech, a pattern 2 counterfactual-P conditional also expresses a present conclusion. In IRS, FIS and 
PR=AST, these conditionals remain unchanged but also express a past conclusion. Compare: 
(353) 
a. 
If I knew the answer, I would know what to do.  (direct speech: present conclusion about 
counterfactual present or tentative post-present situations) 
 
 
b. 
[She blamed herself for not studying the instructions properly.] She realized that if she knew them by 
heart, she would know what to do.  (IRS: past conclusion about counterfactual situations that are W-
simultaneous with the time of reaching the conclusion, or about tentative situations W-posterior to that 
time) 
 
 
c. 
[She blamed herself for not studying the instructions properly.] If she knew them by heart, she would 
know what to do.  (similar, but now FIS instead of IRS) 
 
5.7.8. Counterfactual P-clause combining with Q-clause from another possible world 
 
A counterfactual P-clause may sometimes combine with a Q-clause referring to a different possible world. In 
the following examples it combines with a factual Q-clause: 
(354) 
a. 
[What an impertinence for anyone here, for a nonelected person, to say, “We forgive on behalf of those 
people.” It is offensive even to suggest that somehow that is our right.] If it were, then forgiveness 
applies to every offence committed within the realm.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[Last September a public poll showed that ... the Liberals were ahead]: 43 per cent were in favour of 
‘the Grits’ if a federal election had been held last autumn, 38 per cent for the Conservatives and 12 per 
cent for the Communists.  (LOB) 
 
 
c. 
There is nothing wrong with the model range that Land Rover has now, if only it were built properly.  
(COB-W) 

This is in keeping with sections 4.2.9 and 8.3.2, where it is said that it is only by implicature that in a pattern 
3 counterfactual-P conditional the Q-clause too tends to be interpreted as being counterfactual. 
 
5.7.9. ‘Had + perfect infinitive’ in the Q-clause of pattern 3 
 
As noted by Kruisinga (1932: 439-440), the form ‘had + perfect infinitive’, which nowadays only appears in 
the P-clauses of counterfactual-P conditionals of pattern 3, used to be also possible in the Q-clauses of such 
conditionals. He adduces the following examples: 
(355) 
a. 
If you hadn’t gone to Strelsau, you and I and Fritz had been in heaven by now. 
 
 
b. 
Possibly the pride even of Richard Feverel had been swamped if the act of composition were easy at 
such a time. 
 
 
c. 
Mrs. Doria, an amiable widow, had surely married but for her daughter Clare.  (but for = if it hadn’t 
been for) 
This possibility is no longer made use of in present-day Standard English. 
 
5.7.10. The ‘double pluperfect’ in the P-clause of pattern 3 
 
Another thing worth noting in connection with the use of tenses in counterfactual pattern 3 conditionals is 
that some people can use ‘had + perfect infinitive’ in the if-clause: 
(356) 
a. 
Had he have lost this frame, it would have been all over for him.  (BBC) 
 
 
b. 
If {he’d ‘ve done / he had ‘ve done} that, he would have been fired on the spot. 
This use, which Bailey (1989: 279) refers to as the ‘double pluperfect’, may be considered substandard by 
educated speakers of southern British English, but is not uncommon in some regional and social varieties of 
English. 
The following examples come mainly from spoken corpora. (Notice that the contracted form ‘d have is 
definitely more common than had have or had’ve.) 
(357) 
a. 
[I can give you examples now to show that is the case.] If you’d have gone on using it as many people 
have you’d find that there are systematic biases and errors in that model which people still accept...  
(COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
[“And I grabbed him and we got him down and just as he went into a dropsy fit I thought Oh my God] 
if he’d have ever gone up there” — [“Mm.” — “Cos there’s a brick wall at the back of that” — “Right. 
Yes I can see it yeah” — “and] if he’d have gone you wouldn’t have had no chance of holding him.” — 
[“No.” — “I mean he would have killed hisself.”]  (COB-S) 
 
 
c. 
And I think if we’d have hit him too much I think it would’ve gone the you know the wrong way really.  
(COB-S) 
 
 
d. 
You’d have won that cup for us if you’d have managed us.  (COB-S) 
 
 
e. 
[I’ve often said to people probably feeling bitter in my own way sometimes I have sat and thought] I’d 
have coped better if he had have been in a wheelchair.  (COB-S) 
 
 
f. 
If he had have been in a wheelchair I’d have been getting up changing him washing him putting him 
back in the wheelchair.  (COB-S) 
 
 
g. 
I hate to think what would have happened if we’d have lost.  (COB-S) 
 
 
h. 
Now if she’d have given it to me Friday afternoon I could have given it to him Friday night.  (COB-S) 
 
 
i. 
Well what if I had have spent the time, if I’d have made time and said...  (COB-S) 
 
 
j. 
If I’d have gone to university I’d have got a very good job then I’d be paying more tax.  (COB-S) 
 
 
k. 
If I’d have gone I’d have saved myself a lot of time and heartache I suppose.  (COB-S) 
 
 
l. 
If I’d have told him that at the start I wouldn’t have got all the information.  (COB-S) 
 
 
m. 
[There’s just one thing gone wrong this year—that disallowed goal against Everton.] If we had have got 
three points then, we would be well ahead of Everton and in control of our own destiny.  (COB-W: 
letter to sports magazine) 
 
 
n. 
But nothing would’ve happened if she’d’ve answered the phone.  (COB-S) 
 
 
o. 
[No they were really lucky because his brother is fifteen and apparently] if they’d’ve left it too much 
later he wouldn’t have got out of Iran.  (COB-S) 
 
 
p. 
If you, if you had’ve got all of us together, you’d, you’d find yourself with five very very different 
points of view.  (COB-S) 

In Standard English the past perfect (‘past tense + past participle’) is not normally thus backshifted to ‘past 
tense + perfect infinitive’. The reason why it is sometimes done is presumably the need felt by the speaker to 
express not only counterfactuality but also anteriority. (Note that had’ve can never replace had in imaginary-
P conditionals.) The same tendency may be the reason why with some verbs the construction ‘past perfect + 
infinitive’ can be replaced with ‘past perfect + perfect infinitive’: 
(358) 
[Finn thought] how different things might have been if one of the officers, that middle-aged detective 
sergeant for instance, had happened to have been involved in the investigation into Queenie’s death eleven 
years before.  (LOD) 
Here the author uses had happened to have been instead of had happened to be in the P-clause. (This 
phenomenon is similar to the above mentioned possibility of ‘indirect binding’ by tense forms.) There is a 
slight difference in meaning between the two choices: the simple infinitive means ‘if someone had, by 
chance, been involved in the past investigation into Queenie’s death’, while the perfect infinitive means ‘if 
someone had, by chance, had the experience of being involved in the past investigation into Queenie’s 
death’. 
 
5.7.11. Would have in the P-clause of a pattern 3 conditional 
 
In standard British English, would have in the P-clause of a counterfactual-P pattern 3 conditional can only 
have a volitional interpretation: There wouldn’t have been a problem if you’d have consented. In informal 
American English, however, would have is not infrequent (even in print) as a substitute for the past perfect—
see Tedeschi (1981: 261) and Hancock (1993). A problem for checking the frequency of this use of would 
have in spoken British English is that the form is usually contracted to ‘d have, which makes it 
indistinguishable from one of the contracted forms of had have (the others being had’ve and hadda). In our 
opinion, Quirk et al. (1985) are mistaken when they write that “the contraction for the operator in the 
conditional clause is sometimes misinterpreted as replacing had rather than would, giving rise to an error that 
is found in uneducated writing and its fictional representation: If I hadda seen her, I woulda told her.” (p. 
1012) This claim—that If I’d have done it is short for If I would have done it rather than for If I had have 
done it—is to a certain extent undermined by examples such as (357e,h,i,m,p) in which had is not contracted 
so that it is clear that the form used is had have, not would have. It also runs counter to the observation that 
had have was already quite common in the 15th and 16th centuries (see Visser 1973: 2423-2426), while 
nonvolitional would have (in a P-clause) is certainly a relatively recent phenomenon, which has not (yet?) 
found its way into British English the way it has done into American and Irish English, as well as into other 
languages. For example, Aune (1990) discusses the phenomenon that, in “familiar” French, the conditional 
and conditional perfect are increasingly supplanting the past tense and the past perfect in pattern 2 and 3 
conditionals. The same is true of Dutch. 
 
5.8. Conclusion 
 
In this chapter we have given a sketch of a model of the English tense system and investigated the use of 
tenses in the various types of possible-world conditionals. This investigation has revealed a large number of 
rules, regularities and constraints. Without repeating these in detail, we can remind the reader of the most 
salient of them: 
(a) Various tenses can be found in the clauses of a factual-P conditional, depending on the subtype to which 
it belongs. 
(b) In some neutral-P conditionals (e.g. the gnomic ones) only the present tense can be used. In the others it 
is generally the case that the P-clause can use any of the absolute tenses, but no relative tenses. (This means, 
amongst other things, that neutral P-clauses referring to the post-present use the Future Perspective System 
rather than the Present Perspective System.) As to the use of tenses in the Q-clause, there is no a priori 
restriction, except that the Q-tense must be in keeping with the particular kind of neutral-P conditional in 
which it is used. 
(c) In closed-P conditionals where P echoes either a proposition about the actual world or the Q-proposition 
of a closed-P conditional, any verb form that can be used to refer to the actual world or to express a closed 
assumption about it can also be used to refer to the P-situation or the Q-situation in the closed theoretical 
world. This means that for post-present time reference closed P-clauses use the Future Perspective System. 

Since a closed P-clause can also echo the Q-clause of other types of conditionals, any tenses that can be used 
in Q-clauses can also be used in closed P-clauses. 
(d) Open P-clauses referring to the post-present have to use the Present Perspective System because the 
intensional P-domain coincides with the intensional temporal domain created by the Q-clause. Open-P 
clauses referring to the present or past use the present or past tense, respectively, with backshifting in IRS, 
FIS and PR=AST, and with perfect tense forms to express T-anteriority. 
(e) Tentative P-clauses create an intensional domain which is treated as a past temporal domain. The P-clause 
uses the past tense, the head clause the conditional tense. These forms cannot be backshifted in IRS, FIS or 
PR=AST, but they are when the speaker wishes to express T-anteriority. 
(f) Counterfactual P-clauses also create an intensional domain which is treated as a past temporal domain. If 
the P-clause refers to present unreality, the conditional usually has the form of a pattern 2 conditional. A 
pattern 3 conditional mostly expresses past counterfactuality, but can under certain conditions also refer to 
the present or post-present. Hybrid conditionals, combining a pattern 2 P-clause with a pattern 3 Q-clause, 
are possible if the P-clause expresses present unreality. 
If there is one conspicuous general principle underlying these tense uses, it is that factual, neutral and 
closed P-clauses establish a temporal domain of their own (which may or may not be W-simultaneous with 
the domain established by the Q-clause), while open, tentative and counterfactual P-clauses have to use a 
relative tense expressing a T-relation in the temporal domain established by the Q-clause. This explains the 
obligatory use of the Present Perspective System in open P-clauses referring to the post-present, as well as 
the obligatory use of past time-sphere tenses in tentative-P and counterfactual-P conditionals, where the 
intensional world referred to has to be treated as a past temporal domain. 

Chapter 6 
 
Modalized case-specifying conditionals 
 
 
In this chapter we will have a brief look at the use of subjunctives and modal auxiliaries in the three types of 
case-specifying conditionals, viz. the ones in which the P-clause is premise-expressing, purely case-
specifying or actualization-conditioning. Once again, we have restricted ourselves to examining those 
conditionals which are not rhetorical, a complete survey of all conditional-types representing an 
impractically large undertaking. 
 
6.1. The subjunctive 
 
Unlike modal auxiliaries, the subjunctive can only be used in P-clauses, not in Q-clauses (except in archaic 
English). 
 
6.1.1. The present subjunctive in the P-clause 
 
In older English, the present subjunctive was often used in the P-clause of an open conditional. In present-
day English, almost all the examples with be that can be found are if need(s) be (in all registers), if truth be 
told (more frequent in written than in spoken English) and quotes from older language (e.g. if music be the 
food of love). 
(359) 
a. 
You ... are able to take the initiative and work independently if need be.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
I’ll take him round and introduce him to a few people, if needs be.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
If truth be told, it all sounds a bit earnest.  (COB-W) 
We do occasionally find somewhat more productive uses of the subjunctive be in literary registers: 
(360) 
No single group of viewers, even if it be the majority, should be served to the exclusion of all other groups; 
no single area or type of television programming, even if it be the most widely acceptable to the majority, 
should be permitted to predominate.  (COB-W) 
However, the examples usually show close semantic links to if need(s) be and if truth be told, except in 
particularly high-flown language. 
(361) 
a. 
But Miss Dior is the true classic which explains, if explanation be necessary, Dior’s decision to breathe 
new life into the perfume without tampering with the scent itself.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[Mrs Mipchin would be on her way home, and would pass by the cottages just below the castle. It was 
rather like the Queen waking up to find a wild-eyed Irishman in her bedroom, but,] if report be true, 
handled with considerably less aplomb.  (COB-W) 
 
6.1.2. The past subjunctive in the P-clause 
 
In pattern 2 conditionals, were is a possible alternative to was, irrespective of whether the P-clause is 
interpreted as tentative or counterfactual. Were is generally preferred to was in a more formal style,24 and if 
interpreted as tentative, it is often felt to have a more highly unlikely meaning than was—moving towards 
unreality: 
(362) 
If he {were / ??was} here at all, you would find him in the library. 
In some cases, the use of were has become more or less stereotyped. The most typical example of this is if I 
were you, which is most frequent in conditional sentences that are meant to give advice. The Q-clause 
typically has a first person subject. (For a discussion of the deictic reference of the pronouns, see section 
4.2.7.) 
                                              
24 In the Co-build corpus we found a ratio of 61.6% was versus 38.4% were. The former is pretty much confined to informal 
registers. 

(363) 
a. 
If I were you, I {shouldn’t / wouldn’t}25 take that threat too seriously. 
 
 
b. 
I {would / should} reconsider my assumptions if I were you. 
 
 
c. 
If I were you, I’d be working hard on my dissertation at this moment. 
 
 
d. 
[“I can’t remember much about myself as a girl.” — “I’m not surprised,” said Mrs White. “All those 
drugs, all that drink, and all that sex.] I wouldn’t want to remember it if I were you.”  (COB-W) (no 
sense of advice) 
In sentences like (363a-c), the expression if I were you is sometimes left out: 
(364) 
a. 
I shouldn’t worry. 
 
 
b. 
I should check those data again before jumping to conclusions. 
 
 
c. 
[Be careful.] I wouldn’t believe everything he says. 
Here I should or I would resembles you should in that the conditional is used to give advice. However, 
because it does not say something directly about ‘you’ but rather says something about ‘me-in-your-place’, it 
is less direct, and therefore weaker than you should. It expresses advice which is generally (ceteris paribus) 
easier to ignore without giving offence or implying confrontation. 
  Of course, if I were you could also be left out in (363d) (and similar examples), but in that case, the ‘I’ 
would have to be heavily accented, in order to point to the implicit ‘if I were you’. The fact that this 
contrastive accent is not necessary in (364a-c), and would in fact change the meaning from advice to a 
statement of what the speaker would do in the addressee’s place (i.e. a change of topic from ‘a possible / 
advisable action for you’ to ‘me in your place’) substantiates an analysis of (363a-c) as giving advice, but 
might seem at first sight to be slightly problematic for the explanation that such advice is face-saving because 
it does not say anything directly about ‘you’ but rather about ‘me in your place’. However, we think it is 
reasonable to say that such advice as is given in (363a-c) and (364a-c) is somewhere between what is 
expressed by (364d), which does not give advice but is to a fair extent about the speaker (albeit a speaker 
empathizing with the addressee) and the direct advice expressed by a sentence like You should take that 
threat seriously, which is very much about the addressee. 
Another use of were is the following. If an open-P conditional with a P-clause in the present tense is 
reported in IRS or FIS, we can occasionally find were instead of was in the P-clause. This means that the 
reporting speaker modalizes the original utterance: she adds her own subjective judgement to the contents of 
the reported conditional. In doing so she changes the original open meaning of P into a tentative one: she 
expresses her own (lower) appreciation of the likelihood of the truth of the P-clause. (Strictly speaking, this 
is a violation of the Gricean Maxim of Quality,26 since there is a certain expectation that, in the default case, 
a speaker using IRS to report another’s utterance will convey the content of the original utterance as 
accurately as possible.) The (b) sentences in the following pairs of examples offer some IRS illustrations: 
(365) 
a. 
We will endorse the use of force only if it is approved in advance by the UN Security Council.  (direct 
speech) 
 
 
b. 
[Some said specifically that] they would endorse the use of force only if it were approved in advance by 
the UN Security Council.  (COB-W) (IRS) 
(366) 
a. 
The Bank will support a cut in interest rates only if it is absolutely sure that inflation will be below the 
Government’s target in two years’ time. 
 
 
b. 
[He said that] the Bank would support a cut in interest rates only if it were absolutely sure that inflation 
would be below the Government’s target in two years’ time.  (COB-W) 
Similarly, in FIS: 
(367) 
a. 
[Since she had left town, she had only been to the cemetery once, and then her hair had been covered by 
a scarf, and she had worn dark glasses. Now she was in Edisonville to stay.] If she were seen near 
Lonnie’s grave and remembered, it could cause a lot of problems.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[Morse had little doubt that Susan Ewers was the sort of housewife to polish her bath-taps daily; the sort 
to feel aggrieved at finding a stray trace of toothpaste in the wash-basin.] If cleanliness were next to 
saintliness, then this lady was probably on the verge of beatification.  (DOC) (FIS) 
                                              
25 As in pattern 2 Q-clauses generally, should can replace would after a first person subject. Of 30 (Cobuild UK) examples of If I 
were you I should / would..., we found that 4 used should, 9 would and 17 ‘d. 
26 This Maxim stipulates, roughly, that a cooperative speaker should tell the truth and not try to deceive the hearer without cogent 
reason. 

In the latter example, the use of were instead of was suggests that Morse is rather doubtful about the truth of 
the statement Cleanliness is next to saintliness: in the FIS version, the condition is represented as a tentative 
rather than an open one. 
It is worth noting that whilst the past subjunctive can replace the past tense in the if-clause of a pattern 2 
conditional, it cannot always do so in a subclause depending on that if-clause. In fact, in subclauses 
depending on an if-clause, were is a regular alternative to was only in reported questions i.e. clausal 
complements of ask, wonder, doubt, etc.): 
(368) 
a. 
If he were certain that Julia {was / ??were} in America, would he feel happier? 
 
 
b. 
If he {wondered / asked himself} whether anything {was / were} wrong with the project, he would 
probably keep his doubts to himself. 
 
6.2. Modal auxiliaries in the Q-clause 
 
6.2.1. Q-clauses combining with a factual, neutral or closed P-clause 
 
There is no particular restriction on modal auxiliaries (whether epistemic or nonepistemic) in Q-clauses 
combining with a factual, neutral or closed P-clause. The only requirement is that the meaning of the 
auxiliary must fit in with that of the conditional as a whole: 
(369) 
a. 
If so many students fail the exams, there {must / should / ought to / may / may well} be something 
wrong with our teaching system.  (The epistemic auxiliaries are in keeping with the inferential nature of 
the conditional.) 
 
 
b. 
If I had a problem, I {would / used to / could / had to} go to my grandmother.  (The nonepistemic 
auxiliaries are in keeping with the actualization-conditioning P-clause and the habitual meaning of the 
conditional.) 
 
 
c. 
If I asked the warder if could leave my cell to go to the chapel, I usually {could / *might} not.  (The 
nonepistemic meaning of ‘could’, which here expresses habitual past permission, is in keeping with the 
actualization-conditioning meaning of the P-clause, but ‘might’ is unacceptable because it cannot 
express past permission and would therefore be interpreted as epistemic.) 
 
6.2.2. Q-clauses combining with an open-P clause 
 
There is no particular restriction either on modal auxiliaries (whether epistemic or nonepistemic) in Q-
clauses combining with an open P-clause referring to the past, pre-present or present. (Here too the only 
requirement is that the meaning of the auxiliary should fit in with that of the conditional as a whole.) 
(370) 
a. 
If, as is possible, the team won yesterday, it {must / may / should / *is to} be top of the League now.  
(The inferential nature of the conditional is in keeping with the use of epistemic auxiliaries in the Q-
clause. However, ‘be to’ has no epistemic uses.) 
 
 
b. 
If you learn French, you can buy a house in the Provence.  (Werth 1997a: 263) (nonepistemic ‘can’) 
 
 
c. 
[I told them that] if I took up Pete’s invitation to go and stay with him, then I {could / couldn’t} meet 
Meg from the Paris train when she arrived.  (IRS) (nonepistemic ‘could[n’t]’ expressing [in]ability) 
In open conditionals referring to the post-present (which have the form of pattern 1), the Q-clause can use 
any epistemic or nonepistemic modal auxiliary implying post-present (non)actualization,27 except epistemic 
must (which expresses a conclusion that is seen as inevitable and is therefore not normally used to express a 
present conclusion concerning the post-present, since we cannot normally be 100% certain about the 
future):28 
(371) 
a. 
If we hurry, we {may / might / could / should / ought to / ??must} catch the 11.45 train.  (epistemic Q) 
 
 
b. 
(headmaster speaking)  You {may / can} leave school at 5 if your bus leaves at 5.14.  (nonepistemic Q) 
 
 
c. 
If you’re going to catch the train, you {must / have to / had better / ought to / should} leave now.  
(nonepistemic Q) 
 
                                              
27 As explained in section 5.1, we treat will expressing predictability as an instance of future tense will. (The future tense often not 
only locates a situation in the future but also has a more or less strong epistemic connotation.) It follows that will expressing 
predictability is not included in the list of epistemic modal auxiliaries referred to in this chapter. 
28 However, there is the odd exception like If you post it now, it must get there by Saturday. 

6.2.3. Q-clauses combining with a tentative or counterfactual P-clause 
 
In the Q-clause of a tentative-P or counterfactual-P conditional, we can normally only find modal auxiliaries 
that have a tentative or counterfactual meaning: 
(372) 
a. 
If we hurried, we might catch the 11.45 train.  (tentative epistemic possibility) 
 
 
b. 
I could do it if I had the proper utensils.  (nonepistemic: ability with tentative or counterfactual 
actualization) 
 
 
c. 
If we had hurried, we {might / could} have caught the 11.45 train.  (counterfactual epistemic 
possibility) 
 
 
d. 
I could have done it if I had had the proper utensils.  (nonepistemic: counterfactual ability) 
 
 
e. 
They {could have helped / would have been able to help} you if you had appealed to them.  
(nonepistemic: ability with counterfactual actualization) 
 
 
f. 
You could use our facilities if you were a student.  (nonepistemic: counterfactual permission) 
Note, however, that contemporary English does not appear to have an auxiliary that can express 
counterfactual epistemic necessity in the Q-clause: 
(373) 
If they had started out earlier, they {would / *should / *ought to / *must} have arrived in time.  (‘Would’ 
expresses prediction, not epistemic necessity: it does not imply that Q is the only possible explanation or 
interpretation of P.) 
On the other hand, it is possible to use epistemic should or ought to in a tentative Q-clause: 
(374) 
a. 
If they started off at once they {ought to / should} be back in time for lunch. 
 
 
b. 
If Oswald were found innocent, then it {should / ought to} be easy enough to find Kennedy’s real 
murderer. 
However, it may be that this use of should and ought to does not really form an exception to the rule (stated 
above) that in the Q-clause of a tentative-P conditional, we can only find modal auxiliaries that have a 
tentative meaning. As noted in Declerck (1991b: 378), nonepistemic should and ought to express ‘escapable’ 
obligation or necessity. Similarly, epistemic should and ought express a not very confident conclusion, i.e. 
they have a sort of tentative meaning. (This is in keeping with the fact that ought was originally the 
conditional tense form of owe, and with the fact that the Dutch, French, etc. equivalents of should and ought 
to are the conditional tense forms of a verb meaning want or owe, e.g. Dutch zou moeten, French devrait, 
etc.) 
 
6.3. Ordinary modal auxiliaries in the P-clause 
 
In connection with P-clauses, we have to make a distinction between ‘ordinary modals’, i.e. auxiliaries that 
can be used with the same meaning(s) in independent clauses, and ‘special P-modals’, which have a meaning 
in P-clauses that they do not have in other contexts. In this section we will be concerned with the use of 
ordinary modals only. 
 
6.3.1. Ordinary modals in closed P-clauses 
 
As pointed out in section 4.2.10, any epistemic or nonepistemic modal that can appear in an independent 
clause, can also be used in the P-clause of a conditional that is given a closed (echoic) interpretation.29 
(375) 
a. 
If, as you say, the treasure {must / should / may / can’t / needn’t} be hidden here, ...  (epistemic) 
 
 
b. 
If Grannie must have been driving too fast, then so must the policeman who caught her.  (Dudman 
1991: 231) (epistemic) 
 
 
c. 
If, as you say, he {must / has got to} stay at home this afternoon, he won’t be able to help me.  
(nonepistemic) 
 
 
d. 
If he can speak French, he’ll probably make the phone call to Paris himself.  (nonepistemic) 
                                              
29 Though there is obviously no semantic contradiction between an open condition and an auxiliary or adverb expressing 
epistemic possibility (may, might, could, perhaps, maybe...), the latter cannot be used in the P-clause of an open-P conditional: 
If she may come... and If she is perhaps coming... can only express a closed condition. The reason for this restriction is that in 
these cases the P-clause refers to the present. For example, may means ‘it is possible that...will’ and thus expresses present 
modality with post-present actualization. This fits in with closed P-clauses but not with open ones: in pattern 1 open-P 
conditionals the P-clause refers to the future, not the present. (See also section 5.4.4 above.) 

As a matter of fact, closed P-conditionals are the only type of theoretical conditional in which the P-clause 
can involve an epistemic auxiliary expressing a logical conclusion. (In section 5.4.4 we reached the same 
conclusion in connection with ‘predictability’ will, which we treat as a future tense auxiliary with a strong 
epistemic meaning component.) The following can be read as a closed-P conditional, but not as an open-P 
one: 
(376) 
If, as this old map suggests, the treasure {must / should / may} be hidden here, we will start looking for it at 
once. 
It should be noted, however, that closed-P conditionals with epistemic auxiliaries in the P-clause are not 
always equally acceptable. The following is grammatical, but much less natural than (376): 
(377) 
If that {must / should / ought to} be the milkman, I will open the door for him. 
While both (376) and (377) express a speaker’s epistemic assessment, in (376) the judgement seems to 
belong to the speaker of (376), even though the assessment is a second-hand one, whilst in (377) the speaker 
seems to be simply echoing the form as well as the content of another speaker’s utterance, and not to be 
taking the epistemic assessment on board as (temporarily) her own. That is, (377) seems to be said with 
heavy ‘quotative’ intonation, of the type that is often (though not evidently here) sarcastic. The difference 
between the two has to do with the scenario that forms a context for interpreting them. Sentence (376) allows 
the scenario of the speaker musing on the whereabouts of the treasure, so the epistemic assessments inherent 
in the modals can easily be seen as belonging, temporarily at least, to her. In contrast, (377) hardly provides a 
context in which the speaker can be imagined to be pondering on the likelihood of the visitor’s being the 
milkman: the epistemic assessments have to be read as parroted quotes and are therefore odd (though not 
ungrammatical). (Dudman’s speeding Granny example, [375b], is closer to the oddity of [377] than to the 
acceptability of [376].) 
Among the nonepistemic modal auxiliaries that are allowed in the P-clause of a closed-P conditional we 
especially note will and would, which can express the following nonepistemic meanings.30 Firstly, a heavily 
accented will can indicate obstinate insistence. The past tense form would can be used similarly in IRS and 
FIS. 
(378) 
a. 
[“He goes out every night.”] — “Well, if he WILL do that, he can’t expect to pass his exams.” 
 
 
b. 
[The sergeant sighed.] If people WOULD keep their money in the tea caddy, it was hardly surprising that 
petty thieves helped themselves.  (FIS) 
 
 
c. 
[She said that she couldn’t say no to her children. I replied that] if she WOULD give the children 
whatever they asked for, she had only herself to blame for their thoughtlessness.  (IRS) 
Note that will expressing obstinate insistence cannot be used in the sense of want to: 
(379) 
If you {want to / *WILL} see her, you will have to go to her aunt’s. 
The reason is that the complement of want is nonfactive, whereas the ‘complement’ of will is factive: if you 
WILL do x implies that you have done and are still doing x. 
Secondly, in a closed conditional, will can indicate an inherent quality or capacity of a thing. This is a 
sense derived from the volitional meaning: 
(380) 
a. 
If, as you say, the boot of your car will hold everything, we shall not need the roof rack. 
 
 
b. 
[That’s good.] If the boat will sleep eight people, none of us will have to go to a hotel. 
Would can be used similarly with reference to the past, or in IRS or FIS: 
(381) 
a. 
[“The boat would sleep eight people, so we often had friends to stay.”] — “If the boat would sleep eight 
people, it must have been pretty large.” 
 
 
b. 
[He read the brochure, and found that there were two double beds and four bunk beds. Good.] If the 
boat would sleep eight people, none of them would have to go to a hotel.  (FIS) 
                                              
30 The first three ‘modal’ uses of will that we are about to discuss have to do with volition (willingness, refusal, insistence...). In 
calling these meanings ‘modal’ we conform to a long and well-established tradition. However, we admit that Palmer (1983: 
242) may well be right when he writes: “the will of insistence is LESS modal than the will of futurity. It is certainly not 
epistemic, nor is it deontic; semantically it corresponds to what in most other languages will be a lexical verb of insisting, 
wanting, etc. Indeed, it is fairly obvious that will used for insistence or willingness retains much of its historical (and lexical) 
meaning. Its occurrence in protases is, then, not unexpected.” 

 
 
c. 
[He realized that] if, as he’d been told, the stadium would seat fifty thousand people, the job of security 
manager was no sinecure.  (IRS) 
Thirdly, in a closed conditional, will (not) can express willingness or a refusal: 
(382) 
a. 
If, as appears to be the case, he will not help us unless he is paid for it, I’m afraid we will have to pay 
him. 
 
 
b. 
If (as you say) he will do the job immediately, we’d better hire him. 
Wouldn’t can be used similarly if the reference is to the past: 
(383) 
a. 
If, as I’m told, the plumber wouldn’t come last time we needed him, we’ll ask an odd job man to do this 
job. 
 
 
b. 
If (as you say) the last time we asked him he wouldn’t do the job immediately, we’d better hire 
someone else this time. 
However, the same thing is not true of affirmative would, except in IRS / FIS or on a habitual interpretation: 
(384) 
a. 
If (as you say) the last time we asked him he {was willing to / *would} do the job immediately, we’d 
better use him again this time. 
 
 
b. 
If he would always lend you a fiver when you needed one in the past, why don’t you ask him for one 
now?  (habitual past willingness) 
 
 
c. 
If last time you asked him to repair your car he said he would do it, why don’t you ask him to mend it 
this time?  (IRS) 
This fits a general pattern, since, as noted by Declerck (1991b: 364), affirmative would cannot express 
willingness with actualization on a specific past occasion, except in reported speech.31 Compare: 
(385) 
a. 
I asked him to lend me a fiver and he {was willing to / *would} (do so). 
 
 
b. 
I asked him to lend me a fiver and he said he would (do so).  (IRS) 
 
 
c. 
Whenever I asked him to lend me a fiver, he would (do so).  (habitual past willingness) (‘Would’ can 
also be interpreted as expressing just past habituality, as in ‘Whenever I passed his house he would 
wave.’) 
 
 
d. 
I asked him to lend me a fiver but he would not (do so).  (negative: refusal) 
Fourthly, in closed (and neutral) P-clauses, would (and, in the first person, should) is used before rather or 
sooner. 
(386) 
If, as you tell me, you’d rather not ask any of your family or friends to lend you the money, you could try and 
borrow it from the bank.  (COB-W) 
Fifthly, would and should can be used similarly before such verbs as like, hate, love, prefer, to express a 
present feeling about a present, past or post-present situation: 
(387) 
a. 
[I assure you I’d like to be somewhere else.] And if I’d like to be somewhere else, it means that I’m not 
feeling happy here! 
 
 
b. 
If, as you tell me, you would’ve liked to come, I would’ve sent you an invitation. 
 
 
c. 
If, as I assume, you {would / *will} like to come, I’ll see that you get an invitation. 
However, this use of would / should does not have a volitional meaning: I’d like to come does not mean ‘I 
want to like to come’ or ‘I am willing to like to come’. It is therefore probably better to assume an alternative 
analysis, according to which I’d like to come is the Q-clause of a pattern 2 conditional with a covert P-
clause—see section 11.7.1.1. 
 
6.3.2. Ordinary modals in neutral and factual P-clauses 
(388) 
a. 
If you must douche when you have a thrush infection, Dr. Crandall says, try this liquid.  (COB-W) 
(neutral-P) 
                                              
31 There is a similar restriction on could expressing past permission or ability: could cannot refer to specific past actualization: 
 
(i) 
Yesterday we {were allowed to / ??could} leave early because the teacher felt sick. 
 
(ii) 
In spite of the bad weather conditions, three athletes {were able to / *could} finish the marathon in less than 2.15 hours. 
 
However, there is no such restriction when would expresses insistence: 
 
(iii) I asked him not to burn the weeds but he WOULD do it. 
 
(iv) It’s your own fault. You WOULD climb the mountain on foot instead of taking the cable-lift. 

 
 
b. 
If you {WILL / MUST} smoke one cigarette after another, of course you’re always coughing.  (factual-P) 
 
 
c. 
If some of you wouldn’t stop drinking when they were pregnant, they were actually giving their baby an 
alcoholic drink too.   (neutral-P) (‘wouldn’t’=‘weren’t willing to’) 
 
 
d. 
Before you buy a seat, try it out in your car if the shop will let you.  (COB-W)   (neutral-P) (‘will’=‘is 
willing to’) 
Epistemic auxiliaries expressing a conclusion are excluded here because the idea of conclusion runs counter 
to the definition of neutral and factual P-clauses: the former do not make any assumption at all as to the truth 
of P, whereas in the latter, P is presented as a fact, not as a conclusion. 
On the other hand, epistemic auxiliaries can be found in the P-clause, provided they do not express 
epistemic necessity (=inference). Thus, may and might, expressing epistemic possibility, present no problem: 
(389) 
She takes anyone as a patient provided they {may / might} eventually be able to pay her. 
 
6.3.3. Ordinary modals in open, tentative or counterfactual P-clauses 
 
In section 6.3.1 we noted that closed P-conditionals are the only type of theoretical conditional in which the 
P-clause can involve an epistemic auxiliary expressing a logical conclusion. However, the use of 
nonepistemic auxiliaries in the P-clauses of open-P, tentative-P or counterfactual-P conditionals is free, 
except that the meaning and form of the auxiliary must be in keeping with the conditional as a whole. 
(390) 
a. 
If, as is possible, he {has to / isn’t to / can’t / needn’t} leave the house, he’ll need some supplies. 
 
 
b. 
If (as is possible) he can speak French, we could ask him to be our interpreter. 
 
 
c. 
Tomorrow, if you {have to / are allowed to / can / need to} leave the house, make sure the cat doesn’t 
get in. 
 
 
d. 
I am sure he would do it if he could. 
 
 
e. 
I would have helped you if I could.  (=could have) 
In this context we can draw special attention to two auxiliaries, viz. be to and will / would: 
 
6.3.3.1. The ordinary modal use of be to in P-clauses 
 
In section 6.4.1, we will discuss a special-P modal use of was to and were to, as in If I {was to / were to} be 
excluded, I’d be furious. In this section we want to draw attention to an ordinary modal use of be to, 
illustrated by the following examples: 
(391) 
a. 
Are we ever to meet again? 
 
 
b. 
[Thirty-two youngsters from the village were sent to the front.] Only eight of them were to come back. 
 
 
c. 
You have to work really hard if you are to make it in this business. 
(391a-b) illustrate a use of be to which is often described as ‘future determined by fate’ or ‘future in the 
hands of destiny’. The meaning of be to in (391c) is related to this, but slightly different because be to occurs 
in an if-clause: it combines the idea of contingency (possible P-actualization in the future) with the idea of 
purpose and volition (‘In order to make it...’ + ‘If you want to make it...’). (The element of volition is 
brought to the fore in Dutch, where the equivalent of this be to is willen, which literally means ‘want to’. In 
English too, want to can sometimes substitute for be to.) 
 
6.3.3.2. Ordinary modal uses of will and would in P-clauses 
 
Will and would cannot normally express mere T-posteriority in open, tentative or counterfactual P-clauses, 
but they can be used there with various nonepistemic modal meanings. Firstly, will (or tentative would) can 
express willingness in open conditionals whose P-clause conveys a polite request or invitation: 
(392) 
a. 
If you {will / would} kindly take your clothes off, the doctor will examine you in five minutes. 
 
 
b. 
Please, if you will, convey my apologies to the College secretary.  (RTM) 
 
 
c. 
I want you to do me a favour, if you will.  (DOJ) 
 
 
d. 
[There’s a chemist’s just round the corner.] If you’d be so good?  (DOC) 
 
 
e. 
I would appreciate it if you would locate the file for one of the gravediggers. [I don’t know his last 
name, but his first name is Jack. Will you?]  (COB-W) 

Such an if-clause with if you will often combines with a Q-clause with I/we will (expressing a promise or 
guarantee). The result is an open-P conditional in which the speaker invites the hearer to cooperate, i.e. 
“negotiates” (Fillmore 1986: 177).32 
(393) 
a. 
If you will bake a cake, I will bring a bottle of wine. 
 
 
b. 
If you will be kind enough to pay the taxi driver, I’ll carry your luggage to your room. 
If you would can be used similarly to indicate willingness in the P-clause of a tentative-P conditional 
(although not normally in combination with would in the pattern asking for cooperation): 
(394) 
a. 
I’d be grateful if you would go home now. 
 
 
b. 
I’d be quite glad if you’d come in and have a drink with me. 
 
 
c. 
If you would listen to me for a moment, I could tell you some important news. 
 
 
d. 
If you would stand in for me tomorrow, I could take the children to the circus. 
 
 
e. 
?If you would look after the children for a moment, I would go to the grocer’s.  (asking for co-operation 
or division of labour) 
The problem with (394e), which is only marginally acceptable, is that in the pattern ‘If you are willing to do 
X, I promise to do Y’, which asks for cooperation, it makes sense to make the request in the P-clause more 
tentative, but it does not make sense to weaken the promise by adding tentativeness. Clearly, if the speaker 
wishes the hearer to comply with her request, she had best make the promise sound as positive as possible, 
i.e. as a real guarantee. 
Secondly, will can be used in open P-clauses to indicate willingness (often on the part of some person 
other than the addressee) but without expressing a polite request or invitation: 
(395) 
a. 
If he’ll listen to you, you can explain to him what he should do. 
 
 
b. 
I’ll give your sister a fiver if she’ll keep this secret. 
 
 
c. 
If she’ll believe that, she’ll believe anything. 
 
 
d. 
If your mother will co-operate, you might ask her these kinds of questions.  (COB-W) 
Would can be used similarly in the P-clause of a tentative-P pattern 2 conditional: 
(396) 
a. 
If he would tell his dog to be silent we wouldn’t have to shout to each other. 
 
 
b. 
I would feel more comfortable if he would put that gun away. 
 
 
c. 
Life would be much easier for her if her children would obey her. 
However, Standard English does not allow the use of would have for counterfactual willingness: 
(397) 
Life would have been much easier for her if her children {had been willing to obey / *would have obeyed} 
her. 
Thirdly, will not can be used in open P-clauses in order to express a refusal: 
(398) 
a. 
If you won’t do it, I’ll ask an odd job man to repair the sink. 
 
 
b. 
You’ll have to marry me if Fred won’t take you. 
 
 
c. 
If Freedom Fighters will not give in—Quo Vadis, John Major?  (COB-W) 
Would not can be used similarly in the P-clause of a tentative-P conditional, but only in IRS, in FIS, on a 
habitual reading, or within an already established past (for tentative meaning) temporal domain: 
(399) 
a. 
If the plumber wouldn’t come, we’d ask an odd job man to repair the sink.  (OK only in FIS or when 
habitual) 
 
 
b. 
?You’d have to marry me if Fred wouldn’t marry you.  (habitual reading virtually impossible, FIS 
unlikely) (This sentence can, however, be salvaged by a suitable context: ‘[If you had to get married 
and the choice was between me and Fred, then] you’d have to marry me if Fred wouldn’t marry you.’ 
— see also [399d] below. Another possibility, in which ‘would’ in the Q-clause does have a habitual 
meaning, is that the speaker of ‘You’d have to marry me if Fred wouldn’t marry you’ is reminiscing 
about childhood ‘getting married’ play-acting games which involved the speaker, the addressee and 
                                              
32 Self-evidently, there is no question of negotiation if the subject of the P-clause is not you, as in the following: 
 
(i) 
[Communication is probably one of the most difficult tasks of management, despite proven experience that] people will 
accept an enormous amount of ‘how’ if only managers will tell them ‘why’.  (COB-W) 
 
As in the negotiating examples, the will in the P-clause expresses willingness, but (i) differs from the negotiating examples in 
that it does not ask for willingness on the part of the hearer and in that it expresses a necessary condition. 

Fred, and in each of which the addressee married either Fred or the speaker, depending on whether, in 
that particular day’s ‘getting married’ game, Fred was willing to marry the addressee or not.) 
 
 
c. 
If Jim wouldn’t help, we’d have to ask Mary.  (OK only in FIS or when habitual) 
 
 
d. 
[I know you don’t like asking Mary for help, but if we were stranded in that little hamlet and needed 
help,] if Jim wouldn’t help, we’d have to ask Mary.  (The P-clause forms part of an already established 
past [tentative] temporal domain.) 
However, wouldn’t have cannot be used in Standard English to express a refusal in a counterfactual P-clause: 
(400) 
a. 
*You would’ve had to marry me if Fred wouldn’t have married you. 
 
 
b. 
*If the plumber wouldn’t have come, we would’ve asked an odd job man to repair the sink. 
Fourthly, like closed P-clauses, open P-clauses allow the use of will to indicate an inherent quality or 
capacity of a thing: 
(401) 
a. 
If the boot of your car will hold everything, [and we’ll find that out in a minute,] we shan’t need the 
roof rack. 
 
 
b. 
[Let’s check the brochure.] If the boat will sleep eight people, none of us will have to go to a hotel. 
There is no similar use of would in the P-clause of a tentative-P or counterfactual-P conditional: 
(402) 
a. 
*If this boat would sleep eight people, none of us would have to go to a hotel. 
 
 
b. 
*If the boat would have slept eight people, none of us would have had to go to a hotel.  (Compare: *If 
we had hired a boat that would have slept eight people...) 
Note, however, that would is fine in a relative clause depending on a tentative or counterfactual P-clause: 
(403) 
a. 
If we hired a boat that would sleep eight people, none of us would have to go to a hotel. 
 
 
b. 
If we had hired a boat that would sleep eight people, none of us would have had to go to a hotel.  (Note 
that the relative clause itself is not counterfactual. This explains why it cannot use ‘would have slept’. 
The latter form could only be used to express either anteriority [e.g. ‘If we had hired a boat that would 
have slept eight people in 1960, we would have found that it only had berths for four people in these 
days of luxurious personal space requirements’] or when the relative clause expresses a counterfactual 
supposition beyond the counterfactual supposition expressed in the ‘if’-clause [e.g. ‘If we had hired a 
boat that would have slept eight people if they had all been aged under nine, we wouldn’t have fitted 
eight adults in.’]) 
Would expressing an inherent quality or capacity of a thing can also be the result of ‘backshifting’ will in IRS 
or FIS: 
(404) 
(He said that) if the boat would sleep eight people, none of us would have to go to a hotel. 
Fifthly, unlike what we have observed in connection with closed-P and factual-P conditionals, accented will 
expressing obstinate insistence cannot be found in the P-clause of an open-P conditional: 
(405) 
[I hope you enjoy your new job on the local paper, but] if, once you’re there, you {keep / *WILL keep} 
missing deadlines, you won’t last long. 
The reason is that will for obstinate insistence is factive (see section 6.3.1 above) and therefore cannot refer 
to the post-present. 
Sixthly, if you will is old-fashioned in the sense of if you like,33 but it survives in current English, in 
approximately the sense of ‘if you will accept my expressing it in these terms’ or ‘if you prefer to express it 
in these terms’. Compare: 
(406) 
a. 
I can come and see you tomorrow if you {like / *will}. 
 
 
b. 
He became her senior adviser—her deputy, if you will.  (Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, 1989: 
1461) 
 
 
c. 
So that’s my, if you will, analytic strategy.  (COB-S) 
Sometimes if you will is a verbal gesture acknowledging a particularly novel or creative use of language, or 
perhaps an extension of the normal use of a term, or the use of a metaphor (which may or may not be a novel 
one): 
                                              
33 However, will still means ‘wish’ in examples like You can stay or leave, as you will; You can go wherever you will (=formal). 

(407) 
a. 
[This is not merely some rectangular thing on the table but it is a thing that it’s pickupable. I can write 
on it. It is in fact foldable.] This surface is walkoverable, if you will.  (COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
[Now we’ve progressed to a degree of gun battles in the street er a number of merchants] who have seen 
the writing on the wall if you will [and know that there are mobs on their way to loot their stores are 
trying to take some pro-active action now. And a number of them have armed themselves].  (COB-S) 
It may be noted, finally, that this type of if you will-conditional belongs to none of the three canonical tense 
patterns, but the condition expressed by the P-clause appears to be open in the sense that the hearer may or 
may not accept the formulation presented in the Q-situation. Also, this conditional exemplifies a kind of 
‘rhetorical’ (rather than case-specifying) conditional: since the P-clause comments on the formulation of the 
Q-clause, it is a ‘metalinguistic-P conditional’—see section 10.3.4. 
Seventhly, we use would before like, hate, love, prefer in P-clauses that express an open condition and 
have a second or third person subject: 
(408) 
a. 
If you {would / *will} like to come to the party next time, I’ll see that you get an invitation. 
 
 
b. 
I’ll choose the menu tomorrow, unless {you’d / *you’ll} prefer to do it yourself. 
 
 
c. 
If you would like to know more information, call Rowena.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
I won’t do it if you’d hate that.  (compare: ??{I / He} won’t do it if I’d hate that.) 
Eighthly, should can be used similarly before like, hate, love, prefer in P-clauses with a first person subject: 
(409) 
Will we have the chance of stopping at a pub if we {should / would} like to have a rest? 
When mentioning the same use of {should / would} {like / love / hate / prefer} in connection with closed-P 
clauses in section 6.3.2, we noted that we are not sure about the modal status of the auxiliaries and referred to 
section 11.7.1 for an alternative analysis. However this may be, it is clear that the use of should in (409) is 
different from that in sentences like the following: 
(410) 
a. 
If I should {like / love} it in the States, would you consider coming out to join me? 
 
 
b. 
If I should hate it in the US, my sister will lend me the airfare home. 
In these examples should is used in the sense of ‘by any chance’—a use which is generally possible in 
pattern 1 and 2 conditionals (see section 6.4.2 below). This should is not replaceable by would and can be 
found with second and third person subjects too: 
(411) 
a. 
If he should hate it in the US, my sister will lend him the airfare home. 
 
 
b. 
If she should love it in the States, I will consider going there to join her. 
 
 
c. 
If Tom should one day like to buy a car of his own, would you lend him the money? 
It should also be noted that, as a rule, would / should will not be used before like, love, hate, etc. if these 
verbs do not have a direct object of any kind (a noun phrase, an infinitive clause or the pro-form to). 
Compare: 
(412) 
a. 
You can go home now if {you like / ?you’d like).  (In Cobuild UK corpora we found 552 examples of 
‘if...would like’ or ‘if...’d like’. Only three, each of them at the end of the sentence, were without a 
complement. In the Cobuild US corpus the ratio was 4 out of 82.) 
 
 
b. 
You can join us if you’d like to. 
(413) 
a. 
If {you like / ??you’d like}, I’ll buy you an ice-cream. 
 
 
b. 
I’ll buy you an ice-cream if you’d like me to. 
 
 
c. 
I’ll buy you an ice-cream if you’d like one. 
 
6.4. The use of special-P modals in P-clauses 
 
There are some modal auxiliaries which, in a particular meaning, can only be found in the P-clauses of some 
type(s) of conditional: 
 
6.4.1. Were to in P-clauses 
 
In a tentative-P pattern 2 conditional, the modal past in the P-clause may be replaced by ‘were to + 
infinitive’. In more informal registers ‘was to + infinitive’ can be used similarly. (For other interpretations of 
‘be to + infinitive’, see section 6.4.3 below.) 
(414) 
a. 
If he {were / was} to offer resistance, they would not hesitate to use their truncheons. 

 
 
b. 
[Of the candidates who’ve put their case so far it’s an arch conservative, Ivan Poloskov who’s drawn 
the greatest applause.] And if he were to become Russian party chief, he would almost certainly oppose 
both Mr Gorbachev and Mr Yeltsin’s reform plans.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
“It just wouldn’t be right if he was to be judged on what happens on Sunday.”  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
If I was to put them in a situation where their lives were at risk and they were to be killed, I could not 
live with that.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
But if I were to treat it as a home, were I ever to have it as I’d really like, they would have me out and 
beheaded [if it were the revolution times again: the travelling guillotine would be here for me.]  (COB-
W) 
 
 
f. 
[EPLF units are threatening attacks on Asmara airport.] If they were to close it down, this would cut the 
army’s last lifeline. 
Similarly, were to and was to can be found in a pattern 2 conditional which is the result of backshifting an 
open-P conditional. Compare: 
(415) 
a. 
If John {arrives / should arrive} late, we won’t wait for him.  (direct speech: pattern 1) 
 
 
b. 
I said that if John {arrived / should arrive / were to arrive / was to arrive} late, we wouldn’t wait for 
him.  (IRS: pattern 2; ‘were / was to arrive late’ represents the reported condition as tentative rather 
than open.) 
 
 
c. 
[He was sure by now that Ted Heath’s government could not last long. Industrial disputes ... left the 
people dissatisfied.] If Heath were to go to the country in the next year or so, he was sure Labour would 
be back in power. [He was right.]  (COB-W) (FIS) 
Conditionals with were / was to cannot be backshifted in IRS, FIS and PR=AST. This is in keeping with the 
fact that ‘had been to + infinitive’ is also ungrammatical in direct speech: 
(416) 
a. 
[Strangely, however, Julia had experienced little sense of shock. A hardening of heart, rather; and a 
growing conviction that] if Brooks were to turn up murdered somewhere, his step-daughter would not 
be figuring alone on any list of possible suspects.  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
*If Brooks had been to turn up murdered somewhere, his step-daughter would not have been figuring 
alone on any list of possible suspects. 
The use of ‘was / were to + present infinitive’ usually has the effect of representing a tentative supposition 
about the post-present as even more unlikely, remote, uncertain, polite. That is, it can be used to make the 
possibility of a post-present P-situation sound even less probable or to render a suggestion even more 
tentative: 
(417) 
a. 
If this ship {were / was} to sink, only half of the passengers would be able to find a place in the 
lifeboats. 
 
 
b. 
I think she’d appreciate it if you were to visit him in England.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[I would therefore seek your support for my nomination on behalf of my constituency of Bootle.] I 
would further add that if I were to become successful in gaining nomination to be a member of the 
Conference Arrangements Committee I would fulfill my duties with fairness and diligence.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[Mr. Lloyd did not answer at once. It was hard to know where to begin: he knew so much about the 
place ... that the knowledge turned in unconnected fragments in his head.] “If you were to begin by 
describing the place?” — [“Yes. Yes, I will do my best to describe it.” — “Then you might go on to the 
people.”]  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
[I think that] under the circumstances it would be better if I were to drive you home.  (COB-W) 
However, this emphasis on improbability is not necessarily present. Sometimes there is no significant 
difference between ‘was / were to + present infinitive’ and the modal past. 
(418) 
a. 
What would you say if I {were to tell / told} you that Fred has divorced his wife? 
 
 
b. 
[Take a walk through the main square in Kuruvikulam and you will begin to understand the real 
meaning of the word barren. A handful of earth simply crumbles between your fingers and you have the 
feeling that] if you were to spill some water, it would disappear in an instant.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[“I’ve not had any accidents on er my current mountain bike.” — “Mm.” — “I have had accidents on 
my previous mountain bike but I’ve, I’ve never damaged a bike...” — “Right.” — “...at all.”] — “If, if 
you were to damage it would you try and fix it yourself or would you take it to the shop?” — “Erm if it 
was just like minor repair replacing a component I might do that myself but...” — “Mm.” — “if there 
was any structural damage then I’d definitely take it to the shop.”  (COB-S) (Note that ‘were to be’ 
cannot substitute for ‘was’ in the reply to the question. ‘Were to be’ is always extra-tentative. This may 

be suitable in a tentative question, but not in the reply to it: in replying to the question the speaker 
accepts the world evoked by the question, without expressing any doubt about it.) 
In section 5.7.3 we saw that, in a pattern 2 conditional, a P-clause with a stative verb phrase is normally 
interpreted as referring to the present, and hence as counterfactual. However, when such a stative P-clause 
uses ‘was / were to + present infinitive’, the speaker is usually referring to the post-present rather than to the 
present, so that the interpretation is not counterfactual but tentative: 
(419) 
a. 
If you were to be able to create a different mood ambience and atmosphere within those four walls and 
beneath that roof then it still may be the same number on the door in the street but the environment of 
the home is a very different er environment.  (COB-S)  (Compare: If you were able to... 
[=counterfactual].) 
 
 
b. 
It would be a boost to everyone at the club if he was to be fit for the Final.  (COB-S) 
 
 
c. 
She said she’d respect me more if I were to be a bit ruthless occasionally. 
 
 
d. 
[There is no precedent for a bank being withdrawn from liquidation, and many are saying that western 
bankers do not want BCCI to survive.] Even if that were to happen, BCCI’s reputation is irreparably 
tainted.  (COB-S: BBC) (Note the combination of the P-clause with ‘were to’ [expressing weak 
possibility in the post-present] with the closed Q-clause [referring to what is assumed to be a present 
fact].) 
In some cases the speaker refers to a post-present evaluation time, for example, to a time when the speaker’s 
belief about the present might turn out to be wrong: 
(420) 
(about addiction to alcohol)  [“I don’t think of it in terms of er people inheriting a predisposition for it.” — 
“Yeah.” — “I don’t see it as having a physiological component.] If it were to have any physiological 
component my guess would be, it would be, er, er, a tendency for some of us more than others to be 
obsessive about our thinking, er, [I do believe that some people more than others, er, somehow have...”]  
(COB-S) 
In generic (gnomic) or habitual sentences in the present tense, ‘was / were to + present infinitive’ refers to a 
P-situation that might actualize at any time in the unrestricted period including the temporal zero-point: 
(421) 
a. 
Kids—right—when they’re little—if you were to give them an apple here and one directly behind it, 
they draw them on top of each other. [And one of the signs that they’re growing up and learning about 
spatial awareness is where they actually put them behind each other.]  (COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
[If you are a man you can go along with feminist ideas until you are out with the boys and once again 
hear women discussed in a way] that would deeply hurt them if they were to overhear it. [You could 
listen to that stuff and not dare to raise a voice in protest. Well I don’t want to be too hard on anyone. 
The flesh is weak and we always long for acceptance and approval.]  (COB-S) 
When were to is followed by a perfect infinitive, it refers to a counterfactual past P-situation: 
(422) 
a. 
Were he to have objected to the plan, all hope of saving the company would have been lost. 
 
 
b. 
[The bone of contention is the level of the award, £10,000 so far and more to come.] Were he to have 
claimed in a civil court the amount would almost certainly be puny, [since he would have to prove 
damage to character and reputation. But all this was left to just one man—Sir David Calcutt, QC.]  
(COB-W) 
There are a further couple of things to be noted. Firstly, there appears to be some difference of register 
between tentative was to and were to, as well as a difference of frequency depending on whether the subject 
is in the first person singular or in the third person singular. (Second person subjects and plural subjects play 
no role, since they do not combine with was to.) The examples from the Cobuild corpus reveal that if I was to 
is not used in the highest registers but is about twice as frequent as if I were to in the more informal registers. 
By contrast, if s/he was to is 4.5 times as frequent as if s/he were to in the corpus, though it should be noted 
that all instances but one occur in the spoken data or quoted spoken data. 
Secondly, were to, but not was to, allows a construction with zero-connection i.e. without conditional 
conjunction) and subject-auxiliary inversion: 
(423) 
{Were / *was} he to suspect anything afterwards, he would no doubt start an investigation. 
In this (formal) construction (and similar ones involving inversion), not cannot be contracted: 
(424) 
a. 
Were he not to come...  (*Weren’t he to come...) 
 
 
b. 
Had he not been there...  (*Hadn’t he been...) 

Thirdly, unlike tentative-P conditionals, counterfactual-P conditionals of pattern 2 do not normally allow the 
use of ‘was / were to + infinitive’ instead of a modal past in the if-clause. 
(425) 
a. 
If I {knew / *were to know} his telephone number, I’d give it to you. 
 
 
b. 
Life would be easier for me if I {had / *were to have} a car. 
‘Were / was to + present infinitive’ as a rule expresses a tentative hypothesis, which means that P cannot be 
counterfactual. 
Fourthly, apart from the tentative use that we have been discussing, were to and was to can also express 
various other modal meanings—see section 6.4.3. 
 
6.4.2. Should in P-clauses 
 
In both spoken and written British English, should can be used in the P-clause of an open-P or tentative-P 
conditional to emphasize that the possibility of actualization of the P-situation depends on chance or on some 
other unpredictable factor. It renders the condition more tentative and is nearly always interchangeable with 
‘by any chance’. (Obviously, should is not interchangeable with ought to here, as it is in certain other uses, 
because ought to never has a ‘by any chance’ meaning.) 
(426) 
a. 
If this appliance should fail to work, we will replace it with another.  (open condition) (=‘If, by any 
chance, this appliance fails to work...’) 
 
 
b. 
Even if I should die tonight, seeing this mountain would have made the journey worthwhile.  (COB-W) 
(tentative-P conditional with anteriority in the Q-clause) (=‘Even if, by any chance, I died tonight...’) 
 
 
c. 
If the changes caused by the Greenhouse Effect should turn out to be as serious as many people think, 
emissions of all Greenhouse gases would have to be minimised.  (COB-W) (tentative condition) 
 
 
d. 
Should anyone phone, he must tell them to ring back later. 
Several remarks can be made here. Firstly, should can also be used in the P-clause when the conditional as a 
whole has a gnomic or habitual meaning and therefore refers to the (extended) present rather than to the post-
present. In that case the P-clause is not open or tentative, but neutral: 
(427) 
a. 
[It is routine and necessary to decide at an early stage after a patient is admitted] whether resuscitation 
should be attempted if their heart should stop.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
This equipment can be quite dangerous if inexperienced technicians should handle it.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
Right now if the police should nick you for anything and you can’t prove your identity, they put you in 
the cell until you can.  (COB-S) 
Should can also occasionally be found in the P-clause of a factual-Q conditional which implies the idea of 
repetition or habit in the past: 
(428) 
a. 
I was very willing to search for the truth if it should tend in the direction I wanted, [and I hated the 
search for it when everything seemed to point away. But I had to have the truth.]  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
And all the time the bank was charging me 4.5 per cent above the base rate for my overdraft, and £3.50 
a day if I should go so much as 1 p above my overdraft limit.  (COB-S) 
A second remark in connection with should is that it can be used with zero-connection i.e. without a 
conjunction) and subject-auxiliary inversion. As always, when there is inversion and the P-clause is negative, 
not cannot be contracted: 
(429) 
a. 
{Should she not / *shouldn’t she} be back by twelve, warn the police. 
 
 
b. 
Should you see her, will you convey my best regards to her? 
 
 
c. 
[Mr Lowry accepted that he could still seek an order for trial of a preliminary issue if a prompt 
application was made and] should he be successful he would not be joined in the plaintiff’s action.  
(COB-W) 
Although inversion is typical of a formal style, it may also occur in less formal (e.g. quoted, or ostensibly 
quoted, spoken) English: 
(430) 
[The 38-year old, who is Barry Fry’s assistant and top scorer at Third Division Peterborough, cheered: “I was 
absolutely thrilled when national boss Lawrie McMenemy invited me into the set-up. When Bryan Hamilton 
left the Irish job, several people asked me if I was interested.] I replied that should the Irish FA think I was 
the man for the job, then all well and good—but it didn’t materialise. [In retrospect I was just too young and 
didn’t possess sufficient experience.”]  (COB-W) 

A third remark on should is that its ‘by any chance’ meaning is sometimes used for purposes of politeness, 
euphemism or irony: 
(431) 
a. 
Whatever happens to you in the clinic is confidential and not told to anyone else even if they should 
enquire.  (COB-W) (euphemistic: a simple present tense, though perfectly possible, would have a slight 
pragmatic difference—implying rather more that it is a foreseen possibility that someone might enquire 
[and, by extrapolation, that such enquiries have been known to happen], which might frighten potential 
patients.) 
 
 
b. 
[Behind it was a narrow, dark corridor, more and still more books, a jar of orange marmalade, and a 
bubbling fragrance of coffee, the smell of freshly-sharpened pencils, of old and crackling paper.] If the 
New Building at St Pancras should ever open, the British Library’s Education Service will surely mourn 
the loss of its secret rabbit warren.  (COB-W) (This is an ironical use of ‘ever’ and ‘should’ [suggesting 
‘by any chance’], since the new building referred to was famously long in its building.) 
 
 
c. 
Should you have any questions or queries about Option 15, simply call our free Option 15 Helpline on 
0800 800 862 and we’ll be pleased to help you.  (COB-W) (This seems to be a politeness usage, 
probably because ‘should have’ just sounds more formal than ‘have’. The ‘by any chance’ meaning of 
‘should’ seems to be used for politeness, perhaps to distance the speaker slightly from making too 
personal a prediction of possibility regarding the addressee’s wishes, feelings etc.) 
In the same way, (432a) and (432b) may be considered a little more polite than (the not impolite) (432c) (and 
the slight formality associated with the inversion in (432a) will add to the politeness): 
(432) 
a. 
Should you require extra towels, please let the chambermaid know. 
 
 
b. 
If you should require extra towels, please let the chambermaid know. 
 
 
c. 
If you require extra towels, please let the chambermaid know. 
A fourth remark in connection with should is that it can be used after if, unless and in case, but not after 
conjunctions expressing a necessary condition (providing, on condition that, on the understanding that...): 
(433) 
a. 
She would be very upset {if / *providing / *on condition that} he should come while she’s out. 
 
 
b. 
I’m closing the windows in case there should be a storm while we’re away. 
 
 
c. 
[“We’re completely lost in this desert.” — “And there isn’t any water left.”] — “So, unless we should 
be found quickly, it’s only a matter of days before we die?” — [“I’m afraid so, yes.”] 
A fifth thing worth noting is that should is not backshifted in IRS, FIS or PR=AST: 
(434) 
a. 
If anyone should ask for me, you can tell them I am not in the office. 
 
 
b. 
She said that if anyone should ask for her, I could tell them she was not in the office. 
In fact, diachronically speaking should is a past tense, so that no further backshifting is possible. The form 
‘should + perfect infinitive’ exists, but its meaning is merely a combination of ‘by any chance’ with T-
anteriority: 
(435) 
[After endless hitches since the project’s inception, it has apparently finished on a high note. The probe 
gathered data and retransmitted it to Earth as planned.] Should Galileo have discovered little green men on 
Jupiter we’ll now have to wait to find out until Clinton and Gingrich settle their differences.  (COB-W) 
A sixth thing to notice is that, because only certain contexts are compatible with the idea ‘by any chance’, 
should is often not suitable in the if-clause: 
(436) 
a. 
Our army might gain greatly in striking power if the Government {purchased / ??should purchase} 
some of the latest fighting-planes. 
 
 
b. 
If he {spent / *should spend} more time looking after his family and less time going out, his marriage 
would be a lot happier.  (The P-situation does not depend on chance but on the will of the referent of the 
subject NP.) 
 
 
c. 
If I {do / (?)should} not get back at once, my husband will wonder what has happened to me.  (Though 
the P-situation may depend on chance, it is more likely to depend upon the speaker herself.) 
A seventh remark is that because of its ‘by any chance’ meaning, should cannot be used in counterfactual P-
clauses (which cannot have any uncertainty about the P-actualization): 
(437) 
a. 
I’d be happier (now) if I {had / *should have} a steady job. 
 
 
b. 
If I {knew / *should know} the truth I would tell you. 
 
 
c. 
If he {had been / *should have been} {here now / there at the time}, I would have asked him for help. 

On the other hand, should is not impossible in pattern 3 conditionals with an imaginary P-clause, especially 
in the pattern without if and with subject-auxiliary inversion: 
(438) 
a. 
[We were very confident and didn’t expect any real trouble.] Should anything have happened, we would 
certainly have been able to deal with it.  (FIS) 
 
 
b. 
[Fortunately, we didn’t see any soldiers, but] should we have seen any, we would certainly have left at 
once. 
 
 
c. 
It would have been easy to quiet his suspicions, should he have ever come.  (Jespersen 1932: 334) 
While a counterfactual P-clause cannot have any uncertainty about it (because counterfactual P implies #P in 
the actual world), an imaginary P-clause refers to a pure thought experiment, which has no truth relations 
with the actual world. Thus, in (438c) there seems to be a contextual past time t available at which someone 
(the speaker or someone else) was wondering whether the relevant person would come (at some time 
posterior to t, but also past). In other words, the epistemic stance of ‘by any chance’ is not located at current 
speech time but at the past reference time assumed in would have been. 
An eighth remark on should is that because of the semantic similarity between should and was / were to in 
tentative-P conditionals, examples can be found where the two occur in coordinate P-clauses: 
(439) 
If similar cases should arise, and if it were to be proved that the Lord Chancellor’s local advisory committee 
had failed in its duty to warn the magistrates concerned, then the magistrates would not be blamed for what 
had happened.  (COB-W) 
A ninth thing to note is that in a rather formal, or literary, style, should can be found in relative clauses with a 
conditional connotation: 
(440) 
a. 
Any spelling mistake you should have made has been corrected by the program itself. 
 
 
b. 
Anyone who should wish to take a shower can do so after supper. 
In such examples, the antecedent of the relative clause is normally an indefinite noun phrase or pronoun—in 
fact, nearly always a constituent beginning with any. Instances with a definite noun phrase as antecedent are 
quite literary and rather odd; and even then the must be more or less equivalent to any: 
(441) 
One can imagine what would have happened to the man who should have dared to tell the truth in this 
fashion.  (Jespersen 1932: 335) 
It is also worth noting that would too can occasionally be found in a conditional relative clause: 
(442) 
Who could have stolen it? ... most obviously, anyone at all who would happen to be passing and who had 
glimpsed, through the open door, a handbag that had proved too tempting an opportunity.  (TJT) 
It is probably the tentative meaning that renders would happen possible. Still, had happened would be the 
more normal form here. 
A tenth, and final, remark on should is that it is a different use of should that we find in examples like the 
following: 
(443) 
a. 
[Until recently the judiciary have accepted their very essential and skilled role as administrators of the 
law. They are not the law-makers.] It would be better if the roles hitherto filled should remain 
unchanged.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
It will be a great pity if Cannes should ever try to imitate her gayer less reputable cousin.  (COB-W) 
The conditionals here are of the ‘extraposed-P’ type (see section 11.13.1). This means that they are 
interpreted as follows: 
(444) 
a. 
If the roles hitherto filled should remain unchanged, it would be better that the roles hitherto filled 
should remain unchanged. 
 
 
b. 
If Cannes should try to imitate her gayer less reputable cousin, it will be a great pity that Cannes should 
try to imitate her gayer less reputable cousin. 
In these (redundant) paraphrases, the should which appears in the extraposed subject clause has a different 
meaning from the ‘by any chance’ should that appears in the P-clause. In (444a) it is the should which is 
quite common (in British English—American English normally uses the present subjunctive) after an 
expression of volition of necessity (as in It’s essential that we should stick together); in (444b) it is the so-
called ‘putative’ should which is often used (in British English) after an expression of personal opinion or 
value judgement (as in It’s surprising that he should say that). In (443a-b) the should in the if-clause appears 

to one of these two kinds of should rather than the ‘by any chance’ should typical of P-clauses. This accords 
with the fact that the present tense would have a different meaning in (443b): after an expression of personal 
opinion, the present tense conveys a factual meaning (e.g. It’s surprising that he says that); such a present 
tense form is not a PPS-form (referring to a possible post-present situation). 
 
6.4.3. Be to and be going to in P-clauses 
 
In neutral, closed and open P-clauses, be to and be going to can be used to express the idea that the future 
fulfilment of the condition is a goal that is striven for, i.e. to convey the meaning of purpose tinged with 
future contingency: 
(445) 
a. 
You have to work hard if you are to make it in this profession. 
 
 
b. 
If the lecturer is to be enthusiastic and convincing, he must believe in the skills; if the student is to try to 
use the skills effectively in both microteaching and subsequent school situations, he must have faith in 
them.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[But look, my lad.] If you’re going to make a success of this business, ...  (RTM) 
In IRS, FIS and PR=AST, backshifted forms are found: 
(446) 
a. 
[It was gradually realised that] if any permanent improvement was to be made, help needed to be given 
to eradicate poverty.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[It was six o’clock on a Friday evening, Friday, October 10th.] If he was going to do it he’d better start 
on the organization tomorrow.  (ADIMV) 
 
 
c. 
[The curator of the University of Queensland insect collection, Margaret Schneider, said yesterday the 
chances of eradicating the papaya fruit fly were slim.] She said speed and luck were needed if 
authorities were to have any chance of containing the pest.  (COB-W) 
In such examples, the past subjunctive form were (going) to can be found instead of was (going) to. (There is 
no register difference between this use of was to and were to.) 
(447) 
a. 
[Toni realized, as yet in a blurred sort of way, that] if he were to keep any sort of mental balance he 
must discipline his thoughts.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[He collected 125 signatures from Labour MPs for his motion and felt fairly confident that he would be 
successful. Nothing could be done before the summer recess, but] if he was to get his motion through in 
this Parliament before it went into the next election, it would have to be mentioned in the King’s 
Speech, [because it was reasonable to suppose that the election would interrupt business, probably as 
early as February.]  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[Evandar refused to unravel his own riddle, simply because he was Evandar and for no better reason at 
all. At times Jill wondered if she hated him, meddling with all their lives this way, but there was no 
doubt that] she needed his help if she were going to keep Carra and the child safe.  (COB-W) 
It should also be noted that in if-clauses, be going to can also be used as a future tense auxiliary implying a 
present intention or expectation concerning the post-present. Compare: 
(448) 
a. 
If I’m going to be in France anyway, I might as well pay a visit to Marie in Lille.  (closed condition; 
‘am going to’ expresses ‘present intention concerning the future’ and is not goal-oriented) 
 
 
b. 
If I’m going to be there by six, I’ll have to leave now.  (open or closed condition; ‘am going to’ is goal-
oriented) 
 
 
c. 
If I’m going to get a threatening letter every time I go a fraction overdrawn, I’m going to move my 
account to another bank.  (closed condition; ‘if I am going to...’ is interpreted as ‘If, as is apparently 
common practice in this bank, I am going to...’, and therefore expresses futurity; it is not goal-
oriented.) 
 
 
d. 
You must write about weighty topics if you are going to win the Prix Goncourt.  (ambiguous: [a] 
noninferential conditional: ‘are going to’ is goal-oriented and ‘must’ expresses nonepistemic necessity; 
[b] inferential conditional: ‘must’ expresses epistemic necessity and the P-clause is premise-
expressing: it means ‘if, as I accept, it is true that you are going to win the Prix Goncourt’, i.e. the 
addressee has prior knowledge of the award. This ambiguity is similar to that of ‘You must be mad to 
be a member of this club’. Here the noninferential reading is ‘Being mad is a necessary condition for 
being a member of this club’; the inferential reading is ‘If [as appears to be the case] you are a 
member of this club, I conclude from this that you must be mad’. To keep the two meanings apart, 
British speakers often use ‘have [got]’ to instead of ‘must’ for the former reading.) 
Similarly, be to can have its normal modal meaning of nonepistemic necessity or obligation: 

(449) 
I cannot be back home by eight if I am to drive all the way to Glasgow this afternoon.  (closed-P; ‘am to’ 
expresses nonepistemic necessity resulting from an order or arrangement) 
 
6.4.4. Verb forms after in case and lest 
 
In section 2.4 it was pointed out that, in case-specifying conditionals, the normal interpretations of in case 
are the ‘precautionary’ sense (e.g. She closed the door in case the stranger on her driveway was dangerous) 
and the ‘preclusive’ or ‘preventative’ sense (e.g. She took the child by the hand in case it ran away).34 In 
both senses, in case can always be followed by an indicative tense form. (If the Q-clause refers to the post-
present, the indicative tense form in question must be in the present tense rather than in the future tense. In 
technical terms—see section 5.1 above—it has to be a ‘Present Perspective System’-form, i.e. a nonmodal 
indicative relative tense form that is typically used in open P-clauses referring to the post-present, as in I will 
leave now in case your husband comes home early). However, the modal auxiliary should can also be used, 
especially in more formal English. In that case there is usually—around 90% of the examples in the Cobuild 
corpus—a sense of W-posteriority in the in case-clause: 
(450) 
a. 
This was for her protection, in case she should ever need to say how she had met him or come to know 
him.  (COB-W) (precautionary-P) 
 
 
b. 
She never let the child play in the street in case he should be run over.  (preclusive-P) 
However, there are also examples in which an in case-clause with should is interpreted in terms of W-
simultaneity rather than W-posteriority: 
(451) 
a. 
[“I’m Professor Dirke,”] Alistair said, in case there should be any mistake.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
The grateful indigent of the English Midlands will doubtless wave multi-starred European Union flags 
gratefully at any passing Volkswagen or Renault in case they should contain one of those stern but fair 
officials from Brussels.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
... where the furniture is screwed to the floor in case the clients should try to assault the interviewers 
with it.  (NW) (‘Is screwed to the floor’ is to be interpreted as ‘has been screwed to the floor’, i.e. as 
indicating a resultant state. ‘In case’ is read as precautionary: this state has been created in order to be 
prepared if clients should try to assault the interviewers with it.) 
 
 
d. 
Jim didn’t open the door in case it should be the bailiff.  (It is possible, however, that ‘should’ here 
imposes some kind of subjective W-posteriority on the ‘in case’-situation, i.e. that it profiles not so 
much the possibility that the person at the door may BE the bailiff as the idea that Jim does not open the 
door because he is afraid that if he does, the person who has knocked at the door will TURN OUT to be 
the bailiff. In other words, ‘should’ may be selected in order to put the ‘temporal focus’—see 5.1.11—
on a time W-posterior to that of the head clause.) 
The in case-clause can also use should have in order to express T-anteriority: 
(452) 
[I knew John would arrive while I was out.] I gave Samantha a spare key for him in case he should have 
forgotten his. 
Apart from should, another auxiliary that can be used in the in case-clause (in formal English) is might, 
which is harmonious with the meaning of in case in that it adds to the ‘possibility’ understanding. (The 
possibility expressed by might is ‘factual’ [=epistemic] possibility. That is, might can be paraphrased: ‘it is 
possible that...’ or ‘Perhaps...’. In other words, the speaker is talking about the chances that a situation will 
actualize, is actualizing or—with a perfect infinitive—has actualized.) 
(453) 
a. 
He immediately apologized for his clothes, in case he might make a bad impression on her. 
 
 
b. 
[How could I?] I couldn’t even bear to switch on the TV or the radio in case there might be something 
about it.  (DOC) 
In very formal English, lest can substitute for in case in its preclusive (preventative) sense (but not in its 
precautionary sense). Lest can be paraphrased: ‘so that...not’. It is most often followed by should, but the 
indicative, the present subjunctive and might are also possible: 
(454) 
a. 
They kept him prisoner in the barn lest he {notified / should notify} the police. 
                                              
34 Approximately 80% of the Cobuild examples are read as precautionary, 20% as preventative. 

 
 
b. 
[Hospitals have been allowed to form Trusts which are encouraged to compete with each other. I know 
of one hospital in London] which will not reveal its workload of patients terminally ill with Kidney 
disease, lest some other Trust might unfairly compete in the provision of this service.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
The fine for spitting has been increased tenfold, lest foreign visitors be offended.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
Marianne could not have known that Simon had not called her lest she hang up on him.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
Frank watched Leona take one of Ann’s aprons from a hook and put it on, lest she splash gravy on her 
dress.  (COB-W) 
 
 
f. 
It is particularly important for the male to keep other males away at that time, lest one nips in and take 
his place.  (COB-W) 
 
 
g. 
“I’m afraid it has been a long day,” I explained, lest he thought us rude.  (COB-W) 
 
6.5. Conclusion 
 
In this chapter we have examined the use of modal verb forms—the subjunctive and modal auxiliaries—in 
the P-clause or Q-clause of the various types of possible-world conditionals. We have distinguished between 
‘ordinary’ modals, which are also to be found in independent clauses and ‘special-P’ modals, which can only 
appear in P-clauses.

Chapter 7 
 
The three canonical tense patterns 
 
 
We have already referred to the three tense patterns of (case-specifying) conditionals that are traditionally 
distinguished by grammatical handbooks. We refer to these as the ‘canonical’ patterns (or: tense patterns) of 
conditional. 
 
Pattern 1: If she comes I will tell her everything. 
 
Pattern 2: If she came I would tell her everything. 
 
Pattern 3: If she had come I would have told her everything. 
As noted in chapter 5, there is a certain correlation between these formal patterns and the possible-world 
categories ‘open-P’, ‘tentative-P’ and ‘counterfactual-P’, respectively. However, this correlation is less 
perfect than much of the linguistic literature would have us believe. For example, we have already pointed 
out that pattern 2 conditionals are sometimes counterfactual-P rather than tentative-P. In this chapter we will 
explore the various meanings which conditionals of the three patterns can have. In doing so we will use the 
labels ‘pattern 1/2/3’ as indications of the forms of the conditionals only. 
 
7.1. Canonical pattern 1 conditionals 
 
A pattern 1 conditional has the form ‘P-clause in the present tense + Q-clause in the future tense’, and is 
normally defined as involving a P-clause expressing an ‘open condition’ concerning the post-present, i.e. a 
condition whose fulfilment is uncertain, but is seen as a real possibility: 
(455) 
a. 
If she comes I’ll be happy. 
 
 
b. 
You’ll be in the obituary columns if you don’t soon pack up smoking.  (DOC) 
However, there are open-P conditionals that do not belong to type 1, and there are pattern 1 conditionals that 
are not open-P. It follows that several remarks are in order here. Firstly, both clauses allow the expression of 
T-anteriority. The P-clause does so by using the present perfect, the Q-clause by using the future perfect: 
(456) 
a. 
And if you’ve not turned up by then, I’ll just take a taxi up to your place.  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
If you haven’t arrived there by ten, he will have eaten your supper as well as his own. 
These examples show that conditionals with what is traditionally defined as pattern 1 meaning (=open 
condition concerning the post-present) need not actually have the verb forms typical of pattern 1. 
In IRS, FIS and PR=AST, the verb forms are backshifted: 
(457) 
a. 
[She replied that] he would be in the obituary columns if he didn’t soon pack up smoking.  (IRS; no T-
anteriority expressed) 
 
 
b. 
He said that if I hadn’t finished the work before the end of the week he would refuse to pay me.  (IRS; 
T-anteriority in the P-clause) 
 
 
c. 
If the squatters hadn’t left before Christmas, they would be removed from the building by force.  (FIS or 
PR=AST; T-anteriority in the P-clause) 
 
 
d. 
[I knew that] if I hadn’t arrived there by ten, he would have eaten my supper as well as his own.  (IRS; 
T-anteriority in both clauses) 
Open conditionals that express T-anteriority or have been backshifted (or both) do not have the outward form 
of pattern 1 conditionals. Unless stated otherwise, we will not be referring to them when applying the label 
‘pattern 1’. 
Secondly, conditionals of (the form of) pattern 1 do not always yield an open-P interpretation. In the 
following examples the P-clause in the present tense expresses a neutral or closed supposition about the 
present. 
(458) 
a. 
(from brochure)  If you are unemployed you will want to find a job as fast as possible.  (COB-W) 
(neutral-P: the speaker addresses a nonspecific hearer—see 4.2.2.1.) 
 
 
b. 
[Some of the waves are fifteen feet high;] if they catch a boat sideways, they will flip it like a pancake.  
(COB-W) (neutral-P: gnomic statement—see 4.2.2.2.) 
 
 
c. 
If (as you say) someone is coming to our front door, it will no doubt be the milkman.  (closed-P) 

 
217 
 
 
d. 
[It’s a relief to hear that.] If he collects stamps, he’ll be a quiet sort of chap.  (closed-P) 
It is worth noting that the neutral P-clauses in (458a-b) are ‘purely case-specifying’ (see sections 3.8.1 and 
9.3), while the closed P-clauses in (458c-d) express the premise of an inferential conditional. This difference 
triggers a slightly different interpretation of the predictability expressed by will. In (458a-b) the predictability 
of will seems to be more ‘objective’ than in (458c-d), where it is more ‘subjective’. That is, in (458c-d) Q is a 
conclusion drawn by the current speaker in the here-and-now of the ongoing discourse, while (458a-b) refer, 
rather, to a kind of general rule. 
Apart from pattern 1 examples like (458a-d), in which the P-clause is neutral or closed, there are also 
pattern 1 conditionals which refer to a counterfactual or highly unlikely P-world. This is the case in some 
pattern 1 conditionals of the ‘ad absurdum’ type. Compare: 
(459) 
a. 
Pigs will fly if that rumour is true. 
 
 
b. 
If she manages to do that, I’ll eat my hat. 
These conditionals are interpreted as counterfactual-P and tentative-P, respectively. The condition is 
ostensibly presented as closed or open, respectively, but once it is seen that the speaker treats Q, and 
therefore P, as impossible or highly unlikely, it is pragmatically clear that the condition is to be interpreted as 
either counterfactual, as in (459a), or as ‘expected to prove counterfactual’, i.e. as highly unlikely 
(=tentative), as in (459b). 
A third remark on pattern 1 conditionals is that the Q-clause sometimes uses modal (volitional) will rather 
than the future tense. This possibility is illustrated by the following: 
(460) 
a. 
If you ask him to help you, he will do it.  (‘Will’ expresses willingness on the reading ‘Whenever you 
ask him to help you, he’s willing to do it.’) (open-P) 
 
 
b. 
If you ask him questions about his former wife, he just won’t answer.  (refusal) (open-P or neutral-P) 
 
 
c. 
If he sees a chance of playing truant, he WILL do it.  (obstinate insistence) (neutral-P) 
 
7.2. Canonical pattern 2 conditionals 
 
A ‘pattern 2 conditional’ has the form ‘P-clause in the past tense + Q-clause in the conditional tense’ and is 
normally defined as involving a tentative-P condition concerning the post-present actualization of the P-
situation (If she came I’d be happy).1 
However, if we look on the one hand at tentative-P conditionals, and on the other hand at conditionals 
with pattern 2 verb forms, we find that this description is again too simple. For one thing, a pattern 2 
tentative P-clause need not always express post-present actualization. The P-actualization may also be 
located in the present (e.g. I’d be surprised if that man over there was a teacher) or the past (e.g. I’d be 
surprised if he was there yesterday). For another, there are a number of exceptions to the correlation between 
a tentative-P meaning and pattern 2 verb forms. That is, sometimes we have tentative meaning expressed by 
verb forms that do not match pattern 2, and sometimes we have pattern 2 verb forms, but not tentative 
meaning. 
 
7.2.1. Tentative-P conditionals that do not have the pattern 2 form 
 
In a tentative-P conditional, the verb form of the P-clause and/or the Q-clause may deviate from that of a 
canonical pattern 2 conditional. A first case is when the P-clause uses the past subjunctive were instead of the 
past tense form was—see section 6.1.2—or when it uses ‘{was / were} to + infinitive’ instead of the past 
tense (e.g. I’d be surprised if he {was / were / was to be / were to be} elected President)—see section 6.4.1. 
(However, a pattern 2 conditional with was or were in the if-clause receives a tentative-P interpretation only 
if it is clear that the reference is to the post-present, not to the present. Thus, out of context, If I {was / were} 
a rich man, I wouldn’t have to work is interpreted as a counterfactual-P conditional.) 
A second case in which the verb form of a tentative P-clause deviates from that of the canonical pattern 2 
is when the tentative P-clause uses the past perfect in order to express T-anteriority: 
(461) 
I wouldn’t be surprised if you’d just washed your pills down with a pint.  (DOC) 
                                              
1 
What we call tentative-P pattern 2 conditionals are often said to express ‘unreality’ (whereas pattern 3 conditionals express 
‘counterfactuality’). Since we distinguish between ‘tentative’ and ‘irrealis’, and since a pattern 2 conditional can have either of 
these meanings, we will not follow this convention. 

 
218 
Such a past perfect form does not have a counterfactual meaning. It differs from the past tense only in that it 
expresses T-anteriority. In other words, such sentences blend a pattern 3 P-clause with a pattern 2 Q-clause, 
but retain an overall tentative meaning. 
The Q-clause, too, may express T-anteriority (by means of the conditional perfect). In that case the 
conditional blends a pattern 2 P-clause with a pattern 3 Q-clause, but again retains an overall tentative 
meaning: 
(462) 
[It might be better if you came later in the evening.] If you came, say, at eight, we would have finished eating 
and you’d have our full attention. 
It should be noted, however, that a tentative interpretation of a Q-clause in the conditional perfect is 
exceptional: it arises only if it is called for by the context. The counterfactual interpretation is usually more 
accessible, as in the following examples: 
(463) 
a. 
[A very large number of parents have expressed their support for the family. One told me,] “If I thought 
there was any truth in the allegation I would have withdrawn my child from the school.”  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
But if it was as good as he seemed to think, surely there would have been other bidders.  (COB-W) 
A third case in which the verb form of a tentative P-clause deviates from that of the canonical pattern 2 is 
when the Q-clause uses might or could instead of should / would. In a nonliterary register, the auxiliary might 
usually expresses ‘factual’ (=epistemic) possibility (except in requests like Might I join you?) Could can 
express either factual or ‘theoretical’ (=nonepistemic) possibility, as well as ability or permission. The terms 
‘theoretical possibility’ and ‘factual possibility’ are due to Leech (1971). ‘Factual possibility’ is typically 
expressed by may and can be paraphrased as ‘it is possible that...’ or ‘perhaps’. In other words, the speaker is 
talking about the chances that a situation will actualize, is actualizing or (with a perfect infinitive) has 
actualized. ‘Theoretical possibility’, by contrast, is typically expressed by can (which can also express ability 
or permission): here the speaker just expresses that it is theoretically possible (conceivable) for some 
situation to actualize; it does not refer to any actual instances of actualization—e.g. Aerosols can explode if 
they get too hot. The suitable paraphrase here is with possible (for...) to (e.g. It is possible for aerosols to 
explode if they get too hot). 
(464) 
a. 
If the enemy attacked, the bridge might be blown up.  (factual possibility: ‘might’=‘would perhaps’) 
 
 
b. 
If the enemy attacked, the bridge could be blown up.  (theoretical or factual possibility: ‘could’=‘it 
would be possible to...’ or ‘would perhaps’) 
 
 
c. 
If you stepped aside, I could enter the lift.  (‘could’=‘would be able to’) 
 
 
d. 
If you were a member of the board, you could attend these meetings.  (‘could’=‘would be allowed to’) 
 
7.2.2. Nontentative-P pattern 2 conditionals 
 
In section 7.2.1 we have discussed three cases in which a conditional has a tentative-P meaning but involves 
a verb form (in the P- or Q-clause) which is not typical of the canonical pattern 2. We will now have a look 
at some cases in which the conditional does have the form of the canonical pattern 2 but does not express a 
tentative-P meaning. 
 
7.2.2.1. Pattern 2 as a result of backshifting pattern 1 
 
A first possibility is that the pattern 2 conditional is the result of backshifting a factual-P, neutral-P, closed-P 
or open-P conditional of pattern 1. This is possible in indirect reported speech / thought (IRS),2 free indirect 
speech / thought (FIS), and in stories or novels that are narrated or written in the past tense (i.e. where the 
‘present’ of the story or novel is described in the past tense—a conventionalized system which we refer to as 
‘PR=AST’). (Backshifting can also be done in order to create an imaginary interpretation. This possibility is 
discussed in section 7.2.2.4 below.) Compare: 
(465) 
a. 
[“I think the murder was committed by the Secret Service.” — “Hmm.] If so, there will be a cover-up.”  
(direct speech; open or closed condition; ‘will’ expresses a present expectation concerning the future.) 
                                              
2 
Remember that reported speech may be ‘indirect’ (IRS) (e.g. He said he was ill) or ‘direct’ (DRS) (e.g. He said, “I am ill.”) 

 
219 
 
 
b. 
[The sergeant said he thought the murder had been committed by the Secret Service. The inspector 
replied that] if that was true, there would be a cover-up.  (IRS; open or closed condition; ‘would’ 
expresses a past expectation.) 
 
 
c. 
[I wasn’t sure the murderer would ever be caught.] If the murder had been committed by the Secret 
Service, there would be a cover-up.  (FIS; open or closed condition; ‘would’ expresses a past 
expectation.) 
(466) 
a. 
[When she saw the postman arrive she thought that] if the postman was already there, she would 
probably be late for work again.  (IRS; closed condition; ‘would’ expresses a past expectation.) 
 
 
b. 
William would be thrown out of the house if he got behind with paying the rent. (FIS; open condition; 
‘would’ expresses a past expectation.) 
The only (relevant) difference between (465a) and the other inferential examples—(465b-c) and (466a)—is 
the time—present or past—when the inference from P to Q is made. The verb forms in the latter examples 
are those of canonical pattern 2 conditionals. 
Similarly: 
(467) 
a. 
If he is the murderer, he will try to escape to another country.  (direct speech; open or closed condition; 
‘will’ expresses present expectation.) 
 
 
b. 
[We realized that] if he was the murderer, he would try to escape to another country.  (IRS; open or 
closed condition; ‘would’ expresses past expectation.) 
 
 
c. 
If he was the murderer, he would try to escape to another country.  (FIS; open or closed condition; 
‘would’ expresses past expectation.) 
The following are further examples of open-P or closed-P conditionals that are backshifted in IRS or FIS: 
(468) 
a. 
[She realized that] if he found her, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill her.  (IRS; either reported [and hence 
backshifted] open-P conditional or reported [but nonbackshifted] tentative-P conditional) 
 
 
b. 
[She was very frightened.] If he found her, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill her.  (FIS version of an open-P 
or tentative-P conditional) 
 
 
c. 
[He said] if I told you about what he’d done he’d tell you about what I’d done.  (DOC) (IRS; 
backshifted open-P conditional) 
 
 
d. 
(from a novel:)  [Mildred had a contract stipulating that] she would have to pay legal costs if she lost a 
dispute.  (PR=AST with backshifted open-P conditional) 
When a factual-P, neutral-P, open-P or closed-P conditional that has the form of pattern 1 is given a past 
viewpoint in IRS, FIS or PR=AST, the resulting conditional has the form of pattern 2. As in pattern 2 
conditionals generally, the P-clause can then use the past subjunctive instead of the past tense, except when 
the backshifted conditional is a factual-P or closed-P conditional:3 
(469) 
a. 
[I checked that he had someone to talk to and he said that he had,] he always went to his grandmother if 
he {was / *were} unhappy.  (backshifted factual-P conditional) 
 
 
b. 
[When she saw the postman arrive she thought that] if the postman {was / *were} already there, she 
would probably be late for work again.  (backshifted closed-P) 
 
 
c. 
[She knew] Tim wouldn’t like it if she {was / were} at the party too.  (backshifted open-P) 
 
 
d. 
[She no longer had much confidence in the powers of the Almighty; but she almost felt herself praying. 
But if she were going to target any prayer, she could surely so easily find a better aim (or was it an 
‘objective’?) than averting a cacophonic chorus from 5C, for example. And in any case, 5C weren’t all 
that bad, really. ... No.] If she were going to pray for anything, it would be for something that was of far 
greater importance.  (DOC) (backshifted version of the open-P conditional ‘If I am going to pray for 
anything, it will be for...’) 
In backshifted factual-P, neutral-P, closed-P or open-P conditionals, the past tense of be going to can be used 
instead of would in the Q-clause (in the same way as the present tense of be going to alternates with will in 
the Q-clause of the corresponding conditional referring to the present): 
(470) 
a. 
[When she saw the postman arrive she thought that] if the postman was already there, she was probably 
going to be late for work again.  (backshifted closed-P) 
 
 
b. 
[He looked across now at the faithful little lady sitting there in her skirt and summer blouse next to her 
husband.] If she persisted in her present lies ... it was going to be extremely difficult to discredit her 
                                              
3 
Some writers, like Collin Dexter, appear to have a preference for using the subjunctive. In their novels, were can be found even 
in backshifted closed-P conditionals: 
 
(i) 
[“Maximum mental energy” had never been Kevin’s strong point.] But if such mighty exertion were required to win his 
way through to such a person, well, for once he would put his mind to things.  (DOC) (PR=AST: backshifted closed-P) 

 
220 
testimony, [appearing, as she did, to possess that formidable combination of nervousness and 
innocence].  (DOC) (backshifted open-P) 
The main point argued in this section has been that in IRS, FIS and PR=AST, the structure ‘P-clause in the 
past tense + Q-clause in the conditional tense’ may be a ‘backshifted’ factual-P, neutral-P, closed-P or open-
P conditional. This need not mean, however, that a pattern 2 conditional in IRS, FIS or PR=AST cannot be 
the report of a tentative-P conditional. Since pattern 2 conditionals with a tentative meaning are not 
backshifted in IRS, etc. (because backshifting would produce a pattern 3 conditional and thus normally 
change the meaning from tentative-P to counterfactual-P), a pattern 2 conditional may also be the IRS, FIS or 
PR=AST version of a tentative-P conditional. Thus, [He said that] if he found the answer he would tell me 
may be the IRS report of either If I find the answer, I will tell you or of If I found the answer, I would tell you. 
The following is similarly ambiguous: 
(471) 
[Haines, architect for the developers, said the building proposed would be of seven storeys with provision for 
a car park.] If shops were incorporated in the development they would be small and spoil the building both 
architecturally and economically.  (LOB) (FIS of either ‘if shops are...will’ or ‘if shops were...would’) 
 
7.2.2.2. Pattern 2 with counterfactual P and counterfactual Q 
 
Next to nontentative-P pattern 2 conditionals which are the result of backshifting pattern 1 conditionals, there 
are also pattern 2 conditionals expressing a counterfactual condition about the present. These represent a 
second type of nontentative-P pattern 2 conditionals. As a rule, a pattern 2 conditional is counterfactual-P if 
the P-clause is interpreted as referring to present rather than post-present actualization. This is the case when 
the P-situation is represented as homogeneous. (A situation is homogeneous if it is “the same all the way 
through” [Galton 1984: 154], i.e. if the clause describing the situation as a whole can also be used to describe 
parts of that situation, e.g. She drank water.) In other words, if a pattern 2 P-clause refers to a state or to a 
general or habitual situation, or if it uses a progressive verb form,4 it normally receives a present 
actualization interpretation. Otherwise, i.e. if the reading is at the same time semelfactive (=nonrepetitive), 
nonstatic (=dynamic) and nonprogressive, the P-clause is interpreted as referring to future actualization.5 
The P-proposition is normally interpreted (by implicature—see immediately below) as counterfactual if there 
is reference to present actualization, and as tentative if the reference is to future actualization. For example: 
(472) 
a. 
You wouldn’t be here if you were waiting for her.  (P-verb with progressive meaning, hence reference 
to present actualization, hence counterfactual interpretation of P) 
 
 
b. 
She would be thankful if you waited for her.  (nonprogressive nonstative P-verb, hence interpreted as 
referring to future actualization, hence tentative interpretation of P) 
 
 
c. 
[“Must be short-staffed—that’s the only reason she rung.” — “You’d have thought people would be 
glad of a job like that, with all this unemployment.”] — “Would be, wouldn’t they, if they paid you 
decent bloody rates?”  (DOC) (habitual / gnomic P-interpretation, hence reference to the present, hence 
counterfactual interpretation of P) 
 
 
d. 
If I had a planet, one of my own, I would not allow the wheel to be introduced.  (COB-W) 
(counterfactual reading of P if the P-situation is interpreted as a present state) 
 
 
e. 
I wouldn’t be helping you if it weren’t for the sake of the children.  (counterfactual interpretation of P 
because the P-situation is a present state) 
 
 
f. 
We would think better of her if she came here herself.  (The interpretation of the P-clause is 
counterfactual if the P-situation is interpreted as a present habit.) 
 
 
g. 
If burning colas could sing, they’d sound like Guy Keyser.  (COB-W) (P concerns a state—the state of 
being able to sing—hence there is a counterfactual present interpretation of the P-clause.) 
 
 
h. 
I would appreciate it if she typed out this report for me.  (P is nonhabitual, nonstatic and 
nonprogressive, hence the P-clause receives a tentative post-present interpretation.) 
                                              
4 
These three features (habitual, static and progressive) are often subsumed under the label ‘stative’, but there are problems with 
this practice. For one thing, not all states (static situations) are described by stative verbs (i.e. verbs that cannot be used in the 
progressive or in the imperative form, and which cannot be replaced by do in pseudo-clefts like What I did was {wait for help / 
*know the answer}): verbs such as stand, hang, lie, sleep, wait, live, etc. are nonstative but refer to states. For another, 
progressive aspect is typically compatible with nonstative verb phrases, not with stative ones. 
5 
Iatridou (2000: 250) oversimplifies matters when she says that pattern 2 conditionals refer to the future if the P-clause contains 
“a telic predicate (e.g. drink the syrup).” In many examples (e.g. I would feel more comfortable if you wore black for the 
funeral tomorrow or It’d be better if you didn’t use your own car for the hold-up) the predicate is atelic (i.e. it does not 
represent the situation as tending towards a natural point of completion). 

 
221 
These examples are in keeping with the above two claims that (a) the P-clause of a pattern 2 conditional 
normally refers to present actualization if it represents its situation as homogeneous (i.e. if it refers to a state 
or habit, or uses a verb form with progressive meaning), and (b) the P-proposition is normally interpreted as 
counterfactual if it refers to present actualization, and as tentative if the reference is to post-present 
actualization. However, both these claims actually only represent implicatures. Both can be blocked or 
cancelled by the linguistic or extralinguistic context. For example, the mere addition of a future time 
adverbial is sufficient to block the former implicature (viz. that the P-clause of a pattern 2 conditional refers 
to present actualization if it represents its situation as homogeneous, i.e. if it refers to a state or habit, or uses 
a progressive verb form). Compare: 
(473) 
a. 
If I were a rich man, I wouldn’t have to work.  (stative P-verb, interpreted as referring to present 
actualization, hence as counterfactual) 
 
 
b. 
If I were suddenly rich tomorrow, I wouldn’t have to work (any more).  (Because of ‘suddenly’, the P-
clause refers to a punctual event, not to a state; because of this it is interpreted as referring to post-
present actualization, hence as tentative) 
(474) 
a. 
If you were working in Paris, it would be easier for us to come and visit you.  (P referring to present 
actualization, hence counterfactual) 
 
 
b. 
[I know you’d rather take the Berlin job than the Paris one, but] if you were working in Paris next 
summer, it would be easier for us to come and visit you.  (P interpreted as referring to future 
actualization, hence as tentative) 
In the following examples too, P is interpreted as referring to future actualization, and hence as tentative: 
(475) 
a. 
You might get a chance of seeing her if you {were / were working} in the garden tomorrow. 
 
 
b. 
You would soon feel fitter if in future you walked to work instead of driving there. 
 
 
c. 
If ever Brenda Brooks could begin to contemplate the murder of her husband, she would surely 
acknowledge as her primary, her abiding motive, the ways in which mentally and verbally he had so 
cruelly abused her for so long.  (DOC) (The future time reference is clear from ‘ever’ and ‘begin’.) 
In sentences like (473b), (474b) and (475a-c), the implicature that the P-clause of a pattern 2 conditional 
refers to present actualization if it represents the situation as homogeneous (i.e. if it refers to a state or habit, 
or uses a verb form with progressive meaning) does not arise because of the presence of an adverbial 
specifying a future time. By contrast, the implicature goes through in (472a-h), which do not contain such an 
adverbial. The origin of the implicature is the Gricean Maxim of Relation (relevance): reference to the 
present (=the temporal zero-point) is more relevant than reference to the post-present (or to the past); a tense 
form appearing in a construction in which it can in principle receive either a present or a post-present 
interpretation will therefore receive the present interpretation, unless there is an indication to the contrary. 
The second implicature (viz. that a pattern 2 P-clause is interpreted as counterfactual if it refers to present 
actualization) is again due to the Gricean Maxim of Relevance. Given the fact that factual present situations 
must be referred to in the present tense, the use of another tense to refer to the present must be motivated. 
The relevance of (i.e. motivation for) not using the present tense is that the situation is not factual: the use of 
the past tense with present time reference is a conventionalized way of representing a present situation as 
counterfactual. 
This second implicature can be blocked by factors inducing an imaginary-P interpretation—see sections 
3.11 and 4.2.2.7—by the context, or by the meaning of a particular constituent of the Q-clause: 
(476) 
a. 
[“It’s unlikely, but she might even be earning more than I am.”] — “If that were the case, it would be 
downright outrageous. [You work twice as hard as her.”]  (The preceding context imposes a tentative-P 
reading on the conditional.) 
 
 
b. 
I’d be very surprised if her present salary {was / were} higher than mine.  (The meaning of the Q-clause 
is incompatible with a counterfactual reading of the P-clause.) 
There are a couple of further things to be noted here. Firstly, like tentative-P conditionals, counterfactual-P 
pattern 2 conditionals allow the use of the subjunctive form were instead of the modal past form was in the 
if-clause—see section 6.1.2. 
(477) 
a. 
If it weren’t for our help, you’d be in trouble.  (Like the P-clause, the Q-clause is interpreted as 
counterfactual: it implies that the hearer is not in trouble.) 
 
 
b. 
If I were the manager, I’d be embarrassed about the level of service that we offer to the customer.  
(counterfactual P-clause + imaginary [and thus neutral] Q-clause; the Q-clause does not imply that the 
speaker isn’t embarrassed.) 

 
222 
 
 
c. 
If Bill {was / were} here, he would say the same thing. 
 
 
d. 
If it {was / were} not for the fact that he is older and bigger than me, I would smash him.  (or: {Were / 
*was} it not for the fact that...) 
 
 
e. 
If I were you, I wouldn’t answer any telephone calls. 
Secondly, apart from pattern 2 conditionals with a counterfactual P-clause triggering an irrealis 
(=counterfactual or imaginary) interpretation of Q, there are also pattern 2 conditionals in which the opposite 
triggering process is to be observed. This is the case in pattern 2 conditionals that receive an ‘indirect 
inferential’ reading (see sections 3.6.2 and 9.2.7). For example: 
(478) 
[In our next episode, a giant octopus threatens to destroy Gotham City.] But Superman wouldn’t be 
Superman if he didn’t solve that problem [as he’s solved so many others. Tune in next week to find out how 
he does it.]  (counterfactual indirect inferential: the counterfactuality of Q—which is pragmatically clear—
imposes a counterfactual reading of P.) 
Thirdly, the tentative interpretation which is normally given to the P-clause of a pattern 2 conditional 
referring to post-present P-actualization can be turned into a counterfactual one by the context. Compare: 
(479) 
a. 
It wouldn’t be a problem if he came the day after tomorrow.  (tentative-P reading) 
 
 
b. 
“[What a pity Ned arrives today.” — “Yes.] It wouldn’t be a problem if he came the day after 
tomorrow, [Then we would have finished decorating his room before he came].”  (counterfactual-P 
reading) 
In (479b), the context sees to it that P receives a counterfactual interpretation (‘Ned does not arrive 
tomorrow, and that is a problem’). Because of this, (479b) could be replaced with a pattern 3 conditional, 
which also receives a counterfactual-P reading: 
(479) 
b’. 
[What a pity Ned arrives today.] It would’ve been better if he’d arrived tomorrow. [Then we would’ve 
finished decorating his room before he came]. 
Fourthly, we have seen that a pattern 2 conditional that is interpreted counterfactually has present 
(actualization-)time reference in the P-clause and either present or post-present (actualization-)time reference 
in the Q-clause. However, the Q-clause can also refer to the past, in which case it uses the conditional 
perfect. Compare: 
(480) 
a. 
If I were a priest, I wouldn’t be here today. 
 
 
b. 
If I were a priest, I wouldn’t go there tomorrow. 
 
 
c. 
If I were a priest, I would have left here by now.  (The Q-clause expresses T-anteriority to the moment 
of speech, i.e. past time reference.) 
 
 
d. 
If I were a priest, I wouldn’t have gone there yesterday.  (id.) 
The latter two examples (in which both P and Q are counterfactual) are actually a blending of a pattern 2 P-
clause with a pattern 3 Q-clause. 
 
7.2.2.3. Pattern 2 with counterfactual P and imaginary Q 
 
When the P-clause is interpreted as counterfactual, it creates an irrealis world in which the Q-proposition 
may be interpreted not only as counterfactual but also as ‘imaginary’ (see sections 3.11 and 4.2.2.7). If Q is 
interpreted as counterfactual, the Q-proposition is taken to be false in the actual world or presumed to be 
false in a post-present world. If Q is interpreted as imaginary, nothing whatever is implied or implicated 
concerning the truth relation between the imaginary Q-world and the real world. The two possibilities are 
illustrated by (481a) and (481b-c), respectively: 
(481) 
a. 
I would {know / have known} the answer if you had told me.  (counterfactual P + counterfactual Q) 
 
 
b. 
If I had your genes, I would have curly hair.  (counterfactual P; imaginary Q: I may or may not have 
curly hair) 
 
 
c. 
If I’d had your genes, I would’ve had curly hair.  (id.) 
As will be argued in section 13.3, the two readings have different consequences for the use of unless: on the 
counterfactual reading, a P-clause introduced by unless means ‘If it {weren’t / hadn’t been} the case that’ or 
‘If it {weren’t / hadn’t been} for the fact that’; by contrast, an unless-clause has its normal ‘except if’ 
meaning when it is used with a counterfactual-P conditional with an imaginary Q-proposition: 

 
223 
(482) 
a. 
Unless you had told me I would never have known the answer.  (counterfactual P + counterfactual Q: 
‘unless you had told me’=‘If it weren’t for the fact that you had told me’) 
 
 
b. 
If I had your genes, I would have curly hair, unless I had it straightened by my hairdresser.  
(counterfactual P; imaginary Q [I may or may not have curly hair]; in the added ‘unless’-clause, 
‘unless’ has its unmarked ‘except if’ meaning) 
It should be noted that when an unless-clause is interpreted as ‘if it weren’t for the fact that...’, as in (482a), 
the negation following from counterfactuality and the negation implicit in unless neutralize each other, so 
that the interpretation of the (positive or negative)  unless-clause is such that its polarity is retained (i.e. not 
reversed by counterfactuality). That is, in counterfactual unless-clauses, ‘#[+p]’ is interpreted as [+p] rather 
than as [-p], and ‘#[-p]’ is read as [-p] rather than as [+p]: 
(483) 
a. 
John wouldn’t come to me for help unless I was his best friend.  (implies that I am his best friend) 
 
 
b. 
John wouldn’t come to me for help unless I didn’t judge him.  (implies that I don’t judge him) 
 
7.2.2.4. Pattern 2 with imaginary P and imaginary Q 
 
In some pattern 2 conditionals, not only the Q-clause but also the P-clause has an imaginary meaning. This 
means that the whole conditional expresses a pure thought experiment, without implying anything about the 
truth relations of P and Q with the actual world. The reference may be to the present or to the post-present. 
As in counterfactual pattern 2 conditionals, anteriority can be expressed by a perfect infinitive. 
(484) 
a. 
[“I wonder if he is talking to Julie?” — “He is always talking to Julie.” — “But she might be busy 
today.] Would he be talking to her if she were busy?”  (Both clauses refer to imaginary present 
actualization.) 
 
 
b. 
[I’ll have a look in the library, because] if he were there it would save us a lot of trouble.  (Both clauses 
refer to imaginary post-present actualization.) 
 
 
c. 
[“I don’t believe for a second he’s the one who did it.” — “Yes, but it does look suspicious that he 
disappeared.] Would he have run away if he were innocent?”  (Both situations are represented as 
imaginary. The Q-situation is represented as T-anterior to the present P-situation.) 
 
 
d. 
If there were any drugs on his staff he’d know about them, [so why don’t you ask him?] 
 
 
e. 
“Would you tell anyone?”, she asked. He hesitated. “Only if it were someone you loved.”  [adapted 
from DOC] 
 
 
f. 
In your place I wouldn’t answer that question if it were put to me. 
In some cases a pattern 1 conditional is backshifted in order to give it an imaginary meaning. Compare: 
(485) 
a. 
[“John’s suffering from nausea. Does he have the disease you were talking about?” — “Quite possibly.] 
He will indeed be suffering from nausea if he has the disease in question.” 
 
 
b. 
[“John’s suffering from nausea. Does he have the disease you were talking about?” — “Quite possibly.] 
He would indeed be suffering from nausea if he had the disease in question.” 
Sentence (485b) is the backshifted version of (485a). Clearly, this backshifting is not done in order to 
represent the present P-situation as counterfactual: (485b) is obviously not counterfactual. The motivation for 
the backshifting is the wish to represent the conditional as forming part of a purely hypothetical (=imaginary) 
scenario. Thus, (485b) is interpreted as ‘In a purely hypothetical scenario in which John was suffering from 
disease A, it is predictable that he would be suffering from nausea.’ 
It is interesting to see that presenting predictability as imaginary can be used in one context to argue for 
the truth of P and in another to argue for the falsity of P. This explains the following examples from 
Edgington (1997: 99): 
(486) 
a. 
(looking at a white liquid)  [I think this is milk.] If it were milk, it would be white (and it is). 
 
 
b. 
(looking at a blue liquid)  [I don’t think this is milk.] If it were milk, it would be white (and it is not). 
In both cases the reasoning is based on the argument that the imaginary hypothesis [+p] (=‘this be milk’) 
turns out to be true in the actual world only if Q is true in that world. 
Similarly: 
(487) 
a. 
[“Ted has declared he wasn’t in town at the time of the crime”.] — “That’s what he would say if he was 
the murderer.” 
 
 
b. 
[“Ted has declared he was in town at the time of the crime.”] — “That’s what he would say if he was 
the murderer.” 

 
224 
In (487a) the reasoning is as follows: ‘It is natural that a murderer denies committing the crime; so the fact 
that Ted maintains that he was not in town at the time is consistent with the hypothesis that he is the 
murderer.’ (b) In (487b) the argument is that Ted’s statement that he was in town at the time of the murder is 
consistent with the hypothesis that he is the murderer. 
 
7.2.2.5. Pattern 2 with a factual P-clause 
 
There appear to be three cases in which the P-clause of a pattern 2 conditional is interpreted as factual rather 
than tentative. Firstly, the P-clause of a counterfactual-P pattern 2 conditional implies #P, which is factual in 
the real world. This is the case irrespective of whether the counterfactual P is positive or negative. As already 
mentioned in section 7.2.2.3, if the P-clause of a counterfactual-P pattern 2 conditional is negative, the two 
negations—the one lexicalized by the negator, the other following from the counterfactuality—cancel each 
other, so that the P-clause is ultimately interpreted as positive and factual in the real world. In the 
terminology of section 4.1.3: ‘#[-p]’=[+p] in the actual world. (As noted in section 7.2.2.3, this is not true of 
counterfactual unless-clauses, but we will disregard these for the moment.) 
(488) 
a. 
If I {wasn’t / weren’t} John’s best friend, he wouldn’t come to me for help.  (#P = ‘NOT [-p]; the 
implication therefore is that the speaker is John’s best friend.) 
 
 
b. 
If I {was / were} John’s best friend, he would come to me for help.  (#P = ‘NOT [+p]; the implication 
therefore is that the speaker is not John’s best friend.) 
A second kind of pattern 2 conditional in which P is interpreted as factual is illustrated by the following: 
(489) 
a. 
In those days, if a prisoner was sent to work in a secret missile base, he would be killed the moment he 
was no longer usable. 
 
 
b. 
If my grandfather went to Paris he would always go by train 
Here both the P- and Q-clauses are factual; the reference is to habitual past situations. As regards the P-
clause, there is no real difference between if and whenever. 
In sum, a pattern 2 P-clause is factual when the Q-clause refers to the past, and has a factual implication 
(viz. that #P is true) if the conditional is a counterfactual-P one. 
 
7.2.2.6. Pattern 2 resulting from using would instead of will have 
 
Would can be used as a variant of will have expressing predictability concerning the past. Since the P-clause 
expressing the premise of the inferential process can use any tense form, including the preterite, we can 
therefore find pattern 2 conditionals with a P-clause referring to the past and a Q-clause using would for 
predictability concerning the past: 
(490) 
If you saw a girl in his garden, it {will probably have been / would probably be} his daughter. 
 
7.2.2.7. Pattern 2 with modal would in the Q-clause 
 
This possibility is illustrated by pattern 2 conditionals in which would expresses past volition (or absence of 
volition) or a past habit: 
(491) 
a. 
If you asked him to help you, he would do it.  (on the reading ‘Whenever you asked him to help you, he 
was willing to do it’) 
 
 
b. 
If you asked him questions about his former wife, he just wouldn’t answer.  (on the reading ‘Whenever 
you asked him questions about his former wife, he refused to answer’) 
 
 
c. 
[Sometimes we used to have breakfast very early.] If our neighbours got up at 4.30 a.m., the noise 
{would / used to} wake us up and we would get up too and begin our day.  (‘would’ expressing past 
habituality) 
 
7.3. Canonical pattern 3 conditionals 
 
A canonical pattern 3 conditional has the form ‘P-clause in the past perfect tense + Q-clause in the 
conditional perfect tense’, and is normally defined as referring to a past counterfactual world. (This means 

 
225 
that both the P-situation and the Q-situation are located in the past and are taken to be contrary to fact.) For 
example: 
(492) 
a. 
I would have been so happy if she had come!  (interpreted as implying ‘She didn’t come, hence I was 
not happy’) 
 
 
b. 
If I’d known what I know now, I wouldn’t have appointed him.  (DOC)  (interpreted as implying ‘I 
didn’t know then what I know now’ and ‘I appointed him’) 
For lack of the possibility of further backshifting, such conditionals remain unchanged in IRS, FIS and 
PR=AST: 
(493) 
a. 
[He confessed to me that] he would have been very happy if she had come. 
 
 
b. 
[She was bitterly disappointed with him.] She’d never have appointed him if she’d known then what she 
knew now. 
 
 
c. 
[She threw herself into organizing the event with a ferocious energy that was quite terrifying and] 
would have been excessive if she had been arranging the Edinburgh Tattoo.  (COB-W) 
However, we will continue using ‘pattern 3’ to indicate the form of the conditional only (i.e. the choice of 
tense forms), because the widely accepted definition of the meaning of pattern 3 conditionals is obviously 
deficient: the P-clause need not always express a counterfactual condition, and it need not be a condition 
about the past. The latter point is illustrated by the following examples, which make it clear that the P-clause 
can refer to any time. (The conditions under which the P-clause of a pattern 3 conditional can refer to the 
post-present have already been discussed—see section 5.7.2.) 
(494) 
a. 
If they had appointed that idiot chairman, the company would have gone bankrupt in no time.  (past) 
 
 
b. 
If she had been here now, she would not have supported the proposal which you are putting before us.  
(present) 
 
 
c. 
If you had come tomorrow instead of today, you wouldn’t have found me at home.  (post-present) 
As regards the cases in which the P-clause and/or the Q-clause of a pattern 3 conditional are not 
counterfactual, we can distinguish the following possibilities. 
 
7.3.1. Pattern 3 resulting from backshifting 
 
In IRS, FIS and PR=AST, a pattern 3 conditional may be the backshifted version of a conditional in which 
the P-clause uses the present perfect to express a factual, neutral, open or closed condition about the past and 
in which the Q-clause uses the future perfect to express the predictability of a Q-situation which is anterior to 
a post-present time of evaluation. For example, in (free) indirect speech the open-P pattern 1 conditional 
(495a) is ‘backshifted’ into the open-P pattern 3 conditional (495b): 
(495) 
a. 
[I don’t know if Liverpool have won tonight.] If they have won, they will have displaced Manchester at 
the top of the League. (‘Will have displaced’ expresses that if Liverpool have won tonight it is 
predictable that at some unspecified post-present time of orientation it will be clear that Liverpool has 
displaced Manchester at the top of the League.) 
 
 
b. 
[I didn’t know if Liverpool had won their game.] If they had won, they would have displaced 
Manchester at the top of the League. 
As is made clear by the sentence preceding it, the conditional in (495a) is an open-P conditional: the speaker 
does not know whether the P-situation has actualized or not. The same is true of the conditional in (495b), 
which results from backshifting (495a) in FIS. The verb forms had [won] and would have displaced do not 
convey a counterfactual meaning here: have just expresses T-anteriority. 
As another illustration, compare the following sentences: 
(496) 
a. 
If he killed the girl around 9.15, then he will probably have been back home by 10.  (direct speech / 
thought; open or closed condition; ‘killed’ refers to a situation anterior to speech time, and ‘will have 
been’ expresses present predictability of an anterior Q-situation.) 
 
 
b. 
[I realized that] if he had killed the girl around 9.15, he would probably have been back home by 10.  
(IRS; open or closed condition; ‘had killed’ refers to a situation anterior to the evaluation time 
expressed by ‘realized’, and ‘would have been’ expresses past predictability of an anterior Q-situation.) 
 
 
c. 
If he had killed the girl around 9.15, he would probably have been back home by 10.  (FIS; the only 
difference between this example and the previous one is that there is now no matrix clause of the type ‘I 
realized that...’) 

 
226 
In such backshifted conditionals, neither P nor Q is interpreted as counterfactual. The time of making the 
epistemic speech act of drawing a conclusion is the same as the (past) time of the verbal or mental reporting 
of the conclusion. The following are some further examples: 
(497) 
a. 
If he had seen Joan every day for the previous three weeks, then he would have seen her that day too.  
(FIS; past conclusion) 
 
 
b. 
If, as I thought possible, she had been on deck at the time of the murder, she would have seen what was 
happening.  (id.) 
 
7.3.2. Imaginary pattern 3 conditionals 
 
These form a second exception to the ‘rule’ that both clauses of a pattern 3 conditional are counterfactual. 
We can consider the following possibilities: 
 
7.3.2.1. Counterfactual P + imaginary Q 
 
The following is an example of a type of conditional which in sections 9.1.2.4 and 9.2.2.3 we will refer to as 
a ‘nonpreclusive-P conditional’: 
(498) 
a. 
[I know John has done a lot of work. But I am talking about the flaws in the contract now. Suppose 
John had taken a second job as an extra on the film.] (Even) if he hadn’t done anything, he would still 
have been paid the same wages as the others.  (=Even his doing nothing would not have precluded his 
being paid the same wages as the others.) 
 
 
b. 
[Why didn’t you ask me for help? If you had phoned I could have told you how to solve the problem. If 
you had e-mailed me, I would have got back to you within a day or two.] Even if you had written, I 
would still have been able to save you. 
In these examples Q does not follow from P but is presented as true in spite of P: Q runs counter to what we 
would normally expect to follow from P. It follows that, unlike P, Q is not interpreted as counterfactual, 
which it would be if Q followed from (the counterfactual) P. Thus, (498a-b) do not imply ‘he isn’t paid the 
same wages as the others’ and ‘I wasn’t able to save you’—factual implications which do arise when even 
and still are omitted. Because of the lack of these factual understandings, Q is not counterfactual but 
imaginary. This means that the speaker does not use the conditional to indirectly say something about the 
real world, but rather to refer to a purely imaginary world, i.e. to make a thought experiment (in connection 
with a purely theoretical scenario). 
The following is a similar example: 
(499) 
We would have come over anyway from Ireland if we didn’t have tickets.  (COB-W) 
Without anyway, this could be understood as a counterfactual conditional,6 implying that the speaker had 
tickets and did not come over from Ireland. The addition of anyway cancels the latter implication and creates 
a nonpreclusive-P actualization conditional with a counterfactual P and an imaginary Q-reading: the 
interpretation is that the speaker had tickets and came over from Ireland, but that having tickets was not a 
condition for coming over. 
 
7.3.2.2. Imaginary P + imaginary Q 
 
In the following pair of examples, the two clauses refer to situations which are W-simultaneous (or ‘sloppily’ 
simultaneous—see 5.1.8) with each other in an imaginary world. The only difference between the two 
examples concerns the tense used in the P-clause: 
(500) 
a. 
[“I always talked to her when she came in.” — “But you might have been busy that morning.] Would 
you have talked to her if you were busy?” 
 
 
b. 
[“I always talked to her when she came in.” — “But you might have been busy that morning.] Would 
you have talked to her if you had been busy?” 
In (500a), the past tense in the P-clause is a relative tense, expressing simultaneity between the P-situation 
and the Q-situation. (A ‘relative tense’ relates the time of the situation to a time other than the temporal zero-
                                              
6 
The if-clause could also be interpreted as concessive. An accent on didn’t brings this out. 

 
227 
point—see 5.1.5.) In (500b), the past perfect is an instance of what in section 5.1.7 was called ‘indirect 
binding’: although the P-situation is interpreted as W-simultaneous with the Q-situation, the tense form used 
does not express this W-simultaneity relation but echoes the T-anteriority relation which is already expressed 
by have been busy in the preceding context. Temporally speaking, there is no difference of interpretation 
between the two examples. 
The following pair of examples is similar to (500a-b): 
(501) 
a. 
He would have talked to Lyn if he was worried. [So she’s the person to go to if you want to find out if 
anything was bothering him.] 
 
 
b. 
He would have talked to Lyn if he had been worried. [So she’s the person to go to if you want to find 
out if anything was bothering him.] 
The temporal understanding of (500a-b) and (501a-b) is not the same as that of the following: 
(502) 
a. 
[“I can’t understand how he got inside.”] — “It would have been possible for him to get in through the 
window if it wasn’t locked.” 
 
 
b. 
[“I can’t understand how he got inside.”] — “It would have been possible for him to get in through the 
window if it hadn’t been locked.” 
These are not interpreted as temporally equivalent, because was expresses T-simultaneity while had been 
expresses T-anteriority, i.e. the P-clause of (502b) is understood something like ‘if it hadn’t been locked, as it 
should have been, by the janitor when he did his rounds earlier in the evening’. 
The reason why, in the (b) examples of (500)-(501), the W-simultaneous P-situation is described in the 
past perfect (effecting indirect binding) instead of the past tense (which is the normal tense to represent T-
simultaneity with a past time of orientation—see section 5.1.5) may be that the choice of the past perfect has 
an effect similar to that of using a past perfect which results from backshifting a past tense in order to express 
or enhance tentativeness (remoteness). (The use of backshifting in order to express nontemporal remoteness 
is described e.g. in Declerck [1991a: 77-80] and Fleischmann [1989]. It is illustrated by the past tense in I 
wanted to ask you a favour, I wish I knew, If you came tomorrow..., etc.) Compare: 
(503) 
a. 
Will she have recognized him if he was in the pub?  (The Q-clause is an open question about the 
present predictability of a past Q-situation; the P-clause refers to a situation that is T-simultaneous 
with the past Q-situation.) 
 
 
b. 
Would she have recognized him if he was in the pub that evening?  (The Q-clause is a tentative 
question about the present predictability of a past Q-situation; the P-clause refers to a situation that is 
T-simultaneous with the Q-situation.) 
 
 
c. 
Would she have recognized him if he had been in the pub?  (idem, but with indirect binding in the P-
clause) 
Sentence (503c) can not only be read as a counterfactual conditional but also as a conditional expressing 
tentative present predictability of a T-anterior Q-situation with which the P-situation is W-simultaneous.7 In 
the latter case, the only difference between (503b) and (503c) seems to be that (503c) renders the question 
more tentative (less certain or more polite). On this reading, (503c) is not counterfactual-P although it has the 
form of a pattern 3 conditional. The following example is similar to (503c): 
(504) 
[Fanthorp shook his head. “I saw no one when I went out on the deck just before the shot was fired.” — “Ah, 
but you went out by the door on the starboard side.” — “Yes. The same side as my cabin.”] — “Then, if 
there had been anybody at the port door looking through the glass you would not have seen him?” — [“No,” 
admitted Fanthorp.]  (DON) 
In this example, the conditional is the more tentative version of Then, if there was anybody at the port door 
looking through the glass you would not have seen him?, which could actually have been used instead. The 
use of had been rather than was means that the possibility of there having been someone there is presented as 
more remote, which is less confrontational (more tactful) in this context, given the implication in the first two 
sentences that the addressee believes that there was no one there. (Incidentally, [504], as well as [406] below, 
refute Wierzbicka’s [1997: 29] claim that [what we call] imaginary type 3 conditionals must have a positive 
Q-clause.) 
                                              
7 
Another possibility, which is immaterial to the present discussion, is that (503c) is interpreted as referring to two past 
situations, P and Q, of which the P-situation is anterior to the Q-situation, e.g. Would she have recognized him [on the 3rd] if 
he had been in the pub [on the evening of the 1st]? 

 
228 
The following are some further examples similar to (503c) and (504), except that it is not always clear 
whether would expresses predictability or has an imaginary meaning: 
(505) 
a. 
[“He always maintained he wasn’t in town at the time of the crime”. — “Of course.] That’s what he 
would have said if he had been the murderer.”  (See the discussion of [487] above.) 
 
 
b. 
Would you have noticed it if some people had left the building?  (=Suppose some people left the 
building. Would you have noticed it?) 
 
 
c. 
[“We have evidence that there was some trading in drugs on your old staircase over the last three or 
four years.” — “Nothin’ to do wi’ me if there was.” Brooks’s manner of speaking ... had suddenly 
switched into the coarse articulation with which he was wont to address his wife.] — “Would you have 
known, Mr Brooks, if there had been drugs?”  (DOC) 
 
 
d. 
If the butler had done it, we would have found just the clues that we did in fact find.  (Comrie 1986: 90) 
(=Suppose the butler did it. We would have found just these clues.) (=These clues are consistent with 
the hypothesis that the butler did it.) (According to Comrie [1986: 87], such examples prove that 
“English lacks counterfactual conditionals.” Needless to say, we do not subscribe to this claim.) 
The tentativeness conveyed by examples like (503c) and (505a-d) follows from the fact that, instead of 
expressing her personal epistemic judgement on the (un)likelihood or (un)reality of the two situations, the 
speaker does no more than hypothesize, i.e. conduct a pure thought experiment. Sentence (505d) is perhaps 
the clearest example of this: the inspector merely develops a mental scenario and remarks that this scenario is 
in keeping with the clues that have actually been found. This sentence is therefore a tentative way of saying 
The clues we have found suggest that the butler could have done it. 
In the following example, the conditional also has an imaginary meaning, but consists of a combination of 
a pattern 3 Q-clause and a pattern 2 P-clause (using the past tense to express sloppy simultaneity): 
(506) 
[Let us suppose, for the sake of the argument, that you and she had made up your minds to be united at all 
costs. In that case, why bother with contraception? What did it matter if Andrée were pregnant? I put it to 
you, Monsieur Falcone, that] it would not have made the slightest difference <if Andrée became pregnant>, 
[unless it were to bring matters to a head sooner than was intended.]  (BLUR) 
Here the conditional It would not have made the slightest difference if Andrée became pregnant has an 
imaginary Q-clause. (As we will see in section 13.3.1, this is why the Q-clause can be followed by an 
exceptive unless-clause.) The irrealis Q-clause is imaginary (rather than counterfactual) because it does not 
imply anything in connection with the real world: we do not know from this sentence whether the Q-situation 
(and the P-situation) actualized or not. 
It may also be noted that next to using would have, an imaginary Q-clause may also use could have or 
might have, in which case it expresses imaginary possibility: 
(507) 
a. 
[“I’m sure that neither of them could have murdered Brooks. ... But she could have done. Ellie Smith 
could have done—if only just. She went to Birmingham that Wednesday—you’ve checked on that. But 
we can’t be sure when she came back, can we? You see,] if she’d come back an hour, even half an hour 
earlier ...” — “She could have stolen the knife, [you mean?].”  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
[“What about the girl who was with him? I mean, would he have taken her to such a club?] She might 
have been scandalized if he’d done that.” — [“I know, it doesn’t seem very likely. Still, you never 
know.”] 
Notice also that examples like (503c) cannot be further backshifted in IRS, FIS or PR=AST: 
(508) 
Morse ... asked whether they, either landlord or landlady, would have known the murdered man if they had 
seen him in the pub.  (DOC) 
Up to now section 7.3.2.2 has been concerned with pattern 3 conditionals in which both P and Q are 
imaginary and refer to past situations that are interpreted as (sometimes sloppily) simultaneous with each 
other. Apart from this, there is also the possibility that the conditional refers to an imaginary past Q-situation 
to which the imaginary P-situation is itself anterior. Compare: 
(509) 
a. 
If he was only in her pub for ten minutes, say, will she have recognized him three days later?  (The Q-
clause is an open question about the present predictability of a Q-situation that is T-anterior to the time 
of speech; the P-situation is W-anterior to the Q-situation.) 
 
 
b. 
If he had been in her pub on Monday, would she have recognized him on Tuesday?  (The Q-clause is a 
tentative question about the present predictability of a Q-situation that is T-anterior to the time of 
speech; the P-situation is W-anterior to the Q-situation.) (If the interrogative Q-clause is read as a 

 
229 
rhetorical question, this conditional is interpreted as counterfactual-P rather than imaginary-P. An 
example of a sentence allowing such a reading is ‘If he had been in her pub for the first time on 
Monday, would she have recognized him on Tuesday?’) 
It should be noted that, instead of using the past perfect to represent the P-situation as T-anterior to the Q-
situation, the P-clause can also use an absolute past tense (which simply locates the P-situation in the past). 
In the following example the two possibilities are mixed: the first P-clause uses the past perfect, while the 
next three P-clauses use absolute past tenses. However, all the P-situations are interpreted as W-anterior to 
the Q-situation: 
(510) 
[“Well, I’ve been assuming all along that the theft of the knife from the Pitt Rivers was a blind: a blind to 
establish an alibi, or alibis; to try to establish the fact that Brooks wasn’t murdered until AFTER the knife was 
stolen.” She nodded, appreciating the point immediately. “You mean,] if he’d been murdered on a particular 
day with one knife, and then, the day after, a second knife was stolen; and if the first knife was subsequently 
removed from the body, and the second knife <was> inserted into the wound—people like the police, like 
you, could well have been misled about the time of death.”  (DOC) 
 
7.3.3. Pattern 3 with closed P-clause and putative would in the Q-clause 
 
This is the third (and final) possibility for a pattern 3 conditional to yield a noncounterfactual interpretation. 
As in the type described in section 7.3.1, P expresses a closed condition, but this time the past perfect is not 
the result of backshifting: 
(511) 
[“So, what you’re saying is that you ran away although you hadn’t done anything wrong?” — “Yes.” — “I 
believe you. But] if you hadn’t done anything wrong, why would you have run away? [That’s what the police 
will want to know.]” 
In this example, why would you have run away? is interchangeable with why should you have run away? 
This means that would has a ‘putative’ meaning (Declerck 1991b: 422—see also section 6.4.2): it represents 
the running away as something theoretical rather than factual. (The same use of would / should is to be 
observed in sentences like Why would / should he help me? or How would / should I know?) The P-clause of 
(511), however, is clearly interpreted as closed: the speaker uttering the conditional assumes that the contents 
of her P-clause are true. 
 
7.4. Conclusion 
 
In this chapter we have examined the types of conditional that appear in the superficial form of tense pattern 
1, 2 or 3. We have come to the following conclusions: 
(a) Although pattern 1 is usually associated with open-P conditionals, it can also (under certain conditions) 
express a neutral-P, closed-P, tentative-P or counterfactual-P conditional. 
(b) Pattern 2 conditionals can express several meanings: tentative-P, factual-P, a backshifted pattern 1 (in 
IRS, FIS or PR=AST), a combination of counterfactual P and counterfactual Q, or of counterfactual P and 
imaginary Q, or of imaginary P and imaginary Q. Sometimes the would of the Q-clause expresses 
predictability concerning the past (=will have been) or has a modal meaning (viz. past volition [or absence 
thereof] or a past habit). 
(c) In canonical pattern 3 conditionals, both clauses are usually interpreted as counterfactual and as referring 
to the past. However, under certain conditions, the two clauses can also refer to the present or future. There 
are also pattern 3 conditionals in which the P-clause and/or the Q-clause is/are not counterfactual: pattern 3 
resulting from backshifting in IRS, FIS or PR=AST, a combination of counterfactual P and imaginary Q, or 
of imaginary P and imaginary Q or of a closed P and a Q with ‘putative would + perfect infinitive’. 
In addition, we have seen that the meanings which are traditionally assigned to the three canonical 
patterns of conditional can in fact be expressed by various other tense forms, and that the meanings 
traditionally given are ‘incomplete’: open-P conditionals do not necessarily refer to the post-present, 
counterfactual-P conditionals need to be distinguished from imaginary-P conditionals, etc.

Chapter 8 
 
The relation between the theoretical world and the actual world 
 
 
8.1. Introduction 
 
The following are some of the conclusions that we arrived at in chapter 4: 
(a) In case-specifying-P conditionals that receive a theoretical-P interpretation, P refers to a theoretical 
(=nonfactual) world. If there is a semantic presupposition of a particular kind relating the theoretical P-
world to the real world, the P-world is a nonneutral theoretical world, i.e. a closed, open, tentative or 
counterfactual world. 
(b) If there is no such presupposition, i.e. if the speaker does not assume (presuppose) anything concerning 
the truth relation between the theoretical P-world and the actual world, the P-world is a neutral 
theoretical world. (If the P-world is both neutral and irrealis, we speak of an imaginary P-world.) 
(c) In closed-P conditionals, the theoretical P-world is assumed to be identical with the actual world: P is 
assumed to be true in the actual world. (The basic difference from factual-P conditionals is that the 
speaker need not know for a fact that P is true: she just assumes this. She presents the information on 
which she bases the conclusion Q as ‘treated as true, for current purposes’, whether or not she knows it 
to be true or false or does not know either way. Closed-P conditionals also differ from factual-P ones in 
that the former are always echoic.) 
(d) In open-P conditionals it is semantically presupposed that there is a real possibility of the theoretical P-
world being like the actual world. In tentative-P conditionals the assumption is usually that this is 
unlikely (though not impossible). 
(e) In counterfactual-P conditionals, the theoretical P-world is semantically presupposed to be contrary to 
the actual world. (See also Karttunen [1971].) Brée (1982: 160) comes to the same conclusion by 
applying the well-known tests for semantic presuppositionhood to counterfactual-P conditionals. 
(f) In theoretical-P conditionals, Q by implicature belongs to the same theoretical world as P. This means 
that the truth of P in that world is normally assumed to entail the truth of Q in the same world (at least if 
Q has a truth value). 
If P is true in a counterfactual P-world, it follows from (e) that P cannot be true in the actual world, and from 
(f) that Q is as a rule also true in the counterfactual P-world and therefore false in the actual world. (The 
possibility of combining a counterfactual P with an imaginary Q need not be taken into account here because 
if Q is imaginary, it does not have a truth value in the actual world.) However, as has already been noted 
(section 4.2.4) and will be further explained in section 8.3.2 below, the latter claim—that Q is counterfactual 
if P is—is not a question of semantics, but rather of a pragmatic implicature. Since, other things being equal, 
the actual world is more relevant to the speaker and hearer than a nonfactual (theoretical) world, it follows 
from the Gricean Maxim of Relation (relevance)8 that a speaker is normally expected not to locate a 
situation in a nonfactual world if its actualization is true in the actual world. In other words, if [+q] must be 
interpreted as true, a cooperative speaker will locate it in the actual world, either indirectly (by locating [-q] 
in a counterfactual world) or directly. In both cases the hearer will conclude that [+q] is true in the actual 
world. However, as is typical of pragmatic implicatures, the understanding that in a counterfactual-P 
conditional, #Q (=not-Q) is meant to be read as factual (since Q is meant to be read as counterfactual) can be 
ruled out by a constituent of the Q-clause or by the linguistic or extralinguistic context. In that case the Q-
clause can only be interpreted as imaginary. In section 4.2.9 we have illustrated this with the following pairs 
of examples: 
(512) 
a. 
If we had taken the other road, we would have been here in time.  (Like P, Q is interpreted as 
counterfactual: the implication is that #Q [=we were not here in time] is taken to be true in the actual 
world.) 
                                              
8 
The Maxim of Relevance (which Grice called the Maxim of Relation) stipulates that the speaker’s contribution should be 
relevant at the point in the discourse at which it is made. 

 
231 
 
 
b. 
[“We are in time because we have taken the road I said we should take.”] — “If we had taken the other 
road, we would also have been in time.”  (The counterfactual Q-interpretation is blocked by the 
preceding context and the use of ‘also’. As a result, Q is interpreted as true in an imaginary world.) 
(513) 
a. 
If you had attended the meeting, you would have known about their plans.  (Q is interpreted as 
counterfactual; the implication is that #Q is true in the actual world, i.e. that the addressee does not 
know about ‘their’ plans.) 
 
 
b. 
[“I only got to know about their plans because Jim told me.”] — “If you had attended the meeting, you 
would also have known about their plans.”  (The counterfactual Q-interpretation, which implies ‘You 
don’t know about their plans’ is blocked by the addition of ‘also’. This results in an imaginary reading 
of Q.) 
So, the understanding that Q is counterfactual is not part of the semantics of a counterfactual-P conditional 
but is due to a pragmatic implicature: a counterfactual P-clause creates an irrealis Q-world in which Q may 
be either counterfactual or imaginary. However, failing an indication to the contrary, the unmarked reading is 
for Q to be interpreted as counterfactual. 
In some cases, the implicature of Q-counterfactuality is relatively weak. Thus in (514), there is not a 
strong suggestion that the speaker does not herself take vitamin C during the winter: 
(514) 
If I were you, I’d be taking vitamin C during these winter months. 
The relative weakness of the Q-counterfactuality implicature in (514) (which may even be entirely absent) is 
due to the pragmatic function which (514) is understood to have, viz. offering advice. Pragmatically, where a 
course of action is advised which the speaker herself might be expected to have some interest in following, it 
is at least reasonable to suppose that she might take that course of action herself. 
On the other hand, there are also conditionals with If I were you... where the implicature of 
counterfactuality of Q is very strong, as in cases where the speaker predicates something of herself in the 
counterfactual position of being the hearer and the predication is not interpreted as advice, but as a simple 
exercise of the imagination (albeit with various possible intended perlocutionary effects): 
(515) 
[You’re overweight because you have a hard life, you’re miserable and you eat sweets all the time to 
compensate.] If I were you, I’d be overweight too. 
In (515), the hearer is justified in assuming that the speaker does not consider herself to be overweight. That 
is, there is an understanding that it is only appropriate to utter the conditional in (515) if Q is really (believed 
by the speaker to be) counterfactual. However, the speaker may actually be overweight too, so that the 
expected Q-counterfactuality is not present. In that case the hearer cannot reply You are lying: you ARE 
overweight, because the counterfactuality is not stated but only implicated. 
What the above examples teach us is that conditionals with a counterfactual P-clause do not assert 
anything about the (non)truth of Q in the actual world. They just express that if P is true in a counterfactual 
world, Q is true in an irrealis (i.e. counterfactual or imaginary) world. (This is true irrespective of whether Q 
is [-q] or [+q]). If Q is true in a counterfactual world, then it is not true in the real world. But if Q is true in an 
imaginary world, then it may or may not be true in the real world — there is simply no expression of the 
likelihood or unlikelihood that the possible world and the real world coincide. Since what we learn about Q 
from a counterfactual-P conditional is only that Q is irrealis, it follows that we cannot directly conclude from 
it anything about the likelihood that Q is true or is not true in the real world. However, there is an implicature 
saying that if P is counterfactual, Q may be taken to be true in the counterfactual P-world (and hence to be 
counterfactual too), unless there is an indication to the contrary. This implicature is often quite strong, but 
can always be blocked or cancelled by a suitable context. 
A similar conclusion can be drawn in connection with the Q-propositions of open-P and tentative-P 
conditionals. Here too there is an implicature saying that Q may be taken to be true in the open or tentative P-
world (rather than in any other world), but this implicature can be cancelled: 
(516) 
a. 
I will be happy if Sarah comes.  (Maybe the speaker will be happy anyhow, even if Sarah doesn’t come. 
In that case Q is not only true in the P-world.) 
 
 
b. 
If we arrived late at the station, we would miss our bus.  (Maybe the speaker will miss her bus anyhow, 
because it will leave early. In that case Q is not only true in the P-world.) 
In sum, conditionals with an open, tentative or counterfactual P-clause do not assert the nature of the relation 
between Q and the actual world. However, the unmarked interpretation (by implicature) is that Q is true in 
the relevant P-world and is not true in any other world. 

 
232 
The implicature in question can be identified with the ‘conditional perfection’ implicature which will be 
discussed in section 12.4.2. (This implicature refers to the fact that in suitable contexts if tends to be 
interpreted as only if. Thus, I will help you if you pay me £5 is conventionally interpreted as ‘I will help you 
only if you pay me £5’.) Consider: 
(517) 
a. 
If you don’t send her a birthday card, Mum will be furious. 
 
 
b. 
If you didn’t send her a birthday card, Mum would be furious. 
 
 
c. 
If you hadn’t sent her a birthday card, Mum would’ve been furious. 
Sentence (517a) asserts that the untensed unmodalized Q-proposition ‘Mum be furious’ is true in the open P-
world in which the P-proposition ‘you not send her a birthday card’ (=[-p]) is true, and implicates that Q is 
not true in any other world.9 More specifically, the understanding is that Q is not true in a P-world in which 
a different P, such as [+p], is true: (517a) implicates ‘If you send her a birthday card, Mum will not be 
furious’. It follows that (517a) is read as ‘Mum will be furious iff (=if and only if) you don’t send her a 
birthday card’. Similarly, (517b) asserts that the untensed unmodalized Q-proposition ‘Mum be furious’ is 
true in the tentative [-p]-world created by if you didn’t send her a birthday card, and implicates that Q is not 
true outside that P-world, e.g. in the corresponding tentative [+p]-world: the implicated reading is ‘If you 
sent her a birthday card, Mum would not be furious’. This means that (517b) is read as ‘Mum would be 
furious iff you didn’t send her a birthday card’. Finally, (517c) asserts that the untensed unmodalized Q-
proposition ‘Mum be furious’ is true in the counterfactual [-p]-world created by if you hadn’t sent her a 
birthday card, and implicates that Q is not true outside that [-p]-world, for example in the corresponding 
counterfactual [+p]-world (‘If you had sent her a birthday card’) or in an imaginary world. In other words, 
(517c) implicates ‘If you had sent her a birthday card, Mum wouldn’t have been furious’. For this reason, 
(517c) is read as ‘Mum would have been furious iff you hadn’t sent her a birthday card’. 
The origin of the implicature, which comes down to saying that if should be interpreted as ‘iff’ (=if and 
only if) wherever possible and which is commonly referred to as the “conditional perfection implicature”, 
will be explained in section 12.4.2 below. In a nutshell it is this. The Gricean Maxims of Quantity (part 1)10 
and Relevance stipulate that, if the speaker mentions one or more conditions for Q, she should mention all 
the conditions for Q that are not presupposed or self-evident, i.e. all the conditions that are relevant to the 
discourse and are not deducible from it. In technical terms: a co-operative speaker should mention all the P-
worlds in which Q is true, as long as it is relevant to do so.11 Reference to only one P-world in which Q is 
true therefore suggests that there are no other P-worlds in which Q is true. This leads to the implicature that if 
should be read as ‘if and only if’. In the absence of any indication to the contrary, (517a) will therefore be 
interpreted as meaning that my not sending Mum a birthday card is a necessary and sufficient condition for 
her being furious in the relevant future P-world. 
As is typical of conversational implicatures, this conditional perfection implicature can be blocked or 
cancelled by the context. The implicature (‘if=iff’) in If it doesn’t rain, we’ll go to the seaside can be 
cancelled by an addition like As a matter of fact, we’ll go to the seaside anyhow, even if it rains. In Mum will 
be happy if you send her a birthday card, the implicature may or may not arise. It does not when it is clear to 
the hearer that the sentence is intended to mean no more than ‘she’d like that’, without any implication that it 
is necessary to her happiness. The implicature does not arise either in ‘relevance conditionals’ (because in 
this type the truth of P is not a condition for the truth of Q): P only expresses the condition under which the 
speaker deems it relevant to utter the Q-clause: 
(518) 
If you’re a Catholic, there is a Catholic church in Broad Street. 
In sum, in conditionals with an open, tentative or counterfactual P-proposition, there is in principle no 
relation between the truth of Q in the theoretical P-world and the truth of Q in any other world. However, the 
                                              
9 
As we saw in 5.5.2, it is typical of open conditionals referring to the post-present that the intensional Q-world established by 
will coincides with the intensional P-world created by if. The intensional world in question is linguistically treated as a 
temporal domain. 
10 The first stipulation of the Maxim of Quantity is that the speaker should give all the information that is required for a good 
understanding of the discourse. (The second stipulation is that the speaker should not give superfluous information which is 
potentially confusing or distracting.) 
11 See also Noordman (1985: 303): Grice’s “maxim of quantity says: make your contribution to the conversation informative. So, 
the speaker of a conditional sentence is cooperative only if the necessary conditions he does not mention are irrelevant or 
satisfied.” 

 
233 
unmarked interpretation is that if Q is true in the P-world, it is not true in any other world (e.g. the actual 
world). This interpretation is due to an implicature. 
It follows that if a speaker wants to express a Q-conclusion about the actual world, she is more likely to 
use a clause with a factual meaning, or a closed-P conditional in which Q is implicated to be true in the 
actual world, than a conditional with an open, tentative or counterfactual P-clause. Compare: 
(519) 
a. 
Because he had nowhere to go to, he was soon arrested. 
 
 
b. 
[“I just saw John.” — “Oh,] if John ‘s here, Mary must be here too.” 
 
 
c. 
[We don’t know where he is. But] if he leaves his hiding-place, he will no doubt be arrested. 
In (519a), not only the head clause but also the because-clause is factual. (In fact, the latter is presupposed to 
be true in the actual world.) In (519b), the P-clause expresses a condition that is closed, i.e. treated as true for 
current purposes. The fact that P echoes a factual statement, and the fact that Q is said to be true or valid in 
the P-world, leads to a strong implicature that Q is not only true in the world that echoes the actual world, but 
also in the actual world itself.12 In (519c), both P and Q are assumed to be true in an open theoretical P-
world. That is, what the sentence says is that Q is true in a theoretical world in which P is true, without 
saying anything directly about the actual world. However, it is implicated that Q (‘he be arrested’) is true 
only if the open P-proposition (‘he leave his hiding-place’) is true. In other words, the expectation (by 
implicature) is that, if the P-situation does not actualize, the Q-situation will not actualize either, i.e. that if P 
does not come true, Q will turn out to be false in the actual world. 
It should also be noted that, strictly speaking, only inferential conditionals can assign a truth value for Q 
in the actual world. Actualization-conditionals and purely case-specifying conditionals do not express a 
relation between the truth of P and the truth of Q. Inferential conditionals do express this: their P-clause 
expresses a condition for the drawing of the conclusion in Q. This does not mean, however, that an 
inferential says something directly about the relation between Q and the actual world: it only expresses an 
inference from P to Q. However, if P has a truth value in the actual world, and the inference made in Q is 
valid, then Q will also have a truth value in the actual world. 
 
8.2. Epistemic modalizers 
 
We may conclude that in open-P, tentative-P and counterfactual-P conditionals the Q-proposition is not 
normally assigned a truth value in the actual world, except (sometimes) by implicature. It is in principle only 
assigned a truth value in the theoretical (intensional) P-world. This is the case even if the Q-clause contains 
an epistemic auxiliary or adverb. Compare: 
(520) 
a. 
If—as appears to have been the case—she went to him last night, she {must / may} already have met 
him several times.  (closed-P) 
 
 
b. 
If (as you tell me) she went to him last night, she has {probably / possibly / perhaps / no doubt} already 
met him several times.  (closed-P) 
(521) 
a. 
If you ask him politely, he {may / will perhaps / will certainly} do it for you.  (open-P) 
 
 
b. 
If you asked him politely, he {might / would perhaps / would certainly} do it for you.  (tentative-P) 
 
 
c. 
If you had asked him politely, he {might / would perhaps / would certainly} have done it.  
(counterfactual-P) 
                                              
12 The claim that the truth of Q in the actual world is only implicated in (519b) is in keeping with the different interpretations we 
assign to the following examples: 
 
(i) 
A. 
She went to him last night. 
 
 
B. 
If she went to him last night, she {must / may} already have met him several times.  (closed-P conditional) 
 
 
C. 
Yes, but she didn’t go to him last night. 
 
(ii) 
A. 
She went to him last night. 
 
 
B. 
Yes, and since she went to him last night, she {must / may} already have met him several times.  (factual ‘since’-
clause) 
 
 
C. 
Yes, but she didn’t go to him last night. 
 
In (i) it does not seem that C is really contradicting B—the yes can be understood as implying that C agrees with what B has 
said, namely that premise P leads to conclusion Q—but C’s utterance provides new information, namely that premise P actually 
does not coincide with the facts. It is theoretically feasible for B to reply Ah, well in that case... without going back on anything 
she has said in her first utterance. By contrast, in (ii) it is not so easy to make sense of C’s yes, except as a token gesture, an 
agreement that the conclusion would be plausible (if the premise were correct), because C is straightforwardly contradicting B. 
In (ii), if B replies Ah, well in that case..., the reply seems strange in that it fails to acknowledge that accepting that what C has 
said is true renders B’s first utterance false. 

 
234 
In the two closed-P conditionals in (520), the fact that P echoes a factual statement, and the fact that Q is said 
to be true or valid in the P-world, leads to a strong implicature that Q is not only true in the world that echoes 
the real world, but also in the real world itself. This means that the hearer has a right to interpret the 
epistemic modalizers as saying something about the actual world. The closed P-clauses themselves are not 
within the scope of the modalizers. In the conditionals in (521), on the other hand, the epistemic modalizers 
do not say anything about the actual world, because they have wide scope over the entire ‘if P, Q’ complex, 
and therefore have the supposition of if in their scope: (521a) means ‘It is possible / certain that [he will help 
you if you ask him politely]’. The difference of scope of the modalizers in (520a-b) on the one hand and 
(521a-c) on the other is due to the fact that the conditionals are closed-P in the former and open-P, tentative-
P or counterfactual-P in the latter. 
As to the P-clauses, it was noted in section 4.2.10 that (in theoretical-P conditionals) these do not allow 
epistemic markers at all, except when P is a closed condition. In that case the theoretical world is assumed to 
be like the real world, and since propositions about the real world can be epistemically modalized, the same 
is true of the closed P-proposition: 
(522) 
a. 
If (as you say) she {must / could / may (perhaps) / might} have heard about it, we’d better have a talk 
with her.  (closed-P) 
 
 
b. 
[“Julie might come tomorrow.” — “Damn!] If Julie might come tomorrow, I’ll have to stay at my office 
all day.”  (closed-P) 
It follows that if we insert a modalizer into an open or tentative P-clause, the result is a closed P-clause. 
Compare: 
(523) 
a. 
If she comes tomorrow, I will remain at my office all day.  (open-P) 
 
 
b. 
If she may (perhaps) come tomorrow, I will remain at my office all day.  (closed-P) 
(524) 
a. 
If she came tomorrow, I would remain at my office all day.  (tentative-P) 
 
 
b. 
If she might (perhaps) come tomorrow, I {*would / will) remain at my office all day.  (closed P-
conditional with ‘might’ as tentative alternative to ‘may’; the conditional cannot be interpreted as a 
tentative-P conditional) 
 
8.3. The importance of the relation between the theoretical world and the actual world 
 
So far it has been argued that open-P, tentative-P and counterfactual-P conditionals only express a relation 
between the truth of P and the truth of Q in the theoretical P-world, without stating anything directly about 
the truth of Q in the actual world. However, this does not alter the fact that the relation between the two 
worlds may sometimes be important for the use of the conditional. The following subsections give 
illustrations of this. 
 
8.3.1. Counterfactual indirect inferentials 
 
In ad absurdum inferentials and indirect inferentials with a counterfactual verb form in the Q-clause—see 
3.6.2—it is the nontruth (absurdity or counterfactuality) of Q in the actual world that serves as the basis for 
the speaker’s conclusion that P cannot be true: 
(525) 
a. 
If you wrote that article, I’m Shakespeare. 
 
 
b. 
If my mother-in-law wasn’t coming tomorrow, I wouldn’t have spent all day cleaning the house, would 
I? 
 
8.3.2. The implicature of counterfactuality of Q in counterfactual-P conditionals 
 
Even though open-P, tentative-P and counterfactual-P conditionals in principle only refer to a theoretical 
(nonfactual) P-world and assert nothing directly about the truth of Q in the actual world, it remains a fact that 
in one of these types, viz. counterfactual-P conditionals, there is an implicature saying that, if possible, Q 
should be taken to be counterfactual (=false in the real world), rather than true in an imaginary (=neutral) 
world. Thus I would make a cake if she were here implicates that the (untensed and unmodalized) Q-
proposition ‘I make a cake’, which is true in the counterfactual P-world, is not true in the actual world. In 
other words, speaking about the truth of Q in a counterfactual P-world is an indirect way of saying something 

 
235 
about the truth of #Q (=not-Q) in the actual world: if Q is true in a counterfactual P-world, then #Q is 
implicated to be true in the actual world. 
 
8.3.3. Cancelling the implicature of counterfactuality of Q 
 
A counterfactual-P conditional explicitly says something about the truth of Q in the real world if the 
implicature (that Q is as counterfactual as P) is cancelled. Consider the following examples (already referred 
to in section 8.1): 
(526) 
a. 
If we had taken the other road, we would have been here in time. 
 
 
b. 
If we had taken the other road, we would {also / still} have been here in time. 
 
 
c. 
Even if we had taken the other road, we would have been here in time. 
The unmarked interpretation of (526a) follows from the relation between the counterfactual P-world and the 
actual world: since Q (‘we be here in time’) is true within a P-world which is unlike the actual world, it is 
suggested (a) that Q is not true in the actual world, i.e. is counterfactual, and (b) that #Q (=not-Q) is true in 
the actual world. On the default interpretation of (526b), these implicatures are cancelled by also or still, 
which equate the Q-situation with a factual situation.13 In (526c) the implicature is blocked by the addition 
of even to if—see section 14.1.3. In both (526b) and (526c) the result is that the untensed unmodalized Q-
proposition ‘We be here in time’ is interpreted as true not only in the counterfactual P-world but also in the 
actual world. 
The implicature that Q is counterfactual if P is counterfactual can not only be cancelled or blocked by a 
constituent of the Q-clause but may also be blocked by (i.e. fail to arise because of) the context—see also 
Brée (1982: 161): 
(527) 
[For a while there was such a shrill girlish commotion that] I couldn’t have made myself heard if I’d had the 
equivalent of the message to Garcia.  (BR) (‘if’=‘even if’: the context induces a concessive interpretation of 
‘if’, which disrupts the typical conditional relationship) 
The implicature can also be blocked by the nature of the P-clause. Thus, whereas If I hadn’t come I would 
have betrayed her implicates ‘I have not betrayed her’, the ‘counteridentical’ conditional If I had been you, I 
would have betrayed her implicates neither ‘I have not betrayed her’ nor ‘I have betrayed her’. As explained 
in section 4.2.7, the reason behind this difference is that in inherently counterfactual P-clauses like If I {were 
/ had been} you, the speaker is not ‘I in the actual world’ (i.e. ‘I in my true identity’) but ‘I in the 
counterfactual world in which I am you’ (i.e. ‘I assuming the identity of the hearer’). This should be clear 
from the following examples: 
(528) 
a. 
If I weren’t so ill, I would help you.  (The fact that Q [‘I help you’] is true in the counterfactual P-
world implicates that Q is false in the actual world, in other words that ‘#[+q]’ [‘I not help you’], is 
presently true.) 
 
 
b. 
If I were you, I wouldn’t help him.  (The fact that Q [‘I not help him’] is true in the counterfactual P-
world does not implicate that Q is false in the real world. If the implicature went through, it would lead 
to the conclusion that ‘#[-q]’, which is equivalent to [+q] [‘I help him’], was true in the real world. 
However, this is not how the sentence is interpreted.) 
 
 
c. 
If I were the Prime Minister, I would be feeling very embarrassed about the whole affair.  (The 
implicature that Q, because it is true in the counterfactual P-world, is false in the real world does not 
go through. We do not interpret the conditional as implicating that ‘I not feel very embarrassed’ is true 
in the real world.) 
Only in (528a) is there an implicature reversing the polarity of the Q-clause. In other words, in (528b-c) the 
implicature that Q is counterfactual in the real world if it is true in the counterfactual P-world does not arise. 
Similarly: 
(529) 
a. 
If I hadn’t come, I would have betrayed you.  (The fact that Q [‘I betray you’] is true in the 
counterfactual P-world implicates that it is false in the real world, in other words that ‘#[+q]’, which is 
equivalent to [-q] [‘I not betray you’], is true [at some time] in the real world.) 
                                              
13 The implicature is not cancelled if also does not equate the Q-situation with a factual situation, as in the following example: 
 
(i) 
[I suggested two routes. If we’d come via Newbury we would have made it, and] if we’d taken the other road we would 
also have been here in time. [But Harry insisted on taking the way he knows, so that’s why we are late.] 

 
236 
 
 
b. 
If I had been you, I would have betrayed the gaffer.  (The implicature would lead to the conclusion that 
‘#[-q]’, which is equivalent to [+q] [‘I betray the gaffer’], is true in the real world. However, this is not 
how the sentence is interpreted: my betraying or not betraying the gaffer in the real world forms no 
part of the interpretation of [529b].) 
Only in (528a) and (529a) is there a ‘reversal of polarity’ of the Q-clause. (Thus, I would have betrayed you 
in [529a] implies ‘I did not betray you’.) In (528b-c) and (529b), the implicature that Q is false in the real 
world if it is true in the counterfactual P-world does not arise because P is a ‘counteridentical’—see section 
4.2.7.3. 
Note that the point of (529b) is neither to implicate that I betrayed the gaffer nor to implicate that I did 
not. In other words, (529b) does not aim to imply or implicate anything at all about me in the real world. The 
same is true of (528b-c), but not of (528a) and (529a). This difference obviously has to do with the special 
kind of counterfactual P-supposition that is made in (528b-c) (viz. If I were {you / the Prime Minister}) and 
(529b) (viz. If I had been you). The P-clauses here identify I with someone else. However, the P-clauses are 
counterfactual, which has as a consequence that while the ‘someone else’ is included in the reference to the 
P-world, the speaker (=myself) is actually excluded from it. In other words, in (528b-c) and (529b), the Q-
proposition concerns the hearer (you) rather than the speaker (I), even though the subject of the Q-clause is I. 
Thus, the purpose of (529b) is to say that the hearer did not do what the speaker would have done in his 
position. This explains why (529b) does not assert or implicate anything about ‘me in the actual world’: 
while (529b) implicates the counterfactuality (in the real world) of the hearer’s betraying the gaffer, it does 
not implicate anything whatever about me—more correctly, about the truth of a Q-proposition with I as 
subject—in the real world. In other words, the usual implicature that Q is counterfactual if P is counterfactual 
fails to arise. 
As another illustration, consider the following pair: 
(530) 
a. 
If I were there, I would help him. 
 
 
b. 
If I were you, I would help him. 
While (530a) implicates that I am not helping him, (530b) implicates nothing about the truth of Q (‘I help 
him’) in the real world. In other words, the Q-clause of (530b) is taken to be true in an imaginary, rather than 
counterfactual, Q-world, so that it is left vague whether I myself help him or not. 
Notice that it is not only counteridentical P-clauses like If I {were / had been} {you / the Prime Minister} 
that cause the problem of the identity of the person to whom Q applies. Exactly the same problem arises in 
the following: 
(531) 
[John’s very brave.] If I had found a burglar in my house I would have fainted. 
The special accent on I entails a specificational (see section 3.14) reading of the P-clause: ‘if it had been I 
(and not John) who found a burglar in my (rather than his) house’. This conditional resembles (528b-c) and 
(530b) in that it implicates neither that I fainted nor that I did not faint in the actual world. Its primary 
implication is ‘I would faint in that kind of situation’. This is accompanied by an implicature which arises via 
the Maxim of Relevance (‘Why am I speaking about my reactions in an imaginary world?’). The implicature 
in question is ‘This forms a contrast to John’s reaction’. In other words, the search for relevance leads the 
hearer to assume that the conditional If I had found a burglar in my house I would have fainted is supportive 
of the preceding assertion John’s very brave and thus to interpret the conditional as formulating a contrast to 
John’s reaction (and probably even thus to infer that John did not faint). 
Our above claims that in counterfactual-P conditionals P is semantically presupposed to be false in the 
actual world while Q is implicated to be so is confirmed by the well-known test that implicatures are 
cancellable whereas semantic presuppositions are not—see also Karttunen (1971); Brée (1982: 160): 
(532) 
a. 
If Gordon had been the lecturer, it would have been a good lecture.  (This presupposes that Gordon was 
not the lecturer and implicates that it was not a good lecture.) 
 
 
b. 
*If Gordon had been the lecturer, it would have been a good lecture. In fact, Gordon was the lecturer.  
(This is unacceptable because the second sentence contradicts the counterfactual-P presupposition of 
the conditional.) 
 
 
c. 
If Gordon had been the lecturer, it would also have been a good lecture.  (This is acceptable because it 
is the implicature, not the presupposition, that is cancelled by ‘also’.) 
Moreover, a semantic presupposition is retained under nonmetalinguistic wide scope negation, while an 
implicature is not. This test confirms our claims about (532a): 

 
237 
(533) 
It is not true that if Gordon had been the lecturer, it would have been a good lecture.  (This still presupposes 
that Gordon was not the lecturer but does not implicate anything definite about the quality of the lecture that 
was actually given.) (We speak of “anything definite” because even in [533] there might be a slight 
implicature that the actual lecture was not good. This implicature would be triggered by the Maxim of 
Relevance: out of context there does not seem a reason for uttering [533] if the actual lecture was good. The 
speculation about the lecture having been good if John had been the lecturer does not seem to be triggered 
by anything if the actual lecture WAS good.) 
 
8.3.4. The communicative function of the counterfactual-P conditional 
 
There is still another connection between the counterfactual P-world and the actual world. Apart from a 
semantic-pragmatic meaning, conditional sentences also have a communicative function, i.e. they are uttered 
for a particular reason, which can be to convey a particular message concerning the actual world. This 
function can depend on the semantic type of conditional (especially the illocutionary speech act expressed in 
the Q-clause), but also on pragmatic factors. We will briefly consider two such communicative functions: 
expressing the speaker’s or the referent of the subject’s disposition, and giving advice. 
 
8.3.4.1. Counterfactual-P conditionals with Q-clause expressing a disposition 
 
Consider: 
(534) 
a. 
If I were there, I would do it. 
 
 
b. 
They’d all have gladly murdered Brooks, even if they hadn’t known he was a murderer himself.  (DOC) 
Sentences like these reveal the referent of the subject’s disposition to do something. This dispositional 
reading follows from the pragmatic fact that if one has the disposition to do something in a counterfactual P-
world, this is probably because one has this disposition anyway, i.e. in any pragmatically relevant world, 
including the actual one. (Note that the notion of disposition has nothing to do with the notion of truth: 
[534a] implicates that, because Q [‘I do it’] is true in a counterfactual P-world, it is false in the real world, 
but there is no implicature that the disposition which exists in the counterfactual P-world does not exist in the 
actual world.) 
It appears to be a fact that, from a communicative point of view, counterfactual-P conditionals are very 
often used in order to convey a dispositional reading rather than to express the counterfactuality of Q in the 
actual world: 
(535) 
a. 
If I were {you / the President}, I would be feeling very embarrassed about the whole affair.  (The Q-
clause does not implicate ‘I am not feeling embarrassed’; the conditional expresses the dispositional 
idea ‘In {your / the President’s} place I would be embarrassed’.) 
 
 
b. 
If your father had been alive today, he would have been very happy to hear that news.  (The message 
conveyed is not ‘he is not happy’ but ‘he had the disposition to be happy on hearing such news’.) 
 
 
c. 
If your father were alive today, he would be proud of you.  (similar) 
 
 
d. 
If I had been there, I would have fainted on the spot.  (The point of the utterance is not to implicate ‘I 
didn’t faint’ but to express my disposition to faint under such circumstances.) 
 
 
e. 
If John had seen that, he would have laughed.  (Via telling the hearer something about John in a 
counterfactual situation, this sentence tells the hearer something about a disposition of John in the 
actual world.) 
It should be noted, however, that, in saying that a particular conditional indicates a disposition of the subject 
referent, we do not intend to imply that this should be seen as the only, or necessarily the major, pragmatic 
function of the utterance concerned. The speaker of If your father were alive today, he would be proud of you 
may intend, via the reference to the father’s disposition, to indicate her own approval, or indeed disapproval 
(if, for example, the speaker always disagreed strongly with her father’s opinions). It is also important to see 
that the above dispositional use of counterfactual-P conditionals has nothing to do with the “dispositional” 
(Fillmore 1986: 171) use of would in sentences like He’d cry at the least provocation (in those days). This 
use is a modal use, which is often referred to as expressing ‘characteristic behaviour’ in the past—see, for 
example, Declerck (1991b: 413-414). 
 
8.3.4.2. Counterfactual-P conditionals with Q-clause expressing advice 
 

 
238 
Apart from a dispositional reading, a counterfactual-P conditional can also receive an advisability reading. 
That is, dispositional counterfactuals in which the Q-clause is interpreted as referring to the (immediate or 
distant) future often have the additional communicative function of giving advice. This advisability reading 
too comes about pragmatically: since we normally treat our own dispositions as qualities that are good and 
should be generalized, a sentence like If I were you, I would do it, which is indirectly interpreted as a 
message about ‘you-in-the-actual-world’, conveys the message that I find it advisable for you to have the 
same disposition as I have myself. In other words, the hearer is advised to do the same thing as the speaker 
would do if she were in the hearer’s position. 
It is in keeping with this that the advisability interpretation arises only if the Q-clause receives an agentive 
interpretation, i.e. if Q refers to a situation over which the referent of the subject has control. Thus, there is 
no advisability reading in If I were you, I’d feel embarrassed or in If I were there, I would be of no use. 
Another condition for the reading to arise is that the reference is not to the past—one cannot advise someone 
to have done something—but rather to the future. If the reference is to the present, there may be a sense of 
advisability, but this sense arises via a less conventional pragmatic route and is certainly much weaker than 
when the reference is to the post-present: 
(536) 
a. 
If I were you, I’d complain to the manager.  (tentative Q-clause referring to the near future; clear sense 
of advice) 
 
 
b. 
If I were you, I’d be complaining to the manager.  (counterfactual Q-clause referring to the present; no 
such clear sense of advice) 
Apart from If I were you...-conditionals (and other counteridenticals), there are other conditionals that can be 
similarly used as indirect expressions of advisability: 
(537) 
a. 
If Our Lord had been faced with your problem, He would have sent the money back. 
 
 
b. 
If your father had been faced with your problem, he would have sent the money back. 
What these examples have in common with the counteridenticals (536a-b) is that the speaker explains what 
somebody other than the hearer (i.e. either the speaker himself or a third party) would have done if they had 
found themselves in the same position as the hearer. Whether the prediction of a course of action on someone 
else’s part is taken as advice — and if so, whether it is seen as a recommended course of action or one to be 
avoided — will, of course depend on the context. For example, (537a) is positive advice because it is 
presupposed that Our Lord is always right. Sentence (537b) will be interpreted as positive advice if the 
speaker is understood to think that the addressee’s father was infallibly right, and neutral or negative advice 
if the speaker is understood to think that the addressee’s father was infallibly wrong in his actions. 
 
8.4. Nonassertoric interrogative Q-clauses 
 
Throughout this chapter we have been concerned with the relation between the truth of P in a theoretical 
world and the (non)truth of Q in the same theoretical world and in the real world. In doing so we have 
restricted ourselves to Q-statements, which have a truth value, and said nothing about nonassertoric 
interrogative Q-clauses, which do not.14 
Nonassertoric ‘yes / no-questions’ (‘truth questions’) do not have a truth value (and cannot, therefore, be 
the Q-clause of an inferential—see section 4.2.4), but they are still concerned with truth. Consider: 
(538) 
a. 
If you win a lot of money, will you give me some? 
 
 
b. 
If you won a lot of money, would you give me some? 
 
 
c. 
If you had a lot of money, would you give me some? 
 
 
d. 
If you had had a lot of money, would you have given me some? 
                                              
14 As we saw in section 3.5, an interrogative clause is not assertoric if it is an ‘open question’, i.e. if it asks for information which 
is unknown (or purported to be unknown) to the speaker. However, an interrogative clause is assertoric (i.e. makes an assertion) 
in the following cases: (a) if it is a ‘rhetorical question’; (b) if it is a ‘declarative question’; and (c) if it expresses a ‘yes / no-
question’ (polar interrogative) which is really interpreted as an assertion followed by a question tag. The following examples 
illustrate the three possibilities, respectively: 
 
(i) 
If he was there, must that mean he was the murderer?  (=‘...Surely, that does not mean that...’) 
 
(ii) 
If you command all these people, you’re the captain?  (=My conclusion is that you are the captain. Is that correct?) 
 
(iii) If you command all these people, are you the captain?  (intended reading: ‘If you command all these people, you’re the 
captain, aren’t you?’, in which the question tag expresses something like a challenge.) 

 
239 
The interpretations of these run parallel with those of (noninferential) conditionals with an open, tentative or 
counterfactual P-clause and a declarative Q-clause. In connection with the latter we have come to the 
conclusion that there is in principle no relation between the truth of Q in the theoretical P-world and the truth 
of Q in the actual world. However, as explained above, the unmarked interpretation is that if Q is true in the 
P-world, it is not true in any other world. This interpretation is due to an implicature. Similar conclusions can 
be formulated in connection with (538a-d): these conditionals are concerned with the truth of Q in the 
theoretical P-world, but not with the truth of Q in the real world. In other words, the understanding is that the 
Q-question does not pertain to any world other than the P-world. (This does not mean, of course, that the 
answers to [538a-d], whilst dealing with a nonactual world, will not be interpreted as saying something about 
the actual relationship between speaker and addressee.) 
Unlike nonassertoric yes / no-questions, Q-clauses that are nonassertoric wh-questions (content questions) 
referring to a theoretical world are not concerned with truth but ask for specificational (see section 3.14) 
information: they ask for the specification of a value for a variable (represented by the wh-word) in the given 
(open, tentative or counterfactual) P-world. In doing so they are not concerned with any other world, such as 
the actual one: 
(539) 
a. 
If you win a lot of money, what will you do with it? 
 
 
b. 
If you won a lot of money, what would you do with it? 
 
 
c. 
If you had a lot of money, what would you do with it? 
 
 
d. 
If you had had a lot of money, what would you have done with it? 
In sum, in conditionals with an open, tentative or counterfactual P-proposition and a nonassertoric 
interrogative Q-clause, there is in principle no relation between the actualization of the Q-situation in the 
theoretical P-world and the actualization of the Q-situation in the actual world. However, the unmarked 
interpretation is that whether or not the Q-situation actualizes in the P-world, it does not do so in any other 
world (such as the actual world). This interpretation is due to the implicature described above. 
It follows that we must be careful when speaking about counterfactuality in connection with conditionals 
like (538c) and (539c). Because of their reference to the present, the P-clause (If you had a lot of money) of 
these conditionals is interpreted as counterfactual. The Q-questions apply neither to the actual world nor to a 
counterfactual one, but to an imaginary world. This reveals an important distinction between case-specifying-
P conditionals with a (nonassertoric) Q-question and case-specifying-P conditionals with a Q-statement. As 
we have seen, the unmarked (by implicature) interpretation of the latter is that Q receives the same 
theoretical interpretation as P. Thus, in If I had a lot of money, I would give you some, P is interpreted as 
counterfactual (i.e. as not true in the actual world) and Q is interpreted as true in that counterfactual P-world. 
By contrast, in (538c) (If you had a lot of money, would you give me some?) and (539c) (If you had a lot of 
money, what would you do with it?), Q is interpreted as imaginary, although P is counterfactual. This follows 
from the obvious fact that questions without a truth value cannot be false (counterfactual). Naturally, this 
also applies to counterfactual-P conditionals of pattern 3: in (538d) (If you’d had a lot of money, would you 
have given some to me?) and (539d) (If you’d had a lot of money, what would you have done with it?), the Q-
question does not have a counterfactual meaning but an imaginary one. 
The above conclusion about independent Q-questions also applies to dependent Q-questions: 
(540) 
[...there wasn’t much talking at the dinner table, despite Wolfe’s attempts to start a discussion on] what New 
York would be like today if the Dutch hadn’t got muscled out by the English a few centuries back.  (COB-W) 
Here too, the (dependent) Q-question hypothesizes within an imaginary Q-world. 
 
8.5. Conclusion 
 
In this chapter we have investigated how English speakers and hearers interpret the relation between a 
particular kind of theoretical world and the actual world. The following are the main conclusions that have 
been reached: 
(a) Conditionals with an open, tentative or counterfactual P-clause do not assert the nature of the relation 
between Q and the actual world. However, the unmarked interpretation (by implicature) is that Q is true in 
the relevant P-world and is not true in any other world. 
(b) The above rule applies even if the Q-clause contains an epistemic auxiliary or adverb. 

 
240 
(c) The application of this rule does not alter the fact that the relation between the theoretical Q-world and 
the actual world may sometimes be important for the use of the conditional. This has been illustrated with 
reference to the following types of conditional: 
(i) In counterfactual indirect inferentials, it is the nontruth (absurdity or counterfactuality) of Q in the actual 
world that serves as the basis for the speaker’s conclusion that P cannot be true. 
(ii) In counterfactual-P conditionals, speaking about the truth of Q in a counterfactual P-world is an indirect 
way of saying something about the truth of #Q (=not-Q) in the actual world: if Q is true in a 
counterfactual P-world, then #Q is implicated to be true in the actual world. 
(iii) A counterfactual-P conditional explicitly says something about the truth of Q in the real world if the 
implicature (that Q is counterfactual if P is) is cancelled or blocked. 
(iv) Another connection between the counterfactual P-world and the actual world has to do with the 
communicative function of the counterfactual-P conditional: they may be uttered for the communicative 
purpose of conveying a particular message concerning the actual world. This function can depend on the 
semantic type of conditional (especially the illocutionary speech act expressed in the Q-clause), but also 
on pragmatic factors. We have briefly considered two such communicative functions: expressing the 
speaker’s or the referent of the subject’s disposition, and giving advice. 
(d) As regards nonassertoric interrogative Q-clauses, we have come to the following conclusions: 
(i) Nonassertoric ‘yes / no-questions’ do not have a truth value (and cannot, therefore, be the Q-clause of an 
inferential), but they are still concerned with truth. These conditionals are concerned with the truth of Q 
in the theoretical P-world, but not with the truth of Q in the real world. In other words, the 
understanding is that the Q-question does not pertain to any world other than the P-world. 
(ii) Q-clauses that are nonassertoric wh-questions referring to a theoretical world are not concerned with truth 
but ask for specificational information: they ask for the specification of a value for a variable 
(represented by the wh-word) in the given (open, tentative or counterfactual) P-world. In doing so they 
are not concerned with any other world, such as the actual one.

Chapter 9 
 
A typology of case-specifying P-clauses 
 
 
In section 3.8 it was pointed out that on the basis of the functional contribution of the P-clause to the 
meaning of the conditional as a whole, we can say that case-specifying-P conditionals (i.e. conditionals 
whose P-clause specifies the case[s] in which Q is valid) are either actualization conditionals, inferentials, or 
purely case-specifying-P conditionals.15 In this chapter we will investigate these three types, and the many 
subtypes they comprise, in more detail. 
 
9.1. Actualization conditionals 
 
9.1.1. Definition 
 
Actualization conditionals are case-specifying-P conditionals which express a condition for the actualization 
of the Q-situation. (Remember that we use ‘situation’ as a cover term for anything that can be expressed in a 
sentence—actions, events, processes, states— and ‘actualize’ as a cover term for the verbs that are typically 
associated with these categories—perform, happen, take place, hold. This means that not only dynamic 
situations but also states are said to ‘actualize’.) The P-clause of an actualization conditional will be referred 
to as an ‘actualization-conditioning’ P-clause. 
 
9.1.2. Types of actualization-conditioning P-clauses 
 
On the basis of their interpretation, we can distinguish between five types of actualization-conditioning P-
clauses: 
the 
P-clause 
may 
be 
‘actualization-triggering’, 
‘preclusive’, 
‘actualization-licensing’, 
‘nonpreclusive’, or have an ‘in case’ meaning. The following subsections examine these five types in some 
detail. 
 
9.1.2.1. Actualization-triggering P-clauses 
 
Actualization-triggering-P conditionals are found in actualization conditionals that have a ‘cause and effect’ 
connotation: the actualization of the P-situation triggers the actualization of the Q-situation:16 
(541) 
a. 
If you press this button, the fire alarm goes off. 
 
 
b. 
If the enemy attacks, we will defend ourselves. 
 
 
c. 
I always help her if she needs me. 
 
 
d. 
If you don’t pay your gambling debts, they abduct one of your children. 
 
 
e. 
I will only help her if she does me a favour in return. 
It is typical of actualization-triggering-P conditionals that Q is mostly [+q]—see, however, (541d)—and that 
the Q-situation is not normally anterior to the P-situation—see, however, (541e). Conditionals in which the 
Q-situation is anterior to the P-situation are usually inferentials: 
(542) 
If she is divorced, she’s been married.  (Sweetser 1990: 116) 
In section 9.2.2.2 below, such inferentials will be labelled ‘backtrackers’. 
 
                                              
15 This chapter will refute Tynan & Lavin’s (1997: 116) claim that all ‘if P, Q’ sentences are inferentials: “Given the truth of p, q 
will be found to be true”, i.e. “conditional sentences are essentially concerned with truth.” 
16 At first sight this category might seem to correspond to Harder’s (1996: 450) “trigger conditionals”. However, Harder defines 
these as conditionals in which “the movement from if-clause to main clause is causal, temporal and inferential at the same time. 
The causal link can be regarded as the basic warranting relationship; because it operates in real time, it creates the temporal 
sequence, and because it is seen as invariable it licences an inferential sequence.” However, it is not obvious that there is 
temporal sequence in (541c), nor that there is much inferential in (541a-b) and especially in (541c). Still, we consider all of 
these as actualization-triggering-P conditionals. (Apart from this, our ‘actualization-triggering-P’ type is only one of five types 
of actualization conditionals. Harder does not make these distinctions.) 

 
242 
9.1.2.2. Preclusive-P actualization conditionals 
 
In this type, the actualization of the P-situation triggers the nonactualization of the [+q]-situation, i.e. the P-
situation precludes (prevents) the [+q]-situation. For this reason, Q is always [-q]. Consider: 
(543) 
If it freezes, the contest will not be cancelled. 
This conditional yields two interpretations: 
(544) 
a. 
It is not the case that frost will cause the contest to be cancelled. 
 
 
b. 
Frost will preclude the contest being cancelled. 
The former interpretation will be natural when speaking e.g. of a judo contest that is to take place outdoors, 
while the latter will be the unmarked one when speaking e.g. of an outdoors skating contest. The two 
interpretations can be represented more generally as follows: 
(545) 
a. 
NOT [P will trigger [+q]] (where NOT represents external or metalinguistic negation) 
 
 
b. 
P will trigger Q (where Q is [-q]) 
The former interpretation is clearly the denial of an actualization-triggering-P conditional. It is an instance of 
what in section 3.13 was called a ‘denied conditional’. Denied conditionals are usually echoic (i.e. they deny 
a statement to the contrary) or reject an expectation, as in the above example of the outdoor judo contest, 
where the expectation is that frost will cause the contest to be cancelled. Reading (545b) also seems to be 
actualization-triggering-P, but it is special in that what is triggered is not the actualization of a situation but 
its nonactualization. It is an instance of what in section 3.13 was called a ‘conditioned denial’. Because this 
label does not apply to actualization conditionals only, we will adopt the convention of using the more 
specific label ‘preclusive-P actualization conditional’ in connection with actualization conditionals of this 
type. In sum, in what follows we will refer to actualization conditionals interpreted as ‘P causes [+q]’ as 
actualization-triggering-P, and to conditionals interpreted as ‘P causes [-q]’ (or ‘P precludes [+q]’) as 
preclusive-P actualization conditionals (or ‘actualization-precluding-P conditionals’). (These categories are 
not affected by the addition of external negation.) 
In sum, when a conditional is concerned with actualization and there is a negation in the Q-clause which 
is not constituent negation (i.e. very local negation, as in If he’s sulking, he will see no one for days), the 
actualization-triggering-P reading is ‘It is not the case that the actualization of the P-situation triggers the 
actualization of the [+q]-situation’, whereas the preclusive-P reading is ‘The actualization of the P-situation 
triggers the nonactualization of the [+q]-situation’. The following further illustrate the latter category: 
(546) 
a. 
If there are other visitors, we won’t stay long.  (preclusive-P: ‘[+p] {triggers / will trigger} [-q]’, i.e. 
‘[+p] will prevent [+q]’) (The notation ‘[+p] will trigger [-q]’ is short for ‘the actualization of the 
[+p]-situation {triggers / will trigger} the nonactualization of the [+q]-situation.’) 
 
 
b. 
I won’t enjoy the trip if Myriam comes too.  (preclusive-P: ‘[+p] will prevent [+q]’) 
 
 
c. 
{If you ignore the doctor’s advice / If you don’t take your medicine / If you go out in the rain}, you 
won’t get well again.  (preclusive-P) 
It should also be noted that when a conditional is concerned with actualization and there is a negation in the 
Q-clause, there may sometimes be a third interpretation. Consider: 
(547) 
If we attack them, they don’t defend themselves. 
Apart from the (implausible) preclusive-P reading (‘[+p] triggers [-q]’) and the actualization-triggering-P 
reading (‘It is not the case that [+p] triggers [+q]’), there is also the interpretation ‘[+q] does not actualize if 
[+p] actualizes’, i.e. ‘[+p] is incompatible with [+q].’ In this reading, which is also of the ‘conditioned 
denial’ type, the P-clause is purely case-specifying—see section 9.3 below—and there is no triggering or 
preclusive link between the actualization of [+p] and the nonactualization of [+q]. The only link there is in 
this reading concerns the incompatibility of [+p] and [+q]. 
 
9.1.2.3. Actualization-licensing-P conditionals 
 
Actualization-licensing-P conditionals are conditionals whose P-clause is ‘actualization-conditioning’ in a 
weaker sense: instead of causing (triggering) or preventing the Q-situation, the P-situation merely enables the 
Q-situation to actualize: 

 
243 
(548) 
a. 
I could open the door if I had the key. 
 
 
b. 
We would make more progress if we could hire more workers. 
 
 
c. 
If the witness is prepared to testify, we have a strong case against Harry Field. 
 
 
d. 
If we pretend to give in, we gain time. 
 
9.1.2.4. Nonpreclusive-P actualization conditionals 
 
In this subtype the P-clause is ‘actualization-conditioning’ in the weakest possible sense: instead of 
triggering, preventing or enabling the actualization of the Q-situation, the actualization of the P-situation 
merely does not preclude (prevent) the Q-situation actualizing. The interpretation now is that, although one 
might expect the Q-situation not to actualize if the P-situation does, the actualization of the P-situation in fact 
does not preclude the actualization of the Q-situation. As will be noted in section 14.1.1, even if typically 
triggers this interpretation (in implicative conditionals generally), and so does the use of an adversative 
adverb (still, nonetheless...) in the Q-clause. The reason is that even, still, etc. cancel an expectation to the 
contrary: 
(549) 
a. 
Even if it rains, we’ll go to the seaside. 
 
 
b. 
If it rains, we’ll still go to the seaside. 
 
 
c. 
The man who wears company colours must also sing the company song—even if this means 
compromising himself.  (COB-W) 
However, there are also examples in which if is used without even or still, yet, etc.: 
(550) 
a. 
I wouldn’t do that job if they paid me a million dollars. 
 
 
b. 
I will have it, if it costs me a million dollars! 
The effect of counterfactuality in nonpreclusive-P conditionals is not the same as in other actualization 
conditionals. Compare: 
(551) 
a. 
If he had paid his debts, he wouldn’t have been beaten up. 
 
 
b. 
If he had paid his debts, he would still have been beaten up. 
 
 
c. 
Even if he had paid his debts, he would have been beaten up. 
The first sentence is interpreted as implying ‘#[+p], hence #[-q]’ (=‘not [+p], hence not [-q]’): He didn’t pay 
his debts, hence he was beaten up. The other two conditionals do not yield a similar (inferential and/or 
actualization-triggering) reading (paraphrasable with hence), because they are nonpreclusive-P conditionals. 
In this type, the P-situation does not trigger the Q-situation: the latter is predicted to actualize in spite of the 
actualization of the P-situation. Whereas (551a) expresses that ‘the [+p] situation triggers the [-q] situation’ 
in a counterfactual world, the addition of even or still in (551b-c) entails that the same [+p] situation triggers 
the [+q] situation in a counterfactual world: ‘In the counterfactual world in which he paid his debts, he would 
be beaten up all the same’. Similarly: 
(552) 
a. 
If he hadn’t said anything, he wouldn’t have betrayed us.  (=In the counterfactual world in which he did 
not say anything, he did not betray us; this implies ‘#[-p], hence #[-q]’ [=‘[+p], hence [+q]’] in the 
real world: he said something, hence he betrayed us.) 
 
 
b. 
If he hadn’t said anything, he would still have betrayed us.  (=In the counterfactual world in which he 
did not say anything, he betrayed us in spite of that; this implies that in the actual world he said 
something and betrayed us.) 
 
 
c. 
Even if he hadn’t said anything, he would (still) have betrayed us.  (idem) 
It should be noted that the P-clause of a nonpreclusive-P conditional may also express an open or tentative 
condition. The following run completely parallel to (552a-c): 
(553) 
a. 
If he doesn’t say anything, he won’t betray us. 
 
 
b. 
If he doesn’t say anything, he’ll still betray us. 
 
 
c. 
Even if he doesn’t say anything, he’ll (still) betray us. 
(554) 
a. 
If he didn’t say anything, he wouldn’t betray us. 
 
 
b. 
If he didn’t say anything, he’d still betray us. 
 
 
c. 
Even if he didn’t say anything, he’d (still) betray us. 
 
9.1.2.5. Actualization conditionals introduced by in case 
 

 
244 
In case-P conditionals form the fifth subtype of actualization-conditioning-P conditionals. This type differs 
from the ‘actualization-triggering-P’ type in that it is the anticipated possibility of the actualization of the P-
situation, rather than the actualization itself, that triggers the actualization of the Q-situation. This means that 
this type of conditional may be true even if the P-situation does not actualize at all. For example: 
(555) 
I always carried an umbrella in case it rained (but it never did). 
In such in case P-clauses, actualization of the P-situation is treated as neither a sufficient nor a necessary 
condition for the actualization of the Q-situation. As was noted in section 2.4, British English very seldom 
uses in case in the sense of actualization-triggering if. The more normal uses of in case are the 
‘precautionary’ use (as in [555]), the ‘preclusive’ (preventative) use (as in I wore sunglasses in case I was 
recognized), its use after expressions of apprehension (fear or concern) (as in She was frightened in case 
something happened to her child), and its use in relevance conditionals (as in In case you need a car, you can 
rent one here). In all these interpretations, in case combines the semantics of if with those of because or so 
that. Such sentences in fact hardly seem to be genuine conditionals: what we have called ‘the question mark 
inherent in if’ seems to be, at least to a large extent, present in P, but hardly in the relation between P and Q. 
In fact, Q actualizes or is valid no matter what happens. This is clear from the frequent use in the Q-clause of 
tense forms with a factual meaning and of adverbs like always, never, etc. Still, we think it is warranted to 
include at least some in case-sentences (viz. those in which in case has a precautionary or preclusive 
meaning) in the class of actualization conditionals because, in (555), there would not be actualization of the 
Q-situation (=carrying an umbrella) if the possibility of rain were not anticipated. It is knowledge about the 
occasional (or perhaps frequent) actualization of the P-situation, and induction from that knowledge, that 
triggers the actualization of the Q-situation. 
 
9.1.3. ‘Prerequisite-P’ versus ‘restrictive postscript-P’ 
 
In actualization-conditioning P-clauses that do not have an ‘in case’ meaning, the condition for the 
actualization of the Q-situation may be just a sufficient condition or a sufficient plus necessary one. (This 
will be further investigated in chapter 12.) 
If P expresses a necessary condition, we speak of a ‘prerequisite-P conditional’ if the P-clause is fully 
integrated (syntactically) into the Q-clause, and of a ‘restrictive postscript-P conditional’ if the P-clause is 
offered as a ‘postscript’ or afterthought, i.e. if the postposed P-clause is syntactically relatively independent. 
(Preposed P-clauses do not allow this possibility.) Compare: 
(556) 
a. 
If you love her, trust her.  (sufficient condition) 
 
 
b. 
If it rains, we won’t go to the seaside.  (The condition is a sufficient condition, pragmatically 
interpreted as being also a necessary condition—see section 12.4.3.1—but not a prerequisite, because 
the idea of necessary condition is neither asserted nor entailed but only implicated.) 
 
 
c. 
This section is optional and only operates if the appropriate premium is paid.  (COB-W) (prerequisite-P 
because of the addition of ‘only’ to ‘if’) 
 
 
d. 
She says she will lend you some money providing you promise to pay it back.  (prerequisite-P) 
 
 
e. 
As long as proper consideration is given to acclimatisation, it may be possible to see species of 
Prioniturus such as the Blue-crowned Racket-tailed Parrot established within aviculture around the 
world.  (COB-W) (prerequisite-P) 
 
 
f. 
So long as you enjoy yourself, it doesn’t really matter where you go on holiday.  (prerequisite-P) 
 
 
g. 
I’ll drop in and see you at 10 tonight, if you will be alone.  (QUI) (restrictive postscript-P) 
 
 
h. 
[Mr Griffin gave a jerky nod, smiled, sipped some sherry and said, “Wonderful collection. Interesting 
old house too. Beautiful park.” As if he had received a personal compliment, Henry Wallbank’s face 
turned red. He shifted from foot to foot made vague embarrassed movements with his hands, and said,] 
“Glad to take you round it properly myself tomorrow morning, if you’re staying on.”  (COB-W) 
(restrictive postscript-P) 
Restrictive postscript P-clauses always follow the Q-clause, are preceded by a pause (represented by a 
comma or dash in writing), and have a separate intonation contour. This is consistent with their function of 
adding an ‘a posteriori’ condition to the Q-clause (which is quite interpretable in isolation). In this respect, 
restrictive postscript P-clauses differ from ‘set-identifying P-clauses’ like those in Children are orphans if 
their parents are dead, which also have a case-specifying and restricting function, but are syntactically fully 
integrated into the Q-clause. 
 

 
245 
9.2. Inferential conditionals 
 
9.2.1. Definition 
 
Inferential conditionals differ from actualization-conditioning P-clauses in that they are concerned with the 
validity of an inferential reasoning process involving both P and Q rather than with the relation between the 
actualization of the P-situation and that of the Q-situation. (This does not necessarily mean, however, that 
one meaning excludes the other—see below.) 
(557) 
a. 
If it wasn’t Greene who wrote Bruno’s dream, it {was / must have been} Murdoch. 
 
 
b. 
If the boy is often beaten by his father, he {must be / is probably} traumatized. 
 
 
c. 
He can’t be a doctor if he doesn’t know that! 
 
 
d. 
If you spent £25 yesterday, you’ll have only £12 left for the rest of the week. 
 
 
e. 
If you enjoy gardening, or just visiting gardens, I’m sure that you will want to be part of this exciting 
project.  (COB-W) 
 
 
f. 
If you don’t understand, Andy, I’m not sure you’d really want me to explain.  (COB-W) 
These examples belong to the most common type of inferential, viz. that in which the inference goes from P 
to Q (irrespective of the order of the two clauses). In such a ‘direct inferential’ the case-specifying P-clause is 
‘premise-expressing’, i.e. it expresses the most relevant premise underlying the process of reasoning leading 
to a conclusion about the truth of the Q-proposition. 
In section 10.3.3.1, we will argue that ‘premise-expressing’ should not be equated with ‘evidential’. 
Evidential P-clauses are ‘truth-evaluating’ P-clauses like those in (558a-b), which resemble premise-
expressing P-clauses in that they offer the epistemological basis underlying the Q-statement—see section 
10.3.3.1: 
(558) 
a. 
If we’re to believe Mary, Joan’s pregnant. 
 
 
b. 
If the results we’ve got so far are anything to go by, we’re wasting our time. 
However, these evidential P-clauses are not premise-expressing because they do not presuppose the truth of 
P and they therefore represent the truth of Q as relatively uncertain (whereas in inferential conditionals the 
speaker commits herself more strongly to the truth of Q). In other words, in the above examples the P-clauses 
represent the epistemological basis as not sufficiently strong for the speaker to commit herself fully to the 
truth of Q. 
It is also important to see that premise-expressing P-clauses express the most relevant rather than the only 
premise underlying the inferential reasoning process. An inference is normally made on the basis of various 
premises, most of which, however, are pragmatically presupposed and therefore not considered to be worth 
mentioning. Thus, if a murder is committed and there were three people in the house, then I can say (without 
laying myself open to a charge of being either illogical or misleading) If A didn’t do it, C did it provided I 
know for certain that B cannot have done it. The latter condition is a crucial premise in the inferential 
reasoning process, but I don’t need to mention it if I can take it for granted. (See section 12.4.2, where we 
examine the origins of the necessity and/or sufficiency understandings of P-clauses.) 
 
9.2.2. Direct inferentials 
 
There are several kinds of inferential conditional, only one of which is of the premise-expressing-P type. 
This type, which we refer to as ‘direct inferential’, is probably the best known type of conditional: P is 
presented as the starting-point (premise) of an inferential reasoning process which leads to the conclusion Q. 
This conclusion by definition concerns the truth of Q: the speaker asserts that if P is true, the Q-proposition 
(whether [+q] or [-q]) must also be true. In other words, the whole conditional means ‘If P is true, Q is true’. 
We can distinguish three subtypes of direct inferentials: 
 
9.2.2.1. Standard direct inferentials 
 
The following illustrate this unmarked type: 
(559) 
a. 
If Reg was in the house at that time, he {was / is} the murderer.  (=‘if [+p], then [+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
If Reg has an alibi for that time, he {wasn’t / isn’t} the murderer.  (=‘if [+p], then [-q]’) 
 
 
c. 
If Reg wasn’t in the house at that time, he {wasn’t / isn’t} the murderer.  (=‘if [-p], then [-q]’) 

 
246 
 
 
d. 
If Reg doesn’t have an alibi for that time, he {was / is} the murderer.  (=‘if [-p], then [+q]’) 
Because direct inferentials, which are sometimes called “epistemic conditionals”—see e.g. Sweetser 
(1990)—are concerned with the truth of Q, the Q-clause must be a linguistic expression with a truth value. 
This means that the Q-clause cannot be an imperative or nonassertoric question, since these are not the 
expression of a proposition, hence do not have a truth value. The Q-clause must be a statement (assertion), as 
in the above examples, or an ‘assertoric question’ (see section 3.5) such as a rhetorical question: 
(560) 
a. 
If WE don’t help him, who will?  (interpreted as ‘If WE don’t help him, no one will.’) 
 
 
b. 
If John was in the house at the time, does that make him the murderer?  (Q-message: Surely, that 
doesn’t make him a murderer.) 
 
 
c. 
If he’s some kind of local king, {need / does} that mean we should be afraid of him?  (Q-message: 
Surely, that doesn’t mean we should be afraid of him.) 
 
 
d. 
If my own brother won’t give me a job, who will?  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
If one elephant can cause this damage, what can a herd of eighty do? 
As the examples show, both wh-questions (content questions) and yes/no-questions (polar questions) can be 
used with the force of an assertion, in which case they may be the Q-clause of an inferential conditional. This 
distinguishes them from conditionals whose Q-clause is a nonassertoric question, which as a rule—see, 
however, section 9.1.4 below—belong to the class of ‘utterance conditionals.’ (As we will see in section 
10.1, utterance conditionals are conditionals whose P-clause expresses what renders it possible, relevant or 
necessary for the speaker to utter the Q-clause.) When the Q-clause is a nonassertoric wh-question, the 
interpretation is that the truth of P evokes the question Q. Thus, If JOHN wasn’t in the library, who was? 
means ‘The assumption that JOHN wasn’t in the library leads to the question who actually was in the library.’ 
In other words, the P-clause provides the reason for the interrogative speech act made in the Q-clause: ‘if P is 
true, Q is a {logical / valid / legitimate / reasonable} question.’ The Q-clause invites the addressee to answer 
that wh-question. When the Q-clause is a (nonassertoric) yes/no-question rather than a wh-question, the truth 
of P similarly provides the reason for the interrogative speech act made in the Q-clause: 
(561) 
If the child was there at the time, could it be that she understood what you were talking about? 
Returning to the subject of direct inferential conditionals, we can point out that the inferential speech act may 
be lexicalized: 
(562) 
If Oswald didn’t kill Kennedy, I {conclude / infer} that someone else did. 
Such a full verb (=nonauxiliary) lexicalizing the inferential speech act can show different degrees of 
epistemic certainty: the conclusion can be represented as doubtful, likely, possible, etc. rather than as simply 
true. 
(563) 
a. 
If he comes, I {think / reckon / assume / expect / am sure / doubt} that there will be trouble. 
 
 
b. 
If her brother falls into the hands of the police, I {am convinced / know / am sure} she will not go 
through with the scheme. 
 
 
c. 
If he knew it, I do not know what he would do. (Poutsma 1926: 193) (=...he would do I do not know 
what) 
 
 
d. 
Had he lived twenty years longer, it is probable that the seven provinces would have been seventeen.  
(Poutsma 1926: 193) 
The use of an epistemic modal adverb or auxiliary in the Q-clause has the same effect: 
(564) 
a. 
If none of the pupils stole the book from the library, it is {probably / presumably / possibly / certainly / 
surely} one of the teaching staff who took it. 
 
 
b. 
If none of the pupils took the book from the library, it {must / could / might / may} have been one of 
the teaching staff. 
If the P-clause precedes the Q-clause, as in (563a-d), the use of a full verb lexicalizing the inferential speech 
act results in a special syntactic structure in which the inferred Q-proposition is expressed not by the entire 
Q-clause but only by the embedded that-clause.17 Such sentences are of the syntactic type which, in section 
11.4, we will call ‘displaced-P conditionals.’ 
                                              
17 This formal characteristic is also found with ‘NEG-raising’ structures: In I don’t think he’s ill the negation is conventionally 
interpreted as bearing on he’s ill rather than on I think. 

 
247 
It is clear from what has been said so far that inferentials are conditionals that are concerned with truth 
rather than with actualization. As has already been pointed out, this means that we do not consider 
conditionals whose Q-clause is a directive or a nonassertoric question to be inferentials: such Q-clauses do 
not have a truth value. Consider: 
(565) 
a. 
If you are free now, please help me with these parcels. 
 
 
b. 
If you are free now, will you please help me with these parcels? 
 
 
c. 
{Why not / Let’s} do it at once if you are free now. 
 
 
d. 
If John was beaten up, who was the one who did it? 
Though one might say that in (565a-c) the speaker concludes from the (assumed or possible) truth of P that it 
is appropriate for her to tell or ask the hearer to make the Q-situation actualize, this is not sufficient to 
conclude that such sentences are inferentials: the link is not between the truth of P and the truth of Q, but 
between the truth of P and the directive speech act expressed in the Q-clause. Similarly, in (565d) the link is 
between the truth of P and the interrogative speech act conveyed by the Q-clause. In section 10.1.5, sentences 
like (565a-d) will be treated as ‘nonassertoric Q-utterance conditionals.’ 
However, as we have already pointed out (section 4.2.4), this does not mean that the Q-clause of an 
inferential conditional can never express deontic modality. Some clauses with a deontic meaning do have a 
truth value. Compare: 
(566) 
a. 
(on seeing the milkman arrive)  If the milkman is already there, {I should hurry up. / I’d better hurry up. 
/ *hurry up, girl. / *let’s hurry up. / *why not hurry up?}.  (As stressed in section 4.2.4, the asterisks 
apply only to the case where P is the result of the speaker noticing the milkman herself: if P is an echoic 
response to someone telling her that the milkman is there, the asterisked cases are acceptable.) 
 
 
b. 
If you haven’t found it, keep on looking for it.  (Q without truth value) 
 
 
c. 
If that is true, I’d better take my precautions.  (Q with truth value) 
When the Q-clause of a standard inferential is negative, we can speak of a ‘preclusive-P inferential’ (by 
analogy with ‘preclusive-P actualization conditionals’—see section 9.1.2.2): 
(567) 
If JOHN paid Kitty’s debts, no one else {did / can have done}. 
The idea is that premise P allows no other conclusion than [-q]. 
 
9.2.2.2. Backtrackers 
 
Consider: 
(568) 
a. 
If John murdered his wife, he will go to prison. 
 
 
b. 
If John is a suspect, he {is / must be} ‘helping the police with their inquiries’ now. 
 
 
c. 
If John murdered his wife, the murder {will / would} have been prepared very carefully. 
 
 
d. 
If he has a key, he has made a duplicate. 
While all three examples are direct inferentials, (568c-d) differ from the first two in that their Q-situation 
temporally precedes the P-situation, rather than vice versa, as in (568a), or rather than the two situations 
being simultaneous, as in (568b). Inferentials like (568c-d) are known in the philosophical literature as 
“backtrackers” (Lewis 1991). It is typical of them that if the P-clause is interpreted as expressing a closed 
condition, the will or would in the Q-clause does not express T-posteriority but predictability. This is clear 
from (568c) and from the following: 
(569) 
If he had been chairman of the board in 1989, he would have been elected in 1988 [and that’ s not possible, 
because he wasn’t in the country that year]. 
If the condition in such examples is interpreted as closed (because the P-clause is echoic), would expresses 
predictability; if it is interpreted as counterfactual or imaginary (which is only possible if the P-clause is not 
echoic), would has a purely conditional meaning. There are also backtrackers with an open P-clause and a Q-
clause with will expressing predictability: 
(570) 
a. 
If Jill doesn’t reply [when you tell her that], you will have told the truth. 
 
 
b. 
If he comes, he will have taken precautions. 
Contrary to what is said by Funk (1985: 367), backtrackers do not necessarily express “an inverted ‘cause 
and effect’ relation”. While (570a) does suggest that Jill’s not answering will be the effect of her being told 

 
248 
the truth, we need not conclude from (568c) that, because the murder was prepared carefully, John was the 
murderer. It should also be noted that (568c-d) and (570a-b) are direct, not indirect, inferentials: P expresses 
the premise and Q the conclusion. There can certainly not be any question of ‘inverted’ (=indirect) inference 
(as in If that’s Bill Daley, I’m Shakespeare!). 
It should be noted, finally, that, unlike some other conditionals, backtrackers can only be interpreted as 
premise-expressing-P (i.e. inferential), not as actualization-conditioning-P. Consider: 
(571) 
If Peter is here, Gladys will be delighted.  (This can be read either as ‘I infer from the fact that Peter is here 
that Gladys is delighted’ or as ‘Peter’s being here will trigger Gladys’ being delighted’.) 
Backtrackers, in which the Q-situation is anterior to the P-situation, are a type of inferential conditionals 
which cannot possibly be interpreted as actualization-conditioning-P, since in actualization-conditioning-P 
conditionals, the P-situation must necessarily precede, at least in part, the Q-situation. 
 
9.2.2.3. Nonpreclusive-P inferentials 
 
If an inferential involves an even if-clause or a Q-clause containing an adversative adverb like still, 
nonetheless, etc., it has a nonpreclusive meaning. This means that there is an ‘expectation understanding’ 
‘One might expect P to preclude Q’ (=‘if P, not-Q’) and a ‘nonpreclusive understanding’ ‘P does not 
preclude Q’. In other words, while Q is not inferrable from P, and we might in fact expect not-Q to be 
inferrable from P, P does not preclude that Q is inferrable from one or more other premises—see section 
14.1.1. For example: 
(572) 
a. 
Even if he was there at the time of the murder, he didn’t do it. 
 
 
b. 
[Judge Harris is a notorious racist.] If a black defendant is innocent, he is still likely to be convicted by 
him. 
In such examples, P does not represent a suitable epistemological basis for inferring Q. Q is inferred in spite 
of P: the effect of even if or still is to indicate that Q runs counter to what we would normally expect to 
follow from P. 
 
9.2.3. Inferentials involving an inferential bridge between P and Q 
 
It was noted in section 9.2.2.1 above that conditionals with a nonassertoric interrogative Q-clause are as a 
rule utterance conditionals rather than inferentials. There is, however, an exception to this rule, viz. when 
there is an “inferential bridge” (Clark & Clark 1977) between P and Q, i.e. a missing step in the inference 
from P to Q. Compare: 
(573) 
a. 
If today’s Tuesday, you need your hat. 
 
 
b. 
If today’s Tuesday, don’t you need your hat? 
 
 
c. 
If today’s Tuesday, do you need your hat? 
 
 
d. 
If today’s Tuesday, why are you taking your hat? 
The background for (573a) and (573b) is the same, namely one in which the closed premise that it is Tuesday 
leads to the conclusion that the addressee needs his hat, say because he is a surveyor who always does site 
visits on Tuesdays, and this Tuesday he has not picked up his hat to take with him. Sentence (573c) can also 
use this background, or it can have the opposite background (in two respects), i.e. one in which Tuesday is 
the day that the surveyor always spends at the office and does not require a hat, but he has picked up his hat 
nevertheless. Sentence (573d) seems to require the same sort of context as (573c), i.e. one in which it is 
reasonable—as far as the speaker is concerned—to draw from the premise ‘today is Tuesday’ the conclusion 
that the addressee does not require his hat. But this conclusion is ‘skipped’, so to speak: the speaker assumes 
that she does not have the right conclusion to the premise and so asks for information that will explain this. 
Thus, (573d) is seen as a premise-expressing-P conditional (of which the apparent Q-clause is not the actual 
Q-clause), and is read as ‘If today is Tuesday, (it is reasonable to infer that) you don’t need your hat, so why 
are you taking it?’. A similar analysis applies to If this is Tuesday, where are we now?, except that in this 
case it seems that the speaker assumes that it is possible to come to a conclusion on the basis of the premise 
‘This is Tuesday’ (inter alia), but that instead of having the wrong conclusion, she does not have any 
conclusion at all. 
 

 
249 
9.2.4. The epistemological basis of direct inference 
 
It is typical of premise-expressing-P conditionals (=direct inferentials) that P is, or forms part of, the 
epistemological basis for inferring the truth of Q. However, as noted in section 9.2.1 above, the premise 
expressed in the P-clause need not be the only premise that the inference is based on, as long as the other 
premises are, or can be treated as,18 given (known or inferrable) information. For example: 
(574) 
If he is not married, Chris is a bachelor.  (The other premise is that Chris is a grown-up; that he is a man is 
clear from the use of ‘he’.) 
Besides, the general epistemological basis of the inference need not always be of the same kind. We can 
distinguish the following possibilities: 
 
9.2.4.1. Extrapolating from a necessary truth 
 
In some cases the speaker’s inference is an extrapolation from a general truth to a specific instantiation. An 
example of this is: 
(575) 
If the local volley-ball team have won, the team they were playing against have lost. 
The general truth underlying this inferential is an exclusive disjunction. Since in volley-ball there are only 
two possibilities (‘A have won’ and ‘B have won’), the following conditionals must both be true: 
(576) 
a. 
If A have won, B have lost. 
 
 
b. 
If A have lost, B have won. 
Sentence (575) is a conditional of type (576a). Its Q is therefore necessarily true. 
 
9.2.4.2. Extrapolating from a general pattern 
 
There are also cases in which the epistemological basis is the speaker’s pragmatic knowledge of a general 
pattern ‘if A, then B’, i.e. ‘a situation of kind A as a rule triggers a situation of kind B.’ This is the case, for 
example, in Ian will be happy if Lily comes if the inference concerning one particular occasion is based on 
the speaker’s knowledge that as a rule Ian is happy in Lily’s company. The inferential is then an 
extrapolation from a general rule to a similar statement about a specific occasion. (By ‘similar’ we mean that 
the extrapolating inferential has the same form as the conditional expressing the general rule.) In this kind of 
inferential, the P-clause is both premise-expressing and actualization-conditioning: the general rule serving 
as epistemological basis is an actualization-triggering-P conditional. (It follows that if there is no knowledge 
of a general rule serving as epistemological basis, Ian will be happy if Lily comes expresses no more than a 
prediction or expectation. In that case the conditional is actualization-conditioning-P but not premise-
expressing-P, hence not inferential.) 
 
9.2.4.3. Extrapolating via inferential bridges 
 
There are cases in which the inference still has a general rule as epistemological basis, but is more than a 
simple extrapolation from that general rule to a statement about a specific occasion. This means that the 
inference is more complex: it involves one or more inferential bridges. For example, if I know that as a rule 
Ian likes talking about interior design, or that Ian likes talking to people like himself and is an interior 
designer, then in either case, if Lily is an interior designer, I can utter Ian will be happy if Lily comes as a 
common-sense inferential (albeit not a strictly logical one), which is simultaneously actualization-triggering-
P. Likewise, if I know that it is a general rule about Lily that she always makes people happy, the conditional 
Ian will be happy if Lily comes is inferential. A similar example is the case in which I know that Lily is a 
brilliant after-dinner speaker, and say If Lily is the after-dinner speaker, you’ll enjoy the evening, which isn’t 
                                              
18 Speakers can exploit the assumption of givenness, by treating information that is not actually easily accessible to the addressee 
as given, so that the addressee is forced to fill in the inferential chain that leads the speaker to treat the information as given. 
For example, a speaker can say If the party is ‘soft drinks only’, we won’t find Jim there as a way of implying that Jim is rather 
too fond of alcohol, because an assumption along those lines is a fairly obvious candidate for one of the premises that the 
speaker is treating as given if the P-clause here is the only premise that the speaker thinks necessary to express in order to get to 
the conclusion given in Q. 

 
250 
a strictly logical inference—apart from anything else, you may only enjoy that part of the evening—but 
which is inferential in the way that we mean the term to be understood, and actualization-triggering-P. 
The difference between this type and those referred to in sections 9.2.4.1 and 9.2.4.2 is one of complexity: 
for the interior designer inference we need Ian is happy if he’s talking about interior design + Lily is an 
interior designer + if Lily comes, she will talk to Ian about interior design, etc. When we extrapolate from a 
necessary truth or general pattern, the inference goes directly from the rule A to a specific application B, 
whereas in the possibility under discussion the inference from A to B involves several intermediate steps. It 
follows that an inferential of the last type differs from an inferential extrapolating directly from a general 
pattern in that it does not have the same form as the conditional expressing the general rule. 
 
9.2.4.4. Nonextrapolating inferentials 
 
In this case the epistemological basis is neither a necessary truth nor a general rule expressible in the form of 
an actualization-triggering-P conditional. For example: 
(577) 
a. 
If you didn’t damage the curtain, it must have been the cat. 
 
 
b. 
If she told you that Tom did it, she is a liar. 
In (577a) the reasoning is as follows: ‘I know that the curtain was damaged, hence that there was some living 
being in the room that did it; apart from yourself, there was only the cat in the room; therefore, if the culprit 
is not you, it must be the cat.’ Similarly, (577b) means ‘I {know / believe} that Tom did not do it, and I 
{know / believe} that she too {knows / believes} that Tom did not do it; therefore, if she told you that Tom 
did it, she must be a liar.’ These paraphrases show that the epistemological basis is more complex than in the 
case of Ian will be happy if Lily comes. The inferential is not an extrapolation from a general rule to a 
specific case; there is no idea of a type of situation triggering a token of that type. This kind of inferential 
conditional is therefore not at the same time an actualization conditional. Like the inferentials extrapolating 
from a necessary truth, it is what we might call a ‘purely inferential’ conditional. 
Since such an inferential is not an extrapolation from a general pattern A to a specific case B, it does not 
have the same form as the conditional expressing the general rule. In this respect it differs from inferentials 
like Ian will be happy if Lily comes (when expressing a direct extrapolation from the general pattern Ian is 
happy if Lily comes to a statement about a specific occasion): in the latter type, the epistemological basis 
(general rule) is a conditional of the same form as the extrapolation. The same thing is not true of the type 
mentioned in section 9.2.4.3, which shows no direct extrapolation from rule A to application B but rather an 
inference involving one or more bridges, nor of the type under discussion in this section (9.2.4.4), which is a 
‘purely inferential’ conditional, where the epistemological basis is only made explicit in the premise given in 
the P-clause. 
 
9.2.5. Case-specifying-P conditionals that cannot be standard direct inferentials 
 
There are some cases in which a case-specifying P-clause has a particular feature that excludes the 
conditional being a standard direct inferential. A first case is when the conditional conjunction is focused by 
a focusing adverb like especially, particularly, etc.: 
(578) 
a. 
An amateur video poses fewer problems, especially if it is done in addition to professional photographs.  
(COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
At the same time, water does seem to exert a certain fascination over cats, particularly if the water 
contains a goldfish.  (COB-W) 
In these examples, the P-clauses are not interpreted as premise-expressing, even if the P-clause precedes the 
Q-clause. The reason is that the examples mean: ‘Q in various (possibly all) cases, {especially  / particularly} 
in the case P.’ In other words, the focusing adverb makes it clear that P is not the only condition for Q. This 
runs counter to the fact—see section 12.4—that the P-clause of a direct inferential is as a rule interpreted as a 
condition that is both necessary and sufficient for the conclusion that Q is true to be valid, i.e. as the only 
relevant condition for the truth of Q. (It is in keeping with this that If there’s a light on, he must be at home is 
impeccable as an inferential conditional, while ?Especially if there’s a light on he must be at home is odd.) 
In sum, a first case in which a case-specifying P-clause cannot be an inferential conditional is when the 
conditional conjunction is focused by a restrictive adverb like especially, particularly, etc. In that case the P-

 
251 
clause is not premise-expressing in the usual sense of the term, i.e. expressing the only relevant condition for 
Q, which is therefore seen as a necessary and sufficient premise for Q. Conditionals like those in (578) are 
therefore ‘purely case-specifying-P’ (see 3.8.1 above and 9.3 below) rather than inferential. 
A second case in which a case-specifying P-clause is never premise-expressing is if it represents the value 
of a specificational conditional (as in The only case in which I would consider leaving you is if I discovered 
you were having an affair). 
A third case is when the P-clause is elliptic: 
(579) 
a. 
If possible, she won’t tell the police about our relationship. 
 
 
b. 
If in doubt, you can ask for our leaflet. 
The fourth case is if the Q-clause does not have a truth value. This is the case, e.g. if the Q-clause is 
nonassertoric because it is a nonfinite clause. (There is a similar constraint on the interpretation of because-
clauses: as soon as the main clause occurs in nominalized form, inferential readings are excluded—see 
Verstraete 1998.) 
(580) 
a. 
[Next we will tell you] how to get help if you have special problems.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[The interest rate acts in that way,] by taking people out of the market if they don’t have a particularly 
good investment project.  (COB-S) 
 
 
c. 
[You just said] to give you a ring if I needed any help—[and I bloody do, OK?]  (DOC) (The Q-clause 
is an indirect directive appearing in the form of an infinitive clause.) 
Such examples are again of the ‘purely case-specifying-P’ type. 
 
9.2.6. Postscript premise-expressing P-clauses 
 
Premise-expressing P-clauses are very seldom found in postscript position. Athanasiadou & Dirven (1996: 
624) report that they have found only one example in the (limited) corpus which they have examined. 
However, in spite of their low frequency, such inferentials are quite acceptable: 
(581) 
a. 
He must be up to something, if he goes to the bank that often. 
 
 
b. 
He {isn’t / can’t be} a lawyer—if he wears such shabby clothes. 
The low frequency of such examples is probably due to the fact that they require a specific context. Thus, 
(581a) is only possible in a context in which someone has said He’s been to the bank every day this week, or 
when the speaker is looking at the subject referent’s diary and sees go to bank on each date (and assumes that 
the man actually goes on all these occasions rather than constantly having to re-enter the instruction to 
himself because he never remembers to go). As a matter of fact, these special contexts are in fact the echoic 
contexts needed for any closed-P conditional. The reason for the low frequency of such examples (as 
compared with the frequency of, say, postscript actualization-conditionals) is that if something has the nature 
of a conclusion, then the conclusion has more force if one states the premise(s) on which it is based, and it is 
thus inefficient to give the premise after the conclusion so that the addressee has to re-evaluate the Q-clause 
as a conclusion based on a specific premise (or perhaps as a conclusion at all, and not a simple assertion, 
prediction etc.). In contexts such as those given for (581a), the speaker might think that the premise is 
obvious and her (Q-clause) utterance will be understood as a conclusion based on the obvious premise, but 
then decides that the premise needs to be made explicit. 
Needless to say, such postscript premise-expressing P-clauses should not be confused with ‘restrictive 
postscript P-clauses’ (e.g. He won’t be of much help—if he comes at all) because, unlike the latter, they do 
not restrict the scope of the Q-predication. (The logical form of a restrictive postscript-P conditional is either 
‘Q, but only if P’ or ‘Q, unless P’, while that of a postscript premise-expressing-P conditional is ‘Q, if [=on 
the basis of] P.’) 
 
9.2.7. Indirect inferentials 
 
These are inferentials in which the P-clause is only ostensibly premise-expressing. It is typical of them that 
the initial interpretation in terms of an inference from P to Q must be re-interpreted as an inference from Q to 
P. We can distinguish the following subtypes. 
 
9.2.7.1. ‘Ad absurdum’ inferentials 

 
252 
 
This subtype is illustrated by the following: 
(582) 
a. 
If he passed his exam, I’m a Dutchman.  (Strawson 1952: 89) 
 
 
b. 
If Deirdre is guilty, I’m a banana!  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[“John was all on his own at Christmas.”] — “Oh come on, if John was all on his own at Christmas, I’m 
Santa Claus.” 
Here both clauses are positive, which means that P is [+p] and Q is [+q]. The case-specifying P-clause is 
ostensibly represented as a closed P-clause: for the sake of the argument, the speaker purports to assume P 
(which is somehow echoic) to be true, but then she makes it clear that this interpretation must be 
reconsidered, by uttering a Q-clause which is absurd in the actual world (and is clearly treated as such by the 
speaker): Q can only be true in an absurd (counterfactual) world. Since by implicature P and Q are normally 
interpreted in terms of the same world (see section 8.3.2), the suggestion is that P must be also be taken to be 
absurd (=not true) in the actual world. The speaker thus deliberately makes Q absurd, in order to lead the 
hearer to reason that P must be absurd. 
This kind of reasoning (‘P must be as absurd as Q’), which leads to the re-interpretation of [+p] as ‘NOT 
[+p]’, is similar to the ‘ad absurdum’ argument in mathematics, which disproves a theorem by showing that 
it leads to absurd consequences. For this reason we call conditionals like (582a-c) ‘ad absurdum 
conditionals’.19 (In logical terms, these conditionals are examples of a ‘modus tollens’ inference: if the 
‘consequent’ is not true, the ‘antecedent’ cannot be true either.) 
As noted by Akatsuka (1991: 32), what we call ad absurdum conditionals “appeal to feelings and 
emotions of discourse participants rather than logical reasoning alone.” This means that they are inferentials 
only in a weak sense of the term. It is in keeping with this that it is possible to “convey the same attitude, 
‘No, that’s absurd!’ by uttering ‘p and q’, where p is again a repetition of what the previous speaker has just 
said, and q is again blatant falsehood.” (p. 27). For example: 
(583) 
[“I’m the herald of the new Messiah.”] — “Oh, yes, you’re the herald of the new Messiah and I’m Mickey 
Mouse.”  (Akatsuka 1991: 32) 
We can add that a similar possibility exists with or—see below: 
(584) 
This is a genuine piece of 17th century Japanese pottery or I’m a Dutchman. 
The following are similar to (582a-c), except that the absurdity of Q is of a slightly different kind: 
(585) 
a. 
I may be hanged if that isn’t Tom.  (rather archaic) 
 
 
b. 
I’m damned if I’m going to break an important appointment on Monday morning to go to the bank for 
you!  (LOD) 
 
 
c. 
[He says they’re getting trying to get you to drop the complaint ... by doing that but] I’ll be buggered if 
I’m going to.  (COB-S) 
 
 
d. 
[If the police and the Medical Examiner cannot dig up enough evidence,] I’ll be damned if I’ll hold him 
till they cook up something.  (COB-W) 
An addressee who assumes that the speaker in each of these cases does not want to be hanged, buggered or 
damned will interpret the Q-clause pragmatically, not as referring to the actual world (or to a closed 
theoretical world), but rather as referring to a counterfactual world. It follows that both Q and P are 
interpreted as true in that counterfactual Q-world, hence that P (which is [-p] in (585a) and [+p] in (585b-c)) 
is taken to be false in the actual world. 
The following are some similar examples: 
(586) 
a. 
Fuck me if I’m going to lift a finger to help them.  (Quirk et al. 1985: 1095) 
 
 
b. 
{I’ll be / I’m} {blowed / darned / dashed} if I’ll do that for her! 
 
 
c. 
I’ll eat my hat if that fellow isn’t here again!  (Wood 1969) (old fashioned) 
 
 
d. 
Blow me if he didn’t hit her!  (Longman Dictionary of the English Language 1984: 729) 
Ad absurdum conditionals usually have an (ostensibly) closed P-clause: the process of inference starts from 
an echoic supposition which is temporarily presented as assumed to be true, before being cancelled by the 
                                              
19 Wu (1993: 210) calls them “rhetorical conditionals”—a term which we use in a different sense (see chapter 11). Referring to 
the example If Confucius was born in Texas, I’m Dracula, Akatsuka (1991: 25) speaks of “Dracula conditionals.” Dik (1990: 
247) uses the term “ex absurdo conditionals.” 

 
253 
obvious absurdity (counterfactuality) of Q. However, not all ad absurdum inferentials have a closed P-clause 
(which is ultimately re-interpreted as counterfactual). In fact, conditionals of the outward form of all 
nonneutral-theoretical case-specifying-P types that are not represented as counterfactual by the verb forms in 
the P- and/or Q-clauses can also be used to build an ‘ad absurdum’ reasoning: 
(587) 
a. 
If you are the new Messiah, I am Napoleon.  (closed P referring to the present; re-interpreted as 
counterfactual) 
 
 
b. 
[“I won all the fights.”] — “If you won all the fights, I am Cassius Clay.”  (Wu 1993: 210) (closed P 
referring to the past; re-interpreted as counterfactual) 
 
 
c. 
If he succeeds in doing that, I will eat my hat!  (open P referring to the post-present; re-interpreted as 
highly tentative P) 
 
 
d. 
If he succeeded in doing that, I would eat my hat!  (tentative P referring to the post-present; re-
interpreted as highly tentative P) 
However, (587c-d) are special in that the ad absurdum reasoning does not really start from a counterfactual Q 
and hence does not lead to a counterfactual interpretation of P. The reason is that both Q and P are 
interpreted as referring to the post-present. Since we can never be certain about the future, it follows that the 
conclusion from the ad absurdum argument is not that P is counterfactual but that it is expected to prove 
counterfactual. Thus, (587c) may have the form of an open-P conditional, but for pragmatic reasons P is 
interpreted as highly tentative. 
It is worth noting that speakers using an ad absurdum conditional may exploit the expectation that the 
hearer will react incredulously to some information as a rhetorical device to convey the message that this 
reaction is mistaken, i.e. that P is not false after all. For example: 
(588) 
(Radio commercial for Folgers instant coffee) If this is instant coffee, I’ll eat my hat!  (Akatsuka 1991: 28) 
The point of the commercial lies precisely in the speaker’s having taken Folgers instant coffee for freshly 
brewed coffee and thus finding P absurd, whilst the audience knows that P is not absurd. 
If P is [-p], the conclusion to be drawn from the ad absurdum conditional is that [-p] is absurd, hence that 
‘#[-p]’ (=[+p]) is true: 
(589) 
If this isn’t a genuine piece of 17th century Japanese pottery, I’m a Dutchman. 
There is nothing special about such examples. Like all ad absurdum conditionals, (589) is a way of 
suggesting that P should be taken to be false. Only, in this case P is [-p] rather than [+p]. 
A further remark is that the interpretation of an ad absurdum conditional is the same as that of the 
corresponding compound sentence in which the coordinating conjunction is or and the polarity of the first 
clause is the reverse of that of the corresponding P-clause. Thus, (589) is interpreted exactly like 
(590) 
This is a genuine piece of 17th century Japanese pottery or I’m a Dutchman. 
On the other hand, ad absurdum conditionals with or and with a negative first conjunct are hardly acceptable. 
Thus, (591a) is definitely much better than (591b): 
(591) 
a. 
If that’s John, I’m Shakespeare. 
 
 
b. 
??That’s not John or I’m Shakespeare. 
In (591b) we are given the choice between a world in which That’s not John is true or a world in which I’m 
Shakespeare is true. Rejecting the truth of one of these disjuncts entails accepting the truth of the other. If we 
reject the truth of That’s not John, we have to accept the truth of the absurd clause I’m Shakespeare. We are 
therefore led to understand that the speaker feels we should accept the truth of That’s not John. However, for 
some reason the sentence which enforces this way of reasoning is of (highly) questionable acceptability. 
Another remark on ad absurdum conditionals is that, although the inference ultimately goes from Q to P, 
the P-clause must as a rule precede the Q-clause. This is because the P-clause is typically closed and hence 
echoic: it tends to repeat (at least the gist of) what has just been said at the discourse site. The only exception 
to this is the I’ll be hanged if I’ll do that type, where the P-clause is not echoic (closed) and has to follow the 
Q-clause. 
A final point to be made about ad absurdum conditionals is that there is no similar kind of conditional 
with the opposite function. There is no a priori reason why it should be impossible to take as Q a proposition 
which can only be interpreted as true and use the ‘If P, Q’ mechanism to force the hearer to conclude that P 
must necessarily be true too. Thus, one might expect the existence of conditionals like *If there’s a mistake 

 
254 
in this bill, two and two is four, where the intended message would be: since Q is true beyond doubt, P 
(ostensibly presented as an open condition) should be interpreted as factual. In practice, there are no such 
indirect conditionals in English. If we wish an addressee to conclude the truth of a claim on the basis of the 
obvious truth of another claim, we have to process the obviously true claim (here two and two is four) as P 
rather than Q: If two and two is four, there’s a mistake in this bill. The result is a closed-P conditional (see 
section 4.1.5). (The fact that we have to process the obviously true claim as P rather than Q may have to do 
with the ‘if=iff’ implicature discussed in section 12.4.2. The pragmatically invited reading of *If there’s a 
mistake in this bill, two and two is four would be ‘Only if there’s a mistake in this bill is two and two four’, 
which is nonsensical from a pragmatic point of view.) 
 
9.2.7.2. Indirect inferentials with counterfactual verb form in the Q-clause 
 
As with ad absurdum inferentials, it is typical of these that it is the counterfactual reading of Q that produces 
the counterfactual interpretation of P. The main difference between the two is that the counterfactual reading 
of the Q-proposition is now not the result of pragmatic absurdity but is triggered by the counterfactual verb 
form of the Q-clause (i.e. by the use of the conditional perfect or of a conditional tense form referring to the 
present): 
(592) 
a. 
If my mother-in-law was coming tomorrow, I would be busy cleaning the house from top to bottom. 
 
 
b. 
If my mother-in-law wasn’t coming tomorrow, I wouldn’t have spent half the week cleaning, would I? 
The ‘#P’ interpretation in these examples is the result of the following chain of reasoning: (a) the Q-situation 
is triggered by the P-situation; (b) Q is counterfactual, i.e. true in a counterfactual world but interpreted as 
false in the actual world; (c) P and Q are by implicature interpreted in terms of the same world (see section 
8.3.2); (d) it follows from (a)-(c) that like Q, P is interpreted as true in a counterfactual world but false in the 
actual world. In (592a), P is [+p]. What is inferred from the nontruth of Q in the actual world is therefore the 
nontruth of [+p], i.e. the truth of [-p] (in the actual world). Thus the interpretation of ‘#P’ in (592a) is that my 
mother-in-law is not coming tomorrow. Similarly, the interpretation of ‘#P’ in (592b) (where P is [-p]) is that 
my mother-in-law is coming. 
Dahl (1997: 109) discusses a similar example (viz. If you earned as much as you claim you do, you would 
not go around in that old car) and calls it an example of “the everyday counterpart to the logicians’ reductio 
ad absurdum argument.” Though there is nothing wrong with this, we prefer to reserve the term ‘ad 
absurdum’ for the type described in the previous section. Otherwise we would not have a specific label for 
that type, which is formally distinct from the present type. 
 
9.2.7.3. Indirect inferentials with contradictory Q-clause 
 
In this subtype the Q-clause is not pragmatically absurd or grammatically marked as counterfactual but it is 
contradictory, i.e. semantically anomalous: 
(593) 
But Superman wouldn’t be Superman if he let this kind of injustice happen. 
Since we cannot normally envisage a conventional possible world in which ‘Superman isn’t Superman’ is 
true, Q is taken to express a contradiction. The hearer is therefore invited to reject Q, which implies treating 
the premise P as false. 
 
9.2.7.4. Assertoric interrogative Q-clause incompatible with factual P-clause 
 
In the following examples, the Q-clause is interrogative and reads as a rhetorical question: 
(594) 
a. 
And I feel that if I don’t do it, being in a relatively powerful position, who the hell else is going to?  
(COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
What’s the use of having a gun if you have no bullets? 
In (594a), Who the hell else is going to? has the form of a positive question but is interpreted as a forceful 
negative statement: ‘No one else is going to.’ Since it is clearly implied that it is unthinkable for the speaker 
that no one should do it, the Q-reading ‘No one else is going to do it’ leaves no room for interpreting P 
otherwise than as ‘I will do it.’ The following example is similar, except that the Q-clause is now a positive 
rhetorical question (which is interpreted as a negative assertion): 

 
255 
(595) 
[His explanation—that ministers have an automatic duty to sign such certificates—is implausible. 
For] if the signature is automatic, why should it need a minister to give it, rather than a junior 
official? [A ministerial signature is an assertion that it would be injurious to the public interest to 
release the documents.]  [adapted from COB-W] 
In this context, the Q-clause is clearly interpreted as a rhetorical question. The conditional is read: ‘Surely, if 
the signature were automatic, it would not need a minister to give it, rather than a junior official.’ This 
interpretation is based on the following reasoning: (a) apparently, ministers sign such certificates; (b) 
ministers would not have to sign them if the signature were automatic; (c) hence the assertion that the 
signature is automatic is false. 
As a final illustration of an indirect inferential with a rhetorical question as Q-clause, consider the 
following: 
(596) 
a. 
If YOU can’t do it, who can? 
 
 
b. 
Who can do it if not you? 
These are normally interpreted as ‘If YOU can’t do it, nobody can’, i.e. the intended message is ‘I am sure 
you can do it.’ (This mechanism is not unlike what we observe in ad absurdum examples: since the 
consequent (Q) ‘nobody can do it’ is assumed to be false, the premise (P) ‘you can’t do it’ is also assumed to 
be false. Hence the message is ‘You can do it.’)20 This shows again that when the Q-clause is a question that 
is interpreted rhetorically, with the understood assertion negative, the pragmatic function of the conditional 
as a whole may be that of an indirect denial of the truth of the P-clause. 
However, this is not true of all examples that have a positive rhetorical question as Q-clause. In 
(597) 
If YOU can’t do it, how do you expect SAM to (be able to) do it? 
the understood Q-assertion is ‘you cannot expect Sam to (be able to) do it,’ but there is no denial of the truth 
of the P-clause, because this Q-assertion is not assumed to be false. In this case there is no indirect inference 
(‘Q is false, hence P must be false too’) but a direct inference (‘If [-p], then [-q]’). 
Conditionals with a rhetorical question as Q-clause are not the only type of interrogative-Q conditional 
that can be interpreted as a counterfactual indirect inferential because P is incompatible with Q. The 
following represent another subtype: 
(598) 
a. 
If John is so clever (as you claim), how come he isn’t rich? 
 
 
b. 
If John is so clever (as you claim), why is he so poor? 
 
 
c. 
If you’re so bright, how come you aren’t running Unilever?  (COB-W) 
These sentences differ from all the above cases of indirect inferentials in that the relevant Q-proposition, 
which is either [-q] (He is not rich) or [+q] (He is poor / You are bright), is not counterfactual. However, as 
in all the other cases, the speaker obviously treats Q as incompatible with P. Thus, (598a-b) convey the 
speaker’s opinion that being clever is incompatible with being poor. The factuality of Q (‘He is poor’) 
therefore leads her to conclude that P (‘He is clever’) must be false. 
 
9.2.8. Pseudo-Q inferentials 
 
To close off section 9.2 (on inferentials), we would like to point out that there are many inferentials which at 
first sight do not seem to be so because the Q-clause expressing the conclusion is missing: the overt Q-clause 
is a pseudo-Q-clause (see section 3.12) expressing the reason for concluding the contents of the covert Q-
                                              
20 The reason why who can? is interpreted as ‘nobody can’—more generally, the reason why rhetorical questions are interpreted 
as statements with the opposite polar value—must be a pragmatic implicature, for, although the question does not invite an 
answer, it can actually be given one. (However, if the ‘answerer’ did so, the ‘questioner’ would legitimately feel that the 
answerer had deliberately and perversely interpreted the question literally, and not as it was intended. That is, the reply would 
be an obvious breach of Grice’s “cooperative speaker” principle. This shows that the interpretation of who can? is clearly a 
pragmatic matter.) 
 
   The pragmatic mechanism engendering the interpretation ‘nobody can’ for ‘who can?’ might be as follows. The question who 
can? implies ‘I don’t know anyone equally qualified’—otherwise the speaker would not ask the question. If the speaker 
considers herself authoritative and well-informed, the suggestion ‘nobody knows anyone equally qualified’ may follow. (This 
might have to do with the Maxim of relevance: a speaker as a rule considers herself the most relevant person.) It is then a small 
step from ‘nobody knows anyone equally qualified to do it’ to the suggestion ‘no one else can do it’. 

 
256 
clause. That is, the overt Q-clause functions as the protasis of an inferential process whose apodosis is a 
covert Q-clause: 
(599) 
a. 
Oh WELL, if she phoned me YESterday, I was in LONdon.  (=If she phoned me yesterday she {didn’t get / 
won’t have got} an answer because I was in London.) 
 
 
b. 
[“I didn’t know about the accident until just now.” — “I don’t believe you. I asked my wife yesterday to 
ring you up at once and tell you about it.”] — “If she phoned me yesterday, I was abroad.”  (=If she 
phoned me yesterday she can’t have {reached / told} me, because I was abroad.) 
The fact that we cannot insert then before the overt Q-clause would seem to disprove the view that these 
conditionals are inferentials. However, the only reason why then is unacceptable here is that the overt Q-
clause does not express the conclusion of the inferential process. 
 
9.3. Purely case-specifying-P conditionals 
 
Next to actualization conditionals and inferentials, these form the third subtype of case-specifying-P 
conditionals. Purely case-specifying-P conditionals are conditionals in which the P-clause just specifies the 
case(s) in which (or the circumstances under which) the Q-situation actualizes, or the case(s) in which Q is 
true. They do not have the causal, preclusive, nonpreclusive, etc. connotation of implicative conditionals 
(=actualization conditionals + inferentials). It is typical of them that when can often be substituted for if with 
no or little difference of meaning. 
(600) 
a. 
{When / If} you come to think of it, there’s a lot of truth in what he says. 
 
 
b. 
(hospital regulation)  If you’re wearing your own nightie, wear a short-sleeved one.  (COB-S) 
 
9.3.1. Purely case-specifying-P conditionals specifying the circumstances under which the Q-situation 
actualizes 
 
This subtype is illustrated by the following: 
(601) 
a. 
If you are shot at, this bullet-proof jacket will protect you.  (This is interpreted as a pseudo-Q 
conditional: ‘If you are shot at, you will not be hurt because this bullet-proof jacket will protect you.’) 
 
 
b. 
(said by a left-handed speaker)  If I’m cutting bread I get remarks about “oh don’t you look awkward.”  
(COB-S) 
 
 
c. 
[The actors may well be able to go home (and, of course, to have a meal), but] the production team—
and certainly the director—have many more hours to put in (especially if they are working on a weekly 
series) before they are able to do the same thing.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
A birthing chair ... will give you a bit of leverage if you squat during delivery.  (COB-S) 
 
 
e. 
Supplemental vitamins are helpful if there is a dietary deficiency [more probable in kids and older 
people, often on silly diets].  (COB-W) 
In some of these examples there may be a slight connotation of ‘actualization-conditioning-P’ and/or 
‘premise-expressing-P’. As a matter of fact, the distinction between the three is sometimes difficult to make: 
(602) 
If you love her, set her free. If she loves you, she will gladly return to you. If she doesn’t, she never really 
loved you anyway.  (DOC) 
The first conditional is noninferential (because of the imperative form of the Q-clause) and purely case-
specifying. The third is clearly inferential: it is a ‘backtracker’ (see section 9.2.2.2). The problem is the 
second. The P-clause seems to be ‘actualization-conditioning’ (or perhaps ‘purely case-specifying’) and 
‘premise-expressing’ at the same time. (Placing the temporal focus on the post-present brings out the 
actualization-conditioning interpretation; both this and the premise-expressing interpretation are available if 
loves is interpreted as referring to the present.) Apparently, one meaning-related function does not 
necessarily exclude the other. This conclusion (already arrived at in section 9.2 above) is further illustrated 
by the following: 
(603) 
If we don’t get some money soon, we’re going to be in trouble.  (The P-clause is both actualization-
conditioning and premise-expressing.) 
Needless to say, our analysis is at odds with Sweetser (1990), who says (p. 125) that you can have ambiguity 
between different “domain” interpretations, but not an interpretation simultaneously in two “domains”. Here, 

 
257 
we are saying that what for Sweetser would be a “content-domain” interpretation coexists with what for her 
would be an “epistemic-domain” interpretation. 
 
9.3.2. Purely case-specifying P-clauses specifying the case(s) in which Q is true 
 
There are purely case-specifying P-clauses which specify the case(s) in which the Q-proposition (whether 
[+q] or [-q]) is true. In these conditionals, the Q-clause is typically stative, and the P-clause is not premise-
expressing. As before, if is often virtually interchangeable with when. A further characteristic is that the Q-
clause cannot normally be introduced by then. Then is equivalent to ‘in that case’ and can in principle be 
found after actualization-conditioning P-clauses, premise-expressing P-clauses, and purely case-specifying P-
clauses that specify the circumstances under which the Q-situation actualizes:21 
(604) 
a. 
But if you had a threatened miscarriage, with some internal bleeding, perhaps, then they might well get 
you into there for observation.  (DOC) (actualization-conditioning-P) 
 
 
b. 
If cleanliness were next to saintliness, then this lady was probably on the verge of beatification.  (DOC) 
(premise-expressing-P) 
 
 
c. 
If you’re wearing your own nightie, then wear a short-sleeved one.  (COB-W) (purely case-specifying 
P; the cases in question concern the actualization of the Q-situation) 
 
 
d. 
{If / When} you travel to Calcutta, (*then) there is an awful lot of poverty.  (purely case-specifying P; 
the cases in question concern the truth of Q) 
Within the class of purely case-specifying P-clauses specifying the cases(s) in which the Q-proposition is 
true we can distinguish the following possibilities: 
 
9.3.2.1. Purely case-specifying P-clause specifying the circumstances under which the perception of the Q-
situation may take place 
 
(605) 
a. 
If you look on the higher beds there is a birthing chair.  (adapted from COB-S) (=there’s a birthing 
chair, which you’ll see if you look on the higher beds) 
 
 
b. 
If you listen carefully, the cello comes in just behind the rest of the orchestra. 
Some of these if-clauses suggest the idea of a travelling observing consciousness: 
(606) 
a. 
[Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in ‘Sugar Ditch,’ but] if you travel to 
Washington, Boston, Chicago or New York, the same problems exist.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
Marjorca has a wealth of well-kept secrets, particularly if you head inland.  (COB-W) 
In this class of purely case-specifying-P conditionals, there is some kind of cause-effect relation, but the 
‘effect’ is not, as it is in actualization-triggering-P conditionals, part of the propositional content of Q: it 
concerns some deictic phenomenon in the Q-clause. The ‘if...then’ relation is not between two actualizations 
but between the truth of P (which concerns an action to be performed) and the correct referent-assignment of 
the place variable in the Q-proposition, which is not given a deictic value in the Q-clause itself: it is the P-
clause which specifies the place(s) where the Q-situation actualizes. 
The following are similar examples with when or as: 
(607) 
a. 
[As to Saxon times,] when you leave the Thames, there is scanty evidence.  (Edgren 1971: 83) 
 
 
b. 
As you open the door, you are in a small five-by-five room which is a small closet. When you get past 
there, you’re in what we call the foyer...  (Linde & Labov 1975: 929) 
 
9.3.2.2. Purely case-specifying P-clause defining the conditions under which one comes to the conclusion 
that Q is true 
 
(608) 
a. 
If one considers the problems they were facing, it was not surprising that they failed. 
 
 
b. 
Communist techniques, if their background is studied, remain police methods.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
If you think about it, some of the technology we use every day would have been unheard of 10 years 
ago.  (COB-W) 
                                              
21 The use of then as connective between a conditional clause and its head clause is subject to constraints, which we will not go 
into in this book. For a discussion of the meaning of then and the conditions under which it can be used, see Dancygier & 
Sweetser (1997), Hegarty (1996) and Iatridou (1991, 1994). 

 
258 
 
 
d. 
If one looks at the wider picture, ...  then charities have generally received an awful lot of money back 
from the lottery.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
[The Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds ... are members of a cluster called 
the Local Group.] Local? Yes, if you consider that the nearest other such cluster to us is about 60 
million light-years away.  (COB-W) 
In such sentences too, the if-clause can easily be replaced by a when-clause. Conversely, in the following 
examples we could use if instead of when, with very little (if any) change in meaning: 
(609) 
a. 
When you look at the economics, Traub needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it work.  
(WSJ) 
 
 
b. 
When you consider that the Cananea mine in Mexico is still out and there still are other mine 
production problems around the world, there remains a strong bullish element in this market.  (WSJ) 
 
 
c. 
White people, it seemed, when one looked into it, did much the same things as Africans, though in a 
less reasonable fashion.  (LOB) 
 
 
d. 
The Liberal achievement is all the more remarkable when one remembers the disadvantages under 
which the Liberal candidates worked.  (LOB) 
 
 
e. 
Henry Moore’s stylisation is entirely consistent when one recognises that...  (LOB) 
 
9.3.2.3. Purely case-specifying P-clause merely specifying the cases in which Q is true 
 
There are also case-specifying P-clauses that do no more than specify the case(s) in which the Q-proposition 
(expressed by a stative Q-clause) is true. Here again, if is similar (but not always identical) in meaning to 
when: 
(610) 
a. 
[There are two kinds of houses in this street.] If there is no front garden, the front door leads into a 
hallway. If there is a front garden, the front door leads directly into the sitting-room.  (In an example 
like this, both P and Q have an independently determinable truth value.) 
 
 
b. 
[Or take a group of three words ‘nave’, ‘chancel’ and ‘transept’. I can’t think of any good reason for 
leaving out one of the three. And ‘transept’ is the one that isn’t in. Er ‘nave’ is obviously going to be in 
but] if it comes to a choice between ‘transept’ and ‘chancel’ I can see no reason to discriminate in 
favour of ‘chancel’.  (COB-S) (Notice that unlike ‘if’, ‘when’ would have the rather odd effect of at 
least possibly suggesting that lexicographers regularly have to choose between including ‘chancel’ or 
including ‘transept’.) 
 
 
c. 
Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making.  (WSJ) (‘If’ 
would be odd here because it would not carry the connotation conveyed by ‘when’ that this situation—
of being only one out of 535 because national policy making is at issue—actually happens.) 
Some purely case-specifying P-clauses of this type have a ‘set-restricting-P’ flavour (see section 9.3.2.4 
below). In Jim is a reliable chap {if / when} it comes to picking up a small tip, the function of the {if / when}-
clause seems to be similar to the set-restricting-P function of the {if / when}-clause in Children are orphans 
{if / when} their parents are dead, in that it also restricts the applicability of the predicate is a reliable chap 
to Jim. The only difference is that what is restricted is not a set. Otherwise, the P-clause has the same 
restrictive function: ‘Jim-in-the-circumstance-of-picking-up-small-tips is a reliable chap.’ 
 
9.3.2.4. Set-identifying P-clauses 
 
The term ‘set-identifying P-clause’ was introduced in section 3.9. Set-identifying-P-conditionals form a 
subtype of purely case-specifying-P conditionals. What is special about them is that the specification of the 
relevant cases happens through the restriction of a set referred to in the Q-clause (if if is used) or through the 
exclusion of a subset (if unless is used). In the following examples, the set in question is the set of cars 
(referred to by the generic noun phrase ‘a car’ in the Q-clause). The (state-expressing) if-clause in (611a) is 
‘set-restricting’ because it restricts the scope of the Q-predication to a subset of this set, viz. to the subset of 
cars whose brakes do not work; the unless-clause in (611b) is ‘subset-excluding’ because it excludes from 
the set of cars to which the Q-predication applies those cars whose brakes work: 
(611) 
a. 
A car is little use if its brakes don’t work.  (The P-situation is a habitual characteristic, i.e. a state.) 
 
 
b. 
A car is little use unless its brakes work.  (id.) 

 
259 
The set-restricting function of the if-clause of (611a) is apparent from the fact that the if-clause can be 
replaced by a restrictive relative clause without apparent change of meaning. (There is some difference of 
meaning, however—see Declerck 1988a and Ziv 1997.) 
(612) 
A car whose brakes don’t work is little use. 
Some further examples: 
(613) 
a. 
Children are orphans if they have no parents. 
 
 
b. 
Tourists often get lost here if they haven’t hired an experienced guide.  (=Many tourists who haven’t 
hired an experienced guide get lost here.) 
 
 
c. 
A person is a pacifist if they are against any form of violence. 
 
 
d. 
In many of the cases observed the wife was easily depressed if the husband held an important office. 
 
 
e. 
There is rarely a dull moment in your life if you’re interested in people. 
 
 
f. 
If the heir to the throne is not very intelligent, he is likely to have difficulties with the army. 
In such examples, if can always be replaced with ‘atemporal’ or ‘restrictive’ when—see Carlson (1979), 
Farkas & Sugioka (1983), Declerck (1988a) and Ziv (1997) for more detailed analyses of such if / when-
clauses— and sometimes by whenever or in {a case / cases} where: 
(614) 
a. 
We cannot speak of a case of smallpox {if / when} the patient does not have these symptoms. 
 
 
b. 
[Tom says] dogs are intelligent {if / when} they have blue eyes. 
 
 
c. 
Such measures apply {if / in cases where} the woman is a widow. 
 
 
d. 
Youngsters become more ‘courageous’ {when / whenever / if} they feel themselves part of a group. 
Not every Q-clause involving a noun phrase referring to a set can be followed by a set-identifying P-clause. 
(For example, we cannot say *A certain girl is an orphan if her parents are dead or *Two children are 
orphans unless they have parents.) The criterial condition for a postposed P-clause to be interpreted as set-
identifying is that the noun phrase referring to the set that is to be identified has ‘unbounded’ (unspecified 
and unrestricted) reference, i.e. that it refers to a set or mass without specifying the boundaries of the set or 
mass. This is the case in the above examples (613a-f) and (614a-d): in (613a-c) and (614b-d), the noun 
phrase has generic (or at least general) reference; in (613d), the idea of an unbounded set is evoked by a 
combination of the husband with in many of the cases observed; in (613e), you is an indefinite pronoun that 
refers to people generally; in (613f), the heir to the throne is an ‘opaque noun phrase’ (i.e. it refers, not to a 
particular individual, but to anyone satisfying the description at any time); and in (614a) a case of smallpox 
does not refer to a particular case, since the sentence has a habitual meaning (paraphrasable as ‘we can never 
speak of a case of smallpox when the patient does not have these symptoms’). In sum, for a set-restricting (or 
more generally, set-identifying—for the same applies to subset-excluding P-clauses) interpretation to be 
possible, it is required that the relevant noun phrase has unbounded reference, i.e. that it refers to a set or 
mass whose boundaries are not specified or restricted by a constituent of the noun phrase itself. In practice 
this means that the requirement is that the referent of the noun phrase is a ‘homogeneous’ set or mass, i.e. 
that not only the whole set or mass but also parts of it can be named by means of the noun phrase in question. 
For example, we can use the noun phrase (some) bears to refer to the whole of a particular group of bears, 
but we can also use it to refer to, say, half of that group. The reason why the relevant noun phrase in a 
sentence with a set-restricting if / when-clause must refer homogeneously is that, because the if / when-clause 
restricts the Q-proposition’s “admissible cases”, which Lewis (1975: 9) defines as “n-tuples of participants, 
times, and possibly other variables”, the if / when-clause indirectly restricts the set or mass that is referred to 
by the relevant noun phrase in the Q-clause. Consider, for example, the following: 
(615) 
a. 
Cats are beautiful. 
 
 
b. 
Cats are beautiful if they have white fur. 
Sentence (615a) makes a statement about a set that is defined by the generic description cats. In (615b) the 
set-restricting P-clause restricts the scope of the Q-predication to only a subset of this set. This subset can be 
indicated by the same description (cats) plus a restrictive relative clause: ‘cats that have white fur’. This 
means that not only the set as a whole but also the relevant subset consists of entities that can be referred to 
as ‘cats’. This is what is meant by ‘homogeneous reference’: one and the same noun phrase (cats) can be 
used to refer both to a set as a whole and to a subset of this. Now, the condition of homogeneous reference is 
only satisfied by ‘unbounded’ noun phrases, i.e. noun phrases that do not specify a number or quantity. A 
noun phrase like twelve cats is not unbounded, and hence does not refer homogeneously: the noun phrase can 

 
260 
indicate a set as a whole, but no subset of this set. In consequence, a clause predicating something of this set 
cannot be accompanied by a P-clause restricting the scope of the predication to just a subset of this set. The 
following sentence does not yield a set-restricting-P reading: 
(616) 
*Twelve cats are beautiful {if / when} they have white fur.  (The sentence is only acceptable if the ‘when’-
clause is interpreted as time-specifying.) 
The clearest examples of unbounded noun phrases are those that contain no determiner at all, i.e. bare plurals 
and bare mass noun phrases. Noun phrases referring to a species or kind, as in This (kind of) dog has long 
ears, are also unbounded, since the kind is represented by an unspecified number of members, and the same 
is true of generic noun phrases, indefinite pronouns like you or one, and definite noun phrases that have 
opaque reference (e.g. the heir to the throne). Typical examples of bounded noun phrases are nongeneric 
noun phrases with the indefinite article and plural indefinites involving precise quantifiers such as numerals. 
Definite noun phrases (with nonopaque reference) are also normally interpreted as bounded, because they are 
by implicature interpreted as referring to all the members of a well-defined set—see Declerck (1987) and the 
discussion of the example with clear away the glasses in section 4.6.1. On the other hand, this implicature of 
‘inclusive’ reference (=reference-to-all) may be blocked by pragmatic knowledge, as in The tiles have cracks 
in them (which is normally read as ‘Some / many of the tiles have cracks in them’). In that case, the plural 
definite noun phrase receives an unbounded interpretation. The same is true when the implicature is 
cancelled, e.g. by the addition of a set-restricting if / when-clause: 
(617) 
a. 
Eliot’s books are boring {if / when} they are over 400 pages long. 
 
 
b. 
There are many stone circles—we call them standing stones even when they are recumbent.  (Edgren 
1971: 228) 
However, we cannot systematically add set-restricting clauses to definite noun phrases. Because the 
inclusiveness implicature (i.e. definiteness implicates reference-to-all) is conventionalized to a certain 
degree, it is not always easy to cancel it, particularly if there is a restrictive modifier. Noun phrases like the 
girls in the corner may be hard to interpret as noninclusive (and hence unbounded), so that the degree of 
acceptability (on the set-restricting reading of the P-clause) of sentences like the following is rather low: 
(618) 
The girls in the corner are intelligent if they have blue eyes. 
(Naturally, the intended reading becomes more readily available if the girls in the corner constitute a 
relatively large group. An unbounded interpretation is then easier than if there are only two or three girls 
there.) 
Summarizing the above paragraphs, we can say that, in sentences with a set-identifying P-clause 
containing a pro-form that refers back to a noun phrase in the Q-clause, the ‘antecedent’ noun phrase must 
have unbounded reference. At least, this is a condition that has to be fulfilled if the P-clause is to be 
interpreted as defining a subset of the set of entities referred to by the noun phrase in question (i.e. if the 
‘cases’ defined by the P-clause are the different entities belonging to this subset). 
However, this is not the only condition. Not only the ‘antecedent’ noun phrase but also the Q-clause as a 
whole must be unbounded. That is, the Q-clause must refer to an unbounded number of (possibly W-
simultaneous) situations. This is the case in a sentence like (619a), where the reference is to an unbounded 
number of situations of one sailor being intelligent, but not in (619b), where the reference is to a single 
situation of several sailors being in the next room: 
(619) 
a. 
Sailors are intelligent when they have blue eyes. 
 
 
b. 
Sailors were in the next room when the crime occurred. 
 
 
c. 
*Sailors are now in the next room when they have blue eyes. 
Carlson (1979: 52) concludes from examples like (619b) that “the main clause (or, more accurately, the 
predicate of the main clause) must be interpreted generically, and not as an ‘event’.” However, it is 
unboundedness rather than genericness that is required, for the following sentences yield the relevant set-
restricting reading of the P-clause although the Q-clause is not generic: 
(620) 
a. 
[The social workers sometimes told the pregnant women about the dangers of smoking.] {If / When} 
the mother understood this, she sometimes gave up smoking, [but in most cases she did not]. 
 
 
b. 
In most of the cases examined, the dog was expensive if it was a rare breed. 
 
 
c. 
[You can be sure that] if a man around here has sex appeal, Mary has photographed him. 
 
 
d. 
In all 54 cases examined the wolf was intelligent if it had blue eyes and stupid when it had brown eyes. 

 
261 
What is common to generic sentences and the nongeneric (620a-d) is that in each case the Q-clause refers to 
an unbounded number of situations. This is obvious where generic sentences are concerned, but should also 
be clear as regards examples like (620a-d): (620a) does not specify how many situations there were of a 
mother giving up smoking. Similarly, (620b) does not tell us in how many cases the dog was expensive, and 
we do not know from (620c) how many situations there have been of Mary photographing a man with sex 
appeal. Even in (620d), where the number of cases examined is specified, it is not specified in how many of 
these cases the wolf was intelligent and in how many cases it was stupid. So, the constraint on Q-clauses 
supporting set-restricting P-clauses (as well as subset-excluding ones) is that the number of situations (cases) 
that they refer to should not be represented as bounded. The Q-clauses need not be generic, though they 
certainly come up to the requirement if they are. 
The requirement that the Q-clause be unbounded automatically explains why the relevant set-identifying 
interpretation of the P-clause is blocked when the Q-clause involves an adverbial that is a precise quantifier 
(i.e. that specifies the number of the situations), and is not blocked when the Q-clause involves an adverbial 
that functions as an indefinite quantifier: 
(621) 
a. 
Bears have always proved intelligent if they had blue eyes. 
 
 
b. 
*Bears have proved intelligent fourteen times if they had blue eyes. 
Whereas (621a) can be interpreted as (622a), (621b) cannot be interpreted as (622b): 
(622) 
a. 
All bears that had blue eyes have proved intelligent. 
 
 
b. 
Fourteen bears that had blue eyes have proved intelligent. 
Another thing that is explained by the unboundedness condition is that most conditionals with set-identifying 
P-clauses are interpreted generically. Declerck (1991c) argues that genericness follows automatically from 
unboundedness if there are no pragmatic factors blocking it. This means that a generic reading of a sentence 
is excluded if there is reference to a bounded number of cases, and that, moreover, there is a conversational 
principle, viz. an implicature due to Grice’s Maxim of Quantity (part 1), which says that, if there is no 
indication of bounding either inside or outside the sentence, the hearer has a right to infer that the sentence is 
about an unbounded number of cases, i.e. is a generic sentence. In other words, an unbounded sentence 
automatically yields a generic interpretation unless there are contextual, situational or other pragmatic factors 
that make clear that the reference is to a particular case or set of cases. When applied to sentences with a set-
identifying P-clause, this principle predicts that the Q-clause (because it is unbounded) will be interpreted 
generically unless this interpretation is pragmatically or contextually excluded. This prediction is borne out 
by our corpus research, for nearly all the examples we have found are generic. If a set-identifying-P 
conditional is not generic, it is because a generic interpretation is somehow excluded by an element in the 
sentence itself or in the context. For example, in Dogs are sometimes unpredictable if they have blue eyes, 
the subject noun phrase, although unbounded, is not interpreted as generic because it is existentially 
quantified by the selective adverb sometimes: ‘dogs...sometimes’ is equivalent to ‘some dogs’. In (620a-d) 
there are pragmatic factors that rule out a generic interpretation of the unbounded subject noun phrase and 
hence of the Q-clause as a whole.22 
It should be noted, finally, that the requirement of unboundedness holds good not only for the Q-clause 
but also for the set-restricting P-clause itself. Compare: 
(623) 
a. 
Dogs are intelligent if they come here for food. 
 
 
b. 
*Dogs are intelligent if they come here for food tomorrow morning. 
Unlike (623a), (623b) has no suitable set-restricting-P reading. The reason is simply that the Q-clause cannot 
be unbounded when it is linked up with a bounded P-clause (i.e. a P-clause that is not generic or habitual but 
refers to a specific number of situations). In cases where the relevant noun phrase does not occur in the Q-
clause but in the P-clause, both the noun phrase and the P-clause must again be unbounded. Compare: 
(624) 
a. 
If a person hates violence, he is a pacifist. 
 
 
b. 
If John hates violence, he is a pacifist. 
                                              
22 In sum, the theory that is offered here traces genericness back to the unbounded nature of the sentence, and not to the presence 
of a hidden generic verb phrase operator, such as Carlson’s (1979) “GN”, or to a hidden generic quantifier, such as Farkas & 
Sugioka’s (1983) “G” or Lawler’s (1973) “generic quantifier”. 

 
262 
The P-clause of (624b) does not yield a set-restricting interpretation similar to that of (624a). In (624a) the 
cases defined are the persons who hate violence and of whom it can be said that they are pacifists. In (624b), 
the cases defined are the times when John hates violence. In this case the P-clause does not restrict a set of 
people, because neither the P-clause nor the Q-clause contain a subject noun phrase that is interpreted as 
having unbounded reference. 
The general conclusion from the above paragraphs is that set-identifying P-clauses define “admissible 
cases” (Lewis 1975) and that a general condition for their use is that the number of cases must remain 
unbounded. 
Set-identifying-P conditionals are purely case-specifying-P in that they specify the case(s) in which the Q-
situation (which is typically a characteristic, i.e. a state) actualizes. Because of their gnomic meaning, the P-
clause expresses a ‘neutral’ condition. That is, the conditional reveals no presupposition as to whether, at the 
time indicated by the tense, the condition is actually fulfilled, not fulfilled, etc. in the real world. 
(Theoretically speaking, it is possible that there are no children that are orphans in the present actual world. 
This possibility may run counter to our pragmatic knowledge, but this is irrelevant to the question under 
discussion.) 
One of the features of a set-identifying P-clause is that it typically follows the Q-clause. Fronting of the P-
clause is only exceptionally possible, in two cases. The first is illustrated by sentences like If children have 
no parents, they’re orphans, where the unbounded set-denoting noun phrase appears in the P-clause and is 
referred back to by an anaphoric pronoun in the Q-clause. The second exception is when the P-clause 
contains a pronoun that is coreferential with the set-denoting noun phrase in the Q-clause: {If they have no 
parents / unless they have parents}, children are orphans. However, in both exceptions the P-clause no 
longer seems to be purely set-identifying. The sentence If children have no parents, they’re orphans is also 
inferential, whereas the P-clause of If they have no parents, children are orphans is also actualization-
conditioning in that it expresses a condition for the actualization of the state expressed in the Q-clause. 
A final remark is that, because subset-excluding P-clauses and set-restricting P-clauses represent two 
different ways of identifying a set, they are not always equally felicitous. Consider, for example, the 
following: 
(625) 
a. 
Landmines mutilate people unless they fail to explode.  (The P-clause excludes the subset of landmines 
that do not explode from the set of landmines of which it is said that they mutilate people.) 
 
 
b. 
Landmines mutilate people if they explode. 
Because unless is equivalent to ‘except if’, (625a) suggests that it is normal for landmines to mutilate people 
and exceptional for them not to explode. Sentence (625b) suggests the opposite. There is a similar difference 
between (626a) and (626b), which means that the former is pragmatically less acceptable than the latter, 
because what is suggested by (626a) runs counter to our pragmatic knowledge of the world: 
(626) 
a. 
Children are orphans unless they have parents.  (suggests that it is the unmarked situation for children 
to be orphans) 
 
 
b. 
Children are orphans if they have no parents.  (suggests that it is the unmarked situation for children to 
have parents) 
 
9.4. Conclusion 
 
The purpose of this chapter has been to present and examine in detail the typology of case-specifying P-
clauses. 
(a) ‘Actualization conditionals’ have been defined as case-specifying-P conditionals which express a 
condition for the actualization of the Q-situation. On the basis of their interpretation, we have distinguished 
between five subtypes: the P-clause may be ‘actualization-triggering’, ‘preclusive’, ‘actualization-licensing’, 
‘nonpreclusive’, or have an ‘in case’ meaning. These five subtypes have been discussed in some detail. We 
have also made a distinction between ‘prerequisite-P’ and ‘restrictive postscript-P’ actualization-
conditionals. 
(b) ‘Inferential conditionals’ are concerned with the validity of an inferential reasoning process involving 
both P and Q rather than with the relation between the actualization of the P-situation and that of the Q-
situation. In the section devoted to them we have discussed the following topics: 

 
263 
(i) In ‘direct inferentials’, P is presented as the starting-point (premise) of an inferential reasoning process 
which leads to the conclusion Q. We have identified three subtypes, viz. ‘standard direct inferentials’, 
‘backtrackers’, and ‘nonpreclusive-P inferentials’. 
(ii) Some inferentials involve an ‘inferential bridge’ between P and Q. 
(iii) As regards the epistemological basis of direct inference, a distinction has been made between 
‘extrapolating conditionals’ (which extrapolate from a necessary truth, a general pattern, or via 
inferential bridges) and ‘nonextrapolating inferentials’. 
(iv) There are some cases in which the case-specifying P-clause has a particular feature that excludes it from 
being an inferential conditional. 
(v) Postscript premise-expressing P-clauses are rarely found, but not ungrammatical. 
(vi) In ‘indirect inferentials’, the P-clause is only ostensibly premise-expressing. The initial interpretation in 
terms of an inference from P to Q must be re-interpreted as an inference from Q to P. We have 
distinguished the following subtypes: ad absurdum inferentials, indirect inferentials with a 
counterfactual verb form in the Q-clause, indirect inferentials with a contradictory Q-clause, and 
indirect inferentials with an assertoric interrogative Q-clause which is incompatible with the factual P-
clause. 
(vii) ‘Pseudo-Q inferentials’ at first sight do not seem to be inferentials because the Q-clause expressing the 
conclusion is missing: the overt Q-clause is a pseudo-Q-clause interpreted as expressing the reason for 
the situation of the covert Q-clause. 
(c) ‘Purely case-specifying-P conditionals’ are conditionals in which the P-clause just specifies the case(s) in 
which (or the circumstances under which) the Q-situation actualizes, or the case(s) in which Q is true. They 
do not have the causal, preclusive, nonpreclusive, etc. connotation of implicative conditionals (=actualization 
conditionals and inferentials). Within the set of purely case-specifying-P conditionals specifying the case(s) 
in which Q is true we have distinguished a number of subtypes, one of which consists of ‘set-identifying-P 
conditionals’.

Chapter 10 
 
Rhetorical conditionals 
 
 
 
In the previous chapter we discussed case-specifying-P conditionals, which have a P-clause that is either 
‘actualization-conditioning’ (e.g. I’ll smack you if you don’t do as I say!), ‘premise-expressing’ (e.g. If this isn’t 
the boss, it must be someone else), or ‘purely case-specifying’ (e.g. What we teach them is useful if they later go 
to university). In this chapter we will investigate ‘rhetorical conditionals’,1 i.e. conditionals whose P-clause has 
none of these case-specifying meanings and conditionals whose case-specifying-P meaning is subservient to a 
particular rhetorical function of the P-clause or the Q-clause.2 
 
10.1. Utterance conditionals 
 
In a sense these resemble case-specifying-P conditionals. What is special about them, however, is that the cases 
identified by the P-clause are not the cases in which Q is claimed to be true or in which the Q-situation is 
claimed to actualize, but the cases in which it is possible, meaningful or relevant to utter the Q-clause. We will 
call the P-clause ‘utterance-licensing’ and refer to the conditional as a whole as an ‘utterance conditional’. 
 
10.1.1. Relevance conditionals 
 
It is criterial of these utterance conditionals that the P-clause, which we will refer to as ‘relevance-expressing’, 
explains the relevance of uttering the Q-clause.3 More specifically, the P-clause expresses the condition under 
which it is pragmatically relevant for the speaker to utter (and for the hearer to decode) the Q-clause.4 For 
example: 
(627) 
a. 
I am not a coward, if that is what you think.  (The P-clause explains why the speaker utters the Q-clause.) 
 
 
b. 
(entering someone’s room) Oh, if you have a visitor, I can come back later.  (The P-clause explains why the 
speaker makes the Q-clause suggestion / offer.) 
 
 
c. 
There are biscuits on the sideboard if you want them.  (Austin 1970: 210) 
 
 
d. 
If you’re hungry, there is food in the fridge.  (Geis 1973: 233) (According to Geis, “the antecedent encodes 
a felicity condition of the speech act performed by [the speaker in the utterance of] the consequent.”) 
 
 
e. 
If you’re hungry, the fridge is on the landing.  (This requires a chain of inferences, including the inferential 
bridge ‘food is usually kept in a fridge’.) 
 
 
f. 
And if you’re keen to keep the calories down, there’s Golden Crown Light too—[just as tasty, but lower in 
fat content].  (COB-W) 
                                              
1 
Note that we use ‘rhetorical conditional’ in a totally different sense from Quirk et al. (1985: 1094). They use “rhetorical” in the 
sense that we use it in ‘rhetorical question’ and therefore say that “rhetorical conditional clauses give the appearance of expressing 
an open condition, but (like rhetorical questions) they actually make a strong assertion.” They distinguish “two types of rhetorical if-
clauses”, viz. the type If they’re Irish, I’m the Pope, which we treat as a type of indirect inferential (viz. an ad absurdum 
conditional), and He’s ninety if he’s a day, which we treat as a ‘truth-evaluating-P conditional’, i.e. as one of the many types of 
(our) rhetorical conditionals to be discussed in this chapter. (Quirk et al. [1985: 1095-1097] also mention some of these types, under 
the heading of “indirect conditions”.) 
2 
Some of the subtypes of rhetorical conditionals distinguished below are also referred to as special by Haegeman (1984). However, 
since Haegeman distinguishes only two types of conditional, viz. “occurrence-conditionals” and “utterance-conditionals” 
(=“conditions on relevance” (p. 492)), all our rhetorical conditionals are subsumed under utterance-conditionals. It will become 
clear from the discussion below that it is not true that in all rhetorical conditionals “the if-clause provides some motivation for the 
utterance” (p. 487). 
3 
As noted by Sweetser (1996: 327), such conditionals are sometimes called “conditional speech acts”. Dik (1990: 252) speaks of 
“illocutionary conditionals”. See also van der Auwera’s (1986) discussion of the difference between “speech act conditionals” and 
“conditional speech acts”. Some people, including Wierzbicka (1997: 21), speak of “pragmatic conditionals”. 
4 
Some other types of adverbial clauses can also comment on the relevance of uttering the head clause: 
 
(i) 
Since you obviously want to know, the bride wasn’t wearing a white dress. 
 
(ii) 
Just so as you know what to expect, he’s very sleepy, and he might not recognize you.

Because the Q-clause is often factual (even though the P-clause is not), there are many relevance conditionals 
whose Q-clause can stand on its own. Compare: 
(628) 
a. 
If you’re hungry, there’s a pie in the fridge.  (The Q-clause is factual; the P-clause may be closed or open.) 
 
 
b. 
There’s a pie in the fridge. [I’m telling you this in case you’re hungry.] 
However, the Q-clause requires the P-clause if there is some referential link between the two clauses: 
(629) 
a. 
[Look, somethin’ for you or your sergeant, OK?] If he wants to check up about Wednesday, when I went to 
Brum, I went to an abortion clinic there.  (DOC) (The referent of ‘there’ is to be identified via the ‘when’-
clause that is embedded in the P-clause.) 
 
 
b. 
So, if anyone would like to learn how to organize a press conference, this is an ideal opportunity.  [adapted 
from COB-S] (The element in the Q-clause that refers back to the P-clause is to be found in an elided ‘to do 
so’, in which ‘do so’=‘learn how to organize a press conference.’) 
 
 
c. 
If you relish the occasional short tussle with the elements, Mediterranean waters willingly provide the 
means.  (COB-W) 
It follows from the pragmatic function of relevance conditionals that they are never at the same time inferential 
conditionals. (It is a very different thing to say that the truth of Q can be inferred from the truth of P and to say 
that the utterance of Q is relevant in the case that the P-situation actualizes.) By contrast, the P-clause of a 
relevance conditional may sometimes have an actualization-conditioning or purely case-specifying connotation: 
(630) 
a. 
If you are interested, I can tell you more about it next time.  (This sentence not only expresses that it is 
relevant for the speaker to utter the Q-clause, i.e. to make the offer, if the hearer is interested in the subject, 
or to hear more, but also that the hearer’s interest, or assurance of interest, is a condition for the carrying 
out of the offer, i.e. for the telling. This complex interpretation probably follows from the fact that the 
conditional represents an indirect speech act: the conventional interpretation as an offer is relevant to the 
relevance-expressing-P aspect of the interpretation, whereas it is the literal reading which is relevant to the 
actualization-triggering-P aspect.) 
 
 
b. 
If you wish to know more about the artists and craftsmen their addresses are listed in this programme.  
(COB-W) (The conditional here implies something like ‘If you want to know x, do y’, i.e. it is not exclusively 
concerned with relevance but also with the actualization of an action recoverable from the Q-clause.) 
 
 
c. 
If you have graduated there are some useful contact points: CILT (Centre for Information on...  (COB-W) 
(connotation of purely case-specifying conditional) 
 
 
d. 
If you think you have the potential to follow a career in one of the European institutions, I cannot think of a 
more rewarding first step to take.  (COB-W) (id.) 
It is only in relevance conditionals with such a connotation that then can sometimes be found before the Q-
clause.5 Compare: 
(631) 
a. 
If you want to go out and it’s raining, (*then) there is an umbrella in the wardrobe.  (‘Then’ cannot be used 
because the P-clause does not have an actualization-conditioning or purely case-specifying connotation.) 
 
 
b. 
If you are interested, then I can tell you more about it next time.  (actualization-conditioning-P connotation) 
 
 
c. 
If you have graduated, then there are some useful contact points.  (purely case-specifying-P connotation) 
However, as said before, there is never a premise-expressing-P connotation. 
Some relevance-conditionals make use of in case or (formal) lest: 
(632) 
a. 
[We recommend planning your holidays as well in advance as possible.] In case you are really planning 
ahead, we are able to take registrations on certain tours for 1994.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
In case you’re worried we’d like to reassure you that the renowned quality is the same.  (COB-W)

Iatridou (1994: 182) overlooks examples like (882b-c) when she claims that “what is referred to as a ‘relevance’ conditional is 
incompatible with then.” 

 
205
 
 
c. 
[... he has sent us what he calls a domestic newsletter called ‘KOPROS’, which he explains as follows:] 
“Lest those with the vestiges of a classical education should think otherwise, this title is an Acronym for the 
Kent Organisation for Propagating Reasonable and Ordinary Speech.”  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[On November 13, two weeks before Budget day, Sir Patrick is invited to 11 Downing Street, where 
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, will host a reception in his honour.] Lest anybody cry “foul” in the belief 
that the tobacco chairman has an unfair chance to lobby on behalf of the highly taxed industry, this is purely 
a social occasion.  (COB-W) 
What is interesting is that in many examples, substituting if for in case would be odd or unacceptable. Consider: 
(633) 
a. 
In case you missed the recent news, Running has joined forces in the UK with the world’s leading running 
magazine—Runner’s World.  (COB-W) [?if] 
 
 
b. 
[You haven’t even nibbled at the Requiem ... .] The requiem is for you to sing in case I didn’t make it clear.  
(COB-S) [?if] 
 
 
c. 
In case you hadn’t noticed we have been joined, especially in the last ten years, by a large number of rival 
magazines.  (COB-W) [??if] 
 
 
d. 
By the way, in case you are wondering, I am nothing to do with banks at all. [I am a retired schoolmaster 
and I don’t like banks.]  (COB-S) [(?)if] 
 
 
e. 
[“How about MX phoning up about the story that’s been in the papers this morning about Patsy Kensit?”] 
— “Er, in case you missed it, it says she’s in hospital after having an emergency operation to remove her 
appendix.”]  (COB-S) [?if] 
 
 
f. 
In case anyone has forgotten, Cable and Wireless ... also has designs on Germany and has formed a broad 
partnership with Veba.  (COB-W) [??if] 
 
 
g. 
[However, Tony and Paddy cannot ‘come out’ until after the general election.] In case you get the wrong 
idea, their wives approve and get on well when the two leaders socialise.  (COB-W) [*if] 
The absolute unacceptability of if replacing in case in the last example is due to the fact that the P-clause 
receives a preclusive (preventative) interpretation: the speaker wants to prevent the hearer getting the wrong 
idea. Though if-clauses can express a preclusive meaning (see 9.1.2.2), this preclusive meaning is different from 
the one expressed by in case. Compare: 
(634) 
a. 
If it freezes, the skating contest will not be cancelled.  (interpreted as ‘P will cause [-q]’, i.e. ‘P will 
preclude [+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
I wore sunglasses and a hat in case I was recognized.  (interpreted as ‘Q in order to preclude P’) 
In the other examples of (633), in case has a precautionary meaning. In (633a-e) the replacement of the 
precautionary in case-clause by a relevance-expressing if-clause is somewhat strange, but does not lead to real 
unacceptability. In (633f) if is worse because a relevance-expressing if-clause is hardly compatible with the 
meaning of the Q-clause, whereas a precautionary in case-clause is quite natural in this context. 
Needless to say, if cannot be substituted for in case either in the phrase just in case: 
(635) 
Anyone making an inquiry will be wasting their time—just in case you were tempted.  (COB-S) 
Another thing worth noting in connection with relevance conditionals is that they cannot appear in the form of 
pattern 2 or pattern 3—see also Dancygier & Sweetser (1997: 121). In other words, the P-clause of a relevance 
conditional as a rule creates an open, closed or neutral P-world. Still, occasional examples can be found in which 
a pattern 2 P-clause combines with a factual Q-clause: 
(636) 
a. 
There’s a birthing chair if you wanted one.  (COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
[Though I have not eaten there it is meant to offer some of the best food among London clubs. I have never 
needed a club, but] if I did this one seems an excellent bet.  (COB-W) 
In the following example, an imaginary P-clause combines with a factual Q-clause: 
(637) 
[“Oh, I forgot to tell you yesterday. Were you hungry when you were here?” — “No. Why?”] — “If you had 
been hungry, there was plenty of food in the fridge.” 
However, examples like (637) can be analysed as ‘pseudo-Q-conditionals’, i.e. as conditionals that have a covert 
Q-clause and in which the overt Q-clause gives the reason for the actualization of the covert Q-clause situation. 
Thus, (637) is read as something like ‘If you had been hungry, you could have eaten something, as there was 
plenty of food in the fridge.’ 
Another interesting observation is that a relevance-expressing P-clause (=the P-clause of a relevance 
conditional) may be found in postscript position, or even as an independent if-clause following the Q-clause: 

 
206
(638) 
a. 
[I gotta go now—it’s almost dark and] like werewolves, they come out at night, in case you didn’t know.  
(COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
Is this car better than the other one? If I have to make a choice. 
Finally, one of the things that distinguish relevance-conditionals from case-specifying conditionals and other 
utterance conditionals—see sections 10.1.2 through 10.1.6 below—is that they lack the implicature (‘invited 
inference’) that if may be interpreted as iff (‘if and only if’) as long as this interpretation does not run counter to 
the context or to our pragmatic knowledge of the world (=the ‘conditional perfection’ implicature—see section 
12.4.2). Thus, If the weather is fine, we’ll visit the zoo suggests that we will not visit the zoo if the weather is 
bad. There is no similar invited inference that ‘not-P’ induces ‘not-Q’ in relevance conditionals: If you’re thirsty, 
there’s is beer in the cellar does not implicate ‘If you’re not thirsty, there isn’t any beer in the cellar’. 
 
10.1.2. Anchoring-P conditionals 
 
In this type of utterance-conditional, the P-clause is merely used to provide a starting point for the utterance of 
the Q-clause. It is a kind of rhetorical linking device to heighten coherence by anchoring the Q-clause into the 
ongoing discourse. For example: 
(639) 
a. 
[“You another dur’y ol’ man or somethin’?”] — “If I am, I’m a dirty old police inspector,” [replied Morse, 
in what he trusted was a cultured, authoritative tone].  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
If Mrs Rodway was ... impressed by this amalgam of metaphors, she gave no indication of it.  (DOC) 
 
 
c. 
Lewis is not known to have a girlfriend, and if he does he’s not telling.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[“Has Stella Grey’s daughter ever got married?” — “I don’t know.] If she has, I’ve never been informed.”  
(DOC) 
 
 
e. 
If he noticed Brand, he didn’t comment.  (COB-W) 
In these examples, the P-clause is clearly not actualization-conditioning, premise-expressing or utterance-
licensing.6 It could probably be treated as purely case-specifying, but it also serves the rhetorical function of 
anchoring the Q-utterance into the current discourse. That is, the P-clause provides a suitable starting point for 
the illocutionary speech act that is performed in uttering the Q-clause. This is one of the cases in which the P-
clause is clearly the theme (topic) of the conditional. 
Anchoring P-clauses often have the additional effect of anticipating and ruling out pragmatic presuppositions 
or implicatures that might arise from a more straightforward response. For example, in (639a), if Morse just 
answers, (No,) I’m a policeman—which would be a normal response—the implication would be that being a 
policeman rules out being a dirty old man. The if-clause acknowledges the falseness of this implication. 
As we saw in section 4.2.2.6, anchoring-P conditionals are typically neutral-P conditionals. Thus, in (639a), P 
is a neutral supposition because there is no assumption (presupposition) on Morse’s part that he treats the 
supposition as true, untrue, unlikely to be true, or as a real possibility. As regards this, the conditional shows no 
commitment whatever on the part of Morse. More specifically, Morse does not admit that he is, or may be, a 
dirty old man. 
‘Premodified reduced it-clefts’ (see 4.2.4.4) form another type of rhetorical conditional with an anchoring P-
clause. Premodified reduced it-clefts are specificational (see 3.14) sentences like (640), in which the if-clause 
introduces a variable; that variable is given a value in the Q-clause, which is a reduced it-cleft: 
(640) 
If anyone is responsible for this, it’s the Town Council.  (=‘If anyone is responsible for this, it’s the Town 
Council [that is responsible for this].) 
As will be noted in section 11.14.4, the if-clause here typically represents old (pragmatically presupposed) 
information and therefore naturally takes the position of the theme (topic) of the sentence. In other words, the 
use of a premodifying P-clause is a device for heightening textual coherence: it links up with the preceding 
context by resuming something that has already been said or implied (in this example: that someone is or may be 
responsible). As pointed out by Jespersen (1932: 134), the construction as a whole (which we call a premodified 
reduced it-cleft) is a “rhetorical device” to highlight what is said in the head clause, i.e. to focus the value 
expressed after it is. 
                                              
6 
We disagree with Dudman (1991: 227-228), who analyses If the latter was surprised and delighted, he disguised it like a diplomat 
as an “inferential”. 

 
207
The above remarks on premodified reduced it-clefts also apply to sentences like the following, which are 
similar except for the fact that the value-specifying head clause is not a reduced it-cleft: 
(641) 
If anyone should have foreseen it, I should.  (COB-W) 
 
10.1.3. Performative-Q conditionals 
 
In this type of utterance conditional, P expresses either the reason why the speaker utters a performative Q-
statement, or a necessary condition for uttering it. 
(642) 
a. 
If that’s the way you treat me, I {quit / advise you to change your attitude}.  (The closed P-clause gives the 
reason for uttering Q and for performing the Q-situation.) 
 
 
b. 
If, as is clearly the case, we can’t reach an agreement today, I declare this meeting closed.  (id.) 
 
 
c. 
If she takes part in the race, I bet she comes in last.  (Here, the open P-clause expresses a necessary 
condition for the speech act of uttering the Q-clause, but not the reason for uttering it.) 
 
 
d. 
If my niece comes to the party, I {ask / beg / warn} you to stay away from her.  (id.) 
 
10.1.4. Metalinguistic-Q conditionals 
 
In this type of utterance conditional, P expresses a condition for uttering a metalinguistic Q-statement like I 
think, I reply, I argue, I concede, I conclude, I assume, I postulate, it means, etc. (that). (A statement is 
metalinguistic if it forms part of the language we use to speak about language. Producing a metalinguistic 
utterance constitutes a particular kind of speech act.) 
(643) 
a. 
If he has murdered once, I {assume / think / conclude} that he will murder again.  (Premise-expressing-P, 
so this could be called a ‘metalinguistic-Q inferential.’) 
 
 
b. 
If he hasn’t arrived by five, it means that he missed his train.  (id.) 
 
 
c. 
If he ever says that again, I think I will slap his face.  (actualization-triggering-P + metalinguistic-Q 
conditional) 
These sentences represent a hybrid form of conditional, since they are at the same time case-specifying-P 
conditionals (viz. inferentials or actualization conditionals) and utterance conditionals (which are rhetorical 
conditionals, the prototypical instances of which are purely non-case-specifying-P). 
 
10.1.5. Nonassertoric-Q utterance conditionals 
 
Some conditionals with a nonassertoric Q-clause are utterance conditionals, but do not belong to one of the 
previous three subtypes. The P-clause of these conditionals expresses either a condition for the Q-utterance or 
what induces the speaker to utter the Q-clause. The Q-clause expresses either a directive or a nonassertoric 
question: 
(644) 
a. 
[Suggest and advise rather than command and bully.] If you must impose your will, give reasons rather than 
be arbitrary.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[It is most important that a child should be aware of constant, harmonious relationships between his 
parents.] If you must quarrel with your partner, don’t do it before your child; [and make it up before he can 
sense the rift.]  (COB-W) 
(645) 
a. 
If Martha’s business is doing so well, will she be taking on extra staff? 
 
 
b. 
If you’re not too busy, what’s Sue’s phone number?  (Sweetser 1996: 327)7 
It needs stressing that, although the P-clause of (645a) clearly expresses a premise, we should not treat this 
sentence as a normal inferential. The inducive (causal) link between the two clauses is not between the truth of P 
and the truth of a conclusion Q. It is between the truth of P and the utterance of the Q-clause. In (645a) the 
speaker presents the question about John’s clothes as conditional on the truth of the tensed proposition ‘John is 
                                              
7 
Sweetser treats this example on a par with If you need any help, my name is Chris. She considers both sentences as “conditional 
speech acts”, i.e. conditionals in which “the speaker presents the performance of a speech act as taking place in the conditional 
mental space established by the protasis” (p. 327). This analysis is correct if one focuses on the illocutionary speech act status of the 
Q-clause. However, if one focuses on the function of the P-clause, the two conditionals belong to different classes: If you’re not too 
busy, what’s Sue’s phone number? is a ‘nonassertoric-Q utterance conditional’, whereas If you need any help, my name is Chris is a 
clear example of a relevance conditional. 

 
208
well-off’. This P may be a premise, but it is a premise on the basis of which it is logical to ask Q, not a premise 
for the truth of Q, since Q, being nonassertoric, does not have a truth value. By contrast, premise-expressing-P 
conditionals whose Q-clause is an assertoric question do qualify as inferentials. For example: 
(646) 
If YOU aren’t going to do it, who is? 
This can be interpreted two ways: 
 
(a) I hear YOU aren’t going to do it. This induces me to ask the question Who IS going to do it? 
 
(b) You’re the only one who is able or willing to do it. So, if YOU aren’t going to do it, nobody is. 
(646) is a nonassertoric utterance conditional on reading (a) and an inferential conditional on reading (b) (which 
is the ‘rhetorical question’ reading). 
 
10.1.6. Commenting-Q utterance conditionals 
 
In this type of utterance conditional, the P-clause introduces a topic and the Q-clause expresses a comment on 
this topic: 
(647) 
If he hasn’t solved the problem, that doesn’t mean that he’s not intelligent.  (=‘If he hasn’t solved the problem, 
the fact that he hasn’t solved it doesn’t mean that he’s not intelligent.’ The topic introduced by P is ‘the fact that 
he has not solved the problem’, the Q-comment on this topic is ‘[that] does not mean that he is not intelligent’.) 
In this example, the P-clause is closed and the Q-comment contradicts a conclusion which has been, may have 
been, or may be made. (This does not mean that (647) is an inferential, though.) The following are some further 
examples, showing that the P-clause may be of various types: 
(648) 
a. 
(standing in front of the painting) If this is the famous Mona Lisa, it’s not half as good as everybody says.  
(=Seeing the famous Mona Lisa prompts me to comment that it’s not a particularly good painting.) (The 
closed P-clause introduces the topic [the Mona Lisa] and the Q-clause expresses the speaker’s comment on 
this topic.) 
 
 
b. 
If that’s really the way Railtrack play things, that’s a culture that would horrify anyone in the aviation 
industry. [That’s like going back to the stone age.]  (BBC Radio 4, in a discussion of the withholding of 
accident reports) (closed-P) 
 
 
c. 
(referring to the discovery of evidence of life in rock samples from Mars) [“Is this all just a NASA stunt, to 
stimulate public interest in space exploration?”] — “Well, if it were a NASA stunt, it’s been extremely 
successful.”  (BBC World Service) 
 
 
d. 
[“Why on earth would they want a baby like Bella?” There came no answer, but Izzy thought she knew. 
Judi had told her, igniting a bonfire of fears. White flesh. The ultimate status symbol. To be raised in the 
traditional way.] And even if it were for some other reason, it scarcely mattered. [They had sold her baby.]  
(COB-W) (The sentence can be interpreted either as ‘And even if it were for some other reason, it scarcely 
mattered that it was for some other reason’ or as ‘And even if it were for some other reason, it scarcely 
mattered what the reason was’.) 
 
 
e. 
If these refugees have rice to eat, it’s all that they have. 
In all commenting-Q conditionals, the P-clause precedes the Q-clause because the conditional has a topic-
comment (theme-rheme) structure. Because the P-clause is thematic, there is a case for claiming that it is an 
anchoring P-clause (see section 10.1.2 above). However, these examples differ from ordinary anchoring 
conditionals in that they are more concerned with establishing correct reference, i.e. with making sure that the 
comment in Q is only taken to apply if the speaker’s knowledge base about the topic is correct. 
Funk (1985: 368-369) draws attention to (649a), which is similar to (647), but wrongly suggests that it should 
be analysed in the same way as (649a-b): 
(649) 
a. 
If he has not done his work, this does not mean that he has been lazy. 
 
 
b. 
If he attacks me, I’ve got a gun. 
 
 
c. 
If anybody wants to see me, I’ll be in the office. 
In our opinion, (649a) is a commenting-Q conditional (and/or a nonpreclusive-P inferential—see section 
9.2.2.3), whereas (649b) is an example of a pseudo-Q conditional (see sections 3.12 and 7.2.10) with a purely 

 
209
case-specifying P-clause: (649b) is read something like ‘If he attacks me I can defend myself because I’ve got a 
gun’.8 Sentence (649c) is not commenting-Q either but is a relevance conditional. 
 
10.2. Comparing conditionals 
 
10.2.1. Definition 
 
In this type of rhetorical conditional, in which if is the only possible conjunction, the ‘if P, Q’ construction is 
used merely to compare P and Q, i.e. to express some degree of similarity or contrast between the two 
propositions. For example: 
(650) 
a. 
If your sister is clever, so is mine. 
 
 
b. 
If your sister is clever, mine is positively a genius. 
 
 
c. 
If your sister is clever, mine is positively a nitwit. 
 
 
d. 
If your sister is clever, she’s not sufficiently hard-working to reach the top. 
In such examples, the if-clause serves as a starting-point, but not of an inferential reasoning process: Q is not a 
conclusion based on P, hence P is not a condition for Q. The P-clauses are therefore not case-specifying. In most 
of the examples the P-clause is ‘topic-introducing’. ‘Topic’ is meant here as ‘discourse topic’—what is talked 
about in a continuous stretch of discourse—rather than ‘topic / theme of a clause’ (in the Hallidayan sense). That 
is, a topic-introducing P-clause contains some ‘old’ or ‘given’ information which functions as a starting-point to 
which the information in the Q-clause can be attached. As we shall see in some of the examples below—e.g. 
(652a-b)—this sometimes allows a comparing conditional to be used, particularly in literature or scripted speech, 
to create a transition from one (genuine) topic to another by finding, or forcing, some feature common to old and 
new information, and using that feature as a pivot (‘pivot topic’) on which to change direction. This is similar to 
what is often done by a radio presenter who links two actually more or less unconnected items by finding a 
feature that can be considered common to both, for example, retrospectively treating ‘machinery’ as a salient 
feature of an item about farming in order to link it to a subsequent item about computers. In what follows, the 
word ‘topic’ in ‘topic-introducing’ will be used in this sense, viz. ‘a topic which is introduced in P and which 
serves as a discourse-bridge between the topic of the preceding context and the new topic introduced in Q.’ 
However, although, as we have said, most comparing conditionals have a topic-introducing P-clause, not all of 
them do. 
It should be clear that there are strong similarities between topic-introducing P-clauses and anchoring P-
clauses. However, anchoring P-clauses express a neutral theoretical condition, while topic-introducing ones 
express a closed or factual condition. 
 
10.2.2. Subtypes of comparing conditionals 
 
10.2.2.1. Similarity-expressing conditionals 
 
In these conditionals, the speaker expresses the similarity between the two situations (or between participants in 
the situations) and affirms his belief that the Q-proposition is as closed as the P-proposition: 
(651) 
a. 
[This documentary has been about sharks.] However, if sharks are dangerous to man, so are many other 
predators. [Next time we will examine the behaviour of tigers and other dangerous cats.]  (introducing or 
reiterating the topic of animals that are dangerous to man) 
 
 
b. 
If that was an important day for rugby, it was also a red-letter day for China.  (BBC World Service) (The 
conditional links an item on the rugby World Cup final to an item on the 50th anniversary celebrations of 
the People’s Republic of China, by treating ‘an important day’—which is also what is meant by ‘a red-letter 
day’—as a shared topic.) 
 
 
c. 
If you don’t have any questions left, neither do I. [So I hereby declare the meeting closed.] 
 
 
d. 
If the traditional east to west road movie has been given a 90 degree turn here, so has typical American 
sentimentalism.  (COB-W) 
                                              
8 
Surprisingly, Funk (1985: 403) ultimately suggests a similar analysis for (649b), thus wrongly suggesting that (649a) can also be 
analysed in terms of a missing Q. Dancygier (1988b: 118) analyses (649b) as missing-Q concessive, but we do not see how it can be 
concessive unless even if is used or it is couched in a context inviting a concessive interpretation.

e. 
[Morse finished his beer. It had taken that swift drinker an inordinately long time to do so;] and if Morse 
had experienced a premonition earlier, Lewis himself now sensed that his chief was seriously ill.  (DOC) 
 
 
f. 
If the case against him isn’t very strong, neither is that against his wife. 
 
 
g. 
[Most agricultural communities can absorb one disaster. How many can cope with two?] But if the poor will 
suffer, so will the rich.  (COB-W) 
 
10.2.2.2. Contrastive conditionals 
 
These represent a second subtype of comparing conditionals. They express dissimilarity between the two 
situations or between participants in the two situations. As in similarity-expressing conditionals, both situations 
are represented as factual or closed. 
(652) 
a. 
If a few minutes earlier it had been his stomach that was churning over, it was now the turn of Morse’s 
brain.  (DOC) (pivot topic: things churning over) 
 
 
b. 
[Yet Julia felt herself shivering slightly as she unlocked and unbolted the rear door.] And if a few moments 
earlier she may have looked a little sad, a little strained—behold now a metamorphosis!  (DOC) (topic: how 
she looked) 
 
 
c. 
[“But I’m talking too much. I’m wasting your time.” — “No, you aren’t.”] — “Well, if I’m not wasting 
your time, you’re wasting mine. [Goodbye, inspector.]”  (BBC drama) 
 
 
d. 
If John had problems adapting himself to his new environment, his wife (by contrast) had none whatsoever. 
 
 
e. 
If I’ve had a succesful career, I’ve been a complete failure as far as my private life is concerned. 
 
 
f. 
If Brussels is the busiest city in Belgium, Bruges is the most beautiful. 
 
 
g. 
If Real’s keeper had an off-par evening, his opposite number was outstanding.  (BBC World Service) 
Note that the first two examples nicely exemplify what was remarked in section 10.2.1 about the author forcing 
comparisons to provide a pivot topic in the text-topic. In (652a), ‘things churning over’ is a rather artificial topic, 
but it is presented as a pivot topic: the P-clause creates a transition from one topic (viz. Morse’s stomach) to 
another (viz. Morse’s brain) by forcing some feature common to both. In other words, the conditional as a whole 
functions as a discourse-bridge: while the pivot topic is ‘things churning over’, the element in P which relates to 
the old topic (i.e. provides one end of the bridge) is ‘Morse’s stomach’ and the element in Q which relates to the 
new topic (i.e. provides the other end of the bridge) is ‘Morse’s brain’, and this new topic will then be developed 
in a discussion of Morse’s thoughts. 
 
10.2.2.3. Gradation conditionals 
 
‘Gradation(-expressing)’ conditionals form the third subtype of comparing conditionals. They are like similarity-
expressing or contrastive conditionals, but at the same time they express a difference of gradation (similar to the 
comparative or superlative degrees of adjectives). 
(653) 
a. 
If you think Pete’s children are badly behaved, you should see Diana’s twins.  (topic: badly behaved 
children) 
 
 
b. 
If his daughter is beautiful, my daughter is a Venus!  (Akatsuka 1991: 32) (This can also be read as an ad 
absurdum conditional, if the speaker acknowledges that her daughter is far from beautiful and is thus 
deliberately using a counterfactual Q-clause.)9 
 
 
c. 
If Lewis was ninety-five per cent convinced that Costyn was lying, he had been one hundred per cent 
convinced that Ashley Davies ... could never have been responsible for the prising open of Cabinet 52.  
(DOC) 
 
 
d. 
If I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.  (Defoe—cited in Jespersen [1940: 378]) 
 
 
e. 
If he didn’t commit ALL these murders, he certainly committed the last three. 
 
 
f. 
[As she thought back on these things ... ] she found herself halfsmiling—if not with cruelty at least with a 
grim satisfaction.  (DOC) 
Within these examples a further subdivision could be made into ‘boosting-Q’ and ‘downtoning-Q’ 
conditionals:10 in (653a-d), Q is stronger than P (=boosting-Q), whereas in (653e-f), Q is a weakened version of 
                                              
9 
Akatsuka (1991: 32) calls this example a “tipped scale Dracula-conditional” (which in our terms would be a ‘gradation-expressing 
ad absurdum conditional’) and thus apparently fails to see its ambiguity. We think the sentence is a gradation-expressing conditional 
on one reading and an ad absurdum conditional on the other. 
10 In sections 10.3.1 and 10.3.2 we will discuss ‘downtoning-P’ and ‘boosting-P’ conditionals, respectively. At this point, however, we 
are talking about Q-CLAUSES that have a downtoning or boosting connotation. 

 
211
P (witness the fact that the P-clause is negative, and that in both sentences at least can appear in the Q-clause). 
(Of course, it is very difficult to pin down intuitions about the ‘strength’ or ‘weakness’ of a statement. This is 
why we are not going far along this line.) 
Conditionals of the type The more we work, the less / more we earn, which, in section 2.10, we called 
‘comparative conditionals’ (not to be confused with ‘comparing conditionals’), are also gradation conditionals. 
They imply the existence of paired scales and the idea that a change of position of the relevant value on the one 
scale triggers the corresponding or opposite change of position of the relevant value on the other scale. 
 
10.2.2.4. Concessive-P conditionals 
 
These form the fourth subtype of comparing conditionals. Some of these are like contrastive conditionals, but in 
addition have a concessive meaning: 
(654) 
[The new vicarage was a three-bedroomed affair, built in the local stone, but in a style best described as 
anonymous. “It just suits us,” Walter Primp told everyone.] And if Thyrza Primp regretted their two-peas-in-a-
pod grandeur in the old vicarage, she had by then gained an unassailable position in the town, [and her natural 
parsimony reconciled her to her reduced state].  (COB-W) 
A boosting P-clause (i.e. a P-clause which uses an expression that is stronger, or which makes a greater claim, 
than the corresponding expression in the Q-clause—see section 10.3.2 below) may have a concessive 
connotation, but not with respect to its Q-clause: 
(655) 
He was at least eighty, if not ninety [and could still do fifty press-ups].  (The concessive link is between 
the P-clause and the clause that follows within square brackets.) 
However, ‘downtoning’ P-clauses (which weaken an expression in the Q-clause—see section 10.3.1 below) may 
be concessive with respect to their Q-clause: 
(656) 
He’s achieved a lot, if not in national politics, at least in his own borough. 
Concessive if often links two constituents of the same class (e.g. adjectives, adverbs, noun phrases), or 
introduces a ‘postscript’ constituent, i.e. a constituent which is preceded by a pause (comma) and is syntactically 
not fully integrated in the head clause. In those cases it does not serve as a starting-point and therefore does not 
have a topic-introducing function: 
(657) 
a. 
[But she could have done.] Ellie Smith could have done—if only just.  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
That glorious, gliding running stride of his swept Ronaldo into movements and manoeuvres that were 
breathtaking, if brief.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
It was as if Chavez had understood the sentiment of what she was saying, if not the words.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[Child abuse cases bring responses from a succession of social services departments and other state and 
para-state organizations] which, structurally if not individually, may be seen as new forms of patriarchal 
family.  (COB-W) 
In the following sentence, the if-clause also has a concessive meaning, but it differs from the previous examples 
in that shameful is conceded principally regarding laughter rather than regarding helpless. That is why if 
shameful is parenthesized (within commas): the meaning is something like ‘I couldn’t help laughing, though I 
felt shameful doing so’. 
(658) 
[The programme was truly mind-blowing bad taste.] I found myself reduced to helpless, if shameful, laughter.  
(COB-W) 
What distinguishes concessive-P conditionals from contrastive ones is that the former, but not the latter, have a P 
which detracts from Q in some way. In some of the concessive-P examples, the Q-clause expresses the opposite 
of what one would normally expect on hearing the P-clause, or vice versa: 
(659) 
a. 
She had made a full (if guarded) statement to the police.  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
She had made a statement which was full, (even) if (it was) guarded. 
 
 
c. 
She had made a statement which, if (it was) guarded, was (at least) full. 
 
 
d. 
If the statement she had made was guarded, it was full. 
In (659a-b) the P-clause contradicts the expectation called up by Q, viz. the expectation that if a statement is full, 
it is not guarded. In (659c-d) it is Q that would appear to run counter to the expectation called up by P, viz. the 
expectation that if a statement is guarded, it is not full. The sentence If he is not rich, at least he isn’t poor is 

 
212
similar to (659c-d): Q (‘he isn’t poor’) runs counter to the expectation ‘he is poor’ which is called up by P (‘he is 
not rich’). 
Similarly: 
(660) 
a. 
I wouldn’t eat that stuff if you gave me a million dollars. 
 
 
b. 
[If you insult him, he doesn’t react.] If you HIT him, he doesn’t react! 
 
 
c. 
[He loved fighting. But when a knife or gun was drawn, he always took to his heels. For,] if he was a daring 
young man, he never took any unnecessary risks. 
In each of these, the Q-clause denies the expectation that is evoked by the P-clause. There seems to be only a 
slight difference between if and though, but it actually follows from a double distinction: (a) though expresses a 
relation between two factual situations, whereas if can link factual as well as nonfactual clauses, and (b) though 
expresses that the head clause situation is unexpected in the light of the though-clause situation, whereas if does 
not express this but has a text-organizing function only. Distinction (a) explains why though cannot substitute for 
if in concessive conditionals which do not allow a factual reading, for example (660a), which can only be factual 
on a very strange habitual reading, (660b), which can only be factual on a strange ‘sports commentary’ style 
reading, and (660c), which can only be interpreted as closed. Distinction (b) explains why the concessive 
meaning of if is weaker than that of though. For example, in (660c) though would imply that taking no 
unnecessary risks is incompatible with being a daring young man, whereas with if the emphasis is rather on the 
compatibility of the two situations. 
In contrastive conditionals that are not concessive, neither proposition runs counter to an expectation called 
up by the other proposition (e.g. If yesterday it had been John who caused the trouble, today it was Gordon). 
The P-clause can also have a concessive meaning in nonassertoric utterance conditionals: 
(661) 
a. 
If you like the country so much, why do you work in London?  (AJ) 
 
 
b. 
How did you have such odd tutors, if you were doing English?  (SEU) 
The speaker here uses the (typically closed) P-clause to explain why she is asking the Q-question—see also 
Haegeman (1984: 497). The speaker’s motivation for asking the question is that in her opinion [+p] is not 
normally compatible with [+q]. The hearer is asked to explain why in this particular case ‘if [+p], then [+q]’ is 
true in spite of this. 
A concessive interpretation of an if-conditional can be triggered or emphasized by the use of at least, 
nevertheless and/or emphatic do in the Q-clause: 
(662) 
a. 
If he is not rich, at least he isn’t poor.  (more or less equivalent to ‘Though he isn’t rich, he isn’t poor 
either.’) 
 
 
b. 
If the police had expected some hooliganism, they nevertheless weren’t prepared for the massive riots that 
took place after the match.  (Though ‘at least’ and ‘nevertheless’ both trigger a concessive interpretation, 
they are far from equivalent. In this example, it is not possible to use ‘at least’ instead of ‘nevertheless’.) 
 
 
c. 
If he isn’t rich, he does have some savings in the bank. 
Another way of emphasizing the concessive meaning is the addition of even before if—see section 14.2.1: 
(663) 
a. 
Even if he’s poor, he’s happy. 
 
 
b. 
[And Mrs Brooks couldn’t have done it either, could she? She’s got the best motive of any of them, and 
she’d probably have the nerve as well.] But she couldn’t have planned it all, surely, even if somehow she 
had the opportunity <to commit the murder> that night, say, after she got back from Stratford.  (DOC) 
Note that in the last example the P-clause again does not serve as a starting-point and therefore does not have a 
topic-introducing function. 
It should be remarked, however, that even if does not exclusively introduce P-clauses of purely concessive-P 
conditionals (which are non-case-specifying-P) . As we will see in section 14.1.1, even if can also introduce 
nonpreclusive inferential conditionals: 
(664) 
Even if the murderer had a key to the house, he needn’t be one of us.  (=Even [+p] need not preclude the 
conclusion [-q].) 
Note the difference of interpretation if even is dropped: 
(665) 
If the murderer had a key to the house, he needn’t be one of us.  (=[+p] leads to the conclusion [-q], where [-q] 
is ‘The murderer needn’t be one of us.’) 

 
213
A final remark on concessive conditionals is that they “reverse the usual desirability relations found in 
conditionals” (Akatsuka 1997: 347). According to Akatsuka (1997: 345), “natural languages virtually exclude 
Desirable / Undesirable or Undesirable / Desirable combinations” in conditionals. That is, both P and Q normally 
express something which is desirable or something which is not desirable. For example, If you eat my cookies, I 
will whip you has only two possible readings: (a) “I would like you to eat my cookies. If you do, I will whip you, 
which you enjoy”, and (b) “I don’t want you to eat my cookies. If you do, I will whip you, which you don’t like” 
(p. 344). Things are different, however, in concessive if-conditionals: in If he is poor, at least he is honest, P is 
undesirable but Q is desirable. 
 
10.2.3. Reference to the post-present in comparing conditionals 
 
The above four subtypes of comparing conditionals are not case-specifying-P—at least, the prototypical 
examples are not.11 This means that the P-clause does not express a condition for the truth of Q or for the 
actualization of the Q-situation. Rather, the P-clause usually introduces an actual-world topic which serves as a 
starting-point for a reasoning process—albeit not an inferential one—and in doing so creates a theoretical-P 
world which is closed (i.e. consisting of propositions which are treated as true in the actual world).12 Because of 
this, comparing conditionals generally make use of the tense system that is typical of closed-P conditionals. 
Thus, as was pointed out in section 5.4.4, closed P-clauses use the future tense or be going to to refer to the post-
present. (As is well-known, this is impossible in open-P conditionals.) This is due to the fact that even future 
situations may be taken for granted, i.e. that predictions may be so confident that the speaker treats the status of 
the post-present situation as ‘assumed to be factual’: 
(666) 
If (as you tell me) he {is going to / will} pay us a visit tomorrow, there is no point in sending him a letter today. 
We find the same tense use in the P-clauses of comparing conditionals. Hence the difference between the 
following: 
(667) 
a. 
If she won’t have an easy life when she goes to college, at least she will have an interesting job when she’s 
got her degree.  (concessive-P conditional with a closed-P interpretation: ‘If, as I assume, <it is the case 
that> she won’t have...’) 
 
 
b. 
If she doesn’t have an easy life when she goes to college, at least she will have an interesting job when she’s 
got her degree.  (case-specifying-P conditional with an open-P interpretation: ‘She may or may not have an 
easy life at college, but in either case she will have an interesting job afterwards.’) 
We have also seen (in section 5.4.4) that the P-clause of a closed conditional may itself be the Q-clause of an 
open-P, tentative-P or counterfactual-P conditional (the P-clause of which is often ‘implicit’: 
(668) 
a. 
If (as you say) it will help you <if I lend you ten pounds>, I am willing to lend you ten pounds. 
 
 
b. 
If (as you say) you would be able to open my safe <if you had the right instruments>, it is time I bought a 
more sophisticated one. 
 
 
c. 
If (as you say) you would have been able to open my safe <if you had had the right instruments>, it is time I 
bought a more sophisticated one. 
The same possibilities exist in comparing conditionals: 
(669) 
a. 
If (as you say) it will help Bill <if I lend him ten pounds>, it will help John just as much.  (similarity-
expressing) 
                                              
11 It may, however, be a delicate matter distinguishing between a comparing conditional and an inferential one. Consider: 
 
(i) 
a. 
If Pete’s good-looking, John’s an Adonis. 
 
 
b. 
If Pete’s good-looking, John is too. 
 
(ii) 
a. 
If the Notting Hill carnival is good, Rio is brilliant. 
 
 
b. 
If you think the Notting Hill carnival is too crowded, you’d be terrified in the Rio carnival. 
 
While (ia) is only gradation-expressing (perhaps because of the exaggeration in the Q-clause), (ib) is certainly open to an inferential 
reading, though it also expresses similarity. Similarly, (iia) is purely gradation-expressing, but (iib), while still referring to a 
difference of gradation, is likely to be understood as inferential. 
 
   Similarly, the P-clause of (iii) has a concessive connotation, but is otherwise purely case-specifying-P: 
 
(iii)  
I wouldn’t eat that stuff if you gave me a million dollars. 
12 In chapter 4 we introduced the ‘possible-world typology’ in connection with case-specifying-P conditionals, because these 
conditionals illustrate the full plethora of possible-world types. However, it was noted that some types of non-case-specifying-P 
conditionals also belong to one or more of the possible-world types. 

 
214
 
 
b. 
If (as I assume) HE wouldn’t say much if such an occasion arose, SHE would no doubt call us all sorts of 
names.  (contrastive) 
 
 
c. 
[They should have gone to the theatre.] If (as I think) it wouldn’t have done HIM any good <if they had 
gone>, at least it might have been a bit of a distraction for his wife.  (concessive-P) 
 
 
d. 
If (as those who have seen the dress say) Joan would look nice in that dress <=if she wore that dress>, it 
would suit my daughter even better. [She would look gorgeous in it.]  (gradation-expressing) 
In all these examples, if can be paraphrased as ‘if (as I believe / assume) it is the case that’ or ‘given that’, which 
paraphrases are typical of closed conditions. 
 
10.3. Commenting-P conditionals 
 
These form another type of rhetorical conditional. As in the case of comparing conditionals, the P-clause is 
neither purely case-specifying nor utterance-licensing, and expresses neither a condition for the actualization of 
the Q-situation nor the premise of an inferential reasoning process. Instead, the P-clause expresses the speaker’s 
comment on the contents of the Q-clause or on the conditions under which she is uttering the Q-clause. 
 
10.3.1. Downtoning-P conditionals 
 
These are commenting-P conditionals in which the (sometimes elliptic) P-clause weakens the strength of an 
expression in the Q-clause or reduces (casts doubt on) the likelihood or possibility of the actualization of the Q-
situation: 
(670) 
a. 
There will only be some fifty people there, if not less. 
 
 
b. 
[Count to ten!—that’s what Morse had once told him before getting on to any high horse; and then, if 
necessary, count to twenty.] He usually only counted to two or three. If that.  (DOC) 
 
 
c. 
Although the governor’s alleged conduct, if true, may certainly be characterized as boorish and offensive, 
[even a most charitable reading of the record fails to reveal a basis for a claim of criminal sexual assault.]  
(COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[I suppose I might try to get to the meeting,] but with the car in this condition, I’d be very late, if I made it 
at all.  (downtoning tentative P-clause) 
 
 
e. 
Usually I can’t think of titles until afterwards if at all.  (COB-S) 
In many cases, the downtoning P-clause further reduces an already small quantity, number or amount by saying 
that the value of the quantifier on the numerical scale may actually be no more than zero. In that case it cancels 
an implicature attached to the quantifier: 
(671) 
a. 
There will only be two or three people there, if any at all.  (‘Only two or three’ implicates ‘more than zero’; 
the P-clause cancels this implicature.) 
 
 
b. 
Nor was he long (if at all) detained by the tall show-cases displaying their specimens of the birds and 
insects of Australasia.  (DOC) (‘If at all’ cancels the implicature ‘not no time’ evoked by ‘not long’.) 
 
 
c. 
Do not expect to get much, if any, of this money back when you leave.  (COB-W) (‘If any’ cancels the 
implicature ‘not none’ (=‘some’) attached to ‘not much’.) 
 
 
d. 
These weak storms cause little, if any, property damage.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
Ratcheting up penalties each time the community demands a tougher stand achieves little, if anything.  
(COB-W) 
On the other hand, the P-clause may also add a somewhat negative qualification to a positive idea. In that case 
there is a concessive connotation. (This accounts for the fact that in the following example even if somewhat 
cheeky can be substituted for if somewhat cheeky. Conditionals that are purely downtoning or boosting do not 
allow the use of even if.) 
(672) 
Aged eleven, she’d started at his school as a lively, slightly devilmay-care lass, with long dark hair and a sweet if 
somewhat cheeky sort of smile.  (DOC) 
Because the function of the P-clause is to tone down (part of) the content of the Q-clause, it can make use of the 
subjunctive were, which is often used as a somewhat more tentative alternative to was (see section 6.1.2): 
(673) 
Lewis had been instructed to discover <something>, if it were at all possible.  (RTM) 
Notice, finally, that even if-clauses may also be commenting and downtoning: 

 
215
(674) 
The King Bolo lyrics have been known to Eliot scholars and enthusiasts for some years now, even if only from 
hearsay. (TLS) 
In this case the following seems a reasonably suitable paraphrase: 
(675) 
The King Bolo lyrics have been known to Eliot scholars and enthusiasts for some years now, but sometimes they 
have only been known from hearsay. 
The meaning of but in the paraphrase (675) is not so much adversative as downtoning: the commenting P-clause 
weakens (an element of) the interpretation of the Q-clause by denying one of the implications or implicatures 
that could be read from the Q-clause. When used in isolation, the sentence The King Bolo lyrics have been 
known to Eliot scholars and enthusiasts for some years now suggests that Eliot scholars and enthusiasts have had 
first-hand access to the text of the King Bolo Lyrics for some years. In (674), the commenting even if-clause 
implies that for at least some scholars and enthusiasts this has not been the case, and thus has a downtoning 
effect on the interpretation of the Q-clause. (The but-clause in (675) actually has a slightly different downtoning 
effect. While (674) means ‘Q, despite some small downtoning’, (675) means ‘Q, but not quite as fully Q as you 
might have thought from just “Q”‘. However, this just shows how difficult it often is to find a paraphrase that 
receives exactly the same interpretation as the sentence it is supposed to paraphrase.) 
A similar downtoning analysis may be suitable for (676): 
(676) 
Women have always kissed women, even if more cynical males describe the process as being reminiscent of 
prize fighters shaking hands. (Barker 1994: 254) 
In isolation, the sentence Women have always kissed women suggests that women have always shown genuine 
signs of affection for each other, because that is what kissing is generally assumed to be. The addition of even if 
more cynical males describe the process as being reminiscent of prize fighters shaking hands questions this 
reading by suggesting that the kissing is seen by some as only done perfunctorily. 
In the following example, the even if-clause is downtoning because it adds a somewhat negative qualification 
to a positive idea. 
(677) 
She’s one of the best students, even if not the BEST, we’ve ever had.  (‘Not the best’ is a weaker expression than 
‘one of the best’.) 
 
10.3.2. Boosting-P conditionals 
 
These are commenting-P conditionals in which the (usually elliptic) P-clause has a boosting, rather than 
downtoning, effect on one of the constituents of the Q-clause. 
(678) 
a. 
She’s one of the best students, if not THE best, we’ve ever had. (=She’s one of the best students, perhaps 
even the best, we’ve ever had.) (Note, however, that ‘if not the best’ can also be read as ‘though not the 
best’.) 
 
 
b. 
Unfortunately, most people who do smoke again smoke as much if not more than ever, especially at first.  
(COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
The point is proved by the fact that I actually use my <Porsche> 959, and I am told it is the one with the 
highest mileage in the UK, if not in the world.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
After two hours, if not sooner, you will fall into a deep, trancelike, and restorative sleep.  (COB-W) (‘If not 
sooner’ boosts the shortness of the period indicated by ‘two hours’; shortness is seen here as something 
positive.) 
 
 
e. 
So much of what is good in the world is done in God’s name, but so unfortunately is so much that I would 
regard as bad, if not positively evil.  (COB-W) (‘Positively evil’ is a stronger expression than ‘bad’.) 
 
 
f. 
Halifax is cool, if not downright freezing.  (COB-W) (This is a boosting-P conditional on the interpretation 
‘Halifax is cool; you might even call it downright freezing.’) 
In these examples, the if-clause is boosting because it involves an expression which is stronger than the 
corresponding expression in the Q-clause. 
Many, if not most, examples of boosting P-clauses involve if not. However, if not can also introduce other 
types of P-clauses, or may combine a boosting meaning with another rhetorical sense. Compare: 
(679) 
a. 
[Messiah and mentor to most,] he is without a doubt the most influential DJ in Frankfurt, if not Germany.  
(COB-W) (boosting-P) 
 
 
b. 
He is the most influential DJ, if not in Germany, at least in Frankfurt.  (downtoning- P) 

 
216
 
 
c. 
[I hope he’ll come.] If not, we’ll have a problem.  (‘if not’=‘otherwise’, i.e. a pro-form for a negative P-
clause, which, in this case, is actualization-conditioning) 
 
 
d. 
[As she thought back on these things ... ] she found herself halfsmiling—if not with cruelty at least with a 
grim satisfaction.  (DOC) (gradation-expressing-P) 
 
 
e. 
[... that morning from the newsagents in Summertown,] where he was at least a well-known face if not a 
well-known name.  (DOC) (concessive-P) 
In the following example, the P-clause can be given either a boosting interpretation or a concessive one: 
(680) 
[The NLD are very clear in their minds now that they really must start to move ahead in this process. And, if they 
don’t move ahead, I think] there is going to be increasing pressure from within the Party, if not from the 
population, that something should now be seen to be happening, in the process of a transfer of power.  (COB-S) 
If not can be read either as ‘and even’ (=boosting) or as ‘though not’ (=concessive) here. The phrase if not from 
the population is somehow equivalent to ‘[[if not] from the population]’ in the former sense and to ‘[[if] not from 
the population]’ in the latter, though in both cases the nonelliptic variant would be if there isn’t (any pressure) 
from the population. 
 
10.3.3. Evaluating-P conditionals 
 
In this third type of commenting-P conditional, the comment expressed by the P-clause represents a kind of 
evaluation of what is said or presupposed in the Q-clause. We can distinguish three main types of evaluating-P 
conditionals, according to whether the P-clause comment is truth-evaluating, content-evaluating or 
presupposition-evaluating. 
 
10.3.3.1. Truth-evaluating-P conditionals 
 
It is typical of these that the comment expressed in the P-clause concerns the degree to which the content of the 
Q-clause is true. In the following examples it does so by explicitly saying that uttering the Q-clause is speaking 
the truth: 
(681) 
a. 
[I felt at first as if I had walked into a dream.] No, more than that, if I am to confess the whole truth.  (COB-
W) 
 
 
b. 
In the bar, Mrs Hardinge was ...  sipping a Cointreau—and, if truth be told, thinking for just a little while of 
the keen blue eyes of the man who had been sitting opposite her at dinner.  (WTW) 
 
 
c. 
If you wanted the truth, his deal on ‘Sonnet’ was not that great.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
If the truth be told, we all prefer the gentle, balmy days of high cloud and a moderate ripple.  (COB-W) 
Notice the use of the present subjunctive in the stereotyped expression if (the) truth be told. This use may have to 
do with the fact that there is some kind of tentative-P connotation: the expression implies that, for whatever 
reason, the content of the Q-clause might be withheld. Thus, (681b) could be read as ‘she wouldn’t actually 
admit this, but the fact is that...’. The use of if (the) truth be told then indicates the speaker’s (or implied 
author’s) decision not to withhold the Q-information. This explanation is in keeping with the use of the tentative 
form wanted in (681c). 
The following represent a second subtype of truth-evaluating-P conditional. Here, the P-clause weakens the 
contents of the Q-clause (and therefore has a downtoning-P connotation): 
(682) 
a. 
She lived on her own happily enough, she supposed—if anyone could ever live happily again after the death 
of an only child. (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
He’ll no doubt be late, if he turns up at all. 
If you say so (already discussed in section 4.2.2.5) represents a third subtype of truth-evaluating P-clause, 
because it also concerns the degree to which the (covert) Q-proposition is true: although it may be noncommittal, 
it may also be clear from the lexical content of the Q-clause, the intonation and/or the context that if you say so is 
meant to express reservations or disagreement:13 
                                              
13 See also Inoue (1983): “‘If you say so’ implies that the speaker acknowledges what has been said with a sense of indeterminacy, 
e.g. skepticism, hedge, etc., a process which is to function to some specific rhetorical purpose.” According to her, Japanese has a 
“cleft conditional” with a comparable function. 

 
217
(684) 
a. 
[“He wrote something like: ‘I’ve got a truly marvellous demonstration of this proposition which this margin 
is too narrow to contain.’ Isn’t that a wonderful sentence?”] — “If you say so, sir.”  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
[“He’s charming when you get to know him.”] — “If you say so.” 
 
 
c. 
[“You’re wrong, his eyes aren’t blue, they’re green.”] — “If you say so.” 
A fourth subtype of truth-evaluating-P conditional is illustrated by the following: 
(685) 
a. 
[What? Forty?] She’s sixty if she’s a day. 
 
 
b. 
The package weighed ten pounds if it weighed an ounce.  (Quirk et al. 1985: 1095) 
 
 
c. 
The painting must be worth a thousand dollars if it’s worth a cent.  (Quirk et al. 1985: 1095) 
In such examples (in which both clauses typically use an indication of measure, amount, number, etc.), the 
function of the if-clause is to emphasize that there is no doubt whatever that the Q-clause is true. This type has 
much in common with a direct inferential, since it expresses ‘P is patently true, hence Q must be true too.’ 
However, the if-clause does not express a real premise, which (among other things) is clear from the fact that it 
typically follows the Q-clause (whereas premise-expressing P-clauses seldom do). Rather than being the P-
clause of an inferential—which seems to be the analysis proposed by Quirk et al. (1985: 1095)—the if-clause is a 
purely rhetorical device to emphasize the truth of the Q-clause. 
The following illustrate a fifth type of truth-evaluating-P conditional: 
(686) 
a. 
If we’re to believe Mary, Joan’s pregnant. 
 
 
b. 
If his opening matches in this year’s contest are anything to go by, it looks as though he could be on his way 
to another British Open Championship title.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[“Would you believe it! John’s finally engaged!”] — “If I know him, that won’t last long.” 
 
 
d. 
He was married to a Scotswoman, if I remember correctly. 
 
 
e. 
[She wrote down five digits on a small yellow pad beside the phone, and said “Bye”]—as did a male voice 
at the other end of the line (if Morse had heard aright).  (DOC) 
 
 
f. 
[But there were starlings among the sparrows ... ] and also, unless my eyes and ears were failing me, a good 
many tree-sparrows.  (LOB) 
 
 
g. 
And those, if I’m not mistaken, are the requirements for life as a Great British institution.  (COB-W) 
 
 
h. 
If I understand it correctly, Jack Straw’s plans to exhort the parents of children who persistently play truant 
might well lead ... to the creation of a new order of criminal.  (COB-W) 
 
 
i. 
Unless I’m going mad, I swear I heard this song many years ago not necessarily performed by Suede.  
(COB-S) 
 
 
j. 
The murderer has apparently been arrested, even if the news hasn’t been confirmed yet by the authorities. 
In examples like these, the P-clause has an ‘evidential’ meaning (see section 9.2.1): it refers to the evidence (in 
the sense of authority or proof, not premise) on which the Q-statement is based, and in doing so represents the 
truth of Q as relative to the degree of dependability of the authority (source) or proof in question. 
An evidential P-clause may be added to a premise-expressing one. In that case the two if-clauses cannot be 
coordinated (because they are of a different type),14 but the two P-propositions can be conjoined in a single if-
clause: 
(687) 
a. 
If my information is correct, if he was an army officer, he was cashiered.  (=If my information is correct, 
then [if P, Q].) 
 
 
b. 
*If my information is correct and if he was an army officer, he was cashiered. 
 
 
c. 
If my information is correct and he was an army officer, he was cashiered. 
Now that different subtypes of truth-evaluating-P conditionals have been identified, it is worth pointing out that 
they may sometimes be used as little more than ‘hedges’, i.e. devices toning down the speaker’s responsibility 
with respect to the assertion made in the Q-clause. (See also section 10.3.7 below.) The following is a clear 
example: 
(688) 
“And you are convinced—if I understand your article—that you would not have gotten the job at Midwestern 
University had it not been for the affirmative action search.” — “Yes.”  (COB-S) 
It is also important to see that truth-evaluating-P conditionals should be carefully distinguished from relevance 
conditionals (see section 10.1.1 above), although they might seem to have much in common. Compare: 
                                              
14 As is well-known, constituents of the same kind can as a rule be coordinated: 
 
(i) 
If John isn’t mistaken and if I may believe Mary, Peter is engaged.  (context: I have received the news from Mary, who heard 
it from John. Both P-clauses have an evidential meaning.) 

 
218
(689) 
a. 
If I may believe Mary, Peter is engaged.  (truth-evaluating P-clause with evidential meaning) 
 
 
b. 
If you want to know, Peter is engaged.  (relevance conditional) 
As noted by Wakker (1996: 184), there are at least two tests to distinguish between these. Firstly, a truth-
evaluating P-clause and a relevance-expressing P-clause can be collocated, but not coordinated: 
(690) 
If you want to know, (*and) if I may believe Mary, Peter is engaged. 
Secondly, there is the difference in grammaticality between the following: 
(691) 
a. 
If I may believe Mary, Peter is engaged, but if I may believe John, he is not.  (truth-evaluating-P) 
 
 
b. 
*If you want to know, Peter is engaged, but if John wants to know, he’s not.  (relevance-P) 
 
 
c. 
*If you are hungry, there is a pie in the fridge, but if John is hungry, there is no pie in the fridge.  
(relevance-P) 
The rule is that truth-evaluating-P conditionals, but not relevance-expressing P-conditionals, can be coordinated 
with but if the two P-clauses are different and the two Q-clauses have the opposite polarity (positive vs negative). 
Self-evidently, the rule applies only if the speaker abides by the Gricean Maxim of Quality by telling the truth. 
Sentence (691c) is quite suitable if the speaker begrudges John eating the pie. In that case, however, the second 
Q is a lie. 
To this test we can add the observation that one way in which the two P-clauses may be different is that they 
differ in their polarity: 
(692) 
a. 
If I can believe Mary, Peter is engaged, but if I cannot believe her, Peter may not be engaged.  (truth-
evaluating-P) 
 
 
b. 
*If you want to know, Peter is engaged, but if you don’t want to know, he may not be.  (relevance-
expressing-P) 
 
 
c. 
*If you are hungry, there is a pie in the fridge, but if you aren’t hungry, there may not be a pie in the fridge.  
(relevance-expressing-P) 
 
10.3.3.2. Content-evaluating-P conditionals 
 
Next to truth-evaluating-P conditionals, there is a second class of evaluating commenting-P conditionals, which 
we will refer to as ‘content-evaluating-P conditionals’. In these conditionals the P-clause expresses the speaker’s 
comment on the contents of the Q-clause. 
(693) 
a. 
[You know, that knife’s somewhere, isn’t it? The knife that someone stuck into McClure. The knife that 
Brooks stuck into McClure. That’s the infuriating thing for me.] Knowing that the bloody thing’s 
somewhere, even if it’s at the bottom of the canal.  (DOC) (The Q-clause says that the knife must be 
somewhere. The ‘even if’-clause adds to this the comment that ‘at the bottom of the canal’ is the least likely, 
or the least accessible, place for the knife to be, but still counts as falling within the reference of 
‘somewhere’.) 
 
 
b. 
With young and developing choreographers, the Royal Ballet’s artistic directorship should (if I may apply 
Walter Bagehot’s three functions of constitutional monarchy) advise, encourage and warn.  (COB-W) 
In the following examples the P-clause expresses the speaker’s comment that something mentioned in the 
preceding context (as in [694a-b]) or in a clause that is embedded in the P-clause (as in [694c]) is ‘more than 
enough’, so that what is expressed in Q is excessive or even ‘the straw that breaks the camel’s back’. 
(694) 
a. 
And if that’s not enough, there are two separate sets <of instructions> being issued by two different 
departments. (COB-W) (This is roughly equivalent to ‘There are two separate sets <of instructions> being 
issued by two different departments, which really takes us into the realms of the excessive, given the rest 
[which you know].’) 
 
 
b. 
[I am nursing another stomach ulcer;] and if that isn’t enough I’m on the verge of diabetes.  (DOC) (similar) 
 
 
c. 
If it isn’t enough that I’m nursing a stomach ulcer, I’m on the verge of diabetes. 
In content-evaluating-P examples like these the speaker voices her personal opinion that the excessive situation 
is unreasonable or too much to bear. On the other hand, the excessive situation can also be seen as something 
positive. (A comparison is in order with superlatives, which may express not only negative but also positive 
ideas.) 
(695) 
If that were not enough Village Youth are to launch a bi-weekly summer season club at the Escape Club, Parade, 
Brighton Central.  (COB-W)

Another subtype of P-clause evaluating the contents of the Q-clause is that in which the P-comment is an 
appended question which is added to see whether the hearer has understood the content of the Q-clause or of one 
of its constituents correctly. 
(696) 
a. 
But are there things here that are just plain valuable, if you know what I mean?  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
[They only live in a small semi-detached house, but] they’ve got a lot of nice things, if you know what I 
mean.  (The P-clause is a kind of warning to the hearer that he should understand ‘nice’ correctly: in this 
case it does not have its weaker sense ‘pleasant’ but the more specific meaning ‘of good taste and 
quality’—see also Haegeman [1984: 496].) 
 
 
c. 
Doubt he’d meet any local girl locally, if you see what I mean.  (DOC) (=if you follow my [unspoken] 
reasoning) 
 
 
d. 
[I don’t think you’ll find that kind of book there.] They’re not specialist enough, if you know what I mean.  
(The speaker seems to be acknowledging that her judgement is based on vague cultural knowledge about 
what is found in which sorts of shops, and that she cannot be precise about what she means by a ‘specialist’ 
shop, although she thinks the hearer probably has a similar definition to her own.) 
If the P-clause is used to check whether the hearer has understood the content of a particular word correctly, it 
also has a kind of metalinguistic comment function (see section 10.3.4 below): 
(697) 
a. 
“They became the sort of the, you know, Piggies of the form, if you remember Lord of the Flies, [you know, 
they were the...” — “Yes, yes.” — “ones that people picked”].  (SEU) (The purpose of the P-clause is to 
check whether the hearer understands what the speaker means by ‘Piggies’.) 
 
 
b. 
[Well, each scout ... looked after one staircase, and... one staircase only—with that area guarded as jealously 
as any blackbird’s territory in a garden,] and considered almost as a sort of mediaeval fiefdom (‘If you 
know what I mean?’).  (DOC) (=If you know what ‘mediaeval fiefdom’ means.) 
 
10.3.3.3. Presupposition-evaluating-P conditionals 
 
Next to truth-evaluating-P conditionals and content-evaluating-P conditionals, this is a third subtype of 
evaluating-P conditionals (which constitute a particular kind of commenting-P conditionals). It is typical of this 
subtype that the comment expressed in the P-clause does not concern the semantic content of Q as a whole, but 
only the justifiedness of a pragmatic presupposition of the Q-proposition: the P-clause questions, cancels, or 
otherwise comments on a presupposition conveyed by the Q-proposition. For example: 
(698) 
a. 
[Well, as I was saying, what if the knife was stolen on the Wednesday afternoon to give everybody the 
impression that] the murder—if there is a murder—was committed later that Wednesday afternoon?  (DOC) 
(The P-clause cancels the pragmatic presupposition of existence attached to the definite NP ‘the murder’.) 
 
 
b. 
[“So when this coin was last heard of, it was in the possession of Mrs Pantelaras?”] — “If it’s the same 
coin,” [Henry said].  (COB-W) (The first speaker’s utterance obviously presupposes that it is the same 
coin.) 
 
 
c. 
[“I wonder which of these two paintings Gregory made first.”] — “If he did paint them both.”  (The P-
clause is a comment on the justifiedness of the presupposition ‘he made both paintings’ inherent in ‘which 
of these two paintings Gregory made first’.) 
Presupposition-evaluating-P conditionals can be further subclassified on the basis of their connotation. In the 
above examples, there is a downtoning connotation: the P-clause rejects, or casts doubt on, the truth of the 
presupposition, and may therefore be referred to as ‘presupposition-questioning’ or ‘presupposition-cancelling’. 
The following are similar examples: 
(699) 
a. 
[“...they should have known what was going on there, and should have done something about it.”] — “If 
anything was going on, sir.”  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
In retrospect, the linkage (if there were one) appeared so very obvious.  (DOC) (The P-clause cancels the 
presupposition of existence attached to the definite NP ‘the linkage’.) 
 
 
c. 
[...and Jane remains a spectral mystery; it is never clear] what she wants or expects from life, if anything at 
all.  (COB-W) (The P-clause cancels the presupposition of existence attached to the definite NP ‘what she 
wants or expects from life’.) 
 
 
d. 
[“Well, for a start, I wouldn’t mind knowing which of those newspapers McClure read first.”] — “If either.”  
(DOC) (The P-clause is a comment casting doubt on the justifiedness of the presupposition ‘he read both 
papers’ inherent in ‘which of those newspapers McClure read first’.) 
 
 
e. 
[“She tells herself things so many times—tells other people things so many times—that she thinks they’re 
true. And for her they are true.” — “But not for us.” — “Not for us, no.” — “Not even the time she was in 

 
220
the bath?”] — “If she was in the bath.”  (DOC) (The presupposition of existence attached to the definite NP 
‘the time she was in the bath’ entails the presupposition that she was in the bath; the P-clause cancels that.) 
 
 
f. 
[“Does anybody know who he is?” — “Yeah, I know him.” — “How do you spell him?” — “P-I-E-double 
L.” — “Thank you.” — “I, ... ] if it’s the same man, I haven’t yet read his application.”  (SEU) (Without the 
P-clause, ‘I haven’t yet read his application’ would presuppose that the person referred to by ‘his’ is 
identified. The P-clause expresses mild doubt about this.) 
 
 
g. 
[To what then does the here-and-now attitude specifically apply?] In which respect is it valid, if at all?  
(COB-W) 
By contrast, in the following examples the presupposition-evaluating P-clause has a kind of boosting effect: 
(700) 
a. 
He was a great politician if there ever was one.  (The boosting effect is achieved by the ostensible allowance 
for the nonexistence of any great politician, ever: ‘in any world in which you can speak of a great 
politician, he was one, and the only grounds on which I would accept that he wasn’t a great politician are 
the grounds that no one was ever a great politician.’) 
 
 
b. 
[Scottish Nationalist MEPs have joined the French Energie Radicale members to form the European Radical 
Alliance —] a marriage of convenience if ever there was one!  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
If anyone, perhaps, shouldn’t she tell him?  (DOC)  (The implication is that he may be the most suitable 
person to tell, because [perhaps] if she tells anyone at all, then he should be top of the list.) 
 
 
d. 
Use chemicals sparingly, if at all.  (COB-W) (Using chemicals sparingly presupposes the use of chemicals; 
the P-clause cancels this presupposition. In doing so it is boosting rather than downtoning, because ‘not at 
all’ would be less than ‘sparingly’, and the message is to use as little as possible.) 
 
 
e. 
[These guides also tell you whether or not you need to book:] As a general rule, you only need to reserve a 
place the day before you go, if at all.  (COB-W) (A requirement to book is a negative thing—you might 
forget, you need to plan ahead, you cannot do things at the last moment, etc.—but if the requirement is only 
for the day before, it is not so negative, and an absence of a requirement to book would be decidedly 
positive, i.e. boosting.) 
A presupposition-evaluating P-clause may also be of the anchoring-P (see section 10.1.2) variety. An anchoring-
P conditional structure can be a way of organizing information in order to allow the speaker to talk of an ‘if-it-
exists situation’. For example, consider the following sentences, which figured among the illustrations of 
anchoring-P conditionals in section 10.1.2: 
(701) 
a. 
[Lewis is not known to have a girlfriend, and] if he does he’s not telling.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[“Has Stella Grey’s daughter ever got married?” — “I don’t know.] If she has, I’ve never been informed.”  
(DOC) 
 
 
c. 
If he noticed Brand, he didn’t comment.  (COB-W) 
Conditionals like (701a-c) offer the possibility of a special organization of information when the speaker is faced 
with a wish to say something about some situation or entity that does not necessarily exist. Thus, in (701a), what 
Lewis is not telling about is an if-she-exists girlfriend. What the speaker has not been told about in (701b) is any 
may-have-happened marriage. In (701c), a simple He didn’t comment on (having noticed) Brand would invite 
the interpretation that ‘he’ noticed Brand: pragmatically, it is pointless to mention someone’s not having done 
something (or having failed to do something) if you do not presuppose that they could have done it. This 
pragmatic presupposition (that ‘he’ could have commented on Brand, and thus that he had noticed Brand) is 
dealt with (i.e. cancelled) in advance by the if-clause, so that the speaker can then go on to say He didn’t 
comment without the unwanted presupposition. In sum, the P-clauses of conditionals like (701a-c) are not only 
‘anchoring’ but also ‘presupposition-evaluating’. 
The following is similar, except that the presupposition concerns an if-it-is entity rather than an if-it-is 
situation: 
(702) 
If she’s married, she left her husband at home. 
If she’s married clearly spells out the presupposition of existence attached to the definite noun phrase her 
husband in the Q-clause. 
In examples like the following, the P-clauses also have the rhetorical effect of cancelling a presupposition or 
speaking about if-they-exist entities or situations: 
(703) 
a. 
If there’s someone hidden in that cupboard, they’re keeping very quiet. 
 
 
b. 
If there are rabbits in the garden, they are causing no damage. 

 
221
The P-clauses in these examples unsettle the presupposition of existence attached to the definite subject noun 
phrases of the Q-clauses. That is, sentences like (703a-b) can be used in two ways that enable the speaker to 
avoid subscribing to the existential presupposition. Firstly, they can be used to cast doubt on someone else’s 
assertion that the P-situation is the case—in that case (703b) is meant to be read as ‘I don’t believe it is possible 
that there are rabbits in the garden that cause no damage, therefore I don’t believe your claim that there are 
rabbits in the garden’ (compare with If there are rabbits in the garden, the lettuces are remarkably healthy). 
Secondly, (703a-b) can be used to talk about an if-it-exists entity or situation—in that case (703b) is meant to be 
read as ‘You say that you’ve seen rabbits in the garden and I neither declare my belief nor my disbelief in your 
claim, but simply say that the if-they-exist rabbits are causing no damage (so we needn’t try to get rid of them 
[which is what I assume you thought we should do]).’ 
Dancygier & Mioduszewska (1984) discuss an example similar to (703a): If Susie is listening at the door, she 
is breathing quietly. They point out that such a conditional is special in that P is conditioned by Q: “For the 
speaker to be able to accept p, i.e. Susie’s listening at the door, as true it must also be true that q, i.e. that she is 
breathing quietly. In other words, q is a sort of speaker-relative truthfulness condition of p.” Dancygier (1998) 
rephrases this analysis as follows: in If Susie is listening at the door, she is breathing very quietly, “the apodosis 
offers an account of how the [protasis] can still be interpreted as true in absence of some expected result or 
evidence” (p. 167). 
 
10.3.4. Metalinguistic-P conditionals 
 
In this type of commenting-P rhetorical conditional, the P-clause comments on the form of the Q-clause, on the 
choice of words in it or on the pronunciation of a word: 
(704) 
a. 
If I may be brief, the basic problems are: lack of adequate drainage, rising damp and subsidence. 
 
 
b. 
He is a true yuppie, if that word is still being used. 
 
 
c. 
If I could bring the bible in here, the principle seems to be ‘an eye for an eye’. 
 
 
d. 
The CSA ... should, if we may borrow an over-used phrase from a different context, go back to basics, [back 
to doing the job it was set up to do].  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
She values her “privesi”, if that’s the correct way of pronouncing the word. 
 
 
f. 
[If we start off in a position where we—we just find that our best satisfaction—where]—where our 
highest—er—utility if you like [or what were you going to say?]  (COB-S) 
 
 
g. 
[Or are they to be compelled to resign if, at that same distant point in time, a referendum is called with a 
particular answer] enjoying (if that be the word) a government recommendation from which they dissent?  
(COB-W)  (The speaker’s comment draws attention to the interpretation of the word ‘enjoy’, which 
normally refers to positive attributes, as in ‘The house enjoys a fine view’ or ‘The firm enjoys royal 
patronage’, but which is used here to refer to something [viz. having the government’s recommendation] 
which is not seen as particularly positive.) 
 
 
h. 
[...establishments dating from Victorian times that were usually the home]—if that is the right word—[for 
the mentally handicapped adult].  (SEU) (The speaker’s comment draws attention to the interpretation of 
the word ‘home’, which is to be taken here as euphemistic rather than having its literal meaning.) 
 
 
i. 
[I’m sorry, but I just can’t eat anything. I’m all]—I’m all full up, Mrs Stevens, if you know what I mean.  
(DOC) (Here it is not evident whether the speaker, with ‘if you know what I mean’, is commenting on the 
metaphorical use of the phrase ‘all full up’ to refer to emotional ‘fullness’, or is checking the addressee’s 
understanding of the actual experience that she is describing, or is doing both at the same time. So the P-
clause could be analysed as a metalinguistic comment or as a content-evaluating comment or as both.) 
 
 
j. 
[Erm, there are lots of other words I might comment on.] One of my favourite, er, sort of if I may call it that 
‘loony’ definitions is, is the one for ‘sonnet’. [Er, which is a form in which amongst other things which are 
perfectly acceptable “some lines rhyme with other lines”].  (COB-S) 
 
 
k. 
The story, if so it may be termed, is weak and loose.  (SEU) 
 
 
l. 
[“Are you saying that he’s cracking up?”] — “If that’s how you want to put it, I’m afraid so.”  (COB-W) 
 
 
m. 
[And the more I hear Margaret speak] the more you’re impressed by her absolute, erm, wisdom if I may say 
that.  (COB-S) 
 
 
n. 
Mr Milner’s animus towards Mr Stevens, if indeed it may be called that, was a recent development, brought 
on by their conflict over Miss Radovich.  (COB-W) (There is a downtoning connotation here: the 
implication is that calling the negative feelings of Mr Milner towards Mr Stevens ‘animus’ may be too 
strong.) 
Metalinguistic-P conditionals like these should not be confused with ‘metalinguistic-Q conditionals’ (discussed 
in section 10.1.4 above) (e.g. If he has murdered once, I {assume / think / conclude} he will murder again). They 

 
222
should also be distinguished from Sweetser’s (1990) and Dancygier’s (1992) “metalinguistic conditionals” in 
which the P-clause does not express a comment but a sufficient condition. Dancygier & Sweetser (1997) give the 
following examples (and comment): 
(705) 
a. 
OK, if we’re gonna be picky, (?then) I’ll just put another trout on the grill.  (You previously criticized my 
incorrect use of the word ‘salmon’ [the folk and Linnean uses of ‘trout’ and ‘salmon’ do not coincide]; that 
picky behavior is the sufficient condition for the use of the ‘correct’ word ‘trout’.) (p. 125) 
 
 
b. 
If we were in Louisiana, then you’d be eating ‘green trout’.  (That is, the fish that you are eating is called 
‘green trout’ in Louisiana.) (p. 129) 
 
 
c. 
If we were speaking Spanish, then he’d be your uncle.  (That is, the speaker thinks that the Spanish word for 
‘uncle’, tio, is also used to refer to this person’s relationship to the hearer, perhaps father’s cousin.) (pp. 
129-130) 
In our opinion, the P-clauses here do not express a metalinguistic comment on the choice of the word trout or 
uncle but specify the condition under which the relevant word is used. If this is correct, these examples belong to 
the type dealt with in the next section. 
 
10.3.5. Speech condition-defining-P conditionals 
 
In this fifth type of commenting-P rhetorical conditional, the P-clause defines the conditions under which the 
speaker utters the Q-proposition: 
(706) 
a. 
“If I may speak boldly, Your Grace,” Jill went on. “You need that alliance, and badly.”  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
“If you won’t take it the wrong way, I’d be very happy if this were the only time I ever see you 
professionally.”  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[Well, hard luck!] Yet, if she were honest with herself, she was glad it was all over.  (DOC) 
 
 
d. 
If I may speak for myself, I don’t think it’s a good idea. 
 
 
e. 
He was nuts, if you ask me.  (COB-W) 
In such examples, the function of the P-clause is similar to that of adverbials used as “style disjuncts” (Quirk et 
al. 1985: 615) defining the conditions under which the speaker is speaking, as in the following examples: 
(707) 
a. 
{Honestly / to be honest}, I was glad it was all over. 
 
 
b. 
Seriously, do you intend to move to Spain?  (Declerck 1991b: 232) 
 
 
c. 
Frankly, I don’t give a damn about her. 
 
 
d. 
Personally, I don’t think the play will be a success. 
Speech-condition-defining P-clauses should be distinguished from relevance-expressing P-clauses like the 
following, which explain what induces the speaker to utter the Q-clause: 
(708) 
a. 
[Where had she been then?] Well, if they must know, she’d been in Birmingham for most of that day. ... And 
if they wanted to know whether she’d woken up with a bad head, the answer was “yes”—a bloody dreadful 
head.  (DOC) (FIS) 
 
 
b. 
[“Hope you had a good holiday, sir,” remarked Lewis. “No, I didn’t.] If you really want to know it was a 
bloody awful holiday.”  (DOC) 
 
 
c. 
I can afford a holiday in Greece, in case you’re wondering. 
Within the class of speech-condition-defining-P conditionals several subtypes can be distinguished, such as the 
‘turn-taking-P’ and ‘turn-holding-P’ conditionals, in which the P-clause serves as a device for the speaker to take 
her turn in the conversation, or to prolong it. 
(709) 
a. 
If I may say something too, ...  (turn-taking-P) 
 
 
b. 
If I may add something, ...  (either turn-taking-P or turn-holding-P) 
 
 
c. 
If I could just continue for a moment longer, ...  (turn-holding-P) 
 
 
d. 
[There is the birth of healing and that may be a silly thing to say but I think], if I may be allowed to develop 
the theme, I think that there is a ...  feeling of healing and time passing in nineteen-ninety-six that isn’t...  
(COB-S) (turn-holding-P) 
 
 
e. 
[“Does it have a battery?” — “No, it is a passive device. You can read them by having a simple reader like 
this one here with a ring on the top...”] — “If I may interrupt, it looks rather like the things that you have at 
airports to see if you are carrying anything you shouldn’t.  (COB-W) (turn-taking-P) 
 
 
f. 
If you will listen to me {for a minute now / for one more minute}, I will tell you what her secret is. 
 
 
g. 
[I maybe it’s a controversial subject but] I’d actually like to talk about the legalization of cannabis if I may.  
(COB-S) 

 
223
Such P-clauses come down to the speaker making a request. However, in some examples the ‘request’ is just a 
gesture to politeness, i.e. a hedge (see section 10.3.7 below); the speaker is in fact not waiting for a response to 
it. 
 
10.3.6. Reminding-P conditionals 
 
In this sixth type of commenting-P rhetorical conditionals, the P-clause serves as a reminder: 
(710) 
a. 
If I may remind you, you’ve got an appointment in half an hour. 
 
 
b. 
“They thought there was something structurally wrong with it, the rear wall, if you remember,” — [“which 
you had taken down?” — “Yeah”].  (SEU) 
 
 
c. 
If you think back to the winter, we haven’t had the snow that we normally get, we haven’t had very much 
rain at all.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
If you remember, though, it was President Bubba in the initial hours after the bombing, who urged everyone 
not to jump to any conclusions about who did it.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
But one of the things I was asked to do if you recall was to see to think what we could do if we had more 
staff in this department.  (COB-S) 
In some of these examples, the P-clauses could also be analysed as politeness hedges—see the next section. 
 
10.3.7. Hedging-P conditionals 
 
It has already been noted that some truth-evaluating-P conditionals may be used as hedges toning down the 
speaker’s responsibility with respect to the assertion made in the Q-clause: 
(711) 
{If I am not / unless I am} mistaken, Paris is the capital of France. 
In this section we will concentrate on P-clause hedges that render the assertion made in the Q-clause more 
tentative or diplomatic, i.e. which soften its unpleasantness, abruptness, etc. or render it more polite. In many 
cases they are the weakened version of a P-clause making a request (asking for permission): 
(712) 
a. 
Helga. What an unusual name if I may say so.  (COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
If it’s not rude to ask, what got you interested in linguistics?  (Dancygier & Sweetser 1997: 128) (Dancygier 
& Sweetser put this conditional in their—very big—basket of “speech-act conditionals”.) 
 
 
c. 
You’re acting a little strange, if you don’t mind my saying.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
If it’s OK with you, sir, I’d like to spend some time down at St Aldate’s this morning.  (DOC) 
 
 
e. 
[What about your aim to establish a salon for intellectuals? First of all,] I’d like to say if I may, most people 
don’t want to think.  (COB-W) 
 
 
f. 
But I draw your attention if I may to the one that I’ve spoke—ones that I’ve spoken of.  (COB-S) 
 
 
g. 
If I may be {personal / so bold}, you look wonderful tonight. 
In the following example, if you please is only ostensibly a hedge: it does little in the way of genuine politeness 
or softening of a message. In fact, if you please is very often used as a ‘pseudo-hedge’. (This is clear from the 
speaker’s comment on the quoted speaker’s ostensible hedge in the example.) 
(713) 
...and then he says, erm, he’ll tell me to tidy up the shed if you please [and, erm, sort of that’s an instruction and 
give me an amount of time to do that and if I don’t do it in that amount of time he can serve a notice on me and 
then if I don’t do it by that amount of time then he can take me to court.]  (COB-S) 
If and unless are often the only possible conjunctions to introduce a hedging P-clause. Still, we can find hedges 
like the following: 
(714) 
{Provided / as long as / so long as} it’s OK with you, Smith will follow up the leads we received this morning, 
and I’ll go and interview Mr Hall. 
A final remark on hedging P-clauses is that some may be hedges as well as belong to another type of rhetorical 
conditional. Thus, in the following example the P-clause is a mixture of metalinguistic comment and politeness 
hedge: 
(715) 
[No one’s indifferent to money. But you’re lucky—you don’t know how lucky you are,] Alistair 
having a saleable talent, a mental kink, if you don’t mind my putting it like that, [which you enjoy 
using and which earns you a steady and quite decent income.]  (COB-W) 
 

 
224
10.4. Pseudo-implicative conditionals 
 
This sixth type of rhetorical conditional is illustrated by the following: 
(716) 
If you spit on the floor in your own house, you may do it here.  (notice dating from World War I, still hanging in 
‘Talbot House’ at Poperinge, Flanders) 
Theoretically, this could be read as a regular (direct) inferential. In that case any addressee who was actually 
used to spitting on the floor at home would be entitled to do so in Talbot House too, because he could infer from 
the truth of ‘I spit on the floor in my own house’ the truth of ‘I am allowed to spit on the floor here’. However, it 
is clear that (716) should not be read as an invitation to spit on the floor but rather as an invitation not to do so. 
In other words (716) is a clear example of irony: the speaker conveys the message ‘Please don’t spit on the floor 
here’ by pretending to set out the conditions under which the Q-proposition ‘you may spit on the floor here’ is 
true. In fact, however, the speaker obviously assumes (or pretends to assume) that P (‘you spit on the floor in 
your own house’) will not be true for any of the notice’s addressees, and that the latter will know this. So the 
addressee is assumed to recognize that the conditional restricts the grounds for the valid conclusion of Q in such 
a way as to make it impossible to infer that Q is true. (This assumes an iff reading of if, which, as we will see in 
12.4.2, is the default reading because of the ‘necessity implicature’.) The deliberate use of a conditional that 
restricts the possibility that spitting will be permissible to nil is, of course, a clear message that spitting is not 
permissible. In other words, (716) should not be read as an inferential (or other kind of case-specifying) 
conditional but as a pseudo-implicative conditional whose communicative function is that of a simple directive: 
‘Please do not spit on the floor here’. 
Another type of conditional which is a pseudo-implicative because it is used for rhetorical purposes only is 
illustrated by the following example from Inoue (1983): 
Consider ... <the following> situation. A student has an appointment with a professor at 10 o’clock. The student 
finally appears in her office at 11 o’clock. Upon seeing the student, the professor says to her Well, if you are ready, 
let’s go over the test. ... The professor’s saying If you are ready does not imply that she is hypothesizing the 
possibility of the student’s being ready. Given the power relationship between the professor and her student and the 
circumstance of the student having made the professor wait for an hour, there is no mistaking that the student is 
ready. The professor’s use of the conditional expression If you are ready indicates that she sees the need to reaffirm 
the power relationship between the student and herself. (pp. 256-257) 
 
10.5. Pleonastic conditionals 
 
These are rhetorical conditionals in which the Q-clause is a repetition of the P-clause: 
(717) 
a. 
[“I can’t reach him. He must have switched off his mobile phone.” — “Well,] if you can’t reach him, you 
can’t reach him. [Try again tomorrow.]” 
 
 
b. 
[If I do it to the best of my ability then perhaps we’ll have a reasonable outcome.] If I fail it, well, I fail it. 
[I’m a realist. I don’t sit here thinking about how this is going to affect me politically...]  (COB-W) 
The following illustrate possible variants of standard pleonastic conditionals: 
(718) 
a. 
[“Don’t worry about these papers. I’ll help you.” — “But...”] — “If I say I’ll help you, I’ll help you.” 
 
 
b. 
[“Ted says he won’t come.”] — “If he won’t come, he must stay at home, mustn’t he?” 
 
 
c. 
So if you want to snivel away, you snivel away.  (COB-S) 
As is clear from the examples, pleonastic conditionals may have various communicative functions. The basic 
function appears to be that of conveying the message that the speaker accepts what she considers as an 
inescapable fact. In (717a) there is the additional message that the hearer would be well-advised to do the same. 
In (718a) the additional message is that the hearer should not doubt the inevitability of Q following from P. The 
same is true of (718b), where the speaker stresses that there are no alternative conclusions to be drawn from P: if 
Ted won’t come, the inevitable conclusion is that he will have to stay at home. No other alternatives, such as the 
speaker staying at home too or postponing her going, can be taken into consideration. 
In standard pleonastic conditionals like (717a-b) there is a tendency for the Q-clause to be a precise repetition 
(echo) of the P-clause (which therefore always precedes the Q-clause). This tendency is strong enough to 
overrule the normal grammatical tendency to replace noun phrases by pro-forms on their second occurrence. 
Thus, (719a) is at least as natural as (719b): 
(719) 
a. 
If Ted won’t come, (then) Ted won’t come. 

 
225
 
 
b. 
If Ted won’t come, (then) he won’t come. 
 
10.6. Conclusion 
 
10.6.1. Summary 
 
In this chapter we have identified a number of types and subtypes of rhetorical conditionals: 
(a) ‘Utterance conditionals’ differ from case-specifying-P conditionals in that the cases identified by the P-clause 
are not the cases in which Q is claimed to be true or in which the Q-situation is claimed to actualize, but the 
cases in which it is possible, meaningful or relevant to utter the Q-clause. We have identified six subclasses: 
(i) In ‘relevance conditionals’, the P-clause explains the relevance of uttering the Q-clause, i.e. it expresses the 
condition under which it is pragmatically relevant for the speaker to utter (and for the hearer to decode) the 
Q-clause. For example: I am not a coward, if that is what you think. 
(ii) In ‘anchoring-P conditionals’, the P-clause is merely used to provide a starting point for the utterance of the 
Q-clause. It is a kind of rhetorical linking device to heighten coherence by anchoring the Q-clause into the 
ongoing discourse. For example: If she was surprised by my statement, she gave no indication of it. 
(iii) In ‘performative-Q conditionals’, P expresses either the reason why the speaker utters a performative Q-
statement, or a necessary condition for uttering it. For example: If that’s the way you treat me, I advise you 
to change your attitude; If she takes part in the race, I bet she comes in last. 
(iv) In ‘metalinguistic-Q conditionals’, P expresses a condition for uttering a metalinguistic Q-statement. For 
example: If he has murdered once, {I assume / I think / I conclude / it means} that he will murder again. 
(v) In ‘nonassertoric-Q utterance conditionals’, the P-clause expresses either a condition for the Q-utterance or 
what induces the speaker to utter the Q-clause. The Q-clause expresses either a directive or a nonassertoric 
question. For example: If you must quarrel with your partner, don’t do it before your child. / If you’re not 
too busy, what’s Jim’s e-mail address? 
(vi) In ‘commenting-Q utterance conditionals’, the P-clause introduces a topic and the Q-clause expresses a 
comment on this topic. For example: If he hasn’t solved the problem, that doesn’t mean that he’s not 
intelligent. 
(b) In ‘comparing conditionals’, the ‘if P, Q’ construction is used merely to compare P and Q, i.e. to express 
some degree of similarity or contrast between the two propositions. We have distinguished the following 
subtypes: 
(i) In ‘similarity-expressing conditionals’, the speaker expresses the similarity between the two situations (or 
between participants in the situations) and affirms his belief that the Q-situation is as factual as the P-
situation. For example: If the poor will suffer, so will the rich. 
(ii) ‘Contrastive conditionals’ express dissimilarity between the two situations or between participants in the two 
situations. For example: If Brussels is the busiest city in Belgium, Bruges is the most beautiful. 
(iii) ‘Gradation conditionals’ are like similarity-expressing or contrastive conditionals, but at the same time they 
express a difference of gradation (similar to the comparative or superlative degrees of adjectives). For 
example: If you think Pete’s children are badly behaved, you should see Diana’s twins. 
(iv) ‘Concessive-P conditionals’ express a concessive relation between P and Q: He’s achieved a lot, if not in 
national politics, at least in his own borough. 
(c) In ‘commenting-P conditionals’, the P-clause expresses the speaker’s comment on the contents of the Q-
clause or on the conditions under which she is uttering the Q-clause. We have distinguished between the 
following subtypes: 
(i) In ‘downtoning-P conditionals’ the (sometimes elliptic) P-clause weakens the strength of an expression in the 
Q-clause or reduces (casts doubt on) the likelihood or possibility of the actualization of the Q-situation: 
There will only be some fifty people there, if not less. 
(ii) ‘Boosting-P conditionals’ are commenting-P conditionals in which the (sometimes elliptic) P-clause has a 
boosting, rather than downtoning, effect on one of the constituents of the Q-clause. For example: She’s one 
of the best students, if not THE best, we’ve ever had. 
(iii) In ‘evaluating-P conditionals’, the comment in the P-clause represents a kind of evaluation of what is said or 
presupposed in the Q-clause. We have distinguished three possibilities. Firstly, there are ‘truth-evaluating-P 
conditionals’, in which the comment expressed in the P-clause concerns the degree to which the content of 
the Q-clause is true (e.g. If you wanted the truth, his deal on ‘Sonnet’ was not that great). Secondly, there 
are ‘content-evaluating-P conditionals’, in which the P-clause expresses the speaker’s comment on the 

 
226
contents of the Q-clause or of the clause or sentence preceding the P-clause (e.g. With young and developing 
choreographers, the Royal Ballet’s artistic directorship should—if I may apply Walter Bagehot’s three 
functions of constitutional monarchy—advise, encourage and warn). Thirdly, there are ‘presupposition-
evaluating-P conditionals’, in which the comment expressed in the P-clause does not concern the semantic 
content of Q as a whole, but only the justifiedness of a pragmatic presupposition of the Q-proposition: the 
P-clause questions, cancels, or otherwise comments on a presupposition conveyed by the Q-proposition 
(e.g. Could the murder—if it was murder—have been committed after 9 p.m.?). 
(iv) ‘Metalinguistic-P conditionals’ are commenting-P conditionals in which the P-clause comments on the form 
of the Q-clause, on the choice of words in it, or on the pronunciation of a word: If I could bring the bible in 
here, the principle seems to be ‘an eye for an eye’. 
(v) In a ‘speech condition-defining-P conditional’, the P-clause defines the conditions under which the speaker 
utters the Q-proposition: If I may speak for myself, I don’t think it’s a good idea. 
(vi) ‘Reminding-P conditionals’ are commenting-P conditionals in which the P-clause serves as a reminder: If I 
may remind you, you’ve got an appointment in half an hour. 
(vii) ‘Hedging-P conditionals’ are commenting-P conditionals in which the P-clause serves as a hedge that 
renders the Q-assertion more tentative or diplomatic, i.e. which softens its unpleasantness, abruptness, etc. 
or renders it more polite. For example: I’ll go home now, if I may. / If I may be {personal / so bold}, you 
look wonderful tonight. 
(d) ‘Pseudo-implicatives’ are conditionals which look like implicatives but are not because they are used 
ironically (to achieve a special communicative effect): If you spit on the floor in your own house, you may do it 
here. 
(e) ‘Pleonastic conditionals’ are rhetorical conditionals in which the Q-clause is a repetition of the P-clause: So if 
you want to snivel away, you snivel away. 
The various types and subtypes of rhetorical conditionals are brought together in table 2. (It should also be 
borne in mind that if a given conditional is a member of one category, that does not automatically prevent it from 
also being a member of another category. In other words, the categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive.)

10.6.2. Syntactic integration 
 

 
227
The distinction between ‘rhetorical’ and ‘case-specifying’ conditionals has been presented as one that hinges on 
semantic, pragmatic and functional characteristics only. However, it is worth noting that in (at least some types 
of) rhetorical conditionals, the P-clause appears to be less integrated into the Q-clause than is the case in case-
specifying conditionals. There are significant differences between the various types of rhetorical conditionals as 
far as this question is concerned, and we will not examine the degrees of syntactic (non)integration of P-clauses 
in a detailed way. However, there appear to be two observations that are worth making. First, while then can 
systematically be added between the P-clause and the Q-clause of a case-specifying conditional, there are several 
types of rhetorical conditionals in which this is not, or hardly, possible. For example: 
(720) 
a. 
If you’re hungry, (*then) there’s some food in the fridge.  (relevance conditional) 
 
 
b. 
If she was surprised by my statement, (*then) she gave no indication of it.  (anchoring-P conditional) 
 
 
c. 
If Brussels is the busiest city in Belgium, (??then) Bruges is the most beautiful.  (contrastive conditional) 
 
 
d. 
If he hasn’t solved this problem, (??then) this does not mean that he’s not intelligent.  (commenting-Q 
conditional) 
 
 
e. 
If you want the truth, (*then) it was Bill who broke into your house.  (truth-evaluating-P conditional) 
 
 
f. 
If I may use one of my son’s favourite expressions, (*then) that’s a load of crap.  (metalinguistic-P 
conditional) 
 
 
g. 
If I may speak for myself, (*then) I don’t think it’s a good idea.  (speech condition-defining-P conditional) 
 
 
h. 
If I may remind you, (*then) you’ve got an appointment in half an hour.  (reminding-P conditional) 
 
 
i. 
If I may be {personal / so bold}, (*then) you look wonderful tonight.  (hedging-P conditional) 
 
 
j. 
So if you want to snivel away, (*then) you snivel away.  (pleonastic conditional) 
Secondly, it may be interesting to refer to Dutch and German, which normally have inversion in a case-
specifying conditional in which the P-clause comes first. There are various types of rhetorical conditional in 
which inversion is not possible. This has been noted for relevance conditionals by Dik (1990: 254) and König & 
van der Auwera (1988). The following examples are from Dutch: 
(721) 
a. 
Als het regent, (dan) wordt je nat.  (case-specifying) 
 
 
 
‘If it rains, (then) get you wet’ 
 
 
b. 
*Als het regent, je wordt nat. 
 
 
 
‘If it rains, you get wet’ 
(722) 
a. 
*Als je eten wil, (dan) vind je er in de ijskast.  (ungrammatical as relevance conditional) 
 
 
 
‘If you want food, (then) find you some in the fridge’ 
 
 
b. 
Als je eten wil, je vindt er in de ijskast. 
 
 
 
‘If you want food, you find some in the fridge’ 
The fact that Dutch and German relevance conditionals do not show inversion in the Q-clause is a clear 
indication that in these languages the P-clause of a relevance conditional is syntactically less integrated into the 
Q-clause than in case-specifying-P conditionals—see also van Belle (1997: 218-219). If Q-clauses can be used 
without inversion, it means that they do not need their P-clause. In other words, Q-clauses without inversion can 
be used as syntactically independent sentences, which can be fully interpreted in isolation. 
Relevance conditionals are not the only type of rhetorical conditionals that do not, or may not,15 show 
inversion in Dutch or German. This is clear from the following examples: 
(723) 
a. 
Is hij niet rijk, {hij heeft / *heeft hij} toch wat spaarcenten. 
 
 
 
‘Is he not rich [=if he is not rich], {he does have / *does he have} some savings.’  (concessive-P 
conditional) 
 
 
b. 
Als je de waarheid wil weten, {ik hou / *hou ik} niet van vis. 
 
 
 
‘If you want to know the truth, {I do not / *do I not} like fish.’  (truth-evaluating-P conditional) 
 
 
c. 
Als het niet voldoende is dat ik een maagzweer heb, {ik ben / *ben ik} ook diabetes aan het krijgen. 
 
 
 
‘If it is not enough that I have a stomach ulcer, {I am also getting / *am I also getting} diabetes.’  (content-
evaluating-P conditional) 
 
 
d. 
Als ik kort mag zijn, {hij heeft / *heeft hij} niet het recht om in deze zaak tussen te komen. 
 
 
 
‘If I may be brief, {he does not have / *does he not have} the right to interfere in this matter.’  
(metalinguistic-P conditional) 
 
 
e. 
Als ik je een compliment mag geven, {je ziet / *zie je} er prachtig uit. 
 
 
 
‘If I may pay you a compliment, {you look / *do you look} wonderful.’  (hedging-P conditional) 
                                              
15 Some Dutch conditionals of the types illustrated below can, or must, show inversion. The point, however, is that some other 
examples cannot, which proves that in these types the syntactic relation between the two clauses is looser than it is in case-
specifying conditionals. 

 
228
In sum, though the distinction between ‘rhetorical’ and ‘case-specifying’ conditionals examined in this chapter 
has been made on the basis of semantic, pragmatic and functional considerations, there is some evidence for the 
claim that there is also a syntactic correlate to this distinction: at least some rhetorical conditionals show a looser 
syntactic connection between the two clauses than case-specifying conditionals do. 

 
229
Chapter 11 
 
Syntactically marked conditional structures 
 
 
 
In most conditionals, the P-clause is syntactically subordinated to the Q-clause (which may itself be a head 
clause or a subclause) and is syntactically fully integrated into it. However, there are also conditionals which do 
not have such an unmarked syntactic structure. It is the purpose of this chapter to examine these in detail. (It 
should be borne in mind that the patterns are not necessarily mutually exclusive.) 
 
11.1. Postscript-P conditionals 
 
These are conditionals in which the P-clause is not fully integrated into the Q-clause but is added as a kind of 
afterthought (and hence follows the Q-clause, with an intonational break between the two clauses). If the 
conditional in question is an actualization conditional, the postscript P-clause is a ‘restrictive postscript’: it 
restricts the validity of Q ‘a posteriori’: 
(724) 
a. 
I’ll drop in and see you at 10 tonight, if you will be alone.  (QUI) 
 
 
b. 
[There’s something else—something even worse.] I shall just have to tell somebody, Mrs Stevens—if you 
can bear it.  (DOC) 
 
 
c. 
I won’t go to the supermarket—provided I’ve got enough food for tonight. 
 
 
d. 
I won’t go to the supermarket, not if I’ve got enough food for tonight. 
 
 
e. 
I don’t think I can afford this kind of car—unless I took on a second job, which is impossible. 
The loose syntactic connection between the Q-clause and the P-clause renders it possible for the postscript P-
clause to be followed by a resumptive marker for the Q-clause: 
(725) 
I won’t go to the supermarket—if I’ve got enough food for tonight, that is. 
Postscript-P conditionals may also be inferentials (e.g. He must be very rich—if he can afford a house like that) 
or relevance conditionals (e.g. Which of these cars is the more comfortable—if you had to make a choice?). In 
these cases the P-clause is not a restrictive postscript: it does not restrict the validity of Q. However, postscript-P 
conditionals are more often actualization-conditionals (with a restrictive postscript). In that case there is an 
understanding that the actualization of the P-situation is a necessary condition for the actualization of the Q-
situation, hence that ‘not-P’ is sufficient for the nonactualization of the Q-situation (where P may be either [+p] 
or [-p] and Q may be either [+q] or [-q]). As we will see in section 12.4.2, this understanding is not so much a 
question of P being a semantic prerequisite for Q, as a question of interpretation, which is triggered by an 
implicature. 
If a restrictive postscript P-clause is introduced by unless, this conjunction is usually interpreted as ‘except 
iff’ (where iff means ‘if and only if’) or ‘(but) only if...not’, rather than simply ‘if...not’—see section 13.2: 
(726) 
a. 
This kind of dog is quite harmless, unless you tease it.  (The implication is that the only case in which ‘This 
kind of dog is quite harmless’ is not true is the case in which the dog is teased. In other words, teasing the 
dog is a necessary condition for the dog not being harmless.) 
 
 
b. 
We’ll go there tomorrow, unless there’s a lot of snow.  (There being a lot of snow is a necessary condition 
for us not going.) 
 
 
c. 
[“Write it all out 20 times!”] — “It would take me nearly 97 hours to do it, unless I did carbon copies, [and 
they might not work].”  (LOB) (Doing carbon copies is presented as a necessary condition for the work 
taking less than 97 hours.) 
 
 
d. 
I won’t do it—unless they threaten my life. 
As a rule, the postscript unless-clause is also taken to express a necessary condition if the Q-clause is negative: 
(727) 
You won’t get there in time, unless you take a taxi.  (Taking a taxi is represented as a necessary A-condition for 
your getting there in time.) 
The only exception is when the unless-clause is an identifying copular clause. In that case unless it is / was... just 
means ‘except’: 

 
230
(728) 
a. 
There wasn’t one talented player amongst them, unless it was Peter.  (=except perhaps Peter) 
 
 
b. 
[“I can look after myself,” said Tate in a low voice.] “I never saw a man less capable of doing so, unless it is 
Mr Dunsand.”  (SLSD) (=except Mr Dunsand) 
 
11.2. Conditional anacolutha 
 
In spoken English, a specificational conditional is often an ‘anacoluthon’. The Routledge Dictionary of 
Language and Linguistics (1996: 20-21) defines an anacoluthon as a “sudden change of an originally planned 
sentence construction to an alternative, inconsistent one during sentence production due to unplanned speech. 
Anacoluthon is considered to be the result of self-correction during speech or also the blend of two different 
constructions.” Typical examples are The reason I did it was because I was ill (which, in spite of being a quite 
common construction, might be expected to contain that instead of because in noninformal English) and What 
I’ll do is, I’ll send him a letter (instead of What I’ll do is send him a letter).16 The following are similar 
specificational anacolutha that take the form of a conditional sentence: 
(729) 
a. 
The only reason I’d do that would be if there were problems with the computer.  (This is a blending of ‘The 
only reason I’d do that would be that there were problems...’ and ‘I would only do this if there were 
problems...’.) 
 
 
b. 
Your only chance of entering the building is if you know the various security codes.  (This is a blending of 
‘Your only chance of entering the building is to know the various security codes’ and ‘It is only if you know 
the various security codes that you can enter the building.’) 
 
11.3. Nominal-Q conditionals 
 
These are conditionals in which Q is expressed in the form of a nominalization: 
(730) 
a. 
[No one at school knew of her birthday.  Certainly, she trusted, none of the pupils did, although she sensed a 
slight reddening under her high cheekbones as just for a few seconds she contemplated] her embarrassment 
if one of her classes broke out into “Happy Birthday, Mrs Stevens!”  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
The reality if President Bush wins on 3 November [is that a fourteen year old girl could be sent to the 
electric chair if she has an abortion after being raped.]  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[The club should include a method of dealing with creditors such as ourselves who have long outstanding 
debts. On two occasions Mr Brealey was asked to make written proposals to the company] as to the manner 
of the payment of our debt, if he were to acquire the club. [We received no written proposals.]  (COB-W) 
(=‘as to how he would pay our debt...’) 
In such examples, the P-clause is typically actualization-conditioning, never premise-expressing. 
 
11.4. Displaced-P conditionals 
 
In some conditionals, the P-clause is ‘displaced’ into a special position. More specifically, it is added, not to its 
Q-clause, but to the head clause governing the Q-clause. In that case the Q-proposition is not expressed by the 
entire head clause but rather by a subclause embedded in this.17 ‘Metalinguistic-Q conditionals’ (see section 
10.1.4) are automatically of this syntactic type, which is illustrated by the following: 
(731) 
a. 
If you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
Even if he does not support it any more, I am convinced we must go through with the scheme. 
 
 
c. 
If it all works, we hope the Council will feel obliged to continue it.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[When we go around garden centres I wish we had more room for things, but] if we had more ground I 
doubt if we should ever go out, [we’d never get it all done].  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
And if Paul tries to sell me one of his miserable ices this afternoon, I don’t promise not to plaster it all over 
his face. Or hit him over the head with one of his bottles of minerals.  (COB-W) 
In the case of (731a-c) one might wonder whether do you think, I am convinced and we hope are really the head 
clauses, or whether they are some kind of attitudinal ‘parenthetical’ expressions. However, the latter analysis 
                                              
16 The following is an authentic example from COB-S: What we’d do is I’d try and ask them exactly why they’ve required a private 
interview. 
17 This formal characteristic is also found with ‘NEG-raising’ structures: In I don’t think he’s ill the negation is conventionally 
interpreted as bearing on he’s ill rather than on I think. 

 
231
would not work for (731d-e): I doubt and I don’t promise cannot be omitted and actually determine the form—
indirect question or infinitival complement, respectively—of the subclause expressing the Q-proposition. 
On the semantic level, it could be argued that expressions like I think, etc. belong to the ‘modal layer’ rather 
than to the ‘propositional layer’. This seems to correspond to their semantics, which is no longer propositional 
but in fact closer to the semantics of subjective modality. This would imply that these expressions are no longer 
main clause predicates under which other predicates are embedded, but that they have (or are moving towards?) 
some kind of auxiliary status, and have become (or are becoming) transparent for certain processes, such as 
negation (see the possibility of ‘NEG-raising’) or particular types of adverbials. 
Next to examples like (731a-c), there are also examples such as the following: 
(732) 
a. 
And you’ll be very sensible, if you can, to stop using your right hand completely.  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
[Julia Stevens walked round to her former pupil’s house during the lunch-break that Friday,] wishing, if she 
could, to speak to Kevin’s mother.  (DOC) 
Here the P-clause is moved forward, but not fronted. That is, it follows rather than precedes the superordinate 
clause on which its Q-clause depends. This is somewhat special because the basic format for P-clauses 
depending on a syntactically subordinate Q-clause is the following: 
(733) 
a. 
And you’ll be very sensible to stop using your right hand completely if you can. 
 
 
b. 
...wishing to speak to Kevin’s mother if she could. 
If a P-clause is displaced, its special syntactic position does not alter the fact that, semantically, the P-clause 
depends on the Q-clause. (For this reason the P-clause can always be moved to the position after the subordinate 
Q-clause.) 
It should be noted, finally, that unlike metalinguistic-Q conditionals, performative-Q conditionals are not 
displaced-Q conditionals: 
(734) 
a. 
If my niece comes to the party I {ask / beg / warn} you to stay away from her. 
 
 
b. 
If she takes part in the race, I bet she comes in last. 
If we remove the performative clause from (734a), to get If my niece comes to the party, stay away from her, we 
have a command, which is not the same as something asked or begged, and if we remove the performative verb 
from (734b) we get If she takes part in the race, she’ll comes in last, in which Q is simply a prediction. This 
means that it cannot be that in performative-Q conditionals where the performative verb has a clausal 
complement, the performative verbs simply make explicit the speaker’s use of, attitude to, etc. the content of the 
complement clause as is the case in metalinguistic-Q conditionals and in (731a-e). 
 
11.5. Stacked-P conditionals 
 
By stacked P-clauses we mean P-clauses that belong to the same conditional sentence but have a different scope, 
as in the following:

a. 
If Jerry accepts the job if he is offered it, (then) his Mum will be delighted. 
 
 
b.

(COB-S)

[Nothing sets the scene so well as a roll-top bath, standing on its own surrounded by mahogany panelling.] 
If you haven’t the space, however, modern baths can still look good if they’re boxed in with panelling, 
painted or stencilled in keeping with the rest of the room.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[But relatives say that some of the men had been murdered, and that] if others had committed suicide their 
deaths could have been prevented if they had received adequate supervision and medical care.  (COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
If you’re a British prisoner convicted of a crime, if you ask, you can be transferred to a prison near your

The first two sentences illustrate two different syntactic structures. In (735a) the syntactic structure is ‘If [Q2 if 
P2], (then) Q1’, which is interpreted as ‘If P1, then Q1’, where P1=‘if P2, Q2’ (if Jerry is offered the job, he 
accepts it). That is, the interpretation of (735a) is: If [if Jerry is offered the job] he accepts it, then his Mum will 
be delighted. In (735b) the syntactic structure is ‘If P1, then [Q2 if P2]’, which is interpreted as ‘If P1, then Q1’, 
where Q1=‘if P2, Q2’ (if the interest rate goes up the market price goes down). Sentences (735c-d) are also of the 
latter type. Sentence (735e), finally, is similar to them, except that there is an additional if-clause, so that the 
meaning is ‘If P1, (then) Q1’, where Q1=‘if P2, Q2’, where Q2=‘if P3, Q3’. We here have to do with a recursive 
process which can in principle go on indefinitely. In sum, there are two types of stacked-P conditionals: (a) ‘If 

 
232
[Q2 if P2], (then) Q1’, and (b) ‘If P1, then [Q2 if P2]’. In both cases the embedded ‘[Q2 if P2]’ can belong to a 
different possible-world type from the remaining proposition, which is Q1 in type (a) and P1 in type (b): 
(736) 
a. 
If Jill would slap the director’s face if he told her off, (then) she’s not really an ideal public relations officer.  
(type (a); the conditional with the embedded P-clause is tentative-P in isolation, but is used as the closed P-
clause of the overall conditional.) 
 
 
b. 
If Jill has slapped the director’s face, (then) if the director insisted she could be fired.  (type (b); the 
conditional with the embedded P-clause is tentative-P in isolation, but is used as the apodosis of an overall 
closed-P or open-P conditional.) 
The latter example runs counter to Sweetser’s (1996: 323) claim that in stacked-P conditionals “the entire 
embedded conditional takes on the verb forms appropriate to the epistemic alignment of the higher protasis.” 
This erroneous claim follows from the fact that Sweetser is only considering examples like the following, which 
is in keeping with her claim: 
(737) 
If you had Triple-A, then if you went to a telephone, you could solve your problem.  (=type [b]) 
Sweetser also argues that in such conditionals the entire embedded conditional (and not just its P-clause) is 
represented as “less likely”, and that “this appears to be inherited from the counterfactuality of the higher 
protasis” (p. 324). In our opinion, the latter claim cannot be correct. Tentativeness is quite distinct from 
counterfactuality, so we do not see how the latter idea could lead to the former. Moreover, tentativeness is 
certainly not dependent on a counterfactual context, for we observe that the embedded conditional of (737) can 
also follow a noncounterfactual higher P-clause: 
(738) 
a. 
If you have Triple-A, then, surely, if you went to a telephone, you could solve your problem. [You are just 
too lazy to try it.]  (The higher P-clause is closed or open; the embedded conditional is tentative-P.) 
 
 
b. 
If you obtained Triple-A, then, surely, if you went to a telephone, you could solve your problem. [Or would 
you be too lazy to try it?]  (The higher P-clause is tentative; the embedded conditional is tentative-P.) 
It should also be noted that there is no difference of interpretation between the second type of stacking 
construction (=type [b]) and a conditional with two coordinated P-clauses—see also Woods (1997: 72): 
(739) 
a. 
If this house is a listed building, then if they built on a verandah, they acted illegally. 
 
 
b. 
If this house is a listed building and (if) they built on a verandah, they acted illegally. 
In the examples of stacked-P conditionals that we have discussed so far, the higher P-clause is each time of the 
case-specifying type, while the embedded conditional is an implicative one, i.e. an actualization conditional or an 
inferential (see section 3.7). However, it is also possible for the implicative conditional to be embedded under an 
utterance-licensing (e.g. relevance-expressing) P-clause. In that case the higher P-clause cannot split up the 
implicative conditional. Compare: 
(740) 
a. 
If you like the country so much, why do you always go to London if you have time off? 
 
 
b. 
Why do you always go to London if you have time off, if you like the country so much? 
 
 
c. 
*Why do you always go to London if you like the country so much if you have time off? 
Haegeman (1984: 488) notes that this means that the P-clause of (what she calls) an “occurrence-conditional” 
has a “central” role in the sentence, while the P-clause of an “utterance-conditional” has a “peripheral” role. In 
our terminology, this means that the P-clause of a case-specifying conditional is more strongly semantically 
integrated in the sentence than the P-clause of an utterance conditional (or, more generally, a rhetorical 
conditional). Though this may well be correct, we are not sure whether Haegeman’s test provides conclusive 
evidence, for we observe a similar restriction on the addition of a higher case-specifying (e.g. premise-
expressing) P-clause to an implicative conditional: 
(741) 
a. 
If this house is a listed building, (then) if they built on a verandah they would act illegally. 
 
 
b. 
If they built on a verandah, (then) they would act illegally if this house is a listed building. 
 
 
c. 
?They would act illegally if this house is a listed building if they built on a verandah. 
A better piece of evidence that the P-clause of a rhetorical conditional has a more peripheral role than a case-
specifying P-clause is that only the latter type of P-clause can be mopped up in the reference of a verbal pro-
form (like do so): 
(742) 
a. 
You will be punished if you do that, and so will Mary.  (=...and Mary will also be punished if she does that) 
 
 
b. 
If you want to know, Mary smokes dope, and so does Bill.  (‘and so does Bill’ is not interpreted as ‘if you 
want to know, Bill also smokes dope’.) 

 
233
 
 
c. 
The murder—if it WAS murder—was committed around 5 p.m., and so was the burglary.  (The last clause 
can be interpreted neither as ‘The burglary too was committed around 5 p.m., if it WAS murder’, nor as ‘The 
burglary—if it WAS a burglary—was committed around 5 p.m.’) 
 
11.6. Conditionals with coordinated P-clauses or Q-clauses 
 
A conditional may involve two coordinate P-clauses and/or Q-clauses: 
(743) 
a. 
If Vivian is selected {and / but} Rose isn’t, the friendship between the two of them will be under severe 
strain. 
 
 
b. 
If Vivian is selected (and Rose isn’t), Bill will be delighted but Ted will be furious. 
In these examples, two P-propositions are coordinated under one if. It is also possible to coordinate two if-
clauses: If Chris is a boy, and if Toni is a girl, then they can marry each other. 
In some cases the first of the coordinate if-clauses has wider scope than the second, so that the (syntactically) 
coordinate P-clauses are actually interpreted as stacked: 
(744) 
a. 
If inflation rises to 6 per cent and if you put £100 under your mattress and take it out at the end of the year, 
you will find that its worth has diminished to £94.  [adapted from COB-S] 
 
 
b. 
If our mysterious Mr. X exists and (if) this information is anything to go by, it may be the same person as 
committed the Yorkshire murders. 
In (744a) the ‘if you put...you will find’ scenario (expressed by an open conditional) is embedded in a fictional 
scenario of 6% inflation rate expressed by the first P-clause. This means that the sentence is interpreted as 
follows: 
(745) 
P1 <if inflation rises to 6 per cent>, then Q1 <=if P2 <if you put £100 under your mattress and take it out at the 
end of the year>, then Q2 <you’ll find that worth has diminished to £94>> 
The fact that (744a) is interpreted as (745) is not surprising, given that stacked-P constructions of the type ‘if P1, 
then [if P2, Q2]’ are semantically equivalent to ‘If P1 and P2, then Q2’—see section 11.5 above. 
If there is a single, but coordinate, if-clause, the reference is to a single composite condition. If two if-clauses 
are conjoined, two different conditions are stated. In that case the two conditions may or may not have to be 
fulfilled at the same time. In the latter case and is equivalent to or. Compare: 
(746) 
a. 
If you push this pedal and turn the ignition key, the motor starts.  (There is one coordinate P-clause. 
Performing the two actions together forms a necessary condition for the motor to start.) 
 
 
b. 
[What do I do to start the motor?]—The motor will start if you press this pedal and if you turn the ignition 
key.  (There are two coordinated P-clauses. Only our pragmatic knowledge about cars can tell us whether 
the two conditions have to be fulfilled at the same time or whether one of them is sufficient.) 
 
 
c. 
[There are two ways to start the motor.] The motor will start if you press this pedal and if you turn the 
ignition key.  (The preceding context makes clear that ‘and’ means ‘or’.) 
 
 
d. 
If you’ve finished your supper and if you haven’t got any homework, you can go out to play.  (Our 
pragmatic knowledge of the world teaches us that both conditions are necessary.) 
 
11.7. Syntactically incomplete conditionals 
 
11.7.1. Covert-P conditionals 
 
The Q-clause of a conditional of one of the canonical patterns is normally felt to be incomplete—sometimes 
even unintelligible—without an overt P-clause. For example, a clause like I would be happy is not a complete 
sentence on its own. It will automatically suggest the question ‘if what?’ on the part of the hearer. 
(747) 
“They’d have destroyed me utterly.” — “I really think they would, Mr Tate.”  (SLSD) 
This scrap of conversation cannot normally be used discourse-initially. For a full understanding of it it is 
obviously required that both speaker and hearer have in mind what the counterfactual situation is that would 
have destroyed Mr Tate. This does not mean that P-less Q-clauses are unusual. They are actually quite common 
if the P-clause is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context. An example of this is (748), uttered 
by a mother who catches her child on the point of doing something naughty: 
(748) 
I’ll smack you!  (Johnson-Laird 1986) (=If you do that, I’ll smack you!) 

 
234
There are many similar cases in which the use of a verb form typical of a Q-clause can be explained from the 
presence of a covert (ellipted, “suppressed” [Palmer 1986]) P-clause: 
(749) 
a. 
I COULD answer that question.  (=I could answer that question {if I wanted to / if it was put to me / etc.}.) 
 
 
b. 
I COULD have answered that question.  (=I could have answered that question {if I had wanted to / if it had 
been put to me / etc.}.) 
It goes without saying that, in tentative-P and counterfactual-P examples, it is often not realistic to suggest that 
speaker and hearer have a specific covert P-clause in mind. It is sufficient that they interpret the sentences in a 
similar tentative or counterfactual world. Sentences (749a-b) more or less just say ‘I can answer that question’, 
but relate this statement of ability to a tentative or counterfactual P-world in which this ability is given 
expression. 
The following are the most important types of sentence in which a conditional form is found in the head 
clause without there being an overt or contextually recoverable if-clause: 
 
11.7.1.1. The type would {like / love / hate / prefer} to 
 
The conditional forms would and (in sentences with a first person subject)18 should are used before the verbs 
like, prefer, hate and love in order to express a present feeling about the (un)desirability of the actualization of 
the situation expressed in the infinitival clause. 
(750) 
a. 
Jeremy would like to leave early.  (=Jeremy wishes to leave early.) 
 
 
b. 
Bill would like (to have) a moped. 
 
 
c. 
I’d prefer to leave at once, if you don’t mind. 
 
 
d. 
“I’ve always thought I’d like a lot of children” he said.  (QUI) 
This use of would / should has become stereotyped, so that a covert condition is not always recoverable. In some 
of the above sentences it could be something like ‘if possible’, ‘given the choice’, ‘if that were necessary’, etc. 
Alternatively, a condition often seems to be hidden in the verb complement: 
(751) 
a. 
I wouldn’t like to meet him on a dark night. 
 
 
b. 
I’d hate to have to live with him. 
 
 
c. 
She’d prefer not to have been born in that ghetto. 
These could be paraphrased as ‘If I met him on a dark night, I wouldn’t like that’, ‘If I had to live with him, I’d 
hate that’ and ‘If she had not been born in that ghetto, she’d prefer that’, respectively. On the other hand, 
(752) 
I wouldn’t want to meet him on a dark night. 
cannot be paraphrased as ‘*If I met him on a dark night, I wouldn’t want that’. This is because, unlike I would 
(not) {like / hate / prefer / love} that, the clause I would (not) want that cannot be interpreted as ‘I would (not) 
find that {nice / pleasant / enjoyable / satisfactory}’. In other words, the group of verbs with which would refers 
to a present feeling about the enjoyability of a future situation is restricted to the verbs like, prefer, hate, and 
love. 
 
11.7.1.2. Would / should for tentativeness 
 
Would and (first person) should can also be found with some verbs and expressions where the use of the 
conditional tense instead of the present tense makes for greater tentativeness. Here too, we could often posit a 
covert P-clause. In many cases, however, it could be argued that the conditional tense forms should be described 
in terms of some independent semantic value of ‘tentativeness’ which does not (any longer) need to be explained 
by means of a covert-Q conditional. (Coates [1983] notes that ‘Hypothetical WOULD is also used pragmatically 
                                              
18 According to Jespersen (1932: 316) “the same vacillation is found in questions in the second person: Should you like? is the form 
preferred by grammarians, but Would you like? is heard very often colloquially.” Jespersen adduces the following examples: 
 
(i) 
Should you like to go to school at Canterbury? 
 
(ii) 
Should you like to? 
 
(iii) We are going to bring you lunch. What should you like? 
 
(iv) You wouldn’t like to stay behind without mother, should you? 
 
However, in present-day Standard English the use of should in second-person questions is quite rare. In the wh-question of (iii) it 
sounds quite odd, though not impossible (in literature at any rate). The combination of would and should in (iv) is distinctly odd. 

 
235
to express politeness or tentativeness rather than a genuine hypothesis’ (p. 216) and points out (p. 217) that in an 
example such as oh no, we wouldn’t dare play with you, it is not easy to construct a covert condition.) 
The following are the verbs and expressions with which we can find would / should for tentativeness: 
(a) some expressions of volition 
(753) 
a. 
Would you mind opening the door for me?  (...if I asked you to) 
 
 
b. 
I should wish to voice a different opinion. 
 
 
c. 
Would you be interested in doing my job for a couple of weeks? 
 
 
d. 
Would you care for a drink? 
(b) some verbs of saying 
(754) 
a. 
[“Do I seem all right?”] — “I’d say you look superb—wonderful!” 
 
 
b. 
[As a first step to the new life you desperately need,] I’d suggest assertiveness training. (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
I should say she was at least fifty. 
 
 
d. 
I would exhort all students and intelligent readers to make more use of reference-books.  (Kruisinga 1931: 
483) 
(c) some verbs of inert cognition 
(755) 
a. 
[“He must be at least 45.”] — “I should imagine so.” 
 
 
b. 
I wouldn’t know what they smell like, drugs.  (DOC) 
 
 
c. 
I should think we can get at least 200 pounds for this. 
 
 
d. 
I wouldn’t know how to cope with such problems. 
 
 
e. 
I’d expect you to know more about this. 
(d) the verbs seem and appear 
(756) 
a. 
It would {seem / appear} that there will be no more buses to town today. 
 
 
b. 
It was a very embarrassing situation, it would seem. 
Several things are worth noting here: 
(a) Sometimes ‘{would / should} + verb’ can yield other interpretations besides a tentative one. In fact, the same 
construction may sometimes receive different interpretations in different contexts. These interpretations are 
signalled by different intonation patterns. For example: 
(757) 
a. 
[“The shop gave me my money back for that mouldy cheese.”] — “I should think so!”  (=That’s the very 
least one could expect!) (This reading requires an intonation pattern with an equal, strong accent on each 
of ‘think’ and ‘so’, a rise on ‘think’ and a fall on ‘so’.) 
 
 
b. 
[“Is he in the library?”] — “I should think so.”  (One reading is ‘I’m not quite certain, but I am [strongly] 
of the opinion that...’ This reading requires that only ‘think’ be accented. There is a rise on ‘think’ and 
[from a much lower pitch] a rise on ‘so’. Another reading is that ‘I should think so’ expresses strong 
confirmation. This reading requires a drop in pitch before ‘think’ and a gradual rise over ‘think so’.) 
(b) Some of these verbs, particularly think and say, allow further ‘backshifting’ in order to enhance the 
tentativeness (i.e. ‘distancing’ from present reality): 
(758) 
a. 
[Maybe I’m not so sure, but I am, well,] I would have thought that maybe the word ‘exhibitioner’ as 
someone who holds an ‘exhibition’ was perhaps slightly more common than the word ‘exhibition’ itself.  
(COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
Personally, I would have said that £50 was not enough to cover all the expenses. 
 
 
c. 
I should have thought he could have left something for us, at least.  (=a criticism) 
 
 
d. 
I’d have said you could do better than this! 
The observation that would have {thought / said} can be used for tentativeness, without a counterfactual 
meaning, is in keeping with various other observations that can be made in connection with such sentences. 
Consider: 
(759) 
a. 
“I would have thought that getting married is the best thing she could do.” — [“I don’t think I agree with 
you. I think you’re clutching at male straws.”]  [adapted from COB-S] 
 
 
b. 
Oh, I think History and Geography ... can be counted as specialized subjects as much as Chemistry and—
and Physics and Biology, I would have thought.  (COB-S) 
 
 
c. 
[“About er him saying about him selling as you say crap...” — “Well that’s what he, that was his own word. 
I mean] I would have thought they probably know, they’re in the business aren’t they?”  (COB-S) 

 
236
In all three examples would have thought is combined with a complement clause in the present tense. This shows 
that would have thought is neither counterfactual nor referring to the past, but refers to a present opinion. (In 
(759c) the speaker gives evidence for actually holding that opinion now: I would have thought they probably 
know, they’re in the business, aren’t they?) In (759a) we also note the reply I don’t think I agree with you, which 
is a response to a real and present opinion having been given, showing an interpretation of I would have thought 
as ‘I (politely / tentatively express that I) think’. Sentence (759b) is also revealing in that the I think at the start is 
balanced by I would have thought at the end. Both mean roughly the same in terms of semantics—they both 
express a present opinion—but the speaker nods to politeness at the end. 
On the other hand, it goes without saying that would have {thought / said} can also be used with the 
counterfactual meaning typical of the Q-clause of a pattern 3 conditional: 
(760) 
[I was in heaven. At first I couldn’t work out why she had to have Prince playing at full volume on the stereo but 
after a few minutes I found out.] If there hadn’t been any music playing everyone within a mile radius would 
have thought I was trying to kill her—[her screams were so loud. Mind you, sometimes it was ME doing the 
screaming because I lost so much flesh from my back because of her fingernails.]  (COB-W) 
Out of context, the following is ambiguous between several readings: 
(761) 
I would have thought John was right about that. 
Under neutral sentence intonation, there are three readings. One interpretation is ‘I think John is right’. This 
implies that nothing definite is known about whether John is actually right or not. Would have thought expresses 
politeness (or hesitancy) twice: once by polite would and once by backshifting would think to would have 
thought. The second reading is ‘That would have been my opinion, but it turns out that I would have been 
wrong.’ The third reading is the counterfactual ‘That would have been my opinion if I had thought about it, 
which (for whatever reason) I didn’t’. In addition, a special accent on thought (i.e. I would have THOUGHT John 
was right about that) produces the reading ‘That would have been my opinion, and it turns out that I would have 
been right.’ 
(c) When would think or would have thought expresses a present opinion, the that-clause depending on it is 
neither tentative nor counterfactual if it uses the past tense or the present tense.19 The that-clause only expresses 
the contents of the thinking, and this remains the same, regardless of whether the head clause uses think, would 
think or would have thought: 
(762) 
a. 
I think the value of this vase is at least 200 pounds. 
 
 
b. 
I should think the value of this vase {was / is} at least 200 pounds. 
 
 
c. 
I should’ve thought the value of this vase {was / is} at least 200 pounds. 
The speaker can select any of these three possibilities to say what she thinks. The difference lies in the varying 
degrees of tentativeness of how she voices her opinion. 
(d) If a Q-clause with would think or would have thought combines with an overt P-clause, the Q-clause and the 
P-clause may or may not build a regular pattern 2 or 3 conditional. Compare (763) with (764a-c): 
(763) 
If somebody had said to me 15 years ago that Nick and I would be apart and I’d be pregnant with a friend’s baby, 
but living alone, I’d have thought it inconceivable.  (COB-W) (pattern 3) 
(764) 
a. 
If you have <any links with London> I would have thought that those links are to be stronger or are to 
become stronger rather than weaker.  (COB-S) (pattern 1 P-clause + pattern 3 Q-clause) 
 
 
b. 
If you are a Superintendent, I would have thought you could solve this kind of problem easily.  (idem) 
 
 
c. 
If you were going to say to me, “Well this doesn’t make any sense because I’m not looking for 
opportunities. I’m very content and very happy with what I’m doing. I’m not looking for changes 
particularly”, then I would have thought that round about that April May period those opportunities are 
going to be there anyway and you will one way or the other recognize them for being what they are as and 
when they arrive.  (COB-S) (pattern 2 P-clause + pattern 3 Q-clause) 
Notice also the ‘regular’ use of tenses in the that-clause depending on the Q-clause in (764b) and the ‘irregular’ 
use of the present or future tense in (764a) and (764c). 
                                              
19 Things are different, of course, if the that-clause uses the conditional or conditional perfect tense to express a tentative opinion 
about a tentative or counterfactual situation: 
 
(i) 
I would have thought that Jane would come if you asked her. 
 
(ii) 
I would have thought that Jane would have won if she’d entered the race. 

 
237
 
11.7.1.3. Q-clauses implying if I were you 
 
A third case of covert P-clause is constituted by tentative or counterfactual Q-clauses that are ‘P-less’ but imply 
if I were you or in your place. 
(765) 
a. 
I {shouldn’t / wouldn’t} count on his help. There is no reason why he should be interested. 
 
 
b. 
I {shouldn’t / wouldn’t} worry about these stains. They’ll come out in the wash. 
 
 
c. 
I {shouldn’t / wouldn’t} be too confident of winning the game. They have an excellent team. 
Note that should is somewhat more likely than would when there’s a stronger element of advice, whereas would 
is more likely when the hypothesis about the speaker’s own behaviour is more salient. Compare: 
(766) 
a. 
I {shouldn’t / (wouldn’t)} take any notice. It’ll just distract you from your work. 
 
 
b. 
“Should I take any notice?” — “Well I {wouldn’t / ?shouldn’t}.” 
The reason why shouldn’t is a little odd in (766b) is that it sounds like advice, which is incompatible with the 
emphasis on the subject I. 
 
11.7.1.4. Conditionals without a real link between the overt P-clause and the Q-clause 
 
There is also a covert (ellipted) P-clause in two types of conditional in which there is no direct link between the 
overt P-clause and the Q-clause. The first type is that in which the overt P-clause is really the Q-clause of a 
covert P-clause: 
(767) 
I won’t tell her off if there will be trouble.  (=I won’t tell her off if there will be trouble if I tell her off.) 
Apart from this type, there are inferential conditionals in which the epistemological basis for the conclusion is 
not expressed in the overt P-clause. The overt P-clause has a purely case-specifying function: 
(768) 
If there is treasure, it {must / should / ought to / will / may / can’t / needn’t} be hidden here. 
Here the truth of P (the existence of treasure) is not the basis for the Q-inference. The latter is based on a covert 
condition, which can be made overt by the addition of a premise-expressing P-clause: 
(769) 
a. 
If there is treasure, it must be hidden here if this old map is reliable. 
 
 
b. 
If there is treasure and (if) this old map is reliable, it must be hidden here. 
Clearly, the epistemological basis for the Q-conclusion is not the P about the existence of treasure, but the P 
about the reliability of the old map. (Needless to say, (769b) is of the stacking type of coordinated P-clauses that 
was discussed in section 11.6 above.) 
 
11.7.2. Covert-Q conditionals 
 
In these conditionals there is no overt Q-clause. We can distinguish the following possibilities: 
 
11.7.2.1. Conditionals whose Q-clause is deleted to avoid repetition 
 
In some cases the Q-clause of the conditional is dropped because it is recoverable from the preceding context: 
(770) 
a. 
[“How long <do I have to live>?” she asked simply. ... “Would you give up work if you were me?” — 
“Fairly soon, I think, yes.” — “Would you tell anyone?” — He hesitated.] “Only if it were someone you 
loved.”  (DOC) (=‘If I were you, I would tell someone only if it were someone I loved.’) (The ‘you’ in ‘Only 
if it were someone you loved’ results from a combination of the structure ‘I would only tell someone if it 
were someone I loved’, which is a response indicating a ‘surface’ interpretation of the question, and the 
communication ‘I would only advise you to tell [someone if it were] someone you loved’, which is a 
response to what is the underlying question, namely ‘Do you advise me to tell anyone?’.) 
 
 
b. 
[I only wanted to help. And I’m not at all sure if I would recognize her.] Perhaps if she dolled herself up in 
some decent outfit and ... and took that ring out of her nose.  (DOC) 
 
 
c. 
[“Another beer?”] — “Well, if you insist.”  (DOC) (One could also say that ‘If you insist’ has become 
conventionalized as an expression of [usually at least ostensibly politely reluctant] acceptance in response 
to an offer.) 
 
 
d. 
[“Does your dog bite?”] — “If you tease her.” 

 
238
In these examples, the P-clause is an independent sentence. This is not the case when the Q-clause is deleted 
after than: 
(771) 
a. 
[There is of course a special excitement about the first time with a new partner.] Her heart beats faster than 
if she were going to bed with Charles.  (NW) (=Her heart beats faster than it would beat if she were going 
to bed with Charles.) 
 
 
b. 
[Throughout the year the Metal Rabbit needs to work closely with others and take notice of their views. If 
he can do this,] he will find his progress considerably greater than if he were to try to set about his activities 
single-handed.  (COB-W) (=‘he will find his progress considerably greater than he would if he were to...’.) 
 
 
c. 
[In practical terms, a broken windscreen can mean that] driving the vehicle is even more difficult or 
dangerous for the driver than if he had suffered minor bodywork damage. [A fast repair service is therefore 
essential.]  (COB-W) (‘than if’=‘than it would be if’) 
 
11.7.2.2. Covert-Q conditionals of the purely case-specifying-P type 
 
The following illustrate this possibility: 
(772) 
a. 
[“Each of the attendants has a key to the wall-safe where we keep the keys to all the cabinets and drawers 
and so on.”] — “So, if he took a fancy to one of your shrunken heads?”  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
[I’m sure Lillian saw you take the snuff-box.] Suppose she went to the police? 
Such examples are interpreted in the same way as conditionals starting with what if. The speaker leaves it to the 
hearer to fill in the missing Q-clause. 
 
11.7.2.3. If only 
 
The Q-clause can also be covert after P-clauses introduced by if only and expressing a tentative (=not very 
hopeful) or counterfactual wish: 
(773) 
a. 
If only she would listen to me! 
 
 
b. 
If only I hadn’t told her! 
 
 
c. 
[I was a bank cashier and one dear old lady said to me: “Mr H, I don’t understand what it is all about 
<=going decimal> so I am going on holiday for three weeks. I am sure it will all be sorted out before I come 
back.”] If that were only true.  (COB-W)  (less usual than ‘If only that were true’) 
The similarity between wishes introduced by if only and real conditionals is illustrated by the following example, 
in which if only does not express a wish (as it does in independent clauses) but introduces the if-clause of a 
pattern 3 conditional (mixed with the Q-clause of a pattern 2 conditional): 
(774) 
If only we had been born clowns, nothing bad would happen to us except a few bruises and a smear of 
whitewash.  (OMIH) (The addition of ‘only’ to the counterfactual P-clause turns the latter into a kind of 
complaint.) 
It should also be noted that counterfactual wishes introduced by if only come in various versions, with very slight 
differences between them: 
(775) 
a. 
If {I’d / I had} only been there! 
 
 
b. 
If only I had been there! 
 
 
c. 
If only I’d been there! 
Version (775a) is the least common of the three, especially without contraction of had. We normally expect a 
continuation (e.g. ‘...I could have saved her’), though a continuation is not really inevitable. Versions (775b) and 
(775c) can more easily be used with the same meaning, and when had is contracted there does not need to be any 
continuation. In addition, (775c) (or a second-person equivalent) is used as a simple exclamation with the 
meaning ‘I wish {I / you} had been there’ and always the same covert Q-clause referring to a ‘potential good 
experience missed’: ‘it would have been great’ or ‘you would have loved it’, etc. (This is similar to You should 
have been there! or You should have seen his face!) 
 
11.7.2.4. Presupposition-evaluating Q-less P-clauses 
 
Sometimes a Q-less P-clause (often with a heavy accent on if) is used as a reply signalling doubt or reservation 
about the truth of a presupposition inherent in the statement to which the Q-less P-clause is a reply: 

 
239
(776) 
a. 
[“I will be happy when she comes.”] — “IF she comes.”  (‘When she comes’ presupposes that she will 
come.) 
 
 
b. 
[“Well, for a start, I wouldn’t mind knowing which of those newspapers McClure read first.”] — “If either.”  
(DOC) 
 
11.7.2.5. Q-less conditionals as indignant exclamations 
 
(777) 
a. 
[“I don’t know what they pay you. You’ve never told me.” — “Exackly! So you know fuck-all about it, 
right? Look at you! You go out for that bloody teacher and what’s ‘er rates, eh? Bloody slave-labour, that’s 
what you are. Four quid an hour? Less?] Christ, if you add up what she gets an hour—[all those ‘olidays 
and everything].”  (DOC) 
 
 
b. 
[“So I shall have to ask you where you were last Sunday, Sunday the twenty-eighth of August.” — “Hub! 
Last Sunday?” He turned to his wife. “Hear that, Bren? Not bloody difficult, that one, is it? You tell ‘em. 
You remember better ‘an I do. Bloody ‘ell!] If you reckon I ‘ad anything to do wi’ that—last Sunday?”  
(DOC) 
 
11.7.2.6. Q-less if-clauses used for weak manipulation 
 
Covert-Q conditionals introduced by if, suppose, supposing or what if may sometimes introduce covert-Q 
conditionals that have the perlocutionary force of “weak manipulation” (Givón 1995: 122), i.e. they express a 
very polite directive (request, offer, invitation) or suggestion:20 
(778) 
a. 
[“There is a gentleman there. But he’s not in at the minute.] If you want just a quick look inside?”  (DOC) 
(request) 
 
 
b. 
If the gentlemen would move to the smoking-room now?  (invitation) 
 
 
c. 
Suppose we left in half an hour.  (suggestion) 
 
 
d. 
[I’ve got to leave this morning;] so if you’ll make out my bill, please?  (RTM) 
 
 
e. 
If I might just have my little envelope?  (ADIMV) 
 
 
f. 
If you just go and sit and wait there, Miss ... ?  (DOC) 
Independent P-clauses used in such a manipulative way can make use of the same auxiliaries as interrogative 
sentences with the same functions, e.g. Will you...?, Might I...?, Could you...? 
 
11.7.2.7. If you say so 
 
A seventh type of Q-less P-clause is if you say so, signalling acquiescence as to the content of the addressee’s 
utterance, but often with a strong implication that the speaker has tacit reservations or is suppressing outright 
disagreement—see section 10.3.3.1: 
(779) 
a. 
[“We should leave now.”] — “If you say so.” 
 
 
b. 
[“She’ll be here by ten.”] — “If you say so.” 
 
 
c. 
[“Any bloody idiot can tell you what it’s like!”] — “If you say so, sir.”  (DOC) (strong implication of 
reservations) 
 
11.7.2.8. Q-less if-clauses as independent questions 
 
(780) 
If you have a lump sum to invest? [Please tick here opposite.]  (COB-W) 
In fact, the clause following the question can be considered to be the missing Q-clause. 
 
11.7.2.9. Exclamations of surprise 
 
As noted by Quirk et al. (1985: 842), “negative if-clauses, usually preceded by well or why, are used to express 
surprise: Well, if it isn’t the manager himself! [‘It is indeed the manager himself!], Why, if it isn’t Jill! [‘It is 
indeed Jill!].” These too are examples of conditionals with an (unrecoverable) covert Q-clause. 
 
11.7.2.10. Pseudo-Q conditionals 
                                              
20 An explanation of why independent P-clauses can be used this way is proposed by Ford (1997: 405). 

 
240
 
In this type, the overt Q-clause is only ostensibly the Q-clause of the ‘if P, Q’ conditional. In fact, it is interpreted 
as a subclause of reason modifying the real, covert, Q-clause. For example: 
(781) 
a. 
[Don’t worry.] If this girl won’t have you, there are plenty of others who will. 
 
 
b. 
If you are shot at, this bullet-proof jacket will protect you. 
In our typology, sentences (781a-b) would at first sight be analysed as purely case-specifying conditionals (in 
which there is no implicative link between P and Q). However, they are actually interpreted in terms of a missing 
Q-clause: 
(782) 
a. 
[Don’t worry.] If this girl won’t have you, you needn’t despair, because there are plenty of others who will. 
 
 
b. 
If you are shot at you won’t get hurt, as this bullet-proof jacket will protect you. 
In fact, many conditionals in which there does not seem to be a clear conditional relationship between the two 
overt clauses lend themselves to this kind of analysis. Examples are particularly frequent when the P-clause is 
introduced by even if: 
(783) 
[And I would like to say this on behalf of all happy housewives listening in—namely we feel sure you both have 
all the excellent qualities needed to keep your ship of marriage away from the rocks of disillusion. And also that] 
even if you do get fed up in a few years’ time you can always seek marriage guidance and advice from your 
fellow citizens.  (HOW) 
Unlike a prototypical implicative even if-conditional, this cannot be paraphrased as ‘You might expect that if you 
do get fed up [with marriage] in a few years’ time you could not seek marriage guidance and advice from your 
fellow citizens, but that expectation is wrong’—see section 14.1.1. However, all problems of analysis disappear 
once it is seen that (783) is interpreted as the quite normal implicative conditional (784): 
(784) 
Even if you do get fed up in a few years’ time, you can still save your marriage because you can always seek 
marriage guidance and advice from your fellow citizens. 
Similarly: 
(785) 
[Things at last seem to be looking up for the thousands of long-suffering State Building Society depositors.] Even 
if the present scheme falls through—which now seems unlikely—there is a City merchant bank now waiting 
quietly on the sidelines with an alternative scheme in its pocket.  (LOB) 
This is interpreted as 
(786) 
Even if the present scheme falls through—which now seems unlikely—there will still be hope for them because 
there is a City merchant bank now waiting quietly on the sidelines with an alternative scheme in its pocket. 
In both examples ‘even’ can be dropped, certainly if you have ‘still’ in the Q-clause. 
It was noted in section 9.2.8 that some seemingly incoherent conditionals can be analysed as direct 
inferentials with a pseudo-Q-clause: 
(787) 
Oh WELL, if she phoned me YESterday, I was in LONdon.  (=If she phoned me yesterday she {didn’t get / won’t 
have got} an answer because I was in London.) 
Such pseudo-Q inferentials should be distinguished from examples like the following: 
(788) 
If she called yesterday, I was out at the time.  (Dancygier 1998: 166) 
Here the overt Q-clause does express a conclusion, but the premise is to be found in a covert because-clause 
rather than in the if-clause: ‘If she called yesterday I was out at the time. I conclude this because I knew nothing 
of her having called’.) This is a second type of pseudo-Q inferential. The inference is not from (the overt) P to 
(the overt) Q (as in standard direct inferentials), nor from (the overt) P to a covert Q (as in [787]), but from a 
covert P (expressible in the form of a because-clause) to the overt Q. 
Pseudo-Q inferentials like (787) should also be distinguished from what Dancygier (1988b: 129) calls 
conditionals for which “we can postulate elliptical apodoses in which the surface q clauses are embedded.” What 
she means by this is that e.g. Comrie’s (1982) example If it rains tomorrow, we worked in vain yesterday can be 
analysed as derived from If it rains tomorrow, we’ll have to conclude that we worked in vain yesterday. This 
kind of analysis is not applicable to (787). 
 
11.8. Conditionals with a reduced P-clause or Q-clause 

 
241
 
11.8.1. Reduced-P conditionals 
 
Rather than being suppressed (ellipted, covert) altogether, P-clauses can also be elliptic. In that case only part of 
them is overt, while the rest is covert: 
(789) 
a. 
[If the property is put up for auction, any money collected will be used to pay taxes and then the first trust 
holder.] Money left over, if any, will be used to satisfy Sinclair’s claim.  (COB-W) (=‘if there is any’) 
 
 
b. 
[Count to ten!—that’s what Morse had once told him before getting on to any high horse; and then,] if 
necessary, count to twenty.  (DOC) (=if it is necessary) 
 
 
c. 
While people performing introductions will, of course, not do so unless reasonably sure that it will be 
agreeable to both sides, [still, the mere fact of having been formally introduced does not compel one to 
continue an uncongenial acquaintance, but to break it off too pointedly could be construed as rudeness 
towards the friend performing the introduction.] (LOB) 
 
 
d. 
[A later Soviet defector ... described how Penkovsky was executed: burned alive in an open coffin.] If true, 
this should dispose of lingering suspicions that Penkovsky was an agent provocateur or a double agent.  
(COB-W) 
 
 
e. 
If anyone, perhaps, shouldn’t she tell him?  (DOC) 
One subtype of reduced-P conditionals consists of conditionals in which the clause expressing the proposition [-
p] is reduced to not: 
(790) 
[Will you examine the lymph nodes?] If not, why?  (COB-W) 
Another subtype consists of conditionals whose P-clause is a nonfinite clause, viz. a supplementive participial 
clause:21 
(791) 
a. 
If using a child seat, position it in the middle rear seat, leaving the three-point belts free for other children.  
(COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
If held in Harmondsworth, they are under the control of security guards trained and recruited to guard 
money, not people; if scattered through the prison system, they are likely to be alone.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
[Section 16 of the Rent Act, 1957, provides that] no notice to quit in respect of such premises shall be valid 
unless given not less than four weeks before the date on which it is to take effect.  (LOB) 
If the participial P-clause is not understood as having the same subject as the Q-clause, we can speak of an 
‘unrelated’ or ‘dangling’ P-clause: 
(792) 
a. 
A couple of flashguns or ordinary domestic tungsten lamps are a handy alternative if setting up your shot in 
the evening.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[No visas are required.] Cholera inoculations are recommended for the Philippines, and malaria tablets if 
travelling to remote areas.  (COB-W) 
 
11.8.2. Reduced-Q conditionals 
 
There are cases in which it is not the P-clause but the Q-clause that is elliptic (reduced): 
(793) 
a. 
[She had just said there’d been this photo of a bare-breasted tourist in Torremolinos.] Been a bit of a 
problem if that second copper’d asked for the photo, though.  (DOC) (=it would have been...) 
 
 
b. 
[And thirty-four witnesses could testify to that.] Thirty-five, if you included the driver.  (DOC) 
 
 
c. 
“I wouldn’t <open my mouth>, Louie, not if I were you,” Gaffer advised. (LOB) 
 
 
d. 
[“Does your dog bite?”] — “Not unless you tease him.” 
 
 
e. 
[“Would you recommend that dentist?”] — “{Only if / not unless} you were my worst enemy.” 
A common type of example consists of questions in which all of the Q-clause is ellipted except for what and/or a 
conjunction: 
(794) 
a. 
[“He’ll come at 5.”] — “What if he comes earlier?” 
                                              
21 A supplementive clause is a clause with the following characteristics (see Declerck 1991b: 456-458): (a) It does not have a finite 
verb: it either has no verb at all or has a nonfinite verb (e.g. a participle); (b) It has no overt subject, but is interpreted as having the 
same subject as the main clause; (c) It is separated from the main clause by a break in intonation; (d) It is interpreted as having an 
adverbial meaning; unless introduced by a conjunction or preposition indicating otherwise, the unmarked interpretation is in terms 
of reason or cause. For example: Not knowing what to do, Bill came to me for advice. 

 
242
 
 
b. 
What if I won’t pay them?  (=What’ll happen if...) 
 
 
c. 
[“You will be shot if you don’t help him.”] — “And if I do help him?” 
 
 
d. 
What if his trousers fell off tonight and all the girls at the dance started shouting. (LOB) 
 
 
e. 
And if he doesn’t keep his mouth shut? 
 
 
f. 
[OK, the knife was stolen then]—but what if it wasn’t used? What if the murder was committed with a 
different knife?  (DOC) 
In some of these examples—e.g. (794a)—we might speak of an elliptic question, in which what can represent 
various Q-clauses (What shall we do?, How will we react?, etc.). But in other instances, such as (794f), what 
more or less just represents a question-mark, i.e. it can only be short for something like ‘what are the 
implications?’. Pragmatically, the sentence is used to suggest an alternative hypothesis. What seems to indicate 
that the speaker wonders what the implications of this hypothesis will be. 
Sometimes both the P-clause and the Q-clause are elliptic: 
(795) 
[He lost in the deal]—if not all then at least a lot.  (Pelç 1985: 65) (=If he didn’t lose all then at least he lost a 
lot.) (Pelç believes that the ‘if P, then Q’ relation is between ‘if not all then at least a lot’—which is supposedly 
P—and ‘he lost in the deal’—which is supposedly Q. As our ‘filled-out’ paraphrase makes clear, this is not our 
analysis.) 
 
11.9. Implicit-P conditionals 
 
In some syntactically marked conditionals the condition is not to be found in an ellipted (covert) or elliptic 
(reduced) P-clause but is implicit in one of the constituents of the sentence. One possibility is that it is expressed 
by an anaphoric pro-form like then,22 otherwise, in that case, or if so: 
(796) 
a. 
[I think we should go home now.] Otherwise it will be completely dark before we get home.  
(‘otherwise’=‘if we don’t go’) 
 
 
b. 
[“Perhaps we’d better surrender.”] — “What will happen to us {then / in that case}?” 
 
 
c. 
[Suppose you have lost your faith in Australia.] In that case you need to travel the world [so you can find a 
better country to live in.]  (COB-W) (resumptive ‘in that case’) 
 
 
d. 
[Four from a set of five?] But if so, the fifth was missing.  (DOC) 
With and without can also express an implicit condition: 
(797) 
I can read this text with my glasses, but not without them.  (=I can read this text if I’m wearing my glasses but 
not if I’m not wearing them.) 
A condition may also be implied in a restrictive relative clause: 
(798) 
[I do not answer any of their questions.] Anything I said would be used against me.  (Compare: ‘If I said 
anything it would be used against me’.) 
In most cases, the subject of the relative clause has nonspecific or generic reference: 
(799) 
a. 
A firm which did not invest its earnings would not survive very long. 
 
 
b. 
In those days, any man who spoke one or two foreign languages {would be / would have been} considered 
for a post in the Foreign Office, but the man who had completed the Grand Tour {would enjoy / would have 
enjoyed} a considerable advantage over those who had not. 
 
 
c. 
Any ordinary person who had ventured upon such an insult would have been overwhelmed with clamorous 
retort.  (Jespersen 1932: 126) 
 
 
d. 
Fancy your wife attached to a mother who dropped her h’s.  (Jespersen 1932: 116) 
In many cases a condition is implicit in a nominal constituent (more specifically, a noun phrase, pronoun, gerund 
clause or infinitive clause). 
(800) 
a. 
In my days a lady would not have married a stable-boy.  (=A lady would not have married a lad if that lad 
had been a stable-boy.) 
                                              
22 The Dutch equivalent of then, viz. dan, can also be used cataphorically (=announcing something to come), provided it is heavily 
accented (which triggers a specificational reading): 
 
(i) 
Ik zal het alleen DAN doen als jij me helpt. 
 
 
I will do it only THEN if you help me. 
 
 
‘I will do it only in the following case: if you help me.’ 

 
243
 
 
b. 
If a whisky will make you feel better, I’ll buy you one.  (=If you will feel better if you have a whisky...) (The 
overt P-clause is actually a full conditional with the P-clause hidden in ‘a whisky’. Since the rest of the 
clause is the Q-clause, the use of ‘will make’ is natural.) 
 
 
c. 
If this would be difficult for an average student to understand, it was quite impossible for Stephen.  (=If [it 
is the case that] it would be difficult for someone to understand this if he were an average student, then it 
was certainly impossible for Stephen.) (See also Funk 1985: 405.) 
 
 
d. 
I’d be glad to thwart him.  (=I’d be glad if I could thwart him.) 
 
 
e. 
That would be quite interesting, yes.  (=if that happened, etc.) 
 
 
f. 
Doing it with one’s own hands would be more satisfactory. 
 
 
g. 
Come and see me at five—if that will suit you.  (=‘if it will suit you if you come and see me at five’) 
 
 
h. 
If it will help you, I am willing to lend you £10.  (=If it will help you if I lend you £10, I am willing to lend 
you £10.) 
 
 
i. 
He would have been surprised to be told it.  (NW) 
 
 
j. 
I’d have given all my fortune to have prevented this, Donald.  (FORG) (=if I could have prevented this) 
 
 
k. 
Of course it would have been far more sensible and businesslike to have got Dr Ghopal’s name in the first 
place and to have written to him rather than make that romantic direct approach.  (LOD) 
 
 
l. 
[Margaret Daley rose and spoke to him, requesting a confessional hearing at one of the appropriate times. ... 
Father Richards took her gently by the arm and spoke quietly into her ear.] “If it will help, my child, come 
now! [Let Christ, through His cross and through His resurrection, set you free from all your sins!”]  (WTW) 
(=‘If it will help if you come now, come now.’) 
 
 
m. 
[And this was probably the reason why very few of the guests—none, so far as Sarah was aware—had 
ventured out into Oxford that afternoon, although (as she later told her interrogators)] it would have been 
perfectly possible for any of the guests to have gone out (or for others to have come in) without her noticing 
the fact.  (SOA) (=If any of the guests had gone out, it would have been possible for her not to notice it.) 
Note the possible combinations of verb forms in copular conditionals referring to the past where P takes the form 
of an infinitive clause functioning as subject: 
(801) 
a. 
To contradict him would have been to ask for trouble. 
 
 
b. 
To have contradicted him would have been to ask for trouble. 
 
 
c. 
To have contradicted him would have been to have asked for trouble. 
 
 
d. 
To contradict him would have been to have asked for trouble. 
Needless to say, extraposed subject clauses can very often be paraphrased as conditional clauses: 
(802) 
a. 
It would be very interesting to read that report. 
 
 
b. 
It would have been very interesting to {read / have read} that report. 
If the head clause uses the conditional perfect and the extraposed infinitive clause refers to the past or present, 
the perfect infinitive is generally preferred to the unmarked infinitive. Thus, the perfect infinitive is preferred in 
each of the following examples: 
(803) 
a. 
It would have been better not to {make / have made} that remark. 
 
 
b. 
It would have been better not to {make / have made} that remark {when we were at table / just now / right 
now}. 
 
 
c. 
[He was suddenly aware that] it would have been considerably quicker for him to have driven across the 
park instead of round the villages.  (WTW) 
 
 
d. 
[While he was waiting for her in the rain he realized that] it would have been much more comfortable for 
him to {be / have been} waiting in a sheltered place. [He decided that next time they made an appointment, 
it would be in a pub.] 
On the other hand, both infinitive forms are equally possible when the reference is to the future: 
(804) 
a. 
It would have been better to {make / have made} that remark tomorrow. 
 
 
b. 
It would have been better to {come / have come} tomorrow instead of today. 
Note, however, that there are constraints on the interpretability of such examples. Example (804a) is fine on the 
understanding that the remark has been made already and therefore won’t be made tomorrow. Sentence (804b) is 
grammatical, even if the visit hasn’t taken place, provided there is a plan to come today which is fixed, so that 
there is assumed to be no chance of coming tomorrow instead of today. Either way (visit over or not over, but 
plan fixed), the strong implication is that the option not to come today is not open. This is in keeping with the 
fact that (805a) is only acceptable on a fixed plan interpretation, as in (805b). (This accords with what we said 
about overt P-clauses in section 5.7.2: a pattern 3 conditional referring to the present—e.g. If your uncle had 

 
244
paid us a visit now, we would have been in trouble—is only interpretable on the assumption that there has been a 
visit by my uncle or that a future surprise visit has been arranged.) 
(805) 
a. 
It would have been better not to {make / have made} that remark tomorrow. 
 
 
b. 
[It turns out that] it would have been better not to {do / have done} Paris tomorrow, [since there’s going to 
be a big demonstration on, but we’ve got no choice now.] 
If there is no fixed plan interpretation, (805a) is unacceptable because of the combination of a negative infinitive 
clause and counterfactuality, which results in a positive ‘#P’-statement of the future as fact—’the remark {is / 
has been / was made} tomorrow’—which is pragmatically impossible. 
It should also be noted that the link between extraposed infinitive clauses and if-clauses is also clear from the 
fact (already referred to above) that extraposed if-clauses are often actually interchangeable with extraposed 
infinitive clauses: 
(806) 
a. 
It would make her anxious {to know / if she knew} about these problems. 
 
 
b. 
It is better {to disregard / if we disregard} her eccentric behaviour. 
If-clauses can be used similarly as if they were complement clauses. Compare: 
(807) 
a. 
Do you mind my smoking? 
 
 
b. 
(Do you) mind if I smoke? 
The only difference is that the former implies that the smoking is already in progress, whereas the latter at least 
strongly suggests that it is not. This difference is due to the fact that a gerund complement clause receives a kind 
of factive interpretation, unless it depends on a nonfactual head clause (such as Would you mind...?). This also 
appears from the following: 
(808) 
a. 
Do you mind my asking you all these questions? 
 
 
b. 
Do you mind if I ask you all these questions? 
Pragmatically, (808a) cannot normally be used prior to any questions being asked. With (808b) the situation is 
the reverse: it would be very odd to use it once the questions have started to be asked. This makes (808b) only 
really usable in a context in which the speaker is waving a questionnaire at the addressee prior to asking the 
questions on it. 
 
11.10. Implicit-Q conditionals 
 
As noted by Taylor (1997: 295-296), independent if-clauses “may be amplified by the addition of a tagged yes or 
no. The tagged item serves to explicitly fix the polarity of the if-clause”: 
(809) 
a. 
[“Would you like some tea?”] — “If you’ve got some, yes.” 
 
 
b. 
[“Are you going to sue her?”] — “If she pays for the damage, no.” 
Note that “no” is essential to the interpretation of (809b). This suggests that yes and no are actually pro-forms for 
Q-clauses, i.e. that Q is not overtly expressed but is implicit in a constituent of the conditional. This type of 
conditional must therefore be analysed as a kind of ‘implicit-Q conditional’. This analysis derives support from 
the fact that if yes and if no can under certain conditions substitute for if so and if not, respectively—see also 
Taylor (1997: 297): 
(810) 
I wonder if she has passed her exam. If yes, her father will give her a car; if no, she will get nothing. 
 
11.11. Semi-nominal-P conditionals 
 
Another type of syntactically marked conditional is that in which the P-clause has a semi-nominal function, i.e. it 
seems to have the syntactic function of conditional clause and (finite or nonfinite) noun clause at the same time. 
We can distinguish three subtypes: 
 
11.11.1. Extraposed-P conditionals 
 
These are conditionals in which the if-clause seems to be an extraposed noun clause (i.e. subject or object 
clause). They are illustrated by the following: 

 
245
(811) 
a. 
It doesn’t matter if you are poor. 
 
 
b. 
It would be a shame if she failed the test. 
 
 
c. 
I don’t like it if you talk about money. 
 
 
d. 
It would be nice if everybody minded their own business. 
 
 
e. 
It will make her anxious if she knows about this. 
 
 
f. 
It will also help if you can make new habits to break the old one of smoking.  (COB-W) 
 
 
g. 
I would appreciate it if you would locate the file for one of the gravediggers, [I don’t know his last name, 
but his first name is Jack. Will you?]  (COB-W) 
However, the following paraphrases make it clear that the if-clause still has a truly conditional meaning. (Notice 
that, in these paraphrases, it / that and the extraposed that-clause do not convey the presupposition of existence 
typical of definite noun phrases or the factive interpretation typical of ‘the fact that-clauses’: this is because their 
referent forms part of the theoretical world created by the P-clause.) 
(812) 
a. 
If you are poor, it does not matter that you are poor. 
 
 
b. 
If she failed the test, it would be a shame that she failed the test. 
 
 
c. 
If you talk about money, I don’t like it that you talk about money. 
 
 
d. 
If everybody minded their own business, the fact that everybody {minded / was minding} their own 
business would be nice. 
 
 
e. 
If she knows this, it will make her anxious that she knows it. 
 
 
f. 
If you can make new habits to break the old one of smoking, your making new habits will also help. 
 
 
g. 
If you would locate the file for one of the gravediggers, I would appreciate your doing that. 
For reasons of redundancy, these sentences are relatively unacceptable, but they become fully acceptable if the 
repeated clause is replaced by a resumptive (anaphoric) pronoun: 
(813) 
a. 
If you are poor, it does not matter. 
 
 
b. 
If she failed the test, that would be a shame. 
It should be noted, however, that the ‘paraphrases’ in (812) and (813) are only adduced here to prove that the P-
clauses in the originals in (811) have a conditional meaning. We do not claim that there is no difference in 
meaning and/or use between the ‘paraphrases’ and the originals. That there must be at least some difference is 
clear from the fact that a paraphrase like (813) does not always appear to be available: 
(814) 
a. 
It’d be an idea if we had the meeting at my house.  (COB-S) 
 
 
b. 
??If we had the meeting at my house, it’d be an idea. 
The difference in acceptability between these must be due to the different position of the P-clause, which is 
sentence-final in (814a) and sentence-initial in (814b). It is apparently more difficult to interpret it’d be an idea 
as it’d be a good (or interesting) idea if the P-clause is sentence-initial. However this may be, the explanation for 
this must be pragmatic rather than purely syntactic or semantic. 
A strong piece of evidence supporting the claim that ‘extraposed if-clauses’ are really conditional clauses, not 
noun clauses, is the fact that, like if-clauses of the canonical pattern 1, they must use the Present Perspective 
System (with the present tense expressing T-simultaneity) when the reference is to the post-present. Compare: 
(815) 
a. 
It will be a shame if she {fails / *will fail} the test.  (conditional ‘if’-clause) 
 
 
b. 
I wonder if she {will fail / *fails} the test next week.  (nominal ‘if’-clause) 
We conclude from the above observations that the if-clauses in (811a-g) are true conditional clauses, not noun 
clauses, and that (811a-g) are derived through deletion of an extraposed noun clause. Thus, the putative 
underlying structure of It would be nice if she came is ‘If she came it would be nice that she came’. Deletion of 
the redundant that-clause yields If she came it would be nice, from which we can derive It would be nice if she 
came by moving the if-clause into final position. 
This conclusion—that it is not the P-clause but a covert noun clause that is extraposed in (811a-h), in other 
words, that (811a-g) are derived from (812a-g)—accords with several further observations: 
(a) Examples similar to (811a-g) can be found in which the if-clause precedes the it-clause, in which case we 
cannot possibly claim that the P-clause is an extraposed clause: 
(816) 
a. 
If he said good morning to someone, it was a matter of guess-work, not recognition. 
 
 
b. 
If we leave that window open it just makes a draught. 
In these examples it can only be analysed as an anaphoric pronoun (referring back to the situation described in 
the if-clause). Other anaphoric pronouns, like that or this, can be used similarly: 

 
246
(817) 
a. 
If stocks stabilize, that’s always a disappointment.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
If a breakdown occurs this is televised in about 15 to 20 seconds.  (COB-W) 
(b) The claim that in (811a-g) we have extraposition of a covert noun clause rather than extraposition of the P-
clause itself accords with the fact that the following is ungrammatical: 
(818) 
*What does if she says that mean to you? 
If it were the P-clause itself that was extraposed, (818) should be grammatical, as it would represent the 
underlying structure of What does it mean to you if she says that?. 
(c) Extraposed clauses can come in couples, expressing alternative possibilities: 
(819) 
It’s no business of mine whether she cheats him or he cheats her.  (=The identity of the cheat is no business of 
mine.) (extraposed noun clauses) 
The same would seem to be possible in sentences like (811a-g): 
(820) 
It would be a shame if she got injured or (if she) otherwise did not make it to the final. 
At first sight, this might suggest that it is the if-clauses themselves that are extraposed. However, (820) is short 
for (821): 
(821) 
If she got injured or (if she) otherwise did not make it to the final, it would be a shame that she got injured or 
(that she otherwise) did not make it to the final. 
It should also be noted that the following example is different from (820), because its if-clauses are not 
conditional clauses but noun clauses (i.e. if=whether): 
(822) 
[“Well, go and sleep in the spare room, then—I’ve got to get some sleep.”] — “All the bloody same to me, 
innit—if I go in there, or if I stay in ‘ere.”  (DOC) (The extraposed ‘if’-clauses are subject clauses: the 
construction is a substandard version of ‘It is all the same to me whether I go in there or stay in here.’) 
To summarize this section, there is solid evidence that it is not the P-clause itself that is extraposed in sentences 
like It would be nice if you could do that, but rather the covert noun clause that you could do that. Still, for lack 
of a better term, we will refer to such conditionals as ‘extraposed-P conditionals’. This provides us with a handy 
label which not only does justice to the conditional meaning of the construction, but is also in keeping with its 
quasi-nominal function and its form (viz. the use of it as a dummy subject and the postpositioning of the P-
clause). Besides, the term is also in keeping with the fact that the deletion of the extraposed noun clause results 
in the P-clause being a necessary syntactic constituent of the sentence—otherwise the recoverability condition on 
the deletion would not be fulfilled—and with the fact that the P-clause adapts to the deletion of the noun clause. 
The latter observation is illustrated by (823a), whose putative underlying structure is (823b): 
(823) 
a. 
[He’ll certainly find school easier if he’s been to playgroup or nursery beforehand. If you have a choice,] 
it’s a good idea if the group is near the school, [so your child will meet some of the children he’ll be going 
to school with.]  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
... if there is a group near the school it’s a good idea to choose the group near the school ... 
In (823b) the definite noun phrase the group near the school belongs to the extraposed subject clause, not to the 
P-clause. With the subject clause gone in (823a), the definiteness of the noun phrase can only be signalled by the 
corresponding noun phrase in the P-clause. 
 
11.11.2. Nonextraposed-semi-nominal-P conditionals 
 
These differ from extraposed-P conditionals in that they do not involve a cataphoric or anaphoric it (or this / 
that). (We do not normally speak of extraposition when the rightward moving of a clause does not leave it or that 
as a ‘trace’ behind.) 
(824) 
a. 
Do you mind if I smoke?  (=If I smoke, do you mind my doing so?) 
 
 
b. 
If you need any help, just let me know.  (=If you need any help, just let me know that you need help.) 
 
 
c. 
I don’t care if you leave me.  (=If you leave me, I don’t care about your leaving me.) 
 
 
d. 
[“Would you rather be a bishop—or a paramount chief?” — “I don’t want to be either, really.”] — “I 
wouldn’t have minded if they’d made me a paramount chief.”  (DOC) (=I wouldn’t have minded their 
making me a paramount chief.) 

 
247
As in the case of extraposed P-clauses, the covert noun clause represent a necessary syntactic constituent of the 
sentence, viz. one of the arguments of the verb (in this case the direct object). The deletion of the noun clause 
renders the P-clause indispensable. (Otherwise the recoverability condition on the deletion would not be 
satisfied.) 
Apart from lacking a referring pronoun like it, nonextraposed-semi-nominal-P conditionals also differ from 
extraposed P-conditionals in that they are never inferential. 
A final note on nonextraposed-semi-nominal-P conditionals is that they should be distinguished from 
instances in which the if-clause is not a conditional clause but an interrogative subclause (so that if can be 
replaced by whether). Thus in the following example, the if-clause is a dependent question with a purely nominal 
function (viz. subject): 
(825) 
[Men must reconcile their feelings towards their fathers and learn to show emotion.] But if the best way to do this 
is by romping around a campfire and sniffing each other’s bottoms is open to question.  [adapted from COB-W] 
 
11.11.3. Specificational anacolutha 
 
We have seen (in section 11.2) that in spoken English a specificational conditional is often an ‘anacoluthon’. In 
such conditionals the if-clause may have a semi-nominal function. 
(826) 
The only reason I’d do that would be if it could save Mary from trouble. 
This sentence is a blending of The only reason I would do that would be that it could save Mary from trouble and 
I would only do that if it could save Mary from trouble. The semi-nominal function of the if-clause arises 
because of the first part of this blend. 
 
11.12. Split conditionals 
 
These are conditionals in which the P-clause and the Q-clause are syntactically independent of each other: 
(827) 
Suppose your wife cheated on you. How would you react? 
The following is a special case: 
(828) 
“What would you have done?” — “If I had been in your place, you mean?” 
This example is almost like a postscript-P conditional across turns. What is initially an independent Q-clause is 
brought into a syntactic relationship with a P-clause by the second speaker. The result is a sort of cooperatively 
achieved syntactic structure rather than a sequence consisting of a Q-clause and a P-clause which are truly 
independent of each other. 
 
11.13. Paratactic conditionals 
 
Paratactic conditionals are constructions that are interpreted as conditionals but in which the P-clause is 
coordinated with the Q-clause (rather than being syntactically subordinated to it). It is typical of them that they 
are nearly always interpreted as actualization conditionals, very seldom as inferentials. (The following 
exemplifies the latter possibility, which is only available with or as coordinator: He must be proud of your book, 
or why would he have given copies of it to all of his friends?) 
  On the basis of their syntactic form we can distinguish the following six types of paratactic conditionals. 
 
11.13.1. Paratactic conditionals with an imperative P-clause + or 
 
There are two further subtypes to be distinguished here: 
(a) The first subtype has the form ‘imperative + or + finite Q-clause’: Do it or I’ll punish you. This is equivalent 
to ‘Do it, otherwise I’ll punish you’, and is therefore pragmatically interchangeable with ‘If you don’t do it, I’ll 
punish you’ (=‘If [-p], then [+q]’). Both constituents can be negative: Don’t do that or you won’t get your pocket 
money (=‘If [+p], then [-q]’). 
In this type, the finite Q-clause (or-clause) must be assertoric (e.g. Keep this quiet or you may forget about 
your career). If it is interrogative in form, it has to be a rhetorical question: Don’t eat that cheese, or what will 

 
248
we put in your sandwiches tomorrow? (=‘If you eat that cheese we won’t have anything to put in your 
sandwiches tomorrow’). 
The finite or-clause usually refers to post-present actualization. In that case it is always interpreted as a threat 
or warning, not as a promise. (This implies that the or-clause must refer to an undesirable situation.) The 
reference to the post-present can be effected by either the future tense or the present tense: Keep this quiet or 
{you’ll put / you put} your job at risk. When the present tense is used, the sense of threat is stronger, because its 
fulfilment is guaranteed under the here-and-now of the speaker (see Huddleston [1979: 337]; Declerck [1991a: 
68]). When the finite or-clause does not refer to the post-present, the conditional does not express a threat but a 
general rule: 
(829) 
[Everybody observes the golden rule for an employee in this firm:] Don’t take too much initiative or you put your 
job at risk. 
(b) In the second subtype of paratactic conditional with an imperative(-like) P-clause + or, the Q-clause (=or-
clause) is not a finite clause but an imperative, or at least a form indistinguishable from an imperative: 
(830) 
a. 
Hand over your money or die! 
 
 
b. 
Open the window or be thought a coward.  (Lawler 1975: 375) (=threat) 
 
 
c. 
Publish or perish. 
This second subtype resembles the first in that it always expresses a warning or threat, because the Q-clause can 
only express something undesirable: 
(831) 
*Open that door or receive a handsome reward. 
Because the Q-clause of paratactic conditionals like (830a-c) always expresses something undesirable, its verb 
form (e.g. Die!) cannot be satisfactorily analysed as an imperative. In Fillmore’s (1986: 175) terms, the Q-verb is 
a “pseudo-imperative”. 
 
11.13.2. Paratactic conditionals with a (pseudo-)imperative + and 
 
Here again we can distinguish two subtypes, according to whether the and-clause is a finite clause or a clause 
with a (pseudo)-imperative. The former subtype is illustrated by the following: 
(831) 
Do that and I’ll punish you! 
Whereas Do that or I’ll punish you! is equivalent to ‘If you don’t do that, I’ll punish you!’, (831) means ‘If you 
do that, I’ll punish you’. Both sentences are interpreted as threats (or warnings). This shows that if a paratactic 
and/or-conditional expresses a threat, the polarity of the two clauses is reversed when or is used, but not when 
the conjunction is and. The following sentences further illustrate this: 
(832) 
a. 
Lock the door or I will kick you.  (interpreted as ‘if [-p], [+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
Lock the door and I will kick you.  (interpreted as ‘if [+p], [+q]’) 
(833) 
a. 
Don’t lock the door or I will kick you.  (interpreted as ‘if [+p], [+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
Don’t lock the door and I will kick you.  (interpreted as ‘if [-p], [+q]’) 
There are a couple of further generalizations to be made. Consider: 
(834) 
a. 
Open this door and you will die!  (=threat) 
 
 
b. 
Do that again and you can clear your desk!  (=threat) 
 
 
c. 
Open this door and you will enter Paradise!  (=promise) 
These examples show that when the finite and-clause refers to the post-present, it can express not only a threat 
(warning) but also a promise (guarantee). (In the previous section it was noted that a finite or-clause depending 
on an imperative P-clause and referring to the post-present can only express a threat or warning.) Whether the 
finite and-clause expresses a threat or a promise depends on whether the situation referred to is undesirable or 
desirable (respectively) to the hearer—see also Lawler (1975); Fillmore (1986: 174). The following examples 
further illustrate this: 
(835) 
a. 
Open this letter and I will never trust you again!  (threat) 
 
 
b. 
Help me carry these and I will give you a fiver.  (promise) 
In this respect paratactic and-conditionals are exactly like canonical pattern 1 conditionals—see Akatsuka (1991: 
33): 

 
249
(836) 
a. 
If you open this letter, I will never trust you again!  (threat) 
 
 
b. 
If you help me carry these, I will give you a fiver.  (promise) (Using ‘or’ here would represent being given 
a fiver as something undesirable.) 
Another major difference between the finite or-version and the finite and-version is the mood of the first clause. 
In Do that or I’ll punish you the P-clause is arguably in the imperative mood. (This appears, e.g. from the 
semantic incongruity of ??Be too independent or I’ll punish you, where the stative verb phrase be too 
independent has the same unacceptability that we associate with the combination of the imperative and a stative 
verb phrase, and from the fact that the first clause can use the emphatic negative form of an imperative: Don’t 
you do that or I’ll punish you.) In Clean up that mess and I’ll give you £5 the P-clause also appears to be in the 
imperative mood. However, in Do that and I’ll punish you, which expresses a threat rather than a promise, the P-
clause is a ‘pseudo-imperative’. In fact, it seems to be moodless (i.e. neither an imperative nor an indicative or 
subjunctive): do that is just a plain infinitive clause (i.e. a constituent with the verb stem) which names a 
particular situation. Treating it as an imperative seems incongruous, since Do that and I’ll punish you implies 
that the speaker does not want the hearer to do it: what is expressed is just the opposite of what is expressed by 
the imperative Do that in isolation. Moreover, there are examples in which the first clause cannot be 
(felicitously) used as an imperative in isolation: 
(837) 
a. 
Be too independent and your boss will feel that you’re undermining her authority. 
 
 
b. 
*Be too independent! 
Furthermore, the first clause of a paratactic and-conditional cannot be an emphatic negative imperative: *Don’t 
you do that and I’ll give you £5—see Lawler (1975: 372). 
Like finite or-clauses, finite and-clauses do not always refer to post-present actualization. They can also refer 
to a general or habitual situation that includes the temporal zero-point. Compare: 
(838) 
a. 
Keep this quiet or you put your job at risk.  (reference to future actualization; interpreted as an open-P 
conditional) 
 
 
b. 
Be too independent and you put your job at risk.  (interpreted as a neutral-P conditional referring to a 
generic or habitual situation) 
Because (838b) is not concerned with post-present actualization, it expresses neither a promise nor a threat. (In 
11.13.1 we reached the same conclusion in connection with finite or-clauses.) The following are similar 
examples: 
(839) 
a. 
Do just what you have to do and no more, and the manager is (always) happy. 
 
 
b. 
Have one off-day and they say you’re not up to the job any more. 
 
 
c. 
Ask her anything about her work and she thinks you’re laughing at her. 
As is underlined by the use of the nonassertive item anything in (839c), conditionals like these have the same 
meaning as open-P conditionals. 
Up to now all the examples of ‘(pseudo-)imperative + and’ given in section 11.13.2 have had a finite and-
clause. Similar conditionals with a pseudo-imperative and-clause often have a low degree of acceptability: 
(840) 
a. 
Open that door and {die / you will die}! 
 
 
b. 
Do that for me and {?receive £5 / I’ll give you £5}. 
 
 
c. 
Say that once more and {??die / you will die}. 
The following might seem to be an exception to this tendency: 
(841) 
Open this door and enter Paradise itself! 
However, this sentence is probably not interpreted as a conditional, i.e. as ‘If you open this door you will enter 
Paradise itself’. On its normal interpretation, the addressee is exhorted to open the door to Paradise and enter it. 
By contrast, the following illustrates a fully acceptable type of paratactic conditional with a pseudo-
imperative and-clause: 
(842) 
Buy a lottery ticket now and win £250,000. 
This kind of sentence is still special, though, in that it does not yield a genuine conditional meaning (‘If you buy 
a lottery ticket, you will win £250,000.’). That is, (842) does not promise or guarantee the actualization of the Q-
situation. It guarantees no more than the possibility of actualization of the Q-situation. However, what is merely 

 
250
possible seems to be represented as if it were certain. Using the form of (842) is a rhetorical trick (not 
uncommon to advertisements) to exaggerate the chances of winning £250,000. 
 
11.13.3. Paratactic conditionals with finite P-clause + finite and/or-clause 
 
A third type of paratactic conditional is that in which both clauses are finite clauses making a statement. Again, 
there are two subtypes. 
(a) The first subtype is illustrated by the following: 
(843) 
a. 
[The manager’s very short-tempered.] I make a tiny mistake and I get shouted at. 
 
 
b. 
[I seem to be at odds with the weather lately.] I’ll wear a raincoat and take an umbrella and I’ll spend all day 
carrying them in hot sunshine, then I’ll leave both at home and it’ll pour down as soon as I’m out. 
 
 
c. 
[The foreman there was horrible:] you made the slightest mistake and he jumped down your throat. 
 
 
d. 
[He’s very cantankerous.] I’ll offer him tea and he’ll demand coffee, I’ll cook the fish he wanted and he’ll 
say he wants chicken. [There’s no pleasing him.] 
This subtype of paratactic conditional always refers to a habit or expresses a general (timeless) truth.23 (For this 
reason, examples are particularly common with an indefinite subject like you as subject of the P-clause: You try 
to please someone and they think you want something from them—see also Bolinger [1977: 158].) The finite Q-
clause must be a statement, not a question. However, it may be a rhetorical question (which receives the 
interpretation of a statement): 
(844) 
[Do just what you have to do and no more, and the manager will be happy.] Show initiative, and will he thank 
you? [He’ll think you want his job.] 
It is also worth noting that if the P-clause is a negative statement, the coordinating conjunction to be used is no 
longer and but or. Compare: 
(845) 
a. 
[The manager’s very short-tempered.] I make a tiny mistake {and / *or} I get shouted at. 
 
 
b. 
[The manager’s very short-tempered.] I cannot make a tiny mistake {or / *and} I get shouted at. 
(b) The second subtype of paratactic conditional with two finite clauses is illustrated by the following: 
(846) 
a. 
(chemist pointing at a bottle on his shelf) You won’t drink this and live. 
 
 
b. 
(same context) [That’s an excellent medicine.] People will drink it and feel much better. 
This subtype differs from the first in several respects. Firstly, all examples make use of predictability will. 
Secondly, the second clause has to be reduced (e.g. *You won’t drink this and you won’t live). This is because 
will has wide scope over the entire conditional: ‘It is predictable that [you don’t continue to live if you drink 
this]’. Thirdly, the coordinating conjunction has to be and, even if the P-clause is negative. 
 
11.13.4. Paratactic conditionals with a quantified noun phrase as P-constituent 
 
A fourth type of paratactic conditional is that in which the P-constituent is a quantified noun phrase rather than a 
verb form: 
(847) 
a. 
Two more victories {and / *or} we’re sure of winning the title. 
 
 
b. 
One more step, {and / *or} you’re a dead man. 
 
 
c. 
One false move, {and / *or} prepare to meet your maker! 
 
 
d. 
Another hour {and / *or} we’re free. 
In such examples, the quantified expression indicates the distance between the actual state of affairs and the 
actualization of the theoretical Q-situation—see also Fillmore (1986: 169). The reason why or cannot be used, 
not even to express a threat, is that this construction expresses ‘if [+p], then Q’. As we have seen, paratactic 
conditionals with or can only be interpreted as ‘if [-p], then Q’. 
 
11.13.5. Paratactic conditionals of the form ‘NP or NP’ 
 
                                              
23 If will is used, it expresses typical (and hence predictable) behaviour. 

 
251
A fifth type of paratactic conditional is a construction in which two noun phrases—in fact, elliptic clauses—are 
linked by or, as in Your money or your life! Here the conditional interpretation results from the fact that the 
speaker is offering the hearer two alternatives, with the implicit instruction to choose the first of them. If the 
hearer does not do so, his refusal of the first alternative is a sufficient condition for the actualization of the 
second alternative. 
 
11.13.6. Asyndetic paratactic conditionals 
 
A sixth type of paratactic conditional is asyndetic (=without a conjunction), e.g. No work, no money / No money, 
no food. Such a ‘juxtaposition conditional’ may be interpreted as closed-P, open-P, or counterfactual-P, 
according to whether the assumption is that the habitual P-situation does not actualize, may not actualize in the 
future, or does actualize in the present: 
(848) 
a. 
[“I haven’t got anything to live on”.] — “Of course, no work, no money.”  (closed-P: ‘If you don’t work—
and you don’t—you don’t earn any money.’) 
 
 
b. 
[“So you’ll accept the job.” — “What else can I do?] No work, no money.  (open-P: ‘If I don’t work, I 
won’t earn any money’.) 
 
 
c. 
[Of course I work.] No work, no money.  (counterfactual-P: ‘If I didn’t work, I wouldn’t earn any money’.) 
In colloquial English, asyndetic paratactic clauses can sometimes be used similarly as if they formed a 
conditional sentence: 
(849) 
a. 
Just name your price, you’ll get it. 
 
 
b. 
Do that again, I’ll kick your teeth in.  (Bailey 1989: 278) 
 
 
c. 
You don’t study, you fail.  (Bailey 1989: 278) 
 
11.14. Specificational (focusing) conditional structures 
 
11.14.1. Definition 
 
A sentence or clause is specificational if it focuses a constituent and in doing so represents it as the value 
satisfying a presupposed variable—see Declerck (1983a, 1983b, 1984, 1988b). For example: 
(850) 
a. 
The one who did it was JOHN. 
 
 
b. 
JOHN was the one who did it. 
 
 
c. 
It was JOHN who did it. 
 
 
d. 
JOHN did it. 
These sentences all presuppose the existence of a variable ‘the x who did it’ and specify the value ‘John’ for it. 
In doing so they focus John (intonationally and/or structurally), which is therefore interpreted contrastively: 
‘John and no one else’. (Like other kinds of focusing, specificational focusing implies a set of alternatives which 
are excluded from the predication.) Because the Gricean Maxims of Quality and Quantity (part 1) require that all 
the values truly satisfying the variable should be specified, specificational sentences have an ‘exhaustiveness 
understanding’, i.e. they implicate that, unless indicated otherwise, the value(s) specified is / are the only one(s) 
satisfying the variable. The working of this implicature is further illustrated by the following: 
(851) 
a. 
It’s if it snows that she doesn’t dare to do her shopping herself.  (This is by implicature interpreted as ‘It’s 
only if it snows that she doesn’t dare...’.) 
 
 
b. 
One way of telling that is if the baby’s heart rate might start to drop.  (COB-S)  (Here the exhaustiveness 
implicature is blocked by the numeral ‘one’ in the description of the variable: ‘one way’ implies that there 
are other ways, so the way specified as value in the sentence does not represent the exhaustive list of 
possible ways.) 
In one-clause sentences a specificational reading can only be triggered by a marked contrastive accent, as in 
(850d). In some cases where the sentence makes a gnomic or general statement, the specificational focusing 
engenders a conditional reading: 
(852) 
a. 
The RICH will get away with this, the POOR won’t.  (Compare: You’ll get away with this if you are rich, not 
if you are poor.) 
 
 
b. 
BLOND people often have a white, freckled skin.  (Compare: It is if people are blond that they often have a 
white, freckled skin.) 

 
252
As far as two-clause conditionals are concerned, there are five possibilities of a specificational interpretation: (a) 
only the P-clause is specificational; (b) only the Q-clause is specificational; (c) the conditional as a whole is a 
specificational sentence with P introducing the variable and Q specifying the value; (d) the conditional is a 
specificational sentence in which the Q-clause defines the variable and the value specified for it is the condition 
P, which is expressed in a nonspecificational P-clause; (e) the conditional is a specificational sentence in which 
the variable is defined by the Q-clause and the value specified for it is expressed by a P-clause which is 
specificational too. These five types are discussed in sections 11.14.2 through 11.14.6 below. 
 
11.14.2. Type 1: specificational P-clause 
 
In this case only the P-clause is specificational: it contains a focused constituent which is presented as the value 
of a specificational reading. 
(853) 
a. 
If it wasn’t OSWALD who murdered Kennedy, who did?  (inferential) 
 
 
b. 
If OSWALD didn’t murder Kennedy, who did?  (inferential) 
 
 
c. 
I’ll only do it if it’ll be JILL who helps me.  (actualization conditional) 
 
 
d. 
If it was JOHN that you were thinking of asking, he’s useless.  (relevance conditional) 
 
 
e. 
[If you put the phone down straight away,] it doesn’t cut them off if it is they who have rung you.  [adapted 
from COB-S] (purely case-specifying-P conditional) 
Specificational P-clauses are concerned with truth but differ from premise-expressing ones (i.e. the P-clauses of 
inferential conditionals) in that they do not function as the premise of an inferential reasoning process. Rather, 
they reveal the speaker’s concern with the truth of the P-clause as the expression of a specificational speech act 
(i.e. the illocutionary act of specifying a value for a presupposed variable). This distinguishes (854a), which is 
inferential, from (854b-c): 
(854) 
a. 
If John didn’t open the door, we won’t be able to enter the building. 
 
 
b. 
If JOHN didn’t open the door, it must have been either Bill or Peter. 
 
 
c. 
If John didn’t OPEN the door, what did he use that key for? 
In (854a), the if-clause (which has its nuclear accent on door, i.e. a default accent) makes a (neutral, open or 
closed) assumption about the truth of a proposition concerning the past actualization of the situation of John 
opening the door; in (854b), by contrast, the if-clause, in which there is a strong nuclear accent on John, makes a 
(neutral, open or closed) assumption about the truth of ‘John’ being the value satisfying the variable ‘the x who 
opened the door’. (The existence of this variable is presupposed, hence the actualization of the situation is 
presupposed too.) Similarly, the strongly marked accent on open in (854c) assigns contrastive focus to the verb, 
i.e. the question is whether ‘open’ is the value satisfying the variable ‘the x that John did in connection with the 
door’. 
Note that if the P-clause has the form of a full it-cleft, more than one tense combination is possible. The 
following are examples with post-present time reference—see Declerck & Depraetere (1995): 
(855) 
a. 
Could he find out that it will be his car that is used for the test tomorrow? 
 
 
b. 
Could he find out that it is his car that will be used for the test tomorrow? 
 
 
c. 
Could he find out that it will be his car that will be used for the test tomorrow? 
Similarly, with reference to the past: 
(856) 
a. 
Could you have borne it if it had been your child who was killed? 
 
 
b. 
Could you have borne it if it was your child who had been killed? 
 
 
c. 
Could you have borne it if it had been your child who had been killed? 
 
11.14.3. Type 2: specificational Q-clause 
 
In this type only the Q-clause is specificational: it contains a focused constituent which is presented as the value 
of a specificational reading: 
(857) 
a. 
If it rains, it will be JOHN who drives us.  (=If it rains, the x who will drive us is: John) 
 
 
b. 
If it rains, JOHN will be the one to drive us. 
 
 
c. 
If it rains, JOHN will drive us. 
 
11.14.4. Type 3: ‘premodified reduced it-clefts’ and variants 

 
253
 
In this type the conditional as a whole is specificational (i.e. the variable and value constituents are distributed 
over the two clauses): the Q-clause specifies a value for a variable which is introduced by the P-clause: 
(858) 
a. 
If anybody needs the publicity, it’s him, not us.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
If history’s taught us one thing, it’s surely that spoken word concerts solve nothing.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
No. If she were going to pray for anything, it would be for something that was of far greater importance.  
(DOC) 
 
 
d. 
If any pupil was likely to drive his teacher to retirement, to resignation, even to suicide, that pupil was 
Kevin Costyn.  (DOC) 
 
 
e. 
If anyone should have foreseen it, I should.  (COB-W) 
In Declerck & Seki (1990), the type exemplified by (858a-c) is called a “premodified reduced it-cleft”. It is 
typical of it that the if-clause calls up the idea of a variable (which ranks high, or highest, on a particular scale) 
and that the Q-clause specifies what the speaker sees as the only true, or at least the most suitable, value for that 
variable. The Q-clause has the form of a reduced it-cleft, i.e. a cleft whose wh-clause is deleted because it would 
only repeat the contents of the if-clause. Thus, If anyone can do it, it’s you (which is interpreted as ‘If there is 
one x who can do it, that x is you’) is short for If anyone can do it, it’s you who can do it. Because the variable is 
introduced in an open P-clause, such a conditional suggests a slight sense of uncertainty about the existence of 
the variable (i.e. there is an implication of possible nonfulfilment of the supposition). This is in keeping with the 
typical use of nonassertive forms (anybody, any, anything) in the if-clause. However, the if-clause of a 
premodified reduced it-cleft can also be closed-P, as in If (as I believe) there is someone who can do it, it’s you. 
The reason for introducing the variable of a specificational structure in the form of an if-clause is that this 
increases textual coherence. According to Haiman (1978), preposed if-clause are topics (themes). Though this is 
probably an overgeneralization, it does seem to be correct where premodified reduced it-clefts are concerned. 
Now, as is well-known, a topic usually represents old information, and it is by definition the case that the 
variable of a specificational sentence represents old—in fact even given—information. ‘Premodifying’ P-clauses 
are therefore a device for heightening textual coherence: they link up with the preceding context by resuming 
something that has already been said or implied. We therefore classify such P-clauses as ‘anchoring’ P-clauses—
see section 10.1.2. 
In some cases the variable is difficult to paraphrase, because it is not expressed in the form of a noun phrase 
in the P-clause: 
(859) 
a. 
If I didn’t hear the bell, it was because of the noise.  (=The x because of which I didn’t hear the bell was the 
noise.) 
 
 
b. 
If Arsenal improved after that it was because their diagonal passing was getting better.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
If there’s anything more ironic than a bunch of trad-rooted Irish musicians singing This is the modern 
world, it’s when they’re doing it in a voice that sounds like Joe Strummer’s.  (COB-W) 
Sometimes the premodified it-cleft is not reduced but contains a verbal pro-form. In that case, the two clauses of 
the cleft may allow more than one tense combination: 
(860) 
a. 
If anybody offers us a lift, it will be John who does so. 
 
 
b. 
If anybody offers us a lift, it is John who will do so. 
 
 
c. 
If anybody offers us a lift, it will be John who will do so. 
Similarly: 
(861) 
a. 
If they had gone anywhere, it is to the seaside that they would have gone. 
 
 
b. 
If they had gone anywhere, it was to the seaside that they would have gone. 
 
 
c. 
If they had gone anywhere, it would be to the seaside that they would have gone. 
 
 
d. 
If they had gone anywhere, it would have been to the seaside that they went. 
 
 
e. 
If they had gone anywhere, it would have been to the seaside that they would have gone. 
As is clear from the examples, the P-clause may refer to various kinds of possible worlds: 
(862) 
a. 
If I didn’t hear the bell, it was because of the noise.  (factual-P) 
 
 
b. 
If people have a problem with their children, it may be because they don’t give them sufficient attention.  
(neutral-P) 
 
 
c. 
If he isn’t happy—and he obviously isn’t—it’s because of his marriage, surely.  (closed-P) 
 
 
d. 
If anyone comes to meet us at the station, it will be Mother.  (open-P) 

 
254
 
 
e. 
[I don’t know if anything can be done, but] if anyone could help you it would be Jill. [Why don’t you get in 
touch with her?]  (tentative-P) 
 
 
f. 
If anyone had been able to help you out of your problems, it would have been me. [Why didn’t you tell me 
anything?]  (counterfactual-P) 
A final point worth making in connection with this type of specificational conditional is that there is a special 
subtype which Declerck (1992) calls the “inferential it is that-construction”: 
(863) 
a. 
(context: character B appears to have divulged something which should have been kept secret)  “What 
happened, sir? Were you...?” — “Was I what?” — “I just wondered what... whether it was that you’d...” — 
“That I’d what?” — “...drunk too much at the time, sir.”  (SIMP) 
 
 
b. 
[Not that Uther was ever unkind to me;] it was simply that he had no particular interest in a girl child.  
(Delahunty 1990: 11) 
 
 
c. 
[We’ve chosen good colours, gentle colours. Does that mean we’re gentle, you reckon? ...] It’s that there’s 
so much suffering in the world that I suddenly need other kinds of knowledge, to soothe it all out. [... These 
colours soothe me, the touch of velvet, those paintings.]  (WESK) 
 
 
d. 
“[You don’t find many girls like that.” — “That, sir, depends on where you look.” — “What do you mean?” 
— “Perhaps I’m speaking out of turn.” — “What were you going to say?” — “Nothing, sir.] It’s just that, 
had you said certain things to me before, which you’re saying now, I think I might have been able to be of 
some assistance in sparing you a certain amount of inconvenience.”  (MAUG) 
In (863a) the that-clause expresses a possible explanation of the fact that speaker B has inadvertently divulged a 
secret; in (863b) it expresses a possible interpretation of (and reason for) Uther’s behaviour; in (863c) it gives the 
reason for the choice of particular colours. Example (863d), finally, is slightly different: here the that-clause does 
not offer an interpretation or explanation of a situation referred to in the preceding context but an explanation for 
the act of speaking itself: it makes clear why the second speaker deems it necessary to voice her opinion to the 
first. 
Declerck (1992) calls this it is that-construction ‘inferential’ because it always expresses what the speaker 
thinks to be the correct explanation or interpretation of something that has happened or has been said, or of the 
fact that a speech act has taken place.24 (Self-evidently, this applies only to it is that-sentences that are 
affirmative statements; in negative it is that-sentences an interpretation or explanation is denied, whereas in 
interrogative ones the speaker seeks a confirmation of his inference from the hearer.) 
What is interesting for our purpose is that the variable for which the reduced cleft it is that...[that...] specifies 
the (overt) that-clause as value can be introduced by an if-clause: 
(864) 
a. 
If there has been an explosion, it’s that the workers have not taken the necessary precautions. 
 
 
b. 
If she hasn’t told you anything about it, it’s either that she doesn’t trust you or that she doesn’t know about 
it herself. 
As argued by Declerck (1992), (864a) is short for something like 
(865) 
*If there has been an explosion, it’s that the workers have not taken the necessary precautions that is the cause of 
the explosion. 
In other words, an inferential it is that-sentence is another subtype of ‘reduced it-cleft’. It differs from the other 
subtype only in that the value specified for the variable is a that-clause rather than a noun phrase, prepositional 
phrase or adverbial. 
It should also be noted that the structure ‘if-clause + reduced cleft’ is not inferential in the sense that an 
inference is made from P to Q. ‘Inferential reduced it-clefts’ are therefore not a subclass of ‘inferential 
conditionals’. 
Another characteristic of premodified reduced it-clefts is that the variable expressed in the deleted that-clause 
(and possibly introduced by a premodifying if-clause) is automatically taken from the group ‘reason / cause / 
explanation / interpretation’. It is in keeping with this that if an it is that-sentence is used in a context in which 
the variable is lexicalized overtly as a question-word (rather than being merely inferrable), the wh-word in 
question can only be why: 
(866) 
a. 
“I wonder why he did it.” — “Perhaps it’s that he needs money.” 
                                              
24 It is rather exceptional for the it is that-sentence to offer an explanation for making an illocutionary act, but the possibility is there, 
and the following is a good example: 
 
(i) 
[“Are you hungry?” — “No.”] — “It’s that there’s plenty of food in the fridge, if you should feel hungry.” 

 
255
 
 
b. 
“I wonder when / where he did it.” — “*Perhaps it’s that it was night / outside.” (Compare: Perhaps it was 
night / outside.) 
 
 
c. 
“I wonder who did it.” — “*Perhaps it’s that it was John.” 
 
 
d. 
“I wonder how he did it.” — “*Perhaps it’s that it was with a chisel.” 
Of these question-answer pairs only (866a) forms a coherent scrap of conversation. (This does not mean that 
reason or cause is strictly the only idea that inferential it is that-clauses can express. There are other ideas, which 
also have to do with interpretation or explanation but for which there is not a suitable question-word to lexicalize 
the variable. For example: 
(867) 
[“I wish, I wish she hadn’t met Arnold.” — “You’re very attached to Arnold, aren’t you?” — “Yes.”] — “It’s not 
just that you care what he thinks?” — [“No.”]  (Delahunty 1990: 19) 
Here the it is that-sentence interprets the hearer’s attitude towards Arnold, i.e. it offers a value for a variable 
which is paraphrasable as ‘the nature of your feelings for Arnold’. 
 
11.14.5. Type 4: Q-variable + nonspecificational P-value 
 
In this subtype of specificational conditional the variable is defined in the Q-clause and the value specified for it 
is the condition P, which is expressed in a nonspecificational P-clause. Because of the exhaustiveness 
understanding, which can be made explicit by the use of only if, P is then interpreted as the only condition 
satisfying the variable, hence as a necessary condition. 
(868) 
a. 
Only if it is particularly fine weather do we have a walk after dinner.  (=‘The only case in which we have a 
walk after dinner is: if it is particularly fine weather.’) 
 
 
b. 
It is only if it is particularly fine weather that we have a walk after dinner.  (id.) 
 
 
c. 
The only case in which I would not back you up {would be / is} if you did something illegal. 
In the following example, the exhaustiveness understanding is blocked by the presence of ‘one’—see 11.14.1: 
(869) 
One way of telling that is if the baby’s heart rate might start to drop.  (COB-S) 
One common means of suggesting that P is the value of a specificational conditional is to give end-position to 
the P-clause, because P then receives the end-focus that is preferably given to the constituent representing the 
new information. Thus, under neutral sentence intonation, I’ll do it if she agrees more easily suggests ‘not 
otherwise’ (i.e. the idea that P is a necessary condition) than If she agrees, I’ll do it does. This also explains why 
(870a) is much more natural than (870b): 
(870) 
a. 
“On what condition do you agree?” — “I accept your proposal if you pay me £500.” 
 
 
b. 
“On what condition do you agree?” — “If you pay me £500 I accept your proposal.” 
This claim about post-positioning is in keeping with Bolinger’s theory of “linear modification”. Bolinger (1965) 
observes that whether an element appears earlier or later in a sentence usually has important consequences for 
the semantics of the sentence. According to him, the reason is that “elements as they are added one by one to 
form a sentence progressively limit the semantic range of all that has preceded. This causes beginning elements 
to have a wider semantic range than elements toward the end.” (p. 279). Thus, “before the speaker begins, the 
possibilities of what he will communicate are practically infinite. ... When the first word appears, the possibilities 
are vastly reduced, but that first word has, in communicative value for the hearer, its fullest possible semantic 
range. The second word follows, narrowing the range, the third comes to narrow it still further, and finally the 
end is reached, at which point the sentence presumably focuses on an event—usually aided by a gesture, a 
physical context in which only one of several possibilities can be elected, or what not.” (p. 281) According to 
Bolinger, this theory predicts that constituents that are to imply “selective contrast” will preferably be put as far 
back in the sentence as possible, for the idea of contrast is heightened as semantic narrowing proceeds. For 
example, we will use (871a) rather than (871b) if we wish to establish a contrast between ‘open’ and ‘closed’. 
But if we wish to see the door contrasting with other objects, we will prefer (871b) to (871a): 
(871) 
a. 
I pushed the door open. 
 
 
b. 
I pushed open the door. (p. 291) 
Similarly, when we compare (872a) with (872b)—both uttered with neutral sentence intonation—we notice that 
only the latter “lends itself to the implication ‘but not before’—selective contrast” (p. 289): 
(872) 
a. 
When you come I’ll help you. 

 
256
 
 
b. 
I’ll help you when you come. 
Bolinger adduces a great many other illustrations, all of which he claims corroborate his principle of linear 
modification. It is interesting to see that some of these examples are also good illustrations of the ‘variable-
before-value’ principle that is discussed in Declerck (1988b: 243-251). For example: 
(873) 
a. 
If you come I’ll help you. 
 
 
b. 
I’ll help you if you come. 
Bolinger notes that of these two sentences “the first envisages more affirmatively the possibility of the person’s 
coming—has, that is to say, a meaning that goes a little beyond mere condition and may amount almost to an 
invitation; the second lends itself more readily to the implication ‘I’ll help you ONLY if you come’—selective 
contrast. When the if-clause is placed first, it serves as a frame for all that follows.” (p. 289). Bolinger’s 
observation that only (873b) readily suggests ‘only if you come’ accords with our claim that (when used out of 
context and without contrastive accent) only (873b) yields the specificational interpretation ‘I’ll help you in the 
following case: if you come’. The idea of ‘selective contrast’ then automatically follows from this reading (since 
a specificational reading is always contrastive—see Declerck [1988b: 24-28]), and the same thing is true of the 
idea ‘only if’ which follows from the exhaustiveness implicature that is typical of specificational sentences 
(Declerck 1988b: 28-36).25 
It should be noted, finally, that the possibility of P being the value constituent of a specificational conditional 
is only available in case-specifying conditionals, not in rhetorical ones. Compare: 
(874) 
a. 
If you want to hear the main news, Tom and Gilda are going to get divorced.  (relevance-expressing-P) 
 
 
b. 
*It is if you want to hear the main news that Tom and Gilda are going to get divorced. 
 
11.14.6. Type 5: Q-variable + specificational P-value 
 
In this type the conditional is a specificational sentence in which the variable is defined by the Q-clause and the 
value specified for it is expressed by a P-clause which is specificational too. As usual, the focussing of the value 
in the P-clause can be effected intonationally (by putting an extra heavy accent on a constituent of the if-clause) 
and/or structurally (by using a special structure, such as an it-cleft): 
(875) 
a. 
It is only if it wasn’t Oswald who killed Kennedy that someone else must have done it.  (inferential) (The P-
clause functioning as value constituent of the specificational conditional is itself a specificational clause 
with ‘Oswald’ as value constituent.) 
 
 
b. 
It is only if OSWALD didn’t kill Kennedy that someone else must have done it.  (id.) 
 
 
c. 
It is if GRANNY comes that we don’t have a walk after dinner.  (=‘The only case in which we don’t have a 
walk after dinner is: if GRANNY [rather than anybody else] comes.’) 
 
 
d. 
[“You’ll be happy if Julie comes.” — “No.] I’ll be happy if her SISTER comes.”  (actualization conditional) 
(=‘The case x in which I will be happy is: if it is her sister who comes.’) 
 
 
e. 
I will give it to you if your WIFE needs it. 
The latter example can be read as ‘I will give it to you only if it is your wife (rather than yourself or someone 
else) who needs it.’ In this reading the conditional is a specificational conditional with a specificational P-clause. 
The P-clause specifies the value ‘your wife’ for the presupposed variable ‘the x who needs it’. The conditional as 
a whole specifies ‘if the x who needs it is your wife’ as the value satisfying the variable ‘the condition x which is 
a prerequisite for my giving it to you’. In this reading, the variable is introduced by Q, the value specified for it is 
P. 
Type 5 differs from type 4 in that the P-clause may be relevance-expressing, but then only in a special use 
which violates (or exploits) the Gricean Maxim of Quality: 
(876) 
a. 
[“I’m hungry. Is there any apple pie in the fridge?”] — “If your GIRL-FRIEND is hungry, there is apple pie in 
the fridge.” 
                                              
25 Bolinger’s principle of linear modification (semantic narrowing) accords perfectly with the Functional Sentence Perspective theory 
of the Prague school. According to Firbas (1964), whether an expression is “thematic” or “rhematic” depends on its degree of 
“communicative dynamism” (=CD): thematic elements show a low degree of CD, whereas a high degree of CD is typical of 
rhematic elements. “It is obvious that elements conveying new, unknown information show higher degrees of CD than elements 
conveying known information.” (Firbas 1964: 270) One of the factors determining the degree of CD is “the capability of the 
sentence positions of gradually raising the degrees of CD, in the direction from the beginning towards the end of the sentence.” 

 
257
 
 
b. 
[“Why can’t I have any apple pie? You said there was some in the fridge if we were hungry. “] — “It’s if 
your GIRL-FRIEND is hungry that there is apple pie in the fridge.” 
By placing a marked (contrastive) accent on girl-friend in (876a) and by clefting the sentence in (876b), speaker 
B makes it clear that she wants the sentence to be interpreted specificationally: the intended reading is something 
like ‘There is apple pie in the fridge, but it is not for you. I want it eaten by your girl-friend only’. This is in fact 
a combination of two specificational readings: the P-clause has the specificational reading ‘if it is your girl-
friend (not yourself) who is hungry’, and is itself presented as the value satisfying the variable ‘the only case in 
which it is relevant for me to say that there is apple pie in the fridge’. 
As a final illustration of (non)specificational readings, consider the following set-restricting P-conditionals: 
(877) 
“Cats are stupid if they have grey eyes.” — “Just the contrary: cats are CLEVER if they have grey eyes.” 
If pronounced with unmarked sentence intonation, the first sentence can be read as nonspecificational. In that 
case the sentence just says that grey-eyed cats are stupid; no claim is made about other cats. By contrast, the 
reply, which shows a marked accent on clever, means something like ‘It is clever, not stupid, that grey-eyed cats 
are.’ This is a specificational reading: ‘clever’ is the value satisfying the variable ‘the x that grey-eyed cats are’. 
On this reading the variable is defined by the constituent cats from the Q-clause plus the set-restriction effected 
by the P-clause. 
When used in isolation, Cats are stupid if they have grey eyes can also be pronounced with extra emphasis on 
the P-clause. In that case it is read as: ‘Cats are stupid in the following case: if they have grey eyes.’ This is a 
specificational reading, in which Q represents the variable and P the value (=type 4—see 11.14.5). This 
interpretation suggests that P is a necessary condition, i.e. it implicates that cats are stupid if and only if they 
have grey eyes—see section 12.4.2. 
 
11.15. Conclusion 
 
In this chapter we have examined a number of conditional structures that do not have either of the unmarked 
structures ‘If P, (then) Q’ or ‘Q if P’. The conditional structures in question are ‘postscript-P conditionals’ (I’ll 
come tonight—if you will be at home), ‘conditional anacolutha’ (The one case in which I would help her would 
be if she was in mortal danger), ‘Nominal-Q conditionals’ (Imagine her embarrassment if you tell her off in front 
of her pupils!), ‘displaced-P conditionals’ (If we had small children I doubt if we should ever go abroad), 
‘stacked-P conditionals’ (If Jill would slap the director’s face if he told her off, (then) she’s not really an ideal 
public relations officer / If Jill has slapped the director’s face, (then) if the director insisted she could be fired), 
conditionals with coordinated P-clauses or Q-clauses, several types of ‘covert-P conditionals’ (e.g. I’ll smack 
you!) and ‘covert-Q conditionals’ (e.g. If the gentlemen would move to the smoking-room now?), conditionals 
with a reduced P-clause (I’ll do it if necessary) or with a reduced Q-clause (What if he isn’t at home?), ‘implicit-
P conditionals’ (I’ll lend you a fiver, if that’ll help), ‘implicit-Q conditionals’ ([‘Would you like some tea?’] — 
‘If you’ve got some, yes.’), ‘extraposed-P conditionals’ (It doesn’t matter if she is angry), ‘nonextraposed semi-
nominal-P conditionals’ (I wouldn’t mind if he were here), ‘split conditionals’ (Suppose your wife cheated on 
you. How would you react?), six types of paratactic conditionals (some with and or or, others asyndetic) and five 
types of specificational conditional structures.

Chapter 12 
 
Sufficient and/or necessary conditions 
 
 
 
12.1. Preliminaries 
 
In the (especially philosophically-oriented) literature a lot has been written about P being or not being a 
sufficient and/or necessary condition for Q. This discussion has been inspired by the question of what determines 
the truth of a conditional, and by the observation that at least some of the truth conditions of a conditional in 
everyday use are not those that are predicted by the principles of predicate logic: some conditionals that are 
logically true are apprehended as false by ordinary language users, or vice versa. 
In this chapter we will not be concerned with the question: ‘under which conditions is P logically sufficient 
and/or necessary for Q to be true or false or for the conditional as a whole to be true or false?’ (This question has 
been extensively discussed by philosophers and logicians.) It is our purpose to concentrate on the other senses in 
which P can be said to be or not to be a sufficient and/or necessary condition for Q. 
P can be a condition for Q in four different senses: 
(a) The actualization of the P-situation is a condition for the actualization of the Q-situation. 
(b) The truth of P is a condition for the truth of Q. 
(c) The speaker’s belief in the truth of P is a condition in the (weak) sense that it induces her to utter the Q-
clause or is a condition for the relevance of uttering Q. 
(d) The presence of the P-clause is a condition for the interpretability of the Q-clause (and hence of the 
conditional as a whole) and for the integrity (completeness) of the conditional as an independent syntactic 
structure. 
An example in which necessity has to do with sense (d) is If he has a dog, he will look after it well. From a 
syntactic-semantic point of view, the use of anaphoric it in the Q-clause of this sentence requires an antecedent 
noun phrase; from a semantic-pragmatic point of view, the use of it requires a means of identifying the referent 
of the pronoun. Taken by itself, the sentence provides, as the only means of identifying the referent of the 
pronoun, the antecedent noun phrase a dog. Since this noun phrase forms part of the P-clause, this P-clause is 
necessary both for a good understanding of what the definite pronoun it refers to (i.e. for the interpretability of 
the Q-clause) and for the syntactic completeness of the conditional structure, in which one clause contains the 
anaphoric pronoun and the other the antecedent. If used on its own, he will look after it well raises questions like 
‘when?’, ‘if what?’, etc., as well as the question ‘what do you mean by it?’. 
In what follows, we will make a careful distinction between these four senses, especially between (a)-(c) on 
the one hand and (d) on the other. The distinction between (a), (b) and (c) depends on the kind of conditional, 
viz. whether P is a condition for the actualization of the Q-situation, for the truth of the Q-proposition, or for the 
speech act of uttering the Q-clause. Sense (d) is about the necessity of the P-clause for the interpretability of the 
Q-clause, i.e. about whether or not the Q-clause is syntactically and semantically complete and self-sufficient 
enough to be fully interpretable without the P-clause. It is clear that sense (d) is of a different order from senses 
(a)-(c). In what follows we will speak of ‘indispensable P-clause’ in sense (d), and of ‘necessary and/or sufficient 
condition’ in the senses (a) and (b). Where it is necessary to distinguish between the latter senses, we will speak 
of ‘necessary and/or sufficient A-condition’ (where ‘A’ stands for ‘actualization’) in sense (a), and of ‘necessary 
and/or sufficient T-condition’ (where ‘T’ stands for ‘truth’) in sense (b). If the distinction between (a) and (b) is 
not crucial, the two possibilities will be subsumed under the expression ‘P is a sufficient and/or necessary 
condition for Q’. 
It is clear that the question whether or not P is a sufficient and/or necessary A/T-condition for Q does not 
apply to conditionals whose P-clause does not express a genuine condition. This in principle excludes all 
rhetorical conditionals, except the anchoring-P ones (which, as we saw in section 10.1.2, could be considered as 
purely case-specifying-P conditionals whose P-clause is used for a rhetorical purpose) and conditionals with a 
presupposition-evaluating P-clause which express a real condition (e.g. when the conditional is about an if-it-
exists entity or situation). In other words, when examining A/T-conditions, we need to consider only case-
specifying-P conditionals (where P is either actualization-conditioning, premise-expressing or purely case-
specifying), anchoring-P conditionals and presupposition-evaluating-P conditionals. It is in these conditionals 

 
260
that the idea of P being or not being interpreted as a sufficient and/or necessary A/T-condition for Q forms an 
important ingredient of the interpretation of the conditional as a whole. 
The fact that we speak of ‘interpretation’ rather than ‘semantics’ is relevant. As we will see, the idea of 
necessary condition may have a semantic origin (e.g. in prerequisite P-clauses introduced by provided, only if, on 
the understanding that, etc.), but it may also be a question of implicatures. For example, we shall see that it is 
typical of actualization conditionals that even if the P-clause does not express a semantically necessary and/or 
sufficient condition, there is frequently an implicature that the actualization of the P-situation is both necessary 
and sufficient for the actualization of the Q-situation. 
 
12.2. (In)dispensable P-clauses 
 
Now that the necessary preliminaries are complete, let us first turn to the issue of P-clauses that are 
(in)dispensable in sense (d), i.e. to the question whether the presence of the P-clause is a necessary condition for 
the consistency of the conditional, i.e. for the interpretability of the Q-clause (and hence of the conditional as a 
whole) and for the syntactic integrity (completeness) of the conditional. We will not examine the dispensability 
or indispensability of the P-clause for every (functional or syntactic) type of conditional, but rather point out 
some typical cases. A striking illustration of a conditional whose P-clause is not indispensable is the 
metalinguistic-P conditional: 
(878) 
a. 
If I might borrow one of my son’s expressions, that’s a load of crap. 
 
 
b. 
I would say he’s rather mouse-like, if you can say that of someone who’s over six foot tall. 
On the other hand, there are cases in which the P-clause is clearly indispensable. To begin with, there are the 
specificational conditionals in which P is the value specified for the presupposed variable (see section 11.14.5). 
Obviously, one cannot have a specificational structure or interpretation without there being a value constituent: 
(879) 
 
The only reason I’d do that would be if your sister asked me to. 
Another kind of specificational sentence is I’ll go to the pictures if it RAINS, provided it is interpreted as ‘It is 
only if it rains that I go to the pictures’. Here too the P-clause is indispensable because it represents the value of 
the specificational reading. 
The P-clause is also an indispensable constituent if it is the ‘premodifying’ clause of a ‘premodified reduced 
it-cleft’ or ‘inferential it is that-construction’ (see section 11.14.4): 
(880) 
a. 
If anybody needs the publicity, it’s him, not us.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
No. If she were going to pray for anything, it would be for something that was of far greater importance.  
(DOC) 
 
 
c. 
If there’s been an explosion, it’s that the workers haven’t taken the necessary precautions. 
Here, the P-clause contains the ellipted material that is needed to interpret the elliptic Q-clause. Thus, in (880a) 
it’s him is interpreted as ‘it is he who needs the publicity’; in (880c) the Q-clause is similarly a reduced it-cleft 
(‘it is that the workers haven’t ... that is the cause of the explosion’)—see Declerck (1992). 
As a third illustration, there are the (extraposed or nonextraposed) ‘semi-nominal’ P-clauses (see section 
11.11): these, too, obviously form an indispensable constituent of the conditional of which they form part: 
(881) 
a. 
It doesn’t matter if you are poor.  (=If you are poor, your being poor does not matter.) 
 
 
b. 
Do you mind if I smoke?  (=If I smoke, do you mind my doing so?) 
However, semi-nominal P-clauses can be ellipted if their content is recoverable from the linguistic or 
extralinguistic context. For example, I could wave a (lit or unlit) cigarette and ask Do you mind?. 
Another case in which the P-clause is indispensable is when the Q-clause contains a (nominal or verbal) pro-
form that is coreferential with the P-clause or with a constituent of it: 
(882) 
a. 
If you don’t have any money, then I can’t help you.  (‘Then’ is a resumptive pro-form for the P-clause.) 
 
 
b. 
If you’ve got a dog, you need a garden for it. 
 
 
c. 
If Bill disagreed, he gave no sign of it. 
 
 
d. 
If he sells drugs, we have no hard proof that he does. 
It is clear that none of these conditionals would be interpretable and complete without the P-clause, which is, or 
contains, the antecedent of the pro-forms then, it and does. 

 
261
It can be noted, finally, that in tentative-P and counterfactual-P conditionals, the P-clause is usually 
indispensable if it is premise-expressing or actualization-conditioning. With the exception of ‘covert-P 
conditionals’ (i.e. Q-clauses without overt P-clause—see section 11.7.1), independent Q-clauses like Things 
would be better or Dogs would have flown are uninterpretable in isolation: they naturally raise the question ‘If 
what?’ They are not felt to be self-sufficient syntactic structures, but rather constituents of incomplete sentences. 
 
12.3. Utterance conditionals 
 
In cooperatively used relevance-conditionals such as If you’re thirsty, there’s beer in the fridge, the actualization 
of P is a sufficient condition for the relevance of the Q-utterance. (To be more precise, the speaker of a relevance 
conditional assumes a mutual understanding on the parts of the speaker and the addressee[s] that the 
actualization of P is a sufficient condition for the relevance of the Q-utterance.) However, P is not a necessary 
condition, since the relevance of the Q-utterance does not depend on the actualization of P: there may be other 
contexts in which it is relevant to utter the same Q-clause (e.g. If you don’t like wine, there’s beer in the fridge). 
In the same way, the P-clauses of most other kinds of utterance conditionals (discussed in section 10.1) state a 
condition which is sufficient but not necessary for the utterance of the Q-clause. Exceptions to this generalization 
remain possible, though. For example, in some performative-Q conditionals P is a merely sufficient condition for 
the Q-utterance, whereas in others it is also a necessary one: 
(883) 
a. 
If that’s the way you treat me, I {quit / advise you to change your attitude}.  (The closed P-clause gives the 
reason for uttering Q and for performing the Q-situation. However, P is not a necessary condition for doing 
this: Q can be uttered in other P-contexts too.) 
 
 
b. 
If she takes part in the race, I bet she comes in last.  (Here, the open P-clause expresses a necessary 
condition for uttering the Q-clause.) 
 
12.4. A/T-conditions 
 
In the rest of this chapter we will examine what we have agreed to subsume under the label ‘necessary and/or 
sufficient conditions’, viz. A-conditions (=conditions for the actualization of the Q-situation) and T-conditions 
(=conditions for the truth of the Q-proposition). As noted above, only conditionals that are case-specifying-P, 
anchoring-P, or presupposition-evaluating-P are relevant to this discussion. 
 
12.4.1. The definition of ‘necessary’ and ‘sufficient’ A/T-condition 
 
Before starting the discussion proper, it is necessary to give precise definitions of what we mean by ‘necessary’ 
and ‘sufficient’. A condition P is necessary if Q is taken to require P. That is, P is a necessary A-condition if the 
Q-situation cannot actualize if the P-situation does not, and P is a necessary T-condition if Q cannot be true if P 
is not. The standard test for necessity is therefore that ‘not-P’ entails ‘not-Q’. If P is a necessary condition for Q, 
it may or may not be the only condition: there may be other (necessary and/or sufficient) conditions besides it. A 
nonnecessary condition is one that is not required by Q: ‘not-P’ does not entail ‘not-Q’. 
P is a sufficient condition for Q if it automatically entails Q. It is a nonsufficient condition if it does not do so, 
i.e. if Q requires the fulfilment of other conditions besides P. 
Another important preliminary is a reminder that we are not here looking at necessity and sufficiency as 
semantic criteria in the way that these terms are used by logicians. In the remaining part of section 12.4 we will 
be concerned with questions about whether, and in what circumstances, an A/T-condition is interpreted as a 
sufficient or/and necessary condition. That is, we will be concerned with any (semantic or pragmatic) factor that 
induces a particular kind of interpretation. 
 
12.4.2. The origins of necessity and/or sufficiency understandings 
 
The necessity or sufficiency of a condition may be determined by various factors. Firstly, it follows from the 
definitions given in section 12.4.1. that if P is the only A/T-condition for Q, it is automatically a necessary and 
sufficient condition (e.g. Ice kept in a freezer melts if the temperature in the freezer rises to or above zero 
degrees Centigrade). This is a pragmatic factor. The second is a semantic one: the idea of necessary condition 
may be determined by the lexical meaning of the conjunction, as when we use on condition that, which 
introduces a ‘prerequisite’ condition. The third factor is again of a pragmatic nature: the idea of necessary 

 
262
condition may follow from an implicature of the conjunction used. For example, unless normally implicates 
‘except iff’ (see section 13.1). Another pragmatic factor may be the presence of a pragmatic presupposition that 
is attached to a particular constituent of the conditional. (A presupposition is by definition treated as a necessary 
condition.) For example, in If you have a dog, you need a garden for it, the it in the Q-clause refers to ‘the dog 
that you have’, and thus presupposes ‘you have a dog’. In such a case, because Q cannot be interpreted if its 
presupposition fails, P, which supplies the presupposed material, is a necessary condition. Examples of this type 
of necessary condition will be discussed in section 12.4.3. A further pragmatic factor is that, in neutral-P 
conditionals expressing a general (omnitemporal) truth (e.g. If water boils, it changes into steam), it is the 
speaker’s and hearer’s shared world-knowledge, in this case of physics, that engenders the interpretation that P is 
a sufficient and necessary condition. 
Last but not least, the necessity and/or sufficiency understanding may be determined by the pragmatic rules of 
conversation (Gricean Maxims). This is often the case in implicative possible-world conditionals where there is 
no semantic reason to interpret the (factual, neutral,26 closed, open, tentative or counterfactual) P-clause as 
expressing either a sufficient or a necessary condition. In that case the necessity and/or sufficiency understanding 
is a question of implicatures. This factor is probably the most general one giving rise to an interpretation of P as 
a ‘necessary and sufficient condition’ and operates as follows. Consider the following examples, all of which are 
interpreted as having a P-clause expressing a necessary and sufficient A/T-condition: 
(884) 
a. 
If I had a health problem, I went to Dr. Botch.  (factual-P) 
 
 
b. 
If you smoke a lot, you’d better take daily supplements of vitamin C. (neutral-P) 
 
 
c. 
If (as you say and I believe) he was in the corridor, he must have heard everything.  (closed-P) 
 
 
d. 
If it rains, we’ll stay inside.  (open-P) 
 
 
e. 
I would punish you if you did that.  (tentative-P) 
 
 
f. 
If she had left me, I would have wanted to die.  (counterfactual-P) 
Strictly (semantically) speaking, these conditionals express no more than a relation of compatibility between the 
actualization of the P-situation (or the truth of P) and the actualization of the Q-situation (or the truth of Q) in the 
same theoretical world. It is not part of their semantics that P is a sufficient or necessary condition for Q. 
However, failing any indication to the contrary, these conditionals implicate that this is the case. For example, If 
it rains, we’ll stay inside is normally understood as meaning (a) that rain is a sufficient condition for staying 
inside and (b) that if it does not rain, we will not stay inside (in other words, that P is a necessary condition). 
Interpretation (b) was first discussed by Geis & Zwicky (1971), who called it “conditional perfection”: the 
interpretation of if is often such that a one-way conditional (‘if P, Q’) is ‘perfected’ into a ‘bi-conditional’ (‘if P, 
Q’ + ‘if not-P, not-Q’). In other words, ‘if P, Q’ is often interpreted as ‘iff P, Q’ (=‘Q only if P’). Geis & Zwicky 
treated conditional perfection as an instance of an “invited inference”, and explained it as following from a 
mysterious “connection between linguistic form and a tendency of the human mind” to perfect conditionals to bi-
conditionals. 
As is typical of (nonconventionalized) conversational implicatures, both the sufficiency understanding and 
the necessity understanding can be cancelled by the context: 
(885) 
a. 
If it rains, we’ll stay inside—provided the headmaster agrees, of course.  (Rain is not the only condition 
here, hence it is not a sufficient condition.) 
 
 
b. 
If it rains, we’ll stay inside. In fact, we will stay inside anyhow, even if it doesn’t rain.  (Here the second 
sentence cancels the idea of necessary condition—see Haegeman 1984.) 
The necessity implicature can also simply fail to arise, as in Mother will be happy if you tell her that, which does 
not suggest that Mother will not be happy if she is not told the news in question. 
In sum, there are Gricean implicatures that see to it that in possible-world conditionals (i.e. conditionals with 
a factual, neutral, closed, open, tentative or counterfactual P-clause) used as actualization conditionals or direct 
inferentials (that is, used as implicative conditionals), P is normally interpreted as both a sufficient and a 
necessary condition for Q.27 How these implicatures operate becomes clear when we consider the following 
example:28 
                                              
26 With the exception of the type If water boils it changes into steam (see above). 
27 Obviously, we disagree with van der Auwera’s (1983: 298) claim that “all conditionals of the form ‘if p then q’ assert that ‘p’ is a 
sufficient condition for ‘q’”—a claim which is repeated in van der Auwera (1986: 199). This claim rules out the possibility that 
sufficiency may be only implicated. On the other hand, we have found an ally in James (1986), who argues that “sufficiency is not 

 
263
(886) 
If it doesn’t rain next Sunday, we’ll drive to the seaside. 
The eventual truth (in the actual world) of the assertion Next Sunday we’ll drive to the seaside depends on a 
variety of pragmatic conditions: we are still alive next Sunday, we are not seriously ill, we have a car at our 
disposal, the seaside is within driving distance, one of the persons included in the reference of ‘we’ can drive a 
car, etc. When uttering (886), all these conditions are pragmatically presupposed to be fulfilled. The condition 
referred to in the P-clause is no more than a further condition. This means that it is not really a sufficient 
condition: all the pragmatic conditions have to be fulfilled as well. However, since the speaker mentions this 
condition only, she obviously sees it as the only relevant condition, i.e. as the only condition which is not self-
evident, since all the other conditions are pragmatically presupposed to be fulfilled. In accordance with the 
Gricean Maxims of Quantity (part 1) and Relevance, the P-condition is the only one that needs mentioning, 
because it is the only one that presents necessary (new) and relevant information. It follows that it is interpreted 
as a sufficient and necessary condition, since all the other conditions are disregarded. 
In sum, in the actual world, absence of rain is not the only condition for driving to the seaside, and is neither a 
sufficient nor a necessary condition for doing so. However, the fact that it is mentioned as a condition, and that it 
is the only condition mentioned, implicates that this condition can be seen as both sufficient and necessary: if 
only one condition is mentioned, the hearer has a right to conclude that there is in fact only one (relevant) 
condition, hence that the condition mentioned is the one necessary and sufficient condition for Q. In the absence 
of any indication to the contrary, (886) will therefore be interpreted as meaning that absence of rain on Sunday is 
a necessary and sufficient condition for the proposition ‘We drive to the seaside’ to become true in the actual 
world.29 
The above explanation applies to implicative conditionals only. Neither implicature arises in nonimplicative 
ones: 
(887) 
a. 
If you need me, I’m in the garden.  (relevance conditional) 
 
 
b. 
If there’s hooliganism after the match, we’re fully prepared for it.  (purely case-specifying-P + pseudo-Q) 
 
 
c. 
If you’re inviting me for a drink, I must say no. [I haven’t got time now.]  (utterance-licensing-P + 
performative-Q) 
 
 
d. 
I’ll find her, if it takes me the rest of my life!  (concessive-P) (This sentence does not implicate that the 
possibility of the search taking the rest of my life is a sufficient and/or necessary condition for my finding 
her.) 
Moreover, (as already noted) even in implicative conditionals, the implicatures may fail to arise because they are 
blocked by pragmatic knowledge: 
(888) 
[What shall we give Jill for her birthday?]—She would be happy if she was given a necklace. 
                                                                                                                                                            
asserted but only conversationally implied” (p. 457). However, the explanation he offers of how the implicature arises (pp. 458-459) 
differs from ours. 
28 For a review of alternative explanations (having to do with scalarity), see van der Auwera (1997a). Other explanations based on the 
idea of scalar implicatures are offered by van der Auwera (1997a) and Horn (2000). 
29 This explanation was also presented by de Cornulier (1983), Funk (1985: 366) and others (see van der Auwera [1997a]). However, 
we also found several alternative explanations. 
 
   According to Akatsuka (1991: 35-6), the reason why If you mow the lawn, I’ll give you ten dollars is interpreted as implying ‘If 
you don’t mow the lawn, I won’t give you ten dollars’ is that the sentence “is normally understood to mean ‘If you mow the lawn, 
I’ll give you ten dollars as a reward.’ A reward must be earned.” However, this explanation does not explain why If it doesn’t rain 
tomorrow, we’ll go to the seaside implicates If it rains tomorrow, we won’t go to the seaside (since Q does not here constitute a 
reward for P). 
 
   Dik’s (1990) explanation of the necessity implicature is not very convincing either: “A conditional of the form ‘if A, then B’ 
invites the inference ‘if not A, then not B’ in a situation in which it is clear to both speaker and addressee that B will not occur in the 
normal course of events.” (p. 245) Since saying that situation B “will not occur in the normal course of events” is equivalent to 
saying that B will only occur under a special condition, this explanation seems to make the bizarre statement that ‘if P, then Q’ 
implicates ‘iff P, then Q’ if Q is dependent on a condition, i.e. if ‘if P, then Q’ is a conditional. (This explanation also seems to 
predict [wrongly] that all conditionals have the necessity implicature.) 
 
   We are not convinced either by the explanation offered by Dancygier & Sweetser (1997). According to them, the necessity 
implicature “follows almost inevitably, not from conditionality per se, but from one central function of conditional constructions, 
namely conditional prediction” (p. 111). More specifically, “in predictives, given the need to understand the prediction as based on 
the most relevant correlation, the setting up of a conditional mental space is understood as a simultaneous setting up of an 
alternative mental space in which P does not hold, and therefore not-Q is expected to hold as a result.” (p. 114) However, this 
explanation seems to be refuted by the simple observation that the necessity implicature works equally well in nonpredictive 
conditionals like If the weather was fine, we went to the seaside as in predictive conditionals like If the weather is fine, we’ll go to 
the seaside.

Since it is natural that there are many different circumstances in which people may be happy, the necessity 
implicature ‘Jill would be happy only if she was given a necklace’ (=‘Jill would not be happy if she was not 
given a necklace’) does not arise: it is blocked by our pragmatic knowledge of the world. 
To adduce some further illustrations of the implicature of necessity: the implicature that, in suitable contexts, 
if must be read as iff (=‘if and only if’)) is present in If she came I would be happy but is cancelled in If she came 
I would be exactly as happy as I am now. Similarly, the implicature is present in If he repeats that behaviour, I 
will notify the board but is cancelled if one adds In fact, I think I am going to notify the board anyhow. In the 
same way, If we had taken the other road, we would have arrived by now implicates that taking the other road 
was a necessary condition for arriving in time, but this implicature is blocked by the addition of also to the Q-
clause: If we had taken the other road, we would also have arrived by now. 
As noted by König (1986: 236) and Dancygier (1998b: 163), the addition of even to an implicative if-
conditional also blocks the necessity implicature. Even has this effect irrespective of whether P and Q are 
positive or negative. For example: 
(889) 
a. 
Jane will help you if she has the time. 
 
 
b. 
?Jane will help you even if she has the time. 
(890) 
a. 
Jane won’t help you if she doesn’t have the time. 
 
 
b. 
?Jane won’t help you even if she doesn’t have the time. 
(891) 
a. 
Jane will help you if you don’t treat her badly. 
 
 
b. 
?Jane will help you even if you don’t treat her badly. 
(892) 
a. 
Jane will not help you if you treat her badly. 
 
 
b. 
?Jane will not help you even if you treat her badly. 
In each of the (a) examples, if is by implicature interpreted as ‘iff’. In each of the (b) sentences, the addition of 
even blocks this reading. (These even if-sentences are odd because the ‘sense of unexpectedness’ induced by 
even—see section 14.1—is hardly compatible with the contents of the conditional to which even is added: our 
knowledge of the world tells us that having the time is not a very unlikely condition for helping someone but in 
fact virtually a necessary condition for doing so; similarly, we do not normally help a person unless that person 
does not treat us badly.) 
Dancygier’s (1998b: 163) explanation for this blocking effect of even is as follows. According to her, the 
necessity implicature typically arises with causal conditionals: since (in her opinion) even if-conditionals are 
never causal (i.e. they mean “Q despite P” rather than “Q because of P”), they do not yield the necessity 
implicature. However, we will argue in 14.1.1 that implicative even if-conditionals do have a kind of causative 
meaning, since they have the nonpreclusive understanding ‘even P does not prevent Q’. In addition, the 
following examples show clearly that it is wrong to assume that even if-conditionals are never causal: 
(893) 
a. 
[I’ll leave not only if Bill comes but also if Jim comes.] I’ll even leave if Gordon comes.  [adapted from 
Barker (1994: 251)] 
 
 
b. 
Even if you drink (just) a drop, you’ll get fired. 
(893a) yields a causal interpretation (‘even Gordon’s coming will cause me to leave’) but there is no necessity 
implicature (i.e. no understanding that I will leave only if Gordon comes.) Similarly, in (893b) drinking a drop 
clearly causes the Q-situation, but the implicit contrast of ‘a drop’ with other quantities which are more obvious 
(i.e. expectable, probable) candidates to satisfy the variable X in ‘if you drink quantity X you’ll get fired’ rules 
out the necessity implicature. Moreover, the claim that the necessity implicature requires a causal reading is 
disproved by examples like If any of these children is wearing an Air Force badge, he or she has a parent in the 
Air Force. The ‘Q because of P’ interpretation is certainly ruled out here (at least if the sentence is to be 
interpreted as true in the actual world), but the necessity implicature is not: the sentence could be read as ‘It is 
only if these children are wearing an Air Force badge that they have a parent in the Air Force’ (which may 
actually suggest ‘P because of Q’ rather than the other way round).30 
In our opinion, König’s (1986) explanation is the correct one: “concessive conditionals ... exclude conditional 
perfection as an admissible inference pattern by entailing or presupposing that the conditional relationship holds 
for a whole series of antecedents.” (p. 236) In our terminology (section 14.1.2), this means that the ‘if and only 
                                              
30 Surprisingly, Dancygier (1998b) seems to agree with this: “There is some confusion among inferential conditionals, as some seem 
to pass the test [for inviting the conditional perfection inference], while others do not. Thus if the protasis is accepted (even though 
only tentatively) as the only premise licensing the conclusion, perfection is applicable, as in the case of If he was wearing a purple 
jacket, then it was him I saw at the party.” (p. 163) 

 
265
if’ interpretation of if in even if-conditionals—at least in implicative even if-conditionals—is incompatible with 
the scalar meaning of even: ‘even if P1, Q’ implies that there are other values of the type ‘if P, Q’ on the even if-
scale. This means that there are other conditions besides P1 that are sufficient for Q, hence that P1 is not a 
necessary condition. 
According to James (1986: 461-462), who says nothing about the effect of even on the necessity implicature, 
even cancels the sufficiency implicature. This is obviously true: like the addition of still to the Q-clause, the 
addition of even to if has the effect of turning an actualization-triggering P-clause into a ‘nonpreclusive’ one (see 
sections 9.1.2.4 and 14.1.1). Compare: 
(894) 
a. 
If Millie comes, we’ll bake a cake.  (actualization-triggering-P conditional, implicating that Millie’s 
coming is a necessary and sufficient condition for our baking a cake) 
 
 
b. 
Even if Millie comes, we’ll bake a cake.  (=Millie’s coming will not prevent us baking a cake. There is no 
implicature that Millie’s coming is a sufficient condition for our baking a cake. This idea is absent because 
‘even’ indicates that we will bake a cake, not because of Millie’s possible arrival but in spite of it.) 
James (1986: 478) also argues that the sufficiency implicature of if is also cancelled by the addition of only. (The 
necessity implicature obviously is not—in fact, the addition of only creates a prerequisite P-clause). However, 
we do not think this is correct. In our opinion The boys played in the yard only if the teacher was there does 
implicate that the teacher’s being in the yard was a sufficient condition for the boys to play there. The addition of 
only does not alter the fact that if the teacher was there is the only condition mentioned, and is therefore by 
implicature interpreted as a sufficient condition. 
We do not agree with James (1986: 467) either where he claims that both external negation and negation of Q 
cancel the sufficiency implicature. The example given is (895a), which can be interpreted either as (895b) or as 
(895c): 
(895) 
a. 
The cat is not purring if it is on the mat. 
 
 
b. 
It is not the case that the cat is purring if it is on the mat.  (external negation: denied conditional) (=it is not 
true that ‘if [+p], [+q]’) 
 
 
c. 
If the cat is on the mat, it is not the case that it is purring.  (negation of Q: conditioned denial) (=‘if [+p], [-
q]’) 
In our opinion, the conditional which is denied (rejected) in reading (895b), viz. ‘The cat is purring if it is on the 
mat’ implicates that [+p] is sufficient for [+q]. Since the external negation denies the truth of the conditional as a 
whole (and thus of the relation between P and Q), the sufficiency understanding is indeed cancelled by not. 
Reading (895c), by contrast, does implicate that [+p] is a sufficient condition for [-q]. (These interpretations of 
the data are in keeping with the different scopes of the negation.) 
Returning to the subject of cancelling or blocking the necessity implicature, we can point out that the 
implicature is also blocked if the conditional conjunction is focused by a restrictive focusing adverb like 
especially, particularly, etc.: 
(896) 
a. 
An amateur video poses fewer problems, especially if it is done in addition to professional photographs.  
(COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
Marjorca has a wealth of well-kept secrets, particularly if you head inland.  (COB-W) 
The reason why focusing adverbs like even, especially, particularly, etc. have this cancelling effect is that it is 
inherent in their meaning that they induce an ‘exclusiveness understanding’, i.e. they evoke the idea that some 
possible referents are excluded from what the predication applies to. For example, sentences whose subject is an 
indefinite noun phrase like a man, three people, etc. have an exclusiveness understanding: {A man / three 
people} protested implies that there were other people who might have protested but did not, i.e. that at least one 
potential protester is excluded from the reference of the subject NP (about which the predication is made)—see 
Declerck (1987). Focusing adverbs like even or especially create a similar (but somewhat different) 
exclusiveness understanding: {Even / especially} John protested implies that there was at least one other person 
who protested, but who is not included in the reference of {even / especially} John. If such a focusing adverb is 
added to a P-clause, the ‘exclusiveness understanding’ is that the condition mentioned (viz. P) is not the only 
condition for Q: I will do it even if JOHN protests implies that there are other conditions (linked up with other 
possible protesters) under which I will do it. 
A final note on the necessity implicature (conditional perfection) is that Akatsuka (1991: 36) is right to point 
out that Geis & Zwicky (1971) are mistaken when they claim that the implicature also arises in ad absurdum 
conditionals: “no non-logician will infer (897b) from (897a)” (Akatsuka 1991: 36): 

 
266
(897) 
a. 
If Confucius was born in Texas, I’m Dracula. 
 
 
b. 
*If Confucius was not born in Texas, I’m not Dracula. 
In our opinion, the necessity implicature does not arise in indirect inferentials because P is not pragmatically 
interpreted as a condition for Q. Our explanation for the implicature, viz. that P is assumed to be a necessary 
condition for Q because it is the only condition mentioned, obviously does not apply if P is not interpreted as a 
condition for P at all. In what follows, ‘T-conditions’ will therefore be taken to cover direct inferentials only. 
 
12.4.3. Sufficiency and/or necessity interpretations of A/T-conditions 
 
Since A/T-conditions may be interpreted as either necessary or nonnecessary and as either sufficient or 
nonsufficient, there are four theoretical possibilities to be examined. (Remember that the issue of sufficiency 
and/or necessity interpretations of A/T-conditions only pertains to case-specifying-P, anchoring-P, and 
presupposition-evaluating-P conditionals.) 
 
12.4.3.1. P is interpreted as a sufficient and necessary condition for Q 
 
The A/T-conditions that are interpreted as both sufficient and necessary for Q include the following types: 
(a) P is obviously a necessary condition in prerequisite-P conditionals. In section 9.1.3 these were defined as 
conditionals whose P-clause is syntactically fully integrated into the Q-clause and is introduced by a conjunction 
or phrase which has the idea of necessary condition as part of its lexical semantics (e.g. provided, on condition 
that, only if, as long as, etc): 
(898) 
a. 
{Providing / on the understanding that / on condition that / as long as} we have been given the correct 
information, this conclusion must be correct.  (necessary T-condition) 
 
 
b. 
{Provided / on condition that / on the understanding that / as long as} you pay me handsomely, I am 
prepared to help you.  (necessary A-condition) 
 
 
c. 
Bill left on condition that the others left too. 
 
 
d. 
This can only be true if all the witnesses are lying. 
It is worth noting that, logically speaking, the necessary condition expressed here need not be a sufficient 
condition—there may in principle be other necessary conditions besides the one mentioned—but, given the fact 
that only this condition is mentioned, it is implicated that this is the only condition, hence that it is a sufficient as 
well as necessary condition. 
Note that a conditional is also of the prerequisite-P type if the P-clause is introduced by unless and is 
syntactically integrated in the Q-clause. (In this case unless means ‘except if’ or, in counterfactual-P 
conditionals, ‘if it weren’t for the fact that’—see sections 13.1 and 13.3.2.) 
(899) 
a. 
Unless you have a really good lawyer, you’re bound to be convicted. 
 
 
b. 
Unless we’d known each other for years, I wouldn’t have left her in your hands. (=If it weren’t for the fact 
that we’d known each other for years, I wouldn’t have left her in your hands.) 
As in the case of other prerequisite-P conditionals, the Gricean Maxims see to it that the necessary condition is 
also interpreted as a sufficient one. Thus, (899a) is interpreted as ‘Only if you have a really good lawyer is it not 
the case that you are bound to be convicted’, while (899b) is similarly interpreted as ‘P [=we had known each 
other for years] was the only condition compatible with #Q’. 
(b) Set-identifying (i.e. set-restricting or subset-excluding) P-clauses express a necessary T-condition if the Q-
clause is positive and the P-clause gives the one and only criterial characteristic of the relevant set. Compare: 
(900) 
a. 
Children are orphans if their parents are dead.  (necessary T-condition; the P-clause defines the relevant 
subset of the set of children by giving the criterial characteristic) 
 
 
b. 
Animals are not mammals if they lay eggs.  (P is not a necessary T-condition for Q: the P-clause does not 
express a criterial characteristic of ‘nonmammals’, and it is not the case that laying eggs is a necessary 
condition for not being a mammal: some animals that are not mammals are viviparous—see section 
12.4.3.2.) 
 
 
c. 
A man is little use if his wife is a widow.  (P is not a necessary T-condition: the P-clause does not give a 
criterial characteristic of the relevant subset of the set of men, as there are other men who are little use 
besides those who are dead.) 

 
267
The idea of necessary condition can be enforced by the addition of only to if. In that case, P is asserted to be the 
one and only criterial T-condition for Q: 
(901) 
Children are orphans only if their parents are dead. 
(c) Restrictive postscript-P conditionals (in which the case-specifying P-clause restricts the validity of the Q-
proposition ‘a posteriori’, i.e. as a ‘postscript’ or ‘afterthought’) express a condition which is interpreted as both 
sufficient and necessary: 
(902) 
a. 
I’ll drop in and see you at 10 tonight—if you will be alone.  (necessary A-condition) 
 
 
b. 
This kind of dog is quite harmless, unless you tease it.  (necessary T-condition) 
Logically speaking, such a postscript addition need not be a sufficient condition, as it might not indicate the only 
possible exception to the validity of the Q-proposition. However, the fact that it is the only exception mentioned 
strongly implicates that there are no other exceptions, hence that the postscript P is not only a necessary but also 
a sufficient condition for Q (or, in the case of unless, for ‘not-Q’). 
(d) Specificational P-clauses express a necessary T-condition if they form part of an inferential conditional:31 
(903) 
a. 
If OSWALD didn’t kill Kennedy, someone else must have done. 
 
 
b. 
[If you have company shares which you would like to donate to Oxfam, we can sell them to help the poorest 
people in the world. And as we don’t pay Capital Gains Tax,] the shares are worth more to Oxfam if we sell 
them for you.  (COB-W) (=The shares are worth more to Oxfam if it is we who sell them.) 
In (903a), P is interpreted as a necessary (and sufficient) condition because the if-clause is interpreted as ‘If it 
wasn’t OSWALD who killed Kennedy...’ Since this specificational interpretation presupposes the existence of 
someone who killed Kennedy, the conclusion that someone other than Oswald committed the murder can only be 
true if P (‘It wasn’t OSWALD who killed Kennedy’) is true. P is therefore a necessary T-condition for Q. At the 
same time it is a sufficient T-condition, since Q is represented as logically following from P. (In inferential 
conditionals, the truth of P is always interpreted as a sufficient condition for the truth of Q.) 
(e) In section 12.2 we have seen that the P-clause is an ‘indispensable clause’ in specificational conditionals in 
which P is the value specified for the presupposed variable. In such conditionals P also expresses a necessary 
condition if the variable is expressed by a definite noun phrase: 
(904) 
The only case in which I might jump through the window would be if a fire broke out in the flat below.  
(necessary A-condition) 
As explained in Declerck (1988b: 28-36), specificational sentences with a definite variable noun phrase have an 
‘exhaustiveness understanding’. This means that, as a result of the Gricean Maxims of Quantity (part 1) and 
Relevance, the set of values specified is taken to consist of all the (relevant) values that satisfy the variable.32 If 
only one value is specified, this is interpreted as meaning that there is no other value satisfying the variable. If 
that one and only value is expressed in the form of a P-clause, P is interpreted as being not only a necessary but 
also a sufficient condition for Q. 
(f) As argued in 12.2, a P-clause is also ‘indispensable’ if it is the ‘premodifying’ clause of a ‘premodified 
reduced it-cleft’ or ‘inferential it is that-construction’ (see section 11.14.4). Here too we can add that such a P-
clause expresses a necessary T-condition. This is a natural consequence of the fact that the if-clause spells out the 
presupposition of existence which is attached to the variable for which a value is specified in the Q-clause. (A 
presupposition is by definition a necessary condition.) 
(905) 
a. 
If anybody needs the publicity, it’s him, not us.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
If there has been an explosion, it’s that the workers have not taken the necessary precautions. 
As in the previous cases, the necessary condition is also pragmatically interpreted as a sufficient one because it is 
the only condition mentioned. The same applies to the following variant of a premodified reduced it-cleft: 
                                              
31 It will be argued in section 12.4.3.2 that a specificational P-clause is not interpreted as expressing a necessary condition if it forms 
part of a noninferential conditional. 
32 There is no exhaustiveness understanding if the noun phrase expressing the variable is an indefinite noun phrase, as in One person 
who wasn’t there was John. The idea of exhaustive reference is ruled out here by the idea of ‘exclusive reference’ which is typical 
of indefinite noun phrases: One person who wasn’t there implies that there were other persons (besides John) who were not there. 
The value noun phrase John cannot, therefore, represent the exhaustive list of people satisfying the variable.

(906) 
If any pupil was likely to drive his teacher to retirement, to resignation, even to suicide, that pupil was Kevin 
Costyn.  (DOC) (The Q-clause is again specificational but is not a reduced cleft.) 
(g) Another type of P-clause that was called ‘indispensable’ in section 12.2 is the type which (in section 11.11) 
we have labelled ‘semi-nominal’ P-clause. The condition expressed in such a P-clause (whether extraposed or 
not) is automatically a necessary condition if P is presupposed (closed). Compare: 
(907) 
a. 
It doesn’t matter if you are poor. 
 
 
b. 
I don’t mind if you smoke.  (=If you smoke, I do not mind your doing so.) 
The first example is equivalent to ‘If you are poor, your being poor does not matter’. On a closed reading, P is 
presupposed to be true and therefore represents a necessary T-condition. In (907b), the P-clause can only be 
interpreted as open. It follows that, logically speaking, P is not a necessary A/T-condition (although the P-clause 
is an indispensable constituent of the conditional—see above). However, since it is the only condition 
mentioned, P will pragmatically be interpreted as a necessary condition. 
(h) P is a necessary condition for Q in some conditionals in which the Q-clause contains a pronoun that is 
coreferential with a constituent of the P-clause, as in (908b). (As we have seen in 12.2, the P-clause is an 
indispensable clause in that type of conditional.) Compare (908b) with (908a): 
(908) 
a. 
If you’ve got a dog, you need a garden. 
 
 
b. 
If you’ve got a dog, you need a garden for it. 
In (908a) the case-specifying P-clause expresses a condition which is sufficient for Q, but which is not logically 
necessary (although it may be interpreted as necessary by implicature): there could be many other reasons why 
you need a garden. In (908b), by contrast, the Q-clause specifically states that the garden is needed for ‘it’, which 
is the potential dog mentioned in the P-clause. This means that you need a garden for it presupposes that you 
have a dog. The presupposition-evaluating (see section 10.3.3.3) P-clause qualifies this presupposition, so that it 
refers to an if-it-exists dog. This does not alter the fact, however, that, in (908b), [+p] is not only a sufficient but 
also a necessary condition for the truth of Q: Q can only be true if the condition is fulfilled. This is confirmed by 
the ‘if not-P, then not-Q’ test: if you do not have a dog, you do not need a garden for it. Similarly, P is a 
necessary and sufficient A-condition in (909): 
(909) 
If he has a pet animal, he always looks after it well. 
However, we should not conclude from this that whenever the Q-clause contains an anaphoric pronoun whose 
antecedent can be located in the case-specifying P-clause, [+p] is a necessary A/T-condition for Q.33 The 
presence of such a coreferential pronoun only leads to [+p] being interpreted as a necessary condition if [+p] 
expresses a presupposition of Q. It follows from this restriction that, if the Q-clause is negative, the conditional 
will be unacceptable if P expresses a presupposition (=necessary condition) for the use of the anaphoric pronoun 
in Q, but not if it does not do so. Compare: 
(910) 
a. 
If Jim has a dog, he treats it badly. 
 
 
b. 
If Jim has a dog, he doesn’t treat it badly. 
 
 
c. 
*If Jim hasn’t got a dog, he treats it badly. 
 
 
d. 
*If Jim hasn’t got a dog, he doesn’t treat it badly. 
 
 
e. 
If you’ve got a dog, you don’t need a garden for it. 
 
 
f. 
If you haven’t got a dog, you don’t need a garden for it. 
In (910a), the truth of Q presupposes the truth of [+p]: it is necessary to have a dog in order to treat it badly. 
Sentence (910b) shows that this presupposition can remain intact when the Q-clause is negated: in order not to 
treat it badly it is still necessary to have a dog. That the negation in the Q-clause does not affect the 
presupposition is due to the fact that it is not within the scope of the negator: (910b) is interpreted as ‘If he has a 
dog, that dog he doesn’t treat badly’ (or ‘If he has a dog, it is not treated badly by him’). The unacceptability of 
(910c) and (910d) is due to the fact that the negation in [-p] denies Jim’s having a dog, which is anomalous 
because Q presupposes that he has one. Sentence (910e) resembles (910b) in that it is not within the scope of the 
negator of the Q-clause: (910e) is interpreted as ‘If you’ve got a dog, for that dog you don’t need a garden.’ 
                                              
33 Incidentally, co-reference between the P- and Q-clauses never leads to [+p] being a necessary utterance-licensing condition: in the 
relevance conditional If you want some beer, it’s in the fridge it is clearly not necessary to want some beer for the beer to be in the 
fridge.

However, this time [+p] is not presupposed: in order not to need a garden for a dog it is not necessary to have a 
dog. The acceptability of (910f) is in keeping with this: the negation of [+p] presents no problem because [+p] is 
not a noncancellable presupposition of Q. 
In (908b), (909), (910a-b) and (910e-f), the Q-clause contains an anaphoric it referring to an if-it-exists entity. 
There are also examples in which there is no anaphoric pronoun, but the Q-clause similarly refers to an if-it-
exists situation. In these examples too, the P-clause expresses a condition which is interpreted as necessary, but 
not sufficient: 
(911) 
a. 
[Lewis is not known to have a girlfriend,] and if he does he’s not telling.  (COB-W) (Lewis’s having a girl-
friend is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for him not to say that he has a girl-friend.) 
 
 
b. 
[“Has Stella Grey’s daughter ever got married?” — “I don’t know.] If she has, I’ve never been informed.”  
(DOC) (Stella Gray’s daughter’s possible marriage is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the 
speaker not to have been informed about such a marriage.) 
 
 
c. 
If he noticed Brand, he didn’t comment.  (COB-W) (His noticing Brand is a necessary condition for his 
making no comment on his noticing.) 
What such sentences have in common is that the verb of the Q-clause has an ellipted factive that-clause as object 
or an ellipted ‘preposition + gerund clause’ as prepositional object: 
(911) 
a’. 
[Lewis is not known to have a girlfriend,] and if he does he’s not telling [anybody] that he has one. 
 
 
c’. 
If he noticed Brand, he didn’t comment on his having noticed Brand. 
These complement clauses are factive, and therefore similar to the it of the previous examples in that they carry a 
presupposition of existence. The P-clause qualifies this presupposition, so that the complement clause refers to 
an if-it-exists situation. 
 
12.4.3.2. P is interpreted as a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for Q 
 
So far we have discussed the types of case-specifying conditional in which P is interpreted as an A/T-condition 
that is both necessary and sufficient for Q. In this section we will concentrate on the cases in which P is 
interpreted as sufficient but not necessary for Q. In fact, we have found only two such cases. The first is when 
the conditional involves a set-identifying P-clause that does not give a criterial characteristic of the set that is 
being restricted: A man is little use if his wife is a widow. The working of the sufficiency implicature here is as 
described in section 12.4.2 above. The necessity implicature does not arise because of our pragmatic knowledge 
of the world—there are many cases in which a man is little use—and the outlandishness of the condition 
specified. The second case in which P is interpreted as sufficient but not necessary for Q also depends on general 
world-knowledge, and is illustrated by (912): 
(912) 
Animals are not mammals if they lay eggs. 
For our present purposes, animals can be subclassified into three classes: mammals (which give birth to live 
young and suckle them), viviparous animals (which give birth to live young but do not suckle them), and animals 
that lay eggs. Because of the existence of these three categories, the P-clause in (912) represents a condition 
which is sufficient but not necessary for Q: laying eggs is a sufficient condition for not being a mammal because 
there are no mammals that lay eggs, but it is not a necessary condition for not being a mammal because there are 
nonmammals (viz. viviparous animals) that do not satisfy the condition of laying eggs. 
The conclusion that the P-clause does not express a necessary condition in (912) is in keeping with the fact 
that laying eggs does not represent a criterial characteristic of nonmammals. (Nonmammals form the superset 
comprising both the set of egg-laying animals and the set of viviparous animals.) It was noted in connection with 
(900a) that if a set-restricting P-clause expresses the one and only criterial characteristic of the set in question, it 
represents a sufficient and necessary condition. 
 
12.4.3.3. P is interpreted as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for Q 
 
The third logical possibility to be considered is that P is interpreted as a necessary, but not sufficient, A/T-
condition for Q. In case-specifying-P conditionals, this possibility is realized when a referring term in the Q-
clause is a hyponym of a referring term in the P-clause. (A term A is a hyponym of a term B if B is the name of a 
superset comprising the set named by A. Thus, car is a hyponym of vehicle.) 
(913) 
a. 
If she became an artist, she would become a sculptor.  (‘Sculptor’ is a hyponym of ‘artist’.) 

 
270
 
 
b. 
If I learn a musical instrument, I will learn the piano. 
 
 
c. 
[“You another dur’y ol’ man or somethin’?”] — “If I am, I’m a dirty old police inspector,” [replied Morse, 
in what he trusted was a cultured, authoritative tone].  (DOC) ([+p] is a necessary T-condition: because 
‘police inspector’ is a hyponym of ‘human’ and because Morse is male, Morse cannot be a dirty old police 
inspector if he is not a dirty old man.) 
The special semantic relation between a constituent of P and a constituent of Q entails that P is interpreted as a 
necessary T-condition of Q.34 This time, however, P is not a sufficient condition for Q. Moreover, hyponymy of 
noun phrases leads to P being a necessary condition only if the verb phrase of P is a hyponym of the verb phrase 
of Q. For example, if you learn the piano, then it is automatically true that you learn a musical instrument. But if 
you buy a piano, it is not automatically true that you learn a musical instrument (although it is true then that you 
buy a musical instrument). For this reason, P does not express a necessary condition in If I learnt a musical 
instrument, I would buy a piano. 
Apart from the above possibility, we have not found any case-specifying-P conditionals in which P is 
interpreted as a necessary, but not sufficient, A/T-condition for Q.35 However, we also find this interpretation in 
two types of presupposition-evaluating-P conditionals. In these cases, however, the origin of the necessity 
understanding is not the conditional perfection implicature. It follows that the necessity understanding cannot be 
blocked or cancelled. 
(a) It has been noted above that in premodified reduced it-clefts (e.g. If anyone can help me, it’s you) the P-
clause is necessary because it spells out the presupposition of existence attached to the variable for which a value 
is specified in the Q-clause. The necessary condition is also pragmatically interpreted as a sufficient one because 
it is the only condition mentioned. There is a similar structure in which P is also necessary, but not sufficient: 
(914) 
If ever there was a great politician, Churchill was one. 
Here the P-clause qualifies the presupposition of existence attached to the definite pronoun he, and therefore 
expresses a necessary condition: Q can only be true if P is. In fact, this type differs from the premodified reduced 
it-cleft type only in that the Q-clause is not specificational but ‘predicational’ (see Declerck [1983a, 1983b, 
1988b]): it just predicates a characteristic of the referent of the subject noun phrase (he). However, in spite of 
being the only condition mentioned, P is now not interpreted as a sufficient condition for Q: there being at least 
one great politician does not seem to be a sufficient condition for Churchill being one. This has to do with the 
fact that (914) is not a case-specifying-P conditional: as noted in section 10.3.3.3, (914) is a rhetorical 
conditional with a presupposition-evaluating P-clause. 
(b) In presupposition-evaluating-P conditionals like (915), the P-condition is also interpreted as necessary, but 
not sufficient. These understandings are again not due to implicatures that may go through or may be cancelled. 
The P-clause can only be interpreted as a necessary T-condition because it concerns the existence of a 
noncancellable presupposition, which is by definition a necessary condition. 
(915) 
In retrospect, the linkage (if there were one) appeared so very obvious.  (DOC) 
Naturally, a linkage can only be obvious if it exists—in fact, the definiteness of the noun phrase presupposes its 
existence—but the existence of the linkage is not a sufficient condition for its being obvious. (It should be noted 
that, although it would seem that P here immediately affects only one constituent of the Q-clause, P is really a 
necessary condition for the truth of Q: if if there was a linkage was not true, the linkage appeared so very 
obvious could not be true either.) 
 
12.4.3.4. P is interpreted as neither necessary nor sufficient for Q 
 
                                              
34 Sentences (913a-c) resemble the example If you’ve got a dog, you need a garden for it discussed in 12.4.3.1, except that in the latter 
sentence the P-clause is indispensable (because of the strict coreference between a dog and it), whereas this is not the case in (913a-
c). 
35 This might seem to contradict our earlier claim that when the P-clause is introduced by a conjunction or phrase that automatically 
expresses a necessary condition (only if, provided, on condition that...), the condition need not, logically speaking, be a sufficient 
condition. Thus, Bill left on condition that the others left too does not exclude the possibility that Bill stipulated other conditions 
besides the one mentioned. However, given the fact that only this condition is mentioned, it is implicated that this is not only a 
necessary but also a sufficient condition. This means that although logically speaking, such necessary conditions need not be 
sufficient conditions, they are pragmatically interpreted as sufficient conditions. 

 
271
The fourth theoretical possibility to be considered is that a case-specifying P-clause stipulates an A/T- condition 
which is interpreted as neither necessary nor sufficient for Q. Here we can mention the following types of 
conditionals. 
(a) The first type consists of precautionary and preventative (see section 2.4) in case-P conditionals: 
(916) 
a. 
I always have some cash on me in case my credit card isn’t accepted.  (precautionary) 
 
 
b. 
She shot her hostage in the leg in case he ran away.  (preventative) 
On either interpretation, in case has a meaning different from that of if. This time the actualization of the P-
situation is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for the actualization of the Q-situation. (In fact, in 
[916b] the actualization of the P-situation is improbable for pragmatic reasons.) What we can say, however, is 
that the belief in the possibility of a P-actualization is a sufficient and necessary condition for the actualization of 
the Q-situation. 
(b) As we have seen, many types of conditionals belong to the class where, logically speaking, P is not a 
necessary condition, but where it is pragmatically interpreted as necessary because of an implicature. It is only 
when the implicature is cancelled or blocked that the condition is not interpreted as necessary. This cancelling or 
blocking is usually effected by the context, but there is one type of conditional where it is inherent in the 
interpretation of the construction itself, viz. ‘ad absurdum’ conditionals (e.g. If you wrote this novel, I am 
Shakespeare). The purpose of such a conditional is to imply the absurdity (nontruth) of P via inference from the 
absurdity of Q, and since the absurdity of Q in principle entails the absurdity of any P-proposition accompanying 
Q, P is not a necessary condition. (Of course, this does not alter the fact that the P-clause is ‘indispensable’ if the 
conditional is to be read as an ad absurdum indirect inferential.) 
(917) 
If you’re {a senator / Bill Gates / an astronaut...}, I’m Father Christmas. 
Moreover, though P is a sufficient condition on the literal level (i.e. the level that is required before the inference 
back from the absurdity of Q is made), this is no longer the case when we consider the ad absurdum 
interpretation. Here it is the absurdity of Q that is a condition for inferring the absurdity (nontruth) of P, rather 
than the other way round. On this level of interpretation, while P is not a necessary T-condition for Q, Q is a 
necessary and sufficient T-condition for P, in the sense that the absurdity of Q is a necessary and sufficient 
condition for the inferred nontruth of P. 
 
12.5. Summary 
 
In this chapter we have gone into the question of the sufficiency and/or necessity of conditions and conditional 
clauses. We have made a distinction between the following possibilities: 
(a) ‘Indispensable P-clauses’: the presence of the P-clause is a condition for the interpretability of the Q-clause 
(and hence of the conditional as a whole) and for the integrity (completeness) of the conditional as an 
independent syntactic structure. For example: If he has a dog, he will look after it well. 
(b) The speaker’s belief in the truth of P is a condition in the (weak) sense that it induces her to utter the Q-
clause. This notion of condition applies (inter alia) to relevance conditionals, where the actualization of the P-
situation is taken to be a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for the relevance of uttering the Q-clause. 
(c) The actualization of the P-situation is an A-condition, i.e. a condition for the actualization of the Q-situation. 
(d) The truth of P is a T-condition, i.e. a condition for the truth of Q. 
After defining A/T-conditions, we have investigated the origins of sufficiency and necessity, which may be 
semantic—prerequisite P-clauses by definition express a necessary condition—but which may also be of a 
pragmatic nature—see, for example, the necessity implicature (conditional perfection). 
In the last part of the chapter we have examined the various types of conditional that satisfy one of the 
following four possibilities: 
(i) P is interpreted as a sufficient and necessary condition for Q. 
(ii) P is interpreted as a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for Q. 
(iii) P is interpreted as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for Q. 
(iv) P is interpreted as neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for Q.

Uses and interpretations of unless 
 
 
 
The meanings and uses of unless, as well as the constraints on replacing unless with if...not, are studied in 
great detail in Declerck & Reed (2000). References to, and discussion of, the relevant literature are to be 
found there. In this chapter we will restrict ourselves to presenting the main outlines of the findings of this 
study. 
 
13.1. Syntactically integrated nonirrealis unless-clauses 
 
The basic meaning of ‘Q unless P’ is ‘Q in a case other than P’.1 In nonirrealis unless-conditionals (i.e. when 
the unless-clause has neither a ‘counterfactual-P’ nor an ‘imaginary-P’ meaning—see section 3.11) this 
generally means that ‘Q unless P’ is equivalent to ‘Q except if P’. If the unless-clause is syntactically fully 
integrated into the Q-clause (i.e. if there is no intonational break between the two), there are four semantic 
possibilities, depending on the (positive or negative) polarity of the two clauses:2 ‘[+q] except if [+p]’, ‘[+q] 
except if [-p]’, ‘[-q] except if [+p]’ and ‘[-q] except if [-p]’. The following sentences illustrate these 
possibilities: 
(918) 
a. 
{Unless / Except if} you point out the consequences, people ignore the warning.  (‘except if [+p], 
[+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
{Unless / except if} the body is not discovered for a long time the police pathologist will see that the 
man has been tortured.  (‘except if [-p], [+q]’) 
 
 
c. 
I won’t do it {unless / except if} you help me.  (‘[-q] except if [+p]’)3 
 
 
d. 
I won’t do it {unless / except if} nobody else knows about it.  (‘[-q] except if [-p]’)4 
Because of the ‘except if’ meaning of unless in (918a-d), the logical form of all these sentences is ‘Q except 
if P’. This logical form entails ‘Q; [(not Q) if P]’. (This is Dancygier’s [1985: 68] analysis of unless, which 
we subscribe to in connection with examples like [918a-d], but which [unlike Dancygier] we do not apply to 
all instances of ‘Q unless P’. For instance, I would have been unable to do it unless you had helped me does 
not mean ‘I would have been unable to do it, but I would not have been unable to do it if you had helped 
me.’) The logical form ‘Q; [(not Q) if P]’ in its turn entails ‘If not P, Q’ (=Brée’s [1985] analysis).5 In other 
words, the following are necessarily true if (918a-d) are true:6 
                                              
1 
According to Geis (1973: 235), the meaning of unless is “{under all circumstances except / in any event other than} P, Q.” Our 
analysis differs from this only in that we speak of ‘a case’, not of ‘all cases’ or ‘any case’, because the idea of ‘all / any’ is only 
implicated. 
2 
Semantically, there is no difference between ‘[+q] except if [+p]’ and ‘except if [+p], [+q]’. We therefore treat the two 
notations as equivalent. However, we will sometimes choose the one rather than the other if we want the semantic 
representation to reflect the word order of the unless-conditional under discussion. 
3 
[-q] can be expressed by an affirmative rhetorical question: 
 
(i) 
How could comparisons which reveal differences between jobs be used to justify differences in pay unless comparisons 
which did not reveal those differences justified the same pay?  (LOB) 
4 
It is sometimes claimed that unless-clauses cannot be negative, but this is obviously not true. The following are authentic 
examples: 
 
(i) 
There is absolutely no way ... that anybody is going to manage to get through ... a year in private accommodation on that 
... unless they do not eat.  (ICE) 
 
(ii) 
[He likes to consider that all his achievements are due to his own efforts] and unless he cannot avoid it, he will rarely ask 
for support from others.  (COB-W) 
 
(iii) ... then that’s not particularly your problem unless they’re not paying the rent.  (COB-S) 
5 
Geis (1973: 232) makes the same point when he writes that “sentences of the form ‘S1 unless S2’ logically imply the truth of 
‘S1 if not S2’.” 
6 
This is not to say that there is no difference of meaning or interpretation between ‘unless P’ and ‘if...not P’. The former 
expresses an exception to the validity of Q, whereas the latter states that [-p] is a condition for Q. In many cases an unless-

 
274
(919) 
a. 
People ignore the warning if you don’t point out the consequences.  (‘[+q] if not [+p]’) 
 
 
b. 
If the body is discovered soon, the police pathologist will see that the man has been tortured.  (‘[+q] if 
not [-p]’) (soon=‘not [not for a long time]’) 
 
 
c. 
I won’t do it if you don’t help me.  (‘[-q] if not [+p]’) 
 
 
d. 
I won’t do it if somebody else knows about it.  (‘[-q] if not [-p]’) (somebody=‘not [nobody]’) 
Moreover, because of the necessity implicature (=conditional perfection), if in (919a-d) is normally 
interpreted as iff (=‘if and only if’), unless there is an indication to the contrary. 
Comrie (1986: 79) argues that the semantics of ‘Q unless P’ is ‘[+q] if and only if [-p]’, while Quirk et al. 
(1972: 746) and Clark & Clark (1977) make the similar (but somewhat weaker)7 claim that the correct 
analysis is ‘[+q] only if [-p]’. However, the meaning that these analyses identify is not the semantics of 
unless but an interpretation resulting from the necessity implicature: it is no more than a cancellable 
pragmatic interpretation (see 12.4.2). This is true not only of the interpretation of if as iff (=‘if and only if’) 
but also of the interpretation of ‘unless P’ as ‘if and only if not-P’. For example: 
(920) 
a. 
Unless you pay your debts you get into trouble. 
 
 
b. 
Unless you drive carefully, you’ll have an accident. 
 
 
c. 
(On this course,) unless you work very hard you don’t get top grades. 
The speaker of (920a-b) does not guarantee that there are no other circumstances in which the addressee 
might get into trouble or have an accident. Similarly, a student who has been told (920c) at the beginning of 
the year would not be considered very reasonable if he complained at the end of the year that he had been 
told a lie because he had worked hard, and still had not got a top grade. 
We can conclude that if the necessity implicature (=conditional perfection) is not blocked, ‘[+q] except if 
[+p]’ is interpreted as ‘[+q] except iff [+p]’, which implies ‘[+q] if and only if not [+p]’ (hence also the 
weaker ‘[+q] only if not [+p]’), as well as ‘not [+q] if and only if [+p]’ (hence also the weaker ‘not [+q] only 
if [+p]’ proposed by Fillenbaum [1986: 185]).8 Thus, failing any indication to the contrary, (921a) is 
interpreted not only as entailing (921b) but also as implicating (921c-d). The latter are the two 
representations resulting from perfecting the conditional (921b) into a bi-conditional: 
(921) 
a. 
Unless you pay me now I will sue you.  (‘{unless / except if} [+p], [+q]’) 
 
 
b. 
If you don’t pay me now I will sue you.  (=‘if not [+p], [+q]’) 
 
 
c. 
Only if you don’t pay me now will I sue you.  (=‘iff not [+p], [+q]’) 
 
 
d. 
Only if you pay me now will I not sue you.  (=‘iff [+p], not [+q]’) 
In this illustration, (921d) seems a more natural paraphrase of (921a) than (921c) is. This is because (921a) is 
pragmatically used as a threat or deterrent—see Declerck & Reed (2000: 213). 
It is in keeping with its ‘except if’ meaning (in integrated nonirrealis conditionals), that unless can be 
followed by either [+p] or [-p]. As noted above, this means that unless itself does not form part of the 
proposition P. This explains the well-known fact that, even though an exception may be seen as a kind of 
negative condition (as appears from the paraphrase ‘Q if not P’), an ‘unless [+p]’-clause uses assertive items 
(‘positive polarity items’—see Baker [1970a, 1970b]), where the corresponding if...not-clause (expressing [-
                                                                                                                                                      
clause will suggest that Q is the normal state of affairs, whereas an ‘if...not’-clause does not. Compare, e.g. I like crossword 
puzzles unless they are very difficult and I like crossword puzzles if they are not very difficult. Brée (1985) discusses some 
further reasons why unless and if...not are often not interchangeable. We will refer to still others below. 
7 
Note that ‘If and only if not-P, Q’ is not equivalent to ‘Only if not-P, Q’. I have a walk after supper if and only if the weather is 
not bad implicates that I always have a walk after supper if the weather is not bad, i.e. that fine weather is a sufficient condition 
for my having a walk after supper. The sentence I have a walk after supper only if the weather is not bad does not implicate 
this. 
8 
In what follows, these various ‘paraphrases’ are only illustrated for the possibility ‘[+q] unless [+p]’. However, the three other 
combinations following from the fact that both the Q-clause and the P-clause may be either positive or negative yield similar 
paraphrases. Thus, when the conditional expresses ‘[-q] unless [-p]’ and the implicature goes through, (i) not only entails (ii) 
but also implicates (iii)-(iv): 
 
(i) 
I won’t do it unless nobody else knows about it.  (=‘[-q] unless [-p]’) 
 
(ii) 
If somebody else knows about it I will not do it.  (=‘if not [-p], [-q]’) 
 
(iii) Only if somebody else knows about it will I not do it. (=‘iff not [-p], [-q]’) 
 
(iv) Only if nobody else knows about it will I do it.  (=‘iff [-p], not [-q]’)

p]) uses nonassertive ones (‘negative polarity items’):9 whatever negative aspect of meaning unless has, it is 
to be found in the ‘except’ element of its ‘except if’ meaning only, and does not reverse the polarity of the P-
clause itself. The following pairs illustrate the different uses of polarity items in unless-clauses and in if...not-
clauses: 
(922) 
a. 
I won’t do it unless you give me {some / *any} money (*at all).  (‘Any’ and ‘at all’ are used as 
nonassertive items.) 
 
 
b. 
I won’t do it if you don’t give me {*some / any} money at all. 
(923) 
a. 
If you don’t lift a finger to help me, I quit.  (‘lift a finger’ is a nonassertive item) 
 
 
b. 
*Unless you lift a finger to help me, I quit. 
(924) 
a. 
If John doesn’t care a bit for Mary, he shouldn’t marry her.  (Geis 1973: 283) 
 
 
b. 
*Unless John cares a bit for Mary, he shouldn’t marry her.  (Geis 1973: 283) 
In the above examples, it is only the (non)assertive item that blocks the use of unless and if...not 
interchangeably. However, there are several other types of sentences in which unless cannot replace if...not. 
We will confine ourselves here to giving a few examples. For a discussion the reader is referred to Declerck 
& Reed (2000: 217-223). 
(925) 
a. 
{If you don’t let me down / *Unless you let me down}, I’ll give you £50.  (promise) 
 
 
b. 
I will be surprised {if that book doesn’t sell well / *unless that book sells well}. 
 
 
c. 
{If (as you say) John won’t come / *Unless (as you say) John comes} we needn’t prepare dinner for 
him. 
 
 
d. 
{If class 4b were not / *Unless class 4b were} exactly the best behaved children she’d ever taught, class 
4a were positively monsters. 
 
 
e. 
[This table is going to be difficult to move. I hope John comes.] We’ll have a problem {if he doesn’t 
come / ??unless he comes / *except if he comes}. 
All these examples express the idea ‘Q results from [not P]’. When it has this meaning, if...not does not 
alternate with unless or except if. 
A final remark in connection with integrated nonirrealis unless-conditionals is that even though the 
unless-clause is syntactically integrated, it is not semantically integrated into the Q-clause. This is clear, for 
example, from the fact that it cannot be the focus of an adverb from the Q-clause, nor the focus of a question 
or of a focusing Q-clause.10 Compare the sentences in the following pairs: 
(926) 
a. 
The weekly meeting is only finished before 8 o’clock if it is not John who chairs it.  (=Only if it is not 
John who chairs the weekly meeting is the meeting finished before 8 o’clock.) 
 
 
b. 
*The weekly meeting is only finished before 8 o’clock unless it is John who chairs it.  (ungrammatical 
if the ‘unless’-clause is to be the focus of ‘only’) 
(927) 
a. 
Will you help us if John doesn’t ask you to? 
 
 
b. 
*Will you help us {unless / except if} John asks you to? 
(928) 
a. 
[“He’s an athlete who performs best if it’s raining.” — “No. Quite the opposite.] It’s if it isn’t raining 
that he performs best.” 
 
 
b. 
[“He’s an athlete who performs best if it’s raining.” — “No. Quite the opposite.] *It’s unless it’s raining 
that he performs best.” 
The difference in acceptability between if...not and unless in these examples follows naturally from the fact 
that if...not here expresses a negative condition, whereas unless expresses an exception. 
 
13.2. Syntactically nonintegrated nonirrealis unless-clauses 
 
                                              
9 
See e.g. Geis (1973: 283); Declerck (1991b: 424); Traugott (1997: 157). Brée (1985: 310) rejects the claim that if...not-clauses 
cannot take positive polarity items on the basis of the observation that the following is grammatical: 
 
(i) 
Tomorrow, if Joe still isn’t better, we’ll call in a shrink. 
 
However, (i) fails to prove the point, because the assertive word still does not fall within the scope of not. If it does, the 
sentence is ungrammatical: 
 
(ii) 
Tomorrow, if Joe {*isn’t still better / isn’t better yet}, we’ll call in a shrink. 
10 For these, and similar tests, see Rutherford (1970); Quirk et al. (1985: 1071). The observation that unless-clauses do not 
normally combine with (nonrhetorical) questions was first made in Geis (1973). Dancygier (1998: 171-173) and von Fintel 
(1991) suggest explanations that are different from ours (but which, for lack of space, we cannot go into here). 

 
276
A syntactically nonintegrated unless-clause typically takes postscript position. As in the case of integrated 
unless-clauses, there are four possibilities, depending on the (positive or negative) polarity of the two 
clauses: 
(929) 
a. 
‘[+q]—{unless / except if} [+p]’ 
 
 
b. 
‘[+q]—{unless / except if} [-p]’ 
 
 
c. 
‘[-q]—{unless / except if} [+p]’ 
 
 
d. 
‘[-q]—{unless / except if} [-p]’ 
The following illustrate the various possibilities: 
(930) 
a. 
She’ll be here by nine—{unless / except if} the traffic is bad.  (‘[+q]—unless [+p]’) 
 
 
b. 
You’ll be in trouble—unless you don’t tell anybody about it.  (‘[+q]—unless [-p]’) 
 
 
c. 
I won’t do it—unless you help me.  (‘[-q]—unless [+p]’) 
 
 
d. 
I won’t do it—unless you can’t find anyone else to help you.  (‘[-q]—unless [-p]’) 
Since ‘Q—unless P’ entails ‘Q—(but) not Q if P’, (930a) entails (931a), which in its turn logically entails 
(931b). When the if of (931b) is read as iff (=conditional perfection), the readings (931c) and (931d) are 
implicated: 
(931) 
a. 
She’ll be here by nine—but not if the traffic is bad.  (‘[+q]—but not [+q] if [+p]’) 
 
 
b. 
She’ll be here by nine—if the traffic isn’t bad.  (‘[+q]—if not [+p]’) 
 
 
c. 
She’ll be here by nine—but only if the traffic isn’t bad.  (‘[+q]—iff not [+p]’) 
 
 
d. 
Only if the traffic is bad will she not be here by nine.  (‘iff [+p], not [+q]’) 
Unlike what we have noticed in connection with integrated unless-clauses, there are no cases where an 
if...not paraphrase is possible while the corresponding unless-clause is not. A postscript P-clause introduced 
by if...not or but only if...not can only be interpreted as having an ‘except if’ meaning, i.e. as equivalent to an 
except if-clause or unless-clause. It follows that, unlike (925a-e), the following are assigned the same 
interpretation: 
(932) 
a. 
I’ll give you £20—unless you give me a ticket. 
 
 
b. 
I’ll give you £20—if you don’t give me a ticket. 
 
13.3. Unless in irrealis conditionals 
 
As explained in section 3.11, a conditional has ‘irrealis’ meaning in two cases: (a) if it is a counterfactual-P 
conditional (referring to a world which is represented as being definitely different from the actual world); 
and (b) if it is an imaginary-P conditional, i.e. a conditional which has the form of a counterfactual-P 
conditional but is interpreted as neither counterfactual nor noncounterfactual, i.e. which is interpreted as 
having no truth relation to the actual world at all. An example of the imaginary-P type is In your place I 
wouldn’t have helped him unless he had paid me for it, which tells us nothing about whether, in the actual 
world, I helped him or not.) 
In sum, an irrealis conditional is one which is not presented as possibly matching the actual world.11 The 
world in question may be either purely ‘imaginary’ or ‘counterfactual’. A counterfactual-P conditional refers 
to a P-world which is presented as known to be contrary to the actual world. An imaginary-P conditional 
refers to a world which is presented as existing in the imagination of the speaker only (and which the 
addressee is invited also to imagine). This means that it refers to a world which is not represented as being 
truth-conditionally related to the actual world (irrespective of any inferences about the actual world that 
might be drawn from the utterance of the conditional). In other words, the difference between counterfactual-
P and imaginary-P conditionals is that, whilst the imagination is involved in both cases, in the latter case the 
world imagined is a world which is not represented as having any particular truth relationship with the actual 
                                              
11 It should be noted that not all conditionals with the past perfect in the P-clause and the conditional perfect in the Q-clause are 
irrealis conditionals—see chapter 7. To mention only one exception, a seemingly irrealis conditional may actually be the 
‘backshifted’ version of an open-P conditional with the present perfect in the P-clause and the future perfect in the Q-clause. 
There is no problem with unless in such reported open-P conditionals, as is clear from the following: 
 
(i) 
He said: “Unless you have finished the painting by tonight, all your work will have been in vain, because the customer 
will not want it any more.”  (direct reported speech) 
 
(ii) 
Unless I had finished the painting by the end of the day, all my work would have been in vain, because the customer 
would not want it any more.  (free indirect speech) 

 
277
world, whilst in a counterfactual-P conditional the world imagined is represented as being ‘negatively’ 
related to the actual world, in that it is explicitly different from (i.e. contrary to) it. In a counterfactual-P 
conditional, the P-situation and (by implicature—see section 8.3.2) the Q-situation are interpreted as actually 
unfulfilled (or unfulfillable) in the past, present or future, as in the following: 
(933) 
a. 
I would have been extremely happy if I had got a first.  (normally understood as counterfactual: ‘I did 
not get a first’ + ‘I {was / am} not extremely happy’) 
 
 
b. 
My life would be easier if I had a car.  (normally understood as: ‘I don’t have a car’ + ‘My life is not as 
easy as it would be if I had a car’) 
 
 
c. 
If you had come tomorrow instead of today, you would not have found me at home.  (normally 
understood as: ‘You aren’t coming tomorrow’ + ‘You have found me at home [today]’) 
The following are examples of imaginary-P irrealis conditionals: 
(934) 
a. 
In your place I would have been happy if I had got a first.  (implies neither ‘I did not get a first’ nor ‘I 
{was / am} not happy’) 
 
 
b. 
If the butler had done it, we would have found just the clues that we did in fact find.  (Comrie 1986: 90) 
 
 
c. 
[If John hadn’t told Kelly the truth, someone else would probably have told her sooner or later.] If no 
one else had told her, she would never have found out the truth herself. 
In (934b) it is the relative clause in the sentence itself that sees to it that the understandings ‘The butler didn’t 
do it’ and ‘We didn’t find this sort of clues’ do not arise. (This does not mean, however, that [934b] rules out 
the possibility that the butler did not do it. As we have seen, the fact that it is an imaginary-P conditional 
means that [934b] is vague as to the question whether the butler actually did it or not.)12 In (934c) it is the 
preceding counterfactual that blocks the implicatures ‘Someone else (=other than John) told her’ and ‘She 
found out the truth herself’. 
It has sometimes been claimed that unless cannot be used in irrealis conditionals—see e.g. Dancygier 
(1985: 70, 1998: 174); Geis (1973: 242-243); the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (1978: 
1204); Quirk et al. (1972: 747). However, this claim is disproved by the following: 
(935) 
a. 
But unless I’d gone along with you, you’d have told my husband, I bet.  (COB-W) (*except if) 
 
 
b. 
[There are of course some descriptions under which something we do can be unintentional, but their use 
is derivative. For example,] there would be no such thing as unintentional offence unless we had the 
concept of intended offence in the first place.  (LOB) (*except if) 
There is no doubt that these are counterfactual-P conditionals. Thus (935a) implies both ‘I went along with 
you’ and ‘you didn’t tell my husband’. What is remarkable is that unless cannot be replaced by except if here. 
This means that in counterfactuals, unless does not mean the same thing as except if. 
On the other hand, unless does have the same meaning as except if in imaginary-P irrealis conditionals: 
(936) 
[I didn’t go to the party, so I don’t know if I would’ve become as drunk as you all appear to have been. In 
fact, I’m afraid] I would’ve been drunk too, unless I’d brought my wife with me to keep an eye on me. 
We must conclude, then, that there are two possible interpretations of unless in irrealis conditionals: the 
imaginary-P reading, in which unless is interchangeable with except if, and the counterfactual-P one, where 
unless is more naturally rendered by ‘if it {hadn’t been / weren’t} the case that’ (or ‘if it {hadn’t been / 
weren’t} for the fact that’). The following further illustrate the two interpretations, respectively: 
(937) 
a. 
[I don’t know whether it was John or Gordon who started the fight, but if it was John, I’m sure] he 
wouldn’t have done it {unless / except if} Mark had persuaded him to.  (imaginary-P: ‘unless’ means 
‘except if’) 
 
 
b. 
[I know John’s behaviour was disgraceful, but] he wouldn’t have done it {unless / *except if} Mark had 
persuaded him to.  (counterfactual; ‘unless’ means ‘if it hadn’t been for the fact that’) 
 
13.3.1. Unless in imaginary-P irrealis conditionals 
 
                                              
12 As noted by Iatridou (2000: 243), “there is ample discussion in the literature to the effect that the counterfactuality of 
conditionals appears to be cancelable.” In our opinion, counterfactuality is not cancellable, but it will naturally seem to be so if 
no distinction is made between counterfactual-P and imaginary-P conditionals. (The latter can be used in a context making 
clear that what is presented as imaginary should ultimately be interpreted as factual. The same is not true of counterfactuals.) 

 
278
As we have seen, imaginary-P irrealis conditionals have no factual implicatures about the real world. 
Consequently, an unless-clause in an imaginary-P conditional does not by itself say anything about the 
relation between the unless-situation and the real world. This should be clear from (938a), which receives the 
reading (938b): 
(938) 
a. 
[If the British had wanted to call all-party talks,] they would not have succeeded in bringing the 
Unionists to the table unless Sinn Fein had decommissioned arms.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
[If the British had wanted to call all-party talks, then, if they had called all-party talks,] they would not 
have succeeded in bringing the Unionists to the table {unless / except if} Sinn Fein had 
decommissioned arms. 
The unless-clause in (938a) (in which we can substitute except if for unless) states an exception to what 
would have been the case in the imaginary scenario in which the implied condition (expressed by if they had 
called all-party talks in [938b]) was true. The meaning of the unless-clause is not counterfactual but 
imaginary: there are no implicatures linking the unless-situation to the actual world. That is, (938a) 
implicates neither ‘Sinn Fein decommissioned arms’ nor ‘Sinn Fein did not decommission arms’. 
It should be noted that the presence of the counterfactual if-clause If the British had wanted to call all-
party talks is of crucial importance in (938a). Without it, no imaginary-P world would be created, and the 
unless-clause would receive a counterfactual interpretation (and thus have a positive factual implicature): 
(939) 
The British would not have succeeded in bringing the Unionists to the table unless Sinn Fein had 
decommissioned arms. 
The natural reading here is: 
(940) 
The British would not have succeeded in bringing the Unionists to the table {if it hadn’t been for the fact that 
/ in a case other than the factual case in which} Sinn Fein had decommissioned arms.  (This implicates both 
‘The British succeeded in...’ and ‘Sinn Fein [had] decommissioned arms’.) 
As is the case in (938a), an imaginary unless-clause is typically found in a counterfactual context. The 
following examples further illustrate this: 
(941) 
a. 
[He’s lucky you did it without asking for his help. If I’d been you], I wouldn’t have done it {unless / 
except if} he’d helped me.  (The counterfactual ‘if’-clause ‘If I’d been you’ creates an imaginary 
irrealis world in which ‘I wouldn’t have done it’ is true. The ‘unless’-clause expresses an exception to 
the validity of this imaginary Q-clause and is therefore imaginary itself: it does not by itself implicate 
either ‘He helped’ or ‘He didn’t help’.) 
 
 
b. 
[You’re lucky he did it without asking for your help.] In his place I wouldn’t have done it {unless / 
except if} you’d helped me.  (‘In his place’ is equivalent to ‘if I had been him’.) 
 
 
c. 
[Her new book is splendid. I am sure] YOU wouldn’t have been able to write it {except if / unless} she’d 
helped you.  (The contrastive accent on ‘you’ creates the implicit condition ‘If it had been you who 
undertook writing this book’. The ‘unless’-clause does not implicate ‘She helped you write the book’. Its 
meaning is therefore imaginary, not counterfactual.) 
Apart from the (overt or implied) presence of a counterfactual if-clause, there are other ways in which the 
context can make it clear that an irrealis conditional is to be interpreted as imaginary-P rather than 
counterfactual-P. This is illustrated by the following: 
(942) 
a. 
[I don’t know whether or not Peter hit Jim. If he did,] he wouldn’t have done it {unless / except if} 
Mary had asked him to.  (The factual implicatures ‘He did it’ and ‘Mary didn’t ask him to’, which the 
conditional yields when used in isolation [in which case it is interpreted as counterfactual-P], are 
precluded here by the nonfactuality which is inherent in the open condition ‘if he did’ [which implies 
that the speaker does not know whether Peter did it or not] and which is also signalled by the preceding 
sentence. In this context the irrealis conditional is therefore interpreted as an imaginary-P one.) 
 
 
b. 
[I was asked to resign, but I said “no, I don’t want to leave, you’ll have to sack me”. I was told the 
decision was taken because I stated I was ambitious to manage a big club, but] I would not have left 
unless an offer came in from the biggest, [which was unlikely].  (COB-W) (Here too the context forces 
the conditional clause to be read as imaginary rather than counterfactual: it makes it clear that there is 
no factual implicature ‘An offer came in from the biggest’. [We may infer that the speaker did in fact 
leave the club, but that inference is not derived from the conditional itself but from the context, more 
specifically from the factuality of ‘The decision (to make me leave) was taken because...’]) 

 
279
Out of context, irrealis unless-conditionals may sometimes be ambiguous between an imaginary-P reading 
and a counterfactual-P interpretation. Thus, in isolation (943a) is ambiguous between (943b) and (943c)—see 
Whitaker (1971: 155): 
(943) 
a. 
I couldn’t have got to Slough in time unless I’d had a helicopter. 
 
 
b. 
I couldn’t have got to Slough in time (and I didn’t) unless I’d had a helicopter (which I didn’t).  
(imaginary-P: ‘unless’=‘except if’) 
 
 
c. 
I couldn’t have got to Slough in time (as I did) unless I’d had a helicopter (which I did).  
(counterfactual-P: ‘unless’=‘if it hadn’t been for the fact that’) 
Out of context, the latter interpretation is more natural than the former. (However, in both cases, unless can 
be glossed: ‘in a case other than P’.) 
In all the above examples of imaginary unless-conditionals, the conditional has no factual implicatures, 
and unless can always be replaced by except if. On the other hand, imaginary unless tends not to be 
interchangeable with if...not, especially if the P-clause is not syntactically integrated. Thus, in (944) the 
unless-clause can be replaced with an except if-clause, but hardly with an if...not-clause, at least if the 
imaginary-P sense is to be retained: 
(944) 
[This is not a show to write home about, and since it purports to be a morale-boosting entertainment for 
American troops in wartime London,] it is nothing they would have wanted to write home about either, 
unless complaint was the tone.  (COB-W) 
Similarly, while (945a) is naturally interpreted as imaginary-P, (945b) would normally be read as 
counterfactual-P: 
(945) 
a. 
He wouldn’t have done it unless Mary had asked him to. 
 
 
b. 
He wouldn’t have done it if Mary hadn’t asked him to. 
 
13.3.2. Counterfactual unless 
 
The second meaning which can be expressed by unless in irrealis conditionals (and also by if...not, but not, 
this time, by except if) is the counterfactual-P reading which can be rendered by ‘if it hadn’t been the case 
that’ or ‘if it weren’t for the fact that’. In this case both clauses of the unless-conditional do have a factual 
implicature: 
(946) 
a. 
But {unless / *except if} I had gone along with you, you’d have told your husband, I bet.  (=If it hadn’t 
been the case that I went along with you, you’d have told your husband.) (Factual implicatures: ‘I went 
along with you’ + ‘You didn’t tell your husband’.) 
 
 
b. 
I couldn’t have finished this in time {unless / *except if} you’d helped me.  (=...if it hadn’t been for the 
fact that you helped me) (Factual implicatures: ‘You helped me’ + ‘I managed to finish this in time’.) 
 
 
c. 
I wouldn’t be here {unless / *except if} I was interested, would I?  (=If it wasn’t a fact that I’m 
interested, I wouldn’t be here, would I?) (Factual implicatures: ‘I am interested’ + ‘I’m here’.) 
In these examples, the conditionals are used either in isolation or in a context that triggers neither a 
counterfactual-P nor an imaginary-P (exceptive) reading of the unless-clauses. The latter are interpreted as 
counterfactual for the simple reason that this is their default (unmarked) reading in irrealis conditionals. 
However, the context may confirm this reading, as in (947a), or cancel it, as in (947b): 
(947) 
a. 
[“Why did you do it?”] — “I wouldn’t have done it unless Mary had asked me to.”  (The idea ‘I did it’ 
is not only implicated by the counterfactual-P reading of the conditional but also asserted in the 
preceding sentence. Because of the counterfactual-P meaning, ‘unless’ can be replaced with ‘if...not’ 
but not with ‘except if’.) 
 
 
b. 
I wouldn’t have done it unless Mary had asked me to, [and she didn’t].  (The conditional might initially 
be interpreted as a counterfactual-P with an ‘unless’-clause meaning ‘if it hadn’t been for the fact that 
Mary asked me to’, but this initial reading is cancelled by the following ‘and’-clause. The ‘unless’-
clause is therefore ultimately interpreted as imaginary-P rather than counterfactual-P. It follows that 
‘unless’ can be replaced with ‘except if’, but not with ‘if...not’.) 
As already noted in section 13.3.3.1, an irrealis if...not-conditional normally triggers a counterfactual-P 
interpretation. 
 
13.4. Summary 

 
280
 
The following are the main points we have made in connection with unless: (a) The central (basic) meaning 
of ‘unless P’ is ‘in a case other than P’; in noncounterfactual conditionals this meaning is also expressed by 
‘except if P’; (b) When used in the sense of except if, an unless-clause logically entails the corresponding 
if...not-clause; like except if, unless (in the ‘except if’ sense) can therefore normally be replaced by if...not 
(except in imaginary-P conditionals—see below); (c) Because of the necessity implicature (=conditional 
perfection), ‘Q unless P’ is normally interpreted as equivalent to ‘Q except iff P’; (d) There is no ‘except if’ 
meaning in if...not-clauses that express the idea ‘Q results from [not P]’ (the most common realization of 
which is ‘The nonactualization of the [+p]-situation leads to the actualization of the Q-situation’); it follows 
that in such P-clauses, if...not cannot be replaced by except if or unless—see (925a-e); (e) In irrealis 
conditionals we must distinguish between counterfactual and imaginary unless-clauses; the former implicate 
a relationship (of difference) to the actual world, whereas the latter do not implicate a truth relationship to the 
actual world at all; (f) Out of context, the unmarked reading of irrealis conditionals, including irrealis unless-
conditionals, is the counterfactual-P reading; (g) Imaginary-P readings for irrealis conditionals arise only in 
special contexts: they may be determined by the presence of an overt or implied counterfactual if-clause or 
by other contextual information; (h) In the imaginary interpretation, unless can be replaced with except if but 
not normally with if...not; this is because in irrealis conditionals, the default interpretation of if...not is 
counterfactual-P, i.e. it expresses a negative condition (‘[not P] results in Q’) rather than the ‘except if’ 
meaning expressed by unless in imaginary-P conditionals; (i) In a counterfactual-P conditional, unless is 
interpreted as ‘if it hadn’t been the case that...’ and is therefore interchangeable with if...not, but not with 
except if.

Chapter 14 
 
The meanings and uses of even if 
 
 
 
This chapter summarizes the findings of Declerck & Reed (2001), who argue that even has the unitary 
meaning of ‘expected incompatibility’, but that the effect of adding it to if may vary. 
 
14.1. The meaning of even if in implicative conditionals 
 
In section 3.7 we distinguished between ‘implicative’ and ‘nonimplicative’ conditionals. By ‘implicative’ we 
mean the conditionals in which P induces or implies [+q] or [-q], i.e. in which there is a kind of causal, 
resultative, preclusive, nonpreclusive or licensing link between P and Q. Under this heading we have brought 
together ‘inferential conditionals’ and ‘actualization conditionals’. It is typical of these that they can 
generally be paraphrased in terms of ‘If P, then Q’.13 The following illustrate the two possibilities: 
(948) 
a. 
If it rains, (then) the match is cancelled.  (=actualization conditional: the actualization of the P-
situation results in the actualization of the Q-situation) 
 
 
b. 
If Watt didn’t invent the telephone, (then) someone else must have done.  (=inferential conditional: the 
truth of P leads to the conclusion Q) 
The following are examples of nonimplicative conditionals: 
(949) 
a. 
If John is not smart, at least he is reliable. 
 
 
b. 
If I may say so, I don’t think he is at all to be trusted. 
As we will see, one of the factors determining the interpretation of even if is whether the if-conditional which 
would remain if even were removed (or, as we might put it, the if-conditional to which even is added) is 
implicative or not. Although in even if conditionals themselves there is rarely a direct implicative relation 
between P and Q (see 12.4.2 for exceptions), for the sake of brevity we will refer to even if-conditionals in 
which the corresponding if-conditional is implicative as ‘implicative even if conditionals’ (and to even if-
conditionals in which this is not the case as ‘nonimplicative even if conditionals’). 
 
14.1.1. The expectation understanding plus the nonpreclusive understanding 
 
When added to an implicative conditional, the basic meaning of even is that it evokes a supposition that the 
truth of the P-clause will / would / does etc. cancel the validity of the Q-clause, and at the same time denies 
that supposition. For example, Even if it doesn’t rain we will stay inside is interpreted as ‘You might expect 
that if it doesn’t rain we won’t stay inside, but that expectation is wrong: we will stay inside, even if it 
doesn’t rain’ (=‘You might expect P to entail ‘not Q’, but in fact Q, even if P’). In other words, ‘even if P, Q’ 
evokes two understandings: the ‘expectation understanding’ ‘P precludes Q’ (=‘if P, not-Q’) and the 
‘nonpreclusive understanding’ ‘P does not preclude Q’, which cancels the expectation understanding. The 
following sentences further illustrate this basic meaning of even if. 
(950) 
a. 
Tell her I’ll be there, even if they have to wheel me in.  (DOC) (=It might be supposed that having to be 
wheeled in would mean that I wouldn’t be there, but this supposition would be false: I WILL be there.) 
                                              
13 It should be noted, however, that the addition of even to an implicative conditional removes the possibility of using then. 
Compare If the weather is really bad, (then) we’ll stay at home with Even if the weather is really bad, (*then) we won’t stay at 
home. Since nonimplicative conditionals cannot use then either, it follows that then can never be used in even if-conditionals. 
The same is true of implicative only if-conditionals. However, in an only if-conditional, then may be used if only is repeated 
before it: Only if John is there, {*then / only then} will I go to the party. The restriction on the use of then in even if-
conditionals may be to some extent subject to the same relaxation. For some speakers at least, the following are acceptable: 
Even if it rains, even then the match won’t be cancelled; Even if I crush her tablet into her favourite food, even then she won’t 
swallow it. 

 
282
 
 
b. 
Even if I supported it, the proposal would fail.  (This is understood as ‘You might expect that my 
supporting the proposal would preclude the proposal’s failing [=expectation understanding] but in fact 
my supporting the proposal would not preclude its failing [=nonpreclusive understanding]’.) 
It is worth noting that in some cases the ‘if’-relation does not hold between the P-clause and the overt Q-
clause but between the P-clause and a covert Q-clause that must be reconstructed from the context. In other 
words, the overt Q-clause may be a ‘pseudo-Q-clause’—see section 11.7.2.10. For example: 
(951) 
[She’s got the best motive of any of them, and she’d probably have the nerve as well.] But she couldn’t have 
planned it all, surely, even if somehow she had the opportunity <to commit the murder> that night, [say, after 
she got back from Stratford].  (DOC) 
In this example the meaning is clearly not: ‘You might expect that having the opportunity to commit the 
murder would preclude her not being able to plan it (i.e. would enable her to plan it), but you would be 
wrong: having the opportunity would not preclude the ability to plan.’ In other words, the even if-relationship 
is not between the P-clause and the overt Q-clause. In fact, as we argued in 11.7.2.10 (on ‘pseudo-Q 
conditionals’) regarding similar examples, we would claim that the even if relationship concerns the P-clause 
and a covert Q-clause which we can infer because it represents a situation that is a consequence of the 
situation represented by the overt Q-clause. Thus, what is going on in (951) is that the speaker is going 
through a check-list of what would be required to make a good suspect (viz. motive, means, opportunity). 
She comes to the conclusion that the referent of she would not make a good suspect, even if she had had the 
opportunity (which is hardly likely), because she could not have planned it all. So the message conveyed in 
the even if-conditional is: ‘The view that she’s not a good suspect wouldn’t be undermined (precluded) by it 
transpiring (which is unlikely) that she had the opportunity, because she couldn’t have planned it all.’ That is, 
the ‘even if’ relation holds between the covert Q-clause (which we shall call Q2) she isn’t a good suspect and 
the P-clause she had the opportunity. The overt ‘pseudo-Q-clause’ she couldn’t have planned it all, surely 
(which we shall call Q1), is not the actual Q-clause but gives an explanation for the assertion of ‘Q2 even if 
P’. We can read (951) as: ‘But she couldn’t have planned it all, surely, so she’s not a good suspect, even if 
somehow she had the opportunity.’ 
If the interpretation ‘Even P does not preclude Q’ concerns a covert Q, the overt pseudo-Q-clause as a 
rule expresses the reason why the speaker conveys this message. Schematically, then, such a conditional 
expresses: ‘my believing that Q1 causes me to conclude / say that Q2, even if P’ (where Q1 is the overt 
pseudo-Q-clause and Q2 the covert Q-clause), which is equivalent to: ‘my saying “Q2, even if P” results from 
my believing that Q1.’ It follows that we can paraphrase such a sentence with either ‘[Even if P, Q2] because 
Q1’ or ‘[Even if P, Q1], so that Q2’. Thus, (951) can be paraphrased as ‘Even if she had the opportunity, she 
cannot have committed the murder, because she could not have planned it all’, or, alternatively, as ‘Even if 
she had the opportunity, she could not have planned it all, so she cannot have committed the murder.’ 
The following are some examples similar to (951): 
(952) 
a. 
Even if we had undertaken a hunt, it would not have been successful.  (=Even if we had undertaken a 
hunt, that wouldn’t have changed anything, because it wouldn’t have been successful.) 
 
 
b. 
[She won’t let me alone.] Even if I go upstairs to work, she brings me six cups of coffee in two hours.  
(BOTF) (=Even if I go upstairs to work, I can’t get away from her, because she brings me six cups of 
coffee in two hours.) 
 
 
c. 
Even if there were a sheriff in this town, he wouldn’t be able to stop the bandits.  (=Even if there were a 
sheriff in this town, that wouldn’t solve the problem, because he wouldn’t be able to stop the bandits.) 
 
14.1.2. Scalarity 
 
As is well-known, even is interpreted as a scalar operator because it represents the constituent which it 
focuses as an extremely high or low value on a particular scale. For example, Even Mary managed to do it 
implies that (of those who did it) Mary was the least likely person (or one of the least likely persons) to be 
able to do it.14 
                                              
14 It does not really matter whether we speak of a ‘probability scale’ (with the value ‘most likely’ at the upper end and the value 
‘least likely’ at the lower end) or of a ‘scale of unlikelihood’ (on which the values are ordered in the reverse way). In what 
follows we will adopt the latter convention. 

 
283
Since the expectation understanding and the nonpreclusive understanding of even if concern the 
conditional as a whole (i.e. the relation between P and Q), the scale induced by the use of even if must apply 
to the relation between P and Q. Thus, Tell her I’ll be there, even if they have to wheel me in can be 
interpreted as meaning that their having to wheel me in is the least expected (or at least a highly unlikely)15 
circumstance in which I would be there, and as implying a contrast with other circumstances in which I 
would be there, not just with other ‘less extreme’ circumstances. In other words, in implicative even if-
conditionals each value on the relevant even if-scale is an if-conditional.16 (In the above example, if the 
speaker is in hospital at the time of speaking, the values might be something like I’ll be there if I’m well, I’ll 
be there if I’m still not fully recovered, I’ll be there if I’m still ill, I’ll be there if [I’m so ill that] they have to 
wheel me in, etc.) 
It is interesting to note that the position of the relevant if-conditional (i.e. the one combining with even) on 
the even if-scale is often determined by the position of its P-clause on an ‘ancillary’ (subsidiary) 
propositional scale (P-scale), and that this position may itself be determined by the position of a constituent 
of the P-clause on another ancillary scale. The constituent in question is then strongly accented and is felt to 
be the real focus of even. For example, even may focus a numeral in the even if-clause. In that case the 
numeral is heavily accented and interpreted as representing a (relatively) extreme value on the numerical 
scale (which is a ‘natural’ scale). This numerical scale functions as an ancillary scale to the P-scale (whose 
values are P-propositions, i.e. the propositions expressed by if-clauses minus if) because the position of the 
numeral on the numerical scale determines the position of the P-clause on the P-scale. The latter scale itself 
functions as an ancillary scale to the even if-scale (whose values are if-conditionals) in the sense that the 
position of the P-clause on the P-scale determines the position of the if-conditional on the even if-scale. 
However, since (in implicative even if-conditionals) even always puts the relevant conditional high on the 
scale of unexpectedness, the ordering of the values (conditionals) on the even if-scale may be the reverse of 
what might be considered to be the natural ordering of the values (propositions) on the ancillary P-scale. For 
example, compare: 
(953) 
a. 
Even if you have written SIX papers, you will not pass this exam [if you do not know the coursebook by 
heart].  (In this context, ‘six papers’ is an unusually high value on the numerical scale of ‘number of 
papers compatible with failing this exam’. This numerical scale functions as an ancillary scale to the P-
scale whose values are the P-propositions ‘You have written 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / etc. papers’. The 
high position of ‘You have written six papers’ on this ancillary P-scale, plus the use of ‘even’, 
determines the high position of ‘You will not pass if you have written six papers’ on the ‘even if’-scale 
of unexpectedness.) 
 
 
b. 
Even if you have written NO papers at all, you will pass [if you know the coursebook by heart].  (‘No’ is 
the lower limit of the numerical ancillary scale, hence ‘You have written no papers’ is the lowest value 
on the P-scale [=the scale of propositions expressed by ‘if’-clauses]. However, the values are ordered 
in the reverse way on the ‘even if’-scale: ‘You will pass if you have written no papers’ is the highest 
[i.e. least likely] value on this scale of unexpectedness. The lower values on the scale are ‘You will pass 
if you have written {1 / 2 / 3 / etc.} papers’.) 
Apart from the numerical scale, there are other natural quantificational scales: 
(954) 
Even if EVERYBODY helped, we wouldn’t be able to move that boulder.  (‘Everybody’ represents the highest 
possible value on the quantificational scale of ‘number of people’. It follows that ‘Everybody helps’ is the 
highest value on the P-scale, which is ancillary to the ‘even if’-scale. It follows that ‘We will not be able to 
move that boulder if everybody helps’ ranks highest on the ‘even if’-scale, the lower values being ‘We will 
not be able to move that boulder if {most of us / some of us / not many of us / etc.} help’.) 
Apart from a quantifier, even can also focus another constituent of the if-clause: 
(955) 
a. 
Even if JOHN is late, the coach will leave on time. 
 
 
b. 
We’ll find the girl, even if she’s at the OTHER end of the WORLD! 
                                              
15 According to some people—e.g. Fauconnier (1976); König (1986); van der Auwera (1986)—even marks the extreme of a scale. 
However, this claim is too strong, as has been pointed out by (amongst others) Fillmore (1965), Horn (1969), Anscombre and 
Ducrot (1983), Dancygier (1988a), Kay (1990) and Lycan (1991). 
16 This runs counter to König’s (1986: 232) and Dancygier’s (1998: 162) view that the values are conditions: “the scale implied 
by even is understood as a scale of possible conditions, one of which appears in the protasis” (Dancygier 1998: 162). 

 
284
In such examples, the hearer himself has to identify the ancillary scale which (via the ancillary P-scale) 
determines the even if-scale. Thus, (955b) suggests that one of the least likely cases in which the girl will be 
found is when she is at the other end of the world. In this case the first ancillary scale is the scale of places 
where the girl might be, ordered according to the degree of difficulty they entail of finding the girl: the more 
difficult the place renders it to find the girl, the higher this place ranks on this scale. Naturally, ‘at the other 
end of the world’ is an extremely high value on this ancillary scale. This scale determines the ancillary P-
scale, which is a scale with as values propositions of the type ‘The girl is at X’. In accordance with the 
ordering on the first ancillary scale, the proposition ‘The girl is at the other end of the world’ is an extremely 
high value on this ancillary P-scale. Because of even, the conditional ‘We’ll find the girl if she’s at the other 
end of the world’ is interpreted as lying near the upper limit of the even if-scale (improbability scale), whose 
values are conditionals of the type ‘We’ll find the girl if she’s at X’. (Remember that on the even if-scale the 
least likely if-conditional is the highest value.) Thus, (955b) implies ‘we will find the girl in the very-
unlikely-to-be-compatible-with-finding-the-girl situation of her being at the other end of the world’, as well 
as ‘you might expect that if the girl is at the other end of the world we will not find her, but that expectation 
would be wrong’. 
There are also cases in which even focuses the if-clause as a whole. In that case there is no ancillary P-
scale, and therefore no special (contrastive) accentuation pattern: the nuclear accent of the if-clause is weaker 
and is in its unmarked position, viz. on the last open-class word conveying new information. For example: 
(956) 
a. 
Teachers are being urged by trade union activists not to intervene in violent incidents even if a pupil is 
in danger.  (COB-W) 
 
 
b. 
Should a parent put their children’s needs above their own, even if it means sacrificing their own 
happiness?  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
When looking for a partner we often go for someone like one of our parents, even if it’s not very 
comfortable for us.  (COB-W) 
In each of these examples the if-conditional represents a value that is particularly high (possibly the highest) 
on the even if-scale. In (956a) the values constituting the scale are conditionals whose if-clauses represent the 
various cases in which it might be thought that it is to a certain degree necessary for teachers to intervene in 
violent incidents. In (956b) the values are conditionals whose P-clauses describe situations which differ in 
the degree to which they require parents to put their children’s needs above their own. In (956c) the values 
are conditionals whose P-clauses refer to situations in which it is possible that we would choose a partner 
who resembles one of our parents. In all three examples, the position of the ‘if P, Q’ values on the even if-
scale is determined by the degree to which the proposition ‘P results in (or is compatible with) Q’ is seen as 
unlikely to be true. 
 
14.1.3. Even if precludes the implicature that P is necessary for Q 
 
As noted in section 12.4.2, ‘if P, Q’ often tends to be read as ‘Q if and only if P’ (=‘Q iff P’). This ‘necessity 
implicature’ (=‘conditional perfection’), which perfects ‘if P, Q’ into (‘if P, Q’ + ‘if not-P, not-Q’), i.e. ‘iff P, 
Q’ (=‘Q if and only if P’), can, like all implicatures, be cancelled. Thus, as we saw in 12.4.2, If the weather is 
fine, we’ll go to the seaside is easily perfected to give rise to the assumption ‘if the weather is not fine, we 
won’t go to the seaside’, that is, the condition of the weather being fine is seen as a necessary condition for 
our going to the seaside. Unlike if, does not permit the conditional perfection implicature. Compare: 
(957) 
a. 
Jane will help you if she has the time. 
 
 
b. 
Jane will help you even if she doesn’t have the time. 
(958) 
a. 
Jane won’t help you if she doesn’t have the time. 
 
 
b. 
Jane won’t help you even if she has the time. 
In each of the (a) examples, if is by implicature interpreted as ‘iff’. In each of the (b) sentences, this reading 
is blocked because the meaning of even if is incompatible with P being a necessary condition. (Note that we 
cannot add even to the (a) sentences without producing sentences that are pragmatically so odd as to be 
virtually nonsensical, e.g. ?Jane will help you even if she has the time. This is because the sense of expected 
incompatibility induced by even hardly fits in with the contents of the conditional to which even is added: our 
knowledge of the world tells us that having the time is not a very unlikely condition for helping someone but 
in fact virtually a necessary condition for doing so.) 

 
285
The reason why even blocks the ‘if and only if’ interpretation of implicative if-conditionals is that the ‘if 
and only if’ interpretation is incompatible with a scalar meaning: ‘even if P1, Q’ implies that there is at least 
one other value of the type ‘if P, Q’ on the even if-scale. 
 
14.2. Nonimplicative even if-conditionals 
 
As we explained in section 14.1, we refer to even if conditionals in which the if-clause which would remain if 
we removed even is actualization-conditioning or premise-expressing as ‘implicative’. The remaining even if 
conditionals we refer to as ‘nonimplicative’. Unlike implicative conditionals, nonimplicative even if-
conditionals do not express ‘contrary to expectations, P does not preclude Q’ and do not allow a scalar 
analysis. The following are some typical examples: 
(959) 
a. 
But they don’t really look like musicians, even if, occasionally, they sound like it.  (COB-W) (This is 
not interpreted as meaning that the conditional ‘They don’t really look like musicians if, occasionally, 
they sound like it’ is a value which contrasts with other conditionals on an ‘even if’-scale. That is, their 
sounding like musicians is not seen as a highly unexpected case in which they would not look like 
musicians.) 
 
 
b. 
But he is clever and a talented researcher even if, in parts of this passionately angry book, the talent is 
ill-used.  (COB-W) 
 
 
c. 
However one does appreciate that the job of prime minister is not one with a huge amount of long-term 
security, even if, once they have been removed from office, very few of them are actually to be seen 
queuing for Salvation Army soup.  (COB-W) 
 
 
d. 
[The appearance of three new books on the subject ... proves that,] even if philosophers want no part of 
the action, publishers know a good thing when they see it.  (TLS) 
These even if-conditionals can be subdivided into two groups: even if-conditionals with a ‘purely concessive’ 
P-clause and even if-conditionals in which the P-clause expresses some kind of comment on the Q-clause. 
 
14.2.1. Purely concessive even if-clauses 
 
(960) 
a. 
Even if we grant Allan Janik’s point that Weininger was an intense, sincere young man in search of a 
truly ‘moral science’, clearly something went badly wrong with his thought-experiment.  (TLS) 
 
 
b. 
[If by chance he does not kill me I shall be crippled for life.] Even if he fails to kill or cripple me I shall 
be permanently disfigured.  (LOB) 
 
 
c. 
[I did it because I think] I had the sheer gumption to get through and enjoy my life, even if it has taken 
me all this time to finally come to terms with the parts of myself I wasn’t too keen on.  (COB-W) 
Each of these sentences expresses something like ‘I (might) concede P, but still Q’ or ‘I (might) concede P, 
but that does not invalidate Q’. 
 
14.2.2. Commenting even if-clauses 
 
Commenting even if-clauses have already been discussed in section 10.3. Commenting P-clauses express the 
speaker’s comment on some aspect of the Q-clause—its contents, form, truth, presuppositions, etc. Since the 
possible commenting functions of even if-clauses were treated in detail in section 10.3, we can confine 
ourselves here to a brief look at a couple of examples: 
(961) 
a. 
She spoke to him clearly even if somewhat bluntly.  (Barker 1994: 254) 
 
 
b. 
Women have always kissed women, even if more cynical males describe the process as being 
reminiscent of prize fighters shaking hands.  (Barker 1994: 254) 
Sentence (961a) expresses little more than 
(962) She spoke to him clearly. She did so somewhat bluntly. 
except that the use of even in (961a) adds the idea of expected incompatibility. This means that P represents 
some sort of (at least potential) detraction from the validity of Q (or of uttering Q). This aspect of meaning 
explains why the coordination of two manner adverbials (e.g. clearly and bluntly) by means of even if is only 
acceptable if the two ideas expressed can be expected to be incompatible with each other: 

 
286
(963) 
a. 
She spoke to him clearly {and / *even if} at just the right volume.  (‘Even if’ is odd because there is no 
easily imaginable incompatibility between clarity of speech and speech at just the right volume.) 
 
 
b. 
She spoke to him clearly {and / even if} somewhat {loudly / quietly}.  (‘Even if’ is all right if we 
interpret ‘loudly / quietly’ as ‘too loudly / quietly’, in other words if ‘loudly / quietly’ are understood as 
detracting to a certain extent from the positive evaluation in ‘she spoke clearly’.)17 
 
 
c. 
He spoke brutally, even if {*kindly / *slowly / ??clearly / honestly}.  (‘Brutally’ and ‘kindly’ cannot be 
seen as compatible; ‘slowly’ and ‘clearly’ simply cannot [at least, not without great difficulty] be made 
relevant as manners of speech that might be seen [potentially] to detract from the brutality of 
someone’s speech; but ‘honestly’ is something positive that can be set against the negative ‘brutally’.) 
In (961b), the even if-clause has a similar commenting function. It is therefore equivalent to 
(964) 
Women have always kissed women. More cynical males describe the process as being reminiscent of prize 
fighters shaking hands. 
except that even in (961b) adds the idea of expected incompatibility. This means that (961b) differs from 
(964) in that it expresses a connection between the two clauses, viz. that P might be thought by some to 
detract from (the validity, felicity, etc. of) Q but in the speaker’s view does not. 
As we saw in chapter 10, commenting even if-clauses may have a ‘downtoning’ connotation. They may 
also be ‘evaluating’, i.e. either ‘truth-evaluating’, ‘content-evaluating’ or ‘presupposition-evaluating’. The 
reader is referred to section 10.3 for more detail on these functional types. 
 
14.3. Conclusion 
 
The following are the main findings of the brief discussion above: (a) It is (part of) the invariant meaning of 
even that this focusing adverb evokes a sense of ‘expected incompatibility’; (b) In ‘implicative even if-
conditionals’ (=those in which the corresponding if-conditional is interpreted as ‘P leads to Q’) this sense of 
expected incompatibility manifests itself as a combination of an expectation understanding (‘One might 
expect P to preclude Q’) and a nonpreclusive understanding (‘P does not preclude Q’); (c) In implicative 
even if-conditionals, even evokes an even if-scale which is a scale of improbability and whose values are if-
conditionals, ordered from low (=least unlikely) to high (=most unlikely); (d) Because the values on the even 
if-scale are conditional sentences, implicative even if-conditionals are truly conditionals: they express a 
conditional relation between P and Q; (e) In quite a few cases this relation does not hold between P and the 
overt Q-clause but rather between P and a covert Q. In that case the overt Q-clause is a ‘pseudo-Q-clause’ 
which is actually interpreted as an adverbial clause of reason; (f) The range of values on the even if-scale 
may be determined by the range of propositional values on an ancillary scale of P-propositions, which may 
itself depend on another scale; (g) Even blocks the necessity implicature (‘conditional perfection’) which is 
very often invited by implicative conditionals; (h) Nonimplicative even if-conditionals still have a sense of 
expected incompatibility but lack the expectation understanding and the nonpreclusive understanding, as well 
as the scalarity, which are typical of implicative even if-conditionals; (i) We can distinguish two classes of 
nonimplicative even if-conditionals: those in which the P-clause is purely concessive and those in which it 
expresses some kind of comment on the contents, truth, presuppositions, etc. of the Q-clause. 
                                              
17 The version with and may seem a little odd, but if it is interpreted as purely descriptive, say as an answer to a policeman 
wanting the exact description of how she spoke, it seems quite acceptable.

Glossary 
 
 
 
Note: the words underlined figure as separate entries in the glossary. 
 
Absolute sectors: cover-term for the past time-sphere, the pre-present (sector), the 
present (sector) and the post-present (sector). 
Absolute tense: tense which locates an STO (=the time of a situation) in one of the 
absolute sectors and in doing so relates it directly to the temporal zero-point. For 
example: I did it; I have done it; I’m doing it; I’ll do it. 
Absolute-relative tense: tense which combines the expression of the meaning of an 
absolute tense with the expression of a temporal relation in a temporal domain (see 
relative tense). Typical examples are the future perfect (e.g. will have left) and tenses built 
with have been going to, will have been going to or will be going to. 
A-condition: condition for the actualization of the situation referred to in the Q-clause 
Action: type of situation: an action is a dynamic situation performed by a conscious 
agent (e.g. I read a book). 
Actual world: possible world that is the real world, i.e. the world in which things are the 
way they are in the real world as we know it. 
Actualization: cover-term for the performance of an action, the taking place of a process, 
the holding of a state or the happening of an event. In all four cases we can speak of the 
‘actualization’ of a situation. 
Actualization conditional: conditional expressing that the actualization of the P-
situation is a condition for the actualization of the Q-situation. The P-clause (or, more 
correctly, the P-situation) can be referred to as actualization-conditioning, the Q-clause 
(or rather the Q-situation) as actualization-conditioned. We distinguish between several 
types of actualization conditional, according to whether the P-clause is actualization-
triggering (e.g. If it rains we’ll stay at home), actualization-licensing (e.g. I could open the 
door if I had the key), preclusive (e.g. If it rains, we won’t go to the seaside), nonpreclusive 
(e.g. If it rains, we’ll still go to the seaside) or an in case-clause. (In this last case, it is the 
anticipation of the actualization of the P-situation, rather than the actualization itself, 
that triggers the actualization of the Q-situation.) 
Actualization-conditioned Q-clause: Q-clause of actualization condi-     tional. 
Actualization-conditioning P-clause: P-clause of actualization condi-     tional. 
Actualization-licensing-P conditional: actualization conditional in which the P-clause 
is actualization-conditioning in a relatively weak sense: instead of being seen as causing 
(triggering) or preventing the Q-situation, the P-situation is seen as merely enabling or 
permitting the Q-situation to actualize (e.g. I could open the door if I had the key.) 
Actualization-precluding-P conditional: see preclusive-P (actualization) conditional 
Actualization-triggering-P conditional: actualization conditional in which the P-clause 
is actualization-triggering, i.e. the actualization of the P-situation is seen as triggering 
(causing) the actualization of the Q-situation. (e.g. If it rains we’ll stay at home) 
Actualize: verb used as cover term for the predicates that are typically associated with 
the four types of situation. If we wish to avoid having to specify whether a clause 

 
290
expresses the performance of an action, the happening of an event, the development of a 
process or the existence of a state, we can say that the clause in question expresses the 
actualization of a situation. 
Ad absurdum conditional: type of indirect inferential conditional: If that’s true, I’m a 
Dutchman! The speaker expects the hearer to draw an inference from the pragmatically 
obvious nontruth of Q to the speaker’s rejection of the truth of P. This kind of conditional 
exhibits a kind of reasoning (‘P must be as absurd as Q’) which is similar to the ‘reductio 
ad absurdum’ argument in mathematics, which disproves a theorem by showing that it 
leads to absurd consequences. 
Alternative-P conditional: conditional with two coordinated P-clauses expressing 
disjunctive conditions, but interpreted as ‘both if A and if B’ (e.g. You will be operated on, 
whether you want it or not). 
Anacoluthon: sentence which is syntactically ‘incorrect’ because it is the result of 
blending two different syntactic constructions (e.g. What he did was he hit me in the 
face). 
Anchoring-P conditional: subtype of rhetorical conditional in which the main, or even 
only, function of the P-clause is to anchor the Q-clause into the ongoing discourse. For 
example: [Lewis is not known to have a girl-friend, and] if he does he’s not telling. 
Apodosis: the Q-clause of a conditional. Some people use the term in connection with 
inferential conditionals only, others in connection with case-specifying conditionals, and 
still others in connection with any conditional of the form ‘if P, (then) Q’. Because of this, 
the term is not used in this book. 
Assertion: an utterance-type, also called ‘statement’, which typically corresponds with 
the formal category ‘declarative sentence’ 
Assertive: A clause is assertive when the message (but not necessarily the form) of the 
clause is that of an affirmative assertion. Otherwise (i.e. when the message is negative 
and/or interrogative) it is nonassertive. Only nonassertive clauses can contain 
nonassertive items (‘negative polarity items’). A negative assertion like I didn’t lift a finger 
to help him is assertoric but nonassertive—hence the use of the nonassertive item lift a 
finger. 
Assertive item: word or expression (often also called ‘positive polarity item’) which can 
appear in assertive statements only, i.e. which cannot occur (except, sometimes, 
echoically) within the scope of a negation or interrogative (e.g. ‘far from + adjective’: He {is 
/ *isn’t} far from satisfied). 
Assertoric: A clause is assertoric if it realizes the illocutionary act of making an 
assertion. A question is assertoric (i.e. makes an assertion) in the following cases: (a) if it 
is a rhetorical question, i.e. a sentence that has the form of a question but is interpreted 
as a forceful statement; (b) if it is a declarative question (i.e. a declarative sentence with 
an interrogative meaning, e.g. You’re his father?), and (c) if it is a ‘yes / no-question’ 
(polar interrogative) which is interpreted as an assertion followed by a question tag 
asking for confirmation, e.g. Is he your leader, then? 
Asyndetic paratactic conditional: paratactic conditional that is asyndetic, i.e. in which 
the (often elliptic) clauses are not linked by a conjunction (e.g. No work, no money.; Name 
your price, you’ll get it). 
Backshifting: change of tense forms when there is a shift from a present time-sphere 

 
291
temporal domain to a past time-sphere temporal domain. For example, Has he done it? is 
‘backshifted’ to had he done it in indirect reported speech after a verb in the past tense: I 
wondered if he had done it. The speaker can also use backshifting for various other 
reasons, e.g. for tentativeness: {Will / would} you please help me? 
Backtracker: conditional that is a direct inferential and in which the Q-situation 
precedes the P-situation (e.g. If John did the burglary, it will have been carefully 
prepared). 
Basic TO (abbreviation: TO1): that TO (=time of orientation) in the structure of the tense 
from which the temporal relations expressed by the tense begin to be computed. In most 
cases TO1 is the temporal zero-point (t0) (e.g. He has done it), but there are cases in 
which it is a post-present binding TO which is treated as if it were t0 (e.g. [If Jim does it] 
he will have to admit to his wife that he has done it). In both examples the present perfect 
form has done locates the STO (=the time of the situation of Jim’s doing it) before the 
basic TO. In the first example this TO1 is t0; in the      second it is a post-present STO 
(=the time of admitting) which is treated as if it were t0. (See also Present Perspective 
System.) 
Bi-conditional: see conditional perfection 
Binding: see temporal binding 
Boosting-P conditional: commenting-P rhetorical conditional in which the (often elliptic) 
P-clause boosts the meaning of some constituent of the Q-clause by suggesting that a 
claim made in Q might be made even more strongly (e.g. He is one of the best students, if 
not the BEST, that we have ever had). 
Boosting 
presupposition-evaluating-P 
conditional: 
presupposition-evaluating-P 
conditional whose P-clause has a boosting effect. For example: Use pesticides sparingly, if 
at all. (Using pesticides sparingly presupposes the use of pesticides; the P-clause cancels 
this presupposition. In doing so it is boosting, because ‘not at all’ would be less than 
‘sparingly’ and the message is to use as little as possible. 
Boosting-Q conditional: gradation-expressing conditional in which the Q-proposition is 
stronger than the P-proposition (e.g. If I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor). 
Canonical conditional: see canonical pattern of conditional 
Canonical pattern: On the basis of their form (viz. the use of tenses and certain special 
modal auxiliaries), we can distinguish between three ‘canonical’ patterns of conditionals: 
 
Pattern 1: If she comes I will tell her everything. 
 
Pattern 2: If she came I would tell her everything. 
 
Pattern 3: If she had come I would have told her everything. 
We do not distinguish between the patterns on the basis of the meaning(s) which they 
can have. The only criterion is the form of the conditional. 
Case-specifying-P conditional: conditional whose P-clause specifies a case or the 
case(s) in which the Q-situation actualizes or in which the Q-proposition is asserted to be 
true. Within the class of case-specifying-P conditionals we can distinguish the following 
subtypes: purely case-specifying-P conditionals (e.g. If I was thirsty I could buy myself a 
drink in the canteen), actualization conditionals (e.g. If he comes here, I will tell him off) 
and direct inferentials (e.g. If Bill has an alibi, he can’t be the culprit). 
Central TO (central time of orientation): the STO (=time of the situ-ation) referred to 
by a tense which creates a temporal domain, and which possibly serves as binding TO for 
other STOs that are incorporated into the domain. For example, in I knew that Tom 

 
292
hadn’t seen the film yet and would want to go and see it, the central TO is the STO of [I] 
knew. 
Cleft (sentence): specificational sentence of the form ‘It + be + value constituent + wh-
clause’ in which the wh-clause expresses the variable to which a value is given, e.g. It 
was John who did it. (This is interpreted as ‘the x who did it was: John’.) 
Closed P-clause: an echoic P-clause expressing a condition which the speaker treats as 
assumed to be fulfilled in the actual world (e.g. If, as you say, you can’t accompany me 
tonight, I’ll have to look for someone else). 
Closed P-conditional: conditional with an closed P-clause 
Closed P-world: possible P-world which the speaker (sometimes osten-    sibly) treats as 
assumed to be the actual world 
Commenting Q-clause: the Q-clause of a commenting-Q conditional 
Commenting-Q conditional: rhetorical conditional in which Q comments on P or on a 
constituent of the P-clause (e.g. If this is a publicity stunt, it’s extremely succesful). 
Communicative function: the communicative function of a conditional is the message 
that a particular type of conditional may be used to convey in discourse (e.g. giving 
advice, as in If I were you, I wouldn’t accept this invitation). 
Comparative conditional: conditional of the type The more we work, the less / more we 
earn. 
Comparing conditional: rhetorical conditional which expresses similarity (e.g. If you can 
answer the phone, so can I), gradation (e.g. If you think Pete’s children are badly behaved, 
you should see Diana’s twins) or contrast (e.g. If a few minutes earlier it had been John 
who protested, it was now the turn of his mistress) between the P-situation and the Q-
situation, or whose P-clause has a concessive meaning (e.g. If he is not rich, at least he 
isn’t poor). 
Concessive-P conditional: if-clause expressing a concessive rather than purely 
conditional meaning (e.g. If he is poor, at least he’s not unem-     ployed). 
Conditional: This term is short for conditional sentence, i.e. a combination of a 
conditional clause (P-clause) and a head clause (Q-clause). 
Conditional perfection: the phenomenon that a conditional expressing ‘If P, Q’ is often 
interpreted as a ‘bi-conditional’, i.e. as expressing both ‘if P, Q’ and ‘if not-P, not-Q’. 
When a conditional is thus ‘perfected’ into a bi-conditional, if is by implicature 
interpreted as ‘if and only if’ (e.g. You will be punished if you do that). This implicature 
can also be called the ‘necessity implicature’, because it leads to the understanding that 
a given suf-   ficient condition is interpreted as also being a necessary condition. 
Conditional sentence: sentence consisting of a conditional clause (P-clause) and a head 
clause (Q-clause). 
Conditioned denial: conditional expressing a negation or denial of [+q] under condition 
P. One subtype is when the negator has wide scope over q. In that case not negates 
neither p nor the relation (e.g. inference) between p and q. (Thus, both If she’s there, he 
{can’t be / isn’t} far away and He {can’t be / isn’t} far away if she’s there are interpreted 
as ‘[+p] leads us to infer [–q]’.) In a second subtype, the negator (not / never) in the Q-
clause has narrow scope over a particular (accented) constituent of the Q-clause, which 
is therefore automatically interpreted specificationally, and hence contrastively. For 
example: BILL won’t help you if you need help [but JOHN will]. (This is interpreted as ‘If you 

 
293
need help, it’s not Bill who will help you [but John].’) 
Constituent negation: narrow scope negation; negation which has only one constituent 
of the clause in its scope (e.g. I told her nothing about it; It wasn’t John who was 
responsible) 
Content-evaluating-P conditional: subtype of evaluating-P rhetorical conditional in 
which the P-clause expresses the speaker’s comment on the semantic content of the Q-
clause (e.g. But are there things here that are just plain valuable, if you know what I 
mean?). 
Content question: see wh-question 
Contrastive conditional: type of comparing conditional in which the speaker expresses 
dissimilarity between the P-situation and the Q-situation (or between participants in the 
situations) and affirms her belief that the Q-situation has the same degree of factuality 
as the P-situation. For example: If I’ve had a succesful career, I’ve been a complete failure 
as far as my private life is concerned. 
Cosubordination: the phenomenon that a two-clause sentence contains neither a head 
clause nor a subordinate clause, i.e. neither clause is independent, but neither is part of 
the other (e.g. The more I work, the more I earn). 
Counterfactual P-clause: P-clause referring to a possible world which is assumed by the 
speaker to be different from (incompatible with) the actual world. The speaker treats P 
(and, by implicature, Q) as false in the real world, i.e. as contrary to past or present fact. 
For example: 
 
I would have been extremely happy if I had got a first.  (is understood as:     ‘I did not get a 
first’ + ‘I {was / am} not happy’ 
 
My life would be easier if I had a car.  (is understood as: ‘I don’t have a car’ + ‘My life is not as 
easy as it would be if I had a car’) 
Counterfactual-P conditional: theoretical conditional with a counterfac-  tual P-clause 
(e.g. I would have been happy if she had come). 
Counterfactual world: possible world which is assumed by the speaker to be different 
from (incompatible with) the actual world. 
Counteridentical-P conditional: counterfactual-P conditional in which the P-clause 
identifies two incompatible entities with each other (e.g. If I were you...; If Bill had been 
Susan...). 
Covert condition: condition recoverable from a covert P-clause 
Covert P-clause: P-clause expressing a condition which is neither overtly expressed nor 
implicit in one of the constituents of the conditional. For example: I COULD answer that 
question. (=I could answer that question {if I wanted to / if it was put to me / etc.}.) 
Covert-P conditional: conditional with a covert P-clause 
Covert-Q conditional: conditional with a covert Q-clause (=Q-less conditional) 
Covert Q-clause: Q-clause which is neither overtly expressed nor implicit in one of the 
constituents of the conditional. For example: If the gentleman would come in now? 
Declarative sentence: statement, assertion 
Declarative question: sentence that combines the form (word order) of a declarative 
sentence with an interrogative meaning (e.g. You’re his father?) 
Denied conditional: conditional with metalinguistic (external) negation in the Q-clause. 

 
294
Such a conditional is typically echoic, and the negation in the Q-clause denies a 
statement or suggestion to the contrary. For example: [“Kate’ll be happy if you offer to 
help her.”] — “She’ll NOT be happy if I offer to help her. [She’ll know her boy-friend will be 
jealous.”] This conditional is interpreted as ‘It’s not true that she’ll be happy if I offer to 
help her’, i.e. as ‘NOT “if [+p], then [+q]”‘. That is, not has scope over the en-tire 
conditional and therefore over the relation between P and Q: the conditional expresses 
that my offering to help Kate will not entail her being     happy. In other words, not 
negates the relation between P (the speaker’s offer of help) (=[+p]) and Q (Kate’s 
happiness) (=[+q]), rather than negating Q (or P) alone. 
Deontic necessity: nonepistemic necessity, i.e. the necessity of actualization of a 
situation (rather than of the truth of a proposition) 
Direct inferential: inferential conditional in which the truth of Q is inferred from the 
truth of P 
Directive: imperative, or statement expressing deontic necessity on the part of the 
hearer 
Direct inferential: conditional whose P-clause expresses a premise and the Q-clause 
asserts the conclusion drawn from it. A direct inferential represent a process of reasoning 
of the type ‘If P is true, Q is true’ in which the P-clause is premise-expressing and the Q-
clause asserts the conclusion which the speaker draws from P. (The conclusion is based 
not only on P but also on contextual or pragmatic knowledge shared by the speaker or 
hearer. However, P is the most relevant premise in the discourse, as it is the only one 
that is explicitly mentioned.) (e.g. If he has not arrived yet, he must have had an accident. 
The conclusion here concerns the epistemic necessity of the truth of Q.) 
Direct reported speech (DRS): reported speech in which the reported utterance or 
thought is not reported in the form of a subordinate clause (e.g. He said that he was ill) 
but is quoted as an independent sentence (as in He said: ‘I am ill.’). 
Displaced-P conditional: conditional in which the P-clause is not added to the Q-clause 
but to the head clause governing the Q-clause (e.g. If it all works, we hope the Council will 
feel obliged to continue it). 
Domain: see temporal domain. 
Double pluperfect: the form ‘had + perfect infinitive’, which is sometimes found in the P-
clause of a conditional of pattern 3 (e.g. Had he have lost this frame, it would have been 
all over for him). 
Downtoning-P conditional: commenting-P rhetorical conditional in which the 
(sometimes elliptic) P-clause tones down, or casts doubt on, a claim made or implied in Q 
(e.g. He’ll no doubt be late, if he turns up at all;  There seemed to be few, if any, students 
that could follow his lecture). 
Downtoning-Q conditional: gradation-expressing conditional in which a claim made or 
implied in the Q-proposition is a weakened version of a claim made or implied in the P-
proposition (e.g. If he didn’t commit ALL these murders, he certainly committed the last 
three). 
DRS: abbreviation of indirect reported speech 
Epistemic: Epistemic modality is modality having to do with (the possible degrees of) the 
truth of a proposition. For example, This must be the        answer! expresses epistemic 
necessity, while This cannot be the answer! expresses epistemic impossibility (which can 

 
295
also, of course, be seen as epistemic necessity). Epistemic modality can be expressed by 
modal adverbs like certainly, perhaps, possibly, etc. or by auxiliaries like must, should, 
ought to, will and need. 
All inferential conditionals are epistemic, but not vice versa. If the Q-clause is a 
question containing an epistemic auxiliary (e.g. If he’s not at home, need that mean he’s 
in the pub?), the conditional is not a direct inferential, except if the interrogative Q-clause 
is interpreted as a rhetorical question, i.e. as assertoric. A conditional is a direct 
inferential only if the P-clause expresses a premise and the Q-clause asserts the 
conclusion drawn from it. 
Evaluating-P conditional: subtype of commenting-P rhetorical conditional in which the 
P-clause expresses the speaker’s comment on the content of the Q-clause. This comment 
represents a kind of evaluation of what is said in the Q-clause. According to the nature of 
the comment, we can distinguish between truth-evaluating-P conditionals (e.g. If we’re to 
believe Mary, Joan’s pregnant), content-evaluating-P conditionals (e.g. But are there 
things here that are just plain valuable, if you know what I mean?) and presupposition-
evaluating-P conditionals (e.g. In retrospect, the linkage, if there was one, appeared so 
very obvious). 
Event: type of situation: an event is a situation which is dynamic (i.e. not a state) and 
which is not performed by a conscious agent but just happens (e.g. The balloon burst). 
Evidential P-clause: P-clause of a truth-evaluating-P rhetorical conditional which refers 
to the source and/or strength of the evidence (in the sense of ‘authority’, not ‘premise’) 
on which the Q-statement is based. Such a P-clause represents the truth of Q as relative 
to the degree of dependability of the authority (source) in question (e.g. If we’re to believe 
Mary, Joan’s pregnant). 
Exclusive reference: There is exclusive reference when the predication applies to other 
entities besides the one(s) referred to, i.e. that other entities are excluded from the 
reference. For example, focusing adverbs like even, especially, etc. have this 
‘exclusiveness understanding’ as part of their       semantics. Thus, {Even / especially} 
John protested implies that there was at least one other person who protested, but who is 
not included in the    reference of {even / especially} John.) If the focusing adverb is 
added to a P-clause, the ‘exclusiveness understanding’ is that the condition mentioned 
(viz. P) is not the only condition for Q. Indefinite noun phrases also have an 
exclusiveness understanding: in A thief broke in last night, the NP a thief implicates that 
there are other thieves besides the one that is included in the reference. 
Exclusiveness understanding: see exclusive reference 
Exhaustiveness implicature: implicature that is conventionally attached to a 
specificational sentence. It says that, unless indicated otherwise, the        value(s) 
specified for the variable must constitute the complete set (exhaustive list) of values 
actually satisfying the variable. Thus, What he gave me was a book implicates that a 
book represents the exhaustive list of        values, i.e. that the book in question was the 
ONLY thing he gave me (in the pragmatic context under discussion). Similarly, It was John 
and Bill who escaped implicates that John and Bill were the only ones that escaped. 
Exhaustiveness understanding: see exhaustiveness implicature 
Expectation understanding: When even if introduces a P-clause, or when the Q-clause 
contains an adversative adverb like still, nonetheless, etc., the conditional normally 
evokes two understandings: an ‘expectation understanding’ and a ‘nonpreclusive 

 
296
understanding’. For example, Even if it rains, the match will be played evokes the 
expectation understanding ‘One might expect that rain would prevent the match being 
played’, as well as the nonpreclusive understanding ‘[In fact] rain will not prevent the 
match being played’. 
External negation: negation with scope over the entire clause or sentence, as in These 
spiders are not dangerous (=it is not the case that these spiders are dangerous). See also 
metalinguistic negation. 
Extrapolating inferential: inferential conditional in which the speaker extrapolates from 
a general truth to a specific instantiation. For example: If the Red Sox have won, the team 
they were playing against have lost. (The general truth underlying this inferential is an 
exclusive disjunction. Since in basket-ball there are only two possibilities [‘A have won’ 
and ‘B have won’], the following conditionals must both be true: (a) If A have won, B have 
lost; (b) If A have lost, B have won. The Red Sox example is a conditional of type (a). Its Q 
is therefore necessarily true.) 
Extraposed clause: subject or object clause which is moved to the end of the sentence 
and is replaced in its original position by it (e.g. It is true that he is ill). 
Extraposed-P conditional: conditional whose P-clause is an extraposed clause (e.g. It 
doesn’t matter if he’s poor). 
Factual P-clause: P-clause referring to a situation that forms part of the actual world 
(i.e. its present state and history) (e.g. If I had a problem, I always went to my 
grandmother). 
Factual-P conditional: conditional with a factual P-clause 
Factual world: possible world that is the actual world, i.e. the world in which things are 
the way they are in the real world as we know it. 
FIS: abbreviation of free indirect speech 
Focalizing when-clause: when-clause which does not specify the time of the head clause 
situation (or a time to which the time of the head clause situation is related) but 
expresses the speaker’ focus on a time of evaluation or observation. In one subtype, the 
when-clause suggests the idea of a travelling observing consciousness (e.g. When you 
travel to Washington, Boston, Chicago or New York, the same problems exist), in another, 
the focalizing when-clause indicates the ‘epistemic time of evaluation’, i.e. the time when 
the conclusion is reached that the statement made in the head clause is true (e.g. When 
you look at the economics, this company needs a Japanese and a European partner to 
make it work). 
Focusing conditional: see specificational conditional 
FPS: see Future Perspective System 
Free indirect speech (FIS): form of indirect reported speech in which the reported 
utterance or thought is reported in the form of a subordinate clause which is, however, 
syntactically independent (e.g. [He took her threat seri-ously.] She would not hesitate to 
carry it out). In FIS there is no reporting clause. 
Full situation: the complete situation as it actualizes in whatever possible world is being 
referred to. The full situation should be distinguished from the predicated situation. The 
latter is that part of the full situation (possibly all of it) about which a claim is made in 
the sentence. As is clear from Two minutes ago John was in the library (which does not 
exclude that John is still there), it is the predicated situation rather than the full 

 
297
situation that is located in time by the use of a particular tense. 
Fully integrated P-clause: see integrated subclause 
Futurate present tense: present tense that can be used in an independent clause to 
refer to the post-present. The simple (=nonprogressive) futurate express that the post-
present situation is seen as completely predetermined, and hence as inevitable (e.g. The 
fair opens next Sunday). The progressive present tense can be used similarly to refer to 
an ‘rranged future’ (e.g. We’re leaving tomorrow). 
Future Perspective System: system of tense forms used to establish a (new) domain in 
the post-present sector. This system comprises the future tense (e.g. I {will / shall} 
probably be there), other forms of locating an STO (=time of a situation) in the post-
present (e.g. I’m going to do it) and absolute-relative tenses such as the future perfect or 
tenses built with will have been going to or will be going to. 
Gradation conditional: see gradation-expressing conditional 
Gradation-expressing conditional: type of comparing conditional which expresses a 
difference of gradation (similar to the comparative or superla-tive degrees of adjectives). 
For example: If you think Pete’s children are badly behaved, you should see Diana’s twins. 
Gricean Maxims: four principles of conversation, described by Grice (1991), that are 
conventionally observed by cooperative speakers and      hearers, and which can trigger 
implicatures. 
Habit: situation that is characteristic of the referent of the subject noun phrase for an 
extended period of time (e.g. John smokes; Bill mostly walks to work). Because it is a 
characteristic, a habit is by definition a state. It does not necessarily involve repetition 
(e.g. Sue used to be afraid of mice). 
Head clause of a conditional: the Q-clause (which may be a subordinate clause or an 
independent clause) 
Hedge: device for toning down the speaker’s responsibility for the assertion made in the 
Q-clause or for rendering this assertion more tentative, diplomatic, polite (e.g. I think 
[you’re mistaken]; Could I just say that...) 
Hedging-P conditional: subtype of commenting-P rhetorical conditional in which the P-
clause is used as a hedge (e.g. If I am not mistaken, Paris is the capital of France; If I may 
say so, I don’t think he is at all to be trusted). 
Heterogeneous situation: A situation is represented as heterogeneous if the clause 
representing it can only be used to refer to the full situation, not to refer to parts of that 
situation (e.g. I read your letter yesterday). 
Homogeneous noun phrase: noun phrase that can name not only a whole set or mass 
but also parts of that set or mass. For example, we can use the noun phrase (some) bears 
to refer to the whole of a particular group of bears, but we can also use it to refer to, say, 
half of that group. Similarly, milk is a homogeneous noun phrase because any portion of 
milk can also be referred to as milk. 
Homogeneous situation: A situation is represented as homogeneous if the clause 
representing it can be used not only to refer to the full situation but also to refer to parts 
of that situation (e.g. I was at home {at 5 p.m. / from 2 to 5 p.m.}). 
Hypothetical: This term is avoided in this book because it is used in too many different 
senses in the linguistic (and philosophical) literature. See tentative, theoretical. 
Iff: conventional linguistic abbreviation of ‘if and only if’. 

 
298
Imaginary conditional: see imaginary-P conditional 
Imaginary P-clause: subtype of neutral theoretical P-clause; the P-clause has an irrealis 
meaning, and the conditional (which is formally indistinguishable from a counterfactual 
conditional) normally requires a counterfactual context, e.g. [{In your place / If I had been 
you}] I wouldn’t have replied if he had addressed me. An imaginary P-clause is an irrealis 
P-clause which presupposes nothing about the truth or nontruth of P in the actual 
world. 
Imaginary-P conditional: subtype of neutral theoretical conditional, with an imaginary 
P-clause. For example: In your place I would have been happy if I had got a first. (This 
conditional presupposes neither ‘I did not get a first’ nor ‘I got a first’.) In an imaginary-P 
conditional, the Q-clause is also interpreted as imaginary. 
Imaginary Q-conditional: conditional in which Q is imaginary while P is counterfactual 
(e.g. If I had your genes, I would have curly hair. Here the P-clause is counterfactual—I do 
not have your genes—but the Q-clause is imaginary: I may or may not have curly hair.) 
Imaginary world: possible world evoked by an imaginary P-clause or Q-clause. 
Implicate: to express an implicature 
Implicative conditional: conditional in which there is a kind of causal, resultative, 
licensing, preclusive or nonpreclusive link between P and Q or Q and P. Under this 
heading we can bring together the inferential condi-   tionals and the actualization 
conditionals. 
Implicature: aspect of interpretation which does not follow from the semantic meaning 
of a word, constituent or construction but results from the application of conversational 
principles, such as the Gricean Maxims. It is typical of implicatures that they can be 
blocked or cancelled by the context. For example, used to refers to a habit and implicates 
that this habit is over, but the implicature of ‘discontinued’ habit can be cancelled (e.g. 
At the time I used to smoke. In fact, I still do.) 
Implicit condition: condition that is not overtly expressed but is implicit in one of the 
constituents of the sentence, for example in a pro-form (e.g. [I think we should go home 
now.] Otherwise it will be dark before we get home. (‘otherwise’ = ‘if we don’t go’)), or in a 
nominal (e.g. That would be quite interesting. (‘that’ = ‘if that happened’, etc.)) 
Implicit P-clause: the P-clause corresponding with an implicit condition 
Implicit P-conditional: conditional with an implicit P-clause, such as In my days a lady 
would not have married a stable-boy. (=A lady would not have married a lad if that lad 
had been a stable-boy.) 
Implicit Q-clause: Q-clause that is not overtly expressed but implicit in a pro-form, as in 
“Will you come?” — “If John is there, no.” (where no implies ‘I will not come’). 
Implicit-Q conditional: conditional with implicit Q-clause 
Inclusive reference: reference to a set which implies or implicates reference to all the 
members of the set. For example, in I cleared away the glasses after party, the reference 
to the set of glasses is (by implicature) interpreted as reference to all the glasses of the 
relevant set. 
Inclusiveness implicature: implicature that definite noun phrases should be interpreted 
as having inclusive reference, i.e. as referring to all the members of the set denoted by 
the definite noun phrase. Thus, I’ve drunk the bottles of beer implicates that I have drunk 
all the bottles of beer in question. 

 
299
Indicative conditional: term which the authors of this book do not use (because it is too 
confusing), but which is used by some linguists and philosophers, who distinguish 
between ‘indicative’ conditionals and ‘sub-junctive’ or ‘counterfactual’ conditionals. In 
their terminology, an in-dicative conditional is one in which the tenses have their normal 
temporal meaning (e.g. I always punish him if he does something wrong) or which is of the 
type I’ll punish you if you do something wrong (where, strictly     speaking, the present 
tense does not have its normal temporal reference). Conditionals of the types I’d punish 
him if he did something wrong and I’d have punished him if he’d done something wrong 
are called ‘subjunctive’ or ‘counterfactual’. 
Indirect inferential: Whereas in direct inferential conditionals, P is the premise 
underlying an inference about the truth of Q, there are also in-ferentials where the 
inference goes from Q to P. The communicative pur-pose of such indirect inferentials is 
to make the hearer draw an inference about the truth of P. This inference is indirect in 
that the conclusion is not explicitly asserted, but is to be inferred from Q and the 
conditional sentence as a whole. More specifically, the reasoning is that P must be false 
because it is incompatible with a Q-proposition which the speaker treats as true, or 
because it is compatible with (i.e. belongs in the same possible world as) a Q-proposition 
which is patently false. Clear examples of such indirect in-ferentials are conditionals with 
an ostensibly closed P (e.g. If he’s so clever, why isn’t he rich?) and ad absurdum 
inferentials (e.g. If he is the general manager, I am Shakespeare!). 
Indirect reported speech (IRS): reported speech in which the reported utterance or 
thought is not quoted as an independent sentence (as in He said: “I am ill.”) but is 
reported in the form of a subordinate clause (e.g. He said that he was ill). 
Indirect tentative-P conditional: tentative-P conditional in which the      negation in 
the Q-clause is interpreted as bearing on the P-clause. For example: I wouldn’t be 
surprised if he came. (This receives much the same interpretation as I’d be surprised if he 
didn’t come.) 
Indispensable P-clause: P-clause that is necessary for the interpretability of the Q-
clause, i.e. without which the Q-clause is syntactically and semantically incomplete and 
not self-sufficient enough to be fully interpretable. An example is the P-clause of If he has 
a dog, he will look after it well. 
Inferential: see inferential conditional 
Inferential bridge: a missing step in an inference. For example, in order to understand If 
today’s Tuesday Jim needs his boots, the addressee needs to be aware of a missing 
premise, e.g. that on Tuesdays Jim always has a walk in the woods. 
Inferential conditional: conditional expressing an inference from one proposition to 
another. (The latter proposition thus expresses an epistemically possible or necessary 
conclusion.) Unlike what we observe in actualization conditionals, the conditional link is 
not between the actualization of situ-ations but between the validity of propositions. We 
can distinguish between direct inferentials and indirect inferentials. (See also epistemic) 
Inferential it is that-construction: sentence beginning with it is that which expresses 
what the speaker thinks to be the correct explanation or interpretation of something that 
has happened or has been said, or of the fact that a speech act has taken place. For 
example: If there has been an explosion, it’s that the workers have not taken the necessary 
precautions. Or: [“Are you hungry?” — “No.”] — “It’s just that there’s plenty of food in the 
fridge, if you should feel hungry.”‘ 

 
300
Integrated subclause: subclause that is syntactically fully integrated into the head 
clause, i.e. which is not separated from the head clause by a break in intonation 
(represented by a dash or comma in the written mode). If a conditional clause is not 
integrated and follows its head clause, we call it a postscript P-clause. 
Intensional domain: a nonfactual world established by a future tense or by a verb like 
imagine, say, think, want, etc. An intensional domain is a domain of interpretation which 
has its own set of presuppositions and truth conditions, in terms of which propositions 
can be evaluated and interpreted. A ‘strong’ intensional domain (established by such 
verbs as imagine, fancy, etc.) always functions as a temporal domain. (For this reason we 
can say I thought he was taller, but not *I thought he is taller.) 
Internal speech / thought: We speak of ‘internal speech / thought’ when the speaker 
does not address anyone else, but speaks to herself, or when the sentence is the 
linguistic expression of a thought which does not lead to a real utterance. For example: If 
it’s 11 o’clock already, it’s high time I went to bed (which represents a mental conclusion 
drawn in a particular context, e.g. when the speaker hears the clock chiming 11). 
Inverted pseudo-cleft: pseudo-cleft in which the value constituent is processed as 
subject and the variable constituent as subject complement (e.g. A BOOK was what he 
gave me). 
Irrealis conditional: conditional which is not presented as possibly        matching the 
actual world. The possible world evoked by the P-clause may be either purely imaginary 
or counterfactual. A counterfactual conditional refers to a possible world which is 
presented as contrary to the actual world (e.g. I would have been angry if she had done 
that implies ‘she did not     do it’). An imaginary conditional refers to a world which is 
presented as existing in the imagination of the speaker only (and which the addressee is 
invited also to imagine). This means that it refers to a world which is not represented as 
being truth-conditionally related to the actual world. For example, In your place I would 
have been angry if she had done that does not imply ‘she did not do it’, but nor does it 
imply ‘She did it’. 
Irrealis world: possible world referred to by an irrealis conditional 
IRS: abbreviation of indirect reported speech (e.g. John said that he was ill). 
it-cleft: see cleft (sentence) 
Juxtaposition conditional: see asyndetic paratactic conditional 
Matrix (clause): the highest clause in the tree structure representing the syntactic 
structure of a multi-clause sentence. 
Metalinguistic negation: external negation, used to reject the truth of the sentence as a 
whole, i.e. to contradict a statement or implicature to the contrary. For example: [“The 
party was boring.”] — “The party was NOT       boring. [On the contrary, it was quite lively.”]’ 
Metalinguistic sentence: sentence that forms part of the language we use to speak 
about language (e.g. The sentence Whales are mammals is a generic sentence). 
Metalinguistic-P conditional: type of commenting-P rhetorical conditional in which the 
P-clause expresses a comment on the form of the Q-clause, on the choice of words in it, 
or on the pronunciation of a word (e.g. If I might borrow one of my son’s expressions, 
that’s a load of crap). 
Metalinguistic-Q conditional: type of utterance conditional in which the P-clause 
expresses a condition for uttering a metalinguistic Q-statement like I think, I reply, I 

 
301
argue, I concede, I conclude, I assume, I postulate, it means (that). For example: If he has 
murdered once, I {assume / think / conclude} he will murder again. Such sentences 
represent a hybrid form of conditional, since they are at the same time case-specifying-P 
conditionals (viz. inferentials or actualization conditionals) and utterance conditionals 
(which are rhetorical conditionals, the prototypical instances of which are purely non-
case-specifying-P). 
Necessity implicature: see conditional perfection 
Negative polarity item: see nonassertive item 
Neutral P-clause: theoretical P-clause which merely expresses a sup-position, without 
presupposing anything about the relation of compatibility between the supposed world 
and the actual world. Examples: 
 
If you need basics like saucepans, ironing boards and kettles, a department store may well be 
the place to start looking.  (COB-W) (presupposes neither ‘you need basics’ nor ‘you don’t need 
basics’) 
 
[“Has she ever got married?” — “ don’t know.] If she has, I’ve never been informed.”  
(presupposes neither ‘she has got married’ nor ‘she has not got married’) 
 
In your place I would have been happy if I had got a first.   (presupposes neither ‘I did not get 
a first’ nor ‘I got a first’) 
Neutral-P conditional: conditional with neutral P-clause 
Neutral P-world: P-world whose relation to the actual world is not specified or assumed. 
The P-world may or may not be the actual world (e.g. In your place I wouldn’t answer the 
telephone if John called me up. Nothing is said here about whether the speaker himself 
would answer the telephone if John called.) 
Nominal-Q conditional: conditional in which Q is expressed in the form of a 
nominalization (e.g. Imagine her embarrassment if I tell her this in front of the others.) 
Nonassertive: clause of which the message is not that of an affirmative assertion, i.e. the 
message is negative and/or interrogative. Only nonassertive clauses can contain 
nonassertive items (‘negative polarity items’). Thus, a negative assertion like I didn’t lift a 
finger to help him is assertoric but nonassertive—hence the use of the nonassertive item 
lift a finger. 
Nonassertive item: word or expression (often also called ‘negative polarity item’) which 
can appear in nonassertive clauses only (e.g. at all) 
Nonassertoric clause: clause that does not realize the illocutionary act     of making an 
assertion (statement) but expresses a directive or an open question. 
Nonassertoric-Q utterance conditional: cover term for those utterance conditionals 
that are not relevance conditionals and in which the Q-clause is not assertoric but a 
clause without a truth value, i.e. a nonassertoric question or a directive, such as an 
imperative or a statement of deontic      necessity (You must do it!). As in utterance 
conditionals generally, P          expresses what makes it possible or worthwhile for the 
speaker to utter the Q-clause. For example: If he’s so rich, why doesn’t he ever wear 
smart clothes?; If Kitty is really ill, don’t tell her anything about my troubles; If you’ve been 
feeling under the weather lately, you’d better see a doctor. 
Nonepistemic: Nonepistemic modality is modality that does not have to do with (the 
possible degrees of) the truth of a proposition but rather with the necessity of, possibility 
of, ability to, or permission for the actualization of a situation (e.g. You must leave now; 

 
302
Can I leave now?; I can read Japanese; Aerosols can explode). 
Nonextrapolating inferential: inferential conditional that is not an extrapolating 
inferential. 
Nonextraposed-semi-nominal-P conditional: conditional which differs from an 
extraposed-P conditional only in that the Q-clause does not involve a cataphoric it. For 
example: 
 
Do you mind if I smoke? (=If I smoke, do you mind my doing so?) 
 
If you need any help, just let me know. (=If you need any help, just let me know that you need 
help.) 
Nonfactual P-clause: see theoretical P-clause (=P-clause referring to a theoretical world) 
Nonfactual-P conditional: see theoretical-P conditional 
Nonfactual world: see theoretical world 
Noninclusive reference: way of referring to a set without including all the members of 
the set in the reference. For example, in The man who cleared away the glasses 
overlooked those on the window-sill, the reference to the set of glasses is noninclusive: 
the predication ‘clear away the glasses’ applies only to a subset of the glasses. 
Nonneutral P-clause: theoretical P-clause which expresses a supposition accompanied 
by an assumption (presupposition) about the relation of compatibility between the 
supposed world and the actual world. A nonneutral P-clause is either closed, open, 
tentative or counterfactual. 
Nonneutral P-conditional: conditional with a nonneutral P-clause, i.e. a theoretical P-
clause which is either closed, open, tentative or counter-    factual. 
Nonneutral P-world: possible world evoked by a nonneutral P-clause, i.e. a possible 
world which is not represented as being the same as the actual world nor a neutral P-
world, but a P-world which is conceived of as closed, open, tentative or counterfactual. 
Nonpreclusive-P (actualization) conditional: actualization conditional expressing the 
idea that the P-situation does not preclude (prevent) the Q-situation. To this class belong 
implicative even if-conditionals (e.g. Even if it rains we’ll go to the seaside) and 
conditionals with an adversative word like still in the Q-clause (e.g. If it rains, we’ll still go 
to the seaside). (Both examples are interpreted as ‘Rain will not preclude our going to the 
seaside’.) (See expectation understanding and nonpreclusive understanding). 
Nonpreclusive-P inferential: inferential conditional involving an even if-clause or a Q-
clause containing an adversative adverb like still, none-theless, etc. Such conditionals 
evoke an expectation understanding (‘One might expect Q not to be inferrable from P’) 
and a nonpreclusive understanding (‘The use of even, still, etc. does not preclude that Q 
is inferrable from P’). For example: [Judge Harris is a notorious racist.] If a black   
defendant is innocent, he is still likely to be convicted by him. 
Nonpreclusive understanding: When even if introduces a P-clause, or when the Q-
clause contains an adversative adverb like still, nonetheless, etc., the conditional 
normally evokes two understandings: an expectation understanding and a ‘nonpreclusive 
understanding’ For example, Even if it rains, the match will be played evokes the 
expectation understanding ‘One might expect that rain would prevent the match being 
played’, as well as the nonpreclusive understanding ‘[In fact] rain will not prevent the 
match being played’. 
Nonrestrictive postscript P-clause: postscript P-clause which does not have a 

 
303
restrictive meaning, i.e. which does not restrict the truth or applicability of the Q-clause 
a posteriori. For example: He can’t be a lawyer—if he lives in such a neighbourhood. 
Noun phrase: group of words clustering around a head which is a noun or a nominal 
(such as a pronoun or gerund). For example: the girl in the corner; something special; 
those who are afraid; that ruthless handling of the situation by Thatcher 
NP: abbreviation of noun phrase 
Opaque interpretation: interpretation in terms of a world which is not the speaker’s 
actual world. For example, in John believes that Paris is the   capital of Italy, the that-
clause is true in the intensional world of John’s belief, but not in (what the speaker 
knows to be) the actual world. That is, Paris is the capital of Italy is true when interpreted 
opaquely, but not when interpreted transparently (=in terms of the speaker’s actual 
world). 
Opaque noun phrase: noun phrase which does not refer to a particular individual, but 
refers to anyone satisfying the description (given by the noun phrase) at any time (e.g. the 
heir to the throne in The heir to the     throne cannot be a woman). 
Open P-clause: P-clause whose situation is assumed by the speaker to be one that may 
or may not actualize (or have actualized) in the real world. That is, the speaker treats 
fulfilment of the condition (supposition) as uncertain, but as a real possibility. For 
example: 
 
I will be happy if we find a solution. 
 
[I hope Liverpool won their home match yesterday.] If they did, they still have a chance of 
winning the championship. 
Open-P conditional: conditional with an open P-clause (e.g. If she comes, I will be 
delighted; [I don’t know if John did it, but] if he did he is an utter fool). 
Open P-world: possible world referred to or evoked by an open P-clause 
Open question: question asking for information which is unknown (or purported to be 
unknown) to the speaker (e.g. Who did this?; Is Ted at   home?). 
Ordinary modal auxiliary: In connection with P-clauses, we make a      distinction 
between ‘ordinary modals’, i.e. auxiliaries that can be used with the same meaning(s) in 
independent clauses, and ‘special P-modals’, which have a meaning in P-clauses that 
they do not have in other contexts. 
P: the proposition expressed in the P-clause (=conditional clause) of a conditional 
sentence 
#P: the proposition expressed in a #P-clause 
[+p]: positive (affirmative) P 
[–p]: negative P 
Paratactic conditional: construction which is interpreted as a conditional but in which 
the P-clause is coordinated with the Q-clause (rather than being syntactically 
subordinated to it). For example: Do it or I’ll punish you!; Do that and you will be fired!; 
One more step, and you’re a dead man! 
Past domain: temporal domain established in the past time-sphere 
Past subjunctive: type of mood. In English, the only possible past subjunctive form is 
were (e.g. If I were you, I wouldn’t do it). 
Past time-sphere: see time-sphere 

 
304
Pattern 1 conditional: conditional which has the form of canonical pattern 1: If she 
comes I will tell her everything. 
Pattern 2 conditional: conditional which has the form of canonical pattern 2: If she 
came I would tell her everything. 
Pattern 3 conditional: conditional which has the form of canonical pattern 3: If she had 
come I would have told her everything. 
P-clause: the conditional clause of a conditional sentence 
#P-clause: the clause expressing ‘not-P’ which is implied by a counter-factual P-clause. 
For example, the counterfactual P-clause If John had been here now... implies the #P-
clause John is not here now. 
Performative-Q conditional: type of utterance conditional in which P expresses the 
speaker’s reason for uttering a performative Q-statement: If that’s what you think of me, I 
advise you to change your attitude. 
Performative statement: statement in which the speaker reports a speech act which is 
actually performed by being reported. Thus, in I declare the meeting closed the speech act 
of declaring the meeting closed is performed by uttering the sentence. 
Pleonastic conditional: rhetorical conditional in which the Q-clause echoes the P-
clause, often in order to emphasize the inevitability of Q (e.g. If John won’t come, John 
won’t come. [So what?]). 
P-less conditional: conditional with covert P-clause 
Polar question: question which invites a yes or no answer (e.g. Was John present at the 
meeting?) 
Positive polarity item: see assertive item 
Possible P-world: Possible world referred to or evoked by the P-clause 
Possible world: way that things are or might be. The actual world is the way things 
actually are. A theoretical (nonfactual) world is an alternative way of conceptualizing 
things, such as the future world, the world of the imagination of the speaker, a 
counterfactual world, etc. Thus, Paris is the capital of France is true in the actual world, 
whereas the P-proposition If Paris had been the capital of Italy [the Pope would have been 
living there] is true in a counterfactual world. 
Possible-world typology of conditionals: classification of conditionals on the basis of 
the possible world that is created by the P-clause. The first cut is between factual and 
theoretical conditionals). The latter may be of five subtypes, according to whether the P-
clause is neutral, closed, open, ten-  tative or counterfactual. 
Post-present (sector): that part of (the speaker’s conceptualization of) the time-line that 
starts at the temporal zero-point and stretches out into the future. Thus, I will do it 
locates my ‘doing it’ in the post-present (sector). Because it begins at the temporal zero-
point, the post-present is one of the sectors of the present time-sphere. 
Postscript P-clause: P-clause which follows the Q-clause and is separated from it by a 
slight break (representable by a comma or dash). Such a P-clause is, syntactically, not 
fully integrated into the Q-clause but is offered as a ‘postscript’ or afterthought, as in I’ll 
come to you at five—if you will be alone. 
Postscript-P conditional: conditional with a postscript P-clause 
P-proposition: the proposition expressed in the P-clause (=conditional clause) of a 

 
305
conditional sentence 
#P-proposition: the proposition expressed in a #P-clause 
PPS: see Present Perspective System 
PR=AST: By ‘PR=AST’ we mean a past tense sentence or sequence in a novel or other 
kind of story which is by convention written or narrated in the past tense. Such a past 
tense sentence refers to the present of the novel, i.e. to a present (of a nonfactual world) 
which is represented as if it were past (in the real world). PR=AST is therefore short for 
‘PResent=pAST’. 
Precautionary-P conditional: subtype of in case-conditionals: the in case-clause 
expresses a contingent situation that the referent of the subject of the Q-clause is 
preparing for or taking precautions against, e.g. In those days Joe always carried an 
umbrella in case it rained. Strictly speaking, one can say that rain was not a condition for 
Joe’s carrying an umbrella, but that the possibility or prospect of rain was the motivation 
for his doing so. 
Preclusive-P (actualization) conditional: type of actualization conditional which 
expresses that the P-situation prevents (precludes) the Q-situation (e.g. If it rains, we 
won’t go to the seaside (=rain will preclude our going to the seaside).) In one type of in 
case-conditional the P-clause is preclusive (e.g. She locked the door of her room in case 
anyone should enter it [while she was away].) 
Preclusive-P inferential: type of inferential conditional which expresses that P prevents 
(precludes) the conclusion that Q (e.g. If John paid Kitty’s debts, no one else can have 
done. The idea here is that premise P allows no other conclusion than [–q].) 
Predicated situation: that part of a situation (possibly all of it) that is        located in 
time by a tense form. In Five minutes ago John was in the         kitchen the predicated 
situation is that part of the situation that is rep-resented as temporally coinciding with 
the time indicated by five minutes ago. The full (=complete) situation may take up a much 
longer period (which may include the temporal zero-point), but the sentence does not tell 
us anything about this. It just makes a claim about (i.e. predicates something of) that 
part of the situation that coincides with the time indicated by five minutes ago. 
Predictability: the expression of the probability of the truth of a conclusion about a 
present situation (e.g. That will be the milkman, when interpreted as ‘It is predictable that 
that is the milkman’). Predictability is a more strongly epistemic notion than prediction in 
that it concerns the speaker’s assump-  tion of the strong plausibility of a conclusion. 
Prediction: assumption that a situation will actualize in the post-present (or, in the case 
of would, at a time posterior to the time of making the prediction). For example: John will 
be there, when interpreted as ‘I predict that John will be there’ (rather than as ‘it is 
predictable that John is there’—see predictability). Prediction is a more strongly 
epistemic (subjectified) notion than pure future in that it concerns an assumption made 
by the speaker, but is less epistemic (subjectified) than predictability. 
Premise-expressing P-clause: the P-clause of an inferential conditional 
Premodified reduced it-cleft: type of conditional in which the conditional as a whole is 
a specificational sentence, i.e. the variable and value constituents are distributed over 
the two clauses: the Q-clause specifies a value for a variable which is introduced by the 
P-clause (e.g. If anybody needs the publicity, it’s him, not us). It is typical of a premodified 
reduced it-cleft that the if-clause calls up the idea of a variable (which ranks high, or 

 
306
highest, on a particular scale) and that the Q-clause specifies what the speaker sees as 
the only true, or at least the most suitable, value for that variable. The Q-clause has the 
form of a reduced it-cleft, i.e. a cleft whose wh-clause is deleted because it would only 
repeat the contents of the if-clause. Thus, If anyone can do it, it’s you (which is 
interpreted as ‘If there is one x who can do it, that x is you’) is short for If anyone can do 
it, it’s you who can do it. 
Pre-present (sector): that part of (the speaker’s conceptualization of) the present time-
sphere that starts before the temporal zero-point and reaches up to it. Thus, both I have 
done it and I have been doing it locate my ‘doing it’ in the pre-present (sector). Because it 
is a period reaching up to (and including) the temporal zero-point, the pre-present is one 
of the sectors of the present time-sphere. 
Prerequisite P-clause: syntactically integrated P-clause which is introduced by only if, 
providing / provided (that), on condition that, or on the understanding that, all of which 
express that there is only one (unique) condition, which is therefore not only a sufficient 
but also a necessary condition (‘if and only if’). 
Prerequisite-P conditional: conditional with a prerequisite P-clause 
Present Perspective System: the system of tenses used to develop a post-present 
temporal domain. It involves the present tense for simultaneity (e.g. [Next time he will say 
that] it is his birthday), the past tense or present perfect for anteriority (e.g. [Next time he 
will say that] he {has done it / did it the day before}), and the future tense for posteriority 
(e.g. [He will say that] he will do it as soon as possible). 
Present sector: portion of the present time-sphere which coincides with the temporal 
zero-point. 
Present subjunctive: type of mood. In English, the present subjunctive form is the same 
as the infinitive (e.g. if needs be; if the truth be told). 
Present time-sphere: see time-sphere 
Presupposition: proposition which is assumed to be true by the speaker when she 
makes her utterance, in other words, a pragmatic condition which is assumed to be 
fulfilled. Thus, both I closed the door and I didn’t close the door presuppose that the door 
was not closed at the relevant time. (This illustrates a criterial property of 
presuppositions, viz. that they remain unaffected under nonmetalinguistic sentence 
negation.) 
Presupposition-cancelling-P 
conditional: 
subtype 
of 
presupposition-evaluating-P 
conditional in which the P-clause rejects a pragmatic presupposition made in the Q-
clause. For example: 
[“Well, as I was saying, what if the knife was stolen on the Wednesday afternoon to give 
everybody the impression that] the murder—if there is a murder—was committed later that 
Wednesday afternoon?”  (DOC) (The P-clause cancels the pragmatic presupposition of existence 
attached to the definite NP ‘the murder’.) 
Presupposition-evaluating-P conditional: subtype of evaluating-P rhetorical conditional 
in which the comment expressed in the P-clause does not concern the semantic content 
of Q as a whole, but only the justifiedness of a presupposition of the Q-proposition (e.g. 
In retrospect, the linkage, if there was one, appeared so very obvious). 
Presupposition-evaluating Q-less P-clause: Q-less P-clause (often with a heavy accent 
on if) used as a reply signalling doubt or reservation about the truth of a presupposition 

 
307
inherent in the statement to which the Q-less       P-clause is a reply: 
 
[“I will be happy when she comes.”] — “IF she comes.”  (‘when she comes’ presupposes that 
she will come) 
 
[“I’d like to know which of these books she read first.”] — “If either.” 
Presupposition-questioning-P conditional: subtype of presupposition-evaluating-P 
conditional in which the P-clause casts doubt on the truth of a pragmatic presupposition 
made in the Q-clause (e.g. In retrospect, the       linkage—if there were one—appeared 
obvious.) 
Preventative-P conditional: see preclusive-P conditional 
Process: type of situation: a process is a dynamic situation whose main characteristic is 
change, i.e. a development, a change of state or a transition into a state (e.g. The car 
slowed down; The man was dying). 
Proposition: the semantic contents of a clause when one disregards the aspects of 
meaning added by tense, aspect and modality. Thus, both John will come at five and 
John may have come at five express the proposition ‘John come at five’. 
Protasis: the P-clause of a conditional. Some people use the term in connection with 
inferential conditionals only, others in connection with case-specifying conditionals, and 
still others in connection with any conditional of the form ‘if P, (then) Q’. Because of this, 
the term is not used in this book. 
Pseudo-absolute tense form: a past, present perfect, present or future tense form that 
does not T-relate its STO to the real t0 (=temporal zero-point) but to a pseudo-zero-point. 
Pseudo-cleft (sentence): specificational copular sentence in which the wh-clause 
expressing the variable is processed as subject and the value con-stituent is subject 
complement, e.g. What I gave him was a BOOK. (This is interpreted as ‘the x which I gave 
him was: a book’.) 
Pseudo-hedge: expression that might seem to be a hedge but in fact does little in the 
way of genuine politeness or softening of a message (e.g. if you please in Pay me back by 
tomorrow evening if you please. [Otherwise I will have you beaten up.]) 
Pseudo-actualization conditional: conditional which purports to be an actualization-
triggering conditional, but is actually used for a quite different purpose. See pseudo-
implicative. 
Pseudo-implicative conditional: rhetorical conditional which looks like an implicative 
conditional, but is actually used for a quite different purpose. For example, in If you spit 
on the floor in your own house, you may do it here, what the speaker wants to convey is 
the message ‘Please don’t spit on the floor here’. This directive is expected to be observed 
irrespective of whether or not the addressee spits on the floor in his own house. This 
means (a) that Q does not express the message it purports to express—in fact, quite the 
contrary—and (b) that P is a premise neither for the overt Q nor for the opposite message 
which is to be read from the ironical use of the conditional. 
Pseudo-inferential: conditional which purports to be an inferential, but is actually used 
for a quite different purpose. See pseudo-implicative. 
Pseudo-Q conditional: conditional in which the overt Q-clause is only ostensibly the Q-
clause of the ‘if P, Q’ conditional. In fact, it is interpreted as a subclause of reason 
modifying a covert Q-clause. For example: If you are shot at, this bullet-proof jacket will 
protect you (=If you are shot at you won’t get hurt, because this bullet-proof jacket will 

 
308
protect you). 
Pseudo-Q inferential: pseudo-Q conditional of the inferential type (e.g. Oh WELL, if she 
phoned me YESterday, I was in LONdon. [=If she phoned me yesterday she {didn’t get / 
won’t have got} an answer because I was in London.]) 
Pseudo-zero-point (pseudo-t0): TO (=time of orientation) which is not the temporal zero-
point but is treated as if it were, viz. the central TO of a post-present domain and any TO 
represented as T-simultaneous or T-posterior to it. For example, in Next time he will say 
that he is ill, the central TO (=the time of saying) is treated as a pseudo-t0. This explains 
why the present tense (is) is used to represent the STO of the that-clause as T-
simultaneous with it. 
P-situation: the situation described in the P-clause (=conditional clause) of a conditional 
sentence 
#P-situation: the situation described in a #P-clause 
Pure future: the least subjectified use of the future tense: the speaker just locates an 
STO (=the time of a predicated situation) in the post-present without implying that it is 
her own expectation that the situation is going to actualize (e.g. [They tell me] the flower 
show will be held on 21 July). Pure future is less epistemic (subjectified) than prediction 
(which reveals an assumption on the part of the speaker), while prediction is itself less 
epistemic (subjectified) than predictability, which concerns the speaker’s assumption of 
the strong plausibility of a conclusion. 
Purely case-specifying-P conditional: subtype of case-specifying-P conditional which is 
not implicative and in which the P-clause just specifies a case or the case(s) in which (or 
the circumstances under which) Q is true or the Q-situation actualizes (e.g. ‘Raphael 
Hotel Altona’ is ideal if you like to be in the heart of things). 
Q: see Q-proposition 
#Q: the proposition expressed in a #Q-clause 
[+q]: positive (affirmative) Q 
[–q]: negative Q 
Q-clause: the head clause of a conditional sentence 
#Q-clause: the clause expressing ‘not-Q’ which is implied by a counterfactual-P 
conditional. For example, on its default (counterfactual-P) interpretation, the 
counterfactual Q-clause in Jane would have come if John had come implies the #Q-clause 
Jane did not come. 
Q-less conditional: conditional with covert Q-clause; P-clause used on its own (e.g. If 
you will come in now?) 
Q-proposition: the proposition expressed in the Q-clause (=head clause) of a conditional 
sentence 
#Q-proposition: the proposition expressed in a #Q-clause 
Q-situation: the situation described in the Q-clause of a conditional sentence 
#Q-situation: the situation described in a #Q-clause 
Reduced it-cleft: cleft sentence whose wh-clause is deleted because it would only repeat 
the contents of the preceding if-clause. Thus, it’s you in If anyone can do it, it’s you 
(which is interpreted as ‘If there is one x who can do it, that x is you’) is short for it’s you 
who can do it. 

 
309
Reduced P-clause: elliptic P-clause, as in Complaints, if any, will be dealt with by the 
manager himself. 
Reduced-P conditional: conditional with a reduced P-clause (e.g. If necessary, do it 
yourself!) 
Reduced Q-clause: elliptic Q-clause, as in [Thirty-four witnesses could testify to that.] 
Thirty-five, if you included the driver. 
Reduced-P conditional: conditional with a reduced Q-clause 
Relative tense: tense which does not relate an STO (=the time of a predicated situation) 
directly to the temporal zero-point but rather to some other TO (=time of orientation). A 
relative tense always indicates a temporal re-lation within a temporal domain (e.g. had 
left in [I knew] he had left early). 
Relevance conditional: conditional like If you’re hungry, there’s food in the fridge in 
which the purpose of the P-clause is to make it clear why the speaker deems it relevant 
to utter the Q-clause. The P-clause, which can be referred to as relevance-expressing, 
does not express the premise for an inferential reasoning process but the pragmatic 
factor(s) that make(s) it relevant for the speaker to utter the Q-clause. 
Relevance-expressing P-clause: the P-clause of a relevance conditional 
Reminding-P conditional: subtype of commenting-P rhetorical conditional in which the 
P-clause serves as a reminder (e.g. [Not today, Gordon.] I’m out for a meal, if you 
remember). 
Reporting clause: the head clause of a sentence representing indirect        reported 
speech (e.g. He said in He said he was ill). 
Restrictive postscript P-clause: postscript P-clause which has a restrictive meaning, 
i.e. which restricts the truth or applicability of the Q-clause a posteriori, as in I’ll drop in 
and see you at 10 tonight, if you will be alone. 
Restrictive postscript-P conditional: conditional with a restrictive postscript P-clause 
(e.g. You will never be able to afford such a house—unless someone bequeaths you a 
substantial sum of money). 
Rhetorical conditional: cover-term for all the conditionals whose P-clause is used for 
rhetorical purposes only (rather than being case-specifying). In chapter 10 we distinguish 
the following subtypes: six types of utterance conditionals (e.g. If you need any help this 
afternoon, I am free between 3 and 5.30), four types of comparing conditionals (e.g. If you 
think Pete’s children are badly behaved, you should see Diana’s twins), seven types of 
commenting-P conditionals (e.g. He’ll no doubt be late, if he turns up at all), pseudo-
implicatives (e.g. If you enjoy being insulted yourself, don’t hesitate to make racist remarks 
here), and pleonastic conditionals (e.g. If John won’t come, John won’t come. [So what?]). 
Rhetorical question: sentence that has the form of a question but is interpreted as a 
forceful statement (e.g. Who can blame him?)  
Scalarity: the phenomenon that a word (e.g. a focusing adjunct like even) is interpreted 
as a ‘scalar operator’, i.e. as representing the constituent which it focuses as extremely 
high or extremely low on a particular scale of values. For example, Even Mary managed 
to do it implies that (of those who did it) Mary was the least likely person (or one of the 
least likely ones) to be able to do it. (Here the scale is a scale of unlikelihood, on which 
the values are people that are increasingly unlikely to be able to ‘do it’.) 
Sector: see temporal sector 

 
310
Semelfactive situation: situation that actualizes only once, i.e. a non-    repetitive 
situation. 
Semi-nominal-P conditional: syntactically marked conditional in which the P-clause 
has a semi-nominal function, i.e. fulfils the syntactic function of conditional clause and 
(finite or nonfinite) noun clause at the same time. For example, in It doesn’t matter if you 
are poor the P-clause also functions as extraposed subject clause. 
Set-identifying P-clause: P-clause of a set-identifying-P conditional 
Set-identifying-P conditional: purely case-specifying-P conditional in which the P-
clause specifies the cases in which Q is claimed to be true by restricting the scope of the 
Q-predication to a subset of a plural set referred to or implied in the Q-clause. For 
example, in Children are orphans if their parents are dead, the if-clause restricts the 
scope of the Q-predication to a subset of the generic set of children. For this reason, the 
sentence is virtually synonymous with Children whose parents are dead are orphans. 
There are two kinds of set-identifying P-clauses, depending on whether the conjunction is 
if or unless. In the former case, the set is directly restricted by the if-clause, so that we 
speak of set-restricting P-clauses. When unless is used, the set is indirectly restricted by 
the exclusion of a subset (e.g. Lions are dangerous unless they aren’t hungry). In this case 
we speak of a subset-excluding P-clause. 
Set-restricting P-clause: the P-clause of a set-identifying-P conditional introduced by if. 
Such an if-clause restricts a set directly, as in Children are orphans if their parents are 
dead, where the if-clause restricts the scope of the Q-predication to a subset of the 
generic set of children. 
Shift of domain: the creation of a new temporal domain by the use of an absolute tense 
Shift of temporal perspective: the creation or expansion of a temporal domain by a 
tense that is typical of domains lying in a different temporal sector. For example, in They 
leave tomorrow, the present tense represents a post-present (=future) situation as if it 
were a present one. In I hear you have been promoted, the present tense represents a pre-
present situation as if it were a present one. In Next time his excuse will be that he is ill 
the time of the post-present excuse is treated as if it were the present. 
Similarity-expressing conditional: type of comparing conditional in which the speaker 
expresses the similarity between the P-situation and the Q-situation (or between 
participants in the situations) and affirms her belief that Q has the same degree of 
closedness as P. For example: If the case against him isn’t very strong, neither is that 
against his wife. 
Situation: cover term for the various possible types of contents of propositions, i.e. for 
anything that can be expressed in a clause: an action, event, process, or state. The verb 
actualize is used as a cover term for the predicates that are typically associated with one 
of these categories. 
Situation-TO: time of the predicated situation. 
Special-P modal auxiliary: auxiliary which in a certain meaning can only occur in a P-
clause, e.g. should in Should someone come, tell them to wait. 
Specificational anacoluthon: specificational conditional which is an anacoluthon, i.e. a 
sentence which is syntactically ‘incorrect’ because it is the result of blending two 
different syntactic constructions. For example: The only reason I’d do that would be if 
there were problems with the computer. (This sentence is a blending of The only reason I 

 
311
would do that would be that there were problems with the computer and I would only do 
that if there were problems with the computer.) 
Specificational clause / sentence: clause or sentence which specifies a value for a 
presupposed variable and in doing so focuses the value. For example, each of the 
following sentences specifies ‘a book’ as the value that satisfies the variable ‘the x that I 
gave him’ and implies ‘nothing else’: It was a BOOK that I gave him, What I gave him was a 
BOOK, A BOOK was what I gave him, I gave him a BOOK. 
Specificational conditional: conditional which is a specificational sentence, i.e. in 
which a postcopular P-clause specifies a value for a variable expressed in the Q-clause 
(e.g. The only case in which the police intervene is if the riots are going to spread from the 
slums to the rest of the city). 
Specificational P-clause: P-clause that is a specificational clause, i.e. that contains a 
focused constituent which is presented as the value of a specificational reading (e.g. If it 
wasn’t OSWALD who murdered Kennedy, who was it?) 
Specificational Q-clause: Q-clause that is a specificational clause, i.e. which contains a 
focused constituent that is presented as the value of a    specificational reading. For 
example: If it rains, it will be JOHN who drives us (=If it rains, the x who will drive us is: 
John). 
Speech act conditional: see utterance conditional 
Speech condition-defining-P conditional: subtype of commenting-P rhetorical 
conditionals in which the P-clause defines the conditions under which the speaker is 
speaking (e.g. If you want me to be honest, you look like a scarecrow in that dress; If I may 
speak for myself, I find it a splendid idea). 
Split conditional: conditional in which the P-clause and Q-clause are      syntactically 
independent of each other, but semantically still form a     single conditional (e.g. 
Suppose your wife cheated on you. How would you react?). 
Stacked-P conditional: conditional with stacked P-clauses, i.e. two or more P-clauses 
that belong to the same conditional sentence but have a different scope (e.g. If the 
dividend is fixed at let’s say £5 then if the interest rate goes up the market price goes 
down.) 
Standard direct inferential: direct inferential of the unmarked form ‘If P, Q’ (e.g. If we 
get financial aid, the project will be a success). 
State: type of situation: a state is a situation which is not dynamic, not agentive and 
does not involve change (e.g. John is my nephew). 
Statement: see declarative sentence 
Static situation: see state 
STO: abbreviation of situation-TO, time of the predicated situation. See predicated 
situation. 
Subclause: see subordinate clause 
Subordinate clause: clause which cannot function as an independent sentence but 
which can form a sentence when combined with a main clause (e.g. if you leave in I’ll be 
glad if you leave). 
Subjunctive conditional: term used by some linguists and philosophers to refer to 
tentative-P conditionals and/or counterfactual-P conditionals. Because it may or may not 

 
312
imply a distinction between these types, the term is potentially confusing and therefore 
not used in the present book. 
Subset-excluding P-clause: subclause introduced by unless or except if and functioning 
as the P-clause of a set-identifying-P conditional (e.g. Lions are dangerous unless they 
aren’t hungry). 
Supplementive clause: clause with the following characteristics: (a) It does not have a 
finite verb: it either has no verb at all or has a nonfinite verb (e.g. a participle); (b) It has 
no overt subject, but is interpreted as having the same subject as the main clause; (c) It 
is separated from the main clause by a break in intonation; (d) It is interpreted as having 
an adverbial meaning; unless introduced by a conjunction or preposition indicating 
otherwise, the unmarked interpretation is in terms of reason or cause. For example: Not 
knowing what to do, Bill came to me for advice. 
Suppressed condition: see covert condition 
Suppressed P-clause: see covert P-clause 
Suppressed-P conditional: see covert-P conditional 
T-anteriority: anteriority expressed by a tense. For example, in He said he had done it, 
the past perfect tense (had done) expresses T-anteriority. 
T-condition: condition on the truth of the proposition expressed in the Q-clause 
Temporal binding: the phenomenon that an STO (=the time of a predicated situation) is 
not related directly to the temporal zero-point (by the use of an absolute tense) but is 
related to another TO (=time of orientation). In other words, temporal binding is the 
expanding of a temporal domain by means of a relative tense. For example, in I knew he 
had lied, the STO of had lied is temporally bound by the STO of knew. We can speak of 
the ‘ound STO’ and the ‘binding STO’, respectively. 
Temporal focus: the phenomenon that the speaker’s tense choice is determined by her 
wish to focus on a particular portion of the time of the full situation. For example: [I 
spoke to the foreigner in French because] he didn’t understand English. (The foreigner 
presumably still does not understand English at the temporal zero-point, so the speaker 
could have used doesn’t understand. Using the past tense, however, she focuses on the 
time when she spoke to the foreigner rather than on the zero-time.) 
Temporal sector: Strictly speaking, a temporal sector is one of the three parts of the 
present time-sphere, viz. the pre-present sector, the present sector or the post-present 
sector. In a wider sense, we use the term absolute sectors as a cover-terms for these 
three sectors plus the past time-sphere. 
Temporal domain: A (temporal) domain is a set of times (TOs) which either consists of a 
single STO (=the time of a single predicated situation) or comprises several STOs that are 
temporally related to each other by     means of special tense forms. Thus, in the 
following example the four STOs are located within a single temporal domain: 
 
John said that he had worked hard all day, that he was tired and that he would go to bed 
early. 
A domain is established by an absolute tense form (in this case: said) and expanded by 
relative tense forms (had worked, was tired, would go). 
Temporal subordination: see temporal binding 
Temporal zero-point (t0): the most basic TO (=time of orientation) in the English tense 
system, i.e. the time to which STOs (=times of situations) can be related, but which is not 

 
313
itself temporally dependent on any other time. The temporal zero-point is usually the 
time of speech (=the time of coding the message), occasionally the time of decoding the 
message. 
Temporal zero-time: see temporal zero-point (t0) 
Tentative P-clause: P-clause referring to a tentative world. A tentative P-world is mostly 
assumed by the speaker to be unlikely to be (or become) the actual world. In other words, 
the speaker treats fulfilment of the supposition as a rather unlikely possibility (e.g. I 
would be happy if she came). A P-world can also be represented as tentative for reasons 
of tact, politeness, etc. (e.g. I would appreciate if you gave me a hand). 
Tentative-P conditional: theoretical conditional with a tentative P-clause (e.g. I would 
be happy if she came; If you moved your chair a bit, I could pass). 
Tentative world: possible world which is assumed by the speaker to be unlikely to be (or 
become) the actual world (e.g. the Q-world and the P-world in You would be punished if 
you did that). A world may also be treated as tentative for reasons of tact, politeness, etc. 
(e.g. Would you please help me?). 
Theoretical P-clause: P-clause referring to a theoretical world. A theoretical P-clause 
may be neutral, closed, open, tentative or counterfactual. 
Theoretical-P conditional: conditional with a theoretical P-clause 
Theoretical world: possible world other than the actual world 
Time of orientation (TO): any time that can serve as the origin of a temporal relation 
expressed by a tense form. 
Time of the predicated situation: situation-TO. See predicated situation. 
Time-sphere: The use of a tense form in English implies that the speaker views the time 
of the situation referred to as either past or nonpast with respect to the time functioning 
as temporal zero-point (which is usually the moment of speech). That is, any tense form 
locates its STO (=the time of its situation) either in the past time-sphere or in the present 
time-sphere. These time-spheres are not objective physical entities but represent the 
ways in which an English language user conceptualizes time. The past time-sphere is 
conceived of as a timespan of indefinite length which lies wholly before (and hence does 
not include) the temporal zero-point. To locate an STO in this time-sphere the speaker 
uses the preterite (past tense). The present time-sphere is conceived of as a timespan of 
indefinite length which in-cludes the zero-point and is divided by it into three sectors: the 
portion of the present time-sphere that starts before the zero-point and reaches up to it 
is the pre-present sector; the portion that coincides with the zero-point is the present 
sector; and the portion that follows the zero-point is the post-present sector. 
TO: see time of orientation 
Topic-introducing P-clause: conditional clause which introduces a ‘discourse topic’ 
(=what is talked about in a continuous stretch of discourse). For example, in If your sister 
is clever, mine is positively a genius, the P-clause introduces the discourse topic (=the 
intelligence of certain people). A topic-introducing P-clause contains some ‘old’ or ‘given’ 
information which functions as a starting-point to which the information in the Q-clause 
can be related. 
T-posteriority: posteriority (futurity) expressed by a tense. For example, in He said he 
would do it, the conditional tense (would do) expresses posteriority. 
Transparent interpretation: interpretation in terms of the speaker’s actual world. For 

 
314
example, in John believes that Paris is the capital of Italy, the that-clause is true in the 
intensional world of John’s belief, but not in (what the speaker knows to be) the actual 
world. That is, Paris is the capital of Italy is true on an opaque interpretation, but not on 
a transparent one. 
T-relation: temporal relation expressed by a tense 
Truth-confirming P-clause: P-clause of a truth-evaluating-P rhetorical conditional 
which conveys the message that what is said in the Q-clause is true (e.g. If the truth be 
told, I married her only for her money). 
Truth-evaluating-P conditional: Subtype of evaluating-P rhetorical conditional in which 
the speaker’s comment concerns the degree to which the content of the Q-clause is true 
(e.g. If we’re to believe Ted, Caroline’s  pregnant). 
T-simultaneity: simultaneity as expressed by a tense. For example, the present tense 
(do) expresses T-simultaneity in I’ll be very angry if you do that. 
Turn-holding P-clause: P-clause that serves as a device for the speaker to prolong her 
turn in the conversation (e.g. If you will listen to me for one more minute, [I will tell you 
what her secret is]). 
Turn-taking P-clause: P-clause which serves as a device for the speaker to take her turn 
in the conversation (e.g. If I may be so bold as to interrupt you, ...). 
Unbounded noun phrase: noun phrase with unbounded reference, i.e. noun phrase 
referring to a set whose boundaries are unspecified (e.g. bees). An unbounded noun 
phrase has homogeneous reference: bees can indicate any set or subset of bees. 
Utterance conditional: conditional expressing a relation between the content of P and 
the speech act of uttering the Q-clause: the P-clause expresses what renders it possible, 
relevant or necessary for the speaker to utter the Q-clause. The P-clause can therefore be 
referred to as utterance-licensing. In section 10.1 we distinguish between the following 
subtypes: relevance conditionals (e.g. If you need any help this afternoon, I am free 
between 3 and 5.30.), anchoring-P conditionals (e.g. If he noticed Brand, he didn’t 
comment), performative-Q conditionals (e.g. If those are the terms you’re offering me, I 
accept the job), metalinguistic-Q conditionals (e.g. If the victim was strangled, they would 
probably conclude that the murderer was a man), nonassertoric utterance conditionals 
(e.g. If someone should come while I’m away, tell them I’ll be back around 11.) and 
commenting-Q    utterance conditionals (e.g. If this is the famous Mona Lisa, it’s not half 
as good as everybody says). 
Utterance-licensing P-clause: the P-clause of an utterance conditional 
Value (of specificational clause / sentence): that constituent of a specificational 
structure that is specified as value for a presupposed variable, e.g. a book in It was a 
BOOK that I gave him, What I gave him was a BOOK, I gave him a BOOK, A BOOK was what I 
gave him. 
Variable (of specificational clause / sentence): that constituent of a specificational 
structure for which a value is specified. For example, in each of the following sentences 
the variable is ‘the x that I gave him’: It was a BOOK that I gave him, What I gave him was 
a BOOK, I gave him a BOOK, A BOOK was what I gave him. 
Verb phrase: In this book the label ‘verb phrase’ is used to indicate that portion of a 
clause which is not the subject and which does not include ‘disjunct’ or ‘conjunct’ 
adverbials (like frankly, however...). 

 
315
VP: see verb phrase 
W-anteriority: anteriority that exists in the actual world (or in whatever world is being 
referred to) but which is not necessarily expressed by the tense used. For example, in I 
left before John arrived, my leaving is W-anterior to John’s arrival but is not represented 
as T-anterior to it by the tense form left. 
wh-question: question beginning with a question word (who, what, which, whose, when, 
why, where, how). 
W-relation: temporal relation that exists in the actual world (or in whatever world is 
being referred to) but which is not necessarily expressed by the tense used. 
W-posteriority: posteriority that exists in the actual world (or in whatever world is being 
referred to) but which is not necessarily expressed by the tense used. For example, in I 
left before John arrived, John’s arrival is W-posterior to my leaving but is not represented 
as T-posterior to it by the tense form left. 
W-simultaneity: simultaneity that exists in the actual world (or in what-ever world is 
being referred to) but which is not necessarily expressed by the tense used. For example, 
in There had been no one in the house when he had first visited it, the two situations are 
W-simultaneous with each other, but the past perfect tense forms represent both as T-
anterior to a common past time of orientation. 
Yes/no-question: see polar question 
Zero-conjunction: see zero-connection 
Zero-connection: the phenomenon that the P-clause of a conditional is not introduced 
by a conditional conjunction but shows subject-auxiliary in-   version (e.g. Should 
someone come, tell them I’m not at home).
