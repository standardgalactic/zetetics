Abstract
Based on energy conservation in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
Universe, on the Legendre transformation between energy density and pressure, and
on nonperturbative asymptotic freedom at high temperatures we derive the coeﬃcient
νCMB in the high-temperature (T) – redshift (z) relation, T/T0 = νCMB(z + 1), of
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Theoretically, our calculation relies on a
deconﬁning SU(2) rather than a U(1) photon gas. We prove that νCMB = (1/4)1/3 =
0.629960(5), representing a topological invariant. Interestingly, the relative deviation
of νCMB from the critical exponent associated with the correlation length l of the
3D Ising model, νIsing = 0.629971(4), is less than 2 × 10−5.
We are not yet in a
position to establish a rigorous theoretical link between νCMB and νIsing as suggested
by the topological nature of νCMB and the fact that both theories share a universality
class. We do, however, line out a somewhat speculative map from the physical Ising
temperature θ to a ﬁctitious SU(2) Yang-Mills temperature T, the latter continuing
the asymptotic behavior of the scale factor a on T/T0 for T/T0 ≫1 down to T = 0,
and an exponential map from a to l to reproduce critical Ising behavior.

That an SU(2) gauge principle underlies the description of thermal photon gases is a
theoretically supported [1] and phenomenologically plausible possibility [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In
particular implications of the high-redshift relation, T/T0 = νCMB(z+1), with νCMB = 0.63
(a result obtained by numerical analysis, see below) were investigated in view of the
redshift zre of (instantaneous) reionization of the Universe and the present value of the
cosmological expansion rate H0 [4, 5]. In both cases discrepancies are resolved between
local, that is, low-z cosmological observation on one hand and ﬁts to CMB angular power
spectra, including high-z information, on the other hand. Aside from this cosmological
motivation, a theoretical understanding of the coeﬃcient νCMB is interesting in its own
right. Moreover, a venue to analyse critical behaviour may emerge for models that share
the universality class of SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics concerning its deconﬁning-
preconﬁning phase transition. The purpose of this short note is to actually derive the
value of νCMB.
The underlying equation to determine the T-z relation of deconﬁning SU(2)CMB ther-
modynamics is [4]
dρ
da = −3
a (ρ + P) ,
(1)
where ρ, P, and a denote SU(2)CMB energy density and pressure, respectively, and a refers
to the cosmological scale factor, normalized such that today a(T0) = 1, T0 = 2.725 K
indicating the present baseline temperature of the CMB [7]. As usual, z and a are related
as a−1 = z + 1. Formally, Eq. (1) is solved by
a = exp

To further process the integrand in Eq. (2) it is useful to appeal to the Legendre transfor-
mation and its T-diﬀerentiated version

where M denotes an arbitrary mass scale, and the entropy density s is given as
s = ρ + P

(5)
Note that a potential, direct contribution to s from the thermal ground state [1] actually
is absent due to its cancellation in the sum ρ+P. The important feature of Eq. (4) is that
its right-hand side solely refers to the boundary values of the state variable s at T0 and
T. Therefore, this right-hand side is independent of any intermediate thermodynamics
dynamics. In this sense, the solution to Eq. (1) of a topological nature.
Let us now discuss the situation at high temperatures. For T ≫T0, where the Stefan-
Boltzmann limit is well saturated [1], s(T) is proportional to T 3. On the other hand, we
1

know that at T0 the excitations of the theory represent a free photon gas because the mass
of vector modes diverges. Therefore, s(T0) is proportional to T 3
0 . As a consequence, the
ratio s(T)/s(T0) in Eq. (4) reads

where g refers to the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the respective tempera-
tures. We have g(T) = 2×1+3×2 = 8 (two photon polarizations plus three polarizations
for each of the two vector modes) and g(T0) = 2 × 1 (two photon polarizations). Substi-
tuting this into Eq. (6) and inserting the result into Eq. (4), we arrive at

In [8] it was argued that the order parameter for deconﬁnement in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills
thermodynamics, the 3D Polyakov-loop variable P, should obey long-range dynamics gov-
erned by (electric) Z2 center symmetry which is the global symmetry of the Ising model
void of an external magnetic ﬁeld. Sharing a universality class, the critical exponents
of the correlation lengths thus should coincide for both theories. The superb agreement
between νIsing = 0.629971(4) [9] and νCMB,

(9)
is indicative of such a link between the two theories even though νCMB appears as a
coeﬃcient in a cosmological T-z relation and not as a critical exponent governing the
divergence of the correlation length l. Still, νCMB is a topologically determined number, a
feat being characteristic of a critical exponent. We emphasize that an analytic derivation
of a 3D Ising exponent via 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics is an extremely useful
benchmark.
However, in spite of the above arguments a rigorous link is not in sight
presently.
What one can try to do though, is to continue the asymptotic behavior of Eq. (7) down
to T = 0, where a diverges, positing that a monotonic increasing function of a describes
the ratio l/l0 of the Ising correlation length l to some reference length l0 and that therefore
already the Yang-Mills asymptotics catches the downward approach of scale invariance at
the second order transition of the Ising model. This renders T a ﬁctitious temperature in
deconﬁning SU(2) Yang-Mills theory (for T ≤T0 this theory does not obey the asymptotics
of Eq. (7) [1]). One may now construct a map from the physical Ising temperature θ to
T/T0 as

Obviously, T ↘0 implies that τ ↘1, and T/T0 ↘1 associates with τ ↘1 + e−1 ∼
1.367879, see also Fig. 1. Substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (7) and exponentiating, we arrive
at
exp(a) = (τ −1)−νCMB .
(11)
As τ ↘1 this yields the same l/l0 critical behavior for exp(a), and the above-mentioned
monotonic function thus turns out to be the exponential map.
