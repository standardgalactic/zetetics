BASIC ELECTRICITY 101
Kevin Booker, Executive Director
State Electrical Division of Nebraska

OBJECTIVES
Review some typical hazards 
associated with electricity and 
learn how to mitigate the 
hazards.

In the United States, 
electrical hazards are 
ranked number 6 
among all causes of 
work-related deaths.

SINGLE PHASE ELECTRIC PANEL

circuit breakers access the 
incoming power:

I = V/R
So a 2000 watt UPS will draw how 
many amps?
2000/120 =16.66 amps
A standard 20 amps outlet is 
designed to carry 80%, that 
would be 16 amps.
How much additional load will this 
circuit handle?

NEC 110.13. Mounting and Cooling of 
Equipment.
This requirement is always in dispute, it 
seems. Cramming equipment into an 
overcrowded arrangement to maximize 
revenue per square foot sounds like a 
really good idea until that equipment 
starts failing left and right, or the whole 
place just burns down.
NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE


Do YOU push the test button 
on GFCIs and AFCIs monthly? 
It’s HARD to remember 
without calendaring the task!

NEC 110.3. Examination, Identification, 
and Use of Equipment. This section gives 
8 requirements for examination in part 
(A). In (B), it says "Listed or Labeled 
equipment shall be installed and used in 
accordance with any instructions 
included in the Listing or Labeling." 
In other words, use the product as 
intended. Unauthorized modifications 
void the Listing and expose the modifier 
to civil, and potentially criminal, litigation 
and liability.

Back in 2005 the CPSC (Consumer 
Product Safety Commission) went to the 
electrical manufacturers of GFCI’s and 
asked them to develop self testing 
devices. 
The original scope was that the device 
would shut down if it did not pass the 
self test and hence create the safety 
that these devices are there to provide. 








OSHA STANDARDS
Section 1926.416(e)(1) provides that "worn 
or frayed electrical cords or cables shall not 
be used." Superficial nicks or abrasions —
those that only slightly penetrate the outer 
jacket of a flexible cord, and do not permit 
the cord to bend more in that area than in 
the rest of the cord — do not normally 
render a cord "worn or frayed." Therefore, 
there is no need to repair or replace such a 
cord.


Stapled through cord!




AMPACITY AND WIRE INSULATION 
*According to the electrical code, the overcurrent 
protection shall not exceed 15A for #14, 20A for 
#12, or 30A for #10
(However, insulation is a factor in 
locations above 86F)

TWO TYPES OF 
BURNS FROM SHOCK
Surface Burns:

Caused
by
entrance
and
exit
of
electrical currents through the body

Can
be
caused
by
a
very
small
amount of current

1st degree to 3rd degree

ARC FLASH & BLAST
RELATIVE TO THE HUMAN BODY:

A
2nd
degree
burn
threshold,
or
a
‘just
curable burn threshold,’ is skin temperature
raised to 175oF for 0.1 second.

A 3rd degree burn threshold, or ‘incurable
burn threshold,’ is skin temperature raised
to 200oF for 0.1 second.

Eardrum damage > 720 psf

Lung damage > 1728 psf

TWO TYPES OF BURNS 
FROM SHOCK
Internal Tissue Burns:

Caused
by
current
flowing
through organs of the body

Caused by currents in excess
of 1.5 amps

4th degree (internal)

Internal organs

Typically Fatal
