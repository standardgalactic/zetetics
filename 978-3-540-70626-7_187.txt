Rigged Hilbert Spaces for the Dirac Formalism
of Quantum Mechanics

Introduction
As explained in the preceding entry [1], the original motivation for introducing
Rigged Hilbert Spaces (RHS) in quantum mechanics was to provide a rigorous for-
mulation of the  Dirac notation. This was done in the 1960s, independently by

652
Rigged Hilbert Spaces for the Dirac Formalism of Quantum Mechanics
Antoine [2–4] Bohm [5, 6], Roberts [7, 8], and jointly by Kristensen, Meljbo and
Poulsen [9], with many later contributions, e.g. [10–14] (Actually, the idea to use
an RHS in the formulation of quantum mechanics was suggested to JPA in 1962 by
Bargmann, then on sabbatical in Z¨urich).
We recall that a rigged Hilbert space is a triplet of spaces
 ⊂H ⊂×,
(1)
where H is a Hilbert space,  is a dense subspace of H, endowed with a locally
convex topology τ that is ﬁner than the norm topology inherited from H (i.e.,
a stronger notion of convergence), and × is the space of continuous antilinear
functionals F(φ) on . By duality, each space in (1) is dense in the next one and all
embeddings are linear and continuous. Standard examples of rigged Hilbert spaces
are the Schwartz distribution spaces over R or RN, namely S ⊂L2 ⊂S× or
D ⊂L2 ⊂D× [15–17].
As discussed in [1], Dirac’s formalism undergoes some rather subtle modiﬁca-
tions to achieve rigor; nevertheless, its formal features that are used in quantum
theory are largely reproduced by a RHS  ⊂H ⊂× with  given, in the sim-
plest case, by the abstract Schwartz space. To show how and why this RHS structure
provides a rigorous meaning to Dirac’s formalism, we have to describe the mathe-
matics involved in more detail. In particular, we must describe how to choose the
space  for a given physical system, then make the link with the measurement pro-
cess and ﬁnally discuss the realization of symmetries in this new framework.
Mathematical Properties of the RHS
Given the Hilbert space H of (1), the choice of the space  is not yet ﬁxed, but
it depends on the system at hand. In general,  is required to fulﬁll the following
conditions:
(1)  should be complete with respect to τ; that is, every Cauchy sequence con-
verges to an element of .
(2)  should be reﬂexive; that is, the dual of the dual of  can be identiﬁed with ,
(×)× ≃. In most cases,  can be obtained as the intersection of a countable
family of Hilbert spaces,  = ∩n∈NHn. It is then a Fr´echet space.
(3)  should be nuclear. In the case where  = ∩n∈NHn, this means that, for each
n, there is an m > n such that the embedding Hm →Hn is a Hilbert–Schmidt
operator.
Next, we must ﬁx our notation. For F ∈×, F(φ) will denote the value of F at
the vector φ ∈. If F ∈H, we normalize the duality form by requiring F(φ) =
(φ|F), where (·|·) denotes the scalar product of H (recall that F is antilinear). This
motivates the notation F(φ) ≡⟨φ|F⟩for any φ ∈ and F ∈×, with the obvious
convention ⟨F|φ⟩= ⟨φ|F⟩∗, such that ⟨φ|F⟩= (φ|F) for F ∈H ⊂×. That is,
the functional ⟨φ|F⟩is an extension of the Hilbert space scalar product.

The motivation for the nuclearity property (3) above is that it allows one to ex-
ploit the nuclear spectral theorem of Gel’fand and Maurin [16,17], which says the
following: Let A be a closed linear operator in H, which maps  into itself continu-
ously with respect to τ. Then A may be transported by duality to a linear operator
A× : × →×, which is an extension of the usual adjoint operator A† in the
Hilbert space, namely:
A×F(φ) = F(Aφ), for all φ ∈ and for all F ∈×,
(2)
which we also write
⟨φ|A×F⟩= ⟨Aφ|F⟩, ∀φ ∈, F ∈×.
(3)
For such an operator, the vector ξλ ∈× is called a generalized eigenvector of A,
with eigenvalue λ ∈C, if it satisﬁes
⟨φ|A×ξλ⟩≡A×ξλ(φ) = λ∗ξλ(φ) ≡λ∗⟨φ|ξλ⟩, for all φ ∈.
(4)
This equality can also be written in the Dirac notation as
A×|ξλ⟩= λ∗|ξλ⟩,
|ξλ⟩∈×.
(5)
Now assume that A has a self-adjoint extension A0 in H with a non-degenerate
spectrum, and that  is nuclear and complete. In this case, A× is an extension
of both A and A0 (collectively, ?
A). Then the nuclear spectral theorem asserts
that A (or ?
A) possesses a complete orthonormal set of generalized eigenvectors
ξλ ∈×, λ ∈R. This means that, for any two φ, ψ ∈, one has
⟨φ|ψ⟩=

R
ξλ(φ) ξλ(ψ)∗dμ(λ)
≡

R
⟨φ|ξλ⟩⟨ξλ|ψ⟩dμ(λ)
(6)
for some measure μ on R. For quantum mechanical operators A, the measure μ
may be split into a discrete and an absolutely continuous part such that (6) can be
written as
⟨φ|ψ⟩=

i
⟨φ|λi⟩⟨λi|ψ⟩+

⟨φ|λρ⟩⟨λρ|ψ⟩ρ(λ)dλ,
(7)
where the {λi} are the discrete eigenvalues of A in H, |ξλ⟩⟨ξλ|dμ(λ) = |λρ⟩⟨λρ|ρ(λ)
dλ, where ρ(λ) is a non-negative integrable function and the integral extends over
the absolutely continuous Hilbert space spectrum of A. Then, the Dirac kets are
|λ⟩= |λρ⟩√ρ(λ).

Rigged Hilbert Spaces for the Dirac Formalism of Quantum Mechanics
The net result of this theorem is to put the eigenvalues and the points of the
continuous spectrum of A on the same footing — exactly what is usually assumed
in the Dirac formulation of quantum mechanics. Indeed, using Dirac’s notation, (6)
and (7) are written as a decomposition of the identity:
I =

R
|ξλ⟩⟨ξλ| dμ(λ) =

i
|λi⟩⟨λi| +

R
dλ |λ⟩⟨λ|,
⟨λ|λ′⟩= δ(λ −λ′), (8)
with the proviso that this quantity makes sense only between two vectors of .
In other words, I must be understood as the (linear) embedding of  into ×, or
equivalently as a sesquilinear form on  × .
Actually the symbol |ξλ⟩⟨ξλ| in (8) may be interpreted as a genuine projection
operator from  onto the λ-component in the decomposition, combining von Neu-
mann’s direct integral approach with the nuclear spectral theorem. According to von
Neumann, the self-adjoint operator A determines a decomposition of H into a direct
integral of one-dimensional spaces H(λ):
H ≃
 ⊕
R
H(λ) dμ(λ),
(9)
which “diagonalizes” A:
f ∼{f (λ)}, f (λ) ∈H(λ), with ∥f ∥2 =

R
|f (λ)|2 dμ(λ),
(10)
Af ∼{λf (λ)}.
(11)
As already mentioned, the difﬁculty with this formulation is that H(λ) is not a
subspace of H if λ is a point of μ-measure zero. This is why there are no true
eigenvectors associated to the points of the continuous spectrum.
However, if the space  in (1) is nuclear, then the map τλ : φ →φ(λ), φ ∈,
φ(λ) ∈H(λ), is continuous and nuclear for μ-almost all λ. Therefore, one may
write
τλφ = φ(λ) = ⟨φ|ξλ⟩h(λ), where ξλ ∈×, h(λ) ∈H(λ).
(12)
Then the dual mapping τ ′
λ : H(λ) →× is continuous as well and it allows us
to identify each vector ξ ∈H(λ) with a functional 8ξ = τ ′
λξ ∈×. Finally, the
combined map χλ = τ ′
λτλ, which is a nuclear operator mapping  into ×, acts as
a projection operator onto the eigensubspace ×
λ corresponding to the eigenvalue λ.
If the spectrum of the self-adjoint operator A0 has non-trivial multiplicity, i.e.,
dim H(λ) > 1, as in the case of a spherically symmetric Hamiltonian described in
(4.c) of [1], then the whole machinery still goes through. The map τλ of (12) reads as
τλφ = φ(λ) =

n
⟨φ|ξλ,n⟩hn(λ),
(13)

where ξλ,n ∈× and {hn(λ), n = 1, 2, . . .dim H(λ)} is a basis of H(λ). Thus the
expansion (8) becomes
I =


n
|λ, n⟩⟨λ, n|,
⟨λ, n|λ′, n′⟩= δ(λ −λ′)δn,n′.
(14)
Yet a word of caution is necessary here. If one is interested only in the spectral
properties of A, one may require that the spectrum of A in × consists exactly of
the points of its spectrum in H. If this is the case, one says that (1) is a tight rigging
for A. Tight riggings are by no means guaranteed for a given operator A, as can be
seen from the sufﬁcient conditions given in [18–21]. On the other hand, there are
important cases where one actually needs generalized eigenvalues that do not belong
to the Hilbert space spectrum of A. As we can see in [1] and [22], scattering theory
is a major example, where resonances are associated with complex eigenvalues of
the Hamiltonian, with Gamow vectors as generalized eigenvectors. As operators in
the  Hilbert space, these Hamiltonians are self-adjoint and as such their Hilbert
space spectra are real. Therefore, a tight rigging would not permit a description of
resonance states by complex eigenvectors. However, in the more general case, it is
possible to construct rigged Hilbert spaces such that self-adjoint Hamiltonians have
complex generalized eigenvalues [23–25].
As mentioned in [1], the von Neumann approach to quantum mechanics has
conceptual and mathematical difﬁculties. For instance, many of the  operators
representing physical observables, such as position and momentum fulﬁlling the
commutation relations
#
Qi, Pj
$
= iδijI, are necessarily non-continuous operators.
(In general, the generators of unitary representations of non-compact subgroups of
a Lie group are non-continuous, i.e., unbounded.) Unbounded operators cannot be
deﬁned on the whole Hilbert space and as such there are subtle issues associated
with choosing an appropriate dense domain in which they can be well-deﬁned. This
is the reason why Dirac’s notion of an algebra of observables is difﬁcult to realize
in the Hilbert space theory. Furthermore, not all  self-adjoint operators can be in-
terpreted as physical  observables and not all elements of the Hilbert space can be
interpreted as states. In the Hilbert space, there are physical vectors that represent
preparable states and many other vectors that do not. Furthermore, there are gener-
alized vectors associated with quantum measurements, which are not elements of
the Hilbert space.
As the point of departure for the rigged Hilbert space theory, one can consider the
construction of the space  in (1) in such a way that physical observables are deﬁned
as continuous, bounded operators in . One starts with the Hilbert space theory and
identiﬁes a common, dense, invariant domain D on which the “relevant” observables
of the theory are deﬁned. In particular, one chooses a distinguished (“labeled” [7])
family O of observables, which have both a meaningful physical interpretation (in

656
Rigged Hilbert Spaces for the Dirac Formalism of Quantum Mechanics
terms of measurements, say) and a mathematical deﬁnition (as self-adjoint operators
with a dense invariant domain D in H). Hence, O is an algebra of operators on D.
Then, one equips this domain with a suitable (“projective”) topology that makes all
the elements of O continuous operators and calls the resulting topological vector
space . Taking duals, one obtains a RHS  ⊂H ⊂×, deﬁned by the system.
A simple example is the algebra generated by P, Q and I for the harmonic oscillator
[26]. For unitary representations of all ﬁnite dimensional non-compact Lie groups,
an RHS can be constructed in a similar way [27]. The space  constructed this way
is nuclear for a large class of representations [27]. Therefore, the nuclear spectral
theorem applies and yields a rigorous formulation of Dirac’s bra-and-ket formalism
for which the Dirac kets appear as generalized eigenvectors of operators (generators)
for non-compactsubalgebras. These results are routinely used by physicists, but they
cannot be justiﬁed solely in Hilbert space.
The simplest class of examples in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is that of
a particle, either free or in a nice potential V . The labeled observables are position
Q, momentum P and energy H = P2/2m + V (Q). The corresponding RHS is
S(R3) ⊂L2(R3) ⊂S×(R3). The most well-recognized representative of this class
of examples is the harmonic oscillator potential mentioned above [26].
As a byproduct of the RHS formulation, a new interpretation of quantum mea-
surements suggests itself. Given the RHS just constructed, it seems natural to
interpret  as the space of physical states, i.e., states that can be prepared in actual
experiments (notice that, since the Hamiltonian H is certainly an element of O, all
the states in  automatically have a ﬁnite energy, since they belong to the domain
of H). Now an element of × is an antilinear functional on , i.e., a procedure
that associates a number to each state, while preserving the linear structure. This is
clearly related to a measurement apparatus or a reference frame.
Group Representations
Ever since the work of Wigner and others [28–34], unitary representations of groups
have been used to describe  symmetry transformations in quantum physics. In par-
ticular, the famous symmetry representation theorem of Wigner [33] and Bargmann
[34] asserts that the symmetry transformations of a physical system are represented
in the state vector space, taken to be a Hilbert space H, by unitary (or antiunitary)
operators. Therefore, if G is the (Lie) group of symmetry transformations of a phys-
ical system, then what is of interest in quantum theory is a unitary representation U
of G in the Hilbert space H of the system. For instance, symmetry transformations
of non-relativistic and relativistic spacetime are described in quantum physics by
unitary representations of the Galilei group and Poincar´e group, respectively.
If U is a unitary representation of a symmetry group G, then U(g), g ∈G,
should transform physical states into physical states, continuously, and similarly for

observables |FE⟩⟨FE| or |ψ⟩⟨ψ| representing measurement apparatuses. Thus one
should have two other realizations of U, in addition to U itself, namely:
• One in , denoted U. This representation is the restriction of U in H to :
U(g)φ = U(g)φ for g ∈G, φ ∈.
• And one in ×, denoted U×
 . This is the extension of U† from H to ×:
U×
 (g)F = U†(g)F for g ∈G, F ∈H.
The two representations U and U×
 are contragredient of each other. That is,
⟨U×
 (g−1)F|U(g)φ⟩= ⟨F|
%
U×
 (g−1)
&×
U(g)φ⟩
= ⟨F|U(g−1)U(g)φ⟩= ⟨F|U(g−1)U(g)φ⟩
= ⟨F|φ⟩, ∀g ∈G, φ ∈, F ∈×,
(15)
which corresponds to the unitarity of U acting in H:
%
U†(g−1)f |U(g)h
&
= (U(g)f |U(g)h) = (f |h) , ∀g ∈G and f, h ∈H.
(16)
As is easily veriﬁed, this deﬁnition implies that U×
 is an extension of both U†
 and
U†, as it should in view of (1).
As we have said, in general the space  is supposed to be a reﬂexive Fr´echet
space. For consistency, we must assume that the representation U is continuous in
, that is, the map g →Uφ is continuous from G to , for every φ ∈. Then the
contragredient representation U×
 is automatically continuous in × [35]. Notice
that rigged Hilbert spaces of this type have also been used in pure group theory,
namely in the decomposition of unitary representations of non-compact groups like
SU(1,1) or SOo(2,1) [36,37].
From Group to Semigroup Representations
According to the results of Wigner and Bargmann for Hilbert space and the sub-
sequent extensions of these results to rigged Hilbert spaces as outlined above,
spacetime transformations of a quantum system are given by representations of the
Galilei or Poincar´e group. As a special case, we now consider the one-parameter
time evolution group U†(t). Applied to an in-state vector φ+ (see [1, Sec.III]),
we get
φ+(t) = e−iHtφ+ = U†(t)φ+,
with −∞< t < ∞.
(17)
This follows as the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation (21) when it is solved under
the Hilbert space boundary condition. Similarly, the time evolution of an operator
&−representing an observable is given by
&−(t) = eiHt&−e−iHt = U(t)&−U†(t)
%
or, ψ−(t) = eiHtψ−
for &−= |ψ−⟩⟨ψ−|
&
,
with −∞< t < ∞,
(18)

658
Rigged Hilbert Spaces for the Dirac Formalism of Quantum Mechanics
as follows from the solution of the Heisenberg equation (22) under the Hilbert space
boundary condition. The U(t) as well as U†(t) = U−1(t) with −∞< t < ∞
form a group of unitary operators in Hilbert space. With this unitary time evolution,
the Born probabilities for an observable &−in the state φ+(t) (or, equivalently, of
&−(t) in φ+) can be calculated as
Pφ+(t)(&−) = Tr
%
U†(t)|φ+⟩⟨φ+|U(t)&−&
= Tr
%
|φ+⟩⟨φ+|U(t)&−U†(t)
&
( Schr¨odinger picture)
( Heisenberg picture)
for all −∞< t < +∞.
(19)
The Bargmann–Wigner theorem is based on the assumption that for every trans-
formation of the observable relative to the state, there exists an inverse transforma-
tion also of the observable relative to the state. This assumed symmetry of time
translations is encoded in the unitary group U(t) of (18). However, such inverse
time translations are physically impossible since an observable can be measured on
a state φ+ only after the state has been prepared, say at a ﬁnite time t0 (which can
be set to t0 = 0). That means that the probability for an observable &−(t) in the
state φ+,
Pφ+(&−(t)) = Tr
%
|φ+⟩⟨φ+|U(t)&−U†(t)
&
(20)
makes sense only for t ⩾t0 = 0 at which time the state φ+ has been prepared.
This is a manifestation of causality and it implies that the time evolution of an
observable relative to the state is physically deﬁned only for t ⩾0. Therefore, the
time translations of the state relative to the observable, or equivalently, also of the
observable relative to the state, should be represented in the mathematical theory
by a semigroup, rather than a unitary group. From this observation we infer that the
time evolution must be given by semigroups U(t), t ⩾0 in (17) and U†(t), t ⩾0
in (18) [38].
Although there is no direct experimental reason in favor of unitary group rep-
resentations for time evolution, unitary evolutions are intrinsic to the mathematical
structure of Hilbert space. In particular, a theorem due to Stone and von Neumann
states that every self-adjoint operator A generates a unitary group U(α), −∞<
α < +∞, such that i dU(α)
dα

α=0 = A. For the time evolution of the state φ+(t), this
means (17) is the solution to the Schr¨odinger dynamical equation
iℏdφ+(t)
dt
= Hφ+(t)
under the boundary condition φ+(t) ∈H,
(21)
while for the time evolution of the observable &−(t) = |ψ−(t)⟩⟨ψ−(t)|, (18) is the
solution to the Heisenberg dynamical equation
iℏdψ−(t)
dt
= −Hψ−(t)
under the boundary condition ψ−(t) ∈H.
(22)

Put differently, if one solves these dynamical differential equations under the bound-
ary conditions of the Hilbert space, then one always gets unitary group solutions.
Similarly, if we solve these equations under the boundary conditions of the Schwartz
RHS. That is, the solutions to the differential equations (21) and (22) under the con-
ditions φ+ ∈ and ψ−∈ are still of the form (17) and (18) with −∞< t < +∞
(though, due to the topological structure of  and ×, the continuity and differen-
tiability of these representations are different from those of unitary representations
in the Hilbert space). Thus, although it has the many advantages outlined above,
the RHS (1) of Dirac’s formalism given by Schwartz RHS does not overcome the
causality problem of Hilbert space quantum mechanics. The solution to this prob-
lem, along with a consistent theory of quantum scattering and decay phenomena
is given by an extension of the RHS framework using smooth, rapidly decaying
Hardy functions in place of the Schwartz functions of (1). This Hardy space theory
is described in the accompanying article [22].

38. In the relativistic case, the time evolution semigroup generalizes to a semigroup of spacetime
translations into the forward light cone, which is invariant under the group of orthochronous
Lorentz transformations. In this sense, semigroup time evolution can be viewed as an expres-
sion of causality [39,40]

The rigged Hilbert space (RHS) is a triplet of linear topological spaces
 ⊂H ⊂×,
(1)
which is obtained from a linear space with scalar product  by completing it with
respect to three topologies. A topology τ speciﬁes the deﬁnition of convergence,
and when a space is completed with respect to a topology τ, the τ-limit elements of
Cauchy sequences are adjoined to the space. For example, in (1) the space H is an
abstract Hilbert space, i.e. it is the completion of  with respect to the topology τH
given by the norm ||φ|| = √(φ, φ). The space  is the completion with respect to a
stronger topology τ and the space × is the space of continuous functionals on .
