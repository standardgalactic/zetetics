This work shows that any k-local Hamiltonian of qubits can be obtained from a 4-state ‘Ising’
model with k-local diagonal interactions and a single-site transverse ﬁeld—giving a new theoretical
and experimental handle on quantum matter. In particular, the classical Ising interactions can be
determined by replacing each Pauli operator with a 4 × 4 diagonal matrix. Subsequently tuning
a large transverse ﬁeld projects out two of the four states, recovering the original qubit model,
with qudit generalizations. This leads to striking correspondences, such as the spin-1/2 XY and
Heisenberg models arising from the large-ﬁeld limit of 3-state and 4-state Potts models, respectively.
Similarly, the Kitaev honeycomb model emerges from classical interactions which enforce loop states
on the honeycomb lattice.
These generalized Ising models also display rich physics for smaller
ﬁelds, including quantum criticality and topological phases of matter. This work expands what is
experimentally achievable by showing how to realize any quantum spin model using only diagonal
interactions and a tuneable ﬁeld—ingredients found in, e.g., tweezer arrays of Rydberg atoms or
polar molecules.
More broadly, 4-state spins can also be encoded in the positions of itinerant
particles, exempliﬁed by a Bose-Hubbard model realizing the Kitaev honeycomb model—giving an
experimental path to its Z2 and non-Abelian topological quantum liquids.

INTRODUCTION
The transverse-ﬁeld Ising model [1, 2] is one of the
most elegant many-body quantum systems. While it is
simple enough to be exactly solvable in 1D and serve
as a workhorse for higher-dimensional numerical simula-
tions, its richness is archetypal for quantum magnetism
and universality. Although its original raison d’ˆetre was
to exemplify ordered states of matter, the turn of the
millennium showed that adding frustration to the Ising
model leads to exotic physics [3–15]. On the experimental
front, Rydberg atom tweezer arrays [16–19]—which can
now realize 2D [20–24] and higher-dimensional geome-
tries [25, 26]—are well-described by the quantum Ising
model. This has recently led to a resurgence in the study
of its phase diagram on various lattices [27–40], some-
times even leading to topological order [41].
This plethora of phenomenology raises the question:
what can the quantum Ising model (not) do?
A main

constraint is that it is sign-problem-free1; while this is an
advantage for simulating the model with quantum Monte
Carlo [42], it implies that many (indeed, most) phases of
matter cannot arise as its ground state [43–46]. One un-
derappreciated way of removing this restrictive property
is by simply going beyond qubits: e.g., a magnetic ﬁeld
on a three-level system allows for cycles with nonzero
phase factors2; see Fig. 1. In this work, we show that
this minimal change to the quantum Ising model encom-
passes all other bosonic models with ﬁnite-dimensional
on-site Hilbert spaces! Indeed, any quantum spin model
is shown to arise as the large-ﬁeld limit of such a general-
ized Ising model—generically on 4-state spins, although
sometimes three states suﬃce.
The relationship we establish between an arbitrary
quantum spin model and an Ising model is quite direct
and user-friendly. Let us ﬁrst observe that without loss of
generality, we can restrict to spin-1/2 magnets. Indeed, a
qudit can always be identiﬁed with (a subspace of) multi-
ple qubits, which preserves spatial locality of interactions
whilst potentially introducing multi-body terms3. For an
arbitrary spin-1/2 model, the idea is then to simply re-
place the Pauli operators σα by certain diagonal oper-
ators Zα. While this ‘unquantization’ gives a classical
model which is seemingly unrelated to the original quan-
tum model, we show that the spin-1/2 model re-emerges
upon adding a large transverse ﬁeld. This simple pre-
scription distinguishes it from other works on universal
models [47–52], which typically involve rather nonlocal
encodings and deep proofs based on complexity theory.
The cost we pay for such a direct relationship is that if we
wish to obtain a k-local qubit model, the corresponding
Ising model is also k-local; we thus do not reduce multi-
body quantum spin models to a two-body Ising model.
The consequences are at least twofold. Firstly, it es-
tablishes a conceptual connection between quantum and
classical interactions, leading to new rich models ripe for
exploration. After stating our general results (Sec. II),
we showcase this for various paradigmatic quantum mag-
nets. In the case of the XY (Sec. III A) and Heisenberg
(Sec. III B) magnets, we ﬁnd that their phenomenology
can persist to the regime where the classical interac-
tions are dominant. For instance, staggering a 4-state
Potts chain can stabilize a symmetry-protected topologi-
cal (SPT) phase [53–59], even for arbitrarily small trans-
verse ﬁelds.
The present work also further explores a
connection between the Kitaev honeycomb model and
the 4-state Ising interactions which realize a dimer liq-
uid [60–66], which the author recently established in
collaboration with Ashvin Vishwanath [39].
We show
1 To wit, this means that there exists a basis where oﬀ-diagonal
operators have only negative coeﬃcients.
2 The author thanks Ashvin Vishwanath for an illuminating dis-
cussion on this point.
3 Alternatively, such multi-body interactions could be avoided by
instead obtaining a p-local q-state quantum model from a p-local
q2-state transverse ﬁeld Ising model; see Sec. V.

13 has a nonzero phase
factor, the Ising model is not stoquastic (it has a so-called
‘sign-problem’), allowing for the emergence of rich physics.
Indeed, this work shows that higher-state Ising models can
replicate all phenomena in quantum magnetism.
that this provides a solvable model for studying the in-
terpolation between symmetry-enriched Z2 spin liquids
[62, 67–77] where we ﬁnd an intervening non-Abelian
phase (Sec. III C). A second consequence is that these
generalized Ising models provide an alternative and min-
imal framework for experimentally realizing various mod-
els of interest, which we illustrate in Sec. IV for Rydberg
and dipolar systems.

FROM QUANTUM SPIN MODEL TO ISING
MODEL AND BACK
In this section we present the general results. We refer
the reader who prefers an example-based approach to
Sec. III, which contains several ﬂeshed-out case studies.
A.
General case: 4-state model
We consider an arbitrary lattice Λ of spin-1/2’s, where
each site has Pauli operators satisfying the algebra
[σz
j , σ+
j ] = σ+
j and [σ+
j , σ−
j ] = σz
j . An arbitrary Hamilto-
nian can be written as a function which is linear in the
Pauli operators for each site:

(E.g., f({aj, bj, cj}) = P
⟨i,j⟩(aibj + biaj) gives the XY
model; see Sec. III for more examples.) We associate to H
a generalized 4-state Ising model ˜H (on the same lattice)
by replacing the Pauli operators by diagonal ones:

One can show that the large-ﬁeld limit projects each site
into the low-energy doublet of X, thereby recovering H:
˜H
λ→∞
−−−−→P ˜HP = H.
(4)
(The phase eiφ in Eq. (2) can be chosen freely. We
note that hermiticity of H ensures that ˜H is hermitian.
Moreover, if H is real, then ˜H with φ = 0 has an anti-
unitary symmetry4. Nevertheless, it can sometimes be
useful to take φ ̸= 0; see Sec. III C.)

that the spectrum of X is {

Intuition
While the above proof is rigorous, it is ad hoc. Here
we present an alternative approach, which can provide
some intuition and can perhaps serve as a basis for future
generalizations.
Let σα=x,y,z and τ α=x,y,z denote Pauli matrices. If we
deﬁne Zα = −σα ⊗τ α, then these three 4 × 4 matrices
clearly mutually commute, and hence they can be simul-
taneously diagonalized. (In fact, these can be related to
the three diagonal matrices in Eq. (6).) However, if we
impose a large energetic term λ P

In this limit, we can substitute τ α →τ/
√
3 = −1/
√

Hence, as λ →∞, we have that Zα →σα/

3, i.e., the
diagonal matrices reduce to Pauli matrices.
To summarize the basic idea which could be more gen-
erally applicable: one can pair up non-commuting ma-
trices into commuting (and hence diagonal) ones, after
which single-site energetics can freeze out one of the two
to recover the original non-commuting algebra.
C.
Special case: 3-state model
In certain cases (e.g., the XY model) the interactions
do not use all three Pauli components. Here we show that
such models can be obtained from a generalized Ising
model on a 3-state spin, rather than the more general
4-state spin above.
In particular, suppose we have

that

If hj = 0, the third Pauli component never appears,
and then ˜H is manifestly real. Indeed, the diagonal term
is always real due to hermiticity.

EXAMPLES
Here we illustrate the above general results for a few
archetypal models of quantum magnetism.

Spin-1/2 XY model
Let us ﬁrst consider the spin-1/2 XY model, H =

(12)
The classical interactions are those of a Potts model,
which has an S3 symmetry permuting the three states.
We see that for large λ, the single-site ﬁeld projects out
the state
1
√
3 (|0⟩+ |1⟩+ |2⟩), giving an eﬀective qubit
model. More precisely, Eq. (10) says that if λ →+∞
we obtain the spin-1/2 XY model, where S3 ∼= Z3 ⋊Z2
is enhanced to O(2) ∼= U(1) ⋊Z2 symmetry.
To gain some more insight into the physics of this
model, let us discuss the 1D case.
The spin-1/2 XY
chain is exactly solvable [78] and is described by a con-
formal ﬁeld theory (CFT) at low energies [79], namely,
the compact boson CFT or Luttinger liquid with param-
eter K = 1 [80]. The scaling dimension of the charge-3
operator is
9
4K = 9
4, which is larger than the spacetime di-
mension and hence irrelevant. This shows that the CFT
is robust even away from the λ →+∞limit. In fact,
one can perform a more detailed analysis involving per-
turbation theory (see Appendix A) which suggests that
for J > 0, the gapless phase and its emergent U(1) sym-
metry is stable for all ﬁeld strengths λ > 0. This agrees
with a recent numerical study [81]. Hence, one can in-
terpret the robust gapless phase of the antiferromagnetic
3-state Potts chain as essentially realizing the spin-1/2
XY chain.

cording to Sec. II A, this arises as the large-ﬁeld limit of

(14)
We recognize this as the 4-state Potts model with an un-
usual complex-valued ﬁeld (3). The latter is unavoidable
if one wants to recover such spin-1/2 models in the large-
ﬁeld limit: the Pauli algebra [σα, σβ] = 2iεαβγσγ involves
complex numbers, whereas diagonal hermitian matrices
(such as those in Eq. (6)) are real. To gain some gen-
eral insight into this novel Potts model, let us discuss its
symmetries and related anomalies.

FIG. 2. Spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain and Haldane SPT
phase from an antiferromagnetic Potts model. (a) We
consider a 4-state Potts model (14) where neighbors experi-
ence an energy cost J > 0 if they are in the same state; a
complex ﬁeld (3) generates resonances.
For large ﬁeld, we
obtain the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, described by the Wess-
Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)1 conformal ﬁeld theory. (b)
We numerically ﬁnd that this criticality persists to all values
of the ﬁeld, stabilized by the A4 ⊂SO(3) symmetry of the
Potts chain. Moreover, staggering the Potts interactions leads
to an SPT phase protected by A4. (c) The (non)trivial SPT
phases can be detected by string order parameters; shown for
λ = J. (d) At the translation-invariant point, entanglement
scaling is consistent with central charge c = 1. (e) Similarly
we conﬁrm the scaling dimension ∆= 1/2 of the spin operator
in the WZW CFT (with logarithmic corrections [82–84]).
Symmetries. The 4-state model in Eq. (13) has a Z2 ×
Z2 symmetry generated by Q
j U α=y,z
j
where
U y =


0 1


.
(15)
In the limit λ →+∞, this corresponds to the Z2 × Z2
symmetry of the spin-1/2 XXZ model. The isotropic case
(14) has an enhanced symmetry: Potts interactions have
a natural S4 symmetry, which is broken down to A4 by
the complex ﬁeld, as described in Appendix B. There
we also deﬁne an anti-unitary symmetry such that we
have A4 ⋊ZT
2 ∼= ST
4 . When λ →+∞, the discrete A4
symmetry corresponds to the tetrahedral subgroup of the
SO(3) symmetry of the Heisenberg model.
Anomalies. In spin-1/2 models, spin-rotation acts pro-
jectively on a single spin.
This continues to hold for
our generalized 4-state Ising models. For instance, U y
and U z deﬁned in Eq. (15) anticommute on a single site.
Similarly, Eq. (14) is symmetric under a projective repre-

5
sentation of A4, distinguishing it from the usual 4-state
Potts model with a real ﬁeld. Such symmetries can give
powerful constraints on the phase diagram. For instance,
when combined with certain spatial symmetries, pro-
jective symmetry actions are ‘anomalous’ [78, 85–103],
meaning that the ground state cannot be a trivial sym-
metric phase of matter. One rich example is a square
lattice of spin-1/2’s with C4 rotation symmetry:
this
anomaly stabilizes a direct non-Landau transition be-
tween a valence bond solid and N´eel state—a ‘deconﬁned
quantum critical point’ (DQCP) described by a puta-
tive SO(5) ﬁeld theory [104–111]. Such phenomena can
thus be explored in 4-state Ising models, even away from
the large-ﬁeld limit.
In fact, even though ﬁnite λ re-
duces SO(3) to A4, this symmetry stabilizes the DQCP
[99, 109, 112].
1D case—criticality. Let us study the physics of the
4-state Potts chain (14), as shown in Fig. 2(a). In the
limit λ →+∞, this is the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with
a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly [78] due to spin-rotation
and translation symmetry. The ground state is a Lut-
tinger liquid at the SU(2)-symmetric K = 1/2 [80, 113].
The A4 symmetry stabilizes this anomaly and critical-
ity to ﬁnite λ. Remarkably, we ﬁnd that this holds for
all λ > 0 via numerical density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) [114, 115] simulations using the TeNPy
library [116]. A moderate bond dimension χ = 150 was
suﬃcient to obtain converged results for Fig. 2. We ob-
serve the expected central charge based on entanglement
scaling [117, 118], and even the spin-spin correlations as-
sociated to K = 1/2 [82–84]. The microscopic A4 sym-
metry thus gives a low-energy emergent SU(2) symmetry.
1D case—Haldane SPT. The aforementioned anomaly
is related to how staggering the Potts interactions,
P
n(1 + b(−1)n)δn,n+1,
gives
rise
to
two
distinct
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected
by A4.
(Indeed, one can interpret single-site transla-
tion as an SPT-entangler.) Similar to the Su-Schrieﬀer-
Heeger chain [119], it is conventional to ﬁx a two-site unit
cell [120, 121] say (2n−1, 2n), after which b < 0 (b > 0) is
the trivial (topological) phase. This is evidenced by the
trivial string order parameter ⟨Q
i<m<j U z
2m−1U z
2m⟩hav-
ing long-range order only for b < 0; for the SPT phase
we need to include an endpoint operator which is odd
under U y [122], such as Z2; see Fig. 2(c). We have also
conﬁrmed that for b > 0, the entanglement spectrum
is twofold degenerate (not shown), which persists even
upon explicitly breaking bond-centered inversion symme-
try (which is also able to protect the phase [54, 55]). In
the large-ﬁeld limit, this reduces to the bond-alternating
spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, which moreover connects to
the spin-1 Heisenberg chain [55, 123–125] upon making
the intra-unit-cell couplings ferromagnetic [126, 127].
FIG. 3.
Kitaev honeycomb model from a general-
ized transverse-ﬁeld Ising model. The large-ﬁeld limit
λ →∞of Eq. (16) leads to the spin-1/2 Kitaev model.
The isotropic case |Jx| = |Jy| = |Jz| was recently studied
in Ref. 39; here we study the full phase diagram, plotted in
barycentric coordinates |Jx| + |Jy| + |Jz| = 1 for diﬀerent
values of λ ≈0.23, 0.40, 0.56, 0.87, 2.31.
The gapless (‘B’)
phase of the Kitaev model [128] is gapped out into a non-
Abelian chiral phase shown in yellow (see the main text for a
diﬀerent Ising model where the Majorana cones are robust).
The blue regions are the gapped Z2 spin liquid phases of the
Kitaev model. For small ﬁelds (red), the antiferromagnetic
model gives an emergent dimer liquid on the kagom´e lattice
[39] whereas the ferromagnetic case gives a honeycomb loop
model (akin to the toric code state [129]); both are distinct
from the Aα phases in the presence of translation symmetry.

ing 4-state Ising model:
˜H = 3
X
α=x,y,z
Jα
X
⟨i,j⟩α
Zα
i Zα
j + λ
X
j
Xj
(16)
where the diagonal operator Zα is deﬁned in Eq. (6),
and X in Eq. (3). We brieﬂy recall the phase diagram
for λ →+∞, i.e., that of the Kitaev model: there is a
gapless Z2 spin liquid (labeled B in Fig. 3) within the
triangle inequality |Jz| < |Jx| + |Jy| (and permutations
thereof), whereas outside of these bounds there are three
Z2 spin liquids (labeled Aα=x,y,z) which are distinct in
the presence of translation symmetry [128].
What is the fate of this celebrated phase diagram if
we make λ ﬁnite? This depends on our choice of φ in
Eq. (6). (In our previous examples this did not arise since
Zi always appeared together with Z†
j .) In Sec. II A we

6
saw that if we choose φ = 0, then ˜H has an anti-unitary
symmetry; this is suﬃcient to stabilize the gapless Z2
spin liquid [128].
Hence, for one choice of generalized
Ising model, the B phase will be robust for some window
λ ≥λc; we leave the study of this model to future work.
Here, we set φ = π
4 : this breaks time-reversal symmetry
for ﬁnite λ and will hence gap out the B phase into a
non-Abelian phase [128], but more importantly, it turns
out to preserve the exact solubility of the Kitaev model
for any λ; see Appendix C. In this case, one can show
that the signs of Jα can be unitarily toggled.
Having set φ = π
4 , let us ﬁrst brieﬂy discuss the classi-
cal limit, i.e., Eq. (16) with λ = 0. There is an extensive
ground state degeneracy ∼
√
2
N, where N is the total
number of sites. Although the signs of Jα can be unitar-
ily toggled, the interpretation of this classical degeneracy
depends on the choice of sign. In the ferromagnetic case
Jα < 0, it is convenient to label the basis states of each
4-state spin as

,
,
,
	
on one sublattice of the
honeycomb lattice and as

,
,
,
	
on the other.
In this case the Ising interaction ferromagnetically glues
together black-to-black and red-to-red, leading to closed
loop states on the honeycomb lattice. In the antiferro-
magnetic case Jα > 0, we follow Ref. 39 in labeling the
four basis states as

,
,
,
	
on one sublattice
and as

,
,
,
	
on the other sublattice. In this
case, the classical ground state degeneracy corresponds
to all dimer coverings of the kagom´e lattice.
In both
cases, turning on inﬁnitesimal quantum ﬂuctuations λ at
the isotropic point J := Jx = Jy = Jz leads to a ground
state which is the equal-weight superposition of all these
classical states; see Fig. 3. For J < 0 we can call this the
toric code state on the honeycomb lattice [129] whereas
for J > 0 it resembles a ﬁxed-point dimer liquid [60–66]
on the kagom´e lattice.
Having explored the λ →+∞and λ →0 limits, the
phase diagram for φ =
π
4 is showcased in Fig. 3 for
ﬁve representative values of λ. Let us ﬁrst focus on the
isotropic case |Jx| = |Jy| = |Jz| =
1
3, which was re-
cently studied5 in Ref. 39: as we decrease λ, the non-
Abelian phase has a transition at λc =
1
√
3, below which
we enter the small-λ phase discussed above, i.e., the toric
code on the honeycomb lattice (Jα < 0) or the kagom´e
dimer liquid (Jα > 0). This raises the question of what
happens for the anisotropic model: is this Z2 spin liq-
uid connected to one of the Aα phase(s) of the Kitaev
model? No: translation symmetry acts diﬀerently on the
anyons—the Aα phases exhibit ‘weak’ translation sym-
metry breaking since the e- and m-anyons live on alter-
nating rows of the honeycomb lattice [128], whereas in
the low-λ phase the hexagons only support m-anyons.
5 Ref. 39 also discusses how this can be related to the Yao-Kivelson
model [130].
We say they form distinct ‘symmetry-enriched topolog-
ical’ (SET) phases. Remarkably, Fig. 3 shows that any
interpolation between these two Z2 SETs gives rise to an
intermediate non-Abelian chiral phase.
In Sec. IV C we explore an alternative (generalized)
Ising model for realizing the Kitaev model. This will no
longer be exactly solvable, but its interactions are ar-
guably more straightforward to experimentally realize.
IV.
EXPERIMENTAL RELEVANCE AND
GENERALIZATIONS
A.
General comments
The fact that any quantum spin model can be obtained
from the large-ﬁeld limit of a (generalized) Ising model
gives a new handle on quantum simulators and materi-
als. We stress that there is considerable ﬂexibility in how
this idea can be applied. Firstly, while our results show
that having (only) diagonal interactions is suﬃcient to
generate any eﬀective oﬀ-diagonal interaction (at the ex-
pensive of reducing the on-site Hilbert space dimension),
this does not imply that it would be problematic if a given
experimental set-up also has oﬀ-diagonal interactions. In
fact, this can help: projecting these additional terms into
the low-energy subspace can increase the number of avail-
able interactions, which can lessen the requirements on
the original Hilbert space dimension (we will see an ex-
ample of this in Sec. IV B).
Secondly, thus far we explored two particular choices of
ﬁelds (Eq. (3) and Eq. (9)). Having such concrete choices
allowed us to present general plug-and-chug formulas in
Sec. II. Moreover, these particular ﬁelds gave useful sym-
metry properties in Secs. III A and III B, and led to the
solvable model in Sec. III C. However, in an experimen-
tal context one might want to explore a broader choice of
ﬁelds. The key property to retain is that the ﬁeld must
have a doublet low-energy subspace. This means that by
tuning a (strong) single-site ﬁeld, one can obtain many
diﬀerent eﬀective quantum spin models from the under-
lying interactions of a single microscopic model (we will
see examples of this in Secs. IV B and IV C).
We will now discuss two examples of experimental pro-
posals.
These happen to be in the context of analog
quantum simulators. (In a sense that brings us full circle,
since the present work is a generalization of the recently
established connection between dimer models and Kitaev
physics [39] which in turn was inspired by recent Rydberg
atom array theory [30] and experiment [22].) However,
these ideas can equally well be explored in quantum ma-
terials. A particularly exciting direction for future work
is that of novel Van der Waals heterostructures [131–133],
which enjoy a great degree of tunability and where (eﬀec-
tive) higher-state models can naturally arise [134–137].

FIG. 4. Generalized Ising model in a Rydberg tweezer
array. (a) In experiments on Rydberg atom tweezer arrays
[16–19], one often encodes a qubit in the ground state (g.s.)
and a Rydberg state nS. Virtual photons couple to the large
transition dipole moment of the latter, inducing an Ising (i.e.,
diagonal) interaction ∼Unn. (b) We propose to realize a gen-
eralized (here three-state) Ising model by including an extra
Rydberg state ˜nS. In addition to Unn and U˜n˜n (as in (a)), we
also obtain a diagonal interaction Un˜n. If |n −˜n| > 1, there
is no oﬀ-diagonal interaction. (c) Driving a strong single-site
ﬁeld can (eﬀectively) couple the three levels. As derived in
Sec. II C, large λ will transmute the diagonal Ising interac-
tions into a spin-1/2 quantum magnet (20).
B.
Rydberg atom tweezer arrays
In the introduction, we already mentioned how Ryd-
berg atom tweezer arrays [16–19] can naturally realize a
quantum Ising model. More precisely, the eﬀective spin-
1/2 is deﬁned by the ground state |g.s.⟩and a highly
excited Rydberg state |nS⟩of a trapped Alkali atom. If
two nearby atoms are in the |nS⟩⊗|nS⟩state, they expe-
rience an interaction energy6 Unn ∼n11 (see Fig. 4(a)).
Since lasers give us an arbitrarily tunable single-site ﬁeld,
we arrive at the Ising model in a transverse and longitu-
dinal ﬁeld.
A minimal change for obtaining a generalized Ising
model is to consider a second Rydberg level |˜nS⟩. By
virtue of the above discussion, if two nearby atoms are in
the |˜nS⟩⊗|˜nS⟩state, they experience an energy cost U˜n˜n.
Moreover, the state |nS⟩⊗|˜nS⟩(and its mirror) generi-
cally also gives a nonzero energy Un˜n (see Fig. 4(b)). If
|n −˜n| > 1, there are no oﬀ-diagonal terms7.
In conclusion, we have a three-state Ising model for the
qutrit {|g.s.⟩, |nS⟩, |˜nS⟩}. It is a straightforward exercise
(see Appendix E) to write the two-body terms in terms
of the diagonal qutrit operator Z deﬁned in Eq. (9) (with
6 There is a spatial dependence ∼1/r6 which we suppress for no-
tational convenience. Moreover, in a wide range of circumstances
it is suﬃcient to focus on nearest-neighbor interactions; however,
sometimes longer-range terms can be important [22, 28–30, 33].
7 This is due to nP ̸= (˜n −1)P in Fig. 4(b) where n < ˜n. Oﬀ-
diagonal interactions must thus couple through higher levels,
making them typically negligible.

By virtue of the general results in Sec. II C, we can trans-

deﬁned in Eq. (9). In the limit of large
λ, Eq. (10) tells us we can replace Zi →σ+

be tuned):

with the coupling constants given in Eqs. (18) and (19).
The values of Unn, U˜n˜n, Un˜n (and thus J+−, J++) de-
pend on atomic physics, such as choices of n and the
Alkali atom. For generic choices, both J++ and J+−will
be nonzero and comparable. However, using the Python
package arc [138], we calculate (see Appendix E) that
choosing, e.g., Potassium atoms [139] with n = 56 and
˜n = 58 gives |J+−| < 0.003J++ (similarly for n = 89 and
˜n = 92). Hence, we obtain a pure pair-creation Hamil-
tonian H ∝P
⟨i,j⟩σ+
i σ+
j + h.c.. In fact, for a bipartite
lattice (e.g., square or honeycomb lattice), this is uni-
tarily equivalent to the spin-1/2 XY model, whereas for
non-bipartite lattices (e.g., triangular or kagome lattice)
this is a distinct strongly-interacting model. We provide
more details (including for Rydberg and Cesium atoms)
in Appendix E.
The above is primarily an illustrative example of how
the general approach in Sec. II can be used to implement
quantum magnets in Rydberg atom tweezer arrays. Nev-
ertheless, even this minimal case of implementing an XY-
type model has certain advantages over alternative meth-
ods. In particular, there is a natural spin-ﬂop Hamilto-
nian if one encodes a spin-1/2 in a {|nS⟩, |nP⟩} qubit
[18], but this leads to ∼1/r3 dipolar tails which can be
challenging for exotic states of matter with small energy
gaps, and in addition, the spatial anisotropy of p-states
prevent a direct 3D implementation. In contrast, our ef-
fective quantum magnet has much more rapidly decaying
∼1/r6 Van der Waals corrections, and it can be used for
3D geometries8. However, by far the biggest advantage
is the tunability. For instance, it is straightforward to
8 These two advantages are also shared by a {|nS⟩, |(n + 1)S⟩}
encoding [140], although this comes with XXZ anisotropy and
has not been shown to implement pure XY -interaction.

tune single-site ﬁelds, and we can thus consider, e.g., the
following ﬁeld for our above Rydberg-encoded qutrit:
λ


−sin2 θ
cos2 θ
cos θ
cos2 θ
−sin2 θ cos θ
cos θ
cos θ
0

.
(21)
For θ = 0 this reduces to the ﬁeld we used to transform
the diagonal Rydberg interactions (17) into the spin-1/2
Hamiltonian (20). For θ = π
2 , large λ instead projects
out the |˜nS⟩state, where we thus recover the usual spin-
1/2 Ising Hamiltonian. Hence, in the large λ regime, one
obtains an eﬀective spin-1/2 model with a free parameter
θ which tunes between XY and Ising interactions! It is
a remarkable property of our mechanism that tuning a
laser can lead to such tunable quantum spin interactions.
More generally, the results in Sec. II can be used to
realize a wide variety of quantum magnets.
Firstly, if
one sets |n −˜n| = 1, the qutrit model will also have
oﬀ-diagonal interactions; projecting these into the ef-
fective qubit space (for large λ) gives a term propor-
tional to
1
3σx
i σx
j + 1
4σz
i σz
j , thus shifting J+−and J++
equally, and introducing an XXZ anisotropy. Secondly,
including yet another Rydberg level gives us a 4-state
spin, and Sec. II A shows us how its diagonal interac-
tions can be used to realize arbitrary spin interactions.
Thirdly, if one desires spatially anisotropic spin interac-
tions (like the Kitaev honeycomb model [128]), one can
leverage the anisotropic Van der Waals interactions of
p-states. In particular, using a 4-state spin encoded in
{|g.s.⟩, |nPx⟩, |nPy⟩, |nPz⟩} can be used to simulate spin-
1/2 quantum magnets arising from strong spin-orbit cou-
pling [141]. It would be interesting to characterize and
explorate these eﬀective Hamiltonians in future work.
C.
Kitaev model from the Bose-Hubbard model
Finally, we show how the general results of Sec. II can
be used in the context of physical systems which might
not obviously look like Ising models. In addition, we will
illustrate how one can leverage the freedom in choosing
the on-site ﬁeld to make the results of this work broadly
applicable.
In this section, we consider the case of an eﬀective
4-state spin.
In Sec. II A, we saw how the complex-
valued ﬁeld (3) can transform diagonal interactions into
oﬀ-diagonal ones.
In particular, it maps the diagonal
operator Z = eiφdiag(1, i, −1, −i) →σ+. However, by
changing the ﬁeld direction, one can change this corre-
spondence. In Appendix D 1 we show a whole continuous
family of such ﬁelds. Here we would like to focus on one
particular ﬁeld direction identiﬁed there:

FIG. 5.
Kitaev magnet from Bose-Hubbard (BH)
model. (a) We consider the BH model (24) on a decorated
honeycomb lattice. Bosons hop only within the triangles, with
complex-valued t (real tc) for green (red) bonds. Between tri-
angles, there is a density-density interaction V (blue); see
main text for a model with only on-site interactions. (b) We
label the four sites within a triangle as c, x, y, z. (c) On each
triangle we put only one boson (purple dot), thereby encoding
a 4-state spin. The nearest-neighbor Hubbard interaction V
thus deﬁnes a generalized Ising model (23) on the honeycomb
lattice.
In the large-hopping limit, we obtain the spin-1/2
Kitaev honeycomb model with J ∝V (see main text).
To understand why this ﬁeld direction is so useful,
let us label the basis states of our 4-state spin as
{|c⟩, |x⟩, |y⟩, |z⟩}.
Let nα=x,y,z = 0, 1 denote whether
the state |α⟩is occupied (i.e., nα |β⟩= δα,β |β⟩). The
useful property of the ﬁeld (22) is that when it domi-
nates, it projects nα →σα (up to a constant).
This
means if that one starts with the following 4-state Ising
model on the honeycomb lattice:
H = V

α=x,y,z

⟨i,j⟩α
nα,inα,j + λ

(23)
(where we use the x, y, z labeling of bonds as in Fig. 3),
then in the λ →+∞limit, we obtain the Kitaev honey-
comb model (up to a tunable ﬁeld)!
Let us show how Eq. (23) can arise from a more familiar
Hamiltonian, like the Bose-Hubbard model:
HBH =

⟨i,j⟩
ti,jb†
ibj +

Ui,jninj +

(24)
In addition to the usual on-site repulsive interaction
U ≡Ui,i, it will be convenient to also include (only) a
nearest-neighbor interaction V ≡Ui,j
2
(for nearest neigh-
bors i and j).
We note that this is not essential: in
Appendix D 2 we show how V can be perturbatively gen-
erated from hopping and the on-site interaction U; how-
ever, in that case the coupling constants of the eventual
Kitaev honeycomb model will be smaller, and it is thus
experimentally advantageous to have nonzero V at the
outset. We will ﬁrst explore the physics of this model,
and then discuss potential experimental realizations.
Our lattice will be a decorated honeycomb lattice
which can be interpreted as an overlay of the honeycomb

9
and star (or Fisher) lattices; see Fig. 5(a). In the minimal
scenario9, we have nonzero hopping only within each tri-
angle of the lattice: the red bonds have a strength tc =
aλ =

3λ whereas the green bonds are complex
with strength t = bλ =

12 λ. If each trian-
gle is occupied by exactly one boson, we obtain a 4-state
spin, which we label by the basis states {|c⟩, |x⟩, |y⟩, |z⟩}
(see Fig. 5), with the hopping and chemical potential en-
coding an eﬀective ﬁeld (22). Then the nearest-neighbor
interaction10 V indeed realizes the model in Eq. (23).
Details are worked out in Appendix D 2, where we show
that the large-λ limit of HBH gives the Kitaev honey-
comb model H = J P

with J =

3)2 (where it is worth noting that J is ﬁrst-order
in V ). Naturally, if the interaction V is bond-dependent,
we can explore the full phase diagram of the Kitaev hon-
eycomb model. Moreover, we can tune a single-site term
to achieve the non-Abelian quantum spin liquid (see Ap-
pendix D 2).
Let us now discuss several experimental routes to-
wards realizing this Bose-Hubbard model, focusing on
cases where the nearest-neighbor interaction is explicitly
present and does not need to be generated at second-
order in perturbation theory.
One natural way of obtaining such extended Bose-
Hubbard interactions is dipolar physics [148–150].
In-
deed, experiments on optical lattices [151, 152] have
observed non-onsite interactions between, e.g., atoms
with magnetic dipole moments [153] and molecules with
electric dipole moments [154].
Moreover, several ex-
perimental tools for generating complex-valued hopping
are known [155–158]. More recently, tweezer arrays for
molecules have been developed [159, 160] which make
it easier to create exotic lattices; this has been demon-
strated even for polar molecules [161, 162]. We note that
tweezer arrays can accommodate tunnel-coupled hopping
[163–167], such that the ingredients necessary for realiz-
ing the extended Hubbard model on the star-honeycomb
lattice in Fig. 5(a) have been established. It would be
interesting for future work to study the eﬀect of the
longer-range dipolar ∼1/r3 interactions beyond nearest-
neighbors.
Alternatively,
instead
of
using
polar
atoms
or
molecules, one can achieve the desired properties of intra-
triangle hopping and inter-triangle density-density inter-
actions in Rydberg atom tweezer arrays. For instance,
suppose that on upward-(downward-)pointing triangles
of the star-honeycomb lattice in Fig. 5(a), each black
dot denotes a hardcore boson encoded in a {|nS⟩, |nP⟩}
({|˜nS⟩, |˜nP⟩}) qubit. For generic choices of n ̸= ˜n, there
9 We note that perturbative hopping between triangles is not a
problem, since we would eﬀectively stabilize a fractional Mott
insulator [142–147]; see also Appendix D 2.
10 In Fig. 5(a), we only show a nonzero V between triangles. Since
each triangle is occupied by only one boson, the interaction
within a triangle is inconsequential.
will be no resonant ﬂip-ﬂop processes.
We thus have
(diagonal) Van der Waals interactions between triangles
(similar to Sec. IV B). One advantage of this scenario is
that longer-range tails decay as ∼1/r6. It remains to
be seen whether the necessary complex phase factors in
the (intra-triangle) hopping amplitudes can be straight-
forwardly achieved.
V.
OUTLOOK
In this work we have considered ‘generalized’ Ising
models—lattices of q-state spins (i.e., qudits) which are
coupled only by diagonal interactions and are subjected
to a quantum-mechanical single-site ﬁeld.
While the
usual case of 2-state spins (i.e., qubits) has restricted
phenomenology due to it being stoquastic, we have seen
that Ising models for 4-state spins contain all many-body
qubit Hamiltonians by taking a large-ﬁeld limit. In ad-
dition, since any qudit can be embedded into multiple
qubits, a key result of our work is that any Hamiltonian
deﬁned on a collection of qudits arises from a generalized
Ising model. We have illustrated this general result for
a variety of paradigmatic quantum magnets, where we
found rich ground state phase diagrams even for small
ﬁelds, opening up such generalized Ising models as a rich
ﬁeld of study. Moreover, we took the ﬁrst steps towards
proposing novel experiments by utilizing this universal
property of the Ising model.
For instance, this led us
to a way of realizing the Kitaev honeycomb model using
cold atoms or molecules in a way that is radically distinct
from previous proposals [168–174] (as evidenced, e.g., by
the C3 rotation symmetry of the model in Sec. IV C).
One interesting direction for future work is to explore
and characterize the whole space of ﬁeld directions which
can be used to transform a given set of independent
diagonal matrices into a desired Pauli algebra. In Ap-
pendix D 1, we already explored such a family, but a sys-
tematic approach would be welcome. Moreover, while the
present work provides a way of obtaining arbitrary qudit
Hamiltonians from Ising models, this requires embedding
qudits into multiple qubits. Future work could provide ef-
ﬁcient user-friendly correspondences where q-state qudit
Hamiltonians arise from q2-state Ising models. Indeed,
there are q2 −1 non-trivial independent diagonal q2 × q2
matrices, which in the large-ﬁeld limit can be made to
map to the q2 −1 generators of the Lie algebra of SU(q).
In addition to further developing the theoretical frame-
work, it is also worthwhile to explore the physics of these
novel generalized Ising models. In the present work, we
have already seen several surprising results, such as how
a 4-state Potts chain can lead to SPT phases and their
exotic criticality; it would be interesting to explore the
physics of these novel Potts models in two spatial dimen-
sions. Moreover, the solvable Ising model in Sec. III C
generically gave an intervening non-Abelian spin liquid
when tuning between distinct symmetry-enriched Z2 spin
liquids; it is unclear whether this also holds for non-

10
integrable models.
More generally, it would be inter-
esting to study the weak-ﬁeld physics of the generalized
Ising models whose large-ﬁeld limit reproduces known
models of interest. Note that a given quantum model can
correspond to multiple Ising models. E.g., in Sec. III C
we noted that choosing φ = 0 should lead to an alter-
native phase diagram where the gapless Majorana cone
is stable. Moreover, if one starts with quantum models
with multi-body interactions (such as the toric code [129]
or cluster chain [175]), the corresponding Ising model will
also have multi-body interactions, which can lead to in-
teresting physics [176–186].
Finally, there is signiﬁcant experimental promise which
deserves further study. In Sec. IV, we discussed how gen-
eralized Ising models can be implemented in AMO sys-
tems.
For instance, Rydberg atom tweezer arrays can
encode a qudit into multiple states per atom. We iden-
tiﬁed certain set-ups which are achievable in near-term
experiments (most notably Sec. IV B). More broadly, it
would be exciting if the same ideas can be applied to
quantum materials. While the Ising model has a time-
honored connection to solid-state systems [187, 188], a
particularly promising direction is oﬀered by Van der
Waals heterostructures [131–133] which admit a high de-
gree of control, and where eﬀective Ising models [189] and
higher-state descriptions [136, 137] are known to arise.

Appendix A: Emergence of spin-1/2 XY model from 3-state Potts model
1.
Arbitrary dimensions
We analyze the Potts model in Eq. (12), which has the property that for λ →+∞it reduces to the spin-1/2 XY
model. In particular, for large λ, we project each qutrit into a two-state system given by
|↓⟩=
1
√
3


1
ω
¯ω


and
|↑⟩=
1
√
3


1
¯ω
ω

.
(A1)
Projecting Z (deﬁned in Eq. (9) where we choose φ = 0) into this space, we have that PZP = |↑⟩⟨↓| = σ+. Hence, in
leading-order perturbation theory, the 3-state Potts model (12) for large ﬁeld has an eﬀective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian

We can similarly calculate the terms that arise at second order in perturbation theory. For this, we can introduce
the intermediate ‘high-energy’ state
|0⟩=
1
√
3


1
1
1

,
(A3)
which costs an energy E = 3λ ≫|J|, relative to |↑⟩or |↓⟩. We have that
PZ |0⟩⟨0| ZP = |↓⟩⟨↑| ,
PZ† |0⟩⟨0| Z†P = |↑⟩⟨↓| ,
PZ |0⟩⟨0| Z†P = |↓⟩⟨↓|
and
PZ† |0⟩⟨0| ZP = |↑⟩⟨↑| .
(A4)
Passing through this intermediate ‘virtual’ state has three consequences.
Firstly, it gives rise to second-nearest-
neighbor spin-ﬂop terms:
−J2
3λ
X
⟨⟨i,j⟩⟩
 σ+
i σ−
j + h.c.

.
(A5)
Secondly, it leads to explicitly breaking U(1) down to Z3 for three neighboring sites:
−J2

⟨i,jk⟩
 σ+

Lastly, it leads to additional nearest-neighbor XXZ-type interactions:

(A8)
with
Jeﬀ= J −J2
6λ
and
∆= −
1
2λ/J −1/3 = −J
2λ + O((J/λ)2).
(A9)
Observe that Jeﬀ∆< 0, i.e., the XXZ interactions have ferromagnetic tendencies.
2.
One spatial dimension
While Eq. (A8) applies to arbitrary dimensions, here we discuss the resulting physics in the one-dimensional setting.
If we ﬁrst focus on the nearest-neighbor interactions, we observe that we have the integrable XXZ chain [192]. This is
described by a Luttinger liquid with parameter K =
1
2−2
π arccos( ˜∆) [193], where we have to take ˜∆= sgn(Jeﬀ)∆= −|∆|.
A charge-3 operator (such as the last term in Eq. (A8)) becomes relevant when K ≥9
8. The threshold anisotropy is
thus
˜∆= cos

π −π
2K



π −4π



5π


≈−0.174.
(A10)
Using Eq. (A9), this corresponds to
λ
|J| ≈3. For J < 0, we expect that a ﬁeld of this order of magnitude should gap
out the critical phase into a symmetry-breaking phase. Qualitatively this agrees with the numerical study in Ref. 81
although they ﬁnd that the necessary ﬁeld strength diﬀers by a factor of two from our above estimate, suggesting
that we would need to go to higher order in perturbation theory to quantitatively capture this transition.
However, if J > 0, then the spin-ﬂip operator σ+
i (and any odd product of these) has momentum π. Hence, the
last term in Eq. (A8) cannot generate cos(3ϕ) in the ﬁeld theory, but only a descendant thereof (e.g. (−1)n cos(3ϕ) ∼
∂cos(3ϕ)), which cannot gap out the critical phase. Instead, the dominant perturbation allowed by translation and
Z3 symmetry is cos(6ϕ), which has scaling dimension
62
4K . This becomes relevant only for the much larger Luttinger
parameter K ≥9
2. We can surmise that the Hamiltonian under consideration will never reach this value of K: the
antiferromagnetic Potts chain has an integrable point J = λ > 0, which is a Luttinger liquid with K = 3
2 [194–196].
this suggests the following picture for J > 0: for large ﬁelds h →+∞, we have the spin-1/2 XY chain with K = 1, and
as we lower the ﬁeld, K slightly increases, toward the value K = 1.5 at the integrable point h = J. Throughout, there
is no symmetric relevant operator, suggesting a stable gapless phase. Moreover, the remainder of the phase diagram
(i.e., 0 < λ < J) is obtained by using the Kramers-Wannier duality, implying that the gapless phase is stabilized for
all λ, J > 0. This agrees with numerical observations [81].

Alternative derivation of the general theorem
Here we carry out the derivation sketched in Sec. II B, which also makes the connection with Sec. II A more explicit.
Let us ﬁrst introduce:
U x =

Deﬁne σα=x,y,z = −U α and τ α=x,y,z = (U α)∗. One can straightforwardly show that these deﬁne two sets of (mutually
commuting) Pauli algebras, as the notation suggests. If we deﬁne Zα = −σατ α, then we ﬁnd
Zx = U x (U x)∗=

These are thus three diagonal matrices. (Moreover, they coincide with Eq. (6) with φ = π
4 .) However, if we turn on
a large ﬁeld

then for λ →+∞we can everywhere replace

3. In particular, Zα = U α (U α)∗→−U α
√
3 = σα
√
3. We thus
see that in the presence of this large ﬁeld, the three diagonal matrices in Eq. (B2) act like eﬀective Pauli matrices.
Lastly, observe that X = P
α=x,y,z (U α)∗coincides with the expression in Eq. (3). QED.
2.
Explicit emergence of the spin-1/2 model
When λ →+∞, we thus project each 4-state spin into an eﬀective qubit corresponding to X = −
√
3. This eﬀective
qubit can be made more explicit by deﬁning the following basis for this subspace:
|↑⟩=



.
(B4)
One can conﬁrm that the eﬀective action of
√
3Z2 in this basis is σz, whereas
q
3
2eiφZ projects into σ+. Moreover,
if we set φ = π
4 for concreteness, we obtain the following eﬀective actions of the U x,y,z operators deﬁned in Eq. (B1):
U x →−σx,
U y →−σy,
U z →−σz.

Symmetries of 4-state Potts model in a complex ﬁeld
We consider the 4-state Potts model in Eq. (14), which has a particular complex-valued ﬁeld X deﬁned in Eq. (3).
This model has an anti-unitary symmetry ST
4 = A4 ⋊ZT
2 . I.e., odd permutations are anti-unitary, whereas even
permutations are unitary. The single permutations are as follows:

Here K is complex-conjugation. The above permutations are symmetries of Eq. (14). Indeed, clearly the Potts
interaction itself is invariant under any such permutation, and for the on-site ﬁeld one can straightforwardly verify
this by a computation. E.g.,

FIG. 6. Bell pair in two-site Potts model. In the limit of strong bond-alternation of the four-state Potts model in a
complex ﬁeld (14), we only need to solve a two-site problem (B12). (a) We ﬁnd that the ground state is gapped for all λ; this
adiabatically connects to the known singlet ground state of the two-site spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian for λ →+∞. (b)
The ground state is a Bell pair throughout, protected by A4 symmetry which is projective on a single site.
Even permutations (the ‘alternating group’) are implemented in a unitary way, which can be obtained from the
above expressions. E.g., cyclically permuting the ﬁrst three elements corresponds to
U123 = S12S23 = U12U ∗

Note that by comparing to Eq. (B1), we see that U x = iU(14)(23), U y = iU(12)(34) and U z = U(13)(24).
We observe that A4 ⊂SO(3) has a projective representation on a single site. To see this, note that in A4, the
permutation (12)(34) commutes with (13)(24), whereas here we ﬁnd U(12)(34)U(13)(24)U †
(12)(34)U †
(13)(24) = −1. This
captures the fact that the subgroup Z2 × Z2 ⊂A4 is (projectively) represented as a dihedral group. One can also
observe the projective action for the cyclic permutations. E.g., in A4 the product (123)(124) is an order-two element,
whereas here we ﬁnd U123U124 to be an element of order four. In fact, A4 does not have any element of this order.
Indeed, this non-trivial projective representation of A4 eﬀectively deﬁnes a faithful linear representation of SL(2, 3)
(the double cover of A4).
4.
Exactly-solvable SPT model
In Sec. III B of the main text, we saw that the bond-alternating 4-state Potts chain (in a complex ﬁeld) eﬀectively
realizes the Haldane SPT phase. Here we brieﬂy comment on its exactly-solvable limit, where the bond-alternation
is so strong that there is no intra-unit-cell coupling (i.e., b = 1 in the notation of the main text). In this limit, the
system eﬀectively reduces to a two-site problem:
˜H = 3Jδ1,2 + λ (X1 + X2) .
(B12)
In the limit λ →+∞, this gives rise to H = J ⃗S1 · ⃗S2. This spin-1/2 problem has four energy levels: the ground-state
singlet, with a gap J to three degenerate triplet states. In particular, there is a ln 2 entanglement upon bipartitioning
the ground state singlet. It turns out that these properties are remarkably robust. Indeed, we can solve Eq. (B12)

18
by diagonalizing the corresponding 42-dimensional matrix. The energy spectrum above the ground state is plotted in
Fig. 6(a); we observe that there is always a nonzero energy gap. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the entanglement spectrum
of the ground state only contains two levels, which are exactly degenerate due to the projective A4 action on a single
site, as discussed in the previous subsection; this leads to the robust ln 2 entanglement plotted in Fig. 6(b).
In conclusion, the ground state is a Bell pair for all values of λ > 0 !

where Zj and Xj are deﬁned in Eq. (3), and we take the particular choice φ = π

Zα in Eq. (B2). The interest in this generalized Ising model is that in the limit λ →+∞, it reduces to the Kitaev
honeycomb model [128]; see Eq. (4). For ease of notation and discussion, we will set Jα > 0, but we note that this
sign can be unitarily toggled.
1.
Free-fermion solution
Here we largely follow Ref. 39, although some of the details are worked out in a diﬀerent way, and moreover, the
phase diagram had so far only been obtained in the isotropic case Jx = Jy = Jz. Each 4-state spin can be described
in terms of six Majorana operators [128, 197–212] with a parity condition, ibxbybzcxcycz = 1. The three commuting
operators Zα in Eq. (B2) can then be expressed as Zα = ibαcα; indeed note that the right-hand is hermitian and
squares to the identity. Moreover, in Sec. C 2 we prove that we can equate:
X = −i (cxcy + cycz + czcx) .
(C3)

(C4)
Here ˆujk is a conserved quantity. We numerically ﬁnd that the ground state lies in the sector ujk = 1, where we take
the convention that it points from the A sublattice to the B sublattice. This agrees with the large-λ limit (which
reduces to the spin-1/2 Kitaev model [128] as explained in the main text) and perturbation theory in the small-λ
limit [39], and the isotropic case which is equivalent to the Yao-Kivelson model [130], all of which are known to be
ﬂux-free.
We thus obtain an eﬀective-free fermion Hamiltonian, which in momentum space is described by:

This suggests the following picture: within the ‘B region’ of the Kitaev model (i.e., where the triangle inequalities
such as |Jx| ≤|Jy| + |Jy| and permutations thereof are satisﬁed), we have a (known) gapless phase for λ →+∞,
which opens up into a gapped chiral spin liquid for ﬁnite λ, until we reach a critical ﬁeld value
λc =
s
| ˜Jx ˜Jy ˜Jz|
| ˜Jx| + | ˜Jy| + | ˜Jz|
,
(C7)
below which there is a gapped Z2 spin liquid, adiabatically connecting to the kagom´e dimer liquid which is discussed
in detail in Ref. 39 for the isotropic case Jx = Jy = Jz and small h.
In the A region, we start with a Z2 spin liquid for large ﬁelds λ →+∞. For concreteness, let us focus on the Az
region, where |Jz| ≥|Jx| + |Jz|. As we lower the ﬁeld, there will be a ﬁrst transition:
λc1 =
s
| ˜Jx ˜Jy ˜Jz|
| ˜Jz| −| ˜Jx| −| ˜Jy|
,
(C8)
where we enter the chiral spin liquid, and as we continue to lower the ﬁeld, we encounter the same transition we
discussed above for the B region:
λc2 =
s
| ˜Jx ˜Jy ˜Jz|
| ˜Jx| + | ˜Jy| + | ˜Jz|
,
(C9)
into the kagom´e dimer spin liquid. Note that if we approach the B region, then λc1 →+∞. If we instead approach
one of the corners of the triangle phase diagram (i.e., |Jz| →+∞), then λc1, λc2 →
q
| ˜Jx ˜Jy|.
By numerically diagonalizing Eq. (C5) we have conﬁrmed that there no transitions for kx, ky /∈{0, π}. The above
analytic expressions were used to plot the representative phase diagrams in Fig. 3 in the main text.
2.
Proof of Eq. (C3)
Let us choose an eigenbasis for Zα:
ibycy |y, z⟩= Zy|y, z⟩= y|y, z⟩,
ibzcz |y, z⟩= Zz|y, z⟩= z|y, z⟩,
where y, z ∈{−1, 1}.
(C10)
Note that Zx|y, z⟩= yz|y, z⟩since ibxcx = (ibycy) (ibzcz) due to the parity condition. The c-pairing operators toggle
these basis states:
icxcy |y, z⟩= |−y, z⟩,
(C11)
since icxcy anticommutes with ibycy. Eq. (C11) only needs to hold up to phase factors, but such phase factors can be
absorbed into the (re)deﬁnition of our basis basis states. Similarly icycz will toggle |y, z⟩↔|−y, −z⟩, however, now
the phase factors are no longer completely free. To determine the phase factors, we write
icycz |y, z⟩= g(y, z) |−y, −z⟩.
(C12)
Then:
(icxcy) (icycz) |y, z⟩= g(y, z)icxcy |−y, −z⟩= g(y, z) |y, −z⟩
(C13)
but also
(icxcy) (icycz) |y, z⟩= −(icycz) (icxcy) |y, z⟩= −icycz |−y, z⟩= −g(−y, z) |y, −z⟩.
(C14)
We thus conclude that g(−y, z) = −g(y, z).
Moreover, since the operator squares to identity, we have that
g(y, z)g(−y, −z) = 1.
This ﬁxes the phase factors: if we set g(1, 1) = 1 then g(−1, 1) = −1 = g(1, −1) and
g(−1, −1) = g(1, 1) = 1.
Note that iczcx = i (icxcy) (icycz), hence the third c-pairing operator is ﬁxed by the ﬁrst two.

20
We can now write down the matrix representation in the basis {|1, 1⟩, |1, −1⟩, |−1, 1⟩, |−1, −1⟩}. Firstly,
ibycy = Zy =

(C15)
and Zx = ZyZz. This coincides with the matrix representation in Eq. (B2). Secondly, our above analysis for the
c-pairing operators gives us:
icxcy =

Hence:

(C17)
This can be equated with X in Eq. (3) after a change of basis. More precisely, the matrix representation in the
basis {|1, 1⟩, i |1, −1⟩, −|−1, 1⟩, −|−1, −1⟩} is the same for the diagonal Zα operators, but:

Appendix D: Further generalizations
1.
A broader class of 4-state ﬁelds
In Sec. II A of the main text we saw how a particular choice of complex ﬁeld on a 4-state system can give rise to
an eﬀective spin-1/2 such that diagonal operators now act as Pauli operators. (In Appendix B we provided more
details.) Here we consider a generalization of this ﬁeld:
X(q) =





−3q

−i + q
p

−i + q
i + q
q




.
(D1)
We will consider this operator for the range q2 < 1/3. Note that if we set q = 0, then it reduces to the ﬁeld in Eq. (3)
of the main text, i.e., X(0) = X. Also comparing to Eq. (22), we identify X(2 −
√
3) = (2 −
√
3)(2 ˜
X −3I).
It can be readily shown that X(q) has eigenvalues {−
√
3.−
√
3,
√
3,
√
3} and thus satisﬁes X(q)2 = 3. If we add the
above ﬁeld (with a large prefactor) to a 4-state spin, we will project into the low-energy spin-1/2, using the projector

√
3. The special case X(0) coincides with Eq. (3) in the main text. We track how
the three independent density operators nα in Eq. (D2) transform into Pauli operators in the large-ﬁeld limit. (a) We show
the solution which is continuously connected to the result for q = 0 in Eq. (D3). (b) We obtain an equivalent set of results
after a change of basis (i.e., a diﬀerent choice of matrices satisfying the Pauli algebra). The advantage of this basis is that at
q = 2 −
√
3, only a single Pauli operator σα appears after projecting the diagonal operator nα. In Appendix D 2 we use this to
encode the Kitaev interactions using nearest-neigbor density-density interactions in a Bose-Hubbard model; such interactions
can be explicitly present (Sec. D 2 a) or can perturbatively arise from hopping terms (Sec. D 2 b).
If we set q = 0, we have

which is diﬀerent but equivalent way of writing the properties discussed in Sec. II A of the main text. For instance,
Z2 = I4 −2nx −2ny, which thus projects into 1 −1+(σx−σy−σz)/

In the next subsection, we will be interested in a diﬀerent choice of q (which will aid in implementing the Kitaev
honeycomb model using a Bose-Hubbard model): setting q = tan(π/12) = 2 −

PnαP = 1 −σα

(D4)
For completeness, in Fig. 7 we track the coeﬃcients of the Pauli operators in PnαP for the whole family of q2 < 1/3.
In panel (a), we start with the solution in Eq. (D3) for q = 0, and we ﬁnd the continuous family connected to it.
While there is a point where PnαP only contains two of three Pauli operators (i.e., where the red curve vanishes),
it does not directly seem to contain the solution shown in Eq. (D4). It turns out that we have to perform a discrete
change of basis, after which all the solutions in panel (a) are mapped to those in panel (b). In this basis, we indeed
recognize that for q = 2 −
√
3, the coeﬃcients in front of two of the three Paul operators vanish.
2.
Kitaev honeycomb model from Bose-Hubbard model on the star-honeycomb lattice
We consider the Bose-Hubbard model on the star-honeycomb lattice shown in Fig. 5 of the main text.
More
precisely, each ‘site’ of the honeycomb lattice hosts a triangle; the boson can either occupy one of the three corners
(labeled x, y, z) or the center (labeled c). The Hamiltonian is of the form H = Hintra + Hinter, where the ﬁrst piece is
dominant and describes the hopping within a triangle, and the latter piece speciﬁes how the diﬀerent triangles couple.
We consider two illustrative cases: in Sec. D 2 a there is a nearest-neighbor interaction, whereas Sec. D 2 b considers
the more restrictive case of on-site interactions, where the triangles are coupled only by hopping terms. In both cases,
there is a limit where the eﬀective low-energy model is the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model.

(D6)
By changing the separation distances between triangles, the couplings Vx, Vy, Vz can in principle have distinct values.
While we do not require any additional couplings, a generic Bose-Hubbard model might have more terms. Let us
brieﬂy discuss why such additional terms would not aﬀect our discussion:
• There might be a nearest-neighbor interaction ∼V between two sites on the same triangle (i.e., in Hintra). However, we
will only consider ﬁlling each triangle with one boson, and hence this interaction has no eﬀect.
• For the same reason, an on-site Hubbard term Unj,a(nj,a −1) has no eﬀect.
• There might be a boson-hopping term in Hinter. However, if there are repulsive terms U > 0 or V > 0 in a triangle (see
previous bulletin points), then two bosons on a single triangle will have less kinetic energy lowering than if each boson had
their own triangle; hence, in the limit λ →+∞considered below, such boson-hopping will be projected out—at leading
order in perturbation theory, only the diagonal term in Hinter will contribute. (In the absence of the diagonal interaction
in Eq. (D6), such hoppings can lead to the Kitaev model at second-order in perturbation theory; see Sec. D 2 b.)
Let us ﬁrst set the inter-triangle interactions to zero (i.e., Vx = Vy = Vz = 0). We put a single boson on each
triangle, with the following choice of parameters:
tc = 2λ

(D9)
In the limit λ →+∞(where we keep να ﬁnite), each triangle becomes an eﬀective two-level system as discussed
around Eq. (D1) (here q = 2 −
√
3; note that since X(2 −
√
3) = (2 −
√
3)(2 ˜
X −3I) there is a proportionality factor
relative to the parameters in Sec. IV C which can be absorbed by rescaling λ). We thus obtain a spin-1/2 model on
the honeycomb lattice.
Subsequently turning on Hinter and projecting into the low-energy subspace (using Eq. (D4)), we obtain the following
eﬀective spin-1/2 honeycomb Hamiltonian:

Depending on the choice of Jα, this solvable model hosts both a gapped Z2 as well as a gapless spin liquid [128].
Moreover, starting from the latter (e.g., at the isotropic point Jx = Jy = Jz), it is known that adding a small ﬁeld (i.e.,
(3 +
√
3)να ̸= −Vα) perturbs this into a gapped non-Abelian chiral spin liquid, described by Ising anyon topological
order [128].
We note that since we are only considering one particle per triangle, which can moreover not hop oﬀthe triangle,
the above argument and set-up carries over exactly to the spinless Fermi-Hubbard model.

b.
Bose-Hubbard model with only on-site interactions
Here we consider the more restrictive Bose-Hubbard model (i.e., we do not presume any interactions between
distinct sites), with H = Hintra + Hinter on the star-honeycomb lattice given by:
Hintra =

(D14)
Our tactic is to use the hopping term in Hinter to eﬀectively generate the above density-density interactions (D6)
by a second-order process.
On upward-pointing triangles (i.e., ‘A sublattice’ of honeycomb lattice), we use the same set-up as above, i.e., we
put a single boson with the following parameters:
tc = 2λ

µc = 2λ(2

3 −3) −w ≈0.928λ −w.
(D18)
For now we set να = 0. If we take the limit λ →+∞, then only three states remain at ﬁnite energy, namely an eﬀective
spin-1/2 qubit at energy −w (per triangle), and an empty triangle with zero energy. The latter will be important
when we discuss how the inter-triangle boson hopping induces a diagonal term at second order in perturbation theory.
Before we can discuss that, we have to specify the parameters on the other sites.
Let us now consider the downward-pointing triangles (i.e., the other sublattice of the honeycomb lattice). Here
we take U →+∞. (We can similarly take U →+∞on upward-pointing triangles, but in that case there is only
one boson per triangle, such that it has no eﬀect.) Here we load three bosons per triangle (note that our triangles
contain four sites, including the central site). We choose parameters similar to above, except for taking the complex
conjugate, as well as inverting the sign of the chemical potentials:
tc = 2λ

(D22)
Again taking λ →+∞, only three ﬁnite-energy states remain: ﬁrstly, a twofold degenerate ‘spin-1/2’ level with three
bosons per triangle, and at an energy cost w above this there is a product state with four bosons.
Since U →+∞, we have hardcore bosons, and thus eﬀectively we can describe the downward-pointing triangles
as containing a single holon (rather than three bosons). The holon experiences the opposite chemical potential and
magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., it eﬀectively experiences the same hopping and chemical potential as the boson does on the
upward triangles. The net result is just that the inter-triangle hopping in Eq. (D14) now looks like a pair-creation
term. Although this lifts us out of the low-energy space (with an energetic penalty 2w which we take to be large), at
second-order in perturbation theory it generates a diagonal interaction as in Eq. (D6), which is attractive (between the
boson on up-triangles and the holon on down-triangles), with Vα = −(t′
α)

2w . Analogous to the previous subsection, we
thus arrive at an eﬀective spin-1/2 Kitaev model (D11), which is ferromagnetic (if w > 0), with the dictionary:
Jα = −(2 −

(D23)
As a brief summary, the hierarchy of energy scales used above is:
|να| ≪|t′
α| ≪|w| ≪λ ≪U.
(D24)

24
With this hierarchy, the Bose-Hubbard model (even with only on-site interactions!)
can thus realize an exactly-
solvable spin liquid. In particular, setting the chemical potential να =
(t′

2(3+
√
3)w ≈0.106(t′

w
, we obtain the Kitaev
honeycomb model (with zero eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld). To verify that the above algebra does not contain any mistakes,
we have explicitly veriﬁed (for small systems) that, say, the energy gap of the eﬀective Kitaev model agrees well with
what we obtain from exact diagonalization of the original Bose-Hubbard model (for a few random choices of the
tuning parameters which respect the above hierarchy).

Deriving the Hamiltonian
Let ei = 0, 1 (˜ei = 0, 1) denote whether site i is in the |nS⟩(|˜nS⟩) state or not. Finally, gi = 0, 1 denotes whether
the atom is in the ground state; note that gi + ei + ˜ei = 1. In terms of matrices in the basis {|gs⟩, |nS⟩, |˜nS⟩}, we
can write
g =

where we also expressed them in terms of the diagonal operator Z deﬁned in Eq. (9).
Using the deﬁnitions in the main text, the interaction (if |n −˜n| > 1) is well-described by:
V =
X
⟨i,j⟩
(Unneiej + U˜n˜n˜ei˜ej + Un˜n [ei˜ej + ˜eiej]) .
(E2)
Up to single-site terms, we can use gi = 1 −ei −˜ei to rewrite the interaction term as
V =

⟨i,j⟩
(Un˜ngigj + [Unn −Un˜n] eiej + [U˜n˜n −Un˜n] ˜ei˜ej) .

Experimental values from ARC
If we want to quantify the interaction strengths for a particular choice of atoms, we need to specify the relevant
quantum numbers more carefully. The two Rydberg states correspond to:
|nS⟩≡|n, l = 0, j = 1
2, m = 1
2⟩
and
|˜nS⟩≡|n, l = 0, j = 1
2, m = σ 1
2⟩.
(E7)

25
Here σ = ±1 is an additional choice; we will discuss its eﬀects shortly. We used the Python package arc [138]
to calculate the (diagonal) interaction strength for particular choices of Alkali atom type, n, ˜n and σ; in addition,
the interaction depends on the azimutal angle θ between the quantization axis (deﬁning m) and the distance vector
between the two atoms (i.e., for θ = π
2 the atoms are in a plane perpendicular to the quantization axis). More precisely,
we calculate the C6 coeﬃcients which determine the Van der Waals interaction −C6
r6 between two Rydberg states at
a distance r (note that with this convention, C6 > 0 is attractive). I.e., we can equate Unn = −C6(nS, nS)/R6 where
R is the separation between atoms; similarly for U˜n˜n and Un˜n.
Let us ﬁrst consider Potassium (39K). For n = 56, ˜n = 58, σ = 1 and θ = π
2 , we obtain
C6(nS, nS) = 40.43 GHz (µm)6 ,
C6(˜nS, ˜nS) = 60.81 GHz (µm)6 ,
C6(nS, ˜nS) = 100.80 GHz (µm)6 .
(E8)
The fact that C6(nS, nS) + C6(˜nS, ˜nS) −C6(nS, ˜nS) is very small corresponds to the claim in Sec. IV B about the
eﬀective Hamiltonian being dominated by a single interaction term. In addition, we observe that the above result is
almost independent of the choice of σ = ±1. (Indeed, for σ = −1, C6(nS, nS) and C6(˜nS, ˜nS) do not change, and
C6(nS, ˜nS) = 100.38 GHz (µm)6.) Relatedly, we observe that the results are eﬀectively independent of the azimutal
angle θ. The interactions are thus isotropic, which means this can be used to simulate XY magnets in 3D space (see
main text).
We have similarly considered Potassium with n = 89 and ˜n = 92. Here we also ﬁnd C6(nS, nS) + C6(˜nS, ˜nS) −
C6(nS, ˜nS) to be very small. More precisely, again setting σ = 1 and θ = π
2 , we ﬁnd:
C6(nS, nS) = 8218 GHz (µm)6 ,
C6(˜nS, ˜nS) = 11995 GHz (µm)6 ,
C6(nS, ˜nS) = 20337 GHz (µm)6 .
(E9)
We again ﬁnd that the results are only very weakly dependent on σ (and correspondingly θ). For σ = −1, C6(nS, ˜nS) =
20240 (with the other two values of course unchanged). In terms of J++ and J+−in Eqs. (18) and (19), this means
that |J+−|/J++ ≈0.0009.
In contrast to Potassium, we ﬁnd a more signiﬁcant dependence on σ and θ for Cesium and Rubidium. This comes
with advantages and disadvantages. A disadvantage is that it prevents one from using this as a way of simulating the
3D XY model. An advantage is that one can use this dependence to more easily tune such that, e.g., J+−= 0. For
instance, if we consider Rubidium (85Rb) with n = 82, ˜n = 85, σ = −1 and θ = 0.5066, we obtain
C6(nS, nS) = 5584.3 GHz (µm)6 ,
C6(˜nS, ˜nS) = 8504.6 GHz (µm)6 ,
C6(nS, ˜nS) = 14089.2 GHz (µm)6 .
(E10)
This leads to |J+−|/J++ < 0.00002. That being said, one does not have to use the freedom in the azimutal angle to
get a dominant J++. E.g., for Rubidium with n = 81, ˜n = 84, σ = −1 and θ = π
2 , we have that J+−is less than 4%
of J++. Or for Cesium (133Cs) with n = 84, ˜n = 87, σ = −1 and θ = π
2 , we have |J+−|/J++ ≈0.01.
