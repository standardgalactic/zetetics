ABSTRACT 
 
From the perspective of quantum gravity research, since the archetypal quantum gravitational 
object, the black hole, was accidentally found function as a thermodynamic system, it is certainly 
natural to suggest that the secret of quantum gravity may lie in thermodynamic analysis. Until now, 
it was not possible to express the gravitational fine-grained entropy of a black hole using the rules 
of gravity. However, the black holes entropic information formula fills this gap by allowing a semi-
classical gravitational approach to express the gravitational fine-grained entropy of black hole. The 
black holes entropic information formula calculates the entropy of Hawking radiation as the 
entangled information of the initial considered black hole, this down to the quantum level of the 
system, the degrees of freedom describing the black hole, and this independently of the 
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy area law, providing a sufficient microscopic description of how this 
entropy arises, showing that the process of black holes evaporation is consistent with the unitarity 
principle. Also, this approach avoids ultraviolet divergences. These perspectives must be 
understood like the fine-grained entropy formulas discovered by Ryu and Takayanagi. In fact, the 
black hole entropy turns out to be a special case of the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture. The Ryu-
Takayanagi formula being a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of gravity-coupled 
quantum systems. That put the accent on the emergence quantum gravity process through the 
fundamentality of the entangled quantum information.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Information 
 
We start this introduction with a very deep 
analysis of the bottom level of what we call the 
Reality. For that approach, we'll take the "it from 
bit" perspective route. 
"It from bit" perspective symbolizes the idea that 
every item of the physical world has at bottom — 
at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an 
immaterial source and explanation; that what we 
call reality arises in the last analysis from the 
posing of yes-no questions and the registering of 
equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all 
things physical are information-theoretic in origin 
and this is a participatory universe” [1]. 
 
But "It’s one thing to say that measurement 
requires information. It’s another thing to say that 
the thing being measured is created by the 
observer doing the measuring" [2]. 
 
“Based on that view, the entropic information 
theory approach is founded on the bit of 
information such as the number of bits of the 
system, the number of bits necessary to specify 
the actual microscopic configuration among the 
total number of microstates allowed and thus 
characterize the macroscopic states of the 
system under consideration” [3]. 
 
In 1870, Boltzmann introduced the statistical 
entropy perspective who established a new field 
of physics based on the rigorous treatment of a 
large ensembles of microstates that constitute 
thermodynamic systems, the descriptive linkage 
between the macroscopic observation of nature 
and 
the 
microscopic 
view. 
In 
statistical 
mechanics, entropy is formulated as a statistical 
property using probability theory [4]. 
 
The number of arrangements counted by 
Boltzmann entropy reflects the amount of 
Shannon information that would be needed to 
implement any arrangement ... of matter and 
energy; indeed, the thermodynamic entropy and 
Shannon entropy are conceptually equivalent [5]. 
 
We can say that entropy, is information: indeed, 
in the micro-canonical language entropy is 
determined by the number of microstates 
compatible with a given macrostate [6]. 
 
Following Shannon in his celebrated 1948 work 
that started the development of information 
theory, the number of states in which something 
can be, is precisely the definition of “information” 
(more precisely, “lack of information”) [7]. 
 
The macroscopic approach and the statistical 
one was the first approach of the concept of 
information. Indeed, the macrostate formula from 
Boltzmann and his statistical entropy perspective 
has been followed by the statistical ensemble of 
distribution on the microstates approach of 
Gibbs. After what, entropy has been a measure 
allowing to characterize a statistical distribution 
as the probability of event for a specific 
distribution, it is the Shannon perspective of 
information. After this statistical approach of the 
entropy, we arrive at the quantic perspective, we 
dive into quantum physics approach with the 
Planck-Einstein 
relation. 
With 
mass-energy 
equivalence relation from Einstein, we are at 
confluence of the principles of mechanics, 
principle of relativity and electromagnetic theory 
for this quantic way of description of the 
information concept [4].  
 
But we can go further into the exploration of the 
notion of information by introducing the mass-
energy-information 
equivalence 
principle 
[8] 
which following the Landauer’s principle [9] 
propose that a bit of information is not just 
physical, but it has a finite and quantifiable mass 
while it stores information. This assumption can 
be testable with the experimental protocol for 
testing 
the 
mass–energy–information 
equivalence principle [10].  
 
1.2 Entropy Definition 
 
“Statistical entropy is a probabilistic measure of 
uncertainty or ignorance; information is a 
measure of a reduction in that uncertainty” [11]. 
 
We can now develop our proper definition of 
entropy which can be enounced as following: 
 
“The entropy of a thermodynamic system in 
equilibrium measure of the uncertainty as to 
which all its internal configurations compatible 
with its macroscopic thermodynamic parameters 
(temperature, 
pressure, 
etc.) 
are 
actually 
realized” [3]. 
 
1.3 Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium 
 
Here we must emphasize on terms used in this 
definition, 
indeed 
when 
one 
speaks 
of 
thermodynamic system in equilibrium we must 
think about local thermodynamic equilibrium. 

 
 
 
 
Denis; PSIJ, 26(4): 1-16, 2022; Article no.PSIJ.90251 
 
 
 
3 
 
Where equilibrium does not require either local or 
global stationarity. 
 
Each small locality must change slowly enough 
to practically sustain its local Maxwell–Boltzmann 
distribution 
of 
molecular 
velocities. 
Local 
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) means that 
those intensive parameters are varying in space 
and time, but are varying so slowly that, for any 
point, 
one 
can 
assume 
thermodynamic 
equilibrium in some neighborhood about that 
point. In other words, it doesn’t require that every 
small locality must have a constant temperature.  
 
1.4 Black Hole Thermodynamics 
 
Thus, let’s look to the black hole as a 
thermodynamic point of view from Jacob 
Bekenstein saying in substance: “Therefore, the 
decrease in area and entropy is of a statistical 
nature, and is quite analogous to the decrease in 
entropy of a thermodynamic system due to 
statistical fluctuations” [12]. 
 
We see so that Black hole are subject to the 
LTE, in accordance with definition of the entropy 
concept 
from 
the 
theory 
of 
entropic           
information. 
 
The four laws of black hole mechanics, which are 
analogous to those of thermodynamics, were 
originally derived from the classical Einstein 
equation [13]. With the discovery of the Hawking 
quantum radiation [14], it became clear that the 
analogy is in fact an identity [15]. 
 
1.5 Degree of Freedom 
 
Following a thermodynamic analysis of black 
hole, as the archetypal quantum gravitational 
object, the black hole, accidentally turned out to 
just like a thermodynamic system. we can say 
that there are fundamental degrees of freedom, 
considered 
as 
the 
minimum 
number 
of 
coordinates required to specify a configuration, 
that give rise to horizon temperature and entropy 
[3]. 
 
In general, entropy is related to the number of 
possible microstates according to the Boltzmann 
principle:  
 
Where S is the entropy of the system, k 
Boltzmann's constant, and Ω or W is the number 
of microstates. 
W 
= 
number 
of 
states 
or 
microstates, 
characterized by the position and velocity of all 
particles so if we consider that the degree of 
freedom of a system can be viewed as the 
minimum number of coordinates required to 
specify a configuration. So YES ... W reflects the 
degree of freedom of a system [3]. 
 
Concerning 
the 
degree 
of 
freedom, 
the 
Newtonian side of black hole is dictated by the 
fact that the degree of freedom of the system 
reflects the number of states or microstates, 
characterized by the position and velocity of all 
particles; while the quantum relativist side of 
black hole is based on the thermal radiation of 
the black hole’s event horizon which is a place of 
quantum effects. 
 
1.6 Fine-grained 
and 
Coarse-grained 
Entropy 
 
At this level, we can define a fine-grained and 
coarse-grained entropy. “Where fine grained 
entropy is the entropy of the density matrix 
calculated by the standard methods of quantum 
field theory in curved spacetime. In the literature, 
this is often simply called the von Neumann 
entropy” [16]. It is Shannon’s entropy with 
distribution replaced by density matrix. It is 
invariant under unitary time evolution. While the 
coarse-grained entropy is defined as follows: we 
only measure simple observables     And 
consider all possible density matrices which give 
the same result as our system Tr[    ]= Tr[p  ]. 
We then choose the maximal von Neumann 
entropy over possible density matrices S(  ). It 
increases under unitary time evolution, i.e. 
thermodynamics entropy [17]. 
 
2. METHODOLOGY 
 
We start from the hidden thermodynamic of Louis 
De Broglie, where we replace the mass by the 
mass of bit of information [4]. After we used this 
mass of bit of information at the Hawking 
temperature in the framework of the black hole 
thermodynamics and in the perspective of the 
Hawking radiation, the process of evaporation of 
the black hole, we will compare some black hole 
data from all over the black holes scale to 
confirm that the black holes entropic information 
formula 
equal 
to 
the 
Bekenstein-Hawking 
entropy, but, also equal to the Bekenstein bound 
[3]. Results are put in relation to the work of 
Casini from 2008 [18] about Bekenstein and Von 
Neumann entropy, about the fine-grained entropy 
and the coarse grained entropy. After this we will 
put 
in 
relation 
the 
black 
holes 
entropic 
information to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula which 

 
 
 
 
Denis; PSIJ, 26(4): 1-16, 2022; Article no.PSIJ.90251 
 
 
 
4 
 
is a general formula for the fine-grained entropy 
of 
gravity-coupled 
quantum 
systems                        
[17]. 
 
2.1 Contextualization 
 
Here, the link between physical objects and 
entropy/information in the context of black hole 
physics is examined. The relationship between 
the initial information/entropy contained in the 
horizon of black hole and the final entropy carried 
by 
the 
outgoing 
and 
entangled 
quantum 
information of Hawking radiation is considered. In 
the context of the entropy of black holes and 
from a semi-classical approach. 
  
2.2 Entanglement 
 
Now, let's look to entropy and entanglement. 
Indeed, entropy is viewed as a measure of 
entanglement. Entropy provides one tool that can 
be used to quantify entanglement. If the overall 
system is pure, the entropy of one subsystem 
can be used to measure its degree of 
entanglement with the other subsystems. 
 
It is a classical result that the Shannon entropy 
achieves its maximum at, and only at, the 
uniform probability distribution {1/n, ...,1/n}. 
Therefore, a bipartite pure state ρ ∈ HA ⊗ HB is 
said to be a maximally entangled state if the 
reduced state of each subsystem of ρ is the 
diagonal matrix. 
 
 
 
We must note that for mixed states, the reduced 
von Neumann entropy is not the only reasonable 
entanglement measure. 
 
2.3 Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy  
 
The Bekenstein–Hawking area law claims that 
the area of the black hole horizon is proportional 
to the black hole's entropy. 
 
        
     
           
              
The black-hole entropy is proportional to the area 
of its event horizon A. This area relationship was 
generalized to arbitrary regions via the Ryu–
Takayanagi 
formula, 
which 
relates 
the 
entanglement entropy of a boundary conformal 
field theory to a specific surface in its dual 
gravitational theory [19]. 
 
The Bekenstein Hawking entropy formula, since 
it increases under time evolution, should be 
viewed as the coarse-grained entropy formula for 
the black hole [17]. 
 
The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy is a statement 
about the gravitational entropy of a system. 
 
The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy is a measure 
of the information lost to external observers due 
to the presence of the horizon. 
 
2.4 Mass of Bit of Information  
 
About the hidden thermodynamics of isolated 
particles, it is an attempt to bring together the 
three furthest principles of physics: the principles 
of Fermat, Maupertuis, and Carnot, that De 
Broglie has had his final idea. Entropy becomes 
a sort of opposite to action with an equation that 
relates the only two universal dimensions of the 
form: [4] 
 
      
 
=
        
 
 
 
With action = E·time 
And with entropy = k ln(w) 
 
ln(W)= 
      
 
=
    
  
 
In [4], the First equivalence from Entropic 
Information, we have: 
 
ln(W)= 
      
 
=
    
  
 
we replace m by the mass of bit information 
given as 
 
                
  
 
 
where k = 1.38064 ×10-23 J/K is the Boltzmann 
constant 
T is temperature at which the bit of information is 
stored. 
t = time required to change the physical state of 
the information bit 
we have:  
 

 
 
 
 
Denis; PSIJ, 26(4): 1-16, 2022; Article no.PSIJ.90251 
 
 
 
5 
 
ln(W)=
            
  
 
 
 
We have by c² simplification: 
 
Ln(W)=
          
 
 
 
We obtain finally: 
 
ln(W)=
      
 
=
    
 
 
          
 
  
 
mathematical proof given by Landauer principle 
as seen in [4] 
 
    
 
           
 
 
 
We arrive by h and t simplification to: 
 
k T ln(2) =mc² 
 
There is a minimum possible amount of energy 
required to erase one bit of information, that is 
that Landauer's principle asserts and it’s known 
as the Landauer limit. 
 
2.5 Mass of bit of information at Hawking 
Temperature 
 
Now, as seen in [3], at the black hole 
thermodynamics level, we insert into 
          
 
 the 
Hawking Temperature, in relation to the storage 
of mass of bit of information; so, it is represented 
at Hawking Temperature in the frame of the 
Hawking radiation. 
 
Ln(w) = 
          
 
 
 
With T = Hawking Temperature:  
 
   
   
      
 
 =Boltzmann constant, c=speed of light,   = 
Reduced Planck's constant, G=Gravitational 
Constant, M= mass of the black hole, by 
replacing            
 
          
       
 
 
 
By simplification of k, h, we obtain: 
 
Ln(W)= 
        
       
 
With ln(W)= 
      
 
=
    
 
 
          
 
, in the frame of 
Black hole evaporating by Hawking radiation at 
the Hawking temperature with a time required to 
change the physical state of all the bit of 
information of the system equal to the time 
required by the black hole to evaporate                 
(      . 
 
ln(W)=
            
      
 
 
We clearly see the relation between the degree 
of freedom and the process of evaporation of the 
black hole. 
 
Where       = 
        
          
 
2.6 The black holes entropic information 
formula and coarse-grained entropy 
 
We can see the black holes entropic information 
formula as new formulation of Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy which is on the edge of 
thermodynamics, relativity, quantum, gravitation, 
but moreover, this new formulation takes in 
account the information theory. 
 
See Fig.1 
 
2.7 The Black holes entropic information 
formula and Bekenstein bound 
 
The black holes entropic information formula 
given as follows: 
 
S= k ln(W) = 
              
      
 
 
The universal bound originally founded by Jacob 
Bekenstein in 1981 as the inequality [20,21]. 
 
S ≤

(     ) as new formulation of The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy additionally including the 
information notion; where  =Boltzmann constant, c=speed of light,   = Reduced Planck's 
constant, G=Gravitational Constant, M= mass of the black hole and A is the two-dimensional 
area of the black hole’s event horizon,    is the Planck length 
 
As seen in [3], in informational terms, the relation 
between thermodynamic entropy S and Shannon 
entropy H is given by relation between S & H 
 
S= k H ln (2) 
 
Whence, 
 
H =
    
        
 
where H is the Shannon entropy expressed in 
number of bits contained in the quantum states in 
the sphere. The ln 2 factor comes from defining 
the information as the logarithm to the base 2 of 
the number of quantum states 
 
       
            
         
 
So, following S= k H ln(2) 
 
                     
                  
   
where S is the entropy, k is Boltzmann's 
constant, R is the radius of a sphere that can 
enclose the given system, E is the total mass–
energy including any rest masses, ħ is the 
reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of 
light.  
 
As a side note, it can also be shown that                      
the Boltzmann entropy is an upper bound to the 
entropy that a system can have for a fixed 
number of microstates meaning:  
 
S ≤ k lnW 
 
With W reflecting the degree of freedom of a 
system as seen upper. 
 
We have showed from [3] that the black holes 
entropic information formula   
                
      
 is 
equal to the universal bound, 
     
   and that it is 
in relation with degree of freedom of black                   
hole 
seen 
as 
a 
whole 
quantum                          
system. 
 
In [3], some calculations have been realized 
about 
              
      
 in regard to black hole data 
from along all the black hole size scale taking

information relation as proof of the validity of the 
black hole entropic information.

2.8 Hawking Radiation 
 
Quantum field theory in curved spacetime 
(QFTCS) is an extension of quantum field theory 
from Minkowski spacetime to a general curved 
spacetime. The spacetime is treated by this 
theory as a fixed, classical background, while for 
the matter and energy propagating through that 
spacetime 
this 
theory 
gives 
a 
quantum-
mechanical description.  
 
QFTCS is expected to be a viable approximation 
to the theory of quantum gravity when spacetime 
curvature is not significant on the Planck scale. 
The spacetime in which the fields propagate is 
classical but dynamical. The curvature of the 
spacetime is given by the semiclassical Einstein 
equations. 
 
In QFTCS, a single emission of Hawking 
radiation 
involves 
two 
mutually 
entangled 
particles. The thermal aspect of Hawking 
radiation comes from separating entangled 
outgoing Hawking quanta and interior Hawking 
quanta. A quantum of Hawking radiation is 
emitted by the outgoing particle escaping; the 
black hole swallows the infalling particle. Assume 
that in a finite time in the past a black hole has 
been formed and in the future; will be fully 
evaporated away in some finite time. The black 
hole will only emit a finite amount of information 
encoded within its Hawking radiation. The 
Hawking radiation is to put in relation with the 
(finite) 
entropy 
and 
thus 
the 
(non-zero) 
temperature of the black hole: the Hawking 
temperature. Hence the absence of the Hawking 
radiation 
would 
lead 
to 
violations 
of 
thermodynamical laws.  
 
Hawking radiation occurs in an inertial frame 
where spatial distance doesn’t come into it, and, 
where the horizon of a black hole is compact. 
 
Hawking radiation is thermal radiation following 
Boltzmann distribution. 
 
An observer at infinity will see a thermal bath of 
particles coming from the horizon, even though 
the quantum fields are in the local vacuum state 
near the horizon. 
 
2.9 Black Hole System 
 
Throw in a black hole a quantum system in a 
pure state and waits for some amount of time 
until the hole has evaporated, we end up with is 
a thermal state. A pure quantum state is a state 
which can be described by a single ket vector 
and of which the entropy is zero because there is 
no uncertainty in this state. A thermal state is a 
mixed state (described quantum mechanically by 
a density matrix rather than a wave function). So, 
we are face to a system which converts a pure 
state 
into 
a 
mixed 
state. 
During 
the 
transformation between a mixed state and a pure 
state, some information is lost. But prime 
directive of quantum mechanics indicate that 
quantum evolution should be unitary and, thus, 
information and entropy should be conserved. 
 
In fact, if we had a very complex quantum 
system which starts in a pure state, it will appear 
to thermalize and will emit radiation that is very 
close to thermal. In particular, in the early stages, 
if we computed the von Neumann entropy of the 
emitted radiation it would be almost exactly 
thermal because the radiation is entangled with 
the quantum system [17]. 
 
As a side note, we must take in account that the 
black 
Hole 
information 
paradox 
can 
be 
established using the standard Copenhagen 
method of keeping the system separate from the 
measuring device. The black hole information 
paradox 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
quantum 
measurement problem. As such we can discuss 
the solutions to the information paradox without 
committing to any particular interpretation of 
quantum mechanics. 
 
2.10 Casini and the Bekenstein Bound 
Proof  
 
Casini proves the thermodynamics interpretation 
in the form of Bekenstein bound as valid. Indeed, 
we know following the work of Casini in 2008 [18] 
about the Von Neumann entropy and the 
Bekenstein bound, that the proof of the 
Bekenstein bound is valid using quantum field 
theory [22-30]. 
 
For example, given a spatial region V, Casini 
defines the entropy on the left-hand side of the 
Bekenstein bound as: 
 
SV = S (ρ ) − S (ρ 
  ) = − t r ( ρ  log ρ  ) + t r 
( ρ 
  log ρ 
 ) 
 
Casini defines the right-hand side of the 
Bekenstein bound as the difference between the 
expectation value of the modular Hamiltonian in 
the excited state and the vacuum state, 
KV = tr (K ρ ) − tr (K ρ 
 )

11 
 
 
With these definitions, the bound reads SV ≤ KV, 
which can be rearranged to give: 
 
tr (ρ  log ρ ) − tr (ρ  log ρ 
 ) ≥ 0. 
 
This is simply the statement of positivity of 
quantum relative entropy, which proves the 
Bekenstein bound. 
 
2.11 The 
Black 
Holes 
Entropic 
Information 
Formula 
and 
Gravitational Fine-grained Entropy 
 
“However, as the black hole evaporates more 
and more, its area will shrink, and we run into 
trouble when the entropy of radiation is bigger 
than the thermodynamic entropy of the black 
hole. The reason is that now it is not possible               
for the entropy of radiation to be entangled                 
with the quantum system describing the black 
hole because the number of degrees of                
freedom of the black hole is given by its 
thermodynamic entropy, the area of the horizon. 
[17] 
 
This assumption is wrong because it neglects the 
fact that black holes entropic information formula 
is able to express the entropy of the entangled 
radiation based on the degrees of freedom of the 
black hole given by this formula:  
             
      
 
where       = 
        
          independently of the area 
law, which is based on the area of the    horizon. 
 
Diving into Casini’s work with the black holes 
entropic information formula, we obtain new 
enlightening about the gravitational fine grained 
black hole entropy. The ingenious proposal of 
casini [31] is to replace 2 π R E, by: 
 
KV = tr (K ρ ) − tr (K ρ 
 ). 
 
Indeed, in [22-30], Casini’s work, on the right-
hand side of the Bekenstein bound, a difficult 
point is to give a rigorous interpretation of the 
quantity 2 π R E, where R is a characteristic 
length scale of the system and E is a 
characteristic energy. This product has the same 
units as the generator of a Lorentz boost, and the 
natural analog of a boost in this situation is the 
modular Hamiltonian of the vacuum state K = − 
log  ρ 
 ). 
 
With these definitions, the bound reads 
 
SV ≤ KV, 
The version of the Bekenstein bound is SV ≤ KV, 
namely  
 
S(ρ ) − S(ρ 
  ) ≤ Tr(K ρ ) − Tr(K ρ 
 )  
 
is equivalent to 
 
SV ≡ S(ρ  |ρ 
  ) ≡ Tr (ρ  (log ρ  − log ρ 
 )) ≥ 0 
 
Where the black holes entropic information 
formula is equal to Sv where S (ρ   is the Von 
Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix 
ρ  associated with V, V in the excited state ρ, 
and S (ρ 
 ) is the corresponding Von Neumann 
entropy for the vacuum state ρ . 
 
SV ≡ S (ρ |ρ 
 ) ≡ S(ρ ) − S(ρ 
 ) ≡ Tr (ρ  (log 
ρ  − log ρ 
 )) ≡  
               
      
 ≥ 0 
 
As black holes entropic information formula, is 
equal to Bekenstein universal bound  
 
             
      
      
  
 
 
As the difference between the expectation value 
of the modular Hamiltonian in the excited state 
and the vacuum state 
 
KV = tr (K ρ ) − tr (K ρ 
 ). 
 
is equal to Bekenstein universal bound. 
  
Finally, we obtain : 
 
 
KV = tr (K   ) − tr (K   
 ) = 
             
      
    
    ρ  ρ 
      ρ      ρ 
        ρ       ρ   
     ρ 
    =
     
   
 
 
Naive definitions of entropy and energy density in 
Quantum Field Theory suffer from ultraviolet 
divergences. In the case of the Bekenstein 
bound, ultraviolet divergences can be avoided by 
taking differences between quantities computed 
in an excited state and the same quantities 
computed in the vacuum state [32]. 
 
 
We must take note that the first version of the 
fine-grained entropy formula discovered by Ryu 
and Takayanagi is a general formula for the fine-

grained entropy of quantum systems coupled to 
gravity [17]. 
 
The black holes entropic Information formula can 
calculate the entangled Hawking radiation down 
to the quantum system, describing black hole 
independently of the area law of the entropy of 
Bekenstein-Hawking. The black holes entropic 
information formula is equal to the universal 
bound originally found by Jacob Bekenstein 
[20,21]. Which is equal by Casini’s work [18] to 
the difference between the expectation value of 
the modular Hamiltonian in the excited state and 
the vacuum state, itself equal to the Von 
Neumann entropy. The ultraviolet divergences 
can be avoided by taking differences between 
quantities computed in an excited state and the 
same quantities computed in the vacuum state; 
this must be put in relation to Ryu and 
Takayanagi conjecture, a general formula for the 
fine-grained 
entropy 
of 
quantum 
systems 
coupled to gravity [17]. 
 
2.12 Ryu and Takayanagi Conjecture 
 
The Ryu–Takayanagi conjecture is a conjecture 
within holography that posits a quantitative 
relationship between the entanglement entropy 
of a conformal field theory and the geometry of 
an associated anti-de Sitter spacetime [33,34]. 
The formula characterizes "holographic screens" 
in the bulk; that is, it specifies which regions of 
the bulk geometry are "responsible to particular 
information in the dual CFT" [35]. 
 
The Ryu–Takayanagi formula calculates the 
entropy of quantum entanglement in conformal 
field theories on Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of 
black holes in the context of Juan Martín 
Maldacena's holographic principle, in which 
conformal field theories on a surface form a 
gravitational theory in a closed volume [36]. 
 
“The 
Bekenstein–Hawking 
area 
law, 
while 
claiming that the area of the black hole horizon is 
proportional to the black hole's entropy, fails to 
provide a sufficient microscopic description of 
how this entropy arises. The holographic 
principle provides such a description by relating 
the black hole system to a quantum system 
which 
does 
admit 
such 
a 
microscopic 
description. In this case, the CFT has discrete 
eigenstates, and the thermal state is the 
canonical ensemble of these states [19]. The 
entropy of this ensemble can be calculated 
through normal means, and yields the same 
result as predicted by the area law. This turns out 
to be a special case of the Ryu–Takayanagi 
conjecture” [16]. 
 
“The first version of the fine-grained entropy 
formula was discovered by Ryu and Takayanagi 
[37]. It was subsequently refined and generalized 
by several authors [38-45]. Originally, the Ryu-
Takayanagi formula was proposed to calculate 
holographic entanglement entropy in anti-de 
Sitter spacetime, but the present understanding 
of the formula is much more general. It requires 
neither holography, nor entanglement, nor anti-
de Sitter spacetime. Rather it is a general 
formula for the fine-grained entropy of quantum 
systems coupled to gravity” [17]. 
 
The black-hole entropy is proportional to the area 
of its event horizon A. The black hole entropy 
horizon law which turns out to be a special case 
of the Ryu–Takayanagi conjecture. The black-
hole entropy area relationship was generalized to 
arbitrary 
regions 
via 
the 
Ryu–Takayanagi 
formula, which relates the entanglement entropy 
of a boundary conformal field theory to a specific 
surface in its dual gravitational theory [19] but the 
current understanding of the formula is much 
more general. As being a general formula for the 
fine-grained 
entropy 
of 
quantum 
systems 
coupled to gravity [17]. 
 
3. RESULTS, DISCUSSION, 
GENERALIZATION 
 
During the exploration of the black holes scale, 
following our results, we have found that the 
black holes entropic information formula for a 
mass of bit of information at the Hawking 
temperature is equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking 
entropy of the black hole, result materialized by 
the rapport of both formulas. We have taken 
extremal data from the black holes scale analysis 
with the two most extreme value (GW170817, 
TON618) giving the value of the rapport of both 
formulae matching perfectly, indeed the result is 
one, the perfect egality. For the two other data 
used (Cygnus X1, Messsier87) we obtain a 
maximum difference of         in regard to the 
rapport of both formulas. We have use two 
different relations for the black holes entropic 
information formula. One is to put in relation to 
the Planck area relation formula showed at Fig. 6 
and the other is to put in relation to the 
informational expression seen in Fig. 7. We have 
new formulation of the Bekenstein-Hawking 
entropy additionally including the information 
notion and the time of evaporation of the

considered black hole. Moreover, as showed in 
[3], that in the framework of black hole, the black 
holes entropic Information formula for a mass of 
bit of information at the Hawking temperature is 
equal to the universal bound originally found by 
Jacob Bekenstein:  
              
      
  
     
  
 because 
black hole saturates exactly the bound. First the 
work of Casini [22-30] between entropy of Von 
Neumann and of Bekenstein and the proof of the 
validity of this one in the quantum field theory 
framework. 
Second, 
with 
the 
equivalence 
between the black hole entropic information 
formula and the Von Neumann entropy, made 
possible by an ingenious proposal of Casini to 
equal the difference between the expectation 
value of the modular Hamiltonian in the excited 
state and the vacuum state, KV = tr (K ρ ) − tr (K 
ρ 
 ) to 2 π R E [22]. As black holes entropic 
information formula is equal to the universal 
bound, this leads to 
new formulation of 
gravitational 
fine-grained 
entropy 
regarding 
entropic information theory. The black holes 
entropic information formula can calculate the 
entropy of the black hole regardless of the area 
of the horizon and avoiding the ultraviolet 
divergences. The ultraviolet divergences can be 
avoided by taking differences between quantities 
computed in an excited state and the same 
quantities computed in the vacuum state. The 
black 
holes 
entropic 
information 
formula 
expresses the gravitational fine grained black 
hole entropy by a semiclassical gravity approach. 
Indeed, in a semiclassical gravity view, matter is 
represented by quantum matter fields that 
propagate according to QFTCS. We have 
calculated the Von Neumann entropy, the 
gravitational fine-grained entropy of the black 
hole independently of the area of the horizon law. 
The black holes entropic information formula 
expresses the black hole gravitational fine-
grained entropy down to the quantum level 
independently 
of 
the 
area 
horizon’s 
law 
permitting to the entropy of Hawking radiation to 
be entangled with the initial considered black 
hole seen as a whole quantum system. The 
black holes entropic information formula must be 
put in relation to Ryu–Takayanagi formula being 
a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of 
quantum systems coupled to gravity [17]. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
The black holes entropic information formula 
solves the problem of the black hole information 
paradox by explaining the information processes 
involved in entropy for black holes down to the 
quantum 
level 
independently 
of 
the 
area 
horizon’s 
law 
by 
providing 
a 
sufficient 
microscopic description of how this entropy 
arises. The black holes entropic information 
formula shows that the process of black holes 
evaporation is consistent with the unitarity 
principle. Indeed, the black holes entropic 
information 
formula 
calculate 
the 
Hawking 
radiation encoding the entangled 
quantum 
information of the initial considered black hole. 
We have showed in [3]; that in the framework of 
black hole, the entropic Information formula 
taking in account the mass of bit of information at 
the Hawking temperature is equal to the 
universal bound originally found by Jacob 
Bekenstein:   
             
      
  
     
  
 because black 
hole saturates exactly the bound. The fact is that 
the black-hole entropy is also the maximal 
entropy that can be obtained by the Bekenstein 
bound, wherein, the Bekenstein bound becomes 
an equality. Moreover, the equality between 
black holes entropic information formula and the 
Von Neumann entropy, made possible by an 
ingenious proposal of Casini [22-30] to equal the 
difference between the expectation value of the 
modular Hamiltonian in the excited state and the 
vacuum state, KV = tr (K ρ ) − tr (K ρ 
 ) to 2 π R 
E [22], as the black holes entropic information 
formula is also equal to the universal bound. This 
leads to formulation of gravitational fine-grained 
entropy in regard to the entropic information 
theory. Until now, it was not possible to express 
the gravitational fine-grain entropy of a black hole 
using the rules of gravity [46]. However, the black 
holes entropic information formula can calculate 
the entropy of the black hole independently of the 
area horizon’s law and avoiding the ultraviolet 
divergences. Indeed, the ultraviolet divergences 
can be avoided by taking differences between 
quantities computed in an excited state and the 
same quantities computed in the vacuum state. 
The black holes entropic information formula 
expresses the gravitational fine grained black 
hole entropy by a semiclassical gravity approach. 
The black holes entropic information formula as 
new formulation of Bekenstein–Hawking entropy 
additionally including the information notion and 
the time of evaporation of the considered black 
hole permits to express the black hole entropy 
down to the quantum level independently of the 
area horizon’s law permitting to the entropy of 
Hawking radiation to be entangled with the initial 
considered black hole seen as a whole quantum 
system. The black holes entropy which turns out 
to be a special case of the Ryu–Takayanagi 
conjecture” [16]. Ryu–Takayanagi formula being

a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of 
quantum systems coupled to gravity [17]. That 
put the accent on the emergence quantum 
gravity process through the fundamentality of the 
entangled 
quantum 
information. 
All 
those 
informational 
processes 
lead 
to 
news 
perspectives in the approach of theoretical 
physics where we can see entangled quantum 
information as the building block of the universe, 
responsible of the emergent gravity, and being a 
keystone 
in 
the 
quantum 
entanglement 
processes, where entanglement doesn’t create 
entropy, but it is entropy, in the sense of 
information. 
Moreover, 
we 
can 
see 
the 
implication of the concept of information in the 
measurement problem indeed the collapse of the 
wave function is due to the fact that when a 
measure is taken, this is taking information out…. 
measurer absorbs information about system so 
modify the system, the wave function is 
collapsing because information is absorbed. We 
can envisage information as existing by itself as 
information is code, and code is what is create 
the process but is itself the process. We can 
even envisage some more deep implications as: 
“No bits, no structure, no existence”. “If 
consciousness 
exists 
before 
information, 
consciousness has nothing to know, indeed no 
consciousness without information”. “You must 
know that universe doesn’t need you to exist”.

maintaining 
that 
Bekenstein's 
original 
formulation of the bound is the correct 
form. See in particular the paragraph 
beginning with "A few points ..." on p (or p. 
9 of the arXiv version), and the discussions 
on the Bekenstein bound that follow 
throughout the paper.
