Jablonski Diagram
A Jablonski diagram is a simple schematic portrayal of the relative en-
ergies of the electronic states of molecules and atoms and the vibrational
levels of molecules (Figure J.1). Each stack of levels is portrayed as a
ladder but the relative horizontal positions of the stacks bear no relation
to the actual location of the molecular potential energy curve.
jj-Coupling
In a jj-coupling scheme, first the spin and orbital angular momenta of
each electron are coupled, using the Clebsch–Gordan series
j ¼ l þ s; l þ s  1; . . .; jl  sj

Then the total angular momentum of each electron is coupled into an
overall coupled angular momentum by using the series again in the
form
J ¼ j1 þ j2; j1 þ j2  1; . . .; j j1  j2j
See Figure J.2. It is most relevant to atoms in which the spin–orbit
coupling of an atom is so strong that Russell–Saunders coupling is
inappropriate, which is for atoms of high atomic number.
Joule–Thomson Eﬀect
The Joule–Thomson eﬀect is the change in temperature that occurs
when a gas expands isenthalpically as it passes through a throttle from
high to low pressure (Figure J.3). The isenthalpic (constant enthalpy)
character of the expansion is ensured by arranging for it to be adiabatic.
The magnitude of the eﬀect is expressed by the Joule–Thomson
coeﬃcient, m, which is defined as
m ¼

H
The temperature falls on expansion if m40 and rises if mo0. The
change in the sign of m occurs at the inversion temperature of the gas.
The Joule–Thomson coeﬃcient is measured indirectly by deter-
mining the isothermal Joule–Thomson coeﬃcient, mT, where
mT ¼

The two coeﬃcients are related by
mCp ¼  mT
For a perfect gas m ¼ 0 and mT ¼ 0. For a real gas m and mT are nonzero
even as p-0 and the limiting value of mT can be expressed in terms of
the second virial coeﬃcient, B, as
mT ! B  T dB
