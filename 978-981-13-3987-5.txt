Foreword 1. About This Book
En effet, Barbaresco m’a dit qu’il était curieux de voir le texte qui a été publié
d’après un cours sur la géométrie symplectique que j’ai donné à Tianjin, il y a bien
longtemps. Je n’ai rien pu lui procurer d’autre que le petit fascicule rédigé en
chinois par un assistant de Nankai. Je ne sais pas ce qu’il vaut. De toutes façons, il
n’y avait pas beaucoup de choses originales dans ce que j’ai raconté.
Indeed, Barbaresco told me that he was curious to see the text that was published
according to a course on symplectic geometry that I gave in Tianjin, long time ago.
I could not give anything else but the little notebook written in Chinese by a Nankai
assistant. I do not know whether it was worthful. In any case, there were no too
many original things in what I was speaking about.
J.-L. Koszul, 02/02/2017.
Above is an excerpt from a message sent to me by Jean-Louis Koszul in
February 2017. Earlier, in January 2017, I had written to Koszul about the lectures
on Symplectic Geometry he delivered in China. I informed him that the notes of
those lectures were missing in my private documentation. I also informed him that
Fréderic Barbaresco was interested in these notes.
This book is more than an elementary introduction to symplectic structures and
their geometry. It highlights the unifying nature of symplectic structures. Often,
readings of Koszul works are walks through Algebra, Homological Algebra,
Geometry, Differential Geometry, Topology, and Differential Topology. This adage
is highlighted by Foreword 3. The lectures in this book were delivered while new
developments in Symplectic Geometry were occurring, with the works of
A. Weinstein, B. Kostant, V. Guillemin, S. Stenberg, M. Atiyah, R. Bott, and many
others. Koszul also emphasizes fruitful exchanges of results and techniques
between Symplectic Geometry and other areas. For example, in Chap. 4, the notion
of momentum map leads to rich relationships between symplectic structures,
homological algebra, afﬁne representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras, and
homogeneous spaces. The author introduces many additional structures in mani-
folds endowed with symplectic structures. Major instances are Lagrangian
v

submanifolds, complex symplectic structures, and Kaehler forms. Symplectic
structures appear as a unifying framework for several notions worth studying.
Koszul’s Geometry and its applications to bounded domains strongly impact many
areas which are currently the subject of active and exciting research, such as the
Geometric Science of Information and the Topology of Information. According to
the Stefan–Sussmann theorem, Poisson geometry is the Differential Topological
side of symplectic geometry, while Lagrangian foliations are the differential
topological side of locally ﬂat geometry. The starting point of this book is the
algebraic counterpart of those subjects. One could claim that quantum data are those
data which are Z2-graded. Under such a simpliﬁcation, Chap. 6 is an introduction to
quantum symplectic structures. I have often talked with Koszul about his stays in
China and in India. He and the editors had planned to include a video with this
book. However, on November 28, 2017, Koszul wrote to me :
Depuis que nous sommes installés dans cette maison de retraite, je suis très mal
en point et très affaibli. Dans l’état où je suis, il n’est évidemment pas question que
je donne un interview, je regrette bien de vous décevoir.
J.-L. Koszul, 28/11/2017.
Since we have settled in this retirement house, I feel very badly and very
weakened. In the situation that I am now, there is obviously no question that I give
an interview, I regret to disappoint you.
What is new? As I just mentioned, some of Koszul’s work deeply impacts
current research in both the Topology of Information and the Geometric Science of
Information as well as their applications in Physics. This relates to his work on the
geometry of convex cones, on the afﬁne representations of Lie groups and Lie
algebras, and on deformations of locally ﬂat manifolds. Koszul knew of the con-
nection through Barbaresco’s paper Koszul information geometry and Souriau Lie
group thermodynamics. He wrote to me :
Pour ce qui est des représentations afﬁnes, je ne suis pas le premier à les avoir
manipulé. Si j’ai bon souvenir, elles interviennent dans le travail des russes sur les
domaines bornés. A part cela, cet article de Barbaresco contient bien de choses que
j’aimerais comprendre. Je vais essayer de m’y mettre.
As for the afﬁne representations, I am not the ﬁrst to have manipulated them. If I
remember correctly, they intervene in the work of the Russians on the bounded
domains. Apart from that, this Barbaresco article contains many things that I would
like to understand. I will try myself to enter into the matter of the article.
J.-L. Koszul.
Thence, I undertook to convince him that the mathematical foundation of the
Geometric Science of Information is the algebraic topology of Koszul Geometry,
viz the cohomology theory of Koszul Geometry. Subsequently, Koszul’s interest in
the Geometric Science of Information increased.

Je suis sensible à l’honneur que me fait le comité d’organisation du congrès
2013 en m’invitant à la conférence de Shima et je vous demande de bien vouloir lui
transmettre mes remerciements. J’aimerais aussi pouvoir vous dire de transmettre
mon acception.
I am sensible to the honor that the organizing committee of the 2013 congress
gave me inviting me to the Shima conference and I ask you to forward kindly my
thanks. I would also like to tell you to convey my gratitude.
J.-L. Koszul, 20/12/2012.
On August 29, 2013, H. Shima delivered a keynote conference on Hessian
Geometry, whose founder is Jean-Louis Koszul.
Je ne regrette pas d’avoir été à Paris le 29 Août, en plus de ces retrouvailles
avec Shima, j’ai observé avec intérêt ce colloque GSI dont le contenu et les
objectifs étaient pour moi assez mystérieux. J’ai aussi regardé avec curiosité le
volume de Lectures Notes publié à l’occasion de cette rencontre et cela m’a bien
aidé à comprendre ce que l’on visait. A propos de ce volume, réussir à le sortir
dans les délais est une prouesse que j’admire beaucoup. Je crois bien n’avoir
jamais vu cela. Encore une fois, merci de m’avoir signalé cette rencontre et de
m’avoir encouragé à faire le déplacement.
I do not regret having been in Paris on August 29, in addition to this reunion of
Shima, I watched with interest this GSI conference whose content and objectives
were rather mysterious for me. I also looked with curiosity at the volume of Lecture
Notes published on the occasion of this meeting and it helped me to understand
what we sought. Concerning this volume, succeeding to release on time is a feat
that I admire a lot. I think I have never seen things like that. Once again, thank you
for informing me about this meeting and to have encouraged me to make the trip.

Jean-Louis Koszul’s Life: The Spirit of Geometry and the Spirit
of Finesse of an “Esprit rafﬁné”
Jean-Louis André Stanislas Koszul, born in Strasbourg in 1921, was the fourth
child of a family of four (with three older sisters, Marie Andrée, Antoinette, and
Jeanne) of André Koszul (born in Roubaix on November 19, 1878, Professor at
Strasbourg University), and Marie Fontaine (born in Lyon on June 19, 1887), who
was a friend of Henri Cartan’s mother. Henri Cartan writes on this friendship “My
mother, in her youth, had been a close friend of the one who was to become
Jean-Louis Koszul’s mother” [4]. His paternal grandparents were Julien Stanislas
Koszul and Hélène Ludivine Rosalie Marie Salomé. He attended high school in
Fustel-de-Coulanges in Strasbourg and the Faculty of Science in Strasbourg and in
Paris. He entered ENS Ulm in the class of 1940 and defended his thesis with Henri
Cartan. Henri Cartan noted “This promotion included other mathematicians like
Belgodère and Godement, and also physicists and some chemists, like Marc Julia
and Raimond Castaing” [4] (Fig. 1).
On July 17, 1948, Jean-Louis Koszul married Denise Reyss-Brion, who became
a student at ENS Sèvre, in 1941. They had three children, Michel (married to
Christine Duchemin), Anne (wife of Stanislas Crouzier), and Bertrand. Koszul then
taught in Strasbourg and was appointed as Associate Professor at the University of
Strasbourg in 1949, and his colleagues including René Thom, Marcel Berger, and
Bernard Malgrange. He was promoted to Professor in 1956 and became a member
of second generation of Bourbaki, with Jacques Dixmier, Roger Godement, Samuel
ix

Eilenberg, Pierre Samuel, Jean-Pierre Serre, and Laurent Schwartz. Henri Cartan
remarked in [4] “In the vehement discussions within Bourbaki, Koszul was not one
of those who spoke loudly; but we learned to listen to him because we knew that if
he opened his mouth he had something to say” (Fig. 2).
About Koszul’s period at Strasbourg University, Pierre Cartier [43] said “When I
arrived in Strasbourg, Koszul was returning from a year spent at the Institute for

Advanced Studies in Princeton, and he was, after the departure of Ehresman and
Lichnerowicz to Paris, the paternal ﬁgure of the Department of Mathematics
(despite his young age). I am not sure of his intimate convictions, but he repre-
sented for me a typical ﬁgure of this Alsatian Protestantism, which I frequented at
the time. He shared the seriousness, the honesty, the common sense and the bal-
ance. In particular, he knew how to resist the academic attraction of Paris. He left
us after two years to go to Grenoble, in a maneuver uncommon at the time,
exchanging of positions with Georges Reeb.” In Strasbourg, he supervised Edith
Kosmanek Ph.D. [44], a graduate from Louis Pasteur University (Fig. 3).
Koszul became Senior Lecturer at the University of Grenoble in 1963, and then
an Honorary Professor at Joseph Fourier University [6] and integrated into the
Fourier Institute led by Claude Chabauty. During this period, as recalled by Bernard
Malgrange [42], Koszul held a seminar on “algebra and geometry” with his three
students Jacques Vey [45–46], Domingo Dominique Luna [47], and Jacques
Helmstetter [48–50]. In Grenoble, Koszul practiced mountaineering and was a
member of the French Alpine Club. He was awarded the Jaffré Prize in 1975 and
was elected correspondent at the Academy of Sciences on January 28, 1980. The
following year, he was elected to the Academy of São Paulo. Koszul was one of the
CIRM conference center founders at Luminy. Jean-Louis Koszul died on January
12, 2018, at the age of 97.

As early as 1947, Koszul published three articles in the Comptes Rendus of the
Academy of Sciences, on the Betti number of a simple compact Lie group, on
cohomology rings, generalizing ideas of Jean Leray, and ﬁnally on the homology of
homogeneous spaces. Koszul’s thesis, defended on June 10, 1949 under the
direction of Henri Cartan, dealt with the homology and cohomology of Lie alge-
bras. The jury was composed of Professors Arnaud Denjoy (president), Henri
Cartan, Paul Dubreil, and Jean Leray. Under the title “Works of Koszul I, II and III”,
Henri Cartan reported Koszul’s Ph.D. results to the Bourbaki seminar (Fig. 4).

In 1987, an International Symposium on Geometry was held in Grenoble in
honor of Koszul, whose proceedings were published in “les Annales de l’Institut
Fourier”, Volume 37, No. 4. This conference began with a presentation by Henri
Cartan, who remembered the mention given to Koszul for his aggregation [4]:
“Distinguished Spirit; he is successful in his problems. Should beware, orally, of
overly systematic trends. A little less subtle complications, baroque ideas, a little
more common sense and balance would be desirable.” About his supervision of
Koszul’s Ph.D., Henri Cartan wrote “Why did he turn to me as his ‘guide’ (so to
speak)? Is it because he found inspiration in Elie Cartan’s work on the topology of
Lie groups? Perhaps he was surprised to note that mathematical knowledge is not
necessarily transmitted by descent. In any case, he helped me to better know what
my father had brought to the theory” [4]. On the work of Koszul algebraic work,
Henri Cartan notes “Koszul was the ﬁrst to give a precise algebraic formalization
of the situation studied by Leray in his 1946 publication, which became the theory
of spectral sequences. It took a good deal of insight to unravel what lay behind
Leray’s study. In this respect, Koszul’s Note in the July 1947 CRAS is of historical
signiﬁcance” [4]. From June 26 to July 2, 1947, CNRS hosted an International
conference in Paris, on “Algebraic Topology”. This was the ﬁrst postwar interna-
tional diffusion of Leray’s ideas. Koszul writes about this lecture “I can still see
Leray putting down his chalk at the end of his talk by saying (modestly?) that he
deﬁnitely did not understand anything about Algebraic Topology.” In writing his
lectures at the Collège de France, Leray adopted the algebraic presentation of the
spectral sequence elaborated by Koszul. As early as 1950, Jean-Pierre Serre used
the term “Leray–Koszul sequence”. Speaking of Leray, Koszul wrote “around
1955, I remember asking him what had put him on the path of what he called the
homology ring of a representation in his Notes to the CRAS of 1946. His answer
was Künneth’s theorem; I could not ﬁnd out more.” Sheaf theory, introduced by
Jean Leray, followed in 1947, at the same time as spectral sequences.
In 1950, Koszul published an important 62-page book entitled Homology and
Cohomology of Lie Algebras in which he studied the links between the homology
and cohomology (with real coefﬁcients) of a compact connected Lie group and
purely algebraic problems of Lie algebra. Koszul then gave a lecture in São Paulo
on the topic “sheaves and cohomology”. The superb lecture notes were published in
1957 and dealt with Čech cohomology with coefﬁcients in a sheaf. In the autumn of
1958, he organized a second series of seminars in São Paulo, on symmetric spaces [8].
R. Bott commented on these seminars “very pleasant. The pace is fast, and the con-
siderable material is covered elegantly. In addition to the more or less standard
theorems on symmetric spaces, the author discusses the geometry of geodesics,
Bergmann’s metrics, and ﬁnally studies the bounded domains with many details.” In
the mid-1960s, Koszul taught at the Tata Institute in Bombay on transformation groups
[12] and on ﬁber bundles and differential geometry. The second lecture dealt with the
theory of connections and the lecture notes were published in 1965.

In 1994, in [3], a comment by Koszul explains the problems he was preoccupied
with when he invented what is now called the “Koszul complex”. This was intro-
duced to deﬁne a cohomology theory for Lie algebras and proved to be useful in
general homological algebra.

The Genesis of this Translation of Koszul’s Book “Introduction
to Symplectic Geometry”
The genesis of the translation of this book dates back to 2013. We got in contact
with Professor Koszul in connection with his work on homogeneous bounded
domains and their links with Information Geometry. Professor Michel Boyom
successfully convinced Professor Koszul to accept our invitation to attend the ﬁrst
GSI “Geometric Science of Information” conference in August 2013 at Ecole des
Mines ParisTech in Paris, and more especially to attend Hirohiko Shima talk, given
in his honor, on the topic “Geometry of Hessian Structures” (Fig. 7).
We were more particularly motivated by Koszul’s work developed in his paper
Domaines bornées homogènes et orbites de groupes de transformations afﬁnes
[9] of 1961, written by Koszul at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton
during a stay funded by the National Science Foundation. Koszul proved in this
paper that on a complex homogeneous space, an invariant volume deﬁnes with the
complex structure the canonical invariant Hermitian form introduced in [7]. It is in
this article that Koszul uses the afﬁne representation of Lie groups and Lie
algebras. By studying the open orbits of the afﬁne representations, he introduced an
afﬁne representation of G, written f; q
ð
Þ, and the following equation setting f of the

linear representation of the Lie algebra g of G, deﬁned by f, and q the restriction to
g of the differential of q (f and q are, respectively, differential of f and q):
f ðXÞqðYÞ  f ðYÞqðXÞ ¼ q X; Y
½

Þ 8X; Y 2 g
with f : g ! glðEÞ and q : g 7! E
ð1Þ
If the homogeneous space is holomorphically isomorphic to a bounded domain
of a space Cn, this Hermitian form is positive deﬁnite because it coincides with the
Bergmann metric of the domain. Koszul demonstrates in this article the converse of
this proposition for a class of complex homogeneous spaces. This class consists of
some open orbits of complex afﬁne transformation groups and contains all homo-
geneous bounded domains. Koszul again addresses the problem of knowing if a
complex homogeneous space, with a canonical Hermitian form, that is positive
deﬁnite, is isomorphic to a bounded domain, but via the study of the invariant
bilinear form deﬁned on a real homogeneous space by an invariant volume and an
invariant ﬂat connection. Koszul demonstrates that if this bilinear form is positive
deﬁnite, then the homogeneous space with its ﬂat connection is isomorphic to a
convex open domain containing no straight line in a real vector space and extends it
to the initial problem for the complex homogeneous spaces obtained in deﬁning a
complex structure in the variety of vectors of a real homogeneous space provided
with an invariant ﬂat connection.
Koszul’s use of the afﬁne representation of Lie groups and Lie algebras drew our
attention, especially the similarities of his approach with that used by Jean-Marie
Souriau in geometric mechanics in the framework of homogeneous symplectic
manifolds. We then initiated explorations to make the bridge between Koszul and
Souriau’s works. We ﬁnally discovered that, in 1986, Koszul published this book
“Introduction to symplectic geometry” following a Koszul lectured in English
course in China. We also observed that this book analyzes in detail and develops
Souriau’s works on homogeneous symplectic manifolds in Geometric Mechanics
by the means of the afﬁne representation of Lie algebras and Lie groups. Chuan
Yu Ma writes in a review of this book in Chinese that “This work coincided with
developments in the ﬁeld of analytical mechanics. Many new ideas have also been
derived using a wide variety of notions of modern algebra, differential geometry,
Lie groups, functional analysis, differentiable manifolds, and representation theory.
[Koszul’s book] emphasizes the differential-geometric and topological properties of
symplectic manifolds. It gives a modern treatment of the subject that is useful for
beginners as well as for experts.”
We then started an epistolary correspondence with Professor Koszul on
Souriau’s works and on the genesis of this book. In May 2015, questioning Koszul
on Souriau’s work on Geometric Mechanics and on Lie Group Thermodynamics,
Koszul answered me “[A l’époque où Souriau développait sa théorie, l’establish-
ment avait tendance à ne pas y voir des avancées importantes. Je l’ai entendu
exposer ses idées sur la thermodynamique mais je n’ai pas du tout réalisé à
l’époque que la géométrie hessienne était en jeu.] At the time when Souriau was
xvi
Foreword 2. Koszul Contemporaneous Lecture: Elementary …

developing his theory, the establishment tended not to see signiﬁcant progress.
I heard him explaining his ideas on thermodynamics but I did not realize at the time
that Hessian geometry was at stake.” In September 2016, I asked him about the
origins of Lie Group and Lie Algebra Afﬁne representations. Koszul informed me
about the seminal work of Elie Cartan, who gave him lectures at ENS Ulm on
homogeneous bounded domains, the germinal root of his Ph.D.: “[Il y a là bien des
choses que je voudrais comprendre (trop peut-être !), ne serait-ce que la relation
entre ce que j’ai fait et les travaux de Souriau. Détecter l’origine d’une notion ou la
première apparition d’un résultat est souvent difﬁcile. Je ne suis certainement pas
le premier à avoir utilisé des représentations afﬁnes de groupes ou d’algèbres de
Lie. On peut effectivement imaginer que cela se trouve chez Elie Cartan, mais je ne
puis rien dire de précis. A propos d’Elie Cartan: je n’ai pas été son élève. C’est
Henri Cartan qui a été mon maître pendant mes années de thèse. En 1941 ou 42
j’ai entendu une brève série de conférences données par Elie à l’Ecole Normale et
ce sont des travaux d’Elie qui ont été le point de départ de mon travail de thèse.]
There are many things that I would like to understand (too much perhaps!), if only
the relationship between what I did and the work of Souriau. Detecting the origin of
a notion or the ﬁrst appearance of a result is often difﬁcult. I am certainly not the
ﬁrst to have used afﬁne representations of groups or Lie algebras. We can imagine
that it is Elie Cartan, but I cannot say anything speciﬁc. About Elie Cartan: I was
not his student. It was Henri Cartan who was my master during my thesis years. In
1941 or 42, I heard a brief series of lectures given by Elie at the Ecole Normale and
it was Elie’s work that was the starting point of my thesis work.”
After discovering the existence of Koszul’s book, written in Chinese, based on a
course “Introduction to Symplectic Geometry”, given at Nakai, in which he made
reference to Souriau’s book and developed his main tools, we started to discuss its
content. In January 2017, Koszul wrote me with his usual humility “[Ce petit
fascicule d’introduction à la géométrie symplectique a été rédigé par un assistant
de Nankai qui avait suivi mon cours. Il n’y a pas eu de version initiale en français.]
This small introductory booklet on symplectic geometry was written by a Nankai
assistant who had taken my course. There was no initial version in French.” I asked
him if he had a personal archive of this course. He answered “[Je n’ai pas conservé
de notes préparatoires à ce cours. Dites-moi à quelle adresse je puis vous envoyer
un exemplaire du texte chinois.] I have not kept any preparatory notes for this
course. Tell me where I can send you a copy of the Chinese text.” Professor Koszul
then sent me his last copy of this book in Chinese (Fig. 8).
I was not able to read the Chinese text, but I have observed in Chap. 4
“Symplectic G-spaces”, and in Chap. 5 “Poisson Manifolds”, that their equations
include new original developments of Souriau’s work on moment maps and afﬁne
representation of Lie Groups and Lie Algebra. More particularly, Koszul considered
in great detail “non-equivariance” case of co-adjoint action on moment map,
where I recovered Souriau’s theorem. Koszul shows that when (M; x) is a con-
nected Hamiltonian G-space and l a moment of the action of G, there exists an
afﬁne action of G on g (dual Lie algebra), whose linear part is the coadjoint action,
for which the moment l is equivariant. Koszul developed Souriau’s idea that this
Foreword 2. Koszul Contemporaneous Lecture: Elementary …
xvii

afﬁne action is obtained by modifying the coadjoint action by means of a closed
cochain (called a cocycle by Souriau), and that (M; x) is a G-Poisson space, making
reference to Souriau’s book for more details.
About collaboration between Koszul and Souriau and another potential lecture
on Symplectic Geometry in Toulouse, Koszul informed me in February 2017 that:
“[J’ai plus d’une fois rencontré Souriau lors de colloques, mais nous n’avons
jamais collaboré. Pour ce qui est de cette allusion à un “cours” donné à Toulouse,
il y erreur. J’y ai peut être fait un exposé en 81, mais rien d’autre.] I have met
Souriau more than once at conferences, but we have never collaborated. As for this
allusion to a “course” given in Toulouse, there is an error. I could have made a
presentation in 81, but nothing else.” Koszul admitted that he had no direct col-
laboration with Souriau: “[Je ne crois pas avoir jamais parlé de ses travaux avec
Souriau. Du reste j’avoue ne pas en avoir bien mesuré l’importance à l’époque] I
do not think I ever talked to Souriau about his work. For the rest, I admit that I did
not have a good idea of its importance at the time.”

Considering the importance of this book for different communities, I tried to ﬁnd
an editor for its translation into English. By chance, I met Catriona Byrne from
SPRINGER, when I gave a talk at IHES, invited by Pierre Cartier, on applications
of Koszul and Souriau’s work to Radar (concluded by beautiful pieces of music
written by Julien Koszul, Jean-Louis’ grandfather, performed by Bertrand Maury).
With the perseverance of Michel Boyom, we convinced Professor Koszul to
translate this book, proposing to contextualize it with regard to contemporary
research trends in Geometric Mechanics, Lie Group Thermodynamics, and the
Geometric Science of Information. Professors Marle and Boyom agreed to check
the translation and help me to write the forewords.
Koszul’s Book: A Joint Source of Geometric Heat Theory
and Information Geometry
In the Foreword of this book, Koszul writes “The development of analytical
mechanics provided the basic concepts of symplectic structures. The term sym-
plectic structure is due largely to analytical mechanics. But in this book, the
applications of symplectic structure theory to mechanics is not discussed in any
detail.” Koszul considers purely algebraic and geometric developments of
Geometric/Analytic Mechanics developed during the 60s, in particular, Jean-Marie
Souriau’s works detailed in Chaps. 4 and 5. The originality of this book lies in the
fact that Koszul develops new points of view, and demonstrations not initially
considered by Souriau and later developed by the Geometric Mechanics
community.
Jean-Marie Souriau was the Creator of a new discipline called “Mécanique
Géométrique (Geometric Mechanics)”. Souriau observed that the collection of
motions of a dynamical system is a manifold with an antisymmetric ﬂat tensor that
is a symplectic form where the structure contains all the pertinent information on
the state of the system (positions, velocities, forces, etc.). Souriau said: “[Ce que
Lagrange a vu, que n’a pas vu Laplace, c’était la structure symplectique] What
Lagrange saw, that Laplace didn’t see, was the symplectic structure.” Using the
symmetries of a symplectic manifold, Souriau introduced a mapping which he
called the “moment map”, which takes its values in a space attached to the group of
symmetries (in the dual space of its Lie algebra). The moment map allows one to
build conserved quantities for the group action, generalizing the classical notions of
linear and angular momentum. Souriau associated to this moment maps the notion
of symplectic cohomology, linked to the fact that such a moment is deﬁned up to an
additive constant that brings into play an algebraic mechanism (called cohomol-
ogy). Souriau proved that the moment map is a constant of the motion and pro-
vided a geometric generalization of Emmy Noether’s invariant theorem (invariants
of E. Noether’s theorem are the components of the moment map; but where
Noether’s approach is purely algebraic, Souriau’s approach gives geometric roots

and meanings to these invariants). Souriau has deﬁned in a geometrical way the
Noetherian symmetries using the Lagrange–Souriau 2-form with the moment
map. Inﬂuenced by François Gallissot (Souriau and Galissot both attended ICM’54
in Moscow. Did they discuss this point?), Souriau introduced in Mechanics the
Lagrange 2-form, recovering Lagrange’s seminal ideas. Motivated by the need to
give a coordinate-independent formulation of the variational principles, inspired by
Henri Poincaré and Elie Cartan who introduced a differential 1-form instead of the
Lagrangian, Souriau introduced the Lagrange 2-form as the exterior differential
of the Poincaré–Cartan 1-form, and obtained the phase space as a symplectic
manifold. Souriau proposed to consider this Lagrange 2-form as the fundamental
structure for Lagrangian system and not the classical Lagrangian function or the
Poincaré–Cartan 1-form. This 2-form is called the Lagrange-Souriau 2-form and is
the exterior derivative of the Lepage form (the Poincaré–Cartan form is a ﬁrst-order
Lepage form). This structure is developed in Koszul’s book, where the authors
show that when (M; x) is an exact symplectic manifold (when there exists a 1-form
a on M such that x ¼ da), and that a symplectic action leaves not only x, but a
invariant, this action is strongly Hamiltonian ((M; x) is a g-Poisson space). Koszul
shows that a symplectic action of a Lie algebra g on an exact symplectic manifold
(M; x ¼ da) that leaves invariant not only x, but also a, is strongly Hamiltonian.
In this book, in Chap. 4, Koszul deﬁnes symplectic G-space as a symplectic
manifold (M; x) on which a Lie group G acts by a symplectic action (an action
which leaves unchanged the symplectic form x). Koszul then introduces and
develops properties of the moment map l (Souriau’s invention) of a Hamiltonian
action of the Lie algebra g. He also deﬁnes the Souriau 2-cocycle, considering that
the difference of two moments of the same Hamiltonian action is a locally constant
function on M, showing that when l is a moment map, for every pair (a, b) of
elements of g, the function cl a; b

Mechanics, which plays a fundamental role in Souriau’s Lie Groups Thermo-
dynamics where it is used to deﬁne an extension of the Fisher Metric from
Information Geometry (what we will call the Souriau–Fisher metric in the following).
To highlight the importance of Koszul’s book, we will illustrate its links of the
detailed tools, including demonstrations or original Koszul extensions, with
Souriau’s Lie Group Thermodynamics, whose applications range from statistical
physics to machine learning in Artiﬁcial Intelligence. Koszul originally developed
Souriau’s model, in the case of non-equivariance, of the action of the group G on
the moment map. As explained in [51] by Thomas Delzant at the 2010 CIRM
conference “Action Hamiltoniennes: invariants et classiﬁcation”, organized with
Michel Brion: “The deﬁnition of the moment map is due to Jean-Marie Souriau….
In the book of Souriau we ﬁnd a proof of the proposition: the map J is equivariant
for an afﬁne action of G on g whose linear part is Ad…. In Souriau’s book, we

space of space-time, obstruction to equivariance (a class of cohomology) is
interpreted as the inert mass of the object under study. We can uniquely deﬁne the
moment map up to an additive constant of integration that can always be chosen to
make the moment map equivariant (a moment map is G-equivariant when G acts on
g via the coadjoint action) if the group is compact or semi-simple. In 1969,
Souriau considered the non-equivariant case where the coadjoint action must be
modiﬁed to make the map equivariant under a 1-cocycle on the group with values
in the dual Lie algebra g.”
The concept and seminal idea of the moment map appeared in the second
volume of Sophus Lie’s book, published in 1890, developed for homogeneous
canonical transformations. Professor Marsden summarized the development of this
concept by Jean-Marie Souriau and Bertram Kostant based on their two testimo-
nials: “In Kostant’s 1965 Phillips lectures at Haverford, and in the 1965 U.S.–
Japan Seminar, Kostant introduced the momentum map to generalize a theorem of
Wang and thereby classiﬁed all homogeneous symplectic manifolds; this is called
today ‘Kostant’s coadjoint orbit covering theorem’… . Souriau introduced the
momentum map in his 1965 Marseille lecture notes and put it in print in 1966. The
momentum map ﬁnally got its formal deﬁnition and its name, based on its physical
interpretation, by Souriau in 1967. Souriau also studied its properties of equiv-
ariance, and formulated the coadjoint orbit theorem. The momentum map appeared
as a key tool in Kostant’s quantization lectures in 1970 [52], and Souriau discussed
it at length in 1970 in his book [31]. Kostant and Souriau realized its importance
for linear representations, a fact apparently not foreseen by Lie.” Souriau’s book is
referred to be published by Dunod in 1970, but Souriau manuscript and book was
available as soon as 1969. Incidentally, Jean-Louis Koszul knew Souriau and
Kostant’s work very well, and as early as 1958, Koszul made a survey of Kostant’s
ﬁrst work at the Bourbaki seminar [53].
In 1969, Souriau also introduced the concept of a coadjoint action of a group on
its moment space in the framework of Thermodynamics, based on the orbit method,
which allows one to deﬁne physical observables like energy, heat, and momentum
or moment as pure geometrical objects. In the ﬁrst step to establishing a new
foundations of thermodynamics, Souriau deﬁned a Gibbs canonical ensemble on a
symplectic manifold M for a Lie group action on M. In classical statistical
mechanics, a state is given by the solution of Liouville’s equation on the phase
space, the partition function. As symplectic manifolds have a completely contin-
uous measure, invariant under diffeomorphisms (the Liouville measure k), Souriau
proved that when statistical states are Gibbs states (as generalized by Souriau), they
are the product of the Liouville measure by the scalar function given by the gen-
eralized partition function eUðbÞ b;UðnÞ

In Chap. 4, Koszul introduces the equivariance of the moment map l. Based on
the deﬁnitions of the adjoint and coadjoint representations of a Lie group or a Lie
algebra, Koszul proves that when (M; x) is a connected Hamiltonian G-space and
l : M ! g a moment of the action of G, there exists an afﬁne action of G on g,
whose linear part is the coadjoint action, for which the moment l is equivariant.
This afﬁne action is obtained by modifying the coadjoint action by means of a
cocycle. This notion is also developed in Chap. 5 for Poisson manifolds.

Afﬁne Representation of Lie Groups and Lie Algebras: Koszul
and Souriau’s Pillars Based on Elie Cartan’s Seminal Work
The afﬁne representation of Lie groups/algebras used by Koszul in this book has
been intensively studied by Souriau, who called the mechanics deduced from this
model “afﬁne mechanics”. We will explain notions such as moment map, equiv-
ariance of moment map, and cocycles through this notion of afﬁne representation of
Lie Groups and Lie Algebras. Previously, we presented Souriau’s work on the
Fig. 10 Sourau’s global scheme of Lie group thermodynamics

afﬁne representation of a Lie group used to elaborate Lie Group Thermodynamics.
Here, we will present Koszul’s original approach to the afﬁne representation of Lie
groups and Lie algebras in a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space, seen as special
examples of actions.
Since the work of Henri Poincaré and Elie Cartan, the theory of differential
forms has become an essential instrument of modern differential geometry, used by
Souriau to identify the space of motions as a symplectic manifold. However, as
observed by Paulette Libermann, except for Henri Poincaré, who wrote shortly
before his death a report on the work of Elie Cartan during his application to the
Sorbonne University, the French mathematicians did not see the importance of
Cartan’s breakthroughs. Souriau followed lectures of Elie Cartan in 1945. Elie
Cartan’s second student was Jean-Louis Koszul. Koszul studied symmetric
homogeneous spaces and deﬁned relations between invariant ﬂat afﬁne connections
to afﬁne representations of Lie algebras, and characterized invariant Hessian metrics
by afﬁne representations of Lie algebras. Koszul provided a correspondence
between symmetric homogeneous spaces with invariant Hessian structures by using
afﬁne representations of Lie algebras and proved that a simply connected symmetric
homogeneous space with invariant Hessian structure is a direct product of a
Euclidean space and a homogeneous self-dual regular convex cone. Let G be a
connected Lie group and let G/K be a homogeneous space on which G acts
effectively. Koszul gave a bijective correspondence between the set of G-invariant
ﬂat connections on G/K, and the set of a certain class of afﬁne representations of the
Lie algebra of G. Koszul’s main theorem is: let G/K be a homogeneous space of a
connected Lie group G and let g and k be the Lie algebras of G and K, assuming that
G/K is endowed with a G-invariant ﬂat connection, then g admits an afﬁne repre-
sentation (f,q) on the vector space E. Conversely, suppose that G is simply con-
nected and that g is endowed with an afﬁne representation, then G/K admits a
G-invariant ﬂat connection.
In the foregoing, the basic tool studied by Koszul is the afﬁne representation of
Lie algebras and Lie groups. To study these structures, Koszul introduced the
following developments. Let X be a convex domain on Rn without any straight
lines, and an associated convex cone VðXÞ ¼ ðkx; xÞ 2 Rn  R=x 2 X; k 2 R þ

then there exists an afﬁne embedding:

Observing Koszul’s afﬁne representations of Lie algebras and Lie groups, we
have to consider a convex Lie group G and a real or complex vector space E of
ﬁnite dimension, Koszul introduced an afﬁne representation of G in E such that:
E ! E
a 7! sa
8s 2 G
ð38Þ
is an afﬁne representation. We set AðEÞ the set of all afﬁne transformation of a real
vector space E, a Lie group called afﬁne representation group of E. The set GLðEÞ
of all regular linear representation of E, a subgroup of AðEÞ. We deﬁne a linear
representation of G in GLðEÞ:
f: G ! GLðEÞ
s 7! fðsÞa ¼ sa  so 8a 2 E
ð39Þ
and a map from G to E:
q: G ! E
s 7! qðsÞ ¼ so 8s 2 G
ð40Þ
then, we have 8s; t 2 G:
fðsÞqðtÞ þ qðsÞ ¼ qðstÞ
ð41Þ
Since fðsÞqðtÞ þ qðsÞ ¼ sqðtÞ  so þ so ¼ sqðtÞ ¼ sto ¼ qðstÞ.
Conversely, if a map q from G to E and a linear representation f from G to
GLðEÞ satisfy the previous equation, then we can deﬁne an afﬁne representation
from G in E, written ðf; qÞ:
Aff ðsÞ : a 7! sa ¼ fðsÞa þ qðsÞ; 8s 2 G; 8a 2 E
ð42Þ
The condition fðsÞqðtÞ þ qðsÞ ¼ qðstÞ is equivalent to the statement that the
following mapping is a homomorphism:
Aff : s 2 G 7! Aff ðsÞ 2 AðEÞ
ð43Þ

We denote by f the afﬁne representation of the Lie algebra g of G, deﬁned by f,
and q the restriction to g of the differential of q (f and q are the differentials of f and
q, respectively). Koszul proved the following equation:

Conclusion
Koszul’s book, which uses a purely algebraic and geometric approach to reinforce
Souriau’s founding work in geometric mechanics, introducing original developments
and proofs, is of major interest to various communities. In the ﬁrst place, the community
of physicists can ﬁnd the mathematical foundations for analytical mechanics, but also for
Lie Group Thermodynamics (the covariant theory of classical thermodynamics intro-
duced by Souriau in parallel with geometric mechanics, but ignored by the great
majority of the community). Second, this book is of great interest for the emerging ﬁeld
known as the “Geometric Science of Information”, in which the generalization of the
Fisher metric is at the heart of the extension of classical tools of Machine Learning and
Artiﬁcial Intelligence to deal with more abstract objects living in homogeneous mani-
folds, groups, and structured matrices. Future of Information Geometry and Artiﬁcial
Intelligence should be based on the pillars developed in Koszul’s book. The “Geometric
Science of Information” community (GSI, www.gsi2017.org) has lost a mathematician
of great value, who enlightened his views by the depth of his thought.

Foreword 3
I was very pleased when Frédéric Barbaresco gave me the opportunity to write a
short presentation for this book. Jean-Louis Koszul, recently deceased, was a highly
distinguished mathematician whom I respected and admired. It is for me an honor
to introduce a book stemming from the lectures he taught in 1983. In this Foreword,
I am going to describe the content of this book and highlight its originality. Then I
will say a few words about some developments in Symplectic and Poisson
geometry, of which I am aware, not discussed in this book, often because they
appeared after 1983.
The Content and Originality of this Book
The ﬁrst chapter offers a very nice presentation of the main properties of symplectic
vector spaces. The framework used at the beginning, slightly more general than that
usually considered, is that of a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V over an arbitrary
ﬁeld k, endowed with a skew-symmetric bilinear form x whose kernel may not be
f0g. Orthogonality with respect to x is deﬁned, as well as isotropic, coisotropic,
Lagrangian, and symplectic vector subspaces, and their main properties are proven.
Then it is assumed that kerx ¼ f0g, which means that ðV; xÞ is a symplectic vector
space. Symplectic bases (often called, in other texts, canonical bases or Darboux
bases) are deﬁned. A long section is devoted to the canonical representation of the
Lie algebra slð2; kÞ in the graded vector space of skew-symmetric multilinear forms
on V. The last two sections of the chapter deal with the linear symplectic group and
with adapted complex structures on a real ﬁnite-dimensional vector space.
Symplectic manifolds are introduced in the second chapter, and a symplectic
homomorphism u from a symplectic manifold ðM1; x1Þ to another symplectic
manifold ðM2; x2Þ is deﬁned. Contrary to the usual practice, it is not assumed that
dimM1 ¼ dimM2. Of course we must have dimM1 	 dimM2, and rank u ¼ dimM1,
but there are interesting cases in which dimM1\dimM2. Several examples are
xxxv

discussed: quotients of R2n by the action of a discrete subgroup of the group of
translations, Kähler manifolds, the complex projective space CPn. A long section,
which uses results obtained in Chap. 1 about the canonical representation of slð2; kÞ
in the graded vector space of skew-symmetric multilinear forms on V, is devoted to
operators on the space of differential forms on a symplectic manifold, allowing the
construction of a representation of the Lie algebra slð2; RÞ. When there exists a
1-form a such that x ¼ d a, it is proven that this representation can be extended to a
representation of the Lie superalgebra ospð2; RÞ. Then symplectic local coordinates
(often called, in other texts, canonical coordinates or Darboux coordinates) are
deﬁned, and a proof by induction of the Darboux theorem is given. In that proof, the
rank of the form x is assumed to be constant, but it may be strictly smaller than the
dimension of the considered manifold. Symplectic vector ﬁelds on a symplectic
manifold are then deﬁned (in other texts, they are often called locally Hamiltonian
vector ﬁelds), as well as Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds. Their properties are discussed.
For example, it is proven that the vector space SðM; xÞ of symplectic vector ﬁelds
is a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of all smooth vector ﬁelds, and that the Lie
bracket of two symplectic vector ﬁelds is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld. After a concise
deﬁnition of de Rham cohomology groups, it is proven that the sequence
f0g ! H0ðM; RÞ ! C1ðM; RÞ ! SðM; xÞ ! H1ðM; RÞ ! f0g
is exact. Examples are given of vector ﬁelds which are symplectic but not
Hamiltonian.
Next, the Poisson bracket of smooth functions on a symplectic manifold ðM; xÞ
is deﬁned. It is proven that C1ðM; RÞ, endowed with the Poisson bracket, is a Lie
algebra, and that the map which associates to each smooth function the corre-
sponding Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld is a Lie algebra homomorphism whose kernel is
the vector subspace H0ðMÞ of locally constant functions.
Let u : P ! Q be a smooth map between two symplectic manifolds ðP; xPÞ and
ðQ; xQÞ. For each smooth vector ﬁeld Y deﬁned on Q, there exists a unique vector
ﬁeld on P, denoted by uY, such that iðuYÞxP ¼ uðiðYÞxQÞ. By using this
correspondence between vector ﬁelds when u is a symplectic homomorphism,
several orthogonality properties are established. It is proven that when u is a
symplectic homomorphism between symplectic manifolds of the same dimension,
for any pair ðf ; gÞ of smooth functions deﬁned on Q, uðff ; ggQ ¼ fuf ; uggP.
This means that u is a Poisson map. However, this result is not stated in these
terms, because Poisson manifolds and Poisson maps (called in this book Poisson
homomorphisms) are deﬁned later, in Chap. 4. This result does not hold when u is a
symplectic homomorphism between two symplectic manifolds of different dimen-
sions. In other words, symplectic homomorphisms between symplectic manifolds
of different dimensions are not Poisson maps.
The set of polynomials deﬁned on R2n (endowed with its canonical symplectic
structure) has both an associative algebra structure (for the ordinary product) and a
Lie algebra structure (for the Poisson bracket). A careful study of its ideals is

presented. Then the Lie algebra of formal symplectic vector ﬁelds deﬁned on a
symplectic manifold is discussed, and it is proven that the algebra of jets of sym-
plectic vector ﬁelds at all points of a symplectic manifold is a simple algebra.
Isotropic, coisotropic, and Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold
are deﬁned, and their main properties are established. The semi-global general-
izations of the Darboux theorem, due to the American mathematician Alan
Weinstein, are given. Then, a method for constructing Lagrangian submanifolds, or
more generally Lagrangian immersions, called the contraction method, is presented.
I believe that this method, called in other texts the use of Morse families, is due to
the Swedish mathematician Lars Hörmander [F3 Hor].1 At the end of the second
chapter, an exercise is proposed in which it is proven that there exists, on each leaf
of a Lagrangian foliation, a ﬂat and torsionless connection. That result was
observed as early as 1953 by the French mathematician Paulette Libermann in her
thesis [F3 Lib].
The symplectic manifolds considered in Chap. 3 are cotangent bundles endowed
with their canonical symplectic form. The Liouville 1-form on the total space of a
cotangent bundle is ﬁrst deﬁned, and its main properties and its behavior under the
prolongation of a diffeomorphism to covectors are presented. The canonical sym-
plectic form is then deﬁned as the opposite of the exterior differential of the
Liouville form. A detailed discussion of symplectic vector ﬁelds on a cotangent
bundle is given, in which the Liouville vector ﬁeld C (the inﬁnitesimal generator of
homotheties in the ﬁbers) is used. Functions which are homogeneous of a given
degree with respect to the Lie derivation along C, in other words, functions whose
restriction to each ﬁber of the cotangent bundle is a polynomial of a given degree
r þ 1, and the associated Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds, are considered and a detailed
study is made of the cases when r ¼ 1, 0, and 1.
A deep study of Lagrangian submanifolds of a cotangent bundle is presented in
the next section. It is ﬁrst proven that the image of a 1-form is a Lagrangian
submanifold if and only if that 1-form is closed. When it is the differential of a
smooth function, that function is called a generating function for the corresponding
Lagrangian submanifold. Then, following the beautiful booklet of Alan Weinstein
[29], more general generating functions are introduced, now deﬁned on an open
subset of the cotangent bundle, whose associated Lagrangian submanifolds may not
be transverse to the ﬁbers. That construction is closely related to the contraction
method described in Chap. 2.
Chapter 4 begins with the deﬁnition of actions of a Lie group and of a Lie
algebra on a smooth manifold. A smooth manifold M on which a Lie group G acts
smoothly on the left is called a G-space. An action of a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie
algebra h on a smooth manifold M is a Lie algebra homomorphism of h in the Lie
algebra of smooth vector ﬁelds on M (equipped with the Lie bracket as composition
law). When the smooth manifold M is endowed with a symplectic form x, a smooth

action on M of a Lie group G is said to be symplectic, and ðM; xÞ is said to be a
symplectic G-space, if the diffeomorphism of M associated to each element in G is a
symplectic diffeomorphism. Similarly, an action on M of a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie
algebra h is said to be symplectic, and ðM; xÞ is said to be a symplectic h-space,
when the vector ﬁeld associated to each element in h is a symplectic vector ﬁeld. It
is shown that the natural prolongation to the cotangent bundle TN of any smooth
action of a Lie group on M is symplectic (later on it will be shown that such an
action is Hamiltonian, after the deﬁnition of that notion). Other examples are
presented. It is shown that each orbit of a symplectic action is an immersed sub-
manifold on which x induces a form of constant rank, and that the set of ﬁxed
points of a symplectic action of a compact Lie group on a symplectic manifold is a
symplectic submanifold.
A symplectic action C of a Lie algebra g on a symplectic manifold ðM; xÞ is said
to be Hamiltonian, and ðM; xÞ is said to be a Hamiltonian g-space, when the vector
ﬁeld CðaÞ associated to each a 2 g is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld. A moment map l
of the Hamiltonian action C is deﬁned: it is a smooth map l from M to the dual
space g of the Lie algebra g such that, for each a 2 g, the smooth function on M:
x 7! hlðxÞ; ai is a Hamiltonian for the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld CðaÞ. The properties
of moment maps are established and it is shown that the difference of two moment
maps for the same Hamiltonian action is a locally constant map. Moreover, for any
moment map l : M ! g and any pair ða; bÞ of elements in g, the function
x 7! clða; bÞðxÞ ¼ fhlðxÞ; ai; hlðxÞ; big  hlðxÞ; ½a; bi
is locally constant on M. Therefore, cl is a skew-symmetric bilinear map on M
which takes its values in H0ðMÞ. It satisﬁes a remarkable identity, a consequence
of the Jacobi identity. Called a closed 2-cochain in this book, it is called a 2-cocycle
of g in other texts. Its restriction to each connected component of M is a
skew-symmetric 2-form on g. When the moment map l is modiﬁed by addition of a
locally constant map u taking its values in g, cl is modiﬁed by addition of the
coboundary of u. The cohomology class of cl remains unchanged: it depends only
on the considered Hamiltonian g-space ðM; xÞ, not on the choice of a moment map
of the g-action. It is denoted by cðM; xÞ. A Hamiltonian g-space ðM; xÞ is said to
be strongly Hamiltonian when cðM; xÞ ¼ f0g. For reasons which will become
clear in the next chapter, strongly Hamiltonian g-spaces are also called Poisson
g-spaces.
Then it is proven that when the symplectic manifold ðM; xÞ is exact, i.e., when
there exists a 1-form a such that x ¼  d a, and when the considered symplectic
action C of the Lie algebra g is such that the Lie derivatives of a with respect to the
vector ﬁelds in CðgÞ all vanish, that action is strongly Hamiltonian. Using the
second Whitehead lemma (quoted without proof), it is shown that any symplectic
action of a semi-simple Lie algebra is strongly Hamiltonian. Several examples are
given of actions which are symplectic but not Hamiltonian, or Hamiltonian but not
strongly Hamiltonian, and of strongly Hamiltonian actions. Some general properties
of the moment map l of a Hamiltonian action are proven. For example, it is shown
xxxviii
Foreword 3

that at each point x of a Hamiltonian g-space ðM; xÞ, the kernel of the map d lx
(denoted by Txl in other texts) and fCaðxÞja 2 gg are two symplectically orthog-
onal vector subspaces of the symplectic vector space ðTxM; xðxÞÞ. Moreover, the
image of Txl in g is the annihilator of the isotropy subalgebra gx of x (called in this
book the orthogonal complement of gx). When the Hamiltonian action of the Lie
algebra g comes from a Hamiltonian action of a Lie group G whose Lie algebra is g,
several consequences are deduced from these properties, about the moment map
and ﬁxed points of the action.
The next section of Chap. 4 is devoted to equivariance properties of the moment
map. Deﬁnitions of the adjoint and coadjoint actions of a Lie group G and of its Lie
algebra g are recalled. Then, it is shown that the moment map l of a Hamiltonian
action of a Lie group G on a connected Hamiltonian G-space ðM; xÞ is equivariant
with respect to the considered action of G on M, and an afﬁne action of that group
on g, obtained by adding to the coadjoint action a closed cochain (in other words, a
cocycle). When the considered action of G is strongly Hamiltonian, that cocycle is a
coboundary; therefore, the addition of a suitably chosen constant to the moment
map yields a moment map equivariant with respect to the coadjoint action. Two
special cases are then considered: when the Lie group G is Abelian, and when
its action on the manifold M is transitive. Readers are referred to the works of
B. Kostant [17] and J.-M. Souriau [23] for more details.
Chapter 5 begins with a statement, without proof, of the main properties of the
Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket. For each integer p  0, the vector space of smooth
p-multivectors on a smooth manifold M is denoted by DpðMÞ, with the convention
D0ðMÞ ¼ C1ðM; RÞ. The direct sum of the vector spaces DpðMÞ for all p 2 NÞ is
denoted by DðMÞ. The Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket is a bilinear, graded
skew-symmetric composition law on DðMÞ which maps DpðMÞ  DqðMÞ into
Dp þ q1ðMÞ. With the use of an element w 2 D2ðMÞ, one can deﬁne a bilinear and
skew-symmetric composition law ðf ; gÞ 7! ff ; ggw ¼ wðd f ; d gÞ on C1ðM; RÞ and
a linear map f 7! Hf from C1ðM; RÞ in the vector space D1ðMÞ of smooth vector
ﬁelds on M. It is shown that the following four conditions are equivalent: (i) the
composition law ðf ; gÞ 7! ff ; ggw satisﬁes the Jacobi identity; (ii) for any pair ðf ; gÞ
of elements in C1ðM; RÞ, Hff ;ggw ¼ ½Hf ; Hg; (iii) for each f 2 C1ðM; RÞ,
½Hf ; w ¼ 0 (the bracket in the left-hand side being the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket
which, in this case, is the Lie derivative of w with respect to the vector ﬁeld Hf );
(iv) ½w; w ¼ 0 (the bracket in the left-hand side being the Schouten–Nijenhuis
bracket). A Poisson structure on M is the structure determined on that manifold by a
2-multivector w 2 D2ðMÞ which satisﬁes these four equivalent conditions. The
manifold M is then called a Poisson manifold and denoted by ðM; wÞ. Poisson
homomorphisms (often called in other texts Poisson maps) between two Poisson
manifolds are then deﬁned.
It is explained in the second section of Chap. 5 that any Poisson manifold is a
union of immersed symplectic manifolds, called its symplectic leaves. The proof of
that property, rather delicate, is not fully given; it is only observed that the result is
true when the rank of the bivector ﬁeld w which determines the Poisson structure is

constant, and asserted that the same is true in the general case. It is proven that each
integral manifold of the family of vector ﬁelds fHf j f 2 C1ðM; RÞg is endowed
with a symplectic form such that, for each point x 2 M and each pair ðf ; gÞ of
smooth functions deﬁned on an open neighborhood of x, the following property is
satisﬁed: ff ; ggwðxÞ, deﬁned as the value at x of the evaluation wðdf ; dgÞ of w on
the two 1-forms d f and dg, is equal to the value at x of the Poisson bracket of the
restrictions of f and g to the integral manifold of fHf j f 2 C1ðM; RRÞg which
contains x, calculated with the use of its symplectic form as indicated in Chap. 2.
A Poisson manifold which has only one symplectic leaf is a symplectic manifold,
the bivector ﬁeld w being, in a certain sense, the inverse of its symplectic form.
A simple example is given at the end of that section.
Poisson structures on the dual vector space of a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie
algebra are studied in detail in the last section of Chap. 5. The bracket of a
ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra g, considered as a composition law of linear func-
tions deﬁned on the dual space g, is ﬁrst extended to a composition law on
C1ðg; RÞ. The Poisson structure so obtained on g was observed by Sophus Lie
and rediscovered, much later, independently by A. Kirillov, B. Kostant, and J.-M.
Souriau. It is often called the canonical Lie–Poisson structure or the Kirillov–
Kostant–Souriau structure on g. By observing that the transpose of a Lie algebra
homomorphism is a Poisson homomorphism, it is proven that when g is the Lie
algebra of a Lie group G, the canonical Lie–Poisson structure on g is preserved by
the coadjoint action of G, and that the symplectic leaves of g are the orbits of the
coadjoint action, restricted to the neutral component of G. Restricted to each orbit,
the action of G is Hamiltonian and has the canonical injection of that orbit in g as
moment map. It is then proven that the Ad-equivariant moment map of a strongly
Hamiltonian action is a Poisson homomorphism.
The remainder of that section extends these results to Hamiltonian actions,
which may not be strongly Hamiltonian, of a Lie group G on a connected sym-
plectic manifold ðM; xÞ. For any moment map l of that action, it was proven in
Chap. 4 that there exists an afﬁne action of G on the dual space g of g with respect
to which l is equivariant. That action is obtained by adding to the coadjoint action,
which is its linear part, a smooth map ul : G ! g which is a 1-cocycle of G with
values in g for the coadjoint action. It is now proven that the canonical Lie–
Poisson structure on g can be modiﬁed, by addition of the 1-cocycle of g with
values in g associated to ul, in such a way that for this modiﬁed Poisson structure,
the moment map l becomes a Poisson homomorphism. This remarkable result was
obtained for the ﬁrst time, I believe, by J.-M. Souriau, and appears in his book [23].
The proof presented here is slightly different, and more algebraic. Moreover, it is
proven here that when the Lie group G is simply connected, the 1-cocycle ul of G
and the associated 1-cocycle of its Lie algebra for which l is an equivariant Poisson
homomorphism can be deduced from the 2-cocycle of g introduced in Chap. 4.
Chapter 5 ends with proposed exercises related to Lie groups and Lie algebras
endowed with a symplectic structure, in which reference to the works of Vinberg is
made [25].

Finally, Chap. 6, the most original part of this book, is a short introduction to
supermanifolds, in particular, symplectic supermanifolds.
Some Developments in Symplectic and Poisson Geometry
Since 1983, several textbooks have appeared in the ﬁelds of symplectic and Poisson
geometry, for example [F3 Cann, F3 Fo, F3 Lib-Ma], in which the readers will ﬁnd
other viewpoints on the subjects dealt with in this book. Readers interested in more
specialized and advanced results are referred to the proceedings of conferences, for
example [F3 Do, F3 Gra-Urb, F3 Mars-Ra]. Methods in symplectic geometry are
used for the study of global geometric properties of completely integrable
Hamiltonian systems in the book by M. Audin, A. Cannas da Silva, and E. Lerman
[F3 Au-Can-Ler] and in the book by R. Cushman and L. M. Bates [F3 Cush-Ba] for
classical mechanical systems.
Local properties of Poisson manifolds were thoroughly studied by A. Weinstein
[F3 W1]. There exists on a Poisson manifold a cohomology discovered by
A. Lichnerowicz, deﬁned by means of the Poisson bivector ﬁeld, called the
Lichnerowicz–Poisson cohomology. When the considered Poisson manifold is in
fact a symplectic manifold, its Lichnerowicz–Poisson cohomology coincides with
its de Rham cohomology. For general Poisson manifolds, the Lichnerowicz–
Poisson cohomology is often more complicated than the de Rham cohomology
because it reﬂects the topological and geometrical properties of the foliation of that
manifold in symplectic leaves. It was studied by P. Xu [F3 Xu] and many other
authors.
Remarkable properties of moment maps, not discussed in this book, have been
discovered since 1982. The readers are referred to the important papers of
M. Atiyah [F3 Ati], V. Guillemin and S. Sternberg [F3 Gu-Ster1, F3 Gu-Ster2],
F. Kirwan [F3 Kir], T. Delzant [F3 Del], and to the beautiful book of M. Audin [F3
Au]. A deep study of moment maps and their use for reduction can be found in the
monumental book by J.-P. Ortega and T. Ratiu [F3 Or-Ra].
Following the pioneering work of F. Magri [F3 Mag, F3 Ma-Mo], vector ﬁelds
deﬁned on a smooth manifold which are Hamiltonian with respect to two different
symplectic or Poisson structures, with two different Hamiltonian functions, called
bi-Hamiltonian systems, were intensively studied by many authors. Very often
these systems are integrable and also occur in the more general setting of evolution
partial differential equations.
Several important new results were found in the geometry of Poisson manifolds.
Jean-Louis Koszul discovered the composition law on the graded vector space of
differential forms of all degrees on a Poisson manifold [F3 Kosz]. Its restriction to
the vector subspace of differential forms of degree 1 had already been observed a
little earlier by F. Magri and C. Morosi [F3 Ma-Mo], and a little later by P. Dazord
and D. Sondaz [F3 Da-Son]. It was then found by A. Weinstein, P. Dazord,
Foreword 3
xli

D. Sondaz, and probably many others [F3 W2, F3 W3, F3 Da-W, F3 Da-Son] that
the tangent space to a Poisson manifold is endowed with a Lie algebroid structure.
J.-P. Dufour and N. T. Zung’s book [F3 Du-Zu] very thoroughly presents normal
forms of Poisson structures. The book by C. Laurent-Gengoux, A. Pichereau, and
P. Vanhaecke is an invaluable reference work about Poisson structures and their
applications.
A Poisson Lie group is a Lie group G endowed with a Poisson structure for
which the group composition law is a Poisson homomorphism from G  G
equipped with the product Poisson structure, to G. Poisson Lie groups were
introduced by V. G. Drinfel’d [F3 Dri] as classical analogues of quantum groups.
The Lie algebra of a Poisson–Lie group has a remarkable property and is often
called a Lie bialgebra: its dual vector space too is endowed with a Lie algebra
structure. Poisson–Lie groups have been extensively studied by many authors, in
particular, by J.-H. Lu and A. Weinstein [F3 Lu, F3 Lu-W].
Research on the symplectization of Poisson manifolds (the determination of a
symplectic manifold of which the considered Poisson manifold is a quotient) and on
the integration of Lie algebroids led A. Weinstein, S. Zakzrewski, M. Karasev, and
others to the consideration of Lie groupoids in relation with Poisson manifolds and
the deﬁnition of symplectic groupoids [F3 W2, F3 W3, F3 W4, F3 W5]. The
readers are referred to the book by K.C.H. Mackenzie [F3 Mack] for a thorough
study of Lie groupoids and to the booklet by A. Cannas da Silva and A. Weinstein
[F3 Cann-W] for symplectic groupoids, the links of Lie groupoids with Poisson
geometry, and more references.
Poisson groupoids, i.e., Lie groupoids whose total space is endowed with a
suitable Poisson structure, generalize both Poisson Lie groups and symplectic
groupoids. Hamiltonian actions of a Poisson groupoid on a symplectic or Poisson
manifold and moment maps for these actions can be deﬁned, which generalize
Hamiltonian actions and moment maps for a Lie group action [F3 Mack-Xu, F3
Gra-Urb, F3 Mars-Ra].
Symplectic topology is a development of symplectic geometry which appeared
toward the end of the last century, in which symplectic geometric methods are used
for the proof of topological properties of symplectic or contact manifolds, and for
the deﬁnition of topological invariants. That development stemmed from the
seminal work of M. Gromov [F3 Grom] and is now a very active domain of
research. Readers interested in that subject are referred to the books by D. McDuff
and D. Salamon [F3 McD-Sa] and by L. Polterovich and D. Rosen [F3 Pol-Ros]
and the proceedings of an international conference [F3 Eli-Tray].

Preface
I was invited to give lectures at Nankai University in the spring of 1983. This book
is based on the lecture notes, translated and written (with minor modiﬁcations) by
Yi Ming Zou. We hope to introduce symplectic manifold theory to the readers
through this introductory book.
The development of analytical mechanics provided the basic concepts of sym-
plectic structures. The term symplectic structure is due largely to analytical
mechanics. But in this book, the applications of symplectic structure theory to
mechanics are not discussed in any detail; and some of the important parts of the
theory, especially the application in analysis, are not discussed at all. For those
topics, we refer the readers to the references [1, 2, 7, 26]. The emphasis of this book
is on the differential properties of manifolds with symplectic structures.
The ﬁrst chapter of the book discusses the symplectic structures of vector spaces.
The second chapter discusses symplectic manifolds and introduces the basic con-
cepts and the basic results to the readers. We prove the existence of symplectic
coordinates (Darboux Theorem) as early as possible in Chap. 2, so the readers can
see the importance of the formulas we give in later discussions. The connection
between the differentiable functions and the inﬁnitesimal automorphisms of the
symplectic structure on a symplectic manifold is the foundation of the symplectic
manifold theory, and it will be discussed in Sects. 2.4 and 2.5. This chapter ends
with some results on the submanifolds, especially the Lagrangian submanifolds, of
a symplectic manifold.
The existence of canonical symplectic structures on cotangent bundles clariﬁes a
lot of questions associated with symplectic structures. Chapter 3 introduces the
results on cotangent bundles and symplectic vector ﬁelds on cotangent bundles.
Chapter 4 discusses symplectic G-spaces, that is, symplectic manifolds with
symplectic structures that are invariant under the actions of some Lie group G. For
these symplectic manifolds, certain maps we call moment maps provide with us an
effective study tool. The study of symplectic G-spaces is a rich topic in symplectic
manifold theory, and there are still many problems that deserve further study. The
study of the symplectic G-spaces leads us to the study of the dual structures of Lie
algebras and the geometry properties of the so-called coadjoint representations. We
xlv

will discuss these subjects in Sect. 4.3, which will last until Chap. 5. In Chap. 5, we
ﬁrst introduce some general properties of the so-called Poisson manifolds. The
concept of Poisson structures is a generalization of the concept of symplectic
structures, and it allows us to consider the classical contents from a new viewpoint.
Poisson structures start from the concept of contravariant skew-symmetric tensors.
In Sect. 5.3, we will give the precise results for the Poisson structures in the dual
spaces of Lie algebras.
Chapter 6, the last chapter, is a special chapter. The purpose of this chapter is to
introduce the generalizations of the concepts discussed in Chaps. 2 and 3 to
supermanifolds. We only discuss ð0; nÞ-dimensional supermanifolds, that is, we
only consider differentiable properties, not geometric properties. In this chapter, we
mainly describe the basic properties, omit most the proofs. This is because the
materials discussed are rather basic; and, we think that these omitted proofs can
serve as exercises for the readers.
Finally, we wish to express our sincere thanks to Professor Zhi-da Yan for his
help in the process of the translation and writing of this book.

1.1
Skew-Symmetric Forms
We denote by V a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld k of characteristic not
equal to 2, and denote by Ap(V ) the vector space of skew-symmetric p-linear forms
on V with values in k. In particular, A0(V ) = k and A1(V ) is the dual vector space
V ∗of V .
Deﬁnition 1.1.1 The exterior product α ∧β of a p-form α ∈Ap(V ) and a q-form
β ∈Aq(V ) is the (p + q)-form whose value at (x1, . . . , x p+q) ∈V × · · · × V

is
given by
(α ∧β)(x1, . . . , x p+q) =

τ∈S(p,q)
sg(τ)α(xτ(1), . . . , xτ(p))β(xτ(p+1), . . . , xτ(p+q)),
where S(p, q) is the set of the permutations of the set {1, 2, . . . , p + q} which satisfy
τ(1) < τ(2) < · · · < τ(p) and τ(p + 1) < τ(p + 2) < · · · < τ(p + q),
and sg(τ) is the signature of the permutation τ (its value is 1 when the permutation
τ is even and −1 when τ is odd).
The exterior product is associative, therefore it deﬁnes a graded algebra structure
on A(V ) = 
p Ap(V ). Using the exterior product deﬁnition, we can check that the
graded algebra A(V ) is Z2-commutative, that is, when α ∈Ap(V ) and β ∈Aq(V ),
we have
α ∧β = (−1)pqβ ∧α.
Let ( f1, . . . , fn) be a basis of V and let λ be a map from {1, 2, . . . , p} into
{1, 2, . . . , n}. We set

f λ = fλ(1) ∧· · · ∧fλ(p).
When λ runs through all maps from the set {1, 2, . . . , p} into the set {1, 2, . . . , n}
such that
λ(1) < λ(2) < · · · < λ(p),
the resulted collection of f λ forms a basis of the space Ap(V ). If n = dim V , then
for any integer p ≥0, we have dim Ap(V ) =
n
p
	
.
Deﬁnition 1.1.2 The inner product of a p-form α ∈Ap(V )with an element x ∈V
is the (p −1)-form, denoted by i(x)α, whose value is given by
i(x)α(x1, . . . , x p−1) = α(x, x1, . . . , x p−1),
∀x1, . . . , x p−1 ∈V.
Using the deﬁnition of i(x), we see that the map x −→i(x) is a linear map from
V into the space End

A(V )

of endomorphisms of A(V ). For arbitrary x, y ∈V , we
have
i(x) ◦i(y) + i(y) ◦i(x) = 0.
(1.1.1)
When α ∈Ap(V ) and β ∈A(V ), we have
i(x)(α ∧β) = (i(x)α) ∧β + (−1)pα ∧(i(x)β).
(1.1.2)
This property means that i(x) is a Z2-derivation of the graded algebra A(V ).
Deﬁnitions 1.1.3 The kernel of a skew-symmetric p-form α on a vector space V
is the vector subspace of V , denoted by ker α, formed by all elements x ∈V such
that i(x)α = 0. The rank of α, denoted by rankα, is the codimension of ker α. Thus
rankα = dim V −dim ker α.
Deﬁnition 1.1.4 Let V , W be two vector spaces over k, and let f be a linear map
from V to W. For β ∈Ap(W) and x1, . . . , x p ∈V , we set

A( f )β

(x1, . . . , x p) = β( f (x1), . . . , f (x p)).
This formula deﬁnes a p-form A( f )β ∈Ap(V ) called the pullback of β by f .
The map A( f ) : Ap(W) −→Ap(V ), extended by linearity to a linear map A( f ) :
A(W) −→A(V ), is a graded homomorphism of degree 0 of graded algebras, called
the pullback of forms by f .
From the deﬁnition of A( f ), we see that when f is injective (or onto), then A( f )
is also injective (or onto).
The easy proof of the following result is left to the readers as an exercise.
Proposition 1.1.5 Let α ∈Ap(V ), let N be a vector subspace of V such that N ⊂
ker α, and let q be the canonical projection from V onto V/N. There exists a unique

p-form β ∈Ap(V/N), called the pushforward of α by the projection q, such that
α = A(q)β. Its kernel is ker β = q(ker α).
1.2
Orthogonality Deﬁned by a Skew-Symmetric 2-Form
Deﬁnitions 1.2.1 Let ω be a skew-symmetric 2-form on a ﬁnite-dimensional vector
space V . Two elements x and y ∈V are said to be orthogonal (with respect to ω) if
ω(x, y) = 0. The orthogonal complement of a vector subspace E of V is the vector
subspace E⊥of V formedbyallelements x ∈V whichsatisfyω(x, y) = 0, ∀y ∈E.
As an exercise, the reader can try to prove the properties stated without proof in
the proposition below.
Proposition 1.2.2 With the assumptions and notations of Deﬁnition1.2.1, we have
the following properties.
(1) For any vector subspace E ⊂V ,
E⊥⊃ker ω,
(E⊥)⊥= E + ker ω,

(E⊥)⊥⊥= E⊥.
(2) If E and F are two vector subspaces of V , then (E + F)⊥= E⊥∩F⊥.
(3) If the vector subspaces E and F of V satisfy E ⊂F, then E⊥⊃F⊥.
(4) If the vector subspaces E and F of V satisfy ker ω ⊂E ∩F, then (E ∩F)⊥=
E⊥+ F⊥.
Lemma 1.2.3 Let ω ∈A2(V ) and let E be a vector subspace of V . Then we have
dim E⊥= dim V −dim E + dim(E ∩ker ω).
Proof By the deﬁnition of the inner product (1.1.2), the map x −→i(x)ω, x ∈V ,
is a linear map with values in V ∗, and its kernel is ker ω. The dimension of the image
of E is therefore dim

i(E)ω

= dim E −dim(E ∩ker ω). By duality, the image
i(E)ω is the orthogonal complement of E⊥. Its dimension is therefore equal to the
codimension of E⊥.
□
Deﬁnitions 1.2.4 Let ω be a skew-symmetric 2-form on a vector space V . A vector
subspace E of V is said to be
• an isotropic vector subspace of (V, ω) if E ⊂E⊥,
• a coisotropic vector subspace of (V, ω) if E ⊃E⊥,
• a Lagrangian vector subspace of (V, ω) if E = E⊥,
• a symplectic vector subspace of (V, ω) if E ∩E⊥= {0}.

Some Algebra Basics
Using Deﬁnitions 1.2.4, we can see that any vector subspace of dimension ≤1 is
isotropic, and that any vector subspace of codimension ≤1 which contains ker ω is
coisotropic. We can also see that, under the order relation of set inclusion, Lagrangian
subspaces are maximal isotropic subspaces as well as minimal coisotropic subspaces.
Proposition 1.2.5 Let ω ∈A2(V ) and let L be a Lagrangian vector subspace of
(V, ω). We have
rank ω = 2(dim L −dim ker ω).
Proof Since L is a Lagrangian subspace, L ∩ker ω = L⊥∩ker ω = ker ω. Thus,
by Lemma 1.2.3, dim L = dim V −dim L + dim ker ω.
Corollary 1.2.6 The rank of any skew-symmetric 2-form ω on V is an even number,
and the dimensions of all Lagrangian vector subspaces of the space (V, ω) are the
same.
Proposition 1.2.7 Let ω ∈A2(V ) and and let W be a coisotropic vector subspace
of (V, ω). For any Lagrangian vector subspace L of (V, ω), L ∩W + W ⊥is a
Lagrangian vector subspace of (W, ω|W).
Proof Since both L and W are coisotropic, ker ω ⊂L ∩W. Thus
(L ∩W)⊥= L⊥+ W ⊥= L + W ⊥.
Again, since W is coisotropic,
(L ∩W)⊥∩W = (L + W ⊥) ∩W = L ∩W + W ⊥.
This shows that the orthogonal complement of L ∩W + W ⊥in (W, ω|W) is itself.
Proposition 1.2.8 Let ω ∈A2(V ), let N be a vector subspace of V that contained in
ker ω, and let q : V −→V/N be the canonical projection. Let ω′ ∈A2(V/N) be the
unique 2- form which satisﬁes the relation A(q)ω′ = ω. Then the map L −→q(L)
is a bijection from the set of Lagrangian vector subspaces of (V, ω) onto the set of
Lagrangian subspaces of (V/N, ω′).
Proof For any x and y ∈V , we have ω′
q(x), q(y)

= ω(x, y). Thus for any vector
subspace E ⊂V , q(E⊥) is the orthogonal complement of q(E) with respect to ω′.
Therefore, if L is a Lagrangian vector subspace of (V, ω), then q(L) is a Lagrangian
vector subspace of (V/N, ω′). Since N ⊂ker ω, any Lagrangian vector subspace
of (V, ω) contains N. Therefore L = q−1
q(L)

, which proves that the map L −→
q(L) is injective.
To prove that this map is also onto, let L′ be a Lagrangian subspace of (V/N, ω′),
and let L = q−1(L′). Then q(L⊥) = q(L)⊥= L′, thus L⊥+ N = L + N. Also
since N ⊂ker ω ⊂L⊥and N = ker q ⊂L, we have L⊥= L. Therefore L is a
Lagrangian vector subspace of (V, ω) and q(L) = L′.

1.2 Orthogonality Deﬁned by a Skew-Symmetric 2-Form
5
Proposition 1.2.9 Let ω ∈A2(V ), let L be a Lagrangian vector subspace of (V, ω),
and let J be the set of all isotropic subspaces E of (V, ω) such that E ∩L = {0}.
If F is a maximal element of J for the order relation of set inclusion, then V is the
direct sum of L and F.
Proof For any x ∈F⊥, F + kx is an isotropic vector subspace of (V, ω). Therefore
we have either F + kx ⊂F or (F + kx) ∩L ̸= {0}. In both cases, F⊥⊂F + L.
Thus
F⊥∩L = F⊥∩L⊥= (F + L)⊥⊂(F⊥)⊥= F + ker ω.
So
F⊥∩L ⊂(F + ker ω) ∩L = ker ω,
and
V = (F⊥∩L)⊥= F + ker ω + L⊥= F + L.
□
Deﬁnition 1.2.10 Under the assumptions of Proposition 1.2.9, a maximal element
of J is called an isotropic complement vector subspace of the Lagrangian vector
subspace L.
Corollary 1.2.11 (First corollary of Proposition 1.2.9) Let L be a Lagrangian sub-
space of (V, ω), and let f1, . . . , fr be linearly independent 1-forms in the dual space
V ∗of V such that
L =

1≤i≤r
ker fi.
Then there are r linearly independent 1-forms fr+1, . . . , f2r in V ∗such that
f1, . . . , fr, fr+1, . . . , f2r
are linearly independent and ω = r
i fi ∧fr+i.
Proof Let F be an isotropic complement subspace of L in V . Let e1, . . . , er be a set
of elements of F satisfying fi(e j) = δi j, and let fr+ j = i(e j)ω, j = 1, . . . ,r. Then
since F is isotropic,
i(e j) fr+i = ω(ei, e j) = 0,
i, j = 1, . . . ,r.
Thus,
i(e j)(ω −

is 0, and by the deﬁnition of F, V = F + L. Therefore ω = r
i=1 fi ∧fr+i. To
prove that f1, . . . , f2r are linearly independent, note that the kernel of ω contains

1≤i≤2r ker fi, but its kernel has dimension 2 dim L −dim V = dim V −2r, thus
f1, . . . , f2r are linearly independent.
□
Corollary 1.2.12 (Second corollary of Proposition 1.2.9) Let L be a Lagrangian
subspace of (V, ω). Then there exists a Lagrangian subspace ˜L of (V, ω) such that
L ∩˜L = ker ω,
and thus V = L + ˜L.
Proof Keep the notations in Corollary 1.2.11, let ˜L = 
1≤i≤r ker fr+i, then the
desired result follows.
□
Corollary 1.2.13 (Third corollary of Proposition 1.2.9) If k has characteristic 0,
and the rank of ω is 2r, then ω’s rth exterior power ωr ̸= 0 and its (r + 1)th exterior
power ωr+1 = 0.
Proof Keep the notations in Corollary 1.2.11, and let ω = r
i=1 fi ∧fr+i. Then
ωr = r! f1 ∧fr+1 ∧f2 ∧fr+2 ∧· · · ∧fr ∧f2r

Thus the desired results hold.

Symplectic Vector Spaces, Symplectic Bases
In this section, V is assumed to be a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld k of
characteristic ̸=2.
Deﬁnition 1.3.1 A symplectic form on the vector space V is a skew-symmetric 2-
form whose kernel ker ω = 0. The vector space V endowed with a symplectic form
ω is called a symplectic vector space and is denoted by (V, ω).
The dimension of a symplectic vector space (V, ω), being equal to the rank of ω,
is always an even integer 2n. The dimension of any Lagrangian vector subspace of
(V, ω) is n, half the dimension of V .
Examples 1.3.2
1. Let W be an r-dimensional vector space over the ﬁeld k, and let W ∗be the dual
space of W. For any x1 and x2 ∈W and any f1 and f2 ∈W ∗, we set
ω(( f1, x1), ( f2, x2)) = f1(x2) −f2(x1).

1.3 Symplectic Vector Spaces, Symplectic Bases

The 2-form ω so deﬁned is a symplectic form on W ∗× W. It is easy to see that
W ∗× {0} and {0} × W are both Lagrangian vector subspaces of (W ∗× W, ω).

space(V, ω)hasaLagrangiancomplementsubspace in V ,thatis,thereexistsanother
Lagrangian vector subspace ˜L of (V, ω) such that L ∩˜L = {0} and V = L + ˜L.
Proposition 1.3.3 Let (V, ω) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic vector space, and let
L1 and L2 two complementary Lagrangian vector subspaces of (V, ω). For any basis
(e1, . . . , en) of L1, there exists a unique basis (en+1, . . . , e2n) of L2 such that
ω(ei, en+ j) = δi j,
1 ≤i, j ≤n.
Proof The map x −→(i(x)ω)|L1 is an isomorphism from L2 to the dual space L∗
1
of L1. Let ( f1, . . . , fn) be the basis of L∗
1 dual to (e1, . . . , en). For any 1 ≤j ≤n,
choose en+ j ∈L2 such that (i(en+ j)ω)|L1 = −f j, then (en+1, . . . , e2n) is a basis of
L2 and
ω(ei, en+ j) = f j(ei) = δi j,
1 ≤i, j ≤n.

Deﬁnition 1.3.4 A symplectic basis1 of a 2n-dimensional symplectic vector space
(V, ω) is a basis (e1, . . . , e2n) of V satisﬁes
ω(ei, en+ j) = δi j
and ω(ei, e j) = ω(en+i, en+ j) = 0,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
According to Corollary 1.2.12 and Proposition 1.3.3, any symplectic vector space
(V, ω) has a symplectic basis. Under a symplectic basis, the matrix of ω has the form
J2n =

where In is the n × n identity matrix.

called, in other texts, a canonical basis or a Darboux basis.

we have ω = n

Let (V, ω) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic space over k. For α ∈Ar(V ), let
μ(α) be the endomorphism of A(V ) deﬁned by β −→α ∧β, β ∈A(V ). Then
μ(α) is a degree r endomorphism of A(V ), that is, it maps each subspace Ap(V )
into the subspace Ap+r(V ). In particular X = μ(ω) is a degree 2 endomorphism.
Let (e1, . . . , e2n) be a symplectic basis of (V, ω), then the endomorphism Y =
n
j=1 i(e j) i(en+ j) is a degree −2 endomorphism.
Lemma 1.4.1 For every x ∈V ,
i(x) = Y ◦μ( f ) −μ( f ) ◦Y,
where f = i(x)ω.
Proof According to the deﬁnition, for any e j, 1 ≤j ≤2n, i(e j) is a degree −1 Z2-
derivation, that is, for any α ∈Ap(V ) and any β ∈Aq(V ),
i(e j)(α ∧β) = (i(e j)α) ∧β + (−1)pα ∧(i(e j)β).
Thus for any β ∈A(V ) we have
(i(e j) ◦μ( f ))(β) = i(e j)((i(x)ω) ∧β)
= (i(e j) i(x)ω) ∧β −(i(x)ω) ∧(i(e j)β),
(μ( f ) ◦i(e j))(β) = f ∧(i(e j)β) = (i(x)ω) ∧(i(e j)β).
2We assume that the readers have a basic knowledge of Lie algebras, Lie groups, and representation
theory. The readers who need to improve their knowledge of these subjects are referred to [13, 31].

Also
μ( f (e j))(β) = f (e j) ∧β = ω(x, e j)β.
Thus
i(e j) ◦μ( f ) + μ( f ) ◦i(e j) = μ( f (e j)),
1 ≤j ≤2n.
Now let x = 2n
j=1 x je j. Then
μ( f (e j)) = −xn+ j,
μ( f (en+ j)) = x j,

Now we prove the endomorphism Y of A(V ) deﬁned just before Lemma 1.4.1 is
independent of the choice of the symplectic basis (e1, . . . , e2n).
In fact, let (e′
1, . . . , e′
2n) be another symplectic basis of (V, ω), and let
Y ′ =
n

j=1
i(e′
j) i(e′
n+ j).
Then by Lemma 1.4.1
(Y ′ −Y) ◦μ( f ) = μ( f ) ◦(Y ′ −Y)
holds for any 1-form f = i(x)ω, and thus it holds for any f ∈V ∗. Then for any
f ∈V ∗, the kernel of Y ′ −Y is an invariant subspace of μ( f ). Thus since the algebra

Some Algebra Basics
A(V ) is generated by V ∗= A1(V ), the kernel of Y ′ −Y is an ideal of A(V ). But it
is obvious that the identity of A(V ) is in the kernel of Y ′ −Y. Therefore Y ′ = Y.
If ( f1, . . . , f2n) is the basis of V ∗dual to the basis (e1, . . . , e2n), then
i(e j)ω = fn+ j,
i(en+i)ω = −f j,
1 ≤j ≤n.
Thus by formulas (1.1.1) and (1.1.2)
[Y, X] = Y ◦X −X ◦Y =

μ( f j) ◦i(e j) −n · id,
where id is the identity map. Since the endomorphism 2n
j=1 μ( f j) ◦i(e j) of A(V )
is a degree zero derivation of A(V ), it is easy to see that it is the identity map on
A1(V ), thus its restriction on Ap(V ) is equal to p · id. Let H = [Y, X], then for any
α ∈Ap(V ), H(α) = (p −n)α.

then ρ is a linear representation of the Lie algebra sl(2, k) on the space A(V ).
Proof In fact, since [Y, X] = H, and X and Y are derivations of degree 2 and degree
−2, respectively, H is a degree 0 derivation of A(V ). Direct computation shows that
[H, X] = 2X, [H, Y] = −2Y, thus ρ is a representation of sl(2, k).
It is obvious that the eigenvectors of H in A(V ) are homogenous elements of
A(V ). In particular, we call the eigenvectors of H that are contained in ker X\{0}
the primitive elements of the representation ρ (see Ref. [13]). According to the
representation theory of Lie algebras, if ϕ ∈A(V ) is a primitive element and H(ϕ) =
rϕ, then r is an integer ≥0, and the following elements:
ϕ, Y(ϕ), . . . , Y r(ϕ),
form a basis of a simple sl(2, k) submodule in A(V ). Since it follows from H(ϕ) =
rϕ that ϕ ∈An+r(V ), thus all primitive elements have gradings ≥n. Since ker X is
a subspace of A(V ) generated by the primitive elements, so ker X is contained in
An(V ) + An+1(V ) + · · · + A2n(V ).

1. Let ωn be the nth exterior power of ω, then 0 ̸= ωn ∈A2n(V ) and ωn is a primi-
tive element. Under the representation ρ, it generates an n + 1-dimensional sl(2, k)
submodule
k + kω + · · · + kωn.
2. Since X is a degree 2 derivation, so any nonzero element in A2n−1(V ) is a primitive
element. Each of these primitive element generates an n-dimensional submodule.
Proposition 1.4.4 For r = 0, 1, . . . , n, we have
(1) Xr maps An−r(V ) isomorphically onto An+r(V );
(2) Y r maps An+r(V ) isomorphically onto An−r(V ).

Symplectic Groups
Let (V1, ω1) and (V2, ω2) be two symplectic vector spaces over a ﬁeld k, and let ϕ
be a vector space isomorphism from V1 to V2. If ϕ satisﬁes ω1 = A(ϕ)ω2, then it is
called an isomorphism from (V1, ω1) onto (V2, ω2).
There exists an isomorphism between (V1, ω1) and (V2, ω2) if and only if
dim V1 = dim V2. In fact, if both V1 and V2 are 2n-dimensional, let (e1, . . . , e2n)
(respectively, (e′
1, . . . , e′
2n)) be a symplectic basis of V1 (respectively, V2), then the
map ϕ : V1 −→V2 deﬁned by ϕ(ei) = e′
i, i = 1, . . . , 2n, is an isomorphism from
(V1, ω1) to (V2, ω2). The necessary condition is obvious.
Let (V, ω) be a symplectic space. An automorphism of (V, ω) is an isomorphism
from (V, ω) onto itself. So an automorphism s of (V, ω) is an element of the linear
transformation group Gl(V ) that satisﬁes the following equation:
ω(sx, sy) = ω(x, y),
∀x, y ∈V.
It is easy to see that the automorphisms of (V, ω) form a subgroup of Gl(V ), we de-
note this subgroup by Sp(V, ω). In particular, the automorphism group of the canon-
ical symplectic space (k2n, ω) is denoted by Sp(2n, k). If k = R, then Sp(2n, k) is
denoted simply as Sp(2n), and is called the 2n-dimensional symplectic group.

Some Algebra Basics
Let (e1, . . . , e2n) be a symplectic basis of (V, ω). Let S ∈Gl(2n, k) be a ma-
trix. Then S is the matrix of an automorphism of (V, ω) with respect to the basis
(e1, . . . , e2n) if and only if t SJ2nS = J2n, where t S is the transpose of S, and J2n is
the matrix of ω with respect to the basis (e1, . . . , e2n), that is

where A, B, C, D are all n × n matrices. Then S ∈Sp(2n, k) if and only if
tC A −t AC = 0,
tC B −t AD = In,
t DA −t BC = −In,
t DB −t BD = 0.
(1.5.1)
Sincedet J2n = 1,if S ∈Sp(2n, k),thentheidentity t SJ2nS = J2n implies(det S)2 =
1. More precisely, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 1.5.1 Let (V, ω) be a symplectic space, then for any s ∈Sp(V, ω), we
have det(s) = 1.
Proof In fact, if dim V = 2n, then since A(s)ω = ω, we have A(s)ωn = ωn. Since
ωn ∈A2n(V ), A(s)ωn = det(s)ωn. If V is a vector space over a ﬁeld k of charac-
teristic 0, then we have ωn ̸= 0 (Corollary 1.2.13), det(s) = 1. For the general case,
use the divided power ω[n] instead of ωn for the discussion, just note that ω[n] is also
a basis of A2n(V ).
Let T be an indeterminate. We denote by k[T ] the one variable polynomial ring
with the indeterminate T over k.
Proposition 1.5.2 Let (V, ω) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic space, and let s ∈
Sp(V, ω). If P ∈k[T ] is the characteristic polynomial of s, then we have
T 2n P

T
	
= P(T ).
Proof In fact, denote simply J2n = J, I2n = I, then J 2 = −I. If S is the matrix of
s with respect to some symplectic basis of V , then since t SJ S = J, t S = −J S−1J.
Thus
P(T ) = det(S −T I) = det(t S −T I)
= det(−J S−1J −T I) = det(S−1 −T I).
Moreover, det(S) = 1, therefore

Let L beaLagrangianvectorsubspaceofasymplecticvectorspace(V, ω).Forany
s ∈Sp(V, ω), s(L) is obviously a Lagrangian subspace of (V, ω). Thus Sp(V, ω)
acts on the set of all Lagrangian subspaces of (V, ω).
Proposition 1.5.3 Thegroup Sp(V, ω) acts transitivelyontheset of all pairs (L, ˆL),
where L and ˆL are arbitrary mutual Lagrangian complementary Lagrangian sub-
spaces of (V, ω).
Proof Infact,accordingtoProposition1.3.3,foranyLagrangiancomplementarypair
(L, ˆL), there exists a symplectic basis (e1, . . . , e2n) of (V, ω) such that e1, . . . , en
form a basis of L and en+1, . . . , e2n form a basis of ˆL. Therefore since Sp(V, ω) acts
transitively on the set of all symplectic bases of (V, ω), the proposition follows.
Let L be an arbitrary Lagrangian subspace of a symplectic space (V, ω), we denote
the stabilizer of L in Sp(V, ω) by S(L).
Proposition 1.5.4 Let L and ˆL be two arbitrary mutual Lagrangian complementary
Lagrangian subspaces of (V, ω). Then the map from S(L) into Gl(L) deﬁned by
s −→s|L induces an isomorphism from S(L) ∩S( ˆL) onto Gl(L).
Proof In fact, choose a symplectic basis of (V, ω) such that e1, . . . , en form a basis
of L and en+1, . . . , e2n form a basis of ˆL. Then by the relations in (1.5.1), the set
S(L) ∩S( ˆL) contains those elements in Gl(V ) such that with respect to the basis
(e1, . . . , e2n), their matrices have the form
A
0
0
t A−1
	
,
where A ∈Gl(n, k) is the matrix of the restriction s|L of s on L. Thus the proposition
holds.
□
Corollary 1.5.5 Let S(L)0 be the kernel of the homomorphism s −→s|L from S(L)
to Gl(L). Then the group S(L) is the semi-direct product of the normal subgroup
S(L)0 and the subgroup S(L) ∩S( ˆL), and the group S(L)0 acts simply transitively
on the set of all Lagrangian complementary subspaces of L in (V, ω).
Next, we determine the structure of S(L)0. Let q be the canonical map from V
onto V/L, and let B(V/L) be the space of the symmetric bilinear forms on V/L.
Since the rank of ω is equal to the dimension of V , thus for any b ∈B(V/L), there
exists a unique endomorphism ˜b of V such that
ω(˜b(x), y) = b(q(x), q(y))
(1.5.2)
holds for arbitrary x, y ∈V .

Some Algebra Basics
Proposition 1.5.6 The map b −→idV + ˜b is an isomorphism from the additive
group B(V/L) onto the subgroup S(L)0 of Sp(V, ω).
Proof For any b ∈B(V/L), we have ˜b(L) = {0}, where ˜b is deﬁned by (1.5.2).
Also since ˜b(V ) ⊂L⊥= L, thus ˜b1 ˜b2 = 0 for all b1, b2 ∈B(V/L). Thus the map
b −→idV + ˜b is a group homomorphism from the additive group B(V/L) into the
group Gl(V ). This map is injective. This is because q : V −→V/L is onto, so if
˜b = 0, then b = 0. For any b ∈B(V/L) and any x, y ∈V , since ω(˜b(x), ˜b(y)) = 0,
thus
ω(x + ˜b(x), y + ˜b(y)) = ω(x, y) + ω(˜b(x), y) + ω(x, ˜b(y))
= ω(x, y) + b(q(x), q(y)) −b(q(y), q(x))
= ω(x, y).
Thus idV + ˜b ∈Sp(V, ω). Since ˜b(L) = {0}, idV + ˜b ∈S(L)0, ∀b ∈B(V/L).
Now if s ∈S(L)0, we deﬁne a bilinear form on V by
(x, y) −→ω(s(x) −x, y) = ω(x, s−1(y) −y),
∀x, y ∈V.
If at least one of x, y belongs to L, then obviously (x, y) = 0. Thus for any y ∈V ,
we have
s(y) −y = s−1(s(y) −y) = y −s−1(y).
Therefore the bilinear form (x, y) −→ω(s(x) −x, y) is symmetric. Since its kernel
contains L, thus there exists b ∈B(V/L) such that
ω(s(x) −x, y) = b(q(x), q(y)),
∀x, y ∈V.
Thus s = idV + ˜b and the image of the homomorphism b −→idV + ˜b is S(L)0.
By Propositions 1.5.4 and 1.5.6, we obtain a canonical exact sequence
{0} −→B(V/L) −→S(L) −→Gl(L) −→(1).
From the discussions before, we also know that the group S(L) is isomorphic to
the linear group formed by all matrices of the form
A
B

,
where A ∈Gl(n, k), and B is an n × n symmetric matrix. This matrix linear group
is a linear group of dimension n2 + n(n+1)

.
Let (V, ω) be a symplectic space. Then the set of all Lagrangian subspaces of
(V, ω) is a submanifold of the Grassmann manifold of the n-dimensional planes
of V (assume that dim V = 2n), we denote it by L (V , ω). If L is a Lagrangian

1.5 Symplectic Groups
15
subspace of (V, ω), then the set of all Lagrangian complementary subspaces of L
is a Zariski open subset of L (V , ω). By the Corollary of Proposition 1.5.4 and
Proposition 1.5.6, there exists an afﬁne space structure on this open subset, its afﬁne
transformation group is isomorphic to B(V/L). Since the dimension of B(V, L) is
n(n+1)
2
, so L (V , ω) is an n(n+1)
2
dimensional manifold. While the group Sp(V, ω)
is a
dim L (V , ω) + dim S(L) = n(n + 1) + n2 = 2n2 + n
dimensional linear algebraic group.
Let (V, ω) be a symplectic space. We denote by sp(V, ω) the subspace of the
endomorphism space gl(V ) of V formed by all α such that
ω(α(x), y) + ω(x, α(y)) = 0,
∀x, y ∈V.
Proposition 1.5.7 The map
α −→(idV −α)(idV + α)−1
is a bijection from the subset of sp(V, ω) formed by all elements α such that idV + α
is invertible to the subset of Sp(V, ω) formed by all elements s such that idV + s is
invertible.
Proof Let idV = I, then for any α ∈sp(V, ω), the identity
ω((I + α)(x), (I + α)(y)) = ω((I −α)(x), (I −α)(y))
holds for all x, y ∈V . Thus, if I + α is invertible, then the identity
ω((I −α)(I + α)−1(x), (I −α)(I + α)−1(y)) = ω(x, y)
holds for all x, y ∈V . Hence
s = (I −α)(I + α)−1 ∈Sp(V, ω).
Also, since
I + s = (I + α)(I + α)−1 + (I −α)(I + α)−1 = 2(I + α)−1,
so I + s is invertible.
Conversely, if s ∈Sp(V, ω) such that I + s is invertible, let
α = (I + s)−1(I −s),
then for all x, y ∈V ,

Some Algebra Basics
ω(α(x), y) + ω(x, α(y))
= −2ω(x, y) + 2ω((I + s)−1(x), y) + 2ω(x, (I + s)−1(y)).
Let
x1 = (I + s)−1x,
y1 = (I + s)−1y,
then the previous formula implies
ω(α(x), y) + ω(x, α(y))
= −2ω((I + s)(x1), (I + s)(y1)) + 2ω(x1, (I + s)(y1)) + 2ω((I + s)(x1), y1)
= 0.
Thus α = (I + s)−1(I −s) ∈sp(V, ω). Also, since
I + α = (I + s)−1(I + s) + (I + s)−1(I −s) = 2(I + s)−1,
so I + α is invertible, and s = (I −α)(I + α)−1. Hence the map s −→(I +
s)−1(I −s) is the inverse of the map α −→(I −α)(I + α)−1.
□
The bijection α −→(I −α)(I + α)−1 in Proposition 1.5.7 is called the Cayley
parametrization (see Ref.[30]).
Remark 1.5.8 If α, β ∈sp(V, ω), then
[α, β] = αβ −βα ∈sp(V, ω).
If a bracket operation on sp(V, ω) is deﬁned by the above formula, then sp(V, ω)
becomes the Lie algebra of Sp(V, ω). If k = R or k = C, then the exponential map
α −→exp α maps sp(V, ω) into Sp(V, ω) (see Ref.[12]).
1.6
Symplectic Complex Structures
In this section, (V, ω) is assumed to be a 2n-dimensional symplectic space over R.
Since V is an even dimensional vector space, complex structures exist on V , that is,
there exist endomorphisms j of V such that j2 = −idV . If j is a complex structure
of V and j ∈Sp(V, ω), then we call j a symplectic complex structure. Thus, if j
is a symplectic complex structure, then for any x, y ∈V ,
ω( j(x), j(y)) = ω(x, y),
and
ω(x, j(y)) = ω( j(x), −y) = ω(y, j(x)).

1.6 Symplectic Complex Structures
17
Thus
(x, y) = ω(x, j(y)),
∀x, y ∈V,
is a symmetric bilinear form on V . It is obvious that this bilinear form is non-
degenerate. For λ + iμ ∈C, where λ, μ ∈R, and x ∈V , if V is deﬁned as a vector
space over C by
(λ + iμ)x = λx + μj(x),
then the complex valued real linear form
h(x, y) = ω(x, j(y)) −iω(x, y),
x, y ∈V,
is a pseudo-Hermitian form on V . In fact, for all x, y ∈V , we have the following
equalities:
h(x, y) = h(y, x),
h(ix, y) = h( j(x), y) = ω( j(x), j(y)) −iω( j(x), y)
= ω(x, y) + iω(x, j(y)) = ih(x, y).
Deﬁnition 1.6.1 A complex structure j on a symplectic space (V, ω) is called suit-
able, if it is symplectic and the symmetric bilinear form (x, y) = ω(x, j(y)) deﬁned
by j is positive deﬁnite.
According to this deﬁnition, a complex structure j is a suitable complex structure
is equivalent to that the form
(x, y) −→h(x, y) = ω(x, j(y)) −iω(x, y)
is a Hermitian form.
Proposition 1.6.2 Let (e1, . . . , e2n) be a symplectic basis of a symplectic space
(V, ω), and let j be a complex structure on V such that for any 1 ≤i ≤n, j(ei) =
en+i. Then j is a suitable complex structure. Conversely, if j is a suitable complex
structure, then there exists a symplectic basis (e1, . . . , e2n) of V such that j(ei) =
en+i, 1 ≤i ≤n.
Proof In fact, if j(ei) = en+i, 1 ≤i ≤n, then we have j(en+i) = −ei, therefore the
matrix of j with respect to the basis (e1, . . . , e2n) is
−J2n =

.
Thus by Sect.1.4, j is symplectic. Also, with respect to the basis (e1, . . . , e2n),
the matrix of the symmetric bilinear form ω(x, j(y)) is −(J2n)2 = I2n, thus it is
positive deﬁnite. That is, j is a suitable complex structure. Conversely, let j be a

suitable complex structure on (V, ω). Let L be a Lagrangian subspace of (V, ω),
let (e1, . . . , en) be a basis of L such that it is an orthonormal basis with respect to
the bilinear form (x, y) −→ω(x, j(y)), and let en+i = j(ei), i = 1, . . . , n. Then
(e1, . . . , e2n) is a symplectic basis of (V, ω).
□
Proposition 1.6.3 Let j be a suitable complex structure on (V, ω), then we have:
(1) For any Lagrangian subspace L of (V, ω), j(L) is a complementary Lagrangian
subspace of L.
(2) Any complex subspace of V (that is, a subspace invariant under the action of j)
is a symplectic space.
Proof Since j ∈Sp(V, ω), j(L) is a Lagrangian subspace. If x, y ∈L, then we have
ω(x, j( j(y))) = −ω(x, y) = 0,
thus j(L) is orthogonal to L with respect to the bilinear form (x, y) −→ω(x, j(y)).
Since this bilinear form is positive deﬁnite, we have L ∩j(L) = {0}, thus j(L) is a
complementary Lagrangian subspace of L, and (1) is proved. Now if E is a complex
subspace of V and x ∈E ∩E⊥, then since j(x) ∈E, ω(x, j(x)) = 0, and therefore
x = 0. Thus E ∩E⊥= {0}. That is, E is a symplectic subspace.
□
Lemma 1.6.4 Let j be a symplectic complex structure on a symplectic space (V, ω)
and let s ∈Gl(V ). The following conditions are equivalent:
(1) s ◦j = j ◦s and ω(s(x), s(y)) = ω(x, y) for all x, y ∈V ,
(2) s ◦j = j ◦s and ω(x, j(y)) = ω(s(x), j(s(y))) for all x, y ∈V ,
(3) ω(s(x), s(y)) = ω(x, y) and ω(s(x), j(s(y))) = ω(x, j(y)) for all x, y ∈V .
Proof It is obvious that (1) implies (2) and (2) implies (3). If (3) holds, then
ω(s(x), s( j(y)) −j(s(y))) = 0
holds for all x, y ∈V . Thus s ◦j = j ◦s and (3) implies (1).
Condition (1) of Lemma 1.6.4 amounts to say that s ∈GlC ∩Sp(V, ω), condition
(2) amounts to say that s ∈GlC ∩O(V, b), where O(V, b) denotes the orthogonal
transformation group of V with respect to the bilinear form b(x, y) = ω(x, j(y)),
and (3) amounts to say that s keeps the Hermitian form h = b −iω invariant.
If (V, ω) is the canonical symplectic space (R2n, ω), and j is the complex structure
deﬁned by −J2n, then b is the canonical Euclidean bilinear form
b(ei, e j) = δi j,
i, j = 1, . . . , 2n,
and h is the canonical Hermitian form
h(ei, e j) = δi j,
, i, j = 1, . . . , n.
Thus, we have the following proposition.

1.6 Symplectic Complex Structures

Proposition 1.6.5 We have
Sp(2n) ∩Gl(n, C) = O(2n) ∩Gl(n, C) = U(n),
where O(2n) denotes the orthogonal group, and U(n) denotes the unitary group.
Corollary 1.6.6 The unitary group U(n) is a maximal compact subgroup of Sp(2n).
Proof Let G be a compact subgroup of Sp(2n) and assume that G ⊃U(n). Let b
be the canonical Euclidean bilinear form on R2n. Since G is compact, there exists a
positive deﬁnite symmetric bilinear form ˜b on R2n that is invariant under the action
of G (see Ref.[5]). It is not hard to see that it is possible to choose λ ∈R such that the
rank of b −λ˜b < 2n. Since U(n) ⊂O(2n), thus the kernel of b −λ˜b is a nonzero
invariant subspace of U(n). Also, since U(n) acts transitively on the set of unitary
vectors, so ker(b −λ˜b) = R2n, that is b = λ˜b and G ⊂Sp(2n) ∩O(2n) = U(n).
Thus G = U(n).

Chapter 2
Symplectic Manifolds
In this chapter and the chapters that follow, “differentiable” means C∞-differentiable,
“manifold” means C∞-differentiable real manifold, “differential form” and “vector
ﬁeld” mean exterior differential form and C∞vector ﬁeld, respectively.
Let M be a manifold. We denote by p(M) the vector space of differential p-
forms on M and by (M) the graded algebra 
p≥0 p(M).
For each vector ﬁeld X on M, we can deﬁne two important operators on (M): the
inner product through X, denoted by i(X), and the Lie derivation θ(X).The deﬁnition
of i(X) can be found in Chap.1, and θ(X) can be deﬁned by the formula
θ(X) = d ◦i(X) + i(X) ◦d,
where d is the exterior derivation of (M). We have the following relations between
i(X) and θ(X) (see Ref.[12]):
θ([X, Y]) = θ(X) ◦θ(Y) −θ(Y) ◦θ(X),
i([X, Y]) = θ(X) ◦i(Y) −i(Y) ◦θ(X),
i(X) ◦i(Y) + i(Y) ◦i(X) = 0,
where X and Y are vector ﬁelds on M. By the deﬁnition, the Lie derivation θ(X) is
a degree 0 derivation of the graded algebra (M), and the inner product i(X) is a
degree −1 Z2-derivation.
Let N be a submanifold of M and let α ∈p(M). We denote the pullback of α
in p(N) by α|N.

1. for any x ∈M, ωx is a symplectic structure on the tangent space Tx M at the point
x, and
2. d ω = 0,
then we call ω a symplectic structure on the manifold M, and call (M, ω) a symplectic
manifold.
Let (M1, ω1) and (M2, ω2) be two symplectic manifolds, and let ϕ : M1 −→M2
be a differentiable map. If ϕ satisﬁes the condition
ω1 = ϕ∗(ω2),
(2.1.1)
then we call ϕ a symplectic manifold homomorphism from (M1, ω1) to (M2, ω2). A
symplectic manifold isomorphism from (M1, ω1) to (M2, ω2) is a diffeomorphism
from M1 onto M2 that satisﬁes (2.1.1).
If ϕ : (M1, ω1) −→(M2, ω2) is a symplectic manifold homomorphism, then for
any x ∈M1, the derivative of ϕ at the point x is a homomorphism between symplectic
vector spaces:
ϕT
x : (Tx M1, (ω1)x) −→(Tϕ(x)M2, (ω2)ϕ(x)).
Thus, all symplectic manifold homomorphisms are immersion maps.
2.1.1 Basic properties. Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold. Then we have:
1. The dimension of M is an even number.
2. M is orientable. If dim M = 2n, then the nth exterior power ωn is a volume
element on M.
3. If v ∈Tx(M), then i(v)ωx ∈T ∗

T ∗M can be deﬁned. Similarly, the map that sends a vector ﬁeld X on M to a
1-form i(X)ω is a canonical isomorphism from the module of vector ﬁelds onto
the module of 1-forms.
4. The ﬁber bundle of all order 1 coordinate frames on M contains a subbundle
determined by the structure group Sp(2n), which is formed by the symplectic
coordinate frames. Here, a symplectic coordinate frame means a coordinate frame
ξ : R2n −→Tx M such that A(ξ)ωx = ω, where ω is the canonical symplectic
form on R2n (see Sect.1.2).
5. If M is a compact manifold, then for i = 0, 1, . . . , n, the cohomology spaces (de
Rham) H 2i(M, R) are all nonzero. In fact, the form ωi corresponds to the coho-
mology class [ωi] = [ω]i ∈H 2i(M, R). Since ωn is a volume element, [ωn] ̸= 0,
thus [ωi] ̸= 0. Therefore there does not exist a symplectic structure on any sphere
of dimension ̸= 2. We can deﬁne a symplectic structure on the projective space
C P1, which is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional sphere.

Remark 2.1.3 Let (M, ω) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold. Then for any
0 ̸= λ ∈R, λω is a symplectic structure on M. If M is compact and |λ| ̸= 1, then the
symplectic manifold (M, ω) is not isomorphic to the symplectic manifold (M, λω),

Examples 2.1.4
1. Let x1, . . . , x2n be the natural coordinates on R2n, then the 2-form
ω =
n

i=1
d xi ∧d xn+i
is a symplectic structure on the manifold R2n. We call this symplectic structure the
canonical symplectic structure on R2n.
2. Let G be the group formed by the afﬁne transformations of R2n such that their
linear parts belong to Sp(2n). Then G contains the parallel translations, and it is the
transitive automorphism group of the symplectic manifold (R2n, ω). If 	 is a discrete
subgroup of G, and it acts on R2n freely, then R2n\	 is a manifold, and there exists a
unique symplectic structure on R2n\	 such that the canonical map R2n −→R2n\	
is a symplectic manifold homomorphism. If 	 is the integer parallel translation group
Z2n, then a symplectic structure can be deﬁned on the torus R2n\Z2n such that it is
invariant under the natural action of R2n on R2n\Z2n.
3. Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold, and let π : 
M −→M be a covering of M.
Then ( 
M, π∗(ω)) is a symplectic manifold and π is a symplectic manifold homo-
morphism.
4. Let (M1, ω1) and (M2, ω2) be two symplectic manifolds, and let
pri : M1 × M2 −→Mi,
i = 1, 2,
be the canonical projections. Then pr∗
1(ω1) + pr∗
2(ω2) is a symplectic structure
on M1 × M2. We call the symplectic manifold (M1 × M2, pr∗
1(ω1) + pr∗
2(ω2))
the product of the symplectic manifolds (M1, ω1) and (M2, ω2), and denote it by
(M1, ω1) × (M2, ω2).
2.1.5Kählerstructures.Let M bea2n-dimensionalmanifold,andlet J beacomplex
structure on M. As a tensor on M, J is of type (1, 1), thus we can view it as an
endomorphism of the module of the vector ﬁelds on M. Then J satisﬁes the following
conditions:
(1) J 2 = −id, and
(2) J[X, Y] = [J X, Y] + [X, JY] + J[J X, JY],
where X and Y are two arbitrary vector ﬁelds on M.
Let g be a differential symmetric 2-form on M such that g(J X, JY) = g(X, Y)
holds for all vector ﬁelds X, Y on M. Let ω(X, Y) = g(J X, Y), then ω ∈2(M).

Symplectic Manifolds
If the rank of g is equal to 2n at every point of M, that is, g is a pseudo Riemannian
form, then for any x ∈M, ωx is a symplectic form on the vector space Tx M and Jx
is a symplectic complex structure on (Tx M, ωx). The form h = g −iω is a pseudo
Hermitian form on M. If in addition d ω = 0, then ω is a symplectic structure on M,
and h is called a pseudo Kähler form. Finally, if d ω = 0 and g is positive deﬁnite
on the tangent space at every point on M, then h is called a Kähler form on M. If h is
a Kähler form, then for any x ∈M, Jx is a suitable complex structure on (Tx M, ωx).
If h is a Kähler form on a complex manifold M, then for any complex submanifold
N of M, the pullback of h on N is a Kähler form on N. In particular, all complex
submanifolds of M are equipped with induced symplectic structures.
Example 2.1.6 Let CPn be the complex projective space formed by all complex
lines in Cn+1. The tangent space at any point D ∈CPn can be identiﬁed with the
complex linear map space LC(D, Cn+1/D). If η is the canonical Hermitian form on
Cn+1, that is η = n+1
i=1 zizi, where z1, . . . , zn+1 are the natural coordinates on Cn+1,
let D⊥be the hyperplane that orthogonal to D with respect to η, then the tangent
space at D can be identiﬁed with the complex vector space LC(D, D⊥). Thus, for
any D ∈CPn, we can deﬁne a Hermitian form on TDCPn as follows:
ηD(ϕ, ψ) = η(ϕ(u), ψ(u))
η(u, u)
,
where ϕ, ψ ∈LC(D, D⊥), u ∈D\{0}. Let p be the canonical map from U =
Cn+1\{0} onto CPn given by u −→Cu. Identify the tangent bundle TU with
U × Cn+1 by using the following equality:
(u, v) = d
d t (u + tv)|t=0,
u ∈U, v ∈Cn+1.
Then for any (u, v) ∈TuU, we can deﬁne a vector pT (u, v) in LC(Cu, (Cu)⊥) such
that
(pT (u, v))(u) = v −η(v, u)
η(u, u)u.
Then for (u, v), (u, w) ∈TuU we have
ηCu(pT (u, v), pT (u, w)) = η(u, u)η(v, w) −η(v, u)η(u, w)
η(u, u)2
,
which is the value of the Hermitian form ˜η on U deﬁned by
˜η =

evaluated at the vector pair (u, v), (u, w). Thus, for any D ∈CPn, ηD is always the
value of a Hermitian form η on CPn that satisﬁes p∗(η) = ˜η at the point D. Denote
the imaginary part of η by ω, then p∗(ω) is the imaginary part of ˜η. Let z j = x j + iy j,
then p∗(ω) is equal to

d x j ∧d y j + 1

d r
r2 ∧

j
(x j d y j −y j d x j),
where r = 
j z jz j. Direct computation shows that p∗(ω) is a closed 2-form. Thus
p∗(d ω) = d (p∗(ω)) = 0.
Since p is also an immersion, d ω = 0. This proves that η is a Kähler form and ω is
a symplectic structure on CPn.
Theactionof theunitarygroupU(n + 1) onCPn is transitiveandkeeps theKähler
form η invariant. Let D ∈CPn and let rD ∈U(n + 1) be the reﬂection determined
by the following condition:
rD(x) =

−x,
x ∈D,
x,
x ∈D⊥.
Then the action of rD on CPn ﬁxes D, and for any ϕ ∈TDCPn, (rD)T ϕ = −ϕ. Thus
it is a “symmetry” centered at the point D. Thus for any differential p-form α on
CPn,
(r∗
D(α))D = (−1)pαD.
If p is an odd integer and α is invariant under U(n + 1), then
αD = (r∗
D(α))D = −αD
holds for all D ∈CPn. Thus α = 0. This implies that the U(n + 1) invariant differ-
ential forms on CPn are either even degrees or 0, and thus all are closed. Since η
is a U(n + 1) invariant differential form, this also provides a different proof for the
fact that the imaginary part of η is a closed form. It can be proved that all invariant
differential forms on a homogeneous symmetric space are closed by using the same
method (see Ref.[12]).
Remark 2.1.7 There exist compact symplectic manifolds that do not have a Kähler
structure, a 4-dimensional example was given by Thurston. The construction method
is similar to that of 2.1.4 Example 2 (see Ref.[29]).

Symplectic Manifolds
2.2
Operators of the Algebra of Differential Forms
on a Symplectic Manifold
Let (M, ω) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold. From the deﬁnition of a sym-
plectic manifold, for any x ∈M, (Tx(M), ωx) is a symplectic space. Let x(M) be
the algebra of the skew-symmetric forms on the vector space Tx M. As described in
Sect.1.3, there exists a canonical linear representation of the Lie algebra sl(2, R) on
every x(M), which can be obtained by restricting a canonical linear representation
of sl(2, R) on (M) to x(M). We deﬁne this canonical representation of sl(2, R)
on (M) next.
First, deﬁne an endomorphism X of (M) by
X(β) = ω ∧β,
∀β ∈(M).
Second, deﬁne an endomorphism H of (M) by
H(β) = (p −n)β,
∀β ∈p(M).
Let x ∈M and let (e1, . . . , e2n) be a symplectic basis of (Tx(M), ωx). Deﬁne an
endomorphism Y of (M) such that
(Y(β))x =
n

j=1
i(e j) i(en+ j)βx,
∀β ∈(M).
Locally, Y can be expressed as
Y = 1
2
2n

j=1
i(E j) i(E′
j),
where E1, . . . , E2n and E′
1, . . . , E′
2n are two collections of vector ﬁelds satisfying
ω(Ei, E′
j) = δi j.
View (M) as a module over 0(M) = C∞(M). Then it is easy to see that the
operators X, H, Y are module endomorphism of (M). Note that this situation has
been discussed in Sect.1.3, and thus we have
[H, X] = H ◦X −X ◦H = 2X,
[H, Y] = H ◦Y −Y ◦H = −2Y,
[X, Y] = X ◦Y −Y ◦X = −H.
(2.2.1)
Thus the operators X, H, Y deﬁne a canonical linear representation of the Lie algebra
sl(2, R) on (M). This representation is important in the study of manifolds, in
particularly in the study of Kähler manifolds (see Ref.[27]).

2.2 Operators of the Algebra of Differential Forms on a Symplectic Manifold
27
Now let ω be an exact form, that is, there is a 1-form α on M such that d α = −ω.
We call the endomorphism of (M): β −→α ∧β, ∀β ∈(M), the left exterior
product deﬁned by α, and denote it by μ(α). Using α, we deﬁne two new operators
P and Q on (M) as follows:
P = d −μ(α)
Q = [Y, P].
(2.2.2)
The operators P and Q are both order one differential operators. For example, for
any f ∈C∞(M) and any β ∈(M), we have
P( fβ) = f P(β) + d f ∧β.
Also, P and Q are degree 1 and degree −1, respectively, derivations, that is
P(p(M)) ⊂p+1(M),
Q(p(M)) ⊂p−1(M).
(2.2.3)
Proposition 2.2.1 The operators X, Y, H, P and Q satisfy the following relations:
(1) [H, P] = P,
[H, Q] = −Q;
(2) [X, P] = 0,
[X, Q] = −P;
(3) [Y, P] = Q,
[Y, Q] = 0;
(4) P2 = X,
Q2 = Y,
P ◦Q + Q ◦P = H.
Proof The formulas in (1) can be derived from (2.2.3) directly. Now we prove (2).
Since d ω = 0, thus [d, X] = 0, and thus by (2.2.2) and the deﬁnition of α, [X, P] =
0. According to the deﬁnition, Q = [Y, P], so we have
[X, Q] = [X, [Y, P]] = [[X, Y], P] + [Y, [X, P]] = −[H, P] = −P.
Thus (2) is proved. Also since d α = −ω, we have
d ◦μ(α) + μ(α) ◦d = −X,
thus
P2 = (d −μ(α))2 = X.
Since Q = [Y, P], so
P ◦Q + Q ◦P = P ◦Y ◦P −P2 ◦Y + Y ◦P2 −P ◦Y ◦P
= [Y, X] = H.
Now it remains to prove that [Y, Q] = 0 and Q2 = Y. Let
a = RX + RY + RH

Symplectic Manifolds
be the subalgebra of the endomorphism Lie algebra gl((M)) of the space (M)
generated by X, Y, H, then a is isomorphic to sl(2, R). Let ε be the subspace of
gl((M)) spanned by the following elements:
P, ad(Y)P, . . . , ad(Y)r P, . . . ,
where ad is the adjoint representation of gl((M)) (that is, ad(U)V = [U, V ], U,
V ∈gl((M))). Since ad(Y)r = 0 for integers r > n, the space ε is ﬁnite dimen-
sional. Since for all r ≥0,
ad(H) ad(Y)r P = (2r + 1) ad(Y)r P,
thus ε is invariant under the actions of both ad(Y) and ad(H). Since
ad(X) ad(Y)r −ad(Y)r ad(X) = r(1 −r) ad(Y)r−1 −r · ad(H) ad(Y)r−1,
so ε is also invariant under ad(X). Since ad(X)P = 0 and ad(H)P = P, so P is a
weight 1 primitive element for the restriction of the adjoint representation ad of a to
ε. We know that (see Refs.[13] or [31]), if this is the case, then ad(Y)2P = 0, and
thus
[Y, Q] = ad(Y)Q = ad(Y)2P = 0.
Write Q2 differently as
Q2 = Q ◦Y ◦P −Q ◦P ◦Y = Y ◦Q ◦P −Q ◦P ◦Y,
and as
Q2 = Y ◦P ◦Q −P ◦Y ◦Q = Y ◦P ◦Q −P ◦Q ◦Y,
then from what we have proved, we get 2Q2 = [Y, H] = 2Y.
□
By using the concept of “Lie superalgebras”, the relations in Proposition 2.2.1
can be well described in “Lie superalgebra” language. Next, we will deﬁne Lie
superalgeras and provide some examples.
Deﬁnition 2.2.2 (See Ref.[14]). A Lie superalgebra over a ﬁeld k is a Z2-graded
vector space g = g0 + g1 over k, together with a bilinear map (called a bracket)
[ , ] : g × g −→g
such that the following (1)–(3) hold:
(1) [gp, gq] ⊂gp+q, p, q ∈Z2,
(2) [x, y] = −(−1)p·q[y, x], ∀x ∈gp, y ∈gq,
(3) [x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] + (−1)p·q[y, [x, z]], ∀x ∈gp, y ∈gq, z ∈g.

2.2 Operators of the Algebra of Differential Forms on a Symplectic Manifold

Examples 2.2.3
1. Let V = 
p∈Z Vp be a Z-graded vector space. Denote by gl(V )r the set of all
elements α in gl(V ) such that α(Vp) ⊂Vp+r. Deﬁne a bracket on the Z-graded space
gl(V )∗= 
r∈Z gl(V )r by
[α, β] = α ◦β −(−1)pqβ ◦α,
∀α ∈gl(V )p, β ∈gl(V )q.
With this bracket, if a new gradation is deﬁned by regrading the original gradation
in Z according to modulo 2 congruence classes, then the space gl(V )∗becomes a
Lie superalgebra.
2. Let A = 
p∈Z Ap be a Z-graded associative algebra (Ap Aq ⊂Ap+q), and let
gl(A)p be deﬁned as in Example 1. If α ∈gl(A)p and
α(xy) = α(x)y + (−1)prxα(y),
∀x ∈Ar, y ∈A,
then we call α a Z2-derivation of A. Let Der(A)p be the subspace formed by all
Z2-derivations in gl(A)p, then
Der(A)∗=

p∈Z
Der(A)p
is a Lie supersubalgebra of gl(A)∗, that is, it is a graded subspace that is invariant
under the bracket of gl(A)∗.
3. Let (e−1, e0, e1) be the natural basis of R3. Deﬁne a Z-gradation on R3 as follows:
the grading of ep = p,
p = −1, 0, 1.
Let b be a bilinear form on R3 such that with respect to the basis (e−1, e0, e1), it has
the matrix
⎛
⎝
0 0 1
0 1 0
−1 0 0
⎞
⎠.
Then the restriction of b on Re−1 + Re1 is a symplectic form, while its restriction
on Re0 is a positive deﬁnite symmetric form (b is called an orthogonal symplectic
form). Let osp(2, 1) be the Z-graded subspace of gl(3, R) = gl(R3)∗such that its
elements of grading p are those elements α ∈gl(3, R)p satisfying
b(α(x), y) + (−1)prb(x, α(y)) = 0,
∀x ∈Rer, y ∈R3.
Then osp(2, 1) is a Lie super subalgebra of gl(3, R) (cf. Example 1). It is of 5-
dimensional, and it has a basis given by the following elements:

⎠.
The Z-gradings of the elements X, P, H, Q, Y are, respectively, 2, 1, 0, −1,
−2. The subspace of osp(2, 1) spanned by the even degree elements is a subalgebra
isomorphic to sl(2, R).
Now let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold, and let X, H, Y, P, Q be the operators
on (M) deﬁned by using an α satisfying d α = −ω as in the beginning of this
section. Then it is not hard to prove (the reader can prove this as an exercise), that
the map ρ from osp(2, 1) into gl((M)) deﬁned by
ρ(X) = X,
ρ(H) = H,
ρ(Y) = Y,
ρ(P) = P,
ρ(Q) = Q,
is a Lie superalgebra homomorphism. Thus a choice of α determines a linear rep-
resentation of osp(2, 1) on the graded space (M).
The Lie superalgebra osp(2, 1) is rather similar to sl(2, R) (see Refs.[14, 21]).
For example, osp(2, 1) is a simple algebra, that is, it does not contain any ideal sub-
algebra other than {0} and itself. All ﬁnite dimensional representations of osp(2, 1)
are semisimple (i.e. completely reducible). For any integer n ≥0, there exists a
unique 2n + 1-dimensional simple linear representation (irreducible linear repre-
sentation). Corresponding to this representation, the weights of H are all integers
in the interval [−n, n]. If n > 0, then the representation decomposes into the direct
sum of two simple representations of dimensions n and n + 1, respectively, of the
subaglebra sl(2, R) ⊂osp(2, 1). Finally, we point out that the dimensions of all
ﬁnite dimensional simple representations of osp(2, 1) are odd numbers.
2.3
Symplectic Coordinates
By using a theorem of Darboux, the following conclusion can be made: two symplec-
tic manifolds with the same dimension is locally isomorphic. In this section, we use
induction on the dimension to give a proof for this conclusion. Moser (see Ref.[29])

2.3 Symplectic Coordinates

pointed out an alternative proof1 by using transformation, we will describe his result
in Sect.2.6.
Let M be a manifold, and let α be an arbitrary p-form on M. Consider the elements
v of the tangent bundle T M that satisfy the condition: if v ∈Tx M, then i(v)αx = 0.
The set of these v is called the kernel of α, and is denoted by ker α. If ker α is a
sub-vector bundle of T M with the dimensions of the ﬁbers equal to dim M −r, then
α is said to have constant rank r.
Lemma 2.3.1 Let M be a manifold, let ϕ : M −→Rs be a submersion, and let
α ∈p(M). If ker ϕT ⊂(ker α) ∩(ker d α), then for any point x0 of M, there exists
an open neighborhood U of x0 and a form β in (ϕ(U)), such that α|U = ϕ∗(β).
Proof Let n = dim M, let y1, . . . , ys be the natural coordinates of Rs, and let xi =
yi ◦ϕ. Since ϕ is a submersion, there exist an open neighborhood V of x0 in M
and differentiable functions xs+1, . . . , xn on V , such that x1, . . . , xn is a coordinate
system on V . For any i = s + 1, . . . , n, the vector ﬁeld
∂
∂xi is a cross section of the
ﬁber bundle ker ϕT on V . Let S(p, n) be the set of all maps τ: [1, p] −→[1, n]
such that
τ(1) < τ(2) < · · · < τ(p),
and let the coordinate expression of α|V be
α|V =

τ∈S(p,n)
fτdxτ(1) ∧· · · ∧d xτ(p).
Since for j > s, i

∂
∂x j
	
α = 0, so if τ(p) > s, then fτ = 0. Therefore,
α|V =

τ∈S(p,s)
fτ d xτ(1) ∧· · · ∧d xτ(p).
Also for j > s, i

∂
∂x j
	
d α = 0, so for all j > s,
∂
∂x j fτ = 0. Thus, there exists an
open neighborhood of x0, say U, such that in this neighborhood, the function fτ has
the form fτ = ϕ∗(gτ), where gτ is a differentiable function on ϕ(U). Let
β =

τ∈S(p,s)
gτ d yτ(1) ∧· · · ∧d yτ(p),
then we have α|U = ϕ∗(β).

1Added by the authors of the Forewords. Originally, Moser introduced his method for manifolds
endowed with a volume form. The use of this method for a proof of Darboux’ theorem is due to
the French mathematician Jean Martinet (Sur les singularités de formes différentielles, thèse de
doctorat d’État, Grenoble, 1969, and Ann. Inst. Fourier Grenoble, 20, 1970, 95–178). Symplectic
coordinates are often called canonical coordinates or Darboux coordinates in other texts.

Symplectic Manifolds
Proposition 2.3.2 Let M and N be two manifolds, and let ϕ : M −→N be an onto
submersion. If the ﬁbers of ϕ are connected and α is a differential form on M such
that ker ϕT = (ker α) ∩(ker d α), then there exists a unique differential form β on
N such that α = ϕ∗(β).
Proof According to Lemma 2.3.1, for any x ∈M, there exists an open neighborhood
Ux of x and a differential form βx on ϕ(Ux) such that α|Ux = ϕ∗(βx). Consider βx
as a cross section of the ﬁber bundle on the space N, then for arbitrary x, y ∈
M, we have βx = βy on ϕ(Ux ∩Uy). Also since the ﬁbers of ϕ are connected,
βx = βy on ϕ(Ux) ∩ϕ(Uy). Thus there exists a differential form β on ϕ(M) = N
such that the equation βx = β|ϕ(Ux) holds for all x ∈M. Then α = ϕ∗(β). Also,
since ϕT : T M −→T N is an onto map, β is uniquely determined by the required
equation.

Let M be a manifold. A sub-vector bundle E of the vector bundle T M is called
integrable if: (1) it is a differentiable manifold, and (2) for arbitrary differentiable
cross sections X, Y on E, [X, Y] = X ◦Y −Y ◦X is also a cross section of E.
For example, if ϕ : M −→N is a constant rank differentiable map, then the sub-
ﬁber bundle ker ϕT ⊂T M is integrable.
The Frobenius theorem described below shows, locally, all integrable sub-bundles
of T M can be obtained by using the same method of the above example. The reader
can ﬁnd the proof of this theorem in any book about manifolds.
Theorem 2.3.3 (Frobenius’ theorem) Let M be a manifold, and let E be an inte-
grable sub-bundle of T M. Let the dimension of the ﬁbers of E be r, and let the
dimensions of the ﬁbers of T M be n. Then locally, there exist coordinates x1, . . . , xn
on M such that
E =

r<i≤n
ker d xi.
Thus, for these local coordinates,
∂
∂x1 , . . . ,
∂
∂xr form a basis for the cross sections of
E locally.
Corollary 2.3.4 Let M be a manifold, and let E be an integrable sub-bundle of
T M. Then for any x ∈M, there exists an open neighborhood U of x in M and a
submersion
ϕ : U −→Rn−r
such that ker ϕT = E ∩TU.
Proof This is an immediate consequence of Frobenius Theorem.
□
Proposition 2.3.5 Let M be a manifold, and let α ∈p(M) be a closed differential
p-form such that the rank of α is equal to r at every point of M. Then for any x ∈M,
there exist an open neighborhood U of x in M, a submersion ϕ : U −→Rr, and
a p-form β ∈p(ϕ(U)), such that α|U = ϕ∗(β). Furthermore, β is also a closed
form, and its rank at every point of ϕ(U) is also r.

Proof Since the rank of α is equal to r at every point of M, E = ker α is a sub-bundle
of T M, and the dimension of its ﬁbers is n −r, where n = dim M. Since E = kerα,
the differentiable cross sections on E are vector ﬁelds X on M satisfying i(X)α = 0.
If X and Y are two cross sections of E, then we have
i([X, Y])α = θ(X) i(Y)α + i(Y)θ(X)α
= i(Y)θ(X)α = i(Y)(d i(X)α + i(X) d α) = 0.
Thus [X, Y] is also a cross section of E and hence E is integrable. From the Corollary
of Frobenius Theorem, for any x ∈M, there exist an open neighborhood U0 of x
and a submersion ϕ : U0 −→Rr such that ker ϕT = E ∩TU0. Since
(ker α) ∩(ker d α) = ker α = E ⊃ker ϕT ,
according to Lemma 2.3.1, U0 contains an open neighborhood U of x and there is
β ∈p(ϕ(U)) such that α|U = ϕ∗(β). Also, since ϕ is a submersion and
ϕ∗(d β) = d ϕ∗(β) = d α = 0,
so we have d β = 0. Since ker β = ϕT (ker α|U) = 0, the rank of β is always r.

Corollary 2.3.6 Let α be a closed 2-form on a manifold M such that its rank is 2r
at every point of M. Then for any x ∈M, there exist an open neighborhood U of
x, a submersion ϕ : U −→R2r, and a symplectic structure ω on ϕ(U) such that
α|U = ϕ∗(ω).
Proof This is a direct application of Proposition 2.3.5.
□
Theorem 2.3.7 (Darboux theorem) Let M be a manifold, and let α be a closed 2-
form on M such that its rank is 2r at every point of M. Then for any x ∈M, there
exist an open neighborhood U and differentiable functions x1, . . . , x2r on U such
that
α|U = d x1 ∧d xr+1 + · · · + d xr ∧d x2r.
Proof We use induction on 2r ≤dim M. The statement obviously holds when 2r =
0. Next we divide the proof into two steps.
(1) Let 2r < dim M. According to the Corollary of Proposition 2.3.5, there exist a
neighborhoodU0 of x, a submersion ϕ : U0 −→R2r, and a symplectic structure ω on
ϕ(U0) such that α|U0 = ϕ∗(ω). Since dim ϕ(U0) = 2r < dim M, to use induction,
we can assume that the statement holds for 2r −2 and show that it also holds for 2r.
But since dim ϕ(U0) = 2r, there exist an open neighborhood V of y = ϕ(x) in R2r
and differentiable functions y1, . . . , y2r on V such that
ω|V = d y1 ∧d yr+1 + · · · + d yr ∧d y2r.
Let U = ϕ−1(V ) and let xi = yi ◦ϕ, 1 ≤i ≤2r. Then

34

Symplectic Manifolds
α|U = d x1 ∧d xr+1 + · · · + d xr ∧d x2r,
and we have proved the statement for all 2r < dim M.
(2) Let 2r = dim M. In this case, α is a symplectic structure on M, and the map
X −→i(X)α
is a module isomorphism from the module of vector ﬁelds on M onto the module
1(M). Thus for any differentiable function f on M, there exists a unique vector
ﬁeld H f on M such that i(H f )α = d f (we will investigate the map f −→H f in
detail in Sect.2.4). Let f be a differentiable function on some neighborhood of x
such that d fx ̸= 0, then H f ̸= 0 on some neighborhood of x. We can also ﬁnd a
differentiable function g on a sufﬁciently small neighborhood U0 of x such that
H f · g = 1 for every point on U0. Now let α′ = α −d f ∧d g. Then d α′ = 0 and
i(H f )α′ = d f −(i(H f ) i(H f )α) ∧d g −d f ∧(i(H f ) d g) = 0.
Thus the rank of α′ is <2r at every point of U0. On the other hand, the equality
αr = (α′)r + r(α′)r−1 ∧d f ∧d g = r(α′)r−1 ∧d f ∧d g
implies that (α′)r−1 ̸= 0 at every point of U0. Thus α′ is a form of constant rank
r −1 on U0. Thus by (1), there exist differentiable functions x1, . . . , xr−1 and
xr+1, . . . , x2r−1 on an open neighborhood U of x that is contained in U0 such that
α′ = d x1 ∧d xr+1 + · · · + d xr−1 ∧d x2r−1.
Then on U,
α = d x1 ∧d xr+1 + · · · + d xr ∧d x2r,
where xr = f, x2r = g.
□
Remark 2.3.8 Since the rank of α is equal to 2r at every point, the functions
x1, . . . , x2r are independent at every point of U.
Deﬁnition 2.3.9 Let (M, ω) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold, and let U
be an open subset of M. A coordinate system x1, . . . , x2n on U is called a symplectic
coordinate system if
ω|U = d x1 ∧d xn+1 + · · · + d xn ∧d x2n.
According to Darboux’s theorem, there exist local symplectic coordinates on a suit-
able neighborhood of every point of M. Let the dimension of M be 2n. We can view
an open set of R2n as a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold equipped with the pull-
back symplectic structure of the canonical symplectic structure on R2n. Therefore,
using a symplectic coordinate system on an open set U of M, an isomorphism from

2.3 Symplectic Coordinates
35
(U, ω|U) onto an open set of R2n can be deﬁned. The existence of local symplectic
coordinates also shows that two symplectic manifolds with the same dimension are
locally isomorphic.

Let X be a vector ﬁeld on a manifold M, let U be an open subset of M, and let I be an
open interval of R containing 0. If a differentiable map ϕ : I × U −→M satisﬁes
the following two conditions:
(1) ϕ(0, x) = x, ∀x ∈U, and
(2) for any x ∈U, the map : a −→ϕ(a, x), a ∈I, is an integral curve of X,
then we call ϕ a ﬂow generated by X.
Denote by t the projection R × M −→R, and consider the partial differentiation
operator
∂
∂t as a vector ﬁeld on the manifold R × M. Then condition (2) above is
equivalent to the requirement ϕT ◦∂
∂t = X ◦ϕ, which is equivalent to

For a ∈I, deﬁne an immersion
λa : x −→(a, x), x ∈U.
Then λa maps U into I × U, and ϕa = ϕ ◦λa deﬁnes a family of differentiable maps
from U into M depending on the parameter a ∈I. From the deﬁnition of ϕ, for every
a ∈I, ϕa is a diffeomorphism from U onto ϕa(U).
Lemma 2.4.1 Let α be a differential p-form on M, let X be a vector ﬁeld on M,
and let ϕ : I × U −→M be a ﬂow generated by X. Then the p-form ϕ∗
a(α) on U
does not depend on the parameter a ∈I if and only if θ(X)α = 0 on ϕ(I × U).
Proof The family formed by the differential forms ϕ∗
a(α), a ∈I, can be viewed as
the differential form on I × U deﬁned by

So if θ(X)α = 0, then ϕ∗
a(α) does not depend on a ∈I. Conversely, if ϕ∗
a(α) does
not depend on a, then according to the above computation, we have
ϕ∗θ(X)α = d t ∧r,

Thus for any a ∈I,
ϕ∗
aθ(X)α = λ∗
aϕ∗θ(X)α = λ∗
a(d t) ∧λ∗
a(r) = 0.
Since all ϕa are submersions, θ(X)α = 0 on ϕ(I × U).
□
Deﬁnition 2.4.2 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold. If a vector ﬁeld X on M
satisﬁes θ(X)ω = 0, then we call X a symplectic vector ﬁeld.2
Since d ω = 0, a vector ﬁeld X is a symplectic vector ﬁeld if and only if the 1-form
i(X)ω is closed. According to Lemma 2.4.1, if X is a symplectic vector ﬁeld, then
for any ﬂow ϕ : I × U −→M generated by X, and any a ∈I, we have ϕ∗
a(ω) =
ϕ∗
0(ω) = ω|U. Therefore ϕa is an isomorphism from (U, ω|U) onto (ϕ(U), ω|ϕ(U)).
In the following, we denote the set of all symplectic vector ﬁelds on a symplectic
manifold (M, ω) by S(M, ω). Since the map X −→θ(X) is a real linear map, by the
deﬁnition of symplectic vector ﬁelds, S(M, ω) is a subspace of the vector ﬁelds on
M. Also, since θ([X, Y]) = [θ(X), θ(Y)], thus if X, Y are symplectic vector ﬁelds,
so is [X, Y]. Thus S(M, ω) is a subalgebra of the Lie algebra formed by the vector
ﬁelds on M. If X ∈S(M, ω), then for any open set U ⊂M, X|U ∈S(U, ω|U).
Note that the map X −→i(X)ω, where X is a vector ﬁeld on M, is a bijection.
Therefore, it can be used to deﬁne a canonical isomorphism from the vector space
S(M, ω) onto the vector space of closed 1-forms on M. In order to better study the
property of this isomorphism, we brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of the de Rham group.
Let Z p(M) be the kernel of the map
d : p(M) −→p+1(M),
that is, Z p(M) is the space of all closed p-forms on M. Let B p(M) be the image of
d : p−1(M) −→p(M),
2Added by the authors of the Forewords. Symplectic vector ﬁelds are often called locally Hamilto-
nian vector ﬁelds in other texts.

2.4 Hamiltonian Vector Fields and Symplectic Vector Fields
37
then B p(M) ⊂Z p(M). Thus we can deﬁne
H p(M) = Z p(M)/B p(M),
0 ≤p ≤n,
where n = dim M. We call H p(M) the p-dimensional de Rham group of M. To
indicate that H p(M) is an R-module, we also write it as H p(M, R). It is easy to see
that H 0(M, R) = R if M is connected.
Nowforany X ∈S(M, ω),let X correspondtothecohomologyclassin H 1(M, R)
represented by i(X)ω, then we obtain a canonical onto linear map
ρ : S(M, ω) −→H 1(M, R).
Next, we deﬁne a canonical linear map H from the space C∞(M) into the space
S(M, ω). For any function f ∈C∞(M), let f correspond to the vector ﬁeld H f on
M such that i(H f )ω = d f . Then H f is uniquely determined. Since d f is closed,
H f is a symplectic vector ﬁeld. Also, according to the deﬁnition, the kernel of H
coincides with the kernel of d. Therefore this kernel is the local constant function
space H 0(M, R) on M. As mentioned before, if M is connected, then H 0(M, R) =
R. For any f ∈C∞(M), i(H f )ω is an exact form, so ρ(H f ) = 0. Conversely, if
X ∈S(M, ω) and ρ(X) = 0, then there exists f ∈C∞(M) such that i(X)ω = d f
and X = H f . Thus, we obtain a canonical exact sequence
{0} −→H 0(M, R) −→C∞(M)
H
−→S(M, ω)
ρ
−→H 1(M, R) −→{0}. (2.4.1)
Deﬁnition 2.4.3 The vector ﬁelds of the form H f on a symplectic manifold (M, ω)
are called Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds.
According to the deﬁnition, all Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds are symplectic vector
ﬁelds. If H 1(M, R) = 0, in particularly, if M is simply connected, then it follows
from (2.4.1) that all symplectic vector ﬁelds are Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds. In general,
if H 1(M, ω) ̸= 0, since every closed 1-form coincides with an exact 1-form locally,
any symplectic vector ﬁeld coincides with a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld locally.
Examples 2.4.4
1. Consider a dynamical system in classical mechanic. It can be viewed as a collec-
tion of vector ﬁelds on the tangent bundle T Q of some manifold Q (Q is called a
conﬁguration space, see Refs.[2, 9]). Then a Lagrangian dynamical system is a col-
lection of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds on the T Q equipped with a symplectic structure.
For example, in the Euclidean space Q = R3, a dynamical system that describes the
motion of a particle of mass m under the action of a potential U has the following
form:
X =

whereq1, q2, q3 arenaturalcoordinatesinR3,and ˙qi = d qi, i = 1, 2, 3,arefunctions
on T R3. The trajectory of the particle of mass m is the projection on R3 of the integral
curve of X.
Let
ω = m

then ω is a symplectic structure on T R3. If we let

and i(X)ω = d f . Thus X = H f .
2. Let ω = d x1 ∧d x2 be the canonical symplectic structure on R2, and let
C = x1
∂
∂x1

∂
∂x2
.
Then for any differentiable function f on R2,
d(i( f C)ω) = θ( f C)ω = 2 f ω + d f ∧ω = (2 f + C f )ω.
Thus, in order for f C to be a symplectic vector ﬁeld, it is necessary and sufﬁcient
that C f + 2 f = 0. In general, there is no guarantee that this condition holds in a
neighborhood round 0. For example, if f = (x2
1 + x2
2)−1, then f C is a symplectic
vector ﬁeld on R2\{0}. However, in this case we have
i( f C)ω = x1 d x2 −x2 d x1
x2
1 + x2
2
,
which is not an exact differential form, so the vector ﬁeld C f is not a Hamiltonian
vector ﬁeld.
Remark 2.4.5 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold and let f ∈C∞(M). Then the
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld H f is equal to 0 at x ∈M if and only if d fx = 0, that is, x
is a critical point of f . If M is a compact manifold (with dimension > 0), then every
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld on M has at least two zeros on M, but for a non-Hamiltonian
symplectic vector ﬁeld, it is possible that it is ̸= 0 everywhere on M.

2.4 Hamiltonian Vector Fields and Symplectic Vector Fields

Example 2.4.6 Let f be a nonzero linear form on R2n. Since both d f and the
canonical symplectic structure on R2n are invariant under parallel translations, H f is
also invariant under parallel translations. Let X be the projection of H f on the torus
R2n/Z2n. Then with respect to the quotient symplectic structure on R2n/Z2n, X is a
symplectic vector ﬁeld (cf. 2.1.4 Example 2). This symplectic vector ﬁeld is never
equal to 0.
If (M, ω) is a compact symplectic manifold and H 1(M, R) = {0}, then all auto-
morphisms ϕ deﬁned by the ﬂows on (M, ω) which are generated by some symplectic
vector ﬁeld have at least two ﬁxed points. In fact, in this case, the symplectic vector
ﬁelds are Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds, and their zeros are the ﬁxed points of ϕ. This
property also holds for a C1 proximate automorphism of the identity map of (M, ω)
(see Ref.[29]).
Let (M, ω) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold, and let U be a connected
open subset of M with ﬁnite volume, that is

U
ωn < ∞.
For example, a relatively compact subset. Let X be a symplectic vector ﬁeld on
(M, ω) and let ϕ : I × U −→M be a ﬂow generated by X. Then for any a ∈I,
ϕ∗
a(ω) = ω|U, thus

ϕa(U)
ωn =

U
ωn.
If ϕa(U) ⊂U, then it must be ϕa(U) = U. Let S be the boundary of U. If S is a
hypersurface of M, then it is not possible that the vector X y is transverse at S for
every y ∈S. In the special case that X = H f , the critical points of the restriction of
f on S are the points y such that X y ∈TyS.
Lemma 2.4.7 Let X, Y be two symplectic vector ﬁelds on a symplectic manifold
(M, ω). Then [X, Y] = Hω(Y,X).
Proof In fact,
i([X, Y])ω = θ(X) i(Y)ω −i(Y)θ(X)ω
= θ(X) i(Y)ω = (d i(X) + i(X) d) i(Y)ω
= d(i(X) i(Y)ω) = d ω(Y, X),
thus the lemma follows from the deﬁnition of Hω(Y,X).
□
Lemma 2.4.8 Let X be a symplectic vector ﬁeld on a symplectic manifold (M, ω),
and let f ∈C∞(M). Then
(1) X f = ω(H f , X),
(2) [X, H f ] = HX f .

Symplectic Manifolds
Proof In fact,
X f = d f (X) = (i(H f )ω)(X) = ω(H f , X).
While (2) is a direct consequence of (1) and Lemma 2.4.7.
□
Deﬁnition 2.4.9 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold. We call the real bilinear map
from C∞(M) × C∞(M) into C∞(M) deﬁned by
{ , } : ( f, g) −→{ f, g} = H f g,
f, g ∈C∞(M),
a Poisson bracket.
Lemma 2.4.10 Let f, g be two differentiable functions on a symplectic manifold
(M, ω). Then
{ f, g} = ω(Hg, H f ),
[H f , Hg] = H{ f,g},
where [ , ] is the usual bracket of the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds on M.
Proof In fact,
{ f, g} = H f g = i(H f ) d g = i(H f ) i(Hg)ω = ω(Hg, H f ),
so the ﬁrst equality holds. The second equality follows by applying Lemma 2.4.7. □
Proposition 2.4.11 The Poisson bracket deﬁned above satisﬁes the following equal-
ities:
(1) { f, g} + {g, f } = 0,
(2) { f, {g, h}} + {g, {h, f }} + {h, { f, g}} = 0,
(3) { f, gh} = { f, g}h + g{ f, h},
where f, g, h ∈C∞(M).
Proof (1) follows from { f, g} = ω(Hg, H f ). Using Lemma 2.4.10, we have
{ f, {g, h}} = H f Hgh = [H f , Hg]h + Hg H f h
= H{ f,g}h + {g, { f, h}} = {{ f, g}, h} + {g, { f, h}}.
Thus (2) follows by applying (1). Finally,
{ f, gh} = H f (gh) = (H f g)h + g(H f h) = { f, g}h + g{ f, h}.
Thus (3) holds.
□
The equalities (1) and (2) in Proposition 2.4.11 show that C∞(M) becomes a Lie
algebra over R with respect to the Poisson bracket.

Proposition 2.4.12 If both H 0(M, R) and H 1(M, R) are given the Lie algebra
structures by the zero bracket, then the exact sequence of (2.4.1)
{0} −→H 0(M, R) −→C∞(M)
H
−→S(M, ω)
ρ
−→H 1(M, R) −→{0}
becomes an exact sequence of Lie algebras.
Proof Let f, g ∈H 0(M, R). Since the function g is locally constant, { f, g} =
H f g = 0. Thus the inclusion map H 0(M, R) −→C∞(M) is a Lie algebra homo-
morphism. According to Lemma 2.4.10, H : C∞(M) −→S(M, ω) is also a Lie
algebra homomorphism. Let X, Y ∈S(M, ω) be two symplectic vector ﬁelds.
According to Lemma 2.4.7, we have
i([X, Y])ω = i(Hω(Y,X))ω = d(ω(Y, X)).
Thus the image of [X, Y] in H 1(M, R) is zero, and thus the map
ρ : S(M, ω) −→H 1(M, R)
is a Lie algebra homomorphism.
□
We already know that the set S(M, ω) of symplectic vector ﬁelds is a Lie subal-
gebra of the Lie algebra of the vector ﬁelds on M. By Lemma 2.4.10, we also know
that all Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds form a Lie subalgebra of S(M, ω).
Proposition 2.4.13 The center of the Lie algebra C∞(M) deﬁned by the Poisson
bracket is the space H 0(M, R) of the local constant functions on M.
Proof In fact, if f ∈C∞(M) such that for any g ∈C∞(M) { f, g} = 0, then
H f g = { f, g} = 0 holds for all g ∈C∞(M). Thus H f = 0. Also we have known that
H 0(M, R) is the kernel of H, so f ∈H 0(M, R). Conversely, for any f ∈H 0(M, R),
there is of course { f, g} = 0, ∀g ∈C∞(M).
□
Let (P, ωP) and (Q, ωQ) be two symplectic manifolds and let ϕ : P −→Q be
a differentiable map. Since the map X −→i(X)ωP is an isomorphism from the
module of vector ﬁelds on P onto the module 1(P), so for any vector ﬁeld Y on
Q, there is a unique vector ﬁeld ϕ∗(Y) on P such that the following equality holds
i(ϕ∗(Y))ωP = ϕ∗(i(Y)ωQ).
The map ϕ∗: Y −→ϕ∗(Y) is a real linear map. If g ∈C∞(Q), then
ϕ∗(gY) = ϕ∗(g)ϕ∗(Y).

Lemma 2.4.14 Let (P, ωP), (Q, ωQ), and ϕ be as above. Let Y be a symplectic
vector ﬁeld on Q. Then ϕ∗(Y) is a symplectic vector ﬁeld on P, and for any g ∈
C∞(Q),
ϕ∗(Hg) = Hϕ∗(g).
Proof In fact, if Y is a symplectic vector ﬁeld, then
d i(ϕ∗(Y))ωP = d ϕ∗(i(Y)ωQ) = ϕ∗(d i(Y)ωQ) = 0,
so by the deﬁnition of θ(ϕ∗(Y)),
θ(ϕ∗(Y))ωP = d i(ϕ∗(Y))ωP + i(ϕ∗(Y)) d ωP = 0.
Thus ϕ∗(Y) is a symplectic vector ﬁeld. Also, for any function g ∈C∞(Q),
i(ϕ∗(Hg))ωP = ϕ∗(i(Hg)ωQ) = ϕ∗(d g) = d ϕ∗(g),
so ϕ∗(Hg) = Hϕ∗(g).
□
Lemma 2.4.15 Let (P, ωP) and (Q, ωQ) be two symplectic manifolds, and let
ϕ : (P, ωP) −→(Q, ωQ)
be a symplectic manifold homomorphism. Then for any x ∈P and any vector ﬁeld
Y on Q, the vector
ϕT (ϕ∗(Y)x) −Yϕ(x)
is orthogonal to ϕT (Tx P) with respect to (ωQ)ϕ(x).
Proof In fact, since ωP = ϕ∗(ωQ), so for any vector v ∈Tx P, we have
ωQ(ϕT (ϕ∗(Y)x), ϕT (v)) = ωP(ϕ∗(Y)x, v) = (i(ϕ∗(Y))ωP)(v)
= ϕ∗(i(Y)ωQ)(v) = (i(Y)ωQ)(ϕT (v)) = ωQ(Yϕ(x), ϕT (v)).
Thus the conclusion holds.

Proposition 2.4.16 Let (P, ωP) and (Q, ωQ) be two symplectic manifolds, and let
ϕ : (P, ωP) −→(Q, ωQ)

C∞(Q),
ϕ∗{ f, g} = {ϕ∗( f ), ϕ∗(g)},

and for any two vector ﬁelds X, Y on Q,
ϕ∗[X, Y] = [ϕ∗(X), ϕ∗(Y)].
Proof Since dim P = dim Q, ϕ is a local symplectic manifold isomorphism. Note
that the deﬁnition of the Poisson bracket is local, then it can be seen that the ﬁrst
equality holds naturally. We give a direct proof as follows. By Lemma 2.4.15, we
have ϕT ◦ϕ∗(Y) = Y ◦ϕ, thus ϕ∗(Y)ϕ∗(g) = ϕ∗(Yg) holds for any vector ﬁeld Y
over Q and any g ∈C∞(Q). Thus, if f, g ∈C∞(Q), then by Lemma 2.4.14,
{ϕ∗( f ), ϕ∗(g)} = Hϕ∗( f )ϕ∗(g) = ϕ∗(H f )ϕ∗(g) = ϕ∗(H f g) = ϕ∗{ f, g}.
Now let X, Y be two vector ﬁelds on Q and let g ∈C∞, then
(ϕ∗[X, Y])ϕ∗(g) = ϕ∗([X, Y]g) = ϕ∗(X)ϕ∗(Yg) −ϕ∗(Y)ϕ∗(Xg)
= [ϕ∗(X), ϕ∗(Y)]ϕ∗(g).
Since ϕ is a submersion, we must have ϕ∗[X, Y] = [ϕ∗(X), ϕ∗(Y)].
□
With the assumption of Proposition 2.4.16, the map ϕ∗: C∞(Q) −→C∞(P) is
a Lie algebra homomorphism (deﬁne the Lie algebra structures on them by using
the Poisson brackets). It must be noted that a symplectic manifold homomorphism
which is not a local homeomorphism does not have this property.
Example 2.4.17 Let (P, ωP) = (R2, d y1 ∧d y2) and let
(Q, ωQ) = (R4, d x1 ∧d x3 + d x2 ∧d x4).
Then the immersion: ϕ : (a1, a2) −→(a1, 0, a2, 0) is a symplectic manifold homo-
morphism, and we have ϕ∗(x1x4) = ϕ∗(x1x2) = 0. We compute {x1x4, x1x2}. Since
ωQ = d x1 ∧d x3 + d x2 ∧d x4, so

Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold. Since we consider only local properties in this
section, we may assume that (x1, . . . , x2n) is a symplectic coordinate system on the
entire(M, ω).Thus,iftheopensubsetsofR2n areconsideredassymplecticmanifolds

Now let (M, ω) = (R2n, ω), where ω = n
i=1 d xi ∧d xn+i is the canonical sym-
plectic structure on R2n. Let P be the subalgebra of C∞(R2n) formed by the polyno-
mialfunctions.Foranyintegerr ≥0,let Pr bethespacespannedbythehomogeneous
polynomials of degree r. By formula (2.5.1), for any r, s ≥0, {Pr, Ps} ⊂Pr+s−2. Put
gr = Pr+2, then {gr, gs} ⊂gr+s. Give a Z-gradation to P according to gr, we obtain
a graded Lie algebra.
The center of this graded Lie algebra is g−2, i.e. the space of constant functions.
The space g−1 is formed by the linear functions on R2n, and the space g0 is spanned by
the 2-forms. The space g0 is a Lie subalgebra of dimension n(2n + 1). By using the
map f −→H f , we can deﬁne an isomorphism from g−1 onto the space spanned by
theconstantvectorﬁelds(vectorﬁeldsthatareinvariantundertheparalleltranslations
of R2n). By using the same map, we can also obtain an isomorphism from g0 onto
the Lie subalgebra of S(R2n, ω) spanned by the ﬁrst order symplectic vector ﬁelds.
This subalgebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra sp(R2n, ω0) of the symplectic group
Sp(2n) introduced in Sect.1.4. In fact, let α be an endomorphism of R2n, and let Lα
be the vector ﬁeld on R2n satisfying
Lα · xi = −xi ◦α,
i = 1, . . . , 2n.
For any ξ ∈R2n, let Lξ be the vector ﬁeld satisfying
Lξ xi = xi(ξ),
i = 1, . . . , 2n.
Then [Lα, Lξ] = −Lα(ξ). Thus for any ξ, η ∈R2n,
(θ(Lα)ω)(Lξ, Lη) = Lαω(Lξ, Lη) −ω([Lα, Lξ], Lη) −ω(Lξ, [Lα, Lη])
= ω(Lα(ξ), Lη) + ω(Lξ, Lα(η)) = ω0(α(ξ), η) + ω0(ξ, α(η)),
where
ω0 =
n

i=1
xi ∧xn+i ∈A2(R2n).
Thus the vector ﬁeld Lα is a symplectic vector ﬁeld if and only if α ∈sp(R2n, ω0).
Lemma 2.5.1 If f ∈P1 and f ̸= 0, then the endomorphism map of P given by
g −→{ f, g},
g ∈P,
is an onto endomorphism.
Proof In fact, let (u1, . . . , u2n) be a symplectic basis of the symplectic space
(R2n, ω0) such that f (ui) = δ1i, and let (y1, . . . , y2n) be the dual basis of (u1, . . . ,
u2n). Then y1, . . . , y2n form a symplectic coordinate system on the manifold (R2n, ω)
and the equality
{ f, g} = −∂g

Symplectic Manifolds
holds for any g ∈P. Thus the statement holds.
□
Lemma 2.5.2 The only ideal subalgebras in the Lie algebra P are {0}, P0 (spanned
by zero degree polynomials), and P.
Proof In fact, let a be an ideal of the Lie algebra P that contains polynomial functions
of degree > 0. Since for all i, {xi, a} ⊂a, thus a is invariant under the action of
∂
∂xi for
all i. Thus, a contains a polynomial f = f0 + f1, where f0 ∈P0, f1 ∈P1\{0}. Then
for any g ∈P, we have { f, g} = { f1, g}. So since the map g −→{ f1, g}, g ∈P,
is onto (Lemma 2.5.1), a = P. Also, {0} and P0 are obviously ideals.
□
2.5.3 The Lie algebra of formal symplectic vector ﬁelds. Let (M, ω) be a symplec-
tic manifold and let x ∈M. Let m∞
x be the maximal ideal formed by the functions of
C∞(M) whose values at the point x are zero, and let m p
x the maximal ideal formed
by the functions of C p(M) whose values at the point x are zero. Then
m∞
x =

p>0

x .
According to Proposition 2.4.11, for any f ∈C∞(M), the map g −→{ f, g}, g ∈
C∞(M), is a derivation of C∞(M). Thus for any p > 0, { f, m p
x } ⊂m p−1
x
, so
{ f, m∞
x } ⊂m∞
x . This implies that m∞
x is not only an ideal for the associative algebra
structure on C∞(M), but it is also an ideal for the Lie algebra structure deﬁned by
the Poisson bracket. Thus, we can deﬁne a quotient algebra by using m∞
x . We call
the quotient algebra
Jx(M) = C∞(M)/m∞
x
the jet algebra at the point x. It is a Lie algebra. We also call the Lie algebra bracket
on Jx(M) a Poisson bracket and denote it by { , }.
Proposition 2.5.4 {0}, R, and Jx(M) are the only ideals in the Lie algebra Jx(M).
Proof {0} and R are obviously ideals of Jx(M). We show that except {0} and R,
the only ideal in Jx(M) is Jx(M) itself. For this, choose a symplectic coordinate
system on some neighborhood of x that is zero at the point x. Then the case under
consideration is reduced to the case of the jet algebra J0(R2n) of functions of the
symplectic manifold (R2n, ω) at the origin, where ω = n
i=1 d xi ∧d xn+i is the
canonical symplectic structure. As an associative algebra, J0(R2n) is equal to the
algebra of formal series on x1, . . . , x2n. If
f =

47
then
{ f, g} =

p,q≥0
{ f p, gq}.
Let a be an ideal of the Lie algebra J0(R2n) that is not contained in R = P0. Since
{xi, a} ⊂a, i = 1, . . . , 2n, a is invariant under the action of the partial derivatives
∂
∂xi , i = 1, . . . , 2n. Thus, in a, there exists at least one element h = 
p≥0 h p, h p ∈
Pp, such that h1 is a nonzero element in P1. Then the map g −→{h, g}, g ∈
J0(R2n), is an onto endomorphism of J0(R2n). In fact, if
g =

p≥0
gp ∈J0(R2n),
then the term of {h, g} contained in Pr is
{h, g}r = {h1, gr+1} + {h2, gr} + · · · + {hr+1, g1}.
Thus by Lemma 2.5.1, for any
f =

p≥0
f p ∈J0(R2n),
we can deﬁne gp recursively such that
fr = {h1, gr+1} + {h2, gr} + · · · + {hr+1, g1}
holds for any r. Let g = 
p≥0 gp, then {h, g} = f . But h ∈a, so f ∈a. Since f is
arbitrary, a = J0(R2n).
□
Let X be a vector ﬁeld on a manifold M. Then the Lie derivation θ(X) : f −→X f
keeps m∞
x
invariant. By taking quotient, it induces a derivation Jx(X) on the jet
algebra Jx(M), which we call a jet of the vector ﬁeld X at the point x. If (M, ω) is
a symplectic manifold, then the composition map of the following two maps
f −→H f
and
X −→Jx(X)
is a homomorphism from the Lie algebra C∞(M) into the Lie algebra formed by
the derivations of Jx(M). Since any symplectic vector ﬁeld coincides with a Hamil-
tonian vector ﬁeld on some neighborhood of x, the image of the homomorphism
map f −→Jx(H f ) is the jet Lie algebra of the symplectic vector ﬁelds at the
point x. If f ∈m∞
x , then H f C∞(M) ⊂m∞
x , so Jx(H f ) = 0. By taking quotient,
we obtain an onto homomorphism from the Lie algebra Jx(M) to the Lie alge-
bra of the jets of the symplectic vector ﬁelds at the point x. If f ∈C∞(M) and
Jx(H f ) = 0, then H f C∞(M) ⊂m∞
x , thus for all g ∈C∞(M), { f, g} ∈m∞
x . This

implies f −f (x) ∈m∞
x . Thus Jx( f ) is the jet of the constant f (x). Summarize, we
obtain an exact sequence
{0} −→R −→Jx(M) −→Jx(S(M, ω)) −→{0}.
Proposition 2.5.5 The Lie algebra formed by the jets of all symplectic vector ﬁelds
on a symplectic manifold at a given point is a simple Lie algebra.
Proof Since Jx(S(M, ω)) is isomorphic to Jx(M)/R, thus this proposition is actually
a different version of the statement of Proposition 2.5.4.
□
2.6
Submanifolds of Symplectic Manifolds
Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold and let N be a submanifold of M. If x ∈N,
then Tx N is a vector subspace of the symplectic vector space (Tx(M), ωx).
Deﬁnition 2.6.1 A submanifold N of a symplectic manifold (M, ω) is called an
isotropic (or coisotropic, Lagrangian, symplectic, respectively) submanifold, if for
all x ∈N, the space Tx N is an isotropic (or coisotropic, Lagrangian, symplectic,
respectively) subspace of the symplectic space (Tx M, ωx).
For an immersion of a manifold P into a symplectic manifold (M, ω), we use the
same terminologies. For example, an immersion ϕ : P −→M is called a Lagrangian
immersion, if for all y ∈P, ϕT always maps Ty P to a Lagrangian subspace of
(Tϕ(y), ωϕ(y)).
Regardless whether a submanifold N of (M, ω) is isotropic, coisotropic,
Lagrangian, or symplectic, the pullback ω|N of ω on N is always a constant rank
2-form. If N is coisotropic, then the rank of ω|N is equal to 2 dim N −dim M. If N
is a Lagrangian submanifold of M, then dim N = 1
2 dim M.
Let N be a submanifold of M. We deﬁne a vector bundle TN M over the base
space N by letting the ﬁber of TN M over the point x ∈N be Tx M. So each ﬁber has
a symplectic vector space structure. Consider T N as a vector subbundle of TN M,
and denote the subbundle of TN M whose ﬁber at the point x is (Tx N)⊥by T N ⊥.
Then, in order for the submanifold N to be isotropic (or coisotropic), it is necessary
and sufﬁcient that T N ⊂T N ⊥(or T N ⊃T N ⊥). In order for N be Lagrangian,
it is necessary and sufﬁcient that T N = T N ⊥. If T N ∩T N ⊥= {0}, then N is a
symplectic submanifold.
Lemma 2.6.2 (A. Weinstein’s extension lemma) Let M be a 2n-dimensional mani-
fold, and let N be a closed submanifold of M. Let ω0, ω1 be two symplectic structures
on M such that their restrictions on 2(TN M) are equal. Then there exist two open
neighborhoods U0 and U1 of N in M, and a diffeomorphism ϕ1 from U0 onto U1,
such that the restriction of ϕ1 on N is the identity map and ω0 = ϕ∗
1(ω1).

2.6 Submanifolds of Symplectic Manifolds
49
Proof We need to quote a general version of the following Poincaré Lemma (see
Ref.[29]): Since N is a closed submanifold, there exist an open neighborhood V of
N in M and a 1-form β on V such that β is zero on TN M and d β = (ω0 −ω1)|V .
Denote the projection from R × M onto R by t, view the differential forms on R and
their pullbacks on R × M by the projection as the same, then we can assume that
˜ω = ω0 + t(ω1 −ω0) ∈2(R × M).
The rank of this differential form is 2n at every point of R × N. Thus its rank is
also 2n on some open neighborhood of R × N in R × M, we let V ′ be such an open
neighborhood. Since R × V is an open neighborhood of R × N, we can choose V ′
such that V ′ ⊂R × V . According to the deﬁnition of β and the choice of V ′, we know
that the kernel of β|V ′ is a sub-vector bundle of T V ′ generated by the vector ﬁeld ∂
∂t .
Since i
 ∂
∂t

β = 0, there exists a vector ﬁeld X on V ′ such that i(X) ˜ω = β|V ′. Also,
we can choose X such that i(X) d t = 0. This is possible since it amounts to choosing
a vector ﬁeld on a neighborhood of N so it does not depend on the parameter t. Since
β is zero on TN M, so the vector ﬁeld X is identically zero on R × N. Thus, there
exists an open neighborhood W of [0, 1] × N in R × M and a differentiable map
ϕ : W −→R × M, such that
(1) ϕT ◦∂
∂t = (X + ∂
∂t ) ◦ϕ, and
(2) ϕ(0, x) = x, ∀(0, x) ∈W.
Note that in (ϕ(W)), condition (1) is equivalent to
θ

.
Apply this to the function t to get ∂
∂t (t ◦ϕ) = 1. Thus t ◦ϕ = t on some neighbor-
hood of [0, 1] × N (refer to the ﬁgure).
For any x ∈N, by the deﬁnition of W, there exists an open neighborhood Vx of x
in M such that [0, 1] × Vx ⊂W. Thus, there exists an open neighborhood U0 of N

50

Symplectic Manifolds
in M such that [0, 1] × U0 ⊂W. For any a ∈[0, 1], deﬁne a map ϕa from U0 into
M by
ϕ(a, x) = (a, ϕa(x)), ∀x ∈U0.
We show that the family of differential forms ϕ∗
a( ˜ω) on U0 does not depend on a.
Note that this family of differential forms is actually given by i

Thus ϕ∗( ˜ω) does not depend on the parameter a ∈[0, 1], and thus ϕ∗
1(ω1) = ϕ∗
0(ω0).
Since ϕ0 is the identity map, so we have ϕ∗
1(ω1) = ω0, that is, ϕ1 is an isomorphism
from (U0, ω0) onto (ϕ1(U0), ω1). Also since X is 0 on R × N, so the restriction of
ϕ1 on N is the identity map.
□
Remarks 2.6.3
1. Since we assume that ω0 and ω1 are equal not only on 2T N but on 2TN M, so we
are able to choose a 1-form β on some neighborhood of N such that d β = ω0 −ω1.
Moreover, we can choose such a β, so it is not just that βx = 0 for any x ∈N, but
also that the ﬁrst order jet ﬂow of β is zero at any point of N. When β has these
properties, the corresponding homeomorphism ϕ1 provides a tangent bundle map ϕT
1
which is equal to the identity on TN M (see Ref.[29]).
2. By applying Lemma 2.6.2 to N = {x}, it implies that there exist symplectic coor-
dinates on some neighborhood of x ∈M.
Proposition 2.6.4 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold, and let N be a closed
Lagrangian submanifold of (M, ω). Then for any point x ∈N, there exist an open
neighborhood V of x and symplectic coordinates y1, . . . , y2n on V , such that N ∩V
is the set of points in V satisfying y1 = . . . = yn = 0.
Proof In fact, let U be an open neighborhood of x, and let x1, . . . , x2n be a coordinate
systemonU suchthatforthepointsin N ∩U, x1 = x2 = . . . = xn = 0 hold.Thenby
applying Lemma 2.6.2 to the symplectic structures ω0 = ω|U and ω1 = n
i=1 d xi ∧
d xn+i, we obtain the desired symplectic coordinates yi = ϕ∗
1(xi).

2.6 Submanifolds of Symplectic Manifolds
51
The Lagrangian submanifolds in a symplectic manifold are important in sym-
plectic manifold theory, they are related to the discussions of many topics. We ﬁrst
consider a couple of examples, then give a basic Lagrangian submanifold construc-
tion method.
Examples 2.6.5
1. Let (M, ω) be a 2-dimensional symplectic manifold. Then its Lagrangian subman-
ifolds are the 1-dimensional submanifolds, in other words, all its embedded curves.
2. We now consider the Lagrangian submanifolds of (R2n, ω). Let x1, . . . , x2n be
symplectic coordinates on R2n such that ω = n
i=1 d xi ∧d xn+i. Let U be an open
subset of Rn, let ϕ : x −→(ϕ1(x), . . . , ϕn(x)) be a differentiable map from U into
Rn,andlet Nϕ = {(x, ϕ(x)) : x ∈U}.Then Nϕ iscalledthegraphofϕ inU × Rn ⊂
R2n. In order for Nϕ to be a Lagrangian submanifold of (R2n, ω), it is necessary and
sufﬁcient that the immersion x −→(x, ϕ(x)), x ∈U, is an isotropic immersion.
This condition can be expressed as n
i=1 d xi ∧d ϕi = 0. State it differently, in order
for Nϕ to be a Lagrangian submanifold of (R2n, ω), it is necessary and sufﬁcient that
the 1-form n
i=1 ϕi d xi is a closed form. If n
i=1 ϕi d xi is the total differential of
some function f : U −→R, then of course it is closed. In this spacial case, we call
f a generating function of the Lagrangian submanifold Nϕ.
Let
ψ : (x, y) −→(ψ1(x, y), . . . , ψn(x, y))
be a differentiable map from U × Rn into Rn. We deﬁne another map  by using ψ:
 : (x, y) −→(x, y + ψ(x, y)),
(x, y) ∈U × Rn.
Then  is a differentiable map from U × Rn into itself. In order for  to be an
endomorphism of the symplectic manifold (U × Rn, ω), it is necessary and sufﬁcient
that
n

i=1
d xi ∧d ψi = 0.
This amounts to the requirement that ψ(x, y) does not depend on y and n
i=1 ψi d xi
is a closed form on U. If ψ satisﬁes these two conditions, the  is an automorphism
of the symplectic manifold (U × Rn, ω). Conversely, if n
i=1 ψi d xi is an arbitrary
closed differential 1-form on U, then we can deﬁne a  as above by using the coef-
ﬁcients ψi of the d xi, i = 1, . . . , n, then obtain an automorphism of (U × Rn, ω).
Thus, there exists a canonical isomorphism between the additive group of the closed

52
2
Symplectic Manifolds
differential forms on U and the group of automorphisms of the symplectic manifold
(U × Rn, ω) that keep the ﬁber Rn invariant. The restriction of an element of this
automorphism group on the ﬁber {x} × Rn is a parallel transformation. The corre-
sponding Lagrangian submanifold Nϕ is the image of the Lagrangian submanifold
U × {0} under the map .
Proposition 2.6.6 Let (M1, ω1) and (M2, ω2) be two symplectic manifolds, and let
ϕ : M1 −→M2 be a differentiable map. Then ϕ is a homomorphism of symplectic
manifolds if and only if the graph {(x, ϕ(x)) : x ∈M1} is an isotropic submanifold
of the symplectic manifold (M1, ω1) × (M2, −ω2).
Proof In fact, let ˜ϕ be the immersion from M1 into M1 × M2 deﬁned by
x −→(x, ϕ(x)),
x ∈M1.
Then we have
˜ϕ∗(pr∗
1(ω1) −pr∗
2(ω2)) = ω1 −ϕ∗(ω2).
Thus ϕ is a symplectic manifold homomorphism is equivalent to the graph of ϕ being
an isotropic submanifold of (M1, ω1) × (M2, −ω2).
□
If dim M1 = dim M2, then the graph of a symplectic manifold homomorphism
from (M1, ω1) into (M2, ω2) is a Lagrangian submanifold, because in this case,
the graph of this homomorphism is a dimension dim M1 isotropic submanifold of
(M1, ω1) × (M2, −ω2). But a Lagrangian submanifold of (M1, ω1) × (M2, −ω2) is
not necessary a graph of some homomorphism.
2.6.7 Constructing Lagrangian submanifolds using the contraction method. Let
(M, ω) be a symplectic manifold, and let N ⊂M be a coisotropic submanifold of M.
Moreover, assume that (M′, ω′) is another symplectic manifold, and ϕ : N −→M′
is a submersion such that ϕ∗(ω′) = ω|N. Since N is a coisotropic submanifold, ω|N
has constant rank. Thus by the Corollary of Proposition 2.3.5, we can always ﬁnd a
symplectic manifold (M′, ω′) and a submersion ϕ such that they satisfy the condition
above at some neighborhood of any point of N.
Let L be a Lagrangian submanifold of (M, ω). We assume that L and N have a
“good intersection”, that is
(1) L ∩N is a submanifold of M, and
(2) T (L ∩N) = T L ∩T N.

2.6 Submanifolds of Symplectic Manifolds
53
Let x ∈L ∩N. Since Tx N is a coisotropic subspace of (Tx M, ωx), the subspace
Tx L ∩Tx N + Tx N ⊥is a Lagrangian subspace of (Tx N, (ω|N)x) (Proposition 1.2.7).
Since
ϕT
x : Tx N −→Tϕ(x)M′
is an onto map and ϕ∗(ω′) = ω|N, the subspace
ϕT
x (Tx L ∩Tx N + Tx N ⊥)
is a Lagrangian subspace of (Tϕ(x)M′, ω′
ϕ(x)). But
T N ⊥⊂ker ϕT
and
Tx L ∩Tx N = Tx(L ∩N),
thus for any x ∈M, ϕT (Tx(L ∩N)) is a Lagrangian subspace of (Tϕ(x)M′, ω′
ϕ(x)).
This shows that the restriction of ϕ on L ∩N is of constant rank 1
2 dim M′. Locally on
N, this restriction factorizes into a submersion followed by a Lagrangian immersion
into M′.
Thus, for any x ∈L ∩N, there exists a neighborhood V of x in N such that ϕ(V )
is a Lagrangian submanifold of (M′, ω′). We say that a Lagrangian submanifold of
(M′, ω′) constructed this way is obtained by contracting the Lagrangian submanifold
L.
We consider an example next.

j=1 d z j d z j be the canonical Hermitian form. The imaginary
part of h is −n+1
j=1 d x j ∧d y j. This is a symplectic structure on Cn+1. If we denote
by p the canonical projection from Cn+1\{0} onto the projective space CPn, then by

Lagrangian submanifold of the symplectic manifold (Cn+1, −

E ∩S2n+1 is an n-dimensional sphere.
The restriction of the canonical projection p on E ∩S2n+1 is an immersion, by
taking quotient, a homeomorphism from the real projective space determined by E
onto some Lagrangian submanifold of CPn can be obtained from it.
2.6.9 Poisson bracket and coisotropic submanifolds. Let (M, ω) be a symplectic
manifold and let N be a coisotropic submanifold of (M, ω). If the restriction of a
function f ∈C∞(M) to N is a constant, then for any vector v ∈T N,
(i(H f )ω)(v) = d f (v) = 0.
Thus for any x ∈N, (H f )(x) ∈T N ⊥. Since N is coisotropic, T N ⊥⊂T N, thus
for any x, (H f )(x) ∈T N. Therefore, the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds deﬁned by the
functions whose restrictions to N are constants are tangent to N.
Now let f, g ∈C∞(M) and assume that both their restrictions on N are constants.
Then since H f is tangent to N, for any x ∈N, { f, g}(x) = (H f g)(x) = 0. This
shows that all differentiable functions on M whose restrictions to N are constants
form a Lie subalgebra of C∞(M) with respect to the Poisson bracket.
We now further assume that the codimension of N is k. Let f1, . . . , fk ∈C∞(M)
be functions that are zero on N and for all the points on N, d f1 ∧· · · ∧d fk ̸= 0.
Then for any x ∈N, the vectors (H f1)(x), . . . , (H fk)(x) form a basis of Tx N ⊥,
and Tx N is the orthogonal complement of the subspace of (Tx M, ωx) spanned by
(H f1)(x), . . . , (H fk)(x).
Exercise 2.6.9 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold and let E be an integrable
subbundle of T M. We further assume that E is a Lagrangian subbundle, that is, for
all x ∈M, Ex is a Lagrangian subspace of (Tx M, ωx). Let P be a submanifold of
M. If P satisﬁes the two conditions below:
(1) Tx P = Ex, ∀x ∈P, and

2.6 Submanifolds of Symplectic Manifolds
55
(2) under the set inclusion relation, P is a maximal element in the set of all subman-
ifolds of M that satisfy condition (1),
then we call P an integral leaf of E. Since we assume that E is a Lagrangian
subbundle, every integral leaf of E is a Lagrangian submanifold of (M, ω). We say
that E deﬁnes a Lagrangian foliation on (M, ω).
Prove that if X, Y are two differentiable cross sections of E, then there exists a
unique vector ﬁeld ▽XY such that for any vector ﬁeld Z on M,
ω(▽XY, Z) = Xω(Y, Z) −ω(Y, [X, Z]),
and that ▽XY is a cross section of E. Also, prove that for two differentiable cross
sections X, Y of E (see Ref.[28]),
▽XY −▽Y X = [X, Y],
▽X(▽Y Z) −▽Y(▽X Z) = ▽[X,Y]Z,
where Z is a vector ﬁeld on M.
Thus derive that, for any integral leaf P of E, there exists a linear connection ▽,
whose curvature and torsion are zero, and it can be characterized as follows4: if X
and Y are two differentiable cross sections of E, then
▽X|P(Y|P) = (▽XY)|P.
We will give examples of Lagrangian foliations by using cotangent bundles in
Sect.3.1.
4Added by the authors of the Forewords. The existence of a ﬂat torsionless connection on the leaves
of a Lagrangian foliation of a symplectic manifold was observed by the French mathematician
Paulette Libermann in her thesis (Sur le problème d’équivalence de certaines structures inﬁnitési-

Liouville Forms and Canonical Symplectic Structures
on Cotangent Bundles
In this section, we denote by P a manifold, and denote the cotangent bundle on P
by T ∗P. The ﬁber T ∗
x P of T ∗P at any point x ∈P is the dual space of the vector
space Tx P, and the elements in T ∗
x P are the cotangent vectors at the point x. We
use π and π∗to denote the projections of T P and T ∗P on P respectively. We use
T (T ∗P) to denote the tangent bundle of the cotangent bundle T ∗P and use π0 to
denote the projection of T (T ∗P) on the base space T ∗P. Denote the tangent space
map deﬁned by π∗as π T
∗, then
π T

ϕ2 : (ξ, u) −→ξ(u),
(ξ, u) ∈T ∗P ×
P T P.
Then ϕ2 is also a differentiable map. The composition map ϕ2 ◦ϕ1 of ϕ1 and ϕ2
is a differentiable map from T (T ∗P) into R, its restriction on every ﬁber Tξ(T ∗P)
(ξ ∈T ∗P) is a linear map. Thus it is a differential 1-form on the manifold T ∗P, and it
is a very important differential 1-form. For our convenience, if (ξ, u) ∈T ∗P ×
P T P,
we denote the real number ξ(u) as ⟨ξ, u⟩.
Deﬁnition 3.1.1 Deﬁne a differential 1-form α on the cotangent bundle T ∗P as
follows. For any v ∈T (T ∗P), let
α(v) = ⟨π0(v), π T
∗(v)⟩.
(3.1.1)
We call α the Liouville form on T ∗P.
It is obvious that if α is the Liouville form on T ∗P, then ker α ⊃ker π T
∗. We call
a vector v ∈T (T ∗P) that satisﬁes π T
∗(v) = 0 a vertical vector. Then the Liouville
form is zero on the vertical vectors of T (T ∗P).
Let X be an arbitrary vector ﬁeld on P. We use X to deﬁne a differentiable function
fX on T ∗P as follows:
fX(ξ) = ⟨ξ, X(π∗(ξ))⟩,
∀ξ ∈T ∗P,
where X(π∗(ξ)) denotes the value of the vector ﬁeld X at the point π∗(ξ) ∈P. Thus
fX = 0 if and only if X = 0. Thus the map
F : X −→fX,
X is vector ﬁeld on P,
is a real linear inclusion map. Its image is a subspace of C∞(T ∗P), the restrictions
of every function of this subspace on the ﬁbers of T ∗P are linear. If g ∈C∞(P) and
X is a vector ﬁeld on P, then fgX = (g ◦π∗) fX.
Let U be an open subset of P, let x1, . . . , xn be coordinates on U, and let
yi = f
∂
∂xi ,
i = 1, . . . , n.
Then the functions (x1 ◦π∗), . . . , (xn ◦π∗), y1, . . . , yn form a coordinate system on
π−1
∗(U) = T ∗U. To simplify our notation, we identify an element g in C∞(P) with
theelement g ◦π∗inC∞(T ∗P).Accordingtothisassumption, x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn
form a coordinate system on π−1
∗(U). If the expression of a vector ﬁeld X on U is

i=1 ai ∂

∗(U), we have
fX =

(3.1.3)
Proposition 3.1.2 Let α be the Liouville form on the cotangent bundle T ∗P, then
the 2-from ω = −d α is a symplectic structure on T ∗P.
Proof In fact, according to (3.1.3), if x1, . . . , xn are coordinates on a coordinate
neighborhood U in P, then there are coordinates x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn on π−1
∗(U)
such that
ω =
n

i=1
d xi ∧d yi.
Thus the rank of ω at every point of T ∗P is always 2n. Also, since it is a closed form,
it is a symplectic structure.
□
We call the 2-form ω = −d α the canonical symplectic structure on T ∗P. Let
U ⊂P be a coordinate neighborhood in P, and let x1, . . . , xn be coordinates on U.
Then
xi = xi ◦π∗
and
yi = f
∂
∂xi ,
i = 1, . . . , n,
are symplectic coordinates on π−1
∗(U). We call them local symplectic coordinates
on T ∗P induced by x1, . . . , xn.
Canonical symplectic structures play an important role in classical mechanics.
By using the Legendre transformation, we can transform a Lagrangian dynamical
system on a tangent bundle T Q (see2.4.4 Example 1) to a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld
on the cotangent bundle T ∗Q that is equipped with the canonical symplectic structure
(see reference [2]).

Cotangent Bundles
We know that any differential 1-form on a manifold P corresponds to a dif-
ferentiable cross section of the vector bundle T ∗P. If β ∈	1(P), we denote the
corresponding cross section by β.
Proposition 3.1.3 The Liouville form α on T ∗P can be characterized by the follow-
ing property: for any differential 1-form β, β = α ◦β
T (= β
∗(α)).
Proof Let x ∈P, u ∈Tx P, and β ∈	1(P). Then since π∗◦β is the identity map
on P, we have (π T
∗◦β
T )(u) = u. On the other hand, since π0 ◦β
T = β ◦π, by
formula (3.1.1),
(α ◦β
T )(u) = ⟨(π0 ◦β
T )(u), (π T
∗◦β
T )(u)⟩
= ⟨β(x), u⟩= β(u),
(x = π(u)).
This proves β = α ◦β
T . Furthermore, for any point ξ ∈T ∗
x P, the tangent space
Tξ(T ∗P) is generated by the collection of vectors in all β
T (Tx P), where β ∈	1(P)
and β(x) = ξ. Thus α is uniquely determined by the equality β = α ◦β
T .
□
Let P and Q be two manifolds, and let ϕ : P −→Q be a differentiable map. If we
assume that ϕ is a local diffeomorphism, then for any x ∈P, ϕT
x is an isomorphism
from Tx P onto Tϕ(x)Q. Thus we have an inverse isomorphism
(ϕT
x )−1 : Tϕ(x)Q −→Tx P.
The conjugate map of the isomorphism above deﬁnes an isomorphism
T ∗
x ϕ : T ∗
x P −→T ∗
ϕ(x)Q.
Thus we can deﬁne a differentiable map T ∗ϕ from T ∗P onto T ∗Q, such that the
restriction of T ∗ϕ on each ﬁber T ∗
x P is the T ∗
x ϕ above. Then, for any x ∈P, u ∈Tx P,
and ξ ∈T ∗
x P, we have
⟨(T ∗ϕ)(ξ), ϕT (u)⟩= ⟨ξ, u⟩.
(3.1.4)
If β ∈	1(Q), then
⟨(T ∗ϕ)((ϕ∗β)x), ϕT (u)⟩= ⟨(ϕ∗β)x, u⟩= ⟨βϕ(x), ϕT (u)⟩.
Therefore,
(T ∗ϕ) ◦(ϕ∗β) = β ◦ϕ.
Proposition 3.1.4 Let P and Q be two manifolds, and let αP and αQ be the Liouville
forms on T ∗P and T ∗Q respectively. Let ϕ : P −→Q be a differentiable map, and
assume that ϕ is a local homeomorphism, then αP = αQ ◦(T ∗ϕ)T .
Proof In fact, by (3.1.1) and (3.1.4), for any ξ ∈T ∗P and v ∈Tξ(T ∗P),

3.1 Liouville Forms and Canonical Symplectic Structures on Cotangent Bundles
61
(αQ ◦(T ∗ϕ)T )(v) = ⟨(π0 ◦(T ∗ϕ)T )(v), (π T
∗◦(T ∗ϕ)T )(v)⟩
= ⟨(T ∗ϕ)(ξ), (ϕT ◦π T
∗)(v)⟩
= ⟨ξ, π T
∗(v)⟩= ⟨π0(v), π T
∗(v)⟩= αP(v).
Therefore the equality holds.
□
Corollary 3.1.5 Assumptions are as in Proposition 3.1.4. Then T ∗ϕ : T ∗P −→
T ∗Q is a symplectic homomorphism.
Example 3.1.6 By using cotangent bundles as symplectic manifolds, we can obtain
a lot of examples of Lagrangian foliations. In fact, if P is a manifold, then we can take
the canonical symplectic structure so that T ∗P is a symplectic manifold. Take a coor-
dinate neighborhoodU in P, let x1, . . . , xn be coordinates onU. Then on the subman-
ifold π−1
∗(U) of T ∗P, there exist the symplectic coordinates x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn
induced by x1, . . . , xn. Consider π−1
∗(U) as a symplectic manifold, and let
E =

1≤i≤n
ker d xi.
Then E is an integrable Lagrangian subbundle of T (π−1
∗(U)). Each ﬁber space of
π−1
∗(U) is both an integrable leave of E and a Lagrangian submanifold of π−1
∗(U),
thus E deﬁnes a Lagrangian foliation on π−1
∗(U).
3.2
Symplectic Vector Fields on a Cotangent Bundle
In this section, P denotes a manifold, α denotes the Liouville form on T ∗P, and
ω denotes the canonical symplectic structure −d α. Let U be a coordinate neigh-
borhood in P, let x1, . . . , xn be coordinates on U, and let x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn be
the symplectic coordinates on π−1
∗(U) induced by x1, . . . , xn. Set C = n
i=1 yi ∂
∂yi .
Then C is a vector ﬁeld on π−1
∗(U) and π T
∗◦C = 0, that is, C is a vertical vector
ﬁeld.1It is obvious that we can deﬁne a vector ﬁeld on P such that locally, this vector
ﬁeld has the expression given above. We again denote this vector ﬁeld by C.
Lemma 3.2.1 Keep the above notation. We have
i(C)ω = −α,
i(C)α = 0,
θ(C)α = α,
θ(C)ω = ω.
Proof To verify the ﬁrst formula, choose local symplectic coordinates x1, . . . , xn,
y1, . . . , yn such that α = n
i=1 yi d xi (see Sect.3.1) and compute directly. By using
the ﬁrst formula, we have

of any vector bundle, is often called the Liouville vector ﬁeld in other texts.

i(C)α = −i(C)2ω = −ω(C, C) = 0.
Thus the second formula holds. Then by using the already proved ﬁrst and second
formulas,
θ(C)α = d i(C)α + i(C) d α = −i(C)ω = α.
Thus proves the third formula. Finally, by using θ ◦d = d ◦θ,
θ(C)ω = −θ(C) d α = −d θ(C)α = −d α = ω.

Lemma 3.2.2 For any vector ﬁeld X on P, C fX = fX, where fX is deﬁned as in
Sect.3.1.
Proof We use formula (3.1.2). Choose local coordinates x1, . . . , xn on P and local
symplectic coordinates x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn on T ∗P, such that locally, fX =
n
i=1 ai yi, where the ai’s are the pullbacks on T ∗P of some functions on P. By
the deﬁnition of C, Cai = 0, thus
C fX =

□
Proposition 3.2.3 Let X be a symplectic vector ﬁeld on T ∗P. Then:
(1) X + [C, X] is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld and X + [C, X] = Hα(X).
(2) [C, X] is a symplectic vector ﬁeld.
Proof According to Lemma 3.2.1, θ(C)ω = ω and i(C)ω = −α, thus we have
i(X + [C, X])ω = i(X)ω + θ(C) i(X)ω −i(X)θ(C)ω
= θ(C) i(X)ω = d i(C) i(X)ω + i(C) d i(X)ω,
where in the ﬁrst step, we have used the following formula in Chap.2:
i([X, Y]) = θ(X) ◦i(Y) −i(Y) ◦θ(X).
Also, since d i(X) = θ(X) −i(X) d, and X is a symplectic vector ﬁeld, i(C) d i(X)
ω = 0. Moreover, by using the identity i(C) i(X) + i(X) i(C) = 0,
i(X + [C, X])ω = −d i(X) i(C)ω = d i(X)α = d(α(X)).
Thus X + [C, X] = Hα(X) is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld. But according to the prop-
erties of a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld (Sect.2.4), it is a symplectic vector ﬁeld, thus
[C, X] is a symplectic vector ﬁeld.

Corollary 3.2.4 (Fist corollary of Proposition 3.2.3) For any function f ∈C∞
(T ∗P), we have
α(H f ) = C f,
[C, H f ] = H(C f −f ).
Proof In fact, direct computation shows
α(H f ) = i(H f )α = −i(H f ) i(C)ω
= i(C) i(H f )ω = i(C) d f = C f.
Then by Proposition 3.2.3,
[C, H f ] = Hα(H f ) −H f = H(C f −f ).
□
Corollary 3.2.5 (Second corollary of Proposition3.2.3) For any f, g ∈C∞(T ∗P),
we have
C{ f, g} = {C f, g} + { f, Cg} −{ f, g},
where { , } is the Poisson bracket.
Proof In fact,
C{ f, g} = C(H f g) = [C, H f ]g + H f Cg = {C f, g} −{ f, g} + { f, Cg}.
□
For any integer r, let Er be the set of all functions f in C∞(T ∗P) such that
C f = (r + 1) f.
According to the deﬁnition, the elements in Er are those differentiable functions
on T ∗P whose restrictions on every ﬁber T ∗
x P are homogeneous polynomials of
degree r + 1. Thus, if r < −1, then we have Er = {0}. While the vector space E−1
is the space formed by all functions that are constants on every ﬁber, that is, the
space formed by all pullbacks of the functions of C∞(P) on T ∗P. Given any two
integers r, s, we have Er Es ⊂Er+s+1, and by second corollary of Proposition 3.2.3,
for ∀f ∈Er, ∀g ∈Es,
C{ f, g} = (r + 1){ f, g} + (s + 1){ f, g} −{ f, g} = (r + s + 1){ f, g}.
Thus {Er, Es} ⊂Er+s.
Thus, the sum of all Er is a subalgebra of C∞(T ∗P), whether for the associative
algebra structure or for the Lie algebra structure deﬁned by the Poisson bracket.
Furthermore, it is a Z-graded Lie algebra.
Let S(T ∗P, ω) be the space formed by the symplectic vector ﬁelds on the sym-
plectic manifold (T ∗P, ω). For any integer r, let Sr be the space spanned by the
symplectic vectors X in S(T ∗P, ω) such that [C, X] = r X.

Let U be an open neighborhood in P, let x1, . . . , xn be coordinates on U, and
let x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn be the symplectic coordinates on π−1

But [C, X] = r X, thus
C fi = r fi,
Cgi = (r + 1)gi,
i = 1, . . . , n.
Therefore the restrictions of fi and gi on the ﬁbers of T ∗P that contained in π−1
∗(U)
are homogeneous polynomial functions of degree r and r + 1, respectively. In par-
ticular, this shows that if r < −1, then Sr = {0}.
Proposition 3.2.6 For any r ≥−1 and any f ∈Er, we have H f ∈Sr.
Proof In fact, by the ﬁrst corollary of Proposition 3.2.3,
[C, H f ] = H(C f −f ) = Hr f = r H f .
Thus H f ∈Sr.

Proposition 3.2.7 For any integer r > −1, the map (refer to Sect.2.4)

phism is
X −→

r + 1α(X),
X ∈Sr.
Proof In fact, if f ∈Er, then α(H f ) = C f = (r + 1) f. Since r > −1, r + 1 ̸= 0,
thus this map is injective. It is also onto. This is because if X ∈Sr, then
Cα(X) = θ(C) i(X)α = i([C, X])α + i(X)θ(C)α = (r + 1)α(X),
thus α(X) ∈Er, and by Proposition 3.2.3, Hα(X) = X + [C, X] = (1 + r)X.

the deﬁnition of E−1, it is not hard to see that, the local constant function space
H 0(T ∗P, R) on T ∗P is included in E−1. By using the exact sequence (2.4.1)
{0} −→H 0(T ∗P, R) −→C∞(T ∗P)
H

Proposition 3.2.9 The sequence (3.2.1) is an exact sequence.
Proof According to Proposition 3.2.3, for any X ∈S−1, Hα(X) = 0. Thus locally,
the function α(X) is a constant. Since α is zero on the zero cross section of T ∗P,
α(X) = 0. If X ∈S−1 and the image of X in H 1(T ∗P, R) is 0, then there exists
f ∈C∞(T ∗P) such that H f = X. Furthermore, by the ﬁrst corollary of Proposition
3.2.3, C f = α(H f ) = 0. Thus, the sequence (3.2.1) is exact at S−1.
Now we show that S−1 −→H 1(T ∗P, R) is onto. Let σ be the zero cross section
of the vector bundle T ∗P. The map σ ◦π∗is homotopic to the identity map on T ∗P.
Thus the homomorphism
Hi(π∗) : Hi(P, R) −→Hi(T ∗P, R)
is in fact an isomorphism for any i. Thus each cohomology class that shows up in
H 1(T ∗P, R) contains a form r, which is the image of some closed 1-form under
the map (π∗)∗. Since C is a vertical vector ﬁeld, θ(C)r = 0. Therefore, if X is a
symplecticvectorﬁeldon T ∗P satisfyingi(X)ω = r,thensinceθ(C)ω = ω (Lemma
3.2.1),
i([C, X])ω = θ(C)r −i(X)θ(C)ω = −i(X)ω,
thus [C, X] = −X and X ∈S−1. Thus the cohomology class of r is the image of
some element of S−1. The exactness of the sequence at E−1 and H 0(T ∗P, R) are
clear.
□
Remark 3.2.10 The exact sequence (3.2.1) is isomorphic to the following exact
sequence
{0} −→H 0(P, R) −→C∞(P)
d
−→Z1(P) −→H 1(P, R) −→{0},
where Z1(P) is the space of the closed 1-forms on P, and the map Z1(P) −→
H 1(P, R) is the map that maps a closed 1-form to the cohomology class it represents.
In fact, we can deﬁne a canonical isomorphism from the space 	1(P) to the space
of vector ﬁelds on T ∗P such that for ∀Y ∈T (T ∗P), [C, Y] = −Y. To do that, for

66

any β ∈	1(P), deﬁne a vector ﬁeld Xβ on T ∗P such that i(Xβ)ω = (π∗)∗(β). This
map induces an isomorphism from Z1(P) onto S−1, denote it by ρ. Then it is not
hard to verify that the diagram below is a commutative diagram (exercise):

3.2.11 The Lie algebras E0 and S0. Let D(P) be the Lie algebra formed by the
vector ﬁelds on P. In Sect.3.1, we deﬁned a linear map from D(P) into C∞(T ∗P):
F : X −→fX,
X ∈D(P).
This is a vector space isomorphism from D(P) onto to E0.
Lemma 3.2.12 Identify C∞(P) with E−1. Then for any X ∈D(P) and any g ∈
C∞(P), { fX, g} = Xg.
Proof In fact, let x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn be local coordinates on T ∗P induced from
local coordinates on P, and let X = n
i=1 ai ∂
∂xi . Then fX = n
i=1 ai yi. Thus (see
(2.5.1))
{ fX, g} =
n

i=1

∂g
∂xi
= Xg.
□
Since {E0, E0} ⊂E0, E0 is a Lie algebra with respect to the algebra structure
deﬁned by the Poisson bracket.
Proposition 3.2.13 The isomorphism F : X −→fX from D(P) onto E0 is a Lie
algebra isomorphism.
Proof In fact, if X, Y ∈D(P), g ∈C∞(P), then
{{ fX, fY}, g} = { fX, { fY, g}} −{ fY, { fX, g}}
= X(Yg) −Y(Xg) = [X, Y]g = { f[X,Y], g},
where, as in Lemma 3.2.12, we identiﬁed C∞(P) with E−1. From the deﬁnition of
F, it can be seen that under local coordinates,
{ fX, fY} −f[X,Y] =
n

i=1
ξi
∂
∂xi
.
Thus, according to the computation above, { fX, fY} −f[X,Y] is contained in the
center of the Lie algebra C∞(T ∗P), and thus it is a local constant function on

3.2 Symplectic Vector Fields on a Cotangent Bundle
67
T ∗P. Since it is also contained in E0, it is equal to 0, that is, F is a Lie algebra
isomorphism.
□
For X ∈D(P), we deﬁne a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld T ∗(X) on T ∗P by
T ∗(X) = H fX .
According to Propositions3.2.7 and 3.2.13, the map
T ∗: X −→T ∗(X),
X ∈D(P),
is an isomorphism from the Lie algebra D(P) onto the Lie algebra S0. For any
g ∈C∞(P), we have
T ∗(X)g = H fX g = Xg,
X ∈D(P).
Thus T ∗(X) is a projectable vector ﬁeld on P, and its projection is X. We call the
vector ﬁeld T ∗(X) an extension of X on T ∗P. By the ﬁrst corollary of Proposition
3.2.3, for any X ∈D(P),
α(T ∗(X)) = C fX = fX.
Proposition 3.2.14 Let Y be a vector ﬁeld on T ∗P. Then Y is an extension of some
vector ﬁeld on P if and only if
(1) [C, Y] = 0, and
(2) θ(Y)α = 0.
Proof Assume that Y is an extension of a vector ﬁeld X on P, that is Y = T ∗(X).
Then Y ∈S0, and thus [C, Y] = 0. Also,
θ(Y)α = d i(Y)α + i(Y) d α = d(α(Y)) + i(Y) d α = d fX −i(H fX )ω = 0.
Thus the necessary part is proved. Conversely, if Y is a vector ﬁeld on T ∗P that
satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2), then (cf. the proofs of Propositions3.2.3 and 3.2.7)
Cα(Y) = (θ(C)α)(Y) + α([C, Y]) = α(Y),
thus α(Y) ∈E0. On the other hand, since θ(Y)α = 0, we have d α(Y) = i(Y)ω.
Thus Y = Hα(Y) ∈S0, and therefore Y is an extension of some vector ﬁeld on P. □
Example 3.2.15 Let x1, . . . , xn be the natural coordinates on Rn, and let x1, . . . , xn,
y1, . . . , yn be the symplectic coordinates on T ∗Rn induced by x1, . . . , xn. If X =

Remark 3.2.16 If X ∈D(P),thenanyﬂowgeneratedby T ∗(X)isasetofsymplectic
isomorphisms of T ∗P . These symplectic isomorphisms keep the Liouville form
invariant. If ϕt is a ﬂow generated by X, then it can be seen from the discussions in
Sect.3.1 that T ∗ϕt is a ﬂow on T ∗P generated by T ∗(X).
3.2.17 The spaces E1 and S1. The space E1 is spanned by those functions on T ∗P
whose restrictions on every ﬁber T ∗
x P are degree two homogeneous polynomials. If
for any x ∈P, the restriction of an element g ∈E1 on T ∗
x P is always nondegenerate,
then g can be viewed as a pseudo Riemannian metric on P, and we can use it to
deﬁne an isomorphism from the cotangent bundle T ∗P onto the tangent bundle T P
as follows. Let ξ ∈T ∗P and let π∗(ξ) = x. Deﬁne an element gξ in Tx P by
gξ : v −→g(ξ, v),
∀v ∈T ∗
x P.
Then the map
ϕ : ξ −→gξ,
ξ ∈T ∗P,
is an isomorphism from T ∗P onto T P. If T P is identiﬁed with T ∗P via the iso-
morphism ϕ, then the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Hg (∈S1) is called a spray induced
by the metric g. The geodesics on P are the projections of the orbits of Hg on P.
Note that Hgg = {g, g} = 0, it can be seen that the vector ﬁeld Hg is tangent to the
hypersurface deﬁned by the equation g = a (a ∈R).
3.3
Lagrangian Submanifolds of a Cotangent Bundle
Let P be a manifold, and let β ∈	1(P). As in Sect.3.1, we denote by β the cross
section on the cotangent bundle that corresponds to β. Then β is an immersion from
P into T ∗P.
Proposition 3.3.1 The immersion β : P −→T ∗P is a Lagrangian immersion if
and only if β is a closed 1-form.
Proof In fact, according to Proposition 3.1.3, we have β = β
∗(α), where α is the
Liouville form on T ∗P. Thus d β = β
∗(d α) = −β
∗(ω), and the immersion β is
an isotropic immersion if and only if d β = 0. Also, since dim P = 1
2 dim T ∗P, an
isotropic immersion from P into T ∗P must be a Lagrangian immersion. Therefore,
β is a Lagrangian immersion if and only if d β = 0.
□
A special case of Proposition 3.3.1 is the following: For any function f ∈C∞(P),
there exists a corresponding Lagrangian submanifold of T ∗P, that is, the image of

3.3 Lagrangian Submanifolds of a Cotangent Bundle
69
d f . We call the image of d f a Lagrangian submanifold generated by f , and call f
a generating function of this submanifold.
Let L be a Lagrangian submanifold of T ∗P, and let ξ be a point of L such that Tξ L
traverses the vertical subspace of Tξ(T ∗P). Then the map π∗: T ∗P −→P restricts
to L giving a map π∗|L = π1, whose tangent space map (π T
1 )ξ at the point ξ is a
tangent space isomorphism. Thus, it follows that there exists an open neighborhood
U of ξ in L such that the restriction map π1|U is a homeomorphism from U onto the
open set π∗(U) of P (see the ﬁgure below).
If β is a differential 1-form on π∗(U) such that the map β ◦π∗is the identity map
on U, then β is a Lagrangian immersion from π∗(U) onto U. According to Proposi-
tion 3.3.1, d β = 0. Thus there exists an open neighborhood V of the point π∗(ξ) in
P and a function f ∈C∞(V ) such that d f = β|V . Thus d f (V ) is a neighborhood
of ξ in L, and in this neighborhood, f is a generating function.
It is natural to ask, is it true that any Lagrangian submanifold in T ∗P can be
generated by a generating function locally? The answer is negative. There exist
Lagrangian submanifolds in T ∗P which are not cross sections of T ∗P, thus cannot,
even locally, be generated by some functions. For example, every ﬁber of T ∗P is a
Lagrangian submanifold of T ∗P. In fact, the pullback of the Liouville form on each
ﬁber is zero, thus the pullback of ω on each ﬁber is also zero. Since the dimension
of each ﬁber is half of the dimension of T ∗P, it is a Lagrangian submanifold. These
Lagrangian submanifolds cannot be generated by functions.
The method of constructing Lagrangian submanifolds of T ∗P by using the func-
tionsof P canbegeneralizedasfollows.Wecanassumewithoutlossofgeneralitythat
there exist global coordinates x1, . . . , xn on P, otherwise, we can consider a coordi-
nate neighborhood of P. Let x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn be the symplectic coordinates on
T ∗P induced by x1, . . . , xn. Let s be an integer, and let a1, . . . , as be the natural coor-
dinates on Rs. We consider the product manifold P × Rs. Let pr1 : P × Rs −→P
be the projection map, and let F : P × Rs −→R be a differentiable function on
P × Rs. We deﬁne a lift
γ : P × Rs −→T ∗P
of the projection pr1 such that

Then γ is a differentiable map.
Let NF be the set of points in P × Rs deﬁned by the following equations

We assume that on NF there is always

Then, NF is an n-dimensional closed submanifold of P × Rs, and the restriction of

X on P × Rs is tangent to NF at the point x is

is identically equal to s on NF. Thus the kernel of (γ |NF)T
x is the intersection of the
kernels of the 1-forms: d x1, . . . , d xn, d a1, . . . , d as. Therefore the kernel of (γ |NF)T
x
contains only the zero vector, that is, γ |NF is an immersion.
On the other hand, for the Liouville form α = n

Thus the pullback of γ ∗(α) on NF is equal to the pullback of d F on NF. Thus
γ ∗(ω)|NF = γ ∗(−d α)|NF = −d γ ∗(α)|NF = 0.
Thus the restriction of γ on NF is a Lagrangian immersion from NF into T ∗P. In
general, this immersion is not injective (see Examples 3.3.3 2 below). If it is an
injective map, then its image L is a Lagrangian submanifold of T ∗P, and α|L is an
exact 1-form. If this is case, we also call F a generating function of L.
Remark 3.3.2 Consider the restriction pr1|NF of the projection pr1 : P × Rs −→P
on NF. It is easy to see that the kernel of (pr1|NF)T is the intersection of the kernels
of the following 1-forms:

Thus it can be at most s-dimensional. If we compose the Lagrangian immersion
γ : NF −→T ∗P with the natural projection π∗: T ∗P −→P, then we obtain a
map whose rank at any point is at least n −s.
Examples 3.3.3
1. Let s = n. Let p ∈P, let the coordinate of the point p be (p1, . . . , pn), and let
F = n
i=1(xi −pi)ai. Then
NF = {p} × Rn ⊂P × Rn,
and yi ◦γ = ai, i = 1, . . . , n. That is, γ |NF is an isomorphism from NF onto the
ﬁber T ∗

2. Let P = R, let s = 1, and let
F = F(x, a) = a3

Then ∂F

We know in general that a Lagrangian submanifold of T ∗P is not necessary gen-
erated by some function of C∞(P) even locally, that is, it is not necessary the image
of some d f even locally, where f ∈C∞(P). However, if L is a closed Lagrangian
submanifold of T ∗P, then locally, it can be constructed by using the method we
have just described. In fact, let ξ ∈L be an arbitrary point. According to Proposition
2.6.4, there exist an open neighborhood U of ξ in T ∗P and symplectic coordinates
u1, . . . , un, v1, . . . , vn on U such that v1, . . . , vn are all equal to 0 on L ∩U. Accord-
ing to Lemma 2.6.2, we can assume that the coordinates u1, . . . , un, v1, . . . , vn have
the property that at any point of U,
d x1, . . . , d xn, d u1, . . . , d un
are independent, where x1, . . . , xn are coordinates on P. Let x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn
be the symplectic coordinates on P induced by x1, . . . , xn. Then since both u1, . . . ,
un, v1, . . . , vn and x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn (restricted toU) are symplectic coordinates
on U, the form
n

i=1
(yi d xi −vi d ui)
is a closed form on U. Since every closed form is exact locally, we can assume
that there exists a differentiable function F on T ∗P such that on U (shrink U if
necessary),
d F|U =

Thus on U,

i = 1, . . . , n.
Since all v1, . . . , vn are 0 on L ∩U, thus on L ∩U, ∂F

map γ is the identity map on the open set L ∩U of NF.
As explained by Weinstein in reference [29], the method of constructing a
Lagrangian submanifold by using a differentiable function on P × Rs is a special
case of another more intuitive geometric construction method. Next, we give a brief
description of this method, the reader can refer to the relevant references for more
details.
Let Q be a manifold, and let ϕ : Q −→P be a submersion. If N is the set of
the cotangent vectors of the form ξ ◦ϕT (ξ ∈T ∗P) on T ∗Q, then N is a sub-
vector bundle of T ∗Q. If dim P = n and dim Q = n + s, then dim N = 2n + s. Let
μ : N −→T ∗P be a differentiable map such that μ(η) ◦ϕT = η holds for all η ∈N.
Then it can be proved that:
1. If αP and αQ are the Liouville forms on T ∗P and T ∗Q respectively, then
αQ|N = μ∗(αP).
Also, if ωP and ωQ are symplectic structures on T ∗P and T ∗Q respectively, then
μ∗(ωP) = ωQ|N.
2. With respect to the symplectic structure ωQ, N is coisotropic.
Let F be a differentiable function on Q, and let L be the image of d F (the cross
section of T ∗Q corresponding to d F) in T ∗Q. Then L is a Lagrangian submanifold
of T ∗Q. If L and N has a “good intersection”, then a Lagrangian submanifold of
T ∗P can be constructed by using the contraction method (see Sect.2.6). For any
η ∈L ∩N, there exists an open neighborhood V of η in L ∩N such that μ(V ) is a
Lagrangian submanifold of T ∗P.

Chapter 4
Symplectic G-Spaces
In this chapter, we denote by G a Lie group, that is, G is simultaneously an abstract
group and a real analytic manifold, and the group operation of G and the analytic
structure of G are compatible. By compatible, it is meant that the map deﬁned by
(x, y) −→xy−1,
x, y ∈G,
from G × G onto G is a real analytic map.
Deﬁnition 4.0.1 Let M be a manifold. If a differentiable map γ : G × M −→M
satisﬁes the following two conditions:
(1) γ (e, x) = x, ∀x ∈M, where e is the identity of G; and
(2) if s1, s2 ∈G, then γ (s1, γ (s2, x)) = γ (s1s2, x), ∀x ∈M,
then we say that G acts differentially on M.
We usually write an action γ of G on M in a product form:
γ (s, x) = sx,
s ∈G, x ∈M.
If T (G × M) is identiﬁed with T G × T M, then the tangent space map γ T of
a differentiable action γ of G on M can be viewed as a differentiable map from
T G × T M into T M. It is easy to see that this is an action of the group T G on the
manifold T M. We also write it as a product. We identify M (or G) with the image
of the zero cross section of T M (or T G). Under these assumptions, if s ∈G, x ∈
M, a ∈TsG, and v ∈Tx M, then
sv = γ T (s, v) ∈Tsx M,
ax = γ T (a, x) ∈Tsx M.

Symplectic G-Spaces
Denote the tangent space of G at the identity e by g, then for any a ∈g and x ∈M,
we have ax ∈Tx M. The map x −→ax, x ∈M, is a vector ﬁeld on M for a ﬁxed
a, we denote it by a. In particular, if M = G and γ : G × G −→G is the product
map of the Lie group G, then for any a ∈g, a : s −→as, s ∈G, is a right invariant
vector ﬁeld on G, we use a special notation Ra to denote it. Obviously, Ra(e) = a.
Deﬁne a bracket operation [ , ] on g such that for any a, b ∈g
R[a,b] = [Ra, Rb] (= Ra Rb −RbRa),
then the vector space g becomes a real Lie algebra, we call it the Lie algebra of G.
Deﬁnition 4.0.2 Let M be a manifold, let G be a Lie group, and let h be an arbitrary
ﬁnite dimensional real Lie algebra.
(1) If G acts differentially on M, we call M a G-space.
(2) If there exists a Lie algebra homomorphism from the Lie algebra h into the Lie
algebra of vector ﬁelds on M, we call M an h-space.
IfgistheLiealgebraof G,thenforany G-space M,themap : a −→a, a ∈g,
is a homomorphism from g into the Lie algebra D(M) of vector ﬁelds on M, and thus
M is a g-space. We call this g-space structure of M the adjoint g-space structure.
Remark 4.0.3 We can also start from the left invariant vector ﬁelds on G and then
deﬁne the Lie algebra of G, there is no essential difference between the Lie algebra
of G thus deﬁned and the Lie algebra of G deﬁned by using the right invariant vector
ﬁelds.

Deﬁnitions and Examples
Deﬁnition 4.1.1 Let M be a G-space. If there exists a symplectic structure ω on M
that is invariant under the action of G, then we call M a symplectic G-space.
By this deﬁnition, if a symplectic manifold (M, ω) is a symplectic G-space, then
for any s ∈G, the diffeomorphism s : x −→sx, x ∈M, is a symplectic automor-
phism of (M, ω).
Deﬁnition 4.1.2 Let h be a ﬁnite dimensional real Lie algebra, and let M be an
h-space. If there exists a symplectic structure ω on M such that for any a ∈h, the
vector ﬁeld
a : x −→ax,
x ∈M,
is a symplectic vector ﬁeld of (M, ω), then we call the h-space M a symplectic
h-space.

Let g be the Lie algebra of a Lie group G, let M be a G-space, and let ω be a
symplectic structure on M. Since M is a G-space, M is a g-space. If (M, ω) is a
symplectic G-space, then it is also a symplectic g-space. In fact, choose an arbitrary
a ∈g, and let F : R −→G be the one parameter subgroup of G corresponding to
a, that is, F is a Lie group homomorphism from the additive real number Lie group
R into G. For any x ∈M, let
ϕ : (t, x) −→F(t)x,
t ∈R.
Then the map ϕ : R × M −→M satisﬁes the following conditions:
1. ϕ(0, x) = x, ∀x ∈M, and
2. the map: t −→ϕ(t, x), t ∈R, for any x ∈M, is an integral curve of the vector
ﬁeld
a : x −→ax,
x ∈M.
In fact, for any t ∈R, a : ϕ(t, x) −→aF(t)x. Also, since F : R −→G is the
one parameter subgroup corresponding to a, d F(t)
d t
= aF(t). Therefore
d ϕ(t, x)
d t
= d F(t)
d t
x = aF(t)x.
Thus ϕ is a ﬂow generated by a. Since ω is G-invariant, ϕ∗
t (α) does not depend
on the parameter t ∈R. According to Lemma 2.4.1, θ(a)ω = 0. That is, a is a
symplectic vector ﬁeld for any a ∈g. This proves that (M, ω) is also a symplectic
g-space. Conversely, if (M, ω) is a symplectic g-space, then when G is a connected
Lie group, (M, ω) is also a symplectic G-space.
Examples 4.1.3
1. let P be a G-space, and let γ : G × P −→P be the corresponding action. For
any s ∈G, γs : x −→sx, x ∈P, is a diffeomorphism of P. Using the notation in
Sect.3.1, the map T ∗γs : T ∗P −→T ∗P satisﬁes the relation:
⟨(T ∗γs)(ξ), γ T (u)⟩= ⟨ξ, u⟩,
∀ξ ∈T ∗
x P,
u ∈Tx P.
Thus the map
T ∗γ : (s, ξ) −→(T ∗γs)(ξ),
s ∈G,
ξ ∈T ∗P,
deﬁnes an action of G on T ∗P, which we also write in the form of a product:
T ∗γ : (s, ξ) −→sξ,
s ∈G,
ξ ∈T ∗P.
Then for any (ξ, v) ∈T ∗P ×
P T P and s ∈G, ⟨sξ, sv⟩= ⟨ξ, v⟩. Thus, the action of
G on T ∗P deﬁned above is in fact the only action that satisﬁes this equality. By

Symplectic G-Spaces
Proposition 3.1.4, we know that the Liouville form αP on T ∗P is invariant under
this action of G. Therefore, if ωP = −d αP is the canonical symplectic structure on
T ∗P, then (T ∗P, ωP) is a symplectic G-space.
2. Let ω = n
i=1 d xi ∧d xn+i be the canonical symplectic structure on R2n. Under
the natural action of the symplectic group Sp(2n), the symplectic manifold (R2n, ω)
is a symplectic Sp(2n)-space. Similarly, consider R2n as a Lie group, then under the
parallel translation action, (R2n, ω) is a symplectic R2n-space.
If (M, ω) is a symplectic G-space, then the pullback of ω on every orbit of G is
always a constant rank closed 2-form. But in the general case, this closed form is not
necessary a symplectic structure on the orbit. We have the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1.4 Let (V, ω) be a real symplectic vector space, let H be a compact
subgroup of Sp(V, ω), and let V H be the subspace of V formed by the vectors ﬁxed
by H. Then V H is a symplectic subspace of (V, ω).
Proof Let (x1, . . . , x2n) be a symplectic basis of V . Deﬁne a linear map j of V such
that
j(xi) = xn+i,
j(xn+i) = −xi,
i = 1, . . . , n.
Moreover, deﬁne a bilinear form b on V by
b(x1, x2) = ω(x1, j(x2)),
∀x1, x2 ∈V.
Then b is a positive deﬁnite symmetric bilinear form on V . Since H is a compact
subgroup of Sp(V, ω), so by the result of Sect.1.5, b is invariant under the action of
H, that is, for any s ∈H,
b(x1, x2) = b(sx1, sx2),
∀x1, x2 ∈V.
Let F be the subspace of V spanned by
{sx −x : s ∈H, x ∈V }.
Since H ⊂Sp(V, ω), thus for any x, y ∈V and s ∈H,
ω(sx −x, y) = ω(x, s−1y −y).
In particular, if y ∈V H, then ω(sx −x, y) = 0. Thus, F is the orthogonal comple-
ment of V H in V with respect to ω. Similarly, since b is invariant under H, we also
have
b(sx −x, y) = b(x, s−1y −y),
∀x, y ∈V, s ∈H.

4.1 Deﬁnitions and Examples
79
Thus, F is also orthogonal to V H with respect to b. Let the orthogonal complement
of V H in V with respect to b be (V H)⊥, then (V H)⊥= F, and V H ∩(V H)⊥=
V H ∩F = {0}. Thus V H is a symplectic subspace.
□
Proposition 4.1.5 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic G-space. If G is a compact Lie group,
then the ﬁxed point set of G:
MG = {x ∈M : sx = x, ∀s ∈G},
is a symplectic submanifold of (M, ω).
Proof Since G is compact, a G-invariant Riemannian metric g can be deﬁned on M.
For this g, we can deﬁne an exponential map on an open neighborhood U of the zero
cross section of T M (see Ref.[12]): exp : U −→M. Since g is invariant under the
action of G, thus for any s ∈G and v ∈U, exp(sv) = s(exp(v)). Let x ∈MG, and
let Wx be an open neighborhood of x in Tx M such that Wx ⊂U and the restriction
of exp on Wx is a diffeomorphism from Wx onto exp(Wx). Then
MG ∩exp(Wx) = exp((Tx M)G ∩Wx),
where (Tx M)G is the G-ﬁxed point subspace of Tx M. Thus MG is a submanifold of
M, and for any x ∈MG, Tx(MG) = (Tx M)G. Since (M, ω) is a G-space, for any
s ∈G and x ∈MG, the linear transformation of Tx M: v −→sv, v ∈Tx M, is an
element of Sp(Tx M, ωx). Thus by Lemma 4.1.4, Tx(MG) = (Tx M)G is a symplectic
subspace of (Tx M, ωx). Thus MG is a symplectic submanifold of (M, ω).

4.2
Hamiltonian g-Spaces and Moment Maps
We denote by g a ﬁnite dimensional real Lie algebra below.
Deﬁnition 4.2.1 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic g-space. If for any a ∈g, the vector
ﬁeld
a : x −→ax,
x ∈M,
is always a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld, then (M, ω) is called a Hamiltonian g-space.
If (M, ω) is a symplectic manifold, then there exists an exact sequence of Lie
algebras (2.4.1):
{0} −→H 0(M, R) −→C∞(M)
H
−→S(M, ω)
ρ
−→H 1(M, R) −→{0},
and the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds on M are exactly the symplectic vector ﬁelds
on M that belong to the image of H. Thus, a Hamiltonian g-space structure on
(M, ω) is in fact a homomorphism  : g −→S(M, ω) that satisﬁes ρ ◦ = 0. If

Symplectic G-Spaces
H 1(M, R) = {0}, then this equality always holds, and all symplectic g-structures
on (M, ω) are Hamiltonian g-space structures. Since as a Lie algebra, the bracket
operation of H 1(M, R) is the zero operation, so if [g, g] = g, then the only Lie
algebra homomorphism from g into H 1(M, R) is the zero homomorphism. Thus,
if [g, g] = g, then all symplectic structures on (M, ω) are also Hamiltonian g-space
structures.
Assume the map  : g −→S(M, ω) is a Lie algebra homomorphism. Then the
necessary and sufﬁcient condition for  to be a Hamiltonian g-structure on the
symplectic manifold (M, ω) can also be described as: there exists a linear map ˜
from g into C∞(M) such that  = H ◦˜.
If ˜ is an arbitrary linear map from g into C∞(M), then we can deﬁne a differen-
tiable map μ from M into the dual space g∗of g as follows: for any a ∈g, the value
of μ(x) (x ∈M) at a is deﬁned by ⟨μ(x), a⟩= ˜(a)(x). It is easy to see that μ(x)
is uniquely determined. Thus, we can view the image of an element a ∈g under ˜
as a function on M deﬁned by the following map:
⟨μ, a⟩: x −→⟨μ(x), a⟩,
∀x ∈M.
If  is a Hamiltonian g-space structure, then H⟨μ,a⟩= a, ∀a ∈g.
Deﬁnition 4.2.2 Let (M, ω) be a Hamiltonian g-space. We call any differentiable
map μ : M −→g∗that satisﬁes the equality H⟨μ,a⟩= a, ∀a ∈g, a moment map
of the g-space (M, ω).
Lemma 4.2.3 Let μ : M −→g∗be a moment map of a Hamiltonian g-space
(M, ω). Then the following equalities hold:
(1) d⟨μ, a⟩= ⟨d μ, a⟩= i(a)ω,
(2) ⟨d μ(ax), b⟩= ω(bx, ax),
(3) ⟨d μ(ax), b⟩= {⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩}(x),
where a, b ∈g and x ∈M are arbitrary.
Proof By the deﬁnition,
i(a)ω = i(H⟨μ,a⟩)ω = d⟨μ, a⟩= ⟨d μ, a⟩,
thus (1) holds. From (1),
⟨d μ(ax), b⟩= d⟨μ, b⟩(ax) = i(b)ω(ax) = ω(bx, ax),
thus (2) holds. Also by Lemma 2.4.10
{⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩} = ω(H⟨μ,b⟩, H⟨μ,a⟩) = ω(b, a),
thus {⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩}(x) = ω(bx, ax), and (3) holds.

4.2 Hamiltonian g-Spaces and Moment Maps
81
Let μ1 and μ2 be two moment maps of a Hamiltonian g-space (M, ω). Then for
any a ∈g, ⟨d(μ1 −μ2), a⟩= 0 always holds. Thus d(μ1 −μ2) = 0, which implies
μ1 −μ2 is a constant map locally. Therefore, the moment maps of (M, ω) differ only
by some local constants. If μ is a moment map, and ϕ : M −→g∗is a locally constant
map, then since H⟨ϕ,a⟩= 0, ∀a ∈g, we have H⟨μ+ϕ,a⟩= H⟨μ,a⟩= a, ∀a ∈g.
Thus μ + ϕ is a moment map. If (M, ω) is a connected Hamiltonian g-space, then
any two moment maps of (M, ω) differ only by a parallel translation of g∗.
Proposition 4.2.4 Let μ be a moment map of a Hamiltonian g-space (M, ω). Then
for any a, b ∈g, the function
{⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩} −⟨μ, [a, b]⟩
is a locally constant function on M.
Proof In fact, by Lemma 2.4.10,
H⟨μ,[a,b]⟩= [a,b] = [a, b] = [H⟨μ,a⟩, H⟨μ,b⟩] = H{⟨μ,a⟩,⟨μ,b⟩},
thus the statement holds.
□
According to Proposition 4.2.4, for any moment map μ of a Hamiltonian g-
space (M, ω), we can deﬁne a skew symmetric bilinear form cμ on g with values in
H 0(M, R) as follows:
cμ(a, b) = {⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩} −⟨μ, [a, b]⟩,
∀a, b ∈g.
Since the Poisson bracket satisﬁes the Jacobi identity, thus
cμ([a, b], c) + cμ([b, c], a) + cμ([c, a], b) = 0,
∀a, b, c ∈g.
View H 0(M, R) as a trivial g-module, then the above equation says that cμ is
a closed 2-cochain1on g that takes values in H 0(M, R). If μ′ = μ + ϕ is another
moment map of M, where ϕ : M −→g∗is a locally constant map, then for any
a, b ∈g,
cμ′(a, b) = cμ(a, b) −⟨ϕ, [a, b]⟩.
This says that cμ −cμ′ is the coboundary of the 1-cochain f on g that takes values
in H 0(M, R) deﬁned by the equation f (a) = ⟨ϕ, a⟩, ∀a ∈g. Thus, as an element
of H 2(g, H 0(M, R)), the cohomology class that corresponds to the closed 2-cochain
cμ does not depend on the choice of μ, it is determined by the g-space structure on
(M, ω). We denote it by c(M, ω).

Symplectic G-Spaces
Deﬁnition 4.2.5 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic g-space. If the homomorphism
 : g −→S(M, ω)
is of the form H ◦˜, where
H : C∞(M) −→S(M, ω)
is as in (2.4.1), and ˜ is a homomorphism from g into the Lie algebra C∞(M) (with
the Poisson bracket), then (M, ω) is called a Poisson g-space or a strong Hamiltonian
g-space.
In order for a symplectic g-space to be Poisson, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that
there exists a moment map μ of (M, ω) such that cμ = 0, that is, c(M, ω) is 0.
If g is a semisimple real Lie algebra, then any symplectic g-space is Poisson. In
fact, in this case, any symplectic g-space is Hamiltonian. This is so, because by the
second lemma of Whitehead (see Ref.[13]), H 2(g, R) = {0}, thus
H 2(g, H 0(M, R)) = H 2(g, R) ⊗H 0(M, R) = {0},
and so c(M, ω) = 0.
Proposition 4.2.6 Let (M, ω) be a symplectic g-space. If there exists a differential
1-form α on M such that ω = −d α and θ(a)α = 0 for any a ∈g, then (M, ω) is
a Poisson g-space.
Proof In fact, for any a ∈g we have
d(α(a)) = d i(a)α = θ(a)α −i(a) d α = i(a)ω.
Thus a is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld, and we can write  as  = H ◦˜, where ˜
is a linear map from g into C∞(M) satisfying ˜a = α(a), ∀a ∈g. Thus, by the
formulas that we quoted at the beginning of Chap.2,
˜[a,b] = i([a,b])α = i([a, b])α = θ(a) i(b)α −i(b)θ(a)α
= θ(a)α(b) = −ω(a, b) = { ˜a, ˜b},
∀a, b ∈g.
So ˜ is a Lie algebra homomorphism and (M, ω) is Poisson.
□
Corollary 4.2.7 Let P be a g-space. Denote the extension of a (a ∈g) on T ∗P by
T ∗(a), then the map
∗: a −→T ∗(a),
a ∈g,
is a Poisson g-space structure on the cotangent bundle T ∗P.
Proof Use Proposition 3.2.14 and Proposition 4.2.6.

4.2 Hamiltonian g-Spaces and Moment Maps
83
Examples 4.2.8
1. Let g = R2, let x, y be the natural coordinates on R2, and deﬁne the bracket
operation on g to be the zero operation. Deﬁne a symplectic g-space structure on
(R2, d x ∧d y) by using the equation
(a,b) = a ∂
∂x + b ∂
∂y ,
a, b ∈R.
Then because (a,b) = Hay−bx, this is a Hamiltonian g-space structure. The map
from g = R2 into g∗= R2 deﬁned by the equation μ(x, y) = (y, −x) is a moment
map. For arbitrary (a1, b1), (a2, b2) ∈g, we have
cμ((a1, b1), (a2, b2)) = {⟨μ, (a1, b1)⟩, ⟨μ, (a2, b2)⟩}
= ω((a2,b2), (a1,b1)) = a2b1 −a1b2.
This is because g is an commutative Lie algebra. Also, cμ is independent of the
choice of the moment map, thus cμ is nonzero, and the g-space (R2, d x ∧d y) is not
Poisson.
2. Let ω = n
i=1 d xi ∧d xn+i be the canonical symplectic structure on R2n, and take
the skew symmetric bilinear form ω0 = n
i=1 xi ∧xn+i on R2n.
For any endomorphism a of R2n, let a be a linear vector ﬁeld on R2n such that
for any linear form f on R2n, a f = f ◦a. Then for arbitrary a, b ∈End(R2n) and
f ,
[a, b] f = ab f −ba f = f ◦b ◦a −f ◦a ◦b = (b◦a−a◦b) f,
thus [a, b] = (b◦a−a◦b). For any endomorphism a of R2n, by the deﬁnition of a,
i(a)ω =
n

i=1
((xi ◦a) d xn+i −(xn+i ◦a) d xi).
Since d i(a)ω = θ(a)ω, thus i(a)ω is a closed 1-form if and only if a belongs
to the Lie algebra sp(2n) of the symplectic group Sp(2n), that is, for arbitrary
x, y ∈R2n (cf. Sect.1.4),
ω0(a(x), y) + ω0(x, a(y)) = 0.
Thus the map  : a −→a, a ∈sp(2n), deﬁnes a symplectic sp(2n)-space struc-
ture on (R2n, ω). Since sp(2n) is a real semisimple Lie algebra,  is also a Hamil-
tonian sp(2n)-space structure and a Poisson sp(2n)-space structure. Let e1, . . . , e2n
be the natural coordinates on R2n. Then for any a ∈sp(2n),

This also proved directly that (R2n, ω) is a Hamiltonian sp(2n)-space. Also, we
have a quadratic moment map μ : R2n −→(sp(2n))∗, such that for any x ∈R2n,
⟨μ(x), a⟩= ω0(ax, x).
3. Let Q = R3 be the 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and let q1, q2, q3 be the natural
coordinates on Q. Then there are the following coordinates on the tangent bundle
T Q (see 2.4.4 Example 1):
q1, q2, q3, ˙q1 = d q1, ˙q2 = d q2, ˙q3 = d q3.
If we identify T Q with T ∗Q via the Riemannian metric 
i d q2
i , then the Liouville
form on T ∗Q can be written as αQ = 3
i=1 ˙qi d qi. Take the symplectic structure
−m d αQ on T Q, where m ∈R. Let gl(3) be the Lie algebra formed by the endo-
morphisms of Q, then we have a natural gl(3)-space structure on Q. For arbitrary
a ∈gl(3), we have
a =
3

i=1
(qi ◦a) ∂
∂qi
.
By the corollary of Proposition 4.2.6, for any a ∈gl(3), there exists an extension
T ∗(a) of a in T ∗Q = T Q, and a Poisson space structure can be deﬁned on
(T Q, −m d αQ) such that
i(T ∗(a))(−m d αQ) = m d i(T ∗(a))αQ = m d

(qi ◦a)qi,
∀a ∈gl(3).
If we only consider the Lie algebra so(3) of the orthogonal group of Q, that is,
consider only the set of elements of gl(3) of the form

⎠,
a1, a2, a3 ∈R,
then we have a Poisson so(3)-space structure on T Q, and for any a ∈so(3),
⟨μ, a⟩= m(a1(q2q3 −q3q2) + a2(q3q1 −q1q3) + a3(q1q2 −q2q1)).

Where the coefﬁcients of ai (i = 1, 2, 3) are the so-called components of the kinetic
torque. Kinetic torque means the torque of a particle of mass m, whose position and
speed can be represented by a point in T Q, about the origin. The term moment map
we adopted comes from this special case.
4. Let z j = x j + ixn+ j, j = 1, . . . , n, be the natural coordinates on Cn, and let G =
T n be the subgroup of U(n) formed by the diagonal matrices of the form:

a1, . . . , an ∈R.
Then the Lie algebra of G can be identiﬁed with the Lie algebra Rn with the
zero bracket. Corresponding to the natural action of G on Cn, there exists an
adjoint g-space structure on the manifold Cn (g = Rn is the Lie algebra of G).
If a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈g, then
a =

If we take the symplectic structure ω = n

invariant under the action of U(n), it is invariant under the action of G. For any
a ∈g, we have

z = (z1, . . . , zn) ∈Cn.

Symplectic G-Spaces
Thus θ(a)α = d i(a)α −i(a)ω = 0. Therefore by Proposition 4.2.6, (Cn, ω) is
a Poisson g-space.
Proposition 4.2.9 Let (M, ω) be a Hamiltonian g-space, and let μ : M −→g∗be
a moment map of (M, ω). Then for any x ∈M, the kernel of d μx is the orthogo-
nal complement of the subspace gx = {ax : a ∈g} in the symplectic vector space
(Tx M, ωx) with respect to ωx. In order for μ to be an immersion at the point x, it is
necessary and sufﬁcient that gx = Tx M.
Proof By Lemma 4.2.3, for any a ∈g and v ∈Tx M, ⟨d μ(v), a⟩= ω(ax, v), thus
the proposition holds.
□
If a g-space structure on (M, ω) is the adjoint structure of some symplectic G-
space structure, then the space gx is the tangent space at x of the orbit G(x) of the
point x. In order for gx = Tx M, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that the orbit G(x) is an
open subset of M. In order for a point x ∈M to be a stationary point of the moment
map μ, that is d μx = 0, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that gx = {0}. If gx = {0},
then the point x is a ﬁxed point of the identity component of G. Thus the moment
map is a constant map on any connected submanifold of M that is formed by the
ﬁxed points of G.
Proposition 4.2.10 Let (M, ω) be a Hamiltonian g-space, and let μ : M −→g∗be
a moment map. Then for any x ∈M, the image of d μx in g∗is the annihilator of
gx = {a ∈g : ax = 0},
i.e., the vector subspace of g∗formed by all vectors that vanish on gx. In order for μ
to be a submersion at the point x, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that gx = {0}.
Proof As in the proof of Proposition 4.2.9, the proposition can be proved by using
⟨d μ(v), a⟩= ω(ax, v).
□
If a g-space structure is the adjoint structure of some symplectic G-space, then
gx is the Lie algebra of the isotropy subgroup of the point x:
Gx = {s ∈G : sx = x}.
In order for gx = {0}, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that Gx is a discrete subgroup of
G.
Remark 4.2.11 Let G be a compact Lie group, and let (M, ω) be a connected Hamil-
tonian G-space. Then the set formed by all those points x on M such that their G
orbits G(x) have maximal dimensions is a dense open subset of M, let it be U. Then
any moment map of (M, ω) has constant rank on U, its rank is equal to the dimension
of the orbits of the points in U. If G is also commutative, and its action on M is

effective, then for any x ∈U dim G(x) = dim G. Thus the restrictions on U of the
moment maps of (M, ω) are submersions (cf. Example 1 and Example of 4.2.8).
If G is a connected compact commutative Lie group (that is, a torus), and (M, ω) is
a connected compact Hamiltonian G-space, then the ﬁxed point set MG of G has only
ﬁnitely many connected components, let them be K1, . . . , Ks. If μ is a moment map
of (M, ω), then it is constant on each Ki. It can be proved that in this case (see Refs.

in g∗.

Equivariance of Moment Maps
Let G be a Lie group and let g be the Lie algebra of G. Let Ad be the usual adjoint
representation of G on g, that is
Ad(s)a = sas−1,
s ∈G, a ∈g.
Let ad be the adjoint representation of g on g, that is
ad(a)b = [a, b],
a, b ∈g.
We deﬁne a coadjoint representation Ad∗of G on g∗as follows:
Ad∗(s) = t Ad(s−1),
s ∈G.
Since the bracket of g is deﬁned by using the bracket of the right invariant vector
ﬁelds on G, thus
Ad(exp a) = exp(−ad(a)),
∀a ∈g,
where exp denotes the exponential map of G. Thus
Ad∗(exp a) = exp(t(ad(a)),
∀a ∈g.
Let (M, ω) be a symplectic G-space. If the adjoint g-space structure is Hamilto-
nian (or Poisson), then we call (M, ω) a Hamiltonian (or Poisson) G-space.
If M is a G-space and s ∈G, we denote by sM the diffeomorphism x −→sx, x ∈
M, from M onto itself.
Lemma 4.3.1 Let (M, ω) be a Hamiltonian G-space and let μ : M −→g∗be a
moment map. Then for any s ∈G, the map
μ ◦sM −Ad∗(s) ◦μ : M −→g∗
is a locally constant map.

Symplectic G-Spaces
Proof For any a ∈g,
d⟨Ad∗(s) ◦μ, a⟩= ⟨Ad∗(s) d μ, a⟩= ⟨d μ, Ad(s−1)a⟩.
Also, by (1) of Lemma 4.2.3, for any x ∈M and v ∈Tx M, we have
⟨d μ(v), Ad(s−1)a⟩= ω(s−1asx, v) = ω(asx, sv)
= ⟨d μ(sv), a⟩= (d⟨μ ◦sM, a⟩)(v).
Thus for any a ∈g,
d⟨Ad∗(s) ◦μ, a⟩= ⟨d(μ ◦sM), a⟩,
and therefore the map μ ◦sM −Ad∗(s) ◦μ is locally constant.
□
Proposition 4.3.2 Let (M, ω) be a connected Hamiltonian G-space and let μ :
M −→g∗be a moment map of (M, ω). Then we have:
(1) For any s ∈G, ϕμ(s) = μ(sx) −Ad∗(s)μ(x) is an element of g∗independent
of the point x ∈M.
(2) For any s, t ∈G, ϕμ(st) = ϕμ(s) + Ad∗(s)ϕμ(t).
(3) For any a, b ∈g, cμ(a, b) = ⟨d ϕμ(a), b⟩, where cμ is deﬁned as in Sect.4.2.
Proof Since M is connected, (1) can be proved by using Lemma 4.3.1. By (1),
ϕμ(st) = μ(stx) −Ad∗(st)μ(x)
= ϕμ(s) + Ad∗(s)μ(tx) −Ad∗(s) Ad∗(t)μ(x)
= ϕμ(s) + Ad∗(s)ϕμ(t),
∀s, t ∈G,
thus (2) holds. Differentiate the formula that deﬁnes ϕμ to get
d μ(ax) = t ad(a)μ(x) + d ϕμ(a),
x ∈M, a ∈g.
Thus for arbitrary x ∈M and a, b ∈g,
⟨dμ(ax), b⟩= ⟨μ(x), [a, b]⟩+ ⟨d ϕμ(a), b⟩.
But by Lemma 4.2.3,
⟨dμ(ax), b⟩= {⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩}(x).
Thus
cμ(a, b) = {⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩} −⟨μ, [a, b]⟩= ⟨d ϕμ(a), b⟩,
∀a, b ∈g.

4.3 Equivariance of Moment Maps

Corollary 4.3.3 The map from G × g∗into g∗deﬁned by
(s, ξ) −→sξ = Ad∗(s)ξ + ϕμ(s),
s ∈G, ξ ∈g∗,
is an afﬁne action of the Lie group G on the vector space g∗. For this G-space
structure of g∗, the moment map μ : M −→g∗is G-equivariant, that is,
μ(sx) = sμ(x) = Ad∗(s)μ(x) + ϕμ(s),
∀s ∈G, x ∈M.
Proof Let e be the identity of G, then by deﬁnition,
(e, ξ) −→eξ = Ad∗(e)ξ + ϕμ(e)
= ξ + μ(x) −μ(x) = ξ,
∀ξ ∈g∗,
also from formula (2) of the proposition,
(s1s2)ξ = Ad∗(s1s2)ξ + ϕμ(s1s2)
= Ad∗(s1) Ad∗(s2)ξ + ϕμ(s1) + Ad∗(s1)ϕμ(s2)
= Ad∗(s1)(Ad∗(s2)ξ + ϕμ(s2)) + ϕμ(s1)
= s1(s2ξ),
∀s1, s2 ∈G, ξ ∈g∗.
Thus the ﬁrst half of the corollary holds. While the second half comes from the
deﬁnition of ϕμ.
□
Remark 4.3.4 Proposition 4.3.2 shows that ϕμ is a closed 1-cochain on G with values
in g∗. These closed cochains deﬁned by the moment maps form a special class of
closed cochains (see Sect.5.3). Generally speaking, an action of G on g∗cannot be
obtained from some moment map even if its linear part is Ad∗.
Proposition 4.3.5 Let (M, ω) be a connected Hamiltonian G-space. A sufﬁcient
condition for (M, ω) to be a Poisson space is that there exists a moment map μ of
(M, ω) such that for any s ∈G, μ ◦sM = Ad∗(s) ◦μ. If G is connected, then this
condition is also necessary.
Proof In fact, if there exists a moment map μ of M such that μ ◦sM = Ad∗(s) ◦
μ, ∀s ∈G, then for any s ∈G, ϕμ(s) = 0. Thus by part (3) of Proposition 4.3.2,
cμ = 0. Thus (M, ω) is a Poisson G-space. Conversely, if (M, ω) is a Poisson G-
space, then there exists a moment map μ of (M, ω) such that cμ = 0. By part (3) of
Proposition 4.3.2, d ϕμ(a) = 0, ∀a ∈g. Then, by part (2) of Proposition 4.3.2,
d ϕμ(sa) = Ad∗(s) d ϕμ(a) = 0
holds for arbitrary s ∈G and a ∈g, thus d ϕμ = 0. If G is connected, then the map
ϕμ is a constant value map. But by part (2) of Proposition 4.3.2, if e is the identity
of G, then

90
4
Symplectic G-Spaces
ϕμ(e) = ϕμ(ee) = ϕμ(e) + Ad∗(e)ϕμ(e) = 2ϕμ(e).
Thus ϕμ(e) = 0, which implies ϕμ = 0 and μ ◦sM = Ad∗(s) ◦μ.
□
Remark 4.3.6
1. If G is a commutative Lie group, then for any s ∈G, Ad∗(s) = id. Thus, for
any moment map μ, ϕμ is always a differentiable homomorphism from G into the
additive group g∗. If further G is compact and connected (that is, G is a torus), then
ϕμ = 0 and
μ(sx) = μ(x),
∀s ∈G, x ∈M.
Since a moment map is constant on each G orbit, for any x ∈M,
gx = {ax : a ∈g} ⊂ker d μx.
By Proposition 4.2.9, ker d μx = (gx)⊥. Thus the orbits of G are isotropic subman-
ifolds.
2. Let (M, ω) be a homogeneous Hamiltonian G-space, that is, for any two points
x1 and x2 of M, there exists an element s of G such that sx1 = x2 (G acts transitively
on M). If μ is a moment map of M, then by Proposition 4.2.9, μ is an immersion.
By the corollary of Proposition 4.3.2, in this case, the map μ : M −→μ(M) is a
covering of an orbit of the afﬁne action of G on g∗(deﬁned by μ).

The Schouten–Nijenhuis Bracket
Let M be a manifold. Denote the degree p skew symmetric contravariant differen-
tiable tensor ﬁeld space on M by Dp(M). Then each space Dp(M) is a differentiable
cross section space of the vector bundle p T M. We have D0(M) = C∞(M). With
the operation deﬁned by the wedge product ∧,
D∗(M) =

Dp(M)
is a Z-graded associative algebra. For any u ∈Dp(M) and v ∈Dq(M), the wedge
product ∧satisﬁes the Z2-commutative law: u ∧v = (−1)pqv ∧u.
We deﬁne a bracket [ , ] on D∗(M), that is, a bilinear map
[ , ] : D∗(M) × D∗(M) −→D∗(M),
(u, v)
−→[u, v],
u, v ∈D∗(M),

where f, g ∈D0(M) = C∞(M) and X1, . . . , X p, Y1, . . . , Yq ∈D1(M), are all ar-
bitrary, and the notation ˆX means X is deleted. The bracket thus deﬁned is unique,
and we call it the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket (see Ref.[20]). Its restriction to
D1(M) × D1(M) agrees with the usual bracket on the vector ﬁelds. If X is a vector
ﬁeld and f ∈D0(M), then [X, f ] = X f.
For any integers p, q ≥0, if u ∈Dp(M) and v ∈Dq(M), then
[u, v] ∈Dp+q−1(M),
and [u, v] = −(−1)(p−1)(q−1)[v, u].
For any u ∈Dp(M), the map
ad u : v −→[u, v],
v ∈D∗(M),
is a Z2-derivation of degree p −1 of the graded associative algebra D∗(M), that is,
for any v ∈Dq(M) and w ∈D∗(M),
[u, v ∧w] = [u, v] ∧w + (−1)(p−1)qv ∧[u, w].
Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket satisﬁes a sign change Jacobi identity:
[u, [v, w]] = [[u, v], w] + (−1)(p−1)(q−1)[v, [u, w]],
∀u ∈Dp(M), v ∈Dq(M), w ∈D∗(M).
Shift the gradation of D∗(M) by 1, that is, deﬁne the degree of the elements in
Dp(M) to be p −1, then we obtain a Lie superalgebra structure on D∗(M). This is
a Z-graded algebra (see Deﬁnition 2.2.2).
If u ∈Dp(M) and f ∈D0(M), then −[ f, u] = i(d f )u.
Let p > 0. If for a collection of f1, . . . , fn ∈C∞(M) such that d f1, . . . , d fn
generate the module 1(M) of 1-forms, we have [ fi, u] = 0, i = 1, . . . , n, then
u = 0.
In the discussions that follow, w always denotes an element in D2(M), unless
stated otherwise, w is assumed to be ﬁxed.
By the properties of Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket, for any f ∈C∞(M),
H f := [ f, w] = [w, f ].
Thus the map
H : f −→H f ,
f ∈C∞(M),
is a linear map from C∞(M) into the vector ﬁeld space D1(M). Also, for any X ∈
D1(M) and f ∈C∞(M),
[X, H f ] = [X, [ f, w]] = [X f, w] + [ f, [X, w]].

Thus
[X, H f ] = HX f + [ f, [X, w]].

{ , } : C∞(M) × C∞(M) −→C∞(M)
by
{ f, g} = H f g

∀f, g ∈C∞(M).
Then for any f, g, h ∈C∞(M),
{ f, gh} = { f, g}h + g{ f, h}.
(5.1.3)
Since for any f, g ∈C∞(M), [ f, g] = 0,
{ f, g} + {g, f } = [H f , g] −[ f, Hg]
= [[w, f ], g] −[ f, [w, g]] = [w, [ f, g]] = 0.
Thus
{ f, g} = −{g, f }.
(5.1.4)
If X, Y are two vector ﬁelds on M, then for any f ∈C∞(M) and α ∈1(M),
⟨α, [ f, X ∧Y]⟩= ⟨α, [X ∧Y, f ]⟩= ⟨α, (Y f )X −(X f )Y⟩= ⟨α ∧d f, X ∧Y⟩.
Thus for any f ∈C∞(M) and α ∈1(M),
⟨α, [ f, w]⟩= ⟨α ∧d f, w⟩.
(5.1.5)
Thus for any f, g ∈C∞(M),
{ f, g} = [ f, w]g = ⟨d g, [ f, w]⟩= ⟨d g ∧d f, w⟩,
that is
{ f, g} = ⟨d g ∧d f, w⟩.

Lemma 5.1.2 The following conditions are equivalent:
(1) For any f, g, h ∈C∞(M), { f, {g, h}} + {g, {h, f }} + {h, { f, g}} = 0.
(2) For any f, g ∈C∞(M), H{ f,g} = [H f , Hg].
(3) For any f ∈C∞(M), [H f , w] = 0.
(4) [w, w] = 0.
Proof Compute directly,
{ f, {g, h}} + {g, {h, f }} + {h, { f, g}} = H f (Hgh) + Hg(−H f h) −H{ f,g}h
= [H f , Hg]h −H{ f,g}h.
Thus (1) and (2) are equivalent.
If f ∈C∞(M), then [H f , w] ∈D2(M). If [g, [H f , w]] = 0 for any g ∈C∞(M),
then [H f , w] = 0. From
[H f , Hg] −H{ f,g} = [H f , [g, w]] −[H f g, w] = [g, [H f , w]],
it follows that (2) and (3) are equivalent. Finally, from the equality
[ f, [w, w]] = [[ f, w], w] −[w, [ f, w]] = 2[[ f, w], w] = 2[H f , w],
it follows that (3) and (4) are equivalent.
□
Remark 5.1.3 Let B ⊂C∞(M) be a collection of functions such that the differen-
tials of the functions of B generate the module 1(M) (for example, the collection
formed by the coordinate functions of M). Then (1), (2), and (3) of Lemma 5.1.2
only need to hold for the functions f, g, h in B. If [w, w] = 0, then by (5.1.4) and
Lemma 5.1.2, the bracket { , } deﬁnes a Lie algebra structure on C∞(M). If M is a
symplectic manifold and w = ω, formula (5.1.3) shows that the action of this bracket
on the product of the functions in C∞(M) is the same as the Poisson bracket.
Deﬁnition 5.1.4 Let M be a manifold, and let w be a degree 2 skew symmetric
contravariant tensor on M. If w satisﬁes [w, w] = 0, then w is called a Poisson
structure on M. If w is a Poisson structure on M, then (M, w) is called a Poisson
manifold.
Any Poisson structure w on M deﬁnes a bracket { , }w on C∞(M). Let (M1, w1)
and (M2, w2) be two Poisson manifolds, and let ϕ : M1 −→M2 be a differentiable
map. If for any f, g ∈C∞(M2),
ϕ∗{ f, g}w2 = {ϕ∗( f ), ϕ∗(g)}w1,

5.1 The Structure of a Poisson Manifold
95
then ϕ is called a homomorphism from (M1, w1) into (M2, w2).
Remark 5.1.5 If w is a Poisson structure on a manifold M, then for any f ∈C∞(M),
by Lemma 5.1.2, [H f , w] = 0. This equality shows that the diffeomorphism ﬂows
on M generated by the vector ﬁeld H f keeps the tensor w invariant.
5.2
The Leaves of a Poisson Manifold
Let w be a Poisson structure on a manifold M. For any x ∈M, deﬁne a linear map
γx : T ∗
x M −→Tx M,
such that for any ξ, η ∈T ∗
x M, ⟨ξ, γx(η)⟩= ⟨ξ ∧η, wx⟩. Denote the image of γx by
Lx. Then for any x ∈M, Lx is a vector subspace of Tx M, its dimension is equal
to the rank of wx. In general, the dimension of Lx depends on the point x, but it is
always an even number. We keep the notation of Sect.5.1.
Lemma 5.2.1 For any f ∈C∞(M) and x ∈M, H f (x) ∈Lx.
Proof In fact, by (5.1.6), for any g ∈C∞(M),
(H f g)(x) = { f, g}(x) = ⟨d g ∧d f, w⟩(x) = ⟨d g, γx(d fx)⟩,
thus H f (x) = γx(d fx) ∈Lx.
□
Iftherankofw isalwaysequalto2p on M,thenforany x ∈M,thevectorspace Lx
is a ﬁber of the differentiable subbundle of T M generated by all H f ( f ∈C∞(M)).
In particular, if f1, . . . , fn ∈C∞(M) are independent on some neighborhood of a
point x ∈M, then for any point y in this neighborhood, L y is always generated by
H fi(y), i = 1, . . . , n, as a vector subspace of Ty M. Since for any f, g ∈C∞(M), by
Lemma 5.1.2,
[H f , Hg] = H{ f,g},
the vector subbundle of T M generated by all H f , denoted by L, is an integrable
subbundle of T M. Thus, M is the union set of the integrable leaves of L. That
is, M is the union set of those submanifolds F such that Tx F = Lx, ∀x ∈F, and
with respect to the set inclusion relation, they are the maximal ones among the
submanifolds of M that satisfy this relation (see Ref.[4]).
Similarly, in the cases where the ranks of w are not constant, we also call any
maximal submanifold F of M that satisﬁes the relation Tx F = Lx, ∀x ∈F, a leaf
of the Poisson manifold (M, w).
Proposition 5.2.2 Let F be a leaf of a Poisson manifold (M, w). Then there exists
a unique 2-form ωF ∈2(F) such that for any f, g ∈C∞(M),

96
5
Poisson Manifolds
ωF(H f |F, Hg|F) = {g, f }|F.
Furthermore, ωF is a symplectic structure on F, and for any f ∈C∞(M), H f |F is
the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld on F corresponding to the function f |F.
Proof For any x ∈F and any ξ, η ∈T ∗
x M, according to the deﬁnition of γx, we have
⟨ξ ∧η, wx⟩= ⟨ξ, γx(η)⟩= −⟨η, γx(ξ)⟩.
Thus, if at least one of ξ and η belongs to the kernel of the map γx : T ∗
x M −→Tx M,
then ⟨ξ ∧η, wx⟩= 0. Since Lx is the image of γx, we can deﬁne a skew symmetric
bilinear form ωx on Lx as follows. For any u, v ∈Lx, let
u = γx(ξ),
v = γx(η),
ξ, η ∈T ∗
x M,
then the value of ωx at (u, v) is deﬁned by
ωx(γx(ξ), γx(η)) = ⟨ξ ∧η, wx⟩.
Thenthisvalueisindependentofthechoicesofξ, η,anditonlydependsonu = γx(ξ)
and v = γx(η). Since for any x ∈F, Lx = Tx F, there exists a unique differential
2-form ωF such that for any x ∈F, (ωF)x = ωx. In fact, by (5.1.6), for any f, g ∈
C∞(M), we have
ωF(H f |F, Hg|F) = ⟨d f ∧d g, w⟩|F = { f, g}|F.
Since the module of the vector ﬁelds on F is generated by the vector ﬁelds of the form
H f |F ( f ∈C∞(M)), thus the above equality determines ωF uniquely. In addition,
the equality shows that ωF is a differential form, that is ωF ∈2(F). For any x ∈M,
by the deﬁnition of γx, ker γx is the kernel of the bilinear form
b : (ξ, η) −→⟨ξ ∧η, wx⟩,
ξ, η ∈T ∗
x M.
Thus the rank of ωF is always equal to dim F = dim Lx at any point x of F.
Next we prove that ωF is a closed differential form. Choose arbitrary f, g, h ∈
C∞(M). To simplify our notation, write H f , H g, H h for the restrictions of H f ,
Hg, Hh on F respectively. Then
(θ(H f )ωF)(Hg, Hh) = H f ωF(H g, Hh) −ωF([H f , H g], Hh) −ωF(H g, [H f , Hh])
= { f, {h, g}} −{h, { f, g}} −{{ f, h}, g} = 0.
Thus for any f ∈C∞(M), we have θ(H f )ωF = 0. On the other had, for any f, g ∈
C∞(M) we have
(i(H f )ωF)(H g) = {g, f }|F = (d f (Hg))|F.

5.2 The Leaves of a Poisson Manifold
97
Thus for any f ∈C∞(M),
i(H f )ωF = (d f )|F = d( f |F).
(5.2.1)
Thus
i(H f ) d ωF = θ(H f )ωF = 0,
∀f ∈C∞(M).
Since the set of all H f , f ∈C∞(M), generates the module of vector ﬁelds on F,
the above equality shows that d ωF = 0, that is, ωF is closed. We have proved that
ωF is a symplectic structure on the leaf F. Furthermore, equality (5.2.1) shows that
H f is the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld on F corresponding to the function f |F.
□
Corollary 5.2.3 Let (M, w) be a Poisson manifold. Then we have
{ f, g}|F = { f |F, f |F}F,
∀f, g ∈C∞(M),
where the bracket on the left hand side is the Poisson bracket on M deﬁned by w,
while the bracket on the right hand side is the Poisson bracket on the leaf F deﬁned
by the symplectic structure ωF.
Proof In fact, { f, g}|F = ωF(H f |F, Hg|F) = { f |F, g|F}F.
□
If w is a Poisson structure on a manifold M such that its rank is always equal
to dim M, then L = T M, and M is the only leaf of the Poisson manifold (M, w).
Thus ωM is a symplectic structure on M. The bracket operation deﬁned by this
symplectic structure is the same as the bracket operation deﬁned by the Poisson
structure. Conversely, if ω is a symplectic structure on M, then it can be used to
deﬁne an isomorphism from T M onto T ∗M:
ϕ : v −→i(v)ω,
v ∈T M.
Thus induces an isomorphism from D2(M) onto 2(M). Under this isomorphism,
the inverse image of ω is a Poisson structure w on M whose rank is always equal to
dim M, and the symplectic structure on the leaf M induced by w coincides with ω.
Thus, symplectic structures are special cases of Poisson structures. The corollary
of Proposition 5.2.2 shows that, for any leaf F of a Poisson manifold (M, w), the in-
clusion map i : F −→M is a Poisson manifold homomorphism (choose the Poisson
structure on F deﬁned by the symplectic structure ωF).
It can be proved (see Ref.[15]), that any Poisson manifold is the union set of its
integrable leaves.1
1Added by the authors of the Forewords. Even when the distribution L is not of constant rank, it is
completely integrable in a generalized sense. Its maximal integral manifolds, called here the leaves
of the Poisson manifold (M, w), are called, in other texts, the symplectic leaves of that Poisson
manifold. The leaves of (M, w) are in general immersed, not embedded, submanifolds of M. The
proof that for each point x ∈M there exists a unique symplectic leaf which contains that point can

Poisson Manifolds
Example 5.2.4 Let X, Y be two vector ﬁelds on a manifold M, and let w = X ∧Y ∈
D2(M). Then
[w,w] = [X ∧Y, X ∧Y] = X ∧[Y, X] ∧Y + Y ∧[X, Y] ∧X = 2[X, Y] ∧X ∧Y.
If [X, Y] = 0, then (M, w) is a Poisson manifold. If this is the case, for any f, g ∈
C∞(M),
{ f, g} = (Y f )(Xg) −(X f )(Yg),
and
H f = (Y f )X −(X f )Y.
In general, there exist two types of leaves on M: the leaves that degenerate to points
and the 2-dimensional leaves. The ﬁrst type of leaves are the points x ∈M such that
(X ∧Y)x = 0, and the second type of leaves form a foliation on the open set
U = {x ∈M : (X ∧Y)x ̸= 0}
of M.

In this section, we denote by g an n-dimensional real Lie algebra, and denote by
(a1, . . . , an) a basis of g. We identify g with its double dual (g∗)∗, then we can view
the space g as a subspace of C∞(g∗), and view a1, . . . , an as coordinates on g∗. Let

To avoid notation confusions, we use [ , ]S to denote the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket
in D∗(g∗), and still use [ , ] to denote g’s own bracket.
Lemma 5.3.1 The tensor w deﬁned by formula (5.3.1) is a Poisson structure on g∗.2
Furthermore, for the Poisson bracket { , } on C∞(g∗) deﬁned by w and any b, c ∈g,
{b, c} = [[w, b]S, c]S = [b, c].
be done either by working with local quotients of that Poisson manifold, or by application of a
generalization of Frobenius’ theorem proven around 1973 independently by P. Stefan (Integrability
of systems of vectorﬁelds, J. London Math. Soc., 2–21(3), pp. 544–556, 1980) and H. Sussmann

Soc., 79(1):197–199, 1973).
2Added by the authors of the Forewords. This Poisson structure which exists on the dual space of a
Lie algebra was noticed by Sophus Lie and rediscovered, much later, independently by A. Kirillov,
B. Kostant and J.-M. Souriau. It is often called the canonical Lie-Poisson structure, or the Kirillov-
Kostant-Souriau structure.

Proof Let (ξ1, . . . , ξn) be the basis of g∗dual to (a1, . . . , an). Then for any b ∈g,

Thus for any b, c ∈g,
{b, c} = [[w, b]S, c]S = [b, c].
Then the Jacobi identity of g shows that { , } also satisﬁes the Jacobi identity, thus
Lemma 5.1.2 and the remark after it show that [w, w]S = 0. So w is a Poisson
structure on g∗.
□
We can characterize the tensor w by using the following condition (cf. (5.1.6)):
for any b, c ∈g,
⟨d b ∧d c, w⟩= [c, b].
Thus w does not depend on the choice of the basis (a1, . . . , an), and we call it the
canonical Poisson structure on g∗.
Let g1, g2 be two Lie algebras, and let ψ : g1 −→g2 be a Lie algebra homomor-
phism. If we choose canonical Poisson structures on both g∗
1 and g∗
2, then the map
ψt : g∗

1 deﬁned by
⟨ψ(a), ξ⟩=

a, ψt(ξ)

,
∀a ∈g1, ξ ∈g∗
2,
is a Poisson manifold homomorphism. In particular, if g is the Lie algebra of a Lie
group G, then the canonical Poisson structure on g∗is invariant under the coadjoint
representation of G.
Proposition 5.3.2 Let g be the Lie algebra of a Lie group G and assume that G is
connected. Then all the orbits of the coadjoint representation of G are all the leaves
of g∗with respect to the canonical Poisson structure.
Proof For arbitrary a, b ∈g and ξ ∈g∗, we have
b(Ad∗(exp(ta))ξ) =

exp(t(ad(ta))ξ, b

= ⟨ξ, b⟩+ t ⟨ξ, [a, b]⟩+ t2(· · · ).
For a ∈g, let a be the vector ﬁeld on g∗that corresponds to a under the coadjoint
action of G:
a : ξ −→aξ,
ξ ∈g∗.

Poisson Manifolds
Then for any b ∈g (view b as a function on g∗), ab = [a, b]. But from Lemma
5.3.1,
[a, b] = {a, b} = Hab.
Thus for any a ∈g, a = Ha. For any ξ ∈g∗, the vector space Lξ formed by all
vectors of the form H f (ξ), f ∈C∞(g∗), coincides with the vector space formed by
all vectors of the form a(ξ), a ∈g, that is, coincides with the tangent space of the
orbit Ad∗(G)ξ at the point ξ. This shows that every leaf of the canonical Poisson
structure is invariant under the action of Ad∗(G), and for any orbit θ of Ad∗(G)
and any ξ ∈θ, Tξθ = Lξ. Since G is connected, all the orbits of Ad∗(G) are all the
leaves.
□
Corollary 5.3.3 Let G beaconnectedLiegroupandlet F beanorbitofthecoadjoint
representation of G. Then there exists a unique symplectic structure ωF on F, such
that the identity immersion i : F −→g∗is a Poisson manifold homomorphism for
the canonical Poisson structure on g∗. Furthermore, ωF is a G-invariant symplectic
structure.
Proof This is a direct application of Proposition 5.2.2 and its corollary.
□
In the following discussions, we call the symplectic structure ωF in the above
corollary the canonical symplectic structure on the orbit F.
Proposition 5.3.4 Let G be a connected Lie group, let F be an orbit of the coadjoint
representation of G, and let ωF be the canonical symplectic structure on F. Then
the symplectic G-space (F, ωF) is a Poisson G-space, and the identity immersion
μ : F −→g∗is a moment map of (F, ωF).
Proof In fact, according to Proposition 5.2.2, for any a ∈g, we have H⟨μ,a⟩=
Ha|F = a|F. Thus for any ξ ∈F, H⟨μ,a⟩(ξ) = a(ξ). This shows that (F, ωF)
is a Hamiltonian G-space and μ is a moment map. Also, it is obvious that μ is
G-equivariant, thus by Proposition 4.3.5, (F, ωF) is a Poisson G-space.
□
Proposition 5.3.5 Let (M, ω) be a Poisson G-space, and let μ : M −→g∗be a mo-
ment map of (M, ω) such that for any s ∈G and x ∈M, μ(sx) = Ad∗(s)μ(x), Then
for the canonical Poisson structure on g∗, μ is a Poisson manifold homomorphism.
Proof In fact, μ is G-equivariant by assumption, so by Proposition 4.3.2, the 2-
dimensional closed cochain cμ = 0. Thus for any a, b ∈g,
{μ∗(a), μ∗(b)} = {⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩} = ⟨μ, [a, b]⟩= μ∗[a, b] = μ∗{a, b}.
Since a basis of g can be viewed as a coordinate system on g∗, thus by the above
equality,
μ∗{ f, h} = {μ∗( f ), μ∗(h)},
f, h ∈C∞(g∗).
Thus the proposition follows.

5.3 Poisson Structures on the Dual of a Lie Algebra

Next, we will prove that if (M, ω) is just a Hamiltonian G-space but not necessary
a Poisson space, then by replacing the canonical Poisson structure on g∗by a Poisson
structure determined by the G-space (M, ω), the conclusions above still hold (see
Refs.[17, 23]).
As before, let (a1, . . . , an) be a basis of g. We call the map
ϕ : ξ −→
n

i=1
⟨ξ, ai⟩∂
∂ai
,
ξ ∈g∗,
a canonical linear map from g∗into the vector ﬁeld space of g∗. It follows from the
deﬁnition that ϕ is invariant under the parallel translations of g∗.
The map ϕ can be extended to a canonical injective homomorphism from the
exterior algebra (g∗) into the skew symmetric contravariant tensor algebra D∗(g∗)
of g∗, such that the image of p(g∗) under this homomorphism is the degree p skew
symmetric contravariant vector ﬁeld space that is invariant under parallel translations
of g∗. In fact, if p(g∗) is identiﬁed with the skew symmetric p-form space Ap(g)
of g, then a p-form β ∈Ap(g) corresponds to the tensor ﬁeld ˜β ∈Dp(g∗) with the
following coordinate expression:
˜β = 1

∂ai1
∧· · · ∧
∂
∂ai p
,
where the indices i1, . . . , i p run through all integers 1, . . . , n.
For any α ∈Ap(g) and β ∈Aq(g), we have [˜α, ˜β]S = 0. We point out that for the
degree +1 Z2-derivation d of the algebra A(g), we have (d β)(a, b) = −β([a, b]),
where β ∈A1(g) and a, b ∈g are all arbitrary. In fact, this identity is a direct con-
sequence of the following well-known formula:
(d β)(a, b) = aβ(b) −bβ(a) −β([a, b]),
where d is the coboundary operator of the cochain complex on g with values in R
(see Ref.[13]).
Proposition 5.3.6 For any p ≥0 and and β ∈Ap(g), we have [w, ˜β]S = −(	
d β),
where w is deﬁned by formula (5.3.1).
Proof Since the map ρ : u −→[w, u]S, u ∈D∗(g∗), is a Z2-derivation of the al-
gebra D∗(g∗), and ϕ : β −→˜β, β ∈A(g), is a homomorphism from the algebra
A(g) into D∗(g∗), it sufﬁces to verify the equality for β = ξ ∈g∗. If ξ ∈g∗, then
˜ξ = 
n
i=1 ⟨ξ, ai⟩

Therefore the proposition follows.
□
Remark 5.3.7 We have
2
d2 β = 2[w, [w, ˜β]S]S = [[w, w]S, ˜β]S = 0.
Thus the equality d2 = 0 is just another form of [w, w]S = 0.
Corollary 5.3.8 Let β ∈A2(g) be a 2-cochain on g. Then in order for w −˜β to be
a Poisson structure on g∗, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that β is a closed 2-cochain,
that is, d β = 0.
Proof In fact, we have
[w −˜β, w −˜β]S = [w, w]S −[w, ˜β]S −[ ˜β, w]S = −2[w, ˜β]S = 2(	
d β),
Thus [w −˜β, w −˜β]S = 0 if and only if d β = 0.
□
According to the above corollary, every closed 2-cochain β on g corresponds to a
Poisson structure w −˜β on g∗. We denote the bracket of C∞(g∗) deﬁned by w −˜β
by { , }β. This bracket can be characterized by the following equality:
{a, b}β = [a, b] −[[ ˜β, a]S, b]S = [a, b] + β(a, b),
∀a, b ∈g.
Let G be a Lie group, let g be the Lie algebra of G, and let β be a closed 2-cochain
on g. Then in general, the Poisson structure w −˜β is not necessary invariant under
the coadjoint representation of G. We will see that if G is simply connected, then
w −˜β is invariant under an afﬁne action of G on g∗, such that the linear part of this
afﬁne action is the coadjoint representation of G.
Lemma 5.3.9 Let β ∈A2(g) be a closed 2-cochain on g with values in R. Deﬁne a
linear map β : g −→g∗such that

β(a), b

= β(a, b),
∀a, b ∈g,
and use the dual relation to deﬁne a representation ad∗of g on g∗by
−

ad∗(a)ξ, b

= ⟨ξ, ad(a)b⟩,
∀ξ ∈g∗, ∀a, b ∈g.
Then for any a, b ∈g,

5.3 Poisson Structures on the Dual of a Lie Algebra
103
ad∗(a)β(b) −ad∗(b)β(a) −β([a, b]) = 0.
Proof In fact, by the deﬁnitions, for any c ∈g,

ad∗(a)β(b) −ad∗(b)β(a) −β([a, b]), c

= −β(b, [a, c]) + β(a, [b, c]) −β([a, b], c) = (d β)(a, b, c) = 0.
Thus the equality holds.
□
This lemma shows that if β is a closed 2-cochain, then β is a closed 1-cochain on
g with values in g∗, which has the g-module structure deﬁned via ad∗. Note that for
any a ∈g,

β(a), a

= 0. In general, there exist closed 1-cochains on g with values
in g∗that do not satisfy this condition, for example, when g is a commutative Lie
algebra, then there are such closed 1-cochains on g.
Lemma 5.3.10 Let g be the Lie algebra of a simply connected Lie group G, and
let χ be a closed 1-cochain on g with values in the g-module g∗(with respect to
the representation ad∗). Then there exists a unique differentiable map f : G −→g∗
such that for any s, t ∈G and a ∈g,
(1)
f (st) = f (s) + Ad∗(s) f (t),
(2) d f (a) = χ(a).
Proof For any a ∈g, let La be the left invariant vector ﬁeld on G that corresponds
to a:
La : s −→sa,
∀s ∈G.
Let α be a differential 1-form on G with values in g∗such that for any s ∈G and
any a ∈g, α(sa) = Ad∗(s)χ(a). Then we have
α(s exp(ta)b) = Ad∗(s) Ad∗(exp(ta))χ(b)
= Ad∗(s)χ(b) −t Ad∗(s) ad∗(a)χ(b) + t2(· · · ).
Thus at the point s ∈G, Laα(Lb) −Lbα(La) is equal to
−Ad∗(s)(ad∗(a)χ(b) −ad∗(b)χ(a)).
Since χ is a closed 1-cochain, we have
Laα(Lb) −Lbα(La) = −α(L[a,b]) = α([La, Lb]).
Thus
(d α)(La, Lb) = Laα(Lb) −Lbα(La) −α([La, Lb]) = 0.
This equality holds for arbitrary a, b ∈g, thus d α = 0. Also, since G is simply
connected, there exists a unique differentiable map f from G into g∗such that

104

Poisson Manifolds
d f = α and f (e) = 0 (e is the identity of G). Now for arbitrary s ∈G and a ∈g,
d f (sa) −Ad∗(s) d f (a) = α(sa) −Ad∗(s)α(a) = 0.
This shows that f (st) −f (s) −Ad∗(s) f (t) is independent of t. But it is 0 when
t = e, thus f satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2). Conversely, if f satisﬁes (1) and (2),
then
d f (sa) = Ad∗(s) d f (a) = Ad∗(s)χ(a),
and f (e) = 0, thus the uniqueness follows.
□
Lemma 5.3.11 Let g be the Lie algebra of a Lie group G, and let f : G −→g∗be
a differentiable map such that for any s, t ∈G, f (st) = f (s) + Ad∗(s) f (t). Then:
(1) For any a ∈g and t ∈G,
ad∗(a) f (t) = d f (a) −Ad∗(t) d f (Ad(t−1)a).
(2) For the afﬁne action of G on g∗deﬁned by the equation sξ = Ad∗(s)ξ + f (s),
we have
ab = [a, b] + ⟨d f (a), b⟩,
∀a, b ∈g.
Proof Take derivatives of the equality f (st) = f (s) + Ad∗(s) f (t) with respect to
s and t respectively to get:
d f (at) = d f (a) −ad∗(a) f (t),
d f (sa) = Ad∗(s) d f (a),
∀s, t ∈G,
∀a ∈g.
Replace s by t and replace a by Ad(t−1)a in the second equality to get
d f (at) = Ad∗(t) d f (Ad(t−1)a).
Then apply the ﬁrst equality to obtain (1).
View the elements of g as functions on g∗, then from sξ = Ad∗(s)ξ + f (s), it
follows that
b(sξ) = ⟨sξ, b⟩=

Ad∗(s)ξ + f (s), b

,
∀s ∈G, ξ ∈g∗.
Take derivative with respect to s to get
(ab)(ξ) = d b(aξ) =

−ad∗(a)ξ + d f (a), b

= ⟨ξ, [a, b]⟩+ ⟨d f (a), b⟩= ([a, b])(ξ) + ⟨d f (a), b⟩,
which holds for arbitrary ξ ∈g∗and a, b ∈g. Thus (2) is proved.

5.3 Poisson Structures on the Dual of a Lie Algebra
105
Now assume that g is the Lie algebra of a simply connected Lie group G. Let β
be a closed 2-cochain on g with values in R, and let β be the 1-cochain on g with
values in g∗such that for any a, b ∈g,

β(a), b

= β(a, b). According to Lemma
5.3.10, there exists a unique differentiable map fβ from G into g∗such that for any
s, t ∈G and a ∈g, we have
fβ(st) = Ad∗(s) fβ(t) + fβ(s) and
d fβ(a) = β(a).
Thus we can use the equality
sξ = Ad∗(s)ξ + fβ(s),
∀s ∈G, ξ ∈g∗,
to deﬁne an afﬁne action of G in g∗. We call an afﬁne action of G in g∗thus deﬁned
the action associated with the closed 2-cochain β. On the other hand, according to
the corollary of Proposition 5.3.6, we know that from a closed 2-cochain β, a tensor
˜β ∈D2(g∗) can be determined such that w −˜β is a Poisson structure on g∗.
Proposition 5.3.12 Let g be the Lie algebra of a Lie group G, and let β be a closed
2-cochain on g with values in R. If G is simply connected, then under the afﬁne
action of G in g∗associated with β, the Poisson structure w −˜β on g∗is invariant.
Proof For any s ∈G, let
sg∗: ξ −→Ad∗(s)ξ + fβ(s),
∀ξ ∈g∗,
be the afﬁne automorphism of g∗that corresponds to s. Let { , }β be the bracket
of C∞(g∗) deﬁned by the Poisson structure w −˜β. Then for any s ∈G, a ∈g, and
ξ ∈g∗,
s∗
g∗(a)(ξ) = Ad(s−1)a(ξ) +

fβ(s), a

.
Note that in the equality above, we have viewed s∗
g∗(a) as a function on g∗, and have
used the deﬁnition (see Sect.4.3):
Ad∗(s) = t Ad(s−1),
s ∈G.
Thus, according to part (2) of Lemma 5.3.10,
{s∗
g∗(a), s∗
g∗(b)}β = {Ad(s−1)a, Ad(s−1)(b)}β
= Ad(s−1)[a, b] + β(Ad(s−1)a, Ad(s−1)b)
= Ad(s−1)[a, b] +

β(Ad(s−1)a), Ad(s−1)b

= Ad(s−1)[a, b] +

Ad∗(s) d fβ(Ad(s−1)a), b

.
Also, by part (1) of Lemma 5.3.11,

106
5
Poisson Manifolds
Ad∗(s) d fβ(Ad(s−1)a) = d fβ(a) −ad∗(a) fβ(s).
Thus for any s ∈G and a, b ∈g,
{s∗

g∗(b)}β = Ad(s−1)[a, b] +

g∗([a, b]) +

d fβ(a), b

= s∗
g∗([a, b] + β(a, b)) = s∗
g∗{a, b}β.
This shows that for any s ∈G, sg∗is an automorphism of the Poisson manifold
(g∗, w −˜β). Thus the Poisson structure w −˜β is invariant under the afﬁne action of
G on g∗associated with β.
□
Proposition 5.3.13 The assumptions are the same as in Proposition 5.3.12. All the
leaves of g∗deﬁned by the Poisson structure w −˜β are all the orbits of the action of
G associated with β.
Proof In fact, according to Lemma 5.3.10, we have
ab = [a, b] + ⟨d f (a), b⟩
= [a, b] + β(a, b) = {a, b}β = Hab,
∀a, b ∈g.
This implies a = Ha, ∀a ∈g. The rest of the proof is identical to the proof of
Proposition 5.3.2.
□
Corollary 5.3.14 For any orbit F of g∗under the afﬁne action of G associated with
β, there exists a unique symplectic structure ωF such that the identity immersion μ :
F −→g∗is a Poisson homomorphism with respect to the Poisson structure w −˜β
on g∗. This symplectic structure ωF is invariant under the action of G. Furthermore,
the symplectic G-space (F, ωF) is Hamiltonian, and μ is a moment map.
Proof The proof is similar to the case β = 0 (Corollary of Proposition 5.3.2 and
Proposition 5.3.4).
□
Let (M, ω) be a Hamiltonian G-space, and let μ : M −→g∗be a moment map.
Recall that in Sect.4.2, we deﬁned a closed 2-cochain cμ on g with values in R by
using μ:
cμ(a, b) = {⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩} −⟨μ, [a, b]⟩,
∀a, b ∈g.
Proposition 5.3.15 Choose the Poisson structure w −˜cμ on g∗, then the moment
map μ : M −→g∗is a Poisson manifold homomorphism (see Refs.[15, 17]).
Proof In fact, for any a, b ∈g, we have
{μ∗(a), μ∗(b)} = {⟨μ, a⟩, ⟨μ, b⟩} = ⟨μ, [a, b]⟩+ cμ(a, b)
= μ∗([a, b] + cμ(a, b)) = μ∗{a, b}cμ.
Thus the claim follows.

We have already known (Sect.4.3) that if G acts on g∗by
sξ = Ad∗(s)ξ + ϕμ(s),
s ∈G, ξ ∈g∗,
where
ϕμ(s) = μ(sx) −Ad∗(s)μ(x),
x ∈M,
then the moment map μ : M −→g∗is G-equivariant. In addition, by Proposition
4.3.2 we have cμ(a, b) =

d ϕμ(a), b

, ∀a, b ∈g. Thus d ϕμ = cμ. This shows that
if G is connected, then the afﬁne action of G on g∗can be obtained from the afﬁne
action of the simply connected covering group of G associated with the close cochain
cμ by taking the quotient.
Exercise 5.3.16 Complete the proofs of Proposition 5.3.13 and its corollary.
Exercise 5.3.17 Let g be the Lie algebra of a simply connected Lie group G and let
β be a closed 2-cochain on g with values in R.
(1) Let fβ(G) be the orbit given by the origin of g∗under the afﬁne action of G on
g∗associated with β. Prove that the dimension of fβ(G) is equal to the rank of
β.
(2) Assume that the rank of β is equal to dim g. Choose a left invariant symplectic
structure ω on G such that for any a, b ∈g, ω(a, b) = β(a, b). Prove that (G, ω)
is a Hamiltonian G-space and the map fβ : G −→g∗is a moment map of (G, ω).
(3) Again assume that the rank of β is equal to dim g. Deﬁne a product in g:
(a, b) −→ab,
a, b ∈g,
such that
β(ab, c) = −β(b, [a, c]),
∀a, b, c ∈g.
Prove that for any a, b, c ∈g,
ab −ba = [a, b],
a(bc) −b(ac) = (ab)c −(ba)c.
That is, for this product, g is a “left symplectic” algebra according to Vinberg’s
deﬁnition (see Ref.[25]).

Chapter 6
A Graded Case
6.1
(0, n)-Dimensional Supermanifolds
In this section, we generalize the concept of symplectic structures to supermanifolds
(see Refs.[18, 19]). We ﬁrst give the deﬁnition of supermanifolds, or according to
B. Kostant (see Ref.[18]), graded manifolds.
Deﬁnition 6.1.1 Let M0 be an n0-dimensional manifold, and let A be a variety of
R-algebras on M0 with the following properties:
1. for any open set U ⊂M0, A(U) is a Z2-graded algebra:
A(U) = A(U)0 + A(U)1,
where 0 and 1 represent the two elements in Z2;
2. the variety A is locally isomorphic to the tensor product over R of the variety
of differentiable functions on M0 and the exterior algebra (Rn1) (for some
n1 ∈Z+) considered as a Z2-graded algebra.
Then we call M = (M0, A) an (n0, n1)-dimensional supermanifold, and call M0 the
base space.
According to this deﬁnition, whenU is sufﬁciently small, we have an isomorphism
from A(U) onto C∞(U) ⊗(Rn1), which maps A(U)p (p ∈Z2) onto
C∞(U) ⊗

q≡p (mod 2)
q(Rn1).
In the following discussions, we will only consider the special case where the base
manifold M0 shrinks to a point e. In this case, the dimension of M = (e, A) has the
form (0, n). Such a supermanifold is formed by a point e and a Z2-graded algebra A
that is isomorphic to (Rn). For this type of supermanifolds, the involved questions
are purely algebraic, and thus we can replace R by any ﬁeld k of characteristic 0 in
the discussions.

A Graded Case
We call a Z2-graded k-algebra that is isomorphic to (kn) a rank n Grassmann
algebra over k. Thus a Grassmann algebra is a Z2-commutative algebra of dimen-
sion 2n, it is generated by a collection of grading 1 elements x1, . . . , xn such that
x1x2 · · · xn ̸= 0.
Let M = (e, A) be a (0, n)-dimensional supermanifold. We call a collection of
elements x1, . . . , xn in A1 a coordinate system on M if x1x2 · · · xn ̸= 0. If x1, . . . , xn
form a coordinate system on M, then x1, . . . , xn generate the algebra A. Thus choos-
ing a coordinate system amounts to giving an isomorphism from A onto (kn). Let
m be the maximal ideal of A, that is, the ideal generated by a coordinate system of
M (or A1). We call the vector space m/m2 the covector space on M, and denote it
by T ∗
e M. The space T ∗
e M is an n-dimensional space, all its elements have grading
1. The dual space TeM = (m/m2)∗of T ∗
e M is called the vector space on M.
Let DerA be the left A-module formed by the Z2-derivations of A, then the
elements of DerA are called the vector ﬁelds on M. For any X ∈DerA and a ∈A,
denote by Xa the image of a under X. As a vector space over k, DerA is also Z2-
graded. If p ∈Z2, then (DerA)p is the set of the k-endomorphisms X of A that
satisfy
1. X Aq ⊂Ap+q, q = 0, 1, and
2. X(ab) = (Xa)b + (−1)p·qa(Xb), ∀a ∈Aq, b ∈A.
As a left A-module, DerA is a graded A-module, that is, for any p, q ∈Z2,
Ap(DerA)q ⊂(DerA)p+q.
We deﬁne a bracket [ , ] on DerA as follows:
[X, Y] = X ◦Y −(−1)p·qY ◦X,
∀X ∈(DerA)p, Y ∈(DerA)q.
Then DerA becomes a Lie superalgebra over k (see Deﬁnition2.2.2).
Let x1, . . . , xn be a coordinate system on M = (e, A). Then for any 1 ≤i ≤n,
there exists a unique Pi ∈(DerA)1 such that Pix j = δi j. We denote this Pi by
∂
∂xi .
Then the Z2-derivations:
∂
∂x1
, . . . , ∂
∂xn
from a basis of the A-module DerA, and for i, j = 1, . . . , n,

Let A be a Grassman algebra over k (according to our deﬁnition), and let E be
a Z2-graded left A-module. Since A is a Z2-commutative algebra, we can deﬁne a
right A-module structure on E such that
xa = (−1)p·qax,
∀x ∈E p, a ∈Aq.

6.1 (0, n)-Dimensional Supermanifolds
111
Then for any a, b ∈A and x ∈E, a(xb) = (ax)b. Therefore, all Z2-graded left A-
modules can be deﬁned to be two sided (A, A)-modules.
Let E beaZ2-gradedleft A-module.Weuse Hom A(E, A)todenotetheZ2-graded
vector space over k of linear maps from E to A. The elements of Hom A(E, A) of
grading p are the k-linear maps ϕ from E into A such that:
1. ϕ(Eq) ⊂Ap+q, and
2. ϕ(ax) = (−1)p·qaϕ(x),
∀q ∈Z2, a ∈Aq, x ∈E.
We can deﬁne a Z2-graded left A-module structure on Hom A(E, A) such that
(aϕ)(x) = a(ϕ(x)),
∀a ∈A, x ∈E, ϕ ∈Hom A(E, A).
We call the Z2-graded A-module 1(M) = Hom A(DerA, A) the differential 1-
form module of the supermanifold M = (e, A). It can be proved that there exists a
unique k-linear map d : A −→1(M) such that
(d a)(X) = (−1)p·q Xa,
∀a ∈Ap, X ∈(DerA)q.
Then d Ap ⊂1(M)p. For a ∈Ap and b ∈Aq, set
(d a)b = (−1)p·qb(d a),
then
d(ab) = (d a)b + a(d b), a, b ∈A.
Itcanbeshownthatif x1, . . . , xn formacoordinatesystemon M,then(d x1, . . . , d xn)
is a basis of the A-module 1(M).
Now we deﬁne supermanifolds T M and T ∗M. If A is a Grassmann algebra, then
any Z2-graded left A-module E is a two-sided module, thus for any p ≥1, we can
deﬁne the tensor power
⊗pE = E ⊗E ⊗· · · ⊗E



pcopies
.
Denote by ⊗E the direct sum of all ⊗pE and equip it with the usual product, then
⊗E is also called a tensor algebra. This is a doubly graded algebra, its gradation is
in Z × Z2. The elements of grading (p, p) are the elements of the vector subspace
of ⊗pE spanned by the elements u1 ⊗u2 ⊗· · · ⊗u p, where ui ∈E p(i) such that

1≤i≤p
p(i) = p.
Let I be the two-sided ideal of the tensor algebra ⊗E generated by the following
elements:
u ⊗v −(−1)p·qv ⊗u,
u ∈E p, v ∈Eq,

112

A Graded Case
and let S(E) = ⊗E/I. We call S(E) the Z2-graded symmetric algebra of the A-
module E. Since E is doubly graded, S(E) is also a doubly graded algebra, it has both
a gradation in Z and a gradation in Z2. For the Z2-gradation, it is Z2-commutative.
If A is a rank n Grassmann algebra, and E is a free Z2-graded A-module with a
basis consists of r elements of grading 1 (Z2-gradation), then the symmetric alge-
bra S(E) is a rank n + r Grassmann algebra with respect to the Z2-gradation. In
particular, S(DerA) and S(Hom A(DerA, A)) are both rank 2n Grassmann algebras.
Let M = (e, A)bea(0, n)-dimensionalsupermanifold.Wecallthesupermanifold
(e, S(1(M)) the tangent supermanifold of M and denote it by T M, and call the
supermanifold (e, S(DerA)) the cotangent supermanifold of M and denote it by
T ∗M. Both supermanifolds T M and T ∗M are (0, 2n)-dimensional. The canonical
inclusion homomorphism
A −→S0(DerA) ⊂S(DerA)
can be viewed as a homomorphism between the supermanifold M and the super-
manifold T ∗M, while the canonical inclusion map
A −→S0(1(M)) ⊂S(1(M))
can be viewed as a homomorphism between the supermanifold M and the super-
manifold T M.
We now deﬁne the linear complex of differential forms (M) on the supermani-
fold M = (e, A). Let
0(M) = A,
1(M) = Hom A(DerA, A).
For p > 1, deﬁne p(M) as follows:
1. p(M) is submodule of Hom A(⊗pDerA, A), and
2. for 1 ≤i ≤p, if ϕ ∈p(M), then
ϕ(X1 ⊗· · · ⊗Xi ⊗Xi+1 ⊗· · · ⊗X p)
= −(−1)pi·pi+1ϕ(X1 ⊗· · · ⊗Xi+1 ⊗Xi ⊗· · · ⊗X p)
holds for arbitrary X1, . . . , X p ∈DerA (the Z2-grading of Xi is pi, 1 ≤i ≤p).
We view ϕ ∈p(M) as a map from (DerA)p into A and let
ϕ(X1 ⊗· · · ⊗X p) = ϕ(X1, . . . , X p).
The A-module p(M) is a Z2-graded submodule of Hom A(⊗pDerA, A). We denote
the subspace of p(M) formed by the elements whose Z2-grading are p by p
p(M).
Then the elements in p
p(M) are (p, p)-grading differential forms.
We can deﬁne an associative product in (M) = 	
p p(M) by

6.1 (0, n)-Dimensional Supermanifolds
113
(ϕ, ψ) −→ϕ ∧ψ,
ϕ, ψ ∈(M).
This deﬁnition is similar to the deﬁnition of the exterior product of two skew-
symmetric forms (see Refs.[18, 21]). Under this product, (M) is a Z × Z2-graded
algebra, that is
p
p ∧q
q(M) ⊂p+q
p+q(M).
If
a ∈Ap = 0
p(M),
ψ ∈q
q(M),
then we have
a ∧ψ = (−1)p·qψ ∧a = aψ.
If
ϕ ∈p
p(M),
ψ ∈q
q(M),
then we have
ϕ ∧ψ = (−1)p·q+p·qψ ∧ϕ.
Let x1, . . . , xn be coordinates on M. As an algebra over k, (M) is generated by
the following 2n elements:
x1, . . . , xn (∈0
1) and
d x1, . . . , d xn (∈1
1).
They satisfy the following relations:
xix j + x jxi = 0,
xi d x j + d x jxi = 0,
d xi ∧d x j −d x j ∧d xi = 0.
These relations show that as a left A-module, (M) is isomorphic to A ⊗k k[T1, . . . ,
Tn], where k[T1, . . . , Tn] is the polynomial algebra with indeterminates T1, . . . , Tn
over k.
It is not hard to see that if n ̸= 0, then for any p ≥0, p(M) ̸= {0}. If a k-
endomorphism γ of (M) satisﬁes
γ (q
q(M)) ⊂p+q
p+q(M),
∀(q, q) ∈Z × Z2,
then we call it a degree (p, p) endomorphism of (M). If a degree (p, p) endomor-
phism γ satisﬁes
γ (ϕ ∧ψ) = γ (ϕ) ∧ψ + (−1)p·q+p·qϕ ∧γ (ψ),
∀ϕ ∈q(M), ψ ∈(M),

114

A Graded Case
then we call it a Z × Z2-derivation of (M). It can be proved that there exists a
unique Z × Z2-derivation d of degree (1, 0) on (M) such that
1. d2 = 0, and
2. (d a)(X) = (−1)p·q Xa,
∀a ∈Ap, X ∈(DerA)q.
This derivation is the extension of the map d : A −→1(M) deﬁned before. The
chain complex deﬁned by d has zero homology, that is, the sequence
0 −→k −→A = 0(M)
d
−→1(M)
d
−→· · ·
is an exact sequence.
6.2
(0, n)-Dimensional Symplectic Supermanifolds
Let M = (e, A) be a (0, n)-dimensional supermanifold, and let ω ∈2
0(M) be a
differential form satisfying the following conditions:
(1) if X ∈DerA such that ω(X, Y) = 0, ∀Y ∈DerA, then X = 0; and
(2) d ω = 0.
Then we call ω a symplectic form on M.
Let X ∈(DerA)p, denote by i(X) the degree (−1, p) endomorphism of (M)
deﬁned by the following formula:
(i(X)ϕ)(Y1, . . . , Yq−1) = (−1)p·qϕ(X, Y1, . . . , Yq−1),
where ϕ ∈q(M) and Y1, . . . , Yq−1 ∈DerA. It can be proved that i(X) is a Z × Z2-
derivation of degree (−1, p). Condition (1) above implies that for a symplectic
structure ω, the map X −→i(X)ω, X ∈DerA, is an injection. Thus, if condition
(1) is satisﬁed, then the map X −→i(X) is an isomorphism from the A-module
DerA onto the A-module 1(M).
If ω be a symplectic structure on M, then it induces a skew symmetric bilinear
form ωe on TeM, and by condition (1), ωe is nondegenerate.
Proposition 6.2.1 Let ω be a symplectic structure on M = (e, A). There exist a
coordinate system x1, . . . , xn on M and an n × n symmetric matrix (λi j) over the
ﬁeld k, such that ω = 
n
i, j=1 λi j d xi ∧d x j and det(λi j) ̸= 0.
This conclusion is similar to Darboux Theorem (Sect.2.3), it is a basic and special
case of Theorem 5.3 in [18].
A vector ﬁeld X ∈DerA is called a symplectic vector ﬁeld if it satisﬁes d i(X)ω =
0. The symplectic vector ﬁelds on M form a Lie sub-superalgebra S of the Lie
superalgebra DerA. It can be proved (see Ref.[14]) that if n ≥4, then S is a simple
Lie superalgebra, that is, S and {0} are the only ideals of S.

6.2 (0, n)-Dimensional Symplectic Supermanifolds
115
For any a ∈A, there exists a unique Ha ∈DerA such that i(Ha)ω = d a. This Ha
is a symplectic vector ﬁeld. The sequence
{0} −→k −→A
H
−→S −→{0}
is an exact sequence.
Deﬁne a Poisson bracket on A by {a, b} = Hab, a, b ∈A. Then A becomes a Lie
superalgebra with center k, and the map H : a −→Ha, a ∈A, is a Lie superalgebra
homomorphism. For any a ∈Ap, b ∈Aq and c ∈A,
{a, bc} = {a, b}c + (−1)p·qb{a, c}.
Let x1, . . . , xn be coordinates on M such that ω = 
n
i, j=1 d xi ∧d x j. Then for
any j,
i
 ∂
∂x j

ω = 2 d x j
and
Hx j = 1
2
∂
∂x j
.
Thus for 1 ≤i, j ≤n, {xi, x j} = 1
2δi j.
6.3
The Canonical Symplectic Structure on T ∗P
Let P = (e, A) be a (0, n)-dimensional supermanifold. Any X ∈DerA = S1(DerA)
can be identiﬁed with an element of the Grassmann algebra S(DerA). On the other
hand, for any X ∈(DerA)p, there exists a unique Z2-derivation X of Z2-grading p
in S(DerA) such that
(1)
X(a) = Xa,
∀a ∈A = S0(DerA),
(2)
X(Y) = [X, Y],
∀Y ∈DerA = S1(DerA).
The derivation X has degree zero with respect to the Z-gradation. Also, since
T ∗P = (e, S(DerA)),
X is a vector ﬁeld on T ∗P (i.e. an extension of X).
If x1, . . . , xn are coordinates on P, we can view each
∂
∂xi as an element in S(DerA)
and let yi =
∂
∂xi , i = 1, . . . , n. Then x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn are coordinates on T ∗P
and

∂
∂xi
x j = δi, j,

∂
∂xi
y j = 0,
i, j = 1, . . . , n.

A Graded Case
There exists a unique differential form α ∈1
0(T ∗P) such that for any X ∈DerA,
α(X) = X. This form is similar to the Liouville form, and we have α = 
n
i=1 yi d xi
under the coordinates x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn. The differential form
ω = −d α =
n

i=1
−d yi ∧d xi
is a canonical symplectic structure on T ∗P. The form ωe is the neutral form of duality
on the space Te(T ∗P), which is canonically isomorphic to the space Te P + (Te P)∗.
