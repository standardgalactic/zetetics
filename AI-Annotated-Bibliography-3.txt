Emergence of Intelligence in human history 
• When did humans get smart? Maybe a lot earlier than some thought, by Pete Spotts 
(Christian Science Monitor, November 7, 2012) 
https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/1107/When-did-humans-get-smart-Maybe-a-lot-
earlier-than-some-thought  
• When did we become fully human? What fossils and DNA tell us about the evolution of 
modern intelligence, by Nicholas Longrich (The Conversation September 9, 2020)

Causes of world human population explosion: 
• United Nations report on the status of world population: 
https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/world-population-
evolution#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution,led%20to%20thi
s%20exponential%20growth Note that the report cites the commonly mentioned “causes” of 
the world’s human population explosion as increased: fertility, longevity, and migration. 
What it does NOT discuss is the underlying causes of those increases. 
• Why Humans run the World. Yuval Noah Harari (Ted Talks) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzj7Wg4DAbs. This Harari Ted talk mirrors the basic 
theme of my videos and of my science fiction novel, Darwin’s Dilemma – that human 
intelligence alone, is not a particularly useful survival tool, but it becomes hugely 
empowered when accompanied by social collaboration. 
• The Renaissance: The 'Rebirth' of Science & Culture by Owen Jarus, Jessie Szalay 
(LiveScience, January 11, 2022) https://www.livescience.com/55230-renaissance.html. Often 
the printing press is noted as one of the technical achievements of the Renaissance but 
seldom as a cause. How else, however, did the amazing ensuing technical achievements 
suddenly emerge if not through the sharing of human experience? 
• 6 Causes of the Renaissance. Quizlet. https://quizlet.com/91117969/6-causes-of-the-
renaissance-flash-cards/ Frequently the causes are listed without any mention of what, in 
turn, caused them. 
• The world population explosion: causes, backgrounds and projections for the future. J. Van 
Bave, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987379/. The specific timing appears 
connected to the industrial revolution. “The death rate went down but the birth rate still 
didn’t”

Proposed controls on AI technology:

article is well worth a read. 
• Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans, 2. Solutions to address AI’s anticipated

anticipated-negative-impacts/  “A number of participants in this canvassing offered solutions 
to the worrisome potential future spawned by AI. Among them: 1) improving collaboration 
across borders and stakeholder groups; 2) developing policies to assure that development of 
AI will be directed at augmenting humans and the common good; and 3) shifting the 
priorities of economic, political and education systems to empower individuals to stay ahead 
in the ‘race with the robots.’”
