Abstract
Datasets scraped from the internet have been critical to the successes of large-scale machine
learning. Yet, this very success puts the utility of future internet-derived datasets at potential
risk, as model outputs begin to replace human annotations as a source of supervision.
In this work, we ﬁrst formalize a system where interactions with one model are recorded as
history and scraped as training data in the future. We then analyze its stability over time by
tracking changes to a test-time bias statistic (e.g. gender bias of model predictions). We ﬁnd
that the degree of bias ampliﬁcation is closely linked to whether the model’s outputs behave
like samples from the training distribution, a behavior which we characterize and deﬁne
as consistent calibration. Experiments in three conditional prediction scenarios – image
classiﬁcation, visual role-labeling, and language generation – demonstrate that models that
exhibit a sampling-like behavior are more calibrated and thus more stable. Based on this
insight, we propose an intervention to help calibrate and stabilize unstable feedback systems.

Introduction
Due to the successes of large-scale training in machine learning [27, 5, 48, 53], datasets derived from publicly
available internet data have become indispensable to the machine learning community. For example, without
relying on internet-scale collection, it would be cost-prohibitive to manually construct key datasets such as
ImageNet [9], The Pile [16], or YFCC100M [64]. While the internet has served as a large, easily-accessible
source of human generated data in the past, the growing deployment of machine learning systems puts this
procedure at risk. As models begin to create and annotate a signiﬁcant fraction of internet content, the utility
of the internet as a data source may decrease rapidly.
As an example in visual role-labeling, consider a classiﬁer trained on public photos and their associated tags
[68], as depicted in Figure 1. Instead of manually tagging photos, some users may instead choose to auto-tag
their photos with the model’s predictions. These photos, now stored in internet history, may be scraped as
training data for an updated iteration of the image-tagging model. Any systematic biases introduced by the
model, such as consistently mislabeling female doctors as nurses as in Figure 1, are now encoded into the
training data. This data feedback gradually degrades the quality of the internet as a data source, since sources
of supervision become driven by model outputs rather than human annotation.
These issues have already been encountered. Worried over their machine translation model training on its own
online translations, Google researchers started watermarking model outputs to mitigate feedback risk [65].
Similar concerns have been raised in situations where model predictions may exacerbate existing toxicity,
harm, or other biases [17, 70]. In such cases, a viable strategy for model developers is to weigh the beneﬁt
of updating their model to new internet content versus the cost of amplifying biases via such model-induced
feedback. However, it is not yet understood when and to what degree data feedback is an issue in practice.
In this work, we deﬁne the data feedback setting and carefully study how model biases change under feedback.
In particular, we ask: Are there conditions that stabilize bias ampliﬁcation? We answer this in the afﬁrmative,
ﬁnding that one crucial path to achieving stability guarantees is having a consistently calibrated training
procedure – one that produces models with a bias similar to its training distribution. Furthermore, this form of
calibration can be realistically achieved in natural experimental settings. Speciﬁcally, models that behave like
samplers (i.e. replicate their training distribution well) are more likely to be calibrated and thus more stable. In

Figure 1: A simple example illustrating data feedback in practice. An image-tagging model is
trained on a large image dataset from the internet. Some users choose to auto-tag new images
with the model’s predictions and post them online, while others continue to manually tag their
images. After some time, the model deployer may choose to update their model by re-scraping
the internet and re-training the model on the newly scraped data, which now includes feedback
from previous model predictions.
addition, many prediction algorithms that do not explicitly perform sampling, such as image classiﬁers, fulﬁll
this behavior through a conjectured phenomenon called Distributional Generalization [42].
Formally, we quantify the stability of data feedback with a bias metric φ(x, ˆy), where ˆy = ft(x) are predictions
from the model at time t. For example, the predictions ˆy represent image tags or sentence completions given a
prompt, and the corresponding bias metrics φ represent gender bias in the predicted tags or toxicity of the
generated text. Our theoretical result shows that if the trained models do not increase bias by more than error
δ, then the total amount of bias ampliﬁcation is bounded by m+k
m δ, where m and k refer to the number of new
human-annotated samples and model-annotated samples respectively. Thus both a smaller calibration error δ
and a higher fraction of human-annotated samples m contribute to the global stability of data feedback loops.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 3, we deﬁne the data feedback setting in more detail.
We then describe a speciﬁc notion of calibration (consistent calibration), discuss its connection to sampling,
and show how it gives rise to bounds on bias ampliﬁcation in Section 4. Section 5 demonstrates the utility of
these predictions empirically in three different natural experiment settings:
1. First, we deﬁne a simple data feedback setting in CIFAR [34], where the label distribution is skewed
and data feedback has the potential to amplify label shift. In this case, we show that the feedback
dynamics are stable and consistent with our theoretical predictions.
2. Next, we show that data feedback can signiﬁcantly amplify gender biases in a visual semantic role
labeling task [69]. Our bounds predict that the dynamics may be unstable since the initial calibration
error is large, which is consistent with gender bias ampliﬁcation identiﬁed in earlier work [70].
3. Third, we examine data feedback for language generation on a toxic prompts dataset [17] and
demonstrate that toxicity and repetition amplify, with sampling-based generation schemes enjoying
substantially higher stability than beam search methods.
Finally, to conclude Section 5, we design an intervention to stabilize beam search methods by leveraging the
sampling-like behavior of interpolating classiﬁers [42]. To do this, we train a language model that overﬁts to
its training set and observe that this procedure signiﬁcantly stabilizes the model’s toxicity and repetition.

Performative prediction.
The general problem of model-induced feedback in machine learning has been
previously studied as performative prediction and strategic classiﬁcation [47, 24], where future data distri-
butions can change arbitrarily in response to the deployed model. In this context, existing work has focused
on methods that optimize towards local or global equilibria of the system [4, 31, 41]. The generality of
the problem setting allows for complex human interactions in-the-loop; however, it is for this reason that
2

experimental evaluation has been limited, and most analyses and experiments have focused on simple models
such as linear policies with Gaussian data [31, 41].
In contrast, motivated by the image tagging example in Section 1, we consider a more restricted form of
feedback, in which new data examples are gathered only from either the “true” human-annotated distribution
or predictions of the currently deployed model. This restriction allows us to analyze feedback stability in more
realistic experimental settings and derive bounds on stability.
Recommendation systems.
Our work is also closely aligned with the study of feedback loops in recom-
mendation systems [58, 55]. In this context, existing work has shown that optimizing strictly for ranking
metrics such as accuracy can create echo chambers, where minority populations are crowded out and disengage
from the platform [26, 32]. This issue arises due to the tension between improving ranking metrics and
considerations of bias, fairness, or diversity [59, 6].
In Section 5.1, we show that a similar phenomenon exists in data feedback: retraining classiﬁers with future
data improves classiﬁcation accuracy, but at the cost of increasing its bias. In the recommendation literature,
one possible successful mitigation strategy is the use of recommendations that are calibrated in proportion
to user interests [59]. Similarly, our work also heavily relies on the calibration of the model’s predictions to
ensure the stability of data feedback.
Bias ampliﬁcation.
Machine learning models have a tendency to amplify at test-time biases that exist in
their training data, a problem known as bias ampliﬁcation [12, 38, 22]. For example, image classiﬁers have
skewed gender predictions, beyond what exists in the training data [70, 66]. In our work, we build on this
literature by studying the multi-step ampliﬁcation of bias via feedback.
Additional discussion relating to semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation can be found in Appendix A.

Deﬁning data feedback and model bias
Our work considers feedback effects in the conditional prediction setting. In the standard conditional prediction
or supervised learning framework, the goal is to learn a function f ∈F, f : X →Y from a collection of
samples {(xi, yi)}
iid
∼P0. P0 represents a ﬁxed human-annotated example distribution (e.g. human-tagged
images or human-written prompts and sentence completions). Motivated by the example in Figure 1 where the
dataset changes over time, we instead consider a series of supervised learning problems from time t = 0 . . . ∞.
At each time t, we learn a new model ft using the latest available internet data.
The series of supervised learning problems are deﬁned by the following. At t = 0, before any data feedback,
only clean human-annotated samples are available on the internet. Thus, the initial model f0 is trained on n0
i.i.d. samples from P0, and we call this initial dataset and the resulting model
S0 ∼Pn0
0
and
f0 ∼A(S0).
Here, A : (X × Y)∗→F refers to a potentially stochastic learning algorithm, which we take to be a neural
network trained on the cross entropy loss via a variant of stochastic gradient descent [50].
For any t ≥1, we assume that data on the internet grows in two ways. Humans naturally continue to interact
with the internet and generate data, creating m new samples following the original distribution P0. Another k
samples are generated by humans interacting with the newest model ft−1 (e.g. users auto-tag their new images
with the provided model). The dataset, derived from accumulated online content, thus evolves as
St = St−1 ∪{(xi, yi)}i∈[m] ∪{(xj, ft−1(xj)}j∈[k],
with (xi, yi)
iid
∼P0 and xj
iid
∼P0(x), where P0(x) denotes the marginal over the covariates. The model is then
updated by re-training on the growing dataset, ft ∼A(St). Formally, the data feedback model we instantiate
in our experiments is deﬁned in Algorithm 1.
Our overall goal is to analyze the behavior of ft over time. Concretely, we are concerned with bias ampliﬁcation,
tracked via a particular bias statistic φ : X × Y →R. To measure ampliﬁcation, we will measure the expected
difference between the bias of the initial, human-annotated distribution P0 and the bias of the predictions of
the model ft. Thus, in both our theoretical and empirical analyses, we will measure ampliﬁcation as

over time t. The expectation in this bias term, Eft[·], is an expectation over all random objects up to time t
during data feedback, which includes random draws in each dataset St and random draws of the model ft.
One important aspect of the data feedback setting is that all covariates are sampled from the same distribution
P0(x), which remains ﬁxed over time. This assumption may be natural in situations similar to Figure 1, where
it may be unlikely that predictions of the image-tagging model inﬂuence the types of photos taken. Though we
make this choice to simplify our analysis, this setting still poses challenging tradeoffs; in Section 5.1, we show
that retraining classiﬁers with future data improves classiﬁcation accuracy at the cost of increasing bias.

Stabilizing bias ampliﬁcation
In this section, we develop theoretical tools that will allow us to make predictions about bias ampliﬁcation in
experimental settings. We begin with a toy example illustrating how good samplers lead to calibration in Sec-
tion 4.1, show how calibration leads to feedback stability via bounds on bias ampliﬁcation in Section 4.2, and
ﬁnally discuss prior work showing when calibration naturally arises in experimental situations in Section 4.3.
4.1
Illustrative example
We begin by expanding our example in Figure 1 to illustrate how data feedback may become unstable. Consider
a set of images of female healthcare workers with high inherent uncertainty – they could each be either a
doctor or a nurse, depending on context cues that are not present in the image (Figure 2 left). In this case, data
feedback on a dataset with twice as many nurses as doctors can rapidly destabilize.
More concretely, any Bayes optimal classiﬁer would predict new examples only as nurse, as nurses are the
majority class and the image is indistinguishable otherwise. Such a model would exacerbate the nurse bias in
the dataset, illustrating how data feedback may amplify biases (Figure 2 top). A natural solution solution to
this problem would be to predict nurses and doctors at a rate equal to the original distribution. Speciﬁcally, a
sampling-based model trained to reproduce the training distribution would exhibit this behavior, continuing to
label a random 2
3 of the examples as nurses and maintaining the level of nurse bias in the dataset (Figure 2
bottom).
A training algorithm that produces models whose outputs match the bias of the training distribution is said
to be consistently calibrated, and we will formally deﬁne how calibration relates to stability in the following
section.
4.2
Achieving stability through calibration
Setup and goals.
We ﬁrst deﬁne a few objects that will be used in our stability analysis. We call the number
of training samples at time t as nt := nt−1 + m + k = n0 + t(m + k). A mixture of past training data, new
human-annotated data, and new model-annotated data, the training data distribution at time t is
Pt = nt−1
nt
Pt−1 + m
nt

bP0(ft−1),
where the shorthand bP(f) denotes the model-annotated distribution, deﬁned as the relabeling of P by f.
Samples are drawn from this distribution by ﬁrst sampling a covariate x ∼P(x) and then returning the
annotated pair (x, f(x)).

Figure 2: A toy example illustrating that models that reproduce the training distribution well
will experience limited feedback effects. Suppose a dataset contains only indistinguishable
examples and slightly over-represents nurses (left). A Bayes-optimal classiﬁer would label new
examples all as nurses, since it is the majority class; this would exacerbate the nurse bias in the
dataset, illustrating the potential harm of data feedback (top). In contrast, a model that behaves
like a sampler would maintain the dataset nurse ratio during prediction, thus stabilizing any
feedback effects (bottom). Images are taken from the imSitu dataset [69].
For ease of analysis in this section, we study the case where the dataset St is drawn fresh from its corresponding
distribution Pt at every timestep. Thus the datasets are drawn as St ∼Pnt
t , redeﬁned in this section only 1.

bias metric φ over distribution P.
Calibration.
In the previous nurses versus doctors example, we discovered that a model that faithfully
represented the training data distribution was more stable under data feedback. Now, we formalize what it
means to faithfully represent the data distribution: We say a learning algorithm is consistently calibrated if the
bias of samples annotated by the model is similar to the bias of samples in the training distribution.
Deﬁnition 1 (Consistent Calibration). A learning algorithm A: (X ×Y)n →F is (δ, φ, P(x), n)-consistently
calibrated if, for any joint distribution Q(x, y) with marginal P(x),
ES∼Qn,f∼A(S)

Qφ −bQ(f)φ
 ≤δ.
If a learning algorithm is consistently calibrated, it means that in expectation, the bias of the trained model will
be close to the dataset bias. Furthermore, it is important this condition holds for all joint distributions with the
marginal P(x), since during data feedback the covariate marginal does not change, i.e. Pt(x) = P0(x) for all
t. Thus, if we have a learning algorithm A that is consistently calibrated with respect to the initial distribution
P0(x), A will also be consistently calibrated for all Pt(x) during data feedback (formalized in Lemma E.1 in
Appendix E). In fact, this property naturally arises in some settings, as discussed in the next subsection.
Intuitively, satisfying this deﬁnition helps to control the amount of bias ampliﬁcation. At time t, a consistently
calibrated algorithm A will have bias no more than δ greater than its training distribution Pt. In turn, the bias
of Pt is reduced when adding human-annotated samples and increased when adding model-annotated samples.
The balance of these two quantities is crucial for stabilizing bias ampliﬁcation, as we now discuss.
Stability.
Our main feedback stability result is a direct consequence of consistent calibration.
1This generative model assumes that St is a new draw from Pt at each timestep, which differs from our earlier
deﬁnition in Algorithm 1 where St is constructed by concatenating new samples with the prior timestep’s dataset. We
make this simplifying assumption only for the theoretical analysis in this section since we are not interested in the
dependence introduced by the draw of each dataset but rather in the dependence between deployed models and training
data distributions. We expect this difference in deﬁnition to be small as the number of samples grows large.

Theorem 1 (Feedback Stability). Let A: (X × Y)n →F be a (δn, φ, P0(x), n)-consistently calibrated
learning algorithm, where calibration error δn is a monotone non-increasing function of dataset size n. Then,
under the data feedback procedure, for all time t,

The proof is provided in Appendix E.
Surprisingly, the bound shows that data-driven feedback can be stable even in the limit of t →∞. From
inspecting the simpliﬁed upper bound, it is clear that both a larger number of human-annotated examples m
and a smaller initial calibration error δn0 serve to stabilize the system and minimize bias ampliﬁcation. This
leads to a natural question: in which situations can we expect a small consistent calibration error?
Intuitively, models that behave like samplers will have low calibration error. In particular, suppose that model
ft has accurately learned the conditional distribution of Pt, i.e. dT V (Pt(y|x), ft(y|x)) ≤δ. Now, we perform
a comparison of two prediction strategies commonly used in machine learning: sampling y ∼ft(y|x) and
argmax prediction y = argmaxy ft(y|x).
If labels are sampled, y ∼ft(y|x), then dT V (Pt, bP(ft)) ≤δ by deﬁnition, and so ft is δ-calibrated for
any metric φ by post-processing. Alternatively, if the top prediction y = argmaxy ft(y|x) is used, ft is not
necessarily guaranteed to be δ-calibrated for bias metric φ, similar to the example in Figure 2.
While it is unsurprising that sampling maintains calibration and argmax predictions can sometimes be
miscalibrated, prior work has made the surprising discovery that under certain conditions, models that do not
explicitly perform sampling can still behave like samplers [42] and thus also provide feedback stability.
4.3
Achieving calibration through Distributional Generalization
As in the example in Figure 2, when there is large uncertainty over the true labels (doctors versus nurses), one
strategy for reducing bias is to sample according to the training distribution. Distributional Generalization
(DG) [42] demonstrates that interpolating classiﬁers, which are argmax predictors, behave similarly; when the
model has high uncertainty over the true labels, it produces outputs that mimic the training distribution.
Concretely, let L : X →[m] be a partioning of the input space into m ∈Z+ parts, where similar points with
high uncertainty are grouped together. This partitioning “coarsens” the input space by mapping hard-to-learn
regions to single points. DG ﬁnds that at this level of coarseness, samples labeled by interpolating classiﬁers
look like samples from the training distribution, i.e. (L(x), f(x)) ≈(L(x), y) [42]. That is, within a speciﬁc
partition, the random process of drawing a sample x and labeling it with a deterministic classiﬁer y = f(x)
produces a distribution similar to drawing x and then sampling a label from the true conditional y ∼p(y|x).
If the bias metric φ was applied over this coarsened space, we may expect feedback stability as a natural
consequence of model outputs behaving like samples. We will now formalize this intuition by linking how a
learning algorithm satisfying DG leads to consistent calibration. We ﬁrst deﬁne the input partioning from [42].
Deﬁnition 2 (Distinguishable Feature [42]). Let L : X →[m] be a coarsening of the input domain X into
m ∈Z+ parts. Deﬁne bP(L) as the relabeling of P by L. Then, L is a (δ, A, P(x), n)-distinguishable feature if
PS∼bP(L)n,f∼A(S),x∼P(x)

f(x) = L(x)

≥1 −δ.
The partitioning L deﬁnes how points in P are grouped together. An appropriate partioning is one where
the learner A can classify the group identity of each point with high accuracy. Additionally, note that the
coarsening L does not depend on the label distribution and relies only on the marginal P(x). This property
is important for data feedback; if L is distinguishable for the initial distribution P0, it will continue to be
distinguishable for all Pt.
Now that we have deﬁned an appropriate partitioning, we can connect it to consistent calibration via DG.
Lemma 4.1. Suppose that bias metric φ is a function of a (δ, A, P(x), n)-distinguishable feature L, i.e.
φ(x, y) = T(L(x), y) for some bounded T : [m] × Y →R. Then, under DG (Conjecture 1 in Appendix E.3),
learning algorithm A is (δ, φ, P(x), n)-consistently calibrated.
6

The proof is provided in Appendix E.4. This lemma is an immediate consequence of DG (Conjecture
1), which states that the coarsened model outputs (L(x), f(x)) are similar to the coarsened training data
(L(x), y) for all bounded tests T; this is the basis for the statement that model outputs behave like samples, i.e.
(L(x), f(x)) ≈(L(x), y). The given bias metric φ is simply one such test.
This result shows that under DG, global stability can be achieved and bias ampliﬁcation is bounded by m+k
m δn0
for all time if the bias metric φ is a function of a δn0-distinguishable feature on the initial dataset.
4.4
Instantiating feedback upper bounds in experiments
We have now seen two strategies for consistent calibration: 1) explicitly, through estimating the conditional
distribution well and sampling outputs, and 2) implicitly through DG, where interpolating classiﬁers provide
guarantees as long as the bias metric is a function of a sufﬁciently coarse statistic of the inputs.
In these settings, one more condition is needed for Theorem 1 to apply – that calibration errors δn are
non-increasing with dataset size n. Although not guaranteed, many learning algorithms and natural data
distributions satisfy this property experimentally, especially if the model regularization is tuned [44], as in done
in practice. We therefore believe it is a reasonable assumption to expect calibration error to be a monotone
decreasing function of dataset size in most experimental situations.
In the next section, we will explore how our derived predictions can help estimate bias ampliﬁcation in realistic
data feedback settings. In order to instantiate the bound in Theorem 1, we need to know the initial consistent
calibration error δn0. As a practical approximation, we estimate δn0 empirically via the calibration error of the
initial model f0. Although this empirical estimate is a lower bound on the consistent calibration error, we ﬁnd
that it is a useful guide, and we observe that the corresponding predictions from Theorem 1 still bound the
empirical ampliﬁcation.
5
Tracking bias ampliﬁcation in feedback experiments
We consider three natural real-world settings that give rise to data feedback: image classiﬁcation, visual
role-labeling, and conditional language generation. The image classiﬁcation and visual role-labeling settings
are inspired by the example in Figure 1, where existing biases in image annotations may amplify. The language
modeling setting is inspired by the rise of online conversational agents [11] and assisted story writing systems
[13], for which there are real concerns about model-generated toxicity or bias [56].
In each of these cases, we will study the behavior of data feedback in three steps: we instantiate Algorithm 1,
measure the empirical bias ampliﬁcation, and then compare the trends to the predictions of Theorem 1. Our
experiments generally identify that feedback stability arises when models behave like samplers and calibration
error is small. Within each setting, we describe the main experimental details followed by the results, with
more thorough experimental setup and model training information in Appendix C.
5.1
Image classiﬁcation
We ﬁrst consider data feedback in a simple image classiﬁcation setting with strong label imbalance. Here,
feedback dynamics are stable and consistent with our theoretical predictions, a consequence of the sampling-
like behavior of interpolating classiﬁers [42].
Setting up the label bias experiment.
Studying data feedback over many rounds requires very large datasets, and we use the CIFAR-5m dataset
[43], which contains 5 million examples synthetically generated by a diffusion model [28] originally trained
on CIFAR-10 [34]. Inspired by the hypothetical presented in Figure 1, we re-balance the dataset to contain
50% dogs, resulting in a 9:1 imbalance ratio compared to any other class. For our bias metric φ, we track the
fraction of the model’s predictions that are dogs. Ideally, we would like this fraction to remain near 50%, the
true data distribution level.
For our model, we train the fast-optimizing BaiduNet9 [39, 7], which is 94% accurate on CIFAR-10. The
model is re-trained from scratch on the (growing) dataset at each new timestep, and training hyperparameters
are re-tuned via grid search throughout data feedback for each new dataset size. We run data feedback
(Algorithm 1) with an initial number of samples n0 = 50k and number of new samples per round m + k = 5k.
We vary the data composition ratio to be either 80% model-labeled or 50% model-labeled samples each round
( m+k
m
= 5 and 2 respectively) and report results for both settings.

Data feedback worst-case simulation
Figure 3: Results of data feedback (Algorithm 1) on CIFAR with dog imbalance. Bias is
measured as the fraction of model predictions that are dogs. We show results when either 80% of
new samples are model-labeled (left), or when 50% of new samples are model-labeled (right).
We tune and train a BaiduNet9 from scratch at each round. The blue line is the empirical dog
prediction fraction, shown with the mean and standard deviation over 3 random seeds. The
orange line shows the ampliﬁcation upper bound predicted by Theorem 1, with δn0 estimated
empirically. The empirical ampliﬁcation in the standard data feedback setting (top) is lower
than in the worst-case data feedback setting (bottom) where calibration errors do not decrease
over time, simulated by subsampling the training set at each round. In both cases, the empirical
curves qualitatively match the behavior of the theoretical bounds, with bias amplifying more
when the fraction of model-labeled samples is greater.
Analyzing label bias ampliﬁcation.
We show the results of running data feedback on the CIFAR-5m dataset in Figure 3 (top). As predicted
by Theorem 1, the fraction of model predictions which are dogs grows faster in the setting with a greater
fraction of model-labeled samples. Speciﬁcally, the bias ampliﬁes +0.8% when m+k
m
= 5 (left) and +0.3%
when m+k
m
= 2 (right). We observe that the theoretical bounds, though conservative, are consistent with the
empirical results. This matches our expectations, since prior work suggests that Distributional Generalization
holds for CIFAR classiﬁers and that the dog class is a distinguishable feature [42], which by Lemma 4.1
implies stability.
While in both settings the dog bias ampliﬁes, the overall classiﬁcation accuracies of the models improve
throughout data feedback, a result of increasing dataset size. Speciﬁcally, as the size of the training set grows
8

from n0 = 50k to n90 = 500k over 90 rounds of data feedback, average classiﬁcation accuracy improves
+2.4% and +1.6% for the models with 50% and 80% model-labeled samples (Figure 7 in Appendix B.1).
Trading off this increase in utility with greater label bias is a challenge for model developers who seek to
update their models to new data. Our theoretical bounds take a step towards characterizing this tradeoff by
upper bounding empirical bias ampliﬁcation.
Finally, observing that the theoretical bounds are loose in Figure 3 (top), we discuss the source of this gap and
where the bounds may more accurately reﬂect the empirical ampliﬁcation. In particular, Theorem 1 assumes
that calibration errors δnt are decreasing with dataset size nt and uses it to globally bound δnt ≤δn0 for all
t, which results in conservative bounds when δnt < δn0. By creating an artiﬁcial setting where we expect
calibration errors to be constant over time, i.e. δnt = δn0 for all t, we can test the validity of the upper bound
in a worst-case situation. We construct this setting by randomly subsampling the training set at each round to
the initial dataset size n0. Speciﬁcally, we modify Line 5 of Algorithm 1 to be
ft := A( ˜St), where ˜St = {zi}i∈n0, zi
iid
∼St.
The empirical trends and theoretical bounds in this worst-case setting are provided in Figure 3 (bottom). We
observe that there is greater empirical ampliﬁcation, and that the upper bounds more accurately reﬂect the
observed ampliﬁcation. This result suggests that the upper bound cannot be further improved without a better
characterization of δnt as a function of nt, which we leave as future work 2.
Ablations.
In Appendix D.1, we provide ablations for many of our experimental choices in Figure 3 (top).
Speciﬁcally, we change the initial dataset size n0; we change the degree of label imbalance for dogs as well as
other classes; we train a standard ResNet18 [27] as well as an underﬁt BaiduNet9; and we provide results on
the non-synthetic CINIC-10 dataset [8]. In each case, we ﬁnd the qualitative takeaways to be the same as in
Figure 3 (top), with bias ampliﬁcation stable overall and in line with Theorem 1.
5.2
Visual role-labeling
Next, we study data feedback on the visual role-labeling task. In line with previous work [69], the initial
calibration error is large; as a result, our bounds predict the dynamics may be unstable, which is mirrored
experimentally by existing gender biases amplifying.
Setting up the gender bias experiment.
We run data feedback on the imSitu dataset [69], which is a task where models are asked to predict both the
overall category of the image (e.g. cooking, jumping, etc.) as well as labels for the subjects and objects (e.g.
female, basketball, etc.). Prior work has found that models trained on this dataset amplify gender disparities at
test-time; for example, 67% of cooking category images in the dataset are labeled female, but a ResNet18
trained on the dataset will label 84% of cooking images as female [70].
Based on this observation, we measure bias as the fraction of the model’s predictions that are female, over the
image categories with an existing female gender bias. Speciﬁcally, we consider all image categories where the
female label ratios of the dataset lie between 60% to 80% 3, and we measure bias as the female prediction
fraction over these images.
We train the default ResNet18-backed [27] conditional random ﬁelds model, proposed in the original imSitu
dataset paper as a baseline [69]. The model is re-trained from scratch on the (growing) dataset at each
new timestep, and training hyperparameters are re-tuned via grid search for each dataset size. We run data
feedback (Algorithm 1) with initial number of samples n0 = 20k and additional number of samples per round
m + k = 5k. We vary the data composition ratio to be either 80% model-labeled or 50% model-labeled
samples at each round ( m+k
m
= 5 and 2 respectively).
Analyzing gender bias ampliﬁcation.
We show results of rolling out data feedback on the imSitu dataset in Figure 4. The initial calibration error δn0
is much larger than in the CIFAR setting; the initial trained model predicts females 90% of the time, though
the dataset female fraction level is at 70%, a phenomenon in line with prior work [70]. As a result, the bound
from Theorem 1 quickly becomes vacuous, crossing over the 100% female prediction fraction mark. This
2For example, scaling laws may be applied to model calibration error as a function of dataset size [1, 51].
3This interval was chosen as it represented a wide range of stereotypically female activities. In Appendix D.2, we
provide plots for all ﬁve intervals: 0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, and 80-100%.

50% of new samples are model-labeled (right). We tune and train a ResNet18 from scratch at
each round. The blue line is the empirical female prediction fraction, shown with the mean and
standard deviation over 3 random seeds. The orange line shows the ampliﬁcation upper bound
predicted by Theorem 1, with δn0 estimated empirically. Since the initial calibration error δn0 is
large, the bounds quickly become vacuous (crossing over the 100% female prediction fraction
mark), which is mirrored by the empirical bias also reaching near 100%.
prediction is mirrored by the empirical bias also reaching near 100% in just 16 rounds of feedback (97% and
95% female prediction fraction when 80% and 50% of new samples are model-labeled, respectively).
Male prediction bias is also ampliﬁed on this task. In Figure 8 in Appendix B.2, we plot the male prediction
bias over the categories with an existing male skew for these same models and ﬁnd that it ampliﬁes quickly,
similar to Figure 4. Interestingly, this implies that gender biases amplify simultaneously and in both directions;
for female-biased categories, predictions become more female, and for male-biased categories, predictions
become more male.
5.3
Conditional language modeling
Lastly, we study data feedback on a conditional language generation task, where models are asked to complete
sentences given suggestive prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that toxicity and repetition can indeed
amplify under feedback, and that sampling-based generation (nucleus sampling) enjoys substantially higher
stability than search-based generation (beam search). Additionally, we propose an intervention for mitigating
bias ampliﬁcation in the beam search setting.
Setting up the toxicity and repetition bias experiment.
We use the Real Toxicity Prompts dataset [17], which is a collection of around 100k sentences collected from
the Open-WebText Corpus [18] with varying levels of toxicity. Each sentence was split into two halves, a
prompt and a continuation. We use this to construct a language modeling task where a model is asked to
complete a sentence given a prompt.
We measure two bias metrics on the model output: toxicity and repetition. Toxicity is measured by counting
the fraction of model outputs classiﬁed as toxic by the Detoxify classiﬁer [23], which was trained on the
Jigsaw toxicity challenge datasets [61, 62, 63] 4. A generation is classiﬁed toxic if the classiﬁer’s toxicity
score is greater than 0.5. We also measure a speciﬁc form of repetition bias: the average number of quotation
4Prior work [10] has adopted a similar method for measuring toxicity. Though toxicity classiﬁers have shortcomings
[37, 54], this work is primarily concerned with aggregate, relative changes in toxicity over time to measure ampliﬁcation.

Ampliﬁcation upper bound (Theorem 1)

Figure 5: Results of data feedback (Algorithm 1) on the Real Toxicity Prompts dataset [17]. Bias
is measured in two ways: the fraction of model outputs that are classiﬁed as toxic by a separate
toxicity classiﬁer [23] (top), and the average number of quotation marks in the generated text
(bottom). We show results for two methods of generating model output: nucleus sampling (left)
and beam search (right). At each round, we ﬁnetune a pretrained GPT2-small. The blue lines
are the empirical measurements, shown with the mean and standard deviation over 3 random
seeds. The orange lines show the ampliﬁcation upper bound predicted by Theorem 1, with δn0
estimated empirically. Nucleus sampling is more stable than beam search for both bias metrics,
particularly for the number of quotes in generated text. Toxicity ampliﬁes downwards for the
beam search models since model generations are less toxic than the dataset.
marks in the generated text. Repetitive text has been studied as a common degeneracy of language models [29,
14], and we count quote frequencies as a simple approximating statistic after observing that repetitive outputs
in this setting commonly contained many quotes (see Appendix B.3 for example outputs).
For the learning algorithm, we ﬁnetune a GPT-2 small [49]. The model is re-initialized to the pretrained GPT-2
weights at each round. Hyperparameters are re-tuned via grid search for each dataset size. To produce sentence
completions on new datapoints for data feedback, we consider two common model generation schemes:
nucleus sampling [29] (top_p = 0.9) and beam search [21] (num_beams = 10). We run data feedback
(Algorithm 1) with an initial number of samples of n0 = 20k and new samples per round m + k = 5k, with
80% of new samples being model-labeled (k = 4k).
Analyzing toxicity and repetition bias ampliﬁcation.
We show the results of rolling out data feedback on the Real Toxicity Prompts dataset in Figure 5. Comparing
the two text generation strategies, bias ampliﬁcation for both toxicity and repetition is greater for the beam
search models, an observation in line with the stability analysis in Section 4. In particular, given a trained
model ft, nucleus sampling approximates sampling from the model y ∼ft(y|x), whereas beam search
approximates ﬁnding the most likely output y = argmaxy ft(y|x). Since Distributional Generalization has
not been shown to hold for language models, Lemma 4.1 cannot guarantee stability, and therefore strategies
that do not explicitly sample, such as beam search, are more likely to be uncalibrated and unstable.

Figure 6: Results of data feedback (Algorithm 1) on the Real Toxicity Prompts dataset [17].
We study three settings for model training and text generation: the existing settings of nucleus
sampling (blue) and beam search (yellow), as well as the proposed intervention of overﬁtting
the model and generating with beam search (red). The model is overﬁt by ﬁnetuning for 5 times
the number of epochs. Other experimental settings are the same as in Figure 5. Overﬁt beam
search behaves much more similarly to nucleus sampling with respect to both toxicity bias (left)
and repetition bias (right), demonstrating the stabilizing effect of the intervention.
After 13 rounds of data feedback, the toxicity of the ﬁnal models (14.5%) did not change from its initial level
for nucleus sampling, while for beam search the toxicity of the ﬁnal models (11.5%) decreased by about 3%
from the initial level. In this case, beam search ampliﬁed the toxicity bias downward since the initial model’s
toxicity (14.5%) was lower than the dataset toxicity level (23%). However, this downward ampliﬁcation is
partially offset by later models better approximating the higher dataset toxicity level (due to lower calibration
error with a larger dataset size), which contributed to the relative stability of toxicity throughout data feedback.
The repetition bias results paint a more dramatic difference between nucleus sampling and beam search. After
13 rounds of data feedback, the average number of quotes in generated text ampliﬁes little for nucleus sampling
(0.4 to 0.6), whereas for beam search it increases signiﬁcantly (2.5 to 5.7). In fact, the beam search empirical
ampliﬁcation even exceeds Theorem 1’s upper bound. We believe this is due to the lack of a calibration
guarantee, exacerbated by the argmax-style generation strategy. Since language models are often not trained to
interpolation, it is unclear if Distributional Generalization holds, and in its absence, language models with
beam search have no stability guarantee. The observed repetition bias may reﬂect this fact.
Ablations.
In Appendix D.3, we run experimental ablations, varying the data feedback variables m and k
and training GPT-2 medium and large models. We observe that the takeaways remain the same: beam search
ampliﬁes repetition bias much more compared to the nucleus sampling or toxicity bias settings.
An intervention to stabilize toxicity and repetition bias.
We now test our understanding of bias ampliﬁcation by designing an intervention to mitigate ampliﬁcation for
beam search models. Leveraging the claim in Distributional Generalization that interpolating models behave
like samplers over a coarsened dataset, we test whether the repetition bias of language models under beam
search can be mitigated by overﬁtting the model with the goal of making it interpolate the training data.
Our intervention is simple: we ﬁnetune the GPT2-small model for 5 times the number of training epochs as
before. Whereas previously the training loss was 3.5 at round 0, it was reduced to 0.4 by the intervention, and
the test set perplexity jumped from 32 to 599 due to overﬁtting. Similar to the non-overﬁt counterpart, sentence
completions from the model are generated via beam search, and all other experimental settings remain the
same as in Figure 5.
12

In Figure 6, we show the results of the intervention. Overﬁtting signiﬁcantly improves the stability of the beam
search model. In particular, the average number of quotes output by the ﬁnal model is reduced from 5.7 to 0.8,
which is closer to the nucleus sampling level at 0.6. In addition, the relative ampliﬁcation was also reduced, as
the ﬁnal overﬁt beam search model was only 1.4× as repetitive as the initial model, down from a 2.3× relative
ampliﬁcation before the intervention. Sample outputs of all three models are provided in Appendix B.3.
While overﬁtting may match the frequency of punctuations, it may do so by memorizing the training data.
To test this, we measure the copy rate of model generations by calculating the overlap between 5-grams
of the model outputs and its training data, measured at round 0 without any data feedback. For the overﬁt
beam search model, 25% of model output 5-grams exist in the training data, while the rate was 11% for the
non-overﬁt beam search model and 2% for the nucleus sampling model. Thus, while it may be that the overﬁt
model is less diverse than the original models, it is still not simply memorizing and returning the training data.
While it is an open question whether such interpolating language models can be useful for real-world
applications, our experimental results are consistent with our earlier theoretical characterizations of stability
and suggest that approaches for improving calibration may be broadly useful for mitigating bias ampliﬁcation.

Conclusion
Large-scale machine learning and datasets scraped from the internet have been critical to many recent successes,
yet this very success puts the utility of future internet-derived datasets at risk, as model outputs begin to replace
human annotations and degrade the quality of internet data.
To study this tradeoff, we propose a new setting called data feedback, where past model outputs inﬂuence
training data in the future. We show that the natural decision to retrain a deployed model can increase
utility while also amplifying biases. We then provide conditions for stability (namely, consistent calibration)
and derive corresponding upper bounds on bias ampliﬁcation. The utility of these predictions is realized
by experiments in image classiﬁcation, visual role-labeling, and language modeling, which conﬁrm the
observation that sampling-like behaviors often result in better calibration and greater feedback stability. Finally,
we leverage our insight to design a mitigation strategy for unstable feedback systems.
Our results have important consequences for anyone participating in the creation or use of online data. For
model developers, our results can give upper bound predictions on the changes in model bias (or any other
statistic). For those who consume predictions from machine learning systems, our results provide the initial
groundwork for understanding how their interactions may change the systems they use over time.

Future work
Future work may extend the data feedback setting by relaxing some of its assumptions in order to more
accurately model real-world dynamics. For example, considering exogenous distribution shifts over time in
the human-labeled distribution P0 is important for capturing changing human behavior. Another extension
would be incorporating human-in-the-loop selection criteria for samples which are posted back online, as
not all model-labeled samples are recorded on the internet. Finally, one may consider data feedback loops
occurring between multiple different neural systems, such as the outputs of a machine translation system being
used as inputs for an image-text similarity model.
Work on potential mitigation strategies for unstable data feedback systems is also important. Watermarking
model outputs [65, 60] is one strategy for avoiding feedback from previous model-labeled samples. Developing
more effective ﬁlters, such as powerful discriminators that can detect between artiﬁcially generated and human-
created content [19], is another fruitful direction. Lastly, work on developing training algorithms that are
consistently calibrated [22, 35] is a crucial component to ensure feedback stability in the wild.

Additional related work
Semi-supervised learning.
The semi-supervised learning setting [45, 20], also widely referred to as self-
training, shares many similarities with the data feedback setting. Assuming access to an additional pool of
unlabeled data, a self-trained model iteratively labels parts of the data and retrains on its new predictions. In
contrast to data feedback, the unlabeled pool is typically ﬁxed at the start, and the model can selectively choose
which examples to use for training.
In most cases, self-training improves the utility of the overall model; however, prior work has found it may
have disparate effects across population subgroups [71]. In Section 5.2, we show a similar phenomenon in
data feedback; gender bias ampliﬁes differently for male-heavy and female-heavy subgroups of the data.
Domain adaptation.
Data feedback has connections to domain adaptation [15, 57, 36], where the changing
data distributions over time can be viewed as shifting target domains. The major difference between the
settings is that in data feedback, the model itself drives changes in the distribution, while in domain adaptation,
the shift in distribution is independent of the model. Due to this difference in the problem setting, it is an open
question how well domain adaptation techniques would transfer to data feedback.

Language model outputs
We provide sample model outputs for GPT2-small, generated with nucleus sampling in Table 1 and with beam
search in Table 2. When generating via beam search, model completions tend to be less ﬂuent and contain
many quotation marks and non-unicode characters. Sample outputs for an overﬁt GPT2-small, an intervention
designed to stabilize feedback, are provided in Table 3. Though still present, repitition and the overuse of

quotation marks is mitigated. All outputs are random samples from the test set, and sampled from the initial
round 0 model (i.e. without any data feedback).

Details on experiment settings
C.1
Image classiﬁcation
Datasets.
For most experiments, we use the ﬁrst 3 million images of the CIFAR-5m dataset, which contains 5
million examples synthetically generated by the DDPM diffusion generative model [28], which was originally
trained on the CIFAR-10 train set. The examples were then labeled by a BigTransfer classiﬁer [2], which has
98.5% accuracy on classifying CIFAR-10 images. We create a test set by randomly selecting 50k examples on
each new experiment run. For an ablation on non-synthetic data, we also use the CINIC-10 dataset [8], which
is an extension of CIFAR-10 by including downscaled ImageNet images.
Training hyperparameters.
For most experiments, we train a BaiduNet9 [39], which has 94% accuracy
when trained on CIFAR-10. We optimize the model using stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 512,
Nesterov momentum factor of 0.9, and weight decay of 0.256. The number of epochs trained is dependent
on dataset size: below 20k examples, we train for 63 epochs, then linearly scaled down to 50 epochs at 50k
examples, then linearly scaled down to 38 epochs at 100k examples, then linearly scaled down to 25 epochs
at 1m or more examples. We use a triangular learning rate: for the ﬁrst ﬁfth of training time, the learning
rate is scaled linearly up from 0 until 0.4 and then, for the rest of training time, scaled linearly back down to
0.001. We use data augmentation standard for CIFAR-10 training: random crops, horizontal ﬂips, and input
normalization during training time, and only input normalization during test time. We train with half precision.
For the ablation training an underﬁt BaiduNet9, we use the following learning rate schedule: train using a
learning rate of 0.1 for the ﬁrst 3 epochs, then decay linearly down to 0.01 during the fourth epoch, then ﬁnally
decay linearly down to 0.001 on the ﬁfth epoch. We only train for 5 epochs regardless of dataset size for the
underﬁt model.
For an ablation training a ResNet18, we train a ResNet18 adapted to CIFAR from this repository, and this
model has 95% CIFAR test accuracy. We train for twice the number of epochs as the regular BaiduNet9
training; that equates to 100 epochs at 50k dataset size and 50 epochs at dataset size of 1m or more. We
optimize the model using stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 128, momentum factor of 0.9, and
no weight decay. We use a cosine annealing schedule for the learning rate during training. We train using full
precision. All other parameters remain the same.
Hyperparameter tuning.
During data feedback, the model is retuned and retrained from scratch on the
growing dataset at each new round. Due to the computational complexity of re-tuning hyperparameters for
each data feedback experiment, we tune hyperparameters ahead of time for varying CIFAR-5m dataset sizes
(in this case, the examples are not relabeled by data feedback). During data feedback, we use the dataset size
to match the hyperparameter setting at each round.
For hyperparameter tuning, we trained the BaiduNet9 for [10, 20, 30, 45, 65] epochs on dataset sizes of
[20k, 50k, 100k, 200k, 500k, 1m]. We then chose the earliest number of epochs at which accuracy stopped
improving for each dataset size, and then interpolated the number of epochs for all dataset sizes in between.
Once the optimal number of epochs was found, we then tuned the batch size and learning rate, varying batch
size in [64, 128, 256, 512] and accordingly scaling the learning rate linearly; and found the maximum batch
size of 512 and corresponding learning rate of 0.4 worked best across all dataset size settings.
C.2
Visual role-labeling
Dataset.
The imSitu dataset provides three sets of annotations for each image. We collapse these annotations
into a single label for each role in each image via majority voting. We make this design choice to ﬁt the data
feedback setting, since model-labeled data points only have one annotation per image. We also combine all
data splits (train, dev, and test), and randomly sample 50 images per category (for a total of 25200 examples)
to create a test set for each new experiment run.
Training hyperparameters.
We train the default ResNet18-backed conditional random ﬁelds model [69].
We optimize the model using Adam [33] with batch size 64, learning rate 0.00001, default betas 0.9 and 0.999,
and weight decay of 0.0005. The number of epochs trained is dependent on dataset size: below 20k examples,
we train for 50 epochs, then linearly scaled down to 40 epochs at 35k examples, then linearly scaled down to
35 epochs at 50k examples, then linearly scaled down to 30 epochs at 75k or more examples. We use data
augmentation standard for ImageNet training: random resized crops, horizontal ﬂips, and input normalization
during training time, and resized center crop with input normalization during test time.
25

Hyperparameter tuning.
Similar to the CIFAR setting, we tune hyperparameters ahead of time for varying
dataset sizes (where the examples are not relabeled by data feedback). The optimization criterion was the
average score of ﬁve metrics calculated over the given dev set: verb classiﬁcation accuracy, role classiﬁcation
accuracy, role classiﬁcation accuracy conditioned on the correct verb, and two additional similar role classiﬁ-
cation metrics [69]. During data feedback, we then use the dataset size to match the hyperparameter setting at
each round.
For hyperparameter tuning, we trained the ResNet18 CRF for [20, 30, 45, 60] epochs on dataset sizes of
[20k, 50k, 75k, 100k]. We then chose the earliest number of epochs at which the average score stopped improv-
ing for each dataset size, and then interpolated the number of epochs for all dataset sizes in between. Once the
optimal number of epochs was found, we then tuned the learning rate in [0.000001, 0.00001, 0.001, 0.01] and
found the optimal to be 0.00001 for all dataset sizes.
C.3
Language modeling
Dataset.
We use the Real Toxicity Prompts dataset [17], which is a collection of 100k sentences from the
Open-WebText Corpus [18] stratiﬁed along varying levels of toxicity as predicted by the Perspective API
toxicity classiﬁer 5. We create a test set by randomly selecting 14442 examples on each new experiment run.
Toxicity metric.
Toxicity is measured by counting the fraction of model outputs classiﬁed as toxic by the
Detoxify classiﬁer, with one output per prompt. Our metric differs from that used in the Real Toxicity Prompts
paper [17], which measures the maximum toxicity over 25 independently sampled model generations for a
given prompt.
Models and tokenizers.
We ﬁnetune GPT2 small, medium, and large, initialized to the pretrained models
available on HuggingFace [67]. All text is tokenized using the default GPT2 tokenizer. For both nucleus
sampling and beach search, model output is capped at a maximum of 20 tokens, following the settings in [17].
Training hyperparameters.
We optimize each model using AdamW [40] with batch size 16, default betas
0.9 and 0.999, and no weight decay. For GPT2 small, the learning rate is set to 0.00005, and for medium and
large is set to 0.00001. The models are ﬁnetuned for one epoch regardless of dataset size. For the overﬁtting
intervention, the models are ﬁnetuned for 5 epochs, and the learning rate increased by a factor of 10 (to 0.0005
for GPT-2 small and 0.0001 for GPT-2 medium and large).
Hyperparameter tuning.
Similar to the CIFAR and imSitu settings, we tune hyperparameters ahead of time
for varying dataset sizes (where the examples are not relabeled by data feedback). The optimization criterion
is model perplexity of test set sentence continuations conditioned on their respective prompts. During data
feedback, we then use the dataset size to match the hyperparameter setting at each round.
For hyperparameter tuning, we trained each GPT2 small, medium, and large model using a very dense sampling
of the following hyperparameter combinations: [1, 2, 3, 5] epochs, [20k, 35k, 50k, 65k, 85k] dataset sizes,
[0.000001, 0.000005, 0.00001, 0.00005, 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001] learning rates, and [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
batch sizes. We found that across dataset sizes, training for 1 epoch with batch size 16, with learning rate
0.00005 for GPT2 small and 0.00001 for medium and large was optimal or very near optimal.

and therefore the bound from Theorem 1 (which only holds in expectation) is no longer a strict
upper bound (see right plot).

Stability analysis proofs
E.1
Notation
First, we note that the training distribution Pt, deﬁned recursively via Pt = nt−1
nt Pt−1 + m
nt P0 + k
nt bP(ft−1),
is a random variable, as it is a function of random variables ft−1 and Pt−1 and deterministic P0.
Second, denote Eft[·] := EP1:t,f0:t[·] := Ef0,P1,f1,... Pt,ft[·] as a shorthand for the expectation over all random
objects up to time t during data feedback. Here, the randomness in fi is both over the draw in dataset Si as
well as randomness in the learning algorithm A.
E.2
Proof of Theorem 1
We ﬁrst show that consistent calibration with respect to base distribution P0 implies calibration at each step of
data feedback.
Lemma E.1. Let A be (δn, φ, P0(x), n)-consistently calibrated, where δn is a function of dataset size n.
Then, under data feedback, for each time t,
Eft

Ptφ −bP0(ft)φ | Pt
 ≤δnt.
Proof
By deﬁnition of the data feedback model, the covariate marginal does not change throughout data
feedback, and Pt(x) = P0(x) for all t. Thus, conditioned on a particular Pt, we have that A is (δnt, φ, Pt(x),
nt)-consistently calibrated. Applying the consistent calibration deﬁnition gives
Eft

Ptφ −bPt(ft)φ | Pt
 ≤
δnt, where Pt is ﬁxed inside the conditional expectation. Finally, we obtain the claim of the Lemma by noting
that bPt(ft) = bP0(ft), because bPt depends on Pt only through the marginal covariate distribution, which is
identical between Pt and P0.
Now, are ready to prove Theorem 1.
Proof
The general proof strategy is to ﬁrst bound the bias ampliﬁcation of model ft in terms of the bias
ampliﬁcation of its training distribution Pt, and then bound the bias ampliﬁcation of Pt in terms of the previous
training distribution Pt−1. This will lead to a recursive formula that we can solve.
We begin by bounding bias ampliﬁcation of ft in terms of the bias ampliﬁcation of Pt.
Eft

Equation (1) uses triangle inequality, Equation (2) uses the iterated expectation equality and the fact that ft is
conditionally independent of P1:t−1, f0:t−1 given Pt, and Equation (3) uses Lemma E.1.
Now, we will bound the bias ampliﬁcation of Pt in terms of Pt−1.

P0φ −EP1:t,f0:t−1

Ptφ
, we therefore have that bt ≤nt−m
nt
bt−1 + k
nt δnt−1, with b0 = 0.
Unrolling the recursion, we have that
bt ≤

Substituting the above into Equation (3), we have that

By assumption, δnt ≤δn0 for all t, and so we arrive at the result

Stating Distributional Generalization
Conjecture 1 (Feature Calibration [42]). Let T : [m] × Y →R be any bounded function. If L is a (δ, A,
P(x), n)-distinguishable feature, then for any joint distribution Q(x, y) with marginal P(x),
ES∼Qn,f∼A(S),(x,y)∼Q

T(L(x), y) −T(L(x), f(x))
 ≤δ.

By Conjecture 1, for any joint Q(x, y) with marginal P(x),
