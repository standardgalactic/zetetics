Trends in Explainable AI (XAI) Literature
ALON JACOVI, Bar Ilan University, Israel
The XAI literature is decentralized, both in terminology and in publication venues, but recent years saw the community converge around
keywords that make it possible to more reliably discover papers automatically. We use keyword search using the SemanticScholar
API and manual curation to collect a well-formatted and reasonably comprehensive set of 5199 XAI papers, available at https:
//github.com/alonjacovi/XAI-Scholar. We use this collection to clarify and visualize trends about the size and scope of the literature,
citation trends, cross-field trends, and collaboration trends. Overall, XAI is becoming increasingly multidisciplinary, with relative
growth in papers belonging to increasingly diverse (non-CS) scientific fields, increasing cross-field collaborative authorship, increasing
cross-field citation activity. The collection can additionally be used as a paper discovery engine, by retrieving XAI literature which is
cited according to specific constraints (for example, papers that are influential outside of their field, or influential to non-XAI research).

INTRODUCTION
This is a report on the collection methodology and analysis of XAI-Scholar, a set of XAI1 papers collected as of December
31st 2022. All data and reproduction code are available at https://github.com/alonjacovi/XAI-Scholar.
In recent years the “explainable AI” body of research has started to reach a size that makes it (1) difficult to grasp
with manual surveying; (2) large enough that it’s possible to see overall empirical and statistical trends. The goal of
this report is to collect a large and well-formatted set of XAI papers to make this empirical analysis possible. The
report mostly observes cross-field and multi-disciplinary trends in XAI. We invite others to use the collection for other
purposes as well.
Challenges.
XAI research has several properties that make it difficult to observe in its entirety, compared to many
other adjacent fields in Computer Science:
(1) It is multidisciplinary, with non-negligible communities in many different fields that do not often interact or
share venues.
(2) The terminology that papers use to self-identify as XAI research is not unique to XAI (E.g., “xai” and “Xai Xai”
are names with multiple senses which appear in research), and this terminology is much more recent than the
actual history of XAI.
(3) The most prevalent definitions of “XAI research” papers often include papers that don’t self-identify as XAI, as
long as they research how to explain AI technology.
Findings.
Below is a brief partial summary of findings from the analysis. Most trends are situated around Computer
Science (CS), being the primary field of study for XAI research.
(1) XAI research has had its biggest “expansion” growth spikes outside of Computer Science in 2016, 2018 and 2021.
(2) There is clear growth over time in the relative proportion of papers by authors that traditionally publish in two
or more distinct fields of study.
(3) CS has different citing relationships with different XAI fields. For example, XAI-CS cites XAI-Psychology more
often than the vice versa, but the relationship flips for XAI-CS and XAI-Medicine. This “direction” of influence
shows which fields often inform which fields in the current literature.
1By XAI we refer to a relatively inclusive definition for research articles that discuss the development, implementation, or practice, of explana-
tions/interpretations in “AI” systems (even if those articles don’t refer to their work as explanations, or to their systems as AI systems, as long as they are
treated as such by others). This definition is aligned with what we’ve observed in various curated lists, workshops and journal issues of XAI literature.

(4) There is a difference across XAI fields by how often they inform non-XAI research, the highest proportion
being in XAI-Biology, XAI-Engineering and XAI-Law—while the lowest proportion being in XAI-Psychology,
XAI-Business and XAI-Philosophy, whose influence more often carries to other XAI literature.
(5) Citation behavior across papers is significantly different between fields. For example, the top-cited Philosophy
papers cited by XAI-Philosophy are significantly different from those cited by XAI-CS, and so on. Unsurprisingly,
papers outside of a field tend to focus on a smaller variety of papers in that field, but the papers that “break out
of” the traditional boundaries of their field are not always the most cited papers in that field.
(6) The collection can serve as a paper discovery engine by observing which XAI papers, for example, are the most
influential to papers outside of their field, or outside of XAI; or which non-XAI papers of a particular field are the
most informative to another field. Tables with examples of these selections are shown at the end of this report,
and more are available in the accompanying github repository.

DATA COLLECTION
2.1
Methodology
The collection phase involved five steps.
Step 1: Keyword-based search (3101 papers total).
We derive a set of keywords in a (manual) iterative process to
maximize recall while not compromising near-perfect precision. The keywords are matched against both the title and
abstract together. Due to problems with filtering papers with 1 keyword match, we only collect papers that match 2
keywords or more. A random sample of 100 papers yielded 99% precision.
The keywords are: xai, (xai), hcxai, explainability, interpretability, explainable ai, explainable artificial intelligence,
interpretable ml, interpretable machine learning, interpretable model, feature attribution, feature importance, global
explanation, local explanation, local interpretation, global interpretation, model explanation, model interpretation, saliency,
counterfactual explanation.
Step 2: Manually curated collections (+ 766; 3867 papers total).
We collected the titles of papers from various
curated XAI collections [1–4, 6–14] and matched them using the SemanticScholar API with fuzzy matching.
Step 3: Citation tree expansion with manual filtering (+ 648; 4515 papers total).
We took the 2000 most cited
papers by the set of papers collected in the previous steps, and manually selected XAI papers from them.
Step 4: Citation tree expansion with automatic filtering (+ 709; 5224 papers total).
We used the citations and
references of all collected papers and filtered them via the 2-keyword-match method from step 1. We repeated this until
no new papers were added.
Step 5: Manual quality check (- 25; 5119 papers total).
Finally, we heuristically found 25 incorrectly-attributed
papers in the set, which we removed from the collection.

Limitations.
Any insight derived from the collection should account for margin of error based on these limitations:
(1) The data in the collection is noisy as can be expected from a large-scale research database. This includes missing
fields, inconsistent venue names, some incorrect details, and so on. While this is the minority, it is not negligible.
(2) It’s likely that the collection still contains a very small amount of non-XAI papers, despite our efforts.
(3) The collection methodology is biased towards CS, influential papers and papers that self-identify as XAI with the
keywords that we used. Of course, it’s likely that many XAI papers were missed, in particular less-cited papers
and papers which use different terminology.
(4) The collection was retrieved over a period of time in December 2022. Due to delay in proceedings release for
some venues, it may be necessary to consider 2022 a partial year.

GROWTH TRENDS
Figure 2 shows yearly growth in three settings. First, XAI generally shows relative yearly growth—but this growth is
largely controlled by Computer Science (which shows the same growth trend).
Controlling for non-CS papers reveals different growth trends. For example, XAI-Medicine shows exponential
growth, in particular with large relative growth in 2016, 2018 and 2021. These trends also hold when controlling for
non-Medicine and non-CS papers (bottom plot). Overall, it appears that XAI has had the biggest growth into non-central
fields in 2016, 2018 and 2021.
4
COLLABORATION TRENDS
We define the field of study for an author as the field of study for a majority of their papers (retrieved separately via the
SemanticScholar API). Given this definition, we can define a “collaboration” as the existence of two authors for the
same paper assigned two different fields of study.
Figure 3 shows the most common field pairings. As CS controls the scale, we show a graph that omits CS for a
perspective on multi-field research between non-CS fields.
Figure 4 shows yearly absolute and relative growth for papers with at at least two different fields, via their authors,
out of all yearly papers. If we consider 2016 as an outlier, the trends show a clear relative growth in cross-field XAI
research.
5
CITATION TRENDS
This section investigates the interaction between the citation graph in XAI-Scholar and the fields of study variable.
5.1
Computer Science
Figure 5 shows the distribution of citations by field by XAI-CS literature. Unsurprisingly XAI-CS appears to be
significantly informed by XAI-Mathematics, but XAI-Medicine, XAI-Psychology, XAI-Engineering and XAI-Business
also have a non-negligible presence.
Figure 6 shows the citation relationship between XAI-CS and other XAI fields as a directed weighted graph. Every
pair of edges is normalized to 100% to show which of the two XAI fields is informed more by the other. We can observe
that XAI-CS more often cites (vs. is cited by) XAI-Psychology and XAI-Mathematics, while the same is not true for the
other fields (XAI-Engineering and XAI-Engineering being roughly equal, and the rest overwhelmingly citing XAI-CS).

Citation Trends Outside of Computer Science
As before we can omit XAI-CS in order to probe into relationships between other fields. Figure 7 shows a cross-field
citation graph where all outgoing edges from a node are normalized to sum to 100%, to show which XAI fields are most
cited by a particular XAI field.
5.3
Citation Trends Between XAI and non-XAI
Figure 8 show the ranking of XAI fields by the percentage of non-XAI citations out of all citations to that XAI field.
This plot shows which fields most often inform non-XAI literature. For example, XAI-Biology is relatively often cited
by non-XAI literature, and the opposite is true for XAI-Philosophy, which seems to be comparatively more often cited
by XAI.

PAPER-LEVEL CITATION TRENDS AND PAPER DISCOVERY
Finally we can look at citation behavior at the level of individual papers. For example, when XAI-CS cites Philosophy,
are they citing a wide variety of papers, or a select minority of papers? Table 1 shows the top cited papers in Philosophy
by XAI-CS, which control 32% of the citations between these fields. More generally, Figure 9 shows the entropy across
paper citations for every field as cited by XAI-CS. The field with the most extreme distribution is Law, which as shown
in Table 2, is due to one paper—“Accountable Algorithms”—being overwhelmingly the most cited paper in Law by
XAI-CS. Table 3 and Table 4 show additional examples for top papers in Psychology and CS as cited by XAI-CS.
Other discovery constraints include:
(1) Which papers in a particular field are the most cited by XAI papers of that field? (e.g., Tables 5 and 6)
(2) What are the XAI papers that are the most cited by papers outside of their field? (e.g., Tables 7 to 9)
(3) What XAI papers in a particular field are most cited in that field?
(4) And so on.

CONCLUSIONS
XAI research is converging around specific terminology at scale that makes it possible to observe trends empirically.
While the retrieval process has some limitations that result in a margin of error, it’s possible to account for them on
some level (for example, by acknowledging that the retrieval is biased towards Computer Science and seeing trends that
overcome this bias in the opposite direction). The analysis in this work mostly focused on the field of study variable,
though it is possible to look at many other trends given this collection, as has been explored for other fields [5].
