Contemporary conceptualizations of infant cognitive 
development focus on predictive processes as a basic 
and powerful underlying mechanism for infant learning 
(see comprehensive recent review in Köster et al., 2020), 
and some researchers have claimed that such predic-
tions are based on Bayesian principles (Perfors et al., 
2011). This view follows a modern philosophical and 
neuro-computational conceptualization of the brain as 
a predicting machine (Clark, 2016) that provides a unify-
ing framework for all psychological phenomena. The 
basic idea is that the brain continuously creates predic-
tions about what is expected and that the divergence 
between predicted and actual perceived data yields a 
prediction error. This prediction error updates the model 
from which the predictions are generated and therefore 
is a basic mechanism for learning and adaptation to the 
dynamics of the ever-changing environment. According 
to Friston (2010), the brain’s hierarchical organization 
and the existence of forward and backward connections 
fit perfectly with the idea that predictions can be formed 
at every level of the hierarchy. Predictions are feedfor-
warded to lower levels in the hierarchy, and prediction 
errors can be fed backward to higher levels in the 
hierarchy and improve the current predictive model on 
which the prior predictions were based. Accordingly, 
the primary brain-functioning principle is to minimize 
free energy, which is the information-theoretic equiva-
lent of overall prediction error (Friston, 2010). The 
implementation of these concepts as a computational 
framework for cognitive development brought a modern 
twist to Piaget’s constructivist ideas of adaptation and 
accommodation (Johnson & Munakata, 2005), giving 
rise to what some researchers termed “rational construc-
tivism” (Gopnik & Wellman, 2012). This new perspective 
postulates that children infer causal structure from sta-
tistical probabilistic information and Bayesian learning 
through their own actions on the world and through 
observations of the actions of others.
Recent research has provided highly interesting and 
significant empirical evidence supporting the claims that 
predictive processes can be found in infancy. In this

Abstract
Contemporary conceptualizations on infant cognitive development focus on predictive processes; the basic idea is 
that the brain continuously creates predictions about what is expected and that the divergence between predicted and 
actual perceived data yields a prediction error. This prediction error updates the model from which the predictions 
are generated and therefore is a basic mechanism for learning and adaptation to the dynamics of the ever-changing 
environment. In this article, we review the types of available empirical evidence supporting the idea that predictive 
processes can be found in infancy, especially emphasizing the contribution of electrophysiology as a potential method 
for testing the similarity of the brain mechanisms for processing prediction errors in infants to those of adults. In 
infants, as with older children, adolescents, and adults, predictions involve synchronization bursts of middle-central 
theta reflecting brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. We discuss how early in development such brain 
mechanisms develop and open questions that still remain to be empirically investigated.

article, we review the types of available evidence in this 
respect, especially emphasizing the contribution of elec-
trophysiology as a method for testing how similar the 
brain mechanisms of processing prediction errors in 
infants are to those of adults and how early in develop-
ment such brain mechanisms develop. These issues are 
fundamental because prediction errors have been shown 
to be relevant for enhancing learning, for example, by 
increasing the infant’s exploration of the “surprising” 
object and influencing their learning rate (Sim & Xu, 
2017; Stahl & Feigenson, 2017). Prediction errors could 
be the basic mechanism for adapting the brain at early 
stages of development because top-down predictions 
are fed forward from areas such as the prefrontal cortex 
and may have a direct role in shaping the functional-
response properties of lower perceptual areas such as 
the posterior visual cortex (Johnson, 2020). The relevant 
literature is currently quite scattered, although recently, 
some of its aspects have been separately reviewed. We 
point out and refer to such previous reviews of specific 
topics. Still, a more comprehensive organization of the 
extant literature is still missing, especially regarding the 
neural evidence for infant prediction errors, which we 
review in the present article. The accumulating empiri-
cal evidence is compelling, but there are still many open 
questions that remain to be answered; at the end of the 
article, we delineate some of the main ones.
What Infants’ Eyes Tell Researchers: 
Behavioral Evidence for Infant 
Predictions
Violation-of-expectation (VoE) paradigms are powerful 
and widely used tools for studying infants’ basic under-
standing about the physical and social world (see 
review in Köster et al., 2020). Infants orient toward 
events that violate their expectations regarding physical 
or social rules (whether these “priors” were based on 
“core knowledge” that the infant possessed or were 
acquired during the initial phase of the experiment). 
The basic VoE finding is that infants look longer at 
“impossible” events, that is, a display that violates a 
“rule.” Beginning in the 1980s with pioneer studies 
about object permanence (e.g., Baillargeon et al., 1985), 
this basic effect has been used for more than 40 years 
to learn about the basic expectations that infants have 
about the rules governing physical objects, actions, 
number, space, social agents (Spelke & Kinzler, 2007), 
and much more (see review of this literature in Stahl 
& Feigenson, 2017). Although, infant looking times in 
VoE paradigms are sensitive not only to novelty but 
also to familiarity, complexity, and informativeness and 
should not be considered exclusively as an index of 
prediction error (Zhang & Emberson, 2020). A series of 
recent studies have further modeled the patterns of 
infant looking times in VoE contexts beyond a basic 
dichotomy between “possible” and “impossible” events 
using a combination of empirical research and compu-
tational models (e.g., Kidd et al., 2012; Piantadosi et al., 
2014; Teglas et al., 2007, 2011). These studies provided 
compelling behavioral evidence for prediction process-
ing in infants. These articles were recently reviewed by 
Sim and Xu (2019), who concluded that looking times 
can be reconceptualized as reflecting “sophisticated 
statistical inference, captured by Bayesian probabilistic 
models.” In other words, longer looking times reflect 
prediction errors when the infant is faced with informa-
tion that is incongruent with the “current” mental 
model, meaning that infants’ looking times are well 
predicted by the probability of observed events.
Infant predictive processing in VoE tasks has also 
been studied using pupil size, gaze direction, and latency. 
A recent review of this literature can be found in Zhang 
and Emerson (2020). A relevant and compelling study 
using pupillometry as an index of prediction errors was 
conducted by Zhang et al. (2019). This study compared 
adults’ and 6-month-old infants’ pupil-dilatation changes 
when previously learned associations between sounds 
and pictures were violated. Both infants and adults 
showed larger comparative changes in pupil size for 
trials that elicited prediction errors, that is, trials in which 
the visual stimulus that should have followed the paired 
auditory cue was omitted, compared with trials that con-
firmed the participants’ predictions that were established 
in the initial “implicit learning” phase of the audiovisual 
associations. As for studies of infants’ predictions using 
anticipatory gaze direction, one clear example is the 
study by Romberg and Saffran (2013) with 12-month-old 
infants in which they measured anticipatory eye move-
ments to targets that appeared in one of two possible 
locations and found that the infants adjusted their predic-
tions to reflect changes in the target location on the 
previous trial and that such flexibility was more pro-
nounced in infants with more variable prior experience 
regarding target locations. In other words, infants’ antici-
patory behavior reflected their prior experience. More-
over, the individual differences in such flexibility and 
adaptability of anticipatory looking behavior at an early 
age seemed to be related to and to predict individual 
differences in language acquisition. This was later shown 
in a longitudinal study by Reuter et al. (2018; i.e., in 
vocabulary size), suggesting a causal role in learning, 
which is in line with error-based models of learning (see 
also Mani & Huettig, 2012). In this context, note that 
prediction processes have not solely been studied in 
infants regarding predictions of location or perceptual 
features of objects, but in fact, evidence supporting the

ability of infants to extract statistical information and 
generate predictions, accordingly, has become domi-
nant in the modern literature on language development 
(Golinkoff et al., 2013) and the developmental literature 
on perception and interpretation of the actions of  
others (Daum et al., 2012; Gredebäck & Daum, 2015; 
Gredebäck et al., 2018; Kayhan, Heil, et al., 2019, and 
more). Overall, as summarized by Köster et al. (2020),
the PP [predictive processing] perspective offers 
a plausible explanation for infants’ VoE responses 
across social and physical knowledge domains. 
VoE responses indicate infants’ processing of pre-
diction errors, which require them to refine prior 
predictions (i.e., update their predictive models) 
or, put more simply, learning. (p. 566)
The Predicting Brain
The brain structures related to prediction errors have 
been empirically studied using electrophysiological 
methods in human adults (Cavanagh & Frank, 2014) 
and primates (Phillips et al., 2014; Womelsdorf et al., 
2010). Here we briefly review the adult mechanisms in 
order to compare them with what is present in infancy. 
For a more complete review of this extensive adult 
literature, see Alexander and Brown (2019).
Middle-frontal theta activity (4–8 Hz) has long been 
known to be elicited in situations requiring cognitive 
control (novelty, conﬂict, punishment, and error). This 
activity is reflected in a series of extensively studied 
event-related-potential (ERP) components of negative 
voltage polarity that can be measured at middle-frontal 
scalp areas. These include: the ERN (error-related nega-
tivity), which appears approximately 100 ms post 
incorrect responses (Hajcak et al., 2005); the FRN  
(feedback-related negativity), which appears at about the 
same time and at the same scalp localization as the ERN, 
and also has the same wave-form pattern as the ERN, 
but it appears following negative feedback (Miltner et al., 
1997) and is thought to encode a quantitative reward 
prediction error (Walsh & Anderson, 2012); the N2 (second 
negative peak in the averaged ERP waveform), which 
appears around 200 ms from stimulus appearance and 
is mainly related to novelty or stimulus–response conflict 
(Cavanagh & Frank, 2014); and the N400, a negativity 
wave that peaks at about 400 ms following the appear-
ance of semantically incongruent stimuli (Hanslmayr  
et al., 2008; Mesika et al., 2014).  All of these ERP com-
ponents seem to reflect bursts of phase-synchronization 
theta activity, leading to an increase of power in this 
frequency band, broadly signalizing deviations between 
expected and observed events (Cavanagh et al., 2012; 
Cavanagh & Frank, 2014; Luu et al., 2003). This theta 
activity seems to be elicited mainly “by” and “in” the 
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the main brain region 
considered to be strongly involved in monitoring and 
cognitive control (Botvinick et  al., 2001, 2004; Bush 
et al., 2000; Cohen & Cavanagh, 2011; Gehring & Fencsik, 
2001; Kerns, 2004; Mathalon et  al., 2003; Rushworth 
et al., 2004). It then propagates to more distal locations, 
such as perceptual and motor brain areas (Cavanagh & 
Frank, 2014), becoming critical for learning (Cavanagh 
et al., 2010; Crivelli-Decker et al., 2018; Mas-Herrero & 
Marco-Pallarés, 2014). The functional correlation between 
cognitive-control processes and theta-band activity pro-
ceeding from the ACC has also been demonstrated in 
children (Adam et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2019), adoles-
cents (Buzzell et al., 2019), and nonhuman species using 
single-cell recordings (e.g., in macaques; e.g., Womelsdorf 
et al., 2010). Alexander and Brown (2019) suggested that 
the ACC has a broad role in computing a hierarchically 
structured surprise signal that is critical for learning mod-
els of the environment. According to the suggested model, 
prediction-error computations engage forwarding of error 
information up the hierarchy and prediction information 
(in the form of expected prediction error) downward. 
Such a model of the functioning of the neocortex is fully 
compatible with Friston’s (2010) ideas that were presented 
above at the beginning of this article.
Consistent with these ideas, the increase in theta 
power seems to be proportional to the degree of devia-
tion from the expectations. In a series of studies (Tzur 
& Berger, 2007, 2009; Tzur et al., 2010), the brain reaction 
to VoE was explored using correct and incorrect arith-
metic equations. The middle-frontal theta reaction to the 
erroneous solutions to the simple equations was sensi-
tive to the error salience or magnitude; that is, stronger 
theta activity was found with larger or more deviant 
errors (e.g., 1 + 2 = 8) than with smaller or less deviant 
ones (e.g., 1 + 2 = 4). This brain activity was source-
localized to the ACC (Tzur & Berger, 2009). Moreover, 
the time-frequency decomposition analyses indicated 
that theta activity was modulated by the magnitude of 
erroneous information in a nonlinear fashion in accord 
with Weber–Fechner’s logarithmic function or Stevens’s 
power functions (Tzur et al., 2010). In more modern 
“predicting brain” terms, the middle-frontal theta activity 
in the brain reflects the degree of the prediction error. 
Further studies suggested that the ACC signals should 
be more accurately defined as “unsigned” prediction 
errors reflecting the degree of “surprise” regardless of 
valence (Mas-Herrero & Marco-Pallarés, 2014).
Note that predictions can also occur at lower levels 
of the brain (e.g., locally at sensory areas). At sensory 
areas, the mismatch negativity (MMN) is the most stud-
ied ERP brain prediction error signaling the automatic 
detection of a deviation of perceptual features (e.g., in 
vision, unexpected spatial frequency, orientation, 
movement direction). A comprehensive review of the

predictive-coding view of the MMN, especially in the 
visual domain, can be found in Stefanics et al. (2014), 
however, this type of predictions is outside the scope 
of the present review.
Neural Evidence for Prediction Errors 
in Infants
Following the findings in children, adolescents, and 
adults, tracing the development of prediction from 
infancy may serve to help understand the role of pre-
diction in perception and action. This issue may be 
examined by tracing the origin and development of the 
neuronal activity found in the mature brain when the 
predictions of infants are violated. Using an adapted 
version of a classical VoE paradigm (Wynn, 1992), we 
(Berger et al., 2006) measured and analyzed the brain 
activity, as well as looking behavior, of a sample of 
6- to 9-month-old infants presented with a videotaped 
series of “puppet” trials, including correct and incorrect 
solutions to simple arithmetic equations (see Fig. 1). At 
the behavioral level, Wynn’s (1992) looking-time VoE 
effect was replicated—the infants looked longer at 
incorrect solutions than at correct ones. At the brain-
activity level, ERPs time-locked, at the same electrode 
locations in which such activity was found in adults, to 
the presentation of the solution also differed between 
conditions, with greater negative activity for the incor-
rect solution condition. The similarity between the 
infant and adult neural reactions to the perceived errors 
was striking in terms of both the topography and fre-
quency of this activity. Although, there were also under-
standable differences in the magnitude of the effects 
(given the larger overall amplitude of the electroen-
cephalogram [EEG] waves in infants) and their timing 
(which was slightly slower in the infants). These ERP 
findings were replicated and expanded on a different

7-month-old infant sample, including a time-frequency 
analysis that delineated the frequency of the effect, 
indicating that it was in the theta range (i.e., between 
6 and 7 Hz; Berger et al., 2019). The 6- to 7-Hz band 
for middle-central response to perceived error was also 
found in a study with toddlers (Conejero et al., 2018). 
In this study, 16- to 18-month-olds observed the assem-
bling of three-piece puzzles of pictures of an animal 
(e.g., a chicken) that were being formed either correctly 
or incorrectly (e.g., after the first two pieces built a 
body of a chicken, the third top part was of a head of 
an elephant). Observation of incorrect configurations 
produced increased potentials in midline channels and 
greater power of 6- to 7-Hz activity.
Increase of theta power at fronto-central electrodes 
and larger amplitudes have also been found for predic-
tions and anticipations of actions in 9-month-olds when 
presented with simple action sequences completed in 
an unexpected way (e.g., the action of eating ended by 
placing food in the ear instead of the mouth; Reid et al., 
2009; although their 7-month-olds did not show the 
effect). In this case, the ERP component for which the 
amplitudes were calculated was defined as an N400. 
Following this study, Kaduk et al. (2016) showed that 
individual differences in these effects in infants at 9 
months of age were related to language productive pro-
ficiency at 18 months. We note several issues regarding 
the findings in these two studies. First, as is typical in 
infant ERP data when compared with adult data, the 
time window of the N400 that they found was later for 
infants relative to adults. Second, for the infants, the 
scalp localization of the N400 was more parietal, and 
the researchers suggested that this was because it was 
masked in frontal and central sites by the large negative 
component (Nc) that was induced by the stimuli (see 
also Monroy et al., 2019). The Nc is an ERP component 
of negative voltage largely studied in infants in response 
to novel/unfamiliar/unpredicted stimuli (Kayhan, Meyer, 
et al., 2019; Langeloh et al., 2020; Luyster et al., 2014; 
Monroy et al., 2019; Peykarjou et al., 2020), commonly 
but not exclusively in the context of face perception. At 
young ages, it is located in the middle-central area of 
the brain and is mostly evident at the Cz electrode scalp 
location, although some studies report increasing right-
lateralization with age (Luyster et al., 2014).
A more recent interesting ERP study on VoE in agent 
actions was conducted by Langeloh et al. (2020). They 
assessed infants’ ERPs when presented with videos 
showing a model performing unusual and inefficient 
actions (e.g., turning on a lamp with the forehead as 
opposed to turning it on with the hand), adapting the 
well-known behavioral paradigm first introduced by 
Meltzoff (1988). They analyzed the amplitudes of the 
same two ERP components mentioned above, however, 
they measured both at the same middle-central location: 
the Nc component in an earlier time window (400–600 
ms), which they considered to reflect the amount of 
attentional engagement (Reynolds & Richards, 2005), 
and the “N400-like” component in a slower window 
(736–868 ms), which they considered to reflect the reac-
tion to the semantic violation. In this case, it was found 
that 12- to 14-month-olds’ but not 9-month-olds’ expec-
tations were violated; in other words, the younger 
infants were “surprised” when observing an inefficient 
action, as indicated by increased Nc and N400-like 
amplitudes.
Recent studies by Köster and colleagues (2019, 2021) 
found that for 9-month-old infants, the increase in theta 
brain activity to stimuli that violated their expectations 
lasted a few seconds (in these studies, the usual immedi-
ate ERP amplitude effect at about 200 ms was not found). 
Köster et al. (2019, 2021) tested four different core knowl-
edge domains in which looking-time VoE effects have 
been demonstrated—action, number, solidity, and cohe-
sion. The researchers interpreted the infant theta middle-
central response to erroneous information that violated 
the infants’ expectations as reflecting prediction errors. 
The fact that the same brain response to the unexpected 
stimulus was found in all of the four tested domains sup-
ports the idea of a broad general mechanism eliciting the 
prediction response. Moreover, the theta-rhythm effect 
was general over the brain, in particular over parietal 
areas. This finding may fit well with the early develop-
ment and importance of the parietal orienting network 
as a control system during infancy (Posner et al., 2014).
Note that a relationship between frontal theta activity 
and learning has been demonstrated in infancy (Begus 
et al., 2015). In the study of Begus et al. (2015), the 
EEG activity was collected while 11-month-old infants 
explored new objects. The researchers found that theta 
power predicted the infants’ subsequent recognition of 
these objects in a preferential-looking test. For a com-
prehensive review about the involvement of theta oscil-
lations in active learning in infancy, including sustained 
attention, self-controlled attention, and self-guided 
object exploration, see Begus and Bonawitz (2020).
In sum, there is consistent EEG/ERP evidence relat-
ing middle-frontal theta to prediction errors in infants; 
although some clear inconsistencies should be noticed 
between the studies, such as some differences in the 
reported frequency ranges of the effects reported in 
different studies. For example, Berger et al. (2019) 
reported theta activity at a frequency of 6 to 7 Hz, 
Köster et al. (2021) reported theta activity at 4 to 5 Hz, 
Reid et al. (2009) and Begus et al. (2015) reported theta 
activity at 3 to 5 Hz, and so on. Some of these variations 

6	
Berger, Posner
can probably be explained by the differences in the 
paradigms that these studies used (videos vs. visually 
entrained oscillations vs. live object explorations; visual, 
audiovisual), domains (prediction of basic features such 
as color and location; number; action sequences; action 
efficacy), and more. To provide a more coherent picture 
of prediction processes in infancy, these differences 
should not be ignored, and they certainly call for fur-
ther research. Orekhova et al. (2006) suggested that 
there might be a shift in the specific frequency bound-
aries of the theta wave involved in exploration behavior 
and cognitive control, from 3.6 to 5.6 Hz in infancy to 
4 to 8 Hz from preschool and on, which definitely 
deserves further investigation. Still, it seems safe to 
claim at this point that there is substantial electrophysi-
ological data in 6-month-old and older infants support-
ing the idea that middle-central theta activity proceeding 
from the anterior cingulate reflects prediction errors, 
similar to what is found in adults. This activity is sup-
posed to be feedforwarded to sensory areas and affects 
perception and learning.
In the literature on adults, there is a distinction 
between the source of attention control and the site at 
which it operates (Petersen & Posner, 2012). We have 
argued that a likely source is the ACC, and among the 
sensory sites at which it operates is the posterior occipi-
tal cortex. Although there is no available direct evi-
dence that ties together the whole idea in infants, there 
is a study by Kouider et al. (2015) with 12-month-old 
infants that looked at the neurophysiological effect of 
the prediction in the occipital perceptual areas. The 
first phase of the study was a learning phase in which 
they created cross-modal associations, pairing between 
sounds (sounds A, B) and visual stimuli (flowers, faces). 
In the test phase of the study, the infants heard the 
sound and then the picture was presented, but in 25% 
of the trials, the picture was of the wrong category, that 
is, it induced a prediction error. At about 1,000 ms after 
stimulus onset, the overall activity at posterior brain 
areas (i.e., the ERP amplitude at these electrode sites, 
reflecting the perceptual processing of the stimuli) was 
enhanced for the unexpected stimuli. This enhance-
ment was interpreted by the researchers as reflecting 
the attention and processing created by the surprise. 
This effect was preceded, at an earlier time following 
the stimulus presentation, by an opposite enhanced 
processing of the expected stimuli, that is, the ampli-
tude of the P1 component was enhanced for the 
expected stimuli. Such early enhanced processing of 
the expected stimuli, which was in the opposite direc-
tion of the late and longer-lasting processing of the 
unexpected surprising stimuli, was attributed by the 
researchers to the cross-modal paradigm-cuing manipu-
lation used in this study.
Development of Neural Connectivity 
Supporting Prediction Errors
Resting-state MRI has revealed evidence for a midpre-
frontal node of activity at the ACC, present even in 
newborns (Gao et al., 2015, 2017). However, this area 
shows little connectivity to other brain areas until later 
in development (Gao et al., 2011). The slow develop-
ment of longer brain connections may reflect on the 
ability of activity in the ACC to influence sensory and 
motor behavior. Specifically, a question arises regarding 
the ages at which the connections in the infant brain 
could be mature enough to support prediction-error 
information being feedforwarded to posterior visual 
brain areas. A recent study of visual perception in 
infants by Nakashima et al. (2021) relates to the young-
est age at which the infant brain is developed enough 
to enable prediction-error information to be feedfor-
warded to sensory areas, altering perception and influ-
encing learning. In this study, 3- to 9-month-old infants 
were presented masked visual objects. A target object 
was either presented simultaneously with a mask or 
after a delay. In adults, the delayed mask prevents per-
ception of the target, but the simultaneous mask does 
not. Only the 7- to 8-month-old infants showed evi-
dence of such pattern masking. The younger infants 
looked longer at face targets in both simultaneous and 
delayed conditions. The authors concluded that younger 
infants were able to distinguish the presence of a face 
even under a condition in which adults could not. The 
authors interpreted this superior performance by infants 
as being due to poor top-down stimulation by pathways 
from frontal areas. Only at 7 months old were these 
pathways sufficiently mature to produce object mask-
ing. This is consistent with the ages in studies of theta-
error detection, reviewed above, at which infants detect 
errors in perceptual displays, suggesting that these 
same top-down pathways could convey error informa-
tion to influence perception. However, Nakashima et al.’s 
study suggests that these brain pathways might not yet 
be developed in 3-month-old infants. It seems likely 
that the influence of frontal areas of sensory systems 
may continue to increase well beyond infancy. In addi-
tion to the age limits, Nakashima et al.’s study suggests 
that prediction error is not the only basis for preference. 
When the researchers mixed faces and blanks, the older 
infants looked longer at faces, not because they pre-
dicted blanks and the faces deviated from prediction, 
but probably because faces are an especially preferred 
type of stimuli. Although at this point there is not much 
research in this direction, and therefore the conclusion 
should be considered with caution, Nakashima et al.’s 
findings raise the question of how early in infancy the 
connections between the different relevant areas of the

brain develop, providing the infrastructure for predic-
tive processes to occur. Feedforward predictions and 
prediction errors requiring connections between the 
ACC and sensory brain areas might be possible already 
at 6 to 7 months of age. Interesting supporting evidence 
in this respect has been found using the functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy technology. In a study by 
Emberson et al. (2015) with 6-month-old infants, the 
question of whether expectations about future sensory 
input can modulate brain activity in the infant visual 
cortex was tested using a cross-modal (audiovisual) 
omission paradigm. An expectation-based increase was 
found in the hemodynamic responses at the occipital 
cortex (when the auditory stimulus predicted the 
appearance of a visual one). Moreover, there was no 
such response in the visual cortex to auditory stimuli 
that were not predictive of a visual event. This pattern 
of results was interpreted as suggestive that “the young 
infant’s brain is already capable of some rudimentary 
form of expectation-based feedback.” Still, further 
development and maturation of the control networks 
is probably necessary before prediction errors can be 
reflected in the actual behavior of the child. For exam-
ple, a purely behavioral study of the classical response 
slowing following an error in a Simple Simon game 
showed that it can be found in children 3 to 4 years 
old but not in younger toddlers (Jones et al., 2003).
Conclusions, Open Questions, and 
Future Research Directions
The extant empirical evidence reviewed above supports 
the idea that by at least 6 to 7 months of age, infants’ 
brain activity reflects surprise when predictions are vio-
lated in visual displays, which can be interpreted as 
prediction errors. Such neural responses involve theta-
frequency activity, probably arising from the brain frontal 
midline including the anterior cingulate, which has been 
associated with learning in infants and adults and with 
increased brain connectivity in mouse studies (Piscopo 
et al., 2018; Weible et al., 2017).
This modern conceptualization is certainly intriguing 
and exciting. Yet there are many open questions arising 
from the presented ideas and claims that should guide 
future empirical investigations. It is still to be seen 
whether prediction errors in different domains and con-
ditions all indeed involve one unified “control” mecha-
nism. Moreover, it is yet to be seen whether the power 
of theta brain activity in infants is proportional to the 
discrepancy of the presented information from the pre-
dicted information and whether the perception of this 
discrepancy similarly follows the rules of perception of 
stimuli, meaning a logarithmic function, similarly to 
what was found by Tzur et al. (2010) in adults. At this 
point, there is only one study in infants (7-month-olds) 
that is somewhat related to this question. In the area 
of numerosity discrimination, both theta-band (4–6 Hz) 
and alpha-band (6–8 Hz) oscillatory power was found 
to differentiate between novel and familiar numerosi-
ties. However, at least in this case, only the power in 
alpha, but not in theta, was sensitive to the numerical 
ratio between the numerosities (Libertus et al., 2009). 
A further issue, as was discussed above in the section 
about the development of the neural connectivity sup-
porting prediction errors, is the exact maturation timing 
of the brain pathways connecting the ACC and sensory 
areas that can support the flow of information required 
for the prediction processes. An intriguing opportunity 
that modern technology provides and that calls for seri-
ous research is the possibility to induce neuromodula-
tion from scalp electrodes by enhancing middle-frontal 
theta activity, which might be able to strengthen the 
ACC signaling of prediction errors and therefore influ-
ence learning. Imagine, for example, using such tech-
nology for compensating the missing prediction error 
that the ACC should have signaled in individuals with 
neurodevelopmental psychopathologies involving defi-
cits in this functioning, helping them to learn. Even 
theta stimulation too brief for white-matter change has 
been shown to produce behavioral change in attention 
(Reinhart & Nguyen, 2019) and memory (Roberts et al., 
2018). A possible mechanism for such change is the 
enhanced synaptic plasticity that can be induced when 
rapid synaptic stimulation is synchronized to theta 
activity (Larson & Munkácsy, 2015). The intriguing pos-
sible modulating effects of theta induction, described 
in human adults and rodents, is still in very initial 
stages. At this point, in adults, theta electrical stimula-
tion plus task training have enhanced behavioral per-
formance and increased intrinsic theta (Voelker et al., 
2020) but have failed to change structural white matter 
surrounding the ACC (Voelker et al., 2021) and have 
yet to be studied in infants and children.
