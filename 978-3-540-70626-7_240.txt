X-Rays
Bruce R. Wheaton
Modern physics began with the discovery of X-rays in 1896 by Wilhelm Conrad
R¨ontgen (1845–1923), an event well described. Less known is the important role
X-rays played in the earliest introduction of quantum concepts. Their early impulse
interpretation forced consideration in 1896 of quantity of impulses, unlike during
the prior century of thought about radiation. This set the stage for a sea change in
concepts of radiation.
Improvements in vacuum technology from the 1850s had led to cathode dis-
charge tubes and X-rays. These were an “entirely new form of radiation” that could
pass right though opaque matter. Many hypotheses emerged in explanation, the most
profound a resuscitation of Christiaan Huygens (1629–95) disconnected impulse
model of light, now from the pen of George Gabriel Stokes (1819–1903). Each col-
lision of a cathode-beam electron at the anode gives rise to a single such impulse
propagating away, only the vast number of impacts gives rise to the seeming contin-
uous ﬂow of the X-rays. They lack periodicity just as would be expected of white
light comprised of a continuum of frequencies.
Within 4 years Dutch physicists demonstrated diffraction of X-rays from a slit,
implying a wavelength of 1 ˚A (10−4 that of light), which seemed to argue against
the accepted impulse model. This challenged the young Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–
1951) in G¨ottingen, who in 1900 showed impulses could diffract but would show no
fringes. He concluded that a continuum of electromagnetic disturbances exists, from
periodic waves of light to aperiodic impulses of X-rays and the γ-rays discovered
that year by Paul Villard (1860–1934). By 1905 it was clear that X-rays propagate
with the speed of light.
X-rays passing through a gas release electrons in numbers and velocities easily
measured. But there seemed to be too few (quantity) and those had more energy
(quality) than was expected. Both paradoxes led many to the view that, unlike light,
X-rays do not spread their energy isotropically into the aether, but concentrate it in
speciﬁc directions. And the case for γ-rays was even stronger, so that several of their
investigators began to argue forcefully that γs are actual material particles.
In response, Charles Barkla’s (1877–1944) experiments on secondary X-rays
stimulated from elements by X-rays showed them to be polarized and have peri-
odic properties “characteristic” of the scattering material as one of two components;
the other an inhomogeneous X-ray component soon to be called the Bremsenanteil.
This led to lively controversy in the English literature between William Henry Bragg
(1862–1942) and Barkla, in the German between Johannes Stark (1874–1957) and
Sommerfeld about the physical nature of X-rays.

X-Rays
On the surface, all seemed resolved in favor of periodic waves when, in 1912,
X-rays directed through a crystal showed unmistakable interference effects. But the
new crystal metric simultaneously provided the most accurate yet indication that
X-rays transfer energy only in quantum units.
The next decade, largely in response to the successes of the  Bohr atom,
saw little consideration of the “nature” of X-rays except amongst experimental-
ists. Millikan was astonished in 1916 to corroborate Albert Einstein’s (1879–1955)
equation for the  photoelectric effect. Precise new techniques developed to mea-
sure β-particle  electrons from  radioactive decay law were applied to secondary
electrons released by X-rays and by γ-rays. The newly invented Coolidge X-ray tube
provided rays of unprecedented stability for precise tests. And in William Duane’s
(1872–1935) Harvard laboratory in 1918 his student came very close to corroborat-
ing Einstein’s photoeffect law for X-rays.
But in the periphery of physics in post-war Europe, these issues carried weight. In
particular, the interns in the private laboratory of Maurice de Broglie (1875–1960)
in Paris took “atoms of light” very seriously indeed. The X-ray photoeffect, now
amenable to precise quantitative study with the β-ray spectrometer, became subject
of intense research by Alexandre Dauvillier (1892–1979). His results convinced
de Broglie that X-rays “must be corpuscular” or “energy must be concentrated in
points on the surface of the wave.” The elder de Broglie presented his ﬁndings at the
third Solvay Congress in Paris 1921, where (with corroborating γ -ray ﬁndings from
Charles Ellis (1895–1980)) they dominated discussion at the entire meeting.
It is well-known that Maurice’s younger brother Louis de Broglie (1892–1987)
turned this seeming paradox into his hypothesis of  matter waves in 1923. His
reconciliation of  wave-particle duality led directly to Erwin Schr¨odinger’s (1887–
1961)  wave mechanics, one of the two statements of the new  quantum
mechanics of 1926. Schr¨odinger’s arose from radiation theory, Werner Heisenberg’s
(1901–1976)  matrix mechanics from concerns with atomic theory; another corol-
lary of wave-particle duality.
