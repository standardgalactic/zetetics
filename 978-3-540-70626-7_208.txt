Stark Effect
This state exhibits strong correlations as for example a photon number measure-
ment in one mode determines the outcome of a photon number measurement in
the other mode. Two-mode squeezed states form the basic resource for  quan-
tum communication protocols such as quantum state teleportation. Various methods
for the generation of such states exist. A simple method consists of sending two
single mode squeezed states of the type described above onto the two inputs of a
beam-splitter making sure that one squeezed state exhibits squeezing along the x
quadrature while the other exhibits exactly the same degree of squeezing but along
the p quadrature. The output of the beam-splitter will then be a two-mode squeezed
state as in (3).
The distribution of two-mode squeezed states, and therefore entanglement, gen-
erally suffers from noise and the development of methods to combat the effects of
noise and to improve the squeezing and entanglement in such states is an active area
of research today [6,7].

Klaus Hentschel
In late 1913 Johannes Stark (1874–1957), the professor of experimental physics
at the technical university of Aachen who would later champion the Aryan
physics movement, discovered the effect of electric ﬁelds on spectral lines. This
