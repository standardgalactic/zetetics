Abstract
The discovery by JWST of an abundance of luminous galaxies in the very early
Universe suggests that galaxies developed rapidly, in apparent tension with many
standard models [1–5]. However, most of these galaxies lack spectroscopic con-
firmation, so their distances and properties are uncertain. We present JADES
JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopic confirmation of two luminous galaxies at redshifts
of z = 14.32+0.08
−0.20 and z = 13.90 ± 0.17. The spectra reveal ultraviolet
continua with prominent Lyman-α breaks but no detected emission lines. This
discovery proves that luminous galaxies were already in place 300 million years
after the Big Bang and are more common than what was expected before JWST.
The most distant of the two galaxies is unexpectedly luminous and is spatially
resolved with a radius of 260 parsecs. Considering also the steep ultraviolet slope
of the second galaxy, we conclude that both are dominated by stellar continuum
emission, showing that the excess of luminous galaxies in the early Universe can-
not be entirely explained by accretion onto black holes. Galaxy formation models
will need to address the existence of such large and luminous galaxies so early in
cosmic history.
We present deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec [6] spectroscopy
for three candidate galaxies at z > 14, selected within the JWST Advanced Deep
Extragalactic Survey (JADES) campaigns [7, 8]. These galaxies were photometrically
identified from within the 58 square arcminute observations of the GOODS-S field
through JWST observations with up to 13 NIRCam and 7 MIRI filters [4, 9, 10]. Based
on photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Cycle 1 JWST/NIR-
Cam data, the probability of these galaxies being low-redshift interlopers was less
than 1% [9]. By happenstance, the brightest of these three candidate galaxies (here-
after: JADES-GS-z14-0) is located at a projected distance of only 0.4 arcsec from a
foreground galaxy, and this interloper is at a redshift where its Balmer break is spec-
trally coincident with the observed photometric Lyman-α break of the distant galaxy.
For this reason, and due to its high inferred luminosity at the photometric redshift,
JADES-GS-z14-0 was previously considered a low-redshift interloper with a peculiar
spectral energy distribution [9, 10]. The “low-redshift solution” was later disfavored
from the analysis [4] of the JWST/NIRCam observations carried out in the JADES
Origins Field program [8], which included additional deep medium-band NIRCam
observations that substantially strengthened the case for the source being at high
redshift.
The three galaxies were observed with NIRSpec in multi-object spectroscopic mode
[11], within a single NIRSpec field of view of 9 square arcmin, with both the low-
resolution prism and all three medium-resolution gratings probing the wavelength
range 0.6−5.2 µm with spectral resolving powers R ∼100 and R ∼1000, respectively.
Owing to both the low luminosity of the source and NIRSpec slit losses, the faintest
candidate is not significantly detected in the NIRSpec observations (see Methods), so
hereon we focus on the other two galaxies, JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1,
which have been unambiguously detected in the prism spectra.

Figure 1 shows the prism spectra of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1; there
are no prominent emission lines, but both galaxies display a clear break in the flux
density, with no flux detected blueward of 1.85 µm; the sharpness of which (flux ratio
between 1.90 −2.1 µm and 1.5 −1.8 µm higher than 9) can only be explained as a
Lyman-α break [12, 13], placing both galaxies at z ∼14.
We have also obtained the spectrum of the low-redshift galaxy 0.4 arcsec East
of JADES-GS-z14-0, which has revealed multiple prominent emission lines (e.g.
[OIII]λλ4959,5007 and Hα) placing this projected nearby source at a redshift of
z = 3.475 (see Methods). At this redshift, its Balmer break is at 1.62 µm, excluding
the possibility that the sharp break in the flux density at 1.85 µm observed in the
spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0 is caused by contamination from the nearby foreground
source. The presence of the nearby low-redshift galaxy, however, mildly boosts the
luminosity of JADES-GS-z14-0 via gravitational lensing. We have verified that the
magnification factor is less than a factor of 1.2 (see Methods).
A redshift determination for galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization based solely
on the Lyman-α break is sensitive to the absorption of neutral hydrogen along the
line of sight [12, 14, 15]. Recent studies have shown that the profile of the Lyα spec-
tral break does not depend only on intergalactic medium absorption but can also be
modulated by: a) neutral gas in the galaxy or in the surrounding medium [14, 16, 17];
b) the presence of a local ionized bubble [18, 19]; c) Lyα line emission which would
enhance the flux of spectral channels containing the line in the low-resolution data
[20]. We have thus estimated the redshift of the two galaxies by parameterizing the
rest-frame UV continuum emission with a power law of the form Fλ ∝λβ and taking
into account the multiple physical processes that can shape the Lyman break pro-
file in the prism spectra (see Methods). The redshifts we have recovered from our
best-fitting models are z = 14.32+0.08
−0.20 and z = 13.90 ± 0.17 for JADES-GS-z14-0 and
JADES-GS-z14-1, respectively.
In the redshift range inferred by fitting the Lyman break profile, we have also found
a tentative detection of CIII]λλ1907, 1909 (hereafter: CIII]) emission at 2.89 µm in
JADES-GS-z14-0 (see Methods) at a level of significance of 3.6σ. If confirmed in future
NIRSpec observations, this line yields a redshift of 14.178 ± 0.013 and the presence
of damped Lyman-α absorption (DLA) with a neutral hydrogen column density of
log10(NHI/cm−2) = 22.23 ± 0.08 is necessary to match the wavelength and shape of
the Lyman-α break. Similarly dense DLAs have already been observed in other z > 10
galaxies, and their existence is not surprising given the neutral gas reservoirs in the
early Universe [14–17].
These are the earliest galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts, exceed-
ing the previous high marks of z = 13.2 [12, 15] and z = 13.07 [13]. Additionally, these
two galaxies are luminous with a rest-frame UV absolute luminosity at 1500 ˚A of
MUV = −20.81 and MUV = −19.00, respectively. We particularly highlight JADES-
GS-z14-0, which despite its redshift is the third most UV luminous of the 700 z > 8
candidates in JADES, two times more luminous than GHZ2 [21, 22], and only a fac-
tor of two less luminous than GN-z11 [23, 24]. We illustrate the distribution of UV
luminosity and redshift in Fig. 2. We stress that the high luminosity is particularly

important in view of the rapidly evolving halo mass function expected in cold-dark-
matter cosmology. From a N-body simulation run with Abacus [25], we estimate
that the halo mass threshold required to yield a fixed comoving abundance varies
as (1 + z)−6 for this region of mass and redshift. A dimensional scaling for lumi-
nosity would be halo mass divided by the age of the Universe, which is scaling as
(1 + z)−3/2, yielding a simple baseline that luminosities might scale as (1 + z)−4.5.
Overplotting such a scaling on Fig. 2 shows how remarkable JADES-GS-z14-0 is: it
shows most dramatically that some astrophysical processes are creating a deviation
from the dimensional scaling of halo mass and the Hubble time. Even JADES-GS-z14-
1, while more similar in MUV to the lower redshift family, is distinctively luminous by
this metric. We, therefore, argue that these two galaxies, and particularly JADES-GS-
z14-0, provide a crisp spectroscopic confirmation to the trend that has been inferred
several times from photometric samples [1, 3–5] that the galaxy UV luminosity func-
tion evolves slowly, with more luminous galaxies at high redshift than predicted in
a variety of pre-JWST predictions. Having established the remarkable redshifts and
luminosities of these sources, we now turn to a more detailed analysis of them.
From the spectrum redward of the break, we measure a power-law index β, also
known as the UV slope, of −2.20 ± 0.07 and −2.71 ± 0.19 for JADES-GS-z14-0 and
JADES-GS-z14-1, respectively. These results indicate that the emission is dominated
by a relatively young (< 300 Myr) stellar population and low dust attenuation [26–
28]. We note that the the stellar UV slope could be also modified by two-photon and
free-bound nebular continuum emission [26–29]. However, we can rule out a strong
two-photon contribution in our galaxies due to the lack of the characteristic peak
at 1500 ˚A [29]. The absence of emission lines disfavors free-bound emission, but this
possibility cannot be fully ruled out because, at z ∼14, NIRSpec does not cover the
Balmer break nor any Balmer emission lines.
Both the upper limits on the emission lines and the tentative detection of CIII]
in JADES-GS-z14-0, with a rest-frame equivalent width EW0 = 8.0 ± 2.3 ˚A, are
consistent with those observed in lower-luminosity galaxies at z > 10 [12, 15]. On
the other hand, if we compare JADES-GS-z14-0 with the most luminous galaxies at
z > 10, such as GN-z11 [30] and GHZ2 [21], we would expect to detect both CIII]
and CIVλλ1548, 1551 in the prism spectra of our galaxies. This spectral difference
may be due to an extremely low metallicity (Z < 0.05 Z⊙) or a large escape fraction
of ionizing photons which reduces the emission by the gas in the interstellar medium
[12, 15] or a different nature of the dominant ionizing flux [31].
The physical properties of the two galaxies have been inferred via spectro-
photometric modeling of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) within a Bayesian
framework. The details of the modeling and the posterior distribution of free parame-
ters are discussed in the Methods section, while the galaxy properties are reported in
Table 1. The inferred star-formation history indicates that these galaxies have grown
their masses over the last 100 Myr, implying that the observed stellar population
started forming at z ∼20 with a rapid growth up to z ∼14 [32]. We also note that
the SED modeling favors a high escape fraction of ionizing photons (fLyC
esc
> 0.35) to
reproduce the blue UV slopes and the absence of emission lines in both galaxies.

relatively low number of galaxies near z = 10 is an artifact of photometric-redshift selections. Dashed

The NIRCam images of JADES-GS-z14-0 clearly show that the source is extended,
while JADES-GS-z14-1 is more compact. Fig. 3 shows the radial profile of the emission
at 2 µm of the two galaxies. The radial surface brightness profile of JADES-GS-z14-0
exhibits emission extended up to 1 kpc, significantly beyond the point spread function
of JWST. We also note that the profile is significantly more extended than the UV
emission of the two more luminous galaxies at z > 10: GN-z11 [24, 31] and GHZ2
[21, 22]. Using ForcePho (see Methods) to fit the imaging, we find that the galaxy is
well fit by an elliptical exponential profile with a deconvolved half-light radius (rUV)
of 0.0788 ± 0.006 arcsec and 260 ± 20 pc. This large size implies that the UV light
of JADES-GS-z14-0 is produced mainly by a spatially extended stellar population,
excluding a dominant contribution by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). This differs
from other more compact high-luminosity galaxies, where some studies have suggested
that an unobscured AGN is dominating the UV light [31, 35].
The rest-frame UV emission of JADES-GS-z14-1 appears compact and marginally
resolved by the NIRCam point-spread function. The forward modeling of the light
profile returns an upper limit on rUV < 160 pc, which agrees with the compact size
determined for other low-luminosity z > 10 galaxies [4, 15, 36]. For this galaxy, the
morphological analysis is not sufficient to exclude the presence of a luminous AGN,
but the inferred UV slope of –2.71 suggests that the light is mainly emitted by stars
in the galaxy. The slope expected for the emission of an AGN accretion disk is, on
average, of the order of –2.3 or shallower [37, 38], and there are no mechanisms that
are able to reproduce a steeper profile without invoking a strong contribution from
the emission of a young (< 50 Myr) stellar population [26–28].
The best-fitting SED models presented in Table 1 indicate a modest but non-
zero amount of reddening by dust, with an AV of 0.2–0.3 mag for both galaxies.
These results are in agreement with recent models proposed to explain the presence
of luminous galaxies such as JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 at early times
[40, 41]. Such models expect that z > 10 galaxies have lower dust content in the
interstellar medium than equal-mass galaxies at lower redshifts, despite the rapid
(∼10 Myr) dust enrichment from supernovae [42]. Indeed, if our massive z ∼14
galaxies had a stellar-to-dust ratio of about 0.002, similar to those observed in z ∼6
galaxies [43], the dust attenuation would be a factor at least 4 times higher (AV >
1 mag), due to their compact UV size, than what is observed [40]. The moderate dust
attenuation in our galaxies can be explained by different scenarios: 1) a large amount
of dust distributed on large scales due to galactic outflows, reducing the observed dust
attenuation [40, 44]; 2) a different dust composition [45] and so dust mass absorption
coefficient; 3) a high destruction rate of pre-existing dust grains due to shock waves
generated by supernovae explosions [42]. Independently from the proposed scenarios,
our observations indicate that the properties of galaxies appear to change rapidly in
only 600 Myr (i.e. from z = 14 to z = 6).
In conclusion, the presented spectroscopic observations of JADES-GS-z14-0 and
JADES-GS-z14-1 confirm that bright and massive galaxies existed already only 300
Myr after the Big Bang, and their number density [4] is more than ten times higher
than extrapolations based on pre-JWST observations [46]. The morphology and UV
slope analysis help rule out a significant AGN contribution for either galaxy. Other

curve), GNz11 [39] (orange squares) and GHZ2 [21] (green diamonds) shows that JADES-GS-z14-0
is significantly more extended than the most luminous galaxies previously known at z > 10.
potential explanations, such as dust content [40], star-formation processes [5, 47], and
a top-heavy initial mass function [48, 49], must be investigated to explain the excess
of luminous galaxies in the early Universe.
In the context of future observations, we stress that JADES-GS-z14-0 is unexpect-
edly and remarkably luminous. The spectroscopic confirmation of this source implies
the existence of many similar galaxies – particularly when considering the relatively
small survey area of JADES. Galaxies like this are sufficiently luminous for follow-up
observations with ALMA and MIRI, promising to open the view to the rest-frame
optical and far-infrared at Cosmic Dawn, the period where the first galaxies were born.

Cosmology model and definitions
Throughout this study, we adopt the following cosmological parameters: H0 = 70 km
s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7. 1 arcsec at z = 14 corresponds to a physical
scale of 3.268 kpc. All magnitudes are presented in the AB systems, and the term
SFR10Myr refers to the star formation rate averaged over the past 10 Myr. Equivalent
widths of emission lines are quoted in the rest-frame. The absolute UV magnitude is
estimated at the rest-frame wavelength of 1500 ˚A.
NIRSpec observations and data reduction
The NIRSpec data used in this work are part of the Guaranteed Time Observations
program ID 1287. The observations were carried out between January 10 and 12,
2024. Three consecutive visits were scheduled for the program, but the visit 2 was not
performed because of a loss of lock on the guide star.
The two obtained visits, 1 and 3, differed in their pointing by < 1 arcsec and
adopted different microshutter array (MSA) configurations. JADES-GS-z14-1 was
observed in both visits, while JADES-GS-z14-0 was observed only in the visit 1, as the
visit 3 was set up to observe the nearby low-redshift galaxy to exclude contamination.
The disperser-filter configurations employed in the program were PRISM/CLEAR,
G140M/F070LP, G235M/F170LP, G395M/F290LP and G395H/F290LP. The first
four spectral configurations provided spectroscopic data with spectral resolving power
of R = ∆λ/λ ∼100 and R ∼1000 in the wavelength range between 0.6 µm and
5.2 µm. The G395H/F290LP disperser-filter configuration covered the wavelength
range 2.87–5.27 µm with spectral resolving power of R ∼2700.
For the PRISM/CLEAR configuration, four sequences of three nodded exposures
were used for each pointing, while one sequence of three nodded exposures was used for
the spectral configuration of the gratings. Each nodded exposure sequence consisted of
six integrations of 19 groups in NRSIRS2 readout mode[50], resulting in an exposure
time of 8403.2 seconds. The total exposure times for each target are reported in
Table 2.
We made use of the NIRSpec GTO pipeline (Carniani et al. in prep.) to process
the data. The pipeline was developed by the ESA NIRSpec Science Operations Team
and the NIRSpec GTO Team. A general overview of the data processing is reported
in [24] and [34]. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of the data, we used the 1D
spectra extracted from an aperture of 3 pixels, corresponding to 0.3 arcsec, located
at the target position in the 2D spectra.

Fig. 4 NIRSpec slit-losses. Slit-losses as a function of wavelength estimated by comparing the
NIRSpec continuum level and NIRCam fluxes. The first-order polynomial best fits and uncertainties
are reported as black lines and gray-shaded regions.
The pipeline applies a wavelength-dependent slit-loss correction to the measured
flux, based on the position of the source inside the micro-shutter and assuming a point-
source geometry. To verify the quality of this correction, we compare the pipeline-
corrected fluxes to the NIRCam photometric measurements. For JADES-GS-z14-0,
which is patially extended, we used the NIRCam measurements derived with ForcePho
(See Sec. Imaging data, Fig. 4). We found that ∼30% (∼50%) of the total flux is
lost at 2(5) µm in the NIRSpec data. We employed a first-order polynomial α1 + α0λ
to fit the slit losses as a function of wavelength (λ) and found α0 = 0.18 ± 0.11 µm−1,
α1 = 1 ± 0.2.
For JADES-GS-z14-1, the NIRCam fluxes inferred from an aperture of 0.2 arcsec
are consistent with the NIRSpec spectrum, indicating that the slit-loss correction
applied by the GTO pipeline is sufficient to recover the total light of this compact
source. In this case we estimated α0 = 0.001 ± 0.025 µm−1, α1 = 0.98 ± 0.12.
Imaging data
Photometry for the three candidate z ∼14 galaxies studied in this work was taken
from JWST/NIRCam imaging catalogs of JADES [7], with supplemental imaging data
from the First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopic COmplete Survey (FRESCO; [51])
and JADES Origins Field (JOF; [52]) programs. These data were reduced together
following the procedure outlined in ref. [8]. The resulting mosaics include both obser-
vations taken in late 2022 as well as additional JADES observations taken in late 2023,
and reach 5σ observational depths of 2.4 nJy in F200W using a 0.2′′ diameter aperture.
We present NIRCam thumbnails centered on JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1
in the top panels of Fig. 1.
The sources were initially selected from the modelling of the photometry presented
in [9]. Two of the sources we explore, JADES-GS-z14-1 (JADES-GS-53.07427-27.88592
in [9]), and the faintest galaxy described herein (JADES-GS-53.10763-27.86014) were
part of the primary sample of z > 8 galaxies in [9], with photometric redshifts

of zphot = 14.36 and zphot = 14.44, respectively. JADES-GS-z14-0 (JADES-GS-
53.08294-27.85563) was presented in [9] (at zphot = 14.51) but initially rejected in
that study due to the morphology, brightness, and the proximity of the source to the
neighboring galaxy with photometric evidence of a Balmer break at ∼1.7µm.
In October 2023, JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-53.10763-27.86014 were also
observed as part of the JOF program, which included a NIRCam pointing of 104 hours
of total exposure spread between six medium-band filters (F162M, F182M, F210M,
F250M, F300M, F335M). These filters were chosen to help refine high-redshift galaxy
selection in this ultra-deep region of the JADES footprint. NIRCam medium bands
can be used to trace the galaxy stellar continuum and aid in rejecting sources at low
redshift with strong emission lines that have similar wide-filter colors to high-redshift
galaxies [53–55]. In Robertson et al. [4], the authors used JOF photometry to select
a sample of nine candidate galaxies at z = 11.5 −15, including JADES-GS-z14-0.
The additional medium-band observations for this source had a best-fit photometric
redshift of zphot = 14.4, and fits at z < 7 were effectively ruled out because of the lack
of flux observed shortward of the Lyman-α break, the strength of the break implied
by the F182M – F210M color, and the F250M flux tracing the UV continuum. The
authors also estimated a UV slope of −2.40 ± 0.12 and a size of 260 ± 6 pc, which
are consistent with those inferred in this study. Robertson et al. [4] also presented the
evolution of the UV luminosity function and cosmic star formation rate density at
z > 14 inferred from observations of JADES-GS-z14-0, and we refer the reader there
for more details.
For the present analysis, we fit JADES-GS-z14-0 using ForcePho (Johnson B.
et al., in prep.) in order to properly disentangle the flux of this source from the
neighbor. For JADES-GS-z14-1, as this source was isolated and much more compact,
we extracted fluxes using aperture photometry with an 0.2′′ aperture, and applied an
aperture correction assuming a point source. In a companion paper [32], our team

third candidate z ∼14 galaxy observed with NIRSpec in the observing program 1287. Due to the
low signal-to-noise ratio, no redshift can be inferred from this spectrum. The top row shows cutouts

presents JWST/MIRI photometry of JADES-GS-z14-0 from ultra-deep 43 hr F770W
imaging from Program ID 1180. This measures F770W to be 74±5 nJy, mildly above
the 3–5 µm photometry of ∼47 nJy, likely due to the presence of strong emission lines
in F770W. Helton et al. [32] discusses the implications of this rest-optical finding.
The third candidate JADES-GS-53.10763-27.86014
Fig. 5 shows the 1D and 2D spectra of the candidate z ∼14 galaxy JADES-GS-
53.10763-27.86014 identified by [9] and [4]. The NIRCam images display a clear
dropout in bluer filters, yielding a photometric redshift of 14.6. Only a faint contin-
uum emission is barely detected in the NIRSpec spectrum with a significance level less
than 1σ. The signal is not sufficient to confirm or rule out the photometric redshift
determined by NIRCam images. We believe that the NIRSpec slit-losses contribute
to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data. The target is located at the edge of the
shutter, and, despite its compact size, we expect that about 20% of the light is lost
at 2 µm and 35% at 5 µm. The slit losses are two times higher than those of JADES-
GS-z14-1, which is also 1.6 times more luminous than JADES-GS-53.10763-27.86014.
In conclusion, the low sensitivity of these observations does not allow us to confirm
or rule out the photometric redshift for this target.
The low-redshift galaxy close to JADES-GS-z14-0
The identification of the neighboring galaxy with NIRCam ID 183349 at 0.4 arcsec
from JADES-GS-z14-0 initially raised several doubts about the photometric redshift
of the high-redshift target as the potential Lyman-α break for this object could be

Fig. 6 Low-redshift neighboring galaxy. The left panel shows the spectra of JADES-GS-z14-0
(blue) and of the target 183349 (orange). This latter is within 0.4 arcsec from JADES-GS-z14-0, as
shown in the NIRCam F277W cutout in the right panel. The MSA slitlets used for the two targets
are overplotted in blue and orange, respectively.
a Balmer break if these two sources are associated at similar redshifts. Therefore we
dedicated the visit 3 of the NIRSpec program 1287 to observe the neighboring galaxy
and assess any possible contamination and constrain the gravitational lensing effect.
Figure 6 shows the spectrum of the target 183349. The doublet [OIII]λλ4959, 5007
and Hα emission lines are detected with a high level of significance in both prism
and grating spectra, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of z = 3.475 (in agree-
ment with the photometric redshift za = 3.4 from Hainline et al. [9]). The spectrum
also reveals a clear Balmer break feature at ∼1.6 µm. Therefore, we can rule out the
drop at ∼1.9 µm observed in JADES-GS-z14-0 being due to the contamination of
the neighboring galaxy. Finally, 183349 has no bright emission lines at observed wave-
lengths at 2.89 µm, where we detect tentative CIII] emission in JADES-GS-z14-0. We
can thus rule out that the tentative CIII] is due to contamination from 183349.
As the foreground galaxy might contaminate the spectrum of the JADES-GS-z14-
0, we analyze the surface brightness profile of the two galaxies. Figure 7 shows the light
profiles from the F150W and F200W NIRCam images extracted from a slit-oriented
East-West and as large as 0.15 arcsec so that the slit includes both galaxies. JADES-
GS-z14-0 is absent in the F150W NIRCam image, and thus, we used the F150W profile
to quantify the contamination. Before the extraction, F150W NIRCam was smoothed
to the same angular resolution of F200W data. Figure 7 reports the light profiles in
the two filters normalized to the peak at the location of the foreground source (i.e.,
∼0.4 arcsec from the JADES-GS-z14-0). Assuming that the surface brightness profile
of the foreground galaxy in the F200W image is similar to that at F150W wavelengths,
we estimated a contamination of less than 10% at the location of JADES-GS-z14-0.
The last panel of Fig. 7 indeed illustrates the ratio between the light profile in F200W
filter and that in F150W from –0.2 arcsec (i.e., –0.6255 kpc) to 0.0 arcsec with respect
to the center of JADES-GS-z14-0. This spatial range corresponds to the region in
which the light of the two galaxies might overlap. The contamination is of the order
of 70% at 650 pc from the center of JADES-GS-z14-0 and drops rapidly to less than
20% at 350 parsecs from the galaxy. As the top-left edge of the NIRSpec shutter
is located at –0.08 arcsec from the center of JADES-GS-z14-0, we concluded that

the F150W and F200W NIRCam images of JADES-GS-z14-0. The NIRSpec micro-shutter slits of
visit 1 and 3 are illustrated in orange and blue, respectively. F150W images is smoothed to the same
angular resolution as F200W NIRCam image. The green and red lines shows the box-car extraction
regions from which we obtained the light profiles reported with the same colors in the third panel.
The profiles are normalized to the peak of the foreground galaxy. The last panel illustrates the ratio
between the F200W and F150W light profiles in the region where the two galaxies spatially overlap.
This ratio quantifies the contamination of the foreground galaxy to JADES-GS-z14-0. Vertical blue
dashed line shows the projection of the NIRSpec micro-shutter slit into the radial profile.
the contamination of the light of the foreground galaxy is negligible in the NIRSpec
spectrum. Therefore, the contamination of the low-z galaxy on the NIRSpec spectrum
is lower than 10%.
We have also verified that the magnification provided by the foreground galaxies
to JADES-GS-z14-0 is limited (µ < 1.2). We use the software lenstool [56] to con-
struct lens model of ID 183349 and another galaxy, JADES-GS-53.08324-27.85619 (ID
182698; zphot ∼2.04) that is 2.2 arcsec from JADES-GS-z14-0. Based on HST/ACS
and JWST/NIRCam SED, we infer stellar mass log(Mstar/M⊙) = 8.7 ± 0.1 and
9.7 ± 0.1 for ID 183349 and 182698, respectively. We then derived integrated veloc-
ity dispersions of 53 and 100 km s−1 assuming the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher Relation
measured at z ∼2.3 [57]. Assuming a singular isothermal spherical distribution of
matter in these two foreground potentials, we derive a modest lensing magnification
factor of µ = 1.17 at the location of JADES-GS-z14-0. Such a magnification factor is
corrected for when we derived the physical properties, e.g., luminosities and masses.

Redshift determination
The photometric redshifts of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 are za = 14.39
[4] and za = 14.36 [9], respectively . The strong Lyman breaks observed by NIRSpec in
both JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 confirm both galaxies to be at a redshift
of about ∼14. To determine the spectroscopic redshift, we model the continuum
emission with a power-law function (fλ ∝λβ), which well reproduces the rest-frame
UV continuum emission in galaxies with young stellar populations [26–28, 58], and
absorption of neutral hydrogen following the prescriptions discussed in Witstok et al.
(2024)[19] and Hainline et al. (2024) [15]. The IGM transmission is modeled following
Mason & Gronke (2020)[59] and depends on two free parameters: the global neutral
gas fraction (xHI) and the ionized bubble size (Rion). We assumed a flat prior for the
neutral gas fraction over the range xHI ∈[0.95, 1] and a flat prior distribution for the
ionized bubble size over the range Rion ∈[0.1, 1] proper Mpc. These are the expected
values for a typical galaxy with a MUV ∼−20 at z = 14 [60]. As the Lyman-α drop
profile can also be caused by dense neutral gas in the circumgalactic medium and
located along the line of sight (i.e., damped Lyman-α absorption) following [14] and
[15], we parametrized this additional absorption by the column density of neutral
hydrogen, log(NHI/cm−2) and assumed a flat prior log(NHI/cm−2) ∈[10, 28]. Finally,
recent studies [20, 61] have also shown that the Lyα emission line can modify the
prism spectra and so alter the redshift measurement. Therefore we added a mock
spectroscopically unresolved emission line in our model to represent the Lyα emission.
The line model was parametrized by the rest-frame equivalent width (log(EW0/˚A) ∈
[−2, 2]) and velocity shift with respect to systemic (∆v ∈[0, 3000] km s−1). This latter
mimics the effects of outflows and resonant scattering on Lyα line emission [62].
Figure 8 shows the posterior distributions of the free parameters used to fit the
data of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1. The posteriors of the parameters
xHI, Rion, and ∆v are flat for both galaxies and are not reported in the corner plot.
The best-fit redshifts are 14.32+0.08
−0.20 and 13.90±0.17, respectively for the two targets.
The profile of the posterior distributions of log(NHI/cm−2) exclude the presence of
dense DLA with log(NHI/cm−2) > 23.64, but does not preclude less dense absorbing
systems along the line of sight. The results also indicate that the rest-frame equivalent
width of the Lyman-α line is lower than 10 ˚A.
Emission lines
We inspected the prism and grating 1D and 2D spectra to identify any rest-frame
ultraviolet emission lines above the level of the noise in both targets. We estimated
emission line fluxes and equivalent widths from the continuum-subtracted spectra
over five spectral channels. The uncertainties on line fluxes and equivalent width were
determined by repeating the measurements on a sample of 2000 spectra obtained
by combining the spectra of the individual integrations with a bootstrap resampling
technique.
Given the uncertainties on the redshift based only on the Lyman-break, we esti-
mated the statistical significance of a set of emission lines (see Table 4) at different

redshifts. In particular we inferred the one-sided p-value for each line at different red-
shifts. We then determined the combined p-value of the set of lines by using Fisher’s
method and used it to quantify the statistical significance of the spectroscopic redshifts
(see details in [15]).
In the prism spectrum for JADES-GS-z14-0, we identified only a potential
CIII](λλ1907, 1909) emission line at z = 14.178 with a level of significance of 3.6σ and
the combined p-value for the inferred redshift is 0.00363. The redshift is consistent
within the error with that determined from the fitting of the Lyman-break profile, but

follow-up observations are fundamental to confirm the emission line. We note that the
presence of only carbon line in the rest-frame UV spectrum is consistent with other
low redshift studies concluding that CIII] might be the strongest rest-UV line after
the Lyα line [63, 64].
The rest-frame equivalent width of the line is 8.01 ± 2.27 ˚A (Table 4) that is
below the redshift-EW(CIII]) relation inferred by [65] for the general distant galaxy
population and expected to be ∼20 ˚A at z = 14. The estimated EW(CIII]) for JADES-
GS-z14-0 is 2-3 times lower than what was observed in GS-z12-0 [14] and GHZ2 [21].
In the grating we did not find any lines and the 3σ upper limits, which were estimated
by using the bootstrap resampling technique, are reported Table 4.
In both the prism and grating of JADES-GS-z14-1 we did not find any clear
emission line feature with a level of significance higher than 3σ. We identified only
the potential lines of CIII]λ1909 and MgIIλ2795 at z = 14.063 with a signal-to-noise
ratio of about 2. The combined p-value for this redshift is 0.01249, suggesting that
this solution is not statistically significant. We thus derived the upper limits on the
emission lines and equivalent widths from both prism and grating spectra (Table 4).
The prism spectra also reveals an absorption feature at 2µ but its significance is only
2σ. If it will be confirmed in future observations, it corresponds to CII λ1335 doublet
absorption line.

Possible large-scale structure association
JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 are 1.9′ apart on the sky (Fig. 11), which is
6.2 comoving Mpc at this redshift. The third candidate completes a roughly equilat-
eral triangle, 1.7′ and 2.7′ away from the first two, respectively. These three galaxies
form a mild angular over-abundance of the candidates from [9], a fact that influenced
the selection of this location for the program 1287 deep NIRSpec pointing. The sep-
aration along the line of sight is imprecisely known, given the redshift uncertainties.
If JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 are separated by 0.42 in redshift, then this
would be about 60 comoving Mpc along the line of sight. However, the galaxies could
be substantially closer, even potentially at the same redshift, if more unusual combi-
nations of neutral hydrogen absorption and Lyα emission were present. Narrow-line
redshifts will be needed to measure this. As galaxies at high redshift are expected to
exhibit a high clustering bias [e.g., 66, 67], supported by numerous findings of inho-
mogeneity at z ≈7 [e.g., 68, 69], it seems likely that these galaxies are at least mildly
associated in an extended large-scale structure.

SED fitting
We fit JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1 following a similar approach to that
of Hainline et al. [15] [see also 12]. In summary, we use the BEAGLE tool [BayEsian
Analysis of GaLaxy sEds 70] to fit the combined R100 NIRSpec spectra and NIRCam
+ MIRI photometry. We fit the entire spectrum uncorrected for slit losses and mask
the rest-frame region 1150 – 1450 ˚A to avoid biases arising from the Lyαdamping
wing, which we do not model in BEAGLE. We fit the NIRCam wide-bands F090W,
F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W, and the MIRI F770W band, using
the values and errors reported in Table 3. We adopt Gaussian priors for the redshift
of the sources, centered on z = 14.32 and with σz = 0.2 for JADES-GS-z14-0, and
centered on z = 13.9 and with σz = 0.17 for JADES-GS-z14-1. To account for the
wavelength-dependent slit-losses of NIRSpec, which are especially important for the
extended object JADES-GS-z14-0, we include in the fitting a second-order polynomial,
which is applied to the model spectrum before comparing it with the observed one.
This enables the model to reproduce consistently the NIRCam+MIRI photometry and
uncorrected NIRSpec spectrum. The inset in Figure 12, and in particular the difference
between the grey (model before the polynomial correction) and blue lines (model with
the applied correction), shows the importance of this correction for JADES-GS-z14-
0. We do not use the first-order polynomial correction estimated in Sec. NIRSpec
observations because we want to take into account the uncertainties associated with
slit-losses correction directly in the Bayesian SED fitting.
As in Hainline et al. [15], we use an updated version of the Bruzual and Charlot
[71] stellar population synthesis models [see 72, for details], along with the photoion-
ization models of Gutkin et al. [73]. We assume a Chabrier [74] initial mass function
(IMF) with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 300 M⊙, respectively. We fit three
different models, in which we vary assumptions on the star formation history and
escape fraction of ionizing photons. Similarly to Hainline et al. [15], we find that the
blue UV slopes of our objects and the absence of (securely) detected emission lines,
can be explained by (i) a star formation rate which suddenly drops to very low val-
ues during the last 10 Myr of star formation, but with most stars being a few tens
of Myr old, as they can produce blue UV slopes. This scenario implies an unlikely
fine-tuning of the star formation history of these galaxies. (ii) A metal-enriched gas
(near-to-Solar metallicity), as such a large metallicity would also suppress the high-
ionization UV lines (but also produce redder UV slopes). (iii) A large escape fraction
of ionizing photons. This latter model is our fiducial one, since, as we extensively dis-
cussed in Hainline et al. [15], is the only model that can simultaneously reproduce the
observed blue UV slopes and the absence of UV emission lines.
Our fiducial model is thus described by seven adjustable parameters: the total
stellar mass formed Mtot, age of the oldest stars t, stellar metallicity Z∗, gas ionization
parameter log US, V-band dust attenuation optical depth ˆτV (i.e., AV /1.086), escape
fraction of ionizing photons fesc and redshift z. We assume the Charlot and Fall [75]
two-component dust attenuation model, fixing the fraction of attenuation arising from
stellar birth clouds to µ = 0.4. We further fix the metal’s depletion factor to ξ = 0.1.
Note that in our model the stellar metallicity Z∗and interstellar metallicity Zism are
equal, while the gas abundance of a metal further depends on the metal depletion.

Fig. 12 Beagle-based SED modeling of JADES-GS-z14-0. Posterior probability distributions
obtained with Beagle for our fiducial fits, along with the observed spectrum and model prediction,
for JADES-GS-z14-0. From left to right, the columns show the stellar mass M∗, star formation rate,
age of the oldest stars t, (stellar and interstellar) metallicity Z, V-band attenuation optical depth ˆτV ,
ionization parameter log US, and escape fraction of ionizing photons fesc. The 1D (marginal) posterior
distribution of each parameter is plotted along the diagonal, where the shaded gray regions represent
the 1σ credible interval. The off-diagonal panels show the 2D (joint) posterior distributions, with the
shaded blue regions representing the 1, 2, and 3σ credible intervals. In the top right panel of the inset,
we show the observed spectrum (red line), model predictions (dark blue line), and model predictions
before applying instrumental effects (i.e. line-spread function and calibration polynomial, grey line).
The model predictions at λ < 1450 ˚A are shown with a cyan line, to indicate that this region was
masked during the fitting. In the central panel of the inset, we show the residuals in units of observed
errors and the ±1σ region in grey, while the bottom panel indicates the calibration polynomial.

Fig. 13 Beagle-based SED modeling of JADES-GS-z14-1. Same as in Figure 12, but for
JADES-GS-z14-1.
From Beagle-based SED modeling we find that the JADES-GS-z14-0 has a stel-
lar mass of log10(Mstar/M⊙) = 8.7+0.7
−0.2 and a star-formation rate, averaged over the
last 10 Myr, of SFR10 = 22 ± 6 M⊙yr−1, resulting in a specific SFR of sSFR =
SFR/Mstar = 45 Gyr−1. We estimate a gas-phase metallicity of log (Z/Z⊙) = −1.5+0.7
−0.4
and a dust attenuation of AV ∼0.3 mag assuming a standard nebular continuum pow-
ered by OB stars. JADES-GS-z14-1 is less massive, with log10(Mstar/M⊙) = 8.0+0.4
−0.3
and a star-formation rate of SFR10 = 2.0+0.7
−0.4 M⊙yr−1. We infer a sSFR of about
18 Gyr−1. For this galaxy, we estimate a metallicity of log(Z/Z⊙) = −1.1+0.6
−0.6 and a
dust attenuation of AV ∼0.2 mag. We remind that the errors quoted here refer only
to the internal statistical errors of our model with the above assumptions. Notably,
23

the inference of stellar mass is known to be sensitive to assumptions, with variations of
about 0.2 dex depending on the SED fitting code and star-formation histories allowed
in the model [32]. More exotic deviations in astrophysics, such as variations in the
stellar IMF [76], could create further differences.
Morphological analysis
To determine the extension of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, we initially
extracted the radial surface brightness profile from the NIRCam F277W images, which
are are a compromise between S/N and angular resolution for these galaxies.
We have determined the average surface brightness from concentric radial annuli
centered at the position of the target and radius width of 0.03′′. For JADES-GS-z14-
0 we have masked the image at Right Ascension coordinate > 53.0829890 deg (i.e,
0.1′′ from the galaxy center) to remove the contamination from the foreground source.
Figure 3 shows the normalized surface brightness profile for both targets. The emission
of JADES-GS-z14-0 is more extended than the light profile of the star (i.e., point-
like source) observed in the NIRCam field. JADES-GS-z14-0 is also more extended
than the surface brightness profile of GN-z11 [39] and GHZ2 [21]. On the other hand,
JADES-GS-z14-1 appears more compact and consistent with a point-like source.
We have also modeled the morphology of the galaxies with ForcePho, which
enables us to fit the light distribution of individual exposures across all filters simul-
taneously while taking into account the substantial change in the NIRCam PSF with
wavelength. In the F162M image, JADES-GS-z14-0 is near to the edge of or entirely
missed by a number of the individual exposures from the 3215 program. By modeling
the individual exposures simultaneously ForcePho avoids the correlated noise caused
by mosaicing, which can be particularly difficult to quantify when the source is near
a large gradient in exposure time such as JADES-GS-z14-0. We have adopted a single
S´ersic profile for the z ∼14 galaxies and for the foreground sources within 5 arcsec
from the targets. ForcePho fits these profiles simultaneously and with full posterior
sampling, allowing us to measure the uncertainties in the profile and the covariance
of the fluxes between sources that appear blended, such as JADES-GS-z14-0 and its
low redshift neighbor.
Data, residual, and model are in Fig. 14. A single component is sufficient to match
the data of both JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1. In both cases, the surface
brightness profile is consistent with an S´ersic profile with an index of ∼1. For the
brightest of the two galaxies, we have determined a de-convolved half-light radius of
260 pc, while the compact size of JADES-GS-z14-1 has returned just an upper limit
of 160 pc.
Dust enrichment
Following Ferrara et al (2023) [40] and assuming the prescription Calzetti et al. (2000)
[77] for the dust attenuation law, AV could be used as a proxy for the dust mass:
Md ≈2.2 × 104AV (rd/100pc)2 M⊙, where rd is the radius over which the interstellar
medium dust is assumed to extend. However, we stress that the AV parameter is
not an accurate measure of the actual amount of dust as this parameter is simply
estimated from the spectral fitting assuming an dust attenuation law. Assuming that

z14-0 (top) and JADES-GS-z14-1 (bottom) in the multiple NIRCam bands. The figure shows that
the model has fit the data well within all bands without leaving significant residuals.
the spatial extension of the dust is as large as the size of the galaxy (i.e. rd = rUV),
we derived a dust mass Md = 5 × 104 M⊙and Md < 0.5 × 104 M⊙for the two
galaxies, respectively. Comparing these masses with the stellar masses, we find a dust-
to-stellar mass fraction of < 10−4 for both galaxies (Fig. 15), which is a factor > 10
lower than those inferred in galaxies at z ∼6 −7 [10−2 −10−3 43, 78, 79] and that
predicted by supernovae (SNe) models [42, 80]. Figure 15 shows the timescales to reach
the asymptotic dust-to-stellar mass ratio due to various dust enrichment processes
and assuming that galaxies formed at z = 20 from a single star-formation burst (see
review by ref. [42]). In the first few Myrs, the dust is dominated by SNe, and in less
than 5 Myr, the galaxy has already reached a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of ∼1/1000.
Even assuming a different realistic star-formation history, the dust-to-stellar mass
reaches the asymptotic values is < 10 Myr. Reverse shocks created by the interaction
between the expanding SN blast wave and the interstellar medium can limit the dust
enrichment by SNe. However, the efficiency of dust destruction due to reverse shocks
is still debated, and different models predict quite different survival rates [42].

branch (AGB) stars from a single star-formation burst at z = 20 [42]. Black circles illustrate the
dust-to-stellar mass ratio of JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1. A proxy of the dust masses of
the two z ∼14 galaxies has been estimated from the AV parameter, assuming that dust is distributed
in a sphere with a radius as large as the galaxy radius [40]. We also report in red squares the dust-
