engineering problem the first difficulty is usually to 
select from f\ mass of irrelevant detail the particnlar 
facts that bear on the problem. In most examina-
tion questions only the relevant data are givEln so 
that whitt is often the difficult part, the recognition of 
what is relevant, is already done. It might be more 
realistic and a better teHt of j1l'igment if students 
wero presented with a wide selection of datlt much of 
it irrelevant. and left to sort it out for them~elves. 
If I have said more about the auxiliary problems of 
developing skill and judgment. than about the main 
task of communicating knowledge, it is, first, because 
the former problems are less often considered by 
university teachers, and secondly, because I feel 
myself better qualified to discuss them . 
Cultural Development 
The final queFltion I have had to think about is one 
which has bElen puhlicly discnssed a good deal lately: 
How far should purely cultural studies be included in 
an engineering course? A report by the Americltn 
Society for Engineering Education puhlished in 1955 
suggests that about 20 per cent of total curriculum 
time should be allowed for "humanistic and social 
studies"". The subject was dealt with at length in 
Sir Eric Ashbv'R Ballard-Matthews Lectures' and in a 
British Association report entitled The Oomplete 
Scientist but better known as the Linstead ReportlO. 
Both of these last aro concerned with broadening the 
education of scientists, technologists and engineers. 
The Linstead Report was drawn up by a committee 
of scientists and teltchers, and it treats both scientific 
and engineering education as though they were 
culturally equivalent. This is yet another example of 
what happens when you ignore the difltinctions I 
have been trying to point out. The basis of an honours 
course in pure science is the intensive study of one 
or two SUbjects. 
Such a study must necflssarily be 
narrow in orner to attain the requi~ite depth and 
there is therefore a rElal dan!<er that the purf' scientist 
may become culturally iRolated from other workElrs. 
In engineering, however, the boot is on the other foot. 
An engineer must have a working knowledge of a 
number of sciences ann techniques; the danger is 
not that his education will be too narrow, but that it 
may become too broad and shallow. 
The fact is that social sciences which might be 
considered as cultural subjects for the pure scientist 
are vocal ional for the engineer in the sense that he 
needs to apply them in his work. This includes such 
studies as eoonomics, communication of ideas and 
management-subjects which oan all be presented to 
studellts in a spirit whioh is humanist as well as 
utilitarian. In fact, an engineering COllrse can be as 
broad as is pract.icable in any university course with a 
Flub!'ltantial content of what are called liberal studies, 
without /:oin~ outside it.s own vocational field. 
Sir 
Eric Ashhy WaR strongly oprosed to the liberalizing 
of technical courses by what he oalled "sticking a few 
bits of the humanities on the out.side of the fabric of 
science and technology"". 
The liberalizing process 
should take placo from within, through the treatment 
of technical subjects in a humanist manner. So far as 
engineering is conoerned, I am sure this is right. 
Mter all, the formal lectures and course work are 
only one of several agencies by which university 
stunents are influenced and eoucated. TherE' are also 
the personal contActs with professors and t.utors, the 
social and cultural activities of the univl"rsity, and by 
no means least, the company and conversation of 
other intelligent young people.

RADIOACTIVITY IN MAN, BEAST AND FOOD 
By DR. A. T_ KREBS 
Director, Radiobiology Division, U.S. Army Medical Research Laboratory, Fort Knox 
T
HE complexity of the questions concerning the 
radioactivity of living beings. especially man, 
briefly present.eci in a previous report', has been 
demonstrated anew in recent work on the radium 
content of soft human tis;;ues ; in the detailed investi-
gation of the total a-activity of men. other animals 
and foodstuffs; and in the examination of still-living 
radium-poisoning and 
radium-treatment 
victims 
from the early 'twenties and 'thirties. The re@ult.s of 
recent research question the present concepts and 
ideas on raniation protection guides, on dangers 
from low-level radiation sources, and on possible 
hazards from fall-out and other man-made radia-
tions. 
Recent work cast doubts for the first time on the 
distribution of naturally incorporated radium in 
the body, maintaining that only about one-fourth of 
the total radium content of the body is deposited 
in the skeleton and approximately three-quarters in the 
soft tissues of man. 
Heretofore, 75 per cent was 
believed to be cumulated in the skeleton and only 
about 25 per cent in the soft tissues. Thus, such work 
also brings into question the role of the naturally 
incorporated radium as to possible genetic and 
somatic effect.'l. 
The new findings confirm the fact that in addition 
to radium-226 other a-emitting elements play a 
significant part in the total radioactivity of man, 
animal and food, leading to much higher radiation 
doses and higher daily-intake activities than previ-
ouslv assumed. 
Finally. they show the surprising result that 
individuals who have incorporated radium and 
thorium into their bodies in t.he early 'twenties and 
'thirties are still alive, 30-40 years after the incor-
poration, carrying to-day still up to 40 microcuries 
of radium in the body. 
In order to judge the implications which the recent 
studies will have on low-level radiation problems some 
details may illustrate the situation_

Radium Content of Soft Tissues 
,,:nile much systematic work has been done to 
determine the amollnt of radium-226 in the human 
skeleton unoer different environmental ann geo-
graphical conditions. the measurement of the radium 
content of soft tissues has been neglect,ed. In 1957, 
during the Conl!l"esf'ional Hearings 011 "The Nature of 
Fallout and Its Effect on Man", the Sub·Committee 
for Radiation, di!:';cnssing the doses delivered by 
radium·226 to soft tissues. especially testicular tissue, 
could only tentatively include some figures by Muth 
et al.". 
Final conclusions had to be postponed until 
more detailed information became available. 
Such data were published in 1960 by Muth, 
Rajewsky. Hantke, and Aurand", and by Hursh, 
Lovaas ann Biltz'. However, instead of simplifying 
the sitnation and allowing final conc!tlslOns, the 
published data indicate a much more complex problem 
than anticipateo. The oat.a given by Muth. Rajewsky, 
Hantke and Aurand' differ by faclora of up to 50 
from the figures reportE'd by Hursh, Lovaas and Biltz'. 
Thus. for example, liver tissue of European people 
contains at least II time!:'; and may be 23 times more 
radium-226 than liver tissnes from American indi-
viduals. and muscle tissue shows a 50 times higher 
activity in European t,han in American people. The 
reasons for these differences are not known. Several 
factors may enter into the picture: technical details, 
geographical conditions. environmental factors. living 
circumstances, as well as diotary habits. 
The dis-
similarity in the reported values is so much the more 
striking sincE' Rajewsky et al. 6 reported 191>7 values 
for the total radium content of the human body in 
agreement with the values given by Hursh and Gates· 
as well as Stehney and Lucas7• 
The consequences of the findings by Muth, Rajew-
sky. Hantke, and Aurand and by Hursh, Lovaas and 
Biltz are far-reaching. in so far as the natural levels 
of radiation and the Nature·given conditions form, 
according to Turner. Radley and Mayneord 8, the 
only sure basis on which the dangers from low-level 
radiation exposures can be estimated and discussed. 
Amounts and distribution of the naturally incor-
porated radium-226 influence greatly the dose-pattern 
to the different parts of the body and any significant 
new information about. the two factors must lead to 
a re-orientation of existing ooncepts. 
Thus, when 
Muth et al.a, from their measurements of tissue-activ-
ity, conclude that the skeleton of man oontains only 
about onfl·fourth of the total radium content of the 
body, while Hursh et al.' arrive at a figure of about 
78 per cent for the radium content of the skeleton-
leaving about 75 per oent of the total radillm content 
for soft tissue in the case of the measurements oj 
Muth. Rajewsky et al., and only about 22 per cent of 
the radium content for all soft tissues according to 
Hursh et al.-serious implications must arise in the 
judgment of possible genetic effects as well as 
somatic effects, such as increase in production of bone 
tumours and leukemia over the generations. 
a-Activity of Man, Beast and Food 
'The role of the a.activity in the total radiation 
burden to the body from naturally incorporated 
radioactive substances has been discussed in detail 
by me and by Hursh. 
While I emphasized from 
the beginning a possible contribution of ex·emit-
ting members of the uranium and thorium families 
to the total radioactivity of the human", Hursh 
concluded from theoretical oonsiderations and cal-
culations that it was sufficient to measure radium-226

oarbon-14, potassium-40, radillm-226. radon-222 and 
bismuth-214 (RaG) would not make important 
oontributions to the total-body aotivity. either on 
aocount of short half-life, negligible absorption by 
the body, low solubility or a combination of these 
faotors, 
excluding especially the occurrence of 
thorium-228 in amounts comparable to the stored 
radium-226 (ref. 10). 
The dilemma found an interest.ing solution when 
Mayneord et al. started some years ago systematio 
work on the a.activity of livin~ and dead materials. 
Using modem sointillation techniques amI iIlgenious 
devices, Mayneord, Radley and Turner". and Turner 
Radley and Mayneord 12 found surprisingly high 
a-actidties, especially in food, attributable to mem-
bers of the uranium and thorium families. 
Bones of people from the Cumberland region in 
Great Britain showed ex·aotivities of up to 9 x 10-13 
c./gm. bone ash with an average value of 5·0 x 10-13 
c./gm. of bone ash. 
Feople from the London area 
showed an average content of 1·7 x 10-13 c. a-activity/ 
gm. bone ash. 
The ex-activity found in stillborn 
children was high in oomparison with the radium 
content reported by Hursh and Gat,es for stillborn 
children: in the average 4·5 x 10-13 c. a·activity/gm. 
bone ash in oomparison to an average radium con-
tent of 0·36 x 10-13 c./gm. ash of infant carcasses. 
Table 1 presents, in addition to the a-aotivities 
found in human beings, some figures for animals, 
different foodstuffs and soils according to Mayneord 
et al. H •n . 
Special disturbance arose from the obAervation that 
Brazil nuts, con!lumed in England in great quantities, 
show about 14,000 timet< higher a-acth'ity than fruits 
and vegetahl(ls (Table 1). 
In evaluating their findings Mayneord et al. con-
eluded: (1) Solid food is the deciRive factor in the 
daily intake of naturally occurring radioactive 
materials; its contribution surpasses that of milk 
and of water. hitherto believod to be the main 
sources of body af'tivity. 
(2) The daily iI.take of 
active materials oan come close to the whole-body 
activity; adults may incorporate more than 10-" c. a 
day. 
(3) Two persons on apparently normal diets 
may differ in total daily radioactivity intake by factors 
of hundreds, thus explaining the v8a'iations found 
in the human skeleton studies.

Examination of Stili-living Radium 
Po:soning and Radium Treatment Cases 
from the Early 'Twenties and 'Thirties 
The third observation deals with the late effects 
of high amounts of radium and thorium, incorporated 
up to forty years ago by the luminous dial painters 
(radium poisoning cases), by patients therapeutically 
(orally and intravenously) treated with radium, and 
by people drinking radium water as tonic and elixir 
(radium drink cures). 
Recognizing the importance of these cases, especi. 
ally for the understanding of the mechanisms in 
which biological changes are produced by incorporated 
radioactive elements and for the establishment of 
reliable radiation protection guides, a systematic 
effort was made by different institutions in rocent 
yearsl• to find and locate still living persons of these 
groups. To.day, more than five hundred cases have 
been contacted and are bping examincd at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Radioactivity 
Center. Argonne National Laboratory, Naval Medical 
Center, and other institutions. R. D. Evans and his 
groupU, W. B. Looney et al., Brues, Finkel, Miller, 
Marinelli and team, together with other investigators 
and groups, have collected in the examination of 
theBe cases valuable, in their consequences far· 
reaching, data. 
These 'radium·victims' must have 
been exposed for long periods of their life to high 
doses from not yet excreted radioactive materials, 
not to forget the originally incorporated amounts, 
which according to R. D. Evans14 and Norris et al. 15 
must have been several hundred times the safe dose. 
R. E. Rowland'· has recently reported some 
interesting findings in nineteen cases which carried 
radium from a mimimum of ten years to a maximum 
of forty years with body burdens from 20 f.Lc. down 
to about 1 f.Lc. 
Rowland describes in details the two 
distribution patterns found in these cases: the so·called 
'diffuse' distribution and the 'hot spot' distribution 
and gives interesting micro· radiographs and auto· 
radiographs of hot spots. Among others he demon. 
strated the femur of a woman who, at the age of 
thirtv·two, received 41 weekly injections of 10 f.Lc. 
radi~m·226 and died twenty.four years later with a 
terminal burden of 3·6 f.Lc. 
The 'minimum life·time 
doses' (terminal dose·rates, multiplied by the number 
of days the activity was carried) in these peopltls 
can be tremendous, as "hown in Table 2, which 
gives selected values from Rowland's data. 
As to the effect of these doses on the individual, 
Rowland mentions that these cases, with a few excep· 
tions, were discovered to be radium cases as a result

of their symptoms. Four out of the 19 eases-Q, I, 
118 and 03473-were without what may be concluded 
to be radiation·induced tumours. More information 
about the effects of high doses from incorporated 
radium on the individual will become available from 
a present investigation at Argonne National Labora-
tory of some 180 former dial painters I. . Of course, 
there are problems in interpreting the fmdings in the 
different cases. 
Snyderl7, for example, pointed out 
that we do not know whether the malignancies found 
in these eases after so many years are attributable 
to the high dose·rates the bone received in the early 
time after incorporation or whether they should be 
attributed to the continuous irradiation of the bone 
in excess of a certain level throughout the entire 
history of the case. 
The long survival times of 
persons with high radium burdens are surprising and 
require more detailed observation and study. 
The foregoing accounts on the present situation ofre· 
search in the field of total.body radioactivity show 
some of the problems encountered in the endeavour to 
determine qualitatively and quantitatively the kind of 
radioisotopes incorporated daily by living systems. their 
amounts and their distribution in the intact organism. 
The situation is quite complex, and additive 
information appears as mentioned by Stehney18 to 
increase the difficulty to come to conclusions, except 
the one: that only uncertain generalizations can be 
made from the analysis on subjects of tmlmown origin. 
However, the problems arising in connexion with 
the present increase in radiation sources, with the 
possibility of repeated and extended exposures of 
great populations, made it mandatory to find ~Jaso , 
lines on which the dangors from man·made enVIron· 
mental contamination and other low·level radiation 
sources, illcluding some of the space radiations, can 
be estimated and evaluated. 
The study of the Nature·given radioactivity in 
living systems and its dependence on ex.ternal and 
internal factors is one way to approach thIS problem.
