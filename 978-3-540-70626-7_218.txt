Superposition Principle
(Coherent and Incoherent Superposition)
Marianne Breinig
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the state of a physical system at a ﬁxed time
t is deﬁned by specifying a ket |ψ(t)⟩belonging to the space ε. ε is a complex,
separable  Hilbert space, a complex linear vector space in which an inner product
is deﬁned and which possesses a countable  orthonormal basis. Every measurable
physical quantity is called an observable and is described by a Hermitian opera-
tor acting in ε. The only possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of
the Hermitian operator associated with the measurement, and immediately after the
measurement the state ket is a corresponding eigenstate. Every Hermitian operator
has at least one basis of orthonormal eigenvectors. Every state vector |ψ(t)⟩can
therefore be written as a linear superposition of eigenvectors of any observable. If
two Hermitian operators commute a common eigenbasis can be found. If they do
not commute, then no common eigenbasis exists.
Let {|an⟩} be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of the operator A,
A |an⟩= an| an⟩.

Superposition Principle (Coherent and Incoherent Superposition)
For simplicity assume that the eigenvalues are not degenerate. Let |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩be
two normalized eigenvectors of the operator B with eigenvalues b1 and b2, respec-
tively.
B|ψ1⟩= b1|ψ1⟩, B|ψ2⟩= b2|ψ2⟩.
(2)
If B is the Hamiltonian H, then b1 = E1 and b2 = E2. If A and B do not commute,
i.e. [A, B] ̸= 0, then |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩are linear superpositions of eigenvectors of A.
Assume that [A, B] ̸= 0 and that a measurement at t = 0 determines |ψ(0)⟩=
|ψ1⟩. If B is the Hamiltonian, then the measurement determines that the system
is in a stationary state. The probability that a subsequent measurement of A will
yield the eigenvalue an is P1(an) = |⟨an|ψ1⟩|2. Similarly, if |ψ(0)⟩= |ψ2⟩then
P2(an) = |⟨an|ψ2⟩|2. Now consider a system in a normalized pure state ( states,
pure and mixed)
|ψ⟩= λ1|ψ1⟩+ λ1|ψ2⟩, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1, |λ1|2 + |λ2|2 = 1.
(3)
If B is the Hamiltonian, then the system is not in a stationary state, it is in a coherent
superposition of stationary states.
The probability that a measurement of B will yield b1 is |⟨ψ1|ψ⟩|2 = |λ1|2. The
probability that a measurement of B will yield b2 is |λ2|2. The probability that a
measurement of A will yield an is
P (an) = |⟨an| ψ⟩|2
= ⟨an|ψ⟩⟨ψ |an⟩=| λ1|2P1 (an) +|λ2|2P2 (an)
+2Re(λ1λ∗
2 × ⟨an|ψ1⟩⟨ψ2|an⟩)
̸= |λ1|2P1 (an) +|λ2|2P2 (an) .
(4)
The last term in the expression for P(an) describes interference effects. If a system
is in a pure state which is a coherent superposition of eigenstates of an observable
B and we measure an observable A which does not commute with B, then we must
take interference effects into account when predicting the result of a measurement.
We may consider P(an) = |⟨an|ψ⟩|2 as the square of the probability amplitude
⟨an|ψ⟩= ⟨an|λ1ψ1⟩+ ⟨an|λ2ψ2⟩. The probability amplitude is the weighted sum
of the probability amplitudes ⟨an|ψ1⟩and ⟨an|ψ2⟩. To obtain the probability P(an)
for a linear superposition of states, we take the square of the weighted sum of the
probability amplitudes, not the sum of the squares.
A pure state is not a statistical mixture of states. The concept of a statistical
mixture of states ( mixed state) is used when dealing with incomplete informa-
tion about the initial state of a system. Assume it is only known that the system
is in one of the eigenstates {|ψk⟩} of the operator B and that it has the probability
pk (
k pk = 1) of being in the pure state |ψk⟩. If B is the Hamiltonian, the system
then is in an incoherent superposition of stationary states. If the system is in a sta-
tistical mixture of the states |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩with weights p1 = |λ1|2 and p2 = |λ2|2
respectively, then the probability of measuring an is P(an) = |λ1|2 P1(an) + |λ2|2

Superselection Rules

P2(an). Interference effects are absent for an incoherent superposition or a statistical
mixture of states. We cannot describe a statistical mixture using an “average state
vector”. In general, when dealing with a statistical mixture, probabilities enter at
two levels. The initial information about the system is given in terms of probabili-
ties, and the predictions of Quantum Mechanics are probabilistic.
A simple example:
Let the operator B be the Hamiltonian of the system, B = H, b1 = E1, b2 = E2,
and let |ψ(0)⟩= λ1|ψ1⟩+ λ1|ψ2⟩. Then |ψ(t)⟩= λ1 exp(−iE1t/ℏ)|ψ1⟩+ λ2
exp(−iE2t/ℏ)|ψ2⟩, and
P (an)= |λ1|2 P1 (an) + |λ2|2 P2 (an)
+2Re(λ1λ∗
2 × exp(−i (E1 −E2) t/ℏ)⟨an|ψ1⟩⟨ψ2|an⟩)
P(an) now is time dependent and oscillates with a frequency ν12 = (E1 −E2)/h.
We observe quantum beats.

Superselection Rules
Domenico Giulini
General Notion
The notion of superselection rule (henceforth abbreviated SSR) was introduced in
1952 by Wick (1909–1992), Wightman, and Wigner (1902–1995) [9] in connection
with the problem of consistently assigning intrinsic parity to elementary particles.
They understood an SSR as generally expressing “restrictions on the nature and
scope of possible measurements”.
The concept of SSR should be contrasted with that of an ordinary  selec-
tion rule (SR). The latter refers to a dynamical inhibition of a certain transition,
