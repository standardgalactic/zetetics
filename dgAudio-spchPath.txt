GENERAL

Foreword 
1.1
VA Program Offices, project teams, designers and constructors, are obligated to our Nation's 
Veterans and taxpayers to make the most effective and efficient use of resources, by providing 
a continuum of safe, secure, high quality, high performance, and high value environments of 
care and service for Veterans.  The VA Office of Construction and Facilities Management 
(CFM) supports the Department's mission through development and application of standards 
as a basis for disciplined planning, design, and construction of VA facilities. 
VA Standards are the culmination of a partnership among the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA), the Veterans Health Administration, Program Officials, Clinicians, Industry, Academic and 
Research Organizations, Expert Consultants, and the Office of Construction and Facilities 
Management.  Design Guides are developed through integration of VA-specific requirements, 
Federal law and regulation, benchmarking of industry best practice, evidence-based research 
and design, and value-based analysis of leading edge innovation.  The result is the 
establishment of best value standards for optimum functionality, safety, operability, 
performance, and quality throughout the VA environment of care and service.   
Design Guides (PG-18-12) are a critical component of the VA Technical Information Library 
(TIL) (www.cfm.va.gov/TIL) which provides standards for all VA planning, design, and 
construction projects.  Design Guides focus on selected healthcare departments and services 
and include an overview narrative of VA-specific planning and design principles and concepts, 
room templates, equipment lists, and basic technical/engineering requirements.  They 
communicate the basis of design and are required to be utilized by project teams working on 
new construction and renovations of existing facilities.  Design Guides will maximize the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the planning and design process and ensure a high level of 
design, while controlling construction, operating, and maintenance costs. 
The material contained in Design Guides constitutes a Standard for VA Planning, Design, and 
Construction.  For all VA projects, it is required that project teams comply with the following in 
all phases of project development:  
1. All applicable VA Standards published in the VA Technical Information Library (TIL) shall 
be applied as a basis, foundation, and framework in planning, design, and construction.  
Any substantial variance from Standards shall be considered only as required to 
accommodate specific site, functional, and operational conditions.  Upon consideration 
of variance CFM shall be consulted, and each Administration will function as Authority 
Having Jurisdiction for decision.  Each substantial variance shall have a basis rationale 
and be documented in the project record   
2. Clinicians, providers, primary users, and other stakeholders shall be involved in all 
phases of project development to best adapt Standards for specific functional, 
operational, and site conditions, and to provide optimum service environments for 
Veterans.  This also includes installations and modifications of systems or technology 
involving safety, security, functionality, or environmental quality.  Stakeholder 
involvement shall be documented in the project record.

Page   1-2 
Design Guides are not project‐specific.  It is impossible to foresee all rapidly evolving 
requirements of healthcare facilities and each site or project will have unique requirements or 
conditions.  Site‐specific issues must be addressed within the context of these standards and 
applied to each individual project.  Use of this Guide does not preclude the need for, nor 
absolve planners, designers, and constructors of their responsibility to provide complete, 
functional, safe, and secure designs suited to the unique requirements of each project, within 
budget, and on schedule.  
Materials, equipment, and systems are shown in an illustrative, performance-based format and 
are not intended to depict, suggest, or otherwise constitute endorsement of any specific 
product or manufacturer.  Manufacturers should be consulted for actual dimensions, 
configurations, and utility requirements.  
All participants in the project development process must embrace VA Planning, Design, and 
Construction Standards as fundamental in providing optimum environments for Veterans’ care 
and services, in fulfilling VA's mission.

Introduction 
The Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide (PG-18-12) is a design tool for VA Medical Center 
staff, planners architects, interior designers, project design teams, and consulting architects and 
engineers (A/E’s) to assist with understanding the unique functional and technical requirements 
associated with these patient care services.  The Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Design 
Guide is the first edition of this publication and supplements PG-18-9, Chapter 204: Audiology and 
Speech-Language Pathology Services (ASPS) Space Planning Criteria, which has been concurrently 
updated.  The ASPS Design Guide enhances CFM’s Technical Information Library (TIL) of published 
Design Guides for other services (VA TIL Design Guides).  
The Design Guide represents the planning and design standards that have been developed to support 
the delivery of care for ASPS and is not intended to be project-specific, nor is it crafted as a code.  It 
addresses general space and equipment planning, as well as the functional, technical, and systems 
requirements for functional areas associated with Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology services.  
The narrative and graphic material developed in this document are based on site visits of both recently 
built/renovated and older facilities, staff interviews, collaborative work sessions and meetings, and 
research of relevant publications and standards.

supplies, and similar items not typically required for routine operation in the healthcare facility. 
C 
Case Mix – Method of categorizing patients into statistically and clinically homogenous groups based 
on the collections of clinical and administrative data.  Adjusting for patients of different levels of 
acuity forms the basis for healthcare organization comparisons and case mix adjusted resource 
utilization. 
Ceiling Attenuation Class (CAC) – A measure for rating the performance of a ceiling system as a 
barrier to airborne sound transmission through a common plenum between adjacent closed spaces, 
such as offices.  A ceiling system with a CAC < 25 is considered low performance, whereas one

for a couch area.  The type of light and its placement is based on an area use.  Lights for each area 
are controlled individually so the unused areas do not need to be lit until necessary.  USGBC 
energy efficiency requirements for LEED Certification call for individual controls for task lighting. 
Technical Information Library (TIL) – The Office of Construction & Facilities Management (CFM) 
provides support for all major construction and lease projects.  The TIL contains design and 
construction standards for the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The TIL is aimed at VA employees 
in medical centers, community based clinics, regional offices, and national cemeteries as well as 
A/E consultants and provides relevant technical information for project development.  Department of

Telehealth – The use of technology, such as computers and mobile devices, to manage healthcare 
remotely.  It includes a variety of health care services, including but not limited to online support 
groups, online health information and self-management tools, email and online communication with 
health care providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, video or online doctor visits.  Depending on 
the concept of operations for this space, it may be equipped as an exam room or as a consult room 
with video/camera capability. 
Tinnitus – A sensation of noise (as a ringing or roaring) that is caused by a bodily condition (as a 
disturbance of the auditory nerve or wax in the ear) and typically is of the subjective form which can 
only be heard by the one affected. 
Tracheoesophageal Voice Prosthesis (TEP) – A device that is placed in the wall that separates the 
trachea and esophagus in order to enable a total laryngectomy patient to make voice. 
Transport Cart – A mobile cart used to transport instruments, scopes, or supplies within a medical 
facility, most often between Sterile Processing Service and patient care areas; also referred to as 
Transfer Cart. 
U 
Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) – Generators, batteries, and/or associated equipment that 
provide continuous electrical power, preventing power loss to critical functions that rely on absolute 
continuity of service. 
Unique Patients – Count of unduplicated social security numbers (SSNs), using health care services 
provided by or funded by VA, to include VHA, VISN, Medical Center, or division/CBOC, for the 
selected time period.   
V 
Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy – An exercise-based program designed to promote central nervous 
system compensation for inner ear deficits. 
Vestibulography – A general class of special balance tests including, videonystagmography (VNG), 
and sinusoidal vertical axis rotational testing (rotary chair).  These tests record nystagmus and eye 
movements to diagnosis peripheral and central vestibular disorders. 
Videonystagmography (VNG) – A technology for testing inner ear and central motor functions, a 
process known as vestibular assessment.  It involves the use of infrared goggles to trace eye 
movements during visual stimulation and positional changes. 
Vocational Rehabilitation Therapy (VRT) – An assessment process that determines the jobs that are 
best suited for an individual through the use of interviews, evaluation of abilities, and tests of 
manual and physical skills.  VRT services are associated most often with Employment Services 
Program and there is a renewed interest in this program associated with the VA’s younger 
population. 
W 
Wait times – Time elapsed from when a Veteran requests an appointment for medical services and 
when the appointment is scheduled.

Workload – The anticipated number of procedures that are processed through a department/service 
area.  The total workload applied to departmental operational assumptions will determine overall 
room requirements by modality. 
Workplane – An imaginary horizontal plane situated at the nominal working height in an interior space.  
Most illuminance and daylight factor measurements and calculations are made for points on this 
plane. 
Workstation – Area outfitted with equipment and furnishings, typically allocated 56 NSF each.  
Managers and other staff with no direct reports as well as part-time, seasonal, and job-sharing staff 
may qualify for a workstation.  Such environments are particularly conducive to team-oriented office 
groupings.  These environments work best when they have access to conference and small group 
meeting spaces.

Clinical and Operational Summary 
2.1.1
 Service Structure/Organization 
1.
General 
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology are organizationally linked within Veterans Health 
Administration Patient Care Services.  Along with other parallel programs, the VA Audiology 
and Speech-Language Pathology Service (ASPS) falls under the Office of Rehabilitation and 
Prosthetic Services (refer to ""
).  
The Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Service is dedicated to three major goals 
(U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs - Patient Care Services): 
• 
Providing high quality, comprehensive, state-of-the-art clinical services to veterans with 
hearing, tinnitus, balance, speech, language, voice, and swallowing disorders 
• 
Supporting the training of developing audiologists and speech pathologists 
• 
Conducting research to improve technologies, methodologies, treatment efficacy, and 
associated elements of patient care 
Figure 1: Rehabilitation and Prosthetic Service Diagram (based on the following source: VA Patient Care-Rehabilitation 
Services) 
Organizational Structure and Staffing 
The specific organizational structure of the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology 
Service is determined locally.  Most commonly, the Chief of Audiology and Speech-Language 
Pathology reports as a Service Chief to the Chief of Staff, or as a Section Chief(s) to the Chief 
of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service.  Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology 
clinic caregivers and staff at a VA Medical Center typically include the following: 
• 
Service and/or Section Chief (Audiologist and/or Speech Pathologist) 
• 
Assistant Section Chief 
• 
Audiologist(s) 
• 
Speech-Language Pathologist(s) 
• 
Audiology and/or Speech-Language Pathology Health Technician(s) 
• 
Administrative Officer

Page   2-2 
• 
Administrative Assistant(s)/Clerical Staff 
• 
Residents/Students 
The Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology service at Community Based Outpatient Clinic 
(CBOC) locations (or other non-VAMC locations) is staffed with associated service providers 
depending on the size of the facility: 
• 
Audiologist(s) 
• 
Speech-Language Pathologist(s) 
• 
Audiology and/or Speech-Language Pathology Health Technician(s) 
CBOC locations generally do not house the Service or Section Chief and associated 
administrative staff (such as, Assistant Service Chief, Administrative Officer, etc.).  Other 
administrative staff (such as, receptionist/check-in clerk) may be shared with adjacent specialty 
clinics.  Providers may conduct administrative functions in a shared office or team work area. 
Care Delivery and Patient Demographics 
In accordance with the VHA Directive for the services, it is policy that “facilities provide access 
to integrated, specialized, evidence-based audiology, and speech pathology services.  These 
services should optimize the individual Veteran patient’s ability to function by eliminating or 
reducing his/her impairment, activity limitations, participation restrictions, and environmental 
barriers related to hearing, tinnitus, balance, speech, language, voice, and swallowing 
disorders” (Dept. of Veterans Affairs, VHA Draft Service Directive ASPS, 2016). 
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology services are ideally collocated as a dedicated 
specialty clinic within either a VA Medical Center (VAMC) or Outpatient Clinic setting.  While 
space constraints have, in some cases, led to dispersed services, collocation of Audiology and 
Speech Pathology allows for sharing of administrative staff as well as staff collaboration for the 
care of a common patient population, including those with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and 
neurocognitive disorders.  Often, patients seeking treatment in both services have multiple 
physical and cognitive disabilities. 
The VA patient population for Audiology is predominantly outpatient; however, Audiologists 
also regularly perform diagnostics and treatments for inpatients.  By comparison, the patient 
population for Speech-Language Pathology is approximately 50% inpatient and 50% 
outpatient.  Speech-Language Pathology services have historically been located at VA Medical 
Centers due to the complexity of procedures, strong relationship with other VAMC based 
services, required competencies, and the cost of specialized equipment.  However, Speech 
Pathology is beginning to have a presence in outpatient clinics.  Advances in Telemedicine 
technologies have permitted remote treatment and diagnosis of patients for both services.  
Refer to.2.1.2.2 Telehealth for further discussion. 
Service Relationships 
Significant inpatient/outpatient service relationships for Audiology and Speech-Language 
Pathology at VAMC and offsite facilities are illustrated in Figure 2.  Both Audiologists and 
Speech Pathologists provide care for Community Living Center (CLC) residents and, to a 
limited degree, Polytrauma, and Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) patients at VAMCs.  Dedicated space 
for Speech Therapists/Therapy may be authorized at CLCs and Polytrauma Rehab Centers 
(PRCs) to accommodate these functions at VAMC campuses.  Likewise, offsite CBOCs likely 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-3 
have both Audiology and, to a limited degree, Speech Pathology space, while offsite CLCs may 
have dedicated Speech Pathology space only, necessitating travel by Audiologists between the 
medical center and CLC to administer care.

Trends 
2.1.2
 VA Trends 
1.
The growing number of older Veterans and an influx of a new generation of combat Veterans 
from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn 
(OEF/OIF/OND) are resulting in an increased prevalence of Veterans with disorders of hearing, 
balance, speech, language, cognition, and swallowing.  Auditory system disabilities, including 
hearing loss and tinnitus, are among the most common service-related disabilities.  High 
incidences of traumatic brain injury and post-concussive symptoms reported over the last 
decade have resulted in increased rates of sensory and cognitive-communication complaints 
(Dept. of Veterans Affairs, VHA Draft Service Directive ASPS, 2016). 
Emerging challenges for VHA audiology and speech pathology programs include: increasing 
prevalence of age-related and trauma-related disorders of communication, cognition, 
swallowing, hearing, and balance; greater demand for compensation and pension evaluation 
services; rapidly changing treatment technologies and paradigms; expanding scope of practice; 
changing care delivery models; and an aging workforce (Dept. of Veterans Affairs, VHA Draft 
Service Directive ASPS, 2016).  Additional challenges and trends include: 
• 
Open access leading to unscheduled/walk-in patients 
• 
Telehealth 
 Telehealth 
2.
The expanding opportunities relative to telehealth/telemedicine for the delivery of both 
Audiology and Speech Pathology services in VA are well documented in numerous recent 
JRRD (Journal of Rehabilitation and Research Development) publications (Jacobs PG, 2014) 
(Smith, 2013) (Henry, 2012)  and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs publications (for 
instance: (Vantage Point, 2015)).  Rapidly emerging technologies, recognition of the benefits, 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-5 
wider acceptance of the service model by both providers and patients, and the gradual erosion 
of barriers have contributed to the advancement of programs.  The VA has provided significant 
leadership in the development of teleaudiology programs, particularly in the U.S. since 2009 
(Jacobs PG, 2014).  
Benefits 
Research findings indicate that teleaudiology and other telehealth services (such as for Speech 
Pathology) greatly improve access in rural communities, are cost effective, and benefit integrated 
care (such as between Audiologists and Mental Health professionals) (Jacobs PG, 2014); (Smith, 
2013); (Henry, 2012). 
With an estimated 37% of enrolled Veterans living in rural areas and drive times exceeding two 
hours or more for those in highly rural areas (Jacobs PG, 2014), VA’s efforts to expand access 
via CBOC’s over the last five years coincides with the recognition of the potential benefits of 
telehealth.  In one study which analyzes telehealth use relative to Comprehensive TBI 
Evaluation (CTBIE) (Smith, 2013), research data indicate that the highest percentage of 
requested telehealth consults were for speech-language pathology and audiology. 
Programs 
Emerging and established teleaudiology 
and telehealth programs include (Jacobs 
PG, 2014): 
• 
Clinical video telehealth: face-to-face 
video-conferencing between patients 
and providers involves 
synchronous/real-time data collection 
for conducting hearing tests, hearing 
aid fittings and audiologist-directed 
real-ear measures, hearing-aid 
counseling, and tinnitus management 
(refer to Figure 3).   
Figure 3: Teleaudiology Encounter; Source:  
VA Blogs-Telehealth saves Florida-veteran time travel 
• 
Store and forward telehealth: data 
acquired and stored by a technician 
at a remote facility is later forwarded 
to a specialist for interpretation and diagnosis.  Examples include video otoscopy, 
audiometry, immittance, otoacoustic emissions, and auditory brain stem (ABR) response 
readings. 
• 
Remote monitoring (“home telehealth”): uses mobile devices to collect data that can be 
monitored by healthcare providers, such as monitoring hearing aid use or changes in 
hearing over time. 
• 
Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM): Uses education and counseling to help patients 
learn how to self-manage their reactions to tinnitus; the program has been adapted by 
delivering the intervention via telephone and adding cognitive-behavioral therapy.  
Research indicates that this treatment facilitates an integrated approach to tinnitus 
management for persons with or without TBI since there is a correlation between patients 
experiencing significant tinnitus and depression/anxiety (Henry, 2012). 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-6 
 
• 
Mobile health: Smartphone applications (apps) or other software is used for self-
management, independent of the practitioner.  Readily available apps include those for 
hearing testing, auditory training, tinnitus management, and hearing aid counseling.  This 
software is also being used to remotely adjust hearing aids (refer to Figure 4). 
Figure 4: An audiologist at the Cleveland Medical Center 
adjusts his patient’s hearing aids during a telehealth 
appointment; Source:  
VA Blogs-Need an audiologist?  There's an app for that. 
For Speech Pathology services, speech 
and language therapy, and some swallow 
evaluations may be conducted via 
telehealth. 
Barriers and Facility Considerations 
Reported barriers to implementation of 
teleaudiology and telehealth programs 
include ( (Jacobs PG, 2014) (Smith, 
2013)): 
• 
Scheduling challenges (coordinating 
schedules between two sites, 
scheduling space); “setting up the 
clinic” (equipment and space) 
• 
Conducting a physical exam over a 
virtual modality (providers rely on the 
telehealth clinical technician [TCT] to 
be their hands); ensuring privacy of personal health information 
• 
Ensuring reimbursement; training and skills development relative to the technologies; and 
user/patient access to technology  
As Audiology and Speech Pathology clinicians gain acceptance of telehealth as a form of 
practice, development of appropriate space and equipment to support the clinical activities will 
help facilitate adoption and implementation.  These considerations are further discussed 
relative to teleaudiology and telehealth for Speech-Language Pathology in the functional and 
technical sections (2.2 and 2.3, respectively) of this document.

Functional Considerations 
2.2
 
General 
2.2.1
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology services involve complex diagnostics and 
treatments requiring highly specialized space, equipment, and infrastructure (VHA ASPS, 
Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-17).  Although the two services are 
organizationally joined, distinct differences exist with respect to functions, patient care, and 
support activities.  On the other hand, the services have significant common functional 
relationships with other Rehabilitation and Prosthetics Services, including Physical Medicine 
and Rehab (PM&R) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), as well as with other hospital/inpatient 
and outpatient services, including ENT (VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field 
Surveys, 2016-17). 
 Functional Areas 
1.
For planning purposes, based on distinct functions, the Audiology and Speech-Language 
Pathology Service (ASPS) is organized into six Functional Areas (FAs).  Refer to PG-18-9 
Chapter 204: Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Services Space Planning Criteria.  
These are: 
• 
FA-1 Reception Area 
• 
FA-2 Audiology Clinic Patient Area 
• 
FA-3 Speech-Language Pathology Clinic Patient Area 
• 
FA-4 Support Area 
• 
FA-5 Staff and Administrative Area 
• 
FA-6 Education Area 
Refer to Sections 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 for discussion of key spaces associated with the Functional 
Areas. 
 
Medical Center/Hospital Setting 
2.2.2
 Department Location 
1.
At VA Medical Centers, Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (ASPS) is best collocated 
in a clinical setting with dedicated space planned to accommodate the specialized functional 
requirements of the services.  Convenient access to the main or outpatient building entrance is 
preferred; however, if the department is located on a floor other than the entry level, proximity 
to vertical transportation is recommended.  Although it is critical to maintain separation from 
busy and noisy areas, such as the main lobby or canteen, wayfinding to the department is a 
significant consideration due to the large number of outpatients, particularly for Audiology.  
Clear and intuitive wayfinding as well as convenient location are also important since patients 
and family members may have a variety of physical and cognitive disabilities, including balance 
disorders.   
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology may be located in an outpatient area of a Medical 
Center or in a clinic close to other related services, such as PM&R and ENT.  When planning 
for the location of the service at a VAMC, the relationship between ASPS and other inpatient, 
residential, and support services such as Intensive Care, CLC, and Sterile Processing shall 
also be considered.  Proximity to vertical transportation for access to departments that may be 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-8 
on other floors of the facility for staff convenience and to facilitate efficient workflow is 
important.  Refer to Figure 5 and Appendix 5.2 for diagrams of representative VAMC ASPS 
clinics, such as at Bay Pines (C.W. Young VAMC) and Orlando VAMC (Lake Nona), which 
illustrate examples of these functional relationships. 
Figure 5: Functional Relationship Diagram – Bay Pines, FL 
 Department Functional Relationships 
2.
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology have direct service relationships with other 
departments at a typical VA Medical Center.  ASPS and PM&R often have common patients, 
and a strong adjacency between ENT and Audiology is important for patients who often need 
to navigate between these departments during a single visit.  The functional relationship 
between ASPS and inpatient nursing units as well as the Emergency Department is an 
important planning consideration.  Providers treat patients at their bedside, and patients are 
sometimes transported to the department on beds/gurneys.  Fluoroscopic exam of swallow 
function (also known as Modified Barium Swallow (MBS)) is performed in Radiology and is a 
consideration for service proximity between Speech Pathology and Radiology.   
A key support service relationship exists between Sterile Processing (SPS) and ASPS.  
Speech Pathology has unique requirements relative to scope handling protocols.  Some 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-9 
Audiology devices, such as small instruments used for cerumen management, may also be 
processed through SPS, although Medical Centers are increasingly requiring that all 
instruments for cerumen removal be single use/disposable. 
While direct adjacency between the Canteen and ASPS is not advised due to noise/traffic, 
convenient access is helpful for patients, family members, and staff due to the length of some 
procedures. 
Key services and departmental relationships in a VAMC setting are illustrated in Figure 6.  
Figure 6: Departmental Relationships – VAMC Audiology and Speech Pathology Service 
 Service Proximity 
3.
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology services along with all associated 
functions/activities are ideally collocated in a single clinic at a VA Medical Center, in order to 
facilitate staff collaboration for the care of common patients, and for operational efficiencies in 
terms of shared support and administrative/staff functions. 
In circumstances where space constraints or other limitations require service separation, 
Speech-Language Pathology may be located in another part of the facility, such as on another 
level proximate to inpatient services and/or an outpatient procedure area.  If Speech-Language 
Pathology is separated, it must have all associated support and administrative functions 
collocated in order to function as an independent clinic.  Provisions for connections to other 
patient care or support services via vertical transportation and good wayfinding are also 
important in such circumstances, particularly since Speech-Language Pathology is, in general, 
a smaller service in terms of both workload and footprint relative to Audiology. 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide 
November 2017 
Page   2-10 
Additional examples of service dispersion include the location of certain specialty functions 
associated with ASPS within other departments of the Medical Center.  For instance, 
Posturography is often located in PM&R or Polytrauma (in locations that have PRC’s) rather 
than in the Audiology Clinic (refer to Section 2.2.4.1 Posturography Room).  Swallow studies 
and videostroboscopy may be performed in an Endoscopy Procedure Room (also referred to 
as Speech “Lab” at some Medical Centers) located in an outpatient procedure setting, and both 
Audiology and Speech Pathology may have dedicated space in a CLC.   
Note: The terms, “Balance Testing” and “Speech Lab” encompass several diagnostic/treatment functions within Audiology 
and Speech Pathology, respectively; they do not represent individual rooms described later in this Design Guide.
Figure 7: Functional Relationships – Service Proximity 
Figure 7 illustrates three alternative scenarios for the location of Audiology and Speech 
Pathology services; collocated services and functions are preferred.  Refer to Appendix 5.2 for 
examples and discussion of these scenarios for facilities that were visited as part of the 
development of this Design Guide. 
Telehealth Considerations
4.
At VA Medical Centers, teleaudiology and other telehealth services (such as for Speech 
Pathology) may involve consultations/diagnostics, clinical education, or group therapy 
programs.  As such, the VA Medical Center is considered the “hub” location for delivery of 
teleaudiology and Speech-Language Pathology telehealth services.  ASPS Clinics at VAMC’s 
require both individual office/consultation spaces and group rooms/classrooms that are 
specifically planned and equipped to conduct teleaudiology and telehealth.  Refer to key room 
descriptions in 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 for Telehealth and Group Rooms for specific criteria. 
 
Outpatient Setting – Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC)/Ambulatory Care 
2.2.3
Centers (ACC) 
Department Location
1.
The Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic at Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) 
and Ambulatory Care Centers (ACCs) shall be located in close proximity to the main or 
secondary entrance and adjacent to other specialty clinics for potential sharing of 
administrative resources (such as reception), and support space.  Since Audiology and Speech 
Pathology are specialty services, patient care functions are not readily accommodated in multi-

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-11 
function examination/treatment rooms; a dedicated clinic for the service shall be planned.  If 
ASPS is at a large multiple-story Outpatient Clinic or Ambulatory Care/Surgery Center, it may 
be located on a non-entry level, with convenient access to vertical transportation and intuitive 
wayfinding.  ASPS shall never be located immediately adjacent to noisy areas or noise-
generating functions. 
 Department Functional Relationships 
2.
Compatible functional adjacencies with ASPS include PM&R and the Eye Clinic.  If the facility 
has an ambulatory procedure/surgery suite, there may be synergies with ASPS in terms of the 
types of procedures and patients treated.  Fluoroscopic exam of swallow function (also known 
as Modified Barium Swallow (MBS)) is performed in Radiology and is a consideration for 
service proximity between Speech Pathology and Radiology, if these services are authorized at 
the facility.  If endoscopic swallow studies are performed, the process for handling scopes and 
functional relationship to Sterile Processing and other support spaces, such as Clean Supply 
and Soiled Utility/Holding Rooms, needs to be a consideration.  Patient and staff toilets shall be 
located within the clinic. 
Compensation and Pension (Comp & Pen) exams are performed in sound suites located within 
the outpatient Audiology Clinic, or in a separate Comp & Pen facility.  In such circumstances, 
consideration for patient and staff flow and proximity between the two locations shall be 
evaluated during the facility planning phase. 
Access to a Canteen Service, coffee shop, or vending is important for patient, family, and staff 
convenience, but should not be adjacent.   
Key services and departmental relationships between ASPS and other services at CBOCs are 
illustrated in Figure 8.  Also, refer to the Functional Relationship Matrices in PG-18-9 Chapter 
204: Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Services Space Planning Criteria, Section 7.

 Telehealth Considerations 
3.
Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) will typically be utilized as the “spoke” location for teleaudiology 
and other telehealth services (such as Speech Pathology).  Depending on the size of ASPS, a 
dedicated Telehealth Exam Room may be allocated.  This room accommodates the patient and 
telehealth clinical technician (TCT) and is equipped to connect with the remote 
clinician/provider (typically at the associated VAMC) via telemedicine technology.  Refer to key 
room descriptions in section 2.2.4.1 Telehealth Exam Room and Telehealth Room for specific 
room criteria. 
 
Audiology Functional Considerations 
2.2.4
Services performed in Audiology range from routine activities for established patients which 
take from 5 to 20 minutes, such as hearing aid adjustments and cerumen management, to 
complex procedures and treatments, which range from 20 minutes to over an hour, such as 
balance testing (including Vestibulography, Posturography, Sinusoidal Vertical Axis Rotation), 
hearing aid assessments for new patients, and exams to establish benefits eligibility (Comp & 
Pen Exams).  Audiometric exams for new patients average about 60 minutes, while those for 
established patients require between 30 to 45 minutes.  Other patient care activities include 
(VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-17): 
• 
Acoustic Immittance tests (Tympanometry) 
• 
Hearing Aid Fitting/Programming 
• 
Auditory Evoked Potentials (BAEP) 
• 
Otoacoustic Emissions 
• 
Tinnitus Assessment 
• 
Aural Rehabilitation 
• 
ENT Procedures/Services 
Some key considerations for the planning of Audiology services are:

Audiology Rehabilitation/Counseling Room 
The Audiology Rehabilitation/Counseling Room is a patient care space where Audiologists 
perform one-on-one auditory rehabilitation, device demonstrations, and counseling for assistive 
devices, including cochlear implants.  Additional activities include quick fittings demonstrations 
of how to charge programmers, patient documentation, and other administrative work 
functions.  Patient encounters are conducted one-on-one in the room, over the telephone, or 
via telehealth, and average 15 to 20 minutes (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (3), 2016) 
(VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-17).  The patient is 
usually accompanied by a family member.   
Figure 10: Audiology Consultation/Demonstration;  
Source: VA Blogs-Helping Deaf Veterans 
The Rehabilitation/Counseling Room is 
most closely associated with the 
Audiometric Examination Suites 
(“sound suites”) and 
Programming/Fitting rooms.  While the 
tasks described above may be 
performed in the sound suite, it is 
beneficial for booth turnover/efficiency 
to conduct these activities in the 
Rehabilitation/Counseling Room.  Close 
proximity to the sound suites also 
facilitates handwashing, not available in 
the prefabricated booths, and provides 
relief for both patients and staff from the 
sense of confinement that may be 
experienced in the sound booths. 
Locating the Rehabilitation/Counseling Rooms and Programming/Fitting Rooms along a 
perimeter/exterior wall with windows, if available, is beneficial for access to natural daylight 
outside of the sound suites; however, glare from windows must be controlled.  Lighting 
control/adjustability should accommodate a variety of tasks and conditions.  Sound attenuation 
to produce a quiet environment is an additional important consideration for this space.   
The layout of the Rehabilitation/Counseling Room supports consultation and demonstration 
activities, while maintaining safety considerations by locating the service provider close to the 
door (refer to Section 2.3.11 Physical Safety), and providing ample space for maneuvering a 
wheelchair or scooter.  Key room contents include: 
• 
Provider Workstation: desk with sufficient surface area to accommodate paperwork 
functions, space for charging programmers, and standard desktop equipment, including a 
computer workstation with dual monitor setup for telehealth.  The mounting and location of 
monitors on a flexible arm shall permit viewing by both the provider and patient.   
• 
Storage:  space for small devices and paperwork associated with performing services, 
including space for demo items and manuals.  This need may be accommodated with a 
combination of mobile pedestal file and overhead “flipper door” cabinets at the provider 
workstation.   

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide

Page   2-15 
• 
Mobile, adjustable height table for demonstrations, layout of hearing aids, and consultations 
positioned between the Audiologist and patient. 
• 
Small mobile table for assistive device demonstrations and additional teaching. 
• 
Handwash sink; faucet with electronic sensor controls preferred. 
Wire management is addressed via numerous outlet locations above and below the 
workstation and on all sides of the room.  
Refer to the Room Template, Audiology Rehabilitation/Counseling Room (AUD01) in Section 
4.2 and PG-18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room 
contents associated with this room.   
Hearing Aid Repair Room 
Hearing Aid Repair is a patient care room where 
minor hearing aid adjustments and repairs are 
performed and ear impressions are made.  This 
room should be located close to the department 
entry due to frequency of use, for both 
routine/scheduled appointments and walk-in 
patients.  Additional activities may include 
demonstrations, consultations, patient 
documentation (“charting”) and other 
administrative/work functions.  Encounters are 
one-on-one with an average duration of 20 to 30 
minutes.  The patient is usually accompanied by 
a family member.   
Workflow in the room involves documentation of 
the patient’s medical history at a computer 
workstation followed by diagnosis/treatment (ear 
exam, adjust hearing aid, make ear impression, 
etc.).  The patient will be seated in either the 
exam/treatment chair or wheelchair, depending 
upon his/her mobility.  Sufficient space for 
working and movement in either scenario, 
including wheelchair transfer, is accommodated 
in the room layout.  Space for at least one side 
chair for a family member shall be provided. 
The room requires sufficient standing height work/counter space and good overhead and task 
lighting to perform the meticulous tasks associated with making hearing aid repairs and 
adjustments.  Working space and storage for repair supplies, tubing, receivers, wax guards, 
wax loops, brushes, battery cases, and many small parts shall be accommodated either in a 
modular casework system  with countertop, drawers and cabinets, or a combination of 
adjustable height work bench, tool chest, and  storage cabinets (such as utility cabinets, lateral 
files).  Additional countertop equipment includes multi-drawer “bins” for storage of small 
hearing aid parts (refer to Figure 11).

Page   2-16 
The provider computer workstation shall include dual monitors with webcam capability for 
telehealth; a wall hung configuration maximizes floor and working space in the room.  A sink for 
handwashing may be wall hung or incorporated into a modular casework system; electronic 
sensor controls are preferred for the faucet.  Accommodations for disposable waste, including 
biohazard container, are required; a sharps container is optional based on local requirements.   
Hearing aid modifications requiring buffing/grinding activities are performed in the Hearing Aid 
Lab.  The Hearing Aid Lab should be proximate to this room for staff convenience and workflow 
efficiency. 
Refer to the Room Template, Hearing Aid Repair Room (AUD02) in Section 4.3 and PG-18-5 
Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room contents associated 
with this room. 
Audiometric Examination Suites 
The Audiometric Examination Suite 
(alternatively referred to as “sound suite”) 
is the key component room of the 
Audiology Service.  The preferred 
configuration (Suite 1) is a prefabricated 
suite, which typically consists of an 
examination side and a control side with a 
view window between the two sides (see 
Figure 12).  Audiometric Examination 
Suite 2 may be provided as an option to 
accommodate overall facility planning and 
direction.  It consists of a prefabricated 
sound booth inside of a conventional 
construction, sound attenuated room (see 
Figure 13).   While manufacturers offer 
various standard configurations and sizes for prefabricated 
booths, the Audiometric Examination Suite templates in this 
Design Guide are larger to accommodate the unique functional 
requirements and room contents associated with performing 
hearing assessments for Veterans.   
Figure 12: Audiometric Suite 1 Plan 
Figure 13: Audiometric Suite 2 
Plan 
Prefabricated sound suites/booths are used for audiometric 
examinations, acoustic immittance tests, otoacoustics emission 
tests, disability (compensation and pension (C & P)) 
examinations for auditory disorders, and for research activities 
that require a highly controlled acoustic and electromagnetically 
shielded environment.  Hearing aid fitting/ programming may be 
accommodated on the examination side of the suite, allowing for 
greater flexibility in space utilization within the department and 
minimizing the need for patient movement.  An alternative (and 
supplemental) approach is to perform this function in the 
Programming/Fitting Room, which facilitates patient through-put 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-17 
of the sound suites, and provides relief from booth-
related stresses (such as the sense of confinement, 
etc.).  A determination regarding the extent to which 
hearing aid fitting/programming is to be conducted in 
the prefabricated booth shall be made during initial 
facility planning in order to appropriately 
plan/program the department and respective spaces.  
For the purposes of this Design Guide, Suite 1 is 
planned to accommodate this function; Suite 2 may 
accommodate the function based on facility 
direction/operations, but the booth configuration is a 
limiting factor.  
Additional patient care activities in the Audiometric 
Examination Suites include entering case histories 
into the computer, adjusting hearing aids, and 
searching the internet for available products.  The 
control side of the suites shall provide for telehealth 
capability.  Hearing assessments for new patients 
average about 60 minutes, while those for 
established patients range from 30 to 45 minutes.  
The duration of C&P exams, including chart review 
and medical opinion, is typically about 90 minutes. 
Audiometric Examination Suites are 
most closely associated with 
Audiology Rehabilitation/Counseling 
and Programming/Fitting Rooms 
(see Figure 14).  Close proximity 
between these rooms facilitates 
movement of staff and patients 
between the spaces during a single 
appointment.  For instance, the 
testimony portion of a C&P 
encounter is conducted in the 
Rehab/Counseling Room, while the 
hearing assessment and other 
clinical aspects of the appointment 
must be performed inside of the 
booth.  Since plumbing fixtures 
cannot be located in the 
prefabricated sound suites/booths, 
access to handwashing in the 
Rehabilitation/Counseling Room, 
Programming/Fitting Room, or 
another convenient location is also 
an important consideration.

Page   2-18 
Special attention must be given to the privacy, acoustic, and electromagnetic radiation 
environments in which sound suites/booths will be located.  Prefabricated sound suites shall be 
double-wall construction and conform to 1B 11-87 Booth Audiometric Examination 
Specifications which can be found on the ASPS SharePoint (VA Intranet - VHA Handbooks).  
Prefabricated sound suites/booths must conform to ambient noise attenuation according to 
current standards as published by the American National Standards Institute or other standards 
organization.   
The space criteria for both Suites 1 and 2 include maneuvering space for wheelchairs, working 
space around the patient, and minimum door width/clearances (on both the control and exam 
room sides).  At VAMCs, at least one sound suite shall be large enough to accommodate a 
patient bed or gurney on the exam side (refer to Figure 15).  
Considerable advance planning and interdisciplinary/construction trade coordination is required 
for installation of a prefabricated sound suite/booth.  The A/E firm and general contractor shall 
coordinate closely with unique vendor installation requirements.  Specific provisions must be 
made for weight/concentrated load, structural slab depressions/slab preparation, clearances 
between the booth and surrounding construction, air distribution/temperature control, numerous 
power/data outlets, lighting, and fire protection.  
(a) 
Suite 1, Audiometric Examination 
Audiometric  Suite 1 maximizes 
control/shielding of interference from ambient 
noise and electromagnetic sources,  and 
provides sufficient space for all equipment 
associated with the full range of audiologic 
assessment procedures as well as hearing 
aid evaluations, programming, and fitting.  
The recommended configuration of 
Audiometric Examination Suite 1 provides for 
equally sized exam and control sides with 
double wall construction and dual 
inswing/outswings doors on both sides so 
that each side may be used interchangeably.  
Each side is accessed directly from the 
corridor or adjacent common space.   
In prefabricated, double-wall, two-sided 
audiometric suites with inswing/outswing or 
tandem outswing doors, adequate clear 
space adjacent to and in front of the door 
must be considered.  If suites are located 
opposite from one another along a corridor, 
doors must be offset so that they do not block movement/egress in the corridor when 
doors on opposite sides are simultaneously open.  Doors shall not block the clear egress 
width of the corridor, and transitions/thresholds into the prefabricated sound suite must be 
flush with the adjacent finish floor surface (refer to Figure 16).   
Figure 16: Corridor with Sound Suites;  
VAMC Washington, DC 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-19 
The control side of the sound suite 
accommodates a service provider and one or 
two student(s)/trainee(s); the exam side 
accommodates a single patient, family 
member, provider, and trainee.  The patient’s 
position in the booth varies during the 
screening process.  The patient will always face 
away from the view window and be positioned 
either near the window or in the center of the 
booth for some tests.  
Key room contents for the Audiometric 
Examination Suite 1 include various sizes of 
adjustable height tables to accommodate the 
numerous diagnostic testing devices, multiple 
computer workstations, monitors, and system 
components such as speakers.  The control 
side includes dual monitors with webcam 
capability to accommodate telehealth.   
Refer to the Room Template, Suite 1, 
Audiometric Examination (prefab, 2-sided suite) 
(AUDE1) in Section 4.4 and PG-18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout 
and additional room contents associated with this room.   
Figure 17: Sound Suite; 
Orlando VAMC, FL 
(b) 
Suite 2, Audiometric Examination 
Audiometric Examination Suite 2, if provided, offers an alternative that does not require 
prefabricated construction on both the exam and control sides.  The prefabricated booth 
is for examination only, while the service provider conducts tests and records 
observations in the room, outside of the prefabricated enclosure.  C&P exams may be 
performed in Suite 2 if ambient noise from surrounding spaces is mitigated on the control 
side per the room criteria.   
Figure 18: Audiometric Examination;  
Source: VA Blogs - VA offers Full Continuum of Care 
This Audiometric Suite configuration requires access to the prefabricated booth through 
the control room/control side rather than directly from the corridor.  Sufficient clearances 
are to be maintained to 
accommodate wheelchair 
maneuvering space at both the room 
entry and the inswing/outswing doors 
into the booth.  
Transitions/thresholds for doorways 
into the sound booth shall be flush 
with the adjacent finish floor surface.  
The control side accommodates a 
service provider and one 
student/trainee; the booth/exam side 
of the suite accommodates a single 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide

Page   2-20 
patient, family member, and provider.  The patient’s position in the booth varies during 
the screening process.  The patient will always face away from the view window and be 
positioned either near the window or in the center of the booth for some tests.   
Key room contents for the Audiometric Examination Suite 2 include adjustable height 
tables to accommodate the numerous diagnostic testing devices, multiple computer 
workstations, monitors, and system components such as speakers.  The control side 
includes dual monitors with webcam capability to accommodate telehealth.  The control 
side also accommodates modular casework for storage of point-of-use supplies and 
countertop/work surface with a hand wash sink (electronic sensor faucet preferred).   
Refer to the Room Template, Suite 2, Audiometric Examination (single prefab booth in 
room) (AUDE2) in Section 4.5 and PG-18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended 
layout and additional room contents associated with this room. 
Programming/Fitting Room 
This room accommodates the equipment used to 
program and fit digital hearing aids and bioelectric 
implants.  Additional activities include orientation and 
auditory demonstrations, patient consultations, 
documentation, and other administrative work 
functions.   
The Programming/Fitting Room is most closely 
associated with the Audiometric Examination Suites 
(“sound suites”) and Rehabilitation/Counseling 
rooms.  While hearing aid programming/fitting may 
be performed in the sound suite, this room offers 
additional flexibility and efficiency within the 
department, particularly at smaller facilities with a 
limited number of sound suites (VHA ASPS, 
Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 
2016-17).  A separate Programming/Fitting Room 
also accommodates handwashing, not available in 
the prefabricated booths, and provides relief for both 
patients and staff from the sense of confinement 
associated with the sound booths.  It is 
recommended to locate the Programming/Fitting Rooms along a perimeter/exterior wall with 
windows for natural daylight; however, glare from windows must be controlled.  A quiet 
environment and sound attenuation considerations are important for this space.   
The unique equipment associated with this room is the Hearing Aid Analyzer/Real Ear 
Measurement System; this is located on an adjustable height workstation where the patient is 
seated.  Activities associated with this system include initial otoscopic examination, insertion of 
a probe tube into the patient’s ear, and conducting a real ear measurement with the device 
(John Pumford, 2001).  Patient positioning relative to speakers that are components of the 
system is an important consideration for accurate measurements.  Hearing aids may also be 
tested using this system without the patient being present.

Page   2-21 
Additional room contents include a separate provider workstation with sufficient surface area to 
accommodate paperwork functions, programmers being charged, and computer workstation, 
including dual monitors with webcam capability for telehealth.  Cabinet space for storage of 
demonstration items, amplified phones, and brochures is needed; a countertop/work surface 
accommodates a small storage container for hearing aid parts and hand wash sink (electronic 
sensor faucet preferred).  A wall-mounted mirror facilitates hearing aid demonstrations and a 
desktop video magnifier located on a mobile cart, is used to assist visually impaired patients.  
Wire management is a significant consideration for this room. 
Refer to the Room Template, Programming/Fitting Room (AUD03) in Section 4.6 and PG-18-5, 
Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room contents associated 
with this room. 
Cerumen Management Room 
The Cerumen Management Room is a patient care space where the primary function is to 
perform ear irrigations and ear wax removal.  Additional activities may include triage of walk-in 
patients, consultations, patient documentation (“charting”), and other administrative/work 
functions.  It is best located close to the department entry due to frequency of use, for both 
routine/scheduled appointments and walk-in patients.  This function is most closely associated 
with the ENT service at a VA Medical Center; emergency/urgent care treatments (such as 
removal of foreign objects from the ear) may also be performed in this room.  Encounters are 
one-on-one with an average duration of 10 to 20 minutes.  The patient is usually accompanied 
by a family member.  
This patient care space accommodates the preferred diagnostic and treatment equipment 
required for cerumen management, including an ENT console diagnostic microscope, and 
video otoscope.  Workflow in the room involves 
documentation of the patient’s medical history at a 
computer workstation, followed by diagnosis and 
treatment while the patient is seated in either the 
exam/treatment chair or wheelchair, depending 
upon his/her mobility.  Sufficient space for working 
and movement in either scenario, including space 
for wheelchair transfer, is accommodated in the 
room layout.  Space for at least one side chair for a 
family member shall be provided. 
Figure 20: Cerumen Management Room; 
VAMC Washington, DC 
Enclosed cabinet space is required for storage of 
many single use items, including bottles and paper 
products, such as absorbent pads to capture 
moisture.  A sink for handwashing may be wall hung 
or incorporated into modular casework; electronic 
sensor controls are preferred for the faucet. 
The provider computer workstation shall include 
dual monitors with webcam capability for telehealth; 
a wall hung configuration maximizes floor and 
working space in the room.  The video otoscope

requires consideration for placement relative to the display monitor and computer.  
Accommodations for disposable waste, including biohazard and sharps container, are required. 
Refer to the Room Template, ""
 in Section 4.7 and PG-
18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room contents 
associated with this room. 
Electrophysiology Room 
This room accommodates the equipment utilized in 
measuring auditory evoked potentials, such as 
brainstem auditory evoked potentials (ABR) or 
electrocochleography (ECOG) for diagnostic 
purposes.  This room is most closely associated with 
balance testing functions, including Posturography, 
Vestibulography, and Rotary Chair.  While this 
function may be performed in multiple locations via a 
mobile system (on an equipment cart), if a dedicated 
room is authorized at the facility, it should be located 
in a relatively quiet area with limited traffic.  The 
timeframes involved with ABR and ECOG are 
approximately 30 to 60 minutes, respectively.  
Alternate locations for the function are in a sound 
suite or Audiology Rehabilitation/Counseling Room 
equipped to accommodate the tests.  
The Electrophysiology Room shall be planned as a 
diagnostic/treatment room which minimizes noise 
transmission from adjacent spaces, and incorporates 
controlled lighting with dimmable fixtures.  The type 
of patient chair will differ based on local 
requirements  (VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User 
Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-17).  For instance, a side chair with arms is sufficient for 
otoneurological screening, which does not require a lot of time, but a chair that reclines or an 
exam table may be preferred for longer tests (e.g. middle, late potentials and threshold 
searches (Crumley, 2013)).   
Additional room contents include modular casework for storage of a small quantity of supplies, 
countertop/work surface with hand wash sink (electronic sensor faucet preferred), and provider 
computer workstation with dual monitors and webcam capability for telehealth; a wall hung 
configuration maximizes floor and working space in the room.  The testing equipment, which is 
laptop based, will be located on a mobile computer/equipment cart. 
Adequate space for working and movement around the patient exam chair is required, 
including space for wheelchair or scooter access.  Space for at least one side chair for a family 
member shall be provided. 
Refer to Room Template, Electrophysiology Room (AUDP1) in Section 4.8 and PG-18-5,

Balance Testing 
Assessment and treatment of balance disorders is a specialty subset of Audiology, and may 
account for a large number of referrals to those medical centers and clinics that offer the 
services.  Depending on clinical need and provider competencies, these diagnostic/treatment 
services may include some or all of the following:  
•
Computerized Dynamic Posturography
•
Sinusoidal Axial Rotational Test (Rotary Chair)
•
Videonystagmography (VNG)
•
BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) treatments
Videonystagmography (VNG) is the minimum test required to assess balance issues in 
patients.  VNG along with the Rotary Chair are the most common balance diagnostics 
/treatments in Audiology clinics.  Posturography, on the other hand, is more closely associated 
with Physical Therapy (VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-
17), and therefore may be located elsewhere in a facility, such as with Physical Medicine and 
Rehab, Community Living Center, or Polytrauma.  Each subtest lasts about 20 minutes; the 
duration for a full series of tests is about two hours (VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User 
Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-17).

Figure 22: Balance Testing Area (or Suite) 
with Posturography 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide

Page   2-24 
Balance testing rooms are best collocated in a quiet area of the Audiology Clinic with limited 
traffic; a patient toilet room shall be located as part of the grouping or nearby.  Diagnostics and 
treatments may be performed in a single large room to minimize the requirement for patient 
movement while they may be disoriented and dizzy; for instance, the VNG system and Rotary 
Chair are most commonly collocated.  Alternatively, rooms may be planned for individual 
functions to minimize the amount of time a room is occupied.  For the purpose of the ASPS 
Design Guide, separate room templates have been developed for Vestibulography (VNG), 
Rotary Chair, and Posturography Rooms.  Refer to Figure 22 and Figure 23 for alternative 
functional relationships with and without Posturography Room.  
Finishes and furnishings in Balance Testing Rooms should consider stress reduction strategies 
(environment of care), sound attenuation, cleanability/infection control, and minimizing clutter.  
Strategies for helping patients regain equilibrium following each test may include lighting 
control, size of the treatment table (extra width allows patient to adjust position for personal 
comfort), and a soothing color palette. 
Individual Balance Testing Rooms are described below. 
(a) 
Posturography Room 
Posturography accommodates the equipment 
used to evaluate balance disorders utilizing a 
moving platform device to quantify a patient’s 
ability to maintain balance under varying 
conditions when cues for vision, 
proprioception, and vestibular function are 
manipulated in both static and dynamic 
conditions.   
The primary equipment associated with the 
room is the computerized dynamic 
posturography booth (“tilt booth”) and 
computer/software system/control devices on 
a separate mobile cart.  During testing, the 
patient is positioned and harnessed in a 
standing position, on the moving platform, 
facing the back of the booth, which houses a 
monitor.  Small movements made by the 
patient are measured while the booth and/or 
floor platform is slowly tilted backwards and 
forwards to help isolate the source of balance 
disorder.  The platform is contained in an 
enclosure which can also be used to generate
apparent visual surround motions.  
 
Figure 24: Computerized Dynamic 
Posturography System; C.W. Bill Young VAMC, 
Bay Pines, FL 
Additional room contents include modular casework for storage of a small quantity of 
supplies, countertop/work surface with hand wash sink (electronic sensor faucet 
preferred), and provider computer workstation with dual monitors and webcam capability 
for telehealth; a wall hung configuration maximizes floor and working space in the room.

The room shall also accommodate at least one side chair for a family member and/or 
resident/trainee.  Although conventional best practice related to the room and fixture 
accessibility shall be maintained (ABA/ADA), accommodations for wheelchair-bound 
patients are not required for this room since the test requires the patient to be in an 
upright position. 
Alternate locations for this function/room are Rehab Medicine (PM&R) and Polytrauma 
(limited to facilities with a PRC).  In instances where the function is located elsewhere, 
proximity to the Audiology Clinic is recommended for both patient and staff convenience. 
Refer to the Room Template, Posturography Room (AUDP2) in Section 4.9 and PG-18-5, 
Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room contents 
associated with this room. 
(b) 
Vestibulography Room 
This room provides visual and vestibular 
systems testing to determine if the vestibular 
(inner ear) or neurological system is the cause 
of a balance disorder.  The room 
accommodates the equipment utilized in 
performing videonystagmography (VNG) and 
BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) 
treatments.  VNG measures eye movement 
during each of three tests (VHA ASPS, 
Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field 
Surveys, 2016-17):  
• 
Ocular Motor Test 
• 
Positional Test (“Dix Hall”) 
• 
Caloric Test 
Figure 25: Vestibulography Room; 
Orlando VAMC, FL 
During the tests, the patient’s orientation is 
varied from lying down to a seated position; 
positioning the patient’s head at specified 
angles (such as 30 degrees) is a consideration 
for selection of the exam/treatment table.   
Caloric testing involves stimulation of motion 
sensors in the inner ear using either air or water irrigators to elicit dizziness.  For water 
caloric irrigators, direct connection to a sink is required; the source and flow depend on 
local and national infection control protocols.  For instance, bottled distilled water may be 
supplied by Sterile Processing and manual control of water flow may be required; water 
temperature is controlled by the irrigator.  The Ocular Motor Test requires the patient to 
follow dots on a screen; the screen may be wall mounted, but floor mounted equipment 
provides flexibility in positioning.   
The layout of Vestibulography provides for a wide treatment table which accommodates 
flexible positioning of the patient, facilitates transfer from a wheelchair, and supports 
patient recovery from the tests (such as from nausea or dizziness).  Additional space is 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-26 
needed for the VNG system and its various components, including control equipment 
which must reach the patient’s head.  A modular casework system with countertop and 
sink, base and wall cabinets, accommodates workspace and storage of supplies needed 
for the tests. 
Adequate space for working and movement around the procedure table is required, 
including space for wheelchair or scooter access.  The provider computer workstation 
shall include dual monitors with webcam capability for telehealth; a wall hung 
configuration maximizes floor and working space in the room.  Space for at least one side 
chair for a family member is recommended. 
Refer to the Room Template, Vestibulography Room (AUDP3) in Section 4.10 and PG-
18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room contents 
associated with this room.  
(c) 
Rotary Chair Room 
This room accommodates the equipment 
utilized in performing vertical axis rotational 
tests for patients with vestibular disorders.  
The primary equipment associated with the 
room is the Rotary Chair booth which, 
depending on vendor, may be either a circular 
or hexagonal configuration.  The booth is a 
fully enclosed dark/black chamber with an 
integral rotational chair inside.  During testing, 
the patient is harnessed in the chair while 
continuous communication between the 
provider and patient is conducted via an 
infrared camera, and a 2-way communication 
system.  The test typically lasts between 20 to 
60 minutes (U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs (3), 2016) (U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (4), 2016).   
Figure 26: Rotary Chair; C.W. Bill Young VAMC, 
Bay Pines, FL 
Additional components associated with the 
Rotary Chair System include an electrical 
console located immediately close to the 
booth and control console/workstation located 
on a desk nearby; an emergency shut off switch is also located close to the booth.  An 
isolation transformer is to be located in a separate facility Electrical Closet.  The A/E and 
general contractor shall coordinate closely with unique vendor installation requirements; 
there are specific requirements for room layout and maximum distances between 
component parts.   
Additional space must be planned for patient movement and access into the booth.  
Although the Rotary Chair cannot accommodate wheelchair-bound or bariatric patients, 
adequate space for maneuvering a wheelchair or scooter to the booth entrance shall be 
provided.  Depending on the shape of the booth, space for housekeeping around the

perimeter is also a consideration.  Additional room contents include modular casework for 
storage of a small quantity of supplies, countertop/work surface with hand wash sink 
(faucet with electronic sensor controls preferred), and at least one side chair for family 
member and/or trainee. 
Refer to the Room Template, Rotary Chair Room (AUDP4) in Section 4.11 and PG-18-5, 
Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room contents 
associated with this room. 
Cochlear Implant Mapping/Fitting Room 
This room accommodates devices and equipment 
that are used to train patients who have recently 
received cochlear implants and are learning to hear 
for the first time with their implant.  This room is also 
used for follow up mapping and adjustments.  While 
this function is limited to VA Medical Centers or 
associated facilities where Cochlear Implants are 
performed, the room description and template are 
provided for planning guidance due to the specialty 
nature of functions and devices.  
The layout of the Cochlear Implant Mapping/Fitting 
Room supports consultation and demonstration 
activities, while maintaining safety considerations by 
locating the service provider close to the door (refer 
to Section 2.3.11 Physical Safety), and providing 
ample space for the movement of a wheelchair or 
scooter.  Key room contents include:   
• 
Provider Workstation: desk with sufficient 
surface area to accommodate paperwork 
functions, space for charging programmers, and 
standard desktop equipment, including a 
computer workstation with dual monitor setup for telehealth.  The mounting and location of 
monitors on a flexible arm shall permit viewing by both the provider and patient.   
• 
Storage:  space for small devices and paperwork associated with performing services, 
including space for demo items and manuals.  This need may be accommodated in a 
combination of mobile pedestal file and “flipper door” cabinets at the provider workstation.   
• 
A mobile, adjustable height table for demonstrations, layout of hearing aids, and 
consultations positioned between the Audiologist and patient. 
• 
A second adjustable height table where assistive listening devices are displayed for patient 
training and demonstrations. 
• 
Video conferencing system. 
• 
Handwash sink; faucet with electronic sensor controls preferred.

Telehealth Exam Room and Telehealth Room 
The type of Telehealth room to be provided depends on whether it is located at a Medical 
Center or Outpatient Clinic/CBOC.  If the room is at a CBOC, it will be developed as a 
Telehealth Exam Room (EXTH1) per current VA space criteria.  Providing access to audiology 
services, including consultation 
with an Audiologist at remote 
sites via teleconferencing 
technology, this room 
accommodates a patient and a 
telehealth technician (refer to 
Figure 28).  This room should be 
near other patient care 
spaces/exam rooms for patient 
convenience; however, noise 
transmission from adjacent 
spaces must be considered.   
Figure 28: Telehealth Exam Room;  
Source: VA Blogs-Telemedicine 
At a Medical Center the “hub” 
location is a clinician space based 
upon the remote “Clinician’s Consultation Room”, per the Telemedicine Room Design Program 
Guide (California Telemedicine and eHealth Center, 2011) and current VA space criteria for 
Telehealth Room (WKTM2).  Since this room is not a direct patient care space, an exam table 
is not required.  This room will be a shared space which may be used for both teleaudiology 
and Speech Pathology telehealth appointments.  The Telehealth Room shall be located in a 
quiet area with limited traffic, close to the Staff and Administrative Functional Area.  Windows 
should be avoided, especially behind the subject because the light may wash out the video 
image or create extreme shadows.   
Planning for both scenarios must consider 
camera/equipment placement relative to background 
(windows, doors, etc.) in order to avoid distractions and 
to establish optimal viewing angles and lighting 
conditions.  The variety of telemedicine solutions has 
diverse infrastructure requirements; the impact includes 
room size, flooring, wall color, lighting, power, data, and 
conduit pathways.  Refer to additional details discussed 
in Section 2.3 Technical Considerations. 
Hearing Aid Lab 
Figure 29: Hearing Aid Lab; 
Orlando VAMC, FL 
The Hearing Aid Lab is an Audiology Support Area 
space which accommodates the equipment used to 
modify custom hearing aids and ear molds; the room 
also incorporates storage for parts and supplies.  Since 
the equipment in this room is shared by all Audiologists 
and Audiology Technicians, it should be convenient to 
the Audiology Clinic Patient Area.  Due to noisy 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-29 
equipment such as the buffer/grinder, the room should not be located immediately adjacent to 
spaces requiring special sound attenuation such as Audiometric Exam Suites and 
Programming/Fitting Room.  
The Hearing Aid Lab is a workroom which requires sufficient standing height counter space for 
equipment, working space, and a sink.  The size of the room depends on the number of FTE’s 
anticipated; the room template is based upon accommodating at least two people working 
simultaneously.  Significant equipment in the room includes:  
• 
Buffer/grinder/polishing workstation: the room template accommodates two self-contained 
workstations that incorporate dust collection.  Countertop alternatives are available (as 
illustrated in Figure 29).  
• 
Hearing Aid Vacuum Cleaner: this is a countertop vacuum/suction device which removes 
debris from hearing aids. 
Storage for spare parts, tools, and supplies may be accommodated using a modular casework 
system or adjustable height workbench setup to maintain flexibility and adaptability.  A 
combination of enclosed drawers and cabinets is necessary to support the storage needs.  
Additional countertop equipment includes multi-drawer “bins” for storage of small hearing aid 
parts and magnifier task light. 
Sufficient general overhead and task lighting is required to perform meticulous tasks; numerous 
electrical outlets are required to plug in equipment.  Additional considerations include 
provisions for adequate room exhaust due to the buffer/grinder, depending on the model 
purchased (self-contained, or countertop).  Dust generated by the buffer/grinder may also 
cause slippery floors.   
Refer to the Room Template, Hearing Aid Lab 
(AUDS1) in Section 4.17 and PG-18-5, Equipment 
Guide List for the recommended layout and 
additional room contents associated with this room.   
Hearing Aid Processing Room 
The Hearing Aid Processing Room is an Audiology 
Support Area space which accommodates activities 
associated with shipping and receiving hearing aids 
and hearing aid parts.  Due to patient privacy 
considerations and the high cost of devices, the 
room shall be locked at all times.  The room should 
be in a location convenient for ASPS staff, and 
adjacent to, or near the Copy/Mail Distribution 
Room, if possible. 
Figure 30: Hearing Aid Processing;  
Washington, DC VAMC 
The size of the room will depend on the number of 
providers.  A separate open shelving unit is 
assigned to each provider for temporary storage of 
the boxes labeled with individual patient 
information.  A single patient may have up to five 
boxes of devices and parts.  A wall-mounted, 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-30 
adjustable height computer workstation with counter (for layout and packaging functions) and 
cabinet space (for shipping boxes, paper, supplies), will accommodate the work/storage needs 
and occasional use by an FTE during each day.  A multi-function printer/copier may also be 
located in this room.   
Refer to the Room Template, Hearing Aid Processing Room (AUDS2) in Section 4.18 and PG-
18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room contents 
associated with this room.   
Additional Audiology Support Area Spaces 
The Audiology Clinic requires access to additional support functions, including a Clean Supply, 
Soiled Holding, and Equipment Storage Rooms.  If the service is small, some of these rooms 
may be shared with Speech Pathology; however, there are special requirements for these 
rooms if they also need to accommodate Speech Pathology activities (refer to discussion in 
Soiled Utility Room, Clean Supply Room, and Equipment Storage Room).  
 Workflow and Functional Relationships 
2.
The Audiology Clinic Patient and Support Area spaces may be organized in a variety of ways 
depending on the size of the program and available space.  For locations with comprehensive 
services, zoning the patient care spaces in a way that corresponds to the type of treatment 
activity and level of complexity is suggested.  Refer to Figure 9 which illustrates the functional 
relationships between key Audiology spaces, as well as patient/work flow between them.  Refer 
to Section 3.0 Functional Diagrams for additional recommendations and discussion. 
 Functional Requirements 
3.
Significant forethought and technical coordination is required to plan for the space associated 
with Audiology functions.  Refer to Section 2.3 Technical Considerations and Section 4.0 Room 
Templates for detailed technical criteria.  Some key considerations include: 
• 
Wayfinding to the Service incorporating both intuitive visual cues and clear, visible, barrier-
free signage.  
• 
Sufficient, waiting and seating, immediately adjacent to the clinic, configured so that the 
receptionists have direct visualization of patients and family members; a linear layout is 
preferred since patients are hearing impaired and may have other disabilities as well.  
Noise mitigation, a calming environment, connection to daylight/natural light, and proximity 
to toilet rooms and vending are also important considerations.  The size of the waiting area 
shall allow for a certain percentage of walk-in patients and have sufficient maneuvering 
space for movement of wheelchairs and scooters.   
• 
Patient Toilet(s) shall be located in the Audiology Clinic Patient Area. 
• 
Staff support functions, such as a Staff Toilet, Staff Lounge, and Conference Room may be 
shared with Speech Pathology, but are to be located within the department.  If ASPS is 
small, the Staff Lounge may be shared with an adjacent clinic or service.  
• 
Planning for accessibility/barrier-free design is very important due to patients’ disabilities.  
Wheelchairs and scooters must be accommodated in both public areas and corridor areas, 
as well as in the patient care rooms.  Wide door widths, smooth transitions (avoid 
thresholds); flooring materials which facilitate movement, mounting heights of devices, and 
assistive devices such as handrails, grab bars, and adjustable height furnishings are all 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-31 
considerations.  Assistive technologies, 
such as CCTV, LOOP and 
iseewhatyousay have direct application 
for Audiology patients, and may be 
considered for supplementing standard 
barrier-free design at these facilities 
(Kickstarter)  (Myers, A Technological 
godsend to Counter Hearing Loss, 
2015) (Getting hard of hearing people 
"in the loop") (Myers, Hearing Aids Can 
Serve a Second Purpose as Wireless Speakers, 2013).  Barrier-free considerations shall 
extend to staff spaces as well.  Refer to ADA/ABA and the VA Barrier-Free Design 
Standard (PG-18-13) for additional information (assistive technologies are only required in 
high occupancy public spaces; however, may be considered for the public spaces of ASPS 
due to the patient demographics).   
• 
At VA Medical Centers, space for movement of gurneys/stretchers and patient beds is 
required within the Audiology clinic.  Some rooms must also be able to accommodate a 
stretcher or bed.  Refer to specific room descriptions and space criteria. 
• 
Sound attenuation and noise mitigation is a significant component of design for these 
facilities.  Audiometric examinations can have no background noise; hearing assessments 
for Comp and Pen have specific criteria and must be performed in Audiometric Sound 
Suites to meet the requirements.  Refer to Section 2.3 Technical Considerations for 
additional discussion and Section 4.0 Room Templates for acoustical and noise criteria for 
key rooms.  
• 
Finishes must balance infection control with sound attenuation requirements. 
• 
Lighting is an important factor for the functional areas of Audiology.  Many spaces require a 
high level of task lighting to perform detailed/meticulous tasks; other spaces need lighting 
control and dimming capabilities.  Appropriately designed lighting throughout helps reduce 
patient and caregiver stress. 
• 
Wire management and provision for adequate electrical devices is extremely important.  
Many rooms, particularly those where hearing exams and programming/fitting activities 
occur have many devices requiring an ample number of receptacles.  
• 
Significant interdisciplinary and construction trade coordination is required for the 
installation of a prefabricated audiometric exam suite or booth.  Refer to the Audiometric 
Examination Suite discussion, specific requirements addressed in Technical 
Considerations 2.3, and Room Templates/Room Data Sheets for Audiometric Examination 
Suite 1 (Section 4.4) and Audiometric Examination Suite 2 (Section 4.5).   
Figure 31: Assistive Technologies:

Speech-Language Pathology Functional Considerations 
2.2.5
Speech-Language Pathology services include a broad range of evaluations and treatments for 
individuals with communication and swallowing disorders.  Services are provided for inpatients 
and outpatients, and rooms should accommodate access for wheelchairs, motorized 
wheelchairs, and small stretchers.  Most standardized tests and specialized diagnostic 
procedures average 60 to 90 minutes.  Individual treatment/therapy sessions are scheduled for 
45 to 60 minutes and may be offered in person or via telehealth technology (U.S. Department 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-32 
of Veterans Affairs (7), 2016) (VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 
2016-17).  Treatment and education may also be provided in a group setting with 3 to 5 
patients at a time. 
Due to the complexity of procedures, provider competencies, equipment needs, and inpatient 
case mix, the Speech-Language Pathology services have historically been located at a VA 
Medical Center and are best collocated with the Audiology Service.  Speech-Language 
Pathology services may be provided at Outpatient Clinics (OPC or CBOC) and space may be 
allocated based upon the number of full-time or part-time clinicians, specialized procedures 
offered, and anticipated workload and growth. 
Specialized procedures to evaluate voice and swallow function include endoscopic 
examinations and warrant special considerations for mobile carts, storage, and cleaning of 
flexible and rigid endoscopes following RME policies and procedures.  With ever expanding 
technology to assist individuals with disabilities, space and storage should be allocated for 
evaluation and treatment for a variety of assistive technology and prosthetic devices (including 
tablets, smart phones, computerized speech devices, cognitive aids, and voice prosthetic 
devices). 
Special procedures performed in the clinic that require specific equipment and consideration for 
cleaning or reprocessing include: 
• 
Laryngoscopy including rigid and flexible endoscopic examination of vocal cord function 
Fiberoptic Endoscopic Examination of Swallow function/safety (FEES)  
• 
Evaluation and fitting of voice prostheses  
• 
Evaluation and treatment of tracheostomy speaking valves 
Patient care activities that do not involve instrumental evaluation and treatment include: 
• 
Evaluation and treatment of language disorders  
• 
Evaluation and treatment of cognitive disorders 
A summary of Speech-Language Pathology services and associated spaces for evaluation or 
treatment is listed in Table 2.  Refer to Paragraph 2.2.41, Functional Areas/Key Rooms for 
detailed descriptions of key rooms.

 Functional Areas/Key Rooms (FA-3 and FA-4) 
1.
The number and type of Speech Pathology rooms is determined by the range of services 
provided by the speech-language pathologist(s) at the facility, the variety of equipment 
purchased, and the workload anticipated.  Clinical support functions, including a Soiled Utility 
Room, close proximity to a Clean Supply Room, and Equipment Storage Room are essential 
components of this service.  Other standard clinical support and administrative functions, 
including Patient and Staff Toilet Rooms, Staff Lounge, Conference and Group Room, 
Reception/Waiting, and administrative offices may be shared with Audiology when the services 
are collocated.  Although Speech-Language Pathology functions occupy a smaller footprint 
than Audiology, if services are separated, essential support, and administrative space must be 
incorporated in order for Speech Pathology to operate as an independent clinic.  For instance, 
reception/waiting areas should be directly adjacent to clinical areas of the service.  Speech 
Pathology Clinic Patient and Support Area spaces (FA-3 and FA-4) are individually described 
in this section; the functional relationship between key rooms is illustrated in Figure 40. 
Office/Treatment Room 
Figure 32: Speech/Office Treatment Room;  
Source- VA Speech-Language Pathology Fact Sheet (U.S. 
Deptartment of Veterans Affairs (8), 2017) 
The Speech Pathology Office/Treatment 
Room is a patient care space that will be 
utilized for the evaluation and treatment 
of communication disorders that do not 
require instrumental evaluation.  
Activities include private counseling and 
speech therapy for patients who have 
language, cognitive and fluency 
disorders, as well as review of medical 
records and documentation.  Routine 
speech-therapy sessions utilize standard 
desktop computer equipment (with 
specialized software) and face-to-face 
coaching/therapy exercises between the 
provider and patient.  Patient encounters 
are conducted one-on-one in the room or 
via telehealth technology.  Speech-language pathologists are more likely to conduct telehealth 
appointments from the Office/Treatment Room rather than using a separate space (VHA 
ASPS, Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-17).  A family 
member/caregiver may accompany the patient during the appointment.   
The recommended location of the Office/Treatment Room is adjacent to other Speech 
Pathology patient care spaces, including the Voice Treatment, Special Procedure, and 
Assistive Technology Rooms; it may be collocated with Audiology Rehabilitation/Counseling 
Rooms, if proximity to the Speech Pathology specialty rooms is maintained.  Additional 
considerations for location include the need to maintain speech privacy; in this case, sound 
should not transmit to the corridor or adjacent spaces.  It is recommended to locate the 
Office/Treatment Rooms along a perimeter/exterior wall with windows for natural daylight, if 
available, but privacy must be maintained and glare/sunlight controlled. 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-34 
The Office/Treatment Room contents include a provider workstation with sufficient surface area 
and storage space for small speech therapy devices, standard desktop office equipment, and 
manuals.  A mobile, adjustable height table is provided for consultations between the Speech 
Pathologist and patient.  There should be sufficient space to accommodate wheelchair and 
scooter access. 
Refer to Room Template, Office/Treatment Room, Speech-Language Pathology (SPL01) in 
Section 4.13 and PG-18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional 
room contents associated with this room.   
Voice Treatment Room 
Figure 33: Speech Pathology, Office/Speech 
Lab; Orlando VAMC, FL 
The Voice Treatment Room is a patient care space 
that will be utilized for the diagnosis and treatment of 
speech and voice disorders, including interventions for 
individuals before and after head and neck cancers.  
This room accommodates special equipment to 
measure and analyze the acoustic properties of 
speech and voice, including alaryngeal 
communication, for the purpose of diagnostic 
evaluation and treatment. 
Procedures performed in this room include prosthetic 
speech devices fittings/changes and repairs including: 
• 
Tracheoesophageal puncture voice prosthesis 
(TEP) fittings/changes and repairs 
• 
Heat/moisture exchanger system (HME) 
fittings/changes and repairs   
Patient encounters range from about thirty minutes (for 
instrumental voice evaluations) (U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (2), 2016) to over two hours (for 
prosthetic device evaluations) (U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (7), 2016).  Encounters are one-on-one between the speech-language 
pathologist and patient, who may be accompanied by a family member/caregiver.  One to two 
students/residents may also be present to observe and/or train in techniques, procedures, and 
equipment use.   
The size and layout of the room shall be zoned to facilitate workflow and differentiate the 
patient evaluation and treatment area from staff work and clinical support functions (refer to 
Figure 34).  The patient treatment zone includes an “ENT” exam/treatment chair, space for 
mobile carts and instruments related to treatment functions, an adjustable height table to 
accommodate the speech analysis computer equipment (including the Phonatory Aerodynamic 
System (PAS)), and space for family/caregiver seating.  A sink for handwashing in the 
treatment zone may be wall hung or incorporated into modular casework; electronic sensor 
controls are preferred for the faucet.  A ceiling mounted exam light in this zone is preferred to 
supplement general lighting in the room.  Accommodations for disposable waste, including 
biohazard and sharps container are required near the treatment zone.   

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-35 
Figure 34: Voice Treatment Room Workflow 
Diagram 
Adequate space for working and movement around the ENT chair is required, including space 
for wheelchair or scooter transfer.  Since the treatment chair is heavy and not easily moved, it 
is critical to coordinate its physical placement relative to other fixed elements in the room.  
Refer to the Room Template, Voice Treatment Room (SPP01) in Section 4.15 for the 
recommended clearances.   
The clinical support/staff zone of the Voice Treatment Room accommodates a provider 
workstation, working counter space and storage for a significant quantity of specialty items.  A 
secondary door in this zone, with direct adjacency to a service corridor and providing 
convenient access to all support/off-stage functions is recommended to facilitate the movement 
of supplies and equipment.   
The provider workstation supports routine patient 
documentation and communication activities 
associated with services performed in the room; it 
incorporates desk space, storage for literature and 
manuals, and computer workstation, with dual 
monitor and webcam for telehealth capability.  
Storage needs are accommodated with a 
combination of mobile carts and modular casework 
system, including working counter space needed 
for preparation of food/liquids, layout of devices, 
and other activities related to care delivery.   
Supplies and devices to be stored include: 
• 
Gauze, tongue depressors, facial tissues 
• 
Small bottles/tubes 
• 
Wipes/cavi and Clorox 
• 
Hemostats and suture removal kits 
• 
Catheters 
• 
Cups 
• 
Small supply of food/liquid items for testing 
oral intake (sealed and dated packages) 
• 
Supplies to attach to equipment, including 
sEMG electrodes, nasal cannulas 
• 
Inspiratory/expiratory devices to issue 
• 
Many small boxes (TEP supplies, dilators, 
HME, adhesive)   
• 
Stoma covers (foam, cloth, crochet) 
• 
Storage for trial electrolarynx (Cooper Rand, Servox, Romet) 
• 
Speaking valves 
Storage of these items is to be accommodated both in the Voice Treatment Room and a 
shared or dedicated Clean Supply Room in close proximity; medical devices and instruments 
may alternatively be stored in a shared Equipment Storage Room.  Point-of-use items may be 
contained in the general storage cart in the treatment zone.  Larger mobile storage carts 
located in the staff zone facilitate “refills” from a bulk supply of stock items stored elsewhere.  

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide

Page   2-36 
Storage of packaged items needs to be in a temperature and humidity controlled environment 
and contained in enclosed cabinets; cabinets do not require locks.   
Refer to the Room Template, Voice Treatment Room (SPP01) in Section 4.15 and PG-18-5, 
Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional room contents associated 
with this room.   
Special Procedure Room 
Figure 35: Endoscopy Procedure Room;  
J.A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital, Tampa, FL 
The Speech Pathology Special Procedure Room 
accommodates the equipment used for instrumental 
evaluation and treatment of voice and swallowing 
disorders as follows: 
• 
Voice 
Diagnostic laryngeal endoscopy involves the 
careful evaluation of both the anatomic and 
physiologic aspects of the nasopharynx/velum, 
pharynx, base of tongue, and larynx.  Vocal folds 
are visualized and examined using high 
magnification, video recording, and stroboscopy 
techniques.   
• 
Swallow function (Dysphagia) 
Evaluation includes one or more instrumental 
procedures, including fiberoptic endoscopic 
examination (FEES) as the patient swallows food 
and liquid, surface EMG (sEMG), tongue 
pressures, respiration, and manometry.   
Patient encounters range from about thirty minutes (for basic screening and endoscopic 
exams) to over one hour (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (7), 2016).  Encounters are one-
on-one between the speech-language pathologist and patient, who may be accompanied by a 
family member/caregiver.  One to two students/residents may also be present to observe 
and/or train in techniques, procedures, and equipment use.   
The size and layout of the room shall be zoned to facilitate workflow and differentiate the 
patient evaluation and treatment area from staff work and clinical support functions.  Equipment 
for voice and swallow evaluations is typically placed on mobile carts to allow for clinical and 
bedside evaluations (at VA Medical Centers).  The room requires sufficient space to 
accommodate the procedure carts, consideration for cleaning, and storage of supplies and 
scopes.   
(a) 
Patient Procedure/Treatment Zone  
The patient treatment zone shall have adequate space for the mobile equipment carts 
(digital swallowing workstation, stroboscopy cart), an “ENT” exam/procedure chair, and 
space for family/caregiver seating.  The videostroboscopy cart and digital swallowing 
workstation are typically positioned adjacent to the procedure chair, on one or both sides.  
Adequate space for working and movement around the patient exam chair is required, 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-37 
including space for wheelchair or scooter transfer.  Since the treatment chair is heavy and 
not easily moved, it is critical to coordinate its physical placement relative to other fixed 
elements in the room.  Refer to the Room Template, Special Procedure Room, Speech 
Pathology (SPP02) in section 4.16 for the recommended clearances.  A ceiling mounted 
exam light located above the treatment chair is preferred to supplement general lighting 
in the room.   
A sink for handwashing may be wall hung or incorporated into modular casework; 
electronic sensor controls are preferred for the faucet.  Accommodations for disposable 
waste, including biohazard and sharps container are required near the treatment zone. 
(b) 
Caregiver/Clinical Support Zone 
Figure 36: Special Procedure Room Workflow 
Diagram 
The recommended layout and location of 
staff and clinical support components in the 
procedure room facilitates a lean workflow, 
and process continuity relative to caregiver 
activities, supplies, and instruments.  A 
secondary door in the staff zone, with direct 
adjacency to a service corridor and providing 
convenient access to all support/off-stage 
functions facilitates the movement of 
supplies, equipment, and soiled instruments.  
A critical function in the staff zone involves 
protocols associated with handling soiled 
scopes (RMEs), which are to be pre-treated 
using an enzymatic solution immediately 
following use, either at the point of care or 
Soiled Utility Room (U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (9), 2016) (VHA ASPS, 
Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field 
Surveys, 2016-17).  The Room Template in 
this Design Guide accommodates this activity 
in the clinical support zone of the room with a 
sink and work area separate from the 
handwashing sink.  After soiled RME is pre-
treated over the sink, it may be placed in either a biohazard rigid container or enclosed 
cart for transfer to the Soiled Utility Room where additional procedures are to be followed 
prior to pick-up by Sterile Processing Service (SPS) staff within a limited time period, 
depending on the type of scope utilized.  Due to this process, it is critical that a Soiled 
Utility Room is located immediately adjacent to or in very close proximity to the Special 
Procedure Room.   
A continuous solid surface work area that incorporates the handwashing sink on the 
treatment side, provider workstation in the center, and a second sink for pre-treatment of 
scopes on the opposite end aligns with the caregiver process.  Working counter space on 
the treatment side is needed for the preparation of food/liquids, layout of devices, and 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide

other activities related to care delivery, while working counter space on the cleanup side 
facilitates implementation of scope handling protocols.  The provider workstation supports 
routine patient documentation and communication activities associated with services 
performed in the room; it incorporates a knee space, adjacent storage for literature and 
manuals, and computer workstation, with dual monitor and webcam for telehealth 
capability.  
Devices and supplies required for procedures in the room include packaged sterile 
instruments (other than scopes/RME), 
disposable clean supplies, and food items 
such as:  
• 
Flexible and rigid endoscopes 
• 
A variety of small diagnostic devices 
(IOPI, sEMG, Swallow Solutions) 
• 
Gauze, tongue depressors, facial tissues   
• 
Small bottles/tubes 
• 
Wipes/cavi and Clorox 
• 
Endoscope kits for cleaning 
• 
Catheters 
• 
Cups 
• 
Small supply of food/liquid items for 
testing oral intake (sealed and dated 
packages, such as juice, applesauce, and 
pudding) 
• 
Supplies to attach to equipment, including 
sEMG electrodes, nasal cannulas 
• 
Inspiratory/expiratory devices to issue 
• 
Syringes (no needles) 
• 
Hemostats and suture removal kits 
• 
Education literature or brochures for 
patients/families 
Storage of these items is to be accommodated both in the Special Procedure Room and 
a shared or dedicated Clean Supply Room in close proximity.  A scope cabinet must be 
located in the room.  Packaged medical devices and instruments may alternatively be 
stored in specialized enclosed mobile carts/cabinets in the Clean Supply Room.  Storage 
needs in the procedure room are accommodated with a combination of mobile carts and 
modular casework system.  A mobile storage cart located in the staff zone facilitates 
refills from a bulk supply of stock items stored elsewhere.  Point-of-use items may be 
contained in the general storage cart in the treatment zone.  A double-locked cabinet is 
required for storage of a small quantity of numbing anesthetics; other cabinets do not 
require locks.  Storage of packaged items needs to be in a temperature and humidity 
controlled environment.   
Refer to the Room Template, Special Procedure Room, Speech Pathology (SPP02) in 
Section 4.16 and PG-18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and 
additional room contents associated with this room.

Assistive Technology Rooms (1 and 2) 
The Assistive Technology Room is a dedicated 
space that includes a variety of state-of-the art 
products, devices, and equipment that may 
enable patients with disabilities to accomplish 
daily living tasks, assist them in communication, 
education, work, or recreation activities, helping 
them to achieve greater independence and 
enhance their quality of life.  If an Assistive 
Technology Program is offered at a Medical 
Center, it is often a multidisciplinary program 
associated with PM&R; the program includes a 
variety of therapies, including Speech, 
Occupational, Vocational Rehabilitation, and 
Kinesiotherapy (James A Haley Veterans' 
Hospital) (Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical 
Center - Richmond, VA).  Multiple Assistive 
Technology Labs with different functions (such as 
the individual rooms for the “return to school” and 
STAR programs at the J.A. Haley VAMC in 
Tampa) may be collocated with Polytrauma at 
locations with a PRC.   
The Speech Pathology Assistive Technology 
Room supplements treatment options for veterans with language, cognitive, and speech 
disorders.  Speech-Language Pathologists are specialists in providing recommendations for a 
wide range of technology for individuals that are unable to speak or may need compensatory 
strategies to assist with memory or organization (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
Rehabilitation and Prosthetic Services, 2015).  Examples of assistive technology include a 
picture board paired with a laser pointer, utilization of applications (apps) for smart phones or a 
tablet, or devices that produce computerized speech accessed by an eye gaze switch.  Refer 
to the following links for additional examples: Speech Generating Devices (Speech Generating 
Devices), speech-to-language devices (Devices), and other language systems (Prentrom). 
Figure 38: Assistive Technology Room;  
J.A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital PRC, Tampa, FL 
For the purposes of planning guidelines established in this Design Guide, an Assistive 
Technology Room is to be collocated with the ASPS Clinic.  The size of the room will be 
determined based upon the population served.  Assistive Technology Room 1 is an outpatient 
clinic-based room that accommodates a minimum of two adjacent tables where a single patient 
can simultaneously try out a variety of assistive technology devices.  Assistive Technology 
Room 2 accommodates an inpatient on a stretcher or a hospital bed in the center of the room, 
up to three tables, and storage for additional devices and technology (refer to space criteria 
established in PG-18-9 Chapter 204: Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Services 
Space Planning Criteria).  In both cases, key room contents include: 
• 
Adjustable height tables in a variety of configurations around the perimeter where devices 
are set up and rotated based on the needs of the patient 
• 
Storage for devices, manuals, and supplies 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-40 
• 
A small countertop/work area with sink 
• 
Provider workstation 
• 
Telehealth/video conferencing equipment: 
 Telehealth cart in Room 1 
-
 Wall mounted TV with video conferencing equipment on a cart in Room 2 
-
In Assistive Technology Room 2, there shall be sufficient clear floor area in the center of the 
room to accommodate a wheelchair, scooter, or stretcher, as well as work space around them.  
The center of this room may accommodate an adjustable height table to facilitate specialized 
therapies and training for severely disabled patients in wheelchairs, in lieu of a hospital bed. 
Additional equipment, such as mobile device stands (table and floor mounted) may be stored in 
the Assistive Technology Room or a separate Equipment Storage Room in close proximity. 
Refer to the Room Template, Assistive Technology Room 1 (Outpatient/Clinic) (SPAT1) in 
Section 4.14 and PG-18-5, Equipment Guide List for the recommended layout and additional 
room contents associated with this room.  Two Assistive Technology Lab Room Templates in 
PG-18-12 Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center Design Guide may also be referenced for 
additional information. 
Group Room 
Depending on the size of the service and workload, Speech Pathology may have a dedicated 
Group Room or share one with Audiology.  For Speech Pathology, the room shall 
accommodate treatment and education in a group setting for 3 to 5 patients at a time, along 
with family members and staff.  The minimum room size (small Group Room) established in 
PG-18-9 Chapter 204: Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Services Space Planning 
Criteria accommodates approximately eight people and three tables.  A larger room with 
acoustically appropriate divider partition may be appropriate for combined Speech and 
Audiology Group Rooms, and permit greater flexibility.  Additional considerations include: 
• 
Provide storage for educational supplies 
• 
Furnish with stackable chairs with arms to facilitate multiple group configurations 
• 
Provide connectivity for computer workstations and telehealth as needed 
The Group Room shall be located close to the clinic entry to shorten walking distances for 
veterans and their family members, and to minimize disruption of the clinic flow. (U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction & Facilities Management, 2015). 
Soiled Utility Room 
The Soiled Utility Room is a significant clinical support component of the Speech Pathology 
Clinic.  Although there may be a shared Soiled Utility Room if the ASPS Clinic is small, soiled 
scope (RME) handling protocols must be accommodated in the room if a Special Procedure 
Room is authorized. 
Depending on local operations or requirements, the Soiled Utility Room may accommodate 
both the pre-treatment of soiled scopes immediately following a procedure, as well as the 
protocols upon receipt of the RME from point-of-use.  Activities in the Soiled Utility Room 
related to these procedures may include any of the following (U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs (9), 2016): 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-41 
• 
Pre-treatment of scopes with enzymatic solution immediately following RME use 
• 
Placement of RME in biohazard containers with enzymatic solution 
• 
Exchange transport container process – the container with the soiled RME is placed in the 
utility room and a clean container (which has been intermediate level disinfected between 
uses) acquired from clean storage is taken back to the point of use 
• 
Point of use transport container process – the container with soiled RME at point of care is 
transported to the soiled utility room where the end user will don PPE to transfer soiled 
RME to designated collection container that is properly labeled medical grade puncture 
resistant biohazard rigid container.  The point of care transport container must be 
intermediate level disinfected before returning to patient care area for subsequent use 
• 
Staff arrange for transport to facility decontamination area (Sterile Processing), or to offsite 
location per strict protocols, (including time limitation and vehicle restrictions for offsite 
transport) 
Please refer to current VA practice procedures for specific requirements.  The protocols are 
listed in this Design Guide as guidance for consideration in the establishment of essential 
space criteria for this room, including: 
• 
Work counter area and sink 
• 
Space for a minimum of two endoscope transport carts 
• 
Cabinet for storage of disposable PPE 
• 
Space for an infectious waste container and sharps disposal unit 
• 
Space for a step-on wastepaper basket 
• 
Room exhaust   
Large mobile trash and biohazard containers are 
not required room contents for ASPS.  Refer to 
PG-18-5 Equipment Guide List for a complete list 
of room contents.   
Clean Supply Room 
Figure 39: ASPS Clinic Clean Supply Room; 
Orlando VAMC, FL 
A temperature and humidity controlled Clean 
Supply Room shall be located close to the 
Speech Pathology procedure rooms.  This room 
will accommodate storage of bulk items as well as 
packaged RME, and will supplement the storage 
of point-of-use items in the procedure rooms.  The 
room will house a combination of open wire 
shelving units and enclosed mobile cabinets to 
meet local requirements.  There must be sufficient 
space for stocking mobile carts from procedure 
rooms.  The Clean Supply Room may be shared 
with Audiology in a small department scenario.  
Refer to PG-18-5 Equipment Guide List for a 
complete list of room contents.  
  

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide 
November 2017 
Page   2-42 
Equipment Storage Room 
An Equipment Storage Room shall be located close to the 
Speech Pathology Procedure Rooms, including the 
Assistive Technology Room.  It may be shared with 
Audiology and shall accommodate spare equipment and 
devices used in the department.  The room may also house 
shared medical equipment, such as the portable 
suction/aspirator.   
 Workflow and Functional Relationships 
2.
Speech Pathology requires direct access from a shared or 
dedicated reception/waiting area, which is ideally located in 
a quiet area with limited traffic.  While Speech Pathology 
Office/Treatment spaces and the Assistive Technology 
Room may be located close to the clinic entry for patient 
convenience, the Voice Treatment and Special Procedure 
Rooms should be more remote, with direct or very 
convenient access to key Support Area spaces, including 
the Soiled Utility and Clean Supply Rooms.  Sound 
attenuation considerations are also a consideration for 
location of the Voice Treatment Room, in particular.  “Off-
stage” access to patient care spaces from team work areas, 
administrative functions, and service corridors is 
recommended best practice in terms of functional planning.  
Locating Office/Treatment spaces along the facility exterior 
wall with controlled natural daylight and windows is 
recommended; however, equipment and privacy needs are 
an additional consideration.  Refer to Figure 40 which 
illustrates the functional relationships between key Speech 
Pathology spaces as well as patient/staff flow between 
them.  Refer to Section 3.0 Functional Diagrams for 
additional recommendations and discussion relative to 
planning for a collocated Audiology and Speech Pathology 
Clinic.  
Figure 40: Speech-Language 
Pathology Functional Relationships 
Functional Requirements
3.
There are specific functional and technical requirements 
associated with Speech Pathology.  Refer to Section 2.3 
Technical Considerations and Section 4.0 Room Templates 
for detailed technical criteria.  Some key considerations 
include: 
•
Wayfinding to the Service incorporating both intuitive
visual cues and clear, visible, barrier-free signage.  The
service must be individually identified in facility signage,
particularly if it is not collocated with Audiology.

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-43 
• 
Sufficient, waiting and seating, immediately adjacent to the clinic, configured so that the 
receptionists have direct visualization of patients and family members.  Noise mitigation, a 
calming environment, connection to daylight/natural light, and proximity to toilet rooms and 
vending are also important considerations.  The size of the waiting area should have 
sufficient aisle space for movement of wheelchairs and scooters.  Access to the clinic must 
also accommodate hospital beds/gurneys. 
• 
Patient Toilet(s) shall be located in the Speech Pathology Clinic Patient Area.  
• 
Staff support functions, such as a Staff Toilet, Staff Lounge, and Conference Room may be 
shared with Audiology, but are to be located within the department.  If ASPS is small, the 
Staff Lounge may be shared with an adjacent clinic or service.  
• 
Planning for accessibility/barrier-free design is very important due to patients’ disabilities.  
Wheelchairs and scooters must be accommodated in both the public and corridor areas, as 
well as in the patient care rooms themselves.  Wide door widths, smooth transitions (avoid 
thresholds); flooring materials which facilitate movement, mounting heights of devices, and 
assistive devices such as handrails, grab bars, and adjustable height furnishings are all 
considerations.  
• 
At VA Medical Centers, space for movement of gurneys/stretchers and patient beds is 
required within the Speech Pathology clinic.  Key patient care spaces must also be able to 
accommodate a stretcher or bed.  Refer to specific room descriptions and space criteria.   
• 
Sound attenuation and noise mitigation is a significant component of design for Speech 
Pathology.  Speech privacy must be maintained and sound transmission from the patient 
care spaces to the corridor and adjacent rooms’ spaces must be mitigated.  Refer to the 
Room Templates in Section 4.0 for specific criteria. 
• 
Finishes must balance infection control with sound attenuation requirements.  Non-porous, 
easily cleanable flooring (such as Welded Seam Sheet Flooring with backing) is 
recommended for the Special Procedure and Voice Treatment Rooms. 
• 
Lighting levels and types of fixtures should be developed based on industry standards for 
clinical and procedure areas, and VA criteria for these spaces.  Good overall general 
lighting is required throughout, and carefully designed lighting to help reduce patient stress 
in specific locations should be a consideration.   
• 
Incorporate best practices and lean planning principles to organize equipment, supplies, 
and devices to minimize clutter and provide a patient/veteran centered environment of care.  
Enclosed modular storage systems, built-in or modular casework, and equipment rails all 
serve to facilitate clean/uncluttered procedure/treatment environments. 
 
Environment of Care/Design Considerations 
2.2.6
Environment of Care considerations identified in the FGI publication, Guidelines for Design and 
Construction of Hospitals and Outpatient Facilities (Facility Guidelines Institute, 2014) include 
the following: 
• 
Delivery of care model, including key functional elements and relationships 
• 
Physical environment for operational efficiencies and ease of use by patients, families, 
visitors, staff, and physicians 
• 
Building infrastructure and systems support the organizational and delivery of care model 
and technology.  Design criteria for healthcare facilities are to address: 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-44 
 Light/Lighting: natural light and illumination 
-
 Views and access to nature 
-
 Wayfinding 
-
 User control of the environment 
-
 Privacy and confidentiality 
-
 Security (patients, staff, and visitors) 
-
 Surfaces, finishes, architectural details 
-
 Cultural responsiveness 
-
The Joint Commission defines additional requirements in their various publications, such as 
Environment of Care Essentials for Healthcare (The Joint Commission, 2017).  These include, 
but are not limited to, those related to infection prevention and control, life safety measures, 
and reduction of clutter. 
The design of Audiology and Speech Pathology facilities and clinics shall incorporate industry-
wide and VA best practice guidelines to achieve a Veteran-centric, healing environment that 
addresses these principles.  In particular, designs shall be mindful of the specific disabilities of 
veterans served by ASPS, including: 
• 
Hearing impairment 
• 
Visual impairment 
• 
Cognitive issues 
• 
Mobility issues 
Eliminating physical barriers and tight spaces that create treatment obstacles and may lead to 
both patient and staff stress and anxiety are essential considerations for the design of this 
clinic.  The sense of confinement and disorientation that may be associated with specific 
assessments and treatments in ASPS is also a consideration (for instance, hearing 
assessments in the audiometric booth and balance testing in the Rotary Chair).  Provisions for 
assistive listening devices in public spaces, handrails in corridors, and direct visualization of 
patients and visitors in waiting areas are relevant design and planning tools for this service. 
Additional design strategies which have been documented to mitigate stress include various 
positive distractions:  
• 
Views to the exterior: the use of large expanses of glass to allow natural light in, and should 
include landscaping or natural vistas where possible 
• 
Access to exterior courtyards: provisions for exterior seating, fountains, sculpture gardens, 
or well landscaped settings to provide a level of comfort for the patient 
• 
Proximity to refreshments: coffee bars, snacks 
• 
Interior accoutrements: artwork, adequate seating, and interior finishes 
• 
Lighting design: the use of adequate lighting is essential to the comfort of the healthcare 
environment.  While significant for reading and the performance of caregiver tasks, proper 
lighting levels (and types of lighting) are a factor in affording levels of emotional and 
psychological comfort for the patient. 
An increasing trend of patients with service animals has been observed since the update to the 
VA regulation regarding Animals on VA Property, which provides access for service animals 
(such as guide dogs for visually impaired patients); therefore, accommodations for service 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-45 
animals such as proximity to outdoor space and selection of easily cleanable finishes, may also 
be a consideration. 
Specific room criteria, significant functional relationships, and other design strategies and 
considerations related to the design of ASPS facilities are discussed in greater detail in other 
sections of this Design Guide. 
 
Considerations for Women Veterans 
2.2.7
Provisions for female veterans in the Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic shall follow the 
guiding principles and standards established in the current version of PG-18-9: Space Planning 
Criteria, Chapter 258: Women Veterans Clinical Service.  While designated service/functional 
areas are not required for female veterans in the ASPS Clinic, considerations for privacy and 
safety are important, particularly in the Reception Area, Waiting, and Patient Toilet Rooms.  In 
ASPS patient care spaces, staff is always present with patients when they are in the rooms.  
Privacy curtains are not needed since patients do not disrobe for any of the care.

Technical Considerations 
2.3
 
Codes and Standards 
2.3.1
VA functions as the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) for all VA facilities and projects, and 
has the responsibility to guard public health and safety through enforcement of its adopted 
codes.  Planning, design, and construction of all VA Audiology and Speech Pathology facilities 
shall be in accordance with this document and with the latest editions and/or revisions of all VA 
and industry applicable codes and standards.  The more stringent code and/or standard shall 
be applied to VA facilities.  Requirements in this Design Guide shall not be construed as 
authorization to disregard or violate applicable local codes and regulations.  If there is a 
conflict, the A/E shall provide VA with a recommendation for action to mitigate the conflict. 
Please refer to the PG-18-3 (Topic 1) for a list of Codes, Standards, and Executive orders. 
 Other Recommended Reference Standards 
1.
Planning, design, and construction of VA Audiology and Speech Pathology facilities shall also 
consider recommendations and best practices associated with the following standards and 
regulations: 
• 
Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Outpatient Facilities (FGI), Current 
Edition, published by the Facilities Guidelines Institute (FGI) with the assistance of the U.S. 
Department of Health & Human Services (Facility Guidelines Institute, 2014). 
• 
The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA): This law 
protects individuals’ rights to audible as well as visual privacy, and is specifically applicable 
to protection of each individual’s medical records, private information, and communications.  
The law protects all conversations between patients and admission interviewers, 
caregivers, nurses, physicians, and families.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act (ARRA) passed by U.S. government in 2009 enacts special provisions and legal 
enforcement tools for patient privacy, protection, and security.  Office of Civil Rights (OCR) 
monitors HIPAA security rule compliance based on ARRA provisions.  Current penalties 
that can be implied by OCR for non-compliance with HIPAA are divided in four categories: 
(i) without knowledge; (ii) based on reasonable cause; (iii) willful neglect and (iv) willful 
neglect, not corrected.  Penalties differ per violation versus maximum penalty according to 
these four categories and vary between $100 and up to $1,500,000.  
In locations subject to flooding during severe storms, VA protocols for protection of valuable 
equipment/technology shall be considered (VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User Meetings, and 
Field Surveys, 2016-17). 
 
Architectural Systems 
2.3.2
In addition to previously cited reference codes and standards, refer to the current version of 
Room Finishes, Door & Hardware Schedule Program Guide (PG-18-14) and the Room Data 
Sheets associated with Room Templates in Section 4.0 of this Design Guide as the basis of 
design for Architectural Systems in an Audiology and Speech Pathology clinic.  Specific 
considerations for ASPS are discussed in this section. 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-48 
 Location of Spaces 
1.
A key consideration for the location and layout of the Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic is 
noise mitigation.  Noise-sensitive spaces should be located away from noisy areas since the 
acoustical performance of rooms depends on the function of adjacent spaces. 
Where a project necessitates location of the ASPS clinic near sources of transportation noise 
such as roadways, railways, and airports, a noise study is recommended to determine the 
noise levels impacting the project.  Based on the results of the study, the exterior building shell 
may require design enhancements to control the transmission of the exterior noise to achieve 
acceptable levels for the clinic: 
• 
The highest one-hour average A-weighted noise level (dBA) in a space shall not exceed 
the value of the NC criterion for a space by more than 5 dBA.  For example, if the HVAC 
noise criterion for a space is NC-35, the highest one-hour average A-weighted 
transportation noise level shall not exceed 40 dBA.   
In order to avoid the necessity of enhanced exterior building construction, including expensive 
window systems in high noise level areas, locate noise-sensitive spaces in the interior of the 
building away from windows or on the side of the building shielded from the transportation 
noise. 
 Corridors 
2.
The width of corridors shall be designed in accordance with building codes and standards; 
however, there are specific considerations associated with an ASPS clinic: 
• 
At VAMCs, patients in hospital beds or gurneys may be transported to and treated in the 
clinic  
• 
Corridors at both inpatient and outpatient locations must accommodate the movement of 
wheelchairs (including motorized wheelchairs (scooters)), and mobile medical equipment   
• 
Audiometric Examination Suites have out-swinging doors 
It is recommended that patient area corridors within the Audiology and Speech Pathology clinic 
at a hospital/medical center be designed with a minimum 8’-0” (2440 mm) clear width to 
accommodate the passage of equipment or beds and two stretchers and/or wheelchairs.  This 
minimum width is also recommended in order to accommodate clear passage in front of the 
Audiometric Examination Suites (refer to Figure 16 and Figure 57).  In non-patient areas and 
outpatient clinical spaces without gurneys, corridors may be a minimum of 6’-0” (1830 mm) in 
clear width. 
 Ceilings 
3.
The typical ceiling height of corridor, patient care, staff, and support spaces in the ASPS clinic 
shall be 9’-0” (2740 mm) above finished floor (AFF).  The recommended finished interior height 
of a prefabricated Audiometric Exam Suite/Booth is 8 ‘-0” (2440 mm) minimum clear (refer to 
Figure 41); this is greater than the height of a standard prefabricated sound suite/booth 
(approximately 6’-6” (1980 mm)).  The taller interior dimension is recommended in order to 
reduce the sense of confinement inside the booth.  However, additional consideration must be 
given to ensure there is adequate space above the prefabricated booth to accommodate 
mechanical, lighting, and fire protections systems; the overall height of the prefabricated 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-49 
system is approximately 19” (480 mm) greater than the interior dimension.  Careful 
coordination with vendor equipment drawings and specific requirements is required, particularly 
for renovation projects.   
Refer to Section 2.3.3 Interior Design for discussion of ceiling finishes.  Refer to Paragraph 8 
Acoustics and the Room Templates for recommended noise reduction criteria and discussion.  
 
Figure 41: Diagrammatic Prefabricated Sound Booth Cross-Section 
 Floors 
4.
Refer to Section 2.3.3 Interior Design for discussion of flooring finishes.  Prefabricated sound 
suites/booths have a built-up sub floor. 
 Walls 
5.
Partitions shall be designed based on the sound transmission criteria established in the Room 
Data Sheets for specific rooms.  Refer to Paragraph 8 Acoustics for additional discussion of 
sound attenuation considerations, and Section 2.3.3 Interior Design for discussion of wall 
finishes. 
 Doors 
6.
Most doors in the ASPS clinic shall be 1-3/4” (40 mm) thick, solid core, flush wood doors in 
hollow metal frames.  Specialty doors include the Audiometric Examination Suites doors, which 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-50 
are pre-manufactured, insulated steel components of the sound suite/booth assembly.  
Alternative door materials such as hollow metal or high-impact doors fully clad in solid vinyl 
guard sheets may be considered in order to achieve specific fire ratings or to increase 
durability provided that other criteria established in this Design Guide are met.  
The nominal door opening width for all patient care and Support Area spaces shall be 44” 
(1120 mm) in order to accommodate the movement of wheelchairs, scooters and mobile 
medical equipment/carts; at VA Medical Centers an additional 12” (300 mm) or  24” (610 mm) 
opening width may be considered to facilitate maneuvering hospital beds or gurneys into 
specific rooms.  These rooms include: 
• 
At least one Audiometric Examination Suite 
• 
Special Procedure Room 
• 
Voice Treatment Room 
• 
Assistive Technology Room 2 
Doors indicated on room templates are a single leaf; additional width may be accommodated 
with a second inactive leaf.   
The ASPS clinic/suite entry door(s) shall be 48” (1220 mm) minimum width; additional opening 
width is recommended for suite entry doors at medical centers (i.e. via a 36” (910 mm) or 44” 
(1120 mm) pair of doors to achieve a 6’-0” (1830 mm) or 7’-4” (2240 mm) opening width).  
Entry doors into the ASPS clinic shall have automatic operators. 
Audiometric Examination Suite Doors 
Room templates for the Audiometric Sound Suites are developed based on a two-door 
configuration on each side of the double-wall assembly (one interior/in-swinging and one 
outer/out-swinging) on both the control side and exam side in order to maximize flexibility.  A 
single-leaf 44” (1120 mm) wide door is preferred; however, an uneven pair (such as 36” (910 
mm) plus 12” (300 mm) or 24” (610 mm) leaf) may be utilized in lieu of a single leaf in order to 
minimize the weight of the door, or to achieve a larger opening width.  Doors shall swing clear 
(180 degrees or 90 degrees where applicable) against the sound booth outer and interior walls; 
maintaining the required corridor widths in front of booths is a significant planning consideration 
(refer to Figure 16).  Vision panels shall be provided in sound suite/booth doors. 
Sound Attenuation Considerations 
While standard doors with mechanical sound seals that achieve an STC rating of 
approximately 27 are acceptable for some Audiology and Speech Pathology spaces, most of 
the doors in the clinic should be acoustical door systems with ratings of at least 40 STC.  For 
specific door sound attenuation criteria, please refer to the Room Data Sheets and Paragraph 
8 Acoustics of this guide.  Also, refer to PG-18-3: Topic 11 - Noise Transmission Control and 
FGI Guidelines (Facility Guidelines Institute, 2014) for acoustical requirements/standards not 
addressed in this Design Guide. 
 Casework 
7.
For planning and utilization concerns, casework systems with modular components will provide 
flexibility and durability.  Casework systems shall incorporate components dimensioned for 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide

ease of multiple re-use applications.  Facilities may consider a variety of available solutions 
including: 
• 
standardized modular “box” casework, including a combination of wall hung and floor 
mounted storage components, and sink cabinet 
• 
horizontal rail system with interchangeable storage components, including sink unit 
Casework systems shall be integrated with space planning to avoid corner installations and 
filler panels. 
Countertops for all clinical and clinical support areas shall be solid impervious resin material 
which offers long-term durability, and resists chipping and staining from medical agents 
expected to be used in clinical environments.  For areas where strong chemicals are used, 
such as soiled utility rooms, seamless stainless steel counters with integral backsplash should 
be used.  Plastic laminate veneer material shall only be used for vertical and non-clinical 
horizontal applications. 
 Acoustics 
8.
General 
Properly functioning Audiology and Speech Pathology spaces require appropriate acoustical 
design of interior room acoustics, and acoustical isolation measures to control sound 
transmission, background noise, and vibration.  For spaces used for speech communication, 
well-controlled reverberation characteristics are recommended to achieve sound clarity and 
good speech intelligibility.  Proper design and installation of partitions (including walls, floors, 
ceilings, and roofs) as well as building components (such as windows and doors) are required 
to control sound transmission into and out of spaces.  These considerations are discussed in 
this Section and Section 2.3.6 Noise and Vibration.  For specific room sound attenuation 
criteria, please refer to the Room Data Sheets.  Also, refer to PG-18-3: Topic 11 - Noise 
Transmission Control and FGI (Facility Guidelines Institute, 2014) for acoustical 
requirements/standards not addressed in this Design Guide. 
Acoustical criteria for key Audiology and Speech Pathology spaces are established based on 
the functions and acoustical sensitivities of each room.  A space not found in the Room Data 
Sheets shall be treated comparably to the space to which it is most similar (for example, the 
Telehealth Room should be treated the same as the Audiology Rehabilitation/Counseling 
Room).  The STC (Sound Transmission Class), IIC (Impact Insulation Class), CAC (Ceiling 
Attenuation Class), and Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) ratings are minimum criteria.  
Higher values than listed will result in better acoustics.   
The acoustical criteria for walls around spaces are provided in terms of STC ratings.  Where 
two spaces with different partition STC criteria are located next to each other, the higher STC 
rating criterion should be used.  Partition intersection and termination details which control 
sound transmission and meet the criteria shall be implemented.   
The acoustical isolation criteria in the Room Data Sheets are based on the assumption that 
typical healthcare spaces are located above and below the noise-sensitive Audiology and 
Speech Pathology spaces.  It is also assumed that noise-sensitive spaces are not being 
located such that the room entrance doors connect to a main lobby or corridor with a lot of 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-52 
people activity.  If this noisier condition occurs, the STC rating criteria for the corridor walls and 
doors should be increased by 5-10 STC to account for it.   
To ensure that the acoustical design goals for the Audiology and Speech Pathology spaces are 
achieved, post construction testing should be performed.  The noise reduction between spaces 
can be measured following ASTM E336; NIC (Noise Isolation Class) ratings for these tests can 
be determined following ASTM E413.  Typically, for the Audiology and Speech Pathology 
spaces, an NIC rating no more than 5 points below the STC rating of the partition or door 
between tested spaces indicates compliance with the acoustical isolation design criteria. 
Audiology 
Numerous diagnostic tests performed in Audiology are highly sensitive to reverberation and 
interference from sound transmission, background noise, as well as electromagnetic sources.  
Site visit observations/interviews, a recent Post-Occupancy Evaluation of an ASPS Clinic in a 
new VA facility (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (1), 2017), and acoustical criteria listed for 
comparable healthcare spaces in FGI (Facility Guidelines Institute, 2014) suggest that current 
VA criteria for Audiology and Speech Pathology spaces (STC 40 or 45 listed in PG-18-3: Topic 
11 - Noise Transmission Control and FGI  may be too low).  Therefore, STC 50 is the minimum 
criterion established in the Room Data Sheets for most of the partitions around Audiology and 
Speech Pathology spaces.  The rationale for acoustical criteria developed for key Audiology 
rooms is briefly described in the following paragraphs.  
(a) 
Audiometric Examination Suite 1 
Audiometric Examination Suite 1 provides a highly controlled environment for a wide 
range of audiologic assessments, including hearing screening, speech recognition, 
tympanometry, C&P Examinations, and hearing aid assessments.  A two-sided, double 
wall prefabricated suite is typically used in VA health care facilities to perform these 
activities.  Specifications for the prefabricated rooms are documented in the VHA 
Handbook 1170.02 Appendix D; these rooms shall meet ANSI S3.1-1999 [R2008] 
Maximum Permissible Ambient Noise Levels for Audiometric Test Rooms. 
(b) 
Audiometric Examination Suite 2 
For Audiometric Examination Suite 2, where there is a prefabricated booth inside of a 
room, specific acoustical criteria are provided in the Room Data Sheets for the control 
side, including high STC partitions and room door, effective sound absorbing ceiling, and 
sound absorptive wall treatment.  The exam side/booth shall comply with the same 
requirements as Audiometric Examination Suite 1.  Post-construction acoustical testing of 
the control side shall be required to ensure room compliance with ANSI and other 
acoustical criteria established in this Design Guide.  This audiometric testing 
configuration may be preferred over Audiometric Examination Suite 1 for retrofitting in 
existing buildings or where more flexibility is desired.   
(c) 
Other Diagnostic and Treatment Spaces 
Additional Audiology diagnostic and treatment rooms which require a significant level of 
acoustical control are the Programming/Fitting, Cochlear Implant Mapping, and 
Electrophysiology Rooms. 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-53 
• 
The Hearing Aid Analyzer/Real Ear Measurement System, which measures the 
performance of hearing aid devices in the Programming/Fitting Room, is sensitive to 
interference from external and background noise. 
• 
In Cochlear Implant Mapping, patients learning to hear for the first time with their 
implants require a quiet environment where reverberation is well controlled. 
• 
Testing conducted in Electrophysiology also requires a quiet environment with 
minimal interference.  High STC partitions and room door(s), effective sound 
absorbing ceiling systems, and sound absorptive wall treatment will result in 
acoustical environments conducive for the functions in these rooms. 
(d) 
Hearing Aid Lab 
Partitions with high acoustical performance are required for the Hearing Aid Lab to control 
the transmission of noise to surrounding spaces that is generated by operation of the 
buffer/grinder workstation(s).  Consideration for sound transmission at the door is 
addressed in the Room Data Sheet as well. 
Speech-Language Pathology 
The basis for determining the acoustical criteria for the Speech-Language Pathology spaces is 
similar to those for the Audiology spaces.  However, since speech therapy and diagnostics 
involve the generation of sound, the resulting acoustical criteria for the Speech Pathology 
spaces incorporates more consideration for controlling patient speech transmission out of the 
spaces.  The louder the speech levels generated, the higher the acoustical performances 
required for the partitions to control the speech transmission to other spaces and maintain 
speech privacy. 
(a) 
Voice Treatment Room 
Since this room accommodates equipment that measures and analyzes the acoustic 
properties of speech and voice, higher acoustically rated partitions are specified for this 
room compared to other Speech Pathology spaces. 
(b) 
Other Diagnostic and Treatment Spaces 
The Office/Treatment, Assistive Technology, and Special Procedure Rooms have similar 
requirements for acoustical isolation and speech privacy.  The acoustical criteria for 
partitions, ceilings, and doors in these rooms are identified in the Room Data sheets. 
 
Interior Design 
2.3.3
In addition to previously cited reference codes and standards, refer to Interior Design Manual 
for New Construction of Hospitals and Clinics, Room Finishes, Door & Hardware Schedule 
Program Guide PG-18-14 and the Room Data Sheets in Section 4.0 of this Design Guide as 
the basis of design and selection of finishes for interior spaces in an Audiology and Speech 
Pathology clinic.  Specific considerations for ASPS are discussed in this section. 
 Interior Finishes 
1.
Extensive criteria are addressed in the above-referenced documents for the selection of 
surface and furnishing material products, (such as non-flammable/flame spread characteristics, 
resilience/impact resistance, durability, reduce user fatigue, joints/seams/assembly, safe and 
efficient for use in occupied patient settings, supports clinical needs, acoustic properties, non-

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide

Page   2-54 
toxic, minimize reflectivity and glare, patient and staff safety, etc.).  These are all applicable for 
the design of Audiology and Speech Pathology facilities; however, there are several key 
considerations:   
• 
Acoustical control/sound attenuation 
• 
Infection control 
• 
Movement of wheeled  traffic 
• 
Staff Safety 
• 
Patient mobility 
Selection of wall, flooring, and ceiling materials shall meet the noise reduction and sound 
attenuation requirements specified for the key functional spaces in this department.  However, 
sound attenuation characteristics of materials such as carpet tile and acoustical wall treatment 
panels must be balanced with considerations for infection control and the movement of 
wheeled traffic, including gurneys, stretchers, mobile equipment/supply carts, and motorized 
wheelchairs/scooters.  Carpet tile (with anti-microbial and other properties suitable for the 
healthcare environment) may be used in spaces such as the Audiometric Sound Suites, 
Programming Fitting, Rehab/Counseling, Speech Pathology Office/Treatment, Cochlear 
Implant Mapping, Group Rooms, Staff Offices, and Conference Rooms to help achieve sound 
attenuation criteria.  Carpet tile may also be considered for use in public spaces including the 
Waiting Room/Area and Audiology patient corridor areas, but careful evaluation of the selected 
product is required: 
 “…different types of and brands of carpet may have significantly different levels of 
resistance to wheeled devices.  Installation of a mock-up to test flooring materials in 
relationship to wheeled equipment and devices used in a facility is recommended.  Carpet 
should not be automatically discounted as inappropriate due to this challenge as it has 
major advantages over hard-surface flooring in terms of noise reduction, acoustics, and 
residential appearance, all of which are important in creating a comfortable, attractive living 
environment for patients” (Facility Guidelines Institute, 2014). 
Carpet tile is not an option for use in ASPS exam, treatment, and procedure spaces, including 
Cerumen Management, Hearing Aid Repair, Voice Treatment, Special Procedure Rooms, and 
Support Area spaces.  In these rooms, Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT) or Welded Seam Sheet Flooring 
(WSF) is required.  Considerations for material selection shall include: 
• 
Ease of maintenance 
• 
Readily cleanable 
• 
Impact by germicidal cleaning solutions (if any) 
Partition construction (STC rating), sound attenuation at doors (via sound gasketing and/or 
door material/properties), and high NRC/CAC rated ceiling materials will help balance sound 
reflective properties of impervious flooring materials in noise generating spaces, such as the 
Cerumen Management Room, Hearing Aid Lab, and Speech Procedure Room.  Where sound 
absorptive wall treatment is called for in the Room Data Sheets, materials shall be non-porous, 
soil resistant, and washable.  
Flooring material selection for the Hearing Aid Lab must also consider slip resistance.  Dust 
and water generated by buffing/grinding activities, particularly if open, countertop mounted 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide

equipment is used, may cause slippery conditions on the floor (VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, 
User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-17). 
Patients needing Audiology and Speech Pathology services may have multiple disabilities that 
affect both cognitive skills and mobility; patients may be disoriented, either because of their 
disability or due to certain diagnostics/treatments in the clinic.  All floor transitions shall be flush 
to avoid tripping hazards and to facilitate the movement of wheeled traffic.  Minimizing color 
contrast in flooring patterns and between walls and floors may reduce falling risk, particularly 
for visually impaired patients.  Handrails in the patient corridor areas are required to assist 
mobility-impaired patients.  
Wall protection shall be provided as called for in Room Finishes, Door & Hardware Schedule 
Program Guide PG-18-14, including solid surface material behind wall-mounted lavatories.   
Telehealth Room (Remote Clinician Consultation) and Telehealth Exam Room 
Special considerations for the interior environment and finishes in telehealth rooms are 
discussed in the Telemedicine Room Design Program Guide (California Telemedicine and 
eHealth Center, 2011). 
As with other spaces in the Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic, sound absorptive 
materials are an important consideration for telehealth.  Rooms that echo make conversation 
between the patient and remote clinician difficult.  Noise transmission from external sources, 
such as adjacent spaces and mechanical noise will also interfere with effective communication.  
While the remote clinician consultation Telehealth Room may utilize carpet tile, the Telehealth 
Exam Room may require use of an impervious flooring material; room function and specific 
activities are to be verified for selection of appropriate materials.  
The backdrop of the video should be free of distractions and clutter.  Facilities may consider 
signage with the site location in the background to help orient the participants.   
The choice of paint color and sheen is also important.  Light neutral or blue shades to provide 
contrast with flesh tones are recommended in lieu of white or dark walls.  Paint finish should be 
matte, rather than glossy to reduce glare. 
 Furniture/Furnishings 
2.
Furniture and furnishings may be selected 
based on local requirements and 
standards; however, specific 
considerations and key elements that have 
been incorporated into room templates for 
ASPS are listed below.

-
codes and standards, and address infection control/safety measures (such as anti-
microbial properties, special coatings, moisture resistant backings) 
 Provide accommodations for bariatric patients and family members 
-
Task seating for staff may be selected based on local requirements. 
 Wayfinding 
3.
Whether ASPS is located in a remote part of a large Medical Center or in a small outpatient 
clinic, signage and appropriate wayfinding so that patients and family members can find and 
identify the service is important.  Clear, visible and barrier free signage, as well as visual cues 
via the ceiling design and floor pattern are elements that will facilitate wayfinding for individuals 
who may be disabled or disoriented.  Depending on the size of the service and facility plan, the 
Audiology and Speech Clinic may have a dedicated entrance.  
Refer to the most current version of VA Signage Design Guide for specific requirements and 
standards for signage and wayfinding.   
 
Medical Equipment/Technology 
2.3.4
 General 
1.
Medical equipment will be selected and documented based upon the preference of VHA 
clinicians and input from VA administration/project management.  Medical equipment for each 
service shall be identified with descriptions, quantities, and alternate manufacturers provided 
for all items, when available.  Some equipment is specialized with limited alternate vendors.  
Note that, although graphic representations/images of room contents are exhibited in this 
Design Guide to assist with room planning and visualization of minimum sizes and component 
parts, no implied preference for a particular manufacturer is intended.

 Audiology   
2.
Specialized equipment associated with Audiology requiring 
significant coordination includes the following items:   
• 
General audiology equipment – Audiometers, analyzers, 
diagnostic sets, and other small countertop devices for 
audiologic testing (such as Figure 43 and Figure 44).   
These often have multiple components including 
computers and speakers which require space and 
Figure 43: Diagnostic Audiometer 
Figure 44: Tympanometer 
electrical/network connectivity.   
• 
Hearing Aid Analyzer/Real Ear Measurement System – 
the device used for hearing aid fitting and programming, 
consists of a desktop measurement device/microphone 
system and small speakers (refer to Figure 45 and Figure 
46).  Advance planning relative to alternative systems is a 
consideration; for instance, one vendor’s system has built-
in speakers, while another has separate accessories, such 
as speakers, outside of the main device.  The hearing aid 
test box is an additional component of the system which 
requires desk space.   
Figure 45: Hearing Aid Analyzer/Real 
Ear Measurement System-Example 1 
Figure 46: Hearing Aid Analyzer /Real 
Ear Measurement System-Example 2 
 
• 
Prefabricated sound booth – consists of multiple pre-
manufactured components which are field assembled to 
achieve a highly controlled, sound attenuated, and 
electromagnetically shielded environment for audiometric 
testing.  This equipment requires extensive coordination 
with other building systems, including structural, 
mechanical, electrical, and fire protection.  Refer to 
Audiometric Examination Suite descriptions in Section 
2.2.4 and Suite 1, Audiometric Examination (prefab, 2-
sided suite) (AUDE1) and Suite 2, Audiometric 
Examination (single prefab booth in room) (AUDE2) for 
additional detail.  Refer to discussions related to 
coordination with applicable building systems in Section 
2.3.2 Architectural Systems, 2.3.5 Structural Systems and 
2.3.10 Fire Protection and Life Safety.   
• 
Rotary Chair System – This equipment consists of 
freestanding booth with rotary chair inside, electrical control 
console, and operator workstation, requires significant 
advance planning for space (including ceiling height), 
structural, electrical, and network systems.  An isolation 
transformer must be accommodated in a separate facility 
electrical closet (refer to Figure 26 and Figure 122).

Page   2-58 
• 
Buffer/Grinder – Equipment used to shape and smooth 
hearing aids.  Provisions for dust collection and noise 
mitigation are crucial (refer to Figure 47).  This equipment 
produces vibrations, so location in the department and 
sound attenuation are a consideration.  This equipment 
has electrical requirements and may be attached to a 
vacuum/suction device depending on model selected.   
Figure 47: Buffer/Grinder 
• 
VNG System – This equipment is used to monitor eye 
movement for the clinical study of dizziness and balance 
disorders.  This equipment has electrical and network 
requirements (refer to Figure 48).    
Figure 48: VNG System 
• 
Air or Water Caloric Irrigators – These are used in 
conjunction with the VNG system for stimulating the 
motion sensors in the ear of patients with dizziness or 
balance problems; facility/user preference will determine 
which type is to be utilized.  The air caloric irrigator (refer 
to Figure 49) is used for stimulating the horizontal semi-
canal by pumping warmed or cooled room air into the 
external ear canal.  The caloric water irrigator (refer to 
Figure 50) stimulates motion sensors in the ear using 
warm or cool water pumped into the external canal.  The 
irrigator is typically placed on a mobile cart; the water 
irrigator requires a plumbing connection at a sink/faucet.    
• 
ENT Console – A customizable cabinet used for ear 
irrigations and other cerumen management procedures, 
with several options and accessories (refer to Figure 20).  
This equipment has electrical requirements.

 Speech-Language Pathology   
3.
Specialized equipment associated with Speech-Language 
Pathology requiring significant coordination includes the 
following items: 
• 
Computerized Speech Lab –Equipment used for voice and 
speech analysis is typically located on a table or 
countertop and is connected to a non-network computer 
and monitor (refer to Figure 51).  The Speech Lab has 
electrical requirements.  
•

4.
ENT Chair 
Audiology and Speech Pathology both use an ENT 
exam/treatment chair in the following rooms (refer to Figure 54): 
•
Cerumen Management Room
•
Hearing Aid Repair Room
•
Voice Treatment Room
•
Special Procedure Room
Figure 54: ENT Chair 
The ENT chair shall be height adjustable and capable of 
rotating at least 330 degrees; the chair may be reclined to a 
variety of angles, including horizontal, although this is typically 
not a treatment position required for Audiology or Speech 
procedures.  Additional features shall include an adjustable 
headrest, arm rests which raise to facilitate patient 
access/transfer, and solid footrest (avoid an open metal bar, 
which is a tripping hazard).  A chair-mounted exam light is an 
optional accessory, which may be included based on local 
requirements; it is typically needed for the Cerumen 
Management Room.  Since the chair is heavy and requires an 
electrical outlet nearby, the planner shall coordinate in advance 
its physical placement relative to other fixed elements in the 
room.  Recommended clearances for working space around the 
chair as well as the recommended location of the floor outlets 
are indicated on the applicable room templates.  A surface 
mounted floor outlet is preferred to avoid the tripping hazard of a 
cord running to an electrical outlet on the wall.

Hi-Lo Treatment Table   
A multi-sectional, height adjustable table is recommended for Vestibulography.  During tests, 
the patient’s orientation is varied from horizontal to a seated position.  The head section of the 
table must be adjustable to a minimum of 30 degrees; height adjustability facilitates patient 
transfers from wheelchairs.  Extra (bariatric) width is recommended to support flexible 
positioning and patient recovery.  Alternative exam/procedure tables are acceptable in lieu of 
the Hi-Lo Table as long as the various treatment positions can be achieved.   
 
Structural Systems 
2.3.5
Executive Orders (EO’s) 12699 and 12941 require that all new and existing buildings 
constructed or leased by the Federal Government be seismically safe.  The EO’s require that 
nationally recognized building codes be used for the seismic design and construction of new 
buildings, and for the seismic safety assessment of existing buildings.  For structural systems 
design, refer to the current editions of the International Building Code (IBC) and VA Structural 
Design Manuals for the applicable building type.  To achieve acceptable vibration levels for 
sensitive Audiology and Speech Pathology functions, building structures should be designed to 
minimize footfall vibration. 
 Loads 
1.
The structural system shall be designed to support all equipment loads and meet required 
deflection criteria which shall be the maximum deflection allowed by manufacturer, IBC, or VA 
Structural Design Manuals.  Significant equipment identified in this Design Guide requiring 
structural design and analyses for load carrying capacity are: 
• 
Rotary Chair 
• 
Audiometric Examination Suite (Prefabricated Sound Suite) 
• 
Computerized Dynamic Posturography  
 Slab Requirements 
2.
Slab Depression 
Refer to vendor site preparation requirements and the VA Design and Construction Procedures 
PG-18-3 Topic 6: Floor Slab Depressions, for slab depressions needed for the Audiometric 
Examination Suites.  Slabs shall be depressed to accommodate prefabricated Audiometric 
Examination Suites while maintaining load carrying capacity requirements.  The minimum slab 
depression depth shall be coordinated with vendor requirements (approximately 6 1/8” (160 
mm)) plus additional allowance for adjacent flooring material.  The overall dimensions of the 
slab depression shall be established based on project requirements and the overall size of the 
prefabricated sound suite, providing for no less than a minimum clear dimension of 4” (100 
mm) between the outer wall of the sound suite and inside edge of the slab depression. 
Concrete slab levelness shall be level and true to meet vendor requirements and shall have a 
minimum flatness and levelness of FF=45 and FL=35.

Chair.  Refer to manufacturer site preparation instructions, which identify the minimum slab 
thickness needed, type of anchors, and diameter of threaded rods. 
 
Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC)  
2.3.6
 General 
1.
HVAC systems should be provided to condition individual rooms or areas as required to satisfy 
design criteria.  The HVAC system shall comply with the current version of Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) HVAC Design Manuals (PG-18-10), VA Design and Construction 
Procedures (PG-18-3), VA Master Construction Specifications (PG-18-1) and VA Standard 
Details (PG-18-4), where applicable.  The current VA design and construction criteria are 
available on the VA Technical Information Library (TIL) at VA TIL.  Any deviations from the VA 
guidelines shall be submitted and approved by the VA authority.  Where specific VA 
requirements are not available or indicated in this document, design criteria from industry 
standards such as ASHRAE, ANSI, NFPA, DOE and/or other industry recognized standards 
may be submitted to the VA authority for review and approval. 
 Exterior Design Conditions  
2.
Exterior summer and winter design conditions, as well as cooling tower wet bulb design 
temperatures, should be based on the current edition of the VA HVAC Design Manuals (PG-
18-10).  The A/E may, based on local knowledge, recommend more severe outdoor climatic 
conditions for review and approval by the VA authority.  
 Interior Design Conditions  
3.
Interior design conditions for all spaces should be maintained in accordance with the current 
version of the VA HVAC Design Manuals (PG-18-10).  
 Supply Air Requirements  
4.
For all air systems, the supply air minimum airflows shall follow the recent version of the VA 
HVAC Design Manuals (PG-18-10).  
 Filtration  
5.
For additional filtration requirements, refer to the VA HVAC Design Manuals (PG-18-10). 
 Outdoor Air Requirements 
6.
For the minimum recommended quantity of outdoor air requirements, refer to the recent 
version of the VA HVAC Design Manuals (PG-18-10).  
 Exhaust Air Requirements  
7.
Exhaust air and pressurization shall be provided as indicated in the VA HVAC Design Manuals 
(PG-18-10), as well as applicable Room Data Sheets, where applicable.  
 Noise and Vibration  
8.
In Audiology and Speech Pathology spaces, background noise from HVAC and other 
equipment needs to be controlled to prevent it from interfering with hearing assessments and 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-62 
other activities in the department (counseling, speech therapy, test signals from audiometers, 
hearing aid programming, etc.).  For HVAC noise, NC criteria are provided on the Mechanical 
Room Data Sheets (Ref. PG-18-10 Chapter 6 Table 5 – Mechanical Room Data Sheets, 4.19).  
The NC ratings are maximum criteria.  Although lower NC ratings are better for the testing 
rooms, lower ratings are not necessarily better for spaces where the primary acoustical 
concern is speech privacy.  Some background noise in such spaces helps to mask intrusive 
speech transmission from adjacent spaces. 
NC criteria are based on octave band noise levels (in dB units) in the 63 Hz to 8000 Hz 
frequency range.  However, lower frequency noise not taken into account by the NC system 
can cause problems (see Chapter 48 Sound and Vibration Control of the 2015 ASHRAE 
Handbook – HVAC Applications (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-
Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE), 2015).  Although newer systems of evaluating HVAC 
noise such as the NCB system include this lower frequency noise and could be used, the NC 
system is well established and can be used as long as this lower frequency noise is afforded 
due consideration.  Therefore, in addition to compliance with the NC ratings in the Mechanical 
Room Data Sheets, in the 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz octave bands, noise levels should not exceed   
65 dB. 
If the lower frequency noise exceeds 65 dB, noise-induced vibration can be perceptible and 
human discomfort can occur.  In the 65-75 dB range lower frequency octave bands, for 
lightweight wall and ceiling systems, noise levels are likely to generate vibration that may be 
perceptible and that have a slight possibility of generating rattles in light fixtures, doors, 
windows, and other similar objects.  In the 75-85 dB range lower frequency octave bands, for 
lightweight wall and ceiling systems, noise levels have a high probability of generating easily 
perceptible noise-induced vibration, and audible rattling in light fixtures, doors, windows, and 
other similar objects may be anticipated.  Within the 16-31.5 Hz octave band range, noise 
above 65 dB may be objectionable to some people who experience a sense of oppressiveness 
or depression in such an environment.  Such a feeling may not occur until subjected to hours of 
continuous exposure to this lower frequency high energy noise and may be felt more than it is 
heard. 
Vibration levels in a healthcare facility should not disturb the functioning of vibration-sensitive 
equipment, conduction of medical tests and procedures, and the comfort of patients.  Barring 
more stringent criteria for special medical equipment, vibration criteria appropriate for hospital 
operating rooms are also appropriate for Audiology and Speech Pathology areas.  Based on 
the Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology (IEST) Building Vibration Criteria for 
Vibration Measured on Building Structure (Chapter 48 Sound and Vibration Control of the 2015 
ASHRAE Handbook – HVAC Applications), operating room floor vibration velocity levels should 
not exceed 0.004 in/s in the 8-80 Hz range.  Below 8 Hz, the maximum allowable vibration 
velocity level curve rises with decreasing frequency to slightly over 0.020 in/s at 1 Hz.  
Vibration velocity levels below these criteria are not expected to be perceptible. 
In sections of the VA HVAC Design Manual (PG-18-10), including Section 2.3.1, Acoustic 
Analysis, guidelines are provided to control HVAC noise.  Note that, contrary to the guidelines, 
in Subsection 2.3.1.4, Unitary Equipment, allowing the NC rating criteria in spaces with unitary 
equipment to be increased 5 NC points is not recommended.  Additional guidelines include the 
location of air volume dampers and selection of air diffusers.  Dampers should be remotely 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-63 
located with noise attenuation (such as non-metallic insulated flexible ducts) between any 
damper and duct termination.  Diffusers and grilles should be selected to achieve the NC 
criteria based on the specific acoustical characteristics of each space rather than the standard 
room characteristics used to determine the published NC ratings of the diffusers and grilles.  In 
order to meet the recommended NC criteria, Audiology and Speech Pathology spaces will 
require diffusers and grilles that have published NC ratings 5-10 NC points lower than the NC 
criteria for the rooms. 
To control low frequency noise, equipment capable of generating high levels of such noise 
should be located far away from noise-sensitive spaces; the main supply and return air 
ductwork from such equipment should not run through ceiling plenums over noise-sensitive 
spaces.  This equipment should be located on stiff heavy structures (not lightweight roof 
systems) and be equipped with appropriate vibration isolation.  To achieve acceptable vibration 
levels and structure borne noise levels, mechanical equipment should be properly vibration 
isolated following the guidelines in Chapter 48 Sound and Vibration Control of the 2015 
ASHRAE Handbook – HVAC Applications.  See also Section 2.6, Vibration Control, of the VA 
HVAC Design Manual 2011. 
Compliance Testing 
Analyses of mechanical system generated noise shall be performed to demonstrate that noise 
criteria will be met in accordance with this Design Guide, and based on sound data for the 
equipment used as the Basis for Design, per Section 2.3.1 of the VA HVAC Design Manual 
2011 (PG-18-10).  Specifications shall require the sound levels of the actual equipment 
installed to be no higher than the sound data levels used in the analyses, otherwise excessive 
noise levels may occur. 
To ensure that the HVAC noise criteria are met in the Audiology and Speech Pathology 
spaces, octave band noise levels should be measured in representative spaces with the HVAC 
equipment operating.  With octave band noise levels measured from 16 Hz to 8000 Hz, NC 
ratings can be determined, and the 16 Hz and 31.5 Hz octave band noise levels can be 
compared to the 65 dB criterion.  Tests and analyses are best performed by a qualified 
acoustical consultant. 
 Automatic Temperature Control Criteria  
9.
The automatic temperature controls system, including the use of individual temperature 
controls for specific spaces, shall be provided in accordance with the VA HVAC Design 
Manuals (PG-18-10).

Medical gas and medical vacuum supply outlets should be provided in accordance with the 
current versions of the VA Plumbing Design Manual (PG-18-10).  Coordinate project specific 
requirements with the VA authority.  
 Seismic Requirements  
5.
Where applicable, earthquake resistive plumbing design should comply with the seismic 
requirements of the most current version of VA Seismic Design Handbook (H-18-8) and VA 
Plumbing Design Manual (PG-18-10). 
 Design Features  
6.
Plumbing design features considered by the A/E that are not specifically outlined in the VA 
Plumbing Design Manual (PG-18-10) shall be submitted and approved by the VA authority prior 
to implementation into the design. 
 
Electrical Systems 
2.3.8
 General 
1.
Power distribution systems, lighting, and lighting controls shall provide reliable, energy efficient 
infrastructure to support the rooms or areas within the Audiology and Speech-Language 
Pathology spaces. 
The electrical systems shall comply with the current version of Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) PG-18-10, Electrical Design Manuals, PG-18-3, Design and Construction Procedures, 
PG-18-1, Master Construction Specifications, and PG-18-4, Standard Details, as applicable.  
Where state or local codes are more stringent than the VA electrical standards and industry 
codes, the A/E shall submit recommendations for deviation to VA for review and approval.

 Lighting  
2.
Lighting design parameters are shown on the Room Data Sheet for each room type.  Lighting 
levels specified are applicable at the work plane for each room, as noted on the Room Data 
Sheet.  The work plane shall be 2’-6” (760 mm) where not indicated on the Room Data Sheet.  
Lighting shall comply with the general requirements of the VA Lighting Design Manual (PG-18-
10) and this Design Guide.  Where conflicts exist, the more stringent requirement shall take 
precedence. 
The A/E has the option of using either fluorescent or LED lighting technologies, but shall 
comply with the Reflected Ceiling Plan in Section 4 of this Design Guide for the placement of 
luminaires.  Where deviations are required due to field conditions or coordination with other 
trades, the A/E shall provide lighting design to achieve the parameters specified.  The design 
A/E shall select appropriate lumen output or quantity of lamps for each luminaire to render the 
required illuminance level for each room and task.  
Because many rooms have multiple uses which may require different illuminance values, 
flexibility of the lighting system is required in these spaces.  The design A/E must implement 
multiple-level lighting strategies by selecting luminaires with linear or step-dimming capabilities, 
or using multi-level switching, or both.  Multi-level switching solutions shall be configured such 
that each lighting level results in even illumination throughout the space.  The A/E shall perform 
point-to-point foot-candle calculations for each room or area using commercially available 
computer software to validate compliance with lighting level and energy conservation 
requirements.  These calculations shall be documented by the A/E and provided to VA for 
review and concurrence. 
Telehealth Room 
Lighting is important for sufficient image quality.  Ambient overhead lighting alone is often 
insufficient, requiring an additional task light source.  Provide a diffuse linear light fixture, wall 
mounted in front of the subject for even illumination without strong shadows.  Where practical, 
provide additional wall mounted diffuse fixtures on either side of the subject to further eliminate 
shadows. 
 Normal Power 
3.
The A/E shall provide electrical design for all electrically operated devices and equipment 
within the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology spaces.  The A/E shall base design on 
the latest vendor electrical requirement information for each piece of equipment. 
Consideration should be taken for the routing of cords and cables between equipment and 
connections.  Coordinate final locations of receptacles and connections with equipment and 
furniture layouts to minimize or eliminate exposed cords and cables. 
 Emergency Power  
4.
For sites provided with an Essential Electrical System (EES), provide emergency power to life 
safety systems (exit and egress lighting) from the life safety branch of the EES.  Connect 
ceiling mounted exam lights in the Voice Treatment Room (SPP01) and Special Procedure 
Room (SPP02) to the critical branch of the EES.  Where no EES exists, provide emergency 
fixtures and the above referenced exam lights with battery backup per NFPA 101 requirements.

Confirm with the VA if additional selected loads are to be connected to the EES or optional 
standby power system. 
 
Telecommunications 
2.3.9
 General 
1.
Refer to the current edition of PG-18-10 Telecommunications and Special Telecommunications 
Systems Design Manual for communications and special systems requirements.  
Telephone and computer systems are required in Audiology and Speech Pathology 
departments.  Many tests and procedures rely on computers and specialized software.  These 
computers may be standard computer workstations or come as a component of a medical 
device or system.  Audiology devices such as hearing aid programmers may connect to 
computer workstations through universal serial bus (USB), Bluetooth, or other connections, so 
additional peripherals like USB hubs and Bluetooth adaptors may be required.  Where used for 
telehealth, computers should be provided with dual monitors, speakers, camera, and 
microphone. 
 Systems, Monitoring, and Signal Systems 
2.
Telephone and Data 
Facilities shall provide at least one teletypewriter (TTY), also known as telecommunications 
device for the deaf (TDD), at each reception area. 
Data/LAN infrastructure (aka Telecommunications Plant (TIP)) should be provided where 
required for Videonystagmography (VNG), Rotary Chair, Computerized Dynamic 
Posturography, ENT microscopes, Digital Swallowing Workstation (FEES), Stroboscopy 
System, Computerized Speech Lab, Phonatory Aerodynamic System, and other medical 
equipment requiring data connections. 
Nurse Call and Code Blue (NCS) 
Where audiology services are provided in an inpatient setting, a nurse call system shall be 
provided in accordance with Telecommunications and Special Telecommunications Systems 
Design Manual (PG-18-10) and Facility Guidelines Institute: Guidelines for Design and 
Construction of Hospitals and Outpatient Facilities.  
Where audiology services are provided in an outpatient setting, provisions shall be made to 
notify outside emergency medical professionals.  
Public Address System 
A public-address system shall be provided to function as an emergency communication system 
and code blue team notification where an NCS is used. 
Electronic Security System (ESS) 
Provide systems in accordance with the VA Physical Security Design Manual (PG-18-10) for 
VA Life-Safety Protected Facilities. 
Duress/Panic Alarms shall be provided for staff use within audio booths and other patient 
treatment/exam spaces where patients are intentionally isolated or subjected to extreme quiet 
or loud sounds.

Page   2-67 
Assistive Listening Systems  
Assistive listening systems shall be provided in accordance with ADA General Guidelines 219.  
Additionally, consideration shall be made to provide assistive listening systems in the 
Reception Area (Waiting Room), Assistive Technology Room, Group Rooms, and Conference 
Room.  
Considerations shall be made for inductive loop systems compatible with hearing aids. 
Telemedicine/Telehealth Systems 
Telemedicine, as defined by the American Telemedicine Association (ATA), is “the use of 
medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to 
improve a patient’s clinical health status” (American Telemedicine Association, May 2014).  
Telemedicine commonly involves two-way video teleconferencing between a patient and 
provider but could more broadly include many other interactions, devices, and forms of 
communication. 
Telemedicine endpoints include video teleconferencing system (VTS) carts, fixed VTS 
integrated with audio visual systems, standard computers with microphone and audio, and 
smartphones.  See VA Telecommunications and Special Telecommunications Systems Manual 
(PG-18-10) for VTS requirements.  
Camera placement is crucial for conference rooms and offices.  The camera should be at eye 
level and a few feet from the subject to mimic face-to-face encounters.  Microphone selection 
and placement is equally important to ensure clear speech communication.  For offices, a 
headset microphone ensures consistent sound levels and minimal echo and noise.  For 
Conference Rooms, table-mounted microphones evenly pick up voices around the table; 
however, they may require grommets, wiring, and a floor box with conduit pathway.  Ceiling-
mounted microphones may be a better option to reduce infrastructure impact or if the 
conference table is moveable. 
The VTS equipment itself will also impact infrastructure.  A fixed VTS system is typically 
installed with conduit pathways for cabling from the microphones, cameras, and monitors back 
to the coder-decoder hardware device called a codec.  The codec may be installed on a shelf, 
in a rack, a credenza, or a podium.  The codec requires power and network connections.  
Audio-visual (A/V) equipment enabling routing of sources to displays is usually provided in 
conference rooms and/or Group Rooms in addition to the VTS equipment since these rooms 
serve multiple functions beside VTS use.  Telemedicine carts eliminate the need for most in-
wall A/V cabling but power outlets and network connections must be provided where the cart 
will be in use.  A telephone should be provided in telemedicine spaces as a backup means of 
communication as well as for troubleshooting the VTS. 
 Software 
3.
Audiology and Speech Pathology services utilize a wide range of software-based technology 
that is subject to continuous development.  Non-network connected computers and devices are 
used to run applications for diagnostics and treatment including: 
• 
Diagnostic audiometry 
• 
Posturography

 Fire Protection and Life Safety 
2.3.10
 Fire Sprinkler System 
1.
Sprinkler protection shall be designed to meet the needs of the Audiology and Speech 
Pathology spaces.  Sprinklers shall be recessed and located in the center of acoustical ceiling 
tiles.  Sprinkler finish shall complement the architectural finishes of the space.  Design shall 
follow the criteria in the VA Fire Protection Design Manual (PG-18-10) and VA Master 
Construction Specifications (PG-18-1). 
 Fire Alarm and Detection Systems 
2.
Fire alarm requirements for Audiology and Speech Pathology spaces pertain primarily to 
notification appliances.  Installation of new devices shall be in accordance with the VA Fire 
Protection Design Manual (PG-18-10) and VA Master Construction Specifications (PG-18-1). 
The need for audible notification will depend, in part, on the type of fire alarm notification 
present in the building.  Voice notification typically requires more devices tapped at a lower 
wattage in order to achieve voice intelligibility.  Conversely, horns located outside of individual 
rooms may be sufficient to meet the need for audibility levels, without the need for an additional 
device within the room.  Therefore, the type of occupant notification throughout the building 
needs to be identified. 
Audiometric Examination Suites/Booths will require a combination audible/visual notification 
device, such as a horn/strobe or speaker/strobe in order to alert occupant(s) of an alarm 
condition.  
Spaces which are not acoustically separated will require a visual notification device (strobe).  
The need for audible notification within the space will be site specific, and depend upon the 
type of audible alarm, the size of the space, and the sound transmission characteristics of the 
enclosing walls. 
Smoke detection within these areas is not typically required; however, the above referenced 
standards should be consulted. 
 Safety Considerations 
2.3.11
Audiology and Speech Pathology projects shall comply with all applicable VA Design Manuals 
and Directives associated with Life Safety and Physical Security.  Patient and staff safety 
considerations specific to Audiology and Speech Pathology are addressed in this section. 
 Clinical Safety Considerations 
1.
Infection Control 
Handwashing sinks shall be provided in all patient care spaces.  Gel/foam dispensers shall be 
provided in the prefabricated Audiometric Examination Suites/Booths since a sink cannot be 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   2-69 
installed in these locations.  Proximity to a hand wash sink (such as in an adjacent room) is an 
important consideration for the sound suites. 
Scope handling protocols, previously discussed in Section Speech-Language Pathology 
Functional Considerations must be addressed relative to the Special Procedure Room. 
Medication Safety 
Medication storage, handling, and distribution is not a significant consideration for ASPS; 
however, a limited quantity of anesthetics are used for swallow tests.  A single double-locked 
cabinet in the Special Procedure Room is sufficient for the medication used.  Task lighting at 
the countertop will minimize risk of errors.   
 Physical Safety 
2.
Staff Safety/Security Considerations 
Room layouts of Patient Care spaces have been developed with consideration for staff safety.  
Key considerations include provisions for: 
• 
Sufficient working space in the patient treatment zone/around the patient 
• 
Provider workspace is typically located close to the door to avoid entrapment if a patient 
becomes agitated 
Duress alarms (panic buttons) are called for in all patient care spaces as an additional security 
measure.  These are particularly important in the Audiometric Examination Suites, Balance 
Testing, Special Procedure, and Voice Treatment Rooms.

FUNCTIONAL DIAGRAMS 
3.0
 
General  
3.1
An Audiology and Speech Pathology department/suite may be organized in a variety of ways 
depending on services to be provided, local requirements, and the type and quantity of clinical spaces.  
Key considerations, recommendations, and scenarios for the organization of ASPS at VA Medical 
Centers and outpatient clinics are described in this section.  Audiology and Speech Pathology 
functional areas should be collocated or adjacent in a single clinic with a common waiting/reception 
area.  Support Area functions should be grouped adjacent to Patient Areas for shared “off-stage” 
access by staff and service personnel.  A shared Group Room is best located near the clinic entry for 
convenient access by patients, while Staff and Administration and Education Areas may be located at 
the perimeter, furthest from the clinic entry.  Figure 55 illustrates this general organization with 
segregation of patient, staff, and service workflows.

Inpatient 
3.2
At a VAMC, a collocated Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic is likely to include the comprehensive 
range of services described in previous sections of this document.  The layout at a VAMC must also 
consider access by stretcher/gurney traffic.  The recommended functional organization of the 
department is based on groupings of related/common activities as follows:  
• 
Hearing Assessment/Programming/Fitting Zone: this area encompasses all activities related to 
hearing evaluations and screenings, including Comp & Pen exams, and consultations, as well 
as the follow-up activities that include the programming and fitting of hearing aids.  This area 
incorporates the Audiometric Sound Suites, including one that accommodates a 
gurney/stretcher.  Rooms in this area have significant sound attenuation/noise mitigation 
requirements.  Patients may spend up to two hours in this area of the clinic.   
• 
Audiology Treatment Zone: this area accommodates routine evaluations, treatments, and 
hearing aid repairs.  Some activities in this area may generate noise and vibrations.  There are 
unique clinical support functions associated with this area. 
• 
Balance Testing Zone: this area accommodates the unique rooms associated with vestibular 
testing.  Collocation of spaces in one area is important since patients may undergo a series of 
different tests in a single appointment and a quiet area is preferred.  
• 
Speech Evaluation/Therapy Zone: the “front” of the Speech Pathology functional area 
accommodates routine speech evaluation/therapy appointments, as well as the Assistive 
Technology Lab, which benefits from access to the more “public” side of the clinic for patient 
convenience and potential access to other service areas, such as PM&R.  
• 
Speech Procedure Zone: Speech Procedure Rooms are grouped together in the “back” of the 
clinic for access to clinical support functions and for segregation from higher activity-level 
spaces.  Activities in these rooms generate noise. 
The number and types of spaces in the ASPS clinic is based on workload, provider competencies, and 
equipment.  While a variety of layouts is possible, and will be dependent upon the individual project 
Program for Design and available space, a modular organization is beneficial for this department and 
allows for continuous flow of patients and staff while also achieving the appropriate segregation of on-
stage/off-stage activities.  Locating staff/administrative and office/treatment spaces along the facility 
exterior wall with controlled natural daylight and windows is desirable.  The shared Telehealth Room is 
located close to the Staff and Administrative area per functional definition in this scenario as a “Remote 
Clinician’s Consultation Room” (it is not a patient care space) (California Telemedicine and eHealth 
Center, 2011), and for privacy and noise mitigation. 
Figure 56 illustrates an example of this organization which provides opportunities for segregation of 
patient, staff, and service circulation.

Sound Suite Modular Layout 
3.2.1
Planning for multiple sound suites in an Audiology Clinic requires consideration for placement 
within the constraints of structural bays and walking distances.  The following diagram 
illustrates the layout of multiple adjacent sound suites and suggested minimum planning 
dimensions.  The 75’-0” (22.9 M) minimum dimension needed for three end-to-end sound 
suites also represents the maximum recommended walking distance in a clinic module.

Outpatient: ACC/CBOC 
3.3
At an outpatient clinic, the ASPS Clinic should be located next to other compatible specialty services, 
such as the Eye Clinic or PM&R.  Proximity to Radiology is helpful if Speech Pathology services are 
provided.  Depending on the size of ASPS, the waiting and reception area may be shared with the 
adjacent clinic(s); however, the special needs of Audiology and Speech Pathology patients, previously 
addressed, as well as appropriate size of the waiting space must be considered.  
The organization of the department at an Outpatient Clinic should have similar considerations to that of 
a Medical Center, however there will likely be fewer procedure and specialty rooms (i.e. sound suites, 
balance testing, Special Procedure Rooms).  Hospital beds and gurneys do not need to be 
accommodated, however the corridor width in front of sound suites must be sufficient to maintain 
egress clearances at out-swinging doors.  A layout that corresponds with modular/flexible clinic 
planning with groupings of related activities (as in the VAMC example) is appropriate.  Due to the 
complexity of activities, equipment, and sound attenuation requirements, two-sided entry to 
diagnostic/treatment spaces (per the PACT prototype) is not a recommended model for this service. 
Figure 58 on the following page illustrates an example layout of an ASPS clinic in an outpatient clinic 
setting with a smaller than VAMC footprint and in the context of possible adjacent services.

ROOM TEMPLATES 
4.0
 
General 
4.1
 
Introduction 
4.1.1
The Room Templates are intended as general representations of typical space, furniture and 
equipment layout, as well as functional and utility supporting needs.  The Room Templates 
were developed as a design tool to assist the Project Team in understanding the choices to be 
made during design, and to assist designers in understanding VA’s space and functional 
requirements for the Audiology and Speech Pathology Service.  The Room Templates are not 
intended to be project specific and are not meant to limit design opportunities.  However, the 
indicated net square feet (NSF) are the minimum acceptable square feet (the +/- rule does not 
apply).  Dimensions indicated are a close approximation to achieve the required net square 
feet. 
While this information is provided for a majority of spaces required, it is not possible to foresee 
all possible variations or future requirements.  The project-specific space program shall be 
used as the basis for individual project design. 
The Room Templates must be reviewed against project criteria and any special requirements.  
Users shall follow other VA criteria and standards required by VA.  Equipment manufacturers 
shall be consulted for the most current equipment information such as actual dimensions, 
weights, and utility requirements. 
Each Room Template includes an axonometric view, floor plan, reflected ceiling plan, 
elevations, room data sheet, and an equipment list.  The equipment list provides a 
comprehensive overview of space planning, utility requirements, and locations for the key room 
in this service.

Site Visit Summaries 
5.2
An initial step for the update and development of space criteria for Audiology and Speech-Language 
Pathology (ASPS), involved site visits to several Audiology and Speech Pathology clinics at VA Medical 
Centers and Outpatient Clinics/CBOC’s in Florida and Washington, D.C. in October, 2016.  The team 
conducted comprehensive walk-through surveys of the facilities and interviewed clinical staff in order to 
develop an understanding of ASPS operations and associated space/facility requirements.  Survey 
questionnaires completed by key personnel supplemented information obtained on the tours.  The 
following facilities were toured: 
• 
Bradenton CBOC (Audiology), Bradenton, FL 
• 
C.W. Bill Young VA Medical Center (Audiology, Speech Pathology), Bay Pines, FL 
• 
James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital (Speech Pathology), Tampa, FL 
• 
James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital-Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center (Speech Pathology), 
Tampa, FL 
• 
James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital-North 46th St. (Offsite Audiology Clinic), Tampa, FL 
• 
Orlando VA Medical Center (Audiology and Speech Pathology), Orlando, FL 
• 
Washington DC VA Medical Center (Audiology and Speech Pathology), Washington, DC 
The team would like to thank the many facility staff members who took time out of their workday to tour 
these locations and candidly discuss their space and operations.

 Overview 
1.
Bradenton is a Community Based Outpatient Clinic in the Bay Pines Service area which offers 
Primary Care and several specialty services including: Dental, Eye, and Audiology.  Audiology 
and Optometry share a common entrance, separate from the main entrance and shared 
reception/waiting area.  Patient care and clinical support functions for the small Audiology 
Clinic are organized along a single corridor.  
Facility Analysis 
This facility is an example of a small Audiology Clinic located in a CBOC.  The diagram 
illustrates the clinic’s relationship/proximity to other outpatient services, location of entrances, 
and patient and staff circulation paths relative to the service.

Audiology
2.
Audiology has four patient care spaces, including two Office/Treatment spaces and two 
Audiology Technician rooms.  The clinic has two prefabricated sound booths located inside the 
Office/Treatment spaces; one of the booths is double-wall and accommodates Compensation 
& Pension exams.  The Audiologist/Provider space located outside of the booths is used for 
basic screening, patient counseling and demonstrations, as well as hearing aid programming 
and fitting.  The two Audiology Tech rooms have multiple functions, including hearing aid 
repairs and cerumen management.  An alcove located along the corridor accommodates 
clinical support functions, including clean supplies, a buffer/grinder workstation, and hearing aid 
processing workstation.  Challenges include: 
•
Booth size and lack of accessibility for patients in wheelchairs and scooters
•
Lack of sound attenuation between provider work/testing/hearing aid programming space
and corridor
•
Wire management - insufficient electrical outlets

• 
Support functions in corridor generate noise and dust 
• 
Processing workstation in common area - lack of privacy for shipping and receiving of 
expensive hearing aid parts.  Package labels and information stored on the computer 
contain private patient information. 
• 
Expanding open access will increase the number of unscheduled/walk-in patients. 
• 
Shared waiting space becomes crowded at peak times of day.

C.W. Bill Young VA Medical Center (Bay Pines) 
5.2.2
Figure 69: C.W. Bill Young VAMC Campus Map 
The Bay Pines VA Healthcare System is a level 1a, tertiary care facility headquartered in Bay 
Pines, FL.  Originally opened in 1933, the main medical center is located on 337 acres situated 
on the Gulf of Mexico approximately eight miles northwest of downtown Saint Petersburg, FL. 
Co-located on the medical center campus are a VA Regional Office and a National Cemetery.  
In 2013, the medical center was renamed in honor of the late U.S. Congressman C.W. “Bill” 
Young of Florida’s 13th District, a staunch supporter of Veterans and a frequent visitor to the 
facility.  Services include: inpatient acute care (general medicine/surgery, psychiatry, and 
rehabilitation); residential programs (community living center, hospice, palliative care, stress 
treatment, homeless Veterans and substance abuse treatment); primary care; extensive 
specialty care; outpatient surgical services; OEF/OIF/OND program (Polytrauma level III); 
home and community care; homeless Veterans care; women Veterans care; and various 
ancillary and support services.  Mental health services are available at all points of care.  The 
facility also offers education and research.  (Source:  VA Bay Pines Factsheet)

Overview
1.
The Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinics are located adjacent to each other on the first 
floor of the Medical Center with relatively easy access from the main entrance of the hospital, 
and from several secondary entrances.  The services share a common reception/waiting area; 
however, Speech Pathology does not have direct access to the waiting room.  ENT is adjacent 
to both clinics, which is beneficial due to service synergies.  
Facility Analysis 
This is an example of adjacent Audiology and Speech Pathology clinics located in a VAMC.  
Figure 70 illustrates the department’s relationship/proximity to other hospital services, patient 
and service circulation paths relative to ASPS, and location relative to service elevators.

 Audiology 
2.
The Audiology Clinic at this facility primarily serves outpatients; however, with an active TBI 
program and Emergency Room at the Medical Center, patients may be wheeled into the 
department on beds/gurneys, and providers regularly treat inpatients at the bedside in the CLC 
and ICU (VHA ASPS, Questionnaires, User Meetings, and Field Surveys, 2016-17).  The clinic 
performs full-service audiology assessments and treatments, including Comp & Pen exams, 
and balance testing.  The facility has four prefabricated Audiometric Examination Suites as well 
as two Office/Treatment spaces with single prefabricated booths inside.  Balance testing rooms 
include Vestibulography, Posturography, Rotary Chair, and ENG.  Group therapies and 
telemedicine are also offered at this location.   
Challenges include: 
• 
Booth Accessibility (threshold, door size) 
• 
Waiting area configuration (particularly for hearing impaired patients) 
• 
Lack of barrier (door) between waiting and clinical area 
• 
Lack of direct connection to Speech Pathology 
 Speech Pathology 
3.
The Speech Pathology suite is located in repurposed Urology space, and is not ideally 
configured for services performed.  About half of the patients are inpatients.  Providers perform 
diagnostics and treat patients with a wide range of conditions including neurological, cognitive, 
trachea/esophagus puncture, head/neck injuries, and stroke.  This clinic has a single Speech 
“Lab” where comprehensive speech and swallow diagnostics and treatments are performed.   
Challenges include: 
• 
Size and configuration of treatment spaces is insufficient/inadequate for functions 
• 
Lack of speech privacy 
• 
Lack of direct connection to Waiting/Reception 
• 
Storage for packaged instruments and supplies: insufficient space, in public hallway without 
appropriate temperature/humidity control 
• 
Inadequate space for handling scopes per required protocols

James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital 
5.2.3
Figure 80: James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital Campus Map 
Activated in 1972, the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital (JAHVH) is a tertiary care facility 
classified as a Clinical Referral Level 1 Facility.  JAHVH is a teaching hospital, providing a full 
range of patient care services with state-of-the-art technology as well as education and 
research. 
Comprehensive health care is provided through primary care, tertiary care, and long-term care 
in areas of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, spinal cord 
injury, neurology, oncology, dentistry, geriatrics, and extended care (Source: About VA 
Tampa).  A Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center and Spinal Cord Injury Unit are also located on 
this campus. 
Location: 
 
Tampa, Florida 
Opening Date:

 Overview 
1.
Both Audiology and Speech Pathology services are offered at the J.A. Haley VAMC; however, 
services are dispersed in several locations as follows: 
• 
Audiology and Speech Pathology clinic: 2nd Floor of the medical center 
• 
Audiology and Speech Pathology administrative space: several locations in the medical 
center 
• 
Speech Pathology Special Procedure Room: 1st Floor of the medical center 
• 
Dedicated Speech Therapy Offices, Group Therapy, Assistive Technology, and balance 
testing: second floor of the Polytrauma Center (refer to discussion in paragraph 5.2.3) 
• 
Offsite Audiology Clinic (N. 46th St.): approximately 2 miles from the medical Center (refer 
to discussion in paragraph 5.2.3) 
 Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic (Main Hospital) 
2.
The 3,300 SF Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic, located on the second floor, Wing 2A of 
the Medical Center has three sounds suites, a Speech Lab, an Audiology Tech space, and two 
Provider Office/Treatment spaces, including one for Speech Pathology.  One of the sound 
suites has been converted into an office.  The clinic is somewhat remote from vertical 
transportation and is located adjacent to the Chapel and Chaplain Offices, which is not an 
appropriate adjacency.  Challenges include: 
• 
Sound transmission between the Speech Lab and Chapel 
 Speech/voice analysis activities interfere with the quiet/meditative environment needed 
-
for Chaplain functions 
 Singing in the chapel creates background noise that interferes with voice analysis. 
-
• 
Waiting area is remote from the clinic entrance and there is a lack of direct visual 
connection between the waiting and reception areas.  
• 
Insufficient space for treatment functions. 
• 
Insufficient clinical support space, including clean supply storage, which requires 
temperature and humidity control.  
• 
Buffer/grinder workstation is located in a treatment space rather than a separate room 
where noise and dust might be better mitigated.  
• 
Audiology and Speech Pathology offices not collocated in this clinic creates administrative 
challenges. 
While this clinic has collocated Audiology and Speech space, this is an example of a facility 
where Audiology and Speech Pathology services are dispersed.

3.
A single Endoscopic Procedure Room is located directly adjacent to Sterile Processing on the 
first floor of the Main Hospital.  This room is used for speech and swallow tests (including 
videostroboscopy, digital swallow tests, fiberoptic endoscopic examination, laryngectomy, etc.).  
The room has a direct pass-through to Sterile Processing, which is helpful for scope 
processing.  The key challenge noted is lack of adjacency relative to other ASPS Clinic and 
office/administrative spaces.

noted during the site visits: 
• 
Lack of wayfinding to Speech Pathology  
• 
Lack of waiting area 
• 
Insufficient sound attenuation in Speech Therapy Office/Counseling Rooms (for both 
speech privacy and noise from corridor) 
• 
Door width too narrow at Assistive Technology spaces  
Assistive Technology spaces are unique rooms which require plenty of space for the 
movement of wheelchairs and stretchers, the flexible arrangement of training tables, staff work 
functions, and storage of equipment.

Figure 95: Satellite view, 14020 N. 46th St., Tampa, FL 
The North 46th Street facility is a two-story outpatient clinic building located in a commercial 
area with strip shopping centers and other business establishments approximately 2 miles from 
the J.A. Haley Hospital; there is shuttle service between the hospital and clinic.  Facility access 
is via a fairly busy 4-lane road through an adjacent parking lot.  According to staff, the 
dedicated clinic parking lot becomes full during peak hours.

 Overview 
1.
The clinic houses Audiology on the first floor and Compensation and Pension on the 2nd Floor.  
The reception/waiting area for Audiology is immediately adjacent to the building 
entrance/vestibule.  The elevator to the second floor is opposite the building entry.  According 
to staff, the waiting area often becomes crowded due to lack of signage and wayfinding to 
services on the second floor. 
Facility Analysis  
As an offsite Audiology clinic without Speech Pathology, this facility is an example of 
segregated services.  There are numerous challenges associated with this model for both 
patients and caregivers. 
 Audiology Services 
2.
The Audiology Clinic at this location accommodates a variety of functions/services in the 
following rooms: 
• 
Eight Audiometric Examination Suites (sound suites) 
• 
Seven Audiologist Office/Treatment Rooms 
• 
Three Audiology Technician Office/Treatment Rooms 
• 
One Resident Collaboration Room 
• 
Vestibulography/Electrophysiology Room 
• 
Rotary Chair Room 
• 
Cochlear Implant Mapping 
• 
Conference Room/Classroom-doubles as a Group Room 
The sound suites accommodate a variety of hearing assessments, including Comp & Pen 
exams.  Proximity to the Comp & Pen Clinic is beneficial at this location.  Cochlear implant 
mapping is a unique function offered at only a few facilities in the country; it is used to train 
patients who have recently received cochlear implants and are learning to hear for the first 
time.  The proximity of Audiology Office/Treatment Rooms to the sound suites (across the hall) 
is beneficial for handwashing and staff convenience.  Challenges at this facility include: 
• 
Open access policy exacerbates crowding in the waiting room 
• 
Offsite facility without medical personnel and security necessitates dialing 911 in case of 
emergencies 
• 
Offsite facility without food/vending  
• 
Storage in corridor lacks security 
• 
Dim lighting in prefabricated sound booths

Overview
1.
The Orlando VAMC consists of two towers located on the opposite sides of two parking 
garages, connected by a central atrium/healing garden.  Hospital areas (inpatient, diagnostic, 
and treatment services) are located in the south tower; clinics and outpatient services are in the 
north tower.  In the north tower, various clinics, including the Audiology and Speech Clinic are 
located on the first floor along a front-loading concourse, which connects reception/waiting 
areas for each clinic.  The Audiology and Speech Clinic is located at the far end of the 
northeast wing on the first floor.  
Orlando outpatient clinics have an open access policy, which allows patients to come in without 
scheduling an appointment.  
Facility Analysis 
This facility is an example of collocated Audiology and Speech Pathology clinics at a Medical 
Center.  The diagram illustrates the department’s relationship/proximity to other hospital and 
outpatient services, patient and service circulation paths relative to ASPS, and location relative 
to vertical transportation, including service elevators.  Although not illustrated in the diagram, 
ENT is located in the south tower on the second floor near Surgery.  This was noted by 
clinicians to be an inconvenience for ASPS staff and patients.

 Audiology & Speech Pathology 
2.
The Orlando VAMC Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic is approximately 12,000 SF, with 
approximately 800 SF of dedicated Speech Pathology space.  Audiology and Speech patient 
care areas are collocated along with shared clinical and administrative support space.  
Although each service is unique, it was acknowledged during interviews and surveys that 
collocation is the optimum and preferred functional relationship for Audiology and Speech 
Pathology.  
The functional layout of the Audiology and Speech Clinic incorporates a racetrack 
organization/circulation loop with Reception/Waiting at the front, key office/treatment rooms at 
the sides/perimeter, and staff/administrative spaces along the back.  Key diagnostic and 
treatment functions, including 10 sound suites, and balance testing rooms form a block of 
space in the center; several Audiology Tech rooms, and a Triage Room are located in the front 
of the clinic to facilitate turnaround for routine activities and walk-in patients.  Speech Pathology 
functions are grouped on the east side.  Figure 111 illustrates the functional organization of the 
Orlando VAMC Audiology and Speech Clinic.

The Orlando VAMC Audiology and Speech Clinic is a modern, state-of-the art facility however, 
there were challenges noted during the site visit, interviews, and survey: 
• 
Insufficient seating in the concourse waiting area causes patients to wander to adjacent 
waiting areas where there is no direct visualization 
• 
Inadequate signage/wayfinding to service 
• 
Lack of soiled holding-scope transport carts are stored in the Hearing Aid Lab 
• 
Lack of dedicated resident work/collaboration space 
• 
Arrangement of doors on the prefabricated sound suites may block the egress corridor 
when open at the same time 
• 
Vestibular and Rotary Chair rooms are too narrow 
• 
Functional relationship between sound suites and office/treatment spaces at the perimeter 
• 
Administrative work area behind the reception desk is underutilized 
• 
Full height windows along the perimeter present functional issues relative to equipment 
placement, privacy, and daylight control (glare)

Washington, DC VA Medical Center 
5.2.7
Figure 113: Washington, DC VAMC Main Entrance 
The Washington DC VA Medical Center, located within sight of the Nation’s Capital, is the only 
health care system that specifically provides care to Veterans.  Offering tertiary care in a 
Complexity Level 1A hospital allows staff to provide comprehensive primary and specialty care 
in medicine, surgery, neurology, and psychiatry.  The Medical Center has 175 acute care beds, 
30 Psychosocial Residential Rehabilitation Treatment beds, and a 20-suite Fisher House.  The 
Medical Center is also home to an adjacent 120-bed Community Living Center which provides 
Veterans with geriatric long-term care, hospice, and palliative care (Source: About Washington, 
DC VAMC). 
Location: 
 
Washington, DC 
Department Area: 
 
10,275 sf 
 Overview 
1.
The Audiology and Speech Clinic is located on the first floor of Building 6 on the east side of 
the multi-story DC VAMC.  It is adjacent to other outpatient services, including the Dental Clinic 
and Renal Care Center.  Patients may access the clinic either via the main entrance or the 
Building 6 entrance, adjacent to Parking Lot 1.  Clinicians consider the clinic to be well placed 
on the VAMC campus, although wayfinding from the main entrance lobby is indirect and 
challenging due to distance.  
The facility has always had an open access policy (accepts unscheduled/walk-in patients), and 
is open on some Saturdays.

Facility Analysis 
This facility is an example of collocated Audiology and Speech Pathology services at a Medical 
Center; however, there is also dedicated Audiology and Speech Pathology space located on 
several specialty units of the Medical Center.  Audiology has dedicated space for cerumen 
management in the Community Living Center, and Speech Pathology has dedicated Speech 
Therapy Office/Treatment Rooms in the Comprehensive Nursing and Rehabilitation Center on 
the 2nd Floor.  Audiologists and Speech Pathologists serve as part of the interdisciplinary care 
teams for those services.  The proximity of the clinic to vertical transportation facilitates 
clinician access to other related services and inpatient units, including ENT on the 2nd Floor.  
Inpatients on beds/stretchers are also occasionally brought into the clinic.

2.
The D.C VAMC Audiology and Speech Pathology Clinic is approximately 10,275 SF, Audiology 
functions occupy most of the real estate, with approximately  9,857 SF, including shared 
Conference/Break Room and Resident/Trainee space; Speech Pathology has approximately 
411 SF, including the Service Chief Office/Consult Room.  
The functional layout of the Audiology and Speech Clinic is in an L-shape configuration due to 
existing space constraints; however, the main “wing” has sufficient width to accommodate a 
circulation loop.  The entry/reception area is accessible via a sliding glass doorway at the 
“elbow”.  Provider office/treatment spaces and the conference/break room are located along 
the perimeter/exterior wall, while sound suites and key treatment spaces are located in interior 
blocks of space.  Key diagnostic treatment functions include:

The D.C. VAMC Audiology and Speech Clinic is a modern, state-of-the art facility.  Treatment 
spaces, including Office/Treatment Rooms are, in general, sufficiently sized for their function.  
The corridors have sufficient width.  Offset doors on the prefabricated sound suites, which open 
into the corridor, do not pose the problem these doors cause in Orlando.  Additional features 
not observed in other facilities visited include: 
• 
Carpet tile in the corridor helps with sound attenuation for this service and creates a quiet 
atmosphere 

Audiology and Speech Pathology Design Guide  
November 2017 
 
 
 
 
Page   5-40 
• 
Handrails in the corridor benefit the patient population served 
• 
Combined Rotary Chair/VNG Room minimizes transfer of patients between various balance 
testing activities 
• 
Sinks in all provider office/treatment spaces 
• 
Adjustable height desks/tables at all provider workstations (including in sound suites) 
The prefabricated sound suites were typically spacious and barrier-free (no thresholds).  All 
Office/Treatment spaces, the VNG/Rotary Chair room, and sound suites are carpeted.  
There were a few challenges noted during the site visit, interviews, and survey: 
• 
No patient or staff toilets in the clinic, or in the vicinity of the clinic.  This is a significant 
deficiency 
• 
Inadequate signage/wayfinding to service 
• 
Insufficient storage space 
• 
Insufficient space for equipment/room contents in some locations.  There were a few 
conflicts between the location of fixtures and equipment  
• 
Lack of daylight control (blinds) on clerestory windows causes glare and heat gain 
• 
Mechanical background noise from equipment directly above the space was a problem 
upon move-in (has been resolved) 
• 
Artwork in the sound booth/suites was removed after move-in 
While carpet in the corridor and other clinical spaces was noted to be a benefit, there was 
discussion relative to the need to balance sound attenuation considerations with others, such 
as wheeled traffic and infection control issues.  
One unique consideration noted by clinicians at this location includes the need to 
accommodate service dogs, including inside the sound suite.
