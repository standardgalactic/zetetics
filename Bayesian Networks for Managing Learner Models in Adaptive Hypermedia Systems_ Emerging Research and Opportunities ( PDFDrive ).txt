Preface
INTRODUCTION
Overview
The technological landscape of modern e-learning is dominated by so-called 
learning management systems. The latter, being powerful integrated systems, 
support a number of activities carried out by teachers and learners during 
the e-learning process. Teachers use e-learning systems to develop course 
notes and web-based activities to communicate with learners on one side, and 
monitor and classify their progress on the other. Learners use it for learning, 
communication and collaboration.
Adaptive e-learning systems often employ learner models. A learner 
model is an internal representation of the user’s properties through which the 
system is based in order to adapt to the needs of each user. Before this model 
can be used, it must be built. This process requires a lot of effort to collect 
the required information and ultimately generate a learner model. Thus, an 
adaptive e-learning system takes all the properties of adaptive systems. To 
meet the needs of the application in the field of e-learning, adaptive e-learning 
systems adapt the learning material using user templates.
The behavior of an adaptive system varies depending on the data from 
the learner model and the learner’s profile. Without knowing anything about 
the learner who uses the system, a system would behave in exactly the same 
way for all learners.
In general, the adaptation process can be described in three steps: the first 
is the collection of information about the user, the second, the processing of 
information to initialize the user’s model, finally, updating the model of the 
initialized user and its use to provide adequate adaptation. In the process of 
adaptation, it is possible to distinguish between two different characters: on 
the one hand, we have the learner or the student with his goal of acquiring 
vii

Preface
knowledge, on the other hand, the teacher. The goal of a teacher is the mediation 
of knowledge covered by a course to learners. Therefore, both points of view 
must be present in an e-Learning system.
The user model is an essential element in adaptive e-learning systems. 
The adaptation of an e-learning system primarily involves the selection and 
presentation of each successive teaching activity based on the full scope of 
the learner’s knowledge, the subject taught and other relevant characteristics 
of the course. All information about the learners is held in a learner model. 
As a result, it is used to modify the interaction between the system and the 
learner to meet the individual needs of the learner.
Problematic
In the context of learner modeling in adaptive hypermedia systems, the 
representation of all learner actions is a central concept. Although there 
are already approaches that provide some form of modeling in adaptive 
hypermedia, some problems remain unresolved. We were interested in the 
following main issues:
•	
There are various attempts to model the learner in different adaptive 
educational hypermedia; these are the static representations of this 
model, representations that are generally based on information given 
by the learner himself when he enters the system. This gives the end 
a static view of the learner model. The learner model is characterized 
by a dynamic aspect, the knowledge of the learner evolves in the same 
module, and its characteristics change during a learning situation. This 
requires a dynamic vision for the management of this model;
•	
The learner model behaves in two broad areas, the specific information 
domain that represents learner-related data and is named in Adaptive 
Educational Hypermedia by the learner profile. And the independent 
information domain that represents learner-related data but also 
takes into consideration the environment and the type of learning 
situation. There are several studies during the last twenty years that 
aim at modeling the learner in adaptive hypermedia, but they always 
concern one domain while forgetting the other, which does not give a 
complete, dynamic and probabilistic vision of this one. model during 
its development during an educational journey;
viii

Preface
•	
The learner model is divided into three phases: data collection, 
initialization and updating of the developed model. There are several 
methods, techniques and models for each phase, but the problem lies 
in choosing the appropriate method that can handle uncertainty in all 
three phases. Are only one method and one technique sufficient for 
managing this model? Or is the solution in the combination of several 
methods to achieve a complete and formal management for adaptive 
educational hypermedia?
Faced with the problems mentioned above, the problem addressed here 
is reduced to specify the one hand, a dynamic modeling of learning a formal 
model for adaptive educational hypermedia systems and also to ensure that 
management of the model developed that addresses both information domains 
and includes the three phases of the learner modeling process.
Proposed Approaches
The approaches in this book and the work resulted reside in the modeling 
framework of the learner in an adaptive educational system. That is, the 
representation and specification of (largely defined) knowledge about the 
learner.
Different approaches were used to manage the learner model with multiple 
objectives, from assessing the learner’s knowledge to recognizing the plan 
followed in solving problems. In order to monitor the learner’s behavior in 
real time during the training, we need to adopt a dynamic modeling approach 
to learning model management.
Despite the various learner modeling attempts that are dynamic, we still 
struggle to achieve this goal. The proposed approaches give us just a static 
view of the learner model, but this model is still in development (the learner’s 
knowledge evolves in the same module), which is why a dynamic vision is 
essential. All actions of the learner in a learning situation are not limited to 
valid or invalid (true / false) actions, but are the actions that characterize his 
or her learning path and training. From this observation, we cannot represent 
each learner’s system information using relative data. We need to locate 
our work in a probabilistic context because of changes in the learner model 
during training.

Preface
The main hypothesis of this research insight is the use of Bayesian networks 
and methods as a probabilistic formalism for the management of the learner 
model in adaptive hypermedia. During all stages of the development of this 
model, since the initialization of the learner model based on the combination 
of Bayesian networks, and the method of stereotypes and during the update, 
in which we propose to integrate the networks Bayesians with the overlay 
model for complete probabilistic management of this model.
Features and Contributions
The idea developed in this book lies in the design and management of a valid 
learner model for all adaptive hypermedia systems. This management of all 
phases of development and updating of the learner model is based on Bayesian 
networks and multi-entity Bayesian networks to manage the dynamic aspect 
of this model. Thus, the contributions of our work are as follows:
•	
Presentation of a comparative study in which we presented the different 
functionalities and characteristics of a learner model in the adaptive 
educational systems.
•	
Presentation of a comparative study in which we presented the different 
methods and approaches for the management and modeling of the 
learner model in the adaptive educational systems and their level of 
intervention according to the components of the learner model and 
during the development process and model update.
•	
Presentation of a learner model for adaptive hypermedia based on 
e-learning standards and standards and using the unified modeling 
language use case diagram.
•	
Presentation of the transformation rules of use case diagrams into 
Bayesian networks, respecting all the existing modeling cases in the 
unified modeling language.
•	
Presentation of the Bayesian network of the learner model developed 
from the use case diagram presented, based on our transformation 
rules.
•	
Presentation of a dynamic and probabilistic learner model for adaptive 
hypermedia based on e-learning standards and standards and using

ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK
This book is divided into two major sections. The first section concerning 
the analysis of the state of the art, the first two chapters aim at presenting 
two comparative studies. The first study concerns the functionalities and 
composites of a learner model and its development in AHES. The second 
study aims at presenting the methods and models used to develop the learner 
model. Both studies present several arguments in which we have based our 
work for choosing the Bayesian methods as a probabilistic formalism to 
manage the learner model in AHES. The second section, composed of five 
chapters. In each chapter we present the process that we have used to develop 
a dynamic learner model in AHES.
Chapter 1: A Comparative Study of the Functionalities 
and Characteristics of a Learner Model in 
Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
This chapter will cover the description of the learner model and adaptive 
e-Learning systems. We will begin by presenting the learner model in Adaptive 
Hypermedia Educational Systems (AHES), its main role and categories 
that will form the context of this chapter. The focus then will shift to the 
study of the main functionalities of the learner model. We will divide these 
functionalities into six categories and we will present a study in 10 different 
hypermedia to conclude in which functionalities they’re based. Then, we 
will put emphasis on the different phases to develop and model the learner 
model in adaptive educational hypermedia systems, and illustrate the range of 
application of each functionalities and aspect and it focus area. We aim in this 
paper at presenting a comparative study of each aspect and functionalities of 
the learner model in different adaptive educational systems, and at showing 
their level/degree of intervention in relation with the components of the 
learner model and development process.
xi

Preface
Chapter 2: A Comparative Study of the Modeling 
techniques and Models of a Learner Model in 
Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
In this chapter, we will come back to the process of developing the learner 
model and the different types of its components and content. Then, we will 
present the different methods and approaches of management and modeling of 
the learner model in the adaptive educational systems and this by illustrating 
the field of use of each of these methods as well as its field of intervention. 
Finally we will present a comparative study of these modeling methods and 
its level of intervention according to the components of the learner model 
and during the development process and the model update.
Chapter 3: Development of Bayesian Networks From 
Use Case Diagrams for Managing the Learner Model
The objective of this chapter will be to develop a Bayesian network since 
the unified modeling language (UML) in the objectives is to represent the 
learner model. In this chapter, we will try to offer a combination of these 
two approaches, starting with specifying the transformation rules on which 
we have based our work. We will then demonstrate how to transform use 
case diagrams into a Bayesian network based on these rules. Finally, we will 
present the formal structure for this consideration.
Chapter 4: A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks 
in Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems
The objective of this chapter will be to use Bayesian networks as a probabilistic 
formalism to solve the problem of managing and dynamically updating the 
learner model. We will begin by presenting the meta-model of the learner 
model that we used as a reference to develop our use case diagram of the 
learner model. Then we will move on to the specifics of the transformation 
rules of our use case diagram to a Bayesian network based on these rules. 
Finally, we will present experiments to test our hypothesis by testing all the 
nodes of our developed Bayesian network.
xii

Preface
Chapter 5: The Determination of Learning Styles 
in a Learner Model Using the Combination of 
Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
In this chapter, we will first see the concepts and definitions of the learner 
model and the learning styles on which our work will be based. Next, we 
will define the Bayesian networks and the overlay model. Once done, we 
will focus on the combination rules from which we have based our work to 
integrate Bayesian networks with the overlay model. We will then demonstrate, 
using an example of a learning situation, the validity of this combination. 
Finally, we will describe a formal structure for defining each learning style 
for a learning situation.
Chapter 6: The Combination of Bayesian Networks 
and Stereotypes to Initialize the Learner Model in 
Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems
In this chapter, we will explain our approach to the initialization of the 
learner model based on a combination of stereotyping method and Bayesian 
networks, specifying the field of intervention of each method and these 
expected results. Finally, and with the objective of dismantling the validity 
of our hypothesis, we will present the experiments and the tests carried out. 
The results obtained following these experiments presented in this work will 
represent arguments in favor of our hypothesis. This realized combination 
also promotes its reuse in the step of updating the learner model in different 
adaptive educational hypermedia systems.
Chapter 7: A Learner Model Based on Multi-
Entity Bayesian Networks in Adaptive 
Hypermedia Educational Systems
In this last chapter of our manuscript, we will present our probabilistic learner 
model based on multi-entity Bayesian networks. We will return to begin with 
the learner model that we modeled in the beginning using the Unified Modeling 
Language Use Case Diagram, and then introduce the Bayesian network of the 
learner model that we developed. Then, we will explain the approach followed 
in this chapter for modeling the learner model with Bayesian multi-entity 
networks, starting with the presentation of MEBNs and their composition, 
xiii

Preface
explaining the notions of fragments and MTheories. Finally, and in order to 
demonstrate the validity of our hypothesis; we will present the fragments of 
each node of our network, these random variables, and then we will perceive 
our multi-entity Bayesian network in a complete way.
CONCLUSION
The approach that we followed in this research insight is marked initially 
by the modeling of the learner model in three levels: we started with the 
conceptual level of modeling with the unified modeling language, followed 
by the modeling of the model based on Bayesian networks to be able to lead 
to probabilistic modeling in the three phases of learner modeling. Finally, 
we have proposed in this last chapter a dynamic and probabilistic modeling 
of this model using multi-entity Bayesian networks.
This approach is considered very useful for the learner model, especially 
in the case of a large number of data stored in the system. The transformation 
of the nodes for fragments gives us the possibility of a separate management 
of the data of each fragment, keeping at the same time all types of relations 
of each fragment with the other fragments by using the random variables 
which exist in several fragments within an m-theory of the learner model.
We presented, firstly, a conceptual modeling of the learner, based on an 
e-learning meta-model of adaptive hypermedia. Using the use case diagram 
of the unified modeling language, we have developed based on this diagram, 
the Bayesian network that represents the learner model through specific 
transformation rules. A transformation based on our work of development 
of Bayesian networks since the unified modeling language presented in the 
second chapter.
We then presented a combination of the overlay model with Bayesian 
networks for domain-specific information management. We took as examples 
the learning styles to test this combination, testing our Bayesian network 
of learner model with precise metrics. And for the initialization stage of 
the learner model, we have based our hypothesis on the combination of the 
stereotype method to create a learner profile since the collection of independent 
information about the learner, and the Bayesian networks that represent the 
initial tests that the learner must take before he enters a learning situation in 
adaptive hypermedia.
xiv

Preface
The elaborate learner model could be reused and adapted for other 
environments in various domains while using an engineering approach, which 
provides a better framework for design. The choice of Bayesian multi-entity 
networks as formalism to manage the uncertainty of this model becomes more 
beneficial especially for environments with many examples. The model could 
also help the teacher to better adapt his teaching to the learner. Nevertheless, 
learner participation largely influences the effect of using our model.

ABSTRACT
Today’s adaptive hypermedia systems are putting more and more emphasis on 
the intelligence of the system. One of the most important factors in assessing 
the quality and usability of the system is the level to meet the needs of the 
user, the learner. So, the learner model, the component that backs up and 
manages learner information, becomes more important. The learner model is 
an essential component for adaptive e-learning systems. The term adaptation 
in e-learning systems involves the selection and manner of presentation of 
each learning activity as a function that examines the entity of knowledge, 
skills, and other information given by each subject taught. The chapter aims 
at studying the functionalities of the learner model in different adaptive 
hypermedia educational systems in the three stages of developing and 
managing this model. The authors present in this comparative study a full 
analysis of the learner model used in 10 major hypermedia to come up with 
most appropriate method to treat the dynamic aspect of this model.

A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
INTRODUCTION
In general, the adaptation process can be described in three steps: retrieving 
user information, processing information to initialize the user model, and 
updating the initialized user model; finally, the use of the user model to 
provide the adaptation. In this chapter, we will only use the user’s model 
term, which is used because the user profile is simply considered the process 
of collecting raw data from the user (Kobsa, 1993)
In the process of adaptation, it is possible to distinguish between two 
different characters. At the beginning, the learner or student with his goal of 
acquiring knowledge, second: the teacher. The goal of a teacher is to mediate 
the knowledge covered by a course to learners. Therefore, both points of view 
must be present in an e-Learning system (Brusilovsky, 2000)
To be able to adapt the presentation of learning and navigation content to 
the needs of the user, a user model is needed, including objectives or tasks, 
knowledge, pre-requisites and user preferences. These user properties are used 
to make adaptive decisions by adaptive hypermedia systems. In addition, the 
user’s recent templates also store the interests and individual traits.
In this chapter, we will begin by presenting the learner model in Adaptive 
Hypermedia Educational Systems (AHES), its main role and categories that 
will form the context of this chapter. The focus then will shift to the study of the 
main functionalities of the learner model. We will divide these functionalities 
into six categories and we will present a study in 10 different hypermedias to 
conclude in which functionalities they’re based. Then, we will put emphasis 
on the different phases to develop and model the learner model in adaptive 
educational hypermedia systems, and illustrate the range of application of 
each functionalities and aspect and it focus area. We aim in this chapter 
at presenting a comparative study of each aspect and functionalities of the 
learner model in different adaptive educational systems, and at showing their 
level/degree of intervention in relation with the components of the learner 
model and development process.

A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
LEARNER MODEL IN ADAPTIVE HYPERMEDIA 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS
In this section, we will present the categories of a learner model in adaptive 
hypermedia educational systems. And then will present the main functionalities 
of the learner model, and a comparative analysis of their existence in 10 
existing hypermedia.
The Categories of a Learner Model in AHES
Today’s AHES are putting more and more emphasis on the intelligence of 
the system. One of the most important factors in assessing the quality and 
usability of the system is the level to meet the needs of the user, the learner. 
So the learner model, the component that backs up and manages learner 
information, becomes more important.
A Learner model is one of the major components of an AHES. It allows 
to keep information about the learner, for example his level of knowledge on 
a given subject (performance), his frequent errors / misunderstandings, his 
psychological characteristics, etc. A learner model can be defined as a set of 
structured information about the learning process, and this structure contains 
values about the characteristics of the learner. It provides the necessary data 
for the other modules in order to adapt the teaching to the learner. (Han, 
2003; Zhou et al., 1999)
Figure 1 represents the different categories of a learner model existing 
in different AHES. Each learner model must belong to one or more of these 
main categories:
•	
Dynamic Model: This category of learner model accumulates and 
records in real time the information about the learner. This information 
could be modified or updated dynamically depending on the interaction 
between the learner and the system. E.g. system visits, answers to 
questions, etc. As a result, the system actively adapts the teaching to the 
learners; in particular it supports the dynamic navigation in quantity of 
educational materials.
•	
Cognitive model: The cognitive model means that the cognitive 
aspects of the learner are considered in modeling. For example, the 
principles of cognitive psychology are adapted and incorporated in the 
modeling, to follow the state of the memory of the learner, in order to 

4
A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
adapt pedagogical strategies to the needs of the learner among others 
by offering him relevant contents to be revised at the appropriate time. 
Many researchers have applied cognitive theories to modeling in a 
variety of ways. In addition, cognitive characteristics of the learner, 
for example, the attitude of learning, the time that a fact remains in 
the memory, the capacity of memory, are frequently included in this 
category of a learner model.
•	
Model with contempt: In this category, the learner model mainly 
retains the errors or the frequent misunderstandings of the learners 
and also the causes or explanations of these errors. Normally, this list 
of errors is a result of empirical studies involving many students and 
tutors in concrete cases in schools. This type of model is often used 
to simulate a learner’s problem-solving process to diagnose possible 
errors. In addition, the misunderstanding model could be used for 
the automatic construction of exercises, for example in the case of 
multiple-choice questions, to automatically produce the most common 
erroneous answers given by students.
•	
Open / Interactive Model: This new approach to learner modeling 
allows learners to have some control over diagnostic inspection and 
model modification. The model is built jointly by the system and the 
learner. The system then accumulates its own points of view and those 
of the learner on the knowledge of the learner. The open model is used 
Figure 1. The categories of a learner model in AHES

5
A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
to encourage learners to reflect on their learning, as well as for tutors to 
tailor instruction to the individual or group. The openness of the model 
could also make it easier for learners to compare their own progress 
over time or their own progress with peers in the same group or other 
groups.
•	
Collaborative model: This model is used in the context of collaborative 
learning. Collaborative learning is a new paradigm that broadens a 
classical AHES by involving concepts of collaboration. The success of 
a student could help the success of other members of the group. The 
learner could also search for an online peer, the system that matches 
students according to relevant attributes, to solve a problem. The 
collaborative model is also useful for finding peers who could or would 
like to receive feedback about some aspects of their work.
•	
Uncertain Model: This category of learner model focuses on dealing 
with the uncertainty of the learner’s knowledge. Descriptions of 
knowledge or levels of knowledge are often inaccurate in the actual 
situation. Knowledge modeling can represent, train and update this 
uncertain knowledge. The treatment of uncertainty could also help 
to reach certain conclusions about learner knowledge or pedagogical 
strategies, based on incomplete information.
•	
Distributed Model: This learner model is often used in the distributed 
environment. There is no monolithic model associated with each student. 
Knowledge about a specific student is distributed among agents who 
communicate with that student. Modeling is a process of assembling 
and summarizing fragmented learner information from potentially 
diverse sources. This information could be raw data recorded by an 
application, partially calculated models, and learner options recorded 
by a tutor or peers, or a history of the learner’s actions.
We briefly presented the characteristics and usefulness of the different 
categories of learner model. It is difficult to attribute rigid and definitive 
boundaries to these categories. Some concrete learner models have several 
characteristics, that is, they belong to several different categories. We could 
find in some situations, the same learner model in some AHES is in the same 
time a dynamic, distributed and collaborative model. To determine the most 
appropriate learner model category, one needs to thoroughly analyze the 
practical needs and real situations. And to achieve this purpose, we will try 
to conduct this comparative study with 10 different AHES.

The Existing Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
In this study to comprehend the main functionalities of a learner model in 
adaptive hypermedia educational systems, we have chosen 10 AHES from 
different domains of intervention. We will compare each one of them based on 
some well defined metrics to define a proper path to construct and initialize 
a learner model using a combination of methods/model.
•	
AHA!, the “Adaptive Hypermedia Architecture”, was originally 
developed to support an on-line course with some user guidance 
through conditional (extra) explanations and conditional link hiding. 
It consists of a set of concepts, some of which are linked to pages or 
objects (or fragments). Concepts can be used to represent topics of the 
application domain. (De Bra et al., 2003)
•	
The ADAPTWEB environment is an adaptive hypermedia system 
providing the same content adapted to different students groups. 
ADAPTWEB is an open source environment in operation in different 
universities. (Warpechowski et al., 2004)
•	
AVANTI is a system designed for a range of users with different needs. 
This system combines in the stages of data collection and initialization 
of the learner model stereotypes and superposition method to create 
initial assumptions, and to maintain the knowledge of the user. (Anouar 
Tadlaoui et al., 2016)
•	
ANATOM-TUTOR Developed for teaching anatomy of the brain at 
university level, ANATOM-TUTOR’s hypertext component makes use 
of a user model to adapt hypertext lessons at both the link and the text 
level. Hypertext is one of three learning modes offered by ANATOM-
TUTOR. (Beaumont, 1994)
•	
The AHM system, in which the adaptation depends on the level of 
expertise on the concepts of the field know the system is a subset of all 
the user’s domain concepts. (Hardman, 1997)
•	
The ELM-ART system is an Adaptive distance Tutor system, which 
support learning Lisp programming language. It uses different 
techniques for initializing and updating its learning model: overlay 
model, the complex machine learning methods and Bayesian networks 
to represent episodic learning model. (Weber et al., 2001)
•	
INSPIRE is an adaptive hypermedia that emphasizes the fact that 
learners perceive and process information in very different ways, 

7
A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
and integrates ideas from theories of instructional design and 
learning styles. INSPIRE, throughout its interaction with the learner, 
dynamically generates learner-tailored lessons that gradually lead to 
the accomplishment of learner’s learning goals. (Papanikolaou et al., 
2003)
•	
In HYPERADAPT, a specialized approach utilizing an aspect-
oriented programming is used. This hypermedia places the adaptivity 
into separate modules called adaptation aspects. The aspects are not 
applied on a model level, but on XML documents. (Niederhausen et 
al., 2009)
•	
HYNECOS is adaptive hypermedia that demonstrates the applicability 
of the Hypertext Design Model HDM for design of hypertext-based 
information systems from relational databases. HYNECOS contains 
textual and graphical data about patients (administrative data, reports, 
x-rays etc.), hospital staff (names, telephones and shift-information 
about all staff members), a medical encyclopedia (diseases, treatments, 
and prognosis) and the location of the wards (room-plans, beds, 
occupancy etc.). (Schwabe et al., 1990)
•	
The METADOC system is an adaptive hypermedia mainly used 
in medicine, it’s not only has hypertext capabilities but also has 
knowledge about the documents it represents. This knowledge enables 
the document to modify its level of presentation to suit the user. 
METADOC builds and dynamically maintains a user model for each 
reader. (Boyle et al., 1998)
The Fonctionalites of a Learner Model in Existing AHES
The intelligence of an AHES is mainly attributed to its ability to adapt to 
a specific learner during the teaching process; adaptation depends on the 
individual learner’s knowledge of the subject taught and other relevant 
characteristics of the learner; relevant knowledge and information of the 
learner is often managed in a learner model. (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2014; 
Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2015)
The learner model category plays an important role in the implementation 
of intelligence and personalization of AHES. Specifically, a learner model can 
help personalize learning, assess learner knowledge, track learner progress, etc.
In Table 1, we identified six essential functionalities of a learner model: 
Personalizing learning, assessment of the learner’s knowledge, follow-up and

presentation of progress and actions of the learner, search for appropriate peers 
to get help, management of the learner information and automatic construction 
of exercises. And we will compare the existence of these functionalities in 
the AHES we took into our comparative study.
According to this table, we can conclude that two features are very 
common. Systems provide personalized learning by adapting teaching to 
the needs of the learner, giving relevant advice. Planning own learning 
activities, etc. Appropriate exams or tests are built according to the learner’s 
performance. In addition, adaptive navigation has long been a technique 
used to achieve adaptation of learning. More specifically, to adapt teaching, 
teaching materials can be presented according to the level of knowledge 
and according to the learner’s personal preference. Educational planning 
can also be organized according to the learner’s knowledge, psychological 
characteristics or preferences. Pedagogical strategies can be selected according 
to the psychological characteristics and the learner’s performance.
Learner model is also an essential component in assessing the learner’s 
knowledge. For example, learner responses can be analyzed to infer beliefs, in 
other words, correct, erroneous, or incomplete knowledge. We can diagnose 
errors or misunderstandings of the learner according to the frequent mistakes 
of this learner and those of many students. Information on these errors is 
maintained in the learner model. Students’ knowledge can be accessed from a 
conversation between the system and the learner. This diagnostic dialogue can 
be planned according to the learner’s beliefs. From the results of the diagnosis, 
the explanations of the errors are adapted to each student according to his. In 
some cases, when there are ambiguities about the explanations, the learner’s 
error history can be consulted to determine the appropriate explanations.
The other functionalities are also important and interesting even if they 
are present in few systems, for example: the monitoring of the progress of 
the learner, the automatic construction of exercises, etc. The presentation 
and comparison of the student’s progress encourages the student to become 
more active. The automatic (or semi-automatic) construction of exercises 
allows tutors to increase their effectiveness. Peer research is very useful in 
collaborative models.
The majority of systems have two or more features at the same time, 
especially the two essential features of personalization of learning and 
assessment of learner knowledge, for example, AHM, AHA!, ANATOM-
TUTOR, etc. Some systems focus on a single feature, which presents a 
mechanism for representing and maintaining the learner’s actions by noting 
temporal aspects, in order to provide the learner with an overview of his or 

10
A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
her model (long-term and short-term). This feature is important for getting 
relevant learner information and can be useful for other features, including 
learning adaptation and ambiguities resolution in diagnosing learner errors 
or misunderstandings.
The Composition of a Learner Model in Existing AHES
Based on the survey we have presented in our previous work (Anouar 
Tadlaoui et al., 2016), we could resume the composition of learner models 
in different AHES into four major categories: characteristics of the learner, 
learning state, Learner Knowledge and Interactions between the system and 
the learner (Kay, 2000)
•	
Characteristics of the Learner: This category includes the learner’s 
general or psychological characteristics, such as his or her learning 
purpose, type of learning, learning style preferences, computer 
experiences, level of learning concentration, the desired level of 
detail, availability, etc. The level of concentration could be inferred 
according to its interactions with the system, for example the time it is 
no longer active in the system. From this information, we can specify 
the anticipated needs of the learner.
•	
Learning State: Current or past states are classified in this category. 
More specifically, this type of model contains the learning plan, the 
program followed, the learning history, etc. This information is then 
used to analyze and maintain the learner’s situation.
•	
Interactions Between the System and the Learner: This is one of the 
key categories of learner information. Interactions between the system 
and the learner are recorded and updated. At the appropriate time, the 
system infers the learner’s knowledge or learning status according to 
the recorded data. These interactions can be divided into two sub-
categories: system visits and answers to questions. Visits include visits 
to educational content, such as the number of visits to the same unit, 
the duration of the same visit, the type of content, etc. The number of 
examples or aids requested is also recorded. Then the answers include 
the correct answers and the wrong answers. In fact, the system does not 
keep the answers; instead it records the corresponding parameters, for 
example the number of errors, the frequency of a particular error, the 
more frequent errors, the number of tests, etc.

11
A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
•	
Learner Knowledge: This is another important category. The data or 
information in the previous categories is used to infer the learner’s 
knowledge to provide a personalized learning. In this category, there 
may be the learner’s level of knowledge, exam or test scores, chess 
patterns, learner’s beliefs and degrees of correction, explanations 
of errors/misunderstandings, knowledge of prerequisite concepts, 
knowledge of sub-domains, knowledge to be validated, knowledge 
acquired, etc.
Figure 2 shows the proportion of the use of each category in AHES. It is 
impossible and not necessary to build a complete learner model with all the 
elements mentioned, because it requires too many resources. Most of the 
proposed learner models contain only a few parts of these four categories, 
especially the last two. Although researchers place less emphasis on learning 
status, it is useful for personalizing learning by considering the learner’s 
learning path and progress.
We can also classify this information, as we presented in previous work 
(Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2016) into two groups according to their relationship 
to the domain: domain-independent or domain-specific. The personal data and 
the characteristics of the learner are information independent of the field. They 
Figure 2. The composition of a learner model in AHES

12
A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
are relatively static. Normally the data is provided by the students themselves 
by completing the forms or questionnaires. The learner could change some 
elements if necessary during the learning process. Few modifications are 
necessary to reuse them in different systems, in different domains. Most of 
the other three categories are domain specific. Some parameters are obtained 
directly by observing the actions of the learner. Some others are inferred from 
the first data. They are dynamic and automatically updated by the system.
DEVELOPMENT OF A LEARNER MODEL IN ADAPTIVE 
HYPERMEDIA EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS
After presenting the functionalities of the learner model in different AHES. We 
will present in this section of the chapter, the three phases of learner model’s 
development in AHES. We will begin by explaining the process of learner 
model development and then we will present a comparative study concerning 
the three phases of the development process according to 10 AHES.
The Process of Developing a Learner Model in AHES
Despite these various attempts to model the learning that is characterized 
by a dynamic aspect, we always find it difficult to achieve this goal. The 
proposed approaches give us just a static view of the learner model, but in 
practice this model is in full development (the learner knowledge is evolving 
in the same module) to a dynamic view. In order to monitor the behavior of 
the learner in real time during training, we must adopt a model for dynamic 
management of the learning model.
All actions of the learner in a learning situation are not limited to valid or 
invalid actions (true and false), but these actions are characterized according 
to the learner learning path during his training. From this observation, we 
cannot represent the information from the system of each learner as a relative 
data. This demands putting our work in a probabilistic context due to the 
changes in the learner model during training (Koch, 2000)
Figure 3 represents the stages of development of a model of the learner. 
In the data collection phase, they are three major steps: the collection of data 
about the user, the collection of data about the system and creating a learner 
profile based on this initial data collected.

13
A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
In the initialization stage of a learner model, the collected data undertakes 
a transformation process towards the model of the learner. This initialization 
process is realized through the implementation of several methods. The system 
affects the user to a specific stereotype according to the data collected. Then 
continue to collect data about the user all along his learning path using several 
methods like Bayesian networks or machine learning.
The information that is used to update the learner model can be retrieved, 
implicitly or explicitly from various sources of information. Among the 
sources of information, we find the information currently stored in the learner 
model. This information can be used as a source for which we derive new 
information or make changes to the alleged information. Furthermore, the 
information currently stored in the other system components may be useful.
The Construction of a Learner Model in Existing AHES
Table 2 represents a comparative between these different aspects of the 
construction of a learner model in AHES. We could notice that mainly all the 
AHES dispose of a system for data composition and representation. The main 
difference between this AHES is the methods used to collect data; we could 
notice that the old AHES based its data collection in general construction 
methods, and the specific AHES used more individual methods to extract 
precise data about the user.
The construction of an MA concerns the determination of the composition 
and structure of a learner model. For example, what categories of information 
should be included in the learner model? What concrete elements are needed? 
And what are the links of these elements between them? We must also

consider how to effectively represent this structure and these elements. Some 
authors concretely present the use of certain formalisms of representation. 
The process or method of construction indicates how to organize and acquire 
this information and knowledge. For example, how to extract knowledge 
from empirical studies.
The Inisialisation of a Learner Model in Existing AHES
The initialization of a learner model is a fairly important step in the development 
process. Researchers have exploited four ways to initialize a learner model: 
through questionnaires or pre-tests, by stereotypes, by the previous cases 
and by the default values. Among them, stereotypes are most often used. 
Stereotypes represent the knowledge and characteristics of typical user classes. 
So each student is assigned to one of the predefined classes (ie stereotypes). 
The major task of initialization is to select the appropriate stereotype for a 
learner. The questionnaires are practical and relatively easy to implement. 
Therefore, they are used in several systems.
Table 3 represents a comparative between these different aspects of the 
initialization of a learner model in AHES.
Sometimes, to know the initial level of knowledge of the learner, the 
learner is asked to do a simple test before starting his apprenticeship. The 
result of the test could be used to initialize some learner model values, or to 
show the progress of learning. Using previous cases to initialize the model is 
an interesting method. Previous experiences (models) of individual students 
or groups are used as stereotypes for future learners. Default values ​are used 
frequently in traditional systems. The initial values ​are assigned and then 
adjusted as appropriate in the treatment process.
The Update and Management of a 
Learner Model in Existing AHES
The methods and steps of a learner model management are related to the 
appropriate times to update the data or knowledge stored in the models. The 
learner model maintenance mechanism is specific to everyone because it has 
a close relationship with many aspects of the model, such as its structure, 
mode of representation, use, and so on.
Table 4 represents a comparative between these different aspects of the 
update and management of a learner model in AHES.

A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
Some parameters in the category of personal data are used to identify the 
learner, for example the name, the user name or login name, the email, etc. 
Some personal data (eg age, experiences, gender, training, etc.) and some 
characteristics of the learner (learning purpose, type / style of learning, 
computer experiences, level concentration, preferences, etc.) are used to 
initialize the model, especially to select the appropriate stereotype for the 
learner. A stereotype represents the common characteristics of the learning 
style. Learning paths or activity plans could also be exploited to preserve the 
present or past states of the learner
The statistical parameters concerning the interaction between the learner 
and the system (the frequency of a specific error, the units visited more 
frequently, etc.) are the results of the calculation or reasoning based on 
certain visible parameters on the actions of the learner. the learner. They 
could also change some characteristics of the learner, including the level of 
concentration. Interaction parameters and characteristics are used to evaluate 
the learner’s knowledge. Conversely, the level of knowledge assessed could 
also influence / modify certain characteristics of the learner.
The Modeling Approches Used for Learner 
Modelling in Existing AHES
A learner model is a combination of all relevant data on the learner in relation 
to a learning environment. There are common types of information among 
learners’ models such as object domain information, goals, motivation, training 
and experience, cognitive skills, preferences and demographic training data.
To develop and manage the learner model, several methods/techniques 
have been used. Table 5 represents a comparative between these different 
modeling techniques and models used in modelling the learner in AHES.
DISCUSSION
Learner models can be used in very different ways, depending on the actions 
and characteristics of the learner in the system. Since there are different types 
of adaptive e-Learning systems, the applied learner models are different.
In many systems, the learner model may not be explicitly described as 
a simple functional module. It can be spread over several elements of the 
system. Thus, it is clearly visible what is connected to the model of the learner.

A Study of the Learner Model in Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems
Therefore, a learner model may not be available as an additional component 
but properties, which are related to a user model and are assigned to the 
long-term model user.
We could say, based on this study, that the learner model is an essential 
element in adaptive e-Learning systems. The adaptation of an e-Learning 
system primarily involves the selection and presentation of each successive 
teaching activity based on the full scope of the learner’s knowledge of the 
subject taught and other relevant characteristics of the subject. As a result, 
the learner model is used to change the interaction between the system and 
the student to meet the individual needs of the students.
A learner model must be built, initialized and updated. Initializing a learner 
model is an important topic, where an appropriate way to gather the requested 
information has to be found. In particular, the effort for the user during 
initialization should be considered as this process affects the accuracy and 
usability of the learner model and the entire system. To keep the information 
stored on the learner updated, the modification of learner information must 
be included in the learner template. After the information within a learner’s 
model is changed, the new information must be delivered. Delivery affects 
systems that use the learner model and should keep information consistent 
across all places where it is used.
CONCLUSION
An adaptive system needs information about the target to which it adapts. 
Since this target is most often adaptive to the learner of the adaptive system, 
a learner model is required. By using a learner model, an adaptive system can 
use this learner model in three different types of system actions. The system 
can interpret the actions of the learner differently regarding the features 
stored in the learner’s model. For example, users with dyslexia may have 
a particular problem with a few words. The system recognizes these typos 
and automatically corrects the entry. In the other direction, the actions of 
the machine or the output of the system can be adapted to meet the needs of 
the user, and finally, internal actions can be influenced by the information 
stored in the user’s model.
The information stored in a learner model varies between different models 
and depends on the adaptive e-learning system surrounded or often used. To

in a learner model. These agreements are represented by standards. There 
are several standards in the field of user modeling that we will describe in 
the next chapter.
As a conclusion, it is safe to say that the learner model plays an important 
role in most hypermedia system and adaptive educational hypermedia systems 
in particular. We have presented in previous work, a probabilistic approach 
to manage dynamically the learner model in AHES (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 
2014; Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2015) with an approach that can manage two 
types of independent and specific information of the domain of the learner, 
and that can be relevant to the three stages of the construction of the learner 
model. And we have also presented a process to combine the stereotypes 
method and Bayesian networks to initialize the learner model in AHES 
(Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2017; Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2018) in a probabilistic 
work frame to respond to the problematic of uncertainty in the learner model.

ABSTRACT
The main objective of the learner model is to modify the interaction between 
the system and the learner in a dynamic way to address the needs of each 
learner on an individual basis. To obtain a complete learner model, we need 
the proper techniques and methods to initialize it and update it. This chapter 
present a comparative study of different adaptive hypermedia systems and the 
methods and techniques used in with them. This study lies within the range 
of modeling the learner in adaptive educational system as a conceptual 
modeling of the learner. Although there are several methods that deal with 
the learner model, like stereotypes methods or learner profile, they are likely 
unable to handle the uncertainty embedded in the dynamic modeling of the 
learner. The chapter aims studies different models and approaches to model 
the learner in an adaptive educational system and comes up with the most 
appropriate method based on the dynamic aspect of this model.

Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
INTRODUCTION
The user module is an essential component for Adaptive e-Learning systems. 
The term adaptation in e-Learning systems involves the selection and manner 
of presentation of each learning activity as a function that examines the entity 
of knowledge, skills and other information given by each subject taught.
The main objective of learner model is to modify the interaction between 
the system and the learner in a dynamic way to address the needs of each 
learner on an individual basis. Generally, the adaptation process involves 
three major steps: Data collection about the user, processing the information 
gathered about the user to initialize the model of the learner and to use the 
initialized Learner model to adapt the system to the needs of each learner.
Its must be noted that in the process of adaptation, we must differentiate 
between two types of the user that must be taken into account in the e-learning 
systems. In hypermedia systems, there are two types of users: The student 
who enters the system to learn or develop his skills, and the teacher whose 
role is the transmission of knowledge to learners.
THE USER MODEL IN ADAPTIVE HYEPERMEDIA
The Architecture of Adaptive Hyeprmedia 
Educational Systems
In general, the architecture of Adaptive Hypermedia Educational Systems 
(AEHS) comprises two layers: the storage and implementation layer.
The storage layer is the main engine that controls adaptive process whose 
main tasks are:
•	
Initialization and update of the learner model
•	
The choice of the domain model concepts, learning resources by 
applying specific rules.
•	
Storing the learning resources, domain ontologies, the model of the 
learner, etc.

26
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
The execution Layer is responsible for the presentation of the adaptive 
learning material to the user and the observation of the user’s actions so as 
to update the learner model.
Figure 1 represents the architecture of AHES (Henze & Nejdl, 2004), the 
storage layer in this architecture has four models:
•	
Domain model structure of knowledge domain which is often referred 
to as a graph. Several researchers intend to build the domain model by 
using ontologies.
•	
Media Model contains learning resources and associated descriptive 
information (metadata).
•	
Adaptation model is the main component that gives effect to 
adaptation. It contains content and concepts selection rules. By applying 
these rules in content selection, it helps us choose the appropriate 
educational resources from the internal model. On the other hand, the 
concept selection rules are used to select the appropriate notions of the 
domain model. These rules must comply with a user model so that the 
selection becomes correct.
•	
User Model contains information and data about the user.

The Role of the User Model in Adaptation
According to Kay (2000), the user model can assist in the adaptation of the 
system in three major ways. Figure 2 indicates different uses of the user model 
during the interaction between the user and the system.
The first usage of the user model is represented by the user’s arrow towards 
the system; the fact which reflects the possible actions of the user with the 
interface such as writing through the keyboard, selection by using the mouse 
and audio / video inputs. In this phase of interaction the role of the user model 
is to interpret the information in the system. The above figure illustrate the 
way the user model supports or allow the system to clarify the user input when 
it is put in an ambiguous form by identifing the applications in areas such as 
natural language understanding, interepting command line and misspellings 
by dyslexic users or typing problems by users with mobility problems.
The second type of interaction is represented by the arrow from the system 
toward the user. In this phase The user model is used to modify and control 
the system and adjust the shares according to the preferences of the user. 
This method is used to adapt the system according to the user’s actions by 
adapting the content and its representation. For example, e-Learning systems 
can adapt their activities according to the knowledge’s field of the user based 
on learners information, and assign learning activities according to the level 
of each learner in a specific field. Adaptive hypermedia systems focus on 
adapting the navigation and content preferences according to the domain 
knowledge stored in the user model.
The third usage of the user model is concerns with the internal system 
actions. The user model assist the system to filter the information received 
before saving.
Figure 2. the role of the User Model in Adaptation

28
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
The combination of these three types of action is used in adaptive systems. 
concidering an e-learning system that helps learners solve problems, the system 
first takes use of the user module to interpret the action of the user. Thus, 
the system performs a set of interiors actions that are interrelated to the user 
model, to select the most suitable learning situation for the learner’s request. 
After these interiors actions, the system generates actions in the interface.
According to Koch (2000), there are seven key features of the user model. 
These features are user-centric:
•	
Assist the user during the learning of a specific subject.
•	
Provides information to adjust the user.
•	
Adapt the interface to the user.
•	
Help users to find information.
•	
Give immediate feedback to the user on his level of knowledge.
•	
Support collaborative work.
•	
Assist the user during use of the system.
The User Model in Adaptive Hypermedia 
Educational systems
Before presenting the model users in adaptive educational hypermedia systems, 
we must first graspe the position of adaptation in educational hypermedia 
systems. According to Brusilovsky (2000), the adaptation of hypermedia can 
be applied mainly in the presentation and navigation between hyperspaces.
Figure 3 represents the breakdown of adaptation in several technologies 
used in adaptive hypermedia.
To adapt the presentation of the learning content and navigation with 
the needs of the user, the adaptive system needs a user model that includes 
goals or task, history and preferences to accumulate response to how and 
why adaptation. Other learner models according to Lee (Park & Lee, 2003) 
also include interest and personal traits such as personality factors, cognitive 
factors and learning styles; that contains constant characteristics on the user 
even if his interests changes over time.

THE CARACTERISTIQUES OF A LEARNER MODEL
The Difference Between the Learner 
Profile and the Learner Model
Before defining user model, learner model and learner profile. It is interesting 
first to illustrate the difference between “learner profile” and “learner model.”
The learner profile is a collection of personal information about the learner. 
This information is recorded without any description or interpretation. Learner 
profiles represents the essential information of the learner, such as cognitive 
skills, skills, intentions, learning styles, preferences and interaction of the 
learner with the system. The modeling of this stored information gives us 
the model of the learner.
Figure 4 represents the process of adaptation performed by the learner 
model in an adaptive system. The learner information can be modeled on 
the basis of the content and the amount of information about the user which 
is stored in the user profile that change within time. Thus, the user profile 
is used to retrieve the necessary information to formulate a learner model. 
Koch describes a model of the user that the representation of the beliefs of the 
Figure 3.The level of adaptation in hypermedia technologies

30
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
system on the user. The user of the “real world” is perceived by the system 
through the human-machine interface.
A profile contains personal information without deduction or interpretation. 
Unlike the learner model which is a higher level than the learner profile, 
learner profile is seen as an abstract view of the learner. Moreover, the learner 
model is able to deduct additional information about the learner. The learner 
model is based upon such information and is therefore only a small part of the 
actual learning. Nevertheless, the learner model must represent the necessary 
characteristics of the learner in the context of the education system.
The Components of a Learner Model
The components of a learner model are stored information that can be analyzed 
and grouped according to different levels of information. These components 
are connected to the application of the learner model. There are two types of 
components in the model of the learner:
•	
The performance model stores data sets related to assessments of 
learner skills. (Zhou & Evens, 1999).
•	
The model of learning history follows types of data presented to the 
learner during use of the system, and measures system knowledge level 
Figure 4. Learner’s profile and learner model in adaptation

31
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
based on the history of the interaction with the interface (Jeremić & 
Devedžić, 2004).
According to Zhou, it is necessary to put additional components to provide 
complete information about the learner. Such as: response history and balance 
the sheet of solutions. The learner’s response history is attached to each unit 
of instruction; it stores information about the learning items and the learner 
responses during a learning situation. The number of errors and descriptions 
of these errors during the problem solving process are stored in the solution 
or the balance sheet. (Zhou & Evens, 1999)
According to Castillo et al., (2003) the authors propose that the learner 
model must be divided into several components such as profile, model of 
cognitive overlay and an overlay model.
The Contents of a Learner Model
According to Self, a complete learner model must contain information about 
the domain knowledge of the learner, his preferences, key goals, interests, 
his progress and other information about the learner. All this information is 
essential for the use of the systems (Self, 1994)
Brusilovsky states that learners models can be classified according to 
the nature and form of the information contained in the models. Taking the 
example of a subject area, the information stored in the learner model is 
composed of two areas of information: the specific domain of information 
and independent domain of information. Figure 5 shows the components of 
Figure 5. Learner domaines of informations

32
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
each information domain, the combination of these two areas of information 
provides a complete view of learners for adaptive systems (Brusilovsky, 2000)
Specific Domain of Information
The specific domain of information is a reflection of the level of knowledge 
and skills of a student in a learning situation.
Brusilovsky, names of the specific domain of information to the model 
of a specific area. The knowledge model can be based on the combination 
of two or more initialization method and models such as: scalar model, the 
overlay model, error model, genetic model ... in this chapter, we will not 
argue the initialization methods of the domain model, but we will discuss in 
the following sections some aspect of this methods to explain what we mean 
by the initialization of a learner model (Brusilovsky, 2000)
Furthermore, the specific domain of information stores other additional 
information, which is related to the learner in a specific area, in the learner 
model. Theses information can be stored as follows:
•	
The requirements in the area of learning to the learner.
•	
An archive of information on learning activities.
•	
An archive on the assessments and tests.
Independent Domain of Information
In addition to storing the level of current knowledge of a learner, independent 
domain of information facilitates the process of adaptability. According to 
Han, the independent area information on a learner includes (Han, 2003):
•	
Goals: It is important to know the goals of the learner and to determine 
the learning strategies. The goal can be divided into two different 
types: The first type is the learning goal which is relatively stable for a 
training unit. The second type is the problem-solving goal which can 
shift from one problem to another within the same learning situation.
•	
Cognitive Aptitudes: Cognitive aptitudes are the intellectual capacity 
for different kinds of cognitive performance. Such as, musical ability, 
mathematical ability ...
•	
Motivation States: Measures the learner’s motivational state in training, 
teaching… Motivation is measured using a number of long-term and 

33
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
short-term parameters. These parameters are for example the effort, 
attention, interest, distraction and persistence, etc. These parameters 
are related to other factors such as the level of knowledge, preparation, 
the complexity of the subject and the learning outcomes.
•	
Background and Experience: The background and experience of a 
learner are derived from the model parameters, information about the 
background and experience are used. General information includes 
skills that can influence the achievement of learning. Such information 
displays the occupation, work experience or perspectives of a learner
•	
Preferences: Learners may have different preferences related to aspects 
of the learning environment. These preferences are considered non-
inducible system. Thus, the student must inform the system directly or 
indirectly of his or her preferences
LEARNER MODELLING, TECHNIQUES AND METHODS
A learner model is a combination of all relevant data on the learner in relation 
to a learning environment. There are common types of information among 
learners’ models such as object domain information, goals, motivation, training 
and experience, cognitive skills, preferences and demographic training data.
The contents of a learner model are arranged in multiple components 
depending on the type of information. To put together the necessary 
information, it is necessary to make use of different methods that will be 
presented in this section, and will be investigated to show the impact of 
each one of them on adaptive systems and its field of intervention (Anouar 
Tadlaoui et al., 2016)
Figure 6. Exemple of the overlay model structure

34
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
The Overlay Model
The main idea of overlay model is that the learner model is a domain model 
subset. In other words, the learner overlay model is a shot of the full domain 
model. Figure 6 represents the relationships between the different concepts 
of a domain model.
A domain model consists of a set of knowledge elements representing 
the knowledge of expertise; each element represents a concept, a topic or a 
theme in a major field. Thus, the model structure of the learner “mimics” 
the domain model structure. However, each model element of the learner 
(corresponding to each domain model element) has a specific value measuring 
the knowledge of the user of this element. This value is considered the master 
of the domain element included a certain range. In other words, the domain 
is decomposed into a set of elements and the overlay model (learner model) 
which is a set of the more mastered elements. Suppose that mastery level 
of each element ranges from 0 (not mastered) to 1 (mastered). The expert 
model is the superposition with 1 for each element and the learner model is 
the superposition 1 at most for each item.
The overlay modeling approach was based on the domain models which are 
often constructed as a knowledge network or hierarchical tree of knowledge. 
Experts are the authors with the responsibility to create the domain model. 
Normally, each concept in the domain model is mapped to a learning object. 
Today there is a tendency to build the domain model using ontologies.
Stereotype Method
Generally, stereotypes represent a class or group of learners. There are two 
types of stereotypes: fixed and default.
In fixed stereotypes, the learner is assigned to a predefined stereotype on 
an abstract level. For example: in a data base module, learners are divided 
into four groups corresponding to four levels (novice, beginner, advanced 
and expert).
Figure 7 illustrates that each level is more difficult than the previous level: 
After getting individual information such as: knowledge, experience, skills ... 
the system assigns each student one of four levels, and it will never change 
in this type of stereotype.
In default stereotype, the system is more flexible. Therefore, the learner is 
assigned first to the initial stereotype. This means that the initial stereotype has 

35
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
a value “default”. During the learning process the system will observe their 
learners and collect performance data, their actions, their test results ... Then, 
the system will modify the original stereotype again to a more appropriate 
stereotype, whereby the default stereotype setting is gradually replaced by a 
more accurate stereotype for the learner.
There are three important elements in every stereotype: triggers, inference 
and retraction:
•	
Trigger: Is used to activate a stereotype. In other words, it is a condition 
to assign a stereotype to the learner. For example: if the trigger “I have 
no knowledge of the database” is activated, the stereotype “Database-
novice” will be assigned to the learner.
•	
Inference: Is an engine which is responsible for the deduction of 
information related to the learner. For illustration: if the learner is 
connected to stereotype “Database-expert” the inference engine should 
take both essential information and additional information such as, 
learner knows the design of databases, relational models SQL queries 
and ...
•	
Retraction: Provides the conditions to disable the stereotype of the 
learner. In the case of retraction, the learner is assigned with the 
stereotype “Database-novice” at the auto set of the course; but the 
learner then enriches the knowledge in database after the learning 
process, the fact that will make of the stereotype “Database- novice “an 
unsuitable stereotype. The event “the learner has passed the Database 
test with success” is the condition to retrace its stereotype “Database-
novice” and it will be replaced with the stereotype “Database-Expert”.
Figure 7. Example of the stereotype’s method representation

36
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
Machine Learning
For Webb, machine learning methods are used to model the cognitive processes 
underlying the actions of the learner like modeling differences between the 
learner’s skills and the expert’s skills, modeling behavioral preferences of 
the learner and his characteristics. Yet, it must be noticed that the two first 
objectives of this method are very often addressed, but modeling the behavior 
and characteristics of the leaner is rarely used by specialized scholars. (Webb 
et al., 2001)
Plan Recognition
Plan recognition is a sequence of actions of learners to achieve concrete 
goals. The plan recognition is based on the monitory of the performance of 
the user based on these entries (Kobsa, 1993).
User actions are adapted to a library of all possible plans. The plan most 
similar to the actions of the user actions will be chosen as a model of the 
learner. It is a plan recognition process. In this approach, it is very expensive 
to create a library and requires complex calculation and a large storage. And 
the implementation of this method requires a complex algorithm.
Deferential Model
The overlay model is based on domain knowledge of the expert, but it is 
necessary for the learner / teacher to transit the knowledge to the learner. 
This knowledge is called the expected knowledge. In other words, experts’ 
knowledge is the domain knowledge that learners must master for some time.
Therefore, the differential model is essentially an overlay model on the 
knowledge provided, which in turn, is superimposed on the domain of expert 
knowledge. With the list of the top-down methodology, differential model is 
a variant of the overlay model.
However, the differential model is an instance of the class “default model”, 
because knowledge should be considered as the knowledge that the user does 
not have.

37
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
Perturbation Model
Both overlay model and differential model assume that the learner’s knowledge 
is the subset of the misconceptions of expertise knowledge or lack of knowledge. 
These errors were considered false beliefs.
Figure 8 represents the hierarchy of the perturbation model in which the 
learner’s knowledge is represented as a subset of expert’s knowledge (as an 
overlay model) to add their false knowledge. Thus, the perturbation model is 
also an instance of the “fault pattern” class. This model, therefore, opens a 
new trend of modeling that can be supportive and suitable for adaptive system.
Bayesian Methods
Definition
Knowledge representation and reasoning from these representations has 
created many models. Probabilistic graphical models, specifically Bayesian 
networks initiated by Pearl (Pearl, 1998) in the 1980s, have proved to be 
useful tools for the representation of uncertain knowledge and reasoning 
from incomplete information.

Thus, the graphical part of the Bayesian network indicates the dependency 
(or independence) between variables and provides a visual tool for knowledge 
representation that is easily comprehended by its users. In addition, the use 
of probability allows us to take into account the uncertainty in quantifying 
the dependencies between variables. Both properties have been the reason 
behind the first names of Bayesian networks, “probabilistic expert systems”, 
where the graph is compared to the set of rules of conventional expert system, 
where the conditional probabilities presented as a quantification uncertainty 
about the rules.
Mayo has also shown that Bayesian networks allow representing compactly 
the joint probability distribution over the set of variables (Mayo & Mitrovic, 
2001):

This decomposition of a global function, as a local product terms depending 
only of the node and its parents in the graph, is a fundamental property of 
Bayesian networks. It is the basis of the first work on the development of 
inference algorithms which calculate the probability of any variable of the 
model from the same partial observation of other variables. This has been 
proved NP-complete, but resulted in different algorithms that can be treated 
as information propagation methods in a graph. These methods obviously 
use the concept of conditional probability, i.e. what is the probability of Xi  
knowing that I have observed Xj but also the Bayes theorem that calculates, 
conversely, the probability of Xj knowing Xi  when P Xi

Construction of a Bayesian Network
As we have seen in the definition, the complete specification of a Bayesian 
network requires specifying a share structure (directed acyclic graph that 
underlies) and other parameters (probability tables). To do this, two approaches 

39
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
are possible and can be combined: the collection of expertise and machine 
learning, which is one of the contributions of Bayesian networks.
In the case of collection of expertise, the definition of the network structure 
begins with the identification of possible nodes and the distinction between 
(unobservable) informational variables (inputs) or hypothetical. The existence 
of an arc can be analyzed in terms of influence of one variable on another, 
but its orientation is more difficult. Traditionally, an arc is directed from A to 
B if A is a cause of B, but we will see that this interpretation is not so simple 
as in the case of the learner modeling. The parameters are in turn attached 
in an approximate manner by using frequentists or qualitative information.
Since Bayesian network is a probability distribution, we can use maximum 
likelihood as statistical learning parameters criterion. The result is as a 
Bayesian network whose structure is fixed and E which is a comprehensive 
basis of example, the maximum likelihood is achieved if the parameters of the 
Bayesian network are equal to the frequencies of the same features observed in 
E. statistical learning structure requires for its development test to determine 
whether or not the random variables are conditionally independent.
Using Bayesian Networks for Learner Modeling
In general, Bayesian methods are related to other modeling methods of the 
learner model like the overlay model, methods of stereotypes or the machine 
learning methods. Bayesian methods use probabilistic inference to update and 
improve the belief values of a learner during a learning situation. The main 
objective of Bayesian networks is the probabilistic inference. Bayesian network 
models explicitly the uncertainty between the requirements represented by use 
case and collaboration diagrams elements that’s represents the user actions 
in an adaptive system.
We believe that Bayesian networks will provide a solution that will allow 
us to understand and measure dynamically all the actions of the learner in 
a learning situation. The networks obtained will provide us with a capacity 
to monitor and evaluate the performance of every learner at a real time, the 
learner’s actions, the reason for these choices, and identification of each of 
the paths that will be followed during a learning situation.

LEARNER MODELLING METHODES: 
COMPARATIVE STUDY
Based on the conducted research on modeling the learner model in adaptive 
educational hypermedia, this section will try to present a comparative analysis 
of all the methods of learner modeling and management, and to work out an 
appropriate method that will gives us satisfying results.
Learner Modeling in the Existing AHES
In order to present a comprehensive comparative study on learner modeling 
in adaptive educational systems. It seems necessary compare the modeling of 
the learner model in ten different adaptive educational hypermedia systems.
Table 1 represents 10 different adaptive educational hypermedia systems. 
Reflecting for each AHES the methods or approaches used to model the 
learner model.
AVANTI is a system designed for a range of users with different needs. 
This system combines in the stages of data collection and initialization of 
the learner model stereotypes and superposition method to create initial 
assumptions, and to maintain the knowledge of the user.
The AHM system, in which the adaptation depends on the level of 
expertise on the concepts of the field know the system is a subset of all the 
user’s domain concepts.
The ELM-ART system is an Adaptive distance Tutor system, which 
support learning Lisp programming language. It uses different techniques 
for initializing and updating its learning model: overlay model, the complex 
machine learning methods and Bayesian networks to represent episodic 
learning model.
The Modeling Methods’ Area of Intervention
Table 2 represents a comparison between the different methods of learner 
modeling in adaptive system from previous research like Castillo et al., (2003), 
to Brusilovsky, (2000), and Zhou and Evens, (1999).
The machine learning method operates in the initialization and the update 
steps of the learner model, which enables the ability to manage accurately 
and dynamically the cotenants of a specific area of the information from a 
learner model. By using this method, we can represent the learner’s knowledge 

41
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
and skills and trace its evolution in a learning situation. However, there is a 
representation deficiency of independent information in the field of information 
in the learner model and in the data collection phase of a learner model.
The overlay model, the differential model and perturbation model are 
concerned with the representation of the specific domain of information of the 
knowledge domain as it is emphasized in previous sections. The representation 
of other aspects of the learner such as preferences, history, and learning

styles ... requires a combination of these methods with other methods that 
are concerned to manage the actions and preferences of the learner.
The method of stereotypes is the most useful method used during the stages 
of data collection and initialization of the learner in adaptive systems. But 
the update of the learner model requires the combination of this method with 
other more flexible methods such as machine learning or Bayesian networks. 
The stereotypes method does not give the system the ability to track and adapt 
dynamically to each share of the learner, it is limited to affect the learner to 
a well-defined stereotype after termination of the situation of learning.
Bayesian networks appear to be formalism that enables us to ensure the 
inclusion of uncertainty in modeling the learner, such as implementations of 
different systems have shown. However the level of learner expertise should 
not be translated only by changes of probability but also by structural changes.
Learner Model Development
Despite these various attempts to model the learning that is characterized 
by a dynamic aspect, we always find it difficult to achieve this goal. The 
proposed approaches give us just a static view of the learner model, but in 
practice this model is in full development (the learner knowledge is evolving 
in the same module) to a dynamic view. In order to monitor the behavior of 
the learner in real time during training, we must adopt a model for dynamic 
management of the learning model.
All actions of the learner in a learning situation are not limited to valid or 
invalid actions (true and false), but these actions are characterized according 
to the learner learning path during his training. From this observation, we 
Figure 9. Learner model’s construction methods

43
Modeling Techniques and Models in Adaptive Hypermedia Education Systems
cannot represent the information from the system of each learner as a relative 
data. This demands putting our work in a probabilistic context due to the 
changes in the learner model during training.
Figure 9 represents the stages of development of a model of the learner, 
and the intervention of each management method learner model. In the data 
collection phase, we find the method of stereotypes and Bayesian networks 
are the most used. The first method focuses on the learner’s responses to the 
personal information stored for the formulation of the learner profile, where 
as for the Bayesian networks method represent the learner’s information as 
a direct acyclic graph and constructs one or more network that contain this 
information.
In the initialization stage of a learner model, the collected data undertakes 
a transformation process towards the model of the learner. This initialization 
process is realized through the implementation of several methods. The 
overlay model is the most useful method that initializes then information of 
the domain of this model, but it neglects independent domain information. 
The same remark can be made about the perturbation and differential method. 
On the other hand, the plan recognition method sets up independent domain 
of information based on monitoring the performance of the user in adaptive 
systems. Yet, this method can be defined as a constant or a static method, since 
it is based on a predefined plan that the learner follows; a plan that is stored 
in the library of actions, and that generates initialization of the independent 
domain of information’s problems.
The information that is used to update the learner model can be retrieved, 
implicitly or explicitly from various sources of information. Among the 
sources of information, we find the information currently stored in the learner 
model. This information can be used as a source for which we derive new 
information or make changes to the alleged information. Furthermore, the 
information currently stored in the other system components may be useful.
CONCLUSION
As a conclusion, it is safe to say that the learner model plays an important role 
in most hypermedia system and adaptive educational hypermedia systems in 
particular. However, it seems difficult to classify the models and choose the 
appropriate and relevant modeling methods. Each of these methods can be 
considered as a relative method since it emphasizes on one information side 
of the learner’s model and ignore other sides of information in educational

hypermedia. Even if a method is applied in two types of domains information, 
it cannot be applicable in the three stages of construction of the learner model.
Based on our previous works (Anouar Tadlaoui et al. 2015;Anouar 
Tadlaoui et al. 2017, 2018), the use of Bayesian networks for initialization 
and updating the learner model seems to be more satisfying method at the 
level of tracking and evaluating the learner’s performances during a learning 
situation. The contention of our work is to articulate a new approach that will 
help us in managing and modeling the learner model through an integration/ 
combination of several modeling methods mentioned in this work. Moreover, 
our work shivers to introduce an approach that can manage two types of 
independent and specific information of the domain of the learner, and that 
can be relevant to the three stages of the construction of the learner model.

ABSTRACT
First of all, and to clarify the purpose, it seems important to say that the work 
presented in this chapter lies within the framework of learner modeling in 
an adaptive system understood as computational modeling of the learner. 
One must also state that Bayesian networks are effective tools for learner 
modeling under uncertainty. They have been successfully used in many 
systems, with different objectives, from the assessment of knowledge of the 
learner to the recognition of the plan followed in problem solving. The main 
objective of this chapter is to develop a Bayesian networks for modeling the 
learner from the use case diagram of the unified modeling language. The 
prototypes and diagrams presented in this chapter are arguments in favor of 
the objective. The network obtained also promotes reusing learner modeling 
through similar systems.

INTRODUCTION
The problem of this chapter can be summarized as follows: Why and how can 
we represent a Learner model using Bayesian networks? How can we go from 
a dynamic representation of the Unified modeling language (UML) model to 
a probabilistic representation with Bayesian networks? Is this consideration 
experimentally justified?
The learner model is a data structure that represents the state of knowledge 
of a learner in a given field. This model identifies the learner’s current level 
of understanding of the domain knowledge. It includes data on individual 
variables of a learner that allow updating of the learner profiles from 
information obtained during the interactions.
All existing approaches to model the learner are based generally on using the 
Unified Modeling Language, that quickly became a standard for the analysis 
and design in software development. Since it provides a schematic approach 
to describing the needs of the user, which begins with the use cases diagrams, 
and leads to a more formal specification, using stereotyped classes in the 
analysis model. The components of this modeling language form the basis 
of an architectural view in the system while providing the foundation for the 
design, implementation and validation and verification (Booch et al., 1999)
We have attempted in previous works, to model the learner using Bayesian 
networks and multi networks as a formalism to manage uncertainty in the 
management of learner model. In this chapter, we will try to offer a combination 
of these two approaches, starting with specifying the transformation rules on 
which we have based our work. We will then demonstrate how to transform 
the use case diagrams into a Bayesian network based on these rules. Finally 
we will present the formal structure for this consideration. (Anouar Tadlaoui 
et al., 2014; Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2015)
USE CASE DIAGRAM: UML POINT OF VIEW
Concept and Definition
Use cases describe the form of actions, reactions and the behavior of a system 
from a user perspective. They allow defining the limits of the system and the 
relationship between the system and the environment.

50
Development of Bayesian Networks From Use Case Diagrams
Use cases are filling a lack of raw object methods, such as Rumbaugh 
(Rumbaugh et al., 1991) and Jacobson (Booch et al., 1999), which did not 
offer techniques, for the identification of needs. In this sense, the use cases 
associated with technical objects allow a comprehensive approach to the 
entire life cycle, from the specification to implementation.
A use case is a specific way of using a system. It is the image of system 
functionality, triggered in response to the stimulation of an external actor.
Use Case Diagram’s Relationships
Use case diagrams represent actors and relationships between actions and 
actors. We will define in this section the main relationships in the use case 
diagram that we will use in our work, they are three types of relationships 
between actors and use cases:
Generalization Relationship
A case A is a generalization of a case B if B is a particular case of A. For 
example, the consultation of an account via the Internet is a particular case of 
the consultation. This relationship of generalization / specialization is present 
in most of the UML diagrams and results in the concept of inheritance in 
object-oriented languages.
In Figure 1, we observe that use case A initiates a use case B; this action is 
represented by an arrow from the initiator of the action to the triggered action.
Inclusion Relationship
A case A includes a case B if the behavior described by the case A includes 
the conduct of the case B: Where A depends on B. When A is applied, B 
also must be applied as a part of A.
Figure 1. Generalization relationship in use case diagram

51
Development of Bayesian Networks From Use Case Diagrams
This dependence is symbolized by the “include” stereotype. For 
example, accessing information from a bank account necessarily includes 
an authentication phase with a username and password.
The inclusions essentially allow factorizing a part of the description of a 
use case that would be common to other use cases like Figure.2 shows. The 
inclusions are also used to decompose a complex case into simpler sub-cases.
Extension Relationship
It is said that use case A extends a use case B when the use case A can be 
called during the execution of the use case B. Running B may possibly lead 
to the execution of A: unlike the inclusion, the extension is optional. This 
dependence is symbolized by the stereotype “extend”

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS
Concepts and Definition
A learner model allows keeping the learner information, for example his 
level of knowledge on a given topic (performance), his frequent mistakes/
misunderstandings, psychological characteristics, etc.

52
Development of Bayesian Networks From Use Case Diagrams
A learner model can be defined as a set of structured information about 
the learning process, and this structure contains values on the characteristics 
of the learner (Zaitseva et Boule, 2005) It provides the necessary data to the 
other modules to achieve the adaptation of teaching to the learner (Beck et 
al., 1996)
Many studies emphasize the uncertainty of the information contained in 
the student model and the importance of the intention behind the creation of 
this model. Thus, a student model represents the belief system about learners’ 
beliefs (the system’s beliefs about the learner’s beliefs) accumulated during 
the diagnostic process.
Typologies of Learner Model
The learner model is a data structure in the computer sense that characterizes 
for the learning environment, the state of a subset of the learner’s knowledge 
from the system point of view.
It will be defined by the difference between the learner knowledge and 
target knowledge, issue of learning, as represented in the system. The approach 
to represent this difference leads to distinguish two major classes of models:
•	
The models of partial or overlay expertise, in which the knowledge of 
the learner is only a subset of the target knowledge. The idea behind 
this type of model is that the learner present deficiencies or the poorly 
insured knowledge, or somehow weaknesses, it is identified to allow 
it to grow. The aim of the learning system is then to complete the 
knowledge of the learner in order to acquire all the knowledge outlined 
in the model (Carr & Goldstein, 1977)
•	
Differential 
models, 
which 
incorporate 
“false 
knowledge”, 
corresponding to perturbations of the expert knowledge or erroneous 
preconceptions. In fact, studies show that many errors are not due 
to erratic behavior of learners, but the correct application of false 
procedures. To develop a model of learners’ knowledge, one must take 
into account these types of systematic errors, that researchers will be 
designated by the term “bug” (bug). (Wenger, 1987)
While a partial model invites expertise in teaching strategies centered on 
the fact to fill the gaps of the learner, the incremental models will lead to 
strategies based on remediation.

BAYESIAN NETWORKS
Concept and Definition
Knowledge representation and reasoning from these representations has 
created many models. Probabilistic graphical models, specifically Bayesian 
networks initiated by Pearl in the 1980s, have proven to be useful tools for 
representing uncertain knowledge and reasoning from incomplete information 
(Pearl, 1988)

Thus, the graphical part of the Bayesian network indicates the dependencies 
(or independence) between variables and provides a visual tool for knowledge 
representation, more easily comprehensible by its users. In addition, the 
use of probability allows taking into account uncertainty in quantifying the 
dependencies between variables. Both properties have been the cause of the 
first names of Bayesian networks, “probabilistic expert systems”, where the 
graph was compared to the set of rules of conventional expert system, and 
the conditional probabilities presented as a quantification uncertainty about 
the rules.
Heckerman Also have shown that Bayesian networks allow representing 
compactly the joint probability distribution over the set of variables (Geiger 
& Heckerman, 1996):

This decomposition of a global function as a local product terms depending 
only of the node and its parents in the graph, is a fundamental property of 
Bayesian networks. It is the basis of the first work on the development of 
inference algorithms which calculate the probability of any variable of the 
model from the same partial observation of other variables. This has been 

54
Development of Bayesian Networks From Use Case Diagrams
proven NP-complete, but resulted in different algorithms that can be treated 
as information propagation methods in a graph. These methods obviously 
use the concept of conditional probability, i.e. what is the probability of Xi  
knowing that I have observed Xj  but also the Bayes theorem, that calculates, 
conversely, the probability of Xj  knowing Xi  when P Xi

Construction of a Bayesian Network
As we have seen in the definition, the complete specification of a Bayesian 
network requires specifying a share structure (directed acyclic graph that 
underlies) and other parameters (probability tables). To do this, two approaches 
are possible and can be combined: the collection of expertise and machine 
learning, which is one of the attractions of Bayesian networks.
In the case of collection of expertise, the definition of the network structure 
begins with the identification of possible nodes and the distinction between 
(unobservable) informational variables (inputs) or hypothetical. The existence 
of an arc can be analyzed in terms of influence of one variable on another, 
but its orientation is more difficult. Traditionally, an arc is directed from A to 
B if A is a cause of B, but we will see that this interpretation is not as simple 
in the case of the learner modeling. The parameters are in turn attached in an 
approximate manner by using frequentists or qualitative information.
Since Bayesian network is a probability distribution, we can use maximum 
likelihood as statistical learning parameters criterion. The result is as a 
Bayesian network whose structure is fixed and E which is a comprehensive 
basis of example, the maximum likelihood is achieved if the parameters of the 
Bayesian network are equal to the frequencies of the same features observed in 
E. statistical learning structure requires for its development test to determine 
whether or not the random variables are conditionally independent. (Becker 
& Naïm, 1999)
DEVELOPMENT OF BAYESIAN NETWORK 
FROM A USE CASE DIAGRAMME
The Choice of Bayesian Networks
As we previously presented, the diagrams of use cases is a top view of system 
features, it allows us to present all user actions (learner in our case). These 

55

actions may require elements of uncertainty, this uncertainty will clearly 
present when poised to collaboration diagrams. Representing this uncertainty 
becomes very important when there are a large number of interdependent 
and potentially conflicting requirements that overwhelm the capacity of 
spontaneous human spirit.
Bayesian network models explicitly the uncertainty between the 
requirements represented by use case and collaboration diagrams elements. 
During the presentation of the functional evidence such as the importance of 
a particular learner, a quantitative assessment can be performed to the way 
we strongly believe the requirement is indicated. We therefore see the ability 
to transform the use case diagrams of Bayesian networks as a significant 
potential lead in the modeling of the learner.
We believe that Bayesian networks will provide a solution that will allow 
us to understand and measure a dynamic way all the actions of the learner in 
a learning situation. Networks obtained, we will give a capacity to monitor 
and represent at real time, all the actions of the learner, the rationale for these 
choices, and identification of each of the paths that will be followed during 
a learning situation.
Bayesian Network Development’s Rules
Generalization Relationship
A generalized use case diagram contains a common functionality that 
is available for all the specialized use cases. The transformation of the 
generalization relationship to nodes of a Bayesian network is simple:
Consider Figure 4 in the use case A is a generalization of the use case 
A1 and the use case A2, we represent the functional requirement A1 and A2 
being a descendant of the functional requirement of A.
This results in a Bayesian network with a similar structure. The direction 
of the arc flow from A to A1 and A2 reflecting a top-down decomposition. 
The information represented in the arrows of the use case will be included in 
the functional requirements. This indicates that it is more likely to encounter 
the general case of the specific functional requirement. Thus:
P A

Inclusion Relationship
The inclusion relation in a use case diagram models the situation in which a 
use case is composed of a desired number of use cases. For inclusion, the high 
level of use cases cannot run without the implementation of sub use cases.
To see how this can be translated to fragments of the Bayesian network, 
consider Figure 5 use case A is linked to use cases A1 and A2 by an inclusion 
relation:
This results in a Bayesian network with a similar structure as the 
generalization relationship. The direction of the arc flow from A to A1 and 
A2 reflecting a composition from bottom to top in the information represented 
in the arrows of the use case will be included in the functional requirements. 
This indicates that it is more likely to encounter the general case of the specific 
functional requirement. Thus:
P A

Extension Relationship
The extension relationship in a use case diagram represents a particular use 
case branched additional behavior given the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
In case of extension, the first use case does not need any more use case to run. 
The second use case is an exceptional behavior if the conditions are fulfilled.
Consider the general case schematized on Figure 6. A use case is extended 
by the case of A1 use. This models the situation in which an additional 
criterion triggers the case of using A1 after executing use case A.
The additional criterion is described in the flow of events from textual 
description. This situation is modeled as functional requirement A1 implied 
by the functional requirement A. The additional criterion is modeled as 
another functional requirement node. The direction of the implication is the 
additional criterion (AC) to the functional requirement A1. Thus:

Learner Modelling Using Bayesian Networks
Our work lies in the framework of learner modeling in an adaptive educational 
system, to illustrate the ideas discussed in the previous sections; we will take 
an example of the actions of a learner in an adaptive system. We defined the 
Table 1 several actions of a learner in a learning situation.
Learner Use Case Diagram
Considering Figure 7 a main actor is identified, named the learner. The figure 
shows the generalization relationships between use cases and the learner, 
and generalization relationships, inclusion and extension between use cases.
In particular, the functional requirement “follow courses” is represented 
with a generalization relationship between the functional requirements 
“learning activity” and “evaluation”. The functional requirements “post 
in the forum issues” and “pretest” are represented with a generalization 
relationship with actor “Learner”. There are also extensions relationships 
in the functional requirement “module” and its relationship to functional

requirements “remediation” and “call tutor.” Inclusion relations are presented 
in the representation of the relationships between functional requirements 
“call tutor”, “reading the history of the learner” and “system awareness.”
Bayesian Network Obtained
Once the use case diagrams have been created, it is easy to create the structure 
of the Bayesian network using the rules described in the previous sections. 
Figure 8 represents the Bayesian network representation of the main actions 
of the learner in a Learning situation, constructed from the use case diagram 
shown in Figure 7. Note how the conditional independence was directly 
modeled by applying the rules as shown.

CONCLUSION
We have shown in this work, how we can develop with well defined rules; 
Bayesian networks from use case diagrams of Unified Modeling Language
This work is a major step in our research in modeling the learner in an 
adaptive educational system, the transition from the use case diagrams 
towards Bayesian networks; give us the opportunity to reach our goal to use 
the Bayesian networks as a formalism to manage uncertainty in the modeling 
of the learner.
We see two main directions in which we can continue this work. On the 
one hand by applying our ideas to more advanced conceptual models as 
used so far. And on the other hand is transforming the Bayesian networks 
obtained a machine readable language, or one using probabilistic ontology 
as we proposed in previous work (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2016), or perform 
a combination of Bayesian networks with ontologies. (Anouar Tadlaoui et 
al., 2017 ; Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2018)

ABSTRACT
The work presented in this chapter lies within learner modeling in an adaptive 
educational system construed as a computational modeling of the learner. 
All actions of the learner in a learning situation on an adaptive hypermedia 
system are not limited to valid or invalid actions (true and false), but they 
are a set of actions that characterize the learning path of formation. Thus, 
one cannot represent the information from the system of each learner using 
relative data. It requires putting the work in a probabilistic context due to the 
changes in the learner model information during formation. In this chapter, 
the authors propose to use Bayesian networks as a probabilistic framework 
to resolve the issue of dynamic management and update of the learner model. 
The experiments and results presented in this work are arguments in favor of 
the hypothesis and can also promote reusing the modeling obtained through 
different systems and similar modeling situations.

A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
INTRODUCTION
First of all, to clarify our purpose it seems important to note that the work 
presented in this chapter lies within Learner modeling in an adaptive educational 
system construed as a computational modeling of the learner. That is to say, 
the representation and specification of knowledge (broadly defined) on the 
learner. Different approaches were made to manage the model of the learner 
with multiple objectives, from the learner’s knowledge evaluation, to the 
recognition of the plan followed in problem solving.
Despite these various attempts for modeling the learner which is 
characterized by a dynamic aspect, we always find difficulties in achieving 
this goal. The proposed approaches give us just a static view of the learner 
model, but this model is always in development (the learner knowledge is 
evolving in the same module), that is why a dynamic view is essential. In 
order to monitor the behavior of the learner in real time during formation, we 
must adopt a dynamic modeling approach to the learning model management.
All actions of the learner in a learning situation is not limited to valid 
or invalid actions (true and false), but it is the actions that characterize his 
learning path of his formation. From this observation, we cannot represent 
the information from the system of each learner using relative data. It requires 
locating our work in a probabilistic context due to changes in the learner 
model during formation.
The problem of this chapter can be summarized as follows: how to represent 
the different functions of a model of the learner? What approaches can be used 
to perform the update of the different characteristics of the learner model?
We propose in this work to use Bayesian networks as a probabilistic 
formalism to resolve the issue of management and dynamic update of the 
learner model. To resolve this issue, we must first ask: Why and how we can 
represent a learning model with Bayesian networks? How can we go from a 
dynamic representation of the UML model to a probabilistic representation 
with Bayesian networks? Is this consideration experimentally justified?

THE LEARNER MODE IN ADAPTIVE 
HYPERMEDIA EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS
The purpose of this section is to bring to the readers the knowledge required 
in the fields of Learner modeling. We will come back to in this section on 
definitions and terminology of each of the main key words in our chapter.
Concepts and Definition
The learner modeling is the modeling of all the important features that affect 
the learner (knowledge, preferences, goals, etc.). It comes to identify relevant 
information, to structure, to initialize them, update them and exploit them. 
By replacing the word “learning” with the term “user” this definition is also 
applicable to the model of the user. In the case of an application other than 
the learner’s educational model is called the user model.
A learner model allows keeping the learner information, for example his 
level of knowledge on a given topic (performance), his frequent mistakes/
misunderstandings, psychological characteristics, etc.
A learner model can be defined as a set of structured information about 
the learning process, and this structure contains values on the characteristics 
of the learner. It provides the necessary data to the other modules to achieve 
the adaptation of teaching to the learner (Zaitseva et al., 2005)
Many studies emphasize the uncertainty of the information contained in 
the student model and the importance of the intention behind the creation of 
this model. Thus, a student model represents the belief system about learners’ 
beliefs (the system’s beliefs about the learner’s beliefs) accumulated during 
the diagnostic process (Beck et al., 1996)
The learner model can be an integral part of Hypermedia Systems 
Aadaptatif as it can be shared with multiple systems. In this last case we talk 
about user modeling servers. This type of server is used in environments or 
more distributed adaptive systems access this server to query or update user 
information. Cumulate is one of the most known and used systems for user 
modeling servers (Brusilovsky et al., 2007)

The Foundations of the Learner Model
Self (Self, 1991) defined a formalization of the learner model that is based 
on the beliefs and knowledge of the system and the learner. Beliefs are 
represented by formulas in the propositional calculus. The objects of belief 
are called propositions. Beliefs are related to the behavior of an agent (A), 
a user (U) or system (S). BA = {p/BAP} is the set of beliefs of the agent A. 
BAP are the proposals themselves.
BSU = {p / BSBUp} is the set of proposals that the S system believes 
they are believed by a user U as shown in Figure 1.
The learner model can be defined by a set of proposals that the system S 
thinks about U learner: UM = BS (U) = {p / BSp (U)}
Belief can be replaced by knowledge, therefore KAP = BAp.
To distinguish between the different aspects of the learner model, Self 
distinguishes the following proposals:
•	
Dependent proposals to a field that a learner acquires in a system;
•	
Independent clauses of the system domain. They are also called the 
background;
The proposals that describe the cognitive and personal characteristics of 
the learner, also known as behavioral skills such as preferences, tasks, goals 
and experience.
The Representation of the Learner Model
The learner model is used primarily to provide a structure for the representation 
of domain knowledge of the learner. According to Koch (2002), the data 
concerning the learner can be represented in different ways.
Figure 1. The representation of the system and users beliefs

69
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
Overlay Models
In the recovery model the knowledge of the learner is represented as a 
subset of the knowledge of the system. The latest is created from the expert’s 
knowledge, the domain knowledge or knowledge expected of the learner. It 
is represented as a hierarchical or semantic network. A Boolean or discrete 
value is used to estimate the knowledge of the learner.
User Profiles
They are used to represent the cognitive skills, intellectual abilities, intentions, 
learning or preferences of a user styles. Each ability is associated with a value, 
that value belongs to a range of values.
Stereotyped Models
In this type; the model knowledge of the learner and the properties are also 
represented with a pair of values. The stereotypical model is different from 
the other models in that it models different pairs of values that are assigned 
to a user category (Stereotype) as novice, intermediate or expert. So a user 
inherits from each property to its stereotype. Stereotyped models can be 
combined with the recovery models when a stereotype is assigned to a user 
model for initialization. Stereotyped models are useful for modeling the 
learner but not enough when the individual adaptation requires a more precise 
description of the learner.
BAYESIAN NETWORKS
Before describing our interrogations about the use of Bayesian networks in 
Learner modeling, we return quickly on their definition and the meaning of 
inference in this context.
In the rest of this section, we take a typology of nodes inspired from, 
which is found in different terms in the literature. The field layer is the set 
of nodes modeling epistemic knowledge of the learner, and the task layer 
nodes modeling the actions of the learner (Conati et al., 2002)

A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
Definition
Knowledge representation and reasoning from these representations has 
created many models. Probabilistic graphical models, specifically Bayesian 
networks initiated by Pearl (Pearl, 1988) in the 1980s, have proven to be useful 
tools for representing uncertain knowledge and reasoning from incomplete 
information.

Thus, the graphical part of the Bayesian network indicates the dependencies 
(or independence) between variables and provides a visual tool for knowledge 
representation, more easily comprehensible by its users. In addition, the 
use of probability allows taking into account uncertainty in quantifying the 
dependencies between variables. Both properties have been the cause of the 
first names of Bayesian networks, “probabilistic expert systems”, where the 
graph was compared to the set of rules of conventional expert system, and 
the conditional probabilities presented as a quantification uncertainty about 
the rules.
Mayo (Mayo & Mitrovic, 2001) also has shown that Bayesian networks 
allow representing compactly the joint probability distribution over the set 
of variables:

This decomposition of a global function as a local product terms depending 
only of the node and its parents in the graph, is a fundamental property of 
Bayesian networks. It is the basis of the first work on the development of 
inference algorithms which calculate the probability of any variable of the 

71
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
model from the same partial observation of other variables. This has been 
proven NP-complete, but resulted in different algorithms that can be treated 
as information propagation methods in a graph. These methods obviously 
use the concept of conditional probability, i.e. what is the probability of Xi  
knowing that I have observed Xj  but also the Bayes theorem, that calculates, 
conversely, the probability of Xj  knowing Xi  when P Xi
Xj
(

)  is known.
Construction of a Bayesian Network
As we have seen in the definition, the complete specification of a Bayesian 
network requires specifying a share structure (directed acyclic graph that 
underlies) and other parameters (probability tables). To do this, two approaches 
are possible and can be combined: the collection of expertise and machine 
learning, which is one of the attractions of Bayesian networks.
In the case of collection of expertise, the definition of the network structure 
begins with the identification of possible nodes and the distinction between 
(unobservable) informational variables (inputs) or hypothetical. The existence 
of an arc can be analyzed in terms of influence of one variable on another, 
but its orientation is more difficult. Traditionally, an arc is directed from A to 
B if A is a cause of B, but we will see that this interpretation is not as simple 
in the case of the learner modeling. The parameters are in turn attached in an 
approximate manner by using frequentists or qualitative information.
Since Bayesian network is a probability distribution, we can use maximum 
likelihood as statistical learning parameters criterion. The result is as a 
Bayesian network whose structure is fixed and E which is a comprehensive 
basis of example, the maximum likelihood is achieved if the parameters of the 
Bayesian network are equal to the frequencies of the same features observed in 
E. statistical learning structure requires for its development test to determine 
whether or not the random variables are conditionally independent.
Arcs Orientation
The definition of the structure of a student model based on Bayesian network 
from expert knowledge (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2016), is often done from 
a representation of domain knowledge, we do not discuss here the validity 
of the skeleton (graph undirected) resulting in the type of links that are 
taken into account (mainly partitive or generic). Therefore, obtaining the 
model structure from the skeleton of the orientation requires arcs. These 

72
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
guidelines determine the diagnosis obtained, since as they play a key role in 
the relationship dependency between variables.
The Influence of the Orientation of the Arcs on the Diagnosis
We point out an example of the influence on the arcs orientation of the 
diagnosis obtained. Figure 2 shows a simplified version of the model Hydrive, 
where the performances of the electronics learner can be observed. The set 
of variables representing the different skills of the learner is affected by this 
observation. Thus, if the student is found to be competent in electronics, for 
example because of their initial training, the diagnostic model is the same 
in all other disciplines.
Consider Figure 3, A graph having the same skeleton but with other 
orientations of the arcs. The spread of the information here is much more 
limited.
The diagnosis we got depends not only on arcs orientation’s choices, but 
also it seems that the orientation depends on the expertise level of the learner. 
Indeed, it seems reasonable to consider the network of Figure 2 for a subject 
having followed all the training (for which we can assume a homogeneity 
especially in some skill levels), the network 3 seems more appropriate for a 
about the beginning of training, which can be very proficient in a particular 
area because of its course without the need to master all the skills.
Which Choice for the Orientation of Arcs?
In literature, the choice is massively in favor of a focus node of the domain 
layer to those of the task layer.
Figure 2. The flow of information in the learner model of Hydrive

73
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
The question remains open regarding the arcs linking the nodes in the 
domain layer. It is common to present this choice as an alternative choice 
between a general orientation to the individual or it opposite. We find in 
literature examples of these two choices (Dimitrova et al., 1999; Mislevy et 
al., 1996), even if the justification given for this choice is not always totally 
convincing, even if sometimes it doesn’t exist. This dichotomy itself is to 
our knowledge never has been partly explained the concept of equivalent 
Bayesian networks under Markov. (Zapata-Rivera et al., 2000)
The orientation of the arcs from the general to the particular is suitable when 
the skills of the learner have certain homogeneity because of dependencies 
of this orientation. The orientation on the other side is most appropriate 
for learners with diverse skills. Moreover, if we take the findings on the 
relationship between network structure and level of expertise of the learner, 
we conclude that the model must allow this structural change.
LEARNER MODELING IN ADAPTIVE 
HYPERMEDIA EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS
In this section we will present the steps to follow when modeling the learner 
in an adaptive educational system using UML, beginning from the user meta 
model and into the use case diagram regrouping all the actions of the learner 
in adaptive system

The Learner’s Meta-Model
We will present in this section a specific user meta-model for e-learning 
presented by Aammou (2013). This model features a combination of models 
for e-learning and adaptive hypermedia. It takes into account elements such as 
the history of actions, which are rarely taken into account in formal models. 
The construction of this model allowed us to understand the user’s creative 
process model for adaptive hypermedia, helping us to build our hypernym 
model. (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2015)
In our user model for e-learning, we want to be able to:
•	
Define the characteristics attributes, essential and common to all users: 
name, username, password and age;
•	
Define attribute categories to separate the user’s preferences, their 
school / career and other attributes. This distinction will facilitate 
importing data, system maintenance, as well as communication with 
external systems; the attributes are differentiated according to their 
nature.
•	
Retain the documents covered by the user in two ways: first, by 
involving them in a whole course on the other hand, specifically related 
to the concept that they have investigated. The aim of this historical 
duplicate is to present the same documents to the user, when he wishes 
to come back on a concept already brought to its attention, that during 
his first learning this concept.
The UML class diagram representation of our user model is given in 
Figure 4.
•	
The User Manager: Class is responsible for interfacing with the other 
components of adaptive hypermedia system. For this purpose, it is 
provided of the Ask and Tell methods to ask questions and provide 
answers to the external components (domain model, adaptation model). 
It is connected to all the users; it is responsible for managing, by an 
aggregation relationship.
•	
The User: Class is responsible for representing information about a 
particular user. It is composed of predefined attributes: name, username, 
password and age.

75
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
•	
Attribute Preference: Class is responsible for representing the 
preferences of the user. These are view preferences: font size, color 
problems, contrast, etc., and his presentation preferences. He may 
prefer textual or graphic elements. He may not want audio element, for 
example.
•	
The Attribute Background: Class is responsible for representing the 
user attributes related to their academic / professional background.
•	
The Stereotype: Class is responsible for representing the various 
categories of stereotypes to which the user belongs. By definition, a 
stereotype is an image or a fixed design and schematic of an aspect 
of reality. In our model, a stereotype consists of a name and a value. 
The name sets the stereotype (eg “learning rate”) and the value used 
to characterize the user (eg quick for the stereotype “learning rate”). 
The number of possible values is often reduced to a given stereotype. 
Values are often based on other attributes. Stereotypes are different 
from other attributes by their schematic characterization of the user, 
where they can represent much more granularity elements.
•	
Other attribute: Class is responsible for representing the user attributes 
which are not related to his career and which are not preferences, for 
example, a data encryption key. The existence of this class is to ensure 
compatibility of the model with standard models like IMS or PAPI 
Figure 4. UML class diagram representing the user’s meta-model

76

Learner. Because some attributes do not fit into other categories of 
attributes defined above.
•	
Degree: Is an association class which is responsible for giving a value 
to the knowledge of a concept by a user. The possible values are: very 
low, low, average, good, excellent. This scale is a range of values, it 
allows to have a good precision with respect to a binary classification, 
and avoids a too high degree of accuracy and therefore very useful for 
adaptation.
•	
Historical: Class is in charge of representing a historical document 
covered in the learner path, allowing to give the date of the course of 
a document, browsing history in order in a historical path (it contain 
two methods NextDocument() and PreviousDocument()). The historic 
class can be used to represent all the documents covered by a user’s 
history, or to represent the historical documents covered to reach a 
certain degree of knowledge for a given concept.
Both class Document and class Concept are detailed in the model domain.
The Learner Model Use Case Diagram
Based on the meta-model, we were able to map out the functionality of the 
learner using the use case diagram Figure 5 to reflect a part of the student’s 
actions in an adaptive system. We will explain in this part each of these actions 
beholding the relationships of these actions with each other and within the 
system operation process.
Based upon the meta-model presented in the previous section, we have 
illustrated in the following table “Table 1” learner’s actions in a learning 
situation in an adaptive educational system:
Table 1. Learner’s main actions in a Hypermedia system 
Learner’s actions
     • Follow courses 
     • Take pretest 
     • Take evaluation

77
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
In Figure 5 a main actor is identified, named the learner. The figure 
shows the generalization relationships between use cases and the learner, 
and generalization relationships, inclusion and extension between use cases.
In particular, the functional requirement “learner” represents all information 
about the learner in the hypermedia system (his knowledge, his skills, personal 
information ...), this functional requirement is shown with a generalization 
relationship with three functional requirements:
•	
“Pretest” Which represents the information about the pretest that the 
learner has to take before entering the learning situation, the pretest is 
composed of two types of evaluation components: tests of knowledge 
depicted with the functional requirement “knowledge” and a functional 
requirement “skills”, which represents the test through which we will 
evaluate the learner’s skills.
•	
“Learning Activity”, This functional requirement represents the 
information about the learning activities, each learning activity in 
adaptive educational hypermedia system is of two types, static activities 
represented by the functional requirement “Static” and interactive 
activities represented by the functional requirement “Interactive”
•	
“Evaluation”, Which represents the information on the evaluation that 
the learner is to take lead after the completion of each learning activity. 
In case of failure of the learner in the evaluation. The learner must pass 
to a remediation; the remediation is represented through a functional 
requirement “remediation” which is connected with the functional 
requirement “evaluation” through an extension of relationship.
Figure 5. Use case diagram UML representing the learner actions

78
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
In case of remediation, the functional requirement “remediation” involves 
the activation of the functional requirement “call tutor” through inclusion 
relation. This requirement represents the activation of the tutor to help the 
student to return to its shortcomings in the learning activity.
Another inclusion relation is represented in our figure which represents 
the actions of the learner in an adaptive system, appearing in the relationship 
between the functional requirement “call tutor” and requirements “reading the 
history of the learner” that activates the return of the system to the profile an 
the course information of the learner. And a requirement “system awareness”, 
that enables the system to follow the course of the learner after remediation.
THE BAYESIAN NETWORK OF A LEARNER MODEL
In this section we will present the transformation formation of our use case 
diagram representing the learner model into a Bayesian network.
The Model Structure
The development of Bayesian network based on the use case diagram for 
modeling the learner in an adaptive educational system passes through two 
essential steps:
The Specification of the Model Structure
Taking the case of the node “Learner” to illustrate the stages of development 
of our Bayesian network representing the model of the learner, notes that 
this node has three parent nodes (Pretest, Learning Activity and Evaluation), 
each of these nodes is composed of child nodes, links to these nodes are 
prerequisites relationships:
•	
Learning Activity: In this node, all students following the course must 
pass through activities, activities in the adaptive system is of two types: 
static and interactive.
•	
Pretest: All learner, and before taking the learning activities of each 
course must pass a pre-test, it consists of two types of evaluation:

79
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
◦◦
Knowledge: The student must answer more than 10 questions to 
measure how his wealth of knowledge. This evaluation reflects the 
evaluation part of the knowledge of the learner.
◦◦
Skills: This is a written proof that responds if the student can 
apply the knowledge gained in the module. This type of evaluation 
reflects the part of skills of the learner.
•	
Evaluation: After the student follows the learning activity, it is carried 
to conduct an evaluation to determine their level of knowledge and 
skill within the module, the evaluation is essential to guide the course 
of the learner.
The value that measures the relative importance of each condition varies 
from 0 to 1, the values of each evaluation element is defined by the teacher.
In other words, it is the weight of the arc from the parent node to the 
child node. All weights for the child variable will build its CPT. the sum of 
the weights of all arcs to / from each child node / parent in case of hidden 
variables / evidence should be 1. This means that each weight is normalized.
The relationship between the target variable (T) and the evidence variable 
(E) is to be from T to E because the process that calculates the posterior 
probability of target variable is the proof of knowledge of the diagnosis. So 
if variable evidence has no children, his parents must be the target variables. 
There are two types of relationships:
•	
Prerequisites Relations between target variables.
•	
Diagnostic Relations of target variables to evidence variables. The 
control of concepts (targets) effects on confidence of evidence. 
However, if the learner has failed a test, it is not sure of his lack of 
knowledge or ability because it can make an unexpected error.
The Specification of Variable Values
Once the use case diagrams were created, it is easy to create the structure 
of the Bayesian network using the rules described in the previous sections. 
Figure 6 represents the Bayesian network built from the use case diagram 
shown in the previous section. Note how the conditional independence was 
directly modeled by applying the rules as shown.

80
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
In the Bayesian network developed, we observe that the node Learner (L) 
has three parents: Learning Activity (A), Evaluation (E) and Pretest (T) which 
in turn are corresponding to three weights of prerequisite relationship: w1=0.1, 
w2=0.5, w3=0.4. Conditional probability of (L) is computed as follows:

EXPERIMENTATIONS
Lately, we will present in this section the validation tests of the Bayesian 
network derived from our model of the learner.
UnBBayes Software
UnBBayes (Costa et al., 2008) is a probabilistic network framework written 
in Java. It has both a GUI and an API with inference, sampling, learning and 
evaluation. It supports BN, ID, MSBN, OOBN, HBN, MEBN/PR-OWL, 
PRM, structure, parameter and incremental learning.
The JAVA UnBBayes uses a technique to reason by odds in intelligent 
systems. Through a probabilistic network - graph where the nodes are likely to 
variables representing domain knowledge and the arcs represent relationships 
Table 4. The conditional probability table of “Pretest” node

83
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
between them - from certain evidence, we can estimate probabilities 
conditioned to the evidence that assist us in decision making. This calculation 
is called probabilistic inference. With the addition of tree technique can be 
an inference in probabilistic networks with high efficiency.
To make this technique easy to use, we create the JAVA UnBBayes which 
is a visual system, interactive and platform independent, which makes it 
possible to edit, build networks, evidence of entry and probabilistic reasoning.
Metrics
In this section, and before presenting the results of our tests, we will introduce 
the metric through which we will measure the performance of Learner 
module modeled using Bayesian networks. The UnBBayes software gives 
us the possibility to evaluate the performance of each node in our network 
dynamically and in real time (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2017)
Here are the metrics we used to evaluate our Bayesian network:
•	
The Global Confusion Matrix (GCM): Computed for the selected 
target node and all the chosen evidence nodes.
•	
Probability of Correct Classification (PCC): The probability of 
correct classification computed from the GCM considering all evidence 
nodes.
Table 5. The conditional probability table of “Learning activity” node

84
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
•	
Marginal PCC (MPCC): The probability of correct classification 
computed from the GCM given all evidence nodes other than the one 
presented in the row (see “Node” column).
•	
Marginal Improvement (MI): The probability of correct classification 
gained by adding the node presented in the row to the rest of other 
nodes,
•	
Individual PCC (IPCC): The probability of correct classification 
computed from the LCM considering only the evidence presented in 
the row.
•	
Cost Rate: The individual probability of correct classification over the 
cost ratio.
The Combined Bayesian Network
Before presenting the evaluation results of each node of our Bayesian network 
that models the learner model in an adaptive system, we begin by presenting 
the combined Bayesian network through the UnBBayes software.
Figure 7 gives a mapping of the combined network, with marginal variables 
of each node of our network developed; we can observe the change in the 
marginal variables of each node in our network, simply by changing one or 
more marginal variable of one or multiple parent node of the selected node.
If we change the marginal variable “Succeed” of the node “konwledge” 
from 40% to 100%, and the marginal variable “Succeed” of the node “Skills” 
from 10% to 100%. We note that in Figure 7 the marginal variable “Succeed”, 
of the parent node “Pretest” will change from the initial state 50% into a total 
from of 100% completion. We will also notice that marginal variables of the 
parent’s node of the node “Pretest” which is the node “Learner” will also 
change from of 50% to 72.5%.
By changing the information of each node, and after compiling our network, 
all marginal variables will change automatically, which gives us the ability 
to track in a dynamic way the flow of the learners path and detect the causes 
of change during all stages of the situation of learning.
RESULTS
After compiling our Bayesian network, in this section will present all the 
results of our experiments on our Bayesian network.

85
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
Nodes Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of each node of our network and its contribution 
value within a single node, or the entire network, we first begin with choosing 
the node we want to evaluate as an evidence node, and choose the parent of 
this nodes as target nodes, then we will define a sample size that represents 
how often the software will repeat the simulations.
Figure 7. the Bayesian network combined of the learner model

86
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
The metrics presented in the previous section, we will evaluate the influence 
of each node within its parent node and within our entire Bayesian network 
built.
•	
Evaluation of the node “Pretest”
For the pretest node, there are two nodes Parent: Knowledge and Skills, 
we will choose the node pretest as a target node and its parents as evidences 
nodes, we will obtain the results shown in Figure 8.
From after the results in the table of results, we find that:
By adding evidence nodes into our evaluation of the target node the 
percentage of the probability of correct classifications increases. And by 
measuring the probability of correct classification of each node, we see how 
each node contributes independently to classification. In this evaluation, we 
find that the node “Skills” is the node that contributes the most.
We find how each node contributes with respect to the set of nodes in front 
of them. In this evaluation, the marginal improvement of the node “Skills” 
mean that the influence of this node is larger compared to the target node. 
We also note that even if the cost is the same, the marginal cost of the two 
different sensors, the sensor which in the most evolution is the marginal cost 
of the variables of the node “Skills”.
All of this reflects that the learner in this learning situation, to pass the 
pretest must rely more on skills than knowledge.
Figure 8. The evaluation results of the node pretest

87
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
•	
Evaluation of the node “Learning activity”
For the “Learning activity” node, there are two parents’ nodes: Static and 
Interactive, we will choose Learning activity as a target node and its parents 
as evidence nodes; we obtain the results shown in Figure 9.
From after the results in the table of results, we find that:
By adding evidence nodes into our evaluation of the target node the 
percentage of the probability of correct classifications increases. And by 
measuring the probability of correct classification of each node, we see how 
each node contributes independently to classification. In this evaluation, we 
find that the node “Static” is the node that contributes the most.
We find how each node contributes with respect to the set of nodes in front 
of them. In this evaluation, the marginal improvement of the node “Static” 
mean that the influence of this node is larger compared to the target node. 
We also note that even if the cost is the same, the marginal cost of the two 
different sensors, the sensor which in the most evolution is the marginal cost 
of the variables of the node “Static”.
All this reflects that the learner in the learning situation has follow a 
learning activity, the learner must focus on static activities grains more than 
the grains of interactive activities to increase the chances to him succeeding 
in this learning activity.
Figure 9. The evaluation results of the node learning activity

88
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
•	
Evaluation of the node “Learner”
For Learner node, there are three nodes Parent: pretest, Learning activity 
and Evaluation, by choosing Learner node as a target node and its parents as 
evidence nodes, we obtain the results shown in Figure 10.
From after the results in the table of results, we find that:
By adding evidence nodes into our evaluation of the target node the 
percentage of the probability of correct classifications increases. And by 
measuring the probability of correct classification of each node, we see how 
each node contributes independently to classification. In this evaluation, we 
find that the node “Learning activity” is the node that contributes the most.
We find how each node contributes with respect to the set of nodes in front 
of them. In this evaluation, the marginal improvement of the node “Learning 
activity” mean that the influence of this node is larger compared to the target 
node. We also note that even if the cost is the same, the marginal cost of the 
two different sensors, the sensor which in the most evolution is the marginal 
cost of the variables of the node “Learning activity “.
All this reflects that the success of a learner in the learning situation, 
concerns his success in the learning activity more than the assessment or 
pretest.
Figure 10. The evaluation results of the node Learner

89
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
The Evaluation of the Bayesian Network
After validation of each node of our learner model Bayesian network. We will 
present in this section the validation results of the entire Bayesian network.
Figure 11 presents the Bayesian network validation results. In this evaluation 
of our network, we will consider that the learner has successfully passed the 
pretest and the learning situation. The marginal variable of the node evaluation 
in this case will be 79.71%. The change of one of these two nodes will affect 
in a probabilistically the marginal variables of our network.
Based on the results and validation of each node of the Bayesian network, 
we were able to manage the operation of the network in a comprehensive 
manner.
When a learner begins to take a course in an adaptive hypermedia system, 
he must first successfully pass the functional requirement “Pretest” which is 
composed of two functional requirements that measures its knowledge and 
skills in the chosen field. After validation of the pretest, he is automatically 
assigned to the functional requirement “learning activity”, which is composed 
of two types, static and dynamic. During the end of the course, the learner is 
led to take an evaluation expressed in the functional requirement “Evaluation”, 
the result of this test takes the learner in case of failure to the functional 
requirement “Remediation” to retake the learning activities in which the 
student could not succeed.
Figure 11. The evaluation of the entire learner model’s Bayesian network

90
A Learner Model Based on Bayesian Networks in Educational Hypermedia Systems
Failure in a learning situation requires a tutor calls by activating the 
functional requirement “Call tutor”, which then activate two functional 
requirements “system awareness” and “Reading history learner”. These two 
requirements are related to features of hypermedia system.
CONCLUSION
We have shown how a theoretical point of view and considering the analysis 
of the literature, it seems justified to select Bayesian networks as an effective 
tool to manage learner model, The use of Bayesian networks as a formalizing 
to manage the problem of uncertainty for learner model in an adaptive 
educational system, gives us satisfaction results to address the problem of 
probabilistic and real-time management of all learner’s actions in a learning 
situation.
The experiments presented in this article are arguments in favor of our 
hypothesis on the modeling in a probabilistic way the learner model, using 
all the nodes as sensors to measure and evaluate the entire model.
The proposed rules for processing use case diagrams that schematizes the 
actions of a learner in an adaptive system can be applied to many use cases 
in different systems.
We see two main directions in which to continue this work. On the one 
hand by combining Bayesian networks with other modeling method of the 
learner, such as overlay models, on the other hand in transforming the Bayesian 
networks developed for the management of learner model into a machine-
readable language, such as ontologies. Or, as we already proposed (Anouar 
Tadlaoui et al., 2014; Anouar Tadlaoui et al, 2018) ; by using probabilistic 
ontologies as a formalism that gives us the possibility to combine Bayesian 
networks with ontologies.

ABSTRACT
This chapter aims to treat the problem of dynamic modeling in an adaptive 
educational system construed as computational modeling of the learner. 
Modeling the learner in adaptive systems involves different information such as 
knowledge of the domain, the performance of the learning goals, background, 
learning styles, etc. Although there are several methods to manage the learner 
model, like the stereotype model or learner profiles, they do not handle the 
uncertainty in the dynamic modeling of the learner. The main purpose of this 
chapter is to show the link between the structure of the learner model and 
the characteristics of a learning profile and the learning style of a learning 
situation. This chapter shows how the combination of these two approaches 
to learner modeling can address the dynamic aspect of the problem in the 
modeling of the learner. The experiments and results presented in this work 
are arguments in favor of the hypothesis and can also promote reusing the 
modeling obtained through different systems and similar modeling situations.

The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
INTRODUCTION
Despite the different attempts to model the learning that is characterized by a 
dynamic aspect, we always find it difficult to achieve this goal. The proposed 
approaches give us just a static view of the learner model, but on practice this 
model is in full development (the learner knowledge is evolving in the same 
module). Thus, a dynamic view is essential. Therefore, in order to monitor 
the behavior of the learner in real time during a learning situation; we must 
adopt a model for dynamic management of the learning model.
The overlay model responds to the problem of dynamic management of 
learner model by showing knowledge of the learner as a subset of the knowledge 
of the system. We also presented in a previous work (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 
2014) how Bayesian networks are considered an effective tool to manage the 
problem of uncertainty in the model of the learner.
Our work focuses on identifying learning styles in different learning 
situations. More generally, it focuses on the initialization of a learner model 
in an adaptive educational hypermedia system. The main objective of this 
article is modeling the learner by combining Bayesian networks, and the 
overlay model. We aim in this chapter to use the combination of these two 
methods, to determine the learning style of each learner in a probabilistic way 
during the learning situation. And to achieve the, a dynamic e-assessment of 
each learner based on the learning styles determined.
First, we present the concepts and definitions of the learner’s model and 
the learning styles on which we will base our work. Second, we will define 
Bayesian networks and overlay model. Then, we will focus on the combination 
rules on which we based our work to incorporate Bayesian networks with the 
overlay model. Afterwards, we demonstrate with an example of a learning 
situation the validity of this combination. Finally, we describe a formal 
structure for the definition of each learning style for a learning situation. 
The experiments and results presented in this work are arguments in favor 
of our hypothesis. This combination can promote also reusing the modeling 
obtained through systems and similar situations.

LEARNER MODELLING IN ADAPTIVE 
EDUCATIONAL HYPERMEDIAS
The learner modeling is the modeling of all the important features that affect 
the learner (knowledge, preferences, goals, etc.). The purpose of modeling 
the learner is to identify relevant information, to structure, to initialize, to 
update, and to exploit them. By replacing the word “learning” with the term 
“user” this definition is also applicable to the model of the user. In the case 
of an application other than the learner’s educational model, it is called the 
user model.
The learner model can be an integral part of Adaptive Hypermedia Systems 
as it can be shared with multiple systems. In the latter case we speak of user 
modeling servers (Yudelson et al., 2007). This type of server areused in 
distributed environments whereadaptive systems can access this server to 
query or update user information. Cumulate (Brusilovsky et al., 2005) is one 
of the most known and used systems for user modeling servers.
The Role of a Learner Model
We will describe in this section the difference between the term “learner 
profile” and the term “learner model.”
The learner profile is a collection of personal information of the learner. 
This information is recorded without any description or interpretation. Learner 
profiles represent the essential information of the learner, such as cognitive 
skills, skills, intentions, learning styles, preferences, and interactions of the 
learner with the system. The modeling of this information stored gives us 
the model of the learner (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2016)
Figure 1 represents the process of adaptation a learner adaptive system 
goes through. The learner information changes over time, depending on the 
content and amount of information about the user, which is stored in the 
user profile. Besides, a user can be modeled. Thus, the user profile is used 
to retrieve the necessary information to build a model of the learner. Koch 
(2000), describes a user model as the representation of the beliefs of the 
system about the user. The user of the “real world” is perceived by the system 
through the human-machine interface.

98
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
A profile contains personal information without deduction or interpretation. 
The learner modelis considered as an abstract view of the learner, thus it is a 
higher level conceptualization of the learner. In addition, the learner model is 
able to deduct additional information about the learner. The learner model is 
based upon such information and is therefore only a small part of the actual 
learning. Nevertheless, the learner model must represent the necessary 
characteristics of the learner in the context of the education system.
The Components of a Learner Model
The components of a learner model are stored information that can be 
analyzed and grouped according to the different levels of information. These 
components are connected to the application of the learner model. There are 
two types of components in the model of the learner:
•	
The Performance Model: That stores data sets related to assessments 
of learner skills (Zhou et al., 1999).
•	
The Model of Learning History: That follows specific types of data 
presented to the learner during the use of the system, and measures 
system knowledge level based on the history of the interaction with the 
interface (Jeremi´c et al., 2004).
Figure 1. Learner’s profile and learner model in adaptation

99
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
According to Zhou (1999), it is necessary to add additional components 
to provide complete information about the learner. Such as: the history of 
responses and a balance the sheet of solutions. The learner answers history 
is attached to each instruction’s unit; it stores information about the learning 
items and the learner responses during a learning situation. The number of 
errors and descriptions of these errors during the problem solving process 
are stored in the solution or the balance sheet.
Another approach proposed by Castillo (2003) isto divide the learner model 
into several components. More specifically,in three components: a profile, a 
model of cognitive overlay, and a model of course overlay.
The Contents of a Learner Model
According to Self (1991), a complete learner model must contain information 
about the domain knowledge of the learner, his preferences, key goals, interests, 
his progress,amongother information. All this information is essential for the 
use of the systems.
Brusilovsky (2001) states that learners models can be classified according 
to the nature and form of the information contained in the models. Taking 
the example of a subject area, the information stored in the learner model is 
composed of two areas of information: the specific domain of information 
and independent domain of information. Figure 2 shows the components of 
each information domain, the combination of these two areas of information 
provides a complete view of learners for adaptive systems.
Figure 2. Learner domains of information

100
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
Specific Domain of Information
The specific domain of information is a reflection on the level of knowledge 
and skills of a learner in a learning situation.
Brusilovsky (2001) gives the name of the specific domain of information 
to the model of a specific area.The knowledge model can be based on the 
combination of two or more initialization methods and models such as: scalar 
model, the overlay model, error model, genetic model, etc.In this work we will 
not state explicitelyabout these initialization method of the domain model, but 
we will return in the following section into some of thesemethods to explain 
the initialization of a learner model.
It addition, the specific domain of information stores other information 
relatedto the learner in a specific area, the learner modelstores theseinformation, 
such as:
•	
The requirements in the area of learning to the learner.
•	
An archive of information on learning activities.
•	
An archive on the assessments and tests.
Independent Domain of Information
In addition to storing the level of current knowledge of a learner, independent 
domain of information deals with enabling adaptability. The independent 
area information on a learner includes:
•	
Goals: To specify the learning strategies, it is important to know 
the goals of the learner. The goal can be divided into two different 
types: first, the learning goal, which is relatively stable for a training 
unit;second, the problem-solving purpose, which can change from one 
problem to another even within the same learning situation.
•	
Cognitive Apptitudes: Cognitive skills are the intellectual capacity to 
different kinds of cognitive performance. For example, musical ability, 
mathematical ability, etc.
•	
Motivational States: To measure training in teaching the learner’s 
motivational state is used. Motivation is measured using a number of 
long-term and short-term parameters. These parameters are for example 
the effort, attention, interest, distraction, persistence, etc. These 
parameters are related to other factors such as the level of knowledge, 
preparation, the complexity of the subject, and the learning outcomes.

101
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
•	
Background and Experience: To derive the model parameters of the 
learner, information about the background and experience are used. 
General information includes skills that can influence the achievement 
of learning. Such information is, for example, occupation, work 
experience or perspectives.
•	
Preferences: Learners may have different preferences related to aspects 
of the learning environment. These preferences are considered non-
inducible system. Thus, the learner must inform the system directly or 
indirectly from his or her preferences
Learner’s Learning Styles
In this section, we will present the learning styles of the learner, which are 
part of the domain of independent information. Based on the importance of 
learning styles in education area, and their influence on the learner’s learning 
path. We see that it is the perfect ground to test our hypothesis to combine the 
overlay model and Bayesian networks to manage the domain of independent 
information of the learner model.
Research (Brusilovsky et al., 2001) in the field of education shows us 
that we tend to teach based on our own learning style. I.e., if our learners 
have a different learning style than us, then there will be difficulties ahead. 
It would therefore be relevant to any guardian to become familiar with the 
different learning styles for the simple reason that it will help them become 
more effective guardians.
David Kolb (1984) is an educator who has contributed much to the study 
of learning styles. His researches on adult learning styles have shown that 
adults, although they are continually learning, tend to favor a learning mode.
This does not mean that they have only one way to learn, but that they learn 
better with a particular approach. Kolb (2005) identified, from the various 
modes of learning, four learning styles represented in Figure 3.
Accommodating Style
The learner in this category is mainly taught by “manipulation”, i.e., by 
performing tasks. Therefore he: likes to be involved in the planning and 
implementation of activities; tends to solve problems by trial / error rather 
than logic; tends to rely on the thoughts of others rather than on its own 
analysis; agrees to take risks.

102
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
The types of activities that interest learners that prefer this style are:
•	
Games and role playing;
•	
Participation in activities and exercises in small groups;
•	
Exchange of comments.
Diverging Style
This type of learner has a strong sense of observation: he is clever to perceive 
an object or problem from different angles; he excels in innovative activities 
such as brainstorming sessions; he has a vivid imagination and varied interests; 
he is interested in people and attaches great importance to feelings.
The types of activities that interest this learner are:
•	
Learning from new experiences: role playing, games, etc.;
•	
Exchange and discuss with peers;
•	
Follow tutoring;
•	
Observe, synthesize and draw conclusions.
Assimilating Style
This learner is skilled at reorganizing logically disparate information. He tends 
to prefer to juggle ideas and theories rather than their practical application.
The types of activities that interest this leaner are:
Figure 3. Description of Kolb’s learning styles

103
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
•	
The theoretical courses;
•	
Objectives examinations;
•	
Reading about different theories.
Converging Style
This learner is eligible to apply ideas and theories, solve problems, and 
make decisions. He prefers, however, to solve problems that have a unique 
solution. Finally, it is easier for him to perform technical tasks than engaging 
in interpersonal or social controversies.
The types of activities that interest this learner are:
•	
Failure directed study time;
•	
Case studies;
•	
Projects and self-directed individual activities.
The Representation of the Learner Model
The learner model is used primarily to provide a structure for the representation 
of domain knowledge of the learner. According to Koch (2000), the data 
concerning the learner can be represented in different ways. Using different 
methods (steotypes, bayesian networks…) or differents models (overlay 
model, diffrentiel model, perturbation modeles …)
Overlay Models
The main idea of overlay models is that the learner model is a subset of the 
domain model. In other words, the learner overlay model is a partof the full 
domain model. Figure 4 represents the relationships between the different 
concepts of a domain model.
A domain model consists of a set of knowledge elements representing the 
knowledge of expertise; each element represents a concept, a topic, or a theme 
in a major field. Thus, the model structure of the learner “mimics” the domain 
model structure. However, each model element of the learner (corresponding 
to each domain model element) has a specific value measuring the knowledge 
of the user of this element. This value is considered the mastery of the domain 
element included in a certain range. Simply, the domain is decomposed into 
a set of elements and the overlay model (learner model) is a set of the more 

104
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
mastered elements. Suppose that mastery level of each element ranges from 
0 (not mastered) to 1 (mastered). The expert model is the superposition with 
1 for each element and the learner model is the superposition 1 at most for 
each element.
The overlay modeling approach was based on the domain models which are 
often constructed as a knowledge network or hierarchical tree of knowledge. 
Experts are the authors with the responsibility to create the domain model. 
Normally, each concept in the domain model is mapped to a learning object. 
Today there is a tendency to build the domain model using ontologies.(Anouar 
Tadlaoui et al., 2014).
User Profiles
They are used to represent the cognitive skills, intellectual abilities, intentions, 
learning, or preferences of a user’s style. Each ability is associated with a 
value, that value belongs to a range of values.
Stereotyped Models
In this type; the model knowledge of the learner and the properties are also 
represented with a pair of values. The stereotypical model is different from 
the other models in that it models different pairs of values that are assigned 
to a user category (stereotype) as novice, intermediate, or expert. So a user 
inherits from each property to its stereotype. Stereotyped models can be 
combined with the recovery models when a stereotype is assigned to a user 
model for initialization. Stereotyped models are useful for modeling the 
learner but not enough when the individual adaptation requires a more precise 
description of the learner.

BAYESIAN NETWORKS
Knowledge representation and reasoning from these representations has 
created many models. Probabilistic graphical models, specifically Bayesian 
networks initiated by Pearl (1988) in the 1980s, have proven to be useful 
tools for representing uncertain knowledge and reasoning from incomplete 
information.

Thus, the graphical part of the Bayesian network indicates the dependencies 
(or independence) between variables and provides a visual tool for knowledge 
representation, more easily comprehensible by its users. In addition, the 
use of probability allows taking into account uncertainty in quantifying the 
dependencies between variables. Both properties have been the cause of the 
first names of Bayesian networks, “probabilistic expert systems”, where the 
graph was compared to the set of rules of conventional expert system, and 
the conditional probabilities presented as a quantification uncertainty about 
the rules.
Mayo and Mitrovic (2001) also have shown that Bayesian networks 
allow representing compactly the joint probability distribution over the set 
of variables:

This decomposition of a global function as a local product terms depending 
only of the node and its parents in the graph is a fundamental property of 
Bayesian networks. It is the basis of the first work on the development of 

106

inference algorithms, which calculate the probability of any variable of the 
model from the same partial observation of other variables. This has been 
proven NP-complete, but resulted in different algorithms that can be treated 
as information propagation methods in a graph. These methods obviously 
use the concept of conditional probability, i.e. what is the probability of Xi  
knowing that Xj  has been observed, but also the Bayes theorem, that calculates, 
conversely, the probability of Xj  knowing Xi  when P Xi Xj
(
|
) is known.
Bayesian Networks Construction
As we have seen in the definition, the complete specification of a Bayesian 
network requires specifying a part of its structure (directed acyclic graph 
that underlies) and other parameters (probability tables). To do this, two 
approaches are possible and can be combined: the collection of expertise 
and machine learning, which is one of the attractions of Bayesian networks.
In the case of collection of expertise, the definition of the network structure 
begins with the identification of possible nodes and the distinction between 
(unobservable) informational variables (inputs) or hypothetical. The existence 
of an arc can be analyzed in terms of influence of one variable on another, 
but its orientation is more difficult. Traditionally, an arc is directed from 
A to B if A is a cause of B, but we will see that this interpretation is not as 
simple in the case of the learner modeling. The parameters are defined in an 
approximate manner by using frequentists or qualitative information.
Since Bayesian network is a probability distribution, we can use maximum 
likelihood as statistical learning parameters criterion.
The result obtained is then a Bayesian network whose structure is fixed and 
in which E is a complete example base, the maximum likelihood is achieved 
if the parameters of the Bayesian network are equal to the frequencies of the 
same configurations observed in E.
Statistical learning of the structure requires the development of a test to 
determine whether or not the random variables are conditionally independent
Applying Bayesian Networks Into the Overlay Model
The basic idea of the overlay model is that the user model is the domain 
model subset. The field is divided into a set of knowledge elements and the 
overlay model is simply a set of elements mastered by the user. Suppose that 
mastery of each element ranges from 0 (unchecked) to 1 (mastered) in the 

107
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
overlay model. The relationship of A for B is often prior relationship, so we 
can deduce that the user must understand A before learning B.
Although the overlay model is a simple but powerful approach to represent 
a user model, it does not provide a way to deduce the knowledge of the user 
from the evidence collected in the learning process (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 
2015)
Bayesian Network’s Combination Rules
The learner modeling based on the overlay model should be associated with 
other probabilistic approaches to solve this problem and Bayesian networks are 
the best fit So we tried to combine in this work the Bayesian network and the 
recovery model through the transformation of the overlay model’s structure, 
the transformation of the prior relationships, and the transformation of the 
knowledge elements. The following sections describe these transformations.
The Transformation of the Overlay Model’s Structure
The structure of the overlay model is a directed acyclic graph, same as a 
Bayesian network. We will consider this structure as a Bayesian network in 
our combination where the knowledge elements will become the nodes of 
the Bayesian network.
Instead of using the weight of each item, we will assign the probability for 
each estimation variable of mastery of knowledge. All variables are binary 
(0 means not mastered and 1means mastered).
Prior Relationships Transformation
The prior relationships between knowledge elements are known as conditional 
statements in dependence Bayesian network. Therefore, each node has a 
conditional probability table (CPT), which gives the probability of each value 
given every possible combination of values for its parents.
Knowledge Elements Transformation
All knowledge elements will be defined as target variables and all other 
learning objects that are used to evaluate the performance of the learner in 
the process of learning (tests, exams, exercises, and activities in the case 
studies) will be considered as variables of evidence.

108
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
Then we will add these variables into the Bayesian network after determining 
the conditional dependency relationships between target variables and all 
their evidence. We stated that the values of the target nodes will change if 
the evidence nodes changes.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF BAYESIAN NETWORK 
COMBINING THE OVERLAY MODEL
After completing the three steps described above, the development of Bayesian 
network for a learning situation goes through two key steps: the specification 
of the structure model and the specification of the variables’ values, which 
are described in the following sections.
The Specification of the Structure Model
In this section, we will take an example of a learning situation to illustrate 
and test our hypothesis. To illustrate a learner model, imagine the “Database” 
module with three main concepts (the Database Management System - DBMS, 
the relational model, and the database design), in this chapter, we will focus 
especially on the module database design to evaluate the Bayesian network 
in a real contest based on the result of the students in this module. The 
relationships of these concepts are prerequisite relationships. In addition, the 
evaluation of the database design element is composed of two types:
•	
Knowledge: The learner must answer more than 10 questions to 
measure his knowledge on the concept. This assessment reflects the 
knowledge acquired about the theory of that concept.
•	
Skills: This is a written proof that assesses whether the learner can 
apply the knowledge gained in the module to achieve a design of a 
database. This type of evaluation reflects the part of knowledge of the 
learner. We’re talking about the first step towards assessing learner’s 
skills in this module.
Figure 5 represent the Bayesian network of our learning situation combined 
with the overlay model. The structure of overlay model is considered as 
Bayesian network. Thus, knowledge elements in domain become variables 
(or nodes) in Bayesian network.

109
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
Instead of using the weight of each element as above, we assign the 
probability to each variable for estimating the mastery of knowledge. All 
variables are binary (0 – not mastered and 1 – mastered). Note, knowledge 
item, knowledge element and concept are synonymic terms. The prerequisite 
relationships between knowledge elements are known as the conditional 
dependence assertions in Bayesian network. Accordingly, each node has a CPT.
The value that measures the relative importance of each condition varies 
from 0 to 1, the values of each evaluation element are defined by an expert, 
and in this case we are considering the teacher as the expert.
In other words, it is the weight of the arc from the parent node to the 
child node. All weights for the child variable will build its CPT. the sum of 
the weights of all arcs to / from each child node / relative in case of hidden 
variables / evidence should be 1. This means that each weight is normalized.
The relationship between the target variable (T) and the evidence variable 
(E) must be from T to E because the process that calculates the posterior 
probability of target variable is the proof of knowledge of the diagnosis. So 
the evidence variable has no children and its parents must be target variables. 
There are two types of relationships:
•	
Prior Relations: Between target variables.
•	
Diagnostic Relations: Of target variables to the evidence variables. 
The control of concepts (targets) effects on confidence of evidence. 
However, if the learner has failed a test, it does not necessarily mean 
that he has no knowledge or ability on the subject.

The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
The Specification of the Variables’ Values
The example structured in Figure 5 represents the Bayesian network integrated 
into the overlay model of a learning situation. The network is developed 
according to the rules explained in the precedents sections. In this example, 
the node Database (D) has three parents: Database Management System

EXPERIMENTATION
After building our Bayesian network combining the overlay model, we will 
try to validate and justify our approach by testing it in a real context. For that, 
we have chosen the class of second year of DUT (Diplôme Universitaire de 
Technologie, Technical University Degree in English), at the Ecole Normal 
Superieure of Abdelmalek Essaadi University. The students have taking the 
test to determine the values on which we have based our probabilistic inference 
to each module and the initial rate of success to each element of the module. 
All the tests have been presented by the teachers of the modules.
Before presenting our experimentation on the Bayesian network developed. 
We will start by presenting the framework in which we will evaluate our 
approach, and then we will present the metrics in which we will base the 
evaluation. And then, we will present the combined Bayesian network and 
its performance evaluation.
Software UnBBayes
UnBBayes (Costa et al., 2008; Matsumoto et al., 2008) is a probabilistic 
network framework written in Java. It has both a GUI and an API with 
inference, sampling, learning, and evaluation. It supports Bayesian network 
(BN), Influence Diagram (ID), Multiple-Sectioned Bayesian Network 
(MSBN), Hybrid Bayesian Network (HBN), Object-Oriented Bayesian 
Network (OOBN), Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM), Multi-Entity 
Bayesian Network (MEBN), Probabilistic Web Ontology Language (PR-
OWL), structure, parameter and incremental learning.
UnBBayes uses a technique to reason by odds in intelligent systems. Through 
a probabilistic graphical model, where the nodes are variables representing 
domain knowledge and the arcs represent relationships between them, and 
some evidence, we can estimate probabilities conditioned to the evidence that 
assist us in decision making. This calculation is called probabilistic inference.

Metrics
In this section, and before presenting the results of our tests, we will present 
the metrics by which we will measure the performance of our learning situation 
modeled with the combination of Bayesian networks with the overlay model. 
The UnBBayes software gives us the opportunity to evaluate the performance 
of each node in our network dynamically and in real time.
This is the metrics (Costa et al., 2008) we used to evaluate our Bayesian 
network:
•	
The Global Confusion Matrix (GCM): Computed for the selected 
target node and all the chosen evidence nodes.
•	
Probability of Correct Classification (PCC): The probability of 
correct classification computed from the GCM considering all evidence 
nodes.
•	
Marginal PCC (MPCC): The probability of correct classification 
computed from the GCM given all evidence nodes other than the one 
presented in the row.
•	
Marginal Improvement (MI): The probability of correct classification 
gained by adding the node presented in the row to the rest of other 
nodes.
•	
Individual PCC (IPCC): The probability of correct classification 
computed from the global confusion matrix computed for the selected 
target node and considering only the evidence presented in the row.
•	
Cost Rate: The individual probability of correct classification over the 
cost ratio.
The Combined Bayesian Network
Before presenting the evaluation results of each node of our Bayesian network 
combining the overlay model to model the learner in an adaptive system, we 
begin by presenting the combined Bayesian network through the UnBBayes 
software.
Figure 6 gives a mapping of the combined system with the marginal 
probabilities for each variable in the developed network. By entering evidence, 
we can update the posterior probabilities of all variables in the network, as 
shown in Figure 6.

114
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
In Figure 6, we present the Bayesian network obtained after the change 
of the marginal variables in both the parent nodes “Knowledge” and “Skills” 
of the “Database_Design” node.
By changing the marginal variables of both nodes from its initial percentage 
into 100%, we are telling the model that the learner has passed both of the 
evaluations successfully. With this evidence; we observe a change in the 
posterior probability of both “Database_Design” and “Database” variables. 
The posterior probability for the “Succeded” state has been updated to 100% 
and 71%, for the variables “Database_Design” and “Database”, respectively.
Therefore, this means that the success of each learner in the given basic 
module is strongly related to the success he had in mastering the “Database_
Design” module.

Performance Evaluation
Before evaluating the performance of our developed Bayesian network, we 
will first evaluate the performance of each node in our network. Using the 
UnBBayes software and evaluation metrics presented in the previous section.
Nodes Evaluation
•	
Evaluation of the node “Database_Design”
For “Database_Design” node, there are two children nodes: “Knowledge” 
and “Skills” is selecting the “Database_Design” node as a target node and 
the children nodes as evidence, the results are presented in Figure 7.
Based on the evaluation of our Bayesian network fragment, we find:
By adding evidence nodes into our evaluation of the target node the 
percentage of the probability of correct classifications increases. Besides, by 
measuring the probability of correct classification for each node computed 
from the GCM given all evidence nodes other than the one presented in the 
row, we see how each node contributes independently to classification. In 
this evaluation, we find that the MPCC of the node “Skills” is 84.25% and 
the MPCC of the node “Knowledge” is 55.20%, which means that the node 
“Skills” is the node that contributes the most.
Figure 7. Evaluation of the node “Database_Design

116
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
Based on the probability of correct classification gained by adding the 
node presented in the row to the rest of other nodes. We find that the marginal 
improvement of the node “Skills” is 30.80% and for the node “Knowledge”, 
the marginal improvement is of 1.75%. This means that the node “Skills” has 
the most influence compared to the target node. We also note that even if 
the cost is the same, based on the marginal cost of the two different sensors, 
the sensor which in the most influence on the evolution of the node is the 
node “Skills”.
All this reflects the success of a learner in this module’s element, is based 
more about his success in the type of evaluation that evaluates his skills more 
than the evaluation that concerns his knowledge.
•	
Evaluation of the node “Database”
For the “Database” node, there are three children nodes: “DBMS”, 
“Relational_Model” and “Database_Design”. By choosing the “Database” 
node as a target node and its children as evidence, we obtain the results 
shown in Figure 8.
Based on the evaluation of our Bayesian network fragment, we find:
By adding evidence nodes into our evaluation of the target node the 
percentage of the probability of correct classifications increases. Besides, by 
measuring the probability of correct classification for each node computed 
Figure 8. Evaluation of the node “Database”

117
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
from the GCM given all evidence nodes other than the one presented in the 
row, we see how each node contributes independently to classification. In 
this evaluation, we find that the MPCC of the node “Database_design” is 
59.10%, the MPCC of the node “Relational_Model” is 64.42% and for the 
node “DBMS”, the MPCC is 73.35% which means that the node “DBMS” is 
the node that contributes the most.
Based on the probability of correct classification gained by adding the 
node presented in the row to the rest of other nodes. We find that the marginal 
improvement of the node “Database_design” is 14.30% and for the node 
“Relational_Model”, the marginal improvement is of 8.98%, and 0.06% for 
the marginal improvement of the node “DBMS”.. This means that the node 
“Database_design” has the most influence compared to the target node. We 
also note that even if the cost is the same, based on the marginal cost of the 
two different sensors, the sensor which in the most influence on the evolution 
of the node is the node “Database_design”.
All this reflects the success of a learner in this module relates more success 
in the database design element more than the other elements of the module.
Bayesian Network Evaluation
After the validation of each node of the Bayesian network, we will present 
in this section the validation results of the entire Bayesian network.
Figure 9. Evaluation of the entire Bayesian network

118
The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
Figure 9 presents the entire Bayesian network validation results in a 
comprehensive manner. In this network evaluation, we assume that the learner 
has successfully passed both elements “DBMS” and “Relational_Module” by 
affecting both nodes the condition for success in the evaluation. The marginal 
variable nodes evaluation in this case will be 66.43%. The change of one of 
these two nodes affect a probabilistically marginal our network variables.
Based on the results and validation of each node of the Bayesian network, 
we were able to manage the operation of the network in a comprehensive 
manner. The success of a learner in this module relates more success in the 
database design element more than the other elements of the module. This 
means that the adequate learning style for this module is “the converging style”.
DISCUSSION
In this learning situation, the success of the learner in the database management 
module relates to his success in the evaluation that tests his skills more than 
the evaluation that test his level of knowledge. This means that the success 
of the learner in the learning situation is related on his skills more than on 
his knowledge.
By returning to the learning styles of Kolb, described in the first section 
of this article, the learning style appropriate to the learner in the learning 
situation is the converging style. The learner is competent to practice ideas 
and theories, solve problems and make decisions. He prefers, however, to 
solve problems whose solution is unique.
The experiment presented in this work can be applied to any situation that 
learning in hypermedia systems or even in any e-learning system, starting 
first by determining the profile of the learner after the passage of a pre-test, 
and then perform the same test presented in this work to derive the learner 
profile suitable for each learning situation. Finally, to assign every learning 
situation to the learner based on the adequate profile.
By using Bayesian networks to determine dynamically the right profile of 
each learner before entering the learning situation, and assigning each learner 
to the right learning situation according to the learning style determined. The 
work presented in this chapter is the first step to achieve a well structured 
computer based assessment, in which we could track the evolution of each 
learner in the educational hypermedia, without limiting his actions to mainly 
Boolean actions (true/false).

The Determination of Learning Using Bayesian Network and the Overlay Model
CONCLUSION
The user model is an essential element in adaptive e-learning systems. 
The adaptation of an e-learning system mainly involves the selection and 
presentation of each successive teaching activity according to the full scope of 
the learner’s knowledge of the subject taught and other relevant characteristics 
of the learner, which are also kept in the learner model. As a result, the learner 
model is used to change the interaction between the system and the student 
to meet the individual needs of the students.
We have shown how in a theoretical perspective, and by applying and testing 
our hypothesis in a specific case, that the combination of overlay model and 
Bayesian networks is an appropriate approach for the management of learning 
styles of learner in adaptive hypermedia systems. The experiments presented 
in this article are arguments in favor of our hypothesis on the modeling in a 
probabilistic way to design the learner model, using all the nodes as sensors 
to measure and evaluate the module of learner.
This approach may be difficult if a high number of data is stored in the 
system. That is why we proposed in previous works (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 
2017;Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2015; Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2018) the use of 
Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN) to try to cover all the data even if 
the number of stored data is high and unknown.
This chapter contains a new probabilistic way to model the learner model 
in adaptive educational hypermedia, using a combination of methods and 
techniques to develop a complete learner model and updating it in real time. 
The results and models presented in this research insight would be considered 
as a frame work to a lot of upcoming works in adaptive web.
We see two main directions in which to continue this work. On the one 
hand this method includes formal analysis of learning styles in adaptive 
educational hypermedia system, that would lead us to a full e-assessment 
based on the action of the learner during the learning situation and not only 
his/her background knowledge when he enters the system. On the other hand 
in turns Bayesian networks developed for the management of learner model 
into a readable language by machines, such as ontologies, or as we already 
proposed before, using probabilistic ontologies as a formalism that gives us 
the possibility to combine Bayesian networks with ontologies.

ABSTRACT
This chapter aims to propose a new way to initialize a learner model in adaptive 
educational hypermedia systems. Learner modelling in adaptive systems 
contains several indicators. Even if there are several methods for initializing 
the learner model, they do not manage the side of uncertainty in the dynamic 
modeling of the learner. The main purpose of this chapter is the initialization 
of the learner model based on the combination of the Bayesian networks and 
the stereotypes method. In order to carry out a complete initialization of this 
model, the authors propose to use a combination of the stereotype method to 
process the content of the specific domain of information and the Bayesian 
networks to process the contents of the independent domain of information. 
The experiments and results presented in this work are arguments in favor of 
the hypothesis and can promote also reusing the modeling obtained through 
different systems and similar modeling situations.

The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
INTRODUCTION
The user module is an essential component for Adaptive e-Learning systems. 
The term adaptation in e-learning systems involves the selection and the 
manner of presentation of each learning activity as a function focused on the 
entity having of knowledge and skills and other information given by each 
subject taught (Yudelson et al., 2007)
Despite the different attempts to model the learning that is characterized 
by a dynamic aspect, we always find it difficult to achieve this goal (Anouar 
Tadlaoui et al., 2016). The proposed approaches give us just a static view 
of the learner model, but on practice this model is in full development (the 
learner knowledge is evolving in the same module). Thus, a dynamic view 
is essential. Therefore, in order to monitor the behavior of the learner in 
real time during a learning situation; we must adopt a model for dynamic 
management of the learning model (Brusilovsky et al., 2005; Zaitseva et al., 
2005; Han, 2001)
The structure of this chapter consists on combining Bayesian networks 
with stereotypes method to initialize the learner model in AHES. To 
achieve that goal, we will firstly, return to the notions and definitions of the 
learner’s model, the process of its development, its domains of information 
and their contents, and then we will concentrate on the Bayesian networks, 
their definitions and their rules of construction. Then, we will explain our 
approach for the initialization of the learner model based on a combination 
of the stereotype method and the Bayesian networks, precisely the field of 
intervention of each method and their expected results. Finally, and in order 
to disclose the validity of our hypothesis; we will present the experiments and 
the tests carried out. The results obtained from these experiments presented 
in this work are all arguments in favor of our hypothesis. This combination 
also promotes its reuse in the step of updating the learner model in different 
adaptive educational hypermedia systems.
THE INITIALIZATION OF THE LEARNER 
MODEL IN THE AHES
We will concern this part to the initialization of the model of the learner in 
the AHES, begin by describing the process of initialization of the model 

126
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
that we will propose by combining the Bayesian networks as we presented 
in the preceding chapters and the stereotypes in order to achieve a complete 
initialization in all aspects are understood.
The Process of Initializing the Learner Model
The initialization of the learner model represents the process of gathering 
information about the learner and transferring this information to the model. 
This process of initialization represents a major problem for adaptive systems.
In this section, we will present our process of collecting data about the 
learner. According to Self (1991), the learner model can be initialized in 
three ways, using explicit questions, initial tests, or the method of stereotypes.
Figure 1 shows our proposed process for collecting learner data. We 
propose in this chapter the use of two methods simultaneously to gather all 
the information related to the learner, which will give us a more complete 
learner model, and this will be reflected on the adaptation of the system to 
the needs of the learner in a more precise way.
Figure 1. The process of initializing the learner model

127
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
To achieve this goal, we will use two methods for data collection: explicit 
questions, and initial tests.
In order to gather specific information about the learner that makes up 
the learner’s profile, such as personal information, goals, cognitive skills, 
preferences ... we will base this process on explicit questions, which will 
guide us in assigning each learner to a well-defined stereotype.
And for independent learner information, which reflects its level of 
knowledge and skills for each module in the system, and which represent 
the key element for system adaptation. We base this process on initial tests, 
using Bayesian networks as a formalism to properly represent and manage 
this information in a probabilistic way.
Building the Learner Profile
Initial learner models are often constructed directly by direct questioning 
of the learner as soon as he or she enters the system and before he or she 
has been affected into a learning situation. This method is considered very 
effective for collecting general information about the learner, the problem 
encountered using this method, is to find a number of appropriate questions 
to collect consistent information about the learner taking into consideration 
that the increase of the number of questions can irritate the learner and 
increase the declination to the system, which can create a situation where the 
learner leaves the system and never returns. According to Tsiriga (Tsiriga & 
Virvou, 2003), the dependence on this method alone does not allow sufficient 
extraction of information for the initialization of a learner model.
In order to answer this problem of the numbers of questions for the extraction 
of the data on the learner, we propose to use the stereotypes method to group 
the learners in categories. Stereotypes would concede a very powerful method 
to provide considerable information based on initial observations.
Stereotypes: Definition and Characteristic
In general, stereotypes represent a category or group of learners. There are 
two types of stereotypes: Fixed and default.
In fixed stereotypes, the learner is assigned a predefined stereotype at 
an abstract level. For example: in a module, learners are divided into four 
groups, corresponding to four levels (novice, beginner, advanced and expert) 
each level is more difficult than the previous level: After obtaining individual 
information such as: knowledge, experience, skills ... the system attributes 

128
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
each learner one of the four levels and it will never change in this type of 
stereotype.
In default stereotypes, the system is more flexible. Therefore, first, 
the learner is assigned to the initial stereotype. This means that the initial 
stereotype has a “default” value. The system will observe the learners and 
collect their performance data, test results ... during the learning process. 
Finally, the system will modify the initial stereotype to new stereotype more 
appropriate. Simply, the default stereotype setting is gradually replaced by 
a more accurate stereotype for the learner.
There are three important elements in a stereotype: triggering, inference 
and retraction:
•	
Trigger: Is used to activate a stereotype. In other words, it is a condition 
for assigning a stereotype to the learner.
•	
Inference: Is an engine, responsible for inferring information related 
to the learner.
•	
Retraction: Are the conditions used to disable the stereotype of the 
learner. There is a circumstance.
The Process of Building a Learner Profile
Figure 2 shows an overall view of the process of building our profile of each 
learner. As soon as the learner enters the system, the system will ask the learner 
a set of questions about his personal information, and then he will receive 
answers on these questions. This responses will be then stored in the system.
After one or more of these responses (which represent triggers or 
stereotypes), one or more stereotypes will be activated. These stereotypes will 
Figure 2. The process of building a learner profile

129
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
group a group of learners into specific categories according to well-defined 
characteristics. All of these stereotypes will build a profile of the learner.
The Development of Stereotypes
The use of stereotypes in learner modeling began with GRUNDY (Rich, 
1979), which allows the learner to give himself a personal description. 
This description is used by the system to trigger a predefined trigger in the 
system. Depending on the trigger triggered, the system adapts to the needs 
of the learner.
Assuming an S-stereotype that aims to collect learner information to 
initialize part of a learner’s model in an adaptive system, and learner responses 
to explicit system questions as components {cj} of the system, each of these 
components represent aspects of the learner during his or her time in the 
system.
1. Activation of Stereotypes
The activation of each stereotype is related to a set of triggers {tSi}, where 
each trigger {tSi} is a Boolean expression based on a component {cj} or a 
function of a set of components f({ck}) model of the learner.
The first action of a stereotype is related to the validity of the learner’s 
response to an explicit question posed by the system. Thus:

Meaning that when a trigger {tSi} has become true, stereotype S will be 
activated.
2. The Retraction of Stereotypes
There is also in the stereotype method a series of retractions {rSi} which is 
considered the basis on which an S stereotype is deactivated.
A stereotype S is deactivated if a retraction condition {rSi} has become true:

INITIAL TESTING WITH BAYESIAN NETWORKS
For a complete collection of learner information, we will use the initial test 
method, which will allow us to initialize the learner model in a complete 
way taking into account all aspects and components of this model. By asking 
the learner to pass tests, the initial parameters of the learner model can be 
obtained through the analysis of the results of these tests.
The problem encountered in using this method is the control of the length 
of the tests proposed to the learner. Length or redundancy in these tests may 
cause the learner to leave the system. To solve this problem we propose in 
this work to use the Bayesian networks as a method to construct these initial 
tests. On the one hand, we can benefit from the power of this method for 
managing the probabilistic aspect of the learner’s information which will 
guide us towards the construction of a well-structured set of tests and, on the 
other hand, to realize a comprehensive analysis of the domain information 
of the learner model based on the results of each test and on the real-time 
monitoring of the learner during each proposed test.

The specification of the structure of the model, in which we define 
the nodes and the orientation of the arcs for all the components of our 
network.
•	
The specification of the values of variables, in which we will calculate 
the value tables of the variables of each node of our network.
The Structure Specification of the Model
To illustrate the stages of development of Bayesian networks to model the 
initial tests for the collection of data on the learner, we will begin by defining 
the nodes of our network. Our network consists of an initial “Initial Test” 
node, which is composed of several parent nodes representing the modules 
taught in the Specialized Master “Pedagogical Engineering Multimedia” 
(Ingénierie Pédagogique Multimédia) at Abdelmalek Essaâdi University; in 
our work, we chose three modules with different criteria to test the validity 
of our hypothesis (Project Management, Digital Image Processing, Human 
Machine Interaction). Each of these nodes is also composed of the parent 
nodes, the links of these nodes are preliminary relations:

131
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
•	
Initial Tests: This node allows the collection of all the data from the 
tests of each module the learner chosen to take.
•	
Project Management: The learner, and before following the training 
of this module, he is led to take an initial test to measure his level 
of knowledge and competence, the latter consists of two types of 
evaluation
◦◦
Knowledge: The learner must answer on more than 10 questions to 
measure how much of his knowledge. This part of the assessment 
reflects the evaluation of the learner’s knowledge.
◦◦
Ability: This is a written proof that responds if the learner 
can apply the knowledge acquired in the module. This type of 
evaluation reflects the part of the learner’s know-how.
•	
Digital Image Processing: The learner, and before following the 
training of this module, he is led to take an initial test to measure 
his level of knowledge and skill, the latter consists of two types of 
evaluation:
◦◦
Knowledge: The learner must answer on more than 10 questions to 
measure how much of his knowledge. This part of the assessment 
reflects the evaluation of the learner’s knowledge.
◦◦
Ability: This is a written proof that responds if the learner 
can apply the knowledge acquired in the module. This type of 
evaluation reflects the part of the learner’s know-how.
•	
Human Machine Interaction: The learner, and before following 
the training of this module, he is led to take an initial test to measure 
his level of knowledge and skill, the latter consists of two types of 
evaluation:
◦◦
Knowledge: The learner must answer on more than 10 questions to 
measure how much of his knowledge. This part of the assessment 
reflects the evaluation of the learner’s knowledge.
◦◦
Ability: This is a written proof that responds if the learner 
can apply the knowledge acquired in the module. This type of 
evaluation reflects the part of the learner’s know-how.
The value that measures the relative importance of each condition varies 
from 0 to 1, the values of each evaluation element is defined by the teacher.
In other words, it is the weight of the arc from the parent node to the child 
node. All weights regarding the child variable will build its CPT. the sum 
of the weights of all arcs at / from each child / parent node in case of hidden 
variables / proofs should be 1. This means that each weight is standardized.

132
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
The relationship between the target variable (T) and the variable of the 
proof (E) must be from T to E because the process that calculates the posterior 
probability of the target variable is evidence of diagnostic knowledge. So, 
if variable of evidence has no child and its parents must be target variables. 
There are two types of relationships:
•	
Prerequisite relationships between the target variables.
•	
Diagnostic relationships of the target variables to the proof. The 
mastery of concepts (targets) effects on the confidence of evidence. 
However, if the learner has failed an exam, he is not sure of his lack 
of knowledge or ability because he can make an unexpected mistake.
The Specification of the Values of the Variables
Once the network structure is presented, it is easy to define the values of 
the variables. Figure 3 shows the Bayesian network of initial tests for the 
initialization of the learner model in an educational hypermedia system.
In the developed Bayesian network we observe that the initial test of 
node (I) consists of three parents: Digital Image Processing (T), Project 
Management (G) and Human Machine Interaction (M) corresponding to 
three reports of preliminary weights: w1 = 0.1, w2 = 0.5, w3 = 0.4. The 
conditional probability of (I) is calculated as follows:

RESULTS
After developing our Bayesian network combining the superposition model, we 
will try to validate and justify our approach by testing it in a real context. To 
do this, we chose the first year class of IPM (Master’s Degree in Engineering 
Pedagogy Multimedia)
Before presenting our experimentation results, using the developed 
Bayesian network. We will begin by presenting the framework in which we 
will evaluate our approach and then present the parameters on which we will 
base the evaluation. Next, we will present the combined Bayesian network 
and its performance evaluation.
Evaluation Metrics
In this section, and before presenting the results of our tests, we will present 
the metric by which we measure the performance of the Learner module 
Table 5. The conditional probability table of the node “Man Machine Interaction”

137
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
modeled using Bayesian networks. The UnBBayes (Costa et al., 2008) 
software allows us to evaluate dynamically and in real time the performance 
of each node in our network. Here are the parameters we used to evaluate 
our Bayesian network:
Here are the metrics we used to evaluate our Bayesian network:
•	
The Global Confusion Matrix (GCM) calculated for the selected 
target node and all selected proof nodes.
•	
Probability of Correct Classification (PCC): the probability of a 
correct classification, it is calculated from the global confusion matrix 
taking into account all the control nodes of the Bayesian network.
•	
Marginal CPC (MPCC): the probability of a correct classification, it 
is calculated from the global confusion matrix, taking into account all 
the control nodes in the Bayesian network other than that presented in 
the row.
•	
Marginal Improvement (MI): the probability of a correct classification, 
it is calculated from the global confusion matrix, taking into account 
all the nodes of evidence in the Bayesian network and obtained by 
adding the node presented in the row to remains of other nodes.
•	
Individual PCC (IPCC): the probability of a correct classification 
calculated from the LCM by considering only the evidence presented 
in the row.
•	
Cost Rate: the individual probability of a correct classification on the 
cost ratio.
The Combined Bayesian Network
Before presenting the evaluation results of each node of our Bayesian network 
representing the initial tests to initialize the learner model in an adaptive 
system, we will begin by presenting the combined Bayesian network through 
the UnBBayes software.
Figure 4 gives us a diagram of the combined network, with the marginal 
variables of each node of our network developing; we can observe the change 
in the marginal variables of each node of our network, simply by changing one 
or more marginal variables of one or more parent nodes of the selected node.
In Figure 4, we present the Bayesian network obtained after the change 
of the marginal variables in the two parent nodes “Knowledge” and “Skills” 
of the node “Project management”.

138
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
The marginal variables of these two nodes are changed from the initial 
percentage to 100%, which means that the learner to pass both evaluations 
successfully. We note that the marginal variables of the nodes “Project 
management” and “Initial test” will also change. For the “Project management” 
node, the marginal success variable is high up to 100%, and for the “Initial 
test” node, the marginal success variable is raised to 68%.
All this means that the success of each learner in the initial set of tests is 
primarily related to his / her success in the tests of each module.

Evaluation of Node Performance
In order to evaluate the performance of our developed Bayesian networks, 
we will first evaluate the performance of each node in our network, using 
the UnBBayes software and the evaluation metrics presented in the previous 
section.
Evaluation of the Node “Digital Image Processing”
For the “Digital image processing” node, there are two parent nodes: 
“Knowledge” and “Abilities”, choosing the “Digital image processing” node 
as a target node and the parents as nodes of results shown in Figure 5.
According to the results of the results table, we find that:
By adding nodes of evidence in our evaluation of the target node, the 
probability percentage of correct classifications increases. And by measuring 
the probability of a correct classification of each node, we see how each node 
contributes independently to the classification. In this evaluation, we find 
that the node “Abilities” is the node that contributes the most.
We find how each node contributes according to the set of nodes in front 
of them. In this evaluation, the marginal improvement of the node “Abilities” 
means that the influence of this node is greater with respect to the target node. 
We also note that, although the cost is the same, the marginal cost of the two 
different sensors, the sensor, which in most cases represents the marginal 
cost of the variables of the “Abilities” node.
Figure 5. Evaluation of the node “Digital image processing”

140
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
All this reflect that the success of a learner in this module of Digital Image 
Processing is based more on his success in the test that relates to these abilities, 
more than the test that relates to his knowledge. The system can therefore, on 
the basis of its results to define the level of knowledge of the learner (based 
on the result of the knowledge test), his level of skill (based on the result of 
the ability test), and also to deduce the learning style and preferences of the 
learner in this learning situation, in order to adapt according to the profile 
of each learner, we shift affect the appropriate module.
Evaluation of the Node “Project Management”
For the “Project Management” node, there are two parent nodes: “Knowledge” 
and “Abilities”, choosing the “Project Management” node as a target node 
and the parents as nodes of evidence, in Figure 6.
According to the results of the results table, we find that:
By adding nodes of evidence in our evaluation of the target node, the 
probability percentage of correct classifications increases. And by measuring 
the probability of a correct classification of each node, we see how each node 
contributes independently to the classification. In this evaluation, we find 
that the node “Knowledge” is the node that contributes the most.
We find how each node contributes according to the set of nodes in front 
of them. In this evaluation, the marginal improvement of the “Knowledge” 
node means that the influence of this node is greater than the target node. 
We also note that, although the cost is the same, the marginal cost of the two

141
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
different sensors, the sensor, which in most cases represents the marginal 
cost of the variables of the Knowledge node.
All this reflect that the success of a learner in this module of Project 
Management is based more on his success in the test that concerns this 
knowledge, more what the test relates to his abilities. The system can therefore, 
on the basis of its results to define the level of knowledge of the learner (based 
on the result of the knowledge test), his level of skill (based on the result of 
the ability test), and also to deduce the learning style and preferences of the 
learner in this learning situation, in order to adapt according to the profile 
of each learner, we shift affect the appropriate module.
Evaluation of the Node “Interaction Man Machine”
For the Human machine interaction node, there are two parent nodes: 
“Knowledge” and “Abilities”, selecting the «Human machine interaction» 
node as a target node and the parents as nodes of evidences, in Figure 7.
According to the results of the results table, we find that:
By adding nodes of evidence in our evaluation of the target node, the 
probability percentage of correct classifications increases. And by measuring 
the probability of a correct classification of each node, we see how each node 
contributes independently to the classification. In this evaluation, we find 
that the node “Abilities” is the node that contributes the most.
We find how each node contributes according to the set of nodes in front 
of them. In this evaluation, the marginal improvement of the “Abilities” node 
means that the influence of this node is greater than the target node. We also

note that, although the cost is the same, the marginal cost of the two different 
sensors, the sensor, which in most cases represents the marginal cost of the 
variables of the Abilities node.
All this reflect that the success of a learner in this module Human machine 
interaction is based more on his success in the test that concerns this knowledge, 
more than the test that relates to his abilities. The system can therefore, on 
the basis of its results to define the level of knowledge of the learner (based 
on the result of the knowledge test), his level of skill (based on the result of 
the ability test), and also to deduce the learning style and preferences of the 
learner in this learning situation, in order to adapt according to the profile 
of each learner, we shift affect the appropriate module.
Evaluation of the Full Bayesian Network
After the validation of each node of the Bayesian network of our model 
of the learner. This section presents the validation results of the complete 
Bayesian network.
Figure 8 presents the validation results of the Bayesian network in a 
complete way. In this evaluation of the network, we will only ask the learner 
to successfully pass the two initial tests of the two modules “Human Machine 
Interaction” and “Project Management”. The marginal variable of the initial 
node “Initial test” will in this case have a value of 61.47%. Changing one 
of these two nodes will affect the marginal variables of our network in a 
probabilistic way.
Figure 8. the evaluation results of the “initial test” node of the developed Bayesian 
network

143
The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
Based on the results and the validation of each node of the Bayesian 
network, we were able to manage the network in a global way.
When the learner enters the system and before assigning the module to 
his / her needs and according to his / her level of knowledge and skills, the 
learner will be required to take a set of initial tests concerning all the modules 
available in adaptive educational hypermedia system. Each of these modules 
consists of two types of evaluation; an assessment based on the learner’s 
knowledge, and an assessment based on these abilities.
The results from these two types of tests will enable us to define the 
level of knowledge, the level of competences, the learning styles and other 
information about each learner in our system; for example, if a learner passes 
the initial test of the “Digital image processing”, we will demonstrate his 
level of knowledge of the learner in this module based on the results of the 
“Knowledge” type tests and his skill level in this module based on the results 
of the “Skills” tests, and we can therefore deduce from the results of both 
types of tests the appropriate learning style of this learner in this module.
DISCUSSION
The approach presented in this chapter combines the method of stereotypes 
for the collection of contents of the specific information domain, based on 
the explicit questions posed to the learner after entering the system, using the 
Bayesian network method for the collection of contents of the independent 
information domain, based on the initial tests the learner is led to take before 
assignment in a specific learning situation.
Table 6 shows different contents of the learner model with their description 
and explanation, grouping each component according to the appropriate 
information model, and the methods used for the initialization of the set of 
these contents.
The results of tests and validation presented in the previous sections show 
that this combination for the collection of data on the learner in an adaptive 
educational hypermedia system will allow us to initiate the learner model in 
a clearer way and complete.

The Combination of Bayesian Networks and Stereotypes
As we have shown in the table above, some content of the learner model 
such as the learning styles, and learner skills, even if they can be represented 
using Bayesian networks, we will propose use a combination of Bayesian 
networks with other modeling methods of the learner model, and precisely the 
superposition model that addresses the problem of the dynamic management 
of the learner model by representing the learner’s knowledge as a subset of 
knowledge of the system.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We have shown how, from a theoretical point of view and by applying our 
hypothesis on a concrete case, that the combination of the stereotype method 
and the Bayesian networks is an appropriate approach for the initialization 
of the learner model in the adaptive educational hypermedia systems.
The experiments presented in this article are all arguments in favor of 
our hypothesis on the probabilistic initialization of the learner model, using 
all the nodes as sensors to measure and evaluate the modulus of the learner.
This approach may encounter difficulties in the case of a large number of 
data stored in the system, for which we have proposed in previous works the 
use of multi Bayesian networks to try to cover all the data even if the number 
of data stored is pupil (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2014)
We see mainly two directions in which to continue this work. On the one 
hand, they integrate this method in the step of updating the learner model in 
an adaptive educational hypermedia system and on the other hand transform 
the Bayesian networks developed for the management of the learner model to a 
machine-readable language, such as ontologies, or as we previously proposed, 
using probabilistic ontologies as a formalism that gives us the possibility of 
combining Bayesian networks with ontologies. (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2015

ABSTRACT
This chapter presents a probabilistic and dynamic learner model based on 
multi-entity Bayesian networks and artificial intelligence. There are several 
methods for modelling the learner in AHES, but they’re based on the initial 
profile of the learner created in his entry into the learning situation. They do 
not handle the uncertainty in the dynamic modelling of the learner based on 
the actions of the learner. The main purpose of this chapter is the management 
of the learner model based on MEBN and artificial intelligence, taking into 
account the different actions that the learner could take during his/her whole 
learning path. The approach that the authors followed in this chapter is marked 
initially by modelling the learner model in three levels: they started with the 
conceptual level of modelling with the unified modelling language, followed 
by the model based on Bayesian networks to be able to achieve probabilistic 
modelling in the three phases of learner modelling.

A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
INTRODUCTION
We have shown in previous works (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2017), that the 
learner model in adaptive hypermedia is characterized by its complexity, 
large data size, dynamic evolution, and relativities. We have also presented a 
very precise approach to its management by using a combination of methods, 
models and techniques to try to treat dynamically and probabilistically its 
evolution (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2016)
We will focus in this chapter on modeling the learner model in a dynamic 
and probabilistic way, we will propose in this work the use of the notion of 
fragments and M-theory to lead to a Multi-Entity Bayesian networks. The 
use of this Bayesian method can handle the whole course of a learner as well 
as all of its shares in an adaptive educational hypermedia.
The main hypothesis of this chapter is the management of the learner model 
based on multi-entity Bayesian networks. To achieve this goal, one must first 
ask the following questions: Why and how can one model the learner model 
with a probabilistic method? What is the approach to go from a conceptual 
modeling of this model to dynamic modeling? Is this taking into account 
experimentally justified?
First, we will return to the learner model that we first modeled using the 
Unified Modeling Language Use Case Diagram, and then we will present 
the Bayesian network of the learner model that we have developed. Then, we 
will explain the approach followed in this chapter for modeling the learner 
model with multi-entity Bayesian networks, beginning with the presentation of 
MEBNs and their composition, then explaining the notions of fragments and 
theories. Finally, and in order to dismantle the validity of our hypothesis, we 
will present the fragments of each node of our network, its random variables, 
and then present our multi-entity Bayesian network in a complete way.
LEARNER MODELING IN ADAPTIVE HYPERMEDIA
In this section, we will come back to the steps to follow when modeling the 
learner in an adaptive education system using UML, from the user’s Meta 
model and in the use case diagram. Gathering all the learner’s actions in the 
adaptive system.

151
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
The Learner Meta-Model
In this section, we will present a user-specific meta-model for e-Learning 
presented by Aammou (2013). This model includes a combination of models 
for e-Learning and adaptive hypermarkets. It takes into account elements 
such as the history of actions, which are missing in the formal models. 
The construction of this model allowed us to understand the user’s creative 
process model for adaptive hypermedia, helping us build our hyperonym 
model (Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2015)
In our e-Learning user model, we want to be able to:
•	
Define characteristic attributes, essential and common to all users: 
name, username, password and age;
•	
Define the categories of attributes to separate the user’s preferences, 
academic / professional characteristics and others. This distinction will 
make it easier to import data, maintain the system, and communicate 
with external systems; the attributes are differentiated according to 
their nature.
•	
Retain the documents covered by the user in two ways: first, by 
involving them in a complete course. On the other hand, specifically 
related to the notion they investigated. The purpose of this historical 
duplicate is to present the same documents to the user when he wishes 
to return to a concept already brought to his attention during his first 
learning of this concept.
The UML class diagram representation of our user model is given in 
Figure 1.
•	
The User Manager class is responsible for interfacing with the other 
components of adaptive hypermedia system. For this purpose, it is 
provided by the Ask and Tell methods to ask questions and provide 
answers to the external components (domain model, adaptation model). 
It is connected to all the users; and responsible for managing, by an 
aggregation relationship.
•	
The User class is responsible for representing information about a 
particular user. It is composed of predefined attributes: name, username, 
password and age.

152
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
•	
Attribute Preference class is responsible for representing the 
preferences of the user. These are view preferences: font size, color 
problems, contrast, etc., and his presentation preferences. He may 
prefer textual or graphic elements. And he may not want audio element, 
for example.
•	
The Attribute Background class is responsible for representing the 
user attributes related to their academic / professional background.
•	
The Stereotype class is responsible for representing the various 
categories of stereotypes to which the user belongs. By definition, a 
stereotype is an image or a fixed design and schematic of an aspect 
of reality. In our model, a stereotype consists of a name and a value. 
The name sets the stereotype (eg “learning rate”) and the value is used 
to characterize the user (eg quick for the stereotype “learning rate”). 
The number of possible values is often reduced to a given stereotype. 
Values are often based on other attributes. Stereotypes are different 
from other attributes by their schematic characterization of the user, 
where they can represent much more granularity elements.
Figure 1. The class diagram of the user Meta-model

153
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
•	
Other attribute class is responsible for representing the user attributes 
not related to his career and which are not preferences, for example, a 
data encryption key. The purpose of this class is to ensure compatibility 
of the model with standard models like IMS or PAPI Learner, because 
some attributes do not fit into other categories of attributes defined 
above.
•	
Degree is an association class which is responsible for giving a value 
to the knowledge of a concept by the user. The possible values are: very 
low, low, average, good, excellent. This scale is a range of values that 
allows having a good precision with respect to a binary classification, 
and avoids a degree of accuracy too high and therefore it’s very useful 
for adaptation.
•	
Historical class is in charge of representing a historical document 
covered in the learner path, allowing to give the date of the course of 
a document, browsing history in order in a historical path (it contains 
two methods NextDocument() and PreviousDocument()). The historic 
class can be used to represent all the documents covered by a user’s 
history, or to represent the historical documents covered to reach a 
certain degree of knowledge for a given concept.
Both class Document and class Concept are detailed in the model domain
The Learner Model’s Use Case Diagram
Based on the meta-model, we were able to map out the functionality of the 
learner using the use case diagram Figure 2 to reflect a part of the student’s 
actions in an adaptive system. We will explain in this part each of these actions 
beholding the relationships of these actions with each other and within the 
system operation process.
Based upon the meta-model presented in the previous section, we have 
illustrated in the following table (Table 1).
Table 1. The main actions of a learner in a learning situation in an adaptive system
Learner’s actions
     • Follow courses 
     • Take pretest 
     • Take evaluation

A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
In Figure 2 a main actor is identified, named “the learner”. The figure 
shows the generalization relationships between use cases and the learner, and 
the generalization relationships: inclusion and extension between use cases.
In particular, the functional requirement “learner” represents all information 
about the learner in the hypermedia system (his knowledge, his skills, personal 
information ...). This functional requirement is shown with a generalization 
relationship with three functional requirements:
•	
“Pretest” which represents the information about the pretest that the 
learner has to take before entering the learning situation. The pretest is 
composed of two types of evaluation components: tests of knowledge 
depicted with the functional requirement “knowledge” and a functional 
Figure 2. Use case diagram UML representing the learner actions

155
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
requirement “skills” which represents the test through which we will 
evaluate the learner’s skills.
•	
“Learning activity”: this functional requirement represents the 
information about the learning activities, each learning activity in 
adaptive educational hypermedia system is of two types, static activities 
represented by the functional requirement “Static” and interactive 
activities represented by the functional requirement “Interactive”
•	
“Evaluation”, which represents the information about the evaluation 
tests that the learner has to take after the completion of each learning 
activity. In case of failure of the learner in the evaluation, the learner 
must pass to remediation; which is represented through a functional 
requirement “remediation” which is connected with the functional 
requirement “evaluation” through an extension of relationship.
In case of remediation, the functional requirement “remediation” involves 
the activation of the functional requirement “call tutor” through inclusion 
relation. This requirement represents the activation of the tutor to help the 
student to return to its shortcomings in the learning activity.
Another inclusion relation is represented in our figure which represents 
the actions of the learner in an adaptive system, appearing in the relationship 
between the functional requirement “call tutor” and requirements “reading the 
history of the learner” that activates the return of the system to the profile and 
the course information of the learner. And a requirement “system awareness”, 
that enables the system to follow the course of the learner after remediation.
The Bayesian Network Developed From the Learner Model
The development of Bayesian network based on the use case diagram for 
modeling the learner in an adaptive educational system passes through two 
essential steps:
1. Specification of the Model Structure
Taking the case of the node “Learner” to illustrate the stages of development 
of our Bayesian network representing the model of the learner, notes that 
this node has three parent nodes (Pretest, Learning Activity and Evaluation), 
and each of these nodes is composed of child nodes. Links to these nodes 
are prerequisites relationships:

156
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
•	
Learning activity: In this node, all students following the course must 
go through activities, which are in the adaptive system of two types: 
static and interactive.
•	
Pretest: All learners, before taking the learning activities of each 
course must take a pre-test, it consists of two types of evaluation:
◦◦
Knowledge: the student must answer more than 10 questions to 
measure how his wealth of knowledge. This type of evaluation 
reflects the evaluation part of the knowledge of the learner.
◦◦
Skills: This is a written proof if the student can apply the knowledge 
gained in the module. This type of evaluation reflects the part of 
skills of the learner.
•	
Evaluation: After the student follows the learning activity, it is carried 
to conduct an evaluation to determine their level of knowledge and 
skill within the module. The evaluation is essential to guide the course 
of the learner.
The value that measures the relative importance of each condition varies 
from 0 to 1, the values of each evaluation element is defined by the teacher. 
In this case the teacher of the module “Database”.
The relationship between the target variable (T) and the evidence variable 
(E) is from T to E because the process that calculates the posterior probability 
of target variable is the proof of knowledge of the diagnosis. So if variable 
evidence has no children, his parents must be the target variables. There are 
two types of relationships:
•	
Prerequisites Relations between target variables.
•	
Diagnostic Relations of target variables to evidence variables. The 
control of concepts (targets) affects on confidence of evidence. 
However, if the learner has failed a test, it is not sure of his lack of 
knowledge or ability because it can make an unexpected error.
2. The Specification of Variable Values
Once the use case diagrams were created, it is easy to create the structure 
of the Bayesian network using the rules described in the previous sections. 
Figure 3 represents the Bayesian network built from the use case diagram 
shown in the previous section. Notice how the conditional independence was 
directly modeled by applying the rules as shown.

157
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
In the Bayesian network developed, we observe that the node Learner (L) 
has three parents: Learning Activity (A), Evaluation (E) and Pretest (T) which 
in turn are corresponding to three weights of prerequisite relationship: w1=0.1, 
w2=0.5, w3=0.4. Conditional probability of (L) is computed as follows:

modeling, and on which we based our research for the management of the 
model of learning in adaptive hypermedia. We will first begin by presenting 
the first-order logic, which is considered the basis of Bayesian networks, 
and then we will present Multi-Entity Bayesian networks, their principles 
and their logic.
First-Order Logic
First-order logic is by far the logical system most commonly used, studied 
and implemented. First-order logic is a formal system used to define theories 
in mathematics, computer science, and other scientific fields. It is a very 
important concept from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. 
First-order logic can also be used as a rigorous foundation for knowledge 
representation systems (Laskey, 2008)
A theory in first-order logic consists of axioms, expressed in sentences in 
the first-order language, in conjunction with sentences derived from axioms 
according to the rules of reasoning, that is, valid theorems or sentences. In 
practice, when a first order theory is implemented in a computer, the axioms 
are stored as data structures and the reasoning that evaluates the truth value 
of a sentence to the form of a computer program.
Theories are expressed using the first-order logical language. The main 
components of the first-order logical language are constants, variables, 
functions, and predicates. Variables are placeholders for constants. The 
functions return a relative constant of their input arguments. Predicates are 
an essential component of first-order logic (the reason why it is also called 
predicate logic), since they are used to define relationships between other 
components, such as variables and constants. For example, the preaching 
parents (John, Mary, George), can say that John and Mary are relatives of 
George. What also makes the first-order logic a strongly expressive language 
are the rules, such as “brothers (X, Y): - parents (X, X1, X2) AND (Y, X1, 
X2)”. This rule states that two persons X, Y are siblings if they have the 
same parents.
An interpretation of a first-order logical theory gives a semantic meaning to 
each constant, predicate, and function (formulas). Specifically, an interpretation 
maps each formula to a specific nominal entity, to the constraints of each 
predicate to relate with other entities belonging to a specific set, and links a 
function to a domain function. A set containing all the instantiated formulas 
of a first-order logical theory is called an interpretation.

161
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
However, first-order logic does not provide expressivity for modeling 
uncertain knowledge, let alone a rigorous reasoning mechanism. This is a 
consequence of the fact that each interpretation mentioned above shares an 
equal validity with the others. As we will see in the following sections, the 
key feature of MEBN is the assignment of a probability to each interpretation. 
This is achieved with Bayesian first order logic (FOBL) (Laskey et al., 2000)
Presentation of Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
Multi-Entity Bayesian networks are logical systems that integrate first-order 
logic (FOL) with Bayesian probability theory. Multi-Entity Bayesian networks 
extend ordinary Bayesian networks to allow representation of graphical models 
with repeated substructures. Knowledge is coded as a collection of Bayesian 
network fragments (called MFrags) that can be instantiated and combined to 
form Bayesian networks specific to the complex situation. A theory of multi-
entity Bayesian networks (M-Theory) implicitly represents a joint probability 
distribution on possibly unlimited numbers of hypotheses and uses Bayesian 
learning to refine a knowledge base as observations accumulate. The multi-
entity Bayesian network provides a logical basis for the emergent collection 
of highly expressive, probability-based languages. (Costa et al., 2005)
Multi-Entity Bayesian networks (MEBNs) are the result of combining 
Bayesian networks with first-order logic (FOL). In other words, in a MEBN, 
Bayesian network capability to model uncertainty is combined with first-order 
logic expressivity. From the point of view of stochastic Bayesian modeling, 
the goal of using MEBN is to build a Bayesian Situation-Specific Network 
(SSBN) that is customized based on the snapshot of the environment in that 
situation. In multi-entity Bayesian networks, the Bayesian network is extended 
to a first-order logical Bayesian network (FOBN), which is used to express and 
represent knowledge. This overcomes the gap in Bayesian networks by being 
very rigid and inflexible for modeling dynamic environments. (Costa, 2005)
Multi-Entity Bayesian networks integrate first-order logic with Bayesian 
probability. The logic of Multi-Entity Bayesian networks expresses probabilistic 
knowledge as a collection of fragments of Multi-Entity Bayesian networks 
(MFrags) organized into Multi-Entity Bayesian networks (MTheories). An 
MFrag represents a conditional probability distribution of the instances of 
its resident random variables taking into account the values of their parent 
instances in the fragment graphics and given context constraints (Laskey, 2008)

162
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
A collection of MFrags represents a joint probability distribution over an 
unlimited number, possibly infinite, of its random variables. Joint distribution is 
specified using local distributions with conditional independence relationships 
implied by fragmented graphics. Contextual terms are used to specify the 
constraints under which local distributions apply.
A collection of MFrags that satisfies consistency constraints ensuring the 
existence of a single joint probability distribution on its random variables 
is called MTheories. MTheories can express probability distributions on 
the truth values of arbitrary first-order logic sequences and can be used to 
express domain-specific ontologies that capture statistical regularities in a 
particular application domain.
In addition, MTheories may represent particular facts relevant to a given 
reasoning problem. The conditioning of a prior distribution represented by 
an MTheorie on its results is the basis of the probabilistic inference with the 
logic of multi-entity Bayesian networks (Carvalho, 2011)
Fragments of Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
The logic of Multi-Entity Bayesian networks represents the world composed of 
entities with attributes and related to other entities. Random variables represent 
features of entities and relationships between entities. The knowledge of 
attributes and relationships is expressed as a collection of fragments organized 
in M-Theory. A fragment represents a conditional probability distribution for 
the cases of its resident RVs given their parents in the fragment graph and 
the context nodes (Carvalho, 2011)
Like a Bayesian network, an MFrag contains nodes, which represent 
random variables, arranged in a directed graph whose edges represent direct 
dependency relationships. An isolated MFrag can be compared to a standard 
Bayesian network with known values for its root nodes and known local 
distributions for its child nodes.
For example, the MFrag shown in Figure 4 was taken from a model of 
a Multi-Entity Bayesian networks on the Star Trek domain and represents 
knowledge of the degree of danger to which the spacecraft is exposed. The 
fragment graph has seven nodes. The four nodes at the top of the figure are 
contextual nodes; the two rectangular nodes shaded under the contextual 
nodes are the input nodes; and the lower node is a resident node.
A node in an MFrag can have a parentheses list of arguments. These 
arguments are placeholders for domain entities. For example, the st argument 

163
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
of the HarmPotential node (st, t) is a placeholder for an entity that may be 
harmful, while the t argument is a placeholder for the time step that this 
instance represents. To refer to an actual entity in the domain, the argument 
is replaced by a unique identifier. By convention, unique identifiers begin 
with an exclamation point and no separate entity can have the same unique 
identifier. The result of the substitution of unique identifiers for the arguments 
of a random variable is one or more instances of this variable. For example, 
HarmPotential (! ST1,! T1) and HarmPotential (! ST2,! T1) are two instances 
of HarmPotential (st, t) that both occur in the time step!T1.
The resident nodes of an MFrag have local distributions that define how 
their probabilities depend on their parent’s values in the fragment graph. 
In a complete M-Theory, each random variable has exactly one domestic 
MFrag, where its local distribution is defined. The input and context nodes 
(for example, OpSpec (st) or IsOwnStarship (s)) influence the distribution of 
resident nodes, but their distributions are defined in their own home MFrags 
(Carvalho et al., 2010)
Contextual nodes represent conditions that must be satisfied for local 
influences and distributions of the fragment graph to be applied. Contextual 
nodes can have a true, false, or absurd value. Context nodes with a true value 
are considered satisfied. For example, if the unique identifier for Enterprise 
(! ST0) is replaced by the variable s in IsOwnStarship (s), the resulting 
assumption will be true. If, instead, a unique star identifier (ST1) is used, 
then this assumption will be false. Finally, if the unique identifier of a Non-
spacecraft (! Z1) replaces s, this statement is absurd (ie it is absurd to wonder 
if an area in space is its own ship spatial).

al., 2010)

A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
To avoid cluttering the graph of fragments, the states of the context nodes 
are not represented, unlike what happens with the input and resident nodes. 
This is mainly because they are Boolean nodes whose values are relevant 
only to decide whether to use the local distribution of a residential random 
variable or its default distribution. (Wright et al., 2002) (Costa et al., 2009)
MANAGING THE LEARNER MODEL WITH 
MULTI-ENTITY BAYESIAN NETWORKS
In this part of the chapter, we will first present the fragments that we have 
developed from the Bayesian Learner Model Network. Then, we will present 
the complete Multi-Entity Bayesian networks of the learner model based on 
first-order logic.
Fragments of the Learner Model
In the previous sections of this chapter, we presented the Bayesian network 
of the learner model that we developed from a use case diagram. To arrive at 
a multi-entity Bayesian network of the learner model, it is essential to start 
by first developing the fragments of this network based on the predominant 
nodes of this network.
The main nodes of our Bayesian network, which will be transformed into 
fragments of the Multi-Entity Bayesian networks of the learner model, are:
•	
The pre-test fragment
•	
The learning situation fragment
•	
The evaluation fragment
In order to develop the Multi-Entity Bayesian networks of the learner 
model, it is first necessary to define the context nodes, the input nodes, and 
the distribution within each resident node of these fragments.
1. Fragment of the Node Pre-Test
For the pre-test node fragment that represents information about the pre-test 
that the learner must first pass before entering a learning situation. This 
fragment is composed as we have already shown in the previous sections of 

165
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
two types of Pre-tests, the first concerns the knowledge of the learner, and 
the second is a pre-test concerning the skills of the learner.
The green flowcharts in our fragment represent the random variables of 
the context that express the validation conditions of our fragment within 
the multi-entity Bayesian network. The rounded rectangles in our fragment 
represent the input random variables, the distribution of its variables will be 
used in other fragments of the multi-entity Bayesian network.
Figure 5 shows the fragment of the Pre-test node of our multi-entity 
Bayesian network. There are two random variables in our fragment, is 
(Knowledge, Abilities) which concerns the determination of the type of 
Pre-test that the learner must take represented by the input random variable 
Type Pre-test (obj). And the variable isP (Passed, Failed) which concerns 
the validation of the Pre-test by the learner represented by the input random 
variable ValidationPre-test (obj).
2. Fragment of the Node Learning Activity
For the node learning activity fragment, that represents information about 
the learning activity that the learner must follow during his or her learning 
path. This fragment is composed as we have already shown in the preceding 
sections of two types of activities. The first type of activity is interactive, 
and the second type is static.
The green flowcharts in our fragment represent the random variables of 
the context that express the validation conditions of our fragment within 
the multi-entity Bayesian network. The rounded rectangles in our fragment 
represent the input random variables, the distribution of its variables will be 
used in other fragments of the multi-entity Bayesian network.
Figure 5. The fragment of the node pre-test of the MEBN

166
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
Figure 6 shows the fragment of the learning activity node of our multi-
entity Bayesian network. There are two random variables in our fragment, is 
(Interactive, Static) which relates to the determination of the type of learning 
activity that the learner must follow represented by the input random variable 
Type Learning Activity (obj). And the variable isAP (Passed, Failed) which 
concerns the validation of the learning activity by the learner represented by 
the input random variable Validation Learning Activity (obj).
3. Fragment of the Node Evaluation
For the node evaluation fragment, that represents the assessment information 
that the learner must take at the end of each learning activity during their 
learning journey. This fragment is composed as we have already shown in 
the chapters of a primordial relation concerning the call of a tutor to help the 
learner in case of remediation.
The green flowcharts in our fragment represent the random variables of 
the context that express the validation conditions of our fragment within 
the multi-entity Bayesian network. The rounded rectangles in our fragment 
represent the input random variables, the distribution of its variables will be 
used in other fragments of the multi-entity Bayesian network.
Figure 7 shows the fragment of the node Evaluation of our multi-entity 
Bayesian network. There are two random variables in our tutor call(History, 
System Awareness) fragment that pertains to a tutor’s call to help the learner 
based on his or her browsing history and to sensitize the system to the 
remediation case that is represented by the random input variable Remediation 
Figure 6. The fragment of the node Learning Activity of the MEBN

167
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
(Tutor call). And the variable isE (Passed, Failed) which concerns the 
validation of the evaluation by the learner represented by the input random 
variable Validation Evaluation (obj).
The Random input variable Remediation (Tutor call) is related to the 
conditioning of the input random variable Validation Evaluation (obj), which 
means that remediation is enabled only in the case of failure of the evaluation, 
this condition requires the tutor’s call to help the learner in difficulty.
The Multi-Entity Bayesian Network of the Learner Model
After the development of the three main fragments of our Bayesian network, 
we will present in this part the complete multi-entity Bayesian network of 
our learner model. As we defined in the previous sections of this chapter, 
the knowledge of attributes and relationships is expressed as a collection of 
fragments organized in M-Theory.
We will begin with a presentation of the learner fragment of our learner 
model, which concerns the main node of our learner model, its random 
variables, its output variables, and the probabilistic relationships between 
the father node and its children. Then we will treat the multi-entity Bayesian 
network of the learner model that represents all the fragments of the model 
and the relationships between them.
Figure 7. The fragment of node the Learning Activity of the MEBN

168
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
1. Learner’s Node Fragment
For the learning node, there are three child nodes of this main node: the 
Pre-test, the learning activity, and the evaluation, which in turn represents a 
conditional child node called remediation.
The green flowcharts in our fragment represent the random variables of 
the context that express the validation conditions of our fragment within 
the multi-entity Bayesian network. The rounded rectangles in our fragment 
represent the input random variables, the distribution of its variables will be 
used in other fragments of the multi-entity Bayesian network.
Figure 8 shows the fragment of the learner node of our multi-entity Bayesian 
network. There are four random variables in our tutor call (History, System 
Awareness) fragment which concerns a tutor’s call to help the learner based on 
his / her browsing history and to sensitize the system to the case of remediation 
that is represented by the random input variable Remediation (Tutor call). 
Figure 8. The learner fragment of the learner model

169
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
And the variable isE (Passed, Failed) which concerns the validation of the 
evaluation by the learner represented by the input random variable Validation 
Evaluation (obj). The variable isAP (Passed, Failed) which concerns the 
validation of the learning activity by the learner represented by the input 
random variable Validation Learning Activity (obj) .And the variable isP 
(Passed, Failed)which the validation of the pre-test performed by the learner 
represented thanks to the input random variable Validation Pre-test (obj).
The learner in this fragment begins by passing the pre-test of the entry 
through a random variable input validation pre-test (obj). After the validation 
of this condition, the learner is directed to a learning activity, and will be led 
to validate it by reaching the conditions for success of the random variable 
Validation Learning Activity (obj). And finally, the learner will be led to pass 
an evaluation in the random variable Validation Evaluation (obj). In case of 
failure of this assessment, a remediation will be activated in the Random 
Remediation variable which requires a call to the tutor who will help the 
learners in difficulty based on their browsing history.
2. The M-Theory of the Learner Model
Figure 9 shows the M-Theory of the learner model, a set of coherent fragments 
defining a joint distribution on situations involving cases of random variables. 
There are 3 fragments in our M-theory of the learner model such as the 
Pre-Test, the Learning Activity as well as the Evaluation, and finally the 
Learner reference fragment. Each of the MFrags consists of context, input 
and resident nodes.
The multi-entity Bayesian network of the learner model developed can 
be used to estimate and predict a learning situation in adaptive hypermedia 
systems, dynamically tracking in real time all learners’ actions during their 
course. Learning pathways and during their presence in adaptive hypermedia.
The fact that multi-entity Bayesian networks incorporate the ontology 
concept into their modeling part allows the systematic collection and formal 
representation of multiple concepts of learner knowledge. Thus, with Multi-
Entity Bayesian networks, we also aim to exploit the useful functionality of 
ontologies to facilitate a practical and non-error-prone development of the 
part of the representation of learner knowledge within adaptive educational 
hypermedia. Thus, Multi-Entity Bayesian networks combine, for this 
specific problem, the advantages of the two worlds, that is, the expression 
and representation of knowledge on the framework of ontologies and the 

170
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
uncertainty of modeling using probabilistic models on the framework of 
Bayesian networks.
All of the elements discussed above represent the essence of this work. 
The transformation of Bayesian networks developed for the management 
of the learner model to machine-readable language, such as ontologies, or 
as we have already proposed, using probabilistic ontologies as a formalism 
that gives us the possibility of combine Bayesian networks with ontologies 
(Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2014; Anouar Tadlaoui et al., 2018)
CONCLUSION
We have already introduced our learner model using Bayesian networks as 
formalization for learner management. Also, we have covered all phases of 
initialization and updating of this model thanks to the combination of networks 
Figure 9. The M-Theory of the Learner Model in an Adaptive Hypermedia

171
A Learner Model Based on Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks
with other methods and models to ensure a complete management of all 
areas of the learner model. We wanted to take our work to the next level, to 
machine-readable modeling. This is why the main hypothesis of this chapter 
was the management of the learner model based on multi-entity Bayesian 
networks, for a dynamic and probabilistic management of the learner model 
in adaptive hypermedia.
The approach that we followed during this report is marked initially by 
modeling the learner model in three levels: we started with the conceptual 
level of modeling with the unified modeling language, followed by the 
modeling model based on Bayesian networks to be able to achieve probabilistic 
modeling in the three phases of learner modeling. Finally, we have proposed 
in this last chapter a dynamic and probabilistic modeling of this model using 
multi-entity Bayesian networks.
This approach is considered very useful for the learner model, especially 
in the case of a large number of data stored in the system. The transformation 
of the nodes for fragments gives us the possibility of a separate management 
of the data of each fragment, keeping at the same time all types of relations 
of each fragment with the other fragments by using the random variables 
which exist in several fragments within an M-Theory of the learner model.
