Unpacking David Easton definition of politics a critical analysis 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to discuss David Easton’s contribution to political science. 
Easton has  
 
Produced a number of well-known books since The Political System was released in 1953. It is stated 
that in  
 
Order to truly grasp his contribution, one must analyse all of his works in connection to one another. 
His recent  
 
Contribution to political science is highlighted in particular. He chose the political system as the main 
unit of  
 
Study and focused his research and examination on the intra-system behaviour of distinct systems. His 
approach  
 
In applying systems analysis is constructivist, in the sense that he has relied more on the analytic 
system  
 
Approach than the membership systems approach. 
 
Keywords: David Easton, Political System, intra-system behaviour, systems approach. 
Introduction 
David Easton was a prominent political scientist known for his significant contributions to the field of 
political science. He was born in 1917 and passed away in 2014. Easton’s work revolved around 
political systems and behavior. Some of his notable contributions include: 
 

Systems Theory: Easton is best known for his development of the political systems theory, which 
aimed to analyze and understand political systems as complex, interrelated entities. This theory 
emphasized the inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops within political systems. 
 
Behavioral Approach: He was a key figure in advancing the behavioral approach to political science, 
which sought to study political behavior scientifically by applying empirical methods and data analysis. 
 
Concept of Political Socialization: Easton also contributed to our understanding of how individuals 
develop their political beliefs and values through the concept of political socialization. He explored 
how political ideas are transmitted within society. 
 
Political Science Education: Easton had a significant impact on political science education, serving as a 
professor at various universities and influencing the curriculum and pedagogy in the field. 
 
Overall, David Easton’s work significantly shaped the study of political science, particularly in the areas 
of systems theory, political behavior, and political socialization. His contributions continue to influence 
political science research and scholarship today. 
Politics is the process by which societies make collective decisions and allocate resources and power. It 
plays a central role in society as it determines how a community or nation is governed, what laws and 
policies are enacted, and how resources are distributed. Politics also addresses fundamental questions 
about who holds authority and how it’s exercised, shaping the social, economic, and cultural aspects 
of a society. It involves various actors, from elected officials and governments to interest groups and 
citizens, all engaging in a complex interplay to influence the direction and functioning of a community 
or nation. Politics ultimately shapes the framework within which societies function, impacting 
people’s lives and shaping the course of history. 
Certainly, let’s delve deeper into the concept of politics and its central role in society: 
Governance and Decision-Making: Politics encompasses the mechanisms through which decisions are 
made and implemented in a society. This includes everything from choosing leaders through elections 
to the establishment of laws and policies. These decisions have far-reaching effects on various aspects 
of people’s lives, from education and healthcare to taxes and public safety. 
 
Resource Allocation: Politics determines how a society allocates its resources. This includes financial 
resources through budgeting and taxation, as well as the allocation of public services like 
infrastructure, healthcare, and education. Decisions in these areas can significantly impact the quality 
of life for citizens. 
 

Conflict Resolution: In any society, there are competing interests and values. Politics provides a 
structured way to manage and resolve conflicts among individuals and groups. This can involve 
negotiation, compromise, and the establishment of laws to ensure a fair and orderly society. 
 
Power and Authority: Politics deals with questions of power and authority. It defines who has the right 
to make decisions, enforce laws, and maintain order. Political systems can range from autocracies with 
centralized power to democracies where authority is distributed among the people through elections. 
 
Social and Economic Policies: Politics shapes social and economic policies, which, in turn, influence 
income distribution, access to education and healthcare, and the overall standard of living. For 
example, decisions on taxation and welfare programs can impact income inequal

The authoritative nature of politics  
 
 
 
Politics is inherently authoritative in nature as it revolves around the allocation and exercise of power 
within a society. Here are some key points highlighting its authoritative aspects: 
 
Power and Decision-Making: Politics involves the authority to make decisions that impact a 
community or nation. These decisions can range from economic policies to social regulations, and they 
shape the lives of individuals within that political system. 
 
Government and Institutions: The government, as a central component of politics, holds authority 
over various aspects of society, including law enforcement, taxation, and public services. These 
institutions enforce the rules and regulations established by the governing authority. 
 
Legislation and Regulation: Governments create and enforce laws and regulations that dictate 
acceptable behavior within their jurisdiction. This legal framework is authoritative, as it prescribes 
what is allowed and what is prohibited. 
 
Monopoly on Force: The state typically holds a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within its 
borders, which is a fundamental aspect of authority. This authority is used to maintain order and 
security, but it also has the potential for abuse. 

 
Representation and Accountability: In democratic systems, political authority is derived from the 
consent of the governed through elections. Elected representatives exercise authority on behalf of the 
people, but they are also held accountable for their actions through democratic processes. 
 
International Relations: Politics extends beyond national borders. International politics involve 
negotiations, treaties, and international organizations, where countries exercise authority in global 
affairs. 
 
Social Control: Politics can influence societal norms and values, exerting authority over cultural and 
moral dimensions. For example, political leaders may influence public opinion on issues like human 
rights or environmental conservation. 
 
Resource Allocation: Politics often involves the distribution of resources, such as budget allocations for 
public programs and services. The authority to decide how resources are distributed can have a 
profound impact on the well-being of citizens. 
 
In essence, politics is the arena where authority is defined, contested, and exercised. The extent and 
nature of this authority can vary widely depending on the type of government and its relationship 
with the governed, but authority is a fundamental aspect of political systems worldwide. 
Chapter 2  
The allocation of values in politics 
The allocation of values in politics refers to how societal values, priorities, and resources are 
distributed or prioritized within a political system. It’s a complex and dynamic process influenced by 
various factors. Here’s a discussion of key aspects related to the allocation of values in politics: 
 
Policy Prioritization: Political actors, such as governments and policymakers, play a crucial role in 
determining which values and issues receive priority. They make decisions about allocating resources, 
setting policies, and addressing certain problems based on the perceived importance of these issues to 
the public and the nation. 
 
Economic Allocation: One significant aspect is the allocation of economic resources. Government 
budgets allocate funds to various sectors like education, healthcare, defense, and infrastructure. These 
allocations reflect the government’s priorities and values, such as investing in education to promote a 
skilled workforce or allocating resources for healthcare to ensure the well-being of citizens. 

 
Social Values: Politics also influences the allocation of values related to social issues. For example, 
debates over issues like marriage equality, reproductive rights, and immigration policy reflect differing 
societal values. Political decisions and legislation can either uphold or challenge prevailing social 
norms and values. 
 
Environmental Considerations: Environmental values are increasingly important in politics. Decisions 
related to environmental protection, climate change mitigation, and resource conservation reflect the 
allocation of values concerning the long-term sustainability of the planet. 
 
Justice and Equity: Politics often grapples with questions of justice and equity. Policies related to 
income distribution, affirmative action, and social welfare programs aim to allocate values more 
equitably across society, addressing issues of fairness and opportunity. 
 
International Relations: The allocation of values extends to international politics. Foreign policy 
decisions reflect a country’s values and interests on a global scale, impacting issues like human rights, 
trade, and conflict resolution. 
 
Public Opinion and Democracy: In democratic systems, the allocation of values is influenced by public 
opinion. Elected representatives are expected to align their decisions with the values and preferences 
of their constituents, making the allocation of values a dynamic and responsive process. 
 
Cultural and Ethical Values: Politics can also impact cultural and ethical values, as debates over issues 
like censorship, freedom of speech, and cultural preservation reflect differing perspectives on what 
values should be prioritized within a society. 
 
It’s important to note that the allocation of values in politics is often a contested and evolving process. 
Different political parties, interest groups, and individuals may have divergent views on what values 
should be prioritized. As a result, political systems provide mechanisms for negotiation, compromise, 
and democratic decision-making to determine how societal values are allocated and reflected in policy 
and governance. 
 
 

The allocation of values in politics refers to how political decisions and policies reflect and prioritize 
certain values and principles within a society. This allocation is a fundamental aspect of the political 
process and can greatly influence the direction of a nation. Here are key aspects to consider: 
 
Value Hierarchy: Political systems often have a hierarchy of values that guide decision-making. These 
values can include principles such as liberty, equality, justice, security, and economic prosperity. The 
relative importance assigned to each value varies among different political ideologies and leaders. 
 
Policy Prioritization: Political leaders and governments make choices about which issues to address 
and how to allocate resources and attention to them. This process reflects the values they believe are 
most important or urgent at a given time. 
 
Resource Allocation: Government budgets are a clear reflection of value allocation. The allocation of 
funds to sectors like education, healthcare, defense, and infrastructure reflects the government’s 
values and priorities. For example, a government that prioritizes healthcare may allocate a larger 
portion of its budget to the healthcare system. 
 
Social and Cultural Values: Politics also plays a role in shaping and reflecting societal values. Policies 
related to cultural preservation, freedom of speech, and social norms are influenced by the prevailing 
values and the political climate. 
 
Environmental Values: Environmental issues, such as climate change and conservation, increasingly 
influence political decision-making. The allocation of resources and policies related to environmental 
sustainability reflect a society’s commitment to preserving the planet for future generations. 
 
Justice and Equity: Political decisions often revolve around issues of justice and equity. Policies related 
to income distribution, social welfare programs, and criminal justice reflect the values of fairness and 
addressing societal inequalities. 
 
International Relations: The allocation of values extends to foreign policy. Decisions regarding 
alliances, trade agreements, and humanitarian interventions are guided by a nation’s values and 
interests on the global stage. 
 

Public Opinion and Democracy: In democratic systems, the allocation of values is closely tied to public 
opinion. Elected officials are expected to represent the values and preferences of their constituents, 
making the allocation of values responsive to the changing views of the electorate. 
 
Ethical and Moral Values: Political debates often involve ethical and moral considerations. Topics such 
as abortion, euthanasia, and human rights reflect differing ethical values within society. 
 
It’s important to recognize that the allocation of values is a dynamic process influenced by changing 
circumstances, societal developments, and shifts in public opinion. Political systems provide 
mechanisms for negotiation, compromise, and democratic decision-making to determine how values 
are allocated and translated into policy. As society evolve so do values that guides our poltical choices 
.

The roles of values in politics 
 
 
Values play a crucial role in politics, influencing various aspects of political decision-making and 
shaping the direction of a society. Here are some key roles of values in politics: 
 
Policy Formation: Values guide the creation of policies and laws, as they reflect the moral and ethical 
principles that a society or political leader holds dear. For example, a commitment to individual liberty 
may lead to policies promoting civil rights and freedoms. 
 
Voter Preferences: Voters often align with political candidates and parties that share their values. This 
influences elections and can determine which policies and leaders gain support. 
 
Political Ideology: Values are at the core of political ideologies, such as liberalism, conservatism, 
socialism, or libertarianism. These ideologies offer frameworks for addressing complex political issues. 
 
Ethical Decision-Making: Politicians and government officials must make ethical decisions based on 
their values. These decisions can impact issues like healthcare, education, and foreign policy. 
 
Social and Cultural Norms: Values are intertwined with cultural and social norms. Political decisions 
can either reinforce or challenge these norms, shaping societal attitudes and behaviors. 

 
Conflict Resolution: Values can lead to political conflicts when different groups hold opposing beliefs. 
Negotiating and finding common ground often require an understanding of each side’s values 
In summary, values are a fundamental aspect of politics, shaping the beliefs and actions of individuals, 
political parties, and nations, and playing a crucial role in policy-making, governance, and societal 
cohesion. 
 
Critisms and arguments against David Easton definition of politics 
David Easton’s definition of politics, which views politics as the authoritative allocation of values in 
society, has faced several criticisms over the years. Some of the key criticisms include: 
 
Narrow Focus on Authoritative Allocation: Critics argue that Easton’s definition places too much 
emphasis on the authoritative allocation of values, which tends to reduce politics to a top-down, 
government-centric process. This perspective may not fully capture the complexities of modern 
politics, where power and influence are dispersed among various actors, including non-governmental 
organizations and the private sector. 
 
Neglect of Political Participation: Easton’s definition does not sufficiently address the role of political 
participation and citizen engagement in politics. Critics argue that politics involves not only the 
allocation of values but also the active involvement of citizens in shaping policies and decisions, which 
is largely overlooked in his definition. 
 
Cultural and Social Aspects: Critics contend that Easton’s definition does not adequately account for 
the cultural and social dimensions of politics. Politics is not solely about resource allocation but also 
involves cultural values, identity, and social norms that can influence decision-making and power 
dynamics. 
 
Static and Descriptive: Easton’s definition has been criticized for being overly static and descriptive. It 
describes what politics does but does not provide much insight into why certain values are allocated in 
particular ways or how political systems evolve over time. 
 
Lack of Normative Element: Some critics argue that Easton’s definition lacks a normative dimension. It 
does not address questions of justice, ethics, or morality in politics, which are essential considerations 
for many scholars and practitioners. 
 

Applicability to Non-State Actors: Easton’s definition primarily focuses on the state as the authoritative 
actor in politics. In today’s globalized world, where non-state actors, such as multinational 
corporations and international organizations, wield significant influence, this focus may not fully 
capture the dynamics of power and decision-making. 
 
Simplification: Easton’s definition has been accused of oversimplifying the complex nature of politics. 
Politics is not just about allocation but also about the contestation of values and interests, negotiation, 
compromise, and conflict resolution. 
 
In summary, while David Easton’s definition of politics has been influential in political science, it is not 
without its critics. Many argue that it provides a limited perspective on politics, and there is a need for 
more comprehensive and nuanced approaches that consider the diverse and evolving nature of 
political processes and actors. 
 
Scholars have proposed various alternative definitions of politics, reflecting the complexity and 
multifaceted nature of the subject. Here are a few alternative definitions of politics offered by 
prominent scholars: 
 
Harold Lasswell: Lasswell defined politics as “who gets what, when, and how.” This definition 
emphasizes the distribution of resources and power in society, highlighting the core element of 
allocation. 
 
Aristotle: Aristotle defined politics as “the science of the city-state.” He viewed politics as the study of 
how people come together to create and maintain a community, addressing issues of governance, 
justice, and citizenship. 
 
Hannah Arendt: Arendt considered politics as “the activity of acting together.” She focused on the 
public sphere, where people engage in collective decision-making and deliberation to address 
common concerns. 
Conclusion 
At last, we can say that there is a morality of the common people be this power and  
 
The common people accept that powerful person then he/she can be called authority. One the other  
 

Hand, authority as a concept, can be used to mean the right to exercise of power given by the state  
 
Or the academic knowledge of an area or in societies, by higher spiritual power. A good authority  
 
Can move a society or towards progress with the right direction. Authority plays an important role  
 
For every society.  
 
Politics is not described in a world. The extent of politics is very large. Because it is predominating  
 
Everywhere. Politics is something that can not be avoided in human life. It can be found in the  
 
Government of a country, town, political party, civic, association and many other organizations for  
 
This reason Aristotle said that,  
 
“politics exists everywhere.”  
 
Politics is all about the rule of order, to put everyone in society in their right niche, for true  
 
Development
