Abstract  
A complete map  𝑀𝑀𝑛𝑛 consists of n disk-like regions, where every “country” shares a non-zero-length border-line 
with all the other 𝑛𝑛−1 countries.  Different methods are described for constructing easy-to-understand 
visualization models of complete maps.  One useful representation takes the form of a 2-layered “pillow-case” 
forming a disk with a minimum number of tunnels.  Results are presented for complete maps with eight to twelve 
countries on symmetrical handle-bodies of genus-2 through genus-6. 
  
Introduction 
Complete Maps are duals of Complete Graphs, in which every node is connected to all the other nodes.  
Complete Map 𝑀𝑀𝑛𝑛 consists of n simply connected regions, where every “country” shares a non-zero-length 
border-line with all the other n ‒ 1 countries.  Every country has the topology of a disk.  Maps with up to 
four countries can be drawn on a sphere or some other genus-0 surface.  Map 𝑀𝑀4 has the connectivity of a 
tetrahedron.  Maps with 5 to 7 countries can be embedded on a toroidal body of genus 1.  Maps 𝑀𝑀5 and 
𝑀𝑀6 can be drawn with different connectivity, which may be conveyed in several different ways.  The most 
abstract way is a rotation system in the form of a small table (Figure 1(a)) that lists for each country in 
cyclical order the other n ‒ 1 countries that it touches.  Figure 1(a) describes the layout of the complete 
graph 𝐾𝐾6 shown in Figure 1(b).  The underlined numbers in Figure 1(a) are the edges that form the unique 
hexagonal region in this graph layout [7]; all other regions are triangular.  The complete hexagonal map 
(Figure 1(b)) can be turned into a torus by identifying opposite edges. While this diagram is highly 
symmetrical, it loses this symmetry when it is curled up into a torus, and it is not immediately clear what 
the individual countries on the toroidal surface will look like. 
The complete graph 𝐾𝐾6, and thus 𝑀𝑀6, can also be drawn on a torus with 3-fold dihedral rotational 
symmetry (Figure 1(c)).  Here the torus is formed by gluing together opposite edges in the marked 
rectangular area.  A single picture or diagram is typically sufficient to describe the layouts of these maps 
on a genus-1 surface.

More physical models may be constructed from tubular crochet segments that are stitched together into 
intricate handle-bodies [2], or they may result from joining n regular felt polygons with n ‒ 1 sides, which 
are sewn together along their edges.  Suitable handle-bodies have even been constructed from dozens of 
specially designed origami tiles by Eve Torrence [10, 11].  All of these physical models are intriguing 
objects to be explored by touch; however, they do not readily reveal the topology of the underlying map. 

 
 
My goal is to present views of complete maps on symmetrical handle-bodies that can be recognized readily 
from one or two (front & back) pictures.  The challenge starts with 8 countries on a genus-2 handle-body.  
Heawood’s formula [6] specifies the minimal genus required for a map with n countries:   
Genus  g = ceiling [ (n ‒ 3) (n ‒ 4) / 12 ].   
Handle-bodies of genus g are often represented in the shape of a g-hole torus, i.e., a fat disk with g 
tunnels passing through it from front to back.  On such a handle-body, the layout of the map can be shown 
with colored diagrams of the front and back sides of the disk.  These two layers are stitched together along 
the outer contour of the disk and along all the g rims of the tunnels, thus forming a kind of flattened “pillow-
case,” which would expand into a nicely rounded g-hole torus when inflated.  The front- and back-surfaces 
may also be printed out, glued together, and the holes may be cut out to make it easy to see how countries 
are connected when they extend through holes or around the outer rim of the disk.   
Unfortunately, I don’t know any general algorithm that can construct such models.  My search for 
good models has been ad hoc and rather tedious.  In this paper, I focus on complete maps with 8 to 12 
countries, and I present the solutions with the highest symmetries that I have found.  Sometimes, the chosen 
handle-body can be a g-hole torus, possibly with g-fold rotational symmetry, or with (g‒1)-fold symmetry, 
where one hole is placed in the center.  However, the symmetry of the complete map will typically be lower 
because the layout of the various countries cannot adhere to the symmetry of the handle-body.  To find 
good solutions, I have followed a few different approaches.  They will be described, in turn, in the context 
of the maps where they have led to useful results.   
 
Pillowcase Extraction,  𝒏𝒏= 𝟖𝟖 
Constructing a pillowcase model for a complete map with eight countries on a genus-2 handle-body was 
not too difficult since Susan Goldstine has created several physical models of such an 8-color map based 
on information found in [2].  One of her models is a ceramic tea pot and cup, suitably painted with eight 
colors [3].  In another model, eight heptagonal crochet tiles have been joined edge-to-edge to form a 2-hole 
torus (Figure 2(a)).  Based on her Bridges paper [4], I have extracted a corresponding embedding of the 
complete graph 𝐾𝐾8 on a 2-hole torus (Figure 2(b)).  The solid lines are on the front, and the dashed lines are 
on the backside.  This network of curves partitions the surface of the 2-hole torus into 16 triangular faces 
plus two quadrilaterals. A suitably refined dual representation then leads to the map shown in Figure 2(c,d) 
(front & back).  The border lines between the eight countries form a network with 16 junction points of 
valence 3 and with two valence-4 junctions (at centers of the top and bottom).  When half of Figure 2(c,d) 
is folded back to form a 2-hole torus, the overall world exhibits simple 𝐶𝐶2 symmetry, with the 𝐶𝐶2 rotation 
axis running vertically through the middle of the folded figure.

 (c,d) resulting pillow-case model of M8 showing front & back of an unfolded 2-hole torus. 
 

 
 
The model depicted in Figure 2(c,d) is already easy to visualize.  I have tried to find a simpler layout, 
possibly with a higher degree of symmetry by moving all the nodes to different locations on the 2-hole 
torus.  I moved the red and yellow (black and blue) nodes from the top (and bottom) of the 2-hole stencil 
to the inner rims of the two holes.  Similarly, the white and orange (green and gray) nodes have been moved 
towards the middle of the side rims of the 2-hole disk.  This results in the “less crowded” graph embedding 
(Figure 3(a)).  The solid black lines are on the front, and the dashed red lines are on the backside.  Making 
the latter pattern on the back the same as the one on the front, guarantees overall 𝐶𝐶2 symmetry.  To convert 
this into the dual map 𝑀𝑀8, I consider the nodes of the 𝐾𝐾8 graph to be the “capitals” of each country, and the 
arcs in the graph to be direct “highways” between neighboring capitals.  About half-way along each 
highway, I expect to find the border between the two countries.  Up to those border points I color the 
highways with the same color as the capital.  This yields a good indication of the extent of each country 
and its overall shape.  By connecting such border points and simplifying and smoothing the resulting shape, 
I then obtain the 8-country map shown in Figure 3(c,d).  This world still has overall 𝐶𝐶2 symmetry.

The Dual of a Symmetrical Graph Embedding,  n = 9 
A complete map of nine countries must be accommodated on a handle-body with a genus of at least 3.  For 
this case, I had no nicely colored model that I could use as a starting point.  So, I started by trying to draw 
the complete graph 𝐾𝐾9 on a 3-hole torus with 3-fold rotational symmetry.  The nine nodes of the complete 
graph 𝐾𝐾9 can be placed on the rims of the three holes, while maintaining the 3-fold rotational symmetry.  I 
also managed to place all the 36 edges of the graph, while maintaining at least 𝐶𝐶3 symmetry. This resulted 
in a map with 22 triangular facets and one hexagonal region (Figure 4(a)).  I have marked the triangular 
regions between the graph edges with small triangles.  The dark ones are on the front surface of the torus; 
the white ones are on the back, and the ones with a dark outline stretch from front to back.   
Figure 4(b) shows a physical model made out of nine felt octagons by Ellie Baker [1].  It is based on 
Heffter’s 1890 rotation system for 𝑛𝑛= 9 [7], which she found in a paper by Moria Chas [2].  This model 
also has a “hexagonal” region, but one that twice uses the same vertex. This results in a map in which one 
country wraps around a toroidal arm and reuses one of its border vertices, forming a special valence-6 
junction-point. 
With the goal of obtaining overall 𝐷𝐷3 symmetry, I investigated different embeddings of 𝐾𝐾9.  By moving 
three of the vertices to the outer rim of the disk, I obtained a map with 20 triangular regions plus four 
quadrilaterals.  Those quadrilaterals must map symmetrically onto themselves when one performs the flips 
around the three 𝐶𝐶2 axes.  In addition, the layout on the front and on the back would have to look the same.  
But most my efforts ended up in something like Figure 4(c)), exhibiting just 𝐶𝐶3 symmetry.   

 
 
         
         
   
                                (a)                                                (b)                                              (c)

(c) A different embedding of K9 with three quadrilateral facets. 
 
Eventually I found the layout shown in Figure 5(a).  This layout first shows six quadrilateral regions, three 
of which must be split to accommodate the complete graph 𝐾𝐾9.  These three edges, marked in black-and-
white, could either lie on the front of the disk or on its backside, thus reducing the symmetry again down 
to 𝐶𝐶3.  However, by placing such edges on both sides, one can obtain 𝐷𝐷3 symmetry.  The price one pays is 
that the graph 𝐾𝐾9 now has three redundant edges, and the map 𝑀𝑀9 (Figure 5(b,c)) has three pairs of countries 
with two segments of shared borders (running through two different holes).  For other complete maps, it 
also turns out that a few redundant border lines can lead to an embedding with higher symmetry.

Combinations of Simpler Maps,  n = 10 
Several attempts to find a good layout of 𝐾𝐾10 on a 4-hole torus, using the direct method that worked for 𝑀𝑀9, 
did not lead to a valid solution.  A somewhat different approach starts with a smaller complete map and 
then adds some extra handles or tunnels to bring in additional colors.  Starting with 𝑀𝑀9, we could add only 
a single handle which would then need to bring in one new color and connect it to all existing nine colors.  
I don’t see how this is possible without substantially rearranging the layout of the 𝑀𝑀9 component.   
Starting with 𝑀𝑀8 and adding two handles and two colors is more promising.  The two handles can be 
combined into a single bridge with three branches, and this bridge then forms a genus-0 surface with three 
punctures.  From these three punctures, three tubular connectors then must match up with three suitably 
placed punctures in the map 𝑀𝑀8, so that all new, required, pair-wise country-connections are realized.  This 
approach generalizes to a technique in which two maps with fewer countries and lower genus form a 
connected sum with the desired properties.  Moira Chas and her students show how a complete map of 
lower genus can be enhanced by combining it with b-way “branching bridges” to form a connected sum of 
higher genus [5].  Such an add-on bridge can be seen as a genus-0 surface with b punctures, which can carry 

 
 
up to four additional countries with new colors.  The b open tubular ends of the branching bridge must then 
be inserted judiciously into the starting map so that all the new countries contact all the original countries 
in the starting map.   
This approach leads to valid, tangible 3D models, where crocheted add-on bridges are stitched into 
crocheted handle-bodies.  However, it is difficult to understand the resulting topology of such a model from 
just one or two pictures.  To construct easy-to-visualize “pillowcase” representations, I need to do some 
extra work to place the add-on bridges into the dominant plane of the initial multi-hole disk — either by 
forming handles around the outer rim of the disk, or by inserting small “spidery” networks in some of the 
holes of the starting handle-body.   
Based on the above approach, Eve Torrence [10] suggested starting with 𝑀𝑀8 on a genus-2 surface and 
forming a connected sum with 𝑀𝑀2 on a torus.  In Figure 6(a,b), the torus is represented by the small white 
square, through which the blue and brown color regions connect with one another. Two connectors carrying 
both new colors connect to the top and bottom of the 8-country map shown in Figure 2(c,d), where there 
are valence-4 border points.  At these two locations, the two new countries contact each of four countries 
in 𝑀𝑀8.  Since the new component is a torus, we can wrap it around the 𝑀𝑀8 component (Figure 6(c,d)).

(c,d) The same map redrawn with the torus wound around the M8 component.  (e,f) A connected sum 
 between a torus with 6 countries and a genus-0, 4-way branching bridge with 4 countries. 
 
More recently I found that I could make a valid 10-country map without redundant edges by starting with 
a 6-country torus and adding a 4-branch bridge with four new colors, where each branch carries three of 
those colors (Figure 6(e,f)).  Finding this solution was not easy.  I started from a map like the one shown in 
Figure 1(c)), carrying the six colors (Pink, Cyan, Lime, Silver, Orange, Violet).  For the connection points 
with the 𝑀𝑀4 component I picked two valence-4 points and two valence-3 points, about equally spaced 
around the torus (Figure 7(a)). Next I had to pick the proper colors at those connection points, so that I 
obtain all 4 × 6 = 24 color combinations between the 𝑀𝑀6 and 𝑀𝑀4 components (Figure 7(b)).  Furthermore, 
I had to make sure that I could warp the 𝑀𝑀4 component, which is a tetrahedron with four punctures at the 
corners, in the proper way to fit the four connectors in the proper sequence around the inner perimeter of 
the torus.  A little paper-strip model helped in figuring out the right amount of twisting in the four connector 
tubes (Figure 7(c)).

Given that I had to use two valence-4 points and two valence-3 points for the tie-in of the 𝑀𝑀4 component, 
there is no hope for 4-fold rotational symmetry.  But I was able to use the same layout on the front and on 
the back of the pillow-case model; so I was able to achieve at least 𝐶𝐶2 symmetry around the vertical axis 
that flips the front into the back of this “pillow-case.” 
       
A Tough Challenge,  n = 11 
Among the complete maps that I have tried to model, 𝑀𝑀11 presented the biggest challenge.  I made several 
attempts to directly find an embedding of 𝐾𝐾11 in a nice, symmetrical 5-hole torus, but none of them 
succeeded.  Also, I had no example of a physical model made by crocheting or by stitching together eleven 
decagon patches.  Thus, I focused on the topological approach of making a connected sum of two smaller 
complete maps.  Moira Chas’ students, Y. Gu, C. Stewart, and A. Yamin [5] present a topological 
description based on the connected sum of 𝑀𝑀8 on a genus-2 surface (Figure 8(a)) and 𝑀𝑀3 on a sphere with 
four punctures (Figure 8(b)). This representation allows easy verification that all required color 
combinations occur along finite border lines.  However, it does not convey a good visualization of the 
resulting handle-body with the 11 countries on its surface.  Even a physical model in which I connected the 
𝑀𝑀8 component on top of a pillow-case model of 𝑀𝑀8 (Figure 8(c)) does not give me a good picture of what 
the eleven countries drawn on a 5-hole torus would look like. 
                 
 
                                     (a)                                        (b)                                                 (c) 
Figure 8:  (a,b) Topological model of M11 [5].  (c) Paper model of M11 on a genus-5 surface. 
 
With the aim of creating a better visualization model, I first rearranged the map 𝑀𝑀8 (Figure 8(a)) so that the 
four connection vertices all fall onto the perimeter of the folded pillow-case model of 𝑀𝑀8 (Figure 9(a)).  By 
further stretching the left half and compressing the right half, I was able to line up the two holes in the front 
and back sheets as well as the four connection points on the perimeter.  Adding a suitably stretched and 
twisted layout of 𝑀𝑀3, provided all the needed color-pairings at the four connection points (Figure 9(b)).

Trying to find a more symmetrical layout, I looked at some other combinations of smaller complete maps 
— in particular, combinations of tori, with the hope to find a layout similar to Figure 6(e,f).  Promising 

 
 
combinations are: either  𝑀𝑀7 plus  𝑀𝑀4, or  𝑀𝑀6 plus  𝑀𝑀5, on genus-1 surfaces with four connector tubes 
between them.  I found a pleasing  𝐷𝐷4 symmetrical layout for  𝑀𝑀4 on a torus (Figure 10(a,b)), where every 
connector (Figure 10(c)) carries all four colors.  So, I started my exploration with the latter model, using 
the same approach as in Figure 7.  Now there are 14 valence-3 junction points to choose from.  I am still 
struggling with this!

A Symmetrical 3D Model,  n = 12 
Almost twenty years ago, I found a symmetrical embedding of 𝐾𝐾12 on a genus-6 surface that preserves the 
symmetry of an oriented tetrahedron [8].  The key step was to place the twelve nodes in twelve equivalent 
places with strongly negative Gaussian curvature (Figure 11(a)); this allowed the eleven edges going to 
other nodes to branch out without undue local congestion.  I then made a physical model of a tubular genus-
6 surface, onto which I could stick all 66 edges (Figure 11(b)).  I now have made a corresponding computer 
graphics model of 𝐾𝐾12 (Figure11(c)).  To find the dual, 𝑀𝑀12, I picked twelve different colors for the nodes 
and recolored the edges as follows:  each edge takes on the color of the node that it emerges from and keeps 
it up to the half-way point (Figure 11(d)); it then becomes a possible border point between two countries. 
    
         
    
 
                        (a)                                 (b)                                        (c)                                (d)

 (c,d) Two more views of map M12 on a genus-6 handle-body with tetrahedral symmetry.   

 
 
Next, I repartitioned the surface of the polyhedral handle-body and matched the surface colors in all 
locations to the colors of the “roads” running through those areas (Figure 12(a)).  Figure 12(b) shows a 
single country with all the graph half-edges emerging from that country’s “capital.”  I then combined twelve 
copies of this one country into a single surface using the symmetry of the oriented tetrahedron.  As a final 
test, I ran this combined surface through Stratasys’ Quickslice program to make sure that together they form 
the water-tight boundary representation of a handle-body. Figures 12(c, d) show the map 𝑀𝑀12 with twelve 
identical countries after removal of the graph edges. 
 
Conclusions, Future Work 
For complete maps with more than seven countries it is not easy to convey the geometry of the handle-body 
and of the various countries with just one or two images.  The pillowcase model is a useful representation.  
By showing front- and back-sides, it conveys all needed information.  This also can be turned into simple 
physical model by printing out the two views and gluing them together.  On such a model, it is easy to 
follow the geometries of convoluted countries that pass through any tunnels or wind around the perimeter.  
Unfortunately, I have no general recipe how to find such pillowcase models.  A few different 
approaches have been described that worked for maps with 8 to 11 countries.  They will probably also work 
for maps with more than a dozen countries, although it may be difficult to predict which method works best 
for which map.  An open question remains as to what the maximum possible symmetry might be for a 
particular complete map.  Also, it seems worthwhile to find more structured techniques for combining 
smaller maps into the desired one.  Is there a way to tell what combinations of maps will most likely succeed 
and lead to pleasing, symmetrical results? 
Some maps, like 𝑀𝑀12, are highly regular and can be embedded symmetrically on handle-bodies with 
the symmetry of one of the Platonic or Archimedean solids.  For these maps it would be counter-productive 
to reduce the symmetry of the presentation to that of a 2-dimensional pillowcase.  They may lead to 
informative and pleasing 3D-print models.  But then, what would be the best way to convey the shape of 
an individual country in just one or two 2D images?
