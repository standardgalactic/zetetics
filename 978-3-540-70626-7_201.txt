The equipartition theorem states that the average energy associated with each sep-
arable, quadratic term in the Hamiltonian results in a thermal energy of 1/2 RT per
mole, where R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature. This theorem,
which emerged early in the history of kinetic theory in the nineteenth century, was
quickly found to be in sharp disagreement with experiment, particularly for gases.
Thus, for a monatomic ideal gas with three translational and three rotational de-
grees of freedom, the equipartition theorem predicts that the thermal energy per
mole is 3 RT, and the speciﬁc heat at constant volume CV is 3R. This result is of-
ten expressed in terms of γ , the ratio of the speciﬁc heats at constant pressure and
volume. For this case, γ = CP /CV = 4/3, since for one mole of an ideal gas,
CP = CV + R. The same result obtains for a diatomic gas if the two gas atoms are
rigidly connected. If they are instead connected by a massless spring (with quadratic
terms in both kinetic and potential energy), one ﬁnds CV = 4R, and γ = 5/4.
Experiments told a different story. Experiments on monatomic gases over a wide
range of temperatures consistently found CV = 3/2R, or γ = 5/3, corresponding to
three translational degrees of freedom. Apparently, monatomic gases did not rotate.
Experiments at room temperature on common diatomic gases such as oxygen and
nitrogen yielded γ = 7/5, corresponding to three translational and two rotational
degrees of freedom. One rotational degree of freedom was missing; and apparently
the molecules did not vibrate. At higher temperatures, however, the speciﬁc heat
steadily increased, suggesting an inexplicable gradual onset of additional degrees of
freedom. To make matters worse, atomic and molecular spectra hinted at additional
internal degrees of freedom that did not contribute to speciﬁc heats.
Nineteenth-century physicists were perplexed and alarmed by these discrep-
ancies. James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) in 1875 said that they constituted
“the greatest difﬁculty yet encountered by the molecular theory.” Lord Kelvin
(1824–1907) in 1901 considered them one of the “two clouds” hanging over
nineteenth-century physics. Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) in his Lectures on
Gas Theory argued that the energy of rotation about an axis of symmetry would
not change in collisions, or would at best change very slowly. And Max Planck,
in the preface to his 1897 thermodynamics text, spoke of “Obstacles, at present
insurmountable” standing in the way of kinetic theory.
The situation with solids was more promising. As early as 1818, the French
scientists Pierre Louis Dulong (1785–1838) and Alexis Th´er`ese Petit (1791–1820)
showed that the speciﬁc heats of most solids were about 6 cal mole−1K−1, or 3R,
a value that, as Boltzmann pointed out, agreed nicely with the equipartition law.
The few exceptions occasioned little concern: The speciﬁc heat of diamond, for ex-
ample, was about 1.5 cal mole−1K−1 at room temperatures, but fell to 0.76 at 220 K,
and approached the equipartition value only at temperatures well above 1000 K.

Speciﬁc Heats
This state of affairs changed as a result of two developments. First, the ability
to liquefy gases such as oxygen and nitrogen in the late 1870s, and hydrogen in
the late 1890s, permitted scientists to measure the speciﬁc heats of matter at low
temperatures. This advance was in large part due to Sir James Dewar (1842–1923)in
England, and later, to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (1853–1926) in Leiden and Walther
Nernst (1864–1941) in Germany. Second, the development of quantum theory in the
early years of the twentieth century showed a way out of the dilemmas posed by the
equipartition theorem ( Quantum theory, early period,  Black-body radiation).
Thus in 1907, Albert Einstein used Max Planck’s quantized resonators to predict
that the speciﬁc heats of solids should fall off from the value 3R at room temperature
to zero at low temperatures – the equipartition theorem, which assumes continuous
energies, no longer holds in quantum theory. For conﬁrmation, Einstein could point
only to the speciﬁc heat of diamond. But over the next several years his theory was
brilliantly conﬁrmed by the experiments on the speciﬁc heats of solids conducted by
Walther Nernst and his students in Berlin. They developed new and innovative ex-
perimental techniques, including platinum thermometers and vacuum calorimetry,
as they learned to measure speciﬁc heats accurately over a wide range of tempera-
tures down to the temperature of liquid hydrogen. By 1910, Nernst and his students
had measured the speciﬁc heats of numerous solids, and shown that they did indeed
approach zero at low temperatures, much as predicted by Einstein’s theory. More
quantitatively accurate theories were soon developed by Max Born (1882–1970)
and Theodore von K´arm´an (1881–1963), and by Peter Debye (1884–1966).
Nernst also took the lead in measuring the speciﬁc heats of gases. In 1911, he
noted that quantum theory might well be the key to understanding the discrepancies
between the equipartition theorem and the measured speciﬁc heats. He proposed
hydrogen as a particularly promising candidate for investigation, and the following
year his assistant, Arnold Eucken (1884–1950), used a vacuum calorimeter to show
that the speciﬁc heat of hydrogen gas at constant volume fell from just under the
equipartition value of 5/2 R at room temperature to 3/2 R at about 40 K. The ro-
tational degrees of freedom had frozen out due to quantum effects, much as Nernst
had predicted.
Over the next 15 years, numerous theorists attempted to ﬁnd quantitatively ac-
curate theories for the speciﬁc heat of hydrogen. These attempts were notably
unsuccessful until the development of modern quantum mechanics beginning
in 1925. Finally, in 1927, the American physicist David Dennison (1900–1976)
showed how to use the quantum mechanical theory of indistinguishable particles to
ﬁnd an accurate description of the speciﬁc heat of hydrogen.
It is remarkable that so commonplace a quantity as the speciﬁc heat should have
played such a central role in early quantum theory. Moreover, the experimental and
theoretical study of speciﬁc heats played an important part in the physics, chemistry,
and technology of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in ways that extend far
beyond quantum theory, although a full treatment is beyond the scope of this essay.

Spectroscopic data, together with  scattering experiments, were probably the most
important experimental input to the development of  quantum theory and early
quantum mechanics. Not a discipline in its own right (see [6]), spectroscopy was
practiced within chemistry, optics and astrophysics and has a history extending far
back. Discontinuous features in the spectra of sunlight and from the ﬂames of vari-
ous substances were the subject of intense study throughout the nineteenth century.
As early as 1815, the Munich optician Joseph Fraunhofer (1787–1826) published
a detailed map of the solar spectrum exhibiting about 350 dark lines. He realized
these dark lines could serve as useful markers for speciﬁc colors in the otherwise
