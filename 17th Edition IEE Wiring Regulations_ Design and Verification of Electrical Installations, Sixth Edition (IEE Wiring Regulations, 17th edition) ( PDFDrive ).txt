 Preface 
The aim of this book is to help the reader to approach the drawing 
and interpretation of electrical diagrams with confidence, to under-
stand the principles of testing and to apply this knowledge to fault 
finding in electrical circuits.  
The abundant colour diagrams with associated comments and expla-
nations lead from the basic symbols and simple circuit and wiring 
diagrams, through more complex circuitry, to specific types of wiring 
systems and, finally, to the methodical approach to fault finding.  
The new edition has been brought fully in line with the 17th Edition 
IEE Wiring Regulations.

 Diagrams  
This is an area often overlooked or even ignored. The IEE Wiring 
Regulations require that  ‘diagrams, charts, tables or equivalent 
forms of information are made available ’ to the installer and 
inspector and tester. 
 BS EN 60617 SYMBOLS 
BS EN 60617 gives the graphical symbols that should be used in 
all electrical/electronic diagrams or drawings. Since the symbols 
fall in line with the International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC) document 617, it should be possible to interpret non-UK 
diagrams. Samples of the symbols used in this book are shown in 
 Figure 1.1  .

 DIAGRAMS 
The four most commonly used diagrams are the block diagram, 
interconnection diagram, the circuit or schematic diagram and the 
wiring or connection diagram. 
 Block diagrams 
These diagrams indicate, by means of block symbols with suitable 
notes, the general way in which a system functions. They do not 
show detailed connections ( Figure 1.2a and b  ).

 Interconnection diagrams 
In this case, items of equipment may be shown in block form but 
with details of how the items are connected together ( Figure 1.3  ).

 Circuit or schematic diagrams 
These diagrams show how a system works, and need to pay no 
attention to the actual geographical layout of components or 
parts of components in that system. For example, a pair of con-
tacts which form part of, say, a timer may appear in a different and 
quite remote part of the diagram than the timer operating coil that 
actuates them. In this case some form of cross-reference scheme is 
needed (e.g. T for the timer coil and T1, T2, T3, etc. for the asso-
ciated contacts). 
It is usual for the sequence of events occurring in a system to be 
shown on a circuit diagram from left to right or from top to bot-
tom. For example, in  Figure 1.4  , nothing can operate until the 
main switch is closed, at which time the signal lamp comes on via 
the closed contacts of the push-button. When the push is operated 
the lamp goes out and the bell is energized via the push-button’s 
top pair of contacts. 
 Wiring or connection diagrams 
Here the diagrams show how a circuit is to be actually wired. 
Whenever possible, especially in the case of control panels, they 
should show components in their correct geographical locations.

The wiring between terminals may be shown individually on sim-
ple diagrams, but with complicated systems such wiring is shown 
in the form of thick lines with the terminating ends entering and 
leaving just as if the wiring were arranged in looms. Clearly,  Figure 
1.5a and b  are the wiring diagrams associated with the circuit 
shown in Figure 1.4 . Although Figure 1.5a  would be simple to wire 
without reference to the circuit diagram, Figure 1.5b  would present 
a problem as it is shown if Figure 1.4  were not available. 
In either case an alphanumeric (A1, GY56, f7, etc.) reference sys-
tem is highly desirable, not only for ease of initial wiring, but also 
for fault location or the addition of circuitry at a later date. Both 
circuit and wiring diagrams should be cross-referenced with such a 
system ( Figure 1.6a–c  ).
Note how, in  Figure 1.6c , each termination is referenced with the 
destination of the conductor connected to it. Also note how much 
more easily a circuit diagram makes the interpretation of the cir-
cuits function.  
 CIRCUIT CONVENTION 
It is probably sensible at this point to introduce the reader to 
circuit convention. This is simply a way of ensuring that circuit

diagrams are more easily interpreted, and is achieved by drawing 
such diagrams in a de-energized state known as normal . 
Hence, if we take a new motor starter out of its box, all of the 
coils, timers, overloads and contacts are said to be in their normal 
position. Figure 1.7a–d  (see page 10) illustrate this convention as 
applied to relays and contactors. 
Note that, provided diagrams follow this accepted convention, it 
is unnecessary to label contacts normally open (N/O) or normally 
closed (N/C).

 CONSTRUCTING AND INTERPRETING
CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS 
In order to construct or interpret a circuit/schematic diagram of the 
controls of a particular system, it is necessary to understand, in broad 
principles, how the system functions. A logical approach is needed, 
and it may take the novice some while before all  ‘clicks’ into place. 
 Here is an example to consider.

acquainted with electrical control systems you could arrange for 
these little luxuries to be automated as shown in Figure 1.8  .

FIGURE 1.8   Electronic valet.  
 The system components are as follows:
TC
Typical 24h   time clock: TC1 is set to close at 2100  h.
KS
Key switch operated by front door key: momentary action, contacts open 
when key is removed. 
T
Timer which can be set to close and open contacts T1 and T2 as required. 
DD
Drinks dispenser with a sprung platform on which the glass sits. When 
energized, DD will dispense a drink into the glass. 
When the glass is removed, the platform springs up closing contacts 1 and 
3 on DD1. 
DD1 Changeover contacts associated with DD.
FS Normally closed float switch, which opens when the correct bath water 
level is reached. 
 BFU (bath filling unit): electrically operated hot water valve. 
 Let us now follow the system through: 
 1.  At 9.00 pm or 2100   h the N/O contact TC1 on the time 
clock TC closes, giving supply to one side of the key switch 
and to the timer contact T1. 
 2.  You arrive home and open the door with the key, which 
closes the N/O spring-return contacts on KS, thus 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians

energizing the timer T. The drinks dispenser DD is also 
energized via its own N/C contacts DD1 (1 and 2). 
 3.  The timer T (now energized) instantly causes its own N/O 
contacts T1 to close, allowing supply to be maintained to
T and DD via T1 (this is called a ‘hold-on ’ circuit) when the 
key is removed from the key switch KS. N/O timer contacts 
T2 are set to close in say, 10   min. By the time you reach the 
lounge DD has poured your scotch. 
 4.  When you remove the glass from the dispenser, DD1 
contacts 1 and 2 open, and 1 and 3 close, de-energizing the 
dispenser and putting a supply to one side of the 10   min 
timed contacts T2. 
 5.  You can now sit down, relax and enjoy your drink, knowing 
that shortly, contacts T2 will close and energize the bath 
filling unit BFU via the N/C float switch FS. 
 6.  When the bath level is correct, the float switch FS 
opens and de-energizes BFU. You can now enjoy your 
bath.
 7.  One hour, say, after arriving home, the timer T will have 
completed its full cycle and reset, opening T1 and T2 and 
thus restoring the whole system to normal.  
This system is, of course, very crude. It will work but needs some 
refinement. What if you arrive home early – surely you need not 
stay dirty and thirsty? How do you take a bath during the day with-
out using the door key and having a drink? What about the bath 
water temperature? And so on. If you have already begun to think 
along these lines and can come up with simple solutions, then cir-
cuit/schematic diagrams should present no real problems to you. 
 Quiz controller 
Here is another system to consider. Can you draw a circuit/sche-
matic diagram for it? (A solution is given at the end of the book.) 

Diagrams

 The system function is as follows: 
 1.  Three contestants take part in a quiz show. Each has a 
push-to-make button and an indicator lamp. 
 2.  The quizmaster has a reset button that returns the system 
to normal. 
 3.  When a contestant pushes his/her button, the corresponding 
lamp is lit and stays lit. The other contestants ’ lamps will 
not light. 
 4.  The items of equipment are: a source of supply; a reset button 
(push-to-break); three push-to-make buttons; three relays 
each with 1 N/O and 2 N/C contacts and three signal lamps.  
The resulting diagram is a good illustration of the use of an alpha-
numeric system to show relay coils remote from their associated 
contacts.  
 HEATING AND VENTILATION SYSTEM 
 Figure 1.9  is part of a much larger schematic of the controls for the 
heating and ventilation system in a large hotel. 
From the diagram it is relatively simple to trace the series of events 
that occur in this section of the system. 
Clearly, there are four pumps: two boiler pumps and two variable 
temperature pumps. One of each of these pairs is a standby in the 
event of failure of the other; this will become clear as we interpret 
the scheme. 
There is a controller (similar to the programmer of a central heat-
ing system) which receives inputs from two temperature sensors 
and operates an actuator valve and a time switch. There are two 
sets of linked, three-position switches and direct-on-line three-
phase starters with single-phase coils S1/4, S2/4, S3/4 and S4/4 for 
the pumps. There is also run and trip indication for each pump.

 Let us now follow the sequence of events: 
 1.  The selector switches are set to, say, position 1. 
 2.  The temperature sensors operate and the controller actuates 
valve MV1. If the 24   V time switch relay R8/2 is energized, 
then its N/O contacts R8/2 are closed, giving supply to the 
selector switches. 
 3.  Starters S1/4 and S3/4 are energized via their respective 
overload (O/L) contacts; the main contacts close and the 
pumps start. Auxiliary contacts on the starters energize the 
run lamps. 
 4.  If pump 1, say, were to overload, then the N/O O/L contacts 
would close, de-energizing S1/4 and shutting down pump 1, 
and supply would be transferred to starter S2/4 for pump 2 
via the second linked switch. At the same time the trip 
lamp would come on and a supply via a diode and control 
cable C would be given to relay R9/1, operating its N/O 
contacts R9/1 to indicate a pump failure at a remote panel. 
The diode prevents back feeds to other trip lamps via the 
control cable C from other circuits. 
 5.  The reader will see that the same sequence of events would 
take place if the selector switch were in position 2 in the 
first place.  
 RELAY LOGIC 
In the last few pages we have investigated the use of relays for control 
purposes. Whilst this is perfectly acceptable for small applications, 
their use in more complex systems is now being superseded by pro-
grammable logic controllers (PLCs). However, before we discuss these 
in more detail, it is probably best to begin with a look at relay logic. 
We have already discussed circuit convention with regard to N/O 
and N/C contacts, and in the world of logic these contacts are 
referred to as  ‘gates’.

 AND gates 
If several N/O contacts are placed in series with, say, a lamp ( Figure 
1.10  ), it will be clear that contacts A and B and C must be closed 
in order for the lamp to light. These are known as AND gates. 
 OR gates 
If we now rewire these contacts in parallel ( Figure 1.11  ), they are 
converted to OR gates in that contact A or B or C will operate the 
lamp.
 Combined gates 
A combination of AND and OR systems is shown in Figure 1.12  , 
and would be typical of, say, a remote start/stop control circuit for 
a motor. A  or B or C will only operate the contactor coil if X and Y 
and Z are closed.

 FIGURE 1.13   
A simplification of any control system may be illustrated by a block 
diagram such as shown in Figure 1.13  , where the input may be 
achieved by the operation of a switch or sensor, the logic by relays, 
coils, timers, etc., and the outputs in the form of lamps, heaters, 
sounders, contactors, etc.  
 PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLERS 
With complex control requirements, the use of electro-mechanical 
relays is somewhat cumbersome, and most modern systems employ 
PLCs. In basic terms these do no more than relays (i.e. they process 
the input information and activate a corresponding output). Their 
great advantage, however, is in the use of microelectronics to achieve 
the same end. The saving in space and low failure rate (there are no 
moving parts) make them very desirable. A typical unit for, say, 20 
inputs (I) and 20 outputs (O), referred to as a 40 I/O unit, would 
measure approximately 300  mm by 100  mm by 100  mm, and would 
also incorporate counters, timers, internal coils, etc. 
A PLC is programmed to function in a specified way by the 
use of a keyboard and a display screen. The information may be 
programmed directly into the PLC, or a chip known as an EPROM

may be programmed remotely and then plugged into the PLC. The 
programming method uses ‘ladder logic ’. This employs certain 
symbols, examples of which are shown in Figure 1.14 . These sym-
bols appear on the screen as the ladder diagram is built up. 
 Here are some examples of the use of ladder logic.

 Motor control 
 Figure 1.15  illustrates a ladder logic diagram for a motor control 
circuit (no PLC involved here). Closing the N/O contacts X0 gives 
supply to the motor contactor coil Y0 via N/C stop buttons X1 and 
X2. Y0 is held on via its own N/O contact Y0 when X0 is released. 
The motor is stopped by releasing either X1 or X2. 
 Packing control 
 Figure 1.16  shows the basic parts of a packing process. An issuing 
machine ejects rubber balls into a delivery tube and thence into 
boxes on a turntable. A photoswitch senses each ball as it passes. 
Each box holds 10 balls and the turntable carries 10 boxes. 

Diagrams
19
Clearly, the issuing machine must be halted after the 10th ball, 
and time allowed for all balls to reach their box before the turn-
table revolves to bring another box into place. When the 10th box 
has been filled, the system must halt and a warning light must be 
energized to indicate that the process for that batch is completed. 
When new boxes are in place the system is restarted by operating 
an N/C manual reset button. 
This system is ideal for control by a PLC with its integral counters 
and timers. Figure 1.17  shows an example of the ladder logic for 
this system using the following:
X0
N/O photocell switch: closes as ball passes.

 Fault location 
Another major advantage of the use of PLCs for controlling sys-
tems is the relative ease of fault location. In the event of system 
failure, the keyboard and screen unit is plugged into the PLC and 
the condition of the system is displayed in ladder logic on the 
screen. Then, for example, any contact that is in the wrong pos-
ition will show up.  
 DRAWING EXERCISES  
 1.  Using BS EN 60617 architectural symbols, draw  block 
diagrams of the following circuits: 
 (a)   A lighting circuit controlled by one switch, protected 
by a fuse, and comprising three tungsten filament lamp 
points, two double fluorescent luminaires, and one 
single fluorescent luminaire. 
 (b)   A lighting circuit controlled by two-way switches, 
protected by a fuse, and comprising three floodlights. 
 (c)   A lighting circuit controlled by two-way switches, and 
one intermediate switch, protected by a circuit breaker, 
and comprising three spotlights. One of the two-way 
switches is to be cord operated. 
 (d)   A ring final circuit protected by a circuit breaker, and 
comprising six double switched socket outlets and two 
single switched socket outlets.  
 2.  Replace the symbols shown in  Figure 1.18  with the correct 
BS EN 60617 symbols.  
 Solutions are given at the end of the book.

 Wiring Systems  
In this chapter we will investigate a selection of the many wiring 
systems employed in modern installations. Some of these systems 
are simple to understand and require little explanation. Others of a 
more complex nature should now, in the light of the reader’s new-
found knowledge of diagrams, etc., present only minor problems of 
interpretation.
It should be noted that diagrams for LV systems rarely indicate 
conductor colours, it is more likely that control circuit and ELV 
system diagrams will show these. Table 2.1  shows the colours/
alphanumeric references required by the IEE Wiring Regulations.

 RADIAL SYSTEMS 
Any system which starts from the supply point and either radi-
ates out like the spokes of a wheel, or extends from one point to 
another in the form of a chain, is a radial system.   Figures 2.1, 2.2 
and 2.3  illustrate such systems as applied to lighting and power 
circuits.

It should be noted that BS EN 60617 architectural symbols are not 
often shown in this fashion; it is usual to see them used in con-
junction with building plans. This will be discussed later. 
 RING CIRCUITS 
These circuits start at the supply point, loop from point to point 
and return to the same terminals they started from. They are most 
popular in domestic premises, where they are referred to as ring 
final circuits. 
However, such systems are also used in factories where overhead 
busbar trunking is in the form of a ring, or for supply authority 
networks (  Figures 2.4 and 2.5  ).
 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS 
Such systems are many and varied, but they are quite simple to 
understand as they tend to follow the ring and radial concepts.

 FIGURE 2.5   Layout of industrial installation.  
Take, for example, the UK electricity system. Regardless of who 
owns this or that part of it, the system functions in the follow-
ing stages: generation, transmission and distribution. Generated 
electricity is transmitted over vast distances around the United 
Kingdom in a combination of ring and radial circuits to points of 
utilization, where it is purchased by the distribution network oper-
ators (DNOs) and distributed to their customers. Once again these 
systems are in ring or radial forms. 
Probably more familiar to the installation electrician is the distri-
bution system in an industrial or commercial environment. Here 
one finds radial circuits originating from the intake position and 
feeding distribution boards (DBs), from which are fed either more

DBs or final circuits. Diagrams for such systems may be of the 
block type ( Figure 2.6  ) or of the interconnection type ( Figure 2.7  ).
Note how much more detail there is on the section of the drawing 
shown in Figure 2.7 . Cable sizes and types are shown, together with 
cable lengths (23, 26  m, etc.). Details at each DB indicate current 
loading (CC), approximate maximum demand (AMD), voltage drop 
(VD), earth loop impedance (ELI) and prospective fault current (PFC).  
With the larger types of installation, an alphanumeric system is 
very useful for cross-reference between block diagrams and floor 
plans showing architectural symbols. Figure 2.8  (see page 30) 
shows such a system.

floor plan shows which circuits are fed from DB3, and the number 
and phase colour of the protection. For example, the fluorescent light-
ing in the main entrance hall is fed from protective device number 
1 on the grey phase of DB3/Gr1, and is therefore marked DB3/Br1. 
Similarly, the water heater circuit in the female toilets is fed from 
protective device number 2 on the black phase (i.e. DB3/Bk2).

 EMERGENCY LIGHTING SYSTEMS 
These fall into two categories: maintained and non-maintained. 
Both these systems may be utilized by individual units or by a cen-
tralized source. 
 Maintained system 
In this system the emergency lighting unit is energized continu-
ously via a step-down transformer, and in the event of a mains fail-
ure it remains illuminated via a battery ( Figure 2.13, see page 35  ).
 Non-maintained system 
Here the lighting units remain de-energized until a mains failure 
occurs, at which time they are illuminated by a battery supply 
(Figure 2.14, see page 35  ).

It should be noted that modern systems use electronic means to 
provide the change-over from mains to battery supply. The contac-
tor method, however, serves to illustrate the principle of operation.  
 SECURITY AND FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS 
As with emergency lighting, modern security and fire alarm sys-
tems are electronically controlled, and it is not the brief of this 
book to investigate electronic circuitry. However, as with the pre-
vious section, the basic principle of operation can be shown by 
electro-mechanical means. 
Both security and fire alarm systems are basically the same in that 
various sensors are wired to a control panel, which in turn will 
activate an alarm in the event of sensor detection (  Figures 2.15 
and 2.16  ). Some modern panels have the facility for incorporating 
both systems in the same enclosure. 
 The principles of operation are as follows. 
 Open-circuit system 
In this system the call points (sensors, detectors, etc.) are wired 
in parallel such that the operation of any one will give supply to 
the relay RA and the sounder via the reset button ( Figure 2.17  ).
N/O contacts RA1 will then close, holding on the relay and keep-
ing to the sounder via these contacts. This hold-on facility is most

important as it ensures that the sounder is not interrupted if any 
attempt is made to return the activated call point to its original off 
position.
Fire alarm systems are usually wired on an open circuit basis, with 
a two-wire system looped from one detector to the next, terminat-
ing across an end-of-line resistor (EOLR). This provides a circuit 
cable monitoring facility; the EOLR is of sufficiently high value 
to prevent operation of the alarm.  Figure 2.18  shows a typical 
connection diagram. 
 Closed-circuit system 
This system has the call points wired in series, and the operation 
of the reset button energizes the relay RA ( Figure 2.19  ). Normally

open (N/O) contacts RA1 close and normally closed (N/C) contacts 
RA2 open, the relay remaining energized via contacts RA1 when 
the reset button is released. The alarm sounder mute switch is 
then closed, and the whole system is now set up. 
An interruption of the supply to relay RA, by operation of any call 
point, will de-energize the relay, open RA1 and close RA2, thus 
actuating the alarm sounder. The system can only be cancelled 
and reset by use of the reset button. 
The closed system is quite popular, as it is self-monitoring in that 
any malfunction of the relay or break in the call point wiring will 
cause operation of the system as if a call point had been activated.

Intruder alarm systems tend, in the main, to be based on the 
closed-circuit type. Figure 2.20  shows the connection diagram for 
a simple two-zone system with tamper loop and personal attack 
button.
The tamper loop is simply a continuous conductor wired to a ter-
minal in each detector in the system. It is continuously monitored 
irrespective of whether the alarm system is switched on or off, and 
if interrupted will cause immediate operation of the alarm.

The entry/exit circuit is usually confined to the front and/or back 
doors. The facility exists to alter the time delay between setting 
the system and exiting, and between entering and switching the 
system off. This adjustment is made inside the control panel. 
All security and fire alarm systems should have battery back-up 
with charging facilities. 
Both fire and emergency lighting systems are Safety Services 
and are dealt with, generally, in Chapter 56 of the IEE Wiring 
Regulations. More detailed requirements are to be found in BS 
5266 for emergency lighting and BS 5839 for fire protection.  
 CALL SYSTEMS 
Once again these fall into different categories, such as telephone 
systems and page and bleeper systems. However, the typical nurse-
call variety, which uses push-buttons and lamp indication, is prob-
ably the most popular. 
With this type, each room is equipped with a call button of some 
description, a patient’s reassurance light and a cancel button. Outside 
each room is an indicator light, and at strategic points in the building 
are zone sounders. Centrally located is a display panel which incor-
porates a sounder and an indication of which room is calling. 
 Figure 2.21  illustrates, in a simple form, the principle of operation 
of such a system. This system should, by now, be quite familiar 
to the reader; it is simply another variation of the hold-on circuit. 
Any patient pushing a call button energizes the corresponding 
relay in the main control panel, which is held on by a pair of N/O 
contacts. At the same time the reassurance, room and panel lights 
1, 2 and 3 are all illuminated. The zone and panel sounders are 
energized via the relay’s other pair of N/O contacts.

It is usual to locate cancel buttons in patient’s rooms only, as this 
ensures that staff visit the patient in question. 
All of the systems just dealt with are generally supplied from an 
extra low-voltage (ELV) source and are known as Band I circuits. 
These should not be contained within the same wiring system as

 MOTOR STARTER CIRCUITS 
No book on wiring systems would be complete without reference 
to control circuits for motor starters. Here we will look at direct-
on-line (DOL) and star-delta starters. Once more, the good old 
hold-on circuit is employed in both types. 
 Direct-on-line starter 
Both single- and three-phase types use the same circuit, as illus-
trated in   Figures 2.22 and 2.23  . It is important to note that if a 
230 V coil were to be used instead of a 400  V type, the coil connec-
tions would require a neutral conductor in the starter.

 Star-delta starter 
 Figures 2.24 and 2.25  show the wiring and schematic diagrams for 
a star-delta starter. This is clearly a more complicated system than 
the DOL type. However, the control system is essentially the same. 
On start-up, the star contactor, electronic timer and the main con-
tactor are all energized. At the end of the set time the supply to 
the star contactor is removed and given to the delta contactor, the 
main contactor remaining energized the whole time. Reference to 
 Figure 2.25  will indicate how the system functions.

 CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEMS 
It would be impossible in such a small book to deal with the vast 
number of modern systems and variations that are currently avail-
able. We will therefore take a look at the two most basic arrange-
ments: the pumped central heating (CH) and gravity-fed hot water 
(HW) system, and the fully pumped system with mid-position 
valve. It must be remembered that, whatever the system, it is 
imperative that the wiring installer has a knowledge of the func-
tion of the system in order for him/her to do a competent job. 
 Pumped CH and gravity HW 
This system comprises a boiler with its own thermostat to regu-
late the water temperature, a pump, a hot water storage tank, a 
room thermostat and some form of timed programmer. The water 
for the HW (i.e. the taps, etc.) is separate from the CH water, but 
the boiler heats both systems. 
 Figure 2.26  shows such a system. From the diagram it might 
appear that when the requirement for HW is switched off at the 
programmer, the CH cannot be called for as the boiler has lost 
its feed. In fact, such programmers have a mechanical linkage 
between the switches: HW is allowed without CH, but selection of 
CH automatically selects HW also. 
Note the little heating element in the room thermostat; this is 
known as an accelerator. Its purpose is to increase the sensitivity 
of the thermostat; manufacturers claim that it increases the accur-
acy of the unit to within one degree Celsius. The inclusion of an

Two additional items are required for this system: a cylinder thermo-
stat and a mid-position valve. In this system HW and CH can be 
selected independently. The mid-position valve has three ports: a 
motor will drive the valve to either HW only, CH only or HW and 
CH combined. With this system the boiler and pump always work 
together.  Figure 2.27 illustrates the system, and Figure 2.28  (see 
page 49) shows the internal connections of a mid-position valve.

halogen dichroic lamps, which have a very high performance 
in comparison with 240  V halogen lamps. For example, a 50  W 
dichroic lamp has the same intensity as a 150   W PAR lamp. 
Extra low-voltage (ELV) lighting is becoming very popular, espe-
cially for display purposes. There is very little heat emission, the 
colour rendering is excellent and energy consumption is very low. 
The 12  V AC to supply the lamps is derived from a 230   V/12   V 
transformer specially designed to cater for the high starting surges, 
and only these types should be used. The voltage at each lamp is 
critical: 0.7  V overvoltage can cause premature ageing of the lamp, 
and 0.7  V undervoltage will reduce the light output by 30 per cent. 
Hence the variation in voltage must be avoided. 
To achieve this, leads and cables must be kept as short as pos-sible, 
and the correct size used to avoid excessive voltage drop. When 
several lamps are to be run from one transformer, it is advisable 
to use a fused splitter unit rather than to wire them in a parallel 
chain ( Figure 2.29  ).

It is important to remember that, for example, a 50  W ELV lamp 
will draw 4.17  A from the 12  V secondary of the transformer 
(I    P / V). Although a 1.0   mm 2 cable will carry the current, the 
voltage drop for only 3   m of this cable will be 0.55  V.

 DOMESTIC TELEPHONE SYSTEMS 
Extensions to domestic telephone systems are extremely easy 
as each extension socket is wired in parallel to the one previous 
(Figure 2.30  ).
Master
Secondary sockets
 FIGURE 2.30   Telephone system block diagram.  
The master socket is the first socket in any installation and con-
tains components to allow telephones to 
■  be removed without causing problems at the exchange 
 ■  stop surges on the line such as lightning strikes 
 ■  prevent the telephone making partial ringing noises when 
dialling.  
Connection to the master socket is not permitted, except by use of 
an adaptor plug and extension cable. 
 Extension or secondary sockets house only terminals. 
 Secondary sockets 
The number of these is unlimited but the number of modern 
telephones or ringing devices (e.g. extension bells) connected at 
any one time is limited to four. More than this and telephones 
may not ring or even work. 
 Cable 
The cable used should comply with BT specification CW1308, 
which is 1/0.5  mm and ranges from four-core (two pairs) to 40-core 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
52
(20 pairs). It is not usual for secondary sockets to require any more 
than four cores. 
 Wiring 
Wiring may be flush or surface but kept clear of the low-voltage 
electrical system by at least 50  mm. No more than 100  m of cable 
should be used overall and the length between the master socket 
and the first extension socket should not be more than 50  m.
Connection to the modern insulation displacement connectors 
(IDCs) is made using a special tool provided with each socket. The 
connection requirements are as shown in Figure 2.31  .

 Testing and Test Instruments  
Whilst this section deals with testing, it should be remembered 
that such action should always be preceded by inspection as this 
may reveal faults, damage, deterioration, etc., that cannot be 
detected by testing alone. 
 MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL QUANTITIES  
As the reader will know, the basic electrical quantities which need 
to be measured in the world of the installation electrician are cur-
rent, voltage and resistance. The units of these quantities are the 
ampere, the volt and the ohm, respectively. 
Paradoxically, however, the range and complexity of the instru-
ments available to measure these three fundamental quantities are 
enormous. So where does one start in order to make a choice of 
the most suitable types? 
Let us look at the range of quantities that an electrician is likely to 
encounter in the normal practice of his/her profession. If we take 
the sequence of the more commonly used tests prescribed by the 
IEE Wiring Regulations, and assign typical values to them, we can 
at least provide a basis for the choice of the most suitable instru-
ments. It will be seen from Table 3.1  that all that is required is an 
ohmmeter of one sort or another, a residual current device (RCD) 
tester and an instrument for measuring prospective fault current 
(PFC).
CHAPTER 3 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
54
 SELECTION OF TEST INSTRUMENTS 
It is clearly most sensible to purchase instruments from one of the 
established manufacturers rather than to attempt to save money 
by buying cheaper, lesser known brands. Also, as the instruments 
used in the world of installation are bound to be subjected to harsh 
treatment, a robust construction is all important. Reference should 
be made to the HSE Guidance Note GS38 ‘Electrical test equip-
ment for use by electricians ’.
Many of the well-known instrument companies provide a dual 
facility in one instrument, for example PFC and loop impedance, 
or insulation resistance and continuity. Hence it is likely that only 
one, three or four instruments would be needed, together with an 
approved test lamp (a subject to be dealt with in the next section). 
Now, which type to choose, analogue or digital? There are merits 
in both varieties, and the choice should not be determined just by 
expense or a reluctance to use ‘new-fangled electronic gadgetry ’!
This attitude has, however, become a thing of the past, and an

analogue variety would probably only be purchased second hand! 
Accuracy, ease of use and robustness, together with personal pref-
erence, are the all-important considerations. 
 APPROVED TEST LAMPS AND VOLTAGE INDICATORS 
Search your tool boxes; find, with little difficulty one would sus-
pect, your ‘neon screwdriver ’ or ‘testascope’; locate a very deep 
pond; and drop it in! 
Imagine actually allowing electric current at low voltage (50–1000   V 
AC) to pass through one’s body in order to activate a test lamp! It 
only takes around 10–15  mA to cause severe electric shock, and 
50  mA (1/20th of an ampere) to kill. 
Apart from the fact that such a device will register any voltage 
from about 5  V upwards, the safety of the user depends entirely on 
the integrity of the current-limiting resistor in the unit. An electri-
cian received a considerable shock when using such an instrument 
after his apprentice had dropped it in a sink of water, simply wiped 
it dry and replaced it in the tool box. The water had seeped into 
the device and shorted out the resistor. 
It should be said, however, that some modern types are available 
that are proximity devices and can give an indication of the pres-
ence of voltage. Such a device should never be relied on to suggest 
that a circuit is dead and safe to work on. It could be useful to 
indicate if a fuse had operated by placing it either side. 
An approved test lamp should be of similar construction to that 
shown in Figure 3.1  . 
 ACCIDENTAL RCD OPERATION 
It has long been the practice when using a test lamp to probe 
between line and earth for indication of a live supply on the line 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians

terminal. However, this can now prevent a problem where RCDs 
exist in the circuit, as of course the test is applying a deliberate 
line to earth fault. 
Some test lamps have LED indicators, and the internal circuitry of 
such test lamps limits the current to earth to a level below that at 
which RCD will operate. The same limiting effect applies to mul-
timeters. However, it is always best to check that the testing device 
will have no effect on RCDs. 
 CALIBRATION, ZEROING AND CARE OF 
INSTRUMENTS
Precise calibration of instruments is usually well outside the prov-
ince of the electrician, and would normally be carried out by the 
manufacturer or a local service representative. A check, however,

can be made by the user to determine whether calibration is neces-
sary by comparing readings with an instrument known to be accu-
rate, or by measurement of known values of voltage, resistance, 
etc., available on units now on the market and advertised as  ‘check
boxes’.
It may be the case that readings are incorrect simply because the 
instrument is not zeroed or nulled before use, or because the internal
battery needs replacing. Most modern instruments have battery 
condition indication, and of course this should never be ignored. 
Always adjust any selection switches to the off position after test-
ing. Too many instrument fuses are blown when, for example, a 
multimeter is inadvertently left on the ohms range and then used 
to check for mains voltage. 
The following procedure may seem rather basic but should ensure 
trouble-free testing: 
 1.  Check test leads for obvious defects. 
 2.  Zero/null the instrument (where required). 
 3.  Select the correct range for the values anticipated. If in 
doubt, choose the highest range and gradually drop down. 
 4.  Make a record of test results, if necessary. 
 5.  Return switches/selectors to the off position. 
 6.  Replace instrument leads in carrying case.  
 CONTINUITY OF PROTECTIVE CONDUCTORS 
All protective conductors, including main protective and supple-
mentary bonding conductors must be tested for continuity using a 
low-resistance ohmmeter. 
For main protective bonding there is no single fixed value of resist-
ance above which the conductor would be deemed unsuitable. 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
58
Each measured value, if indeed it is measurable for very short 
lengths, should be compared with the relevant value for a particu-
lar conductor length and size. Such values are shown in Table 3.2  .

Where a supplementary bonding conductor has been installed 
between simultaneously accessible exposed and extraneous con-
ductive parts, because circuit disconnection times cannot be met, 
then the resistance ( R) of the conductor, must be equal to or less 
than 50/ Ia. So, R    50/ Ia, where 50 is the voltage above which 
exposed metalwork should not rise, and Ia is the minimum cur-
rent causing operation of the circuit protective device within 5   s. 
For example, suppose a 45  A BS 3036 fuse protects a cooker cir-
cuit, the disconnection time for the circuit cannot be met, and so a 
supplementary bonding conductor has been installed between the 
cooker case and an adjacent central heating radiator. The resistance 
(R) of that conductor should not be greater than 50/ Ia, and Ia in this 
case is 145  A (see Figure 3.2B of the IEE Regulations), that is

How then do we conduct a test to establish continuity of main

Testing and Test Instruments

really, just connect the leads from a low-resistance ohmmeter to 
the ends of the bonding conductor ( Figure 3.2  ). One end should be 
disconnected from its bonding clamp, otherwise any measurement 
may include the resistance of parallel paths of other earthed metal-
work. Remember to zero or null the instrument or, if this facility 
is not available, record the resistance of the test leads so that this 
value can be subtracted from the test reading.

Important Note
If the installation is in operation, then never disconnect main protective bonding con-
ductors unless the supply can be isolated. Without isolation, persons and livestock are 
at risk of electric shock.
The continuity of circuit protective conductors (cpc ’s) may be 
established in the same way, but a second method is preferred, as 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
60
the results of this second test indicate the value of ( R 1    R 2) for the
circuit in question. 
 The test is conducted in the following manner: 
 1.  Temporarily link together the line conductor and cpc of the 
circuit concerned in the distribution board or consumer 
unit.
 2.  Test between line and cpc at  each outlet in the circuit. A 
reading indicates continuity. 
 3.  Record the test result obtained at the furthest point in the 
circuit. This value is ( R 1    R 2 ) for the circuit.  
 Figure 3.3  illustrates the above method. There may be some dif-
ficulty in determining the ( R 1    R 2) values of circuits in installa-
tions that comprise steel conduit and trunking, and/or SWA and 
MI cables because of the parallel earth paths that are likely to 
exist. In these cases, continuity tests may have to be carried out at 
the installation stage before accessories are connected or termin-
ations made off as well as after completion.

Although it is no longer considered good working practice to use 
steel conduit or trunking as a protective conductor, it is permitted, 
and hence its continuity must be proved. The enclosure must be 
inspected along its length to ensure that it is sound and then the 
standard low-resistance test is performed. 
CONTINUITY OF RING FINAL CIRCUIT CONDUCTORS 
 There are two main reasons for conducting this test: 
 1.  To establish that interconnections in the ring do not exist. 
 2.  To ensure that the cpc is continuous, and indicate the value 
of ( R 1    R 2 ) for the ring.  
What then are interconnections in a ring circuit, and why is it 
important to locate them? Figure 3.4  shows a ring final circuit 
with an interconnection.

The most likely cause of the situation shown in  Figure 3.4  is 
where a DIY enthusiast has added sockets P, Q, R and S to an 
existing ring A, B, C, D, E and F. 
In itself there is nothing wrong with this. The problem arises if 
a break occurs at, say, point Y, or the terminations fail in socket 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
62
C or P. Then there would be four sockets all fed from the point X 
which would then become a spur. 
So, how do we identify such a situation with or without breaks at 
point ‘Y’? A simple resistance test between the ends of the line, 
neutral or cpc ’s will only indicate that a circuit exists, whether 
there are interconnections or not. The following test method is 
based on the philosophy that the resistance measured across any 
diameter of a perfect circle of conductor will always be the same 
value ( Figure 3.5  ). 
Circle of
conductor
Same value whatever
diameter is measured

 FIGURE 3.5   
The perfect circle of conductor is achieved by cross connecting the 
line and neutral legs of the ring ( Figure 3.6  ).
 The test procedure is as follows: 
 1.  Identify the opposite legs of the ring. This is quite easy 
with sheathed cables, but with singles, each conductor 
will have to be identified, probably by taking resistance 
measurements between each one and the closest socket 
outlet. This will give three high readings and three low 
readings thus establishing the opposite legs. 

Testing and Test Instruments
63
 2.  Take a resistance measurement between the ends of each 
conductor loop. Record this value. 
 3.  Cross connect the opposite ends of the line and neutral 
loops ( Figure 3.7  ).
 4.  Measure between line and neutral at each socket on the 
ring. The readings obtained should be, for a perfect ring, 
substantially the same. If an interconnection existed such 
as shown in Figure 3.4 , then sockets A to F would all have 
similar readings, and those beyond the interconnection 
would have gradually increasing values to approximately the 
mid point of the ring, then decreasing values back towards 
the interconnection. If a break had occurred at point Y then 
the readings from socket S would increase to a maximum 
at socket P. One or two high readings are likely to indicate 
either loose connections or spurs. A null reading (i.e. an 
open-circuit indication) is probably a reverse polarity, either 
line- or neutral-cpc reversal. These faults would clearly be 
rectified and the test at the suspect socket(s) repeated. 
 5.  Repeat the above procedure, but in this case cross connect 
the line and cpc loops ( Figure 3.8  ).

In this instance, if the cable is of the flat twin type, the readings 
at each socket will increase very slightly and then decrease around 
the ring. This difference, due to the line and cpc being different 
sizes, will not be significant enough to cause any concern. The 
measured value is very important, it is  R 1     R 2 for the ring. 
As before, loose connections, spurs and, in this case, L–N cross 
polarity will be picked up. 
The details in Table 3.3  are typical approximate ohmic values for 
a healthy 70  m ring final circuit wired in 2.5/1.5 flat twin and cpc 
cable. (In this case the cpc will be approximately 1.67     the L or 
N resistance.)

As already mentioned, null readings may indicate a reverse polarity. 
They could also indicate twisted conductors not in their terminal 
housing. The examples shown in Figure 3.9  may help to explain 
these situations.

 INSULATION RESISTANCE 
This is probably the most used and yet abused test of them all. 
Affectionately known as  ‘meggering’, an insulation resistance test 
is performed in order to ensure that the insulation of conductors, 
accessories and equipment is in a healthy condition, and will prevent 
dangerous leakage currents between conductors and between con-
ductors and earth. It also indicates whether any short circuits exist. 
Insulation resistance, as just discussed, is the resistance measured 
between conductors and is made up of countless millions of resist-
ances in parallel ( Figure 3.10  ). 
The more resistances there are in parallel, the lower the overall 
resistance, and in consequence, the longer a cable, the lower the 
insulation resistance. Add to this the fact that almost all instal-
lation circuits are also wired in parallel, and it becomes apparent 
that tests on large installations may give, if measured as a whole, 
pessimistically low values, even if there are no faults. 
Under these circumstances, it is usual to break down such large 
installations into smaller sections, floor by floor, distribution cir-
cuit (submain), etc. This also helps, in the case of periodic testing, 
to minimize disruption. The test procedure is as follows: 
 1.  Disconnect all items of equipment such as capacitors 
and indicator lamps as these are likely to give misleading 
results. Remove any items of equipment likely to be 
damaged by the test, such as dimmer switches, electronic 
timers, etc. Remove all lamps and accessories and 

Testing and Test Instruments
67
disconnect fluorescent and discharge fittings. Ensure that 
the installation is disconnected from the supply, all fuses 
are in place, and circuit breakers and switches are in the 
on position. In some instances it may be impracticable 
to remove lamps, etc., and in this case the local switch 
controlling such equipment may be left in the off position. 
 2.  Join together all live conductors of the supply and test 
between this join and earth. Alternatively, test between each 
live conductor and earth in turn. 
 3.  Test between line and neutral. For three-phase systems, join 
together all lines and test between this join and neutral.

 FIGURE 3.10   Resistance of insulation.

68
Then test between each of the lines. Alternatively, test 
between each of the live conductors in turn. Installations 
incorporating two-way lighting systems should be tested 
twice with the two-way switches in alternative positions.  
 Table 3.4  gives the test voltages and minimum values of insulation 
resistance for ELV and LV systems.

 Over 500 V

 1.0   M Ω 
If a value of less than 2   M Ω is recorded it may indicate a situation 
where a fault is developing, but as yet still complies with the mini-
mum permissible value. In this case each circuit should be tested 
separately to find the faulty circuit. 
Where electronic devices cannot be disconnected, test only between 
line and neutral connected together and protective earth. 
 Example 3.1 
An installation comprises six circuits with individual insulation resistances of 2.5, 8, 
200, 200, 200 and 200   M Ω , and so the total insulation resistance will be:

This is clearly greater than the 1   M Ω minimum but less than 2   M Ω, and so an investi-

 POLARITY 
This simple test, often overlooked, is just as important as all the 
others, and many serious injuries and electrocutions could have 
been prevented if only polarity checks had been carried out. 
 The requirements are: 
 1.  All fuses and single pole switches are in the line conductor. 
 2.  The centre contact of an Edison screw type lampholder 
is connected to the line conductor (except E 14 and E 27, 
which are new types with an insulating thread material). 
 3.  All socket outlets and similar accessories are correctly 
wired.  
Although polarity is towards the end of the recommended test 
sequence, it would seem sensible, on lighting circuits, for example, 
to conduct this test at the same time as that for continuity of cpcs 
(Figure 3.11  ).

 FIGURE 3.11   Lighting polarity.  
As discussed earlier, polarity on ring final circuit conductors 
is achieved simply by conducting the ring circuit test. For radial 
socket-outlet circuits, however, this is a little more difficult. The 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
70
continuity of the cpc will have already been proved by linking line 
and cpc and measuring between the same terminals at each socket. 
Whilst a line–cpc reversal would not have shown, a line–neutral 
reversal would, as there would have been no reading at the socket 
in question. This would have been remedied, and so only line–
cpc reversals need to be checked. This can be done by linking 
together line and neutral at the origin and testing between the 
same terminals at each socket. A line–cpc reversal will result in no 
reading at the socket in question. 
When the supply is connected, it is important to check that the 
incoming supply is correct. This is done using an approved voltage 
indicator at the intake position or close to it. In the case of a three 
phase supply a phase sequence indicator would be used. 
 EARTH FAULT LOOP IMPEDANCE 
This is very important but, sadly, poorly understood. So let us 
remind ourselves of the component parts of the earth fault loop 
path ( Figure 3.12  ). Starting at the point of fault: 
 1.  The cpc. 
 2.  The earthing conductor and earthing terminal. 
 3.  The return path via the earth for TT systems, and the 
metallic return path in the case of TN-S or TN-C-S 
systems. In the latter case the metallic return is the PEN 
conductor. 
 4.  The earthed neutral of the supply transformer. 
 5.  The transformer winding. 
 6.  The line conductor back to the point of fault.  
Overcurrent protective devices must, under earth fault conditions, 
disconnect fast enough to reduce the risk of electric shock. This is 
achieved if the actual value of the earth fault loop impedance does not 
exceed the tabulated maximum values given in the IEE Regulations. 

Testing and Test Instruments
71
The purpose of the test, therefore, is to determine the actual value 
of the loop impedance ( Z s), for comparison with those maximum 
values, and it is conducted as follows: 
 1.  Ensure that all main protective bonding conductors are in 
place.
 2.  Connect the test instrument either by its BS 1363 plug, or 
the ‘flying leads ’, to the line, neutral and earth terminals at 
the remote end of the circuit under test. (If a neutral is not 
available, e.g. in the case of a three-phase motor, connect 
the neutral probe to earth.) 
 3.  Press to test and record the value indicated.

It must be understood that this instrument reading is  not valid for 
direct comparison with the tabulated maximum values, as account 
must be taken of the ambient temperature at the time of test, and 
the maximum conductor operating temperature, both of which 
will have an effect on conductor resistance. Hence, the ( R 1    R 2 ) 
could be greater at the time of fault than at the time of test. 
So, our measured value of Z s must be corrected to allow for these 
possible increases in temperature occurring at a later date. This 
requires actually measuring the ambient temperature and applying 
factors in a formula. 
Clearly, this method of correcting  Z s is time consuming and 
unlikely to be commonly used. Hence, a rule of thumb method 
may be applied which simply requires that the measured value of 
Z s does not exceed 0.8 of the appropriate tabulated value. Table 3.5  
gives the 0.8 values of tabulated loop impedance for direct compari-
son with measured values. 
In effect, a loop impedance test places a line/earth fault on the 
installation, and if an RCD is present it may not be possible to 
conduct the test as the device will trip out each time the loop 
impedance tester button is pressed. Unless the instrument is of 
a type that has a built-in guard against such tripping, the value 
of Z s will have to be determined from measured values of  Z e and 
(R 1    R 2 ), and the 0.8 rule applied. 
Important Note
 Never short out an RCD in order to conduct this test. 
As a loop impedance test creates a high earth fault current, albeit 
for a short space of time, some lower rated circuit breakers may 
operate, resulting in the same situation as with an RCD, and  Z s

will have to be calculated. It is not really good practice temporarily 
to replace the circuit breaker with one of a higher rating. 
 External loop impedance Ze
The value of Z e is measured at the intake position on the sup-
ply side and with all main protective bonding conductors discon-
nected. Unless the installation can be isolated from the supply, 
this test should not be carried out, as a potential shock risk will 
exist with the supply on and the main bonding disconnected. 
 Prospective fault current 
This would normally be carried out at the same time as the meas-
urement for Z e using a PFC or PSCC (prospective short-circuit 
current) tester. If this value cannot be measured it must be ascer-
tained by either enquiry or calculation. 
Be sure to follow the instrument manufacturers ’ instructions. 
Measure Ipf line to neutral, if three leads, place N/protective con-
ductors on neutral bar (for typical instruments). Record highest 
reading and determine a value for three phase where Ipf (short 
circuit current) is approximately 2     single-phase value.  
 EARTH ELECTRODE RESISTANCE 
In many rural areas, the supply system is TT and hence reliance is 
placed on the general mass of earth for a return path under earth 
fault conditions. Connection to earth is made by an electrode, usu-
ally of the rod type, and preferably installed as shown in Figure 3.13  . 
In order to determine the resistance of the earth return path, it 
is necessary to measure the resistance that the electrode has with

earth. If we were to make such measurements at increasingly 
longer distances from the electrode, we would notice an increase 
in resistance up to about 2.5–3  m from the rod, after which no fur-
ther increase in resistance would be noticed ( Figure 3.14  ).
The maximum resistance recorded is the electrode resistance and 
the area that extends the 2.5–3  m beyond the electrode is known 
as the earth electrode resistance area. 
There are two methods of making the measurement, one using a 
proprietary instrument and the other using a loop impedance tester. 
 Method 1: Usually where no AC supply is available 
This method is based on the principle of the potential divider 
(Figure 3.15  ).

By varying the position of the slider the resistance at any point 
may be calculated from R    V / I . 
The earth electrode resistance test is conducted in a similar fashion, 
with the earth replacing the resistance and a potential electrode 
replacing the slider ( Figure 3.16  ). In Figure 3.16  the earthing con-
ductor to the electrode under test is temporarily disconnected.

 The method of test is as follows: 
 1.  Place the current electrode (C2) away from the electrode 
under test, approximately 10 times its length (i.e. 30   m for a 
3 m rod). 
 2.  Place the potential electrode mid way. 
 3.  Connect test instrument as shown. 
 4.  Record resistance value. 
 5.  Move the potential electrode approximately 3   m either side 
of the mid position, and record these two readings. 
 6.  Take an average of these three readings (this is the earth 
electrode resistance). 
 7.  Determine the maximum deviation or difference of this 
average from the three readings. 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
78
 8.  Express this deviation as a percentage of the average 
reading.
 9.  Multiply this percentage deviation by 1.2. 
 10.  Provided this value does not exceed a figure of 5% then the 
accuracy of the measurement is considered acceptable.

were 181, 185 and 179   Ω, what is the value of the electrode resist-
ance and is the accuracy of the measurement acceptable?

 Method 2: For TT systems protected by an RCD 
In this case, an earth fault loop impedance test is carried out 
between the incoming line terminal and the electrode (a standard 
test for Z e ). 
The value obtained is added to the cpc resistance of the protected 
circuits and this value is multiplied by the operating current of the 
RCD. The resulting value should not exceed 50  V. If it does, then 
Method 1 should be used to check the actual value of the electrode 
resistance.

 FUNCTIONAL TESTING  
 RCD/RCBO operation 
Where RCDs/RCBOs are fitted, it is essential that they operate 
within set parameters. The RCD testers used are designed to do 
just this, and the basic tests required are as follows: 
 1.  Set the test instrument to the rating of the RCD. 
 2.  Set the test instrument to half rated trip. 
 3.  Operate the instrument and the RCD should not trip. 
 4.  Set the instrument to deliver the full rated tripping current 
of the RCD. 
 5.  Operate the instrument and the RCD should trip out in the 
required time.  
There seems to be a popular misconception regarding the ratings 
and uses of RCDs in that they are the panacea for all electrical ills 
and the only useful rating is 30   mA!! 
Firstly, RCDs are not fail safe devices, they are electromechanical in 
operation and can malfunction, and secondly, RCDs are manufac-
tured in ratings from 5 to 500  mA and have many uses. Table 3.7  
illustrates RCD ratings and applications.

Testing and Test Instruments
81
For 30  mA ratings, it is required that the RCD be injected with 
a current five times its operating current and the tripping time 
should not exceed 40   ms. 
Where loop impedance values cannot be met, RCDs of an appro-
priate rating can be installed. Their rating can be determined from 
I


 50/
s  
 where:
I Δ n is the rated operating current of the device 
 50 is the touch voltage 
 Z s is the measured loop impedance 
All RCDs have a built-in test facility in the form of a test button. 
Operating this test facility creates an artificial out-of-balance con-
dition that causes the device to trip. This only checks the mechan-
ics of the tripping operation, it is not a substitute for the tests just 
discussed.
All other items of equipment such as switchgear, controlgear 
interlocks, etc., must be checked to ensure that they are correctly 
mounted and adjusted and that they function correctly.  
 PROSPECTIVE FAULT CURRENT 
If we are able to remove all the protective devices in a system and 
connect a shorting link between line and neutral conductors, the 
resulting current that would flow at the point where the link was 
placed is known as the PFC or in this case PSCC. This is all very 
interesting, you may comment, but why would one need to know 
all this information? 
When a short circuit occurs, the device protecting the circuit in 
question has to open that circuit. If the device is incorrectly 
selected, a violent and possibly damaging explosion could result. 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
82
We have probably all experienced the loud bang and resulting 
blackened and molten copper splattered fuse holders that often 
occur with rewireable fuses. 
Each protective device has a rated breaking capacity, which indi-
cates the level of fault current that it can interrupt without arcing 
or scattering hot particles or damaging associated conductors. For 
example, rewireable fuses to BS 3036 ranging between 5 and 200   A 
have breaking capacities ranging from 1000 to 12 000  A, and HRC 
BS 88 types from 10 000 to 80 000  A. MCBs to BS 3871 (now 
obsolete but still in use) are designed for one fault level irrespective 
of size, and have ranges of 1000  A (M1), 1500  A (M1.5), 3000   A 
(M3), 4500  A (M4.5), 6000  A (M6) and 9000  A (M9). Circuit break-
ers to BS EN 60898 (European standard) have two ratings: Icn and 
Ics. Icn is the rating of fault current after which the breaker should 
not be used, and Ics is the fault rating after which the breaker is 
assumed to be able to be used without loss of performance. 
So it is important to ensure that the breaking capacity of a protec-
tive device is capable of interrupting at least the PFC at the point 
at which it is installed; hence the need to measure this current. 
The type of instrument most commonly used is a dual device which 
also measures earth fault loop impedance. It is simply connected or 
plugged into the circuit close to the point of protection, a button 
pushed and the PFC value read.

It is not always necessary to test at every point at which a protec-
tive device is installed, if the breaking capacity of the lowest rated 
device in the circuit is greater than the PSCC at the origin. In 
Figure 3.17  , clearly if the breaking capacity of the 20  A protective 
device at Y is greater than the PSCC at X, then there is no need to 
test at the other DBs as the protection there will have even greater 
breaking capacities than the 20  A device.

 Fault Finding 
Starting this chapter has been as difficult as finding a fault on a 
complex system. The old adage of ‘start at the beginning and fin-
ish at the end ’ is all right for storytellers or authors of technical 
books, but is not always sensible for fault finders! Perhaps it would 
be wise to begin by determining what exactly a fault is. 
A fault is probably best defined as a disturbance in an electrical 
system of such magnitude as to cause a malfunction of that sys-
tem. It must be remembered, of course, that such disturbances 
may be the secondary effects of mechanical damage or equipment 
failure. Actual electrical faults, or should one say faults that are 
caused by ‘electricity ’, are rare and are confined in the main to bad 
design and/or installation or deterioration and ageing. 
However, all of this still does little to indicate where to begin look-
ing for a fault. Only experience will allow one to pinpoint the exact 
seat of a breakdown, but a logical approach to fault finding will 
save a great deal of time and frustration. 
 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS  
Always look for tell-tale signs that may indicate what kind of fault 
has caused the system breakdown. If possible, ask persons present 
to describe the events that led up to the fault. For example, inspec-
tion of a rewireable fuse may reveal one of the conditions shown 
in Figures 4.1 and 4  .2. 
CHAPTER 4 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
86
The IEE Wiring Regulations define overload and short-circuit cur-
rent as follows: 
 ■  Overload current : An overcurrent occurring in a circuit which 
is electrically sound. 
 ■  Short-circuit current : An overcurrent resulting from a fault 
of negligible impedance between live conductors having a 
difference in potential under normal operating conditions.  
It is likely that other personnel will have replaced fuses or reset cir-
cuit breakers to no avail before you, the tester, is called in. In these 
circumstances they will be in a position to indicate that protective 
devices operate immediately or after a delay. This at least will give 
some clue to the type of fault. 
Let us now consider typical faults on some of the systems already 
discussed in this book, and endeavour to suggest some solutions.

Remember, however, that it is impossible to catalogue every fault 
and its cause that may occur in every system. 
Diagnostic flow charts have been included for some of the follow-
ing faults. 
 RING AND RADIAL SOCKET OUTLET CIRCUITS 
 Reported fault 
 ‘My fuse/circuit breaker blows at odd unspecified times during the 
day, with no particular appliance plugged into any particular socket. ’  
 Diagnosis  
 1.  This could be incorrect fusing, but that is unlikely because 
then the fault would always have been present. It is 
probably an insulation breakdown. 
 2.  Conduct an insulation resistance test (remember to remove 
all appliances). If the reading is low, then: 
 3.  Go to the centre of the circuit and disconnect the socket; 
disconnect the ends in the fuse board if the circuit is a ring; 
and test in both directions. 
 4.  Probably only one side will indicate a fault, so subdivide. 
Keep testing and subdividing until the faulty cable section 
or socket is located ( Figure 4.3  ).  
 New ring final circuit installations 
In Chapter 3 three methods are described for testing the continuity 
of the final conductors. The purpose is to locate interconnections 
in the ring. Should such an interconnection prove to exist, its posi-
tion in the ring must be located. Methods 1 and 2 will indicate a 
fault, but location is achieved by systematically removing sockets 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
88
to find the interconnection. Method 3 will give an indication of 
the location of the fault because tests on sockets nearest to the 
fuse board will give similar readings, whereas those beyond the 
interconnection will be considerably different.  
 RADIAL CIRCUITS FEEDING FIXED EQUIPMENT 
 Reported fault 
 ‘Every time I start my hydraulic press, the fuse blows in the board. ’ 
 Diagnosis  
 1.  This is probably a fault on the press motor windings or the 
starter. A supply cable fault would normally operate the 
protection without an attempt to start the motor. 
 2.  Check the starter for obvious signs of damage, burning, etc. 
If it seems all right, then: 
 3.  Do an insulation resistance test on the motor windings 
(Figure 4.4  ).

 Diagnosis 
This is almost certainly a cable fault. Do an insulation resistance 
test. If a fault is indicated, start looking!  
 CABLE FAULT LOCATION 
The comment ‘start looking ’ in the last example is quite accept-
able for shortish, accessible cable runs and where some sign of 
damage is evident. However, for longer, hidden cable routes, 
especially under ground, visual location is impossible. In these 
instances special tests must be applied, such as the following.

This test and its variations are based on the principle of the 
Wheatstone bridge. It is used for the location of short-circuit faults.

Variable resistors  A and B are usually incorporated in a single 
bridge instrument, and the resistances are adjusted for a zero 
reading.  
 EMERGENCY LIGHTING 
There is not a lot to go wrong with these systems other than the 
cable faults and internal failure of the unit. Cable faults are located 
in the way previously described; however, do not conduct insula-
tion resistance tests with the unit still connected, or the internal 
electronic circuitry may be damaged. 
Individual units have LEDs that indicate a healthy state of charge. 
If this is out, 
 1.  Check the mains supply. If it is all right, then: 
 2.  Check the output of the charging unit at the battery 
terminals. If this is all right, check the battery separately.  
If the LED is lit but the emergency light does not function when 
the mains supply is removed, check the lamps. If these are func-
tioning, the circuitry is probably faulty.

 SECURITY AND FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS 
Fire alarm systems have to be inspected at regular intervals and 
hence tend to be very reliable. The most common faults in such 
systems are false operation of heat or smoke detectors, perhaps 
owing to a change in the use of the protected area since they were 
first installed, or a break in the sensor cable. As the continuity of 
these cables is monitored, any fault will bring up a fault condition 
on the main panel. Simple continuity tests on cable between sen-
sors should reveal the broken section. 
Security systems are somewhat similar in that faults on cables 
or sensors will bring up an alarm condition on the main panel. 
Remove the ends of the zone in question and insert a shorting 
link. If the alarm still activates when switched on, a fault in the 
internal circuitry is indicated. If not, start at the middle of a zone 
and work back to the panel, similar to the procedure used on ring/
radial circuits, until the faulty cable or sensor is found. 
 CALL SYSTEMS 
The faults on these systems, once again, are broadly similar to 
those on alarm systems. 
 Reported fault 
 ‘ The patient in room 42 pushes the call button but nothing 
happens.’  
 Diagnosis 
This is either a faulty push-button, a break in the cable, or a defec-
tive relay or electronic component. Trial and error is the rule here: 
check out the simple and obvious first before taking the control 
panel apart ( Figure 4.7  ). 

Fault Finding
93
 CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEMS 
The most difficult faults to locate are those that occur during the 
commissioning of a newly installed system, and are almost always 
due to incorrect wiring. Naturally, not all the faults that could 
occur on all the available systems can be detailed, but there are 
one or two common mistakes that are worth mentioning: 
 1.  The CH is selected but the HW comes on, and vice versa. 
This is simply a reversal of the CH and HW feeds in the 
programmer. 
 2.  On a mid-position valve system, a reversal of the leads to 
the demand and satisfy terminals in the cylinder thermostat 
will cause various incorrect sequences depending on which 
heating options have been chosen.

On one occasion, the author installed the control wiring for a 
CH system, and was perplexed when the room thermostat oper-
ated the HW and the cylinder thermostat operated the CH. Much 
tearing of hair followed, as the system wiring proved to be correct. 
Some time later it was discovered that the DIY householder had 
installed the mid-position valve back-to-front. 
With existing systems, faults tend to be confined to equipment 
failure such as defective programmers, valves and pumps. Once 
again it must be stressed that fault location on such systems is 
eased considerably when the system is fully understood, and this 
generally comes with experience. 
 MOTOR STARTER CIRCUITS 
The usual cable faults we have already discussed must of course be 
considered, but faults in the starter itself are usually confined to 
coil failure or contact deterioration. 
 Coil failure 
If this should occur the motor will not start, for the obvious reason 
that the control circuit is defective.  
 Reported fault 
 ‘ Everything was all right this morning – the motor was running – 
but this afternoon everything just stopped, and will not start up 
again.’  
 Diagnosis 
Could be operation of circuit protection, coil failure or overload 
operation due to a motor fault or excessive mechanical loading. 

Fault Finding
95
 1.  Check overloads. If they have operated, carry out insulation 
resistance test on motor windings. If all OK, then: 
 2.  Check circuit protection. If all OK, then fault is probably 
coil failure. This can be verified by testing the coil, or 
holding in the contactor manually ( Figure 4.8  ).

 Contact deterioration 
Here is one of the few genuine faults caused by the effects of ‘elec-
tricity ’. Over time, constant operation with its attendant arcing 
will burn and pit the surface of contacts. This can lead to poor 
connection between the faces, or even the complete destruction of 
the contacts.  
 Reported fault 
 ‘ We shut down the conveyor for lunch, and when we try to start it 
up again, it only works if we keep the start button in. ’ 

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
96
 Diagnosis  
 1.  This is clearly a  ‘hold-on ’ circuit fault. The coil must be OK 
or the conveyor would not work. 
 2.  Check the continuity across the hold-on contacts with the 
contactor depressed manually (supply isolated of course). If 
open circuit is found, strip the contactor and investigate.  
 Protection faults 
Other causes of motor circuit failure often result from incorrect 
protection – fuses, MCBs or overloads – or incorrect reconnection 
after motor replacement. 
Motors may take as much as eight times their normal rated cur-
rent on starting. If the protection is of the wrong type or size, or is 
set incorrectly, it will operate.  
 Fuses 
Use a motor rated fuse, usually BS 88. These are easily recogniz-
able, as the rating has a prefix M (e.g. M20 is a 20  A motor rated 
fuse). They are designed to cater for high starting currents. 
 MCBs/CBs 
These range from the now obsolete BS 3871 types 1, 2 and 3 to 
the latest BS EN 60898 types A, B, C and D. Types 1, 2, A and B 
are usually too sensitive to handle starting currents, so types 3, 
C and D are preferred. 
 Overloads 
These are adjustable and their ratings must be suitable for the full 
load of the motor. Ensure that the overload has been selected to 
the correct rating.

Fault Finding
97
 Motor replacement 
If a motor has been diagnosed as being faulty, and is either repaired 
or replaced, always ensure that the reconnection to the motor ter-
minals is correct. A reversal of any two of the connections to a 
three-phase direct-on-line motor will reverse its direction of rota-
tion, and a reversal of the connections to the windings of a star-
delta motor could have serious implications for the motor together 
with operation of protective devices. 
 Figures 4.9 and 4.10  show the terminal arrangements for a six 
terminal motor and the correct winding connections.

 Note 
Do not attempt to uprate a protective device just because it keeps operating. It is likely 
that the wrong type rather than the wrong size was initially installed.

Wiring Systems and Fault Finding For Installation Electricians
98
If the connections to any winding are reversed, the magnet fields 
will work against each other and a serious overload will occur, 
especially when the starter changes the motor windings to the 
delta configuration. For example, never allow A2 to be connected 
to B2 and A1 to C1.  
 CONCLUSION AND A CAUTIONARY TALE 
Finally, it must be reiterated that successful and efficient fault 
finding has its basis in experience. However, for the beginner, use 
a logical and methodical approach, ask questions of the customer 
or client, and use some common sense. This in itself will often 
provide the clues for the diagnosis of system failure. 
Once upon a time there was a young electrical apprentice (who 
shall remain nameless), who was doing a little wiring job (not pri-
vate, of course). The customer asked the apprentice, while he was 
there, to investigate whether a cracked socket needed replacing. 
Of course he agreed to (thinking: ‘extras!’), and proceeded to undo 
the socket without isolating. There was a pop and a flash and the 
ring circuit fuse operated. ‘Silly me, ’ he thought, ‘I’ll just repair the 
fuse, I must have shorted something out in the socket. ’ ‘Hold on, ’
thought he, ‘do this properly: never replace a fuse until the circuit 
has been checked first. ’
An insulation resistance test seemed to be the order of the day, 
so naturally all appliances were removed from the ring and the 
test applied. It showed a line neutral short circuit. ‘Oh! bother ’ (or 
some such expletive), he muttered, ‘Where do I start? ’
Unfortunately the ring circuit was wired in the form of junc-
tion boxes in the upstairs floor void with single drops down to 
each socket. Splitting the ring meant gaining access to those JBs. 
Needless to say there were fitted carpets and tongued and grooved 
floorboards, and no access traps. 

Fault Finding
99
Five hours later, with carpets and floorboards up everywhere and 
a puzzled customer who did not understand such an upheaval to 
replace a cracked socket, the faulty drop was found. The appren-
tice ran downstairs but could not immediately find the associated 
socket outlet. It was there of course, in a cupboard, and next to it 
was a fridge with a door like a cupboard door, and naturally the 
fridge was plugged into the socket.  ‘Heavens above! ’ and ‘flip me ’
said the apprentice, ‘I wish I had asked the customer if there were 
any appliances I had missed. Worse than that, how do I explain 
this one away? ’ Well, needless to say, he did, using the most 
impressive technical jargon, and vowed never to make the same 
mistake again.

  Appendix 1
 Shock Risk and Safe Isolation 
 ELECTRIC SHOCK 
This is the passage of current through the body of such magnitude 
as to have significant harmful effects.  Table A1.1  and Figure A1.1  
illustrate the generally accepted effects of current passing through 
the human body. How then are we at risk of electric shock and 
how do we protect against it?  
 There are two ways in which we can be at risk: 
 1.  Intentional or accidental contact with live parts of 
equipment or systems that are intended to be live.  
 2.  Contact with conductive parts which are not meant to be 
live, but which have become live due to a fault.  
The conductive parts associated with point (2) above can either be 
metalwork of electrical equipment and accessories (Class l) and 
that of electrical wiring systems (e.g. metal conduit and trunking),

called exposed conductive parts, or other metalwork (e.g. pipes, 
radiators and girders), called extraneous conductive parts.  
 Basic protection 
How can we prevent danger to persons and livestock from contact 
with intentionally live parts? Clearly, we must minimize the risk of 
such contact and this can be achieved by basic protection, that is 
 ■  insulating any live parts  
 ■  ensuring any uninsulated live parts are housed in suitable 
enclosures and/or are behind barriers.  
The use of a residual current device (RCD) cannot prevent con-
tact with live parts, but it can be used as an addition to any of the 
other measures taken, provided that its rating,  I n, is 30  mA or less 
and has an operating time of not more than 40  ms at an operating 
current of  I 	n    5. 
It should be noted that RCDs must not be used as the sole means 
of protection.  
 Fault protection 
How can we protect against shock from contact with unintention-
ally live, exposed or extraneous conductive parts whilst touching 
earth, or from contact between live exposed and/or extraneous con-
ductive parts? The most common method is by protective earthing, 
in case of fault and protective equipotential bonding and automatic 
disconnection in case of a fault.  
All extraneous conductive parts are joined together with a main pro-
tective bonding conductor and connected to the main earthing ter-
minal, and all exposed conductive parts are connected to the main

earthing terminal by the circuit protective conductors. Add to this, 
overcurrent protection that will operate fast enough when a fault 
occurs and the risk of severe electric shock is significantly reduced.  
 What is earth and why and how we
connect to it? 
The thin layer of material which covers our planet – rock, clay, 
chalk or whatever – is what we in the world of electricity refer to 
as earth. So, why do we need to connect anything to it? After all, it 
is not as if earth is a good conductor.  
It might be wise at this stage to investigate potential difference 
(PD). A PD is exactly what it says it is: a difference in potential 
(volts). In this way, two conductors having PDs of, say, 20 and 
26 V have a PD between them of 26     20    6 V. The original PDs 
(i.e. 20 and 26  V) are the PDs between 20  V and 0  V and 26  V and 
0 V. So where does this 0  V or zero potential come from? The sim-
ple answer is, in our case, the earth. The definition of earth is, 
therefore, the conductive mass of earth, whose electric potential at 
any point is conventionally taken as zero.  
Thus, if we connect a voltmeter between a live part (e.g. the line con-
ductor of a socket outlet) and earth, we may read 230  V; the conductor 
is at 230  V and the earth at zero. The earth provides a path to com-
plete the circuit. We would measure nothing at all if we connected 
our voltmeter between, say, the positive 12  V terminal of a car battery 
and earth, as in this case the earth plays no part in any circuit.  
Figure A1.2 illustrates this difference.
 So, a person in an installation touching a live part whilst standing 
on the earth would take the place of the voltmeter and could suffer 
a severe electric shock. Remember that the accepted lethal level of 
shock current passing through a person is only 50   mA or 1/20  A.

The same situation would arise if the person were touching a 
faulty appliance and a gas or water pipe ( Figure A1.3  ).  
One method of providing some measure of protection against these 
effects is, as we have seen, to join together (bond) all metallic parts 
and connect them to earth. This ensures that all metalwork in a 
healthy installation is at or near 0  V and, under fault conditions, 
all metalwork will rise to a similar potential. So, simultaneous 
contact with two such metal parts would not result in a dangerous 
shock, as there would be no significant PD between them.  
Unfortunately, as mentioned, earth itself is not a good conductor, 
unless it is very wet. Therefore, it presents a high resistance to the 
flow of fault current. This resistance is usually enough to restrict 
fault current to a level well below that of the rating of the protect-
ive device, leaving a faulty circuit uninterrupted. Clearly, this is an 
unhealthy situation.

In all but the most rural areas, consumers can connect to a 
metallic earth return conductor, which is ultimately connected 
to the earthed neutral of the supply. This, of course, presents a 
low-resistance path for fault currents to operate the protection.  
In summary, connecting metalwork to earth places that metal at 
or near zero potential and bonding between metallic parts puts 
such parts at a similar potential even under fault conditions. Add 
to this a low-resistance earth fault return path, which will enable 
the circuit protection to operate very fast, and we have signifi-
cantly reduced the risk of electric shock.  
We can see from this how important it is to check that equipment 
earthing is satisfactory and that there is no damage to conductor 
insulation.  
 SAFE ISOLATION OF SUPPLIES 
Before any work is undertaken on low-voltage (50–1000  V AC) 
installations, supplies should be isolated and proved dead; the 
procedure is as follows: 
 1.  Identify the circuit or item to be worked on.  
 2.  Switch off/isolate and lock off or place warning notices if 
locking is not available.  
 3.  Select a suitable approved voltage indicator and check that 
it works, on a known supply.  
 4.  Test that the circuit or equipment is dead using the tester.  
 5.  Recheck the tester on the known supply again.  
Never assume or take someone else’s word that supplies are dead 
and safe to work on. Always check for yourself.

 Resistance in series 
These are resistances joined end to end in the form of a chain. The 
total resistance increases as more resistances are added ( Figure A2.1  ). 
Hence, if a cable length is increased, its resistance will increase 
in proportion. For example, a 100  m length of conductor has twice 
the resistance of a 50   m length of the same diameter.  
 Resistance in parallel 
These are resistances joined like the rungs of a ladder. Here the 
total resistance decreases the more there are ( Figure A2.2  ).

 The insulation between conductors is in fact countless millions of 
very high value resistances in parallel. Hence an increase in cable 
length results in a decrease in insulation resistance. This value is 
measured in millions of ohms (i.e. megohms, M Ω). 
The overall resistance of two or more conductors will also decrease 
if they are connected in parallel ( Figure A2.3  ).  
The total resistance will be half of either one and would be the 
same as the resistance of a 2   mm 2 conductor. Hence resistance 
decreases if conductor cross-sectional area increases.  
 Example A2.1 
If the resistance of a 1.0  mm2 conductor is 19.5  mΩ/m, what would be the resistance of:
 1.  85  m of 1.0   mm 2 conductor  
 2.  1  m of 6.0   mm 2 conductor  
 3.  25  m of 4.0   mm 2 conductor  
 4.  12  m of 0.75   mm 2 conductor.  
 Answers 
 1.  1.0  mm 2 is 19.5   m Ω /m, so, 85   m would be 19.5     85/1000     1.65  Ω 
 2.  A 6.0   mm 2 conductor would have a resistance 6 times less than a 1.0   mm 2 
conductor, i.e. 19.5/6    3.25  mΩ 
 3.  25  m of 4.0   mm 2 would be 19.5     25/4    1000    0.12  Ω 
 4.  19.5   mΩ/m  1.5 (the ratio of 0.75  mm2 to 1.00  mm2 conductor)  12 m     0.351  Ω .

 POWER, CURRENT AND VOLTAGE 
As we have already seen, at a basic level, power     current    volt-
age, or P    I    V. However, two other formulae can be produced: 
P     I 2    R and P    V 2 / R. Here are some examples of how these 
may be used. 
 1.  A 3   kW 230  V immersion heater has ceased to work 
although fuses, etc., are all intact. A test using a low-
resistance ohmmeter should reveal the heaters resistance, 
which can be determined  from:

This can be compared with the manufacturer’s intended 
resistance. This would show that the element is not broken 
and further investigation should take place (probably a faulty 
thermostat). 
 2.  Two lighting points have been wired, incorrectly, in series. 
The effect on the light output from two 100   W/230   V lamps 
connected to these points can be shown as follows:  
Each lamp will have a resistance of R    V 2 / P (when hot)

It will be seen that each lamp will have only 115  V as a supply 
(Figure A2.4). Hence each will deliver a power of  P    V 2/R ,

which is a quarter of its rated value, and so both lamps will 
be only a quarter of their intended brightness.  
 3.  The current flowing in a 10   m length of 2.5   mm 2 twin 
cable is 12  A. The resistance of such cable is approximately 
0.015   Ω /m, so the power consumed by the cable would be:
