Ultraviolet Catastrophe
The ultraviolet catastrophe is the prediction of classical physics that
the energy density of black-body radiation becomes infinite at high
frequencies or short wavelengths. This implication is expressed by the
Rayleigh–Jeans law for the energy density, r(l):
dE ¼ r(l)dl;
r(l) ¼ 8pkT
l4
;
r(l) !N as l ! 0
The catastrophe was avoided by Planck’s introduction of quant-
ization, which quenches the contribution of the high-frequency,
short-wavelength oscillations of the electromagnetic field. See black-
body radiation.
Uncertainty Principle
The (Heisenberg) uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to
specify simultaneously with arbitrary precision both the linear mo-
mentum, pq, and position, q, of a particle:
DqDpqZ 1
2 ˉh
The explanation of the principle in this form is based on the expression
of the wavefunction of a localized particle as a superposition of
waves, each one representing a state of linear momentum (Figure U.1).

To achieve a tightly localized superposition, a wide range of wavelength
is required, so the representation of a localized particle implies that its
linear momentum is correspondingly indefinite.
The more general form of the principle recognizes that two
variables O1 and O2 are complementary, not have the same eigen-
functions, if the corresponding operators, bO1 and bO2, to not commute.
Then

DO ¼ {hbO

2}1=2
The so-called energy–time uncertainty relation, DEEh/t, does not fit
into this pattern as there is no operator for time in quantum mech-
anics; it is best regarded as a consequence of the Schrödinger equa-
tion and the fact that the energy of a state is ill-defined if the state has
a finite lifetime.
Unit Cell
A unit cell is an imaginary parallelepiped (a parallel-sided figure) that
replicates a crystal by translational displacements. It can be thought
of as the fundamental unit from which the entire crystal can be
constructed by purely translational displacements. A primitive unit cell
is formed by drawing straight lines between neighbouring lattice
points so that each cell has one lattice point in it at its origin. It is
often more convenient to draw a nonprimitive unit cell that has a lattice
points at its centre or on pairs of faces and chosen to have sides that
have the shortest lengths and are most perpendicular to one another.
See Bravais lattice. The lengths of the sides are denoted a, b, and c
