Abstract: Using the principles of the modern scattering amplitudes programme, we develop
a formalism for constructing the amplitudes of three-dimensional topologically massive gauge
theories and gravity. Inspired by recent developments in four dimensions, we construct the
three-dimensional equivalent of x-variables, ﬁrst deﬁned in [1], for conserved matter currents
coupled to topologically massive gauge bosons or gravitons. Using these, we bootstrap various
matter-coupled gauge-theory and gravitational scattering amplitudes, and conjecture that
topologically massive gauge theory and topologically massive gravity are related by the double
copy. To motivate this idea further, we show explicitly that the Landau gauge propagator on
the gauge theory side double copies to the de Donder gauge propagator on the gravity side.

Introduction
Three dimensional quantum ﬁeld theories are of interest in many areas of physics, from
condensed matter to string theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence.
In some sense,
quantum ﬁeld theories in three dimensions have a much richer structure than their four
dimensional cousins. This is partly due to the fact that Chern-Simons terms are permitted
in odd dimensions, which in 2 + 1 dimensions allows for the presence of particles with
fractional statistics (anyons). One particularly interesting class of three dimensional QFT’s
are topologically massive theories [2], which include gauge theories and gravity, both with a
topological mass related to the Chern-Simons level number. Topologically massive theories are
parity-odd and have the remarkable property of being massive and gauge invariant, and could
be useful as a toy model for understanding gauge theories and gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions,
giving rise to e.g. the BTZ black hole [3] as a playground to test AdS/CFT.
In this paper, we will explore this class of theories by bootstrapping their scattering using the
modern on-shell approach. Scattering amplitudes in three dimensions are well studied using
spinor-helicity techniques [4–18], and we will utilise this technology extensively.
Inspired
by recent progress in four dimensions, we will develop a formalism in three-dimensions for
constructing the amplitudes directly, in particular by constructing the three-dimensional
equivalent of x-variables, originally deﬁned in four dimensions in [1]. In particular we will
ﬁnd that this is extremely useful in the context of scattering in topologically massive gravity
[19], whose complicated Feynman rules make calculating scattering amplitudes horribly
cumbersome. In four dimensions, ratios of x-variables encode both ‘electric’ and ‘magnetic’
degrees of freedom, where the magnetic degrees of freedom are encoded by a Levi-Civita term
coupled to a Dirac string [20–22]. In three-dimensions, we ﬁnd that the magnetic degrees of
freedom are encoded in the x-variables in none other than the Chern-Simons term. Crucial
to this construction is the fact that the little group of massless ﬁelds in D dimensions is the
same as for massive ﬁelds in D −1 dimensions, allowing us to use much of the technology
built for four dimensional massless amplitudes to construct three dimensional massive ones.
Along the way we will motivate the idea that topologically massive gauge and gravity theories
are related via the double copy, a correspondence between gauge and gravitational theories
originally formulated in the context of massless scattering amplitudes in four dimensions
[23–25]. At this point, the double copy has been extended to include massive particles [26–31]
and purely classical solutions [32–61] including in three spacetime dimensions [62–64]. In three
dimensions, however, the double copy is not so straightforward, since we almost immediately
hit a road block in the sense that massless Yang-Mills theories only propagate scalar degrees of
freedom and 3D general relativity propagates none, being purely topological (the Weyl tensor
vanishes). That being said, strictly speaking the double copy relates Yang-Mills theories to
dilaton-axion gravity rather than simply general relativity, and it has been shown that the
classical double copy does indeed hold in three dimensions [62–64], relating the gauge theory
solution to a dilaton-like solution. Furthermore, there are many examples of supergravity
– 2 –

theories that are double copies, and this is equally true in three dimensions where many
diﬀerent massless super-Yang Mills amplitudes double copy to their supergravity counterparts
[11, 16].
An interesting observation that one can make about gravity in general dimensions is that
massless degrees of freedom in D dimensions are in some sense mapped to massive degrees of
freedom in D−1 dimensions. For example, the massless graviton propagator in D dimensions
is equal to the massive graviton propagator in D −1 dimensions [65]: massive particles in
D −1 dimensions have the same number of degrees of freedom as massless particles in D
dimensions1. As alluded to earlier, for both four dimensional massless theories and three
dimensional massive theories the little group is U(1). Together with dimensional analysis and
locality, this is all we need to construct a large class of massive particle scattering amplitudes
in three dimensions.
We achieve this by noting that spinor-helicity variables in 2 + 1 dimensions naturally encode
the spin degrees of freedom of topologically massive particles, just as their four dimensional
counterparts encode helicities. As alluded to earlier, this allows us to classify amplitudes
according to their little group structure — U(1) for massive particles — and bootstrap
the amplitudes directly by demanding that little group covariance, locality and dimensional
consistency are respected. We ﬁnd that the double copy is manifest at the two and three
particle level, in the oﬀ-shell propagator and in a selection of on-shell amplitudes. We conﬁrm
a number of these results by computing the amplitudes directly from the Feynman rules in
appendix E.

Scattering Amplitudes in 2+1 Dimensions
In order to construct amplitudes in 2 + 1 dimensions, we will make extensive use of the
spinor-helicity formalism, which in D = 3 consists only of angle brackets |i⟩and spinor
contractions of the form ⟨ij⟩= λα
i λβ
j ǫβα. In D spacetime dimensions, the Lorentz group is
given by SO(D−1, 1). In order to construct amplitudes in D = 3, we need to know about the
little group structure that corresponds to either massive or massless particles. For massive
particles in D dimensions, the little group is SO(D −1), and for massless it’s E(D −2). For
D = 3 then, this gives SO(2) ∼U(1) as the little group for massive particles and E(1) ∼R for
massless. This is easily seen by considering a massive particle in its rest frame or a massless
particle boosted along a given axis.
In order to build scattering amplitudes, we need to consider the possible one-particle states
that can exist in three dimensions, presumably having spin-s and mass m (along with whatever
other quantum numbers may be present). As usual, these will be classiﬁed by the Casimirs
1To see this, we note that massless gravitons have 1
2D(D −3) degrees of freedom while massive gravitons
have 1
2(D + 1)(D −2). We see then that massless gravitons in four dimensions and massive gravitons in three
both have 2 degrees of freedom.

of the Poincar´e group SO(2, 1), p2 and S2, which are related to the invariant mass and the
spin, respectively. The spin in this case characterised by the Pauli-Lubanski pseudoscalar
σ = ǫµνρσµνpρ = J · p
(2.1)
where σµν
=
i
4[γµ, γν]

2ǫµνργρ
is the angular momentum tensor and pρ
the
three-momentum.
Massless particles in D = 3 only come in two types: scalars and (spinless) fermions [66, 67].
This means that familiar concepts in D = 4 gauge theories, mediated by massless spin-1
particles, do not necessarily exist for massless theories in D = 3. This is even worse for
gravity, where massless gravitons are purely topological and have no degrees of freedom. The
situation is far less dire for generic massive states, which have two degrees of freedom on-shell
and possible spins s = ± 1
2, ±1, ± 3
2, ±2, · · · , and are essentially classiﬁed in the same way as
massless particles in D = 4 (i.e. by their helicity). In D = 4, the spinor helicity formalism
encapsulates the helicity degrees of freedom for massless particles, and we can do the same
in D = 3 for massive states of spin ±s.
In this paper, we are interested in topologically massive gauge theories, where the sign of the
spin is given by the sign of the Chern-Simons level number k, which in turn is related to the
topological mass as sgn(s) =
k
|k| =
m
|m| [2].
Momentum vectors in three dimensions have a spinor decomposition given by
pµσαβ
µ
= pαβ = λ(α¯λβ),
(2.2)
where we have followed the conventions set out in appendix A, and the spinors are given
explicitly as
λα =

p2 −im
p1 −p0
!
,
¯λα = −
1
√p0 −p1
 
p2 + im
p1 −p0
!
.
(2.3)
We will often use angle brackets as a shorthand for the spinor inner product, i.e.
ǫαβλiβλjα ≡⟨ij⟩,
ǫαβλiβ¯λjα ≡⟨i¯j⟩.
(2.4)
We observe then that these particular spinor helicity variables are very natural objects to
consider for topologically massive states in three dimensions. This is because each spinor λ
or ¯λ diﬀers only by the sign of the imaginary part im = isgn(s)|m|, relative to the sign of the
momentum components. This means that λ (¯λ) encodes the negative (positive) spin-degrees
of freedom for topologically massive theories, in analogy to how λ and ˜λ encodes the helicity
states for massless theories in 4D.
We can use this information to infer how amplitudes for a given spin should behave under
– 4 –

little group transformations, again analogous to 4D, i.e. that
An(eiωλi, e−iω¯λi) →e2isiωA(λi, ¯λi).
(2.5)
Kinematics in three dimensions are more constrained than in four dimensions. We can express
dot products of momentum vectors in terms of spinors as
2pi · pj = 1
2 (⟨ij⟩⟨¯i¯j⟩+ ⟨i¯j⟩⟨¯ij⟩) ,
(2.6)
which immediately tells us that p2
i = 1
4 ⟨i¯i⟩2 = −m2
i . Furthermore, we see that products of
masses are now subject to the Schouten identity, and we ﬁnd that they can be written in
terms of spinors as
mimj = −1
4(⟨i¯i⟩⟨j¯j⟩) = −1
4(⟨ij⟩⟨¯i¯j⟩−⟨i¯j⟩⟨¯ij⟩)
(2.7)
The Mandelstam variables are given by
sij = −(pi + pj)2 = m2
i + m2
j −2pi · pj.
(2.8)
We also note that we can again use the Schouten identity to write
2imi ⟨jk⟩= ⟨i¯i⟩⟨jk⟩= ⟨j¯i⟩⟨ik⟩−⟨ji⟩⟨¯ik⟩.
(2.9)
Momentum conservation for massive 3D momentum is given by
n

i=1
(|¯i⟩⟨i| + |i⟩⟨¯i|) = 0.
(2.10)
2.1
Three Particle Amplitudes
There are no massless three-particle amplitudes in three spacetime dimensions, since there are
no Lorentz invariant objects that one can write down that aren’t zero2, since sij = ⟨ij⟩2 = 0
for all i, j. Massive three-particle amplitudes are allowed however, and for self-interacting
theories we can construct them directly from symmetry considerations. There are two possible
spin conﬁgurations we can write down at the three particle level: all same-spin (s1 = s2 = s3)
or one diﬀerent (e.g.
s1 = s2 = −s3), with all other amplitudes obtainable by complex
conjugation or particle relabelling.
Scattering amplitudes in spacetime dimension D with n external legs have mass dimension
[An] = n
2 (2−D) + D. In D = 3 then, this implies a fractional mass dimension for amplitudes
2In principle, we could have a constant three-particle amplitude here, corresponding to a term ∼gφ3, where
[g] = 3/2, however we won’t consider such a theory here.
– 5 –

with an odd numbers of legs and speciﬁcally that 3-particle amplitudes must have mass
dimension 3/2. In addition to this, the three-particle amplitudes must have the correct little
group scaling and they must vanish in the all massless limit, although this last constraint is
trivial. In order to expose the little group covariance of a given amplitude, we can act on it
with the spin-operator
Si = λi
∂
∂λi
−¯λi

(2.11)
which returns the spin for a given particle i. The simplest object that satisﬁes SiA3[i±s] =
±sA3 and can be built from only λ, ¯λ and m is given by

(2.13)
where other spin conﬁgurations can be found by barring and unbarring the diﬀerent spinors
and the coupling is required to have mass dimension [gabc] = 3/2 −s for consistency.
We see immediately that for s = 1 the coupling must inherit the anti-symmetry properties
of the spinors to respect Bose symmetry, i.e. that gabc = −gacb, meaning this self-interaction
must come from a non-Abelian theory. For s = 2 there is no such requirement, however
do note that the coupling must now have dimension [gabc] = −1/2 and as such should
describe a gravitational theory. While it is certainly interesting to study both pure gauge
theory and pure gravity, in this paper we will restrict ourselves to considering these ﬁelds
when coupled to matter. Speciﬁcally, we will consider matter particles minimally coupled
to either topologically massive gauge ﬁelds or topologically massive gravitons and deﬁne the
three-dimensional equivalent of the x-variables ﬁrst deﬁned in [1]. We will then show that
gauge and gravity mediated interactions are related by simply squaring the x-variables, as is
the case in four dimensions.
In the four dimensional case, the x-variables are deﬁned as proportionality constants between
massless basis spinors when the mass of each external particle are equal. While in this case
we have no massless basis spinors, we can still consider same-mass matter particles, which
essentially just means we are considering spin-s particles coupled to conserved matter currents.
Considering the amplitude above, we can easily couple scalars to the topologically massive
spin s boson by taking the ‘scalar’ limit of two of the particles (by barring half of the particles
– 6 –

spinors). For example, the scalar-scalar-massive gauge boson amplitude is given by
A3[10, 20, 3s] = g⟨¯3|p1|¯3⟩s

= g(mx12)s,
A3[10, 20, 3−s] = g⟨3|p1|3⟩s

(2.14)
Pleasingly, this is also what we would obtain by dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional
x-variables, and so we deﬁne x by analogy as

To see that these are inverse to one another, we note that
⟨3|u1|3⟩⟨¯3|u1|¯3⟩= ⟨3|u1p3u1|¯3⟩+ im3 ⟨3|u1u1|¯3⟩= 4m2
3,
(2.16)
where we have used the identity in eq. (A.13).
We can then write a generalisation for a topologically massive gauge ﬁeld of spin s coupled
to a spin s′ matter current3, noting that these should satisfy limms,ms′→0 A3 = 0,
A3[1s′, 2s′, 3s] = g(m1x12)s

(2.19)
where the diﬀerent spin conﬁgurations can be chosen by barring the appropriate spinor,
provided the absolute value of the spin remains the same for both matter particles.
One important thing to note about topologically massive theories is that they are not parity
symmetric. In order to consider a parity symmetric theory, we could follow Ref. [2] and
consider a doublet of particles that are identical in every way except for their mass, which
diﬀers by a sign as m = ±|m|. This would amount to summing over the distinct propagating
particles (which would now carry both spins ±s), which would eliminate parity-speciﬁc (i.e.
Levi-Civita) terms, eﬀectively giving pure Yang-Mills contributions. We will not consider
such parity symmetric theories here since we wish to consider the full topologically massive
theory, which essentially means we will not sum over any x-ratios that we encounter. However,
it is interesting to consider how deforming the parity symmetric theory (e.g. 3D Yang-Mills)
might lead to a parity violating one by, for example, deforming the x-ratios. This has been
3We note that this formula generalises the one expected for a massless gauge boson and recovers it in the
appropriate limit, e.g.

Given that there are no massless gravitons in 2 + 1 dimensions, you might worry that the
massless limit of this amplitude doesn’t vanish as expected. You would be right to worry,
since in fact we ﬁnd in the limit that
t2 + u2 = (t + u)2 −2tu = 4(m2

(3.14)
Since all massless particles in D = 2 + 1 are either scalars or fermions, we might imagine
that this is a dilaton mediated amplitude that survives the massless limit. This is reminiscent
of the vDVZ discontinuity in higher dimensions, where the amplitude for a strictly massless
graviton exchange is not the same as for the massless limit of the exchanged massive graviton,
– 9 –

due to the contribution of the dilaton that doesn’t vanish in the limit. We explore this idea
further in appendix. G.
From the perspective of the double copy, this is also not entirely unexpected, since the double
copy typically relates spin-1 particles with gravitons, dilatons and Kalb-Ramond (axion)
ﬁelds. Recently it has been demonstrated that the point charge potential in three-dimensions
gives rise to a dilaton like potential under the classical double copy [63, 64]. Furthermore,
we also know that scalar-mediated (massless) supergravity amplitudes are non-zero in three
dimensions [11]. To compare with this, we can take the all massless limit of the amplitude,
taking the external scalars to be part of the super-multiplet, giving rise to the amplitude

This precisely matches the amplitude in the supergravity case [11], where we have used the

While this amplitude is easily reproduced via Feynman diagram, it is possible that there is
an additional contact term contribution that is not accounted for. To see this, it would be
desireable to have a gauge-dependent polarization vector, in order to perhaps show explicitly
– 11 –

that one could gauge-away any contact term contribution. In principle, we could derive an
on-shell polarization vector that depends on an (possibly light-like) axial-gauge vector, much
as one does in four dimensions. We leave this, and the tentative result above, to further study
in the future.

The Propagator Double Copy
Recently, the four dimensional gauge-theory propagator (in the Landau gauge) was shown
to enjoy a double copy relationship only if magnetic degrees of freedom were included in
the propagating spectrum [22]. Since the magnetic degrees of freedom in three dimensions
are in the form of a Chern-Simons term, it seems quite natural from this perspective that
topologically massive gauge theory double copies to topologically massive gravity. For freely
propagating particles to enjoy this relationship, the propagator ought to double copy.
Non-Abelian topologically massive gauge theory, or Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory, is
described by the action [2]

where the trace is over gauge group indices, the coupling has mass dimension [e] = 1/2 and
the Chern-Simons level k is dimensionless. To gauge ﬁx, we can add a gauge-ﬁxing term to
the action, of the form
LGF = −

2αe2 (∂µAµ)2.
(4.2)
Since this part of our discussion will not rely on the particular gauge group under
consideration, for simplicity we consider the colour stripped propagator

The graviton propagator is given by

(4.4)
where we will ignore any terms that vanish when contracted with conserved currents. Working

(4.9)
This is precisely the structure of the propagator for topologically massive gravity [2], and
provides a strong hint that we are on the right track: free topologically massive gauge bosons
appear to double copy to free topologically massive gravitons. We note especially that the
massless pole comes out naturally, including with the ‘wrong’ sign, such that any massless
propagation must arise due to a spin-2 ghost. However, we also see that the coeﬃcient of
the massless ghost mode is diﬀerent when compared with Ref. [2]. This has no eﬀect on the
amplitudes if we consider the case of a deﬁnite non-zero mass and everything on-shell (as
we did in the above sections), however this does mean that the massless limit becomes more
complicated. It is instructive to therefore examine the full propagator, including the pieces
that vanish when combined with conserved currents. In this case, we ﬁnd a double-copied

This matches the propagator in the de Donder gauge [72] only if we choose q2 = −m2 in the
numerator of ﬁrst term in eq. (4.11). However, for generic (oﬀ-shell) q this term has residues
at both q2 = 0 and q2 = −m2, which diﬀer by a factor 1/2 only when we leave q2 in the
numerator as oﬀ-shell. More precisely, we have

Taking the numerator to be on-shell then gives the correct TMG double copy, however it
may be interesting to examine the double copy where we allow the possibility of a consistent
massless limit.

Discussion
In this paper we have constructed various three dimensional scattering amplitudes in
topologically massive gauge theories and gravity. We have constructed the three dimensional
equivalent of the x-variables, showing that they can be used to directly construct a range
of amplitudes for matter-coupled gauge ﬁelds or gravitons, and that these agree with those
constructed by Feynman diagram. Furthermore, we have motivated the idea that topologically
massive gauge and gravity theories in three dimensions are related by the double copy. There
are many desirable avenues of study to pursue following this. The most natural next step
is to consider pure gauge boson and graviton amplitudes in the context of the double copy
and BCJ duality. Since the Feynman rules for Yang-Mills are essentially the same in three
and four dimensions, it is likely that BCJ duality at least partially holds for topologically
massive theories. It may be that a clever choice of gauge (such as the Gervais-Nueve gauge
in three dimensions) might give rise to an oﬀ-shell double copy of the vertex as was shown in
four dimensions in [73]. Since we have deﬁned x-variables, an obvious next step is to study
– 14 –

their deformation, as has been successful in four dimensions [21, 22, 52, 68–70, 74, 75]. This
will allow us to construct spinning solutions and to study electric-magnetic type dualities,
which are extremely rich in 2+1 dimensions, and will be studied elsewhere [? ]. Another
interesting avenue of study is to consider topologically massive supersymmetric theories. It
is well known that the superpartner of the graviton — the Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld — has a
topologically massive construction [2] and it would be interesting to explore the possibility of a
double copy here. Interestingly, this too suﬀers from a vDVZ-like discontinuity in general [76],
as was shown recently using amplitudes techniques in four dimensions [77], and it would also
be interesting to see if this too manifests itself in three dimensions. Finally, there are many
interesting quantum aspects of topologically massive gauge theories to explore using on-shell
techniques, where it is hopeful that a loop-expansion in topologically massive QCD [78] might
be recycled via the double copy to understand loops in topologically massive gravity. We leave
these interesting prospects to the future.

Using these, we can derive the spinor-helicity identities
⟨a|p1p2p3|b⟩= ⟨ab⟩ǫ(p1, p2, p3) + 2(p1 · p2) ⟨a|p3|b⟩−(p1 · p3) ⟨a|p2|b⟩
(A.12)
⟨a|p1p2|b⟩= ⟨ab⟩(p1 · p2) + ǫµνρp1µp2ν ⟨a|γρ|b⟩
For b = ¯a, this simpliﬁes to become
⟨a|p1p2p3|¯a⟩= −2imǫ(p1, p2, p3) + 4(p1 · p2)(p3 · pa) −2(p1 · p3)(p2 · pa)
(A.13)
⟨a|p1p2|¯a⟩= −2im(p1 · p2) + 2ǫµνρp1µp2νpaρ.

We note that these are related to the conventional 2+1 dimensional spinors by
u(pi) = ⟨i| = −¯v(pi),
¯u(pi) = |¯i⟩= −vpi
The Dirac equations are given by
pj |j⟩= −imj |j⟩,
pj |¯j⟩= imj |¯j⟩,
⟨j| pj = imj ⟨j| ,
⟨¯j| pj = −imj ⟨¯j|
(A.16)
– 16 –

These forms allow us to write
λα¯λβ = pαβ + imǫαβ,
¯λαλβ = pαβ −imǫαβ,
(A.17)
which immediately implies that λ(α¯λβ) = pαβ and that
ǫαβλβ¯λα = ⟨λ¯λ⟩= −⟨¯λλ⟩= −2im.
(A.18)
We can contract in a σ matrix to ﬁnd that λα¯λβσµαβ = pαβσµαβ + imTr (γµ) and therefore
that
⟨i|γµ|¯i⟩= ⟨¯i|γµ|i⟩= 2pµ.
(A.19)
Using the above relations we can derive the following identities
⟨i¯j⟩⟨¯ij⟩= sij −(mi −mj)2,
⟨¯i¯j⟩⟨ij⟩= sij −(mi + mj)2,
(A.20)
with sij = −(pi + pj)2.
For four same-mass particles i, j, k, l that share a propagator, we have the identity
Tr (pipjpk) = 2ǫµνρpiµpjνpkρ = i√sijsjkskl = ⟨¯ij⟩⟨¯jk⟩⟨¯ki⟩.

We make frequent use of the Schouten identity, which is given by
ǫαβǫγδ + ǫαγǫδβ + ǫαδǫβγ = 0.
(A.26)
It is often more useful in the spinor-helicity form, where we simply contract in four arbitrary
spinors to ﬁnd a relationship of the form
⟨ij⟩⟨kl⟩+ ⟨ik⟩⟨lj⟩+ ⟨il⟩⟨jk⟩= 0,
(A.27)

For comparison, lets compute the Fermion amplitude directly from the Feynman rules. The
s channel diagram is given by
A4[1234] = V µ(p1, p2)DµνV ν(p3, p4) = ⟨¯1|γµ|¯2⟩Dµν ⟨3|γν|4⟩

Polarization Vectors
Topologically massive theories have the odd property that they are both massive and gauge
invariant, unlike theories endowed with a generic Proca mass which lack any gauge freedom.
This means that constructing polarization vectors isn’t straightforward [78, 80–82], since one
needs to consider encoding both the massive physical degrees of freedom and the gauge degrees
of freedom into one object. On shell, this is slightly less problematic, and we know what we
need to satisfy: we need a transverse polarization vector with ±1 spin degrees of freedom and
a gauge choice that can result in no more than a total derivative in the action. The tensor
product of two vectors with diﬀerent helicities should also produce the tensorial structure
of the oﬀ-shell propagator. That all being said, constructing such an object is not entirely
without its diﬃculties, and so it will suﬃce for our purposes to ﬁnd a speciﬁc gauge-ﬁxed
polarization vector.
The equations of motion for the gauge ﬁeld Aa
µ are given by

ηµρ∂ν + m
2 ǫµνρ

F νρ = 0.
(F.1)
In momentum space, we can ﬁnd a plane-wave solution by assuming the form Aa
µ(q) =
caǫµ(q)eiq·x, which we need to satisfy the equation
 −q2ηµρ + qµqρ + imǫµνρqν
ǫρ(q)eiq·x = 0.
(F.2)
We need to choose a gauge at this point, and we will choose the Landau gauge qµǫµ(q) = 0,
which reduces the problem to ﬁnding a vector that satisﬁes
q2ǫµ(q) = imǫµνρqνǫρ(q).
(F.3)
Since we are working in spinor-helicity variables, we will make an Ansatz of the form ǫµ =
⟨a|γµ|b⟩and ﬁx a, b such that it solves the equation and is correctly normalised. To this end,
we can use the Poincar´e algebra to write the right hand side as
imqν ⟨a|ǫµνργρ|b⟩= imqν ⟨a|γµγν −ηµν|b⟩
(F.4)
= im (⟨a|γµq|b⟩−qµ ⟨ab⟩)
(F.5)
– 23 –

Choosing a = b = q then gives
im ⟨q|γµq|q⟩= im
2 ⟨¯qq⟩ǫµ = q2ǫµ,
(F.6)
which is precisely the left hand side of eq.
(F.3), where we have used ⟨¯qq⟩= 2im and
m2 = −q2 on-shell.
Normalising this such that ǫµǫ∗
µ = −1, we ﬁnd polarization vectors of the form
ǫµ−= ⟨q|γµ|q⟩
2|q|
,
ǫµ+ = ⟨¯q|γµ|¯q⟩
2|q|
.
(F.7)
One can verify that these polarization vectors reproduce the Landau gauge propagator given
by eq. (B.1), i.e. that
∆µν = ǫ−
µ ǫ+
ν
(F.8)
We also note that these polarization vectors can also be used for pure massive Yang-Mills,
where we now sum over two possible modes to ﬁnd
∆Y M

(F.9)
The polarization vector of a massless Yang-Mills ﬁeld is given in [7] as
ǫµ = ⟨q|γµ|η⟩
⟨qη⟩
.
(F.10)
This could in principle be used to construct x-variables for massless ﬁelds coupled to conserved
currents, which would then be of the form
x1 = ⟨q|u1|η⟩
⟨qη⟩
.

Graviton vs Dilaton Exchange in General Dimensions
For a gravitational theory in D dimensions, [κ2
D] = [GD] = 2 −D. However, the graviton has
massless degrees of freedom D(D−3)
2
and massive d.o.f D(D−1)
2
−1 [65]. Thus, for D = 3 we
ﬁnd that [G] = −1, that there are no massless gravitons and that massive gravitons have two
degrees of freedom. In general dimensions, the massless dilaton polarization tensor is of the
form
ǫd(q)µν =
1
√
D −2 (ηµν −qµην −qνηµ) ,
(G.1)
– 24 –

where ηµ is an auxiliary vector that satisﬁes η · q = 1 and η2 = 0. For a massive dilaton, the
polarization tensor is given by
Ed(q)µν =

(G.2)
In this section, we will compare dilaton exchange amplitudes with actual graviton exchange
amplitudes in general dimensions.
Two scalars exchanging a massless graviton in D-dimensional general relativity is given by
the amplitude

where the vertices and propagator are given by eqs. (B.4) and (4.11) respectively.

For a massive gravity in D dimensions, we ﬁnd an amplitude of the form

We see then that the massive graviton does have a Newtonian like classical limit in D = 3,
unlike the massless graviton. Furthermore, we notice that this amplitude is non-zero even if
we take D →3 and the mass of the graviton to zero — a manifestation of the well known
vDVZ discontinuity. In fact, we see that taking M →0 gives rise to an overall factor diﬀerence
of (D −3)/(D −2) vs (D −2)/(D −1) when comparing the strictly massless graviton and the
massless limit of the massive graviton, which reproduces the four-dimensional factor of 2/3
[26, 83].
Equally, we ﬁnd that the massive dilaton will similarly produce a potential, since the massive
dilaton exchange amplitude is given by
