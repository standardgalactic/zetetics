The task being undertaken can influence orthographic, phonological and semantic processes. In linguistic 
research, two tasks are most often used: a task requiring a decision in relation to the presented word and a 
passive reading task which does not require a decision regarding the presented word. The results of studies using 
these different tasks are not always consistent. This study aimed to explore brain responses associated with the 
process of recognition of spelling errors, as well as the influence of the task on this process. Event-related po­
tentials (ERPs) were recorded in 40 adults during an orthographic decision task to determine correctly spelled 
words and words written with errors that did not change the phonology and during the passive reading. During 
spelling recognition, the early stages up to 100 ms after the stimulus were automatic and did not depend on the 
requirements of the task. The amplitude of the N1 component (90–160 ms) was greater in the orthographic 
decision task, but did not depend on the correct spelling of the word. Late word recognition after 350–500 ms 
was task dependent, but spelling effects were similar across the two tasks: misspelled words evoked an increase in 
the amplitude of the N400 component related to lexical and semantic processing regardless of the task. In 
addition, the orthographic decision task modulated spelling effects, this was reflected in an increase in the 
amplitude of the P2 component (180–260 ms) for correctly spelled words compared with misspelled words. Thus, 
our results show that spelling recognition involves general lexico-semantic processes independent of the task. 
Simultaneously, the orthographic decision task modulates the spelling-specific processes necessary to quickly 
detect conflicts between orthographic and phonological representations of words in memory.   
1. Introduction 
Misspelled words occur in all writing systems. The type of 
misspelling produced is influenced by the writing system, reading skills, 
and the spelling tasks (Limpo et al., 2021). However, regardless of the 
writing system, many misspelled words tend to be phonologically 
similar to correctly spelled words. Indeed, pseudohomophones, that is, 
non-words that sound the same as words (for example, the pseudoho­
mophone “brane” for the word “brain” in English), can be a type of 
natural spelling error. For example, in Russian, all words with errors in 
the unstressed vowels are pseudohomophones: the pronunciation of the 
correctly spelled word “решение” (“decision”), in which the first syllable 
is unstressed, and the misspelled word “ришение” (incorrect spelling of 
the word “решение”) is the same [rʲɪ′ʂεnʲɪje]. Therefore, studies on the 
recognition of pseudohomophones are closest to the study of spelling 
errors. Neurophysiological studies of pseudohomophones1 sometimes 
use the silent reading paradigm (Araújo et al., 2015; Kem´eny et al., 
2018; Larionova & Martynova, 2022; Sauseng et al., 2004; Vissers et al., 
2006). But more often, they use the lexical decision task wherein the 
subject needs to determine which stimulus is a word and which is not 
(Braun et al., 2009; Briesemeister et al., 2009; Costello et al., 2021; 
Gonz´alez-Garrido et al., 2014, 2015), or similar tasks such as the 
phonological lexical decision task (Bakos et al., 2018; Hasko et al., 
2013), where it is necessary to make a decision about the correspon­
dence of the sound of the stimulus to the word, or the orthographic 
decision task (Taha & Khateb, 2013), when it is necessary to make a 
decision on the correct spelling of the word. The spelling decision task is 
probably the most suitable for studying the processes associated with 
determining the correct spelling of a word since it gives direct instruc­
tion to determine the correct spelling of each stimulus. Nevertheless, the 
silent reading task is closer to the natural reading process than a lexical 
decision task since we usually read without making any decision (Chen 
et al., 2015), which may be why some authors believe that it is better 
suited for research on visual word recognition (Bermúdez-Margaretto,

Beltr´an, et al., 2020; Blythe et al., 2020). In addition, the use of such a 
task makes it possible to understand whether the differentiation of 
misspelled words and correctly spelled words occurs automatically. 
The results obtained in studies with pseudohomophones are not al­
ways consistent: in some studies, differences between words and pseu­
dohomophones were observed at about 100–200 ms (ERP components 
P100, P150, N170) after the presentation of stimuli (Araújo et al., 2015; 
Braun et al., 2009; Gonz´alez-Garrido et al., 2015; Sauseng et al., 2004), 
however in others differences were observed much later, in the N400 
component and the P600 component following it. It was shown that the 
amplitude of the N400 component is larger for pseudohomophones than 
for words (Briesemeister et al., 2009; Gonz´alez-Garrido et al., 2015; 
Hasko et al., 2013; Vissers et al., 2006), and the P600 component has 
been shown to both increase (Van de Meerendonk et al., 2011), and 
decrease (Bakos et al., 2018) in amplitude for pseudohomophones 
compared to words. This may indicate that spelling recognition can 
occur both early, at the stages associated with sublexical and lexical 
processing, and later at the stages of lexico-semantic processing. How­
ever, the differences in the research paradigms may be the reason for the 
conflicting results. In addition, it is still unclear at what stage the task's 
requirements affect the processing of verbal information. 
The influence of the task on the N400 and P600 components is noted 
in a number of linguistic studies (Bornkessel-Schlesewsky & Schlesew­
sky, 2008; Brouwer & Crocker, 2017; Kolk et al., 2003; Schacht et al., 
2014). Kolk et al., used two paradigms: in the first task, participants had 
to identify grammatically incorrect and semantically implausible sen­
tences; in the second task, subjects read these sentences, and after pre­
senting 20 % of the sentences answered questions about their content 
(Kolk et al., 2003). In the first experiment, they found that semantically 
implausible combinations of words (for example, “the trees that played 
in the park…”) caused N400/P600 effects, and in the second, only an 
N400 effect, so the authors conclude that the most common linguistic 
function P600 is a monitoring or verification function (Kolk et al., 2003). 
This assumption is consistent with the results of Van de Meerendonk 
et al. (2011), who showed an increase in the P600 amplitude for spelling 
violations in words compared to correctly spelled words during passive 
sentence reading followed by questions about their content, which, ac­
cording to the authors, reflects reprocessing to check for possible pro­
cessing errors. Interestingly, in the phonological decision task, the 
opposite results were obtained (Bakos et al., 2018), which may be due to 
the fact that in this task, rechecking is required to a lesser extent since 
pseudohomophones also sound like words. 
The N400 component is traditionally associated with lexico-semantic 
processing, which can be modulated by task conditions (Kiefer & 
Brendel, 2006; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Kutas & Hillyard, 1989). The 
effect of N400 during the lexical decision task with masked semantic 
priming was smaller when this task was preceded by a perceptual task, 
but not when preceded by a semantic task, which, on the contrary, 
enhanced this effect (Kiefer & Martens, 2010). The authors explained 
these results using their own model, according to which attentional 
mechanisms optimize unconscious information processing depending on 
the goals of the task being performed; that is, unconscious semantic 
processing was enhanced by the semantic task and weakened by the 
perceptual task (Kiefer & Martens, 2010). Similar results on the effect of 
the task on the semantic processing of words and the N400 effect were 
obtained in another study, while for the early negative wave N200 no 
effect of the task was found, which, according to the authors, indicates 
the independence of early automatic semantic processing from task re­
quirements (Marí-Beffa et al., 2005). Brown and colleagues showed that 
in the lexical decision task, the amplitude of N400 is modulated by the 
proportion of semantically related and unrelated pairs of words, while 
during silent reading, there is no such modulation; the amplitude of 
N400 for semantically unrelated target words is greater than the 
amplitude for related words in both tasks (Brown et al., 2000). Ac­
cording to some authors, this may indicate the existence of various 
priming mechanisms: automatic priming and controlled priming, which 
are associated with expectation (Brown et al., 2000; Silva-Pereyra et al., 
2003). Accordingly, the N400 component, according to some authors, is 
sensitive to both automatic and controlled processing components 
(Kiefer & Brendel, 2006; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Kutas & Hillyard, 
1989). Meade et al. (2019) found orthographic neighborhood effects 
associated with the N400 component for words in both the lexical de­
cision task and the letter search task, but the N400 neighborhood effect 
for pseudowords has only been found in the lexical decision task. The 
authors suggested that the neighborhood effect for words is due to 
automatic word recognition processes, while the neighborhood effect for 
pseudowords is associated with a task-specific process of enhancing 
global lexical activity for making a lexical decision (Meade et al., 2019). 
Unfortunately, a comparison of the modulation of the N400 component 
for pseudohomophones in different paradigms has not been made 
before. However, in general, an increase in the amplitude of the N400 
for pseudohomophones than for words is most commonly found in 
studies (e.g., Briesemeister et al., 2009; Gonz´alez-Garrido et al., 2015; 
Hasko et al., 2013; Larionova & Martynova, 2022; Vissers et al., 2006), 
suggesting that it is independent of the paradigm used. 
There is evidence that a task can modulate not only the lexico- 
semantic but also the phonological processes necessary to perform a 
specific task (e.g., Barnea & Breznitz, 1998; Chen et al., 2015). For 
example, Barnea and Breznitz (1998) found an increase in the latency 
and amplitude of the P200 and N400 components during a phonological 
task (rhyme-nonrhyme decision task) compared to a spelling task 
(orthographic similarity decision task). Chen et al. (2013) using EEG/ 
MEG and fMRI, found a task effect 150 ms after word presentation, 
greater activation of the left precentral areas was observed during the 
silent reading task than during lexical decision tasks, which the authors 
attribute to increased phonological activation during silent reading 
compared to the lexical decision task. In addition, depending on the 
task, the topography of the components may also differ: N350 was 
highest in the left frontal area in the phonological task (to assess whether 
pairs of words rhyme), in contrast to the semantic task (to assess 
whether pairs of words are semantically related), in which this 
component had a two-sided distribution, while N150 did not differ be­
tween these tasks (Spironelli & Angrilli, 2007). 
Despite the traditional view that the early stages of word recognition 
are automatic and independent of task requirements (Herdman & Takai, 
2013), task-related top-down processes have been shown to influence 
the early stages of verbal information processing at 250 ms after the 
stimulus (Chen et al., 2015; Faísca et al., 2019; Strijkers et al., 2015; 
Wang & Maurer, 2017). During the implicit reading task, in which 
subjects had to press a button when stimuli were repeated and there was 
no instruction to read words, N1 had a larger amplitude for correctly 
spelled word stimuli than for pseudowords, but during reading aloud 
this modulation of N1 was absent – the amplitude for words and pseu­
dowords did not differ (Faísca et al., 2019). Strikers and colleagues 
showed that the word frequency effect appeared as early as 120 ms after 
stimulus presentation in the semantic categorization task but only 220 
ms after stimulus presentation in the font color categorization task, 
where linguistic processing is not required (Strijkers et al., 2015). In 
addition, other work showed that more pronounced early frequency 
effects (an increase in N170 amplitude) were observed in the lexical 
decision task than during silent reading (Chen et al., 2015). Thus, the 
task may also influence early lexical effects. 
Task modulation of brain responses in spelling error recognition has 
not previously been studied. At the same time, data from neurophysio­
logical studies on the ERP components associated with pseudohomo­
phone processing remain contradictory, which may be due to a task 
influence. There are studies showing that the task can influence ortho­
graphic, phonological, and semantic processes. The process of spelling 
recognition may be associated with all these processes. The purpose of 
this work is to study top-down modulation of the dynamics of recogni­
tion of correctly spelled words and misspelled words. For this, we 
analyzed the ERP components associated with various stages of word

processing. As stimuli, we used words with real errors in the Russian 
language, which are pseudohomophones. We hypothesize that an 
orthographic decision task, in which the subject is required to determine 
the correct spelling of a word, influences the processes associated with 
recognition of the correct spelling and enhances spelling effects 
compared to the passive reading task, this should be reflected in earlier 
differences in brain responses. If the recognition of spelling errors occurs 
automatically, then the effects associated with recognition of correct 
spelling will be the same regardless of the task. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Participants 
Forty healthy volunteers participated in the study (25 women and 15 
men). The subjects were right-handed 20 to 35 year old native Russian 
speakers without speech disorders, neurological diseases, or psychiatric 
diseases, and had normal or corrected to normal vision. The average age 
of the subjects was 26.2 (SD 5.2) years; the average level of education 
was 14.7 (SD 1.6) years in education. The study was carried out in 
compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the study 
was approved by the Ethics Committee, before the start of the experi­
ment, all subjects signed informed consent to participate in the study. 
2.2. Stimuli 
All stimuli were nouns spelled with or without orthographic errors, 
that consisted of 5–7 letters; only one error was allowed in misspelled 
words. There were two sets of stimuli (a complete list of the stimuli and 
their characteristics is provided in Appendix). Examples and charac­
teristics for each set of stimuli are presented in Table 1. It is important to 
note that the misspelled words sound the same as correctly spelled 
words; that is, they are pseudohomophones. The stimuli in each set were 
composed in such a way that among them there were words of different 
frequencies of occurrence, as determined by a word frequency dictio­
nary (Lyashevskaya & Sharov, 2009). Word frequency, word length, and 
the orthographic neighborhood size did not differ significantly for the 
two categories of stimuli and between sets (Student's t-test, p > 0.05). 
Spelling errors were predominantly in the first syllable: for the Set 1, 
there were 8 words in which the error was in the second syllable; for the 
Set 2, there were 13 words with an error in the second syllable. One type 
of spelling error was used – errors in unstressed vowels, as this is a 
common type of error in Russian. Correctly spelled words also contained 
an unstressed vowel, but it was spelled correctly. 
2.3. Procedure 
During the experiment, participants sat in a darkened room in a 
comfortable chair at a distance of about 1 m from the monitor. Stimuli 
were presented in random order on a 19-inch LG FLATRON L1952T 
monitor using the PsychoPy Experiment Builder v3.0.7 software (Peirce 
et al., 2019). The stimuli were written in white Liberation Sans on a 
black background, font size 125 pt. 
The volunteers had to complete two tasks (the passive reading task 
and the orthographic decision task); the total duration of the tasks did 
not exceed 20 min, including short breaks. The order of tasks was fixed: 
the reading task, then the orthographic decision task. This task order 
was chosen to avoid intentional spelling recognition in a reading task in 
which subjects were only asked to read words silently. Each task used a 
different but well-controlled set of stimuli because processing the same 
stimuli twice could induce a bias and affect the associated neural re­
sponses. Two sets of stimuli alternated between tasks: 26 participants 
received set 1 in the reading task and set 2 in the orthographic decision 
task; 14 participants received set 2 in the reading task and set 1 in the 
orthographic decision task. 
In the passive reading task, the subjects were asked to silently read 
the words presented on the screen: 47 words misspelled in an unstressed 
vowel and 46 correctly spelled words with an unstressed vowel. The 
presentation time was 300 ms; the interstimulus interval varied 
randomly from 1500 to 2200 ms. 
In the orthographic decision task, the subjects were asked to deter­
mine whether there is an error in the word or not. This task required a 
motor response. The motor response was performed using a Logitech 
F310 gamepad by pressing the left and right shoulder buttons. The in­
struction for one half of the participants was as follows: “If there is a 
mistake in the word, press the right button. If there is no mistake in the 
word, press the left button.” The instruction for the other half of the 
participants was as follows: “If there is a mistake in the word, press the 
left button. If there is no mistake in the word, press the right button.” 
The number of stimuli was the same as in the first task: 47 words mis­
spelled in an unstressed vowel and 46 correctly spelled words with an 
unstressed vowel. The presentation time was 300 ms; the interstimulus 
interval was counted from the motor response and varied randomly from 
1500 to 2200 ms. If there was no response within 5000 ms, the next 
stimulus was presented. 
2.4. EEG data acquisition and analysis 
EEG was recorded using the Encephalan amplifier (Medicom, Russia) 
from 19 electrodes: Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, C3, C4, T3, T4, T5, T6, P3, 
P4, O1, O2, Fz, Cz, Pz, arranged in a 10-20 system. The monopolar 
ipsilateral design of EEG recording was used with reference electrodes 
placed on the mastoids. The sampling rate was 250 Hz. The impedance 
did not exceed 10 kΩ. The event-related potentials were processed using 
the Brain Vision Analyzer 2.0.4 software (Brain Products, GmbH, 
Munich, Germany), including 0.5–30 Hz pre-filtering and removal of

artifacts using independent component analysis. ERPs were averaged 
separately for each type of stimulus in each task within a time window of 
300 ms before stimulus presentation and 1500 ms after. The incorrect 
trials in the orthographic decision task were not discarded from the ERP 
analysis: firstly, in this way, we equalized the number of averagings in 
the two compared tasks, and secondly, in order to equalize the experi­
mental conditions, in the reading task we did not control task perfor­
mance. The minimum number of stimuli for averaging was 40 words. 
To determine the time intervals for the analysis of the main com­
ponents of the ERPs in the two tasks, we calculated the global field 
power (global field power, Fig. 1), which allowed us to choose the 
optimal periods of stable topography (Lehmann & Skrandies, 1980). The 
main peaks were observed in the intervals 70–90 ms (approximately 
corresponding to the parietal-occipital-temporal component of P1), 
90–160 ms (approximately corresponding to the parietal-occipital- 
temporal component of N1), 180–260 ms (approximately correspond­
ing to the P2 component, which had a wide topography), 350–750 ms 
(approximately corresponding to the N400 component, as well as the 
P600 following it, so this interval was divided into two – 350-500 ms and 
500–750 ms) (Fig. 1). 
Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using the STATISTICA 
8 software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). Analysis of variance with repeated

measures (RM ANOVA) was applied to the mean ERP amplitude for each 
region of interest in each time window. The electrodes were divided into 
9 regions of interest: left anterior region (Fp1, F3, F7), middle anterior 
region (Fz), right anterior region (Fp2, F4, F8), left central region (T3, 
C3), central region (Cz), right central region (T4, C4), left posterior re­
gion (T5, P3, O1), posterior central region (Pz), and right posterior re­
gion (T6, P4, O2). We averaged the ERP amplitude across the electrodes 
in each region of interest. The analysis of variance included the 
following factors: task (2 levels: passive reading and orthographic de­
cision task), spelling (2 levels: correctly spelled words and misspelled 
words), laterality (3 levels: left, right, and middle line of electrodes) and 
electrode position (3 levels: anterior, central, and posterior). In addition, 
we used a Set of stimuli (Set 1 and Set 2) as a factor in the statistical 
model. If the observed effect interacted with the Set factor, this effect 
was not discussed further. 
Since the P1 and N1 components, in contrast to the P2, N400 and 
P600 components with a wide topography, are localized in the parie­
tooccipitotemporal regions (Fig. 1), only two regions of interest were 
included in the analysis of variance for these components: the left and 
right posterior regions, similarly to other studies that have examined 
these components (e.g., Faísca et al., 2019; Maurer et al., 2005). We 
were interested in the effects of task and spelling, as well as their 
interaction with other factors. When determining the reliability of the 
effects, the Greenhouse-Geiser correction was taken into account. The 
Bonferroni correction was used for post hoc analysis. Partial eta squared 
(η2p) was applied as a measure of effect size. 
3. Results 
The topography of all studied ERP components, with the exception of 
the P600 wave, was similar in the two tasks (Fig. 1). Examples of average 
ERPs are shown in Fig. 2. 
The results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. 
No significant effects were found for the 70–90 ms (P1) time 
window. 
The main effect of Task was significant for the 90–160 ms (N1) time 
window F(1, 38) = 30.10, p = 0.000003, η2
p = 0.44: the N1 amplitude 
was more negative in the orthographic decision task than in the passive 
reading task. 
The main effect of Spelling was significant for the 180–260 ms (P2) 
time window F(1, 38) = 6.38, p = 0.02, η2
p = 0.14: the P2 amplitude was 
more positive for correctly spelled words than for misspelled words. In 
addition, we observed significant interaction of the factors Task ×
Spelling: F(1, 38) = 4.22, p = 0.04, η2
p = 0.10. The post-hoc analysis 
showed that the P2 amplitude was more positive in the reading task 
compared to the orthographic decision task for only misspelled words (p 
= 0.0003) and also that the amplitude for correctly spelled words was 
greater than for misspelled words only in the orthographic task (р =
0.0001). In the same time window, we observed significant interaction 
of the factors Task × Electrode position: F(2, 76) = 8.71, p = 0.0004, η2
p 
= 0.19. The post-hoc analysis showed that the P2 amplitude was larger 
in the reading task compared with the orthographic decision task in the 
parietal-temporal-occipital region (T5, P3, O1, Pz, T6, P4, O2, p =

Task × Electrode position × Laterality: F(4, 152) = 5.56, p = 0.0003, η2
p 
= 0.13. The post-hoc analysis showed that the ERP amplitude in the 
180–260 ms time window in the left frontal region (Fp1/F3/F7, p =
0.04) was greater in the orthographic task than in the reading task; in the 
central (Cz, p < 0.000001), right central (T4, C4, p = 0.02), left posterior 
(T5, P3, O1, p < 0.000001), posterior central (Pz, p < 0.000001), and 
right posterior (T6, P4, O2, p < 0.000001) areas ERP amplitudes were 
larger during reading than during the orthographic task. And finally, we 
observed four-way interaction of the factors Task × Spelling × Electrode

analysis in each area of interest showed a significant interaction of Task 
× Spelling (F(1, 39) = 4.63, p = 0.04, η2

gion. The post-hoc analysis showed that the amplitude for correctly

task (р = 0.003). The main effect of Spelling (F(1, 39) = 4.63, p = 0.02, 
η2
p = 0.14) was found in the left central region: the amplitude for 
correctly spelled words was greater than for misspelled words. In the 
central region, effects of Task (F(1, 39) = 7.16, p = 0.01, η2
p = 0.16, more 
positive P2 amplitude for reading compared to the orthographic task) 
and Spelling (F(1, 39) = 4.31, p = 0.04, η2
p = 0.10, more positive P2 
amplitude for correctly spelled words compared to misspelled words) 
and interaction of Task × Spelling (F(1, 39) = 4.64, p = 0.04, η2
p = 0.11) 
were discovered. The post-hoc analysis showed that the P2 amplitude in 
the central region was more positive in the reading task compared to the 
orthographic decision task for only misspelled words (p = 0.0001) and 
also that the amplitude for correctly spelled words was greater than for 
misspelled words only in the orthographic task (р = 0.0001). The main 
effect of Task (F(1, 39) = 32.78, p = 0.000001, η2
p = 0.46) was found in 
the left posterior region: the P2 amplitude was greater during reading 
than during the orthographic task. In the posterior central region, effects 
of Task (F(1, 39) = 6.39, p = 0.01, η2
p = 0.14, more positive P2 amplitude 
for reading compared to the orthographic task) and Spelling (F(1, 39) =
4.16, p = 0.04, η2
p = 0.10, more positive P2 amplitude for correctly 
spelled words compared to misspelled words) were discovered. The 
main effect of Task (F(1, 39) = 37.01, p = 0.000001, η2
p = 0.49) was also 
observed in the right posterior region, where post hoc analysis showed 
that the P2 amplitude was greater during reading than during the 
orthographic decision task. 
In the 350–500 ms (N400) time window, the main effect of Task (F(1, 
38) = 34.24, p = 0.000001, η2
p = 0.47) was significant: a more negative 
wave was observed in the reading task than in the orthographic decision 
task. In addition, we identified the main effect of Spelling (F(1, 38) =
4.21, p = 0.04, η2
p = 0.10): a more negative wave was observed for 
misspelled words than for correctly spelled words. In the same time 
window, we observed significant interaction of the factors Task ×
Electrode position: F(2, 76) = 5.40, p = 0.006, η2
p = 0.12. The post-hoc 
analysis showed that the N400 amplitude was more negative in the 
reading task compared with the orthographic decision task in the 
anterior region (Fp1, F3, F7, Fz, Fp2, F4, F8, p < 0.000001), in the 
central region (T3, C3, Cz, T4, C4, p < 0.000001) and in the posterior 
region (T5, P3, O1, Pz, T6, P4, O2, p < 0.000001). For significant 
interaction of Task × Laterality (F(2, 76) = 36.65, p = 0.000001, η2
p =
0.49), post-hoc analysis showed that a more negative wave was observed 
in the reading task than in the orthographic decision task in the left (Fp1, 
F3, F7, T3, C3, T5, P3, O1, p < 0.000001), central (Fz, Cz, Pz, p <
0.000001), and right (Fp2, F4, F8, T4, C4, T6, P4, O2, p < 0.000001) 
electrodes. And finally, we observed a significant interaction of Task ×
Electrode position × Laterality: F(4, 152) = 2.52, p = 0.04, η2
p = 0.06. 
The post-hoc analysis showed that a more negative wave was observed 
in the reading task than in the orthographic decision task in all leads (p 
< 0.000001). 
In the 500–750 ms (P600) time window, significant interaction of 
Task × Electrode position × Laterality (F(4, 152) = 3.52, p = 0.009, η2
p 
= 0.18) was discovered. The post-hoc analysis showed that the ampli­
tude in the left anterior region (Fp1/F3/F7, p = 0.002) and middle 
anterior region (Fz, p = 0.0004) was more positive in the reading task 
than in the orthographic decision task, but in the central (T3/C3, p =
0.0003; Cz, p < 0.000001; T4/C4, p = 0.001) and posterior (T5/P3/O1, 
p < 0.000001; Pz, p < 0.000001; T6/P4/O2, p < 0.000001) areas was 
more positive in the orthographic decision task than in the reading task. 
4. Discussion 
Prior ERP experiments have shown that task may modulate brain 
responses and some processes in word recognition. In the present study, 
we investigated the influence of task on the ERP components associated 
with the recognition of the correctness of spelled words. ERP results

show an influence of the task on almost all stages of the processing of 
verbal information. The orthographic decision task modulated the 
spelling effects in a 180–260 ms time window, corresponding to the P2 
component. First, we observed an increase in the amplitude of the P2 
component in the left frontal area for correctly spelled words in the 
orthographic task versus the reading task. Second, we showed an in­
crease in the amplitude of the P2 component in the central region on 
correctly spelled words over words written with an error. 
At the earliest time epoch of analysis (70–90 ms), related to P1, we 
found no effect of the task on brain responses. The P1 component is 
associated with the analysis of the physical parameters of the stimulus, 
but it can also be connected with early attentional processes (Araújo 
et al., 2015; Klimesch, 2011; Proverbio & Zani, 2003). In addition, this 
stage is associated with sublexical processes and ERP studies have shown 
that the P1 component of ERPs was larger for atypical letter combina­
tions than typical ones when the physical parameters of the stimuli did 
not differ (Araújo et al., 2015; Coch & Mitra, 2010; Hauk et al., 2006). In 
our study, the physical parameters of the stimuli (color, size, orientation, 
screen position) were the same in the two tasks, and the amplitude of the 
P1 component did not differ during the reading task nor during the 
orthographic decision task. Similar results have been obtained in other 
studies. For instance, when comparing a task in which subjects had to 
pay attention to the repetition of verbal stimuli and the task of reading 
aloud, the effect of the task for the P1 component was absent, but was 
observed for the later N1 (Faísca et al., 2019). When comparing word 
and pseudoword reading aloud and the lexical decision task for the same 
stimuli, no differences were found in the topography and amplitude of 
the P1 component, so the authors conclude that very early low-level 
visual processes are common to both tasks (Mah´e et al., 2015). When 
processing correctly spelled words and misspelled words, the early 
sublexical stages up to 100 ms are probably automatic and do not 
depend on the task's requirements. 
For the other early wave (90–160 ms), our results indicate a signif­
icant task effect: the negative N1 wave was greater in the orthographic 
decision task than in the reading task. On one hand, this result corrob­
orates the findings of a great deal of previous work showing that the 
amplitude of the N170 (or N1) component can be modulated by selective 
attention (e.g., Aranda et al., 2010; Hillyard & Anllo-Vento, 1998; 
Yoncheva et al., 2015). On the other hand, it cannot be ignored that the 
N1 component is primarily associated with orthographic processing, 
which involves visual analysis of words, it depends on the experience of 
perceiving letters, letter combinations and words (Bentin et al., 1999; 
Faísca et al., 2019; Maurer et al., 2005; Pleisch et al., 2019). In well-read 
adults, the N1 component, which is the electrophysiological correlate of 
visual word form area activation, may reflect the search for orthographic 
representations in the lexicon (Araújo et al., 2015). Experienced readers 
showed an increase in the amplitude of this component for words versus 
non-words, for familiar versus unfamiliar words, and for strings of let­
ters versus strings of less familiar characters (Carreiras et al., 2014; Coch 
& Mitra, 2010; Mah´e et al., 2012; S´anchez-Vincitore et al., 2017; Xue 
et al., 2019). That is, this component differentiates various orthographic 
stimuli and is one of the early markers of word recognition. It should be 
noted that in all the aforementioned studies showing differences in 
amplitude of the N1 component, tasks requiring a decision in relation to 
the presented stimuli were used. However, neither in the orthographic 
decision task nor in the reading task did we find any differentiation 
between correctly spelled words and misspelled words. This may indi­
cate the difficulty of differentiating these correctly spelled and mis­
spelled words even by adult native speakers, as opposed to 
differentiating words from pseudo-words or words from non-words. 
Indeed, misspelled words, unlike pseudowords, have a semantic mean­
ing, and, unlike non-words, contain legitimate combinations of letters, 
which probably makes early recognition difficult. In addition, as we 
often encounter misspelled words in written language, these alternative 
forms of words generate their own mental representations which are 
stored simultaneously in the mental lexicon (see review by Ernestus, 
2014). It can be assumed that an increase in the amplitude of N1 in the 
orthographic decision task is modulated by attention and reflects the 
depth of orthographic processing of all categories of stimuli. At the same 
time, given the complexity of stimulus differentiation and the probable 
competition of mental representations for correctly and incorrectly 
spelled words, recognition of the spelling of words does occur this 
quickly. However, a more detailed analysis of each presented word and 
optimization of preattentive information processing for further spelling 
recognition can also occur, which is reflected in the increase in the 
amplitude of N1 in the orthographic decision task. 
In the following epoch of analysis (180–260 ms, corresponding to the 
P2 component), we found both the spelling effect and the interaction 
between the spelling effect and the task effect. At the same time, further 
analysis revealed differences between correctly spelled words and mis­
spelled words only in the orthographic decision task. Moreover, 
although in some areas of interest (left central, central, posterior central 
regions) the main spelling effect was observed, in the left anterior and 
central areas, spelling effects were observed only in the orthographic 
decision task. Therefore, we supposed that the orthographic decision 
task predominantly modulated the spelling effect. The P2 component is 
associated with the extraction of orthographic and phonological features 
of words, that is, with the processes of decoding a grapheme into a 
phoneme (Barnea & Breznitz, 1998; Carreiras et al., 2005; Dambacher 
et al., 2006; S´anchez-Vincitore et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021). Sauseng 
et al. (2004) reported an increased amplitude of the positive wave in the 
frontal regions 160 ms after the presentation of words when compared 
with pseudohomophones using the silent reading task followed by 
questions after some stimuli and the requirement to read them aloud, 
which could modulate differentiation processes, this increase was 
compatible with data obtained using the lexical decision task (Braun 
et al., 2009). These data are consistent with our results for the ortho­
graphic decision task on the material of words with spelling errors, 
which are similar to pseudohomophones. Braun et al. (2009) consider 
the P150 component (similar to the P2 component in our study) as the 
brain's response to the conflict between orthographic and phonological 
memory representations. There is no such conflict for words, and in the 
case of pseudohomophones there is no orthographic representation in 
memory, which leads to a decrease in the amplitude of the positive wave 
as early as 150 ms (P150) after stimulus onset (Braun et al., 2009). This 
observation partly explains our finding of decreased P2 for misspelled 
words: although they may have orthographic representations in mem­
ory, these representations are less robust than those for words, so there 
may also be a conflict and the orthographic decision task predominantly 
modulated spelling error detection at the stage of the P2 component. 
However, the spelling effect can also be found in the reading task, but 
less strong than in the decision task. A similar spelling effect for the P2 
component was observed in another study using the reading task; 
however, the P2 amplitude was grater for correctly than for incorrectly 
spelled words only in the left temporo-parieto-occipital region (Lar­
ionova & Martynova, 2022). In addition, in contrast to the present study, 
in the work of Larionova and Martynova (2022) a shorter stimulus 
presentation time of 200 ms and a larger number of stimuli were used, 
which could have contributed to some of the discrepancy in the results. 
In addition to the spelling effect for the P2 component, a task effect 
was identified: the P2 amplitude in the left frontal region was greater in 
the orthographic decision task compared with the reading task, and in 
the central and parietal-temporal-occipital regions it was greater during 
the reading task than in the orthographic decision task. Although we did 
not localize the source due to the small number of electrodes, it can be 
assumed that these amplitude-topographic differences in the P2 
component reflect processes specific to each task. Only a few neuro­
imaging studies have examined the effect of task on visual word 
recognition processes. In one of these studies comparing the lexical 
decision task and the silent reading task without any motor response 
using EEG/MEG and fMRI, Chen et al., found that task effects occurred 
at around 150 ms, with more activation for reading compared to a 
E. Larionova et al.

lexical decision task in precentral gyrus, as well as more activation for 
the lexical decision task compared to the reading task in left inferior 
temporal cortex and right anterior middle temporal gyrus (Chen et al., 
2013). The authors attribute these differences in activation to more 
emphasis on early retrieval of phonological information in silent reading 
than in the lexical decision task (Chen et al., 2013). It is important to 
note that in Chen's experiment, only words were used in the reading 
task, and in the lexical decision task, words and pseudowords that are 
clearly phonologically different from words were used, while in our 
study we used correctly spelled words and misspelled words that are 
phonologically similar to words (in two tasks). In studies using pseu­
dohomophones, both in silent reading and in the task of lexical decision, 
activation was indeed noted in the region of the left inferior frontal 
gyrus and the left precentral gyrus (Edwards et al., 2005; Wheat et al., 
2010). Therefore, we assume that phonological processes may be 
involved in both tasks at this stage. However, the increased P2 ampli­
tude in the frontal regions during the orthographic decision task 
compared to the reading task may be associated with both general dif­
ferences in attention and modulation of the task-specific process of 
detecting a conflict between orthography and phonology to determine 
the correct spelling of words. At the same time, the increase in the P2 
amplitude in the posterior regions during the reading task, as well as the 
spelling effect found in another study in the visual word form area 
during reading (Larionova & Martynova, 2022) may indicate processes 
predominantly associated with the recognition of the spelling of the 
whole word, which are similar to those observed in the 90–160 ms time 
window in the orthographic decision task, but do not always result in the 
recognition of correctly spelled words. 
In our study, misspelled words elicited a larger N400 component 
than correctly spelled words between 350 and 500 ms for both the 
orthographic decision task and the reading task. It is believed that a 
decrease in N400 amplitude may reflect easier access to lexico-semantic 
information (Almeida, 2021; Kutas & Federmeier, 2000; Lau et al., 2009; 
Meade et al., 2019). The amplitude of N400 has been shown to be larger 
for pseudowords than words, and this effect has been identified in 
various paradigms – semantic categorization (Coch & Benoit, 2015), the 
lexical decision task (Braun et al., 2006; Carreiras et al., 2005), the silent 
reading task (Bermúdez-Margaretto, Shtyrov, et al., 2020), the pro­
nounceability judgment task (Tzeng et al., 2017). In addition, the N400 
wave is associated with phonological processing and is traditionally 
considered in works with pseudohomophones, in which a less negative 
wave reflects higher activation of a particular phonological represen­
tation (Barnea & Breznitz, 1998; Briesemeister et al., 2009; Costello 
et al., 2021; Gonz´alez-Garrido et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2021). The few 
studies using misspelled words as stimuli showed results similar to ours: 
N400 was more negative for misspelled words compared to correctly 
spelled words in the lexical decision task (Gonz´alez-Garrido et al., 
2015), in the orthographic decision task (Heldmann et al., 2017), and in 
the reading task (Larionova & Martynova, 2022). According to some 
authors, the amplitude of N400 reflects the amount of effort required to 
integrate orthographic, phonological and semantic information during 
lexical processing (Grainger & Holcomb, 2009), and the increase in the 
amplitude of N400 for pseudohomophones is associated with a conflict 
between orthographic and phonological representations, which makes 
integration difficult (Briesemeister et al., 2009). We found that, 
regardless of the task, the N400 amplitude for misspelled words was 
more negative than for correctly spelled words. This is consistent with 
the results of other studies and suggests that spelling recognition 
occurred regardless of the requirements of the task. Kutas and Feder­
meier (2011) described in their review that the N400 includes the 
characteristics of both automatic and controlled processing. Our results 
indicate that recognition of the correct spelling of words in the time 
window corresponding to the N400 component occurs automatically. 
This probably means that spelling recognition involves lexico-semantic 
and phonological processes regardless of the task. It is noteworthy 
that we showed that the N400 amplitude was greater during passive 
reading than during the orthographic decision task regardless of the type 
of stimulus. On one hand, a decrease in the amplitude of N400 in the 
orthographic decision task may reflect easier access to lexico-semantic 
and phonological information at this stage, including due to the mod­
ulation of earlier components of evoked potentials. That is, despite the 
independence of the spelling recognition process, top-down modulation 
of the N400 amplitude can take place. On the other hand, we must take 
into account subtle differences between the procedures in relation to 
response preparation (the presence of a motor response only in the 
orthographic decision task, the absence of a response in the reading 
task), which can affect the processing of stimuli in the later stages of 
processing. 
We have shown that the P600 amplitude is more positive in the 
orthographic decision task in the central and posterior areas, in contrast 
to the reading task, in which a negative wave was still observed in these 
areas in the 500–750 ms time window. It is known that the P600 
component strongly depends on the task: if the task does not require an 
assessment of acceptability or plausibility, then this leads to a weak­
ening of the P600 amplitude in centro-parietal areas (Kolk et al., 2003; 
Schacht et al., 2014). For example, in Gunter and Friederici's (1999), 
sentences with verb form violations produced P600 effect in the gram­
matical task, but in a task in which participants assessed whether a word 
in a sentence was capitalized (the shallow processing condition), the 
P600 component was significantly reduced (Gunter & Friederici, 1999). 
Schacht et al. (2014) did not observe the parietal component of P600 in a 
task in which participants assessed whether a control word was present 
in a sentence, in contrast to the task of assessing the correctness of a 
sentence, so the authors concluded that P600 depends on attention to 
the context of sentences. The function of the P600 effects as sensitivity to 
word structure is also applicable not only to tasks with sentences but also 
to tasks with single words (Gao et al., 2022). The orthographic task in 
our study required both assessment of correctness and attention to both 
types of presented stimuli, in contrast to the reading task, which prob­
ably explains the increase in the P600 central parietal positive wave in 
the orthographic decision task. 
It is important to note the topographic differences of P600 in the two 
tasks (Figs. 1–2). We observed P600 with an anterior distribution in the 
reading task and P600 with a central-posterior distribution in the 
orthographic decision task. There is the suggestion that the P600 might 
constitute a family of functionally dissociable components with different 
in distribution (Friederici et al., 2002; Leckey & Federmeier, 2020). In a 
study by Friederici and colleagues, the repair-related P600 for sentences 
containing a syntactic violation displayed a centroparietal distribution, 
whereas the complexity-related P600 for sentences of different syntactic 
complexity showed a frontocentral scalp distribution (Friederici et al., 
2002). Hagoort and Brown (2000) observed the P600 consisting of two 
phases: an early phase modulated by integration complexity with a 
relatively equal anterior-posterior distribution and a later phase 
reflecting reanalysis with a strong posterior distribution. Thus, the 
different topography of P600 in two tasks may reflect different func­
tional significance: the anterior P600 in the reading task may reflect 
mainly integration processes for extracting the meaning of the word, and 
the central-posterior P600 in the orthographic decision task may reflect 
predominantly reanalysis processes not required in the reading task. In 
addition, it seems that the P600 in the anterior regions in the two tasks 
has different latency (Fig. 2): P600 in the orthographic decision task is 
earlier than in the reading task, and the beginning of the P600 wave did 
not enter the analyzed epoch of 500–750 ms, that could mean earlier 
integration processes in the orthographic decision task. 
Regarding a spelling effect for the P600 component, we expected it, 
at least in the orthographic decision task, since the differences of the 
P600 between words and pseudohomophones were shown in several 
tasks requiring decision (e.g., Bakos et al., 2018; Gonz´alez-Garrido et al., 
2014). However, we only found a trend towards significance, which was 
associated with the stimulus set factor and therefore was not considered. 
Apparently, the effects associated with the P600 component not only

strongly depend on the task but also on the stimulus material. A possible 
explanation may also be differences in the analysis procedure: the 
incorrect trials are usually discarded from the ERP analysis (e.g., Bakos 
et al., 2018; Gonz´alez-Garrido et al., 2014). We did not exclude incorrect 
trials in the orthographic decision task to equalize the analysis condi­
tions with the reading task, which could cause data inconsistency. 
In conclusion, we would like to note that the presence of a motor 
response in the orthographic decision task and its absence in the reading 
task means these tasks are not identical, which could affect the studied 
components. However, by adding a motor response to the reading task, 
or postponing it in the orthographic decision task, we would change the 
tasks themselves, which are often used in experiments, and make it 
difficult to compare our data with data from the literature. 
5. Conclusions 
In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that processes 
associated with recognizing correct spelling of words may depend on the 
task. First, the orthographic decision task modulated the spelling 
recognition processes at 180–260 ms in contrast to the reading task. At 
the same time, the amplitudes of the earlier P1, N1 and P600 compo­
nents were not sensitive to the spelling of words in any of the tasks. On 
the contrary, the amplitudes of the N400 component were modulated by 
the spelling of words regardless of the task. Thus, our results show that 
spelling recognition involves general lexico-semantic processes that are 
independent of the task, but the orthographic decision task modulates 
the spelling-specific processes necessary to quickly detect conflicts be­
tween orthographic and phonological representations of words in 
memory.
