The ability of metaphor comprehension reflects the cognitive status of elders. This study explored the ability of 
Chinese aMCI patients to access metaphorical meaning based on linguistic models of metaphor processing. ERPs 
were recorded from 30 aMCI patients and 30 control participants when judging the meaningfulness of literal 
sentences, conventional metaphors, novel metaphors, and anomalous expressions. The lower accuracy of the 
aMCI group revealed an impairment in metaphoric comprehension ability, but this difference was not reflected in 
ERPs data. In all participants, anomalous endings to sentences evoked the most negative N400 amplitude, 
whereas conventional metaphors evoked the smallest N400 amplitude. The LPC amplitude might be masked by a 
metaphor rebound effect when processing novel metaphors, which was consistent with the Graded Salience 
Model that novel metaphors needed further semantic integration. The results suggest that the aMCI patients may 
suffer an impairment in metaphorical meaning recognition, which the declined working memory may cause.   
1. Introduction 
A metaphor is a prototypical form of nonliteral language, which is 
not necessarily interpreted on the literal ground. Employing the over­
lapping process of cognition and world knowledge, metaphorical 
comprehension competence indicates higher abstract thinking and 
demonstrates higher-level language processing. Thus, it is an example of 
higher-level language and a fundamental thinking approach and 
cognitive tool in the human conceptual system (Lakoff & Johnson, 
1980). Considering the critical role of metaphor in cognition and lan­
guage, the study of metaphor is of great value. Despite the abundant 
studies of metaphor, few researchers have related it to cognitive change 
and explored the metaphor comprehending ability of amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. aMCI is regarded as a transitional 
stage between normal aging and dementia, providing a window for 
studying the onset of the language decline of the pAD (probable Alz­
heimer's Disease) patients. Both clinics and academics have acknowl­
edged that language is a manageable new cognitive marker for the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Combing the critical role of metaphor, 
the study of metaphor comprehension competence of the aMCI patients 
has both theoretical and practical significance. This study aims to 
explore the metaphor comprehension competence of the aMCI patients 
from both behavioral and neurological data. 
1.1. Metaphor and aging 
The study of metaphor competence for cognitively healthy older 
adults is mainly focused on three aspects: the originality of metaphor 
production (Mashal et al., 2014), the ability to find meaning in meta­
phor (Monetta et al., 2007), and the speed in finding meaning in met­
aphor (Sundaray et al., 2018). Researchers often portray the metaphor 
competence of cognitively healthy older adults by contrasting them with 
that of younger people. Bonnaud et al. (2002) asked the subjects to select 
the word pairs with metaphoric relations. The result showed that the 
correct rate of the elderly was significantly higher than that of the 
younger adults, but the recognition speed was slower. Qualls and Harris 
(2003) employed 40 younger and 40 older adults to complete the 20- 
item forced-choice multiple-category Metaphor Comprehension Test. 
After controlling for working memory, metaphor comprehension was 
comparable between the groups (Kaan et al., 2000). 
Several studies provided evidence of difficulties with processing 
metaphors in AD patients. Maki et al. (2013) chose the Metaphoric and

Sarcastic Scenario Test (MSST), consisting of 5 metaphoric sentences 
selected from standard textbooks of the Japanese language for 1st, 2nd, 
and 3rd grades in elementary school to compare the metaphoric 
comprehension ability of 31 young normal controls, 104 standard aged 
control, 42 aMCI patients and 30 mild AD patients. They asked subjects 
to select the meaning of the given metaphor from 5 options: the correct 
answer, literal interpretation, the option associated with the part of the 
sentence, misunderstanding of the sentence, and “not knowing”. The 
study showed that comprehension began to decline during the aMCI 
period because of their difficulty on suppressing inappropriate literal 
interpretation. The study of Winner and Gardner (1977) asked 7 AD 
patients with different degrees of disease to select the picture that best 
matched a given metaphorical statement among four pictures, and the 
AD patients were found to pick the picture representing the metaphor­
ical meanings as many times as the picture representing the literal 
meaning (Winner & Gardner, 1977). However, some studies claimed 
that the decline of figurative language was not an early symptom of 
dementia, and metaphor comprehension was preserved in most of the 
AD subjects even at a later stage. For instance, Papagno (2001) exam­
ined AD patients' comprehension of metaphors over six months and 
found that only four patients demonstrated impairment in metaphor 
comprehension. However, when retested six months later, patients 
showed an overall decrease. Amanzio et al. (2008) also compared AD 
patients' ability to interpret conventional and novel metaphors, and the 
results supported their prediction that patients had difficulty with novel 
metaphors. However, their comprehension of conventional ones was 
similar to healthy controls. 
By summarizing the previous studies, we find the two main short­
comings in the current study. The first point is the lack of attention to the 
aMCI patients' metaphor competence. Although it is generally accepted 
that metaphor comprehension is impaired in AD patients, there is no 
consensus on the onset of this impairment. Some studies claim the 
decline is an early symptom of dementia, while some claim that the 
impairment occurs later. aMCI is a transitional stage between normal 
aging and dementia, thus providing a window to study the onset of the 
metaphor decline of pAD patients. The second point is that most work 
has only used offline measures. Accuracy and response time are exoge­
nous behavioral data reflecting the combined results of multiple 
cognitive processing processes, and it's impossible to show the perfor­
mance during the processing. With the development of technology, re­
searchers seem to have found more scientific and direct methods to 
study the neural mechanism of metaphor processing. 
1.2. Metaphor and ERP 
In recent years, the investigation of metaphor comprehension has 
benefited from the development of experimental techniques used in 
cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics, such as eye-tracking, brain 
event-related potential (ERP), and functional magnetic resonance 
(Bonnaud et al., 2002), among which ERP technology is considered as a 
helpful tool to disclose the time-course of neural mechanism underlying 
metaphor comprehension, due to its non-invasive procedure, ultra-high 
resolution and lower cost (Wang, 2018). Among all the ERP compo­
nents, N400 and LPC are interpreted as indexing the degree of engage­
ment in the metaphoric comprehension task. 
N400 is first observed in semantically incongruent sentences, such as 
“He spread the bread with socks” (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980). A negative 
going potential is evoked when the ending word is incongruous with 
context. The amplitude of the N400 has been shown to vary semantically 
with semantic information processing. It is regarded as an index of the 
ease and difficulty of retrieving information related to word meaning 
(Zanolie et al., 2012). Most studies have found that target words of 
metaphor evoke larger N400 amplitude than final words of literal ex­
pressions. However, the waveforms show no significant difference be­
tween types of words, suggesting that accessing metaphoric meaning 
seems to use the common comprehension mechanism but needs more 
cognitive resources. This has been supported by Coulson and Van Petten 
(2002), who found a more significant N400 effect on metaphors than 
literal sentences and intermediate literal mapping by adopting the 
sentence-final words paradigm. N400 is also related to the predictability 
of the target word. The smaller the predictability, the larger the N400 
amplitude. Subjects can preactivate the upcoming words in literal sen­
tences based on the context information. If the word matches the pre­
diction, the N400 amplitude will be smaller. If the prediction is 
unsuccessful, subjects need to consume more cognitive resources to 
extract semantic information about the word. As presented in a 
sentence-final word study, Lai et al. (2009) found that the amplitudes of 
the N400 component were more negative for novel metaphors compared 
with conventional metaphors and literal sentences, indicating that the 
target words of novel metaphors were more unpredictable and had the 
most difficulty of semantic integration (Ma et al., 2016). 
The late positive component (LPC), a component that spears later 
than the retrieval of the semantic information of words, is considered to 
reflect sentence-level integration (Kaan et al., 2000) or reanalysis 
(Friederici, 1995). Petten et al. (1991) suggested that the LPC indexed 
“the extend retrieval of semantic and episodic information and the 
integration of that information with the context of working memory”. 
Coulson and Van Petten (2002) found larger LPCs for endings of meta­
phoric sentences compared to literal conclusions, which was interpreted 
as reflecting recovery and integration of additional material from se­
mantic memory, but they didn't claim the familiarity of selected meta­
phors. However, Friederici et al. (1999) found that the novel metaphor 
had the smallest LPC amplitude. They thought a negative component 
might reflect a sentence-level semantic violation in the same window as 
LPC, which canceled out with the LPC component. 
N400 reflects predictability and semantic retrieval, and LPC reflects 
sentence-level integration. Overall, the N400 and LPC components are 
associated with the metaphor study and should be focused on for anal­
ysis in this study. 
1.3. Metaphor processing model 
The processing sequence theory of metaphor comprehension focuses 
on the temporal processing of metaphor, mainly exploring the process­
ing orders of metaphorical meaning and literal meaning. The Standard 
Pragmatic Model argues that the literal meaning of the sentence is 
processed firstly, and the metaphorical meaning can be achieved only 
after the literal meaning is found unsuitable or inconsistent with the 
context. They are inspired by Lakoff and Johnson's Conceptual Metaphor 
View, which contends that the listener must refer to a general connec­
tion between two categories to comprehend a metaphor. This corre­
spondence should be a component of the human conceptual system 
(Bonnaud et al., 2002). Glucksberg et al. (1982) came up with the Par­
allel Hypothesis. Different from the Standard Pragmatic Model, this 
hypothesis holds that metaphors should be accessible in any context and 
automatically understood without the effort of awareness. That is to say, 
metaphorical meanings are as readily as literal meanings. Both theories 
have some applicability, but neither model considers the difference 
within metaphors. 
With the deepening of studies, researchers gradually find that novel 
metaphors are processed differently from conventional ones (Blank, 
1988) and that with a great deal of contextual support, the processing of 
figurative interpretation appears to occur directly and may even su­
persede literal processing. The judgment of metaphors is based on 
various factors, including the subject's social context, personality, 
knowledge, and expertise (Blasko & Kazmerski, 2006). The Graded 
Salience Model proposed by Giora (1997) seems to be a model devel­
oped to handle all these factors, which points out that salience is the 
main factor determining the precedence of access. One promising idea is 
that the most salient stored meaning will be activated immediately, 
regardless of context. However, a strong context can later activate less 
salient or more peripheral interpretations (Giora, 2003). According to 
J. Yang and L. Huang

the model, the salient meaning, whether metaphorical or literal, is al­
ways processed first. Considering the differences within metaphorical 
sentences, we prefer the Graded Salience Model in this study. 
1.4. The current study 
This study aims to bridge a significant gap in the literature by 
examining the metaphor comprehension performance in patients with 
aMCI via behavioral and neurological data and exploring the cognitive 
factors related to metaphor processing. 30 patients with aMCI and 30 
normal aging adults were recruited to complete a sentence-final word 
paradigm and delayed sentence meaning judgment task, and their EEG 
data were recorded simultaneously. Materials included literal sentences, 
anomalous expressions, and metaphors. Metaphors were separated into 
conventional metaphors and novel metaphors based on familiarity. The 
accurate rate, response time, N400, and LPC component were analyzed 
to portray the metaphor comprehension performance of the aMCI 
patients. 
Based on the existing researches, we made some predictions about 
the results. Considering the declined cognitive ability of the aMCI pa­
tients, we assumed that the accuracy rate of the aMCI group was lower 
than the NC group, and the response time might be longer. Based on the 
Graded Salience Model, we assumed that the response time of conven­
tional metaphors should be much shorter than that of novel metaphors, 
and the waveforms of these two kinds of materials should be different, 
representing on the amplitude and latency of N400 and LPC compo­
nents. We assumed that the aMCI patients and normal control group 
might show some differences in the ERP data. Working memory might 
be related to metaphor processing. 
2. Method 
2.1. Participants 
Thirty individuals with multi-domain amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment (aMCI) and thirty normal controls (NC) were recruited for 
this study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals with 
aMCI were recruited from the Department of Neurology and the 
Department of Memory Clinic of [removed for review]. Age-, gender-, 
and education-matched NCs were recruited from the community. All 
participants had completed tests for MMSE, MOCA-B, working memory, 
semantic memory, and verbal fluency. All participants' demographic and 
clinical information was recorded at the same time. The demographic 
and clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. 
The Research Ethics Committee of [removed for review] approved the 
study, and all participants provided written informed consent. 
Exclusion Criteria: 1) age below 50 years; 2) definite history of stoke; 
3) definite history of other diseases of the central nervous system such as 
infection, demyelinating diseases, and Parkinson's disease; 4) definite 
history of mental illness such as schizophrenia, major depressive dis­
order; 5) severe impaired vision, hearing, aphasia disorder, and other 
physical diseases that seriously affect neuropsychological testing; 6) 
alcohol or drug addiction. 
For the NC group, the inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) had no 
complaint of memory/cognitive decline; 2) MMSE > 20 for primary 
school or above, MMSE > 24 for junior high schools or above; 3) all 
cognitive domains were within the normal range; 4) the ability to 
perform daily errands was not impaired; 5) no history of diabetes. 
For the aMCI group, the general criteria had been defined previously 
(Petersen, 2004): 1) complaints of memory/cognitive decline by the 
subject and his caregiver; 2) CDR = 0.5; 3) any of the following two 
criteria were met: i) at least two tests within the cognitive memory 
domain scored below the established cut-off; ii) at least two cognitive 
domains (memory and other cognitive domains) were impaired. 
2.2. Materials 
To exclude possible confounding factors that probably influence 
experiment results, such as syntax complexity and sentence length, the 
NP-V (be)-NP (A is B) sentence structure was selected. Four kinds of 
materials were selected from Wang (2007), Ju (2010) and Zhou (2011), 
including conventional metaphors, novel metaphors, literal sentences, 
and anomalous sentences (see Table 2). Conventional metaphors were 
more understandable and familiar, novel metaphors were less familiar 
but still interpretable, and anomalous sentences were the least inter­
pretable. All metaphors were conducted familiarity test. The final corpus 
covered 240 Chinese sentences, including 40 conventional metaphors, 
40 novel metaphors, 40 literal sentences, and 120 anomalous. All the 
materials were divided into five blocks, and the word properties of target 
words were matched between conditions with the same number of 
characters, frequency, and part of speech. 
2.3. Procedure 
Sentence-final word paradigm and sentence comprehension task 
were employed in this experiment. Each sentence was cut into three 
parts (“NP-subject,” “V (be)-predicate,” and “NP-object”). Every word 
was in the font of Song and was set back with a grey background with a 
size of 72 points. 
The whole experiment was conducted in a sound-attenuated, elec­
trically-shielded chamber. The subjects were seated on a comfortable 
chair in front of a 17-inch computer screen located approximately 100 
cm from their eyes. The E-prime 3.0 software showed the stimulus. The 
subjects were offered instructions before performing their experimental 
task. Before the formal experiment blocks, 20 trials (4 literal sentences, 4 
conventional metaphors, 4 novel metaphors, and 4 anomalous expres­
sions) not included in the study were provided for warm-ups. 
During the formal experiment, all subjects completed 5 test blocks, 
with 40 conventional trials, 40 novel trials, 40 literal trials, and 120 
anomalous trials. Each trial started with a fixation cross at the center of 
the screen with a duration of 500 ms. The subject and predicate words 
were presented for 500 ms, followed by a blank screen of 500 ms. The 
target word was then presented for 1000 ms. At the offset of the target 
word, a dark screen was presented for 1000 ms before a question mark 
“???” appeared. Upon seeing the question mark, each subject should

respond as quickly and as accurately as possible whether the sentence 
made sense: pressing the left button if the sentence had a plausible 
meaning or the right button if the sentence was anomalous. With an 
interval of 1500 ms, it proceeded to the next trial. Participants were 
given a 10-min break between each block. The order of all trials was 
randomly presented. The paradigm is demonstrated in Fig. 1. 
2.4. EEG recording and data processing 
EEG was recorded from 64 single Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes posi­
tioned based on the international extended 10-20 system using a Neu­
roScan SynAmps2 (SynAmps2TM Model 8050 EEG amplifier and a data 
acquisition system, Abbotsford, Victoria, Australia) (seen in Fig. 2). Four 
facial electrodes were positioned adjacent to each eye's left and right 
outer canthus and above and below the left orbit to measure eye 
movement. The data were processed in MATLAB (Version R2016a) using 
the EEGLAB toolbox (Version 14.1.1). Electrodes were grounded to 
Ground (GND) and referenced online to an electrode between the CZ and 
CPZ electrode positions. Impedances were kept below 10 KΩ. EEG was 
sampled at 1000 Hz with an online bandpass of 0.01-250 Hz. ERPs were 
time-locked to the onset of the final word of a sentence. The ERP data for 
a total period of 1200 milliseconds (including 200 ms before the pres­
ence of the stimulus and 1000 ms after the presentation) were analyzed 
offline with filtering (30 Hz), removing electrooculogram artifacts, 
being referenced to the average of the left and right mastoids and being 
baseline-corrected concerning a 200 ms pre-stimulus recording interval. 
Before averaging, trails with eye movements, blinks, and excessive 
muscle activity were rejected. For each participant, ERPs were derived 
by averaging correctly classified trials on each type of target word 
(conventional metaphors, CON-MTP; novel metaphors, NOV-MTP; 
literal sentences, LIT; anomalous sentences, ANO). 
2.5. Statistical analysis 
For each participant and each condition, we removed the RT mea­
sures that either corresponded to incorrect response or were 3SDs from 
the mean of the corresponding subset. To analyze the RTs, we fitted a 
linear mixed model to raw RT data using the lme4 package (Bates et al., 
2015) in R. The model included fixed effects for group (MCI and NC), 
material type (conventional metaphors, CON; novel metaphors, NOV; 
literal sentences, LIT; and anomalous expressions, ANO), and interaction 
item (group by material type). For the random effects, we first built the 
model with the maximal random effects structure. Based on our exper­
iment, two groups of participants judged the meaningfulness of 4 kinds 
of materials, with total 60 subjects and 240 items. Material type varies 
within-subjects but between-items. We thus needed to specify a by- 
subject random slope for material type. Subject group varied between- 
subjects but within-items. The design thus called for a by-item random 
slope for group. The maximal random effects structure contained four 
random effects: a by-subject random intercept, a by-subject random 
slope for material type, a by-item random intercept, and a by-item 
random slope for group. If the model failed to converge or presented 
overfitting, we used the Principal Components Analysis (Bates et al., 
2015) of the random effects structure to identify the variance compo­
nents that could be removed without a loss in goodness of fit of the 
model. The parameters of the optimization model were reported. For 
each of the three fixed effects, its statistical significance was assessed 
using the Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom from the 
lmerTest R package (Kuznetsova et al., 2017), and that we reported the 
corresponding F values and p values. For accuracy, we fitted a gener­
alized linear mixed model with a binary distribution. For the fixed and 
random effects, the model was built in the same manner as in the 
analysis of RTs. In the statistical analyses, we reported the χ2 values and

corresponding p values for each of the fixed effects. 
ERPs were isolated from the ongoing EEG by simple averaging, so the 
ERP data for each participant on each condition was the average of 
corresponding items. To analyze the ERP data of N400 and LPC com­
ponents, we extracted the data of interested channels and fitted a linear 
mixed model with group, material and interaction item as fixed effects, 
while participant and channel as random effects. In the analysis of ERP, 
channel varied within subjects and within material types, thus the 
maximal random effects structure contained six random effects: a by- 
subject random intercept, a by-subject random slope for material type, 
a by-channel random intercept, a by-channel random slope for group, a 
by-channel random slope for material, and random slopes for the effect 
of interaction across channel. The optimization model was built in the 
same manner as in the analysis of behavior data. 
Post Hoc analysis was calculated using the emmeans package (Lenth, 
2023) when the main effect of predictors or interaction effects were 
significant. Confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated using the 
Wald method. 
Regression analysis was adopted to explore the relationship between 
all variables. Multiple linear regression was conducted to determine 
which variables remain significant when they were entered into a single 
model. The conventional significance level of α = 0.05 was used for the 
overall analysis. 
3. Result 
3.1. Behavioral results 
3.1.1. Accuracy 
Table 3 presented the mean accuracy on 4 kinds of materials for the 
NC and the aMCI group. The model with maximal random effects 
structure appeared overfitting. After removing the random slope for 
material across participant, and random slope for group across item 
based on PCA analysis, we got the optimization model for ACC, the re­
sults of which were presented in Appendix A. 
In the optimization model, we found a significant main effect of 
group (χ2 = 22.435, df = 1, p < 0.0001), wherein the NC group had 
higher accuracy than the aMCI group. The main effect of material type 
(χ2 = 234.042, df = 3, p < 0.0001) and the interaction between group 
and material (χ2 = 11.134, df = 3, p < 0.011) were also significant. A 
post hoc analysis found that participants were most accurate on the 
literal sentences, followed by anomalous expressions, conventional 
metaphors and novel metaphors. All pairwise comparisons were signif­
icant. And for all kinds of materials, the accuracy of the NC group was 
higher than of the aMCI group. 
3.1.2. Response time 
The mean response time for each group on each condition was shown 
in Table 4. The optimization model for RTs removed the random slope 
for group across items to avoid overfitting, and the summary of the 
model was presented in Appendix B. We found the main effect of ma­
terial type (F = 15.009, df = 82.79, p < 0.001), wherein the response 
time of novel metaphors was significantly longer than that of conven­
tional metaphors (z = −6.287, p < 0.0001), literal sentences (z = 5.629, 
p < 0.0001), and anomalous expressions (z = 4.523, p < 0.001). The 
response time of the other three types of sentences did not show 
statistical significance among each other. The main effect of group was 
non-significant (F = 1.0785, df = 55.832, p = 0.303), and there was no 
interaction between group and material (F = 0.127, df = 52.838, p =
0.943). 
3.2. Electrophysiological data 
In this part, we focus on the stimulus-locked ERP data, which allows 
us to explore the time course of the metaphor processing and examine 
whether the behavioral data's differences are reflected in the ERP data. 
The amplitude and latency of N400 and LPC components were analyzed 
with linear mixed model with the group, material type and interaction 
item as fixed effects, while participants and channels as random effects. 
3.2.1. N400 
Following previous literature on the N400 and LPC for Chinese 
metaphor (Ji et al., 2020; Lu & Zhang, 2012) and visual inspection based 
on the grand averaged data, the time window of N400 was defined as 
200-400 ms (seen in Fig. 3). 
According to Figs. 4 and 5, the material type effects are more evident 
in the NC group, and the NC group had a more negative N400 compo­
nent than the aMCI group. Fig. 4 presented the amplitude differences in 
a 200-400 ms time window between these two groups of people, in 
which the blue area showed the most different parts, including elec­
trodes AF4, FC4, FC2, FCZ, FC1, F1, F2, FZ, F4, F6. 
The mean amplitude of ERP components elicited by the target word 
of correctly judged sentences was qualified as the mean of the voltage 
value to a 200-ms pre-stimulus baseline over the N400 window (200- 
400 ms post-stimulus onset) in the NC group and the aMCI group at AF4, 
FC4, FC2, FCZ, FC1, F1, F2, Fz, F4, F6 channels. The mean amplitudes of 
the N400 in both participant groups are presented in Table 5. 
The model with maximal random effects structure contained six 
random effects, but presented the issue of overfitting. The results of PCA 
analysis suggested to remove the by-channel random slope for group, 
by-channel random slope for material type and the random slopes for the 
effect of interaction across channel. Appendix C provided the summary 
of the optimization model for N400 amplitude. We found a significant 
main effect of material type (F = 4.571, df = 58, p = 0.006), but the main 
effect of group (F = 2.729, df = 58, p = 0.104) and the interaction effect 
between group and material type (F = 1.213, df = 58, p = 0.312) was not 
significant. The Post Hoc analysis revealed that the N400 amplitude 
elicited by the anomalous expressions was significantly larger than that 
of the conventional metaphors (t = −3.317, df = 58, p = 0.008). 
Table 6 presented the mean latency of N400 to correctly judged 
materials at the selected electrodes in the NC and the aMCI group. The 
optimization model contains the random intercepts and random slopes 
for the effect of material type across subjects, and the random slopes for 
the effect of group across channels. Appendix D provided the summary 
of the optimization model for N400 latency. The main effect of material 
type (F = 1.071, df = 58, p = 0.369) and group (F = 0.318, df = 59.35, p 
= 0.5749) were non-significant, and there was no interaction between 
material type and group (F = 0.44, df = 58, p = 0.725). This indicated no 
significant differences on the N400 latency between two groups of 
subjects on these four kinds of materials.

time window of LPC was defined as 450-750 ms after the appearance of 
the target word. The difference in grand average amplitude of the NC 
and MCI group in this time window was presented in Fig. 5 to determine 
the electrode to be analyzed. The red part in this figure represented a 
significant difference between these two groups in 450-750 ms, 
including FP1, FP2, FPZ, AF3, AF4, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, so 
these electrodes were selected to analyze the differences between NC 
and MCI group on LPC component. 
The mean amplitude of the LPC in these two groups was presented in 
Table 7. The optimization model contained group, material type and the 
interaction as fixed effect, and the random intercepts over participants 
and channels respectively. The details of the model were presented in 
Appendix E. We find the significant main effect of material type (F =
6.2488, df = 58, p = 0.0009), wherein the LPC amplitude elicited by the 
conventional metaphors were significantly larger than that of the novel 
metaphor (Z = 3.992, p = 0.004), and LPC amplitude of the literal

sentences was larger than the anomalous expressions (Z = −2.410, p =
0.075). The main effect of group was not significant (F = 0.371, df = 58, 
p = 0.545), and there was no interaction between group and material 
type (F = 0.7739, df = 58, p = 0.5133). 
Table 8 and Appendix F showed the mean latency of the LPC to 
correctly judged materials at the selected electrodes in the NC and the 
aMCI group, and summary of the optimization model for the LPC la­
tency. We found the main effect of group (F = 0.6989, df = 58, p =
0.4066) and main effect of material type (F = 1.791, df = 60.8, p =
0.158) were non-significant, and there was no interaction between 
group and material type (F = 0.34, df = 58, p = 0.796). 
3.3. Cognitive abilities related to metaphor comprehension 
Pearson r correlations were employed to explore the relationships 
between variables. As shown in Table 9, the results revealed that there 
existed a positive relationship between working memory and conven­
tional metaphors (r = 0.356, p = 0.005), literal sentences (r = 0.266, p 
= 0.04), and anomalous sentences (r = 0.419, p = 0.001). Semantic 
memory was positively correlated with conventional metaphors (r =
0.324, p = 0.012), novel metaphors (r = 0.275, p = 0.034), and 
anomalous sentences (r = 0.395, p = 0.002), while the score of verbal 
fluency only had a significant positive relationship with anomalous 
sentences. 
We then put these factors into a multiple linear regression analysis to 
detect which cognitive factor significantly affected the accuracy of 
metaphors. We analyzed working memory, semantic memory, and ver­
bal fluency scores as independent variables and accuracy of the delayed 
sentence meaning judgment as the dependent variable. As shown in 
Table 10, the regression equation was significant, F = 3.56, p < 0.05, 
where working memory (β = 0.473, p = 0.003) was a significant positive 
predictor of accuracy. Semantic memory and verbal fluency did not 
predict accuracy. Together, these variables explained 11.5 % of the 
variance in accuracy. 
4. Discussion 
The prime goal of this study was to assess the performance of the 
aMCI patients' metaphor comprehension ability from both behavioral 
and electrophysiological data. ERPs were recorded from 30 aMCI pa­
tients and 30 normal aging adults who were asked to read metaphorical, 
literal, and anomalous sentences and to judge their meaningfulness. The 
results of statistical analysis need further discussion. 
4.1. The difference in behavioral data between the two groups 
The aMCI patients did not perform as well as the healthy controls in 
determining the meaning of metaphors. The behavioral data in the 
present study showed that novel metaphors had the lowest accuracy in 
both groups, followed by conventional metaphors, literal sentences, and 
anomalous expressions. The aMCI participants had lower accuracy than 
the normal control group on all four kinds of materials, which was 
consistent with other studies (Cardoso et al., 2014), indicating the 
ability to find meaning in metaphor might be impaired. But, for response 
time, the main effect of the group was not significant, indicating that the 
NC group and the aMCI group spent almost the same amount of time 
determining sentences' meaningfulness. This seems to be inconsistent 
with the patient's performance on accuracy. There are three in­
terpretations of this result. The first one is that the speed of recognizing 
the metaphoric meaning of the aMCI patients is not impaired, and they 
make the judgment at the same speed as the NC group. However, this 
result is inconsistent with previous studies. The second one is that the 
aMCI patients might adopt a more conservative (“all or nothing”) pro­
cessing strategy, in which, to satisfy the task instructions (rapid judg­
ment and precision), patients reject all the sentences with semantic 
uncertainty (especially novel metaphors). They accepted only obviously 
meaningful sentences (as also noted by Strandburg et al., 1997 and 
Iakimova et al., 2005). Another interpretation points to the claim that 
the difference in response time between these two groups might be 
masked by the 1000 ms time window between the target word and the 
question mark. The paradigm employed in this study is the delayed 
sentence meaning judgment. To ensure the electrophysiological data of 
metaphor processing would not be affected by EMG, such as keystrokes, 
we drew on the paradigm of Federmeier et al. (2010) by adding a 1000 
ms time window between the target word and question mark. Thus, the 
difference in response time might be masked. 
Although it is uncertain whether the speed of recognizing the 
metaphoric meaning of the aMCI patients has decreased, it is clear from 
the accuracy that the ability to recognize metaphoric meaning might be 
impaired in this group. 
4.2. The difference in ERPs data among materials 
In this study, the N400 amplitudes of four kinds of materials were 
graded: conventional metaphors eliciting the smallest N400, followed by 
novel metaphors, literal sentences and anomalous expressions. Some 
researchers suggested that N400 varies systematically with semantic 
information processing and could be regarded as a general index of the 
ease or difficulty of retrieving lexical meaning or conceptual knowledge 
from memory (Kutas & Federmeier, 2000; van Hell & Dijkstra, 2002). 
Based on this point of view, it could be inferred that the lexical meaning 
or conceptual knowledge of conventional metaphors was the easiest to 
extract, followed by literal sentences, novel metaphors, and anomalous 
expressions. Kutas et al. (2006) claimed that retrieval difficulty depen­
ded on the stored representation (word class, frequency, etc.). As

mentioned by Pynte et al. (1996), metaphors did not form a homoge­
neous category. There was a continuum from “lexical” metaphors, 
whose meanings were probably in the mental lexicon (e.g., the con­
ventional metaphors like “time is money”), to entirely new ones (e.g., 
the novel metaphors). The metaphorical meaning of conventional met­
aphors was stored in the psychological lexicon, and the processing of it 
was more dependent on meaning recognition rather than construction, 
so their metaphoric meaning was more salient, which might be the 
reason why they elicit even smaller N400 amplitude than the literal 
sentences. 
The retrieval difficulty also depended on retrieval cues provided by 
immediate and discourse context (Arzouan et al., 2007), which pointed 
to predictability. Luke and Christianson (2016) pointed out that humans 
had “graded prediction”, which generated partial predictions about 
upcoming input. This prediction was conceived as passive, diffuse, cost- 
free, and ubiquitous. In this point of view, individuals may active a series 
of related words simultaneously when they see the “NP-subject” and “V 
(be)-predicate” on the screen, and the degree of activation is propor­
tional to their cloze probability (Frisson et al., 2017). It might be sug­
gested that during online comprehension, the metaphoric meaning of 
conventional metaphors was more rapidly preactivated based on each 
participant's background word knowledge. Thus, the N400 amplitude of 
target words in conventional metaphors was lower than that of novel 
metaphors and anomalous expressions, whose target words had lower 
cloze probability, and need more cognitive resource to activate. 
Later in the time course, the waveforms of four kinds of materials 
showed apparent differences. In this study, the LPC component elicited 
by novel metaphors has the smallest amplitude, followed by conven­
tional metaphors and literal sentences. This result is consistent with Lai 
et al.'s (2009) study. In Lai's study, they used a sensuality judgment task 
and compared ERPs elicited by the target words of anomalous expres­
sions, novel metaphors, conventional metaphors, and literal sentences. 
Within a later window (440-560 ms), ERPs associated with conventional 
metaphors had the same amplitude as literal sentences, while the novel 
metaphors stayed anomalous and had a lower LPC amplitude. They 
proposed a metaphor rebound effect that the later window might reflect 
a continuation of the processing underlying the N400 (Lai et al., 2009), 
and a negative component was elicited at the same window, overlapping 
the positive amplitude of LPC. 
Similarly, in this study, the negative component occurred in novel 
metaphors whose meaning needed further semantic interpretation to 
arrive at a congruous metaphor meaning. Thus, although a more positive 
LPC might be elicited in novel metaphors, the late negative waveform 
may mask it, appearing as a relatively low LPC (Arzouan et al., 2007). 
This has also been reported by Friederici (1995) in sentences with se­
mantic anomalies. Some researchers found larger LPC amplitudes for 
endings of metaphoric sentences, but they did not report the novelty of 
metaphors, which was an important factor in secondary semantic inte­
gration processes. 
4.3. The difference in ERPs data between groups 
In this study, we found that the mean amplitude of N400 and LPC 
components of the aMCI group was lower than that of the NC group. 
However, the differences did not reach a statistically significant level. 
From a neurophysiological perspective, a more pronounced amplitude 
might index the activation of a more significant number of neurons 
(Kutas & Federmeier, 2011), so the lower amplitude in the aMCI group 
may imply a decreased activity of neurons. It has been reported that the 
deposition of extracellular amyloid beta-protein (aβ) in patients with 
Alzheimer's Disease can damage the peripheral nerve cell membrane 
and mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the injury of nerve cells and 
the decrease of transmission efficiency of excitation between neurons 
(Zaman et al., 2000). For the lower amplitude in the aMCI group, we 
assumed that as a transitional stage between normal aging and de­
mentia, the damage of nerve cells was not serious in the aMCI stage, so it 
only presented a downward trend of excitation transmission efficiency 
and had not formed significant difference with the healthy control 
group. 
Similar waveforms of conventional metaphors, novel metaphors, and 
literal sentences between the aMCI and regular control group suggested 
the same strategy employed on metaphoric processing. Thus, the elec­
trophysical data did not present these two groups' differences. 
4.4. Cognitive factors related to metaphor processing 
Metaphor competence indicates higher abstract thinking, which 
employs the overlapping processes of cognition, language, and world 
knowledge. To find the factors influencing metaphor comprehension 
ability, every participant conducted a series of cognitive ability tests 
before the formal experiment, including a working memory test, se­
mantic memory, and verbal fluency test. The results of Pearson corre­
lation analysis show that working memory, semantic memory, and 
verbal fluency positively correlated with different materials' accuracy. 
We then put these factors into multiple linear regression analysis and 
found that working memory (β = 0.473, p = 0.003) was a significant 
positive predictor of accuracy. 
Working memory is the aspect of memory that involves the simul­
taneous storage and processing of information. The resource hypothesis 
view claims that working memory comprises a limited number of 
general-purpose entities that can enable or enhance a range of cognitive 
functions (Salthouse, 1990), including reasoning, learning, and lan­
guage comprehension. A decline in working memory has been impli­
cated as a possible explanation for deficits in various language 
comprehension tasks, including reading comprehension, identification 
of pronoun references in sentences, and inferencing. Researchers argued 
that working memory was central to language comprehension because it 
was necessary to integrate information and resolve ambiguity (Qualls & 
Harris, 2003; Salthouse, 1990). And some studies have proved the role 
of working memory in figurative language comprehension. Upon ex­
amination of normal adults' verbal interpretations of idioms and prov­
erbs, Qualls and Harris (2003) found a low but significant correlation 
between subjects' ability to interpret proverbs and their working mem­
ory performance. Pierce et al. (2010) assessed working memory to 
determine its role in the automatic activation of metaphoric meaning. 
Higher working memory made people faster at judging metaphors and 
scrambled items. They also proposed two possibilities: working memory 
speeds the process through which metaphorical meanings were identi­
fied in the construction-integration stage. It might also enable people to 
identify the literal or figurative meaning efficiently. 
In this study, we also found that working memory was a significant 
positive predictor of accuracy. In this experiment, the “NP-subject” and 
“V (be)-predict” were presented one by one, and only lasted for 500 
milliseconds. Hence, participants had to pay attention and remember 
each word accurately and long enough to make the judgment. For the 
aMCI patients, the reduced working memory capacity or inefficiency in 
allocating resources may make it difficult to finish this task. Some pa­
tients claimed that before the appearance of a question mark, they had 
forgotten the “NP-subject” or “NP-object.” 
However, some researchers claim that semantic memory is also 
responsible for subjects' difficulty understanding metaphors (Zelinski & 
Hyde, 1996). Semantic memory is culturally shared, including knowl­
edge of objects, facts, concepts, and word meanings (Kazui et al., 2003). 
Viewed as expressions in which a word's meaning is transferred to 
another word's meaning, metaphors can be understood by identifying an 
expected contribution in two semantically disjointed concepts. The topic 
and vehicle of a metaphor are thought to be composed of a set of specific 
attributes that belong to distinct semantic categories, and a metaphor­
ical comprehension occurs when a salient attribute of the vehicle 
overlaps with an obscure attribute of the topic, in which the ability to 
retrieve word attributes from the semantic memory plays an important 
role. Semantic memory deficit is one of the typical symptoms of aMCI

and AD patients, as is their poor performance on the Boston Naming 
Test. In this study, semantic memory is positively correlated with the 
accuracy of conventional and novel metaphors in the Pearson test, but it 
was not a significant predictor of the accuracy of the sentence judgment 
task. That is to say, when working memory was controlled, the corre­
lation between semantic memory and accuracy was not significant 
anymore, indicating that these two variables were influenced by work­
ing memory. 
5. Conclusion 
This study detected the performance of metaphor comprehension in 
aMCI patients from behavioral and electrophysiological data. Compared 
with the normal control group, the aMCI patients had similar response 
times. It may point to the unimpaired processing speed or a conservative 
processing strategy. It's also possible that the time window between 
target words and question marks masked the difference in response time. 
But the lower accuracy of the aMCI patients indicated that they suffered 
impairment in recognizing metaphorical meaning in conventional and 
novel metaphors. However, ERPs showed that when accepted as 
meaningful, these sentences had similar waveforms to that of the NC 
group. Perhaps because of the damaged mitochondrial membrane, the 
decreased transmission efficiency of excitation between neurons results 
in a lower amplitude of the aMCI group. However, the differences did 
not reach the statistical significance level. The N400 amplitude indi­
cated that the lexical meaning or conceptual knowledge of conventional 
metaphors was the easiest to extract. However, when processing novel 
metaphors and anomalous expressions, the LPC amplitude may be 
masked by a metaphor rebound effect. This result supported the view 
that word meaning and knowledge are first mobilized during online 
metaphor comprehension, and sentence meaning was integrated with a 
later time window, consistent with the Graded Salience Model. The 
multiple linear regression shows that working memory was a positive 
predictor of accuracy. 
The findings of this study contribute to a further understanding of 
neural correlates of metaphor understanding in people with aMCI and 
inform the early language change of the aMCI patients. This is the first 
study to investigate the neural characteristics of metaphor comprehen­
sion in patients with this kind of disease to the best of our knowledge. It 
makes a novel contribution to the literature on the neural mechanism 
underlying the relationship between metaphor comprehension impair­
ment and cognitive decline. 
Several limitations and future directions should also be mentioned. 
First, head movements and muscle artifacts recorded during the exper­
iment were inevitable for the aMCI patients. Although flawed trials and 
artifacts have been removed during data processing, the results should 
still be carefully interpreted. Second, whether the differences or simi­
larities of the N400 and LPC components reflected the differences be­
tween groups on metaphoric comprehension should be carefully 
interpreted. The ERP studies on metaphors have produced inconsistent 
results, and researchers' understanding of these two components varies. 
The smaller LPC amplitude of novel metaphors remains to be explained. 
Further research is needed to elucidate the reasons. Third, although we 
expected to find between-group differences in the ERP components, no 
such differences were observed. The conservative strategy we assumed 
adopted by the aMCI group still needs more data support, and further 
studies should be conducted to make a convincing conclusion.
