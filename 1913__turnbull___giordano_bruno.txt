FOREWORD
EARNEST souls love to pay homage to the
memory of those heroes to whom we owe
our religious liberty and freedom.
Few
such heroes has our fair planet presented
us,
a Socrates, a Bruno, a Savonarola.
Bruno's
career
seemed
fraught
with
keen disappointment
and much suffering.
Born of heroic mental mould, in cloistered
cell he gained deep knowledge
and spir-
itual understanding.
This he hurled into
a sleeping cruel age, steeped in the gross
superstition of a selfish priestcraft.
He lived
and died the apostle of the
ever new and ever old religion,
that of
spiritual
insight.
Throughout
his writ-
ings, the student will readily see his love
of the Good is identified with the highest
kind of speculative philosophy.
When-
ever he inculcates the law and order of the
Universe, he gives us at the same time re-
splendent glimpses of the Nature and des-
tiny of the Soul of Man.

FOREWORD
We marvel at his genius, his earnest-
ness and devotion to those mighty truths
which graced his life and destiny.
Well
can we forgive him those acrid denuncia-
tions
and keen sarcasms
which
aroused
the minds of that twilight day.
And we must also throw the veil of for-
giveness on those benighted souls who kin-
dled the fires under the tortured and ema-
ciated body of the heroic Bruno.
Yes!
The errors of the Past must be
forgiven, for He who overshadows
us, ac-
cepts alike the errors and virtues of the
children of men; the former He purifies
in His JEtonic fires of Love, and the latter
"he mixes with the sweet influences of the
Pleiades
that
they
may
be
born
again
among the children of men."
Bruno, the "Italian of Italians," during
his
exile
longed
for
his
beloved
sunny
land. His return
cost him his captivity,
and then death.
His captivity gave
us
greater freedom, his death gave us larger
life.
And so we render homage to this noble

FOREWORD
9
spirit,
and believe that while the curling
flames
enveloped
his
quivering
mortal
frame, the Angel of the Word welcomed
his immortal Soul.
And the welcome!
What hidden Soul-Secret of thy Past,
noble Brother, brought to thee so harsh a
destiny?
Can we of unresponsive minds
answer?
In this work I have brought together
the best writings still existing of Bruno,
and
have
consulted
particularly
Berti's
excellent work on Giordano Bruno. I am
indebted
also to the
able translation of
L. Williams, who gave to the English-
speaking
public "The Heroic Enthusi-
asts." I have also to thank my dear wife,
who has assisted very largely in the trans-
lation of two German works
: Alois RiehFs
"Giordano
Bruno,"
and Dr.
Hermann
Brunnhofer's
"Translation
of
Bruno's
World Aspect and Destiny."
And for
the frontispiece I have to thank the pub-
lishers of The Open Court, Chicago.
The
other photos I picked up while travelling
in Europe.
The book I have briefly writ-

ten, and while giving the best of Bruno
we have had to regret many times the fact
that much has been lost.
The whole of
this message is but a tribute to the noble
memory of a noble martyr.

CHAPTER I
EARLY
DAYS IN THE
CAMPANIA
"Ordinary things and easy, are for common
and ordi-
nary
folk;
men
rare,
heroic,
and
divine
pass
along
by means of this road of Difficulty
until
at last Neces-
sity
herself
is
constrained
to
grant
to them
the
palm
of
Immortality."
G.
BRUNO.
GIORDANO BRUNO, the philosopher, poet,
and martyr, swept the intellectual heavens
of Europe like a brilliant
meteor, in the
latter half of the sixteenth century.
He
has
been
aptly
named
"the
wandering
knight of a philosopher."
In that most fertile country of the Cam-
pania, called sometimes "The Fortunate,"
rests
the city of Nola,
a short distance
from Naples and Mt. Vesuvius.
It is renowned for its resistance to Han-
nibal after the terrible slaughter of Can-
nse.
Nola was also the birthplace of Oc-
tavius
Caesar
and Marcus Agrippa.
It
11

12
GIORDANO BRUNO
has furnished museums and cabinets with
many archaic vases and coins, showing its
illustrious past.
To-day it is but a small provincial city,
but in ancient times it was renowned for
its culture and refinement.
It was found-
ed by
the
Chalcidian
Greeks,
and
was
adorned, in the Emperors'
time, by tur-
rets and walls
and with
palaces
of
the
noble families of Rome.
Its inhabitants
were conspicuous for their courteous man-
ners, their valor,
keenness of perception
and love of study.
It seems to have been
a favorite
place for the choice spirits of
the Renaissance, and in spite of the fear-
ful persecutions of pagan emperors and
Christian
princes,
it
still
retained
the
grand philosophy of Pythagoras, nor were
the sacred fires on the altar of Vesta ever
suffered to die out.
Poets, philosophers,
artists,
and other noted men
were
born
here, or had at least taken up their abode
here.
They were, however, eclipsed by the
fame of one man, equally remarkable for
the fate of his life and for the grandeur of

EARLY DAYS
13
his mind and spirit; one who can readily
be ranked with that of Socrates in knowl-
edge, and who also met a similar fate.
Giordano Bruno
had
a great
attach-
ment to his home.
He speaks of it as "the
golden fields of Nola."
One of his youth-
ful pleasures was to pass a night on the
mountain
Cicada
near
his
home
and
watch the stars, or contemplating,
to his
childish mind, the desolate sides of Vesu-
vius.
From the distance it looked barren
and bleak, but when seen near, it was cov-
ered with elms and oaks, the branches of
which
were
hung with grapevines.
He
recalls in later years how he used to think
this was the limit of the horizon, or the
ultimate
end of the earth.
It was then
that
Giordano
Bruno
learned,
to
his
astonishment, that vision of man is decep-
tive.
He saw that in going forward we
always remain in the center of our hori-
zon, and soon the thought took root that
nature
is everywhere one and the
same,
that only distance changes the appearance
of things.
He saw how illusory the senses

14
GIORDANO
BRUNO
might
be,
and how carefully
the judg-
ment must be held when only guided by
the senses ; the mind may grasp nature in
her grandeur, but the sage must work out
the details.
Bruno seems to have been of a sad dis-
position
and possessed of a lively imag-
ination.
His
inner
perceptions
soon
eclipsed his exterior reason.
In his early
years the times were full of agitation and
misfortune,
and were scarcely propitious
to study.
Earthquakes,
pestilence,
and
famine
scourged
fair
Campania.
The
Turks fought and ravished the country,
and carried off slaves.
The land was also
infested
by
bandits
and
outlaws.
But
worse
the Inquisition, with the bulls of
Paul III, and at the instigation of Igna-
tius of Loyola, stood ready to light its
fires and slaughter
the heretic.
Fateful
constellations ruled the tragic nativity of
Bruno.
His father,
Giovanna,
was
a soldier,
and his mother, named Francesca
Savo-
lini, baptized her son under the name of

EARLY DAYS
15
Philip.
At fifteen
he entered the mon-
astery
of
the
Dominicans
at
Naples.
Whether this was from an early religious
enthusiasm,
or to receive
the protection
of the convent, where he could study more
devotedly,
we
cannot
say.
This
same
convent having been the abode of Thomas
Aquinas three hundred years before, may
have
been
a factor in his
choice, for he
tells us he read with preference
at that
time the writings of Thomas Aquinas.
It
was in this convent he received
the mo-
nastic name of Giordano.
This name was
that of
one of
the immediate
followers
of St. Dominic, the general of the order,
and his receiving the same name perhaps
showed what hopes and wishes the order
had in the capabilities of their new mem-
ber.
Here for nearly thirteen years he stud-
ied, gaining for himself a vast knowledge
of ancient philosophy,
which is shown in
his works.
He evidently was a deep stu-
dent of Plotinus, Pythagoras, the Orphic
wisdom of Greece, as well.
It was in this

16
GIORDANO BRUNO
convent that this powerful
soul reached
independence of thought, under the pres-
sure of his automatic routine and deaden-
ing environments.
He
seems
early
to have troubled
his
censor while a monk.
He practised aus-
tere studies and his mind was held in fer-
vor of mystical thought, so that his censor
tried to divert him away from his higher
occupations, and even fetter his mind, try-
ing to change
the freeman in the service
of
virtue
to
the
slave
of
bewildering
hypocrisy.
Bruno did not fail to notice the weak-
nesses and peculiarities of his brothers of
the
order.
His
sharp
eye and cutting
tongue spared not their delinquencies, and
he soon turned his back on his compan-
ions, who, in turn, grew suspicious of him.
He tried to escape the childish
exer-
cises of the monks and their adoration for
relics.
Even during his novitiate
he was
threatened with an accusation in matters
of belief.
He had removed the pictures
of the saints from his cell, and only re-

EARLY DAYS
17
tained
the
crucifix.
When
one
of
his
brothers read a poem called "The Seven
Joys of Mary,"
he
asked
him
to read
something
more
sensible
and
rational.
For this he only received
a threat.
His
eighteenth year,
he mentions,
he
began to doubt the church doctrine of the
trinity.
He looked upon the Persons
as
attributes
of the Deity,
and referred
to
Augustinius
who considered
the
person
as a new thing and only used it with great
caution.
One may easily see him even at
this early date, the iconoclast and spiritual
crusader.
The impulse to doubt is often
a great blessing to the world.
Bruno's spiritual development received
a decisive impetus, nay, even the destiny
of his whole life was changed,
on his first
acquaintance with the works of Coperni-
cus.
"Copernicus' words knocked
early
at the portals
of the youth's
soul.
But
after twenty years the impression
of it
had still remained very vivid.
Suddenly
he seemed to see himself freed from fet-
ters.
The truths which he now believed to

18
GIORDANO BRUNO
see
yes, even to be able to grasp with
his hands, seemed to have been until now
imprisoned
in
the
fictitious
spheres
of
heaven.
How much he admired the large
soul of that German,
who, unconcerned
about the foolishness of the crowd,
had
remained
steadfast
toward
the
mighty
tide of
an
opposite
belief.
He looked
upon this new teaching as something re-
lated to his spirit, as an innate truth."
He could, he found,
use it freely, and
enlarged
upon
it.
With
bolder
confi-
dence,
he removed
the last bond which
even Copernicus
himself
had left stand-
ing.
His spirit took flight into
the in-
finity of the Universe.
And how brightly
shone the beautiful
world to him now!
What
a wonderful
possession, this new doctrine
!
With what
imagination and inspiration did his whole
being respond to it.
The feeble medieval
churchly
world
passed
from
his
mental
vision like a baneful phantasmagoria.
But
this new cosmology, this world-order, de-
manded
a reconstruction
of thought
a

EARLY DAYS
19
new metaphysic, nay, a new theology, and
in order to make them known
he recog-
nized this to be his life's mission, his true
vocation.
With what energy he devoted
himself
to his mission, that one who has
discovered his genius can only tell.
From Neo-Platonism
and the
deeper
writings of Nicolaus Von Cues
he took
principally the elements of his philosophy.
He recognized in this gifted author
an
especial affinity, who was only held back
from freer movement by his priestly garb.
The spirit of inner inspiration was much
needed in that day.
But to the muse of the cloister life, he
not only devoted
his
deep philosophical
studies and outlines, but also he added the
cheerful
occupation
of
writing
earnest
poetry.
The comedy "II Candelaio,"
and
certainly
also many of his sacred
songs,
which he later
used in the Dialogues of
"Gli Eroici Furori" (The Heroic Enthu-
siasts) , had their origin at this time.
This
fine work of Bruno has been excellently
translated into English by L. Williams,

20
GIORDANO BRUNO
in which the translator says it is an eth-
ical poern, portraying
"the struggles
of
the
soul
in its upward progress
toward
purification and freedom, and the author
(Bruno)
makes
use of lower
things
to
picture and suggest the higher.
The aim
of the Heroic Enthusiast is to get at the
Truth and to see the Light, and he con-
siders that all the trials and sufferings of
this life are the cords which draw the soul
upwards, and the spur which quickens the
mind and purifies the will.
The blindness
of the soul may signify the descent into
the material body, and visiting the Vari-
ous kingdoms'
may be an allusion to the
soul passing through
the mineral,
vege-
table, and animal kingdoms before it ar-
rives at man."
A satirical poem, "The Ark of Noah,"
dedicated
to the Pope, appeared in 1570,
which now, however,
is not to be anywhere
found.
We are acquainted only with its sub-
ject through
a later dialogue.
In it we
find "the donkey quarrels for precedence

EARLY DAYS
21
among the animals, which to lose is great
danger,"
referring
to the Pope
and the
worldly powers.
In his twenty- fourth year Bruno, after
consecration, read his first mass in the city
of
Campania,
and
remained
there
for
some time in the cloister of St. Bartholo-
mew's, and other cloisters of the province,
performing his priestly functions, reading
masses,
and
delivering
sermons.
After
three years he returned to the monastery
at Naples, evidently
disgusted with the
conditions he had encountered, for in his
work "II Candelaio" he pictures the fear-
ful demoralization which surrounded him
and arraigned
in strong satire the prin-
cipal groups
of stupidity, rascality,
and
hypocrisy.
Being of a frank and open character,
he was unable to hide his estrangement
to the church's doctrines.
He put his con-
victions before
some of his companions,
and with great zeal they hastened to lay
them before their superiors.
It seems he
had contrasted and evidently praised the

22
GIORDANO BRUNO
methods of the Unitarians, in expounding
their theological
doctrines, who referred
all things to the Father.
This and other
heretical propositions were brought to the
notice of the Holy Office, who quietly ob-
served
him,
and
next
threatened
him.
Warned of his
danger,
he
secretly, left
Naples and took the road to Rome, where
he
was
received
into
the
cloister Delia
Minerva.
Here a sudden though not un-
expected turn of events followed.
The provincial of the order, Fra Do-
menico Vito, raised against him, in one
hundred and thirty articles, the accusation
of
heresy.
Instructions
also
for
his
arrest had been forwarded from Naples.
Through letters from friends Bruno had
learned
that
some of his
concealed
and
forbidden
books left in Naples had been
found, namely, the writings from Chrys-
ostom
and Hieronymus,
but with
some
notes of Erasmus attached.
To have pos-
sessed such works could only make mat-
ters much worse.
So he quickly and res-
olutely laid aside the habit of his Order

EARLY DAYS
23
and wandered destitute and forlorn about
the Roman Campagna, his very sorry con-
dition being a safeguard against the rob-
bers and bandits who infested that land.
This was
in
1576, or the twenty-eighth
year of his age.
He broke his monastic
vows to pledge himself anew to truth and
to reason.
And now
commenced
the wanderings
of Bruno, lasting over fifteen years, and
which led him over half of Europe.
He
tried everywhere to make known his new
teachings
concerning
the
universe.
A
passionate
restlessness
within him never
permitted him to find a permanent place
for his work.
Reversals
and the
secret
doings of his enemies followed him.
His
life was a constant struggle with the guild
of scientists.
Wherever he went he made
enemies, partly through
his satirical
ad-
dress and possible hastiness.
His zeal car-
ried him along, and was a marked contrast
to the
indifference
of
his
opponents
in
the presentation of their science and phi-
losophy.
He said that other philosophers

24
GIORDANO
BRUNO
had not found out so much, therefore they
had not so much to guard and defend as
he had ; they may of course think less of a
philosophy
which was good for nothing,
or of one which they knew nothing of ; but
he who has found a hidden truth and is
charmed by its beauty, is jealous
that it
shall not
be counterfeited,
or neglected
or desecrated.
In
the
midst
of
this
restlessness
he
created his philosophical masterpieces,
the
"Italian
Dialogues,"
in which
his spirit
is expressed
so freely and richly.
The
Latin writings
are full of poetic verve
and
mystical
depth.
Besides
these
he
wrote a number of treatises on the Lullic
Art, which was founded by Raymundus
Lullus, a Spanish scholar of the thirteenth
century.
With the diligence peculiar
to
genius, he multiplied his powers in many
ways.
Returning
to Bruno's flight;
we find
him on a Genoese
vessel bound for the
Ligurian
port, hoping to find
a refuge
from his persecutors, but Genoa
was in

EARLY DAYS
25
a state of civil war, and also devastated
by pestilence.
Once more on the road to
exile we find him at Noli, on the Riviera,
a pretty little town nestling
at the foot
of high hills, crowned with feudal castles
and towers.
Here he instructed
boys in
grammar, to get sustenance, but this mod-
est employment
did not satisfy him, for
he delivered to some gentlemen of stand-
ing, lectures in astronomy, or the science
of the Sphere.
He expounded the system
of Copernicus
and with great
enthusi-
asm spoke of the plurality of worlds, and
the movement of the earth.
From Liguria, like Columbus,
Bruno
was banished.
In the humble schoolmas-
ter teaching grammar
there was nothing
to fear, but the nobles, bishops, and clergy
who attended his lectures suspected
her-
esy, and in a few months Bruno moved
on to Turin,
where
men of letters and
philosophy
were attracted by the gener-
osity of Duke Emanuele Filberto,
a war-
rior,
artist,
and scholar, and
a man of
strong
character.
But
the
Duke
had

26
GIORDANO
BRUNO
fallen into the hands of the Jesuits, and
Bruno,
who had hoped
to
teach in the
university,
found the place occupied by
his enemies.
L.
Williams,
in
his
introduction
to
"The Heroic Enthusiasts,"
tells us that
Tasso,
the Italian poet, had also sought
refuge in Turin,
driven by adverse for-
tune.
"Both
so great,
both subject
to
every species of misfortune
and persecu-
tion
in life,
and
destined
to
immortal
honors after their death, the light of ge-
nius burned in them both, the fire of en-
thusiasm flamed in each alike, and on the
forehead of each one was
set the sign of
sorrow
and of pain.
Both
Bruno
and
Tasso
entered the
cloister
as boys;
the
one joined the Dominicans,
the other the
Jesuits; and in the souls of both might
be discerned the impress of the Order to
which
they belonged.
Both
went forth
from their native place longing to find a
broader field of action and greater scope
for their intellectual powers.
The one left
Naples, carrying in his heart the Pagan

EARLY DAYS
27
and Christian traditions of the noble en-
terprises
and
the
saintly
heroism
of
Olympus and of Calvary, of Homer and
the Fathers, of Plato and St. Ignatius;
the other was filled with the philosophical
thought
of
the
primitive
Italian
and
Pythagorean
epochs,
fecundated
by his
own
conceptions
and
by
the
new
age.
Philosopher and apostle of an idea, Bruno
consecrated
his life to the development of
it in his writings and to the propagation
of his principles in Europe by the fire
of
enthusiasm.
The
one
surprised
the
world with the melody of his songs, being,
as Dante says, the fdolce sirena che i ma-
rinari in mezza al mare smagaS
he lulled
the anguish of lacerated Italy and gilded
the chains which bound her ; the other tried
to shake her; to recall her to life with the
vigor of thought; with the force of rea-
son; with the sacrifice of himself.
The
songs of Tasso were heard and sung from
one end of Italy to the other, and the poet
dwelt in palaces
and received
the caress
and smile of princes;
while Bruno,
dis-

28
GIORDANO
BRUNO
coursing
in
the
name
of
reason
and
science,
was
rejected,
persecuted,
and
scourged, and only after three centuries
of ingratitude, of calumny,
and of for-
getfulness,
does his country
show
signs
of appreciating him and of doing justice
to his memory.
In Tasso
the poet pre-
dominates over the philosopher
; in Bruno
the philosopher
predominates
over and
eclipses
the
poet.
The
first
sacrifices
thought
to form;
the
second
is careful
only of the idea.
Again, both are full of
a conception of the Divine, but the God
that the dying Tasso confessed
is a God
that is expected and comes not; while the
God
that
Bruno
proclaims
he
already
finds within himself.
Tasso
dies in his
bed in the cloister, uneasy as on a bed of
thorns; Bruno, amidst the flames,
stands
out as on a pedestal, and dies serene and
calm."
Our wanderer reached Venice
at a time
of great confusion and terror. The plague
which
had
devastated
the
entire
upper
Italy, with the exception of Turin, had

EARLY DAYS
29
reached this city.
Half of the inhabitants
had died
the aged Titian, almost a cen-
tenarian, succumbed to its deadly harvest.
Venice was at that time the book mart of
Europe,
and Bruno, fearless of the con-
ditions prevalent,
decided
to remain and
prepare for the press "The Signs of the
Times," hoping thereby to gain
a little
money for his few wants.
This work, like
all his writings
published
in Italy,
was
destroyed.
Next we find Bruno at Padua, but as
the university and printing
houses were
closed on account of the plague,
he did
not tarry
long.
Lodging
with
a
few
Brothers of his Order, he says "they per-
suaded me to wear the dress (Dominican)
again, even though I would not profess
the religion it implied,
because they said
it would aid in my wayfaring to be thus
attired; and so I got a white cloth robe,
and I put on the hood which I had pre-
served
when I left Rome."
After
three
years
of
wandering
he
finally
decided
to
leave
his native land.

30
GIORDANO
BRUNO
He hated dissimulation.
"Altiora Peto"
was Bruno's motto, and dressed as monk,
schoolmaster,
mechanic,
he had found no
resting-place
nowhere to call home, none
to understand him, all ready to denounce
him.
He viewed with sorrow the upper
classes, who were corrupt, illiterate,
and
uncultivated.
His country was overrun
with Spaniards,
and everywhere was the
petty tyrant.

CHAPTER II
THE EXILE
AND
WANDERER
"But yet for some in vain the call is heard,
Heedless and unprepared they mind it not."
G. B.
So he turned his back on Italy, which had
so mistrusted him.
He crossed the Alps
on foot and arrived in Geneva.
Here he
met an entire colony of Italian fugitives,
adherents of the reform doctrine, led by
the Marchese
Galeazzo
Carraciola, who
was a nephew of Paul IV.
The Marchese
received
the persecuted one in a not un-
friendly
manner.
He, however, obliged
him to exchange
the habit of the Domini-
cans for a more worldly dress, and Bruno
never again wore the habit of his Order.
How long
his sojourn
in
Geneva
was,
seems uncertain.
He supported
himself
by printing and correcting proof sheets.
From time to time he attended the serv-
ice of his reformed countrymen.
But his
independent spirit rebelled against a blind
31

32
GIORDANO
BRUNO
compulsory
and exacting faith.
He had
some
controversy
with
Antoine
de
la
Faye,
a member of the Academy.
This
gentleman
had
given
a
lecture,
and
Bruno, in a pamphlet, corrected, it is said,
twenty errors made in this lecture.
Both
Bruno and the printer were arrested, and
our philosopher
only gained
his liberty
b^ recalling the contents of his pamphlet.
It was made known to him that he must
adopt Calvinism or leave Geneva.
Soon
after
he
left
the
city
so
intolerant,
in
which twenty-six years before Severt had
mounted the stake.
Next he turned to France, and, reach-
ing Lyons, which
was
a city of refuge
against religious persecutions, he tried to
get work, but failed,
so went on to Tou-
louse.
Soon after he started private lec-
tures on The
Sphere or on Astronomy,
and receiving here the degree of Doctor,
competed for
the
chair
of
philosophy,
which, according to his own statement,
he
kept for two years.
His lectures were
many and varied.
He had to give up his

EXILE AND WANDERER
33
chair owing to the civil war under Henry
of Navarre, but not before he had seized
and
used
his
opportunity
to
introduce
and discuss the deepest questions.
What
is the origin
and
destiny
of humanity?
What of the soul
is it matter or spirit,
potential or real, individual or universal,
mortal or immortal?
Is man gifted with
a soul, or are all beings equally so ?
Great
questions,
indeed, were these in that dark
day.
Bruno
seems
to
have
given
great
thought
to these questions.
He taught
that
everything
has
a
soul.
One
great
Universal Mind penetrates all and moves
all things.
Nothing is lost, but all nature
is in a state of transmutation,
in the act
of becoming.
He taught the movements
of the earth, and the force, clarity, and
novelty
of
his
opinions
roused
up
the
lethargic clergy, and so he retired, going
to Paris, which he reached in 1587.
In the
two years in Toulouse he published "De
Anima" and "De Clavis Magis," both of
which were lost.

34
GIORDANO BRUNO
In Paris he tried to make use of his
rights as a graduate doctor, and at once
announced special lectures, choosing very
scholarly
subjects, for which he received
great applause.
He was greatly admired
for his eloquence and his remarkable mem-
ory.
He was offered a professorship, but
had to refuse it; as an excommunicant it
was
impossible for him to fulfil
certain
duties which this place required of him,
namely,
to attend
mass.
But
the reputation of his marvellous
gifts had reached the ear of King Henry
III, before whom he was summoned to
appear.
Henry was inclined to supersti-
tion, and he tried to find out if Bruno's
power of memory was a natural thing or
something magical.
Bruno suspected the
King, and succeeded in showing him that
the powers of his memory
were natural
and not uncanny.
Better to convince
the
King he dedicated
a pamphlet to his Maj-
esty,
entitled,
"The
Shadow
of Ideas,"
a dissertation of the Lullic Art, which was
his principal means in acquiring memory
and sustained eloquence.
This rare fac-

EXILE AND WANDERER
35
ulty enabled him to write the richest rep-
resentations of pictures
the most distant
to his present thought.
"The Shadow of
Ideas,"
however,
contained
more
than
writings on the Lullic Art.
In it he out-
lined
his philosophy,
and in style it re-
sembled much Plato's
Cave in the "Re-
public."
In light and shade, or in parable
and idea, there was an interchange show-
ing the relationship of ideas to things, and
things to their creative foundation.
Bruno
strongly emphasized
the unity of the uni-
verse, also the principle of unfoldment or
development ; how nature brings forth the
All from the All and gradually changes
the lower to the higher, and that the mind
has power to recognize the All from the
All, yet the mind of men comprehends the
truth only in a picture, therefore the ex-
pression, "The Shadow of Ideas."
In
Paris,
Bruno
gave
still
further
evidence of the versatility of his talents.
He published "II Candelaio,"
a comedy.
At the Sorbonne, philosophical
questions
were discussed with much freedom, show-
ing he was not exclusive either in philoso-

36
GIORDANO
BRUNO
phy or religion.
He favored neither the
Huguenot nor the Catholic faction.
For
this reason
did he obtain
the faculty of
lecturing
at
Sorbonne.
We
must
not
gather from this that Bruno was indiffer-
ent to religion.
He aimed for higher and
nobler things.
He professed a more pure
and complete faith, to wit, the love of hu-
manity and of wisdom.
Bruno, as we now
know, was not a man to conceal his ideas,
which he launched out with great fervor.
The
sudden conversion of
the King,
coupled with the free speaking of Bruno,
compelled him to leave Paris.
Equipped
with
a letter
of introduction
from
the
King to his ambassador
in London, Mi-
chel de Castelnau
de Manvissiere, Bruno
came over to England, not merely to be-
come acquainted with the land and the
people, but to impart the doctrines of the
Copernican
system and win them over to
broader thinking.
From Bruno's writing we find him in
Oxford,
where he introduced
himself
in
an independent manner by issuing a pam-

EXILE AND WANDERER
37
phlet on the "Thirty Seals."
He lectured
on the Pythagorean symbolism, on the im-
mortality of the soul, and on the new sys-
tem of Copernicus.
He naturally
made
enemies of the Oxford profession,
espec-
ially in his unheard-of
insistence
on the
numberless sun systems in an infinite uni-
verse.
The oppositions
to his teachings
were loud and stormy.
In a public de-
bate, given in honor of the presence of a
Polish prince, Johann a Lesco, in Oxford,
June,
1583, he defended his new cosmo-
logical doctrine to a few doctors of the-
ology.
He ascribed to himself the victory
in this debate, but the real outcome of the
same resulted in the restriction
again to
continue his lecture.
He repeatedly
ap-
peared alone at Court. Elizabeth was very
fond of showing her knowledge of Ital-
ian, and was greatly pleased with his con-
versation.
Bruno, on his part, eulogized
the Queen in the flowery style of the time,
naming her as the great Amphitrite.
He
approached very near, while visiting the
Court, the brilliant statesman, Sir Philip

38
GIORDANO BRUNO
Sidney.
To this noble soldier and poet
Bruno dedicated "Lo Spaccio della Bestia
Trionfante."
In London he made public a new book
entitled "Ash Wednesday," in which
he
attacked
the Oxford pedants.
He
was
obliged to keep himself concealed from a
London mob.
Yet, withal, the few years
he passed in England were the most pro-
ductive and happiest time of his life. All
his Italian writings which were saved were
edited and published in England.
Bruno was one of the first of the phi-
losophers of the newer age, who, like the
ancients,
treated scientific questions
in a
living
language.
In
his
dialogues
he
aimed to give a popular presentation in a
fluent
conversational
manner,
after
the
style of Plato.
His style is varied, his
means of expression facile, interchanging
with earnest and whimsical wit, and again
with
instructive
explanations,
vivid
de-
scriptions, satire or bitter reproof.
There
was no expression, whether sensational or
placid, of which he was not master.

EXILE AND WANDERER
39
In
his
Oxford
lectures, when only
thirty-six,
we find him anticipating
the
doctrines of Goethe and Darwin.
Speak-
ing of the soul, he taught that nothing in
the universe is lost, everything is in a state
of transformation;
therefore
body
and
soul, spirit and matter, are equally eter-
nal.
The body may dissolve, but becomes
transformed; the soul transmigrates, and,
drawing around
itself atom to atom,
it
reconstructs for itself a new body.
The
spirit which animates and moves all things
is One.
Everything differentiates accord-
ing to the different
forms and bodies in
which it operates.
Some animate things
are inferior by reason of the meanness of
the body in which they operate, others are
superior through the richness of the same.
In his teachings we see the idea later in
Darwin of the transformation of species,
and of the organic unity of the animal
world, and the alternation
from segrega-
tion to aggregation,
which
we know
as
death and life, is no other than change of
form.

CHAPTER HI
VISITS
THE
GERMAN
UNIVERSITIES
"The Divine Light is always in man, presenting itself
to the senses
and
to the comprehension,
but man rejects
it."
G. B.
THE recalling of the cultured French am-
bassador
Castelnau
naturally
brought
about Bruno's departure from England.
He returned
to Paris, but did not enter
the university; frequent
tumults' preced-
ing the civil war interrupted study, and
Bruno had
already
determined
to
visit
other
universities,
particularly
those of
Germany.
Before he departed he desired
to make a further onslaught on the cur-
rent doctrines of the philosophy of nature
taught in Paris.
In a thesis of one hun-
dred and twenty articles, which he handed
to the directory of the university,
he con-
tradicted,
with
pointed
exactness,
the
Aristotelian
philosophy.
In the expres-
sion of his sentences he attained a preci-
40

GERMAN UNIVERSITIES
41
sion which was scarcely even surpassed by
Spinoza.
Crowds of admirers were awak-
ened to an enthusiasm such as never had
been witnessed since the days of Abelard.
The printing of the theses was permitted,
their debate granted,
although
many of
them contradicted
the Catholic doctrine.
The debate took place during Pentecost,
May 25, 1588, not at Sorbonne, but in the
College
of
Cambray.
In
an
inspired
speech
Bruno,
through
the
interpreter,
Jean Hennequin, of Paris,
declared the
discovery of numberless worlds in the One
Infinite Universe. Nothing was more de-
plorable,
declared he,
than
the habit of
blind belief, for of all other things it hin-
ders the mind from recognizing
such mat-
ters
as are in themselves clear and open.
It was proof of a base and low mind for
one to wish to think with the masses or
majority,
merely
because
the majority
were the majority. Truth does not change
because it is or is not believed
by a ma-
jority of people.
However, he cautioned
that they should not be influenced by the

42
GIORDANO
BRUNO
fervor of his speech, but by the weight of
his argument and the majesty of truth.
Immediately after this impressive dis-
course Bruno started on his journey
to
Germany.
In Marburg
he
was
denied
permission
to lecture.
In Wittenberg,
"the German Athens," he found welcome.
Here
he
found Alberich
Gentillus,
his
countryman,
and one of the founders of
the
doctrine
of people's
rights.
Other
professors welcomed him and treated him
as their colleague, receiving him into their
homes, although, as he expressed himself,
he was unknown to them, nor recommend-
ed, and not even examined in their faith,
and was also an opponent to the philoso-
phy to which they adhered.
Only the Cal-
vinistic party of the university remained
unfriendly
to him, and these, after the
death of Kurfurst August, gaining pre-
cedency under his successor, Christian, he
was obliged to yield, after having held for
nearly two years a position enabling him
to
discourse
on
philosophy,
and
edit
a
number of pamphlets on mnemonics.

GERMAN UNIVERSITIES
43
In a farewell address to the senate and
the
university,
he
eulogized
the mental
greatness
of the Germans, who Jiad only
been known to him previously
as a people
of much drinking.
He prophesied that
they would lead in science.
"Here,"
he
said, "is being prepared
the soil for the
transplanting of wisdom from the lands
of Greece and Italy.
May Jupiter grant
that
the
Germans
may
recognize
their
strength and strive to aim for the highest,
and they will be no longer men, but rather
resemble gods, for divine and god-like is
their
genius."
He
also
highly
praised
Luther.
From
Wittenberg
Bruno
went
to
Prague,
where
he in vain
sought for a
position
and support.
He dedicated to
Kaiser
Rudolph II
a pamphlet
against
the mathematicians
and philosophers of
the present age.
In this he professed his
religion of universal love of man, a doc-
trine above all controversies.
This dedi-
cation only brought
him
a present from
the Emperor,
and after staying
several

44
GIORDANO BRUNO
months he resolved to go to Helmstadt,
where Duke Julius of Braunschweig had
founded
a
new
university.
Bruno
re-
mained here one year.
During this time
the Duke died, and the university "Aca-
demia Julia" honored the memory of its
founder with a solemn requiem, in which
Bruno took a part with an "Oratio Con-
solatoria."
In this oration Bruno said it
seemed not by mere chance, but by Provi-
dence, he had been directed here after so
many dangers and sorrows.
Banished
from his fatherland
for the
sake of truth, here he was received
as a
citizen and lived in freedom and safety,
while in his own country he had been ex-
posed to the hungry jaws of the Roman
wolves.
The hopes which
he had expressed
in
these
words
were
not
to
be
fulfilled.
This time it was the eager persecution of
a Lutheran
pastor which terminated
his
scarcely
commenced
activity.
The
Su-
perintendent of Helmstadt, Boethius, ex-
communicated him before the assembled

GERMAN
UNIVERSITIES
45
community,
and, as the rector of the uni-
versity, theologian Hofmann,
would not
or could not protect
him,
he was
again
obliged
to look around
for
a new loca-
tion.
He chose Frankfort-on-the-Main
(the
Leipzig of that time), with the intention
of finishing here his Latin works and hav-
ing them printed.
He at once communi-
cated with the well-known publishers, J.
Wechel and P. Fischer, but as the council
of the city denied him
the privilege
of
staying, they procured for him shelter in
the cloister of the Carmelites, on the out-
skirts
of
the city.
Here
he
was
inces-
santly at work, absorbed in his studies and
his writing.
All day long
he could
be
found in his cell either writing or medi-
tating
in feverish haste he worked, and
was only interrupted by a visit to Zurich
to instruct several young men there.
In
Germany particularly he showed the same
boldness and courage ; always treated with
scanty
welcome,
nevertheless
crowds
of
the intelligent flocked to his lectures.

46
GIORDANO BRUNO
"He was," said the prior of the Car-
melite cloister, "a man of universal mind,
skilled in all sciences, but
he had not
a
trace of religion"
possibly not a trace of
the religion of the said Carmelite
monk!
Especial mention should be made of his
works which appeared in quick succession
in Frankfort,
and which were dedicated
to Heinrich Julius, of Braunschweig,
"The Threefold Smallest," "The Monad,
Number, and Figure," and "The Immeas-
urability of the Innumerable Worlds." In
the first-mentioned writing he teaches that
the same power which develops itself into
the infinity of the universe, lives also in
the smallest particle.
It is one and the
same in the greatest and in the smallest.
The
universe
could
be
destroyed if
we
could destroy the most infinitesimal
part
of it.
Similar thoughts as these are found
in the writings of Leibnitz; even the ex-
pression of "monad of monads," meaning
the creative source of all things, has been
used also by Bruno, in his philosophy, but
in a deeper
sense.

GERMAN UNIVERSITIES
47
His work treating on "The Seven Lib-
eral Arts" was written at this time.
The fair at Frankfort was visited by a
great
many
foreign
publishers,
princi-
pally from Italy.
On one such occasion
Bruno made the acquaintance of the Ve-
netian
booksellers,
Bertano
and
Giotto,
and
the latter
brought
his
writings
to
Venice.
There in Giotto's
bookshop the
same fell into the hands of the young no-
ble, Giovanni Mocenigo, who with great
eagerness inquired
as to the whereabouts
of the author and desired to be instructed
by him in "the secret of memory and other
things that he knew."
Mocenigo was born of one of the no-
blest families
of Venice;
he
was
suspi-
cious,
bashful,
and a man of indecision,
and he became the tool in the hands of his
spiritual tutors.
He was well informed
of the secret workings of the Inquisition,
and this poor, miserable weakling forced
himself
into
Bruno's
life,
writing
him
again and again, full of fine professions of
friendship, inviting him to Venice, prom-

48
GIORDANO BRUNO
ising him protection
and
care.
It
was
Ciotto who forwarded the correspondence.
On Bruno's
return from Zurich
he
re-
solved to accept
the invitation.
He was
tired of his poverty,
his wandering life,
and he longed for his native country,
the
charm of which he knew
so well how to
describe in vivid colors.
It was natural
he should feel himself
safe in one of the noblest families
as
a
guest.
Could
he refuse
such
an
offer,
which at least for some time would save
him from poverty and sorrow?
He ob-
served nothing of the invisible net his ene-
mies had spread for him.
Having no ad-
vising friends,
absorbed
in his work, the
harmless
man, in spite of his combative-
ness and courageous temperament, made
a false step.
The wisdom and cunning of
life is withheld from those who would live
a hundred years or morel

CHAPTER IV
RETURNS TO ITALY
THE CONSPIRACY
"The true
aim in life should
be illumination,
the true
morality
the
practice
of
justice,
the
true
redemption
should
be the liberation of the soul
from
error
and its
union with God through consciousness."
G. B.
AT first all went well.
Bruno arrived in
Venice
in October,
1591, and settled in
rented quarters.
Mocenigo's
instruction
commenced,
but
was
not followed with
any regularity.
Bruno tried to instil into
his pupil's
head
the principles of logic,
the elements of mathematics, and the rudi-
ments
of mnemonic art
the pupil
dis-
liked study. It was commonly understood
in those days that superior intellect meant,
in other words, sorcery or magic.
Mo-
cenigo did not want dry study, although
Bruno
worked
with
great
patience
to
teach him.
Bruno found time to go to
Padua for several months to give private
49

50
GIORDANO
BRUNO
lectures to German students.
The studio
at Padua at that time was greatly cele-
brated.
Foreigners of note in science and
art were numbered
among
its
scholars.
Copernicus reached there in the beginning
of the sixteenth century, P. P. Rubens at
the end of the same.
A few months after
Bruno had left, Galileo called from Pisa
and commenced to teach, September, 1592
the prophet of modern science was fol-
lowed by its creator.
In March,
1592, Bruno again returned
to Venice, and now allowed himself to be
persuaded to live in the home of his stu-
dent Mocenigo.
Bruno was often seen in
the bookshops, in literary and philosophi-
cal
societies
which
grouped
themselves
around
Andrea
Morosini,
where,
too,
Bruno was a well-received guest.
When Bruno believed he had taught his
pupil all he called for, he intended to re-
turn to Frankfort in order to continue the
publishing of his works.
He desired per-
mission to depart, but Mocenigo, not sat-
isfied with the instruction
he had received,

RETURNS
TO ITALY
51
had in vain and ignorantly waited to be
initiated into the magic arts and sciences
which Bruno was supposed to know.
His
pupil
had fear mixed with
a desire
for
these studies, a fear because they were for-
bidden by his church.
He therefore
de-
nied
permission
for Bruno's
departure,
and hinted that he knew means to force
him to remain if he would not do so of his
own free will and pleasure.
Our
philosopher
must
have
been
greatly
deceived
regarding
his
position
when he answered that he feared not the
Inquisition, for he had not hindered any-
body
to
live
according
to
their
faith.
Bruno did not look upon
his
breach
in
the
Church
as
unamenable.
While
in
Toulouse
and Paris
he
had
repeatedly
made the attempt to reconcile himself with
the
Church,
and
at
this
very
time
he
placed
great
hopes
in
his
work,
"The
Seven Liberal Arts."
He
intended
to
forward this to the new Pope, Clement
VIII,
whom
he
thought
was
inclined
toward sciences, and hoped with it to re-

52
GIORDANO
BRUNO
gain
absolution
and
reinstatement
into
the communion with the Church without
being obliged
to return into
the Order.
But
events
were to develop differently
from any that he could foresee.
He in-
sisted
on
his
decision
to
depart,
and
ordered his things to be sent on to Frank-
fort.
Mocenigo did not dare to lose a mo-
ment in order to accomplish his treacher-
ous intentions.
The Holy Office would
have laid hands on Bruno immediately on
his arrival in Italy, but Mocenigo advised
certain liberty, saying that he could not
escape,
and Bruno might further
com-
promise himself.
Bruno could not escape ; he had intended
to leave next day, but early in the morn-
ing, while yet in bed, Mocenigo entered
the chamber on pretence that
he wished
to speak with him, and, calling his servant
Bartolo
and
five
or six gondoliers
who
were waiting without, they forced Bruno
to rise, and, conducting
him to a garret,
locked him in.
This was the beginning of

RETURNS
TO ITALY
53
his imprisonment and torture, which last-
ed eight
years.
The
day after,
in
the
company of his jailer, he was taken to the
prison of the Holy Office, and left there.
The depositions and denunciations
made
by his enemies were many. At the head of
the accusations
stands the doctrine of the
Infinity of the universe, the plurality of
worlds.
Bruno was charged with the as-
sertion that animal as well as human lives
proceeded
from a process of dissolution.
This may have been a misunderstanding
of his bold hypothesis of the natural ori-
gin of the organisms.
The philosopher
who accepted a manifest order of the hu-
man race knew also between
the animal
and human soul only stands
a difference
of development, all embodying
the
one
Being.
These and many other doctrines
were attacked.
The Court was opened promptly, and
most of the provinces of Italy were repre-
sented by their delegates in the early part
of the trial. Bruno, on being interrogated,
gave an account of his wandering life, his

54
GIORDANO
BRUNO
occupations and works.
He calmly and
with great dignity unfolded to this terrible
tribunal his doctrine, its principles and the
logical consequences.
Serenely he spoke
of the universe, how there were infinite
worlds in infinite space, how all things in
all forms
and
species were divine.
He
tried to explain the unity of all things,
the
dependence
and interdependence
of
all things, yet the existence of God in all.
With a spirit not broken by silence and
torture, he refused to recant.
After nine months in prison in Venice,
Bruno,
manacled,
was conveyed to
the
Bridge of Sighs, through the lagoons to
Ancona, where he remained incarcerated
until the prison of the Roman Inquisition
received
him.
The translator of "Gli Eroici Furori"
aptly quotes, in his excellent introduction
to that work, a poem that seems strangely
prophetical.
Did Bruno feel the loneli-
ness of his prison and the sufferings
in
the torture chamber when he wrote:

RETURNS
TO ITALY
55
"By what condition,
nature or fell chance,
In living death, dead life I live?"
Or yet further from the same work we
read:
"The soul nor yields nor bends to these rough
blows,
But bears, exulting, this long martyrdom,
And makes a harmony of these sharp pangs."

CHAPTER
V
THE
MARTYRDOM
"The
wise
man
fears
not
death,
yea
there
may
be
times
when
he
seeks
death,
or
at
least
goes
peace-
fully forth to meet it."
G. B.
THE day for the burning was fixed to take
place
February
16,
in
the
year
1600.
Clement VIII was about to hold his jubi-
lee, and pilgrims
and prelates from all
parts of Italy were present.
The morning arrived.
In the Campo
dei Fiori, a flower market, the pyre was
made.
Bruno,
scarcely fifty years old,
with thin, emaciated
face, with dark, fiery
eyes,
the
forehead
luminous
with lofty
thought, his poor body frail, showing signs
of fearful torture, his hands in chains, his
feet
bare,
in
early morning
with
slow
steps walked toward the funeral pile.
Signor Levi gives, in his book on the
life of Bruno,
an account of how he re-
56

MARTYRDOM
57
ceived the sentence of death passed upon
him.
"You, O judges! feel perchance more
terror in pronouncing this judgment than
I do in hearing it."
Bruno's holy mur-
derers could not comprehend him.
The sun shone brightly that early morn-
ing.
The fire was lighted.
The flames
leaped up, mixing with the beautiful sun-
beams.
The rest is easily told.
Bruno
stood in the midst of the flames with his
arms
crossed,
his
head
raised,
his
eyes
open.
A calm, steady look rebuked in its
gentleness his ignorant and misguided tor-
mentors.
When the flames curled cruelly
around him, he winced not.
Even in his
last moments
an idolatrous
monk thrust
through the blaze a crucifix, but the dying
martyr turned his head aside, more in pity
than aversion.
"He was the first in all the world who
died for truth without the expectation of
reward."
When the body was consumed
a monk
took a handful of the ashes and scattered

58
GIORDANO
BRUNO
them to the winds, and a month later the
Bishop of Sidonia presented himself at the
Treasury of the Pope and demanded two
scudi in payment for having degraded Fra
Giordano, the heretic.
So to thee, noble Bruno, thou prophet
of science, we in gratitude remember thee,
and in humble service again recall thy no-
ble thoughts.
It is to thy courage that
we owe a great debt of gratitude, for lay-
ing
the
foundation for positive
science.
Thou prophet of insight, the fatal fire that
freed thy immortal spirit is dead, but thy
spirit has already set many a heart aflame
with new ambition and has cheered many
a pilgrim on the Path !
Many men from many lands unveiled
a monument
to Giordano Bruno in the
center of Campo
dei Fiori
on
the
9th
of June,
1889.
The
bronze
statue
is
placed on the very spot where Bruno was
sacrificed.
The Pope, on that day, wept and flung
himself
into an agonized prayer before
the statue of St. Peter, grieving over the

MARTYRDOM

desecration of his holy city, prostrated for
hours because the memory of a brave man,
a philosopher and martyr had been justly

The

yet
abhors this so-called arch-heretic will, we

We are expectant

CHAPTER VI
BRUNO'S
TEACHING
OF
THE
SOUL
"The
mind which aspires
to
the Divine
splendor flees
from the society of the crowd and retires from the mul-
titude of subjects."
G. B.
"FoR
general
contemplation,
and uplift
of spirit," says Goethe, "Bruno's ideas re-
quire much to separate the pure gold from
the gross and uneven strains of other mat-
ter."
His
ideas
are
so
great
that
his
philosophy
can be compared with various
precious metals, the getting of which must
be systematically
pursued in order to do
justice to this gigantic thinker.
He might
justly
be
termed
a
second
Pythagoras,
whose
system
penetrates
the
social and
intellectual
history
of
Italy,
both
an-
cient
and
modern.
Bruno
resuscitated
these
doctrines,
giving
them
a
bolder
and clearer outline, and a more positive
direction.
61

62
GIORDANO
BRUNO
Pythagoras
taught
that
numbers
are
the beginning of things, or the cause of the
existence of material things ; they are not
final, but always changing their position
and attributes ; they are variable and rela-
tive.
Beyond and above all this trans-
formation,
there
is
the
Immutable,
the
All, the One.
The Infinite must be One, as one is the
absolute number; in the original One are
contained all the numbers ; in the One are
contained all the elements of the universe.
Bruno
elucidated
from
this
abstract
doctrine
fixed
principles,
giving
them
more distinct development.
One
is the perfect
number;
it is the
primitive monad.
From the One proceeds
the infinite series of numbers, which again
withdraw and are resolved into the One.
So from Substance, which is the One, pro-
ceeds the myriad of worlds, and from the
worlds
proceed myriads
of living
crea-
tures.
From the union of one with the
diverse is generated the universe.
From
this
absolute
One,
the
sum of

TEACHING OF THE SOUL
63
the
sensible
and intellectual
world, mil-
lions of stars and suns are produced and
developed.
Each sun is the center of as
many worlds, which are distributed
in as
many distinct series, in an infinite number
of concentric centers and systems.
These
numberless suns, with their planets, visible
or invisible, pursue their courses through
the immeasurable space.
Each sun sys-
tem is attracted or repelled, moved by an
internal passion or attraction.
Each turns
on its own center, and moves in a spiral
toward the
center
of the whole, toward
which center every sun and system of suns,
with their planets, tend with infinite pasj
sionate
ardor.
In this great
center re-
sides the sun of suns, the unity of unities,
the temple or altar of the universe.
In
this altar burns the vital principle of the
universe
called sometimes the sacred fire
of Vesta.
All constellations,
says Bruno,
are or-
ganisms,
infinitely
graded
in
size
and
form,
each
again infinitely
graded
and
compounded units, the fundamental unity

64
GIORDANO
BRUNO
of which and the last substratum is mathe-
matically the point, physically the atom,
and metaphysically
the monad. The num-
ber and variety of these monads is un-
limited,
as
is
also
the
number
of indi-
viduals which therefrom
arise, is infinite.
In the world of centers,
whether atoms,
monads, or suns, there is progression from
ascent to descent, or from spirit to that
which we call matter.
Every monad is in itself a living mirror
of the universe.
So in this entire form
the universe, slumber all monads, and all
manner of forms in which matter is ca-
pable of expressing
itself.
Every form
is the result of the indwelling soul, every
activity in nature
is nothing else but to
bring
into
existence
or
appearance
the
latent form.
All is thought, passion,
ar-
dor moving into form.
There is no end
to this form-producing faculty in nature,
it is infinite.
There is nothing without
life, nothing unsouled, nothing dead, noth-
ing inorganic,
but all, even the stone, is
from eternity
to eternity,
ever given an

TEACHING OF THE SOUL
65
uninterrupted motion and change,
either
in an ascending or a descending line.
Through all works the same spirit, the
same mind which dwells in and permeates
matter.
From the All
this unity which governs
variety,
from
the
movement
of
every
world around its sun, of every sun around
its central sun, the sun of suns, which in-
forms all with the rays of the spirit, with
the light of thought
is generated that
perfect harmony of colors, sounds, forms,
which charm the sight and captivate and
enthrall the intellect.
That which in the starry worlds is har-
mony
becomes in
the individual
virtue,
and in companies
of human beings,
law.
That which is light in the spheres becomes
intelligence
and science in the world of
the spirit
and in humanity.
We must
study the harmony that rules in the celes-
tial worlds, that we may understand and
deduce laws which govern our earth and
civil bodies.
Bruno goes on to show that the Bible,

66
GIORDANO
BRUNO
the sacred book of man, is the heavens;
there does man find God's word and law
^written.
In the science of numbers dwells har-
mony, and it is our duty to identify our-
selves with this harmony,
for from it is
derived
the
harmonic
law which
draws
men together in companies.
Through
the revolution of the worlds
through
space,
around
their
suns,
from
their
order,
their
constancy,
and
their
measure, the mind comprehends the prog-
ress and condition of men and their duties
toward each other.
Human souls are likened by Bruno to
lights,
distinct
from
the
universal
soul,
which diffuses over and penetrates every-
thing.
A purifying process guides each soul on
from one form to another, from one world
to another. The life of man is more than
one little life, with a few experiences
and
trials, it is to be an effort, nay a struggle
to reproduce on earth some of that good-
ness, beauty, and truth which are diffused

TEACHING OF THE SOUL
67 f
over the universe and constitute its har-
mony.
The process of growth is slow, and ap-
parently full of oppositions.
Just as our
earth becomes formed, changed,
and per-
fected, little by little, through cataclysms,
convulsions, by fire, flood, earthquake, and
eruptions, so it is with humanity. Through
struggles man is fortified and raised.
He
can go through all by the religion of phi-
losophy and thought.
It is the mystical
thread,
the guiding
star
through
every
transformation, occasion, and experience.
"The vulgar creeds of religious
bodies
have not," he said, "dared
to reveal the
Truth in its purity and essence."
"Rather would
the Church cover the
truth with allegories, with myths and mys-
teries, which they call sacred ; and human-
ity adoring the veil, failed to lift itself up
to
see
the
idea
behind
it.
Men
saw
through the teachings of the Church the
shadow rather than the light."
In his book, "Gli Eroici Furori," Bruno
lays
down
the
basis for
the religion of

68
GIORDANO
BRUNO
thought
and
science.
He would prefer
intelligence
and progress of the intellect
in the world of physics, metaphysics, and
morals, rather than the commonly accept-
ed so-called Christian perfections
(resig-
nation,
devotion,
and ignorance).
The
true aim of life should be illumination, the
true morality, the practice of justice, the
true redemption, the liberation of the soul
from
error,
and
its
union
with
God
through consciousness.
Bruno shattered the theories of histori-
cal
creation,
which
were
the
prevalent
ideas of his time. Nature was supposed to
be fixed, not as it grows, but as it eternally
is; nothing could change it but the arbi-
trary will of the Creator.
He started out with the Cosmos, the in-
finitely great; next
the Microcosm,
the
infinitely small.
"The body is in the soul, the soul in the
mind, and mind is in God," therefore the
life of the soul is the true life of man.
So
of all the faculties of man that which ex-
alts his nature
is Thought, for by it we

TEACHING OF THE SOUL
69
can contemplate and comprehend the uni-
verse, and thus in turn become Creators.
It is through the exercise of thought that
the
affections
become
purified,
and
the
will consequently strengthened.
Then is
true liberty gained in this union of will
and thought.
Our philosopher repeatedly claims that
blind faith, or supernatural
grace, or any
irrational
and
mystical
impulse
cannot
bring illumination, but only the strength
of a reformed intellect, and an enthusiasm
which
science and the contemplation
of
nature alone can give.
"The Divine
light
is always
in man,
presenting itself to the senses and to the
comprehension, but man rejects it."
How complex is the nature of man may
be gathered from the following extracts:
"The soul is in the body locally only as
intrinsic form and extrinsic moulder.
It
is
that
which
forms
the
members
and
shapes the material from within and from
without.
The body then is in the soul, the
soul in the intellect, the intellect in God.

70
GIORDANO
BRUNO
"The
intellect
either
is God
or
is in
God, as says Plotinus.
As in essence it
is in God, which is its life, similarly by the
intellectual
operation and the will conse-
quent upon such operation, it is related to
its light and its beatific object."
"The soul is in the body as a pilot in the
ship, and in so far as the pilot moves to-
gether with the ship he is a part of
it,
but
considered in his position as governor and
mover
is
not part but the distinct and effi-
cient cause.
So the soul of the universe
in so far as
it
animates and informs
is
an
intrinsic and formal part of
it,
but in so
far as
it
directs and governs,
is
not part,
is
not
a
principle but
a
cause."
"Intellect gives laws to sense and yet
deprives
it
of food."
"Intellect
is
a
pilgrim
and stranger;
sense
is
more domesticated
and at home."
"Soul complains that intellect in seek-
ing higher life
is
neglecting
lower,
and
seeks
to recall
the thoughts
to the
care
of the body."
"There
is
an intellect that gives being

TEACHING OF THE SOUL
71
to everything,
called by Pythagoras and
Timseus
'giver of the form';
a soul and
formal principle that makes and informs
everything,
called by some 'origin of the
form' ; one material of which is made and
formed
everything,
called by all 'recep-
tacle of the forms.'
'
"Sense
rises to imagination,
imagina-
tion to reason, reason to intellect, intellect
to mind ; then the whole soul is converted
to God and inhabits the intelligible world,
whence on the other hand it descends in
an inverse manner to the world of feel-
ing, through
the intellect,
reason,
imagi-
nation, sense, and vegetation."
"The Platonists say that the soul as to
its superior
part always
consists
of the
intellect, in which it has more of under-
standing
than of soul,
seeing
that it is
called soul only in so far as it vivifies the
body and sustains it."
"The order of diverse life which the soul
takes in various bodies, and the scale of
human powers, has
as many
degrees
as
that of nature (for man in all his powers

72
GIORDANO
BRUNO
shows all the varieties of being)"; Bruno
on this topic says :
"Therefore
from
the
attachments
it
may be known whether souls go high or
low, or whether they come from above or
below, whether they are going to be beasts
or rising
toward divinity,
according
to
their specific being, as understood by the
Pythagoreans, or according to the simili-
tude of
the
affections
only,
as
is
com-
monly believed
it not being proper that
the human soul should
become
the soul
of a brute, as well said Plotinus and other
Platonists."
"I have held and I hold that souls are
immortal and that they are subsisting sub-
stances
(that
is,
the intellectual
souls),
and that, speaking in
a
catholic manner,
they do not
pass from one body to an-
other, but they go either to Paradise or
to Purgatory or to Hell.
Nevertheless, in
philosophy
I
have reasoned that the soul,
subsisting without the body and non-ex-
istent in the body, may in the same way
that
it
is
in one body be in another, pass-

TEACHING OF THE SOUL
73
ing from one body to another, the which
if it be not true,
at least appears to be
the opinion of Pythagoras."
In this same work ("Gli Eroici Furo-
ri")
he aply portrays the relationship
be-
tween the soul of man and the soul of
the universe, the struggle
of the former
again to reach its real home.
How Bruno
tells this can
be gathered from the fol-
lowing passages :
"There
is
no
need
to
cast
the
eyes
toward the heavens, to raise the hands, to
direct
our
steps toward
temples,
or
to
intone
to images,
in order
that our
re-
quests may be more favorably considered ;
but we should enter into our inner self,
reflecting that God is nigh, with us, and
within us, more fully than the man him-
self can possibly
be, for He is the Soul
of
souls, Life of
lives,
and
essence
of
essences."
"He (man) will be present in the body
in such a way that the better part of him
will be absent, and he will by an indissolu-
ble bond unite himself
to divine things,

74
GIORDANO
BRUNO
considering himself to be too great to be
the servant and slave of his body, which he
ought not to regard otherwise than as a
prison which restricts his liberty, a viscous
substance
that
clogs his
wings,
a chain
that fetters his hands, a log that holds fast
his
feet,
or
a veil that clouds his sight.
But let him not be a slave, a captive, be-
slimed,
enchained,
idle,
deaf
and blind,
for the body which he leaves cannot any
more tyrannize over him, so that the spirit
proportionally
is placed above the body,
just as the corporeal and material world
is
subject
to Divinity
and
to
nature.
Thus
he will become strong
against ill-
fortune,
magnanimous
when
injured,
and
brave
in poverty,
persecution,
and
tribulation.
"Such is the virtue of contemplation, as
lamblicus observes, that sometimes it hap-
pens, that not only the soul abstains from
inferior acts, but it leaves the body com-
pletely."
"To see Divinity is to be seen by
it,
as
seeing
the
sun
is
concurrent
with being

TEACHING OF THE SOUL
75
seen by the sun.
Equally to be heard by
Divinity is just to listen to
it,
and to be
favored by
it
the same as to offer to
it,
for
from that One, the same and immovable,
proceed thoughts
certain and uncertain;
desires
ardent and satiated
;
and reason-
ings
learned and ignorant
;
according as
worthily or unworthily the man presents
them to himself by means of the intellect,
desires, and actions.
"The same pilot may be said to be the
cause of the sinking or safety of the ship,
according as he
is
present or absent from
it; with this
difference,
that whilst
the
pilot
by
his
ignorance
or skill
loses
or
saves the ship, the Divine power which
is
all in all, neither gives nor takes away
it
is
the conversion or rejection of
it
by
others
that
causes
the
difference
in its
effects."
"Our cognition will never be perfect in
so far as understanding
the highest object
is
concerned,
but only so far as our intel-
lect can understand it.
Let
it
suffice that
in this and other states there be present to

76
GIORDANO
BRUNO
him the divine beauty so far as the horizon
of his vision extends."
"Let it
suffice
that all make
the
at-
tempt, and that each does his utmost, for
the heroic nature is better content to fail
and
fall
nobly
in
a
high
undertaking
where it displays the dignity of its spirit,
than to be completely successful in an ig-
noble and low work ; better a dignified and
heroic death
than an unworthy and vile
triumph."
"The intellectual
power
is never con-
tent
nor
satisfied
with
comprehended
truth, but ever proceeds onward to truths
incomprehensible.
So
also
we
see
that
the will which follows the apprehension is
never satisfied with finite things.
There-
fore the essence of the soul is not related
to any other end than the font of its sub-
stance and being."
"Wherefore
shall
we
follow
the
true
morality and the right path, we shall be
magnanimous
despisers
of
those
things
which childish thinkers
esteem, and shall
become truly greater than the gods which

TEACHING OF THE SOUL
77
the blind crowd adores,
because we shall
become
true
contemplators
of
history,
which is written in ourselves,
and trained
executors of the divine
laws, which
are
hidden in the center of our hearts."
"This
is that philosophy
which
opens
out the senses, satisfies the spirit, enlarges
the intellect, and converts man to the true
bliss that he can have as man subsisting
in this and similar bodies ; for it frees him
from
solicitous
care
for
pleasures
and
from blind sentiments
of grief. ... ."

CHAPTER VII
GOD
AND
NATURE
"God is in every blade of grass, in every grain of sand,
and in every
atom that floats in the sunshine."
G. B.
"Ax first," says Bruno, "we are doubtful
and perplexed,
but
as we consider more
profoundly
the nature
and substance
of
that in which we exist unchanged, we shall
find that there is no death either for us or
any being; that nothing substantially
de-
cays, but that all things flowing through
infinite space only change in appearance;
and because all is subservient to the high-
est good, we ought not to believe or think
otherwise than that as everything is from
God,
so everything
is good,
makes
for
good and tends to good, that all is well,
makes for well-being
and tends
to hap-
piness."
Returning again to his idea of Nature
78

GOD AND NATURE
79
and God, we find him saying that
the mind expressed in Nature.
He is the
Nature
of all natures;
so we can in no
higher or worthier way worship him than
by searching for the law which keeps, up-
holds, and reconstructs this universe and
living in that law.
"In every organism, even in the small-
est, is the World-Mind present, but in no
one organism entirely.
If a man places
his limited ideas above or apart from the
world-idea, or if he subjugates to his own
desires the welfare of the whole, then evil
arises.
On the other hand, when the will
of the individual yields to the welfare of
the whole, good follows."
Every gain in the knowledge of natural
law
is,
therefore,
a
moral deed or act
;
for
it
promotes the activity to conform with
reason.
Nature should guide our human
reason,
but not that our limited
human
reason should guide Nature.
We can bet-
ter become acquainted with natural laws
when we go to the very source of Nature's
elements; and
these
are
the
atoms,
the

80
GIORDANO
BRUNO
monads and the minute.
In perceiving
the law of the minute and small, we cog-
nize nature
more fully,
as
the
smallest
thinkable
is a mirror of the universe.
Bruno
does not
claim
his
method of
philosophy
to
be
infallible.
"He
who
would try to persuade that there
is but
one way to obtain knowledge of Nature is
a haughty, ambitious, and envious fellow,
and only a fool or person without judg-
ment could lay claim to possess it alone.
There is not a philosophy
which has not
some good of its own, which may be found
in others."
He evidently is opposed to skepticism;
for he believes in the possibility of being
able to recognize all things, since the or-
ganism of human intellect
runs parallel
to the organization
of the intellect of the
all.
The foundation of all scientific knowl-
edge
is
evidence.
Search for
evidence.
Bruno would recall those who have turned
from
the mirror
of Nature,
and
closed
their ears to the common Mother- All for

GOD AND NATURE
81
the
purpose
of pursuing
a
few
foolish
pranks of thought.
"For things have not
come about by mere accident, but through
the determining mind."
From a contem-
plative
and
speculative
mind
the inner
may be judged by the outer appearance.
"The aim of all research
should be to
strive and discover from motion and di-
versity, rest and unity, and that is found
by means of mind activity which
serves
the inner and the most deep."
He never lets an opportunity pass with-
out giving loud
praise to experience as
the proof of all scientific knowledge.
"Why should we rest upon idle fanta-
sies, when we can be instructed where ex-
perience itself instructs
us?
Let us
see
how capable we can become through
ap-
plication,
in
experimenting,
comparing,
dividing,
and compounding,
and in ob-
servation.
Do we not often experience,
when we have a certain aim in view, a very
much nobler goal than the one at which we
had aimed?
How frequently it has hap-
pened to the alchemist that he has found

82
GIORDANO
BRUNO
something vastly better than the searched-
for gold."
Bruno
likens
Nature
to
a
countable
number, a measurable size, or an idea that
may be grasped by thought.
Reason, on
the other hand, is a counting
number, a
measuring size, and a thinking idea.
Since Nature acts according to the law
of necessity, she never errs ; and if at times
she were not to create monstrosities,
she
would err.
From
the
same necessity
it
follows
that
every accident
is
excluded
from the working of Nature.
She
acts
like an artist, and is herself
Source and
Substance of all art.
Nature is living art,
and a kind of intellectual
power of the
soul.
It
has
been justly
said
that
the
work of Nature is the work of intelligence.
As the sum total of all intelligence, she is
in possession of all activities.
"Nature
can
within
her
boundaries
make all from all, just as the intellect is
capable of recognizing All from All."
"Nature is the expression of truth, for
truth is only the law of reason observed in

GOD AND NATURE
83
all things.
Truth
is not alone physical,
but it is in itself the creating life force
and nature.
Nature is the greatest dem-
onstrator
of profoundest
secrets, for in
her visible forms we see the reasonableness
of ideas.
She is the Fire which Prome-
theus
secretly
stole from the Gods and
gave to men.
She
is the tree of knowl-
edge of good and evil, for she herself is
the reflection
of the Idea."
While
searching for Bruno's
idea
of
God, we find him apparently expressing
two
diametrically
opposed
ideas;
viz.,
God's
identity with Nature,
and God's
dominion
over Nature.
This perhaps is
due to the poetic and spiritual mind of
the poet-philosopher.
"Nature is the most glorious of Divin-
ity," and, "God demands and orders, and
Nature executes and fulfils His will."
We
read
again
of
"The
All-Being
which manifests itself in the beauty and
splendor of the Sun."
"God is the monad
of monads, the Substance of Substances,"
"The Divine Knowledge is the Substance

84
GIORDANO
BRUNO
of being in all things.
God is the all in all,
the one Light illuminating
all;
the One
Life giving life to all, in many gradations
descending from the higher to the lower,
and
ascending
from
the
lower
to
the
higher; as it is in the Universal, so it is in
the individual in the universe."
God
and
nature
is
an
oft-rehearsed
phrase
of Bruno.
"We study the splen-
dor of Deity and nature ; God and nature
are one and the same substance,
one and
the same power, one and the same space,
one and the same creating power.
Nature
is nothing more than God's power which
moves
matter in the
eternal
order
the
order we call Divine."
In speaking of matter, Bruno teaches
the following: "In the Universe are two
chief principles,
constant and eternal, the
principle of substance or matter, and the
principle of form.
These principles are
constant and promise immortality for the
body as well
as the soul.
But all forms
which proceed from Substance must re-
turn to Substance, so it seems as though

GOD AND NATURE
85
there were in reality nothing constant, but
matter has the power to send forms from
itself.
They are not taken from without,
but from its source.
All form is nothing
else
than
the indwelling
soul in things,
which is manifested or brought
into ap-
pearance. All things have a part of Mind-
Substance,
or
all
things
are
ensouled.
Soul is found in all things ; there is not the
smallest corpuscle, which
does
not
com-
prise this Soul-Light.
"The world's soul is the constituting,
forming principle of the Universe, ,its life
is in all things, and the soul form in all
things; the nature of all matter
is pure
spirit in action." If we recall the narrow
world-picture
of Bruno's
day,
we
shall
realize what an immense service was done
by
him.
He
was
afraid
of
no
conse-
quences.
Pope
and
Church
got
along
fairly well with Copernicus' system.
This
astronomer
freed
the
sun for
us,
and
raised our earth into a full swinging globe.
It remained for him to break the still
narrow
boundaries
of
the
(Qopernican

BRUNO
world, and give our world its completely
immeasurable space.
Bruno defended his
cosmological
teachings with great vigor
and
courage.
The
entire
world
was
against him in its thought.
Copernicus
had taught the Aristotelian Infinity of the
world's edifice, by keeping
the fixed-star
sphere.
Bruno
declares,
"For
us
consists
the
Universal
sphere
as
a
single,
all
over-
spreading, infinite, immovable continuum,
in which numberless spheres or particular
worlds
exist.
There is but one sky, only
one immeasurable world's space, one ma-
trix,
qne universal
connective,
one ether
region
through which
the whole moves.
In this become visible innumerable
stars,
constellations, world bodies, and suns, and
this gives us a right to reason that there
are numberless others.
These immeasur-
able and unnumbered moving
bodies
are
the
necessary
media,
through which
the
formless
glory
of
God
endeavors
to
manifest
itself,
in a form, or corporeal
manner."

GOD AND NATURE
87
"Of these great constellations our earth
is one, yet not a single one is the center,
for the universe is in all directions equally
immeasurable.
For neither
the sun nor
in the sun, the earth or in the earth, nor
in any region is the center of the universe.
To every living
being the center is the
middle round which it revolves,
so there
are as many centers
as worlds swung by
their own weight ; they move freely in the
ether, attracting each other by the mind
forces which dwell in each."
"The earth and all other constellations
have their own life principle, which is none
other than their own soul, which again is
but
a part of
the World
Soul."
This
creating World- Soul finds infinite delight
in propagating infinitely graded forms of
life; the object of these diverse
expres-
sions is to delight the mind, and call into
manifestation
an infinite number of ideas
to make true the world of reason.
For
where
there
are
variety
and
diversity,
there are also
gradation,
order,
system,
harmony
and
concord,
and
in
the
har-

88
GIORDANO
BRUNO
mony of the opposites
rests
the beauty
of
the
whole.
Of
course
there
is
har-
mony
of
parts,
only
in
beholding
the
whole.
Even
the
thinkable
smallest^
has in the universe the highest destiny;
viz.,
the
task
of
subjugating
itself
as
a
part
of
the
whole,
that
the
whole
may
harmoniously
balance
and
unite.
Nothing in the universe is so small that
it cannot add something to the keeping
and perfecting of the highest.
There is
no evil for anybody or anything, which is
not
a good for somebody.
To one who
always
considers
the
whole,
nothing
is
hideous or evil, nothing inharmonious
in
its diversity.
To see the perfect depends
on
how
well
we
hold
the
contrasts
in
check; nature is like a music master, har-
monizing higher and lower tones in a mag-
nificent symphony.
The world harmony
can never pass away, no more than the
Eternal can perish."
It is to Bruno we give credit for having\
discovered the rotation of the sun on its
own axis.
He was not afraid to proclai]

GOD AND NATURE
89
that all constellations
beyond the orbits
of Saturn (Uranus and Neptune not hav-
ing then been discovered) were suns, each
having a separate system.
These suns are
called fixed stars, because they seem mo-
tionless and retain their relative position
in the heavens,
but in reality they have
their motions.
In claiming this discovery,
Bruno rejoiced greatly, as later in his day
the truth was verified by the calculations
of astronomers.
In speaking of comets, he claimed they
are a special
species of planets, differing
only from the real planets in that they
seldom appear, because their path is in an
opposite direction
to our vision and the
sun.
His speculations in astronomy have
been
more
than
once
verified.
Bruno
claimed that all the planets of our system
were not yet discovered.
Bruno seems to have anticipated
"the
unit development of all organic beings,"
or the doctrine of evolution as taught by
Darwin.
"Matter is in a constant state of fleet.

90
GIORDANO
BRUNO
No body is to-day what it was yesterday.
This motion is nothing more than the outer
appearance of the soul in all things.
In
all things, even the smallest, is an indwell-
ing soul, which gives it power of thinking,
and sensation, and the desire to strive and
maintain
that which is most useful to it
and to the whole."
This all-penetrating
ensouled intelligence appears in lower or-
ganisms as blind or sleeping, next showing
more of its natural characteristics
as in
the animal.
The third step in gradation
is seen in the inborn reason, manifesting
itself in an organic mould." All of which
seems to point to a scale of evolution in
Bruno's doctrine of development.
Speaking of art, our philosopher
re-
turns to Nature,
claiming
her to be the
substance and source of all arts.
"Nature
herself is a living art, and a living power
of the soul.
Art is the imitator of Na-
ture; it follows her footprints.
The aim
of art is to express the beautiful,
and the
beautiful is seen in the harmony of oppo-
sites. If the world of forms were similar,

GOD AND NATURE
91
it would never have been beautiful; it is
in the variety that we have beauty.
In
Nature's contrasts have we action, reac-
tion,
motion
and
differentiation,
order,
harmony,
and beauty, thus pleasing
the
poet, the philosopher, and the painter.

use of lower
things to
picture and suggest the higher.
His one
great object and aim is to get the Truth
and see the Light.
All trials and suffer-
ings tend to draw the soul upward, and
purify
the will.
The first three poems
here given are taken from Frith's trans-
lation, which seems less involved than that
of
other
translators.
Bruno's
peculiar
style makes translation
one of great diffi-
culty; yet withal,
the perusal will repay
the careful reader abundantly.
One read-
ily
sees Bruno to
be
impulsive,
highly
imaginative, and never heavy, but always
spontaneous.

Come Muse, O Muse so often scorned by me,
The hope
of sorrow
and the balm of care,
Give to me speech and song, that I may be
Unchid by grief; grant me such graces rare
As other ministering
souls may never
see
Who boast thy laurel, and thy myrtle wear.
I know no joy wherein thou hast not part,
My speeding
wind, my anchor,
and my goal.
Come, fair Parnassus, lift thou up my heart,
Come, Helicon, renew my thirsty soul,
A cypress crown, O Muse, is thine to give,
And pain eternal;
take this weary
frame,
Touch
me with fire, and this
my death shall
live,
On all men's life, and in undying fame.

Where

And dost grant me by thy grace complete,
Fortune to spurn, and death; O high retreat,
Which
few attain, and fewer yet forsake!
Girdled with gates of brass in every part,
Prisoned
and bound in vain, 'tis mine to rise,
Through
sparkling
fields
of air to pierce
the
skies,
Sped and accoutered by no doubting heart,
Till, raised on clouds of contemplation vast,
Light, leader, law, Creator, I attain at last.

THE
WINGED
HEART
(The Soul in search of greater
powers.)
My solitary bird!
away unto that region,
Which
overshadows
and
which
occupies
my
thought,
Go swiftly, and there nestle ; there every
Need of thine be strengthened,
There all thy industry and art be spent!
There be thou born again, and there on high,
Gather and train up thy wandering
fledglings,
Since adverse
fate has drawn
away the bars,
With which she ever sought to block the way.
Go! I desire for thee a nobler dwelling-place,
And thou shalt have for guide a god,
Who
is called blind by him who nothing sees.
Go
! and ever be by thee revered,
Each deity of that wide
sphere,
And come not back to me till thou art mine.
In this poem, the progress of the soul
is illustrated by a winged heart, which is
sent out of the cage in which it lived idle
and quiet, to make its nest on high and
bring up its fledglings,
its thoughts;
the

time being come in which those impedi-
ments
are
removed,
which
were caused
externally in a thousand different
ways,
and internally by natural feebleness.
He
dismisses
his
heart
then
to make more
magnificent
surroundings,
urging him to
the
highest propositions
and intentions,
now that those powers of the soul are more
fully fledged, which Plato signifies by the
two
wings,
and
he
commits him to the
guidance of that god, who, by the unsee-
ing crowd, is considered insane and blind ;
that
is,
Love, who by the mercy and favor
of Heaven has power to transform him
into that nature toward which he aspires,
or into that state from which,
a
pilgrim,
he
is
banished.
Whence he says, "Come
not back to me till thou art mine,"
and
not unworthily may
I
say with that other
:
Thou hast left me, oh, my heart,
And thou, light of my eyes, art no more with
me.
This describes the death of the soul, which
by the Kabbalists
is
called the death by

kisses,
symbolized in the Song of Solo-
mon, where the friend says :
Let Mm hiss
me with
the kisses of his mouth,
For when he wounds
me,
I suffer with a cruel love.
By others it is called sleep; the Psalmist
says:
It shall
be, that I give sleep unto
mine
eyes,
And mine eyelids shall slumber,
And 1 shall have in him peaceful repose.
The soul then is said to be faint because
it is dead to itself, and alive in the object.
V
THE
WILL
The captain
calls his warriors to arms,
And at the trumpet's
sound they all
Under one sign and standard
come ;
But yet for some in vain the call is heard,
Heedless and unprepared,
they mind it not.
One foe he kills, and the insane unborn,
He banishes
from out the camp in scorn.

98
GIORDANO
BRUNO
And thus the soul, when foiled her high designs,
Would have all those opponents dead or gone;
One object only I regard,
One face alone my mind does fill,
One beauty keeps me fixed and still ;
One arrow pierced my heart, and one
The fire with which alone I burn,
And toward one Paradise I turn.
The
captain
here
is
the
human
will,
which dwells in the depths of the soul with
the small helm of reason
to govern and
guide the interior powers against the wave
of natural impulses.
He, with the sound
of the trumpet
that
is,
by fixed resolve
calls all the warriors or invokes all the
powers; called warriors because they are
in continual
strife and opposition;
and
their
affections,
which
are
all contrary
thoughts, some toward one and some tow-
ard the other side inclining, and he tries
to bring them all under one flag
one set-
tled
end
and
aim.
Some
are
called in
vain to put in
a
ready appearance, and
are chiefly those which proceed from the
lower instincts, and which obey the reason

either not at all, or very little ; and forcing
himself to prevent their actions
and con-
demn
those which
cannot
be prevented,
he shows himself
as one who would kill
those and banish these, now by the scourge
of scorn, now by the sword of anger.
One
only is the object of his regards, and on
this he is intently fixed; one prospect de-
lights and fills his imagination, one beauty
pleases, and he rests in that, because the
operation of the intelligence is not a work
of movement
but of quiet;
from thence
alone
he derives that barb which, killing
him, constitutes the consummation of per-
fection.
He burns with one fire alone;
that
is,
one affection consumes him.
He
knows
one
Paradise,
that
is,
one con-
summation,
because Paradise commonly
signifies
the end; which
is
again
distin-
guished from that
which
is
absolute in
truth and essence
from that whicK
is
so
in appearance and shadow or form.
Of
the first there can be only one, as there can
be only one ultimate and one primal good.
Of the second the modes are infinite.

Although to many pains thou dost subject

Yet do I thank thee, love, and owe thee muci

And then dost take my heart and master it.
Thus true it is, that I, on earth, adore
A living object,
image most beautiful
of God,
Let him who will think that my fate is bad,
That kills in hope and quickens in desire.
My pasture
is the high emprise,
And though
the end desired be not attained,
And though my soul in many thoughts is spent
Enough that
she
enkindles
noble
fire,
Enough that she has lifted me on high,
And from ignoble crowd has severed me.
