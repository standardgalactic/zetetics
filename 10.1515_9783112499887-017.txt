Effective Hamiltonian 
for the Two-Dimensional Arbitrary Spin Ising Model

J. SZNAJD 
A method of the reduction of the generalized arbitrary spin two-dimensional Ising model to the 
spin-half Ising model is presented. The method is demonstrated in detail by calculating the effec-
tive interaction constants to the third order in a cumulant expansion for the triangular spin-one 
Ising model (the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model). 
Es wird eine Methode der Zurückführung des verallgemeinerten zweidimensionalen Ising-Modells 
für Spins beliebiger Größe auf das Ising-Modell für den Spin 
dargestellt. Durch die Berechnung 
der effektiven Wechselwirkungskonstanten bis zur dritten Ordnung in der Cumulantenentwick-
lung wird die Methode für ein dreieckiges Spin-l-Modell (das Blume-Emery-Griffiths-Modell) aus-
führlich demonstriert. 
1. Introduction 
The Hamiltonians describing a considerable number of magnetic systems, besides the 
linear terms, have higher-order terms in powers of the spin variables. The existence 
of such terms can be caused, for example, by crystal field or coupling of the spin and 
elastic degrees of freedom. As for the crystal field, due to single-ion interactions, they 
can be easily considered by the standard methods, the higher-order interactions 
between various spins need some additional assumptions or rather approximations 
even in the molecular field theory (MFA). In order to avoid these difficulties we have 
proposed a simple method which allows us to reduce the arbitrary spin Ising model 
to the spin-half Ising model. It is obvious that after such a reduction the higher-order 
interaction constants may only renormalize the bilinear interaction constants and 
create the many-site interactions. 
The most general Hamiltonian describing an arbitrary spin Ising model, with 
nearest-neighbour two-spin and single-ion interactions, can be written in the form 
Knn'SfSf 
, 
(1) 
<{_/) nn' 
where the powers n and n' run from 0 to 2S, and the spins have values —2S, 
—2(S — 1), ... , 28. The usual factor —ß = —l/kBT 
has already been absorbed in 
the Hamiltonian. 
Specific examples of the model (1) were studied by several methods from MP A to 
renormalization group approach (RG) in real space. In the MF A one has to introduce 
2S parameters (molecular fields) which describe 2S kinds of ordering (dipolar 
(Si), 
quadrupolar — (S^), etc.) and assume that each of these parameters is independent 
of the others [1].

The RG method was used to study the model (1) with S = 1 (Blume-Emery-
Griffiths (BEG) model) [1], by Emery and Swendsen [2] who proposed the modified 
form of Migdal's recursion formula appropriate for higher spin Ising models. They 
wrote the Hamiltonian in the form 
X = £ J(S„ S,) + 2 G(Sl) 
(2) 
ij 
k 
and chose J(Su Sj) so that it vanishes if St = S}. Then the two-spin interactions, that 
ought to be small quantities, are left out, while one retains the single-ion interaction 
G{Si). The use of this procedure, according to the authors, is relatively easy for S = 1. 
However, it is much more complicated for higher-spin models and, of course, this 
method is charged with all disadvantages of the Migdal-Kadanoff renormalization 
procedure. 
According to universality the critical singularities are independent of the value of 
S or, in other words, of the number of the spin states. Thus we propose the alternative 
method to study the critical behaviour of the generalized Ising model by reducing 
the Hamiltonian (1) which describes the (2S + l)-state Ising model to the two-state 
Ising model. Such a reduction ought to lead to the effective Hamiltonian which not 
only describes in a proper way the critical behaviour of the original system (which is 
obvious because all Ising models with given d belong to the same universality class), 
but predicts the critical temperature and an eventual tricritical point as well. 
2. Transformation 
We consider a triangular lattice with a spin Si = —2S, ... , 2S on every site. Let us 
substitute, in thought, 2S elementary spins s" = ¿ 1 (a = 1, 2, ... , 2S) for each orig-
inal spin Si. The original spin St takes, of course, each value —2S, ... , 2S with the 
same probability whereas the state with given value of the sum £ 
s t occurs n times, 
where 
a 
= « ( 2 Sf. S) - / , 
" 
V 
(3) 
These imaginary elementary spins create the site cell with 2S internal states. Now 
we can treat this upgrowth as the cell in the Niemeyer-van Leeuwen sense [4] and 
find the effective site Hamiltonian 3€'(st) by summing over the internal states, taking 
into account two weight factors, 
= 
(4) 
i 
a. 
which depends on the original spin S and site-cell spin configurations {s}, and P(s, s) 
(see [4]), 
P(°,*) 
= n | [ l + «!<({*«})] 
(5) 
i 
which depends on the effective site spin and site-cell spin configurations {5} and {«}, 
respectively. 
Then the transformation is defined by 
exp X\s) = £ P{s, s) C(s, S) exp X(St 
— 2 
) . 
(6) 
{»} 
« 
Thus, the transformation (6) is composed of two operations: substitution of the 
original spins St by the set of elementary spins {«¿} (splitting) and summation over 
the internal configurations (reduction).

The similar mapping of the spin-iS Ising model onto a spin— Ising model was 
proposed by Berker [5], who considered the models with many-site interactions 
described by the Hamiltonian 
X ( { p t } ) = 
X KaHa , 
lia = Il lit- 
( 7 )

i 
The author defined a new variable at at each lattice site, 
ffi = sgn (jUi) for 
fit =j= 0 
(8) 
and found the effective Hamiltonian X'(ot) 
after the summation over all configura-
tions {fii} of the spin-$ variables which are in accordance with the specified con-
figuration {<Ti} of the spin--i- variables, with the provision added that for integer S, 
= 0 is to contribute equally to 
= + 1 and to Oi = —1, 
exp 3€'(oi) = 
2 
exp J e ( { ^ } ) .

For the models under consideration in this paper, that include only the nearest-
neighbour two-spin interactions, Berker's procedure is equivalent to ours when 
Knn' = 0 unless n = n' = 1 (1), i.e., when only bilinear terms are taken into account. 
However, we are, first of all, interested in the influence of the higher-order terms on 
the critical behaviour. 
3. Application to the S = 1 Model 
As an example of the use of the transformation (6) consider the spin-1 BEG model 
for which the Hamiltonian (1) can be written in the well-known form

In order to find the effective Hamiltonian

methods, say the cumulant approximation. Splitting of the Hamiltonian (12) into

we adapt to this problem the Niemeyer-van Leeuwen method [4] defining, in our case, 
the zeroth average as

It is easy to find that 
2 exp je0 =

and for the calculation of {VyVti •••) we use the following averages:

of the Hamiltonians, which in [5] are normalized so that the maximum interaction 
between two parallel spins remains constant for each value of spin (K —• K/(2S)2). 
For D large and negative / -» — 1 and K\2> 
0 (all original spins are in the state 0) 
and for D large and positive / —• 1 and K^ —>• iK (all original spins are in states i 1). 
For the spin -§- (half-integer) the result is, of course, quite different [3] and K ^ can 
change only from K (for D —> — oo) to 9K (for D —• oo). 
Similarly as was done in [5] we can, in the case under consideration, calculate the 
critical interaction KQ using the results of Niemeyer and van Leeuwen [4]. From the 
first-order cumulant expansion they lead to the following equation for Kc: 
(
pZbK* 
J_\2 
K° = L 0 9 6 8 ' 
<20> 
where Kc ->• ~ Kc (for comparison to Berker's result [5]) and b = DjK. As mentioned 
above for 6 = 0 relation (20) gives for Kc the same value as was found by Berker, 
K° = 0.617, whereas for large and positive D, Kc — 0.274. When b<dt« 
—0.33 
(20) is not fulfilled for any value of K°. So at b = dt the critical line meets a first-order 
phase transition line. This latter cannot be, of course, calculated by our method. 
It is obvious that in the higher-order expansions the transformation (6) introduces 
to the effective Hamiltonian further-neighbour and many-site interactions even 
though there have been only nearest-neighbour two-spin interactions in the original 
Hamiltonian. Generally the new effective interaction constants, for the model under 
consideration, can be written in the form

The second-order term of the cumulant expansion has the form

It is easy to see that the relevant contributions to the effective Hamiltonian are given 
by the following terms:

where the rules (17) were used. The first term contributes to the nearest, next-
nearest, and third-neighbour two-spin interactions 
Kf>, and K(.p with factors 
2, 2, and 1, respectively, whereas the second term only to the nearest-neighbour two-
spin interaction with the factor 10. 
In the third order seven interaction parameters come into play, five two-spin 
coupling parameters from nearest- to fifth-neighbour and two four-spin parameters 
(for eight types of interactions). The typical figures which lead to the latter ones are 
presented in Fig. 1.

4. Conclusion 
We have demonstrated how a simple Niemeyer-van Leeuwen-type transformation 
can be used to reduce the Hamiltonian appropriate for the generalized arbitrary spin 
Ising model with nearest-neighbour two-site interactions to the effective spin-half 
Hamiltonian. As an example we have considered the Hamiltonian of the well-known 
BEG model with single-ion, bilinear, and biquadratic interactions on the triangular 
lattice. By using the third-order cumulant expansion this Hamiltonian was reduced 
to the spin-half effective Hamiltonian with two-spin from nearest- to fifth-neighbour 
and four-spin interactions. In the first-order cumulant expansion both single-ion (/)) 
and biquadratic {A) terms affect in the same way the critical temperature which 
depends only on D = 2(12^4 + D). In the higher-order expansion the dependence is 
more complicated but the critical temperature as a function of D and A can, of course, 
be found by numerical calculations. So, for example, Fig. 3 shows the critical tempera-
ture as a function of the reduced single-ion anisotropy constant d = 2D/K for various 
values of a = 2A/K obtained from the second-order cumulant expansion (where we 
used the seventh-cluster NvL's solution [4]). It is easy to find that for d = 0 and 
a = 0 we get Berker's result 1 ¡Kc = 2.597. The tricritical points, in this approxima-
tion, are located at d= 
-1.32, -0.73, - 0 . 1 5 and l/if c = 1.3, 1.25, 1.22 for a = 
= 0.2, 0, and —0.2, respectively. 
It is clear that for spin -f- (A = 0) the continuous phase transition occurs for 
arbitrary values of d and the appropriate phase diagram is shown in Fig. 4. 
It is straightforward to apply our method to Hamiltonians with higher-spin interac-
tion although the calculations become more tedious.
