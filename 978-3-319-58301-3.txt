Prologue
A revolution in our scientiﬁc understanding of the physical world occurred during
the twentieth century. That upheaval revised our idea of science itself, and thrust
our conscious thoughts into the dynamical process that determines our physical
future. During the preceding two centuries, from the time of Isaac Newton, our
conscious experiences had been believed by most scientists to be passive witnesses
of a clock-like physical universe consisting primarily of tiny atomic particles and
light, that evolves with total disregard of our mental aspects. Our conscious
thoughts had, for two hundred years, been exiled from science’s understanding
of the workings of nature. But during the ﬁrst quarter of the twentieth century that
earlier “classical” theory was found by scientists to be unable to account either for
the observed properties of light, or for the plethora of new empirical data pertaining
to the dynamical properties of actual atoms such as Hydrogen and Helium. A better
theory was needed!
In 1925 Werner Heisenberg, the principal creator of quantum mechanics, con-
cluded from an analysis of the data of atomic physics that the basic precepts of the
prevailing classical theory were profoundly wrong, and that the root of the difﬁ-
culties lay in Newton’s ascribing to his conception of atoms certain properties that
empirically observed atoms do not possess. The ﬁrst of these purely ﬁctional ideas
is that each atom has at each instant of time, a tiny well-deﬁned location in 3D
space. The second is that the evolving physical properties are completely deter-
mined by prior physical properties alone, with no input from our conscious
thoughts. These latter “mental” realities were assumed, in the classical theory, to be
completely determined by the physically described properties of the associated
brains and nervous systems. Hence they do not, in that theory, constitute extra free
variables. But in quantum mechanics the evolution of the physically described
aspects is not fully determined by physically described properties alone: our con-
scious experiences enter irreducibly into the dynamics!
The basic principle that guided Heisenberg to the successful new theory was that
it should be based on properties that we can choose to measure. These choices on
the part of conscious agents are “free choices”—from amongst the many possi-
bilities allowed by the theory—of which measurement to actually perform. Here the
ix

adjective “free” means that the choices are not determined by purely “physical”
laws alone. They are determined in part by irreducible mental aspects of
psycho-physical observers. The observer’s “free choices” are thus non-physical
inputs into the physical dynamics! Our minds are not mere side effects of material
physical processes: Our Minds Matter!
Heisenberg’s study of the data of atomic physics convinced him that the
empirical data of atomic physics cannot be reconciled with the naïve realism of
classical mechanics, which considers a person’s perception of an external physical
property to be a mere causally inert by-product of the observational process of
creating a brain/body representation of that property. According to that classical
scenario, nature goes to the great length of creating a seemingly new kind of stuff,
mental reality, which, however, has no physical function or effect. Such an
arrangement seems unnatural.
Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, assigns to mental reality a function not
performed by the physical properties, namely the property of providing an avenue
for our human values to enter into the evolution of psycho-physical reality, and
hence make our lives meaningful.
Quantum mechanics accounts with fantastic accuracy for the empirical data both
old and new. The core difference between the two theories is that in the earlier
classical theory all causal effects in the world of matter are reducible to the action of
matter upon matter, whereas in the new theory our conscious intentions and mental
efforts play an essential and irreducible causal role in the determination of the
evolving material properties of the physically described world. Thus the new theory
elevates our acts of conscious observation from causally impotent witnesses of a
ﬂow of physical events determined by material processes alone to irreducible
mental inputs into the determination of the future of an evolving psycho-physical
universe. In this orthodox quantum mechanical understanding of the world our
minds matter!
An adequate basic scientiﬁc theory of reality must explain all of the regularities
of human experience. That totality includes not only data pertaining to the motions
of planets and terrestrial objects, and the evidence from atomic physics, but also the
evidence concerning the observed effects in our everyday lives of our conscious
intentional efforts upon our subsequent bodily behavior. These ubiquitous facts of
everyday life exhibit a strong positive correlation between one’s conscious intention
to produce a desired bodily action—such as the raising one’s arm or the moving
one’s ﬁnger—and a follow-up bodily motion of the intended kind. Thus my mental
effort to raise my arm is normally quickly followed, if I focus my intention upon it,
by the rising of my arm. An appreciation of this correlation between subjective
mental intent and subsequent physically described reality is far more important to
the normal living of one’s life than the periodic motions of some tiny pin-points of
light in the night sky. What matters most to us is what we are able to do about our
physical future, and how we are able to do it. In this connection, the
everyday-experience-based belief in the causal power of a person’s mental effort to
inﬂuence the subsequent physically described reality is rationally buttressed by the
fact that contemporary (i.e., quantum) science supports that intuition, rather than
x
Prologue

diminishing us by claiming, as did classical physics, that the experienced causal
effectiveness in the physical world of our mental intentions is “the illusion of
conscious will”.
A personal belief in the power of one’s mental intentions to affect one’s physical
future is the rational foundation of our lives. Our cognizance of this causal effec-
tiveness of our thoughts underlies our rational effortful engagement with the world,
and, consequently, also the structures of our social institutions; of our moral
imperatives; of our legal systems; of our notions of Justice; and of our conscious
efforts to improve the lives of ourselves and those we care about. In a causally
mindless mechanical world of the kind entailed by the materialist precepts of
classical physics this power of our minds is denied, and that denial eliminates any
possibility of a rationally coherent conception of the meaningfulness of one’s life.
For how can your life be meaningful if you are naught but a mechanical puppet
every action of which was completely ﬁxed by a purely mechanical process
pre-determined already at the birth of the universe?
The inclusion of the quantum element of random chance can rescue the mean-
ingfulness of one’s life. For these choices are not written in stone, or ﬁxed by
mechanical determinism. Hence, by being fundamentally indeterminate, or “ran-
dom”, they can be become biased by values, which can thereby inﬂuence the course
of physical events!
The philosophical difﬁculties ensuing from Newton’s presumption about light
and the atomic character of matter are eliminated from orthodox quantum physics
by the replacement of the Newtonian classical dynamics by a quantum dynamics
that elevates our minds from passive bystanders to active participants in the creation
of our psycho-physical future. This radical revision of the role of our minds in the
determination of our future arises directly from the elimination, from the material
world, of all particles of the kind imagined to exist by Isaac Newton, and their
replacement by the quantum idea of “atomic particles”. These latter entities are
mathematically described elements of a new kind that are intrinsically tied to our
conscious experiences. Replacing the purely ﬁctional Newtonian particles by the
experience-related atoms of quantum physics converts the classically conceived
world that has no rational place for causally efﬁcacious conscious experiences into
a quantum world of “potentialities” for certain experiences to occur. It converts a
known-to-be-empirically-false materialist conception of the world into a rationally
coherent quantum conception of reality in which our causally efﬁcacious minds
play an essential role in the determination of our common psycho-physical future.
According to this quantum mechanical understanding of reality, the very same
laws that were originally introduced to account for the empirical ﬁndings in the
domain of atomic physics explain also how a person’s mental intentions can affect
that person’s bodily actions in the way that he or she mentally intends. The advance
from seventeenth-century materialistic science to twenty-ﬁrst-century probabilistic
quantum physics thus converts our minds from slaves of our brains to causal
partners with our brains.
A general recognition of this profound transformation of science’s image of man
from mechanical automaton to “free” (from material coercion) agent constitutes a

contribution of science to today’s troubled world that could in the end be far more
important than its engineering offerings. For how we use our scientiﬁc knowledge
depends on our values, and our values depend on our self-image.
The aim of this book is to convey to general reader’s, in simple but accurate
terms, how realistically interpreted orthodox quantum mechanics works, with
emphasis on the impact of this science-based understanding of ourselves on the
meaningfulness of our lives.

Prologue

Chapter 1
The Origins of the Quantum Conception
of Man
Every culture has its lore about the origins and nature of the world and its people.
Those ideas are often associated with a deity, or deities, and an associated religion.
But there arose in western civilization in the seventeenth century, in connection
with the ideas of Galileo Galilei and Sir Francis Bacon, the notion of a “scientiﬁc”
approach to our understanding of the nature of things. Galileo emphasized the
importance of doing experiments speciﬁcally designed to shed light on particular
questions. Thus in order to gain knowledge about how gravity works he measured
the acceleration of falling objects of varying weights by dropping them from high
places, or by allowing them to roll slowly down inclined planes. Sir Francis Bacon,
on the other hand, emphasized that a detailed understanding of the workings of
nature would allow us to put nature to work for us: to make her a potent ally in our
pursuit of human well being. Thus, whereas our basic beliefs about the nature of
things had generally been based on ancient traditions and sacred writings that
ratiﬁed prayers and acts of worships as the prescribed means of getting nature to
help us, the new “scientiﬁc” idea was to gain an understanding of the regularities of
nature by means of experimental observations, in order to put her thus-discovered
orderliness to work for us.
This seismic shift from religious dogma to empirical evidence was the basis of
the science that followed. Isaac Newton used it to develop what has become known
as classical mechanics, which prevailed as the fundamental scientiﬁc theory about
the nature of things until the beginning of the twentieth century. But at that point it
became clear that nature did not conform to the simple precepts postulated by Isaac
Newton. A new scientiﬁc theory was needed, and was duly created.
Over the course of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, scientists constructed
relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory (RQFT), which is a hugely successful rational
approach that yields validated predictions of high accuracy. The core difference
between the newer theory and the older one is that quantum theory is primarily
about, and is built directly upon, the empirical structure of our conscious experi-
ences, whereas the classical theory was built on a postulated dynamics of material
properties, with the everyday apparent dependence of material properties on our

conscious intentions reduced to an asserted dependence upon material properties
alone. Thus standard quantum mechanics involves, in an essential way, the causal
participation of the minds of us observers, while classical mechanics strictly bans
any such effect of mental realities on the world of matter.
I shall begin this narrative with a brief sketch of the more familiar classical
physical theory, which is still taught in our schools and some of our colleges
without adequate emphasis on its profound differences with its contemporary
quantum successor with respect to the causal role of our minds.
The Classical Predecessor to Contemporary Physics
The science-based approach to understanding nature began in earnest with the work
of Isaac Newton, who said:
… it seems probable to me, that God in the Beginning form’d Matter in solid, massy, hard,
impenetrable, movable Particles”. But the core message of quantum mechanics is that this
“solid particle” conception of matter is a ﬁgment of Newton’s imagination: a pure ﬁction
completely unlike the stuff that constitutes the constituents of the “material world” as it is
understood in orthodox quantum mechanics. In that newer theory the mathematically
described world in which we ﬁnd ourselves embedded has the nature of “a set of poten-
tialities for the occurrence of certain kinds of perceptions”. And these potentialities behave
in many ways more like mental realities than like the solid material particles that Newton
described. Moreover, those Newtonian particles were presumed to interact with one another
primarily by contact. Yet, according to Newton, they also attract each other by the force of
gravity, which acts instantaneously over astronomical distances.
When accused of mysticism because of this assumed instantaneous action at a
distance Newton replied: “That one body can act upon another at a distance through
a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else…is to me so great an absurdity
that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of
thinking can ever fall into it.”
Newton obviously rejected as nonsense the idea of an immaterial instantaneous
action at a distance. Yet he offered no hypothesis about how the information
concerning the location of a source of gravity could be instantaneously conveyed to
a faraway system. He justiﬁed his mysterious assumption by the fact that it led to an
understanding of many known astronomical and terrestrial empirical ﬁndings, such
as the orbits of planets, the rising of tides, and the falling of apples.
Nothing goes Faster Than Light?
More than two centuries later, Albert Einstein proposed an explanation that made
gravity’s inﬂuence non-instantaneous, and, indeed, transmitted at the speed of light.
Einstein’s theory demanded, moreover, that no inﬂuence of any kind could transfer
2

information faster than the speed of light. This condition became a bedrock prin-
ciple of physics that was generally accepted by scientists. But the challenge of
maintaining it in the face of twentieth-century empirical ﬁndings (or dealing ade-
quately with its failure) has become the most basic task of the science of our era.
Our entire scientiﬁc world-view rests upon the completion of this task, which is
entangled with our science-based understanding of our own human nature.
Descartes’ Dualism
These issues concerning the basic nature of things were brought into focus, before
Newton was born, by the writings of the great French philosopher and mathe-
matician René Descartes. He argued that what exists is divided into two different
kinds of things: ‘things that occupy locations in three-dimensional space at instants
of time’, and ‘entities that think’.
This Cartesian duality set the stage for the developments of science that fol-
lowed. It allowed the conceived reality to be divided, actually, into three different
kinds of things: material properties, mental realities, and thinking entities. Material
properties are features of things that are built out of particles and their associated
energy-carrying ﬁelds, and that are ﬁxed by the properties of these component
particles and ﬁelds. Mental realities include your thoughts, ideas, and feelings.
A thinking entity is an entity that is experiencing mental realities.
An example of a possible Cartesian material property is the location of a tiny
Newtonian-type particle whose center is located at each instant of time at a point in
3-D space, with the rest of it lying nearby. Two examples of mental realities are
your feeling of pain when you touch a hot stove, and your experience of the color
“red” when looking at a ripe tomato. An example of a thinking entity is the “You”
that is now experiencing the reading of this book: it thinks your thoughts, knows
your ideas, and feels your feelings. It is the “I” of Descartes’ famous “I think,
therefore I am.”
Descartes recognized that the mental events occurring in a person’s stream of
conscious experiences are associated with the material processes occurring in that
person’s brain. But he maintained that these mental realities are fundamentally
different in kind from the corresponding material activities in the brain. This dif-
ference is the famous, or infamous, Cartesian distinction between mind and body,
or mind and brain.
Classical Determinism
Isaac Newton, building on Descartes’ ideas, focused his attention on the material
aspects. He formulated mathematical “laws of motion” that account in a detailed
way for the motions of the planets in the solar system, for the orbit of the moon

around earth, for rising tides and falling apples, and for a host of other observed
features of the “material” universe. This account makes no mention of any inﬂuence
of mental realities upon material properties, and is called “classical mechanics” or
“classical physics”.
By virtue of these laws, applied universally to all material things, living or dead,
a classical Newtonian-type universe is “deterministic”. This means that the entire
history of that universe is ﬁxed for all time, once the initial conditions and the
mathematical laws of motion are speciﬁed. The aspects of the material universe that
are not ﬁxed by the general laws are thus limited to the selection of the initial
conditions and the choice of the (assumed time-invariant) laws of motion.
Specifying these two inputs then determines every material event that will ever
occur. No matter-based feature is left to chance, or to the will of either Man or
Nature. This early-science-based way of trying to understanding reality in terms of
matter alone, with no essential input from a mental realm, is called “materialism”,
or sometimes “physicalism”.
Philosophical Torment
Philosophers have been tormented for centuries by this seeming verdict of science
that reduces human beings to mechanical automata. Our rational thoughts and
moral sentiments were rendered incapable of deﬂecting, in any way, our bodily
actions from the path ordained at the birth of the universe by the purely
machine-like material aspects of nature. That conception of reality destroys the
rational foundations of moral philosophy: How can you be responsible for your
actions if they were completely determined before you were born, and, indeed, at
the birth of the universe?
This torment is not conﬁned to moral philosophers. The great nineteenth-century
physicist John Tyndall touched upon it when he wrote:
We can trace the development of a nervous system and correlate it with the parallel
phenomena of sensation and thought. We see with undoubting certainty that they go hand
in hand. But we try to soar in a vacuum the moment we seek to comprehend the connection
between them… (The Belfast Address, 1874).
The core difﬁculty here is that mental realities, which certainly do exist, have no
rational place within the framework of 17th/19th century science. They are logically
disconnected appendages that are added on, ad hoc, simply because we know that
they exist. But their effects on what happens in the material world are, according to
classical mechanics, the same as if they do not exist. The reason we seem to be
‘soaring in a vacuum’, as Tyndall bemoans, comes from the materialistic viewpoint
of classical mechanics. That way of thinking, in order to be complete, must permit
the existence of the thoughts we actually experience. Yet it provides absolutely no
4

logical foundation, or even tiny toehold, for any rational understanding of how
human consciousness or feelings can arise from the logical foundation provided by
the materialistic precepts of classical mechanics.
The Copenhagen Shift to a Pragmatic Stance
During the ﬁrst quarter of the twentieth century, a series of experiments were
performed that probed the properties of matter at the level of its atomic constituents.
The results were incompatible not merely with the ﬁne details of classical
mechanics, but with its basic tenets as well.
Responding to this catastrophic breakdown of classical mechanics, scientists
created, during the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, a new theory called “quantum
mechanics”. It is based on concepts profoundly different from those of classical
physics, yet yields extremely accurate predictions about the outcomes of all reliably
replicable experiments, both old and new. It leads also to a revised understanding of
our own human nature that is radically different from the effectively mindless
mechanical conception entailed by the materialistic principles of classical
mechanics.
The original version of quantum mechanics is called “The Copenhagen
Interpretation” because it was hammered out in intense discussions centered at
Niels Bohr’s institute in that city. In order to dodge various philosophical difﬁ-
culties, quantum theory was originally offered not as a “theory of reality”, but rather
as a “pragmatic set of rules”. These rules were designed to allow physicists to make
reliable statistical predictions about what observers will experience in response to
their various contemplated alternative possible probing actions of observation or
measurement.
Virtues of Realism
But the new theory can also be interpreted “realistically”, or “ontologically”, as “an
understanding of reality itself”. A realistic interpretation is, in fact, needed if one
seeks to extract from science any deep insight into the nature of the universe and of
our human selves within it. The thesis expounded in this book is that von
Neumann’s orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics, elucidated where needed
by the ideas of Heisenberg, Dirac, Wheeler, and the mathematician, logician, and
philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, and updated to the relativistic form developed
by Tomonaga and Schwinger, can be regarded as a theory of reality that is sufﬁ-
ciently detailed and accurate to deal with the issues of the general nature of our
mental aspects, and of the causal connection of our conscious minds to the material
world in which our brains and bodies are embedded.

A Condition on the Scope of a Science-Based Theory
of Reality
An adequate scientiﬁc theory of reality ought to accommodate all the regularities of
human experience. This includes not only the results of experiments pertaining to
astronomical, terrestrial, and atomic physics, but also to the experiences of normal
everyday life. These ubiquitous subjective data reveal a strong positive correlation
between a person’s felt mental intention to perform a simple bodily action, such
raising an arm or a ﬁnger, and a subsequent perception of the intended bodily
action!
Empirical data of this kind constitute the rational foundation of our active
meaningful lives, for they effectively instruct us how, by making appropriate mental
efforts, to inﬂuence our bodily actions in mentally intended ways. A theory of
reality that fails to provide a rationally coherent account not only of astronomical,
terrestrial, and atomic data, but of also this directly experienced mind-body rela-
tionship, is fundamentally deﬁcient. Such deﬁcient theories include materialistic
classical mechanics, which claims that everything real is created by the interaction
of matter with itself, but then fails to explain how these purely material processes
generate our conscious perceptions and our causally efﬁcacious mental efforts.
Similarly inadequate is any non-standard materialistic version of quantum theory
that does not account for our subjective experiences, and the capacity of mental
effort to inﬂuence in desired ways the behavior of our bodies!
The standard “orthodox” quantum mechanics can, by virtue of its mathematical
structure, and the words used to describe it, be naturally interpreted realistically,
and when thus-interpreted it brings our mental aspects into the dynamics as ele-
mental realities that are causally linked to matter via speciﬁed “laws of nature”.
I call this interpretation “Realistically Interpreted Orthodox Quantum Mechanics”.
It evades the logically impossible task of explaining how felt mental properties can
be constructed out of mechanical material properties alone, by postulating the
elemental existence of both mind and matter, and then describing in rational
mathematical terms how they interact with each other.
Von Neumann’s “Orthodox” Formulation of Quantum
Mechanics
The “standard” quantum theory, against which all others are compared, is von
Neumann’s “orthodox” formulation of Copenhagen Quantum Mechanics, or, more
speciﬁcally, the updated version, called “Relativistic Quantum Field Theory”,
abbreviated as “RQFT”. It is this relativistic “orthodox” version of quantum theory
that is propounded in this book. As will be presently explained, this theory is about
both: (1), the dynamical interaction of matter with itself that accounts for the
6
1
The Origins of the Quantum Conception of Man

‘unobserved’ behavior of material substances; and (2), the interaction between mind
and matter that constitutes the highly nontrivial ‘process of observation’.
In quantum mechanics the mind-matter interaction is mathematically very dif-
ferent from the matter-matter interaction. And it is different in a mathematical way
that entails that the former can never be reduced to the latter. The difference in these
two dynamical processes is directly connected to Heisenberg’s seminal 1925 dis-
covery, which quickly led to the creation of quantum mechanics. This new theory
gives detailed explanations of the plethora of twentieth century data of atomic
physics that had resisted all attempted explanations via the materialist precepts of
classical physics. Heisenberg’s discovery was that the process of observation—
whereby an observer comes to consciously know the numerical value of a material
property of an observed system—cannot be understood within the framework of
materialist classical mechanics. A non-classical process is needed. This process
does not construct mind out of matter, or reduce mind to matter. Instead, it explains,
in mathematical terms, how a person’s immaterial conscious mind interacts with
that person’s material brain.
An immaterial mind lies beyond the ken of a materialistic approach, and the
mathematics that describes the process of conscious observation is not reducible to
the mathematics that describes the process of the unobserved evolution of matter.
The eminent Hungarian-American mathematician and logician John von
Neumann cast the ideas of Copenhagen quantum mechanics into a rationally
coherent and mathematically rigorous form that is widely used by mathematical
physicists, and also by others who require mathematical and logical precision.
Nobel Laureate Eugene Wigner labeled Von Neumann’s formulation “Orthodox
Quantum Mechanics”. The label “Orthodox” is appropriate, in the sense that many,
and perhaps all, mathematical physicists take it to be the logically and mathemat-
ically precise formulation of the Copenhagen ideas.
Von Neumann approached these mind-related issues by considering what
amounts to a tower of good measuring devices where each device associates,
one-to-one, each input to a corresponding output, and the output of each device is
the input to the device above it. On the top of this tower lies an observer’s con-
scious “ego” that can both receive perceptual inputs and instigate probing actions
by means of its interactions with its associated brain.
About the entry of consciousness into the dynamics, von Neumann says:
First, it is inherently entirely correct the measurement or the related process of subjective
perception is a new entity relative to the physical environment and is not reducible to the
latter. Indeed, subjective perception leads us into the intellectual life of the individual,
which is extra-observational by its very nature [vN p. 418].
This ﬁrst quote emphasizes that, within von Neumann’s “orthodox” represen-
tation of quantum mechanics, the process of subjective perception is not reducible
to the process that governs the interaction of matter with itself. Our subjective
conscious perceptions are, as Descartes had declared, neither equivalent to, nor
reducible to, the behavior of matter. I take this irreducibility of mind to the
Von Neumann’s “Orthodox” Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
7

behavior of matter to be, on the basis of this quote—and everything else said in von
Neumann’s book—a core feature of realistically interpreted “orthodox” quantum
mechanics.
The second quote is:
…it must be possible so to describe the extra-physical process of subjective perception as if
it were in reality in the physical world—i.e., by assigning to its parts equivalent real parts in
the objective word in ordinary space. [vN p. 419].
I take these “equivalent real parts” to be, primarily, the neural (or brain)
correlates of our conscious perceptions.
The third quote is:
Now quantum mechanics describes the events which occur in the observed portion of the
world, so long as they do not interact with the observing portion, with the aid of Process 2,
but as soon as such an interaction occurs, i.e., a measurement, it requires the application of
Process 1. [vN p. 420]
This third quote introduces the two very different processes: Process 1 and
Process 2. Process 2 is the quantum analog of the dynamical process of classical
physics. Like its classical counterpart, Process 2 involves only the material aspects
of nature, and is deterministic. It is also “unitary”, which means, essentially, that its
action merely shufﬂes information around without losing any of it. This Process 2
depends in no way on the mental aspects of nature. But the material/physical state
of the universe, upon which Process 2 acts, contains the neural correlates of our
perceptions that were introduced in the second quote.
Process 1 is the process that generates perceptions. Each Process-1 action is
associated with a particular conscious observer. It has a mathematical form that is
very different from that of Process 2. Process 1 is not “unitary” but is, instead,
“projective”: it is associated with the subjective occurrence of a perception coupled
to the instantaneous elimination from the material universe of all aspects that are
incompatible with the occurrence of that perception. Thus this process has two
phases. The ﬁrst phase selects a possible next subjective perception on the part of
the observer. This ‘possible/potential’ next perception deﬁnes a corresponding brain
correlate, which has, according to the theory, a certain statistical weight. The second
phase of Process 1 then reduces the material universe to two parts, one that deﬁ-
nitely contains this brain correlate and the other that deﬁnitely does not contain this
brain correlate, and it “actualizes” either one part or the other. This choice made by
nature between the two parts accords with a certain statistical rule known as the
“Born Rule”. This Born-Rule choice is the (unique) place where “an element of
chance” enters into the quantum dynamics. The preceding choice of a possible next
perception reﬂects the history and the felt values of the observer, and is identiﬁed
with what the observer feels is his or her personal subjective choice of what
physical property of the observed system to probe or inquire about. No element of
chance is ascribed to this choice made by an observer of a particular possible
probing action.

The Origins of the Quantum Conception of Man

The two phases of Process 1 are manifestations of the differing points of view of
Heisenberg and Dirac, cited by Bohr, in which Heisenberg emphasized the free
choice on the part of the experimenter of which probing experiment to perform,
while Dirac emphasized the choice of the part of nature regarding which outcome
occurs.
The whole process resembles, as emphasized by Wheeler, the game of twenty
questions, in which a succession of Yes/No questions is posed, with each eliciting
‘Yes’ or a ‘No’ response. Von Neumann cast into rigorous mathematical form the
key ideas of the founders, insofar as they strayed from the ofﬁcial “pragmatic” path,
and tried—as scientist rightfully do—to understand what is really going on.
The fact that the generation of a conscious perception involves a dynamical
process that is structurally and mathematical extremely different from the deter-
ministic matter-driven process that governs the unobserved evolution of reality is
the basic difference between materialistic classical mechanics and its quantum
successor. The classical theory presumes that all aspects of nature can be explained
purely in terms of the action of matter upon matter. But the quantum world differs
in a fundamental way from that core precept of materialism. This huge structural
difference in the real (i.e., quantum) world between the matter-matter interaction
and the matter-mind interaction makes manifest the extreme naiveté of trying to
comprehend the connection between mind and matter within a materialistic
framework.
In the quantum world the observing processes of acquiring empirical knowledge
must disturb, or perhaps even bring into existence, the values that we observe. By
virtue of Heisenberg’s discovery, the process of our acquiring knowledge about the
material aspects of nature cannot merely reveal already existing values. The process
of our acquiring knowledge injects our mental aspects in an essential way into the
process that determines “what we will ﬁnd if we look”.
This non-materialistic action injects the mind of the observer as a causal agent
into realistically interpreted orthodox quantum mechanics. It gives our minds an
essential dynamical role to play, and hence a natural and rational reason for them to
exist.
In this game of “twenty questions” the ‘Yes’ answer is the occurrence some
particular perception, say “P”. So the question must, in principle, be whether the
upcoming experience will be “P”? The “question” is thus a (non-verbalize) inquiry
of the form “Will my upcoming perception be “P” “, where “P” is a felt/experienced
representation of a particular possible next perception. This query is instantly fol-
lowed by “nature’s” response, ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. This two-phased process allows our
human conscious choices to enter causally into the evolution of the matter-based
aspects of the world, rather than being helpless witnesses of a ﬂow of events
completely determined by the material aspects of nature alone.
Our probing actions and their observed outcomes are described in terms of
“potential” and “actual” perceptions, respectively. According to the orthodox the-
ory, these perceptions are described in the language (conceptual structure) of
classical physics. In orthodox quantum theory the disparate perceptual and asso-
ciated material properties are causally tied together by the quantum dynamical laws
Von Neumann’s “Orthodox” Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
9

that govern their mutual interaction: mind is dynamically tied to matter, but it is
neither made of matter; nor dynamically pre-determined by matter.
In summary, the orthodox quantum understanding of the evolving world rests
upon a speciﬁed quantum “process of evolution” of a psycho-physical universe.
This process consists of two very different sub-processes. Von Neumann calls them
Process 1 and Process 2. Process 2 is the quantum analog of the classical process of
evolution of material systems. It produces evolution in accordance with the famous
Schrödinger equation. This Process 2, by itself, generates a completely speciﬁed
and pre-determined continuous temporal morphing of the material properties of the
universe into a continuous “quantum smear” of classically describable possibilities
or potentialities. Like its classical counterpart, this process depends in no way on
any mental aspect of nature. This Process-2 matter-generated evolution generates,
however, not just one single world of the kind that we actually perceive, but rather a
‘continuum’ of possible perceivable worlds. Consequently, some other process is
logically required in order to extract from this Process-2 generation of a continuum
of “potentialities”, a choice of what actually happens in the material world, besides
this Process-2 generation of ever-growing sets of perceptual possibilities. This other
process is called “Process 1”. This numbering, which might seem odd, reﬂects the
fact that the very ﬁrst action had to choose and actualize some particular state of
reality, not just shufﬂe around information that was already present.
Our personal conscious thoughts enter the quantum dynamics via these abrupt
Process-1 actions. Our human minds instigate (probing) actions upon the quantum
atomic-particle-based material world that is evolving in accordance with Process 2.
Each such Process-1 intervention is, in line with the ideas of Heisenberg, Dirac,
Wheeler, and Whitehead, resolved by a two-phased action. The ﬁrst phase is a
probing action, which poses a Yes/No query about an observer’s upcoming per-
ceptual experience. The choices of these probing actions are, according to the
precepts of quantum mechanics, not fully determined by the prior material prop-
erties of the atom-based world. They originate in association with the observer’s
mind, which von Neumann calls the observer’s “ego”.
These choices are “free” in the very speciﬁc sense that they are not determined
by the prior quantum mechanical state of the universe. They are therefore called
“free choices”. This injection of an element of freedom (from material coercion)
constitutes a major departure of quantum mechanics from classical mechanics, and
from the general philosophical stance of “materialism”, which demands that the
evolution of matter be fully determined by material properties alone.
The second phase of Process 1 is an immediate ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ response on the
part of what British physicist Paul Dirac, a key founder of quantum mechanics,
called “nature”. A positive ‘Yes’ response adds the perception P, which was
speciﬁed by the observer’s query, to the observer’s stream of conscious perceptual
experiences. It also instantaneously reduces (i.e., collapses) the global quantum
state of the universe to the part of its immediately prior form that is compatible with
that positive response. A negative response leaves the observer’s stream of con-
sciousness unaffected (no perception occurs). But it reduces the global quantum
10
1
The Origins of the Quantum Conception of Man

state of the universe to a form compatible with that negative response. Nature
responds sequentially to the probing yes/no questions posed by the various
observers.
But how is the needed connection established between a person’s mental choices
of probing actions and the intended bodily response?
It can be assumed that the observer’s ego creates, by trial-and-error learning,
beginning in the womb, a mapping of the perceived response to each of various
mentally instigated probing actions. Thus the ego’s knowledge of which effort tends
to lead to which perceptual feedback can be learned: It need not be innate.
[In mathematical terms, the quantum mechanical state of the universe, q, is ﬁrst
reduced by the observer’s probing action to a sum of two terms (P q P), and (P’ q
P’), where this P is a “projection operator” (P times P equals P) and P’ is (1−P).
Nature “actualizes” one or the other term in statistical concordance with the “Born
Rule”, which asserts that the probability that state (P q P) will be actualized is Trace
(P q P) divided by Trace q, where, for any operator or matrix M, Trace M mean the
sum of the diagonal elements of any matrix representation of M.
I have included this parenthetical mathematical remark merely to assure readers
that the “ordinary words” that I have been using are not mere verbal ﬂuff. They
have deﬁnite mathematical meanings, which lead to predictions that are accurate, in
one highly non-trivial case, to the width of a human hair, compared to the distance
to the moon, and that encompass in general a vast realm of pertinent empirical
phenomena. Quantum theory thus warrants serious consideration by any reader
truly interested in the basic nature of things. Any adequate proposed alternative to
the orthodox interpretation needs to produce a theory of the mind-brain connection
that is as good, or better, than the orthodox theory described here. For our expe-
riences are the only things we know, and hence their empirical structure needs to be
explained by any basic physical theory that can be deemed satisfactory.]
The Action of Mind on Matter
The entry of the abrupt Process-1 actions into the continuous Process-2 evolution
entails that the mind of an observer is no longer a helpless witness to a mechanically
predetermined course of material events. The Process-1 actions convert the
observer’s ego into an actor on the world stage. Each probing action, initiated by an
ego, inﬂuences—by means of nature’s response to that action—the macroscopic
behavior of the atomic-particle-based material universe. Thus our minds become
endowed, by means of the quantum mechanical dynamical rules, with the power to
inﬂuence the macroscopic properties of matter, without themselves being totally
predetermined by material properties alone!
This empowerment of our psychological aspects is a fundamental feature of
standard quantum mechanics. This change in the basic ontological structure
Von Neumann’s “Orthodox” Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
11

eliminates, by means of an advance in science, the absurdity of a consciousness that
can do nothing but delude us into believing an outright lie—that our minds are
causally inert—which, if believed, would surely be detrimental to the ambitions of
anyone who accepts as veridical the ﬁndings of science. For an acceptance of the
belief in the total physical impotence of one’s conscious efforts would seriously
undermine the mental resolve needed to overcome the obstacles that often stand in
the way of our efforts to create what we judge to be a better world.
The empowering message of quantum mechanics is that the empirical data of
everyday life, and also our intuitions, are generally veridical, not delusional; and
hence that our mental resolves can often help bring causally to pass the bodily
actions that we mentally intend. The role of our minds is to help us, not to deceive
us, as the materialist philosophy must effectively maintain.
Appearances are Deceiving: Classical Appearances Versus
Quantum Realities
According to the quantum rules, described above, each true perception is an
experience of certain macroscopic features of a material (i.e., atomic-particle-based)
universe. But a basic precept of quantum mechanics asserts that our perceptions are
described in the language of classical physics. This means that, according to
quantum theory, each perception P is described in terms of macroscopic properties
of systems built basically out of the “solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable
particles” of Isaac Newton. That world of perceivable macroscopic properties can
be called the world of “appearances”. On the other hand, quantum mechanics also
describes the macroscopic properties of macroscopic systems built out of the atomic
particles of atomic physics. From the point of view of realistically interpreted
orthodox quantum mechanics, the underlying physically described reality is the
quantum state (the so-called density matrix) of the universe, and it is built out of
quantum mechanically represented atomic particles, and their associated physical
ﬁelds, whereas the appearances (perceptions) are built out of Newtonian particles.
But this means that in quantum mechanics both the ‘physical reality’ and the
‘appearances’ are represented mathematically. This ‘mathematical duality’ provides
the foundation for a greater role of mathematical and logical rigor than was possible
in the classical-physics-based materialistic approach. There the underlying ‘physi-
cal reality’ is deemed to be built out of the ﬁctitious Newtonian particles (instead of
the contemporary-science-based atomic particles), and the appearances are descri-
bed in psychological terms. Hence the quantum mechanical approach to the
mind-brain problem is structurally and mathematically very different from the
classical/materialistic approach, and—because both our perceptions and the
underlying material causal structure are described mathematically—it provides for
greater mathematical and logical rigor than classical physics allows.
12

The Origins of the Quantum Conception of Man

These two physical theories, classical and quantal, are contradictory. Yet
orthodox quantum mechanics combines them to produce a rationally coherent
understanding of the connection between mind and brain. This quantum approach
constitutes a way of comprehending that connection that is far more reasonable than
what is attainable within the materialistic framework, which is fatally ﬂawed by the
omission of our causal minds from the theory of the mind-brain connection: “It’s
like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.”
The oft-heard claim that “quantum mechanics is not relevant to the mind-brain
problem because quantum theory is only about tiny things”, is absolutely contrary
to the basic quantum principles. Being ‘big’ does not tend to make a quantum
system truly classical! Quantum mechanics is explicitly designed to cover ‘big’
systems, but by becoming ‘big’ a quantum system does not become classical!
Indeed, the fact that quantum mechanics is explicitly designed to cover big
things is important to the solution of the mind-brain problem. For the quantum
mechanical dynamics leads to the evolution of the brain, via Process 2, into a
mixture of many different brain states that correspond to many different potential
experiences, and hence to the need for the added Process 1 that selects for con-
sideration some perceivable small part of the existing mixture, which nature will
then promptly either actualize or reject.
This proliferation in the brain of representations of many different alternative
possible immediate courses of action is assured by the structure of ion channels. Ion
channels are large brain molecules, each having a small tube (a channel) through
which ions of a particular kind—say calcium ions—can ﬂow single ﬁle, under
speciﬁc brain conditions, into the interior of a neuron, where they tend to cause that
neuron to release, in due course, a “vesicle” of a neuro-transmitter molecules into
the gap that separates that neuron from a neighboring neuron. The narrowness of
the ion tube ensures that the ion that enters the interior of the neuron has a large
uncertainty in its direction of motion. Hence each ion channel in the brain is a
source of dynamical uncertainly in the Process-2-generated evolution of the
quantum state of the brain. The resulting macroscopic state of the brain will thus
tend to evolve into a quantum “mixture” of many different classically describable
brain states, each with a different perceptual correlate, between which the
mind-dependent quantum Process 1 is free to choose. Thus the pertinent-for-us
essence of quantum mechanics is the causal dynamical linkage that QM speciﬁes
between our conscious thoughts and our atomic-particle-based brains.
The quantum mechanically entailed causal effects of our mental intentions upon
our material brains is in complete harmony with our normal intuition, which is
based on our lifetimes of ﬁrst-hand empirical evidence. Our minds are promoted by
quantum dynamics from the absurd role of impotent witnesses of events they cannot
affect to causally effective instigators of intended bodily actions. Our minds thus
have a natural reason to exist, which is to help us to achieve what we value, not to
deceive us into believing we are something we are not!
Appearances are Deceiving: Classical Appearances Versus Quantum Realities
13

The conclusion here, and in what follows, is that the realistically interpreted
orthodox quantum conception of reality provides not only dynamical explanations
of all well-established ordinary empirical data, but, automatically, also the foun-
dation of a rationally coherent dynamical understanding of how our conscious
minds can affect our material brains, and hence our material bodies, in ways con-
cordant with both our conscious intentions and the empirical data of everyday life.
Those ubiquitous ﬁrst-hand data, which seem to conﬁrm the causal power of our
mental intentions, need not be interpreted as “illusions’’ or “delusions”, as the
Newtonian-particle-based materialistic physics appears to demand. Likewise, the
problem of the seeming incompatibility of “free will” and “determinism” is
resolved by noting that the QM law of evolution incorporates the inputs from our
“free” (not-materially-coerced) choices into the causal dynamics! Hence there is
natural causal evolution, and thus no causal gap or incompatibility that needs to be
explained.
The reader might be encouraged to take von Neumann’s formulation of quantum
mechanics seriously by considering the words of the distinguished Nobel Laureate
Hans Bethe, who said “I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von
Neumann’s does not indicate a species superior to that of man.” Another expression
of the same idea was a (joking) suggestion that von Neumann was actually an
outer-space alien who had trained himself to perfectly imitate a human being in
every way.
Potentia
The central theme of the realistically interpreted orthodox quantum mechanics
(RIOQM) being expounded in this book is that the quantum state (i.e. density
matrix) of the universe is not merely a useful pragmatic tool, as proposed in the
‘epistic’ Copenhagen conception of quantum mechanics, but is also a representation
of essential aspects of reality itself.
A basic question is then “What is the ontological character of this aspect of
reality?” The answer, in concordance with the ideas of Heisenberg and others, is
that it has the character of set of “Aristotelian Potentialities”. That is, it is a col-
lection of potentialities, or tendencies, or proclivities, or dispositions, or probabil-
ities for each one of a collection of alternative possible actual mental events to
occur, each in conjunction with new updated set of potentialities. This transfor-
mation must be actualized by a process. In RIOQM one such process consists of a
two-phased Process-1 probing action of the kind described in orthodox von
Neumann quantum mechanics. There might conceivably be other actualization
processes in the fullness of nature, but they are neither speciﬁed nor taken into
consideration in this theory, which is focused on the details of the connection
between our causally efﬁcacious conscious minds and our quantum mechanically
described brains.

Summary
This ﬁrst chapter has provided a quick overview of Realistically Interpreted
Orthodox Quantum Mechanics. The next nine chapters weave into the narrative
more details of the various key features of the orthodox causal connection of our
minds to our brains. Chapter 11 goes a step further, ontologically, by arguing that
the detailed behavioral properties of the various parts of the orthodox structure
suggest that the mental and material aspects of reality are lodged in an overarching
nonlocal reality that is fundamentally mind-like in character: the mental and
material aspects of the quantum dualism tend to merge, upon detailed analysis, into
an underlying mental monism that includes mathematically described properties
conceived to be embedded in a 4D space-time continuum. In the end it is indeed
true that “all is one”, and that that “unity” encompasses both our mental and
material aspects.
That idea, that the underlying reality is fundamentally mind-like, has been
advanced often before, on the basis of all sorts of reasons. But that conclusion is
often thought to involve going beyond science, and, indeed, going against science.
Here that conclusion arises from science-based considerations alone.

Chapter 2
Waves, Particles, and Minds
Particles and Waves
Classical mechanics developed during the nineteenth century—due principally to
the work of James Clerk Maxwell—into a form that involved two different kinds of
physical stuff: “particles” and “waves”. Electrons are the prime example of parti-
cles, whereas “light”, in the form of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, is the prime example
of a wave. Particles are tiny, highly-localized structures, each with a center that, at
each instant of time, is situated at one precise point in three-dimensional space, with
the rest of the particle lying nearby. A wave, on the other hand, tends to spread out
over a large region in space, and to exhibit “interference patterns” due to the
cancellations or reinforcements of moving crests and troughs.
Particles and waves have, therefore, contradictory structures: particles always
stay tiny, whereas waves tend to spread out. Thus Planck’s discovery in 1900 that
light, which had seemed to be a wave, had a corpuscular nature came as quite a
shock. Light of a given frequency appeared to be emitted in chunks, each carrying a
quantity of energy that is directly proportional to the frequency of the light wave,
with a universal proportionality factor called Planck’s constant. Albert Einstein won
the Nobel Prize for his explanation, ﬁve years later, of the photo-electric effect.
Empirically, a metallic surface radiated by light of a deﬁnite frequency emits
electrons with energies equal—after a correction for the energy needed to get the
electron out of the metal—to the energy of the incoming quantum of light, now
understood to be localized like a particle.
The concepts of classical physics were unable to cope either with this
wave-particle-duality problem, or with a large number of other problems con-
cerning the properties of atoms. A new way of understanding nature was needed,
and was created.

Science and Philosophy
These problems of wave-particle duality and atomic structure appear to be com-
pletely physical in character. But the founders of quantum mechanics were men of
profound philosophical bent. Niels Bohr’s father was an eminent physiologist
familiar with the writings of William James, and Wolfgang Pauli was the godson of
the philosopher Ernst Mach. Werner Heisenberg, whose father was also a professor,
was greatly inﬂuenced by the views of Bohr and Pauli. All three were strongly
inﬂuenced by the view of Albert Einstein that science rests in the end on empirical
ﬁndings, and that our physical theories are basically human inventions that help us
deal with the world known to us only via our conscious observations and experi-
ences. Bohr, concurring, announced at the start of his 1934 book, Atomic Theory
and the Description of Nature, that “In physics…our problem consists in the
coordination of our experiences of the external world.” A few pages later (p. 18) he
writes:
In our description of nature the purpose is not to disclose the real essence of phenomena,
but only to track down as far as possible relations between the multifold aspects of our
experience.
In line with this viewpoint, the founders of quantum theory ofﬁcially presented
their theory not as what would normally be called a description of an existing and
evolving material reality, as was done in classical mechanics. Their theory was
offered, rather, as a tool that scientists have invented for making testable and useful
predictions about future experiences on the basis of knowledge gleaned from prior
experiences.
That ofﬁcial position was a secure one from which Bohr could defend the theory
against Einstein’s objections. It was useful also for keeping students on a pro-
ductive track of learning how to use the theory in practical applications, and pre-
venting them from spending (wasting?) their time pondering philosophical issues
about which even the founders did not fully agree. Heisenberg and Pauli both
devoted much time and effort trying to understand the nature of the reality lying
behind the pragmatic rules. And von Neumann speaks in his discussion of the
measuring process about the connection of the “intellectual inner life of the indi-
vidual” to the circumstances “which actually exist in nature.” He seems very clearly
to be talking about an underlying reality, not merely a pragmatic tool.
The fate of classical mechanics provides a stark warning of the danger of taking
initial success as tantamount to victory in the search for truth. Accordingly, the
impressive empirical successes of standard (Copenhagen-Orthodox) quantum
mechanics have failed to convince all physicists of the real need to bring into the
dynamical laws any experiential quality that is not fully speciﬁed by the material
and space-time structure of the universe. Alternatives to standard quantum
mechanics have thus been proposed that are essentially in line with the precepts of
18

Waves, Particles, and Minds

materialism, which exclude from the dynamics all immaterial elements. But the
theme of this book is that von Neumann’s (orthodox) formulation of quantum
mechanics, as elucidated herein, has, by virtue of the rational coherence of its
mathematical, empirical, and philosophical components, the qualiﬁcations that
warrant its being regarded as an adequate putative theory of reality itself. A “sine
qua non” of an ‘adequate’ theory of reality is that it provide a rationally coherent
understanding of the relationship between our conscious experiences and the
associated processes occurring in our brains.
The Realistically Interpreted Orthodox Quantum Mechanics described here
violates the demand of materialism that our conscious experiences have no causal
power beyond what can be explained by the causal properties of matter alone—
where ‘matter’ consists of things described in geometrical terms, and built out of
geometrical structures like Newtonian particles and their associated energy-carrying
ﬁelds.
This quantum mechanical world is basically a psycho-physical structure in which
the causal effects of the disparate mental and atomic-particle-based elements are
woven together by means of von Neumann’s carefully formulated quantum
dynamical laws. Those laws entail that a person’s material actions can be inﬂuenced
in speciﬁed ways by his or her mental aspects in ways that are not ﬁxed by the
evolving material aspects of the universe alone. This understanding of standard
(Copenhagen-Von Neumann) quantum mechanics is thus fundamentally non-ma-
terialistic: our mental aspects enter into the evolution of matter in ways not
reducible to effects of matter alone. It is an understanding that is based on the
words and concepts of the founders—particularly Heisenberg’s and Bohr’s ref-
erence to the “free choices” of probing actions on the part of experimenter-ob-
servers, and Dirac’s choice of response on the part of “nature”, all rigorously
expressed in the mathematics and words of John von Neumann.
This insertion of fundamentally mental causes into our basic physical theory
generates a gross violation of what had, for two hundred years, been widely
regarded as a key feature of a ‘scientiﬁc’ theory of reality; a feature considered to
identify a proposed theory as science, as opposed to non-science. Indeed, the
materialist demand of strict exclusion from the material world of all effects of
mental causes is still regarded as a scientiﬁc imperative by many researchers, who
consequently endeavor to explain the seemingly mind-related behavior of a per-
son’s body, whilst stoutly denying the possibility of any actual causal effect of that
person’s mind upon his or her bodily behavior.
But how did this radical break with materialism ever come about? How and why
did the band of highly reputable physicists that created quantum mechanics sud-
denly, in 1925, feel entitled to make this huge break with the then-highly-honored
classical materialistic tradition? The answer is to be found in:
Science and Philosophy

Heisenberg’s Seminal 1925 Discovery
The common idea of quantum mechanics in the minds of many non-physicists
centers on Bohr’s renowned model of the atom. According to that model, atoms are
like miniature classical solar systems in which the circling electrons tend to stay on
favored orbits, but make occasional “jumps” from one such orbit to another, with an
associated emission or absorption of a photon. That model is an essentially classical
physical system, with some added “quantum” conditions that there exist these
favored orbits whose locations are related to the mysterious quantum constant
discovered in 1900 by Max Planck.
Bohr’s model dates from 1913, and hence was twelve years shy of the 1925
creation of quantum mechanics. While that 1913 model certainly does bring an
important quantum element into the dynamics, it is seriously deﬁcient as a char-
acterization of the essential difference between classical mechanics and its quantum
successor. It is ironic that this Bohr model of orbiting electrons is often offered as an
example of the quantum nature of things, when, actually, the creation of quantum
mechanics, triggered by Heisenberg’s 1925 work, was precisely a rejection of the
ideas of the 1913 quasi-classical Bohr model, with its deﬁnite trajectories of
orbiting electrons, and lack of all reference to “our knowledge”.
The
key
differences
between
standard
Copenhagen/Orthodox
quantum
mechanics and its classical predecessor are, ﬁrst, that the classical notion of par-
ticles as tiny objects moving on trajectories is replaced by the quantum notion of
atomic particles represented by waves; second, that in the new theory these particles
do not have well-deﬁned trajectories; and third, that the needed abrupt collapses of
the quantum states of systems are instigated by mental aspects of nature, not by
purely mechanical/material aspect of nature acting alone. Thus our conscious
experiences are, according to the new orthodox view, not causally inert bystanders,
as in classical mechanics, but play an essential causal role in the determination of
the objective psycho-physical future. These differences underscore the radically
new ideas that emerged from Heisenberg’s 1925 discovery, and that are
mathematically

in

construed
standard
(Copenhagen/
Orthodox/RQFT) quantum mechanics.
The principle of the “causal closure of physical” is, as mentioned earlier,
sometimes regarded as part of a deﬁnition of science: a discriminating property that
sets science apart from non-science. But science is perhaps better characterized,
following the leads of Galileo and Bacon, by our essential use of probing actions
intended to test hypotheses, and thereby allow us acquire knowledge about the
material world; coupled with our practical applications of the knowledge that we
thereby acquire.
Bohr’s 1913 model does not bring into the dynamics any clear indication of a
failure of the core precepts of materialistic classical physics. It merely adds some
quantum conditions. And that model seemed to be putting physics onto a promising
track. But then how and why did this radical triad of ideas (the representation of an
atomic particle by a wave; the omission of particle trajectories; and the essential
20
2
Waves, Particles, and Minds

incorporation into the dynamics of the non-materialistic process of our acquiring
knowledge) suddenly become accepted in 1925 by the founders of quantum
mechanics as core precepts of their new physical theory? How did those completely
alien and subversive ideas gain traction in a scientiﬁc environment so intrinsically
hostile to it?
This abrupt 1925 turnabout was instigated by the persisting failures of the
semi-classical attempts to account for the accumulating data of atomic physics,
coupled with a profound discovery made in 1925 by Werner Heisenberg. He had
come to believe that something was profoundly wrong with the (essentially clas-
sical) ideas of the 1913 Bohr model, and that the needed new theory should be built
on properties that are actually known to exist—by virtue of our capacity to become
cognizant of their numerical values by performing appropriate measuring proce-
dures. These considerations directed Heisenberg’s attention to the empirical pro-
cesses of acquiring knowledge. While studying, theoretically, the processes of
measuring, respectively, the ‘location’ and the ‘momentum’ of an atomic particle,
say an electron, Heisenberg found that if the ‘location’ was measured ﬁrst, and the
‘momentum’ second, then the product of the two outcomes differs from the product
obtained when the two properties are measured in the reverse order. And the
difference between these two products is essentially the famous constant that Planck
discovered in 1900. Consequently, this completely unexpected connection between
the outcomes of the two observation procedures must be connected to the quantum
character of reality. And it entails that the process of acquiring knowledge about
material properties cannot generally leave those properties undisturbed! For, if the
process of acquiring knowledge allowed the observer simply to become aware of
ﬁxed pre-existing values then the two products of the outcomes could not remain
differing by the ﬁxed Planck’s constant in the limit in which the times of the two
measurements tend to become equal. Heisenberg discovered that our actions of
acquiring knowledge must disturb the observed system in detailed ways that are
intricately tied to Planck’s constant!
That discovery quickly led Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan to a radically new
theory based on the idea that, in keeping with certain prevailing philosophical ideas,
the core subject matter of a satisfactory theory of the nature of things should be ‘the
evolving structure of our empirical knowledge of the world’—not ‘the evolving
structure of an imagined material world built primarily upon Newton’s “solid,
massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable particles’. Those particles can reasonably be
viewed as pure ﬁctions that happen to be useful in certain macroscopic contexts, but
that fail to work in situations involving our acquiring of knowledge about the
structure and behavior of atomic particles, particularly those contained in the
neural/brain correlates of our perceptions.
The notion that the material world is built (principally) out of these Newtonian
particles is, from the standard view of QM, a useful ﬁctional creation of Isaac
Newton. There exists no empirical evidence for their actual existence. Accordingly,
the core subject matter of the new theory is taken to be something we do know,
namely the structure of our evolving knowledge of the material world. This
knowledge is asserted to be generated by the speciﬁed “objective mind-brain
Heisenberg’s Seminal 1925 Discovery
21

process of acquiring subjective knowledge”. This process of observation is,
according to the new theory, instigated in part—just as we innately feel it is—by the
observer’s mental intent and conscious effort, which thereby causally affect the
observed material world. Orthodox QM spells out in great—although not com-
plete–detail of how this mind-brain connection works.
Using measuring devices to acquire knowledge about matter dates from antiq-
uity. And telescopes and microscopes were important in the development of clas-
sical mechanics. But in quantum mechanics Heisenberg’s discovery entails that, in
principle, these two processes of measurement—of ‘location’ and ‘momentum’—
cannot individually always leave the measured system just as it was, and with
deﬁnite values of these two properties. For, if they did, then the product of the
outcomes of these two knowledge-acquiring operations would have to be inde-
pendent of the temporal ordering of these two procedures, in the limit in which they
became simultaneous.
Thus Heisenberg’s 1925 discovery entails that the increases in our knowledge of
the properties of matter, which we acquire by performing measurements, cannot in
general leave the state of the measured matter unchanged, and with deﬁnite values
of these two properties. The probing processes that allow us to gain knowledge
about properties of matter must ‘in principle’ sometimes ‘disturb’ those properties
by ﬁnite (non-zero) amounts speciﬁed by Planck’s constant. But in classical
mechanics this difference can in principle be smaller than what quantum reality
demands! Thus, in order to accommodate Heisenberg’s ﬁnding, about the
mind-brain connection we must, as a matter of principle, abandon classical
mechanics, and, more generally, the philosophy of materialism!
The problem facing the founders was not merely to acknowledge the failure of
the simple idea that we trivially acquire knowledge of the material world by simply
mentally grasping directly the material facts, as was effectively assumed in classical
mechanics. It is obvious that the fact that we can learn about the motions of the tiny
pinpoints of light that correspond to planets, without appreciably affecting their
motions, does not automatically carry over to the motions of the points that cor-
respond to the locations of the electrons or atoms in our brains. The needed
quantum theory had to account for the fact that the process of acquiring knowledge
about the properties of the material world had to disturb the material structure in
precisely the quantitative way needed to account for Heisenberg’s ﬁndings! Thus a
major revision in our understanding of the mind-matter connection lies at the heart
of quantum mechanics.
To expect, under these conditions, to understand the mind-brain connection
within the materialistic classical framework is truly an “Astonishing Hypothesis”—
as was recognized by Francis Crick, who nevertheless espoused it, and called for a
classical-physics-based neuroscience. That recommendation has dominated subse-
quent neuroscience, and produced a plethora of data, but, unsurprisingly, no
understanding of how our mental consciousness is connected to our material brains.
This book is about the non-astonishing orthodox QM claim that the mind-matter
connection is a quantum effect.

Waves, Particles, and Minds

In the light of Heisenberg’s discovery, the founders of quantum mechanics were
emboldened to let go of classical mechanics, which effectively sets Plank’s constant
to zero, in conﬂict with nature, and, instead, build a rationally coherent alternative
to classical mechanics that incorporates into its foundational structure Heisenberg’s
discovery pertaining to the general non-trivial effects of the process of acquiring
subjective knowledge about the objective state of the material world, and that
moreover permits precise predictions about the observed structure of human
knowledge. Within this quantum framework a person’s acquired knowledge of
material properties is not a faithful representation of the pre-probing properties of
the observed system, but is, instead, an output of a dynamical probing processes
initiated by the observing person. The observer’s un-coerced-by-matter choices of
what to observe affect the temporal evolution of the material aspects of nature.
One therefore cannot exclude the effects of the processes of our acquiring
knowledge from of an adequate basic physical theory. That effect is both limiting
and liberating: it limits, via the uncertainty principle, what we can know, but
expands, via the entailed power of our minds, the possibilities for what we can do!
The orthodox quantum framework is, therefore, not just an arbitrary construct
conjured up out of thin air by the founders, and justiﬁed merely by its eventual
success in accounting for the behavior of matter. The driving endeavor of the
founders was to create a rationally coherent conceptual structure that accommodates
and explains—and is able to make useful predictions about—the structure of our
conscious experiences. Our experiences thereby become the basic veridical realities
of the theory, not misleading delusions.
Heisenberg’s 1925 discovery was that the process of acquiring knowledge about
the material world is very nontrivial! It is not a mere grasping of preexisting
realities, but a highly structured action upon those realities. That unexpected result
elevates the science-based conception of ourselves from passive observers to active
agents. That reversal is the underlying core message of quantum mechanics! In the
oft-cited words of Niels Bohr: “In the drama of existence we are ourselves both
actors and spectators.”
Standard
quantum
theory
is
thus
a
psycho-physical
(or
perhaps
an
episto-material) theory of the interaction of the evolving material aspects of nature
with our evolving knowledge of those aspects. The theory, with its detailed
agreements with observed (hence macroscopic) data, emerged, basically, from
Heisenberg’s guiding principle, which restricts what the theory ‘postulates to exist”
to properties of a kind that we can, via our observations, ‘know exist’. His principle
was to build on an empirically secure foundation, instead of empirically unsup-
ported guesses.
The close agreement of the resulting theory with the normal objective empirical
data is certainly a bottom-line success. But standard quantum theory describes, via
Process 1, also the dynamical connection between a person’s mentally instigated
actions and that person’s consequent mental perceptions of material responses to
those actions, Any putative alternative “non-standard quantum theory” that fails to
provide a rational theory of these more subjective aspects of the mind/brain con-
nection is fundamentally deﬁcient, compared to the standard quantum mechanics.
Heisenberg’s Seminal 1925 Discovery
23

It was the assumed possibility for an ideal observer to know in principle,
simultaneously, both the ‘location’ and the ‘momentum’ of every particle in the
universe (and eventually the analogous properties of the ﬁelds) that allowed
Laplace to deduce from the materialist principles of classical mechanics the “de-
terminism” of the material world, and hence, within the framework of classical
mechanics, the impossibility of a causal intervention of anything not fully char-
acterized by its material properties. But that whole notion of the “causal closure of
the physical” fails in a world where the mind-dependent quantum dynamical rules
prevail.
We do not directly perceive atomic particles. We perceive only ‘big’ (macro-
scopic) systems that are built out of combinations of large numbers of atomic
particles (and their associated physical ﬁelds). Quantum mechanics has well-deﬁned
rules for combining many atomic particles together to make big objects and sys-
tems, and to represent in mathematical language the purely mechanical (Process-2)
aspect of the evolution of those macroscopic systems.
A ‘big’ physical object, although perceived in classically describable terms, is
not causally governed by the laws of classical physics. It must be treated as a
conglomeration of its atomic (quantum) constituents in order to account for its
physical properties such as rigidity and electrical conductivity. Yet if it is treated as
a conglomeration of its atomic quantum mechanical constituents evolving in
accordance with Process 2 alone, then it will not have in general, and most
speciﬁcally when it is a measuring device, a classically describable location and
shape. Process 2 generates a quantum state (i.e., density matrix) that represents a
sum (called a “mixture”) of a ‘continuum’ of potential/possible worlds of the type
that we can actuality perceive or experience, but does not specify which element (or
set of elements) in this continuum will be “actualized” if someone looks.
This “mixture” of potentialities is sometimes called a “smear” of potentialities.
Thus the quantum mechanical state of the macroscopic “pointer” on a measuring
device is, by virtue of the process-2 evolution, “smeared out” over a continuous
collection of potential locations along the dial. But that whole smear is not what is
perceived if someone looks. It is the mind-dependent Process 1, not the
mind-independent Process 2, that resolves the question of what our actual experi-
ences are.
Process-2 evolution includes the interaction of the system of interest with the
surrounding environment, but that “environmental decoherence” effect falls far
short of specifying what an observer will experience/perceive if he looks! It is
Process 1, not mere environmental decoherence, that provides that needed result.
As already described in Chap. 1, this Process 1 ﬁrst selects, from the
Process-2-generated continuum of potentialities, a particular perception that ‘might’
occur. Then ‘nature’ chooses, subject to the statistical Born Rule, either to accept
the possibility selected by the observer, and then actualize the global consequences
of that acceptance, or actualize the global consequences of rejecting the observer’s
proposal.
[The above description decomposes the standard vN description of an event that
can involve, all at once, a large set of possibilities, into an ordered sequence of
24
2
Waves, Particles, and Minds

possibilities, each involving a single Yes/No question, as in the game of twenty
questions. Thus the whole large set questions can be considered to be posed,
one-by-one, with no passage of physical time, until a ‘Yes’ response eventually
appears. This easily graspable formulation, proposed by Wheeler, is equivalent to
the standard one, and more easily converted to the relativistic version demanded by
RQFT. That latter version of the theory requires that a particular 3D “global instant
now” be deﬁned in association with each of nature’s Yes-or-No responses, and that
the associated global collapse be instituted along that 3D surface, which divides 4D
space-time into an associated “past” and an associated “future”. This will be dis-
cussed later.]
By means of the two processes, Process 1 and 2, the standard (Copenhagen-Von
Neumann) approach elevates our inner mental selves, our egos, from passive
spectators to active agents. From this orthodox quantum mechanical perspective,
the basic difﬁculty with putative materialistic versions of quantum mechanics that
leave our human mental choices out of the dynamics, is that they leave the theory
burdened with (1): our useless conscious processes; and (2), a quantum mechani-
cally evolving world with no means for selecting, from the Process-2-generated
quantum smears of possibilities, what our actual perceptions will be. Moreover, the
denial of the causal potency of our mental efforts is blatantly contradicted,
empirically, by the ubiquitous experiences of everyday life. The materialists’ claim
that this experiential basis of our lives is an “illusion” rings hollow when the theory
that makes this claim is found to be false, and is replaced by a hugely successful
theory in which the ubiquitous daily experiences of the causal power of our mental
intentions in the world of matter is rationally explained.
The Standard Copenhagen-Von Neumann Approach
The aforementioned ‘smearing’ difﬁculty is resolved in the standard quantum
approach by bringing into the dynamics something beyond the Schrödinger equa-
tion, namely the probing actions of observing agents. The probing query might be,
“Will my upcoming experience be that of the pointer on the measuring device lying
between 5 and 5.01 on the dial?” A ‘Yes’ response on the part of nature consists of
nature’s delivering to the observer the query-deﬁned possible experience, and
reducing the quantum state of the entire universe to the part of its prior self com-
patible with that ‘Yes’ response. A ‘No’ answer will result in a corresponding
reduction, but no immediate experiential feedback. This omission leaves room for
another query to be posed with no passage of physical time. Thus millions of ‘No’s’
can be produced by Nature with (little or) no passage of measured physical time.
The primary reality assumption in the realistically interpreted orthodox quantum
ﬁeld theory that I am describing is that the evolving quantum state (i.e., density
matrix) of the universe is an element of reality. The behavior of this quantum state
is concordant with the idea that it represents, as Heisenberg and the philosopher

North
Whitehead
have
emphasized,
a
collection
of

“potentialities for future experiences”. This quantum potentiality normally evolves
according to the deﬁnite Process 2, but, in order to become an ‘actuality’, a ‘po-
tentiality’ must be ‘actualized’ by some other process, and the future is thus con-
sidered to be “open”. In contrast, a future ‘classical possibility’ is mechanically
predetermined to ‘happen’ or ‘not happen’ already at the birth of the universe,
thereby precluding any possibility that our mental intentions and efforts can make
any difference in what happens to our physical bodies.
In von Neumann’s formulation, the purely atomic-physics-based dynamical
process (Process 2) does not fail because a system is ‘big’. It fails because the
atom-based aspects of the dynamics are only part of the causal story. The causal,
deterministic unitary Process 2 is disrupted by non-unitary Process-1 perceptual
observations, which therefore have causal effects upon the physical/material world
that are not caused by the purely matter-based Process 2. Thus materialism fails!
That is, the purely matter-based Process-2 evolution fails when that evolution
comes into causal contact with the material correlates of our subjective experiences,
which are the neural (or brain) correlates of our subjective experiences of probing
and perceiving. No other failure of Process 2 is mentioned!
Von Neumann spends a lot of time and effort reducing the quantum mathematics
to properties of so-called projection operators. These can be directly related to
experiments that have just two alternative possible results, Yes or No, which can be
associated with whether or not an observer perceives a speciﬁed response or fails to
perceive such a response to his probing action. This association allows well-deﬁned
connections to be formed between von Neumann’s mathematics and observer
perceptions. If the answer is ‘Yes’ then the speciﬁed perception occurs. If the
answer is ‘No’ then no perception occurs, for no perception can be all the per-
ceptions other than the speciﬁed one.
This rule allows many immediate ‘No’ responses to be delivered by nature
before the one ‘Yes’ in a multiple-choice question.
The purely mechanical atom-based Process-2 evolution fails when a measuring
process is performed, due to the over-riding character of the Process-1 action.
Orthodox quantum mechanics is thus basically a description of this causal
dynamical interaction between our conscious minds, which carry our perceptions,
and our material atom-based brains, which contain the brain correlates of our
probing actions and the responding perceptions.
The earlier classical mechanics is constitutionally unable to accommodate the
twentieth-century empirical data. But the most elemental and ubiquitous source of
empirical data is one’s own daily experiencing of the ability of one’s mental effort
to inﬂuence one’s bodily action. Who has not witnessed the intense struggle of the
newborn infant to learn, by trial and error, which mental effort produces which
perceived bodily response? To classify this ﬁrst-hand empirical data as an “illusion”
in order to salvage a theory that is known to be fundamentally false, and false in a
way that is essentially an incorrect understanding of the connection between our
conscious experiences and their brain counterparts, is neither rational nor scientiﬁc.
The quantum resuscitation of the causal power of our thoughts overturns the
absurd classical notion that nature has endowed us with conscious minds whose
26
2
Waves, Particles, and Minds

only power and function is to delude us into believing that it is helping us to create
a future that advances our felt values, while in actuality that future was predeter-
mined 15 billon years ago.
Realistically interpreted orthodox quantum theory thus provides us with a
non-materialistic science-based understanding of our own intrinsic nature. It is a
theory that accounts with spectacular accuracy for the structure of the empirical
facts about the external world discovered by atomic physicist during the twentieth
century. Many competent physicists struggled unsuccessfully for a quarter of a
century to comprehend those facts in every imaginable way concordant with the
materialistic word view, until Heisenberg, in 1925, lifting that restriction, but
clinging to the principle that the new theory should be built upon “observables”,
and hence in some way upon us observers, broke the log-jam in such a decisive way
that Pauli, Born, Jordan and others immediately jumped on board. Einstein, already
in 1928, nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize, which was
awarded to Heisenberg in 1932. The strangle-hold of materialism was broken
simply by the need to accommodate the empirical data of atomic physics, but the
ontological ramiﬁcations went far deeper, into the issue of our own human nature
and the power of our thoughts to inﬂuence our psycho-physical future.

Chapter 3
The Measuring Process
Minds, Brains, and Meaning
The ﬁnal chapter of von Neumann’s book is entitled “The Measuring Process”. But
the real topic is “us”, and our acquisition of knowledge. The core message of
quantum mechanics, in the words of Niels Bohr, is: “In the drama of existence we
are ourselves both actors and spectators.” It is our inﬂuence on our acts of acquiring
knowledge that allows us actors to transform a quantum world of potentialities into
actualities that are expressions of our values. It is these consequences of our probing
actions that give meaning to our lives.
Utility of Quantum Smearing
The feature of quantum mechanics that converts us from puppets to protagonists is
“quantum smearing”. This property stems directly from Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle. It allows our minds to be more than mere cogs in a giant machine, or
helpless witnesses to events they cannot affect. Quantum smearing gives us
important things to do, and the dynamical laws of orthodox quantum mechanics
endow our minds with the power to do them.
Einstein’s First Example
Einstein [5] offers a helpful example of quantum smearing. Suppose a single
radio-active nucleus is placed in a sphere and surrounded by a decay-detecting
device that, when activated by the decay of the nucleus, sends a signal to a
mechanism that causes a pen to make a blip (a spike) on a moving scroll.

Application of the quantum analog of the classical laws of motion, namely the
Process-2 Schrödinger equation, causes the physical blip to occur not just at one
single place on the moving scroll, but at a continuum of locations, each corre-
sponding to a possible time at which the nucleus might decay. If we then follow, via
Process 2, the ﬂow of information about the quantum state of the blip-containing
scroll into the brain of the observer, we ﬁnd that the brain will contain, for each blip
location in the quantum smear, the neural correlate of the perception of the location
of that blip. But the observer will actually perceive the blip to lie at a single small
portion of the smear of possibilities. Thus Process 2 cannot be the full story.
According to orthodox quantum theory, the dynamical partner of Process 2,
namely Process 1, inserts into the evolution of the quantum states an action (a
collapse) that is instigated and partially speciﬁed by the mind of the observer. Thus,
the observer’s mind, or ‘ego’, is actively involved in reducing the quantum smear of
potential perceptions to the single perception that an observer actually experiences.
Without these ‘smears’ there would be nothing for us to do: everything would be
pre-ordained, as in classical mechanics. Moreover, the important concept of
‘probability’ enters into the quantum dynamics precisely at the Process-1 action of
reducing the smear of potential perceptions to the one perception that is actually
experienced. Without the prior ‘smear’ of possibilities there would be no place, or
role, for quantum probabilities.
We are faced at this point with a deep problem that, in one way or another, has
challenged philosophers since the beginning of philosophy, namely the problem of
the nature of the connection of our conscious thoughts and perceptions to the
material world. Now, however, we are armed with a highly developed mathematical
structure that is focused precisely on this issue. As Dirac remarked in the preface to
his 1930 book:
This state of affairs is very satisfactory from a philosophical point of view as implying an
increasing recognition of the part played by the observer in himself introducing the regu-
larities that appear in his observations…
Von Neumann starts his discussion of the measuring process by emphasizing
that we generally inform ourselves about the physical world by means of percep-
tions of properties of systems located at some ﬁnite distance from our bodies. The
pertinent perceptual information about the system being examined is transported to
our brains by a sequence, or chain, of intermediate physical systems. Von Neumann
illustrates this point by describing a situation in which the information about the
temperature of liquid in a container is transferred to the observer’s brain by a path
that goes ﬁrst to a thermometer—a column of mercury—then to a beam of light,
then to the retina, then to the optical nerve, etc., and ﬁnally to a brain structure that
is the neural (or brain) correlate of the observer’s knowledge of the temperature of
the liquid. Each physical system in the chain can, under certain speciﬁed conditions
(described below) be regarded as part of a good measuring device that transmits the
key perceptual information from input system to output system without signiﬁcant
loss.

The Measuring Process

Quantum mechanics focuses primarily on relationships between our various
perceptions, and it is the faithful mapping of the perceptual structure to equivalent
forms along the chain that is of immediate interest here. An adopted “principle of
psycho-physical parallelism” asserts that this faithful perceptual chain is accom-
panied by a parallel quantum mechanically described chain that carries the asso-
ciated probabilistic information.
Von Neumann developed a detailed quantum model of a good measuring device.
If one considers a pair of simple quantum system as a single new quantum system,
and places it in a so-called “pure state”, then the one-to-one mapping between the
states of the two sub-systems—input and output—that is needed for a good mea-
suring device will prevail. Thus, in our example, the information about the blips on
the scroll will be carried, step-by-step, to associated features of the brain of the
observer. Most importantly, the quantum mechanically described chain that paral-
lels the perceptual chain will ensure that the statistical weights (probabilities)
associated with the different possible perceptions will be preserved. That is, there is
a probability preserving mapping of the perceived aspects of the external perceived
scene to corresponding aspects of the brain of the observer.
The Process-1 action that occurs in the observer’s brain, can thus be mapped
(backward-in-time and outward in space) via this chain of good measurements to a
faithful image of the Process-1 action occurring in the observer’s brain to any one
of the measuring systems along the chain, and ultimately out to the blips on the
moving scroll.
The Movable Heisenberg Cut
As already explained, quantum mechanics, unlike its classical forerunner, adopts
the view that science is properly about “our knowledge” of the underlying
matter-based reality, not directly about that material reality itself. And Heisenberg’s
key 1925 discovery was that in the quantum universe these two parts of nature
differ in very important ways. According to quantum mechanics, the mathematical
(Hilbert-space) structure of the underlying atom-based reality is very different from
the mathematical (4D space-time) structure of our conscious perceptions of that
reality. Hence, a person’s mind cannot simply perceptually grasp, directly, the
structure of the underlying quantum reality, because the quantum mechanical
structure of an observer’s brain is incommensurate with the classically describable
structure of that person’s perceptions. Some mind-brain linking process is needed!
In order to deal with this central problem in a rationally coherent and practically
useful way Heisenberg proposed that we conceptually divide reality into two
separate parts: (1), an atomically constituted and quantum mechanically described
observed system; and (2), a perceptually constituted and classically described
observing system. Von Neumann’s proof shows that we can, in each observation,
shift the placement of the “Heisenberg Cut” between these two parts to any chosen
position—along the tower of linked measuring systems that connect the perceived

system to its correlate in the observer’s brain—without altering the statistical
(Born-Rule) weights of the various alternative possible outcomes of that observa-
tion. One can consider the mind-matter transition to occur at any link in the chain of
“devices” without altering the predictions of the theory.
The proof rests ﬁrmly on the postulate that the basic causal dynamics is speciﬁed
by the orthodox quantum dynamics, even though the conscious perceptions are
experienced and described in terms of the classical-mechanical concepts.
Von Neumann describes the situation thusly:
Now quantum mechanics describes events which occur in the observed portion of the
world, so long as they do not interact with the observing portion, with the aid of Process 2,
but as soon as such an interaction occurs, i.e., a measurement, it requires an application of
Process 1.
This means that in the sub-systems in the tower that lie “external”, or “below”,
the Heisenberg cut one can use, for the individual perceivable possible outcomes,
their quantum mechanical descriptions, which specify their individual statistical
weights. But “above” the Heisenberg cut, including the brain itself, one can use the
perceptual description.
Our capacity, as theorists, to choose “which description to use where” is
essential, because we do not know the detailed quantum counterparts of our various
possible perceptions, yet need to know their statistical weights in order to be able to
make statistical predictions about the various alternative possible experiential
outcomes of our alternative possible probing actions.
This statistical information is available to us theorists precisely because we are
able to use the (experiential) perceptual description in the brain-side (or upper-side)
of the Heisenberg cut, but the quantum description—which carries the statistical
weights of the perceptual possibilities—on the (external/objective) lower side of the
cut, which contains the perceived physical system. The two descriptions are two
aspects of one possible response to a quantum probing action.
But what are those predictions? What determines, in our example, the theoretical
probabilities associated with the various alternative possible perceivable locations
of the blip on the moving scroll?
The probability that the blip will appear in a speciﬁed small region on the scroll
is determined by the decay rate of the radioactive nucleus. The (exponential) decay
process causes different statistical weights to be assigned to decays occurring during
different possible time intervals: the probability for the blip to appear in any small
time interval will fall off with time, as the source decays. Because the scroll is
moving, the probability will fall off also with a shift of the location of the blip on
the scroll. So the probabilities of different possible perceptions (of the blip location)
are unambiguously speciﬁed by the locations of the blips ‘out there’ on the scroll,
where they can later be perceived by the observer.
Thus the probabilities of the occurrences of the various alternative possible
perceptions need not be computed in terms of the probabilities of the neural cor-
relates of those perceptions. They can be computed, as just explained, in terms of
properties of features of the perceived scene. The quantum dynamics of the chain of
32

The Measuring Process

good measurements will then transfer this statistical information into the brain of
the observer, where it can inﬂuence nature’s (later) response to the observer’s
probing question.
It is, of course, extremely important that scientists be able, as in our example, to
deduce the predicted probabilities of possible Process-1 generated perceptions from
the associated properties of the perceived world, rather than from the detailed
properties of the neural correlates of our perceptions. That is because we lack the
capacity either to theoretically know, or to experimentally measure, in sufﬁcient
detail, the neural correlates of our perceptions. The spectacular successes of
quantum mechanics are not tied to a comparable understanding of the neural cor-
relates of our perceptions. The successes of quantum mechanics are based on the
statistical relationships between properties of our perceptions, not on a detailed
understanding of the brain correlates of those perceptions! This whole scheme
works because of the proof by von Neumann of the movability of the Heisenberg
Cut.
I have discussed this proof in some detail here both because of its central
importance in orthodox QM, but also in order to dispel any possible misunder-
standing
of
that
proof
that
might
suggest—because
of
its
use
of
the
classical/perceptual description on the upper/brain side of the cut—that macro-
scopic brain dynamics can be described classically. Von Neumann’s proof implies
no such thing! Macroscopic brain dynamics is quantum brain dynamics: Von
Neumann’s use of classicality in that proof is not a license to treat the dynamics of
our macroscopic brains classically.

Quantum Neuroscience
“The overwhelming question in neurobiology today is the relationship between the
mind and the brain.” These are the words of Francis Crick [2]. In the same venue,
famed neuroscientist Antonio Damasio [3] writes that the mind-brain question
“towers above all others in the life sciences”.
Given this recognized major importance of the mind-brain problem, you might
think that the most up-to-date, powerful, and appropriate scientiﬁc theories would
be brought to bear upon it. But just the opposite is true! Most neuro-scientiﬁc
studies of this problem are based on the precepts of nineteenth century classical
physics, which are known to be fundamentally false. Most neuroscientists follow
the recommendation of DNA co-discoverer Francis Crick, and steadfastly pursue
what philosopher of science Sir Karl Popper called “Promissory Materialism”. The
“promise” is the long-unfulﬁlled promise that rigid adherence to the precepts of
materialistic classical physics, which exclude minds from the dynamics, will lead to
a solution of the problem of the connection between our minds and our brains.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamentally incorrect classical physics has been com-
pletely unable to explain how your brain could be or produce your mind. The
occasional references to quantum mechanics that one ﬁnds in neuroscience are
concerned mainly with small-scale behavior at the molecular level, rather than with
the core issue, which is the connection of the total behavior of a person’s brain to
that person’s conscious thoughts.
What is the rational basis of the policy of replacing, as the basis of neuroscience,
our current hugely successful fundamental theory, quantum mechanics—which is
explicitly about the dynamics of the mind-brain connection—by the failed nine-
teenth century classical mechanics that excludes our minds from the dynamics?
The underlying reason why most scientists, and most Philosophers who are
interested in the mind-brain problem, adhere to this failed classical approach seems
to be their common belief that the “big” (macroscopic) features of brain dynamics
can be adequately described in terms of the concepts of classical physics—that only
tiny atomic-sized things need to be described in terms of the concepts and laws of
quantum physics. But standard (Copenhagen-von Neumann) quantum mechanics

says no such thing! Thus, insofar as we scientists admit that the contemporary
pertinent science should be used “in principle”, or at least tried, we should seek to
explain the empirical data of neuroscience and psychology in terms of the processes
1 and 2 described by von Neumann, rather than presume, because classical
mechanics worked for two hundred years, that the notion that our immaterial minds
can affect our material bodies must be some sort of illusion. The examined data
should include empirical ﬁndings pertaining to the connection between perceived
scenes and their neural correlates, and encompass also the every-day empirical
connections between a person’s mental intentions pertaining to his or her bodily
actions and the associated observed bodily actions.
In short, if one is interested in the mind-brain connection then the brain must,
according to contemporary basic science, be described quantum mechanically! The
associated classical description pertains to our perceptions, not the related brain
dynamics. So any attempt to understand the mind-brain connection that takes the
classical description to be describing our material brains, rather than our conscious
perceptions, conﬂicts with basic contemporary physics, which speciﬁes that von
Neumann’s dynamical rules—involving Processes 1 and 2—should be used to
describe the mind-brain connection. I take that approach to deﬁne “quantum
neuroscience”.
What’s the Matter with Matter?
The quantum mechanical description of the atom-based “material” reality is a
“bottom-up” description. It is erected upon the quantum mechanical representations
of the underlying atomic particles and ﬁelds. The quantum rules specify not only
how to mathematically describe such elementary quantum systems, but also how to
describe systems built out of combinations of many such quantum systems. The
dynamical rules specify also how these larger systems behave.
Our brains are made of the same kind of atoms that are studied in atomic
physics. The quantum description can thus be extended “all the way up”, so as to
include the entire world atomic-particle-built stuff, including the body and brain of
every observer. If science is rational, then it would be unacceptable for science to
simply baldly assert that the laws suddenly fail when things get ‘big’. Why do they
fail? How do they fail? How big is ‘big’? And how about the properties of big
things that depend upon the properties of their atomic constituents?
Problems with Materialism
There are four main problems with taking matter, as understood in materialistic
relativistic classical mechanics, to be the sole ontological foundation of reality. The
ﬁrst problem is that this classical concept provides no rational roots for the
36
4
Quantum Neuroscience

existence of our conscious thoughts, ideas, and feelings. There is nothing in the
classical conception of nature that provides any hint of any rational need for, or
rational foundation of, the existence of our known-to-exist mental aspects, which
thus need to be added, ‘ad hoc’, to the materialistic ontology—which makes it
non-materialistic. The second problem is Heisenberg’s 1925 discovery that the
process of acquiring knowledge of the material reality necessarily alters that reality
in a way that depends on Planck’s constant: the connection between the material
reality and our knowledge of it cannot be the simple action of direct knowing; some
assumption pertaining “knowing” or “experienced knowledge” needs to be added.
Quantum mechanics with its Processes 1 and 2, describes a complex process of
gathering knowledge that allows our mental intentions to inﬂuence our bodily
actions in intended ways not allowed by the precepts of classical mechanics. The
third problem is the conclusion established in Appendix 1. It demands that
faster-than-light (FTL) transfers of information cannot be banned in a context
completely described in terms of macroscopic classical concepts. But such FTL
transfers are banned in relativistic classical physics. Thus this FTL conclusion
falsiﬁes the belief that the connection between mind and brain can be understood
within the framework of relativistic classical mechanics. This FTL problem will be
discussed in detail later. The fourth problem is that the classical (Newtonian)
building blocks of reality are “solid”, whereas the atomic building blocks, being
the basis of mere “potentials for psycho-physical events” are evanescent. The
Newtonian particles are solid components of a supposed enduring physical reality
itself, whereas their atomic quantum replacements are components of mere ﬂeeting
potentialities for what the future might be. The two conceived realities are fun-
damentally different and incompatible, not merely different views of the same
reality.
Einstein’s Second Example
A second example of a quantum collapse mentioned by Einstein concerns a mouse
and the moon. Suppose there had been, since the birth of the universe, nothing that
interrupted its evolution in accordance with the (Process-2) Schrödinger equation.
Then the quantum state of the moon would be “smeared out” over the entire night
sky, until the ﬁrst observer, say a mouse, looks. Indeed, the mouse itself would be a
“smear” of copies of itself, and the city it inhabits would be a “smear” of all
possible cities (etc.), and similarly for the earth, for the solar system, for the
galaxies, etc.
In order to cope with the gross mismatch between actual human experience and
the matter-based aspects of the temporal evolution of the quantum world, the
creators of quantum theory went far beyond the precepts of classical physics. They
introduced into the quantum dynamics essential “acts of observation”, each asso-
ciated with a psycho-physical part of reality identiﬁed as an observing agent.
Problems with Materialism
37

Each such act is the initiation by the agent of a particular probing action. This
probing action “puts to nature” a particular question. As in the game of twenty
questions, each question is of the kind that is answered by either a “Yes”, or a “No”.
Multiple-choice situations can be accommodated by decomposing each answer
“No” into two parts: a “Sub-Yes” and a “Sub-No” etc. This creates a
multiple-choice scenario, with many possible “Yes’s” followed by one “No”.
Thus we have a question-and-answer scenario, where the questions are ‘freely
chosen’ by a mental ‘free agent, and answered and physically actualized by a global
mind-like (God-like) agent. But what is the character of this global process that
chooses, and then physically actualizes, the answers?
Nature’s Random Choices
According to quantum mechanics, the answer to the question is determined by “a
choice on the part of Nature”. The answer “Yes” is revealed to the probing agent by
the entry into his or her stream of consciousness of a perception that he or she was
asking about. For example, if the question is, “Is that ﬁre engine ‘red’?” then
Nature’s positive answer will be revealed to the agent by an experience of ‘redness’
added onto the previously existing perceptual form of the ﬁre engine. In the version
described here, negative answers are not experienced by the probing agent. This
allows for many negative responses to occur between any two positive responses. In
any case, “experienced reality” is created by dialogs between localized probing
agents and a global aspect of reality called “Nature”. The probing and answering
processes have certain characteristic properties that will be discussed presently.
The agent’s “choice” of question is, as already mentioned, not determined by
any known rule, and is thus called “free”. But Nature’s choice of response is subject
to certain deﬁnite conditions. According to the orthodox theory, Nature’s “choice”
is “random”. This means that in each individual instance, speciﬁed by an actual
choice of a question, the answer is indeterminate: it is not determined by the
dynamical rules of the theory. However, the theory does impose statistical condi-
tions on long strings of instances. For example, the predicted ratio of answers “Yes”
to answers “No” in a long string of “replications” is, according to the theory,
determined by mathematical properties of the physical state of the system being
probed. But which answer actual appears in an individual actual instance is not
determined by anything speciﬁed in the theory.
The infamous quantum element of “randomness” enters quantum mechanics
precisely in this way—and only in this way—through statistical conditions on
Nature’s choices. The mathematically determined evolution of the physical state via
the ﬁxed Schrödinger equation certainly plays a very important role in quantum
theory. But the connection of this mathematics to our experiences depends heavily
also on these two choices, the ﬁrst of which is “free”, and the second of which is
“random”.

Relativistic Version (RQFT)
The original versions of Quantum Mechanics were non-relativistic. The relativistic
generalization, Relativistic Quantum Field Theory (RQFT), was created in the late
1940’s—independently—ﬁrst by S. Tomonaga and later by J. Schwinger. A key
new feature is best described by comparing RQFT with the non-relativistic version.
In the non-relativistic version, each measurement event (consisting of a posed
question and a response by Nature) was assumed to occur globally over all space
“at an instant of time”.
In the relativistic version of RQFT, each measurement event is again mathe-
matically implemented by a “collapse/reduction” of the quantum state of the uni-
verse that occurs at a single “instant”. That “instant”, however, is a non-ﬂat 3D
surface [P(n)] that covers all of 3D space, but with different spatial 3D points
allowed to lie at different times—subject to the condition that no point on the
non-ﬂat “instant” can be reached from any other one without ever traveling at the
speed of light, or faster, or backward in time.
The basic process of the creation of the evolving physical state of the universe is
then “forward-in-time”, in the sense that each global “instant” is related to the
unique preceding one by, at some spatial point¸ (x, y, z), lying ‘later in time’ than
the preceding instant, but at no spatial point (x’, y’, z’) lying ‘earlier in time’ than
the time at that point (x’, y’, z’) in the 3D surface that constitutes of the preceding
instant.
Between any two successive instants, the quantum state evolves via a general-
ization of the Schrödinger equation, which is the quantum mechanical analog of
Newton’s classical equations of motion. The basic process of nature is thus forward
in time, even though the “Instants” along which the collapses occur are not the
non-relativistic “ﬂat” surfaces, all points of which lie at the same time. The tem-
poral advance from one global instant to the next can be conﬁned to a small spatial
region. This means, for example, that the ﬁrst phase of Process 1, namely obser-
ver’s choice of probing action, can be regarded as a local process, conﬁned to a
limited region, whereas the second phase, namely Nature’s choice of response,
turns out to be (see Appendix 1) non-local—i.e., faster-than-light!
The Role and Importance of Free Will
The linkage between the free question and the random answer ties the mental and
physical aspects of things into a single cohesive dynamically evolving reality. In
this evolution, the mental actions of observers play an essential role. Each Process 1
action (with positive outcome) leads to an increment in our collective knowledge,
making your probing mind a causally efﬁcacious active participant in the
psycho-physical process that contributes to this collective/joint knowledge. Your
“free choices” of probing actions, combined with nature’s responses, enter actively
Relativistic Version (RQFT)
39

into the determination of both your future psycho-physical states and the futures
also of other observers of the system observed by you.
Rational arguments lead (see Chap. 10) from the explicitly dualistic form of
Orthodox von Neumann Quantum Mechanics to the conclusion that all aspects of
Nature, including our own mental aspects, must be interacting parts of one “mental
whole”. Understanding oneself to be an integral part of a “mental whole” tends to
elicit a feeling of connectivity, community, and compassion with fellow sentient
beings, whereas the materialist notion of mechanical action and survival of the
ﬁttest tends to foster disregard of the feelings and welfare of others.
One’s entire approach to life tends to rest on whether one views oneself as an
efﬁcacious component of a “mindful whole”, or a tiny cog in an essentially
mindless machine, with a mysteriously attached but physically powerless mind that
pointlessly spins false delusions about its physical power.
A classical mechanistic powerless self-image can have a tendency to produce
attitudes of resignation, depression, hopelessness, pointlessness, and amorality.
However, the quantum self-image, which makes your mental valued-based efforts
causally
effective,
tends
to
create
a
more
dynamic,
elevated,
hopeful,
forward-directed, moral attitude. Recent experiments by psychologist Jonathan W.
Schooler and others reveal a positive empirical correlation between people’s belief
in free will and the morality of their actions. Quite generally, your attitude and
actions depend strongly on your beliefs about yourself in relation to the reality in
which you are embedded. In today’s educated world, your beliefs about these
matters are likely to depend strongly upon what you believe science says you are.

The Physical Effectiveness of Conscious
Intent
A Brief Review
Classical mechanics says that your thoughts cannot affect the behavior of particles;
but realistically construed orthodox quantum mechanics says they can.
The original Copenhagen quantum theory was designed by its founders merely
to reliably predict relationships between what we do—the experiments that we
perform—and the outcomes that we then observe. Thus, even at this initial stage of
quantum mechanics, we observers do not just passively witness; we also purpo-
sively act. We choose, on the basis of our personal values, what our atom-built
brains and bodies will do. These actions are often tied to our imagined perceptions
of perceived events that might occur “out there”, and in the future.
But when formalized by the work of von Neumann, the theory produces a
dynamical conception of reality that can automatically–explain—without any
change in the dynamical rules—not only the statistical relationships between our
probing actions and our resulting perceptions, but also the capacity of a person’s
mental intentions to inﬂuence that person’s bodily actions in the way that he or she
mentally intends. That is a signiﬁcant development: an automatic explanation of
how a person’s free-willed intentional mental effort can inﬂuence, in the intended
way, that person’s bodily actions. Quantum mechanical dynamics thus joins
together what classical mechanics has rent asunder: our minds and our bodies.
According to the standard quantum principles, our choices of which probing
actions to perform, and when to perform them, are not determined by any quantum
mechanical law. These choices enter the theory as free (un-coerced-by-material-
causes) choices. And a suitable structuring of those free choices can tend to make
your physical body move in accord with your mental intent.
How can this come about? How can something as intangible as a mental
intention, cause physical objects such as your arms and legs to move in intended
ways? By what process can the motions of your ﬁngers come to express the
complex thoughts that you intend to express in written words?

The Quantum Zeno Effect
Within the Orthodox Quantum Mechanical description of nature, this physical
power of your conscious thoughts can arise from a well-known rigorous property of
quantum mechanics known as the Quantum Zeno Effect, and sometimes as the
Anti-Quantum Zeno Effect.
Suppose a physical/material system is being probed by an observer whose
mental aspect, his ego, is free to choose a sequence of probing Yes-No questions
that will elicit responses, Yes or No from nature. And suppose this ego would like
the observed system originally observed to be in state “Phi(0)” to move from that
state to a perceived ﬁnal state q(1) along a smooth path q(t) as t changes from t = 0
to t = 1. Then the quantum mechanical laws of motion entail that if the ego chooses
to pose at each time n/N in the set of times {1/N, 2/N, 3/N, … n/M, …, N/N} the
question “Do I perceive the observed system to be in the state q(n/N)?”, then the
probability that all N responses of nature will be “Yes” tends to unity (i.e., one) as
N tends to inﬁnity: all of nature’s responses will, by virtue of the Born Rule, almost
surely be “Yes” if N is sufﬁciently large. Thus by a suitably rapid choice of probing
questions the observer can, by its choices of these questions, effectively control
both the perceived responses and the associated material reality that is being
perceived.
Because the observer’s choices are stemming from the mental realm, there is no
known limit on exactly how rapid these free choices can be. But it is reasonable to
suppose that survival consideration make this effect far easier to use if the action is
directly an action on the observer/actor’s sensitive brain than on a perceived brute
external system.
Thus the behavior of the brain, according to Orthodox Quantum Mechanics, is
not completely determined by prior physically described properties of the universe
alone, but can be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by “free choices” made by human
observers pertaining to which probing action to instigate, and when to do so. Here,
again, the “free” in “free choice” means, speciﬁcally, that this choice is not
determined by prior physically-described aspects of the universe alone. Our con-
scious free choices and mental efforts enter naturally, according to the quantum
mechanical dynamical laws, into the evolution of the psycho-physical universe.
I shall describe next how, within Orthodox Quantum Mechanics, the simple
holding-in-place action produced by the Quantum Zeno Effect can tend to make a
person’s physical actions conform to that person’s mental intent.
Templates for Action
Suppose, for example, that you are struggling unsuccessfully to put a heavy object
onto a truck in order to make needed home improvements. Suppose you are
mentally wrestling with whether to try harder, get help, or give up.

The Physical Effectiveness of Conscious Intent

It is reasonable to suppose that in this situation your brain will construct, via
bio-physical processes, and on the basis of previously learned habits and responses,
several different patterns of neurological activity, each of which would, if held in
place for a sufﬁciently long period, while the other patterns are suppressed, send out
a sequence of neural impulses that would cause your body to behave in one of the
possible ways responsive to your plight. Such a neural pattern is called a “template
for action”.
This situation can be analyzed within either orthodox QM or classical
mechanics. If one uses classical mechanics then the fact that in classical mechanics
our minds enter only as passive observers means that that theory can give no
dynamical explanation of the connections between, on the one hand, your feeling of
making a mental choice/effort to actualize some intended bodily actions, and, on the
other hand, the associated responding movement of your physical body—for your
mind is required to be causally inert: not part of the dynamics. But why should
one’s mind exist if it is not logically entailed by the classical material activity, and
has no function? And why should it delude us into believing it is causally effective
if it is really doing nothing? And how can we actually construct a purely
(mind-independent) material dynamics that gives the same predictions as the
empirically successful combination of Processes 1 and 2 that brings our
known-to-exist minds into the dynamics in a way that conforms to how it feels to
behave as we do, and that is in harmony with the evidence of every-day experience?
Because we know that our thoughts and mental efforts exist, and hence probably
have an important function, is it not an irrational tour de force to try to show that
they exist yet have no causal power? Why should we try to evade using such a
wonderful theory that is so well deﬁned, both mathematically and logically, and that
works so well in practice, instead of trying to more fully exploit it?
If one simply adds, ad hoc, to classical mechanics the postulate that certain brain
activities “produce”, or “are”, the associated conscious thoughts, then a correlation
between brain activities and consciousness is imposed by a ﬁat having no logical
roots in the classical physical theory. It causes our consciously instigated probing
actions to become postulated effects of physical brain actions, not their causes, as in
quantum mechanics, and it consequently reduces us to effectively thoughtless
‘mechanical automata’.
But why is this seventeenth century notion, which is so despised by so many
philosophers, and which is so contrary to our ﬁrst-hand feeling of what we are—and
is so seemingly absurd and senseless—be such a compelling desiderata today, when
it has been reversed by the superseding hugely successful contemporary quantum
physics? This current theory recognizes our experience-based knowledge as both
the proper foundation of science and also an essential part of the cause of the
Process-1 choice of probing action. Why should this reasonable, useful, and
well-deﬁned role speciﬁed by contemporary physics be rejected in favor of what
seems a total absurdity about our minds proclaimed by a failed seventeenth century
false start that makes our lives a farce?
Templates for Action
43

The quantum alternative is a mind-matter dualism in which our minds, by virtue
of their capacity to freely choose probing questions, combined with nature’s
Born-Rule-restricted reply, allow us to tend to actualize the bodily actions that we
mentally intend! Our minds do matter in a way essential to our physical survival,
well being, and purpose.

Reality and Spooky Action at a Distance
Spooky Action at a Distance
Quantum mechanics has a peculiar feature that Einstein called “Spooky action at a
distance”, and which he found problematic. The problem arises under certain
realizable empirical conditions involving two different experiments performed at
essentially the same time in two far-apart experimental regions. Under the speciﬁed
empirical conditions, the computational rules of quantum mechanics assert that the
psycho-physical event initiated by the “free choice” of experiment made in one
experimental region instantly changes the quantum state that controls the quantum
predictions about outcomes appearing in the faraway region. The empirical validity
of these predictions has been amply conﬁrmed by experiments of a kind ﬁrst
performed in the early 1980s by French experimentalist Alain Aspect and his
colleagues, and that are by now quite commonplace.
The key phrase “free choice” means that the choice of which large-scale mea-
surement procedure is performed in the region can be selected whimsically by the
experimenter, or by a quantum random number generator, or by any other process
that is effectively uncorrelated to the system being measured. The essential point is
that the quantum prediction for what will be consciously perceived depends directly
upon which experiment is set up and performed, but not upon the manner in which
that experimental setup is chosen: the process of choosing the experiment is
required/presumed to be dynamically independent of the system being probed by
the experiments. This lack of dependence is generally agreed to mean that the
choice that emerges from the process of choosing the experiment can be treated, in
the analysis of these experiments, as a locally generated free variable.

The Quantum Dynamical Origin of “Spooky Action”
The “spooky action” arises within the quantum mechanical formalism from the fact
that the quantum state of the entire physically described universe is deﬁned at each
instant of the advancing sequence of instants of time (or at a relativistic general-
ization of an instant of time) at which a “collapse” occurs. And this state represents
an objective (collective) state of the known physical state of affairs over all of 3D
space at that instant of time. If, at some instant, nature makes a choice of response
to a probing action that is localized in some conﬁned spatial region then, according
to the basic quantum rules, the quantum state of the universe changes not just in that
local region, but over all of 3D space at that instant of time. This abrupt global
change is called a “collapse” or a “reduction” of the quantum state. Einstein called
this global collapse “spooky action at a distance”, and believed that no such
nonlocal action could be physically real.
Evasion via Pragmatism
Theoretically explicit and essentially instantaneous actions at a distance occur in
quantum mechanics in conjunction with the collapses/reductions of the quantum
state. These collapses are essential features of practical quantum mechanics: They
are needed to keep the quantum state in line with our empirical knowledge. But the
existence of such transfers of information conﬂicts with Einstein’s theory of rela-
tivity, which limits the speed of the motion of physical matter, and, correspond-
ingly, the speed of any transfer of information, to the speed of light.
The founders of quantum mechanics did not want to admit or suggest that, in
deﬁance of the theory of relativity, information could really be transmitted
faster-than-light. Hence they evaded the problem by adhering to the pragmatic
position that the “physical state of affairs” represented by the quantum state was not
a representation of physical reality itself, but something more akin to human
knowledge than to classically conceived matter. Being also unwilling to defend the
idea that the physical state represents some absolute kind of knowledge, which
would mean a retreat to an “idealism” deemed antithetical to science, the founders
adopted the evasive position that the quantum mechanical state was merely part of
an invented practical human tool for making predictions about upcoming empirical
ﬁndings. Thus no claim was made that the quantum mechanical state represented
“reality”; no claim was made about any “real” property of nature itself! Direct
conﬂict with Einstein’s ban on “real” faster-than-light transfer of information was
thereby dodged.

Reality and Spooky Action at a Distance

The EPR Paper
The assumed absence of any real “spooky action at a distance” was the basis of an
effort by Einstein to prove that a quantum mechanical description could not provide
a complete description of physical realty. In 1935 he wrote, in collaboration with
two young colleagues, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, one of the most
renowned scientiﬁc papers of all time [6], entitled: “Can Quantum Mechanical
Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?” This paper is usually
identiﬁed by the initials of the last names of its three authors—‘EPR’. It assumes, in
concordance with the theory of relativity, that information cannot be transferred
faster than light, and then argues, on the basis of the predictions of quantum
mechanics, that this theory cannot provide a complete description of physical
reality. But the authors opine that a complete (and non-spooky) theory of physical
reality is possible.
Bohr’s Response to EPR
The easy response to EPR by the founders would have been to simply re-emphasize
that quantum mechanics does not claim to describe physical reality itself. However,
a simple response of that kind would have sparked, among scientists who aspire to
be more than high-level engineers, efforts to ﬁnd a more complete theory. Making
such efforts is exactly what Einstein believed scientists interested in basic questions
ought to be doing, but what the founders of quantum mechanics believed that
potentially useful scientists ought not to be doing. Thus Niels Bohr, the senior
founder of quantum mechanics, chose to answer EPR by focusing on the slippery
question of what constitutes physical reality.
What, exactly, is “physical reality”? A logically sound argument pertaining to
“physical reality” requires giving some deﬁnite meaning to that phrase. But our
ideas about physical reality are deeply inﬂuenced by our experiences of the world
around us, which seem to conform to the principles of classical physics. Thus, any
proposed characterization of physical reality is in jeopardy of being challenged as
resting on intuitive classical ideas alien to the quantum precepts, and hence as being
prejudicial: as begging the question.
The EPR paper was built, therefore, not upon some notion of “physical reality”
that could be attacked as obscure, unscientiﬁc, or question-begging. It rested,
instead, on the demand—enshrined in Einstein’s theory of relativity—that infor-
mation cannot be transmitted faster than light. The opening for using this demand
was slipped into their famous “Criterion of Physical Reality”. This criterion asserts
that “If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e.,
with a probability of unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an
element of physical reality corresponding to that quantity.” The requirement
“without in any way disturbing” was met by considering situations in which the

possible disturbance would require faster-than-light action. EPR were then appar-
ently able to conclude that a certain pair of properties (that were represented by
non-commuting operators) were both physically real, and hence simultaneously
deﬁnable, although the principles of quantum mechanics are unable to encompass
that possibility. Thus the quantum mechanical description was proved to be
incomplete.
Of course, a simple alternative conclusion would be that faster-than-light actions
can occur!
Most of the EPR argument was straightforward physics and not open to chal-
lenge. But it depended upon one metaphysical element, the EPR Criterion of
Physical Reality, which begins with the words, “If without in any way disturbing a
system …”
Bohr [7] attacked this metaphysical element of the EPR argument in a subtle
way. Bohr states:
Of course there is in a case like that just considered no question of a mechanical disturbance
of the system under investigation during the ﬁnal last critical stage of the measuring
procedure. But even at this stage there is essentially a question of an inﬂuence on the very
conditions which deﬁne the possible types of measurements regarding the future behavior
of the system. Since these conditions constitute an inherent element of the description of any
phenomena to which the term ‘physical reality’ can be properly attached, we see that the
argumentation of the mentioned authors does not justify their conclusion that the quantum
mechanical description is essentially incomplete.
Bohr argued, however, that quantum mechanics was pragmatically complete,
which, in the end, is what matters most to most physicists, who could now, if
challenged about the failure of science to talk about physical reality, refer to Bohr’s
reply to the EPR argument pertaining to that issue.
Notice that the EPR argument is based on the matter-related assumption that, in
physical reality, information cannot be transferred faster than the speed of light;
whereas Bohr’s argument is based on the pragmatic idea that our understanding of
nature should be based, not on prejudicial presumptions about imagined–to-exist
matter, but on our actual knowledge, and on the possibilities of our future
knowledge. So the conﬂict comes down to the question of the proper foundation of
science: Is it the materialistic concepts of the classical physics stemming from the
postulates of Isaac Newton? Or is it what we actually know, or are able to know, as
was urged by David Hume and the other empiricists.
In spite of this fundamental disagreement, the two protagonists did agree on one
key point: There could be no real transfer of information over space-like intervals.
But that presumption is proved wrong under the weak conditions of the proof given
in Appendix 1. That proof rules out Einstein’s classical-matter-based conception of
physical reality, but is completely compatible with the psycho-physical conception
of reality speciﬁed by von Neumann’s orthodox formulation. There is no need to
retreat from the idea that a rationally coherent basic realistic physical theory,
namely realistically construed orthodox QM, can accommodate: (1), the ﬁndings of
48

Reality and Spooky Action at a Distance

atomic physics; (2), the classical character of appearances; (3), the evidence for the
causal effectiveness of our mental intentions; and (4), “spooky actions at a
distance”.
Bell’s Theorem and the Nature of Reality
Historically, this controversy lay semi-dormant, with practicing physicists generally
siding with the pragmatic position of Bohr, until John Bell wrote a paper [8] based
on the notion of “hidden variables”. Bell’s hidden-variable approach added to the
usual assumptions of the validity of the empirical predictions of quantum
mechanics, and the notion of effectively “free choices” on the part of the experi-
menters, the further assumption that there is an underlying invisible “hidden”
physically described substructure that carries the causal connections. In exact
analogy to classical statistical mechanics, each empirical situation is represented by
a sum of statistically weighted physically deﬁned possible “real states of the system
being studied. Following Bell’s lead, these quantum analogs of the physically
deﬁned possible “real” states of classical physics are labeled by the Greek letter
“lambda”.
This hidden-variable quantum theory is applied in the context of the
(Bohm-Bell) experimental situation, which involves two spin-1/2 particles existing
initially in a certain (e.g., singlet) spin state. These two particles then ﬂy apart in
opposite directions to two far-apart experimental regions, in each of which a
measurement is performed. These two far-apart measurements are performed at
essentially the same time in the common rest frames of the two experiments. The
measuring device in each region has two alternative possible settings. So, alto-
gether, there are four settings under consideration and for each setting, two alter-
ative possible outcomes.
One of these alternative possible outcomes is labeled with an identifying label
“plus one” and the alternative possible outcome of the same measuring process is
labeled with a “minus one”. (I am assuming here, for simplicity, perfect geometry
and 100% efﬁcient particle detectors, and shall stick to this idealized case).
Each possible real state lambda of the universe speciﬁes which one of the two
alternative possible measurements is performed in each region, and, for each of
these two possible measurements, which one of the two alternative possible out-
comes of that measurement occurs. The choices of which measurements are per-
formed
in
the
two
regions
are
treated
as
two
free
variables,
and
the
“no-faster-than-light-transfer-of-information condition” (No-FTL) is imposed by
requiring the outcome in each region to be independent of which measurement is
chosen and performed in the far-away region.
Bell’s analysis is based on a “correlation function”. This function speciﬁes, for
each of the four considered pairs of settings that include one setting in each region,
the “degree of correlation” between the labeled co-occurring outcomes in the two
regions. This correlation function is a number that can vary from the value plus one
Bohr’s Response to EPR
49

(if the labels of the co-occurring outcomes in the two different regions always
agree) to the value minus one (if the label of the occurring outcome in one region is
always opposite to the label of the co-occurring outcome in the other region. This
function is deﬁned, for each pair of settings of the devices that has one setting in
each of the two regions, by averaging the product of the labels of the co-occurring
outcomes in the two different regions. Here “averaging the product of the labels”
means summing over the product of the four alternative possible combination of
paired labels, {(1, 1), (1, −1), (−1, 1), (−1, −1)}, dividing by 4, and weighting each
pair with the quantum probability of that possible combination of the two far-apart
outcomes, for the speciﬁed-by-lambda pair settings of the two devices.
The key step of Bell and associates is to invoke the demand for no
faster-than-light-transmission-of-information (No-FTL) by converting, for each
ﬁxed lambda, the contributions to the correlation function into a product of two
separate factors, each containing the dependence on both the choice of setting and
the choice of outcome in just one of these two factors.
Thus No-FTL is implemented by Bell by factorizing the formula for the cor-
relation function! But this factorized form cannot be simultaneously valid for a
certain four alternative possible choices of the pair of settings in the two regions.
Thus implementing NO-FTL in this way leads to a contradiction.
If this factorized form were to be acceptable, then the hidden-variable theory
could, with some justiﬁcation, be said to represent a certain “local realism”. That
title, “local realism”, is the title that its proponents seem to prefer, to “local
hidden-variable theory”, in conjunction with their claim that “No local realistic
theory can be compatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics.” But that
wording invites drawing certain logically unwarranted conclusions.
The hidden-variable theory can reasonably called “realistic”: it is basically
similar to classical statistical theory, which rests on the normal classical idea of real
material worlds. If a certain “locality” condition is then imposed, and contradictions
with empirical data and quantum predictions ensue, then it might seem that, given a
demand that the basic theory must describe reality, nature must be nonlocal, con-
trary to Einstein’s demands.
However, there are other ways to achieve a realistic ontology, and one of them
might be able to evade the need for non-locality. Hence FTL is not entailed merely
by the need for it in the hidden-variable model.
Moreover, it has been well-known since a 1984 paper of J. Jarrett that factor-
ization is equivalent to the conjunction of “parameter independence” and “outcome
independence” (in the terminology of A. Shimony). Parameter independence is the
same as No-FTL transfer. So the failure of the factorized formula to accommodate
the quantum predictions (and the empirical data) entails either FTL transfer or
“outcome dependence” (the dependence of the outcome in one region on the
“outcome” in the other region). But “outcome dependence” is the normal feature of
the empirical predictions in the situations under consideration here. Hence one
cannot conclude from the failure of factorization that there must be FTL transfer of
information: the failure of outcome independence sufﬁces to account for the failure
of factorization.

Reality and Spooky Action at a Distance

An actual proof that there must, under appropriate conditions, be FTL transfer of
information is given in Appendix 1. It achieves what the hidden-variable approach
may seem to claim to achieve, namely the need for FTL transfer of information
about experimenter free choices, but does not logically achieve.

Chapter 7
Backward-in-Time Causation?
Orthodox Quantum Mechanics is based on the idea that a physically described state
of the universe exists at an instant of time over all of three-dimensional space, and
advances, event by event, into an indeterminate future, leaving behind a ﬁxed and
settled sequence of past states. Certain phenomena associated with this chain of
events appear to involve backward-in-time causation, but they are accommodated
without introducing any actual backward-in-time action. It is important for a valid
understanding of nature to understand how orthodox quantum mechanics accom-
modates seeming backward-in-time actions.
Delayed Choice Experiments
John Archibald Wheeler [9] described an experiment that seemed to show that an
experimenter’s “free choice” about which experiment he or she performs at one
time can affect what happened at an earlier time. The essential point can be illus-
trated by the following idealized version.
Suppose you have super-sensitive vision and can detect individual photons
falling upon your retina. Imagine that you are looking through one eye at a screen
with two small holes, through which light of a visible frequency is moving in your
direction. Quantum Mechanics says that if you focus your vision on the screen, and
the light is sufﬁciently weak, and your vision is sufﬁciently sensitive, you will see
the individual photons passing essentially one at a time through either one hole or
the other. But if you choose to focus, instead, on a location far behind the screen
then the photons will still come one at a time, but will build up a complex inter-
ference pattern that depends on the distance between the two holes, apparently
showing that the light associated with each individual photon has, in some sense,
passed through both holes. Thus, what happens earlier at the screen, namely the
individual photons passing through both holes, or passing through just one hole,
seems to depend on your later choice of how to focus your eye.

Essentially the same experiment can be performed with devices that act so fast
that the choice between the two alternative possible focal lengths can be made by a
random number generator after the photon has passed through the screen. Thus it
would appear that, in some sense, the photon either passes exclusively through one
slit or the other, but not both; or, alternatively, through both together, depending on
which kind of observation is chosen after the photon has already passed through
the hole or holes.
This kind of experiment is called a “Delayed Choice” experiment, and various
reﬁnements of it have been designed and successfully carried out by Scully and
colleagues [10]. The observed phenomena certainly conform to the just—described
predictions of quantum theory, but the ‘causal implications’ need further discussion.
The “Bohmian” Approach to Explaining ‘Causal
Implications’
For example, one proposed way to understand quantum mechanics was advanced in
the early days of quantum mechanics by physicist Louis de Broglie. It was then
pretty much abandoned due to criticisms by Pauli, but resurrected and developed by
David Bohm [11] in the 1950s. This way of understanding the success of quantum
mechanics asserts that there really is a classical-type world of tiny particles, but also
a wavelike quantum state of the universe that evolves always in accordance with the
Schrödinger equation, and hence never “collapses” in association with an increase
in “our knowledge”, as speciﬁed by both the Copenhagen and Orthodox versions of
Quantum Mechanics. In Bohm’s no-collapse Quantum Mechanics the function of
the wave is to “guide” the particles, which are assumed to be the aspects of Nature
that control our conscious experiences.
In this “Bohmian” model of reality the changes made in the focusing of your
eyes inﬂuence the evolution of the quantum wave within your eyeballs, and this
change in the wave, which travels through both holes, inﬂuences the trajectory of
the photon (particle of light), which travels though only one hole, when it lies inside
your eye, which is focused in one way or the other. This theory correctly accounts
for the delayed-choice phenomena without invoking, in our two-slit experiment,
any notion of backward-in-time action or ‘causation’. The difference in what is
observed is due to the classically understandable causal effect upon the trajectory of
the photon on the way the eye is focused—or in other versions of the experiment,
on the details of experiment determined at the last moment by an independent
random number generator (RNG).
This Bohmian approach does account for the physical properties, considered as
self-determining physical properties. But the classical demand that these particles
interact essentially by contact interactions in ordinary 3-D space is grossly violated
in the two-observer FTL experiment. In that experiment, which experiment an
54
7
Backward-in-Time Causation?

experimenter in one spatial region decides to perform can have a big effect on
which outcome appears at essentially the same instant in a very faraway laboratory.
And, as in classical physics, the theory says nothing about our minds.
If “science” is properly about our growing knowledge, then the theory is fun-
damentally incomplete, for it offers no rational account of how the physical
description that it provides is tied to our evolving mentally described knowledge,
and how, if at all, our mental intentions inﬂuence the activities of our brains, and
hence bodies.
Bohm himself addressed this problem, and was forced to replace his original
simple non-local theory by a very complex one in which the mystery of mind is
transferred to a mystery about an inﬁnite tower of observing systems, each
observing what was physically happening in the level just below. The simplicity
and attractiveness of his original quasi-classical quantum theory was lost when he
tried to incorporate our human experiences. But incorporating our causally effective
mental intentions is exactly what realistically construed orthodox Quantum
Mechanics achieves! It offers a rationally coherent mathematically formulated
description of reality that includes an account of how our mental intentions inﬂu-
ence our physical behavior in a way that is concordant with all the empirical
evidence, instead of defaming us by claiming our most important human quality,
the capacity of our mental intentions to inﬂuence our bodily actions, an illusion or
delusion. The price to pay for this increase in rational understanding is a failure of
Einstein’s classical-physics-based intuition that information cannot travel faster
than light. But in quantum mechanics one has, instead, the property that no “signal”
(sender chosen message) can be sent faster than light. This weaker property of
quantum mechanics sufﬁces to maintain in the quantum world the essential
empirical requirements of the theory of relativity.

Chapter 8
Actual Past and Historical Past
The evolving history of the universe is normally regarded as being divided into
three parts: past, present, and future. The present instant “now” separates the past
that has already happened from the future that has not yet happened. One idea of the
nature of things is described by the phrase “closed past, open future”. It indicates
that the past is already ﬁxed and settled, whereas the future is not yet determined.
Another idea is the “block universe” in which every event in the entire history of
the universe is already pre-determined: is already fated to be exactly what it was, or
will eventually turn out to be.
Deterministic classical mechanics is usually regarded as deﬁning a “block uni-
verse”. Einstein considered the universe to be a block universe, and his theory of
special relativity dealt with many different ways that one can assign 4 coordinates
(x, y, z, t) to the space-time points in this block universe in which the entire
pre-determined course of the history of the universe is laid out: there is no real
“becoming”.
Orthodox Quantum Mechanics, on the other hand, is based on a forward-in-time
process consisting of a well-ordered sequence of psycho-physical events that are
associated with a well-ordered sequence of “instants” “now”, each of which is a
smooth 3D surface in the 4D space-time. Each such surface is later at some point,
but earlier at no point, from its immediate predecessor, as already discussed in
Chap. 3.
Associated with each present instant “now”, labeled by “r”, there is a state
(density matrix) of the universe “q(r)” that deﬁnes, via the “Born Rule”, the
probabilities of the various alternative possible outcomes of the probing
action/question posed by the observer associated with the collapse event located on
that present instant “r”. The state of the universe, q(r) can be called the “actual
past” of the instant r: it is the immediate past that partially controls, in conjunction
with the observer’s probing question, the collapse occurring on the instant “r”.
This collapse event has, according to the orthodox collapse interpretation,
changed the immediate future potentialities by eliminating from them all causal
effects that stem from those parts of the prior quantum state that were eliminated

by the collapse that occurred at the instant “r”. The new set of immediate future
potentialities is, because of this collapse that occurred at the instant “r”, different
from what it had previously been. Consequently, the “actual past”, does not pro-
vide the pertinent-to-the-future representation of the past.
The representation of the past that is pertinent to the future is the one that
smoothly
evolves,
according
to
the
continuous
laws
of
motion—the
Schrödinger-like equation—into the quantum state that has just been created. This
causally pertinent state of the past is called the “effective past”. It is speciﬁed by
evolving the newly created state backward in time, by means of the inverse of the
pertinent Schrödinger-like equation. Thus, the “actual past” is the state of the
universe that existed just prior to the present instant “now”, whereas the “effective
past” is the part of that past state that smoothly evolves into the immediate future,
and therefore pertains to the potentialities associated with the next instant. Between
the two instants the state evolves via Process 2.
The “effective past” contains, in particular, the records of those parts of the past
that have survived the recent collapse, and are thus relevant to the current future.
Since the “effective past” contains these surviving records, it is the part of the actual
past that we can in principle recall. The rest of the actual past is eradicated by the
collapse, and is forever non-recoverable.
These important aspects of quantum mechanics are succinctly captured by an
assertion made in the recent book “The Grand Design” by Stephen Hawking and
Leonard Mlodinow: “We create history by our observations, history does not create
us” [12].
We, by our free (asserted to be un-coerced by matter) choices of our probing
questions, inﬂuence the evolving form of the material universe by means of the FTL
effects of these choices on a sequence of global (nonlocal) collapse events.
The rules of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory (RQFT) ensure, however, that these
instantaneous actions can never be used to send a sender-controlled message
“faster-than-the-speed-of-light”
to
an
actual
receiving
intelligence.
Hence
Einstein’s demand of “no-faster-than-light transfer” of information is in fact sat-
isﬁed in orthodox QM insofar as this “information” is “sender-controlled infor-
mation” that becomes known to a receiving observer.
Thus, insofar as one accepts that we live in a real quantum (not effectively
classical) universe described by orthodox quantum mechanics, in which our choices
of our probing actions are not coerced by material processes, care must be taken to
make distinctions that have no counterpart in Classical Mechanics – for example,
whether the effect is on the consciousness of an actual person or upon quantum
potentialities for a collection of four alternative possibilities at most one of which
can actually happen.
To see how these considerations play out let us consider the “Wheeler delayed
choice experiment”. At the moment that the pulse of light is passing through the
holes, the quantum wave that represents the light is divided between the two holes.
58

Actual Past and Historical Past

If, at a later time, the observer sees the photon coming through the left-hand hole
then, according to the rules of orthodox quantum mechanics, a global collapse will
occur: the parts of the quantum state incompatible with that experience will be
obliterated. The new state, representing the potentialities for the future experiences
of all observers, will be the continuation into the future of the surviving part of the
prior state. The continuation of the new state backward in time, using the
Schrödinger equation in reverse, is the effective past. The existing evolving state is,
as Hawking and Mlodinow state, created by our observations (together with nat-
ure’s responding actions). All future experiences of all observers will be concordant
with the empirical fact that the photon was seen by some observer to pass through,
say, the left-hand hole.
The evolving situation during the time that the pulse of light was passing
through the screen was that the wave was passing through both holes. That fact is
ﬁxed and settled: it is never revoked. But if the observer poses the question “Do I
see the light coming through the left-hand hole”, and Nature’s response is “Yes”,
then the quantum state collapses to the part compatible with the observer’s expe-
rience. This state, extended backward in time via the Schrödinger equation acting in
reverse, will have the light wave passing through the left-hand hole, and the effect
of this observation will be incorporated into all future experiences of all observers.
All of this is logically captured and mathematically represented by von Neumann’s
conception of the nature of things.
This orthodox way of understanding the apparent backward-in-time effects uses
only strictly forward-in-time evolution of the quantum state. It achieves an expla-
nation of an apparent retro-causation by using the orthodox forward-in-time
dynamics.
Some of these rules lead to the continual generation of “smears” of alternative
classically conceivable, but mutually incompatible, possible worlds. Other orthodox
rules govern the collapses of this evolving quantum state. These collapses sys-
tematically trim away the branches of this growing quantum state that become
irrelevant to the future. These branches have become irrelevant because they led to
possibilities that were probed by observing actors/agents, and were eliminated by
Nature’s choice of reply.
Each such Nature-produced collapse, although precipitated by the probing action
of some localized observer, is a global event. It instantly alters aspects of the
quantum state that pertain to observations about to occur in faraway regions. This
instantaneous effect (“spooky action at a distance”) is incompatible with the
no-faster-than-light-transfer conditions asserted by Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.
By proving that these “spooky actions at a distance” are unavoidable conse-
quences of a few well-veriﬁed predictions of quantum mechanics pertaining
exclusively to macroscopic phenomena, without introducing any conditions per-
taining to microstructure, the theory rules out the possibility that the world of
macroscopic phenomena can be rationally understood as being built out of classi-
cally conceived matter. Materialism is ruled out.

The important implication of this analysis is that it rules out a notion prevalent
among philosophers and scientists interested in the mind-matter connection that
quantum effects pertain only to microscopic processes, and that, apart from the
elements of quantum randomness, the quantum character of reality somehow
magically disappears at the level of macroscopic physical processes. There is no
science-based justiﬁcation to believe that the behavior of the brain of a conscious
person can be understood in terms of the concepts of classical physics: The “pro-
mise” in what Sir Karl Popper called “Promissory Materialism” conﬂicts with
contemporary basic science.

Chapter 9
The Libet “Free Will” Experiments
According to nineteenth century classical physics, reality is described in purely
physical terms, and is deterministic: the world is described in terms of mathematical
properties attached to space-time points, and the future is completely determined by
the past, by virtue of mathematical conditions on these properties. This
formerly-believed feature of nature is called the “Causal Closure of the Physical”).
In stark contrast, the purely physical aspects of the quantum laws determine
from the physically described aspects of the past only a “statistical mixture” of
future potential physical worlds. Thus the purely mechanical aspects of the quantum
mechanical laws of motion have a “causal gap”: they do not determine from the
physically described aspects of the past the physically described aspects of the
future, but only a quantum statistical mixture of such aspects. ‘Something else’, or
‘something more’, must enter into the causal structure in order to determine the
‘nature of reality’ under consideration at this speciﬁed point in time. This lack of
determinateness (inherent in quantum mechanics at this stage of determining the
‘nature of reality’) is not resolved simply by specifying the value of some “quantum
element of chance”.
According to the basic precepts of standard (“Copenhagen-von Neumann”)
Quantum Mechanics, a reduction of the uncertainty represented by this quantum
statistical mixture requires that a particular probing action, speciﬁed by a ‘Yes/No’
question, be chosen by an observer. Furthermore, an answer, ‘Yes’ or ‘No’, is
required to be chosen and reiﬁed (made concrete or ‘actualized’) by Nature. As a
result, two key questions arise:
(1) What determines which ‘Yes/No’ question the observer will choose?
and
(2) What determines Nature‘s answer, ‘Yes’ or ‘No’?
The answer to the second question is that the answer, in the form of the binary
‘Yes’ or ‘No’, is determined by the ‘infamous quantum element of chance’. But
what determines which ‘Yes/No’ question the observer will choose?

In actual scientiﬁc practice, the answer to this question is determined by an
observer’s personal choice of what to attend to. This choice is deﬁnitely not
determined by the quantum physical laws, and it is, in that speciﬁc sense, a “free
choice”. This choice is thus ‘naturally determined’ (within the “Copenhagen-vN”
framework) by the observer’s mental aspect, and hence from values embedded in
the observer’s mental aspect, his “ego”.
These quantum mechanical precepts can be illustrated by showing how they
work in practice, in the famous “free will” experiments performed by Benjamin
Libet and his associates (Libet 1985)1.
Introduction to Libet
We all feel that certain of our conscious thoughts can, and often do, cause our
voluntary bodily actions to occur. Our lives, our institutions, and our moral
philosophies are largely based on that intuitive sense of how the world works. In
fact, the entire notion of “cause” probably originates in that deep-seated feeling or
intuition.
An evidence-based argument against this basic intuition—that our thoughts can
inﬂuence our bodily actions—stems from an experiment performed by Benjamin
Libet and his associates (1985, 2003). In this experiment, a human subject is
instructed to perform (voluntarily) during a certain time interval, a simple physical
action, such as raising a ﬁnger. Libet found that a measurable brain precursor (the
“readiness potential”) of the “conscious choice” to promptly perform an action,
occurs in the brain about one-third of a second prior to the occurrence of the
psychologically experienced act of “willing” that action to promptly occur.
This empirical result appears, on the face of it, to show that the conscious act of
“willing” must be a consequence of the associated brain activity, not the cause of it.
For, according to the normal idea of cause, a “free choice” cannot cause a prior
happening to occur.
This example is just one instance of a general feature of mind-brain phenomena,
namely the fact that a conscious experience of choosing often seems to occur after a
lot of preparatory work has already been done by the brain. This fact, combined
with the classical mechanics precept of the “Causal Closure of the Physical”, leads,
plausibly, to the conclusion that the felt causal potency of our conscious choices is
an ‘illusion’.

The Libet “Free Will” Experiments

Libet in a Quantum Mechanical Framework
However, an examination of this Libet experiment, viewed from the perspective of
the quantum framework (developed in the mid 1920s by the founders of quantum
mechanics to deal with observed physical phenomena, and cast into logically and
mathematically rigorous form already in 1932 by John von Neumann), shows these
Libet results to be in good accord with both (1), the quantum-postulated freedom of
those human choices from physical coercion, and (2), the capacity of those value-
based intentional mental choices to inﬂuence the chooser’s future bodily actions in
the intended manner.
Any dynamical theory, to be relevant to our experienced lives, must link the
dynamics to our streams of conscious experiences. Quantum theory is built squarely
upon the demand that this condition be met. It is a psycho-physical dynamical
theory that has causal connections between human brains and minds built intrin-
sically into it, in a way that allows our conscious choices to be both free of physical
coercion yet causally potent in the physically described world.
In spite of this obviously extremely pertinent twentieth century revision of the
relevant physical principles, contemporary neuroscience and philosophy of mind
largely continue to base their quest to understand human consciousness on the
inadequate nineteenth century classical mechanical conceptualization of reality,
which contrary to standard quantum mechanics, leaves our consciousness com-
pletely out of the causal dynamics.
The Libet Causal Anomalies
We often resolve to act in some speciﬁed way at some future time, and then meet
this commitment with great precision. The brain, recognizing in the sensed input a
need for an appropriate action, immediately begins to build a template for such an
action. According to the ideas of William James, this template can be activated by
an act of “consent”, on our part, at the later time when the future ‘commitment’ is to
be fulﬁlled.
In the Libet experiment, an initial instruction is given to the subject to willfully
perform an action at some future time, say within the next few minutes—an act of
‘raising a ﬁnger’. In the Libet case, the instruction is imprecise as regards the exact
time of the called-for action. Because of this latitude in the timing of the willful
action, the physical brain will presumably construct a sequence of alternative
“templates for action”, each designed to produce the speciﬁed action at a ‘different
alternative possible time’.
For the earlier templates, the urgency is low and Nature’s reply will more likely
be “No” (it doesn’t really have to be done, yet). In accordance with principles
described in earlier chapters, all recorded traces of these early failed attempts will
be banished from the realm of recorded possibilities. Finally a “Yes” response
Libet in a Quantum Mechanical Framework
63

occurs, and that outcome is recorded. But all potentialities that do not lead to the
outcome “Yes” (that actually occurs), are eradicated by the earlier “No” collapse
events. This leaves the record only of the ﬂow of potentialities that do lead to the
template for action that is actually manifested: no record of the earlier potential-
ities that failed to manifest will survive the earlier collapses. And the still-forming
templates for now un-needed actions will probably also dissolve.
The processes in play here begin with automatic actions in the brain, which
(responding to inputs from the surrounding physical world) constructs appropriate
templates for action. This process is accomplished essentially in the same way that a
classical-physics-based neuroscience might suggest. Each such template, if held in
place for a sufﬁciently long period, while all conﬂicting activities are annihilated,
will send out a sequence of neural pulses that will (if Nature’s consent is given)
produce a physical action. That is what templates for action do, if held long enough
in place.
The observer’s ego, surveying what is going on in its brain, selects, on the basis
of its values, a template for action (which has been constructed by the brain) and
asks whether what it (the ego) is experiencing is the perception which signiﬁes that
the selected template has been actualized. A positive feedback will inform the ego
that its choice of probing action has inﬂuenced its steam of conscious experiences in
the intended way
Only the “Yes” responses are experienced or remembered. The brain records of
the failed attempts are annihilated by the associated collapses: a mental experience
associated with a “No” response can in general not even be deﬁned.
Libet Conclusion
The quantum mechanical understanding of the mind-brain dynamical system
explained and defended in Schwartz (2005), and further elaborated in Stapp (2005,
2006), accommodates and explains the ability of our conscious intentions to
inﬂuence our physical behavior. This theory covers in a natural way the Libet “free
will” data. It reconciles Libet’s empirical ﬁndings with the capacity of our con-
scious intentions to inﬂuence our physical actions, without these intentions being
themselves determined by the physically described aspects of the theory.
This empowerment of the mental participation of the observer/individual per-
ceiver is achieved by exploiting a “causal gap” in the mathematically expressed
laws of quantum mechanics. This “causal gap” is ﬁlled, in actual scientiﬁc practice,
by invoking the conscious intentions of the human participants. This practical and
intuitively-felt role of conscious intentions is elevated, within the quantum ontol-
ogy, to the status of an ontological reality, coherently and consistently integrated
into quantum laws.
The Libet experiments are discussed further in the next chapter.

Questions and Answers About Minds
The foregoing chapters have elucidated a science-based view of reality that I call
“Realistically-Construed Orthodox Quantum Mechanics”. It is profoundly different
from the essentially Newtonian conception represented by classical mechanics.
A comprehensive comparison of the two views in the preceding chapters has shown
classical physics view to be inadequate in its treatment of reality, compared to that
of Realistically Construed Orthodox Quantum Mechanics. Nevertheless, that
classical physics view of reality is still employed by most contemporary philoso-
phers, psychologists, and neuroscientists working on the problem of the connection
between the mind and the brain. I comment on this situation by giving brief answers
to ﬁve questions that I was asked at a recent meeting.
Question (1):
“Why bring conscious thoughts into the dynamical laws as
independent inputs instead of allowing all mental properties to be
determined by physical properties as in classical physics?”
Answer:
Francis
Crick,
co-discoverer
(with
James
Watson)
of
the
double-helix structure of DNA, was a leading ﬁgure in the
movement to recognize consciousness as a respectable/acceptable
subject for scientiﬁc study. His inﬂuential 1994 book, “The
Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientiﬁc Search for the Soul”
contains the famous passage:
“You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and ambitions, your sense of
personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast
assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.” He maintained, moreover,
that the laws of classical physics would be generally adequate in the study of
consciousness, and that quantum physics would be needed only for tiny molecular-
scale technical details.
Crick’s close associate, Christof Koch, has become a leading ﬁgure in neuro-
science, but has backed away from Crick’s ideas to some degree. At a recent small
meeting in Berkeley, prior to Koch’s talk (one in a long lecture series on “Unsolved
Problems in Vision”), I questioned Crick’s claim that conscious thoughts “are in

65

fact no more than” brain behavior. Koch promptly ridiculed that idea: “There are no
yellow patches in the brain when experiences of yellow are occurring!” The
philosopher, John Searle, was also present at that meeting. John and I hammered
away at the lack of any theory (understanding) of the connection between these two
(now admittedly different) things—conscious thoughts and ‘brain behavior’.
I also focused attention on a passage in the paper (on Integrated Information
Theory (IIT)) that Koch was expounding upon, which said: “IIT takes no position
on the function of experience as such”. It takes no position on whether “experience
as such” does anything. But in his verbal response, it became clear that his position
(like that of most neuroscientists) is that it is the brain/body that is doing every
physically described thing: that our experiences are idle spectators that are created
by the brain but have no reciprocal ‘reactive effect’ upon it. Our experiences have
no reason, within the classical conception of reality, to exist at all: no job to do.
However, the classical physics conception is known to be profoundly inappro-
priate, and pursuing it has led to a growing number of very difﬁcult”Unsolved
Problems in Vision”. Ontologically-construed RQFT is a radically different con-
ception of the connection between our experiences and our brains that accounts
rationally, and in mathematical detail, for all well established empirical data from
planetary dynamics to atomic physics. In that conception, our conscious experi-
ences play a critically needed dynamical role that makes “your joys and your
sorrows” and your “free will” into the causally effective mental-type realities that
they seem to us human beings to be.
How scientists view these matters is not just a matter of words, for those views
control the research in ﬁelds of neuroscience and cogitative science.
Question (2):
“Is it not true that the interaction of observed systems with the
surrounding environment will account for the emergence of
classical appearances, and thereby eliminate the need for the extra
process that orthodox and Copenhagen Quantum Mechanics
introduce via the quantum collapse?”
Answer:
The answer is ‘No’—it’s not true! The interaction with the
environment leaves the quantum state of the system being studied
in a “quantum statistical mixture”, which is generally a continuous
“smear” of classically describable possibilities of the kind that we
actually experience, each with zero probability to be actualized. To
select the experience that actually occurs, some discrete selection
process is needed.
Copenhagen and Orthodox QM deal with this need by means of an ordered
sequence of two-part reductions, each consisting of a Process-1 “free choice” of a
probing ‘Yes/No’ question made by a conscious observer, combined with a “ran-
dom choice” of the answer, ‘Yes’ or ‘No’, made by Nature. The “free choice” is
“free” in the sense of not being ﬁxed by the physically described aspects of the
theoretical structure (either alone or in conjunction with the famous quantum
“random” element, which is connected to”Nature’s” choice). Without this two-part
selection process, or some substitute, the theory would fail. In particular, the effects
66
10
Questions and Answers About Minds

of the environment on the system of interest are not sufﬁcient to account for which
particular experience actually occurs!
Question (3):
“How do you account for results of the experiments of Benjamin
Libet and others which show that an associated brain action, called
the ‘readiness potential’, precedes the mental act of consciously
willing one’s ﬁnger to move?” The fact that this brain activity
precedes the willful act has been used by some authors to claim that
the experience of willfully causing the physical act is a conse-
quence of the brain’s causing the ﬁnger to rise, not a cause of that
physical action. That view is in line with the physicalist theories of
the mind, which claim that a person’s mind is simply a feature of
the physically determined activities of that person’s brain.”
Answer:
In order for a person to decide to perform a particular contemplated
action, there must be a brain representation of that contemplated
action. In Libet’s experiments, the subject is instructed to perform a
simple motor task (e.g. raise a ﬁnger) at some future time
(implicitly understood to be some unspeciﬁed time in the next few
minutes). According to the orthodox theory, this input instruction
initiates a brain activity of constructing potential “templates for
action” for various alternative possible actions that meet the
speciﬁed temporal conditions. The early phase of each alternative
possible “readiness potential” is a consequence of the brain activity
of constructing such a “template for action”, which involves also an
account of the projected experiential consequences of initiating this
action.
It was emphasized by William James that a contemplated action does not
actually occur until an “act of consent” is given. In the Orthodox QM account, the
process of consenting (or of allowing the potential action to become a part of the
experienced communal reality) is initiated by a Process 1 probing action. As
stressed before, this probing action is not ﬁxed by the known physical laws. An
initiating input coming from some other source is required.
Libet, mistakenly from this quantum point of view, associated the rise of the
readiness potential with a decision to act. Then, to rescue “free will”, Libet was led
to his idea of a “free won’t”: a later decision by the observer that can override the
supposed prior decision to act. But, according to the quantum model, the early part
of this rise is merely a concomitant of the process of constructing a “template for
action” that will only later, by virtue of a mental choice, be picked out from among
the many potential templates that have been constructed in parallel by the
Schrödinger-equation-controlled evolution of the quantum mechanical state of the
brain of an observer. As explained in the chapter on apparent backward-in-time
action, the only one of the parallel construction processes that will leave a record
will be the one leading to the template selected by Nature to be actualized.
The records of the others are destroyed by the collapses. This explains the rise of
the readiness potential before the subject’s free choice of probing action that
10
Questions and Answers About Minds
67

produces—subject to Nature’s positive response—the physical action that actually
occurs. The “free choice” by the observer of what to observe and when to observe it
thus enters in an essential way into the course of physical events. Our effortful
mental intentions thereby become causally effective in the physical world.
Question (4):
“Since mind is elevated to a basic role in your quantum view of
reality, how do you distinguish those views from Western idealists
such as Berkeley and from Eastern Philosophies based on Buddhist
and Hindu teachings?”
Answer:
All of these views arise from the empiricist premise that our
understanding of reality should be based on the structure of the
realities that we really know exist, namely our streams of conscious
experiences. Since these various views all start from a mental
foundation, and seek to produce a rationally coherent parsimonious
narrative concordant with the physically described character of
what we see around us, it is not surprising that they all arrive at
somewhat similar conclusions. But the Eastern versions are more
intertwined with Indian ideas of Karma, reincarnation, and lore
than the Western versions that evolved in the context of Greek
thought, Christianity, and the rise of science.
Question (5):
“If mind is an important aspect of reality, then what do you say
about the world before life emerged?”
Answer:
I was asked this same question by Heisenberg, in his solicited
comments
on
my
1972
AJP
article
“The
Copenhagen
Interpretation”. Mentioning Plato’s notion of absolute ideas, he
suggested [MM&QM p.76] that perhaps: “It is ‘convenient’ to
consider the ideas as existing even outside of the human mind
because otherwise it would be difﬁcult to speak of the world before
human ideas have existed.” That answer is in line with the
science-based conclusion in Chap. 11, that the physically described
reality represented by the quantum mechanical state of the universe
is most rationally understood as an idea in a universal mind, of
which our human minds are tiny partially isolated parts.
A reviewer of this book emphasized the relevance of a 2012 paper of Schurger
et al. [21] in which the occurrence of self-initiated movement events are triggered
not by mental interventions but by physical ﬂuctuations of a “leaky statistical
accumulater”. This model is applied to the case in which the standard Libet task of
moving a thumb at an unspeciﬁed time is modiﬁed by an overriding instruction to
“immediately” perform the speciﬁed action. The new action turns out to be pre-
ceded by a more extended in time RP (readiness potential) than when a less urgent,
more relaxed, demand is issued.
The empirically observed temporal evolution is in very good agreement with
their three-parameter ﬁt, which they interpret as evidence in favor of their purely
physicalist model of Libet-type data. But it is not clear that it is evidence against the
validity of orthodox mind-dependent vN quantum mechanics. Indeed, the need for a
68
10
Questions and Answers About Minds

template for a very sharply deﬁned time of action would surely demand longer to
prepare, than one for a more loosely deﬁned time of action: more precision with the
same tool (the same brain) would require more preparation time. It would certainly
be a very major result if the Schurger data were to be actually incompatible the
orthodox von Neumann-Copenhagen interpretation. So the Schurger result cannot
be an actual problem for the orthodox mind-dependent dynamics being described in
this book.

Chapter 11
The Fundamentally Mental Character
of Reality
The realistically construed orthodox quantum mechanics described in this book has
three components: (1), A physically described universe represented by an evolving
quantum mechanical state; (2), An ordered sequence of probing questions that arise
in the minds of observers; and (3), A “nature” that chooses and implements—in
concordance with Born’s statistical rule—psycho-physical responses to the probing
questions posed by observers.
The minds of observers, being possessors of thoughts, ideas, and feelings, are
“mental” in character, while the quantum state of the universe, being a general-
ization of the classical state of the universe, is often assumed to have the same
ontological character or status as its classical analog.
The classical state of the universe, according to Isaac Newton, is composed of
“solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles”. The classical state is thus
said to be “matter-like” in character, not “mind-like”. It is the carrier of enduring
conserved properties such as energy and momentum.
However, the quantum mechanical counterpart of the material classical state of
the universe represents mere potentialities for future psycho-physical happenings.
These potentialities are images of what the future perceptions might be. The state
that carries them, like the potentialities they carry is evanescent: it is beset by
quantum jumps that are linked to mental events. Hence the quantum state is more
like “an idea” about something, which rapidly changes like an idea does, when new
information becomes available, than like a material substance of classical
mechanics that tends to endure.
The foregoing summary leads to the conclusion that, in terms of its behavior, the
ontological character of quantum reality is more mind-like than matter-like.
That conclusion is far from new. It has been explicitly proclaimed by many
distinguished quantum physicists of the past, as the quotations assembled below
make clear.
I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness.
(Max Planck quoted in the Observer, 25 January 1931.)
“The universe is of the nature of a thought or sensation in a universal Mind.” “To put the
conclusion crudely – the stuff of the world is mind-stuff”. “It is difﬁcult for the

matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental
character. But no one can deny that mind is the ﬁrst and most direct thing in our experience,
and all else is remote inference – inference either intuitive or deliberate.”
(Sir Arthur Eddington, 1928, The Nature of the Physical World, Chap. 13):
In 1961 Erwin Schrödinger wrote:
… it comes naturally to the simple man of today to think of a dualistic relationship between
mind and matter as an extremely obvious idea. … But a more careful consideration should
make us less ready to admit this interaction of events in two spheres—if they really are
different spheres; for the … causal determination of matter by mind …would necessarily
have to disrupt the autonomy of material events, while the …causal inﬂuence on mind of
bodies or their equivalent, for example light…is absolutely unintelligible to us; in short, we
simply cannot see how material events can be transformed into sensation or thought,
however many text-books, in deﬁance of Du Bois Raymond, go on talking nonsense on the
subject.
These shortcomings can hardly be avoided except by abandoning dualism. This has been
proposed often enough, and it is odd that it has usually been done on a materialistic basis.
….But it strikes me that …surrender of the notion of the real external world, alien as it
seems to everyday thinking, is absolutely essential.
….If we decide to have only one world, it has got to be the psychic one, since that exists
anyway (cogitate—est). And to suppose that there is interaction between the two spheres
involves something of a magical ghostly sort; or rather the supposition itself makes them
into a single thing. (Schrödinger, My View of the World, pp. 61–63}
Einstein arrives at essentially the same conclusion (of the mental character of the
reality implicit in standard quantum theory) when he complains that: “What I
dislike about this kind of argumentation is the basic positivistic attitude, which from
my point of view is untenable, and which seems to me to come to the same thing as
Berkeley’s esse est percipi.” [To be is to be perceived.] (Albert Einstein:
Philosopher-Physicist, Schilpp, p. 669)
Einstein also says that: “What does not satisfy me, from the standpoint of
principle, is its attitude toward what seems to me to be the programmatic aim of all
physics: the complete description of any (individual) real situation (as it supposedly
exists apart from any act of observation or substantiation).” (ibid. p.667)
But Einstein is tacitly demanding concordance with a failed materialistic clas-
sical dynamics that is unable to account for the empirical facts. Physics has now
advanced to a form that seeks to account only for those aspects of reality that are
associated with acts of observation or substantiation. And, as regards the classically
supposed irrelevance to reality of our acts of observation or substantiation, William
James opined: “It is to my mind quite inconceivable that consciousness should have
nothing to do with a matter it so closely attends.” [20].
What human consciousness does, according to ontologically construed orthodox
QM, is to initiate, by its choice of a probing action, a response on the part of nature
that actualizes some aspect of reality that was, until then, merely a potentiality.
Thus our conscious efforts become causal players in the game of converting
potentialities to actualities, and thereby inﬂuencing reality.

The Fundamentally Mental Character of Reality

According to realistically interpreted orthodox QM, we are not the helpless
witnesses that classical mechanics claimed us to be, but are, instead, causally
effective agents in the creation of an evolving reality. Thus as Bohr repeatedly, and
rightfully, reminded us: “In the drama of existence we are ourselves both actors and
spectators”. That was Heisenberg’s seminal 1925 discovery, which constitutes the
foundation of our quantum mechanical understanding of the nature of things!
Universal Mind
All that we human beings really know exist are our own mental experiences. But we
are relatively recent newcomers to the world revealed by astronomical and arche-
ological observation. Hence there is good reason to believe that there exists, in
addition to these evanescent human mental elements, a more enduring reality within
which our mental aspects are embedded, or from which they emerge. Thus we can
ask: What is the nature or character of this more enduring reality?
The basic message of quantum mechanics is that this underlying reality has, on
the basis of its behavior, the same ontological character as the mental realities
embedded within it—not the character of the Newtonian-type matter that was
postulated to exist by classical mechanics. The underlying reality in quantum
mechanics has the ontological character of human thoughts, ideas, and feelings, not
the character of solid particles. Thus all of reality is made of one single kind of stuff,
and there is no logical problem of the kind that plagues classical physics. Classical
mechanics bans the minds of the observer from the matter-based dynamics, whereas
quantum mechanics bans Newtonian-type matter from the basic dynamics, and
makes mind basic.
Macro-non-locality
The complete lack of micro-level conditions in the Appendix 1 proof of the logical
need for essentially instantaneous long-distance information transfer is fatal to
theories, or to philosophical positions, that claim that quantum mechanics pertains
only to microscopic properties, and hence that the principles of relativistic classical
physics work just ﬁne in the realm of large visible properties. The Appendix-1
derivation of quantum non-locality under exclusively macroscopically speciﬁed
conditions directly refutes that claim.
The failure of many workers on the mind-brain or mind-matter problem to take
into account this profound impact of the quantum mechanical character of reality
within the strictly macroscopic realm has been the source of a widespread perni-
cious belief that quantum mechanics has little or nothing to do with the big
questions of the basic nature of world, and of ourselves. That belief inspires the
related notion that the consideration of quantum effects can be relegated to spe-
cialists who are interested in the atomic minutiae, while thinkers concerned with the
big human issues can pursue their thinking (apart from the intrusion of the quantum
elements of random chance) within the simpler framework of classical physics,
which excludes our minds from the causal dynamics. But, according to quantum
mechanics, the inclusion of the effects of our mental intentions upon the macro-
scopic behavior of our brains and bodies is absolutely essential to a correct
11
The Fundamentally Mental Character of Reality
73

understanding of the dynamical role of our human minds in workings of nature, and
hence to a valid self image.
Some quantum physicists have dreamed up non-orthodox ways of trying to
capture the quantum aspects of nature, while leaving our minds out of the
dynamics. But such theories are necessarily incomplete, compared to the orthodox
theory, because they cannot describe the dependence of our physical behavior upon
our mental intentions, which are left completely out of the dynamics. A theory that
can explain neither the empirical data of atomic physics nor the ubiquitous expe-
rienced effects of our intentional known-to-be-real thoughts may be simpler than
orthodox quantum mechanics, but is fundamentally deﬁcient, because it is
incumbent upon it to explain the data of atomic physics that bafﬂed physicists from
the 1913 quasi-classical Bohr model of the atom, until the 1925 introduction by
Heisenberg of the non-trivial causal effects of our observational actions.

Chapter 12
Paranormal Phenomena
Quantum theory was originally formulated as a non-relativistic theory. It was
assumed that there was a “preferred” coordinate frame that labeled each point in the
4D space-time by three spatial coordinates x, y, and z, plus a time variable t. The
quantum state of the full physical universe was deﬁned at each time t, and it evolved
from an earlier time t1 to a later time t2 by the action of well deﬁned (unitary)
operator U(t2, t1).
The time t, as deﬁned by this preferred coordinate frame, played a special role: It
deﬁned, for each possible value of t, a 3D surface that constituted a possible
“present instant now” that separates a t-dependent past from a t-dependant future.
The evolving history of the universe was tied to this ever-increasing value of the
time t.
The key idea Einstein’s theory of relativity was that there should be no
dependence of the dynamical rules that generate the evolution of the physical
universe on such a preferred frame. The key idea of RQFT was the idea of
Tomonaga and Schwinger about how to evade all dynamical dependence on any
such preferred frame. They introduced, in place of the ﬂat constant-time 3D sur-
faces t = constant, the notion of space-like surfaces r. Every pair of different points
on such a surface are connected by a space-like vector.
There is a well-ordered discrete sequence of such surfaces r(n) such that the
integers n label the well-ordered sequence of instants “now” along which the
famous “collapses”, or “reductions” of the quantum state of the universe occur. The
surfaces r(n) for integer n are temporally ordered in the sense that for some 3D
location (x,y,z) the time t(x,y,z,n + 1) is greater than t(x,y,z,n), and for every (x,y,z)
the time t(x,y,z,n + 1) is greater than or equal to t(x,y,z,n). And there is a unitary
operator U(n’.n) that transforms the state just after the collapse at r(n) to the state
just before the collapse at r(n’).
The unitary U(n’,n) is the natural extension of the non-relative U(t’,t) from the
case of the ﬂat constant-time surfaces t = t(n) surfaces to the case of the non-ﬂat
space-like surfaces r(n). Tomonaga and Schwinger introduce the so-called inter-
action representation, which has the effect of causing U(t’,t) to be the effect of only

75

the “interaction” part of the (Hamiltonian) operator that generates the temporal
evolution. This part is local, and hence U(t’,t) expresses the local character of the
underlying dynamics. U(n’,n) inherits this feature.
This all may sound rather complicated, but it merely allows the ideas of von
Neumann’s detailed theory of measurement, involving the input of an observer’s
“free choice” of probing action followed by nature’s global physical response, to be
carried over essentially unchanged to RQFT, with the earlier role of the constant-time
3D collapse surfaces played now by the frame independent surfaces r(n)!
The various paranormal phenomena to be considered here involve a stimulus
chosen by a quantum random number generator QRNG and then applied to a living
subject, with a physiological response by the subject detected signiﬁcantly before
the action of QRNG, and dependent upon the yes-or-no choice generated by the
QRNG. Such behavior contradicts the local forward-in-time property of orthodox
RQFT.
I do not try to judge validity of the claims of anyone who claims to have found
such results, but merely note, ﬁrst, how such results could be caused by a biasing of
the Born Rule in favor of outcomes positively valued by a human being, or
favorable to the welfare of some other kind of biological entity. A quantum-like
theory modiﬁed only in this way, but preserving the rest of the von Neumann
described mathematical psycho-physical formalism, I call a “quasi-quantum
mechanical theory”!
I shall also describe a very feasible critical experiment that could support, or rule
out, this proposed explanation.
The experiment I shall consider is basically the same as the famed “erotic
picture” experiment reported by Cornell psychologist Daryl J. Bem. In this
experiment a human subject is seated in front of two opaque screens behind each of
which lies a computer window. The subject told that behind one of the two screens
will soon appear an interesting picture, whereas behind the other will appear only
an uninteresting blank wall, and that (s)he should now choose eventually to look
behind the screen which (s)he “feels” or “guesses” the interesting picture will soon
appear!
Shortly after his or her choice of the screen to look behind is made, and securely
recorded, a 50–50 random number generator, QRNG1, chooses the screen behind
which the interesting picture, not a blank wall, will appear, and another 50–50
random number generator, QRNG2, decides, in the picture case, whether the
appearing picture will be erotic or non-erotic. Orthodox QM predicts that in the
subset of instances in which either an erotic or non-erotic picture appears the subject
will, in *50% of the instances, choose to look behind the screen behind which the
erotic picture will later appear. But Bem reports that, roughly 53% of the time, the
subject chooses, at the outset of the experimental trial to look behind the screen
where QNRN2 will only later choose to place the erotic picture!
This result seems to demand either clairvoyance, in which the subject’s sub-
conscious somehow knows in advance what QRNG2 will do, or psychokinesis, in
which the observer’s mental aspect somehow inﬂuences the physical mechanism
(of picture placement) tied to QRNG2’s random choice. Another possibility is a
76
12
Paranormal Phenomena

biasing of nature’s Born-Rule-governed choice, at the conclusion of experimental
trial, of what the subject will eventually perceive. Such a biasing of nature’s ﬁnal
choice of what the observer perceives at the conclusion of the trial could also
account for the Bem-reported *3% seeming aberration of the choice that the
subject made at the beginning of the trial.
And there is also the consideration that careful attention must be paid to the
important difference between the “actual past” and the “historical past” discussed in
Chap. 8, and to the associated profound truth proclaimed by Stephen Hawking and
Leonard Mlodinow: “We create history by our observations, history does not create
us”. Our reconstructed history is based on our presently existing records of the past,
and these preserved records lack, by virtue of the collapse event, the records that
record the processes leading to the possibilities that were ruled out by a collapse
event and hence do not survive that collapse event. So the history constructed from
the records that exist after a quantum collapse event differs from the history con-
structed from the records that existed just before that collapse event. History is thus
effectively revised not just because of human efforts to re-write it (e.g., for political
reasons), but also because of nature’s corruption of the records of what was going
on before the collapse!
In the Bem experiment under consideration here, if none of the above-mentioned
effects are operative, then the fact that nature chooses 50% of the time to exclude all
records of the potentialities that were not actualized would mean that in the
reconstructed history there never was a potentiality for what did not happen to
happen. It would seem like nature’s actions caused the things that did not happen to
not happen: It would seem that, within the orthodox theory, there must be
retrocausation!
I believe that there is a clearly favorite option, which I call SPK, or special
psycho-kinesis. The proposal to violate the Born Rule is tantamount to abandoning
quantum theory, and thus should be put on a far back burner. But SPK respects the
Born Rule, and might almost be considered a natural part of orthodox QM.
SPK is a conceivable feature of nature that would allow a conscious agent’s
mental effort, or intent, to inﬂuence a physically described processes lying in the
forward light cone of the agent’s body, which is a region that includes the agent’s
body. That one’s mind can inﬂuence one’s future actions is a center-piece of
orthodox QM, and much of the paranormal could be explained if this power of
mind were to extend beyond the perceiving subject’s body. Thus in the Bem
experiment the “adventurous” aspects of the subject’s mind would be allowed to
inﬂuence the physical mechanisms that control the placement of the erotic pictures,
and inﬂuence it in a way that will advance what the subject values or intends. Thus,
in accord with “The (reputed) power of positive thinking”, (and also remarks of
William James) the agent would hold in mind the perceived desiderata, and “na-
ture” would then tend to bring it into being. Such an arrangement would allow our
minds to effectively do what standard quantum mechanics says they are doing,
together with certain aspects of the paranormal, instead of creating merely:“The
illusion of conscious will”

Conclusions
Scientists discovered in the twentieth century that our Minds Matter: that we are not
the pre-programmed mechanical automatons that classical Newtonian physics had,
for two hundred years, proclaimed us to be. They explained, moreover, how our
minds matter: how such intangible things as our mental intentions and consciously
felt values inﬂuence the behavior of our material bodies. They showed why our
mental selves are not, as had been widely believed for two centuries, and are still
believed by physicalist philosophies, mere passive witnesses to an inexorable
sequence of material events that lie completely beyond the capacity of our thoughts,
ideas, and feelings to affect in any way. But quantum mechanics entails that we are
not mere material robots deluded by “the illusion of conscious will”. Our conscious
will is rather, by the means explicitly spelled out in realistically interpreted
orthodox von Neumann Quantum theory, able to substantially affect our individual
physical lives in ways causally driven by our consciously felt values.
According to the orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics, the basic
dynamical process involves a “free choice” on the part of an observer of what
perceivable property of the observed system is to be probed, or inquired about. Here
the word “free” in “free choice” stipulates that this choice is not fully determined by
the material aspects of reality alone, but is inﬂuenced by an input from the mind of
the observer. This shift in the basic dynamical structure of nature elevates our
conscious mental aspects from causally inert by-products of physical brain activity
to active participants in the unfolding of a dynamically integrated psycho-physical
reality.
This revision of the mind-brain dynamics eliminates the seeming absurdity of a
consciousness that exists but can make no difference in what happens. Such a causal
inertness is in direct conﬂict with the ubiquitous evidence of everyday life, which
strongly indicates that one’s mental intentions normally inﬂuence one’s bodily
behavior in essentially the intended way.
The quantum understanding of the world, involving the causal efﬁcacy of our
minds, while incompatible with the prejudices of the “classically scientiﬁcally
educated” elite, is completely in line with the deeper experience-based intuitive idea

of each of us that our mental intentional efforts often inﬂuence our physical actions.
That experience-based belief is the rational foundation of our meaningful creative
lives, and of the societies that we have created to house this intuitive idea of what
we are.
The “big” problems of: (1), the connection between mind and brain; (2), “free
will”; (3), faster-than-light action-at-a-distance; (4), apparent retrocausal actions;
and (5), a rational foundation for morality, have all been addressed in this book
within the Orthodox Quantum Mechanical conception of reality, upgraded by the
work of Tomonaga and Schwinger to the relativistic form provided by RQFT. That
orthodox theory accounts for, in addition to all the new data, also all of the suc-
cesses of the prior physical theory, classical mechanics, while eliminating its major
liabilities, which include: (1), its incompatibility with the ﬁndings of atomic phy-
sics; (2), its incompatibility with the faster-than-light aspect of nature proved in
Appendix 1; and (3), its incompatibility with a belief that is essential to the suc-
cessful living of our lives, namely the idea that how we physically act is not
completely determined either before we were born or by the prior physical reality
combined with pure random chance. The orthodox theory rationally explains how
our mental intentions, per se, can tend to make our physical actions conform to our
value-based mental intentions. That theory thus revokes the classical idea that we
are essentially mechanical cogs in a clock-like universe, lacking any capacity to
initiate, by mental effort, actions that can aid our survival, advance our values, or
improve the world for others.
The simplistic classical conception of reality has thus been converted by a major
advance in science to a radically revised image of the cosmos and our place within
it.
This
quantum
mechanical
conception
provides
a
rationally
coherent
science-based foundation for human lives suffused with purpose and meaning.
A person’s mind acts ﬁrst to construct, from the clues transmitted by sense organs
to that observer’s brain, a conception of the physically described reality in which
the person is locally embedded. The person’s mind then directs, in mentally
intended ways (via mental efforts that exploit the quantum dynamical laws), that
person’s
bodily
actions.
Quantum
mechanics
thereby
provides
a
rational
science-based escape from the philosophical, metaphysical, moral, and explanatory
dead ends that are the rational consequences of the prevailing entrenched and
stoutly defended in practice—although known to be basically false in principle—
classical materialistic conception of the world and our place within it.

Strengthening Bell’s Theorem by Removing the Hidden-Variable
Assumption
In the context of correlation experiments involving pairs of experiments performed
at essentially the same time in very far-apart experimental regions Einstein
famously said [22]:
But on one supposition we should in my opinion hold absolutely fast: ‘The real factual
situation of the system S2 is independent of what is done with system S1 which is spatially
separated from the former.’
This
demand
is
incompatible
with
the
basic
ideas
of
standard
(Copenhagen/Orthodox) quantum mechanics, which makes two relevant claims:
(1) Experimenters in the two labs make “local free choices” that determine which
experiments will be performed in their respective labs. These choices are
“free” in the sense of not being pre-determined by the prior history of the
physically described aspects of the universe, and they are “localized” in the
sense that the physical effects of these free choices are inserted into the
physically described aspects of the universe only within the laboratory, and
during the time interval, in which the associated experiment is being
performed.
(2) These choices of “what is done with the system” being measured in one lab
can (due to a measurement-induced global collapse of the quantum state)
inﬂuence the outcome of the experiment performed at very close to the same
time in the very faraway lab.
This inﬂuence of ‘what is done’ with the system being measured in one region
upon the outcome appearing at very nearly the same time in a very faraway lab was
called “spooky action at a distance” by Einstein, and was rejected by him as a
possible feature of “reality”.

John Bell’s Quasi-classical Statistical Theory
Responding to the seeming existence in the quantum world of “spooky actions”,
John Bell [23] proposed a possible alternative to the standard approach that might
conceivably be able to reconcile quantum spookiness with “reality”. This alterna-
tive approach rests on the fact that quantum mechanics is a statistical theory. We
already have in physics a statistical theory called “classical statistical mechanics”.
In that theory the statistical state of a system is expressed as a sum of terms, each of
which is a possible real physical state k of the system multiplied by a probability
factor.
Bell conjectured that quantum mechanics, being a statistical theory, might have
the same kind of structure. Such a structure would satisfy the desired properties of
“locality” and “reality” (local realism) if, for each real physical state k in this sum,
the relationships between the chosen measurements in the two regions and the
appearing outcomes are expressed as product of two factors, with each factor
depending upon the measurement and outcome in just one of the two regions. The
question is then whether the statistical properties of such a statistical ensemble can
be consistent with the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics.
Bell and his associates proved that the answer is No! They considered, for
example, the empirical situation that physicists describe by saying that two spin-1/2
particles are created in the so-called spin-singlet state, and then travel to the two
far-apart but nearly simultaneous experimental regions. The experimenter in each
region freely chooses and performs one of the two alternative possible experiments
available to him. Bell et. al. then prove that the predictions of quantum mechanics
cannot be satisﬁed if the base states k satisfy the “factorization property” demand of
“local realism”. A theory satisfying this demand is called a “local hidden-variable
theory” because the asserted underlying “reality” is described by variables that
cannot be directly apprehended.
Two Problems with Bell’s Theorems
Bell-type theorems, if considered as proofs of the logical need for spooky actions in
a theory that entails the predictions of quantum mechanics, have two problems. The
ﬁrst is that the theorems postulate a “reality” structure basically identical to that of
classical statistical mechanics. Bell’s theorems then show that imposing “locality”
(factorizability for each ﬁxed k) within this classical-type reality structure is
incompatible with some predictions of quantum mechanics. But that result can be
regarded as merely added conﬁrmation of the fact that quantum mechanics is
logically incompatible with the conceptual structure of classical mechanics. Simply
shifting to a classically conceived “statistical” level does not eliminate the essential
conceptual dependence on the known-to-be-false concepts of classical physics.
84
Appendix A: Proof that Information Must Sometimes …

The second problem is that the condition of “local realism” is implemented by a
“factorization” property, described above, that goes far beyond Einstein’s demand
for no spookiness. In addition to the non-dependence of outcomes in a region upon
“what is done” in the faraway region “local realism” entails also what Shimony
calls “outcome independence”. That condition goes signiﬁcantly beyond what
Einstein demanded, which is merely a non-dependence of the factual reality (oc-
curring outcome) in one region on the choice of experiment performed in the
faraway region. “Outcome independence” demands that the outcome in each region
be independent also of the outcome in the other region.
That property, “outcome independence”, is not something that one wants to
postulate if a resulting incompatibility with predictions of quantum mechanics is
supposed to entail the existence of spooky actions at a distance!
That unwanted independence assumption is not a just a minor ﬁne point.
Consider the simple example of two billiard balls, one black, one white, shot out in
opposite directions to two far-apart labs. This physical example allows—given the
initial symmetrical physical state—the outcome in one region to be correlated with
the “outcome” appearing in the other region, without any hint of any spooky action
at a distance”: a “black” ball in one region entails a “white” ball in the other, and
vice versa, without any spooky action. Hence Bell’s theorems do not address—or
claim to address—the key question of the compatibility of Einstein’s demand for no
spookiness with the predictions of (relativistic) quantum mechanics. Bell’s theo-
rems are based on the stronger assumption of local hidden variables.
Bell’s theorems (regarded as proofs of the need for spooky actions) are thus
deﬁcient in two ways: they bring in from classical (statistical) mechanics an
alien-to-quantum-mechanics idea of “reality”; and they assume, in the process of
proving a contradiction, a certain property of “outcome independence” that can lead
to a violation of quantum predictions without entailing the lack of spookiness that
Einstein demanded.
The question thus arises whether the need for spooky interactions can be proved
simply from the validity of some empirically well validated predictions of standard
quantum mechanics, without introducing Bell’s essentially classical “hidden vari-
ables”? The answer is “Yes”!
The Proof
The following proof of the need for “spooky actions” places no conditions at all on
any underlying process or reality, beyond the macroscopic predictions of quantum
mechanics: it deals exclusively with connections between macroscopic measurable
properties. This change is achieved by taking Bell’s parameter k to label, now, the
different experiments in a very large set of simultaneously performed similar
experiments, rather than the different possible basic microscopic states k of the
statistical ensembles. The ontology thereby becomes essentially different, though
Appendix A: Proof that Information Must Sometimes …
85

the mathematics is similar. The macroscopic experimental arrangements are the
ones already described above.
In the design of this experiment the physicists are imagining that a certain initial
macroscopic preparation procedure will produce a pair of tiny invisible (spin 1/2)
particles in what is called the singlet state. These two particles are imagined to ﬂy
out in opposite directions to two faraway experimental regions. Each of these
experimental regions contains a Stern-Gerlach device that has a directed preferred
axis that is perpendicular to the incoming beam. Two detection devices are placed
to detect particles deﬂected either along this preferred axis, or in the opposite
direction. Each of these two devices will produce a visible signal (or an auditory
click) if the imagined invisible particle reaches it.
The location of the individual detector is speciﬁed by the angle / of the directed
preferred axis such that a displacement along that particular direction locates the
detector. Clearly, the two detectors in the same experimental region will then be
speciﬁed by two angles / that differ by 180°. For example, if one detector is
displaced “up” (/ = 90°) then the other is displaced “down” (/ = −90°). The angle
/ = 0 labels in both regions a common deﬂection to the right: e.g., along the
positive x axis in the usual x-y plane.
Under these macroscopic experimental conditions, quantum theory predicts that,
if the detectors are 100% efﬁcient, and if, moreover, the geometry is perfectly
arranged, then for each created pair of particles—which are moving in opposite
directions to the two different regions—exactly one of the two detectors in each
region will produce a signal (i.e., “ﬁre”). The key prediction of quantum theory for
this experimental setup is that the fraction F of the particle pairs for which the
detectors that ﬁre in the ﬁrst and second regions are located at angles /1 and /2,
respectively, is given by the formula
F ¼ 1  Cosine /1  /2
ð
Þ
ð
Þ=4:
In the experiment under consideration there are two alternative possible exper-
iments in the left-hand lab, and two alternative possible experiments in the
right-hand lab, making 2  2 = 4 alternative possible pairs of experiments. For
each single experiment (on one side) there are two detectors, and hence two angles
/. Thus there are altogether 4  2  2 = 16 F’s.
I take the large set of similar experiment to have 1000 experiments. Then the
fractions F of 1000 are entered into the 16 associated boxes of the following
diagram.
In Fig. A1, the ﬁrst and second rows correspond to the two detectors in the ﬁrst
possible set-up in the left-hand region. The third and fourth rows correspond to the
two detectors in the second possible set-up in the left-hand region. The four col-
umns correspond in the analogous way to the detectors in the right-hand region. The
arrows on the periphery show the directions of the displacements of the detectors
associated with the corresponding row or column.
For example, in the top-left 2-by-2 box if the locations of the two detectors (one
in each region) that ﬁre together are both speciﬁed by the same angle, /1 = /2,
86
Appendix A: Proof that Information Must Sometimes …

then, because Cosine 0 = 1, each speciﬁed pair of detectors will never both ﬁre
together: if one of these two speciﬁed detectors ﬁres, then the other will not ﬁre. If
/1 is some ﬁxed angle and /2 differs from it by 180° then, because Cosine
180° = −1, these two speciﬁed detectors will, under the ideal measurement con-
ditions, ﬁre together for half of the created pairs. If /1 is some ﬁxed angle and /2
differs from it by 90° then these two speciﬁed detectors will ﬁre together for 1=4 of
the pairs. If /1 is some ﬁxed angle and /2 differs from it by 45° then these two
speciﬁed detectors will ﬁre together, in a long run, for close to 7.3% of the pairs. If
/1 is some ﬁxed angle and /2 differs from it by 135° then these two speciﬁed
detectors will ﬁre together, in a long run, for close to 42.7% of the created pairs.
I have listed these particular predictions because they are assumed to be valid in
the following proof of the need for near-instantaneous transfer of information
between the two far-apart, but nearly simultaneous, experimental space-time
regions. These particular predictions have been massively conﬁrmed empirically.
The second assumption is “localized free choices”. The point here is that
physical theories make predictions about experiments performed by experimenters
with devices that detect or measure properties of the systems whose properties are
being probed by these devices. The theory entails that the various settings of the
devices will correspond to probe-associated properties of the system being probed.

Of course, in an actual situation these speciﬁed parts of the experimental setup
are all parts of a universe that includes also the experimenter and whatever the
experimenter uses to actually ﬁx the experimental settings. Such a “choosing” part
of the universe could, however, conceivably causally affect not only to the setting of
the associated measuring device but, say, via the distant past, also other aspects of
the experiment. Those unsuspected linkages via the past could then be responsible
for systematic correlations between the empirical conditions in the two regions—
correlations that are empirically dependent on which experiments are chosen and
performed but are empirically independent of how the experimental setups are
chosen.
In view of the limitless number of ways one could arrange to have the experi-
mental setup speciﬁed, and the empirically veriﬁed fact that the predictions are
found to be valid independently of how the setup is chosen, it is reasonable to
assume that the choices of the experimental setups can be arranged so that they are
not systematically connected to the speciﬁed empirical aspects of the experiment
except via these choices of the experimental setup. This is the assumption of
“localized free choices.” It is needed to rule out the (remote) possibility that the
choice of the setup is signiﬁcantly and systematically entering the dynamics in
some way other than as just the localized ﬁxing of the experimental setup.
Suppose, then, that we have the two far-apart experimental regions, and in each
region an experimenter who can freely choose one or the other of two alternative
possible experimental set-ups. Suppose we have, in a certain region called the
source region, a certain mechanical procedure to which we give the name “creation
of N individual experimental instances, where N is a large number, say a thousand.
At an appropriate later time the experimenters in the two regions make and
implement their “localized free choices” pertaining to which of the two alternative
possible experiments will be set up in their respective experimental regions. At a
slightly later time each of the two experimenters looks at and sees, in each of the N
individual instances, which one of his two detection devices has ﬁred, and then
records the angle / that labels that detector, thereby recording the outcome that
occurs in that individual instance.
There are altogether two times two, or four, alternative possible experimental
setups. Figure A1 gives, for each of these four alternative possible setups, the
number of individual instances, from the full set of 1000, that produce ﬁrings in the
pair of detectors located at the pair of angles / speciﬁed along the left-hand and top
boundaries of the full diagram. For example, the four little boxes in the ﬁrst two
rows and the ﬁrst two columns correspond to the case in which the experimenter in
the left-hand region sets his two detectors at “up” (/1 = 90°) and “down”
(/1 = −90°), while the experimenter in the right-hand region sets his two detectors
also at “up” (/2 = 90°) and “down” (/2 = −90°). In this case the expected dis-
tribution (modulo ﬂuctuations) of the thousand instances is 500 in the box in which
/1 = 90° and /2 = −90° and the other 500 in the box in which /1 = −90° and
/2 = 90°.
88
Appendix A: Proof that Information Must Sometimes …

The ﬂuctuations become relatively smaller and smaller as N get larger and larger.
So I will, for simplicity, ignore them in this discussion and treat the predictions to
be exact already for N = 1000.
The two experimental regions are arranged to be essentially simultaneous, very
far apart, and very tiny relative to their separation. These two regions will be called
the “left” and “right” regions.
The “no-essentially-instantaneous-transfer of information about localized free
choices” assumption made here is that, no matter which experiment is performed in
a region, the outcome appearing there is independent of which experiment is freely
chosen and performed in the faraway region. This means, for example, that if the
experiment on the right is changed from the case represented by the left-hand two
columns to the case represented by the right-hand two columns, then the particular
set of 500 instances—from the full set of 1000—that are represented by the 500 in
the top row second column get shifted into the two boxes of the top row in the
second two columns.
More generally, a change in the experiment performed on the right shifts the
individual instances—in the set of 1000 individual instanced—horizontally, in the
same row; whereas a change in the experiment performed on the left shifts the
individual instance vertically. The Fig. A1 then shows how, by a double application
of the “no FTL condition”, a subset of the set of 500 instances occupying box A
gets shifted via box B to box C, which must then contain at least 427 −73 = 354 of
the original 500 instances in A. However, the applying of the two changes in the
other order, via D, demands that the subset of instances in A that can be in C can be
no greater than 250. That is a contradiction. Thus one cannot maintain simulta-
neously both the general rule of no FTL transfers of information and four very basic
and empirically conﬁrmed predictions of quantum mechanics.
In more detail the argument then goes as follows. Let the pairs (individual
instances) in the ordered sequence of the 1000 created pairs be numbered from 1 to
1000. Suppose that the actually chosen pair of measurements corresponds to the
ﬁrst two rows and the ﬁrst two columns in the diagram. This is the experiment in
which, in each region, the displacements of the two detectors are “up” and “down”.
Under this condition, quantum theory predicts that for some particular 500-member
subset of the full set of 1000 individual instances (created pairs) the outcomes
conform to the speciﬁcations associated with the little box labeled A. The corre-
sponding 500 member subset of the full set of 1000 positive integers is called Set A.
This Set A is a particular subset of 500 integers from set {1, 2, …,1000}. The ﬁrst 4
elements in Set A might be, for example, {1, 3, 4, 7}.
If the local free choice in the right-hand region had gone the other way, then the
prediction of quantum mechanics is that the thousand integers would be distributed
in the indicated way among the four little boxes that lie in one of the ﬁrst two rows
and also in one of the second two columns, with the integer in each of these four
little boxes specifying the number of instances in the subset of the original set of
1000 individual instances that lead to that speciﬁed outcome. Each such outcome
consists, of course, of a pair of outcomes, one in the left-hand experimental region,
Appendix A: Proof that Information Must Sometimes …
89

and speciﬁed by the row, the other in the right-hand experimental region and
speciﬁed by the column.
If we now add the Locality Condition, then the demand that the macroscopic
situation in the left-hand region be undisturbed by the reversal of the localized free
choice made by the experimenter in the (faraway) right-hand region means that the
set of 500 integers in Set A must be distributed between the two little boxes
standing directly to the right of the little box A. Thus the Set B, consisting of the
427 integers in box B, would be a 427 member subset of the 500 integers in Set A.
The above conclusions were based on the supposition that the actual choice of
experiment on the left was the option, represented by the top two rows and the
leftmost two columns in Fig. A1. However, having changed the choice in the
right-hand region to the one that is represented by the rightmost two columns—the
possibility of which is which is entailed by Einstein’s reference to a dependence on
“what is done with” the faraway system—we next apply the locality hypothesis to
conclude that changing the choice on the left must leave the outcomes on the right
undisturbed. That means changing the top two rows to the bottom two rows, leaving
the integers that label the particular experiment in the set of 1000 experiments in the
same column. This means that the 427 elements in the box B must get distributed
among the two boxes that lie directly beneath it. Thus box C must include at least
427 −73 = 354 of the 500 integers in Set A.
Repeating the argument, but reversing the order in which the two reversals are
made, we conclude, from exactly the same line of reasoning, that box C can contain
no more than 250 of the 500 integers box A, Thus the conditions on Set C that arise
from the two different possible orderings of the two reversals are contradictory!
A contradiction is thus established between the consequences of the two alter-
native possible ways of ordering these two reversals of localized free choices.
Because, due to the locality hypothesis being examined, no information about the
choice made in either region is present in the other region, no information per-
taining to the order in which the two experiments are performed is available in
either region. Hence nothing pertaining to outcomes can depend upon the relative
ordering of these two space-like separated reversals of the two choices.
This argument uses only macroscopic predictions of quantum mechanics—
without any conditions on, or mention of, any micro-structure from whence these
macroscopic properties come—to demonstrate the logical inconsistency of com-
bining a certain 16 (empirically validated) predictions of quantum mechanics with
the locality hypothesis that for each of the two experimental regions there is no
faster-than-light transfer to the second region of information about macroscopically
localized free choices made in the ﬁrst.
The Bell’s theorem proofs are rightly identiﬁed as proofs of the incompatibility
of “local realism” with the predictions of quantum mechanics. But “local realism”
brings in both alien-to-quantum-theory classical concepts and also an “outcome
independence” condition whose inclusion nulliﬁes those theorems as possible
proofs of the need for spooky actions at a distance. Both of these features are
avoided in the present proof.

Appendix A: Proof that Information Must Sometimes …

As regards Einstein’s reality condition, namely that the no-spooky-action con-
dition pertains to the “real factual situation” one must, of course, use the quantum
conception of the “real factual situation”, not an invalid classical concept. In
ontologically construed orthodox quantum mechanics (in the contemporary rela-
tivistic quantum ﬁeld theory version that I use) the “real factual situation” evolves
in a way that depends upon the experimenter’s free choices and nature’s responses
to those choices. The no-spooky-action condition is a condition on these
choice-dependent real factual situations—namely outcomes observed under the
chosen conditions—that is inconsistent with certain basic predictions of the theory.
That is what has just been proved. In classical mechanics there are no analogous
free choices: the physical past alone uniquely determines the physical present and
future.
The Einstein idea of no spooky actions involves comparing two or more situ-
ations only one of which can actually occur. This is the kind of condition that
occurs in modal logic considerations involving “counterfactuals”. But here this
modal aspect does not bring in any of the subtleties or uncertainties that plague
general modal logic. For in our case the speciﬁed condition is a completely well
deﬁned and unambiguous (trial) mathematical assumption of the non-dependence
of a nearby outcome upon a faraway free choice between two alternative possible
probing actions. The proof does not get entangled with the subtle issues that arise in
general modal logic. Everything is just as well deﬁned as in ordinary logic.
In this proof there is no assumption of a “hidden variable” of an essentially
classical kind lying “behind” the ontologically construed orthodox quantum theory.
The phenomena are rationally understandable in terms of an evolving quantum state
of the universe that represents “potentialities for experiences” that evolve via a
Schrödinger-like equation punctuated by an ordered sequence of psycho-physical
events each of which is an observer’s personal experience accompanied by a
“collapse of the quantum state of the universe” that brings that evolving state into
conformity with the observer-initiated experience of that observer.
The bottom line is that, given the validity of some basic macroscopic predictions
of quantum mechanics, there is no way that the macroscopic phenomena can
conform to the predictions of quantum mechanics without allowing violations of the
general notion that the information about the local free choices cannot get essen-
tially instantaneously to faraway regions and affect outcomes appearing in those
regions.

Appendix B
Graphical Representation of the Argument
The argument in Appendix A was expressed in words and equations. For many
purposes it is useful, for arguments involving an ordered sequence free choices or
decisions, to have a graphical representation of the alternative possibilities
The argument in Appendix A is based on statements of the form:
If measurement M is performed and the outcome is O, then if, instead of M, the measure M’
were to be performed, then the outcome would be O’.
Statements of this kind make sense in classical physics. An outcome O of M
could, within some theoretical framework, give some information about the state of
the world before the measurement M was performed, and this information could
entail that O’ would occur if M’ were to be performed. For example, the outcome of
the ﬁrst experiment could give information about the previously unknown or
unspeciﬁed velocity of a particle entering the experimental region, and this added
information could allow the outcome O’ of M’ to be predicted. The connection
between the two alternative possible situations is a consequence of the conjectured
structure of the reality lying behind the observable phenomena. It is therefore a
condition on the real existence of that conjectured structure.
The argument in Appendix A involves only macroscopic choices of measure-
ments and outcomes, and a conjectured no-faster-than-light condition. These things
are all classically understandable, and the argument can be represented graphically.
Statements of this kind can be deﬁnitely true or deﬁnitely false in the context of a
physical theory that has logically consistent laws that allow the “free choices”
between which of several alternative possible experiments is performed to be
treated as free variables. Copenhagen and orthodox quantum mechanics are theories
of this kind.
Logical reasoning is aided by having a “mechanical” way of checking the truth
or falsity of statements. Then all competent users of the logic can agree on the truth
or falsity of the propositions.
Robert Grifﬁths [13] has invented such a “mechanical” procedure for validating
reasoning of this kind. It is a graphical procedure. It involves a tree graph that,
reading from left to right, has branches that “branch” at branch points into more
branches. Some branch points represent the occurrence of events where a choice
must be made between two (or more) alternative possible experiments. Other

branch points represent events where some particular outcome of some particular
experiment must be chosen (by nature).
If, as in our case, there are two far-apart experimental regions, then the full
graphical part that represents the possible events in the later region must be hooked
onto each of the branches representing an outcome in the ﬁrst region, in order for
the graph, reading from left to right, to represent, without prejudice stemming from
the no-faster-than-light conjecture at issue, the temporal order of the macroscopic
events.
Grifﬁths allows graphs that include branch points corresponding to microscopic
(invisible) events, but I exclude all such points and consider only visible events. For
the argument in Appendix A explicitly precludes all reference to such imagined
events.
Figures B1 and B2 give the graphical representations of the two parts of the
argument in Appendix A. The part of the graph that corresponds to the part of the

which the reversal R1 to R2 in region R precedes the reversal L1 to L2 in region L

process labeled L (for left-hand region) stands to the left of the parts labeled R (for
right-hand region). The left-to-right ordering in the graph corresponds to increasing
time. Thus the L part of the physical process is earlier than the R part.
The argument in Appendix A involves two different orderings of the reversals.
So one might consider a second graph with the L-R ordering reversed. But a key
requirement of Grifﬁths’ formalism is that a valid argument must be expressed by
using only one single graph. So, within Grifﬁths’ theory, the reasoning in
Appendix A must be justiﬁed by using only one single graph. Consequently, the
two parts of the argument must use the same graph. The superposed thinner lines in
the two diagrams represent the propositions in the two parts of the argument.
Figure B1 represents the case in which the reversal from experiment R1 to
experiment R2 comes ﬁrst. Keeping track of the 500 elements of Set A under this
reversal, which leaves everything in region L unchanged, we see that 427 of the 500
elements a Set A go to Set B. Next comes the reversal L1 to L2 in region L, with the
Fig. B2 The Grifﬁths Diagram Corresponding to the part of the argument given in Appendix A in
which the reversal L1 to L2 in region L precedes the reversal R1 to R2 in region R
Appendix B: Graphical Representation of the Argument
95

experimenter’s choice of R2 in region R left unchanged. We are interested in how
many of the 500 elements in set A end up in set C, which corresponds to L2+.
These must come from the 427 elements in set B. Because at most 73 of these 427
elements can go to R2+, at least 427 −73 = 354 must end up in set C. This is just a
diagrammatic representation in the pertinent Grifﬁths graph of the ﬁrst half of the
argument given in Appendix A.
Figure B2 represents the second half of the argument given in Appendix A, the
part in which the ﬁrst reversal is the reversal of L1 to L2 with the choice in region R
of R1 held ﬁxed. Starting again with the 500 elements in set A, but now tracing ﬁrst
back to the experimenter’s choice between L1 and L2, and then forward along the
other branch, L2, and following the L2+ branch that leads to branch D. Only 250 0f
the original 500 instances in Set A end up in D. Then the reversal of R1 to R2
keeping the choice in region L of L2 unchanged allows at most 250 of the elements
in Set A to be in Set C. This conclusion conﬂicts with the conclusion associated
with Fig. B1, which was that at least 354 elements of set A are contained in set C.
Thus the conclusion deduced in Appendix A by using the common-sense under-
standings of the meanings of the words is conﬁrmed within Grifﬁths’ graphical
representation of the structure of counterfactual reasoning, restricted now to visible
macroscopic events.
A variation of this argument based on experiments of the kind proposed by
Julian Hardy has been described in [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The argument given
above is the one given earlier in [18], here spelled out in greater detail.

Reply to Sam Harris on Free Will
Sam Harris’s book “Free Will” is an instructive example of how a spokesman
dedicated to being reasonable and rational can have his arguments derailed by a
reliance on prejudices and false presuppositions so deep-seated that they block
seeing science-based possibilities that lie outside the conﬁnes of an outmoded world
view that is now known to be incompatible with the empirical facts.
A particular logical error appears repeatedly throughout Harris’s book. Early on,
he describes the deeds of two psychopaths who have committed some horrible acts.
He asserts: “I have to admit that if I were to trade places with one of these men,
atom for atom, I would be him: There is no extra part of me that could decide to see
the world differently or to resist the impulse to victimize other people.”
Harris asserts, here, that there is “no extra part of me” that could decide dif-
ferently. But that assertion, which he calls an admission, begs the question. What
evidence rationally justiﬁes that claim? Clearly it is not empirical evidence. It is,
rather, a prejudicial and anti-scientiﬁc commitment to the precepts of a
known-to-be-false conception of the world called classical mechanics. That older
scientiﬁc understanding of reality was found during the ﬁrst decades of the twen-
tieth century to be incompatible with empirical ﬁndings, and was replaced during
the 1920s, and early 1930s, by an adequate and successful revised understanding
called quantum mechanics. This newer theory, in the rationally coherent and
mathematically rigorous formulation offered by John von Neumann, features a
separation of the world process into (1), a physically described part composed of
atoms and closely connected physical ﬁelds; (2), some psychologically described
parts lying outside the atom-based part, and identiﬁed as our thinking ego’s; and
(3), some psycho-physical actions attributed to nature. Within this empirically
adequate conception of reality there is an extra (non-atom-based) part of a person
(his thinking ego) that can resist (successfully, if willed with sufﬁcient intensity) the
impulse to victimize other people. Harris’s example thus illustrates the fundamental
errors that can be caused by identifying honored science with nineteenth century
classical mechanics.
Harris goes on to defend “compatibilism”, the view that claims both that every
physical event is determined by what came before in the physical world and also
that we possess “free will”. Harris says that “Today the only philosophically

DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-58301-3
97

respectable way to endorse free will is to be a compatibilist—because we know that
determinism, in every sense relevant to human behavior, is true”.
But what Harris claims that “We know” to be true is, according to quantum
mechanics, not known to be true.
The ﬁnal clause “in every sense relevant to human behavior” is presumably
meant to discount the relevance of quantum mechanical indeterminism, by asserting
that quantum indeterminism is not relevant to human behavior—presumably
because it washes out at the level of macroscopic brain dynamics But that idea of
what the shift to quantum mechanics achieves is grossly deﬁcient. The quantum
indeterminism merely opens the door to a complex dynamical process that not only
violates determinism (the condition that the physical past determines the future) at
the level of human behavior, but allows mental intentions that are not controlled by
the physical past to inﬂuence human behavior in the intended way. Thus the shift to
quantum mechanics opens the door to a causal efﬁcacy of free will that is ruled out
by Harris’s effective embrace of false nineteenth science.

The Paranormal and the Principle
of Sufﬁcient Reason
This book has been an exposition of what I call “Realistically construed orthodox
quantum mechanics”. That name is intended to mean the conception of reality most
naturally concordant with the “pragmatic” interpretation offered by the founders
(Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Born, Dirac, Bohr, and Pauli), as mathematically for-
mulated by John von Neumann and subsequently converted during the late 1940s
(principally
by
Tomonaga,
Schwinger,
and
Feynman)
into
contemporary
Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, RQFT.
It might be objected that this orthodox theory is deﬁcient because it does not
encompass the widely reported paranormal phenomena. On the other hand, many
scientists believe that those phenomena, which, by deﬁnition, are incompatible with
the generally accepted contemporary physical theory, ought not be considered to be
“science” because, by and large, the papers reporting them have not been published
in the most prestigious scientiﬁc journals, ostensibly because of defects in their
methods and procedures.
One exception to that publication criterion is a recent (2012) paper in the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology by Cornell psychologist Daryl J. Bem. However, I
show in this appendix how Bem’s data, which appears to require backward-in-time
(retro-causal) effects forbidden by the strictly orthodox RQFT can be explained
without any actual backward-in-time action by passing from this “strictly orthodox”
theory to a modiﬁed “quasi-orthodox” version which, unlike the orthodox theory,
enforces “The principle of sufﬁcient reason”. This principle asserts that every deﬁnite
happening must have some deﬁnite reason to be what it is, rather than something else.
This principle seems, from a general scientiﬁc point of view, to be rational and
reasonable: it bans the possibility that a deﬁnite value of a physical property can just
suddenly “pop out of the blue”, which is what the strictly orthodox theory effectively
demands when it speciﬁes that nature makes strictly random yet perfectly deﬁnite
choices. The reasonable question is: “What principle or process separates this chosen
value from the un-chosen ones, in the (assumed to be single) observed universe?”
It turns out that Bem’s data can be accommodated by replacing the
“strictly-orthodox” theory by a “quasi orthodox” theory that upholds the principle
of sufﬁcient reason. In the quasi-orthodox theory nature’s choices are not random,
hence lacking a sufﬁcient reason to be what they are, but are assumed to have

sufﬁcient reasons that entail a biasing of nature’s choices in favor of choices that
advance the personal values of the subjects in these experiments who are posing the
questions pertaining to matters of interest to themselves.
In the Bem experiment these pertinent choices occur at the very end of the
experimental instance, and hence later in time than another “independent” choice
made by the subject-observer at the beginning of the experimental instance.
However, a biasing of the later choice biases records of the past, due to the
difference between the actual and effective past discussed in Chap. 7. Thus, on the
basis of the recorded data that survive the collapses, the experimenter will conclude
that the earlier choice was biased. That is because the records that survive the ﬁnal
collapse will not include the records residing in the branch of reality that was
created at the moment the device made the macroscopic random choice of which
picture to present to the subject, but that nature later (biasly) chose not to actualize.
To explain this possibility in more detail, I include (intact) in this appendix a
paper that I prepared in 2012 but never submitted to a journal. It shows that the
retro-causal actions seemingly found by Bem can be avoided by replacing the
“irrational” strictly orthodox dependence of nature’s choice of response to the
subject’s probing actions upon “pure chance” by a meaningful choice that depends
on values residing in that person’s “ego”. That biasing of the statistical weight of a
choice made by nature at the tail end of the experimental instance effectively biases,
via the quantum collapse, the weighting of the “effective” past that precedes that
collapse without there being any actual backward-in-time action.
Quasi-Orthodox Quantum Mechanics and the Principle
of Sufﬁcient Reason
Abstract The principle of sufﬁcient reason asserts that anything that happens does so
for a reason: no deﬁnite state of affairs can come into being unless there is a sufﬁcient
reason why that particular thing should happen instead of something else. This principle
is usually attributed to Leibniz, although the ﬁrst recorded Western Philosopher to use it
was Anaximander of Miletus. The demand that nature be rational, in the sense that it be
compatible with the principle of sufﬁcient reason, conﬂicts with a basic feature of
contemporary orthodox physical theory, namely the notion that nature’s responses to the
probing actions of observers be determined by pure chance, and hence on the basis of
absolutely no reason at all. This injection of “irrational” pure chance can be deemed to
have no fundamental place in reason-based Western science, and it has been criticized by
Einstein, among others. It is argued here that in a world that conforms to the principle of
sufﬁcient reason, the usual quantum statistical rules will naturally emerge at the prag-
matic level, in cases where the reason behind Nature’s choice of response is unknown,
but that the usual statistics can become biased in an empirically manifest and apparently
retrocausal way when the reason for the choice is empirically identiﬁable. It is shown
here that some recently reported high proﬁle experimental results that violate the prin-
ciples of contemporary physical theory can be rationally and simply explained if nature’s
supposedly random choices are sometimes slightly biased in a way that depends upon
the emotional valence of the observer-experiences that these choices create.

Introduction
An article recently published by the Cornell psychologist Daryl J. Bem [24] in a
distinguished psychology journal has provoked a heated discussion in the New
York Times [25]. Among the discussants was Douglas Hofstadter who wrote that:
“If any of his claims were true, then all of the bases underlying contemporary
science would be toppled, and we would have to rethink everything about the
nature of the universe.”
It is, I believe, an exaggeration to say that if any of Bem’s claims were true then
“all of the bases underlying contemporary science would be toppled” and that “we
would have to rethink everything about the nature of the universe”. In fact, all that
is required is a relatively small change in the rules, and one that seems even more
reasonable and natural than the usual rules, within the broad general framework of
rational Western science. The major part of the required rethinking was done
already by the founders of quantum mechanics, and cast in more rigorous form by
John von Neumann [26], more than seventy years ago.
According to the ordinary precepts of classical mechanics, once the physically
described universe is created, it evolves continuously in a deterministic manner that
is completely ﬁxed by mathematical laws that depend always and everywhere only
on the evolving local values of physically described properties. There are no inputs
into the dynamics that go beyond what is speciﬁed by those physically described
properties. Here physically described properties are properties that are speciﬁed by
assigning mathematical properties to space-time points, or to very tiny regions,
independently of whether they are presently being experienced by any biological or
other experiencing entity. These properties are thereby distinguished from prop-
erties that are described directly in terms of actually experienced thoughts, ideas, or
feelings. Within that classical mechanical framework of physics the increasing
experienced knowledge of human beings and other biological agents enters only as
an output of the physically described evolution of the universe: experiential aspects
of reality that go beyond the purely physical aspects play no role in the algorith-
mically determined mechanistic evolution of the universe, except perhaps at its
birth.
This
one-way
causation
from
the
physical
aspects
of
nature
to
the
empirical/epistemological/mental aspects has always been puzzling: Why should
experienced “knowledge” exist at all if it cannot inﬂuence anything physical, and
hence be of no use to the organisms that possess it. And how can something like an
“idea”, seemingly so different from physical matter, as matter is conceived of in
classical mechanics, be created by, or simply be, the motion of physical matter?
The basic precepts of classical mechanics are now known to be fundamentally
incorrect: they cannot be reconciled with a plenitude of empirical facts discovered
and veriﬁed during the twentieth century. Thus there is no reason to demand, or
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason
101

believe, that those puzzling properties of the classically conceived world must carry
over to the actual world, which conforms far better to the radically different precepts
of quantum mechanics.
The founders of quantum theory conceived their theory to be a mathematical
procedure for making practical predictions about future empirical/experiential
ﬁndings on the basis of present empirical knowledge. According to this idea,
quantum theory is basically about the evolution of knowledge. This profound shift
is proclaimed by Heisenberg’s assertion [27] that the quantum mathematics “rep-
resents no longer the behavior of the elementary particles but rather our knowledge
of this behavior”, and by Bohr’s statement [28] that “Strictly speaking, the math-
ematical formalism of quantum mechanics merely offers rules of calculation for the
deduction of expectations about observations obtained under conditions deﬁned by
classical physics concepts.”
The essential need to bring “observations” into the theoretical structure arises
from the fact that physical evolution via the Schrödinger equation, which is the
quantum analog of the classical equations of motion, produces in general not a
single evolving physical world that is compatible with human experience and
observations, but rather a mathematical structure that corresponds to a smeared out
mixture of increasingly many such worlds. Consequently, some additional process,
beyond the one generated by the Schrödinger equation, is needed to specify the
connection is between the physically described quantum state of the universe and
experienced empirical reality.
This important connectivity is alien to the concepts of classical physics. Those
concepts arose from—or were at least heavily reinforced by—the conceptual
miniaturization of the celestial objects of astronomy and the solid terrestrial objects
of normal observation. In those two regimes we, the observers, stand effectively
apart from the system being observed and—under the conditions of the applicability
of that classical physical theory—have no appreciable inﬂuence upon the behavior
of the observed system. The classical concept of “the physical system” was thereby
divorced from the concept of “being observed”.
This classical separability the physical from the mental is not altered by
miniaturization. However, there is no rational reason why this separability feature
of the classical conceptualization of the physical world should continue to be useful
or applicable when the brains of we the observers become included in what is being
described physically. But how does scientiﬁc theory advance in a well-deﬁned and
useful way beyond the classical notion of mind-brain disjunction? How can science
bring these two disparate kinds of descriptions together in a rationally coherent
manner?
The founders of quantum mechanics achieved a profound advance in our
understanding of nature when they recognized that the mathematically/physically
described universe that appears in our best physical theory represents not the world
of material substance contemplated in the classical physics of Isaac Newton and his
102
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason

direct successors, but rather a world of “potentia”, or “weighted possibilities”, for
our future acquisitions of knowledge [29]. It is not surprising that an adequate
scientiﬁc theory designed to allow us to predict correlations between our shared
empirical ﬁndings should incorporate, as orthodox quantum mechanics does: (1), a
natural place for “our knowledge”, which is both all that is really known to us, and
also the empirical foundation upon which science is based; (2), an account of the
process by means of which we acquire our knowledge of certain physically
described aspects of nature; and (3), a statistical description, at the pragmatic level,
of relationships between various features of the growing aspect of nature that
constitutes “our knowledge”.
What is perhaps surprising is the ready acceptance by most western-oriented
scientists and philosophers of the notion that the element of chance that enters quite
reasonably into the pragmatic formulation of physical theory, in a practical context
where many pertinent things may be unknown to us, stems from an occurrence of
raw pure chance at the underlying ontological level. Ascribing such capriciousness
to the underlying basic reality itself would seem to contradict the rationalist ideals
of Western Science. From a strictly rational point of view, it is, therefore, not
unreasonable to examine the mathematical impact of tentatively accepting, at the
basic ontological level, Einstein’s dictum that: “God does not play dice with the
universe”, and thus to attribute the effective entry of pure chance at the practical
level to our lack of knowledge of the reasons for the supposedly random choices
that enter into the quantum dynamics to be what they turn out to be.
These supposedly random choices enter quantum mechanics only through cer-
tain “choices on the part of nature”. These choices determine which of the poten-
tialities generated by the mechanistic Schrödinger equation are actualized and
experienced. The tentative assumption, here, is that the seeming randomness of
these choices arises from the incompleteness of our knowledge of the conditions
that determine what these choices will be, but that sufﬁcient reasons for these
choices do exist, and a proper task of science is to ﬁnd out what some of these
reasons are.
Implementing the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason
I make no judgment regarding the technical correctness of the purported evidence
for the existence of the reported retrocausal phenomena. That I leave to the col-
lective eventual wisdom of the scientiﬁc community. I am concerned here rather
with essentially logical and mathematical issues, as they relate to the apparent view
of some commentators that scholarly articles reporting the existence of retrocausal
phenomena should be banned from the scientiﬁc literature, essentially for the reason
articulated in the New York Times by Douglas Hofstadter, namely that the actual
existence of such phenomena is irreconcilable with what we now (think we) know
about the structure of the universe. But is it actually true that the existence of such
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason
103

phenomena would require a wholesale abandonment of basic ideas of contemporary
physics.
That assessment is certainly not valid, as will be shown here. A limited, and
intrinsically reasonable, modiﬁcation of the existing orthodox quantum mechanics
is sufﬁcient to accommodate the reported data. Hence banning the publication of
such works would block a possible important advancement in science that would
constitute an empirically small but conceptually important correction to contem-
porary mainstream science. The issue in question is the validity of Einstein’s
opinion that the randomness invoked by orthodox quantum mechanics is not a
fundamental feature of reality itself.
In order for science to be able to confront effectively purported phenomena that
violate the prevailing basic theory, what is needed, or at least helpful, is an alter-
native theory that retains the empirically valid predictions of the currently pre-
vailing theory, yet accommodates in a rationally coherent way the claimed new
phenomena.
If the example of the transition from classical physics to quantum physics can
serve as an illustration, in that case we had a beautiful theory that had worked well
for 200 years, but that was incompatible with the new data made available by
advances in technology. However, a new theory was devised that was closely
connected to the old one, and that allowed us to recapture the old results in the
appropriate special cases, where the effects of the nonzero value of Planck’s con-
stant could be ignored. The old formalism was by-and-large retained, but readjusted
to accommodate the fact that properties that according to ordinary classical ideas
were described by numbers that speciﬁed the actual numerical values of the
properties, were represented at a more basic level by actions, which were related to
the measurement processes by means of which the numerical values were empir-
ically ascertained. Thus the active process by means of which we ﬁnd out about
certain pertinent numbers was brought explicitly into the dynamical theory. This
restructuring that brings into the heart of the theory our actions of performing the
measurements that produced the increments in our knowledge that constituted our
empirical ﬁndings is closely tied to a rejection of a basic classical presupposition,
namely the idea that basic physical theory should properly be primarily about
connections between physically described material events, with experiential rami-
ﬁcations an inessential addendum. The founders of quantum theory insisted, in
direct contrast, that their more basic physical theory was essentially pragmatic—
i.e., was directed at predicting practically useful connections between empirical
(i.e., experienced) events [30].
This original pragmatic Copenhagen QM was not suited to be an ontological
theory, because of the movable boundary between the aspects of nature described in
classical physical terms and those described in quantum physical terms. It is cer-
tainly not ontologically realistic to believe that the pointers on observed measuring
devices are built out of classically conceivable electrons and atoms, etc. The
measuring devices, and also the bodies and brains of human observers, must be
understood to be built out of quantum mechanically described elements. This is
what allows us to understand and describe many observed properties of these
104
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason

physically described systems, such as their rigidity and electrical conductance. The
aspects of quantum mechanics that describe our observations is more accurately
called a description of the experiential aspects, which can make use of classical
concepts as aids to our descriptions of our experiences.
Von Neumann’s analysis of the measurement problem allowed the quantum
state of the universe to describe the entire physically described universe: everything
that we naturally conceive to be built out of atomic constituents and the ﬁelds that
they generate. This quantum state is described by assigning mathematical properties
to space-time points (or tiny regions). There is a deterministic law, the Schrödinger
equation, that speciﬁes the mindless, essentially mechanical, evolution of this
quantum state. But this quantum mechanical law of motion generates a huge
continuous smear of worlds of the kind that we actually experience. For example, as
Einstein emphasized, the position of the pointer on a device that is supposed to tell
us the time of the detection of a particle produced by the decay of a radioactive
nucleus, evolves, under the control of the Schrödinger equation, into a continuous
smear of positions corresponding to all the different possible times of detection; not
to a single position, which is what we observe [31]. And the unrestricted validity of
the Schrödinger equation would lead, as also emphasized by Einstein, to the con-
clusion that the moon, as it is represented in the theory, would be smeared out over
the entire night sky, until the ﬁrst observer of it, say a mouse, looks.
How do we understand this huge disparity between the representation of the
universe evolving in accordance with the Schrödinger equation and the empirical
reality that we experience?
An adequate physical theory must include a logically coherent explanation of
how the mathematical/physical description is connected to the experienced
empirical realities. This demands, in the ﬁnal analysis, a theory of the mind-brain
connection: a theory of how our idea-like knowings are connected to our evolving
physically described brains.
The micro-macro separation that enters into Copenhagen QM is actually a
separation between what is described in quantum mechanical physical terms and
what is described in terms of our experiences—expressed in terms of our everyday
concepts of the physical world, reﬁned by the concepts of classical physics [28,
Sect. 3.5].
To pass from quantum pragmatism to quantum ontology one can treat all phys-
ically described aspects quantum mechanically, as Von Neumann did. He effectively
transformed the Copenhagen pragmatic version of QM into a potentially ontological
version by shifting the brains and bodies of the observers—and all other physically
described aspects of the theory—into the part described in quantum mechanical
language. The entire physically described universe is treated quantum mechanically,
and both our knowledge, and the process by means of which we acquire our
knowledge about the physically described world, are elevated to essential features of
the theory, not merely postponed, or ignored! Thus certain aspects of reality that had
been treated superﬁcially in the earlier classical theories—namely “our knowledge”
and “the process by means of which we acquire our knowledge”—were now
incorporated into the theory in a detailed way.
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason
105

Speciﬁcally, each acquisition of knowledge was postulated to involve, ﬁrst, a
“choice of probing action executed by an observing agent”, followed by “a choice
on the part of nature” of a response to the agent’s request (demand) for this
particular piece of experientially speciﬁed information.
This response on the part of nature is asserted by orthodox quantum mechanics
to be controlled by random chance, by a throw of nature’s dice, with the associated
probabilities speciﬁed purely in terms of physically described properties. These
“random” responses create a sequence of collapses of the quantum state of the
universe, with the universe created at each stage concordant with the new state of
“our knowledge”.
If Nature’s choices conform strictly to these orthodox statistical rules then the
results reported by Bem cannot be accommodated. However, if nature is not
capricious—if God does not play dice with the universe—but Nature’s choices have
sufﬁcient reasons, then, given the central role of “our knowledge” in quantum
mechanics, it becomes reasonable to consider the possibility that Nature’s choices
are not completely determined in the purely mechanical way speciﬁed by the
orthodox rules, but can be biased away from the orthodox rules in ways that depend
upon the character of the knowledge/experiences that these choices are creating.
The results reported by Bem can then be explained in simple way that elevates the
individual “choices on the part of nature” from “choices that are determined by
absolutely nothing at all”, to “choices that arise from relevant conditions that
include the experienced emotions of biological agents.”
In classical statistical physics such a biasing of the statistics would not produce
the appearance of retrocausation. But in quantum mechanics it does! The way that
the biasing of the forward-in-time quantum causal structure leads to seemingly
“retrocausal” effects will now be explained.
Backward in Time Effects in Quantum Mechanics
The idea that choices made now can inﬂuence what has already happened needs to
be clariﬁed, for this idea is, in some basic sense, incompatible with our idea of the
meaning of time. Yet the empirical results of Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiments
[32], and the more elaborate delayed-choice experiments of Scully and colleagues
[33] are saying that, in some sense, what we choose to investigate now can inﬂu-
ence what happened in the past. This backward-in-time aspect of QM is neatly
captured by an assertion made in the recent book “The Grand Design” by Hawking
and Mlodinow: “We create history by our observations, history does not create us”
[34].
How can one make rationally coherent sense out of this strange feature of QM?
I believe that the most satisfactory way is to introduce the concept of “process
time”. This is a “time” that is different from the “Einstein time” of classical
deterministic physics. That classical time is the time that is joined to physically
described space to give classical Einstein space-time. (For more details, see my

chapter in “Physics and the Ultimate Signiﬁcance of Time” SUNY, 1986, Ed.
David Ray Grifﬁn. In this book three physicists, D. Bohm, I. Prigogine, and I, set
forth some basic ideas pertaining to time [35].)
Orthodox quantum mechanics features the phenomena of collapses (or reduc-
tions) of the evolving quantum mechanical state. In orthodox Tomonaga-Schwinger
relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory [36, 37, 38], the quantum state collapses not on an
advancing sequence of constant time surfaces (lying at a sequence of times t(n),
with t(n + 1) > t(n), as in non-relativistic QM), but rather on an advancing
sequence of space-like surfaces R(n). (For each n, every point on the spacelike
surface R(n) is spacelike displaced from every other point on R(n), and every point
on R(n + 1) either coincides with a point on R(n), or lies in the open future
light-cone of some points on R(n), but not in the open backward light-cone of any
point of R(n).)
At each surface R(n) a projection operator P(n), or its complement P'(n) = I −P
(n), acts to reduce the quantum state to some part of its former self!
For each surface R(n) there is an associated “block universe”, which is deﬁned
by extending the quantum state on R(n) both forward and backward in time via the
unitary time evolution operator generated by the Schrödinger equation. Let the
index n that labels the surfaces R(n) be called “process time”. Then for each instant
n of process time a “new history” is deﬁned by the backward-in-time evolution
from the newly created state on R(n).
This new “effective past” is the past that smoothly evolves into the future the
quantum state (of the universe) that incorporates the effects of the psycho-physical
event that just occurred. As far as current predictions about the future are concerned
it is as if the past were the “effective past”: the former actual past is no longer
pertinent because it fails to incorporate the effects of the psycho-physical event that
just occurred.
In orthodox QM each instant of process time corresponds to an “observation”:
the collapse at process time n reduces the former quantum state to the part of itself
that is compatible with the increased knowledge generated by the new observation.
This sequential creation of a sequence of new “effective pasts” is perhaps the
strangest feature of orthodox quantum mechanics, and the origin of its other strange
features.
The
actual
evolving
physical
universe
is
generated
by
the
always-forward-moving creative process. It is forward-moving in the sense that the
sequence of surfaces R(n) advances into the future, and at each instant n of process
time some deﬁnite, never-to-be-changed, psycho-physical events happens. But this
forward-moving creative process generates in its wake an associated sequence of
effective pasts, one for each process time n. The conditions that deﬁne the effective
past associated with process time n change the preceding effective past imposing a
“ﬁnal” condition that represents what happened at process time n. It is this “ef-
fective past” that evolves directly into the future, and is the past that, from a future
perspective, has smoothly evolved into what exists “now”. The actual past is not
relevant to a history of the universe that starts from now and looks back, and
projects smoothly into the immediate future.
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason
107

The “histories” approach to quantum physics focuses attention on histories,
rather than the generation of the profusion of incompatible possibilities. Both the
effective past and the history associated with process time n depend upon which
experiment is performed at time n, and in quantum mechanics that choice of which
experiment is performed at process time n is not determined by the quantum state at
process time n: it depends upon the agent’s “free choice” of which probing action to
initiate, where the word “free” speciﬁes precisely the fact that this choice on the part
of the agent is not determined by the known laws of nature.
Two key features of von Neumann’s rules are mathematical formalizations of
two basic features of the earlier pragmatic Copenhagen interpretation of Bohr,
Heisenberg, Pauli, and Dirac. Associated with each observation there is an initial
“choice on the part of the observer” of what aspect of nature will be probed. This
choice is linked to an empirically recognizable possible outcome “Yes”, and an
associated projection operator P(n) that, if it acts on the prior quantum state q,
reduces that prior state to the part of itself compatible with the knowledge gleaned
from the experiencing of the speciﬁed outcome “Yes”.
The process that generates the observer’s choice of the probing action is not
speciﬁed by contemporary quantum mechanics: this choice is, in this very speciﬁc
sense, a “free choice on the part of the experimenter.” Once this choice of probing
action is made and executed, then, in Dirac’s words, there is “a choice on the part of
nature”: nature randomly selects the outcome, “Yes” or “No” in accordance with
the statistical rule speciﬁed by quantum theory. If Nature’s choice is “Yes” then P
(n) acts on the prior quantum state q, and if nature’s answer is “No” then the
complementary projection operator P'(n) = I −P(n) acts on the prior state.
Multiple-choice observations are accommodated by decomposing the possibility
“No” into sub-possibilities “Yes” and “No”.
Mathematical Details
The description of orthodox quantum mechanics given above is a didactic
equation-free account of what follows from the equations of quantum measurement
theory. Some basic mathematical details are given in this section.

expressed by the two basic formulas of quantum measurement theory:

Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason

Here the integer “n” identiﬁes an element in the global sequence of probing
“measurement” actions. The symbol q(n) represents the quantum state (density
matrix) of the observed physical system (ultimately the entire physically described
universe, here assumed closed) immediately after the nth measurement action; P
(n) is the (projection) operator associated with answer “Yes” to the question posed
by the nth measurement action, and P'(n) = I −P(n) is analogous projection
operator associated in the same way with the answer “No” to that question, with
“I” the unit matrix. The formulas have been reduced to their essences by ignoring
the unitary evolution between measurements, which is governed by the Schrödinger
equation.
The expectation value <P(n + 1)>Y is the normal orthodox probability that
nature’s response to the question associated with P(n + 1) will be “Yes”, and hence
that q(n + 1) will be q(n + 1)Y. In the second equation I have used the deﬁning
property of projection operators, PP = P, and the general property of the trace
operator: for any X and Y, Tr(XY) = Tr(YX). (The trace operation Tr is deﬁned by:
Tr(M) = Sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix M).
Of course, one cannot know the density matrix q of the entire universe. The
orthodox rules tell us to construct a “reduced” density matrix by taking a partial
trace over the degrees of freedom about which we are ignorant, and renormalizing.
This eliminates from the formulas the degrees of freedom about which we are
ignorant.
The trace operation is the quantum counterpart of the classical integration over
all of phase space. The classical operation is a summation that gives equal a priori
weighting to equal volumes of phase space. That is the weighting that is invariant
under canonical transformations, which express physical symmetries. The quantum
counterparts of the canonical transformations are the unitary transformations, which
leave the trace unchanged. Thus the orthodox trace rules are the rational way to give
appropriate weights to properties about which we have no knowledge, namely by
assuming that properties related by physical symmetries should be assigned equal a
priori weights.
All this is just orthodox quantum mechanics, elaborated to give a rationally
coherent ontological account compatible with the standard computational rules and
predictions [39].
But the assumption that nature gives equal weights to properties that we, in our
current state of scientiﬁc development, assume should be given equal weights, does
not mean that nature itself must give such properties equal weight. Two states of the
brain that are assigned equal statistical weight by the orthodox trace rule may be
very different in the sense that one corresponds to a meaningful, coherent, pleasing
experience and the other does not. Classical mechanics postulates that experiential
qualities, per se, can make no difference in the ﬂow of physical events. But, since
quantum mechanics places experiences in a much more central role than classical
mechanics, there is no rationally compelling reason to postulate in quantum
mechanics that nature, in the process of choosing outcomes of empirical questions
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason
109

posed by agents, must be oblivious to the experiential aspects of reality. That issue
should be settled by empirical ﬁndings, not by classical-physics-based prejudice.
Consider a situation in which: (1), an agent (the participant) observes a property
that corresponds to a projection operator P; and (2), a dynamically independent
random number generator (RNG) creates either the property represented by the
projection operator Q, or the property represented by the complementary property
Q’ = (I −Q). Suppose at some time after these properties have been created they
are still conﬁned to two different systems that have never interacted, so that
PQ = QP, and q = q(P) q(Q). Then the probability of getting the answer (PYes),
given that (QYes) occurs, is:
Trace PQq=Trace Qq ¼ Tr Pq P
ð Þ=Tr q P
ð Þ;
which is independent of Q: the probability of P does not depend on what the
dynamically independent RNG does.
Suppose, now, the two systems interact later, beginning at time t, then the
propagation to a ﬁnal later time t’, at which time an observable corresponding to
projection operator R is measured. The predicted statistical correlation between the
outcomes of the measurements associated with P and the outcomes of measure-
ments associated with Q will now normally depend upon whether the outcome of
the ﬁnal measurement is the “Yes” associated with projection operator R, or the
“No” associated with the projection operator (I −R). But the orthodox rules ensure
that if one sums the contributions from R and (I −R), using the weights prescribed
by those orthodox rules, then this dependence on R will drop out. If, on the other
hand, the probabilities of nature’s choices between R and (I −R) differ from the
orthodox ones, then, after Nature’s biased choice, the theory predicts observable
correlations between the outcomes of the measurements of P and Q: the outcomes
of these measurements that are predicted to be uncorrelated by orthodox quantum
mechanics will now be predicted to be correlated. This change in the predictions
arise from the contributions of some extra weighted histories brought in by Nature’s
biased choice, and the absence of some other weighted histories.
Applications to Bem’s Experiments
All nine of Bem’s experiments have the following general form: First, in each
instance in a series of experimental instances, the participant is presented with some
(in most cases emotionally neutral) options, and picks a subset of these options as
‘preferred’. These preferences are duly recorded. Later, for each instance, an
emotional stimulus is applied to the participant. The stimulus, and the way it is
applied to the participant, is determined by some random number generators
(RNGs). These RNGs are, according to both classical and quantum ideas,
dynamically independent of the participant’s earlier actions. But Bem’s empirical
110
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason

result is that the probability that an option is preferred by the participant at the
earlier time depends upon choices made later by the RNGs.
This ﬁnding seems to suggest that either the believed-to-be dynamically inde-
pendent RNGs are being inﬂuenced in a mysterious and complex way by the
participant’s earlier actions; or the participant’s earlier actions are being affected in
a complex retrocausal (backward-in-time causal) way by the choices made by
RNGs.
The kinds of actions made by the participant, and by the RNGs, vary greatly
over the nine experiments. But, from a quantum standpoint, one single presumption
explains all of the reported results, and explains them all in a basically
forward-in-time causal way, without any mysterious inﬂuence of the participant’s
choice of preference on the RNGs. This presumption is that the choices on the part
of nature, which are essential elements of orthodox quantum mechanics, are slightly
biased, relative to the orthodox quantum statistical rules, in favor of the actual-
ization of positive feelings in the mind of the participant, or, in other cases, against
the actualization of negative feelings.
For example, in the ﬁrst Bem experiment the participant is shown two similar
screens, L and R, and is told that behind one screen lies a picture, and behind the
other lies the image of a blank wall. S/he is instructed to choose a “preferred”
screen, P (either L or R) behind which s/he feels the picture lies. After the partic-
ipant’s preference P, either L or R, is recorded, a ﬁrst random number generator,
RNG1, chooses a “target” screen T (either L or R), and assigns a picture to target
screen T, and an image of a blank wall to the other screen. A second random
number generator, RNG2, decides, with equal probabilities, whether the picture will
be “Erotic” or “Neutral” (The stimulus type S is either E or N). What has been
determined by the RNGs to lie behind the preferred screen P is then shown to the
participant.
Bem’s empirical result is that the participants choose, more often than orthodox
quantum mechanics (or classical statistical mechanics) predicts, the screen behind
which will lie an erotic picture, but prefers L and R with equal probability if RNG2
chooses a “neutral” picture.
If the well-tested random number generators are working as they normally do
then this empirical result would appear to be a case of retrocausation (causal action
backward in time): the choices made later by the two RNGs are inﬂuencing the
subject’s earlier choice between L and R. The idea that the present can actually
change the past would introduce huge conceptual problems into quantum
mechanics, and would require a major re-thinking and re-construction of the entire
theory, centering on the problem of how to retain the massive body of valid pre-
dictions. It would bring into play Hofstadter’s observation that the whole ediﬁce of
contemporary theory would be toppled. Changing the past would often cause big
changes in the present. How could one salvage the predictions of the tremendously
successful orthodox physical theory?
An alternative possibility is that RNG2, which chooses between “erotic” and
“neutral”, is being inﬂuenced by the participant’s earlier choice between L and R,
so that the screen behind which the participant looks will tend to be erotic. But this
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason
111

should occur only if RNG1 chooses “picture” not “blank wall”. Moreover, the key
variable is an emotional response on the part of the subject that has not yet occurred
when the supposed action of the subject’s earlier choice between two neutral
images upon RNG2s choice is supposed to occur. That emotional response is ﬁxed
by an arbitrary mechanism, designed by the experimenters, that has not yet been
brought into play.
These problems constitute major difﬁculties. But Bem’s results are explained in
natural, rational, essentially forward-causal way, without any apparent difﬁculties,
provided Nature’s choice of the participant’s ﬁnal experience—a choice that is an
absolutely essential element of orthodox quantum theory—favors, relative to the
statistical predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics, the occurrence of positive
(pleasing) experiences and disfavors the occurrence of negative (displeasing)
feelings. If such a biasing of Nature’s choices were to occur, then the observed
greater likelihood of the participant’s choosing the screen, L or R, behind which an
erotic picture will lie would arise directly from the enhanced likelihood that nature
will actualize an erotic experience rather than an experience of a neutral picture or a
blank wall.
In this experimental set up an erotic experience can occur only if P = T and
S = E: the participant’s earlier choice of the between L and R must agree with the
later choice of RNG1 between L and R, since otherwise the participant will see only
a blank wall, and even if P = T, the choice of stimulus S must be E, since otherwise
the participant will see a neutral picture.
A compact way of stating this explanation is to say that the quantum histories
[deﬁned by the sequences of choices (P, T, S, F) leading to the ﬁnal experience
F = +, or F = −] that lead to F = + are more likely to occur than the rules of
orthodox quantum mechanics predict. Only those histories in which the two L/R
choices agree (P = T) can lead to an erotic experience, because if these two choices
disagree the participant will see a blank wall. But this enhancement will occur only
in the subset of histories in which S = E.
In Bem’s Experiment 2, “Precognitive Avoidance of (Subliminal) Negative
Stimuli”, a sequence of similar pairs of neutral pictures is shown to the participant,
who chooses a ‘preferred’ picture from each neutral pair. After each such recorded
choice of preference P, a RNG1 makes a random choice of one picture from the
initial pair. The picture chosen by RNG1 is called the ‘target’ T. Then the apparatus
ﬂashes a subliminal picture, the stimulus S, that is positive, S = +, if T = P, but is
highly negative, S = −, if the preferred neutral picture P is not the subsequently
randomly chosen target picture T.
The normal idea of forward causation does not allow this random choice of
target, and the associated application of a stimulus, both of which occur after the
recorded choice of preference, to affect, in any instance, the participant’s previously
recorded choice of preference between two matched neutral pictures. Yet Bem’s
predicted and empirically validated result is that the picture P preferred at an earlier
time by a participant is more likely to be the subsequently chosen target picture T
than the subsequently chosen non-target, even though the choice between target and
non-target was 50–50 random, and was made only later. The non-targeted pictures,
112
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason

which are, according to Bem’s empirical ﬁndings, less likely to be preferred than
chance predicts, are the pictures that occur in conjunction with the later subliminal
application to the participant of highly unpleasant pictures. Hence they should lead
to unpleasant participant feelings and should therefore, according to the present
hypothesis, be less likely than chance predicts to be selected by Nature’s choice to
become an actually experienced outcome:
\ P; T not P; S; F
ð
Þ [ \ \P; T ¼ P: S þ ; F þ [ :
This experimental protocol is quite different from the protocol of the ﬁrst
experiment. In the ﬁrst experiment the stimulus that was applied later to the par-
ticipant was independent of the participant’s earlier choice of preference, whereas in
experiment 2 the stimulus that is applied later to the participant depends upon the
earlier choice of preference. Moreover, the stimulus was supraliminal in the ﬁrst
experiment but subliminal in the second experiment.
Nevertheless, the apparently retrocausal effect in the second experiment follows
from the same quantum assumption as before, namely that Nature’s choice of which
ﬁnal experience actually occurs has a tendency to increase the likelihood of posi-
tive, and diminish the likelihood of negative, ﬁnal feelings of the participant. In
experiment 2 the effect of this biasing is to diminish the likelihood of instances in
which the ﬁnal feeling of the participant is negative, due to the earlier application to
the participant of an (albeit subliminal) highly negative stimulus.
Bem’s experiments 3 and 4 are “Retrocausal Primings”. Unlike the ﬁrst two
experiments, they do not involve matched neutral pairs between which the partic-
ipant must choose. Rather, each instance now involves a single picture, which is
emotionally either positive or negative. This non-neutral picture is shown to the
participant, who responds by pressing a ﬁrst or second button according to whether
s/he feels the picture to be pleasing or not. The time that it takes for the participant
to react to the picture is recorded. Then, a ‘word’ is selected by a RNG, and is
(supraliminally) shown to the participant. The previously recorded reaction time
turns out to be shorter or longer according to whether feeling of the word is
“congruent” or ‘incongruent” to the feeling of the picture experienced earlier. For
example, the word “beautiful” is congruent to the picture of Grace Kelly, but
incongruent to a picture of Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula.
There is also a ‘normal’ version of the experiment in which the word chosen by
the RNG is displayed before the participant chooses his preference. Bem’s exper-
imental set-up is one for which, also in the ‘normal’ version, the recorded reaction
time is shorter or longer according to whether feeling of the word is “congruent” or
“incongruent” to the feeling of the picture shown earlier.
The question at issue is: How, in the retrocausal version, can the reaction time,
which was recorded earlier, depend on which word was randomly selected later?
This empirical ﬁnding is explained by an assumed biasing of “Nature’s choice”
of the participant’s ﬁnal feeling that favors congruency in the ﬂow of experience
over incongruency. Such a putative biasing of Nature’s choice has the effect of
adding to the effective past, after nature’s biased choice, some extra histories that
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason
113

lead to the mentioned positive feelings, or to the subtraction of histories that lead to
analogous negative feelings. These differences in the set of contributing histories, in
accordance with the nature of the feeling induced by the stimulus word, have an
effect on the quantum state of the participant’s brain during the process of his or her
choosing between positive and negative pictures. This effect on the brain during
that period is similar to the effect of applying a similar stimulus before the par-
ticipant’s choice of response. In both cases the “effective past” state of the brain of
the participant during his or her process of choosing a response is changed in
essentially the same way: it is not important whether the change in the effective
state of the participant’s brain, during the process of choosing his or her preference,
comes from changes in the earlier or later boundary condition on that “effective
past” state of the brain. The key point is that, as discussed in earlier sections, the
“effective past” incorporates the conditions imposed by the occurrence of the ﬁnal
outcome! A “history” starts from what is now known, and extends backward from
the known present, which depends on nature’s most recent choice.
The next three experiments relate to the well-known phenomena of “habitua-
tion”. The participant is again shown an emotionally matched pair of pictures, and
is asked which one s/he prefers. The two matched pictures are both strongly neg-
ative, both strongly positive (erotic), or both essentially neutral in the ﬁrst, second,
and third experiments, respectively. (I have slightly reorganized Bem’s data in this
way for logical clarity, and ignored some inconclusive data with small statistics in
which certain later stimuli were supraliminal.) After the participant makes a binary
recorded choice of preference, an RNG chooses one of the two similar pictures as
target, and the targeted picture is subliminally ﬂashed several times. The subliminal
re-exposures, made after the participant’s choice of preference of the targeted
emotion-generating picture, have the effect of reducing, in the case of the positive
pairs of pictures, and increasing in the case of negative pairs of pictures, the fraction
of instances in which the (previously) preferred picture was the target rather than
the non-target: the effective positivity/negativity of the targeted (and hence
repeatedly subliminally represented) pictures was reduced. This is explained by a
reduction in the emotional intensity of the participant’s ﬁnal feeling, caused by the
repeated re-exposure to the highly emotional pictures, and the attendant diminua-
tion of the biasing of Nature’s choices.
In the ﬁnal two (memory) experiments the participant is exposed to a sequence
of 48 common everyday nouns, and is then tested see which words s/he remembers.
Afterwards, 24 of the original set of words are randomly chosen to be ‘targets, and
then, in a sequence of computer-controlled actions, the participant is repeatedly
re-exposed to each of the target words, but to none of the non-target words. It is
subsequently found that among the recalled words there are more target words than
non-target words. This is explained if Nature’s choice of the participant’s ﬁnal
feelings favors the feel of congruent streams of conscious experiences over the feel
of less congruent ones.
Of course, the actual past has not been changed. If the participant had been
graded “pass or fail” according to the number of words recalled, then his grade
would not depend upon what happened later. In that earlier test each initially
114
Appendix D: The Paranormal and the Principle of Sufﬁcient Reason

presented word would either be recalled or not recalled, and s/he would pass of fail
on the basis of the number recalled. Suppose 60% are recalled and 40% are not
recalled, which is failing. Given any thus-determined particular individual outcome
one could ﬁnd out, after the experiment, whether it was targeted or not. Suppose, as
an extreme case, that targeting is extremely effective and that every targeted word is
recalled, and no non-targeted word is recalled. That would give a perfect positive
correlation between recall and targeting, but would not change the grade from
failing to passing. If Nature’s choices can be biased relative to the orthodox pre-
dictions in the way indicated by the Bem experiments, then empirically observed
correlations between recorded past events can be a consequence of the actualizing
capacity of Nature’s biased choices, rather than an expression of correlations that
existed prior to Nature’s choices of which of the quantum-generated potentialities to
make actual. This would render the past unchangeable, but the future somewhat
dependent upon our desires, and the congruency of thoughts.
All of Bem’s reported results are thus explained by a single presumption, namely
that Nature’s choices, rather than being strictly random, in accordance with the rules
of contemporary orthodox quantum mechanics, are sometimes slightly biased,
relative to the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics, in favor of outcomes
that feel pleasing, and against outcomes that feel displeasing.
This explanation is “scientiﬁc”, in the sense that it can be falsiﬁed. If the output
of the RNGs were to be observed by an independent observer, before the
RNG-chosen action is made on the participant, then the biasings reported by Bem
should disappear, because Nature’s choice would then be about the possible
experiences of the independent observer rather than about those of the participant.
A more elaborate test would be to have two participants doing the experiment on
the same sequence of pictures, with reversed polarities. A dependence upon who
ﬁrst experiences the output of the RNG would, if it were to occur, constitute
spectacular support for the notion that our experiences really do inﬂuence the
course of physically described events, rather than being merely causally inert
by-products of a process completely determined by purely physical considerations
alone.

quantum-process-based random number generators. In some of the experiments the
RNG was actually a pseudo-random number generator, a PRNG. In principle a
PRNG is, in these experiments, just as good as a true RNG, unless at the time of its
effective action some real observer actually knows everything needed to specify
what the pseudo-random choice must be. Unless the outcome is actually speciﬁed
by what is actually currently known by observing agents, the outcome is, within this
orthodox framework, effectively undetermined.

Conclusion
Bem’s seemingly backward-in-time causal effects can be explained within a
quasi-orthodox forward-in-time quantum mechanics. In this variation of orthodox
theory, Nature’s “random” choices of which outcomes of measurements to actualize
are slightly biased away from the random choices prescribed by the orthodox theory
in favor of outcomes that actualize positive feelings of the participants, and against
outcomes that actualize negative feelings of the participants.

form a rationally coherent understanding of the world that we human beings
inhabit, and of our role within it.
I have been thinking about the matters for more than 50 years. Already in 1958 I
was working on them in Zurich with Wolfgang Pauli, a principal founder of
quantum mechanics.
When he unexpectedly died, I read von Neumann’s book on these matters, and
then wrote an essay to myself entitled:
Mind, Matter, and Quantum Mechanics,
which eventually developed into a 1993 book of the same title.
In the seventies I worked on these matters in Munich with Werner Heisenberg
and wrote in the American Journal of Physics a seminal article entitled “The
Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics”. I have continued to think and
write about these matters.
The ﬁrst topic is quantum mechanics. In order to understand Quantum Mechanics,
it is important contrast it with what came before it, namely “Classical Mechanics”.
Classical Mechanics was created by Isaac Newton, who said “It seems to me probable
that God in the beginning created matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable movable
particles.” These particles can interact locally by contact, like billiard balls. But they
can also act upon each other by gravitational attraction. In Newton’s theory gravity
acts instantaneously over astronomical distances. Thus already at the beginning of
modern science we encounter a “Spooky action-at-distance.”
However, about 200 years later, Maxwell created a wave theory of the inter-
actions between charged particles: The information carried by such a wave could be

transmitted no faster than a certain maximal speed that could be calculated, and
turned out to be the empirically measured speed of light. Maxwell’s waves were
Light Waves.
A few years later Einstein, in his theory of relativity, re-formulated all of clas-
sical physics so that no physical structure could transmit information faster than the
speed of light. Thus Einstein banished Spooky action-at-a-distance from classical
physics.
A second main property of classical physics is physical determinism, which says
that all physically described properties are completely determined by prior physi-
cally described properties.
This property is also called the “Causal Closure of the Physical”. It means that
the behavior of your physical body was completely predetermined already at the
birth of the universe:
This property turns you into a mechanical automaton, and converts your intu-
ition that your conscious “free will” can inﬂuence your bodily behavior into a
pervasive illusion.
However, that conclusion does not carry over to the quantum world.
Quantum Mechanics.
The quantum story begins with Max Planck’s discovery at the beginning of the
twentieth century that Light Waves have a corpuscular character: The transfer of
energy between light waves and physical particles seems to occur in ﬁnite
“chunks”, called “quanta”. The sizes of these “chunks” are directly proportional to
the frequency of the light.
Atomic physicists then tried to construct a conception of atoms that would
account for all the existing empirical facts. They tried at ﬁrst to use the same kinds
of ideas that Newton had used to explain the motions of the planets circling about
the sun to explain, now, the motions of the electrons circling about the atomic
nucleus. A 25 year struggle showed that that idea would not work. Then
Heisenberg, and also Schrödinger, working independently, discovered the equation
that made it all work. And that equation, properly generalized, covered not only
single atoms, but also collections of arbitrarily large numbers of atoms, and hence
large hard objects such as tables and chairs, and also, among other things, the
measuring devices that are used to measure atomic properties. The theory gives
predictions about, for example, the location on a dial of visible “Pointer”. The
position of this pointer reports to us human observers the value of some micro-
scopic property of the system being examined.
The problem, however, is that this straight-forward prediction does not agree
with human perceptions. The predicted position of the pointer turns out to be a
smear over a large range of possible values, whereas the human observers see the
position of the pointer conﬁned, within small errors, to some tiny region of the dial.
Thus the basic problem is:
How are we to deal with this sharp disagreement between the quantum laws,
which in principle ought to control the evolving state of the (interacting) atomic
constituents of the world, with our perceptions of the world composed of those
constituents?
118
Appendix E: The Quantum Conception of Man1

The solution offered by quantum theory is expressed in Bohr’s oft-repeated
dictum:
In the drama of existence we are ourselves both actor’s and spectators,
and in John Wheeler’s likening of the quantum process of measurement to the
game of twenty questions.
The details of this solution are most clearly spelled out in John von Neumann’s
rigorous reformulation of Copenhagen Quantum Mechanics. He explicitly intro-
duces into the quantum dynamics, in addition to the normal quantum dynamical
process, which he calls Process II, another dynamical process that he calls Process I.
This Process I converts the “Mental Observer” from a causally inert Spectator to
a causally efﬁcacious Actor. This Process I action has two phases. In the ﬁrst phase
the observer’s mental aspect, his “ego” in von Neuman’s terminology, poses a
question: “Will my perception be P, where P is a classically described perception.”
In the second phase “Nature chooses and implements a psycho-physically described
response, “Yes” or “No” to the observer’s query.
The two main points are, ﬁrst, that the observer’s mental aspects are given a
certain physically effective dynamical role in the evolution of the physically
described universe—and, second, that a globally effective “Nature” produces an
instantaneous global collapses that reinstate “Spooky action-at-a-distance”.
This active dynamical role of the “Ego”, even though it is only to instigate
probing physical actions, is sufﬁcient to allow, by means of rigorously speciﬁed
basic quantum mechanical properties alone, a person’s mental intentions to inﬂu-
ence that person’s bodily behavior in the mentally intended way. Quantum
mechanics thus explains how your free-willed mental choices can be causally
effective in the physical world!
It must be mentioned that in the late 1940s physicists (Tomonaga/Schwinger)
created “Relativistic Quantum Field Theory”, which allows all of the empirical
consequences of Einstein’s theory of relativity to be maintained in spite of the
underlying spooky actions-at-a-distance associated with measurements.
Personal and Social Beneﬁts of the Rescue of Free Will.
1. According to classical mechanics, your mental willful efforts can make no
difference in the physically described world. If you are a rational person who
bases your beliefs about the world upon science, then a belief in classical
mechanics is debilitating, for it rationally causes you to believe that any effort
you might make to improve your life or the lives of others is completely futile.
On the other hand, your updated knowledge of the quantum mechanical char-
acter of the world is empowering because it lends scientiﬁc support to your
essential-to-life, and experience-based, intuition that actions initiated by your
value-based efforts can tend to bring pass that which you personally value.
2. Our legal system is based on the idea of personal responsibility for one’s
physical actions. But, according to classical mechanics, every physical action
was predetermined at the birth of the universe. A person cannot rationally be
held responsible for physical actions that were physically pre-ordained at the
Appendix E: The Quantum Conception of Man1
119

birth of the universe. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, does not entail any
such
physical
predetermination,
and
thereby
evades
the
classical-mechanics-based challenge to the rationality of our justice system!
Bell’s Theorems.
Einstein banished Spooky action-at-a-distance from classical mechanics. His
reaction to the instantaneous action at a distance that occurs in standard quantum
mechanics was to agree with the founders of quantum mechanics that the rules of
quantum mechanics should be viewed as mere practical computational procedures
that allow scientists to make reliable predictions about future human experiences on
the basis of their past experiences/perceptions. But Einstein believed that behind
these merely statistical rules should lie a “reality” that likewise involves no Spooky
action-at-a-distance.
Already in classical mechanics one can draw a distinction between a statistical
state of a system and the underlying “real” possible states of that system: The
statistical state is represented as a sum of terms each of which is a product of a
positive weight factor times a possible “real” state.
John Stuart Bell formulated Einstein’s position as the assertion that each of the
statistically interpreted states of quantum mechanics can be expressed as a sum of
terms each of which is a product of a positive weight factor times a possible “real”
state
that,
in
accordance
with
Einstein’s
intuition,
allows
no
faster-than-light-action-at-a-distance. Bell and his associates proved many theorems
that showed that no such decomposition is possible.
Those theorem’s address one possible formulation of Einstein’s position, but not
the general question of whether the various empirical predictions of quantum
mechanics can be satisﬁed if all spooky actions-at-distance are banned, in the sense
that (in the standard example of a pertinent experiment, proposed by David Bohm)
for each of the two alternative possible choices of which property is measured in a
region the outcome there is independent of which experiment is freely chosen and
performed at essentially the same time very far away. That is a cleaner formulation
of Einstein’s stated position, and it can be shown that such a banishing of Spooky
actions cannot be reconciled with four basic and empirically well-validated pre-
dictions of quantum mechanics.
This result shows that Spooky actions cannot be banned, and hence that a
materialistic conception of the physically described aspects of the world is
incompatible with the empirical facts!

Mind, Brain, and Neuroscience
Introduction
The currently dominant theories of the connection of our conscious thoughts to our
physical brains are based on the principles of classical mechanics. But those the-
ories have achieved essentially no success in answering the “hard” question of how
things as conceptually disparate as our conscious thoughts and classically con-
ceived matter can combine together to form psychophysical human beings.
Yet classical mechanics is known to be empirically false. It has been replaced at
the fundamental level by quantum mechanics. The primary difference between
these two theories is that the classical mechanics never mentions our experiences
whereas quantum mechanics is fundamentally about them, as Niels Bohr has often
emphasized in statements such as:
In our description of nature the purpose is not to disclose the real essence of phenomena,
but only to track down as far as possible the multifold aspects of our experience [I, 18].
Thus our conscious experiences are the fundamental realities in quantum
mechanics, whereas classical mechanics leaves them completely out.
It is therefore manifestly obvious that if a rational understanding of the
mind-brain connection is being sought then quantum mechanics is the better theory
to use. But why, then, are neuroscientist not using it?
The answer, I believe, it is simply that neuroscientists have not been shown how
to do so. They have not been shown how to use the quantum mechanical model of
the human person to compute, for example, the measured in vivo brain response to
an associated mental choice.
My purpose in this talk is to illustrate how this is done, and compare the results
to recent pertinent neuroscience data.
This example illustrates the quantitative workings of the quantum mechanical
explanation of the inﬂuence of conscious intentions on in vivo brain activity.

Classical Description
An important feature of the seismic shift from classical to quantum mechanics is that
the descriptive concepts of the earlier classical mechanics do not drop out, or fade
away, but are transferred from the material reality that was supposed to lie behind our
experiences to our experiences themselves. Thus in the words of Niels Bohr:
…it is important to recognize that in every account of physical experience one must
describe both the experimental conditions and the observations by the same means of
communication that is used in classical physics (II, p. 88).
Von Neumann’s Solution to the Quantum Measurement Problem
The immediate consequence of this transfer of classical description to the mental
realm is that, in practical measurement situations, the scientist is instructed to divide
the world by a cut, called the Heisenberg cut, such that big things directly observed
by observers are placed above the cut, and are described in terms of the concepts of
classical mechanics, while things lying below the cut are described in quantum
mechanical terms.
This rule was imprecise and ambiguous, and led to the so-called “measurement
problem.” John von Neumann, on the basis of a detailed mathematical examination,
resolved this problem by moving the Heisenberg cut all the way up, until everything
normally considered to be part of the material world built of atoms and molecules,
and of the electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds that they generate, were placed
below the cut and were described in quantum mechanical terms, whereas our
conscious experiences, including our perceptions, were generally described in
psychological terms, but with our perceptions of the external world expressed in the
usual way associated with the concepts of classical physics.
The theory thus becomes a genuine psychophysical theory with the boundary
between our conscious experiences and the underlying atom-based physical world
lying at the mind-brain interface. A key aspect of the theory thus becomes a
description of what is happening at the mind-brain interface between the
experience-based
mental
aspects
and
the
quantum
mechanically
described
atom-based aspects of the evolving reality.
Classical Description, Oscillations, and the Quantum Mechanical
“Coherent States” of the Electromagnetic Field
What we see, do, and intend to do is described at the mental level in classical terms,
but at the brain level in quantum mechanical terms. This need to correlate a classical
mental description to a naturally corresponding quantum counterpart at the
122
Appendix F: Mind, Brain, and Neuroscience

mind-brain interface is met by taking this connection to be via the well-known
“coherent states” of quantum electrodynamics. These are quantum states that
exhibit a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) motion that is essentially identical to a
classical SHO motion, except that the classical point particle is replaced by a
minimum uncertainty Gaussian quantum wave packet whose center point follows
the phase-space trajectory of the classical oscillating point (Fig. F1).
Our interest is in the possible inﬂuence upon the radius R of the mental choices
made by the owner of the brain, within the framework of von Neumann’s
dynamical theory of the mind-brain connection.
Von Neumann’s Dynamical Theory of the Mind-Brain Connection
The central problem in quantum mechanics is that the basic dynamical equation, the
Schroedinger equation, generates not the actual evolving physical reality itself, but
only a smear of potentialities for future actualities.
But then how does what actually occurs get picked out from the smear of
potentialities?
“What becomes actual” is not picked out by nature acting alone. According to
quantum mechanics, some subject/observer/agent must pose a question: “Is my
immediately-to-appear experience Experience X?” Yes or No?. Nature immediately
answers, and in the “Yes” case delivers Experience X to the observer. In either case,
nature changes (instantaneously in a certain way) the entire physical world by
eliminating all features that are incompatible with the delivered answer, Yes or No,
that it has just chosen. This action takes care of the EPR correlations between
outcomes of effectively-simultaneous far-apart experiments.
That choice of probing question on the part of some observer will single out
some classically describable possibility. Quantum mathematics does not specify
Fig. F1 SHO Kinematics
Appendix F: Mind, Brain, and Neuroscience
123

what question will be asked. The choice, according to quantum ideas, is “a free
choice on the part of the observer”, where ‘free’ emphasizes that the choice is not
determined by the known laws of physics. The fact that what question is asked is
classically describable accords with the idea that this choice comes from the mental
realm of the observer.

By comparing Fig. 4b, with ﬁeld potentia 0.5 mV to Fig. 7 with ﬁeld potentia
20 lV = 0.02 mV I surmise that the R that we are dealing with is probably much
less than 9, and that DR is therefore not large. So the empirical numbers suggest
that the results shown in Ref. [1] are probably concordant with the proposed
understanding of von Neumann’s theory of the mental causation of bodily action.

Transcending Newton’s Legacy2
Science can inﬂuence our lives in many ways. The inﬂuence via technology is
evident. But inﬂuence through effects on social institutions, such as church and
government, can also be important. For example, the well-known inﬂuence of
Newton’s idea of “laws” upon the U.S. constitution could, in view of the immense
inﬂuence of government upon our rights and freedoms, and upon our economic
environment, be exerting tremendous inﬂuence upon our lives.
But more important than either of these is probably the inﬂuence of science upon
our idea of what we are; upon our idea of our place in the universe, and of our
connection to the power that forms it. For our aspirations and our values spring, in
the end, from our idea of what we are, and nothing is as important in our lives as the
nature of the ideas that motivate our actions, and the actions of others.
Science was transformed during the twentieth century by three revolutionary
developments: the special theory of relativity, the general theory of relativity, and
quantum theory. These developments altered not only scientiﬁc practice, but also our
ideas about the nature of science and the nature of the world itself. I shall discuss here
these three developments with regard to both their essential differences from classical
Newtonian science, and their potential impact upon the human condition.
Newtonian Science
Newtonian science must be distinguished from the full thought of Isaac Newton.
The former may be characterized by the following three conditions:
1. Absolute Time and Absolute Space. Newton’s starting point is the idea of a
“true” time and a “true” space. Each is independent of anything external to it,

and has an inherent quality of uniformity or homogeneity. These two “abso-
lutes” are contrasted by Newton to their “relative”, or “apparent” counterparts,
which we can grasp through our senses, and can measure by means of clocks
and rulers.
2. Local Ontology. Absolute space is conceived by Newton to be populated with
small bodies or particles that move with the passage of absolute time.
3. Fixed Laws of Motion. The motions of the particles are governed by “laws”.
These laws cause the locations and velocities of all particles at all times to be
determined by the locations and positions of all particles at any single time. The
world is therefore deterministic: its condition at one time determines it condition
for all time.
These features of Newtonian science give us a picture of the universe called the
Mechanical World-View. According to this view the universe consists of nothing
but objectively existing particles moving through absolute space in the course of
absolute time in a way completely determined by ﬁxed laws of motion.
This picture of the world is mathematical: the objects are described mathemat-
ically, by numbers that give the locations and velocities of all the particles.
Moreover, the laws that govern these numbers are mathematical. That Newton
aspired to the creation of a mathematical picture of Nature is proclaimed by his title:
Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.
Three Problems
Some difﬁculties with this picture of Nature were evident from the start.
I mention three:
(1) Action-at-a-distance
(2) Creation
(3) Freedom
(1)
The Problem of Action-at-a-Distance.
The centerpiece of Newton’s science is the law of gravity. According to this
law, every body in the universe acts instantaneously upon every other one,
even though they be separated by astronomical distances. Newton’s recog-
nition of a problem with this idea is expressed clearly in his famous asser-
tion: “That one body can act upon another at a distance through the vacuum
without the mediation of anything else … is to me so great an absurdity that I
believe no man, who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of
thinking, can ever fall into it”. The ontology set forth in the Principia has,
however, nothing to mediate the force of gravity. Newton worked hard to
ﬁnd carrier for gravity compatible with the available empirical evidence,
much of which came from his own experiments. Finding in the end nothing
128
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2

that met his standards he declared: “hypothesis non ﬁngo”: I frame no
hypothesis.
Two contrasting attitudes toward physical theory can thus be found in
Newton’s thinking. One attitude reﬂects his basic overriding commitment to
search for truth about Nature. This commitment is massively displayed by his
extensive researches into alchemical and theological questions pertaining to
the constitution of Nature, by his choice of title mentioned above, and by his
careful attention, in the formulation of his principles, to philosophical and
ontological details. The second attitude goes with his “hypothesis non ﬁngo”.
This declaration entails that his theory, as it stood, must, strictly speaking, be
construed not as an ontological description of Nature itself, but merely as a
codiﬁcation of connections between measurements. The theory must be
viewed as a system of rules that describes how our observations hang
together, not as a description of the underlying reality.
These two contrasting attitudes toward physical theories will be the focal
point of my discussion of how Newton’s ideas fared in the twentieth century.
The issue concerns two views of the nature of physical theory. One view
holds that basic physical theory ought to provide a description of the real
stuff from which the universe is constructed—it should describe the ultimate
things-in-themselves.
The second view holds that physical theories should deal fundamentally with
quantities that can be measured—they should merely codify the structural
features of measurable phenomena.
(2)
The Problem of Creation.
The second problem is the problem of creation. Given the Newtonian pre-
cepts two questions immediately arise.
1. What ﬁxed the nature of the particles and their laws of interaction?
2. What ﬁxed the initial locations and velocities of the particles in the
universe?
Within Newtonian science these two questions are insoluble. Thus from the
perspective of the ﬁrst attitude described above, which holds that basic
physical theory should describe the real world, the account provided by
Newtonian science is deﬁcient, for it requires something external to the
physical world it describes: it needs something to set up the system and ﬁx
the undetermined parameters.
From the second point of view, which is that science should merely codify,
not explain, this problem of creation might seem to be no problem at all. But
the problem is then with the point of view itself, which tends to close off' the
pursuit of the further knowledge. For, today, within the quantum theoretical
framework, physicists are examining theories that purport to answer the ﬁrst
of the questions raised above, just on the basis of self-consistency. Moreover,
the second question is moving into science in connection with studies per-
taining to the birth of the universe—the big bang. The question is therefore
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2
129

this: “To what can science aspire?” Can it cope with the problem of creation,
or must it remain forever mute on this basic question?
(3)
The Problem of Freedom.
Beyond these questions is one far more pressing to man. The mechanistic
world-view proclaimed by Newtonian science, and “validated” by its tech-
nological success, insists that all creative activity ceased with the birth of the
universe. It tells us that we are now living in a “dead” universe that grinds
inexorably along a path pre-ordained at the birth of the universe, and held in
place by immutable laws of nature. Thus any notion that we can, by our
efforts, act to bring into being one state of affairs rather than another is sheer
illusion and fantasy.
This dreary view is proclaimed in the name of science, and is backed by its
authority. Banished, together with freedom, is any rational notion of human
responsibility. For responsibility can be placed only where freedom lies, and
according to the precepts of Newtonian science all freedom expired when the
universe was born.
I shall return to these questions from the perspective of twentieth century
science. But ﬁrst an essential stepping stone from the ideas of Newton to
those of the twentieth century must be described.
(4)
Galileo and Lorentz.
The laws of Newton have a simple consequence: given one possible uni-
verse, evolving in accordance with Newton’s laws, it is possible to construct
another in a simple way—just add to every particle in the universe any single
common velocity. Then all separations between particles are left unchanged,
and, according to Newton’s laws, this shifted state of affairs will perpetuate
itself through all time. This property is called Galilean invariance.
In 1873 James Clark Maxwell proposed a theory of electric and magnetic
forces that was wonderfully beautiful and marvelously successful. This
theory did for electricity and magnetism what Newton had tried to do for
gravity: it explained the forces between charged particles in terms of changes
that propagate from point to neighboring point, thus abolishing the need, in
electricity and magnetism, for action-at-a-distance. However, the theory of
Maxwell was characterized by a certain maximum speed, the velocity of light
in vacuum. According to this theory no charged particle could move faster
than this maximum speed. Consequently, the property of Galilean invariance
was lost. However, Maxwell's theory had a substitute, which involved the
characteristic maximum speed, the velocity of light. This new property,
called Lorentz invariance, was to play a crucial role in what lay ahead.
(5)
Absolute Versus Relative in Twentieth Century Science. The Special Theory
of Relativity.
According to Newton’s idea of absolute time one can assert that if A and B
are two events, each of negligible duration, then either A is earlier than B, or
B is earlier than A, or they are simultaneous. The truth of any such assertion,
130
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2

say that “A is earlier than B”, is absolute: it does not depend upon anything
else.
Consider, however, two such events A and B situated so that nothing can
move from either event to the other without traveling faster than light. In this
case one cannot determine by direct observation (say the observation of one
event from the location of the other) which event occurs earlier than the
other. One might expect that such a determination could be achieved by
indirect means. However, Einstein showed that if all phenomena in Nature
enjoyed the Lorentz invariance property mentioned above then it would be
impossible in principle to determine from empirical data which of the two
events occurred ﬁrst.
The Lorentz invariance property seemed to hold universally (phenomena
associated with gravity excepted, since Newton’s theory of gravity needed to
be reformulated along the lines of Maxwell’s treatment of the electric force).
Consequently, Newton’s idea of absolute time seemed to bring into physical
theory a property that in principle could have no correlate in observable
phenomena. Einstein therefore proposed that physical theory be based not on
absolute time and absolute space, as Newton had proposed, but rather upon a
space-time structure deﬁned by idealized readings of clocks and rulers.
The resulting theory is the special theory of relativity. Physicists quickly
accepted this idea, which produced economy in notation and conception.
Thus they replaced the absolutes of Newton by their relative counterparts.
(6)
Quantum Theory.
Quantum theory is another twentieth century development that makes
measurements primary. It carries the shift from absolute to relative even
further than the special theory of relativity. For, according to the orthodox
view of quantum theorists, not only must the underlying space-time frame-
work be understood in terms of results of possible measurements, but, in fact,
the entire mathematical formalism of quantum theory must be interpreted
merely as a tool for making predictions about results of measurements. This
view of quantum theory arose from its historical origin and its intrinsic form.
But it is sustained by a reason far more compelling than mere “economy”:
every known ontology that is compatible with the phenomena, as codiﬁed by
quantum theory, is “grotesque” in some way. Orthodox physicists, reluctant
to embrace the grotesque, prefer to adopt a rational stance that separates the
predictive mathematical formalism, and the associated scientiﬁc practices,
from ontological speculations that lack empirical support.

Conversation Between Einstein and Heisenberg.
1. Werner Heisenberg was the principal creator of the formalism of quantum
theory. He has given an account of an interesting encounter with Einstein.
2. He prefaces this account with a brief description of the genesis of
quantum theory: He, Heisenberg, reﬂecting upon Einstein’s claim that a
physical theory should contain only quantities that can be directly mea-
sured, and realizing that orbits of electrons inside atoms cannot be
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2
131

observed, was led to discover rules that directly connect various mea-
surable quantities pertaining to experiments performed on atomic sys-
tems, without ever referring to unobservable orbits.
Early in 1926 Heisenberg described this new quantum theory at a symposium
in Berlin attended by Einstein. Later, in private, Einstein objected to the
feature that the atomic orbits were left out. For, he argued, the trajectories of
electrons in cloud chambers can be observed, so it seems absurd to allow
them there but not inside atoms. Heisenberg, citing the nonobservability of
orbits inside atoms, pointed out that he was merely following the philosophy
that Einstein himself had used. To this Einstein replied: “Perhaps I did use
such a philosophy earlier, and even wrote it, but it is nonsense all the same.”
Heisenberg was “astonished”: Einstein had reversed himself on the idea with
which he had revolutionized physics!
To ﬁnd the probable cause of this “astonishing” reversal it is necessary only
to look at what Einstein had done between the 1905 creation of special
relativity and the 1925 creation of quantum theory. The special theory holds,
as mentioned earlier, only to the extent that the effects of gravity can be
ignored. It was necessary to generalize the special theory to the general case
by incorporating a reformulation of Newton’s theory of gravity along the
lines of Maxwell’s theory of the electric force.
Einstein undertook this task and in 1915 announced his general theory of
relativity. Though this theory was a generalization of the special theory in
many ways, it was fundamentally different. The focus was no longer on
observers and results of measurements. The theory was about a space-time
structure that exists by itself, governed by its own nature, without relation to
anything external. It was about an “absolute” space-time structure. Einstein
was driven during his ten-year search for the general theory not by an effort
to codify data. He was driven by demands for rational coherence and by a
general principle of equivalence. He sent his work to Born saying that no
argument in favor of the theory would be given, since once the theory was
understood no such argument would be needed.
Einstein had in this work gone beyond the need for “hypothesis non ﬁngo”.
He had succeeded in doing what Newton had failed to do. He had discovered
a mathematical description of something that could be regarded as Nature
itself. The difﬁculty that defeated Newton, namely the action of gravity at a
distance without any carrier, he had resolved by ﬁrst combining: “Newton’s
absolute time and absolute space into an absolute space-time”.
(8)
Relaxing Newton’s demand for uniformity, and ﬁnally imposing his math-
ematical laws in the form of conditions on deviations from uniformity: the
presence of matter was represented by departures from uniformity—by
distortions of space-time itself.
An important difference between Einstein’s theory and that of Newton is that
in Newton’s theory time and space are independent of each other, and both
132
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2

are independent of matter. This creates, at least in principle, the possibility of
space with nothing in it: an empty arena.
The idea of empty space has puzzled philosophers since antiquity: how can
anything be nothing; that is a contradiction in terms. Thus Newton’s pre-
decessor Descartes takes extension, hence space, to be something that cannot
exist without matter. Newton’s contemporary Leibniz takes space to be
merely a system of relations. Still, it remains puzzling that so much of the
universe can be (almost) empty space if empty space is nothing at all.
Einstein’s ontology gives a marvelous solution to this ancient puzzle. Instead
of three intrinsically different things—time, space, and matter—whose
connection must then, from a logical point of view, be ad hoc, hence puz-
zling, we have only one thing: inhomogeneous space-time. Considering the
direction and achievements of Einstein’s general theory of relativity one
cannot be surprised that its creator should regard the philosophy of the
creator of the special theory of relativity as “nonsense all the same”.
The fate in the twentieth century of Newton’s two absolutes is then this: the
special theory of relativity replaced them by their relative counterparts, but
the general theory resurrected them in a combined form that incorporates also
the third element of Newton’s ontology, matter. However, quantum theory
represents a swing from the absolute back to the relative. For, according to
the orthodox view, quantum theory must be viewed as codiﬁcation of con-
nections between measurable, or relative, quantities.
With this background in place, I turn now to the question of the impact of
twentieth century science upon our ideas about Nature, and upon our ideas
about ourselves.
(9)
Impact

Upon
the
Mechanistic
World-View
of
Newtonian Science.
Quantum theory gives in general only statistical predictions. The question
thus arises: Does Nature itself have genuinely stochastic or random ele-
ments? Bohr stated the orthodox position: We ﬁnd, in practice, that even
when we prepare an atomic system to the limits of our capabilities there is
still a scatter in the results of certain experiments. Quantum theory gives
predictions with a matching irreducible scatter. Thus the statistical character
of the theory matches the statistical character of the facts. To say more than
this is empirically unsupported speculation: quantum theory says nothing
about determinism in Nature.
Quantum theory successfully describes and predicts phenomena on the basis
of a mathematical description of atoms. Can we conclude that the world is
built of atoms?
If one looks at the mathematical representation of these atoms one ﬁnds
entities that must, according to the orthodox view, be interpreted only as
parts of a computation of expectations pertaining to results of measurements.
Thus the ontological foundation is shifted from the level of the atoms to the
level of the devices that record these results, or perhaps even to the level of
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2
133

the observers who use these results to make computations. But the devices
and observers are assumed to be built from atoms. So the ontological basis
swings back to the atoms, etc.
These examples illustrate the difﬁculty in trying to draw ontological con-
clusions from a theory that must be interpreted merely as a tool for making
predictions about connections between measurements.
(10)
Quantum Theory and Reality.
It is clear to everyone that we cannot pass with certainty from knowledge
about the structure of phenomena to knowledge about the structure of the
underlying reality. Accordingly, the orthodox interpretation of quantum
theory tries to isolate, insofar as possible, the mathematical formalism, and
the scientiﬁc practices associated with it, from more speculative activities: it
tries to separate “science” from “natural philosophy”. Science is concerned
with measurable quantities, and with theoretical structures that codify the
observable and testable connections between them. Natural philosophy
concerns the conclusions that might reasonably be drawn about the form of
the underlying reality on the basis of the evidence provided by science. The
fact that Bohr and Heisenberg adhered to the view that the mathematical
formalism of quantum theory should be viewed, strictly speaking, merely as
a tool for making predictions pertaining to results of measurements in no way
implies that they had no interest in the implications that quantum theory has
in the realm of natural philosophy. In fact, each in his own way tried to draw
from the data provided by quantum theory insights into the nature of the
world that lies behind the phenomena.
(11)
Heisenberg’s Ontology.
Heisenberg in his book “Physics and Philosophy” in the chapter on the
Copenhagen interpretation actually sets forth an ontology. He begins with the
words “If we want to describe what happens in an atomic event …”. He then
goes on to describe an ontology in which the actual world is formed by
“actual events”, which occur only at the level of the macroscopic devices.
But the objective world contains also something else. It contains “objective
potentia”. These “objective potentia” are objective tendencies for the actual
events to occur. They are associated with the mathematical probabilities that
occur in quantum theory. This ontological substructure gives nothing testa-
ble. So it is not “science”.
But it gives us an informal way of “understanding” quantum theory. It gives
us an idea of what is actually going on.
This ontology described by Heisenberg is not the only ontology compatible
with the predictions of quantum theory. But it can be said to be the “most
orthodox” ontology. Most quantum physicists probably think about quan-
tum. phenomena informally in these terms: the quantum probability func-
tions corresponds somehow to the tendency for the detector to register a
particle, or the tendency for a grain in a photographic plate to register the
134
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2

absorption of a photon. The actual things occur only at the macroscopic
level.
Heisenberg’s ontology cannot be deduced from the phenomena, and is
therefore speculative, and to be distinguished from science. However, I do
not think it unreasonable to consider it seriously. All creation is certainly not
simply a collection of measurements ﬂoating on nothing else, even though
measurements are of particular interest in science, and are the source of our
most precise information about the world.
The reason it is interesting to consider the ontologies suggested by the
structure of phenomena as codiﬁed by quantum theory, and compatible with
that structure, is that the conditions thus imposed on ontologies are so
restrictive: there is no known ontology that is compatible with the conditions
on phenomena imposed by quantum theory that is not “grotesque” in the
minds of conservative thinkers. This means that quantum theory has shown
us that the world is not at all like what we had previously imagined it to be. It
is not at all like the idea of it set forth in the mechanical world-view, formerly
(pre 1900) promulgated in the name of science, and still largely dominating
the prevailing idea of what science tells us. So any curious person must
naturally be led to ask: What idea of the world is compatible with the data
provided by science?
(12)
World-View Arising From Heisenberg’s Ontology
Heisenberg’s ontology is the most-orthodox, and, in my opinion, the most
reasonable, of the known ontologies that are compatible with the predictions
of quantum theory. In the remainder of this article I shall describe the
principal features of the picture of Nature that arises from this quantum
ontology.
1. The World is Nonlocal.
Macroscopically separated parts of the universe are linked together in a
way that involves strong faster-than-light connections that do not fall off
with increasing spatial separation. This nonlocal aspect is the “grotesque”
feature of this ontology that makes it unacceptable to conservative
thought.
2. Creation is Distributed Over All Time.
In the quantum ontology the objective potentia are represented by the
quantum probability function. At each stage the quantum potentia give
tendencies for the next actual event. The occurrence of this next actual
event is represented by a “collapse” of the potentia to a new form. The
interplay of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations and the Heisenberg
equations of motion is such that, even though each successive event
effectively closes off certain possibilities, by making ﬁxed and settled
things that had formerly been unﬁxed, still, each event creates new
potentialities and possibilities. Consequently, the process of ﬁxing the
unspeciﬁed degrees of freedom, which in classical physics occurs all at
once, at the creation of the universe, is, in the quantum ontology, by
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2
135

virtue of its mathematical structure, a process that can never close off the
possibility of its further action. Thus in the quantum ontology, the cre-
ative process, in which things formerly unﬁxed become ﬁxed and settled,
does not expire at the birth of the universe, but extends rather over all
time.
3. Two Kinds of Time.
The quantum ontology has two different times. The ﬁrst is Einstein Time,
which joins with space to form Einstein's space-time. The second is
Process Time. I shall now explain the difference. The “numbers” that
appeared in Newton’s theory, and which described the positions and
velocities of the particles, are replaced in quantum theory by
(13)
“operators”, which evolve in accordance with equations, called Heisenberg’s
equations of motion.
The evolution of the quantum operators in accordance with Heisenberg’s
equations of motion is evolution in Einstein time. This evolution generates an
association of operators with space-time points: every space-time point, from
the inﬁnite past to the inﬁnite future, is associated with a ﬁxed set of
operators.
The space-time structure just described is a structure of quantum operators.
To obtain the potentia one must take these operators in conjunction with
something called the Heisenberg state vector. The Heisenberg state vector
does not depend on space-time: it refers to all of space-time. But it combines
with the operators associated with any space-time point to produce numerical
potentia associated with that space-time point.
Each actual event is associated with a “quantum jump” of the Heisenberg
state vector. Thus each actual event induces a sudden jump in the potentia.
This jump occurs at every space-time point. The sequence of quantum jumps
deﬁnes a time that is different from Einstein time. It is called Process Time.
Evolution in process time generates change or evolution of the “actual”,
whereas evolution in Einstein time generates the evolution of the “potentia”.
Thus the deterministic laws of evolution are not binding on our future, for
they determine the evolution of the potentialities, not the actual events
themselves.
(14)
Meaning in the Quantum Universe.
The creative process is represented in the quantum ontology by the sequence
of jumps in the quantum potentia. These potentia are objective tendencies,
which tend to make the statistical predictions of quantum theory hold under
appropriate conditions. But the question arises: What determines the actual
course of events? That is, what determines, in a given actual instance,
whether things will be ﬁxed in one way or another? Heisenberg’s ontology
leaves that crucial question unanswered. Hence the ontology, as presently
understood, is incomplete.
At ﬁrst’, it might seem that, in any case, the choice of what actually happens
is either deterministically ﬁxed by what has gone before, or has an element of
136
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2

true randomness or wildness. In either case, the ontology would appear to
provide no possibility for a meaningful universe: either we would have
simply a new determinism, which would render the universe just as “dead”,
and devoid of possible meaning, as the world of Newtonian mechanics, or
there would be an element of randomness, which could hardly add meaning.
Thus we are apparently still trapped between the two horns, determinism or
randomness, of the usual dilemma of the impossibility of a meaningful
universe.
To have meaning a choice must have intentionality: it must exist in con-
junction with an image of the future that it acts to block or help bring into
being. Any choice that does not refer in this way to the future is a mean-
ingless choice.
In the Newtonian picture the future does not exist in the present, and hence it
cannot enter into a present event or choice. Moreover, the future cannot be
changed by any event or choice.
But in the quantum ontology the future does exist objectively in the actual
present, albeit as potentia. Thus the future can enter into the present event.
This event can by altering the potentia for the future events, effectively block
or help bring into being a chosen state of affairs. In this sense a quantum
event can have effective intentionality and meaning.
(15)
Man in the Quantum Universe.
The role of man in the universe is tied to the mind-body problem. From the
perspective of the quantum ontology the brain is a macroscopic system
similar to a measuring device. The function of the brain is to organize input,
and then make a decision that initiates an appropriate action. According to
the brain-device analogy this decision is represented as a quantum jump.
Just as in the case of a measuring device, this quantum jump is a macroscopic
event: the whole brain, or some macroscopic part of it, is involved.
The problem of understanding, within the framework provided by classical
physics, the connection between consciousness and the physics of the brain
has been described in some quotations cited by William James: “The passage
from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is
unthinkable. Granted that a deﬁnite thought and a deﬁnite molecular action in
the brain occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ, nor
apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us to pass, by a
process of reasoning, from one to the other.” (Tyndall). Or
Suppose it to have become quite clear that a shock in consciousness and a molecular action
are the subjective and objective faces of the same thing; we continue utterly incapable of
uniting the two, so as to conceive that reality of which they are the opposite faces (Spencer).
The quantum ontology does have an analog of the classical motions of
molecules moving in accordance with Newton’s laws: it is the evolution of
the corresponding quantum operators in accordance with Heisenberg’s
equations. However, the quantum ontology has, also, something else, which
has no counterpart or analog in classical physics: the actual event. Within the
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2
137

quantum ontology the conscious event and the physical event can be natu-
rally understood as the psychological and physical faces of the same event,
namely the event of selecting and initiating a course of action. On the psy-
chological side there is the felt or conscious event of selecting and initiating
this action, and on the physical side there is the physical collapse of the
potentia, which selects and initiates this action: the physical brain, as rep-
resented in quantum mechanics, collapses to a state in which the instructions
that initiate the particular course of action are actualized.
The connection between these two events is not an ad hoc and arbitrary
identiﬁcation of things as totally disparate as, on the one hand, a motion of
billions of separate molecules, and, on the other hand, a uniﬁed conscious
act.
(16)
It is, rather, the association and identiﬁcation of the felt event with the
physical event that represents, within the quantum ontology, exactly the
change that is felt. In this way conscious events become special instances of
the actual events that, according to the quantum ontology, form the fabric of
the entire actual universe.
Conclusion
Quantum theory had several founders who had different opinions regarding
ontology. Hence it may not entail any speciﬁc ontology. However, the most rea-
sonable and well-deﬁned of the prominent quantum ontologies is, in my opinion,
the one that combines the claim of Heisenberg that we are dealing with a choice on
the part of the observer pertaining to which experiment will be performed, and the
claim of Dirac that we are dealing with a choice on the part of “nature” pertaining to
which response will be delivered, as formalized by von Neumann’s theory of
measurement, dubbed “orthodox” by Eugene Wigner. and in which the evolving
density matrix represents “potential”, expressed as probability for speciﬁed expe-
rienced response.
The chief features of the world that ﬂow from this ontology are:
1. It is nonlocal: there is some sort of nonseparability of spatially separated parts of
the universe.
2. It is creative: the ﬁxing of previously unsettled matters is a continuing process;
creativity did not expire with the birth of the universe.
3. It could be complete: no aspect of reality not represented within the quantum
ontology seems necessarily required.
4. It allows meaning: choices can have intentionality, hence meaning.
In everyone of these essential aspects the world-view provided by the quantum
ontology is the reverse of the one provided by pre-twentieth century science.
Consequently, modern science provides man with a vision of himself that is
138
Appendix G: Transcending Newton’s Legacy2

altogether different from, and far more inspirational and philosophically fertile than
the one proclaimed in the name of Newtonian science.
No longer is man reduced to a cog in a giant machine, an impotent witness to a
pre-ordained fate in some senseless charade. Rather, he appears, most naturally,
within the framework of present-day science, as an aspect of a fundamentally
nonseparable universe that is creation itself, both as noun and verb, a creative
process that unites in an intelligible way the mental and physical aspects of Nature,
and is moreover endowed in principle with the capacity to suffuse its evolving form
with meaning.
