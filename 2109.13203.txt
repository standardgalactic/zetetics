ABSTRACT
The current data acquisition rate of astronomical transient surveys and the promise for signiﬁcantly
higher rates in the next decade necessitate the development of novel approaches to analyze astronomical
data sets and promptly detect objects of interest. The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) program is a
survey focused on the identiﬁcation of fast evolving transients, such as fast radio bursts, gamma-ray
bursts, and supernova shock breakouts. It employs a multi-frequency simultaneous coverage of the
same part of the sky over several orders of magnitude.
Using the Dark Energy Camera mounted
on the 4-meter Blanco telescope, DWF captures a 20 second g-band exposure every minute, at a
typical seeing of ∼1′′ and an airmass of ∼1.5. These optical data are collected simultaneously with
observations conducted over the entire electromagnetic spectrum – from radio to γ-rays – as well as
cosmic ray observations. In this paper, we present a novel real-time light curve analysis algorithm,
designed to detect transients in the DWF optical data; this algorithm functions independently from,
or in conjunction with, image subtraction. We present a sample of fast transients detected by our
algorithm, as well as a false-positive analysis. Our algorithm is customizable and can be tuned to be
sensitive to transients evolving over diﬀerent timescales and ﬂux ranges.
1. INTRODUCTION
The ﬁeld of transient astronomy is booming, with several successful completed, ongoing, and planned optical surveys
that will come online in the coming years, speciﬁcally designed to ﬁnd transient phenomena. Among the former, the
Palomar Transient Factory/Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (PTF/iPTF, Rau et al. 2009; Law et al. 2009) the
Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS, Magnier et al. 2013), the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Supernova Survey (Wolf et al. 2016),the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) All-
sky Survey (Tonry et al. 2018), the Gaia Survey (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016),the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF,
Bellm et al. 2019; Graham et al. 2019) the Dark Energy Survey (DES, Dark Energy Survey Collaboration et al. 2016)
the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Kochanek et al. 2017) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS, Ricker et al. 2015) have provided a census of a large variety of supernovae (SNe), tidal-disruption
events, and exo-planet conﬁrmations. In the latter category, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman
Telescope will push our understanding of the transient sky towards deeper limits and longer wavelengths. An overview
of the ﬁeld of view (FoV), depth, and cadence of these surveys can be found in Table 1. In conjunction with some
of these optical surveys, gravitational wave (GW) detectors like the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-

wave Observatory (aLIGO, LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration et al. 2015) and Virgo (Acernese et al. 2015), and neutrino
detectors such as IceCube (IceCube Collaboration 2005) and the Baksan Neutrino Observatory (Kuzminov 2012) have
ushered us in a new era of multi-messenger transient astronomy.
We expect that the discovery of new and exciting transient phenomena will continue at higher pace thanks to the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory/Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST, Ivezić et al. 2019): the telescope is being
constructed in Cerro Pachón, Chile (with a planned ﬁrst light date in 2022 before commencing operations in 2023),
and aims to image the sky in Wide, Fast, Deep mode at a depth of g ∼24 every 3 days (LSST Science Collaboration
et al. 2017). The Nancy Grace Roman Telescope/Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST, Spergel et al. 2015)
will cover an area of 9 square degrees at an average depth of J ∼25 with a cadence of 5 days in a proposed medium
depth supernova survey when it is launched on its scheduled date in 2025 (Akeson et al. 2019; Hounsell et al. 2018).
We summarize the characteristics of these planned instruments in Table 1.
1.1. Current Survey Results
In this section we brieﬂy summarize some of the seminal discoveries that the next-generation of surveys will look to
build upon. For example, Pan-STARRS results include the outburst from a SN progenitor one year before its explosion
(Fraser et al. 2013), a lack of super-luminous SNe with light-curves compatible with pair-instability models (Nicholl
et al. 2013), and the ﬁrst interstellar asteroid detection (de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2017). Similarly,
the most recent SDSS survey results include the detection of baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements (Alam et al.
2017), evidence for the Epoch of Reionization around z ∼6 (Becker et al. 2001), high redshift (z > 5.6) quasars
(Fan et al. 2001), and indirect dark matter detection via weak-lensing (Fischer et al. 2000). And ﬁnally, in the recent
years PTF/iPTF/ZTF have further enhanced our knowledge on tidal disruptions events (TDEs, Hung et al. 2018; van
Velzen et al. 2021), gamma-ray burst (GRB) orphan afterglows (Cenko et al. 2015; Ho et al. 2020), and hosts of novel
SNe (Arcavi et al. 2010; Goobar et al. 2017; Kasliwal et al. 2010; Ofek et al. 2010; Horesh et al. 2012; Cao et al. 2013;
Ofek et al. 2013).
Due to the design of these facilities and their observational strategies, there is still a lack of discoveries of fast (≲1
hour) and faint (mg ≳21) transients (see Figure 3 right panel). There are several science cases that beneﬁt from the fast

identiﬁcation (and potential classiﬁcation) of rapidly varying transients with simultaneous observations spanning the
electromagnetic spectrum. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a class of objects characterized by either single, or repeating
radio bursts evolving on sub-second time scales; ﬁnding emission at frequencies other than radio is important toward
understanding the progenitors and ignition mechanism(s) for these events. The ﬁrst emission other than radio observed
to accompany an FRB was recently detected from a magnetar in the Milky Way at X-ray frequencies; although the
bursts are weaker in the radio than extragalactic FRBs, this event suggests that magnetars may be the progenitors of
at least some FRBs (Andersen et al. 2020; Bochenek et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2020).
Also, due to a lack of suﬃcient early time observations of SNe, the shock breakout mechanism for type Ia SNe and
the ignition mechanisms for core-collapse SNe (CC-SNe) are still not well understood. Type Ia SNe are critical for
determining cosmological distance scales, and are used to measure the accelerated expansion of the universe (Riess
et al. 1998). Despite their use as standard candles, the shock breakout mechanism for type Ia SNe is not conclusively
understood (Nomoto 1982). Identiﬁcation and follow-up of a type Ia SNe within the ﬁrst day, building on early-time
observations of Type Ia Supernovae by ZTF (Miller et al. 2020) and TESS (Fausnaugh et al. 2021), can lead to
an understanding of the shock breakout mechanism including the detection of a cooling tail, indicative of a delayed
detonation transition (Piro et al. 2010). More importantly, the nature and progenitors of SNe Ia is unclear. The
detection of UV/optical bursts from SNe Ia ejecta colliding with a companion star (e.g., Cao et al. 2015) helps
to secure the single-degenerate progenitor model for some fraction of events; these detections must occur on short
timescales. A better understanding of type Ia SNe could be the key towards resolving the more than 3σ discrepancy
between measurements of the Hubble Constant using the cosmic microwave background (e.g. by Planck, Hinshaw
et al. 2013; Planck Collaboration et al. 2020) and measurements made using the cosmic distance ladder method (e.g.,
Riess et al. 1998, 2016), on which type Ia SNe are a vital rung.
The study of CC-SNe is important in understanding the ends of the life cycles of massive stars and is believed to be
one of the drivers of nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron (Arnett & Clayton 1970), in addition to collapsars
Siegel et al. (2019).
Early detection and follow-up of CC-SNe can distinguish between various theorized ignition
mechanisms such as: magneto-rotational instabilities (Akiyama et al. 2003), standing accretion shocks (Blondin et al.
2003), acoustic shocks (Burrows et al. 2007), and QCD phase transitions (Sagert et al. 2009).
The ﬁrst GRB orphan afterglow may have been detected in the radio (Law et al. 2018), but was discovered at such
a late time after its prompt emission, that deep optical follow ups resulted in only upper limits. Searches are also
being performed by ZTF (Andreoni et al. 2020a; Ho et al. 2020) for orphan afterglows and kilonovae. One candidate
orphan afterglow (Coughlin et al. 2020) was later associated with prompt γ- and X-ray emission from GRB 201103B

Strausbaugh et al.
(Svinkin et al. 2020); the optical component was reported ﬁrst by ZTF, instilling conﬁdence in the veracity of their
method in detecting and identifying orphan afterglows. The study of orphan afterglows would allow us to calculate
GRB jet angles, as well as the true GRB rate (Rhoads 1997).
Although we have made many discoveries with surveys such as PTF, ZTF, and ASAS-SN, and plan on continued
success with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Roman Space Telescope, there is a void in the parameter
space for fast, faint transients that remains unﬁlled. Our understanding of GRB orphan afterglows, short GRBs, FRBs,
SN ignition mechanisms and shock-breakouts, and electro-magnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events can be
greatly enhanced by detecting these transients in real-time across several segments of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Due to the rarity of these events, the use of wide-ﬁeld facilities is needed.
In this paper we present an automated, customizable fast transient identiﬁcation algorithm centered mainly on
Deeper Wider Faster program (DWF) source light curve analysis. We summarize the DWF program in Section 2
and describe the DWF data sets analyzed in this work. In Section 3 we motivate the need for a transient detection
algorithm that is independent from image subtraction, and present the elements of a novel fast transient detection
algorithm. The results of running the algorithm on both real-time DWF data and later-time further processed data
sets is presented in Section 4. Finally in Section 5, we describe how this algorithm will be deployed in future DWF
runs and how it can be used with data from other surveys.
2. DEEPER, WIDER, FASTER PROGRAM
The Deeper, Wider, Faster program (DWF, Andreoni & Cooke 2019), is peculiar among all the aforementioned
transient surveys. The primary goal of DWF is to identify transient phenomena on the shortest timescales; DWF
searches from milliseconds to hours in various wavelengths. The deep optical component of DWF is carried out by the
Dark Energy Camera (DECam Honscheid & DePoy 2008) collecting 20s exposures in a 1 minute cadence, at g ∼23
magnitude limits, a wide-ﬁeld (∼3 deg2) of view (a comparison of DWF with other surveys can be found in Table
1). We note that the 1 minute cadence and 20s exposure times are due to overheads in ineﬃcient readout times. In
conjunction with optical observations carried out with DECam on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile, wide-ﬁeld ground-
and space-based observatories spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum are coordinated either to simultaneously
collect data on the same region of the sky, or coordinated to trigger rapid (or later-time) follow-up of transient sources.
The DWF program is carried out for one week twice annually. Data collected by DECam for real-time analysis is
highly compressed (Vohl et al. 2017), to minimize transfer speed, and sent directly from the summit on Cerro Tololo,
Chile to the OzSTAR supercomputer at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia for processing and analysis.
In addition, these data are also transferred using lossless compression and fully processed by a modiﬁed version of the
photpipe NOAO Community Pipeline (Rest et al. 2005; Swaters & Valdes 2007; Valdes & Swaters 2007) at a later
time.
The DWF program, like many other transient surveys (e.g., PTF and SN Legacy Survey, among others, Cao et al.
2016; Perrett et al. 2010), relies on an image subtraction pipeline (Mary pipeline, Andreoni et al. 2017) to detect
potential sources of interest in real time. A ranked list of candidates is presented to astronomers and volunteers for
further visual inspection of image cutouts (small fraction of the DECam FoV centered on a single detected source)
and light curves using the interactive tools described in Meade et al. (2017).
2.1. DWF Data Samples
Here, we describe the DWF data stream in more detail, the light curve creation process, and the ﬁnal inputs that
will be fed into the transient identiﬁcation algorithm. The data collected by DECam for the DWF program is unique
among transient surveys in its cadence, and therefore oﬀers the potential for "ﬁrst of their kind" discoveries. For
DWF, the 4-meter Blanco telescope, on which DECam is mounted, collects continuous 20s exposures at ∼1 minute
cadence, when including readout time. In each 20s exposure, DECam reaches a depth of g ∼23 under normal DWF
observing conditions, ∼1.0 arcsecond seeing at ∼1.5 airmass. The slightly higher than ideal airmass is due to the
visibility requirements for simultaneous observations in the radio, conducted by telescopes in either Australia or South
Africa, and telescopes operating at other wavelengths in the Antarctic, North America, and other locations, including
space-based telescopes.
The g-band is selected as the main observing band for DWF as DECam sensitivity is ∼0.5 magnitudes deeper than
in redder ﬁlters, many fast bursts are hot and blue, and DWF target ﬁelds are typically at low Galactic extinction.
Most DWF target ﬁelds have template reference images taken prior to the run in multiple ﬁlters. In addition, and if

there are no reference images (i.e., for newly discovered FRB or short-GRB ﬁelds), the target ﬁelds are observed either
at the start or end of the night (or both) in other ﬁlters, typically r- and i-bands to determine source colors.
The DWF program collects data with DECam over a ∼3 deg2 FoV. This wide-ﬁeld is covered by the 62 individual
DECam CCDs. The data from each CCD is saved as an extension in a multi-extension ﬁts ﬁle. These data are
processed and analyzed in two ways.
Firstly, for real-time, or fast analysis, the image ﬁles are ‘lossy’, compressed at the summit using the method described
in Vohl et al. (2017), and sent to OzSTAR supercomputer at Swinburne University of Technology for data analysis.
Data transfer from the Cerro Tololo summit in Chile to Australia is too slow to enable data processing, analysis,
and transient candidate identiﬁcation within minutes, which is necessary for fast transients. The lossy compression is
tunable to the speed of the internet and can speed up transfer by compressing the data up to ∼20× and still enable
detection of ∼95% of the transients. Furthermore, to enable fast identiﬁcation and rapid response follow-up triggers,
these data are ‘fast’ processed in parallel on the OzSTAR supercomputer. The fast processing sacriﬁces some aspects
of a full processing pipeline for speed. Both the lossy compression and the fast processing result in several artifacts in
the images that are not typically observed in conventional transient pipeline analyses.
The real-time data processing for the data collected on the dates used in this work includes using Swarp (Bertin et al.
2002) to align and stack images, SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to identify sources, and HOTPANTS (Becker
2015) to perform image subtractions. After performing image subtraction and source extraction on the diﬀerenced
images, the Mary pipeline (Andreoni et al. 2017) runs a machine learning algorithm on the potential candidates to
minimize CCD artifacts. Aperture photometry of one full-width half-max was forced on the coordinates of sources
that contained a residual following an image subtraction. The remaining candidates are then ranked based on their
presence in The Second-Generation Guide Star Catalog (GSC-II, Lasker et al. 2008) and in previous nights of the
DWF run, with higher rankings given to those sources that are present in neither GSC-II, nor previous DWF nights.
Data analyzed in this manner will be referred to as “real-time” data. We note that the real-time processing is diﬀerent
for later runs.
Secondly, the data are separately sent to the NOAO High-Performance Pipeline System (Swaters & Valdes 2007;
Valdes & Swaters 2007) to provide post-run, fully processed and well-calibrated data for later-time analyses. These
data are used for fast transient detection after burst, fast transient searches cross-matched with other wavelengths,
fast transients associated with slower-evolving events (e.g., supernova shock breakouts), slower-evolving events caught
early by DWF, and other applications. For the data used here, sources were identiﬁed using SExtractor and the images
are not stacked, nor image subtracted, however. Automatically calculated apertures were forced on the coordinates of
all sources 1.5σ greater than the background. Magnitudes from SExtractor identiﬁed sources are calibrated against
the SkyMapper Data Release 2 catalogue (Onken et al. 2019). Data analyzed in this manner will be referred to as
“post-run” data.
For both real-time and post-run data processing methods, the light curves are generated for sources that have one
or more detections at the same coordinates using aperture photometry on non-subtracted images; DWF targets are
named using these coordinates. For each DWF source, a data point or upper limit is generated every ∼1 minute,
unless the source location falls oﬀthe CCD, either in chip gaps or oﬀthe edge of DECam FoV as a result of small
oﬀsets in guiding, tracking, and hexapod tip-tile corrections, as a result of changing weather, moving to a new ﬁeld,
etc.
There are a total of 5 DWF ﬁelds analyzed in this work, shown in Table 2. There are 2 “real-time” data sets covering
the CDFS Legacy and FRB171019 ﬁelds. There are 5 “post-run” data sets covering two epochs on the 4-hour and
Antlia ﬁelds and one epoch on the FRB010724 ﬁeld. The two 4-hour and Antlia epochs analyzed here are from two
separate runs, spaced 11 months and 16 months apart, respectively; this second pointing can help establish if there is
any recurrence or periodicity to transient behavior observed.
The 4-hour ﬁeld is one of the ﬁrst ﬁelds observed by DWF. The ﬁrst DWF run employed an observational routine
with dithering. Analyzing the ﬁrst run on the 4-hour ﬁeld can determine how robust our algorithm is to dithered data;
subsequent DWF runs have moved away from the dithered approach due to confounding issues discussed in Section
4.1. The Antlia ﬁeld was chosen for analysis, in part because comparisons can be drawn between this work, and work
done in Webb et al. (2020). The FRB010724 data is from a dense ﬁeld with 839,729 light curves generated over 5 days.
The two “real-time” ﬁelds were chosen out of necessity; older “real-time” data was not stored for later analysis, and
the COVID-19 pandemic, which has halted operations for many observing sites across the world, had precluded the
acquisition of “real-time” data sets from Cerro Tololo for several months. The results of running the Fast Transient

(DEC) in sexagesimal coordinates as follows: DWFRADEC.
2.2. Challenges of Detecting and Studying Fast Transients
The challenges of “big-data” in astronomy have been well documented (e.g., Feigelson & Babu 2012; Zhang & Zhao
2015; Kremer et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2015). As seen in Table 1, the cadence of many optical transient surveys allows for
longer processing times, but could limit the speed with which astronomers detect transient phenomena, with potential
delays of several days between the start of an event and its detection. DWF oﬀers a diﬀerent approach to other
optical surveys, and presents new challenges to analyze incoming data in “real-time”. The real-time, fast processing
by DWF (described in Section 2.1) is by no means ideal or optimal; the lossy compression adds artifacts and the
fast data processing is much poorer than normal processing, creating additional artifacts and poorer astrometry and
alignments, which can yield poorer subtractions. This sub-optimal fast processing is necessary, however, in order to
identify events and trigger follow-up before sources fade. Detailed follow-up of these events, ideally spectra, can shed
light on the early phases of SNe, GRB afterglows, potential FRB optical counterparts, and other transient phenomena.
The challenges outlined here are unique to DWF due to the fast cadence and the opportunity for transient detection
on minute time-scales. It is these challenges that motivate the work presented here.
3. ALGORITHM FOR EARLY SOURCE DETECTION
Despite its ubiquity, the use of image subtraction techniques to identify transient sources is wrought with challenges.
The convolution of point spread functions between images can be challenging, if not impossible between diﬀerent
instruments and diﬀerent seeing conditions; even when feasible, convolution can be computationally intensive. Source
extraction codes (or the astronomers interpreting their outputs) can be fooled by sources that are not real, for example
cosmic rays, cross-talk on images, or mis-aligned subtractions. As surveys search for transients to fainter magnitudes,
they begin to hit the noise/source threshold and many detections are too ambiguous to accurately identify. The very
large number of source detections in image subtracted frames and the inability to have humans analyze them all in a
reasonable time frame (especially for fast transients), or do so with any solid accuracy to trigger followup observations,
necessitates the use of machine learning frameworks to identify false-positives (Masci et al. 2017; Díaz et al. 2016;
Duev et al. 2019), further complicating the process and increasing computational demands.
Furthermore, the machine-learning (ML) approach requires extensive training and large training set samples (typ-
ically in the hundreds of thousands of images), increasing the demands on human time and capital. The challenges
associated with image subtraction have led to attempts to identify transient sources through direct image comparisons
(Wardęga et al. 2020) and light curve analysis (e.g., Wevers et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2020; Webb et al. 2020).
In addition, deﬁnitive source classiﬁcation is hardly possible with image subtraction alone: transient characterization
is conﬁrmed through follow-up observations, including spectroscopic data; however, telescope time using sensitive
spectroscopic instruments is very limited, and the time-window for observing fast-fading sources is narrower than the

Fast Transient Finding Algorithm
7
cadence of conventional transient surveys. If enough data of the source is rapidly available for a light curve to be made
(e.g. within a few minutes of the ﬁrst data acquisition), preliminary classiﬁcation can be performed, using simple
metrics such as its rise and/or decay rate and peak brightness. This early classiﬁcation using light curves can inform
astronomers about the resources they should allocate to these targets which are always limited; this kind of observation
strategy will be crucial for LSST, and is the service that brokers will be performing for the community (Förster et al.
2020; Narayan et al. 2018; Narayan et al. 2018; Smith 2019; Patterson et al. 2019; Möller et al. 2021). With better
sampling, including light curves spanning multiple wavelength bands, a more precise classiﬁcation of sources can be
achieved (Bloom et al. 2012; Ball et al. 2006; Debosscher et al. 2007; Richards et al. 2011; Kim & Bailer-Jones 2016;
Jamal & Bloom 2020), but progress on this front is still minimal due to the complexity of the data and classiﬁcation
algorithms.
3.1. Fast Transient Finding (FTF) Algorithm
Given the obstacles inherent in using image subtraction techniques, and the necessity of a light curve analysis to
classify peculiar transient events, we propose to identify these transient phenomena with a direct light curve analysis of
the DWF data stream. The algorithm we describe can be used as an independent veriﬁcation for candidates detected
via other methods (e.g. image subtraction, machine learning algorithms); a ﬂow chart of the FTF algorithm is shown
in Figure 2.
Figure 2. For a given DWF ﬁeld, a total number of N sources are detected. A light curve (LC) will be generated for each
source during post-run processing, or in real-time for those sources identiﬁed as potential transients from image subtraction (see
Section 2.1 for a thorough discussion of the diﬀerent data types). Each LC is fed into the algorithm described in Section 3.1 in
a parallel-processed manner. The LCs are separated into n −(SW −1) diﬀerent sliding windows, where n is the number of data
points in the LC and SW is the size of the sliding window. Each of these sliding windows are processed in parallel, ﬁt linearly,
and the sign of the slope is determined: positive, negative, or ﬂat. The signs from the slopes of the individual sliding windows
is recombined and the number of inﬂection points (IPs) in the LC is counted. Those LCs with fewer than 5 IPs are saved as
potential transients.
For each unique source observed during the DWF run, we separate the light curve data using a sliding window (SW),
a technique common in ﬁnancial time series analysis (Chou & Nguyen 2018; Chou & Truong 2019; Karathanasopoulos
et al. 2016) as well as machine learning applications across several disciplines (Dietterich 2002; Kaneda & Mineno
2016; Selvin et al. 2017; Helwan & Uzun Ozsahin 2017). The user can deﬁne the size of the sliding window parameter,
but is limited by the number of data points contained within an individual light curve ﬁle (light curves may have
missing points due to changing weather conditions, upper limits, or artifacts that prevent our photometric pipeline to
accurately estimate the magnitude of the source). The source code for the FTF algorithm is publicly available1.

Figure 3. Amalgamated histogram of the number of data points present in each light curve for all of the ﬁelds and runs
analyzed in this work in both the real-time data (left) and post-run processed data (right) sets. The red dashed line is plotted
at 5, the chosen sliding window size in the FTF algorithm explored in this paper; the sliding window parameter can be changed
to search for transients evolving on diﬀerent time scales.
3.2. Statistical Selection of Algorithm Parameters
Based on the typical ﬁeld cadence and the number of points per light curve we can assess the best SW size.
We emphasize here that, while we focus in this paper on ﬁnding known categories of fast evolving transients (e.g.,
GRB afterglows, kilonovae, etc.) the FTF algorithm can be easily customized for diﬀerent or novel types of variable
phenomena by changing the sliding window size (Figure 3) and the slope threshold (Figure 4); searches for new types
of fast-evolving transients is an important focus of DWF and we will us the FTF to pursue these targets in the future.
In Figure 3, we present the histograms of the number of data points present in each light curve for all of the ﬁelds and
runs analyzed in this work, for both the “real-time” and “post-run” data. The data points for both the real-time and
post-run are generated by forced photometry. In the real-time data, aperture photometry of one full-width half-max
was forced on the coordinates of sources that contained a residual following an image subtraction. In the post-run data,
automatically calculated apertures were forced on the coordinates of all sources 1.5σ greater than the background.
The red dashed line in Figure 3 represents our choice of a SW=5; this avoids the predominance of noisy light curves
(SW ≪5) and mitigates the risk of averaging over rapidly rising and falling light curves or ﬂares with larger windows
(SW ≫5).
Over each sliding window, we compute a simple linear ﬁt, g = αt + g0 (where g is the observed magnitude, t is the
time in minutes from the ﬁrst observation, α is the temporal decay index, and g0 is the intercept), and return the
slope and its uncertainty. We do not perform our ﬁt using uncertainties in the photometry for reasons of eﬃciency.
A histogram of the slopes of each window from real-time and post-processed ﬁelds is plotted in the two graphs in
Figure 4. We ﬁnd that the distributions of slopes is well-modeled with a Laplace Distribution, represented by the
probability density function
P(x) = 1
2b exp
|x −µ|
b

(1)
where µ is the mean (which, in the case of this function is equal to the median as well as the mode), the variance is
2b2, and the average absolute deviation is b. From the linear ﬁts, we obtain the sign of each window slope as positive,
negative, or ﬂat; we consider a ﬂat (non-changing) slope if α = 0 ± b, as shown by the red dashed lines in Figure 4.
The algorithm keeps track of the sign of the slope over each sliding window and notes a change in the sign of the
slope as an inﬂection point (IP). Scanning over each sliding window, the algorithm tallies and records the number of
IPs. For example, a typical fast previously unknown transient may have a number of IPs between 0 (straight rising or
decay behavior) and 3 (e.g. a ﬂare with one IP rising, one IP fading, and one IP ﬂat).
The aforementioned process is time consuming and CPU-intensive. Since our ultimate goal is to provide real-time
identiﬁcation of fast transients from the DWF data stream we implement a full parallelization of our python-based
algorithm; each target can be run independently and in parallel during the DWF run. This parallelization enables the
code to run over each DWF source in ≲1 minute, on par with the cadence of incoming data points. The eﬃciency

of the code is important for real-time identiﬁcation of transients, especially deployed on multi-core CPUs, like the
supercomputer at Swinburne University, where the optical data from DWF runs is analyzed.
3.3. Phenomenological Selection of Number of Inﬂection Points
For each light curve we calculate the number of IPs and then we group all objects and light curves with the same
number of IPs. For this work, we focus on light curves that have four or fewer IPs within the typical DWF light curve
(∼1 hour).
• Light curves with zero IPs, but that are monotonically increasing or decreasing could be longer evolving transients:
Cepheids, RR Lyrae, or SNe, for example. These could also be the beginning a of fast evolving transient at the
end of DWF observation.
• Light curves with one IP might be catching the start of the rise or fall of a transient evolving on minutes to days
time scales.
• Light curves with two or three IPs may contain peaks or dips spanning the entire DWF time on the ﬁeld (typically
1-4 hours).
• Four IP light curves could point towards more complex behavior that goes through several phases over the course
of the DWF observation.
It is important to note that transient phenomena may be occurring before the DWF run began, or continue after
data acquisition has stopped. Therefore, a burst like event might only have two or three IPs, as its light curve might
be shifted towards the beginning or end of a run in such a way that some parts of the curve are not sampled.
For the FTF algorithm, we deﬁne “fast transient” candidates as those with fewer than four inﬂections points, and
with at least one sliding window with a slope greater than a user speciﬁed slope; in this iteration of the algorithm,
that speciﬁc slope is deﬁned by statistical measures as deﬁned in Section 3.2, but could be set manually by the user if
searching for a speciﬁc type of source with a known range of slopes. The code could be modiﬁed to include sources with
more than four inﬂection points points towards a variable source that could be of interest to other areas of astronomy.
Using this algorithm, the ﬁrst potential transients can be reported just after the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of observation
by DWF; thereafter the number of IPs associated with each light curve will be updated every minute, as the sliding
window shifts over by one data point. A noted inﬂection change with a corresponding positive detection in the image
subtraction pipeline provides good evidence to trigger imaging and spectroscopic follow-up.
3.4. FTF Algorithm Demonstration

Strausbaugh et al.
In Figure 5 we show how the FTF algorithm works on a sample light curve, using a ﬂaring star ﬁrst detected in
Webb et al. (2020) as an example. The light curve for this ﬂaring source, DWF102955.559-360035.170, is plotted in
the left panel of Figure 5. The right panel in Figure 5 shows the slope derived from each sliding window as function
of time. We can clearly see that the ﬂare in the light curve and the relative inﬂection points enable the identiﬁcation
of a change in brightness beyond the typical brightness. While this information may be used to trigger follow up
observations, the subsequent data demonstrate that there are more inﬂection points and therefore the source is not a
fast transient as classiﬁed in Section 3.3. The dashed red lines in the ﬁgure represent the same thresholds identiﬁed in
the histograms presented in Figure 4; users can set a diﬀerent threshold to identify diﬀerent transients of interest, as
shown by the blue dashed lines.

was ﬁrst discovered using unsupervised learning techniques in Webb et al. (2020). Right: The slope of each sliding window is
plotted over time. The red dashed line correspond to the b-term derived from the Laplace Distribution, as deﬁned in Equation
1 and plotted in Figure 4. The blue dashed line represents a more restrictive parameter that can be tuned in the algorithm if
for example, astronomers are looking speciﬁcally for ﬂare stars.
4. RESULTS
In this section we present the outcome of our FTF algorithm and the implication on 1) detectability of fast transients
of diﬀerent natures and the rate of detection of these objects compared to other surveys and 2) the required eﬀort for
spectroscopic follow-up for secure classiﬁcation. In summary:
• On a single night of observation on a single ﬁeld we obtained on average ∼50, 000 real-time light curves, and
∼340, 000 post-processed light curves.
• Feeding these 50, 000 real-time and 340, 000 post-processed light curves into the FTF algorithm, we detect, on
average 150 (∼3%) and 3, 000 (≲1%) potential fast transients respectively.
• Checking the science frames of the potential fast transients for artifacts and other non-astronomical sources, we
obtained on average, 1 statistically signiﬁcant fast transient per ﬁeld in the real-time data, and 13 statistically
signiﬁcant fast transients per ﬁeld in the post-processed data.
• Based on light curve ﬁts 69 sources can be classiﬁed as “potential transients” under our deﬁnition in Section 3.1
from the ﬁelds described in Table 2.
• In the event of a fast transient identiﬁcation, FTF would allow a latency time of just 5-15 minutes for multi-
wavelength and spectroscopic follow-up observations.
A detailed break-down of the results over each ﬁeld can be found in Table 3. We note that the 69 sources identiﬁed
as “potential transients” are fast evolving sources that would require follow-up, speciﬁcally spectroscopic follow-up to
determine if these sources are indeed transients or other variable sources.

Note—The FTF algorithm identiﬁed ≈1% of the light curves in the ﬁelds
studied as potential transients, reducing the number of real-time light
curves that require human inspection by two orders of magnitude. From
those light curves identiﬁed by the algorithm, about 0.5% are identiﬁed
by a human observer as potentially real astrophysical phenomena, after
rejecting sources with obvious non-astrophysical explanations. Fields with
an * denote ﬁelds where real-time data was analyzed.
4.1. Results on Real-Time and Post-Run Data
Once a list of candidates is generated using the FTF algorithm (within the ﬁrst 5-10 minutes of the run, and then
every minute thereafter), as shown in Section 3.4, light curves are vetted by our team; for those light curves that
passed human inspection, image cutouts for the source’s location on the sky were visually inspected to exclude the
presence of artifacts that survived our processing pipeline (e.g., cosmic rays, bad pixels, bad rows/columns, etc.).
For the purposes of this paper, a positive detection is deﬁned as one where the source is either a known variable, a
DWF variable detected by other methods (see for example, Webb et al. 2020), or a newly discovered candidate that
passes a visual inspection of the images associated with the light curves. To conﬁrm known variables, we checked the
coordinates of our candidates against known variable source catalogs such as the General Catalog of Variable Stars
(Samus’ et al. 2017) and the International Variable Star Index (Watson et al. 2017).
It is important to note that the real-time light curves will only exist for those sources that were candidates identiﬁed
via image subtraction as a part of the Mary pipeline analysis; in contrast, the light curves from the post-run processing
with the NOAO pipeline encompasses all sources that were detected during the run. The sources in both real-time
and post-run data sets include point sources and extended sources. The linear ﬁts plotted in the subsequent ﬁgures
(Figures 6-10) are meant to give an idea of the general trends in the lights curves, and are not the slopes associated
with the sliding windows, as shown in Section 3.4, nor are they necessarily the best ﬁt for the data.
The light curve of DWF011805.113-751125.458, plotted in the left panel of Figure 6 is a known RR Lyrae source,
called BG Tuc (Hoﬀmeister 1963; Geßner 1981). The light curves of DWF011805.113-751125.458 for each night of the
DWF observing run are plotted in the right panel of Figure 6; this ﬁgure shows the variability of the object over long
time scales.
The behavior of DWF102920.187-355700.211 on both the night of 180607, plotted in the upper left and panel of
Figure 7, and 1800608, plotted in the upper right panel of Figure 7, were identiﬁed by the FTF algorithm as potential
transient phenomena. The ﬁrst night of data shows a source decreasing from g ∼17.6 to g ∼18.4 in 30 minutes of
observation. The data from the second night shows a source with a baseline magnitude of g ∼20 that dips dramatically,
twice: once by 2 magnitudes and a second time by 1.5 magnitudes, each occurring in the space of a few minutes. Visual
inspection of the ﬁrst night of data revealed no signs of contamination by non-astrophysical sources. The analysis of
the data from the second night, shown in the bottom panel of Figure 7, reveals that DWF102920.187-355700.211 and
the dimmer stars in the vicinity all become very faint; clouds passing over this region of the sky would account for
the apparent dimming of the source during the second night, if the clouds passed over this region of the sky and not
the region containing reference stars for the ﬁeld. We believe that DWF102920.187-355700.211 was displaying some

genuine transient phenomena on the ﬁrst night of observation before reaching a quiescent phase in the second and
third nights.
In Figure 8, we present two light curves that showcase when the FTF can identify a fast evolving transient in the
DWF “real-time” data stream, and how quickly astronomers can trigger other resources. The left panel shows the
source DWF040623.456-550041.171 around g ∼17 before dropping by 0.7 magnitudes over a 10 minute period. For
a source like this, the FTF algorithm would alert astronomers within the ﬁrst few data points (within 10 minutes
in the case) after the light curve deviates from a ﬂat position. The right panel of Figure 8 shows the light curve of
DWF102613.233-350150.332 rising by about 0.8 magnitudes in 40 minutes, before undergoing a seemingly exponential
decay over the remainder of the observations. This source would be identiﬁed as a potential transient after the ﬁrst 5
data points, due to the steep nature of its increasing brightness. Furthermore, the FTF algorithm would identify an
inﬂection point within 10 minutes of the object’s drop in brightness, notifying astronomers of a change in the behavior
of this object.
4.2. Transient Misidentiﬁcation
In this section we present a sample of light curves that were identiﬁed as possible transients by the FTF algorithm,
but after further analysis, were determined to be bogus. The most common type of light curve that confounded the
FTF algorithm were those involving an astronomical source interacting with the edge of one of the 62 science CCDs
that make up the DECam detector (Honscheid & DePoy 2008), pictured in Figure 1 under the label DES (Dark Energy
Survey); the number of CCDs increases the chance for edge interactions. As the source moves onto or oﬀof a CCD
the light curve can show a peak or a dip not unlike that mimicking a fast rising or fading transient. This eﬀect was
exacerbated by early DWF observational strategies employing dithering routine (e.g., the ﬁrst run on the 4-hour ﬁeld
analyzed in this paper); dithering patterns are no longer favored by DWF, in part for this reason. This issue can be
remedied by ignoring data collected near the edge of a detector. This information is not always available in cataloged
data sets, but can be easily identiﬁed using software analyzing the dimensions of the science image (i.e. is it square?)
and by machine learning algorithms.
In Figure 9, we present an example of an astronomical source DWF040903.800-554603.567 appearing to exhibit
transient behavior.
In the left panel of Figure 9, the light curve dims by > 0.1 magnitude in one minute before
continuing to decay over the next ﬁve minutes. Upon visual inspection of the ﬁts images (in the right panel of Figure
9, it is clear that the telescope shifted slightly, placing the source on the edge of the detector, and afterwards, the
sources is slowly moving out of frame.
In Figure 10, we present a light curve that was misidentiﬁed as a transient due to edge eﬀects, but for a slightly dif-
ferent reason than that shown in Figure 9. In the left panel of Figure 10, we present the light curve of DWF040748.870-
541956.717 that appears at a magnitude of g ≈19.7 out of a 5σ background upper limit of g < 22.5. The source then
proceeds to decay by 0.6 magnitudes over the course of about 7 minutes. Upon inspection of the images, shown in the

be contamination from non-astrophysical eﬀects in the image cutouts from this night of data, so we identify this source as real.
Top Right: The light curves for the other nights for which this source is observed. Overall, the source is declining form g ∼17.5

are presented. As can be seen in one of the middle rows, the source and those nearby all seem to fade, indicative of clouds that
may not have been visible to the astronomers on the ground.
right panel of Figure 10, a bright source is shown moving out of frame. We suspect that the cause of the appearance of
the source at g ≈19.7 more than 50 minutes after the observation of the ﬁeld began is the following: 1) a bright star
was present in the ﬁeld at coordinates slightly oﬀset from those of DWF040748.870-541956.717, 2) this bright source
began to move out of frame, 3) eventually the centroid of the star is out of frame, but light from the star is still being
detected; the NOAO pipeline then identiﬁes a new source using coordinates in frame 4) as the source continues to
move out of frame, the brightness of the object continues to decrease.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The Deeper, Wider, Faster program is unique in terms of its depth (g ∼23 per image) and its short cadence (∼
1 minute) when compared to other transient surveys, occupying a parameter space with a distinct lack of coverage
(e.g., Andreoni et al. 2020b, Figure 6).
In addition to its depth and cadence, DWF oﬀers a new way to explore
transient phenomena due to the simultaneous wide-ﬁeld multi-wavelength observations performed across the entire
electromagnetic spectrum. Identiﬁcation of transient phenomena in transient surveys has heavily relied on the imperfect
science of image subtraction. Image subtraction is necessary in some cases, such as the identiﬁcation of a transient
within a bright host galaxy. Identiﬁcation of transients via light curve analysis, can be done independently from image

Strausbaugh et al.
Figure 8. Left: The light curve of DWF040623.456-550041.171 is presented. The ﬁrst 10 data points in the light curve are
consistent with the ﬂat slope deﬁned in Section 3.1. The source then dims by 0.8 mangitudes in about 10 minutes. After the
ﬁrst data point in this decay, the FTF algorithm will note this object as a potential fast transient. Right: The light curve of
DWF102613.233-350150.332 is presented. The ﬁrst 5 data points in this light curve would indicate this object as a potential
fast transient. The light curve then enters into a period of seemingly exponential decay for the remainder of observation. The
algorithm would detect this inﬂection change, again alerting astronomers about the potential transient nature of this source. In
both cases present in this ﬁgure, the FTF algorithm can alert astronomers within 5-10 minutes of the transient behavior.

subtraction, or in concert with image subtraction techniques. Light curve analysis can identify variable objects with
small changes in brightness that might be missed in an image subtraction, for example exoplanet transits. In addition,
the rudimentary classiﬁcation of transient phenomena requires analysis of the light curves of these objects, with more
reﬁned classiﬁcations relying heavily on a spectral analysis of the object.
In this work, we present the Fast Transient Finding (FTF) algorithm, capable of identifying transient phenomena
both independently of image subtraction (e.g., “Post-run Data” in Section 4.1, and in tandem with an image subtraction
algorithm (e.g., “Real-Time Data” in Section 4.1 and the ∗ﬁelds in Table 3), on the DWF data stream light curves.
We focused on identifying fast transients (e.g., explosive phenomena) in this paper, but also demonstrate how the FTF
algorithm can be customized to ﬁnd other kinds transients and variables.
This type of algorithm occupies a unique space within the transient detection landscape. Most currently operating
optical surveys do not detect intra-night variability, and as such, miss the opportunity to alert the community for
possible follow-up on fast evolving transients such as GRB and FRB counterparts.

on the position of DWF040748.870-541956.717 on the sky. Upon further inspection, it appears that a bright source is on the
edge of the CCD; as it moves further oﬀthe edge, a small section of the star is still visible. This small bit of ﬂux is assigned to
coordinates still in the ﬁeld of view of this CCD, and a new source is generated in the catalog. As the source continues to move
oﬀthe CCD, the measured ﬂux decreases.
Figure 11. Current data ﬂow for incorporation of the FTF algorithm into the DWF pipeline. The green arrows represent the
new data ﬂows described in this paper. Data from DECam are compressed (Vohl et al. 2017) and sent to Australia for analysis.
The images are processed by the Mary Pipeline (Andreoni et al. 2017) and image subtractions are performed. Light curves of
sources ﬂagged through image subtraction are fed to the FTF algorithm. The light curves are analyzed and the results are fed
to the Data Visualization (e.g., Meade et al. 2017), or used directly to trigger follow-up observations.
We see the work in this paper as the ﬁrst step towards implementation of real time transient classiﬁcation. We
will ﬁrst identify potential transients using the FTF algorithm. Next we will combine the multi-wavelength data sets
obtained by the DWF for sources of interest. We will either extract features from this combined multi-frequency data
set or run a deep learning classiﬁcation algorithm in real-time (Cucchiara et al. in preparation).
The FTF algorithm will be incorporated into the DWF pipeline and deployed on the next DWF run, as shown
in Figure 11.
In its ﬁrst iterations the algorithm will be working oﬀof the light curves generated by the image
subtractions performed by the Mary pipeline (Andreoni et al. 2017). When a source is ﬁrst identiﬁed as a candidate
by image subtraction, a light curve will begin to be populated for that source. If the slope of the light curve of that
source is above some threshold, which we can select manually for speciﬁc sources (very high for ﬂare stars or slightly
lower for slower evolving transients) or automatically using a statistical measure (e.g. Figure 4), then that source will
be identiﬁed as a potential fast transient candidate. Candidates from the image subtraction are provided to human
observers using interactive visualization tools. We will give priority to sources that are ﬂagged as potential transients
by the FTF algorithm, as these sources are both image-subtracted candidates and FTF candidates. As more data is
generated, sources with more inﬂection points will drop out of the FTF candidate list. We can trigger followup of
image subtracted and FTF candidates to classify these sources in real-time (e.g. with detailed spectra).
Due to the general nature of the FTF algorithm, we will look to apply it to other data sets, both propreitary and
publicly available. In particular, some authors of this paper are members of the Rubin Science Collaboration or are
