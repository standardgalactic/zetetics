Interpretation: In the progressive income tax proposed by Graslin in 1767, the effective tax rate ­rose 
gradually from 5 ­percent on an annual income of 150 livres tournois (roughly half the average income of the 
time) to 75 ­percent on an income of 400,000 livres (roughly 1,300 times the average). Lacoste’s proposed 
progressive inheritance tax exhibits similar progressivity.

1 ­percent of fortunes, the share of financial assets ­rose to 66 ­percent (of which 25 ­percent ­were foreign).

Interpretation: The number of slaves in the United States qua­dru­pled between 1800 and 1860 (from 880,000 to nearly 3.95 million) while the slave share of 
the population in the South remained fairly stable (at about one-­third). The slave share of total population declined (owing to the even more rapid growth of the 
population in the North). Note: All slave states as of 1860 are classified as Southern: Alabama, Arkansas, North and South Carolina, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mary­land, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, and ­Virginia. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.

Muslims fell from 24 ­percent in 1941 to 10 ­percent in 1951 owing to the partition of Pakistan and Bangladesh. From 1951 on, the censuses recorded “scheduled castes” (SC) and “scheduled

Vaishyas (Banyas) (artisans, merchants) and Kayasths (writers, accountants). Other local high castes such as Marathas

with 56 ­percent on average for all voters) and 67 ­percent said that one must take from the rich and give to the poor (compared with 51 ­percent on average). This was 
ideologically the “egalitarian internationalist” (pro-­immigrant, pro-­poor) vote, where Macron’s electorate was “inegalitarian internationalist,” Fillon’s was “inegalitarian nativist” 
(anti-­immigrant, pro-­rich), and that of Le Pen / Dupont-­Aignan was “egalitarian nativist” (anti-­immigrant, pro-­poor). Note: The votes for Arthaud / Poutou (2 ­percent) and 
Asselineau / Cheminade / Lassalle (2 ­percent) ­were added to the votes for Melenchon / Hamon and Fillon respectively. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.

Interpretation: The proposed tax system includes a progressive tax on property (annual tax + inheritance 
tax) financing a capital endowment for each young adult and a progressive income tax (including social 
contributions and a progressive tax on carbon emissions) financing the basic income and the social and 
ecological state (health, education, pensions, unemployment, energy, ­etc.). This system of circulating 
property is one of the constituent ele­ments of participatory socialism, with voting rights on corporate 
boards shared fifty-­fifty between workers and stockholders. Note: In the example shown ­here, the progressive 
tax on property brings in roughly 5 ­percent of national income (allowing a capital endowment equivalent to 
60 ­percent of the average wealth at age 25) while the progressive income tax brings in roughly 45 ­percent of 
national income (allowing an annual basic income equivalent to 60 ­percent of average income ­after 
taxes—5 ­percent of national income) and the social and ecological state (40 ­percent of national income).

Interpretation: ­Under the proposed organ­ization, the treaties regulating globalization (circulation of 
goods, capital, and ­people) ­will henceforth provide for the states and regional ­unions concerned to create a 
transnational assembly in charge of global public goods (climate, research, ­etc.) and global fiscal justice 
(common taxes on the largest fortunes, highest incomes, largest firms, and carbon taxes). Note: Countries A, 
B, C, and D may be states like France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and so on, in which case the transnational 
assembly would be the Eu­ro­pean Assembly, or they could be regional ­unions like the Eu­ro­pean Union, the 
African Union, and so on, in which case the transnational assembly would be the Euro-­African Assembly. 
The transnational assembly may consist of deputies of national assemblies and / or transnational deputies 
specially elected for the purpose, as the case may be.

Interpretation: In Paris, the wealthiest 1 ­percent held roughly 67 ­percent of all private 
property in 1910, compared with 49 ­percent in 1810 and 55 ­percent in 1780. ­After a slight

Fig. 7.6.  ​Subsistence income and maximal in­equality
Interpretation: In a society where the average income is three times the subsistence in-
come, the maximal share of the top income decile (comparable with a subsistence income 
for the bottom 90 ­percent) is equal to 70 ­percent of total income, and the maximal 
share of the top centile (compatible with subsistence income for the bottom 99 ­percent) 
is 67 ­percent. The richer a society is, the higher the level of in­equality it can achieve.

Interpretation: The results indicated ­here are based on decennial censuses from 1951 to 
2011 and National Sample Surveys (NSS) surveys 1983–2014. Quotes for access to uni-
versities and government jobs ­were established for the “scheduled castes” (SC) and 
“scheduled tribes” (ST) (former untouchables and disadvantaged aborigines) in 1950, 
before being extended in the 1980s to “other backward classes” (OBC) (former Shudras) 
by the Mandal Commission (1979–1980). The OBC ­were surveyed in the NSS only 
beginning in 1999, and the estimates shown ­here for 1981 and 1991 (35 ­percent of the 
population) are approximate. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.

to four days of unskilled urban ­labor; in 1750–1850 this ­rose to ten to twenty days of 
wages. Receipts remained around two to five days of wages in the Ottoman and Chi-
nese Empires. With national income per capita of around 250 days of urban wages, this 
meant that receipts stagnated at 1–2 ­percent of national income in the Chinese and Ot-
toman Empires but ­rose from 1–2 to 6–8 ­percent in Eu­rope. Sources and series: piketty.

received roughly 5–10 ­percent of the total. Over the long run, the reduction of in­equality

Interpretation: The market value of private property (real estate, professional and finan-
cial assets, net of debt) was close to six to eight years of national income in Western Eu­
rope from 1870 to 1914 before collapsing in the period 1914–1950 and stabilizing at two 
to three years of national income in 1950–1970, then rising again to five to six years in 
2000–2010. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.

Interpretation: Public debt increased sharply ­after the two world wars to between 150 
and 300 ­percent of national income in 1945–1950. It then fell sharply in Germany and 
France (owing to debt cancellations and high inflation) and more slowly in the United 
Kingdom and United States (moderate inflation, growth). Public assets (notably real es-
tate and financial) varied less strongly over time and generally stood at about 100 ­percent 
of national income. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.

Interpretation: Inflation was virtually zero in the eigh­teenth and nineteenth centuries be-
fore rising in the twentieth ­century. Since 1990 it has been on the order of 2 ­percent per 
year. Inflation was particularly strong in Germany and France from 1914 to 1950 and to 
a lesser degree in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in the 1970s. Note:

Fig. 10.13.  ​Effective rates and progressivity in the United States, 1910–2020
Interpretation: From 1915 to 1980, the tax system in the United States was highly pro-
gressive, in the sense that effective tax rates (all taxes combined, in ­percent of total pretax 
income) ­were significantly higher for the highest incomes than for the population as a 
­whole (especially the poorest 50 ­percent). Since 1980, the system has not been very pro-
gressive, with ­limited differences in effective rates. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/

teenth ­century and ­until World War I before rising sharply from 1910 to 1980, then sta-

Fig. 10.15.  ​The rise of the social state in Eu­rope, 1870–2015
Interpretation: In 2015, fiscal receipts represented 47 ­percent of national income on av-
erage in Western Eu­rope and ­were spent as follows: 10 ­percent of national income for 
regalian expenses (army, policy, justice, general administration, and basic infrastructure, 
such as roads); 6 ­percent for education; 11 ­percent for pensions; 9 ­percent for health care; 
5 ­percent for social transfers (other than pensions); and 6 ­percent for other social expenses 
(housing, ­etc.). Before 1914, regalian expenses absorbed nearly all tax revenues. Note: The 
evolution depicted ­here is the average of Germany, France, United Kingdom, and Sweden 
(see Fig. 10.14). Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.

and 60–80 million in 2020. ­There have been frequent changes in relative position, how-
ever: in 1800 France was 50 ­percent larger than Germany (31 million vs. 22 million); in 
1910, Germany was 50 ­percent larger than France (63 million vs. 41 million). According 
to UN predictions, the United Kingdom and France should be the largest countries by

Interpretation: In the United States, private financing represented 65 ­percent of total (pri-

mary and secondary education. The shares of private financing of higher education vary 
strongly with country, with an Anglo-­American model, a south Eu­ro­pean model, and a 
north Eu­ro­pean model. Private financing is relatively insignificant in primary and sec-

Fig. 12.4.  ​Capital flight from Rus­sia to tax havens
Interpretation: By examining the growing gap between cumulative Rus­sian trade surpluses 
(nearly 10 ­percent a year on average from 1993 to 2015) and official reserves (barely 
30 ­percent of national income in 2015), and using vari­ous hypotheses about yields ob-
tained, one can estimate that the amount of Rus­sian assets held in tax havens was be-
tween 70 and 110 ­percent of national income in 2015, with an average value of around 
90 ­percent. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.

Fig. 12.5.  ​Financial assets held in tax havens
Interpretation: By exploiting anomalies in international financial statistics and break-
downs by country of residence from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and 
the Swiss National Bank (SNB), one can estimate that the share of financial assets held 
in tax havens is 4 ­percent for the United States, 10 ­percent for Eu­rope, and 50 ­percent 
for Rus­sia. ­These figures exclude nonfinancial assets (such as real estate) and financial 
assets unreported to BIS and SNB, and should be considered minimum estimates. Sources

Fig. 12.7.  ​Owner­ship of Chinese firms, 1978–2018
Interpretation: The Chinese state (at all levels of government) in 2017 held roughly 
55 ­percent of the capital of Chinese firms (both listed and unlisted, of all sizes in all sec-
tors), compared with 33 ­percent for Chinese ­house­holds and 12 ­percent for foreign in-
vestors. The share of the latter has decreased since 2006 and that of Chinese ­house­holds 
has increased, while the share of the Chinese state has stabilized at around 55 ­percent.

1999 and 14.5 ­percent in 2010–2018, partly ­because of the uncompensated decrease in 
customs duties and other taxes on international trade (which brought in 5.9 ­percent of 
GDP in the 1970s, 3.9 ­percent in the 1990s, and 2.8 ­percent in 2010–2018). In high-­
income countries (top third: Eu­rope, North Amer­i­ca, ­etc.), customs duties ­were already

lizing. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.

Interpretation: Voter turnout has been relatively stable at around 80–85 ­percent in pres-
idential elections since 1965 (with a slight drop to 75 ­percent in 2017). The decrease was 
much sharper in legislative elections, where turnout was 80 ­percent ­until the 1970s but 
less than 50 ­percent in 2017. Turnout fell in the United Kingdom before climbing again 
in 2010. In the United States it has generally fluctuated at around 50–60  ­percent.

obtained 69 ­percent of the vote of the bottom wealth decile, 23 ­percent of the ­middle 
decile, and 13 ­percent of the top centile. More broadly, the profile of the left-­wing vote

Interpretation: In 1948, the Demo­cratic candidate (H. Truman) won 62 ­percent of the 
vote among voters with a primary education (no high school diploma) (63 ­percent of the 
electorate at the time) and 26 ­percent of the vote among voters with advanced degrees 
(1 ­percent of the electorate at the time). In 2016, the Demo­cratic candidate (H. Clinton) 
won 45 ­percent of the vote among ­those with high school diplomas (59 ­percent of the 
electorate) and 75 ­percent of the vote among ­those with a doctorate (2 ­percent of the 
electorate). As in France, the electoral cleavage totally reversed between 1948 and 2016.

came to be associated with highly educated voters. In the period 2010–2020, it is close 
to being associated with high-­income and wealthy voters as well. Sources and series:

Difference in the vote for Labour between the 10 percent
most highly educated and the remaining 90 percent
fig. 15.12.  ​From the workers’ party to the party of the highly educated: The ­Labour 
vote, 1955–2017
Interpretation: In 1955, the ­Labour Party scored twenty-­five points lower among the 
most highly educated 10 ­percent than among the other 90 ­percent of voters; in 2017, its 
score was thirteen points higher among the most highly educated 10 ­percent. Control-
ling for other variables affects levels but does not alter the trend. Sources and series:

fig. 15.13.  ​The electoral left in Eu­rope and the United States, 1945–2020: From the 
workers’ party to the party of the highly educated
Interpretation: In the period 1950–1970, the vote for the Demo­cratic Party in the 
United States, for the parties of the left (Socialists-­Communists-­Radicals-­Greens) in 
France, and for the ­Labour Party in the United Kingdom was associated with less 
educated voters; in the period 1990–2010, it came to be associated with more highly 
educated voters. The British evolution slightly lags the French and American but goes 
in the same direction. Sources and series: piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.
