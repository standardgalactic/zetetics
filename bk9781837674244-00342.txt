Valence Bond Theory
Valence bond theory (VB theory) is a theory of the chemical bond that
focuses on the linking of pairs of neighbouring atoms by the overlap
of their orbitals and the pairing of spins of the electrons that occupy
them. Thus, the bond between atoms A and B is described by the
(unnormalized) wavefunction
cAB(1; 2) ¼ {cA(1)cB(2) þ cA(2)cB(1)} {a(1)b(2)  a(2)b(1)}
The overall wavefunction of a polyatomic molecule is the product of
such wavefunctions for all the bonds in the molecule as expressed by
one of its canonical structures, a structure exhibiting the topological
layout of bonds, such as one of the Kekulé structures of benzene. The
basic theory is augmented by allowing resonance, which is the im-
provement of the description by the superposition of wavefunctions
corresponding to diﬀerent canonical structures, including ionic struc-
tures. The geometry of molecules is matched by allowing for the pro-
motion of atoms and the hybridization of their atomic orbitals, and the
resulting localized bonds are classified as s and p. See promotion, hy-
brid orbitals, and resonance.
Valence Electron
A valence electron is an electron in the outermost occupied shell of an
atom and is the focus of bond formation. It occupies one of the va-
lence orbitals of an atom, an orbital in that shell.

of a real gas in which attractions and repulsions between the mol-
ecules are expressed by two parameters, a and b, respectively:

van der Waals Forces
van der Waals forces are the forces of attraction between closed-shell
atoms and molecules, and specifically the interactions for which the

potential energy is proportional to 1/R6, where R is the internuclear
separation. (The force itself is proportional to 1/R7.) They are com-
monly classified as dipole–dipole, dipole–induced dipole, and in-
duced dipole–induced dipole (London, dispersion) interactions. A van
der Waals molecule is a loose cluster of closed-shell molecules or
atoms held together by van der Waals forces.
van der Waals Loops
van der Waals loops are the unphysical oscillations of the isotherms
predicted by the van der Waals equation of state below the critical
temperature. They are replaced by straight lines by using the Maxwell
construction.
van ’t HoﬀEquation
There are two unrelated van’t Hoﬀequations. One (which is also known
as the van’t Hoﬀisochore) relates the temperature dependence of the
equilibrium constant to the standard reaction enthalpy:
d ln K
dT
¼ DrH-(T)
RT 2
It follows that the equilibrium constant increases with temperature if
the reaction is endenthalpic (DrH-40) but decreases if it is ex-
enthalpic (DrH-o0). Provided the reaction enthalpy can be regarded
as constant in the temperature range of interest, this equation implies
that
ln K T2

Þ ¼ ln K T1

The kinetic explanation of this dependence notes that the activation
energy of the reverse of an exenthalpic reaction is greater than that of
the forward reaction (Figure V.2). Therefore, the rate of the reverse
reaction increases with temperature more than the rate of the forward
reaction increases. As a result, the equilibrium shifts towards react-
ants and K decreases.
The other van ’t Hoﬀequation relates the osmotic pressure, P, to
the molar concentration, [ J], of a solution:
P ¼ RT J½ 

Vapour Pressure
The vapour pressure, p, is the pressure of the vapour in equilibrium
with a condensed phase of the substance. The partial vapour pressure,
pJ, is the vapour pressure of J when other gases are present. The term
sublimation vapour pressure is sometimes used when the condensed
phase is a solid. The temperature dependence of the vapour pressure
is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation (an approximate version of
the exact Clapeyron equation):
d ln p
dT
E DvapH
RT2
The vapour pressure also varies with the applied pressure, DP:
p(DP) ¼ p(0)eVmDP=RT
The vapour pressure above a curved surface diﬀers from that when
the surface is flat, the dependence on the radius r of a presumed
spherical surface being given by the Kelvin equation:
p(r) ¼ p(N)e2gVm=rRT
( p(N) corresponds to a flat surface.) The vapour pressure of a liquid
in an ideal solution is expressed by Raoult’s law:
p(xsolvent) ¼ xsolvent p
where p* is the vapour pressure of the pure solvent. For a nonideal
solution, the mole fraction xsolvent is replaced by the solvent activity,
asolvent:
p(xsolvent) ¼ asolvent p

The boiling temperature, Tb, is the temperature at which the vapour
pressure of a liquid becomes equal to the ambient pressure. The
standard boiling point is the boiling temperature when the ambient
pressure is 1 bar. The normal boiling point (the ‘boiling point’) is the
boiling temperature when the ambient pressure is 1 atm.
Variation Principle
The variation principle states that if the energy is calculated from a
trial wavefunction by varying its parameters, then that energy is never
less than the true ground-state energy, E0,true:
Ecalculated ¼
ð
ctrial bHctrialdt
ð
ctrialctrialdt
;
EcalculatedZE0;true
The implication is that the best form of a trial wavefunction, the form
that most closely matches the true wavefunction of the system, is the
one with values of the parameters that result in the lowest energy
(Figure V.3). When the trial wavefunction is written as a linear com-
bination with the coeﬃcients the variable parameters, then the op-
timum form, the best values of the coeﬃcients, is obtained by solving
the secular equations.
Vector Model
The vector model of angular momentum is a pictorial depiction of
the state with quantum numbers j, mj in which a vector of length
{ j( j þ 1)}1/2 and z-component mj lies at a stationary but indeterminate
azimuthal angle on a cone around the z-axis (Figure V.4). In the

presence of a magnetic field, the vector precesses on the cone at the
Larmor frequency. The vector model can be elaborated to depict the
coupling of angular momenta, when the contributing vectors are
drawn with definite phases to acquire the correct resultant vectors:
see singlet and triplet states.
Vertical Transition
A vertical transition is an electronic transition that, in accord with the
Franck–Condon principle, occurs without change of the nuclear co-
ordinates and therefore is depicted by a vertical line on a molecular
potential-energy diagram.
Vibrational Motion
Vibrational motion is a repetitive oscillatory motion that, in molecules,
leaves the centre of mass and the orientation of the molecule un-
changed. Vibration is commonly expressed in terms of harmonic
motion, in which a particle of mass m is subjected to a Hooke’s law
force, that the restoring force is proportional to the displacement
(Figure V.5). The classical behaviour, with initial conditions x(0) and
x_(0), is then described as follows, where kf is the force constant:

general a function of stretching and bonding contributions and an
eﬀective mass which depends on the quantity of matter that moves in
the course of the vibration. When the displacements are so great that
the potential can no longer be regarded as parabolic, the motion is
anharmonic. See Morse potential.
Vibrational Temperature
The vibrational temperature, yV, of a harmonic oscillator is its char-
acteristic vibrational frequency, n, expressed as a temperature:
yV ¼ hn
k
Many vibrational states are occupied when TcyV and the vibrational
partition function is then
qE T
yV ¼ kT
hn
Virial Theorem
The virial theorem states that if the potential energy has the form
Ep¼ axb, then the mean potential and kinetic energies are related by
2hEki ¼ bhEpi
For a harmonic oscillator, b ¼ 2, so hEki ¼ hEpi; for a hydrogenic atom,
b ¼ 1, so hEki ¼ 1
2 hEpi, which implies that E ¼ 1
2 hEpi.
Virtual Orbital
A virtual orbital of an atom is an atomic orbital that is not occupied in
the ground state of an atom but which is a member of the basis used
to construct molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic
orbitals.
Virtual Transition

ecule by a perturbation, H(1), it expresses the distortion by mixing into

Viscosity
Viscosity is a measure of a fluid’s resistance to flow. More formally, the
coeﬃcient of viscosity, Z, is the constant of proportionality between the
flux of momentum and the gradient of a perpendicular component of
velocity:
Jx ¼  Z dvz
dx
The physical inspiration for this definition is that if the flow of the
fluid is Newtonian (that is, can be regarded as a series of layers
moving past each other at diﬀerent rates), then the migration of a
molecule from a slowly moving layer to a faster layer slows that layer
and hence retards the flow of the liquid (Figure V.7). The SI units of
Z are kg m1 s1, but it is commonly reported in poise (P), with
1 P ¼ 101 kg m1 s1. See also diﬀusion.
The kinetic theory of gases can be used to derive an approximate
expression for the coeﬃcient of viscosity. For a gas composed of

molecules of molar mass M, mass m, mean free path l, and collision
cross-section s:
Z ¼ 1
3 Mlvmean[ J] ¼ mvmean
3s
It follows that the viscosity of a perfect gas is independent of the
pressure and increases as the temperature is increased. The in-
dependence of pressure arises because the increase of the number of
molecules cancels a decrease in mean free path, so although there are
more transporting molecules, they carry the momentum for a shorter
distance. The increase with temperature (as T1/2) is due to the greater
transport of momentum at higher temperatures.
The viscosity of a liquid decreases with increasing temperature, the
temperature dependence being approximately
Z ¼ Z0eEa=RT
In this case, the migration of molecules is an activated process be-
cause a molecule must escape from the attraction of its neighbours.
The rheological (flow) properties of solutions of macromolecules
are sometimes started in terms of their intrinsic viscosity, [Z], where [Z]
is the coeﬃcient in
Z ¼ Z (1 þ [Z]c þ  )
In this expression Z* is the viscosity of the pure solvent and c is its
mass concentration. Thus
[Z] ¼ lim
c!0
Z=Z  1

One application of the intrinsic viscosity is to the estimation of the
(viscosity-average) molar mass, M̄ v, by using the Mark–Houwink
equation:
[Z] ¼ K Ma
v
where K and a are empirical constants.
