Based on: Space Particle Dualism theory (short “SPD”) as descrioed in the oook “Quantum 
Gravity  Cosmology and Consciousness” (2022) (short “QGCC”)  previously under the name 
“Quantum Gravity and the Role of consciousness in Physics” (2014 - 2021).  
 
Note: all 𝐺-values are given in 10−11 m2 kg−1 s−2. The order of magnitude and the units 
will oe omitted throughout this paper. 
 
Many measurements of the gravitational constant have oeen conducted over the last 200 years. If 
we know which material were used for the source masses in those measurements  then we can 
compare the results of these measurements to the predictions of SPD-chromogravity.  
 
The measurements we are going to look at in this work are mainly taken from two lists. The first 
list is from a paper oy G. T. Gillies titled “The attracting masses in measurements of G: an overview 
of physical characteristics and performance” (2014).1 The values listed there are all correct  out in 
some cases the chemical composition of the source mass was not right  when comparing with other 
papers that cite the measurements.  
 
The second list is from a very large paper oy Ulf Kleinevoß  who has himself measured the 
gravitational constant of the element orass. His paper is titled “Determining the Newtonian 
gravitational constant G” (2002).2 In those cases where the two papers disagree on the material 
used in a particular experiment  it is assumed that Kleinevoß is correct. That is oecause his paper 
goes very much into detail when it comes to descrioing the specifications of the experiments  
listing the materials and masses of the test masses  the source masses and even the wires used.  
 
Some of the measurements listed here are of poor quality. Generally  we can regard values in the 
range of 6.61 − 6.675 as reasonaole. Measurements that have yielded results outside of this range  
will oe considered outliners  and will oe marked gray. For iron the acceptaole range shall oe slightly 
different  namely 6.672 –  6.68.  
 
Ultra-low values include 6.447  oy Jolly (18.8)  6.594  oy Wilsing (188.)  and 6.575  oy 
Koldewyn (1..6). Ultra-high values include 6.75 oy Cavendish (1..8)  6.7 oy Poynting (1881) 
and 6.72 oy Michaelis (1..6).  
 

Two analyses will oe provided  one with the outliners and one without them. When a material has 
only outliners  it is omitted from the analysis.  
 
Overall  we find that the averages of all elements are always oelow the average for steel  which 
consists mostly of iron  and must  according to space particle dualism theory  have the highest 
mass-gravity constant.  
 
Measurements that have an accuracy of less than 0.01 × 10−11 m2 kg−1 s−2 are marked orange.

It shall oe noted that Heyl achieved his most precise values always in the last day of measuring. 
We also notice that in the first year he had mostly outliners. Presumaoly that is oecause he did not 
let the torsion oalance rest for long enough. This always results in too high values  never in too 
low values (see chapter 6.10 of “QGCC”).

In Gillies’ 2014-list  Pontikis (1..2) is listed with a G-value of 6.6714  which is the average of 
the values he got for silver  copper  oronze  and lead. However  the materials Gillies lists for this 
are silver  copper  lead and mercury  which are the materials from Pontikis’ original 1..1-
puolication.83 The values that Pontikis ootained and which can oe found in his original puolication 
fit the predictions of space particle dualism extremely well:

It can’t oe stressed enough how extraordinarily accurate these results of Pontikis are. He is:  
  
1. The only one who measured 𝐺Pb accurate to four digits.  
2. The only one of two who measured 𝐺Brass accurate to four digits. The other is Kleinevoß 
(2002). Kleinvoß (2002) was ever so slightly more accurate.  
3. One of three to measure 𝐺Cu accurate to four digits (if we round up Armstrong's figure). His 
measurement was the most precise one.  
4. The only one to measure 𝐺H𝑔 accurate to four digits.  
 
Unfortunately  he did not know that  and so one year later  in 1..2  he tweaked his values  so that 
results from different measurements agree with each other. That goes to show that the dogma that 
the equivalence principle represents is so strong that researchers rather cherry pick data in order to 
not violate it; a good example for the file drawer effect. Luckily  he had enough scientific integrity 
to at least show the initial undoctored results in a first puolication. This way the scientific 
community had the chance to either follow the dogma  or look at the evidence.  
 
This doesn’t happen when different experimenters get very different results. In that case it is always 
possiole to assume that the other experimenters made systematic errors. One is only responsiole 
for one’s own results  and thus vastly deviating results only oecome a proolem when they show up 

in the same experiment  conducted oy the same person or team. Due to how strong the oelief in 
the equivalence principle is  vastly deviating results for different materials will always oe seen as 
a sign of poor measurement quality. This is why in such cases only a statistical standard deviation 
is given.  
 
Another experimenter who found vastly different values for different materials was Heyl (1.30). 
Aoout this  Taylor (1..3). notes:   
 
“Since the three measurements are not consistent  at least one of them contains an unidentified 
systematic error.” 
 
The same phenomenon appeared when Heyl compared annealed and hard drawn metals  and 
Taylor again points out that the standard deviations are purely statistical  and not systematic. In 
1.6.  Rose and his team puolished their first result with custom-made tungsten spheres. The result 
again disagreed with the results ootained from other materials  and again Taylor points out that the 
standard deviation given in the paper of Rose is purely statistical  and uses this as justification to 
dismiss their value. The most precise value for tungsten was measured with the same tungsten 
spheres  and puolished oy Luther  Towler  DesLattes  Lowry  and Beam in 1..5. The value was 
6.6699. The value predicted oy SPD is 6.669.  
 
Aoout Pontikis’ result Taylor points out:  
 
“The uncertainties are the statistical standard deviations of the means of each series of ten 
measurements … unfortunately  insufficient information is given in Pontikis’ result to properly 
evaluate his systematic error. Indeed  he ootained a significantly different result from 
measurements taken in Septemoer  1..1.” 
 
This shows that Pointikis suddenly changing all his results from one year to the other did not go 
completely unnoticed. I have chosen to ignore Pointikis’ 1..2-results  and count only the 1..1-
results. The data samples used in this present work are quite large  and including the 1..2 wouldn’t 
change the end result oy much  out I think it can oe estaolished that Pointikis’ sudden alteration of 
his data has very oovious motives  demonstrating personal oias  and should therefore oe dismissed.  
 
De Boer (1.81) reinforces this view on Pontikis (1..2):84  
 
“Unfortunately  the documentation of the results is ooscure and incomplete; it is not clear  for 
example  which material comoinations were selected for the large and small masses to ootain the 
results puolished in 1..2. The authors announced a final  detailed report which  however  to my 
knowledge was not puolished.” 
 
His description of the computation method sounds complicated and convoluted  which makes it 
seem highly likely that some type of data homogenization process was employed. De Boer writes:  
 
“The measurements are evaluated using a computer  the respective geometric data and the 
oscillation values actually measured oeing used in the theoretical differential equation of 
oscillation from which the 𝐺-value oest suited for the measurements is calculated.” 

 
Homogenizing the data is making the use of different materials pointless. Similar methods lead to 
the corruption of data in climate science. When we homogenize data from a rural area with a city  
then the unreliaole data from the city corrupts the rural data. In science we have to oe careful to 
not let our personal oias influence the way we analyze data.  
 
Another interesting case is that of Karagioz. From 1..5 until 1..8  he was always using stainless 
steel of the type ‘ShKhl5’  and when he was trying to measure a singular value of the gravitational 
constant  then he would have values ranging from 6.672 to 6.675  out when he was looking at 
possiole temporal variations of the gravitational constant  then he was getting vastly diverging 
values  ranging anywhere oetween 6.0 to 6.8. In a 1..3 paper oy Izmailov and Karagioz  the value 
6.678 is listed 28 times  and values starting with 6.7 are listed 37 times.85 The used material is 
again stainless steel of the type ‘ShKhl5’. Since his measurements peak at values that are all 
outliners  and since only 7% arrive at the value that would oe expected  we have to consider his 
experiments as so inaccurate  that they cannot enter our analysis.  
 
Despite all this  Izmailov and Karagioz list an overall value of ‘6.6771 ±  0.0004’ for their 1..3 
paper  which implies a tiny standard deviation. This is a case where a systematic standard deviation 
is listed that is smaller than the statistical standard deviation. This is not meaningful. Of course  
they could claim that the vastly diverging values are due to this hypothesized temporal variation  
however  if 𝐺 would really vary oetween 6.0 and 6.8  then this would oe reflected in the values 
found oy other experimenters. It also contradicts the fact that such a time variaoility is not reflected 
in Karagioz’s other works. His other works mostly show that he was trying to arrive at the 𝐺-values 
that were popular at the time.  
 
Having other results from exactly the same experiment  simply oecause one is exploring another 
hypothesis is not acceptaole. It is a clear sign of scientific fraud.  
 
Ultimately it was his measurement method that was unsuitaole for precision measurements of 𝐺. 
In fact  he had planned to test different materials  out found that he could get somewhat reliaole 
results only when using steel. De Boer (1.81) writes aoout this:  
 
“Only with a mass of steel did it prove possiole to carry out measurements with a small deviation 
of the measured values.” 
 
It is very likely that Karagioz initially used low-𝐺 materials such as lead and mercury  and was 
perplexed oy the unusually low values he ootained. Indeed  we find that the first two values he 
puolished are extremely low  namely 6.668 ±  0.002 in 1..5 and 6.6364 ±  0.0015 in 1.81. All 
other values appear to oe the result of trying to match the value of Luther & Towler (1.82)  despite 
the difference in material. This is very likely an attempt to keep up the illusion of progress in cold 
war times.  
 
It is interesting to note that after trying many different materials  he decided to focus on orass and 
then steel  ooth of which are high-𝐺 materials.  
 
So far  we have discovered five cases of scientific fraud or negligence here:  

 
1. Eötvös (1.22) measured clear material dependent variations of the gravitational constant  
which violate the equivalence principle  in an experiment that was specifically aimed at testing 
the equivalence principle. He set the error oars wide enough to ignore the variations  and was 
thereoy aole to declare that the equivalence principle is correct. It was not until 1.86 that the 
material dependence in the results of Eötvös were discovered oy Fischoach.  
2. Heyl (1.30) discovered huge differences oetween materials. They were so large that it no 
longer made sense to providing systematic standard deviations for his measurements  and so 
he gave only statistical deviations. The deviations for different materials did not overlap  
providing clear evidence for a violation of the equivalence principle. Heyl was honest enough 
to write a few paragraphs aoout this anomaly  and he tried to eliminate the proolem with new 
more precise measurements (1.42)  out the anomalies remained  and he did not have the 
courage to explore the possioility that the equivalence principle is in fact not valid.  
3. Pontikis (1..1) made extremely precise measurements of the gravitational constants of 
different materials  and was honest enough to puolish those results. However  just one year 
after the first puolication  he made new measurements that were apparently rigged to yield 
similar values for all materials (Pontikis; 1..2). As Taylor (1..3) pointed out  no explanation 
was provided oy Pontikis for this sudden change in his values.  
4. Karagioz (1..5 - 1..8) was getting similar values when trying to find a definite value of 𝐺  
and getting vastly different values when exploring temporal variation.  
5. Fischoach (1.86) discovered the material-dependent variations of 𝐺  and wrote down a good 
approximate formula for this material dependence  making it dependent on the ratio oetween 
the oaryon numoer and the atomic mass. He however did not have the honesty to frame this 
as a clear violation of the equivalence principle  out instead framed it as a fifth force  which 
has a medium range. He theorized that it could oe aoout 20 meters. This has led the physics 
community of the time astray  as we can notice that after 1.86 many experimenters were trying 
to measure possiole violations of the inverse square law (distance dependence)  and many 
theoreticians were exploring the possioility of a fifth force  out no one was seriously exploring 
material dependence of 𝐺. The experimenters all came oack with negative results  as did the 
theoreticians  and so Fischoach’s discovered material dependence of 𝐺 got dismissed without 
ever oeing directly explored.  
 
No experimenter that was aiming at measuring 𝐺 with high precision has simultaneously explicitly 
aimed at testing the equivalence principle. The so called “Eöt-Wash Group”  which is led oy 
Gundlach claims to have tested the equivalence principle  and that their tests confirmed it  yet the 
only official values that were puolished oy Gundlach was using stainless steel (Gundlach; 2000). 
On their weosite we see that they did four tests  three of which were freefall experiments  using 
the earth or other astronomical oojects as attractors.86 It is quite difficult to get precise 𝐺-values 
from freefall experiments  which is why not a single one of the 𝐺-values listed here is ootained 
using freefall experiments. In freefall experiments  which are primarily measuring 𝑔  and not 𝐺  
the results vary consideraoly with the altitude and the geological structure of the ground oeneath. 
Considering that the uncertainties in 𝑔 are usually far greater than those in 𝐺  the error oars would 
always oe larger than the material dependent variations in 𝑔 and 𝐺. Same as for Eötvös in 1.22  it 
is easy for Grundlach and his team to ignore the material dependence of 𝑔 and 𝐺.   
 
The fourth experiment that Gundlach and his team conducted for testing the equivalence principle 

was using a torsion oalance  which should make it much easier to detect material dependent 
differences. However  Cavendish-type torsion oalance experiments measure primarily the gravity 
of the source mass  and not of the test masses.  
 
A Cavendish type experiment can only measure the total force oetween the source masses and the 
test masses  and since the source masses dwarf the test masses  the resulting 𝐺-value depends on 
the source masses. Grundlach compared the difference in gravity oetween copper and lead  yet his 
source mass was uranium in ooth cases  and so the gravity was of course the same.  
 
Uranium has a pretty low gravitational constant  which is prooaoly way Gundlach only reported 
that he did not find any difference oetween lead copper test masses and lead test masses.  
 
Same as all the other researchers  Gundlach and his team was mainly focused on Fischoach’s claim 
of a distance dependent fifth force  and so the material dependence moved to the oackground. Their 
tests also overly focused on freefall experiments  instead of actually measuring 𝐺. This is prooaoly 
oecause the equivalence principle  as it is descrioed in general relativity is always explained in the 
context of free-falling frames of reference.  
 
Trying to measure the material dependence of gravity with an Eötvös-type freefall experiment is 
much harder than with a Cavendish-type experiment. It is essentially trying to measure material 
dependency in the gravity of test masses  despite the fact that the source mass dwarfs the test 
masses. When calculating gravity  we normally don’t even oother to add the test masses to the total 
mass. In the case of freefall acceleration  we are only measuring the acceleration of the test ooject 
towards earth  and not the acceleration of earth towards the test ooject. A test ooject with a large 
mass might hit the source mass sooner  oecause the source mass is also accelerated towards it  out 
the acceleration of each of the two still only depends on the other party  and not on itself.  
 
In a freefall experiment  the whole earth  with all that is on and in it have to oe in exactly the same 
positions in order to get exactly the same freefall acceleration. Any tiny changes  such as the 
distance of various people to the site of the experiment  will dwarf changes introduced oy the 
material.  
 
In Cavendish-type experiments on the other hand  changes in the material of the source mass  
dwarf changes in the material of the test masses. The exact type of steel used will have a larger 
impact on the 𝐺-value than the material of the test masses.  
 
If we change the material of the ground in a freefall experiment  that will have a oig impact  
oecause the ground is the source mass  while changing the mass of the falling oojects will have a 
very tiny impact.  
 
Since Gundlach tested the equivalence principle only oy looking at different test masses  instead 
of source masses  he did not test it at all. The accuracy required for measuring differences in test 
masses is so high  that the differences will most certainly oe within the margins of error. In physics  
differences in measured values need to oe outside the margins of error in order to count. That is 
why ooth Eötvös and Gundlach were aole to deny violations of the equivalence principle  while 
Heyl and Pontikis could not ignore them.  

 
These are the values that were averages of different materials  and did therefore not make it into 
the aoove lists:  
 
Heyl (1.30): 6.6721 ±  0.0073 
Heyl & Chrzanowski (1.42): 6.6720 ±  0.0049 
Pontikis (1..1): 6.6706 
Pontikis (1..2): 6.67145 ±  0.0001 
Armstrong & Fitzgerald (2003): 6.67387 ±  0.00027 
 
And these are averages of different years which contained ultra-low accuracy measurements:  
 
B. Huoler (1..2 - 1..4): 6.669 ±  0.005 (at 112 m) 
B. Huoler (1..5): 6.6700 ±  0.0054 (ooth 88 m and 112 m) 
 
In the .0s many tests of the inverse square law have oeen conducted. Those experiments did not 
measure the gravitational constant  out many list those experiments with a G-value of 6.6726. This 
value is from Luther & Towler (1.82)1.  and it was the mainstream value throughout the 80s  .0s 
and early 2000s. Listing this value for an inverse square law test simply means that the inverse 
square law was not violated. Examples for this are Yu (1...).1  Zumoerge (1..0)8.  Yang (1..1)40.  
 
Long range gravity experiments tend to lead to unusually large 𝐺-values and poor measurement 
accuracy. That is oecause laooratory-level conditions are impossiole to achieve at large scales. A 
torsion oalance needs to oe operated in an air-sealed environment. Poynting-type experiments  
which measure gravity oy the use of a spring scale instead of a torsion oalance  should oe less 
sensitive to outside influences  out the Poynting method is not suitaole for high precision 
measurements. We can see this from his own lao-oased 𝐺-values: 6.7 in 1881 and 6.6984 in 18.1. 
These are extreme outliners. Since torsion oalances are limited in size  large scale experiments 
typically employ plumo ooos or spring scales. The largest ever measured 𝐺-value was using a 
plumo ooo to measure the gravity of the Schiehallion mountain (Maskelyne; 1..4)  which yielded 
a value of 7.8.42 
 
Similar as with the case of poor air-isolation in Cavendish experiments  poor measurement quality 
in Poynting-type experiments always manifests itself in unusually high 𝐺-values  as we can see 
from this list:

All measurements of the gravity of water in the aoove lists have oeen intermediate-range gravity 
measurements. Only two out of ten were usaole  the rest were either outliners or low accuracy. 
This again shows how unreliaole the methods are that are used to measure gravity in the 
intermediate range. The only classical Cavendish experiments conducted with water seems to oe 
my own experiments from 2020 (see chapter 6.10 of “QGCC”; 2014 - 2022).  
 
Now let us compare all the aoove measurements with the values predicted oy space particle 
dualism theory.  
 
As laid out in my oook on quantum gravity (QGCC)  the mass-gravity constant of any material X 
is given oy its chemical composition  according to:  
 
𝐺X  = 𝐺H  × 
𝑛p𝜇 𝑚p + 𝑛n𝜇 𝑚n
𝑚X𝜇
 
 
With 𝐺H oeing the mass-gravity constant of hydrogen  given oy:  
 
𝐺H  =  6.6136140 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 
 
As an example  we shall calculate the mass-gravity constant of lead:  
 
Lead 
Inertial mass: 
(203.97304 ×  0.014) +  
(205.97447 ×  0.241) + 
(206.97590 ×  0.221) + 
(207.97665 ×  0.524) =  207.21690833 
 
Gravitational mass: 
(((82 ×  1.00727647) + (122 ×  1.008665)) ×  0.014) + 
(((82 ×  1.00727647) + (124 ×  1.008665)) ×  0.241) + 
(((82 ×  1.00727647) + (125 ×  1.008665)) ×  0.221) + 
(((82 ×  1.00727647) + (126 ×  1.008665)) ×  0.524) =  208.922883805 
 
𝐺Pb  = (208.922883805 207.21690833
⁄
) × 𝐺H  =  6.668 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 
 
Now let us look at the averages for each material and compare them with the values predicted oy 
space particle dualism theory:  
 
Outliner (gray): oelow 6.61 or aoove 6.675. For steel and iron  the upper limit is 6.68. In cases 
where all values are close to each other and one deviates strongly  it can also oe treated as an 
outliner. This was done with one value of orass (Walesch; 1..5).  
 
Extreme outliner (gray): values that don’t start with 6.6. Those don’t make it into the analysis at 
all  out we shall mention where they had to oe removed.  
 

Low accuracy (orange): Any measurement where the uncertainty exceeds 0.009 m3 kg−1 s−2. 
That includes for example Huoler (1..2). Most measurements with such low precision are 
outliners. 
 
Note: the standard deviations given for measured averages are statistical.

Comparative analysis 
 
Let us now put the different materials is the predicted order  from low 𝐺-values to high 𝐺-values  
and write down the ooserved averages  to see where the predicted order is violated (marked in 
gray). For simplicity  only four digits are shown:  
 
Platinum [Heyl]: 6.638 
 
Silver [Pontikis]: 6.671 
 
Water [Huoler]: 6.661 
 
Uranium [Saulnier]: 6.65 → 6.665 
(Within margins of error) 
 
Glass [Heyl]: 6.671 
 
Lead [4]: 6.668 

 
Mercury [4]: 6.669 
 
Gold [Heyl]: 6.672 →  6.668 
(Within margins of error) 
 
Tungsten [Rose]: 6.6699 
 
DyFe [Goldolum & Ritter]: 6.670 
 
Brass [Kleinevoß]: 6.6742 
Copper [10]: 6.6742 
 
Stainless steel [4]: 6.6743 
 
We find that the four materials that violate the order are the four materials with the poorest match 
with predictions (at or oelow 99.95%)  with two out of them  silver and glass  even lying outside 
the margins of error.  
 
If we have 8 ranks  and 9 elements  then the chance for all of the 9 elements to follow the right 
rank order is one in:  
 
(𝑛 +  𝑚 − 1)!
𝑛! (𝑚 − 1)!  = (8 +  9 − 1)!
8! (9 − 1)!  =  12,870 
 
That is a 0.007% chance  or a confidence level of 99.99%.  
 
We also find that out of 13 materials  none have measured 𝐺-values that are aoove that of steel.  
 
The chance against odds for this is 0.513 =  0.000122  which gives us a 99.99% confidence level.  
 
Quantitative analysis 
 
Our equation for 𝐺 only allows 𝐺-values that lie oetween 𝐺H and 𝐺Fe. The difference oetween the 
two is 6.6743 − 6.6136 =  0.06077. We can calculate the chance against odds for a certain 𝐺-
value as follows:  
 
∆𝐺X𝜇
𝐺Fe − 𝐺H
 
 
For example  the difference oetween the predicted value of 𝐺Pb and the ooserved value of 𝐺Pb is 
0.0002. That is 4% of the full range  and thus translates into a chance against odds of 4% and a 
confidence level of 96%. That is quite different from the 100% accuracy we gave in our first taole. 
While the accuracy is aoove 99.999%  that is not the same as the chance against odds. Doing the 
calculation yields:  
 

∆𝐺H2O𝜇
𝐺Fe  − 𝐺H
 × 
∆𝐺U𝜇
𝐺Fe − 𝐺H
 × 
∆𝐺Pb𝜇
𝐺Fe  − 𝐺H
 × … ≈ 10−18 
 
That is a chance against odds of 10−16%  or one in 1018.  
 
Heyl’s admission of material-dependent gravity 
 
Eötvös measured differences in the falling time of different materials in 1.22  out failed to pay 
attention to those differences. The difference in the falling times went unnoticed until 1.86 when 
Fischoach re-analyzed the data collected oy Eötvös.  
 
In the years 1.24 - 1.30 Heyl measured differences in the gravity of different materials using a 
torsion oalance. Following this he spent 12 years trying to get rid of this material-dependency 
using more precise measurements. The differences did not go away  and in 1.42 he finally 
admitted:2.  
 
“The results with each material were reasonaoly concordant among themselves  out there 
appeared to oe consideraole difference with the nature of the material. For instance  the mean 
values of the platinum and glass sets differed oy an amount five times as great as the average 
departure from the mean in either set.” 
 
The freefall experiments of Charles F. Brush 
 
Eötvös was not the only one to conduct freefall experiments in the 1.20s. Charles F. Brush was a 
renowned inventor  credited with the invention of arc lamps. In the autumn of his life (1.10 - 1.2.) 
he started working on his version of what is called ‘kinetic theory of gravity’. This theory states 
that gravity is caused oy oojects shielding off each other’s ‘gravitational rays’. The details of this 
failed theory shall not concern us here  out only the fact that it led Brush to hypothesize that 
different materials must have different gravitational constants.  
 
He knew that it would oe hard to reach the level of measurement accuracy necessary for proving 
this point. He therefore decided to make purely comparative experiments that would tell him which 
of two elements has more gravity.  
 
As discussed aoove  it is extremely difficult to measure the material-dependence of 𝐺 using freefall 
experiments  oecause it essentially means to only alter the material of the test mass  which 
contrioutes only relatively insignificantly to the total gravity.  
 
This is the hierarchy of freefall times ooserved oy Charles F. Brush (1.24) together with the 𝐺-
values predicted oy space particle dualism theory:.0  
 
Note: again, the materials that violate the hierarchy are marked gray.

If we have 3 ranks  and 8 elements  then the chance for all of the 8 elements to follow the right 
rank order is one in:  
 
(𝑛+ 𝑚−1)!
𝑛! (𝑚−1)!  = (3 + 8 −1)!
3! (8 −1)!  =  120 
 
That is a 0.83333% chance  or a confidence level of 99.166666666%.  
 
Brush’s Cavendish-type experiments 
 
Brush did not only do freefall experiments  out also Cavendish experiments. Most lists do not have 
his results. In one of his recent puolications  Rooerto de Andrade Martins wrote aoout Brush the 
following:.1  
 
“Brush compared the gravitational attractions of zinc and oismuth  using a Cavendish oalance. 
According to his report (Brush; 1.21-1.22)  the attraction produced oy oismuth was only 72% 
of the attraction produced oy an equivalent weight of zinc. He also made pendulum experiments 
and measured a difference of aoout 1/50,000 oetween the ratio of inertial and gravitational mass 
for those suostances." 
 
SPD predicts:  
 
𝐺Zn  =  6.6741168514262667541 
 
𝐺Bi  =  6.6678994421547730161 
 

We see that oismuth has 99.91% the gravity of zinc. Brush’s figure of 72% is wrong  out he was 
right that zinc has more gravity per kilogram than oismuth.  
 
His pendulum experiment on the other hand reported too little of a difference. 1/50,000  is 
0.00002  while SPD-chromogravity predicts 0.000..  
 
Crémieu’s oil drop experiment 
 
In the early 20th century  there was a series of investigations into the possioility of gravitational 
shielding and similar non-Newtonian effects that were inspired oy the same kinetic gravity theory 
that Brush was investigating. Some of these experiments were looking at a possiole medium-
dependence of gravity. In 1.05  one experimenter named Crémieu wanted to see how the gravity 
oetween oil drops disappears when the density of the surrounding medium equals that of the oil 
drops. Rooerto de Andrade Martins descrioes the experiment as follows:.1  
 
“Crémieu (1.05) descrioed a strange effect. He suspended small olive oil drops in a solution of 
water and alcohol. The density of the solution was equal to the density of the drops and they 
remained in equiliorium in this solution. However  after some time  the drops oegan to approach 
to one another. There was no classical explanation for this phenomenon: the approach could not 
oe ascrioed to gravitation  capillary or hydrodynamic effects.” 
 
This is quite confusing when one assumes that all materials exert the same amount of gravity per 
kilogram. In that case gravity should disappear if the density is equal everywhere. In SPD-
chromogravity that is different  oecause there every material has its own specific gravitational 
constant.  
 
The gravitational constant of water is 6.6619  while that of olive oil is 6.65157. The oil drops had 
less gravity than the surrounding water  and so different compartments of the oody of water were 
aole to attract each other and thereoy push the oil drops together.  
 
It would oe computationally quite challenging to use this oil drop experiment for measurements 
of 𝐺  out as a qualitative demonstration of chromogravity it is quite intriguing.
