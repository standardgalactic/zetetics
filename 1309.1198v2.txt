THE PRO- ´ETALE TOPOLOGY FOR SCHEMES
BHARGAV BHATT AND PETER SCHOLZE
To G´erard Laumon, with respect and admiration
ABSTRACT. We give a new deﬁnition of the derived category of constructible Qℓ-sheaves on a scheme, which
is as simple as the geometric intuition behind them. Moreover, we deﬁne a reﬁned fundamental group of
schemes, which is large enough to see all lisse Qℓ-sheaves, even on non-normal schemes. To accomplish these
tasks, we deﬁne and study the pro-´etale topology, which is a Grothendieck topology on schemes that is closely
related to the ´etale topology, and yet better suited for inﬁnite constructions typically encountered in ℓ-adic
cohomology. An essential foundational result is that this site is locally contractible in a well-deﬁned sense.

1. INTRODUCTION
Let X be a variety over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k. The ´etale cohomology groups Hi(X´et, Qℓ), where
ℓis a prime different from the characteristic of k, are of fundamental importance in algebraic geometry.
Unfortunately, the standard deﬁnition of these groups is somewhat indirect. Indeed, contrary to what the
notation suggests, these groups are not obtained as the cohomology of a sheaf Qℓon the ´etale site X´et. The
´etale site gives the correct answer only with torsion coefﬁcients, so the correct deﬁnition is
Hi(X´et, Qℓ) := (lim
←−
n
Hi(X´et, Z/ℓnZ)) ⊗ZℓQℓ.
In this simple situation, this technical point is often unproblematic1. However, even here, it takes effort to
construct a natural commutative differential graded Qℓ-algebra giving rise to these cohomology groups. This
so-called Qℓ-homotopy type was constructed by Deligne in [Del80], using certain subtle integral aspects of
homotopy theory due independently to Miller [Mil78] and Grothendieck.
For more sophisticated applications, however, it is important to work in a relative setup (i.e., study con-
structible sheaves), and keep track of the objects in the derived category, instead of merely the cohomology
groups. In other words, one wants a well-behaved derived category Db
c(X, Qℓ) of constructible Qℓ-sheaves.
Deligne, [Del80], and in greater generality Ekedahl, [Eke90], showed that it is possible to deﬁne such a
category along the lines of the deﬁnition of Hi(X´et, Qℓ). Essentially, one replaces Hi(X´et, Z/ℓnZ) with
the derived category Db
c(X, Z/ℓnZ) of constructible Z/ℓnZ-sheaves, and then performs all operations on
the level of categories:2
Db
c(X, Qℓ) := (lim
←−
n
Db
c(X, Z/ℓnZ)) ⊗ZℓQℓ.
Needless to say, this presentation is oversimpliﬁed, and veils substantial technical difﬁculties.
Nonetheless, in daily life, one pretends (without getting into much trouble) that Db
c(X, Qℓ) is simply
the full subcategory of some hypothetical derived category D(X, Qℓ) of all Qℓ-sheaves spanned by those
bounded complexes whose cohomology sheaves are locally constant along a stratiﬁcation. Our goal in this
paper to justify this intuition, by showing that the following deﬁnitions recover the classical notions. To
state them, we need the pro-´etale site Xpro´et, which is introduced below. For any topological space T, one
has a ‘constant’ sheaf on Xpro´et associated with T; in particular, there is a sheaf of (abstract) rings Qℓon
Xpro´et associated with the topological ring Qℓ.
Deﬁnition 1.1. Let X be a scheme whose underlying topological space is noetherian.
(1) A sheaf L of Qℓ-modules on Xpro´et is lisse if it is locally free of ﬁnite rank.
(2) A sheaf C of Qℓ-modules on Xpro´et is constructible if there is a ﬁnite stratiﬁcation {Xi →X} into
locally closed subsets Xi ⊂X such that C|Xi is lisse.
(3) An object K ∈D(Xpro´et, Qℓ) is constructible if it is bounded, and all cohomology sheaves are
constructible. Let Db
c(X, Qℓ) ⊂D(Xpro´et, Qℓ) be the corresponding full triangulated subcategory.
The formalism of the six functors is easily described in this setup. In particular, in the setup above, with
the naive interpretation of the right-hand side, one has
Hi(X´et, Qℓ) = Hi(Xpro´et, Qℓ) ;
for general X, one recovers Jannsen’s continuous ´etale cohomology, [Jan88].
Similarly, the complex
RΓ(Xpro´et, Qℓ) is obtained by literally applying the derived functor RΓ(Xpro´et, −) to a sheaf of Q-algebras,
and hence naturally has the structure of a commutative differential graded algebra by general nonsense (see
[Ols11, §2] for example); this gives a direct construction of the Qℓ-homotopy type in complete generality.
A version of the pro-´etale site was deﬁned in [Sch13] in the context of adic spaces. The deﬁnition given
there was somewhat artiﬁcial, mostly because non-noetherian adic spaces are not in general well-behaved.
This is not a concern in the world of schemes, so one can give a very simple and natural deﬁnition of Xpro´et.
Until further notice, X is allowed to be an arbitrary scheme.
1It becomes a problem as soon as one relaxes the assumptions on k, though. For example, even for k = Q, this deﬁnition is not
correct: there is no Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence linking these naively deﬁned cohomology groups of X with those of Xk.
One must account for the higher derived functors of inverse limits to get a theory linked to the geometry of Xk, see [Jan88].
2In fact, Ekedahl only deﬁnes the derived category of constructible Zℓ-sheaves, not performing the ﬁnal ⊗ZℓQℓ-step.

Deﬁnition 1.2.
(1) A map f : Y →X of schemes is weakly ´etale if f is ﬂat and ∆f : Y →Y ×X Y is ﬂat.
(2) The pro-´etale site Xpro´et is the site of weakly ´etale X-schemes, with covers given by fpqc covers.
Any map between weakly ´etale X-schemes is itself weakly ´etale, and the resulting topos has good cate-
gorical properties, like coherence (if X is qcqs) and (hence) existence of enough points. For this deﬁnition
to be useful, however, we need to control the class of weakly ´etale morphisms. In this regard, we prove the
following theorem.
Theorem 1.3. Let f : A →B be a map of rings.
(1) f is ´etale if and only if f is weakly ´etale and ﬁnitely presented.
(2) If f is ind-´etale, i.e. B is a ﬁltered colimit of ´etale A-algebras, then f is weakly ´etale.
(3) If f is weakly ´etale, then there exists a faithfully ﬂat ind-´etale g : B →C such that g ◦f is ind-´etale.
In other words, for a ring A, the sites deﬁned by weakly ´etale A-algebras and by ind-´etale A-algebras are
equivalent, which justiﬁes the name pro-´etale site for the site Xpro´et deﬁned above. We prefer using weakly
´etale morphisms to deﬁne Xpro´et as the property of being weakly ´etale is clearly ´etale local on the source
and target, while that of being ind-´etale is not even Zariski local on the target.
One might worry that the pro-´etale site is huge in an uncontrolled way (e.g., covers might be too large,
introducing set-theoretic problems). However, this does not happen. To see this, we need a deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 1.4. An afﬁne scheme U is w-contractible if any faithfully ﬂat weakly ´etale map V →U admits
a section.
A w-contractible object U ∈Xpro´et is somewhat analogous to a point in the topos theoretic sense: the
functor Γ(U, −) is exact and commutes with all limits, rather than colimits. In fact, a geometric point of
X deﬁnes a w-contractible object in Xpro´et via the strict henselisation. However, there are many more
w-contractible objects, which is the key to the control alluded to above:
Theorem 1.5. Any scheme X admits a cover in Xpro´et by w-contractible afﬁne schemes.
Despite the analogy between w-contractible objects and points, Theorem 1.5 has stronger consequences
than the mere existence of points. For example, the inverse limit functor on systems
. . . →Fn →Fn−1 →. . . →F1 →F0
of sheaves on Xpro´et is well-behaved, the derived category of abelian sheaves on Xpro´et is left-complete and
compactly generated, unbounded cohomological descent holds in the derived category, and Postnikov towers
converge in the hypercomplete ∞-topos associated with Xpro´et. This shows that the pro-´etale site is useful
even when working with torsion coefﬁcients, as the derived category of X´et is left-complete (and unbounded
cohomological descent holds) only under ﬁniteness assumptions on the cohomological dimension of X, cf.
[LO08].
We note that one can ‘cut off’ Xpro´et by only allowing weakly ´etale X-schemes Y of cardinality < κ
for some uncountable strong limit cardinal κ > |X|, and all results above, especially the existence of w-
contractible covers, remain true. In particular, the resulting truncated site Xpro´et forms a set, rather than a
proper class, so we can avoid universes in this paper.
Let us explain the local structure of a scheme in the pro-´etale site.
Deﬁnition 1.6.
(1) A ring A is w-local if the subset (SpecA)c ⊂SpecA of closed points is closed, and any connected
component of SpecA has a unique closed point.
(2) A map f : A →B of w-local rings is w-local if Specf : SpecB →SpecA maps closed points to
closed points.
The next result shows that every scheme is covered by w-local afﬁnes in the pro-Zariski topology, and
hence in the pro-´etale topology. In particular, as noetherian schemes have ﬁnitely many connected compo-
nents, this shows that non-noetherian schemes are unavoidable when studying Xpro´et, even for X noetherian.

Theorem 1.7. The inclusion of the category of w-local rings with w-local maps in the category of all
rings admits a left adjoint A 7→AZ. The unit A →AZ of the adjunction is faithfully ﬂat and an ind-
(Zariski localisation), so SpecAZ →SpecA is a cover in Spec(A)pro´et. Moreover, the subset (SpecAZ)c ⊂
SpecAZ of closed points maps homeomorphically to SpecA, equipped with its constructible topology.
In other words, SpecAZ is roughly the disjoint union of the local rings of A. However, the union is not
exactly disjoint; rather, the set of connected components π0(SpecAZ) is naturally a proﬁnite set, which is
SpecA with its constructible topology. Thus, the study of w-local rings splits into the study of its local rings
at closed points, and the study of proﬁnite sets. It turns out in practice that these two aspects interact little.
In particular, this leads to the following characterization of w-contractible schemes.
Theorem 1.8. An afﬁne scheme X = SpecA is w-contractible if and only if A is w-local, all local rings at
closed points are strictly henselian, and π0(X) is extremally disconnected.
Recall that a proﬁnite set S is extremally disconnected if the closure of any open subset U ⊂S is still
open. By a theorem of Gleason, S is extremally disconnected if and only if S is projective in the category
of compact Hausdorff spaces, i.e., any surjective map T →S from a compact Hausdorff space T admits a
section. In particular, the Stone-Cech compactiﬁcation of any discrete set is extremally disconnected, which
proves the existence of enough such spaces. Using this construction, if A is w-local, it is relatively easy to
construct a faithfully ﬂat ind-´etale A-algebra B satisfying the conditions of the theorem, which proves the
existence of enough w-contractible schemes.
As a ﬁnal topic, we study the fundamental group. In SGA1, a proﬁnite group π´et
1 (X, x) is deﬁned for
any connected scheme X with a geometric point x. It has the property that the category of lisse Zℓ-sheaves
on X is equivalent to the category of continuous representations of π´et
1 (X, x) on ﬁnite free Zℓ-modules.
However, the analogue for lisse Qℓ-sheaves fails (unless X is geometrically unibranch) as Qℓ-local systems
admit Zℓ-lattices only ´etale locally. For example, if X is P1 with 0 and ∞identiﬁed (over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld), then X admits a cover f : Y →X where Y is an inﬁnite chain of P1’s. One can descend
the trivial Qℓ-local system on Y to X by identifying the ﬁbres at 0 and ∞using any unit in Qℓ, e.g.
ℓ∈Q×
ℓ. However, representations of π´et
1 (X, x) = ˆZ with values in GL1(Qℓ) will have image in GL1(Zℓ)
by compactness. This suggests that the ’true’ π1 of X should be Z ⊂ˆZ = π´et
1 (X, x). In fact, in SGA3 X6,
a prodiscrete group πSGA3
1
(X, x) is deﬁned, which gives the desired answer in this example. Its deﬁning
property is that Hom(πSGA3
1
(X, x), Γ) is in bijection with Γ-torsors trivialized at x, for any discrete group
Γ. However, in general, πSGA3
1
(X, x) is still too small to detect all Qℓ-local systems through its ﬁnite
dimensional continuous Qℓ-representations: the failure is visible already for X a high-genus curve with two
points identiﬁed (this example is due to Deligne, and recalled in Example 7.4.9).
We circumvent the issues raised above by working with a larger category of “coverings” than the ones
used in constructing π´et
1 (X, x) and πSGA3
1
(X, x). To recover groups from such categories, we study some
general inﬁnite Galois theory. The formalism leads to the following kind of groups.
Deﬁnition 1.9. A topological group G is called a Noohi group if G is complete, and admits a basis of open
neighborhoods of 1 given by open subgroups.
The word “complete” above refers to the two-sided uniform structure on G determined by its open sub-
groups. For example, locally proﬁnite groups, such as GLn(Qℓ), are Noohi groups. Somewhat more sur-
prisingly, GLn(Qℓ) is also a Noohi group. The main result is:
Theorem 1.10. Let X be a connected scheme whose underlying topological space is locally noetherian.
The following categories are equivalent.
(1) The category LocX of sheaves on Xpro´et which are locally constant.
(2) The category CovX of ´etale X-schemes Y which satisfy the valuative criterion of properness.
For any geometric point x of X, the inﬁnite Galois theory formalism applies to LocX equipped with the
ﬁbre functor at x, giving rise to a Noohi group πpro´et
1
(X, x). The pro-ﬁnite completion of πpro´et
1
(X, x) is
π´et
1 (X, x), and the pro-discrete completion of πpro´et
1
(X, x) is πSGA3
1
(X, x). Moreover, Qℓ-local systems on
X are equivalent to continuous representations of πpro´et
1
(X, x) on ﬁnite-dimensional Qℓ-vector spaces, and
similarly for Qℓreplaced by Qℓ.
4

Informally, the difference between πpro´et
1
(X, x) and the classical fundamental groups stems from the
existence of pro-´etale locally constant sheaves that are not ´etale locally constant. This difference manifests
itself mathematically in the lack of enough Galois objects, i.e., πpro´et
1
(X, x) does not have enough open
normal subgroups (and thus is not prodiscrete). It is important to note that the construction of πpro´et
1
(X, x)
is not completely formal. Indeed, as with πSGA3
1
(X, x), it is not clear a priori that πpro´et
1
(X, x) contains
even a single non-identity element: a coﬁltered limit of discrete groups along surjective transition maps can
be the trivial group. Thus, one must directly construct elements to show πpro´et
1
(X, x) is big enough. This
is done by choosing actual paths on X, thus reuniting the classical point of view from topology with the
abstract approach of SGA1.
Finally, let us give a short summary of the different sections. In Section 2, we study w-local rings and
the like. In Section 3, we study a general topos-theoretic notion (namely, repleteness) which implies left-
completeness of the derived category etc. . We also include some discussions on complete sheaves, which
are again well-behaved under the assumption of repleteness. In Section 4, we introduce the pro-´etale site,
and study its basic properties. The relation with the ´etale site is studied in detail in Section 5. In Section 6, we
introduce constructible sheaves (recalling ﬁrst the theory for torsion coefﬁcients on the ´etale site), showing
that for schemes whose underlying topological space is noetherian, one gets the very simple deﬁnition stated
above. Finally, in Section 7, we deﬁne the pro-´etale fundamental group.
Acknowledgments. The vague idea that such a formalism should exist was in the air since the paper
[Sch13], and the second-named author received constant encouragement from Michael Rapoport, Luc Illusie
and many others to work this out. Martin Olsson’s question on the direct construction of the Qℓ-homotopy
type led to the birth of this collaboration, which soon led to much ﬁner results than initially expected.
Ofer Gabber suggested that weakly ´etale morphisms could be related to ind-´etale morphisms. Johan de
Jong lectured on some parts of this paper in Stockholm, and provided numerous useful and enlightening
comments. Conversations with Brian Conrad also clariﬁed some arguments.
H´el`ene Esnault urged us to think about fundamental groups of non-normal schemes from the perspective
of the pro-´etale topology, which led to §7. Moreover, Pierre Deligne generously shared his notes on fun-
damental groups, which had an important inﬂuence on the material in §7, especially in relation to Noohi
groups and abstract inﬁnite Galois theory. Deligne’s results were slightly weaker: in the language intro-
duced in §7.2, he ﬁrst proves that any countably generated (in a suitable sense) inﬁnite Galois category is
automatically tame, and then specializes this result to schemes to obtain, using purely abstract arguments,
a pro-(Noohi group) from a certain category of “coverings” that turns out to be equivalent to CovX; here
the pro-structure is dual to the ind-structure describing this category of coverings as a ﬁltered colimit of
countably generated inﬁnite Galois categories. After we realized that this pro-group is realized by its limit
by using geometric paths, Gabber explained to us his different perspective on fundamental groups, which
we explain in Remark 7.4.12 below.

2. LOCAL STRUCTURE
The goal of this section is to study some algebra relevant to the pro-´etale topology. Speciﬁcally, we show:
(a) weakly ´etale and pro-´etale maps deﬁne the same Grothendieck topology on rings in §2.3, and (b) this
Grothendieck topology has enough “weakly contractible” objects in §2.4.
2.1. Spectral spaces. Let S be the category of spectral spaces with spectral maps, and let Sf ⊂S be the full
subcategory of ﬁnite spectral spaces (= ﬁnite T0 spaces), so S = Pro(Sf), cf. [Hoc69]. Our main goal is to
show that each X ∈S admits a pro-(open cover) XZ →X such that XZ admits no further non-split open
covers. This goal is eventually realized in Lemma 2.1.10. Before constructing XZ, however, we introduce
and study the subcategory of S where spaces of the form XZ live:
Deﬁnition 2.1.1. A spectral space X is w-local if it satisﬁes:
(1) All open covers split, i.e., for every open cover {Ui ֒→X}, the map ⊔iUi →X has a section.
(2) The subspace Xc ⊂X of closed points is closed.
A map f : X →Y of w-local spaces is w-local if f is spectral and f(Xc) ⊂Y c. Let i : Swl ֒→S be the
subcategory of w-local spaces with w-local maps.
The ﬁrst condition in Deﬁnition 2.1.1 is obviously necessary for the promised application. The second
condition turns out to be particularly convenient for applications.
Example 2.1.2. Any proﬁnite set is a w-local space. Any local scheme has a w-local topological space. The
collection of w-local spaces is closed under ﬁnite disjoint unions.
The property of w-locality passes to closed subspaces:
Lemma 2.1.3. If X ∈Swl, and Z ⊂X is closed, then Z ∈Swl.
Proof. Open covers of Z split as any open cover of Z extends to one of X (by extending opens and adding
X −Z). Moreover, it is clear that Zc = Xc ∩Z, so the claim follows.
□
Recall that the inclusion Pro(Setf) ⊂Pro(Sf) = S has a left-adjoint X 7→π0(X), i.e., the counit X →
π0(X) is the universal spectral map from X to a proﬁnite set. Given a coﬁltered presentation X = limi Xi
with Xi ∈Sf, we have π0(X) = limi π0(Xi). We use this to give an intrinsic description of w-local spaces:
Lemma 2.1.4. A spectral space X is w-local if and only if Xc ⊂X is closed, and every connected compo-
nent of X has a unique closed point. For such X, the composition Xc →X →π0(X) is a homeomorphism.
Proof. The second part follows immediately from the ﬁrst as Xc is proﬁnite when X is w-local. For the
ﬁrst, assume that X is w-local; it sufﬁces to show that each connected component has a unique closed point.
Then Lemma 2.1.3 shows that any connected component is also w-local, so we may assume X is connected.
If X has two distinct closed points x1, x2 ∈Xc, then the open cover (X −{x1}) ⊔(X −{x2}) →X has
no section, which contradicts w-locality.
Conversely, assume Xc ⊂X is closed, and that each connected component has a unique closed point.
Then Xc is proﬁnite, and hence Xc →π0(X) is a homeomorphism. Now ﬁx a ﬁnite open cover {Ui ֒→X}
with Ui quasicompact. We must show that π : Y := ⊔iUi →X has a section. As Xc is proﬁnite, there
is a map s : Xc →Y lifting the inclusion Xc ֒→X. Let Z ⊂π0(Y ) be the image of the composite
Xc
s→Y →π0(Y ). Then Z is a closed subset of π0(Y ), and the canonical maps Xc →Z →π0(X) are all
homeomorphisms. In particular Z ֒→π0(Y ) is a pro-(open immersion). Let Y ′ := Y ×π0(Y ) Z ֒→Y be the
inverse image. Then Y ′ is a spectral space with π0(Y ′) = Z. The map Y ′ →Y is pro-(open immersion),
so the map φ : Y ′ →X is pro-open. One checks from the construction φ induces a homeomorphism
π0(Y ′) →π0(X). Moreover, the ﬁbres of Y ′ →π0(Y ′) identify with the ﬁbres of Y →π0(Y ). As the
image of π0(Y ′) →π0(Y ) only contains connected components of Y that contain a point lifting a closed
point of X, it follows that the ﬁbres of Y ′ →π0(Y ′) map homeomorphically onto the ﬁbres of X →π0(X).
Thus φ is a continuous pro-open bijection of spectral spaces. Any such map is a homeomorphism by a
compactness argument. Indeed, if U ⊂Y ′ is a quasicompact open, then φ(U) is pro-(quasi-compact open),
so φ(U) = ∩iVi, where the intersection is indexed by all quasi-compact opens containing φ(U). Pulling
back to Y ′ shows U = ∩iφ−1(Vi). As Y ′ −U is compact in the constructible topology and each φ−1(Vi) is
constructible, it follows that U = φ−1(Vi) for some i, and hence φ(U) = Vi.
□

Remark 2.1.5. Lemma 2.1.4 shows that each w-local space X comes equipped with a canonical “special-
ization” map s : X →Xc, deﬁned as the composition X →π0(X) ≃Xc. Concretely, any x ∈X admits
a unique closed specialization s(x) ∈Xc ⊂X; in fact, the connected component spanned by x has s(x) as
its unique closed point. Any map in Swl preserves specializations and closed points, and is thus compatible
with the specialization maps.
Deﬁnition 2.1.6. Given a closed subspace Z ⊂X of a spectral space X, we say X is local along Z if
Xc ⊂Z, or equivalently, if every x ∈X specializes to a point of Z. The (pro-open) subspace of X
comprising all points that specialize to a point of Z is called the localization of X along Z.
Lemma 2.1.7. A spectral space X that is local along a w-local closed subspace Z ⊂X with π0(Z) ∼=
π0(X) is also w-local.
Proof. It sufﬁces to show that Xc ⊂X is closed, and that the composition Xc →X →π0(X) is a
homeomorphism. Since Xc = Zc, the ﬁrst claim is clear. The second follows from the w-locality of Z: one
has Xc = Zc as before, and π0(X) = π0(Z) by assumption.
□
We recall the structure of limits in S:
Lemma 2.1.8. S admits all small limits, and the forgetful functor S →Set preserves these limits.
Proof. Since S = Pro(Sf), it sufﬁces to show that Sf admits ﬁbre products. Given maps X →Z ←
Y in Sf, one simply checks that a ﬁbre product X ×Z Y in Sf is computed by the usual ﬁbre product
X ×Z Y in Setf with the topology induced from the product topology on X × Y under the inclusion
X ×Z Y ⊂X × Y . The second claim is then clear. Alternatively, observe that there is a factorization
S
a→Pro(Setf)
b→Set, where a(X) is X with the constructible topology, and b(Y ) = Y . Both functors
a and b admit left adjoints α and β respectively: β is the Stone-Cech compactiﬁcation functor, while α is
the natural inclusion Pro(Setf) ⊂Pro(Sf) = S. In particular, the forgetful functor S →Set preserves
limits.
□
The category of w-local spaces also admits small limits:
Lemma 2.1.9. Swl admits all small limits, and the inclusion i : Swl →S preserves these limits.
Proof. We ﬁrst check Swl admits ﬁbre products. Given maps X →Z ←Y in Swl, the ﬁbre product
X ×Z Y in S is local along the (proﬁnite) closed subset Xc ×Zc Y c ⊂X ×Z Y : a point (x, y) ∈X ×Z Y
specializes to the point (s(x), s(y)) ∈Xc ×Zc Y c, where s is the specialization map from Remark 2.1.5.
Then X ×Z Y ∈Swl by Lemma 2.1.7. Moreover, this also shows (X ×Z Y )c = Xc ×Zc Y c, and that
the projection maps X ←X ×Z Y →Y preserve closed points, which proves that X ×Z Y is a ﬁbre
product on Swl. For coﬁltered limits, ﬁx a coﬁltered diagram {Xi} in Swl. Let X := limi Xi be the limit
(computed in S). We claim that X ∈Swl, and the maps X →Xi are w-local. As any open cover of
X can be reﬁned by one pulled back from some Xi, one checks that all open covers of X split. For the
rest, it sufﬁces to show Xc = limi Xc
i ; note that {Xc
i } is a well-deﬁned diagram as all transition maps
Xi →Xj are w-local. It is clear that limi Xc
i ⊂Xc. Conversely, choose x ∈Xc ⊂X with image xi ∈Xi.
Let Yi = {xi} ⊂Xi. Then {Yi} forms a coﬁltered diagram in Swl with limi Yi ⊂X by Lemma 2.1.3.
Moreover, one has limi Yi = {x} = {x} ⊂X by the compatibility of closures and coﬁltered limits. Now
consider the coﬁltered diagram {Y c
i }. As each Y c
i ⊂Yi is a subset, we get limi Y c
i ⊂limi Yi = {x}. Then
either x ∈limi Y c
i or limi Y c
i = ∅; the latter possibility does not occur as a coﬁltered limit of non-empty
compact Hausdorff spaces is non-empty, so x ∈limi Y c
i ⊂limi Xc
i .
□
The adjoint functor theorem and Lemma 2.1.9 show that i : Swl →S admits a left adjoint; this adjoint
is characterized as the unique functor that preserves coﬁltered limits and ﬁnite disjoint unions, and carries a
connected ﬁnite T0 space X to X ⊔{∗}, where ∗is declared to be a specialization of all points of X. This
adjoint is not used in the sequel since it does not lift to the world of schemes. However, it turns out that
i : Swl ֒→S also has a right adjoint which can be described via open covers, passes to the world of schemes,
and will be quite useful:
7

Lemma 2.1.10. The inclusion i : Swl →S admits a right adjoint X 7→XZ. The counit XZ →X is
a pro-(open cover) for all X, and the composite (XZ)c →X is a homeomorphism for the constructible
topology on X.
Proof. We ﬁrst construct the functor X 7→XZ and the counit map XZ →X. As the notions of w-local
spaces and w-local maps are well-behaved under coﬁltered limits by Lemma 2.1.9, it sufﬁces to construct,
for each X ∈Sf, a functorial open cover XZ →X with XZ w-local such that: (a) the functor X 7→XZ
carries maps to w-local maps, (b) (XZ)c →X is a bijection, and (c) (XZ)c ⊂XZ is discrete.
Let X be a ﬁnite T0 space. We deﬁne
XZ =
G
x∈X
Xx ,
where Xx ⊂X is the subset of generalizations of x, which is an open subset of X. Then XZ ∈Sf.
Moreover, each Xx is w-local as the only open of Xx containing x is Xx itself. Stability of w-locality under
ﬁnite disjoint unions shows that XZ is w-local. If f : X →Y is a map of ﬁnite T0 spaces, one gets an
induced map
f Z : XZ =
G
x∈X
Xx →Y Z =
G
y∈Y
Yy ,
by mapping Xx into Yf(x). In particular, this sends the closed point x ∈Xx to the closed point f(x) ∈Yf(x),
so that this map is w-local. Moreover, there is a natural map XZ →X for any X, by embedding each Xx
into X. Clearly, this is an open cover of X. The deﬁnition also shows (XZ)c = X with the discrete
topology (which is the also the constructible topology for ﬁnite T0 spaces).
To show this deﬁnes an adjoint, we must check: given X ∈S, Y ∈Swl, and a spectral map h : Y →X,
there exists a unique w-local map h′ : Y →XZ factoring h. We may assume X ∈Sf as before. As
Y c →Y is closed, the composite g : Y c ֒→Y →X is a spectral map from a proﬁnite set to a ﬁnite
T0 space. One then checks that g−1(x) is clopen in Y c for all x ∈X (the preimage of any open of X is
a quasicompact open, and thus clopen, in the Hausdorff space Y c; one deduces the claim by induction on
#X by excising one closed point at a time). Picking an x ∈X with g−1(x) ̸= ∅and replacing Y with the
clopen subset s−1(g−1(x)) where s : Y →π0(Y ) ≃Y c is the specialization map from Remark 2.1.5, we
may assume that h(Y c) = {x} ⊂X; here we use Lemma 2.1.3 to ensure Y remains w-local. As each point
of Y specialises to a point of Y c, the map h factors through Xx ⊂X, which gives the desired w-local lift
h′ : Y →Xx ⊂XZ; the w-locality requirement forces uniqueness of h′.
□
Remark 2.1.11. The space XZ can be alternatively described as:
XZ =
lim
{Xi֒→X} ⊔if
Xi,
where the limit is indexed by the coﬁltered category of constructible stratiﬁcations {Xi ֒→X}, and f
Xi
denotes the set of all points of X specializing to a point of Xi. One then has a corresponding description of
closed subspaces
(XZ)c =
lim
{Xi֒→X} ⊔iXi ⊂XZ,
so it is clear that (XZ)c →X is a homeomorphism for the constructible topology on the target. This
description and the coﬁnality of afﬁne stratiﬁcations inside all constructible stratiﬁcations show that if X
is an afﬁne scheme, then the maps (XZ)c
a֒→XZ
b→X lift to maps of afﬁne schemes, with a a closed
immersion, and b a pro-(open cover).
Deﬁnition 2.1.12. A map f : W →V of spectral spaces is a Zariski localization if W = ⊔iUi with Ui →V
a quasicompact open immersion. A pro-(Zariski localization) is a coﬁltered limit of such maps.
Both these notions are stable under base change. A key example is:
Lemma 2.1.13. Any map f : S →T of proﬁnite sets is a pro-(Zariski localization). In fact, we can write
S = limi Si as a coﬁltered limit of maps Si →T, each of which is the base change to T of a map from a
proﬁnite set to a ﬁnite set.
8

Proof. Choose a proﬁnite presentation T = limi Ti, and set Si = S ×Ti T. Then Si →T is the base change
of S →Ti, and S ≃limi Si, which proves the claim.
□
We use this notion to split a w-local map into a pro-(Zariski localization), and one that is entirely “local:”
Lemma 2.1.14. Any map f : X →Y in Swl admits a canonical factorization X →Z →Y in Swl with
Z →Y a pro-(Zariski localization) and X →Z inducing a homeomorphism Xc ≃Zc.
Proof. We have a diagram
Xc
/
fc

X
/
f

π0(X) =: S
π0(f)

Y c
/ Y
/ π0(Y ) =: T.
Set Z = Y ×T S. Then by Lemma 2.1.9, Z is w-local and Zc = Y c ×T S ≃Xc. Moreover, the map
S →T is a pro-(Zariski localization), and hence so is Z →Y . The induced map X →Z sends Xc to
Y c ×T S = Zc, and is thus w-local; as Xc →Zc is a homeomorphism, this proves the claim.
□
2.2. Rings. We now adapt the notions of §2.1 to the world of rings via the Zariski topology, and also discuss
variants for the ´etale topology:
Deﬁnition 2.2.1. Fix a ring A.
(1) A is w-local if Spec(A) is w-local.
(2) A is w-strictly local if A is w-local, and every faithfully ﬂat ´etale map A →B has a section.
(3) A map f : A →B of w-local rings is w-local if Spec(f) is w-local.
(4) A map f : A →B is called a Zariski localization if B = Qn
i=1 A[ 1
fi ] for some f1, . . . , fn ∈A. An
ind-(Zariski localization) is a ﬁltered colimit of Zariski localizations.
(5) A map f : A →B is called ind-´etale if it is a ﬁltered colimit of ´etale A-algebras.
Example 2.2.2. For any ring A, there is an ind-(Zariski localization) A →AZ such that Spec(AZ) =
Spec(A)Z, see Lemma 2.2.4. In particular, AZ is w-local. Any strictly henselian local ring A is w-strictly
local. Moreover, any coﬁltered limit of w-strictly local rings along w-local maps is w-strictly local.
Our goal in this section is to explain why every ring admits an ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat w-strictly local
algebra. The construction of this extension, very roughly, mirrors the classical construction of the strict
henselisations at a geometric point: ﬁrst one Zariski localizes at the point, and then one passes up along
all ´etale neighbourhoods of the point. The ﬁrst step is accomplished using the functor A 7→AZ; the next
lemma describes the structure of the resulting ring.
Lemma 2.2.3. If A is w-local, then the Jacobson radical IA cuts out Spec(A)c ⊂Spec(A) with its reduced
structure. The quotient A/IA is an absolutely ﬂat ring.
Recall that a ring B is called absolutely ﬂat if B is reduced with Krull dimension 0 (or, equivalently, that
B is reduced with Spec(B) Hausdorff).
Proof. Let J ⊂A be the (radical) ideal cutting out Spec(A)c ⊂Spec(A) with the reduced structure. Then
J ⊂m for each m ∈Spec(A)c, so J ⊂IA. Hence, Spec(A/IA) ⊂Spec(A)c is a closed subspace; we
want the two spaces to coincide. If they are not equal, then there exists a maximal ideal m such that IA ̸⊂m,
which is impossible.
□
The study of w-local spectral spaces has a direct bearing on w-local rings:
Lemma 2.2.4. The inclusion of the category w-local rings and maps inside all rings admits a left adjoint
A 7→AZ. The unit A →AZ is a faithfully ﬂat ind-(Zariski localization), and Spec(A)Z = Spec(AZ) over
Spec(A).
Proof. This follows from Remark 2.1.11. In more details, let X = SpecA, and deﬁne a ringed space
XZ →X by equipping (SpecA)Z with the pullback of the structure sheaf from X. Then Remark 2.1.11
presents XZ as an inverse limit of afﬁne schemes, so that XZ = Spec(AZ) is itself afﬁne.
□
9

Example 2.2.5. For a ring A, the map A →AZ/IAZ is the universal map from A to an absolutely ﬂat
ring. Indeed, this follows by the universal property of AZ, the w-locality of absolutely ﬂat rings, and the
observation that any w-local map AZ →B with B absolutely ﬂat factors through a map AZ/IAZ →B.
Lemma 2.2.6. Any w-local map f : A →B of w-local rings admits a canonical factorization A a→C
b→B
with C w-local, a a w-local ind-(Zariski localization), and b a w-local map inducing π0(Spec(B)) ≃
π0(Spec(C)).
Proof. This follows from Lemma 2.1.14 and the observation that any map S →π0(Spec(A)) of proﬁnite
sets is induced by an ind-(Zariski localization) A →C by applying π0(Spec(−)) thanks to Lemma 2.1.13.
□
Due to the w-locality of AZ and Lemma 2.2.3, absolutely ﬂat rings play an important role in this section.
The next lemma explains the construction of w-strictly local ind-´etale covers of absolutely ﬂat rings.
Lemma 2.2.7. For any absolutely ﬂat ring A, there is an ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat map A →A with A w-
strictly local and absolutely ﬂat. For a map A →B of absolutely ﬂat rings, we can choose such maps
A →A and B →B together with a map A →B of A-algebras.
Proof. The following fact is used without further comment below: any ind-´etale algebra over an absolutely
ﬂat ring is also absolutely ﬂat. Choose a set I of isomorphism classes of faithfully ﬂat ´etale A-algebras, and
set A = ⊗IAi, where the tensor product takes place over Ai ∈I, i.e., A = colimJ⊂I ⊗j∈JAj, where the
(ﬁltered) colimit is indexed by the poset of ﬁnite subsets of I. Then one checks that A is absolutely ﬂat, and
that any faithfully ﬂat ´etale A-algebra has a section, so A is w-strictly local as Spec(A) is proﬁnite. For the
second part, simply set B to be a w-strictly local faithfully ﬂat ind-´etale algebra over A ⊗A B.
□
To decouple topological problems from algebraic ones, we consistently use:
Lemma 2.2.8. For any ring A and a map T →π0(Spec(A)) of proﬁnite sets, there is an ind-(Zariski
localization) A →B such that Spec(B) →Spec(A) gives rise to the given map T →π0(Spec(A)) on
applying π0. Moreover, the association T 7→Spec(B) is a limit-preserving functor.
One may make the following more precise statement: for any afﬁne scheme X, the functor Y 7→π0(Y )
from afﬁne X-schemes to proﬁnite π0(X)-sets has a fully faithful right adjoint S 7→S ×π0(X) X, the
ﬁbre product in the category of topological spaces ringed using the pullback of the structure sheaf on X.
Moreover, the natural map S ×π0(X) X →X is a pro-(Zariski localisation) and pro-ﬁnite.
Proof. Given T as in the lemma, one may write T = lim Ti as a coﬁltered limit of proﬁnite π0(Spec(A))-
sets Ti with Ti →π0(Spec(A)) being the base change of a map of ﬁnite sets, see Lemma 2.1.13. For each
Ti, there is an obvious ring Bi that satisﬁes the required properties. We then set B := colim Bi, and observe
that π0(Spec(B)) = lim π0(Spec(Bi)) = lim Ti = T as a π0(Spec(A))-set.
□
One can characterize w-strictly local rings in terms of their topology and local algebra:
Lemma 2.2.9. A w-local ring A is w-strictly local if and only if all local rings of A at closed points are
strictly henselian.
Proof. For the forward direction, ﬁx a w-strictly local ring A and choose a closed point x ∈Spec(A)c.
Any faithfully ﬂat ´etale map Ax →B′ is the localization at x of a faithfully ﬂat ´etale map A[ 1
f ] →B
for some f invertible at x. As x is a closed point, we may ﬁnd f1, . . . , fn ∈A vanishing at x such that
C = B × Qn
i=1 A[f −1
i
] is a faithfully ﬂat ´etale A-algebra. This implies that there is a section C →A, and
hence C ⊗A Ax →Ax. As fi vanishes at x, one has C ⊗A Ax = Bx × A′, where A′ has no point above x.
The (algebra) section Bx×A′ →Ax then necessarily factors through the projection on the ﬁrst factor, which
gives us the desired section. For the converse direction, assume A is a w-strictly local ring whose local rings
at closed points are strictly henselian. Fix a faithfully ﬂat ´etale A-algebra B. Then A →B has a section
over each closed point of Spec(A) by the assumption on the local rings. Spreading out, which is possible
by ﬁnite presentation constraints, there is a Zariski cover of Spec(A) over which Spec(B) →Spec(A) has
a section; by w-locality of Spec(A), one ﬁnds the desired section B →A.
□
10

To pass from w-strictly local covers of absolutely ﬂat rings to arbitrary rings, we use henselizations:
Deﬁnition 2.2.10. Given a map of rings A →B, let HensA(−) : Ind(B´et) →Ind(A´et) be the functor
right adjoint to the base change functor Ind(A´et) →Ind(B´et). Explicitly, for B0 ∈Ind(B´et), we have
HensA(B0) = colim A′, where the colimit is indexed by diagrams A →A′ →B0 of A-algebras with
A →A′ ´etale.
Remark 2.2.11. The notation of Deﬁnition 2.2.10 is not ambiguous, i.e., for any map A →B and C ∈
Ind(B´et), the ring HensA(C) depends only on the A-algebra C, and not on B. It follows that if A →A′ →
C is a factorization with A →A′ ind-´etale, then HensA(C) ≃HensA′(C).
Henselization is particularly well-behaved for quotient maps:
Lemma 2.2.12. For surjective maps A →A/I, the functor HensA(−) is fully faithful, so HensA(−) ⊗A
A/I ≃id as functors on Ind((A/I)´et).
Proof. Fix some B0 ∈Ind((A/I)´et) and set B = HensA(B0). By adjointness, it sufﬁces to check B/IB ≃
B0. As any ´etale A/I-algebra C0 lifts to some ´etale A-algebra C, one immediately checks that B →B0 is
surjective. Choose f ∈ker(B →B0). Then f lifts to some ´etale A-algebra C along some map C →B.
If f ∈IC, we are done. If not, f gives an element of the kernel of C/IC →B0. Hence, there is some
diagram C/IC →D0 →B0 in Ind((A/I)´et) with C/IC →D0 ´etale such that f maps to 0 in D0. Choose
an ´etale C-algebra D lifting D0, so f ∈ID. The map D →D/ID = D0 →B0 of A-algebras then gives
a factorization C →D →B, which shows that f ∈IB.
□
The ´etale analogue of Lemmas 2.1.3 and 2.1.7 is:
Lemma 2.2.13. Let A be a ring henselian along an ideal I. Then A is w-strictly local if and only if A/I is
so.
Proof. First assume A/I is w-strictly local. As A is henselian along I, the space Spec(A) is local along
Spec(A/I), so A is w-local by Lemma 2.1.7. Pick a faithfully ﬂat ´etale A-algebra B. Then A/I →B/IB
has a section. By the adjunction HomA(B, HensA(A/I)) ≃HomA(B/IB, A/I) and the identiﬁcation
HensA(A/I) = A, one ﬁnds the desired section B →A. Conversely, assume A is w-strictly local. Then
Spec(A/I)c = Spec(A)c by the henselian property, so Spec(A/I)c ⊂Spec(A/I) is closed. Moreover, any
faithfully ﬂat ´etale A/I-algebra B0 is the reduction modulo of I of a faithfully ﬂat ´etale A-algebra B, so the
w-strict locality of A immediately implies that for A/I.
□
Henselizing along w-strictly local covers of absolutely ﬂat rings gives w-strictly local covers in general:
Corollary 2.2.14. Any ring A admits an ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat map A →A′ with A′ w-strictly local.
Proof. Set A′ := HensAZ(AZ/IAZ), where AZ/IAZ is a w-strictly local ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat AZ/IAZ-
algebra; then A′ satisﬁes the required property by Lemma 2.2.13.
□
We end by noting that the property of w-strictly locality passes to quotients:
Lemma 2.2.15. Let A be a ring with an ideal I. If A is w-strictly local, so is A/I.
Proof. The space Spec(A/I) is w-local by Lemma 2.1.3. The local rings of A/I at maximal ideals are
quotients of those of A, and hence strictly henselian. The claim follows from Lemma 2.2.9.
□
2.3. Weakly ´etale versus pro-´etale. In this section, we study the following notion:
Deﬁnition 2.3.1. A morphism A →B of commutative rings is called weakly ´etale if both A →B and the
multiplication morphism B ⊗A B →B are ﬂat.
Remark 2.3.2. Weakly ´etale morphisms have been studied previously in the literature under the name of
absolutely ﬂat morphisms, see [Oli72]. Here, we follow the terminology introduced in [GR03, Deﬁnition
3.1.1].
Our goal in this section is to show that weakly ´etale maps and ind-´etale maps generate the same Grothendieck
topology, see Theorem 2.3.4 below. We begin by recording basic properties of weakly ´etale maps.
11

Proposition 2.3.3. Fix maps f : A →B, g : B →C, and h : A →D of rings.
(1) If f is ind-´etale, then f is weakly ´etale.
(2) If f is weakly ´etale, then the cotangent complex LB/A vanishes. In particular, f is formally ´etale.
(3) If f is weakly ´etale and ﬁnitely presented, then f is ´etale.
(4) If f and g are weakly ´etale (resp. ind-´etale), then g ◦f is weakly ´etale (resp. ind-´etale). If g ◦f and
f are weakly ´etale (resp. ind-´etale), then g is weakly ´etale (resp. ind-´etale).
(5) If h is faithfully ﬂat, then f is weakly ´etale if and only if f ⊗A D : D →B ⊗A D is weakly ´etale.
Proof. These are well-known, so we mostly give references.
(1) As ﬂatness and tensor products are preserved under ﬁltered colimits, one reduces to the case of ´etale
morphisms. Clearly, f is ﬂat in that case; moreover, B ⊗A B →B is an open immersion on spectra,
and in particular ﬂat.
(2) See [GR03, Theorem 2.5.36] and [GR03, Proposition 3.2.16].
(3) Since f is weakly ´etale and ﬁnitely presented, it is formally ´etale and ﬁnitely presented by (2), hence
´etale.
(4) The ﬁrst part is clear. For the second part in the weakly ´etale case, see [GR03, Lemma 3.1.2 (iv)].
For the ind-´etale case, observe that the category of ind-´etale algebras is equivalent to the ind-category
of ´etale algebras by ﬁnite presentation constraints.
(5) This is clear, as ﬂatness can be checked after a faithfully ﬂat base change.
□
The analogue of (5) fails for ind-´etale morphisms. Our main result in this section is:
Theorem 2.3.4. Let f : A →B be weakly ´etale. Then there exists a faithfully ﬂat ind-´etale morphism
g : B →C such that g ◦f : A →C is ind-´etale.
The local version of Theorem 2.3.4 follows from the following result of Olivier, [Oli72]:
Theorem 2.3.5 (Olivier). Let A be a strictly henselian local ring, and let B be a weakly ´etale local A-
algebra. Then f : A →B is an isomorphism.
Remark 2.3.6. One might hope to use Theorem 2.3.5 for a direct proof of Theorem 2.3.4: Assume that
f : A →B is weakly ´etale. Let C = Q
x Af∗x, where x runs over a set of representatives for the geometric
points of Spec(B), and Af∗x denotes the strict henselization of A at f ∗x. Then Theorem 2.3.5 gives maps
B →Bx ≃Af∗x for each x, which combine to give a map B →C inducing a section of C →B ⊗A C.
However, although each Ax is ind-´etale over A, C is not even weakly ´etale over A, as inﬁnite products do
not preserve ﬂatness. In order to make the argument work, one would have to replace the inﬁnite product
by a ﬁnite product; however, such a C will not be faithfully ﬂat. If one could make the sections B →Ax
factor over a ﬁnitely presented A-subalgebra of Ax, one could also make the argument work. However, in
the absence of any ﬁniteness conditions, this is not possible.
Our proof of Theorem 2.3.4 circumvents the problem raised in Remark 2.3.6 using the construction of
w-strictly local extensions given in §2.2 to eventually reduce to Olivier’s result. We begin by recording the
following relative version of the construction of such extensions:
Lemma 2.3.7. Let f : A →B be a map of rings. Then there exists a diagram
A
/
f

A′
f′

B
/ B′
with A →A′ and B →B′ faithfully ﬂat and ind-´etale, A′ and B′ w-strictly local, and A′ →B′ w-local.
Proof. Choose compatible w-strictly local covers to get a diagram
AZ/IAZ
/

AZ/IAZ =: A0

BZ/IBZ
/ BZ/IBZ =: B0
12

of absolutely ﬂat rings with horizontal maps being faithfully ﬂat and ind-´etale, and A0 and B0 being w-
strictly local. Henselizing then gives a diagram
A
/
f

AZ
fZ

/ HensAZ(A0) =: A′
f′

B
/ BZ
/ HensBZ(B0) =: B′
Then all horizontal maps are ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat. Moreover, both A′ and B′ are w-strictly local by
Lemma 2.2.13. The map f ′ is w-local since Spec(A′)c = Spec(A0), and Spec(B′)c = Spec(B0), so the
claim follows.
□
We now explain how to prove an analogue of Olivier’s theorem for w-strictly local rings:
Lemma 2.3.8. Let f : A →B be a w-local weakly ´etale map of w-local rings with A w-strictly local. Then
f is a ind-(Zariski localization).
Proof. First consider the canonical factorization A →A′ →B provided by Lemma 2.2.6. As A →A′
is w-local with A′ w-local, Lemma 2.2.9 shows that A′ is w-strictly local. Replacing A with A′, we may
assume f induces a homeomorphism Spec(B)c ≃Spec(A)c. Then for each maximal ideal m ⊂A, the ring
B/mB has a unique maximal ideal and is absolutely ﬂat (as it is weakly ´etale over the ﬁeld A/m). Then
B/mB must be a ﬁeld, so mB is a maximal ideal. The map Am →BmB is an isomorphism by Theorem
2.3.5 as Am is strictly henselian, so A ≃B.
□
The promised proof is:
Proof of Theorem 2.3.4. Lemma 2.3.7 gives a diagram
A
/
f

A′
f′

B
/ B′
with f ′ a w-local map of w-strictly local rings, and both horizontal maps being ind-´etale and faithfully ﬂat.
The map f ′ is also weakly ´etale since all other maps in the square are so. Lemma 2.3.8 shows that f ′ is a
ind-(Zariski localization). Setting C = B′ then proves the claim.
□
2.4. Local contractibility. In this section, we study the following notion:
Deﬁnition 2.4.1. A ring A is w-contractible if every faithfully ﬂat ind-´etale map A →B has a section.
The name “w-contractible” is inspired by the connection with the pro-´etale topology: if A is w-contractible,
then Spec(A) admits no non-split pro-´etale covers, and is hence a “weakly contractible” object of the cor-
responding topos. Our goal is to prove that every ring admits a w-contractible ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat cover.
We begin by observing that w-contractible rings are already w-local:
Lemma 2.4.2. A w-contractible ring A is w-local (and thus w-strictly local).
Proof. The map π : Spec(AZ) →Spec(A) has a section s by the assumption on A. The section s is a
closed immersion since π is separated, and Spec(AZ) = Spec(A)Z is w-local, so we are done by Lemma
2.1.3.
□
The notion of w-contractibility is local along a henselian ideal:
Lemma 2.4.3. Let A be a ring henselian along an ideal I. Then A is w-contractible if and only if A/I is
so.
Proof. This is proven exactly like Lemma 2.2.13 using that Ind(A´et) →Ind((A/I)´et) is essentially surjec-
tive, and preserves and reﬂects faithfully ﬂat maps.
□
The main difference between w-contractible and w-strictly local rings lies in the topology. To give mean-
ing to this phrase, recall the following deﬁnition:
13

Deﬁnition 2.4.4. A compact Hausdorff space is extremally disconnected if the closure of every open is open.
One has the following result characterizing such spaces, see [Gle58]:
Theorem 2.4.5 (Gleason). Extremally disconnected spaces are exactly the projective objects in the category
of all compact Hausdorff spaces, i.e., those X for which every continuous surjection Y →X splits.
It is fairly easy to prove the existence of “enough” extremally disconnected spaces:
Example 2.4.6. For any set X, given the discrete topology, the Stone-Cech compactiﬁcation β(X) is ex-
tremally disconnected: the universal property shows that β(X) is a projective object in the category of com-
pact Hausdorff spaces. If X itself comes from a compact Hausdorff space, then the counit map β(X) →X
is a continuous surjection, which shows that all compact Hausdorff spaces can be covered by extremally
disconnected spaces. In fact, the same argument shows that any extremally disconnected space is a retract
of β(X) for some set X.
Extremally disconnected spaces tend to be quite large, as the next example shows:
Example 2.4.7. An elementary argument due to Gleason shows that any convergent sequence in an ex-
tremally disconnected space is eventually constant. It follows that standard proﬁnite sets, such as Zp (or the
Cantor set) are not extremally disconnected.
The relevance of extremally disconnected spaces for us is:
Lemma 2.4.8. A w-strictly local ring A is w-contractible if and only if π0(Spec(A)) is extremally discon-
nected.
Proof. As Spec(A)c →Spec(A) gives a section of Spec(A) →π0(Spec(A)), if A is w-contractible, then
every continuous surjection T →π0(Spec(A)) of proﬁnite sets has a section, so π0(Spec(A)) is extremally
disconnected. Conversely, assume A is w-strictly local and π0(Spec(A)) is extremally disconnected. By
Lemma 2.4.3, we may assume A = A/IA. Thus, we must show: if A is an absolutely ﬂat ring whose local
rings are separably closed ﬁelds, and Spec(A) is extremally disconnected, then A is w-contractible. Pick
an ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat A-algebra B. Then A →B induces an isomorphism on local rings. Lemma
2.2.6 gives a factorization A →C →B with A →C a ind-(Zariski localization) induced by a map of
proﬁnite sets T →Spec(A), and B →C a w-local map inducing an isomorphism on spectra. Then C ≃B
as the local rings of C and B coincide with those of A. As Spec(A) is extremally disconnected, the map
T →Spec(A) of proﬁnite sets has a section s. The closed subscheme Spec(C′) ⊂Spec(C) realizing
s(Spec(A)) ⊂T maps isomorphically to Spec(A), which gives the desired section.
□
We now show the promised covers exist:
Lemma 2.4.9. For any ring A, there is an ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat A-algebra A′ with A′ w-contractible.
Proof. Choose an ind-´etale faithfully ﬂat AZ/IAZ-algebra A0 with A0 w-strictly local and Spec(A0) an
extremally disconnected proﬁnite set; this is possible by Example 2.4.6, Lemma 2.2.7, and Lemma 2.2.8.
Let A′ = HensAZ(A0). Then A′ is w-contractible by Lemma 2.4.3 and Lemma 2.4.8, and the map A →A′
is faithfully ﬂat and ind-´etale since both A →AZ and AZ →A′ are so individually.
□
Lemma 2.4.10. Let A be a w-contractible ring, and let f : A →B be a ﬁnite ring map of ﬁnite presentation.
Then B is w-contractible.
Proof. We can write A = colimi Ai as a ﬁltered colimit of ﬁnite type Z-algebras such that A →B is the
base change of a ﬁnite ring map A0 →B0 of some index 0, assumed to be initial; set Bi = B0 ⊗A0 Ai,
so B = colimi Bi. Then Spec(A) = limi Spec(Ai) and Spec(B) = limi Spec(Bi) as afﬁne schemes and
as spectral spaces, so π0(Spec(B)) = π0(Spec(B0)) ×π0(Spec(A0)) π0(Spec(A)). As π0(Spec(A0)) and
π0(Spec(B0)) are both ﬁnite sets, it follows that π0(Spec(B)) is extremally disconnected as π0(Spec(A))
is such. Moreover, the local rings of B are strictly henselian as they are ﬁnite over those of A. It remains
to check Spec(B) is w-local. By ﬁniteness, the subspace Spec(B)c ⊂Spec(B) is exactly the inverse
image of Spec(A)c ⊂Spec(A), and hence closed. Now pick a connected component Z ⊂Spec(B). The
image of Z in Spec(A) lies in some connected component W ⊂Spec(A). The structure of A shows that
14

W = Spec(Ax) for some closed point x ∈Spec(A)c, so W is a strictly henselian local scheme. Then
Z →W is a ﬁnite map of schemes with Z connected, so Z is also a strictly henselian local scheme, and
hence must have a unique closed point, which proves w-locality of Spec(B).
□
Remark 2.4.11. The ﬁnite presentation assumption is necessary. Indeed, there are extremally disconnected
spaces X with a closed subset Z ⊂X such that Z is not extremally disconnected. As an example, let X
be the Stone-Cech compactiﬁcation of N, and let Z = X \ N. As any element of N is an open and closed
point of X, Z ⊂X is closed. Consider the following open subset ˜U of X:
˜U =
[
n≥1
{x ∈X | x ̸≡0
mod 2n} .
Here, we use that the map N →Z/nZ extends to a unique continuous map X →Z/nZ. Let U = ˜U ∩Z,
which is an open subset of Z. We claim that the closure U of U in Z is not open. If not, then Z admits a
disconnection with one of the terms being U. It is not hard to see that any disconnection of Z extends to a
disconnection of X, and all of these are given by M ⊔(X \ M) for some subset M ⊂N. It follows that
U = M ∩Z for some subset M ⊂N. Thus, U ⊂M, which implies that for all n ≥0, almost all integers
not divisible by 2n are in M. In particular, there is a subset A ⊂M such that A = {a0, a1, . . .} with 2i|ai.
Take any point x ∈A \ N ⊂Z. Thus, x ∈M ∩Z = U. On the other hand, x lies in the open subset
V = A ∩Z ⊂Z, and V ∩U = ∅: Indeed, for any n ≥0,
A ∩{x ∈X | x ̸≡0
mod 2n} ⊂{a0, . . . , an−1} ⊂N .
This contradicts x ∈U, ﬁnally showing that U is not open.

3. ON REPLETE TOPOI
A topos is the category of sheaves on a site, up to equivalence, as in [SGA72a]. We will study in §3.1 a
general property of topoi that implies good behaviour for the lim and R lim functors, as well as unbounded
cohomological descent, as discussed in §3.3. A special subclass of such topoi with even better completeness
properties is isolated in §3.2; this class is large enough for all applications later in the paper. In §3.4 and
§3.5, with a view towards studying complexes of ℓ-adic sheaves on the pro-´etale site, we study derived
completions of rings and modules in a replete topos; the repleteness ensures no interference from higher
derived limits while performing completions, so the resulting theory is as good as in the punctual case.
3.1. Deﬁnition and ﬁrst consequences. The key deﬁnition is:
Deﬁnition 3.1.1. A topos X is replete if surjections in X are closed under sequential limits, i.e., if F :
Nop →X is a diagram with Fn+1 →Fn surjective for all n, then lim F →Fn is surjective for each n.
Before giving examples, we mention two recogition mechanisms for replete topoi:
Lemma 3.1.2. If X is a replete topos and X ∈X, then X/X is replete.
Proof. This follows from the fact that the forgetful functor X/X →X commutes with connected limits and
preserves surjections.
□
Lemma 3.1.3. A topos X is replete if and only if there exists a surjection X →1 and X/X is replete.
Proof. This follows from two facts: (a) limits commute with limits, and (b) a map F →G in X is a
surjection if and only if it is so after base changing to X.
□
Example 3.1.4. The topos of sets is replete, and hence so is the topos of presheaves on a small category.
As a special case, the classifying topos of a ﬁnite group G (which is simply the category of presheaves on
B(G)) is replete.
Example 3.1.5. Let k be a ﬁeld with a ﬁxed separable closure k. Then X = Shv(Spec(k)´et) is replete if
and only if k is a ﬁnite extension of k.3 One direction is clear: if k/k is ﬁnite, then Spec(k) covers the
ﬁnal object of X and X/Spec(k) ≃Set, so X is replete by Lemma 3.1.3. Conversely, assume that X is replete
with k/k inﬁnite. Then there is a tower k = k0 ֒→k1 ֒→k2 ֒→. . . of strictly increasing ﬁnite separable
extensions of k. The associated diagram · · · →Spec(k2) →Spec(k1) →Spec(k0) of surjections has an
empty limit in X, contradicting repleteness.
Remark 3.1.6. Replacing Nop with an arbitrary small coﬁltered category in the deﬁnition of replete topoi
leads to an empty theory: there are coﬁltered diagrams of sets with surjective transition maps and empty
limits. For example, consider the poset I of ﬁnite subsets of an uncountable set T ordered by inclusion, and
F : Iop →Set deﬁned by
F(S) = {f ∈Hom(S, Z) | f injective}.
Then F is a coﬁltered diagram of sets with surjective transition maps, and lim F = ∅.
Example 3.1.5 shows more generally that the Zariski (or ´etale, Nisnevich, smooth, fppf) topoi of most
schemes fail repleteness due to “ﬁnite presentation” constraints. Nevertheless, there is an interesting geo-
metric source of examples:
Example 3.1.7. The topos X of fpqc sheaves on the category of schemes4 is replete. Given a diagram
· · · →Fn+1 →Fn →· · · →F1 →F0 of fpqc sheaves with Fn →Fn−1 surjective, we want lim Fn →F0
to be surjective. For any afﬁne Spec(A) and a section s0 ∈F0(Spec(A)), there is a faithfully ﬂat map
A →B1 such that s0 lifts to an s1 ∈F1(Spec(B1)). Inductively, for each n ≥0, there exist faithfully
ﬂat maps A →Bn compatible in n and sections sn ∈Fn(Spec(Bn)) such that sn lifts sn−1. Then
B = colimn Bn is a faithfully ﬂat A-algebra with s0 ∈F0(Spec(A)) lifting to an s ∈lim Fn(Spec(B)),
which proves repleteness as Spec(B) →Spec(A) is an fpqc cover.
3Recall that this happens only if k is algebraically closed or real closed; in the latter case, k(√−1) is an algebraic closure of k.
4To avoid set-theoretic problems, one may work with countably generated afﬁne schemes over a ﬁxed afﬁne base scheme.
16

The next lemma records a closure property enjoyed by surjections in a replete topos.
Lemma 3.1.8. Let X be a replete topos, and let F →G be a map in Fun(Nop, X). Assume that the induced
maps Fi →Gi and Fi+1 →Fi ×Gi Gi+1 are surjective for each i. Then lim F →lim G is surjective.
Proof. Fix an X ∈X and a map s : X →lim G determined by a compatible sequence {sn : X →Gn}
of maps. By induction, one can show that there exists a tower of surjections · · · →Xn →Xn−1 →· · · →
X1 →X0 →X and maps tn : Xn →Fn compatible in n such that tn lifts sn. In fact, one may take
X0 = X ×G0 F0, and
Xn+1 = Xn ×Fn×GnGn+1 Fn+1.
The map X′ := limi Xi →X is surjective by repleteness of X. Moreover, the compatibility of the tn’s
gives a map t : X′ →lim F lifting s, which proves the claim.
□
We now see some of the beneﬁts of working in a replete topos. First, products behave well:
Proposition 3.1.9. Countable products are exact in a replete topos.
Proof. Given surjective maps fn : Fn →Gn in X for each n ∈N, we want f : Q
n Fn →Q
n Gn to be
surjective. This follows from Lemma 3.1.8 as f = lim Q
i<n fi; the condition from the lemma is trivial to
check in this case.
□
In a similar vein, inverse limits behave like in sets:
Proposition 3.1.10. If X is a replete topos and F : Nop →Ab(X) is a diagram with Fn+1 →Fn surjective
for all n, then lim Fn ≃R lim Fn.
Proof. By Proposition 3.1.9, the product Q
n Fn ∈X computes the derived product in D(X). This gives an
exact triangle
R lim Fn →
Y
n
Fn
t−id
→
Y
n
Fn,
where t : Fn+1 →Fn is the transition map. It thus sufﬁces to show that s := t −id is surjective. Set
Gn = Q
i≤n Fn, Hn = Gn+1, and let sn : Hn →Gn be the map induced by t −id. The surjectivity of
t shows that sn is surjective. Moreover, the surjectivity of t also shows that Hn+1 →Gn+1 ×Gn Hn is
surjective, where the ﬁbre product is computed using sn : Hn →Gn and the projection Gn+1 →Gn. In
fact, the ﬁbre product is Hn × Fn+1 and Hn+1 →Hn × Fn+1 is (pr, t −id). By Lemma 3.1.8, it follows
that s = lim sn is also surjective.
□
Proposition 3.1.11. If X is a replete topos, then the functor of Nop-indexed limits has cohomological di-
mension 1.
Proof. For a diagram F : Nop →Ab(X), we want R lim Fn ∈D[0,1](X). By deﬁnition, there is an exact
triangle
R lim Fn →
Y
n
Fn →
Y
n
Fn
with the last map being the difference of the identity and transition maps, and the products being derived.
By Proposition 3.1.9, we can work with naive products instead, whence the claim is clear by long exact
sequences.
□
Question 3.1.12. Do Postnikov towers converge in the hypercomplete ∞-topos of sheaves of spaces (as in
[Lur09, §6.5]) on a replete topos?
3.2. Locally weakly contractible topoi. We brieﬂy study an exceptionally well-behaved subclass of re-
plete topoi:
Deﬁnition 3.2.1. An object F of a topos X is called weakly contractible if every surjection G →F has a
section. We say that X is locally weakly contractible if it has enough weakly contractible coherent objects,
i.e., each X ∈X admits a surjection ∪iYi →X with Yi a coherent weakly contractible object.
The pro-´etale topology will give rise to such topoi. A more elementary example is:
17

Example 3.2.2. The topos X = Set is locally weakly contractible: the singleton set S is weakly contractible
coherent, and every set is covered by a disjoint union of copies of S.
The main completeness and ﬁniteness properties of such topoi are:
Proposition 3.2.3. Let X be a locally weakly contractible topos. Then
(1) X is replete.
(2) The derived category D(X) = D(X, Z) is compactly generated.
(3) Postnikov towers converge in the associated hypercomplete ∞-topos. (Cf. [Lur09].)
Proof. For (1), note that a map F →G in X is surjective if and only if F(Y ) →G(Y ) is so for each weakly
contractible Y ; the repleteness condition is then immediately deduced. For (2), given j : Y →1X in X with
Y weakly contractible coherent, one checks that Hom(j!Z, −) = H0(Y, −) commutes with arbitrary direct
sums in D(X), so j!Z is compact; as Y varies, this gives a generating set of D(X) by assumption on X,
proving the claim. For (3), ﬁrst note that the functor F 7→F(Y ) is exact on sheaves of spaces whenever Y
is weakly contractible. Hence, given such an F and point ∗∈F(Y ) with Y weakly contractible, one has
πi(F(Y ), ∗) = πi(F, ∗)(Y ). This shows that F ≃limn τ≤nF on X, which proves hypercompleteness. (Cf.
[Lur09, Proposition 7.2.1.10].)
□
3.3. Derived categories, Postnikov towers, and cohomological descent. We ﬁrst recall the following
deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 3.3.1. Given a topos X, we deﬁne the left-completion bD(X) of D(X) as the full subcategory of
D(XN) spanned by projective systems {Kn} satisfying:
(1) Kn ∈D≥−n(X).
(2) The map τ ≥−nKn+1 →Kn induced by the transition map Kn+1 →Kn and (1) is an equivalence.
We say that D(X) is left-complete if the map τ : D(X) →bD(X) deﬁned by K 7→{τ ≥−nK} is an
equivalence.
Left-completeness is extremely useful in accessing an unbounded derived category as Postnikov towers
converge:
Lemma 3.3.2. The functor R lim : bD(X) ֒→D(XN) →D(X) provides a right adjoint to τ. In particular,
if D(X) is left-complete, then K ≃R lim τ ≥−nK for any K ∈D(X).
Proof. Fix K ∈D(X) and {Ln} ∈bD(X). Then we claim that
RHomD(X)(K, R lim Ln) ≃R lim RHomD(X)(K, Ln) ≃R lim RHomD(X)(τ ≥−nK, Ln)
≃RHom b
D(X)(τ(K), {Ln}).
This clearly sufﬁces to prove the lemma. Moreover, the ﬁrst two equalities are formal. For the last one,
recall that if F, G ∈Ab(XN), then there is an exact sequence
1 →Hom(F, G) →
Y
n
Hom(Fn, Gn) →
Y
n
Hom(Fn+1, Gn),
where the ﬁrst map is the obvious one, while the second map is the difference of the two maps Fn+1 →
Fn →Gn and Fn+1 →Gn+1 →Gn. One can check that if F, G ∈Ch(XN), and G is chosen to be
K-injective, then the above sequence gives an exact triangle
RHom(F, G) →
Y
n
RHom(Fn, Gn) →
Y
n
RHom(Fn+1, Gn).
In the special case where F, G ∈bD(X), one has RHom(Fn+1, Gn) = RHom(Fn, Gn) by adjointness of
truncations, which gives the desired equality.
□
Classically studied topoi have left-complete derived categories only under (local) ﬁnite cohomological
dimension constraints; see Proposition 3.3.7 for a criterion, and Example 3.3.5 for a typical example of the
failure of left-completeness for the simplest inﬁnite-dimensional objects. The situation for replete topoi is
much better:
18

Proposition 3.3.3. If X is a replete topos, then D(X) is left-complete.
Proof. We repeatedly use the following fact: limits and colimits in the abelian category Ch(Ab(X)) are
computed termwise. First, we show that τ : D(X) →bD(X) is fully faithful. By the adjunction from Lemma
3.3.2, it sufﬁces to show that K ≃R lim τ ≥−nK for any K ∈D(X). Choose a complex I ∈Ch(Ab(X))
lifting K ∈D(X). Then Q
n τ ≥−nI ∈Ch(Ab(X)) lifts the derived product Q
n τ ≥−nK ∈D(X) by
Proposition 3.1.9. Since I ≃lim τ ≥−nI ∈Ch(Ab(X)), it sufﬁces as in Proposition 3.1.10 to show that
Y
n
τ ≥−nI t−id
→
Y
n
τ ≥−nI
is surjective in Ch(Ab(X)), where we write t for the transition maps. Since surjectivity in Ch(Ab(X))
can be checked termwise, this follows from the proof of Proposition 3.1.10 as τ ≥−nI t−id
→τ ≥−(n−1)I is
termwise surjective.
For essential surjectivity of τ, it sufﬁces to show: given {Kn} ∈bD(X), one has Kn ≃τ ≥−nR lim Kn.
Choose a K-injective complex {In} ∈Ch(Ab(XN)) representing {Kn}. Then Q
n In ∈Ch(Ab(X)) lifts
Q
n Kn (the derived product). Moreover, by K-injectivity, the transition maps In+1 →In are (termwise)
surjective. Hence, the map
Y
n
In
t−id
→
Y
n
In
in Ch(Ab(X)) is surjective by the argument in the proof of Proposition 3.1.10, and its kernel complex K
computes R lim Kn. We must show that Hi(K) ≃Hi(Ki) for each i ∈N. Calculating cohomology and
using the assumption {Kn} ∈bD(X) ⊂D(XN) shows that
Hi(
Y
n
In) =
Y
n
Hi(In) =
Y
n≥i
Hi(In) =
Y
n≥i
Hi(Ki)
for each i ∈N; here we crucially use Proposition 3.1.9 to distribute Hi over Q. The map Hi(t −id) is
then easily seen to be split surjective with kernel lim Hi(Kn) ≃lim Hi(Ki) ≃Hi(Ki), which proves the
claim.
□
If repleteness is dropped, it is easy to give examples where D(X) is not left-complete.
Example 3.3.4. Let G = Q
n≥1 Zp, and let X be the topos associated to the category B(G) of ﬁnite G-sets
(topologized in the usual way). We will show that D(X) is not left-complete. More precisely, we will show
that K →bK := R lim τ ≥−nK does not have a section for K = ⊕n≥1Z/pn[n] ∈D(X); here Z/pn is given
the trivial G-action.
For each open subgroup H ⊂G, we write XH ∈B(G) for the G-set G/H given the left G-action, and let
Iop ⊂B(G) be the (coﬁltered) full subcategory spanned by the XH’s. The functor p∗(F) = colimI F(XH)
commutes with ﬁnite limits and all small colimits, and hence comes from a point p : ∗→X. Deriving gives
p∗L = colimI RΓ(XH, L) for any L ∈D(X), and so H0(p∗L) = colimI H0(XH, L). In particular, if
L1 →L2 has a section, so does
colim
I
H0(XH, L1) →colim
I
H0(XH, L2).
If π : X →Set denotes the constant map, then K = π∗K′ where K′ = ⊕n≥1Z/pn[n] ∈D(Ab), so
colim
I
H0(XH, K) = H0(p∗K) = H0(p∗π∗K′) = H0(K′) = 0.
Since τ ≥−nK ≃⊕i≤nZ/pi[i] ≃Q
i≤n Z/pi[i], commuting limits shows that bK ≃Q
n≥1 Z/pn[n] (where
the product is derived), and so RΓ(XH, bK) ≃Q
n≥1 RΓ(XH, Z/pn[n]). In particular, it sufﬁces to show
that
H0(p∗bK) = colim
I
Y
n≥1
Hn(XH, Z/pn)
is not 0. Let αn ∈Hn(XG, Z/pn) = Hn(X, Z/pn) be the pullback of a generator of Hn(B(Qn
i=1 Zp), Z/pn) ≃
⊗n
i=1H1(B(Zp), Z/pn) under the projection fn : G →Qn
i=1 Zp. Then αn has exact order pn as fn has a
section, so α := (αn) ∈Q
n≥1 Hn(X, Z/pn) has inﬁnite order. Its image α′ in H0(p∗bK) is 0 if and only
19

if there exists an open normal subgroup H ⊂G such that α restricts to 0 in Q
n Hn(XH, Z/pn). Since
XH →XG is a ﬁnite cover of degree [G : H], a transfer argument then implies that α is annihilated by
[G : H], which is impossible, whence α′ ̸= 0.
Remark 3.3.5. The argument of Example 3.3.4 is fairly robust: it also applies to the ´etale topos of X =
Spec(k) with k a ﬁeld provided there exist Mn ∈Ab(X´et) for inﬁnitely many n ≥1 such that Hn(X, Mn)
admits a class αn with lim ord(αn) = ∞. In particular, this shows that D(Spec(k)´et) is not left-complete
for k = C(x1, x2, x3, . . . ).
Thanks to left-completeness, cohomological descent in a replete topos is particularly straightforward:
Proposition 3.3.6. Let f : X• →X be a hypercover in a replete topos X. Then
(1) The adjunction id →f∗f ∗is an equivalence on D(X).
(2) The adjunction f!f ∗→id is an equivalence on D(X).
(3) f ∗induces an equivalence D(X) ≃Dcart(X•).
Here we write D(Y ) = D(Ab(X/Y )) for any Y ∈X. Then D(X•) is the derived category of the
simplicial topos deﬁned by X•, and Dcart(X•) is the full subcategory spanned by complexes K which are
Cartesian, i.e., for any map s : [n] →[m] in ∆, the transition maps s∗(K|Xn) →K|Xm are equivalences.
The usual pushforward then gives f∗: D(X•) →D(X) right adjoint to the pullback f ∗: D(X) →
D(X•) given informally via (f ∗K)|Xn = K|Xn. By the adjoint functor theorem, there is a left adjoint
f! : D(X•) →D(X) as well. When restricted to Dcart(X•), one may describe f! informally as follows.
For each Cartesian K and any map s : [n] →[m] in ∆, the equivalence s∗(K|Xn) ≃K|Xm has an adjoint
map K|Xm →s!(K|Xn). Applying !-pushforward along each Xn →X then deﬁnes a simplicial object in
D(X) whose homotopy-colimit computes f!K.
Proof. We freely use that homotopy-limits and homotopy-colimits in D(X•) are computed “termwise.”
Moreover, for any map g : Y →X in X, the pullback g∗is exact and commutes with such limits and
colimits (as it has a left adjoint g! and a right adjoint g∗). Hence f ∗: D(X) →D(X•) also commutes with
such limits and colimits.
(1) For any K ∈Ab(X), one has K ≃f∗f ∗K by the hypercover condition. Passing to ﬁltered colimits
shows the same for K ∈D+(X). For general K ∈D(X), we have K ≃R lim τ ≥−nK by
repleteness. By exactness of f ∗and repleteness of each Xn, one has f ∗K ≃R lim f ∗τ ≥−nK.
Pushing forward then proves the claim.
(2) This follows formally from (1) by adjunction.
(3) The functor f ∗: D(X) →Dcart(X•) is fully faithful by (1) and adjunction. Hence, it sufﬁces to
show that any K ∈Dcart(X•) comes from D(X). The claim is well-known for K ∈D+
cart(X•)
(without assuming repleteness). For general K, by repleteness, we have K ≃R lim τ ≥−nK. Since
the condition of being Cartesian on a complex is a condition on cohomology sheaves, the truncations
τ ≥−nK are Cartesian, and hence come from D(X). The claim follows as D(X) ⊂D(X•) is closed
under homotopy-limits.
□
We end by recording a ﬁnite dimensionality criterion for left-completeness:
Proposition 3.3.7. Let X be a topos, and ﬁx K ∈D(X).
(1) Given U ∈X with Γ(U, −) exact, one has RΓ(U, K) ≃R lim RΓ(U, τ ≥−nK).
(2) If there exists d ∈N such that Hi(K) has cohomological dimension ≤d locally on X for all i, then
D(X) is left-complete.
Proof. For (1), by exactness, RΓ(U, K) is computed by I(U) where I ∈Ch(X) is any chain complex rep-
resenting K. Now D(Ab) is left-complete, so I(U) ≃R lim τ ≥−nI(U). As Γ(U, −) is exact, it commutes
with truncations, so the claim follows. (2) follows from [Sta, Tag 0719].
□
3.4. Derived completions of f-adic rings in a replete topos. In this section, we ﬁx a replete topos X, and
a ring R ∈X with an ideal I ⊂R that is locally ﬁnitely generated, i.e., there exists a cover {Ui →1X} such
that I|Ui is generated by ﬁnitely many sections of I(Ui). Given U ∈X, x ∈R(U) and K ∈D(X/U, R),
we write T(K, x) := R lim(· · · x→K
x→K
x→K) ∈D(X/U, R).
20

Deﬁnition 3.4.1. We say that M ∈ModR is classically I-complete if M ≃lim M/InM; write ModR,comp ⊂
ModR for the full subcategory of such M. We say that K ∈D(X, R) is derived I-complete if for each
U ∈X and x ∈I(U), we have T(K|U, x) = 0; write Dcomp(X, R) ⊂D(X, R) for the full subcategory of
such K.
It is easy to see that Dcomp(X, R) is a triangulated subcategory of D(X, R). Moreover, for any U ∈X, the
restriction D(X, R) →D(X/U, R) commutes with homotopy-limits, and likewise for R-modules. Hence,
both the above notions of completeness localise on X. Our goal is to compare these completeness conditions
for modules, and relate completeness of a complex to that of its cohomology groups. The main result for
modules is:
Proposition 3.4.2. An R-module M ∈ModR is classically I-complete if and only if it is I-adically sepa-
rated and derived I-complete.
Remark 3.4.3. The conditions of Proposition 3.4.2 are not redundant: there exist derived I-complete R-
modules M which are not I-adically separated, and hence not classically complete. In fact, there exists a
ring R with principal ideals I and J such that R is classically I-complete while the quotient R/J is not
I-adically separated; note that R/J = cok(R →R) is derived I-complete by Lemma 3.4.14.
The result for complexes is:
Proposition 3.4.4. An R-complex K ∈D(X, R) is derived I-complete if and only if each Hi(K) is so.
Remark 3.4.5. For X = Set, one can ﬁnd Proposition 3.4.4 in [Lur11].
Lemma 3.4.6. Given x, y ∈R(X), the sequence
0 →R[
1
x + y] →R[
1
x · (x + y)] ⊕R[
1
y · (x + y)] →R[
1
x · y · (x + y)] →0
is exact.
Proof. Using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Spec(R(U)[
1
x+y]) for each U ∈X, one ﬁnds that the corre-
sponding sequence of presheaves is exact, as (x, y) = (1) ∈R(U)[
1
x+y]; the claim follows by exactness of
sheaﬁﬁcation.
□
The main relevant consequence is that R[
1
x+y] ∈D(X, R) is represented by a ﬁnite complex whose terms
are direct sums of ﬁltered colimits of free R[ 1
x]-modules and R[ 1
y]-modules.
Lemma 3.4.7. Fix K ∈D(X, R) and x ∈R(X). Then T(K, x) = 0 if and only if RHomR(M, K) = 0 for
M ∈D(X, R[ 1
x]).
Proof. The backwards direction follows by setting M = R[ 1
x] and using R[ 1
x] = colim

. For the forward direction, let C ⊂D(X, R[ 1
x]) be the triangulated subcategory of all M for which
RHomR(M, K) = 0. Then C is closed under arbitrary direct sums, and R[ 1
x] ∈C by assumption. Since
T(K|U, x) = T(K, x)|U = 0, one also has j!(R[ 1
x]|U) ∈C for any j : U →1X. The claim now follows:
for any ringed topos (X, A), the smallest triangulated subcategory of D(X, A) closed under arbitrary direct
sums and containing j!(A|U) for j : U →1X variable is D(X, A) itself.

Lemma 3.4.8. Fix K ∈D(X, R) and x ∈I(X). Then T(K, x) lies in the essential image of D(X, R[ 1
x]) →
D(X, R).
Proof. We may represent K by a K-injective complex of R-modules. Then T(K, x) ≃RHomR(R[ 1
x], K) ≃
HomR(R[ 1
x], K) is a complex of R[ 1
x]-modules, which proves the claim.
□
Lemma 3.4.9. The inclusion Dcomp(X, R) ֒→D(X, R) admits a left adjoint K 7→bK. The natural map
bK →bbK is an equivalence.
21

Proof. The second part is a formal consequence of the ﬁrst part as the inclusion Dcomp(X, R) ⊂D(X, R)
is fully faithful. For the ﬁrst part, we ﬁrst assume I is generated by global sections x1, . . . , xr ∈I(X). For
0 ≤i ≤r, deﬁne functors Fi : D(X, R) →D(X, R) with maps Fi →Fi+1 as follows: set F0 = id, and

are given by xi+1 on the source,
and the identity on the target. One then checks using induction and lemmas 3.4.7 and 3.4.8 that Fi(K) is
derived (x1, . . . , xi)-complete, and that
RHom(Fi+1(K), L) = RHom(Fi(K), L)
if L is (x1, . . . , xi+1)-complete. It follows that K →Fr(K) provides the desired left adjoint; we rewrite
bK := Fr(K) and call it the completion of K. The construction shows that completion commutes with
restriction. In general, this argument shows that there is a hypercover f : X• →1X such that the inclu-
sion Dcomp(Xn, R) →D(Xn, R) admits a left adjoint, also called completion. As completion commtues
with restriction, the inclusion Dcart,comp(X•, R) ⊂Dcart(X•, R) of derived I-complete cartesian com-
plexes inside all cartesian complexes admits a left-adjoint Dcart(X•, R) →Dcart,comp(X•, R). The co-
homological descent equivalence f ∗: D(X, R) →D(X•, R) restricts to an equivalence Dcomp(X, R) →
Dcart,comp(X•, R), so the claim follows.
□
Lemma 3.4.9 leads to a tensor structure on Dcomp(X, R):
Deﬁnition 3.4.10. For K, L ∈D(X, R), we deﬁne the completed tensor product via K b⊗RL :=
\
K ⊗L
R L ∈
Dcomp(X, R).
The completed tensor product satisﬁes the expected adjointness:
Lemma 3.4.11. For K ∈D(X, R) and L ∈Dcomp(X, R), we have RHomR(K, L) ∈Dcomp(X, R).
Moreover, there is an adjunction
Hom(K′, RHomR(K, L)) ≃Hom(K′ b⊗RK, L)
for any K′ ∈Dcomp(X, R).
Proof. For any x ∈I(X), we have T(RHomR(K, L), x) ≃RHomR(K, T(L, x)) ≃0. Repeating this
argument for a slice topos X/U then proves the ﬁrst part. The second part is a formal consequence of the
adjunction between ⊗and RHom in D(X, R), together with the completeness of L.
□
Lemma 3.4.12. Fix K ∈D(X, R). The following are equivalent
(1) For each U ∈X and x ∈I(U), the natural map K →R lim
 K xn


is an isomorphism.
(2) K is derived I-complete.
(3) There exists a cover {Ui →1X} and generators x1, . . . , xr ∈I(Ui) such that T(K|Ui, xi) = 0.
(4) There exists a cover {Ui →1X} and generators x1, . . . , xr ∈I(Ui) such that
K|Ui ≃R lim(K|Ui ⊗L
Z[x1,...,xr] Z[x1, . . . , xr]/(xn
1, . . . , xn
r ))
via the natural map.
Proof. The equivalence of (1) and (2) follows from the observation that the transition map

K xn+1

K xn

is given by x on the ﬁrst factor, and the identity on the second factor. Also, (2) clearly implies (3). For the
converse, ﬁx a U ∈X and x ∈I(U). To show T(K|U, x) = 0, we are free to replace U with a cover. Hence,
we may assume x = P
i aixi with T(K|U, xi) = 0. Lemma 3.4.7 shows T(K|U, aixi) = 0, and Lemma
3.4.6 does the rest. Finally, since each xj acts nilpotently on K|Ui ⊗L
Z[x1,...,xr]Z[x1, . . . , xr]/(xn
1, . . . , xn
r ), it
is clear that (4) implies (3). Conversely, assume (3) holds. Replacing X with a suitable Ui, we may assume
22

I is generated by global sections x1, . . . , xr ∈I(X). Consider the sequence of functors F0, . . . , Fr :
D(X, R) →D(X, R) deﬁned in the proof of Lemma 3.4.9. As each Z[xi]/(xn
i ) is a perfect Z[xi]-module,
the functor −⊗L
Z[xi] Z[xi]/(xn
i ) commutes with homotopy-limits. Hence, we can write
K ≃Fr(K) ≃R lim(K ⊗L
Z[x1] Z[x1]/(xn
1) ⊗L
Z[x2] Z[x2]/(xn
2) ⊗· · · ⊗L
Z[xr] Z[xr]/(xn
r )),
which implies (4).
□
Lemma 3.4.13. If M ∈ModR is classically I-complete, then M is derived I-complete.
Proof. Commuting limits shows that the collection of all derived I-complete objects K ∈D(X, R) is
closed under homotopy-limits. Hence, writing M = lim M/InM ≃R lim M/InM (where the second
isomorphism uses repleteness), it sufﬁces to show that M is derived I-complete if InM = 0. For such M,
any local section x ∈I(U) for some U ∈X acts nilpotently on M|U, so T(M|U, x) = 0.
□
The cokernel of a map of classically I-complete R-modules need not be I-complete, and one can even
show that ModR,comp is not an abelian category in general. In contrast, derived I-complete modules behave
much better:
Lemma 3.4.14. The collection of all derived I-complete M ∈ModR is an abelian Serre subcategory of
ModR.
Proof. Fix a map f : M →N of derived I-complete R-modules. Then there is an exact triangle
ker(f)[1] →

M →N

→cok(f)
For any x ∈I(X), there is an exact triangle
T(ker(f)[1], x) →0 →T(cok(f), x)
where we use the assumption on M and N to get the middle term to be 0. The right hand side lies in
D≥0(X, R), while the left hand side lies in D≤0(X, R) as R lim has cohomological dimension ≤1 (as X
is replete). Chasing sequences shows that the left and right terms are also 0. Repeating the argument for a
slice topos X/U (and varying x ∈I(U)) proves that ker(f) and cok(f) are derived I-complete. It is then
immediate that im(f) = M/ker(f) is also derived I-complete. Since closure of derived I-completeness
under extensions is clear, the claim follows.
□
Proof of Proposition 3.4.4. Assume ﬁrst that each Hi(K) is derived I-complete. Then each ﬁnite truncation
τ ≤nτ ≥mK is derived I-complete. Hence, τ ≤mK ≃R lim τ ≥−nτ ≤mK is also derived I-complete for each
m; here we use that D(X) is left-complete since X is replete. For any x ∈I(X), applying T(−, x) to
τ ≤mK →K →τ ≥m+1(K).
shows that T(K, x) ≃T(τ ≥m+1K, x) ∈D≥m+1(X, R). Since this is true for all m, one has T(K, x) = 0.
Repeating the argument for x ∈I(U) for U ∈X then proves the claim.
Conversely, assume that K is derived I-complete. By shifting, it sufﬁces to show that H0(K) is derived
I-complete. Assume ﬁrst that K ∈D≤0(X, R). Then there is an exact triangle
τ ≤−1K →K →H0(K).
Fixing an x ∈I(X) and applying T(−, x) gives
T(τ ≤−1K, x) →T(K, x) →T(H0(K), x).
The left term lives in D≤0(X, R), the middle term vanishes by assumption on K, and the right term lives
in D≥0(X, R), so the claim follows by chasing sequences (and replacing X with X/U). Now applying the
same argument to the triangle
τ ≤0K →K →τ ≥1K
shows that each τ ≤0K and τ ≥1K are derived I-complete. Replacing K by τ ≤0K then proves the claim.
□
23

Proof of Proposition 3.4.2. The forward direction follows from Lemma 3.4.13. Conversely, assume M is
derived I-complete and I-adically separated. To show M is classically I-complete, we may pass to slice
topoi and assume that I is generated by global sections x1, . . . , xr ∈I(X). Then derived I-completeness of
M gives
M ≃R lim(M ⊗L
Z[x1,...,xr] Z[x1, . . . , xr]/(xn
i )).
Calculating H0(M) ≃M via the Milnor exact sequence (which exists by repleteness) gives
1 →R1 lim H−1(M ⊗L
Z[x1,...,xr] Z[x1 . . . , xr]/(xn
i )) →M →lim M/(xn
1, . . . , xn
r )M →1.
By I-adic separatedness, the last map is injective, and hence an isomorphism.

3.5. Derived completions of noetherian rings in a replete topos. In this section, we specialize the dis-
cussion of §3.4 to the noetherian constant case. More precisely, we ﬁx a replete topos X, a noetherian ring
R, and an ideal m ⊂R. We also write m ⊂R for the corresponding constant sheaves on X. Our goal is to
understand m-adic completeness for R-complexes on X.
Proposition 3.5.1. Fix K ∈D(X, R). Then
(1) K is derived m-complete if and only if K ≃R lim(K ⊗L
R R/mn) via the natural map.
(2) R lim(K ⊗L
R R/mn) is derived m-complete.
(3) The functor K 7→R lim(K ⊗L
R R/mn) deﬁnes a left adjoint D(X, R) →Dcomp(X, R) to the
inclusion.
Proof. (2) is clear as each K ⊗L
R R/mn is derived m-complete. For the rest, ﬁx generators f1, .., fr ⊂m.
Set P = Z[x1, . . . , xr], and J = (x1, . . . , xr) ⊂P. Consider the map P →R deﬁned via xi 7→fi (both in
Set and X). By Lemma 3.4.12, K is derived m-complete precisely when K ≃R lim(K ⊗L
P P/Jn) via the
natural map. For (1), it thus sufﬁces to check that
a : {P/Jn ⊗L
P R} →{R/mn}
is a strict pro-isomorphism. There is an evident identiﬁcation
{P/Jn ⊗L
P R} = {P/Jn ⊗L
P (P ⊗Z R) ⊗L
P ⊗ZR R},
where P ⊗Z R is viewed as a P-algebra via the ﬁrst factor. As P/Jn and P ⊗Z R are Tor-independent over
P, we reduce to checking that
{R[x1, . . . , xr]/(x1, . . . , xr)n ⊗L
R[x1,...,xr] R} →{R/mn}
is a strict pro-isomorphism. This follows from the Artin-Rees lemma. Finally, (3) follows from a being a
pro-isomorphism as the construction of Lemma 3.4.9 realises the m-adic completion of K as R lim(K ⊗L
P
P/Jn).
□
Proposition 3.5.1 gives a good description of the category Dcomp(X, R) of derived m-complete com-
plexes. Using this description, one can check that R itself is not derived m-complete in X in general. To
rectify this, we study the m-adic completion bR of R on X, and some related categories.
Deﬁnition 3.5.2. Deﬁne bR := lim R/mn ∈X. In particular, bR is an R-algebra equipped with R-algebra
maps bR →R/mn. An object K ∈D(X, bR) is called m-adically complete if the natural map K →
R lim(K ⊗L
bR R/mn) is an equivalence. Let i : Dcomp(X, bR) ֒→D(X, bR) be the full subcategory of such
complexes.
Our immediate goal is to describe m-adically complete complexes in terms of their truncations. To this
end, we introduce the following category of compatible systems:
Deﬁnition 3.5.3. Let C = Fun(Nop, X) be the topos of Nop-indexed projective systems {Fn} in X. Let
R• = {R/mn} ∈C be the displayed sheaf of rings, and let Dcomp(C, R•) ⊂D(C, R•) be the full subcate-
gory spanned by complexes {Kn} such that the induced maps Kn⊗L
R/mnR/mn−1 →Kn−1 are equivalences
for all n.
24

Lemma 3.5.4. For {Kn} ∈D−(C, R•), one has an identiﬁcation of pro-objects {Kn ⊗L
R R/m} ≃
{Kn ⊗L
R/mn R/m}, and hence a limiting isomorphism R lim(Kn ⊗L
R R/m) ≃R lim(Kn ⊗L
R/mn R/m).
If m is regular, this extends to unbounded complexes.
Proof. Change of rings gives {Kn ⊗L
R R/m} ≃{Kn ⊗L
R/mn R/mn ⊗L
R R/m}. The Artin-Rees lemma
shows that {R/mn ⊗L
R R/m} →{R/m} is a pro-isomorphism. Since {Kn} is bounded above, the spectral
sequence for Tor has only ﬁnitely many contributing terms to a given E∞-term, and hence
{Kn ⊗L
R R/m} ≃{Kn ⊗L
R/mn R/mn ⊗L
R R/m} →{Kn ⊗L
R/mn R/m}
is also a pro-isomorphism.
Applying R lim and using repleteness then gives the claim.
Finally, if m
is generated by a regular sequence (f1, . . . , fr), then {R/mn} is pro-isomorphic to {R/(f n
1 , . . . , f n
r )}.
Each quotient R/(f n
1 , . . . , f n
r ) is R-perfect, and hence the Tor-spectral sequence calculating Hi(K ⊗L
R
R/(f n
1 , . . . , f n
r )) has only ﬁnitely many non-zero terms even when K is unbounded, so the preceding argu-
ment applies.
□
Lemma 3.5.5. For {Kn} ∈D−
comp(C, R•), the natural map gives (R lim Kn) ⊗L
R R/mk ≃Kk for k ≥0.
If m is regular, this extends to unbounded complexes.
Proof. By devissage and the completeness of {Kn}, we may assume k = 1. By shifting, we can also assume
{Kn} ∈D≤0(C), i.e., Kn ∈D≤0(X) for all n. Fix an integer i ≥0, and an R-perfect complex Pi with a
map Pi →R/m whose cone lies in D≤−i(R). Then there is a commutative diagram
(R lim Kn) ⊗L
R Pi

b

R lim(Kn ⊗R Pi)
d

(R lim Kn) ⊗L
R R/m
c
/ R lim(Kn ⊗R R/m) ≃K1.
The isomorphism on the bottom right is due to Lemma 3.5.4. As Pi is perfect, a is an isomorphism.
Moreover, cok(b) ∈D≤−i+1(X) as R lim Kn ∈D≤1(X) by repleteness. A similar argument also shows
cok(d) ∈D≤−i+1(X). Hence, cok(c) ∈D≤−i+1(X). Then c must be an isomorphism as this is true for all
i.
□
We can now show that the two notions of completeness coincide:
Lemma 3.5.6. For each m, the natural map induces bR⊗L
R R/mm ≃R/mm. In particular, Dcomp(X, bR) ≃
Dcomp(X, R).
Proof. The ﬁrst part follows from Lemma 3.5.5. The second part follows formally from this and Proposition
3.5.1.
□
We now show that an m-adically complete complex is determined by its reductions modulo powers of m;
this will be used later to compare complexes on the pro-´etale site to Ekedahl’s category of adic complexes.
Lemma 3.5.7. With notation as above, we have:
(1) There is a map π : (C, R•) →(X, bR) of ringed topoi given by π∗({Fn}) = lim Fn with π−1 bR →R•
the natural map.
(2) Pullback under π induces a fully faithful functor π∗: Dcomp(X, bR) →Dcomp(C, R•).
(3) Pushforward under π induces a fully faithful functor π∗: D−
comp(C, R•) →D−
comp(X, bR).
(4) π induces an equivalence D−
comp(X, bR) ≃D−
comp(C, R•).
(5) If m is regular, then (3) and (4) extend to the unbounded case.
Proof. (1) is clear. The functor π∗: D(X, bR) →D(C, R•) is given by K 7→{K ⊗bR R/mn}, while
π∗: D(C, R•) →D(X, bR) is given by π∗({Kn}) ≃R lim Kn. It is then clear that π∗carries com-
plete complexes to complete ones. Given {Kn} ∈Dcomp(C, R•), each Kn ∈D(X, R/mn) is derived
m-complete, and hence π∗preserves completeness as well (since π∗{Kn} := R lim Kn is m-adically com-
plete). For (2), it then sufﬁces to check that K ≃R lim(K ⊗L
bR R/mn) for any K ∈Dcomp(X, bR), which is
true by Proposition 3.5.1. Lemma 3.5.5 and (2) immediately give (3), and hence (4). Finally, (5) follows by
25

the same argument as (3) as all the ingredients in the proof of the latter extend to the unbounded setting if m
is regular.

4. THE PRO-´ETALE TOPOLOGY
We deﬁne the pro-´etale site of a scheme in §4.1, and study the associated topos in §4.2. In §4.3, we use
these ideas to construct a variant of Tate’s continuous cohomology of proﬁnite groups that behaves better in
some functorial respects.
4.1. The site.
Deﬁnition 4.1.1. A map f : Y →X of schemes is called weakly ´etale if f is ﬂat and ∆f : Y →Y ×X Y
is ﬂat. Write Xpro´et for the category of weakly ´etale X-schemes, which we give the structure of a site by
declaring a cover to be one that is a cover in the fpqc topology, i.e. a family {Yi →Y } of maps in Xpro´et is
a covering family if any open afﬁne in Y is mapped onto by an open afﬁne in ⊔iYi.
Remark 4.1.2. To avoid set-theoretic issues, it sufﬁces for our purposes to deﬁne the site Xpro´et using
weakly ´etale maps Y →X with |Y | < κ, where κ is a ﬁxed uncountable strong limit cardinal larger
than |X|.5 The choice of κ is dictated by the desire to have Shv(Xpro´et) be locally weakly contractible.
Increasing κ results in a different topos, but cohomology remains the same, as it can be calculated by a
simplicial covering with w-contractible schemes.
Remark 4.1.3. We do not directly work with pro-´etale morphisms of schemes to deﬁne Xpro´et as the
property of being pro-´etale is not geometric: Example 4.1.12 shows its failure to localise on the target.
Nonetheless, we call Xpro´et the pro-´etale site, as by Theorem 2.3.4 any weakly ´etale map f : Y →X is
Zariski locally on X and locally in Ypro´et of the form SpecB →SpecA with A →B ind-´etale.
Some elementary examples of weakly ´etale maps:
Example 4.1.4. For a ﬁeld k, a map Spec(R) →Spec(k) is weakly ´etale if and only if k →R is ind-´etale.
Indeed, R embeds into some ind-´etale k-algebra S; but one checks easily that as k is a ﬁeld, any subalgebra
of an ind-´etale k-algebra is again ind-´etale.
Example 4.1.5. For a scheme X and a geometric point x, the map Spec(Osh
X,x) →X from the strict
henselization is weakly ´etale; similarly, the henselization and Zariski localizations are also weakly ´etale.
We begin by recording some basic generalities on pro-´etale maps.
Lemma 4.1.6. Compositions and base changes of weakly ´etale maps are weakly ´etale.
Proof. Clear.
□
Lemma 4.1.7. Any map in Xpro´et is weakly ´etale.
Proof. This follows from Proposition 2.3.3 (iv).
□
The previous observations give good categorical properties for Xpro´et:
Lemma 4.1.8. The category Xpro´et has ﬁnite limits, while the full subcategory spanned by afﬁne weakly
´etale maps Y →X has all small limits. All limits in question agree with those in Sch/X.
Proof. For the ﬁrst part, it sufﬁces to show that Xpro´et has a ﬁnal object and arbitrary ﬁbre products. Clearly
X is a ﬁnal object. Moreover, if Y1 →Y2 ←Y3 is a diagram in Xpro´et, then both maps in the composition
Y1 ×Y2 Y3 →Yi →X are weakly ´etale for any i ∈{1, 2, 3} by the previous lemmas, proving the claim. For
the second part, the same argument as above shows ﬁnite limits exist. Hence, it sufﬁces to check that small
coﬁltered limits exist, but this is clear: the limit of a coﬁltered diagram of afﬁne weakly ´etale X-schemes is
an afﬁne X-scheme that is weakly ´etale over X as ﬂatness is preserved under ﬁltered colimits of rings.
□
We record an example of a typical “new” object in Xpro´et:
Example 4.1.9. The category Xpro´et is “tensored over” proﬁnite sets, i.e., given a proﬁnite set S and Y ∈
Xpro´et, one can deﬁne Y ⊗S ∈Xpro´et as follows. Given S = limi Si as a coﬁltered limit of ﬁnite sets, we
obtain constant X-schemes Si ∈X´et ⊂Xpro´et with value Si. Set S = limi Si, and Y ⊗S := Y ×X S. If
X is qcqs, then for any ﬁnitely presented X-scheme U, one has HomX(Y ⊗S, U) = colimi HomX(Y ⊗
5Recall that a cardinal κ is a strong limit cardinal if for any γ < κ, 2γ < κ.
27

Si, U) = colimi
Q
Si HomX(Y, U). The association S 7→S deﬁnes a limit preserving functor from proﬁnite
sets to Xpro´et.
Using these objects, we can describe the pro-´etale site of a ﬁeld explicitly:
Example 4.1.10. Fix a ﬁeld k. If k is a separable closure, then the qcqs objects in Spec(k)pro´et identify with
the category of proﬁnite sets via the functor Y 7→Y (k) with inverse S 7→S (in the notation of Example
4.1.9). The map Spec(k) →Spec(k) is a weakly ´etale G-torsor, so the qcqs objects in Spec(k)pro´et identify
with pro-objects in the category of ﬁnite discrete G-sets, i.e., with the category of proﬁnite continuous G-
sets. Under this identiﬁcation, a family {Si →S} of continuous G-equivariant map of such sets is a covering
family if there exists a ﬁnite subset J of the indices such that ⊔j∈JSj →S is surjective. To see this, we may
assume k = k. Given such a family {Si →S}, the corresponding map ⊔j∈JSj →S is a surjective weakly
´etale map of afﬁnes, so {Si →S} is a covering family in Spec(k)pro´et; the converse is clear. Evaluation on
S is exact precisely when S is extremally disconnected; note that this functor is not a topos-theoretic point
as it does not commute with ﬁnite coproducts (though it does commute with ﬁltered colimits and all limits).
Remark 4.1.11. The site Xpro´et introduced in this paper differs from the one in [Sch13], temporarily de-
noted X′
pro´et. More precisely, there is a natural map µX : Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(X′
pro´et) of topoi, but µX
is not an equivalence: µX,∗is fully faithful, but there are more objects in Shv(X′
pro´et). This is evident
from the deﬁnition, and can be seen directly in Example 4.1.10 when X = Spec(k) with k an algebraically
closed ﬁeld. Indeed, both the categories Xpro´et and X′
pro´et are identiﬁed with the category of proﬁnite sets,
but Xpro´et has more covers than X′
pro´et: all objects of X′
pro´et are weakly contractible, while the weakly
contractible ones in Xpro´et are exactly the ones corresponding to extremally disconnected proﬁnite sets.
The following example (due to de Jong) shows that the property of being pro-´etale is not Zariski local on
the target, and hence explains why weakly ´etale maps give a more geometric notion:
Example 4.1.12. Let S′ be an inﬁnite set with an automorphism T ′ : S′ →S′ which does not stabilize any
ﬁnite subset; for example, S′ = Z, and T ′(n) = n + 1. Write (S, 0) for the one point compactiﬁcation of S′
and T : S →S for the induced automorphism (which has a unique ﬁxed point at 0); note that S is proﬁnite,
and the unique non-empty clopen subset of S stable under T is S itself. Let X ⊂A2
C be the union of
two irreducible smooth curves X1 and X2 meeting transversely at points p and q; note that X is connected.
Glueing S ⊗X1 ∈X1,pro´et to S ⊗X2 ∈X2,pro´et using the identity at p and T at q gives Y ∈Xpro´et. We
claim that Y is not pro-´etale over X. Assume otherwise that Y = limi Yi →X with fi : Yi →X ´etale. Let
0 : X →Y be the zero section, deﬁned using 0 ∈S. Then the assumption on Y shows that 0(X) = ∩Ui
with Ui ⊂Y a clopen subset (pulled back from a clopen of Yi). Now any clopen subset U ⊂Y deﬁnes a
clopen subset Up ⊂S that is stable under T, so Up = S is the only possibility by choice of S and T; this
gives {0} = 0(X)p = ∩iS = S, which is absurd.
We end by giving examples of covers in Xpro´et.
Example 4.1.13. Given a scheme X and closed geometric points x1, . . . , xn, the map

⊔i Spec(Osh
X,xi)

⊔

X −{x1, . . . , xn}

→X
is a weakly ´etale cover. However, one cannot add inﬁnitely points. For example, the map
⊔pSpec(Zsh
(p)) →Spec(Z)
is not a weakly ´etale cover as the target is not covered by a quasicompact open in the source.
4.2. The topos. To effectively study Shv(Xpro´et), we single out a special class of weakly ´etale morphisms
to serve as generators:
Deﬁnition 4.2.1. Fix a scheme X. An object U ∈Xpro´et is called a pro-´etale afﬁne if we can write
U = limi Ui for a small coﬁltered diagram i 7→Ui of afﬁne schemes in X´et; the expression U = limi Ui is
called a presentation for U, and we often implicitly assume that the indexing category has a ﬁnal object 0.
The full subcategory of Xpro´et spanned by pro-´etale afﬁnes is denoted Xaﬀ
pro´et.
28

We remark that each U ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et is, in particular, an afﬁne scheme pro-´etale over X.
Lemma 4.2.2. Any map in Xaﬀ
pro´et is pro-(afﬁne ´etale).
Proof. Fix a map h : U →V in Xaﬀ
pro´et, and presentations U = limi Ui and V = limj Vj as pro-´etale afﬁnes.
Then, after changing the presentation for U, we may assume that X = V0 is an afﬁne scheme Spec(A). The
claim now follows from the observation that a map between ind-´etale A-algebras is also ind-´etale.
□
Remark 4.2.3. By Lemma 4.2.2, the category Xaﬀ
pro´et admits limits indexed by a connected diagram, and
these agree with those in Sch/X. However, this category does not have a ﬁnal object (unless X is afﬁne) or
non-empty ﬁnite products (unless X has an afﬁne diagonal).
The reason to introduce pro-´etale afﬁnes is:
Lemma 4.2.4. The site Xpro´et is subcanonical, and the topos Shv(Xpro´et) is generated by Xaﬀ
pro´et.
Proof. The ﬁrst part comes from fpqc descent. The second assertion means that any Y ∈Xpro´et admits a
surjection ⊔iUi →Y in Xpro´et with Ui ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et, which follows from Theorem 2.3.4.
□
We record some consequences of the above observations on pro-´etale maps for the pro-´etale site:
Remark 4.2.5. Assume X is an afﬁne scheme. Then Xaﬀ
pro´et is simply the category of all afﬁne schemes
pro-´etale over X; this category admits all small limits, and becomes a site with covers deﬁned to be fpqc
covers. Lemma 4.2.4 then shows that Shv(Xpro´et) ≃Shv(Xaﬀ
pro´et).
Lemma 4.2.6. A presheaf F on Xpro´et is a sheaf if and only if:
(1) For any surjection V →U in Xaﬀ
pro´et, the sequence F(U) →F(V )
// F(V ×U V ) is exact.
(2) The presheaf F is a Zariski sheaf.
Proof. The forward direction is clear. Conversely, assume F is a presheaf satisfying (1) and (2), and ﬁx a
cover Z →Y in Xpro´et. Using (1) and (2), one readily checks the sheaf axiom in the special case where
Y ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et, and Z = ⊔iWi with Wi ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et. In the case of a general cover, Lemma 4.2.4 shows that we
can ﬁnd a diagram
⊔j∈JUj
a
/
b

Z
c

⊔i∈IVi
d
/ Y
where d is a Zariski cover, a and b are covers in Xpro´et, and Uj, Vi ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et with b determined by a map
h : J →I of index sets together with maps Uj →Vh(j) in Xaﬀ
pro´et. The previous reduction and (2) give the
sheaf axiom for b and d, and hence d ◦b as well. It formally follows that F(Y ) →F(Z) is injective, and
hence that F(Z) →Q
i F(Ui) is also injective by (2) as a is a cover. A diagram chase then shows that the
sheaf axiom for c follows from that for c ◦a.
□
Lemma 4.2.7. For any Y ∈Xpro´et, pullback induces an identiﬁcation Shv(Xpro´et)/Y ≃Shv(Ypro´et).
Proof. A composition of weakly ´etale maps is weakly ´etale, and any map between weakly ´etale maps is
weakly ´etale.
□
The pro-´etale topos is locally weakly contractible in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.2.1.
Proposition 4.2.8. For any scheme X, the topos Shv(Xpro´et) is locally weakly contractible.
Proof. This follows immediately from Lemma 2.4.9 since any afﬁne U ∈Xpro´et is coherent.
□
Remark 4.2.9. Proposition 4.2.8 gives a recipe for calculating the pro-´etale homotopy type |X| of a qcqs
scheme X. Namely, if f : X• →X is a hypercover in Xpro´et with each Xn being w-contractible, then
|X| = |π0(X•)|; any two such choices of f are homotopic, and hence |X| is well-deﬁned in the category of
simplicial proﬁnite sets up to continuous homotopy.
We give an example illustrating the behaviour of constant sheaves on the pro-´etale site:
29

Example 4.2.10. Fix a connected afﬁne scheme X, and a proﬁnite set S = limi Si with Si ﬁnite. By the
formula in Example 4.1.9, the constant sheaf A ∈Shv(Xpro´et) associated to a set A satisﬁes
A(X ⊗S) = colim
i
 ASi
.
In particular, the functor A 7→A is not compatible with inverse limits.
The following example shows classical points do not detect non-triviality in Shv(Xpro´et).
Example 4.2.11. Fix an algebraically closed ﬁeld k, and set X = Spec(k). Then Shv(Xpro´et) identiﬁes
with the topos of sheaves on the category of proﬁnite sets S as explained in Example 4.1.10. Consider the
presheaf G (resp. F) which associates to such an S the group of all locally constant (resp. all) functions
S →Λ for some abelian group Λ. Then both F and G are sheaves: this is obvious for G, and follows from
the compatibility of limits in proﬁnite sets and sets for F. Moreover, G ⊂F, and Q := F/G ∈Ab(Xpro´et)
satisﬁes Q(X) = 0, but Q(S) ̸= 0 for S not discrete.
In fact, more generally, one can deﬁne ’constant sheaves’ associated with topological spaces. Indeed, let
X be any scheme, and let T be some topological space.
Lemma 4.2.12. The association mapping any U ∈Xpro´et to Mapcont(U, T) is a sheaf FT on Xpro´et. If
T is totally disconnected and U is qcqs, then FT (U) = Mapcont(π0(U), T). In particular, if T is discrete,
then FT is the constant sheaf associated with T.
Proof. To show that FT is a sheaf, one reduces to proving that if f : A →B is a faithfully ﬂat ind-´etale
morphism of rings, then M ⊂SpecA is open if and only if (Specf)−1(M) ⊂SpecB is open. Only the
converse is nontrivial, so assume (Specf)−1(M) ⊂SpecB is open. First, we claim that M is open in
the constructible topology. Indeed, the map Specf : SpecB →SpecA is a continuous map of compact
Hausdorff spaces when considering the constructible topologies. In particular, it is closed, so
SpecA \ M = (Specf)(SpecB \ (Specf)−1(M))
is closed, and thus M is open (in the constructible topology). To check that M is actually open, it is enough
to verify that M is closed under generalizations. This is clear, as Specf is generalizing, and (Specf)−1(M)
is open (and thus closed under generalizations).
If T is totally disconnected and U is qcqs, then any continuous map U →T will necessarily factor
through the projection U →π0(U), so that FT (U) = Mapcont(π0(U), T).
□
We relate sheaves on X with sheaves on its space π0(X) of connected components. Recall that if X is a
qcqs scheme, then π0(X) is a proﬁnite set. If π0(X)pro´et denotes the site of proﬁnite π0(X)-sets as in Ex-
ample 4.1.10, then the construction of Lemma 2.2.8 deﬁnes a limit-preserving functor π−1 : π0(X)pro´et →
Xpro´et which respects coverings. Hence, one has an induced map π : Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(π0(X)pro´et) of
topoi. This map satisﬁes:
Lemma 4.2.13. Assume X is qcqs, and let π : Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(π0(X)pro´et) be as above. Then
(1) π∗F(U) = F(π0(U)) for any qcqs U ∈Xpro´et and F ∈Shv(π0(X)pro´et).
(2) π∗commutes with limits.
(3) π∗is fully faithful, so π∗π∗≃id.
(4) π∗identiﬁes Shv(π0(X)pro´et) with the full subcategory of those G ∈Shv(Xpro´et) such that G(U) =
G(V ) for any map U →V of qcqs objects in Xpro´et inducing an isomorphism on π0.
Proof. All schemes appearing in this proof are assumed qcqs. (2) is automatic from (1). For (1), ﬁx some
F ∈Shv(π0(X)pro´et). As any continuous π0(X)-map U →S with U ∈Xpro´et and S ∈π0(X)pro´et
factors canonically through π0(U), the sheaf π∗F is the sheaﬁﬁcation of the presheaf U 7→F(π0(U))
on U ∈Xpro´et. As F is itself a sheaf on π0(X)pro´et, it is enough to check: for a surjection U →V
in Xpro´et, the map π0(U) →π0(V ) is the coequalizer of the two maps π0(U ×V U) →π0(U) in the
category of proﬁnite sets (induced by the two projection maps U ×V U →U). For any proﬁnite set S,
one has (S ⊗X)(U) = Mapcont(π0(U), S) with notation as in Example 4.1.9, so the claim follows from
the representability of S ⊗X and fpqc descent. For (3), it sufﬁces to check that π∗π∗F ≃F for any
F ∈Shv(π0(X)pro´et), which is immediate from Lemma 2.2.8 and (2). For (4), by (2), it remains to
30

check that any G with the property of (4) satisﬁes G ≃π∗π∗G. Given U ∈Xpro´et, we have a canonical
factorization U →π−1(π0(U)) →X, where π−1(π0(U)) →X is a pro-(ﬁnite ´etale) map inducing
π0(U) →π0(X) on connected components, while U →π−1(π0(U)) is an isomorphism on π0. Then
G(U) = G(π−1(π0(U))) by assumption on G, which proves G = π∗π∗G by (2).
□
Remark 4.2.14. The conclusion of Lemma 4.2.13 fails for π : Shv(X´et) →Shv(π0(X)´et). Indeed, if X
is connected, then Shv(π0(X)´et) = Set, and π∗coincides with the “constant sheaf” functor, which is not
always limit-preserving.
4.3. The case of a point. Fix a proﬁnite group G. We indicate how the deﬁnition of the pro-´etale site
can be adapted to give a site BGpro´et of proﬁnite G-sets. In particular, each topological G-module M
deﬁnes a sheaf FM on BGpro´et, and the resulting functor from topological G-modules to abelian sheaves on
BGpro´et is an embedding with dense image (in the sense of colimits). We use this construction to study the
cohomology theory M 7→RΓ(BGpro´et, FM) on G-modules: this theory is equal to continuous cohomology
in many cases of interest, and yet better behaved in some functorial respects. The deﬁnition is:
Deﬁnition 4.3.1. Let BGpro´et be the pro-´etale site of G, deﬁned as the site of proﬁnite continuous G-sets
with covers given by continuous surjections.
For S ∈BGpro´et, we use hS ∈Shv(BGpro´et) to denote the associated sheaf. Let G-Spc be the category
of topological spaces with a continuous G-action; recall that G-Spc admits limits and colimits, and the
formation of these commutes with passage to the underlying spaces (and thus the underlying sets). Let
G-Spccg ⊂G-Spc be the full subcategory of X ∈G-Spc whose underlying space may be written as a
quotient of a disjoint union of compact Hausdorff spaces; we call these spaces compactly generated. There
is a tight connection between these categories and Shv(BGpro´et):
Lemma 4.3.2. Let notation be as above.
(1) The association X 7→Mapcont,G(−, X) gives a functor F(−) : G-Spc →Shv(BGpro´et).
(2) The functor F(−) is limit-preserving and faithful.
(3) F(−) admits left adjoint L.
(4) F(−) is fully faithful on G-Spccg.
(5) The essential image of G-Spccg generates Shv(BGpro´et) under colimits.
Proof. The argument of Lemma 4.2.12 shows that any continuous surjection of proﬁnite sets is a quotient
map, which gives the sheaf property required in (1). It is clear that the resulting functor F(−) is limit-
preserving. For any X ∈G-Spc, one has FX(G) = X where G ∈BGpro´et is the group itself, viewed as a
left G-set via translation; this immediately gives (2). The adjoint functor theorem gives the existence of L
as in (3), but one can also construct it explicitly: the functor hS 7→S extends to a unique colimit preserving
functor Shv(BGpro´et) →G-Spc by the universal property of the presheaf category (as a free cocompletion
of BGpro´et) and the fact that covers in BGpro´et give quotient maps. In particular, if F ∈Shv(BGpro´et),
then F = colimIF hS, where IF is the category of pairs (S, s) with S ∈BGpro´et and s ∈F(S), which
gives L(F) = colimIF S. For (4), it is enough to show that L(FX) ≃X for any compactly generated X.
By the previous construction, one has L(FX) = colimIFX S, so we must check that there exists a set I of
spaces Si ∈BGpro´et and G-maps si : Si →X such that ⊔iSi →X is a quotient map. Choose a set I of
compact Hausdorff spaces Ti and a quotient map ⊔iTi →X. Then the map ⊔iTi × G →X induced by
the G-action is also a quotient, so we reduce to the case where X is a compact Hausdorff G-space. Now
consider Y := G × β(X) ∈BGpro´et, where the G-action is deﬁned via g · (h, η) = (gh, η). There is an
induced continuous map f : Y →X via G × β(X) →G × X →X, where the last map is the action.
One checks that f is G-equivariant and surjective. As Y is proﬁnite, this proves (4). Lastly, (5) is formal as
FS = hS for S ∈BGpro´et.
□
Let G-Mod denote the category of continuous G-modules, i.e., topological abelian groups equipped with
a continuous G-action, and let G-Modcg ⊂G-Mod be the full subcategory of topological G-modules
whose underlying space is compactly generated. The functor F(−) restricts to a functor F(−) : G-Mod →
Ab(BGpro´et), and Lemma 4.3.2 (1) - (4) apply formally to this functor as well. The main non-formal
statement is:
31

Proposition 4.3.3. With notation as above, one has:
(1) The essential image of F(−) : G-Modcg →Ab(BGpro´et) generates the target under colimits.
(2) Every N ∈Ab(BGpro´et) has a resolution whose terms come from G-Modcg.
To prove Proposition 4.3.3, we review some topological group theory. For a topological space X, write
AX for the free topological abelian group on X, deﬁned by the obvious universal property. One may show
that AX is abstractly isomorphic to the free abelian group on the set X, see [AT08, Theorem 7.1.7]. In
particular, one has a reduced length associated to each f ∈AX, deﬁned as the sum of the absolute values of
the coefﬁcients. Let A≤NX ⊂AX be the subset of words of length ≤N; one checks that this is a closed
subspace, see [AT08, Theorem 7.1.13]. Moreover:
Theorem 4.3.4 (Graev). If X is a compact topological space, then AX = colim A≤NX as spaces.
Proof. See Theorem [AT08, Theorem 7.4.1].
□
We use this to prove.
Lemma 4.3.5. Fix a compact Hausdorff space S, an extremally disconnected proﬁnite set T, and a contin-
uous map f : T →AS. Then there exists a clopen decomposition T = ⊔iTi such that f|Ti is a Z-linear
combination of continuous maps Ti →S.
Proof. Lemma 4.3.7 and Theorem 4.3.4 imply that f factors through some A≤NS. Now consider the
proﬁnite set eS = S ⊔{0} ⊔S and the induced map φ : eSN →A≤N deﬁned by viewing eS as the subspace

1 · S

⊔{0} ⊔

−1 · S

⊂AS and using the group law. This map is continuous and surjective, and all
spaces in sight are compact Hausdorff. By extremal disconnectedness, there is a lift T →eSN; one checks
that this implies the desired claim.
□
We can now identify the free abelian sheaf ZhS for any S ∈BGpro´et:
Lemma 4.3.6. If S ∈BGpro´et, then ZhS ≃FAS.
Proof. One clearly has FS = hS, so there is a natural map ψ : ZhS →FAS of abelian sheaves induced by
FS →FAS. We will check ψ(T) is an isomorphism for T covering BGpro´et. Let F : ∗pro´et →BGpro´et
be a left adjoint to the forgetful functor BGpro´et →∗pro´et. Then it is enough to check ψ(F(T)) is an
isomorphism for T extremally disconnected. Unwinding deﬁnitions, this is exactly Lemma 4.3.5.
□
Proposition 4.3.3 falls out quickly:
Proof of Proposition 4.3.3. Theorem 4.3.4 shows that AS is compactly generated for any S ∈BGpro´et.
Now Lemma 4.3.6 gives (1) as the collection {ZhS} generates Ab(BGpro´et) under colimits. Finally, (2) is
formal from (1).
□
The next lemma was used above, and will be useful later.
Lemma 4.3.7. Fix a countable tower X1 ⊂X2 ⊂· · · ⊂Xn ⊂. . . of closed immersions of Hausdorff
topological spaces, and let X = colimi Xi. Then Mapcont(S, X) = colim Mapcont(S, Xi).
Proof. We must show each f : S →X factors through some Xi. Towards contradiction, assume there
exists a map f : S →X with f(S) ̸⊂Xi for all i. After reindexing, we may assume that there exist xi ∈S
such that f(xi) ∈Xi −Xi−1. These points give a map π : βN →S via i 7→xi. After replacing f with
f ◦π, we may assume S = βN; set T = {f(i)|i ∈N}. Now pick any x ∈X −T. Then x ∈Xj for some
j. For i > j, we may inductively construct open neighourhoods x ∈Ui ⊂Xi such that Ui ∩T = ∅, and
Ui+1 ∩Xi = Ui; here we use that Xi ∩T is ﬁnite. The union U = ∪iUi ⊂X is an open neighbourhood
of x ∈X that misses T. Hence, f −1(U) ∩N = ∅, so f −1(U) = ∅by density of N ⊂S. Varying over all
x ∈X −T then shows that f(S) = T. Now one checks that T ⊂X is discrete: any open neighbourhood
1 ∈U1 ⊂X1 can be inductively extended to open neighbourhoods x1 ∈Ui ⊂Xi such that Ui+1 ∩Xi = Ui
and xi /∈Ui. Then T must be ﬁnite as S is compact, which is a contradiction.
□
We now study the cohomology theory M 7→RΓ(BGpro´et, FM) on G-Mod. There is a natural transfor-
mation connecting it to continuous cohomology:
32

Lemma 4.3.8. For any M ∈G-Mod, there is a natural map ΦM : RΓcont(G, M) →RΓ(BGpro´et, FM).
Proof. By [Sch13, Proposition 3.7], one has RΓcont(G, M) = RΓ(BG′
pro´et, µ∗FM), where BG′
pro´et is
deﬁned as in Remark 4.1.11, and µ : Shv(BGpro´et) →Shv(BG′
pro´et) the natural map; one then deﬁnes
φM via pullback as µ∗µ∗≃id on D(BGpro´et) (simply because BGpro´et is ﬁner topology than BG′
pro´et on
the same category).
□
The map ΦM is an isomorphism for a fairly large collection of modules:
Lemma 4.3.9. Let C ⊂G-Mod be the full subcategory of all M ∈G-Mod for which Riµ∗FM = 0 for all
i > 0, where µ : Shv(BGpro´et) →Shv(BG′
pro´et) is the natural map.
(1) For all M ∈C, the map ΦM : RΓcont(G, M) →RΓ(BGpro´et, FM) is an isomorphism.
(2) If M ∈G-Mod is discrete, then M ∈C.
(3) If M = colim Mi is a sequential colimit of Hausdorff Mi ∈C along closed immersions, then
M ∈C.
(4) If M = lim Mi is a sequential limit of Mi ∈C along proﬁnitely split Mi+1 →Mi, then M ∈C.
(5) If M = lim Mi is a sequential limit of Mi ∈C along β-epimorphisms Mi+1 →Mi with kernel
Ki = ker(Mi+1 →Mi) ∈C, then M ∈C.
Here a quotient map M →N of topological spaces is said to be proﬁnitely split if it admits sections
over any map K →N with K proﬁnite. It is said to be a β-epimorphism if for every map g : K →N
with K compact Hausdorff, there is a surjection K′ →K with K′ compact Hausdorff, and a lift K′ →M;
equivalently, for any map β(X) →N where X is discrete, there is a lift β(X) →M. This property is
automatic if M →N is a quotient map, and the kernel is compact Hausdorff.
Proof. Parts (1) and (2) are clear. For (3), note that FM = colim FMi by Lemma 4.3.7, so the result follows
as Rµ∗commutes with ﬁltered colimits. For parts (4) and (5), note that if Mi+1 →Mi is a β-epimorphism,
then FMi+1 →FMi is surjective on BGpro´et. By repleteness, we get FM = lim FMi = R lim FMi.
Applying Rµ∗and using repleteness of BG′
pro´et, we have to show that R1 lim(µ∗FMi) = 0. If all Mi+1 →
Mi are proﬁnitely split, then all µ∗FMi+1 →µ∗FMi are surjective, so the result follows from repleteness of
BG′
pro´et. If Ki = ker(Mi+1 →Mi) ∈C, then on applying Rµ∗to the sequence
0 →FKi →FMi+1 →FMi →0,
we ﬁnd that µ∗FMi+1 →µ∗FMi is surjective, so again the result follows from repleteness of BG′
pro´et.
□
Remark 4.3.10. The category C of Lemma 4.3.9 includes many standard Galois modules occurring in
arithmetic geometry obtained by iterations of completions and localisations applied to discrete modules.
For example, when G = Gal(Qp/Qp), the G-module BdR is such an object.
We now indicate one respect in which RΓ(BGpro´et, F(−)) behaves better than continuous cohomology:
one gets long exact sequences in cohomology with fewer constraints.
Lemma 4.3.11. Fix an algebraically short exact sequence 0 →M′
a→M
b→M′′ →0 in G-Mod. Assume
b is a β-epimorphism, and a realises M′ as a subspace of M. Then there is an induced long exact sequence
on applying H∗(BGpro´et, F(−)).
Proof. It is enough to show that
0 →FM′ →FM →FM′′ →0
is exact. Exactness on the right results from the assumption on b, exactness on the left is obvious from the
injectivity of M′ ֒→M, and exactness in the middle comes from the assumption on a.
□
Remark 4.3.12. Considerations of the discrete topology show that some hypothesis must be imposed in
Lemma 4.3.11. The assumption used above is fairly weak: it is automatic if M′ is compact Hausdorff. In
contrast, in continuous cohomology, one demands existence of sections after base change to all proﬁnite
sets over M′′.

5. RELATIONS WITH THE ´ETALE TOPOLOGY
Fix a scheme X. Since an ´etale map is also a weakly ´etale map, we obtain a morphism of topoi
ν : Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(X´et).
The main goal of this section is to describe its behaviour at the level of derived categories. The pullback and
pushforward along ν, together with the resulting semiorthogonal decompositions of complexes on Xpro´et,
are discussed in §5.1 and §5.2. This is used to describe the left-completion of D(X´et) in terms of D(Xpro´et)
in §5.3. Some elementary remarks on the functoriality of ν in X are recorded in §5.4. Finally, we describe
Ekedahl’s category of “adic” complexes [Eke90] in terms of D(Xpro´et) in §5.5. We rigorously adhere to the
derived convention: the functors ν∗and ν∗, when applied to complexes, are understood to be derived.
5.1. The pullback. We begin with the pullback at the level of sheaves of sets:
Lemma 5.1.1. For F ∈Shv(X´et) and U ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et with a presentation U = limi Ui, one has ν∗F(U) =
colimi F(Ui).
Proof. The problem is local on X, so we may assume that X = Spec(A) is afﬁne. In that case, by Remark
4.2.5, the site Xpro´et is equivalent to the site S given by ind-´etale A-algebras B = colim Bi, with covers
given by faithfully ﬂat maps. The pullback F ′ of F to S as a presheaf is given by F ′(B) = colim F(Bi). It
thus sufﬁces to check that F ′ is a sheaf; we will do this using Lemma 4.2.6. First, note that F ′ is a Zariski
sheaf since any ﬁnite collection of quasicompact open subschemes of SpecB come via pullback from some
SpecBi. It remains to show that F ′ satisﬁes the sheaf axiom for every faithfully ﬂat ind-´etale map B →C
of ind-´etale A-algebras. If B →C is actually ´etale, then it arises via base change from some faithfully
ﬂat ´etale map Bi →Ci, so the claim follows as F is a sheaf. In general, write C = colim Cj as a ﬁltered
colimit of ´etale B-algebras Cj, necessarily faithfully ﬂat. Then F ′(C) = colimj F ′(Cj). The sheaf axiom
for B →C now follows by taking ﬁltered colimits.
□
A ﬁrst consequence of the above formula is that ν∗is fully faithful. In fact, we have:
Lemma 5.1.2. The pullback ν∗: Shv(X´et) →Shv(Xpro´et) is fully faithful. Its essential image consists
exactly of those sheaves F with F(U) = colimi F(Ui) for any U ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et with presentation U = limi Ui.
Proof. Lemma 5.1.1 shows that F ≃ν∗ν∗F for any F ∈Shv(X´et), which formally implies that ν∗is
fully faithful. For the second part, ﬁx some G ∈Shv(Xpro´et) satisfying the condition of the lemma. Then
Lemma 5.1.1 (together with Lemma 4.2.4) shows that ν∗ν∗G →G is an isomorphism, which proves the

Deﬁnition 5.1.3. A sheaf F ∈Shv(Xpro´et) is called classical if it lies in the essential image of ν∗:
Shv(X´et) →Shv(Xpro´et).
In particular, F is classical if and only if ν∗ν∗F →F is an isomorphism. We need a simple lemma on
recognizing classical sheaves.
Lemma 5.1.4. Let F be a sheaf on Xpro´et. Assume that for some pro-´etale cover {Yi →X}, F|Yi is
classical. Then F is classical.
Proof. We may assume that X = SpecA is afﬁne, that there is only one Y = Yi = SpecB, with A →B ind-
´etale, B = colimi Bi, with A →Bi ´etale. We need to check that for any ind-´etale A-algebra C = colimj Cj,
we have F(C) = colimj F(Cj). Now consider the following diagram, expressing the sheaf property for
C →B ⊗C, resp. Cj →B ⊗Cj.

// colimj F(Cj ⊗B ⊗B)
The second and third vertical arrows are isomorphisms as F|SpecB is classical. Thus, the ﬁrst vertical arrow
is an isomorphism as well, as desired.

As an example, let us show how this implies that the category of local systems does not change under
passage from X´et to Xpro´et.
Corollary 5.1.5. Let R be a discrete ring.
Let LocX´et(R) be the category of R-modules L´et on X´et
which are locally free of ﬁnite rank. Similarly, let LocXpro´et(R) be the category of R-modules Lpro´et on
Xpro´et which are locally free of ﬁnite rank. Then ν∗deﬁnes an equivalence of categories LocX´et(R) ∼=
LocXpro´et(R).
In the following, we denote either category by LocX(R).
Proof. If L´et ∈LocX´et(R), then clearly Lpro´et = ν∗L´et ∈LocXpro´et(R); as ν∗is fully faithful, it remains
to verify essential surjectivity. Thus, take Lpro´et ∈LocXpro´et(R). As Lpro´et is locally free of ﬁnite rank, it
is in particular locally classical, thus classical by Lemma 5.1.4. Thus, Lpro´et = ν∗L´et for some sheaf L´et of
R-modules on X´et. Assume that U ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et with presentation U = lim Ui is such that Lpro´et|U ∼= Rn|U.
The isomorphism is given by n elements of (Lpro´et)(U) = colimi L´et(Ui). This shows that the isomorphism
Lpro´et|U ∼= Rn|U is already deﬁned over some Ui, thus L´et ∈LocX´et(R), as desired.
□
Next, we pass to derived categories.
Corollary 5.1.6. For any K ∈D+(X´et), the adjunction map K →ν∗ν∗K is an equivalence. Moreover, if
U ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et with presentation U = limi Ui, then RΓ(U, ν∗K) = colimi RΓ(Ui, K).
Proof. The ﬁrst part follows from the second part by checking it on sections using Lemma 4.2.4, i.e., by
applying RΓ(V, −) to the map K →ν∗ν∗K for each afﬁne V ∈X´et. For the second part, the collection
of all K ∈D+(X´et) for which the claim is true forms a triangulated category stable under ﬁltered colimits.
Hence, it sufﬁces to prove the claim for K ∈Ab(X´et) ⊂D+(X´et). For such K, since we already know the
result on H0 by Lemma 5.1.1, it sufﬁces to prove: Hp(U, ν∗I) = 0 for I ∈Ab(X´et) injective, p > 0, and
U ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et. By [SGA72b, Proposition V.4.3], it sufﬁces to prove that ˇHp(U, ν∗I) = 0 for the same data.
Choose a presentation U = limi Ui for some coﬁltered category I. By Theorem 2.3.4, a coﬁnal collection of
covers of U in Xpro´et is obtained by taking coﬁltered limits of afﬁne ´etale covers obtained via base change
from some Ui. Using Lemma 5.1.1 again, we can write
ˇHp(U, F) = colim Hp
I(V )
// I(V ×Ui V )
/// I(V ×Ui V ×Ui V )
////· · ·

where the colimit is computed over (the opposite of) the category of pairs (i, V ) where i ∈I, and V →Ui is
an afﬁne ´etale cover. For a ﬁxed i, the corresponding colimit has vanishing higher cohomology since I|Ui is
injective in Ab(Ui,´et), and hence has trivial higher Cech cohomology. The claim follows as ﬁltered colimits
are exact.
□
Again, we will refer to objects in the essential image of ν∗as classical, and Lemma 5.1.4 extends to
bounded-below derived categories with the same proof.
Remark 5.1.7. The argument used to prove Corollary 5.1.6 also shows: if U ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et is w-strictly local,
then Hp(U, ν∗F) = 0 for all F ∈Ab(X´et) and p > 0. Indeed, for such U, any afﬁne ´etale cover V →U
has a section, so the corresponding Cech nerve is homotopy-equivalent to U as a simplicial scheme.
Remark 5.1.8. If K ∈D(X´et) is an unbounded complex, then the formula in Corollary 5.1.6 is not true.
Instead, to describe ν∗K, ﬁrst observe that ν∗K ≃R lim ν∗τ ≥−nK as Shv(Xpro´et) is replete and ν∗
commutes with Postnikov truncations. Hence, RΓ(Y, ν∗K) ≃R lim colimi RΓ(Yi, τ ≥−nK) for any Y ∈
Xaﬀ
pro´et with a presentation Y = lim Yi. Moreover, since ν∗commutes with arbitrary limits, we also see that
ν∗ν∗K ≃R lim τ ≥−nK. For an explicit example, we remark that Example 3.3.4 can be adapted to exhibit
the failure of id →ν∗ν∗being an equivalence.
An abelian consequence is:
Corollary 5.1.9. The pullback ν∗: Ab(X´et) →Ab(Xpro´et) induces an equivalence on Exti for all i. In
particular, ν∗(Ab(X´et)) ⊂Ab(Xpro´et) is a Serre subcategory.
35

Proof. Let C ⊂Ab(X´et) be the full subcategory of sheaves F for which Exti(F, −) ≃Exti(ν∗(F), ν∗(−))
for all i. Then C contains all direct sums of sheaves of the form ZU for U ∈X´et by Corollary 5.1.6. Since
any F ∈Ab(X´et) admits a surjection from such a direct sum, the claim follows by dimension shifting.
□
5.2. The pushforward. Our goal is to describe the pushforward ν∗: D(Xpro´et) →D(X´et) and the result-
ing decomposition of D(Xpro´et). To do so, it is convenient to isolate the kernel of ν∗:
Deﬁnition 5.2.1. A complex L ∈D(Xpro´et) is parasitic if RΓ(ν−1U, L) = 0 for any U ∈X´et. Write
Dp(Xpro´et) ⊂D(Xpro´et) for the full subcategory of parasitic complexes, D+
p (Xpro´et) for bounded below
parasitics, etc.
The key example is:
Example 5.2.2. Let {Fn} ∈Fun(Nop, Ab(X´et)) be a projective system of sheaves with surjective transi-
tion maps. Set K = R lim Fn ∈D(X´et), and K′ = R lim ν∗(Fn) ∈D(Xpro´et). Then K′ ≃lim ν∗(Fn)
as Xpro´et is replete. The natural map ν∗K →K′ has a parasitic cone since ν∗ν∗K ≃K = R lim Fn ≃
R lim ν∗ν∗Fn ≃ν∗K′. For example, when X = Spec(Q), the cone of the map ν∗(R lim µn) →lim µn is
non-zero and parasitic.
The basic structural properties of Dp(Xpro´et) are:
Lemma 5.2.3. The following are true:
(1) Dp(Xpro´et) is the kernel of ν∗: D(Xpro´et) →D(X´et).
(2) Dp(Xpro´et) is a thick triangulated subcategory of D(Xpro´et).
(3) The inclusion i : Dp(Xpro´et) →D(Xpro´et) has a left adjoint L.
(4) The adjunction L ◦i →id is an equivalence.
Proof. Sketches:
(1) This follows from the adjunction between ν∗and ν∗together with the fact that D(X´et) is generated
under homotopy-colimits by sheaves of the form ZU for U ∈X´et.
(2) Clear.
(3) Consider the functor M : D(Xpro´et) →D(Xpro´et) deﬁned via M(K) = cok(ν∗ν∗K →K).
There is a map id →M, and hence a tower id →M →M2 →M3 →. . . , where Mn is the
n-fold composition of M with itself. We set L : D(Xpro´et) →D(Xpro´et) to be the (ﬁltered) colimit
of this tower, i.e., L(K) = M∞(K) := colimn Mn(K). We will show that L(K) is parasitic for
any K, and that the induced functor L : D(Xpro´et) →Dp(Xpro´et) is a left adjoint to i. Choose any
U ∈X´et. As U is qcqs, we have
RΓ(ν−1U, L(K)) ≃RΓ(ν−1U, colim
n
Mn(K)) = colim
n
RΓ(ν−1U, Mn(K)).
Hence, to show that L takes on parasitic values, it sufﬁces to show that
RΓ(ν−1U, K) →RΓ(ν−1U, M(K))
is the 0 map for any K ∈D(Xpro´et). Since ν is a map of a topoi, we have a factorisation
RΓ(ν−1U, K) ≃RΓ(U, ν∗K) ν−1
→RΓ(ν−1U, ν∗ν∗K) →RΓ(ν−1U, K)
of the identity map on RΓ(ν−1U, K). The composition RΓ(ν−1U, K) →RΓ(ν−1U, M(K)) is
then 0 by deﬁnition of M(K), which proves that L(K) is parasitic. To show that the induced
functor L : D(Xpro´et) →Dp(Xpro´et) is a left adjoint to the inclusion, note ﬁrst that for any
K, P ∈D(Xpro´et) with P parasitic, one has Hom(ν∗ν∗K, P) = Hom(ν∗K, ν∗P) = 0 by (1). The
exact triangle deﬁning M(K) shows
Hom(K, P) ≃Hom(M(K), P) ≃Hom(M2(K), P) ≃· · · ≃Hom(Mn(K), P)
for any n ≥0. Taking limits then shows
Hom(K, P) = lim Hom(Mn(K), P) = Hom(colim
n
Mn(K), P) = Hom(L(K), P),
which is the desired adjointness.
36

(4) This follows from (1) and the construction of L given in (3): for any parasitic P ∈D(Xpro´et), one
has P ≃M(P) ≃Mn(P) ≃colimn Mn(P) ≃L(P) since ν∗P = 0.
□
Remark 5.2.4. In Lemma 5.2.3, it is important to work at the derived level: the full subcategory Abp(Xpro´et)
of all F ∈Ab(Xpro´et) with F(ν−1U) = 0 for any U ∈X´et is not a Serre subcategory of Ab(Xpro´et). For
example, let X = Spec(Q) and set bZℓ(1) := lim µℓn ∈Ab(Xpro´et). Then there is an exact sequence
1 →bZℓ(1)
ℓ→bZℓ(1) →µℓ→1
in Ab(Xpro´et). One easily checks that bZℓ(1) ∈Abp(Xpro´et), while µℓ̸∈Abp(Xpro´et).
Remark 5.2.5. The localisation functor L : D(Xpro´et) →Dp(Xpro´et) from Lemma 5.2.3 admits a partic-
ularly simple description when restricted to bounded below complexes: L(K) ≃cok(ν∗ν∗K →K) for
any K ∈D+(Xpro´et). Indeed, by the proof of Lemma 5.2.3 (3), it sufﬁces to show that M(K) ≃M2(K)
for such a complex K; this follows from the formula ν∗ν∗ν∗ν∗K ≃ν∗ν∗K, which comes from Corollary
5.1.6.
We can now show that D+(X´et) and D+
p (Xpro´et) give a semiorthogonal decomposition for D+(Xpro´et).
Proposition 5.2.6. Consider the adjoints D+(Xpro´et)
ν∗
/ D+(X´et)
ν∗
o
and D+
p (Xpro´et)
i
/ D+(Xpro´et)
L
o
.
(1) ν∗is fully faithful.
(2) The adjunction id →ν∗ν∗is an equivalence.
(3) The essential image of ν∗is exactly those K ∈D+(Xpro´et) whose cohomology sheaves are in
ν∗(Ab(X´et)).
(4) The pushforward ν∗realises D+(X´et) as the Verdier quotient of D+(Xpro´et) by D+
p (Xpro´et).
(5) The map L realises D+
p (Xpro´et) as the Verdier quotient of D+(Xpro´et) by ν∗(D+(X´et)).
Proof. Sketches:
(1) This follows formally from Corollary 5.1.6.
(2) This follows from (1) by Yoneda.
(3) Let C ⊂D+(Xpro´et) be the full subcategory of complexes whose cohomology sheaves lie in
ν∗(Ab(X´et)); by Corollary 5.1.9, this is a triangulated subcategory of D+(Xpro´et) closed under
ﬁltered colimits. Moreover, chasing triangles and truncations characterises C as the smallest tri-
angulated subcategory of D+(Xpro´et) closed under ﬁltered colimits that contains ν∗(Ab(X´et)).
Now ν∗(D+(X´et)) ⊂C as ν∗is exact. Moreover, by (1) and left-adjointness of ν∗, we see that
ν∗(D+(X´et)) is a triangulated subcategory of D+(Xpro´et) closed under ﬁltered colimits. Since
ν∗(D+(X´et)) clearly contains ν∗(Ab(X´et)), the claim follows.
(4) By Lemma 5.2.7, we want ν∗to admit a fully faithful left adjoint; this is what (1) says.
(5) This follows from Lemma 5.2.3 and Lemma 5.2.7 provided ν∗(D+(X´et)) is the kernel of L. By
Remark 5.2.5, the kernel of L is exactly those K with ν∗ν∗K ≃K, so the claim follows using
Corollary 5.1.6.
□
The following observation was used above:
Lemma 5.2.7. Let L : C1 →C2 be a triangulated functor between triangulated categories. If L admits a
fully faithful left or right adjoint i, then L is a Verdier quotient of C1 by ker(L).
Proof. By symmetry, we may assume L is a left adjoint. Given a triangulated functor F : C1 →D which
carries ker(L) to 0, we will show that the natural map F →F ◦i ◦L is an equivalence. First, adjunction
shows L ◦i ≃id via the natural map as i is fully faithful. Hence, for each K ∈C1, we get a triangle
K′ →K →(i ◦L)(K) such that L(K′) = 0. This shows that F(K) ≃(F ◦i ◦L)(K) for all such F,
proving the claim.
□
Remark 5.2.8. If we assume that X´et is locally of ﬁnite cohomological dimension, then D(X´et) is left-
complete. Since D(Xpro´et) is also left-complete, one can show that ν∗: D(X´et) →D(Xpro´et) is fully
faithful by reduction to the bounded below case. In fact, every statement in Proposition 5.2.6 extends to the
unbounded setting in this case.
37

At the unbounded level, the pullback ν∗: D(X´et) →D(Xpro´et) is not fully faithful in general, as
explained in Remark 5.1.8, so none of the arguments in Proposition 5.2.6 apply. Nevertheless, we can still
prove a semiorthogonal decomposition as in Proposition 5.2.6 at the expense of replacing D(X´et) with the
smallest triangulated subcategory D′ ⊂D(Xpro´et) that contains ν∗(D(X´et)) and is closed under ﬁltered
colimits:
Proposition 5.2.9. Let D′ ⊂D(Xpro´et) be as above. Then
(1) If ν∗is fully faithful, then ν∗induces an equivalence D(X´et) ≃D′.
(2) Given K ∈D(Xpro´et), one has K ∈D′ if and only if Hom(K, K′) = 0 for any K′ ∈Dp(Xpro´et).
(3) The inclusion i : D′ ֒→D admits a right adjoint N : D(Xpro´et) →D′ such that N ◦i ≃id.
(4) The localisation L realises Dp(Xpro´et) as the Verdier quotient of D(Xpro´et) by D′.
(5) The map N realises D′ as the Verdier quotient of D(Xpro´et) by Dp(Xpro´et).
Proof. Sketches:
(1) If ν∗is fully faithful, then K ≃ν∗ν∗K ≃R lim τ ≥−nK (where the last isomorphism is from
Remark 5.1.8). The claim now follows by reduction to the bounded case, as in Remark 5.2.8.
(2) Since ν∗(D(X´et)) is left-orthogonal to Dp(Xpro´et), so is D′. For the converse direction, con-
sider the functors Ni : D(Xpro´et) →D(Xpro´et) deﬁned via Ni(K) = ker(K →Mi(K)) where
M(K) = cok(ν∗ν∗K →K) (as in the proof of Lemma 5.2.3). The tower id →M →M2 →
M3 →. . . gives rise to a tower N1 →N2 →N3 →· · · →id with Ni+1 being an extension of
ν∗ν∗Mi by Ni; set N = colimi Ni. The description in terms of extensions shows Ni(K) ∈D′ for
all i, and hence N ∈D′ as D′ is closed under ﬁltered colimits. Moreover, setting L = colimi Mi
gives an exact triangle N →id →L of functors. As in Lemma 5.2.3, L realises the parasitic
localisation D(Xpro´et) →Dp(Xpro´et). Hence, if Hom(K, K′) = 0 for every parasitic K′, then
K ≃N(K) ∈D′ by the previous triangle.
(3) One checks that the functor N : D(Xpro´et) →D′ constructed in (2) does the job (using the exact
triangle N →id →L and the fact that Hom(D′, L(K)) = 0 for all K by (2)).
(4) This follows from Lemma 5.2.7 if we could show that D′ is the kernel of L. For this, one simply
uses the exact triangle N →id →L as in (2).
(5) This is proven exactly like (4).
□
5.3. Realising the left-completion of D(X´et) via the pro-´etale site. Our goal is to identify the left-
completion bD(X´et) with a certain subcategory of D(Xpro´et) using the analysis of the previous sections. The
starting point is the following observation: by Proposition 3.3.3, the pullback ν∗: D(X´et) →D(Xpro´et)
factors through τ : D(X´et) →bD(X´et). To go further, we isolate a subcategory of D(Xpro´et) that contains
the image of ν∗:
Deﬁnition 5.3.1. Let Dcc(Xpro´et) be the full subcategory of D(Xpro´et) spanned by complexes whose coho-
mology sheaves lie in ν∗(Ab(X´et)); we write D+
cc(Xpro´et) for the bounded below objects, etc.
Since ν∗: D(X´et) →D(Xpro´et) is exact, it factors through Dcc(Xpro´et), and hence we get a functor
bD(X´et) →Dcc(Xpro´et). Our main observation is that this functor is an equivalence. More precisely:
Proposition 5.3.2. There is an adjunction Dcc(Xpro´et) νcc,∗
/ D(X´et)
ν∗
cc
o
induced by ν∗and ν∗. This adjunc-
tion is isomorphic to the left-completion adjunction bD(X´et)
R lim
/ D(X´et)
τ
o
. In particular, Dcc(Xpro´et) ≃
bD(X´et).
Proof. The existence of the adjunction is formal from the following: (a) ν∗carries D(X´et) to Dcc(Xpro´et),
and (b) Dcc(Xpro´et) ֒→D(Xpro´et) is fully faithful. Proposition 5.2.6 immediately implies that ν∗
cc in-
duces an equivalence D+(X´et) ≃D+
cc(Xpro´et). To extend to the unbounded setting, observe that K ∈
Dcc(Xpro´et) if and only if τ ≥−nK ∈Dcc(Xpro´et) by the left-completeness of D(Xpro´et) and the exact-
ness of ν∗. This lets us deﬁne functors µ : bD(X´et) →Dcc(Xpro´et) and γ : Dcc(Xpro´et) →bD(X´et)
via µ({Kn}) = R lim ν∗(Kn) and γ(K) = {ν∗τ ≥−nK}; one can check that µ and γ realise the desired
mutually inverse equivalences.
□
38

Since D′ is the smallest subcategory of D(Xpro´et) that contains ν∗D(X´et) and is closed under ﬁltered
colimits, one has D′ ⊂Dcc(Xpro´et). It is natural to ask how close this functor is to being an equivalence.
One can show that if D(X´et) is left-complete, then D(X´et) ≃D′ ≃Dcc(Xpro´et); we expect that D′ ≃
Dcc(Xpro´et) fails without left-completeness, but do not have an example.
5.4. Functoriality. We study the variation of ν : Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(X´et) with X. For notational clarity,
we often write νX instead of ν.
Lemma 5.4.1. A morphism f : X →Y of schemes induces a map fpro´et : Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(Ypro´et) of
topoi with f ∗given by pullback on representable objects. The induced diagram
Shv(Xpro´et)
fpro´et

νX
/ Shv(X´et)
f´et

Shv(Ypro´et)
νY
/ Shv(Y´et)
commutes. In particular, for F either in Shv(Y´et) or D(Y´et), there is an isomorphism f ∗
pro´et ◦ν∗
Y (F) ≃
ν∗
X ◦f ∗
´et(F).
Proof. Since all maps in sight are induced by morphisms of sites, this follows simply by the deﬁnition of
pullback.
□
Lemma 5.4.2. Let f : X →Y be a universal homeomorphism of schemes, i.e., f is universally bijective
and integral. Then f∗: Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(Ypro´et) is an equivalence.
Proof. The claim is local on Y , so we may Y and X are afﬁne. By Theorem 2.3.4, we can identify
Shv(Ypro´et) with the topos of sheaves on the site opposite to the category of ind-´etale O(Y )-algebras with
covers generated by faithfully ﬂat maps and Zariski covers, and likewise for X. Since f −1 identiﬁes X´et
with Y´et while preserving afﬁne objects (by integrality) and covers, the claim follows from the topological
invariance of the usual ´etale site.
□
Lemma 5.4.3. Fix a qcqs map f : Y →X of schemes and F either in Shv(Y´et) or D+(Y´et). Then the
natural map
ν∗
Y ◦f´et,∗(F) →fpro´et,∗◦ν∗
X(F)
is an equivalence.
Proof. We ﬁrst handle F ∈Shv(Y´et). The claim is local on X, so we may assume X is afﬁne. First,
consider the case where Y is also afﬁne. Choose some U ∈Y aﬀ
pro´et with presentation U = limi Ui. Then
Lemma 5.1.1 shows
ν∗
Y ◦f´et,∗(F)(U) = colim
i
F(f −1Ui).
As f −1U ∈Y aﬀ
pro´et with presentation f −1U = limi f −1Ui, one concludes by reapplying Lemma 5.1.1. For
not necessarily afﬁne but separated and quasicompact Y , the same argument shows that the claim is true for
all F ∈Shv(Y´et) obtained as pushforwards from an afﬁne open of Y . Since the collection of all F satisfying
the above conclusion is stable under ﬁnite limits, a Mayer-Vietoris argument shows that the claim is true
for all F ∈Shv(Y ) with Y quasicompact and separated. Repeating the argument (and using the separated
case) then gives the claim for all qcqs Y . For F ∈D+(X´et), the same argument applies using Corollary
5.1.6 instead of Lemma 5.1.1 (with ﬁnite limits replaced by ﬁnite homotopy-limits).
□
Remark 5.4.4. Lemma 5.4.3 does not apply to unbounded complexes. Any scheme X′ with D(X′
´et) not
left-complete (see Remark 3.3.5) gives a counterexample as follows. Choose K ∈D(X′
´et) for which
K ̸≃R lim τ ≥−nK.
Then there is an X ∈X′
´et for which RΓ(X, K) ̸≃RΓ(X, R lim τ ≥−nK) ≃
RΓ(Xpro´et, ν∗K) (here we use Remark 5.1.8). The map X →Spec(Z) with F = K|X gives the de-
sired counterexample.
Remark 5.4.5. One reason to prefer the pro-´etale topology to the fpqc topology is that the analogue of
Lemma 5.4.3 fails for the latter: ´etale pushforwards do not commute with arbitrary base change.
39

Lemma 5.4.3 and the repleteness of the pro-´etale topology let us access pushforwards of unbounded
complexes quite easily; as pointed out by Brian Conrad, a similar statement can also be shown for D(X´et)
using Hartshorne’s formalism of “way-out” functors.
Lemma 5.4.6. Let f : X →Y be a map of qcqs schemes. Assume f∗: Mod(X´et, F) →Mod(Y´et, F) has
cohomological dimension ≤d for a ring F. Then f∗: D(Xpro´et, F) →D(Ypro´et, F) carries D≤k
cc (Xpro´et, F)
to D≤k+d+1
cc
(Ypro´et, F).
Proof. Fix K ∈D≤k
cc (Xpro´et). Then K ≃R lim τ ≥−nK by repleteness, so f∗K ≃R lim f∗τ ≥−nK.
Lemma 5.4.3 and the assumption on f show f∗τ ≥−nK ∈D≤k+d
cc
(Ypro´et). As R lim has cohomological
dimension ≤1 by repleteness, half of the claim follows. It remains to check that Hi(f∗K) ∈ν∗Ab(Y´et).
For this, observe that, for ﬁxed i, the projective system {Hi(f∗τ ≥−nK)} is essentially constant: for n ≫0,
the map f∗τ ≥−(n+1)K →f∗τ ≥−nK induces an isomorphism on Hi by assumption on f. By repleteness,
this proves Hi(f∗K) ≃Hi(f∗τ ≥−nK) for n ≫0, which is enough by Lemma 5.4.3.
□
5.5. Relation with Ekedahl’s theory. In this section, we ﬁx a noetherian ring R complete for the topology
deﬁned by an ideal m ⊂R. For this data, we follow the notation of §3.4 with X = Shv(Xpro´et). We use
here the following (slight variations on) assumptions introduced by Ekedahl, [Eke90].
Deﬁnition 5.5.1.
(A) There is an integer N and a set of generators Yi, Yi ∈X´et, of X´et, such that for all R/m-modules
M on X´et, Hn(Yi, M) = 0 for n > N.
(B) The ideal m is regular, and the R/m-module mn/mn+1 has ﬁnite ﬂat dimension bounded indepen-
dently of n.
Here, condition (A) agrees with Ekedahl’s condition (A), but condition (B) may be slightly stronger than
Ekedahl’s condition (B). By Proposition 3.3.7 (2), condition (A) ensures that D(X´et, R/m) is left-complete,
as are all D(X´et, R/mn). Ekedahl considers the following category.
Deﬁnition 5.5.2. If condition (A) is fulﬁlled, let ∗= −, if condition (B) is fulﬁlled, let ∗= +, and if condition
(A) and (B) are fulﬁlled, let ∗be empty. Deﬁne D∗
Ek(X, R) as the full subcategory of D∗(XNop
´et
, R•) spanned
by projective systems {Mn} whose transition maps Mn ⊗R/mn R/mn−1 →Mn−1 are isomorphisms for all
n.
In the pro-´etale world, limits behave better, so we can deﬁne the following analogue:
Deﬁnition 5.5.3. Deﬁne DEk(Xpro´et, bR) ⊂Dcomp(Xpro´et, bR) as the full subcategory of complexes K
satisfying K ⊗bR R/m ∈Dcc(Xpro´et), i.e., Hi(K ⊗bR R/m) ∈ν∗Ab(X´et) for all i. If ∗∈{+, −, b}, let
D∗
Ek(Xpro´et, bR) ⊂DEk(Xpro´et, bR) be the full subcategory with corresponding boundedness assumptions.
The main comparison is:
Proposition 5.5.4. If condition (A) is fulﬁlled, let ∗= −, if condition (B) is fulﬁlled, let ∗= +, and
if condition (A) and (B) are fulﬁlled, let ∗be empty. There is a natural equivalence D∗
Ek(Xpro´et, bR) ≃
D∗
Ek(X´et, R).
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that condition (A) is satisﬁed. By Lemma 3.5.7 (iv), we have D−
comp(Xpro´et, bR) ≃
D−
comp(XNop
pro´et, R•). The full subcategory D−
Ek(Xpro´et, bR) consists of those {Kn} ∈D−
comp(XNop
pro´et, R•)
for which Kn ∈D−
cc(Xpro´et, R/mn) for all n, as follows easily by induction on n. Under condition (A),
D(X´et, R/mn) is left-complete, so D−(X´et, R/mn) ∼= D−
cc(Xpro´et, R/mn). This gives the result.
Now assume condition (B). Thus, there exists N ∈N such that if K ∈D≥k
Ek(Xpro´et, bR) for some k,
then K ⊗bR R/mn ∈D≥k−N
cc
(Xpro´et) for all n. Hence, by Lemma 3.5.7, we may view D+
Ek(Xpro´et, bR)
as the full subcategory of D+
comp(XNop
pro´et, R•) spanned by those {Kn} with Kn ∈D+
cc(Xpro´et). Moreover,
by Proposition 5.2.6, ν∗induces an equivalence D+(X´et) ≃D+
cc(Xpro´et). The desired equivalence is then
induced by {Mn} 7→{ν∗Mn} and {Kn} 7→{ν∗Kn}.
If condition (A) and (B) are satisﬁed, simply combine the two arguments.

5.6. Relation with Jannsen’s theory. Fix a scheme X. In [Jan88, §3], one ﬁnds the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 5.6.1. The continuous ´etale cohomology Hi
cont(X´et, {Fn}) of X with coefﬁcients in a pro-system
{Fn} of abelian sheaves on X´et is the value of the i-th derived functor of the functor Ab(X´et)N →Ab given
by {Fn} 7→H0(X´et, lim Fn).
In general, the groups Hi
cont(X´et, {Fn}) and Hi(X´et, lim Fn) are distinct, even for the projective system
{Z/ℓn}; the difference is explained by the derivatives of the inverse limit functor. As inverse limits are
well-behaved in the pro-´etale world, this problem disappears, and we obtain:
Proposition 5.6.2. Let {Fn} is a pro-system of abelian sheaves on X´et with surjective transition maps.
Then there is a canonical identiﬁcation
Hi
cont(X´et, {Fn}) ≃Hi(Xpro´et, lim ν∗Fn).
Proof. Write RΓcont(X´et, {Fn}) := RΓ(X´et, R lim Fn), so Hi(RΓcont(X´et, {Fn})) ≃Hi
cont(X´et, {Fn})
as deﬁned above by the Grothendieck spectral sequence for composition of derived functors. We then have
RΓcont(X´et, {Fn}) ≃R lim RΓ(X´et, Fn) ≃R lim RΓ(Xpro´et, ν∗Fn) ≃RΓ(Xpro´et, R lim ν∗Fn);
here the ﬁrst and last equality use the commutation of RΓ and R lim, while the second equality comes
from the boundedness of Fn ∈D(X´et). The assumption on {Fn} ensures that R lim Fn ≃lim Fn by the
repleteness of Xpro´et, which proves the claim.

6. CONSTRUCTIBLE SHEAVES
This long section studies constructible sheaves, with the ultimate goal of giving a different perspective on
the notion of a Qℓ-sheaf. We begin by studying in §6.1 and §6.2 the basic functoriality of pushforward and
pullback along locally closed immersions; the main novelty here is that pullback along a closed immersion
is limit- and colimit-preserving, contrary to the classical story. Next, we recall the theory of constructible
complexes in the ´etale topology in §6.3. We alert the reader that our deﬁnition of constructibility is more
natural from the derived perspective, but not the usual one: a constructible complex on a geometric point is
the same thing as a perfect complex, see Remark 6.3.2. In particular, the truncation operators τ≥n, τ≤n do
not in general preserve constructibility. As a globalisation of this remark, we detour in §6.4 to prove that
constructible complexes are the same as compact objects under a suitable ﬁniteness constraint; this material
is surely standard, but not easy to ﬁnd in the literature. We then introduce constructible complexes in the
pro-´etale world in §6.5 with coefﬁcients in a complete noetherian local ring (R, m) as those R-complexes
on Xpro´et which are complete (in the sense of §3.4), and classically constructible modulo m. This deﬁnition
is well-suited for comparison with the classical picture, but, as we explain in §6.6, also coincides with the
more intuitive deﬁnition on a noetherian scheme: a constructible complex is simply an R-complex that is
locally constant and perfect along a stratiﬁcation. This perspective leads in §6.8 to a direct construction of
the category of constructible complexes over coefﬁcient rings that do not satisfy the above constraints, like
Zℓand Qℓ. Along the way, we establish that the formalism of the 6 functors “works” in this setting in §6.7.
6.1. Functoriality for closed immersions. Fix a qcqs scheme X, and a qcqs open j : U ֒→X with closed
complement i : Z →X. We use the subscript “0” to indicate passage from X to Z. First, we show
“henselizations” can be realised as pro-´etale maps.
Lemma 6.1.1. Assume X is afﬁne. Then i−1 : Xaﬀ
pro´et →Zaﬀ
pro´et admits a fully faithful left adjoint V 7→eV .
In particular, we have i−1(eV ) ≃V .
Proof. See Deﬁnition 2.2.10 and Lemma 2.2.12.
□
Henselization deﬁnes a limit-preserving functor between sites:
Lemma 6.1.2. Assume X is afﬁne. Then the functor V 7→eV from Lemma 6.1.1 preserves surjections.
Proof. Fix V = Spec(A0) with eV = Spec(A) for a ring A that is henselian along I = ker(A →A0). It
sufﬁces to show that any ´etale map W →eV whose image contains V ⊂eV is surjective. The complement of
the image gives a closed subset of eV that misses V , but such sets are empty as I lies in the Jacobson radical
of A by assumption.
□
Contrary to the ´etale topology, we can realise i∗simply by evaluation in the pro-´etale world:
Lemma 6.1.3. If X is afﬁne, then i∗F(V ) = F(eV ) for any w-contractible V ∈Zaﬀ
pro´et and F ∈Shv(Xpro´et).
Proof. Clearly, i∗F is the sheaﬁﬁcation of V 7→F(eV ) on Zaﬀ
pro´et. On w-contractible objects, sheaﬁﬁcation
is trivial, giving the result.
□
Remark 6.1.4. It follows from the afﬁne analogue of proper base change, [Gab94], [Hub93], that for clas-
sical torsion sheaves F, i∗F(V ) = F(eV ) for all V ∈Zaﬀ
pro´et; in fact, the afﬁne analogue of proper base
change says precisely that
RΓ(V, i∗F) = RΓ(eV , F) .
As i∗is realised by evaluation, it commutes with limits (which fails for X´et, see Example 6.1.6):
Corollary 6.1.5. The pullback i∗: Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(Zpro´et) commutes with all small limits and colimits.
Proof. The claim about colimits is clear by adjunction. For limits, we must show that the natural map
i∗limi Fi →limi i∗Fi is an isomorphism for any small diagram F : I →Shv(Xpro´et). As this is a local
statement, we may assume X is afﬁne. The claim now follows from Lemma 6.1.3 by evaluating either side
on w-contractible objects in Zaﬀ
pro´et.
□
42

The next example illustrates how i∗fails to be limit-preserving on the ´etale site:
Example 6.1.6. Consider X = Spec(k[x]) with k an algebraically closed ﬁeld, and set i : Z ֒→X to be
the closed immersion deﬁned by I = (x). Let R = k[x], and set S to be the strict henselisation of R at
I, so S = colimi Si where the colimit runs over all ´etale neighbourhoods R →Si →k of Z →X. Now
consider the projective system {OX/In} in Shv(X´et). Then i∗(OX/In) = S/ISn, so lim i∗(OX/In) is the
I-adic completion of S. On the other hand, i∗(lim OX/In) = colimi lim Si/In is the colimit of the I-adic
completions of each Si; one can check that this colimit is not I-adically complete.
Remark 6.1.7. Corollary 6.1.5 shows that i∗has a right adjoint i∗as well as a left-adjoint i#. The latter
is described as the unique colimit-preserving functor sending V ∈Zaﬀ
pro´et to eV ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et. Note that i#
is not left-exact in general, so there is no easy formula computing RΓ(V, i∗F) in terms of RΓ(eV , F) for
V ∈Zpro´et (except in the torsion case, as in Remark 6.1.4).
Lemma 6.1.8. The pushforward i∗: Shv(Zpro´et) →Shv(Xpro´et) is exact.
Proof. Fix a surjection F →G in Shv(Zpro´et). We must show i∗F →i∗G is surjective. As the claim is
local, we may work with afﬁnes. Fix Y ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et and g ∈i∗G(Y ) = G(Y0). Then there is a cover W →Y0
in Zpro´et and a section f ∈F(W) lifting g. The map f
W ⊔Y |U →Y is then a cover by Lemma 6.1.1; here
we use that U ⊂X is quasicompact, so Y |U is also quasicompact. One has i∗F(Y |U) = F(∅) = ∗, and
i∗F(f
W) = F(f
W0) = F(W), so f gives a section in i∗F(f
W ⊔Y |U) lifting g.
□
We can now show that i∗and j! behave in the expected way.
Lemma 6.1.9. For any pointed sheaf F ∈Shv(Xpro´et), the adjunction map F →i∗i∗F is surjective.
Proof. Since the statement is local, we may assume X is afﬁne. Fix V ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et. Then i∗i∗F(V ) =
i∗F(V0) = F(f
V0). Now observe that f
V0 ⊔V |U →V is a pro-´etale cover. Since F(V |U) ̸= ∅(as F is
pointed), one easily checks that any section in i∗i∗F(V ) lifts to a section of F over f
V0 ⊔V |U, which proves
surjectivity.
□
Remark 6.1.10. Lemma 6.1.9 needs F to be pointed. For a counterexample without this hypothesis, take:
X = U ⊔Z a disjoint union of two non-empty schemes U and Z, and F = i!Z, where i : Z →X is the
clopen immersion with complement j : U →X.
Lemma 6.1.11. For any pointed sheaf F ∈Shv(Xpro´et), we have j!j∗F ≃ker(F →i∗i∗F).
Proof. We may assume X is afﬁne. For any V ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et, we ﬁrst observe that the sheaf axiom for the cover
f
V0 ⊔V |U →V gives a ﬁbre square of pointed sets
F(V )
/

F(V |U)

F(f
V0)
/ F(f
V0|U).
In particular, ker(F(V ) →F(f
V0)) ≃ker(F(V |U) →F(f
V0|U)). Now i∗i∗F(V ) = F(f
V0), so we must
show that j!j∗F(U) = ker(F(V ) →F(f
V0)) ≃ker(F(V |U) →F(f
V0|U)). By deﬁnition, j!j∗F is the sheaf
associated to the presheaf F ′ deﬁned via: F ′(V ) = F(V ) if V →X factors through U, and F ′(V ) = 0
otherwise. The sheaf axiom for the cover f
V0 ⊔V |U →V then shows that j!j∗F is also the sheaf associated
to the presheaf F ′′ given by F ′′(V ) = ker(F(V |U) →F(f
V0|U)), which proves the claim.
□
Lemma 6.1.12. One has the following identiﬁcation of functors at the level of unbounded derived cate-
gories:
(1) i∗i∗≃id and j∗j! ≃j∗j∗≃id.
(2) j∗i∗≃0, and i∗j! ≃0.
43

Proof. By deriving Lemma 6.1.11, there is an exact triangle j!j∗→id →i∗i∗of endofunctors on D(Xpro´et).
Then (2) follows from (1) by applying i∗and j∗to this triangle. The second part of (1) is a general fact
about monomorphisms U ֒→X in a topos. For i∗i∗≃id, we use that both functors are exact to reduce to
the claim at the level of abelian categories, where it follows from eV0 ≃V for any V ∈Zaﬀ
pro´et.
□
Lemma 6.1.13. The pushforward j! : D(Upro´et) →D(Xpro´et) commutes with homotopy-limits.
Proof. By Lemma 6.1.11, for any K ∈D(Upro´et), we have the following exact triangle:
j!K →j∗K →i∗i∗j∗K.
Since j∗, i∗and i∗all commute with homotopy-limits, the same is true for j!.
□
Remark 6.1.14. One can show a more precise result than Lemma 6.1.13. Namely, the pushforward j! :
D(Upro´et) →D(Xpro´et) admits a left-adjoint j# : D(Xpro´et) →D(Upro´et) which is deﬁned at the level of
free abelian sheaves as follows: given V ∈Xpro´et, we have j#(ZV ) = cok(Zf
V0|U →ZV |U) ≃cok(Zf
V0 →
ZV ).
We record some special cases of the proper base change theorem:
Lemma 6.1.15. Consider the diagram
f −1Z
i
/
f

Y
f

f −1U
f

j

o
For any K ∈D(Upro´et) and L ∈D(Zpro´et), we have
i∗f ∗L ≃f ∗i∗L
and
j!f ∗K ≃f ∗j!K.
Proof. Note that i∗f ∗i∗L ≃f ∗i∗i∗L ≃f ∗L. Hence, using the sequence j!j∗→id →i∗i∗of functors, to
prove the claim for L, it sufﬁces to show j∗f ∗i∗L ≃0; this is clear as j∗f ∗i∗≃f ∗j∗i∗≃0, since j∗i∗≃0.
The second claim follows by an analogous argument using i∗j! ≃0.
□
We end by noting that i∗also admits a right adjoint:
Lemma 6.1.16. The functor i∗: D(Zpro´et) →D(Xpro´et) admits a right adjoint i! : D(Xpro´et) →
D(Zpro´et). For any K ∈D(Xpro´et), there is an exact triangle
i∗i!K →K →j∗j∗K.
Proof. The functor i∗: D(Zpro´et) →D(Xpro´et) commutes with arbitrary direct sums. As all triangu-
lated categories in sight are compactly generated, one formally deduces the existence of i!. For the exact
triangle, write L for the homotopy-kernel of K →j∗j∗K. One has a natural map η : i∗i!K →L since
RHom(i∗i!K, j∗j∗K) = 0. We ﬁrst show η is an isomorphism through its functor of points. For this, note
that for any M ∈D(Zpro´et), one has
RHom(i∗M, i∗i!K) = RHom(M, i!K) = RHom(i∗M, K) = RHom(i∗M, L),
where the ﬁrst equality uses the full faithfulness of i∗, the second comes from the deﬁnition of i!, and the
last one uses RHom(i∗M, j∗j∗K) = 0. This proves that η is an isomorphism. One also has L = i∗i∗L as
j∗L = 0, so the claim follows by full faithfulness of i∗.
□
Finite morphisms are acyclic under ﬁnite presentation constraints:
Lemma 6.1.17. If f : X →Y is ﬁnitely presented and ﬁnite, then f∗: Ab(Xpro´et) →Ab(Ypro´et) is exact.
Proof. This follows from Lemma 2.4.10.
□
44

6.2. Functoriality for locally closed immersions. We ﬁx a qcqs scheme X, a locally closed constructible
subset k : W ֒→X. We write DW (Xpro´et) for the full subcategory spanned by K ∈D(Xpro´et) with
K|X−W ≃0; we refer to such objects as “complexes supported on W.”
Lemma 6.2.1. Fix i : Z ֒→X a constructible closed immersion with complement j : U ֒→X. Then one
has:
(1) The functor j! establishes an equivalence D(Upro´et) ≃DU(Xpro´et) with inverse j∗.
(2) The functor i∗establishes an equivalence D(Zpro´et) ≃DZ(Xpro´et) with inverse i∗.
(3) The functor k∗establishes an equivalence DW(Xpro´et) ≃D(Wpro´et).
Proof. For (1), we know that j∗j! ≃id, so j! is fully faithful. Also, an object K ∈D(Xpro´et) is supported on
U if and only if i∗K ≃0 if and only if j!j∗K ≃K, which proves (1). The proof of (2) is analogous. For (3),
ﬁx a factorization W
f→W
g→X with f an open immersion, and g a constructible closed immersion. Then
g∗induces an equivalence D(W pro´et) ≃DW (Xpro´et) with inverse g∗by (2), and hence restricts to an equiv-
alence DW(W pro´et) ≃DW (Xpro´et). Similarly, f! induces an equivalence D(Wpro´et) ≃DW (W pro´et) with
inverse f ∗by (1). Hence, the composition k! := g∗◦f! induces an equivalence D(Wpro´et) ≃DW (Xpro´et)
with inverse k∗.
□
Deﬁnition 6.2.2. The functor k! : D(Wpro´et) →D(Xpro´et) is deﬁned as the composition D(Wpro´et)
a→
DW (Xpro´et)
b→D(Xpro´et), where a is the equivalence of Lemma 6.2.1 (inverse to k∗), and b is the deﬁning
inclusion.
Lemma 6.2.3. One has:
(1) The functor k! is fully faithful, preserves homotopy-limits, and has a left inverse given by k∗.
(2) For any map f : Y →X of qcqs schemes, one has k! ◦f ∗≃f ∗◦k! as functors D(Wpro´et) →
D(Ypro´et).
(3) For any K ∈D(Wpro´et) and L ∈D(Xpro´et), we have k!K ⊗L ≃k!(K ⊗i∗L).
(4) One has k! ◦ν∗≃ν∗◦k! as functors D(W´et) →D(Xpro´et).
(5) The functor k! admits a right adjoint k! : D(Xpro´et) →D(Wpro´et).
Proof. (1) follows from the proof of Lemma 6.2.1 as both f! and g∗have the same properties. (2) follows
by two applications of Lemma 6.1.15. For (3), it sufﬁces to separately handle the cases where k is an open
immersion and k is a closed immersion. The case of an open immersion (or, more generally, any weakly
´etale map k : W →X) follows by general topos theory and adjunction. Hence, we may assume k is a
closed immersion with open complement j : U ֒→X, so k! ≃k∗. For any K′ ∈D(Xpro´et), we have the
triangle
j!j∗K′ →K′ →k∗k∗K′.
Tensoring this triangle with L and using the projection formula for j shows k∗k∗K′⊗L ≃k∗
 k∗K′ ⊗k∗L).
Setting K′ = k∗K then proves the claim as k∗k∗≃id. For (4), assume ﬁrst that k is an open immersion.
Then ν∗◦k∗≃k∗◦ν∗as functors D(Xpro´et) →D(U´et) (which is true for any U →X in X´et). Passing
to adjoints then proves k! ◦ν∗≃ν∗◦k!. Now assume k is a constructible closed immersion with open
complement j : U ֒→X. Then for any K ∈D(X´et), there is a triangle
j!j∗K →K →i∗i∗K
in D(X´et). Applying ν∗and using the commutativity of ν∗with j!, j∗and i∗then proves the claim. (5)
follows by considering the case of open and constructible closed immersions separately, and using Lemma
6.1.16.
□
All the results in this section, except the continuity of k!, are also valid in the ´etale topology.
6.3. Constructible complexes in the ´etale topology. The material of this section is standard, but we in-
clude it for completeness. We ﬁx a qcqs scheme X, and a ring F. Given an F-complex L ∈D(F), we
write L for the associated constant complex, i.e., its image under the pullback D(F) →D(X´et, F).
Deﬁnition 6.3.1. A complex K ∈D(X´et, F) is called constructible if there exists a ﬁnite stratiﬁcation
{Xi →X} by constructible locally closed Xi ⊂X such that K|Xi is locally constant with perfect values
on X´et.
45

Remark 6.3.2. One classically replaces the perfectness hypothesis in Deﬁnition 6.3.1 with a weaker ﬁnite-
ness constraint. However, imposing perfectness is more natural from the derived point of view: under mild
conditions on X, our deﬁnition picks out the compact objects of D(X´et, F) (see Proposition 6.4.8), and is
stable under the six operations. Moreover, the two approaches coincide when F is a ﬁeld.
Lemma 6.3.3. Any K ∈Dcons(X´et, F) admits a ﬁnite ﬁltration with graded pieces of the form i!L with
i : Y ֒→X ranging through a stratiﬁcation of X, and L ∈D(Y´et, F) locally constant with perfect values.
Proof. Same as in the classical case, see [SGA73, Proposition IX.2.5].
□
Lemma 6.3.4. Each K ∈Dcons(X´et, F) has ﬁnite ﬂat dimension.
Proof. By Lemma 6.3.3, we may assume K = i!L for i : Y ֒→X locally closed constructible, and
L ∈D(Y´et, F) locally constant with perfect values. By the projection formula, it sufﬁces to show L has
ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. As we are free to localize, we may assume L = K′ with K′ ∈Dperf(F), whence the
claim is clear.
□
Lemma 6.3.5. Dcons(X´et, F) ⊂D(X´et, F) is closed under tensor products.
Proof. Clear.
□
Lemma 6.3.6. Given K ∈D(R) and s ∈H0(X´et, K), there exists an ´etale cover {Ui →X} such that
s|Ui comes from si ∈H0(K).
Proof. Fix a geometric point x : Spec(k) →X, and consider the coﬁltered category I of factorizations
Spec(k) →U →X of x with U →X ´etale. Then K ≃colim RΓ(U´et, K) where the colimit is indexed
by Iop: the exact functor x∗(F) = colimI F(U) gives a point x : Set →X´et, and the composition
(Set, F)
x→(X´et, F) can
→(Set, F) is the identity. This gives a section si ∈H0(K) by passage to the limit.
As ﬁltered colimits are exact, one checks that s agrees with the pullback of si over some neighbourhood
U →X in I. Performing this construction for each geometric point then gives the desired ´etale cover.
□
Lemma 6.3.7. If K ∈Db(X´et, F) has locally constant cohomology sheaves, then there is an ´etale cover
{Ui →X} such that K|Ui is constant.
Proof. We may assume all cohomology sheaves of K are constant. If K has only one non-zero coho-
mology sheaf, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, choose the maximal i such that Hi(K) ̸= 0. Then
K ≃ker(Hi(K)[−i]
s→τ <iK[1]). By induction, both Hi(K) and τ <iK can be assumed to be constant.
The claim now follows by Lemma 6.3.6 applied to RHom(Hi(K)[−i], τ <iK[1]) with global section s;
here we use that the pullback G : D(F) →D(X´et, F) preserves RHom between A, B ∈Db(F) since
G(R lim Ci) = R lim G(Ci) if {Ci ֒→C} is the stupid ﬁltration on C ∈D+(R) (with C = RHom(A, B)
calculated by a projective resolution of A).
□
Lemma 6.3.8. A complex K ∈D(X´et, F) is constructible if and only if for any ﬁnite stratiﬁcation {Yi →
X}, the restriction K|Yi is constructible.
Proof. The forward direction is clear as constructible sheaves are closed under pullback. For the reverse, it
sufﬁces to observe k! preserves constructibility for k : W ֒→X locally closed constructible as k identiﬁes
constructible subsets of W with those of X contained in W.
□
Lemma 6.3.9. Dcons(X´et, F) is a triangulated idempotent complete subcategory of D(X´et, F). It can be
characterized as the minimal such subcategory that contains all objects of the form k!L with k : Y ֒→X
locally closed constructible, and L ∈D(Y´et, F) locally constant with perfect values.
Proof. To show Dcons(X´et, F) is closed under triangles, by reﬁning stratiﬁcations, it sufﬁces to check: if
K, L ∈D(X´et, F) are locally constant with perfect values, then the cone of any map K →L has the same
property. Replacing X by a cover, we may assume K = K′ and L = L′ with K′, L′ ∈Dperf(R). The
claim now follows from Lemma 6.3.6 applied to RHom(K′, L′). The idempotent completeness is proven
similarly. The last part follows from Lemma 6.3.3 and the observation that each k!L (as in the statement) is
indeed constructible.
□
46

Lemma 6.3.10. Constructibility is local on X´et, i.e., given K ∈D(X´et, F), if there exists a cover {fi :
Xi →X} in X´et with f ∗
i K constructible, then K is constructible.
Proof. We may assume f : Y →X is a surjective ´etale map, and f ∗K is constructible. First assume that f
is a ﬁnite ´etale cover. Passing to Galois closures (and a clopen cover of X if necessary), we may assume f
is ﬁnite Galois with group G. By reﬁning strata, we can assume f ∗K is locally constant along a G-invariant
stratiﬁcation of Y . Such a stratiﬁcation is pulled back from X, so the claim is clear. In general, there is a
stratiﬁcation of X over which f is ﬁnite ´etale, so one simply applies the previous argument to the strata.
□
Lemma 6.3.11. If j : U →X is qcqs ´etale, then j! : D(U´et, F) →D(X´et, F) preserves constructibility.
Proof. If j is ﬁnite ´etale, then the claim follows by Lemma 6.3.10 as any ﬁnite ´etale cover of X is, locally
on X´et, of the form ⊔n
i=1X →X. In general, there is a stratiﬁcation of X over which this argument
applies.
□
Lemma 6.3.12. If K ∈D(X´et, F), and I ⊂F is a nilpotent ideal such that K⊗F F/I ∈Dcons(X´et, F/I),
then K ∈Dcons(X´et, F).
Proof. We may assume I2 = 0. By devissage, we may assume K1 = K ⊗F F/I is locally constant with
perfect value L1 ∈Dperf(F/I). By passage to an ´etale cover, we may assume K1 ≃L1. After further
coverings, Lemma 6.3.7 shows K ≃L for some L ∈D(F). Since L ⊗F F/I ≃L1 is perfect, so is L (by
the characterization of perfect complexes as compact objects of D(F) and the 5 lemma).
□
Lemma 6.3.13. Constructibility is local in the pro-´etale topology on X, i.e., given K ∈D(X´et, F), if there
exists a cover {fi : Xi →X} in Xpro´et with f ∗
i K constructible, then K is constructible.
Proof. We may assume X is afﬁne, and that there exists a pro-´etale afﬁne f : Y = limi Yi →X covering
X with f ∗K constructible. The stratiﬁcation on Y witnessing the constructibility of f ∗K is deﬁned over
some Yi. Hence, after replacing X by an ´etale cover, we may assume that there exists a stratiﬁcation
{Xi ֒→X} such that f ∗K is constant with perfect values over f −1(Xi). Replacing X by Xi, we may
assume f ∗K ≃f ∗L with L ∈Dperf(F). Then the isomorphism f ∗L →f ∗K is deﬁned over some Yi
(since L is perfect), so K|Yi is constant.
□
Lemma 6.3.14. If K ∈Dcons(X´et, F), then RHom(K, −) commutes with all direct sums with terms in
D≥0(X´et, F).
Proof. Let CX ⊂Db(X´et, F) denote the full (triangulated) subcategory spanned by those M for which
RHom(M, −) commutes with all direct sums in D≥0(X´et, F). Then one checks:
(1) For any M ∈Dperf(F), one has M ∈CX.
(2) For any qcqs ´etale map j : U →X, the functor j! carries CU to CX.
(3) The property of lying in CX can be detected locally on X´et.
(4) M ∈D(X´et, F) lies in CX if and only if RHom(M|U, −) commutes with direct sums in D≥0(U´et, F)
for each qcqs U ∈X´et.
By (4), it sufﬁces to show that a constructible complex K lies in CX. By Lemma 6.3.3, we may assume
K = k!L with k : Y ֒→X locally closed constructible, and L ∈D(Y´et, F) locally constant with perfect
values. Choose a qcqs open j : U ֒→X with i : Y ֒→U a constructible closed subset. Then K = k!L ≃
(j! ◦i∗)L. By (2), it sufﬁces to show that i∗K ∈CU, i.e., we reduce to the case where k is a constructible
closed immersion with open complement h : V ֒→X. The assumption on K gives a qcqs ´etale cover
g : Y ′ →Y with g∗L ≃M for M ∈Dperf(F). By passing to a cover of X reﬁning g over Y , using (3),
we may assume that L = M. Then the exact triangle
h!M →M →K
and (1) and (2) above show that K ∈CX, as wanted.
□
Remark 6.3.15. It is crucial to impose the boundedness condition in Lemma 6.3.14: if the cohomological
dimension of X is unbounded, then RHom(F, −) ≃RΓ(X´et, −) does not commute with arbitrary direct
sums in D(X´et, F).
47

Lemma 6.3.16. For K ∈Dcons(X´et, F) and L ∈D+(X´et, F), one has
ν∗RHom(K, L) ≃RHom(ν∗K, ν∗L) .
Proof. Fix U = limi Ui ∈Xaﬀ
pro´et, and write j : U →X and ji : Ui →X for the structure maps. By
evaluating on pro-´etale afﬁnes, it sufﬁces to check RHom(j∗K, j∗L) ≃colimi RHom(j∗
i K, j∗
i L). By ad-
junction, this is equivalent to requiring RHom(K, j∗j∗L) ≃colimi RHom(K, ji,∗j∗
i L). If L ∈D≥k(X´et),
then ji,∗j∗
i L ∈D≥k(X´et) for all i, so the claim follows from Lemma 6.3.14.

6.4. Constructible complexes as compact objects. The material of this section is not used in the sequel.
However, these results do not seem to be recorded in the literature, so we include them here. We ﬁx a qcqs
scheme X, and a ring F. We assume that all afﬁne U ∈X´et have F-cohomological dimension ≤d for
some ﬁxed d ∈N. The main source of examples is:
Example 6.4.1. If X is a variety over a separably closed ﬁeld k and F is torsion, then it satisﬁes the above
assumption. Indeed, Artin proved that Hi(U´et, F) = 0 for i > dim(U) if U is an afﬁne k-variety.
Recall that K ∈D(X´et, F) is compact if RHom(K, −) commutes with arbitrary direct sums. Let
Dc(X´et, F) ⊂D(X´et, F) be the full subcategory of compact objects. Our goal is to identify Dc(X´et, F)
with the category of constructible complexes. We start by recording a completeness property of D(X´et, F):
Lemma 6.4.2. For any qcqs U ∈X´et, the functor RΓ(U´et, −) has ﬁnite F-cohomological dimension.
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that U = V1 ∪V2 with Vi ⊂U open afﬁnes, and W := V1 ∩V2 afﬁne. Then one has an
exact triangle
RΓ(U´et, −) →RΓ(V1,´et, −) ⊕RΓ(V2,´et, −) →RΓ(W´et, −)
which gives the desired ﬁniteness. The general case is handled by induction using a similar argument, by
passing through the separated case ﬁrst.
□
Lemma 6.4.3. The category D(X´et, F) is left-complete.
Proof. This follows from Proposition 3.3.7.
□
Lemma 6.4.4. For any j : U →X in X´et, the pushforward j! : D(U´et, F) →D(X´et, F) preserves
compact objects.
Proof. Formal by adjunction since j∗preserves all direct sums.
□
Lemma 6.4.5. For each qcqs j : U →X in X´et, we have:
(1) The object j!F ∈D(X´et, F) is compact.
(2) The functor j∗: D(U´et, F) →D(X´et, F) commutes with all direct sums.
Proof. For (1), by Lemma 6.4.4, we may assume j = id, so we want RΓ(X, −) to preserve all direct sums.
We ﬁrst observe that the ﬁniteness assumption on X and the corresponding left-completeness of D(X´et, F)
give: for any K ∈D(X´et, F), one has Hi(X, K) ≃Hi(X, τ ≥−nK) for n > NX −i, where NX is the
F-cohomological dimension of X. One then immediately reduces to the bounded below case, which is
true for any qcqs scheme. For (2), ﬁx some qcqs V ∈X´et, and let W = U ×X V . Then (1) shows that
RΓ(V´et, −) commutes with direct sums. Hence, given any set {Ks} of objects in D(U´et, F), we have
RΓ(V´et, ⊕sj∗Ks) ≃⊕sRΓ(V´et, j∗Ks) ≃⊕sRΓ(W´et, Ks|W) ≃RΓ(W´et, (⊕sKs)|W ) ≃RΓ(V´et, j∗⊕sKs).
As this is true for all V , the claim follows.
□
Lemma 6.4.6. Fix a closed constructible subset i : Z ֒→X and K ∈D(Z´et, F) that is locally constant
with perfect value L ∈Dperf(F). Then i∗K ∈D(X´et, F) is compact.
Proof. By Lemma 6.4.5 (2), it sufﬁces to show the following statement: the functor RHom(i∗K, −) :
D(X´et, F) →D(X´et, F) commutes with direct sums. To check this, we may freely replace X with an
´etale cover. By passing to a suitable cover (see the proof of Lemma 6.3.14), we may assume K = L for
L ∈Dperf(F). If j : U →X denotes the qcqs open complement of i, then the exact triangle
j!L →L →i∗L
ﬁnishes the proof by Lemma 6.4.5 (1)
□

Remark 6.4.7. The constructibility of Z in Lemma 6.4.6 is necessary. For a counterexample without this
hypothesis, choose an inﬁnite proﬁnite set S and a closed point i : {s} ֒→S. Then S −{s} is not
quasi-compact, so Z is not constructible. Using stalks, one checks that i∗F ≃colim j∗F, where the col-
imit is indexed by clopen neighbourhoods j : U ֒→S of s ∈S. For such j, one has H0(S, j∗F) =
H0(U, F) = Mapconts(U, F). As any continuous map f : U →F is locally constant, each non-zero sec-
tion of H0(S, j∗F) is supported on some clopen V ⊂U. As 1 ∈H0(S, i∗F) is supported only at s, all
maps i∗F →j∗F are constant, so i∗F is not compact in D(S, F). To get an example with schemes, one
simply tensors this example with a geometric point, in the sense of Example 4.1.9.
Proposition 6.4.8. D(X´et, F) is compactly generated, and Dc(X´et, F) = Dcons(X´et, F).
Proof. We temporarily use the word “coherent” to refer to objects of the form j!F for qcqs maps j : U →X
in X´et. Lemma 6.4.5 shows that coherent objects are compact. General topos theory shows that all objects
in D(X´et, F) can be represented by complexes whose terms are direct sums of coherent objects, so it
follows that D(X´et, F) is compactly generated. Furthermore, one formally checks that the subcategory
Dc(X´et, F) ⊂D(X´et, F) of compact objects is the smallest idempotent complete triangulated subcategory
that contains the coherent objects. Then Lemma 6.3.11 shows Dc(X´et, F) ⊂Dcons(X´et, F). For the reverse
inclusion Dcons(X´et, F) ⊂Dc(X´et, F), it sufﬁces to show: for any k : W ֒→X locally closed constructible
and L ∈D(W´et, F) locally constant with perfect values, the pushforward K := k!L is compact. Choose
W
f→U
g→X with f a constructible closed immersion, and g a qcqs open immersion. Then f∗K is
compact in D(U´et, F) by Lemma 6.4.6, so k!K ≃g!f∗K is compact by Lemma 6.4.4.
□
6.5. Constructible complexes in the pro-´etale topology. Fix a qcqs scheme X, and a noetherian ring
R complete for the topology deﬁned by an ideal m ⊂R. Set bRX := lim R/mn ∈Shv(Xpro´et); we
often simply write bR for bRX. In fact, in the notation of Lemma 4.2.12, bR = bRX is the sheaf FR on
Xpro´et associated with the topological ring R. We write L for the image of L ∈D(R) under the pullback
D(R) →D(Xpro´et, R), and bL ∈D(Xpro´et, bR) for the m-adic completion of L. When L = R or R/mn,
we drop the underline. The key deﬁnition is:
Deﬁnition 6.5.1. We say that K ∈D(Xpro´et, bR) is constructible if K is m-adically complete, and K ⊗L
bR
R/m is obtained via pullback of a constructible R/m-complex under ν : Xpro´et →X´et. Write
Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) ⊂D(Xpro´et, bR)
for the full subcategory spanned by constructible complexes.
It is immediate that Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) is a triangulated subcategory of D(Xpro´et, bR). Applying the same
deﬁnition to (R/mn, m), we get Dcons(Xpro´et, R/mn) ≃Dcons(X´et, R/mn) via ν; note that the two evident
deﬁnitions of Dcons(X´et, R/mn) coincide by Lemma 6.3.12.
Example 6.5.2. When X is a geometric point, pullback induces an equivalence Dperf(R) ≃Dcons(Xpro´et, bR).
Lemma 6.5.3. Each K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) is bounded.
Proof. Completeness gives K ≃R lim(K ⊗L
R R/mn). As R lim has cohomological dimension ≤1 by
repleteness, it sufﬁces to show Kn := K ⊗L
R R/mn has amplitude bounded independent of n. This follows
from standard sequences as K1 has ﬁnite ﬂat dimension.
□
Lemma 6.5.4. If K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR), then K ⊗bR R/mn ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, R/mn) for each n.
Proof. This is immediate from K ⊗bR R/mn ⊗R/mn R/m ≃K ⊗bR R/m.
□
Lemma 6.5.5. Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) ⊂Dcomp(Xpro´et, bR) is closed under tensor products. In fact, if K, L ∈
Dcons(Xpro´et, bR), then K ⊗bR L is already complete.
Proof. The assertion is local on Xpro´et. By ﬁltering K and L, and replacing X by a cover, we may assume:
X is w-contractible and henselian along a constructible closed subset i : Z ֒→X, and K = i∗c
M and
L = i∗bN for M, N ∈Dperf(R). By realising M and N as direct summands of ﬁnite free R-complexes, we
49

reduce to M = N = R. Let j : U →X be the open complement of i. We claim the more precise statement
that i∗bR ⊗bR i∗bR ≃i∗bR. For this, using the sequence
j! bR →bR →i∗bR,
we are reduced to checking that j! bR ⊗bR i∗bR = 0, which is automatic by adjunction: for any K ∈
D(Upro´et, bR) and L ∈D(Zpro´et, bR), one has
RHom(j!K ⊗bR i∗L, −) = RHom(j!K, RHom(i∗L, −)) = RHom(K, RHom(j∗i∗L, j∗(−))) = 0,
where the last equality uses j∗i∗= 0.
□
Lemma 6.5.6. Fix K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) with K ⊗bR R/m constant locally on X´et. Then K ⊗bR R/mn is
also constant locally on X´et.
Proof. Since the question concerns only complexes pulled back from X´et, we can ´etale localize to assume
that (X, x) is a local strictly henselian scheme. Then the assumption implies K ⊗bR R/m is constant.
Moreover, one easily checks that D(R/mn) →D(X´et, R/mn) is fully faithful (as RΓ(X´et, −) ≃x∗).
Chasing triangles shows that each K ⊗bR R/mn is in the essential image of D(R/mn) →D(X´et, R/mn),
as wanted.
□
Corollary 6.5.7. Assume X is a strictly henselian local scheme. Then pullback
Dperf(R) →Dcons(Xpro´et, bR)
is fully faithful with essential image those K with K ⊗bR R/m locally constant.
Proof. The full faithfulness is automatic since RΓ(X, bR) ≃R lim RΓ(X, R/mn) ≃R lim R/mn ≃R.
The rest follows by Lemma 6.5.6.
□
Lemma 6.5.8. Fix a locally closed constructible subset k : W ֒→X.
(1) One has k∗( bRX) = bRW.
(2) The functor k∗: D(Xpro´et, bRX) →D(Wpro´et, bRW ) preserves constructible complexes.
(3) The functor k! : D(Wpro´et, bRW ) →D(Xpro´et, bRX) preserves constructible complexes.
Proof. (1) follows from the fact that k∗: Shv(Xpro´et) →Shv(Wpro´et) commutes with limits (as this is
true for constructible open and closed immersions). This also implies k∗(K ⊗bRX R/m) ≃k∗K ⊗bRW R/m
for any K ∈D(Xpro´et, bRX), which gives (2). The projection formula for k! shows k!K ⊗bRX R/m ≃
k!(K ⊗bRW R/m), which gives (3).
□
Lemma 6.5.9. Let f : X →Y be a map of qcqs schemes, and let f∗: D(Xpro´et, bR) →D(Ypro´et, bR) be
the pushforward. Then we have:
(1) For K ∈D(Xpro´et, bR), we have an identiﬁcation {f∗K ⊗bR R/mn} ≃{f∗(K ⊗bR R/mn)} of
pro-objects.
(2) For K ∈D(Xpro´et, bR), we have f∗bK ≃d
f∗K. In particular, f∗preserves m-adically complete
complexes, and hence induces f∗: Dcomp(Xpro´et, bR) →Dcomp(Ypro´et, bR).
(3) For any perfect complex L ∈D(R), we have f∗K ⊗bR bL ≃f∗(K ⊗bR bL).
(4) Pullback followed by completion gives f ∗
comp : Dcomp(Xpro´et, bR) →Dcomp(Ypro´et, bR) left adjoint
to f∗.
(5) f ∗
comp preserves constructible complexes, and hence deﬁnes
f ∗
comp : Dcons(Ypro´et, bR) →Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) .
Proof. (1) would be clear if each R/mn is R-perfect. To get around this, choose P and J as in the proof
of Proposition 3.5.1. Then {R ⊗P P/Jn} ≃{R/mn} is a strict pro-isomorphism, so {K ⊗R R/mn} ≃
{K ⊗P P/Jn} as pro-objects as well, and similarly for f∗K. The claim now follows as P/Jn is P-perfect.
(2) immediately follows from (1) (or simply because T(f∗K, x) ≃f∗T(K, x) ≃0 for x ∈m and K is
complete as f∗commutes with R lim). (3) immediately follows from the case L = R by devissage, while
50

(4) follows from (2) by adjointness of completion. For (5), as f ∗commutes with tensor products, we have
f ∗
comp(K) ⊗bRY R/m ≃f ∗(K ⊗bRX R/m), so the claim follows from preservation of constructibility under
pullbacks in the classical sense.
□
Remark 6.5.10. When f : X →Y is a ﬁnite composition of qcqs weakly ´etale maps and constructible
closed immersion, we have f ∗
comp = f ∗, i.e., that f ∗K is complete if K is so; this follows from Lemma
6.5.8.
Lemma 6.5.9 shows that pushforwards in the pro-´etale topology commute with taking m-adic truncations
in the sense of pro-objects. To get strict commutation, we need a further assumption:
Lemma 6.5.11. Let f : X →Y be a map of qcqs schemes. Assume that f∗: Mod(X´et, R/m) →
Mod(Y´et, R/m) has cohomological dimension ≤d for some integer d. Then:
(1) If P ∈D≤k(R) and K ∈D≤m
cons(Xpro´et, bR), then f∗(K b⊗bR bP) ∈D≤k+m+d+2(Ypro´et, bR).
(2) If K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) and M ∈D−(R), then f∗(K b⊗bRc
M) ≃f∗K b⊗bRc
M.
(3) If K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR), then f∗K ⊗bR R/mn ≃f∗(K ⊗bR R/mn) for all n.
Proof. For (1), observe that
f∗(K b⊗bR bP) ≃f∗R lim(Kn ⊗R/mn Pn) ≃R lim f∗(Kn ⊗R/mn Pn) ∈D≤k+m+d+2(Ypro´et, bR),
where the last inclusion follows from Lemma 5.4.6 and repleteness. For (2), we may assume by shifting
that K ∈D≤0
cons(Xpro´et, bR). First observe that if M is a free R-module, then the claim is clear. For general
M, ﬁx an integer i and choose an i-close approximation Pi →M in D(R) with Pi a ﬁnite complex of free
R-modules, i.e., the homotopy-kernel Li lies in D≤−i(R). Then bPi →c
M is an i-close approximation in
D(Xpro´et, bR). Moreover, f∗(K b⊗bR bPi) ≃f∗K b⊗bR bPi as bPi is a ﬁnite complex of free bR-modules. We then
get a commutative diagram
f∗K b⊗bR bPi
a
/
b

f∗K b⊗bRc
M
c

f∗(K b⊗bR bPi)
d
/ f∗(K b⊗bRc
M).
Then b is an equivalence as explained above. The homotopy-kernel f∗(K b⊗bR bLi) of d is (−i + d + 2)-
connected by (1), and the homotopy-kernel f∗K b⊗bR bLi of a is (−i + d + 2)-connected since f∗K ≃
R lim f∗Kn ∈D≤d+1(Ypro´et). Thus, the homotopy-kernel of c is also (−i + d + 2)-connected. Let-
ting i →∞shows c is an isomorphism. (3) follows from (2) by setting M = R/mn, observing that R/mn
is already derived m-complete, and using −b⊗bRR/m ≃−⊗bR R/m as any R/m-complex is automatically
derived m-complete.
□
Remark 6.5.12. Unlike pullbacks, the pushforward along a map of qcqs schemes does not preserve con-
structibility: if it did, then H0(X, Z/2) would be ﬁnite dimensional for any qcqs scheme X over an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld k, which is false for X = Spec(Q∞
i=1 k). We will see later that there is no ﬁnite type
counterexample.
6.6. Constructible complexes on noetherian schemes. Fix X and R as in §6.5. Our goal in this section is
to prove that the notion of a constructible complexes on X coincides with the classical one from topology if
X is noetherian: K ∈D(Xpro´et, bR) is constructible if and only if it is locally constant along a stratiﬁcation,
see Proposition 6.6.11. In fact, it will be enough to assume that the topological space underlying X is
noetherian. The proof uses the notion of w-strictly local spaces, though a direct proof can be given for
varieties, see Remark 6.6.13.
For any afﬁne scheme Y , there is a natural morphism π : Y´et →π0(Y ) of sites. Our ﬁrst observation is
that π is relatively contractible when Y is w-strictly local.
Lemma 6.6.1. If Y is a w-strictly local afﬁne scheme, then pullback D(π0(Y )) →D(Y´et) is fully faithful.
51

Proof. Fix K ∈D(π0(Y ), F). Choose a point y ∈π0(Y ), and let y ∈Y be its unique preimage that is
closed. Then the projective system {π−1U} of open neighbourhoods of y obtained via pullback of open
neighbourhoods y ∈U in π0(Y ) is coﬁnal in the projective system {V } of all open neighbourhoods y ∈V
in Y . Hence,
colim
y∈U RΓ(U, π∗π∗K) ≃colim
y∈U RΓ(π−1U, π∗K) ≃colim
y∈V RΓ(V, π∗K) ≃(π∗K)y ≃Ky.
Here the penultimate isomorphism uses that the Zariski and ´etale localizations of Y at y coincide. This
shows that K →π∗π∗K induces an isomorphism on stalks, so must be an isomorphism. The rest follows
by adjunction.
□
For a proﬁnite set S, we deﬁne Spro´et := Spro´et, with ∗some ﬁxed geometric point, and S ∈Shv(∗pro´et)
the corresponding scheme. Alternatively, it is the site deﬁned by proﬁnite sets over S with covers determined
by ﬁnite families of continuous and jointly surjective maps, see Example 4.1.10. Using repleteness of
Shv(Spro´et), we show that a compatible system of constant perfect R/mn-complexes Ln on S has a constant
perfect limit L in Spro´et; the non-trivial point is that we do not a priori require the transition maps be
compatible with trivializations.
Lemma 6.6.2. Let S be a proﬁnite set. Fix L ∈Dcomp(Spro´et, bR) with L ⊗R R/mn constant with perfect
value Cn ∈D(R/mn) for all n. Then L is constant with perfect values.
Proof. Fix a point s ∈S. Passing to the stalks at s shows that there exists C ∈Dperf(R) with C⊗RR/mn ≃
Cn. Write bC ∈D(Spro´et, bR) and Cn ∈D(Spro´et, R/mn) for the corresponding constant complexes. We
will show Isom bR(L, bC) ̸= ∅. First observe that Exti
R/mn(Cn, Cn) ≃Mapconts(S, Exti
R/mn(Cn, Cn)). By
Lemma 6.6.3 and Lemma 6.6.6, the system {Exti
R/mn(Cn, Cn)} satisﬁes ML. As a map f : Cn →Cn
is an automorphism if and only if it is so modulo m, it follows that {AutR/mn(Cn)} also satisﬁes ML.
Lemma 6.6.4 and the assumption on Ln shows that {IsomR/mn(Ln, Cn)} satisﬁes ML. As the evident
map IsomR/mn(Ln, Cn) × Exti
R/mn(Cn, Cn) →Exti
R/mn(Ln, Cn) is surjective, Lemma 6.6.5 shows that
{Exti
R/mn(Ln, Cn)} satisﬁes ML. On the other hand, completeness gives
RHom bR(L, bC) ≃R lim RHomR/mn(Ln, Cn),
so
Hom bR(L, bC) ≃lim
n HomR/mn(Ln, Cn).
By completeness, a map f : L →bC is an isomorphism if and only f ⊗bR R/m is one, so Isom bR(L, bC) ≃
limn IsomR/mn(Ln, Cn). As {IsomR/mn(Ln, Cn)} satisﬁes ML with non-empty terms, the limit is non-
empty.
□
The next few lemmas record elementary facts about projective systems {Xn} of sets; for such a system,
we write X◦
n := ∩kim(Xn+k →Xn) ⊂Xn for the stable image.
Lemma 6.6.3. Fix a topological space S and a projective system {Xn} of sets satisfying the ML condition.
Then {Mapconts(S, Xn)} also satisﬁes the ML condition.
Proof. Fix n and N such that X◦
n = im(XN →Xn). Fix a continuous map f : S →Xn that lifts to
XN. Then f factors through a continuous map S →X◦
n. As {X◦
n} has surjective transition maps, the claim
follows.
□
Lemma 6.6.4. Let {Gn} be a projective system of groups, and let {Xn} be a compatible projective system
of transitive G-sets. Assume {Gn} satisﬁes ML and Xn ̸= ∅for all n. Then {Xn} satisﬁes ML, and
lim Xn ̸= ∅.
Proof. Note that any Nop-indexed system of non-empty sets satisfying the ML condition has a non-empty
inverse limit: the associated stable system has non-empty terms and surjective transition maps. Hence, it
sufﬁces to show {Xn} satisﬁes ML. Write hij : Gi →Gj and fij : Xi →Xj for the transition maps. Fix n
and N such that G◦
n = im(GN →Gn). Fix some xn ∈Xn that lifts to an xN ∈XN. For m ≥N, choose
some xm ∈Xm, and gN ∈GN with gN · fmN(xm) = xN; this is possible by transitivity. Then there exists
52

a gm ∈Gm with hmn(gm) = hNn(gn), so xm := g−1
m · xm ∈Xm lifts xn ∈Xn, which proves the ML
property.

Lemma 6.6.5. Let f : {Wn} →{Yn} be a map of projective systems. Assume that {Wn} satisﬁes ML, and
that fn : Wn →Yn is surjective. Then {Yn} satisﬁes ML.
Proof. Fix n, and choose N such that W ◦
n = im(WN →Wn). Then any yn ∈Yn that lifts to some
yN ∈YN further lifts to some wN ∈WN with image wn ∈Wn lifting yn. By choice of N, there is a
wn+k ∈Wn+k for all k lifting wn ∈Wn. The images yn+k := fn+k(wn+k) ∈Yn+k then lift yn ∈Yn for
all k, which proves the claim.

A version of the Artin-Rees lemma shows:
Lemma 6.6.6. For K ∈Dperf(R), the natural map gives pro-isomorphisms {Hi(K)/mn} ≃{Hi(K ⊗R
R/mn)}.
Proof. Let C be the category of pro-(R-modules), and consider the functor F : Modf
R →C given by
M 7→{M/mnM}. Then F is exact by the Artin-Rees lemma, so for any ﬁnite complex K of ﬁnitely
generated R-modules, one has F(Hi(K)) ≃Hi(F(K)). Applying this to a perfect K then proves the
claim.
□
Lemma 6.6.7. Let Y be a w-strictly local afﬁne scheme. Then any M ∈D(Y´et) that is locally constant on
Y´et is constant over a ﬁnite clopen cover, and hence comes from D(π0(Y )) via pullback.
Proof. For the ﬁrst part, we may assume that there exist ﬁnitely many qcqs ´etale maps fi : Ui →Y with
f : ⊔iUi →Y surjective such that f ∗
i M ≃Ai for some Ai ∈D(Ab). By w-strict locality, there is a section
s : Y →⊔iUi of f. Then {Vi := s−1Ui} is a ﬁnite clopen cover of Y with M|Vi ≃Ai ∈D(Vi,´et). Now
any ﬁnite clopen cover of Y is the pullback of a ﬁnite clopen cover of π0(Y ), so the second part follows.
□
Lemma 6.6.8. Let X = Spec(A) be connected. Fix K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) with K ⊗bR R/m locally
constant on X´et with perfect values. Then there exists a pro-´etale cover f : Y →X with f ∗K ≃C with
C ∈Dperf(R).
Proof. First observe that, by connectedness and examination of stalks in X´et, each Kn := K ⊗bR R/mn is
locally constant on X´et with the same perfect value Cn. Now choose a pro-´etale cover f : Y →X with
Y w-strictly local, and let π : Y →π0(Y ) be the natural map. Then Lemma 6.6.7 and Lemma 6.6.1 show
f ∗Kn ≃π∗Ln ≃π∗Cn, where Ln := π∗f ∗Kn ∈D(π0(Y ), R/mn), and the isomorphism Ln ≃Cn is
non-canonical. Lemma 6.6.1 shows that
Ln+1 ⊗R/mn+1 R/mn ≃π∗π∗(Ln+1 ⊗R/mn+1 R/mn) ≃π∗

f ∗Kn+1 ⊗R/mn+1 R/mn
≃π∗f ∗Kn = Ln
via the natural map Ln+1 →Ln. Applying Lemma 3.5.5 to {Ln} shows that L := π∗K ≃R lim Ln ∈
D(π0(Y )pro´et, bR) satisﬁes L ⊗bR R/mn ≃Ln. Lemma 6.6.2 then shows L ≃bC ∈D(π0(Y )pro´et, bR),
where C := R lim Cn ∈Dperf(R) is a stalk of K.
□
To state our result, we need the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.6.9. A scheme X is said to be topologically noetherian if its underlying topological space is
noetherian, i.e. any descending sequence of closed subsets is eventually constant.
Lemma 6.6.10. Let T be a topological space.
(1) If T is noetherian, then T is qcqs and has only ﬁnitely many connected components. Moreover, any
locally closed subset of T is constructible, and noetherian itself.
(2) If T admits a ﬁnite stratiﬁcation with noetherian strata, then T is noetherian.
(3) Assume that X is a topologically noetherian scheme, and Y →X ´etale. Then Y is topologically
noetherian.
Proof.
(1) Quasicompacity of T is clear. Also, the property of being noetherian passes to closed subsets,
as well as to open subsets. Thus, all open subsets are quasicompact; this implies that all locally
closed subsets are constructible, and that T is quasiseparated. Every connected component is an
53

intersection of open and closed subsets; this intersection has to be eventually constant, so that every
connected component is open and closed. By quasicompacity, there are only ﬁnitely many.
(2) Under this assumption, any descending sequence of closed subsets becomes eventually constant on
any stratum, and thus constant itself.
(3) There is a stratiﬁcation of X over which Y →X is ﬁnite ´etale. By (2), we may assume that Y →X
is ﬁnite ´etale. Any closed Z ⊂Y gives rise to a function fZ : X →N, mapping any x ∈X to
the cardinality of the ﬁbre of Z above a geometric point above x. As Z →X is ﬁnite, the function
fZ is upper semicontinuous, i.e. for all n, {x | fZ(x) ≥n} ⊂X is closed. Moreover, all fZ are
bounded independently of Z (by the degree of Y →X). Given a descending sequence of Z’s, one
gets a descending sequence of fZ’s. Thus, for any n, {x | fZ(x) ≥n} forms a descending sequence
of closed subsets of X, which becomes eventually constant. As there are only ﬁnitely many n of
interest, all these subsets are eventually constant. This implies that fZ is eventually constant, which
shows that Z is eventually constant, as desired.
□
Here is the promised result.
Proposition 6.6.11. Let X be a topologically noetherian scheme. A complex K ∈D(Xpro´et, bR) is con-
structible if and only if there exists a ﬁnite stratiﬁcation {Xi ֒→X} with K|Xi locally constant with perfect
values on Xi,pro´et.
The phrase “locally constant with perfect values” means locally isomorphic to bL ≃L ⊗R bR for some
L ∈Dperf(R).
Proof. For the forward direction, ﬁx K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR). By noetherian induction, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a
dense open U ⊂X such that K|U is locally constant with perfect values in D(Upro´et, bR). By assumption,
there exists a U ⊂X such that K|U ⊗bR R/m ∈D(U´et, R/m) is locally constant with perfect values. Any
topologically noetherian scheme has only ﬁnitely many (clopen) connected components. Thus, by passing
to connected components, we may assume U is connected. Lemma 6.6.8 then proves the claim. For the
reverse, ﬁx K ∈D(Xpro´et, bR), and assume there exists a ﬁnite stratiﬁcation {Xi ֒→X} such that K|Xi
is, locally on Xi,pro´et, the constant bR-complex associated to a perfect R-complex. Then K is complete
by Lemmas 6.5.8 and standard sequences (as completeness is a pro-´etale local property). For the rest, by
similar reasoning, we may assume that X is afﬁne and there exists a pro-´etale cover f : Y →X such that
K|Y ≃bL for a perfect R-complex L. Then K1 is locally constant with perfect value L1 on Xpro´et. Lemma
6.3.13 then shows that K1 is ´etale locally constant with perfect value L1, as wanted.
□
The next example shows the necessity of the noetherian hypothesis in Proposition 6.6.11:
Example 6.6.12. Fix an algebraically closed ﬁeld k, a prime number ℓ. Set Xn = Z/ℓn, and X = lim Xn =
Zℓ∈Spec(k)pro´et following the notation of Example 4.1.9, so X is qcqs. Consider the sheaf of rings
bR = lim Z/ℓn ∈Shv(Spec(k)pro´et); X represents bR, but we ignore this. We will construct a complex
K ∈D(Xpro´et, bR) satisfying:
(1) K ⊗L
bR Z/ℓis constant with perfect values over a ﬁnite clopen cover of X, so K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR).
(2) K is constant on the connected components of X with perfect values.
(3) There does not exist a ﬁnite stratiﬁcation {Xi ֒→X} with K|Xi locally constant on Xi,pro´et.
For each n, let K′
n ∈D(Xn,pro´et, Z/ℓn) be the locally constant complex whose value over the connected
component of Xn determined by α ∈Z/ℓn is

Z/ℓn
α→Z/ℓn
. Set Kn ∈D(Xpro´et, Z/ℓn) to be
its pullback to X. Then there is a coherent system of quasi-isomorphisms Kn+1 ⊗L
Z/ℓn+1 Z/ℓn ≃Kn.
Patching along these isomorphisms gives a complex K := R lim Kn ∈D(Xpro´et, bR) satisfying: for each
map fα : Spec(k) →X determined by an α ∈Zℓ, we have f ∗
αK ≃

Zℓ
α→Zℓ

. As X is totally
disconnected, (2) is clear. Since K ⊗bR Z/ℓ≃K1, one easily checks (1). Finally, as the stalks f ∗
αK over
α ∈X(k) take on inﬁnitely many disinct values, (3) follows.
54

Remark 6.6.13. When X is a variety over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k, it is easy to give a direct proof
that any K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) is locally constant along a stratiﬁcation, together with an explicit description
of the trivializing cover over each stratum. Indeed, as in Proposition 6.6.11, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a dense open
U ⊂X such that K|U is locally constant in D(Upro´et, bR). Replacing X by a suitable open, we may assume
(by Artin’s theorem [SGA73, §XI.3]) that:
(1) X is smooth, afﬁne, connected, and a K(π, 1), i.e., pullback along the canonical map Shv(X´et) →
Shv(Xf´et) induces a fully faithful functor D+(Xf´et, R/mn) →D+(X´et, R/mn)6.
(2) ν∗K1 is locally constant on X´et, i.e., pulled back from Xf´et.
The normalization of X in the maximal unramiﬁed extension of its fraction ﬁeld within a ﬁxed separable
closure gives a pro-(ﬁnite ´etale) cover f : Y →X. We will show f ∗K is constant. Note that Y is
afﬁne, connected, normal, and all ﬁnitely presented locally constant sheaves of R/mn-modules on Y´et are
constant by construction. In particular, each Hi(Kn) is constant over Y . Moreover, since X was a K(π, 1),
we have RΓ(Y´et, M) ≃M for any M ∈ModR/mn. Then the left-completeness of D(Ypro´et) formally
shows D(R/mn) →D(Ypro´et, R/mn) is fully faithful. Induction on the amplitude of Kn then shows
f ∗Kn ≃Cn for Cn := RΓ(Ypro´et, Kn) ∈D(R/mn). As K is constructible, each Cn is perfect (since
Cn = x∗f ∗Kn for any geometric point x of Y ), and Cn+1 ⊗R/mn+1 R/mn ≃Cn via the natural map. Then
C := R lim Cn ∈D(R) is perfect, and f ∗K ≃R lim f ∗Kn ≃R lim Cn =: bC ∈D(Ypro´et, bR), which
proves the claim.
6.7. The 6 functors. We ﬁx a complete noetherian local ring (R, m) with ﬁnite residue ﬁeld of character-
istic ℓ. We say that a scheme X is ℓ-coprime if ℓis invertible on X.
Theorem 6.7.1 (Grothendieck, Gabber). Let f : X →Y be a ﬁnitely presented map of qcqs schemes.
Assume either that f is proper, or that Y is quasi-excellent and ℓ-coprime. Then f∗: D(X´et, R/m) →
D(Y´et, R/m) has ﬁnite cohomological dimension and preserves constructibility.
Lemma 6.7.2 (Pushforward). Let f : X →Y be a ﬁnitely presented map of qcqs schemes. Assume
either that f is proper, or that Y is quasi-excellent and ℓ-coprime.
Then f∗: Dcomp(Xpro´et, bR) →
Dcomp(Ypro´et, bR) preserves constructibility. The induced functor f∗: Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) →Dcons(Ypro´et, bR)
is right adjoint to f ∗
comp.
Proof. Fix K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR). Then f∗K is complete by Lemma 6.5.9. Lemma 6.5.11 shows f∗K ⊗bR
R/m ≃f∗(K ⊗bR R/m), so constructibility follows Lemma 5.4.3 and Theorem 6.7.1; the adjunction is
automatic.
□
Remark 6.7.3. The ℓ-coprimality assumption in Lemma 6.7.2 is necessary: H1(A1
Fp, Fp) is inﬁnite di-
mensional.

If Y is quasi-excellent and f ﬁnitely presented, the preceding equality takes place in Dcons(Y ′

6By the Leray spectral sequence for Φ : (Shv(X´et), R/mn) →(Shv(Xf´et), R/mn) and devissage to reduce n, it sufﬁces
to check that Hi(Y´et, R/m) ≃Hi(Yf´et, R/m) for all i and all Y ∈Xf´et. By passage to suitable ﬁltered colimits, we may
assume R/m = Fℓor R/m = Q. If R/m = Fℓwith ℓ∈k∗, then the equality is due to Artin. If R/m = Fp with p zero in
k, then the Artin-Schreier sequence and the afﬁneness of Y show that RΦ∗Fp ≃Fp, which clearly sufﬁces. If R/m = Q, then
Hi(Yf´et, Q) = 0 by a trace argument; the normality of Y combined with examination at stalks shows that Q ≃Rη∗Q, where
η : Spec(K) →Y is the ﬁnite disjoint union of generic points of Y , which proves the claim by reduction to Galois cohomology.
55

Proof. Lemma 6.5.9 shows that {f∗K ⊗bR R/mn} ≃{f∗(K ⊗bR R/mn)} as pro-objects. By the con-
structibility assumption on K, each K ⊗bR R/mn is the pullback under ν of a constructible complex in
Db(X´et, R/mn), so f∗(K ⊗bR R/mn) is a pullback from D+(X´et, R/mn) by Lemma 5.4.3. The claim now
follows by deﬁnition of g∗
comp and classical smooth base change (which applies to D+(X´et, R/mn)).

□
Deﬁnition 6.7.6. Let f : X →Y be a separated ﬁnitely presented map of qcqs schemes. Then we deﬁne
f! : Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) →Dcons(Ypro´et, bR) as f∗◦j! where X
j֒→X
f→Y be a factorization with j an open
immersion, and f proper. If Y is a geometric point, we write RΓc(Xpro´et, K) := RΓ(Ypro´et, f!K).
Lemma 6.7.7. Deﬁnition 6.7.6 is well-deﬁned, i.e., f! is independent of choice of j and preserves con-
structibility.
Proof. This follows by the same argument used in the classical case thanks to Lemma 6.1.12.
□
Remark 6.7.8. Both j! and f∗are right adjoints at the level of abelian categories. However, the functor f!
from Deﬁnition 6.7.6 is not the derived functor of the composition f∗◦j! : Ab(Xpro´et) →Ab(Ypro´et), i.e.,
of H0(f!). To see this, take X →Y to be A1 →Spec(k) with k algebraically closed. Then we choose
j : X ֒→X to be A1 ⊂P1. It sufﬁces to check that the derived functors of F 7→Γ(X, j!F) fail to compute
RΓ(Y, f!F). Lemma 6.1.9 shows Γ(X, j!F) = ker(F(X) →F(eη)) where η →X is the generic point, and
eη →η →X is the restriction of the henselization at ∞on P1 to A1. The map eη →η is a pro-´etale cover,
so we can write Γ(X, j!F) = ker(F(X) →F(η)) for any F ∈Ab(Xpro´et). As η →X is a subobject in
Xpro´et, the map F(X) →F(η) is surjective for F injective. The derived functors of F 7→Γ(X, j!F) are
thus computed by the homotopy-kernel of the map
RΓ(X, F) →RΓ(η, F).
Taking F = Z/n for n ∈k∗shows H0(Ypro´et, R2H0(f!)F) ≃H1(η, Z/n) ̸= H2
c (A1, Z/n).
Remark 6.7.9. The phenomenon of Remark 6.7.8 also occurs in classical ´etale cohomology, i.e., f! does
not compute the derived functors of H0(f!). However, the reason is different. In the example considered in
Remark 6.7.8, if X0 ⊂X is the set of closed points, then
Γ(X, j!F) = ⊕x∈X0Γx(X, F),
for F ∈Ab(X´et) torsion; one checks this directly for constructible sheaves, and then observes that the
constructible ones generate all torsion sheaves on X´et under ﬁltered colimits. The derived functors of
F 7→Γ(X, j!F) are thus calculated by the homotopy-kernel of
⊕x∈X0RΓ(X, F) →⊕x∈X0RΓ(X −{x}, F).
Taking F = Z/n for n ∈k∗shows H0(Y´et, R2H0(f!)F) ≃⊕x∈X0H1(X −{x}, Z/n) ̸= H2
c (A1, Z/n).
Lemma 6.7.10 (Proper base change II). The conclusion of Lemma 6.7.5 is valid for any separated ﬁnitely
presented map f provided f∗is replaced by f!.
Proof. This follows from Lemma 6.7.5 and Lemma 6.2.3.

Lemma 6.7.11. Let i : Z ֒→X be a constructible locally closed immersion with X quasi-excellent
and ℓ-coprime. Then i! : D(Xpro´et, bR) →D(Zpro´et, bR) preserves constructible complexes, and the re-
sulting functor i! : Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) →Dcons(Zpro´et, bR) is a right adjoint to i! : Dcons(Zpro´et, bR) →
Dcons(Xpro´et, bR).
Proof. If i is an open immersion, then i! = i∗, so Lemma 6.5.8 settles the claim. Thus, we may assume i
is a closed immersion with open comelement j : U ֒→X. Fix K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR). There is an exact
triangle
i∗i!K →K →j∗j∗K.
Lemma 6.5.8 and Lemma 6.7.2 imply that j∗j∗K is constructible, and hence i∗i!K is also constructible.
Another application of Lemma 6.5.8 shows that i!K = i∗i∗i!K is also constructible.
□
Lemma 6.7.12 (⊗-products). Let X be a qcqs scheme. Then Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) ⊂D(Xpro´et, bR) is closed

Proof. This is Lemma 6.5.5.
□
Lemma 6.7.13 (Internal Hom). Let X be a quasi-excellent ℓ-coprime scheme. If K, L ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR),
then RHomR(K, L) ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR). Moreover, for any n ≥0, one has RHomR(K, L) ⊗bR R/mn ≃
RHomR/mn(K ⊗bR R/mn, L ⊗bR R/mn).
Proof. The assertion is local on X. By ﬁltering K, we may assume K = i! bR for i : Z ֒→X a con-
structible closed immersions. By adjointness, we have RHom(K, L) = i∗RHom( bR, i!L) ≃i∗i!L, which is
constructible by Lemma 6.7.11 and Lemma 6.7.2. The second assertion is proved similarly.
□
Lemma 6.7.14 (Projection Formula). Let f : X →Y be a separated ﬁnitely presented map of qcqs schemes.
For any L ∈Dcons(Ypro´et, bR) and K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR), we have f!K b⊗bRL ≃f!(K b⊗bRf ∗
compL) via the
natural map.
Proof. The assertion is local on Y . By ﬁltering L, we may assume L = i∗bR for i : Z ֒→Y a constructible
closed immersion. Let j : U ֒→X be the open complement of Z. For any bR-complex L, we have
L ⊗bR j!j∗bR ≃j!j∗L, and hence L ⊗bR i∗bR ≃i∗i∗L. Using this formula, the assertion now follows from
Lemma 6.7.10 as i∗= i∗
comp.
□
Remark 6.7.15. The analogue of Lemma 6.7.14 for f∗is false, even for quasiexcellent ℓ-coprime schemes.
Indeed, the projection formula for the special case L = i∗bR for i : Z ֒→X is equivalent to the base change
theorem as in Lemma 6.7.10, which fails for f∗.
Lemma 6.7.16. Let f : X →Y be a separated ﬁnitely presented map of qcqs schemes. For any K ∈
Dcons(X´et, R/mn) and M ∈Db(R), we have f!K ⊗R/mn M ≃f!(K ⊗R/mn M) ∈Db(Y´et, R/mn).
Proof. Lemma 6.5.11 (applied with bR = R/mn) proves the corresponding statement in the pro-´etale world,
i.e., after applying ν∗. It remains to observe that both sides of the desired equality lie in Db(Y´et, R/mn−1)
by Lemma 6.7.2 and the ﬁnite ﬂat dimensionality of constructible complexes, so we can apply ν∗to get the
claim.
□
Lemma 6.7.17. Let f : X →Y be a ﬁnitely presented map of quasi-excellent ℓ-coprime schemes. For
any K ∈Dcons(X´et, R/mn) and M ∈Db(R/mn), we have f∗K ⊗R/mn M ≃f∗(K ⊗R/mn M) ∈
Db(Y´et, R/mn).
Proof. This is proven exactly like Lemma 6.7.16.
□
Lemma 6.7.18. Let f : X →Y be a separated ﬁnitely presented map of quasiexcellent ℓ-coprime schemes.
Then f! : D+(X´et, R/mn) →D+(Y´et, R/mn) has a right adjoint f !
n. This adjoint preserves constructibil-

Here the horizontal maps are induced by restriction and extension of scalars along R/mm →R/mn re-
spectively.
Proof. The existence of f !
n and preservation of constructibility is classical. For the rest, we write Rn =
R/mn. The commutativity of the square on the left is equivalent to the commutativity of the corresponding
square of left adjoints, which follows from the projection formula in ´etale cohomology. For the square on
the right, ﬁx Km ∈Dcons(Y´et, Rm), and write Kn = Km ⊗Rm Rn ∈Dcons(Y´et, Rn). We must show
that f !
mKm ⊗Rm Rn ≃f !
nKn via the natural map f !
mKm →f !
mKm ≃f !
nKn. This assertion is local on
X, so we can factor f as X

dimension d. Since f !
m = i!
m ◦g!
m, it sufﬁces to prove the analogous claim for i and g separately. Since
g!
m = g∗
m(d)[2d], the assertion is immediate. For i, let j : U ֒→P be the open complement of i. Using
the triangle i∗i!
m →id →j∗j∗, it sufﬁces to show that j∗j∗Km ⊗Rm Rn ≃j∗j∗Kn, which follows from
Lemma 6.7.17.

Lemma 6.7.19 (!-pullback). Let f : X →Y be a separated ﬁnitely presented map of quasiexcellent ℓ-

R/mn ≃f !
n(K ⊗bR R/mn).
Proof. Fix K ∈Dcons(Ypro´et, bR), and let Kn = K ⊗R R/mn ∈Dcons(Y´et, R/mn) be its truncation.
Lemma 6.7.18 gives a projective system {f !
nKn} in Dcomp(Xpro´et, bR), and we write f !K := R lim f !
nKn ∈
Dcomp(Xpro´et, bR). By completeness and Lemma 6.7.18, one immediately checks that f !K has the right
adjointness properties. It remains to show f !K ⊗bR R/m ≃f !
1K1, which also implies f !K is constructible.
This follows from the second half of Lemma 6.7.18 and Lemma 3.5.5.
□
Lemma 6.7.20 (Duality). Let X be an excellent ℓ-coprime scheme equipped with a dimension function
δ. Then there exists a dualizing complex ΩX ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR), i.e., if DX := RHomX(−, ΩX), then
id ≃D2
X on Dcons(Xpro´et, bR).
Proof. First consider the case R = Zℓ, and set Rn = Z/ℓn. Then for each n, there exists a unique
(up to unique isomorphism) potential dualising complex ωn ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, Z/ℓn), see [ILO, XVII.2.1.2,
XVII.5.1.1, XVII 6.1.1]. By [ILO, XVII.7.1.3] and uniqueness, one may choose isomorphisms ωn+1⊗Z/ℓn+1
Z/ℓn for each n. Set ωX = lim Ωn ∈D(Xpro´et, c
Zℓ). Then ωX is ℓ-adically complete, and ωX ⊗ZℓZ/ℓn ≃
ωn (by a slight modiﬁcation of Lemma 3.5.5). Lemma 6.7.13 then gives the duality isomorphism id ≃D2
X
in this case by reduction modulo ℓ. For general rings R, set Rn := R/mn, so each Rn is a Z/ℓn-algebra.
Then [ILO, XVII.7.1.3] shows that Ωn := ωn ⊗Z/ℓn Rn ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, Rn) is dualizing. A repeat of
the argument for the previous case then shows that ΩX := lim Ωn ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, bR) has the required
properties.
□
Remark 6.7.21. The dualizing complex constructed in Lemma 6.7.20 is not the traditional dualizing com-
plexes (as in [ILO, §XVII.7]) unless R is Gorenstein. For example, when X is a geometric point, the
dualizing complex above is simply the ring R itself, rather than the dualizing complex ω•
R coming from
local duality theory. This is a reﬂection of our choice of working with a more restrictive class of complexes
in Dcons(Xpro´et, bR): when X is a point, Dcons(X, bR) ≃Dperf(R).
6.8. Zℓ-,Qℓ-,¯Zℓ- and ¯Qℓ-sheaves. Let us start by deﬁning the relevant categories. For the moment, let X
be any scheme.
Deﬁnition 6.8.1. Let E be an algebraic extension of Qℓwith ring of integers OE. Let EX = FE and
OE,X = FOE be the sheaves associated with the topological rings E and OE on Xpro´et as in Lemma 4.2.12.
We ﬁrst identify these sheaves in terms of the familiar algebraic deﬁnitions directly on Xpro´et:
Lemma 6.8.2.
(1) If E is a ﬁnite extension of Qℓwith uniformizer ̟, then OE,X = bOE = limn OE/̟nOE, with
notation as in Subsection 6.5.
58

(2) In general, OE,X = colimF ⊂E OF,X, where F runs through ﬁnite extensions of Qℓcontained in E.
Moreover, EX = OE,X[ℓ−1].
Proof.
(1) This follows from Lemma 4.2.12 and the identity
Mapcont(S, OE) = lim
n Mapcont(S, OE/̟nOE)
for any proﬁnite set S.
(2) This follows from Lemma 4.2.12 and the identities
Mapcont(S, OE) = colim
F ⊂E Mapcont(S, OF ) ,
Mapcont(S, E) = Mapcont(S, OE)[ℓ−1]
for any proﬁnite set S, which result from the compactness of S and Lemma 4.3.7.
□
In this section, we abbreviate E = EX and OE = OE,X if no confusion is likely to arise. First, we deﬁne
lisse E-sheaves.
Deﬁnition 6.8.3. A lisse E-sheaf (or E-local system) is a sheaf L of E-modules on Xpro´et such that L is
locally free of ﬁnite rank. Similarly, a lisse OE-sheaf, or OE-local system, is a sheaf M of OE-modules
on Xpro´et such that M is locally free of ﬁnite rank over OE. Let LocX(E), resp. LocX(OE), be the
corresponding categories.
For any discrete ring R, we also have the category LocX(R) consisting of sheaves of R-modules on
Xpro´et which are locally free of ﬁnite rank over R. In fact, this category is just the classical one deﬁned
using X´et, cf. Corollary 5.1.5. Our ﬁrst aim is to show that our deﬁnitions coincide with the usual deﬁnitions
of lisse sheaves. This amounts to the following proposition.
Proposition 6.8.4.
(1) If E is a ﬁnite extension of Qℓ, with uniformizer ̟, then the functor
M 7→(M/̟nM)n : LocX(OE) →lim
n LocX(OE/̟nOE)
is an equivalence of categories.
(2) For general E, lisse OE-sheaves satisfy descent for pro-´etale covers.
(3) If X is qcqs, the functor
colim
F ⊂E LocX(OF ) →LocX(OE)
is an equivalence of categories, where F runs through ﬁnite extensions of Qℓcontained in E.
(4) If X is qcqs, the functor
M 7→L = M[ℓ−1] : LocX(OE)[ℓ−1] →LocX(E)
is fully faithful.
(5) Lisse E-sheaves satisfy descent for pro-´etale covers.
(6) Let L be a lisse E-sheaf on X. Then there is an ´etale cover Y →X such that L|Y lies in the
essential image of the functor from (4).
Proof.
(1) Easy and left to the reader.
(2) This is clear.
(3) For fully faithfulness, observe that one has obvious internal Hom’s, which are compatible with
extension of scalars. Thus, fully faithfulness follows from the observation that for an OF -local
system MF with base extensions ME, MF ′ for F ′ ⊂E ﬁnite over F, ME = colim MF ′ and
ME(X) = colim MF ′(X) as X is qcqs.
Now ﬁx a qcqs w-contractible cover Y ∈Xpro´et, and describe LocX(OE) in terms of descent
data for Y →X. Any lisse OE-sheaf over Y is necessarily trivial (and hence already deﬁned over
Zℓ), so that the categories of descent data are equivalent by fully faithfulness, using that Y is still
qcqs.
(4) Both categories admit obvious internal Hom’s, which are compatible with the functor M 7→M[ℓ−1].
Thus the result follows from M[ℓ−1](X) = M(X)[ℓ−1], which is true as X is qcqs.
59

(5) This is clear.
(6) Consider the sheaf F on Xpro´et taking any U ∈Xpro´et to the set of M ∈LocU(OE) with M ⊗OE
E = L. We claim that F is locally constant on Xpro´et. To prove this, we can assume that L = En is
trivial. We show more precisely that in this case, F is represented by (the constant sheaf associated
with) the discrete set S = GLn(E)/GLn(OE), via mapping g ∈S to Mg = gOn
E. Clearly, the map
S →F is injective. Let x ∈X be any point. For any M ∈LocX(OE) with M ⊗OE E = L, the
ﬁbre Mx is a OE-lattice in Lx = En. Thus, by applying an element of GLn(E), we may assume
that Mx = On
E. This gives n sections m1,x, . . . , mn,x ∈Mx, which are deﬁned over an open
neighborhood of x; upon replacing X by a neighborhood of x, we may assume that they are (the
images of) global sections m1, . . . , mn ∈M. Similarly, one can assume that there are n sections
m∗
1, . . . , m∗
n ∈M∗= HomOE(M, OE) whose images in M∗
x are the dual basis to m1,x, . . . , mn,x.
This extends to an open neighborhood, so that M = On
E in a neighborhood of x, proving surjectivity
of S →F.
Thus, F is locally constant on Xpro´et. In particular, it is locally classical, and therefore classical
itself by Lemma 5.1.4. As there is a pro-´etale cover Y →X with F(Y ) ̸= ∅, it follows that there is
also an ´etale such cover, ﬁnishing the proof.
□
Corollary 6.8.5. If X is topologically noetherian, then for any morphism f : L →L′ in LocX(E), the
kernel and cokernel of f are again in LocX(E). In particular, LocX(E) is abelian.
Proof. After passage to an ´etale cover, we may assume that there are lisse OE-sheaves M, M′ and a map
g : M →M′ giving rise to f : L →L′ by inverting ℓ. Moreover, we may assume that X is connected; ﬁx a
geometric base point ¯x ∈X. Then LocX(OE) is equivalent to the category of representations of π1(X, ¯x)
on ﬁnite free OE-modules. It follows that f : L →L′ is classiﬁed by a morphism of representations of
π1(X, ¯x) on ﬁnite-dimensional E-vector spaces. The latter category obviously admits kernels and cokernels,
from which one easily deduces the claim.
□
Next, we consider constructible sheaves. For this, we restrict to the case of topologically noetherian
X. Note that the construction of EX is compatible with pullback under locally closed immersions, i.e.
EY = EX|Y for Y ⊂X locally closed. In the topologically noetherian case, any locally closed immersion
is constructible.
Deﬁnition 6.8.6. A sheaf F of E-modules on Xpro´et is called constructible if there exists a ﬁnite stratiﬁca-
tion {Xi →X} such that F|Xi is lisse.
Lemma 6.8.7. For any morphism f : F →F ′ of constructible E-sheaves, the kernel and cokernel of f are
again constructible. In particular, the category of constructible E-sheaves is abelian.
Proof. After passing to a suitable stratiﬁcation, this follows from Corollary 6.8.5.
□
In particular, the following deﬁnition is sensible.
Deﬁnition 6.8.8. A complex K ∈D(Xpro´et, E) is called constructible if it is bounded and all cohomology
sheaves are constructible. Let Dcons(Xpro´et, E) denote the corresponding full subcategory of D(Xpro´et, E).
Corollary 6.8.9. The category Dcons(Xpro´et, E) is triangulated.
Proof. This follows from Lemma 6.8.7, also observing stability of constructibility under extensions.
□
Also recall the full triangulated subcategories Dcons(Xpro´et, OE) ⊂D(Xpro´et, OE) for E/Qℓﬁnite
deﬁned in Subsection 6.5. Under our assumption that X is topologically noetherian, these can be deﬁned
similarly to Dcons(Xpro´et, E), cf. Proposition 6.6.11. More precisely, we have the following proposition.
Deﬁnition 6.8.10. For general E, a constructible OE-sheaf on the topologically noetherian scheme X is
a sheaf C of OE-modules such that there exists a ﬁnite stratiﬁcation {Xi →X} such that C|Xi is locally
isomorphic to Λ ⊗OE OE,X for a ﬁnitely presented OE-module Λ. Let ConsX(OE) be the corresponding
category.
Proposition 6.8.11.
(1) The category of constructible OE-sheaves is closed under kernels, cokernels, and extensions.
60

(2) The functor
colim
F ⊂E ConsX(OF ) →ConsX(OE)
is an equivalence of categories, where F runs through ﬁnite extensions of Qℓ.
(3) If E is a ﬁnite extension of Qℓ, then an object K ∈D(Xpro´et, OE) is constructible if and only if it
is bounded and all cohomology sheaves are constructible.
Proof.
(1) The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 6.8.7.
(2) The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 6.8.4 (3).
(3) By (1), the set D′
cons(Xpro´et, OE) of K ∈D(Xpro´et, OE) which are bounded with all cohomol-
ogy sheaves constructible forms a full triangulated subcategory. To show D′
cons(Xpro´et, OE) ⊂
Dcons(Xpro´et, OE), using that Dcons(Xpro´et, OE) ⊂D(Xpro´et, OE) is a full triangulated subcat-
egory, it sufﬁces to prove that a constructible OE-sheaf C concentrated in degree 0 belongs to
Dcons(Xpro´et, OE).
Passing to a stratiﬁcation, we can assume that C is locally isomorphic to
Λ ⊗OE OE,X for a ﬁnitely presented OE-module Λ. In this case, Λ has a ﬁnite projective reso-
lution, giving the result.
For the converse, we argue by induction on q −p that D[p,q]
cons(Xpro´et, OE) ⊂D′
cons(Xpro´et, OE).
Thus, if K ∈D[p,q]
cons(Xpro´et, OE), it is enough to show that Hq(X) is a constructible OE-sheaf. This
follows easily from Proposition 6.6.11.
□
In particular, for general E, we can deﬁne Dcons(Xpro´et, OE) ⊂D(Xpro´et, OE) as the full triangulated
subcategory of bounded objects whose cohomology sheaves are constructible OE-sheaves.
Lemma 6.8.12. For any K ∈Dcons(Xpro´et, OE), the functor RHom(K, −) commutes with arbitrary direct
sums in D≥0(Xpro´et, OE).
Proof. The proof is the same as for Lemma 6.3.14.
□
Although a lisse E-sheaf does not always admit an integral structure as a lisse OE-sheaf, it does always
admit an integral structure as a constructible OE-sheaf.
Lemma 6.8.13. Let L be a lisse E-sheaf on the topologically noetherian scheme X. Then there exists a
constructible OE-sheaf C such that C ⊗OE E = L.
Proof. First, we prove that there exists a ﬁnite stratiﬁcation {Xi →X} such that L|Xi admits an OE-lattice.
By Proposition 6.8.4 (6), there exists some ´etale cover Y →X such that L|Y admits an OE-lattice. After
passing to a stratiﬁcation on X, we may assume that Y →X is ﬁnite ´etale, and that X is connected; ﬁx a
geometric base point ¯x ∈X with a lift to Y . In that case, L|Y corresponds to a continuous representation
of the proﬁnite fundamental group π1(Y, ¯x) on a ﬁnite-dimensional E-vector space. As Y →X is ﬁnite
´etale, this extends to a continuous representation of the proﬁnite fundamental group π1(X, ¯x) on the same
ﬁnite-dimensional E-vector space. Any such representation admits an invariant OE-lattice (as π1(X, ¯x) is
compact), giving the claim.
In particular, L can be ﬁltered as a constructible E-sheaf by constructible E-sheaves which admit OE-
structures. By Lemma 6.8.12, for two constructible E-sheaves C, C′, one has
Ext1(C[ℓ−1], C′[ℓ−1]) = Ext1(C, C′)[ℓ−1] .
This implies that L itself admits a OE-structure, as desired.
□
The following proposition shows that the triangulated category Dcons(Xpro´et, E) is equivalent to the
triangulated category traditionally called Db
c(X, E).
Proposition 6.8.14.
(1) For general E,
colim
F ⊂E Dcons(Xpro´et, OF ) →Dcons(Xpro´et, OE)
is an equivalence of triangulated categories, where F runs through ﬁnite extensions of Qℓcontained
in E.
61

(2) The functor Dcons(Xpro´et, OE)[ℓ−1] →Dcons(Xpro´et, E) is an equivalence of triangulated cate-
gories.
Note that in part (2), one has an equivalence of categories without having to pass to ´etale covers of X.
Proof.
(1) Lemma 6.8.12 gives full faithfulness. For essential surjectivity, one can thus reduce to the
case of a constructible OE-sheaf. In that case, the result follows from Proposition 6.8.11 (2).
(2) Again, full faithfulness follows from Lemma 6.8.12. For essential surjectivity, one can reduce to the
case of an E-local system L. In that case, the result is given by Lemma 6.8.13.
□
Remark 6.8.15. Let Λ ∈{OE, E}. Under the same assumptions as in §6.7, the 6 functors are deﬁned on
Dcons(Xpro´et, Λ). Note that one can also deﬁne most of the 6 functors on D(Xpro´et, Λ). All schemes are
assumed to be noetherian in the following. There are obvious ⊗, RHom and f∗functors for a morphism
f : Y →X. The functor f∗admits a left adjoint f ∗: D(Xpro´et, Λ) →D(Ypro´et, Λ) given explicitly by
f ∗K = f ∗
naiveK ⊗f∗
naiveΛX ΛY , where f ∗
naive denotes the naive pullback. If f is ´etale or a closed immersion
(or a composition of such), then f ∗
naiveΛX = ΛY , so f ∗K = f ∗
naiveK is the naive pullback. Moreover, one
has the functor j! : D(Upro´et, Λ) →D(Xpro´et, Λ) for an open immersion j : U →X; by composition, one
gets a functor f! for a separated morphism f : Y →X. If f is a closed immersion, f! = f∗admits a right
adjoint f ! : D(Xpro´et, Λ) →D(Ypro´et, Λ), given as the derived functor of sections with support in Y .
It follows from the results of §6.7 and the previous discussion that under the corresponding ﬁniteness as-
sumptions, these functors preserve constructible complexes, and restrict to the 6 functors on Dcons(Xpro´et, Λ).
In particular, one can compute these functors by choosing injective replacements in D(Xpro´et, Λ).

7. THE PRO-´ETALE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP
We study the fundamental group resulting from the category of locally constant sheaves on the pro-´etale
topology, and explain how it overcomes some shortcomings of the classical ´etale fundamental group for
non-normal schemes. The relevant category of sheaves, together with some other geometric incarnations,
is studied in §7.3, while the fundamental group is constructed in §7.4. However, we ﬁrst isolate a class of
topological groups §7.1; this class is large enough to contain the fundamental group we construct, yet tame
enough to be amenable to a formalism of “inﬁnite” Galois theory introduced in §7.2.
7.1. Noohi groups. All topological groups in this section are assumed Hausdorff, unless otherwise speci-
ﬁed. We study the following class of groups, with a view towards constructing the pro-´etale fundamental
group:
Deﬁnition 7.1.1. Fix a topological group G. Let G-Set be the category of discrete sets with a continuous
G-action, and let FG : G-Set →Set be the forgetful functor. We say that G is a Noohi group7 if the natural
map induces an isomorphism G ≃Aut(FG) of topological groups, where Aut(FG) is topologized using
the compact-open topology on Aut(S) for each S ∈Set.
The basic examples of Noohi groups are:
Example 7.1.2. If S is a set, then G := Aut(S) is a Noohi group under the compact-open topology; recall
that a basis of open neighbourhoods of 1 ∈Aut(S) in the compact-open topology is given by the stabilizers
UF ⊂G of ﬁnite subsets F ⊂S. The natural map G →Aut(FG) is trivially injective. For surjectivity, any
φ ∈Aut(FG) induces a φS ∈G as S is naturally a G-set. It is therefore enough to show that any transitive
G-set is a G-equivariant subset of Sn for some n. Any transitive G-set is of the form G/UF for some ﬁnite
subset F ⊂S ﬁnite. For such F, the G-action on the given embedding F ֒→S deﬁnes a G-equivariant
inclusion G/UF →Map(F, S), so the claim follows.
It is often non-trivial to check that a topological group with some “intrinsic” property, such as the property
of being proﬁnite or locally compact, is a Noohi group. To systematically deal with such issues, we relate
Noohi groups to more classical objects in topological group theory: complete groups.
Deﬁnition 7.1.3. For a topological group G, we deﬁne the completion G∗of G as the completion of G for
its two-sided uniformity, and write i : G ֒→G∗for the natural embedding. We say G is complete if i is an
isomorphism.
We refer the reader to [AT08] for more on topological groups, especially [AT08, §3.6] for the existence
and uniqueness of completions. We will show that a topological group is Noohi if and only if it admits
enough open subgroups and is complete. In preparation, we have:
Lemma 7.1.4. For any set S, the group Aut(S) is complete for the compact-open topology.
Proof. Let G := Aut(S), and η be a Cauchy ﬁlter on G for its two-sided uniformity. For each F ⊂S ﬁnite,
the stabilizer UF ⊂G is open, so, by the Cauchy property, we may (and do) ﬁx some HF ∈η such that
HF × HF ⊂{(x, y) ∈G2 | xy−1 ∈UF
and
x−1y ∈UF }.
Fix also some hF ∈HF for each such F. Then the above containment means: h(f) = hF (f) and h−1(f) =
h−1
F (f) for all h ∈HF and f ∈F. If F ⊂F ′, then the ﬁlter property HF ∩HF ′ ̸= ∅implies that
hF ′(f) = hF (f), and h−1
F ′ (f) = h−1
F (f) for all f ∈F. Hence, there exist unique maps φ : S →S and
ψ : S →S such that φ|F = hF |F and ψ|F = h−1
F |F for all ﬁnite subsets F ⊂S. It is then immediate that φ
and ψ are mutually inverse automorphisms, and that the ﬁlter Bφ of open neighbourhoods of φ is equivalent
to η, so η converges to φ, as wanted.
□
The promised characterisation is:
7These groups are called prodiscrete groups in [Noo08]. However, they are not pro-(discrete groups), which seems to be the
common interpretation of this term, so we adapt a different terminology.
63

Proposition 7.1.5. Let G be a topological group with a basis of open neighbourhoods of 1 ∈G given by
open subgroups. Then there is a natural isomorphism Aut(FG) ≃G∗. In particular, G is Noohi if and only
if it is complete.
Proof. Let U be the collection of open subgroups U ⊂G. For U ∈U and g ∈G, we write Tg :
G/(gUg−1) →G/U for the G-equivariant isomorphism α · gUg−1 7→αg · U, i.e., right multiplication
by g.
We ﬁrst construct a natural injective map ψ : Aut(FG) →G∗. Given φ ∈Aut(FG), one obtains induced
automorphisms φU : G/U →G/U for U ∈U. Let gU · U := φU(1 · U) and hU · U := φ−1
U (1 · U)
denote the images of the identity coset 1 · U ⊂G/U under φU and φ−1
U ; here we view a coset of U as a
subset of G. We claim that {gU · U} (indexed by U ∈U) is a ﬁlter base that deﬁnes a Cauchy and shrinking
ﬁlter. The ﬁnite intersection property follows immediately from φ commuting with the projection maps
G/W →G/U for W ⊂U a smaller open subgroup. For the Cauchy property, we must check: given
U ∈U, there exists W ∈U and b ∈G such that gW · W ⊂U · b. Fix an element h ∈G deﬁning the coset
hU · U, and let W = hUh−1 be the displayed conjugate of U. Then one has a G-equivariant isomorphism
Th : G/W →G/U deﬁned in symbols by α · W 7→α · Wh = αh · U, where the last equality is an equality
of subsets of G. The compatibility of φ with Th then shows gW · W · h = φU(h · U) = U, where the last
equality uses φU ◦φ−1
U
= id; setting b = h−1 then gives the Cauchy property. For the shrinking property,
we must show: for each U ∈U, there exist V, W, Y ∈U such that V · gW · W · Y ⊂gU · U; we may simply
take W = Y = U, and V = gUg−1 for some g ∈G lifting the coset gU · U. Let ψ(φ) be the Cauchy
and shrinking ﬁlter associated to {gU · U}, i.e., ψ(φ) is the collection of open subsets Y ⊂G such that
gU · U ⊂Y for some U ∈U. Then ψ(φ) ∈G∗, which deﬁnes a map ψ : Aut(FG) →G∗.
Next, we show that ψ is injective. If φ ∈ker(ψ), then gU · U = U in the notation above. Now pick
some U ∈U and ﬁx some g ∈G. The naturality of φ with respect to Tg : G/(gUg−1) →G/U shows
that φU(g · U) = g · U, which proves that φU = id for all U ∈U. Any S ∈G-Set may be written as
S = ⊔iG/Ui for suitable Ui, so φS = id for all such S, and hence φ = id.
It now sufﬁces to show that Aut(FG) is complete. Recall that the class of complete groups is closed inside
that of all topological groups under products and passage to closed subgroups. We may realize Aut(FG) as
the equalizer of
Q
U∈U Aut(U)
// Q
U,V ∈U
Q
MapG(G/U,G/V ) Map(G/U, G/V ),
with the maps given by precomposition and postcomposition by automorphisms. Hence, Aut(FG) is a
closed subgroup of Q
U∈U Aut(S); as the latter is complete by Lemma 7.1.4, the claim follows.
□
Proposition 7.1.5 leads to an abundance of Noohi groups:
Example 7.1.6. Any locally compact group with a fundamental system of neighbourhoods of 1 given by
open subgroups is a Noohi group. Indeed, any locally compact group is complete. Some important classes
of examples are: (a) proﬁnite groups, and (b) the groups G(E) where E is a local ﬁeld, and G is a ﬁnite
type E-group scheme, and (c) discrete groups.
Perhaps surprisingly, the algebraic closure Qℓof Qℓis also a Noohi group for the colimit topology, in
contrast with the situation for the ℓ-adic topology. In fact, one has:
Example 7.1.7. Fix a prime number ℓ. For any algebraic extension E of a E0 = Qℓ, the group GLn(E)
is a Noohi group under the colimit topology (induced by expressing E as a union of ﬁnite extensions) for
all n. To see this, we ﬁrst show that E is itself Noohi. Choose a tower E0 ⊂E1 ⊂E2 ⊂· · · ⊂E
such that E = colim Ei. Let U be the collection of all open subgroups of OE in the colimit topology. By
Lemma 7.1.8, we must check that OE ≃O∗
E := limU OE/U; here we use that OE is abelian to identify
the completion O∗
E. A coﬁnal collection of open subgroups is of the form Uf, where f : N →N is a
function, and Uf = ⟨ℓf(i)OEi⟩is the group generated in OE by the displayed collection of open subgroups
of each OEi. Choose OEi-linear sections OEi+1 →OEi; in the limit, this gives OEi-linear retractions
ψi : OE →OEi for each i. An element x ∈O∗
E = limU OE/U determines ψi(x) ∈O∗
Ei = OEi. If the
sequence {ψi(x)} is eventually constant (in OE), then there is nothing to show. Otherwise, at the expense
of passing to a coﬁnal set of the Ei’s, we may assume ψi(x) ∈OEi −OEi−1. Then one can choose a strictly
64

increasing sequence {ki} of integers such that ψi(x) ∈OEi but ψi(x) /∈OEi−1 + ℓkiOEi. The association
i 7→ki gives a function f : N →N. Choose some xf ∈OEj for some j representing the image of x in
OE/Uf. Now ψi(x)−ψi(xf) ∈ψi(Uf) for each i. As ψi is OEi-linear and f is strictly increasing, it follows
that ψi(x) ∈OEj + ℓkiOEi for each i > j; this directly contradicts the assumption on ψi(x), proving that
OE is Noohi. To pass from OE to GLn(OE), we use that the exponential exp : ℓc · Mn(OE) →GLn(OE)
(for some c > 0 to avoid convergence issues) is an isomorphism of uniform spaces onto an open subgroup
of the target, where both sides are equipped with the two-sided uniformity associated to open subgroups of
the colimit topology; see, for example, [Sch11, §18] for more on the p-adic exponential for Lie groups.
The following lemma was used above:
Lemma 7.1.8. If a topological group G admits an open Noohi subgroup U, then G is itself Noohi.
Proof. We must show that the natural map G →Aut(FG) is an isomorphism. By considering the action
of both groups on the G-set G/U, it is enough to check that U ≃StabAut(FG)(x) =: H, where x ∈G/U
is the identity coset. For any U-set S, one has an associated G-set IndG
U(S) = (S × G)/ ∼, where the
equivalence relation is (us, g) ∼(s, gu) for any u ∈U, s ∈S, g ∈G, and the G-action is deﬁned by
h · (s, g) = (s, hg) for h ∈G. This construction gives a functor IndG
U : U-Set →G-Set, left adjoint to
the forgetful functor. For any U-set S, there is an obvious map IndG
U(S) →G/U of G-sets deﬁned by the
projection S ×G →G. The ﬁbre of this map over x ∈G/U is the U-set S. In particular, there is an induced
H-action on S. One checks that this gives a continuous map H →Aut(FU) extending the obvious map
U →Aut(FU). Now the essential image of IndG
U generates G-Set under ﬁltered colimits: for any open
subgroup V ⊂U, one has IndG
U(U/V ) = G/V . Thus, H →Aut(FU) is injective. On the other hand, as U
is Noohi, the composite U →H →Aut(FU) is an isomorphism, and hence so is U →H.
□
7.2. Inﬁnite Galois theory. Inﬁnite Galois theory gives conditions on a pair (C, F : C →Set), consisting
of a category C and a functor F, to be equivalent to a pair (G-Set, FG : G-Set →Set) for G a topological
group. Here, an object X ∈C is called connected if it is not empty (i.e., initial), and for every subobject
Y ⊂X (i.e., Y
∼
→Y ×X Y ), either Y is empty or Y = X.
Deﬁnition 7.2.1. An inﬁnite Galois category8 is a pair (C, F : C →Set) satisfying:
(1) C is a category admitting colimits and ﬁnite limits.
(2) Each X ∈C is a disjoint union of connected objects.
(3) C is generated under colimits by a set of connected objects.
(4) F is faithful, conservative, and commutes with colimits and ﬁnite limits.
The fundamental group of (C, F) is the topological group π1(C, F) := Aut(F), topologized by the compact-
open topology on Aut(S) for any S ∈Set.
Example 7.2.2. If G is a Noohi group, then (G-Set, FG) is a Noohi category, and π1(C, F) = G.
However, not all inﬁnite Galois categories arise in this way:
Example 7.2.3. There are coﬁltered inverse systems Gi, i ∈I, of free abelian groups with surjective
transition maps such that the inverse limit G = lim Gi has only one element, cf. [HS54]. One can deﬁne
an inﬁnite Galois category (C, F) as the 2-categorical direct limit of Gi-Set. It is not hard to see that
π1(C, F) = lim Gi, which has only one element, yet F : C →Set is not an equivalence.
This suggests the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 7.2.4. An inﬁnite Galois category (C, F) is tame if for any connected X ∈C, π1(C, F) acts
transitively on F(X).
The main result is:
Theorem 7.2.5. Fix an inﬁnite Galois category (C, F) and a Noohi group G. Then
8A similar deﬁnition is made in [Noo08]. However, the conditions imposed there are too weak: The category of locally proﬁnite
sets with open continuous maps as morphisms satisﬁes all axioms imposed in [Noo08], but does not arise as G-Set for any Noohi
group G. There are even more serious issues, see Example 7.2.3.
65

(1) π1(C, F) is a Noohi group.
(2) There is a natural identiﬁcation of Homcont(G, π1(C, F)) with the groupoid of functors C →G-Set
that commute with the ﬁbre functors.
(3) If (C, F) is tame, then F induces an equivalence C ≃π1(C, F)-Set.
Proof. Fix a set Xi ∈C, i ∈I, of connected generators. As in the proof of Proposition 7.1.5, one gets that
π1(C, F) is the closed subgroup of Q
i Aut(F(Xi)) of those elements compatible with all maps between all
Xi. It follows that π1(C, F) is closed in a Noohi group, and thus a Noohi group itself, proving (1). Also,
part (2) is completely formal.
It remains to prove part (3). As (C, F) is tame, we know that for any connected X ∈C, π1(C, F) acts
transitively on F(X). It follows that the functor C →π1(C, F)-Set preserves connected components. By
interpreting maps f : Y →X in terms of their graph Γf ⊂Y × X, one sees that the functor is fully
faithful. For essential surjectivity, take any open subgroup U ⊂π1(C, F)-Set. As π1(C, F) is closed in
Q
i Aut(F(Xi)), there are ﬁnitely many Xij, with points xj ∈F(Xij), j ∈J, such that U contains the
subgroup U ′ of π1(C, F) ﬁxing all xj. The element π1(C, F)/U ′ ∈π1(C, F)-Set is the image of some
XU′ ∈C, as it can be realized as the connected component of Q
j Xij containing (xj)j. As colimits exist
in C, the quotient XU = XU′/U exists in C. As colimits are preserved by F, it follows that F(XU) =
π1(C, F)/U, as desired.
□
Proposition 7.1.5 is useful to study Noohi groups under limits. Similarly, Theorem 7.2.5 is useful for
studying the behaviour under colimits. For example, one has coproducts:
Example 7.2.6. The category of Noohi groups admits coproducts. Indeed, if G and H are Noohi groups,
then we can deﬁne an inﬁnite Galois category (C, F) as follows: C is the category of triples (S, ρG, ρH)
where S ∈Set, while ρG : G →Aut(S) and ρH : H →Aut(S) are continuous actions on S of G and H
respectively, and F : C →Set is given by (S, ρG, ρH) 7→S. One has an obvious map from the coproduct of
abstract groups G ∗H to π1(C, F), from which one can see that (C, F) is tame. Then G ∗N H := π1(C, F)
is a coproduct of G and H in the category of Noohi groups.
Remark 7.2.7. It may be true that general inﬁnite Galois categories are classiﬁed by certain group objects
G in the pro-category of sets. One has to assume that the underlying pro-set of this group can be chosen to
be strict, i.e. with surjective transition maps. In that case, one can deﬁne G-Set as the category of sets S
equipped with an action of G (i.e., equipped with a map G× S →S in the pro-category of sets that satisﬁes
the usual axioms). It is easy to verify that G-Set forms an inﬁnite Galois category under the strictness
hypothesis. To achieve uniqueness of G, one will again have to impose the condition that there are enough
open subgroups. Fortunately, the inﬁnite Galois categories coming from schemes will be tame, so we do not
worry about such esoteric objects!
7.3. Locally constant sheaves. Fix a scheme X which is locally topologically noetherian. We will consider
the following classes of sheaves on Xpro´et:
Deﬁnition 7.3.1. Fix F ∈Shv(Xpro´et). We say that F is
(1) locally constant if there exists a cover {Xi →X} in Xpro´et with F|Xi constant.
(2) locally weakly constant if there exists a cover {Yi →X} in Xpro´et with Yi qcqs such that F|Yi is
the pullback of a classical sheaf on the proﬁnite set π0(Yi).
(3) a geometric covering if F is an ´etale X-scheme satisfying the valuative criterion of properness.
We write LocX, wLocX and CovX for the corresponding full subcategories of Shv(Xpro´et).
Remark 7.3.2. The objects of LocX, wLocX and CovX are classical. This is evident for CovX, and follows
from Lemma 5.1.4 for LocX and wLocX.
Remark 7.3.3. Any Y ∈CovX is quasiseparated: Y is locally topologically noetherian by Lemma 6.6.10.
Hence, we can write Y as a ﬁltered colimit of its qcqs open subschemes. This remark will be used without
comment in the sequel.
Remark 7.3.4. Fix an F ∈Shv(Xpro´et). One checks that F ∈wLocX if and only if for any qcqs w-
contractible Y ∈Xpro´et, the restriction F|Y is classical, and the pullback of its pushforward to π0(Y ). For
66

such Y , pushforward and pullback along Shv(Y´et) →Shv(π0(Y )´et), as well as the inclusion Shv(Y´et) ⊂
Shv(Ypro´et), commute with all colimits and ﬁnite limits; thus, the subcategory wLocX ⊂Shv(Xpro´et) is
closed under all colimits and ﬁnite limits.
Example 7.3.5. If X = Spec(k) is the spectrum of a ﬁeld, then LocX = wLocX = CovX = Shv(X´et).
Indeed, this is immediate from the observation that any separable closure of k provides a connected w-
contractible cover of X. More generally, the same argument applies to any ﬁnite scheme of Krull dimension
0: the underlying reduced scheme is a ﬁnite product of ﬁelds.
Lemma 7.3.6. If Y is a qcqs scheme, and F ∈Shv(Ypro´et) is the pullback of a classical sheaf on π0(Y ),
then
(1) F is representable by an algebraic space ´etale over Y .
(2) F satisﬁes the valuative criterion for properness.
(3) The diagonal ∆: F →F ×Y F is a ﬁltered colimit of clopen immersions.
Proof. As any classical sheaf on a proﬁnite set is a ﬁltered colimit of ﬁnite locally constant sheaves, so
F = colimi Ui is a ﬁltered colimit of ﬁnite ´etale Y -schemes Ui indexed by a ﬁltered poset I. In particular,
(2) and (3) are clear. (1) follows by expressing F as the quotient of the ´etale equivalence relation on ⊔iUi
given by the two evident maps ⊔i≤jUi →⊔iUi: the identity Ui →Ui and the transition map Ui →Uj.
□
Remark 7.3.7. The algebraic space F in Lemma 7.3.6 need not be quasiseparated over Y . For example, we
could take F to be the pullback of two copies of π0(Y ) glued along a non-quasicompact open subset. This
phenomenon does not occur for the geometric coverings we consider as X is topologically noetherian.
Lemma 7.3.8. If Y is a henselian local scheme, then any F ∈CovX is a disjoint union of ﬁnite ´etale
Y -schemes.
Proof. If Z ⊂Y is the closed point, then F|Z = ⊔iZi with Zi →Z connected ﬁnite ´etale schemes by
Example 7.3.5. Let ˜Zi →Y be the (unique) connected ﬁnite ´etale Y -scheme lifting Zi →Z. Then the
henselian property ensures that F( ˜Zi) = F|Z(Zi), so one ﬁnds a canonical ´etale map φ : ⊔i ˜Zi →F
inducing an isomorphism after restriction to Z. As the image of φ is closed under generalization, and
because each point of F specializes to a point of the special ﬁbre (by half of the valuative criterion), one
checks that φ is surjective. To check φ is an isomorphism, one may assume Y is strictly henselian, so ˜Zi = Y
for each i. Then each ˜Zi →F is an ´etale monomorphism, and hence an open immersion. Moreover, these
open immersions are pairwise disjoint (by the other half of the valuative criterion), i.e., that ˜Zi ∩˜Zj = ∅as
subschemes of F for i ̸= j. Then ⊔i ˜Zi gives a clopen decomposition for F, as wanted.
□
Lemma 7.3.9. One has LocX = wLocX = CovX as subcategories of Shv(Xpro´et).
Proof. The property that a sheaf F ∈Shv(Xpro´et) lies in LocX, wLocX, or CovX is Zariski local on X.
Hence, we may assume X is topologically noetherian. It is clear that LocX ⊂wLocX. For wLocX ⊂
CovX, ﬁx some F ∈wLocX. Lemma 7.3.6 and descent show that F satisﬁes the conclusion of Lemma
7.3.6. To get F to be a scheme, note that F is quasiseparated as X is topologically noetherian, and thus the
diagonal of F is a clopen immersion by quasicompactness. In particular, F is separated, and thus a scheme:
any locally quasiﬁnite and separated algebraic space over X is a scheme, see [Sta, Tag 0417].
We next show CovX ⊂wLocX, i.e., any geometric covering F →X is locally weakly constant. In fact,
it sufﬁces to show the following: for any qcqs U ∈X´et and map φ : U →F, one may, locally on X´et,
factor φ as U →L →F with L ﬁnite locally constant. Indeed, this property implies that F|Y is a ﬁltered
colimit of ﬁnite locally constant sheaves for any w-contractible Y ∈Xpro´et, which is enough for local weak
constancy. As F is a ﬁltered colimit of qcqs open subschemes, this property follows from Lemma 7.3.8 and
spreading out.
It remains to check wLocX = LocX. Choose F ∈wLocX and a qcqs w-contractible cover Y →X such
that F|Y = π∗G for some G ∈Shv(π0(Y )´et), where π : Y →π0(Y ) is the natural map. We must show
that G is locally constant. Let Xη ⊂X be the union of the ﬁnite collection of generic points of X, and write
67

Yη ⊂Y for the corresponding ﬁbre. Let Yη be a qcqs w-contractible cover of Yη. Then we obtain a diagram
Yη

Each connected component of Y is a strict henselisation of X, and thus contains a point lying over a point
of Xη, i.e., a point of Yη. This shows that π0(b) is surjective. The map π0(a) is clearly surjective. Write
f : π0(Yη) →π0(Y ) for the composite surjection. As Y is w-contractible, the space π0(Y ) is extremally
disconnected. Thus, it is enough to show that f ∗G is locally constant. As ψ∗ψ∗≃id as endofunctors of
Shv(π0(Yη)), it is enough to show ψ∗f ∗G is locally constant. By the commutativity of the diagram, the
latter sheaf coincides with the restriction of F to Yη. But Yη is a w-contractible cover of Xη, so the claim
follows from the equality wLocXη = LocXη of Example 7.3.5.
□
Remark 7.3.10. If X is Nagata, one may prove a more precise form of Lemma 7.3.9: there exists a pro-´etale
cover {Ui →X} with Ui connected such that F|Ui is constant for any F ∈wLocX. To see this, choose
a stratiﬁcation {Xi →X} with Xi afﬁne, normal and connected; this is possible as X is Nagata. Let Vi
be the henselisation of X along Xi, and Ui →Vi be a connected pro-(ﬁnite ´etale) cover that splits all ﬁnite
´etale Vi-schemes. Then one checks that {Ui →X} satisﬁes the required properties using the Gabber-Elkik
theorem (which identiﬁes Vi,f´et ≃Xi,f´et), and the observation that each F ∈wLocXi is a disjoint union of
ﬁnite ´etale Xi-schemes by normality.
Remark 7.3.11. For an arbitrary scheme Y , deﬁne LocY , wLocY and CovY as above, except that objects
of wLocY and CovY are required to be quasiseparated. Then the proof of Lemma 7.3.9 shows that one
always has LocY ⊂wLocY = CovY , and the inclusion is an equivalence if Y has locally a ﬁnite number
of irreducible components.
Example 7.3.12. Some topological condition on the scheme X (besides being connected) is necessary
to make coverings well-behaved. Indeed, consider the following example. Let T be topological space
underlying the adic space corresponding to the closed unit disc over Qp. This is a spectral space, so there
is some ring A for which X = SpecA is homeomorphic to T. All arguments in the following are purely
topological, so we will argue on the side of T. The origin 0 ∈T is a closed point which admits no
generalizations, yet T is connected. One has open subsets T1, T1/2, . . . ⊂T, where T1/i is the annulus with
outer radius 1/i and inner radius 1/(i + 1).
The open subset U = T \ {0} ⊂T deﬁnes an object of CovX. Indeed, it is clearly ´etale, and it satisﬁes
the valuative criterion of properness, as 0 does not admit nontrivial generalizations. One can show that U
also deﬁnes an object of wLocX, however it is not hard to see that U does not deﬁne an object of LocX. We
claim that the disjoint union of U with an inﬁnite disjoint union of copies of X belongs to LocX. This will
prove that LocX is not closed under taking connected components, so that it cannot deﬁne an inﬁnite Galois
category.
Consider the pro-´etale cover Y →X which has connected components π0(Y ) = {0, 1, 1/2, 1/3, . . .},
with connected components Y0 = {0}, Y1/i = U1/i; it is easy to see how to build Y as an inverse limit. The
pullback of U to Y is the pullback of the sheaf FU on π0(Y ) concentrated on {1, 1/2, 1/3, . . .}. To show
that the disjoint union of U with an inﬁnite disjoint union of copies of X belongs to LocX, it is enough
to show that the disjoint union of FU with an inﬁnite constant sheaf on π0(Y ) is again an inﬁnite constant
sheaf. This boils down to some easy combinatorics on the proﬁnite set π0(Y ), which we leave to the reader.

7.4. Fundamental groups. In this section, we assume that X is locally topologically noetherian and con-
nected, and we ﬁx a geometric point x of X with evx : LocX →Set being the associated functor F 7→Fx.
Lemma 7.4.1. The pair (LocX, evx) is an inﬁnite Galois category. Moreover, it is tame.
Proof. For the ﬁrst axiom, Remark 7.3.4 shows that wLocX ⊂Shv(Xpro´et) is closed under colimits and ﬁ-
nite limits. For the second axiom, we use CovX. Indeed, any Y ∈CovX is locally topologically noetherian,
so that its connected components are clopen. Any clopen subset of Y deﬁnes another object of CovX. It is a
connected object. Indeed, assume Y ∈CovX is connected as a scheme, and Z →Y is some map in CovX.
The image of Z is open and closed under specializations (by the valuative criterion of properness). As Y
is locally topologically noetherian, open implies locally constructible, and in general, locally constructible
and closed under specializations implies closed. Thus, the image of Z is open and closed, and thus either
empty or all of Y . The third axiom regarding things being a set (as opposed to a proper class) is left to the
reader. For the last axiom, we use LocX. As any pair of points of X is linked by a chain of specializations,
one checks that evx is conservative and faithful on LocX. As evx is given by evaluation on a connected w-
contractible object, it commutes with all colimits and all limits in Shv(Xpro´et), and hence with all colimits
and ﬁnite limits in LocX.
Finally, we have to prove tameness. This comes down to showing that π1 is large enough, i.e. we have to
construct enough paths in X. Thus, choose some connected cover Y →X, and any two geometric points
y1, y2 above x. They give rise to topological points ¯y1, ¯y2 ∈Y . As Y is locally topologically noetherian, we
can ﬁnd a paths ¯y1 = ¯z0, ¯z1, . . . , ¯zn = ¯y2 of points in Y such that for each i = 0, . . . , n −1, ¯zi+1 is either
a specialization or a generalization of ¯zi. Fix geometric points zi above ¯zi. By projection, we get geometric
points xi of X, lying above topological points ¯xi ∈X.
For each i, choose a valuation ring Ri with algebraically closed fraction ﬁeld, together with a map
SpecRi →Y such that the special and generic point are (isomorphic to) zi and zi+1 (or the other way
around); we ﬁx the isomorphisms. The valuation rings Ri induce maps SpecRi →X, which induce iso-
morphisms of ﬁbre functors evxi ≃evxi+1. By composition, we get an isomorphism of ﬁbre functors
evx = evx0 ≃evx1 ≃. . . ≃evxn = evx ,
i.e. an automorphism γ ∈π1(LocX, evx) of the ﬁbre functor evx. By construction, we have γ(y1) = y2,
showing that (LocX, evx) is tame.
□
Tameness implies that the following deﬁnition is robust:
Deﬁnition 7.4.2. The pro-´etale fundamental group is deﬁned as πpro´et
1
(X, x) := Aut(evx); this group is
topologized using the compact-open topology on Aut(S) for any S ∈Set.
We now relate πpro´et
1
(X,x) to other fundamental groups. First, the proﬁnite completion of πpro´et
1
(X, x)
recovers the ´etale fundamental group π´et
1 (X, x), as deﬁned in [SGA71]:
Lemma 7.4.3. Let G be a proﬁnite group. There is an equivalence
Homcont(πpro´et
1
(X, x), G) ≃(BFG)(Xpro´et) .
Here, Hom(H, G) for groups G and H denotes the groupoid of maps H →G, where maps between
f1, f2 : H →G are given by elements g ∈G conjugating f1 into f2.
Proof. Both sides are compatible with coﬁltered limits in G, so we reduce to G ﬁnite. In this case, one
easily checks that both sides classify G-torsors on Xpro´et.
□
To understand representations of πpro´et
1
(X, x), we ﬁrst construct “enough” objects in LocX.
Construction 7.4.4. The equivalence CovX ≃LocX ≃πpro´et
1
(X, x)-Set implies that for each open sub-
group U ⊂πpro´et
1
(X, x), there exists a canonically deﬁned XU ∈CovX with a lift of the base point
x ∈XU,pro´et corresponding to πpro´et
1
(X, x)/U ∈πpro´et
1
(X, x)-Set in a base point preserving manner.
Moreover, as XU is itself a locally topologically noetherian scheme, one has πpro´et
1
(XU, x) = U as sub-
groups of πpro´et
1
(X, x).
69

Write LocX´et for the category of locally constant sheaves on X´et, viewed as a full subcategory of LocX.
The difference between LocX´et and LocX can be explained group theoretically:
Lemma 7.4.5. Under LocX ≃πpro´et
1
(X, x)-Set, the full subcategory LocX´et ⊂LocX corresponds to the
full subcategory of those S ∈πpro´et
1
(X, x)-Set where an open subgroup acts trivially.
Proof. Fix S ∈πpro´et
1
(X, x)-Set, and assume an open subgroup U ⊂πpro´et
1
(X, x) acts trivially on S.
Then the corresponding locally constant sheaf is trivialized by passage to XU, which is an ´etale cover of
X. Conversely, ﬁx some F ∈LocX´et with ﬁbre S, and consider the sheaf G = Isom(F, S) on Xpro´et.
The ´etale local trivializability of F shows that G is an Aut(S)-torsor on X´et; here we use that Aut(S) =
Aut(S) = ν∗FAut(S) on X´et as each U ∈X´et has a discrete π0. Then G ∈CovX, so there exists an
open subgroup U ⊂πpro´et
1
(X, x) and a factorization XU →G →X. By construction, F|G is constant, so
U = πpro´et
1
(XU, x) acts trivially on the ﬁbre Fx.
□
The pro-(discrete group) completion of πpro´et
1
(X, x) covers the fundamental pro-group deﬁned in [Gro64,
§6]:
Lemma 7.4.6. Let G be a discrete group. There is an equivalence
Homcont(πpro´et
1
(X, x), G) ≃(BG)(X´et) .
Proof. Any continuous map ρ : πpro´et
1
(X, x) →G gives a G-torsor in πpro´et
1
(X, x)-Set, and hence an object
of (BG)(Xpro´et); one then simply observes that (BG)(Xpro´et) = (BG)(X´et) as G is discrete. Conversely,
any G-torsor F on X´et deﬁnes a ﬁbre preserving functor G-Set →LocX simply by pushout, and hence
comes from a continuous map πpro´et
1
(X, x) →G.
□
Lemma 7.4.6 shows that the inverse limit of the pro-group deﬁned in [Gro64, §6] is large enough, i.e., the
limit topological group has the same discrete group representations as the deﬁning pro-group.
We now explain why the group πpro´et
1
(X, x) is richer than its pro-(discrete group) completion: the latter
does not know the entirety of LocX(Qℓ) (see Example 7.4.9), while the former does. The main issue is
that LocX(Qℓ) is not LocX(Zℓ)[1
ℓ], but rather the global sections of the stack associated to the prestack
U 7→LocU(Zℓ)[1
ℓ] on Xpro´et.
Lemma 7.4.7. For a local ﬁeld E, there is an equivalence of categories RepE,cont(πpro´et
1
(X, x)) ≃LocX(E).
Proof. The claim is clear if E is replaced by OE as GLn(OE) is proﬁnite.
Now given a continuous
representation ρ : πpro´et
1
(X, x) →GLn(E), the group U = ρ−1GLn(OE) is open in πpro´et
1
(X, x),
and hence deﬁnes a pointed covering XU →X with πpro´et
1
(XU, x) = U.
The induced representa-
tion πpro´et
1
(XU, x) →GLn(OE) deﬁnes some M ∈LocXU (OE), and hence an M′ ∈LocXU (E);
one checks that M′ comes equipped with descent data for XU →X, and hence comes from a unique
N(ρ) ∈LocX(E). Conversely, ﬁx some N ∈LocX(E), viewed as an FGLn(E)-torsor for suitable n. For
each S ∈GLn(E)-Set, one has an induced representation ρS : FGLn(E) →FAut(S). The pushout of N
along ρS deﬁnes an NS ∈LocX with stalk S. This construction gives a functor GLn(E)-Set →LocX
which is visibly compatible with the ﬁbre functor. As GLn(E) is Noohi, one obtains by Galois theory the
desired continuous homomorphism ρN : πpro´et
1
(X, x) →GLn(E).
□
Remark 7.4.8. By Example 7.1.7, the conclusion of Lemma 7.4.7 also applies to any algebraic extension
E/Qℓwith the same proof.
The following example is due to Deligne:
Example 7.4.9. Let Y be a smooth projective curve of genus ≥1 over an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Fix
three distinct points a, b, x ∈Y , and paths eva ≃evx ≃evb between the corresponding ﬁbre functors
on LocY . Let X = Y/{a, b} be the nodal curve obtained by identifying a and b on Y ; set π : Y →X
for the natural map, and c = π(a) = π(b). Then one has two resulting paths evx ≃evc as ﬁbre functors
on LocX, and hence an element λ ∈πpro´et
1
(X, x) corresponding to the loop. Fix a local ﬁeld E, a rank
n local system M ∈LocY (E) with monodromy group GLn(OE) with n ≥2, and a generic non-integral
70

matrix T ∈GLn(E). Then identifying the ﬁbres Ma and Mb using T (using the chosen paths) gives a
local system M ∈LocX(E) where λ acts by T; a similar glueing construction applies to local systems
of sets, and shows πpro´et
1
(X, x) ≃πpro´et
1
(Y, y) ∗N λZ in the notation of Example 7.2.6. In particular, the
monodromy group of L is GLn(E). Assume that the corresponding continuous surjective representation
ρ : πpro´et
1
(X, x) →GLn(E) factors through the pro-(discrete group) completion of πpro´et
1
(X, x), i.e., the
preimage of each open subgroup W ⊂GLn(E) contains an open normal subgroup of πpro´et
1
(X, x). Then
U := ρ−1(GLn(OE)) is open, so it contains an open normal V ⊂U. By surjectivity, the image ρ(V ) is
a closed normal subgroup of GLn(E) lying in GLn(OE). One then checks that ρ(V ) ⊂Gm(OE), where
Gm ⊂GLn is the center. In particular, the induced representation πpro´et
1
(X, x) →PGLn(E) factors
through a discrete quotient of the source. It follows that L has abelian monodromy over an ´etale cover of
X, which is clearly false: the corresponding statement fails for M over Y by assumption.
Example 7.4.9 is non-normal. This is necessary:
Lemma 7.4.10. If X is geometrically unibranch, then πpro´et
1
(X, x) ≃π´et
1 (X, x).
Proof. One ﬁrst checks that irreducible components are clopen in any locally topologically noetherian ge-
ometrically unibranch scheme: closedness is clear, while the openness is local, and may be deduced by a
specialization argument using the ﬁniteness of generic points on a topologically noetherian scheme. It fol-
lows by connectedness that X is irreducible. Moreover, by the same reasoning, any connected Y ∈CovX is
also irreducible. Let η ∈X be the generic point, and let Yη →η be the generic ﬁbre. Then Yη is connected
by irreducibility of Y , and hence a ﬁnite scheme as Locη is the category of disjoint unions of ﬁnite ´etale
covers of η. In particular, π : Y →X has ﬁnite ﬁbres. We claim that π is ﬁnite ´etale; this is enough for the
lemma as π´et
1 (X, x) classiﬁes ﬁnite ´etale covers of X. For the proof, we may assume X quasicompact. Now
any quasicompact open U ⊂Y containing Yη is ﬁnite ´etale over a quasicompact open V ⊂X, and hence
includes all points over V . Expanding U to include the ﬁbre over some point in the complement of V and
proceeding inductively (using that X is topologically noetherian) then shows that Y is itself quasicompact.
Then π is proper and ´etale, whence ﬁnite ´etale.

Remark 7.4.11. The fundamental group πdJ
1 (X, x) for rigid-analytic spaces over a non-archimedean valued
ﬁeld constructed by de Jong [dJ95] has some similarities with the group πpro´et
1
(X, x) introduced above. In
fact, in the language of our paper, the category CovdJ
X of disjoint unions of “coverings” in the sense of [dJ95,
Deﬁnition 2.1] is a tame inﬁnite Galois category by [dJ95, Theorem 2.10]. Thus, the corresponding group
πdJ
1 (X, x) is a Noohi group; by [dJ95, Theorem 4.2], the category of continuous ﬁnite dimensional Qℓ-
representations of πdJ
1 (X, x) recovers the category of lisse Qℓ-sheaves (and the same argument also applies
to Qℓ-sheaves by Example 7.1.7). However, it is not true that a naive analogue of CovdJ
X for schemes
reproduces the category CovX used above: the latter is larger. Note, moreover, that [dJ95, Lemma 2.7] is
incorrect: the right hand side is a monoid, but need not be a group. As far as we can tell, this does not affect
the rest of [dJ95].
The following deﬁnition is due to Gabber:
Remark 7.4.12. Assume Y is a connected scheme with locally a ﬁnite number of irreducible components.
Then one may deﬁne the weak fundamental groupoid wπ(Y ) as the groupoid-completion of the category
of points of Y´et (which is equivalent to the category of connected w-contractible objects in Ypro´et). For
each such point y ∈wπ(Y ), one has a corresponding automorphism group wπ(Y, y); as Y is connected,
the resulting functor B(wπ(Y, y)) →wπ(Y ) is an equivalence. One can think of elements of wπ(Y, y) as
paths (of geometric points) in Y , modulo homotopy.
Note that the deﬁnition of πpro´et
1
(Y, y) works in this generality, cf. Remark 7.3.11. Moreover, each
F ∈LocY restricts to functor wπ(Y ) →Set, so the ﬁbre evy(F) has a canonical wπ(Y, y)-action. This
construction gives a map wπ(Y, y) →πpro´et
1
(Y, y); by the proof of Lemma 7.4.1, this map has dense image.
If we equip wπ(Y, y) with the induced topology, then continuous maps from πpro´et
1
(Y, y) to Noohi groups G
are the same as continuous maps from wπ(Y, y) to G. In particular, one can describe lisse Qℓ- (resp. Qℓ-)
sheaves in terms of continuous representations of wπ(Y, y) on ﬁnite-dimensional Qℓ- (resp. Qℓ-) vector
spaces.
