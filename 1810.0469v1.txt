Abstract 
 
I want to propose to your attention a mechanic model for the photon. In modern physics scenery 
directed towards a great unification and an omni-inclusive mathematical description of the whole 
Universe, I think, perhaps, it needs again deepening discrete aspects of the reality. Fascinated by the 
photon, I thought necessary to find a photon model of its fine structure, to explain all its properties. 
I saw with great amazement, the energy equation of the photon 
ν
h
E ph =
, and imaging my emotion 
caused by a mysterious structure hidden in the photon, I began working to try to discover this 
elusive structure, to explain deeply the photon linear relationship between energy and frequency, 
                                                
Note: the figures in the pages 1 and 3, which are the same, represent, schematically, a photon in our model; inside the 
double helix, the sinusoidal curve plotted corresponds to the classical, often symbolic, representation of the photon.

confident that this new model could have opened to me a new road to explain h, Planck constant, 
and with it some aspects of quantum physics again dogmatic or obscure. After several years of 
solitary and independent studies and researches, I have the pleasure to present you my ideas and 
their mathematics supports. I thank my colleagues, physicists, mathematicians, professors and the 
other friends, who, after having read this my paper, enthusiastic, suggested me to publish it, to 
publish, what they call “Caroppo’s Photon Model”, in this scientific article. 
 
The descriptions of our model will be made in an inertial frame of reference. In our photon model, 
photon energy, and then its relativistic mass, we think, is divided to half between two sub-particles, 
separated in space, having opposite elementary charges. It is respected the electrical neutrality of 
the real photon, but the hypothesis of a discrete distribution of charges in it, gives us a way to 
understand how it is possible for the photon to carry the electromagnetic field and then, to generate 
the elementary electromagnetic quantum wave impulse. The two semi-photon particles of our 
photon model are in a dynamic equilibrium, which gives stability to the system during its 
propagation, creating between them a dynamic bond. In this new point of view, the generation of a 
matter-antimatter pair, generally electron-positron, from a photon, appears as a phenomenon 
implicating a breaking of the dynamic bond of the two sub-particles constituting the photon, 
revealing the presence in it of two particles with the same energy-mass, and with opposite 
elementary charges. In this heuristic photon structure, the two sub-particles, imagined punctiform, 
material points (at least in a first approximation), move themselves in a precise roto-translation 
motion along two helicoidal trajectories, two coaxial cylindrical helixes with the same step and 
screwing direction, and opposite between them, that is out of phase of π rad.   In each moment the 
two semi-photon particles are on the same plane orthogonal to the common axis of the helixes, with 
the same distance between them, a distance equal to the common diameter of both helixes; the two 
photon sub-particles form, therefore, a dichotomic rigid system, an electric dipole in which the 
same photon would consist. The screwing angle of these helixes is 
°
45 ; the two semi-particles 
move themselves with a total velocity of magnitude 
c
2 ; hence, they rotate with a speed c, and 
they translate with an identical speed c, the speed of light, in the direction of the helix axis, 
therefore the photon system translates globally, along helix axis with an uniform straight line 
movement, of c speed, perfectly like in a real photon. The two sub-particles are tachyons; they have 
a superluminal speed, but their total velocity magnitude, 
c
2 , reveals some interesting mathematic 
properties in special relativity equations.  
Radius of the helixes is such that in the time of a complete rotation, of 2π rad, the photon system 
translates of λ, the wavelength of the real photon of the same energy; λ is the common step of both 
helixes. The inverse of the time of a complete rotation, the frequency, ν, of the rotation movement, 
is then, the frequency of the photon. Now, in the time of a complete rotation, which is the time of  a 
translation of the system of a wavelength, λ, effectively we have a complete rotation-fluctuation of 
the electric and magnetic fields of our photon model, and therefore of its associated and by it 
generated, electromagnetic wave! Therefore, by our model, we give a more defined description of λ 
and ν , wave properties of the photonic particle, that, here, we bring back to the intrinsic kinematics 
of the photon fine structure; a result which can recompose the traditional “wave-corpuscle dualism” 
in the phenomenological behaviour of the electromagnetic radiation, without the necessity of a 
dogmatic principle of dualism for it. 
This photon system, as described, has a momentum which is the same of a real photon with the 
same energy; identical magnitude and identical momentum direction, that of the translation motion 
of our system, hence of the real photon we want to describe structurally here. Our system has a spin 
which is exactly, that of the real photon, also with one xor the other of the two possible right-
handed and left-handed screwing directions, corresponding respectively, to a vector spin parallel

xor anti-parallel with the translation direction. Magnetic momentum of spin is null as in the real 
photon, too. Also, the total rest mass of our photonic system, which is zero, is the same of the real 
photon. More, we find in our model a three-dimensional photon, non punctiform, with a transversal 
radius linearly proportional to λ, and of the same magnitude, exactly as diffraction experiments 
suggest us for the real photons; however, λ, which is traditionally a longitudinal property, does not 
lose here, this longitudinal aspect! 
The magnetic Lorentz forces between the opposite charges in motion of the two semi-photon 
particles are null in our described system.  
The dynamic stability of Caroppo’s Photon Model, with the relativistic formula of Newton's second 
law of motion, considering the electric Coulomb force between the two photon sub-particles, gives 
us a surprising result, proper the equation of a linear relationship between photon energy and its 
frequency, as obtained in the studies of Planck and Einstein, and as verified after, in many other 
experiments!  
The discussion about the proportional constant of this equation, which must be equalled to the 
experimental Planck constant, h, gives us the opportunity to present a new interpretation of h. We 
find 
π
c
e
K
h
SV

=
, where 
SV
K
 is the magnitude of Coulomb’s constant, in Coulomb’s electrostatic 
interaction between the charges of the two superluminal photon sub-particles. If K  is traditional 
Coulomb’s constant in the vacuum, we have 
K
K SV >
 . We attribute the greater magnitude of 
SV
K
, 
to the inertia of the vacuum, a dielectric inertia, that is the intrinsic inertia of the charged particles of 
the vacuum, “virtual” particles called according to modern physics; particles connected to the 
intrinsic energy of the empty space. For their inertia, we think they can not respond to the too much 
variation in space and time of the electric field connected with the superluminal passage of the 
internal charges of the photon, so the charges of the photon sub-particles are not screened, and they 
travel in a vacuum not polarized, while ever it is polarized for the electric interaction between 
charges in subluminal speed. This could also explain the nature of the origin of the “Fine Structure 
Constant”! The analyses of the electric and magnetic dynamic fields of our photon system, (that is 
of the elementary electromagnetic quantum wave impulse), generated by its constituting two 
opposite charges in motion, show exactly, in particular important straight lines, the same 
characteristics as orthogonalities, circular polarizations, time and space variations of their Cartesian 
components, which we find in the plane monochromatic electromagnetic wave in Maxwell’s 
theory!  
A theoretical model so potent that can not be ignored, although it takes us towards new 
revolutionary prospectives of looking at nature, certainly ever joinable with our previous scientific 
conquests as the history of science suggests! 
 
 
 
Prolegomenon 
 
In this article I propose a possible model to describe photon structure. The necessity of  this model 
is born to understand the phenomenological photon characteristics and to solve some aspects of the 
quantum physics which have until now a dogmatic nature and which are covered by an intellectual  
fog. A photon model so astonishing that gives us the possibility to obtain the important equation  
ν
h
E ph =
, by electric and dynamic intrinsic aspects of the fine structure of the photon!

Synopsis 
 
Initially, an abstract of the work, then a little prolegomenon to it. It follows a resume about the main 
properties of the photon. Then, we became to expound a possible microstructure for the photon,  
“Caroppo’s Photon Model”, the double-helix in the fine photon structure. At the beginning, a 
description of the fine constituents of this model, it follows a presentation of its geometric and 
kinematic aspects. Hence, we show how kinematic and geometric properties can give raison of the 
photon frequency, ν, which appears, here, a physical property intrinsic in our photon dynamic 
structure. The model gives substantiality to the phenomenological finite not null transversal 
dimensions of the photon. According photon spin with our model, we can find physical reason to its 
intrinsic angular moment. We define better the internal kinematics, to accord it with the real 
movement characteristics of the photon, we calculate the screwing angle of the helical trajectories, 
and we demonstrate the accord between theory and physics about magnetic momentum of spin too. 
Then, we show as our model has the same momentum and rest mass of a real photon of the same 
total energy. Some considerations about energy and momentum conservation. A focus about the 
real photon spatial dimensions explained in our model. From considerations about the stability of 
our dynamic photonic system, we show that our model predicts a linear relationship between the 
total photon energy and its frequency! Following, we will return to analyse deeply this very 
important result, in accord with experimental  measurements. Considerations about the generation 
of a photon. An exposition  about  the idealizations in our photonic theoretical model and some 
calculations about the inside gravitational interaction in it. Considerations about the microscopical 
tachyon nature of the photon in our model and about this as a not radiative accelerated dipolar 
system. A deep analysis about “Planck constant” to the light of our photonic model and about “Fine 
Structure Constant”. Considerations about photons in the electromagnetic radiation, and about the 
solution of the dogmatic “wave-corpuscle dualism” of light. Perspectives of investigation opened. 
Some considerations about electric and magnetic fields of a photon showing important similitude 
between electromagnetic wave impulse, here predicted and described for the photon, and Maxwell’s 
electromagnetic wave. Conclusion. 
 
 
 
 
 
The Phenomenological Photon Characteristics 
 
We list some photon properties; following we will explain and we will understand better them in 
our photon model. 
 
 
• Photon is a particle associated to the electro-magnetic wave (e.m.w.); photon carries the 
electromagnetic field of the radiation wave, and we can say, a photon is an electro-magnetic 
wave, in particular its quantum wave impulse and an electro-magnetic wave is the photon of a 
group of photons. Photon is the quantum, the basic unit, of the e.m. radiant energy. Then if λ is

the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave associated to a photon, and ν its frequency , these 
are photon properties too. 
 
 
• Photon, like its associated electromagnetic wave, moves itself along a precise straight line, and 
direction, (this in absence of gravitational field), with a constant speed of translation c in 
vacuum, where c is the light speed in the empty space.  
 
 
• It is ever valid  in the empty space this relation: 
 
λν
=
c
                                                                      (1) 
 
 
• We know by experiments, as photoelectric effect and its Einstein’s interpretation, and by 
theoretic studies, as Planck’s resolution of black-body emission problem, that photon connected 
which an electromagnetic wave of frequency  ν, has a total energy  E, proportional to ν, with 
Planck constant, h, as proportional coefficient:    
 
ν
h
E ph =
                                                                   (2) 
 
In this equation the profound sense of Planck constant is hidden! Quantum physics is founded 
on h. 
A structure for the photon that explains its equation, 
ν
h
E ph =
, will give us the possibility to 
understand the physics sense and the real nature of h. 
 
Photon carries energy, and this can explain the energy transported by the electromagnetic wave, 
which is made by one or more photons. 
 
Being 
ν
λ *
=
c
, substituting, we have 
 
λ
hc
E ph =
                                                                  (3) 
 
Then, photon energy is a function of λ, too! 
 
Note: all photons, that exist or that are generated in the Universe, have not the same energy, or a 
discontinuous set of values of energy, a set of limited or unlimited numbers of energy levels, but 
they can have any value of energy (and thus of frequency) within the "electromagnetic 
spectrum", which is a large continuous range of energy values. Thus the different photons can 
have energy values that may differ among them with continuity in the range of energy values of 
the electromagnetic spectrum. Obviously, more photons, with the same energy, can exist, or can 
be generated!  
 
• Photon has a quantum spin number, S, +1 xor -1, and its magnetic momentum of spin, µ is null.  
The photon spin is a longitudinal property of the photon since it can be parallel (S = +1) xor 
antiparallel (S = -1), with the photon velocity direction. Independently of its frequency the spin 

                                                                                                                                 Oreste Caroppo

Photon carries momentum too, and this can explain the momentum also transported by the 
electromagnetic wave, which is made by one or more photons. 
 
 
• Photons interaction, as diffraction, happens like photon occupies a sphere in space whose 
diameter is proportional to λ, and of the same order of magnitude, then like photon has a circular 
section orthogonal to its translation direction, of a diameter proportional to λ , and of the same 
order of magnitude. 
o When the maximum length, D, of an object orthogonally to the photon (or e.m.wave) 
velocity direction, is : 
λ

D
, no significant influence is made on the photon (or 
e.m.wave). 
o When the maximum length, D, of an object orthogonally to the photon (or e.m.wave) 
velocity direction, is : 
λ
≈
D
, the interaction with photon (or e.m.w.) becomes evident. 
 
• Another photon characteristic is that it is an electrically neutral particle. 
 
• In particular condition a photon can transform itself into a pair of particles of matter and 
antimatter, (particle-antiparticle pair), each one with the same rest mass equal or minor to the 
half of the relativistic mass of the original photon, and with opposite elementary electric charge, 
e , complying with the principles of conservation of mass-energy and of charge, in the photon 
transformation into a matter-antimatter pair, generally of an electron and a positron (anti-
electron). 
 
Note that all our considerations, here and after, about a photon model and about photon properties 
are done, in this first exposition, considering a photon propagation in empty space, and describing

A Possible Microstructure For The Photon 
  
“Caroppo’s Photon Model” 
 
The Double-Helix In The Fine Photon Structure 
“La via corretta è spesso la più semplice!” 
 (Oreste Caroppo) 
 
Figure 1: a schematic representation of a photon in our model. 
 
 
Let us take a generic photon with a total energy 
ph

_
. 
We know that a photon in particular condition can transform itself in a couple of particles of matter 
and antimatter with opposite elementary charges, according to the principle of conservation of 
charge, being photon a neutral particle, or system.  
In addition, we know photon is the carrying particle of the electromagnetic field, then it is logical 
thinking that the fluctuations of the electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave 
(e.m.w.), and the same electric field (e.f.) and magnetic field (m.f.) of the wave, are generated by 
the same photon and by its motion, and they are connected to an its more fine microstructure, 
mysterious and never explored or even supposed, until now! 
These and other photon characteristics, furthermore, ask a model for the photon which explains 
them organically.       
 
On the base of this observation, in our photonic model, we image, the photon, classically a 
“particle”, not like a single elementary indivisible particle, but like a particular system dynamically 
stable of two constituents, two more fine particles, two sub-particles, that we call “semi-photon 
particles”. We indicate them, P+ and P-, or respectively, ph+ and ph-, too.

In this first and simple dichotomous photon model, we consider P+ and P-, as punctiform particles, 
two perfect material points, with their mass and charge confined in each time into a null volume in 
their respective Euclidian space-time position point.  
 
We think P+ and P- separated in space by a finite not null distance; we indicate it with r,

We image each semi-photon particle has an elementary charge, (the charge of the electron), e in 
absolute value, but of opposite sign.  
Conventionally, we call P+ the photon sub-particle with charge +e, and we call P- the photon sub-
particle with charge –e; respectively

Hence, we think the charges only revealed and not generated during the production of matter-
antimatter pairs, (particle-antiparticle pairs), by and from a photon, though theoretically it is a 
possible process to generate opposite charges from vacuum, since this respects the conservation 
principle of the total charge of the Universe. 
 
We remember here, that charge is relativistically invariant; its magnitude is constant for every 
velocity of the particle which carries it!  
 
In this way the total electric charge of the photon, the photon system in this model, is zero,

in perfect coherence with empirical observations, in which photon appears electrically neutral; 
really according to our point of view, photon is totally neutral but with a microscopic discrete 
charge distribution of null sum. This distribution is necessary to generate a mobile electric dipole 
system which explains us the electric and magnetic fluctuated fields that a photon carries in its wave 
impulse during its propagation. 
 
Instead, in the general modern physics thought, usually photon is considered as a particle null in 
charge, since in it, there is no charge.    
 
Not only, the null magnitude in photon of its magnetic momentum of spin, takes us in error; in 
addition, it makes us thinking photon without a charge distribution of null charge sum; instead, we 
will show our model is compatible also with a discrete charge distribution of zero charge sum and 
with a null magnetic momentum of spin!

The relativistic mass of a body, or of a system, is the total quantity of energy in it (divided by the 
constant quantity c2), therefore except for the physical unit, relativistic mass is a synonymous of 
total energy.  
 
For the photon relativistic mass, we have:

The total energy of a composite system can be determined by adding together the values of the 
energy of its components.  
Hence, in our photon system total energy is equal to the sum of the total energy of P+ and P-.

The relativistic mass, is linearly proportional to energy, so conservation of energy means relativistic 
mass is conserved.  
We show that in the ideal conditions a photon is an isolated system that does not exchange energy 
with the environment, conserving therefore, its energy and its relativistic mass, as normally it 
happens during the propagation of a photon in vacuum without any external perturbations!

Now, we observe that in diffraction and in other phenomenons, an electromagnetic wave, like a 
single photon, shows us an interaction with objects, which depends of a sort of a spatial transversal 
dimension not null; photon appears like a sphere whose diameter is linearly proportional to the 
wavelength associated to it, and of the same order of magnitude, apart the intuitively think of any 
microscopical particle as a sphere, really in phenomenons, a photon shows us it occupies in space a 
surface orthogonal to its velocity direction, whose dimension, diameter, is linearly proportional to 
the wavelength, and of the same order of magnitude; nonetheless, in the general modern physics 
thought photon is considered often, as a punctiform particle, that is with a null intrinsic volume! 
 
Not only, we observe that : 
 
• when the maximum length, D, of an object orthogonally to the photon (or e.m.wave) 
velocity direction, is : 
λ
<<
D
, no significant influence is made on the photon (or 
e.m.w.); 
• when the maximum length, D, of an object orthogonally to the photon (or e.m.wave) 
velocity direction, is : 
λ
≈
D
, the interaction with photon (or e.m.w.) becomes evident. 
 
This sort of photonic disk structure, orthogonal to photon velocity direction, appears therefore, 
practically total empty, like the positions of photon matter constituents, were distributed  only on 
the borderline circumference of this disk, whose diameter is linearly proportional to λ and of the 
same order of magnitude.  
It is a possible qualitatively model to explain this photon interaction properties. 
 
These aspects oriented me toward my mathematical quantitative photonic model.  
My basic question was “how it is possible, that in a photon its interactions with objects, are 
connected with a sort of its transversal property linearly connected with e.m. wavelength, which is 
classically only a longitudinal property of photon and e.m. wave?”. Longitudinal and transversal 
according to photon velocity direction, which is the direction of propagation of the associated e.m. 
wave.  
 
In addition, the existence of a photon spin not null, suggests us the idea of a three-dimensional, not 
punctiform, structure for the photon; not only, the spin vector has a direction parallel xor 
antiparallel with the direction of photon propagation; these aspects give more strength to the reality 
of a distribution of parties of the mass of the photon in the space in a surface, a sort of disk, 
orthogonal to its translation direction. 
 
We image a structure for the photon which can resume all its exposed properties. 
  
Called z-axis the classical translation straight line of the real photon, here in analysis, with its 
positive direction coincident with the direction of the photon movement, we image that the two 
semi-photon particles P+ and P- , constituting it in our model, move themselves around this axis, 
describing in time two coaxial helicoidal trajectories with the same step and screwing direction, and 
opposite, that is between them out of phase of  π .

They are cylindrical helixes with the same helix radius, R = r/2, kinematically described by the two 
material points, P+ and P-, with the same velocities of translation along z, 
tr
V , and with the same in 
magnitude but opposite in direction velocities of rotation around it, 
tg
V . Kinematic aspects we will 
expound accurately. 
 
The cylindrical helix can be kinematically described 
as the path of a material point which rotates 
describing a circumference in a σ-plane with an 
uniform circular movement, in our case of radius R = 
r/2, and whose plane moves itself translating with an 
uniform straight line movement along an axis, z in our 
case, orthogonal to it. Then the same material-point, 
of this kinematic description sums in it two 
movements, a rotation movement and a translation 
movement with the same constant translation velocity 
of the σ-plane. In this case, the material point goes 
along helix with a total velocity constant in 
magnitude.  
 
Generally, a point, which goes along a helix, not necessarily, must be a total velocity constant in 
magnitude; its movement is ever a roto-translation motion, that is a composition of a translation 
motion and a rotation motion. 
 
Therefore, the velocity of a point which describes in space a cylindrical helix, as in our model, can 
be decomposed in two components,  
• one along z-axis, it is the translational velocity component; we indicate its magnitude with 
tr
V ; 
• the other in the σ-plane, it is the rotation velocity component, which is tangent to the helix 
circumference in σ-plane; we indicate its magnitude with 
tg
V . 
If 
tr
V  is constant, for the kinematic properties of the helix, 
tg
V  must be constant in size and in its 
direction of rotation. 
 
Our P+ and P- are exactly considered in our ideal model, as material points.

In geometry, a cylindrical helix (from Greek έλιξ , spire) is a curve in a three-dimensional space, 
giving by a line wrapped with a constant angle around a cylinder. This constant cylindrical helix 
screwing angle, the “helix angle” called, θ, is given by this equation, based on geometrical 
considerations,

Our photon structure is a rigid structure since the distance between P+ and P-, r, is constant in time 
during the photon propagation in empty space without any external perturbation. 
 
In this way, it is guaranteed the existence of a sort of transversal photonic disk totally empty, except 
for the dynamic localization of photon material components, on its borderline circumference.  
This disk diameter appears to remain constant during the normal propagation of a photon in an 
empty space without any external perturbation; all this corresponds to a photon dynamic double 
helicoidal structure which remains without any alteration in time, and we see that proper in empty 
space without any external perturbation, it happens. 
 
We know in photon there is a relation between λ , which is a longitudinal property of the e.m. wave 
(and of the photon) respecting its translation direction, and its transversal dimensions, perpendicular 
to its axis z.  
λ is connected with longitudinal periodically fluctuation of electric and magnetic field in the e.m. 
wave.   
 
In our model we explain all this, imaging the existence in the photon of two particles, P+ and P-, of 
opposite charge with a fixed finite and not null distance, r, between them, an electric dipole in other 
words, rotating and translating, which generates an electric and magnetic field which fluctuate 
giving oscillations that can explain e.m. wave and e.m. field.  
Then, it is necessary, as later we will show analysing electric and magnetic wave in our photon 
model, that P+ and P- stay in every time on a plane orthogonal to the z axis, in particular on an axis 
perpendicular to z, and that intersected z, the axis of the helices, in a point that we call O(t), a 
function of time, t , obviously being P+ and P- position time functions,

 and

O(t) ; we call it R=r/2, being r the constant distance between  P+ and P-,

Its relativistic mass, the mass of the center of mass is equal to the relativistic mass of the system, 
and then, of our real photon in analysis. 
This point moves itself only translating along z axis, the axis of propagation of our photon.

For the generality of our argumentation, this result about

the photon, of length λ, its intrinsic electric field makes a complete fluctuation. Having connected 
this fluctuation with the variation of the position in space of our photon electric dipole 
+
−P
P
, it 
needs that in the time of a complete rotation of P+ and P-, the system advances in z positive 
direction of a length of λ, that is our helixes must have a step of λ length. In order that all this 
happens, it needs in the period 
σ
T  of the uniform circular movement in σ-plane, which is the time 
necessary to the photon dipole, and then to P+ and P-, to assume again the same positions in σ-
plane, our system moves itself in translation along z-axis, of a step equal to λ. 
 
Called ω the angular speed of P+, or of P-, (they are the same by our architecture of the photon 
structure), the period, 
σ
T , of a complete rotation in σ-plane, is

The existence of a Spin, S , an intrinsic angular momentum of the photon not null, with its direction 
parallel xor antiparallel to the positive direction of z-axis, tells us intuitively, that there is in the

center of mass, c, in z direction (that is the positive direction of z-axis),

Let us determine the Spin of our photonic system, 
ph
Tot
S
_
.  
 
The Spin (angular momentum of spin) of a body or discrete system, is its total angular momentum 
associated with the rotation of its parts around its center of mass. 
Analysing the way in which we have defined the structure of the photon, we see that its component 
parts, P+ and P-, translate with the center of mass O(t), with the same velocity 
∧
z
c , and on the σ-
plane, orthogonal to z-axis, they go around O(t), (which is fixed in the σ-plane), in a circular 
movement with constant distance r/2 from O(t), and with a tangential velocity of idem direction of 
rotation and  magnitude,

Our photonic model gives reason of the two possible spin directions of a real photon, parallel xor

Not only, on the base of the precedent result, that told us 
Const

 for every photon in the empty 
space, with the same value independently of its energy, frequency and wavelength, we obtain here 
the constancy of spin magnitude, and its independence respecting photon frequency, ν, energy,

About the Momentum of the Photon in our Model  
 
We know that a photon has a momentum, 
ph
P , that we can write vectorially, in our inertial 
reference frame, and concerning the real photon we are describing theoretically:

Note that in the equation for momentum 
V
M
P =
 
the mass, that it needs, is the relativistic mass; in other words, the relativistic mass is the 
proportionality constant between the velocity and the momentum. For this reason in the calculations 
about spin we have employed the relativistic masses. 
In our model, photon system momentum, 
ph
Tot
P
_
, must be equal to 
ph
P .  
The total momentum of a system, 
ph
Tot
P
_
 in this case, is a vector quantity, and it can be computed 
by adding together vectorially the momenta of every component of the system.

 is a resulting vector whose action line, according to composition rules of applied vectors, 
and according to the symmetry of our system, is the z-axis line, which includes in it the O(t) point, 
the center of mass of our photonic model, where the 
ph
P  can be considered applied! The 
momentum direction of our photon system is that of the positive direction of z, that is the direction 
of the global system translation, coinciding with the direction movement of the real photon, here in 
analysis. 
The particular geometry of our dynamic model, though in a relativistic condition, defines and gives 
a physical importance to the center of mass which, resuming in it some same aspects of the real 
photon, appears like that photon in those reductive punctiform conceptions about it; a punctiform 
conception practically, valid in some theoretical interpretation of some physics phenomenon! 
O(t), middle point of 
−

P
segment in every time, can be considered a virtual theoretical particle, 
which corresponds to what it is classically, reductively, sometimes thought as the photon. We will 
see some its aspects, in which we will recognize the classical photon:  
 
• the motion of O(t) consists in a pure translation with an uniform rectilinear movement along 
z-axis, with c speed in vacuum, as for the classical photon of which we are studying a 
possible fine structure; 
• in O(t) it is applied 
ph
P , which is directed along z-axis, with the same magnitude and 
direction of the classic real photon, here in analysis; 
• geometrically, O(t) is the center of mass of our system; to the center of mass of a system, 
like what constitutes our photon, we must attribute a relativistic mass equal to the total 
relativistic mass of the system. The total relativistic mass is the sum of the relativistic 
masses of the system components, since the relativistic mass is synonymous with the total 
energy, and energy is an additive quantity; hence, in our case

Its mass, as mass of the center of mass of our system, is the relativistic mass of the total 
system, which is obviously for our theoretical architecture, the relativistic mass of the 
classical real photon here in analysis; idem for its total energy which is linearly proportional 
to the total relativistic mass; 
• as the real photon carries a finite momentum and a quantum of energy, so our system 
associated to it, and in theory its O point, carries the same momentum in all its vectorial 
properties, and the same quantum of energy; 
• to the center of mass of a system, like what constitutes our photon in our theory, we must 
attribute a rest mass equal to the total rest mass of our system. But, in difference respecting 
the relativistic mass, the rest mass of a composite system is not equal to the sum of the rest 
masses of the parts, unless all the parts are at rest. The invariant mass is another name for 
the rest mass, usually reserved for systems which consist of separated particles. The rest 
mass of an object or a discrete system, is the Newtonian mass as measured by an observer 
moving along with the object; unlike the relativistic mass, the rest mass does not depend on 
observer's frame of reference. The invariant mass of a closed system is also independent of 
observer or inertial frame, and it is a constant, a conservative quantity for closed systems 
and single observers, even during chemical and nuclear reactions.  
We know that the invariant mass of a single body, like a particle, or of a system, is given, 
considering its total energy and the magnitude of its total momentum vector, by:

Historically, in this my physics and mathematical study about photon, it was when I verified, 
at the end, the property of a null rest mass for my photon model, null like for the real 
photon, that I exclaimed “èureka!” (ηὕρηκα), or better “ìvvrika!” in the local Greek-Latin 
ancient Mediterranean language of my Italian region, Salento in Puglia, in the South-East of 
Italy! “èureka”, which means in Greek “I found”, is the famous exclamation of Archimedes, 
(the great Greek scientist lived in Sicilia, isle of the South-Italy, in the third century B.C.), 
after an his scientific discover.

Hence, a photon is a luxon, and in our model it conserves this property, but moreover 
appearing as a composite system of two opposite tachyons, that give reason of the other 
important experimental properties of the photon! Photon can be imagined again like a 
particle, a perfect luxon particle, but composed of two subparticles, tachyon particles! More 
details later. 
Note. It is important to remark, that O is a pure Euclidian point, a virtual theoretical particle, a 
geometrical punctiform particle, which reassumes in it important properties of the whole system.  
 
 
 
 
 
Some considerations about energy and momentum conservation 
In an entire closed isolated system:  
• the invariant mass is independent of observer or inertial frame, and it is a constant, a 
conserved quantity;  
• energy is a conserved quantity;  
• the total momentum is also conserved, as the rest mass.  
So it happens in a real photon, which moves itself in a space empty without any external fields or 
objects, (these are our “standard photon motion conditions”); so it must happen in our photon 
system in the same standard conditions of the environment during its existence and propagation!  
So that it happens, it needs, as a real photon does not radiate (mass-energy) outside it, so our 
photonic system does not radiate other e.m.w. different from itself. Since, we will demonstrate the 
dynamic stability of our system in standard conditions, the important point about a possible photon 
self-radiation, it will be discussed later, with more details and considerations. 
Note: the considerations about h, will bring us to consider the electrical friction produced by 
vacuum totally null, this explains perhaps, the “eternal stability” of a normal photon in vacuum, and 
the perfect respect of the law of inertia.  
Note: existence and propagation in a photon are two faces of the same money, since photon can not 
exist if it does not propagate!

Figure 3: a schematic representation of a photon in our model, focusing on its transversal section.   
 
Now, in our model we have for a photon a circular surface, A, a circle, described by the projection 
of the trajectories of its two structural particles, P+ and P-, on a surface orthogonal, to the photon 
translation direction.

It is on the base of this photonic physical aspect that we can understand the interactions at the basis 
of diffraction and other photonic behaviours, where it appears necessary having a similar magnitude 
between λ and D, the length of an object, or bore, in orthogonal disposition respecting the e.m. wave 
propagation direction. 
Our theoretical photonic disk is practically total empty, the position of photon matter constituents, 
P+ and P-, involve only its borderline circumference; 
• when the maximum length, D, of an object orthogonally to our photon system translation 
velocity direction, is :
λ
<<
D
, no significant influence is made on the system; 
• when the maximum length, D, of an object orthogonally to our photon system translation 
velocity direction,  is :
λ
≈
D
, the interaction with the system becomes evident. 
The whole is in perfect accord with physics observations for real photons and electromagnetic 
waves! 
The photonic penetration deep into a matter, generally, increases increasing the photon energy.  
On the base of this model, we can explain this aspect also observing that more a photon is energetic, 
more its interaction section is little, (A, adding corrections in order to include electric interaction 
effects of border), more it can go into a body formed microscopically by a discrete structure of 
atoms, since it can better penetrate into the vacuum space in the matter, without meeting obstacles.    
 
Now we can apply the first equation previously shown, for the helix angle, to calculate it

About the Stability of our Dynamic Photonic System 
 
 
 
At this point an important analysis is connected with the stability of our dynamic photonic system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an inertial Cartesian frame of reference, Oxyz, with z axis coinciding with our previous z axis, 
and with initial conditions: P+(r/2, 0, 0),  P-(-r/2, 0, 0),  
the movement equations of P+ and P-, can be so expressed :

These two cases are connected to the two possible intrinsic rotational directions for a photon, which 
are immediately connected to the two possible circular polarization for the elementary e.m. wave of 
the single photon, as we will show in detail later. 
 
For symmetric motives and simplicity, we consider in this exposition only the right handed case,

Now, we will consider the forces applied on P+, which are only, in our idealization, internal forces 
to the photonic system. 
 
There are two contributes,

one connected with Coulomb’s electrostatic force of attraction applied by P- electric field on P+,

 is a constant, since it is made of physics constants, fixed numbers and constant 
magnitudes, independent of photon energy,
ph
E
, and frequency, ν. 
 
Thus, we obtain by our  theoretical photon structure, a formula proper of linear relationship between 
the energy,
ph
E
,  and the frequency, ν, of the photon; in other words, 
ν
∝
ph
E
, since H is constant, 
 
ν
Η
=
ph
E
 
 
This surprising result is in perfect coherence with what is observed in nature and condensed in the 
important photon equation   
ν
h
E ph =
 
 
which tells that, experimentally, 
ν
∝
ph
E
, with the famous Planck constant h. 
 
Therefore, equalling the second members of the two equations, it must be,  
 
h
=
Η
. 
 
Note we have arrived to 
ν
Η
=
ph
E
, with H constant, without utilising the experimental datum 
ν
h
E ph =

Now, remembering the more particular result

Probably, it is another important feature that reveals as our model, which is theorized in this 
scientific work, describes the special inevitable kinematical configuration of the photon, derived by 
fundamental principles of conservation! 
 
 
 
Considerations about the generation of a photon 
  
We can image that when, in every way, it is created a photon of a precise quantum of energy, 
ph
E
, 
utilizing a pre-existent identical energy, (according to the “Conservation Energy Principle”), a 
couple of elementary charges with opposite signs is generated from null, not created since it exists 
in potency, or it is utilized a pre-existent couple with their two charges, (we imagine them 
punctiform), which are not in the same point of the space in the same time, then in this second case 
without problem of singularity connected with the divergence of the electric potential energy when 
spatial distance between two charges goes to zero in the limit. In every case it must be respected the 
“Conservation of Charge Principle”. Now, in this generation act, it happens an immediate transitory 
phase, in which each charge assumes an half of the energy (mass) of the system, no preference 
between them and their identical charge absolute value explains this symmetry in the photon 
structure. P+ and P-  take themselves to a precise r distance between them, and they begin moving 
itself with the described kinematics for them.  
P- and P+ take themselves in a geometric and kinematic system that correspond to a stable dynamic 
state, which gives to photon its special properties, among this the possibility to transport energy, 
momentum, the electromagnetic wave and so on, in vacuum; a stability which derived it from the 
properties of the Universe.  
In this stable state, distance r is an equilibrium distance according to the mass-energy of the system 
and the electrostatic internal interaction. R connected to the stability of the system, determines the 
particular λ (or identically ν), of the photon and of the connected e.m. wave, and this explains the 
famous equation for the photon: 
ν
h
E ph =
.  
Studying in deep the ways of photon generation, the photon and e.m. wave emissions, we can 
understand better the e.m. wave characteristics at the light of this photon structure.

We observe, that with this model of the photon, in the phenomena of transition between photons 
and matter-antimatter, the maintenance of the opposite charges in the photon at finite distances, not 
null, has the great physical and theoretical advantage that, in those phenomena, (which are called of 
annihilation or creation of pairs of matter-antimatter), phenomena of annihilation or generation 
from nothing of couples of charges are not involved, (as instead it is superficially believed until 
now),  thus avoiding problems of singularity in the electrical potential energy that these phenomena 
would have involved. 
 
 
Idealization in our Photonic Model 
and  
the Inside Gravitational Interaction in it 
“La Natura rivela i suoi segreti a chi la ama.” 
 (Oreste Caroppo) 
Note we consider, in this studies, an idealized condition, an empty space in which photon 
propagates without any external influence, no magnetic, electric or gravitational fields, no obstacles, 
only internal electromagnetic interaction between P+ and P-. This conditions we called “standard 
photon motion conditions”, or simply “standard conditions”. Then, the uniform and rectilinear 
translational propagation along z axis, with a speed c, happens accordingly with Newton’s first law 
of motion, “the law of inertia” called too. The rotational movement, which, combined with the first, 
generates the helicoidal trajectories in the time-space, is produced by the electromagnetic 
interaction between P+ and P-, (in particular by their electrostatic interaction). 
 
Really, between P+ and P-, another force of interaction exists, the gravitational interaction between 
the masses of P+ and P-, which is an attractive force, obviously respecting the “action-reaction 
principle”:

Consequently, we can be sure about the goodness of our approximation concerning to ignore the 
gravitation interaction in forces and in energy balancings in our photonic system.   
 
Note that an electrically neutral or charged accelerated massive particle, tachyon or bradyon, could 
lose its energy, according to some theories, by gravitational radiation of gravitons, that is 
gravitational waves, since it has a gravitational mass, which is its relativistic mass. For tachyon this 
is a gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Hence, this phenomenon can produce a reduction of the 
energy of a photon during its existence, but perhaps the gravitational energy dispersed by P+ could 
be absorbed by P- and vice versa, maintaining the total energy of the photon system constant in 
time … questions of investigation for future studies! 
 
 
 
Considerations about the Microscopical Tachyon Nature of the 
Photon in our Model  
“La luce si muove ad una velocità superiore alla velocità della luce!” 
 (Oreste Caroppo) 
Semi-photon particles P+ and P-, have a velocity decomposable in two components, one of 
translation, 
c
Vtr =
, and another of rotation, 
c
Vtg = , orthogonal to the first and also orthogonal to 
the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical helixes. Then, semi-photon particles have a total speed 
super-luminal (
c
VTot >
); semi-photon particles are for this raison, tachyons; 
 
• “tachyon”, (from Greek language, ταχυόνιον, {takhyónion}, from ταχύς, {tachýs}, i.e. 
“swift”, “fast”, “speedy”), is an hypothetical particle that travels at super-luminal speed, 
with 
c
VTot >
; tachyons have a rest mass not null and totally imaginary accordingly to the 
special relativity in order to have a real total energy; 
 
• “bradyon”, (from Greek language, βραδυόνιον, {bradyónion}, from  βραδύς “bradys”, 
“slow”), is called every ordinary particle that travels at sub-luminal speed, with 
c
VTot <
. 

                                                                                                                                 Oreste Caroppo

Bradyons are also called “tardyon”. These particles have a real and non-zero rest mass, 
accordingly to the special relativity; 
 
 
• “luxon”, (from Latin language “lux”, “light”) is every particle that travels at luminal speed, 
with 
c
VTot =
; luxons are massless particle, particle whose rest mass is zero, accordingly to 
the special relativity. The photon and the graviton, respectively, the quantum of e.m. field 
and of the gravitational field, are luxons.   
 
 
For us, to date, tachyons are exotic theoretical particles, never detected, but their existence, it is an 
important point, is not against relativity!  
 
Note that already the existence of a not null spin in a photon, with direction parallel to z-axis, tells 
us intuitively, thinking to quantum spin as in Newtonian physics, that some photon constituent parts 
have a component of their velocity, orthogonal to the c-velocity of translation, therefore this 
implicates a their total speed super-luminal!  
 
P+ and P- have, like tachyons, relativistic mass,

 of the photon in our model, can not be casual, but 
it must derive from more profound reasons that our studies involve to investigate! 
 
Quantum theory applied to tachyons shows that they must be spinless particles. There is no reason 
to suppose a priori that tachyons must be either neutral or charged. They also must be created and 
annihilated in pairs, if charged with charges of identical magnitude and opposite sign.  

                                                                                                                                 Oreste Caroppo

All these properties mathematically predicted in the physics theory about tachyons, are perfectly in 
accord with the theoretic features of our P+ and P- tachyons, properties implied by photon real 
physical properties in our model.  
 
Now, connected with the special value of the Lorentz factor 
i
−
=
γ
, we will show in our model an 
interesting aspect of conservation, in the phenomenon of the photon pair generation, the 
transformation of a photon in a matter-antimatter pair of particles.  
Consider the theoretical limit case in the photon pair generation, in which the energy of the photon 
is exactly equal to the energy relativistically connected with the total rest mass of the generated 
pair. We take here, for instance, the electron-positron pair. 
• Electron has an elementary negative charge, –e, and a rest mass  
e
o
m _ . 
• Positron, the antielectron, so called too, has an elementary positive charge, +e, and a rest 
mass 
e
o
m _ , exactly equal to the electron rest mass.  
We image the speeds of the two particles null or near zero, after their generation, this implies their 
rest mass and their relativistic mass are equal, 
e
e
o
m
m
=
_
 . 
  
Then, in these limit conditions,

c
m
E
e
ph =
 
(for the photon generation pair, it must be 
2

c
m
E
e
ph ≥
 ) 
Now we image that in the photon pair generation:  
• the photon sub-particles P-, which has a charge -e, and a relativistic mass  
e
ph
m
c
E
=
2
2
, 
becomes the electron, or it gives origin to it, since it has the same charge and relativistic 
mass (and then energy); 
• the photon sub-particle P+, which has a charge +e, and a relativistic mass  
e
ph
m
c
E
=
2
2
, 
becomes the positron, or it gives origin to it, since it has the same charge and relativistic 
mass (and then energy). 
In this new setting, we consider the variation of the rest masses: 
• P-    has a rest mass

These interesting observations signal, perhaps, an important principle underlying.  
In conclusion, we remark interesting constant aspects in the photons, according to our model,

 of P+ and P- .  
A great geometric perfection appears at the basis of the photon structure and dynamics!  
Note: other very important properties, of our photon model, can be derived by an energetic analysis 
of it, using the principle of conservation of the total energy, which must be a sum of the potential 
and kinetic energies of the two sub-particles of the photon in our theory!    
 
Considerations about Photon as a Not Radiative Accelerated 
Dipolar System 
In our system we have charges accelerated, it happens since semi-photon particles, P+ and P-, 
which are charged, although they have a constant magnitude of their velocity, have a curvilinear 
trajectories, hence a centripetal acceleration.  
According to the electromagnetic radiation theory, a charge accelerated radiates an electromagnetic 
wave, which is energy diffused in space, that reduces the energy of the same charged particle.  
It would happen in accelerating tachyons with an electric charge, just like in ordinary accelerating 
charged particles, (accelerating charged bradyons); in particular in tachyon case, being the particle 
superluminal, the emitted radiation would be a Cherenkov radiation, just as ordinary charged 
particles do when they exceed the local speed of light of the propagation medium. As a 
consequence of this emission, the total energy of an accelerated charged tachyon, so as of an 
accelerated charged bradyon, decreases.  
Conservation of proper energy of our photon system is very important for the adherence of our 
model to the reality, but also for the dynamic stability of our photon model. Conservation of proper 
energy is exactly what happens in a photon, which is the fruit of an irradiation process, and not 
itself a radiative system.

Now, the total emission or not of its energy in an e.m. radiation, by our photon model, is an 
important theoretical study to prove the reliability or to understand the physical validity, of our 
photon model.   
In our system for its particular geometric, kinematic and dynamic properties, and since P+ and P- 
have two charges of opposite sign and idem magnitude, it is probably that the electromagnetic wave 
issued by P+ and that issued by P-, interfere destructively, then none electromagnetic wave is 
issued by our photonic system, and nothing of its energy is dispersed in radiation! Continuously P+ 
issues radiation energy and absorbs in the same time a same quantity of energy radiated in space by 
P-, idem for P- respecting P+; a non-stopped and continuous push and pull of radiation energy 
between P- and P+, which assures the conservation of the energy of our photon model during its 
stationary existence ( = propagation), which maintains continuously constant and identical to the 
half of the total relativistic mass, the masses of P+ and P-. 
In other way, we can image that as in the atom, where an electron can go around nucleus without 
emitting radiation although it is a charged accelerated particle, in the same way and by the same 
principles and reasons, no emission happens in the photon structure for its charged accelerated sub-
particles! To the limit we can image photon emits continuously and totally itself giving origin to its 
propagation in space-time...and so on with various hypothesis! 
Mathematically, in this valuation, it will be very interesting to value if the electromagnetic dynamic 
field generated by the two charges, in this photon model, (and constituted by the electric and 
magnetic fields generated by those two charges in motion, considering the simple Coulomb’s 
electric force, and the magnetic force generated by them, in a dynamic situation with the movement 
of the two charged origins of he two fields, and in the hypothesis of an instantaneous effect at 
distance of the electric and magnetic interaction, as later discussed), satisfies the Maxwell’s 
equations for an electromagnetic wave! In the positive case, our photon model, which is a 
relativistic model, should be implicated by the same classical Maxwell’s theory, which is a theory 
of the electromagnetic field in coherence with Einstein’s theory of special relativity!  
 
 
 
Considerations about Planck constant “to the light” of our 
Photonic Model 
“Tutti vogliono descrivere il cosmo, ma nessuno vuole prima descrivere h !” 
 (Oreste Caroppo) 
In particular condition, a photon can transform itself into a couple of particles of matter and 
antimatter, each one with a same rest mass, equal or minor to the half of the relativistic mass of the 
original photon, and with opposite elementary electric charge, e, respecting in this way the “charge 
conservation principle”; the constancy of the total charge before, during and after photon 
transformation into a particle-antiparticle pair, generally of an electron and a positron (anti-
electron). Before, the total photon charge is null, and after the total charge of the matter-antimatter 
pair is null again,

In theory, the two elementary and complementary charges can stay in the same point annihilating 
between them; a point can have infinite couples of complementary charges, (that is with null total 
charge); this is theoretically possible or in any case, ever in accord with the charge conservation 
principle; classically, it is the conception about photon and then, about the state before the 
generation pair, the two complementary charges of the pair were thought as not existent or it is the 
same, existent in the same point, the punctiform photon point of a classic theoretical photon 
conception.  Now instead, we have already in our photon model the two elementary and 
complementary charges existing separately in space, in the two material constituent photon points, 
P+ and P-, (their middle point, O(t), coincided with the photon mass center identifiable with the 
classic theoretical punctiform photon); in their separated existence and in their electro-magnetic 
dynamic stability it consists the same photon, its energy, its particular propagation at the speed of 
light in vacuum space, its properties and those of the electron-magnetic wave; dynamic stability of 
our photon model is connected to the electro-magnetic interaction between charges! All this on the 
base of the universal conservation principles, special relativity, dynamic laws, classical electrostatic 
and magnetostatic interaction laws. 
At this point of our written, we can analyse the significance of Planck constant at the light of this 
new photonic theory.

Although, P+ and P- are in vacuum space, the electrostatic interaction between their charges 
happens with a different Coulomb’s constant value! In particular with a new value which remains 
constant for every photon, but which is much grander than K! 
It is as P+ and P- charges see a different vacuum, a vacuum with different properties in relation 
with them. The electrical attraction strength is much grander for their charges between them, 
respecting the electrical strength between two same charges in the same distance and empty space, 
but quite or in subluminal speed conditions, (the conditions in which until now experimentally 
Coulomb’s law is been analyzed and measured, and in which for Coulomb’s constant, a constant K 
value is been ever calculated for charges in vacuum)!  
The only way we have to explain this discrepancy is this:  
the dielectric characteristics of empty space, of vacuum, change if a charge is in sub-luminal 
conditions (or quite to the limit), or in super-luminal conditions!  
This can happen because vacuum is not really empty! As Casimir effect reveals and quantum 
mechanics theory suggests on the base of the “indetermination principle” of Werner Heisenberg, 
called “Heisenberg’s principle” or “uncertainty principle” too, vacuum is not really empty. In 
vacuum there are a lots of matter-antimatter pairs of particles, of particle-antiparticle pairs. 
According to the orthodox interpretation of Heisenberg’s principle of indetermination, they are 
short-lived couples of particles, ephemeral quantum fluctuations of vacuum, and consequently, they 
are called “virtual particles”, “virtual pairs”; in another way, we can consider them as fundamental 
constituents of a finite vacuum energy density. Some of these “virtual” particle-antiparticle pairs are 
charged, (e.g., virtual electron-positron pairs); such charged couples are therefore, pairs of charges, 
(e+)- (e-); the totally charge of an empty space associated with this particles, is then null, but their 
existence creates in vacuum a spatial charge distribution which can be electrified, polarized, by an 
external charge particle put in that space or near it! Infect, these charged “virtual” pairs act as 
electric dipoles, which can be polarized. In the presence of an external electric field, (e.g., the 
electromagnetic field around an electron as its source, which is a charged bradyon), these particle-
antiparticle pairs react, and they reposition themselves, breaking their symmetry of null their total 
also called “Sommerfeld fine-
structure constant”

field, creating in this way a their opposite electric field, thus partially counteracting the external 
field; it is a sort of dielectric effect. Therefore the resulting field will be weaker of what would be 
expected if the vacuum were completely empty. This reorientation of the short-lived particle-
antiparticle pairs is referred to as “vacuum polarization”; vacuum is like a sort of dielectric 
material! This dielectric effect acts as a partial screening effect too; infect, vacuum electrification 
induced by an external charge screens the same charge reducing its effective electric field in 
vacuum, that is its total final electrostatic effect over another charge in space! All this happens 
normally with charges in vacuum, and this effect is quantified in K, Coulomb’s constant for 
vacuum! Coulomb’s electrostatic interaction law, with K as constant, is been observed and 
confirmed for charges in subluminal state, as to the limit, with charges in quite or in subluminal 
speed near the speed of light in vacuum, too! To date, never directed observations about charged 
tachyons, since never a tachyon has been detected in our experimental ways in physics to observe 
nature.  
We can think that in vacuum there is in every moment and in every point of the universe a constant 
density of matter-antimatter pairs with the same statistic characteristics and energy distribution in 
them. It is a constant property of vacuum, or perhaps a property of the universe changing in the 
universe evolution!   
We think, that for the electrification of vacuum, in particular for the polarization of its matter-
antimatter pairs, a particular intrinsic inertial exists! 
Then, until a charge moves itself in subluminal conditions, virtual couples have the time to polarize 
themselves rapidly, the time to screen the external charge, and we have the traditional magnitude K, 
for the traditional Coulomb’s constant for the empty space, in the electrical interaction between two 
charges in the same subluminal kinematic conditions. 
When the speed of a charge is over a special speed as c, or superior, certainly when its speed is 
c

, we think that a charge goes through the vacuum, which is full of virtual particles, so 
rapidly that, by their inertial, matter-antimatter virtual pairs have not the sufficient time to polarized 
themselves; it is like the couples do not see the passage of the superluminal charge, though they 
continue to perceive the electric (and magnetic) field of that charge!  
Note: we image, here, an instantaneous modification in the whole universe of the electrostatic field, 
with the motion of its charge source!  
Then, in electric interaction, and consequently in the magnetic interaction, this superluminal charge 
appears without an electrical screen, without an electrified space around it, and it can explain a 
bigger electrical influence over other charges. Vacuum seen by these superluminal charges, appears 
really empty, therefore, we call this vacuum condition, which concerns a particular charge speed 
state, Super-Vacuum, (SV in acronym). 
In our photonic model P+ and P-  are two charged particles in this special speed condition. In their 
Coulomb’s electric interaction, Coulomb’s constant

it is connected proper to the “fine structure” of vacuum, which is not really empty, but characterized 
by a distribution of matter-antimatter pairs.  
Planck constant value is an experimental result, that is directly influenced by the density of the 
vacuum energy and by the distribution of its virtual particles, then, h is the main key to explore and 
understand the vacuum in our Universe. 
 
Perhaps, these considerations suggest also a road to understand why it is possible for a photon to 
translate in a uniform straight line movement, accordingly to Newton’s first law of motion, the law 
of inertia, with light speed, c. It happens since in vacuum in absence of any gravitational, magnetic 
and electric resulting force, not any friction effect acts on semi-photon particles!  
By the characteristics of our photon model, vacuum space appears to it almost completely empty, 
the super-vacuum which is a not-polarized vacuum; then, in the absence of every external field, in 
vacuum there is nothing which can brake our photon; without polarization, virtual particles exercise 
no distance interaction on the superluminal semi-photon particles; if we add that according to us, all 
the fine particles of nature are punctiform, as the virtual particles and the semi-photon particles, the 
possibilities of a collision between them, becomes very much low, and in these idealized conditions, 
what we will see it is a perfect respect in the photon behaviour of the “law of inertia”, exactly what 
happens really for a real photon in vacuum! 
Continuing to consider for the equation of the electrical interaction between the two complementary 
charges of  the photon, the normal magnitude for Coulomb’s constant in vacuum, K , we necessary 
must attribute a different magnitude, Q ,  to the charges of P+ and P-, ever two charges opposite 
and of the same value, for the same symmetric reasons.

Really, the two charges of photon are in absolute value the elementary charge, e, but since space 
around them is not electrified, as instead, in example, for an electron, (a charged bradyon of the 
same magnitude charge), they have a bigger electrical effect in the same empty space in which we 
consider the electron; therefore without considering the modification of the dielectric properties of 
vacuum, and then the modification of Coulomb’s constant for superluminal charges, it appears as 
the two photon charges, conserving their opposite original signs, have a magnitude Q , bigger than 
the elementary charge e!

We do not investigate here the groups of photons and the interaction among photons, which are 
important points of analysis to explain on the base of our electric model of the photon, the 
properties of the electromagnetic waves. 
 
In Photon Structure the “Wave-Corpuscle Dualism” of Light 
Our electric-double helicoidal model of photon is a sort of undulatory-corpuscular theory of photon, 
which integrates the two experimental natures of photon (that is of light, in its more general 
meaning, intending with it every wave of the e.m. radiation spectrum), that undulatory of wave and 
that corpuscular of particle (corpuscle); in this way with one theory we resolve and explain the 
dogmatic phenomenon of the “wave-corpuscle dualism” of photon, which is until now at the basis 
of the optical studies, of photon and of the electromagnetic radiation.

Perspectives of Investigation 
Our microscopic structure for photon, the consequent interpretation of Planck constant and the 
discovery of possible tachyon semi-photon particles, opens a vast range of analysis in the studies of 
nature, and like a little physics revolution, they take us towards a more profound comprehension of 
many physics aspects and phenomenons! Not only, it seems showing us a nature in which it is 
possible an instantaneous non-local action at a distance for some interactions, that resurrects an old 
conception in our age essentially refused, but which appears again necessary to explain non-local 
quantum entanglement phenomenons! Photon carries momentum and energy and it explains the 
momentum and the energy transported in a finite time at a distance by the electromagnetic wave 
made by one or more photons. But now, inside the photon its structure appears based on an 
instantaneous Coulomb’s electrostatic interaction. Now, the electrostatic interaction must be, or it 
seems to be, an instantaneous non local action at a distance, that is it happens with an infinite speed 
and a zero time although the existence of a finite distance, (the same for the Lorentz’s magnetostatic 
interaction), all this in accord with our mathematic description of our photon model and with the 
logical consideration that no photon can generate, “mediate”, the electrostatic interaction inside the 
same photon; it would be a recursive reasoning!  
That which is implicated, by this new model of the photon for the electromagnetic interaction, is in 
harmony with Isaac Newton’s conception for the gravitational field, in its theory for gravity, since 
Newton thought that gravitation was an instantaneous interaction at distance. 
All this is in conflict with those theories, in modern physics, that think the gravitational field and 
the electromagnetic field are mediated by particular particles; fields in which the interaction would 
be mediated by particles; particles that would be exchanged, emitted and absorbed, continuously, 
and that would be characterized by a finite speed, not exceeding the speed of light, c. These “force-
mediating particles”, with an energy, and then a mass, would be the photon for the electromagnetic 
field, and the graviton for the gravitational field. The graviton would have a speed identical to c, the 
same speed of light, and then of the photon!  
But the features of the “black holes”, theorized and astronomically discovered, which tell us that, in 
a black hole, mass and charge do not disappear, but they continue to interact  normally, with, 
respectively, masses and charges in the whole Universe, out of the black hole, reveal that 
gravitational and electromagnetic interactions are not mediated  by particles, respectively the 
graviton and the photon, since, no mass, then no light, no particles, no energy can normally be 
emitted by a black hole, in coherence with its nature in physics, and its same eloquent name!

Some Considerations about Electric and Magnetic Fields of a 
Photon in our Model 
A photon, in our model, is made by a distribution of charges, a rigid distribution of two charges 
which constitute an electrical dipole. It generates around it an electric field typical of a dipole, a 
field which changes its position instantly everywhere, with the movement of the photon in space, 
then with the movement of its sources, (the inside photon charges), the movement of its source 
dipole. Since the two charges move themselves, they create around them a magnetic field too, 
connected obviously, with their electric field. Hence, we have in a single photon an electric and a 
magnetic field, of which vectors and field lines are rigid with the photon dipole, and then, they 
change in space and time during photon propagation!  
Note: we image, as already told, an instantaneous modification in the whole universe of the 
electrostatic field, (and hence, of the magnetostatic field), with the motion of its charge source!  
Photon, which is classically the carrier of the electromagnetic field, has in its intrinsic structure the 
origin, the sources of  the electric and magnetic fields changing in time and space; the fields which 
are those of its electromagnetic wave. All this which is obvious and which is predicted now in this 
theory, could not be explained with the traditional conception of the photon like a one particle 
without any internal charge distribution. 
I am trustful that deepening the generation, emission and absorption of photon, and the interaction 
between groups of photons, it will be possible to explain the traditional theoretical properties of 
Maxwell’s electromagnetic fields and waves, and the optical phenomenons, with the properties of 
photon according to our model, and to explain deeply the interactions between photons and 
particles, atoms and molecules! 
Here, we will analyse only the characteristics of the electric and magnetic field of the photon in its 
center of mass point, O(t); an important geometrical photon point, in our model, we told which can 
represent perfectly for some same aspects, the common and diffuse classic conception of the photon 
as a punctiform particle.    
Now, to explore the electric field, 
ph
E
, generated by our photon, it needs a probe charge q.  
Note: do not confuse
ph
E
, the electric field, with 
ph
E
, the total energy of the photon!  
The electric field will be different if q is associated to a subluminal particle or to a particle with a 
velocity of magnitude 
c
2 .  
In the second case, to calculate electric field, we must take
SV
K
 for Coulomb’s constant, and for P+ 
and P-, their normal charges, respectively, +e and –e.

In the first case, we imagine that, in our frame of reference, q is motionless (its velocity V = 0), or 
with a speed in magnitude very more small than the velocity c (V << c); with good approximation, 
beyond a certain distance between q (we consider punctiform) and the point P+, (and between q 
and the point P-), here we can take for Coulomb’s constant, the classic K magnitude for empty 
space, and for the charges of P+ and P-, their corrected magnitude, respectively, 
Q
+
 and 
Q
−
, 
which we have previously calculated; all this, in consequence of the vacuum polarization for q, and 
of the absence of a vacuum polarization for the charges of P+ and P-.  
To date, experimentally, we are, ever, in this first case, we will consider. 
In a generic point P, the electric field generated by a photon in a precise time, t, is

accord with the spin of the photon, which defines the screwing direction of the circular polarization

two photon sub-particles of the same photon. 
All this remembers exactly, the property of the electric vector in a plane monochromatic Maxwell’s 
electromagnetic wave, with the wavelength the same of our photon, when the wave is polarized 
circularly; in this case the wave electric field vector, (which is orthogonal to the induction vector

handed, depending on the direction in which the electric field vector rotates; right-handed or left-

take in this work, the first convention, which coincides with the general convention normally 
adopted about spin direction! If you could stop time and look at the electric field along the beam, its 
vector apex would trace a helix around the propagation direction, with one xor the other of the two 
possible circular polarizations; proper a similar property we can observe in our photon, for

The electric interaction between two charges is mutual, since it is valid Newton’s third law of 
motion, the law of reciprocal actions; consequently, we understand the possibility that a charge has 
to perturb a photon; a perturbative interaction which, probably, explains partly in the 
electromagnetic radiation, like the light, the diffractive effects of deviation of the trajectories of the 
photon near the borders of an object, normally clad by clouds of negative charges, of electrons. 
About the magnetic field generated by our photon in a generic point P, in an instant, we use the 
expression of the magnetic field generated by a single charge in movement, for the two charges of 
P+ and P-, and then, we take their vectorial sum, as we have made for the electric field, in accord 
now, with the superimposition principle of the magnetic field.

Conclusions 
This didactic presentation of my photon model will be obviously perfected by other works about it 
with a more complex mathematics and a more profound discussion about relativity and so on, but it 
is its disarming simplicity that gives us a great trust about its true relevancy with the real nature of 
the photon! 
Many other characteristics and properties of the electromagnetic waves and of their photons can 
find explanations to the light of this “Caroppo’s Photon Model”. Not only, it opens us a road to 
explain the microscopic structure of the elementary particles and to progress in physical and 
technical development. It lights us about profound aspects of the quantum physics and the 
superluminal speed in nature, and perhaps it will allow solving some epistemology problems 
opened again.  
In the previous exposition in no point I polemized about quantum physics ideas and developments, 
but it is evident that this new my model can implicate some revision about them! 
This is only a little theory, though gigantic in the prospectives which it could open, if it will be 
verified. In the scientific method, we are here, only to the step of the hypotheses of a possible 
theoretical model of our investigated object, the photon, after the observations about a group of 
features of it; properties which can have a complete explanation proper in our photon dynamic 
structure. A little prediction from our architectural conjecture, is the linear relationship between 
photon energy and its frequency, which is verified in the real photon, by 
ν
h
E ph =
; this equation 
gives us, in a second  step, the opportunity to find the correct values of our constant parameters (the 
internal speeds and the dielectric constant of the internal electric interactions), arriving to an exact 
explanation of the analyzed photon features.  
I am sure that with your interest and attention, we will can deduce soon other predictions of this  
heuristic model of explanation, in order to set up experiments to test if it is a good theoretical base 
for an our further broadening in the knowledge of the loved and beautiful Nature which surrounds 
us and of which we are, with our body and thought, indivisible parts! 
 
Bibliography      
For the particular nature of this work, I am sure you excuse me if I indicate here no books or 
articles. This work did not born in a precise restricted current of physics studies, it is debtor to every 
men who has preceded me in the speculations about nature, its reality and its ideas, and its 
wonderful mysterious mathematic order!
