 A redetermination of the radial velocity and distance of the globular cluster NGC 5694 reveals that with
 .respect to the galactic center it lies at r = 26 ± 5 kpc with a velocity of vc' < -273 ± 19 km s"1. The
 escape velocity at the location of the cluster is uesc = 190 ± 35 km s- 1 for a conventional mass model of the
 Galaxy, which would indicate that NGC 5694 is indeed in a hyperbolic orbit. Alternatively, assuming the
 cluster to be in a bound orbit would require the galactic halo within r - 25 kpc to contain a mass
 > 0.8 X 1011 Wo, comparable with that of the disk.
 Key words: globular clusters - radial velocities - galactic structure
 The distant globular cluster NGC 5694 (a =
 14h36^7, Ô = -26° 19' (1950); I = 332°, b = +30°)
 has been recognized for many years as an object which
 may not be gravitation ally bound to the Galaxy.
 Earlier discussions (von Hoerner 1955; Kinman 1959£>;
 Sandage and Wildey 1967) demonstrated that virtually
 all the known globular clusters could consistently be
 assumed to have bound orbits; by far the single most
 outstanding exception was NGC 5694, which from the
 older data appeared to be almost necessarily in a
 hyperbolic orbit.
 Determination of its orbital status rests on two
 measured quantities, its radial velocity and distance
 from the galactic center. As was indicated by Kin-
 man (1959fo), the previous analyses were hampered by
 large uncertainties in both of these numbers: the only
 available radial-velocity measurement was based on
 low-dispersion spectrograms taken from the Northern
 Hemisphere, and the distance modulus estimate was
 derived principally from old 25-brightest-stars data.
 Clearly a modern investigation of this cluster is long
 overdue. We have recently obtained new observa-
 tions of both the cluster distance and velocity, and
 with these a firmer discussion of its orbit can now be
 made.
 An image-tube spectrogram at --125Â mm"1 of
 NGC 5694 was taken with the Yale 1-m telescope at
 CTIO on 1975 September 1/2 during part of a larger
 program (Smith, Hesser, and Shawl 1976; Hesser and
 Shawl, in preparation). Measurement of the spec-
 trum from Ha to Ca ii K compared with five spectra
 of four radial-velocity standard stars on the same plate
 yielded vr = - 174 ± 28 km s"1. This value agrees
 within the errors of measurement with the earlier
 determination of vr = - 187± 27 km s"1 (Mayall
 1946, as discussed by Kinman 1959a), which Mayall
 obtained from the average of four spectra at 430 Â
 mm"1. The result provides confidence that no serious
 errors exist in the radial-velocity part of the data, and
 we average the CTIO and Lick results to obtain vr =
 -180± 19kms-J.
 The cluster distance modulus used in the older
 studies presents a more serious problem. The first
 available color-magnitude diagram for NGC 5694
 (Harris 1975) reveals the giant branch beginning at V
 - 19^5, (B- V) - 1™4 and continuing downward to
 the limit of the study (Vlim ~ 18m), but does not ap-
 pear to resolve the horizontal branch. However, a
 preliminary analysis of some much deeper (Vlim ~
 22m, Blim ~~ 23m) photographic material recently ob-
 tained with the CTIO 4-m telescope (Harris, in prepa-
 ration) shows an unmistakeable blue horizontal branch
 starting at VHB = lffM ±0.2. With MV(HB) = (T6 ±
 0.3 (Sandage 1970), EB_V = (T08 (Harris 1976), and
 AVIEB_V = 3.3 (Aann estad and Purcell 1973), we ob-
 tain (m-M)o = 17^54 ± 0.36 and Do = 32 ± 5 kpc.
 This places the cluster significantly closer than the
 earlier estimate of DQ = 42 ± 12 kpc (Kinman 1959a)
 and shows, not surprisingly for such a distant object,
 that the old brightest-stars estimate was in error. If
 the distance between the sun and galactic center is
 fío = 9 kpc (e.g. Harris 1976), then the galactocentric
 distance of NGC 5694 is r = 26 ± 5 kpc.
 To evaluate the orbit of the cluster, we use the
 "representative" galactic mass model of Innanen (1973),
 for which fío = 9 kpc and the rotational velocity at
 the sun is 0-225 km s~l. Subtracting the com-
 ponent of©0 along the cluster line of sight (with vr =

 since its transverse motion is unknown.
 At r = 26 ± 5 kpc the escape velocity for Innanen's
 (1973) standard mass model is vesc ~ 190 ± 35 km s"1
 with respect to the galactic center.* The difference
 'vc'' ~ lüescl = 77 km s"1 is larger than the combined
 errors in vci and üesc, and implies that NGC 5694 must
 indeed be escaping from the Galaxy unless the con-
 ventional mass model is drastically wrong. In order to
 raise uesc up to -250 km s~l we would have to set
 3»gal > 1.9 X 1011 9»o, i.e., almost double its presently
 estimated value. The reason for this is that adding
 mass inside r = Rq would increase t>esc, but would also
 force a corresponding increase in @0 (and hence vci;
 cf. the discussion of Harris (1975)) and so |uci| - |fesc|
 would decrease slightly (by 10 km s"1 for each 25 km
 s"1 increase in 0O). Thus the assumption that
 NGC 5694 is in a bound orbit appears to force the
 adoption of a "massive halo" for the Galaxy. Although
 uncertainties do still exist in the observed radial
 velocity and distance, we believe the current data now
 place sufficiently stringent limits to indicate that the
 more important problem is likely the galactic mass
 distribution itself.
 If the conventional mass models are more or less
 correct, and NGC 5694 is in a hyperbolic orbit, then is
 it an intergalactic object which is simply "passing
 through," or is it a normal galactic globular cluster
 that has somehow been pushed into a higher-energy
 orbit? We feel that the latter hypothesis may be more
 likely, since other characteristics of NGC 5694 re-
 semble those of the "normal" globular clusters instead
 of the extremely distant objects (Palomar clusters
 and/or dwarf spheroidal systems) which lie on the
 outer fringes of the galactic halo. These latter objects
 possess several distinctive characteristics (cf. Harris
 1976 and references cited therein) that separate them
 from the more nearby clusters: (1) diffuse, low-
 density structures that would not survive close tidal
 encounters with the Galaxy; (2) extremely low heavy-

 with Wga] = 1.1 X lOllvJ0?0, following Innanen. Inspection of
 Innanen's detailed models shows that more than 95% of the
 mass lies within r ~ 25 kpc, and that the tabulated escape
 velocity in the disk at r = 26 kpc differs from our point-mass
 estimate by less than 5%.
 element abundance; (3) peculiar color-magnitude
 diagrams with predominantly red horizontal branches
 and steep giant branches; (4) peculiar variable stars;
 and (5) nonisotropic distribution in space. NGC 5694,
 on the other hand, is a compact, moderately luminous
 cluster which does not differ in any obvious way ex-
 cept its space motion from many other typical halo
 clusters. It is hard to see how such a cluster could
 have formed in isolation in intergalactic space. While
 we plan to improve the precision with which the
 radial velocity and distance are known, we also sug-
 gest that calculations to trace back the orbit o
 NGC 5694 from its presently observed position and
 velocity (perhaps with various starting assumptions
 about its transverse motion) might prove valuable.
 One additional parameter of the cluster orbit which
 we can estimate roughly is the perigalactic distanc
 rp, which is determined once the "tidal radius" of
 NGC 5694 is known. Although star counts of the type
 described by Peterson and King (1975) are preferable
 for determining tidal radii, such data are as yet un-
 available for NGC 5694. Instead, concentric-aperture
 photometry can be used to estimate the tidal radius
 more crudely as rt « 12 arc minutes (Harris, in prepa-
 ration). With the integrated cluster magnitude o
 Vt = 10.2 (Peterson and King 1975) and a mass-to
 light ratio WIL ~ 1.5 (Illingworth 1976), we obtain
 99îcl ^ 1.1 X 1053Wo for the total cluster mass. Finally
 applying the equations of King (1962) and Peterson
 (1974) we find that the orbit of NGC 5694 reache
 perigalacticon at rp ~ 14 kpc and has a minimum
 eccentricity emin = 0.32 (e = 1 for a parabolic orbit).
 Thus NGC 5694 now appears to be twice as far away
 from the galactic center as its perigalactic point, which
 itself is well out in the halo.
 The Magellanic Clouds appear to be the only ob-
 vious candidates with the right distance and sufficient
 mass to throw a halo globular cluster into a hyperbolic
 orbit, so it will be interesting to determine whether
 they could realistically have intersected the path of
 NGC 5694 during their last orbital passage. If the
 Clouds are indeed responsible for its present orbit,
 then it is also possible that NGC 5694 belonged
 originally to the cluster system of the Clouds and not
 the Galaxy. The forthcoming fainter color-magnitude
 study should provide further information on this
 possibility.
 We are pleased to thank J. A. Rose for generously
 allowing two hours of his telescope time to be applied
 to this problem, and Drs. K. I. Innanen and A. Toomre
 for helping to stimulate the discussion. This work was

 Research Council of Canada.
