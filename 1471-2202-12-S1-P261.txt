Analysis of information transfer between variables in
brain images is currently a popular topic, e.g. [1]. Such
work typically focuses on average information transfer
(i.e. transfer entropy[2]), yet the dynamics of transfer
from a source to a destination can also be quantified at
individual time points using the local transfer entropy
(TE) [3]. This local perspective is known to reveal dyna-
mical structure that the average cannot. We present a
method to quantify local TE values in time between
source and destination regions of variables in brain-ima-
ging data, combining:
a. computation of inter-regional transfer between two
regions of variables (e.g. voxels) [1], with
b. the local perspective of the dynamics of such trans-
fer in time [3].
Transfer is computed over samples from all variables
– there is no training in or subset selection of variables
to use.
We apply this method to a set of fMRI measurements
where we could expect to see differences in local infor-
mation transfer between two conditions at specific time
steps. The fMRI data set analyzed (from [4]) contains
brain activity recorded from 7 localized regions while 12
subjects (who gave informed written consent) were
asked to freely decide whether to push one of two but-
tons (with left or right index finger), whenever they felt
the urge to do so, and to press the button immediately
on deciding . To our knowledge, this is the first analysis
of transfer entropy on a local temporal scale in brain-
imaging data (at specific time points rather than via slid-
ing windows).
Significant differences in the local TE between left and
right button presses are revealed in a significant number
of subjects (7) by:
a. examining the difference in local TE from a single
source region (e.g. pre-SMA) into left and right motor
cortex respectively (e.g. see Figure 1 for subject 1); and
b. aggregating local TE differences across 2 to 3 conse-
cutive time steps (e.g. t=2,4 and 6 sec. after button
press).
Additionally, thresholding of these TE differences
can decode the button push with a (statistically signifi-
cant) mean of 65% accuracy across subjects. These
measurements of local TE correlate well with the role
of these regions in executing the motor response here
[4]. We confirm that local TE can be used to reveal
differences in task-based dynamical information trans-
fer, with potential for the technique to be improved in
the future.
