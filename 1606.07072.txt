We study the properties of edge plasmons in two-component electron liquids in the presence of
pseudomagnetic ﬁelds, which have opposite signs for the two diﬀerent electronic populations and
therefore preserve the time-reversal symmetry. The physical realizations of such systems are many.
We discuss the cases of strained graphene and of electrons in proximity to a Skyrmion lattice, solving
the problem with the Wiener-Hopf technique. We show (i) that two charged counter-propagating
acoustic edge modes exist at the boundary and (ii) that, in the limit of large pseudomagnetic
ﬁelds, each of them involves oscillations of only one of the two electronic components. We suggest
that the edge pseudo-magnetoplasmons of graphene can be used to selectively address the elec-
trons of one speciﬁc valley, a feature relevant for the emerging ﬁeld of valleytronics. Conversely,
the spin-polarized plasmons at the boundary of Skyrmion lattices can be exploited for spintronics
applications. Our solution highlights new features missing in previous (similar) results obtained
with uncontrolled approximations, namely a logarithmic divergence of the plasmon velocity, and the
absence of gapped edge modes inside the bulk-plasmon gap.

INTRODUCTION
Nanoplasmonics,1 which aims at compressing electro-
magnetic radiation to sub-wavelength scales by coupling
it to matter waves, has recently experienced a strong
revival.2–4 Among the reasons, the discovery of two-
dimensional (2D) materials has played a major role.5–15
Due to their quasi-2D nature, the atomically-thin lay-
ers of van-der-Waals solids exhibit many remarkable and
intriguing optical properties:11–13,16 they naturally allow
to conﬁne the radiation at a surface by coupling it with
mobile electrons, thus forming surface-plasmon polari-
tons.2,15,17,18 In this respect, graphene has attracted a
lot of interest, especially for its record-high plasmon life-
times:14,15 plasmon losses have indeed represented so far
the fundamental bottleneck for nanoplasmonic applica-
tions.19
When a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld is applied to
a 2D charged liquid, collective modes localized at the
edge naturally arise.20–22 These “edge magnetoplasmons”
have a linear low-energy dispersion, and are decoupled
from the (gapped) bulk modes.22 Such modes can be ex-
tremely long lived thanks to the strong conﬁnement at
the edge and their quasi-one-dimensionality,23 and have
been extensively studied in the past.20,21 Fetter20 calcu-
lated their dispersion in a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG), even though its analytical solution exploited an
uncontrolled approximation. Later he solved the prob-
lem of edge plasmons in the presence of nearby grounded
metal plates by numerical methods.24 Notably, edge mag-
netoplasmons can propagate in both directions along the
edge, i.e. they are not chiral in a strict sense. However,
chirality is still present since the “wrong-direction” plas-
mon is gapped, and its gap frequency increases with the
magnetic ﬁeld.20
In
many
systems,
electrons
experience
pseudo-
magnetic ﬁelds, whose main characteristic is to preserve
the global time-reversal symmetry. This is the case, e.g.,
of strained graphene.25–27 Strain, modifying the hopping
parameters, enters the low-energy Hamiltonian as a vec-
tor potential A(r, t). The global time-reversal invariance
is assured by the fact that A has opposite signs on the two
inequivalent valleys (K and K′) of the Brillouin zone. In
spite of this, Landau quantization has been observed in
strained samples and the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld has been
shown to reach values of hundreds of Tesla.28 This sys-
tem is, from the point of view of the energy spectrum,
equivalent to a quantum Hall insulator.
Naively, when doping is suﬃciently high and inter-
valley scattering is neglected, one would expect the elec-
trons of each valley to behave as a 2DEG subject to
an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld with a well deﬁned direction
[Fig. 1a)]. Therefore, each valley should exhibit two edge
plasmons, one of which gapped [Fig. 1b)], with the direc-
tion of propagation of the acoustic plasmon determined
by the sign of the pseudomagnetic ﬁeld in the given val-
ley. Therefore, at low frequency one expects two counter-
propagating edge magnetoplasmons to emerge, each due
to density oscillations of one of the two electronic com-
ponents.
Unfortunately, the problem is not so simple:
even neglecting direct scattering between them, the two
valleys are always electrostatically coupled, and a den-
sity ﬂuctuation in one of them will invariably inﬂuence
the electrons in the other. This fact makes the problem
completely non-trivial and, since one of the two valleys
is always oﬀ-resonance (i.e. it experiences an eﬀective
magnetic ﬁeld with the wrong sign), it could in princi-
ple destroy the collective modes. We ﬁnd that the two
counter-propagating acoustic edge plasmons survive, but
that the valleys are not completely disentangled. Each
collective mode stems indeed from the superposition of
density oscillations in both valleys, and becomes “local-
ized” in one of them only in the limit of large pseudo-
magnetic ﬁelds. We stress again that high ﬁeld values

Panel a) a schematic view of the theoretical model:
the two electronic components experience opposite pseudo-
magnetic ﬁelds. In the case of graphene this is achieved by
strain, which acts as an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld with oppo-
site signs for the electrons in the two valleys (K and K′).
Two counter-propagating plasmons appear at the edge of the
system, each of them mainly due to density oscillations in
a speciﬁc valley.

of the particle-hole continuum (shaded region). The second

are actually attainable in experiments.
A similar situation occurs when electrons travel in
proximity to a Skyrmion crystal realized, e.g., in a chiral
magnet. The complex, topological magnetic structure is
responsible for the emergence of an “eﬀective electrody-
namics” determined by the Berry phases accumulated by
the electrons moving in it.29 Traveling in such a structure
the electron spin tends to adiabatically align with the di-
rection of the magnetization. At suitable electronic den-
sities, spin-up electrons accumulate a Berry phase which
has a sign opposite to that of spin-down electrons.30 As
a consequence, the two spin populations “skew” in op-
posite directions. In this case the pseudomagnetic ﬁeld
(∼2.5 T in MnSi29) originates from the Berry phase
accumulated by electrons passing through the complex
magnetic structure: this system oﬀers therefore a beau-
tiful model to study the impact of the (real-space) Berry
phase on collective modes.
In this letter we solve the edge-plasmon problem in a
two-component 2D electronic system subject to a pseudo-
magnetic ﬁeld. We solve the full Wiener-Hopf problem31
deﬁned by constitutive equations and electrostatics, and
we provide a comparison with an approximate solution `a
la Fetter.

graphene sheet which occupies the half plane x < 0, z = 0

oscillations comes from electrons in valley K, and only 20%
from those living around the K′ point. For the left-moving

shape of the applied strain is such that ∇× A = ±B ˆz,
where the pseudomagnetic ﬁeld B is constant, while the
plus (minus) sign applies to electrons in valley K (K′).
Even though the strain ﬁeld must have a trigonal symme-
try to induce a constant pseudomagnetic ﬁeld,25–27 we as-
sume that the curvature of the edge is negligible, and we
treat it as a straight line. We neglect inter-valley scatter-
ing, assume graphene to be in the Fermi-liquid regime,22
and we study the electronic transport by means of lin-
earized hydrodynamic equations.32–34 The electron den-

Since the translational invariance along the ˆy direction
is not broken, all functions have a dependence of the
form e−i(ωt−qy).
Eqs. (2)-(4) constitute a system of
integro-diﬀerential equations that can be solved using
the Wiener-Hopf technique.31 We calculate the sound
velocity of the two counter-propagating edge pseudo-
magnetoplasmons.
Furthermore, we show that in the
limit B →∞the two valleys decouple and each collective
mode is due to density oscillations of only one of them.
Fetter20 simpliﬁed the problem by introducing an ap-
proximation of Eq. (4), replacing it with

. (5)
The big advantage of Eq. (5) is that, while leaving intact
the ﬁrst two moments of the interaction potential inte-
grated across the edge, it allows to study a system of or-
dinary linear diﬀerential equations. However, eﬀects that
depend on the long range of the interaction along the edge
are in this way lost. Note indeed that the asymptotic be-
havior of Eq. (5) in the limit q →0 is completely diﬀerent
from that of the Fourier transform of Eq. (4). Below, we
compare our exact results with those obtained with the
approximation (5). We stress that the solution obtained
with the Wiener-Hopf method in not just an incremental
improvement of Fetter’s result, but reveals features miss-
ing in the approximate result. Namely, (i) the logarith-
mic divergence of the plasmon velocity at small momenta
due to the long-range nature of the Coulomb interac-
tion,21 and (ii) the absence of gapped modes with energy
below ℏωc. The details of the calculation in the approxi-
mate model, which closely parallels Fetter’s derivation,20
are given in the Supplemental Online Material.

THE WIENER-HOPF SOLUTION
To solve the problem posed by Eqs. (2)-(4), we ﬁrst
introduce nsum(diﬀ)(x) ≡δnK(x) ± δnK′(x).
The re-
sulting equation for ndiﬀ(x) is independent of φ(x), and
its solution reads ndiﬀ(x) = ¯ndiﬀeκ−x, where κ−=
p
q2 + s−2(ω2c −ω2). ¯ndiﬀis a constant to be determined
from the boundary conditions.
Plugging this solution
back into Eqs. (2)-(4), and taking their one-sided Fourier
transform,31 we ﬁnd

Here we used the fact that vK,x(0) = vK′,x(0) = 0, and
we deﬁned ¯Ξ ≡nsum(0) −2en0φ(0)/(ms2). We extend k
to the whole complex plane, and we denote with the sub-
script “+” [“−”] functions that are analytic in the upper
[lower] half. The functions nsum(k) and φ(k) in Eq. (6a)
are, by construction, analytic for ℑm(k) ≥0,31 and we
therefore rename φ(k) →φ+(k) and nsum(k) →n+(k).
Analyticity requires that the numerator of Eq. (6a) van-
ishes for k = iκ−: we will make use of this condition
below to determine the plasmon dispersion. Taking the
double-sided Fourier transform of Eq. (4), noting that the
left-hand side is φ+(k) + φ−(k), and combining it with
Eq. (6a) we get
(k2 + κ2

Eq. (7) can be solved with the Wiener-Hopf technique.

The function G+(k) [G−(k)] is analytic in the upper

G+(k)φ+(k) + G−(k)φ−(k) = 2πe¯ΞF(k) G−(k)

. (9)
The term on the right-hand side of Eq. (9) can be rewrit-
ten as F(k)G−(k)/(k2 + κ2

F+(k) [F−(k)] is analytic in the upper [lower] half of the
complex plane, and reads

Eq. (9) now reads
G+(k)φ+(k) −2πeF+(k)¯Ξ = 2πeF−(k)¯Ξ −G−(k)φ−(k) .
(11)
Since the left-hand side is analytic for ℑm(k) ≥0 and the
right-hand side is analytic for ℑm(k) ≤0, together they
deﬁne a function analytic in the whole complex plane.
Moreover, both sides of Eq. (11) vanish in the limit |k| →
∞. As a consequence,31 they must be separately equal to
zero. Therefore, φ+(k) = 2πe¯ΞF+(k)/G+(k). Plugging
this back in Eq. (6a) we ﬁnally get

Since n+(k) is, by deﬁnition, analytic for ℑm(k) > 0, the
square brackets in Eq. (12) has to vanish for k = iκ−in
order to cancel the pole in the denominator. Performing
the integrals (8) and (10), setting ωp(q) = vpq, and taking
the limit q →0, from the square brackets in Eq. (12) we
get s2/v2

mensionless coupling constant, and ν the ﬁlling factor
(number of ﬁlled Landau levels). In the presence of un-
screened electron-electron interactions the integral on the
second line is infrared divergent in the limit ¯q →0. The
edge pseudo-magnetoplasmon velocity therefore diverges
as v2
p →−2¯α ln(q)/(πg).21 In the Supplemental Online
Material we solve the problem ´a-la Fetter, by replacing
Eq. (4) with Eq. (5), and we ﬁnd

(14)
A comparison between vp and the approximate result of
Eq. (14) is given in Fig. 2a). In this plot we set ¯q = 0.01.
Since the problem is symmetric for q →−q, at any
given frequency it is possible to excite two counter-
propagating plasmons.
Let us now discuss the degree
of valley polarization of such plasmons.
It is easy to
show that the two electronic components oscillate with
opposite phases.
Therefore |ndiﬀ| > |nsum|, and the
right quantities that display the degree of valley po-
larization are |δnK/ndiﬀ| and |δnK′/ndiﬀ|.
For weak
pseudomagnetic ﬁelds the two are identical, i.e.
both
valleys are involved in plasmon oscillations.
However,
in the limit B →∞one of the two valleys is com-
pletely “frozen” and the oscillations involve only the
other one.
In this case, for example, |δnK/ndiﬀ| ≃1
and |δnK′/ndiﬀ| ≃0. We derive an explicit expression
for these two quantities.
Let us ﬁrst note that when
ω = ωp(q), ¯ndiﬀ= s¯Ξ/vp [see Eq. (6b)]. The value of
nsum(x) at the boundary is instead obtained by taking
the Fourier transform of Eq. (12) in the limit x →0−.
This is shown in detail in the Supplemental Online Ma-
terial.
The resulting expressions are fairly simple, al-
though their numerical integration turns out to be quite
challenging. At the same time, the approximate model
gives nsum(0) = s2¯Ξ/v2
p which is in very good agreement
with the result obtained with the Wiener-Hopf technique
(when vp is calculated with this method). Using the ap-
proximate expression, |δnK/ndiﬀ| = (vp + s)/(2vp) and
|δnK′/¯ndiﬀ| = (vp−s)/(2vp). In Fig. 2b) we plot the two
functions for the right-propagating mode. Note that at
ν = 1 the 80% of the contribution to this plasmon comes
from the electrons of valley K, while only the 20% is due
to those around the K′ point.
Finally, it is possible to show that no other mode lives
inside the bulk-plasmon gap. Such a mode should have
a zero-momentum frequency smaller than ωc. The plas-
mon equation for gapped modes is obtained as before by
considering the term in the square brackets in Eq. (12)
and setting k = iκ−and ω = ωc∆, with 0 < ∆< 1.
It is easy to show that in the limit q →0 the resulting
equations are identical to those obtained for the acoustic
modes, when these are evaluated in the limit vp →∞and
¯α = sα/(ωc
√
1 −∆2). The plasmon equation is there-
fore a function of only ¯α, and it has no solution unless
¯α →∞(which corresponds to ∆= 1). Therefore the
gapped mode has a minimum energy equal to ℏωc.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
In this letter we have discussed the problem of col-
lective modes conﬁned at the boundaries of a two-
component 2D system subject to a pseudomagnetic ﬁeld
which preserves the time-reversal symmetry.25–27,29,30
This property is ensured by the fact that it has op-
posite signs for the two diﬀerent electron populations.
We have shown that (i) two counter-propagating acous-
tic plasmons live at the edge of the system, and that
(ii) in the limit of large pseudomagnetic ﬁeld the excited
plasmon involve only density oscillations of one of the
two electronic components. The other one is completely
“frozen”. We stress that the very same phenomenology
emerges in many diﬀerent physical systems, and therefore
the solution we provide has a wide applicability.
In graphene, the edge modes induced by shear strain
deformations25–27 are valley-polarized. They can there-
fore be used to selectively excite electrons in one of the
two valleys by, e.g., optical means, by carefully choosing
the energy and wavevector of the imparted external per-
turbation. This fact, similar to the valley-selective circu-
lar dichroism of transition metal dichalcogenides.37, has a
direct impact on the emerging ﬁeld of valleytronics.36–38

5
Furthermore, since the edge plasmon velocity depends on
the strain ﬁeld, it is possible to draw an analogy with the
propagation of light in media with diﬀerent refractive in-
dexes, and imagine to induce focusing, anti-focusing and
interference between collective modes by means of a prop-
erly chosen strain pattern.25–28
Our edge pseudo-magnetoplasmons are conceptually
diﬀerent from the edge “Berry plasmons” recently intro-
duced in Ref. 39.
The latter are driven by a pseudo-
magnetic ﬁeld in momentum space (Berry curvature)
whereas our valley-selective pseudo-magnetic ﬁeld acts
in real space, therefore opening a gap in the spectrum
of the modes propagating in the “wrong” direction. No
such gap is present in the spectrum of Berry plasmons.
Another more “exotic” example is given by electrons
traveling in a Skyrmion lattice.29,30 Our theory pre-
dicts the existence of counter-propagating spin-polarized
acoustic plasmons, which can be exploited for spintronics
applications.40–42

(A7)
The same equation holds for δnK′(x).
Note that no
approximation has been done in Eqs. (A5)-(A7), and
they are therefore valid also in the description of the
full model. A further simpliﬁcation occurs by introduc-
ing the variables δnK(x) =

δnK′(x) =

Note that Eq. (A8) is to be solved together with Eq. (A3)
[or its approximate counterpart (A4)]. On the contrary,
ndiﬀ(x) satisﬁes a diﬀerential equation which is indepen-
dent of φ(x), and therefore it is exact whether or not the
approximation (A4) is considered. Its solution is given
by

Appendix B: The Wiener-Hopf solution

them over x between −∞and 0 with the weight e−ikx,

We now extend k to the whole complex plane, and we rename φ(k) →φ+(k) and nsum(k) →n+(k), where the “+”
sign stands for the fact that the function is analytic in the upper-half of the complex plane. Recall indeed that
Eq. (B3) was obtained by Fourier transforming over x between −∞and 0, and therefore the functions nsum(k) and
φ(k) that appear there are by deﬁnition analytic for ℑm(k) > 0 .We complement Eq. (B4) with the Fourier transform
of Eq. (A3). We get

The function G+(k) [G−(k)] is analytic in the upper

Note that here F(k) is deﬁned diﬀerently with respect to

G+(k)φ+(k) −2πeF+(k)¯Ξ =
2πeF−(k)¯Ξ −G−(k)φ−(k) .
(B12)
Since the left-hand side is analytic for ℑm(k) ≥0 and the
right-hand side is analytic for ℑm(k) ≤0, together they
deﬁne a function analytic in the whole complex plane.
Since both sides have to vanish in the limit |k| →∞, we
get
φ+(k) = 2πe F+(k)

Using Eq. (B11) we can now split the second line of
Eq. (C2) in the sum of two functions, one analytic in the
upper half of the complex plane and the other analytic
in its lower half. We identify them with ∂k ˜G+(k)/ ˜G+(k)
and −∂k ˜G−(k)/ ˜G−(k), respectively. Furthermore, since
the function ∂k ln ˜G(k) is odd in k,

To avoid the pole z = k + iη, we close the contour in
the lower half of the complex plane, circulating in the
clockwise direction. The contour excludes the branch cut
of the square root, which runs from z = −iq to z = −i∞.
Note that the denominator of the last line on Eq. (C4) has
no poles thanks to properties of the square root, namely
that it changes sign on the two sides of the branch cut.

Appendix D: The ratio ¯nsum/¯ndiﬀ
We ﬁrst observe that, according to the second line of
Eq. (B3), ¯ndiﬀ= ¯Ξc−1, in the limit q →0. To calculate
¯nsum we have to consider the Fourier transform of n+(k),
given by Eq. (B14), in the limit x →0−. This implies
that the contour of integration is to be closed in the lower
half of the complex plane, where the functions F+(k)
and G+(k) have branch cuts. Prior to performing the
Fourier transform of n+(k), it is convenient to rewrite
F+(k) = F(k) + F (1)(k), where (hereafter, to simplify
the results, we neglect contributions that would vanish
in the limit q →0)

The
set
of
diﬀerential
equations
given
by
Eqs.
(A4),
(A8)
and
(A9)
can
be
easily
solved.
We look for a solution of the form nsum(x) = ¯nsumeκ+x
and φ(x) = ¯φeκ+x, and we set to zero the determinant
of the resulting linear system. Therefore

(E1)
where Ω2
q = 2πe2n0q/m is the bulk plasmon frequency
at zero magnetic ﬁeld. Eq. (E1) has two solutions, which
we denote by κ+,1 and κ+,2. We write the solution of the
system of diﬀerential equations as
φ(x) = ¯φ1eκ+,1x + ¯φ2eκ+,2x ,
(E2)
and
nsum(x) = (κ2
+,1 −2q2)¯φ1
4πeq
eκ+,1x
+ (κ2
+,2 −2q2)¯φ2
4πeq
eκ+,2x ,
(E3)
and we impose the boundary conditions to ﬁnd an equa-
tion for κ+,1 and κ+,2, which, together with Eq. (E1), al-
lows us to determine the edge plasmon frequencies. Such
boundary conditions are given by (i) the continuity of
the potential and (ii) of its derivative, and the vanishing
of (iii) vK,x and (iv) vK′,x at the boundary x = 0. The
potential for x > 0 is given by φ(x) = ¯φ0e−
√
2qx, while
all other functions of course vanish. The boundary condi-
tions form a system of four linear homogeneous equations
in the four unknowns ¯φ0, ¯φ1, ¯φ2, and ¯ndiﬀ. This system
has a non-trivial solution if its determinant is zero, i.e.
if

(E4)
Once Eq. (E1) has been solved and the resulting κ+,1 and
κ+,2, together with κ−, have been plugged into Eq. (E4),
we can look for a low-energy solution of the form ω = cq.
Expanding Eq. (E4) for small q, and setting the coeﬃ-
cient of the lowest term of the Taylor expansion to zero
we ﬁnd
c = s
s
1 + 2
√
22πe2n0
msωc
.
(E5)
it is now interesting to study the density distribution for
this mode. Plugging ω = cq, with c given by Eq. (E5),
into Eqs. (A10), (E2) and (E3) we ﬁnd that, in the limit
ωc →∞and q →0, ¯φ1 = 0, κ2,+ = κ−= ωc/s, and
nsum(x) = ¯ndiﬀeωcx/s ,
ndiﬀ(x) = ¯ndiﬀeωcx/s ,
(E6)
and therefore δnK′(x) = 0 and δnK(x) ̸= 0.
There-
fore, the edge plasmon contains only the contribution of
the electron in valley K. Reversing the sign of ωc (or
considering the plasmon with negative group velocity)
we would get an edge plasmon whose contribution comes
mainly from valley K′.
