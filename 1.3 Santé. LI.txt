Selective reporting of findings from scientific 
research is a long-known phenomenon
• In the 17th century, Francis Bacon noted 
that “The human intellect …is more moved 
by affirmatives than by negatives.”
• Robert Boyle, the chemist, lamented the 
common tendency among scientists not to 
publish their results until they had a 
“system” worked out, with the result that 
“many excellent notions or experiments are, 
by sober and modest men, suppressed.”

Dickersin 2010

“A negative result may be dull but often it is no less important than the positive; and in view of 
that importance it must, surely, be established by adequate publication of the evidence.” 
- Austin Bradford Hill 1956
“A positive result is exciting and interesting and gets published quickly. A negative result, or one 
which is inconsistent with current opinion, is either unexciting or attributed to some error and is 
not published. So that at first in the case of a new therapy there is a clustering toward positive 
results with fewer negative results being published. Then some brave or naïve or nonconformist 
soul, like the little child who said that the emperor had no clothes, comes up with a negative 
result which he dares to publish. That starts the pendulum swinging in the other direction, and 
now negative results become popular and important.” 
- Seymour Kety 1959

Types of reporting biases
Reporting bias arises when 
the dissemination of research is influenced 
by the nature and direction of findings.
• Not reporting studies at all (also known as 
non-publication bias)
• Reporting studies in part
• Reporting in a manner that is difficult for 
others to access
• Reporting without transparency (duplicate 
publication, spin)

Not reporting studies 
(non-publication bias)
• Analysis of inception cohorts of studies 
approved by research ethics committees 
or included in trial registries 
• Between 45%-60% of randomized 
trials were published
• Nearly 3 times more likely to be 
published if results were statistically 
significant

Not reporting trials - consequences
• Unscientific:
altered evidence 
on the benefit 
and harms of 
reboxetine
• Unethical: 
breached 
participant trust 
• Uninformative: 
constituted 
research waste
Eyding 2010

Reporting trials in part
Outcome reporting bias manifests in different 
forms when reporting of the outcomes is 
influenced by the nature and direction of 
findings:
• Not reporting pre-specified outcomes
• Reporting primary outcome as secondary 
outcome (and vice versa) 
• Introducing new outcomes
• Reporting outcomes such that they are 
differentially accessible

No cherry picking

Outcome reporting bias in industry-sponsored 
trials of gabapentin for off-label use
• Comparison of protocol to publication for statement of “primary” 
outcome
• 21 primary outcomes ‘pre-specified’ in the protocol
•
11 reported with no changes
•
10 not reported or reported as secondary outcomes
•
17 new primary outcomes added (some were secondary 
outcomes in protocol)
• 28 primary outcomes in ‘main’ publication

• Statistically significant outcomes were more likely to be reported in full
• Efficacy outcomes: 2.2-2.7 times greater odds
• Harm outcomes: 4.7 times greater odds
• 40–62% of studies had at least one primary outcome changed, newly 
introduced, or omitted, when trial publications were compared with protocols

Dwan 2013

Reporting in a manner that is difficult 
for others to access
• A systematic review of 425 studies (307,028 
abstracts) discovered that only 37.3% were 
subsequently published in full (59.8% for 
randomized trials)
• “Significant” results were 1.31 times more 
likely to published in full
• “Positive” results, defined as a result 
favoring the experimental treatment, were 
1.17 times more likely to be published in full

Researchers
Editors
Peer reviewers
•
Researchers failed to submit trial results for publication was the primary reason 
for unpublished clinical trials (“not interested in the results” and “lack of time”)
•
Researchers’ perception that positive results are favored by editors (outcome 
reporting bias), and unawareness of the seriousness of under-reporting 

Addressing 
reporting biases
• Trial registration and 
results database
• Data sharing
• Access to study 
documents
• Reporting guidelines
• Core outcome sets

Access to study documents
Public access to protocols (including statistical analysis plan) and clinical 
study reports is essential for preserving the societal value of clinical trials.

Why share your research data?
The move towards clinical trial data sharing is 
part of a wider movement towards open science:
• Increase scientific value
• Moral obligations
• Funders’ mandate
• Journals’ requirement

Conclusions
• Reporting of biomedical research is biased when it is influenced by 
the nature and direction of their findings.
• Reporting biases can take many forms.
• Reporting biases typically result in spurious exaggeration of 
beneficial effects and suppression of harmful effects of interventions.
• Clinical trial registration, access to protocols and statistical analysis 
plans, guidelines for transparent and complete reporting, adoption of 
core outcome sets, and data sharing are critical to prevent reporting 
biases.
