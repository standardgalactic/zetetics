Preface 
The purpose of this book is to provide a nonmathematical introduction to the 
LISREL computer program (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1985). It was written with 
a very specific audience in mind-those wishing to use the LISREL program, 
but who, so far, have been frightened off by its seemingly complex notation, 
mathematical concepts, and overall statistical headiness. Since I too am a victim 
of math anxiety, symbol shock, and other related phobias, I know only too well, 
the frustration of trying to translate mathematical jargon into plain and simple 
everyday language. The book is therefore written not for the mathematically 
sophisticated, but rather, for those who seek a more earthly approach to the 
topic. 
After some eight years of finding my way through the LISREL forest that 
included the previous program versions IV and V, and after asking innumerable 
questions regarding its use, I wish now to share what knowledge I have on appli-
cations of LISREL with my fellow math phobics. As with other life experiences, 
some are best learned by doing: nowhere is this more true than in learning to 
use LISREL. By providing concrete applications, along with accompanying data 
and important caveats regarding the LISREL program, I hope to save you from 
the trial-and-error approach that characterized much of my own learning of the 
program. 
The focus of the book is not on the theoretical or statistical framework of 
LISREL. Indeed, there are now many well-written texts on the topic of LISREL 
modeling in general, and many excellent journal articles on particular problems 
related to it. Rather, the emphasis is on the practical aspect of LISREL model-
ing. As such, the new user is "walked through" a variety of LISREL applica-
tions; all are based on the confirmatory factor analytic model. 
All application examples in the book are taken from my own research in the 
area of self-concept. I chose this approach for several reasons. First, it maxi-
mized my freedom to make the data available to you for your own experimenta-
tion with the program. I urge you to work through each application using these 
data. Second, it enabled me to provide you with specific journal references to 
which you may tum should you wish further elaboration of the underlying the-
ory, measuring instruments, sample description, and the like. Finally, it pro-

viii 
Preface 
vided me with detailed information regarding problems encountered at various 
stages of the data analyses. The value here comes from learning how to solve 
the problem; I pass this information along to you with each selected application. 
While these applications derive from a psychological perspective, it should be 
emphasized that all are equally applicable to any of the other social or behavioral 
sciences. 
The book is divided into three major sections. In Section I, I introduce the 
reader/user first to basic concepts associated with the LISREL model (Chapter 
1), and then to the basic components of the LISREL program (Chapter 2). Sec-
tion II focuses on single-group analyses; I present applications related to the 
validation of a theoretical construct (Chapter 3), a measuring instrument (Chap-
ter 4), and multiple constructs assessed by multiple measures within the frame-
work of the multi trait-multi method matrix (Chapter 5). Finally, in Section III, I 
examine applications that relate to mUltigroup analyses. Specifically, I demon-
strate procedures for testing the measurement and structural invariance of a theo-
retical construct (Chapter 6), a measuring instrument (Chapter 7), and latent 
mean structures (Chapter 8). 
With each application, I provide data in correlation matrix form, along with 
means and standard deviations; a schematic presentation of the model being 
tested; the specific LISREL program input; a discussion of results in terms of 
goodness-of-fit and post hoc procedures; and the related journal reference where 
the theoretical framework, methodology, and substantive findings are described 
and discussed in more detail. Elsewhere, I present and interpret selected portions 
of the LISREL output, point out the causes of and solutions to particular error 
messages, and offer helpful caveats related to particular LISREL functions. 
Acknowledgments. I wish to express my indebtedness to several people who are 
directly responsible for my persistent interest in the application of LISREL to 
various models of psychological phenomena. To Richard J. Shavelson, without 
whose continued encouragement over nearly a decade that spans the early days 
of my doctoral research up to the present, the contents of this book would never 
have come into being; to Rich lowe much more than I can ever hope to repay. 
Although initially he knew me only as a signature on a letter requesting more 
information on a proposed structural model to validate self-concept (Shavelson 
& Stuart, 1981), he took the time to write and encourage me in my doctoral 
work, convincing me that my research represented a worthy contribution to the 
field. More recently, as a post-doctoral fellow at UCLA, where I had the good 
fortune to collaborate with him on further validation of self-concept using LIS-
REL applications, he taught me other important skills essential to good research: 
clear thinking, succinct writing, and thorough analyses. In my view, Rich Sha-
vel son is the epitome of both teacher and researcher par excellence; he will for-
ever be an inspiration to me in my academic endeavors! 
To Bengt Muthen who, during my tenure at UCLA (and many times since), 
has answered innumerable questions, provided invaluable advice, and taught me

the importance of knowing my data well; his patience, I'm certain, has been 
tried on many occasions when explanations have required translation into non-
mathematical terms that I could understand. To David Kaplan who, during my 
time at UCLA, helped me resolve a multiplicity of LISREL anomalies, and with 
whom I enjoyed sparring about the goodness-of-fit of LISREL models based on 
"real" versus "unreal" data. To Herbert W. Marsh whose plethora of self-
concept papers, many of which have involved LISREL applications, have con-
stantly challenged me to learn more. To James E. Carlson, who during the period 
of my doctoral research, guided me through my first LISREL experiences back 
in the days of LISREL IV when finding "start values" was akin to looking for 
a needle in a haystack. To Lee Wolfle, who provided me with the first explana-
tion of LISREL symbols and matrices that I could actually understand; his 1981 
AERA paper will forever remain a prized possession in my collection of LISREL 
papers. And finally, to Peter Bentler whose papers and oral presentations have 
provided me with a wealth of invaluable information; I can only hope to aspire 
to his consummate interpretative and literary skills.

Section I Introduction

The LISREL ConfIrmatory Factor 
Analytic (CFA) Model 
1. Basic Concepts 
1.1. The Role of Latent and Observed Variables 
In the social and behavioral sciences, researchers are often interested in 
studying theoretical constructs that cannot be observed directly; such 
phenomena are termed latent variables, or factors. (Throughout the 
book, the terms "construct," "latent variable," and "factor" are used 
interchangeably). Examples of latent variables in psychology are self-
concept and anxiety; in sociology, powerlessness and racial prejudice; in 
education, teacher expectancy and verbal ability; in economics, eco-
nomic expectation and social class. 
Since latent variables are not directly observed, they cannot be directly 
measured. Thus, the researcher must operationally define the latent vari-
able of interest in terms of behavior believed to represent it. Assessment 
of the construct, then, is obtained indirectly through measurement of 
some observed behavior. The term "behavior" is used here in its broad-
est sense to include scores on a particular measuring instrument. Thus, 
observations may include, for example, self-report responses to an atti-
tude scale, scores on an achievement test, in vivo observation scores re-
lated to some physical task or activity, coded response to interview ques-
tions, and the like. These measured scores (Le., measurements) are 
termed observed, manifest, or indicator variables; they are considered to 
represent the underlying construct of interest. 
It is now easy to see why methodologists urge researchers to be cau-
tious in their selection of measuring instruments, and emphasize choosing 
only those that are psychometrically sound. To do otherwise runs the risk 
of limiting the credibility of the findings. 
1.2. The Role of Factor Analysis 
The most well-known statistical procedure for investigating relations be-
tween a set of observed variables and its underlying constructs is that of 

4 
1. The LisreI Confirmatory Factor Analytic (CF A) Model 
factor analysis. In using this approach to data analyses, the researcher 
studies the covariation among the observed variables in order to gather 
information on a (usually) smaller number of latent variables. 
There are two basic types of factor analyses: exploratory factor analy-
sis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In EFA, the re-
searcher does hot know the underlying latent variable structure. Thus, 
the focus of the investigation is directed toward uncovering the minimal 
number of factors that underlie the observed variables. In CF A, on the 
other hand, the researcher has some knowledge of the underlying latent 
variable structure. This knowledge may be based on theory, empirical 
research, or some combination of both. For example, suppose a measur-
ing instrument is designed to measure four facets of self-concept (say, 
general, academic, physical, and social), and this factor structure has 
been validated in the literature. The researcher can feel confident in pro-
ceeding with a CFA analysis. As such, he or she postulates a priori that 
certain test items will be highly related to the latent variables they are 
designed to measure, and only negligibly related (or, better still, not re-
lated at all) to the remaining factors. In factor analysis, these relations 
are termed factor loadings. Thus we say that the items will load highly 
on those factors for which they were designed to measure and will load 
negligibly on the other factors. Putting this in context with our example 
of self-concept; the researcher would specify a priori that the items de-
signed to measure general self-concept would load highly on that factor 
but would yield loadings of approximately zero on the academic, physi-
cal, and social self-concept factors. 
While EFA can be conducted using LISREL, it is most commonly con-
ducted using a more traditional approach that can be accomplished by 
using other statistical packages, such as SPSS, SPSSX, SAS, and BMDP. 
On the other hand, CF A requires the analysis of covariance structures 
that is the basis of the LISREL approach to data analysis. I This book 
therefore limits itself to applications that fall within the CF A framework. 
1.3. The Role of Statistical Models 
Statistical models are a convenient way of describing the structure under-
lying a set of observed variables. In other words, they provide the sim-
plest explanation of how the observed and latent variables are related to 
one another. Most people think of statistical models as being geometric 
schema portraying specific phenomena under study, but this is not always 
the case; indeed, such diagrams are a very convenient and effective way 
of getting the idea across. However, statistical models can also be de-
IOther available computer programs designed for the analysis of covariance struc-
tures are EQS (Bentler, 1985) and COSAN (McDonald, 1978) for use with interval 
data, and LISCOMP (Muthen, 1987) and PRELIS (Joreskog & SorbOm, 1986) for 
use with categorical data. 

2. The General LISREL Model 
5 
scribed by means of mathematical equations that can be expressed either 
in matrix or regression format; the latter is a series of regression equa-
tions, each of which represents the relation between one observed vari-
able and its underlying latent variable. 
Typically, a researcher postulates a statistical model based on his or 
her knowledge of the related theory, on findings from other research con-
ducted in the area, or on some combination of both. The researcher then 
sets out to test the model (i.e., test the hypothesis that the model is plausi-
ble) by collecting data on all variables specified in the model. The primary 
statistical problem in this model-testing procedure is to examine the 
goodness-of-fit between the hypothesized model and the sample data that 
comprise the observed measurements. Said another way, the researcher 
imposes structure on the sample data by forcing them to fit the hypothe-
sized model and then determines how well the observed data fit the model 
under study. Since it is highly unlikely that a perfect fit will exist between 
the observed data and the hypothesized model, there will be a differential 
between the two; this differential is termed the residual. 
The model-fitting process can be summarized as follows: 
Data = Model + Residual 
where 
*Data represent the observed measurements based on the sample. 
*Model represents the hypothesized structure underlying the observed 
variables. 
*Residual represents the difference between the hypothesized model and 
the observed data. 
The statistical theory related to this model-fitting process can be found 
in the many texts and journal articles devoted to the topic of LISREL 
modeling. 
2. The General LISREL Model 
In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the CFA model, it 
behooves us at this point to first examine the general LISREL model. 
This diversion is necessary for two reasons: it will help you to more fully 
comprehend how the CF A model fits into the general LISREL scheme of 
things and it will facilitate the later understanding of analyses related to 
mean structures discussed in Section 3. 
2.1. Basic Composition 
The general LISREL model can be decomposed into two submodels: a 
measurement model and a structural model. The measurement model de-
fines relations between the observed and unobserved variables. In other 
words, it provides the link between scores on the measuring instruments 

6 
I. The Lisrel Confirmatory Factor Analytic (CF A) Model 
(i.e., observed indicator variables), and the underlying constructs they 
are designed to measure (i.e., the unobserved latent variables). The mea-
surement model, then, specifies the pattern by which each measure loads 
onto a particular factor. The structural model defines relations among the 
unobserved variables. In other words, it specifies which latent variable(s) 
directly or indirectly influences (i.e., "causes") changes in the values of 
other latent variables in the model. 
One necessary requirement in working with LISREL is that, in specify-
ing the structural model, the researcher distinguishes between latent vari-
ables that are exogenous and those that are endogenous. Exogenous la-
tent variables are synonymous with independent variables; they cause 
fluctuations in the values of other latent variables in the model. Fluctua-
tion in the values of exogenous variables is not explained by the model; 
rather, they are considered to be influenced by other factors external to 
the model. Background variables such as sex, age, and socioeconomic 
status are examples of such external factors. Endogenous variables are 
synonymous with dependent variables; they are influenced (i.e., 
"caused") by the exogenous variables in the model, either directly or 
indirectly. Fluctuation in the values of endogenous variables is said to be 
explained by the model since all latent variables that influence them are 
included in the model specification.2 
2.2. The Link Between Greek and LISREL 
In the Joreskog tradition, LISREL models are couched in matrix notation 
that is represented by Greek letters. Thus, a second necessary require-
ment in learning to work with LISREL, is to become thoroughly familiar 
with the various LISREL matrices and the Greek letters that represent 
them. 
In general, matrices are represented by upper-case Greek letters. The 
elements of these matrices are indicated by lower-case Greek letters; they 
represent the parameters in the model. By convention, observed mea-
sures are represented by Roman letters. As such, exogenous variables 
are termed "X-variables"; endogenous variables are termed "Y-vari-
abies." At the most, eight matrices and four vectors define a general LIS-
REL model.3 All matrices and vectors, however, may not necessarily be 
required; this will depend on the particular model specified. 
The measurement model is defined by four matrices and one vector; 
the structural model by four matrices and three vectors. As such, the 
2Although beyond the scope of this volume, it should be noted that in more com-
plex general LISREL models, it is often the case that latent variables operate as 
exogenous and endogenous variables within the same model. 
3 A matrix represents a series of numbers written in rows and columns; each num-
ber in the matrix is termed an element. A vector is a special matrix case, having 
more than one row, albeit only one column. 

2. The General LISREL Model 
7 
measurement model is composed of two regression matrices, two vari-
ance-covariance matrices among errors of measurement, and one vector 
representing the endogenous factor. 
The structural model comprises two regression matrices, two variance-
covariance matrices (one among the exogenous factors and one among 
the residual errors associated with the endogenous factors), and three 
vectors representing the exogenous variables, endogenous variables, and 
errors associated with the endogenous variables, respectively. An expla-
nation of these matrices is now presented. 
The Measurement Model 4 
I.Ax is a p by m regression matrix that relates m exogenous factors to 
each of the p observed variables designed to measure them. 
2.A y is a q by n regression matrix that relates n endogenous factors to 
each of the q observed measures designed to measure them. 
3.8& is a symmetricalp by p variance-covariance matrix among the errors 
of measurement for the p exogenous observed variables. 
4.8~is a symmetrical q by q variance-covariance matrix among the errors 
of ineasurement for the q endogenous observed variables. 
5.v is an n by I vector of constant intercept terms.5 
The Structural Model 
I.r is an m by n regression matrix that relates the m exogenous factors 
to the n endogenous factors. 
2.B is an n by n regression matrix that relates the n endogenous factors 
to one another. 
3.eI> is an m by m symmetrical variance-covariance matrix among the m 
exogenous factors. 
4. "I' is an n by n symmetrical variance-covariance matrix among the n 
residual errors for the n endogenous factors. 6 
5.~ is an m by I vector of exogenous factors. 
6.TJ is an n by I vector of endogenous factors. 
7.' is an n by I vector of residuals. 
Note: in the general model, LISREL does not permit a priori specification 
of variances and covariances among the endogenous factors; no variance-
covariance matrix is therefore identified here. This does not reflect a limi-
tation in the LISREL program; rather, it is inherent in the model's mathe-
maticallogic. 
4By convention, matrices are defined according to their number of rows (r) and 
columns (c); the number of rows is always specified first. This r x c description 
of a matrix is termed the order of the matrix. 
5We need only concern ourselves with this vector when testing for differences in 
mean structures (see Chapter 8). Otherwise, v is assumed to equal zero. 
~hese residual terms are referred to as errors in the equation or as residual errors 
of prediction; the term "residual" is used to distinguish them from errors of mea-
surement associated with the observed variables.

3. The LISREL CF A Model 
3.1. A Comprehensive Explanation of the CFA Model 
Specification of the CF A model involves only a portion of the general 
LISREL model noted earlier. Furthermore, it is specified either as being 
exogenous or endogenous; this choice is an arbitrary one:7 However, 
once the model is specified as one or the other, all components of the 
model must be consistent with this specification. In other words, with a 
CFA model, the researcher works either with an all-X (exogenous) or all-
y (endogenous) model. In hypothesizing a CFA model, the researcher 
makes specifications with respect to each of the following: 
(a)The number of factors (~s or TIs). 
(b)The number of observed variables (Xs or Ys). 
(c) Relations between the observed variables and the latent factors (>"xs 
or >..yS). 
7This distinction is made here for purposes of simplicity and clarity only. Techni-
cally speaking, in CF A models there is no designation of variables as either exoge-
nous or endogenous since there is no specification of causal relations among the 
latent variables; consequently, " the residual error term associated with the pre-
diction of 1] from ~, is zero. This accounts for the freedom on the part of the 
researcher to elect usage of one or the other model.

To get a visible perspective of the CF A model relative to the general 
model, let's examine Figure 1.1. 
A third requirement in learning to use LISREL is to understand the 
geometric symbolism depicted in schematic models. The symbols used in 
Figure 1.1 are defined here.

• Observed variables. 
• Regression paths from the LV s to their observed 
variables; their coefficients (As) are synonymous 
with factor loadings. 
• Measurement error associated with the observed 
variables. 
• Causal impact of ~ on 11. 
• Residual error in the prediction of 11 from ~. 
Within the framework of the model in Figure 1.1, we see two CF A 
models-one exogenous (X-model) and one endogenous (Y-model). The 
CFAX-model is a one-factor model measured by three observed vari-
ables, while the CF A Y -model is a one-factor model measured by two 
observed variables. In either case, the factor, its regression on the ob-
served variables, and the errors of measurement are of primary interest

3.2. A Formal Explanation of the LISREL CFA Model 
In Section 1.3 we learned that statistical models can be expressed in two 
basic formats: diagrammatic or equation. Furthermore, the equation for-
mat can be expressed either in matrix form or as a series of regression 
statements. Let's now reexamine the CFA model within the framework 
of each of these formats using a simple two-factor model. To provide you 
with a thorough understanding of all matrices and their elements, this 
model will be expressed first as an all-X model, and then as an all-Y 
model since examples of both are found in the literature. 
Suppose that we have a two-factor model of self-concept: Let the two factors be 
general self-concept (GSC) and academic self-concept (ASC). Suppose that each 
factor has two observed variables: Let the two measures of GSC be the General 
Self sub scale of the Self Description Questionnaire (SDQGSC; Marsh & O'Neill, 
1984), and the Self-esteem Scale (SESGSC; Rosenberg, 1965). Let the two mea-
sures of ASC be the Academic Self-concept subscale of the Self Description Ques-
tionnaire (SDQASC) and the Self-concept of Ability Scale (SCAASC); Brook-
over, 1962).

3. The LISREL CFA Model 
11 
A schematic presentation of this model is shown in Figure 1.2. Here, 
then, we have a two-factor model consisting of GSC and ASC, with each 
factor being measured by two observed variables. The observed mea-
sures for GSC are SDQGSC and SESGSC; for ASC they are SDQASC 
and SCAASC. The curved two-headed arrow indicates that GSC and 
ASC are correlated. 
Now, let's translate this model into LISREL notation and reexamine it 
in terms of a schematic presentation and in terms of a set of equations. 
We'll look first at the all-X model. 
(a) Expressed in schematic form (as in Figure 1.3), ~I and ~2 represent 
GSC and ASC, respectively; the curved arrow indicates that they are 
correlated. All and A21 represent the regression of ~I on XI and X 2 , re-
spectively; similarly, A32 and A42 represent the regression of ~2 on X3 
and X 4 , respectively. XI and X 2 represent SDQGSC and SESGSC, the 
observed measures of GSC; X3 and X 4 represent SDQASC and 
SCAASC, the observed measures of ASC. 51 to 54 represent errors of 
measurement associated with SDQGSC to SCAASC, respectively. 
(b)Expressed in equation form: 
(i) As a series of regression equations, Figure 1.4 holds. 
(ii) In matrix form, Figure 1.5 holds.

As presented in Figure 1.5, both the number of factors (~s) and the 
measurement errors (8s) are expressed as vectors. In the analysis of the 
CFA model, however, these parameters are estimated in the appropriate 
variance-covariance matrix. The expansion of this equation is presented

3.3. Additional Points of Explanation 
I.By convention, the numbering of matrix elements is such that the first 
number represents the row, while the second represents the column. 
Thus <PZI indicates an element in the second row, first column of the 
matrix <1>. 
2.The A matrix is often referred to as the factor-loading matrix because 
it demonstrates the pattern of how each observed variable is linked to 
each factor. For example, All and A21 indicate that the first two elements 
in the regression matrix represent XI andX2 , respectively, and that both 
load on Factor 1 (GSC); the two zeros in the same column indicate that 
no other variables load on Factor 1.8 Of course the reverse pattern holds 
for Factor 2. 
3.Recall from Section 2.2 that the factor variance-covariance matrix for 
the ~s was identified as the <I> matrix. Thus, while the vector of ~s indi-
cated that there were two factors, the variance for these factors (<PII' 
<P22) and the covariance between them (<P21) represent elements in the <I> 
matrix.9 
4.Recall from Section 2.2 that the error variance-covariance matrix for 
the 8s was the 8 8 matrix. Thus, the error variances are represented by 
68 to 68 , respectively. One assumption underlying the CF A model is 
1 
4 
that errors of measurement are assumed to be uncorrelated; the zeros 
therefore indicate that no parameters representing error covariances 
will be estimated. More details regarding assumptions will be addressed 
in Chapter 2. 
5.Recall from Section 2.2 that the variance-covariance matrix for the re-
sidual terms m was identified as 'II in the general model. However, 
since the CF A model does not include causal relations between ~ and 
'Tj, the two latent factors, the residual is reduced to zero. Thus, correla-
tions among the latent factors in the all-Y model ('Tjs) are estimated in 
the'll matrix. 
Let's now examine the same two-factor model expressed as an all-Y 
model 
(a) Expressed in schematic form, it would look like Figure 1.7. 
8Note that if this had been a one-factor model, the A and <I> matrices would have 
been expressed as vectors. 
9Had no correlation been specified between the two factors (i.e., they were 
considered to be orthogonal), the <1>21 would have been specified as zero-
[

o 
<1>22.

4. Summary 
This chapter provided a basic working knowledge of LISREL symbols 
and modeling procedures. An explanation of basic concepts related to 
LISREL modeling was presented first; these included the distinction be-
tween observed and latent variables, the underlying purposes of statisti-
cal modeling in general, and factor analytic modeling in particular. The 
composition of the general LISREL model was presented next, with the 
components of the model being presented both mathematically and sche-
matically; related LISREL notation was introduced. Finally, a detailed 
explanation of the LISREL CF A model was demonstrated with both all-
X and all-Y model specifications. 

2 
Using the LISREL Program 
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to the general format of 
the LISREL program. Expanded comments regarding various aspects of 
the input and output will be addressed in subsequent chapters that focus 
on specific CFA model applications. Since this book is intended only as 
a guide to using LISREL, it is limited to applications based on maximum 
likelihood estimation. For applications based on other models and/or use 
of other estimation techniques, the reader should refer to the LISREL 
manual. In general, however, the reader is encouraged to use this book 
in conjunction with the LISREL manual to ensure a thorough understand-
ing of the link between CF A modeling and the LISREL program. 
The basic elements of the LISREL program are now outlined. We will 
first examine specifications regarding the input of information and then 
we will review the information provided on a standard output. 
LISREL Input 
1. Basic Rules 
1.1. Keywords 
The LISREL program is controlled by two-letter keywords that represent 
both card and parameter names. Although these names may contain any 
number of letters, only the first two are recognized by LISREL; all key-
words are separated by spaces or commas. 
1.2. Control Cards 
In order for the LISREL program to run, it must be provided with data, 
along with four important pieces of information: title of problem run, data 
specification (i.e., description of data being entered), model specification 
(i.e., description of model to by analyzed), and output specification (i.e., 
type of information desired). This information is provided through four 
basic control cards that must be included for every problem run; these 
are as follows: 

3. Data Specification 
17 
1. Title card. 
2. DAta card. 
3. Madel card. 
4. OUtput card. 
The capitalized letters for each card represent the required keywords. 
Except for the TI card, additional information is required within each of 
the other categories in order to complete the specification requirements. 
This information is provided by parameter specifications and additional 
control cards. These four control cards require a fixed input position, as 
listed earlier. 
Now let's examine, in more detail, each of these four major control 
cards, their parameters, and supplementary control cards. For simplicity, 
examples of input setups will be based on the model presented in Chapter 
1 (see Figure 1.2); the sample size is arbitrarily chosen to be 400. 
2. Problem Run Specification 
The first card for each problem run must specify a title for the problem; 
this is specified on the TI control card. Although there can be more than 
one card (Le., more than one line) of input, most users find it convenient 
to limit the title to less than 79 characters (i.e., 79 columns); column 80 
must be left blank. If more than one card is used, however, only column 
80 on the last card needs to be left blank; the first 79 characters of the 
title will be printed on each page of the output. 
e.g. TI Multidimensionality of Self-concept 
3. Data Specification 
The second major control card is the DA card, which defines the data to 
be analyzed. In order to provide these details, however, additional infor-
mation is provided by means of the following specifications: 
NGroups = Number of groups for which data are available. 
NInpvar = Number of input variables. 
Nabs 
= Number of observations (Le., sample size); if N is unknown 
and raw data are being input, set NO = 0; the program will 
compute N. 
MAtrix = Type of matrix to be analyzed. 
• KM for correlation matrix. 
• CM for covariance matrix. 
• MM for moment matrix. 
• AM for augmented moment matrix. 

18 
2. Using the LISREL Program 
It is important to note, however, that the matrix to be analyzed may 
differ from the one read into the computer as data input. For example, 
the data may be input in the form of a KM, but you may wish to have 
analyses based on the CM. LISREL can always compute the matrix to 
be analyzed, regardless of the type of data that are input. 
e.g. DA NG= 1 NI=4 NO =400 MA=KM 
~ 
Cols 1 2 4 5. . . . . . . . 
. .. 25 
In this example, the DA card indicates that there is only one group to 
be analyzed,l there are four input variables, the sample size is 400, and 
the data are going to be entered in the form of a correlation matrix. 
3.1. Further Specification of the Data 
The DA card is further defined by four additional pieces of information; 
each is entered on a separate line of input as follows: 
(i) LAbels 
t 
ColI 
One label, eight characters or less, must be provided for each input 
variable. The easiest way to provide this information is to enter the 
variable names in free format. As such, they are entered in the same 
order as the variables appear in the data set; each label is enclosed 
in single quotes and separated by blanks. This format is indicated in 
column 1 of the next card. 
(ii) Format in which variable labels are to be read. If the format is free, 
as noted earlier, an asterisk (*) is placed in column 1. 
(iii) The matrix form in which the data are being input. Two pieces of 
information are required: the type of matrix and the particular form 
of the matrix. Each piece of information is represented by a two-letter 
keyword; both are entered on the same line, separated by a blank. 
The choices are as follows: 
Matrix Type 
RA for raw data matrix. 
KM for correlation matrix. 
CM for covariance matrix. 
MM for moment matrix. 
Matrix Form 
FU for full matrix. 
SY for symmetric matrix. 
'The default value for NG is 1.0. This means that it is not necessary to enter 
NG = 1; LISREL will automatically base the analyses on one group. The input 
would then read: 
DA NI=4 NO =400 MA=KM. 

3. Data Specification 
19 
(iv) The information in the input format tells LISREL how each set of 
numbers represents the variables in the data set. The input format 
can be either fixed or free. In either case, LISREL reads all data row-
wise, from left to right. 
Fixed Format. This format indicates that the data are to be read accord-
ing to a specific formula, a Fortran statement. It specifies the number and 
location of columns occupied by each variable, in addition to the number 
of decimal points included for each variable score, if any. A Fortran state-
ment is always parenthesized; the initial parenthesis is placed in column 
1. 
Free Format. This format indicates that the data are to be read as one 
long string of numbers; no specific columns are linked to any variable. 
The only requirement here is that each variable score must be separated 
by a blank. When this type of format is used, an asterisk (*) is placed in 
Column 1. 
The above four lines are then followed by data entry. 
Continuing with our example based on Figure 1.2, let's look at the input 
of this additional information using a Fortran statement and a free format. 
e.g. (a) LA 
* 
'SDQGSC' 'SESGSC' 'SDQASC' 'SCAASC' 
KMSY 
(4F3.2) 
100 
70100 
5055100 
454880100 
This format indicates that there are four rows representing four vari-
ables in a symmetric matrix form. LISREL then reads each row from left 
to right, counting three digits and then placing a decimal point to the left 
of the last two digits. Blanks represent zeros and are therefore taken into 
consideration in counting the three digits. 
e.g. (b) LA 
* 
'SDQGSC' 'SESGSC' 'SDQASC' 'SCAASC' 
KMSY 
* 
1.00 
.70 1.00 
.50 .55 1.00 
.45 .48 .80 1.00 

20 
2. Using the LISREL Program 
Here we have the same matrix of numbers but read in free format fash-
ion. In this form, blanks are used to separate score values. 
• Hint 
Remember to account for column 1 when formulating the Fortran state-
ment. Otherwise, you will get an error message that will in no way alert 
you to the fact that this has not been done (e.g., the input matrix is not 
positive definite). When using the free format, be sure to enter the first 
1.00 in column 1. 
3.2. Optional Input 
Means and Standard Deviations. For certain problems, it may be neces-
sary to include the mean and standard deviation values for each variable. 
This information can be included by first adding an ME or SD card, fol-
lowed by a free format card (*), followed by the actual values for each 
variable. In other words, a minimum of three lines is required for the 
input of means and for the input of standard deviations. This information 
is entered, beginning with column 1. When both means and standard devi-
ations are added, the three lines related to means are added first, as 
shown later. This information follows immediately after entry of the data 
matrix. 
e.g. ME 
* 
76.41 52.9055.6049.22 
SD 
* 
W.W 9.054.567.80 
Selection of Variables. For a variety of reasons, the user may wish to 
use only certain variables from those listed on the LA card. This is easily 
done by adding a SElect card after the row of SDs and listing the variables 
(either by name or number) in the order in which they are to be read; this 
is followed by a slash (/); the slash indicates that certain variables are 
being eliminated from the analyses. 
Suppose that in our previous example we did not wish to include the 
variable 'SESGSC' in the analyses. We then eliminate it by entering a 
select card as: 
SE 1 34/ 
The SE card is also used to change the order in which the variables are 
read into the analyses. In the previous example, the order of the variables 
is being read automatically in the order, 1234. Therefore, an SE card is 
not required. But if the cards are to read in a different order than the way 
they have been input, an SE card is required. For example, 
SE 1 324 

4. Model Specification 
21 
This indicates that the variable 'SDQASC' is to be read after 'SDQ-
GSC' instead of after 'SESGSC.' 
• Hint 
1. If all variables are being used, the SE card is not required. 
2. If the SE card has been used to indicate missing variables, and the 
slash has not been included, LISREL will print an error message. How-
ever, the error message may not relate in any way to the fact that the 
slash has been omitted. The fact that the problem did not run should 
alert you to the fact that something is not right. 
4. Model Specification 
The third major control card is the MO card, which specifies the model 
to be analyzed. Model specification involves four pieces of information: 
I.The number of observed variables in the model (Xs or Ys). 
2.The number oflatent variables in the model (~s or 'lis). LISREL reports 
~s as KSls, and the 'lis as ETAs. 
3.The form of each matrix to be analyzed. 
4.The estimation status of each matrix. 
We turn now to each of these components. 
4.1. Observed Variables 
Since we are only interested in CF A models as presented in Chapter 1, 
model specifications will include either X variables or Y variables-but 
not both. The keywords are as follows: 
NX = number of X variables in the model. 
NY = number of Y variables in the model. 
4.2. Latent Variables 
As noted in Chapter 1, a CF A model specification will include either ~s 
(KSls) or 'lis (ET As)-not both. The keywords are as follows: 
N K = number of ~s in the model. 
NE = number of l1S in the model. 
4.3. Basic Matrix Forms 
To understand the CF A applications presented in this book, five basic 
matrix forms need to be known; these are presented in Figure 2.1.

FIGURE 2.1. Basic Matrix Forms in LISREL. 
Several points need to be noted here with respect to the treatment of 
these matrices in the LISREL program. These are as follows: 
1. The XS in the FU, SY, and DI matrices represent values that are stored 
in the computer. This means that: 
(a) If a matrix is specified as SY, one cannot refer to elements in the 
upper triangle of the matrix. As far as LISREL is concerned, these 
elements do not exist. 
(b) If a matrix is specified as DI, one cannot refer to off-diagonal ele-
ments. Again, these elements are not stored in the computer. 
2. If a matrix is stored as an ID or ZE matrix, one cannot refer to any 
element in these matrices. This is because neither matrix is stored in 
the computer. 
4.4. Matrix Estimation Status 
As shown in Figure 1.3, if the model to be analyzed is an all-X CFA 
model, then only the lambda-X (LX), phi (PH), and theta-delta (TD) ma-

4. Model Specification 
23 
trices are of interest. Alternatively, if an all-Y model is specified, then 
the lambda-Y (LY), psi (PS), and theta-epsilon (TE) matrices are of inter-
est. In either case, the status of each of the three matrices must be speci-
fied. This means that LISREL parameters representing these matrices 
must be specified according to whether or not they are to be estimated, 
and if they are, then how they are to be estimated. That is, they are speci-
fied as being FRee, FIxed, or EQual to other parameters in the model. 
FRee parameters indicate that these values are unknown and therefore 
will be estimated by the program. 
FIxed parameters are assigned some particular value by the investiga-
tor; they are therefore not estimated by the program. 
EQual parameters indicate that they have been constrained to have the 
same estimated value as certain other parameters in the model. LISREL 
estimates the initial parameter; all other parameters that are constrained 
equal to it will thus have the same estimated value. 
Specification of the status of a matrix means that all elements in that 
matrix have the same status. 
e.g. LX = FU ,FI specifies that Lambda-X is a full matrix with all ele-
ments fixed to some value, to be input later in the setup. The 
default value for fixed parameters is 0.0. This means that if no 
value is specified by the investigator, the value will be automati-
cally fixed at 0.0 by the program. 
e.g. TD = DI,FR specifies that Theta Delta is a diagonal matrix with 
all elements free to be estimated by the program. 
Before proceeding, we need to make a slight digression in order to say 
a few words about Default Values. All computer programs operate with 
certain default values. What this means is that when a particular specifi-
cation is omitted from an input setup, the program automatically imple-
ments a fixed value that has been preselected on the basis of most com-
mon use. With LISREL, default values are associated with particular 
matrix specifications. 
The advantage of default values is that they can often reduce, substan-
tially, the amount of time required to input the specification information. 
In order not to confuse you at this point, however, example inputs will 
specify all parameters and will not rely on the default values. 
Default values for the specification of parameter matrices for CF A 
models are presented in Table 2.1. Thus, it can be seen that if LX only 
appeared on the MO card, the program would, by default, treat it as a full 
matrix with elements fixed to 0.0 (unless otherwise specified later in the 
input).

4.5. Additional Model Specification 
In Section 4.4., we learned how to specify the status of an entire matrix. 
However, in most cases, the model will require further refinement. This 
is accomplished by specifying certain matrix elements as fixed, free, or 
constrained equal to other parameters. As such, three additional control 
cards come into play. We turn now to these input details. 
The Estimation Status of Matrix Elements. Regardless of the status of a 
matrix, any of its elements can be specified to have a different status. 
That is to say, although the matrix may be specified as fixed (free), any 
of its elements may be individually specified as free (fixed). Matrix ele-
ments are identified by parenthesizing their coordinate points (i. e., their 
intersecting row and column numbers as shown in Chapter 1), which are 
separated by commas. 
e.g. MO NX=4 NK=2 LX=FU,FI PH=SY,FR TD=DI,FR 
FR LX(2,l) LX(4,2) 
FI TD(l,l) 
This example specifies that the model has four X (observed) variables 
and two ~ (latent) variables. LX is a full matrix with its elements fixed 
to some value; two elements, however, are to be freely estimated. This 
specification is depicted in Figure 2.2

FIGURE 2.2. The Specified LX Matrix. 
The assigned values in Figure 2.2(c) need some elaboration. Since we 
are working with a CF A model, we are postulating that certain observed 
variables will load on particular latent variables. In this case, we are hy-
pothesizing that All and A2\ load on Factor 1 (~I)' and that A32 and A4210ad 
on Factor 2 (~2)' Thus, A31, A41 , A12, and A22 are fixed to zero. For purposes 
of statistical identification2 and in order to establish the scale of metric, 
one of the free parameters being estimated for each factor should be fixed 
to 1.00. Although most investigators fix the first of a set of AS to 1.00, this 
decision is an arbitrary one. 
Similarly, TD is specified as a diagonal matrix with all elements except 
TD(1,I) free to be estimated. As shown in Figure 2.3, only the diagonal 
elements are of interest, therefore the off-diagonal parameters have been 
fixed to zero; 811 has been fixed to .20.

Alternatively, the preceding example could be specified as follows: 
e.g. MO NX=4 NK=2 LX=FU,FR PH=SY,FR 
TD=DI,FI 
FI LX(l,l) LX(3,l) LX(4,1) LX(l,2) LX(2,2) LX(3,2) 
FR TD(2,2) TD(3,3) TD(4,4? 
A review of Figures 2.2 and 2.3 will quickly demonstrate that the two 
model specifications are identical. 
• Hint 
It is now easy to see that there is more than one way to specify a model. 
For the sake of expedience, it is best to specify the matrix in accordance 
with the desired status of most of its elements. In other words, if most 
of the elements are to be estimated, specify the status of the matrix as 
'free.' On the other hand, if most elements are fixed parameters (see, 
e.g., Figures 2.2 and 2.3), specify the matrix as 'fixed.' In this way, less 
input is required in specifying the status of individual matrix elements. 
3Where a consecutive range of values is to be estimated, the first and last elements 
can be hyphenated, e.g., TD(2,2)-TD(4,4). 

4. Model Specification 
27 
Assigning Values for Fixed Parameters. In the case where a fixed param-
eter is to have a nonzero value rather than the default value of 0.0, the 
VAlue and/or STart control cards are used. The V A and ST cards are 
equivalent, and may be used synonymously. The keyword on either card 
is followed by a number, which is taken as the assigned value for the 
accompanying list of matrix elements. 
e.g. FI LX(l,l) LX(3,2) 
VA 1.0 LX(l,l) LX(3,2) 
or 
ST 1.0 LX(1,l) LX(3,2) 
This example indicates that elements (l,1) and (3,2) in the LX matrix 
are to be fixed to a value of 1.0. 
• Hint 
For convenience, it is often advisable to use the V A cards to indicate 
assigned values for fixed parameters, and ST cards to indicate starting 
values for free parameters. 
Beginning with the LISREL V version, the program can generate its 
own start values. However, the user has the option to enter values if he 
or she wishes. In this case, the ST control card is used to specify starting 
values for the estimation of free rather than fixed parameters. 
However, readers are urged not to rely too heavily on the program-
generated start values. This feature appears to work well with simple 
models that have estimated values close to the initial LISREL estimates. 
However, as soon as model specifications become more complex or when 
estimates are not close to the initial LISREL estimates, the program often 
abends (i.e., terminates prematurely). 
It is recommended, therefore, that the user always enters his or her 
own start values. These values may be derived from a preliminary run 
in which only the initial estimates are requested. However, a quick and 
reasonable rule of thumb for a set of CFA start values is as follows: ~s 
= 7.00; </>s or "'S (variances) = .50; </>s or "'S (covariances) = .20; 8s or 
lOS (variances) = .10. 
• Hints 
In selecting start values: 
I. Be sure to make diagonal values larger than off-diagonal values or 
you will get an error message that "the information matrix is not pos-
itive definite." 
2. If the program abends, consider the possibility of negative start val-
ues for some of the AS and <\>s (covariances). 

28 
2. Using the LISREL Program 
5. Output Specification 
Decisions regarding output fall into two categories: method of parameter 
estimation and information related to analyses. This information is speci-
fied on the OU card. 
5.1. Method of Parameter Estimation 
The estimation of parameters may be obtained by five different methods; 
these options involve the use of: instrumental variables (IV), two-stage 
least squares (TSLS), unweighted least squares (ULS), generalized least 
squares (GLS), and maximum likelihood (ML). Since the underlying as-
sumptions differ for each of these methods, the user is strongly advised 
to select the one most appropriate for his or her data. The IV and TSLS 
methods are fast and are not based on an iterative process; they can be 
used conveniently with large samples. The ULS, GLS, and ML methods, 
on the other hand, compute estimates iteratively, using the IV and TSLS 
estimates as start values; these constitute the LISREL automatic start 
values. 
The user selects anyone of the five estimation procedures and enters 
the keyword on the OU card. In the selection of ULS, GLS, and ML, 
LISREL prints the initial and the final estimates. The keywords and the 
resulting output are as follows: 
IV 
only the IV estimates are computed. 
TS = only the TSLS estimates are computed. 
UL = both the IV and ULS estimates are computed. 
GL = both the TSLS and GLS estimates are computed. 
ML = both the TSLS and ML estimates are computed. 
Default = ML 
This means that if no estimation method is entered on the au card, 
parameters will automatically be estimated using ML. Initial esti-
mates based on IV are also provided . 
• Hint 
If the user wants to enter his or her own start values but has no idea 
of values, it can be helpful to obtain these from the program by request-
ing only the initial estimates. This can be done by entering the keyword 
IV on the au card; this is equivalent to TS. If more than one of these 
keywords is entered on the au card, LISREL will only recognize the 
last one. 
5.2. Information Related to Analyses 
Although LISREL provides a standard output (see Figure 2.4), the user 
can select from a number of options regarding additional information to 

I. Standard Output 
29 
be printed on the output. The appropriate keyword is simply added to the 
OU card. The options available, together with the accompanying key-
words, are as follows: 
PT = Print technical output. 
SE = Print standard errors. 
TV = Print t-values. 
PC = Print <,(orreiations of ~stimates. 
RS = Print I, residuals S-I, normalized residuals, Q-plot. 
EF = Print total effects. 
VA = Print variances and covariances. 
MR = Equivalent to RS, EF, and VA. 
MI = Print modification indices. 
FS = Print factor scores regression. 
FD = Print first derivatives. 
SS = Print standatdized solution. 
AL = Print all output. 
NS = No automatic start values. 
TO = Print with 80 characters per record; default: 132 characters. 
ND = Number of decimal places to be printed (0-8); default: ND=3. 
TM = Maximum number of CPU-seconds allowed for problem; default: 
TM=60. 
The meaning and interpretation of the optional output are discussed as 
they relate to specific applications as presented in subsequent chapters. 
• Hint 
I. Be sure to add NS to the OU card when entering your own start 
values or you will get a strange error message that is in no way related 
to the problem. 
2. The LISREL program is expensive in that it uses a lot of CPU time. 
To cut costs, only request output that is directly of use to you at anyone 
step in your analysis. For example, it only makes sense to request the 
standardized solution after you have achieved the final best-fitting 
model. 
LISREL Output 
1. Standard Output 
LISREL provides a standard output that is printed whether or not other 
selected options have been entered. It includes the following information: 
log of read control cards, the title, the parameter listing, the parameter 
specifications, the matrix to be analyzed, the initial estimates, the LIS-
REL estimates (ML or ULS), and the overall goodness-of-fit measures. 
Figure 2.4 lists the standard output based on our hypothetical two-factor 
model presented in Figure 1.3.

2. Using the LISREL Program 
2. Error Messages 
Errors are inevitable, regardless of how familiar someone is with a com-
puter package. Usually, an error message provides some clue as to the 
location of the error and how it might be corrected. Unfortunately, this 
is not always the case with LISREL; as such, the link between the mes-
sage and the problem is often remote. In most cases, these seemingly 
bizarre messages are related to simple syntax errors; that is, errors that 
result from such things as omitting a symbol (e.g., slash on the SE card), 
omitting a space or comma (e.g., LX = FUFI), or misspelling a keyword. 
Thus, the first thing to do when confronted with an error message is to 
reexamine your input cards, looking very carefully for syntax errors. 
Some common mistakes you might make are: 
• Using keywords that don't conform to the LISREL naming conven-
tions. 
• Omitting required slashes, equal signs, commas, or spaces. 
• Leaving pairs of parentheses or apostrophes unmatched. 
• Placing the TI, DA, MO, or OU cards in the wrong order. 
• Inputting a data correlation matrix and forgetting to account for column 
1. 
• Using lower-case, rather than upper-case lettering. 
• Using start values that are too far away from the actual parameter val-
ues. This can happen, for example, if the start value is entered as a 
positive number but the actual value is negative. 
• Forgetting to put NS on the OU card when you have input your own 
start values. 
Summary 
This chapter outlined basic information related to using the LISREL com-
puter program for the analysis of CFA models. The focus of the chapter, 
for the most part, concentrated on particulars related to program input. 
As such, details of program setup were examined separately for each of 
the four major input components: problem run specification, data specifi-
cation, model specification, and output specification. Along the way, 
hints were provided in an attempt to help the user make the most efficient 
use of his or her time. An example of the standard LISREL output was 
provided based on the hypothetical model presented in Figure 1.3. Fi-
nally, suggestions for interpreting and preventing error messages were 
provided. 

Section II Single-Group Analyses 

3 
Application 1: Validating a Theoretical 
Construct 
Our first application, in broad terms, tests the hypothesis that adolescent 
self-concept (SC) is a multidimensional construct consisting of four fac-
tors: general SC(GSC) , academic SC (ASC) , English SC (ESC), and 
mathematics SC (MSC). The theoretical basis for this hypothesis derives 
from the hierarchical model of SC proposed by Shavelson, Hubner, and 
Stanton (1976). (For details of the study related to this application, see 
Byrne & Shavelson, 1986.) 
Although a number of studies have supported the multidimensionality 
of SC, there have been counterarguments that SC is a unidimensional 
structure. Thus to test the multidimensionality of SC against the counter-
hypothesis, the primary hypothesis is tested against two alternative 
hypotheses: that SC is a two-factor structure consisting of an academic 
component (ASC) and a general component (GSC) and that SC is a unidi-
mensional construct. 
We now examine each of these hypotheses separately, and in more 
detail. 
Hypothesis 1: Self-Concept Is a Four-Factor Structure 
The model to be tested in Hypothesis 1 postulates a priori that SC is a 
four-factor structure consisting of GSC, ASC, ESC, and MSC. It is pre-
sented schematically in Figure 3.1 
To work with LISREL, we must now translate what we see in the 
model into a set of computer statements that define the CF A model to be 
tested. Let's begin by dissecting the model presented in Figure 3.1 and 
listing what we observe. 
1. There are four SC factors (~I-~). 
2. The four factors are intercorrelated (<I>s). 
3. There are 12 observed measures (Xs). 
4. These observed measures load onto the factors in the following pat-
tern: X I-X3 load onto Factor 1; XCX6 load onto Factor 2; X,X9 load 
onto Factor 3; and XIO-Xl2load onto Factor 4. 

38 
3. Application I: Validating a Theoretical Construct 
FIGURE 3.1. Hypothesized Structure of Four-Factor Model of Self-Concept. 
5. Each X variable loads on one and only one factor. 
6. Measurement error is taken into account for each X variable (8s). 
7. the errors of measurement are uncorrelated. 
Summarizing these observations, we can now present a more formal 
description of our hypothesized model. As such, we can say that the CF A 
model presented here hypothesizes a priori that: 

Hypothesis I: Self Concept Is a Four-Factor Structure 
39 
(a) SC responses can be explained by four factors: GSC, ASC, ESC, and 
MSC. 
(b) Each subscale measure has a nonzero loading on the SC factor that it 
was designed to measure (termed a "target loading") and a zero load-
ing on all other factors (termed "nontarget loadings"). 
(c) The four SC factors, consistent with the theory, are correlated. 
(d) Error/uniqueness l terms for each of the measures are uncorrelated. 
Table 3.1 summarizes the pattern of parameters to be estimated for the 
factor loading (lambda X; Ax), factor variance-covariance (phi; <1» and 
error variance-covariance (theta delta; 8 8) matrices. The /..s, <\>s, and 8s 
represent the parameters to be estimated; the Os and Is, the fixed parame-

IThe term uniqueness is used in the factor analytic sense to mean a composite 
of random measurement error and specific measurement error associated with 
a particular measuring instrument; in cross-sectional studies, the two cannot be 
separated (Gerbing & Anderson, 1984).

ters. For purposes of identification, the first of each congeneric see of 
SC measures was fixed to 1.0. 
2 A set of measures is congeneric if they all purport to assess the same construct, 
except for errors of measurement (Joreskog, 197Ib).

1. LISREL Input 
Now we are ready to translate this information into LISREL language, 
which is needed in setting up the input statements describing our postu-
lated model. The basic LISREL input for this model (Model 1), including 
the data, is presented in Table 3.2. The data are in the form of a correla-
tion matrix. 3 
Although the transition from Table 3.1 to Table 3.2 is fairly straightfor-
ward, a few words of explanation are in order. 
1. NI = 15-There are 15 instead of 12 input variables because in the 
original study, the analyses included three achievement measures, la-
beled as 'GPA,' 'ENG,' and 'MATH.' 
2. The SE card was used as a consequence of three changes required 
in reading the data correlation matrix. These are: 
(a) We do not want to include the variables GPA, ENG, and MATH (13, 
14, and 15, respectively).

3Correlations were computed using the SPSS program based on pairwise deletion 
of missing data. Subsequent to these analyses, however, I have since found good 
reason to base my analyses on correlation matrices derived from listwise deletion 
of missing data. I strongly recommend the latter, since it can often eliminate LIS-
REL convergence problems.

3. Application 1: Validating a Theoretical Construct 
(b) The correlation matrix was computed using an ordering of the vari-
ables that differed from their order of input (i.e., SDQGSC, APIGSC, 
SESGSC, SDQASC, APIASC, SCAASC, SDQESC, APIESC, 
SCAESC, SDQMSC, APIMSC, SCAMSC). 
(c) A preliminary exploratory factor analysis of the API revealed the Stu-
dent Self subscale (measuring ASC) to be problematic; only lO of the 
25 items loaded >0.25 on the ASC factor. Subsequently, this sub scale 
was deleted from the analyses as one measure of ASC. Elimination of 
the APIASC led to two important alterations to the pattern of esti-

mated parameters as shown in Table 3.2: (i) the subscripted number-
ing of the A parameters representing ASC, ESC, and MSC changed, 
resulting in the revised pattern of loadings as shown in Table 3.3, and 
(ii) the number of As and E>as was reduced from 12 to 11. 
3. The default values have been used for the MO card. Thus, although 
the keywords have not been listed, the LX, PH, and TD matrices are 
specifed as being fixed, free, and free, respectively. 
2. LISREL Output 
For purposes of discussion, the entire output is presented here for Appli-
cation 1 only; subsequently, selected segments of printout material will 
be presented. The discussion will focus on two major aspects of the print-
out: the LISREL summary of the specified model to be estimated and the 
assessment of model fit. The printed output for Model 1 is presented in 
Table 3.4.

2.1. Specified LISREL Model 
There are several advantages in having this information printed in the 
output. First, it enables the user to check for syntax errors in the input of 
the control cards and model specifications; this can be helpful in solving 
problems associated with a problematic computer run. Second, it pro-
vides a double check on the starting values of both the fixed and free 
parameters in the model. Finally, the numbering of estimated parameters 
acts as a countercheck that the fixed and free parameters are correct. This 
information also enables the user to confirm that the number of degrees of 
freedom provided by the program is accurate. 
The number of degrees of freedom is equ,!l to the difference between 
the number of parameters being estimated (~; the restricted correlation 
matrix) and the total number of parameters in the model (S; the sample 
correlation matrix). The total number of parameters in the model equals 
p (P + 1)/2 where p = observed variable. 
With respect to the present model, there are II observed variables; 
thus there are 66 ([11 x 12]/2) parameters in the entire model. Turning to 
page 46 of the printout, we can see that there are 28 parameters to be

3. Application I: Validating a Theoretical Construct 
estimat~d. This means that in fitting the restricted (i.e., hypothesized) 
model (I) to the sample data (S), we should have 38 degrees of freedom. 
2.2. Assessment of Model Fit 
The most important issue associated with the analysis of LISREL models 
is the assessment of fit between the hypothesized model and the sample 
data. If the goodness-of-fit is inadequate, the next logical step is to detect 
the source of misfit in the model. 
Many factors are taken into account in assessing the adequacy of a 
hypothesized model. Let's now examine the major aspects of this issue. 
2.2.1. Feasibility oj Parameter Estimates. The first step in examining 
model fit is to determine whether the parameter estimates are reasonable. 
If some parameters fall outside the admissable range, this is a clear indica-
tion that either the model is wrong or the input matrix lacks sufficient 
information. Examples of parameter estimates that are considered to be 
unreasonable are: negative variances, correlations> 1.00, and covariance 
or correlation matrices that are not positive definite. Given any of these 
conditions, LISREL prints a warning message. Other indicators of a bad 
model are standard errors that are excessively large and parameter esti-
mates that are highly correlated. 
An examination of the printout in Table 3.3 reveals all LISREL esti-
mates to be reasonable. The standard errors range from 0.010 to 0.047, 
which is highly acceptable. 
2.2.2. Adequacy oJthe Measurement Model. The second step in assess-
ing model fit is to examine the squared multiple correlation (R2) for each 
observed variable and the coefficient of determination for all the observed 
variables jointly. These values should range from zero to 1.00; values 
close to 1.00 represent good models. Negative values are a clear indica-
tion that something is wrong with the postulated model. 
The R2 is an indication of the reliability of each observed measure with 
respect to its underlying latent construct. In examining the observed mea-
sures of GSC, we see that SESGSC was the most reliable (R2 = 0.81), 
while the APIGSC was the least reliable (R2 = 0.51). 
The coefficient of determination is an indication of how well the ob-
served variables, in combination, serve as measuring instruments for all 
the latent variables jointly; it is a generalized indicator of reliability for 
the entire measurement model. Looking at the output, we see that the 
coefficient of determination is remarkably high (0.999), indicating that the 
measurement model is excellent. 
2.2.3. Goodness-oj-Fit oj the Overall Model. LISREL provides four in-
dices of fit for the model as a whole: X2 with its associated degrees of 
freedom and probability level (ML and GLS only), the goodness-of-fit 
index (GFI), the adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), and the root-

mean-square residual (RMR). (For a review and assessment of these indi-
ces, see Marsh, Balla, & McDonald, 1988). 
When the sample size is sufficiently large, X2 is a likelihood ratio test 
statistic that can be used to test the fit between the restricted hypothe-
sized model and the unrestricted sample data. According to this index, as 
shown in Table 3.3, the overall fit for the initial model is poor (l (38) = 
627.57). 
The OFI indicates the relative amount of variance and covariance 
jointly explained by the model; the AOFI differs from the OFI only in the 
fact that it adjusts for the number of degrees of freedom in the model. 
Both indices range from zero to 1.00, with a value close to 1.00 indicating 
a good fit. Although Joreskog and Sorbom (1985) argue that the OFI (and 
AOFI), unlike l, are independent of sample size and robust to departures 
from multinormality, others have disputed this claim (see, e.g., Marsh, 
Balla, & McDonald, 1988). 
The OFI in our present application is found to be 0.892, thus represent-
ing a fairly good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed 
data. However, when the degrees of freedom are taken into account, the 
goodness of fit diminishes somewhat (AOFI = 0.813). 
The RMR indicates the average discrepancy between the elements in 
the sample and hypothesized covariance matrices; values range from zero 
to 1.00. Oiven a good fit beteen the two models, the RMR will be small; 
this value should be <0.05. The reader is cautioned, however, that wrong 
models can also have RMRs <0.05. Thus, it is important not to rely too 
heavily on this single piece of information in determining model fit. 
2.2.4. Subjective Goodness-oj-Fit Indices Jor Overall Model. The sensi-
tivity of the llikelihood ratio test to sample size, as well as to the viola-
tion of various model assumptions (linearity, multinormality, additivity) 
is now widely known. As an alternative to l, other goodness-of-fit indi-
ces have been proprosed (for a review, see Marsh, Balla, & McDonald, 
1988). Two of the more commonly used subjective indices are the l/df 
ratio and the Bentler and Bonett (1980) normed index (BBI). 
A variety of acceptable values for the l/df ratio have been proposed, 
ranging from a low of < 1.50 for a sample size of 1000 (Muthen, personal 
communication, January 1987), through <3.00 (Carmines & McIver, 
1981), to <5.00 (Wheaton, Muthen, Alwin, & Summers, 1977). At this 
point in our knowledge of LISREL models and the l test statistic, it 
seems clear that a l/df ratio >2.00 represents an inadequate fit. 
The l/df ratio for the hypothesized model in our current application is 
shown to be 627.57/38 = 16.52. This value clearly represents an unac-
ceptable fit to the observed data. 
The BEl ranges from zero to 1.00 and is derived from the comparison 
of some specified (i.e., restricted) model, with a null model (i.e., one that 
posits complete independence of all observed measurements). Thus, it

provides a measure of complete covariation in the data; a value >0.90 
indicates a psychometrically acceptable fit to the observed data. 
Related to the present application, the BBI is determined by comparing 
the fit of our four-factor hypothesized model with that of an II-factor null 
model. The null model, then, simply represents one in which each ob-
served variable is hypothesized as measuring one independent factor. The 
LISREL specification input for the null model is presented in Table 3.5. 
The computation of the BBI is (Po -
Fj)/Fo where Fo = the l value 
of the null model and F j = the X2 of the restricted model. The X2 likeli-
hood ratio for the null model in Application I was 7523.68 (55). Thus, the 
BBI was computed to be: (7523.68 -
627.57)/7523.68 = 0.917, which, 
although it falls within the acceptable range for goodness-of-fit, is only 
marginally so, thus indicating some degree of misfit in the model. 
It is important to emphasize that the l, GFI, AGFI, RMR, l/df, and 
BBI are measures of overall fit; they do not pinpoint areas of misfit in a 
particular model. To determine this information, it is necessary to exam-
ine indices that relate to specific parameters in the model. We turn now 
to this portion of the output. 
2.2.5. Goodness-oj-Fit oj Individual Model Parameters. LISREL pro-
vides several indices that can assist the researcher in isolating parameters 
that may be contributing to the overall misfit of a hypothesized model. 
However, these indices provide a statistical approach to the problem only 
and must be considered in conjunction with the substantive meaningful-
ness of the model. While the program provides many different indices, 
only those pertinent to the present application will be described here. 
(a) T-Values. One of the initial things to look at when searching for 
misfit in a model is to examine the statistical significance of each parame-
ter. Nonsignificant parameters can be considered unimportant to the 
model and can be subsequently fixed to a value of 0.0; they are thereby 
deleted from the model. The statistical significance of parameters can be 
determined by examining the t-values provided by LISREL. These values 
represent the parameter estimate divided by its standard error. As such, 
t-values provide evidence of whether or not a parameter is significantly 
different from zero; values >2.00 are generally considered to be statisti-
cally significant. 
An examination of the current output shows t-values ranging from 
2.305 to 49.610. All parameters may therefore be considered statistically 
significant and thus important to the hypothesized model. 

2. LlSREL Output 
57 
(b) Normalized Residuals. 4 LISREL provides information on the resid-
ual of fit for each parameter, that is, the discrepancy of fit between the 
sample and hypothesized covariance matrices. These residual covari-
ances are reported in both their real metric and standardized form. The 
latter are referred to in the program as normalized residuals; they are the 
easier of the two to interpret since they can be considered analogous to 
Z-scores. Normalized residuals represent estimates of the number of 
standard deviations the observed residuals are from the zero residuals 
that would exist if the model were a perfectly fitting one. Values >2.00 
for any element provide a clue as to possible model misspecification; in 
our output, we see 11 such values. 
To assist the researcher in further evaluating model fit, LISREL pro-
vides a Q-plot, which graphs the normalized residuals. Residuals that fol-
low the dotted line rising at a 45-degree angle in the Q-plot are indicative 
of a well-fitting model. Those that deviate widely from the 45-degree line 
in a nonlinear fashion indicate that the model is in some way misspecified. 
Boomsma (1982) has noted that such departures from normality tend to 
be larger for uniquenesses than for other model parameters. Examination 
of the Q-plot for our SC data shows a clear deviation from the upper 
portion of the dotted line. Thus, we have further evidence to suggest that 
certain parameters in the model are misspecified. 
(c) Modification Indices. For each fixed parameter in a specified 
model, LISREL provides a modification index (MI). This value repre-
sents the expected drop in l if a particular parameter were freely esti-
mated. As such, in a respecification and reestimation of the model, the 
decrease in l should be at least equal to the MI; it may, however, be 
much larger. MIs can therefore be examined in relation to l with one 
degree of freedom. All free parameters automatically have MI values 
equal to zero. 
LISREL automatically prints out the fixed parameter having the largest 
MI. If the researcher is unhappy with the overall fit of the hypothesized 
model, he or she can respecify a model in which this parameter is set 
free; the model is then reestimated. It must be emphasized, however, that 
the decision of whether or not to free this parameter must make substan-
tive sense; if it does not, then consideration can be given to freeing the 
fixed parameter having the next highest MI. It is important, however, to 
relax only one parameter at a time. 
Although the LISREL VI program provides an option for automatic 
model respecification based on the MIs, this is never a wise option and 
is definitely not recommended. Only the researcher is capable of judging 
the balance between statistical and substantive model fit. Thus, model 
respecification must remain the decision of the researcher and not of the 
LISREL program. 
4In the most recent version of LlSREL (LlSREL VII) the term "standardized 
residuals" is used. 

58 
3. Application I: Validating a Theoretical Construct 
The process of respecification and reestimation based on the examina-
tion of MIs can be repeated until an acceptable model fit is attained. How-
ever, the analyses then fall into the category of post hoc analyses and, 
thus, the researcher must realize that the analyses are then exploratory, 
rather than confirmatory in character; confirmatory factor analyses 
ceased once the hypothesized model was rejected due to a poor fit with 
the observed data. The issue of post hoc model fitting is addressed later 
in the chapter. 
Reviewing the output in Table 3.4, we see that the largest MI is 199.76 
for TD(8,5).5 This parameter represents a covariance between the ESC 
and ASC subscales of the SCA. Such correlated errors can be substan-
tively meaningful in reflecting minor, possibly sample-specific data co-
variation not explained by the model (Gerbing & Anderson, 1984; Tanaka 
& Huba, 1984). Frequently, this covariation results from nonrandom er-
ror introduced by a particular measurement method; one example is that 
of method effects due to the item format associated with subscales of a 
particular measuring instrument. 
Confronted with these results, then, it was considered prudent to take 
an exploratory approach in establishing a well-fitting model. For purposes 
of demonstrating these post hoc analyses, we will now continue to fit our 
four-factor model until we are satisfied that we have reached one that is 
statistically best fitting, yet substantively meaningful; thus a series of 
nested alternative models were specified and estimated. 
To begin, let us again look at the MIs in Table 3.4. We see that the 
largest MI for Model 1 represents an error covariance between the En-
glish and academic SC subscales of the SCA; we therefore specify a 
model in which TD(8,5) is set free; we'll call this Model 2. Since the pa-
rameter TD(8,5) represents an off-diagonal value, this means that we can 
no longer specify the TD matrix to be diagonal. Theta delta must now be 
specified as a symmetric matrix that is fixed (SY,FI). This means, also, 
that we must specify all diagonal values (variances) to be free as well 
(TD 1,1-TD 11,11). These specification changes are illustrated in Table 
3.6. 
The estimation of Model 2 yielded a l (37) value of 427.01. The differ-
ence in fit between Models 1 and 2, expressed as 6.l, is 200.56. Since 
6.l is distributed as l with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in 
degrees of freedom between the two models, the significance of this value 
5Strangely, given the same model specifications as shown in Table 3.2, the MIs 
are accorded different values when the LISREL VI program is used. This is be-
cause only the diagonal elements in the TD matrix are considered (the off-diago-
nals are not taken into consideration). However, if the error-covariance matrix is 
specified as TD=SY,FI, with all the diagonal elements (TDl,I-TDll,ll) speci-
fied as free parameters (which represents an equivalent specification), the MIs 
are identical to those estimated by the LISREL V version when the TD matrix is 
specified as a diagonal matrix (TD = DI).

can be tested statistically; of course, !i..l (1) = 200.56 is highly significant 
and indicates a substantial improvement in model fit. Nonetheless, given 
a l (37) = 427.01, we must conclude that there still remains a high degree 
of misfit in the model.

In like fashion, building each time on the assessment of individual esti-
mated parameter fit for each previously specified model, a series of mod-
els was subsequently specified and estimated until one was obtained that 
both exhibited an acceptable statistical fit and indicated a substantively 
meaningful representation ofthe observed data. In total, 11 post hoc mod-
els were eventually hypothesized before an acceptable fit was obtained. 
Steps in the model-fitting process in reaching this final model are summa-
rized in Table 3.7. 
The l overall fit of this final model was 59.19 with 27 degrees of free-
dom (lldf = 2.19; BBI = .991); the input for this final model is shown

3. Application I: Validating a Theoretical Construct 
3. The Issue of Post Hoc Model Fitting 
The pros and cons of post hoc model fitting are well debated in the litera-
ture. While some have severely criticized the practice (e.g., Cliff, 1983; 
Cudeck & Browne, 1983), others have argued that as long as the re-
searcher is fully cognizant of the exploratory nature of his or her analy-
ses, the process can be substantively meaningful (e.g., Byrne, Shavelson, 
& Muthen, 1989; Tanaka & Huba, 1984); practical, as well as statistical 
significance can be taken into account. 
Undoubtedly, post hoc model fitting with confirmatory covariance 
structure models is problematic. With multiple model specifications, 
there is the risk of capitalizing on chance factors, and thus, the increased 
probability of making Type lor Type II errors. Furthermore, at this point 
in time, there is no direct way to adjust for the probability of such error. 
This represents a serious limitation in the analysis of covariance struc-
tures since, realistically, most psychological research is likely to require 
the specification of alternative models in order to attain one that fits well 
(see, e.g., Anderson & Gerbing, 1988; MacCallum, 1986). One approach 
to the problem, however, is to employ a cross-validation strategy; none-
theless, this process too requires judicial implementation (for a review of 
advantages and disadvantages, see Byrne et al., 1989). 
Until such time that statisticians resolve the problem of experiment-
wise error associated with post hoc model fitting, researchers are encour-
aged to gather maximal information regarding individual model parame-
ters albeit bearing in mind that, as with other statistical procedures, such 
information comes at a price-the risk of capitalization on chance factors. 
(Technical details regarding tests for the sensitivity of post hoc model 
parameters is provided in Chapter 4.) Indeed, I cannot emphasize too 
strongly, the importance of exercising sound judgement in the implemen-
tation of these procedures; constrained parameters should not be relaxed 
unless it makes sense substantively to do so. Only a solid theoretical and 
substantive knowledge of one's subject area can guide this investigative 
process. Cross-validation procedures can then be used to test for the va-
lidity of these results. 
Hypothesis 2: Self-Concept Is a Two-Factor Structure 
The model to be tested in this hypothesis postulates a priori that SC is a 
two-factor structure consisting of GSC and ASC. As such, all three GSC 
measures load onto the GSC factor, while all other measures load onto 
the ASC factor. This model argues against the viability of subject-specific 
SC academic factors. This model is schematically represented in Figure 
3.3.

FIGURE 3.3. Hypothesized Structure of Two-Factor Model of Self-Concept. 
As with our four-factor model, we will again examine the pattern of 
specified factor loadings, variance-covariances, and error variances. For 
purposes of comparison, relevant cross-loadings and all error covariances 
specified in the four-factor model were similarly specified in the two-fac-
tor model. This specification is presented in Table 3.10 and the accompa-
nying LISREL input is shown in Table 3.11.

·Secondary factor loadings and error covariances consistent with final four-factor model. 
An examination of the overall fit of this model indicates that it is clearly 
not a good fit to the data. Selected portions of the LISREL output show-

Hypothesis 3: Self-Concept Is a One-Factor Structure 
A review of the SC literature reveals that there are many who still argue 
for the unidimensionality ofthe construct. Thus, it was considered impor-
tant to test the fit of a one-factor model of SC. This model is presented 
schematically in Figure 3.4, the specification of parameters summarized 
in Table 3.13, and the LISREL input presented in Table 3.14. 
Finally, the selected LISREL output, as with the two-factor model, is 
presented in Table 3.15. 
Examination of goodness-of-fit indices for both the hypothesized two-
factor and one-factor models of SC reveals a clear indication of misspeci-
fled models. Based on these findings, we concluded that SC is a multidi-
mensional construct, which in this study comprised the four facets of 
GSC, ASC, ESC, and MSC.

Summary 
This chapter presented an application of LISREL CF A in testing for the 
factorial structure of a theoretical construct. Specifically, a four-factor 
model of SC was tested against competing two- and one-factor models. 
For each model, the LISREL input was presented, together with related 
tabular and schematic illustrations of relations among the variables. A 
thorough review of the LISREL output provided a guide to the interpreta-
tion of model fit with respect to the model as a whole, and for individual 
model parameters. Finally, problems associated with post hoc model fit-
ting were addressed, and caveats issued regarding the importance of se-
lecting substantively meaningful final models.

Application 2: Validating a Measuring 
Instrument 
Our second application tests hypotheses related to the Self Description 
Questionnaire III (SDQIII; Marsh & O'Neill, 1984), an instrument de-
signed to measure 13 facets of SC: one general SC, three academic SCs 
(English, mathematics, and general school), and nine nonacademic SCs 
(physical ability, physical appearance, social (same sex), social (opposite 
sex), parent relations, emotional stability, problem solving/creative think-
ing, religion/spirituality, and honesty/reliability). Of relevance to the pres-
ent application is the factorial validity of the general and academic SC 
subscales for males only; tests of hypotheses related to factorial invari-
ance will be addressed in Section III. (For details of the study related to 
this application, see Byrne, 1988b.) 
1. The SDQIII: The Measuring Instrument Under Study 
The SDQIII is composed of 136 items that are structured on an eight-
point likert-type scale with responses ranging from" I-Definitely False" 
to "8-Definitely True." The General-self subscale contains 12 items and 
was used to measure general SC. The Academic SC, Verbal SC, and 
Mathematics SC subscales each contain 10 items and were used to mea-
sure general school, English, and mathematics SCs, respectively. 
In testing for the factorial validity of a measuring instrument using CF A 
procedures, the researcher seeks to determine the extent to which items 
designed to assess a particular factor (Le., facet or dimension of a con-
struct) actually do so. In general, subscales of a measuring instrument are 
considered to represent the factors of a construct; all items in a particular 
subscale are therefore expected to load onto that factor. 
In the present application, all analyses were based on item pairs, rather 
than on single items. (An elaboration of the rationale underlying this pro-
cedure, as well as the method of item-pair formation, is detailed in the 
reference article cited for this chapter.) The CFA model hypothesized a 
priori that: responses to the SDQIII could be explained by four factors

(general SC, academic SC, English SC, and mathematics SC), each item-
pair would have a nonzero loading on the SC factor it was designed to 
measure (Le., the target factor), and zero loadings on all other factors 
(Le., nontarget factors), the four factors would be correlated, and the 
uniquenesses for the item-pair variables would be uncorrelated. This 
model is presented schematically in Figure 4.1, and the pattern of parame-
ters to be estimated is detailed in Table 4.1. 
In Table 4.1 we see again that, for purposes of statistical identification, 
the first A of each set of AS designed to measure the same factor was fixed 
to 1.0.

4. Application 2: Validating a Measuring Instrument 
2. LISREL Input 
As in Chapter 3, we'll now transform the model specification into LIS-
REL input statements; this information, together with the data presented 
in correlation matrix form, is presented in Table 4.2. 
Let us now review this model specification in light of our LISREL in-
put statements. 
2.1. The DA Card 
The DA card tells us that there are 21 variables (NI = 21) [six item-pairs 
measuring general SC and five item-pairs measuring each of the three 
academic SCs], the sample size is 455 (NO = 455), and the data are to be 
analyzed as a correlation matrix (MA = KM). The input data are in the 
form of a symmetric correlation matrix (KM SY).

2.2. The MO Card 
The MO card tells us that we are working with an all-X model that con-
sists of 21 X variables (NX=2l) and four latent (~) factors (NK=4), the 
factor loading matrix is full and fixed (LX = FU), the factor variance/co-
variance matrix is symmetric and free (PH = SY), 1 and the error variance/ 
covariance matrix is symmetric and fixed (TD=SY,FI). Note that al-
though the TD matrix has been specified as symmetric and fixed, each 
error variance has been specified as a free parameter [TD( 1,1)-
TD(21,21)]; no error covariances have been specified, thus making this 
specification equivalent to a diagonal matrix (TD=DI,FR). Specification 
of the error matrix as TD = SY,FI, however, acts as a time-saver in the 
event that the researcher wishes to conduct post hoc analyses that include 
correlated errors. 
2.3. The OU Card 
The OU card has specified that no start values are to be provided by the 
program (NS) and that standard errors (SE), T-values (TV), modification 
indices (MI), and a standardized solution (SS) are requested in the output. 
3. LISREL Output 
Discussion of the results will focus on four major aspects of the printout: 
feasibility of the parameter estimates, adequacy of the measurement 
model, goodness-of-fit of the overall model, and goodness-of-fit of indi-
vidual parameter estimates; only portions of the printout related to these 
phenomena are tabled. 
3.1. Feasibility of Parameter Estimates 
The parameter estimates and standard estimates for each of the three ma-
trices are presented in Table 4.3. 
An examination of Table 4.3 reveals all estimates to be acceptable; all 
estimates are positive, no correlations are greater than 1.00 and all matri-
ces have positive definite status (Le., there was no error message indicat-
ing that any matrix was not positive definite), and finally, the standard 
errors range from 0.019 to 0.115. 
IBy default, the LX matrix is specified as fixed, and the PH matrix as free.

3.2. Adequacy of the Measurement Model 
Let us now examine the squared multiple correlations (R2) for each of 
the observed variables (item-pair measurements), and the coefficient of 
determination for the entire model. These values are presented in Table 
4.4.

Looking first at the R2 values, we see that, overall, the observed vari-
ables do a satisfactory job of measuring their target SC factors. Excep-
tions to this general finding, however, are the first pair of items measuring 
academic SC (ASCI) and all item-pairs measuring English SC, which are 
all less than 5.00. While these values are still reasonable, they are indica-
tive of somewhat less reliability than are the other item-pair measure-
ments. 
Considering all item-pairs in combination, we can see by the value of 
the coefficient of determination that the reliability of the measurement 
model as a whole was exceptionally high (0.999). 
3.3. Goodness-of-Fit of Overall Model 
As shown in Table 4.5, the adequacy of the model as a whole in represent-
ing the observed data could bear some improvement. This statement is 
based on the value of the likelihood ratio index (i (I83) = 515.56), the 
GFI (0.825), and the AGFI (0.780). The RMR (0.046) indicates a margin-
ally good fit between the hypothesized (Le., restricted) model and the 
observed data (Le., unrestricted model). 
If, on the other hand, we assess the hypothesized model based on sub-
jective indices of fit, the picture appears somewhat better. For example,

the l/df ratio is 2.82. While this value is not great, it is, nevertheless, 
within the broad range of acceptable values (see Carmines & McIver, 
1981). 
Additionally, a null model was estimated in order to calculate the BBI. 
The likelihood ratio index for this model was l (210) = 5939.91, yielding 
a BBI of 0.913; this value represents a marginally good fit to the data. 
3.4. Goodness-of-Fit of Individual Model Parameters 
Since we now know that the hypothesized model, although not a poor fit 
to the observed data, is really only marginally good, we now need to lo-
cate the area of misfit in the model by examining the fit of individual 
parameters; due to space limitations, only the T-values and MIs are in-
cluded here. This portion of the output is presented in Table 4.6. 
A review of the T-values reveals all parameter estimates to be substan-
tial; the magnitude of all estimates is >2.00, indicating that they are statis-
tically significant and thus essential to the model. 
Looking at the MIs, however, we see that there are six estimates >5.00 
in the factor loading matrix, and 25 >5.00 in the error variance/covariance 
matrix. From a practical perspective, given that we are investigating a 
single measuring instrument, this finding is not totally unexpected. With 
respect to the LX matrix, the MIs reflect, for example, that some items 
are tapping nontarget, as well as target SC factors; considering the known 
moderate correlation among the four SC factors under study here, the 
finding should not be surprising. Likewise, with respect to the TD matrix, 
the MIs indicate correlated measurement errors-again, not an uncom-
mon finding among subscales of the same measuring instrument. Such 
covariation frequently results from random error introduced by a particu-
lar measurement method; one example is that of method effects derived 
from the item format associated with subscales of the same measuring 
instrument. 
Despite the likelihood that these explanations do account for the nu-
merous MIs associated with the present model, it seems appropriate to 
investigate the extent to which the MI parameters, if relaxed, lead to an 
improvement in model fit. One way of determining this information is to 
investigate, under alternate model specifications, substantial changes to

4. Application 2: Validating a Measuring Instrument 
major parameters (AS and <J>s) in the originally hypothesized model. Post 
hoc model fitting of this nature has been termed "sensitivity analysis" 
(Byrne et aI., 1989). 
4. Post Hoc Analyses 
The reader is reminded of the caveats presented in Chapter 3 concerning 
the conduct of post hoc analyses. As noted earlier, such analyses are of 
an exploratory nature and should be subjected to cross-validation with 
independent samples before drawing firm conclusions from their findings. 
As long as the researcher is cognizant of this fact, the conduct of post 
hoc analyses can provide a valuable insight into the model under study. 
One way to think of the post hoc process is as a "sensitivity analysis" 
whereby practical, as well as statistical significance, are taken into ac-
count. Let's now turn to an application of these procedures to the present 
data. 
4.1. Model-Fitting Procedures 
Using the MIs as the primary guide, a series of nested alternative models 
were respecified and reestimated beyond the initially fitted model. In to-
tal, 27 post hoc models were specified; these included 22 error covari-
ances and 5 secondary loadings (item-pair loadings on nontarget factors). 
The model-fitting process was continued until a statistically nonsignifi-
cant model was reached. This final model yielded a llikelihood ratio 
index of 183.75 (p = 0.06); the BBI was 0.969). 
4.2. Sensitivity Analyses 
Although we have determined the model of best fit statistically, the ques-
tion now focuses on the practical significance of these additional parame-
ters (i.e., their importance to the overall meaningfulness of the model). 
Given the known sensitivity of the l statistic to sample size, there is 
always the concern of overfitting the model; that is, fitting the model to 
trivial sample-specific artifacts in the data. 
One way of determining this information is to test the sensitivity of 
major parameters in the model to the addition of the post hoc parameters. 
For example, if the estimates of major parameters undergo no appreciable 
change when minor parameters are added to the model, this is an indica-
tion that the initially hypothesized model is empirically robust; the more 
fitted model therefore represents a minor improvement to an already ade-
quate model and the additional parameters should be deleted from the 
model. If, on the other hand, the major parameters undergo substantial 
alteration, the exclusion of the post hoc parameters may lead to biased 
estimates (Alwin & Jackson, 1980; Joreskog, 1983); the minor parameters 
should therefore be retained in the model. 

5. Summary 
97 
One method of estimating this information is to correlate major parame-
ters (the AS and <l>s) in the baseline model with those in the best-fitting 
post hoc model; this is easily performed by means of SPSSX or any other 
similar computer package. Coefficients close to 1.00 argue for the stabil-
ity of the initial model, and thus the triviality of the minor parameters in 
the post hoc model. In contrast, coefficients that are not close to 1.00 
(say, <0.90) are an indication that the major parameters are adversely 
affected, and thus argues for inclusion of the post hoc parameters in the 
final model. 
This suggestion, however, is intended to serve only as a general guide 
to post hoc model fitting. Clearly, decisions regarding the inclusion or 
exclusion of post hoc parameters must involve the weighing of many addi-
tional factors. Other considerations, for example, might include: the mag-
nitude (mean or median) of secondary loading and/or error covariance 
estimates (values less than 1.5 are considered trivial); differences in incre-
mental fit based on subjective indices, rather than on the l statistic (see 
e.g., Marsh & Hocevar, 1985); and the substantive meaningfulness of the 
model relative to the theory and other empirical research in the area. 
Applied to the present data, the preceding analyses yielded the follow-
ing information: the correlation between the estimated factor loadings of 
the initial and final models was 0.997; the correlation between the esti-
mated variance/covariances of the initial and final models was 0.988; the 
error covariance estimates of the final model, while statistically signifi-
cant, ranged from 0.02 to 0.14 (Md = 0.06, which was considered to be 
relatively minor); the estimated secondary factor loadings, while statisti-
cally significant were also relatively minor, ranging from 0.12 to 0.24 (Md 
= 0.07); and there were no incremental differences between the BBI val-
ues (a BBI = 0.000). This information, together with the fact that, sub-
stantively, these artifacts in the data are not unreasonable when analyses 
are focused on a single measuring instrument, led to the rejection of the 
final post hoc model in favor of the more parsimonious initially hypothe-
sized model as presented in Figure 4.1 and Table 4.1. 
In light of these findings, it was concluded that the SDQIII is a psycho-
metrically sound instrument for measuring multidimensional facets of ad-
olescent SC. 
5. Summary 
This chapter focused on the application of LISREL CF A modeling in the 
validation of a measuring instrument. We examined, in detail, the LIS-
REL input for this model and selected portions of the output. Of particu-
lar importance in this chapter was the conduct of a sensitivity analysis, 
the crucial component of post hoc model-fitting procedures, to determine 
the practical significance of additional parameters to the model.

Validating Multiple Traits Assessed 
by Multiple Methods: The Multitrait-
Multimethod Framework 
In this application, we use LISREL CF A procedures to model hypothe-
ses related to convergent and discriminant validity, two indicators of con-
struct validity (see Campbell & Fiske, 1959). Specifically, we use a LIS-
REL modeling approach to examine data within a multitrait-multimethod 
(MTMM) framework. As such, our analyses now focus on the validity of 
multiple traits assessed by multiple methods. (For details of the study 
related to this application, see Byrne, in press.) 
The mUltiple traits in the present application, once again, are the four 
facets of SC: general SC, academic SC, English SC, and mathematics 
SC. The multiple methods are three different scaling techniques: Likert, 
semantic differential, and Guttman scales, as represented by the SDQIII, 
API, and the SES and SCA, respectively. Although the reference cited 
for this application examines construct validity for both low and high aca-
demically tracked high school students, we will focus on analyses related 
to the low track only; tests for invariance will be addressed in Chapter 6. 
1. Assessment of Construct Validity: 
The MTMM Matrix 
Campbell and Fiske (1959) posited that claims of construct validity must 
be accompanied by evidence of both convergent and discriminant valid-
ity. As such, a measure should correlate highly with other measures to 
which it is theoretically linked (convergent validity) and negligibly with 
those that are theoretically unrelated (discriminant validity). To deter-
mine evidence of construct validity, Campbell and Fiske proposed that 
measures of multiple traits be assessed by mUltiple methods and that all 
trait-method correlations be arranged in an MTMM matrix. 
1.1. The Campbell-Fiske Approach to MTMM Analyses 
The assessment of construct validity then focuses on comparisons among 
three blocks of correlations: scores on the same traits measured by differ-

ent methods (monotrait-heteromethod values, i.e., convergent validity), 
scores on different traits measured by the same method (heterotrait-
monomethod values, i.e., discriminant validity), and scores on different 
traits measured by different methods (heterotrait-heteromethod values, 
i.e., discriminant validity). Specific criteria guide the inspection of these 
values, but will not be discussed here since they are not relevant to the 
present analyses. However, interested readers are referred to Byrne (in 
press) for an extensive discussion of this technique. 
Recently, methodologists have argued that a more sophisticated ap-
proach to assessing construct validity within the MTMM framework is 
the analysis of covariance structures using LISREL modeling proce-
dures. Indeed, the CFA approach has been shown to have several advan-
tages over the Campbell-Fiske approach (see Marsh & Hocevar, 1983; 
Schmitt & Stults, 1986; Widaman, 1985). First the MTMM matrix is ex-
plained in terms of the underlying latent constructs, rather than the ob-
served variables. Second the evaluation of convergent and discriminant 
validities can be made at both the matrix and individual parameter levels. 
Third, hypotheses related to convergent and discriminant validity can be 
tested statistically, based on a series of hierarchically nested models. Fi-
nally, separate estimates of variance due to traits, methods, and unique-
ness are provided. 
1.2. The LISREL Approach to MTMM Analyses 
The first step in analyzing data within an MTMM framework is to formu-
late a LISREL model that comprises both the trait and method factors. 
In the present application, we have four traits and three methods, yielding 
a seven-factor model. A schematic presentation of this model is illus-
trated in Figure 5.1 and the related pattern of parameters is shown in 
Tabie 5.1. 
Compared with our two previous applications, we can see that this 
model represents a more complex structure; three aspects of the parame-
ter specifications are important to note. First, each observed variable (the 
Xs) loads on two factors-a trait as well as a method factor. Second, 
in contrast with our two previous applications, the first A of each set of 
congeneric measures in the factor loading matrix (A) is not fixed to 1.0 
for purposes of identification. Alternatively, each trait (<1>11 to <1>44) and 
method (<1>55 to <1>77) factor variance has been fixed to 1.0 for the same 
purpose. Third, as recommended (Schmitt & Stults, 1986; Widaman, 
1985), the trait-method factors l have been fixed to 0.0 to alleviate prob-
IThe trait-method correlations are represented by: PH(5,l), PH(6,l), PH(7,l), 
PH(5,2), PH(6,2), PH(7,2), PH(5,3), PH(6,3), PH(7,3), PH(5,4), PH(6,4), and 
PH(7,4).

lems related to identification and estimation. Finally, both the traits and 
the methods are specified as being correlated among themselves. 2 
To test this seven-factor model for evidence of convergent and discrim-
inant validity, we compare it against a series of more restrictive models 
in which specific parameters have either been eliminated or constrained 
to equal zero. Since the difference in l(Axf is itself l-distributed with 
degrees of freedom equal to the difference in degrees of freedom for the 
two models, the fit differential between comparison models can be tested 
statistically. A significant Al argues for the superiority of the less restric-
tive model. (For a more extensive discussion of these alternative models 
and their comparisons, see Widaman, 1985.) 
A total of eight models, in addition to the hypothesized seven-factor 
model, are specified in the present application; five are used to make 
comparisons related to convergent and discriminant validity and three to 
determine the degree of method bias associated with each scaling method. 
Before examining these model comparisons, however, let us first study 
the LISREL input and output for the proposed seven-factor model. 
2The trait correlations are represented by PH(2,1), PH(3,1), PH(4,1), PH(3,2), 
PH(4,2), and PH(4,3); the method correlations are represented by PH(6,5), 
PH(7,5), and PH(7,6).

2. LISREL Input 
Translation of the pattern of parameter estimates into LISREL input 
statements for this model (see Table 5.1) is presented in Table 5.2; the 
data correlation matrix of means and standard deviations is also included. 
We begin by reviewing this MTMM model specification in light of our 
LISREL input statements. 
2.1. The DA Card 
Although the DA card tells us that there are 15 variables (NI = 15), only 
12 are used in the present application; thus, the SE card is used. (Recall 
from Chapter 3 that the other three variables, academic scores, are not 
included in these analyses). We see also that the sample size is 252 (NO

= 252) and that the data are to be analyzed as a correlation matrix (MA 
= KM). Finally, the input data are in the form of a symmetric correlation 
matrix (KM SY). 
2.2. The MO Card 
The MO card tells us that we are working with an all-X model that con-
sists of 12 X variables (NX = 12) and 7 latent (~) factors (NK = 7); the 
factor loading matrix is full and fixed (LX = FU); the factor variance/co-
variance matrix is symmetric and free (PH = SY); and the error variance/ 
covariance matrix is diagonal and free (TD=DI).3 In Chapter 4, it was 
noted that specification of the error matrix as TD = SY, FI, can act as a 
time-saver in the event that the researcher wishes to conduct post hoc 
analyses that include correlated errors. The error matrix has not been 
specified in this way here because in MTMM applications, model fitting 
beyond the initially hypothesized model leads to innumerable problems 
related to estimation and other considerations; thus, post hoc model fit-
ting is not recommended (Widaman, 1985). 
2.3. The OU Card 
The OU Card has specified that no start values are to be provided by the 
program (NS), and that standard errors (SE), T-values (TV), and modifi-
cation indices (MI) are to be printed in the output. 
3. LISREL Output 
The assessment of convergent and discriminant validity can be deter-
mined in two major ways: examination of individual parameters repre-
senting trait and method factors, and the comparison of MTMM models. 
Since the model comparison approach requires the input of a series of 
alternatively specified models, we shall leave this procedure until later, 
and we turn now to the the evaluation of individual parameters. We first 
examine, however, the goodness of fit for the overall hypothesized seven-
factor model. 
3.1. Goodness-of-Fit of the Overall Model 
The overall fit of this model, based on the X2 likelihood ratio index, was 
slightly less than optimal (X~33) = 105.21), indicating some degree of misfit 
in the model. However, as noted earlier, post hoc model fitting ofMTMM 
3Recall that PH = SY and TD = DI represent free matrices by default.

models is problematic and not recommended. 4 Goodness-of-fit values for 
the whole model are presented in Table 5.3. 
3.2. Evidence of Convergent and Discriminant Validities 
Assessments of trait- and method-related variance can be ascertained by 
examining individual parameter estimates; we now focus on this mode 
of determining evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. These 
values, together with the standard errors, are summarized in Table 5.4; 
statistical significance, as determined by the T-values, is indicated by 
means of asterisks. 
The magnitude of the trait loadings provides an indication of conver-
gent validity. As indicated in Table 5.4, all loadings were substantial and 
statistically significant. We can conclude from these results that each trait 
factor was well defined by the hypothesized model. 
Except for the measurement of academic SC by the Guttman scale (AIO,7 
= 0.73), method factors tended to have weak to moderate loadings; only 
7 of the 12 parameters were significant. These results indicate that 
method bias effects, while present to a moderate degree for each of the 
scales, was really only problematic in the measurement of academic SC 
by the SCA. 
Discriminant validity of traits and methods are determined by examin-
ing their respective factor correlation matrices. Looking first at trait dis-
crimination, we see that, except for correlations between English and ac-
ademic SC (0.72) and between mathematics and English SC (0.08), only 
a modest claim of discriminant validity can be made. This finding, how-
4Since the largest MI pointed to an error covariance between the APIESC and 
APIMSC, one further model was estimated in which TD(87) was specified as free. 
However, as predicted by Widaman, problems of convergence curtailed the esti-
mation of parameters.

5. Validating Multiple Traits Assessed by Multiple Methods 
ever, is consistent with current SC literature. In this regard, Marsh and 
Hocevar (1983) have noted that only when correlations are extreme (i.e., 
approach unity) should researchers be concerned about a lack of discrimi-
nant validity. As such, claims of discriminant validity of the traits in the 
present data appear justified. Additionally, Marsh and Hocevar have ar-
gued that the trait correlations should be consistent with the underlying 
theory. In this regard, the trait correlations are consistent with the Sha-
velson et al. (1976) hierarchical model of SC and with other empirical 
findings in the SC research (see e.g., Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988). 
From the results presented in Table 5.4 we can conclude that discrimi-
nant validity among the method factors was reasonably good. These find-
ings suggest that, for the most part, method effects associated with each 
measurement scale were fairly independent of the other measurement 
methods incorporated in the model. 
4. Comparison of MTMM Models 
We turn our attention now to the assessment of convergent and discrimi-
nant validity by means of comparisons between pairs of alternatively 
specified models. Of particular interest are comparisons between the hy-
pothesized seven-factor model and other more restrictive models. The 
seven-factor model serves as the baseline model since it represents hy-
pothesized relations among the traits and methods, and typically demon-
strates the best fit to the data; it is the least restrictive model, having 
both correlated traits and correlated methods. The models presented here 
follow from the work of Widaman (1985). 
We will first examine the LISREL input for each comparison model; 
only the statements beginning with the MO card will be included here 
since the first six cards remain the same for all models. To assist the 
reader in conceptualizing the pattern of model parameters, the LISREL 
numbered summary of parameter specifications will accompany each 
model input. This information will be followed by a summary of good-
ness-of-fit statistics for each model and the results of all model compar-
isons. 
4.1. LISREL Input for Comparison Models 
Modell (see Table 5.5) represents the null model and, as such, is the 
most restrictive of all the models. It hypothesizes that each observed vari-
able is an independent factor (NX = 12; NK = 12); such independence thus 
precludes correlations among the factors (PH = SY ,FI). Furthermore, 
since this leaves no indicator variables in the factor loading matrix, Ax is 
specified as zero (LX = ZE). Finally, the error variance/covariance matrix 
is specified as a diagonal matrix (TD = DI).

ModeL 2 (see Table 5.6) is postulated to have four trait factors that are 
allowed to correlate; no method factors are specified.5 As such, the model 
is specified as having 12 observed variables (NX = 12) that measure four 
latent factors (NK = 4). The factor variance/covariance matrix (<I» is spec-
ified as symmetric and fixed (PH = SY,FI) with the variances fixed to 1.00 
for identification purposes and the covariances left unconstrained [FR 
PH(2,1)---PH(4,3)]. 
51n fact, the same results are obtained if the model is specified as a seven-factor 
model, allowing the trait factors to remain fixed at 0.0. This will be illustrated 
with Model 5.

Model 3 (see Table S.7) is hypothesized as having seven factors (NK 
= 7): four correlated trait factors and three uncorrelated (i.e., orthogonal) 
method factors. Thus, while the trait factors are specified as free, the 
method factors are left fixed at 0.0 by default (PH = SY,FI). 
Model 4 (see Table S.2) is the hypothesized seven-factor model dis-
cussed earlier.Model 5 (see Table S.8) postulates a three-factor model 
(NK = 3) with three correlated method factors; no trait factors are speci-
fied. Thus in the Phi matrix, the factor covariances are specified as free 
[PH(2,2), PH(3,2)]. 
Model 6 (see Table S.9) postulated a seven-factor model with trait fac-
tors perfectly correlated as indicated by the start values for the trait co-
variances [ST 1.00 PH(2.1)---PH(4,3)] and method factors allowed to 
correlate freely [FR PH(6,S) PH(7,S) PH(7,6)]. 
In order to determine the extent to which each measurement scale was 
contributing to method bias, three additional models were postulated for 
comparison purposes. These are as follows. 
In Model 7 (see Table S.lO), the Likert scale has been deleted. Thus, 
although it is specified as a seven-factor model, factor loadings for the 
Likert scale [LX(1,S) LX(2,S) LX(3,S) LX(4,S)] and correlations between 
the Likert and the other scales [PH(6,S) PH(7,S)] have been fixed to 0.0. 
Here again, this model, as well as Models 8 and 9 could have been alterna-

tively specified as six-factor models; as such, it would not be necessary 
to constrain the deleted scale parameters to 0.0. 
In Model 8 (see Table 5.11), the semantic differential scale has been 
deleted. Accordingly, the related parameters have been fixed to 0.0 
[LX(5,6) LX(6,6) LX(7,6) LX8,6) PH(6,5) PH(7,6»). 
Finally, in Model 9 (see Table 5.12), the Guttman scale has been elimi-
nated. As such, the following parameters were fixed to 0.0: LX(9,7) 
LXOO,7) LX01,7) LX02,7) PH(7,5) PH(7,6). Note that here, the ~s are 
fixed to 0.0 by default. 
Goodness-of-fit indices for each of these MTMM models are summa-
rized in Table 5.13. As shown here, Modell, the most restrictive model, 
serves as a null model against which competing models are compared in 
order to determine the BBI. As expected, the hypothesized seven-factor 
model (Model 4) exhibited the best fit to the data. 
4.2. Results of MTMM Model Comparisons 
All model comparisons, together with their goodness-of-fit indices are

Let's begin with a comparison of models to determine the strength of 
added components in the hypothesized model. For example, by compar-
ing Model 3 with Model 4, we can determine the impact of correlations 
among the method factors (as with comparisons between Models 2 and 
3). By so doing, we see that although Model 4 hypothesizes correlations 
among both the trait and method factors, method correlations appear to 
be relatively weak (AX~3) = 9.48; p <0.05; Alldf = 0.0; ABBI = 0.02). 
These results suggest minimal method-related variance in that the three 
measurement scales are operating independently and support findings 
from our earlier investigation of the individual method parameters. 
To test for convergent validity, we now compare Model 4 with Model 
5 in which no trait factors are specified. A significant difference between 
these two models argues for the presence of trait factors, and thus for 
evidence of convergent validity. As shown in Table 5.14, the Al was 
highly significant, thus providing strong evidence of convergent validity 
for the trait factors. 
Since the discriminant validity of traits argues for their zero intercorre-
lations, evidence of same can be tested by comparing the baseline model 
(Model 4) with one in which perfect correlations among traits are hypoth-
esized (Model 6). The highly significant difference resulting from this

comparison argues for strong evidence of discriminant validity for the 
traits in the hypothesized model. The discriminant validity of method fac-
tors (i.e., no method bias) can be tested by comparing Model 4 with 
Model 2 in which no method factors are specified. While this comparison 
yielded a statistically significant ~l, suggesting evidence of method bias, 
this effect was substantially weaker than that related to the trait factors. 
Finally, to determine the extent to which each measurement scale is 
contributing to the method bias, we can compare Model 4 with Models 
7,8, and 9 in which the Likert, semantic differential, and Guttman scales, 
respectively, have been deleted. These results show significant method 
effects for the Likert and Guttman scales; those associated with the se-
mantic differential were not significant. Overall, the Likert scale appears 
to be the heaviest contributor to method bias. It must be pointed out, 
however, that these three model comparisons were conducted for illustra-
tive purposes only. In actual fact, differences in the SUbjective fit indices 
demonstrated negligible method effects.

5, Summary 
This chapter focused on the analysis of a multitrait-multimethod matrix 
using the LISREL methodology in determining evidence of convergent 
and discriminant validity. Two possible means to deriving this evaluative 
information were demonstrated: the examination of individual parameters 
related to trait and methods factors and the comparison of alternatively 
specified models in which various aspects of construct validity are con-
sidered. Finally, the comparison of competing models was used to iden-
tify the extent of method bias associated with particular measuring instru-
ments. 

Section III Multigroup Analyses 

6 
Testing for Measurement and 
Structural Invariance 
of a Theoretical Construct 
In this section, we focus on the analysis of CF A models comprising two 
groups of subjects. Of primary interest are procedures involved in testing 
for the invariance (i.e., equivalence) of measurements and/or structure 
across two or more groups. 
In our first multigroup application, we test hypotheses related to equiv-
alencies across gender related to multiple SC measurements and the fac-
torial structure of a multidimensional SC comprising general SC, aca-
demic SC, English SC, and mathematics SC. This work follows from the 
previous study examined in Application 1, Section II. (For details of the 
study related to this application, see Byrne & Shavelson, 1987.) 
1. Testing for Factorial Invariance: 
The General Framework 
1.1. Preliminary Single-Group Analyses 
As a prerequisite to testing for factorial invariance, it is convenient to 
consider a baseline model that is estimated separately for each group. 
As noted in Section II, this model represents the most parsimonious, yet 
substantively most meaningful and best-fitting model to the data. Since 
the goodness-of-fit value and its corresponding degrees of freedom are 
additive, the sum of the ls reflects how well the underlying factor struc-
ture fits the data across groups. 
However, since instruments are often group-specific in the way they 
operate, baseline models are not expected to be identical across groups. 
For example, whereas the baseline model for one group might include 
correlated measurement errors and/or secondary factor loadings, this 
may not be so for a second group. A priori knowledge of such group 
differences, as will be illustrated later, is critical to the conduct of invari-
ance testing procedures. Although the bulk of the literature suggests that 
the number of factors must be equivalent across groups before further 
tests of invariance can be conducted, this is only a logical starting point, 

126 
6. Testing for Measurement and Structural Invariance 
not a necessary condition; only the comparable parameters within the 
same factor need be equated (Werts, Rock, Linn, & Joreskog, 1976). 
Since the estimation of baseline models involves no between-group 
constraints, the data may be analyzed separately for each group. In test-
ing for invariance, however, constraints are imposed on particular param-
eters, and thus the data from all groups must be analyzed simultaneously 
to obtain efficient estimates (Joreskog & SorbOm, 1985); the pattern of 
fixed and free parameters remaining consistent with that specified in the 
baseline model for each group. 
Tests of factorial invariance, then, can involve both measurement and 
structural components of a model. In LISREL notation, this means that 
the factor (lambda, A), error (theta, 8), and latent factor variance-covari-
ance (phi, CP) matrices are of primary interest. If, however, the invariance 
testing includes factor means, then the regression intercept (nu v) and 
mean (gamma, f) vectors are also of interest; this issue is addressed in 
Application 6 (see Chapter 8). 
1.2. Subsequent Multigroup Analyses 
Tests of factorial invariance can begin with an overall test of the equality 
of covariance structures across groups (i.e., Ho: II = I2 = ... IG where 
G is the number of groups). As such, failure to reject the null hypothesis 
is interpreted as evidence of invariance across groups; except for mean 
structures, the groups can be treated as one. This means, then, that the 
variance-covariance matrices can be pooled and that subsequent investi-
gative inquiry would be based on single-group analyses; there is no need 
to analyze each group separately or simultaneously. Rejection of this hy-
pothesis, on the other hand, argues for the testing of a series of increas-
ingly restrictive hypotheses in order to identify the source of nonequiva-
lence. 
Unfortunately, the global test of invariant variance-covariance matri-
ces, while seemingly straightforward and reasonable, often leads to con-
tradictory findings thereby contributing more to confusion than to enlight-
enment with respect to equivalencies across groups. For example, 
sometimes this initial hypothesis is found tenable, yet subsequent tests 
for the invariance of particular measurement and/or structural parameters 
must be rejected (see e.g., Joreskog, 1971a). Conversely, this initial hy-
pothesis may be rejected, yet the measurement and/or measurement pa-
rameters may be found to be group-invariant. Thus, while Joreskog sug-
gested that the global hypothesis of equivalent covariance matrices be 
tested first, before proceeding to more specific hypotheses, he is nonethe-
less cognizant of various problems associated with its application. Fur-
thermore, Rock, Werts, and Flaugher (1978) have advocated that even if 
this hypothesis cannot be rejected, the researcher should still conduct 
subsequent tests for the invariance of particular parameters. 
Such inconsistencies in the omnibus test of invariance derive from the 

2. Tests for Invariance Related to Self-Concept 
127 
fact that there is no baseline model for the test of invariant variance-co-
variance matrices. As a result, this test becomes much more stringent 
than is the case with subsequent tests of invariance related to the factors 
(Muthen, personal communication, Oct. 1988). Consequently, Mutben 
contends that in general the omnibus test is of little import or assistance 
in testing for invariance across groups, and thus is not a necessary prereq-
uisite to the conduct of relatedly more specific hypotheses bearing on 
factorial invariance. 
Let us now continue, then, with tests of hypotheses related to factorial 
invariance. Specifically, these hypotheses focus on the invariance of: (1) 
the number of factors (i.e., Ho: AIK = AZK = ... A GK , where k = number 
of factors); (2) the factor-loading pattern (i.e., Ho: AI = Az = ... AG); 
(3) the factor variances and covariances (Le., Ho: ct>1 = ct>z = ... ct>a>; 
and (4) the error/uniquenesses (Le., Ho: 8 1 = 8 z = ... 8 G ). The tenabil-
ity of Hypotheses 1 and 2 is a logical prerequisite to the testing of Hypoth-
eses 3 and 4. 
The procedures for testing the invariance hypotheses are identical to 
those used in model fitting. That is, a model in which certain parameters 
are constrained to be equal across groups is compared with a less restric-
tive model in which these same parameters are free to take on any value. 
For example, the hypothesis of an invariant pattern offactor loadings (A) 
can be tested by constraining all corresponding lambda parameters to be 
equal across groups, and then comparing this model with one in which 
the number of factors and pattern of loadings are invariant, but not con-
strained equal (i.e., the summed i across groups). If the difference in i 
(di) is not significant, the hypothesis of an invariant pattern of loadings 
is considered tenable. 
2. Tests for Invariance Related to Self-Concept 
In our first two-group application, then, we begin by establishing a well-
fitting baseline model separately for males and females. But first, let's 
examine the model to be tested. 
2.1. The Hypothesized Model 
The hypothesized model in the present application is identical to the one 
examined in Chapter 3 (see Tables 3.2 and 3.3); as such, the API has been 
deleted as one measure of ASC. To recapitulate, this model hypothesizes 
a priori that: SC responses can be explained by four factors (general SC, 
academic SC, English SC, and mathematics SC); each sub scale measure 
has a nonzero loading on the SC factor that it is designed to measure 
(i.e., target loading) and a zero loading on all other factors (i.e., nontarget 
loadings); the four SC factors, consistent with the theory (see e.g., Byrne 

128 
6. Testing for Measurement and Structural Invariance 
& Shavelson, 1986), are correlated; and error/uniqueness terms for each 
of the measures are uncorrelated. To refresh our memory of the model to 
be tested here, let's review Table 3.3 which summarizes the pattern of 
parameters to be estimated. Recall that the AS, <!>s, and 80s represent the 
parameters to be estimated and the Os and 1 s are fixed a priori; and for 
purposes of identification, the first of each congeneric set of SC measures 
is fixed to 1.0, each nontarget loading is fixed to 0.0. A schematic presen-
tation of the model to be tested is shown in Figure 6.1.

129 
2.2. The Baseline Models 
Using the procedures outlined in Chapter 3, alternative models were se-
quentially respecified and reestimated until a well-fitting model, both sta-
tistically and substantively, was found for each sex. These baseline mod-
els demonstrate a satisfactory fit to the data for both males (lldf = 1.97; 
BBI = 0.98) and females (lldf = 2.27; BBI = 0.98).1 
In fitting the baseline model for each sex, a substantial drop in X2 was 
found when the English SC subscale of the SDQ was free to load on gen-
eral SC. Furthermore, for males only, the mathematics SC subscale of 
the SDQ was allowed to load on the English SC factor. 2 Finally, errorl 
uniquenesses between subscales of the same measuring instrument were 
allowed to covary, resulting in five error covariances for males and three 
for females. These baseline models are shown schematically in Figure 
6.2. 
3. LISREL Input for Multigroup Analyses 
As noted earlier, when the analyses focus on multigroup comparisons 
with constraints between the groups (i.e., certain parameters are con-
strained equal), it is imperative that the parameters be estimated simulta-
neously.3 To this end, in the present application, we now combine our 
male and female files into one, such that the specifications for each group 
are stacked one after the other (i.e., the model specifications for males 
are presented first, followed by the model specifications for females) and 
these specifications are consistent with the established baseline model for 
each sex (see Figure 6.2). 
3.1. The DA Card 
A multiple group specification requires three modifications to the basic 
setup as it relates to single-group analyses; these are as follows. 
lAs noted in Byrne & Shavelson (1987), several alternative models were estimated 
beyond this point yielding statistically better fitting models for both males (X2/df 
= 1.33; BBI = 0.99) and females (X2/df = 1.58; BBI = 0.99). These models, 
however, allowed for error covariances between subscales of different measuring 
instruments. Clearly, such covariation does not make sense psychometrically. 
These models were thus rejected in favor ofthe more substantively sound baseline 
models presented here. 
2From a substantive point of view, this factor loading is difficult to explain. How-
ever, as noted in our summary of the study, we strongly suspect that this effect 
will disappear upon replication. 
3KM was specified in estimating model parameters for males and females. Thus, 
the KM specification was changed to CM in testing for invariance across sex. In 
order for the analyses to be based on the covariance matrix, the standard devia-
tions must be added below the correlation data matrix.

1. The number of groups (NG) must be specified for the first group. In 
the present case, it would be specified as NG = 2. 
2. The matrix to be analyzed must be the covariance matrix (CM), rather 
than the correlation matrix (KM) as demonstrated for the single-group 
analyses (see e.g., Table 3.2); this specification is made for the first 
group only and reads MA = CM. 
3. The only information required on the DA card of the second group 
relates to the number of observations expected (N =420). 
These stacked specifications for males and females, based on their 
baseline models, are presented in Table 6.1.

3.2. The MO Card 
Before we can proceed further in testing for invariance, we must learn 
additional LISREL specification language, which is needed for the MO 
card; this information is now summarized. 
1. The specification of any matrix element in a current group, contains 
only two indices within parentheses (e.g., LX(2,1). To refer to a matrix 
element in some other group, however, there must be three indices within 
parentheses, where the first number refers to the number of the group. 
For example, the specification of LX(2,2, 1) refers to the element LX(2,1) 
in the second group; LX(3,2,l), to the element LX(2,l) for the third 
group, and so on. 
2. In defining equality constraints between groups, the parameter to be 
constrained is specified as free in the first group and as equated (EQ) to 
the first group for each of the other groups. For example, in testing for 
the invariance of LX(2, 1) across three groups, the specification would be: 
In group 1: FR LX(2,l). 
In group 2: EQ LX(1,2,l) LX(2,l). 
In group 3: EQ LX(1,2,l) LX(2,l). 

4. Testing Hypotheses Related to Factorial Invariance 
133 
According to this specification, LX(2,1) will be freely estimated for 
group 1 only; for groups 2 and 3, the value of LX(2,1) will be constrained 
equal to the value obtained for group 1. 
3. To constrain an entire matrix (Le., all elements in the matrix) invari-
ant across groups, the matrix of interest can itself be specified as invariant 
(IN) on the MO card. That is to say, to constrain LX in group 2 equal to 
LX for group 1, we would specify LX=IN. It is worth noting, however, 
that this specification at the LX matrix level is identical to a specification 
wherein each element in the LX matrix for group 2 is specified as equiva-
lent (EQ) to each element in the LX matrix for group 1 (as explained 
earlier). For example, in the case of our present data, the specification 
LX = IN is equivalent to the following specification with respect to indi-
vidual elements of LX: 
EQ LX(1, 1,1) LX(1, 1) 
EQ LX(1 ,2, 1) LX(2,1) 
t 
EQ LX(1,II,4) LX(11,4) 
4. Additionally, if start values were included for the initial baseline 
model input, they may need to be increased in order to make them com-
patible with covariance, rather than correlation values. In the case of the 
present data, for example, the start values for the fixed AS were changed 
from 1.00 to 30.00, and the free AS from 0.90 to 15.0. 
5. Finally, the following matrix specifications can be described on the 
MO card: 
SP-indicates that the matrix has the same pattern of fixed and free ele-
ments as the corresponding matrix in the previous group. 
SS-indicates that the matrix will be given the same starting values as 
the corresponding matrix in the previous group. 
PS-indicates that the same pattern and starting values will be used as in 
the corresponding matrix of the previous group. 
3.3. The OU Card 
Specification on this card remains consistent with other models described 
in Section II. In other words, whether or not the analyses are based on 
single or multiple groups has no bearing on the requested output. 
4. Testing Hypotheses Related to Factorial Invariance 
Now we are ready to test the series of hypotheses related to the invari-
ance of SC measurements and structure across gender. Let's proceed by 
examining, one at a time, the model specification input and results associ-
ated with each of these hypotheses. For purposes of demonstration, the 

134 
6. Testing for Measurement and Structural Invariance 
omnibus test of invariant variance-covariance matrices will be conducted. 
However, you are urged to refer to the earlier discussion regarding the 
rationale and problems associated with this test. 
4.1. Hypothesis 1 (Ho: IM = IF) 
The first hypothesis to be tested is the global one that relates to the equiv-
alence of the variance-covariance matrices across sex. As noted by Jore-
skog (l971a), one hopes to be able to reject this hypothesis in order to 
argue that the covariance matrices for males and females are significantly 
different. The input for this model, related only to the MO card (all other 
input remains the same) is as follows: 
Males: 
MO NX= 11 NK= 11 LX=ID TD=ZE 
Females: MO PH = IN4 
For males, the model specified here considers each measure to repre-
sent one factor (i.e., an ll-factor model), with the factor loading matrix 
specified as an identity matrix (i.e., each measure has exactly one fixed 
loading for exactly one factor), and the error variance-covariance matrix, 
a zero matrix (i.e., a null matrix). The model specification for females 
is exactly the same, with the added restriction that the factor variance-
covariance matrix is invariant. 
The hypothesis of invariant covariance matrices was rejected (l (66) 
= 138.80, p<O.OOl). These results imply that for adolescent males and 
females, SC structure differs with respect to: the number offactors under-
lying SC, the pattern of factor loadings (i.e., SC measurements of the SC 
factors under study), and/or the variance of the SC factors and/or their 
covariances (i.e., relations among the SC factors under study). We pro-
ceed now to test hypotheses related to each of these possibilities by test-
ing a series of increasingly restrictive models. 
4.2. Hypothesis 2 (Ho:A M.K = 4 = A F,K = 4) 
The second hypothesis to be tested is that the number of factors underly-
ing the SC structure, as postulated in Figure 6.1, is invariant across sex 
(i.e., a four-factor structure). The decision to reject or not to reject this 
hypothesis is based on the overall goodness-of-fit between the simultane-
ous model and the data; a satisfactory fit arguing for a factor structure 
that includes the same number of factors in each group. Unlike single-
group analyses, multigroup analyses yield only one overalll value, albeit 
separate GFI and RMR measures for each group. Since the l values are 
4Where model specifications for the second and all subsequent groups are the 
same as the first group, these specifications need not be included in the MO card 
(i.e., for females, NX= II NK= II LX=ID TD=ZE). 

4. Testing Hypotheses Related to Factorial Invariance 
135 
summative across groups, the value obtained in the multigroup specifica-
tion should equal the sum of i values obtained for the single-group analy-
ses. The model specification input for testing this hypothesis, then, is 
identical to that presented in Table 6.1. As such, parameter specification 
is consistent with the baseline model for each group; the only difference 
is the simultaneous, rather than the separate, estimation of parameters. 
The results of this analysis yielded a i (65) = 138.26; this value, of 
course, is equal to the sum of the separate goodness-of-fit indices for 
males (i (31) = 60.96) and females (i (34) = 77.30). As such, the four-
factor solution is considered to represent a substantively reasonable fit to 
the data (i/df = 2.13; BBI = 0.98). As a case in point regarding the 
sensitivity of i to trivial differences between comparative models, it is 
worthwhile to note that on the basis of statistical criteria, this model 
would be rejected (p<0.001). Interestingly, McGaw and Joreskog (1971), 
presented with similar findings, argued for an invariant number of factors 
(i.e., nonrejection of Hypothesis 2) based on a Tucker-Lewis index equal 
to 0.94.5 Given the substantially poorer model fit in their data, it seems 
justifiable, and indeed reasonable here, to conclude that a four-factor 
structure underlies the data in the present application. 
Nonetheless, while these results suggest that for both males and fe-
males, the data are fairly well described by general SC, academic SC, 
English SC, and mathematics SC, they do not necessarily imply that the 
actual factor loadings are the same across sex. Thus, the hypothesis of 
an invariant pattern of factor loadings remains to be tested; we tum now 
to this issue. 
4.3. Hypothesis 3 (Ho: AM = AF) 
The hypothesis to be tested here argues that all measurement scaling units 
(i.e., the factor loadings) for each SC factor, as specified in Figure 6.2 are 
equivalent across sex (except for the additional cross-loading for males 
[A93]). In other words, the pattern of factor loadings is invariant. A more 
explicit expansion of this hypothesis is shown in Figure 6.3. 
The testing of Hypothesis 3, as well as subsequent hypotheses related 
to invariance, is identical to those used in the model-fitting procedures 
demonstrated in Chapters 3 and 4. That is, a model is estimated in which 
the i parameters are constrained to be equal across gender; the resulting 
goodness-of-fit is then compared with that of a less restrictive model in 
which the same parameters are free to take on any value. The tenability 
of the hypothesis rests on the statistical significance of the t1i, between 
the two models. 
In specifying this model, the input for the female group only is of inter-
5 As with the BBI, the Tucker-Lewis Index ranges from 0.0 to 1.00, values closest 
to 1.00 representing the best fit to the data.

Gender. 
est. This is because in our stacked data setup, the female data are pre-
sented in the second group; by convention, the second group is con-
strained equal to the first group (i.e., model specifications for males 
remain consistent with those presented in Table 6.1). Since there is one 
factor loading that is already known to be noninvariant across the two 
groups (A93), we cannot constrain the entire A matrix invariant by using 
the specification LX=IN. We thus specify a model that constrains all AS 
except A93• The LISREL input, for females only, is presented in Table 
6.2. 
To recapitulate, the hypothesis of an invariant pattern of factor load-
ings was tested by constraining all A parameters except A93 to be equal, 
and then comparing this model (Model 2) with Model 1 in which only the 
number of factors was held invariant. The fit of our constrained model 
yielded a l (73) = 145.37. Since the difference in l was not significant 
(Lll (8) = 7.11), the hypothesis of an invariant pattern offactor loadings 
was considered tenable. If, however, this hypothesis had been rejected, 
the next step would have been to proceed by testing, independently, the 
invariance of each factor loading (A) in the factor-loading matrix (A). (This

4.4. Hypothesis 4 (Ho: <PM = <PF) 
The hypothesis to be tested here bears on the structure of the SC con-
struct by focusing on the invariance of the SC factor variance-covariance 
matrix across sex. Specifically, it argues for the group equivalence of the 
variance associated with each SC facet and relations (i. e., covariances) 
among the SC facets. As noted earlier, hypotheses related to invariance

involve increasingly restrictive models; as such, the model to be tested 
here (Model 3) is more restrictive than Model 2. In addition to the specifi-
cation of constraints between AS, Model 3 also includes the restriction 
that the entire factor variance-covariance matrix (<I» be constrained in-
variant across sex (PH = IN). The LISREL input for Model 3, again for 
females only, is presented in Table 6.3. 
The fit of Model 3 with the data yielded a X2 (83) = 195.30. Since the 
difference in l between this model and Model 2 was statistically signifi-
cant (~l (10) = 49.93, p<O.OOl), the hypothesis of equivalent SC struc-
ture was rejected. The strategy at this point was to isolate those compo-
nents of SC structure that were noninvariant across sex. To determine

this information, it was necessary to test, independently, the invariance 
of each parameter in the phi matrix. As such, Model 4 was specified with 
the variance of general SC (<1>11) constrained equal [EQ PH(l,I,l) 
PH(1,l)], in addition to the parameters known to be invariant across the 
groups. The LISREL input, for females only, is presented in Table 6.4. 
Since the difference in fit between this model (Model 4) and Model 2, 
in which only the factor loadings were held invariant, was not significant 
(aX2 (1) = 1.15), the hypothesis of equivalent variance in general SC was 
considered tenable. In like manner, a series of subsequent models were

specified in which each of the remaining parameters in the <I> matrix was 
constrained equal across sex. Overall, tests of hypotheses related to the 
equivalence of SC structure revealed significant gender differences in the 
variance of academic SC, and with respect to relations between: mathe-
matics SC and general SC, mathematics SC and academic SC, and mathe-
matics SC and English SC. A summary of the testing of all hypotheses 
related to the invariance of SC measurements and structure across gender 
is presented in Table 6.5. 
Given the differences between males and females illustrated in Table 
6.5, invariance of the error variance-covariance matrices was not for-
mally tested. Although Joreskog (l971a) suggested that the hypothesis of 
an invariant variance-covariance matrix (<I» be tested conditional on the 
findings of an invariant number of factors, factor-loading pattern, and er-
ror variances, this restriction is excessively stringent and not always nec-
essary (MutMn, personal communication, Jan. 1986; Alwin & Jackson, 
1980).

5. Summary 
This chapter demonstrated how to test hypotheses related to factorial in-
variance across groups. Specifically, procedures were demonstrated that 
tested for the gender invariance of a multidimensional adolescent SC 
structure as measured by multiple measuring instruments. The first step 
was to fit a hypothesized four-factor model of SC separately for males 
and females. We next combined the two baseline models and proceeded 
to test hypotheses related to the invariance of SC measures (i.e., factor 
loadings) and SC structure (i.e., factor variances and covariances). Fi-
nally, procedures used in testing for and with partial measurement invari-
ance were illustrated.

Testing for Item Invariance 
of a Measuring Instrument 
In this second multigroup application, our attention focuses on invariance 
as it relates to a single measuring instrument, the Self Description Ques-
tionnaire (SDQIII; Marsh & O'Neill, 1984). In this chapter we explore 
the factorial equivalency of the SDQIII across two academically tracked 
(low and high) groups of high school students. (For a more extensive dis-
cussion of academic tracking as it relates to this data base, see Byrne, 
1988a; for details of the study related to this application, see Byrne, 
1988c.) 
Typically, in testing for the factorial invariance of a single measuring 
instrument, the researcher is primarily interested in three psychometric 
issues: that the items comprising each subscale are factorially valid and 
equivalent across groups, that the factor covariances (i.e., relations 
among the underlying construct dimensions) are equivalent across 
groups, and that the subscale items are equally reliable across groups. 
This chapter addresses each of these issues. Specifically, it illustrates 
the testing of hypotheses bearing on the equivalency of the SDQIII across 
academic track; consistent with the procedures outlined in Chapter 4, all 
analyses are based on item-pairs. The reader is encouraged to refer to 
Chapter 4 for a review of other details regarding a description of the 
SDQIII, the hypothesized model, and procedures for establishing a base-
line model for each group. 
1. Tests for Invariance Related to the SDQIII 
1.1. The Hypothesized Model 
As in Chapter 4, all analyses were based on item-pairs, rather than on 
single items. Likewise, the CFA model under study hypothesized a priori 
that: responses to the SDQIII could be explained by four factors (general 
SC, academic SC, English SC, and mathematics SC), each item-pair 
would have a nonzero loading on the SC factor it was designed to measure 

I. Tests for Invariance Related to the SDQIII

(i.e., the target factor) and zero loadings on all other factors (i.e., nontar-
get factors), the four factors would be correlated, and the uniquenesses 
for the item-pair variables would be uncorrelated. This model was pre-
sented schematically in Figure 4.1, and the pattern of parameters to be 
estimated was detailed in Table 4.1. 
1.2. The Baseline Models 
Although for both tracks the hypothesized four-factor model represented 
a psychometrically reasonable fit to the data (low track, lldf = 2.32, 
BBI = 0.90; high track, lldf = 4.40, BBI = 0.91), the fit, based solely 
on statistical criteria, was less than adequate (low track, X~183) = 425.18, 
p<O.OOI; high track X~183) = 805.45, p<O.OO1). 
To investigate the misfit in the model, a sensitivity analysis was con-
ducted as outlined in Chapter 4. As such, model fitting for each track was 
continued beyond the initially fitted models. Several additional modifica-
tions that included both correlated uniquenesses and secondary loadings 
(item-pair loadings on nontarget factors), resulted in a statistically better 
fitting model for both the low track X~I64) = 192.48, P = 0.06; BBI = 0.94) 
and the high track (X~149) = 171.52,p = 0.10; BBI = 0.98). Given the 
probability of method effects (see Byrne, 1988b; Gerbing & Anderson, 
1984) and the moderate correlations among the four SC factors under 
study, these parameters were not unexpected. 
Based on the following considerations, however, these final models 
were rejected in favor of the more parsimonious initial models: the 
uniqueness covariance estimates, while statistically significant, were rela-
tively minor (low track X = 0.05; high track, X = 0.04); the estimated 
secondary factor loadings, while statistically significant, were also rela-
tively minor (low track, X = 0.04; high track, X = 0.03); the estimated 
factor loading and factor variance-covariance estimates in the final model 
correlated 0.93 and 0.99, respectively, for the low track, and 0.94 and 
0.97, respectively, for the high track, with those in the initially hypothe-
sized model (see Byrne et aI., 1989; Tanaka & Huba, 1984), these results 
substantiating the stability of the initial models; although each of the 
model respecifications yielded a statistically significant improvement in 
model fit, these increments based on the BBI could be considered of little 
practical importance (see also, Marsh & Hocevar, 1985); the sensitivity 
of the llikelihood ratio test with large samples is now widely known (see 
Bentler & Bonett, 1980; Marsh & Hocevar, 1985); and given the explor-
atory nature of these supplementary analyses, and thus the risk of capital-
ization on chance factors (see MacCallum, 1986), the final model esti-
mates were considered dubious. For these reasons, then, the initial model 
for each track was used as the baseline model in tests of invariance; these 
models are presented schematically in Figure 7.1.

2. Tests for Invariance Across Ability 
2.1. Testing for Equivalent Item-Pair Measurements 
Given Muthen's comments regarding the omnibus test of invariant vari-
ance-covariance matrices (see Chapter 6), we begin by first testing for an 
invariant number off actors across track. As such, the high- and low-track 
baseline models were combined into one file and the model specified as 
a two-group four-factor model. The fit of this four-factor solution, which 
we will call Modell, yielded a reasonable fit to the data (X~366) = 1230.64; 
BBI = 0.90).' On the basis of these results, we conclude that for both 
tracks the data are adequately described by the four hypothesized factors 
of SC. The LISREL input for this simultaneous run (Model 1), is pre-
sented in Table 7.1. The presentation of specification data for Model 1 in 
two different formats is intended to assist you in making the correspon-
dence between the model schema as presented in Figure 7.1 and the com-
puter input as presented in Table 7.1. 
A couple of points related to the Model 1 input are worthy of note. 
First, the theta-delta matrix could also have been specified as TD = DI. 
As such, there would be no need to specify all 68 parameters as free; 
start values, however, would be specified for each of these parameters. 
Second, you will note that, unlike the application presented in Chapter 6, 
the start values here remained unchanged from the single-group analyses 
based on the correlation matrix (KM) and the mUltiple-group analyses 
based on the covariance matrix (CM). The reason for leaving the start 
'Recall that this goodness-of-fit index represents the sum of the l values for the 
separately estimated baseline models.

7. Testing for Item Invariance of a Measuring Instrument 
values intact here was because a convergent solution was achieved with 
the original values. 2 
As noted in Chapter 6, evidence that the data are well described by 
four SC factors for both the low and the high tracks (see Model 1) in no 
way implies that the actual factor loadings are the same across track; this 
hypothesis must be tested and is done so by placing equality constraints 
on all parameters. The LISREL input for this model (Model 2), as speci-
fied for the high track (group 2) only, is illustrated in Table 7.2.3 Of partic-
ular importance in the MO statement is the specification that the A matrix 
be constained invariant across groups (LX = IN). It is worth noting that 
although the specification of A parameters as free or fixed has been de-
leted from the input, as have the start values for these parameters, this 
need not have been done. Had these specifications been included, how-
ever, the imposition of a constrained A matrix would have caused LIS-
REL to override these commands. 
The hypothesis of an invariant pattern of factor loadings across track 
was found to be tenable (al (17) = 23.91); the al representing the dif-
ference in model fit between Model 1 (number of factors constrained 
equal) and Model 2 (number of factors and pattern of factor loadings con-
strained equal). From this information we can conclude that all items 
comprising the four subscales of the SDQ are measuring the same SC 
facet in the same scaling units for both the low and high tracks. 
It is important to note that if, on the other hand, the hypothesis of an 
equivalent pattern of factor loadings had been rejected, we would want 
to investigate further, the source of this noninvariance. Therefore, we 
would proceed to test, independently, each item-pair factor-loading pa-
rameter in the matrix. (This technique will be demonstrated in Chapter 
8.) 
2.2. Testing for Equivalent Factor Covariances 
Testing for the invariance offactor covariances bears on the group equiv-
alence of SC relations as measured by the four SDQIII subscales. To test 
this hypothesis, equality constraints are imposed, independently, on each 
2 A nonconvergent solution is evidenced by the error message that LX is written 
on-----KSI 2 (or something comparable). Like many other error messages 
in LISREL, this one bears no clue to the problem of inappropriate start values. 
Should you receive this message, however, the start values should be made larger, 
consistent with covariance, rather than correlation values (see Chapter 6). 
3Since in testing for invariance using LISREL, the model of interest is specified 
such that constraints on the model (i.e., specification of equalities across groups) 
are specified on the MO card for the second and subsequent groups only, the 
model specification for group 1 therefore remains intact and is never altered. 
Thus, the LISREL input related to the MO and subsequent cards for group 2 only 
is of interest for all remaining tests for invariance.

of these phi parameters (<1>21' <1>31' <1>41' <1>32' <1>42' <1>43)' However, recall that 
tests for invariance are based on a series of successively specified mod-
els, such that each is more restrictive than the former; such models are 
referred to as "nested models." In keeping with this model-nesting mode 
then, we now increase the number of restrictions in Model 2 by adding 
equality constraints for each of these covariance parameters. This is ac-
complished by placing equality constraints on both the LX matrix and the 
particular parameters representing covariances; we'll call this Model 3. 
The LISREL specification input for this model (again for the high track 
only) is presented in Table 7.3. Note that since the entire <I> matrix was 
not constrained equal across groups (which would need to be indicated 
on the MO card), a separate equality constraint statement must be speci-
fied for each parameter of interest.

nificant (Ai (6) = 6.42), the hypothesis of invariant factor covariances 
is considered tenable. This finding provides evidence that the theoretical 
structure of SC, as measured by the SDQIII, is the same for both the low 
and high tracks. (Compare these results with those across gender using 
multiple measures of SC, as demonstrated in Chapter 6.) 
Once again, if the hypothesis of equivalent factor covariances had been 
found untenable, we would be well advised to investigate further, the 
source of this noninvariance by testing, independently, each factor covar-
iance parameter in the cP matrix; model specification, of course, would 
include the invariant or partially invariant A parameters. 

2. Tests for Invariance Across Ability 
151 
2.3. Testing for Equivalent Item-Pair Reliabilities 
Generally speaking, in multiple-indicator CFA models, testing for the in-
variance of reliability is neither necessary (J6reskog, 1971a), nor of par-
ticular interest when the scales are used merely as CF A indicators and 
not as measures in their own right, ignoring reliability (Muthen, personal 
communication, Oct. 1987). Although J6reskog (1971b) demonstrated the 
steps involved in testing for a completely invariant model (i.e., invariant 
A, <1>, and 8), this procedure is considered an excessively stringent test 
of factorial invariance (Muthen, personal communication, Jan. 1987). In 
fact, J6reskog (1971a) has shown that while it is necessary that multiple 
measures of a latent construct be congeneric (i.e., believed to measure 
the same construct), they need not exhibit invariant variances and error/ 
uniquenesses. 
When the mUltiple indicators of a CF A model represent items from a 
single measuring instrument, however, it may be of interest to test for the 
invariance of item reliabilities as a means to detect evidence of item bias 
(see e.g., Benson, 1987). In contrast to the conceptual definition of item 
bias generally associated with cognitive instruments (i.e., individuals of 
equal ability have unequal probability of success), item bias related to 
affective instruments reflects on its validity, and hence, on the question 
of whether items generate the same meaning across groups; evidence of 
such item bias is a clear indication that the scores are differentially valid 
(Green, 1975). 
From classical test theory, item reliability is defined as the ratio of true 
score variance to total score variance (true plus error score variance); in 
LISREL lexicon this can be represented as <p/(<p + 80), where <p repre-
sents factor true score variance and 80 represents error score variance 
associated with measures of the factor. For example, in the present study, 
<PI/(<PII + 8011 ) represents the ratio of true score to total score variance 
for general SC. (Total score variance = true score variance plus error 
score variance associated with the six item-pair measurements of general 
SC.) It follows from this that the reliability of each measure in a LISREL 
model is determined in part by the variance of its corresponding factor; 
the reliability ratio thus becomes ,,?<p/(A2<p + 80) (J6reskog, 1971b). Again, 
within the framework of the present data, A;I<PII/(A;I<PII + 8033) would 
represent the reliability of the third item-pair designed to measure general 
SC. 
In examining test reliability, it is important to know if the factor vari-
ances are equivalent across groups. If they are, then the invariance of 
item reliabilities is tested by constraining related AS, os, and <ps across 
groups (see e.g., Cole & Maxwell, 1985; Rock et aI., 1978). If, on the 
other hand, the factor variances are nonequivalent across groups, then 
testing for reliability invariance must be based on the ratio of true and

error score variances (Cole & Maxwell, 1985; Rock et aI., 1978). This 
procedure, however, is quite complex and has not been fully demon-
strated in the literature. Although Werts et ai. (1976) address the testing 
of a ratio of variances, they do not provide an explicit application related 
to tests for the in variance of the reliability ratio. 
Returning once again to our track data, our first step is to test for the 
invariance of factor variances in order to establish the viability of impos-
ing equality constraints on the X. and 1) for each item-pair. The LISREL 
input for this model (Model 4), as specified for the high track, is presented 
in Table 7.4.4 
4Although this model was specified by adding separate equality constraint state-
ments for each of the variance parameters PH(1, 1), PH(2,2), PH(3,3), and 
PH(4,4), we could just as easily have specified the entire cP matrix invariant 
(PH=IN) on the MO card.

The difference in model fit between Models 3 and 4 was found to be 
highly significant (Lll (4) = 27.61, p<O.OOl); the hypothesis of equivalent 
factor variances must therefore be rejected. Given these findings, we now 
want to determine which of the four variances are noninvariant in order 
that we know how to proceed in testing for the invariance of item-pair 
reliabilities. Thus, we proceed to test for the equality of each variance 
parameter, independently, using the same procedure as that demon-
strated in Chapter 6. As such, Model 3 (in which all factor loadings and 
covariances are constrained equal) is estimated with the additional speci-
fication that the variance of general SC (<1>11) be constrained equal across 
track; likewise, each of the remaining variances for academic (<1>22)' En-
glish (<1>33)' and mathematics (<1>44) SCs is specified, respectively, and the 
model subsequently estimated. For example, the LISREL input for the 
first of these four models tests for the equality of general SC variance; 
the specification is as specified in Table 7.3, but with the added statem-
ent-EQ PH(1,I,l) PH(1,!). 
Results of these tests were derived from the comparison of each of 
these models with Model 3, in which only the factor loadings and covari-
ances were constrained. Findings revealed only one factor variance (<1>33' 
English SC) to be invariant across track (LlXZl) = 0.08). Results for the 
three noninvariant variances are as follows: general SC (LlX~l) = 4.05, 
p<0.05); academic SC (LlX~l) = 13.13, p<O.OOI); and mathematics SC (Ll 
X~I) = 14.79, p<O.OOl). These results are summarized in Table 7.5. 
For purposes of the present study, further tests of invariance are con-
ducted for the English SC factor only. Our first concern, then, is to deter-
mine if all item-pairs comprising this subscale are invariant across track. 
We begin by testing a model in which all the factor loadings and covari-

ances are constrained equal across groups (Model 3), but with the added 
constraint that the error variance for each item-pair measuring English 
SC (812,12,813,13,814,14,815,15,816,16) is also held invariant; Model 3 serves as 
the base model against which all competing models related to the reliabil-
ity of English SC measures are compared. The additional LISREL input 
for testing the entire subscale would therefore specify the following: 
EQ TD(1,12,12) TD(12,12). 
ED TD(1,13,13) TD(13,13). 
ED TD(1 ,14,14) TD(14,14). 
ED TD(1,15,15) TD(15,15). 
ED TD(1,16,16) TD(16,16), 
Results from these tests are summarized in Table 7.6. As shown here, 
the test of equal reliability of all English SC measures in combination 
demonstrated a significant 6..l (p<O.OOl) indicating that the reliability of 
at least one item-pair was noninvariant across track. Given these findings, 
as illustrated in Chapter 6, each item-pair measurement was subsequently 
tested independently in order to detect the noninvariant measures; item-
pairs 15 and 16 were found to be noninvariant across track. 
3. Summary 
This chapter examined tests for the invariance of a single measuring in-
strument across levels of academic ability. Specifically, hypotheses were

tested that related to the equivalence of the SDQIII subscale item mea-
surements, theoretical relations among the four facets of SC (general, ac-
ademic, English, and mathematics), and reliabilities of the item-pairs re-
lated to each subscale. Tests for invariance were conducted at both the 
matrix and individual parameter levels.

Testing for Invariant Latent Mean 
Structures 
The primary purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate procedures for test-
ing the invariance of latent mean structures, or, stated differently, testing 
for differences in latent means. The analytic strategy here differs both 
conceptually and technically from the two previous applications related 
to invariance. A secondary aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the tech-
nique of testing for and with partial measurement invariance; thus far, we 
have not had occasion to apply this important procedure. (For details of 
the study related to this application, see Byrne, 1988a.) 
Let us first review the basic conceptual and technical differences in 
tests of invariance related to the current and former applications. In 
Chapters 6 and 7 our analyses involved testing for the invariance off actor 
measurement and variance-covariance parameters; as such, only the 
analysis of covariance structures was of interest. This is because in such 
analyses, modeling with the mean-related parameters does not impose 
restrictions on the observed variable means. In testing for the invariance 
offactor means, on the other hand, the modeling does involve restrictions 
on the observed variable means and, therefore, the analysis is based on 
both the covariance and mean structures. Thus, in addition to the factor 
measurement (A, 8) and factor variance-covariance matrices (<1», the re-
gression intercept (nu, v) and mean (gamma, f) vectors are of primary 
interest. More specifically, v is a vector of constant intercept terms and 
considered to be a component of the LISREL measurement model; r is 
a vector of mean estimates and a component of the LISREL structural 
model. 
Technically, testing for the invariance of mean structures is more com-
plicated and thus more tedious than testing for the invariance of covari-
ance structures. (The paucity of reported research in which the technique 
has been applied would seem to attest to this fact; for a review, see Byrne 
et aI., in press.) For example, in order to test for the invariance of latent 
means, the model must be structured as an all-Y specification. This 
means that ifthe researcher has used an all-X model in preceding analyses 
(as we have done thus far in this book), a reformulation of model specifi-
156

cations is a necessary prerequisite to further analyses involving mean 
structures. The primary aim of the present chapter is to outline, in some 
detail, the steps involved in transforming an all-X to an all-Y model in 
order to test for latent mean differences (i.e., the invariance of latent 
mean structures). 
1. Tests for Invariance Related to Latent 
Self-Concept Means 
1.1. The Hypothesized Model 
The postulated model in the present application is identical to the one 
proposed in Chapter 6 (see Figure 6.1), with one exception-the present 
model hypothesizes that SC measurements and structure are factorially 
invariant across low- and high-academic tracks (rather than across 
gender). 
1.2. The Baseline Models 
For both the low- and high-track groups, the baseline model was derived 
from the process of post hoc model fitting with concomitant sensitivity 
analyses. These investigations led to final models that included one sec-
ondary loading (low track = x'71; high track = x'61)' and four error covari-
ances between subscales of the same measuring instrument, three of 
which were common across track. (For a more extensive discussion of 
analyses related to the fitting of these models, see Byrne et al., 1989.) A 
summary of model specifications related to fitting the baseline models for 
low and high track is presented in Table 8.1; the models are illustrated 
schematically in Figure 8.1. 
2. Testing for the Invariance of Factor Covariance 
Structures 
As with previous tests for invariance demonstrated in Chapters 6 and 7, 
the simultaneous estimation of parameters for both tracks was based on 
covariance, rather than on correlation matrices. One marked difference 
between this application and those presented earlier is that the baseline 
model, for both the low and high-tracks, includes one secondary loading' 
that is dissimilar across track. Thus, it is important to note that these 
'Secondary loadings are measurement loadings on more than one factor; they are 
also referred to as cross-loadings.

covariance explained by the hypothesized model; a value <0.90 usually means 
that the model can be improved substantially.

gesting that, for both tracks, the data were well described by four SC 
factors-general SC, academic SC, English SC, and mathematics SC. 
Invariant Pattern of Factors Loadings. The hypothesis of an invariant 
pattern of factor loadings was tested next by constraining all lambda pa-
rameters (except )1.71 and )1.61) to be equal, and then comparing this model 
(Model 2) with Model 1, in which the number of factors and pattern of 
loadings were held invariant across track, but not constrained equal. 
Given the two different cross-loadings (i.e., secondary loadings) for each 
track, the entire A matrix could not be constrained equal on the MO card 
using the specification LX = IN. Rather, a separate statement of equality 
had to be specified for each )I. parameter. This LISREL specification in-
put for the low track only (as Group 2) is presented in Table 8.3.

8. Testing for Invariant Latent Mean Structures 
The estimation of this model yielded a l differential that was highly 
significant (dX~7) = 25.82, p < 0.001), indicating that the hypothesis of an 
invariant pattern of factor loadings must be rejected. Confronted with this 
finding, it is now of interest to pinpoint differences in the measurement 
parameters between low and high tracks. As such, we test for partial mea-
surement invariance by testing, independently, the equivalence of each 
congeneric set of lambda parameters specified to measure each SC facet. 
2.2. Testing for Partial Measurement Invariance 
We begin by examining the measurement of general SC, by holding h21 
and/~31 invariant across track. This hypothesized model is found to be 
tenable (dX2 (2) = 0.16). Thus, we next test the equality of measurements 
for academic SC by holding h21' h31' and hS2 invariant; this hypothesized 
model could also not be rejected (dl (3) = 7.41). Continuing in this man-
ner, we test the invariance of factor measurements for both the English 
and mathematics SC factors; both hypothesized models were rejected 
(English SC, dl (5) = 17.01, p<O.OI; mathematics SC, dl (5) = 16.59, 
p<O.01). Before proceeding further with these tests of partial measure-
ment invariance, it seems prudent to stop and allow the reader to review 
the LISREL specification input for each of these tests. This information 
is presented in Table 8.4. In examining these model specifications, it is 
important to note the cumulative pattern of adding invariant parameters 
to each successive model to be estimated. 
As we noted earlier the combination of instruments measuring English 
and mathematics SCs was found to be noninvariant across track. Now 
we want to determine if anyone of these measures is actually invariant 
across track. Thus, we proceed to test for the equality of each of these 
lambda parameters, individually, while concomitantly holding h21' h31' 
and hS2 invariant. You can study these model specifications in Table 8.5. 
These results revealed that English SC as measured by the SCA (hS3)' 
and mathematics SC as measured by the API (h lO•4), were inconsistent 
across track. In other words, the SCA and API were not measuring En-
glish SC and mathematics SC, respectively, in the same way for students 
in both academic tracks. A summary of findings related to tests for the 
equality of the SC measuring instruments across track is detailed in Table 
8.6. 
Admittedly, the sequential testing of models in the exploration of par-
tial measurement invariance is problematic. Given the nonindependence 
of the tests, it is possible that an alternative series of tests might lead to 
quite different results. While we might believe that our sequential model-
fitting procedures are substantively reasonable, verification must come 
from cross-validated studies.

2.3. Testing for the Invariance of Structural Parameters 
Having determined equalities among the measurement parameters, our 
interest now focuses on testing for the equality of the structural parame-
ters; we turn, then, to the matrix offactor variances and covariances (<1». 
Our first step in testing for the equality of SC structure, is to constrain 
the entire factor variance-covariance matrix invariant across track. The 
LISREL specification input for this model is shown in Table 8.7. Note 
that in conducting tests for the invariance of structure it is important to 
maintain constraints on the measurement parameters; only those mea-
sures known to be consistent in their measurements across track, how-
ever, are held invariant. 
The hypothesis of an invariant factor variance-covariance matrix was 
found untenable (LlX~IO) = 47.91, p < 0.001). Thus, we employ the same 
strategy as when confronted with a noninvariant A matrix; we proceed to 
test, independently, the equivalence of each parameter in the <I> matrix; 
recall again that, at all times, only those measures known to be consistent 
in their measurements across track are held invariant (i.e., A21 , A31, AS2' 
A73, AtI •4). As with our tests of measurement parameters, the LISREL 
input changes from a specification on the MO card (PH = IN) to a specifi-
cation of equality constraints for each individual structural parameter; 
each one being specified, one at a time. Since this technique was specified 
for the individual A parameters, it need not be detailed again here. 
The results of these analyses yielded one variance (<1>44) and two covari-
ance (<1>31' <1>42) parameters to be noninvariant across track. A summary of 
findings from tests for an invariant SC structure (i.e., SC variances and 
covariances) is presented in Table 8.8.

3, Testing for the Invariance of Factor Mean Structures 
3.1. LISREL Input 
Using LISREL to test for the invariance of mean structures requires that 
we make several adjustments to the baseline model specification input as 
presented in Table 8.2. To enable you to follow this model transforma-
tion, the specified pattern of parameters, for both the low and high tracks, 
is presented in Table 8.9 for the all-X model, and in Table 8.10 for the all-
y model. Note the addition of a vector of intercepts (vs) and a vector of 
latent mean parameters (-ys). Before proceeding further, you are urged to 
go back and compare the LISREL input for the two baseline models (see 
Table 8.2) and the pattern of parameters for these same models (see Table 
8.9). 
As noted earlier, our first step in testing for latent mean differences was 
to restructure the baseline models into an all-Y specification. As such, the 
factor loading (Ax), factor variance-covariance (<I» and error variance-
covariance (88) matrices (see Table 8.9) were converted into the Ay , '1', 
and 8. matrices, respectively; the i;s (the latent factors) were treated as 
1}S in the LISREL sense (see Table 8.10). Second, the program must be 
"tricked" into estimating the latent means. This is done by creating a 
dummy variable (i.e., an extra variable, 'dummy,' was added to the vari-
able list, making a total of 12 input variables, not 11). The dummy variable 
was given a fixed-Y specification equal to 1.00 (i.e., its value was con-
strained equal to a value of 1.00). Third, to accommodate the dummy

variable, a row of Os (one for each variable was added to the last row of 
the input matrix which, in the case of the present data, is a correlation 
matrix (see Table 8.1); the value of 1.00 was added to the series of stan-
dard deviations (i.e., the standard deviation value representing the 
dummy variable). Fourth, since the analysis of structured means must be 
based on the moment, rather than on the covariance matrix, the observed 
mean values were added to the data input; a value of 1.00 was added for 
the dummy variable since its value was fixed. Fifth, the A and -qr matrices 
must be modified to accommodate the dummy variable; this was accom-
plished as follows: and extra column of free AS was added to the matrix; 
these represent the measurement intercepts and an extra row of Os was 
added to the -qr matrix; ~55 was fixed to zero.4 Sixth, the latent mean val-
ues were estimated in the gamma (n matrix. The parameters I'll to 1'41 
were fixed to zero for the low track, but allowed to be freely estimated 
for the high track; 1'51 was fixed to 1.0 for both tracks. Finally, since the 
analysis of mean structures is based on the moment matrix, the DA card 
was modified to read as MA = MM. 
The LISREL specification input for both the low and high tracks is 
presented in Table 8.11. To get a clear picture of this transformation from 
the all-X to the all-Y model, I urge you to study and compare carefully 
the pattern of parameters presented in Tables 8.9 (all-X model) and 8.10 
(all-Y model), and the LISREL specification input in Tables 8.2 (all-X 
model) and 8.11 (all-Y model). 
Since the origins of the measurements and the means of the latent vari-
ables cannot be identified simultaneously, absolute mean estimates are 
not possible. However, when the parameter specifications as described 
earlier are imposed, latent mean differences between groups can be esti-
mated; one group is used as the reference group and as such, its latent 
mean parameters are fixed to 0.0. In this case, the low track served as 
the reference group; mean parameters for the high track were freely esti-
mated. Comparison of the groups, then, is based on the difference from 
zero. Statistical significance is determined from the T-values (mean esti-
mates divided by their standard error estimates). 
Once again, I want to draw your attention to the fact that only the 
factor-loading parameters known to be consistent in their SC measure-
ments across track were held invariant. Thus, it is important to note that 
since A71 and A61 were freely estimated for the low and high track, respec-
tively, the intercept terms for these parameters (A7S ' A65) were also free 
to vary for each track. 
4The LISREL program will print the message that "PSI is not positive definite." 
This can be ignored since it is a function of ~5S being fixed to 0.0.

3.2. LISREL Output 
The parameter estimates and standard errors are shown in Table 8.12. At 
first glance, the format used in presenting the results may seem somewhat 
confusing to you; your reaction is not unexpected. Admittedly, the pre-
sentation of these data, although conventional, certainly bears further ex-
planation. Let's now examine important elements in the table. 
1. All values in parentheses, as footnoted in Table 8.12, represent the 
standard errors of the estimates. 
2. All estimates appearing in the center column represent parameters 
that were held invariant across track; the values presented are therefore 
common to both tracks. All other values relate to parameters that were 
freely estimated for each group.5 In this regard, let us now look more 
closely at particular measurement parameters that were specified as non-
invariant across track. These include: 
SExcept for parameters "111-"141 for the low track; these values were fixed to 0.0.

8. Testing for Invariant Latent Mean Structures 
(a)V6(~65) and vi~75)-the intercept terms for the two cross-loadings (~61; 
~71)' 
(b)~83 and ~1O'4-the measures of English SC (SCAESC) and mathematics 
SC (APIMSC). 
(C)~61 and ~71-the cross-loading of two English SC subscales onto the 
general SC factor for the high track (~61; SDQESC) and for the low 
track (~71; APIESC), respectively. Thus, only one parameter for each 
group is estimated. 
(d)e~96 and e~1l.8-error covariances specific to the high track (SDQMSCI 
SDQESC) and low track (SCAMSC/SCAESC), respectively.6 
(e)e~ll-e~ll.ll-error variances specific to each track. 
3. In examining the latent mean parameters (I'll to 1'41)' we see that 
estimates are presented only for the high track; recall that these parame-
ters were specified as fixed to 0.0 for the low track. For interpretative 
purposes, the following points are worthy of note: 
(a) The fact that the I' estimates for the high track are positive values 
indicates that scores for all SC factors were higher for the high track 
than for the low track. 
(b) The largest differences between tracks are shown to be in academic 
SC (1'21), followed by mathematics SC (1'41) and English SC (1'31), re-
spectively; mean track differences in general SC (I'll) were negligible. 
(c) To determine if the differences in latent SC means are statistically 
significant, we examine the T-values presented in the output. Since 
the parameters for the low track are fixed to 0.0, the T-values for the 
high track indicate whether the estimates are significantly different 
from zero; values >2.00 are considered statistically significant. As 
such, significant mean track differences were found with respect to 
academic SC (T = 13.99), English SC (T = 7.58), and mathematics 
SC (T = 6.93); differences in general SC were not significant (T = 
0.23). 
Overall, the results demonstrate that the test for invariant SCs across 
track based on mean and covariance structures was statistically more 
powerful than tests based on covariance structures alone. Whereas tests 
of in variance based on the latter found academic track differences in 
mathematics SC (<1>44) only, this was not so in the analysis that also in-
cluded mean structures; significant differences were also found in aca-
demic and English SCs. 
6Note that while the error covariances 6.85 , 6.10•7 , and 6.11 ,5 were common to each 
track, they were not constrained equal across groups.

4. Summary 
This chapter demonstrated applications of two unique concepts associ-
ated with tests for invariance: testing for and with partial measurement 
invariance and testing for differences in latent mean structures. Since the 
LISREL approach to testing for mean structures requires total reparame-
terization if the analysis of covariance structures was based on an all-X 
model, the transposition of parameters from an all-X to an all-Y specifica-
tion was detailed. Relatedly, the creation and specification of the dummy 
variable in LISREL analyses of mean structures was explained and dem-
onstrated. Finally, results were interpreted within the tabular framework 
typically used in reporting findings from the analysis of mean structures.

Appendix: Description of Data and 
Measuring Instruments 
Sample and Procedure 
The original sample comprised 996 grade 11 and 12 students from two 
suburban high schools in Ottawa, Canada. The data approximated a nor-
mal distribution with skewness ranging from -1.27 to 0.06 (X = -0.32); 
kurtosis ranged from -0.86 to 2.30 (X = 0.12). 
A battery of SC instruments (described later) was administered to in-
tact classroom groups during one 50- minute period. To ensure the rele-
vancy of self-concept (SC) responses related to English and mathematics, 
it was important that all students in the sample be enrolled in both of 
these subject areas. Since English is part of the core curriculum for high 
schools in Ontario (i.e., compulsory), it was known that all students were 
enrolled in at least one English course; therefore, only mathematics 
classes were tested for the study. The testing was completed approxi-
mately two weeks following the April report cards. The students there-
fore had the opportunity of being fully cognizant of their academic perfor-
mance prior to completing the tests for the study. This factor was 
considered important in the measurement of academic and subject-spe-
cific SCs. 
Instrumentation 
The SC test battery consisted of 12 measures-3 each for general SC, 
academic SC, English SC, and mathematics SC. All were self-report rat-
ing scales designed for use with a high school population. General SC was 
measured using the General-self Subscale of the Self Description Ques-
tionnaire (SDQIII) (Marsh & O'Neill, 1984), the Self-concept subscale of 
the Affective Perception Inventory (API) (Soares & Soares, 1979), and 
the Self-esteem Scale (SES) (Rosenberg, 1965). Measures of academic 
SC were the SDQIII Academic Self-concept scale, the API Student Self 
subscale, and the Self-concept of Ability Scale form A (SCA) (Brookover, 

182 
Appendix A: Description of Data and Measuring Instruments 
1962). English SC was measured with the SDQIII Verbal Self-concept 
subscale, the API English Perceptions sub scale, and the SCA form B. 
Items on form B are identical to those on form A, except that they elicit 
responses relative to specific academic content (e.g., "How do you rate 
you ability in English compared to your close friends'?"). Finally, mea-
sures of mathematics SC included the SDQIII Mathematics SC subscale, 
the API Mathematics Perceptions subscale, and the SCA form C (items 
specific to mathematics ability). The instruments were selected because 
they purported to measure (with some empirical justification) the SC fac-
ets in the theory to be tested. 
The SDQIII is structured on an eight-point Likert-type scale with re-
sponses ranging form "I-Definitely False" to "8-Definitely True." 
The general-self sub scale contains 12 items and the other three subscales, 
10 items each. Internal consistency reliability coefficients ranging from 
0.86 to 0.93 (Md a = 0.90) for the SDQIII general SC and each of the 
academic SC subscales, and strong support for their construct validity 
based on interpretations consistent with the Shavelson et al. (1976) model 
of SC have been reported (Byrne & Shavelson, 1986; Marsh & O'Neill, 
1984). These four subscales have also been shown to be invariant across 
sex and ability (Byrne, 1988b, 1988c). 
The API was developed as a semantic differential with a forced-choice 
format containing four categories spread along a continuum between two 
dichotomous terms (e.g., "happy," "unhappy"). Internal consistency 
coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.95 (Md a = 0.85) have been reported 
for the subscale measures of general SC, academic SC, and the subject-
specific SCs (Byrne & Shavelson, 1986; Soares & Soares, 1980). Conver-
gent validity coefficients ranged from 0.49 to 0.55 (Md r = 0.50) with peer 
ratings, and from 0.37 to 0.74 (Md r = 48.5) with teacher ratings for the 
same subscales. Soares and Soares (1980) also presented evidence of dis-
criminant validity. The number of items comprising each of the API sub-
scales is as follows: Self-concept-25; Student Self-25; English Percep-
tions-22; Mathematics Perceptions-17. 
The SES is a lO-item Guttman scale based on a format ranging from 
"strongly agree" to "strongly disagree." A test-retest reliability of 0.62 
(Byrne, 1983), and an internal consistency reliability coefficient of 0.87 
(Byrne & Shavelson, 1986) have been reported, as well as convergent 
validities ranging from 0.56 to 0.67 (see Byrne, 1983). The eight-item 
SCA, also a Guttman scale, is based on a five-point format. Respondents 
are asked to rank their ability in comparison with others on a scale from 
1 ("I am the poorest") to 5 ("I am the best"). Test-retest and internal 
consistency reliability coefficients ranging from 0.69 to 0.72, and from 
0.77 to 0.94, respectively, have been reported (see Byrne, 1983; Byrne & 
Shavelson, 1986).
