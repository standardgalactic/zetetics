In this case, motion is damped (with friction constant η), while energy approaches
its equilibrium value. Re-evaluations of the Ehrenfest theorem for open quantum
systems (often described by Lindblad equations derived from a Schr¨odinger equa-
tion that includes the environment (see  decoherence)) are important for a proper
understanding of the relation between classical and quantum physics.

In 1935 Albert Einstein, in collaboration with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen,
published a landmark paper entitled “Can quantum mechanical description of phys-
ical reality be considered complete?” [1] Einstein had already been engaged for
