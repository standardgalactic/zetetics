Welcome to Providence
Rhode Island’s Renaissance City
Welcome
It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Center for Resto-
rative and Regenerative Medicine for the 2010 ESM 
Conference.  The Center is a VA Center of Excellence and is 
comprised of researchers from the Providence VA Medi-
cal Center, Brown University and Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology.  It is an exciting time for our center as we 
continue to grow and add new research programs. We 
have recently moved to a new building which houses 
clinical and translational rehabilitation research programs 
and regenerative medicine laboratories all in one facility. 
This includes the Gait and Motion Analysis Laboratory, the 
Neurorehabilitation Lab and facilities for outcome studies.
The meeting that we have planned for you should be a par-
ticularly exciting one both scientifi cally and socially.  The 
scientifi c program will combine 39 oral presentations from 
over 60 submitted abstracts, a poster session, a workshop 
for novel users and two interesting keynote lectures.  
In addition to the outstanding scientifi c program, you will 
have the opportunity to explore the art and cultural diver-
sity of the city and beyond.  You will have the opportunity 
to attend WaterFire, a powerful work of art and a moving 
symbol of Providence’s renaissance and enjoy the confe-
rence venues chosen to highlight the ambiance of the city. 
The activity day on Block Island will reveal the beauty of an 
island, which off ers exploration, relaxation and adventure. 
On behalf of the Center of Restorative and Regenerative 
Medicine and Brown University, it gives me great pleasure 
to host this event.  Enjoy the meeting and your stay in 
Rhode Island!

The Center for Restorative and Regenerative Medicine is 
a collaboration between the Providence VA Medical Center 
and Brown University. The mission of the Center is to improve 
function for individuals with limb trauma by developing 
technologically advanced solutions for the restoration 
of limb function. To achieve this goal, the Center brings 
to bear state-of-the-art techniques in tissue engineering, 
orthopaedics, neurotechnology, prosthetic design, 
and rehabilitation. These are complementary techniques 
and they converge in the concept of the biohybrid limb – 
composed of both biological and non-biological materials – 
enabling us to envision solutions that transcend 
the limitations of biological tissue or prosthetic materials 
alone. Biohybrid structures are composed of both biological 
tissue and non-biological components. Examples in current 
clinical use are joint replacements, in which metal implants 
are integrated directly into bone. Biohybrid structures often 
have unique physical and physiological properties resulting 
from the integration of tissues and materials that require full 
understanding before they can be most eff ectively utilized 
in the clinical setting. Biohybrid limb research integrates 
independent developments in regenerative medicine, 
neurotechnology, prosthetics, and orthopedics to maximize 
limb function. 
The biohybrid limb is conceptualized as consisting 
of biological tissues and non-biological materials. 
Conceptualizing a limb as a biohybrid organ frees researchers 
and clinicians from constraints imposed by biological tissue 
and biomaterials, respectively.

2008 Meeting Review: Dundee, the City of Discovery
The 11th emed scientifi c meeting in 2008 was hosted by Professor 
Rami Abboud and his team at the Institute of Motion Analysis & Research 
(IMAR) at the University of Dundee in bony Scotland. The meeting was 
an excellent event shared by over 100 scientists who attended from 
17 diff erent countries to make the 11th user meeting a great success.
WRITTEN BY PROF. RAMI ABBOUD
On the 1st day, three workshops were delivered at IMAR for 
Novel users. The 1st two workshops highlighted the recent 
advances in the Novel arsenal of new technology and an up 
to date to the recent software development for the evaluation 
of pedographic data in clinical and scientifi c settings. The 
3rd workshop was an excellent display of the power of 
synchronisation of various systems with the Novel systems for 
clinical assessment, e.g. Vicon and Pedar. The day ended with 
a wine reception at the Bonar Hall at the University.
Science took centre stage on day 2 and 4 of the meeting with 30 
oral presentations, 20 posters and 4 keynote speakers displaying 
a diverse theme of Art in Science and creating a healthy debate. 
The oral presentation and poster Novel awards winners were 
Scott Wearing, UK (novel award 2008), Claudia Giacomozzi, Italy 
(poster award 2008) and Tobias Mayer, Germany (presentation 
award 2008).
Delegates were welcomed to the RRS Discovery ship after 
an intense scientifi c day only to be bombarded by another 
keynote lecture, but this time about the history of Dundee 
by one of the University most eminent historians, Professor 
Charles McKean. The lecture was followed by a Civic reception,  
co-sponsored by Dundee City Council and Dundee & Angus 
Convention Bureau, and tour of the ship. Unbelievably the 
weather was still good with hardly any rain!
Day 3, the most important day: the activity day! We were 
promised a miserable rainy Scottish day; Group 1 did not care 
as they were going to be inside Blair Castle and then sampling 
the Edradour whiskey. Group 2 did not care either as they chose 
Water sports; does it matter if water is above or under then! 
The day turned out to be one of the warmest and sunniest day 
in Scotland that was enjoyed by all and fi nished with a lovely 
dinner at the Cairngorm Mountain, albeit a bit of a delay to oil 
the trains!
After a hectic 4th day of scientifi c presentations and more 
debate, everybody looked tired and was looking for a relaxing 
dinner during the Novel award Ceremony. Relaxing dinner in 
Scotland...never. A Scottish-theme Tartan presentation and 
most importantly Ceilidh were on hand to make sure that 
everybody has the opportunity to never forget Scotland....
The team at IMAR worked closely with the team at Novel to 
organise what was perceived by many as one of the best ESM 
meeting in the hope that this tradition carries on with many 
years to come thanks to one man’s vision, Peter Seitz!

novel award
art in science award
Poster & Presentation awards
In 1991, the fi rst novel award was presented in recognition 
of excellence in pressure distribution research. The novel 
award recipient was determined by an international review 
committee from the fi elds of biomechanics and medicine. 
The novel award for pressure distribution measurement 
research continued since then to be endowed by novel and 
the best scientifi c manuscript in the fi eld of load distribution 
measurement will receive the 2010 art in science award with 
a prize of $5,000.00. The paper must be entirely original, 
not published at the time of the meeting in any journal 
nor submitted for publication to any journal or book. The 
paper must describe a scientifi c study including pressure 
distribution measurement.  Seven abstracts were nominated 
for the art in science award.
From 2010 on, the "novel award" will be named the 
"art in science award". In the future, the prize will be awarded 
also to scientists presenting papers not only associated with 
pedography or foot biomechanics, therefore the award going 
forward will be the "art in science award".
The nominated authors were requested to send a full length 
paper by the June 15, 2010 date and will present the paper 
at the meeting during a 25 minute talk. The review of the 
papers was conducted by the scientifi c review committee. 
The art in science award will be presented to the winner at 
the fi nal reception on Tuesday evening, August 17, 2010.
Presentation award
Will be presented during the fi nal reception on 
Tuesday August 17, 2010.
The award is based on voting of the scientifi c committee.
The award winner will receive a prize of $500.
Poster award
Will be presented during the fi nal reception on 
Tuesday August 17, 2010.
The award is based on voting of the scientifi c committee.
The award winner will receive a prize of $500.

Monday 
August 16, 2010
The traditional ESM Activity Day will be held on the beautiful 
Block Island www.blockislandinfo.com.  Transportation from the 
hotel to Block Island will be provided via a Ferry ride.  Once on 
Block Island guests may enjoy hiking, biking, kayaking, sailing, 
swimming and much more. After a full day of activities The 
Atlantic Inn will host an early evening New England Clam Bake. 
www.atlanticinn.com
Sailing – Ruling Passion 2.0 hours
A family run company that has shown off  spectacular Block 
Island sunsets for more than 10 years.  They sail their 45-foot 
trimaran from New Harbor three times a day.  The spacious, 
comfortable vessel is USCG certifi ed for 29 passengers.  Ruling 
passion is owned and operated by the Puckett family.  Fun 
outing for all ages. www.rulingpassion.com
Guided Hiking – Hodge Family Preserve 1.5 – 2.0 hours
At the north end of Corn Neck Road is this picturesque 25-acre 
fi eld sloping to Middle Pond and West Beach.  The property 
was acquired for conservation in 2002 and is jointly owned 
and managed by the town, The Nature Conservancy, the 
BI Land Trust and the Block Island Conservancy.  Walkers and 
others engaging in passive recreation are welcome.
Guided Hiking – Fresh Pond Greenway & Rodman’s Hollow – 
4.0 – 5.0 hours
This area is called “Smilin’ Thru” and reportedly inspired the 
1920s song composed by Arthur Penn, who stayed on the 
island.  Walkers should be prepared for steep slopes and some 
tricky footing.  The trails starts on Lakeside Drive near the 
intersection with Cooneymus Road, and heads west along 
the shore of Fresh Pond.  This trail links to Rodman’s Hollow.  
Rodman’s Hollow is a dramatic hollow that drops below sea 
level and features panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean as 
well as access to the beach.  Owned and protected by the 
Block Island Conservancy, Rodman’s Hollow is a memorable 
hike and the keystone to the island’s conservation eff orts. 
Guided Kayaking – 1.5 hours 
View wildlife and the scenic shoreline of the fascinating Great 
Salt Pond.  Suitable for beginners and experienced kayakers.
Guided Biking – 3.0 hours
All Block Island biking is on road. 
For those attendees choosing the shorter activities, biking, 
beach, and Old Harbor shopping will also be available.  
Destination information will be provided at the ESM 2010 
conference site.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Manifest hallux valgus deformity remains an 
abundant fore foot condition, whose entire or definite 
cause remains controversial. The extent of first ray 
instability and in particular of the first tarso-metatarsal 
(TMT-I) joint of the affected foot remains a key 
argument in the debate for optimal surgical treatment 
in 
hallux 
valgus 
conditions 
(Coughlin 
2003). 
Numerous attempts have been undertaken to more 
precisely investigate and quantify first ray instability. 
Klaue (1994) designed an apparatus to evaluate static 
TMT-I instability and combined a clinical study with a 
cadaver radiograph analysis for validation of the 
device. Glasoe et al. (2000) modified the Rodgers 
apparatus in order to respect dynamic stabilization 
aspects 
of 
the 
foot. 
Additionally 
in 
the 
pedobarographic foot print of hallux valgus patients a 
deformity related reduced weight bearing of the first 
ray has been described (Lorei, 2006). 
In 
our 
study, 
pedobarographic 
findings 
were 
correlated to the radiographically determined degree 
of first ray mobility of the foot. 
PATIENTS AND METHOD 
 
For our study 8 patients presenting a hallux 
valgus deformity on one foot or both feet, who were 
registered for corrective foot surgery out with our 
hospital, were enrolled. Seven were female one was 
male. Mean age was 44 (range 15-65). Clinical 
symptoms like foot pain, AAOF-Score and hallux 
valgus angle and intermetarsal angle were recorded. 
For simultaneous radiographic and pedobarographic 
measurement a mobile C-arm fluoroscope (ziehm, 
Nuremburg) 
and 
a 
plantar 
pedobarographic 
measurement platform (emed novel, Munich) were 
combined in an experimental setting to allow dynamic 
gait analysis in the entire stance phase of walking 
(including heel set down and fore foot take off). 
Pulsing radiograph recording (frequency 4 pulses/s) 
allowed digital analysis in selected frames and 
determination of motion among the joints of the first 
ray of the foot in particular the TMT-I joint (CAD 
program Solid Works, 2007). Simultaneously the 
pedobarographic footprint was recorded by the 
platform and peak pressure as well as maximum force 
were analyzed. Statistical analysis of hallux valgus 
radiological characteristics and pedographic findings 
of the first ray was by Pearson´s correlation. 
RESULTS
 
All enrolled patients presented a manifest hallux 
valgus deformity and met requirements for operative 
treatment by an experienced foot surgeon blinded to 
the study set up. The mean intermetatarsal angle was 
15°(range 8°-28°) and the mean hallux valgus angle 
was 45° (range 12°-80°). A large intermetatarsal angle 
correlated significantly with an increase of peak 
pressure under the first metatarsal (p=0,014). Further-
more the radiological computer-assisted determined 
maximal dorsiflexion of the first ray (from talus till 
metatarsal head) significantly correlated with the 
extent of the intermetatarsal angle (p=0,012). Mobility 
of the first tarso-metatarsal (TMT-I) joint however 
showed a significant correlation to an increase of 
maximum force of the mid-forefoot region.  
DISCUSSION 
       Mobility of the first metatarsal ray and in 
particular of the first tarso-metatarsal joint has been 
the subject of extensive research. Various devices had 
been developed to quantify first ray mobility of the 
foot. As in our study first ray deviation was mainly 
analyzed in the sagital plane. In our study we can 
support the notion of an enlarged intermetatarsal angle 
being associated with an increased dorsiflexion of the 
first ray of the foot during gait. Further more we found 
instability of the TMT-I –joint to have an increasing 
affect on mid-forefoot maximum force that may be 
relevant for pathological correlates.

INTRODUCTION 
 
While there are many clinical and case reported 
studies of hallux valgus (HV), the etiology and 
biomechanics of the pathology remain poorly 
understood. Although previous studies have noted 
differences in peak pressures in various regions of the 
foot between individuals with and without HV 
(Kernozek 2003, Yamamoto 1996, Yavuz 2009), 
results are inconsistent and have not been confirmed in 
larger studies. The purpose of this research is to 
describe peak plantar pressures and pressure-time 
integrals in an epidemiological population-based study 
and to investigate whether these measures differ 
between those with and without HV as defined by 
standardized foot examinations. We hypothesize that it 
is possible to distinguish individuals with and without 
HV based on differences in peak pressure and 
pressure-time integral measures. 
METHODS
 
Data were obtained from a subset of participants 
enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (N = 464; 
57% female; mean age, 65 years; mean BMI, 28).  
Between 2002 and 2005, plantar pressure values were 
collected using a Tekscan Matscan system (model 
3150, resolution of 1.4 sensels/cm2) while participants 
walked at a comfortable pace barefoot across the mat. 
Data was imported into Novel software and masked 
into 12 segments (toes, submetatarsal heads 1-5, 
medial arch and heel, lateral arch and heel). Peak 
pressure and pressure time integral values were then 
calculated. Two-tailed Students T-tests assessed 
differences between those with and without HV.

RESULTS
 
Preliminary analysis revealed significant sex 
differences in plantar pressures. Therefore, subsequent 
analyses were stratified by gender. Since the right foot 
is considered more dominant, only these results are 
reported. Tables 1 and 2 present a subset of the 12 
analyzed foot areas. Female subjects with HV 
exhibited greater peak pressure values under the 
lateral arch than those without HV (p = 0.046). No 
significant differences were found in pressure-time 
integrals for females with and without HV, regardless 
of foot area. Male subjects with HV exhibited greater 
peak pressure (p=0.007) and pressure-time integral 
(p=0.015) values than those without HV under 
groupings of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th toes. 
DISCUSSION 
 
Significant gender differences in peak pressures 
and pressure time integrals were noted. The data did 
not support our hypothesis as analyses did not 
distinguish between those with and without HV based 
on pressure-related measures. It is possible that the 
accuracy and resolution of Tekscan, in comparison to 
other foot mat systems, may have affected our results. 
It is also possible, since both groups contained 
concomitant pathologies, the plantar loading effects 
for HV washed out. Future work may investigate 
whether consideration of additional foot disorders or 
deformities may better use the plantar pressure 
measures to distinguish foot pathologies.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Several criteria determine the presence and 
severity 
of 
the 
bunion 
deformity 
(hallux 
abductovalgus; HAV), a common and disabling foot 
disorder.  Radiographic relationships in the weight-
bearing dorso-plantar view include the intermetatarsal 
angle, tibial sesamoid position, and hallux abductus 
angle (HAA).  The HAA determines the amount of 
hallux deviation in HAV.  While the radiographic 
technique is well accepted, it requires a small dose of 
radiation.  Evaluating foot structure without ionizing 
radiation may be clinically useful. 
  
The emed™ Geometry software (novel GmbH, 
Munich) calculates two hallux angles based on 
dynamic footprint:  HA1 based on the relationship of 
the medial hallux to the medial foot border and HA2 
relating the center of the Hallux to the estimated 
bisection of the angle between the first and second 
metatarsals, see Figure 1(left) and 1 (center). 
Alternatively, investigators wanted to examine the 
utility a graphical analog of HA1, constructed from a 
scan of the plantar weight bearing foot (MVIa), see 
Figure 1 (right).1 However, there has been no 
comparative study between radiographic versus the 
previously mentioned alternates. 
 
Investigators examined the utility of a using the 
angles form the Geometry software or a graphical 
analog of HA1 or HA2 based on a flatbed scan of the 
plantar weight bearing foot collected to determine the 
Malleolar Valgus Index (MVI)1.  When HAV is 
present, the Hallux Abductus angle is greater than 15 
degrees2.
METHODS
 
This is a retrospective study. Twenty eight (28) 
feet with clinical diagnosis of HAV and 10 feet 
without were included. Clinical assessment of HAV, 
radiological measure of HAA, MVI foot scans and 
EMED-X dynamic footprints were available for each 
subject.  Bivariate linear fit of HA1, HA2 and MVIa 
against HAA was evaluated using JMP 8 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC) 
RESULTS
 
Correlation coefficients and root mean square 
errors of HA1, HA2, and MVIa to corresponding 
HAA measurements were calculated (0.707 and 4.17, 
0.334 and 14.8, and 0.822 and 6.17, respectively (all 
p-values <0.01).  Descriptive statistics are shown in 
Table 1.  However, none of parameters was able to 
distinguish between those feet with HAV and those 
without when one way Analysis of Variance was 
performed .

CONCLUSIONS 
 
When a plantar weight-bearing scan of the foot is 
available, a reasonable estimate of the presence of 
bunion can be determined based on the relationship of 
the medial hallux to the medial foot border.  However, 
none of these variable by itself was able discern feet 
with HAV when evaluated via univariate analysis. 
Additional work is needed.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Data are available describing plantar loading 
planus and rectus foot types1, but little is available 
describing the loading of the healthy cavus foot.  The 
specific aim of this project was to compare plantar 
loading during gait for asymptomatic healthy 
individuals as a function of foot type (pes planus, 
rectus, and cavus). 
  
METHODS
 
We 
hypothesized
asymptomatic 
healthy 
individuals with pes planus, rectus, and pes cavus foot 
types will show differences in plantar loading. Sixty-
one subjects were stratified according to the resting 
calcaneal stance position and the forefoot to rearfoot 
relationship into pes planus, rectus, and cavus groups.  
Plantar pressures were recorded with an Emed-X 
system (Novel, Munich, Germany) while subjects 
walked barefoot at their self-selected comfortable 
speed. Five steps per side were analyzed with Novel 
masking software.  Peak pressure (PP), maximum 
force (MF), pressure-time integral (PTI), force-time 
integral (FTI), and contact area were calculated over 
ten masked regions.  Data were analyzed with a 
univariate 
mixed-effect 
analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA) model, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc t 
tests where significance was found.  Foot type and 
replication were modeled as fixed and random effects, 
respectively. ANOVA significance was set at p0.05; 
Bonferroni post-hoc significance was set at p0.017. 
 
RESULTS
 
Table 1 tabulates the results for PP and MF.  
Hallux PP and MF values were significantly higher for 
planus foot types.  PP and MF beneath the 1st 
metatarsal head (MTH1) in planus feet were 
significantly lower than both rectus and cavus feet.  
The 5th MTH PP and MF values were significantly 
higher for rectus and cavus as compared to planus feet.  
PP and MF was lowest under the lateral arch for cavus 
feet.  Cavus feet showed significantly higher PP at the 
lateral heel than rectus or planus.  MF beneath the 
medial heel was significantly different between rectus 
and cavus feet. The planus medial arch had twice the 
contact area of rectus, which had twice the area of 
cavus.   
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
In most plantar regions several measures of 
plantar loading were sensitive to foot type.  The lower 
1st MTH loads support the “hyper-mobile 1st-ray 
theory” where load is supported by the 2nd and 3rd 
MTH in many planus feet.  PTI and FTI corroborate 
this observation.  Higher 5th MTH cavus loads 
showed, as expected, differences to those of planus 
feet.  These data will serve as a reference for future 
investigations of pedal pathology as related to foot 
types, and for designing and evaluating treatments.

INTRODUCTION 
 
It has been suggested that foot structure may influence foot 
function (Song et al., 1996).  The aim of this study is to investigate 
the relationship between foot structure and function as a predictive 
tool that could be used to plan more effective conservative and 
surgical treatments of pedal pathologies. We hypothesize that 
measures of foot structure (hindfoot alignment and arch height) are 
associated with biomechanical measures of foot function in 
asymptomatic healthy individuals. 
METHODS
 
Foot structure was characterized by computing: (1) the maleolar 
valgus index (MVI) while standing, (2) arch height index (AHI) 
while sitting, and (3) AHI standing.  MVI is a measure of static 
hindfoot alignment (Song et al, 1996).  The subject’s plantar foot is 
scanned while standing on a plexiglass platform over a flatbed 
scanner with a custom-made jig to register the lateral and medial 
malleolus.  The deviation from the midpoint of the transmalleolar 
axis to the midpoint of the hindfoot, normalized to the foot width in 
this region, comprised the MVI.  Note that AHI is the arch height at 
one-half of foot length normalized by the truncated foot length 
(Zifchock et al, 2006). 
 
Foot function was characterized by calculating: (1) The center of 
pressure excursion index (CPEI - a measure of dynamic foot 
function), which is the lateral displacement of center of the pressure 
curve from the line constructed between the initial and the final 
center of pressure values, normalized by the foot width at the anterior 
one third of foot. (Song et al., 1996)  The emed X system (Novel 
gmbh, Germany) and custom software, developed in C++, were 
employed to calculate the CPEI.  Peak pressure (PP) and maximum 
force (MF) were calculated for the total plantar foot and each masked 
anatomical region using Novel software.   Temporal-distance foot-
fall parameters (e.g. step length, stride length, velocity, etc) were 
obtained with the GaitMatII (EQ systems, Glenside, PA).  Each of 61 
asymptomatic healthy adult test subjects walked at their comfortable 
self-selected speed across both the Emed-X and the GaitmatII 
systems to obtain the foot function data.  Each subject also was 
structurally evaluated with MVI and AHI (sitting and standing). 
RESULTS
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each combination 
of structural and functional parameter for the entire cohort. The 
results are summarized in Table 1.  MVI was significantly correlated 
with PP and MF at the hallux and negatively correlated with MF at 
the 1st MTPJ.  AHI standing was correlated with PP and MF at the 1st
MTPJ and negatively correlated with the PP at the 2nd MTPJ.  AHI 
sitting was correlated with double support time and velocity.   Step 
and stride lengths were negatively correlated with AHI 
sitting.  AHI sitting was correlated with MF at the 5th
MTPJ and negatively correlated with 2nd MTPJ PP and 
MF at the 1st MTPJ.   
DISCUSSION 
MVI was correlated with hallucial loading and 
negatively correlated with 1st MTPJ loading.  This 
finding is consistent with the overpronation that 
accompanies valgus hindfeet and a hypermobile first 
ray.  AHI was correlated with medial column loading 
as well as temporal-distance footfall parameters.  Foot 
structure is correlated with foot function and one’s 
basic gait pattern.

HUMAN WALKING: COMPARATIVE AND EVOLUTIONARY APPROACHES 
Human bipedal walking has a long 
and interesting evolutionary history.
Fossilized feet and footprints have 
played a prominent role in the 
interpretation of the nature of bipedalism 
in early hominins.  Recent discoveries of 
the fossil pedal remains of the Flores 
hominid (Figure 1), Ardipithecus, and 
ancient trackways have highlighted the 
diversity of early hominin bipeds and the 
mosaic of human and nonhuman skeletal 
features they possess.  Proper 
interpretation of pedal function requires 
knowledge of form and function in 
living humans as well as our closest 
nonhuman primate relatives.   
Figure 1: Late Pleistocene hominin foot from Flores, 
Indonesia (Jungers et al, 2009) 
Human upright striding bipedal gait 
is unique among primates and is 
associated with a distinct foot roll-over 
pattern involving heel-strike, lateral 
midfoot pressure, lateral to medial 
pressure transfer across metatarsal 
heads, and a toe-off with high loads on 
metatarsals 1-2 and toe 1.  Other 
primates exhibit higher medial midfoot 
pressures, higher lateral forefoot 
pressures, and lower toe pressure. 
The human footfall pattern is 
associated with specialized anatomical 
features including broad calcanei and 
distinctly robust fifth metatarsals.  The 
robust first metatarsal is broad dorsally, 
allowing a “close-packed” position 
during toe-off dorsiflexion rather than 
during grasping, and relatively short 
toes, decreasing mechanical work for toe 
flexors (Rolian et al, 2009).
Fossil hominids exhibit a unique 
combination of features.  The Flores foot 
possesses a modern lateral column but a 
short hallux, long lateral toes and a 
weight bearing navicular (Figure 1).
Our laboratory-based studies of 
functional anatomy in humans and other 
primates suggest that this hominin likely 
used a roll-over pattern resembling 
humans in early stance but similar to 
apes in later stance with medial midfoot 
weight bearing, a laterally-placed toe-
off, and lack of full extension or high 
loads on the toes during toe-off (Figure 
2).  Analysis of fossil footprints provides 
additional insight into pedal function in 
early hominins when examined in the 
context of modern unshod human foot 
pressure.  Taken together, 
paleontological and neontological 
studies of foot function provide deeper 
insights into modern human foot form, 
function, and pathology. 
Figure 2: Chimpanzee walking bipedally Note the 
presence of pressure in the midfoot, the high pressures 
on metatarsals 2-3, and low toe pressures.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In a previous pilot study of ‘cruisers’ (non-
independent ambulation), ‘early walkers’ (independent 
ambulation for 0 – 5 months), and ‘experienced 
walkers’ (independent ambulation for 6 – 12 months) 
developmental age significantly affected the children’s 
stability when walking and performing functional 
activities.1 The purpose of this investigation is to 
examine how shoe structural characteristics affect 
plantar pressure distribution in early walkers. 
METHODS
 
We hypothesized that torsional flexibility of 
children’s shoes affects plantar loading. Twenty-six 
children were evaluated in barefoot and each of four 
shoes that stratified a range of torsional flexibilities.  
The children were early walkers.  Plantar pressures 
were recorded barefoot and shod with Emed-X and 
Pedar-X 
systems 
(Novel, 
Munich, 
Germany) 
respectively, at self-selected comfortable walking 
speeds.  A minimum of five steps per side were 
analyzed using Novel masking software.  Peak 
pressure (PP), maximum force (MF), pressure-time 
integral (PTI), force-time integral (FTI), and contact 
area were calculated over ten masked regions.  Data 
were analyzed using a univariate mixed-effect 
ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc t tests 
where significance was found.  Footwear and 
replication were modeled as fixed and random effects, 
respectively.  Significance was set at p0.05 for 
ANOVA and p0.005 for the post-hoc tests. 
RESULTS
 
  Peak pressure (Table 1, N/cm2) for the right 
foot was significantly different across shoes for 
masked regions except the 5th MTPJ.  In general, the 
stiffest shoe (ST) had the lowest PP while the most 
flexible shoe (UF) had the highest; ST and UF were 
also the most dissimilar and similar, respectively, to 
the barefoot pressures.    Torsional flexibility (Figure 
1, deg/Nm) showed a decreasing trend with increasing 
torsion angle across all footwear types.  Highest 
flexibility was observed in the Ultraflex (pink line) 
footwear.

learning to walk.

BACKGROUND 
 
Lower extremity overuse injuries are reportedly 
the most common injuries in the military. Extreme 
values of static arch height (Williams, 2001) and the 
heavy loads commonly carried by military personnel 
in training and combat environments are associated 
with an increased risk of lower extremity overuse 
injuries (Bisiaux, 2008). While associations between 
static arch height and plantar pressure distributions 
have been demonstrated (Teyhen, 2009), limited 
knowledge exists regarding the impact of load carriage 
on plantar pressure distributions in the shod foot 
across arch types as delineated by AHI. The purpose 
of this study was to determine how load carriage 
affects dynamic plantar pressure distributions during 
gait in individuals with varying arch types. 
 
METHODS
 
One hundred and fifteen healthy service 
members (97 males, 18 females, 31.3 ± 5.6 years, 
177.1 ± 7.0 cm, 86.0 ± 11.0 kg) were enrolled in this 
study. They had no current medical condition which 
would preclude them from carrying up to a 40 kg load. 
Static measurements of heel to toe length (HTL) and 
arch height (AH) at 50% HTL were obtained with the 
Foot Assessment Platform System (FAPS) (McPoil, 
2008). Arch Height Index (AHI) was calculated by 
dividing AH by HTL. Dynamic plantar pressure 
measurements were obtained using an in-shoe pressure 
measurement system (Pedar-x, Novel Electronics, 
Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) while the subjects wore their 
own combat boots. Subjects walked for approximately 
30 seconds at 3.0 mph on a treadmill under each of 
three levels of load: uniform without additional load 
(WB), 20 kg load including weapon, helmet, and body 
armor (20kg), 40 kg load adding weighted ruck sack 
(40kg). Load carriage sequence was counterbalanced. 
 
 
DATA ANALYSIS 
Participants were categorized by arch type based 
upon accepted cutoff values for AHI resulting in 28 
high (AHI > .267), 61 normal, and 26 low (AHI < 
.229) arched right feet. An average of 9.8 ± .6 
consecutive error-free steps were analyzed for each 
load condition. Maximum force (MaxF), force time 
integral (FTI), and pressure time integral (PTI), were 
calculated for regions of the plantar foot using a nine 
sector mask. Changes in each were analyzed with a 
3×3 repeated measures ANOVA across the levels of 
load carriage and arch type. 
RESULTS
 
There was a significant interaction between arch 
type and load for the MaxF (p=.001) and FTI (p.005) 
in the medial midfoot. Although MaxF and FTI 
increased in all regions of the foot with load (p<.001) 
regardless of foot type, the forces in the medial 
midfoot were greater in those with low arches. 
 
There was a significant interaction between arch 
type and load for the MaxF (p=.004) in the medial 
forefoot. MaxF was greater in the high arched feet 
relative to normal and low arched feet (<.001) across 
all loads. The reverse was true at the great toe region, 
in which low and normal arched feet demonstrated 
greater MaxF (p .004) compared to high arched feet. 
 
The relative distribution of PTI in the nine 
regions of the plantar foot increased proportionately 
regardless of foot type under all load conditions. 
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
 
Higher forces in the medial midfoot in low 
arched feet may be related to the increased surface 
area in this region or may represent increased 
pronation. However, the relative increases in medial 
midfoot forces in low arch feet did not increase 
disproportionately with increases in load compared to 
normal or high arched feet. 
 
Force distributions in the 1st ray differed based 
on foot type. Those with high arched feet had greater 
forces in the medial forefoot region, while those with 
normal or low arched feet had greater forces in the 
great toe region, regardless of load. These differences 
in force distributions may demonstrate different 
strategies to generate a rigid lever during toe-off. 
 
Regardless of foot type, increases in load did not 
alter the relative distribution of pressure over the 
plantar foot. These findings possibly indicate a 
negligible impact of loads  40kg on footwear and 
orthoses 
prescription. 
However, 
differences 
in 
dynamic plantar pressure during gait based on AHI 
were supported.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In 1999, the ‘Kidfoot Münster’ project was 
initiated. The main scope was to investigate the 
individual development of the child’s growing foot by 
assessing foot loading patterns in a longitudinal 
project. Over 100 children were recruited for this 
purpose. In previous reports we described preliminary 
results (Bertsch 2004, Bosch 2007; 2009, Unger 
2004). Now the first group of children has 
successfully completed their nine years of study 
involvement so that we can present the changes in foot 
loading characteristics of healthy children from the 
onset of independent walking to the end of their 
elementary school age.  
MATERIAL & METHODS 
 
As soon as the children were able to walk 
without support for several meters they were invited to 
the lab for participation in this long-term investigation. 
Between 1 and 10 years of age, they were asked to 
visit the lab on 17 occasions. Initial visits were every 3 
months during the first year, twice a year until the age 
of 6 and final visits were once per year. By the end of 
2009, complete data sets of 36 children were available.  
 
Dynamic foot loading patterns were measured 
during free walking across a capacitive platform 
(emed ST or X, 4 sensors/cm2). For each foot, 5 trials 
were recorded and stored in a database (Medical 
Professional 13.3.30, Novel GmbH Munich). Five 
regions 
of 
interest 
(H=Heel, 
MF=midfoot, 
FF=forefoot, HX=hallux, LT=lateral toes) were 
analyzed with standard pressure parameters (PP=peak 
pressure, MF=maximum force, CA=contact area, 
AI=arch index).  
RESULTS
 
Average peak pressure values of the total foot 
increased over time from 141 kPa to 409 kPa. The 
highest values were initially located under the hallux 
but moved towards the heel and forefoot. The relative 
maximum force increased especially in the heel (71%) 
and forefoot (87%) but decreased in the midfoot by 
63%. Relative contact area decreased markedly under 
the midfoot. The arch index gradually decreased by 
44% up to an age of six to seven years and then 
leveled off. The range of values indicates pronounced 
inter-individual differences (Fig. 1). 
Fig. 1: Development of the arch index between the 
onset of walking and 9 years of walking experience 
(i.e. 1 to 10 years of age); 3rd, 50th & 97th percentile.  
DISCUSSION 
 
With the presented data we are able to describe – 
in more detail than before – the development of the 
child’s healthy foot with respect to dynamic loading 
parameters. The results provide a range of normal 
values for the observed age range from one to ten 
years. These data may be used for clinical applications 
when potential pathologies in pediatric orthopedics 
shall be evaluated with comparable means.  
While not overthrowing previous knowledge these 
data provide a more detailed insight into the individual 
foot development, the range of acceptable foot 
characteristics in certain ages, and finally the time 
course for the developmental changes.

Introduction 
 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA is an auto-
immune disease that may affect various joints leading 
to 
specific 
malpositions 
with 
compensatory 
movements. 
Foot 
involvement 
is 
frequently 
encountered (Spraul & Koenning). A pronounced pain 
stimulus causes the children to respond with a pain-
relieving position thus causing muscular dysbalance. 
Children with oligoarthritis can partially compensate 
the joint problems in the neighbouring joints 
maintaining an asymmetric but usually fairly smooth 
gait pattern. In children with polyarticular arthritis the 
adjacent joints are also affected and compensation is 
hardly possible. Therefore, these patients may develop 
gait pattern changes. The present study evaluated 
characteristic gait patterns in these patients in order to 
evaluate the need for specific treatment.  
Material & Methods 
 
Forty-two children, 20 oligoarthritis patients 
(OA, 15 girls/5 boys; 11.0±3.5 years) and 22 
polyarthritis patients (PA, 15 girls/7 boys; 14.2 ±3.6 
years) were examined. Clinical and pedobarographic 
data were collected during inpatient stay. Every 
participant passed a clinical examination and the 
visual analogue scale was used to assess the current 
pain intensity. Plantar pressure measurements (emed 
ST 4, Novel; 50 Hz) were carried out with the 
instruction to walk normal at self-selected speed and 
recording a step in full gait. Five valid trials of each 
foot were stored for subsequent analyses. Dynamic 
foot 
loading 
parameters 
(PP=peak 
pressure, 
FTI=force time integral) were evaluated in ten plantar 
regions of interest. Forces were normalized to body 
mass. The averaged data of right and left foot were 
used for comparisons. The Mann-Whitney U-test was 
used for statistical analysis.  
Results 
 
While the maximum PP of the total foot did not 
show statistical differences, particularly higher PP 
were found under the hindfoot in PA children (Tab. 1). 
Furthermore, significantly higher PP in the first, 
second and third to fifth metatarsal head region were 
seen in PA children. The FTI showed higher values in 
the lateral and medial hindfoot and also in the third to 
fifth metatarsal in PA patients. The clinical findings 
indicated restricted dorsiflexion and plantarflexion in 
PA patients more frequently than in OA patients.

Discussion 
 
 The present clinical data in PA patients indicates 
changes in the loading response and terminal stance 
phase. This can be considered as a potential reason for 
higher PP and FTI values under the hindfoot and 
higher PP under the metatarsals in PA patients. 
Polyarticular arthritis may cause higher  hindfoot and 
metatarsal loading as compared to oligoarthritis. This 
shows the need for preventive measures in these 
patients.

INTRODUTION 
Plantar fasciitis has been the third most common 
disease in runners, but its pathogenesis is still 
inconclusive. Changes in the longitudinal plantar arch 
and mechanical overload on the feet, have been 
described as risk factors for developing plantar 
fasciitis1,2,3,4. 
However, 
there 
are 
few 
studies 
investigating 
these 
factors 
during 
running 
in 
individuals with and without plantar fasciitis. Most of 
the literature investigated biomechanical parameters of 
the plantar fasciitis during gait and the results are still 
controversial, mainly because it is unclear the effect of 
pain associated with the disease over those parameters. 
Wearing et al. (2007)3 discussed that symptomatic 
individuals make some adaptations during gait to 
reduce forces over the rearfoot and, consequently, 
increase loads over adjacent foot areas, such as over 
the mid and forefoot, as also observed by some 
authors1,3. According to biomechanical studies, it is 
possible that the plantar pressure distribution in 
individuals with plantar fasciitis would be different 
during the symptomatic and asymptomatic phases of 
the disease, and the pattern could be even more 
different during running. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the association between plantar 
fasciitis and its pain symptom with the longitudinal 
plantar arch (LPA) shape and plantar pressure 
distribution during running. 
METHODS
Ninety recreational runners were studied: 45 had 
plantar fasciitis (PF): symptomatic 30-SPF (45.4±8.1 
yr, 69.6±14.0 kg, 1.68±9.2 m) and asymptomatic 15-
APF (38.3±3.3 yr, 72.3±10.0 kg, 1.76±7.8 m) and 60 
were healthy controls (CG) (35.0±9.0 yr, 66.8±12.0 
kg, 1.71±9.0 m). Pain was assessed by a visual 
analogue scale (VAS). The LPA was evaluated by 
digital photogrammetry during weight bearing static 
posture5. The index between 0.22 – 0.25 was used to 
classified the LPA as normal; < 0.21 cavus; > 0.26 
valgus5. The plantar pressure was evaluated by Pedar 
X system during running of 40 meters at a speed of 
12±5% km/h. Runners used a common standardized 
sport footwear. Contact area, contact time and 
pressure peak were evaluated in 5 areas: rearfoot 
(medial and lateral), midfoot and forefoot (medial and 
lateral). Groups were compared using ANOVAs for 
repeated measures, followed by Tukey post-hoc tests 
(p<0.05). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
SPF group reported mean time since onset of pain of 
7±2 months and pain levels of 5±2 cm. In APF and 
CG groups, the pain level was 0 cm. The LPA was 
more elevated in both groups with plantar fasciitis: 
symptomatic (0.17±0.08; cavus LPA; p=0.009) and 
asymptomatic (0.17±0.07; cavus LPA; p=0.008), 
compared to controls (0.22±0.05; normal LPA).

The cavus architecture of the LPA would lead to 
greater strain in the plantar fascia during static and, 
mostly, during dynamic activities, such as running. 
Chronically, these stresses will cause micro traumas in 
the plantar fascia and, probably, will lead to the 
progression of PF symptoms or even to the onset of 
PF. However, the plantar pressure distribution during 
running did not demonstrate association to the PF or 
its pain symptom. 
CONCLUSION 
The plantar fasciitis and the pain symptom are not 
associated to the plantar pressure distribution patterns 
during running. However, runners with plantar 
fasciitis with or without pain symptom present cavus 
LPA and more elevated arch compared to controls.

INTRODUCTION 
Displaced 
intra-articular 
fractures 
of 
the 
calcaneus represent a complex injury typically 
affecting middle-aged active population. The 
ideal goal of open reduction with internal 
fixation in these fractures is to recreate the 
calcaneus width, height and length, the subtalar 
joint congruency, the soft tissue balancing, and 
consequently the foot and ankle kinematics. It is 
not known whether operative intervention for 
these injuries provide any advantage to non-
operative management in terms of recreating the 
normal foot and ankle kinematics during the gait 
cycle. The current study was designed to assess 
the plantar pressure profiles of the foot following 
open reduction with internal fixation of high 
grade intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus.  
METHODS
The study sample included 14 operated patients 
and 8 control healthy subjects. Plantar pressure 
distribution was collected during walking on a 
level floor at a natural preferred cadence with 
Pedar-x system (Novel gmbh, Munich). 10 zones 
of the plantar area of the foot were defined. The 
subjects walked using the same shoe model on a 
level floor at natural preferred cadence. Plantar 
pressure data were collected over 4 cycles. For 
each step the pressure time integral (PTI) 
[Ns/cm2] was calculated for each zone. In the 
injured group, the sound limb was compared 
with the injured limb. In addition, the sound limb 
and the injured limb were separately compared 
with the control group (16 feet). Because some 
of the variables did not fulfill the assumptions of 
normality that underlie parametric statistics, a 
non-parametric approach was applied using the 
Mann-Whitney 
test 
for 
between 
samples 
comparisons. A p value of 0.05 was considered 
significant.
RESULTS
In eight of the ten masks PTI was significantly 
lower in the involved legs than in the healthy 
sample. PTI of the injured group was expressed 
as percentage of the healthy group. The relative 
means of the PTIIs of the involved legs were 
lesser in the medial aspect than the lateral aspect 
of the foot (MH-42% vs. LH-80%, MMF- 35% 
vs. LMF-103% ns, 1MTT-51% & 2MMT- 67% 
vs. LMTT-81% ns, 1TOE-23% & 2TOE-15% 
vs. LTOE-51%). Similar trends characterize the 
uninvolved leg. Thus, injured patients adopt a 
modified gait pattern typified by reduced plantar 
pressure, particularly on the medial aspect of the 
foot.  
DISCUSION 
Both limbs of operated patients demonstrated a 
similar PTI pattern of relative reduction, 
particularly in the medial aspect, compared to the 
healthy feet. The cause for this pattern remains 
unclear at this point. A potential explanation for 
the similar pattern of the injured and sound limbs 
is that over the years since the operative 
intervention and the rehabilitation process, 
patients may have implemented compensatory 
mechanisms in their non-operated limbs to 
prevent chronic over-loading of one side caused 
by gait asymmetry.  The observed symmetry in 
gait adjustment may be related to the self-
selected walking velocity chosen by each patient, 
and could indicate good functional recovery as 
related to walking. However, measuring at self 
selected gait velocities could potentially mask 
kinematical differences between operated and 
contra-lateral non-operated limbs that could 
emerge in higher locomotive velocities or during 
perturbations while running, walking on uneven 
terrains and side sloped surfaces.

INTRODUCTION:  
Hip fractures are regarded as the most common severe 
type of fall-related injury concerning elderly people 
and the most serious of the osteoporotic fractures 
because of their high morbidity, mortality and 
impairment in quality of life. (2-5). 
Pertrochanteric and femoral neck fractures of the 
femur, with respect to healing, may be regarded as 
fracture-types with long rehabilitation time. (1)  
Current rehabilitation protocols of patients following 
operative treatment recommend full weight-bearing on 
the operated extremity as early as possible. The 
present study seeks to highlight the reactions to early 
loading under the aspect of pain-control.  In-shoe 
pressure redistribution to provide relief of 
postoperative mobilisation is based on assumed links 
between pressure and pain. However, little is known 
about pain-associated loading after operative treatment 
of hip fractures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:  
29 patients, who had an operative treatment of a 
fracture of the femoral neck or a pertrochanteric 
fracture, were allowed to full weight-bearing as 
tolerated on the injured limb. 12 man and 17 women, 
ranging in age from 45 to 96 years, took part in this 
study at our center. During postoperative mobilization 
elderly patients were allowed to practise full weight-
bearing while loading of the injured limb was mostly 
limited due to pain in the early postoperative period. 
Gait analysis was performed by using the novel 
PEDAR in-shoe plantar pressure measurement system 
(novel GmbH, Munich, Germany). Computerized gait-
testing was performed at one, seven and twelve days 
postoperatively 
to
quantify 
weight-bearing 
in 
association with pain. 
Visual analog scale (VAS) score of pain were obtained 
from all subjects before and after testing with the 
PEDAR-system. Statistical analysis was used to 
analyze the relationship between the plantar pressure 
parameters and VAS scores in the period of 
hospitalisation. Pearson's correlation was applied to 
analyze the correlation between the changes in plantar 
pressure parameters and VAS scores. Statistical 
significance was set as p < 0.05. 
RESULTS:  
The average amount of weight these patients placed on 
the injured limb increased during the time of 
hospitalisation. During mobilisation maximum peak 
pressure (MPP), maximum pressure-time integral 
(PTI) increased at the seventh and twelfth day after 
surgery. In analogy, subjective pain scores decreased 
significantly during hospitalisation. 6 of 29 patients 
were measured at a fixed follow-up. For these 6 
patients the increase in the PTI and MPP values were 
statistically correlated with the improvement in VAS
scores (r = 0.8) in the course of follow up. 
The average load supported by the injured limb was 
70.4 (43.8-83.1) % of the uninjured limb after three
days, and gradually increased to 91.1 (75.4-96.2) % at 
twelve days.  
DISCUSSION:  
This study investigated plantar pressure related to pain 
during gait in subjects at different time points after 
operative treatment of hip fractures. Plantar pressure 
came up to 40 to 90 % of the uninjured limb. 
Furthermore, a positive correlation of gait parameters 
with 
the 
improvement 
in 
VAS 
exists. 
Correspondingly, gait and balance disturbances caused 
by hip pain have an influence on dynamic plantar 
pressure distribution. Our subjects presented a worse 
load distribution pattern during gait at the beginning of 
hospitalisation overloading the midfoot and the 
rearfoot. These changes could be associated with pain 
pathogenesis 
that 
worsens 
the 
biomechanical 
condition of these patients and their clinical 
consequences
CONCLUSION: 
Following operative treatment we recommend pain-
associated full weight-bearing on the operated 
extremity as early as possible to avoid specific 
consequences on postural balance control; the 
reactions to early loading under the aspect of pain-
control may provide a faster mobility after operative 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Foot morphology and plantar loading may differ 
between ethnicities (Veves, 1995).  Our previous work 
suggested altered loading strategies may exist between 
elite athletes of MƗori and New Zealand Caucasian 
(‘NZC’) ethnicity (Gurney, 2009). 
 
MƗori suffer disproportionately from diabetes 
and particularly its complications, including foot 
ulceration (Joshy, 2006).  If MƗori exhibit altered foot 
morphology 
and 
function, 
perhaps 
different 
preventative strategies are required for reducing 
diabetic foot complications in MƗori, such as footwear 
modifications. 
 
Therefore the purpose of this study was to 
investigate the static morphology and dynamic 
function of the MƗori foot in both healthy and diabetic 
populations compared to NZC controls.  It was 
hypothesised 
that 
based 
on 
previous 
findings 
significant differences would be observed between 
ethnicities. 
 
METHODS 
 
A total of 40 participants were further divided 
into 10 MƗori (8f; 42±11yrs; BMI 27±5) and 10 NZC 
(8f; 
43±11yrs; 
BMI 
26±4) 
who 
had 
no 
neuromusculoskeletal injury, plus 10 MƗori (5f; 
58±11yrs; BMI 32±5) and 10 NZC (5f; 60±10yrs; 
BMI 30±3) diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes.   
        Plantar pressure was evaluated using a Novel 
EMED-AT system (Novel GmBh, Munich, Germany) 
at a frequency of 50Hz during walking at a self-
selected speed.  Following familiarisation five trials 
were collected for each foot (Hughes et al., 1991). 
 
Static morphology was measured using Harris 
mat techniques.  Foot length, heel width, forefoot 
width, and arch index were determined.  The latter 
was calculated as the width of the narrowest part of 
the midfoot divided by toeless foot length.    
        Plantar pressure data were analysed using Novel 
software, in which the foot was divided into 10 
regions.  Multiple pressure parameters were analysed. 
       Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
tests 
confirmed 
data 
normality.  Independent T-tests were then used to test 
for significant differences between ethnic groups in 
both the healthy and diabetic participants (p = <0.05).   
RESULTS 
 
Arch index was found to be significantly greater 
in the healthy MƗori compared to the healthy NZC, 
but this difference was not observed when comparing 
diabetic groups.  No other static morphological 
differences were found between ethnicities. 
 
Few significant differences were found between 
ethnicities, healthy or diabetic, in terms of dynamic 
plantar loading.  Peak pressures under the central 
forefoot were found to be significantly greater in 
diabetic MƗori compared to diabetic NZC (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The hypothesis that significant morphological 
and functional differences would be found between 
MƗori and NZC feet was mostly proven incorrect.  
Since the compared groups were largely homogenous, 
we can conclude that MƗori ethnicity alone may not 
affect foot morphology and function in healthy and 
diabetic populations.  This may suggest that no special 
considerations are required when clinically treating or 
designing preventative care for diabetic MƗori at risk 
of plantar ulceration.  However further research is 
required on larger groups and non-urbanised MƗori.

INTRODUCTION 
The adjusted prevalence of diabetes among Native 
Americans has increased by 26.9%, from 6.7% to 
8.5%, between 1996 and 2006 (Jernigan et al., 2010).  
On average, Native Americans are 2.3 times as likely 
to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of similar age 
(Burrows, 2000).  Plantar ulceration is a common 
problem in individuals with diabetes. Among those 
with diabetes, 24% will require an amputation of the 
foot and/or leg (Lott et al., 2008). 
Peak plantar pressure and pressure-time integral are 
two variables used to screen individuals with diabetes 
and neuropathy for the development of foot ulcers 
(Brown et al., 2004, Sauseng et al., 1999, Stess et al., 
1997).  The role asymmetry in plantar pressures has 
not investigated in Native Americans.     
Our aim was to investigate plantar loading 
asymmetry during gait in Native Americans with no 
diabetes (ND), diabetes (D) and diabetes with 
neuropathy (D-NP).  
METHODS
Ninety-eight Native American’s volunteered to 
participate in the study (mean age 50.3 yrs; 19-86).  
Twenty three individuals had diabetes (D), 14 had 
diabetes with peripheral neuropathy (D-PN) and 61 
did not have diabetes (ND).  Neuropathy status was 
determined with a biothesiometer (> 25 V threshold).  
Twenty-four percent of participants were overweight 
(>25-29.9 BMI) and 59% were obese (>30 BMI).    
Plantar pressure data were collected using an 
EMED-AT floor mounted capacitance based platform 
sampling at 50 Hz. The 2-step method was used to 
obtain plantar loading data from five trials of each 
foot.  Each plantar loading trial was subdivided into 
ten specific plantar regions for analysis.  Differences 
in the absolute value of peak pressure and peak 
pressure-time integral of feet were examined across 
metatarsal regions using an Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA).  Separate ANOVA’s were run on peak 
pressure and pressure time integral for each of the 
metatarsal regions (alpha = 0.05).  
RESULTS
     Peak pressure asymmetry was different between 
feet across each the metatarsal regions 1-3 of the 
plantar surface during gait (p < 0.05).  Table 1 depicts 
the asymmetry in pressure-time integrals between feet 
across metatarsal regions of the plantar surface (p < 
0.05).  Post hoc comparisons indicated that individuals 
without diabetes (ND) displayed less asymmetric 
loading described by peak pressure in metatarsal 1-3 
regions and pressure-time integral across all metatarsal 
regions than those with diabetes (D) and diabetes with 
peripheral neuropathy (D-PN).

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Native Americans with diabetes appeared to 
show greater asymmetry in plantar loading variables 
across the forefoot region compared to controls.  
Individuals with neuropathy and diabetes had the 
greatest amount of asymmetry with pressure time 
integral across these regions.  Loading asymmetry 
may pose a role in the development of wounds in 
Native Americans with peripheral neuropathy and 
diabetes.  Further research is warranted.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is 
widely used to assess the disability of patients with 
multiple sclerosis (MS). The EDSS quantifies 
disability in eight functional systems (FS).  
 
The aim of this study was to obtain the plantar 
pressure distribution images in MS patients with 
different neurological status (EDSS) and to estimate 
the plantar pressure distribution parameters changes.  
METHODS
 
106 patients (33m/73f, age 39r10 years), 
diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (duration of 
MS 8r6 years) according to McDonald’s criteria, were 
examined. Neurological status of examined patients 
was characterized with EDSS 3.4r1.2. Patients were 
divided into five groups in relation to estimated EDSS: 
EDSS [1,1.5] (no disability), EDSS [2,2.5] (minimal 
disability), EDSS [3,3.5] (disability in mild to 
moderate), EDSS [4,4.5] (severe disability), and EDSS 
[5,6.5] (increasing limitation in ability to walk, 
walking assistance is needed). All patients received 
permanent pathogenetic therapy. 
 
Plantar pressure measurements were performed 
with emed-AT 25 system (novel, Munich, Germany). 
Five dynamic records of each foot were made with 
first step protocol. novel database medical was used to 
collect clinical and pressure measurement data. Peak 
pressure (PP), mean pressure (MP), maximum force 
(MF), pressure-time integrals (PTI), force-time 
integrals (FTI), contact time (CT) and arch index (AI) 
were calculated in novel-projects with novel automask 
for hindfoot, midfoot, five metatarsal heads (MH1-
MH5), big toe, second toe and lateral toes. Parameters 
were calculated for each subject and for five groups. 
The difference in pressure distribution parameters 
under the foot areas was checked with ANOVA. 
Significance level was set as p<0.001. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Each group had a specific plantar pressure 
distribution pattern that varied with a degree of 
disability status. The patients from Gr.2 (vs. Gr.1) 
were characterized with decreased MP under the 
hindfoot, increased MF and FTI under MH5 and FTI 
under MH4; increased CT under the foot and foot 
regions. Significantly decreased PP, MP, MF, FTI, and 
PTI under the hindfoot, MH4 and MH5, increased 
FTI, PTI, and contact time (% roll over process) under 
MH1, increased MF under the midfoot and AI were 
found in patients from Gr.3 (vs. Gr.2). Decreased PP, 
MF and FTI under MH2 were found in Gr.4 (vs. Gr.3). 
At the same time PP, MP, MF, PTI and FTI were 
significantly increased under MH4 and MH5 and 
decreased under MH1; MF and FTI were decreased 
under the midfoot together with AI and reached the 
values comparable with parameters from Gr.2. 
Significant decrease of PP, MP, MF under MH2, 
MH3, MH4 and midfoot, decreased AI, increased FTI 
and PTI under MH1 were found in Gr.5 (vs. Gr.4) in 
concert with significant increase of CT under the foot 
and all foot regions.  
 
Medial shift of loading is comprehensible 
because the first ray is the most appropriate structure 
used in weight bearing to provide an additional 
security. Reduced parameters under the second and 
third metatarsal heads can be explained with the 
development of the transverse arch in the forefoot with 
an increase of spasticity. Lower loading of midfoot 
(with decreased arch index) is supposed to be because 
of an increase of longitudinal arch height. The 
hindfoot off-loading could be a sequence of the foot 
circumduction and inversion during the gait. First 
signs of significant changes of all parameters occurred 
in MS patients with moderate disability can be 
regarded as a result of disability in several function 
systems. 
CONCLUSION 
 
These results confirmed that patients with 
minimal disability have minimal gait impairments. 
Patients with mild and moderate disability reveal the 
changes in decreasing hindfoot and lateral forefoot 
loading with medial shift of loading. MS patients with 
severe disability showed decreased parameters in 
central forefoot. Patients with limited ability to walk 
have stable pathologically changed plantar pressure 
distribution pattern characterized with low values of 
all parameters and significantly decreased loading of 
hindfoot, midfoot, forefoot with medial shift of 
loading.

INTRODUCTION 
The transition from standing posture to cyclic 
walking is a special challenge to be mastered by 
young children. It is the result of anticipatory postural 
adjustments before stepping. Studies on this matter 
with children have focused on force plate data and 
electromyographic responses (Stackhouse et al., 2007; 
Wicart et al., 2006) in clinical contexts. The aim of 
this study is to verify whether gait initiation can be 
measured with the EMED system in order to 
understand the relative contribution of foot structure in 
this process. Besides, as the medial longitudinal arch 
of young children is in progress, the role of the 
development of foot functions on this process could 
also be assessed. 
METHODOLOGY 
Antero-posterior and medio-lateral displacements 
of the center of pressure at the foot/floor interface and 
the Chippaux-Smirak Index (CSI) were measured 
during gait initiation in 20 Brazilian school children 
aged 3.7 (±0.7) years and with body mass of 17.3 
(±2.3) kg. The dynamic data were obtained with the 
EMED-ST System (NOVEL, Germany), sampled at 
50Hz and foot indexes were measured with foot prints 
in bipedal stance. Three to five valid trials of gait 
initiation were collected. The children stood still over 
the plate and after a “go” signal they performed the 
gait initiation and continued to walk for about 6 m. 
The walking speed was freely selected by each child 
and all were barefoot.       
RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
 
The CSI classified of 80% of the children as flat-
footed (CSI ranged from 49% to 69% for right and left 
feet). The average displacements of the center of 
pressure 
in 
antero-posterior 
and 
medio-lateral 
directions relative to the plate system were analysed. 
The results of one child are presented (Fig.1 & Tab.1). 
At 70% of the stance phase the anticipatory behavior 
to the step begins. The range of COP_ML motion 
toward the stance foot is 9.2 (±1.44) cm, which 
represents 1.3 times the forefoot width, whereas the 
COP_AP range of motion is 12.6 (±0.,7) cm, 
equivalent to 0.80 times the foot length of this child. 
The maximum COP_ML and the minimum COP_AP 
motions represent the displacements toward the 
stepping foot and the backward direction respectively. 
It is interesting to note that these very small motions in 
the directions opposite to the step are insufficient to 
identify anticipatory behavior.

Ledebt et al. (1998), on the other hand, found 
significant COP displacements for children of the 
same age. Since both feet were in contact with the 
platform, the system could not quantify the loading 
shift from one foot to the other as gait starts, but it was 
possible to measure the dynamic behavior of the COP 
before stepping, which may be of importance to 
follow individuals with gait and balance disorders.

INTRODUCTION  
It is not widely known if foot static range of 
movement restriction influences abnormal plantar 
pressure distribution in patients with diabetic 
neuropathy, and thus be associated with higher 
chances of plantar ulcers occurrences. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the static active range of 
motion (ROM) of the ankle (AJ) and the first 
metatarsophalangeal joints (1st MTF), plantar pressure 
distribution during gait, and the relationship between 
these pressure and ROM variables in diabetic 
neuropathic patients and non-diabetic individuals. 
METHODS
Thirty six young adults participated in this study: 
control group (CG, n=18, 43±9yrs) and diabetic 
neuropathic group (NG, n=18, 57±4yrs), matched in 
body mass (p=.10), height (p=.98), but not in age 
(p<.01). Static active ROM of the 1st MTF and AJ 
joints were measured in sagittal plane using a manual 
goniometer and an electrogoniometer, respectively. 
Plantar pressure (Pedar X system, Novel) was 
analyzed during barefoot walking with antiskid socks, 
in 5 areas: rearfoot, midfoot, lateral and medial 
forefoot and hallux. General linear model for repeated 
measures ANOVAs were used to compare groups in 
the studied areas. ROM of both joints were compared 
between groups using t test. Pearson coefficients were 
calculated to test correlation between ROM and 
pressure variables in both groups. 
RESULTS
NG presented smaller 1st MTF and AJ ROMs (table 
1), smaller contact area at the rearfoot, higher 
pressure-time integral at the rearfoot, and smaller peak 
pressure at the hallux (table 2). There was a moderate 
and significant correlation between pressure-time 
integral at the hallux and 1st MTF ROM (r=.44, 
p=.06), and between pressure-time integral at the 
rearfoot and 1st MTF ROM (r=.48, p=.04) in the NG, 
but not in CG.

DISCUSSION 
The results demonstrated that the 1st MTP motion 
restriction play an important role in NG patients by 
changing the foot rollover mechanism during gait, and 
consequently the plantar pressure, particularly at the 
hallux. This may explain the lower pressures at the 
hallux and the increased pressure-time integral at 
rearfoot in diabetic subjects. These findings are in 
accordance with other authors that had also described 
the same trend and suggested that the neuropathy 
influences the loading and patterns of walking (Turner 
et al, 2007). Nurse and Nigg (2001) found that peak 
pressure and pressure-time integral were significantly 
higher in areas of normal sensitivity and lower at the 
insensate areas, and the center of pressure (COP) 
under the foot shifted away from areas of decreased 
sensitivity when sensory input is reduced from a 
portion of the foot. Sacco et al (2009a) found 
reduction of peak pressure at the hallux during gait in 
neuropathic patients wearing shoes. Giacomozzi and 
Caselli (2002) found that, in this population, the COP 
excursion was shorter longitudinally, so the metatarsal 
heads left the floor earlier in the stance phase. Sacco et 
al (2009b) studied this altered foot rollover and argued 
that it was associated with less dynamic mobility and 
altered plantar pressure distribution. Our results 
confirm that an altered ROM, especially at the hallux, 
can produce alterations in pressures, potentially 
increasing the risk of ulcer formation. 
CONCLUSION 
In clinical practice, we could use this non-
sophisticated measuring tool (1st MTF ROM by 
manual goniometer) to predict a potential pressure 
alteration in neuropathic patients during walking. This 
ROM alteration would indicate a condition more 
susceptible to injuries and plantar ulcerations.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Total contact casting (TCC) is a common off-
loading strategy in individuals with plantar ulcers 
secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral 
neuropathy (PN).  Cast-boot ankle-foot orthoses 
(AFO) may offer a lower-cost alternative to TCC. 
 
The purpose of this analysis was to assess the 
off-loading capabilities of the cast-boot AFO by 
comparing the plantar loading patterns in TCC and 
AFO for subjects with DM, PN, and plantar ulcers.  
Specifically, we assessed the reduction in plantar loads 
in the hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot in each off-
loading device compared to unshod walking. 
METHODS
 
Twenty-three subjects with DM, PN, and a 
plantar ulcer gave informed consent and were  
randomly assigned to off-loading treatment with either 
TCC (n=11) or AFO (n=12).  Subjects first walked 
unshod across an EMED pressure platform (Novel 
Inc., St. Paul, MN).  Next, subjects walked across a 6-
meter walkway at preferred walking speed with a 
Novel Pedar pressure insole (Novel Inc., St. Paul, 
MN) placed in the off-loading device (TCC or AFO) 
on the ulcerated foot.  The EMED trials effectively 
created an individualized “baseline” value for 
comparison with each subject’s TCC or AFO trial. 
 
For both Pedar and EMED trials, the plantar 
pressure map was divided into 3 masks reflecting the 
hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. Multiple steps were 
averaged on each subject’s ulcerated side for contact 
area [cm2], contact time [ms], maximum force [N], 
peak pressure [N/cm2], force-time integral [N*s], and 
pressure-time integral [N*s/cm2].  The effects of TCC 
and AFO were assessed using analysis of covariance, 
with walking speed and the EMED value of the 
outcome variable included as covariates. Mean values 
for TCC and AFO are reported as estimated marginal 
means in order to account for variability due to 
walking speed and EMED values. 
RESULTS
 
No differences in estimated marginal means 
were found in the hindfoot mask, though there was a 
trend towards higher force-time integral in the AFO 
condition compared to TCC (p=0.071).   Similarly, no 
differences were found in the midfoot mask, though 
there was a trend towards higher peak pressure in the 
TCC condition compared to AFO (p=0.052). 
 
In the forefoot mask, the AFO showed greater 
off-loading capability for force and pressure-related 
outcomes.  The TCC condition had significantly 
higher estimated marginal means than the AFO 
condition for maximum force (p=0.012) and force-
time integral (p=0.010). Similarly, the TCC condition 
had significantly higher values compared to the AFO 
condition for peak pressure (p=0.011) and pressure-
time integral (p=0.007).   
 
Results are summarized in Table 1 below. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The cast-boot AFO yielded significantly greater 
reductions in force and pressure variables in the 
forefoot region of individuals with DM, PN, and 
plantar ulcers, suggesting that AFO may provide a 
viable, low-cost off-loading strategy for forefoot 
ulcers.  Further research is needed to determine 
whether the load reductions seen in AFO correspond 
to improved healing rates.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE 
Ankle foot orthotics are often prescribed to individuals 
with hemiplegia to assist with ambulation.1 Gait speed 
has been used as a primary indicator of orthotic 
effectiveness, and improved functional ambulation.2 
Limited research has been conducted to understand the 
specific mechanisms leading to improved gait speed 
after orthotic intervention. Changes in impulse during 
the first rocker (braking force) and third rocker 
(propulsion force) may directly affect changes in gait 
speed after othotic intervention.3 Therefore the 
purpose of this investigation was to objectively 
measure changes in impulse during double support 
and correlate those finding to changes in gait speed 
with and without AFO in individuals with hemiplegia. 
 
METHODS
 
SUBJECTS: Fifteen individuals with hemiplegia 
(age 51 ± 12 y, height 1.72 ± 12.2 m, mass 85 ± 21 kg) 
greater than six months currently using an AFO during 
ambulation.   
 
PROCEDURES: Subjects performed 10 walking 
trials at a self-selected pace in two conditions, with 
and without AFO. During all walking trials, foot 
pressure data was collected using the Pedar®-x Expert 
System (Novel Electronics Inc., St Paul, MN, USA).  
The main outcome measures were gait cycle time 
(sec), mean force (bodyweights), and impulse (mean 
force x time) in the, wholefoot, hindfoot (heel and 
arch) and forefoot (metatarsal heads, toes, and hallux), 
during initial double support (IDS) and terminal 
double support (TDS). 
 
 
ANALYSIS: Wholefoot, hindfoot, and forefoot 
impulse were calculated in custom Matlab programs 
by integrating the local forces under specific 
anatomical regions during IDS and TDS. Independent 
sample t-tests were used to test for significant 
differences with and without AFO (p0.05). 
RESULTS
 
Gait cycle timing significantly decreased with 
the AFO during the entire gait cycle (p=0.034), initial 
double support (IDS; p=0.034), single support (SS; 
p=.030), and terminal double support (TDS; p=0.048). 
During IDS, impulse on the affected limb significantly 
decreased in the wholefoot (with 0.052±0.016, without 
0.086±0.57; p=0.016) and hindfoot (with 0.037±0.012, 
without 
0.060±0.032; 
p=0.006), 
and 
remained 
relatively 
unchanged 
in 
the 
forefoot 
(with 
0.016±0.007, without 0.025±0.027; p=0.14). Mean 
force during IDS on the affected limb also 
significantly decreased in the wholefoot (p=0.0029) 
and hindfoot (p=0.0069). During IDS, hindfoot 
impulse % change and velocity % change during a 
two-minute 
walk 
were 
significantly 
correlated 
(R2=0.44, p=0.007, figure 1). During TDS, impulse on 
the affected limb was not significantly different in the 
wholefoot, hindfoot or forefoot (with 0.062±0.020, 
without 0.069±0.026; p=0.37). Mean force during 
TDS on the affected limb significantly increased in the 
wholefoot 
(p=0.0002) 
and 
remained 
relatively 
unchanged in the forefoot (with 0.30±0.11, without 
0.27±0.10; p=0.28).  
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Researchers have shown orthotics increase gait 
speed; this research suggests that the increase in speed 
is not due to increased propulsive forces at the end of 
TDS, but due to decreased breaking forces during IDS. 
The AFO provides increased dorsiflexion at footstrike 
creating a decreased impulse (breaking force) in the 
hindfoot thereby preserving the first ankle rocker and 
providing a more efficient weight acceptance and 
positively affected gait speed. Future research is 
required 
to 
fully 
understand 
the 
mechanisms 
underlying the increases in gait speed associated with 
orthotic intervention in adults with hemiplegia.

INTRODUCTION: 
A customized dynamic pedorthosis has been 
developed to prevent recurrence of the treated 
clubfoot. This new pedorthosis was developed using 
our OrthoticPro™, a software package that utilizes 
dynamic plantar pressure data, and computer aided 
engineering tools. The pedorthosis is constructed 
using rapid prototyping technologies (RP).  The 
purpose of this research was to: 1) compare the 
pressure metrics between barefoot in regular shoes and 
the pedorthosis, 2) quantify the deviation of the center 
of pressure (COP) trajectory from the normal 
trajectory with and without the use of the pedorthosis, 
and 3) develop a FEA model to predict this 
effectiveness of wedges. 
METHODS:
Five typically developing children (average age 
7.2 years, 2 girls and 3 boys) and five clubfoot patients 
with (average age 6 years 1 girl and 4 boys) were 
recruited. The finite element model was generated 
using CT based geometry and plantar pressure (Emed, 
Novel Inc., MN). The pedorthosis was constructed 
from the CAD model and manufactured using the RP 
(Stereolitography). Eight-pedorthtoses were fitted to 
the children with clubfoot and the children were 
measured during walking with and without orthotics 
using the Pedar insole pressure system (Novel Inc., 
MN). 
RESULTS: 
There was significant reduction of the average 
COP deviation following the use of the pedorthosis. 
The maximum reduction of the average COP deviation 
occurred in the forefoot (7.87%) and then the midfoot 
(4.00%). There are no significant differences of any 
pressure measurements at the midfoot, medial 
forefoot, and entire toes. Significant reduction of 
maximal force, peak pressure, and loading at the heel 
and the lateral forefoot are identified following the use 
of the new pedorthosis (P<0.05) (Figure 1). 
DISCUSSION: 
This kinetic change may imply a reduced 
supination of the forefoot in children with residual 
clubfoot. Our short-term follow-up demonstrates that 
the pedorthosis improves the dynamic misalignments 
in the residual clubfoot. A customized wedge as 
predicted by FEA indicates a corrective magnitude of 
the wedge angle which varies along the forefoot and 
midfoot regions.

Introduction
 
In the literature the effect of insoles is discussed 
controversial 1, 2, 3. The aim of our study was firstly to 
find a correlation between kinematic, kinetic and 
electromyographic changes during gait caused by the 
application of different insoles. Secondly we were 
interested in the change of the intraarticular force in 
the knee and the change of muscle forces in the leg. 
Methods
 
We examined 10 healthy subjects using 5 
different insoles alternatively with a neutral insole. 
The kinematic measurements were performed with a 
Vicon MX System (6 Cameras). Additionally we used 
an AMTI force platform and a Novel SF pressure 
measurement System, even though a Pedar (Novel) 
insole pressure measurement system. The EMG was 
measured with a MegaWin system, synchronized with 
the Vicon system. The intraarticular reaction forces in 
the medial and the lateral compartment oft the knee 
were calculated with the help of a finite element 
model (ANSYS) of the leg which is considered as a 
rough estimate based on CT Scans. The muscle forces 
were determined using a slightly modified model from 
the 
repository 
AMMRV1.1 
of 
ANYBODY 
TECHNOLOGY (Vaughan). 
Results
 
Opposite to the literature we found that there is, 
for some kinematic parameters, a more or less unique 
change due to different insoles. The insoles with a 
medial wedge, for example, showed a significant 
decrease of eversion of the hindfoot and the insoles 
with a lateral wedge showed a significant increase of 
eversion. A more interesting result was the calculation 
of the intraarticular reaction force in the medial and 
lateral compartment of our knee model. In figure 1 the 
pink curve shows the reaction force in the lateral knee 
compartment in % Bodyweight with an insole with a 
medial wedge. Nearly the same curve (blue line) 
shows the measurement with a neutral insole. A 
significant decreased reaction force could only be 
observed when we simulated a stiff ankle joint that 
means inversion and eversion of the ankle joint was 
excluded in our simulation. 
Using our muscle model we found no significant 
change of muscle forces in the whole leg. Opposite to 
that we found a significant increase of all thigh 
extensors comparing barefoot gait with gait in shoes 
with neutral insoles.

DISCUSSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
 
The 
findings 
concerning 
the 
kinematic 
parameters  of the ankle joint confirm more or less the 
clinical assumptions. But the clinical conclusion, that 
the changing of these parameters influence the 
reaction forces in the knee, could not be confirmed 
without reservations. The results of our simulations 
shows clearly that the effect of an insole will be 
completely compensated by the ankle joint. There is 
no effect on muscle forces of the leg or joint reaction 
forces in the knee if the ankle is enough mobile. 
Because the muscle forces are significantly increased, 
when gait analysis is performed with shoes, in the 
future it will be necessary to do the clinical gait 
analysis not only barefoot as hitherto.

INTRODUCTION
 The differences of lateral and medial patellofemoral forces in 
different total knee arthroplasty (TKA) designs have not been 
extensively studied.  The purpose of this study was to measure 
the distribution of patellofemoral forces in native and TKA 
cadaver knees utilizing sensor technology performed in a 
simulated operative environment.  Currently the criteria for 
evaluating the success of soft tissue balancing in TKA involves 
only the surgeon’s observation of intraoperative patellar tracking 
during a passive range of motion, but no good objective measure 
of patellar tracking has been described.  We propose that the 
ratio of lateral to medial maximum force and peak pressure may 
be used as a surrogate marker for patellar tracking.  
METHODS
The patellofemoral forces of 6 knees from 3 fresh-frozen half-
body female cadavers (mean age 82 years) were evaluated with 
a capacitive sensor placed on the patellofemoral articulation in 
staged clinical scenarios.  The half-body cadavers were placed 
supine with the pelvis stabilized such that all study aspects were 
similar to an actual operative procedure.  The medial 
parapatellar approach was used and the patella was everted in 
the standard fashion. The sensor device, capacitive novel pliance 
system (Novel Electronics, St. Paul, MN), was sutured over the 
patellar surface and the joint capsule closed using 3 sutures.  
 Staged clinical scenarios tested were native knees (NKNP, 6 
knees), total knee replacement without patellar resurfacing 
(RKNP, 6 knees), resurfaced knee and patella (RKRP, 6 knees), 
resurfaced knee and patella with lateral release (RKRP-LR, 3 
knees), gender-specific knee with patella resurfacing (GKRP, 3 
knees), and gender-specific knee with lateral release (GKRP-
LR, 3 knees).  Maximum force (N) and peak pressure (kPa) 
were simultaneously recorded over a set of 3-4 ranges of 
motion.  Average values were compared for the medial and 
lateral patella compartments and for different clinical settings.   
     Component alignment, stability, and patellar tracking were 
clinically acceptable by direct visualization in all scenarios. 
 A student t-test with a pooled sample variance was used in 
comparisons, and the assumption of equal sample variances 
between lateral and medial sides was assessed using a F-test.  P 
values of <0.05 were considered significant.  
RESULTS
 Significant differences in lateral and medial force and 
pressure differentials were seen in most scenarios despite 
clinically normal patellar tracking (Figures 1 and 2).   
     For the native knee (NKNP), a statistically significant 
difference was seen between the lateral and medial 
patellofemoral maximum force means (p=0.04) at a ratio 
between the lateral and medial sides of 1.63:1 with a trend 
(p=0.11) in the ratio of lateral to medial peak pressure (1.80:1).  
For RKNP scenario, an increase in the ratio of lateral to medial 
maximum force and peak pressure means was seen to 2.86:1 and 
1.99:1 which was significant (p<0.01 and p=0.04).      
     For the resurfaced knee and resurfaced patella scenario 
(RKRP), statistically significant differences were seen in lateral 
to medial maximum force means and peak pressure means 
(p<0.01 and p<0.01) at the ratios of 2.75:1 and 2.57:1.  The 
addition of a lateral release in this scenario (RKRP-LR) reduced 
the lateral to medial ratios of maximum force and peak pressure 
means to insignificant ratios (1.46:1 and 1.11:1, respectively). 
     For the gender-specific knee (GKRP), a statistically 
significant difference was seen in lateral to medial maximum 
force means (p<0.01) at the ratio of 1.96:1, but not in the lateral 
to medial peak pressure means (1.33:1).  Addition of a lateral 
release to the gender-specific knees did not significantly alter 
the ratios of lateral to medial differentials.

DISCUSSION 
     Ratios of peak pressure and maximum force were increased 
in the lateral patellofemoral compartment on resurfaced knees 
which were not seen in gender knees.  RKRP-LR and GKRP 
demonstrated lateral to medial patellofemoral force and pressure 
ratios most similar to the native patella (NKNP).   
     The addition of a lateral release in conventional total knee 
arthroplasty can equalize the medial-lateral force distributions.  
    The decreasing lateral to medial maximum force and peak 
pressure ratios in the lateral release group (RKRP-LR) after 
TKA and with gender-specific knees (GKRP) compared to the 
standard TKA (RKRP) demonstrates that these ratios are 
surrogate markers for patella tracking due to the known effects 
of lateral retinacular release on patella tracking and the design of 
gender-specific knees to improve tracking.   
    Intraoperative quantification of force and pressure 
differentials would enable the surgeon to assess proper patellar 
tracking, giving guidance for using lateral retinacular releases.

INTRODUCTION 
 
High plantar peak pressure values (PP) in people 
with diabetic polyneuropathy are correlated with 
ulceration (Boulton, 1983). An additional parameter 
that is commonly used to asses loading of the foot is 
the Pressure Time Integral (PTI) (Sauseng, 1999). 
However, a recent study (Waaijman, 2009) found high 
correlations between PP and PTI; and suggested that 
PTI would be of limited additional value.   
 
Novel software calculates PTI as the product of 
contact time with PP in one mask (PTI_novel) instead 
of using pressure per sample. This is expected to give 
an overestimation of the true PTI. The Force Time 
Integral (FTI) is calculated using individual sensor 
pressures per sample. Therefore, a more accurate 
approach to obtain PTI per mask is dividing FTI by 
contact area (PTI_F).  
 
We sought to test the differences between these 
two calculation methods in different populations with 
and without diabetes and diabetic polyneuropathy. 
METHODS
 
Subjects were divided in a group of healthy 
elderly (HE), a group with diabetes type 2 (DM), and a 
group with diabetes and polyneuropathy (DPN). 
Subjects were asked to walk barefooted over a 
pressure platform at standardized walking speed 
(1.2±0.1m/s).  
Table 1: Subject Characteristics. (mean±std. Error). 
 
Data was masked using the Novel 10 mask 
division (1=heel, 2=mid foot, 3-7=metatarsal region, 
8= hallux, 9-10= toes).  
RESULTS
 
 Overall PTI values were lower for PTI_F 
compared to PTI_novel (PTI_novel= 9.1±5.4 Ns/cm2,
PTI_F= 2.6±1.1 Ns/cm2). PP and PTI_novel showed a 
similarity of pattern, but PTI_F pattern differed from 
PTI_novel, especially in the region of the hallux. 
Figure 1 shows these differences for the DPN group. 
To operationalize the difference between both PTI 
calculations, PTI of the hallux was divided by PTI of 
the heel. These ratios differed significantly (p=0.000) 
between both calculations in each group (PTI_novel - 
PTI_F: HE 1.17 - 0.81; DM 1.34 - 0.79; DPN 1.19 - 
0.80).

DISCUSSION 
 
These results show that there is a difference in 
PTI calculation based on PP and FTI, especially in the 
hallux. Because the PTI_novel is based on PP, the 
additional value as described by Waaijman et al. 
(2009) may be limited.  
 
In addition, when comparing groups, there is a 
similarity of differences between PP and PTI_novel 
(not shown here). However, the differences between 
PP and PTI_F show an inconsistency when comparing 
the different groups per mask.  
 
Based on these results it is concluded that the 
more accurate calculation, as suggested here, may 
contribute to better understand foot sole loading.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In the field of foot biomechanics, the clinical 
relevance of the integration of pressure, kinematics 
and 
force 
measurements 
has 
already 
been 
demonstrated (Giacomozzi, 2000). Previous work 
conducted by the authors in this field has been focused 
on two key areas: First, to produce a reliable 
combination of pressure instrumentation, a kinematic 
foot model (in this case the Oxford Foot Model 
(OFM) (Stebbins, 2006), procedures and software to 
provide automated masks for accurate pathologic 
footprint selection. Second to identify the most 
appropriate geometrical footprint selections which, in 
presence of regular footprints, compares reliably to a 
selection based on markers from the OFM.  Since 
kinematic measurements are not always available, it is 
useful to know which geometric mask should be used 
to allow comparable results. The present study deals 
with this latter aim. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Markers from the OFM were used to define the 
following 5 anatomically-based foot areas (Stebbins, 
2006): 1) medial hindfoot (MH); 2) lateral hindfoot 
(LH); 3) midfoot (MI); 4) medial forefoot, toes 
included (MF); 5) lateral forefoot, toes included (LF). 
novel gmbh purposely modified the multimask 
software to integrate kinematic data from a VICON 
system acquired simultaneously with an emed pressure 
platform. As a result, the above areas were identified 
by vertically projecting the position of the relevant 
anatomical markers at midstance. Two automated 
masks (available in software) were found to be the 
most similar to the OFM based mask: i) BIS mask, 
based on the longitudinal bisecting line of the foot and 
on the two lines perpendicular to it placed at default 
distances from the bottom of the footprint (27% and 
55% respectively); ii) HT2 mask: similar to the BIS 
mask, but based on the longitudinal line going from 
the middle of the hindfoot to 2nd toe (HT2 line). Since 
the 
OFM-based 
selection 
uses 
two 
different 
longitudinal axes for the hindfoot and the forefoot, 
two further geometrical masks were created based on a 
mixed use of the previous two masks: i) MIX: same 
hindfoot selection as BIS, same forefoot as HT2; ii) 
MIX1: same hindfoot as HT2, same forefoot as BIS. 
Thus, 5 masks were applied in all to 200 footprints 
acquired from a young healthy population of 19 girls 
and boys (38 feet). Up to now, 25 different, randomly 
selected footprints have been processed. %RMSEs 
were calculated along the whole loading process for 
vertical force (F), contact area (A), peak pressure (PP) 
and mean pressure (MP).  
 
RESULTS
 
Very good matching was found in all the 4 
geometric masks with the OFM-based mask – 
RMSE<5% for F, A and PP; RMSE§6% for MP. BIS 
and MIX1 showed better results than HT2 and MIX, 
MIX1 giving the best results. MF was the most 
sensitive area as for F; MI was the most sensitive as 
for A, PP and MP. Table 1 reports the %RMSEs for 
MIX1 mask. Fig.1 shows the 5 masks on a regular 
footprint and the corresponding %RMSE averaged 
over F, A, PP and MP.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The bones of the foot are largely supported by 
the soft tissue on the plantar surface, which acts as the 
interface with the ground (Tachdjian, 1985). Soft 
tissue stiffness could affect pressure distribution, 
shock absorption, or stability during gait. Assessment 
of soft tissue is important for foot structures that may 
be prone to increased stiffness such as in high arch 
structures that are commonly more rigid and less 
adaptable to the ground for impact cushioning (Van 
Boerum, 2003). Even though plantar stiffness has been 
evaluated using a variety of methods, there are no 
standardized methods to measure plantar stiffness that 
take into account the real-time, dynamic, weight 
bearing condition of stance phase of gait (Cavanaugh, 
1999 & Rome, 2000). Therefore, we hypothesize that 
this technique will be able to describe the changes in 
plantar stiffness during stance based on differences in 
arch structures. 
METHODS
Reflective markers were placed on the feet of 13 
subjects (age range 18-21) with no foot pathologies. 
Trajectory data were collected with Vicon motion 
capture cameras during sitting trials and while walking 
over a Novel EMED-ST/E pedobarograph (Munich, 
Germany). To model the stiffness of the soft tissue, 
force and deformation had to be isolated. The 
deformation was the difference in distance between 
the markers on the foot and the ground during sitting 
unloaded trials and during walking. Deformation data 
were limited to the time each segment were in contact 
with the ground and decimated due differences in 
collection frequencies. Force data for each segment 
were matched to the corresponding deformation data, 
and all data were inputted into the equation for a 
simple spring to model stiffness.
RESULTS
 
When compared to the low arch subjects, the 
mean stiffness values for the high arched subjects 
were greatest in the heel and lowest in the hallux 
(Table 1). The real time stiffness plots show the 
changing stiffness during the weight bearing condition 
of stance phase (Figure 1).

CONCLUSION 
 
This work demonstrates the feasibility and utility 
of combining motion capture data with pedobarograph 
data to characterize plantar stiffness during stance for 
comparison between arch structures.  Variations in 
plantar stiffness during loading and unloading could 
impact foot function and alter gait patterns, and 
therefore should be examined more thoroughly.

BACKGROUND 
 
Static measurements of foot structure have 
previously been used in both the clinical and research 
setting to describe and classify foot structure 
(Redmond, 2008). Attempts have been made to relate 
these different classifications to lower extremity 
injuries and to identify appropriate athletic footwear in 
an attempt to mitigate injury (Jenkins, 2007; Knapik, 
2010). Such attempts, however, have yet to yield 
consistent results (Barnes, 2008; Burns, 2005). Since 
the foot is dynamically loaded during gait and sport 
activities, it may be more appropriate to classify foot 
structure based on dynamic geometric variables. Prior 
to this application, the reliability of these variables 
must be established. The purpose of this study was to 
determine the reliability of geometric variables 
obtained during gait at a self-selected speed.  
METHODS
 
Ten healthy males (n=8) and females (n=2) 
participated in this study (age: 27.7 ± 4.1 years, mass: 
77.6 ± 10.7 kg, height: 174.3 ± 7.0 cm). Data were 
collected on two different days using the EMED-X®
system (Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany), with a 
sampling frequency of 100Hz. A two-step approach at 
a self-selected speed was utilized for all trials, which 
previously has been demonstrated to be reliable in gait 
analysis (McPoil, 1999). In order for a trial to be 
included the following criteria were met: only one foot 
contacted the platform, contact was made on the 
second step, subjects did not “target” the platform, and 
subjects appeared to walk with their normal gait and 
cadence. After familiarization of the task, subjects 
performed 5 right and 5 left trials. 
 
Geometric variables were then obtained through 
the Novel software package. Intraclass correlation 
coefficients (ICC) were calculated using a two-way 
random effects model (ICC [2, k]) and means and 
standard errors were calculated for each foot for 21 
geometric variables. 
RESULTS
 
Means, standard errors of the measurement 
(SEMs), and ICCs for both the left and right feet are 
presented in Table 1. Excellent reliability (ICC>0.90) 
was demonstrated in 15 of the 21 geometric variables 
for the left foot and 16 of the 21 variables for the right 
foot. Good reliability (ICC>0.70) was demonstrated in 
20 of the 21 variable for both the left and right feet.

INTRODUCTION 
Alpine skiing has been characterized as 
particularly dangerous to the knee joint (Heir et al., 
2005). Many of these may be avoidable with a greater 
understanding of biomechanical parameters related to 
skiing technique and equipment design. Attempts to 
measure the dynamic forces transferred to the skier 
have been described previously. Only few have 
successfully realized a full six degree-of-freedom 
measurement system due to the high technical 
challenges 
implied 
(Kiefmann 
et 
al., 
2006). 
Alternatively, pressure insole systems have been used 
to collect data during skiing with different applications 
and studies (Schaff et al., 1989). 
The purpose of this investigation was to 
compare a pressure insole in combination with a 
pressure sensor placed inside the shaft at the anterior 
aspect of the tibia to the data collected from a full six 
degree-of-freedom force sensor mounted between 
shoe and binding. It was hypothesized that vertical 
reaction forces and the moment about the ankle joint 
can be estimated from pressure measurements. 
METHODS
 
Tests were carried out on two occasions on 
slopes of appr. 20° inclination. One subject performed 
various reference movements and relevant skiing 
motions including straight runs, short and long turns 
on a groomed slope. Secondly, six subjects performed 
runs on a mogul course. Skill levels ranged from 
advanced to elite. Two mobile 6 DoF force plates were 
mounted between ski boot and binding sampling to a 
biovision mini computer (500 Hz). A Pedar insole 
system (novel GmbH) consisting of an insole and a 
dorsal pad, sampling at 125 Hz was worn inside one of 
the boots. A synchronized video was recorded for all 
trials.  
RESULTS
 
During both, the reference trials as well as skiing 
on the slope and moguls, anterior shaft contact forces 
of over 80% body weight were recorded. During 
single legged turns this was up to 100% body weight 
indicating a substantial load being transferred through 
the shaft of modern ski boots. For a relatively upright 
posture vertical forces of up to 80% of the reading of 
the force sensor were registered by the plantar insole.  
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Results indicate a highly complex interaction 
between movement at the ankle joint, positioning of 
the body with respect to the ski and the transfer of 
loads through the boot-shaft system. It was thus not 
possible to get a reasonable representation of the 
vertical force by the pressure system. The combination 
of shaft and plantar pressure readings was used to 
estimate the anterior-posterior moment between leg 
and ski. In some relatively static riding situation the 
two systems were reasonably similar. It is thus 
indicated that the use of pressure inside a ski boot is 
not sufficient for characterizing the loads experienced 
by the body system during alpine skiing. However, for 
the assessment of boot fit, balancing tasks or 
biofeedback studies the use of pressure insoles will be 
valuable. Further, it might be possible to improve the 
pressure system setup by covering more area of the 
foot- and shank-boot interface. More studies are 
required to explore these relationships.

INTRODUCTION 
 
It is widely believed that plantar pressure data is 
susceptible to a large degree of intra- and inter-subject 
variability.  This reduces confidence in interpreting 
results, particularly following clinical intervention.  
There are now a range of pressure platforms available 
for collecting data, utilising a broad spectrum of 
technology.  Along with this, there is currently a lack 
of standardization in methodology for collecting 
plantar pressure data, and reporting of results.     
 
It is unclear how much of the variability reported 
in plantar pressure measurement is due to varying 
methods of data collection and instrumentation, and 
how much is attributable to real variation in the data. 
 
The aim of this study was to determine the 
amount of variability in plantar pressure assessment 
that is due to differences in the types of equipment 
used to collect the data.  This was achieved by using a 
standardised protocol, and comparing the results and 
the intra- and inter-subject variability from two 
different pressure platforms. 
METHODS
 
A Novel Emed-M capacitive pressure platform 
was used to collect data from 19 healthy children (age 
range 6 – 16 years).  In addition, a prototype, piezo-
resistive pressure platform (ISS), rigidly mounted to 
an AMTI force plate, was used to collect data from a 
different group of 15 healthy children (age range 6 – 
16 years).  Three footprints were collected from each 
foot.  Both pressure platforms had a spatial resolution 
of 4 sensors per square cm, and collected data at 50Hz. 
A 12 camera, Vicon (Vicon, Oxford) system was used 
to collect synchronous data from markers placed on 
the feet, according to the Oxford Foot Model protocol 
(Stebbins, 2006).  Co-ordinates from anatomical 
marker positions were projected onto the overall 
pressure map at a time corresponding to mid-stance, 
and used to automatically divide the footprint into five 
areas (medial heel, lateral heel, midfoot, medial 
forefoot, lateral forefoot) using a previously validated 
protocol (Giacomozzi, 2000).   The peak force and 
peak pressure for each sub-area were compared 
between platforms, along with the intra-subject 
standard deviations.  
RESULTS
 
Difference in the average peak force (normalized 
to body weight) obtained from each platform were 
minimal (Figure 1), (0.1-1.3 N/kg).  Differences in 
peak pressure were slightly higher, with the least 
difference in the lateral forefoot (27kPa) and the most 
in the medial forefoot (157kPa).  Differences in the 
intra-subject standard deviations were negligible in the 
peak force comparison (0.1-0.8N/kg).  Differences in 
the peak pressure intra-subject standard deviations 
were much higher (16-98kPa).  The co-efficient of 
variation for peak pressure was consistently lower for  
Emed.  The lower accuracy of ISS was partially 
compensated for by instantaneously calibrating it with 
information from the force platform; this led to 
comparable peak force data, but little improvement 
was obtained for the accuracy of the pressure 
measurements. These results suggest that comparable 
data can be obtained from 2 different pressure 
platforms when the methodology is stanadardised, 
however accuracy of the pressure platform is critical.

PURPOSE
 
While it has been proposed that motion control 
or stability running shoes are designed to control foot 
pronation, little research has been published to 
substantiate this claim.  Cheung et al (2008) reported 
that motion control shoes, in comparison to neutral 
shoes, reduced midfoot forces during running but 
failed to consider contact area acting on the midfoot 
while walking. We hypothesized that the amount of 
midfoot contact area, indicative of medial and lateral 
longitudinal arch sagittal plane movement, would not 
increase between walking and running if a motion 
control shoe was effective in controlling foot mobility.  
The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
change in plantar surface contact area when walking 
and running in motion control shoes. 
SUBJECTS 
 
Ten females’ subjects with a mean age of 25.5 
years (range 22 to 34 years) with no history of 
congenital or traumatic deformity or foot problems 
volunteered to participate in study.  All subjects ran at 
least 15 miles per week for the past 2 years and were 
fitted with new motion control shoes (Brooks Ravenna 
Stability) at the same local running footwear store.  
METHODS
 
Foot measurements previously described were 
recorded in weight bearing so that the arch height ratio 
(AHR), foot mobility magnitude (FMM) and foot 
posture index (FPI) could be calculated for all subjects 
(McPoil et al, 2009).  The FPI and AHR were used to 
determine foot posture with the FMM used to 
determine foot mobility.  Each subject was asked to 
walk and run in their running shoes over a 42-meter 
indoor runway while in-shoe pressure data were 
collected using the PEDAR-X system.  To determine 
the effect of the shoe contour on plantar surface area, 
each subject was asked to walk over the same distance 
while pressure data were collected while wearing a flat 
soled, non-contoured karate shoe.  For all in-shoe 
pressure measurements, the sensor insoles were place 
over a flat piece of firm insole material (durometer = 
58 Shore A) that replaced the original shoe sockliner.  
Ten consecutive steps from the middle 20 meters for 
the right foot only were selected for analysis.  Novel 
percent mask and group mask software was used to 
determine contact area in the following plantar 
regions: medial heel, lateral heel, medial midfoot, 
lateral midfoot, medial forefoot, lateral forefoot, and 
hallux.  A MANOVA was used to determine those 
plantar surface areas that were significantly difference.  
Based on those results, an ANOVA and Tukey’s 
pairwise comparisons were used to further assess the 
medial and lateral midfoot regions. 
Figure 1: MANOVA results for plantar contact area  
(1 = karate shoe, 2 = walk in shoe; 3 = run in shoe).  
RESULTS
 
The mean values for foot posture and mobility 
were: AHR = 0.335+0.018; FMM = 1.58+0.27; and 
FPI = 3.8 + 2.35.  Based on these measures only one 
subject was classified as excessively pronated. 
 
Total plantar contact area was significantly 
increased in the medial midfoot (p < .0001) when 
running in the shoe in comparison to both walking 
conditions (shoe & karate).  The mean surface area for 
the medial midfoot was 4.4 cm2 for karate walk, 7.4 
cm2 for shoe walk, and 22.1 cm2 for shoe run. Total 
plantar contact area was also significantly increased in 
the lateral midfoot (p < .0001) when running in the 
shoe in comparison to both walking conditions (shoe 
& karate).  The mean surface area for the lateral 
midfoot was 17.7 cm2 for karate walk, 24.3 cm2 for 
shoe walk, and 29.6 cm2 for shoe run.  
CONCLUSION 
 
The results indicate that motion control shoes, 
designed with a duo-density midsole and a firm heel 
counter, cannot prevent increased movement of the 
medial and lateral midfoot when running.  This would 
suggest that sagittal plane movement of the midfoot is 
occurring within the motion control shoe while 
running.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Plantar loading patterns have been shown to 
differ among cleat styles during complex sport   
maneuvers (Orendurff et al. 2008). The choice of 
footwear style, however, is often based on individual 
perceived ratings. The quantification of plantar 
loading patterns may help explain perceived footwear 
ratings during sports. The purpose of this study was to 
identify the relationship between foot loading patterns 
and perceived footwear rating.  
METHODS
 
Seventeen male football players participated in 
the data collection (age: 16.9±0.9 years; height: 
181.4±5.5 cm; mass: 79.8±10.9 kg). Each athlete was 
fitted with a new model of a noncleated turf American 
football training shoe (Nike Astrograbber). A flexible 
in-shoe pressure distribution measuring insole (Pedar, 
Novel) was inserted into the right shoe and sampled at 
99Hz. Athletes ran a slalom course, modified from 
Eils et al. (2004), on a synthetic turf field with rubber 
infill. Nine side-cut steps were collected and analyzed 
with separate masks (medial and lateral heel, medial 
and lateral midfoot, medial, central and lateral 
forefoot, hallux, and the lesser toes). The force time 
integral in each individual region was divided by the 
force time integral for the total plantar foot surface in 
order to determine the relative load in each region. 
 
Following the cutting trials, the athletes’ 
perception of the footwear was assessed via visual 
analog scale (VAS) where 0mm = none/worst and 100 
mm = complete/best. Categories included comfort, 
control, stability, traction, and safety. Athletes were 
also questioned whether they felt comfortable wearing 
and performing in the shoe at full intensity. One-way 
ANOVA was used to compare relative load and peak 
pressure between subjects that would wear (WW, 
n=11) and would not wear (NW, n=6) the noncleated 
shoe used during testing. Correlation coefficients were 
used to compare the relationship between pressure 
distribution and VAS.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
NW had increased relative loading in the lateral 
midfoot (p=0.002) and lateral forefoot (p=0.045) 
compared to WW. Peak pressure was significantly 
decreased in NW compared to WW at the medial 
forefoot (p=0.029). Increased lateral forefoot relative 
load significantly correlated to lower perceived ratings 
in control (r=-0.72), stability (r=-0.73), traction (r=-
0.60) and safety (r=-0.66) (Figure 1). The perceived 
rating of comfort was not significantly correlated with 
relative load or peak pressure measures.   
Figure 1: Relationship between visual analog scale 
and lateral forefoot relative load. 
 
The differences in medial and lateral loading 
between groups likely relate to decreased stability and 
control during the cutting. The subset of athletes that 
did not feel comfortable performing in the noncleated 
footwear (NW) may have been accustomed to cleated 
footwear which led to greater lateral loading. Medial 
and lateral loading patterns have been found to differ 
with foot type (Queen et al. 2009). Additional 
investigation into the effects of foot type on perceived 
footwear rating and plantar loading are warranted.

INTRODUCTION  
 
The crossover toe deformity refers to an unstable 
second metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) that leads to 
a progressive migration of the second toe in a dorsal 
and medial direction (Coughlin, 1993). The etiology is 
uncertain, but as summarized elsewhere (Kaz, 2007), 
it has been proposed that a long second metatarsal 
causes abnormal loading (i.e. increased plantar 
pressure) beneath the second MTPJ during stance 
phase. Over time, this causes MTPJ pain, agitation, 
medial collateral and lateral collateral ligament 
rupture, and toe migration. In the current study, we 
used a robotic gait simulator (RGS), cadaveric 
specimens and a surgical metatarsal lengthening 
process to further investigate this relationship. We 
hypothesized that lengthening of the second metatarsal 
would increase plantar pressure beneath the second 
MTPJ and reduce the peak pressure underneath the 
first metatarsal head. 
METHODS
 
Dissection, 
including 
mid-tibia 
transection, 
exposure of the second metatarsal dorsally, and 
separation of nine extrinsic foot tendons, was 
performed for six specimens. Elongation of the second 
metatarsal was achieved through transection, a 
custom-made 
aluminum 
support 
bracket, 
and 
aluminum spacers of varying lengths (control, 2mm, 
4mm, 6mm, 8mm). A robotic gait simulator (RGS) 
simulated physiologic tibial motion, tendon loading, 
and ground reaction forces (GRF) on the cadaveric 
feet. Stance phase was scaled to 10 seconds and the 
vertical GRF to half body weight. The GRF was 
measured with a force plate mounted to the RGS, and 
a Novel emed-sf pressure plate was mounted in series 
with the force plate. Custom pressure masks were 
created from weight bearing radiographs of each foot 
and used to determine the peak pressure (PP) and 
pressure-time integral (PTI) under the first and second 
MTPJs during gait. Statistical analysis was performed 
with a linear mixed effects model.  
RESULTS
 
With increased spacer length, PP decreased 
under the first metatarsal head and increased under the 
second metatarsal head (Figure 1). Second metatarsal 
PP and PTI were positively correlated with an increase 
in second metatarsal length (p = .0005, p < .0001). 
First metatarsal PP and PTI were significantly 
negatively associated with second metatarsal length (p 
= .029, p = .024).   
    
 
Figure 1:

RGS; left: control spacer, right: 8mm spacer.   
DISCUSSION 
 
Our results support the hypothesis that second 
metatarsal length is positively associated with plantar 
pressure underneath the second MTPJ. Differing from 
the first MTPJ, the second MTPJ capsule and soft 
tissue structures are not designed to support the large 
stance phase loads. It is thought that prolonged 
exposure to the plantar pressures measured in our 
study would lead to the observed joint subluxation and 
dislocation seen in crossover toe patients. Overall, 
these findings give a better understanding of the 
mechanisms responsible for the development of the 
deformity as well as clarify controversial associations 
of the deformity found in the literature.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Chronic ulnar nerve compression is believed to 
be a primary cause of sensory and motor impairments 
of the hand, which is common among cyclists. 
Prevention techniques include frequently changing 
hand position and wearing padded gloves.  However 
to date, there has been no scientific examination into 
the effectiveness of these measures (Kennedy, 2008).  
 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
effects of hand position and glove padding on pressure 
over the ulnar nerve. Specifically, we considered three 
hand positions commonly used on road bicycles. We 
also compared gloves with either 3 mm or 5 mm gel or 
foam padding placed over the hypothenar eminence, 
thenar eminence and metacarpal heads. 
METHODS
 
Thirty-six healthy adults (18 male, 18 female) 
were tested (38.9±13 yrs, 74.2±13.9 kg and 174±9cm). 
A stationary cycle was adjusted to match the 
dimensions of each subject’s personal road bicycle. 
Subjects performed a series of trials in which hand 
position (Fig 1) and glove type were randomly varied 
while power and cadence levels were kept consistent.  
A pressure sensitive mat (229 sensors, Elastisens - 
FO44, Novel GmbH) was used to record pressure 
distribution over the hypothenar region of the hand. 
This region is where the ulnar nerve enters the hand 
through Guyon’s Canal and is most susceptible to 
external compression (Black, 2007). Pressure from 12 
consecutive pedal strokes were averaged to quantify 
both the pressure distribution and peak pressure over 
the hypothenar region.  
 
Three-dimensional images of the subject’s hand 
with and without the pressure mat were obtained using 
a laser scanner (Shape-Grabber Inc). These laser scans 
were registered with subject-specific pressure images 
to relate pressure profiles to the underlying anatomy 
(Fig 1). The compressive stiffness of the foam and gel 
padding was measured separately with a materials 
testing machine and a 15 mm diameter indenter.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Padding in the hypothenar region of the glove 
reduced peak pressures found in the no glove 
condition from 21-28%, with the highest pressure 
reduction achieved using 3 mm of foam. The foam 
padding/glove system was found to be ~50% less stiff 
than the gel, suggesting that better pressure reduction 
was achieved using a more compliant interface. 
Absolute pressure magnitudes were greatest with the 
hands in the drops position (128-168 kPa), which were 
significantly greater (p < 0.05) than those found in the 
tops and hoods positions. Pressure magnitudes did not 
significantly vary between male and female cyclists.  
 
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has 
measured high-resolution pressure distributions on 
cyclist’s hands while riding. The data obtained is 
important for establishing a quantitative, scientific 
approach to design interventions aimed at reducing the 
prevalence of hand impairments in cyclists.

Canal were observed with the hands in the drops and 
hoods positions.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Consider the scoring system in golf. On each 
hole, playing to “par” allows the golfer two putts per 
hole – a total of 36 putts over an 18-hole round, or 
about half the total number of shots allocated for par. 
Considering that players have 13 other clubs in their 
bag, and would tend to use most of them at some 
stage, the putter is the most often used piece of 
equipment that a player possesses. Whilst this 
simplistic logic may be an exaggeration for the elite 
golfer, data indicates that even at the elite level, 
around 38% of all strokes are putts (2009 PGA Tour 
data, www.pgatour.com)  
Research into putting performance follows 
the same common theme - players are separated into 
groups based on handicap level. The question of 
interest seemingly “how do the elite/expert/low 
handicap golfers compare to the novice/high handicap 
golfers?” 
All 
authors 
assumed 
that 
putting 
performance was related to handicap level. On putting 
performance alone this was not definitively supported. 
Also, the authors often analysed only putts that were 
successful - that is putts that went in the hole 
(Paradisis and Rees, n.d.) or stopped over the target 
(Delay et al., 1997; Haltom, 1994; Zafiroglu, 1994). 
However, these types of studies do not investigate 
technique differences. In contrast, Pelz (2000) points 
out that there have been many different putting 
techniques used by professionals over the years. 
 
The aim of the present study was to define if 
more than one putting technique truly exists in a 
sample of golfers of different handicap levels. 
METHODOLOGY 
A total of 38 players participated in the 
testing sessions. These players were members of a 
private suburban golf club in Melbourne and all were 
experienced golfers. The average age of the sample 
was 55.3 (±17.8) years and average handicap 15.3 
(±6.9).
Simultaneous video (50Hx perpendicular to 
line of putt) and pressure data (16 x 16 pliance® 
pressure mat, 50Hz, novel, Germany) were collected 
for each putt. The data collection process required 
each player to putt whilst standing on the pressure mat 
which was positioned on the practice putting green. 
Each participant completed five putts at a hole cut into 
the green 4m (13ft) away.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Combining the kinematic, temporal and COP 
data, 62 parameters were available for analysis. 
Players were not divided according to handicap, 
putting trials were analysed individually and all data 
entered into cluster analysis methods to define putting 
techniques. This allowed the creation of technique 
based on the movements exhibited by players during 
the putting stroke.  
 
For cluster analysis, the most influential 
parameters in determining cluster membership were 
related to movement of the COP in the medio-lateral 
direction (COPx), namely: range of movement of 
COPx in the backswing; range of movement of COPx 
in the downswing; maximum velocity of COPx in the 
downswing and velocity of COPx at the time of ball 
contact (this was the most influential parameter). 
Two distinct putting techniques were identified 
by cluster analysis:  
1. 
Less movement (relative to cluster 2) of COPx 
in the backswing and downswing phases with 
velocity of COPx at ball contact closer to zero 
(on average). Low COPx velocity. 
2.  
Larger movement (relative to cluster 1) of COPx 
in the backswing and downswing phases with 
velocity of COPx at ball contact non-zero. High 
COPx velocity. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Analysis of COP data is able to distinguish 
putting techniques in an amateur group of golfers. 
Cluster 
analysis 
methods 
allow 
performance 
techniques to be distinguished based on parameters 
related to execution of the skill, rather than handicap.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Patients with poor blood circulation carry the 
risk of decubitus since it is generally unavoidable to 
use various bed positions in order to treat patients. 
Several mattresses have been introduced in order to 
prevent decubitus caused as such. However, since 
there are diverse kinds of them and many different 
methods to use them, patients’ families and nurses 
experience many difficulties in selecting and using 
mattresses for prevention of decubitus. Therefore, in 
this study, the effects of diverse mattresses for 
prevention of decubitus,  bed positions and subjects’ 
body mass index (BMI) on contact pressures in the 
areas such as the scapula, the hip and the feet- heels 
was quantitatively measured, analyzed and compared 
with each other.  
METHODS
 
Experiments were conducted on normal persons 
with under-, normal-, and over-weight (5males/ group) 
who were free of vascular system diseases. In this 
study, a general mattress and four types of mattresses 
for prevention of decubitus (latex, bubble, alternative, 
and air mattress) were largely used and five different 
bed positions were defined as experimental conditions 
using three-step electromotive beds. (Figure 1) To 
measure contact pressures, a order-made pressure 
measuring system (bedsize, Pliance FTX, v12.1.36, 
Novel Gmbh) was used. The mattress and the pressure 
sensor were stabilized for around 30 minutes and an 
additional process for stabilization for 30 minutes was 
included after the subject was laid on the mattress 
before the experiment in order to minimize the contact 
pressure measurement errors caused by air movements 
in the mattress. The same processes were repeated for 
five different bed positions. Maximum peak pressure 
(MPP) was separately measured using the predefined 
mask on supine body areas.

RESULTS
 
In the case of flat positions, the result indicated 
that only the bubble mattress was acceptable to the 
subject with normal body weight, latex or air mattress 
to the over-weighted subject and only air mattress to 
the low-weighted subject.  In the case of the subject 
with normal body weight for 30o position in the head 
area, MPP lower than the reference value were 
measured in all the mattresses except for latex and 
bubble mattress and in the case of the over-weighted 
subject, all mattresses were usable except for general 
mattresses, alternatives, and bubble mattresses but in 
the case of the under-weighted subject, all the 
mattresses showed MPP higher than the reference 
value. In the case of 60o position in the head area, only 
the latex mattress was acceptable to the subject with 
normal body weight while all the mattresses showed 
MPP higher than the reference value in the case of 
both the over-weighted subject and the under-
weighted subject. In the case of 30° positions in the 
head area in the leg area respectively, it was indicated 
that only general mattress and alternative mattresses 
were acceptable to the subject with normal body 
weight while only general mattresses, latex, and air 
mattresses were acceptable to the over-weighted 
subject. In the case of the low-weighted subject, latex, 
alternative, and air mattress showed MPP lower than 
the reference value. Lastly for side position, all the 
mattresses showed results exceeding the reference 
value in the case of the subject with normal body 
weight and the over-weighted subject while it was 
indicated that alternative and air mattresses were 
acceptable to the over-weighted subject.

CONCLUSION 
 
Air mattresses showed generally even effects to 
prevent decubitus across all the bed positions followed 
by latex mattresses. It was indicated that decisions to 
use bubble or alternative mattresses for prevention of 
decubitus should be made more carefully.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Polliack et al. (2000) pointed out that measuring 
pressure between the prosthetic socket and residual 
limb could provide valuable information for the 
process of socket fabrication, modification, and fit. 
Previous studies have investigated how interface 
pressure distributions change as a result of prosthetic 
alignment 
(Seelen, 
2003), 
adaptable 
ankle-foot 
components (Wolf, 2009), and walking surfaces such 
as ramps and stairs (Wolf, 2009 and Dou, 2006). 
Prosthetic liners may improve comfort by more evenly 
distributing pressure at the residual limb (Boutwell, 
2009). It is also likely that changes in liner thickness 
will affect interface pressure. Therefore, the purpose 
of this study is to examine the effects of gel liner 
thickness (3mm and 9mm) on residual limb pressures.  
METHODS
 
Eleven subjects with unilateral trans-tibial 
amputations agreed to participate in the study and 
signed IRB-approved consent forms. Mean age of the 
subjects was 56 ± 9 years with at least 6 months 
experience using a prosthesis and all were able to walk 
without undue fatigue. Two Alpha prosthetic gel 
(thermoplastic elastomer) liners (Ohio Willow Wood, 
Mt. Sterling, OH) were tested. Sockets for both gel 
liners were made for each subject using a CAM 
system called Squirt Shape (Rolock, 2000) that was 
developed in our laboratory. All other prosthetic 
components were the same for each subject. The same 
certified prosthetist fit and aligned the socket to each 
subject. Subjects were given an accommodation 
period of at least two weeks on each prosthesis prior to 
testing. A gait analysis was performed with the person 
walking at his normal self-selected speed for each 
liner condition. Mean walking speed across all 
subjects and all conditions was 1.14 ± 0.14 m/sec.  
 
Prior to each gait evaluation, 6cm X 3cm 
pressure sensors (Pliance, Novel Electronics, Inc.) 
were placed over the patellar tendon (PT) region, the 
anterior distal tibia (DT), and the fibular head (FH). 
Pressure data were synchronized with the motion data 
to calculate gait cycles and recorded at 120 Hz.  
RESULTS
Data from nine of the subjects were analyzed due 
to incomplete data sets from two subjects. Peak 
pressure values averaged over multiple gait cycles for 
each sensor matrix were calculated. Peak values 
during the first 40 percent of the gait cycle and the 
second 40 percent of the gait cycle were recorded and 
compared between the 3mm and the 9mm liners 
(Table 1). A nonparametric Wilcoxon signed ranks 
test with a Bonferroni correction was used to 
determine any significant median differences between 
the peak pressure values for each sensor matrix. No 
significant differences were found between liners.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Median peak pressure values were reduced for 
both peaks over the PT and the FH with the thicker 
liner, although the small sample size may have 
contributed to the lack of statistical differences 
between the two liners. The DT peak pressure increase 
may indicate that thicker gel liners provide a different 
pressure distribution pattern.  Patient preference 
should be considered when determining liner 
thickness.

INTRODUCTION 
An understanding of the force and impulse 
acting on the key by the finger associated to the sound 
generated is important because it makes the difference 
between interpretation and pure mechanical played 
notes. Some studies have been made in order to 
determine the force applied on the key and the relation 
with the level of loudness and the type of finger touch 
(Harding  1989, Kinoshita 2007, Parlitz 1998), 
providing important informations in relation to  piano
(p), mezzo forte (mf), and fortissimo (f f) levels with 
staccato  and legato touch. In the present study, using 
pressure sensors applied on the key surface, we made 
an analysis of the relationship between the force-time 
characteristics and the performance of pianists playing 
passages of classical music. 
METHODS
 
Fifteen pianists (8 female and 6 male) with 
different level of expertise (from IP: winning 
international prices to TL: top level ) played the first 2 
measures of Schubert’s Wanderer Phantasie (4 times 
in ff and 4 times in pp) on a grand piano (Bechstein). 
They were asked to play with theirs best interpretation 
and constancy; the finger sequences (fingering) were 
identical for all subjects. Five pressure sensors 
(S2013, 20x45 mm2, <1,2 mm, 10-600 KPa, Pliance-
Novel) were attached to the most relevant keys and 
collected at 300 Hz. Video records were taken via 3 
Casio Cameras at 300 Hz for later 3-D analysis. Sound 
track was recorded via professional tools. 
RESULTS
 
Peak force and impulse were calculated for each 
sensor and for each repetition. TL subjects showed 
50% higher peak force in ff (9,6 N vs 6,4 N) but 
similar values in pp ( 2,7 N vs 2,6 N) compared to IP 
subjects. All pianists have a stable reproducibility of 
peak force as described by the coefficient of variation 
( CV 10%-20% for IP; CV 14%-27% for TL in ff and 
pp respectively).  
 
Indeed, very high differences were noted in the 
total impulses. Overall average values for TL subjects  
were 73% (0,91 Ns vs 0,24 Ns in ff) and 69% (0,33 1 
Ns vs 0,11 Ns in pp ) higher then for IP. Significant 
difference were also found in the CV of impulse 
structure (11%-18% for IP vs 33%-35% for TL).  
 
An 
efficiency 
index 
was 
calculated 
by 
computing the proportion of the impulse up to the 
peak force to the total impulse. This index reveals the 
capacity of the pianist to produce the desired loudness 
without exert unnecessary force. The relationship 
between this parameter and the number of touches 
played on each keys could reflect the stability of 
motor pattern and force sensibility of the pianist. Fig 1 
shows exemplary the difference of impulse efficiency 
between IP and TL pianist (sbj. 4 and sbj. 12). It easy 
to recognize that for almost all the strikes subject 4 
shows a significant better regulation of force 
production.

Moreover an analysis of possible relationships 
between the force produced during playing and the 
force capacity of the fingers was carried out by testing 
maximal voluntary contraction force of each finger 
under isometric controlled conditions.  
 
Sound characteristics were studied by acoustical 
analysis (Samplitude V7.0) and by a quality 
questionnaire administered to professional judges.

THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN RUNNING 
Daniel E. Lieberman (1) 
1. Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Massachusetts 
 
Ever since the human lineage diverged from the 
African apes, hominins have been bipeds of some 
sort.  Comparative and fossil evidence suggest that the 
earliest hominins were capable, habitual bipedal 
walkers but were also adept at climbing trees.  At 
some point, however, hominins lost the ability to 
climb trees very well, and became superlative long 
distance runners.  Comparisons of human endurance 
running performance with other mammals show that 
we excel at speed, distance, and the climatic context in 
which we can run. Further, human distance running 
capabilities far exceed those of any other primate, and 
they match or even surpass the best mammalian 
runners in hot conditions over very long distances. 
These capabilities raise several questions, among them 
when humans became long distance runners, why 
these abilities evolved, and how the evolutionary 
history of endurance running may help avoid injury. 
 
A review of the fossil evidence suggests that 
features which improve endurance running 
performance in humans first appear about 2 million 
years ago in the genus Homo, mostly in the species H. 
erectus (Bramble and Lieberman, 2004).  These 
features include changes in the foot (e.g., shortened 
toes and the development of a full longitudinal arch), 
the hip (e.g., expansion of the cranial portion of the 
gluteus maximus), and the head (e.g., enlargement of 
the anterior and posterior semicircular canals).  Many 
important adaptations for endurance running, 
however, are impossible to assess in the fossil record, 
and it is not known whether H. erectus was as capable 
a runner as modern humans. 
 
A review of the ethnographic and archaeological 
records suggests that the primary advantage of long 
distance running was for persistence hunting.  In this 
method of hunting, runners alternatively chase 
quadrupeds at a gallop speed, thus preventing them 
form panting, and track the animals (usually at a 
walk). Since quadrupeds cannot simultaneously pant 
and gallop, this form of hunting drives the animals 
into a state of hyperthermia making it easy to dispatch 
them without significant projectile technology, which 
was lacking until very recently in human evolution. 
 
Finally, studies of habitually barefoot runners 
indicate that the human foot, like the rest of the body, 
is well designed for endurance running.  People can 
run long distances at high speeds quite comfortably 
over very hard surfaces without using cushioned, high-
heeled shoes. A barefoot “style” of running typically 
involves a forefoot or midfoot strike, both of which 
generate no discernable impact transient because of 
increased limb compliance and less effective mass at 
the moment the foot collides with the ground 
(Lieberman et al., 2010).  This sort of light and gentle 
landing requires more calf and foot muscle strength, 
but generates less impact than heel-toe running in 
modern running shoes, and is presumably how humans 
ran for millions of years. Such insights raise the 
evolutionary medical hypothesis that more minimal 
shoes which foster a more natural, barefoot running 
style may have advantages over more cushioned shoes 
that facilitate heel striking.

INTRODUCTION 
Plantar callosities and ulcers are one of the main 
factors leading to serious complication in the diabetic 
foot. Increased plantar foot pressures are the main 
cause for plantar keratosis leading to foot ulcers in 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Common areas for 
ulcers are under the metatarsal heads and every effort 
should be done to reduce plantar foot pressures in 
trying to prevent callosities and plantar ulcers. 
Orthotic devices believed to be efficient in plantar foot 
pressure reduction.. In this study we present the effect 
of a novel orthotic insert that was designed to reduce 
the plantar pressure under the metatarsal heads. We 
hypothesized that with this special insert a reduction in 
planar pressures under the metatrsal heads will be seen 
compared to standard costum-made orthotics.
METHODS
Ten subjects were evaluated while walking (4.5 km/h ) 
with: a) standard costum-made orthotics b) newly 
designed orthotic. The newly designed orthotic is 
based on integrating metatarsal bar and a pad (figure 
1).  In-shoe plantar pressure measurement was 
performed using Pedar-x system (Novel gmbh, 
Munich). The data of four steps for each leg were 
collected for each measuring condition. The average 
peak plantar pressure (N/cm2) was calculated for 10 
zones of interest of the foot. The analysis included 
comparison of standard-custom made orthotics to the 
newly designed orthotic. 
Figure 1: The  newly designed orthotic 
RESULTS
The newly design orthotic reduced average peak 
pressures in the second and lateral metatarsals and 
increased average peak pressures in the heel, midfoot 
,1st and 2nd toes (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Comparasion of plantar pressure  
DISCUSION 
This study has shown that, on average, newly designed 
orthotic proved to reduce the plantar pressures in the 
2nd metatarsal and lateral metatarsal by 22% and 31 % 
repectively. Being the metatrsals the most common 
area for callosities and plantar ulcers in a diabetic foot, 
the newly designed orthotic may be efficient in 
prevent ulceration and to improve wound healing. 
However, the tested orthotic increased the mean peak 
pressure in the mid foot and toes by 22% and 36 % 
repectively. This redistribution of load may put in risk 
especially the toes. Frequent monitoring may be 
required in order to make sure that not only callosities 
and ulcers improve in areas where plantar pressure 
is reduced by this device, but also that new callosities 
are not created in areas where pressure is increased 
with this special insert.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Plantar pressure measurements have been 
established as a method for the assessment of foot 
loading and functional restoration of foot-related 
problems in adults and children. For clinical problems, 
the effects of conservative or surgical treatment can be 
evaluated with repeated measurements that may help 
to demonstrate the changes induced by the chosen 
treatment option (Rosenbaum 1997). However, several 
factors have been identified as influential so that they 
should be taken into consideration.  
 
For adults, gait speed changes may alter peak 
pressures and the regional load distribution but does 
not affect the whole foot uniformly (Rosenbaum 
1994). For children in the early stages of gait 
acquisition, this effect has not been evaluated yet. 
Therefore, the present study investigated how changes 
in gait speed would affect foot loading characteristics 
in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Twenty healthy children (11 male; 9 female) 
between 4 and 12 years of age participated in plantar 
pressure measurements at normal, slow and fast 
walking speeds. They were asked to walk barefoot 
across a capacitive pressure distribution platform 
(emed-ST) that was embedded flush in a 5.0 x 0.8 m 
walkway.  
 
Gait speed was measured with infrared light 
gates (AF-Sport Timing System, Wesel; 10 ms 
resolution) that were adjusted to the child’s shoulder 
height. After self-selected normal walking (n), the 
children were asked to walk slow (s) and fast (f) until 
5 valid trials from both feet were stored at each gait 
speed.  
 
Footprints were subdivided into 10 regions of 
interest: lateral and medial heel; lateral and medial 
midfoot; 1st, 2nd and 3rd-5th metatarsals; hallux; 2nd toe; 
toes 3-5. 
 
As dynamic parameters peak pressure (kPa), 
contact time (ms) and maximum force (% body 
weight) were evaluated for the whole foot and the 
regions of interest.  
 
The dynamic parameters were statistically tested 
by using the GLM (generalized linear model) for 
repeated measures. The level of significance was set at 
p < 0.05. 
RESULTS
 
The average gait speed was 0.77±0.07 m/s for 
slow, 1.20±0.06 m/s for normal and 1.65±0.06 m/s for 
fast walking. The contact time decreased significantly 
from 808±118 ms (s) to 589±71 ms (n) and 443±44 
ms (f, p<0.001). The maximum force increased from 
105±11% body weight (s) to 115±11% (n) and 
127±16% (f, p<0.001).
The changes were most 
pronounced in the heel and hallux but showed even a 
decrease in the lateral midfoot and forefoot. The peak 
pressure of the whole foot increased significantly from 
340±130 kPa (s) to 392±91 kPa (n) and 524±178 kPa 
(f, p<0.001), especially in the heel, 1st and 2nd
metatarsals and toes but not in the lateral midfoot and 
metatarsals 3-5. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The effects of systematically altering gait 
speed were demonstrated in children. Similar to 
the adults, the loading increase is not uniformly 
distributed across the whole plantar surface but is 
concentrated on the heel, 1st and 2nd metatarsals 
and the toes. The decreased loading in the 
metatarsals 3-5 that was seen in adults, could 
only partly be confirmed for the children.  
In conclusion, the results underline the 
importance to ensure comparable gait speed for 
repeated measurements in a clinical follow-up of 
single patients also for children. If this cannot be 
achieved 
e.g. 
because 
of 
age-dependent 
developmental phases, comparisons should bear 
the potential changes in mind that were 
demonstrated in the present results.

INTRODUCTION 
 
It has been reported that intense exhaustive 
running increased forefoot loading in experienced 
adult runners and may explain some foot/ankle 
overuse injuries (Weist 2004). However to our 
knowledge no studies investigated that topic in 
adolescent athletes. The aim of this study was to 
examine the effects of intense running to exhaustion 
(Tlim) on the in-shoe plantar pressure patterns in 
young elite middle-distance athletes
METHODS
 
Eleven male adolescent distance runners (age: 
16.9±2.0, body mass: 54.6±8.6 kg, height: 170.6±10.9 
cm, maximal aerobic speed: 18.7±1.5 km.h-1) 
performed a constant-pace Tlim at 95% of their 
maximal aerobic speed (17.8±1.4 km.h-1) on a 
treadmill 
(h/p/Cosmos, 
Nussdorf-Traunstein, 
Germany). 
 
Plantar pressure measurements were performed 
with one sensor insole worn in the right running shoe 
(Novel, Munich, Germany). 
 
Data were recorded first at 1 minute after the 
start (1 min) and 30 s prior exhaustion (max). A 
regional analysis was performed utilizing nine 
separate ‘‘masks’’ or areas of the foot (Groupmask 
Evaluation, Novel, Munich, Germany). 
 
Mean area (mA) and contact time (CT) were 
determined for the nine selected regions. In addition, 
the relative load (RL%)  was calculated as the force 
time integral in each individual region divided by the 
force time integral for the total plantar foot surface. 
 
One Way ANOVA Repeated Measures was 
performed and Tukey post-hoc analyses were used. 
Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Running time to exhaustion was 8.8±3.4 min. 
Between 1 min and max, significant increase in CT (P 
< 0.001) was observed in all regions except Hallux. 
mA (Fig. 1) and RL% (Fig. 2) increased significantly 
under the medial midfoot area. The other measured 
parameters did not change. 
The longer CT in fatiguing conditions may result 
from a reduced strength and stretch-shortening-cycle 
efficiency of plantar flexor muscles. In adults, the 
following over load of the medial arch of the foot is 
the first phase of a compensatory midfoot landing 
strategy (Willson 1999) and induced also medial and 
central heads of metatarsal harmful overload (Weist 
2004). Conversely no forefoot overload effect was 
reported in the present results for adolescent athletes.  
Then we may assume that the medial arch of the 
foot is a structure of primary interest to absorb the 
increased foot loadings in fatiguing conditions in 
young elite middle-distance 
runners. 
Therefore 
reinforcement of the muscles supporting the medial 
arch might be implemented in foot/ankle injuries 
prevention programs.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Biomechanical differences between healthy feet 
(pes planus, rectus, and cavus) and those with 
pathology (diabetic hallux valgus) may be related to 
their fundamental forefoot geometries. The specific 
aim of this project is to quantify and compare conic 
curve parameters among healthy and diabetic feet. 
METHODS
 
We hypothesized that asymptomatic healthy 
individuals with pes planus, rectus, and cavus feet and 
diabetics with hallux valgus will show differences in 
conic curve equation parameters.  Sixty-one healthy 
test subjects were stratified according to resting 
calcaneal stance position and forefoot to rearfoot 
relationship into their foot types at HSS.  Patients with 
Diabetes and hallux valgus were evaluated at TUSPM.  
The x-y-z metatarsal head (MTH) locations were 
acquired with 3D motion analysis.  A unique conic 
curve1 was fit to each set of points and its resulting 
equation normalized by the first term (see Figure 1).  
Parameters of interest were B, C, D, E, and curve 
eccentricity.  Data were analyzed with a univariate 
mixed-effect analysis of variance model followed by 
Bonferroni post-hoc t tests.  Foot type and trial were 
modeled as fixed and random effects.

conic (blue curve) is defined uniquely by the equation:

RESULTS
 
The conic model did not significantly distinguish 
among foot type with the exception of parameter D, 
the x-axis scaling factor in the conic curve equation; it 
distinguished rectus from diabetic feet with hallux 
valgus.  As shown in Figure 2 several structural 
variables had significant Pearson correlations with 
model parameters; in particular parameter D was 
significantly correlated to most.

DISCUSSION 
 
The geometric forefoot model was significantly 
correlated with AHI, 1st MPJ flexibility and laxity, 
total maximum plantar force and peak pressure 
beneath the heel.  This suggests that simple models 
may be useful to differentiate normal vs. pathological 
feet.

INTRODUCTION: Nociceptive Capacity of a 
Plantar Irritating Stimulus (NCPIS) affects plantar 
cutaneous somaesthesia and influences kinetic 
posture by modifying control systems (1,9). This 
NCPIS doesn’t express itself like reason of pain in 
podiatrist consultations but affects the postural 
control [1].  To understand better the repercussions of 
the NCPIS on gait analysis, we analysed the 
relationship 
between 
dynamic 
baropedograpphy 
through Latero-Medial Index (L/M , 2-4,7) of area: 
L/MA and force: L/MF ; Fig. n°1) of 15 subjects with 
NCPIS (pathological: P) and without NCPIS (non 
pathological: NP). Nociceptive sensory of NCIPS on 
walking track (H) was reduced by foam (F) during 
walking before and/or on baropedography force plate 
(8). 4 levels of sensory information were applied: 
start walking (S) and arrival (A) on the force plate 
were delivered the same way with the tactile 
information: hard (SHAH), foam (SFAF); start 
walking and arrival on the force plate crossed each 
other (SHAF ; SFAH). ANOVA and Schéffe post-hoc 
tests were used to test the possible difference between 
P and NP for L/MF and L/MA.  
RESULTS: No significant differences were present 
among the L/MF: between P and NP (F=0.080; 
p=0.779), between H and F (F =0.1622; p=0.190), no 
inter action P/NP and H/F (F=0.513; p=0.674). 
Results were significantly different with regard to its 
L/MA: between P and NP (F = 63.90; p<0.0001), 
between H and F (F= 299.37; p<0.0001) and inter 
action P/NP and H/F ((F = 295.83; p<0.0001). Post 
Hoc test showed no significantly difference into P 
and NP when start walking was on foam 
independently of the quality of arrival (H or F). 
CONCLUSION: No modifications of L/MF are 
present because L/MF are modified when weight add 
up like the literature explain. For L/MA differences 
are observed. For P, arrival on foam reduces 
nociceptivce cue for NCPI (1,8). Their sensory 
information will come back as normal. Normalization 
of sensory feedback will be improving muscular 
responses (5,7). Their kinetic foot pattern will find 
back the pattern of subject to NP (no difference into 
SFAH, 5-6, 8).
Those results confirm the potential nociceptive 
capacity of the NCPI on postural control and posturo 
kinetic capacity.

INTRODUCTION 
 
This study was motivated by a demand to prove 
scientifically the fact that applying an optimum 
interlocking pattern to electrical beds can be helpful to 
prevention of bedsore in bedridden patients (Evan and 
Loyal, 2007; Maki, 2009).  
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Participants: Following Institutional Review Board 
approval, seven healthy female (65.6 ± 4.1 years, 
151.2 ± 3.8cm, and 62.6 ± 5.6kg; mean±SD) were 
participated. 
Electrical Bed Selection: Two electrical bed (Type A: 
KQ-86320, Paramount Bed, Japan and Type B: PZB-
H3S, Platz Bed, Japan) were chosen by the analyses of 
market price, market share, sales volume, user 
approaching, brand awareness, test convenience, etc. 
Electrical Bed Operation: Automatic interlocking 
patterns built-in to the electrical beds were used for 
the electrical bed operations. Here, automatic 
interlocking patterns were different from each other in 
characteristics. 
Measurements and Data Acquisition: Contact area 
and pressure distribution were measured by pressure 
mapping system (Pliance FTX, Novel, Germany) to 
identify a possibility of bedsore occurrence and an 
effect of the automatic interlocking pattern change. 
They were also used in considering contact and 
boundary conditions in musculoskeletal modeling and 
to validate the musculoskeletal models described 
below. 
Three-dimensional 
(3D) 
motions 
were 
measured by 3D motion analysis system (VICON 
Motion System, VICON Ltd., England) to identify the 
characteristics of the automatic interlocking patterns 
of the electrical beds and the participant motions. Here, 
data of the 3D motions were used in musculoskeletal 
modeling described below.  
Musculoskeletal Modeling and Analysis: To identify 
alteration of normal and shear forces on the body of 
the participant as changing the automatic interlocking 
pattern of the electrical bed, musculoskeletal models 
for the electrical beds and participants were developed 
by BRG. LifeMOD (LifeModeler, Inc., USA).  
Statistical Analysis: A paired t-test and one-way 
ANOVA test with Tukey’s-b post hoc multiple 
comparisons were used to identify existence and 
nonexistence of statistically significant differences. 
Here, the significance levels for all statistical tests 
were set at 0.05. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Patterns and values of contact area and pressure 
distribution were significantly alerted as changing the 
automatic interlocking pattern of the electrical bed 
(p<0.05) (Figure. 1). Patterns and values of normal 
and shear forces were also altered by the automatic 
interlocking pattern changes (Figure 2). It was 
generally found 
that 
as 
using 
the automatic 
interlocking pattern of Type B bed, pressure values 
were repeatedly approached or exceed to the critical 
value of bedsore occurrence. Also, it was identified 
that normal and shear forces generated by using the 
automatic interlocking pattern of Type B bed were 
generally higher than those of Type A bed. These 
results indicated that using the automatic interlocking 
pattern of Type B bed could be more vulnerable to 
bedsore than using that of Type A bed. Therefore, 
from the current study, it is judged that considering an 
optimum interlocking pattern in manufacturing 
electrical bed may be one of important factors to 
prevention of bedsore.

INTRODUCTION 
 
This study was aimed at 1) identification of the 
hypothesis that musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) can 
be occurred to caregivers by repeated uses of power-
lift (Sean, 2005) and 2) suggestion of biomechanical 
factors to be considered to reduce the risk of MSDs if 
the hypothesis is true. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Participants: Following Institutional Review Board 
approval, one young healthy man (age: 26 years, 
height: 172cm, weight: 67 kg) was participated. 
Power-Lift Selection: Two power-lifts (Type A: 
Bolero, ARJO, USA and Type B: MONA, 
Horcher, USA) were chosen by the analyses of 
market price, market share, sales volume, user 
approaching, brand awareness, test convenience, etc. 
Power-Lift Operation: Operations to drive power-lift 
at strait and curve tracks were selected based on the 
analysis of power-lift workings performed frequently 
at care facilities. Then, the participant operated power-
lift during ten minutes and took a rest for forty 
minutes between operations. 
Measurements and Data Acquisition: Ten EMG 
sensors (Tringo Wireless EMG System, DELSYS, 
USA) were attached to the right muscles of the 
participant (Table 1). The EMG data were analyzed by 
using MDF (Median Frequency) technique. Contact 
area and pressure distribution were measured by 
pressure mapping system by using pedar and pliance 
system (Novel gmbh, Germany) to identify a risk of 
MSDs. They were also used in considering contact 
and boundary conditions in musculoskeletal modeling 
and to validate the musculoskeletal models described 
below. 
Three-dimensional 
(3D) 
motions 
were 
measured by VICON Motion System (VICON Ltd., 
England) to identify the characteristics of motions of 
the power-lift and the participant motions. Here, data 
of the 3D motions were used in musculoskeletal 
modeling described below.  
Musculoskeletal Modeling and Analysis: To identify 
muscle forces and joint torques required for power-lift 
operations, musculoskeletal models for the power-lift 
and the participants were developed by BRG. 
LifeMOD (LifeModeler, Inc., USA). Additionally, the 
musculoskeletal models were used to identify how 
much effective in reduction of the risk of MSDs when 
the suggested biomechanical factors were considered 
in new power-lift design.  
Statistical Analysis: A paired t-test was used to 
identify existence and nonexistence of statistically 
significant differences. Here, the significance level 
was set at 0.05. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Possibility of muscle fatigue occurrence was 
generally increased during power-lift workings 
(p<0.05) (Table 1). This result indicates that our 
hypothesis is acceptable and further more power-lift 
design should be improved with consideration of 
biomechanical and ergonomic factors. The contact 
area and pressure generated as using Type A power-
lift was generally lower and higher, respectively, than 
those as using Type B power-lift (p<0.05) (Figure 1). 
The results also showed that the contact area and 
pressure were depended on power-lift design, 
particular in handle and caster shapes (Figure 1). 
Therefore, from the results obtained the current study, 
it is supposed that improvement of power-lift design 
with consideration of biomechanical and ergonomic 
factors (here, handle and caster shapes) may be one of 
solutions for reduction of the risk of MSDs.

PURPOSE
 
Little research has been conducted to determine 
the differences in plantar loading patterns following 
surgical repair of Achilles tendon ruptures versus 
displaced calcaneal fractures (Schepers et al, 2008; 
Hastings et al, 2000).  While both types of traumatic 
injuries involve significant hindfoot structures, one 
could expect differences in plantar loading as a result 
of the characteristics of the involved tissues.  The 
intent of this preliminary study was to assess the 
variations in plantar loading patterns in individuals 
who had undergone a surgical repair of a) Achilles 
tendon following rupture or 2) intra-articular calcaneal 
or tibial plafond fracture. 
SUBJECTS 
 
Ten male subjects participated in the study; five 
had Achilles tendon repairs (ATR) and five were post-
Open Reduction Internal Fixation for hindfoot 
fractures including intra-articular calcaneal or tibial 
plafond fractures (HFFx).  The mean age of the ATR 
patients was 51.2 years and 33.0 years for the HFFX.  
At the time of testing, approximately 3 to 4 months 
post-surgery, all subjects were able to ambulate 
without using an assistive device.  All subjects had no 
history of congenital or traumatic deformity or foot 
pain on the non-involved side. 
METHODS
 
Each subject was asked to walk over a 15-meter 
walkway while in-shoe pressure data were collected 
using the PEDAR-X system.  For all in-shoe pressure 
measurements, the sensor insoles were positioned over 
a flat piece of firm insole material (durometer = 58 
Shore A) that was placed in a flat rubber-soled, non-
contoured karate shoe.  Ten consecutive steps from the 
middle 8-meters of the walkway for both the involved 
and un-involved feet were selected for analysis. Novel 
percent mask and group mask software were used to 
determine maximum mean pressure (MMP) and 
normalized Maximum Force (MaxF) for each of the 
following plantar regions: medial heel (1), lateral heel 
(2), medial midfoot (3), lateral midfoot (4), medial 
forefoot (5), and lateral forefoot (6).  A MANOVA 
was used to determine those plantar regions in which 
significant differences occurred between MMP and 
MaxF between the two groups. Based on those results, 
an ANOVA and Tukey’s pairwise comparisons were 
used to further analyze those plantar regions that were 
statistically significant.  For this abstract, only the 
plantar pressure results for the involved side will be 
presented. 
Figure 1: MANOVA results for Maximum Mean 
Pressure (MMP) (1 = HFFx; 2 = ATR). 
RESULTS
 
MaxF was not significantly different between 
ATR and HFFx for any of the six plantar regions 
analyzed.  MMP was significantly decreased (p < .05) 
in the medial midfoot and medial forefoot plantar 
regions for the HFFx group in comparison to the ATR 
group.   
 
Stance phase durations were significantly 
decreased (p < .05) between the involved and non-
involved limbs for the HFFx group but not for the 
ATR group.  The mean stance duration for the 
involved and non-involved limbs was: 1.01 sec and 
0.86 sec for HFFx and 0.78 sec and 0.77 for ATR. 
 
  
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Although a small cohort of subjects were 
evaluated in this preliminary study, it would appear 
that boney trauma of the hindfoot when compared to 
soft tissue injury, not only significantly slows walking 
speed, but also substantially reduces the amount of 
medial plantar loading of the midfoot and forefoot 
regions of the foot.  These results have important 
implications for foot orthoses design.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Functional hallux limitus (FHL) (Dananberg, 
1986) has been described as a predecessor to structural 
and debilitating deformities such as hallux rigidus and 
lesser metatarsalgia. Compensatory changes include 
increased lesser metatarsal plantar pressures and 
decreased weight bearing under the hallux. Case 
reports have shown use of a sub-hallucial wedge to 
decrease lesser metatarsal pain and increase weight 
bearing pressures under the first metatarsal phalangeal 
joint (1st MTPJ). (Clough, 2005) Other studies have 
demonstrated that control of excessive STJ pronation 
with an orthotic arch support increases 1st MTPJ 
dorsiflexion in subjects with FHL. (Munuera, 2006) 
The purpose of this pilot study was to objectively 
evaluate the biomechanical effect of a sub hallux 
wedge and arch support in subjects with FHL. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Ten asymptomatic healthy subjects with FHL 
were evaluated. All subjects had >50º of dorsiflexion 
of the 1st MTPJ in open kinetic chain and <30 º of 
dorsiflexion in weight bearing as measured with a 
goniometer. Dynamic plantar pressure was collected 
using a EMED-X (Novel LLC, St. Paul, MN) in three 
test conditions; barefoot (BF), barefoot with a sub 
hallucial wedge (CW), and barefoot with a sub 
hallucial wedge and arch support (CWA) during self-
selected comfortable paced walking. Sub-hallucial 
wedge and medial arch support were placed onto each 
foot using a custom designed brace. Peak pressure 
time integrals (PTI) were analyzed under metatarsal 
heads 1-5 and the hallux. One way Analysis of 
Variance was performed at a significance level of 
0.05.
RESULTS
 
Ten subjects (20 feet), with mean age of 26.8 
years and BMI of 27.8 kg/m2, participated in the 
study. There was no statistically significant difference 
in self-selected walking speed (mean 1.26m/s) across 
3 conditions. As expected, PTI beneath 1st MTPJ was 
significantly lower than 2nd and 3rd MTPJs in barefoot 
walking. 
When 
subjects 
walked 
with 
CWA, 
significantly reduced PTI was noted under MTPJs 2-5, 
compared to both BF and CW conditions (Figure 1).

CONCLUSION 
 
A sub-hallucial wedge (CW) by itself did not 
alter dynamic plantar pressure when compared to 
barefoot comfortable paced walking. The combination 
of the sub hallucial wedge with a medial arch support 
significantly reduced PTI under all lesser metatarsal 
heads. The hallucial wedge and medial arch support 
appear to compliment one another, suggesting the 
importance of addressing both forefoot and rearfoot 
mechanics when treating patients with a functional 
limitation of the 1st MTPJ.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Classical ballet teaching and practice are strongly 
influenced by tradition, however, biomechanical 
investigations have recently contributed to ensure a 
more secure practice and an evidence-oriented 
teaching (IMURA et al., 2008). This study aims to 
describe the effects of slippers and limb positioning on 
plantar pressure variables produced by selected 
techniques of classical ballet.  
 
METHODOLOGY 
Fourteen non-professional female dancers aged 
between 15 and 25 years old, without any 
musculoskeletal impairment, who have practiced for at 
least seven years volunteered to this study. They 
performed three valid trials of standing for four 
seconds in the following balance postures: attitude
devant, derriére and attitude a la second, with slippers 
and barefoot.  
Plantar pressure variables were quantified with an 
EMED platform (Novel, Germany) at 50 Hz sampling 
rate. Peak pressures and contact areas where compared 
between slippers vs. barefoot conditions and for the 
three different lower limb positions with a univariate 
ANOVA-test. Significant level was determined for p  
0.05.   
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Contact areas (Table 1) were statistically higher 
for the barefoot condition and no effect of the balance 
postures were found. The barefoot/slippers effect was 
not found for the contact area.

These results are in accordance with the higher 
stability reported by the dancers during the barefoot 
trials, compared to the trials performed with slippers. 
The use of slippers may have slightly limited and 
compressed dancers’ toes, a fact that may have 
reduced the contact area with the ground and affected 
the peak pressures.  
In conclusion, our findings illustrate the foot 
loading characteristics during the performance of 
balance postures. Moreover, the foot training may be 
emphasized and have beneficial effects for the 
performance of these classical ballet techniques.

INTRODUCTION 
Pressure ulcers (PU) are a significant and costly 
problem in health care area. Alternating pressure air 
mattress (APAM) is one of the popular product for 
preventing PU. Usual operating parameters of APAM 
are alternating cycle time and air cell pressure level. 
The objective of current study is to quantify a tissue 
vitality with a variation of alternating cycle time 
through tissue perfusion and interface pressure 
measurement 
to 
understand 
proper 
operating 
conditions.
METHOD
Six male(age:68.6±5.1, BMI:24.5±3.2) and six female 
subjects(age:64.1±4.2, BMI:23.3±2.5) were selected 
to test the tissue perfusion and pressure distributions at 
the air mattress(3-cell type, average air cell pressure: 
34~37mmHg, measuring time:1hour). For each 3 
alternating cycle time conditions(3,5,10min). TCM4 
Oximeters(Radiometer A/S, Denmark) were used to 
record transcutaneous partial pressures of oxygen(tcPO2)
and carbon dioxide(tcPCO2) from the tissue. Electrodes 
were calibrated using known gases and were attached 
to the skin at chest, sacrum and heel. Pliance pressure 
mapping system (Novel, Germany) which consists of a 
thin mat containing grids of miniature pressure sensors, 
was placed between the subject and the mattress, one 
at a time, to electronically record information on 
pressure distributions. Force and peak, mean pressure 
data was collected with the Pliance. 
RESULTS
The recovery & occlusion of tissue perfusion appeared 
according to the deflation & inflation of air cell. 
Perfusion recovery time(tR) and recovered pressure(PR)
were defined as dynamic parameters of tissue 
perfusion from 5% to 95% of tcPO2 values during 
tissue recovery period(Figure 1). Recovery time and 
recovered pressure for each alternating cycle time 
conditions are given at sacrum (Figure 2). From the 
figure, we can see the distinct results that shorter 
alternating cycle condition gives faster tissue recovery. 
And the recovered pressure decreased gradually with 
the increase of alternating cycle time. Thus these  
results means that shorter cycle time is more effective 
in the aspect of tissue vitality because faster and 
stronger recovery characteristics can be acquired. 
However peak pressure and force from interface 
pressure measurement was irregularly changed with 
alternating cycle time(Figure 3). This might be 
affected by time variant interface condition.

condition, of the APAM application for PU prevention. 
The fining may contribute to understanding dynamic

INTRODUCTION 
 
Most FE models in the literatur 1, 2, 3   are based 
on boundary conditions without concerning muscular 
forces of the lower leg. The aim of our study was to 
get boundary conditions using data of a gait analysis 
in combination with ANYBODY muscle modelling. 
METHODS
 
We examined 10 healthy subjects with a Vicon 
MX System (6 Cameras). Additionally we performed 
an AMTI force platform, a Novel SF pressure 
measurement System and a MegaWin EMG system, 
synchronized with the Vicon system. The muscle 
forces were determined using a slightly modified 
model 
from 
the 
repository 
AMMRV1.1 
of 
ANYBODY 
TECHNOLOGY 
(Vaughan). 
Postprocessing with the EMG data was done. A 
modified finite element model from the Website 
ww.ulb.ac.be/project/vakhum/ which is based on CT 
Scan was used. Contacts between bones were 
considered with 3 different methods. 1. as bonded, 2. 
as joints with less friction and 3. as frictional contact 
with 
additional 
ligaments 
because 
of 
a 
underconstrained model. We were firstly interested in 
reaction forces/moments and not in stress and strain. 
Therefore we did a quasi static analysis computing the 
reaction forces/moments in every 10% of stance phase 
in each joint. The foot was fixed at the end of the tibia 
and the fibula. The position of the foot segments in the 
FE model were adapted  due to the kinematic 
measurements. The reaction forces we measured with 
a force plate and an EMED SF as well as a PEDAR 
System. As a novel method to get additional boundary 
condition we used the model of Vaughan from the 
ANYBODY muscle modelling Repository. 
RESULTS
 
Reaction forces and moments were with all 3 
methods comparable, opposite to stress and strain 
which showed huge differences, especially in contact 
regions. Reaction forces and moments in the ankle 
joint computed with our FE model fit very well with 
results we get from the ANYBODY model. In other 
joints such as TMT and MTP joints we get similar 
results as for example Jacob4 described. 
DISCUSSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
 
The above shown method to get the boundary 
conditions for an FE Model from gait analysis and 
ANYBODY modelling is probably a valuable method 
for clinicians in the future. The method seems to be 
satisfactory to get reaction forces and moments.  
 
There are further investigations necessary, to 
simulate stress and strain. The main problem here 
seems to be an underconstrained model using 
frictionless contacts. Main reason for that are the 
unbalanced muscle forces from the ANYBODY 
modelling system in combination with the applicated 
geometry of the foot. Other possibilities to avoid a 
underconstrained model such as the introduction of 
ligaments or weak springs even though frictional 
contact is in our understanding not a satisfactory 
solution.

RELIABILITY OF IN-SOLE PLANTAR PRESSURE USING SIMPLE AND DETAILED 
MASKS OF THE FOREFOOT, MIDFOOT, AND HINDFOOT

Abt, Timothy C. Sell, Scott M. Lephart 
Neuromuscular Research Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh, PA 
BACKGROUND 
 
Plantar pressure measurements obtained with in-
shoe pressure sensor insoles can be analyzed by 
dividing the foot into anatomical regions using masks. 
A simple mask could divide the foot into four regions: 
toes, forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot. A detailed mask 
could further divide these regions to capture data from 
specific anatomical regions/structures. For example, 
dividing the forefoot into individual metatarsals may 
help clinicians and researchers indentify individuals 
who are at increased risk of stress-related injuries to 
these structures (e.g. stress fracture). Regardless of 
which mask is applied, these measures must be 
reliable. The purpose of this study was to obtain the 
reliability of in-sole plantar pressure measurements 
using simple and detailed masks and to determine 
which is more reliable. 
  
METHODS
 
Ten healthy males (n=8) and females (n=2) 
participated in this study (age: 27.7 ± 4.1 years, mass: 
77.6 ± 10.7 kg, height: 174.3 ± 7.0 cm). Subjects 
performed a gait task on two different days using the 
PEDAR-X  
system 
(Novel 
GmbH, 
Munich, 
Germany) to measure in-sole plantar pressures 
(100Hz) using their own athletic footwear (without 
socks). After familiarization of the task, subjects 
performed three trials of 20 consecutive straight-line 
walking steps using usual gait across a level, 
laboratory floor. 
®
 
Maximum force (MF), force-time integral (FTI), 
peak pressure (PP), pressure-time integral (PTI), and 
maximum mean pressure (MMP) were calculated for 
simple and detailed masks. Both masks divided the 
foot into three primary regions: the forefoot, midfoot, 
and hindfoot. The simple mask divided the forefoot 
into metatarsal 1, 2, and 3-5; and did not divide the 
midfoot and hindfoot. The detailed mask divided the 
forefoot into individual metatarsals and the midfoot 
and hindfoot into medial/lateral regions. Intraclass 
correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated using a 
two-way random effects model (ICC [2,k]). ICCs were 
averaged for each variable to obtain a single ICC 
value for the simple and detailed masks. Left and right 
foot measurements were combined for the analyses. A 
t-test was used to identify significant differences 
between the simple and detailed masks (Į=0.05). 
RESULTS
 
No significant differences were found between 
the simple and detailed masks. Maximum force and 
force-time-integral resulted in excellent reliability 
(ICC>0.90) for all masks and regions. Peak pressure, 
pressure-time-integral, and maximum mean pressure 
resulted in good reliability (ICC>0.70) for all masks 
and regions.

DISCUSSION 
 
In-sole plantar pressure measurements obtained 
demonstrated good reliability for all masks and 
regions indicating that the PEDAR-X® system is 
capable of collecting reliable data, regardless of which 
mask is utilized. These findings are similar those of 
previous studies (Boyd et al, 1997; Putti el al, 2007). 
The lowest ICC was for MMP using the detailed mask 
for the midfoot, which may be a function of the small 
contact area of the medial midfoot. Since the contact 
area is relatively small, it is possible that even small 
variation in the rollover pattern during gait may 
significantly affect measurements in this region. It is 
therefore recommended to not subdivide this region in 
order to maximize the reliability of the measurements 
obtained, both in the clinical and research settings.

THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE, LIGAMENT LAXITY AND HORMONAL 
FLUCTUATION ON PLANTAR PRESSURE IN FEMALE ATHLETES

INTRODUCTION
 
Overuse injuries of the lower extremity compose 
over 20% of injuries in collegiate athletes, up to 50% 
of injuries in pediatric athletics (Arendt, 2003, 
Bennell, et al., 1996, Dalton, 1992) and a considerable 
portion of injuries in military recruits (Milgrom, et al.,
1985, Rauh, et al., 2006).  Like some traumatic 
injuries 
(acl 
tears) 
overuse/stress 
injuries 
are 
significantly more frequently observed in women 
(Taunton, et al., 2002).  The etiology of sex 
differences in overuse injuries has been associated 
with various factors including training, anatomical 
differences, hormonal differences, and joint laxity.  
Joint laxity has also been associated with fluctuating 
hormone levels.  Specifically, estrogen has been 
associated with suppression of collagen synthesis and 
decreased ligament cross-sectional area (Abubaker, et 
al., 1996, Booth, et al., 1970, Liu, et al., 1997, 
Samuel, et al., 1996). As collagen serves to provide 
stiffness to biological tissues such as ligaments and 
tendons, its breakdown can play a key role in 
enhanced joint laxity.  In this study we quantify 
hormone levels, ligament laxity, and plantar pressure 
distribution to investigate the extent to which hormone 
fluctuation and fatigue interact to influence plantar 
pressure distribution and lower limb load. 
METHODS
 
Twenty-four female collegiate athletes were 
tested, 8 for a four-week protocol and 16 for a twelve-
week protocol.  Blood was drawn each visit and 
subsequently assayed for estradiol content using an 
ELISA kit.  Ankle ligament laxity was measured using 
an ankle arthrometer, and subjects walked, ran and cut 
barefoot over an EMED-SF plantar pressure platform.  
Following a fatigue test (stair running followed by a 
modified hurdle beep test), lactate levels, ankle laxity 
and plantar pressure were re-measured. Repeated 
measures ANOVA was used to compare ligament 
laxity and plantar pressure in 7 foot regions across 
menstrual weeks and fatigue states.   
RESULTS
 
Ankle ligament laxity increased following 
fatigue (p<0.05). There was also significant variation 
across subjects (p<0.01). Females had more ligament 
laxity than males (p<0.01), and there was an 
interaction between gender and fatigue such that 
females experienced a greater increase in ligament 
laxity post-fatigue than males. There was a significant 
interaction between menstrual week and fatigue such 
that the effect of fatigue was significantly greater in 
week 4 and lower in week 2 than any other menstrual 
week.  While hormone levels may not themselves 
affect ligament laxity, the interaction of hormone level 
and fatigue may influence ligament laxity. 
Peak plantar pressures exhibit variation across 
foot region, menstrual week and fatigue condition.  
Peak pressures in metatarsals 2-5 are significantly 
(p<0.01) lower post-fatigue than pre-fatigue.  Peak 
pressures in the medial and lateral midfoot, however, 
vary based on menstrual week and fatigue condition.  
In weeks 1 and 2 post-fatigue midfoot peak pressure 
are higher post-fatigue than pre-fatigue (p<0.05), 
while post-fatigue pressures are slightly lower than 
pre-fatigue pressures in weeks 3 and 4. Week 2 is also 
the week of greatest ligament laxity, suggesting foot 
ligament laxity is allowing some midfoot collapse, 
especially post-fatigue when the plantarflexors are 
fatigued and providing less load resistance (Sharkey,
et al., 1999, Weist, et al., 2004). This laxity may also 
reduce load transmission to the metatarsal heads.

BACKGROUND 
 
Pedobarographic platforms allow for assessment 
of plantar pressures at the foot-ground interface 
whereas pedobaragraphic insoles allow for assessment 
at the foot-shoe interface. It has been suggested that 
barefoot assessments may be more sensitive in 
detecting risk factors for the development of exercise 
related lower leg pain than shod assessments 
(Willems, 2007). Plantar pressures may be altered or 
attenuated by footwear, thereby making detection of 
small but significant variations in plantar pressure 
measurements more difficult in shod conditions. In 
addition, barefoot assessments require less subject 
preparation, may allow for data to be collected on 
more subjects in a shorter period of time, and require a 
smaller 
laboratory 
space, 
thereby 
potentially 
simplifying the data collection process. The purpose of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
compare 
plantar 
pressure 
measurements obtained while barefoot to those 
obtained while shod.  
METHODS
 
Ten healthy males (n=8) and females (n=2) 
participated in this study (age: 27.7 ± 4.1 years, mass: 
77.6 ± 10.7 kg, height: 174.3 ± 7.0 cm). Data were 
collected on two different days in both barefoot and 
shod 
conditions. 
Barefoot 
measurements 
were 
obtained with the EMED-X  (Novel GmbH, Munich, 
Germany), sampling at 100Hz. A two-step approach at 
a self-selected speed was utilized for all trials. After 
familiarization of the task, subjects performed 10 
right-foot trials. 
®
 
Shod measurements were obtained with the 
PEDAR-X  
system 
(Novel 
GmbH, 
Munich, 
Germany), sampling at 100Hz. Subjects used their 
own athletic footwear, without socks, and were asked 
to practice straight-line walking at their “usual” 
walking speed. After familiarization, three trials of 20 
consecutive straight-line steps across a level tiled floor 
were recorded. 
®
 
For the barefoot trials, average maximum force 
(MF) and peak pressure (PP) were calculated for all 
trials. For the shod trials, the first and last two right 
steps were removed and MF and PP were calculated 
for the remaining right-foot steps. A similar mask was 
applied to both barefoot and shod trials with the 
following regions: medial heel, lateral heel, midfoot, 
each metatarsal (1-5), great toe, toe 2, and toes345. A 
t-test compared MF and PP obtained in the barefoot 
(EMED) and shod (PEDAR) conditions (Į=0.05). 
 
RESULTS
 
PEDAR and EMED measurements differed 
significantly in several regions (Table 1).

DISCUSSION 
 
 Statistically 
different 
plantar 
pressure 
measurements were obtained in barefoot and shod 
conditions. Peak pressure appears to be significantly 
attenuated in the hindfoot, MT2 through MT4, and the 
great toe in the shod condition. Maximum force was 
significantly attenuated in MT2 through MT4, T2 and 
T345. If the variable of interest is peak pressure, then 
barefoot assessments may be preferred. However, 
since most athletic activities are performed while shod 
and the results were inconsistent, it may be more 
appropriate to assess plantar pressure in the shod 
condition.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Manifest hallux valgus deformity remains an 
abundant fore foot condition, whose entire or definite 
cause remains controversial. The extent of first ray 
instability and in particular of the first tarso-metatarsal 
(TMT-I) joint of the affected foot remains a key 
argument in the debate for optimal surgical treatment 
in 
hallux 
valgus 
conditions 
(Coughlin 
2003). 
Numerous attempts have been undertaken to more 
precisely investigate and quantify first ray instability. 
Klaue (1994) designed an apparatus to evaluate static 
TMT-I instability and combined a clinical study with a 
cadaver radiograph analysis for validation of the 
device. Glasoe et al. (2000) modified the Rodgers 
apparatus in order to respect dynamic stabilization 
aspects 
of 
the 
foot. 
Additionally 
in 
the 
pedobarographic foot print of hallux valgus patients a 
deformity related reduced weight bearing of the first 
ray has been described (Lorei, 2006). 
In 
our 
study, 
pedobarographic 
findings 
were 
correlated to the radiographically determined degree 
of first ray mobility of the foot. 
PATIENTS AND METHOD 
 
For our study 8 patients presenting a hallux 
valgus deformity on one foot or both feet, who were 
registered for corrective foot surgery out with our 
hospital, were enrolled. Seven were female one was 
male. Mean age was 44 (range 15-65). Clinical 
symptoms like foot pain, AAOF-Score and hallux 
valgus angle and intermetarsal angle were recorded. 
For simultaneous radiographic and pedobarographic 
measurement a mobile C-arm fluoroscope (ziehm, 
Nuremburg) 
and 
a 
plantar 
pedobarographic 
measurement platform (emed novel, Munich) were 
combined in an experimental setting to allow dynamic 
gait analysis in the entire stance phase of walking 
(including heel set down and fore foot take off). 
Pulsing radiograph recording (frequency 4 pulses/s) 
allowed digital analysis in selected frames and 
determination of motion among the joints of the first 
ray of the foot in particular the TMT-I joint (CAD 
program Solid Works, 2007). Simultaneously the 
pedobarographic footprint was recorded by the 
platform and peak pressure as well as maximum force 
were analyzed. Statistical analysis of hallux valgus 
radiological characteristics and pedographic findings 
of the first ray was by Pearson´s correlation. 
RESULTS
 
All enrolled patients presented a manifest hallux 
valgus deformity and met requirements for operative 
treatment by an experienced foot surgeon blinded to 
the study set up. The mean intermetatarsal angle was 
15°(range 8°-28°) and the mean hallux valgus angle 
was 45° (range 12°-80°). A large intermetatarsal angle 
correlated significantly with an increase of peak 
pressure under the first metatarsal (p=0,014). Further-
more the radiological computer-assisted determined 
maximal dorsiflexion of the first ray (from talus till 
metatarsal head) significantly correlated with the 
extent of the intermetatarsal angle (p=0,012). Mobility 
of the first tarso-metatarsal (TMT-I) joint however 
showed a significant correlation to an increase of 
maximum force of the mid-forefoot region.  
DISCUSSION 
       Mobility of the first metatarsal ray and in 
particular of the first tarso-metatarsal joint has been 
the subject of extensive research. Various devices had 
been developed to quantify first ray mobility of the 
foot. As in our study first ray deviation was mainly 
analyzed in the sagital plane. In our study we can 
support the notion of an enlarged intermetatarsal angle 
being associated with an increased dorsiflexion of the 
first ray of the foot during gait. Further more we found 
instability of the TMT-I –joint to have an increasing 
affect on mid-forefoot maximum force that may be 
relevant for pathological correlates.

INTRODUCTION 
 
While there are many clinical and case reported 
studies of hallux valgus (HV), the etiology and 
biomechanics of the pathology remain poorly 
understood. Although previous studies have noted 
differences in peak pressures in various regions of the 
foot between individuals with and without HV 
(Kernozek 2003, Yamamoto 1996, Yavuz 2009), 
results are inconsistent and have not been confirmed in 
larger studies. The purpose of this research is to 
describe peak plantar pressures and pressure-time 
integrals in an epidemiological population-based study 
and to investigate whether these measures differ 
between those with and without HV as defined by 
standardized foot examinations. We hypothesize that it 
is possible to distinguish individuals with and without 
HV based on differences in peak pressure and 
pressure-time integral measures. 
METHODS
 
Data were obtained from a subset of participants 
enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (N = 464; 
57% female; mean age, 65 years; mean BMI, 28).  
Between 2002 and 2005, plantar pressure values were 
collected using a Tekscan Matscan system (model 
3150, resolution of 1.4 sensels/cm2) while participants 
walked at a comfortable pace barefoot across the mat. 
Data was imported into Novel software and masked 
into 12 segments (toes, submetatarsal heads 1-5, 
medial arch and heel, lateral arch and heel). Peak 
pressure and pressure time integral values were then 
calculated. Two-tailed Students T-tests assessed 
differences between those with and without HV.

RESULTS
 
Preliminary analysis revealed significant sex 
differences in plantar pressures. Therefore, subsequent 
analyses were stratified by gender. Since the right foot 
is considered more dominant, only these results are 
reported. Tables 1 and 2 present a subset of the 12 
analyzed foot areas. Female subjects with HV 
exhibited greater peak pressure values under the 
lateral arch than those without HV (p = 0.046). No 
significant differences were found in pressure-time 
integrals for females with and without HV, regardless 
of foot area. Male subjects with HV exhibited greater 
peak pressure (p=0.007) and pressure-time integral 
(p=0.015) values than those without HV under 
groupings of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th toes. 
DISCUSSION 
 
Significant gender differences in peak pressures 
and pressure time integrals were noted. The data did 
not support our hypothesis as analyses did not 
distinguish between those with and without HV based 
on pressure-related measures. It is possible that the 
accuracy and resolution of Tekscan, in comparison to 
other foot mat systems, may have affected our results. 
It is also possible, since both groups contained 
concomitant pathologies, the plantar loading effects 
for HV washed out. Future work may investigate 
whether consideration of additional foot disorders or 
deformities may better use the plantar pressure 
measures to distinguish foot pathologies.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Several criteria determine the presence and 
severity 
of 
the 
bunion 
deformity 
(hallux 
abductovalgus; HAV), a common and disabling foot 
disorder.  Radiographic relationships in the weight-
bearing dorso-plantar view include the intermetatarsal 
angle, tibial sesamoid position, and hallux abductus 
angle (HAA).  The HAA determines the amount of 
hallux deviation in HAV.  While the radiographic 
technique is well accepted, it requires a small dose of 
radiation.  Evaluating foot structure without ionizing 
radiation may be clinically useful. 
  
The emed™ Geometry software (novel GmbH, 
Munich) calculates two hallux angles based on 
dynamic footprint:  HA1 based on the relationship of 
the medial hallux to the medial foot border and HA2 
relating the center of the Hallux to the estimated 
bisection of the angle between the first and second 
metatarsals, see Figure 1(left) and 1 (center). 
Alternatively, investigators wanted to examine the 
utility a graphical analog of HA1, constructed from a 
scan of the plantar weight bearing foot (MVIa), see 
Figure 1 (right).1 However, there has been no 
comparative study between radiographic versus the 
previously mentioned alternates. 
 
Investigators examined the utility of a using the 
angles form the Geometry software or a graphical 
analog of HA1 or HA2 based on a flatbed scan of the 
plantar weight bearing foot collected to determine the 
Malleolar Valgus Index (MVI)1.  When HAV is 
present, the Hallux Abductus angle is greater than 15 
degrees2.
METHODS
 
This is a retrospective study. Twenty eight (28) 
feet with clinical diagnosis of HAV and 10 feet 
without were included. Clinical assessment of HAV, 
radiological measure of HAA, MVI foot scans and 
EMED-X dynamic footprints were available for each 
subject.  Bivariate linear fit of HA1, HA2 and MVIa 
against HAA was evaluated using JMP 8 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC) 
RESULTS
 
Correlation coefficients and root mean square 
errors of HA1, HA2, and MVIa to corresponding 
HAA measurements were calculated (0.707 and 4.17, 
0.334 and 14.8, and 0.822 and 6.17, respectively (all 
p-values <0.01).  Descriptive statistics are shown in 
Table 1.  However, none of parameters was able to 
distinguish between those feet with HAV and those 
without when one way Analysis of Variance was 
performed .

CONCLUSIONS 
 
When a plantar weight-bearing scan of the foot is 
available, a reasonable estimate of the presence of 
bunion can be determined based on the relationship of 
the medial hallux to the medial foot border.  However, 
none of these variable by itself was able discern feet 
with HAV when evaluated via univariate analysis. 
Additional work is needed.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Data are available describing plantar loading 
planus and rectus foot types1, but little is available 
describing the loading of the healthy cavus foot.  The 
specific aim of this project was to compare plantar 
loading during gait for asymptomatic healthy 
individuals as a function of foot type (pes planus, 
rectus, and cavus). 
  
METHODS
 
We 
hypothesized
asymptomatic 
healthy 
individuals with pes planus, rectus, and pes cavus foot 
types will show differences in plantar loading. Sixty-
one subjects were stratified according to the resting 
calcaneal stance position and the forefoot to rearfoot 
relationship into pes planus, rectus, and cavus groups.  
Plantar pressures were recorded with an Emed-X 
system (Novel, Munich, Germany) while subjects 
walked barefoot at their self-selected comfortable 
speed. Five steps per side were analyzed with Novel 
masking software.  Peak pressure (PP), maximum 
force (MF), pressure-time integral (PTI), force-time 
integral (FTI), and contact area were calculated over 
ten masked regions.  Data were analyzed with a 
univariate 
mixed-effect 
analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA) model, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc t 
tests where significance was found.  Foot type and 
replication were modeled as fixed and random effects, 
respectively. ANOVA significance was set at p0.05; 
Bonferroni post-hoc significance was set at p0.017. 
 
RESULTS
 
Table 1 tabulates the results for PP and MF.  
Hallux PP and MF values were significantly higher for 
planus foot types.  PP and MF beneath the 1st 
metatarsal head (MTH1) in planus feet were 
significantly lower than both rectus and cavus feet.  
The 5th MTH PP and MF values were significantly 
higher for rectus and cavus as compared to planus feet.  
PP and MF was lowest under the lateral arch for cavus 
feet.  Cavus feet showed significantly higher PP at the 
lateral heel than rectus or planus.  MF beneath the 
medial heel was significantly different between rectus 
and cavus feet. The planus medial arch had twice the 
contact area of rectus, which had twice the area of 
cavus.   
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
In most plantar regions several measures of 
plantar loading were sensitive to foot type.  The lower 
1st MTH loads support the “hyper-mobile 1st-ray 
theory” where load is supported by the 2nd and 3rd 
MTH in many planus feet.  PTI and FTI corroborate 
this observation.  Higher 5th MTH cavus loads 
showed, as expected, differences to those of planus 
feet.  These data will serve as a reference for future 
investigations of pedal pathology as related to foot 
types, and for designing and evaluating treatments.

INTRODUCTION 
 
It has been suggested that foot structure may influence foot 
function (Song et al., 1996).  The aim of this study is to investigate 
the relationship between foot structure and function as a predictive 
tool that could be used to plan more effective conservative and 
surgical treatments of pedal pathologies. We hypothesize that 
measures of foot structure (hindfoot alignment and arch height) are 
associated with biomechanical measures of foot function in 
asymptomatic healthy individuals. 
METHODS
 
Foot structure was characterized by computing: (1) the maleolar 
valgus index (MVI) while standing, (2) arch height index (AHI) 
while sitting, and (3) AHI standing.  MVI is a measure of static 
hindfoot alignment (Song et al, 1996).  The subject’s plantar foot is 
scanned while standing on a plexiglass platform over a flatbed 
scanner with a custom-made jig to register the lateral and medial 
malleolus.  The deviation from the midpoint of the transmalleolar 
axis to the midpoint of the hindfoot, normalized to the foot width in 
this region, comprised the MVI.  Note that AHI is the arch height at 
one-half of foot length normalized by the truncated foot length 
(Zifchock et al, 2006). 
 
Foot function was characterized by calculating: (1) The center of 
pressure excursion index (CPEI - a measure of dynamic foot 
function), which is the lateral displacement of center of the pressure 
curve from the line constructed between the initial and the final 
center of pressure values, normalized by the foot width at the anterior 
one third of foot. (Song et al., 1996)  The emed X system (Novel 
gmbh, Germany) and custom software, developed in C++, were 
employed to calculate the CPEI.  Peak pressure (PP) and maximum 
force (MF) were calculated for the total plantar foot and each masked 
anatomical region using Novel software.   Temporal-distance foot-
fall parameters (e.g. step length, stride length, velocity, etc) were 
obtained with the GaitMatII (EQ systems, Glenside, PA).  Each of 61 
asymptomatic healthy adult test subjects walked at their comfortable 
self-selected speed across both the Emed-X and the GaitmatII 
systems to obtain the foot function data.  Each subject also was 
structurally evaluated with MVI and AHI (sitting and standing). 
RESULTS
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each combination 
of structural and functional parameter for the entire cohort. The 
results are summarized in Table 1.  MVI was significantly correlated 
with PP and MF at the hallux and negatively correlated with MF at 
the 1st MTPJ.  AHI standing was correlated with PP and MF at the 1st
MTPJ and negatively correlated with the PP at the 2nd MTPJ.  AHI 
sitting was correlated with double support time and velocity.   Step 
and stride lengths were negatively correlated with AHI 
sitting.  AHI sitting was correlated with MF at the 5th
MTPJ and negatively correlated with 2nd MTPJ PP and 
MF at the 1st MTPJ.   
DISCUSSION 
MVI was correlated with hallucial loading and 
negatively correlated with 1st MTPJ loading.  This 
finding is consistent with the overpronation that 
accompanies valgus hindfeet and a hypermobile first 
ray.  AHI was correlated with medial column loading 
as well as temporal-distance footfall parameters.  Foot 
structure is correlated with foot function and one’s 
basic gait pattern.

HUMAN WALKING: COMPARATIVE AND EVOLUTIONARY APPROACHES 
Human bipedal walking has a long 
and interesting evolutionary history.
Fossilized feet and footprints have 
played a prominent role in the 
interpretation of the nature of bipedalism 
in early hominins.  Recent discoveries of 
the fossil pedal remains of the Flores 
hominid (Figure 1), Ardipithecus, and 
ancient trackways have highlighted the 
diversity of early hominin bipeds and the 
mosaic of human and nonhuman skeletal 
features they possess.  Proper 
interpretation of pedal function requires 
knowledge of form and function in 
living humans as well as our closest 
nonhuman primate relatives.   
Figure 1: Late Pleistocene hominin foot from Flores, 
Indonesia (Jungers et al, 2009) 
Human upright striding bipedal gait 
is unique among primates and is 
associated with a distinct foot roll-over 
pattern involving heel-strike, lateral 
midfoot pressure, lateral to medial 
pressure transfer across metatarsal 
heads, and a toe-off with high loads on 
metatarsals 1-2 and toe 1.  Other 
primates exhibit higher medial midfoot 
pressures, higher lateral forefoot 
pressures, and lower toe pressure. 
The human footfall pattern is 
associated with specialized anatomical 
features including broad calcanei and 
distinctly robust fifth metatarsals.  The 
robust first metatarsal is broad dorsally, 
allowing a “close-packed” position 
during toe-off dorsiflexion rather than 
during grasping, and relatively short 
toes, decreasing mechanical work for toe 
flexors (Rolian et al, 2009).
Fossil hominids exhibit a unique 
combination of features.  The Flores foot 
possesses a modern lateral column but a 
short hallux, long lateral toes and a 
weight bearing navicular (Figure 1).
Our laboratory-based studies of 
functional anatomy in humans and other 
primates suggest that this hominin likely 
used a roll-over pattern resembling 
humans in early stance but similar to 
apes in later stance with medial midfoot 
weight bearing, a laterally-placed toe-
off, and lack of full extension or high 
loads on the toes during toe-off (Figure 
2).  Analysis of fossil footprints provides 
additional insight into pedal function in 
early hominins when examined in the 
context of modern unshod human foot 
pressure.  Taken together, 
paleontological and neontological 
studies of foot function provide deeper 
insights into modern human foot form, 
function, and pathology.

presence of pressure in the midfoot, the high pressures 
on metatarsals 2-3, and low toe pressures.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In a previous pilot study of ‘cruisers’ (non-
independent ambulation), ‘early walkers’ (independent 
ambulation for 0 – 5 months), and ‘experienced 
walkers’ (independent ambulation for 6 – 12 months) 
developmental age significantly affected the children’s 
stability when walking and performing functional 
activities.1 The purpose of this investigation is to 
examine how shoe structural characteristics affect 
plantar pressure distribution in early walkers. 
METHODS
 
We hypothesized that torsional flexibility of 
children’s shoes affects plantar loading. Twenty-six 
children were evaluated in barefoot and each of four 
shoes that stratified a range of torsional flexibilities.  
The children were early walkers.  Plantar pressures 
were recorded barefoot and shod with Emed-X and 
Pedar-X 
systems 
(Novel, 
Munich, 
Germany) 
respectively, at self-selected comfortable walking 
speeds.  A minimum of five steps per side were 
analyzed using Novel masking software.  Peak 
pressure (PP), maximum force (MF), pressure-time 
integral (PTI), force-time integral (FTI), and contact 
area were calculated over ten masked regions.  Data 
were analyzed using a univariate mixed-effect 
ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc t tests 
where significance was found.  Footwear and 
replication were modeled as fixed and random effects, 
respectively.  Significance was set at p0.05 for 
ANOVA and p0.005 for the post-hoc tests. 
RESULTS
 
  Peak pressure (Table 1, N/cm2) for the right 
foot was significantly different across shoes for 
masked regions except the 5th MTPJ.  In general, the 
stiffest shoe (ST) had the lowest PP while the most 
flexible shoe (UF) had the highest; ST and UF were 
also the most dissimilar and similar, respectively, to 
the barefoot pressures.    Torsional flexibility (Figure 
1, deg/Nm) showed a decreasing trend with increasing 
torsion angle across all footwear types.  Highest 
flexibility was observed in the Ultraflex (pink line) 
footwear.

BACKGROUND 
 
Lower extremity overuse injuries are reportedly 
the most common injuries in the military. Extreme 
values of static arch height (Williams, 2001) and the 
heavy loads commonly carried by military personnel 
in training and combat environments are associated 
with an increased risk of lower extremity overuse 
injuries (Bisiaux, 2008). While associations between 
static arch height and plantar pressure distributions 
have been demonstrated (Teyhen, 2009), limited 
knowledge exists regarding the impact of load carriage 
on plantar pressure distributions in the shod foot 
across arch types as delineated by AHI. The purpose 
of this study was to determine how load carriage 
affects dynamic plantar pressure distributions during 
gait in individuals with varying arch types. 
 
METHODS
 
One hundred and fifteen healthy service 
members (97 males, 18 females, 31.3 ± 5.6 years, 
177.1 ± 7.0 cm, 86.0 ± 11.0 kg) were enrolled in this 
study. They had no current medical condition which 
would preclude them from carrying up to a 40 kg load. 
Static measurements of heel to toe length (HTL) and 
arch height (AH) at 50% HTL were obtained with the 
Foot Assessment Platform System (FAPS) (McPoil, 
2008). Arch Height Index (AHI) was calculated by 
dividing AH by HTL. Dynamic plantar pressure 
measurements were obtained using an in-shoe pressure 
measurement system (Pedar-x, Novel Electronics, 
Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) while the subjects wore their 
own combat boots. Subjects walked for approximately 
30 seconds at 3.0 mph on a treadmill under each of 
three levels of load: uniform without additional load 
(WB), 20 kg load including weapon, helmet, and body 
armor (20kg), 40 kg load adding weighted ruck sack 
(40kg). Load carriage sequence was counterbalanced. 
 
 
DATA ANALYSIS 
Participants were categorized by arch type based 
upon accepted cutoff values for AHI resulting in 28 
high (AHI > .267), 61 normal, and 26 low (AHI < 
.229) arched right feet. An average of 9.8 ± .6 
consecutive error-free steps were analyzed for each 
load condition. Maximum force (MaxF), force time 
integral (FTI), and pressure time integral (PTI), were 
calculated for regions of the plantar foot using a nine 
sector mask. Changes in each were analyzed with a 
3×3 repeated measures ANOVA across the levels of 
load carriage and arch type. 
RESULTS
 
There was a significant interaction between arch 
type and load for the MaxF (p=.001) and FTI (p.005) 
in the medial midfoot. Although MaxF and FTI 
increased in all regions of the foot with load (p<.001) 
regardless of foot type, the forces in the medial 
midfoot were greater in those with low arches. 
 
There was a significant interaction between arch 
type and load for the MaxF (p=.004) in the medial 
forefoot. MaxF was greater in the high arched feet 
relative to normal and low arched feet (<.001) across 
all loads. The reverse was true at the great toe region, 
in which low and normal arched feet demonstrated 
greater MaxF (p .004) compared to high arched feet. 
 
The relative distribution of PTI in the nine 
regions of the plantar foot increased proportionately 
regardless of foot type under all load conditions. 
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
 
Higher forces in the medial midfoot in low 
arched feet may be related to the increased surface 
area in this region or may represent increased 
pronation. However, the relative increases in medial 
midfoot forces in low arch feet did not increase 
disproportionately with increases in load compared to 
normal or high arched feet. 
 
Force distributions in the 1st ray differed based 
on foot type. Those with high arched feet had greater 
forces in the medial forefoot region, while those with 
normal or low arched feet had greater forces in the 
great toe region, regardless of load. These differences 
in force distributions may demonstrate different 
strategies to generate a rigid lever during toe-off. 
 
Regardless of foot type, increases in load did not 
alter the relative distribution of pressure over the 
plantar foot. These findings possibly indicate a 
negligible impact of loads  40kg on footwear and 
orthoses 
prescription. 
However, 
differences 
in 
dynamic plantar pressure during gait based on AHI 
were supported.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In 1999, the ‘Kidfoot Münster’ project was 
initiated. The main scope was to investigate the 
individual development of the child’s growing foot by 
assessing foot loading patterns in a longitudinal 
project. Over 100 children were recruited for this 
purpose. In previous reports we described preliminary 
results (Bertsch 2004, Bosch 2007; 2009, Unger 
2004). Now the first group of children has 
successfully completed their nine years of study 
involvement so that we can present the changes in foot 
loading characteristics of healthy children from the 
onset of independent walking to the end of their 
elementary school age.  
MATERIAL & METHODS 
 
As soon as the children were able to walk 
without support for several meters they were invited to 
the lab for participation in this long-term investigation. 
Between 1 and 10 years of age, they were asked to 
visit the lab on 17 occasions. Initial visits were every 3 
months during the first year, twice a year until the age 
of 6 and final visits were once per year. By the end of 
2009, complete data sets of 36 children were available.  
 
Dynamic foot loading patterns were measured 
during free walking across a capacitive platform 
(emed ST or X, 4 sensors/cm2). For each foot, 5 trials 
were recorded and stored in a database (Medical 
Professional 13.3.30, Novel GmbH Munich). Five 
regions 
of 
interest 
(H=Heel, 
MF=midfoot, 
FF=forefoot, HX=hallux, LT=lateral toes) were 
analyzed with standard pressure parameters (PP=peak 
pressure, MF=maximum force, CA=contact area, 
AI=arch index).  
RESULTS
 
Average peak pressure values of the total foot 
increased over time from 141 kPa to 409 kPa. The 
highest values were initially located under the hallux 
but moved towards the heel and forefoot. The relative 
maximum force increased especially in the heel (71%) 
and forefoot (87%) but decreased in the midfoot by 
63%. Relative contact area decreased markedly under 
the midfoot. The arch index gradually decreased by 
44% up to an age of six to seven years and then 
leveled off. The range of values indicates pronounced 
inter-individual differences (Fig. 1). 
Fig. 1: Development of the arch index between the 
onset of walking and 9 years of walking experience 
(i.e. 1 to 10 years of age); 3rd, 50th & 97th percentile.  
DISCUSSION 
 
With the presented data we are able to describe – 
in more detail than before – the development of the 
child’s healthy foot with respect to dynamic loading 
parameters. The results provide a range of normal 
values for the observed age range from one to ten 
years. These data may be used for clinical applications 
when potential pathologies in pediatric orthopedics 
shall be evaluated with comparable means.  
While not overthrowing previous knowledge these 
data provide a more detailed insight into the individual 
foot development, the range of acceptable foot 
characteristics in certain ages, and finally the time 
course for the developmental changes.

Introduction 
 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA is an auto-
immune disease that may affect various joints leading 
to 
specific 
malpositions 
with 
compensatory 
movements. 
Foot 
involvement 
is 
frequently 
encountered (Spraul & Koenning). A pronounced pain 
stimulus causes the children to respond with a pain-
relieving position thus causing muscular dysbalance. 
Children with oligoarthritis can partially compensate 
the joint problems in the neighbouring joints 
maintaining an asymmetric but usually fairly smooth 
gait pattern. In children with polyarticular arthritis the 
adjacent joints are also affected and compensation is 
hardly possible. Therefore, these patients may develop 
gait pattern changes. The present study evaluated 
characteristic gait patterns in these patients in order to 
evaluate the need for specific treatment.  
Material & Methods 
 
Forty-two children, 20 oligoarthritis patients 
(OA, 15 girls/5 boys; 11.0±3.5 years) and 22 
polyarthritis patients (PA, 15 girls/7 boys; 14.2 ±3.6 
years) were examined. Clinical and pedobarographic 
data were collected during inpatient stay. Every 
participant passed a clinical examination and the 
visual analogue scale was used to assess the current 
pain intensity. Plantar pressure measurements (emed 
ST 4, Novel; 50 Hz) were carried out with the 
instruction to walk normal at self-selected speed and 
recording a step in full gait. Five valid trials of each 
foot were stored for subsequent analyses. Dynamic 
foot 
loading 
parameters 
(PP=peak 
pressure, 
FTI=force time integral) were evaluated in ten plantar 
regions of interest. Forces were normalized to body 
mass. The averaged data of right and left foot were 
used for comparisons. The Mann-Whitney U-test was 
used for statistical analysis.  
Results 
 
While the maximum PP of the total foot did not 
show statistical differences, particularly higher PP 
were found under the hindfoot in PA children (Tab. 1). 
Furthermore, significantly higher PP in the first, 
second and third to fifth metatarsal head region were 
seen in PA children. The FTI showed higher values in 
the lateral and medial hindfoot and also in the third to 
fifth metatarsal in PA patients. The clinical findings 
indicated restricted dorsiflexion and plantarflexion in

Discussion 
 
 The present clinical data in PA patients indicates 
changes in the loading response and terminal stance 
phase. This can be considered as a potential reason for 
higher PP and FTI values under the hindfoot and 
higher PP under the metatarsals in PA patients. 
Polyarticular arthritis may cause higher  hindfoot and 
metatarsal loading as compared to oligoarthritis. This 
shows the need for preventive measures in these 
patients.

INTRODUTION 
Plantar fasciitis has been the third most common 
disease in runners, but its pathogenesis is still 
inconclusive. Changes in the longitudinal plantar arch 
and mechanical overload on the feet, have been 
described as risk factors for developing plantar 
fasciitis1,2,3,4. 
However, 
there 
are 
few 
studies 
investigating 
these 
factors 
during 
running 
in 
individuals with and without plantar fasciitis. Most of 
the literature investigated biomechanical parameters of 
the plantar fasciitis during gait and the results are still 
controversial, mainly because it is unclear the effect of 
pain associated with the disease over those parameters. 
Wearing et al. (2007)3 discussed that symptomatic 
individuals make some adaptations during gait to 
reduce forces over the rearfoot and, consequently, 
increase loads over adjacent foot areas, such as over 
the mid and forefoot, as also observed by some 
authors1,3. According to biomechanical studies, it is 
possible that the plantar pressure distribution in 
individuals with plantar fasciitis would be different 
during the symptomatic and asymptomatic phases of 
the disease, and the pattern could be even more 
different during running. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the association between plantar 
fasciitis and its pain symptom with the longitudinal 
plantar arch (LPA) shape and plantar pressure 
distribution during running. 
METHODS
Ninety recreational runners were studied: 45 had 
plantar fasciitis (PF): symptomatic 30-SPF (45.4±8.1 
yr, 69.6±14.0 kg, 1.68±9.2 m) and asymptomatic 15-
APF (38.3±3.3 yr, 72.3±10.0 kg, 1.76±7.8 m) and 60 
were healthy controls (CG) (35.0±9.0 yr, 66.8±12.0 
kg, 1.71±9.0 m). Pain was assessed by a visual 
analogue scale (VAS). The LPA was evaluated by 
digital photogrammetry during weight bearing static 
posture5. The index between 0.22 – 0.25 was used to 
classified the LPA as normal; < 0.21 cavus; > 0.26 
valgus5. The plantar pressure was evaluated by Pedar 
X system during running of 40 meters at a speed of 
12±5% km/h. Runners used a common standardized 
sport footwear. Contact area, contact time and 
pressure peak were evaluated in 5 areas: rearfoot 
(medial and lateral), midfoot and forefoot (medial and 
lateral). Groups were compared using ANOVAs for 
repeated measures, followed by Tukey post-hoc tests 
(p<0.05). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
SPF group reported mean time since onset of pain of 
7±2 months and pain levels of 5±2 cm. In APF and 
CG groups, the pain level was 0 cm. The LPA was 
more elevated in both groups with plantar fasciitis: 
symptomatic (0.17±0.08; cavus LPA; p=0.009) and 
asymptomatic (0.17±0.07; cavus LPA; p=0.008), 
compared to controls (0.22±0.05; normal LPA).

The cavus architecture of the LPA would lead to 
greater strain in the plantar fascia during static and, 
mostly, during dynamic activities, such as running. 
Chronically, these stresses will cause micro traumas in 
the plantar fascia and, probably, will lead to the 
progression of PF symptoms or even to the onset of 
PF. However, the plantar pressure distribution during 
running did not demonstrate association to the PF or 
its pain symptom. 
CONCLUSION 
The plantar fasciitis and the pain symptom are not 
associated to the plantar pressure distribution patterns 
during running. However, runners with plantar 
fasciitis with or without pain symptom present cavus 
LPA and more elevated arch compared to controls.

INTRODUCTION 
Displaced 
intra-articular 
fractures 
of 
the 
calcaneus represent a complex injury typically 
affecting middle-aged active population. The 
ideal goal of open reduction with internal 
fixation in these fractures is to recreate the 
calcaneus width, height and length, the subtalar 
joint congruency, the soft tissue balancing, and 
consequently the foot and ankle kinematics. It is 
not known whether operative intervention for 
these injuries provide any advantage to non-
operative management in terms of recreating the 
normal foot and ankle kinematics during the gait 
cycle. The current study was designed to assess 
the plantar pressure profiles of the foot following 
open reduction with internal fixation of high 
grade intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus.  
METHODS
The study sample included 14 operated patients 
and 8 control healthy subjects. Plantar pressure 
distribution was collected during walking on a 
level floor at a natural preferred cadence with 
Pedar-x system (Novel gmbh, Munich). 10 zones 
of the plantar area of the foot were defined. The 
subjects walked using the same shoe model on a 
level floor at natural preferred cadence. Plantar 
pressure data were collected over 4 cycles. For 
each step the pressure time integral (PTI) 
[Ns/cm2] was calculated for each zone. In the 
injured group, the sound limb was compared 
with the injured limb. In addition, the sound limb 
and the injured limb were separately compared 
with the control group (16 feet). Because some 
of the variables did not fulfill the assumptions of 
normality that underlie parametric statistics, a 
non-parametric approach was applied using the 
Mann-Whitney 
test 
for 
between 
samples 
comparisons. A p value of 0.05 was considered 
significant.
RESULTS
In eight of the ten masks PTI was significantly 
lower in the involved legs than in the healthy 
sample. PTI of the injured group was expressed 
as percentage of the healthy group. The relative 
means of the PTIIs of the involved legs were 
lesser in the medial aspect than the lateral aspect 
of the foot (MH-42% vs. LH-80%, MMF- 35% 
vs. LMF-103% ns, 1MTT-51% & 2MMT- 67% 
vs. LMTT-81% ns, 1TOE-23% & 2TOE-15% 
vs. LTOE-51%). Similar trends characterize the 
uninvolved leg. Thus, injured patients adopt a 
modified gait pattern typified by reduced plantar 
pressure, particularly on the medial aspect of the 
foot.  
DISCUSION 
Both limbs of operated patients demonstrated a 
similar PTI pattern of relative reduction, 
particularly in the medial aspect, compared to the 
healthy feet. The cause for this pattern remains 
unclear at this point. A potential explanation for 
the similar pattern of the injured and sound limbs 
is that over the years since the operative 
intervention and the rehabilitation process, 
patients may have implemented compensatory 
mechanisms in their non-operated limbs to 
prevent chronic over-loading of one side caused 
by gait asymmetry.  The observed symmetry in 
gait adjustment may be related to the self-
selected walking velocity chosen by each patient, 
and could indicate good functional recovery as 
related to walking. However, measuring at self 
selected gait velocities could potentially mask 
kinematical differences between operated and 
contra-lateral non-operated limbs that could 
emerge in higher locomotive velocities or during 
perturbations while running, walking on uneven 
terrains and side sloped surfaces.

INTRODUCTION:  
Hip fractures are regarded as the most common severe 
type of fall-related injury concerning elderly people 
and the most serious of the osteoporotic fractures 
because of their high morbidity, mortality and 
impairment in quality of life. (2-5). 
Pertrochanteric and femoral neck fractures of the 
femur, with respect to healing, may be regarded as 
fracture-types with long rehabilitation time. (1)  
Current rehabilitation protocols of patients following 
operative treatment recommend full weight-bearing on 
the operated extremity as early as possible. The 
present study seeks to highlight the reactions to early 
loading under the aspect of pain-control.  In-shoe 
pressure redistribution to provide relief of 
postoperative mobilisation is based on assumed links 
between pressure and pain. However, little is known 
about pain-associated loading after operative treatment 
of hip fractures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:  
29 patients, who had an operative treatment of a 
fracture of the femoral neck or a pertrochanteric 
fracture, were allowed to full weight-bearing as 
tolerated on the injured limb. 12 man and 17 women, 
ranging in age from 45 to 96 years, took part in this 
study at our center. During postoperative mobilization 
elderly patients were allowed to practise full weight-
bearing while loading of the injured limb was mostly 
limited due to pain in the early postoperative period. 
Gait analysis was performed by using the novel 
PEDAR in-shoe plantar pressure measurement system 
(novel GmbH, Munich, Germany). Computerized gait-
testing was performed at one, seven and twelve days 
postoperatively 
to
quantify 
weight-bearing 
in 
association with pain. 
Visual analog scale (VAS) score of pain were obtained 
from all subjects before and after testing with the 
PEDAR-system. Statistical analysis was used to 
analyze the relationship between the plantar pressure 
parameters and VAS scores in the period of 
hospitalisation. Pearson's correlation was applied to 
analyze the correlation between the changes in plantar 
pressure parameters and VAS scores. Statistical 
significance was set as p < 0.05. 
RESULTS:  
The average amount of weight these patients placed on 
the injured limb increased during the time of 
hospitalisation. During mobilisation maximum peak 
pressure (MPP), maximum pressure-time integral 
(PTI) increased at the seventh and twelfth day after 
surgery. In analogy, subjective pain scores decreased 
significantly during hospitalisation. 6 of 29 patients 
were measured at a fixed follow-up. For these 6 
patients the increase in the PTI and MPP values were 
statistically correlated with the improvement in VAS
scores (r = 0.8) in the course of follow up. 
The average load supported by the injured limb was 
70.4 (43.8-83.1) % of the uninjured limb after three
days, and gradually increased to 91.1 (75.4-96.2) % at 
twelve days.  
DISCUSSION:  
This study investigated plantar pressure related to pain 
during gait in subjects at different time points after 
operative treatment of hip fractures. Plantar pressure 
came up to 40 to 90 % of the uninjured limb. 
Furthermore, a positive correlation of gait parameters 
with 
the 
improvement 
in 
VAS 
exists. 
Correspondingly, gait and balance disturbances caused 
by hip pain have an influence on dynamic plantar 
pressure distribution. Our subjects presented a worse 
load distribution pattern during gait at the beginning of 
hospitalisation overloading the midfoot and the 
rearfoot. These changes could be associated with pain 
pathogenesis 
that 
worsens 
the 
biomechanical 
condition of these patients and their clinical 
consequences
CONCLUSION: 
Following operative treatment we recommend pain-
associated full weight-bearing on the operated 
extremity as early as possible to avoid specific 
consequences on postural balance control; the 
reactions to early loading under the aspect of pain-
control may provide a faster mobility after operative 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Foot morphology and plantar loading may differ 
between ethnicities (Veves, 1995).  Our previous work 
suggested altered loading strategies may exist between 
elite athletes of MƗori and New Zealand Caucasian 
(‘NZC’) ethnicity (Gurney, 2009). 
 
MƗori suffer disproportionately from diabetes 
and particularly its complications, including foot 
ulceration (Joshy, 2006).  If MƗori exhibit altered foot 
morphology 
and 
function, 
perhaps 
different 
preventative strategies are required for reducing 
diabetic foot complications in MƗori, such as footwear 
modifications. 
 
Therefore the purpose of this study was to 
investigate the static morphology and dynamic 
function of the MƗori foot in both healthy and diabetic 
populations compared to NZC controls.  It was 
hypothesised 
that 
based 
on 
previous 
findings 
significant differences would be observed between 
ethnicities. 
 
METHODS 
 
A total of 40 participants were further divided 
into 10 MƗori (8f; 42±11yrs; BMI 27±5) and 10 NZC 
(8f; 
43±11yrs; 
BMI 
26±4) 
who 
had 
no 
neuromusculoskeletal injury, plus 10 MƗori (5f; 
58±11yrs; BMI 32±5) and 10 NZC (5f; 60±10yrs; 
BMI 30±3) diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes.   
        Plantar pressure was evaluated using a Novel 
EMED-AT system (Novel GmBh, Munich, Germany) 
at a frequency of 50Hz during walking at a self-
selected speed.  Following familiarisation five trials 
were collected for each foot (Hughes et al., 1991). 
 
Static morphology was measured using Harris 
mat techniques.  Foot length, heel width, forefoot 
width, and arch index were determined.  The latter 
was calculated as the width of the narrowest part of 
the midfoot divided by toeless foot length.    
        Plantar pressure data were analysed using Novel 
software, in which the foot was divided into 10 
regions.  Multiple pressure parameters were analysed. 
       Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
tests 
confirmed 
data 
normality.  Independent T-tests were then used to test 
for significant differences between ethnic groups in 
both the healthy and diabetic participants (p = <0.05).   
RESULTS 
 
Arch index was found to be significantly greater 
in the healthy MƗori compared to the healthy NZC, 
but this difference was not observed when comparing 
diabetic groups.  No other static morphological 
differences were found between ethnicities. 
 
Few significant differences were found between 
ethnicities, healthy or diabetic, in terms of dynamic 
plantar loading.  Peak pressures under the central 
forefoot were found to be significantly greater in 
diabetic MƗori compared to diabetic NZC (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The hypothesis that significant morphological 
and functional differences would be found between 
MƗori and NZC feet was mostly proven incorrect.  
Since the compared groups were largely homogenous, 
we can conclude that MƗori ethnicity alone may not 
affect foot morphology and function in healthy and 
diabetic populations.  This may suggest that no special 
considerations are required when clinically treating or 
designing preventative care for diabetic MƗori at risk 
of plantar ulceration.  However further research is 
required on larger groups and non-urbanised MƗori.

INTRODUCTION 
The adjusted prevalence of diabetes among Native 
Americans has increased by 26.9%, from 6.7% to 
8.5%, between 1996 and 2006 (Jernigan et al., 2010).  
On average, Native Americans are 2.3 times as likely 
to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of similar age 
(Burrows, 2000).  Plantar ulceration is a common 
problem in individuals with diabetes. Among those 
with diabetes, 24% will require an amputation of the 
foot and/or leg (Lott et al., 2008). 
Peak plantar pressure and pressure-time integral are 
two variables used to screen individuals with diabetes 
and neuropathy for the development of foot ulcers 
(Brown et al., 2004, Sauseng et al., 1999, Stess et al., 
1997).  The role asymmetry in plantar pressures has 
not investigated in Native Americans.     
Our aim was to investigate plantar loading 
asymmetry during gait in Native Americans with no 
diabetes (ND), diabetes (D) and diabetes with 
neuropathy (D-NP).  
METHODS
Ninety-eight Native American’s volunteered to 
participate in the study (mean age 50.3 yrs; 19-86).  
Twenty three individuals had diabetes (D), 14 had 
diabetes with peripheral neuropathy (D-PN) and 61 
did not have diabetes (ND).  Neuropathy status was 
determined with a biothesiometer (> 25 V threshold).  
Twenty-four percent of participants were overweight 
(>25-29.9 BMI) and 59% were obese (>30 BMI).    
Plantar pressure data were collected using an 
EMED-AT floor mounted capacitance based platform 
sampling at 50 Hz. The 2-step method was used to 
obtain plantar loading data from five trials of each 
foot.  Each plantar loading trial was subdivided into 
ten specific plantar regions for analysis.  Differences 
in the absolute value of peak pressure and peak 
pressure-time integral of feet were examined across 
metatarsal regions using an Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA).  Separate ANOVA’s were run on peak 
pressure and pressure time integral for each of the 
metatarsal regions (alpha = 0.05).  
RESULTS
     Peak pressure asymmetry was different between 
feet across each the metatarsal regions 1-3 of the 
plantar surface during gait (p < 0.05).  Table 1 depicts 
the asymmetry in pressure-time integrals between feet 
across metatarsal regions of the plantar surface (p < 
0.05).  Post hoc comparisons indicated that individuals 
without diabetes (ND) displayed less asymmetric 
loading described by peak pressure in metatarsal 1-3 
regions and pressure-time integral across all metatarsal 
regions than those with diabetes (D) and diabetes with 
peripheral neuropathy (D-PN).

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Native Americans with diabetes appeared to 
show greater asymmetry in plantar loading variables 
across the forefoot region compared to controls.  
Individuals with neuropathy and diabetes had the 
greatest amount of asymmetry with pressure time 
integral across these regions.  Loading asymmetry 
may pose a role in the development of wounds in 
Native Americans with peripheral neuropathy and 
diabetes.  Further research is warranted.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is 
widely used to assess the disability of patients with 
multiple sclerosis (MS). The EDSS quantifies 
disability in eight functional systems (FS).  
 
The aim of this study was to obtain the plantar 
pressure distribution images in MS patients with 
different neurological status (EDSS) and to estimate 
the plantar pressure distribution parameters changes.  
METHODS
 
106 patients (33m/73f, age 39r10 years), 
diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (duration of 
MS 8r6 years) according to McDonald’s criteria, were 
examined. Neurological status of examined patients 
was characterized with EDSS 3.4r1.2. Patients were 
divided into five groups in relation to estimated EDSS: 
EDSS [1,1.5] (no disability), EDSS [2,2.5] (minimal 
disability), EDSS [3,3.5] (disability in mild to 
moderate), EDSS [4,4.5] (severe disability), and EDSS 
[5,6.5] (increasing limitation in ability to walk, 
walking assistance is needed). All patients received 
permanent pathogenetic therapy. 
 
Plantar pressure measurements were performed 
with emed-AT 25 system (novel, Munich, Germany). 
Five dynamic records of each foot were made with 
first step protocol. novel database medical was used to 
collect clinical and pressure measurement data. Peak 
pressure (PP), mean pressure (MP), maximum force 
(MF), pressure-time integrals (PTI), force-time 
integrals (FTI), contact time (CT) and arch index (AI) 
were calculated in novel-projects with novel automask 
for hindfoot, midfoot, five metatarsal heads (MH1-
MH5), big toe, second toe and lateral toes. Parameters 
were calculated for each subject and for five groups. 
The difference in pressure distribution parameters 
under the foot areas was checked with ANOVA. 
Significance level was set as p<0.001. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Each group had a specific plantar pressure 
distribution pattern that varied with a degree of 
disability status. The patients from Gr.2 (vs. Gr.1) 
were characterized with decreased MP under the 
hindfoot, increased MF and FTI under MH5 and FTI 
under MH4; increased CT under the foot and foot 
regions. Significantly decreased PP, MP, MF, FTI, and 
PTI under the hindfoot, MH4 and MH5, increased 
FTI, PTI, and contact time (% roll over process) under 
MH1, increased MF under the midfoot and AI were 
found in patients from Gr.3 (vs. Gr.2). Decreased PP, 
MF and FTI under MH2 were found in Gr.4 (vs. Gr.3). 
At the same time PP, MP, MF, PTI and FTI were 
significantly increased under MH4 and MH5 and 
decreased under MH1; MF and FTI were decreased 
under the midfoot together with AI and reached the 
values comparable with parameters from Gr.2. 
Significant decrease of PP, MP, MF under MH2, 
MH3, MH4 and midfoot, decreased AI, increased FTI 
and PTI under MH1 were found in Gr.5 (vs. Gr.4) in 
concert with significant increase of CT under the foot 
and all foot regions.  
 
Medial shift of loading is comprehensible 
because the first ray is the most appropriate structure 
used in weight bearing to provide an additional 
security. Reduced parameters under the second and 
third metatarsal heads can be explained with the 
development of the transverse arch in the forefoot with 
an increase of spasticity. Lower loading of midfoot 
(with decreased arch index) is supposed to be because 
of an increase of longitudinal arch height. The 
hindfoot off-loading could be a sequence of the foot 
circumduction and inversion during the gait. First 
signs of significant changes of all parameters occurred 
in MS patients with moderate disability can be 
regarded as a result of disability in several function 
systems. 
CONCLUSION 
 
These results confirmed that patients with 
minimal disability have minimal gait impairments. 
Patients with mild and moderate disability reveal the 
changes in decreasing hindfoot and lateral forefoot 
loading with medial shift of loading. MS patients with 
severe disability showed decreased parameters in 
central forefoot. Patients with limited ability to walk 
have stable pathologically changed plantar pressure 
distribution pattern characterized with low values of 
all parameters and significantly decreased loading of 
hindfoot, midfoot, forefoot with medial shift of 
loading.

INTRODUCTION 
The transition from standing posture to cyclic 
walking is a special challenge to be mastered by 
young children. It is the result of anticipatory postural 
adjustments before stepping. Studies on this matter 
with children have focused on force plate data and 
electromyographic responses (Stackhouse et al., 2007; 
Wicart et al., 2006) in clinical contexts. The aim of 
this study is to verify whether gait initiation can be 
measured with the EMED system in order to 
understand the relative contribution of foot structure in 
this process. Besides, as the medial longitudinal arch 
of young children is in progress, the role of the 
development of foot functions on this process could 
also be assessed. 
METHODOLOGY 
Antero-posterior and medio-lateral displacements 
of the center of pressure at the foot/floor interface and 
the Chippaux-Smirak Index (CSI) were measured 
during gait initiation in 20 Brazilian school children 
aged 3.7 (±0.7) years and with body mass of 17.3 
(±2.3) kg. The dynamic data were obtained with the 
EMED-ST System (NOVEL, Germany), sampled at 
50Hz and foot indexes were measured with foot prints 
in bipedal stance. Three to five valid trials of gait 
initiation were collected. The children stood still over 
the plate and after a “go” signal they performed the 
gait initiation and continued to walk for about 6 m. 
The walking speed was freely selected by each child 
and all were barefoot.       
RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
 
The CSI classified of 80% of the children as flat-
footed (CSI ranged from 49% to 69% for right and left 
feet). The average displacements of the center of 
pressure 
in 
antero-posterior 
and 
medio-lateral 
directions relative to the plate system were analysed. 
The results of one child are presented (Fig.1 & Tab.1). 
At 70% of the stance phase the anticipatory behavior 
to the step begins. The range of COP_ML motion 
toward the stance foot is 9.2 (±1.44) cm, which 
represents 1.3 times the forefoot width, whereas the 
COP_AP range of motion is 12.6 (±0.,7) cm, 
equivalent to 0.80 times the foot length of this child. 
The maximum COP_ML and the minimum COP_AP 
motions represent the displacements toward the 
stepping foot and the backward direction respectively. 
It is interesting to note that these very small motions in 
the directions opposite to the step are insufficient to 
identify anticipatory behavior.

Ledebt et al. (1998), on the other hand, found 
significant COP displacements for children of the 
same age. Since both feet were in contact with the 
platform, the system could not quantify the loading 
shift from one foot to the other as gait starts, but it was 
possible to measure the dynamic behavior of the COP 
before stepping, which may be of importance to 
follow individuals with gait and balance disorders.

INTRODUCTION  
It is not widely known if foot static range of 
movement restriction influences abnormal plantar 
pressure distribution in patients with diabetic 
neuropathy, and thus be associated with higher 
chances of plantar ulcers occurrences. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the static active range of 
motion (ROM) of the ankle (AJ) and the first 
metatarsophalangeal joints (1st MTF), plantar pressure 
distribution during gait, and the relationship between 
these pressure and ROM variables in diabetic 
neuropathic patients and non-diabetic individuals. 
METHODS
Thirty six young adults participated in this study: 
control group (CG, n=18, 43±9yrs) and diabetic 
neuropathic group (NG, n=18, 57±4yrs), matched in 
body mass (p=.10), height (p=.98), but not in age 
(p<.01). Static active ROM of the 1st MTF and AJ 
joints were measured in sagittal plane using a manual 
goniometer and an electrogoniometer, respectively. 
Plantar pressure (Pedar X system, Novel) was 
analyzed during barefoot walking with antiskid socks, 
in 5 areas: rearfoot, midfoot, lateral and medial 
forefoot and hallux. General linear model for repeated 
measures ANOVAs were used to compare groups in 
the studied areas. ROM of both joints were compared 
between groups using t test. Pearson coefficients were 
calculated to test correlation between ROM and 
pressure variables in both groups. 
RESULTS
NG presented smaller 1st MTF and AJ ROMs (table 
1), smaller contact area at the rearfoot, higher 
pressure-time integral at the rearfoot, and smaller peak 
pressure at the hallux (table 2). There was a moderate 
and significant correlation between pressure-time 
integral at the hallux and 1st MTF ROM (r=.44, 
p=.06), and between pressure-time integral at the 
rearfoot and 1st MTF ROM (r=.48, p=.04) in the NG, 
but not in CG.

DISCUSSION 
The results demonstrated that the 1st MTP motion 
restriction play an important role in NG patients by 
changing the foot rollover mechanism during gait, and 
consequently the plantar pressure, particularly at the 
hallux. This may explain the lower pressures at the 
hallux and the increased pressure-time integral at 
rearfoot in diabetic subjects. These findings are in 
accordance with other authors that had also described 
the same trend and suggested that the neuropathy 
influences the loading and patterns of walking (Turner 
et al, 2007). Nurse and Nigg (2001) found that peak 
pressure and pressure-time integral were significantly 
higher in areas of normal sensitivity and lower at the 
insensate areas, and the center of pressure (COP) 
under the foot shifted away from areas of decreased 
sensitivity when sensory input is reduced from a 
portion of the foot. Sacco et al (2009a) found 
reduction of peak pressure at the hallux during gait in 
neuropathic patients wearing shoes. Giacomozzi and 
Caselli (2002) found that, in this population, the COP 
excursion was shorter longitudinally, so the metatarsal 
heads left the floor earlier in the stance phase. Sacco et 
al (2009b) studied this altered foot rollover and argued 
that it was associated with less dynamic mobility and 
altered plantar pressure distribution. Our results 
confirm that an altered ROM, especially at the hallux, 
can produce alterations in pressures, potentially 
increasing the risk of ulcer formation. 
CONCLUSION 
In clinical practice, we could use this non-
sophisticated measuring tool (1st MTF ROM by 
manual goniometer) to predict a potential pressure 
alteration in neuropathic patients during walking. This 
ROM alteration would indicate a condition more 
susceptible to injuries and plantar ulcerations.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Total contact casting (TCC) is a common off-
loading strategy in individuals with plantar ulcers 
secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral 
neuropathy (PN).  Cast-boot ankle-foot orthoses 
(AFO) may offer a lower-cost alternative to TCC. 
 
The purpose of this analysis was to assess the 
off-loading capabilities of the cast-boot AFO by 
comparing the plantar loading patterns in TCC and 
AFO for subjects with DM, PN, and plantar ulcers.  
Specifically, we assessed the reduction in plantar loads 
in the hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot in each off-
loading device compared to unshod walking. 
METHODS
 
Twenty-three subjects with DM, PN, and a 
plantar ulcer gave informed consent and were  
randomly assigned to off-loading treatment with either 
TCC (n=11) or AFO (n=12).  Subjects first walked 
unshod across an EMED pressure platform (Novel 
Inc., St. Paul, MN).  Next, subjects walked across a 6-
meter walkway at preferred walking speed with a 
Novel Pedar pressure insole (Novel Inc., St. Paul, 
MN) placed in the off-loading device (TCC or AFO) 
on the ulcerated foot.  The EMED trials effectively 
created an individualized “baseline” value for 
comparison with each subject’s TCC or AFO trial. 
 
For both Pedar and EMED trials, the plantar 
pressure map was divided into 3 masks reflecting the 
hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. Multiple steps were 
averaged on each subject’s ulcerated side for contact 
area [cm2], contact time [ms], maximum force [N], 
peak pressure [N/cm2], force-time integral [N*s], and 
pressure-time integral [N*s/cm2].  The effects of TCC 
and AFO were assessed using analysis of covariance, 
with walking speed and the EMED value of the 
outcome variable included as covariates. Mean values 
for TCC and AFO are reported as estimated marginal 
means in order to account for variability due to 
walking speed and EMED values. 
RESULTS
 
No differences in estimated marginal means 
were found in the hindfoot mask, though there was a 
trend towards higher force-time integral in the AFO 
condition compared to TCC (p=0.071).   Similarly, no 
differences were found in the midfoot mask, though 
there was a trend towards higher peak pressure in the 
TCC condition compared to AFO (p=0.052). 
 
In the forefoot mask, the AFO showed greater 
off-loading capability for force and pressure-related 
outcomes.  The TCC condition had significantly 
higher estimated marginal means than the AFO 
condition for maximum force (p=0.012) and force-
time integral (p=0.010). Similarly, the TCC condition 
had significantly higher values compared to the AFO 
condition for peak pressure (p=0.011) and pressure-
time integral (p=0.007).   
 
Results are summarized in Table 1 below. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The cast-boot AFO yielded significantly greater 
reductions in force and pressure variables in the 
forefoot region of individuals with DM, PN, and 
plantar ulcers, suggesting that AFO may provide a 
viable, low-cost off-loading strategy for forefoot 
ulcers.  Further research is needed to determine 
whether the load reductions seen in AFO correspond 
to improved healing rates.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE 
Ankle foot orthotics are often prescribed to individuals 
with hemiplegia to assist with ambulation.1 Gait speed 
has been used as a primary indicator of orthotic 
effectiveness, and improved functional ambulation.2 
Limited research has been conducted to understand the 
specific mechanisms leading to improved gait speed 
after orthotic intervention. Changes in impulse during 
the first rocker (braking force) and third rocker 
(propulsion force) may directly affect changes in gait 
speed after othotic intervention.3 Therefore the 
purpose of this investigation was to objectively 
measure changes in impulse during double support 
and correlate those finding to changes in gait speed 
with and without AFO in individuals with hemiplegia. 
 
METHODS
 
SUBJECTS: Fifteen individuals with hemiplegia 
(age 51 ± 12 y, height 1.72 ± 12.2 m, mass 85 ± 21 kg) 
greater than six months currently using an AFO during 
ambulation.   
 
PROCEDURES: Subjects performed 10 walking 
trials at a self-selected pace in two conditions, with 
and without AFO. During all walking trials, foot 
pressure data was collected using the Pedar®-x Expert 
System (Novel Electronics Inc., St Paul, MN, USA).  
The main outcome measures were gait cycle time 
(sec), mean force (bodyweights), and impulse (mean 
force x time) in the, wholefoot, hindfoot (heel and 
arch) and forefoot (metatarsal heads, toes, and hallux), 
during initial double support (IDS) and terminal 
double support (TDS). 
 
 
ANALYSIS: Wholefoot, hindfoot, and forefoot 
impulse were calculated in custom Matlab programs 
by integrating the local forces under specific 
anatomical regions during IDS and TDS. Independent 
sample t-tests were used to test for significant 
differences with and without AFO (p0.05). 
RESULTS
 
Gait cycle timing significantly decreased with 
the AFO during the entire gait cycle (p=0.034), initial 
double support (IDS; p=0.034), single support (SS; 
p=.030), and terminal double support (TDS; p=0.048). 
During IDS, impulse on the affected limb significantly 
decreased in the wholefoot (with 0.052±0.016, without 
0.086±0.57; p=0.016) and hindfoot (with 0.037±0.012, 
without 
0.060±0.032; 
p=0.006), 
and 
remained 
relatively 
unchanged 
in 
the 
forefoot 
(with 
0.016±0.007, without 0.025±0.027; p=0.14). Mean 
force during IDS on the affected limb also 
significantly decreased in the wholefoot (p=0.0029) 
and hindfoot (p=0.0069). During IDS, hindfoot 
impulse % change and velocity % change during a 
two-minute 
walk 
were 
significantly 
correlated 
(R2=0.44, p=0.007, figure 1). During TDS, impulse on 
the affected limb was not significantly different in the 
wholefoot, hindfoot or forefoot (with 0.062±0.020, 
without 0.069±0.026; p=0.37). Mean force during 
TDS on the affected limb significantly increased in the 
wholefoot 
(p=0.0002) 
and 
remained 
relatively 
unchanged in the forefoot (with 0.30±0.11, without 
0.27±0.10; p=0.28).  
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Researchers have shown orthotics increase gait 
speed; this research suggests that the increase in speed 
is not due to increased propulsive forces at the end of 
TDS, but due to decreased breaking forces during IDS. 
The AFO provides increased dorsiflexion at footstrike 
creating a decreased impulse (breaking force) in the 
hindfoot thereby preserving the first ankle rocker and 
providing a more efficient weight acceptance and 
positively affected gait speed. Future research is 
required 
to 
fully 
understand 
the 
mechanisms 
underlying the increases in gait speed associated with 
orthotic intervention in adults with hemiplegia.

INTRODUCTION: 
A customized dynamic pedorthosis has been 
developed to prevent recurrence of the treated 
clubfoot. This new pedorthosis was developed using 
our OrthoticPro™, a software package that utilizes 
dynamic plantar pressure data, and computer aided 
engineering tools. The pedorthosis is constructed 
using rapid prototyping technologies (RP).  The 
purpose of this research was to: 1) compare the 
pressure metrics between barefoot in regular shoes and 
the pedorthosis, 2) quantify the deviation of the center 
of pressure (COP) trajectory from the normal 
trajectory with and without the use of the pedorthosis, 
and 3) develop a FEA model to predict this 
effectiveness of wedges. 
METHODS:
Five typically developing children (average age 
7.2 years, 2 girls and 3 boys) and five clubfoot patients 
with (average age 6 years 1 girl and 4 boys) were 
recruited. The finite element model was generated 
using CT based geometry and plantar pressure (Emed, 
Novel Inc., MN). The pedorthosis was constructed 
from the CAD model and manufactured using the RP 
(Stereolitography). Eight-pedorthtoses were fitted to 
the children with clubfoot and the children were 
measured during walking with and without orthotics 
using the Pedar insole pressure system (Novel Inc., 
MN). 
RESULTS: 
There was significant reduction of the average 
COP deviation following the use of the pedorthosis. 
The maximum reduction of the average COP deviation 
occurred in the forefoot (7.87%) and then the midfoot 
(4.00%). There are no significant differences of any 
pressure measurements at the midfoot, medial 
forefoot, and entire toes. Significant reduction of 
maximal force, peak pressure, and loading at the heel 
and the lateral forefoot are identified following the use 
of the new pedorthosis (P<0.05) (Figure 1). 
DISCUSSION: 
This kinetic change may imply a reduced 
supination of the forefoot in children with residual 
clubfoot. Our short-term follow-up demonstrates that 
the pedorthosis improves the dynamic misalignments 
in the residual clubfoot. A customized wedge as 
predicted by FEA indicates a corrective magnitude of 
the wedge angle which varies along the forefoot and 
midfoot regions.

Introduction
 
In the literature the effect of insoles is discussed 
controversial 1, 2, 3. The aim of our study was firstly to 
find a correlation between kinematic, kinetic and 
electromyographic changes during gait caused by the 
application of different insoles. Secondly we were 
interested in the change of the intraarticular force in 
the knee and the change of muscle forces in the leg. 
Methods
 
We examined 10 healthy subjects using 5 
different insoles alternatively with a neutral insole. 
The kinematic measurements were performed with a 
Vicon MX System (6 Cameras). Additionally we used 
an AMTI force platform and a Novel SF pressure 
measurement System, even though a Pedar (Novel) 
insole pressure measurement system. The EMG was 
measured with a MegaWin system, synchronized with 
the Vicon system. The intraarticular reaction forces in 
the medial and the lateral compartment oft the knee 
were calculated with the help of a finite element 
model (ANSYS) of the leg which is considered as a 
rough estimate based on CT Scans. The muscle forces 
were determined using a slightly modified model from 
the 
repository 
AMMRV1.1 
of 
ANYBODY 
TECHNOLOGY (Vaughan). 
Results
 
Opposite to the literature we found that there is, 
for some kinematic parameters, a more or less unique 
change due to different insoles. The insoles with a 
medial wedge, for example, showed a significant 
decrease of eversion of the hindfoot and the insoles 
with a lateral wedge showed a significant increase of 
eversion. A more interesting result was the calculation 
of the intraarticular reaction force in the medial and 
lateral compartment of our knee model. In figure 1 the 
pink curve shows the reaction force in the lateral knee 
compartment in % Bodyweight with an insole with a 
medial wedge. Nearly the same curve (blue line) 
shows the measurement with a neutral insole. A 
significant decreased reaction force could only be 
observed when we simulated a stiff ankle joint that 
means inversion and eversion of the ankle joint was 
excluded in our simulation. 
Using our muscle model we found no significant 
change of muscle forces in the whole leg. Opposite to 
that we found a significant increase of all thigh 
extensors comparing barefoot gait with gait in shoes 
with neutral insoles.

DISCUSSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
 
The 
findings 
concerning 
the 
kinematic 
parameters  of the ankle joint confirm more or less the 
clinical assumptions. But the clinical conclusion, that 
the changing of these parameters influence the 
reaction forces in the knee, could not be confirmed 
without reservations. The results of our simulations 
shows clearly that the effect of an insole will be 
completely compensated by the ankle joint. There is 
no effect on muscle forces of the leg or joint reaction 
forces in the knee if the ankle is enough mobile. 
Because the muscle forces are significantly increased, 
when gait analysis is performed with shoes, in the 
future it will be necessary to do the clinical gait 
analysis not only barefoot as hitherto.

INTRODUCTION
 The differences of lateral and medial patellofemoral forces in 
different total knee arthroplasty (TKA) designs have not been 
extensively studied.  The purpose of this study was to measure 
the distribution of patellofemoral forces in native and TKA 
cadaver knees utilizing sensor technology performed in a 
simulated operative environment.  Currently the criteria for 
evaluating the success of soft tissue balancing in TKA involves 
only the surgeon’s observation of intraoperative patellar tracking 
during a passive range of motion, but no good objective measure 
of patellar tracking has been described.  We propose that the 
ratio of lateral to medial maximum force and peak pressure may 
be used as a surrogate marker for patellar tracking.  
METHODS
The patellofemoral forces of 6 knees from 3 fresh-frozen half-
body female cadavers (mean age 82 years) were evaluated with 
a capacitive sensor placed on the patellofemoral articulation in 
staged clinical scenarios.  The half-body cadavers were placed 
supine with the pelvis stabilized such that all study aspects were 
similar to an actual operative procedure.  The medial 
parapatellar approach was used and the patella was everted in 
the standard fashion. The sensor device, capacitive novel pliance 
system (Novel Electronics, St. Paul, MN), was sutured over the 
patellar surface and the joint capsule closed using 3 sutures.  
 Staged clinical scenarios tested were native knees (NKNP, 6 
knees), total knee replacement without patellar resurfacing 
(RKNP, 6 knees), resurfaced knee and patella (RKRP, 6 knees), 
resurfaced knee and patella with lateral release (RKRP-LR, 3 
knees), gender-specific knee with patella resurfacing (GKRP, 3 
knees), and gender-specific knee with lateral release (GKRP-
LR, 3 knees).  Maximum force (N) and peak pressure (kPa) 
were simultaneously recorded over a set of 3-4 ranges of 
motion.  Average values were compared for the medial and 
lateral patella compartments and for different clinical settings.   
     Component alignment, stability, and patellar tracking were 
clinically acceptable by direct visualization in all scenarios. 
 A student t-test with a pooled sample variance was used in 
comparisons, and the assumption of equal sample variances 
between lateral and medial sides was assessed using a F-test.  P 
values of <0.05 were considered significant.  
RESULTS
 Significant differences in lateral and medial force and 
pressure differentials were seen in most scenarios despite 
clinically normal patellar tracking (Figures 1 and 2).   
     For the native knee (NKNP), a statistically significant 
difference was seen between the lateral and medial 
patellofemoral maximum force means (p=0.04) at a ratio 
between the lateral and medial sides of 1.63:1 with a trend 
(p=0.11) in the ratio of lateral to medial peak pressure (1.80:1).  
For RKNP scenario, an increase in the ratio of lateral to medial 
maximum force and peak pressure means was seen to 2.86:1 and 
1.99:1 which was significant (p<0.01 and p=0.04).      
     For the resurfaced knee and resurfaced patella scenario 
(RKRP), statistically significant differences were seen in lateral 
to medial maximum force means and peak pressure means 
(p<0.01 and p<0.01) at the ratios of 2.75:1 and 2.57:1.  The 
addition of a lateral release in this scenario (RKRP-LR) reduced 
the lateral to medial ratios of maximum force and peak pressure 
means to insignificant ratios (1.46:1 and 1.11:1, respectively). 
     For the gender-specific knee (GKRP), a statistically 
significant difference was seen in lateral to medial maximum 
force means (p<0.01) at the ratio of 1.96:1, but not in the lateral 
to medial peak pressure means (1.33:1).  Addition of a lateral 
release to the gender-specific knees did not significantly alter 
the ratios of lateral to medial differentials.

DISCUSSION 
     Ratios of peak pressure and maximum force were increased 
in the lateral patellofemoral compartment on resurfaced knees 
which were not seen in gender knees.  RKRP-LR and GKRP 
demonstrated lateral to medial patellofemoral force and pressure 
ratios most similar to the native patella (NKNP).   
     The addition of a lateral release in conventional total knee 
arthroplasty can equalize the medial-lateral force distributions.  
    The decreasing lateral to medial maximum force and peak 
pressure ratios in the lateral release group (RKRP-LR) after 
TKA and with gender-specific knees (GKRP) compared to the 
standard TKA (RKRP) demonstrates that these ratios are 
surrogate markers for patella tracking due to the known effects 
of lateral retinacular release on patella tracking and the design of 
gender-specific knees to improve tracking.   
    Intraoperative quantification of force and pressure 
differentials would enable the surgeon to assess proper patellar 
tracking, giving guidance for using lateral retinacular releases.

INTRODUCTION 
 
High plantar peak pressure values (PP) in people 
with diabetic polyneuropathy are correlated with 
ulceration (Boulton, 1983). An additional parameter 
that is commonly used to asses loading of the foot is 
the Pressure Time Integral (PTI) (Sauseng, 1999). 
However, a recent study (Waaijman, 2009) found high 
correlations between PP and PTI; and suggested that 
PTI would be of limited additional value.   
 
Novel software calculates PTI as the product of 
contact time with PP in one mask (PTI_novel) instead 
of using pressure per sample. This is expected to give 
an overestimation of the true PTI. The Force Time 
Integral (FTI) is calculated using individual sensor 
pressures per sample. Therefore, a more accurate 
approach to obtain PTI per mask is dividing FTI by 
contact area (PTI_F).  
 
We sought to test the differences between these 
two calculation methods in different populations with 
and without diabetes and diabetic polyneuropathy. 
METHODS
 
Subjects were divided in a group of healthy 
elderly (HE), a group with diabetes type 2 (DM), and a 
group with diabetes and polyneuropathy (DPN). 
Subjects were asked to walk barefooted over a 
pressure platform at standardized walking speed 
(1.2±0.1m/s).  
Table 1: Subject Characteristics. (mean±std. Error). 
 
Data was masked using the Novel 10 mask 
division (1=heel, 2=mid foot, 3-7=metatarsal region, 
8= hallux, 9-10= toes).  
RESULTS
 
 Overall PTI values were lower for PTI_F 
compared to PTI_novel (PTI_novel= 9.1±5.4 Ns/cm2,
PTI_F= 2.6±1.1 Ns/cm2). PP and PTI_novel showed a 
similarity of pattern, but PTI_F pattern differed from 
PTI_novel, especially in the region of the hallux. 
Figure 1 shows these differences for the DPN group. 
To operationalize the difference between both PTI 
calculations, PTI of the hallux was divided by PTI of 
the heel. These ratios differed significantly (p=0.000) 
between both calculations in each group (PTI_novel - 
PTI_F: HE 1.17 - 0.81; DM 1.34 - 0.79; DPN 1.19 - 
0.80).

DISCUSSION 
 
These results show that there is a difference in 
PTI calculation based on PP and FTI, especially in the 
hallux. Because the PTI_novel is based on PP, the 
additional value as described by Waaijman et al. 
(2009) may be limited.  
 
In addition, when comparing groups, there is a 
similarity of differences between PP and PTI_novel 
(not shown here). However, the differences between 
PP and PTI_F show an inconsistency when comparing 
the different groups per mask.  
 
Based on these results it is concluded that the 
more accurate calculation, as suggested here, may 
contribute to better understand foot sole loading.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In the field of foot biomechanics, the clinical 
relevance of the integration of pressure, kinematics 
and 
force 
measurements 
has 
already 
been 
demonstrated (Giacomozzi, 2000). Previous work 
conducted by the authors in this field has been focused 
on two key areas: First, to produce a reliable 
combination of pressure instrumentation, a kinematic 
foot model (in this case the Oxford Foot Model 
(OFM) (Stebbins, 2006), procedures and software to 
provide automated masks for accurate pathologic 
footprint selection. Second to identify the most 
appropriate geometrical footprint selections which, in 
presence of regular footprints, compares reliably to a 
selection based on markers from the OFM.  Since 
kinematic measurements are not always available, it is 
useful to know which geometric mask should be used 
to allow comparable results. The present study deals 
with this latter aim. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Markers from the OFM were used to define the 
following 5 anatomically-based foot areas (Stebbins, 
2006): 1) medial hindfoot (MH); 2) lateral hindfoot 
(LH); 3) midfoot (MI); 4) medial forefoot, toes 
included (MF); 5) lateral forefoot, toes included (LF). 
novel gmbh purposely modified the multimask 
software to integrate kinematic data from a VICON 
system acquired simultaneously with an emed pressure 
platform. As a result, the above areas were identified 
by vertically projecting the position of the relevant 
anatomical markers at midstance. Two automated 
masks (available in software) were found to be the 
most similar to the OFM based mask: i) BIS mask, 
based on the longitudinal bisecting line of the foot and 
on the two lines perpendicular to it placed at default 
distances from the bottom of the footprint (27% and 
55% respectively); ii) HT2 mask: similar to the BIS 
mask, but based on the longitudinal line going from 
the middle of the hindfoot to 2nd toe (HT2 line). Since 
the 
OFM-based 
selection 
uses 
two 
different 
longitudinal axes for the hindfoot and the forefoot, 
two further geometrical masks were created based on a 
mixed use of the previous two masks: i) MIX: same 
hindfoot selection as BIS, same forefoot as HT2; ii) 
MIX1: same hindfoot as HT2, same forefoot as BIS. 
Thus, 5 masks were applied in all to 200 footprints 
acquired from a young healthy population of 19 girls 
and boys (38 feet). Up to now, 25 different, randomly 
selected footprints have been processed. %RMSEs 
were calculated along the whole loading process for 
vertical force (F), contact area (A), peak pressure (PP) 
and mean pressure (MP).  
 
RESULTS
 
Very good matching was found in all the 4 
geometric masks with the OFM-based mask – 
RMSE<5% for F, A and PP; RMSE§6% for MP. BIS 
and MIX1 showed better results than HT2 and MIX, 
MIX1 giving the best results. MF was the most 
sensitive area as for F; MI was the most sensitive as 
for A, PP and MP. Table 1 reports the %RMSEs for 
MIX1 mask. Fig.1 shows the 5 masks on a regular 
footprint and the corresponding %RMSE averaged 
over F, A, PP and MP.

slightly higher than intra-subject variability.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The bones of the foot are largely supported by 
the soft tissue on the plantar surface, which acts as the 
interface with the ground (Tachdjian, 1985). Soft 
tissue stiffness could affect pressure distribution, 
shock absorption, or stability during gait. Assessment 
of soft tissue is important for foot structures that may 
be prone to increased stiffness such as in high arch 
structures that are commonly more rigid and less 
adaptable to the ground for impact cushioning (Van 
Boerum, 2003). Even though plantar stiffness has been 
evaluated using a variety of methods, there are no 
standardized methods to measure plantar stiffness that 
take into account the real-time, dynamic, weight 
bearing condition of stance phase of gait (Cavanaugh, 
1999 & Rome, 2000). Therefore, we hypothesize that 
this technique will be able to describe the changes in 
plantar stiffness during stance based on differences in 
arch structures. 
METHODS
Reflective markers were placed on the feet of 13 
subjects (age range 18-21) with no foot pathologies. 
Trajectory data were collected with Vicon motion 
capture cameras during sitting trials and while walking 
over a Novel EMED-ST/E pedobarograph (Munich, 
Germany). To model the stiffness of the soft tissue, 
force and deformation had to be isolated. The 
deformation was the difference in distance between 
the markers on the foot and the ground during sitting 
unloaded trials and during walking. Deformation data 
were limited to the time each segment were in contact 
with the ground and decimated due differences in 
collection frequencies. Force data for each segment 
were matched to the corresponding deformation data, 
and all data were inputted into the equation for a 
simple spring to model stiffness.
RESULTS
 
When compared to the low arch subjects, the 
mean stiffness values for the high arched subjects 
were greatest in the heel and lowest in the hallux 
(Table 1). The real time stiffness plots show the 
changing stiffness during the weight bearing condition 
of stance phase (Figure 1).

CONCLUSION 
 
This work demonstrates the feasibility and utility 
of combining motion capture data with pedobarograph 
data to characterize plantar stiffness during stance for 
comparison between arch structures.  Variations in 
plantar stiffness during loading and unloading could 
impact foot function and alter gait patterns, and 
therefore should be examined more thoroughly.

BACKGROUND 
 
Static measurements of foot structure have 
previously been used in both the clinical and research 
setting to describe and classify foot structure 
(Redmond, 2008). Attempts have been made to relate 
these different classifications to lower extremity 
injuries and to identify appropriate athletic footwear in 
an attempt to mitigate injury (Jenkins, 2007; Knapik, 
2010). Such attempts, however, have yet to yield 
consistent results (Barnes, 2008; Burns, 2005). Since 
the foot is dynamically loaded during gait and sport 
activities, it may be more appropriate to classify foot 
structure based on dynamic geometric variables. Prior 
to this application, the reliability of these variables 
must be established. The purpose of this study was to 
determine the reliability of geometric variables 
obtained during gait at a self-selected speed.  
METHODS
 
Ten healthy males (n=8) and females (n=2) 
participated in this study (age: 27.7 ± 4.1 years, mass: 
77.6 ± 10.7 kg, height: 174.3 ± 7.0 cm). Data were 
collected on two different days using the EMED-X®
system (Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany), with a 
sampling frequency of 100Hz. A two-step approach at 
a self-selected speed was utilized for all trials, which 
previously has been demonstrated to be reliable in gait 
analysis (McPoil, 1999). In order for a trial to be 
included the following criteria were met: only one foot 
contacted the platform, contact was made on the 
second step, subjects did not “target” the platform, and 
subjects appeared to walk with their normal gait and 
cadence. After familiarization of the task, subjects 
performed 5 right and 5 left trials. 
 
Geometric variables were then obtained through 
the Novel software package. Intraclass correlation 
coefficients (ICC) were calculated using a two-way 
random effects model (ICC [2, k]) and means and 
standard errors were calculated for each foot for 21 
geometric variables. 
RESULTS
 
Means, standard errors of the measurement 
(SEMs), and ICCs for both the left and right feet are 
presented in Table 1. Excellent reliability (ICC>0.90) 
was demonstrated in 15 of the 21 geometric variables 
for the left foot and 16 of the 21 variables for the right 
foot. Good reliability (ICC>0.70) was demonstrated in 
20 of the 21 variable for both the left and right feet.

between foot geometry and lower extremity injuries.

INTRODUCTION 
Alpine skiing has been characterized as 
particularly dangerous to the knee joint (Heir et al., 
2005). Many of these may be avoidable with a greater 
understanding of biomechanical parameters related to 
skiing technique and equipment design. Attempts to 
measure the dynamic forces transferred to the skier 
have been described previously. Only few have 
successfully realized a full six degree-of-freedom 
measurement system due to the high technical 
challenges 
implied 
(Kiefmann 
et 
al., 
2006). 
Alternatively, pressure insole systems have been used 
to collect data during skiing with different applications 
and studies (Schaff et al., 1989). 
The purpose of this investigation was to 
compare a pressure insole in combination with a 
pressure sensor placed inside the shaft at the anterior 
aspect of the tibia to the data collected from a full six 
degree-of-freedom force sensor mounted between 
shoe and binding. It was hypothesized that vertical 
reaction forces and the moment about the ankle joint 
can be estimated from pressure measurements. 
METHODS
 
Tests were carried out on two occasions on 
slopes of appr. 20° inclination. One subject performed 
various reference movements and relevant skiing 
motions including straight runs, short and long turns 
on a groomed slope. Secondly, six subjects performed 
runs on a mogul course. Skill levels ranged from 
advanced to elite. Two mobile 6 DoF force plates were 
mounted between ski boot and binding sampling to a 
biovision mini computer (500 Hz). A Pedar insole 
system (novel GmbH) consisting of an insole and a 
dorsal pad, sampling at 125 Hz was worn inside one of 
the boots. A synchronized video was recorded for all 
trials.  
RESULTS
 
During both, the reference trials as well as skiing 
on the slope and moguls, anterior shaft contact forces 
of over 80% body weight were recorded. During 
single legged turns this was up to 100% body weight 
indicating a substantial load being transferred through 
the shaft of modern ski boots. For a relatively upright 
posture vertical forces of up to 80% of the reading of 
the force sensor were registered by the plantar insole.  
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Results indicate a highly complex interaction 
between movement at the ankle joint, positioning of 
the body with respect to the ski and the transfer of 
loads through the boot-shaft system. It was thus not 
possible to get a reasonable representation of the 
vertical force by the pressure system. The combination 
of shaft and plantar pressure readings was used to 
estimate the anterior-posterior moment between leg 
and ski. In some relatively static riding situation the 
two systems were reasonably similar. It is thus 
indicated that the use of pressure inside a ski boot is 
not sufficient for characterizing the loads experienced 
by the body system during alpine skiing. However, for 
the assessment of boot fit, balancing tasks or 
biofeedback studies the use of pressure insoles will be 
valuable. Further, it might be possible to improve the 
pressure system setup by covering more area of the 
foot- and shank-boot interface. More studies are 
required to explore these relationships.

INTRODUCTION 
 
It is widely believed that plantar pressure data is 
susceptible to a large degree of intra- and inter-subject 
variability.  This reduces confidence in interpreting 
results, particularly following clinical intervention.  
There are now a range of pressure platforms available 
for collecting data, utilising a broad spectrum of 
technology.  Along with this, there is currently a lack 
of standardization in methodology for collecting 
plantar pressure data, and reporting of results.     
 
It is unclear how much of the variability reported 
in plantar pressure measurement is due to varying 
methods of data collection and instrumentation, and 
how much is attributable to real variation in the data. 
 
The aim of this study was to determine the 
amount of variability in plantar pressure assessment 
that is due to differences in the types of equipment 
used to collect the data.  This was achieved by using a 
standardised protocol, and comparing the results and 
the intra- and inter-subject variability from two 
different pressure platforms. 
METHODS
 
A Novel Emed-M capacitive pressure platform 
was used to collect data from 19 healthy children (age 
range 6 – 16 years).  In addition, a prototype, piezo-
resistive pressure platform (ISS), rigidly mounted to 
an AMTI force plate, was used to collect data from a 
different group of 15 healthy children (age range 6 – 
16 years).  Three footprints were collected from each 
foot.  Both pressure platforms had a spatial resolution 
of 4 sensors per square cm, and collected data at 50Hz. 
A 12 camera, Vicon (Vicon, Oxford) system was used 
to collect synchronous data from markers placed on 
the feet, according to the Oxford Foot Model protocol 
(Stebbins, 2006).  Co-ordinates from anatomical 
marker positions were projected onto the overall 
pressure map at a time corresponding to mid-stance, 
and used to automatically divide the footprint into five 
areas (medial heel, lateral heel, midfoot, medial 
forefoot, lateral forefoot) using a previously validated 
protocol (Giacomozzi, 2000).   The peak force and 
peak pressure for each sub-area were compared 
between platforms, along with the intra-subject 
standard deviations.  
RESULTS
 
Difference in the average peak force (normalized 
to body weight) obtained from each platform were 
minimal (Figure 1), (0.1-1.3 N/kg).  Differences in 
peak pressure were slightly higher, with the least 
difference in the lateral forefoot (27kPa) and the most 
in the medial forefoot (157kPa).  Differences in the 
intra-subject standard deviations were negligible in the 
peak force comparison (0.1-0.8N/kg).  Differences in 
the peak pressure intra-subject standard deviations 
were much higher (16-98kPa).  The co-efficient of 
variation for peak pressure was consistently lower for  
Emed.  The lower accuracy of ISS was partially 
compensated for by instantaneously calibrating it with 
information from the force platform; this led to 
comparable peak force data, but little improvement 
was obtained for the accuracy of the pressure 
measurements. These results suggest that comparable 
data can be obtained from 2 different pressure 
platforms when the methodology is stanadardised, 
however accuracy of the pressure platform is critical.

PURPOSE
 
While it has been proposed that motion control 
or stability running shoes are designed to control foot 
pronation, little research has been published to 
substantiate this claim.  Cheung et al (2008) reported 
that motion control shoes, in comparison to neutral 
shoes, reduced midfoot forces during running but 
failed to consider contact area acting on the midfoot 
while walking. We hypothesized that the amount of 
midfoot contact area, indicative of medial and lateral 
longitudinal arch sagittal plane movement, would not 
increase between walking and running if a motion 
control shoe was effective in controlling foot mobility.  
The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
change in plantar surface contact area when walking 
and running in motion control shoes. 
SUBJECTS 
 
Ten females’ subjects with a mean age of 25.5 
years (range 22 to 34 years) with no history of 
congenital or traumatic deformity or foot problems 
volunteered to participate in study.  All subjects ran at 
least 15 miles per week for the past 2 years and were 
fitted with new motion control shoes (Brooks Ravenna 
Stability) at the same local running footwear store.  
METHODS
 
Foot measurements previously described were 
recorded in weight bearing so that the arch height ratio 
(AHR), foot mobility magnitude (FMM) and foot 
posture index (FPI) could be calculated for all subjects 
(McPoil et al, 2009).  The FPI and AHR were used to 
determine foot posture with the FMM used to 
determine foot mobility.  Each subject was asked to 
walk and run in their running shoes over a 42-meter 
indoor runway while in-shoe pressure data were 
collected using the PEDAR-X system.  To determine 
the effect of the shoe contour on plantar surface area, 
each subject was asked to walk over the same distance 
while pressure data were collected while wearing a flat 
soled, non-contoured karate shoe.  For all in-shoe 
pressure measurements, the sensor insoles were place 
over a flat piece of firm insole material (durometer = 
58 Shore A) that replaced the original shoe sockliner.  
Ten consecutive steps from the middle 20 meters for 
the right foot only were selected for analysis.  Novel 
percent mask and group mask software was used to 
determine contact area in the following plantar 
regions: medial heel, lateral heel, medial midfoot, 
lateral midfoot, medial forefoot, lateral forefoot, and 
hallux.  A MANOVA was used to determine those 
plantar surface areas that were significantly difference.  
Based on those results, an ANOVA and Tukey’s 
pairwise comparisons were used to further assess the 
medial and lateral midfoot regions. 
Figure 1: MANOVA results for plantar contact area  
(1 = karate shoe, 2 = walk in shoe; 3 = run in shoe).  
RESULTS
 
The mean values for foot posture and mobility 
were: AHR = 0.335+0.018; FMM = 1.58+0.27; and 
FPI = 3.8 + 2.35.  Based on these measures only one 
subject was classified as excessively pronated. 
 
Total plantar contact area was significantly 
increased in the medial midfoot (p < .0001) when 
running in the shoe in comparison to both walking 
conditions (shoe & karate).  The mean surface area for 
the medial midfoot was 4.4 cm2 for karate walk, 7.4 
cm2 for shoe walk, and 22.1 cm2 for shoe run. Total 
plantar contact area was also significantly increased in 
the lateral midfoot (p < .0001) when running in the 
shoe in comparison to both walking conditions (shoe 
& karate).  The mean surface area for the lateral 
midfoot was 17.7 cm2 for karate walk, 24.3 cm2 for 
shoe walk, and 29.6 cm2 for shoe run.  
CONCLUSION 
 
The results indicate that motion control shoes, 
designed with a duo-density midsole and a firm heel 
counter, cannot prevent increased movement of the 
medial and lateral midfoot when running.  This would 
suggest that sagittal plane movement of the midfoot is 
occurring within the motion control shoe while 
running.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Plantar loading patterns have been shown to 
differ among cleat styles during complex sport   
maneuvers (Orendurff et al. 2008). The choice of 
footwear style, however, is often based on individual 
perceived ratings. The quantification of plantar 
loading patterns may help explain perceived footwear 
ratings during sports. The purpose of this study was to 
identify the relationship between foot loading patterns 
and perceived footwear rating.  
METHODS
 
Seventeen male football players participated in 
the data collection (age: 16.9±0.9 years; height: 
181.4±5.5 cm; mass: 79.8±10.9 kg). Each athlete was 
fitted with a new model of a noncleated turf American 
football training shoe (Nike Astrograbber). A flexible 
in-shoe pressure distribution measuring insole (Pedar, 
Novel) was inserted into the right shoe and sampled at 
99Hz. Athletes ran a slalom course, modified from 
Eils et al. (2004), on a synthetic turf field with rubber 
infill. Nine side-cut steps were collected and analyzed 
with separate masks (medial and lateral heel, medial 
and lateral midfoot, medial, central and lateral 
forefoot, hallux, and the lesser toes). The force time 
integral in each individual region was divided by the 
force time integral for the total plantar foot surface in 
order to determine the relative load in each region. 
 
Following the cutting trials, the athletes’ 
perception of the footwear was assessed via visual 
analog scale (VAS) where 0mm = none/worst and 100 
mm = complete/best. Categories included comfort, 
control, stability, traction, and safety. Athletes were 
also questioned whether they felt comfortable wearing 
and performing in the shoe at full intensity. One-way 
ANOVA was used to compare relative load and peak 
pressure between subjects that would wear (WW, 
n=11) and would not wear (NW, n=6) the noncleated 
shoe used during testing. Correlation coefficients were 
used to compare the relationship between pressure 
distribution and VAS.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
NW had increased relative loading in the lateral 
midfoot (p=0.002) and lateral forefoot (p=0.045) 
compared to WW. Peak pressure was significantly 
decreased in NW compared to WW at the medial 
forefoot (p=0.029). Increased lateral forefoot relative 
load significantly correlated to lower perceived ratings 
in control (r=-0.72), stability (r=-0.73), traction (r=-
0.60) and safety (r=-0.66) (Figure 1). The perceived 
rating of comfort was not significantly correlated with 
relative load or peak pressure measures.   
Figure 1: Relationship between visual analog scale 
and lateral forefoot relative load. 
 
The differences in medial and lateral loading 
between groups likely relate to decreased stability and 
control during the cutting. The subset of athletes that 
did not feel comfortable performing in the noncleated 
footwear (NW) may have been accustomed to cleated 
footwear which led to greater lateral loading. Medial 
and lateral loading patterns have been found to differ 
with foot type (Queen et al. 2009). Additional 
investigation into the effects of foot type on perceived 
footwear rating and plantar loading are warranted.

INTRODUCTION  
 
The crossover toe deformity refers to an unstable 
second metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) that leads to 
a progressive migration of the second toe in a dorsal 
and medial direction (Coughlin, 1993). The etiology is 
uncertain, but as summarized elsewhere (Kaz, 2007), 
it has been proposed that a long second metatarsal 
causes abnormal loading (i.e. increased plantar 
pressure) beneath the second MTPJ during stance 
phase. Over time, this causes MTPJ pain, agitation, 
medial collateral and lateral collateral ligament 
rupture, and toe migration. In the current study, we 
used a robotic gait simulator (RGS), cadaveric 
specimens and a surgical metatarsal lengthening 
process to further investigate this relationship. We 
hypothesized that lengthening of the second metatarsal 
would increase plantar pressure beneath the second 
MTPJ and reduce the peak pressure underneath the 
first metatarsal head. 
METHODS
 
Dissection, 
including 
mid-tibia 
transection, 
exposure of the second metatarsal dorsally, and 
separation of nine extrinsic foot tendons, was 
performed for six specimens. Elongation of the second 
metatarsal was achieved through transection, a 
custom-made 
aluminum 
support 
bracket, 
and 
aluminum spacers of varying lengths (control, 2mm, 
4mm, 6mm, 8mm). A robotic gait simulator (RGS) 
simulated physiologic tibial motion, tendon loading, 
and ground reaction forces (GRF) on the cadaveric 
feet. Stance phase was scaled to 10 seconds and the 
vertical GRF to half body weight. The GRF was 
measured with a force plate mounted to the RGS, and 
a Novel emed-sf pressure plate was mounted in series 
with the force plate. Custom pressure masks were 
created from weight bearing radiographs of each foot 
and used to determine the peak pressure (PP) and 
pressure-time integral (PTI) under the first and second 
MTPJs during gait. Statistical analysis was performed 
with a linear mixed effects model.  
RESULTS
 
With increased spacer length, PP decreased 
under the first metatarsal head and increased under the 
second metatarsal head (Figure 1). Second metatarsal 
PP and PTI were positively correlated with an increase 
in second metatarsal length (p = .0005, p < .0001). 
First metatarsal PP and PTI were significantly 
negatively associated with second metatarsal length (p 
= .029, p = .024).   
    
 
Figure 1:
Peak plantar pressure for one foot in the 
RGS; left: control spacer, right: 8mm spacer.   
DISCUSSION 
 
Our results support the hypothesis that second 
metatarsal length is positively associated with plantar 
pressure underneath the second MTPJ. Differing from 
the first MTPJ, the second MTPJ capsule and soft 
tissue structures are not designed to support the large 
stance phase loads. It is thought that prolonged 
exposure to the plantar pressures measured in our 
study would lead to the observed joint subluxation and 
dislocation seen in crossover toe patients. Overall, 
these findings give a better understanding of the 
mechanisms responsible for the development of the 
deformity as well as clarify controversial associations 
of the deformity found in the literature.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Chronic ulnar nerve compression is believed to 
be a primary cause of sensory and motor impairments 
of the hand, which is common among cyclists. 
Prevention techniques include frequently changing 
hand position and wearing padded gloves.  However 
to date, there has been no scientific examination into 
the effectiveness of these measures (Kennedy, 2008).  
 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
effects of hand position and glove padding on pressure 
over the ulnar nerve. Specifically, we considered three 
hand positions commonly used on road bicycles. We 
also compared gloves with either 3 mm or 5 mm gel or 
foam padding placed over the hypothenar eminence, 
thenar eminence and metacarpal heads. 
METHODS
 
Thirty-six healthy adults (18 male, 18 female) 
were tested (38.9±13 yrs, 74.2±13.9 kg and 174±9cm). 
A stationary cycle was adjusted to match the 
dimensions of each subject’s personal road bicycle. 
Subjects performed a series of trials in which hand 
position (Fig 1) and glove type were randomly varied 
while power and cadence levels were kept consistent.  
A pressure sensitive mat (229 sensors, Elastisens - 
FO44, Novel GmbH) was used to record pressure 
distribution over the hypothenar region of the hand. 
This region is where the ulnar nerve enters the hand 
through Guyon’s Canal and is most susceptible to 
external compression (Black, 2007). Pressure from 12 
consecutive pedal strokes were averaged to quantify 
both the pressure distribution and peak pressure over 
the hypothenar region.  
 
Three-dimensional images of the subject’s hand 
with and without the pressure mat were obtained using 
a laser scanner (Shape-Grabber Inc). These laser scans 
were registered with subject-specific pressure images 
to relate pressure profiles to the underlying anatomy 
(Fig 1). The compressive stiffness of the foam and gel 
padding was measured separately with a materials 
testing machine and a 15 mm diameter indenter.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Padding in the hypothenar region of the glove 
reduced peak pressures found in the no glove 
condition from 21-28%, with the highest pressure 
reduction achieved using 3 mm of foam. The foam 
padding/glove system was found to be ~50% less stiff 
than the gel, suggesting that better pressure reduction 
was achieved using a more compliant interface. 
Absolute pressure magnitudes were greatest with the 
hands in the drops position (128-168 kPa), which were 
significantly greater (p < 0.05) than those found in the 
tops and hoods positions. Pressure magnitudes did not 
significantly vary between male and female cyclists.  
 
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has 
measured high-resolution pressure distributions on 
cyclist’s hands while riding. The data obtained is 
important for establishing a quantitative, scientific 
approach to design interventions aimed at reducing the 
prevalence of hand impairments in cyclists.

Canal were observed with the hands in the drops and 
hoods positions.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Consider the scoring system in golf. On each 
hole, playing to “par” allows the golfer two putts per 
hole – a total of 36 putts over an 18-hole round, or 
about half the total number of shots allocated for par. 
Considering that players have 13 other clubs in their 
bag, and would tend to use most of them at some 
stage, the putter is the most often used piece of 
equipment that a player possesses. Whilst this 
simplistic logic may be an exaggeration for the elite 
golfer, data indicates that even at the elite level, 
around 38% of all strokes are putts (2009 PGA Tour 
data, www.pgatour.com)  
Research into putting performance follows 
the same common theme - players are separated into 
groups based on handicap level. The question of 
interest seemingly “how do the elite/expert/low 
handicap golfers compare to the novice/high handicap 
golfers?” 
All 
authors 
assumed 
that 
putting 
performance was related to handicap level. On putting 
performance alone this was not definitively supported. 
Also, the authors often analysed only putts that were 
successful - that is putts that went in the hole 
(Paradisis and Rees, n.d.) or stopped over the target 
(Delay et al., 1997; Haltom, 1994; Zafiroglu, 1994). 
However, these types of studies do not investigate 
technique differences. In contrast, Pelz (2000) points 
out that there have been many different putting 
techniques used by professionals over the years. 
 
The aim of the present study was to define if 
more than one putting technique truly exists in a 
sample of golfers of different handicap levels. 
METHODOLOGY 
A total of 38 players participated in the 
testing sessions. These players were members of a 
private suburban golf club in Melbourne and all were 
experienced golfers. The average age of the sample 
was 55.3 (±17.8) years and average handicap 15.3 
(±6.9).
Simultaneous video (50Hx perpendicular to 
line of putt) and pressure data (16 x 16 pliance® 
pressure mat, 50Hz, novel, Germany) were collected 
for each putt. The data collection process required 
each player to putt whilst standing on the pressure mat 
which was positioned on the practice putting green. 
Each participant completed five putts at a hole cut into 
the green 4m (13ft) away.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Combining the kinematic, temporal and COP 
data, 62 parameters were available for analysis. 
Players were not divided according to handicap, 
putting trials were analysed individually and all data 
entered into cluster analysis methods to define putting 
techniques. This allowed the creation of technique 
based on the movements exhibited by players during 
the putting stroke.  
 
For cluster analysis, the most influential 
parameters in determining cluster membership were 
related to movement of the COP in the medio-lateral 
direction (COPx), namely: range of movement of 
COPx in the backswing; range of movement of COPx 
in the downswing; maximum velocity of COPx in the 
downswing and velocity of COPx at the time of ball 
contact (this was the most influential parameter). 
Two distinct putting techniques were identified 
by cluster analysis:  
1. 
Less movement (relative to cluster 2) of COPx 
in the backswing and downswing phases with 
velocity of COPx at ball contact closer to zero 
(on average). Low COPx velocity. 
2.  
Larger movement (relative to cluster 1) of COPx 
in the backswing and downswing phases with 
velocity of COPx at ball contact non-zero. High 
COPx velocity. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Analysis of COP data is able to distinguish 
putting techniques in an amateur group of golfers. 
Cluster 
analysis 
methods 
allow 
performance 
techniques to be distinguished based on parameters 
related to execution of the skill, rather than handicap.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Patients with poor blood circulation carry the 
risk of decubitus since it is generally unavoidable to 
use various bed positions in order to treat patients. 
Several mattresses have been introduced in order to 
prevent decubitus caused as such. However, since 
there are diverse kinds of them and many different 
methods to use them, patients’ families and nurses 
experience many difficulties in selecting and using 
mattresses for prevention of decubitus. Therefore, in 
this study, the effects of diverse mattresses for 
prevention of decubitus,  bed positions and subjects’ 
body mass index (BMI) on contact pressures in the 
areas such as the scapula, the hip and the feet- heels 
was quantitatively measured, analyzed and compared 
with each other.  
METHODS
 
Experiments were conducted on normal persons 
with under-, normal-, and over-weight (5males/ group) 
who were free of vascular system diseases. In this 
study, a general mattress and four types of mattresses 
for prevention of decubitus (latex, bubble, alternative, 
and air mattress) were largely used and five different 
bed positions were defined as experimental conditions 
using three-step electromotive beds. (Figure 1) To 
measure contact pressures, a order-made pressure 
measuring system (bedsize, Pliance FTX, v12.1.36, 
Novel Gmbh) was used. The mattress and the pressure 
sensor were stabilized for around 30 minutes and an 
additional process for stabilization for 30 minutes was 
included after the subject was laid on the mattress 
before the experiment in order to minimize the contact 
pressure measurement errors caused by air movements 
in the mattress. The same processes were repeated for 
five different bed positions. Maximum peak pressure 
(MPP) was separately measured using the predefined 
mask on supine body areas.

RESULTS
 
In the case of flat positions, the result indicated 
that only the bubble mattress was acceptable to the 
subject with normal body weight, latex or air mattress 
to the over-weighted subject and only air mattress to 
the low-weighted subject.  In the case of the subject 
with normal body weight for 30o position in the head 
area, MPP lower than the reference value were 
measured in all the mattresses except for latex and 
bubble mattress and in the case of the over-weighted 
subject, all mattresses were usable except for general 
mattresses, alternatives, and bubble mattresses but in 
the case of the under-weighted subject, all the 
mattresses showed MPP higher than the reference 
value. In the case of 60o position in the head area, only 
the latex mattress was acceptable to the subject with 
normal body weight while all the mattresses showed 
MPP higher than the reference value in the case of 
both the over-weighted subject and the under-
weighted subject. In the case of 30° positions in the 
head area in the leg area respectively, it was indicated 
that only general mattress and alternative mattresses 
were acceptable to the subject with normal body 
weight while only general mattresses, latex, and air 
mattresses were acceptable to the over-weighted 
subject. In the case of the low-weighted subject, latex, 
alternative, and air mattress showed MPP lower than 
the reference value. Lastly for side position, all the 
mattresses showed results exceeding the reference 
value in the case of the subject with normal body 
weight and the over-weighted subject while it was 
indicated that alternative and air mattresses were 
acceptable to the over-weighted subject.

CONCLUSION 
 
Air mattresses showed generally even effects to 
prevent decubitus across all the bed positions followed 
by latex mattresses. It was indicated that decisions to 
use bubble or alternative mattresses for prevention of

INTRODUCTION 
 
Polliack et al. (2000) pointed out that measuring 
pressure between the prosthetic socket and residual 
limb could provide valuable information for the 
process of socket fabrication, modification, and fit. 
Previous studies have investigated how interface 
pressure distributions change as a result of prosthetic 
alignment 
(Seelen, 
2003), 
adaptable 
ankle-foot 
components (Wolf, 2009), and walking surfaces such 
as ramps and stairs (Wolf, 2009 and Dou, 2006). 
Prosthetic liners may improve comfort by more evenly 
distributing pressure at the residual limb (Boutwell, 
2009). It is also likely that changes in liner thickness 
will affect interface pressure. Therefore, the purpose 
of this study is to examine the effects of gel liner 
thickness (3mm and 9mm) on residual limb pressures.  
METHODS
 
Eleven subjects with unilateral trans-tibial 
amputations agreed to participate in the study and 
signed IRB-approved consent forms. Mean age of the 
subjects was 56 ± 9 years with at least 6 months 
experience using a prosthesis and all were able to walk 
without undue fatigue. Two Alpha prosthetic gel 
(thermoplastic elastomer) liners (Ohio Willow Wood, 
Mt. Sterling, OH) were tested. Sockets for both gel 
liners were made for each subject using a CAM 
system called Squirt Shape (Rolock, 2000) that was 
developed in our laboratory. All other prosthetic 
components were the same for each subject. The same 
certified prosthetist fit and aligned the socket to each 
subject. Subjects were given an accommodation 
period of at least two weeks on each prosthesis prior to 
testing. A gait analysis was performed with the person 
walking at his normal self-selected speed for each 
liner condition. Mean walking speed across all 
subjects and all conditions was 1.14 ± 0.14 m/sec.  
 
Prior to each gait evaluation, 6cm X 3cm 
pressure sensors (Pliance, Novel Electronics, Inc.) 
were placed over the patellar tendon (PT) region, the 
anterior distal tibia (DT), and the fibular head (FH). 
Pressure data were synchronized with the motion data 
to calculate gait cycles and recorded at 120 Hz.  
RESULTS
Data from nine of the subjects were analyzed due 
to incomplete data sets from two subjects. Peak 
pressure values averaged over multiple gait cycles for 
each sensor matrix were calculated. Peak values 
during the first 40 percent of the gait cycle and the 
second 40 percent of the gait cycle were recorded and 
compared between the 3mm and the 9mm liners 
(Table 1). A nonparametric Wilcoxon signed ranks 
test with a Bonferroni correction was used to 
determine any significant median differences between 
the peak pressure values for each sensor matrix. No 
significant differences were found between liners.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Median peak pressure values were reduced for 
both peaks over the PT and the FH with the thicker 
liner, although the small sample size may have 
contributed to the lack of statistical differences 
between the two liners. The DT peak pressure increase 
may indicate that thicker gel liners provide a different 
pressure distribution pattern.  Patient preference 
should be considered when determining liner 
thickness.

INTRODUCTION 
An understanding of the force and impulse 
acting on the key by the finger associated to the sound 
generated is important because it makes the difference 
between interpretation and pure mechanical played 
notes. Some studies have been made in order to 
determine the force applied on the key and the relation 
with the level of loudness and the type of finger touch 
(Harding  1989, Kinoshita 2007, Parlitz 1998), 
providing important informations in relation to  piano
(p), mezzo forte (mf), and fortissimo (f f) levels with 
staccato  and legato touch. In the present study, using 
pressure sensors applied on the key surface, we made 
an analysis of the relationship between the force-time 
characteristics and the performance of pianists playing 
passages of classical music. 
METHODS
 
Fifteen pianists (8 female and 6 male) with 
different level of expertise (from IP: winning 
international prices to TL: top level ) played the first 2 
measures of Schubert’s Wanderer Phantasie (4 times 
in ff and 4 times in pp) on a grand piano (Bechstein). 
They were asked to play with theirs best interpretation 
and constancy; the finger sequences (fingering) were 
identical for all subjects. Five pressure sensors 
(S2013, 20x45 mm2, <1,2 mm, 10-600 KPa, Pliance-
Novel) were attached to the most relevant keys and 
collected at 300 Hz. Video records were taken via 3 
Casio Cameras at 300 Hz for later 3-D analysis. Sound 
track was recorded via professional tools. 
RESULTS
 
Peak force and impulse were calculated for each 
sensor and for each repetition. TL subjects showed 
50% higher peak force in ff (9,6 N vs 6,4 N) but 
similar values in pp ( 2,7 N vs 2,6 N) compared to IP 
subjects. All pianists have a stable reproducibility of 
peak force as described by the coefficient of variation 
( CV 10%-20% for IP; CV 14%-27% for TL in ff and 
pp respectively).  
 
Indeed, very high differences were noted in the 
total impulses. Overall average values for TL subjects  
were 73% (0,91 Ns vs 0,24 Ns in ff) and 69% (0,33 1 
Ns vs 0,11 Ns in pp ) higher then for IP. Significant 
difference were also found in the CV of impulse 
structure (11%-18% for IP vs 33%-35% for TL).  
 
An 
efficiency 
index 
was 
calculated 
by 
computing the proportion of the impulse up to the 
peak force to the total impulse. This index reveals the 
capacity of the pianist to produce the desired loudness 
without exert unnecessary force. The relationship 
between this parameter and the number of touches 
played on each keys could reflect the stability of 
motor pattern and force sensibility of the pianist. Fig 1 
shows exemplary the difference of impulse efficiency 
between IP and TL pianist (sbj. 4 and sbj. 12). It easy 
to recognize that for almost all the strikes subject 4 
shows a significant better regulation of force 
production.

Moreover an analysis of possible relationships 
between the force produced during playing and the 
force capacity of the fingers was carried out by testing 
maximal voluntary contraction force of each finger 
under isometric controlled conditions.  
 
Sound characteristics were studied by acoustical 
analysis (Samplitude V7.0) and by a quality 
questionnaire administered to professional judges.

THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN RUNNING 
Daniel E. Lieberman (1) 
1. Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Massachusetts 
 
Ever since the human lineage diverged from the 
African apes, hominins have been bipeds of some 
sort.  Comparative and fossil evidence suggest that the 
earliest hominins were capable, habitual bipedal 
walkers but were also adept at climbing trees.  At 
some point, however, hominins lost the ability to 
climb trees very well, and became superlative long 
distance runners.  Comparisons of human endurance 
running performance with other mammals show that 
we excel at speed, distance, and the climatic context in 
which we can run. Further, human distance running 
capabilities far exceed those of any other primate, and 
they match or even surpass the best mammalian 
runners in hot conditions over very long distances. 
These capabilities raise several questions, among them 
when humans became long distance runners, why 
these abilities evolved, and how the evolutionary 
history of endurance running may help avoid injury. 
 
A review of the fossil evidence suggests that 
features which improve endurance running 
performance in humans first appear about 2 million 
years ago in the genus Homo, mostly in the species H. 
erectus (Bramble and Lieberman, 2004).  These 
features include changes in the foot (e.g., shortened 
toes and the development of a full longitudinal arch), 
the hip (e.g., expansion of the cranial portion of the 
gluteus maximus), and the head (e.g., enlargement of 
the anterior and posterior semicircular canals).  Many 
important adaptations for endurance running, 
however, are impossible to assess in the fossil record, 
and it is not known whether H. erectus was as capable 
a runner as modern humans. 
 
A review of the ethnographic and archaeological 
records suggests that the primary advantage of long 
distance running was for persistence hunting.  In this 
method of hunting, runners alternatively chase 
quadrupeds at a gallop speed, thus preventing them 
form panting, and track the animals (usually at a 
walk). Since quadrupeds cannot simultaneously pant 
and gallop, this form of hunting drives the animals 
into a state of hyperthermia making it easy to dispatch 
them without significant projectile technology, which 
was lacking until very recently in human evolution. 
 
Finally, studies of habitually barefoot runners 
indicate that the human foot, like the rest of the body, 
is well designed for endurance running.  People can 
run long distances at high speeds quite comfortably 
over very hard surfaces without using cushioned, high-
heeled shoes. A barefoot “style” of running typically 
involves a forefoot or midfoot strike, both of which 
generate no discernable impact transient because of 
increased limb compliance and less effective mass at 
the moment the foot collides with the ground 
(Lieberman et al., 2010).  This sort of light and gentle 
landing requires more calf and foot muscle strength, 
but generates less impact than heel-toe running in 
modern running shoes, and is presumably how humans 
ran for millions of years. Such insights raise the 
evolutionary medical hypothesis that more minimal 
shoes which foster a more natural, barefoot running 
style may have advantages over more cushioned shoes 
that facilitate heel striking.

INTRODUCTION 
Plantar callosities and ulcers are one of the main 
factors leading to serious complication in the diabetic 
foot. Increased plantar foot pressures are the main 
cause for plantar keratosis leading to foot ulcers in 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Common areas for 
ulcers are under the metatarsal heads and every effort 
should be done to reduce plantar foot pressures in 
trying to prevent callosities and plantar ulcers. 
Orthotic devices believed to be efficient in plantar foot 
pressure reduction.. In this study we present the effect 
of a novel orthotic insert that was designed to reduce 
the plantar pressure under the metatarsal heads. We 
hypothesized that with this special insert a reduction in 
planar pressures under the metatrsal heads will be seen 
compared to standard costum-made orthotics.
METHODS
Ten subjects were evaluated while walking (4.5 km/h ) 
with: a) standard costum-made orthotics b) newly 
designed orthotic. The newly designed orthotic is 
based on integrating metatarsal bar and a pad (figure 
1).  In-shoe plantar pressure measurement was 
performed using Pedar-x system (Novel gmbh, 
Munich). The data of four steps for each leg were 
collected for each measuring condition. The average 
peak plantar pressure (N/cm2) was calculated for 10 
zones of interest of the foot. The analysis included 
comparison of standard-custom made orthotics to the 
newly designed orthotic. 
Figure 1: The  newly designed orthotic 
RESULTS
The newly design orthotic reduced average peak 
pressures in the second and lateral metatarsals and 
increased average peak pressures in the heel, midfoot 
,1st and 2nd toes (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Comparasion of plantar pressure  
DISCUSION 
This study has shown that, on average, newly designed 
orthotic proved to reduce the plantar pressures in the 
2nd metatarsal and lateral metatarsal by 22% and 31 % 
repectively. Being the metatrsals the most common 
area for callosities and plantar ulcers in a diabetic foot, 
the newly designed orthotic may be efficient in 
prevent ulceration and to improve wound healing. 
However, the tested orthotic increased the mean peak 
pressure in the mid foot and toes by 22% and 36 % 
repectively. This redistribution of load may put in risk 
especially the toes. Frequent monitoring may be 
required in order to make sure that not only callosities 
and ulcers improve in areas where plantar pressure 
is reduced by this device, but also that new callosities 
are not created in areas where pressure is increased 
with this special insert.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Plantar pressure measurements have been 
established as a method for the assessment of foot 
loading and functional restoration of foot-related 
problems in adults and children. For clinical problems, 
the effects of conservative or surgical treatment can be 
evaluated with repeated measurements that may help 
to demonstrate the changes induced by the chosen 
treatment option (Rosenbaum 1997). However, several 
factors have been identified as influential so that they 
should be taken into consideration.  
 
For adults, gait speed changes may alter peak 
pressures and the regional load distribution but does 
not affect the whole foot uniformly (Rosenbaum 
1994). For children in the early stages of gait 
acquisition, this effect has not been evaluated yet. 
Therefore, the present study investigated how changes 
in gait speed would affect foot loading characteristics 
in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Twenty healthy children (11 male; 9 female) 
between 4 and 12 years of age participated in plantar 
pressure measurements at normal, slow and fast 
walking speeds. They were asked to walk barefoot 
across a capacitive pressure distribution platform 
(emed-ST) that was embedded flush in a 5.0 x 0.8 m 
walkway.  
 
Gait speed was measured with infrared light 
gates (AF-Sport Timing System, Wesel; 10 ms 
resolution) that were adjusted to the child’s shoulder 
height. After self-selected normal walking (n), the 
children were asked to walk slow (s) and fast (f) until 
5 valid trials from both feet were stored at each gait 
speed.  
 
Footprints were subdivided into 10 regions of 
interest: lateral and medial heel; lateral and medial 
midfoot; 1st, 2nd and 3rd-5th metatarsals; hallux; 2nd toe; 
toes 3-5. 
 
As dynamic parameters peak pressure (kPa), 
contact time (ms) and maximum force (% body 
weight) were evaluated for the whole foot and the 
regions of interest.  
 
The dynamic parameters were statistically tested 
by using the GLM (generalized linear model) for 
repeated measures. The level of significance was set at 
p < 0.05. 
RESULTS
 
The average gait speed was 0.77±0.07 m/s for 
slow, 1.20±0.06 m/s for normal and 1.65±0.06 m/s for 
fast walking. The contact time decreased significantly 
from 808±118 ms (s) to 589±71 ms (n) and 443±44 
ms (f, p<0.001). The maximum force increased from 
105±11% body weight (s) to 115±11% (n) and 
127±16% (f, p<0.001).
The changes were most 
pronounced in the heel and hallux but showed even a 
decrease in the lateral midfoot and forefoot. The peak 
pressure of the whole foot increased significantly from 
340±130 kPa (s) to 392±91 kPa (n) and 524±178 kPa 
(f, p<0.001), especially in the heel, 1st and 2nd
metatarsals and toes but not in the lateral midfoot and 
metatarsals 3-5. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The effects of systematically altering gait 
speed were demonstrated in children. Similar to 
the adults, the loading increase is not uniformly 
distributed across the whole plantar surface but is 
concentrated on the heel, 1st and 2nd metatarsals 
and the toes. The decreased loading in the 
metatarsals 3-5 that was seen in adults, could 
only partly be confirmed for the children.  
In conclusion, the results underline the 
importance to ensure comparable gait speed for 
repeated measurements in a clinical follow-up of 
single patients also for children. If this cannot be 
achieved 
e.g. 
because 
of 
age-dependent 
developmental phases, comparisons should bear 
the potential changes in mind that were 
demonstrated in the present results.

INTRODUCTION 
 
It has been reported that intense exhaustive 
running increased forefoot loading in experienced 
adult runners and may explain some foot/ankle 
overuse injuries (Weist 2004). However to our 
knowledge no studies investigated that topic in 
adolescent athletes. The aim of this study was to 
examine the effects of intense running to exhaustion 
(Tlim) on the in-shoe plantar pressure patterns in 
young elite middle-distance athletes
METHODS
 
Eleven male adolescent distance runners (age: 
16.9±2.0, body mass: 54.6±8.6 kg, height: 170.6±10.9 
cm, maximal aerobic speed: 18.7±1.5 km.h-1) 
performed a constant-pace Tlim at 95% of their 
maximal aerobic speed (17.8±1.4 km.h-1) on a 
treadmill 
(h/p/Cosmos, 
Nussdorf-Traunstein, 
Germany). 
 
Plantar pressure measurements were performed 
with one sensor insole worn in the right running shoe 
(Novel, Munich, Germany). 
 
Data were recorded first at 1 minute after the 
start (1 min) and 30 s prior exhaustion (max). A 
regional analysis was performed utilizing nine 
separate ‘‘masks’’ or areas of the foot (Groupmask 
Evaluation, Novel, Munich, Germany). 
 
Mean area (mA) and contact time (CT) were 
determined for the nine selected regions. In addition, 
the relative load (RL%)  was calculated as the force 
time integral in each individual region divided by the 
force time integral for the total plantar foot surface. 
 
One Way ANOVA Repeated Measures was 
performed and Tukey post-hoc analyses were used. 
Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Running time to exhaustion was 8.8±3.4 min. 
Between 1 min and max, significant increase in CT (P 
< 0.001) was observed in all regions except Hallux. 
mA (Fig. 1) and RL% (Fig. 2) increased significantly 
under the medial midfoot area. The other measured 
parameters did not change. 
The longer CT in fatiguing conditions may result 
from a reduced strength and stretch-shortening-cycle 
efficiency of plantar flexor muscles. In adults, the 
following over load of the medial arch of the foot is 
the first phase of a compensatory midfoot landing 
strategy (Willson 1999) and induced also medial and 
central heads of metatarsal harmful overload (Weist 
2004). Conversely no forefoot overload effect was 
reported in the present results for adolescent athletes.  
Then we may assume that the medial arch of the 
foot is a structure of primary interest to absorb the 
increased foot loadings in fatiguing conditions in 
young elite middle-distance 
runners. 
Therefore 
reinforcement of the muscles supporting the medial 
arch might be implemented in foot/ankle injuries 
prevention programs.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Biomechanical differences between healthy feet 
(pes planus, rectus, and cavus) and those with 
pathology (diabetic hallux valgus) may be related to 
their fundamental forefoot geometries. The specific 
aim of this project is to quantify and compare conic 
curve parameters among healthy and diabetic feet. 
METHODS
 
We hypothesized that asymptomatic healthy 
individuals with pes planus, rectus, and cavus feet and 
diabetics with hallux valgus will show differences in 
conic curve equation parameters.  Sixty-one healthy 
test subjects were stratified according to resting 
calcaneal stance position and forefoot to rearfoot 
relationship into their foot types at HSS.  Patients with 
Diabetes and hallux valgus were evaluated at TUSPM.  
The x-y-z metatarsal head (MTH) locations were 
acquired with 3D motion analysis.  A unique conic 
curve1 was fit to each set of points and its resulting 
equation normalized by the first term (see Figure 1).  
Parameters of interest were B, C, D, E, and curve 
eccentricity.  Data were analyzed with a univariate 
mixed-effect analysis of variance model followed by 
Bonferroni post-hoc t tests.  Foot type and trial were 
modeled as fixed and random effects.

RESULTS
 
The conic model did not significantly distinguish 
among foot type with the exception of parameter D, 
the x-axis scaling factor in the conic curve equation; it 
distinguished rectus from diabetic feet with hallux 
valgus.  As shown in Figure 2 several structural 
variables had significant Pearson correlations with 
model parameters; in particular parameter D was 
significantly correlated to most.

The geometric forefoot model was significantly

beneath the heel.  This suggests that simple models 
may be useful to differentiate normal vs. pathological 
feet.

INTRODUCTION: Nociceptive Capacity of a 
Plantar Irritating Stimulus (NCPIS) affects plantar 
cutaneous somaesthesia and influences kinetic 
posture by modifying control systems (1,9). This 
NCPIS doesn’t express itself like reason of pain in 
podiatrist consultations but affects the postural 
control [1].  To understand better the repercussions of 
the NCPIS on gait analysis, we analysed the 
relationship

L/MA and force: L/MF ; Fig. n°1) of 15 subjects with 
NCPIS (pathological: P) and without NCPIS (non 
pathological: NP). Nociceptive sensory of NCIPS on 
walking track (H) was reduced by foam (F) during 
walking before and/or on baropedography force plate 
(8). 4 levels of sensory information were applied: 
start walking (S) and arrival (A) on the force plate 
were delivered the same way with the tactile 
information: hard (SHAH), foam (SFAF); start 
walking and arrival on the force plate crossed each 
other (SHAF ; SFAH). ANOVA and Schéffe post-hoc 
tests were used to test the possible difference between 
P and NP for L/MF and L/MA.  
RESULTS: No significant differences were present 
among the L/MF: between P and NP (F=0.080; 
p=0.779), between H and F (F =0.1622; p=0.190), no 
inter action P/NP and H/F (F=0.513; p=0.674). 
Results were significantly different with regard to its 
L/MA: between P and NP (F = 63.90; p<0.0001), 
between H and F (F= 299.37; p<0.0001) and inter 
action P/NP and H/F ((F = 295.83; p<0.0001). Post 
Hoc test showed no significantly difference into P 
and NP when start walking was on foam 
independently of the quality of arrival (H or F). 
CONCLUSION: No modifications of L/MF are 
present because L/MF are modified when weight add 
up like the literature explain. For L/MA differences 
are observed. For P, arrival on foam reduces 
nociceptivce cue for NCPI (1,8). Their sensory 
information will come back as normal. Normalization 
of sensory feedback will be improving muscular 
responses (5,7). Their kinetic foot pattern will find 
back the pattern of subject to NP (no difference into 
SFAH, 5-6, 8).
Those results confirm the potential nociceptive 
capacity of the NCPI on postural control and posturo 
kinetic capacity.

INTRODUCTION 
 
This study was motivated by a demand to prove 
scientifically the fact that applying an optimum 
interlocking pattern to electrical beds can be helpful to 
prevention of bedsore in bedridden patients (Evan and 
Loyal, 2007; Maki, 2009).  
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Participants: Following Institutional Review Board 
approval, seven healthy female (65.6 ± 4.1 years, 
151.2 ± 3.8cm, and 62.6 ± 5.6kg; mean±SD) were 
participated. 
Electrical Bed Selection: Two electrical bed (Type A: 
KQ-86320, Paramount Bed, Japan and Type B: PZB-
H3S, Platz Bed, Japan) were chosen by the analyses of 
market price, market share, sales volume, user 
approaching, brand awareness, test convenience, etc. 
Electrical Bed Operation: Automatic interlocking 
patterns built-in to the electrical beds were used for 
the electrical bed operations. Here, automatic 
interlocking patterns were different from each other in 
characteristics. 
Measurements and Data Acquisition: Contact area 
and pressure distribution were measured by pressure 
mapping system (Pliance FTX, Novel, Germany) to 
identify a possibility of bedsore occurrence and an 
effect of the automatic interlocking pattern change. 
They were also used in considering contact and 
boundary conditions in musculoskeletal modeling and 
to validate the musculoskeletal models described 
below. 
Three-dimensional 
(3D) 
motions 
were 
measured by 3D motion analysis system (VICON 
Motion System, VICON Ltd., England) to identify the 
characteristics of the automatic interlocking patterns 
of the electrical beds and the participant motions. Here, 
data of the 3D motions were used in musculoskeletal 
modeling described below.  
Musculoskeletal Modeling and Analysis: To identify 
alteration of normal and shear forces on the body of 
the participant as changing the automatic interlocking 
pattern of the electrical bed, musculoskeletal models 
for the electrical beds and participants were developed 
by BRG. LifeMOD (LifeModeler, Inc., USA).  
Statistical Analysis: A paired t-test and one-way 
ANOVA test with Tukey’s-b post hoc multiple 
comparisons were used to identify existence and 
nonexistence of statistically significant differences. 
Here, the significance levels for all statistical tests 
were set at 0.05. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Patterns and values of contact area and pressure 
distribution were significantly alerted as changing the 
automatic interlocking pattern of the electrical bed 
(p<0.05) (Figure. 1). Patterns and values of normal 
and shear forces were also altered by the automatic 
interlocking pattern changes (Figure 2). It was 
generally found 
that 
as 
using 
the automatic 
interlocking pattern of Type B bed, pressure values 
were repeatedly approached or exceed to the critical 
value of bedsore occurrence. Also, it was identified 
that normal and shear forces generated by using the 
automatic interlocking pattern of Type B bed were 
generally higher than those of Type A bed. These 
results indicated that using the automatic interlocking 
pattern of Type B bed could be more vulnerable to 
bedsore than using that of Type A bed. Therefore, 
from the current study, it is judged that considering an 
optimum interlocking pattern in manufacturing 
electrical bed may be one of important factors to 
prevention of bedsore.

INTRODUCTION 
 
This study was aimed at 1) identification of the 
hypothesis that musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) can 
be occurred to caregivers by repeated uses of power-
lift (Sean, 2005) and 2) suggestion of biomechanical 
factors to be considered to reduce the risk of MSDs if 
the hypothesis is true. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Participants: Following Institutional Review Board 
approval, one young healthy man (age: 26 years, 
height: 172cm, weight: 67 kg) was participated. 
Power-Lift Selection: Two power-lifts (Type A: 
Bolero, ARJO, USA and Type B: MONA, 
Horcher, USA) were chosen by the analyses of 
market price, market share, sales volume, user 
approaching, brand awareness, test convenience, etc. 
Power-Lift Operation: Operations to drive power-lift 
at strait and curve tracks were selected based on the 
analysis of power-lift workings performed frequently 
at care facilities. Then, the participant operated power-
lift during ten minutes and took a rest for forty 
minutes between operations. 
Measurements and Data Acquisition: Ten EMG 
sensors (Tringo Wireless EMG System, DELSYS, 
USA) were attached to the right muscles of the 
participant (Table 1). The EMG data were analyzed by 
using MDF (Median Frequency) technique. Contact 
area and pressure distribution were measured by 
pressure mapping system by using pedar and pliance 
system (Novel gmbh, Germany) to identify a risk of 
MSDs. They were also used in considering contact 
and boundary conditions in musculoskeletal modeling 
and to validate the musculoskeletal models described 
below. 
Three-dimensional 
(3D) 
motions 
were 
measured by VICON Motion System (VICON Ltd., 
England) to identify the characteristics of motions of 
the power-lift and the participant motions. Here, data 
of the 3D motions were used in musculoskeletal 
modeling described below.  
Musculoskeletal Modeling and Analysis: To identify 
muscle forces and joint torques required for power-lift 
operations, musculoskeletal models for the power-lift 
and the participants were developed by BRG. 
LifeMOD (LifeModeler, Inc., USA). Additionally, the 
musculoskeletal models were used to identify how 
much effective in reduction of the risk of MSDs when 
the suggested biomechanical factors were considered 
in new power-lift design.  
Statistical Analysis: A paired t-test was used to 
identify existence and nonexistence of statistically 
significant differences. Here, the significance level 
was set at 0.05. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Possibility of muscle fatigue occurrence was 
generally increased during power-lift workings 
(p<0.05) (Table 1). This result indicates that our 
hypothesis is acceptable and further more power-lift 
design should be improved with consideration of 
biomechanical and ergonomic factors. The contact 
area and pressure generated as using Type A power-
lift was generally lower and higher, respectively, than 
those as using Type B power-lift (p<0.05) (Figure 1). 
The results also showed that the contact area and 
pressure were depended on power-lift design, 
particular in handle and caster shapes (Figure 1). 
Therefore, from the results obtained the current study, 
it is supposed that improvement of power-lift design 
with consideration of biomechanical and ergonomic 
factors (here, handle and caster shapes) may be one of 
solutions for reduction of the risk of MSDs.

PURPOSE
 
Little research has been conducted to determine 
the differences in plantar loading patterns following 
surgical repair of Achilles tendon ruptures versus 
displaced calcaneal fractures (Schepers et al, 2008; 
Hastings et al, 2000).  While both types of traumatic 
injuries involve significant hindfoot structures, one 
could expect differences in plantar loading as a result 
of the characteristics of the involved tissues.  The 
intent of this preliminary study was to assess the 
variations in plantar loading patterns in individuals 
who had undergone a surgical repair of a) Achilles 
tendon following rupture or 2) intra-articular calcaneal 
or tibial plafond fracture. 
SUBJECTS 
 
Ten male subjects participated in the study; five 
had Achilles tendon repairs (ATR) and five were post-
Open Reduction Internal Fixation for hindfoot 
fractures including intra-articular calcaneal or tibial 
plafond fractures (HFFx).  The mean age of the ATR 
patients was 51.2 years and 33.0 years for the HFFX.  
At the time of testing, approximately 3 to 4 months 
post-surgery, all subjects were able to ambulate 
without using an assistive device.  All subjects had no 
history of congenital or traumatic deformity or foot 
pain on the non-involved side. 
METHODS
 
Each subject was asked to walk over a 15-meter 
walkway while in-shoe pressure data were collected 
using the PEDAR-X system.  For all in-shoe pressure 
measurements, the sensor insoles were positioned over 
a flat piece of firm insole material (durometer = 58 
Shore A) that was placed in a flat rubber-soled, non-
contoured karate shoe.  Ten consecutive steps from the 
middle 8-meters of the walkway for both the involved 
and un-involved feet were selected for analysis. Novel 
percent mask and group mask software were used to 
determine maximum mean pressure (MMP) and 
normalized Maximum Force (MaxF) for each of the 
following plantar regions: medial heel (1), lateral heel 
(2), medial midfoot (3), lateral midfoot (4), medial 
forefoot (5), and lateral forefoot (6).  A MANOVA 
was used to determine those plantar regions in which 
significant differences occurred between MMP and 
MaxF between the two groups. Based on those results, 
an ANOVA and Tukey’s pairwise comparisons were 
used to further analyze those plantar regions that were 
statistically significant.  For this abstract, only the 
plantar pressure results for the involved side will be 
presented. 
Figure 1: MANOVA results for Maximum Mean 
Pressure (MMP) (1 = HFFx; 2 = ATR). 
RESULTS
 
MaxF was not significantly different between 
ATR and HFFx for any of the six plantar regions 
analyzed.  MMP was significantly decreased (p < .05) 
in the medial midfoot and medial forefoot plantar 
regions for the HFFx group in comparison to the ATR 
group.   
 
Stance phase durations were significantly 
decreased (p < .05) between the involved and non-
involved limbs for the HFFx group but not for the 
ATR group.  The mean stance duration for the 
involved and non-involved limbs was: 1.01 sec and 
0.86 sec for HFFx and 0.78 sec and 0.77 for ATR. 
 
  
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Although a small cohort of subjects were 
evaluated in this preliminary study, it would appear 
that boney trauma of the hindfoot when compared to 
soft tissue injury, not only significantly slows walking 
speed, but also substantially reduces the amount of 
medial plantar loading of the midfoot and forefoot 
regions of the foot.  These results have important 
implications for foot orthoses design.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Functional hallux limitus (FHL) (Dananberg, 
1986) has been described as a predecessor to structural 
and debilitating deformities such as hallux rigidus and 
lesser metatarsalgia. Compensatory changes include 
increased lesser metatarsal plantar pressures and 
decreased weight bearing under the hallux. Case 
reports have shown use of a sub-hallucial wedge to 
decrease lesser metatarsal pain and increase weight 
bearing pressures under the first metatarsal phalangeal 
joint (1st MTPJ). (Clough, 2005) Other studies have 
demonstrated that control of excessive STJ pronation 
with an orthotic arch support increases 1st MTPJ 
dorsiflexion in subjects with FHL. (Munuera, 2006) 
The purpose of this pilot study was to objectively 
evaluate the biomechanical effect of a sub hallux 
wedge and arch support in subjects with FHL. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Ten asymptomatic healthy subjects with FHL 
were evaluated. All subjects had >50º of dorsiflexion 
of the 1st MTPJ in open kinetic chain and <30 º of 
dorsiflexion in weight bearing as measured with a 
goniometer. Dynamic plantar pressure was collected 
using a EMED-X (Novel LLC, St. Paul, MN) in three 
test conditions; barefoot (BF), barefoot with a sub 
hallucial wedge (CW), and barefoot with a sub 
hallucial wedge and arch support (CWA) during self-
selected comfortable paced walking. Sub-hallucial 
wedge and medial arch support were placed onto each 
foot using a custom designed brace. Peak pressure 
time integrals (PTI) were analyzed under metatarsal 
heads 1-5 and the hallux. One way Analysis of 
Variance was performed at a significance level of 
0.05.
RESULTS
 
Ten subjects (20 feet), with mean age of 26.8 
years and BMI of 27.8 kg/m2, participated in the 
study. There was no statistically significant difference 
in self-selected walking speed (mean 1.26m/s) across 
3 conditions. As expected, PTI beneath 1st MTPJ was 
significantly lower than 2nd and 3rd MTPJs in barefoot 
walking. 
When 
subjects 
walked 
with 
CWA, 
significantly reduced PTI was noted under MTPJs 2-5, 
compared to both BF and CW conditions (Figure 1).

CONCLUSION 
 
A sub-hallucial wedge (CW) by itself did not 
alter dynamic plantar pressure when compared to 
barefoot comfortable paced walking. The combination 
of the sub hallucial wedge with a medial arch support 
significantly reduced PTI under all lesser metatarsal 
heads. The hallucial wedge and medial arch support 
appear to compliment one another, suggesting the 
importance of addressing both forefoot and rearfoot 
mechanics when treating patients with a functional 
limitation of the 1st MTPJ.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Classical ballet teaching and practice are strongly 
influenced by tradition, however, biomechanical 
investigations have recently contributed to ensure a 
more secure practice and an evidence-oriented 
teaching (IMURA et al., 2008). This study aims to 
describe the effects of slippers and limb positioning on 
plantar pressure variables produced by selected 
techniques of classical ballet.  
 
METHODOLOGY 
Fourteen non-professional female dancers aged 
between 15 and 25 years old, without any 
musculoskeletal impairment, who have practiced for at 
least seven years volunteered to this study. They 
performed three valid trials of standing for four 
seconds in the following balance postures: attitude
devant, derriére and attitude a la second, with slippers 
and barefoot.  
Plantar pressure variables were quantified with an 
EMED platform (Novel, Germany) at 50 Hz sampling 
rate. Peak pressures and contact areas where compared 
between slippers vs. barefoot conditions and for the 
three different lower limb positions with a univariate 
ANOVA-test. Significant level was determined for p  
0.05.   
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Contact areas (Table 1) were statistically higher 
for the barefoot condition and no effect of the balance 
postures were found. The barefoot/slippers effect was 
not found for the contact area.

These results are in accordance with the higher 
stability reported by the dancers during the barefoot 
trials, compared to the trials performed with slippers. 
The use of slippers may have slightly limited and 
compressed dancers’ toes, a fact that may have 
reduced the contact area with the ground and affected 
the peak pressures.  
In conclusion, our findings illustrate the foot 
loading characteristics during the performance of 
balance postures. Moreover, the foot training may be 
emphasized and have beneficial effects for the 
performance of these classical ballet techniques.

INTRODUCTION 
Pressure ulcers (PU) are a significant and costly 
problem in health care area. Alternating pressure air 
mattress (APAM) is one of the popular product for 
preventing PU. Usual operating parameters of APAM 
are alternating cycle time and air cell pressure level. 
The objective of current study is to quantify a tissue 
vitality with a variation of alternating cycle time 
through tissue perfusion and interface pressure 
measurement 
to 
understand 
proper 
operating 
conditions.
METHOD
Six male(age:68.6±5.1, BMI:24.5±3.2) and six female 
subjects(age:64.1±4.2, BMI:23.3±2.5) were selected 
to test the tissue perfusion and pressure distributions at 
the air mattress(3-cell type, average air cell pressure: 
34~37mmHg, measuring time:1hour). For each 3 
alternating cycle time conditions(3,5,10min). TCM4 
Oximeters(Radiometer A/S, Denmark) were used to 
record transcutaneous partial pressures of oxygen(tcPO2)
and carbon dioxide(tcPCO2) from the tissue. Electrodes 
were calibrated using known gases and were attached 
to the skin at chest, sacrum and heel. Pliance pressure 
mapping system (Novel, Germany) which consists of a 
thin mat containing grids of miniature pressure sensors, 
was placed between the subject and the mattress, one 
at a time, to electronically record information on 
pressure distributions. Force and peak, mean pressure 
data was collected with the Pliance. 
RESULTS
The recovery & occlusion of tissue perfusion appeared 
according to the deflation & inflation of air cell. 
Perfusion recovery time(tR) and recovered pressure(PR)
were defined as dynamic parameters of tissue 
perfusion from 5% to 95% of tcPO2 values during 
tissue recovery period(Figure 1). Recovery time and 
recovered pressure for each alternating cycle time 
conditions are given at sacrum (Figure 2). From the 
figure, we can see the distinct results that shorter 
alternating cycle condition gives faster tissue recovery. 
And the recovered pressure decreased gradually with 
the increase of alternating cycle time. Thus these  
results means that shorter cycle time is more effective 
in the aspect of tissue vitality because faster and 
stronger recovery characteristics can be acquired. 
However peak pressure and force from interface 
pressure measurement was irregularly changed with 
alternating cycle time(Figure 3). This might be

INTRODUCTION 
 
Most FE models in the literatur 1, 2, 3   are based 
on boundary conditions without concerning muscular 
forces of the lower leg. The aim of our study was to 
get boundary conditions using data of a gait analysis 
in combination with ANYBODY muscle modelling. 
METHODS
 
We examined 10 healthy subjects with a Vicon 
MX System (6 Cameras). Additionally we performed 
an AMTI force platform, a Novel SF pressure 
measurement System and a MegaWin EMG system, 
synchronized with the Vicon system. The muscle 
forces were determined using a slightly modified 
model 
from 
the 
repository 
AMMRV1.1 
of 
ANYBODY 
TECHNOLOGY 
(Vaughan). 
Postprocessing with the EMG data was done. A 
modified finite element model from the Website 
ww.ulb.ac.be/project/vakhum/ which is based on CT 
Scan was used. Contacts between bones were 
considered with 3 different methods. 1. as bonded, 2. 
as joints with less friction and 3. as frictional contact 
with 
additional 
ligaments 
because 
of 
a 
underconstrained model. We were firstly interested in 
reaction forces/moments and not in stress and strain. 
Therefore we did a quasi static analysis computing the 
reaction forces/moments in every 10% of stance phase 
in each joint. The foot was fixed at the end of the tibia 
and the fibula. The position of the foot segments in the 
FE model were adapted  due to the kinematic 
measurements. The reaction forces we measured with 
a force plate and an EMED SF as well as a PEDAR 
System. As a novel method to get additional boundary 
condition we used the model of Vaughan from the 
ANYBODY muscle modelling Repository. 
RESULTS
 
Reaction forces and moments were with all 3 
methods comparable, opposite to stress and strain 
which showed huge differences, especially in contact 
regions. Reaction forces and moments in the ankle 
joint computed with our FE model fit very well with 
results we get from the ANYBODY model. In other 
joints such as TMT and MTP joints we get similar 
results as for example Jacob4 described. 
DISCUSSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
 
The above shown method to get the boundary 
conditions for an FE Model from gait analysis and 
ANYBODY modelling is probably a valuable method 
for clinicians in the future. The method seems to be 
satisfactory to get reaction forces and moments.  
 
There are further investigations necessary, to 
simulate stress and strain. The main problem here 
seems to be an underconstrained model using 
frictionless contacts. Main reason for that are the 
unbalanced muscle forces from the ANYBODY 
modelling system in combination with the applicated 
geometry of the foot. Other possibilities to avoid a 
underconstrained model such as the introduction of 
ligaments or weak springs even though frictional 
contact is in our understanding not a satisfactory 
solution.

RELIABILITY OF IN-SOLE PLANTAR PRESSURE USING SIMPLE AND DETAILED 
MASKS OF THE FOREFOOT, MIDFOOT, AND HINDFOOT 
Jonathan S. Akins, Karen A. Keenan, Brian P. Dugan, Melanie Francis. Francis, John P. 
Abt, Timothy C. Sell, Scott M. Lephart 
Neuromuscular Research Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh, PA 
BACKGROUND 
 
Plantar pressure measurements obtained with in-
shoe pressure sensor insoles can be analyzed by 
dividing the foot into anatomical regions using masks. 
A simple mask could divide the foot into four regions: 
toes, forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot. A detailed mask 
could further divide these regions to capture data from 
specific anatomical regions/structures. For example, 
dividing the forefoot into individual metatarsals may 
help clinicians and researchers indentify individuals 
who are at increased risk of stress-related injuries to 
these structures (e.g. stress fracture). Regardless of 
which mask is applied, these measures must be 
reliable. The purpose of this study was to obtain the 
reliability of in-sole plantar pressure measurements 
using simple and detailed masks and to determine 
which is more reliable. 
  
METHODS
 
Ten healthy males (n=8) and females (n=2) 
participated in this study (age: 27.7 ± 4.1 years, mass: 
77.6 ± 10.7 kg, height: 174.3 ± 7.0 cm). Subjects 
performed a gait task on two different days using the 
PEDAR-X  
system 
(Novel 
GmbH, 
Munich, 
Germany) to measure in-sole plantar pressures 
(100Hz) using their own athletic footwear (without 
socks). After familiarization of the task, subjects 
performed three trials of 20 consecutive straight-line 
walking steps using usual gait across a level, 
laboratory floor. 
®
 
Maximum force (MF), force-time integral (FTI), 
peak pressure (PP), pressure-time integral (PTI), and 
maximum mean pressure (MMP) were calculated for 
simple and detailed masks. Both masks divided the 
foot into three primary regions: the forefoot, midfoot, 
and hindfoot. The simple mask divided the forefoot 
into metatarsal 1, 2, and 3-5; and did not divide the 
midfoot and hindfoot. The detailed mask divided the 
forefoot into individual metatarsals and the midfoot 
and hindfoot into medial/lateral regions. Intraclass 
correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated using a 
two-way random effects model (ICC [2,k]). ICCs were 
averaged for each variable to obtain a single ICC 
value for the simple and detailed masks. Left and right 
foot measurements were combined for the analyses. A 
t-test was used to identify significant differences 
between the simple and detailed masks (Į=0.05). 
RESULTS
 
No significant differences were found between 
the simple and detailed masks. Maximum force and 
force-time-integral resulted in excellent reliability 
(ICC>0.90) for all masks and regions. Peak pressure, 
pressure-time-integral, and maximum mean pressure 
resulted in good reliability (ICC>0.70) for all masks 
and regions.

DISCUSSION 
 
In-sole plantar pressure measurements obtained 
demonstrated good reliability for all masks and 
regions indicating that the PEDAR-X® system is 
capable of collecting reliable data, regardless of which 
mask is utilized. These findings are similar those of 
previous studies (Boyd et al, 1997; Putti el al, 2007). 
The lowest ICC was for MMP using the detailed mask 
for the midfoot, which may be a function of the small 
contact area of the medial midfoot. Since the contact 
area is relatively small, it is possible that even small 
variation in the rollover pattern during gait may 
significantly affect measurements in this region. It is 
therefore recommended to not subdivide this region in 
order to maximize the reliability of the measurements 
obtained, both in the clinical and research settings.

THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE, LIGAMENT LAXITY AND HORMONAL 
FLUCTUATION ON PLANTAR PRESSURE IN FEMALE ATHLETES

INTRODUCTION
 
Overuse injuries of the lower extremity compose 
over 20% of injuries in collegiate athletes, up to 50% 
of injuries in pediatric athletics (Arendt, 2003, 
Bennell, et al., 1996, Dalton, 1992) and a considerable 
portion of injuries in military recruits (Milgrom, et al.,
1985, Rauh, et al., 2006).  Like some traumatic 
injuries 
(acl 
tears) 
overuse/stress 
injuries 
are 
significantly more frequently observed in women 
(Taunton, et al., 2002).  The etiology of sex 
differences in overuse injuries has been associated 
with various factors including training, anatomical 
differences, hormonal differences, and joint laxity.  
Joint laxity has also been associated with fluctuating 
hormone levels.  Specifically, estrogen has been 
associated with suppression of collagen synthesis and 
decreased ligament cross-sectional area (Abubaker, et 
al., 1996, Booth, et al., 1970, Liu, et al., 1997, 
Samuel, et al., 1996). As collagen serves to provide 
stiffness to biological tissues such as ligaments and 
tendons, its breakdown can play a key role in 
enhanced joint laxity.  In this study we quantify 
hormone levels, ligament laxity, and plantar pressure 
distribution to investigate the extent to which hormone 
fluctuation and fatigue interact to influence plantar 
pressure distribution and lower limb load. 
METHODS
 
Twenty-four female collegiate athletes were 
tested, 8 for a four-week protocol and 16 for a twelve-
week protocol.  Blood was drawn each visit and 
subsequently assayed for estradiol content using an 
ELISA kit.  Ankle ligament laxity was measured using 
an ankle arthrometer, and subjects walked, ran and cut 
barefoot over an EMED-SF plantar pressure platform.  
Following a fatigue test (stair running followed by a 
modified hurdle beep test), lactate levels, ankle laxity 
and plantar pressure were re-measured. Repeated 
measures ANOVA was used to compare ligament 
laxity and plantar pressure in 7 foot regions across 
menstrual weeks and fatigue states.   
RESULTS
 
Ankle ligament laxity increased following 
fatigue (p<0.05). There was also significant variation 
across subjects (p<0.01). Females had more ligament 
laxity than males (p<0.01), and there was an 
interaction between gender and fatigue such that 
females experienced a greater increase in ligament 
laxity post-fatigue than males. There was a significant 
interaction between menstrual week and fatigue such 
that the effect of fatigue was significantly greater in 
week 4 and lower in week 2 than any other menstrual 
week.  While hormone levels may not themselves 
affect ligament laxity, the interaction of hormone level 
and fatigue may influence ligament laxity. 
Peak plantar pressures exhibit variation across 
foot region, menstrual week and fatigue condition.  
Peak pressures in metatarsals 2-5 are significantly 
(p<0.01) lower post-fatigue than pre-fatigue.  Peak 
pressures in the medial and lateral midfoot, however, 
vary based on menstrual week and fatigue condition.  
In weeks 1 and 2 post-fatigue midfoot peak pressure 
are higher post-fatigue than pre-fatigue (p<0.05), 
while post-fatigue pressures are slightly lower than 
pre-fatigue pressures in weeks 3 and 4. Week 2 is also 
the week of greatest ligament laxity, suggesting foot 
ligament laxity is allowing some midfoot collapse, 
especially post-fatigue when the plantarflexors are 
fatigued and providing less load resistance (Sharkey,
et al., 1999, Weist, et al., 2004). This laxity may also 
reduce load transmission to the metatarsal heads.

metatarsal 2 across weeks and fatigue state.

COMPARISON OF PLANTAR PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED DURING 
BAREFOOT AND SHOD CONDITIONS 
Jonathan S. Akins, Karen A. Keenan, Brian P. Dugan, Melanie Francis, John P. Abt, 
Timothy C. Sell, Scott M. Lephart 
Neuromuscular Research Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh, PA 
BACKGROUND 
 
Pedobarographic platforms allow for assessment 
of plantar pressures at the foot-ground interface 
whereas pedobaragraphic insoles allow for assessment 
at the foot-shoe interface. It has been suggested that 
barefoot assessments may be more sensitive in 
detecting risk factors for the development of exercise 
related lower leg pain than shod assessments 
(Willems, 2007). Plantar pressures may be altered or 
attenuated by footwear, thereby making detection of 
small but significant variations in plantar pressure 
measurements more difficult in shod conditions. In 
addition, barefoot assessments require less subject 
preparation, may allow for data to be collected on 
more subjects in a shorter period of time, and require a 
smaller 
laboratory 
space, 
thereby 
potentially 
simplifying the data collection process. The purpose of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
compare 
plantar 
pressure 
measurements obtained while barefoot to those 
obtained while shod.  
METHODS
 
Ten healthy males (n=8) and females (n=2) 
participated in this study (age: 27.7 ± 4.1 years, mass: 
77.6 ± 10.7 kg, height: 174.3 ± 7.0 cm). Data were 
collected on two different days in both barefoot and 
shod 
conditions. 
Barefoot 
measurements 
were 
obtained with the EMED-X  (Novel GmbH, Munich, 
Germany), sampling at 100Hz. A two-step approach at 
a self-selected speed was utilized for all trials. After 
familiarization of the task, subjects performed 10 
right-foot trials. 
®
 
Shod measurements were obtained with the 
PEDAR-X  
system 
(Novel 
GmbH, 
Munich, 
Germany), sampling at 100Hz. Subjects used their 
own athletic footwear, without socks, and were asked 
to practice straight-line walking at their “usual” 
walking speed. After familiarization, three trials of 20 
consecutive straight-line steps across a level tiled floor 
were recorded. 
®
 
For the barefoot trials, average maximum force 
(MF) and peak pressure (PP) were calculated for all 
trials. For the shod trials, the first and last two right 
steps were removed and MF and PP were calculated 
for the remaining right-foot steps. A similar mask was 
applied to both barefoot and shod trials with the 
following regions: medial heel, lateral heel, midfoot, 
each metatarsal (1-5), great toe, toe 2, and toes345. A 
t-test compared MF and PP obtained in the barefoot 
(EMED) and shod (PEDAR) conditions (Į=0.05). 
 
RESULTS
 
PEDAR and EMED measurements differed 
significantly in several regions (Table 1).

DISCUSSION 
 
 Statistically 
different 
plantar 
pressure 
measurements were obtained in barefoot and shod 
conditions. Peak pressure appears to be significantly 
attenuated in the hindfoot, MT2 through MT4, and the 
great toe in the shod condition. Maximum force was 
significantly attenuated in MT2 through MT4, T2 and 
T345. If the variable of interest is peak pressure, then 
barefoot assessments may be preferred. However, 
since most athletic activities are performed while shod 
and the results were inconsistent, it may be more 
appropriate to assess plantar pressure in the shod 
condition.
