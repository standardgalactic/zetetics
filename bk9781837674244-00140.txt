Hamiltonian Operator
The Hamiltonian operator, bH, (and commonly just ‘the Hamiltonian’)
of a system is the operator for its total energy, the sum of the oper-
ators for its kinetic and potential energies. In the position represen-
tation of quantum mechanics, the form in which elementary
applications are usually expressed, the Hamiltonian operator for a
particle of mass m in a one-dimensional system is

Harpoon Mechanism
In the harpoon mechanism of the collision between an alkali metal ion
M and a dihalogen molecule X2, an electron jumps from M to X2 when
that results in a lower energy, and then M1 and X2
 are drawn to-
gether by their mutual Coulombic attraction. As a result, the reaction
collision cross-section is much larger than their physical cross-
section. The distance at which the electron transfers, R, is predicted by
equating the diﬀerence in the ionization energy of M and the electron
aﬃnity of X2 to the Coulombic potential energy of the resulting ions:
R ¼
e2
4pe0{I(M)  Eea(X2)}
Heat
Heat is the mode of transfer of energy that is due to a temperature
diﬀerence between a system and its surroundings. The quantity of
energy transferred to the system in this way is denoted q, or dq of the
quantity is infinitesimal. The resulting change in internal energy, pro-
vided no other types of transfer take place, is dU ¼ dq. Specifically, if the
volume of a closed (constant composition) system is constant during
the transfer, and no other processes are taking place, then DU¼ qV, the
subscript denoting constant volume. If the pressure on a closed system
is constant, and no other processes are taking place, then DH¼ qp.
At a molecular level, heat corresponds to the transfer of energy that
makes use of or generates disorderly motion in the surroundings
(Figure H.9). As such, it is distinguished from work, the transfer of

energy that makes use of orderly motion in the surroundings. The term
‘heat’ should be distinguished from thermal motion, the disorderly
motion of molecules, which is commonly used as a synonym.
Heat Capacity
The heat capacity, C, of a system is a measure of the energy, q, that
must be transferred to a system as heat in order to bring about a
specified rise in temperature, DT: q ¼ CDT. If the heat capacity is
large, then a large quantity of energy as heat is needed to bring about
a given rise in temperature. This general concept of heat capacity is
refined in thermodynamics by noting that the energy transferred as
heat to a system of constant volume can be identified with the change
in its internal energy, and if the pressure is constant, then with the
change in its enthalpy. Then the isochoric heat capacity (more com-
monly, the constant-volume heat capacity), CV, and the isobaric heat
capacity (the constant-pressure heat capacity), Cp, are defined for a
system of constant composition as
CV ¼

See Figure H.10. They are both extensive properties; the correspond-
ing molar quantities, CV,m ¼ CV/n and Cp,m ¼ Cp/n are intensive. The
specific heat capacity in each case is CX,s ¼ CX/m, where m is the mass
of the sample.
The two heat capacities diﬀer on account of the energy that must be
used to expand the system (against the external atmosphere and to
overcome internal cohesive forces) when it is not constrained to be at
constant volume. As that energy is transferred to the surroundings or

where a is the (isobaric) expansion coeﬃcient and kT is the isothermal
compressibility of the system. For a perfect gas, where the only con-
tribution to the work of expansion is that arising from driving back
the atmosphere, this expression simplifies to
Cp;m  CV;m ¼ R
At a molecular level, the heat capacity is large if there are many
energy levels thermally accessible to the system, in which case
populations can be transferred readily between them. At room tem-
perature, many monatomic nonmetallic solids follow, approximately
at least, Dulong and Petit’s law, that CV,mE3R. This law can be justified
on the basis of the equipartition theorem and the oscillation of atoms
in three dimensions. The heat capacities of all substance tend to zero
as T - 0 because fewer energy levels become accessible. At low tem-
peratures, nonmetallic solids obey the Debye-T 3 law, that CV,mEaT 3,
where a is a constant characteristic of the solid. Metallic solids show
an additional contribution stemming from the possibility of exciting
electrons near the top of the conduction band. For them, CV,mE

Quantum mechanical theories of heat capacities take into account

Heat Engine
A heat engine is a cyclic device for the conversion of heat into work
(Figure H.12). That is, it continuously draws energy as heat from a hot
source, transfers some of that energy to the surroundings as work,
and deposits the rest of the energy as heat into a cold sink. See Carnot
cycle and eﬃciency. A heat engine in reverse is a refrigerator.

The Helmholtz energy, A, is defined as
A ¼ U  TS

where U is the internal energy of the system, T is its temperature, and
S is its entropy. It is a state function. A change in its value at constant
temperature is equal to the maximum work that the system can
achieve:
At constant temperature: DA ¼ wmax
The Helmholtz energy can be pictured as the energy of the system
that is stored in an orderly way and hence is available for causing
orderly motion in the surroundings. The change in Helmholtz
energy is proportional to the change in total entropy of the system
and its surroundings when the system is maintained at constant
volume:
At constant volume: DA ¼  TDStotal
It follows that a spontaneous change in a system at constant volume is
accompanied by a decrease in Helmholtz energy.
Hermann–Mauguin System
The Hermann–Mauguin system (or International system) is used to label
symmetry groups, more commonly for crystals than for individual
molecules. In the system, which is set out in Table H.1,
n denotes the presence of an n-fold axis
m denotes a mirror plane
/ indicates that the mirror plane is perpendicular to the symmetry

Hückel Approximation
The Hückel approximation is a primitive scheme for calculating the p
orbitals and energies of conjugated polyenes. The Hamiltonian matrix
is constructed by setting all diagonal elements equal to a – E, all oﬀ-
diagonal elements between neighbours equal to b, all other elements
to zero; overlap is ignored. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
the matrix are the energy levels and linear combination coeﬃcients
(of the carbon atom p orbitals), respectively, and are best found by using
mathematical software. Figure H.13 shows two typical outcomes.
Hund’s Rules
Hund’s rules are a guide to the lowest energy term of an atom and can
be extended to molecules.
1. Electrons occupy orbitals singly before occupying them doubly.
2. Electrons occupy orbitals that result in the maximum value of
the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, L.
3. Electrons adopt the maximum number of parallel spins com-
patible with their orbital occupation. This is the maximum
multiplicity rule, with atoms achieving the maximum value of the
total spin angular momentum, S.
4. If the shell is less than half full, minimum J lies lowest; if it is
more than half full, maximum J lies lowest.
The maximum multiplicity rule stems from the quantum mech-
anical property of spin correlation in which electrons with the same

spin tend to stay apart from one another. This mutual avoidance
permits the atom to shrink slightly with the result that electrons
experience a more favourable nuclear attraction.
Hybridization
Hybridization is the mixing of two or more atomic orbitals on the
same atom. It is a feature of valence bond theory aimed at providing
equivalent, local bonds that conform to the shape of the molecule.
Three characteristic hybridization schemes and their mutually ortho-
gonal orbital compositions are:

Tetrahedral and trigonal hybrids are shown in Figure H.14. Note that
N atomic orbitals give rise to N mutually orthogonal hybrid orbitals.
Other symmetrical schemes are listed in Table H.2. Hybrid orbitals
can be constructed for a variety of geometries by selecting combi-
nations that give rise to hybrids that match the geometry and are
mutually orthogonal.

Hydrogen Bond
A hydrogen bond is a link between atoms of two electronegative elem-
ents, A and B, one of which (B) has a lone pair of electrons, bridged by a
hydrogen atom and denoted A–H  B. Typically, A and B are any of N, O,
and F, but anions may also participate. A variety of theories have been
given for its formation; all depend on the small size of the proton and
its ability to lie between two nearby atoms. In the molecular orbital
explanation (Figure H.15), the atoms A, H, and B each supply one
atomic orbital and form a bonding, an almost nonbonding, and an
antibonding molecular orbital. The first two are occupied by the four

electrons provided by the A–H bond and the B lone pair. As the anti-
bonding orbital remains unoccupied, this arrangement has a lower
energy than the separate AH and B components.
The strength of a hydrogen bond is approximately 20 kJ mol1. Its
formation accounts for many of the anomalous properties of water
(including its low vapour pressure and the relative mass densities of
the liquid and solid phases). It is of major importance in determining
the secondary structure of biological macromolecules.
Hydrogen Molecule and Molecule-ion
The description of the bond in the hydrogen molecule, H2, can be re-
garded as the starting point of the valence bond description of the
chemical bond, and that of the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2
1, the starting
point of the molecular orbital theory of bonding. Valence bond theory
ascribes the bond to spin pairing of the electrons supplied by the two
atoms, which enables (via the Pauli principle) the two electrons to be
described by the spatial wavefunction cA(1)cB(2)þ cA(2)cB(1). In that
combination there is constructive interference in the internuclear region
and a consequent lowering of energy of the two paired electrons. More
complex molecules are described by localized bonds formed similarly. In
molecular orbital theory, bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals,
cA  cB are constructed from the H1s atomic orbitals. The occupation of
the bonding combination by even a single electron lowers the energy,
once again largely due to constructive interference in the internuclear
region. A second electron can join the first to strengthen the bond
provided its spin is opposite to that of the first electron. The theory is
extended to more complex molecules by including more atomic orbitals
in the linear combinations. The Schrödinger equation for the electron in
H2
1 can be solved analytically, but the resulting wavefunctions (in
spheroidal coordinates) are of too great a complexity to be useful.
The energies of the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals of
H2
1 are obtained by inserting them into the Schrödinger equation

All orbitals of the same principal quantum number, n, have the
same energy and belong to the same shell of the atom. A shell is
sometimes designated by the letters K, L, M,. . . for n ¼ 1, 2, 3,. . .. The
members of a shell with the same value of the orbital angular
momentum quantum number l form a subshell of the atom. There are
n subshells in a shell with quantum number n. They are commonly
designated by the letters s, p, d, f,. . . for l ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3,. . .. A subshell
with quantum number l consists of 2l þ 1 orbitals that are dis-
tinguished by the magnetic quantum number, ml. It follows that there
are n2 degenerate orbitals in a shell with quantum number n. See
quantum number for a further description of their significance and
the entries for each type of orbital.
The ground state of a hydrogenic atom has the configuration 1s1
and term symbol 2S1/2. Its ionization energy is hc~RNZ2E13.59Z2 eV.
Hyperfine Structure
The hyperfine structure of a spectrum is the splitting of absorption
lines that arises from the interaction of an electron with a nucleus
other than by the Coulombic interaction. Two common sources are
magnetic interaction of electrons and nuclei and the interaction of
the nuclear quadrupole moment with the electric field gradient at the
nucleus.
