Preface
As an essential element of a radio system, the antenna has always been an interesting but
difﬁcult subject for radio frequency (RF) engineering students and engineers. Many good
books on antennas have been published over the years and some of them were used as our
major references.
This book is different from other antenna books. It is especially designed for people who
know little about antennas but would like to learn this subject from the very basics to practical
antenna analysis, design and measurement within a relatively short period of time. In order
to gain a comprehensive understanding of antennas, one must know about transmission lines
and radio propagation. At the moment, people often have to read a number of different books,
which may not be well correlated. Thus, it is not the most efﬁcient way to study the subject.
In this book we put all the necessary information about antennas into a single volume and
try to examine antennas from both the circuit point of view and the ﬁeld point of view. The
book covers the basic transmission line and radio propagation theories, which are then used
to gain a good understanding of antenna basics and theory. Various antennas are examined
and design examples are presented. Particular attention is given to modern computer-aided
antenna design. Both basic and advanced computer software packages are used in examples to
illustrate how they can be used for antenna analysis and design. Antenna measurement theory
and techniques are also addressed. Some special topics on the latest antenna development are
covered in the ﬁnal chapter.
The material covered in the book is mainly based on a successful short course on antennas
for practising professionals at the University of Oxford and the Antennas module for students
at the University of Liverpool. The book covers important and timely issues involving modern
practical antenna design and theory. Many examples and questions are given in each chapter. It
is an ideal textbook for university antenna courses, professional training courses and self-study.
It is also a valuable reference for engineers and designers who work with RF engineering, radar
and radio communications.
The book is organized as follows:
Chapter 1: Introduction. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the concept of antennas
and review essential mathematics and electromagnetics, especially Maxwell’s equations. Ma-
terial properties (permittivity, permeability and conductivity) are discussed and some common
ones are tabulated.
Chapter 2: Circuit Concepts and Transmission Lines. The concepts of lumped and dis-
tributed systems are established. The focus is placed on the fundamentals and characteristics
of transmission lines. A comparison of various transmission lines and connectors is presented.
The Smith Chart, impedance matching and bandwidth are also addressed in this chapter.

Preface
Chapter 3: Field Concepts and Radio Waves. Field concepts, including the plane wave,
intrinsic impedance and polarization, are introduced and followed by a discussion on radio
propagation mechanisms and radio wave propagation characteristics in various media. Some
basic radio propagation models are introduced, and circuit concepts and ﬁeld concepts are
compared at the end of this chapter.
Chapter 4: Antenna Basics. The essential and important parameters of an antenna (such
as the radiation pattern, gain and input impedance) are addressed from both the circuit point
of view and ﬁeld point of view. Through this chapter, you will become familiar with antenna
language, understand how antennas work and know what design considerations are.
Chapter 5: Popular Antennas. In this long chapter, some of the most popular antennas (wire-
type, aperture-type and array antennas) are examined and analyzed using relevant antenna
theories. The aim is to see why they have become popular, what their major features and
properties are (including advantages and disadvantages) and how they should be designed.
Chapter6:Computer-AidedAntennaDesignandAnalysis.Theaimofthisspecialandunique
chapter is to give a brief review of antenna-modeling methods and software development,
introduce the basic theory behind computer simulation tools and demonstrate how to use
industry standard software to analyze and design antennas. Two software packages (one is
simple and free) are presented with step-by-step illustrations.
Chapter 7: Antenna Manufacturing and Measurements. This is another practical chapter to
address two important issues: how to make an antenna and how to conduct antenna measure-
ment, with a focus placed on the measurement. It introduces S-parameters and equipment. A
good overview of the possible measurement systems is provided with an in-depth example.
Some measurement techniques and problems are also presented.
Chapter 8: Special Topics. This ﬁnal chapter presents some of the latest important develop-
ments in antennas. It covers mobile antennas and antenna diversity, RFID antennas, multiband
and broadband antennas, reconﬁgurable antennas and electrically small antennas. Both the
theory and practical examples are given.

Introduction
1.1 A Short History of Antennas
Workonantennasstartedmanyyearsago.Theﬁrstwell-knownsatisfactoryantennaexperiment
was conducted by the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (1857–1894), pictured in
Figure 1.1. The SI (International Standard) frequency unit, the Hertz, is named after him. In
1887 he built a system, as shown in Figure 1.2, to produce and detect radio waves. The original
intention of his experiment was to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic radiation.
In the transmitter, a variable voltage source was connected to a dipole (a pair of one-meter
wires) with two conducting balls (capacity spheres) at the ends. The gap between the balls
could be adjusted for circuit resonance as well as for the generation of sparks. When the voltage
was increased to a certain value, a spark or break-down discharge was produced. The receiver
was a simple loop with two identical conducting balls. The gap between the balls was carefully
tuned to receive the spark effectively. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box in order to
see the spark clearly. In his experiment, when a spark was generated at the transmitter, he also
observed a spark at the receiver gap at almost the same time. This proved that the information
from location A (the transmitter) was transmitted to location B (the receiver) in a wireless
manner – by electromagnetic waves.
The information in Hertz’s experiment was actually in binary digital form, by tuning the
spark on and off. This could be considered the very ﬁrst digital wireless system, which consisted
of two of the best-known antennas: the dipole and the loop. For this reason, the dipole antenna
is also called the Hertz (dipole) antenna.
Whilst Heinrich Hertz conducted his experiments in a laboratory and did not quite know
what radio waves might be used for in practice, Guglielmo Marconi (1874–1937, pictured
in Figure 1.3), an Italian inventor, developed and commercialized wireless technology by
introducing a radiotelegraph system, which served as the foundation for the establishment of
numerous afﬁliated companies worldwide. His most famous experiment was the transatlantic
transmission from Poldhu, UK to St Johns, Newfoundland in Canada in 1901, employing
untuned systems. He shared the 1909 Nobel Prize for Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun
‘in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy’. Monopole
antennas (near quarter-wavelength) were widely used in Marconi’s experiments; thus vertical
monopole antennas are also called Marconi antennas.

During World War II, battles were won by the side that was ﬁrst to spot enemy aeroplanes,
ships or submarines. To give the Allies an edge, British and American scientists developed
radar technology to ‘see’ targets from hundreds of miles away, even at night. The research
resulted in the rapid development of high-frequency radar antennas, which were no longer just
wire-type antennas. Some aperture-type antennas, such as reﬂector and horn antennas, were
developed, an example is shown in Figure 1.4.

Broadband, circularly polarized antennas, as well as many other types, were subsequently
developed for various applications. Since an antenna is an essential device for any radio
broadcasting, communication or radar system, there has always been a requirement for new
and better antennas to suit existing and emerging applications.
More recently, one of the main challenges for antennas has been how to make them broad-
band and small enough in size for wireless mobile communications systems. For example,
WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) is one of the latest systems aimed
at providing high-speed wireless data communications (>10 Mb/s) over long distances from
point-to-point links to full mobile cellular-type access over a wide frequency band. The original
WiMAX standard in IEEE 802.16 speciﬁed 10 to 66 GHz as the WiMAX band; IEEE 802.16a

Facility)

was updated in 2004 to 802.16-2004 and added 2 to 11 GHz as an additional frequency range.
The frequency bandwidth is extremely wide although the most likely frequency bands to be
used initially will be around 3.5 GHz, 2.3/2.5 GHz and 5 GHz.
The UWB (ultra-wide band) wireless system is another example of recent broadband radio
communication systems. The allocated frequency band is from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz. The beauty of
the UWB system is that the spectrum, which is normally very expensive, can be used free of
charge but the power spectrum density is limited to −41.3 dBm/MHz. Thus, it is only suitable
for short-distance applications. The antenna design for these systems faces many challenging
issues.
The role of antennas is becoming increasingly important. In some systems, the antenna is
now no longer just a simple transmitting/receiving device, but a device which is integrated with
other parts of the system to achieve better performance. For example, the MIMO (multiple-in,
multiple-out) antenna system has recently been introduced as an effective means to combat
multipath effects in the radio propagation channel and increase the channel capacity, where
several coordinated antennas are required.
Things have been changing quickly in the wireless world. But one thing has never changed
since the very ﬁrst antenna was made: the antenna is a practical engineering subject. It will
remain an engineering subject. Once an antenna is designed and made, it must be tested. How
well it works is not just determined by the antenna itself, it also depends on the other parts of
the system and the environment. The standalone antenna performance can be very different
from that of an installed antenna. For example, when a mobile phone antenna is designed, we
must take the case, other parts of the phone and even our hands into account to ensure that it
will work well in the real world. The antenna is an essential device of a radio system, but not
an isolated device! This makes it an interesting and challenging subject.
1.2 Radio Systems and Antennas
A radio system is generally considered to be an electronic system which employs radio waves,
a type of electromagnetic wave up to GHz frequencies. An antenna, as an essential part of a
radio system, is deﬁned as a device which can radiate and receive electromagnetic energy in
an efﬁcient and desired manner. It is normally made of metal, but other materials may also be
used.Forexample,ceramicmaterialshavebeenemployedtomakedielectricresonatorantennas
(DRAs). There are many things in our lives, such as power leads, that can radiate and receive
electromagnetic energy but they cannot be viewed as antennas because the electromagnetic
energy is not transmitted or received in an efﬁcient and desired manner, and because they are
not a part of a radio system.
Since radio systems possess some unique and attractive advantages over wired systems,
numerous radio systems have been developed. TV, radar and mobile radio communication
systems are just some examples. The advantages include:
r mobility: this is essential for mobile communications;
r good coverage: the radiation from an antenna can cover a very large area, which is good for
TV and radio broadcasting and mobile communications;
r low pathloss: this is frequency dependent. Since the loss of a transmission line is an expo-
nential function of the distance (the loss in dB = distance × per unit loss in dB) and the loss

Introduction
5
of a radio wave is proportional to the distance squared (the loss in dB = 20 log10 (distance)),
the pathloss of radio waves can be much smaller than that of a cable link. For example,
assume that the loss is 10 dB for both a transmission line and a radio wave over 100 m; if the
distance is now increased to 1000 m, the loss for the transmission line becomes 10 × 10 =
100 dB but the loss for the radio link is just 10 + 20 = 30 dB! This makes the radio link
extremely attractive for long-distance communication. It should be pointed out that optical
ﬁbers are also employed for long-distance communications since they are of very low loss
and ultra-wide bandwidth.
Figure 1.5 illustrates a typical radio communication system. The source information is
normally modulated and ampliﬁed in the transmitter and then passed on to the transmit antenna
via a transmission line, which has a typical characteristic impedance (explained in the next
chapter) of 50 ohms. The antenna radiates the information in the form of an electromagnetic
wave in an efﬁcient and desired manner to the destination, where the information is picked up
by the receive antenna and passed on to the receiver via another transmission line. The signal
is demodulated and the original message is then recovered at the receiver.
Thus, the antenna is actually a transformer that transforms electrical signals (voltages and
currents from a transmission line) into electromagnetic waves (electric and magnetic ﬁelds),
or vice versa. For example, a satellite dish antenna receives the radio wave from a satellite and
transforms it into electrical signals which are output to a cable to be further processed. Our eyes
may be viewed as another example of antennas. In this case, the wave is not a radio wave but
an optical wave, another form of electromagnetic wave which has much higher frequencies.
Now it is clear that the antenna is actually a transformer of voltage/current to electric/
magnetic ﬁelds, it can also be considered a bridge to link the radio wave and transmission line.
An antenna system is deﬁned as the combination of the antenna and its feed line. As an antenna
is usually connected to a transmission line, how to best make this connection is a subject of
interest, since the signal from the feed line should be radiated into the space in an efﬁcient
and desired way. Transmission lines and radio waves are, in fact, two different subjects in
engineering. To understand antenna theory, one has to understand transmission lines and radio
waves, which will be discussed in detail in Chapters 2 and 3 respectively.
In some applications where space is very limited (such as hand-portables and aircraft), it is
desirable to integrate the antenna and its feed line. In other applications (such as the reception
of TV broadcasting), the antenna is far away from the receiver and a long transmission line
has to be used.
Unlike other devices in a radio system (such as ﬁlters and ampliﬁers), the antenna is a very
special device; it deals with electrical signals (voltages and currents) as well as electromagnetic
waves (electric ﬁelds and magnetic ﬁelds), making antenna design an interesting and difﬁcult

subject. For different applications, the requirements on the antenna may be very different, even
for the same frequency band.
In conclusion, the subject of antennas is about how to design a suitable device which will be
well matched with its feed line and radiate/receive the radio waves in an efﬁcient and desired
manner.
1.3 Necessary Mathematics
To understand antenna theory thoroughly requires a considerable amount of mathematics.
However, the intention of this book is to provide the reader with a solid foundation in antenna
theory and apply the theory to practical antenna design. Here we are just going to introduce and
review the essential and important mathematics required for this book. More in-depth study
materials can be obtained from other references [1, 2].
1.3.1 Complex Numbers
In mathematics, a complex number, Z, consists of real and imaginary parts, that is
Z = R + j X
(1.1)
where R is called the real part of the complex number Z, i.e. Re(Z), and X is deﬁned as the
imaginary part of Z, i.e. Im(Z). Both R and X are real numbers and j (not the traditional
notation i in mathematics to avoid confusion with a changing current in electrical engineering)
is the imaginary unit and is deﬁned by
j =
√
−1
(1.2)
Thus
j2 = −1
(1.3)
Geometrically, a complex number can be presented in a two-dimensional plane where the
imaginary part is found on the vertical axis whilst the real part is presented by the horizontal
axis, as shown in Figure 1.6.
In this model, multiplication by −1 corresponds to a rotation of 180 degrees about the
origin. Multiplication by j corresponds to a 90-degree rotation anti-clockwise, and the equation
j2 = −1 is interpreted as saying that if we apply two 90-degree rotations about the origin, the
net result is a single 180-degree rotation. Note that a 90-degree rotation clockwise also satisﬁes
this interpretation.
Another representation of a complex number Z uses the amplitude and phase form:
Z = Ae jϕ

where A is the amplitude and ϕ is the phase of the complex number Z; these are also shown
in Figure 1.6. The two different representations are linked by the following equations:
Z = R + j X = Ae jϕ;
A =
√
R2 + X2,
ϕ = tan−1(X/R)
R = A cos ϕ,
X = A sin ϕ
(1.5)
1.3.2 Vectors and Vector Operation
A scalar is a one-dimensional quantity which has magnitude only, whereas a complex number
is a two-dimensional quantity. A vector can be viewed as a three-dimensional (3D) quantity,
and a special one – it has both a magnitude and a direction. For example, force and velocity
are vectors (whereas speed is a scalar). A position in space is a 3D quantity, but it does not
have a direction, thus it is not a vector. Figure 1.7 is an illustration of vector A in Cartesian

coordinates. It has three orthogonal components (Ax, Ay, Az) along the x, y and z directions,
respectively. To distinguish vectors from scalars, the letter representing the vector is printed
in bold, for example A or a, and a unit vector is printed in bold with a hat over the letter, for
example ˆx or ˆn.
The magnitude of vector A is given by
|A| = A =

A2x + A2y + A2z
(1.6)
Now let us consider two vectors A and B:
A = Ax ˆx + Ay ˆy + Azˆz
B = Bx ˆx + By ˆy + Bzˆz
The addition and subtraction of vectors can be expressed as
A + B = (Ax + Bx)ˆx + (Ay + By)ˆy + (Az + Bz)ˆz
A −B = (Ax −Bx)ˆx + (Ay −By)ˆy + (Az −Bz)ˆz
(1.7)
Obviously, the addition obeys the commutative law, that is A + B = B + A.
Figure 1.8 shows what the addition and subtraction mean geometrically. A vector may
be multiplied or divided by a scalar. The magnitude changes but its direction remains the
same. However, the multiplication of two vectors is complicated. There are two types of
multiplication: the dot product and the cross product.
The dot product of two vectors is deﬁned as
A rB = |A| |B| cos θ = Ax Bx + Ay By + Az Bz
(1.8)
where θ is the angle between vector A and vector B and cos θ is also called the direction
cosine. The dot r between A and B indicates the dot product, which results in a scalar; thus, it
is also called a scalar product. If the angle θ is zero, A and B are in parallel – the dot product is

The cross product of vectors A and B
maximized – whereas for an angle of 90 degrees, i.e. when A and B are orthogonal, the dot
product is zero.
It is worth noting that the dot product obeys the commutative law, that is, A rB = B rA.
The cross product of two vectors is deﬁned as
A × B = ˆn |A| |B| sin θ = C
= ˆx(Ay Bz −Az By) + ˆy(Az Bx −Ax Bz) + ˆz(Ax By −Ay Bx)
(1.9)
where ˆn is a unit vector normal to the plane containing A and B. The cross × between A
and B indicates the cross product, which results in a vector C; thus, it is also called a vector
product. The vector C is orthogonal to both A and B, and the direction of C follows a so-called
right-hand rule, as shown in Figure 1.9. If the angle θ is zero or 180 degrees, that is, A and B
are in parallel, the cross product is zero; whereas for an angle of 90 degrees, i.e. A and B are
orthogonal, the cross product of these two vectors reaches a maximum. Unlike the dot product,
the cross product does not obey the commutative law.
The cross product may be expressed in determinant form as follows, which is the same as
Equation (1.9) but may be easier for some people to memorize:
A × B =

ˆx
ˆy
ˆz
Ax
Ay
Az
Bx
By
Bz

(1.10)
Another important thing about vectors is that any vector can be decomposed into three
orthogonal components (such as x, y and z components) in 3D or two orthogonal components
in a 2D plane.
Example 1.1: Vector operation. Given vectors A = 10ˆx + 5ˆy + 1ˆz and B = 2ˆy, ﬁnd:
A + B; A −B; A • B; and A × B

10
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Solution:
A + B = 10ˆx + (5 + 2)ˆy + 1ˆz = 10ˆx + 7ˆy + 1ˆz;
A −B = 10ˆx + (5 −2)ˆy + 1ˆz = 10ˆx + 3ˆy + 1ˆz;
A • B = 0 + (5 × 2) + 0 = 10;
A × B = 10 × 2ˆz + 1 × 2ˆx = 20ˆz + 2ˆx
1.3.3 Coordinates
In addition to the well-known Cartesian coordinates, spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), as shown
in Figure 1.10, will also be used frequently throughout this book. These two coordinate systems
have the following relations:
x = r sin θ cos φ
y = r sin θ sin φ
z = r cos θ
(1.11)
and
r =

x2 + y2 + z2
θ = cos−1

Introduction

The dot products of unit vectors in these two coordinate systems are:
ˆx rˆr = sin θ cos φ; ˆy rˆr = sin θ sin φ; ˆz rˆr = cos θ
ˆx rˆθ = cos θ cos φ; ˆy rˆθ = cos θ sin φ; ˆz rˆθ = −sin θ
ˆx r ˆφ = −sin φ; ˆy r ˆφ = cos φ; ˆz r ˆφ = 0
(1.13)
Thus, we can express a quantity in one coordinate system using the known parameters in the
other coordinate system. For example, if Ar, Aθ, Aφ are known, we can ﬁnd
Ax = A rˆx = Ar sin θ cos φ + Aθ cos θ cos φ −Aφ sin φ
1.4 Basics of Electromagnetics
Now let us use basic mathematics to deal with antennas or, more precisely, electromagnetic
(EM) problems in this section.
EM waves cover the whole spectrum; radio waves and optical waves are just two examples
of EM waves. We can see light but we cannot see radio waves. The whole spectrum is divided
into many frequency bands. Some radio frequency bands are listed in Table 1.1.
Although the whole spectrum is inﬁnite, the useful spectrum is limited and some frequency
bands, such as the UHF, are already very congested. Normally, signiﬁcant license fees have to
be paid to use the spectrum, although there are some license-free bands: the most well-known
ones are the industrial, science and medical (ISM) bands. The 433 MHz and 2.45 GHz are just
two examples. Cable operators do not need to pay the spectrum license fees, but they have to
pay other fees for things such as digging out the roads to bury the cables.
The wave velocity, v, is linked to the frequency, f , and wavelength, λ, by this simple
equation:
v = λ
f
(1.14)
It is well known that the speed of light (an EM wave) is about 3 × 108 m/s in free space. The
higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. An illustration of how the frequency is linked

Frequency vs wavelength
to the wavelength is given in Figure 1.11, where both the frequency and wavelength are plotted
on a logarithmic scale. The advantage of doing this is that we can see clearly how the function
is changed, even over a very large scale.
Logarithmic scales are widely used in RF (radio frequency) engineering and the antennas
community since the signals we are dealing with change signiﬁcantly (over 1000 times in
many cases) in terms of the magnitude. The signal power is normally expressed in dB and is
deﬁned as
P(dBW) = 10 log10
P(W)
1W ; P(dBm) = 10 log10
P(W)
1mW
(1.15)
Thus, 100 watts is 20 dBW, just expressed as 20 dB in most cases. 1 W is 0 dB or 30 dBm
and 0.5 W is −3 dB or 27 dBm. Based on this deﬁnition, we can also express other parameters
in dB. For example, since the power is linked to voltage V by P = V 2
R (so P ∝V 2), the
voltage can be converted to dBV by
V (dBV ) = 20 log10
V (V )
1V

(1.16)
Thus, 3 kVolts is 70 dBV and 0.5 Volts is –6 dBV (not −3 dBV) or 54 dBmV.
1.4.1 The Electric Field
The electric ﬁeld (in V/m) is deﬁned as the force (in Newtons) per unit charge (in Coulombs).
From this deﬁnition and Coulomb’s law, the electric ﬁeld, E, created by a single point

Introduction
13
charge Q at a distance r is
E = F
Q =
Q
4πεr2 ˆr (V/m)
(1.17)
where
F is the electric force given by Coulomb’s law (F = Q1Q2
4πεr2 ˆr);
ˆris a unit vector along the r direction, which is also the direction of the electric ﬁeld E;
ε is the electric permittivity (it is also called the dielectric constant, but is normally a function
of frequency and not really a constant, thus permittivity is preferred in this book) of the
material. Its SI unit is Farads/m. In free space, it is a constant:
ε0 = 8.85419 × 10−12 F/m
(1.18)
The product of the permittivity and the electric ﬁeld is called the electric ﬂux density, D,
which is a measure of how much electric ﬂux passes through a unit area, i.e.
D = εE = εrε0E(C/m2)
(1.19)
where εr = ε/ε0 is called the relative permittivity or relative dielectric constant. The relative
permittivities of some common materials are listed in Table 1.2. Note that they are functions
of frequency and temperature. Normally, the higher the frequency, the smaller the permittivity
in the radio frequency band. It should also be pointed out that almost all conductors have a
relative permittivity of one.
The electric ﬂux density is also called the electric displacement, hence the symbol D. It is
also a vector. In an isotropic material (properties independent of direction), D and E are in
the same direction and ε is a scalar quantity. In an anisotropic material, D and E may be in
different directions if ε is a tensor.
If the permittivity is a complex number, it means that the material has some loss. The complex
permittivity can be written as
ε = ε′ −jε′′
(1.20)
The ratio of the imaginary part to the real part is called the loss tangent, that is
tan δ = ε′′
ε′
(1.21)
It has no unit and is also a function of frequency and temperature.
The electric ﬁeld E is related to the current density J (in A/m2), another important parameter,
by Ohm’s law. The relationship between them at a point can be expressed as
J = σ E
(1.22)
where σ is the conductivity, which is the reciprocal of resistivity. It is a measure of a material’s
ability to conduct an electrical current and is expressed in Siemens per meter (S/m). Table 1.3

lists conductivities of some common materials linked to antenna engineering. The conductivity
is also a function of temperature and frequency.
1.4.2 The Magnetic Field
Whilst charges can generate an electric ﬁeld, currents can generate a magnetic ﬁeld. The
magnetic ﬁeld, H (in A/m), is the vector ﬁeld which forms closed loops around electric currents
or magnets. The magnetic ﬁeld from a current vector I is given by the Biot–Savart law as
H = I × ˆr
4πr2 (A/m)
(1.23)
where
ˆr is the unit displacement vector from the current element to the ﬁeld point and
r is the distance from the current element to the ﬁeld point.
I, ˆr and H follow the right-hand rule; that is, H is orthogonal to both I and ˆr, as illustrated
by Figure 1.12.
Like the electric ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld exerts a force on electric charge. But unlike an
electric ﬁeld, it employs force only on a moving charge, and the direction of the force is
orthogonal to both the magnetic ﬁeld and the charge’s velocity:
F = Qv × μH
(1.24)
where
F is the force vector produced, measured in Newtons;
Q is the electric charge that the magnetic ﬁeld is acting on, measured in Coulombs (C);
v is the velocity vector of the electric charge Q, measured in meters per second (m/s);
μ is the magnetic permeability of the material. Its unit is Henries per meter (H/m). In free
space, the permeability is
μ0 = 4π × 10−7 H/m
(1.25)
In Equation (1.24), Qv can actually be viewed as the current vector I and the product of
μH is called the magnetic ﬂux density B (in Tesla), the counterpart of the electric ﬂux density.

Thus
B = μH
(1.26)
Again, in an isotropic material (properties independent of direction), B and H are in the same
direction and μ is a scalar quantity. In an anisotropic material, B and E may be in different
directions and μ is a tensor.
Like the relative permittivity, the relative permeability is given as
μr = μ/μ0
(1.27)
The relative permeabilities of some materials are given in Table 1.4. Permeability is not
sensitive to frequency or temperature. Most materials, including conductors, have a relative
permeability very close to one.
Combining Equations (1.17) and (1.24) yields
F = Q(E + v × μH)
(1.28)
This is called the Lorentz force. The particle will experience a force due to the electric ﬁeld
QE, and the magnetic ﬁeld Qv × B.
1.4.3 Maxwell’s Equations
Maxwell’s equations are a set of equations ﬁrst presented as a distinct group in the latter
half of the nineteenth century by James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), pictured in Figure 1.13.
Mathematically they can be expressed in the following differential form:
∇× E = −d B
dt
∇× H = J + d D
dt
∇rD = ρ
∇rB = 0
(1.29)
where
ρ is the charge density;
∇=
∂
∂x ˆx + ∂
∂y ˆy + ∂
∂z ˆz is a vector operator;

Introduction
17
Figure 1.13
James Clerk Maxwell
∇× is the curl operator, called rot in some countries instead of curl;
∇r is the divergence operator.
Here we have both the vector cross product and dot product.
Maxwell’s equations describe the interrelationship between electric ﬁelds, magnetic ﬁelds,
electric charge and electric current. Although Maxwell himself was not the originator of the
individual equations, he derived them again independently in conjunction with his molecular
vortex model of Faraday’s lines of force, and he was the person who ﬁrst grouped these equa-
tions together into a coherent set. Most importantly, he introduced an extra term to Ampere’s
Circuital Law, the second equation of (1.19). This extra term is the time derivative of the
electric ﬁeld and is known as Maxwell’s displacement current. Maxwell’s modiﬁed version
of Ampere’s Circuital Law enables the set of equations to be combined together to derive the
electromagnetic wave equation, which will be further discussed in Chapter 3.
Now let us have a closer look at these mathematical equations to see what they really mean
in terms of the physical explanations.
1.4.3.1 Faraday’s Law of Induction
∇× E = dB
dt
(1.30)
This equation simply means that the induced electromotive force is proportional to the rate of
change of the magnetic ﬂux through a coil. In layman’s terms, moving a conductor (such as
a metal wire) through a magnetic ﬁeld produces a voltage. The resulting voltage is directly
proportional to the speed of movement. It is apparent from this equation that a time-varying
magnetic ﬁeld (μ d H
dt ̸= 0) will generate an electric ﬁeld, i.e. E ̸= 0. But if the magnetic ﬁeld
is not time-varying, it will NOT generate an electric ﬁeld.

18
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
1.4.3.2 Ampere’s Circuital Law
∇× H = J + dD
dt
(1.31)
This equation was modiﬁed by Maxwell by introducing the displacement current d D
dt . It means
that a magnetic ﬁeld appears during the charge or discharge of a capacitor. With this concept,
and Faraday’s law, Maxwell was able to derive the wave equations, and by showing that the
predicted wave velocity was the same as the measured velocity of light, Maxwell asserted that
light waves are electromagnetic waves.
This equation shows that both the current (J) and time-varying electric ﬁeld (ε dE
dt ) can
generate a magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. H ̸= 0.
1.4.3.3 Gauss’s Law for Electric Fields
∇rD = ρ
(1.32)
This is the electrostatic application of Gauss’s generalized theorem, giving the equivalence
relation between any ﬂux, e.g. of liquids, electric or gravitational, ﬂowing out of any closed
surface and the result of inner sources and sinks, such as electric charges or masses enclosed
within the closed surface. As a result, it is not possible for electric ﬁelds to form a closed loop.
Since D = εE, it is also clear that charges (ρ) can generate electric ﬁelds, i.e. E ̸= 0.
1.4.3.4 Gauss’s Law for Magnetic Fields
∇rB = 0
(1.33)
This shows that the divergence of the magnetic ﬁeld (∇rB) is always zero, which means that
the magnetic ﬁeld lines are closed loops; thus, the integral of B over a closed surface is zero.
For a time-harmonic electromagnetic ﬁeld (which means a ﬁeld linked to time by factor e jωt
where ω is the angular frequency and t is the time), we can use the constitutive relations
D = εE,
B = μH,
J = σ E
(1.34)
to write Maxwell’s equations in the following form
∇× E = −jωμH
∇× H = J + jωεE = jωε

1 −j σ
ωε
	
E
∇rE = ρ/ε
∇rH = 0
(1.35)
where B and D are replaced by the electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld H to simplify the
equations and they will not appear again unless necessary.

Introduction
19
It should be pointed out that, in Equation (1.35), ε(1 −j σ
ωε) can be viewed as a complex
permittivity deﬁned by Equation (1.20). In this case, the loss tangent is
tan δ = ε′′
ε′ = σ
ωε
(1.36)
It is hard to predict how the loss tangent changes with the frequency, since both the permit-
tivity and conductivity are functions of frequency as well. More discussion will be given in
Chapter 3.

Consider the boundary between two materials shown in Figure 1.14. Using these equations,
we can obtain a number of useful results. For example, if we apply the ﬁrst equation of
Maxwell’s equations in integral form to the boundary between Medium 1 and Medium 2, it is
not difﬁcult to obtain [2]:
ˆn × E1 = ˆn × E2
(1.38)
where ˆn is the surface unit vector from Medium 2 to Medium 1, as shown in Figure 1.14. This
condition means that the tangential components of an electric ﬁeld (ˆn × E) are continuous
across the boundary between any two media.

Similarly, we can apply the other three Maxwell equations to this boundary to obtain:
ˆn × (H1 −H2) = Js
ˆn r(ε1E1 −ε2E2) = ρs
ˆn r(μ1H1 −μ2H2) = 0
(1.39)
where Js is the surface current density and ρs is the surface charge density. These results can
be interpreted as
r the change in tangential component of the magnetic ﬁeld across a boundary is equal to the
surface current density on the boundary;

We can also use these results to illustrate, for example, the ﬁeld distribution around a two-

is from positive charges to negative charges, whilst the magnetic ﬁeld forms loops around the

1.5 Summary
In this chapter we have introduced the concept of antennas, brieﬂy reviewed antenna history
and laid down the mathematical foundations for further study. The focus has been on the basics
of electromagnetics, which include electric and magnetic ﬁelds, electromagnetic properties of
materials, Maxwell’s equations and boundary conditions. Maxwell’s equations have revealed
how electric ﬁelds, magnetic ﬁelds and sources (currents and charges) are interlinked. They
are the foundation of electromagnetics and antennas.

Circuit Concepts and
Transmission Lines
In this chapter we are going to review the very basics of circuit concepts and distinguish
the lumped element system from the distributed element system. The focus will be on the
fundamentals of transmission lines, including the basic model, the characteristic impedance,
input impedance, reﬂection coefﬁcient, return loss and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of
a transmission line. The Smith Chart, impedance-matching techniques, Q factor and bandwidth
will also be addressed. A comparison of various transmission lines and associated connectors
will be made at the end of this chapter.
2.1 Circuit Concepts
Figure 2.1 shows a very basic electrical circuit where a voltage source V is connected to a
load Z via conducting wires. This simple circuit can represent numerous systems in our daily
life, from a simple torch – a DC (direct current) circuit – to a more complicated power supply
system – an AC (alternating current) circuit. To analyze such a circuit, one has to use the
following four quantities:
r Electric current I is a measure of the charge ﬂow/movement. The SI unit of current is the
Ampere (A), which is equal to a ﬂow of one Coulomb of charge per second.
r Voltage V is the difference in electrical potential between two points of an electrical or
electronic circuit. The SI unit of voltage is the Volt (V). Voltage measures the potential
energy of an electric ﬁeld to cause an electric current in a circuit.
r Impedance Z = R + j X is a measure of opposition to an electric current. In general, the
impedance is a complex number, its real part R is the electrical resistance (or just resistance)
and reﬂects the ability to consume energy, whilst the imaginary part X is the reactance
and indicates the ability to store energy. If the reactance is positive, it is called inductance
since the reactance of an inductor is positive (ωL); if the reactance is negative, it is then

Figure 2.1
A simple electrical circuit with a source and load
called capacitance since the reactance of a capacitor is negative (−1/ωC). The same unit,
the Ohm (), is used for impedance, resistance and reactance. The inverses of the impedance,
resistance and reactance are called the admittance (Y), conductance (G) and susceptance
(B), respectively. Their unit is the Siemens (S) and it is 1 Ohm.
r Power P is deﬁned as the amount of work done by an electrical current, or the rate at which
electrical energy is transmitted/consumed. The SI unit of power is the Watt (W). When an
electric current ﬂows through a device with resistance, the device converts the power into
various forms, such as light (light bulbs), heat (electric cooker), motion (electric razor),
sound (loudspeaker) or radiation for an antenna.
Ohm’s law is the fundamental theory for electrical circuits. It reveals how the current,
voltage and resistance are linked in a DC circuit. It states that the current passing through a
conductor/device from one terminal point on the conductor/device to another terminal point
on the conductor/device is directly proportional to the potential difference (i.e. voltage) across
the two terminal points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor/device
between the two terminal points. That is
I = V
R
(2.1)
In an AC circuit, Ohm’s law can be generalized as
I = V
Z
(2.2)
i.e. the resistance R is replaced by the impedance Z. Since the impedance is a complex number,
both the current and voltage can be complex numbers as well, which means that they have
magnitude and phase.

2.1.1 Lumped and Distributed Element Systems
In traditional circuit theory, we basically divide circuits into those that are DC and those that are
AC. The voltage, current and impedance are real numbers in DC circuits but complex numbers
in AC circuits. The effects of conducting wires can normally be neglected. For example, the
current across the load Z in Figure 2.1 can be obtained using Ohm’s law. It is given by Equation
(2.2) and considered to be the same voltage across the load.
In most countries, the electrical power supply system operates at 50 or 60 Hz, which means
a wavelength of 6000 or 5000 km (close to the radius of the Earth: 6378 km), much longer
than any transmission line in use. The current and voltage along the transmission line may
be considered unchanged. The system is called a lumped element system. However, in some
applications the frequency of the source is signiﬁcantly increased, as a result the wavelength
becomes comparable with the length of the transmission line linking the source and the load.
The current and voltage along the transmission line are functions of the distance from the
source, thus the system is called a distributed element system. If Figure 2.1 is a distributed
element system, Equation (2.2) is no longer valid since the voltage across the load may now be
very different from the source voltage. V0 should therefore be replaced by the voltage across
the load.
Conventional circuit theory was developed for lumped element systems whose frequency
is relatively low and where the wavelength is relatively large. However, the frequency of
a distributed system is relatively high and the wavelength is relatively short. It is therefore
importanttointroducethetransmissionlinetheory,whichhasbeendevelopedforthedistributed

2.2 Transmission Line Theory
A transmission line is the structure that forms all or part of a path from one place to another
for directing the transmission of energy, such as electrical power transmission and optical
waves. Examples of transmission lines include conducting wires, electrical power lines, coaxial
cables, dielectric slabs, optical ﬁbers and waveguides. In this book we are only interested in the
transmission lines for RF engineering and antenna applications. Thus, dielectric transmission
lines such as optical ﬁbers are not considered.
2.2.1 Transmission Line Model
The simplest transmission line is a two-wire conducting transmission line, as shown in Figure
2.2. It has been widely used for electrical power supply and also for radio and television
systems. In the old days, the broadcasting TV signal was received by an antenna and then
passed down to a TV via such a two-wire conducting wire, which has now been replaced by
the coaxial cable. This is partially due to the fact that the antenna used now (the Yagi–Uda
antenna, a popular TV antenna to be discussed in Chapter 5, which has an input impedance
around 75 ohms) is different from the antenna used then (the folded dipole, which was a
popular TV antenna many years ago and had an input impedance around 300 ohms). Also, the
coaxial cable performs much better than the two-wire transmission line at the UHF (ultra-high
frequency) TV bands.

A two-wire transmission line model
As shown in Figure 2.2, if we divide the transmission line into many (almost inﬁnite) short
segments of length z, which is much smaller than the wavelength of interest, each segment can
then be represented using a set of lumped elements. By doing so, a distributed transmission line
is modeled as an inﬁnite series of two-port lumped elementary components, each representing
an inﬁnitesimally short segment of the transmission line. To make the analysis easier, the
equivalent circuit of the segment of the transmission line is simpliﬁed to Figure 2.3, where
R = R1 + R2 and L = L1 + L2.
r The resistance R represents the conductive loss of the transmission line over a unit length,
thus the unit is ohms/unit length (/m).
r The inductance L is the self-inductance of the transmission line and is expressed in Henries
per unit length (H/m).
r The capacitance C between the two conductors is represented by a shunt capacitor with a
unit of Farads per unit length (F/m).
r The conductance G of the dielectric material separating the two conductors is represented
by a conductance G shunted between the two conductors. Its unit is Siemens per unit length
(S/m).

It should be repeated for clarity that the model consists of an inﬁnite series of elements
shown in Figure 2.3, and that the values of the components are speciﬁed per unit length. R, L,
C and G may be functions of frequency.
Using this model we are going to investigate how the current and voltage along the line are
changed and how they are linked to R, L, C and G.
It is reasonable to assume that the source is time-harmonic and has an angular frequency
ω(= 2π f, where f is the frequency), thus its time factor is e jωt.
Using Ohm’s law, we know that the voltage drop and current change over a segment of z
can be expressed in the frequency domain as:
V (z + z) −V (z) = −(R + jωL)z · I(z)
I(z + z) −I(z) = −(G + jωC)z · V (z + z)
(2.4)
When z approaches zero, these two equations can be written in differential form as:
dV (z)
dz
= −(R + jωL) · I(z)
dI(z)
dz
= −(G + jωC) · V (z)
(2.5)
Differentiating with respect to z on both sides of the equations and combining them gives:
d2V (z)
dz2
= (R + jωL)(G + jωC) · V (z)
d2I(z)
dz2
= (R + jωL)(G + jωC) · I(z)
(2.6)
That is,
d2V (z)

−γ 2V (z) = 0

−γ 2I(z) = 0
(2.7)
where
γ =

(R + jωL)(G + jωC)
(2.8)
and is called the propagation constant, which may have real and imaginary parts. Equation
(2.7) is a pair of linear differential equations which describe the line voltage and current on a
transmission line as a function of distance and time (the time factor e jωt is omitted here). They
are called telegraph equations or transmission line equations.

28
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
2.2.2 Solutions and Analysis
The general solution of V (z) in the telegraph equations can be expressed as the sum of the
forward and reverse voltages [1, 2]
V (z) = V+(z) + V−(z) = A1e−γ z + A2eγ z
(2.9)
where A1 and A2 are complex coefﬁcients to be determined by the boundary conditions, which
means the voltage, current and impedance at the input and the load of the transmission line –
we need to know at least two of these in order to determine the two coefﬁcients.
Replacing V (z) in Equation (2.5) by Equation (2.9), we can ﬁnd the solution of the line
current as
I(z) =
γ
R + jωL (A1e−γ z −A2eγ z)
(2.10)
This can be written as
I(z) = 1
Z0
(A1e−γ z −A2eγ z)
(2.11)
where
Z0 = V+(z)
I+(z) = R + jωL
γ
=

R + jωL
G + jωC
(2.12)
and is the ratio of the forward voltage to the current thus it is called the characteristic
impedance of the transmission line. Its unit is the ohm (). It is a function of the frequency and
parameters of the line. The industrial standard transmission line normally has a characteristic
impedance of 50 or 75  when the loss can be neglected (R ≈0 and G ≈0).
Since the propagation constant is complex, it can be written as:
γ = α + jβ
(2.13)
where α is called the attenuation constant (in Nepers/meter, or Np/m) and β is called the phase
constant. Because γ = √(R + jωL)(G + jωC), we can ﬁnd that mathematically:
α =

Forward- and reverse-traveling waves
If we take the time factor into account, the complete solution of the voltage and current
along a transmission line can be expressed as
V (z, t) = A1e jωt−γ z + A2e jωt+γ z = A1e−αz+ j(ωt−βz) + A2eαz+ j(ωt+βz)
I(z, t) =

Z0 (A1e jωt−γ z −A2e jωt+γ z) =
1
Z0 (A1e−αz+ j(ωt−βz) −A2eαz+ j(ωt+βz))
(2.15)
Physically, the line voltage solution can be considered the combination of two traveling
voltage waves: the wave traveling towards the z direction (called the forward wave) has an
amplitude of |V+(z)| =
A1e−αz, which attenuates as z increases, whereas the wave traveling
towards the –z direction (called the reverse wave) has an amplitude of |A2eαz|, as shown in
Figure 2.4. The amplitudes of A1 and A2 are actually the voltage amplitudes of the forward and
reverse waves at z = 0, respectively. If there is no reﬂection at the end of the transmission line,
it means that the boundary conditions have forced A2 to be zero, thus the reverse wave will be
zero and only the forward-traveling voltage will exist on the transmission line in this case.
Similarly, the line current can also be viewed as the combination of two traveling current
waves. It is worth noting that the reverse-traveling current has a minus sign with the amplitude,
this means a phase change of 180 degrees and reﬂects the direction change in the returned
current.
The velocity of the wave is another parameter of interest and it can be determined from the
phase term: ωt −βz. At a ﬁxed reference point, the wave moves z over a period of t, i.e.
we have ωt −βz = 0, thus the velocity
v = dz
dt = ω
β
(2.16)
Since the phase constant β is a function of the angular frequency, as shown in Equation
(2.14), the velocity is a function of frequency, which is a well-known dispersion problem
(change with frequency).
Using Equation (2.16), the phase constant can be expressed as
β = ω
v = 2π f
v
= 2π
λ
(2.17)
where λ is the wavelength. The phase constant is also called the wave number. For every one
wavelength, the phase is changed by 2π.

30
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
These solutions are general and can be applied to any transmission line in principle. We can
see that the characteristic impedance may be complex and the attenuation constant and phase
constant are complicated functions of frequency. But, in practice, we always prefer something
simpler and easier to use.
2.2.2.1 Lossless Transmission Lines
Since the function of the transmission line is to transmit information from one place to another
with little change, the loss of the transmission line should be minimized – this is one of the
requirements for transmission line manufacture. There are indeed many low-loss transmission
lines available on the market.
For a lossless transmission line, elements R and G can be considered to be zero (R ≈0 and
G ≈0). In this hypothetical case, the model depends only on elements L and C, which greatly
simpliﬁes the analysis.
The characteristic impedance of the transmission line, Equation (2.12), can now be simpliﬁed
to
Z0 =
	
L
C
(2.18)
This is just a real number (resistance) and is determined only by L and C; it is not a function
of the frequency.
Similarly, Equation (2.14) becomes
α = 0
β = ω
√
LC
(2.19)
This means that there is no attenuation and the propagation constant is now just an imaginary
number:
γ = jβ = jω
√
LC
The voltage and current along the line are
V (z, t) = A1e j(ωt−βz) + A2e j(ωt+βz)
I(z, t) =
1
Z0 (A1e j(ωt−βz) −A2e j(ωt+βz))
(2.20)
Neither the forward nor the reverse wave is attenuated and their amplitudes are not a function
of the distance.
The velocity of the waves is now
v = ω
β =
1
√
LC
(2.21)
which is not a function of the frequency and is only determined by the transmission line
itself–no dispersion. This is an important feature required for all transmission lines.

2.2.2.2 Low-Loss Transmission Lines
In practice, most transmission lines cannot be considered lossless structures but, instead, are
low-loss transmission lines.
The deﬁnition of ‘low loss’ is
R ≪ωL,
G ≪ωC
This seems to imply extremely high frequency. The reality is that both R and G are functions
of frequency. Normally, the higher the frequency, the larger R and G. Thus, this condition does
not mean high frequency. It applies for any frequency when this condition is met.
For a low-loss transmission line, the characteristic impedance is
Z0 =

R + jωL
G + jωC =

jωL(1 + R/jωL)
jωC(1 + G/jωC) ≈

jωL(1 + 0)
jωC(1 + 0) =
	
L
C
(2.22)
Thus, it is the same as the lossless case. The characteristic impedance is a pure resistance and
is determined by L and C; it is not a function of the frequency. This is why the characteristic
impedance of industrial standard transmissions has a constant value, normally 50 or 75 ohms,
over a large frequency band, even when the line loss is not zero.
Similarly, the attenuation and phase constants can be approximated as
α ≈R


C/L + G
2

L/C =
R
2Z0
+ GZ0
2
β ≈ω
√
LC
(2.23)
The loss (attenuation) is caused by the resistive loss R and the material loss G between the
conductors. The phase constant is again the same as for lossless lines.
However, the voltage and current are attenuated as they travel along the line (due to the loss)
and can be expressed as
V (z, t) = A1e−αz+ j(ωt−βz) + A2eαz+ j(ωt+βz)
I(z, t) = 1
Z0
(A1e−αz+ j(ωt−βz) −A2eαz+ j(ωt+βz))
(2.24)
where the attenuation constant is given by Equation (2.23).
Just like the lossless line, the velocity of the waves in a low-loss transmission line is only
determined by L and C, i.e.
v = ω
β =
1

LC
(2.25)
There is no dispersion (it is not changed with frequency).

A transmission line terminated with a load
2.2.3 Terminated Transmission Line
It is now clear that the voltage and current of a transmission line are distributed quantities; they
are functions of the position z. However, the characteristic impedance of a transmission line is
not a distributed parameter but a constant. When the line is terminated with a load impedance
ZL, as shown in Figure 2.5, what is the input impedance?
2.2.3.1 Input Impedance
The input impedance of a transmission line is deﬁned as the ratio of voltage to current at the
input port and is the impedance looking towards the load, i.e.
Zin(z) = V (z)
I(z) = Z0
A1e−γ z + A2eγ z
A1e−γ z −A2eγ z = Z0
e−γ z + 
0eγ z
e−γ z −
0eγ z
(2.26)
where 
0 = A2

A1 is called the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the load and is equal to the ratio of A2
to A1, which are the complex coefﬁcients of the forward and reverse voltage waves at z = 0.
The input impedance at the load should be the load impedance, that is
Zin(0) = Z0
1 + 
0
1 −
0
= ZL
(2.27)
Thus, the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the load can be expressed as

0 = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
(2.28)
A general expression of the reﬂection coefﬁcient on a transmission line at reference point z
is

(z) = V−(z)
V+(z) = A2eγ z
A1e−γ z = 
0e2γ z = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
e2γ z
(2.29)
This means that the reﬂection coefﬁcient is a distributed parameter and is a function of the
load impedance as well as the transmission line characteristic impedance.

Circuit Concepts and Transmission Lines
33
Replacing 
0 in Equation (2.26) by Equation (2.28), we have
Zin(z) = Z0
(ZL + Z0)e−γ z + (ZL −Z0)eγ z
(ZL + Z0)e−γ z −(ZL −Z0)eγ z
= Z0
ZL(eγ z + e−γ z) −Z0(eγ z −e−γ z)
Z0(eγ z + e−γ z) −ZL(eγ z −e−γ z)
Thus
Zin(z) = Z0
ZL −Z0 tanh(γ z)
Z0 −ZL tanh(γ z)
(2.30)
where
tanh(γ z) = eγ z −e−γ z
eγ z + e−γ z
(2.31)
is the hyperbolic tangent function.
In practice, the input impedance is measured at a given distance l rather than at its z-axis
value, as shown in Figure 2.5. Thus, the input impedance at l meters away from the load is
Zin(l) = Z0
ZL + Z0 tanh(γl)
Z0 + ZL tanh(γl)
(2.32)
Note that there is a sign change from Equation (2.30) since the distance should not be
negative and we have used l = −z and tanh(−γl) = −tanh(γl).
If the loss of the transmission line can be neglected, that is γ ≈jβ, Equation (2.32) can be
simpliﬁed to
Zin(l) = Z0
ZL + j Z0 tan(βl)
Z0 + j ZL tan(βl)
(2.33)
This is a very useful equation. Special attention should be paid to the following cases:
r Matched case: ZL = Z0
Zin(l) = Z0, the input impedance is the same as the characteristic impedance and is not a
function of the length of the line.
r Open circuit: ZL = ∞
Zin(l) = Z0
1
j tan(βl)
(2.34)
The input impedance has no resistance, just reactance (capacitive for small l).
r Short circuit: ZL = 0
Zin(l) = j Z0 tan(βl)
(2.35)
Again, the input impedance has no resistance, just reactance (inductive for small l).

34
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
r Quarter-wavelength case: l = λ/4
Zin(l) = Z2
0
ZL
(2.36)
This special case is called the quarter-wavelength transform since the load impedance is
transformed (after a quarter wavelength) to the input impedence given by this simple equation.
It is often used for impedance-matching purposes.
It should be pointed out that, in calculating the wavelength λ and wave number β = 2π/λ,
the wavelength inside the transmission line is generally different from that in free space. The
dielectric properties of the material of the transmission line have to be taken into account when
doing such a calculation. The simplest case is that the wavelength is linked to the relative
permittivity εr (also called the relative dielectric constant) of the material by
λ = λ0
√εr
(2.37)
where λ0 is the free space wavelength. More details will be given later in this chapter.
Example 2.1: Input impedance. A lossless transmission line with a characteristic impedance
of 50  is loaded by a 75  resistor. Plot the input impedance as a function of the line length
(up to two wavelengths).
Solution:
Since it is a lossless transmission line, Equation (2.33) is employed to calculate the input
impedance. The result is shown in Figure 2.6 where both the resistance and reactance are
plotted as a function of the normalized (to wavelength) line length. It is apparent that

r The input impedance is a periodic function of the line length. The period is half of a wave-
length.
r The input impedance is a complex number even when the load impedance is a pure resistance.
The resistance changes between 75  and 33 , whilst the reactance changes between
−20  and +20 .
r There are two resonant points (where the reactance is zero) over one period. These are at
l/λ = 0 and 0.25 in this case.
r When 0 < l/λ < 0.25, the reactance is negative, i.e. capacitive. When 0.25 < l/λ < 0.5, the
reactance is positive, i.e. inductive.
Example 2.2: Input impedance of a low-loss transmission line. A 75  resistor is now
connected to a good transmission line with characteristic impedance of 50 . The attenuation
constant is not zero but 0.2 Np/m at 1 GHz. Plot the input impedance as a function of the line
length (up to 2λ). Assume that the effective relative permittivity is 1.5.
Solution:
For a low-loss transmission line, the characteristic impedance is still a constant (= 50  in
this case). The line length changes from 0 to 2λ. Since the effective relative permittivity is 1.5
and the frequency is 1 GHz, the wavelength in the medium is
λ =

= 3 × 108

≈0.245 (m)
Thus, the length l is from 0 to 0.49 m.
The propagation constant is γ = α + jβ = 0.2 + j2π/λ. Using Equation (2.32), we can
plot the input impedance, as shown in Figure 2.7. It can be seen that the only change is that the
input impedance is no longer a periodic function of the line length. However, it still exhibits a
period feature if we neglect the amplitude changes. All other features remain the same as in
the lossless case.

Since this is not a standard characteristic impedance of a transmission line, special dimen-
sions and/or materials will be needed to construct this line.
2.2.3.2 The Reﬂection Coefﬁcient and the Return Loss
The reﬂection coefﬁcient was deﬁned by Equation (2.29). If we replace the z-axis value by the
length of the line l, it can be rewritten as

(l) = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
e−2γl = 
0e−2γl
(2.38)
This is the voltage reﬂection coefﬁcient. Since the power is proportional to the voltage
squared, as shown in Equation (2.3), the power reﬂection coefﬁcient is

P(l) = |
(l)|2 = |
0|2 e−2αl
(2.39)
Both reﬂection coefﬁcients are a good measure of how much signal/power is reﬂected
back from the terminal. Obviously, when the load impedance is the same as the characteristic
impedance, they are both zero and that is the matched case.
When the voltage reﬂection coefﬁcient and power reﬂection coefﬁcient are expressed in
logarithmic forms, they give the same result, which is called the return loss:
L RT (l) = −20 log10(|
(l)|) = −10 log10(
P(l))
(2.40)
Since the return loss should not be smaller than zero, there is a minus sign in Equation (2.40)
(but in practice some people ignore the minus sign, which is not correct). A 3 dB return loss
corresponds to the reﬂection coefﬁcient being 1/
√
2 ≈0.707 or the power reﬂection coefﬁcient
being 0.5.
It is worth noting the following special cases for a lossless transmission line:
r Matched case: ZL = Z0

(l) = 
0 = 0 – the reﬂection is zero at any point of the line (even for a non-perfect trans-
mission line).
L RT = ∞dB – in practice, this means that the return loss is huge, say 50 dB.

Circuit Concepts and Transmission Lines
37
r Open circuit: ZL = ∞

0 = 1 and 
(l) = e−j2βl – the amplitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient is 1 at any point of the
line.
L RT = 0 dB – this means that all power is reﬂected back from the load.
r Short circuit: ZL = 0

0 = −1 and 
(l) = −e−j2βl – the amplitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient is 1 at any reference
point of the line; there is a phase shift of 180 degrees between the input and reﬂected voltages
at the end of the line.
L RT = 0 dB – again, this means that all power is reﬂected back from the load.
Example 2.4: Reﬂection coefﬁcient and return loss of a lossless transmission line. A 75 
resistor is connected to a lossless transmission line with characteristic impedance of 50 .
a. What is the voltage reﬂection coefﬁcient for l = 0 and λ/4, respectively?
b. What is the return loss for l = 0 and λ/4, respectively?
Solution:
For a lossless transmission line, the attenuation constant α is zero.
a. Using Equation (2.38), we have

(0) = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
= 75 −50
75 + 50 = 0.2
and

λ

= ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
e−2γl = 0.2e−j2∗2π/4 = 0.2e−jπ = −0.2
This means that the phase of the reﬂection coefﬁcient is changed by 180 degrees when the
length of the transmission line is increased by a quarter-wavelength.
b. The return loss can be obtained by using Equation (2.40), i.e.
L RT = −20 log10(|
(l)|) = −10 log10(
P(l)) = 13.98 d B
for l = 0 and λ/4, and actually any length of such a transmission line.
Example 2.5: Reﬂection coefﬁcient and return loss of a low-loss transmission line. A 75 
resistor is connected to a low-loss transmission line with characteristic impedance of 50 .
The attenuation constant is 0.2 Np/m at 1 GHz.

e−2γl = 0.2e−2∗0.2∗0.245/4−j2∗2π/4 = 0.1952e jπ = −0.1952
This means that not only the phase of the reﬂection coefﬁcient but also the amplitude is
changed when the length of the transmission line is increased by a quarter-wavelength.
b. The return loss can be obtained by using Equation (2.40), i.e.
L RT (0) = −20 log10(|
(l)|) = 13.98 dB
and
L RT

The return loss is slightly increased, as expected. Over two wavelengths, the change is
shown in Figure 2.8. It follows 0.2e−2αl and is a straight line on a logarithmic scale, i.e.
L RT (l) = 13.98 + 3.47l dB.
2.2.3.3 The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)
The VSWR (also known as the standing wave ratio, SWR) is deﬁned as the ratio of the
magnitude of the maximum voltage on the line to the magnitude of the minimum voltage on
the line, as shown in Figure 2.9. Mathematically, it can be expressed as
VSWR(l) = |V |max
|V |min
= |V+| + |V−|
|V+| −|V−| = 1 + |
(l)|
1 −|
(l)|
(2.41)
Obviously, the VSWR is just another measure of how well a transmission line is matched
with its load. Unlike the reﬂection coefﬁcient, the VSWR is a scalar and has no phase in-
formation. For a nonperfect transmission line, the VSWR is a function of the length of
the line (l) as well as the load impedance and the characteristic impedance of the line.
But for a lossless transmission line, the VSWR is the same at any reference point of the
line.

Thus, the VSWR of a line is bounded by unity and inﬁnity:
1 ≤VSWR ≤∞
For most applications, the VSWR is required to be smaller than 2, which is considered a
good match. But for the mobile phone industry, the desired VSWR is normally less than 3,
which is due to the considerable effects of the human body on the performance of mobile
phones.
Example 2.6: VSWR. A 75  resistor is connected to a transmission line of characteristic
impedance of 50 . What is the VSWR at the termination?
Solution:
The reﬂection coefﬁcient at the termination is

(0) = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
= 75 −50
75 + 50 = 0.2
Using Equation (2.41) gives
VSWR(0) = 1 + |
(0)|
1 −|
(0)| = 1.5
This is smaller than 2, thus this can be considered a very well-matched case.
In this section we have discussed the reﬂection coefﬁcient, the return loss and VSWR. All
these quantities are measures of impedance matching. Table 2.1 is a list of some typical values
to show how they are interrelated. It is interesting to note that, if ZL is a real number,

r when ZL/Z0 > 1, ZL/Z0 = VSWR;
r when ZL/Z0 < 1, ZL/Z0 = 1/VSWR.
However, if ZL is a complex number and its imaginary part is not zero, these simple relations
linking ZL/Z0 and VSWR do not hold. For example, for ZL = j50 ohms and Z0 = 50 ohms,
we have 
 = j, L RT = 0 dB and VSWR = ∞̸= ZL/Z0.
2.3 The Smith Chart and Impedance Matching
2.3.1 The Smith Chart
The Smith Chart, as shown in Figure 2.10, was invented by Phillip H. Smith (1905–1987) and
is a graphical aid designed for use by radio frequency (RF) engineers to solve transmission
line and matching circuit problems. Although computer-aided tools have grown steadily over
the years, the Smith Chart is still widely used today, not only as a problem-solving aid,
but as a graphical demonstrator of how RF parameters behave and an alternative to using
tabular information. The Smith Chart can be utilized to represent many parameters including
impedances, admittances, reﬂection coefﬁcients, scattering parameters, noise ﬁgure circles,
constant gain contours and regions for unconditional stability. It is most frequently used at, or
within, the unity radius region. However, the remainder is still mathematically relevant, being
used, for example, in oscillator design and stability analysis.
The Smith Chart is plotted on the complex reﬂection coefﬁcient plane in two dimensions,
as shown in Figure 2.11. The horizontal axis is the real part of the reﬂection coefﬁcient while
the vertical axis shows the imaginary part of the reﬂection coefﬁcient. The origin or center is

is shown and other circles are not displayed to make the chart simple and neat.
Most information shown on the standard Smith Chart is actually the normalized complex
impedance as shown in Figure 2.12: the resistance is displayed in circles and the reactance is
shown as arched lines.Theupperhalfspaceisinductivewhilstthelowerhalfspaceiscapacitive.
The middle line is pure resistance from 0 to inﬁnity. If a reference point on a transmission line
is moved away from the load (i.e. towards the source), this can be shown on the Smith Chart
as the impedance point is moved on the |
| (or VSWR) circle clockwise. When the reference
point is moved towards the load, it means that the impedance point is moved on the |
| circle
anti-clockwise. The distance is normalized to the wavelength.
The Smith Chart can also be shown in other forms, such as normalized admittance, which is
often known as the Y Smith Chart. In this book we are mainly interested in using the impedance
Smith Chart. Other forms which can be found in references such as [1] are not discussed in
this book.
As impedances change with frequency, problems using the Smith Chart can only be solved
manually using one frequency at a time, the result being represented by a point. This is often
adequate for narrowband applications (typically up to about 10% bandwidth) but for wide
bandwidths it is usually necessary to apply Smith Chart techniques at more than one frequency
across the operating frequency band. Provided that the frequencies are sufﬁciently close, the
resulting Smith Chart points may be joined by straight lines to create a locus. A locus of points
on a Smith Chart covering a range of frequencies can be employed to visually represent:
r how capacitive or inductive a load is across the frequency range;
r how difﬁcult matching is likely to be at various frequencies;
r how well matched a particular component is.
The accuracy of the Smith Chart is reduced for problems involving a large spread of
impedances, although the scaling can be magniﬁed for individual areas to accommodate these.

Example 2.7: Input impedance and reﬂection coefﬁcient. Use a Smith Chart to redo Example
2.1, and also display the reﬂection coefﬁcient on the chart.
Solution:
The characteristic impedance of the line is 50 , thus the normalized load impedance is
75/50 = 1.5, which can be uniquely identiﬁed as point A in the Smith Chart in Figure 2.13.
The distance from the origin (center) to A is 0.2, thus the reﬂection coefﬁcient |
| = 0.2.
Moving the reference plane away from this load means moving point A along the |
| = 0.2
circle clockwise into the capacitive half space, and then past the resonant point at R = 0.67
(i.e. 0.67 × 50  = 33.5 ) into the inductive half space. After 360 degrees (half wavelength),
it is back to A. Over this period, the normalized reactance changes between – 0.4 and +0.4,
i.e. −20  and +20 . The results are the same as in Example 2.1.

2.3.2 Impedance Matching
Impedance matching is the practice of making the output impedance of a source equal to the
input impedance of the load in order to maximize the power transfer and minimize reﬂections
from the load. Mathematically, it means the load impedance being the complex conjugate of
the source impedance. That is,
ZS = Z∗
L = (RL + j X L)∗= RL −j X L
(2.43)
When the imaginary part is zero, the two impedances are the same:
ZS = Z∗
L = ZL = RL
(2.44)
Normally, we can use either lumped networks or distributed networks to match impedance.
2.3.2.1 Lumped Matching Networks
Lumped matching networks can be divided into three basic types: the L network, the T network
and the pi (π) network. The aim of matching is to make the equivalent impedance of the network
the same as the desired resistance Rin – usually the characteristic impedance of a transmission
line. Generally speaking, resistors are not employed for impedance matching since the power
could be consumed by the resistor without making a useful contribution to the operation of the
system.
In Figure 2.14(a) an L network is employed to match the impedance Rin. It can be shown
that this impedance is linked to the network elements by the following equations:
B = ±
√
n −1
Rin
X = ± Rin
√
n −1
n
−X L
(2.45)
where n = Rin/RL and should be greater than 1. If this condition cannot be met, the second
lumped L network, shown in Figure 2.14(b), may be used. The components are interrelated by
YL = 1/ZL = GL + j BL
B = ±
√
m −1
mRin
−BL
(2.46)
X = ±Rin
√
m −1
where m = 1/(RinGL) and should be greater than 1.
It should be pointed out that lumped L networks have no degree of freedom to optimize the
bandwidth, whilst the bandwidth is actually a very important consideration of many applica-
tions. To resolve this problem, one should consider adding further reactive elements to create
T or π networks to optimize the overall bandwidth.

Figure 2.15 is a T network, which may be viewed as another reactance (jX2) added to the
L network in Figure 2.14(a). The design process can be summarized by the following three
steps:
Step 1: according to the load impedance and the desired bandwidth, choose X1,
B f = f
fo

|X1 + X L|
(2.47)
Step 2: since ZL and jX1 are in series, the composite load impedance can be obtained as
ZLN = ZL + jX1.
Step 3: use ZLN and the L network design in Equation (2.45) to ﬁnd B and X2.
Another option for impedance matching is to use a π network, as shown in Figure 2.16,
which can be seen as an admittance (jB2) added to the L network in Figure 2.14(b). The design
process is very similar to that of the T network. That is:

(2.48)
Step 2: since YL and jB1 are in parallel, the composite load admittance can be obtained as
YLN = YL + jB1.
Step 3: use YLN and the L network design in Equation (2.46) to ﬁnd X and B2.
Example 2.8: Impedance matching. A load with an impedance of 10 −j100  is to be
matched with a 50  transmission line. Design a matching network and discuss if there are
other solutions available.
Solution:
Since ZL = RL + j X L = 10 −j100 and n = Rin/RL = 50/10 = 5 > 1, the L network in
Figure 2.14(a) is a suitable matching network. Using Equation (2.45) we obtain

50 = ±0.04

Thus, there are two sets of solutions: (B,X) = (0.04, 120) and (B,X) = (−0.04, 80).
Now let us see if there are other possible solutions. Because YL = 1/(RL + j X L) ≈0.001 +
j0.001 and m = 1/(RinGL) = 1/0.05 = 20 > 1, we can also use the L network in Figure 2.14(b)
to match the impedance:

20 × 50 −0.001 ≈±0.0043 −0.001

Therefore, we have obtained another two sets of solutions: (B,X) = (0.0033, 217.9) and
(B,X) = (−0.0053, −217.9).
In addition, we can also use T and π networks to match the load with the transmission line
and the bandwidth can be controlled.

Circuit Concepts and Transmission Lines
47
It is apparent that, for a given load impedance, there is more than one matching network
available. In practice, the decision as to which network to adopt normally depends on some
other parameters such as the bandwidth (to be discussed in Example 2.9) and values of the
elements.
2.3.2.2 Distributed Matching Networks
Distributed matching networks can be formed by a quarter-wavelength transmission line, an
open-circuit transmission line, a short-circuit transmission line or their combinations. They
can be represented mathematically by Equations (2.34) to (2.36). The process is best visualized
on the Smith Chart.
The quarter-wavelength transformer mentioned earlier is a unique and popular narrowband
impedance-matching technique and the process is quite straightforward. The short- and open-
circuit stub tuning is very similar to the lumped matching circuit tuning: reactance and/or
admittance is added to the matching network. The example below is a good illustration of how
to realize matching using a distributed network.
Example 2.9: Impedance matching and bandwidth. A load with an impedance of 10 −
j100  is to be matched with a 50  transmission line. Design two distributed matching
networks and compare them in terms of the bandwidth performance.
Solution:
The normalized load impedance is:
zL = ZL/50 = 0.2 −j2
As shown in Figure 2.17, this corresponds to a unique point A on the Smith Chart. The
reﬂection coefﬁcient is

 = ZL −50
ZL + 50 = 0.5588 −j0.7353
|
| = 0.9235
The |
| = 0.9235 circle is shown in Figure 2.17 as a broken line. To match the impedance,
we can move this point (A) clockwise (towards the source) along this circle to points B1, B2,
B3 or B4, which are the crossover points with the circle of z = 1 or 1/z = 1. It can then be
further moved either along circle z = 1 or 1/z = 1 to the center O–the matching point. The
normalized admittances at B1 and B2 are −0.04 and +0.04, and the normalized reactances
at B3 and B4 are +217.9 and −217.9, respectively. These four routes correspond to the four
solutions from the L networks, as demonstrated in Example 2.8.
The matching network using B1 or B2 can be illustrated by Figure 2.18(a), where the open-
or short-circuit stub is in parallel with the load impedance, while the matching network using
B3 or B4 can be shown by Figure 2.18(b), where the open- or short-circuit stub is in series
with the load impedance. The rotational angles (from A to B1, B2, B3 or B4) on the Smith
Chart determine the stub lengths l1 and l2. There are at least four possible designs.

To design a matching network using B1 we can follow the steps below:
Step 1: Move from point A to B1, the rotational angle is about 0.582π (i.e. 104.8◦) on the
Smith Chart, which corresponds to l1 = 0.1455λ. Note that the rotational angle is twice βl1
(= 0.291π, not 0.582π, since the impedance period is π, not 2π). The impedance at point B1
is 0.0413 −j0.1984 while its admittance is 1.0 + j4.8318.
Step 2: Move from point B1 to the center O. This can be achieved easily using a stub
connected in parallel with the line, thus it is advantageous to work in admittances. The stub in
parallel with the line should produce a susceptance of −4.8318. This can be achieved by the
following two designs:
A. a short circuit with a stub length l2 = 0.0325λ;
B. an open circuit with a stub length l2 = 0.2825λ.
The stub length can also be obtained from the Smith Chart.
Now let us examine the bandwidth of these two designs. Assuming the center frequency is
1 GHz, we have l1 = 0.1455λ = 4.365 cm, and l2 = 0.0325λ = 0.975 cm for Design A, and
l2 = 0.2825λ = 8.475 cm for Design B. We can use the input impedance formula:
Zin(l) = Z0
ZL + j Z0 tan(βl)
Z0 + j ZL tan(βl)
and the following two equations:

 = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
VSWR = 1 + |
|
1 −|
|
to obtain the VSWR as a function of the frequency. The results are shown in Figure 2.19. It is
apparent that
r both designs have an excellent impedance match at the center frequency 1 GHz;
r the stub length of Design A is shorter than that of Design B whilst the bandwidth of Design
A is much wider than that of Design B. This is a very interesting and useful result.
Similar conclusions can be drawn from the matching networks built at the other points (B2,
B3 and B4). To build a distributed matching network, the length should be as short as possible
to maximize the bandwidth.
The frequency bandwidth limitation on matching networks has been investigated by many
people. There exists a general limit on the bandwidth over which an arbitrarily good impedance
match can be obtained in the case of a complex load impedance. It is related to the ratio of
reactance to resistance, and to the bandwidth over which we wish to match the load.
Figure 2.20 shows four load impedances (series RL, series RC, parallel RC and parallel RL)
with matching networks, which are speciﬁc examples of the L matching network discussed
earlier. Take the parallel RC load impedance as an example; Bode and Fano derived, for lumped

This is known as the Bode–Fano limit for parallel RC. Since ln(1) = 0, there is no contribution
to this integral over frequencies for |
| = 1, so it can be seen that it is desirable to have
the maximum mismatch outside the band of interest if a broad bandwidth is required. If this
condition is assumed, the integral is limited to the bandwidth of interest (ω), and we can get
an idea of how well we can match an arbitrary complex impedance over that bandwidth. For
an idealized case, this equation can be simpliﬁed to

There are similar limitations on other forms of complex impedance. A general implication
of the Bode–Fano limit is that one should not waste any match out-of-band, and that the best
in-band match is obtained with Tchebyscheff rather than maximally ﬂat networks. The best
broadband impedance-matching practice incorporates the complex load impedance into, for
example, a multisection ﬁlter structure with a design that includes the characteristics of the
load.
2.3.3 The Quality Factor and Bandwidth
The bandwidth is indeed a very important parameter for any electric/electronic component and
system. It is closely linked to the quality factor, Q, which is a measure of how much lossless
reactive energy is stored in a circuit compared to the average power dissipated.
Antenna bandwidth is maximized when the power dissipation is comparatively high. In
other words, a low Q is required for wide bandwidths. In turn, the extent to which this energy
is associated with radiation (rather than conductor or dielectric losses) determines the antenna
efﬁciency. For a circuit component such as an inductor or capacitor, we require the resistive
losses to be low; hence Q is required to be high. It is often the case that antennas and circuit
components have seemingly contradictory requirements: antennas are designed to have a low
Q, whereas circuit components are designed for a high Q.
The quality factor is quoted as being either unloaded or loaded. For the latter, the losses of
the external circuit – for example, the source – are included, whereas for the former they are
not. The unloaded quality factor, Q, is deﬁned as
Q ≡ω
(total energy stored)
(average power loss in the load) = ω WE + WM
PL
(2.51)
where WE is the energy stored in the electric ﬁeld, WM is the energy stored in the magnetic
ﬁeld and PL is the average power delivered to the load. The loaded quality factor, QL, can also
be given by Equation (2.51) but with PL replaced by the total power PT , which is dissipated
in both the external circuit and the load.
At resonance, the electric and magnetic ﬁeld energies have the same magnitudes and the
formulas simplify such that the unloaded quality factor at resonance Q0 is given by
Q0 ≡2ω0WE
PL
= 2ω0WM
PL
(2.52)
where ω0 is the angular resonant frequency (= 2π f0, where f0 is the resonant frequency).

There are many simpliﬁcations of these deﬁnitions that are widely used, but which only
truly apply when they are derived directly from the above. For example, a relation that is often
used is
Q0 =
f0
f2 −f1
= 1
BF
(2.53)
where f1 and f2 are the frequencies at which the power reduces to half of its maximum value
at the resonant frequency, f0, and where BF is the fractional bandwidth. This relation only
truly applies to simple circuits, but is considered to be a good approximation to a wide range
of unloaded conﬁgurations. It has the advantage of providing a simple relationship between Q
and fractional bandwidth, but we will see later that it only accurately applies to simple, single
resonant circuits and should therefore be used with some care. The derivation of this relation
is illustrated below.
Consider the series resonant circuit shown in Figure 2.21. The power dissipated in the
resistance R is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the current I. This is plotted in
Figure 2.22 with R = 50 , L = 79.5775 nH and C = 0.3183 pF. The half-power frequencies,

f1 and f2, are found to be 0.9513 GHz and 1.0513 GHz respectively. As shown in Figure
2.22, the resonant frequency (when the current is maximized) is 1 GHz. Using Equation (2.53)
yields a Q0 of 10.
It is possible to ﬁnd the unloaded quality factor of the circuit directly from the stored energies
of the inductor and capacitor. The magnetic and electric energies are given by
WM = 1
2 LI 2, WE = 1
2 CV 2
C
(2.54)
where VC is the voltage across the capacitor. Writing these and the power delivered to the load
(i.e. the resistor, R) in terms of the current I gives
WM = 1

At resonance, the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic energies are equal and this relation
simpliﬁes to

(2.57)
This formula is often used, but it should be understood that it only applies at resonance. Taking
R = 50 , L = 79.5775 nH and C = 0.3183 pF gives Q0 = 10, as previously.
It is interesting to evaluate the ratio of Q at any frequency to that at resonance. From
Equations (2.56) and (2.57), this is given by
q = Q
Q0

 ω

(2.58)
It can be seen that the unloaded quality factor is a minimum at resonance, although the variation
with frequency is slow. For bandwidths of less than 20%, Q is approximately equal to Q0 with
an error of less than 0.5% – i.e. the term in the parentheses of Equation (2.58) is approximately
equal to two over moderate bandwidths.
We would like to derive a relationship between the unloaded quality factor and the bandwidth
of the circuit. The bandwidth is normally taken to be the range of frequencies over which the
power dissipated; PL is greater than half of the maximum, PL0 (at resonance). However, in the
sections that follow more general relations are derived based on a speciﬁed power transfer to
the load.

as previously seen in Equation (2.53). This derivation does not make any assumptions about
the numerical value of the quality factor or the bandwidth and is, therefore, applicable to both
high- and low-Q systems.
The response of a parallel resonant circuit – shown in Figure 2.23 – can be found in much
the same way as for series resonance.

tively and the power dissipated in the resistance are given by

(2.69)
The ratio between Q and Q0 is the same as for the series resonance, given by Equation (2.58).
It can also be shown (using the same method) that the fractional bandwidth is the same as for
the series resonant circuit.
The formulas for Q that have been derived so far have been for series and parallel resonant
circuits respectively. However, they are often applied – strictly incorrectly – to other circuit
combinations. We will see later that this can give large errors, so some care is required in
applying these formulas.
2.4 Various Transmission Lines
There are many transmission lines developed for various applications. The most popular ones
are shown in Figure 2.24. They are the two-wire transmission line, the coaxial cable, the
microstrip, the stripline, the coplanar waveguide (CPW) and the waveguide. We are going
to examine these transmission lines in terms of their characteristic impedance, basic mode,
frequency bandwidth, loss characteristic and costs.

2.4.1 Two-wire Transmission Line
This is the simplest transmission line and its cross-sectional view is given in Figure 2.25. The
separation of the wires is D and the diameter of the wires is d. The medium between the wires
has a permittivity of ε.
It can be shown that the per unit length inductance and capacitance of the transmission line

The typical value of industrial standard lines is 300 . This type of transmission line was
commonly used to connect a television receiving antenna (usually a folded dipole with an
impedance around 280 ) to a home television set many years ago. The uniform spacing is
assured by embedding the two wires in a low-loss dielectric, usually polyethylene. Since the
wires are embedded in the thin ribbon of polyethylene, the dielectric space is partly air and
partly polyethylene.
2.4.1.2 Fundamental Mode
The electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution around the two-wire transmission line is illustrated
by Figure 1.15. Both the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld are within the transverse (to the
propagation direction) plane, thus this mode is called the TEM (transverse electro magnetic)
mode. This means that it is nondispersive and the velocity is not changed with the frequency.
The plane wave can also be considered a TEM wave.
2.4.1.3 Loss
Since the lumped parameters of a transmission line are given by Equations (2.70) and (2.71),
the attenuation constant α can be calculated using Equation (2.14). However, the principal loss
of the two-wire transmission line is actually due to radiation, especially at higher frequencies.
Thus, this type of transmission line is not suitable for higher frequency applications. The typical
usable frequency is less than 300 MHz.
Some people may be familiar with the twisted-pair transmission line. As the name implies,
the line consists of two insulated wires twisted together to form a ﬂexible line without the
use of spacers. It has relatively good EMC (electromagnetic compatibility) performance –
the twisted conﬁguration cancels out the radiation from both wires and results in a small and
symmetrical total ﬁeld around the line; but it is not suitable for high frequencies because of the
high dielectric losses that occur in the rubber insulation (low costs) as well as the radiation.
When the line is wet, the losses increase signiﬁcantly.
2.4.2 Coaxial Cable
The coaxial cable consists of a central, insulated wire (inner conductor) mounted inside a
tubular outer conductor, as shown in Figure 2.26. In some applications, the inner conductor is
also tubular. The inner conductor is insulated from the outer conductor by insulating materials

The conﬁguration of a coaxial line
which are made of Pyrex, polystyrene, polyethylene plastic or some other material that has
good insulating characteristics and low dielectric losses at high frequencies over a wide range
of temperatures. In order to ensure good EMC performance, shielded and double-shielded
coaxial cables have been developed and are available on the market. This type of transmission
line is widely used for RF engineering and antenna measurements and for the connection
between the antenna and transceiver.
Coaxial cables come in three basic types: ﬂexible, semi-rigid and rigid. The rigid cable gives
the best performance and is normally for high-performance and phase-sensitive applications,
whilst the ﬂexible cables are cheap and, obviously, ﬂexible. The semi-rigid cable is a compro-
mise. As shown in Figure 2.26, the diameters of the inner and outer conductors of a cable are
denoted a and b respectively, and the relative permittivity of the insulating material is εr. The
dielectric material reduces the velocity of the wave inside the cable to c/√εr. Some common
loading materials and corresponding velocities are shown in Table 2.2 [3].

2.4.2.2 Fundamental Mode
The electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution around the coaxial cable is illustrated by Figure 2.27.
Again, both the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld are within the transverse (to the propagation
direction) plane, thus this ﬁeld is TEM mode.
However, this is only true for the frequencies below the cut-off frequency, which is [2]
fc =
v
π(a + b)
(2.75)
where v is the velocity of the wave in the cable and the cut-off wavelength is
λc = π(a + b)
(2.76)
If the operational frequency is above this cut-off frequency (or, say, the operational wavelength
is below the cut-off wavelength), the ﬁeld within the coaxial cable may no longer be TEM
mode; some higher modes such as TE11 (a transverse electric ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld has
nontransverse component) mode may exist, which is not a desirable situation since the loss
could be signiﬁcantly increased.

2.4.2.3 Loss
Since the transmission line lumped parameters are given by Equation (2.73), the attenuation
constant α can be calculated using Equation (2.14) or Equation (2.23) for a low-loss line; that is
α ≈
R
2Z0

√f μεr(1/a + 1/b)
120√πσ2 ln(b/a) + 60πσ1
√εr
(2.77)
which is a function of the coaxial dimensions a and b as well as the conductivity and
permittivity of the materials. When b/a ≈3.592 (which means that the typical characteristic
impedance should be around 77 ohms), the attenuation reaches the minimum. This is one of
the most important considerations when making the cable.
In addition to the characteristic impedance, mode and loss of a cable, there are some other
considerations when choosing a transmission line. Power-handling capacity is one of them,
since it is very important for radar and high-power applications. The breakdown electric ﬁeld
strength in air is about 30 kV/cm (this means the best characteristic impedance should be close
to 30 ohms). A list of some commercial cables with some important speciﬁcations is given in
Table 2.3, where OD stands for the outer diameter and Vmax is the maximum voltage which
may be applied to the cable in Volts. A more complete list can be found in [3]. It is clear that
there are over 100 industry standard cables on the market with various speciﬁcations. The one
with the smallest loss at 400 MHz is RG-211A, about 2.3 dB/100 ft. It is also one of the most
expensive cables – normally the cost is inversely proportional to the loss of the cable.
2.4.3 Microstrip Line
As shown in Figure 2.28, a microstrip line may be viewed as a derivative of a two-wire
transmission line and is perhaps the most widely used form of planar transmission line. One
side of the structure is freely accessible for the mounting of packaged devices and the geometry
lends itself extremely well to PCB patterning techniques to deﬁne the circuit. It has been used
extensively in microwave and millimeter circuits and systems.
Due to the complexity of the structure, the analytical expressions of per unit length param-
eters are difﬁcult to obtain. The effective relative permittivity is approximated as
εre ≈εr + 1
2
+
εr −1
2√1 + 12d/W
(2.78)
This is an empirical expression and is a function of the material property and the ratio W/d. W is
the width of the strip and d is the thickness of the substrate, which has a relative permittivity εr.
2.4.3.1 Characteristic Impedance
The calculation of the characteristic impedance is not an easy task. From the transmission line
theory, the relation between the velocity and per unit length inductance and capacitance is

Thus, to compute the characteristic impedance, we just need to obtain the per unit length

It also decreases monotonically from 126/√εr as W/d increases. That is, the larger the ratio
W/d, the smaller the characteristic impedance; also, the larger the permittivity, the smaller the
characteristic impedance. Practical limitations exist on the range of impedances that can be
manufactured. These limits depend on factors such as the dielectric constant, substrate height
and manufacturing capability. In general, the thinnest line that can be etched routinely with a
good photolithographic process is of the order of 0.1 mm. This then puts the upper bound of the
impedance at 90–120 . The lower bound is determined by the line width, which should not be
comparable to a wavelength. The typical value of the characteristic impedance for industrial
standard lines is 50  or 75 .
2.4.3.2 Fundamental Mode
The electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution around the microstrip line is illustrated by Figure (2.29).
Both the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld are seen to be within the transverse plane. But half
of the wave is traveling in free space, which is faster than the other half wave traveling in the
substrate, thus this ﬁeld is in what is called quasi-TEM mode, a sort of TEM mode.
A result of a microstrip line being an open structure is that circuits are subject to radiation.
This does not mean that they are dangerous to get close to, but the performance of a device or
circuit may be affected. This is a direct consequence of the ‘unterminated’ ﬁeld lines illustrated
in Figure (2.29). In reality, the ﬁeld lines do not just hang in free space but terminate on whatever
is close to the line. The exact relations concerning radiation from a microstrip are complicated
but, in general, narrow lines radiate less.

The ﬁrst higher mode in a microstrip line is the transverse electric TE10 mode, its cut-off
wavelength is twice the strip width. After taking the material and fringing effects into account,
the cut-off frequency can be expressed approximately as
λc ≈√εr(2W + 0.8d)
(2.82)
However, the mode analysis of a microstrip is actually more complicated than this. In addition
to the conventional higher order modes, surface modes may exist. The surface mode does not
need the metal strip; it only needs the ground plane and the substrate. The lowest transverse
electric mode is TE1 and its cut-off frequency is
( fc)T E1 =
3c
√
2
8d√εr −1
(2.83)
The lowest transverse magnetic mode is TM0 and its cut-off frequency is
( fc)T M0 =
c
√
2
4d√εr −1
(2.84)
Obviously ( fc)T E1 = 1.5 · ( fc)T M0 > ( fc)T M0, thus, in order to keep the quasi-TEM mode
propagation, the operational frequency of a microstrip line should be smaller than the cut-off
frequency of the TE10 mode in Equation (2.82) and the cut-off frequency of the TM0 mode in
Equation (2.84). Higher order modes will cause signiﬁcant power loss via conductive loss and
radiation loss. The surface mode may transmit the power to any direction, which is, of course,
not desirable.
2.4.3.3 Loss
The loss of a microstrip line comes from the conductor loss and dielectric substrate loss.
The radiation loss is negligible at low frequencies. For most microstrip lines, conductor loss
is much more signiﬁcant than dielectric loss. The attenuation constant can be calculated
approximately by
αc =

(2.85)
where Rs =

A summary of some of the common substrates is given in Table 2.4. The ﬁrst ﬁve are hard
substrates and the rest are considered soft substrates.
2.4.4 Stripline
A stripline is a conductor sandwiched by a dielectric between a pair of ground planes. It may
be viewed as an evolved structure from a coaxial cable, as shown in Figure 2.30. In practice,
a stripline is usually made by etching circuitry on a substrate that has a ground plane on

There are many advantages of using striplines. Whatever circuits are on a microstrip (which
is a quasi-TEM mode structure), you can do better by using a stripline, unless you run into
fabrication or size constraints. Stripline ﬁlters and couplers always offer better bandwidth than
their counterparts in a microstrip. Another advantage of the stripline is that fantastic isolation
between adjacent traces can be achieved (unlike a microstrip). The best isolation results when a
picket-fence of vias surrounds each transmission line, spaced at less than a quarter-wavelength.
The stripline can be used to route RF signals across each other quite easily when an offset
stripline (i.e. the central conductor is not right at the middle between the two ground planes)
is used.
There are two major disadvantages of a stripline:
1. It is much harder and more expensive to fabricate than the microstrip. Lumped-element and
active components either have to be buried between the ground planes (not as convenient
as a microstrip), or transitions to the microstrip must be employed as necessary to get the
components onto the top of the board.
2. Because of the second ground plane, the strip width is much narrower for given impedance
(such as 50 ohms) and the board is thicker than that for a microstrip. A common reaction to
problems with microstrip circuits is to convert them to a stripline; this may result in a much
larger thickness for the same loss of the transmission line.

The impedance is sensitive to the thickness of the central conductor. The typical value for
industrial standard lines is 50  or 75 .
2.4.4.2 Fundamental Mode
Just as for the ﬁeld within a coaxial cable, the ﬁeld in a stripline is TEM mode. This means
that it is nondispersive and the velocity is not changed with frequency.
It is also possible to generate higher order modes if the operational frequency is above the
lowest cut-off frequency. The smallest wavelength should meet the following condition to avoid
higher order modes:
λmin > 2d√εr
λmin > 2W√εr

2.4.4.3 Loss
The loss characteristics of the stripline are similar to the microstrip but have little loss due to
radiation, as the structure is almost screened.
2.4.5 Coplanar Waveguide (CPW)
The CPW is another popular planar transmission line. Just like a stripline, it may be considered
a structure evolved from a coaxial cable, as shown in Figure 2.31. This structure can also be
viewed as a coplanar stripline. The central conductor is separated from a pair of ground planes.
They all sit on a substrate with a dielectric permittivity of ε. In the ideal case, the thickness
of the dielectric is inﬁnite; in practice, it is just thick enough so that EM ﬁelds die out before
they get out of the substrate. A variant of the coplanar waveguide is formed when a ground
plane is provided on the opposite side of the dielectric; this is called a grounded coplanar
waveguide (GCPW) and was originally developed to counter the power dissipation problems
of CPW.
The CPW offers many advantages, which include the following:
r It is easy to fabricate and to integrate into circuits. Circuit components can be easily mounted
on top of the line (even easier than on a microstrip) due to the fact that both the conductor
and ground plane are on the same side of the substrate. Unlike the microstrip and stripline,
no vias are required.
r It can work to extremely high frequencies (100 GHz or more). Connecting to a CPW does
not entail any parasitic discontinuities in the ground plane.
r Good circuit isolation can be achieved using a CPW, because there are always RF grounds
between traces. Many examples of high-isolation RF switches have used a grounded CPW
to get 60 dB isolation or more.
r The characteristic impedance can be kept as a constant as the signal conductor’s width is
tapered down/up to meet a pin. This is perfect for matching to a component pin width without
changing the substrate thickness.
One disadvantage is potentially lousy heat dissipation - this depends on the thickness of the
line and whether it makes contact with a heat sink. In addition, in terms of the circuit size, the
CPW is at a disadvantage versus a stripline or microstrip circuit; because its effective dielectric
constant is lower (half of the ﬁelds are in air). CPW circuits can be lossier than comparable
microstrip circuits if a compact layout is required.

2.4.5.1 Characteristic Impedance
The design formulas for a CPW are very complicated. There are four geometric parameters: the
gap G, the conductor width W and thickness t and the substrate thickness d. It is not possible to
obtain an accurate analytical expression of the characteristic impedance. Some approximations
have to be made. If the conductor thickness is neglected, the effective permittivity is given
approximately by [2]

where

(2.89)
The effective dielectric constant of a CPW is very close to the average dielectric constant of
the substrate and free space. One way to think about this is that half of the electric ﬁeld lines
are in free space and half are in the dielectric.
The characteristic impedance is

2.4.5.2 Fundamental Mode
The EM ﬁeld distribution around the CPW is illustrated in Figure 2.31 and is similar to that of a
microstrip. The wave velocity in the air is faster than that in the substrate, thus the fundamental
ﬁeld of CPW is quasi-TEM mode.
Higher order modes and surface modes may be generated in a CPW just as in a microstrip
line. Thus, ground straps (bounding wires) are normally needed to tie the two grounds together
in a CPW. These are especially important around any discontinuity, such as a tee junction.
Care has to be taken since the bounding wires themselves could be the cause of discontinuity!
2.4.5.3 Loss
The current on the CPW is concentrated around the signal conductor. The current on the ground
planes is also very focused in a small area, which results in a relatively high conductor loss as
well as a heat dissipation problem. Generally speaking, the CPW exhibits a higher loss than
its microstrip counterpart.
2.4.6 Waveguide
This is a very special and unique electromagnetic transmission line. Unlike any other trans-
mission lines, a waveguide consists of just one piece of metal, which is tubular, usually with
a circular or rectangular cross-section. A rectangular waveguide is shown in Figure 2.32. Due
to the boundary conditions that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds have to satisfy, there are many
possible wave patterns, which are called transverse electric (m, n) modes (TEmn modes) and
transverse magnetic (m, n) modes (TMmn modes). m and n represent the number of peaks along
the x and y axes respectively. For example, TE10 mode means that the electric ﬁeld is within
the transverse plane and there is no electric ﬁeld component along the propagation direction,
whilst the magnetic ﬁeld is not conﬁned to the transverse plane, and the electric ﬁeld changes
along the x-axis, having one peak, but it has no changes along the y-axis. Which modes will
actually be generated inside a waveguide depend on the frequency and excitation.
If the frequency is below the cut-off frequency of the fundamental mode (which is TE10
mode for standard waveguides), no propagation mode can be generated. Thus, the operational
frequency should be greater than the cut-off frequency, which means that the waveguide can be

considered a high-pass ﬁlter. Any signals below the cut-off frequency will be ﬁltered out by the
waveguide. The larger the waveguide, the lower the cut-off frequency. Since large waveguides
are heavy and expensive, they are not attractive for applications. Thus, waveguides are only
used for microwave and millimeter wave frequency bands.
The main advantages of the waveguide are low loss and high power-handling capacities,
which are very important for high-power applications such as radar.
2.4.6.1 Fundamental Mode
The fundamental mode of a standard rectangular waveguide is TE10 mode. The ﬁeld pattern
(along with some higher modes) is illustrated in Figure 2.32 (the ﬁeld patterns for some higher
modes can be found in [2] and [4]). The width and height of the waveguide are a and b
respectively. The electric ﬁeld can be expressed as
Ey = E0 sin( π
a x)e j(ωt−βz)
Ex = Ez = 0
(2.93)
and the magnetic ﬁeld is given by
Hx = H1 sin( π
a x)e j(ωt−βz)
Hy = 0
Hz = H2 cos( π
a x)e j(ωt−βz)
(2.94)
The electric ﬁeld is indeed within the transverse plane and the maximum ﬁeld is at x = a/2,
while the magnetic ﬁeld has two components, one along the propagation direction z. Neither
the electric nor the magnetic ﬁeld is a function of y, i.e. the mode index n = 0.
2.4.6.2 Cut-off Frequency, Waveguide Wavelength and Characteristic Impedance
The cut-off wavelength for TEmn and TMmn modes is given by
λc =
2
	
(m
a )2 + (n
b )2
(2.95)
and its corresponding cut-off frequency is
fc =
1
2√εμ
	
(m
a )2 + (n
b )2
(2.96)
Thus, for TE10 mode, the cut-off wavelength is λc = 2a. This means that the waveguide works
for the operational wavelength λ < 2a.
Since the next highest mode to TE10 is TE20 (for a standard waveguide, 2b < a, i.e. TE01 is
a higher mode than TE20) and its cut-off wavelength is λc = a, this waveguide is only suitable
fortheoperationalwavelengthbetweenthesetwocut-offwavelengths,i.e.a < λ < 2a.Outside

transmission. Higher modes are not desirable since they have higher loss and the ﬁeld pattern

for a certain frequency range. A list of some selected standard waveguides with their suitable
frequency ranges and inside dimensions is given in Table 2.5.
The ﬁeld inside a waveguide exhibits a periodic feature and the period is one waveguide
wavelength, which is actually different from (longer than) the free space wavelength. The
waveguide wavelength can be calculated using
λg = λ

1 −( λ
λc
)2
(2.97)
It is determined by the free space wavelength λ and the cut-off frequency λc.
The characteristic impedance is also mode-dependent. For TE10 mode, it is
ZT E10 = 120π
	
1 −( λ
2a )
(2.98)
which is not a constant but a function of frequency. This is one of the reasons why the single
mode is preferred for waveguide applications.
In this section six of the most popular transmission lines have been introduced and discussed.
The characteristic impedance, fundamental mode and loss characteristics have been presented.
A brief summary is provided in Table 2.6.
2.5 Connectors
In practice, almost all transmission lines have to be terminated to suitable connectors, which
make the device interconnection much easier. There are many types of industrial standard
connectors. Sometimes, more than one connector is available. For example, RG58 cable can
be assembled to SMA, SMB, BNC and Type N connectors. Making the right choice can be a
problem and there is a lack of information on this practical subject in other books, hence we
will address this issue in this section.
Connectors are developed as a pair: a male and a female (an example is shown in
Figure 2.33), although some RF connectors are sexless (such as the APC-7 and the

tion, since the effects of the connector (which is an additional element and may not have been
taken into account in the design) on the system performance and measurements may be quite
signiﬁcant. This is especially true in antenna measurements.
A good summary of all RF/microwave connectors was given by Amphenol RF [5]. Table
2.7 is a selection of some popular connectors for antenna systems and measurements. These
connectors are mainly for coaxial cables, but some of them can be used for other transmission
lines. For example, the SMA straight PCB mount jack, tab terminal panel jack and stub terminal
panel jack are available and widely used in the antenna community.
Since all RF test equipment comes with coaxial connectors (type N and SMA are popular
connectors), direct connection with other forms of transmission lines (such as microstrip and
CPW) would be tricky. Some adapters have been developed. For example, industrial standard
coax-to-waveguide adaptors are now widely available on the market. Figure 2.34 shows how
to connect an SMA connector directly to a microstrip and CPW (feed line to an antenna) in
practice – no standard adaptor is available.

2.6 Summary
This chapter has provided comprehensive coverage of circuit concepts and transmission lines –
this is essential knowledge for antenna feeding, matching and characterization. In summary:
r An introduction to lumped element systems and distributed element systems has been given
right at the beginning. The main idea is that the current, voltage and impedance are all
functions of the frequency and the reference position at the transmission line.
r A transmission line model has been developed to obtain the important parameters of a
transmission line, which include the characteristic impedance, input impedance, attenuation
constant, phase constant and velocity. An extensive study on terminated transmission lines
has been carried out. The reﬂection coefﬁcient, return loss and VSWR have been introduced
to evaluate the line impedance matching.
r The Smith Chart has been introduced as a very useful tool to analyze impedance matching.
Lumped and distributed matching networks and impedance-matching techniques have also
been addressed.
r The bandwidth and quality factor (Q factor) have been discussed in depth.
r Six popular transmission lines have been examined and compared in terms of
their characteristic impedance, fundamental mode, loss characteristics and frequency
bandwidth.
r Various RF/microwave cables and connectors have been presented at the end of this chapter
along with their typical speciﬁcations and frequency bandwidths.

Field Concepts and Radio Waves
In this chapter we will ﬁrst see how Maxwell’s equations can be used to obtain wave solutions.
The concepts of the plane wave, intrinsic impedance and polarization will then be introduced,
followed by a discussion on radio propagation mechanisms and radio wave propagation char-
acteristics in various media. A few basic radio propagation models will be introduced, and
circuit concepts and ﬁeld concepts will be compared at the end of this chapter. The concept of
skin depth will be looked into from both the ﬁeld and circuit points of view. Although the issues
addressed in this chapter may not be used directly for antenna design, the knowledge will be
extremely useful for gaining a better understanding of the antenna radiation characteristics as
well as radio waves – generated/received by antennas. Because antennas and radio propagation
are so closely linked, some countries and universities treat them as a single subject.
3.1 Wave Equation and Solutions
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Maxwell’s modiﬁed version of Ampere’s Circuital Law enables
a set of equations to be combined together to derive the electromagnetic wave equation. The
derivation is relatively straightforward.
Now let us discuss a time-harmonic case with the time factor e jωt, which means a single
frequency and is the most common form of a wave in real life (according to Fourier’s theory,
more complicated cases may be decomposed to a linear combination of harmonic waves).
From Maxwell’s equations (1.29), we have
∇× E = −jωμH
∇× H = (σ + jωε)E
∇• E = ρ/ε
∇• H = 0
(3.1)
Take a curl operation on the ﬁrst equation to yield
∇× ∇× E = ∇(∇• E) −∇2E = −jωμ∇× H

where ∇2 = ∇• ∇= ∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2 + ∂2
∂z2 .
Combine this with the second and third equations in Equation (3.1) to obtain
∇2E −jωμ(σ + jωε)E = ∇(ρ/ε)
(3.2)
Now let
γ =

jωμ(σ + jωε) = α + jβ
(3.3)
where α and β are the attenuation constant and phase constant, respectively. Similar deﬁnitions
were introduced for a transmission line in Chapter 2. From Equation (3.3) we can represent
these constants by the material properties and frequency as:
α = ω√με

ε2ω2 −1
1/2
β = ω√με

1
2

1 + σ 2
ε2ω2 + 1
1/2
(3.4)
Equation (3.2) can now be rewritten as
∇2E −γ 2E = ∇(ρ/ε)
(3.5)
In the source-free region (ρ = 0), we have
∇2E −γ 2E = 0
(3.6)
This is called the wave equation. There are many possible solutions to this equation. Boundary
conditions and sources are required to obtain the speciﬁc solutions. In free space, one of the
solutions is
E = ˆxE0e jωt−γ z = ˆxE0e−αz+ j(ωt−βz)
(3.7)
This can be validated easily by using this representation in the wave equation. Other possible
solutions include, for example
E = ˆxE0e jωt+γ z; E = ˆyE0e jωt+γ z; E = ˆzE0e jωt±γ x; . . .
Using the electric ﬁeld E in Equation (3.7) and Equation (3.1), the magnetic ﬁeld H is
H =
j
ωμ∇× E = −ˆy jγ
ωμ E0e−αz+ j(ωt−βz)

Thus, the magnetic ﬁeld has only a y component in this case, which is orthogonal to the electric
ﬁeld. There is a phase difference between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds if the attenuation
constant is not zero.
3.1.1 Discussion on Wave Solutions
Equation (3.7) can be illustrated by Figure 3.1; it is evident that
r The wave solution is a vector. In this case, it has only an x component.
r Its amplitude is decreased exponentially as a function of the propagation distance (z, in this
case). The attenuation constant α, given by Equation (3.4), is determined by the material
properties and frequency. When the conductivity σ is zero, the wave amplitude is a constant.
r Its phase ϕ is of the form (ωt −βz), which is a function of time, frequency and propagation
distance.
For the loss-free case, σ = 0, Equation (3.4) can be simpliﬁed to
α = 0
β = ω√με
(3.9)
If we ﬁx the phase and let the wave travel a distance of z over a period of time t,
mathematically this is
ϕ = ω · t + β · z = 0
(3.10)
Thus, the velocity of the wave can be obtained as
v = z
t = ω
β
(3.11)
Replace β by Equation (3.9) to give
v =
1
√με
(3.12)

80
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
This means that the wave velocity is determined by the permittivity and permeability of the
medium in which the wave is traveling. In free space this velocity is
v =
1
√μ0ε0
≈3 × 108 m/s
We can therefore conclude that the velocity of an electromagnetic wave (including light) in
free space is about 3 × 108 m/s – this was what Maxwell obtained more than 120 years ago
when he formulated the four equations (more precisely 20 equations in his original work),
but at that time nobody could validate this important result. This is a good example of how
mathematics can be used to solve real world engineering problems.
In addition, from Equation (3.11), we can see that
β = ω
v = 2π f
v
= 2π
λ
(3.13)
Thus, the phase constant is also called the wave number (for every one wavelength, the phase
is changed by 2π), which is the same as what we obtained for a transmission line in Chapter
2. In fact, the transmission line equation (2.7) is just a special case of the wave equation (3.6)
when x and y are ﬁxed. The free space could be viewed as an open transmission line where
the information is carried by electromagnetic (EM) waves.
Light, X-rays and radio waves are EM waves at different frequencies although they seem
to be very different. One thing that all the forms of EM waves have in common is that they
can travel through empty space. This is not true for other kinds of waves; sound waves, for
example, need some kind of material, like air or water, in which to move. EM energy is carried
by photons, the energy of a photon is hf, where h is Planck’s constant = 6.63 × 10−34 Js, and
f is the frequency in Hz.
3.2 The Plane Wave, Intrinsic Impedance and Polarization
3.2.1 The Plane Wave and Intrinsic Impedance
When the conductivity of the medium is zero, the electric ﬁeld in Equation (3.7) can be
simpliﬁed to
E = ˆxE0e j(ωt−βz)
(3.14)
and the corresponding magnetic ﬁeld is
H = ˆy β
ωμ E0e j(ωt−βz) = ˆy
 ε
μ E0e j(ωt−βz)
(3.15)
Thus, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are in phase, of constant amplitude and orthogonal to
each other, as well as being orthogonal to the propagation direction z. This EM wave is called
the plane wave, and is illustrated by Figure 3.2. It is a special but common form of EM wave
whose amplitude is a constant (in theory). The spherical wave is another common wave form.

A plane wave traveling in the z-direction
The plane wave can only exist far away from the source, whilst the spherical wave is considered
closer to the source.
The power ﬂow density of the EM wave, also known as the Poynting vector, is deﬁned as
the cross product of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, i.e.
S = E × H∗(W/m2)
(3.16)
where * denotes the complex conjugate, i.e. (R + j X)∗= R −j X. The Poynting vector de-
scribes the amplitude and direction of the ﬂow of power density in EM waves. It is named
after the English physicist John Henry Poynting, who introduced it in 1884. The power ﬂow
direction is orthogonal to E and H. Equation (3.16) gives the instantaneous Poynting vector.
The averaged Poynting vector is obtained by integrating the instantaneous Poynting vector
over one period and dividing by one period. Thus, the time-averaged power density of an EM
wave is
Sav = 1
2Re(E × H∗) = ˆz 1

 ε

(3.17)
and it can be obtained by its electric ﬁeld amplitude and material properties√ε/μ – this is
actually the ratio of the electric ﬁeld to the magnetic ﬁeld:
η = E

ε = 120π
μr

()
(3.18)
It is called the intrinsic impedance of the material and is determined by the ratio of the
permittivity to the permeability of the medium for a loss-free medium. If the medium is lossy
(conductivity is not negligible and/or the permittivity is complex), the intrinsic impedance is
complex:
η = E
H = −ωμ

and the time-averaged power density is

(3.21)
3.2.2 Polarization
A very important feature of the EM wave is the polarization, which is described by the locus
of the tip of the E vector as time progresses. If we use a trigonometric form (we can also use
the exponential form), a wave propagating towards the z direction can be expressed as
E = ˆxA cos(ωt −βz) + ˆyB sin(ωt −βz)
(3.22)
where A and B, also shown in Figure 3.3, are the amplitudes of the ﬁeld components in the x
and y directions, respectively. It is not difﬁcult to verify that this E ﬁeld is also a solution of
the wave equation (3.6).
If A or B = 0, this expression represents a linearly polarized wave; ifA ̸= B ̸= 0, it is an
elliptically polarized wave; if A = B, it then represents a circularly polarized wave, which is
widely employed in satellite communications. Because the ionosphere causes Faraday rotation
to an EM wave, which means that a linearly polarized EM wave may be rotated by an unknown
amount (depending on the thickness and temperature of the ionosphere, as well as the frequency
– the rotation is high at lower frequencies but small at higher frequencies), making the linearly
polarized wave hard to match after passing through the ionosphere. However, there is no prob-
lem for circularly polarized waves; this is why satellite systems like GPS (global positioning
system) have employed circular polarization, not linear polarization, for transmission.
The circularly polarized wave may be considered a combination of two linearly polarized
waves. There are two types of circular polarization: right-hand circular polarization (RCP)

and left-hand circular polarization (LCP) – one linearly polarized wave is ahead of or behind
the other one by 90 degrees. When the thumb points to the propagation direction, if the tip
of the E vector follows the right-hand ﬁngers as time progresses, it is RCP. Otherwise, it
is LCP. Equation (3.22) represents a right-hand circularly polarized wave if A = B > 0. Its
corresponding left-hand polarized wave can be expressed as
E = ˆxA cos(ωt −βz) −ˆyB sin(ωt −βz)
(3.23)
There is just a sign change: ‘+’ is changed to ‘−’ for the y component. The ratio of amplitudes
A to B is called the axial ratio:
AR = A
B
(3.24)
For a circularly polarized wave, AR is one. For a linearly polarized wave, it is inﬁnite or zero,
thus 0 ≤AR ≤+∞.
It should be pointed out that a plane wave can be linearly polarized, circularly polarized
or elliptically polarized. Equation (3.14) represents a linearly polarized plane wave, whilst
Equations (3.22) and (3.23) are circularly polarized plane waves.
3.3 Radio Wave Propagation Mechanisms
Radio wave propagation is a special subject. A radio wave is considered a general term in
this book for EM waves up to about 100 GHz. In this section we are going to brieﬂy review
wave propagation mechanisms, which include wave reﬂection, transmission, diffraction and
scattering.
3.3.1 Reﬂection and Transmission
As we understand now, an EM wave far away from its source may be considered a local plane
wave. Let a linearly polarized plane wave be incident on the surface between Medium 1 and
Medium 2, as shown in Figure 3.4. What is going to happen at the boundary? The wave will be
partially reﬂected back to Medium 1 and partially transmitted (more precisely refracted; the
refraction is the change in direction of a wave due to a change in velocity from one medium to
another) into Medium 2. If the loss can be neglected, there are a few important points to note:
r the incident angle θi is the same as the reﬂected angle θr, that is θi = θr;
r the incident angle θi is linked to the transmitted angle θt by Snell’s law:

and the transmission coefﬁcient is deﬁned as the ratio of the transmitted wave to the incident
wave, i.e.
T = Et
Ei
(3.27)
Both coefﬁcients are linked to the wave polarization. There are basically two orthogonal
polarizations – parallel polarization (E is parallel to the incident plane formed by the incident
and reﬂected waves) and perpendicular polarization (E is perpendicular to the incident plane),
as shown in Figure 3.5. Any other polarizations can be considered to be combinations of these
two principal polarizations.
We can employ either the ﬁeld approach or the circuit approach to obtain the reﬂection and
transmission coefﬁcients. Using ﬁeld concepts, we need to employ the boundary conditions,
which is relatively complicated. Thus, we are going to use the circuit approach to obtain these
coefﬁcients.
From Figure 3.4, we can see that the two media can be replaced by two analogous transmis-
sion lines with characteristic impedances of Z1 and Z2, respectively. They are determined by

η1/ cos θi; for perpendicular pol.
Z2 =
	
η2 · cos θt; for parallel pol.
η2/ cos θt; for perpendicular pol.
(3.28)
where the intrinsic impedance η is determined by material properties, as shown in Equation
(3.19). The reﬂection coefﬁcient between these two transmission lines can be obtained easily
from Equation (2.28), i.e.:
 = Z2 −Z1
Z2 + Z1
(3.29)
which is also the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the boundary between Medium 1 and Medium 2. The
transmission coefﬁcient is
T = 1 +  =
2Z2
Z2 + Z1
(3.30)
The reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients are ratios of electric ﬁeld strengths. Because the
incident power equals the sum of the reﬂected and transmitted powers, we have:
||2 + |T |2 = 1
(3.31)
Example 3.1: Reﬂection on a perfect conductor. Obtain the reﬂection and transmission co-
efﬁcients between air and a perfect conductor.
Solution:
The conductivity of a perfect conductor is inﬁnite. Using Equations (3.19) and (3.28), we know
that the characteristic impedance of its equivalent transmission line is zero for any polarization
and incident angle, i.e. Z2 = 0, thus
 = −1 and T = 0
This means that all signals are reﬂected back and the phase is changed by 180 degrees. There
is no signal transmitted into the conductor.
Example 3.2: Reﬂection on a ground. If the relative permittivity of a ground is 9 and the
conductivity is very small and negligible, plot the reﬂection coefﬁcient as a function of the
incident angle for both parallel and perpendicular polarizations.

86
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Solution:
ε1 = 1 and ε2 = 9. To obtain the reﬂection coefﬁcient, we ﬁrst use Equation (3.25) to yield
sin θt
sin θi

3, thus cos θt =

and then use Equation (3.28) to give
Z1 =

Z2 =

40π ·

1 −sin2 θi/9; for parallel pol.
40π/

1 −sin2 θi/9; for perpendicular pol.
Thus, the reﬂection coefﬁcient for parallel polarization is
// = Z2 −Z1
Z2 + Z1
=

1 −sin2 θi/9 −3 cos θi

1 −sin2 θi/9 + 3 cos θi
and the reﬂection coefﬁcient for perpendicular polarization is
⊥= Z2 −Z1
Z2 + Z1
= cos θi −3

1 −sin2 θi/9
cos θi + 3

1 −sin2 θi/9
The results are plotted as a function of the incident angle in Figure 3.6. Obviously, the re-
ﬂection coefﬁcients are very different for different polarizations. There are some important
observations:

r For parallel polarization, the reﬂection coefﬁcient vanishes (= 0) at a particular incident
angle, this angle is called Brewster’s angle:
θB = sin−1

εr
εr + 1
(3.32)
r For perpendicular polarization, the larger the incident angle, the larger the reﬂection coefﬁ-
cient (magnitude).
r At normal incidence, the reﬂection coefﬁcient is the same for both polarizations.
r At 90 degrees, the reﬂection coefﬁcient is 1 for parallel polarization and −1 for perpendicular
polarization.
Special Case 1: when the incident angle is greater than Brewster’s angle for parallel
polarization,  > 0, as shown in Figure 3.6. Can we still employ Equation (3.30) to calculate
the transmission coefﬁcient?
The answer is no, otherwise |T | would be greater than one and would fail to meet the
condition set by Equation (3.31). Thus, Equation (3.30) is only valid for Re() < 0. If Re() >
0, Equation (3.30) should be replaced by
T = 1 − =
2Z1
Z2 + Z1
(3.33)
Special Case 2: when the incident wave travels from a dense medium into a less dense
medium at an angle exceeding the critical angle, what will happen?
The critical angle is the incident angle that gives a transmitted angle of 90 degrees when
the wave is from a dense medium to a less dense medium, such as from water into air. From
Snell’s law, let sin θt = 1 to obtain this special angle
θic = sin−1
√ε2μ2
√ε1μ1
(3.34)
If the relative permittivity of the water is 80, the critical angle is 6.42 degrees.
When the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, for whatever polarization, the
wave will be totally internally reﬂected and will also be accompanied by a surface wave in
the less dense medium. This surface wave decays exponentially away from the surface but
propagates without loss along the surface [1]. People have developed communication systems
for submarines utilizing this phenomenon.
3.3.1.1 Effects of Reﬂection and Transmission on Wave Polarization
Example 3.2 has clearly shown that, for non-normal incidence, the reﬂection coefﬁcients are
different for the two principal polarizations. As a result, if an incident wave is a combination
of these two orthogonal waves, the combined signal after the reﬂection will be changed. For
example, if the incidentwaveisacircularpolarization,whichmeansthattheparallelcomponent
and the perpendicular component are of the same amplitudes but 90 degrees out of phase, after
the reﬂection, the wave is no longer a circularly polarized wave but an elliptically polarized

wave – because the wave components in these two orthogonal planes are no longer the same.
Similarly, if it is a linearly polarized wave, after the reﬂection, this linear polarization may be
rotated.
The same conclusion can be drawn for the transmitted wave, since the transmission coef-
ﬁcients are also different for the two different polarizations if the incident angle is not zero
degrees (normal incidence).
An important special case is when the reﬂector is a perfect conductor; here the reﬂection
coefﬁcient is −1. For a linearly polarized wave, this means a phase change of 180 degrees.
But for a circularly polarized wave, an RCP wave becomes an LCP wave, and an LCP wave
becomes an RCP after the reﬂection. This results in polarization mismatch. Thus, circular
polarization is not recommended for indoor radio communications where plenty of reﬂections
occur for a radio path.
3.3.1.2 Radio Waves through a Wall
A very common scenario is a radio wave passing through a wall to reach a television, mobile
phone or other radio device (such as a laptop computer). How can we ﬁnd out the transmission
coefﬁcient and the attenuation?
Again, we can use circuit concepts to deal with this problem, which should be much simpler
than using ﬁeld concepts. As shown in Figure 3.7, there are now three media. Their equiva-
lent transmission lines have the characteristic impedances Z1, Z2 and Z3, respectively. They
are deﬁned by Equation (3.28). The thickness of the wall is d. There are multiple reﬂections
and transmissions at the boundaries. Thus, the reﬂected wave is now the summation of all
the reﬂected waves, and the transmitted wave is also the summation of all the waves trans-
mitted. They could be combined constructively (larger) or destructively (smaller). Using the
transmission line model, the calculation of the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients is much
easier than the ﬁeld approach (but it is still not easy!). Z3 may be considered the load of the
second transmission line. Using Equation (2.32), the input impedance at the interface between

Medium 1 and Medium 2 can be written as
Zin = Z2
Z3 + Z2 tanh(γ2de)
Z2 + Z3 tanh(γ2de)
(3.35)
where γ2 = √jωμ2(σ2 + jωε2) and de = d/cos θt is the effective thickness. If the loss is
negligible, we have
Zin = Z2
Z3 + j Z2 tan(β2de)
Z2 + j Z3 tan(β2de)
(3.36)
Thus, the reﬂection coefﬁcient is:
 = Zin −Z1
Zin + Z1
From a power point of view, the power transmitted through the wall is
PT = (Pin −PR) · A
(3.37)
where
PT = power transmitted through the wall;
Pin = incident power;
PR = reﬂected power = Pin · ||2
A = attenuation of the wall = e−2αde, i.e. it is determined by the attenuation constant and
the effective thickness of the wall.
Example 3.3: Reﬂection of a wall. A brick wall has a relative permittivity of 4 and a thickness
of 20 cm, the loss is negligible.
a. If the operational frequency is 2.45 GHz for wireless applications (such as Bluetooth),
plot the reﬂection coefﬁcient as a function of the incident angle for both parallel and
perpendicular polarizations.
b. Iftheincidentangleis45degrees,plotthereﬂectioncoefﬁcientasafunctionofthefrequency

length λ2 = λ0/

b. When the frequency is set as the variable, the reﬂection coefﬁcients for both polarizations
are as plotted in Figure 3.9. We can see that:
r The reﬂection coefﬁcients are periodic functions of the frequency. The period for both
polarizations is the same, 350 MHz in this particular case (for the normal incident, the
periodis375MHz),i.e.itswavelengthishalfoftheeffectivethickness.Thus,thereﬂection
coefﬁcient is minimized when the thickness of the wall is an integer of half of the effective
wavelength. This important conclusion can be used for antenna radome and housing
design.
r The reﬂection reaches the maximum when de = λ/4 + nλ/2, n = 0, 1, 2 . . .
r The reﬂection coefﬁcients are very small for low frequencies. This is why low-frequency
signals can easily penetrate buildings.
r Again, the reﬂection coefﬁcient of perpendicular polarization is always greater than (or
the same as) that of parallel polarization.
In this example, since the conductivity is zero, the waves which are not reﬂected by the
wall will pass through the wall without attenuation and the transmission coefﬁcient can be
calculated using the reﬂection–transmission equation (3.31).
It is clear now that radio wave reﬂection and transmission are complicated. The coefﬁcients
are functions of frequency, incident angle and polarization, as well as the dielectric properties
of the media.
3.3.2 Diffraction and Huygens’s Principle
Diffraction is the apparent bending and spreading of waves when they meet an obstacle. It can
occur with any type of wave, including sound waves, water waves and electromagnetic waves.
As a simple example of diffraction, if you speak into one end of a cardboard tube, the sound

waves emerging from the other end spread out in all directions, rather than propagating in a
straight line like a stream of water from a garden hose.
The foundation of diffraction theory is based on Huygens’s Principle, which states that each
point on a primary wave front can be considered a new source of a secondary spherical wave,
as suggested in Figure 3.10. The new source is considered an equivalent source, which can be
expressed mathematically as
JS = ˆn × H
MS = −ˆn × E
(3.38)
where JS and MS are the equivalent surface electric current and magnetic current on an imag-
inary surface S, respectively; ˆn is the unit vector, normal to the surface S. Thus, the original
problem can be replaced by an equivalent source which produces the same electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds outside the (enclosed) surface S. Thus, Huygens’s principle is closely linked to
Love’s equivalence principle, which was developed by replacing an actual radiating source
by an equivalent source. This principle is very useful for analyzing aperture-type and slot
antennas, which will be discussed in Chapter 5.
When the distance from the obstacle to the receiver (Rx) is much larger than the height of
the obstacle, which could be a mountain or a building, the relative (to the direct ray) power
density S can be approximated by [1]
S =
λ
4π2h2 ( r1r2
r1 + r2
)
(3.39)
where λ is the wavelength.r1 andr2 are the distances to the transmitter and receiver, respectively
and h is the height of the obstacle above the reference line.
Thus, diffraction by obstacles is an important mechanism for radio propagation, espe-
cially when there is no line-of-sight path available. Radio broadcasting signals can pass over
hills/mountains and mobile radio signals can reach to the street; these are just some of the ex-
amples beneﬁtting from radio wave diffraction. Radar is able to detect various targets, which
is also partially due to diffraction of the radar signal from the target.
3.3.3 Scattering
Unlike the other propagation mechanisms where the size of the medium or the obstacle is much
larger than the wavelength, scattering occurs when the obstacle is comparable to or even smaller

dielectric properties diffuse a portion of the incident wave in all directions. In scattering, there
are no energy transformation results, only a change in the spatial distribution of the radiation,
as shown in Figure 3.11. Back scattering has been employed for radar applications, such as
target detection and weather forecasting.
Along with absorption, scattering is a major cause of the attenuation of radio propagation by
theatmosphere.Scatteringvariesasafunctionoftheratiooftheparticle/obstaclediametertothe
wavelengthofthewave.Whenthisratioislessthanaboutone-tenth,Rayleighscatteringoccurs,
in which the scattering coefﬁcient varies inversely as the fourth power of the wavelength – this
result can be used to explain why the sky is red at sunrise and sunset but blue at midday (the
wavelength of red light is long and the wavelength of blue light is short, thus most transmitted
light is red but most scattered light is blue). At larger values of the ratio of the particle diameter
to the wavelength, the scattering varies in a complex fashion described by the Mie theory; at a
ratio of the order of 10, the laws of geometric optics (where the wave can be treated as a ray)
begin to apply.
3.4 Radio Wave Propagation Characteristics in Media
Radio waves propagating through a radio channel may undergo reﬂection, transmission or
refraction, diffraction and scattering. Attenuation or absorption is another important aspect
that we have not yet discussed properly. The same radio wave propagating through different
media may exhibit very different features. In this section we are going to brieﬂy examine radio
wave propagation characteristics in some common media.
3.4.1 Media Classiﬁcation and Attenuation
From an electromagnetics point of view, materials can be classiﬁed as conductive, semi-
conductive or dielectric media. The electromagnetic properties of materials are normally func-
tions of the frequency, so are the propagation characteristics. Recall that, in Chapter 1, we
introduced the complex permittivity and deﬁned the loss tangent as the ratio of the imaginary
to the real parts of the permittivity, which is Equation (1.36):
tan δ = ε′′
ε′ = σ

Fleisch, Electromagnetics with Application, 5th edition, McGraw-Hill, 1999. Reproduced by permission

This has taken the frequency as well as the normal permittivity and conductivity of the medium
into account. The speciﬁc classiﬁcations are given in [1] as
r Conductor:
tan δ = σ
ωε > 100
r Semi-conductor:
0.01 < tan δ = σ
ωε < 100
r Dielectric:
tan δ = σ
ωε < 0.01
The classiﬁcation of some common media as a function of frequency is shown in Figure
3.12, where M is determined by tan δ = 10M. It is important to note that:
r The medium classiﬁcation is indeed frequency dependent.
r Most materials are in the conducting region at low frequencies (< 10 kHz) but in the
dielectric region at high frequencies (> 1 GHz). The ground and water are just two
examples.
r Figure 3.12 is just an approximation to illustrate material properties over a wide frequency
range. Real-world materials are more complicated. A typical complex dielectric permittivity
spectrum is shown in Figure 3.13. A Cole–Cole model or Debye relaxation model is often
used to approximate this frequency response. The permittivity ε and conductivity σ are not
constant but functions of frequency as well.
This classiﬁcation is useful for evaluating the EM properties of a medium in terms of the
loss tangent but is not accurate for classifying whether a medium is lossy or not. Recall that

The loss tangent is just a term in the bracket. The attenuation constant is actually proportional
to the frequency if the loss tangent is ﬁxed. Generally speaking, the dominant feature of radio
wave propagation in media is that the attenuation increases with the frequency – this seems to
contradict the material classiﬁcation. Figure 3.12 is not a good reference for propagation loss
characteristics, but a useful plot of the loss tangent against the frequency.
It is now clear that many common media may be considered to be conducting materials at
low frequencies and dielectric materials at high frequencies, but their attenuation increases with
frequency. This is why, generally speaking, low frequencies have been used for longer distance
communications and high frequencies are employed for shorter distance communications.
3.4.1.1 Propagation through the Ionosphere
It is important to take into account the propagation characteristics of the ionosphere when
long-distance and satellite-type communications are considered. The ionosphere is the region
above the troposphere (where the air is), from about 80 to 400 km above the Earth. It is a
collection of ions, which are atoms that have some of their electrons stripped off, leaving two
or more electrically charged objects. The sun’s rays cause the ions to form, and these then
slowly recombine.
The propagation of radio waves in the presence of ions is drastically different from that in
air, which is why the ionosphere plays an important role in most modes of propagation. The
major effects of the ionosphere on radio waves are:
r Reﬂection at low frequencies (up to about 30 MHz). Thus, the ionosphere and the Earth can
form a kind of waveguide, letting a wave propagate over a very long distance using ground/
surface mode.

96
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
r Scattering, refraction and absorption when high-frequency waves (above 100 MHz) pass
through it.
r Faraday rotation: the wave polarization plane/line is rotated through the ionosphere. The
amount of rotation is dependent on the thickness and charge density of the ionosphere, which
are functions of time (and where the sun is), and is also dependent on the frequency. The
rotation is small at very high frequencies (> 10 GHz), which is why linear polarizations may
be employed for satellite communications or broadcasting if the frequency is high enough.
3.4.1.2 Propagation in Rain
Rain is an undesired medium of a radio channel. It causes a considerable number of problems
every year for radio communications and radar systems. The major effect of rain on radio
waves is attenuation due to absorption and scattering over a wide range of the spectrum. The
attenuation depends on a number of things and it can be represented by [2]
A = aRb, dB/km
(3.41)
where R is the rainfall rate in mm/h, and a and b are constants that depend on frequency
and temperature of the rain. The temperature dependence is due to the variation of dielectric
permittivity of water with temperature.
A light drizzle corresponds to a rainfall rate of 0.25 mm/h, light rain to 1 mm/h, moderate
rain to 4 mm/h, heavy rain to 16 mm/h and cloud bursts up to many cm/h. Figure 3.14 is an
illustration of how the attenuation is linked to the rainfall rate and frequency [2].
The ﬁgure shows clearly that the attenuation around 10 GHz is much smaller than 30
and 100 GHz. At a rainfall rate of 10 mm/h, the attenuation is increased from 0.2 dB/km at
10 GHz to about 2 dB/km at 30 GHz (ten times more). If we take the sky noise temperature
into account, a low-noise and low-loss radio ‘window’ exists between 1 and about 15 GHz –
this is why most satellite communication systems operate within this frequency band.

3.4.1.3 Propagation in Snow
Some parts of the world have no snow at all, but other parts have to face the problem most of
the time. The attenuation in dry snow is an order of magnitude less than that in rain for the
same precipitation rate. But attenuation by wet snow is comparable to that in rain and may
even exceed that of rain at millimeter wavelengths. It is difﬁcult to specify the attenuation in
any simple form.
3.4.1.4 Propagation through Fog
Fog is another unfriendly medium we have to deal with. The attenuation equation is the same
as that for rain but with much smaller attenuation.
3.5 Radio Wave Propagation Models
For radio communication system designers, it is important to be able to predict the radio wave
propagation pathloss, which is deﬁned as the difference between the power transmitted and
the power received at the destination. Using the pathloss information, the designer is able to
optimize the system and ensure sufﬁcient radio coverage. That is, to establish the link budget
and ﬁgure out where to place the antenna and what the required transmitted power is to cover
the desired area. Since this is a very important subject, it has been studied comprehensively by
many researchers over the years and some propagation models have been developed for various
scenarios. Here we are going to discuss some basic propagation models closely linked to
antennas.
3.5.1 Free Space Model
If there is just one ray between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna (the line-of-
sight case), such as in satellite/space communications, as shown in Figure 3.15, the received
power can be obtained using the well-known Friis transmission formula, which will be dis-
cussed in Chapter 4, that is
Pr = Pt
 λ
4πr
2
GtGr
(3.42)
where Pr is the received power, Pt is the transmitted power, Gt and Gr are the gains of the
transmitting and receiving antennas, respectively and r is the distance between the transmitting
and receiving antennas. Without considering the antenna performance (let Gt = Gr = 1), the
pathloss L P can be found from Equation (3.42) as
L P = 10 log10
 Pt
Pr

= 20 log 10 f + 20 log 10r −147.6 (dB)
(3.43)
where f is the frequency. This means that the pathloss is proportional to the frequency squared
and the distance squared. The larger the distance, the larger the pathloss; the higher the fre-
quency, the larger the pathloss. For a ﬁxed distance or frequency, the pathloss is 20 dB/decade.

Free space communications
3.5.2 Two-ray Model/Plane Earth Model
As shown in Figure 3.16, the two-ray model can be applied to many terrestrial communications
scenarios, such as radio broadcasting and radio communications in rural environments. The
transmitted signals reach the destination via the line-of-sight path and the path reﬂected by the
ground. The result becomes complicated because the signals may be combined constructively
or destructively, depending on the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the ground and the phase difference
of these two rays.
The path difference between these two rays is (using the image theory to be discussed in the
next chapter and assuming d ≫h1 + h2)
r =

(h1 −h2)2 + d2 ≈2h1h2

When this difference is half of the wavelength, the phase difference is 180 degrees (out of
phase), the separation is
d f = 4h1h2
λ
(3.44)
and is called the ﬁrst Fresnel zone distance. It is useful to note the following results:
r when the separation of the two antennas is smaller than this distance, d < d f , the pathloss
is about 20 dB/decade;
r when the separation is greater than this distance, d > d f , the pathloss is 40 dB/decade,
because it can be shown [3] that, in this case, the received power
Pr = Pt

(3.45)
Hence, the pathloss expressed in dB is
L P = −10 log10
h1h2

2
= 40 log10(d) −20 log10(h1h2), dB
(3.46)
It is apparent that the higher the base-station antenna and the mobile antenna, the smaller the
pathloss. Thus, there is little wonder that all mobile operators want to erect their antennas as
high as possible!
3.5.3 Multipath Models
For the multipath case (more than two rays), no analytical equations have been obtained to
give an accurate prediction of the radio propagation pathloss. But empirical and statistical
representations are available for various scenarios.
Most of the popular outdoor pathloss prediction tools are based on Okumura and Hata’s
formulation, which was based on a huge amount of measured data for frequencies between
100 MHz and 3 GHz [3].
For indoor scenarios, many researchers have shown that indoor pathloss actually obeys the
distance power law as
L P(d) = L P(d0) + 10n log
 d
d0

+ X, dB
(3.47)
where d0 is the reference distance (normally it is 1 m), the power index n depends on the
frequency, surroundings and building type and X represents a normal random variable in dB
having a standard deviation of σ dB. Typical values for various buildings are provided in
Table 3.1. It is apparent that the value n is normally (but not always) larger than 2, which
is the free space case. It also shows that the higher the frequency, the larger n for the same
scenario.

For a multipath environment, in addition to the pathloss, there are many other important
characteristics, which include the following:
r Multipath fast fading: the received signal changes signiﬁcantly (> 30 dB) over a very
short distance (few wavelengths), resulting from the complex and vector summation of
signals.
r Delay spread: multiple copies of the original signal arrive at the destination at different times
through different paths, which may cause dispersion and inter-symbol interference, ISI, (the
equalizer is a device developed to remove all delayed waves and combat the ISI problem).
The RMS (root-mean-square) delay spread TRMS (in seconds) is used to characterize this
feature. The delay spread is often employed to deﬁne the channel’s coherence bandwidth
BC (similar to a ﬁlter’s bandwidth – a radio channel can be considered a ﬁlter in a certain
sense). They are linked by the following equation:
BC =
1
2πTRMS
, (Hz)
(3.48)
If the channel bandwidth is greater than the message bandwidth, all the frequency compo-
nents in the message will arrive at the receiver with little or no distortion and the ISI can be
negligible. The channel is described as ﬂat fading.
If the channel bandwidth is smaller than the message bandwidth, all the frequency compo-
nents in the message will arrive at the receiver with distortion and ISI. In this case the channel
is described as frequency selective fading.
Statistically, the power density function (PDF) of the received (short-term) signal envelope
follows a certain distribution, depending on the speciﬁc propagation channel. According to the
PDF distribution function, the channel can be classiﬁed as one of the following:
r whenthereisaline-of-sightray,itfollowsaGaussiandistributionandthischannelistherefore
called the Gaussian channel;

Field Concepts and Radio Waves
101
r When there is a partial line-of-sight ray (the path is partially blocked by obstacles such as
trees), it follows a Rician distribution and this channel is therefore called the Rician channel;
r when there is no line-of-sight ray, it follows a Rayleigh distribution and this channel is
therefore called the Rayleigh channel.
For the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a communication system can obtain the best bit error
rate (BER) from a Gaussian channel and the worst BER from a Rayleigh channel.
Antenna diversity techniques and MIMO antennas, which will be discussed later, were
developed speciﬁcally for multipath environments.
3.6 Comparison of Circuit Concepts and Field Concepts
We have now introduced both circuit concepts and ﬁeld concepts, which may seem to be
completely different. However, if we compare these two sets of parameters, some interesting
correspondence can be obtained. For example, the product of the voltage and current is power
in circuit concepts, whilst the cross product of the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld is the power
density in ﬁeld concepts; the ratio of the voltage to the current is the impedance, whilst the ratio
of the electric ﬁeld to the magnetic ﬁeld is the intrinsic impedance. Let’s take another look at
how the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld are distributed around a two-wire transmission line,
as shown in Figure 3.17. It is not difﬁcult to conclude that the fundamental correspondences

3.6.1.1 Skin Depth – Field Concepts
From the ﬁeld concept point of view, a radio wave traveling into a lossy medium can be
described by Equation (3.7). That is
E = ˆxE0e−αz+ j(ωt−βz)
The skin depth is deﬁned as the distance δ through which the amplitude of a traveling plane
wave decreases by factor 1/e and is therefore
δ = 1

This means that
r the higher the frequency, the smaller the skin depth;
r the larger the permeability, the smaller the skin depth;
r the larger the conductivity, the smaller the skin depth.
For a good conductor, the permittivity has little effect on the skin depth.
It should be highlighted that the wave amplitude is reduced by a factor of 1/e, or 37%, or
8.686 dB over one skin depth.

3.6.1.2 Skin Depth – Circuit Concepts
From the circuit concept point of view, the current density J in an inﬁnitely thick plane
conductor decreases exponentially with depth from the surface as follows:
J = J0e−z/δ
where δ is a constant called the skin depth. This is deﬁned as the depth below the surface of
the conductor at which the current density decays to 1/e (about 37%) of the current density at
the surface. Mathematically it is the same as Equation (3.50). As a result, when calculating the
per-unit-length resistance of a conducting wire,
R = 1
Sσ
where S is now the effective area rather than the whole cross-section of the wire when the wire
radius r > δ. In Figure 3.18, this effective area can be approximated as S = πr2 −π(r −δ)2 ≈
2πrδ (not S = πr2). Thus, the per-unit-length resistance is now
R ≈
1
2πrδσ =
√f μ
2r√πσ
(3.51)
It has become apparent that the skin effect causes the effective resistance of the conductor
to increase with the frequency of the current. To illustrate the effects of skin depth, the skin
depth and resistance of a 3 cm gold rectangular track of a device (as part of a microstrip line
or CPW) are given in Table 3.3 (conductivity σ = 4.1 × 107 S/m). The width and thickness of

the track are 16 μm and 7 μm, respectively. The skin depth is small and the resistance changes
signiﬁcantly with the frequency.
The effects of skin depth are not just limited to the resistance; it may cause other problems
such as overheating in certain areas of the circuit or antenna, which should also be taken into
account in system design.
3.7 Summary
In this chapter we have obtained the wave solutions and introduced a set of concepts and pa-
rameters for ﬁeld analysis, which include the plane wave, polarization and intrinsic impedance.
Careful examinations of radio wave reﬂection, transmission, diffraction and scattering have
been undertaken, and the focus has been on the analysis of radio reﬂection and transmission,
the two most common propagation mechanisms. Radio propagation models for various sce-
narios and channel characteristics have been introduced and discussed. A comparison of ﬁeld
concepts and circuit concepts has revealed the interesting correspondence between these two
sets of concepts.

Antenna Basics
We have introduced circuit concepts and ﬁeld concepts and studied transmission lines and
radio waves in previous chapters. In this chapter we are going to study antenna theory, see
how antennas are linked to radio waves and transmission lines and introduce the essential and
important parameters of an antenna from both the circuit point of view and the ﬁeld point of
view. It is hoped that, through this chapter, you will become familiar with the antenna language
and gain a better understanding of antennas. At the end, you will know how they work and
what the design parameters and considerations are.
4.1 Antennas to Radio Waves
In Chapter 2 we introduced Maxwell’s equations, which reveal the fundamental relations
between the electric ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬁeld and the sources. Again, we only discuss a single-
frequency source case (an arbitrary case can be considered to be the combination of many
single-frequency sources), thus Maxwell’s equations can be written as
∇× E = −jωμH
∇× H = J + jωεE
(4.1)
∇• E = ρ/ε
∇• H = 0
Using a similar process to that used to derive Equation (3.2), we can obtain
∇2E + ω2μεE = jωμJ + ∇(ρ/ε)
(4.2)
This is an equation which links the radiated electric ﬁeld (no magnetic ﬁeld) directly to the
source. To solve this equation, boundary conditions are required. For an open boundary, which
means that the ﬁeld vanishes when the distance from the source V to the ﬁeld point be-
comes inﬁnite, as shown in Figure 4.1, the solution of Equation (4.2) in a uniformed medium

where r is the distance vector from the origin to the observation point and r′ is from the origin
to the source point. This equation gives the radiated electric ﬁeld from a time-varying current
J (the time factor e jωt is omitted here) and is the very foundation of antenna theory – it reveals
how the antenna is related to radio waves. Only a time-varying current (vibrating charges as
shown in Figure 4.1) can generate a radio wave – not a DC current or static charges. Antenna
design is all about how to control the current distribution J and hence to obtain the desired
radiated ﬁeld E. Antenna theory may be summarized by this single but complex equation,
which includes vector partial differentiation and integration. It is normally not possible to
yield an analytical expression of the radiated ﬁeld.
4.1.1 Near Field and Far Field
However, the analytical solution is obtainable for some very simple cases. For example, when
the source is an ideal current element with length l and current value I, the current density
vector can be expressed as
J = ˆzIl
This current is electrically short (i.e.l ≪λ) and ﬁctitious, but very useful for antenna analysis.
Replacing J with this representation in Equation (4.3), the radiated electric ﬁeld can be found as

where η is the intrinsic impedance of the medium. We can use this and the ﬁrst equation in

Hφ = Il

It is apparent that, for this simple case, the electric ﬁeld has Eθ and Er components, whilst
the magnetic ﬁeld has just an Hφ component. The other ﬁeld components are zero.
When the angle θ is 90 degrees, the magnetic ﬁeld reaches the maximum. The electric ﬁeld,
magnetic ﬁeld and their ratio are shown in Figure 4.2 as a function of βr for a given frequency.
It is interesting to note that
r the electric ﬁeld is always greater than the magnetic ﬁeld;
r when βr >1, the ratio of |E/H| = η is about 377  in free space;
r when βr <1, as the distance increases, the electric ﬁeld reduces at a much faster rate
(60 dB/decade) than the magnetic ﬁeld (40 dB/decade).
When the distance is ﬁxed, the electric ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld and their ratio are shown in
Figure 4.3 as a function of β (which is proportional to the frequency). It is evident that
r βr = 1 is still an important point.
r The electric ﬁeld ﬁrst reduces as β (or frequency) increases to the point βr = 1 and then
changes to increase with β (or frequency) after this point.
r The magnetic ﬁeld is a constant before the point βr = 1 and then increases with β (or
frequency) at the same rate as the electric ﬁeld when βr > 1.
r The ratio of E/H reduces (at the same rate as the electric ﬁeld) ﬁrst as β increases to about
βr = 1; it then becomes a constant for βr > 1.

The ﬁelds are now simpler. It is important to note the following points:
r there is now just one electric ﬁeld component and one magnetic ﬁeld component;
r both ﬁelds are inversely proportional to the distance r;
r the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld are orthogonal to each other and the cross product of these
two is the power density function, which is inversely proportional to the distance squared r2:

r the ratio of E/H is η, the intrinsic impedance, which is the same as that of the plane wave in
Chapter 2;
r the ﬁelds are proportional to sin θ. They are zero at θ = 0
◦and 180
◦, but maximum at θ = 90
◦.
Comparing the far ﬁeld with the plane wave, we can see that they are basically the same
except that the far-ﬁeld amplitude is inversely proportional to the distance whilst the amplitude
of the plane wave is constant. Thus, the far ﬁeld can be considered a local plane wave.
It should be pointed out that the far-ﬁeld condition is actually not that straightforward. The
condition of r ≫λ/2π was introduced for electrically small antennas and is just a function of
the frequency and not linked to the antenna dimensions. When the antenna size D is electrically
large, D > λ, the common deﬁnition of the far-ﬁeld condition is
r > 2D2
λ
(4.9)
This is obtained under the condition that the maximum phase difference from any point on the
antenna to the receiving point is less than π/8.
If an antenna cannot be considered electrically large, the recommended far-ﬁeld condition is
r > 3λ ≫λ/2π
(4.10)
and some people use 10λ or other conditions which are also aimed at ensuring that the ﬁeld is
really far enough to be considered a local plane wave. For example, a half-wavelength dipole
has maximum dimension D = 0.5λ, 2D2/λ = 0.5λ is still too small to be considered far ﬁeld.
Thus, this additional condition is necessary.
The far-ﬁeld condition is deﬁned with certain ambiguity. Care must be taken when conduct-
ing antenna far-ﬁeld measurements. If the separation between the transmitting and receiving
antennas is not large enough, signiﬁcant errors could be generated.
4.1.1.2 Near Field
When the far-ﬁeld conditions are not met, the ﬁeld is considered near ﬁeld. The near ﬁeld of a
current element is illustrated in Figure 4.4. Since both Eθ and Er have a number of terms linked
to the frequency and distance and they are comparable, Equation (4.5) cannot be simpliﬁed. Eθ
reaches the maximum when θ = 90
◦while Er peaks when θ = 0
◦and 180
◦for a ﬁxed distance.
The region for r < λ/2π is normally called the reactive near ﬁeld. The ﬁeld changes rapidly
with distance. From its power density function S = E × H∗, we can see that
r It contains both the radiating energy (the real part) and reactive energy (the imaginary part –
it does not dissipate energy, which is like a capacitor or inductor). The latter is normally
dominant in this region.
r It has components in the r and φ directions. The former is radiating away from the source
and the latter is reactive.
Also, as shown in Figure 4.2, the electric ﬁeld strength is much greater than the magnetic ﬁeld
strength (their ratio > η) when it is close to the source.

112
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Figure 4.4
The electric ﬁeld around a dipole antenna (computer simulation)
The region between the reactive near ﬁeld and the far ﬁeld is a transition region and is known
as the radiating near ﬁeld (or Fresnel region) where the reactive ﬁeld becomes smaller than
the radiating ﬁeld. A brief summary of the three ﬁeld regions is given in Table 4.1 and Figure
4.5. For EMC engineers, the near ﬁeld is of great interest; but for antenna engineers, the far
ﬁeld is much more important than the near ﬁeld.
4.1.2 Antenna Parameters from the Field Point of View
From the ﬁeld point of view, we need to be able not only to distinguish the near ﬁeld from the
far ﬁeld, but also characterize the ﬁeld, especially the far ﬁeld, so as to obtain more detailed
information on the radiated ﬁeld characteristics. The most important parameters include the
radiation pattern, beamwidth, directivity, gain, efﬁciency factor, effective aperture, polarization
and the bandwidth. The antenna temperature and radar cross-section are key parameters for
some applications.
4.1.2.1 Radiation Pattern
The radiation pattern of an antenna is a plot of the radiated ﬁeld/power as a function of
the angle at a ﬁxed distance, which should be large enough to be considered far ﬁeld. The
three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the electrically short current element is plotted in
Figure 4.6. The 3D pattern is an excellent illustration of the radiated ﬁeld distribution as a
function of angle θ and φ in space. Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult and also very time-consuming

Radiated ﬁeld regions of an antenna of maximum dimension D
to measure the 3D pattern of an antenna in practice. Most antennas have certain symmetrical
features, thus, in reality, the most important patterns are the radiation patterns in the two main
planes: the E-plane and the H-plane. The E-plane is the plane that the electric ﬁeld E lies on,
while the H-plane is the plane that the magnetic ﬁeld H is on. For the ideal current element
case, the electric ﬁeld is Eθ and the magnetic ﬁeld is Hφ, thus the E-plane pattern is the ﬁeld
Eθ measured as a function of θ when the angle φ and the distance are ﬁxed, while the H-plane
pattern is the ﬁeld Eθ measured as a function of φ when the angle θ and the distance are ﬁxed.
The E-plane (at φ = 0) and H-plane (at θ = π/2) patterns of the short current element are shown
in Figure 4.7. Obviously, this antenna has an omnidirectional pattern in the H-plane; this is a
desirable feature for many mobile antennas since the antenna is not sensitive to orientation.
Another special case is called the isotropic antenna, which has the same radiation power at all
angles. This is a hypothetical case and cannot be realized in practice, but we do sometimes use
it as a reference for analysis.
It should be pointed out that the H-plane pattern is actually a measure of the electric ﬁeld, not
the magnetic ﬁeld. When we talk about the radiation pattern, it always means the electric ﬁeld
or the power (which is proportional to the electric ﬁeld squared) pattern. When the patterns are
plotted on a linear scale, the ﬁeld pattern and power pattern may look very different. However,
when the patterns are plotted on a logarithmic scale (dB plot), both the normalized ﬁeld and
power patterns are the same since 10 log(P/Pmax) is the same as 20 log(E/Emax). Thus, in
practice, we often plot the patterns in dB scale, which also makes it easy to see details of the ﬁeld
or power over a large dynamic range, especially some minor side lobes. It should be pointed out
that if the electric ﬁeld has more than one component, we normally need to plot each component
pattern. The total radiation pattern is useful for gaining an overall view of the radiation.

In addition to the 3D and 2D polar plots, another popular way to plot the radiation pattern
is given in Figure 4.8 (also called the rectangular plot or universal plot). In this example, the
horizontal axis is the rotation angle θ and the vertical axis is the radiated power in dB, which
is normalized to the maximum – this is a very common practice since the radiation pattern
is about the relative power distribution as a function of angle and the absolute value is not
important as long as it is above the noise ﬂoor.
The radiation pattern contains a lot of useful information about the radiation characteristics
of the antenna, some cannot be quantiﬁed (such as the shape of the pattern) and some can be
quantiﬁed. Some of the most important ones are:
r the half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of the main lobe, also called the 3dB beamwidth or just
the beamwidth (to identify how sharp the beam is);
r the 10 dB beamwidth or ﬁrst null beamwidth (FNBW) (another one capturing the main beam
shape);
r the ﬁrst side-lobe level (expressed in dB, relative to the peak of the main beam);
r the front-to-back ratio (the peak of the main lobe over the peak of the back lobe, another
attempt to identify the directivity of the antenna);
r null positions (sometimes used for anti-interference and positioning).

4.1.2.2 Directivity
From the ﬁeld point of view, the most important quantitative information on the antenna is the
directivity, which is a measure of the concentration of radiated power in a particular direction.
It is deﬁned as the ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction from the antenna to the
radiation intensity averaged over all directions. The average radiation intensity is equal to the
total radiated power divided by 4π. If the direction is not speciﬁed, the direction of maximum
radiation is implied. Mathematically, the directivity (dimensionless) can be written as
D = U(θ, φ)
U(θ, φ)av
= 4πU(θ, φ)
Pt
= 4πU(θ, φ)

⃝

(4.11)
where Pt is the total radiated power in W and U is the radiation intensity in W/unit solid angle.
It is linked to the averaged radiated power density Sav (it has a unit of W/m2) by distance
squared, that is

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
The maximum directivity occurs at θ = π/2, it is
D0 = 1.5 = 1.76 dBi
It is conventional to use the isotropic antenna as the reference, thus the directivity is normally
expressed in dBi, and in this case the maximum directivity is 1.76 dBi. This means that the
antenna radiates 1.76 dB more at the maximum direction than an isotropic antenna when the
same amount of power is radiated. Sometimes, a half-wavelength dipole antenna is used as a
reference; in this case, the directivity is expressed in dBd, where d is for dipole.
Foradirectionalantennawithonemainlobe,thedirectivityiscloselylinkedtothehalf-power
beamwidth in the E- and H- planes. If the beamwidths are known, there is an approximation
which can be employed to calculate the directivity:
D ≈
4π
θHPφHP
(4.13)
where θHP and φHP are the half-power beamwidths at the two principal orthogonal planes,
expressed in radians. If they are given in degrees, this equation can be rewritten as
D ≈41253◦
θH PφH P
≈41000◦
θH PφH P
(4.14)
The validity of these two equations is based on the assumption that the pattern has only one
major lobe. They are not suitable for calculating the directivity of, for example, the short current
element, since this kind of antenna is not directional (but omnidirectional) in the H-plane and
there is no HPBW in the H-plane.
4.1.2.3 Gain and Radiation Efﬁciency of Antennas
In practice, the total input power to an antenna can be obtained easily, but the total radiated
power by an antenna is actually hard to get. The gain of an antenna is introduced to solve
this problem. This is deﬁned as the ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction from
the antenna to the total input power accepted by the antenna divided by 4π. If the direction
is not speciﬁed, the direction of maximum radiation is implied. Mathematically, the gain
(dimensionless) can be written as
G = 4πU
Pin
(4.15)
where U is again the radiation intensity in W/unit solid angle and Pin is the total input power
acceptedbytheantennainW.Itshouldbepointedoutthattheinputpowermaybedifferentfrom
the input power accepted by the antenna when the feed line is not matched with the antenna.
The voltage reﬂection coefﬁcient  at the antenna input and the match efﬁciency = 1 −||2
(Equation (4.41)) will be discussed later in the chapter. Basically, the feed line is matched with
the antenna,  = 0 and the matching efﬁciency is 100%.

Antenna Basics
117
Comparing Equations (4.11) and (4.15), we can see that the gain is linked to the directivity by
G = Pt
Pin
D = ηeD
(4.16)
Where ηe is called the radiation efﬁciency factor of the antenna and is the ratio of the radiated
power to the input power accepted by the antenna:
ηe = Pt
Pin
(4.17)
This efﬁciency factor has taken both the conductor loss and dielectric loss into account, but
not the impedance mismatch between the feed line and the antenna. Further discussion, from
the circuit point of view, will be presented in the next section, which includes another formula
to calculate this factor.
Example 4.2: Gain and radiated power. If the efﬁciency of the antenna in Example 4.1 is
50%, the VSWR at the antenna input is 3 and the input/supplied power is 1 W, ﬁnd:
a. the power gain;
b. the total radiated power
Solution:
a. From Example 4.1, we know the directivity D = 1.5. Since the efﬁciency factor ηe = 50% =
0.5, the power gain
G = Pt
Pin
D = ηeD = 0.75 or −1.24 dBi.
The gain is smaller than 1 (or 0 dBi). This results from the low efﬁciency factor, which is
very common for electrically small antennas.
b. If the VSWR = 3, we can easily obtain the voltage reﬂection coefﬁcient using Equation
(2.42) as
 = 3 −1
3 + 1 = 0.5
this means a matching efﬁciency of 1 −0.52 = 0.75 = 75%. Since the input power is 1 W,
the total input power accepted by the antenna is 0.75 W and the total radiated power:
Pt = ηe Pin = 0.5 × 0.75 = 0.375(W) = −4.26 dB
4.1.2.4 EIRP
The antenna gain is often incorporated into a parameter called the effective isotropic radiated
power, or EIRP, which is the amount of power that would have been radiated by an isotropic

118
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
antenna to produce the peak power density observed in the direction of maximum antenna
gain, that is
EIRP = PtG
(4.18)
where Pt is the radiated power. The EIRP is often stated in dBi. The advantage of expressing the
power in terms of EIRP is that the pathloss between the transmitting antenna and the receiving
antenna can be obtained easily by the ratio of the transmitted to the received EIRP; this is why
in the mobile radio industry EIRP is widely used.
From the EIRP and the knowledge of the gain of an antenna, it is possible to calculate
its radiated power and ﬁeld strength values. For example, if the antenna’s EIRP = 10 dBW
(or just say 10 dB in practice) and the gain G = 7 dBi, the radiated power from the antenna
is 3 dB.
Another closely related term is the effective radiated power, ERP, which is also widely used
in the industry. The radiated power is calculated using a half-wavelength dipole rather than an
isotropic antenna as reference, thus
ERP(dBW) = EIRP(dBW) −2.15dBi
(4.19)
Example 4.3: EIRP and ERP. Find the EIRP and ERP of the antenna in Example 4.2
Solution:
Since the gain G = 0.75 and the radiated power Pt = 0.375, we have
EIRP = PtG = 0.375 × 0.75 = 0.2813 = −5.5 dB
ERP(dBW) = EIRP(dBW) −2.15dBi = −7.65 dB
4.1.2.5 Effective Aperture and Aperture Efﬁciency
A common question about antennas is how the antenna directivity and gain are linked to its
physical dimensions. Since the ﬁeld/current on the antenna aperture is not uniform, the concept
of antenna effective aperture is introduced to serve this purpose. The effective aperture Ae is
less than the physical aperture Ap; the aperture efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio of these two,
that is
ηap = Ae
Ap
(4.20)
This is normally in the range of 50 to 80%, and the effective aperture can be found as
Ae = λ2
4π D
(4.21)

Antenna Basics
119
Thus, it is proportional to the directivity of the antenna, and the directivity can also be expressed
in terms of the aperture size and aperture efﬁciency:
D = 4π
λ2 Ae = 4π
λ2 ηap Ap
(4.22)
If the power density S at the receiving antenna is known, we can use the following equation
to estimate the received power:
Pr = SAe
(4.23)
Example 4.4: Effective aperture. The directivity of a pyramidal horn antenna of aperture width
a and height b is
D = 6.4ab
λ2
Find its aperture efﬁciency. If the power density around the antenna is 1 W/m2, ﬁnd the received
power.
Solution:
Its effective aperture is
Ae = λ2
4π D = 6.4
4π ab = 0.5093ab
Its physical aperture Ap = ab, thus the aperture efﬁciency is
ηap = Ae
Ap
= 50.93%
If the incoming power density is 1 W/m2, the received power is
Pr = SAe = 0.5093ab (W)
This means the larger the aperture, the larger the received power.
4.1.2.6 Effective Height and the Antenna Factor
If an antenna is a wire-type antenna (such as a dipole), the effective height (he) may be used
to replace the effective aperture. The effective height is proportional to the square root of the
effective aperture. It is deﬁned as the ratio of induced open-circuit voltage V on the antenna
to the incident electric ﬁeld E or
he = V
E ∝

Ae (m)
(4.24)

120
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Another closely related parameter is the antenna factor (AF), which is deﬁned as the ratio
of the incident electric ﬁeld E to the induced voltage V0 at the antenna terminal when it is
connected to a load/cable (50 ohms by default). This induced voltage is different from the V
in Equation (4.27). Thus
AF = E
V0
(1/m)
(4.25)
This links the radiated/received ﬁeld strength to the voltage at the antenna terminal and is a very
useful parameter for ﬁeld strength and voltage conversion in ﬁeld measurement applications.
Thus, it is a widely used device descriptor in the EMC area. However, it is not part of standard
antenna terminology. The antenna factor reﬂects the use of an antenna as a ﬁeld measuring
device or probe. It converts the reading of voltage on equipment (such as a receiver) to the
ﬁeld at the antenna. It is also linked to the gain and effective aperture of the antenna. More
information on the antenna factor can be found in [3, 4].
4.1.2.7 Antenna Temperature
The radiation from different sources is intercepted by antennas and appears at their terminals
as an antenna temperature, which is deﬁned as [5]
TA =
 2π
0
 π
0
TB(θ, φ)G(θ, φ) · sin θdθdφ
 2π
0
 π
0
G(θ, φ) · sin θdθdφ
(4.26)
where TB is the source brightness temperature of the radiation source and G is the antenna
gain pattern.
When an antenna is used for receiving purposes, the antenna temperature may be required
for system considerations and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculation. In this case, the source is
remote (such as the sky or Mars) and the antenna is just a load to the system and may be viewed
as a remote temperature-measuring device. But this temperature has nothing to do with the
physical temperature of the antenna if the antenna is a lossless device; the temperature is equal
to the source (such as the distant sky) temperature. In reality, the antenna has certain loss. An
extreme case would be one where the antenna is completely lossy, here the antenna temperature
is equal to its physical temperature. But, generally speaking, its physical temperature is partially
linked to the antenna temperature. The larger the effective aperture/gain, the larger the antenna
temperature.
4.1.2.8 Friis’s Transmission Formula and the Radar Cross-Section
Another use of the aperture concept is for the derivation of the Friis transmission formula,
which relates the power received to the power transmitted between two antennas separated by
a distance r, which is large enough to be considered in the antennas’ far ﬁeld. As shown in
Figure 4.9, from Equations (4.11) and (4.12), the radiated power density from an antenna with

(4.27)
From Equations (4.21) and (4.23), we can obtain the received power
Pr = PinGt
4πr2 · λ2
4π Dr
(4.28)
To obtain the output power from the receiving antenna, we must take the receiving antenna’s
efﬁciency factor ηer into account, thus
Pout = Prηer = PinGt
4πr2 · λ2
4π Drηer = PinGt
4πr2 · λ2
4π Gr =

(4.29)
This is the Friis transmission formula and it links the input power of the transmitting antenna
to the output power of the receiving antenna. (λ/4πr)2 is called the free space loss factor –
resultingfromthesphericalspreadingoftheradiatedenergy.Thisformulacanalsobeexpressed
using the effective aperture of both antennas (Aet and Aer) as
Pout = ηetηer
Aet Aer
λ2r2
· Pin
(4.30)
This equation has been widely used for communications and radar applications.
For radar applications, Friis’s equation can be related to the radar cross-section (RCS), σ,
which is deﬁned as the ability of a target to reﬂect the energy back to the radar and is the ratio
of the backscattered power to the incident power density; that is
σ =
scattered power
incident power density
(4.31)
It is a far-ﬁeld parameter and is expressed in m2 or dBsm (decibels per square meter). The
typical RCS for a jumbo jet aircraft is about 100 m2, for a ﬁghter aircraft about 4 m2, for an
adult man 1 m2 and for a bird 0.01 m2. It is not a function of frequency.
The power density in Equation (4.27) can be considered the incident power density on
the target, and the part reﬂected back to the radar is σ S/4πr2 and the output power at the

122
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
radar antenna is
Pout = ηe Ae · σ S/4πr2 =
σλ2
(4π)3r4 G2
t · Pin
(4.32)
Thus, the received power is proportional to λ2, but now inversely proportional to r4, not r2.
4.1.2.9 Polarization
The antenna polarization is the same as the polarization of its radiating wave. As discussed
in Chapter 3, there are basically three types of polarization: linear, circular and elliptical.
Which polarization is generated depends on how the current moves in the antenna. For a
linear polarization, the current should travel along one axis; for a circular polarization, two
orthogonal currents with 90-degree phase offset should be created on the antenna. In practice,
mixed polarizations may be found in many antennas since an antenna has to meet many
requirements. Trade-offs may have to be made and as a result a pure linearly polarized or
circularly polarized antenna may not be possible or necessary. For example, most of the mobile
phone antennas are not purely linearly polarized since they are employed to receive signals with
mixedpolarizations.However,foraline-of-sightcommunicationsystem,thepolarizationhasto
be matched in order to achieve the maximum efﬁciency of the whole system. Two orthogonally
polarized antennas cannot communicate with each other due to polarization mismatch. More
discussion will be provided in Section 5.4.3.
4.1.2.10 Bandwidth
Many antenna parameters are functions of frequency. When the frequency is changed, the
radiation pattern may also be changed, which may result in changes to the directivity, gain,
HPBW and other parameters. Thus, it is important to ensure that the right parameters are
chosen when the antenna bandwidth is considered.
4.2 Antennas to Transmission Lines
4.2.1 Antenna Parameters from the Circuit Point of View
As we mentioned earlier, the antenna is a transition device linking the transmission line and
radio waves; thus, from the circuit point of view, the antenna is just a load to a transmission
line. As shown in Figure 4.10, the most important parameter is, therefore, its impedance.
4.2.1.1 Input Impedance and Radiation Resistance
Antenna input impedance (Za) is deﬁned as the impedance presented by an antenna at its
terminals or the ratio of the voltage to current at its terminals. Mathematically, the input
impedance is
Za = Vin
Iin
= Ra + j Xa
(4.33)

Antenna Basics

where Vin and Iin are the input voltage and current at the antenna input, respectively. The input
impedance is a complex number; the real part consists of two components:
Ra = Rr + RL
(4.34)
where Rr is the radiation resistance and RL is the loss resistance of the antenna.
The radiation resistance is equivalent to the resistance which would dissipate the same
amount of power as the antenna radiates when the current equals the input current at the
terminals. If the total radiated power is Pt, then
Rr = 2Pt
I 2
in
(4.35)
The loss resistance is from conductor loss and dielectric loss if lossy materials are used.
If the antenna is directly connected to a source of impedance Zs, for a matched load the
following condition should be met:
Zs = Z∗
a = Ra −j Xa
(4.36)
In reality, the antenna is normally connected to a short transmission line with a standard
characteristic impedance of 50  or 75 . Thus, the desired antenna input impedance is 50 
or 75 .
4.2.1.2 Reﬂection Coefﬁcient, Return Loss and VSWR
Impedance matching is extremely important. Since the antenna is just a load to a transmission
line from the circuit point of view, we know that the reﬂection coefﬁcient, return loss and
voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) can be used to judge how well a load is matched with the
transmission line, from the transmission line theory in Chapter 2. All these three parameters
are interlinked. The speciﬁc representations are as follows:
r reﬂection coefﬁcient (a complex number):
 = Za −Z0
Za + Z0
(4.37)

Za + Z0

(4.38)
r VSWR (a ratio between 1 and inﬁnity)
VSWR = 1 + ||
1 −||
(4.39)
The commonly required speciﬁcation of an antenna is L RT > 10 dB or VSWR < 2. These
two are actually very close, as seen in Table 2.1. For mobile phone antennas, it is also common
to specify VSWR < 3 or L RT > 6 dB.
4.2.1.3 Radiation Efﬁciency, Matching Efﬁciency and Total Efﬁciency
The radiation efﬁciency was deﬁned by Equation (4.17) and can be calculated using the radiated
power and the input power accepted by the antenna. Since they are linked directly to the
radiation resistance and loss resistance, the radiation efﬁciency factor can also be calculated
using the following equation
ηe = Pt
Pin
=
Rr
Rr + RL
(4.40)
From the efﬁciency point of view, the larger the radiation resistance, the larger the efﬁciency
factor. But from the system matching point of view, we need the radiation resistance to match
with the characteristic impedance of the line and the loss resistance to be zero if possible. This
is the fundamental requirement for an antenna from the circuit point of view.
If the input impedance of an antenna is not matched with the feeder impedance, then a part
of the signal from the source will be reﬂected back; there is a reﬂection (mismatch) loss. This
is characterized by the matching efﬁciency (also known as reﬂection efﬁciency), as mentioned
earlier, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the input power accepted by the antenna to the source
supplied power (Ps):
ηm = Pin
Ps
= 1 −||2
(4.41)
Thus, the total efﬁciency of the antenna system (feed and the antenna) is the product of the
two efﬁciencies:
ηt = Pt
Ps
= ηmηe
(4.42)
This has taken the feed-antenna mismatch into account.

4.2.1.4 Bandwidth
From the circuit point of view, the antenna bandwidth is a simple but important parameter.
It is normally deﬁned as the frequency bandwidth with L RT > 10 dB or VSWR < 2. Take
Figure 4.11 as an example, which is a zoomed version of Figure 2.19; the center frequency of
the antenna is 1000 MHz. For the required VSWR < 2, the bandwidth for Design A is from
975 MHz to 1026 MHz, whilst the bandwidth for Design B is from 990 MHz to 1012 MHz,
and the relative bandwidths for these two designs are 5.1% and 2.2%, respectively. Both are
narrowband.
The antenna bandwidth is a very special parameter since we need to consider the parameter
from both the circuit point of view (VSWR or L RT ) and the ﬁeld point of view (radiation pattern).
It is normally easy to meet one of the requirements but difﬁcult to meet both requirements –
this is particularly true for a broadband antenna, which normally means that its VSWR and
radiation pattern have a relative bandwidth of at least 20%. In some applications, a much wider
bandwidth is required.
4.3 Summary
In this chapter we have introduced the basic theory of antennas – the essence of antenna design
is how to control the current distribution, which determines the radiation pattern and input
impedance. A detailed discussion on antenna near ﬁelds and far ﬁelds has been conducted. All
the important parameters of an antenna, which have been grouped from the ﬁeld point of view
and the circuit point of view, have been deﬁned and discussed. A summary of these parameters
is given in Figure 4.12. The Friis transmission formula and RCS have also been addressed.
It is worth pointing out that an antenna can be viewed as a two-port network, thus the ﬁeld
quantities (such as the radiation pattern) are related to the transmission coefﬁcient (S21) while
the circuit quantities (such as the input impedance and VSWR) are determined by the reﬂection
coefﬁcient (S11) of the network.

Popular Antennas
Chapter 4 has covered the basics of antennas and laid down the foundation for us to gain a
better understanding of antennas. In this chapter we are going to examine and analyze some of
the most popular antennas using relevant theories, to see why they have become popular, what
their major features and properties (including advantages and disadvantages) are and how they
should be designed.
Since the start of radio communications over 100 years ago, thousands of antennas have
been developed. They can be categorized by various criteria:
r in terms of the bandwidth, antennas can be divided into narrowband and broadband antennas;
r in terms of the polarization, they can be classiﬁed as linearly polarized or circularly polarized
antennas (or even elliptically polarized antennas);
r in terms of the resonance, they can be grouped as resonant or traveling wave antennas;
r in terms of the number of elements, they can be organiz as element antennas or antenna
arrays.
In this book we separate them according to their physical structures into wire-type antennas
and aperture-type antennas. This is because different types of antenna exhibit different features
and can be analyzed using different methods and techniques. Since antenna arrays can be
formed by both types and possess some special features, they will be discussed in Section 5.3.
5.1 Wire-Type Antennas
Wire-type antennas are made of conducting wires and are generally easy to construct, thus
the cost is normally low. Examples include dipoles, monopoles, loops, helices, Yagi–Uda and
log-periodic antennas
5.1.1 Dipoles
Dipoles are one of the simplest but most widely used types of antenna. Hertz used them for
his famous experiment. As shown in Figure 5.1, a dipole can be considered a structure evolved

Current distribution
Figure 5.1
Evolution of a dipole of total length 2l and diameter d
from an open-end, two-wire transmission line. A typical structure of a dipole consists of two
metal wires which are normally of equal length.
In Chapter 4, an ideal short element of constant current was discussed. In reality, we cannot
ﬁnd such an antenna since the current is zero at the end of a line. As we now understand, for
antenna analysis and design, it is all about the current distribution. Once the current distri-
bution is known, other parameters, such as the radiation pattern and input impedance, can be
obtained.
5.1.1.1 Current Distribution
For an open-end transmission line, the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the end (z = 0) is 1. From
Equation (2.20), the current distribution along such a line can be expressed as
I(z, t) = Re
 1
Z0
(A1e j(ωt−βz) −A1e j(ωt+βz))

= 2
Z0
A1 sin(ωt) sin(βz)
(5.1)
This is a standing wave with peaks at z = λ/4 + nλ/2 (n are integers). If the dipole is very thin
(ideally zero diameter), the current distribution can be approximated by this equation. That is,
if the coordinate origin is chosen at the center of the dipole in Figure 5.1, the current can be
expressed as
I(z) =

I0 sin(β(l −z)),
0 ≤z ≤l
I0 sin(β(l + z)),
−l ≤z ≤0
(5.2)
where I0 is the maximum possible current (different from the current at the feeding point) on
the line. If the dipole length is shorter than λ/2, the maximum current on the dipole is less than
I0. This could be very confusing. The time term sin(ωt) is omitted from the representation.
Thus, the current along the dipole is a time-varying standing wave. From Equation (5.2), we
can see that the current is
r zero at the end of the pole;

The E-plane radiation patterns for the length 2l = λ/10, λ/2, λ and 1.5λ are shown in Table
5.1. It is apparent that the current distribution indeed determines the radiation pattern. When
the dipole length is less than a wavelength, the currents on both poles have the same polarity
and there is only one lobe on both sides and no side lobes. But when the length is greater
than a wavelength, the currents on the dipole become complicated; they travel in two opposite
directions, which results in a split of the radiation pattern. ‘+’ and ‘−’ in the plots indicate
opposite directions of the current phase.

It is not possible to ﬁnd a simple expression for the directivity. A numerical solution can be
found once the frequency and dipole length are known.

The gain of the antenna can be obtained by Equations (4.16) and (4.34). We need to know
what material is used to make the antenna in order to calculate the gain. An example is given
in Example 5.1.
The directivities for the dipole of length 2l = λ/10, λ/2, λ and 1.5λ are also shown in
Table 5.1. The half-power beamwidths (HPBWs) for these antennas are given in the table as
well. The directivity increases with the dipole length and reaches a ﬁrst maximum (about 3.2)
when the length is around 1.25λ (not shown in the table) [1, 2]. The relation between the
directivity and beamwidth in Equation (4.13) cannot be applied to this kind of antenna. For
some antennas, their HPBWs may be about the same, but their radiation patterns could actually
be very different. Thus, it is essential to obtain the 2D or even 3D radiation pattern and not to
rely purely on the HPBW to judge the radiation characteristics of an antenna.
5.1.1.4 Radiation Resistance and Input Impedance

This complex expression is not really suitable for applications. A lot of effort has been made
to make it simpler and easier to use. One such attempt can be found in [3]. If the loss resistance
is neglected, the input impedance of a dipole less than a wavelength can be approximated as

f2(βl) = −0.4456 + 17.0082βl −8.6793(βl)2 + 9.6031(βl)3
d is the diameter of the dipole.

134
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
This formula is valid only when the dipole length is not much longer than half a wavelength
with an error up to 0.5 
. In practice, this is the most useful range. If the impedance for a
longer dipole is to be calculated, the best approach is to use numerical computation (software
packages are widely available on the market), which will be addressed in Chapter 6.
For an electrically short dipole, Equation (5.11) can be further simpliﬁed to
Za ≈20(βl)2 −j120

(5.13)
This expression clearly indicates that
r The radiation resistance (the real part of Za in this case) is proportional to the square of the
dipole length and inversely proportional to the wavelength squared.
r The reactance of the input impedance is a function of the radius and length of the dipole.
The smaller the radius, the larger the amplitude of the reactance. It is proportional to the
wavelength.
The input impedances for the dipole of length 2l = λ/10, λ/2, λ and 1.5λ are also shown
in Table 5.1. It should be pointed out that the reactance of the input impedance is very sensitive
to the radius of the dipole. The only exception is when the length is near half of the wavelength,
the very ﬁrst resonant length. Although 2l = λ and 1.5λ may also be considered resonant cases,
they are very sensitive to a change in the radius. If the radius is not negligible, they are actually
not resonant. A good illustration of the input impedance as a function of the normalized dipole
length (and frequency) is given in Figure 5.2 [1], where three dipole antennas of different radii

are given. We can see that
r All dipoles are resonant near half-wavelength (due to the non-zero radius, the resonant length
is slightly shorter than λ/2), but not at one wavelength.
r The fatter (larger radius) the dipole, the broader the bandwidth.
5.1.1.5 Why the Half-Wavelength Dipole is the Most Popular Dipole
Based on the discussions above, we can conclude that the following four reasons make the λ/2
dipole very popular:
r Its radiation pattern is omnidirectional in the H-plane, which is required by many applications
(including mobile communications).
r Its directivity (2.15 dBi) is reasonable – larger than short dipoles although smaller than that
of the full-wavelength dipole.
r The antenna is longer than a short dipole but much shorter than the full-wavelength dipole,
hence it is a good trade-off between the directivity and size.
r The input impedance is not sensitive to the radius and is about 73 
, which is well matched
with a standard transmission line of characteristic impedance 75 
 or 50 
 (with VSWR
< 2). This is probably the most important and unique reason.
Thus, for overall performance, the half-wavelength dipole antenna is a deﬁnite winner.
Example 5.1: Short dipole. A dipole of length 2l = 3 cm and diameter d = 2 mm is made of
copper wire (σ = 5.7 × 107 S/m) for mobile communications. If the operational frequency is
1 GHz,
a. obtain its radiation pattern and directivity;
b. calculate its input impedance, radiation resistance and radiation efﬁciency;
c. if this antenna is also used as a ﬁeld probe at 100 MHz for EMC applications, ﬁnd its
radiation efﬁciency again, and express it in dB.
Solution:
Since the frequency is 1 GHz, the wavelength λ = 30 cm, 2l/λ = 0.1 and βl = 0.1π.
a. It is a short dipole, therefore we use Equation (5.8) to yield the radiation pattern. The 3D
and the normalized E-plane patterns are shown in Figures 4.6 and 5.3 respectively. The
H-plane pattern (φ) is omnidirectional. The HPBW in the E-plane is 90 degrees (from 45
to 135 degrees in the ﬁgure), as indicated in Table 5.1. This plot is almost exactly the same
as that obtained by using Equation (5.7) with an error < 0.03 dB.
Using Equations (5.8) and (4.9) we ﬁnd directivity to be 1.5 or 1.76 dBi.
b. Equation (5.13) can be employed to obtain the input impedance, the result is
Za = 1.93 −j652

(If (5.12) was used, the result would be Za = 2.34 −j634

To calculate the loss resistance, we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd out the skin depth. Using Equation
(3.49), the skin depth in this case is
δ ≈
	
1
π f μσ =

1
π × 109 × 4π × 10−7 × 5.7 × 107 = 2.1 × 10−6 (m)
It is much smaller than the radius of the wire. Thus, we need to use Equation (3.50) to
compute the loss resistance of the dipole:
RL ≈2l√f μ
d√πσ ≈0.04 
Since Equation (5.13) has not taken the loss resistance into account, the more accurate input
impedance is
Za = 1.97 −j652 
and the radiation efﬁciency is
ηe =
Rr
Rr + RL
=
1.93
1.93 + 0.04 = 97.97%
c. The frequency is now 100 MHz and the wavelength λ = 300 cm, thus 2l/λ = 0.01 and
βl = 0.01π. This is an electrically small antenna; we can use the same approach as in b. to
obtain:
The antenna input impedance (without ohmic loss): Za = 0.0197 −j6524.3 (
)
The skin depth: δ ≈6.67 × 10−6 < d/2
The loss resistance: RL ≈0.0126 (

Thus, the radiation efﬁciency is

Rr + RL
=
0.0197
0.0197 + 0.0126 = 60.99% or −2.14 dB
This efﬁciency is much lower than that at 1 GHz. Normally, electrically small antennas have
low efﬁciencies and high reactances, which is why they are not popular in applications even
though they are small in size. Sometimes we do employ short dipoles for reception where
signal-to-noise ratio is more important than the radiation efﬁciency.
In addition to cylindrical dipoles, there are many other forms of dipoles developed for various
applications. For example, as shown in Figure 5.4, the biconical antenna offers a much wider
bandwidth than the conventional cylindrical dipole; a bow-tie antenna has a broad bandwidth
and low proﬁle; while a sleeve dipole can be nicely fed by a coaxial cable and exhibits a wide
bandwidth. A λ/2 folded dipole may be viewed as a superposition of two half-wavelength
dipoles with an input impedance of around 280 
, which is close to the standard characteristic
impedance of 300 
 for a two-wire transmission line. That is why it was widely used for TV
reception in the good old days (in the 50s and 60s). More details about these and other forms of
dipoles, as well as the effects of parameters such as the feeding gap, may be found in [2, 3, 4].
5.1.2 Monopoles and Image Theory
The monopole antenna is half of the dipole antenna, as shown in Figure 5.5. There are a lot of
similarities between them, but there are also some differences. The best way to investigate the
monopole is to utilize the image theory.
5.1.2.1 The Image Theory
The image theory states that if there is a current A/B/C above an inﬁnite perfect conducting
ground plane, the ground will act as a mirror to generate its image, A’/B’/C’, as shown in
Figure 5.6. A and B are the two basis currents; any other case, such as C, may be viewed as a
combination of these two currents. The ﬁeld at any point above the ground plane is equivalent

Figure 5.5
A monopole antenna with a coaxial feed line
to the ﬁeld generated by the current A/B/C and its image A’/B’/C’ without the presence of the
ground plane.
The image current is of the same amplitude as the original source and its direction is
determined by the boundary conditions, such as that stating that the tangential electric ﬁeld
must be zero at the boundary. Using the image theory, we can remove the ground plane and
treat the problem as if it were in free space but had a pair of current sources.
5.1.2.2 Monopole Antennas
Applying the image theory to the monopole in Figure 5.5, we can see that it is equivalent to
the case of B–B’ in Figure 5.6, which is a dipole with length 2l in free space. The current
distribution along the pole is the same as the dipole discussed earlier, thus the radiation pattern
is the same above the ground plane and can be represented by Equation (5.7) with 0 ≤θ ≤π/2.
Since the power is only radiated to the upper half space and the power to the lower half space
is reﬂected back to the upper space, this results in an increased directivity. The directivity of
a monopole is therefore twice that of its dipole counterpart – this can also be obtained using
Equation (5.9) when the range of the integral is changed to 0 ≤θ ≤π/2.
The input impedance is changed as well. For a dipole, the voltage across the input points
of the poles is V −(−V ) = 2V , while for a monopole, the voltage is between the pole and
the ground plane, which is V . The input currents for both the dipole and monopole are the
same. Thus, the input impedance of the monopole is half that of its corresponding dipole. A
summary of the characteristics of some monopoles is given in Table 5.2. Compared with the
dipole, the monopole has the following advantages:
r the size is half of the corresponding dipole’s;
r the directivity doubles that of its corresponding dipole;
r the input impedance is half of its corresponding dipole’s.

The quarter-wavelength monopole is a resonant antenna, like the half-wavelength dipole, its
input impedance is about 37 
, which matches well with the 50 
 standard transmission line
(with VSWR = 1.35 < 2). All these good reasons have made the quarter-wavelength monopole
one of the most popular antennas. We can ﬁnd applications almost everywhere, from radio
broadcasting towers to mobile phones.
Just like dipoles, there are many derivatives of monopole antennas developed to suit different
applications. Some are shown in Figure 5.7. More detailed discussion will be presented in
Chapter 8.
5.1.2.3 Effects of a Ground Plane
The above analysis and characteristics of monopoles are based on the assumption that there is
an inﬁnite perfect conducting ground plane. But in reality, we normally do not have an inﬁnite
ground plane or the ground plane is not a perfect conductor (like earth). What are the effects
on the monopole?
All parameters of the monopole (radiation pattern, gain and input impedance are just some
examples) may be affected by the ground plane.

Some popular forms of monopole antennas
If the conducting ground plane is of limited size, the radiated power will leak to the lower
half of the space, which means that the radiation pattern is changed. There may be side or even
back lobes. The edge of the ground plane will diffract the waves, which results in many side
lobes, as shown in Figure 5.8. The maximum angle is changed (tilted towards the sky) and
the directivity is reduced. Also, the input impedance may be changed. If the ground plane is
not large enough, it can act as a radiator rather than a ground plane. As a rule of thumb, the
diameter of the ground plane should be at least one wavelength.
If the ground plane is very large but not made of a good conductor, all the antenna properties
are affected, especially the directivity and gain (reduced); the angle to the maximum radiation

Transmission line to loop antenna and its corresponding dipoles

be found in [2].
5.1.3 Loops and the Duality Principle
Loops are another simple and versatile wire-type antenna. They take many different conﬁgu-
rations, which include circular, square, rectangular, triangular, elliptical and other shapes.
While the dipole is considered to be a conﬁguration evolved from an open-end transmission
line, the loop can be viewed as a conﬁguration evolved from a short-end transmission line,
as shown in Figure 5.9. Thus, for a small (electrically small) loop, the current is large and
the voltage is small – this results in a small input impedance, which is very different from a
short dipole whose impedance, more precisely the reactance, is very large. We could use the
conventional method to obtain a loop’s properties by ﬁnding its current distribution ﬁrst, but
this is time-consuming and cumbersome. Since we have already studied dipoles properly, we
are going to use another method, the duality principle, to ﬁnd the characteristics of a loop,
which is easier and more straightforward.
5.1.3.1 Duality Principle
Duality means the state of combining two different things which are closely linked. In antennas,
the duality theory means that it is possible to write the ﬁelds of one antenna from the ﬁeld
expressions of the other antenna by interchanging parameters.
From Chapters 1 and 4, we know that the ﬁrst two Maxwell equations are
∇× E1 = −jωμ1H1
∇× H1 = Je + jωε1E1
(5.14)
where E1 and H1 are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds generated by electric current density Je
in Medium 1 (ε1 and μ1).

Now suppose we have a ﬁctitious magnetic current source with magnetic current density Jm
in Medium 2 (ε2 and μ2); Maxwell’s equations for this new scenario can be written as
∇× H2 = jωε2E2
∇× E2 = −Jm −jωμ2H2
(5.15)
where E2 and H2 are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds generated by Jm in Medium 2 (εy
and μy).
Thus, System 1 with the electric current and System 2 with the magnetic current are duals
and their parameters can be exchanged, as shown in Table 5.3. Note that the duality links not
only the ﬁeld parameters but also the material properties; there is also a sign change from the
magnetic ﬁeld to the electric ﬁeld.
5.1.3.2 Small Loops
The implementation of the duality principle is simple. For small loops (circumference C =
2πa < λ/3), the current can be considered a constant. It has been found that a magnetic current
Iml is equivalent to a small loop of radius a and constant electric current I0 provided that
Iml = jωμSI0
(5.16)
where S = πa2 (area of the loop). This means that their radiated ﬁelds are identical. As shown
in Figure 5.9, using the duality principle, it is possible to write the ﬁelds of the magnetic current
from the ﬁeld expressions of the electric current antenna by interchanging parameters. From
Equations (4.6) and (4.7), the far ﬁeld of a short electric current is given as
Eθ = j Il
4πr ηβ sin θe−jβr
Hφ = j Il
4πr β sin θe−jβr
Er = Eφ = 0; Hr = Hθ = 0

The radiation pattern looks the same as a short dipole, as shown in Figure 5.10, except that the
polarization is now Eφ (not Eθ, but still linearly polarized), which is in the plane of the loop.
The maximum radiation occurs at θ = π/2, which is also in the loop plane.
The directivity of a small loop is the same as that of a small dipole, which is 1.5 or 1.76 dBi.
Using the radiated ﬁeld expressions in (5.18), the radiation resistance is found as

(5.19)
where C is the circumference of the small loop. If it is not a circle, C is then the total length
of the loop. Comparing Equation (5.19) with a dipole’s radiation resistance, given in Equation
(5.13), we can see that the loop radiation resistance is more sensitive to changes in the length
and wavelength. For a loop and dipole of the same length, the radiation resistance of the loop
antenna is much smaller.

where b is the diameter of the wire. This equation takes both the external inductive reactance
(the ﬁrst term) and internal reactance (the second term) of the loop conductor into account.
For impedance matching, a capacitor in series is required for a small loop.
5.1.3.3 Loop Antenna: General Case
If a loop cannot be considered small, the current distribution cannot be regarded as constant.
As a result, many properties of the loop are changed and results obtained for a constant current
cannot be applied to real antennas. It has been shown that, when the circumference of the
loop becomes comparable with the wavelength, its maximum radiation shifts to its axis (θ = 0
and π), which is perpendicular to the plane of the loop [5]. This is very different from a
small loop. There is no simple mathematical expression for the radiated ﬁeld from such a loop
antenna. Computer simulations are really the best choice if a 3D radiation pattern is required.
The directivity of a circular loop as a function of the circumference in wavelengths (C/λ) for
a/b = 40 and θ = 0 is shown in Figure 5.11. The maximum directivity is about 4.5 dBi when
the circumference is near 1.4λ. It should be pointed out that the directivity is fairly independent
of the radius of the wire (b) for C/λ < 1.4λ.
The one-wavelength loop (the circumference C = λ) is commonly referred to as a resonant
loop. The current in the loop is approximately I0 cos φ (maximum at the input) and is ap-
proximately equivalent to two λ/2 dipoles separated by 2a (= λ/π), as shown in Figure 5.12.
Eθ, Eφ and the total radiation patterns of this antenna are plotted in Figure 5.13. Eθ is zero
in the horizontal plane θ = π/2 and in the vertical plane φ = 0, π, while Eφ is small in the
vertical plane φ = π/2, 3π/2. The maximum is indeed shifted to the axis, which can be easily
explained using the model in Figure 5.12. The directivity of the antenna is around 2.2 or 3.4
dBi (larger than for a λ/2 dipole). The input resistance is about 100 
, which is a reasonable
value for matching to a standard 50 or 75 
 transmission line. However, the input reactance in

this case is actually about −100 
 (not sensitive to a change of radius). The resonance occurs
when C is slightly larger than λ, as seen in Figure 5.14.
The input impedance of a loop with the circumference C = 6 cm (the corresponding fre-
quency is 5 GHz) is shown in Figure 5.14. The input resistance reaches the ﬁrst maximum
at about C/λ = 0.5 (at 2.5 GHz, it is referred to as an anti-resonant loop), and the second
maximum is at approximately C/λ = 1.5 (it is not at 9 GHz but near 8 GHz in Figure 5.14).
It is interesting to note that the resistance curves for the loop and dipole (see Figure 5.2) are
similar, and their reactance curves are also similar but with a reference position shift of about
λ/2. This is not difﬁcult to understand using the transmission line theory: the open and short
points are shifted by λ/2 on a transmission line.
5.1.3.4 Discussion
The loop antenna has some very interesting features in terms of the input impedance and
radiation pattern, as shown in Figures 5.14 and 5.15. When the loop size is changed from
electrically small to about one wavelength, the total radiation is gradually changed from an
omnidirectional pattern in the horizontal plane to an omnidirectional pattern in the vertical
plane. If its size is further increased, the radiation pattern will no longer be omnidirectional
but will have many lobes. Thus, the loop antenna radiation pattern is much more complicated
than its dipole counterpart.

In addition to the circular loop, other forms of loop antennas have also been developed for
practical applications. Since the analysis of polygonal (such as square, rectangular, triangular
and rhombic) loops is much more complex, they have received much less attention.
Generally speaking, loop antennas have many attractive characteristics. They are of low
proﬁle and present a well-controlled radiation pattern. Balanced and unbalanced feeds are
possible (coaxial cables can be used to feed the loop or half loop [2]). Loop antennas are
usually employed for linear polarization although the shape is circular. Recently, it has been
found that a loop antenna can also radiate circularly polarized waves if a gap is introduced on
the loop [6, 7, 8].
A one-wavelength loop with a planar reﬂector has a unidirectional pattern with a relatively
high directivity (near 9 dBi) and good input impedance, which is, of course, dependent on
the distance to the reﬂector [3]. For mobile radio communications, the loop is often used in
pagers but hardly used in mobile transceivers. This may be due to its high resistance and

 transmission lines over moderate
bandwidths. With a ground plane or body, the loop antenna should be an attractive candidate
for mobile hand-portables. We expect to see more loop and derivative antennas being used in
mobile wireless communication systems.
5.1.4 Helical Antennas
As indicated earlier, the helical antenna may be viewed as a derivative of the dipole or monopole
antenna, but it can also be considered a derivative of a loop antenna. In this section we are
going to introduce this special antenna, which has some very interesting and unique features,
as Professor Kraus (who made a signiﬁcant contribution to this subject) stated in [4], ‘not
only does the helix have a nearly uniform resistive input over a wide bandwidth but it also
operates as a super-gain end-ﬁre array over the same bandwidth! Furthermore, it is non-critical
with respect to conductor size and turn spacing. It is easy to use in arrays because of almost
negligible mutual impedance’.
Geometrically, as shown in Figure 5.16, a helical antenna consists of a conductor wound
into a helical shape. It is a circularly/elliptically polarized antenna. A helix wound like a right-
hand (clockwise) screw radiates or receives right-hand circularly polarized waves, whereas a
helix wound like a left-hand (anti-clockwise) screw radiates or receives left-hand circularly
polarized waves. Although a helix can radiate in many modes, the axial (end-ﬁre) mode and
the normal (broadside) mode are the ones of most interest. The following notation is used for
the analysis:
D = diameter of helix;
s = spacing between turns;
n = number of turns;
C = circumference of helix = π D;
L = length of one turn =
√
C2 + s2.
5.1.4.1 Normal Mode Helix
The normal (broadside) mode occurs when the diameter of the helix is much smaller than the
wavelength (D ≪λ) and the total length is also smaller than the wavelength. It behaves more

148
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
like a dipole (or monopole with a ground plane) antenna. The radiation pattern is broadside to
the helix axis. In this case, the helix may be treated as the superposition of n elements, each
consisting of a small loop of diameter D and a short dipole of length s. The axes of the loop and
dipoles coincide with the axis of the helix. The far ﬁeld of a small loop is given in Equations
(5.18) and (5.16) as
Eφ = ωμSIin
4πr
β sin θe−jβr
Er = Eθ = 0
(5.21)
The far ﬁeld of a short dipole is shown in Equation (5.8) as
Eθ ≈jη Iin
4πr (βs) sin θe jβr
(5.22)
The Eθ and Eφ components of dipoles and loops are 90 degrees out of phase. The combination
of them gives a circularly or elliptically polarized wave. The axial ratio is

(5.23)
When the circumference is equal to
C = π D =
√
2sλ
(5.24)
the axial ratio becomes unity and the radiation is circularly polarized. Otherwise, the radiation
is elliptically polarized.
From Equations (5.21) and (5.22), we know that the radiation pattern is indeed a typical
ﬁgure eight (8) in the vertical plane, as shown in Figure 5.16, and omnidirectional in the
horizontal plane. The directivity is again about 1.5 and the HPBW is 90 degrees, similar to
that of a short dipole or small loop.
The input impedance is very sensitive to changes of frequency; the bandwidth is therefore
very narrow. In practice, the helix is normally used with a ground plane, the polarization is
predominantly vertical and the radiation pattern is similar to that of a monopole. In this case,
the radiation resistance can be approximately given by (25.3 ns/λ)2 [9]. These antennas tend
to be inefﬁcient radiators (depending on size and materials) and are typically used for mobile
communications where reduced size is a critical factor.
5.1.4.2 Axial Mode Helix
The axial (end-ﬁre) mode occurs when the circumference of the helix is comparable with the
wavelength (C = πD ≈λ) and the total length is much greater than the wavelength. This has
made the helix an extremely popular circularly polarized broadband antenna at the VHF and
UHF band frequencies. In this mode of operation, there is only one main lobe and its maximum
is along the axis of the helix and, as shown in Figure 5.16 (with a ground plane), there may

Popular Antennas
149
be some side lobes. The recommended parameters for an optimum design to achieve circular
polarization are:
r Normalized circumference: 3/4 < C/λ < 4/3;
r Spacing: s ≈λ/4;
r Pitch angle: 12◦≤α = tan−1(s/C) ≤150;
r Number of turns: n > 3.
In contrast to the normal mode helix, which has a current almost uniform in phase over the
antenna, the phase of the axial mode helix current shifts continuously along the helix like a
traveling wave. Because the circumference is about one wavelength, the currents at opposite
points on a turn are about 180degrees out of phase. This cancels out the current direction
reversal introduced by the half turn. Thus, the radiation from opposite points on the helix is
nearly in phase. This is essentially the same as the one-wavelength loop shown in Figure 5.12.
It is therefore not surprising to have the maximum radiation along the axis.
The radiation pattern of the axial mode helix can be modeled using antenna array theory,
to be discussed later in this chapter. Basically, each turn can be considered an element of the
array with a radiation pattern of cos θ. The normalized total radiation pattern is:
E = A cos θ sin [(n/2)]
sin [/2]
(5.25)
where the ﬁrst term is the normalization factor: A = 1/n for ordinary end-ﬁre radiation and
A = sin(π/(2n)) for Hansen–Woodyard (HW) end-ﬁre radiation (the axial mode helix was
found to approximately satisfy the Hansen–Woodyard condition, to be discussed in Section
5.3.2), which is larger than 1/n to reﬂect the increased directivity – it is achieved by increasing
the phase change between element sources. The second term in the equation (cos θ) is the
element radiation pattern and the last term represents the array factor of a uniform array of n
elements.  = β(s cos θ −L/p) and p is the relative phase velocity given by [2, 4]

Using the link between the directivity and HPBW in Equation (4.14), we obtain the
directivity:
D ≈15C2ns/λ3
(5.29)
This is proportional to C2, n and s. Thus, the effects of n on directivity are signiﬁcant when
n is small but not signiﬁcant when n is large (for example, if n is increased from 2 to 4, the
directivity is doubled. If n is increased from 20 to 22, the increment is still 2, but the directivity
has little change). If we take the minor lobes and the details of the pattern shape into account,
a more realistic estimation is
D ≈12C2ns/λ3
(5.30)
The axial ratio is found to be
AR = (2n + 1)/(2n)
(5.31)
The input impedance of an axial mode helix with a ground, which is greater than one
wavelength, is almost resistive with values between 100 and 200 
. The estimated value
within 20% accuracy is expressed by
R = 140C/λ
(5.32)
A suitable matching circuit is required by the antenna if it is to be connected to a 50 
transmission line. One way to bring the input impedance down to the desired value is to use the
ﬁrst 1/4 turn as an impedance transformer. A microstrip is an ideal structure for this purpose,
since the ground plane may be the same as that of the antenna. The dielectric substrate height
h is linked to the strip width w and feed line characteristic impedance Z0 by [4]
h =

where εr is the relative permittivity of the substrate. This improved-matching modiﬁcation

pattern with a directivity of 13 dBi. Find out its input impedance, HPBW, AR and radiation
pattern.
Solution:
Using the recommended design parameters for an axial mode helix, we can choose: s =
λ/4 and C = λ, which gives us the pitch angle: 12◦≤α = tan−1(s/C) = 14.0362◦≤15◦.

The required directivity is
D = 13 dBi = 20 ≈12C2ns/λ3
thus, n = 6.667 ≈7 turns. Now we can use the equations above to obtain:

Both patterns (E1: dashed line for normal end-ﬁre array and E2: solid line for the helix)

directivity (by a factor of 1.115 or 0.918 dB in this case). The logarithmic presentation in the
rectangular plot shows more and clearer details of the radiation than that of the polar plot in
linear scale. It is also interesting to note that the increased directivity pattern E2 has a sharper
main beam but higher side lobe levels than that of the ordinary end-ﬁre pattern E1.

5.1.5 Yagi–Uda Antennas
The Yagi–Uda antenna (also known as a Yagi) is another popular type of end-ﬁre antenna
widely used in the VHF and UHF bands (30 MHz to 3 GHz) because of its simplicity, low cost
and relatively high gain. The most noticeable application is for home TV reception and these
can be found on the rooftops of houses. A typical one is shown in Figure 5.18.
Yagi and Uda were two Japanese professors who invented and studied this antenna in the
1920s. S. Uda made the ﬁrst Yagi–Uda antenna and published the results in Japanese in 1926
and 1927, and the design was further developed and published in English by his colleague
Professor Yagi a year later [10]. Since then a signiﬁcant of amount of work has been done
theoretically and experimentally. A lot of data and results are available in the public domain.
The main feature of this type of antenna is that it consists of three different elements: the
driven element, reﬂector and director, as shown in Figure 5.19. Some people consider the
Yagi–Uda antenna an array, since it has more than one element. However, it has just one

153
Figure 5.18

active element and feed port; all the other elements (the reﬂector and directors) are parasitic.
Thus, some people consider it an element antenna rather than an antenna array. The main
characteristics and design recommendations of these elements can be summarized as follows:
r The driven element (feeder): the very heart of the antenna. It determines the polarization
and central frequency of the antenna. For a dipole, the recommended length is about 0.47λ
to ensure a good input impedance to a 50 
 feed line.
r The reﬂector: normally slightly longer than the driven resonant element to force the radiated
energy towards the front. It exhibits an inductive reactance. It has been found that there is not
much improvement by adding more reﬂectors to the antenna, thus there is only one reﬂector.
The optimum spacing between the reﬂector and the driven element is between 0.15 and 0.25
wavelengths. The length of the reﬂector has a large effect on the front-to-back ratio and
antenna input impedance.
r The directors: usually 10 to 20% shorter than the resonant driven element and appear
to direct the radiation towards the front. They are of capacitive reactance. The director to

154
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
director spacing is typically 0.25 to 0.35 wavelengths, with larger spacing for longer arrays
and smaller spacing for shorter arrays. The number of directors determines the maximum
achievable directivity and gain.
5.1.5.1 Operational Principle
The special conﬁguration (long reﬂector and short directors) has made the Yagi–Uda antenna
radiate as an end-ﬁre antenna. The simplest three-element Yagi–Uda antenna (just one director)
already shows an acceptable end-ﬁre antenna pattern. The radiation towards the back seems to
be blocked/reﬂected by the longer element, but not just by the reﬂector; the reﬂector and director
produce push-and-pull effects on the radiation. Induced currents are generated on the parasitic
elements and form a traveling wave structure at the desired frequency. The performance is deter-
mined by the current distribution in each element and the phase velocity of the traveling wave.
5.1.5.2 Current Distribution
The current distribution on the driven element is determined by its length, frequency and
interaction/coupling with nearby elements (mainly the reﬂector and ﬁrst director), while the
current distribution in parasitic elements is governed by the boundary condition: the total
tangential electric ﬁeld must be zero on the conducting surface. This results in induced currents
and they may be viewed as the second sources of the radiation. Analytical and numerical
methods have been employed to obtain the current distribution along each element [2]. The
results show that the current distribution on each element is similar to that of a dipole. As
expected, the dominant current is on the driven element; the reﬂector and the ﬁrst director
carry less current, and the currents on other directors are further reduced and they appear to
be of similar amplitude, which is typically less than 40% of that of the driven element.
5.1.5.3 Radiation Pattern
Once the current is known, the total radiated ﬁeld can be obtained using Equation (4.3), which
may be difﬁcult and numerical computations may be required.
For a dipole Yagi–Uda antenna, the radiation from element n is given by Equation (5.4)
E(θ)n ≈jη Ine jβr
2πr
cos(βln cos θ) −cos(βln)
sin θ

(5.34)
where In is the maximum current and ln is half the length of the nth dipole. Thus, the total
radiation pattern is the ﬁeld superposition from all the elements and may be expressed as

where r is the center of the reﬂector to the observation point and spacing S0 = 0. It is apparent
that each element length and spacing, weighted by its maximum current, affects the total

155
radiation. This approach is the same as the one we are going to use for analyzing antenna
arrays later.
One important ﬁgure of merit in a Yagi–Uda antenna is the front-to-back ratio of the pattern.
It has been found that this is very sensitive to the spacing of the director. It varies from trough
to peak and from peak to trough repetitively as a function of the spacing [2].
5.1.5.4 Directivity and the Boom
The directivity can be obtained using Equation (4.11), as we did for dipoles. A simpler esti-
mation of the maximum directivity of a Yagi–Uda antenna is proposed by us as
D = 3.28N
(5.36)
The coefﬁcient 3.28 results from doubling the directivity (1.64) of a half-wave dipole. Since
there are N elements, the maximum is obtained when they are combined constructively as
3.28N. The reason for introducing the factor of 2 is that the radiation pattern is now uni-
directional end-ﬁre. The radiation is redirected to just half of the space by the reﬂector and
directors (very little to the other half), which is somewhat similar to the effect of a conducting
ground plane. For the simplest three-element Yagi–Uda antenna, N = 3, thus D = 9.84 =
9.93 dBi = 7.78 dBd. When the number is doubled to N = 6, 3 dB more gain can be obtained
(D = 12.93 dBi = 10.78 dBd). However, if three more directors are added to the antenna, the
improvement in the directivity is just 1.76 dB. Just like the helical antenna, the effect of the
number of elements on the directivity is signiﬁcant when N is small, but not signiﬁcant when
N is large.
There is a misperception on how the directivity is linked to the length of the boom. Some
people think the directivity is proportional to the length of the boom and not the number of
elements. The reality is that, as indicated by Equation (5.36), the number of properly placed
elements determines the directivity. Of course, the more elements, the longer the boom, and
hence the larger the directivity. But the point is that the directivity is determined by the number
of elements, not the length of the boom.
Some characteristics of the antenna may be affected by the boom if it is made of metal,
for example the input impedance. The boom should be insulated from the elements, otherwise
compensation is required. Since the orientation of the boom is orthogonal to the antenna
elements, the effects on the radiation pattern should be small.
5.1.5.5 Input Impedance
The input impedance is very sensitive to the spacing of the nearest two elements and their
lengths. As a rule of thumb, the closer the spacing, the smaller the input impedance. Coupling
reduces the impedance. If a half-wavelength dipole is used as the driven element, its impedance
can be reduced from 73 
 to as little as 12 
 when the spacing drops down to 0.1λ. This may
be a problem if the antenna is to be matched with a 50 
 or even a 75 
 transmission line.
A simple solution in practice is to replace a half-wavelength dipole by a folded dipole, which
has a typical impedance of 280 
.

5.1.5.6 Antenna Design
Generally speaking, Yagi–Uda antennas have low impedance and relatively narrow bandwidth
(a few percent). Improvement in both can be achieved at the expense of other parameters (such
as directivity and side lobes). The length and diameters of the elements as well as their re-
spective spacing determine the optimum characteristics. Since there are so many variables, the
optimum design of a Yagi–Uda antenna is a very complicated task. Extensive and comprehen-
sive experimental and theoretical investigations into Yagi–Uda antennas have been conducted.
The most well-known experimental study was conducted by Viezbicke at NBS (now NIST,
National Institute of Standards and Technology) [11]. He has produced a lot of data and results.
Some of these are summarized in Table 5.4, along with our estimated maximum directivity.
These data are extremely useful for practical antenna designs.
It should be pointed out that the element diameter is ﬁxed at 0.0085λ in Table 5.4. If this
condition cannot be met in reality, slight changes to the element length should be made and
relevant design curves for this purpose were produced in [11], with some reproduced in [2, 12].
These results were obtained experimentally. Analytical and numerical investigations have
shown that further improvements could be achieved. For example, Chen and Cheng [13, 14]
used a perturbational technique to vary each spacing and element length and showed that the
directivity of a six-element Yagi–Uda antenna was increased from the initial value (10.92 dBi)
to 12.89 dBi, which is very close to our estimated maximum directivity of 12.93 dBi.
Some optimization methods, such as genetic algorithm and particle swarm, have recently
been employed to optimize and miniaturize the design [15, 16, 17]; good and interesting results

The conﬁguration of a log-periodic antenna and its radiation pattern
have been obtained. It has been shown that optimum gains may be obtained with very small
spacings. This is a very attractive feature for modern mobile communication systems, where
size is particularly important.
In addition to the dipole, other antenna types (especially loops) have also been used to make
Yagi–Uda antennas for various applications.
5.1.6 Log-Periodic Antennas and Frequency-Independent Antennas
A very similar conﬁguration to the Yagi–Uda antenna is the log-periodic antenna, as shown in
Figure 5.20. It produces a similar end-ﬁre radiation pattern and directivity (typically between
7 and 15 dBi) to the Yagi–Uda and, also like the Yagi–Uda, is widely used in the VHF and
UHF bands. However, there are two major differences between them:
r Bandwidth: the log-periodic antenna has a much wider bandwidth than the Yagi–Uda.
r Feeder: each element of the log-periodic antenna is connected to the source and can be seen
as a feed of the antenna (i.e. each element is active) whilst there is only one feed (driven
element) and all the others are parasitic elements in the Yagi–Uda antenna.
5.1.6.1 Operational Principle of Log-Periodic Antennas
As seen in Figure 5.20, the log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) consists of many dipoles of
different lengths. The antenna is divided into the so-called active region and inactive regions.
The role of a speciﬁc dipole element is linked to the operating frequency: if its length, L, is
around half of the wavelength, it is an active dipole and within the active region; if its length is
greater than half the wavelength, it is in an inactive region and acts as a reﬂector; if its length
is smaller than half the wavelength, it is also in an inactive region but acts as a director, which
is very similar to the Yagi–Uda antenna. The difference is that the driven element shifts with
the frequency – this is why this antenna can offer a much wider bandwidth than the Yagi–
Uda. A traveling wave can also be formed in the antenna. The highest frequency is basically
determined by the shortest dipole length (L N) while the lowest frequency is determined by the
longest dipole length (L1).

158
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
The reason for this antenna being called a log-periodic antenna is that its input impedance
is a periodic function of the logarithm of the frequency. Other parameters that undergo similar
variations include the radiation pattern, directivity and beamwidth.
5.1.6.2 Antenna Design
The geometrical dimensions of the log-periodic antenna follow some pattern and condition,
which is another difference from the Yagi–Uda antenna. For analysis, the following notation
is used:
Ln = the length of element n, and n = 1, 2, . . . , N;
sn = the spacing between elements n and (n + 1);
dn = the diameter of element n;
gn = the gap between the poles of element n.
They are related to the scaling factor:
τ = L2
L1
= Ln+1
Ln
= sn+1
sn
= dn+1
dn
= gn+1
gn
< 1
(5.37)
and the spacing factor:
σ = s1
2L1
= sn
2Ln
< 1
(5.38)
As shown in Figure 5.20, two straight lines through the dipole ends form an angle 2α, which
is a characteristic of the frequency-independent structure. The angle α is called the apex angle
of the log-periodic antenna, which is a key design parameter and can be found as
α = tan−1


= tan−1
 Ln(1 −τ)
2sn

= tan−1
(1 −τ)
4σ

(5.39)
These relations hold true for any n. From the operational principle of the antenna and the
frequency point of view, Equation (5.37) corresponds to:
τ = Ln+1
Ln
=
fn
fn+1
(5.40)
Taking the logarithm of both sides, we have
log fn+1 = log fn −log τ
(5.41)
This means that the resonant frequency in log scale is increased by every |log τ|. Thus, the
performance of the antenna is periodic in a logarithmic fashion, hence the name log-periodic
antenna, as mentioned earlier.
This seems to have too many variables. In fact, there are only three independent variables
for the log-periodic antenna design. These three parameters, which can be chosen from the

directivity, length of the antenna, apex angle, the upper frequency and the lower frequency,
should come with the design speciﬁcations. Extensive investigations have been conducted
and some optimum designs have been obtained. The most noticeable work was carried out
by Carrel [18] and a correction was later made by Butson and Thompson in [19]. Computed
contours of constant directivity (gain) versus σ and τ were given in these references and
[2, 3, 12] (but some references have not incorporated the correction from [19]). A summary of
the optimum design data (with correction) is produced in Table 5.5, which can be used to aid
antenna design. It is apparent that, the higher the directivity, the larger the scaling factor and
spacing factor, but the smaller the apex angle.
Another important aspect of the design is the antenna input impedance, which can be tuned
by changing the diameter d of the element and the feeding gap gbetween the two poles.
g = d cosh (Z0/120)
(5.42)
where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the feed line to be connected (the desired
impedance). More details can be found in [2, 18].
In practice, the most likely scenario is that the frequency range is given from fmin to fmax;
the following equations may be employed for design:

and

(5.44)
Another parameter (such as the directivity or the length of the antenna) is required to produce
an optimized design.
Once the geometrical dimensions are obtained, it is desirable to ﬁnd the radiation pattern.
Unfortunately, there is no analytical solution; the best approach is to use some numerical
methods or software to complete this task. More discussion on this subject will be presented
in the next chapter.

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Example 5.3: Log-periodic antenna design. Design a log-periodic dipole antenna to cover all
UHF TV channels, which is from 470 MHz for channel 14 to 890 MHz for channel 83. Each
channel has a bandwidth of 6 MHz. The desired directivity is 8 dBi.
Solution:
The given three parameters are: fmin = 470 MHz, fmax = 890 MHz, and D = 8 dBi.
Since the desired directivity is 8 dBi, from Table 5.5, we can see that, for the optimum design,
the scaling factor τ = 0.865, the spacing factor σ = 0.157, and the apex angle α = 12.13◦.
The latter can also be obtained using Equation (5.39).
Because the frequency range is known, using Equation (5.44) yields
N = log
 f min

 
log(τ) + 1 = log
470
890
 
log(0.865) + 1 = 4.40 + 1 = 5.40 ≈6
That means at least six elements are required. To be on the safe side we should use seven or
even eight elements to be sure the desired directivity will be achieved.
If N = 8, we can afford to start from a lower frequency, say 400 MHz, thus
L1 =
c
fmin
= 300
400 = 0.75 (m),
and L2 = τ L1 = 0.865 ∗0.75 = 0.6487(m),. . . , L8 = 0.2718 <
c
fmax
= 300
890 = 0.3371(m).
The spacing can be obtained using (5.38), that is
sn = 2Lnσ = 0.314Ln
n = 1 to 7. (s1 = 0.2355; . . . , s7 = 0.0986)
The total length of the antenna is
L =
7

n
sn = 1.1142 (m)
this seems to be a reasonable length in real life.
In theory, the dipole diameter and feed gap at an element should also be scaled, as indicated
in Equation (5.37). But in practice, this is sometimes hard to achieve. Because these two
parameters do not affect the radiation pattern or directivity, we may just use the same or a
few different metal poles/tubes to make the antenna. The gap is linked to how each element
is fed and Equation (5.42) may be used to tune the impedance. It is not uncommon to use a
constant gap, which means a matching section/circuit may be required if the antenna is not
well matched with the feed line.
It should be pointed out that for the same number of elements, the Yagi–Uda antenna can
produce a higher directivity than its log-periodic counterpart. For example, in Example 5.3,
a six-element LPDA can offer 8 dBi gain, but a six-element Yagi–Uda antenna can achieve a
gain of more than 12 dBi. This is due to the fact that the Yagi–Uda is a narrowband antenna and
all elements are designed to contribute to the radiation constructively at the desired frequency,

Popular Antennas
161
while the log-periodic antenna is a broadband antenna and elements within the inactive regions
may not contribute to a speciﬁc frequency as efﬁciently and constructively as in a Yagi–Uda
antenna. There is a trade-off between the directivity and bandwidth for ﬁxed N. Question 5.10
will reinforce this concept.
In addition to the log-periodic dipole antenna, there are other forms of log-periodic antennas,
such as log-periodic loop antennas. The operation and design principle is the same.
5.1.6.3 Frequency-Independent Antennas
If the characteristics (such as the impedance and radiation pattern) of an antenna are not
a function of frequency, the antenna is called a frequency-independent antenna. There are
basically three methods for constructing such an antenna.
Scaling
If the antenna structure is built with a scaling factor τ, like the log-periodic antenna, its
properties will be the same at f and τf. By making the scaling factor close to 1, the properties
of the antenna at any frequency will be the same. In practice, even with τ not very close to 1,
good frequency-independent characteristics are observed. The LPDA is a good example.
Angle Conditions
If the antenna shape is speciﬁed only in terms of angle, the impedance and pattern properties
of the antenna will be frequency independent. Typical examples include various (wire, conical
and planar) spiral antennas, as shown in Figure 5.21 [2, 3, 4, 12]. Mathematically, the equation
for a logarithmic wire spiral can be expressed as
r = r0aφ
(5.45)
where
r = radial distance to a point on the spiral;
r0 = the radius for φ = 0, determining the upper frequency bound;
φ = angle with respect to thex-axis;
a = a constant controlling the ﬂaring rate of the spiral. When a > 1, it is right-handed,
while when 0 < a < 1, it is left-handed.

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
A second wire spiral, which is identical in form to the ﬁrst one with a rotation of π (now
φ ≥π), can be generated by
r = r0aφ−π
(5.46)
These two spirals form a circularly polarized frequency-independent antenna. The
impedance, pattern and polarization remain nearly constant over a wide range of frequen-
cies. The typical value of the expansion ratio a2π (the radius increase over one turn of the
spiral) is 4. Experimental results suggest that a spiral of one and a half turns is about the opti-
mum. Since the lower frequency bound is determined by the maximum radius, the bandwidth
of a typical spiral is r0a3π : r0 ≈8 : 1.
The input impedance is determined by the geometrical dimensions, especially around the
antenna feeding. A typical value is between 120 and 180 
.
The radiation pattern is bidirectional with two wide beams broadside to the plane of the
spiral, which is approximately cosθ when the z-axis is normal to the plane of the antenna.
Self-complementary
If an antenna structure is identical to its complementary structure, its input impedance is
frequency independent. This will be proved later in this chapter using Babinet’s principle: the
productoftheinputimpedancesoftheoriginalandthecomplementarystructuresisaconstant=
η2/4 (η ≈377 
 in free space). The impedances for both structures without truncation should
be identical, thus the input impedance is η/2 (≈188 
 in free space). Two examples are shown
in Figure 5.22.

In theory, these frequency-independent antennas should be inﬁnitely large to cover the whole
spectrum. In reality, the size has to be ﬁnite and therefore they have to be truncated to cover just
the desired frequency range. The truncation has to be done carefully in order to minimize the
effects on antenna performance. This means that the current has to be attenuated and negligible
at the point of truncation – this is why the tail of a planar spiral antenna has a tapered truncation,
as shown in Figure 5.22(a).
5.2 Aperture-Type Antennas
There is another group of antennas that are not made of metal wires but plates to form certain
conﬁgurations that radiate/receive EM energy in an efﬁcient and desired manner – the aperture-
type antennas. They are often used for higher frequency applications than wire-type antennas.
Typical examples include horn antennas and reﬂector antennas, as shown in Figure 5.23, which
will be discussed in this section. Although we can still make use of the conventional approach
to analyze this type of antenna, i.e. to obtain the current distribution ﬁrst and then calculate the
radiated ﬁeld and input impedance, a new method, which is particularly suitable for analyzing
aperture-type antennas, will be introduced in this section.
5.2.1 Fourier Transforms and the Radiated Field
It is well known that the Fourier transform is a very useful tool to convert a signal from the
time domain, x(t), to the frequency domain, X( f ). The mathematical expression is

Radiation from an aperture source in the z = 0 plane
Now let us deal with the radiation from an aperture source Sa located in the z = 0 plane. As
shown in Figure 5.24, it is assumed that the electric ﬁeld on this aperture is known as Ea (x, y).
We need to ﬁnd out the radiated ﬁeld in the half space z > 0.
This is a two-dimensional problem. We can employ the Fourier transform to obtain the
radiation in the far ﬁeld – this is normally a more efﬁcient and effective method than the
conventional current distribution approach, which uses the current distribution to characterize
the antenna. Thus, the two-dimensional Fourier transform will be used to solve this problem.
It has been shown that the radiated ﬁeld from such an aperture source is linked to a plane
wave with vector amplitude A propagating in the direction of the propagation vector k by the
following expression:
E(x, y, z) =

(5.48)
where
k · r = (kx ˆx + ky ˆy + kzˆz) · (x + y + z) = kxx + ky y + kzz;
kx, ky, kz are propagation constants along the x, y and z directions, respectively; they are linked
to the wave number β = 2π
λ =

kx 2 + ky2 + kz2, and
kx = β sin θ cos φ; ky = β sin θ sin φ; kz = β cos θ

A(kx, ky) = At(kx, ky) + Az(kx, ky)ˆz;
Az(kx, ky) = −k · At(kx, ky)

and
At(kx, ky) = Ax(kx, ky)ˆx + Ay(kx, ky)ˆy =

Ea(x, y)e j(kx x+ky y)dxdy

This is the Fourier transform of the aperture ﬁeld. Thus, Equation (5.48) means that the radiated
ﬁeld E can be obtained using the Fourier transform of the aperture ﬁeld. The calculation may
be complicated since double integrals are involved.

In the far ﬁeld, there is no ﬁeld component along the propagation direction, i.e. TEM waves.
Equation (5.48) can be much simpliﬁed to [1, 2]:


(5.51)
A coordinate transform from Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates has been made
here to simplify the expression of the ﬁeld, which is inversely proportional to the distance,
thus the radiated power is inversely proportional to the distance squared, which is the same as
the radiated ﬁeld from a short wire-type antenna. However, this radiated ﬁeld has two equally
importantcomponentsintheθ andφ directions–thisisnotthecaseformostwire-typeantennas.
The magnetic ﬁeld in the far ﬁeld (a local plane wave) is given by
H = ˆr × E/η
(5.52)
where η is the intrinsic impedance of the medium, as deﬁned previously.
Thus, once the source aperture ﬁeld distribution is known, the radiated ﬁelds can be obtained
using these equations. Other relevant characteristics (such as the directivity and HPBW) can
also be calculated using the formulas provided in Chapter 4. A summary of the characteristics
of a few rectangular aperture antennas is presented in Figure 5.25, which shows clearly how

the aperture ﬁeld distribution controls the radiation pattern. It is interesting to note that there is
a trade-off between the HPBW and the side-lobe level: the narrower the HPBW, the higher the
side-lobe level. It is also indicated that the maximum aperture efﬁciency occurs for a uniform
aperture distribution while the maximum beam efﬁciency (the ratio of the solid angle of the
main beam to the total beam solid angle) occurs for a highly tapered aperture distribution –
a compromise is normally one of the most important design aspects.
It can be shown that, for aperture-type antennas, the directivity can also be obtained using
the following formula, which is straightforward and powerful:

If the aperture distribution is of uniform amplitude, then this equation reduces to

(5.54)
where Ap is the physical aperture area of the antenna, which was used to ﬁnd the effective
aperture size and efﬁciency in Chapter 4. Using Equation (4.22), we know that, in this case, the
aperture efﬁciency is 100% and the directivity is the largest obtainable from such a physical
size. This shows that the larger the aperture, the larger the directivity – this is a general
conclusion for aperture-type antennas.

the waveguide open end. The pattern in the H-plane is close to cosθ, while the pattern in

Again it is proportional to the aperture’s physical size (ab) and this result indicates that
the aperture efﬁciency is reduced to 81% compared with uniform excitation. Since the
waveguide size is small, the directivity is small. The only way to increase it is to ﬂare out
its ends into a horn. Figure 5.27 shows three different horns with increased directivity.

5.2.2 Horn Antennas
There is no doubt that horn antennas are the simplest and one of the most widely used forms
of microwave antenna – the antenna is nicely integrated with the feed line (waveguide) and
the performance can be controlled easily. They are mainly used for standard antenna gain and
ﬁeld measurements, feed elements for reﬂector antennas and microwave communications. The
horn can take many different forms: pyramidal horns (shown in Figure 5.27) and conical horns
are the most popular types – the former is most suitable for linear polarization and the latter
for circular polarization. Since the basic theory is covered in the previous section, the focus of
this section is on design and performance estimation.
5.2.2.1 Pyramidal Horns
The open-ended waveguide has a small directivity and broad beamwidth, as demonstrated
in Example 5.4. Thus, it is not suitable for most practical applications. The pyramidal horn
has therefore evolved from the open waveguide and it is ﬂared in both the E- and H-planes,
as shown in Figure 5.28, which results in narrow beamwidths in both principal planes. The
question is how to obtain the optimum design for a speciﬁed gain/directivity at a desired
operating frequency.
Ideally, the phase of the ﬁeld across the horn mouth should be constant in order to obtain
the desired pattern with minimized side lobes. This requires a very long horn. However, the
horn should be as short as possible for practical convenience. An optimum design is therefore
a compromise in which the difference in the path length along the edge, lE, and the center of
the horn, R2, is made about 0.25λ.
All dimensional parameters are shown in Figure 5.28. The directivity to be achieved is D
at the operational wavelength λ. The feed waveguide dimensions are of width a and height b.

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
To make such a pyramidal horn, we need to know three of the parameters (A, lH, R1 and RH)
in the H-plane and three of the parameters (B, lE, R2 and RE) in the E-plane. The objective of
the design is to determine these unknown dimensions.
In the H-plane, the dimensions are linked by

where t is the maximum phase deviation over the wavelength in the H-plane, i.e. t = (lH −

0.375 (but 0.25 for the E-plane) gives the optimum design [2, 3, 12, 20], which means

When both the E- and H-planes are put together to form the pyramidal horn, the following
condition has to be satisﬁed in order to make it physically realizable and properly connected
to the feed waveguide:

We have eight independent equations (5.60a, 5.60b, 5.61, 5.63a, 5.63b, 5.64, 5.66 and 5.67)
to solve eight unknown variables in principle for the design problem to be resolved. Since most
of them are not linear equations, it is actually difﬁcult (if not impossible) to obtain a solution
analytically. After some mathematical manipulation, we can yield

This fourth-order equation in A can be solved using numerical methods. Alternatively, it may
also be attempted by trial and error. For the optimum design, use a ﬁrst guess approximation
[12, 20]:
A = 0.45λ
√
D
(5.71)
Once the value of A is obtained, we can easily calculate other dimensions of the structure.
The half-power beamwidth for an optimum horn in the H-plane is [12]
HPH = φH P ≈78◦λ
A
(5.72)
In the E-plane it is
HPE = θH P ≈54◦λ
B
(5.73)
These are approximate values; slightly different approximations are given in [4]. It is also
noted that the directivity obtained using these equations and Equation (4.14) is different from
that using Equation (5.67) unless ηap = 0.78 (it should be 0.51 for the optimized horn). This
may be due to the fact that Equation (4.14) is an approximation for a single-lobe antenna and
this one has side lobes.
Now we are going to use the following example to summarize the procedure of designing
an optimum pyramidal horn.
Example 5.5: Optimum horn design. Design a standard gain horn with a directivity of 20 dBi
at 10 GHz. A WR-90 waveguide will be used to feed the horn.

172
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Solution:
The directivity is D = 20 dBi = 100, wavelength λ = 30 mm and the dimensions of the
waveguide are a = 22.86 mm and b = 10.16 mm.
Step 1: Compute the dimension A from the design Equation (5.70).
As suggested above, the parameters for the optimum horns are:
ηap = 0.51; s = 0.25; t = 0.375
and the design Equation (5.70) becomes
A4 −22.86A3 + 214020A = 2.9581 × 108
Using Equation (5.71), we obtain an initial guessing value:
A = 0.45λ
√
D = 135 (mm)
and plot the function
Y(A) = A4 −22.86A3 + 21402A −2.9581 × 108
around A = 135 (mm). As seen in Figure 5.29, the actual solution is readily found as
A ≈133.96 (mm)
Step 2: Use Equation (5.69) to yield B
In this case B = 104.82 mm

Step 3: Find the remaining dimensions from:
Equation (5.61) or (5.62) for R1;
Equation (5.64) or (5.65) for R2;
Equation (5.60) for lH and RH;
Equation (5.63) for lE and RE.
We get
R1 = 199.41mm;
R2 =183.14 mm;
lH = 210.36 mm and RH = 165.38 mm;
lE = 190.49 mm and RE = 165.38 mm.
Step 4: Check if RH and RE are the same. If not, it means that the solution of A in Step 1 is
not accurate enough.
From the results in Step 3, we can see that RH and RE are identical, thus the design is very
good. However, if we used the guessing value A = 0.45λ
√
D = 135 (mm) as the solution,
it would give RH = 168.21 mm and RE = 162.73 mm. They are obviously different, which
means that the design needs to be revised.
As the TE10 mode is the ﬁeld pattern for such an antenna, the aperture ﬁeld distribution is
still the same as that of an open-ended waveguide (TE10 mode as well) but with a different
phase term, this is
Ea = ˆyE0 cos πx
A e−jβ/2(x2/R1+y2/R2), |x| ≤A
2 , and |y| ≤B
2
(5.74)
The radiation pattern is closely related to the phase error parameters s and t. There is no
simple expression for the pattern. Universal radiation patterns, as shown in Figure 5.30 where
a weighting factor (1 + cos θ)/2 is not included, have been produced for design purposes and
a detailed treatment of this subject can be found in [2]. The radiation pattern of this design is
shown in Figure 5.31. The side lobes in the E-plane are much higher than those in the H-plane –
a common feature of this type of antenna, since the aperture ﬁeld in the E-plane is uniform
(not tapered).

It should be pointed out that:
r The optimum horn is designed for a speciﬁc frequency and gain.
r For a horn of ﬁxed length, there is a maximum directivity/gain obtainable, which normally
corresponds to the optimum design. Under such a condition, the directivity is proportional
to the aperture size. Otherwise, this conclusion may not be valid. For example, a horn with
a larger aperture size than the optimal one has larger phase error parameters, which result in
smaller directivity.
r There are two special cases: in Figure 5.28, if A = a, the structure is called the E-plane
sectorial horn antenna; if B = b, the structure is called the H-plane sectorial horn antenna.
They are both shown in Figure 5.27. They have a very broad beamwidth in one of the principal
planes and a very narrow beamwidth in the other plane (the plane opened up). The design
procedure is the same as that for the pyramidal horn.
5.2.2.2 Other Horn Antennas
In addition to the pyramidal horn, there are many other horn antennas. The well-known ones
include:
r The circular horn: a simple circularly polarized antenna.

Popular Antennas
175
r The corrugated horn: this can provide reduced edge diffraction and cross polarization,
together with improved aperture efﬁciency (to 75–80%) and radiation pattern symmetry.
r The single- or double-ridged horn: a directional broadband antenna using a tapered ridge,
as shown in Figure 5.23.
Detailed discussion of these antennas can be found in references such as [3].
5.2.3 Reﬂector and Lens Antennas
The typical gain of a practical horn antenna is up to 20 dBi or so. Higher gains are obtainable,
but it means a much larger and heavier horn, which is not suitable for most applications. As
an alternative in practice, reﬂector and lens antennas can offer much higher gains than horn
antennas and are normally relatively easy to design and construct. They are probably the most
widely used antennas for high-frequency and high-gain applications in radio astronomy, radar,
microwave and millimeter wave communications and satellite tracking and communications.
Although reﬂector and lens antennas can take various geometrical conﬁgurations, the most
popular shape is the paraboloid – because of its excellent ability to produce a pencil beam
(high gain) with low side lobes and good cross-polarization characteristics in the radiation
pattern. The largest fully steerable reﬂector in the world is the 100 m diameter radio telescope
of the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy at Effelsberg in Germany, whereas the largest
reﬂector antenna is the 305 m radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory in the USA at the time
of writing. As displayed in Figure 5.32, the typical feed for such an antenna is a horn antenna,
which can be placed at the focal point in front of the reﬂector (front-fed) or at the back (vertex)
of the reﬂector (Cassegrain-fed). The latter is known as the Cassegrain reﬂector antenna and
was invented to avoid using a long feed line and to minimize the feed blockage problems of a
conventional paraboloidal antenna (the side lobes can be reduced as well). Due to its popularity,
the emphasis of this section will be on the paraboloidal reﬂector antenna. The design principles
can be applied to other reﬂector antenna designs. Many research and design papers have been
published in this area and some of the most referenced papers can be found in [21].

5.2.3.1 Paraboloidal Reﬂector Characteristics
AsFigure5.32shows,afront-fedparaboloidalantennaconsistsofareﬂectorandafeedantenna.
The surface of a paraboloidal reﬂector, which is illuminated by the feed antenna, is formed
by rotating a parabola about its axis. Its surface is therefore a paraboloid of revolution and
rays emanating from the focus of the reﬂector are transformed into plane waves – this means
that it is highly directional. If the reﬂector was extremely large (inﬁnite) and the feed was a
point source at the focal point having radiation only towards the paraboloid, all the radiated EM
energy would be directed in one direction (the z-direction in Figure 5.32) with zero beamwidth.
Here we have assumed that the radiated waves can be treated as rays (otherwise the conclusion
would not be valid), i.e. the structure is much greater than the wavelength. This unique feature
of the paraboloid has made it extremely suitable for high-frequency and high-gain applications.
5.2.3.2 Analysis and Design
In practice, it is not possible to make the reﬂector inﬁnitely large (actually we always try to
make it as small as possible) and truncation has to take place. Also, the feed antenna cannot be
a point source, which means that the actual performance of the antenna will be different from
the ideal one. Designing a good paraboloidal antenna is, in fact, a difﬁcult task.
Let us assume that the diameter of the reﬂector is 2a and the focal length is F. Any point
on this paraboloid must satisfy the following condition:
r =
2F
1 + cos θ = F sec2(θ/2)
θ ≤θ0
(5.75)
where the subtended/angular aperture angle θ0 (also known as the edge angle) is determined
by the reﬂector diameter and the focal length:
θ0 = tan−1

a
F −a2/(4F)

(5.76)
Here there are two parameters, diameter 2a and focal length F, to be decided, which does not
seem to be too bad. However, another element of the reﬂector antenna is the feed, which is an
antenna on its own and has many variables. Thus, the complete design of the reﬂector antenna
is actually a complex task since there are many parameters which could be changed to meet (or
fail) the speciﬁcations, some are independent and some are interlinked. The reﬂector design
problem consists primarily of matching the feed antenna pattern to the reﬂector. The usual goal
is to have the feed pattern about 10 dB down in the direction of the rim, that is the edge taper =
(the ﬁeld at the edge)/(the ﬁeld at the center) ≈10 dB. Feed antennas with this property can
be constructed for the commonly used F/2a value of 0.3 to 1.0. Higher values lead to better
cross-polarization performance, but require a narrower feed pattern and hence a physically
larger feed antenna.
The antenna analysis can be conducted using the Fourier-transform based aperture distribu-
tion method introduced in Section 5.1. Alternatively, the current distribution method commonly
used for wire-type antenna analysis and the equivalence principle can be employed to obtain
the equivalent source current at the aperture. Both methods yield results that are essentially
the same for the principal polarized radiation pattern and agree quite well with experimental
results as long as the aperture is large enough in terms of the wavelength. Detailed analysis can

be found in [21]. As a high-gain antenna, the most important parameter is obviously the direc-
tivity/gain. Thus, we are going to see how to estimate this parameter without using expensive
computer simulation tools.
Aperture Efﬁciency and Directivity
Since the feed antenna is closely linked to the reﬂector, the aperture efﬁciency should surely
reﬂect this linkage. Letg(θ) be the power radiation pattern of the feed located at the focus – it
is circularly symmetrical (not a function of φ). It has been shown that the aperture efﬁciency
is given as [2, 21]

(5.77)
As expected, this is determined by both the reﬂector and the feed. The maximum aperture
efﬁciency is around 82%, which is higher than that of a pyramidal horn.
The aperture efﬁciency is generally viewed as the product of the
1. Spillover efﬁciency: the fraction of the total power intercepted and collimated by the
reﬂector; it reduces the gain and increases the side-lobe levels.
2. Taper efﬁciency: the uniformity of the amplitude distribution of the feed pattern over the
surface of the reﬂector.
3. Phase efﬁciency: the phase uniformity of the ﬁeld over the aperture plane; it affects the
gain and side lobes.
4. Polarization efﬁciency: the polarization uniformity of the ﬁeld over the aperture plane.
5. Blockage efﬁciency: by the feed; it reduces gain and increases side-lobe levels. The support
structure can also contribute to the blockage.
6. Random error efﬁciency: over the reﬂector surface.
Some of these requirements contradict each other. For example, the larger the reﬂector angular
aperture angle θ0, the larger the spillover efﬁciency, but the smaller the taper efﬁciency. The
optimum aperture efﬁciency is the best trade-off from all aspects.
Once the aperture efﬁciency is found, the directivity can be readily obtained using Equation
(4.22):
D = 4π
λ2 ηap(πa2)
(5.78)
The analysis here has not taken the feed antenna efﬁciency into account, which is about 70–
80% if it is a horn antenna. Thus, the overall reﬂector efﬁciency factor is in the region of
50–70%. It is very common to make a reﬂector antenna with a gain of over 30 dBi. Some of the
world’s largest antennas have a gain over 70 or even 80 dBi, which is almost impossible for a
single wire-type antenna to achieve – remember the typical gain for a Yagi–Uda or log-periodic
antenna is about 10–15 dBi.
The HPBW can be estimated by the rule of thumb:
HPBW ≈70◦λ
2a
(5.79)

178
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
The beamwidth also depends on the edge illumination. Typically, as the edge attenuation
increases, the beamwidth widens and the side lobes decrease.
Design Considerations and Procedures
In addition to the aperture efﬁciency and directivity/gain, cross-polarization, phase errors (the
maximum fractional reduction in directivity is δ2(1 −δ2/4), where δ is the phase error), HPBW
(which can be estimated using Equation (4.14) once the directivity is known) and side lobes
must also be considered in design. The priority is really down to the speciﬁc application.
The design procedure starts with selection of the feed antenna, which determines the antenna
polarization and the reﬂector F and 2a. As mentioned earlier, the usual goal is to let the feed
pattern be about 10 dB down in the direction of the reﬂector rim. The feed and reﬂector
are interlinked; an iterative process may be required to ensure that the feed antenna pattern
is well matched with the reﬂector. Once the feed pattern and the reﬂector are known, the
radiated ﬁeld can be calculated, where complex integrations are involved [2, 21]. Normally,
computer software is required to accomplish such a task. For example, the software package
GRASP, a product of TICRA, is well suited for this application. This package is a set of tools
for analyzing reﬂector antennas and antenna farms. The program is based on PO (physical
optics)/GTD (geometrical theory of diffraction) calculation. More about software for antenna
designs will be given in Chapter 6.
Example 5.6: Edge taper and spillover efﬁciency. A circular parabolic reﬂector has F/2a =
0.5. The ﬁeld pattern of the feed antenna is E(θ) = cos θ, θ < π/2. Find the edge taper,

|A(θ)| = cos(θ)(1 + cos θ)

The edge taper is therefore:

A(0) = cos(θ0)(1 + cos(θ0))

This means a trough at the center (θ = 0), which is hard to achieve in practice.
5.2.3.3 Offset Parabolic Reﬂectors
To eliminate some of the deﬁciencies of symmetrical conﬁgurations, the offset parabolic reﬂec-
tor design has been developed for single- and dual-reﬂector systems, which reduces aperture
blockage and offers the advantage of allowing the use of a larger F/(2a) ratio while maintain-
ing acceptable structure rigidity. The conﬁguration is also widely employed, most noticeably
for domestic satellite receiving antennas, which have a typical gain of about 30 dBi. It is also
utilized in radar and other applications.
Figure 5.33 is an example of an offset parabolic reﬂector used for a radar positioning
application where the HPBW is required to be very narrow in the horizontal plane but wider in

the vertical plane. GRASP was employed to predict the performance. The simulated radiation
patterns are shown in Figure 5.34 and the main speciﬁcations for the H-plane are:
r the gain:
28.0 dB (27.9 dB, measured)
r the half-power beamwidth:
4.0 degrees (4.4 degrees)
r the 10 dB beamwidth:
6.8 degrees (7.6 degrees)
r the 1st side-lobe level:
−19.5 dB (−26.3 dB)
Measured results are given in the brackets. It is apparent that the simulated results are very
close to the measured ones (except for the side lobes in the H-plane). This indicates that our
simulation and design tool worked well for this antenna.
Some other reﬂector antennas, such as ﬂat sheet reﬂector antennas and corner reﬂectors, are
also used in practice.
5.2.3.4 Lens Antennas
Just like reﬂector antennas, lens antennas can also convert a spherical wave into a plane wave
to produce high gains and pencil beams. They are only suitable for high-frequency (> 4
GHz) applications. There are basically two types, as shown in 5.35: delay lenses, in which
the electrical path length is increased by the lens medium (using low-loss dielectrics with
a relative permittivity greater than one, such as Lucite or polystyrene), and fast lenses, in
which the electrical path length is decreased by the lens medium (using metallic or artiﬁcial
dielectrics with a relative permittivity smaller than one). The source or primary antenna is
normally a tapered horn antenna as for a reﬂector antenna. Lens antennas have very similar
characteristics to the paraboloidal reﬂector antennas discussed earlier in this section. But they
do offer several advantages over reﬂector antennas, which make them more attractive for some
aerospace applications such as Earth observation and radars. These advantages include wide-
angle scan, very low side lobes and low feed horn blockage. A very good discussion on lens
antennas can be found in [4].
5.2.4 Slot Antennas and Babinet’s Principle
Slot antennas can be considered a very special group of aperture-type antennas. They are very
low-proﬁle and can be conformed to basically any conﬁguration, thus they have found many
applications, for example on aircraft and missiles. They may be conveniently energized with
a coaxial transmission line or a waveguide, as Figure 5.36 shows. The open-end waveguide
analyzed in Example 5.4 may be viewed as a slot antenna if a ground plane is used. The aperture
distribution method can be employed again to yield the radiated ﬁelds. For narrow slots, there
is another way to do it: we are going to use the equivalence principle to obtain the radiation
characteristic. This is simple and convenient and the knowledge gained for wire-type antennas
can be readily applied to this case.
Recall the equivalence principle introduced in Chapter 3, the radiated ﬁeld by the slot is the
same as the ﬁeld radiated by its equivalent surface electric current and magnetic current, which

were given by Equation (3.37), that is
JS = ˆn × H, MS = −ˆn × E
where E and H are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds within the slot and ˆn is the unit vector
normal to the slot surface S.
Take a half-wavelength slot as an example. Since its equivalent electric surface current
JS = ˆn × H = 0, the remaining source at the slot is its equivalent magnetic current MS = −
ˆn × E (it would be 2MS if the conducting ground plane were removed using the imaging
theory). This is the same kind of equivalent magnetic source as a loop, as discussed in Section
5.1.3. The current distribution along this half-wavelength magnetic source is the same as the
current distribution along a half-wavelength dipole. We can therefore use the duality principle
introduced in Section 5.1.3 to ﬁnd the radiated ﬁeld of the slot from the dipole ﬁeld.
The normalized electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a half-wavelength dipole can be obtained
using Equations (5.3) and (5.4) as

Using the duality relation in Table 5.3, we obtain the normalized radiated ﬁeld from a
half-wavelength slot antenna as
Eφ = cos [π/2 cos θ]
sin θ
, and H θ = cos [π/2 cos θ]
sin θ
(5.82)
Thus, the only change in the ﬁeld from dipole to slot is that Eθ is replaced by Eφ, and Hφ is
replaced by Hθ. The radiation pattern shape is not changed, as seen in Figure 5.37. Of course,
if the slot antenna only radiates to half of the space, then the radiation pattern should only
appear in half of the space.
Another very important parameter of the antenna is the input impedance. Again, if we utilize
another theory, Babinet’s principle, this parameter can also be obtained easily using our existing
knowledge. Babinet’s principle states that the ﬁeld at any point behind a plane having a screen,
if added to the ﬁeld at the same point when the complementary screen is substituted, is equal
to the ﬁeld at the point when no screen is present. Obviously it is meant for optics. If this
principle is extended to antennas and radio propagation and the equivalent transmission line
model is employed, as we did in Chapter 3 for radio wave transmission and reﬂection analysis,
we can get the following important relationship for the input impedances of complementary
antennas:
ZslotZdipole = η2
4
(5.83)
This means that the product of the impedances of two complementary antennas is the constant
η2/4 and this is the interpretation of Babinet’s principle in antennas.
Since the impedance for a half-wavelength dipole is about 73 ohms, the corresponding slot
has an impedance of

Slot antennas, especially slot waveguide antennas where the antenna and feed line are inte-
grated and exhibit high power-handling capacity, are often used to form an antenna array for
applications such as airborne radar. Figure 5.38 is such an example: 26 waveguides and over
300 slot elements are employed to form this antenna array. Each slot is carefully designed to
ensure that the ﬁeld aperture distribution follows a Gaussian distribution, as shown in Figure
5.25. It has a very high gain (over 35 dBi) and low side lobes (below −25 dB). More will be
presented on antenna arrays in Section 5.3.
5.2.5 Microstrip Antennas
A microstrip antenna, also known as a patch antenna, consists of a metal patch on a substrate
on a ground plane, as shown in Figure 5.39. Different feed conﬁgurations, including aperture-
coupled, microstrip line feed and coaxial feed, are also shown in the ﬁgure. The patch can take
various forms to meet different design requirements. Typical shapes are rectangular, square,
circular and circular ring. The microstrip antenna is low-proﬁle, conformable to planar and
nonplanar surfaces, simple and cheap to manufacture using modern printed-circuit technology,
compatible with MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuit) designs and mechanically
robust. In addition, it is very versatile in terms of resonant frequency, input impedance, radiation
pattern and polarization. All these have made it an extremely popular modern antenna for
frequencies above 300 MHz (from the UHF band). A huge number of research papers and many
books have been published over the years in this area [22–25]. The major disadvantages of this
type of antenna are: low efﬁciency (conducting, dielectric and especially surface wave losses),

low power-handling capability (not suitable for high-power applications), poor polarization
purity, and relatively narrow frequency bandwidth. However, signiﬁcant improvements in, for
example, broadening the bandwidth have been made (by stacking and other methods in order
to meet the demand from the booming wireless communications industry [25]). Considerable
attention has been paid recently to how to make this kind of antenna tunable and reconﬁgurable
by adding loads/switches on or between the patch and the ground plane. The future for this
antenna seems bright and exciting.
In this section a rectangular patch antenna is chosen as an example for investigation, since it
is the most popular printed antenna. We are going to examine the operational principles, major
characteristics and design procedures. As usual, a design example will be given at the end of
the section.
5.2.5.1 Operational Principles
The rectangular antenna dimensions and coordinates are displayed in Figure 5.39(a). Usually,
the patch length L is between λ0/3 and λ0/2 and its width W is smaller than λ0 (it cannot

186
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
be too small, otherwise the antenna becomes a microstrip line, which is not a radiator) while
its thickness t is extremely small. The substrate of thickness d (≪λ0) uses the same kind of
materials as listed in Table 2.4. Their relative permittivity is normally between 2 and 24.
To be a resonant antenna, the length L should be around half of the wavelength. In this
case, the antenna can be considered a λ/2 transmission line resonant cavity with two open ends
where the fringing ﬁelds from the patch to the ground are exposed to the upper half space
(z > 0) and are responsible for the radiation. This radiation mechanism is the same as the slot
line, thus there are two radiating slots on a patch antenna, as indicated in Figure 5.39(a). This
is why the microstrip antenna can be considered an aperture-type antenna.
The fringing ﬁelds at the ends are separated by λ/2, which means that they are 180 degrees
out of phase but are equal in magnitude. Viewed from the top of the antenna, both ﬁelds are
actually in phase for the x components, which leads to a broadside radiation with a maximum
in the z direction.
5.2.5.2 Analysis and Design
As a resonant cavity, there are many possible modes (like waveguides), thus a patch antenna
is multimode and may have many resonant frequencies. The fundamental and dominant mode
is TM100 (a half wave change along the x-axis and no changes along the other two axes).
Radiation Pattern and Directivity
The radiation comes from the fringing ﬁelds at the two open ends, as discussed above, which
is equivalent to two slot antennas separated by a distance L. It can be proved that the far-ﬁeld
electric ﬁeld can be expressed as:
E = E0 sin c
βW
2
sin θ sin φ

cos
βL
2 sin θ cos φ

(ˆθ cos φ −ˆφ cos θ sin φ)
(5.85)
where β is the free space wave number. The ﬁrst factor is the pattern factor for a uniform line
source of width W in the y direction (similar to Example 5.4) and the second factor is the array
factor for the two-element slots separated by L in the x direction (to be discussed in the next
section). For both components, the peak is at θ = 0, which corresponds to the z direction. It
has a broadside unidirectional pattern.

Figure 5.40
Typical radiation patterns of a resonant rectangular patch antenna
These results have neglected the substrate effects and slot width, but are good enough as
estimates. The typical radiation patterns in the E- and H-planes are shown in Figure 5.40. As
discussed in Section 5.1.2, if the ground plane is ﬁnite, leaky radiation towards the lower half
space will occur.
With the radiated ﬁeld, we are able to compute the directivity using Equation (4.11). Asymp-
totically, the directivity of the microstrip antenna can be expressed as
D =
6.6 = 8.2 dBi,
W ≪λ0
8W/λ0,
W ≫λ0
(5.88)
The larger the width, the larger the directivity. These are approximations as well; the actual
directivities are slightly lower than these values.
Input Impedance and Bandwidth
According to Equation (40) of [23], the typical impedance at the edge of a resonant rectangular
patch ranges from 100 to 400 
, the radiation impedance of a patch at the edge can be
approximated as
Za ≈90
ε2

εr −1
 L

2
(

(5.89)
Here the radiation efﬁciency (a function of the thickness) is assumed to be 100%. Thus, the
impedance is determined by three parameters. For a PTFE (Teﬂon) based substrate with a
relative permittivity of 2.1, to obtain a 50 
 input impedance we need (L/W) = 0.3723. Since
L = 0.49λ, we have W = 1.316λ.

fractional bandwidth for VSWR < 2 [23]:

Thus, the bandwidth is proportional to the thickness of the substrate. This also indicates that
the higher the permittivity, the smaller the bandwidth, which means there is a trade-off between
the size (Ld/W) and bandwidth.
Design Equations and Procedures
Because of the fringing effects, electrically the patch of the antenna looks larger than its
physical dimensions; the enlargement on L is given by [2]
L = 0.412d(εreff + 0.3)(W/d + 0.264)/[(εreff −0.258)(W/d + 0.8)]
(5.91)
Where the effective (relative) permittivity is
εreff = εr + 1
2
+
εr −1
2√1 + 12d/W
(5.92)
This is related to the ratio of d/W. The larger the d/W, the smaller the effective permittivity.
The effective length of the patch is now
Leff = L + 2L
(5.93)
The resonant frequency for the TM100 mode is

(5.95)
Now the design problem: if the substrate parameters (εr and d) and the operational frequency
( fr) are known, how can we obtain the dimensions of the patch antenna (W and L)?
Based on these simpliﬁed formulas, we can adopt the following design procedure to design
the antenna:
Step 1: Use Equation (5.95) to ﬁnd the width W.
Step 2: Calculate the effective permittivity εreff using Equation (5.92).
Step 3: Compute the extension of the length L using Equation (5.91).

Thus, the designed patch should have L = 40.49 mm and W = 48.40 mm.

The solution is Wm = 4.367 mm. The ﬁnal design is shown in Figure 5.41.
Since the width of the quarter-wave transformer might be too thin to make properly in
practice, an alternative design is to employ an inset feed, as shown in Figure 5.39(a) and
use the following design equation [2, 24, 26]:

The bandwidth is indeed very narrow. Some alternative patch antennas are displayed in
Figure 5.42. Generally speaking, they can offer broader bandwidth than a rectangular patch.
5.2.5.3 Ground Plane
The ground plane is part of the antenna. Ideally, the ground plane should be inﬁnite as for
a monopole antenna. But, in reality, a small ground plane is desirable. As shown in Figure
5.39(a), the radiation of a microstrip antenna is generated by the fringing ﬁeld between the
patch and the ground plane, the minimum size of the ground plane is therefore related to the
thickness of the dielectric substrate. Generally speaking, a λ/4 extension from the edge of
the patch is required for the ground plane, whereas the radius of a monopole ground plane
should be at least one wavelength.
5.3 Antenna Arrays
So far we have studied many different antennas: wire types and aperture types; resonant an-
tennas (such as dipole and patch antennas) and traveling wave antennas (such as Yagi–Uda
and periodic antennas). They can all be classiﬁed as single-element antennas. Once the fre-
quency is given, everything (the radiation pattern, input impedance, etc.) is ﬁxed. They lack
ﬂexibility and the gain is normally very limited. A high-gain antenna means that the aperture
size of the antenna has to be very large, which may be a problem in practice. Also, sometimes
we need to be able to control the antenna radiation pattern, for example for tracking or anti-
jamming/interference applications. A single-element antenna is not good enough to meet such
a requirement. In this case, an antenna array could be a good solution.
An antenna array consists of more than one antenna element and these radiating elements are
strategically placed in space to form an array with desired characteristics, which are achieved
by varying the feed (amplitude and phase) and relative position of each radiating element. The
total radiated ﬁeld is determined by vector addition of the ﬁelds radiated by the individual

192
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
elements. The total dimensions of the antenna are enlarged without increasing the size of the
individual element. The major advantages of an array are:
r the ﬂexibility to form a desired radiation pattern;
r the high directivity and gain;
r the ability to provide an electrically scanned beam (mechanical rotation can be avoided).
The main drawbacks are:
r the complexity of the feeding network required;
r the bandwidth limitation (mainly due to the feeding network).
In this section we are going to examine the basic operational principle of an antenna array and
its associated theory, how to design an array and what the problems and trade-offs are.
5.3.1 Basic Concept
Let us assume that there are N elements in an antenna array, as shown in Figure 5.43. The
phase and amplitude of each element can be tuned electrically or mechanically using phase
shifters and attenuators. Sometimes, these weighting factors are already integrated into the
radiating elements and no tuning is required.
The total radiated ﬁeld can be obtained by summing up the radiated ﬁeld from each element
antenna, i.e.
E(r, θ, φ) =
N

n=1
En(J n)
(5.98)
Each element has many variables, including the element antenna itself and its excitation (am-
plitude and phase); the overall arrangement of these elements is another variable which can be

in many different geometrical forms to achieve the desired radiation characteristics. In practice,
all the elements are placed in a speciﬁc conﬁguration to form a well-controlled 1D, 2D or even
3D array (which may be linear, circular, rectangular or elliptical in shape). Arbitrary shaped
arrays are not well studied and the patterns are not easy to control, thus they are not used.
5.3.2 Isotropic Linear Arrays
Now we are going to use a linear array, the most popular array arrangement, as an example to
explore the features of an antenna array. To simplify the analysis, the radiator is assumed to be
an isotropic element but its amplitude and phase are controllable. Since the isotropic element
means that its radiation is the same in every direction, from Equation (4.6), we know that the
far-ﬁeld radiation from such an isotropic element can be expressed as
Eie = e−jβr
4πr
(5.99)
The polarization is not shown here but the ﬁeld is orthogonal to the propagation direction.
Thus, the total radiated ﬁeld from an isotropic linear array of N elements can be written as
Eia =

where An is the amplitude and ϕn is the relative phase (to a common reference, as shown in

factor, that is
AF =

(5.101)
If we further assume that the spacing between elements is a constant d and all the elements
have identical amplitude (say, 1) but each succeeding element has a ϕ0 progressive phase lead
current excitation relative to the preceding one, this array is referred to as a uniform array.
Using Figure 5.43, the array factor in this case is:
AF =

maximum at θ = 0◦is the main beam or main lobe. The other maxima are called grating lobes.
Generally, grating lobes are undesirable, because most applications such as radars require a
single, focused beam. The important messages from these plots and Equation 5.104 are:
r there are (N −2) side lobes between the main and ﬁrst grating lobes (not applicable for
small d, to be discussed in Figure 5.47);
r grating lobes appear if d ≥λ. To avoid any grating lobes, the largest separation between the
element should be less than one wavelength;
r the notches between lobes are nulls (in theory);
r the ﬁrst side lobe is about −13 dB, the same as for uniform aperture antennas;
5.3.2.1 Phased Arrays
From Equation (5.104), we know that the maximum of the radiation occurs at ψ = 0 which is

Normally, the spacing d is ﬁxed for an array; we can control the maximum radiation (or scan
the beam) by changing the phase ϕ0 and the wavelength (frequency) – this is the principle
of a phase/frequency scanned array. The phase change is accomplished electronically by the
use of ferrite (sensitive to magnetic ﬁeld) or diode (sensitive to bias voltage) phase shifters,
switched transmission lines are also commonly used. Controlling the beam is one of the most
appealing features of arrays. The pattern can be scanned electronically by adjusting the array
coefﬁcients (ϕ0 or λ). An example of the array pattern (AF) for N = 10, d = λ/2 and ϕ0 = 45◦
is shown in Figure 5.45. It is apparent that the maximum is now shifted from 0◦to another angle
(θ = −45◦/π ≈14.3◦). The angle is controlled by the phase shifter. This approach permits
beams to be moved from point to point in space in just microseconds, whereas mechanical
scanning of a large antenna could take several seconds or longer.
Phased antenna arrays (1D and 2D) are widely used, especially for military applications.
The beneﬁts are obvious, so are the difﬁculties at the feeding network. Just imagine the wiring
for an antenna array with hundreds of elements!
Due to the feasibility and variables within a phased array, it is also known as a smart antenna.

5.3.2.2 Broadside and End-ﬁre Arrays
An array is called a broadside array if the maximum radiation of the array is directed normal
to its axis (θ = 0◦in Figure 5.43); while it is called an end-ﬁre array if the maximum radiation
is directed along the axis of the array (θ = 90◦in Figure 5.43). For a given frequency, we can
control the spacing d and the progressive phase ϕ0 to make the array broadside or end-ﬁre.
The speciﬁc conditions are:
r broadside: ϕ0 = 0;
r end-ﬁre: ϕ0 = ±2πd/λ.
The major characteristics of the radiation pattern of both arrays are listed in Table 5.6. The
polar and rectangular plots of the radiation patterns of the broadside and end-ﬁre arrays for
d = λ/2 and λ/4 at N = 10 are shown in Figures 5.46 and 5.47, respectively.
It should be noted that from these results, for the same geometrical conﬁguration (length
and spacing),
r the HPBW of the end-ﬁre array is always larger than that of the broadside array, so is the
FNBW;
r the directivity of the end-ﬁre array, as given by Table 5.6, is twice that for the broadside array
if the spacing is much smaller than the wavelength.
These two conclusions seem to contradict the relation between the directivity and HPBW
shown in Equation (4.13). The reality is that broadside arrays can only produce a fan beam
(two symmetrical main lobes) while end-ﬁre arrays can generate a single pencil beam (just
one main lobe) when

Figure 5.47 (b) is an example to demonstrate this interesting feature, thus Equation (4.13)
cannot be applied.
It should also be pointed out that the number of side lobes for the broadside case is no longer
(N −2) when the spacing d becomes small, as shown in Figure 5.47(a). Some side lobes are
merged.
5.3.2.3 The Hansen–Woodyard End-ﬁre Array
Theend-ﬁrearraysdiscussedabove,whicharecalledordinaryend-ﬁrearrays,arenotoptimized
to produce the optimum directivity. It is possible to make the main beam narrower and thus
increase directivity by changing the inter-element phase shift. Hansen and Woodyard [28]
found that the maximum directivity of an end-ﬁre array is obtained when
ϕ0 = ±(2πd/λ + 2.92/N) ≈±(2πd/λ + π/N)
(5.108)
if the array length is much larger than a wavelength. However, it should be pointed out that
the condition in Equation (5.108) is not for the maximum possible directivity of any array
(which may occur at other directions rather than θ = ±90◦) but only for end-ﬁre arrays. The
directivity can now be approximated as
D ≈7.28 Nd
λ
(5.109)
This means an increase of 2.6 dB over the ordinary end-ﬁre array in directivity. This is why
the Hansen–Woodyard array is also known as the increased directivity end-ﬁre array. When
the axial mode helix was discussed in Section 5.1.4, it was concluded that this type of antenna
approximately satisﬁes the Hansen–Woodyard end-ﬁre condition and increased directivity was
obtained.

5.3.2.4 The Dolph–Tchebyscheff (D–T) Optimum Distribution
In addition to the directivity/gain, another very important consideration for antenna arrays is
the side-lobe level (SLL), since it affects antenna performance (such as the antenna temperature
and SNR). As mentioned earlier and shown in Figure 5.48, there is a trade-off between the
SLL and gain. To achieve a high gain, a uniform distribution is preferred but it results in a high
SLL (about −13 dB) while a well-tapered distribution can produce very low SLL or even no
side lobes (such as the binominal distribution) but it exhibits a lower gain. It is shown that the
far-ﬁeld pattern of a linear in-phase (ϕ0 = 0, broadside) array of isotropic point sources can be
expressed as a ﬁnite Fourier series of N terms. We can use Dolph’s procedure [29] to match
the Fourier polynomial with the terms of like degree of a Tchebyscheff polynomial. This then
yields the optimum source amplitude distribution for a speciﬁc SLL with all side lobes of the
same level. More details can be found in [4].

5.3.3 Pattern Multiplication Principle
In practice, isotropic sources will be replaced by practical antennas, which means that the
element radiated Eie in Equation (5.100) should be replaced by the radiated ﬁeld of the antenna
element Ee, thus the total radiated ﬁeld of the antenna array is
Ea = Ee
N

n=1
Ane jϕn = Ee · AF
(5.110)
This is actually called the principle of pattern multiplication. The radiation pattern of an array
is the product of the pattern of the individual element antenna with the (isotropic source) array
pattern.

Figure 5.48

distributions of eight in-phase isotropic sources spaced by λ/2. [Reproduced by Permission of The

Let us take a two-element short dipole array as an example. The elements are in phase
and separated by half a wavelength, the AF (isotropic array pattern) is therefore a ﬁgure 8 (in
shape) from Equation (5.104). Since the dipole radiation pattern is well known to us now and is
also a ﬁgure 8 in shape, the total radiation patterns for the horizontally oriented and vertically
oriented dipole arrays can be obtained using the pattern multiplication principle, as shown in
Figure 5.49.
Using the pattern multiplication principle, we can extend the knowledge and results obtained
for isotropic arrays to other antenna arrays. It is now also possible to produce a unidirectional
broadside radiation pattern by using directional antenna elements.
The product of the directivity of a single element and the directivity of the isotropic array
may be used to estimate the directivity of the antenna array, but the accuracy varies with the
array geometry [30].
5.3.4 Element Mutual Coupling
When antenna elements are placed in an array, they interact with each other. This interaction
between elements due to their close proximity is called mutual coupling, which affects the
current distribution and hence the input impedance as well as the radiation pattern.

The most signiﬁcant effects are on the antenna input impedance, which is a very important
parameter for a single antenna as well as for an antenna array. We can use circuit concepts,
which are simpler than ﬁeld concepts, to analyze the input impedance of element antennas in an
array. Each element antenna is considered a current source. An antenna array of N elements is
then treated as an N-port network, and the voltage generated at each element can be expressed
as
V1 = Z11I1 + Z12I2 + · · · + Z1N I N
V2 = Z21I1 + Z22I2 + · · · + Z2N I N
· · ·
VN = Z N1I1 + Z N2I2 + · · · + Z N N I N
(5.111)
where In is the current at the nth element and

, n = 1, 2, . . . N

is called the self-impedance of the nth element when all other elements are open-circuited, or
the input impedance when this element is isolated from the other elements (as if it were not in
an array). For a half-wavelength dipole, its self-impedance is about 73 ohms. The impedance
Zmn = Vm
In
(5.113)
is called the mutual impedance between the elements m and n(Zmn = Znm by the reciprocity
principle to be discussed later). Again, using two half-wavelength dipole antennas as an ex-
ample, the mutual impedance (resistance and reactance) of two parallel side-by-side dipoles
is shown in Figure 5.50, while the mutual impedance of two collinear dipoles as a function of

the separation between them is plotted in Figure 5.51. Examining these results reveals that:
r the strength of the coupling decreases as spacing increases;
r the parallel conﬁguration couples more than the collinear conﬁguration;
r the far-ﬁeld pattern of each element predicts coupling strength. The more radiation, the
stronger the coupling.

This is the actual input impedance of the element and is also referred to as the active impedance.
It should be pointed out that the elements at the array edges have fewer neighbouring ele-
ments, thus the mutual coupling could vary signiﬁcantly from edge elements to other elements.
5.3.4.1 Discussions
In addition to 1D arrays, 2D antenna arrays have also been developed for practical applications.
The slot waveguide array in Figure 5.38 is an example where each element (slot) is carefully
designed to ensure the aperture ﬁeld distribution on the antenna follows the desired pattern
(such as a Gaussian distribution) and the impedance (including mutual impedance) is matched
with the waveguide. Here discrete antenna elements are employed to form a continuous aperture
ﬁeld distribution. It is evident that antenna arrays are closely linked to aperture antennas. Some
theories developed for aperture antennas may be applied to antenna arrays.
The array feeding network can be very complicated, thus it is a special topic. Generally
speaking, just like elements in an electric circuit, the antenna elements in an array may be
fed by a parallel circuit, a series circuit or a combination of both. But care has to be taken;
the feeding network is normally a distributed system at high frequencies. The network may

limit the bandwidth of the antenna system and may actually act as a radiator if not properly
designed!
5.4 Some Practical Considerations
Up to now, we have covered the most popular antennas: wire-type and aperture-type antennas,
element and array antennas. You should have gained a good understanding of their operational
principles, major ﬁeld and circuit characteristics and design procedures. However, there are
many practical considerations we have not yet studied, and it is not possible to deal with all
aspects of antenna design and characterization in this book. In this section we are going to
look at some important considerations in practice, which include:
r the differences between transmitting and receiving antennas;
r antenna feeding and matching;
r polarization;
r radomes, housings and supporting structures.
5.4.1 Transmitting and Receiving Antennas: Reciprocity
So far we have not distinguished between antennas for transmitting and receiving purposes.
Are there any differences between them? The short answer is yes and no, depending on what
parameters you are talking about. Let us examine these two cases from both the ﬁeld point of
view and the circuit point of view.
Let us assume within a linear and isotropic medium that there exist two sets of sources
(J1, M1) and (J2, M2) which are allowed to radiate in the medium and produce ﬁelds (E1, H1)
and (E2, H2), respectively. Using Maxwell’s equations, it can be shown that [31]:

V
(E1 • J2 −H1 • M2)dv =

V
(E2 • J1 −H2 • M1)dv
(5.115)
This is called the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. This can be interpreted to mean that the coupling
between a set of ﬁelds and a set of sources which produces another set of ﬁelds is the same
as the coupling between another set of ﬁelds and another set of sources. We can represent this
simply as
⟨1, 2⟩= ⟨2, 1⟩
(5.116)
Under this condition, from the circuit point of view, the mutual coupling impedances between
two antennas are the same
Z12 = Z21
(5.117)
The self-impedance, i.e. the antenna input impedance, is also the same for the transmitting or
receiving mode.

Transmitting and receiving systems and their equivalent circuits
From the ﬁeld point of view, the same conclusion can be arrived at; that is, the radiated ﬁeld
patterns are the same when the antenna is employed for transmitting or receiving.
Figure 5.52 shows the system conﬁguration for a typical transmitting and receiving system.
At the transmitting side, the transmitting antenna is just a load (Z A) to the feed line, as discussed
in Section 2.3.2 (impedance matching), the antenna impedance and source internal impedance
should meet the following condition to achieve the maximum transmission:
Z A
∗= ZT or RA −j X A = RT + j XT .
The power radiated is given by
Prad =
RA
RT + RA
PT
(5.118)
While at the receiving side, the receiving antenna is equivalent to a source with internal
impedance Z A,as shown in Figure 5.52, which is different from the transmitting antenna.
Similarly, to reach the maximum power transfer, the antenna impedance and the receiver
impedance should meet the following condition:
Z A
∗= Z R or RA −j X A = RR + j X R
and the power received by the receiver is given by
Prec =
RR
RA + RR
PR
(5.119)
For a perfect match, RA = RR, we have
Prec = 0.5PR ≤0.5
RA
RT + RA
PT
(5.120)
This means that the receiver gets half of the power collected by the receiving antenna and the
other half is reradiated. If both the transmitting and receiving sides are perfectly matched and

Popular Antennas
205
there is no propagation pathloss, the receiver can only yield 25% of the source power PT . This
percentage share can be increased to a maximum of 50% by increasing the radiating efﬁciency
RA
RT +RA towards 100%. For example, if RA = 300 
 and RT = 50 
,
RA
RT +RA ≈85.7% > 50%,
and the maximum possible received power is Prec = 0.5PR = 0.5
RA
RT +RA PT ≈0.43PT , which
is much greater than 25% of the source power. It should be pointed out that the mismatch
efﬁciency of the antenna to feed line, which was discussed in Section 4.2.1, has not been taken
into account here; this could become an issue at high frequencies.
From a system design point of view, the requirements on the transmitting antenna and the
receiving antenna are not the same. For transmitting, the paramount importance is to transmit
enough power to the desired directions, thus the maximum radiating efﬁciency and antenna gain
are the most important parameters. For receiving, the most important requirement is usually
a large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although the efﬁciency and gain are still important, low
side lobes may be more desirable than other parameters. Another thing is that the transient
responses of transmitting and receiving antennas are different: an (small) antenna acts as a
differentiator on transmit but a voltage probe (replica of the incident ﬁeld) on receive.
It is now clear that antenna properties (such as the radiation pattern and input impedance)
are basically the same whether it is used as a transmitting antenna or a receiving antenna.
Thus, there is no need to distinguish it as a transmitting or receiving antenna. However, the
design requirements for the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna are usually different in
practice. Thus, the design considerations for a transmitting antenna and for a receiving antenna
may be different.
5.4.2 Baluns and Impedance Matching
As discussed earlier, an antenna is normally connected to a transmission line and good matching
between them is very important. A coaxial cable is often employed to connect an antenna–
mainly due to its good performance and low cost. A half-wavelength dipole antenna with
impedance of about 73 ohms is widely used in practice. From the impedance-matching point
of view, this dipole can match well with a 50 or 75 ohm standard coaxial cable. Now the
question is: can we connect a coaxial cable directly to a dipole?
As illustrated in Figure 5.53, when a dipole is directly connected to a coaxial cable, there
is a problem: a part of the current coming from the outer conductor of the cable may go to the
outside of the outer conductor at the end and return to the source rather than ﬂow to the dipole.
This undesirable current will make the cable become part of the antenna and radiate or receive

unwanted signals, which could be a very serious problem in some cases. In order to resolve
this problem, a balun is required.
The term balun is an abbreviation of the two words balance and unbalance. It is a device
that connects a balanced antenna (a dipole, in this case) to an unbalanced transmission line (a
coaxial cable, where the inner conductor is not balanced with the outer conductor). The aim is
to eliminate the undesirable current coming back on the outside of the cable. There are a few
baluns developed for this important application. Figure 5.54 shows two examples. The sleeve
balun is a very compact conﬁguration: a metal tube of λ/4 is added to the cable to form another
transmission line (a coax again) with the outer conductor cable, and a short circuit is made at the
base which produces an inﬁnite impedance at the open top. The leaky current is reﬂected back
with a phase shift of 180 degrees, which results in the cancellation of the unwanted current on
the outside of the cable. This balun is a narrowband device. If the short-circuit end is made as
a sliding bar, it can be adjusted for a wide frequency range (but it is still a narrowband device).
The second example in Figure 5.54 is a ferrite-bead choke placed on the outside of the coaxial
cable. It is widely used in the EMC industry and its function is to produce a high impedance,
more precisely high inductance due to the large permeability of the ferrite, and act as a ﬁlter.
With good-quality ferrite beads, a large bandwidth may be obtained (an octave or more). But
this device is normally just suitable for the frequencies below 1 GHz, which is determined by
the ferrite properties. It should be pointed out that a choke is not usually termed a balun – also,
at high frequencies it can be lossy, which can reduce the measured antenna efﬁciency.
There are some other types of baluns; a good discussion can be found in [4]. For example,
the tapered balun (see the feed to the TEM horn antenna in Figure 5.23) is broadband but its
length is usually very long (> λ/2).
When combined with impedance-matching techniques, a balun can become an impedance
transformer (as well as a balun) [2]. The most well-known examples are the λ/2 coaxial balun
transformer (4:1) and ferrite core transformers (n:1). To connect a folded dipole (shown in
Figure 5.4) of impedance about 280 ohms to a coaxial cable of 50 ohms, a λ/2 coaxial balun
transformer could be used to obtain a good impedance match and balanced feed. A general
discussion on impedance-matching techniques was given in Section 2.3.2.
5.4.3 Antenna Polarization
Radio wave polarization was introduced in Section 3.2.2. There are linearly, circularly and
elliptically polarized waves. Antennas are the devices used to generate and receive these
waves. But how is the antenna polarization linked to the wave polarization?

The antenna polarizationisdeterminedbythepolarizationofitsradiatingwave.Forexample,
a dipole is a linearly polarized antenna since its radiating wave has just one component (Eθ).
This is relatively easy to understand. The difﬁculty comes with circularly polarized waves.
How does one generate a right-hand or left-hand circularly polarized wave?
5.4.3.1 Circular Polarization
We recall, from Equations (3.22) and (3.23), that a circularly polarized wave must have two
orthogonal electric ﬁeld components. They have the same amplitude but a phase difference
of 90 degrees. So far we have only discussed one circularly polarized antenna: the helical
antenna,whichisalsothemostpopularcircularlypolarizedantenna.Itproducestwoorthogonal
components Eθ and Eφ (given by Equations (5.21) and (5.22)), which are 90 degrees out of
phase.
There are many other antenna designs which can produce circular polarization. Four simple
examples are shown in Figure 5.55, where (a) shows two orthogonal dipoles which are fed
with a 90-degree phase difference (this can be generated by a phase shifter or λ/4 physical
separation). Which dipole is leading in phase determines the rotation of the circular wave,
LCP or RCP; if the radiation in one axial direction is LCP, it is RCP in the opposite axial
direction. Figure 5.55(b) shows a combination of a dipole and a loop, which are also of 90-
degree phase difference; (c) shows a slotted dipole cylinder and their feeds are also 90 degrees
out of phase; and (d) is a circular patched antenna with two symmetrical cuts which ensure
that two orthogonal currents are generated with a 90-degree phase difference. The ﬁrst three
conﬁgurations can provide omnidirectional patterns.
Some of the arrangements (such as the helical antenna or design (a) in Figure 5.55) can
be placed within a circular waveguide so as to generate a circular TE11 mode and a circular
polarized beam can be produced when the waveguide is ﬂared into a conical horn antenna.
Some of them can serve as a primary antenna of a reﬂector antenna so as to produce highly
directional and circular radiation.
5.4.3.2 Polarization Match and Mismatch
For a good radio communication system, the polarization must be matched. That is, a linearly
polarized wave can be received by a linearly co-polarized (not cross-polarized) antenna, and
similarly, a circularly polarized wave should be received by a circularly co-polarized antenna.
They must be of the same polarization, otherwise some or even all the received power could
be lost due to polarization mismatch. For example, if an incoming wave is of LCP, then the
receiving antenna must be of LCP. If it were of RCP, no signals would be produced at the

208
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
output of the receiving antenna. If it were linearly polarized, only half of the incoming power
could be received and the other half would be lost, i.e. there would be a 3 dB loss in power.
If the incoming wave is linearly polarized and the receiving antenna is circularly polarized,
is there a problem of polarization mismatch? The short answer is yes, depending on the
combination scheme once the signal is received. Generally speaking, the power loss could be
up to 3 dB due to polarization mismatch, which is much better than using a linearly polarized
antenna with orthogonal polarization! In some applications, the polarization of the incoming
signal is unknown or hard to predict. For example, if a linearly polarized wave is employed for
satellite communications, its polarization will be changed when passing through the ionosphere
due to Faraday rotation (which is caused by the free electrons in the ionosphere; the polarization
rotation is determined by the electrons and the wave frequency) – thus, a circular polarization
is usually employed. For radio communications in multipath environments (such as indoor),
linear polarization is used – because the signal polarization becomes random after multiple
reﬂections and could be said to be statistically uniform. The power loss due to polarization is
about 3 dB. If circular polarization is employed, the power loss may be much more signiﬁcant.
5.4.4 Radomes, Housings and Supporting Structures
The antenna is a transmitting and receiving device for a radio system and is normally made of
metal. It is not an isolated structure but an integrated part of a radio system. Sometimes a radome
is required in order to ensure its efﬁcient and desired operation. The radome (radar dome) is
deﬁned as the structure which houses an antenna (or the entire radar, including the antenna) and
is almost transparent to radio waves at the desired frequencies (normally above 1 GHz). It can be
constructed in several shapes (spherical, geodesic, planar, etc.) depending upon the particular
application. Various low-loss construction materials [3] are used, such as ﬁberglass, foam,
FTFE and coated fabric or plastic. The main reasons for using such a radome or housing are
r to protect an antenna from the ravages of the environment: wind, snow, ice, rain, salt, sand,
the sun (UV) and even lightning;
r to make the whole structure mechanically sound and viable;
r to conceal the antenna system from spying or the public view; and
r to keep nearby personnel away from being accidentally struck by a fast-moving antenna or
affecting the antenna performance.
A few examples of antennas with radomes or housings are shown in Figure 5.56. Radomes
are normally much larger than the antenna. Some housing structures are just slightly larger
than the antenna and may not be called radomes, such as the mobile phone case, but they play
the same role as radomes. Two of the most important questions asked in practice are
r How are these radomes and housing structures designed?
r What are the effects of the radome or housing on the antenna performance?
5.4.4.1 Design of Radomes and Housings
The antenna radome or housing design is a complex issue. Ideally, it should be incorporated
into the antenna design; that is, it should be considered part of the antenna system. In practice,

Popular Antennas
209

Examples of antennas with various radomes/housings. (Reproduced by permission of
Guidance Ltd, UK)
this is problematic. The radome or housing design may be conducted by another department or
company. The basic requirement is that the radome or housing structure should be transparent
to the operational frequencies of the antenna, which means that the reﬂection coefﬁcient and
loss must be small and the transmission coefﬁcient must be large (as close to 1 as possible).
From Section 3.3.1, we know that this requirement can be achieved when the thickness of the
structure is an integer multiple of half of the effective wavelength in the medium. This thickness
is actually a function of the incident angle as well as the frequency and dielectric properties
(ε, μ, σ). The material is normally of low loss and low permittivity. Since the radome or
housing has to meet both the electrical and mechanical requirements, the structure is often
made from a multilayered material. The sandwich conﬁguration is chosen: hard and reinforced
materials are used to form the outer layers and a thick layer of low-permittivity material is
placed at the center. This conﬁguration provides the mechanically required robustness and at
the same time offers the broad bandwidth and low loss for the RF signals.
5.4.4.2 Effects of Radomes and Housings
The effects of the radome and housing on the antenna include the following two aspects.
r From the ﬁeld point of view, the existence of the radome or housing may affect the antenna
aperture ﬁeld distribution and hence the radiation pattern and directivity/gain. A slightly

210
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
reduced gain (<1 dB) and increased side lobes are expected in practice, depending on the
quality of the radome/housing.
r From the circuit point of view, the load impedance to the antenna feed line may be changed,
depending on how close the housing structure and the antenna are. The closer they are, the
larger the effect. The effect may be reﬂected on the input impedance and hence the VSWR.
A common observation is that the resonant frequency is shifted downwards (is lower) when
the antenna housing is in place, since the wavelength is decreased inside a medium (by √εr).
5.4.4.3 Antenna Supporting Structure
Once an antenna is designed and made, it has to be installed somewhere. TV reception antennas
are often erected on a roof and mobile base-station antennas are normally attached to a post
or tower, as shown in Figure 5.57. Ideally, the antenna siting or supporting structure should
have nothing to do with the antenna performance. However, the antenna is a radiating device
and the radiation is deﬁned by its radiation pattern. The antenna near-ﬁeld distribution is more
complex than that of the far ﬁeld. Generally speaking, the supporting structure should not be
in the radiation region and a dielectric material is preferred over a metal structure, since its
interaction with the antenna is much smaller.
As the interaction between the antenna and the housing and supporting structure can only
be analyzed case by case, there are no general formulas or equations for the prediction. The
accurate estimate of this interaction should be conducted using computer simulation software,
which could be slow and expensive. But sometimes it is worth paying such a cost.

5.5 Summary
In this chapter we have studied many popular antennas, introduced all relevant theories and
showed how to use these theories for antenna analysis and design. Wire-type antennas, aperture-
type antennas and antenna arrays have been covered. These antennas have been dealt with from
both the ﬁeld point of view and the circuit point of view. Almost all the antennas introduced have
been provided with design procedures or guidelines. Some practical considerations (including
baluns and housings) have also been addressed.

Computer-Aided Antenna Design
and Analysis
In the previous chapter we introduced and analyzed some of the most popular antennas, and
discussed what the important considerations are from the design point of view. You should
now be able to design some basic standard antennas (such as dipoles) without resorting to a
computer. However, antenna design is a very challenging subject since there are usually many
variables involved, even for a given type of antenna. Due to signiﬁcant advances in computer
hardware and software over the past two decades, it has now become standard practice to
employ software to aid antenna design – just as in any other industry. The objective of this
chapter is therefore to give a brief review of antenna software development, introduce the
basic theory behind computer simulation tools and demonstrate how to use industrial standard
software to analyze and design antennas.
6.1 Introduction
Astheantennaequation(4.3)indicates,thepredictionofantennaperformanceisaverycomplex
issue and the analytical approach is only suitable for antennas of simple geometry. In the past,
engineers designed antennas by experience and a certain amount of ‘black magic’. A good
understanding of antennas and impedance-matching theory and techniques, and the ability to
accomplish a good match over the desired frequency range were required. After the prospective
antenna was designed and built, there always remained the question of whether the antenna had
met the speciﬁcations. Thus, an antenna measurement using a test range had to be conducted
in order to verify that all design criteria were met. Next, if all went well on the testing, the
prospective antenna would be transferred to the production department. Finally, the production
antennas would be tested to verify that the design could be duplicated. However, if the measured
results were not good enough, some tuning and modiﬁcations had to be made and further tests
were required. This process normally included minding, tinkering, cut-and-try and gluing and
screwing parts together until the antenna met the desired speciﬁcations. Needless to say, this
was a very expensive and time-consuming procedure.

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Those days are now gone forever. We live in a competitive market where time and perfor-
mance are critical. Guesswork and long design cycles are out of the question. New state-of-
the-art antennas are required to meet all the design criteria for sophisticated applications that
may involve large quantities at competitive cost. Various commercial antenna design software
packages have been developed with very good accuracy and multi-functions and these are
widely used in the industry. The ability to use computer-aided design (CAD) tools has become
an essential requirement for a good antenna engineer.
Now let us look back to see how the antenna design software has evolved. In the mid-1960s,
mainframe computers were ﬁnally fast enough to conduct antenna modeling. However, it still
required an astute antenna design engineer with a good analytic mathematical background to
write the equations and computer programs to model antennas. In the 1970s, the Numerical
Electromagnetic Code (NEC) program was developed using FORTRAN (a computer com-
putational program) by the US government [1]. This program was accurate and suitable for
wire-type antennas but difﬁcult to use and required a large mainframe computer. Furthermore,
its use was restricted by the government. This all changed in the mid-1980s when personal
computers (PCs) became widely available. Soon there were several antenna-modeling pro-
grams available. The primary one was MININEC, a smaller program based on NEC that ran
fast on a PC [2 and 3]. Also, a PC version of NEC became available. As PCs increased in speed,
so did the antenna-modeling programs. It was not unusual to wait for hours or more for the
analysis of an antenna. Nowadays, PCs with powerful processors can model the same antenna
in just a few seconds. In the 1990s, a large number of EM simulation tools and antenna design
software packages, based on various methods, were developed and appeared on the market.
They are suitable not only for wire-type antennas but also aperture-type antennas. Many of
these packages have been updated every one or two years, with new functions and improved
algorithms added. For example, parametric optimization is now available. These programs will
perform the optimization for you. All you need to do is to input a reasonable design along with
a properly weighted trade-off or ﬁgure of merit (FoM). The FoM weighs the relative impor-
tance of each antenna parameter such as the gain, pattern and impedance over a set of input
frequencies and an optimized design will then be produced by the computer. These powerful
modeling programs allow the antenna designer to use keystrokes on a PC keyboard instead of
getting their hands dirty from hours of cutting and testing the actual antenna. Furthermore, the
performance goals can be tested before any actual antenna is constructed. You can now cut-
and-try an antenna design for maximum gain, front-to-back ratio, impedance or a combination
of the three by changing element lengths, diameters and spacings using only a keyboard. This
signiﬁcantly shortens the design to completion of production process for antennas.
The above may give the impression that antenna design is no longer a ‘black art’. While
this may be true, it still requires a lot of knowledge and understanding of the interrelated
parameters in the antenna design, FoM and the software itself. In fact, as the antenna designs of
today get more complicated, so does the work of the antenna designer. The antenna-modeling
and optimization programs available today do not completely compensate for all variables.
The output data ﬁle must be properly interpreted by the user. Sometimes the tolerances of the
element dimensions may be difﬁcult to realize. Element correction factors may still be required
to compensate for the mechanical mounting of the antenna elements. Sometimes the simulation
results may not be accurate enough for practical reasons (such as limited computer memory
or poor convergence). This is where the antenna designer comes in to play. One must be able
to realize which designs can and cannot be built, in addition to any compensation that may be

Computer-Aided Antenna Design and Analysis
217
required. After all, computers are just computers and their outputs are just numbers, they will
never replace innovative engineers in analyzing and designing antennas. Modeling and design
software do not design an antenna for you. They only predict how the inputted antenna design
should perform, and leave it up to the ingenuity of the antenna designer to ‘tweak’ or optimize
the mechanical dimensions until the desired antenna performance is attained.
In summary, to become a modern professional antenna designer, one has to have a com-
prehensive understanding of antennas, a good grasp of mechanical engineering principles and
excellent skills in using computer-modeling and optimization software to aid the design.
6.2 Computational Electromagnetics for Antennas
Computational electromagnetics (CEM) is a unique subject of interest to all electromagnetics
engineers and researchers. It has a very wide range of applications in RF engineering, EMC,
radar, wireless communications, electrical and electronic engineering, and extends to areas
such as biomedical engineering – antennas are just one of the areas. Many methods have been
developed over the years; some were ﬁrst introduced for other applications. Generally speak-
ing, CEM can be divided into numerical methods and high-frequency methods, as shown in
Figure 6.1. High-frequency methods are suitable for structures much larger than the wave-
length, while numerical methods are more suitable for smaller structures. There is no speciﬁc
boundary between these two groups. As a rule of thumb, 20λ is usually used as the upper limit
for numerical methods, which is really determined by the computation power (memory size
and computational time).
Numerical methods can be subdivided into frequency domain methods (such as the method
of moments and the ﬁnite element method) and time domain methods (e.g. the ﬁnite-difference
time domain method and the transmission line modeling method). High-frequency methods
can be subdivided into ﬁeld-based methods (the geometrical optics method) and current-based
methods (the physical optics method). Although cost-effective electromagnetic software is
readily available and it is now not necessary to write your own software from scratch, a good
understanding of the principles on which the software is based is necessary in order to set the
relevant parameters properly and avoid the misuse and misinterpretation of the results.

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
In this section we are going to ﬁrst use the method of moments as an example to see how a
numerical method can be employed to model and analyze an antenna, then we will introduce
some other methods. A general comparison of these methods will be made in Section 6.2.5.
6.2.1 Method of Moments (MoM)
The method of moments (MoM, or moment method) was ﬁrst introduced in mathematics. The
basic idea is to transform an integral or differential equation into a set of simultaneous linear
algebraic equations (or matrix equation) which may then be solved by numerical techniques
[4, 5, 6]. It was ﬁrst applied to electromagnetic problems in the 1960s. Roger Harrington
was the person who made the most signiﬁcant contribution to this area [5, 6]. His book,
Field Computation by Moment Methods [6], was the ﬁrst book to explore the computation of
electromagnetic ﬁelds by the method of moments – the most popular method to date for the
numerical solution of electromagnetic ﬁeld problems. It presents a uniﬁed approach to MoM
by employing the concepts of linear spaces and functional analysis. Written especially for
those who have a minimal amount of experience in electromagnetic theory, theoretical and
mathematical concepts are illustrated by examples that prepare readers with the skills they
need to apply the method of moments to new, engineering-related problems. In this subsection
we are going to introduce the concept of MoM and apply it to model and analyze a dipole
antenna.
6.2.1.1 Introduction to MoM
Let us deal with a general case: a linear equation
L(F) = g
(6.1)
where L is a known linear operator, g is a known excitation function and F is the unknown
function to be determined. In physics, L means the system transfer function and g represents
the source. The objective is to determine F once L and g are speciﬁed.
First, the function F is expanded using a series of known basis functions (or expansion
functions) f1, f2, f3, . . . in the domain of operator L, we have
F =

n
In fn
(6.2)
where In are unknown complex coefﬁcients to be determined and n = 1, 2, . . . N. N should
be inﬁnite in theory but is a limited number in practice.
We can replace F in Equation (6.1) by Equation (6.2) and use the linearity of L to give

n
InL( fn) = g
(6.3)
The problem becomes how to determine these unknown coefﬁcients In.

219
Secondly, a set of weighting functions (or testing functions) W1, W2, W3, . . . in the domain
of L is chosen and then the inner product is formed:

n
In⟨Wm, L( fn)⟩= ⟨Wm, g⟩
(6.4)
where m = 1, 2, . . . M. Again, M should be inﬁnite in theory but is a ﬁnite number in practice
and a typical, but not unique, inner product is deﬁned as
⟨x(z), y(z)⟩= ⟨y(z), x(z)⟩=

L
x(z)y(z)dz
(6.5)
Thirdly, the inner product is performed on Equation (6.4) for m = 1 to M to give the matrix
equation:
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣
< W1, L( f1) > < W1, L( f2) > . . . < W1, L( fN) >
< W2, L( f1) > < W2, L( f2) >
< W2, L( fN) >
. . .
< WM, L( f1) >
. . .
< WM, L( fN) >
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣

IN
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦=
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣
< W1, g >
< W2, g >
.
< WM, g >
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦
(6.6)
or, in more compact form:
[Zmn] [In] = [Vm]
(6.7)
where
Zmn =< Wm, L( fn) >
(6.8)
and
Vm =< Wm, g >
(6.9)
They are now readily obtained and the unknown coefﬁcients can be yielded as
[In] = [Zmn]−1 [Vm]
(6.10)
The unknown function F can therefore be obtained approximately using Equations (6.2) and
(6.10).
The selection of the basis functions and weighting functions is a key to obtaining accurate
solutions efﬁciently and successfully. In general, the basis functions should have the ability to
accurately represent and resemble the anticipated unknown function. There are many possible
basis/weighting function sets, but only a limited number are used in practice. The elements of
these functions must be linearly independent, so that the N equations in Equation (6.6) will
also be linearly independent and give a unique solution. In addition, they should be chosen to

220
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
minimize the computations required to evaluate the inner product. If both the basis functions
and weighting functions are the same, then this special procedure is known as Galerkin’s
method. We are going to use the example below to show how to implement the MoM in
practice.
Example 6.1: MoM. Solve the following differential equation using the MoM:
d2F(z)
dz2
= 1 + 2z2
(6.11)
for 0 ≤z ≤1with the boundary conditions: F(0) = F(1) = 0.
Solution:
This is a simple boundary problem. The transfer function is
L = d2
dz2
and the source is
g(z) = 1 + 2z2
It is not difﬁcult to obtain the exact solution of this differential equation as
F(z) = −2
3z + 1
2z2 + 1
6z4
(6.12)
There are many basis and weighting functions which may be suitable for this problem. The
selection of these functions is crucial. Here we are going to use Galerkin’s method to solve
this problem.
According to the format of the source g(z), it is natural to choose the basis function as
fn(z) = zn. However, you will ﬁnd in the end that the boundary condition F(1) = 0 cannot
be met. Taking the boundary conditions into account, we can choose the basis functions and
weighting functions as
fn(z) = Wn(z) = z −zn+1
(6.13)
and the inner product is deﬁned as
< fm(z), fn(z) >=
 1

fm(z) fn(z)dz
(6.14)

This is now the same as the exact solution given by Equation (6.12). It is not difﬁcult to
verify that, when N > 3, the solutions are unchanged, i.e. the same as Equation (6.12). From
Figures 6.2 and 6.3 we can see that the accuracy of the numerical solutions increases with N,
and this means that the results converge. It is very important to have a convergent solution. If
the result does not converge, it normally indicates that the basis and weighting functions have
not been properly chosen and are not suitable for the problem.
This example has successfully demonstrated the usefulness of the MoM in solving linear
equations. Through this exercise we have seen that a differential equation has been converted
to a matrix equation, which is easy to solve and the results are very accurate.
Next, we are going to see how to use the MoM to analyze and model a dipole antenna.

6.2.1.2 Analysis of a Dipole Antenna Using the MoM
The MoM has been widely used to solve wire-type antenna problems. Here we are going to
take a dipole of length 2l and diameter 2a as an example, shown in Figure 6.4, to illustrate the
application of the MoM in antennas.
The total electric ﬁeld at any point in the space can be expressed as the sum of the incident
ﬁeld Ei and scattered/radiated ﬁeld Es:
Et(r) = Ei(r) + Es(r)
(6.16)
Since the dipole is made of a perfect conductor (a good conductor in reality), the total
tangential electric ﬁeld must be zero on the surface of the antenna, that is
Ei
z(r) + Es
z(r) = 0; on the antenna
(6.17)
For a receiving antenna or scatterer, the incident ﬁeld is usually a plane wave. For a trans-
mitting antenna, the incident ﬁeld can be seen as the excitation of the antenna and there are
two source models: the delta gap source and the magnetic frill generator [8, 9]. The most used
source model is the delta gap model, which is also chosen for our investigation. In Figure 6.4,
a voltage source of 2V0 (from +V0 to −V0 ) is applied across the feeding gap 2, the incident
ﬁeld can therefore be expressed as
Ei
z(r) =

V0/; for |z| < 
0; for  < |z| < l ; on the antenna
(6.18)
The general radiated ﬁeld can be represented by the antenna equation (4.3) as

On the surface of the antenna, the current density can be replaced by a line-source current I(z),
we have
 l

I(z′)K(z, z′)dz′ = −Ei

(6.20)
where the kernel is given by
K(z, z′) =

(6.21)
Equation (6.20) is known as Pocklington’s integral equation and has been used extensively for
dipole antennas. The problem has now become how to determine the current I(z) by solving
this integral equation.
Using the MoM, we need to choose a set of basis functions. The operator in this case is an
integral with a complex kernel. Although we can select the entire domain basis functions as
in Example 6.1, we prefer to use sub-domain functions, which should make the inner product
computation much simpler and faster.
The antenna can be divided equally into N segments, as shown in Figure 6.5. The unit pulse
function is deﬁned as
Pn(z) =

⎩

and is chosen for the basis functions, thus the current on the dipole is approximated as

(6.23)
This expansion in terms of pulse functions is a staircase approximation. The current is constant
on each segment. The larger N, the more accurate the solution should be.

We can use Galerkin’s method again, which can produce a reasonable solution. A better
weighting function for this case is the Dirac delta function δ(z), which is
Wm(z) = δ(z −zm)
(6.24)
where zm is the z-coordinate of the center of the segment m, mathematically it is
zm = −l + 2l
N (m −0.5); and m = 1, 2, . . . , N
(6.25)
A very useful feature of the Dirac delta function is

f (z)δ(z −z0)dz = f (z0)
(6.26)
This approach is called the pulse-expansion and point-matching MoM. The integral equation
is enforced at N points along the antenna axis. The inner product can be deﬁned as
< fm(z), fn(z) >=
 l
−l
fm(z) fn(z)dz
(6.27)
Thus, the element

We can let N be an odd number and choose the central segment as the feed to simplify the
computation.
It should be pointed out that if the matching point and the source point are at the same place,
the distance r will be zero and the kernel will be inﬁnite – this is a problem. A reasonable way
to avoid this singularity is to let the current source be at the center of the wire and the matching
point on the antenna surface, that is
Rm = r

where

Now Pocklington’s integral equation (6.20) is transformed into the following matrix equation:
[Zmn] [In] = [Vm]
(6.34)
All elements of Zmn and Vm can be computed easily and the unknown coefﬁcients In can now
be obtained without difﬁculty. Hence, the current distribution along the antenna can be found
using Equation (6.23) and is illustrated by Figure 6.6.
Other important antenna parameters can also be obtained. For example, the input impedance
is given by
Za = 2V0
IN/2

and the total radiated ﬁeld (and hence the radiation pattern) can be calculated using

For a half-wavelength dipole, the convergence of the calculated impedance as a function of
the number of segments N is shown in Figure 6.7. When N is small, the impedance is not
stable. When N > 20, the resistance approaches 80 ohms and the reactance is close to 0 ohms,
which are comparable with measured results.
Using this program, we can produce a lot of results for different antennas, without actually
making any antennas. From Figure 6.8, which is also shown in Table 5.1, we can clearly see
how the current distribution varies with the antenna length in wavelengths and how the current
distribution determines the radiation pattern.
6.2.1.3 Discussion and Conclusions

to note:
r the selection of the basis and weighting functions is crucial, this may affect the complexity
and time of computation as well as the accuracy of the results;
r if the result converges, then the more segments, the more accurate it will be (but with an
increased memory requirement and computation time!);
r if the result does not converge, it usually means that the basis and weighting functions are
not suitable;
r using the point-matching technique, the segment length should be smaller than λ/10, it is
usually about λ/20, which is also generally required by other simulation methods;
r there is a trade-off between the accuracy and computation requirements (memory and time) –
this is a conclusion that is applicable to all numerical methods.
Although we have only applied the MoM to a dipole antenna, the method is general and
can be easily applied to other wire-type antennas. It can even be used to solve aperture-type
antenna problems. Another beauty of it is that it can be combined with high-frequency methods
to deal with electrically large problems. Some very good commercial software packages are
already available on the market and will be discussed later in this chapter.
6.2.2 Finite Element Method (FEM)
The Finite Element Method (FEM) was originally introduced for solving complex elasticity,
structural analysis problems in civil engineering and aeronautical engineering. Its development
can be traced back to the work of Alexander Hrennikoff [12]. The method was often based
on an energy principle, e.g. the virtual work principle or the minimum total potential energy
principle, which provides a general, intuitive and physical basis that has a great appeal to
structural engineers. A rigorous mathematical foundation was provided by Strang and Fix in
their book An Analysis of the Finite Element Method published in 1973 [13], and the method
has since been generalized into a branch of applied mathematics for numerical modeling of
physical systems in a wide variety of engineering disciplines, e.g. electromagnetics and ﬂuid
dynamics. It has been used for ﬁnding approximate solutions of partial differential equations
as well as integral equations, and is particularly suitable for problems involving irregular
boundaries and nonhomogenous material properties.
The FEM may be implemented in the following four steps:
1. Discretization of the solution region into elements (usually triangular in shape).
2. Generation of equations for the ﬁelds or potentials at each element.
3. Integration or assembly of all elements.
4. Solution of the resulting system of equations.
Just like the MoM, the problem is also converted into a matrix equation at the end. The FEM
has been employed by a large number of commercial EM simulation packages and has become
one of the most popular and established numerical techniques in engineering. An example of
how the region of a loop antenna is discretized into FEM elements is shown in Figure 6.9.
The obtained current distribution on the loop is also shown in the ﬁgure. In Section 6.3 we are
going to use FEM-based software to simulate and design antennas. For more details about this
technique, refer to [14, 15].

6.2.3 Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Method
The Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method belongs in the general class of grid-
based differential time domain numerical modeling methods. It was introduced by Yee in 1966
[16]. Since then signiﬁcant developments have been made in improving, implementing and
spreading this method [17, 18, 19]. The boundary conditions were one of the major problems
of this method.
The problem domain is discretized into many cells (usually square or rectangular), known
as Yee cells/lattices. A typical one is shown in Figure 6.10. The time-dependent partial dif-
ferential Maxwell equations given in Equation (1.29) are discretized using central-difference
approximations to the space and time partial derivatives. The resulting ﬁnite-difference equa-
tions are solved in a leapfrog manner: the electric ﬁeld vector components in a volume of
space are solved at a given instant in time, then the magnetic ﬁeld vector components in the
same spatial volume are solved at the next instant in time. This process is repeated over and
over again until the desired transient or steady-state electromagnetic ﬁeld behavior is fully

evolved. This scheme has proven to be very robust and remains at the core of many current
FDTD software constructs. Furthermore, Yee proposed a leapfrog scheme for marching in
time where, in the E-ﬁeld and H-ﬁeld, updates are staggered so that E-ﬁeld updates are con-
ducted midway during each time step between successive H-ﬁeld updates, and conversely.
On the plus side, this explicit time-stepping scheme avoids the need to solve simultaneous
equations, and furthermore yields dissipation-free numerical wave propagation. On the minus
side, this scheme mandates an upper bound on the time step to ensure numerical stability. As
a result, certain classes of simulation can require many thousands (or more) of time steps for
completion.
The accuracy of the computed results is basically determined by the cell size and time
steps, which is simpler and easier than making the right choices on basis and weighting
functions in the MoM. The cell size is determined by the highest frequency of interest. The
biggest dimensions of the cell should normally be smaller than λmin/20, and the time step
size t ≤1/c


(x)2 +

(y)2 +

(z)2 . Thus, this is limited by the computational power as for
any other numerical method. One of the advantages of this method is that material properties
(ε, μ, σ) can be accommodated easily into the computational scheme, in just the way they
appear in Maxwell’s equations.
Since it is a time domain method, the method is extremely suitable for solving wideband
problems, but narrowband problems may take a long time to converge. Today the FDTD has
become the most popular time domain method in computational electromagnetics. A number
of well-known computer simulation tools were developed based on this technique.
6.2.4 Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) Method
The Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) method is another well-known time domain mod-
eling method, which was originally introduced by Professor P. B. Johns at the University of
Nottingham, UK [20]. The main features of this method are its simplicity and the use of the
transmission line model, which means that lumped elements are used. The method has evolved
and been developed over the years [21, 22, 23]. The simulation domain is divided into many
nodes; a typical one is shown in Figure 6.11. All ﬁelds (E and H) and material properties are
represented by transmission line elements (such asV and I). The simulation is also imple-
mented in a time-iterative fashion like FDTD. In fact, this method is very similar to the FDTD
although originating from different ideas. An interesting comparison between them was made
in [24]. Again, there are some commercial simulation packages based on this method, the most
notable is MicroStripes produced by Flomerics [25]. An evaluation version can be downloaded
from relevant websites.
6.2.5 Comparison of Numerical Methods
There are many other numerical methods (e.g. boundary element methods [26]) which are also
used for electromagnetic simulations but are less popular (this does not mean less accurate)
than the ones we have discussed. All these numerical methods need to divide the structure
of interest into many cells/elements; some approximations are then used to convert the prob-
lem into an easily solvable one (such as a matrix equation). A common problem of these

approaches is the huge demand on computer memory and computation time. The accuracy
of most commercial packages is quite comparable; the computation efﬁciency and storage
requirements are varied, depending on speciﬁc problems. A comparison of frequency and time
domain methods is given in Table 6.1. Every method and every software package has its ad-
vantages and disadvantages but none is perfect. When these methods are applied to antenna
analysis, care has to be taken. For example, the maximum dimension of each cell/element
should be smaller than λ/20 to ensure the accuracy of the results. Some methods (such as the
MoM) can easily deal with very thin wire problems whilst other methods ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
handle such problems. When choosing a method or software, all these aspects should be taken
into account.

6.2.6 High-Frequency Methods
Numerical methods are generally of good accuracy and ﬂexibility for various conﬁgurations.
When applied to electrically large structures, they all have problems such as computer memory,
runtime or convergence – this is true even for very well-written commercial software based
on these methods. The modeling is at present too computationally demanding to be useful for
such problems. However, high-frequency methods [27] are particularly suitable for electrically
large structures where the wave nature of the radio wave need not be considered. Methods used
in optics, a well-developed subject, can be employed for electromagnetic and antenna analysis.
These high-frequency methods are usually divided into ﬁeld-based methods and current-based
methods.
Geometricaloptics(GO)orrayopticsisaﬁeld-basedmethodanddescribeslightpropagation
in terms of ‘rays’ which are perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual optical waves [27, 28].
GO provides rules for propagating these rays through an optical system, which indicates how
the actual wave front will propagate. The basic idea is that the ﬁeld at distance R away from
the source can be obtained using the ﬁeld in the same tube of rays at distance L away from the
source, i.e.
|E(R)| = |E(L)| L
R
(6.37)
This agrees with the conclusion we have obtained for the antenna far ﬁeld where the ﬁeld is
inversely proportional to the distance. A lot of problems may then be solved by a ray-tracing
method.
Itshould be pointedoutthatGOisasigniﬁcantsimpliﬁcationofopticsandfailstoaccountfor
many important optical effects such as diffraction and polarization. Sometimes it is inadequate
to completely describe the behavior of the EM ﬁeld and it is necessary to include the diffracted
ﬁeld – this theory is known as the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) and the theory
for wedge diffraction is called the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD). The combination
of GO/GTD/UTD has been applied to large antenna analysis and simulation for many years
[29, 30]. Hybrid methods using GO/GTD/UTD with numerical methods (e.g. the MoM) have
successfully developed to deal with complex large problems such as antennas mounted on the
surface of an electrically large structure [31, 32, 33].
Physical optics (PO) or wave optics is a current-based method, building on Huygens’s
principle (which was discussed in earlier chapters), and models the propagation of complex
wave fronts through propagation channels, including both the amplitude and the phase of the
wave. This technique can account for diffraction, interference and polarization effects, as well
as aberrations and other complex effects, thus it is more general than GO. Equivalent current
sources in the illuminated regions are obtained using the equivalence principle introduced in
Chapter 3. For a perfect conductor, the equivalent surface current is
Je =
ˆn × H;
in the illuminated region
0;
in the shadowed region
(6.38)
Once the current is known, the radiated ﬁeld can be found using an equation such as Equa-
tion (4.3). Approximations are still generally used when applied numerically on a computer.

Computer-Aided Antenna Design and Analysis
233
Just like GO, PO has also inherited limitations on dealing with diffraction. The physical
theory of diffraction (PTD) has been developed as an extension of PO that reﬁnes the PO
surface ﬁeld approximation just as GTD or UTD reﬁne the GO surface ﬁeld approximation;
more information can be found in [27], for example.
Typical applications of high-frequency methods include the calculation of scattering and
diffraction, radar cross-section (RCS), the effects of a ﬁnite antenna ground plane, electrically
large antennas (such as reﬂector antennas) and the interaction between antennas and mounting
structures.
It is apparent that high-frequency methods are very useful for the analysis of electrically
large structures, which may not be the antennas themselves but the mounting structures. These
methods offer the following advantages:
r there is no limitation on the maximum dimension of the structure for the simulation, nor
is there any runtime overhead in increasing the frequency for the same dimensions of the
structure;
r they are not memory or runtime intensive;
r they can compute the interaction of an antenna with a structure which takes over from
numerical methods when these become unusable.
6.3 Examples of Computer-Aided Design and Analysis
A large number of electromagnetic modeling software packages have been developed and are
available on the market. Some are more successful technically and commercially than others.
Some have become industrial standard design and analysis software. It is not possible to give an
exhaustive list of the software available (it is a fast-moving industry). In this book we can only
deal with some of the popular ones. Since these packages have been developed by many people
for many years, they are now well written and normally have a very user-friendly interface
for the designer to input the design, and the simulated results can be well presented in 2D
or even 3D graphs. There is no point in an individual researcher/engineer developing another
general simulation package and reinventing the wheel. However, there is always demand for
specialized software, which may perform better than the general purpose software for speciﬁc
applications.
In this section we are going to use two commercial software packages with different com-
plexity and features to design various antennas. It is hoped that, through these design examples,
the reader will gain a better understanding of antenna theory and be able to use some industrial
standard software to aid antenna design. Most software suppliers nowadays offer free evalua-
tion packages, which have limited functionality or a limited period of time for the license, but
they are good learning tools, enabling one to experiment with designing some simple antennas.
The reader is encouraged to explore various packages before any purchase is made. This book
does not compare commercial packages and does not offer any shopping advice.
6.3.1 Wire-type Antenna Design and Analysis
As mentioned earlier, the MoM-based NEC program was one of the earliest computer programs
developed for wire-type antenna modeling and design. Similar Windows-based commercial

234
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
packages are readily available. EZNEC [34] and MININEC [35] are just two well-known
examples. Demonstration/evaluation versions, which are basic with a very limited number of
segments and restricted functionality, are available for free download. The full versions offer
excellent capability (over 1000 segments) at an affordable price (EZNEC cost US$89 and
MININEC Professional cost US$790 in 2007). They are great tools for beginners, amateurs
and even professionals.
In this subsection we are going to use the EZNEC demonstration version as our design tool,
to introduce the major features of this kind of software and to see how it can be used to aid the
design and analysis of wire-type antennas.
6.3.1.1 EZNEC
EZNEC is a MoM-based powerful but very easy-to-use program for modeling and analyzing
various (especially wire-type) antennas in their intended operating environment. It was de-
veloped by Roy Lewallen (W7EL) and has evolved over the years [34]. This Windows-based
program is very user friendly and there is a pull-down menu to provide help whenever needed.
There are also some examples and a test drive exercise provided with the software package. It
takes just a few hours for a new user to become familiar with the program. The major features
of this software are:
r The antenna is constructed by straight-wire conductors, thus a surface structure is approxi-
mated with wire meshes.
r The input of the antenna is done via a spreadsheet-like entry, the start and end coordinates
are required, so is the number of segments.
r The simulation set-up is very straightforward and many short-cuts are built in.
r The computation is very fast and efﬁcient. The results are accurate enough for most wire-type
antennas.
r 2D current distribution and 2D and 3D plots of radiation patterns are available; other in-
formation such as the gain, input impedance, VSWR, 3 dB beamwidth, front-to-back ratio,
take-off angle and side lobe characteristics are also readily available.
r If required, transmission lines, a realistic ground and loads to simulate loading coils, traps
or similar components can be selected and added to the simulation.
r Antenna descriptions and pattern plots are easily saved and recalled for future analysis.
Multiple patterns can be superimposed on a single graph for comparison. You can see the
pattern and antenna currents on the same colour 3D display as the antenna, you can also
rotate the antenna display and zoom in for details.
6.3.1.2 Design Examples
Example 6.2: 14 MHz dipole for Ham radio transceiver. 14 MHz (20 m band) is one of the
amateur radio (ham radio) bands widely used around the world. Assume that you are going to
make a dipole as a transceiver antenna which will be placed in your garden. Use EZNEC to
design the antenna and analyze the effects of the ground plane on the antenna input impedance,
gain and radiation pattern. Horizontal polarization is assumed.

Figure 6.12
EZNEC user interface (Src: source; FF: far ﬁeld; NF: near ﬁeld)
Solution:
14 MHz has a wavelength of 21.4 m. To make a resonant and efﬁcient dipole, the dipole length
L should be close to λ/2, more precisely, L ≈0.48λ ≈10 m, which is affected by the ground.
Now let’s use EZNEC Demo V.50 (it is free!) to aid the analysis and design. On opening
the software, we see the user interface, as shown in Figure 6.12, which is basically divided
into two areas: the one on the left is for data input and output and the other one (in the center)
is to deﬁne the antenna to be simulated. The simulation should follow these steps: deﬁne the
antenna ⇒view the input antenna ⇒run the simulation ⇒check the results.
The main options to set up the simulation are:
1. Frequency: this means the central one, 14 MHz in our case.
2. Units: there are ﬁve options: m, mm, ft, in and wavelength; we choose ‘m’.
3. Wires that form the antenna: this means entering the end coordinates of each straight wire,
the diameter and the number of segments. You can even input the coating material if
applicable, as seen in Figure 6.13. Each segment should be smaller than λ/20. A wire of
10 m is divided into 20 segments as the ﬁrst attempt for our design. Clicking on ‘View

antenna’, gives Figure 6.14, which shows the antenna (3 m above the ground ﬂoor z = 0)
and the coordinates.
4. Sources: the source location, amplitude and phase. Our selection is shown in Figure 6.15.
For a center-fed case, it would be better to choose an odd number of segments (such as
19), so the actual position is the speciﬁed one.
5. Loads: the load impedance at a speciﬁc location if applicable.
6. Transmission line: location, length, characteristic impedance and loss if used.
7. Transformer and L Networks for matching: the port locations and impedances.
8. Ground type: there are three options: free space, perfect conducting ground and real ground,
which may be deﬁned by the user.
9. Wire loss: you can choose a predeﬁned material (such as copper or a perfect conductor
with zero loss) or a user-deﬁned one.
10. Plot type: 2D (azimuth or elevation) or 3D.
To analyze the effects of the ground plane, we are going to choose three different grounds:
free space, a perfect conductor and real ground.
a) Free space. First, assuming that the antenna is in free space, we need to select the ground
type as ‘free space’. Click on ‘SWR’ to deﬁne the sweep frequency and then click on ‘FF plot’
to start the simulation.

Figure 6.16
VSWR for a 10 m dipole in free space
The results for 10 to 20 MHz are given in Figure 6.16. It is shown that this 10 m dipole
resonates around 14.5 MHz with an input impedance of 72.63 −j4.006 ohms. When it is
connected to a 50 ohm transmission line, the VSWR is about 1.46. These numerical results (as
well as the radiation pattern in Figure 6.18(a)) are in excellent agreement with our theoretical
ones given in Chapter 5.
b) Perfect ground. Now we assume that the antenna is 3 m above a perfect ground plane
and run the simulation again to obtain Figure 6.17. This shows that the resonant frequency
is now shifted down to 14.25 MHz, and the input impedance at 14.5 MHz is changed to
42.87 + j31.02 ohms. The comparison of radiation patterns for both cases is presented in
Figure 6.18. The gain is increased from 2.11 dBi for free space to 8.58 dBi for this case.
Thus, the effects of the ground plane are signiﬁcant – it acts as a mirror to create another
antenna (image), forming a two-element dipole array. This array has increased the gain by a
factor of (not 2 but) about 4 (6.4 dB)! This is because the radiation pattern is changed from
omnidirectional to unidirectional in the H-plane (elevation). It may not look much like the
dipole patterns you may have seen (the textbook pictures usually show a dipole in free space),
but it is the kind of pattern seen in reality.
c) Real ground. If we choose the ‘real ground plane’, which has a conductivity of 0.005
S/m and relative permittivity of 13, the simulation results show that the resonant frequency
is around 14.35 MHz and the input impedance at 14.5 MHz is 61.74 + j14.65 ohms. The
radiation pattern is similar to Figure 6.18(b) and the gain is down to 5.38 dBi while the
HPBW is 110 degrees, which is the largest among these three cases. Thus, we can slightly
increase the length to 10.2 m (by trial and error) to make it resonate at 14 MHz with a
VSWR = 1.25.

238
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Figure 6.17
VSWR for a 10 m dipole 3 m above a perfect ground
The maximum direction of radiation is at θ = 0, but in practice the wave does not arrive
at that angle but more likely at around 45degrees, therefore we can change the height of the
antenna to tune the radiation pattern. This tuning process can be guided by the antenna array
theory introduced in Chapter 5, since the ground acts as a mirror and this becomes a two-
element antenna array. As shown in Figure 6.19, when the antenna is above the ground plane
by about half of the wavelength (z = 9 m in the ﬁgure), the 3 dB radiation pattern covers the
elevation angle roughly from 15 to 60 degrees, which matches well with our requirement. The
maximum gain is 6.15 dBi, which is larger than that of a quarter-wave monopole (5.15 dBi) –
here it can be considered an array.
Example 6.3: Monopole array. Two quarter-wave monopoles are separated by a quarter-
wavelength. They are placed above a perfect ground plane and fed with the same amplitude
and variable phase. Analyze how the phase difference in the feed affects the array performance
and compare with theoretical results.
Solution:
For convenience, we choose the frequency to be 300 MHz (so the wavelength is 1 m) and
assume the array is made of perfect conducting wire with a diameter of 2 mm. Each quarter-
wave monopole is divided into eight segments (< λ/20). There are now two sources placedat the

ends of the monopoles. A perfect ground is chosen as suggested. The EZNEC input interface
and the antenna plot with current distribution are shown in Figure 6.20.
Run the program for the initial phase difference ϕ0 = 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2 respectively
to obtain the radiation patterns and the input impedances (click on ‘SWR’). 3D and elevation
patterns at φ = 0 are shown in Figure 6.21 and the input impedances are given in Table 6.2. It
took just few minutes on a laptop computer to yield all these results, but it could take a much
longer time to obtain the theoretical results, especially when the mutual coupling is taken into
account.
It is apparent that the feed phase difference between the two monopoles affects both the
radiation pattern and input impedance signiﬁcantly. When the phase difference is 0◦(the

same as 360◦) or 180◦, the radiation pattern is symmetrical about the ZY plane and the two
impedances of the monopoles are the same but not 37 ohms, the self-impedance of a λ/4
monopole. In other cases, the pattern is not symmetrical and the two impedances are not the
same – these results might be a surprise to some people but they are real in practice. This is
further proof of how useful and important the simulation tool can be!

It is normally hard to ﬁnd an analytical solution to the input impedance of an antenna array,
but it could be relatively easy to obtain its radiation pattern. We are now going to derive the
radiation pattern using the array theory learnt in Section 5.3.
From Equation (5.104), the array factor for this two-element array can be expressed as
AFn = 1
2
sin(2/2)
sin(/2)

(6.39)
where = βd sin(π/2 −φ) + ϕ0 = π sin(π/2 −φ)/2 + ϕ0 at the azimuth plane, while  =
π sin(θ)/2 + ϕ0 at the elevation plane. Since the quarter-wave monopole antenna pattern is
known (using Equation (5.4) and letting 0 < θ < 90◦and also shown in Table 5.2), we can
employ the principle of pattern multiplication to obtain the monopole array pattern:
Eθ ∝

results presented in Figure 6.21. The only noticeable difference is that, at ϕ0 = 90◦, the electric
ﬁeld is zero in theory but very small (−30 dBi) from EZNEC for φ = 0◦and θ = 90◦; and
at ϕ0 = 270◦, we see the same difference for φ = 180◦and θ = −90◦. These differences can
be explained since, in the theoretical model, the currents on the monopoles are assumed to
be the same (as that of a standalone one), but they are not in reality (due to coupling), when
they are fed with phase differences (thus, the impedances are different, as shown in Table 6.2).
The numerical model has taken the difference into account and may therefore provide more
accurate results than the theoretical one with approximations/simpliﬁcations.
This type of software is not just limited to wire-type antennas and can also be used for much
more complicated simulations. For example, a helicopter simulation model is shown in Figure
6.23 [34], where the surface is replaced by wire meshes and each wire should be smaller than
λ/20. The computation could become a problem if the frequency of interest is too high. In such
a case, an alternative approach/software is required.
6.3.2 General Antenna Design and Analysis
Some relatively simple software packages (such as EZNEC) are cheap and very useful for wire-
type antenna analysis and design but they are not very suitable for dealing with antennas which
have complicated conﬁgurations and use various construction materials. More sophisticated
Figure 6.23

244
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
software packages (such as IE3D, CST Microwave Studio, MicroStripes, FEKO, XFDTD and
HFSS, more details can be found from their websites) are very powerful but not cheap. In this
section we are going to use Ansoft’s HFSS [36] as an example to design a dual-band patch
antenna for (GSM) mobile radio communications.
6.3.2.1 High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS)
HFSS utilizes a 3D full-wave ﬁnite element method (FEM) to compute the circuit and ﬁeld
behaviors of high-frequency and high-speed components. With HFSS, engineers can extract
circuit parameters (such as the impedance), visualize 3D electromagnetic ﬁelds (near and far
ﬁelds) and generate full-wave SPICETM models to evaluate signal quality effectively, including
transmission pathlosses, reﬂection loss due to impedance mismatches, parasitic coupling and
radiation. HFSS can be dynamically linked to other Ansoft software to create a powerful
electromagnetic-based design ﬂow and is one of the industrial standard antenna design software
packages. The major features include:
r suitability for almost all structures and conﬁgurations (wire or nonwire-types);
r all antenna results are given, and some animated results may also be shown;
r ease of optimizing the design (using its parametric function or Optimetrics software);
r good accuracy.
The software is user friendly and relatively easy to operate, but you need to have adequate
knowledge of setting up the simulation and interpreting the results. Most of all, you need to
have your design ready before simulation – the software does not do the design for you but
only helps you to validate and improve your design!
Figure 6.24 shows the user interface, which is basically divided into ﬁve main regions:
the project manager, the history tree, the property window, the 3D modeler window and the
progress window.
6.3.2.2 Design Examples
Now we are going to use the following example to illustrate how to use this software to aid
our antenna design.
Example 6.4: Dual-band GSM antenna. Planar inverted F antennas (PIFAs) have been widely
reported and are popular in mobile phones. The main reasons for this are: they are of low proﬁle;
their radiation patterns are near omnidirectional; they are installed above the phone circuitry,
‘reusing’ the space within the phone to some degree; they exhibit a low speciﬁc absorption
rate (and less loss to the head). The objective of this exercise is to design a dual-band PIFA
for a GSM mobile handset. It should cover 880–960 MHz (E-GSM 900) and 1710–1880 MHz
(DCS 1800 or GSM 1800). The dimensions should be small enough for a standard mobile
handset.
Solution:
PIFAs have evolved from the inverted F antenna, as shown in Figure 5.7. For an inverted F
antenna, the total length of the antenna should be close to a quarter-wavelength. In our case,
the two central frequencies are: 920 MHz (λ1 = 326 mm) and 1755 MHz (λ2 = 171 mm), we

therefore need to create two resonant paths on the antenna: one is about l1 = 81.5 mm and the
other is approximately l2 = 42.7 mm. After careful consideration, we decide to use a PIFA
antenna of dimensions 40 mm × 22 mm with a slot to create two current paths which are close
to l1 and l2 respectively, as shown in Figure 6.25. The detailed initial design is given in Figure
6.26. The PCB size is 40 mm × 100 mm.

It is almost impossible to use EZNEC to simulate such a structure. However, it is relatively
straightforward to employ software such as HFSS to model it. The step-by-step procedures of
using HFSS to simulate the antenna are:
1. Launch HFSS: you should see a schematic user interface as in Figure 6.24.
2. Set tool options and open a new project if required.
3. Create the 3D antenna model: this is the main part of entering your designed antenna. You
need to input the coordinates of every corner. The detailed dimensions are given in Figure
6.26.
4. Assign boundaries to all surfaces: there are many options, such as radiation, perfect E, and
perfect H.
5. Assign excitations: there are also many types, 50 ohm lumped port is selected for this
antenna analysis.
6. Set up an analysis: you need to select the solution frequency, frequency sweep if required
and the accuracy requirement and number of passes. For our simulation the frequency is set
from 800 MHz to 2000 MHz to cover the desired frequency range.
7. Validate the model: to check if there are any errors in the inputted model.
8. Start the simulation: the real-time progress report is shown in the progress window.
9. View solution data: you should view the convergence ﬁrst to see if the results have converged,
then create reports on various antenna parameters. If the results have not converged, more
iterations are required. The requirement on the computational power (memory and time)
could be excessive. This is a major and common problem for such a simulation.
For our design, the convergence plot is shown in Figure 6.27 and the results have converged
after eight iterations. The simulation used 250 MB memory and 320 MB disk space. The
return loss is illustrated by Figure 6.28. As expected, there are two resonant bands: one is
around 910 MHz and the other one is near 1750 MHz. Figure 6.29 shows the radiation pattern
at 1755 MHz, which is close to omnidirectional and has a gain/directivity of 4.358 dBi.

To further assist our analysis, we can plot other important information, such as the current
distribution at 1755 MHz on the plate, as shown in Figure 6.30 along with the ﬁnite element
meshes which were generated adaptively by the software. We can also obtain the animated
current/ﬁeld on the antenna. It is seen that the current is concentrated along the edge of the slot
and the pattern is a standing wave at 1755 MHz (resonant). This corresponds to the shorter
path identiﬁed in Figure 6.25.

The dual-band PIFA antenna with feed line and RF choke
For comparison, an antenna with the designed dimensions has been made, as shown in Figure
6.31. Due to the special driving point of this antenna, a microstrip line of 50 ohms is created
as its feed line, which is connected to an SMA connector. A quarter-wave choke is employed
to minimize the effects of the measurement cable. The transmission line that runs from the
central connector to the antenna driving point is de-embedded from the measured results. More
detailed information about this antenna can be found in [37] and general discussions on how
to make accurate antenna measurements are presented in the next chapter.
The simulated and measured impedances of this conﬁguration over the 800–1040 MHz
and 1610–2090 MHz bands are shown in Figure 6.32(a) and (b), respectively. Two measured
results are shown, which are based on the same conﬁguration and measured using the same
techniques to give an indication of the manufacturing tolerances involved.
The simulated and measured reﬂection coefﬁcients (S11) in dB are presented in Figure
6.33. For the resonant frequency, simulations and measurements tie up very well in the 800
MHz band. In the 1800 MHz band, differences in the resonant frequency of approximately
15 MHz are observed. At both frequency bands, the resonant frequency simulation accuracy
is thought to be of the same order as the manufacturing accuracy. Some phase rotation is
apparent at both the 800 MHz band and, to a lesser degree, the 1800 MHz band. The 1800
MHz measurements have a noticeably higher resistance than the simulations, although this is
not observed at GSM. It is expected that manufacturing accuracy can be improved in future
work. Residual differences between simulations and measurements are then expected to depend
on de-embedding inaccuracies and simulation errors.
There are many other useful functions which may be employed to aid our design. For
example, the design for Example 6.4 does not completely meet the industrial return-loss
requirement (> 6 dB) over the 1800 MHz band. Fine tuning is required: this can be achieved

6.4 Summary
In this chapter we have introduced the computational electromagnetic techniques used in
modern antenna design. The focus has been placed on the MoM, which gave us insight into
how a complex ﬁeld equation could be solved numerically and how to obtain the desired
antenna parameters. Two software packages have been employed as examples to illustrate how
they can be utilized for antenna design and analysis.

Antenna Manufacturing
and Measurements
Once an antenna is designed, it should be made and tested. The construction of an antenna may
be a complex process since the antenna has to meet the electrical and mechanical speciﬁcations
as well as some other requirements (such as costs). In this chapter we are going to see which
materials are normally employed to make antennas, what antenna measurements should be
conducted and how.
7.1 Antenna Manufacturing
From a construction point of view, antennas (such as dipoles, loops and horns) are normally
manufactured using conducting materials, low-loss dielectric materials (e.g. dielectric resonant
antennas) or a combination of both (e.g. patch antennas). The selection of the right material
and a robust construction are important elements in making a successful antenna.
7.1.1 Conducting Materials
Conducting materials are the most widely used to build antennas. In principle, all conductive
materials can be employed, but the antenna efﬁciency is closely linked to the conductivity of
the material: the higher the conductivity, the higher the efﬁciency. Thus, in practice, we only
choose materials with very good conductivity.
In addition to the conductivity, we have to take other things into account, which include the
following aspects:
r Mechanical considerations: the material should be strong enough to keep its desired shape
under normal working conditions.
r Environmental considerations: the material should be resilient to environmental changes –
for example, it should not oxidize or erode – in order to maintain its good conductivity.
Sometimes, a layer of paint is applied to meet this requirement. The paint may affect the
antenna performance, so a trade-off is necessary.

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
r Cost considerations: as for any other product, the cost of antenna manufacture should be
kept to a minimum.
r Weight consideration: it should normally be as light as possible.
As a result, copper, brass (an alloy of copper and zinc), bronze (an alloy of copper and tin)
and aluminum are widely used to make antennas. Composite materials are also employed for
constructing antennas. For example, polycarbonate/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (PC/ABS)
alloys are widely used for making mobile phone antennas. They combine the excellent
heat resistance of polycarbonate with the improved processibility of ABS. The conduc-
tivities of some common metals used in antenna construction are given in Table 1.3
in Chapter 1.
To construct prototype antennas (especially those of special shapes) at home or in a lab,
metallic tapes or even aluminum foils (from a supermarket) may be employed, since they are
conductive, very ﬂexible and cheap. However, it is necessary to ensure that the metal thickness
is much greater than the skin depth of the material at the desired frequency. A discussion on
skin depth was provided in Section 3.6.1.
One of the most overlooked antenna construction considerations is the galvanic corrosion
that usually occurs when two dissimilar metals are brought into physical contact (mated)
during the assembly process and exposed to the weather. There can be serious corrosion at their
respective contact points. There is a direct relationship between various types of dissimilar
metals when they are mated. Some dissimilar metals (such as copper and brass) when mated
cause very little corrosion. There are other metals, however, that react most harshly when
mated. Zinc and brass, for example, will cause corrosion, with the zinc metal quickly breaking
down. There are several ways of reducing and preventing this form of corrosion. One of them
is to electrically insulate the two metals from each other. This can be done using plastic or
another insulator to separate the metals. Use of absorbent washers that may retain ﬂuid is often
counter-productive. Sometimes they have to be in electrical contact, the best solution is to use
the same metal throughout the construction. If this is not possible, the next course of action
is to assemble materials that have a close relationship on a galvanic metals table, as shown
in Table 7.1.

7.1.2 Dielectric Materials
Dielectric materials are employed to form the desired antenna shape (a conductor may be inside
the dielectric or the dielectric may be covered by a conductor/composite material), to protect
a metal antenna or to act as a dielectric antenna. The dielectric properties of the materials that
are commonly used in antenna design are given in Table 1.2 and Table 2.4 (PCB substrates).
Dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) are a relatively new type of antenna that have some
attractive properties and have become more widely used due to the availability of low-loss and
high-permittivity materials [1–3]. The typical relative permittivity is from 10 to 100. Because of
the discontinuity between the dielectric and air, DRAs act as resonators whose resonant mode
is excited by a specially designed feeding method. The coupling of power to the structure
can be achieved using coaxial probes, microstrip or coplanar transmission lines. Dielectric
resonators of any shape may be used for antenna design. The shape and dielectric properties of
the dielectric along with the frequency and excitation determine which resonant mode may be
generated, hence the radiation pattern and input impedance. The widely used geometries are
rectangles, cylinders, rings and hemispheres. DRAs offer a number of good features, including
small size and reasonable bandwidth. The use of low-loss materials and small conductor losses
permits high radiation efﬁciencies. Unlike conductive antennas, the inﬂuence of nearby objects
(such as human hands) has a limited effect on the performance of a DRA, which is one of the
major reasons for DRAs becoming popular in some portable devices.
It should be pointed out that there is normally a trade-off between the antenna size and
its bandwidth. The smaller the size (which means a larger permittivity), the narrower the
bandwidth. This result is applicable not only to DRAs but also other antennas, such as patch
antennas – a high permittivity substrate is required if the antenna has to be made small.
From the antenna design point of view, the main requirement on materials for coating and
protection purposes is low loss (in addition to other requirements), which affects the antenna ef-
ﬁciency andinputimpedance.Anothernoticeableeffectofthedielectricmaterialontheantenna
is that the resonant frequency is shifted downwards, which will be demonstrated in Section 7.3.
7.1.3 New Materials for Antennas
Antenna evolution has been heavily inﬂuenced by the materials industry. PCBs are commonly
used for making planar antennas. There is a trend to integrate antennas with an RF front-
end and circuits. Thus, the development of PCBs has an impact on antenna manufacturing.
Liquid crystal polymer (LCP) material provides an alternative to traditional polyimide ﬁlm
for use as a substrate in ﬂexible circuit construction. This development offers improvements
in manufacturing and processing of LCP ﬂexible circuits and antennas. LCP ﬁlm is directly
metalized using a vacuum sputtering process. Unlike laminated substrates, the sputtered LCP
substrate yields a good metal-to-LCP adhesion, avoids trace line undercut problems, eliminates
remaining copper issues and provides effective circuit-patterning resolution. Either subtractive
or additive processing can be employed, which is good for antenna applications. It has good
thermoplastic properties with a low dielectric constant and loss factor remaining constant over
the frequency range of 1 kHz to 45 GHz, with a negligible moisture effect. The properties of
multilayer (three-dimensional) vertical integration capability, good electrical and mechanical
properties and near-hermetic nature make this substrate a practical choice for the design of
low-cost antennas [4].

256
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
More recently, some new materials and processes have been developed. Silver inks and
deposited coppers are employed for making small and lightweight antennas for applications
such as RFID [5]. Electrically conductive adhesives are replacing conventional soldering.
Artiﬁcial materials have been developed and provide some unique features. For example,
the reﬂection coefﬁcient on a high impedance surface structure can be 1 (not −1 as on a
good conductor). Some new antennas of low proﬁle and high gain using these new materials
are emerging [6, 7, 8]. Although it is quite unlikely that they will become popular for all
applications, they do provide opportunities for people to use these materials to design new
antennas for some special applications.
7.2 Antenna Measurement Basics
Once an antenna is designed and constructed, it is essential to validate the design with
proper measurements, a crucial element of the development process. The most important
measurements are the impedance and radiation pattern measurements, since they are the most
important characteristics of an antenna. The input impedance may be speciﬁed as a value at a
particular frequency and/or as a maximum VSWR or return loss over a range of frequencies
(often referred to 50 ohms). The measurement is relatively straightforward. However, the ra-
diation measurement is much more complicated and time-consuming. Typical measurements
are the radiation pattern and gain measurements, which should be performed in an antenna
test range. The radiation patterns of some antennas (such as those for radar, microwave links,
some cellular base stations and satellites) are highly directional and often have tightly speciﬁed
envelopes. Not only will the peak gain be speciﬁed, but challenging requirements might also
be placed on parameters such as polarization purity (axial ratio), side lobe levels and efﬁciency.
The testing and evaluation of some of these parameters may be difﬁcult. Details of impedance
measurements are given in Section 7.3. Details of radiation measurements are given in Section
7.4. Some other measurement issues are discussed in Section 7.5.
7.2.1 Scattering Parameters
In previous chapters we deﬁned and used the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients for both
the circuit and ﬁeld problem analyses. These concepts can be generalized for network analysis.
A two-port network problem can be illustrated by Figure 7.1, where a1 and a2 are the input
whilst b1 and b2 are the output at Port 1 and Port 2, respectively. This network is characterized
by scattering parameters, or S-parameters:

(7.2)
Thus, we have:
S11 = Port 1 reﬂection coefﬁcient = b1/a1;
S12 = Port 2 to Port 1 transmission coefﬁcient/gain = b1/a2;
S21 = Port 1 to Port 2 transmission coefﬁcient/gain = b2/a1;
S22 = Port 2 reﬂection coefﬁcient = b2/a2.
(7.3)
S-parameters are actually reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients for a network of N ports. In
this case, N = 2. These parameters were originally introduced in optics, where optical waves
were scattered by objects. The concepts were later extended to radio waves and RF engineering,
but the term ‘S-parameters’ has remained unchanged.
It should be pointed out that if a network is passive and contains only isotropic and loss-free
materials that inﬂuence the transmitted signal, the network will obey
r the reciprocity principle, which means S21 = S12 or more generally Smn = Snm, and
r the law of power conservation
[S]H [S] = [I]
(7.4)
where [S]H is the complex conjugate transpose of the S-parameter matrix [S] and [I] is the
identity/unit matrix. For a 2-port loss-free network, we have
|S11|2 + |S21|2 = 1
|S22|2 + |S12|2 = 1
(7.5)
which is equivalent to
|a1|2 + |a2|2 = |b1|2 + |b2|2
(7.6)
The input power is the same as the output power, as expected.
Almost all antennas, attenuators, cables, splitters and combiners are reciprocal (but maybe
not loss-free) networks. The networks which include anisotropic materials in the transmission
medium, such as those containing ferrite components, will be nonreciprocal. Although it
doesn’t necessarily contain ferrites, an ampliﬁer is also an example of a nonreciprocal network.
Now the question is how are S-parameters linked to antennas? From Figure 7.2, we can
clearly see that a transmitting-receiving antenna system in the space can be considered a 2-port
network. The transmission and reﬂection can be characterized using S-parameters. S11 and S22
are the reﬂection coefﬁcients of Antenna 1 and Antenna 2, respectively. They indicate how well
the antenna feed line is matched with the antenna. S21 and S12 are the transmission coefﬁcients
from one antenna to another. They are determined by the characteristics of both antennas (such

as radiation patterns and matching) and the separation between them. It should be pointed out
that this equivalent network is not a conﬁned 2-port network but a lossy open network, since
the power radiated from one antenna is not all received by another antenna, thus the conditions
in Equations (7.5) and (7.6) do not hold for such an antenna network. However, the reciprocity
principle can still be applied to this case.
7.2.2 Network Analyzers
For RF/microwave engineering, the oscilloscope is often employed to view signals in the time
domain while the spectrum analyzer is used to examine signals in the frequency domain.
For antenna measurements, the most useful and important piece of equipment is the network
analyzer (NA), which is basically a combination of a transmitter and a receiver. Normally it has
two ports and the signal can be generated or received from either port. The main parameters it
measures are the S-parameters, i.e. it measures the reﬂection and transmission characteristics
of a network. There are two types of network analyzer:
r the scalar network analyzer (SNA) measures the amplitude of the parameters of a network,
such as VSWR, return loss, gain and insertion loss;
r the vector network analyzer (VNA) measures both the amplitude and phase of the parameters
of a network.
The VNA is much more powerful than the SNA; in addition to the parameters which can
be measured by the SNA, it can also measure some very important parameters such as the
complex impedance, which is essential for antenna measurements. Thus, we need a VNA not
an SNA for antenna measurements.
7.2.2.1 The Conﬁguration of a VNA
A typical VNA is shown in Figure 7.3. It can be seen that the equipment comes with two
standard coaxial connectors. The measured results can be saved to a disk or a computer via a
USB port at the back. The architecture of a VNA is given in Figure 7.4. This clearly shows that
the source signal can be transmitted from either Port 1 or Port 2 to the device under test (DUT),
which is controlled by a switch. A part of the signal from the source is provided directly to the
reference R, which will be compared with the received signal A (from Port 1) or B (from Port
2) by the central processing unit (CPU).
VNAs can perform most of the necessary measurements without the need for any manual
tuning. Just as importantly, they also contain integrated computers and graphical displays,

which allow an unprecedented level of data manipulation and display – for example, making
it possible to plot calibrated, phase-adjusted impedances directly onto an on-screen Smith
Chart. Indeed, network analyzers now have most of the features of typical personal computers:
high levels of processing power, high-resolution colour screens, familiar operating systems,
network connections, etc. Furthermore, most network analyzers support the standardized ﬁle
formats that are used by circuit simulators, allowing measurements to be performed and then
imported into simulations of the system in which the antennas operate.

7.2.2.2 What Can a VNA be Used to Measure?
The VNA is frequency-domain equipment; it can obtain the signal in the time domain using
Fourier transforms. For example, it can be used as a time-domain reﬂectometer (TDR) to
identify discontinuities of an antenna, a transmission line or a circuit. For antenna measure-
ments, the typical parameters that can be measured by a VNA include:
Transmission measurements:
r gain (dB)
r insertion loss (dB)
r insertion phase (degrees)
r transmission coefﬁcients (S12, S21)
r electrical length (m)
r electrical delay (s)
r deviation from linear phase (degrees)
r group delay (s)
Reﬂection measurements:
r return loss (dB)
r reﬂection coefﬁcients (S11, S22)
r reﬂection coefﬁcients vs distance (Fourier transform)
r impedance (R + j X), which can be displayed on the Smith Chart
r VSWR
Note these parameters can be displayed on the VNA screen. However, when the data are
exported to a computer or saved to a disk, we normally get the complex S11at each sampling
frequency.
It should also be pointed out that, although the VNA can be viewed as the combination of
a transmitter and a receiver, the received signal is not displayed as its absolute but a relative
value, which is different from a conventional receiver. Thus, the VNA cannot normally be used
as a receiver or spectrum analyzer.
7.2.2.3 Calibration and Measurement Errors
WhenusingaVNAtoperformantennameasurements,acarefulcalibrationhastobeconducted.
The reasons are:
r As a radiator, the antenna should not be placed too close to the VNA (to avoid coupling
and interference), that is, it should not be directly connected to the VNA. Thus, a cable and
connectors have to be used.
r The cable and connectors introduce attenuation and a phase shift.
r The reading on the VNA is at the default reference plane, but what we want to measure is
the reading at the input port of the antenna.
We therefore need to remove the effects of the cable and connectors and shift the mea-
surement reference plane right to the end of the cable – this process is called calibration.
The standard calibration needs three terminations for one-port calibration, i.e. short, open and
load/matched. The commonly used calibration for a 2-port network is short-open-load-thru

Antenna Manufacturing and Measurements
261
(SOLT) calibration. Other calibration methods, such as thru-reﬂection-line (TRL) calibration
[9], short-open-load-reciprocal element (SOLR) and line-reﬂection-match (LRM, the best cal-
ibration accuracy up to 110 GHz) are also used in practice.
There are various errors that may be introduced into the measurement. The well-known ones
include system errors, random errors and drift errors. Because of the radiating nature of the
antenna, antenna measurements have many other possible sources of error. The system errors
can be removed by calibration. Some errors (such as random error) cannot be eliminated. Just
like simulation results, measured results are also approximations.
7.3 Impedance, S11, VSWR and Return Loss Measurement
Up until approximately the late 1980s, most impedance measurements were performed with
manually tuned impedance bridges. Such bridges are still used today – for example, operating
impedance bridges are used for measurements of AM broadcast antennas due to their ability
to be connected ‘in line’ whilst high powers are transmitted by the antenna. However, for
laboratory use, the VNA has become the industry standard equipment for high-frequency
(distributed element) impedance measurements and it is very different from the multimeter
used for DC and low-frequency (lumped element) impedance measurements.
From the circuit theory provided in Chapter 2, we know that the load impedance and the
transmission line impedance determine the reﬂection coefﬁcient, VSWR and return loss. Since
the line impedance for the VNA is normally set at 50 ohms, the antenna impedance, S11
(deﬁned by Equation (7.3)), and return loss measurements are basically the same when a VNA
is employed. We just need to measure S11 (a complex number) at one port where the antenna
under test (AUT) is connected. The standard measurement procedures are:
r Select a suitable cable (low loss and phase stable) for the measurement and ensure that it is
properly connected to the VNA (otherwise a signiﬁcant error could be generated) – this is a
major source of measurement error.
r Select the measurement frequency range and suitable number of measurement points over
the frequency.
r Perform the one-port calibration and ensure that the cable is not moved (or errors could be
generated).
r Conduct the measurements in an environment with little reﬂection (such as an open area or
an anechoic chamber – to be discussed in Section 7.4.2).
r Record the measured results.
7.3.1 Can I Measure These Parameters in My Ofﬁce?
In practice, many people perform this measurement in a standard lab or ofﬁce – this is ﬁne
provided that the antenna is not very directional and the signal reﬂected may be considered
small. The most sensitive frequency band is around the resonance. For a very directional
antenna, one may point the antenna toward a RAM (radio absorbing material) to reduce the
reﬂection.
Let us take the dual-band PIFA antenna designed in Example 6.4 as an example. A com-
parison of the simulated and measured results was provided in Chapter 6. Here the measured
S11 (in dB) in an ofﬁce (dashed line) and in an anechoic chamber (solid line) are shown in

directivity of this antenna is small. The only noticeable difference is indeed around the two
resonant frequencies (the two troughs).
7.3.2 Effects of a Small Section of a Transmission Line or a Connector
In order to make measurements, very often we have to use a connector and probably a small
section of a transmission line that cannot be included in the calibration. As a result, they may
introduce errors to the measured results. Their effects are more signiﬁcant on the impedance
than on the VSWR and return loss. This is because the impedance is a complex number and
is sensitive to a length change of the line, while the VSWR and return loss are scalar and not
sensitive to a length change.
7.3.3 Effects of Packages on Antennas
The effects of a ground plane and the installation on antennas were discussed earlier and it was
concluded that both the impedance and radiation pattern might be affected. Here we use the
dual-band PIFA antenna again as an example to illustrate how the package shown in Figure 7.6
may affect the antenna resonance. The package case is made of a plastic material with low
loss over the frequency range of interest. The measured results of S11 in dB for the antenna
with (solid line) and without (dashed line) the package case are shown in Figure 7.7, which
is from 0.7 to 1.2 GHz for the GSM 900 band. It is apparent that the resonant frequency is
shifted down from 0.965 to about 0.905 GHz, which is quite considerable. Thus, its package
and installation must be taken into account when the antenna is designed.

7.4 Radiation Pattern Measurements
As one of the most important parameters, the radiation pattern has to be measured once
an antenna is developed, which is a much more difﬁcult and time-consuming task than the
impedance measurement. There are a few methods of measuring antenna radiation patterns.
They can be classiﬁed as near-ﬁeld and far-ﬁeld measurement methods, or frequency domain

and time domain methods [10–14]. Which method is chosen depends primarily on the antenna
size and location. For example, medium wave broadcast antennas are installed on steel towers.
It is possible to measure in the hemisphere above the ground, but a helicopter or hot-air
balloon would be required to do so: normally this would be prohibitively expensive. Instead,
measurements are normally performed on the ground along ‘radials’ that emanate at the antenna
phase center and extend outwards (with chosen angle increments) for a few tens of kilometers.
Measurements are made at various distances along these radials (at points where access to
land is allowed) and radiation patterns are calculated from these measurements, where possible
makingallowancesfortheconductivityoftheground.Thisissomethingofanextremeexample,
but it illustrates that the method of antenna measurement can be very speciﬁc to a particular
antenna type. In this section we will only deal with some common pattern measurement
methods, focusing on some of the most widespread applications.
7.4.1 Far-Field Condition
Antenna pattern measurements are usually performed in the far ﬁeld: deﬁned, somewhat nom-
inally, as the separation required between source and test antenna such that the phase variation
of the wave front across the aperture of the test antenna is less than π/8 radians (22.5 degrees),
as illustrated in Figure 7.8. In addition to the AUT, a source antenna is required to generate the
far ﬁeld.
Referring to Figure 7.8, it is clear that the circular wave front from the phase center of the
source antenna gives rise to a phase variation across the aperture of the test antenna, of width

λ
(7.9)
It is very important to note:
r As discussed in Section 3.1.1, Equation (7.9) is for electrically large antennas. For smaller
antennas, l > 3λ is also required.
r When the antenna is rotated, the distance from one end to the source varies from l + D/2
to l −D/2. The 1/r ﬁeld dependence due to this rotation can give rise to pattern errors. If a
±0.5 dB amplitude error is acceptable then l > 10D is required.
7.4.2 Open-Area Test Sites (OATS)
Open-area test sites (OATS) are, as the name suggests, outdoor sites where no reﬂectors, other
than the ground, are present over a relatively wide area. The most attractive advantage of OATS
is the low cost. A typical site is illustrated in Figure 7.9.
It can be seen from Figure 7.9 that the path difference between the direct and reﬂected waves
is

If we assume that l ≫(hT + h R), we can neglect the distance-dependent amplitude differ-
ences between the two waves and assume that both the direct and reﬂected components travel
over the distance l. We must, however, account for amplitude and phase differences due to the
reﬂection coefﬁcient of the ground. Since the phase term of the wave is e jβ·r, the signal at the
receiver is given by
E = ED

Obviously, if the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the ground is not zero, the received power at a
ﬁxed distance l is not uniform. For example, if it is a metal ground plane, the horizontal and
vertical reﬂection coefﬁcients approach –1. This gives

(7.16)
When λl ≫2πhT h R, this equation can be further simpliﬁed to Equation (3.45) – the two-ray
model result. But, generally speaking, the received power is a periodic function of hT h R as a
periodic function. With the presence of ground reﬂection, the power at the AUT is sensitive to
the heights of transmit and receive antennas, their separation and the wavelength. The ﬁeld is
not suitable for pattern measurements. Thus, it is very important to minimize the reﬂection from
the ground plane by raising the antenna height or placing RF-absorbing materials (RAM – more
details to follow in the next section) between the two antennas to allow accurate measurements.
There are other issues to be considered when using OATS. For example, the site must be
located in a place where the ambient level of RF interference is low. This is increasingly

Antenna Manufacturing and Measurements
267
difﬁcult due to the density of wireless communications systems and locating a site in a remote
area (in terms of radio coverage) causes logistical problems associated with the transport of
devices and personnel. Since OATS are outdoors, testing time is limited by daylight hours and
weather conditions. In some countries there is very little daylight during cold winters; often
such seasonal variations are inconsistent with business requirements. To counter the problems
associated with testing time, measures may be taken to extend the number and duration of
operational days. However, weather shields, lighting (and the associated cables) and heating
systems are potential sources of reﬂections and interference.
7.4.3 Anechoic Chambers
Anechoic chambers were developed so that antenna engineers could enjoy the convenience
and productivity of being able to perform measurements indoors. The main obstacle to this is
that ‘indoors’ implies ‘within walls’ and the walls reﬂect antenna signals and, hence, distort
radiation pattern measurements. The term anechoic simply means without echoes: measures
are taken – usually using RAM – to prevent reﬂections from the walls, ceiling and ﬂoor. In
addition, the walls are usually metalized to prevent external interference from entering the
measurement room. A typical anechoic chamber is illustrated in Figure 7.10.
The chamber consists of a metallic room with a source antenna at one end that is used to
excite an AUT at the other end. The antenna under test is usually mounted on a positioner
(or turntable) that is rotated in the azimuth plane (the x −y plane in Figure 7.10) to obtain
a two-dimensional radiation pattern. Some chambers may be equipped with positioners that
are also capable of movement, or tilt, in the elevation plane, whilst others may have so-called
roll over azimuth positioners in which the AUT rotates orthogonally to the azimuth rotation,
allowing measurement of the full 3D radiation pattern. The source antenna may be rotated
about its axis for polarization measurements. The chamber is usually arranged to transmit
from the source antenna and receive on the AUT, although this may be reversed if it is more
convenient (the reciprocity principle). The turntable positioner, plotter, receiver and transmit
source are all under computer control.
Some chambers are rectangular in shape; some chambers are tapered from the source to the
AUT to prevent the formation of standing waves and to make the wave front incident on the
AUT more planar, increasing the effective chamber length.

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Radiation pattern measurement accuracy is limited by the ﬁnite reﬂectivity of the chamber
walls, the positioner and the cables that are used to feed the AUT. Multiple reﬂections ‘ﬁll-in’
nulls in the radiation pattern and create false side lobes. The shape of the room is designed
to minimize reﬂections from the walls over a wide range of incident angles and frequencies.
The lowest frequency of operation is determined by the length of the absorber – typically the
absorber needs to be approximately one wavelength long at the lower end of the operational
range. At 300 MHz – the lower end of the UHF band – this corresponds to one meter, which
is too large for installations in normal commercial buildings. The upper end of the frequency
range is determined by the composition of the absorbers and their surfaces. Most RAM is made
of carbon-loaded polyurethane foam (for the resistivity and reduced weight). Pyramids and
wedges are widely used shapes. Pyramids work best at normal incident. A tapered impedance
transition from the free space to the back of the absorber ensures broadband-absorbing
performance.
The dynamic range of an antenna chamber is limited by the source transmit power and
receiver sensitivity. This is not a serious limitation provided the signal is detected in a narrow
bandwidth and a wide dynamic range low-noise ampliﬁer is used at the test antenna. Often a
network analyzer can be used, perhaps with an additional transmit ampliﬁer.
At low frequencies (< 1 GHz, say) an open test range would normally be used. This is
because any chamber would need to be very long to operate in the far ﬁeld and, also, a large
volume of RAM would be needed, since the RAM depth should be a couple of meters or more
for low frequencies. However, some very large chambers exist that are capable of operation
at lower frequencies and near-ﬁeld measurements can also be used to reduce the measurable
frequency of indoor systems.
Anechoic chambers can be used to measure antenna radiation either in the near or far ﬁelds.
Near-ﬁeld measurements are dealt with in the following two sections.
7.4.3.1 An Example of an Anechoic Chamber
A picture of an anechoic chamber at the University of Liverpool is shown in Figure 7.11.
The chamber has dimensions of 6.0 m × 3.5 m × 3 m and most of the RAM has a length
of 300 mm for frequencies from 1 GHz to 40 GHz with a return loss > 40 dB. The source
antenna is a broadband double-ridged horn antenna, and the quiet AUT area is about 0.5 m ×
0.5 m × 0.5 m for an antenna separation of 3 m, which is suitable for the measurement of
most mobile radio antennas. The system set-up is given in Figure 7.12; a VNA is used as
the transmitter and receiver. A computer-controlled turntable/positioner (which has two step
motors for azimuth and elevation controls) is connected to a controller via an optical link (to
minimize measurement errors). This automatic measurement system and its software were
developed by Diamond Engineering [15] at a very reasonable price, which is particularly
suitable for small antenna measurements.
7.4.4 Compact Antenna Test Ranges (CATR)
For some electrically large antennas, the far-ﬁeld distance given in Equation (7.9) is too large
for a conventional anechoic chamber or even an OATS; a possible solution is to utilize a
compact antenna test range (CATR) to generate a plane-wave-like uniform AUT area. The

An example of an anechoic chamber
idea of CATR is simple: just replace the source antenna by a large offset parabolic reﬂector
antenna (as discussed in Section 5.2.3) in a conventional anechoic chamber or RATS. The AUT
should be smaller than the reﬂector. It has been reported that quiet zones encompassing 50%
of the reﬂector width can be accomplished. More details can be found in [13, 16].

Planar near-ﬁeld chamber
7.4.5 Planar and Cylindrical Near-Field Chambers
Planar and cylindrical near-ﬁeld chambers are particularly useful for measuring aperture an-
tennas and arrays. The former, shown schematically in Figure 7.13, is best at measuring planar
arrays (with many elements in the x and y dimensions), particularly those with a reﬂector for
unidirectional radiation. The latter is best for measuring arrays with more elements in the y
than the x dimension and with omnidirectional radiation in the azimuth plane.
The system shown in Figure 7.13 operates by moving a measurement antenna – or probe –
across a plane close to and extending beyond the aperture of the antenna. The spacing between
this plane and the antenna under test is large enough to prevent mutual interaction with the
probe, but small enough to allow a compact system. The probe scans in the antenna near ﬁeld
and a mathematical transformation is applied to give far-ﬁeld radiation patterns.
7.4.6 Spherical Near-Field Chambers
Spherical near-ﬁeld chambers have the advantage of measuring the entire ﬁeld around the
antenna: this allows the total power emanating from the antenna to be measured and, hence,
the efﬁciency calculated. This makes such systems particularly suitable for the measurement
of handset antennas, where efﬁciency is especially important (since handset antennas operate
in a multipath environment, receiving signals from all directions, the gain in any one of these
directions is relatively unimportant, since an averaging effect generally occurs).
Spherical near-ﬁeld measurement systems generally fall into two categories: swinging-arm
systems and ﬁxed-probe systems. Swinging-arm systems are less complicated electrically

Antenna Manufacturing and Measurements
271
than ﬁxed-probe systems, but are slower due to the mechanical movement that is necessary.
Probe-based systems have been made possible (at a competitive cost) due to the computational
power of modern computers. This allows each probe to be compensated digitally every time a
measurement is made (for all angles and frequencies).
A typical commercial system is shown in Figure 7.14. The chamber is large enough that it
is possible to do measurements of handset antennas with the complete system present – i.e.
the phone and the user. The scanning method is fast enough to allow users to stay still for
the duration of the measurement (measurement of the full sphere at an angular resolution of
approximately 5 degrees with 20 frequency points is possible in approximately 3 minutes).
The system consists of a circular array of dual-polarized wideband measurement probes
(visible as crosses in Figure 7.14), for elevation measurement and a rotating turntable for
azimuth measurement. The diameter of the circle of probes is approximately 3.2 m. This,
combined with the near-ﬁeld measurement technique, allows measurement of large radiating
structures. The speed of the system is attributed to the method used to switch between probes.
The method is termed the modulated scattering technique: each probe is modulated ‘on’ while
all others are modulated ‘off’. All of the probes are connected via a passive combining network

toanRFunit,whichthenseparatesthe‘on’probefromthe‘off’probesinthefrequencydomain.
This process allows the probes to be sequentially scanned very quickly, without the need for
discrete switches.
The system shown operates from 450 MHz – 6 GHz without the need to replace any parts
(as is the case for conventional near-ﬁeld chambers, where the probes have a limited frequency
range). More information about this kind of system can be found in Section 7.6.4.
7.5 Gain Measurements
There are several methods of measuring the absolute gain of an antenna, these are discussed
below.
7.5.1 Comparison with a Standard-Gain Horn
The signal obtained from the AUT is compared with that from an antenna of known gain, such
as a standard-gain horn, with constant power transmitted from the source antenna. The gain of
the antenna under test, G AUT , is given by
G AUT = PAUT
PSG
GSG
(7.17)
where PAUT and PSG are the powers accepted by the antenna under test and the standard
gain antenna respectively (allowing for mismatches) and where GSG is the known gain of the
standard-gain horn. The advantage of this method is that it does not rely on knowledge of the
pathloss due to the spacing between the source and test antennas in the chamber. Accuracy is
determined by the positioning of the AUT and standard-gain antennas and the calibration of
the standard-gain horn. It is difﬁcult and expensive to measure the absolute gain of standard-
gain horns to within a few tenths of a dB. In three-dimensional chambers, the directivity of
the standard-gain horn can be measured (via radiation pattern integration) and assumed to be
equal to the gain for horns with a metal-only construction (the losses are very low, so the horn
can be assumed to be 100% efﬁcient).
7.5.2 Two-Antenna Measurement
This relies on knowledge of the chamber pathloss, L, given by (see Section 3.5.1)
L =

 λ
4π l
2
(7.18)
where λ is the wavelength and l is the separation between the source and test antennas. If the
gains of the source and test antennas are denoted by GS and G AUT respectively, the power
received by the latter is given by
PAUT = LGS PSG AUT
(7.19)

Antenna Manufacturing and Measurements
273
where PS is the source antenna power. This equation is the same as Equation (3.42). If the
gain of the source antenna is not known, then identical test antennas may be used at both the
source and receive end of the chamber to establish their gain. Alternatively, the return signal
from a single test antenna facing a large conducting sheet may be used to measure its gain (the
effective chamber length being twice the separation of the antenna and sheet). In this case, it
is important that the inherent mismatch of the test antenna is allowed for.
7.5.3 Three-Antenna Measurement
If three antennas of unknown gains G1, G2 and G3 are used as source and test antennas in all
three possible combinations, denoting the source power by PS, the received powers are
P12 = PSLG1G2
P23 = PSLG2G3
P13 = PSLG1G3
(7.20)
Thus, there are three equations in three unknowns so that all three gains may be established.
These equations may be easily solved, giving
G1 = P12P13
P23PSL
G2 = P12P23
P13PSL
G3 = P23P13
P12PSL
(7.21)
As for the two-antenna measurement, this method does not rely on the use of a standard-gain
antenna, but does require knowledge of the pathloss between the source and test ends of the
chamber.
7.6 Miscellaneous Topics
Antenna measurements are actually a very important and active subject. It is difﬁcult to
make accurate radiation measurements since there are many possible sources of error. In
this section we are going to discuss some of the techniques and latest developments in antenna
measurements.
7.6.1 Efﬁciency Measurements
The antenna efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio of the directivity to the gain of an antenna
and can also be determined by the radiation resistance and loss resistance, as shown in

274
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Equation (4.40), i.e.
ηe = Pt
Pin
=
Rr
Rr + RL
(7.22)
Thus, the efﬁciency can be obtained by measuring either the directivity and gain or the radiation
resistance and loss resistance.
The antenna gain measurements were discussed in Section 7.5. The directivity is often
computed based on the integration of the power pattern or based on the half-power beamwidth,
as discussed in Section 4.1.2. This directivity/gain method is difﬁcult to realize with precision
in practice, since the full 3D radiation pattern is required and the estimated directivity is not
accurate enough.
The Wheeler cap method, which was originally proposed by Wheeler [17], is a popular
alternative method. It measures the radiation and loss resistances of the antenna. The idea is
to place the AUT inside a small nonresonant metal shield (cap) to prevent its radiation, which
is large enough not to disturb the current on the antenna. Thus, the real part of the measured
input impedance should be the loss resistance of the antenna. The real part of the antenna
impedance (radiation resistance and loss resistance) can be measured in an anechoic chamber
or OATS. Once the loss resistance and the real part of the input impedance are known, we
can use Equation (7.22) to calculate the efﬁciency. There are no speciﬁc limits on the cap
size although the originally recommended radius of the cap should be around λvyπ, but the
AUT size is limited approximately to λ/4 [18]. This has been widely used for mobile antenna
efﬁciency measurement [19].
7.6.2 Reverberation Chambers
Reverberation chambers, which are electrically large metallic chambers with stirrers to gen-
erate a random ﬁeld, have been used for EMC measurements for many years (for radiated
emission and immunity tests) [20] and, from around the year 2000, have also been applied
to the measurement of mobile phones. The advantage of this method is that the chamber
can be relatively small and cheap (an absorber is not required) and a large ﬁeld strength can
be generated with limited power. The principle of reverberation chambers is illustrated in
Figure 7.15.
The chamber itself is essentially a metal box with a source antenna that is used to set
up a ﬁeld distribution within it. An antenna under test (AUT) is placed in an approximately
central location. Mode stirrers – large metallic plates or paddles that are articulated by mo-
tors – are used to randomize the ﬁeld received by the AUT, i.e. it is as if waves arrive with
equal probability from all angles. Both polarizations are also equally likely and the ﬁeld is
uniform on average away from the chamber walls. This is a reasonable approximation of
the multipath ﬁeld that is typically experienced by a mobile phone. Hence, it can be used to
measure antenna diversity gain and characterize multiple-in and multiple-out (MIMO) anten-
nas. Since it is a shielded environment (like the Wheeler cap), antenna efﬁciency can also
be measured using a reverberation chamber. Some commercial products are already on the
market [20].

7.6.3 Impedance De-embedding Techniques
Sometimes direct measurement of the impedance of an antenna may be a problem. Now let us
have another look at the dual-band PIFA antenna in Example 6.4, as shown in Figure 6.26. The
feed pin is right at the edge of the PCB board. It is not possible to solder a coaxial connector at
this point. For measurement purposes we have to introduce a short microstrip line, as shown
in Figure 6.31 and Figure 7.16. This feed line has been carefully chosen (not to disturb the
antenna current distribution) to minimize its effects on the antenna performance. Although
the introduction of this additional line may not affect the VSWR and return loss if there is
Figure 7.16
A microstrip feed line and a PIFA antenna

276
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
no mismatch and loss, it will certainly change the reading of the impedance. One method of
eliminating the effects of the line and obtaining the impedance at a desired reference point is
the impedance de-embedding technique.
The basic idea of impedance de-embedding is to make an identical feed line with an open-
circuit load and then measure its reﬂection coefﬁcient, which will be used to calculate the
antenna impedance at the desired reference point.
The reﬂection coefﬁcient at the open circuit is +1. If the length of the feed line is l, we can
use Equation (2.38) to obtain the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the connector of the open-circuit line:
S11open = (l)open = e−2γl
(7.23)
Similarly, the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the connector of the antenna can be expressed as
S11ant = (l)ant = 0e−2γl
(7.24)
Thus, the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the antenna (0) is the ratio of the measured S11ant to S11open
0 = S11ant
S11open
(7.25)
This is the principle of impedance de-embedding. This result can also be used to obtain the
return loss, VSWR and input impedance, as discussed in Chapter 2. A formula can be yielded
from Equation (2.28) to calculate the impedance:
Za = Z0
1 + 0
1 −0
(7.26)
As seen in Figure 7.16, an open-circuit stripline is made to match the feed line of the
PIFA antenna. The measured and simulated results are given in Figures 6.32 and 6.33. Good
agreement has been obtained. Without using impedance de-embedding, these results would be
different, especially the impedance.
7.6.4 Probe Array in Near-Field Systems
Lars Jacob Foged
Engineering Director, SATIMO
7.6.4.1 Introduction
Further to the discussion on the near-ﬁeld chamber in Section 7.4.5, we are going to present
a more detailed introduction and examination on the near-ﬁeld measurement techniques with
reference to SATIMO systems in this section.
Spherical near-ﬁeld measurements are traditionally conducted by sampling two orthogonal
ﬁeld components on a sphere surrounding the AUT. At any point on the spherical measurement
surface the measurement antenna (probe) must point to the center of the sphere. In principle,
it does not matter which of the two antennas moves relative to the other: the AUT may be

Antenna Manufacturing and Measurements
277
ﬁxed, with all rotations being done by the probe; the AUT may rotate around two axes with
the probe rotating around its bore-sight axis; or the AUT may rotate around one axis with the
probe rotating around two axes. If the probe is dual-polarized, there is no need to rotate the
probe around its bore-sight axis.
Spherical near-ﬁeld antenna testing exploits the fact that the AUT can be characterized by
a ﬁnite, discrete set of coefﬁcients, which expresses the radiation and, due to reciprocity, the
receiving properties of the antenna. These coefﬁcients are the weight factors in a truncated
expansion of the AUT radiation in spherical vector waves. This expansion satisﬁes Maxwell’s
equations and allows the complete characterization of the AUT radiation everywhere outside
a sphere centered in the reference coordinate system and completely enclosing the AUT. The
calculation of the far-ﬁeld radiation from the spherical wave expansion is often referred to as
near ﬁeld to far ﬁeld transformation, which was discussed in Section 5.2.1 and [22].
7.6.4.2 Traditional Systems
The actual implementation of the mechanical system can be done in a multitude of ways, with
varying degrees of mechanical complexity, ranging from a fairly simple roll-over-azimuth set-
up to complex double-gantry arm systems, as seen in Figure 7.17. Systems employing probes on
telescopic and/or robotic arms have also been implemented. The advantage of such systems is
their ﬂexibility and also the ability to accommodate planar and cylindrical scanning geometries.

7.6.4.3 Multi-Probe Systems
In the traditional approach, described above, the mechanical movement of the probe and/or
AUT is the time-consuming task with respect to the overall antenna measurement time. It is
evident that an elegant way to reduce the number of mechanical movements, often two or three
in traditional systems, to just one is to use several antennas in the form of an array to perform
the ﬁeld sampling in one dimension. This leads to a reduction in mechanical complexity, which
signiﬁcantly reduces the time required to complete a measurement close to a factor equal to the
number of antennas in the array. An implementation of a spherical near-ﬁeld system based on
probe arrays is shown in Figure 7.14. The array elements are mounted on a circular arch and
embedded in multilayer conformal absorbers. The probe tips protrude through small crossed
slots in the smooth curvature of the absorbers, keeping the reﬂectivity of the probe array at
a minimum. The absorbing material also reduces scattering and reﬂections from the support
structure and cabling. The full sphere measurement is performed by electronically scanning
the probe array in elevation and rotating the AUT 180 degrees in azimuth, as illustrated in
Figure 7.18.

probe in the array by perturbing the electromagnetic properties of the probe. The result of this
perturbation is a modulation frequency component in the output signal, which is directly related
to the amplitude and phase of the incident ﬁeld at the location of the probe. By sequentially
modulating each probe in the probe array it is possible to measure virtually in real time the
amplitude and phase at each probe location without the need for an expensive high-frequency
multiplexing network. The array of sensors is connected to the receiving equipment through
a simple passive power-dividing network, as seen in Figure 7.18. This patented measurement
concept is referred to as the Advanced Modulated Scattering Technique (A-MST).
Satimo’s A-MST probes are dual polarized and operate over more than a decade of band-
width. The low-frequency modulator operates in the kHz frequency range, enabling the use of
standard low-cost electronic components. The low-frequency modulator is synchronized with
the receiver data acquisition to provide phase and amplitude measurements at each probe in
fractions of a millisecond.
The major advantage of the A-MST technology over mechanically scanned systems is the
drastic improvement in measurement speed. For tests with up to a few tens of frequencies, the
test time is generally reduced proportionally to the number of elements in the probe array. As

an example, a recently installed vehicle-based antenna test system is able to do multifrequency
spherical near-ﬁeld measurements with 1◦elevation and azimuth resolution in less than ﬁve
minutes. Comparable systems based on single-probe mechanical scanning would require at
least four hours for completing the same test.
7.6.4.4 Probe Array Calibration
Since the array probes have low directivity throughout the operating frequencies and the
measurement distance to the AUT is not too close, the probes may be assumed to behave like
Hertzian dipoles and the received signal will be proportional to the electric ﬁeld parallel to
the polarization of each probe. This means that traditional probe correction is not required in
the near to far ﬁeld transformation. However, since the probes are manufactured using high-
volume industrial production techniques, the probe response cannot be assumed to be equal
in amplitude, phase and polarization orientation. To correct for these discrepancies, a probe
array calibration is performed.
SATIMO’s probe arrays are calibrated by pointing a linearly polarized antenna toward each
of the probes, as shown in Figure 7.20. Dual-polarized, phase and amplitude measurements
are taken as the antenna is rotated in polarization in front of each probe. From these data a
set of calibration coefﬁcients is derived for each probe. The calibrated horizontal and vertical
components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are obtained from the measurements. The process is
able to compensate for differences among probes, align the polarization axes and reduce the
cross-polarization components. After calibration, the typically measured probe uniformity is
better than ±0.1 dB in amplitude and ±1◦in phase.
7.6.4.5 Gain Calibration
The directivity of an AUT is determined by a spherical near-ﬁeld measurement followed by a
near to far ﬁeld transformation. During the transformation, the total radiated power is calculated
and the ﬁeld is normalized to obtain the directivity of the AUT in dBi.
The gain of the AUT is determined by the gain-transfer technique, also known as the gain-
substitution technique, which has been adapted for spherical near-ﬁeld measurement [22, 23,
24]. The gain-substitution technique requires a reference antenna with a known gain. Any

calibrated antenna can be used as reference but very often a standard-gain horn is used for
simplicity. The far ﬁeld of the AUT is calculated from the spherical near-ﬁeld measurement
through the application of a near to far ﬁeld transformation. Another full-sphere measurement
of a reference antenna with a well-known gain is carried out at the same frequency and with
the same set-up as for the AUT and the corresponding far ﬁeld of the reference antenna is
calculated. Comparing the far ﬁelds of the AUT and the reference antenna, the AUT gain can
be calculated.
In spherical near-ﬁeld measurements there are two practical approaches for gain determina-
tion based on the known gain or efﬁciency performance of the reference. The two methods are
often referred to as gain calibration and efﬁciency calibration techniques. Both approaches
can determine the gain of the AUT according to the IEEE deﬁnition [12, 24].
7.6.4.6 Performance Validation
A very efﬁcient way to validate an antenna test range is to measure a known reference antenna
or compare measurements with a known reference facility. Alternatively, measurements on a
reference antenna in which calculated performances can be determined with a high conﬁdence
level can be used. A double-ridged horn has been used to compare the results from different
institutes using different facilities. A very good agreement has been obtained [25, 26].
7.6.4.7 Application
The probe array technology is used extensively in many demanding measurement tasks. There
is no theoretical upper limit for the frequency range, although spherical near-ﬁeld systems
rarely go beyond 60 GHz, since very high-frequency antennas tend to be directive due to their

physical size and thus near-ﬁeld systems based on planar scanning are often preferred due to
the simpler mechanics.
The lower frequency limit for probe array technology is often imposed by the physical size
of the range. Probe arrays have been used down to 70 MHz in automotive testing. Figure 7.21
shows the implementation of an automotive system for the characterization of complete car
systems from 70 MHz to 18 GHz.
7.7 Summary
In this chapter we have addressed two practical issues: antenna manufacturing and measure-
ments. The focus has been placed on the measurements. We have introduced the S-parameters
and equipment and provided a good overview of the possible measurement systems with an
in-depth example at the end. Some measurement techniques and problems have also been
presented.

Special Topics
In this chapter we will address a few ‘hot’ topics and timely issues in antennas, which include
electrically small antennas, mobile antennas, antenna diversity, multiband and ultra-wideband
(UWB) antennas, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) antennas and reconﬁgurable anten-
nas. The aim is to broaden your knowledge and provide you with information on the latest
developments in antennas.
8.1 Electrically Small Antennas
8.1.1 The Basics and Impedance Bandwidth
8.1.1.1 Introduction
Whether it is to reduce wind loading, to allow more attractive products or simply to reduce
costs, antenna engineers are routinely asked to reduce the size of designs without signiﬁcantly
compromising their performance. Hence, it is important to know that there are fundamental
limits that determine the relationship between antenna size, bandwidth and efﬁciency. When the
antenna size becomes too small, either the bandwidth or the efﬁciency must be compromised:
this section gives the fundamental relations between antenna volume, bandwidth and efﬁciency.
The bandwidth of an antenna can be broadened to some degree using passive circuitry.
However, once again, there are limits to the improvements that can be realized and the circuits
introduce losses of their own. Again, this section quantiﬁes the improvements that can be
achieved.
Though somewhat arbitrary, an antenna is often considered to be electrically small when
the following condition is met
r
λ ≤1
2π
(8.1)
where r is the radius of a sphere that just contains the antenna and λ is the wavelength. The
concept of a sphere that just encloses the antenna is illustrated in Figure 8.1. Note that the
feed terminals are not necessarily at the center of the sphere. We will see that this concept is
important to the theory and interpretation of minimal antenna Q.

In the remainder of this section on the basics of small antennas, ﬁrst slope parameters are
introduced and related to the simple series and parallel resonant circuits of Chapter 2 (where the
quality factor, Q, is derived). It is shown that the quality factor can be expressed in terms of the
resistance and the derivative of the reactance with frequency. This applies at any frequency, not
just at resonance, allowing the basic antenna Q to be determined from the antenna impedance
(and variation with frequency), independent of any matching networks.
Secondly, relations between the quality factor and fractional impedance bandwidth are
derived, with particular emphasis given to the criteria for maximum bandwidth.
Thirdly, the fundamental limits of antenna size, the unloaded quality factor and efﬁciency
are reviewed.
Finally, the limits of bandwidth broadening using passive circuits are summarized. This
yields the maximum possible bandwidth available from an antenna of a given size that is
matched with an idealized circuit. This circuit requires an inﬁnite number of components.
Hence, a more practical analysis is given, focusing particularly on single-stage matching cir-
cuits, often referred to as double-tuning circuits [1]. This analysis is extended to include the
case where the bandwidth-broadening components have ﬁnite losses. A simple, but impor-
tant, relation is derived showing the efﬁciency of a double-tuning circuit as a function of the
antenna and circuit quality factors. This relation puts the concentration on double tuning in
context, indicating that higher order bandwidth broadening (via additional circuitry) is often
not worthwhile.

where X and B are the reactance and susceptance respectively. These parameters allow dis-
tributed circuits such as transmission lines to be represented by series or parallel lumped
equivalent circuits.
The slope is normally speciﬁed only at resonance or anti-resonance (for series and parallel
equivalent circuits respectively). However, here we allow the slope to be calculated at any
frequency and show that the use of the slope parameters is quite general.
Using the series resonant circuit of Figure 2.21, the series slope parameter, x, is given by
x = 1

Comparing this with Equation (2.57), the generalized formula for the quality factor, gives
x = QR. Thus, the quality factor can immediately be written in terms of the slope parameter
Q = x
R = ω

(8.5)
It is not necessary to insist that the circuit is resonant, as is often assumed. It is convenient
to apply this description to antenna problems, where the antenna has a series resonant nature
but is not resonant: in particular, small antennas often have such characteristics. Similarly, the
parallel slope parameter can be applied to antennas with substantially parallel resonances. In
the parallel case
Q = b
G = ω
2G
d B
dω
(8.6)
where G is the conductance of the circuit.
So far the Q factor has been deﬁned for series and parallel circuits, both in a fundamental
form and in a slope parameter form that is readily applied to distributed components and some
antennas. It has also been shown in Chapter 2 that the unloaded Q and fractional bandwidth
only obey the commonly used relation BF = 1/Q for series or parallel circuits. In the text
that follows, slope parameters are used for antennas that display predominantly series resonant
impedance characteristics. In such cases, Equation (8.5) is used to relate the slope parameters
to the quality factor. However, it should be understood that the quality factor, when derived in
this way, is approximate, with an accuracy dependent on how well the antenna response can
be modeled as a series resonant circuit (over a narrow bandwidth). For antenna problems, the
loaded quality factor is required in order to ﬁnd the impedance (power transfer) bandwidth.
8.1.1.3 Impedance Bandwidth
The unloaded bandwidths of simple circuits are related to their unloaded quality factors in
Section 2.3.3. The bandwidths are based on power delivered to the load with assumed perfect
sources (i.e. a voltage source is assumed for a series circuit and a current source for a parallel
circuit). In practice, power transfer will depend on the relationship between the source and load
impedances. Hence, it is important to consider the impedance bandwidth of the resonant circuit
and to go on to ﬁnd the bandwidth of power transfer from the source to the load. The most
straightforward way to do this is to consider the bandwidth over which the reﬂection coefﬁcient,

ρ, or transmission coefﬁcient, τ, is less than some predetermined limit. An example might be
to consider the points at which |ρ|2 = |τ|2 = 0.5, since this corresponds to the 3 dB points
of power transmission with a reﬂection coefﬁcient of 0.707. In practical designs a reﬂection
of half the power at the antenna is seldom tolerated and the reﬂection coefﬁcient is normally
speciﬁed to be lower than this: for example, mobile phone antennas are often designed to a
speciﬁcation of ρ = 0.5 (still quite high, reﬂecting the difﬁculty associated with small antenna
design and the variability of the antenna impedance when the phone is used), whereas HF
(high-frequency) broadcast antennas (dipole arrays that operate in a number of bands over a
total bandwidth of approximately an octave) are often designed for ρ = 0.2.
We assume that a series resonant circuit can be used to represent an antenna and, as such,
give the relevant components the subscript A, as shown in Figure 8.2.
Taking Z0κ RA, the antenna transmission coefﬁcient is given by
|τ|2 = 1 −|ρ|2 =

Compared with Equation (2.66), it is clear that the transmission (or loaded) bandwidth is
twice the unloaded bandwidth previously calculated in Section 2.3.3. The 3 dB transmission
bandwidth is equal to the inverse of the loaded Q at resonance. In turn, this is half the unloaded
Q when the resistance of the load is equal to the resistance of the source.
To ﬁnd out what the optimum matching impedance is for maximum bandwidth, we can ﬁnd
the maximum of Equation (8.10) with κ. Differentiating gives

Note that this relation is independent of Q. Since |τ|2 is always less than 1, it can be seen that
Z0 > RA is required to maximize the bandwidth. For example, if we require that |τ|2 is greater
than 0.75 (equivalent to a 6 dB return loss or better), Z0 = 1.67RA.
The relations derived above can also be applied to a parallel circuit by taking RA = κ Z0.
Here it is required that Z0 < RA.

(i.e. the maximum bandwidth), BFopt:

This is the maximum fractional bandwidth available from a series or parallel resonant
antenna with an optimal resistance at resonance (for a given reﬂection coefﬁcient). The system
bandwidth and target reﬂection coefﬁcient are usually known, from which the required antenna
Q can be calculated. Alternatively, the system bandwidth and antenna Q may be known and it

over the band.

This gives the antenna resistance required to minimize the reﬂection coefﬁcient over the re-
quired bandwidth.
Whether we optimize for bandwidth or reﬂection coefﬁcient, it is necessary to know how
large the antenna has to be in order to achieve a certain Q.
8.1.1.4 Fundamental Limits of Antenna Size, Q and Efﬁciency
It has long been recognized that, for a given frequency, the size of an antenna cannot be
indeﬁnitely reduced without compromising the Q, the efﬁciency or both. This problem was
ﬁrst explored in the 1940s. In 1947, Wheeler [3] derived a relation between antenna volume
and the maximum achievable ‘power factor’ (equal to the inverse of the quality factor). In
1948, Chu [4] extended Wheeler’s analysis by expressing radiated ﬁelds in terms of spherical
modes. Chu’s method is general and can be applied to any antenna; however, to allow this,
Chu speciﬁed that the antenna should be contained within a sphere (as indicated in Figure
8.1) in which no energy can be stored. This is an idealized, rather optimistic, assumption that
makes the underlying mathematics tractable and has often been used in subsequent work. Most
antennas will store some energy within this sphere, increasing the Q. Chu used a partial fraction
expansion of the wave impedance of spherical modes that exist outside the sphere bounding
the antenna to obtain an equivalent (approximate) ladder network from which the Q can be
calculated using circuit analysis.
A second phase of work on the limits of small antennas occurred in the 1960s. In 1960,
Harrington [5] related antenna size, minimum Q and gain (including losses) for linearly and
circularly polarized waves. In 1964, Collin and Rothschild [6] presented an exact method for
ﬁnding the minimum Q without using the approximate equivalent network of Chu, for both
spherical and cylindrical modes. In 1969, Fante [7] extended these results to include antennas
with mixed polarization.
Nearly thirty years then passed before a third phase of work was undertaken in the mid-1990s.
McLean [8, 9] presented a simple but exact method of determining the minimum antenna Q,

Special Topics
289
based on the observation that the lowest order TM01 and TE01 spherical modes have ﬁelds that
correspond to inﬁnitesimal electric and magnetic current elements respectively. Both linear
and circular polarization can be treated this way. In 1999, Foltz and McLean [10] showed that
antennas constrained to shapes other than spheres and cylinders could also be treated. More
recently, Thiele et al. [11] addressed the question of why the previous theory has been found
to be too optimistic in practice.
From all of the efforts of the workers listed above, as well as others, we know that the
minimum unloaded Q at resonance of a linearly polarized antenna (when a single lowest order
TM mode is implied) is given by
Q0 = ηA

1
(βr)3 + 1
βr

(8.19)
where r is the minimum radius of a sphere that just encloses the antenna, β is the wave number
(2π/λ) and ηA is the antenna efﬁciency. It should be noted here that the antenna may be brought
to resonance using an external component. Should this be the case, the Q in Equation (8.19)
is that of the antenna and component combined. From Equation (8.1), for small antennas βr
is less than unity and the 1/βr term is small compared to 1/(βr)3; hence, Equation (8.19) can
be approximated by
Q0 ≈ηA

1
(βr)3

(8.20)
Since the volume of the sphere containing the antenna is proportional to the cube of its radius,
the unloaded quality factor is proportional to efﬁciency and inversely proportional to volume.
The fundamental limits of antenna size, Q factor and efﬁciency are shown graphically in
Figure 8.3. For all points on and above the solid black line, the antenna can be 100% efﬁcient.
However, for all points below this line it can be seen that small antennas exhibit a trade-off
between size, Q factor (bandwidth) and efﬁciency. Clearly there is little advantage in trading
loss for bandwidth. The only other mechanism that allows these curves to be exceeded is that of
interaction, either between the antenna and its supporting structure or via parasitic coupling. In
the case of mobile communications equipment, both the antenna and the handset (particularly
the PCB) that carries the radio are fed by the source. Radiation from the PCB increases the
effective volume of the antenna and, hence, the bandwidth.
8.1.1.5 The Limits of Bandwidth Broadening
Narrowband antennas often exhibit impedance characteristics that can be modeled by series or
parallel resonant circuits. It is easy to show that the bandwidth of a series resonant circuit can
be enlarged using a shunt-connected parallel circuit of the same resonant frequency. Similarly,
the bandwidth of a parallel resonant circuit can be enlarged by the series connection of a series
resonant circuit. This is often referred to as double tuning [1]. For example, consider the series
resonant antenna shown in Figure 8.4, with a corresponding parallel resonant double-tuning
circuit formed by L M and CM.
It is interesting to look at the energy storage and, therefore, the Q factor of this conﬁguration.
The energy stored and dissipated in the series components is given by Equation (2.56) whereas

Q = Q A + QME
(8.22)
Here Q A is the Q of the series arm, while QME is the equivalent Q of the parallel circuit, with a
conductance equal to 1/RA. Hence, the series and parallel contributions to Q can be considered
to be additive and the total Q is increased. However, if the parallel and series arms of the circuit
are resonant at the same frequency, the impedance bandwidth of the circuit is increased (this
will be seen later in this section). Thus, we have a seemingly contradictory situation where
both the impedance bandwidth and the Q increase simultaneously. This illustrates a basic
problem – there is no strict relationship between antenna Q and bandwidth. The formulas
derived previously can only be applied (with care) when the antenna impedance can be closely
modeled as either a series or parallel resonant circuit. Fortunately, this limitation can often be
satisﬁed, particularly for narrow bandwidths.
Bandwidth-broadening concepts of simple, for example resonant, circuits were generalized
by Bode [12] and in two well-known papers by Fano [13, 14]. Fano’s theory states that the
maximum achievable fractional bandwidth, BF∞of a series or parallel resonant circuit in
combination with an optimal bandwidth-broadening network, comprised of an inﬁnite number
of elements, is given by

where |ρ| is a chosen maximum reﬂection coefﬁcient. The improvement in bandwidth offered
by the inﬁnite-order bandwidth-broadening network, F∞, is given by the ratio of Equations

Interpreting the theory presented is not straightforward, since these relations only strictly
apply to antennas that can be represented by series or parallel equivalent circuits. Often,
antenna designs that are reported as low Q are designs that incorporate lumped or distributed
bandwidth-broadening circuitry on the antenna itself. The widely cited Goubau antenna [15]
is believed to be an example of this. When this is the case, some of the available bandwidth
broadening has already been realized on the antenna, such that only reduced improvement is
possible from an external circuit.
Assuming that the antenna is well represented by a series or parallel LCR circuit, the formula
given previously for the limits of (linearly polarized) antennas and bandwidth broadening can

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
This relation gives the maximum possible bandwidth available from an antenna of a given
size that is matched with an idealized circuit containing an inﬁnite number of components.
However, it is rather optimistic, predominantly for two reasons:
r It is assumed that the antenna stores no energy within the enclosing radius, r. In practice,
this is never achieved.
r Practical bandwidth-broadening circuits have ﬁnite losses – this is addressed in more detail
in the text that follows.
Quite clearly, a network of inﬁnite order is impractical. Hence, it is useful to consider how
much improvement can be gained from a network with just a limited number of stages. In
the following sections one stage is considered in detail – i.e. a double-tuning network. The
analysis is complete, i.e. losses are included. The results of this analysis are then extrapolated
qualitatively to circuits of higher order.
Consider a series resonant antenna that is double-tuned by a parallel resonant LC circuit (as
shown in Figure 8.4). This operation is shown graphically in Figure 8.5.
The admittance of the antenna, YA, is given by

Optimum double tuning occurs when the susceptance of the antenna is tuned to zero at the band
edges. In Figure 8.5 this is termed the cross-over point. It is not worth double tuning beyond this
point. Doing so would only increase the band-edge mismatch, since the constant conductance
circle that passes through the band edges lies outside the constant reﬂection coefﬁcient circle
that passes through the point at which the antenna is resonant, as illustrated in Figure 8.6. When
the antenna is optimally double-tuned it is observed that the maximum reﬂection coefﬁcient is
always along the resistive axis.
The resistance associated with the double tuning cross-over point, RC , is given by
RC = R2

For fractional bandwidths of less than 20% this approximate relation is accurate to within

gives
Z0 = RA

1 + (Q A0BF)2
(8.30)
This relation allows the antenna resistance to be optimized (for a particular characteristic
impedance) prior to double tuning. By comparing Equations (8.30) and (8.18) it can be seen
that the antenna resistances required for an optimized reﬂection coefﬁcient with and without
double tuning are the same.
Having found the required resistance, it is then necessary to ﬁnd the double-tuning compo-
nents required. From Equations (8.26) and (8.28), the antenna band-edge susceptance, BAE,
is given by

where L M is the double-tuning inductance.
For optimum double tuning, BAE and BME should be equal and opposite. Equating Equations

The relations above allow the double-tuning components to be chosen based only on the
characteristic impedance of the system and the antenna resonant frequency and equivalent
inductance.
Having derived the necessary relations, the bandwidth improvement available from a single
double-tuning network can be found (for a given reﬂection coefﬁcient) and related to the
maximum possible improvement given by Fano’s theory.

We have already seen that, for a particular system or characteristic impedance, the antenna
resistance at resonance required for double tuning is identical to that required for an optimum
match without any additional circuitry. Referring to Figure 8.5, the optimum reﬂection coef-
ﬁcient prior to double tuning is worst at the band edges. Using Equation (8.28), this is given
by

(8.38)
Hence, for a deﬁned bandwidth, there is a very simple relation between the reﬂection coefﬁ-
cient after double tuning, |ρDT|, and the optimum reﬂection coefﬁcient prior to double tuning,
|ρOPT|.
Alternatively, by rearranging Equation (8.38), the bandwidth with double tuning, BFDT , can
be written
BFDT =

2√|ρ|
1 −|ρ|
(8.39)
where |ρ| is a chosen, or target, reﬂection coefﬁcient magnitude. Comparing this with the
optimum bandwidth available without any circuitry, given in Equation (8.15), yields the double-
tuning bandwidth improvement factor, FDT , as follows
FDT = 1 + |ρ|
√|ρ|
(8.40)
The variation of FDT and the maximum possible improvement, F∞, given previously in
Equation (8.24), are shown in Figure 8.7.

It can be seen that the improvement factors are largest for small reﬂection coefﬁcients.
Importantly, approximately half of the total improvement is achieved with a double-tuning
network.
The analysis so far has assumed all components to be lossless. Of course, this is not the
situation encountered in practice, and the effects of component losses must be considered.
Here only the losses associated with double tuning will be considered. Referring to Figure 8.4,

We assume that the antenna resistance is optimized as deﬁned by Equation (8.30) and that
this optimum condition is unaffected by the ﬁnite Q of the double-tuning circuit (a reasonable
assumption if the conductivity of the double-tuning circuit is considerably less than that of the
antenna). Using Equation (8.33) gives

This is a very simple relation dependent only on the antenna and double-tuning circuit Q
factors. There is no bandwidth dependency. Note also that Equation (8.46) does not include
the effects of mismatch.
It is clear that, for good efﬁciency, the double-tuning circuit Q should be much higher
than that of the antenna. For example, dual-band mobile phones have typical antenna Qs of
approximately 15, while a lumped circuit double-tuning network will have a typical Q of,
at best, 50. Using these values gives a band-edge efﬁciency of 77%. GSM and DCS have
fractional bandwidths of approximately 10%. With double tuning, using Equation (8.38), the
band-edge mismatch efﬁciency is 92%. This gives a combined band-edge efﬁciency of 71%.
From Equation (8.17), the mismatch efﬁciency without double tuning is 71%. Hence, in this
example,thereisnoadvantageinusingdoubletuning–theimprovementinmismatchefﬁciency
(return loss) is counter-balanced by the mismatch corrected efﬁciency (insertion loss) of the
double-tuning circuit. Of course, there may be other reasons for using double tuning. For
example, the improved antenna return loss will reduce cumulative losses in subsequent parts
of the RF chain. Also, the double-tuning circuit provides a degree of ﬁltering. However, it is
clear that the use of bandwidth-broadening techniques requires the use of high Q resonant
circuits (with respect to the antenna Q).
Circuits with higher orders of bandwidth broadening require resonators with increased slope
parameters, increasing the losses of each stage. Also, the losses of each stage of the network
will be cumulative. Hence, high-order bandwidth-broadening circuits will require very high
Q resonators. Since approximately half of the maximum bandwidth improvement is provided
by a single resonator with only moderate loss, higher order circuits are often not worthwhile.
It should also be recognized that personal devices such as mobile phones are used in a man-
ner such that the driving-point impedance of the antenna is variable within limits deﬁned by the
modes of use. For example, the antenna of a mobile phone will present different impedances
when in free space and when held in ‘talk position’. High-order bandwidth-broadening cir-
cuits are critical and, hence, may become counterproductive when large impedance varia-
tions are experienced. Simple double-tuning circuits are thought to be more robust in this
respect.
8.1.1.6 Discussions and Conclusions
Some basic and important relations that are used to determine antenna bandwidth have just
been introduced. In particular, it has been shown that when antennas can be represented as

298
Antennas: From Theory to Practice
series or parallel resonant circuits, as is often the case for small antennas, the quality factor can
be found from the resistance and the derivative of the reactance with frequency. This applies
at any frequency, not just at resonance, and allows comparison between different designs in a
fundamental way.
Wehaveshownthatantennasrepresentedbyseriesorparallelresonantcircuitshaveoptimum
bandwidth when mismatched at resonance. Series resonant circuits are required to have a
resistanceatresonancethatislowerthanthesystem(orcharacteristic)impedance.Theconverse
applies to parallel resonant circuits. For maximum bandwidth, the level of mismatch depends
only on the reﬂection coefﬁcient magnitude at which the bandwidth is measured. However, for
a minimum reﬂection coefﬁcient over a given bandwidth, the level of mismatch is inversely
related to the antenna quality factor.
The limits of antenna size, bandwidth and efﬁciency have been reviewed, likewise the limits
of passive bandwidth broadening. We have seen that there is no universal relationship between
bandwidth and quality factor and that some care must be applied when interpreting how well a
particular antenna performs. Some small antennas have distributed reactive networks integrated
within the antenna structure. Such networks can provide a degree of bandwidth broadening.
When this is the case, further bandwidth-broadening circuitry will give improvements lower
than those stated both in this chapter and in the literature – some of the available improvement
will have been ‘used’ on the antenna.
A combined formula has been given, showing the maximum possible bandwidth available
from an antenna of a given size that is matched with an idealized circuit containing an inﬁnite
number of components.
A more practical analysis of the bandwidth broadening available from a double-tuning
circuit with ﬁnite losses has been undertaken. A simple new formula for the efﬁciency of
a double-tuning network was derived. This relation indicates the degree to which the Q of
any double-tuning circuit must be higher than the Q of the antenna (or any other load) that
requires broadbanding. From this result, it is reasoned that high-order bandwidth broadening
is only possible if extremely good circuit technologies are used. High-order circuitry is also
thought to be too critical for applications such as mobile phones, such that it could become
counterproductive if the antenna impedance were to vary due to user interaction. Double tuning
is thought to be less susceptible to changes in the antenna impedance that occur due to user
interaction and places less stringent requirements on component quality. Double tuning can
approximately double the bandwidth of an antenna designed for a reﬂection coefﬁcient of
0.5 (such as a typical mobile phone antenna). This is approximately half the improvement
available from a network of inﬁnite order. Hence, often only double tuning is required – higher
order bandwidth-broadening circuits are unlikely to bring signiﬁcant additional improvements
overall.
To maximize the beneﬁts of bandwidth broadening, high-quality circuit technologies
are required. For some applications such components are available. For example, air
wound inductors and vacuum capacitors – with Q factors of around 200 and 1000 re-
spectively – are used for AM broadcast applications. For other applications, such as mo-
bile phones, size and technology constraints are such that inductor and capacitor Qs
are typically 30 and 100 respectively. Inductors are avoided where possible. In such
cases it is often more desirable to form distributed double-tuning circuits on the antenna
itself.

8.1.2 Antenna Size-Reduction Techniques
There are many ways of reducing the size of an antenna. Some of the most common are:
r top loading;
r matching;
r reactive loading;
r dielectric loading.
Each of these methods will be dealt with in the sections that follow.
8.1.2.1 Top Loading
Consider the monopole above ground shown in Figure 8.8. The current distribution indicated
can be maintained by keeping the length of the antenna approximately constant, but having
some of the structure located parallel to the ground, as shown for the ‘T’, ‘Star’ and ‘Disc’
conﬁgurations. This allows the height of the antenna to be reduced without changing the
resonant frequency.
However, as indicated for the ‘T’ antenna in Figure 8.9, currents on the upper part of the
structure cancel out currents induced in the ground. Hence, while the current distribution
is maintained, the part of the antenna that is parallel to the ground contributes very little to
radiation. Radiation thus emanates from a smaller part of the ‘T’ antenna than for the monopole
and the radiation resistance reduces.
However, the radiation resistance is still higher than it would be for a monopole of the same
height, h, as the ‘T’ antenna, due to the more rectangular shape of the current distribution of
the vertical part of the latter. This can be explained by considering the linear antenna shown
in Figure 8.10. The current on the antenna is broken up into small elements, from which it is
possible to calculate the radiation resistance for different current distributions.

Again, taking (Nδl)/λ = 0.1, the radiation resistance is approximately equal to 8 . Inspection
of Equations (8.48) and (8.49) also shows that a factor of four improvement is possible. Hence,
top loading not only allows the resonant frequency to be maintained as the antenna height is
reduced, it also improves the radiation resistance for a given height. Hence, it is a very popular
and widespread method of achieving a low-proﬁle structure. An early example of the use of
top loading is shown in Figure 8.11.
The Titanic famously sank in 1912. Marconi-installed transmitter equipment was used to
sound the alarm using the (normally not shown) large ‘T’ antenna.
8.1.2.2 Matching
Most electrically small antennas have a low radiation resistance and high, normally capaci-
tive, reactance. A simple approach, illustrated in Figure 8.12, is to match this impedance to
50  – or whatever the system impedance might be – using discrete components, for example
two inductors, or an inductor and a capacitor.

Radiation from meandered structures
Some attention must be paid to the component quality when using this technique; for ex-
ample, for MF (medium frequency) broadcasting, air core inductors and vacuum capacitors
are used in order to minimize losses. Litz wire – designed to have lower losses due to the skin
effect than conventional solid conductors – may also be used. Many strands are used with a
conductive coating on each strand. Current is spread across the strand, which increases the
effective outer area of the conductor for a given circumference. The strands are also twisted in
a way that minimizes the induction of opposing electromagnetic ﬁelds in other strands.
8.1.2.3 Reactive Loading
A common method of reducing the resonant frequency of a small antenna is to use some
form of reactive loading. The aim is to store enough magnetic energy (to create inductance) to
counter the electric energy (capacitance) that is associated with most small antennas. This is
illustrated for two meandered structures in Figure 8.13.
The bold arrows show, broadly speaking, where radiation occurs. The nonbold arrows can
be considered to be in pairs that have opposite directions. Hence, they cancel in the far ﬁeld
and do not produce any radiation. However, they do store energy in the near ﬁeld, and this can
be used to reduce the antenna resonant frequency.
An alternative way of viewing this is that the antenna length is maintained at approximately
λ/4, so that the resonant frequency is the same as that of an equivalent λ/4 monopole. However,
since radiation comes from less of the structure, the radiation resistance must be reduced. In
practice, the length of the meander must be somewhat longer than λ/4 in order to achieve
resonance.
Another example of reactive loading – this time applied to planar antennas – is shown in
Figure 8.14. Slots and notches are cut in the antenna structure in order to lengthen the path
over which current travels (energy is also stored around the slots and notches), reducing the
resonant frequency.

right shows the top of the antenna)
8.1.2.4 Dielectric Loading
A high dielectric constant material can be used to achieve a slow wave structure that allows
smaller resonators to be realized. Antennas with dielectric loading have the advantage that
tuning capacitance can easily be built in to the structure. For consumer wireless applications,
it is also possible to excite a polarization out of the plane of a host PCB. However, dielectric
antennas are not immune to the fundamental limits of bandwidth, size and efﬁciency: smaller
means narrower bandwidth. Also, loss occurs within the dielectric material and the high Q
nature of such antennas tends to increase the losses in conductors. Often these conductors have
a conductivity that is compromised somewhat in order to be compatible with the dielectric
material from a manufacturing standpoint.
Figure 8.15 shows a meandered, dielectric loaded monopole antenna manufactured for dual-
band mobile phones. The antennas measure 17 × 10 × 2 mm and the dielectric constant is
approximately 20.
Figure 8.16 shows a half-wave global positioning system (GPS) patch antenna. Since the
wavelength is determined by the dielectric constant, εr, of the patch substrate, the antenna

Measured efﬁciency of GPS patch antennas of the dimensions indicated

so the antenna size can be reduced signiﬁcantly without necessarily reducing efﬁciency. How-
ever, the measured results shown in Figure 8.17 indicate that as the antenna size is reduced,
there is an almost inevitable reduction in antenna efﬁciency (the bandwidth also reduces, as
expected).
8.2 Mobile Antennas, Antenna Diversity and Human Body Effects
8.2.1 Introduction
The term mobile radio is rather loosely used to describe a radio communication link where at
least one end of the link is either at an unknown location or in motion. Marconi’s transmission
from a ﬁxed site on the Isle of Wight, England to a tug-boat located at an ill-deﬁned position
approximately 18 miles away was probably the ﬁrst example of such a link in 1888. To be
more speciﬁc, this was an example of maritime mobile radio. An early example of a land-based
mobile transceiver is given in Figure 8.18.
Here, Marconi and Fleming are pictured with a Thornycroft steam bus outside the Haven
Hotel in Poole, England just before the turn of the 20th century. Marconi used amplitude
modulation (AM) at ‘low frequencies’, so the antenna seen attached to the roof of the bus was
probably electrically small, as deﬁned by Equation (8.1).
Since Marconi’s ﬁrst experiments, many other applications have been found which fall into
the broad class of mobile radio. The ﬁrst system to closely resemble the mobile radio networks

that we use today was implemented by the Detroit Police Department in 1921 [16]. It used
a frequency band centered at approximately 2 MHz for communication between a central
controller and police cars. This was an example of a dispatch system, but other modes of
communication – such as walkie-talkies, paging and mobile telephony – soon followed.
This section gives details of the design principles of modern mobile phone antennas. It also
gives a summary of antenna diversity techniques – where two or more receive antennas are
used rather than one – and the effect of the human body on antenna performance.

Initially mobile phones were designed for only one band. However, dual-band phones – for
example, capable of operation in the GSM900 and DCS1800 bands – became the minimum
requirement in Europe in the late 1990s. Tri-band operation in the GSM900, DCS1800 and
PCS1900 bands became commonplace for ‘high-end’ phones in the early 2000s, allowing
operation in many countries. It can be seen from Figure 8.19 that tri-band GSM/DCS/PCS
antenna operation can be achieved using a fundamentally dual-band design with an extended
bandwidth in the higher band. Similarly, four or ﬁve bands may also be covered by extending
the bandwidths of a dual-band design even further.
In the cellular frequency bands, mobile phones transmit at relatively high power levels. GSM,
DCS and UMTS have maximum average output powers of 0.25 W, 0.125 W and 0.125 W (in
Class 4 operation) respectively.
8.2.2.2 The ‘Connectivity’ Frequency Bands
The wireless local area network (WLAN) and personal area network (PAN) bands that are
most commonly used by consumers (i.e. the general public) are indicated in Figure 8.20. The
Global Positioning System (GPS) band is also shown, due to its importance to location-based
services. Other acronyms used are as follows:
UNII
Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure
HIPERLAN
High Performance Radio Local Area Network
In many applications these systems are only used at low power levels (for example, Bluetooth
has a typical output power of 1 mW). Hence, these low-power ‘connectivity’ systems have
very different design requirements/restrictions to cellular systems (which transmit at relatively
high power), both for the antenna and for the RF circuitry.

Main ‘connectivity’ bands (MHz)
The type of antenna that is used with a particular type of phone is normally determined by
aesthetic considerations and speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR) regulations. This will be covered
in more detail later in this chapter. It is a measure of the maximum amount of energy dissipated
per unit volume in any part of the phone user’s body. When the phone is held in ‘talk position’
(i.e. next to the head), this maximum often occurs close to the antenna.
There are four main types of cellular antenna:
r monopoles (whips);
r normal mode helices;
r meander line antennas (loaded/unloaded);
r planar inverted F antennas.
Monopoles and helical antennas are normally located outside the phone casing, as illustrated
in Figure 8.21. There are two broad classes of internal antenna, dependent on the relative
positions of the antenna and printed circuit board (PCB):
r adjacent antenna and PCB – where the antenna is installed next to the PCB (in the manner
of a monopole);
r coincident antenna and PCB – where the antenna is installed on top of the PCB.
These classes are shown diagrammatically in Figure 8.22.

8.2.2.3 Typical Antenna Types
Monopoles
Monopoles were the antenna of choice for the earliest mobile phones and they are still used,
particularly in countries where coverage is limited. They have the advantage of providing
signiﬁcant clearance between the antenna and the head, which allows low SAR and, perhaps
most importantly, high efﬁciency to be achieved. A simple monopole located over a ground
plane is illustrated in Figure 8.23.

Quarter-wave monopole over a ground plane
Most monopoles are operated at an electrical length that is close to a quarter of a wavelength,
when the input resistance is 36  and the input reactance is zero. This impedance matches
quite well with the commonly used system impedance of 50 . When mounted on a typical
handset, monopole antennas can be well matched to 50  when slightly shorter than λ/4, due
to the inﬂuence of the conductive parts of the handset, which also radiate considerably.
Helical Antennas
Helical antennas were widely used in the 1990s, as they occupied considerably less space than
the monopoles that preceded them. They were an early example of a compromise between
technical performance and commercial attractiveness. The performance of helical antennas
is worse than that of their monopole predecessors; however, they allowed smaller, more aes-
thetically attractive phones to be manufactured. This compromise continued with the later
introduction of internal antennas.
A typical helix antenna assembly is shown in Figure 8.24.
The performance is deﬁned by the following parameters (refer to Figure 8.25):
C
circumference
S
spacing between turns
L
unfolded turn length
θ
pitch angle: tan(θ) = S/C
When C/λ is between 0.75 and 1.25, the antenna operates in an axial mode, when the
radiation is along the axis of the antenna (the upward direction shown in Figure 8.24). The
antenna has some useful properties in this mode: the gain is high, the polarization is circular
and the impedance is close to 150 ohms over close to an octave bandwidth. Because of this,
axial mode helices are widely used, for example as satellite antennas. However, they are not
normally used for mobile applications.
When C/λ is less than 0.5, the helix is said to operate in a normal mode, when the radiation
is similar to that of a monopole aligned along the axis of the helix (radiation is predominantly
perpendicular to the axis and the polarization is linear, in line with the axis). In this mode the
antenna is resonant with a height that is signiﬁcantly less than that of a comparable monopole
antenna.

Monopole-Like Antennas
Monopole-like antennas operate in a similar fashion to helical antennas, since they are generally
both reactively loaded in order to reduce size (as discussed in Section 8.1.2). The distinction
made here is that helical antennas are generally external to the phone casing whereas monopole-
like antennas are located internally. As such, the latter are often planar or conform to the shape
of the phone.
Planar Inverted F Antennas
The planar inverted F antenna (PIFA), which was used as a major example in previous chapters,
became the antenna of choice for mobile phones in the late 1990s due to the requirement to
have an internal antenna with a low SAR. They can be seen as evolving from either a monopole
or a half-wave patch antenna. Evolution from a monopole is illustrated in Figure 8.26.

was referred to as a shunt-driven inverted L antenna, though it later became almost universally
known as an inverted F antenna (IFA) [18]. The introduction of the shorting pin allows the low
impedance of the ILA to be transformed up to a more convenient value. To improve bandwidth
(at the expense of antenna size), the wire running parallel to the ground may be replaced by
a planar element, giving a PIFA. As shown in Figure 8.26, the sum of two adjacent sides
of the PIFA should be approximately quarter of a wavelength long at the desired resonant
frequency [19].
Evolution from a half-wave patch antenna is illustrated in Figure 8.27.
Here a probe-fed half-wave patch antenna is ﬁrst short-circuited along a line where the
electric ﬁeld is zero (for the lowest frequency TM001 mode). This halves the size of the antenna
without changing the resonant mode (though there is a loss of directivity, since radiation now
occurs only from one end of the structure rather than two). Such a structure is often referred
to as a full short-circuit PIFA (FS-PIFA), since the short circuit runs the full length of one face
of the antenna (as indicated by the bold line in Figure 8.27). Replacing this short circuit with
a simple shorting pin or tab reduces the resonant frequency further (by increasing the antenna
inductance) and yields a PIFA.

8.2.2.4 The Effect of the PCB
Many small antennas appear to exceed the fundamental limits of antenna size, bandwidth and
efﬁciency outlined in Section 8.1.1. This is because they do not operate alone: there is a strong
interaction with the equipment/PCB that tends to widen the bandwidth.
8.2.2.5 Speciﬁc Absorption Rate (SAR)
The SAR is an important parameter in the design of mobile phones because national and
international regulations must be met and because consumers may buy a particular model of
phone based on the quoted SAR.
SAR is regulated based on the known biological effects of thermal heating. The tempera-
ture increase of the body cannot be directly correlated with the incident radiation due to the
complex thermoregulatory process within the body. Instead, the concept of power absorption
per differential unit mass is used as follows:
SAR = dP
dm =
dP
ρD dV
(8.50)
where,
dP
power absorbed within a differential volume
dm
mass within the volume
dV
differential volume
ρD
density
This can be expressed in terms of the electric ﬁeld as follows:
SAR = σ |E|2
ρD
(8.51)
where
σ
conductivity of the body (which will vary within different biological tissues)
E
the RMS electric ﬁeld strength within the body
The SAR is a power relation speciﬁed at a particular point in space. To convert this to
a temperature rise (and, hence, to a biological effect), it is necessary to average over both
time and mass – or, equivalently, volume. Typical averaging masses of 10 g and 1 g are used
in national and international regulations (unfortunately there is no uniﬁed world regulation).
Averaging over 1 g gives signiﬁcantly higher peak SAR values than averaging over a larger
mass, since signiﬁcant SAR variations occur on a small scale. Hence, the lower mass gives the
most difﬁcult speciﬁcation and is used for most designs.
Figure 8.28 shows a PIFA and a generic monopole-like antenna, both mounted on a 100 ×
40 × 1 mm PCB. These represent the two basic classes of internal antenna as described earlier
in this section. The PIFA is a typical dual-band structure, while the monopole-like antenna is
triangular – a structure that will have relatively low current density and, therefore, relatively
low local ﬁeld strength.
The antenna conﬁgurations are simulated next to a truncated ﬂat representation of the phone
user’s head [20], as shown in Figure 8.29. Such a representation is often referred to as a

phantom surface. The material properties of the head and skin are taken from published
databases.
To minimize reﬂections at the truncation surfaces of the phantom, these surfaces are de-
ﬁned as impedance boundaries, having the intrinsic impedances of the dielectrics used. Using
Equation (3.19), the impedances are as given in Table 8.2
The simulated SAR of the PIFA antenna is shown in Figure 8.30, whereas the SAR of the
monopole-like antenna is given in Figure 8.31. The SAR of the PIFA is clearly lower than that
of the monopole-like antenna due to the shielding of the PCB and the increased distance of the
antenna from the user. This is particularly the case at high frequencies when local ﬁelds at the
antenna dominate.
This example shows that antenna conductors in the plane of the PCB give rise to high local
SARs unless they can be moved further from the head. This effectively restricts the use of such

antennas to the bottom position of the phone. Only when the phone is long enough that there
is sufﬁcient clearance between the antenna and the head can monopole-like antennas be used
with acceptable SAR. This is often the case for ‘ﬂip’ phones.
8.2.2.6 Multipath and Mean Effective Gain
Multipath is the term used to describe the fact that radio signals often occur at a receiver
via several different paths. This is illustrated for a typical mobile radio reception scenario in
Figure 8.32. The scenario shown corresponds with that of a macro-cell, where an elevated

The addition of multipath vectors
base station is free of local scattering (reﬂections and re-radiation from nearby objects). The
mobile, however, is below the height of local clutter and hence receives multipath contri-
butions from many different angles. This is often referred to as a ring of scatters model,
where typical radii of the scatterers from the mobile are of the order of a few hundred
meters.
A summation of the multipath components occurs in the radio receiver, as shown in Figure
8.33. As the mobile moves, each multipath component vector rotates by a different amount,
ui, as indicated. Hence, constructive and destructive interference occurs – a phenomenon that
is known as signal fading. This reﬂects the fact that the signal quality is very poor when the
vector addition of the multipath components produces a fade (a low value due to destructive
interference).
Fades tend to occur at intervals of approximately half a wavelength. Many readers will have
experienced this. For example, FM radio has a wavelength of approximately three meters and
is subject to fading. If a poor signal is experienced whilst listening in a car, reception can be
improved by moving the car forward by a couple of meters.
The performance of an antenna in a multipath environment cannot be quantiﬁed simply
in terms of its free space gain (radiation pattern) since the gain is only speciﬁed in one di-
rection. Thus, we need a more accurate, environment-dependent term, the mean effective
gain (MEG), given by
MEG =

and the user). The angular density functions and the cross-polar ratio deﬁne the propagation
environment.
In any one direction, the gain of the antenna is weighted by the probability of receiving a
multipath component from that direction. This weighting is performed for both polarizations.
A further weighting is also applied based on the relative powers incident in both polarizations.
For high MEG, the antenna radiation pattern should be well matched to the angular proba-
bility distribution and cross-polar ratio of the incoming multipath. The azimuth (φ) distribution
is assumed to be uniform, since multipath originates from all angles around the mobile. The
elevation (θ, as measured from the ground upwards) distributions of some typical environments
are given in Table 8.3. The distributions in elevation are considered here to follow a Gaussian

Distributions other than Gaussian have also been proposed, though the exact form of the dis-
tribution is not normally very important to the ﬁnal MEG. Polarization matching, for example,
is much more important.
The shape of a typical θ-polarized urban macro-cell probability distribution is shown in
Figure 8.34.
The antenna MEG is maximized when the antenna gain maximum coincides with the most
likely direction of multipath reception.

8.2.3 Antenna Diversity
Antenna diversity is a method in which more than one antenna is used to overcome the detri-
mental effects of multipath fading. Figure 8.35 shows the reception from two antennas sub-
jected to the same multipath components. The signal fading from the two antennas occurs
at different times/distances (time and distance can be considered to be interchangeable when
the mobile moves at a constant velocity), since the antennas process or ﬁlter the multipath
in different ways. By combining these two signals, the probability of a deep fade is much
reduced.

The fades shown in Figure 8.35 are typical of those experienced in narrowband cellular radio
systems such as GSM and also those of noncellular systems such as FM radio. Occasionally,
fades can cause the signal strength to drop by as much as 30 dB (both Antenna 1 and Antenna
2 have average signal levels of 0 dB in Figure 8.35). It can be seen that the depth of such fades
and the probability that they will occur are reduced when the signals are combined.
To realize antenna diversity there are two requirements:
r signals must be decorrelated (to some degree) – i.e. two or more signals must be available
that fade at different times/positions;
r a method of combining the signals must be found.
These two requirements are addressed in the sections that follow.
8.2.3.1 Decorrelation Methods
There are several ways of achieving decorrelated signals, i.e. signals that experience fades at
different times or when the mobile is in a different position. These are often referred to as the
types of antenna diversity described below.
1. Polarization diversity:antennapatternsareorthogonallypolarizedandhencepreferentially
receive only one of the two incoming polarization states. All multipath components will,
to some degree, have both polarization states, the amplitudes and phases of which will be
different. Hence, orthogonally polarized antennas will perform different vector summations
of the multipath components and they will be decorrelated.
2. Spatial diversity: here multipath components will have different phases at the receive
antennas due to their spacing. Unlike polarization diversity, the amplitudes of the multipath
components will be the same at both antennas.
3. Radiation pattern diversity: here the magnitudes and phases of the antenna radiation
patterns are arranged such that they do not overlap. Hence, the antenna directivity causes
different multipath components to be added.
All three of the above mechanisms – polarization, spatial and radiation pattern – are usually
present when antennas are closely spaced, such that decorrelated reception can be achieved
at smaller spacings than often thought possible. Spacing is often limited by antenna isolation
rather than antenna correlation.
The envelope correlation coefﬁcient is given by

where Eiθ and Eiφ indicate the complex radiation pattern of the ith antenna in the θ and
φ polarizations respectively. It is important to note here that all radiation patterns have a

magnitude and phase in any given direction. Normally only the former is of interest, but the
latter must also be considered when calculating correlation.
The envelope correlation coefﬁcient is always between zero and unity. When zero, the signals
are completely decorrelated (different) and when unity, the signals are completely correlated
(identical).
8.2.3.2 Combining Methods
There are four common diversity combining methods, as follows (in order, with the worst-
performing method ﬁrst and the best last).
r Switched combining (SWC): here a switch is used to receive from one antenna at a time.
When the signal received falls below a certain threshold, the second antenna is used. This
does not guarantee better performance, but it does improve the likelihood. As suggested by
the method, this is also referred to as threshold diversity.
r Selection combining (SC): the antenna with the strongest signal is used. This may be im-
plemented with a single receiver or with two receivers. A single receiver is clearly desirable
from a cost, size and power consumption perspective, however some time must be made
available for the antenna signals to be compared. This is relatively straightforward in digi-
tal, packet-based systems. For example, DECT uses selection combining with the antenna
selection performed in the preamble that occurs before each data packet is sent.
r Equal gain combining (EGC): here two receivers are required and the signals from the
antennas are co-phased prior to summation.
r Maximal ratio combining (MRC): the signals from the antennas are weighted based on
their SNR.
The differences between the methods are quite small for two antennas, as illustrated in
Figure 8.36 for completely decorrelated antenna signals (ρe = 0). In this ﬁgure, the ordinate
(y-axis) shows the probability that the signal-to-noise ratio is less than the level shown on
the abscissa (x-axis) – i.e. the degree of certainty that a predeﬁned signal-to-noise ratio will
be achieved. For example, a CDF (cumulative distribution function) of 10−2 indicates a 99%
probability that a particular signal level is exceeded.
When the CDF is low enough, the curves with diversity in Figure 8.36 become parallel lines
and there is a constant relation between the diversity gains of the three combining methods.
With two branches, EGC performs 0.88 dB better than SC, whereas MRC performs 1.5 dB
better than SC. The diversity gain is substantial for all methods; however, the gain depends on
the chosen certainty level. For example, for a CDF of 10−2, an SNR of better than –20 dB is
always achieved without diversity. With selection combining, an SNR of better than –10 dB is
always achieved with the same level of certainty. Hence, the diversity gain is 10 dB. For lower
levels of certainty (higher CDFs), the diversity gain will be lower than this.
For greater numbers of branches, the difference in diversity gain increases, particularly
between MRC and SC. The variation in the diversity gain of MRC and SC with the number of
branches is shown in Figure 8.37. EGC is not plotted, since an exact formula is not known for
more than two branches.
The difference between SC and MRC with large numbers of branches is largely due to the
fact that MRC with M branches requires M receivers, whereas SC is limited to one receiver.

For all combining methods the mean power varies with the number of diversity branches.
Assuming Rayleigh signal envelope statistics (valid for most multipath environments), zero
correlation and equal branch powers, this variation is shown in Figure 8.38.
Clearly, both MRC and EGC give a linear improvement with the number of diversity
branches. MRC gives the best performance but is only slightly better than EGC. SC is nonlinear

branches is high.
8.2.3.3 The Effect of Branch Correlation
The effect of branch correlation for a two-branch MRC system with Rayleigh signals and equal
branch powers is shown in Figure 8.39.
Figure 8.39 shows that there is some diversity gain even with completely correlated signals.
This is simply a 3 dB gain that results from having two antennas rather than one (collecting
twice as much of the incident energy). An appreciable additional diversity gain occurs at very
high levels of correlation. Decreasing the correlation gives diminishing returns, such that it
is often considered unnecessary to aim for a correlation coefﬁcient of less than 0.5 to 0.7 (a
correlation of 0.7 gives a diversity gain of ∼1.5 dB less than the optimum).

It can be seen that, as the CDF reduces, the curves for different correlation levels reduce at
the same rate. Hence, the difference in diversity gain can be considered to be asymptotically
constant.
8.2.3.4 The Effect of Unequal Branch Powers
The effect of unequal branch power is shown in Figure 8.40. For two branches, the diversity
gain is nominally reduced by half the SNR difference between the branches.

The power received by each antenna is given by the MEG.
8.2.3.5 Examples of Diversity Antennas
An example of two very simple diversity antennas within a DECT base station is shown in
Figure 8.41. Here the base station is relatively large, such that low correlation can be guaranteed
using space diversity: the antennas are separated by approximately 2/3 of a wavelength at the
DECT center frequency of 1890 MHz. Simple quarter-wave wire monopole antennas are used
to minimize costs.
An example of two diversity antennas within a DECT handset is shown in Figure 8.42. Here
the antennas are arranged orthogonally in an attempt to realize polarization diversity. However,
the handset PCB radiates signiﬁcantly – in the same polarization – for both antennas, so the
amount of polarization diversity that can be obtained is limited. Despite this, the differences
in the radiation patterns of the two antennas are sufﬁcient to ensure a usably low envelope

by tracks on the main PCB of the handset.
DECT uses SC with time made available in the preamble prior to packet transmission. IEEE
802.11b (Wi-Fi) also uses SC in a similar way to DECT. However, UMTS uses time diversity
(i.e. there are alternatives to using antennas!).
8.2.3.6 MIMO Antennas
MIMO (multiple-in, multiple-out) antennas are emerging as a new technology to increase
the capacity (data rate) of a communication system, whereas diversity antennas are used for
improving the received signal quality and reliability. From an antenna point of view, MIMO
antennas are similar to diversity antennas; they both require uncorrelated antennas and are
most suitable for multipath environments where signals are random. But MIMO systems

need signiﬁcantly more DSP (digital signal processing) and are much more complicated than
diversity systems [21, 22].
8.2.4 User Interaction
8.2.4.1 Introduction
There is a strong interaction between antennas within portable devices and the user. This
interaction causes the antenna resonant frequency to change – often to a lower frequency – and
the antenna matching to vary. It also causes the antenna efﬁciency to reduce, since the body
acts as a lossy dielectric. The only improvement is in the antenna bandwidth, as we would
expect with reduced efﬁciency (refer to Section 8.1.1).
8.2.4.2 Body Materials
To consider the effect of user interaction on the performance of mobile phone antennas, we
should ﬁrst examine the material properties of the head. The variation of the relative permittivity
of brain material with frequency is shown in Figure 8.43, whereas the loss tangent and skin
depth are shown in Figure 8.44 and Figure 8.45 respectively.
The relative permittivity of brain matter varies slowly from approximately 40 to 50 between
10 and 1 GHz. Below 1 GHz it begins to rise increasingly quickly, reaching a value of approx-
imately 80 at 100 MHz. The loss tangent also rises very quickly as the frequency is reduced
below 1 GHz, reaching approximately 1.3 at 100 MHz. However, in contrast to the permittivity,
the loss tangent is not monotonic and is a minimum at approximately 2.5 GHz.
Figure 8.45 shows that the skin depth rises sharply at frequencies below 1 GHz. The ﬁeld pen-
etrates to a depth of approximately 4.2 cm at the lower GSM frequencies at around 900 MHz,
whereas at the higher GSM frequencies in the region of 1800 MHz, the penetration is approx-
imately 2.7 cm.

8.2.4.3 Typical Losses
The presence of the user affects the antenna performance in three main ways: the impedance
match alters, the radiation efﬁciency is reduced and the MEG (introduced in Section 8.2.2)
varies. Each of these mechanisms is addressed in the paragraphs that follow.
The radiation efﬁciency, ηR, reduces due to the additional losses in the body, particularly the
head and hand. It is deﬁned as the ratio of the power radiated (including all loss in the body)
to the power accepted by the antenna.
The impedance change that occurs when a phone is held causes a change in the mismatch
loss. This is expressed as unity minus the mismatch efﬁciency, |τ |2: the ratio of the power

accepted by the antenna to the power supplied (the difference being the reﬂected power, due
to impedance mismatch).
Figure 8.46 shows the typical mismatch efﬁciency of a mobile phone antenna in the 900 MHz
band and in the presence of 15 different users, all of whom hold the phone in different ways.
It can be seen that for nine users, the phone is not signiﬁcantly detuned. For three users, the
detuning is such that the resonant frequency is just out-of-band, although the band-edge mis-
match efﬁciency remains high. For the remaining three users, the resonant frequency becomes
signiﬁcantly lower than is required, causing low mismatch efﬁciency at the upper band edge.
The total efﬁciency, ηT , is the ratio of the power supplied to the antenna to the integrated
power on a sphere surrounding it (the radiated power). It is equal to the product of the radiation
and mismatch efﬁciencies.
The total efﬁciency, mismatch efﬁciency and mismatch-corrected efﬁciency of four com-
mercial mobile phone antennas (made in around 2000) in free space are shown in Table 8.4.
The results are averaged over the GSM (880 MHz to 960 MHz) and DCS (1710 MHz to 1880
MHz) bands, using frequency steps of 10 MHz and 25 MHz respectively.
It can be seen that the best of these phones achieve average total efﬁciencies of the order of
60% at DCS and 70% at GSM in free space. The helical phone has a particularly poor return

loss at DCS and, therefore, a mismatch efﬁciency of approximately 50%. It is assumed that
the match is improved (to some extent) using circuitry within the handset.
Typical efﬁciencies of dual-band phones in the talk position (held next to the head) are
shown in Table 8.5. The average total efﬁciency is in the region of 3–8% in the 900 MHz
band and 5–11% in the 1800 MHz band. The average radiation efﬁciencies are in the region
of 6–9% and 6–13% in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands respectively. For both frequency bands,
approximately half of the reduction in radiation efﬁciency can be attributed to the losses in the
head, with the other half due to losses in the hand.
There is little difference between the average mismatch efﬁciencies in free space and in the
presence of the user at 1800 MHz. However, for 900 MHz, the difference can be appreciable.
In general, the resonant frequency reduces and the match at resonance deteriorates. However,
the return loss bandwidth generally improves due to the losses induced in the body. In the 1800
MHz band, the net result is that the average stays approximately the same. In the 900 MHz
band, the detuning of the resonant frequency generally outweighs any bandwidth enhancement
caused by additional body loss (also shown in Figure 8.46).
The mean effective gain (MEG) is a function of the total efﬁciency, the radiation pattern
and the multipath propagation statistics. It is the most representative calculable measure of
performance in a real network. Additional loss can result if the radiation pattern changes in the
presence of the body such that it becomes less well matched with the likely angles of arrival
of multipath components than in free space.
The following summary gives the average MEG for 15 users at 920 MHz and 1800 MHz,
calculated using the angle of arrival statistics given in Section 8.2.2. The mean and the standard
deviation are given in Table 8.6 and Table 8.7 respectively.
The MEG is between 2.1% and 4.5%. This is signiﬁcantly lower than the efﬁciency, partly
because angles close to the horizon are most likely and the phones ‘waste power’ by having
high relative gain outside the most likely angles. More importantly, however, the polarization
of the phone radiation (reception) is not well matched to the polarization mix of the scattering
environment.
The average MEG is –14.6 dB for both GSM and DCS. This represents a reduction of 1.8 dB
for GSM and 3.5 dB for DCS when compared to the average efﬁciency. Clearly the radiation
patterns at GSM must be better matched to the average propagation environment than at DCS.
Figure 8.47 shows the positioning of the users relative to the coordinate system chosen.
Figure 8.48 shows the user-averaged radiation pattern of the ﬂip phone, i.e. the gain at each
angle is averaged for the 15 users. All users are right-handed, so only one average radiation

pattern is required. Clearly, there is more power in the φ polarization than in the θ polarization.
This is expected, due to the inclination of the phone when in a natural talking position. The
blocking region of the head is clearly visible in the negative x, negative y direction. Negative
x corresponds to the user’s left-hand side, while negative y corresponds to the user’s back.
The left- and right-hand sides of the ﬁgure show the radiation pattern viewed from opposite
directions in order to better show its 3D nature.
Figure 8.49 shows the user-averaged radiation pattern of PIFA-1. Again, the phone is pre-
dominantly φ polarized, but more so than for the ﬂip phone. Both θ and φ polarizations have
signiﬁcant lobes in a near-zenith direction (along the positive z-axis). There is unlikely to be
a propagation path supported in this direction, which also contributes to the inferior MEG
performance of PIFA-1. Without this lobe, there is very little energy in the θ polarization. The
propagation statistics used assume that this is the dominant polarization coming from the base
station (via a scattering environment), which, again, results in low MEG. Assuming that the
dominant polarization is θ directed implies a vertically polarized base-station antenna. It is
worth noting that, as polarization diversity with slant 45◦polarized antennas is becoming more
common at the base station, this assumption may be questionable.

8.3 Multiband and Ultra-Wideband Antennas
8.3.1 Introduction
Many modern communication systems have to work well over multiple frequency bands. For
example, a well-designed cellular mobile phone is normally expected to operate in at least the
two GSM bands (900 MHz and 1800 MHz) and the PCS band (1900 MHz). The recent release
of the UWB band (from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz) for wireless low-power applications has generated a
lot of interest in developing UWB systems [23, 24]. In this section we are going to deal with
these two types of antennas.
8.3.2 Multiband Antennas
8.3.2.1 Techniques
Several basic principles can be employed to realize multiband antennas, as follows:
r use higher order resonances;
r use resonant traps;
r combine resonant structures;
r use parasitic resonators.
Each will be addressed in the sections that follow.
Higher Order Resonances
The use of higher order resonances is illustrated in Figure 8.51, which shows the resonant
modes of monopole antennas as their length is increased in λ/4 increments.

and current density magnitudes respectively

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
Monopoles are often used with a length of λ/4 when the E ﬁeld at the feed is a minimum
and the current is a maximum. A similar condition exists at the feed when the antenna is 3λ/4.
Alternatively, we can say that, for a ﬁxed antenna height, the feed conditions will be similar
when the frequency is equivalent to heights of λ/4 and 3λ/4: the antenna will be resonant at a
ﬁrst frequency and then a second frequency three times the ﬁrst. Other natural resonances will
also exist at higher frequencies.
Higher order resonances are present in many types of resonant antennas such as patches,
dipoles, monopoles, slots and dielectric resonators and are often used (and manipulated) to
give multiband operation.
Resonant Traps
Figure 8.52 shows a monopole antenna with a parallel resonant circuit – or trap – located ap-
proximately halfway along its length. The trap enables the antenna to work at two frequencies:
a low frequency, f1, and a higher frequency, f2. At f2 the trap is tuned to be close to anti-
resonance (a high impedance) and current ﬂow is restricted to the lower part of the antenna;
resonance is achieved when the lower part of the antenna is close to λ/4 long. In practice,
this resonance is achieved when this part is slightly less than λ/4 and the trap is anti-resonant
at a slightly lower frequency than f2. At f1 the trap is well below resonance and is inductive,
and the antenna is resonant when the full length is close to λ/4. Again, due to the shortening
effect of the inductor, in practice resonance is achieved at a length that is slightly less than λ/4.
Radio amateurs use traps in dipole antennas located horizontally above ground, for example
to cover the 80 and 40 meter bands (3.5 to 4.0 MHz and 7.0 to 7.3 MHz respectively). They
are also often used in automotive antennas.
Combined Resonant Structures
Two or more resonant structures can be closely located or even co-located with a single
feed point in order to achieve multiband operation. This is illustrated in Figure 8.53(a), which
shows two closely spaced, adjacently located monopoles with a common feed point. The larger
element is operational at the lower frequency, f1, whereas the smaller element is operational
at the higher frequency, f2.

Combined resonant structures
Figure 8.53(b) works using the same principle; however, the low-frequency element is
realized using a helical element to reduce space (the high-frequency element is within the
helix for some of its length).
Parasitic Resonators
In contrast to the previous section, we may add a second element for operation at a second
frequency, but without feeding it directly. This is illustrated in Figure 8.54, which shows two
monopoles, one of which is fed, whereas the other is parasitically coupled via the near ﬁeld of
the fed antenna. Here the parasitic antenna is shown with a load, which can be used for tuning.
Usually, the load would be reactive in order to maintain high antenna efﬁciency.
8.3.2.2 Examples
The ﬁrst example uses the principle of higher order resonances. Figure 8.55 shows a simple
normal mode helix antenna mounted on a PCB of typical mobile phone dimensions. The
antenna is ﬁrst resonant at a frequency, f1, of approximately 0.84 GHz, with a resistance of

high and the reactance makes the transition from being positive to negative). The antenna then
becomes resonant again at a frequency, f2, of approximately 2.15 GHz – when the resistance
is 10 ohms – before quickly becoming anti-resonant again at approximately 2.35 GHz. The
ratio between the ﬁrst and second resonant frequencies is given by
f1
f2
= 2.6
(8.57)
This is close to the value of three that we would expect for resonances at electrical lengths
of λ/4 and 3λ/4 (as illustrated in Figure 8.51).
Since the antenna shown in Figure 8.55 is electrically small, the reactance can be seen to
vary quickly at the ﬁrst resonance and even more quickly at the second resonance. This is
indicative of narrow bandwidth.
For dual-band mobile phones, the antenna resistance is normally required to be close to 50
ohms and the frequency ratio is close to two. A simple method of altering the frequency ratio is
to have different helix pitches in the upper and lower portions of the antenna. This is illustrated
in Figure 8.56 for a commercial dual-band helix. The low-frequency resonance is controlled
by the overall length of the structure, whilst the high-frequency resonance is controlled by the
pitch of the upper part of the antenna.
Alternatively, Figure 8.57 illustrates a dual-band helical antenna in which two windings of
different pitches and lengths are integrated into a single volume with a common feed – an
example of combined resonant structures.
8.3.3 Wideband Antennas
There is a wide variety of wideband antennas, many of which are also electrically large. Here
we focus on wideband antennas that are also electrically relatively small, since this is often an
industrial requirement.

The basic approach to making an electrically small antenna wideband is to make it fat.
We saw previously in Section 8.1.1 that the bandwidth of an antenna is related to the size
of the sphere that just encloses it. By making the antenna fat, more of the sphere is occu-
pied and the antenna bandwidth can be maximized. Some typical fat monopoles are illus-
trated in Figure 8.58. These and other similar shapes have formed the basis for UWB antenna
designs.
UWB antennas are normally planar. However, as an example of what happens to the feed
impedance when an antenna is ‘fattened’, we will concentrate on a three-dimensional con-
ical monopole, which subtends an angle α at the feed. The resistance of such an antenna
with height and ﬂare angle is shown in Figure 8.59. When the monopole is thin – i.e. for
α = 10◦– there is a strong resistance peak at approximately 124 degrees. For a very thin
monopole, this peak would occur at 180 degrees, when the antenna is half-wave. However, as

the ﬂare angle increases, the half-wave peak occurs at progressively lower electrical heights
and with a decreasing resistance value. When the ﬂare angle reaches 90 degrees, the resistance
is close to 50 ohms over a wide range of electrical heights. If the electrical height is greater
than approximately 50 degrees, the resistance is close to 50 ohms over a wide frequency
range.
The reactance of the conical monopole with height and ﬂare angle is shown in Figure 8.60.
As α is increased, the reactance variation reduces and is close to zero for heights greater than
90 degrees. For heights greater than 50 degrees, the reactance is within, or capable of being
matched to within, acceptable limits.
We can conclude that monopole antennas with wide ﬂare angles can exhibit near-constant
resistance with electrical heights greater than approximately 50 degrees. In other words, small,
fat antennas can exhibit wideband characteristics. Some UWB antennas have been developed
based on this idea [24]. For example, two UWB antennas are shown in Figure 2.34 and the
S11 of Antenna 1 is given in Figure 8.61, which has a return loss greater than 10 dB over the
UWB band.

8.4 RFID Antennas
8.4.1 Introduction
Radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) systems are short-range – normally digital – wireless
systems that, as the name suggests, are used primarily for identiﬁcation purposes [25]. Exam-
ples of applications include: animal tagging, asset tracking, electronic passports, smartcards
and shop security. A simpliﬁed diagram of an RFID system is shown in Figure 8.62.

A simpliﬁed RFID system
At one end of the radio link is a small device with limited intelligence: the tag or transponder.
Tags are designed for manufacture in very large volumes at very low cost. They can be likened
to bar-code labels: they have an electronic product code (EPC), comparable to the universal
product code (UPC) format used by bar codes, but they are also programmable and have the
capability to store user-speciﬁc information (i.e. they contain some user memory). Tags contain
an integrated circuit (IC) that is connected to a thin planar sheet that serves as a label and as a
substrate for the antenna. The tag antenna is normally balanced (to suit the differential inputs
of the tag IC), electrically small and linearly polarized.
At the other end of the link is a more expensive and sophisticated device: the reader or
interrogator. These commonly used names reﬂect the fact that the primary jobs of the reader
are to prompt communication with the tags (often with several tags simultaneously) and then
to receive data from them. However, contrary to the name, the reader often also transfers data,
or writes, to the tag. Before prompting the tag to respond, the reader also often supplies it with
power; this helps to reduce the cost of the tags, since a battery is expensive to supply, connect
and maintain.
There are several classes of tag, dependent on how they generate enough power to commu-
nicate, as follows:
r passive;
r semi-active;
r active.
Passive tags are very low in cost but tend to be limited in terms of range and data rate.
They can only respond once powered by the reader, which may take some time. Semi-active

Special Topics
341
tags have a limited power supply, which allows faster operation. Active tags have enough
on-board battery power to allow ‘broadcast’ of their presence to readers and high data rate
communications.
The reader may be either monostatic, where transmission and reception uses the same
antenna, or bistatic, where the transmission and reception antennas (and associated circuitry)
are separate (as shown in Figure 8.62 with the second antenna used for receive only). The ﬁrst
and second antennas may also both be used for transmit and receive, for example where the
reader antennas are installed on either side of a ‘gate’ through which tags pass (commonly
used in shop security systems).
The reader antenna is generally electrically larger than the tag antenna and may be either
balanced or unbalanced. Many different types of antenna can be utilized, with radiation patterns
and polarization tailored for the particular application. Reader antennas are often circularly
polarized when the orientation of the tag is unknown. While this reduces the maximum possible
power transfer between the reader and the tag (there is a 3 dB coupling loss between circularly
and linearly polarized antennas), it eliminates any likelihood that polarizations could be com-
pletely mismatched. This is important in tagging applications, where reliability is required to
be very high.
Figure 8.63 shows a typical sequence of events for a passive tag to be identiﬁed by a reader.
First, the tag transmits a continuous wave (CW) signal that is received by nearby tags. This
signal is rectiﬁed to provide enough power to operate the tag. The reader then sends a modulated
request for active tags (i.e. tags close enough to the reader to be powered up) to respond. This
is followed by a response from the appropriate tag. Tag modulation is achieved by switching
the load impedance seen at the terminals of the tag antenna. This causes the tag antenna to
alter the ﬁeld seen at the reader antenna. Although the change is very small, it can be detected
and demodulated by the reader. In this way, the tag uses as little power as possible in order to
maximize the read range: it does not generate a signal, but simply provides enough power to
activate a switch.

Antennas: From Theory to Practice
RFID systems operate at a number of frequency bands that can be grouped as follows:
r low frequency (LF);
r high frequency (HF);
r ultra high frequency (UHF).
There are large differences in the frequencies used in the LF, MF and UHF bands. Because
of this, there are also signiﬁcant differences in the way in which the systems operate and in
the applications for which they are appropriate.
LF and HF systems use near-ﬁeld coupling between the tag and the reader antennas: most
often the coupling is inductive, but it may also be capacitive. When inductive coupling is used,
both the reader and the tag typically use multi-turn coils as antennas. In fact, referring to these
coils as antennas is a little misleading, since the coils of the reader and tag act more like
transformers: the coil of the reader can be considered to be the primary winding and the coil of
the tag acts as the secondary. The coupling between the coils (and therefore the transformation
ratio) is dependent on their separation and always occurs within the near-ﬁeld region (where
the magnetic ﬁeld falls with the inverse of distance to the power of three). Near-ﬁeld systems
are discussed in detail in Section 8.4.2. They are used particularly in applications where the
tag may be attached to a lossy dielectric such as a ﬂuid-ﬁlled bottle, an animal or a solid object.
This is because the tag antenna electrical characteristics tend to change less than for far-ﬁeld
(UHF) antennas.
UHF systems generally use far-ﬁeld coupling, when the antennas of the reader and tag
operate in a more conventional way: the transfer of energy is determined by the Friis equation
(see Section 3.5.1). UHF far-ﬁeld systems typically have greater range than LF and HF systems.
As such, they are often used in systems where higher than normal levels of performance are
required. They are described in greater detail in Section 8.4.3.
8.4.2 Near-Field Systems
For near-ﬁeld systems, loop/coil antennas are normally used for the reader and the tag. Consider
the simple reader loop shown in Figure 8.64, where a is the reader loop radius, b is the tag
loop radius and d is the separation between the tag and reader loops. Close to the reader the
magnetic ﬁeld produced is greatest along the axis of the loop: the z-axis as drawn. Hence,
products are often arranged so that the reader and tag loops have the same axis, as shown.
With such an alignment, the mutual inductance, M, between the loops is given by [26]

E(D) and K(D) are complete elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst and second kind, respectively. These
formulas indicate that there is an optimum relationship between the sizes of the tag and loop
antennas that should be considered at a system design stage.
A typical practical near-ﬁeld system is shown in Figure 8.65. Here the tag antenna size and
geometry is normally limited by the application: for example, credit card dimensions are often
used for smart cards. Multi-turn loops are also often employed, when the mutual inductance
increases linearly with the number of turns.

Mutual coupling between reader and tag coils
The transfer of energy between the reader and the tag is via the mutual coupling be-
tween the two loops. The equivalent circuit of two mutually coupled inductors is shown in
Figure 8.66.
The circuit on the left of Figure 8.66 represents the reader, whereas the circuit on the right
represents the tag. The transfer of energy that occurs between the two coils is modeled by
two current-dependent voltage sources connected in series with the coil inductances. These
sources depend on the level of mutual coupling, which varies with the distance between
the tag and reader. The mutual coupling is typically low, such that the reader current can be
consideredtobeapproximatelyconstant.Thisallowsthetagtobeanalyzedindependentlyofthe
reader.
In addition to its inductance, the tag loop will have some associated loss resistance and some
inter-turn capacitance, which is most simply approximated by a shunt capacitor. The tag IC
will have a load resistance and a capacitance that is designed to be appropriate for certain loop
dimensions and frequency ranges. The IC is normally modeled as either a series or parallel
equivalent circuit. The equivalent circuits of a practical tag inductor and a tag IC are shown in
Figure 8.67.

the system easier to analyze, it is necessary to obtain a completely series or parallel equivalent
circuit. This can be done easily by using Norton or Thevenin equivalents as appropriate. In
the example that follows we will convert components to the left of A–A to a Norton (parallel)
equivalent circuit. To do this, we short-circuit any independent voltage sources (the source in
Figure 8.66 can be considered independent if the mutual coupling is low and I1 can, therefore,
be considered to be constant) and determine the impedance looking into the circuit at A–A.
We also short-circuit the terminals at A–A, where the current becomes that of the equivalent
Norton current source. The Norton impedance is given by R2 + jωL2. To convert this to parallel
connected components we use the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 8.68.
Series-connected resistance and reactance, RS and X S respectively, can be represented at a
single frequency by a shunt-connected resistance and reactance, RP and X P respectively. The
relationships between components are

where RT is the combined resistance of R2P in parallel with RIC,

Again this is a maximum at the resonant frequency given by Equation (8.65). At resonance,
and for a given reader current and tag-to-reader separation, the voltage is predominantly de-
pendent on RT , which, in turn, is usually dominated by the resistance of the tag coil, R2P.
This means that the read range (or the range over which there is a voltage great enough to be
rectiﬁed) is determined by the tag coil quality.
LF and HF tag ICs are designed to have a capacitive input impedance that can be made to
resonate with a typical tag coil. Note that tag ICs are normally complementary metal oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) devices, which are inherently capacitive. When resonant, the tags
produce a high voltage that is then rectiﬁed in order to provide a DC power supply to the rest of
the tag IC. Once powered, the tag is able to switch its input impedance in order to produce an
impedance change at the reader coil. Normally, switching is between the inherent capacitive
reactance of the tag IC and a short circuit – an open circuit is seldom used in passive tags due
to the high input voltage that could be generated. The impedance change that occurs at the
terminals of the reader antenna can be detected by measuring the change in voltage or current
that occurs. Hence, digital information can be transferred from the tag to the reader.
A typical rectangular tag antenna is shown in Figure 8.70.
The inductance of coils of the type shown in Figure 8.70 can be approximated by the formulas

These formulas can be used as a starting point for a design. Any ﬁnal design is likely
to be simulated using a 2.5D or 3D electromagnetic simulator, so that the effects of ﬁnite
conductivity, dielectric materials, etc. can be accounted for.
An example of a commercial coil antenna – used in a European passport – is shown in Figure
8.71. The antenna has ﬁve turns formed using thin wires. The chip is connected to a metallic
strap prior to connection to the coil. The IC is also embedded in a relatively thick layer of
insulating material. This prevents the IC from being damaged and also prevents the coil from
being excessively bent.
8.4.3 Far-Field Systems
Systems with carrier frequencies above 100 MHz generally operate by transferring power in
the far ﬁeld. The most commonly used frequency bands are in the region of 900 MHz, though
the ISM band centered at 2.45 GHz is also used (this band is sometimes termed microwave
rather than UHF). Some typical frequency bands for different parts of the world are indicated
in Table 8.9.
Note that for worldwide operation in the region of 900 MHz, a wide frequency range –
approximately 860 to 960 MHz – is required. This means that the antenna must be relatively
wideband, with a fractional bandwidth of approximately 11%. Because of this, the antenna Q

trade-off between bandwidth of operation and range.
A typical far-ﬁeld system is shown in Figure 8.72. In contrast to near-ﬁeld systems, coil
antennas are rarely used in far-ﬁeld systems. Indeed, a wide variety of antennas is possible.
Dipoles, PIFAs and patches are amongst the options at the reader. Patches are often used to
provide circular polarization (as illustrated in Figure 8.72): this helps to make the communi-
cation with an arbitrarily oriented, linearly polarized tag antenna less variable. Tag antennas
are rarely circularly polarized (the cost of fabrication is prohibitively high); modiﬁed dipoles
are most commonly used.
The transfer of energy between far-ﬁeld antennas can be evaluated by consideration of Figure
8.73.

For the tag to operate effectively, it must receive enough power from the tag to ‘power up’
and it must be capable of providing sufﬁcient modulation for the reader to detect. Both depend
on the power of the reader, the antenna gains, the polarization matching between the reader and
tag antennas and the mismatch between the tag antenna and the associated IC. The former also
depends on the power required to energize the tag, PCHIP, whereas the latter also depends on
the effectiveness of the load switching and the sensitivity of the reader. The reader sensitivity
is easier to improve than the power required to energize the tag, since the reader is a more
elaborate and expensive device. Hence, the range, d, of the system is normally determined by
the minimum power required by the tag IC, given by
d =

PCHIP
(8.77)
To improve range, tag ICs are designed to have the lowest possible PCHIP. The range of a
commercial device is calculated in the following example. A typical tag IC has an equivalent
series input resistance of 10 – j245 ohms. The tag antenna is designed such that its impedance
is as close as possible to the complex conjugate of the chip input impedance (or the impedance
at which the tag rectiﬁcation efﬁciency is greatest). Hence, an antenna impedance of 10 +
j245 ohms is required. The resistance is low, which conveniently suits electrically small an-
tennas such as dipoles operated well below half a wavelength. However, the required inductive
reactance does not suit small dipoles: such antennas are normally capacitive. Fortunately, it is
straightforward to modify the impedance of a dipole in order to make it inductive. A simple
technique is to use a shunt feed, as illustrated in Figure 8.74. The length of the dipole, l1, is
less than λ/2, giving a low resistance and a capacitive reactance. The shunt arms provide both
an impedance transformation (increasing both the resistance and the capacitive reactance) and
a shunt inductance, the combination of which can be used to transform the antenna impedance
to the desired value. The impedance transformation is predominantly determined by the ratio
of w2 to w1 (the higher this ratio, the greater the transformation). The shunt inductance is
predominantly determined by the length l2(though w1, w2 and s1 also have some inﬂuence).
Variations of the shunt-fed dipole, shown in Figure 8.74, are often used in practice.

8.5 Reconﬁgurable Antennas
8.5.1 Introduction
Work has been performed on reconﬁgurable antennas for many years [29]. As the term suggests,
reconﬁgurable antennas employ some form of variability – often by using switches, variable
components or moving parts – to change the resonant frequency, radiation pattern and/or
impedance match.
For mobile radio, moves towards software-deﬁned radios (SDRs) are driving research on
reconﬁgurable antennas [30]. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – an indepen-
dent United States government agency that regulates radio communications – deﬁnition of an
SDR is as follows [31]:
‘a radio that includes a transmitter in which the operating parameters of the transmitter, including
the frequency range, modulation type or maximum radiated or conducted output power can be
altered by making a change in software without making any hardware changes.’
There are many ways of reconﬁguring an antenna, including:
r resonant mode switching/tuning (via shorting, reactive loading);
r feed network switching/tuning;
r mechanical reconﬁguration (with moving parts!)
Each of these methods is considered in the sections that follow. However, it is useful to ﬁrst
consider what switching and variable components are available.
8.5.2 Switching and Variable-Component Technologies
Figure 8.75 shows a simpliﬁed equivalent circuit of a switch. In the ‘ON’ state, the switch can
be represented by a simple resistor, whereas in the ‘OFF’ state, it can be characterized by a
series capacitor. For many switches, this capacitor is not lossless, so a parallel resistance is
included to indicate that the capacitor has a ﬁnite quality factor, Q.
The insertion loss of single-pole, single-throw and series-connected, single-pole, dual-throw
(SPDT) switches is determined primarily by the ‘ON’ resistance, RON. The isolation is pre-
dominantly determined by the ‘OFF’ capacitance, COFF. Generally, there is a trade-off between

RON and COFF such that their product, RONCOFF is constant for a particular technology and
DC power supply. Hence, the isolation is usually improved at the expense of insertion loss and
vice versa.
Table 8.10 gives a comparison of some switch technologies: PIN diodes, Gallium Arsenide
(GaAs) and Indium Phosphide (InP) ﬁeld effect transistors (FETS) and micro electromechan-
ical systems (MEMS).
PIN diodes have been used with good results in many applications. They have the advantage
of potentially low ‘ON’ resistance, but this comes at the cost of high current consumption,
which is a disadvantage for low-power applications – in particular, for portable devices such as
mobile phones. PIN diodes can have a reasonable isolation, but this requires a large negative
bias. Again, this is inconvenient in portable devices, where voltages of between around 0 and
3 V are available.
GaAs and InP FETs have become increasingly popular in portable devices such as mobile
phones because they offer low current consumption. Though the RONCOFF product of GaAs
and InP FETs is approximately the same as for PIN diodes, FETs cannot handle large voltages
and are, hence, often used in series. This increases RON and reduces COFF and often means
that switches made with GaAs and InP FETs have higher ‘ON’ resistances and lower ‘OFF’
capacitances than their PIN-based equivalents.
MEMS devices are in their commercial infancy. They can be likened to miniature relays
where metal-to-metal contacts are made and broken by the application (or absence) of an
electrostatic ﬁeld (in contrast to reed relays, where actuation is via a magnetic ﬁeld). Unlike

Figure 8.76
Fabrication detail of a typical MEMS switch
conventional relays, MEMS devices are very small and are fabricated (as far as is possible)
using processes that are normally used to manufacture low-cost integrated circuits. Figure
8.76 shows an example. This manufacturing technique, coupled with near lossless ‘ON’ and
‘OFF’ states – with metal-to-metal contacts and an air gap respectively – makes MEMS-based
switches highly attractive for future applications. The main drawback of MEMS devices is that
they typically require high DC actuation voltages.
Switches are not the only components that can be used to make reconﬁgurable antennas.
If large components can be tolerated, mechanically variable inductors and capacitors can be
utilized. For example, variable capacitors – where rotary motors provide the variation – are
widely used within high-power antenna-tuning units in the MF and HF bands. On a smaller
scale, varactor diodes may be used, though they generally suffer from poor linearity and are
therefore limited to low-power applications. Active devices may also be used, for example as
variable inductors or capacitors. The main drawbacks of doing so are that the active devices
consume power, add noise and are often nonlinear. In the future, MEMs devices may also
be used as variable capacitors, though they tend to have rather nonlinear capacitance curves
with DC voltage. MEMS devices may also be used, not as galvanic switches (where a metal-
to-metal contact is made), but as capacitive switches with a high ‘ON’ to ‘OFF’ capacitance
ratio. This avoids problems associated with the ‘sticking’ and wear of very small metallic
contacts.
8.5.3 Resonant Mode Switching/Tuning
Figure 8.77 shows an example of resonant mode tuning, where a PIFA antenna is tuned by
a variable capacitor. As the capacitance value is increased, the antenna resonant frequency is
reduced (with the penalty of reduced bandwidth). The capacitor is located at the point on the

capacitor
Figure 8.77
A side view of a PIFA antenna that is tuned by a variable capacitance
antenna where the electric ﬁeld is highest, which gives the highest possible resonant frequency
tuning ratio for a given capacitance variation.
For physically large (low-frequency) applications, the capacitor could be a mechanically
variable capacitor; for low-power applications or applications where high degrees of linear-
ity are not required, it could be a varactor diode. Alternatively, discrete variability could be
provided by switched capacitors.
8.5.4 Feed Network Switching/Tuning
Antennas can be reconﬁgured either on the antenna itself (as in the previous section) or by
modifying the circuitry feeding the antenna. An obvious example of the latter is the phased
array. Here, the phases and amplitudes of the signals applied to each element of the array can be
modiﬁed. In turn, this can alter the antenna radiation pattern in terms of its angle of maximum
gain, the value of the gain and the pattern shape.
8.5.5 Mechanical Reconﬁguration
Figure 8.78 shows an example of mechanical reconﬁguration [32]. A ‘V’-shaped dipole is
implemented and a MEMS micro-hinge is used to vary the angle of the V. This allows the
antenna to beam-steer.

8.6 Summary
In this chapter we have discussed ﬁve special topics: electrically small antennas, mobile anten-
nas, multiband and UWB antennas, RFID antennas and reconﬁgurable antennas. An in-depth
study of electrically small antennas was conducted. The focus was on impedance bandwidth
theory and broadening techniques. Antenna diversity and user interaction were also dealt with,
both in theory and by studying practical examples. As new wireless systems are emerging all
the time, there are always demands for smarter and/or smaller antennas.
