THE LANGUAGE LIBRARY
Series editor: David Crystal
The Language Library was created in 1952 by Eric Partridge, the great etymologist
and lexicographer, who from 1966 to 1976 was assisted by his co-editor Simeon
Potter. Together they commissioned volumes on the traditional themes of language
study, with particular emphasis on the history of the English language and on
the individual linguistic styles of major English authors. In 1977 David Crystal
took over as editor, and The Language Library now includes titles in many
areas of linguistic enquiry.

Preface to
the Sixth Edition
When I took the ﬁrst survey of my undertaking, I found our speech copious
without order, and energetick without rules: wherever I turned my view,
there was perplexity to be disentangled, and confusion to be regulated; choice
was to be made out of boundless variety, without any established principle
of selection; adulterations were to be detected, without a settled test of purity;
and modes of expression to be rejected or received, without the suffrages
of any writers of classical reputation or acknowledged authority.
Samuel Johnson, ‘Preface’ to A Dictionary of the English Language
One sign of immaturity [in a science] is the endless ﬂow of terminology.
The critical reader begins to wonder if some strange naming taboo attaches
to the terms that a linguist uses, whereby when he dies they must be buried
with him.
Dwight Bolinger, Aspects of Language, p. 554
It is over twenty-ﬁve years since the ﬁrst edition of this book, and the plaint
with which I began the preface to that edition remains as valid as ever. What is
needed, I said then, is a comprehensive lexicographical survey, on historical
principles, of twentieth-century terminology in linguistics and phonetics. And
I continued, in that and the subsequent four prefaces, in the following way.
We could use the techniques, well established, which have provided dictionaries
of excellence, such as the Oxford English Dictionary. The painstaking scrutiny
of texts from a range of contexts, the recording of new words and senses on
slips, and the systematic correlation of these as a preliminary to representing
patterns of usage: such steps are routine for major surveys of general vocabulary
and could as readily be applied for a specialized vocabulary, such as the present
undertaking. Needless to say, it would be a massive task – and one which, for
linguistics and phonetics, has frequently been initiated, though without much
progress. I am aware of several attempts to work along these lines, in Canada,
Great Britain, Japan and the United States, sometimes by individuals, some-
times by committees. All seem to have foundered, presumably for a mixture of
organizational and ﬁnancial reasons. I tried to initiate such a project myself,
twice, but failed both times, for the same reasons. The need for a proper linguistics

dictionary is thus as urgent now as it ever was; but to be fulﬁlled it requires a
combination of academic expertise, time, physical resources and ﬁnance which
so far have proved impossible to attain.
But how to cope, in the meantime, with the apparently ‘endless ﬂow of
terminology’ which Bolinger, among many others, laments? And how to deal
with the enquiries from the two kinds of consumer of linguistic and phonetic
terms? For this surely is the peculiar difﬁculty which linguists have always had
to face – that their subject, despite its relative immaturity, carries immense
popular as well as academic appeal. Not only, therefore, is terminology a problem
for the academic linguist and phonetician; these days, such people are far
outnumbered by those who, for private or professional reasons, have developed
more than an incidental interest in the subject. It is of little use intimating that
the interest of the outside world is premature, as has sometimes been suggested.
The interest exists, in a genuine, responsible and critical form, and requires a
comparably responsible academic reaction. The present dictionary is, in the ﬁrst
instance, an attempt to meet that popular demand for information about linguistic
terms, pending the fuller, academic evaluation of the subject’s terminology which
one day may come.
The demand has come mainly from those for whom a conscious awareness of
language is an integral part of the exercise of a profession, and upon whom the
inﬂuence of linguistics has been making itself increasingly felt in recent years.
This characterization includes two main groups: the range of teaching and
remedial language professions, such as foreign-language teaching or speech and
language therapy; and the range of academic ﬁelds which study language as part
of their concerns, such as psychology, anthropology, sociology, literary criticism
and philosophy. It also includes an increasing number of students of linguistics
– especially those who are taking introductory courses in the subject at
postgraduate or in-service levels. In addition, there are the many categories of
ﬁrst-year undergraduate students of linguistics and phonetics, and (especially
since the early 1990s) a corresponding growth in the numbers studying the
subject abroad. My aim, accordingly, is to provide a tool which will assist these
groups in their initial coming to grips with linguistic terminology, and it is this
which motivated the original title of the book in 1980: A First Dictionary of
Linguistics and Phonetics. The publisher dropped the word First from later
editions, on the grounds that it had little force, given that there was no ‘advanced’
dictionary for students to move on to; but, though my book has doubled in size
during the intervening period, it still seems as far away from a comprehensive
account as it did at the outset. Bolinger’s comment still very much obtains.
Coverage
Once a decision about readership had been made, the problem of selecting items
and senses for inclusion simpliﬁed considerably. It is not the case that the whole
of linguistic terminology, and all schools of thought, have proved equally attractive
or useful to the above groups. Some terms have been used (and abused) far more
than others. For example, competence, lexis, generate, structuralism,
morphology and prosody are a handful which turn up so often in a student’s
early experience of the subject that their exclusion would have been unthinkable.
Preface to the Sixth Edition

The terminology of phonetics, also, is so pervasive that it is a priority for special
attention. On the other hand, there are many highly specialized terms which
are unlikely to cause any problems for my intended readership, as they will
not encounter them in their initial contact with linguistic ideas. The detailed
terminology of, say, glossematics or stratiﬁcational grammar has not made much
of an impact on the general consciousness of the above groups. While I have
included several of the more important theoretical terms from these less widely
encountered approaches, therefore, I have not presented their terminology in
any detail. Likewise, some linguistic theories and descriptions have achieved far
greater popularity than others – generative grammar, in all its incarnations,
most obviously, and (in Great Britain) Hallidayan linguistics and the Quirk
reference grammar, for example.
The biases of this dictionary, I hope, will be seen to be those already present
in the applied and introductory literature – with a certain amount of systematiza-
tion and ﬁlling-out in places, to avoid gaps in the presentation of a topic; for
example, whereas many introductory texts selectively illustrate distinctive
features, this topic has been systematically covered in the present book. I
devote a great deal of space to the many ‘harmless-looking’ terms which are
used by linguists, where an apparently everyday word has developed a special
sense, often after years of linguistic debate, such as form, function, feature,
accent, word and sentence. These are terms which, perhaps on account of
their less technical appearance, cause especial difﬁculty at an introductory level.
Particular attention is paid to them in this dictionary, therefore, alongside the
more obvious technical terms, such as phoneme, bilabial, adjunction and
hyponymy.
Bearing in mind the background of my primary readership has helped to
simplify the selection of material for inclusion in a second way: the focus was
primarily on those terms and senses which have arisen because of the inﬂuence
of twentieth-century linguistics and phonetics. This dictionary is therefore in
contrast with several others, where the aim seems to have been to cover the
whole ﬁeld of language, languages and communication, as well as linguistics and
phonetics. My attitude here is readily summarized: I do not include terms whose
sense any good general dictionary would routinely handle, such as alphabet and
aphorism. As terms, they owe nothing to the development of ideas in linguistics.
Similarly, while such terms as runic and rhyme-scheme are more obviously
technical, their special ranges of application derive from conceptual frameworks
other than linguistics. I have therefore not attempted to take on board the huge
terminological apparatus of classical rhetoric and literary criticism (in its focus
on language), or the similarly vast terminology of speech and language disorders.
Nor have I gone down the encyclopedia road, adding names of people, languages
and other ‘proper names’, apart from in the few cases where schools of thought
have developed (chomskyan, bloomﬁeldian, prague school, etc.). Many of
these terms form the subject-matter of my companion volume, The Penguin
Dictionary of Language (1999), which is the second edition of a work that
originally appeared as An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Language and Languages
(Blackwell/Penguin, 1992).
In the ﬁrst edition, to keep the focus sharp on the contemporary subject, I was
quite rigorous about excluding several types of term, unless they had edged their
way into modern linguistics: the terminology of traditional (pre-twentieth-century)

Preface to the Sixth Edition

language study, comparative philology, applied language studies (such as language
teaching and speech pathology) and related domains such as acoustics, informa-
tion theory, audiology, logic and philosophy. However, reader feedback over
the years has made it clear that a broader coverage is desirable. Although the
deﬁnition of, say, bandwidth properly belongs outside of linguistics and phonetics,
the frequency with which students encounter the term in their phonetics reading
has motivated its inclusion now. A similar broadening of interest has taken
place with reference to psychology (especially speech perception), computing
and logic (especially in formal semantics). The ﬁrst edition had already included
the ﬁrst tranche of terms arising out of the formalization of ideas initiated by
Chomsky (such as axiom, algorithm, proposition), the ﬁfth edition greatly
increased its coverage in this area, and the sixth has continued this process, with
especial reference to the minimalist programme. Recent decades have also brought
renewed interest in nineteenth-century philological studies and traditional
grammar. The various editions of the book have steadily increased their coverage
of these domains, accordingly (though falling well short of a comprehensive
account), and this was a particular feature of the ﬁfth edition.
The new edition is now not far short of a quarter of a million words. It
contains over 5,100 terms, identiﬁed by items in boldface typography, grouped
into over 3,000 entries. Several other locutions, derived from these headwords,
are identiﬁed through the use of inverted commas.
Treatment
I remain doubtful even now whether the most appropriate title for this book
is ‘dictionary’. The deﬁnitional parts of the entries, by themselves, were less
illuminating than one might have expected; consequently it proved necessary to
introduce in addition a more discursive approach, with several illustrations, to
capture the signiﬁcance of a term. Most entries accordingly contain an element
of encyclopedic information, often about such matters as the historical context
in which a term was used, or the relationship between a term and others from
associated ﬁelds. At times, owing to the absence of authoritative studies of
terminological development in linguistics, I have had to introduce a personal
interpretation in discussing a term; but usually I have obtained my information
from standard expositions or (see below) specialists. A number of general reference
works were listed as secondary sources for further reading in the early editions
of this book, but this convention proved unwieldy to introduce for all entries, as
the size of the database grew, and was dropped in the fourth edition.
My focus throughout has been on standard usage. Generative grammar, in
particular, is full of idiosyncratic terminology devised by individual scholars to
draw attention to particular problems; one could ﬁll a whole dictionary with the
hundreds of conditions and constraints that have been proposed over the years,
many of which are now only of historical interest. If they attracted a great deal
of attention in their day, they have been included; but I have not tried to
maintain a historical record of origins, identifying the originators of terms,
except in those cases where a whole class of terms had a single point of origin
(as in the different distinctive-feature sets). However, an interesting feature of
the sixth edition has been a developed historical perspective: many of the entries
Preface to the Sixth Edition
ix

originally written for the ﬁrst edition (1980) have seriously dated over the past
25 years, and I have been struck by the number of cases where I have had to add
‘early use’, ‘in the 1970s’, and the like, to avoid giving the impression that the
terms have current relevance.
I have tried to make the entries as self-contained as possible, and not relied on
obligatory cross-references to other entries to complete the exposition of a sense.
I have preferred to work on the principle that, as most dictionary-users open
a dictionary with a single problematic term in mind, they should be given a
satisfactory account of that term as immediately as possible. I therefore explain
competence under competence, performance under performance, and so on.
As a consequence of the interdependence of these terms, however, this procedure
means that there must be some repetition: at least the salient characteristics of
the term performance must be incorporated into the entry for competence, and
vice versa. This repetition would be a weakness if the book were read from
cover to cover; but a dictionary should not be used as a textbook.
As the book has grown in size, over its various editions, it has proved
increasingly essential to identify major lexical variants as separate headwords,
rather than leaving them ‘buried’ within an entry, so that readers can ﬁnd the
location of a term quickly. One of the problems with discursive encyclopedic
treatments is that terms can get lost; and a difﬁculty in tracking terms down,
especially within my larger entries, has been a persistent criticism of the book.
I have lost count of the number of times someone has written to say that I
should include X in the next edition, when X was already there – in a place
which seemed a logical location to me, but evidently not to my correspondent.
The biggest change between the ﬁfth and earlier editions was to bite this bullet.
That edition increased the number of ‘X see Y’ entries. All ‘buried’ terminology
was extracted from within entries and introduced into the headword list.
Within an entry, the following conventions should be noted:
The main terms being deﬁned are printed in boldface. In the ﬁfth edition,
I dropped the convention (which some readers found confusing) of including
inﬂectional variants immediately after the headword; these are now included in
bold within an entry, on their ﬁrst mention.
I also increased the amount of guidance about usage, especially relevant to
readers for whom English is not a ﬁrst language, by adding word-class identiﬁers
for single-word headwords, and incorporating an illustration of usage into the
body of an entry: for example, the entry on inessive contains a sentence beginning
‘The inessive case (‘the inessive’) is found in Finnish . . .’ – a convention which
illustrates that inessive can be used adjectivally as well as nominally.
Terms deﬁned elsewhere in this dictionary are printed in small capitals
within an entry (disregarding inﬂectional endings) – but only on their ﬁrst
appearance within an entry, and only where their technical status is important
for an appreciation of the sense of the entry.

Acknowledgements
For the ﬁrst edition, prepared in 1978, I was fortunate in having several colleagues
in my department at Reading University who gave generously of their time to
read the text of this dictionary, in whole or in part, advised me on how to
proceed in relation to several of the above problems, and pointed out places
where my own biases were intruding too markedly: Ron Brasington, Paul Fletcher,
Michael Garman, Arthur Hughes, Peter Matthews, Frank Palmer and Irene
Warburton. Hilary, my wife, typed the ﬁnal version of the whole book (and
this before word-processors were around!). A second edition is in many ways
a stronger entity, as it beneﬁts from feedback from reviewers and readers,
and among those who spent time improving that edition (1984) were K. V. T.
Bhat, Colin Biggs, Georges Bourcier, René Dirven, DuRan GabrovRek, Gerald
Gazdar, Francisco Gomez de Matos, Lars Hermerén, Rodney Huddleston, Neil
Smith, John Wood and Walburga von Rafﬂer Engel. For the third edition (1990),
the need to cover syntactic theory efﬁciently required special help, which was
provided by Ewa Jaworska and Bob Borsley. During the 1990s, the arrival of
major encyclopedic projects, such as the International Encyclopedia of Linguistics
(OUP, 1992) and The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics (Pergamon,
1993) provided an invaluable indication of new terms and senses, as did the
series of Blackwell Handbooks in Linguistics. As editor of Linguistics Abstracts
at the time, my attention was drawn by the systematic coverage of that journal
to several terms which I would otherwise have missed. All these sources provided
material for the fourth edition (1996).
The ﬁfth edition beneﬁted from a review of the fourth edition written by the
late and much-missed James McCawley, as well as by material from Lisa Green,
William Idsardi, Allard Jongman, Peter Lasersohn and Ronald Wardhaugh, who
acted as consultants for sections of vocabulary relating to their specialisms. It is
no longer possible for one person to keep pace with all the developments in this
amazing subject, and without them that edition would, quite simply, not have
been effective. I am immensely grateful for their interest and commitment, as
indeed for that of the editorial in-house team at Blackwells, who arranged it.
The ﬁfth edition was also set directly from an XML ﬁle, an exercise which could
not have proceeded so efﬁciently without the help of Tony McNicholl. The sixth
edition has continued this policy of standing on the shoulders of specialists, and
I warmly acknowledge the assistance of William Idsardi and Allard Jongman

(for a second time), as well as John Field, Janet Fuller, Michael Kenstowicz,
John Saeed, and Hidezaku Tanaka.
As always, I remain responsible for the use I have made of all this help, and
continue to welcome comments from readers willing to draw my attention to
areas where further progress might be made.

A
A
An abbreviation for argument in government-binding theory. A-position
is a position in D-structure to which an argument (or theta role) can be
assigned, such as subject and object; also called an argument-position. It con-
trasts with A-bar-position (or A′′′′′-position), also called a non-argument position,
which does not allow the assignment of a theta role, such as the position occupied
by an initial wh-item (e.g. who in Who did she ask?). The distinction does not
have a clear status within the vp-internal subject hypothesis. A binding rela-
tion where the antecedent is in an A-position is said to be A-bound (otherwise,
A-free); one to an A-bar-position is A-bar-bound (otherwise, A-bar-free).
movement to these positions is handled by A-movement and A-bar-movement,
respectively. See also chain (2).
abbreviated clause
see reduce (3)
abbreviation (n.)
The everyday sense of this term has been reﬁned in lin-
guistics as part of the study of word-formation, distinguishing several ways
in which words can be shortened. Initialisms or alphabetisms reﬂect the
separate pronunciation of the initial letters of the constituent words (TV, COD);
acronyms are pronounced as single words (NATO, laser); clipped forms or
clippings are reductions of longer forms, usually removing the end of the word
(ad from advertisement), but sometimes the beginning (plane), or both begin-
ning and ending together (ﬂu); and blends combine parts of two words (sitcom,
motel).
abbreviatory (adj.)
A term, derived from abbreviation, which appears within
linguistics and phonetics as part of the phrase abbreviatory convention – any
device used in a formal analysis which allows rules that share common elements to
be combined (see bracketing (2)), thus permitting greater economy of statement.
abducted (adj.)
see vocal folds
abessive (adj./n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a type
of inﬂection which expresses the meaning of absence, such as would be
expressed in English by the preposition ‘without’. The abessive case (‘the
A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics 6th Edition.  David Crystal
© 2008 David Crystal.  ISBN: 978-1-405-15296-9

abessive’) is found in Finnish, for example, along with adessive, inessive and
several other cases expressing ‘local’ temporal and spatial meanings.
A-binding (n.)
see binding theory, bound (2)
ablative (adj./n.) (abl, ABL)
In languages which express grammatical relation-
ships by means of inﬂections, a term referring to the form taken by a noun
phrase (often a single noun or pronoun), typically used in the expression
of a range of locative or instrumental meanings. English does not have an
‘ablative case’ (‘an ablative’), as did Latin, but uses other means (the preposi-
tions with, from and by in particular) to express these notions, e.g. He did it
with his hands.
ablaut (n.)
see gradation (2)
A-bound (adj.)
see bound (2)
abrupt (adj.)
A term sometimes used in the distinctive feature theory of
phonology, as part of the phrase abrupt release: it refers to a sound released
suddenly, without the acoustic turbulence of a fricative, as in plosive con-
sonants. Its opposite is delayed release, used to characterize affricates.
absolute (adj.) (1)
A term used in traditional grammatical description,
and occasionally in linguistics, to refer to a sentence constituent which is
isolated from or abnormally connected to the rest of the sentence. English
displays an absolute use of adverbs and adjectives in sentence-initial posi-
tion, e.g. However, he arrived later; Happy, she went to sleep. In Latin, there
are such exocentric constructions as the ‘ablative absolute’, as in hoc facto
(= ‘this having been done’).
(2)
In linguistic theory, the term refers to a type of universal. An absolute
universal is one which characterizes all languages, without exception; it con-
trasts with relative universal.
(3)
See relative (3).
absolutive (adj./n.) (abs, ABS)
A term used in the grammatical description
of some languages, such as Inuktitut and Georgian, where there is an ergative
system. In this system, there is a formal parallel between the object of a
transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive one (i.e. they display the
same case), and these are referred to as ‘absolutive’: the subject of the transitive
verb is then referred to as ‘ergative’.
absorption (n.) (1)
A term used in generative grammar for a process in
which an element incorporates a syntactic feature that it does not normally
possess. An example would be a case feature on a verb, normally assigned to
an NP object, which is absorbed by a passive participle.
(2)
In phonology, an absorption process is seen especially in some tone
languages, where a sequence of tones at the same level is conﬂated. For example, a
2
A-binding

falling (high-to-low) contour tone might be followed by a low tone, yielding
a possible high–low–low sequence; one low tone would then absorb the other,
resulting in a high–low sequence. See also obligatory contour principle,
spreading (3).
abstract (adj.) (1) (abstr)
A term used in phonology to describe any analytical
approach which relies on unobservable elements, such as underlying forms;
opposed to concrete or natural. Theories vary in the amount of abstractness they
permit, and this is sometimes reﬂected in the title of an individual approach,
such as in natural generative phonology.
(2)
A traditional term used in grammar to describe nouns which lack
observable reference, such as thought, mystery and principle; opposed to
concrete, where the nouns have physical attributes, such as tree, box and
dog. The distinction is treated with caution in linguistics because of the
difﬁculty of deciding which category many nouns belong to, especially when
dealing with all aspects of perception and behaviour. Music and happiness,
for example, have been called abstract nouns, though the ﬁrst is perceptible
to the senses, and the second can be related to observable behaviour. Linguisti-
cally oriented grammars prefer to operate with such formal distinctions as
countability.
accent (n.) (1)
The cumulative auditory effect of those features of pronun-
ciation which identify where a person is from, regionally or socially. The lin-
guistics literature emphasizes that the term refers to pronunciation only, and
is thus distinct from dialect, which refers to grammar and vocabulary
as well. The investigation of the ways in which accents differ from each other
is sometimes called accent studies. Regional accents can relate to any locale,
including both rural and urban communities within a country (e.g. ‘West Country’,
‘Liverpool’) as well as national groups speaking the same language (e.g. ‘Amer-
ican’, ‘Australian’), and our impression of other languages (‘foreign accent’,
‘Slavic accent’). Social accents relate to the cultural and educational background
of the speaker. Countries with a well-deﬁned traditional social-class system,
such as India and Japan, reﬂect these divisions in language, and accent is often
a marker of class. In Britain, the best example of a social accent is the regionally
neutral accent associated with a public-school education, and with the related
professional domains, such as the Civil Service, the law courts, the Court and
the BBC – hence the labels ‘Queen’s English’, ‘BBC English’, and the like.
received pronunciation (RP) is the name given to this accent, and because of
its regional neutrality RP speakers are sometimes thought of as having ‘no
accent’. This is a misleading way of putting it, however: linguistics stresses that
everyone must have an accent, though it may not indicate regional origin. The
popular label ‘broad accent’ refers to those accents that are markedly different
from RP.
(2)
The emphasis which makes a particular word or syllable stand out in a
stream of speech – one talks especially of an accented sound/word/syllable, or
the accent(ual) pattern of a phrase/sentence. The term is usually found in a
discussion of metre (metrics), where it refers to the ‘beats’ in a line of poetry –
the accented syllables, as opposed to the unaccented ones. But any style of spoken
language could be described with reference to the relative weight (accentuation)
accent
3

of its syllables: one might talk of the ‘strongly accented’ speech of a politician,
for instance. Technically, accent is not solely a matter of loudness but also
of pitch and duration, especially pitch: comparing the verb record (as in
I’m going to record the tune) and the noun (I’ve got a record), the contrast
in word accent between record and record is made by the syllables differing
in loudness, length and pitch movement. The notion of pitch accent has also
been used in the phonological analysis of these languages, referring to cases
where there is a restricted distribution of tone within words (as in Japanese).
A similar use of these variables is found in the notion of sentence accent
(also called ‘contrastive accent’). This is an important aspect of linguistic analy-
sis, especially of intonation, because it can affect the acceptability, the
meaning, or the presuppositions of a sentence, e.g. He was wearing a red hat
could be heard as a response to Was he wearing a red coat?, whereas He was
wearing a red hat would respond to Was he wearing a green hat? The term
stress, however, is often used for contrasts of this kind (as in the phrases ‘word
stress’ and ‘contrastive stress’). An analysis in terms of pitch accent is also
possible (see pitch). The total system of accents in a language is sometimes
called the accentual system, and would be part of the study of phonology. The
coinage accentology for the study of accents is sometimes found in European
linguistics.
(3)
In graphology, an accent is a mark placed above a letter, showing how
that letter is to be pronounced. French accents, for example, include a distinction
between é, è and ê. Accents are a type of diacritic.

see accent (2)
acceptability (n.)
The extent to which linguistic data would be judged by
native-speakers to be possible in their language. An acceptable utterance is
one whose use would be considered permissible or normal. In practice, deciding
on the acceptability of an utterance may be full of difﬁculties. Native-speakers
often disagree as to whether an utterance is normal, or even possible. One
reason for this is that intuitions differ because of variations in regional and
social backgrounds, age, personal preferences, and so on. An utterance may be
normal in one dialect, but unacceptable in another, e.g. I ain’t, I be, I am.
Much also depends on the extent to which people have been brought up to
believe that certain forms of language are ‘correct’ and others are ‘wrong’:
many do not accept as desirable those sentences which the prescriptive
approach to grammar would criticize, such as I will go tomorrow (for I shall
go . . . ), or This is the man I spoke to (for . . . to whom I spoke). To a linguist,
all such utterances are acceptable, in so far as a section of the community uses
them consistently in speech or writing. The analytic problem is to determine
which sections of the community use which utterances on which occasions.
Within a dialect, an utterance may be acceptable in one context but unac-
ceptable in another.
Linguistics has devised several techniques for investigating the acceptability
of linguistic data. These usually take the form of experiments in which
native-speakers are asked to evaluate sets of utterances containing those language
features over whose acceptability there is some doubt (acceptability tests). It
is necessary to have some such agreed techniques for judging acceptability
4
accentology

as, especially in speech, very many utterances are produced whose status as
sentences is open to question. In one sample of data, someone said, I think
it’s the money they’re charging is one thing. The job of the linguist is to deter-
mine whether this was a mistake on the speaker’s part, or whether this is a
regular feature of a speech system; if the latter, then whether this feature is
idiosyncratic, or characteristic of some social group; and so on. Such inve-
stigations by their nature are inevitably large-scale, involving many inform-
ants and sentence patterns; they are therefore very time-consuming, and are
not often carried out. An utterance which is considered unacceptable is
marked by an asterisk; if marginally acceptable, usually by a question mark,
as follows:
*the wall was arrived before
?the wall was arrived before by the army sent by the king
These conventions are also used to indicate ungrammatical or marginally
grammatical sentences. In linguistic theory, though, the difference between the
acceptability and the grammaticality of a sentence is important. A sentence
may be grammatically correct, according to the rules of the grammar of a
language, but none the less unacceptable, for a variety of other reasons. For
example, owing to the repeated application of a rule, the internal structure of a
sentence may become too complex, exceeding the processing abilities of the
speaker: these performance limitations are illustrated in such cases of multiple
embedding as This is the malt that the rat that the cat killed ate, which is
much less acceptable than This is the malt that the rat ate, despite the fact that
the same grammatical operations have been used. In generative linguistic theory,
variations in acceptability are analysed in terms of performance; grammaticality,
by contrast, is a matter of competence.
acceptable (adj.)
see acceptability
access (n.)
A term derived from psychology, and used in psycholinguistics
to refer to the extent to which a speaker can retrieve a linguistic unit from
memory. Problems of access are evident in ‘tip-of-the-tongue’ and tongue-slip
phenomena, as well as in the varying times it takes someone to react to struc-
tures involving different degrees of complexity. It is especially encountered in
studies of lexical access.
accessibility hierarchy
In relational grammar, a term used to refer to
a postulated linear series of dependencies between nominal entities, which
controls the applicability of syntactic rules. In the hierarchy, each entity
in the series more freely undergoes syntactic rules than the items to the
right. For example, the nominal operating as a subject is said to be ‘more
accessible’ than that operating as direct object; the direct object is more
accessible than the indirect object; and so on. The notion has been applied
to several grammatical areas (e.g. relative clause formation, the use of
reﬂexives, and quantiﬁers), but the full application of this principle remains
to be explored.

accessible (adj.)
see accessibility hierarchy
accidence (n.)
Most traditional grammars recognize accidence as one of
their main subdivisions, along with syntax. It refers to the variations in word
structure which express grammatical meanings, such as case, tense, number
and gender. In English, for example, the difference between walk, walks, walk-
ing and walked or between boy, boys, boy’s and boys’ would be described as
part of the accidence section of a grammar. In linguistics, this term is rarely
used, as these phenomena are handled under the heading of morphology,
where they are seen as one process of word-formation alongside several
others.
accidental gap
see gap (1)
accommodate (v.)
see accommodation (1)
accommodation (n.) (1)
A theory in sociolinguistics which aims to explain
why people modify their style of speaking (accommodate) to become more like
or less like that of their addressee(s). For example, among the reasons why
people converge towards the speech pattern of their listener are the desires to
identify more closely with the listener, to win social approval, or simply to
increase the communicative efﬁciency of the interaction.
(2)
In semantics and pragmatics, a term which refers to the acceptance by a
hearer of a presupposition made by a speaker that was not previously part of
their common ground. For example, on hearing ‘All Mary’s children have got
colds’, we would accept the presupposition that Mary has children, even if we
were previously unaware of the fact. Accommodation is often modelled using
rules which copy the presupposition into the representation of the preceding
discourse.
accomplishment (n.)
A category used in the classiﬁcation of predicates in
terms of their aspectual properties (or ‘Aktionsarten’) devised by US philo-
sopher Zeno Vendler (1921–2004). Accomplishment predicates represent a type
of process event which extends in time but reaches a culmination point: build,
for example, is of this type, being both durative and telic. In this system
they contrast with two other types of process predicate (achievement and
activity) and with state predicates.
accusative (adj./n.) (acc, ACC)
In languages which express grammatical
relationships by means of inﬂections, this term refers to the form taken by a
noun phrase (often a single noun or pronoun) when it is the object of a
verb. In Latin, for example, I see the man would be Video hominem and not
*Video homo, and hominem would be referred to as being ‘in the accusative
case’. linguists emphasize that it can be misleading to use such terms as
‘accusative’ in languages which do not inﬂect words in this way. In English, for
instance, whether a word is the object of the verb or not usually depends on
word-order, as in Dog bites postman, where the recipient of the action is
plainly the postman. Some traditional grammars would say here that postman is
therefore ‘accusative’, but as there is no formal change between this word’s use
6
accessible

as object and its use as subject (Postman bites dog) linguists argue that this
is a misleading use of the term, and avoid using it in such contexts. The only
instance of a genuine accusative form of a word in English is in some pronouns,
e.g. He saw him, She saw her, The man whom I saw, and even here many
linguists would prefer to use a neutral term, such as ‘objective case’, to avoid
the connotations of traditional grammars. A distinction is often made between
accusative languages (where subjects and objects can be distinguished using
morphological or abstract cases) and ergative languages; ergative verbs are
sometimes called unaccusative verbs. In accounts which rely on an abstract
notion of case, verbs which take objects are sometimes called accusative verbs.
accusativity (n.)
see accusative
achievement (n.)
A category used in the classiﬁcation of predicates in terms of
their aspectual properties (or ‘Aktionsarten’) devised by US philosopher Zeno
Vendler (1921–2004). Achievement predicates represent a type of process event
which takes place instantaneously: arrive, for example, is of this type, being
punctual in character. In this system they contrast with two other types of
process predicate (accomplishment and activity) and with state predicates.

acoustic feature
A characteristic of a speech sound when analysed in physical
terms, e.g. fundamental frequency, amplitude, harmonic structure. Such analyses
are provided by acoustic phonetics, and it is possible to make acoustic
classiﬁcations of speech sounds based upon such features, as when one classiﬁes
vowels in terms of their formant structure. The acoustic properties of a sound
which aid its identiﬁcation in speech are known as acoustic cues. In the distinct-
ive feature theory of phonology of Jakobson and Halle (see Jakobsonian),
acoustic features are the primary means of deﬁning the binary oppositions that
constitute the phonological system of a language.
acoustic phonetics
The branch of phonetics which studies the physical pro-
perties of speech sound, as transmitted between mouth and ear, according to
the principles of acoustics (the branch of physics devoted to the study of sound).
It is wholly dependent on the use of instrumental techniques of investigation,
particularly electronics, and some grounding in physics and mathematics is a
prerequisite for advanced study of this subject. Its importance to the phonetician
is that acoustic analysis can provide a clear, objective datum for investigation of
speech – the physical ‘facts’ of utterance. In this way, acoustic evidence is often
referred to when one wants to support an analysis being made in articulatory
or auditory phonetic terms. On the other hand, it is important not to become
too reliant on acoustic analyses, which are subject to mechanical limitations
(e.g. the need to calibrate measuring devices accurately), and which are often
themselves open to multiple interpretations. Sometimes, indeed, acoustic and
auditory analyses of a sound conﬂict – for example, in intonation studies, one
may hear a speech melody as rising, whereas the acoustic facts show the
acoustic phonetics
7

fundamental frequency of the sound to be steady. In such cases, it is for
phoneticians to decide which evidence they will pay more attention to; there has
been a longstanding debate concerning the respective merits of physical (i.e.
acoustic) as opposed to psychological (i.e. auditory) solutions to such problems,
and how apparent conﬂicts of this kind can be resolved.
acquire (v.)
see acquisition
acquisition (n.) (1)
In the study of the growth of language in children, a term
referring to the process or result of learning (acquiring) a particular aspect of a
language, and ultimately the language as a whole. Child language acquisition
(or ﬁrst-language acquisition) is the label usually given to the ﬁeld of studies
involved. The subject has involved the postulation of ‘stages’ of acquisition,
deﬁned chronologically, or in relation to other aspects of behaviour, which it is
suggested apply generally to children; and there has been considerable discus-
sion of the nature of the learning strategies which are used in the process of
acquiring language, and of the criteria which can decide when a structure has
been acquired. Some theorists have made a distinction between ‘acquisition’ and
development, the former referring to the learning of a linguistic rule (of gram-
mar, phonology, semantics), the latter to the further use of this rule in an
increasingly wide range of linguistic and social situations. Others see no clear
distinction between these two facets of language learning, and use the terms
interchangeably. The term child language development has also come to be used
for discourse-based studies of child language.
In early generative linguistics, the term language acquisition device (LAD)
was introduced to refer to a model of language learning in which the infant is
credited with an innate predisposition to acquire linguistic structure. This view
is usually opposed to those where language acquisition is seen as a process of
imitation-learning or as a reﬂex of cognitive development. See also behaviour-
ism, emergentism, innateness.
(2)
Acquisition is also used in the context of learning a foreign language:
‘foreign-’ or ‘second-language’ acquisition is thus distinguished from ‘ﬁrst-
language’ or ‘mother-tongue’ acquisition. In this context, acquisition is some-
times opposed to learning: the former is viewed as an environmentally natural
process, the primary force behind foreign-language ﬂuency; the latter is seen as
an instructional process which takes place in a teaching context, guiding the
performance of the speaker.
acrolect (n.)
A term used by some sociolinguists, in the study of the devel-
opment of creole languages, to refer to a prestige or standard variety (or
lect) to which it is possible to compare other lects. An acrolectal variety is
contrasted with a mesolect and a basilect.
acronym (n.)
see abbreviation
across-the-board (ATB)
A term used in various branches of linguistics for an
effect which applies to the whole of a designated linguistic system or subsystem.
In particular, in language acquisition it represents a view of phonological
8
acquire

development which asserts that, when children introduce a new pronunciation,
the new form spreads to all the words in which it would be found in adult
speech – for example, if /l/ and /j/ are at ﬁrst both pronounced [j], and [l] is later
acquired, it will be used only in adult words which contain /l/, and not /j/. There
is no implication that the change takes place instantaneously. In generative
grammar, the term has also been used to refer to phenomena which affect all the
constituents in a co-ordinate structure; for example, a wh-phrase moves across-
the-board in What did Mary make and sell? See also diffusion.
actant (n.)
In valency grammar, a functional unit determined by the
valency of the verb; opposed to circonstant. Examples would include subject
and direct object.
action (n.)
see actor–action–goal
active (adj./n.) (1) (act, ACT)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of
voice, referring to a sentence, clause, or verb form where, from a semantic
point of view, the grammatical subject is typically the actor, in relation to the
verb, e.g. The boy wrote a letter. ‘Active voice’ (or ‘the active’) is contrasted
with passive, and sometimes with other forms of the verb, e.g. the ‘middle
voice’ in Greek.
(2)
See articulation (1).
active knowledge
A term used, especially in relation to language learning, for
the knowledge of language which a user actively employs in speaking or writing;
it contrasts with passive knowledge, which is what a person understands in the
speech or writing of others. Native speakers’ passive knowledge of vocabulary
(passive vocabulary), for example, is much greater than their active knowledge
(active vocabulary): people know far more words than they use.
activity (n.)
A category used in the classiﬁcation of predicates in terms of
their aspectual properties (or ‘Aktionsarten’) devised by US philosopher Zeno
Vendler (1921–2004). Activity predicates represent a type of process event
which need not reach a culmination point: walk, for example, is of this type,
being dynamic and atelic in character. In this system they contrast with two
other types of process predicate (accomplishment and achievement) and
with state predicates.
actor–action–goal
A phrase used in the grammatical and semantic analysis
of sentence patterns, to characterize the typical sequence of functions within
statements in many languages. In the sentence John saw a duck, for example,
John is the actor, saw the action, and a duck the goal. On the other hand,
languages display several other ‘favourite’ sequences, such as Welsh, where the
unmarked sequence is action–actor–goal. The phrase is widely used, but
not without criticism, as the semantic implications of terms such as ‘actor’
do not always coincide with the grammatical facts, e.g. in The stone moved,
the subject of the sentence is hardly an ‘actor’ in the same sense as John is
above.
actor–action–goal

actualization (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the physical
expression of an abstract linguistic unit; e.g. phonemes are actualized in
phonic substance as phones, morphemes as morphs. Any underlying form
may be seen as having a corresponding actualization in substance. realization
is a more widely used term. See also exponence.
acute (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle (see
Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to handle
variations in place of articulation; its opposite is grave. Acute sounds are
deﬁned articulatorily and acoustically as those involving a medial articula-
tion in the vocal tract, and a concentration of acoustic energy in the higher
frequencies; examples of [+acute] sounds are front vowels, and dental,
alveolar and palatal consonants.
additive bilingualism
see bilingual
address (n.)
The general use of this term, in the sense of ‘the manner of referring
to someone in direct linguistic interaction’, has provided sociolinguistics with
a major ﬁeld of study. Forms of address (or terms of address) have been analysed
between different types of participant in different social situations, and rules
proposed to explain the speaker’s choice of terms, e.g. governing the use of ﬁrst
names, titles, intimate pronouns, etc. Social psychological concepts, such as power
and solidarity, have been suggested as particularly signiﬁcant factors in under-
standing address systems, i.e. the system of rules used by a speaker or group,
governing their use of such forms as tu and vous (T forms and V forms).
addressee (n.)
A term used in linguistics, especially in pragmatics, to refer
to one of the primary participant roles, along with speaker, in a linguistic
interaction. The notion is also relevant in sociolinguistics, where the language
of addressees is central to the notion of accommodation, and in grammar,
where taking account of an addressee may inﬂuence the choice of pronoun
(see inclusive) or motivate a particular honoriﬁc form.
adducted (adj.)
see vocal folds
adequacy (n.)
A term used in linguistic theory as part of the evaluation of
levels of success in the writing of grammars. Several sets of distinctions based
on this notion have been made. External adequacy judges a grammar in terms of
how well it corresponds to the data (which are ‘external’ to the grammar);
internal adequacy is a judgement based on the ‘internal’ characteristics of the
grammar, such as its simplicity, elegance, etc. From a different point of view,
grammars are said to be weakly adequate if they generate some desired set of
sentences; they are strongly adequate if they not only do this but also assign to
each sentence the correct structural description. An alternative formulation
recognizes three levels of achievement in grammars: observational adequacy is
achieved when a grammar generates all of a particular sample (corpus) of data,
correctly predicting which sentences are well formed; descriptive adequacy
is achieved when a grammar goes beyond this, and describes the intuitions
(competence) of the language’s speakers; explanatory adequacy is achieved
10
actualization

when a principled basis is established for deciding between alternative grammars,
all of which are descriptively adequate. More speciﬁcally, an explanatorily
adequate grammar will explain why language acquisition in a relatively short
period of time is possible on the basis of primary linguistic data.
adequate (adj.)
see adequacy
adessive (adj./n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a
type of inﬂection which expresses the meaning of presence ‘at’ or ‘near’ a
place. The ‘adessive case’ (‘the adessive’) is found in Finnish, for example, along
with allative, elative and several other cases expressing ‘local’ temporal and
spatial meanings.
adicity (n.)
see valency
adjacency (n.)
see adjacent
adjacency condition
A condition on the assignment of case in government-
binding theory which blocks Case-assignment to those noun phrases not
adjacent to the Case-assigner. Since the Case ﬁlter requires every overt NP to be
Case-marked, the adjacency condition forces NP complements to appear closer
to their Case-assigner, and thus to precede non-NP complements, as in English
John put a book on the shelf but not *John put on the shelf a book.
adjacency pair
A term used in sociolinguistic analyses of conversational inter-
action to refer to a single stimulus-plus-response sequence by the participants.
Adjacency pairs have been analysed in terms of their role in initiating, maintaining
and closing conversations (e.g. the various conventions of greeting, leave-taking,
topic-changing), and constitute, it has been suggested, an important methodo-
logical concept in investigating the ethnography of communication.
adjacent (adj.)
An application of the general sense of this term in several areas
of linguistics, especially in generative models of language, where it refers
speciﬁcally to neighbouring elements in a representation. For example, some
phonological models require a ‘locality condition’: phonological rules apply
only between elements which are next to each other on a given tier. In feature
geometry, for instance, the neighbouring representation of features or nodes
on a tier are said to be adjacent, and those separated by other elements to be
non-adjacent. In this context, the notion of adjacency is sometimes extended to
include features on different tiers, which count as adjacent if they are linked to
adjacent root nodes. In metrical phonology, the ‘metrical locality principle’
requires that rules refer only to elements at the same or adjacent layers of metrical
structure. See also adjacency pair, adjacency condition, locality (2).
adjectival (adj./n.)
see adjective
adjective (n.) (A, adj, ADJ)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of
words to refer to the main set of items which specify the attributes of nouns.
From a formal point of view, four criteria are generally invoked to deﬁne the
adjective
11

class in English (and similar kinds of criteria establish the class in other
languages): they can occur within the noun phrase, i.e. they function in the
attributive position, e.g. the big man; they can occur in a post-verbal or pre-
dicative position, e.g. the man is big; he called it stupid; they can be premodiﬁed
by an intensiﬁer, such as very, e.g. the very big man; and they can be used in
a comparative and a superlative form, either by inﬂection (e.g. big, bigger,
biggest) or periphrastically (e.g. interesting, more interesting, most interesting).
However, not all adjectives satisfy all these criteria (e.g. major, as in a major
question, does not occur predicatively – cf. *The question is major), and
the subclassiﬁcation of adjectives has proved quite complex. Both narrow and
broad applications of the term ‘adjective’ will be found in grammars. In its
broadest sense it could include everything between the determiner and the
noun, in such a phrase as the vicar’s ﬁne old English garden chair; but many
linguists prefer to restrict it to the items which satisfy most or all of the above
criteria (to include only ﬁne and old, in this example), the other items being
called ‘adjective-like’ or adjectivals. Adjectives may also be the heads of phrases
(adjective or adjectival phrases (abbreviated AP or AdjP), such as that’s very
important), and an adjectival function is sometimes recognized for certain types
of clause (e.g. he’s the man I saw). See attributive, predicative.
adjoin (v.)
see adjunction
adjunct (n.)
A term used in grammatical theory to refer to an optional or
secondary element in a construction: an adjunct may be removed without the
structural identity of the rest of the construction being affected. The clearest
examples at sentence level are adverbials, e.g. John kicked the ball yesterday
instead of John kicked the ball, but not *John kicked yesterday, etc.; but other
elements have been classed as adjunctival, in various descriptions, such as
vocatives and adjectives. Many adjuncts can also be analysed as modiﬁers,
attached to the head of a phrase (as with adjectives, and some adverbs).
The term may be given a highly restricted sense, as when it is used in Quirk
grammar to refer to a subclass of adverbials. In X-bar syntax, an adjunct is
one of the major components of a phrasal category (the others being head,
complement and speciﬁer).
adjunction (n.)
A basic syntactic operation in transformational grammar
(TG) referring to a rule which places certain elements of structure in adjacent
positions, with the aim of specifying how these structures ﬁt together in larger
units. In classical TG, several types of adjunction were recognized. In sister-
adjunction two elements were formally adjoined under a particular node and
thus became sister constituents of that node. For example, in one formulation
of the verb phrase, the negative particle was ‘sister-adjoined’ to the elements
modal and tense, as in (a) below. (A different, but related, formal operation
was known as daughter-adjunction.) Chomsky-adjunction provided an altern-
ative way of handling this situation, and is now the only type of adjunction
recognized in government-binding theory. This suggestion involves adjoin-
ing an element to a node: a copy of this node is then made immediately above
it, as in (b) below. Each of the nodes in Chomskyan adjunction structure is
12
adjoin

called a ‘segment’, and the two together are called a ‘category’. In (b), each of
the Modals is a segment, and the category Modal is a combination of the two.
A category can, but a segment cannot, dominate. This ensures that whatever
happens to modal will also happens to not – for instance, contracted not (n’t)
needs to stay with the modal if the latter is moved, as in won’t he, can’t he,
etc. It is thus claimed that this operation allows linguistically signiﬁcant
generalizations to be made which might otherwise be missed, or which would
be handled less economically. In government-binding theory, movement rules
involve either (Chomsky-) adjunction or substitution. See also stray.
adstratum
13
adjunctival (adj./n.)
see adjunct
adnominal (adj./n.)
A term used by some grammarians to refer to the elements
in a noun phrase which modify a noun (an analogy with adverbial), such as
adjectives, prepositional phrases and ‘possessive’ nouns, e.g. the big hat, the
hat in the box, the vicar’s hat. A description in terms of ‘adnominal’ elements
may also be used in the classiﬁcation of relative clauses (e.g. the car which
she bought . . .).
adposition (n.)
A term sometimes used in grammar to subsume the two cat-
egories of preposition and postposition. It proves useful when there is a need
to emphasize the adjacency of these categories to the noun, without having to
choose whether the category precedes or follows.
adstratal (adj.)
see adstratum
adstratum (n.)
A term sometimes used in sociolinguistics, referring to fea-
tures in a language which have resulted from contact with a neighbouring
language. The process of convergence may lead to the development of a

linguistic area. Adstratal features contrast with those found in the substratum
and superstratum, where a single language has been inﬂuenced by some other,
thus further differentiating it from neighbouring languages.
adultocentric (adj.)
see adultomorphic
adultomorphic (adj.)
A label sometimes used in language acquisition studies,
especially in the 1970s, to characterize an analysis of children’s speech in terms
which were originally devised for the study of the adult language; also called
adultomorphic. Examples include referring to allgone as an elliptical sen-
tence, or describing babbling using the international phonetic alphabet. It
is, of course, difﬁcult to devise a terminology or notation for child speech
which is largely or totally free of adult values, but, it is argued, caution is none
the less needed to avoid introducing too many adult assumptions, and as a
consequence attributing to children a knowledge of language which they do
not possess.
advanced tongue root
see root (2)
advancement (n.)
A term used in relational grammar for a class of relation-
changing processes. A noun phrase which bears a particular grammatical
relation to some verb comes to bear another grammatical relation to that verb,
higher up the relational hierarchy, e.g. a process converting an object to a
subject. See also promotion (1).
adverb (n.) (A, adv, ADV)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of
words to refer to a heterogeneous group of items whose most frequent function
is to specify the mode of action of the verb. In English, many (by no means all)
adverbs are signalled by the use of the -ly ending, e.g. quickly, but cf. soon.
syntactically, one can relate adverbs to such questions as how, where, when
and why, and classify them accordingly, as adverbs of ‘manner’, ‘place’, ‘time’,
etc.; but as soon as this is done the functional equivalence of adverbs, adverb
phrases, prepositional phrases, noun phrases, and adverb clauses becomes
apparent, e.g. A: When is she going? B: Now/Very soon/In ﬁve minutes/Next
week/When the bell rings. An ‘adverb phrase’ (often abbreviated as AdvP) is a
phrase with an adverb as its head, e.g. very slowly, quite soon. The term
adverbial is widely used as a general term which subsumes all ﬁve categories.
‘Adverb’ is thus a word-class (along with noun, adjective, etc.), whereas
‘adverbial’ is an element of clause structure (along with subject, object,
etc.), and the two usages need to be kept clearly distinct. Within adverbials,
many syntactic roles have been identiﬁed, of which verb modiﬁcation
has traditionally been seen as central. A function of adverbials as sentence
modiﬁers or sentence connectors has been emphasized in linguistic studies,
e.g. However/Moreover/Actually/Frankly . . . I think she was right. Several other
classes of items, very different in distribution and function, have also been
brought under the heading of ‘adverb(ial)’, such as intensiﬁers (e.g. very,
awfully) and negative particles (e.g. not); but often linguistic studies set these
up as distinct word-classes. See also manner adverb(ial), quantiﬁer, rel-
ative (1).

adversative (adj./n.)
In grammar and semantics, a form or construction which
expresses an antithetical circumstance. Adversative meaning can be expressed
in several grammatical ways (as ‘adversatives’), such as through a conjunction
(but), adverbial (however, nevertheless, yet, in spite of that, on the other hand),
or preposition (despite, except, apart from, notwithstanding).
aerometry (n.)
In phonetics, the measurement of airﬂow during speech; also
called electroaerometry. Several instruments, such as the electroaerometer, have
been designed to provide such data, using a special face mask which allows
separate measures of airﬂow to be made from mouth and nose.
affect (n.)
A term sometimes used in semantics as part of a classiﬁcation of
types of meaning: it refers to the attitudinal element in meaning, as in the
differing emotional associations (or connotations) of lexical items (e.g. a
youth/youngster stood on the corner) or the expression of attitude (or affect)
in intonation. Affective meaning is usually opposed to cognitive meaning.
Alternative terms include emotive and attitudinal.
affect alpha
A maximally general notion introduced into government-
binding theory, subsuming the three operations of ‘move alpha’ (or ‘alpha
movement’), ‘insert alpha’ (or ‘alpha insertion’) and ‘delete alpha’ (or ‘alpha
deletion’). It could be glossed as ‘do anything to any category’. See alpha
notation, move alpha.
affected (adj.)
A term used by some linguists as part of the grammatical
or semantic analysis of a sentence in terms of cases or participant roles:
it usually refers to an entity (animate or inanimate) which does not cause
the happening denoted by the verb, but is directly involved in some other way.
It is typically the role of the direct object, e.g. I kicked the ball. patient,
objective and goal have sometimes been used in this sense, but alternative
interpretations for these terms are common.
affective (adj.)
see affect
afﬁrmative (adj./n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a type
of sentence or verb which has no marker of negation, i.e. it is expressing an
assertion. The ‘afﬁrmative’, or positive, ‘pole’ of this contrast is opposed to
‘negative’, and the grammatical system involved is often referred to under the
heading of polarity.
afﬁx (n.) (AFF) (1)
The collective term for the types of formative that can
be used only when added to another morpheme (the root or stem), i.e. afﬁxes
afﬁx
15

are a type of ‘bound’ morpheme. Afﬁxes are limited in number in a language,
and are generally classiﬁed into three types, depending on their position with
reference to the root or stem of the word: those which are added to the
beginning of a root/stem (preﬁxes), e.g. unhappy; those which follow (suf-
ﬁxes), e.g. happiness; and those which occur within a root/stem (inﬁxes). Less
common terms include circumﬁx or ambiﬁx, for a combination of preﬁx and
sufﬁx (as in en-light-en). The morphological process whereby grammatical or
lexical information is added to a stem is known as afﬁxation (‘preﬁxation’,
‘sufﬁxation’, ‘inﬁxation’). From an alternative point of view, afﬁxes may be
divided into inﬂectional and derivational types.
The number of afﬁxes in a word has been suggested as one of the criteria for
classifying languages into types (the afﬁx(ing) index). Languages which express
grammatical relationships primarily through the use of afﬁxes are known as
afﬁxing languages, e.g. a ‘preﬁxing’ language (as in Bantu), or a ‘sufﬁxing’
language (as in Latin or Greek).
In generative grammar, the term ‘afﬁx’ applies to such notions as ‘present’ and
‘past’, as well as -ing, be, have, etc., in the formulation of rules. Afﬁx hopping,
in this approach, is an obligatory transformational rule which attaches an
afﬁx to the appropriate formative in a string: the afﬁx ‘hops’ over the verb,
which is adjacent to it, e.g. -ing+go becoming go+-ing.
(2)
In the demisyllabic analysis of syllables, the afﬁx is an optional
element attached to the syllabic core. Two types of afﬁx are recognized:
preﬁx (p-ﬁx) and sufﬁx (s-ﬁx), the abbreviated forms being preferred in order to
avoid terminological confusion with the corresponding notions in morpho-
logy. The point of division between core and afﬁx is shown notationally by
a dot.
afﬁxal morphology
An approach to morphology which claims that the
only permissible morphological operation is the combining of afﬁxes and
stems (other alternations, such as gradation or deletion, are part of the
phonology). This restriction is absent in non-afﬁxal morphology.
afﬁxation (n.), afﬁx-hopping (n.), afﬁxing (adj.)
see afﬁx
affricate (n.)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on the
basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to a sound made when the
air-pressure behind a complete closure in the vocal tract is gradually
released; the initial release produces a plosive, but the separation which
follows is sufﬁciently slow to produce audible friction, and there is thus a
fricative element in the sound also. However, the duration of the friction
is usually not as long as would be the case of an independent fricative sound.
If it is very brief indeed, the term affrication is used; in some English dialects,
such as Cockney, affricated plosives may be heard, such as [ts] and [dz], the
auditory brevity of the friction element being indicated in the transcription by
the small symbols. It is, then, the combination of plosion and friction which
identiﬁes an affricate. In English, only [t] and [d] are released in this way, as in
ch-[Ä] of chip and j-[u] of just. German examples are [pf-] pfennig, ‘penny’ and
[ts] zu, ‘to’.
16
afﬁxal morphology

While affricates are phonetically easy to deﬁne, it is often a problem for
phonological analysis to decide whether a sequence of plosive and fricative
elements constitutes a single functional unit, or is best analysed as two separate
units. English [Ä], for example, occurs initially, medially and ﬁnally in a word,
readily contrasting with other phonemes, e.g. chip/sip, richer/ripper, patch/pat.
On the other hand [tr], while occurring initially and medially (trip/sip, petrol/
petal), does not occur ﬁnally. Further, [tθ] only occurs ﬁnally (eighth/eight).
Phonetically, all could be considered affricates; but, phonologically, there would
be difference of opinion as to whether those with a restricted distribution
could usefully be identiﬁed in this way.

agent (n.)
see agentive
agentive (adj./n.) (AGT)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to
a form or construction whose typical function in a sentence is to specify
the means whereby a particular action came about (the agent). In some languages,
the term is used as one of the cases for nouns, along with accusative, etc. In
English, the term has especial relevance with reference to the passive construc-
tion, where the agent may be expressed or unexpressed (agentless) (e.g. the man
was bitten [by a snake]). In active constructions in English, the agent is usually
the grammatical subject, but in some sentences (and often in some other lan-
guages) a more complex statement of agentive function is required (as in such
sentences as The window broke (see ergative) and We ran the car out of
petrol). ‘Agentive’ (later, ‘agent’) has a special status in several linguistic theories,
such as case grammar and government-binding theory, where it is deﬁned
similarly to the above, but is seen as one of a ﬁxed set of semantic cases or roles
(theta roles), along with objective, dative, etc. The term counter-agent
is also used in the context of case grammar. See semantic role.

agglutinative (adj.)
A term which characterizes a type of language established
by comparative linguistics using structural (as opposed to diachronic)
criteria, and focusing on the characteristics of the word: in agglutinative or
agglutinating languages, words typically contain a linear sequence of morphs –
as seen in English dis/establish/ment – and thus contrast with isolating and
inﬂectional languages. As always in such classiﬁcations, the categories are
not clear-cut: different languages will display the characteristic of agglutination
to a greater or lesser degree. Languages which display agglutination to a major
extent include Turkish and Japanese.

agrammatism (n.)
A term traditionally used in language pathology, as part
of the study of aphasia, referring to a type of speech production characterized
by telegraphic syntactic structures, the loss of function words and in-
ﬂections, and a generally reduced grammatical range; also called agrammatic
speech and noted especially in Broca’s (expressive) aphasia. There may also be
problems of comprehension. The notion has come to attract research interest
in neurolinguistics and psycholinguistics as part of the study of the way
the brain processes language. A distinction was traditionally drawn between
agrammatism (the omission of items) and paragrammatism (the deviant replace-
ment of items), but as both types of symptoms are often found in the same
patient, in varying degrees, the dichotomy is now felt to obscure rather than
clarify the nature of the phenomenon. The terms are much more likely to be
encountered in language pathology than in psycholinguistics.
agree (v.)
see agreement
agreement (n.)
A traditional term used in grammatical theory and description
to refer to a formal relationship between elements, whereby a form of one
word requires a corresponding form of another (i.e. the forms agree). In Latin,
for example, agreement between elements is of central importance, being one of
the main means of expressing grammatical relationships, in the absence of ﬁxed
patterns of word-order. The term concord has been more widely used in
linguistic studies, but in generative linguistics ‘agreement’ resurfaced with a
new range of application. In government-binding theory, agreement mark-
ing (AGR) of person, gender or number in ﬁnite verbs plays an important role
in binding theory and case theory. In generalized phrase-structure gram-
mar, the control agreement principle (CAP) is a semantically based principle
governing the distribution of agreement marking. In the minimalist programme,
agree allows the checking of features without movement – for example, checking
the Case feature on an object DP without moving the object. The checking
feature (probe) must c-command the checked feature (goal).
airstream mechanism
A term used in phonetics for a physiological process
which provides a source of energy capable of being used in speech sound
production. Air is moved inwards or outwards by the movement of this mech-
anism, producing respectively an ingressive and an egressive airﬂow. The main
initiator of air movement is the lungs (the pulmonic airstream), which underlies
the majority of human speech sounds. The ‘glottalic’ airstream mechanism, as
its name suggests, uses the movement of the glottis (the aperture between the
vocal folds) as the source of energy (see glottal). The ‘velaric’ airstream
mechanism, also as its name suggests, involves an airﬂow produced by a move-
ment of the back of the tongue against the velum (see velar). It is also
possible to start air vibrating using other movable parts of the vocal tract, such
as the cheeks or the oesophagus, but these are not methods used in normal
speech production. The use of the cheeks produces a ‘buccal’ voice (the basis for
18
AGR

the Donald Duck effect); the ‘oesophageal’ voice is characteristic of the speech
taught to people who have had their larynx surgically removed.
Aktionsart /akt}cvänswpt/ (n.), plural Aktionsarten
see aspect
alethic /vclipθ}k/ (adj.)
A term derived from modal logic and used by some
linguists as part of a theoretical framework for the analysis of modal verbs
and related structures in language. Alethic modality is concerned with the
necessary or contingent truth of propositions, e.g. the use of the modal in the
sentence A triangle must have three sides, i.e. ‘It is impossible for a triangle not
to have three sides.’ It contrasts with epistemic and deontic modality, which
are concerned with obligation and knowledge, respectively.
algorithm (n.)
An application in linguistics and phonetics of the general
use of this term in cybernetics, computing, etc., referring to a procedure which
applies mechanically in a ﬁnite number of precisely speciﬁed steps. Complex
operations may frequently be characterized as algorithms by breaking them
down into a sequence of simpler operations, as in the ﬂow chart of a computer
program. The main use of algorithmic reasoning in linguistics is found in the
analytic statements of a generative grammar.
alienability (n.)
see alienable
alienable (adj.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to a type of
possessive relationship formally marked in some languages (e.g. Chinese). If a
possessed item is seen as having only a temporary or non-essential dependence
on a possessor, it is said to be ‘alienable’, whereas if its relationship to the pos-
sessor is a permanent or necessary one, it is inalienable. Distinctions of alienable
possession (or alienability) are not morphologically marked in English,
but semantically the contrast can be seen in the boy’s book (alienable) and the
boy’s leg (inalienable).
ALIGN
see alignment
alignment (n.) (ALIGN)
A family of constraints in optimality theory
requiring that the domain of a feature extends to the edge of a constituent
– either the right edge, or the left edge, or both. Alignment would be used to
handle such cases as a language where a feature of nasality appears only at the
left edge of a stem or root, or the right edge of a particular tone coincides
with the right edge of a syllable. Generalized alignment is a schema for
constraints which aligns (or anchors) elements in two strings. In relation to
morphology, for example, it handles the order of morphemes, requiring that
the edge of one constituent coincides with the edge of another, such as the right
edge of a reduplicant with the left edge of a base (i.e. thereby ensuring that
the reduplicant comes before the base).
allative (adj./n.) (all, ALL)
A term used in grammatical description to refer
to a type of inﬂection which expresses the meaning of motion ‘to’ or ‘towards’
a place. The ‘allative case’ (‘the allative’) is found in Finnish, for example, along
allative
19

with illative, adessive and several other cases expressing ‘local’ temporal and
spatial meanings.
allegro (adj.)
see lento
allo-
A preﬁx used generally in linguistics to refer to any noticeable vari-
ation in the form of a linguistic unit which does not affect that unit’s func-
tional identity in the language. The formal variation noted is not linguistically
distinctive, i.e. no change of meaning is involved. The written language,
for example, consists of a series of letters, or graphemes, but each of these
graphemes can be written in several different ways, depending on such matters
as linguistic context, choice of type, handwriting variation, and so on, e.g.
‘a letter A’ may appear as A, a, a, a, etc. Each of these possibilities is a graphic
variant of the abstract grapheme (A): they are all allographs of the gra-
pheme (A). The identity of the word cat stays the same, regardless of whether
it is written cat, cAt, cat, etc. (though not all of these would be equally
acceptable).
The ﬁrst relationship of this kind to be established was in phonology, viz.
the relationship of allophones to phonemes. The phonemes of a language are
abstractions, and the particular phonetic shape they take depends on many
factors, especially their position in relation to other sounds in an utterance (see
complementary distribution). The English phoneme /t/ for example, is usually
articulated in alveolar position (as in eight), but it may occur in dental
position, as in eighth, where it has been inﬂuenced by the place of articulation of
the th sound following. We would thus talk of the alveolar and dental allophones
of /t/ in this example. Many allophones are always in principle possible for any
phoneme, given the wide range of idiosyncratic pronunciations which exist in a
speech community (see free variation). Textbooks provide information about
the major variants, viz. those clearly conditioned by linguistic or social (e.g.
accent) contexts. From a terminological point of view, one may also refer to the
above phenomenon as an allophonic variant of a phoneme (sometimes simply
a ‘phonetic variant’ or a ‘sub-phonemic variant’). The relationship between
allophones and phonemes is one of realization (or exponence): a phoneme
is ‘realized’ by its allophones. The differences between allophones can also be
stated using phonological rules or (as in optimality theory) through the
interaction of constraints. In the latter context, allophony is the term used for
cases where a feature does not occur in an inventory, but a context-speciﬁc con-
dition overrides the general prohibition.
Later, the notion of variant units in grammar was established, on analogy
with the allophone/phoneme distinction. Many of the morphemes of the lan-
guage appear in different forms, depending on the context in which they appear.
The morpheme which expresses plurality in English, for instance, appears in
several variants: cap–caps, log–logs, force–forces, mouse–mice, sheep–sheep,
etc. Each of these variant forms – the voiceless [s] of caps, the voiced [z] of logs,
the irregular shape of mice, and so on – would be said to be an allomorph of
the plural morpheme, and the phenomenon is called allomorphy. They have
also been referred to as morpheme (or morphemic) alternants or allomorphic
variants.

allegro

These are the main allo- terms which have been introduced, all opposed to an
-emic term, and the suggestion has been made that this relationship, of allo- to
-eme, is an important explanatory principle in linguistic analysis. Certainly many
other such allo- relationships have been postulated since the terminology was ﬁrst
introduced in the 1930s. Some are allochrone (non-distinctive variant of a minimal
unit of length, or chroneme), allokine (non-distinctive variant of a kineme, i.e.
a minimal unit of body movement, such as a gesture or facial expression) and
alloseme (non-distinctive variant of a minimal unit of meaning, or sememe).
None has proved to be as useful as allophone or allomorph, however, and the
extent to which this terminology is helpful when applied to such other areas of
linguistic analysis – and to behavioural analysis generally, as in the classiﬁcation
of units of dance, song, taste, movement – is disputed. See -emic/-etic.

allonym (n.)
A term used in onomastics for a name assumed by an author
which belongs to someone else. It is not a common practice, because of legal
sanctions. The reasons for adopting a false name range from literary playfulness
to outright deception. See also pseudonym.

alpha notation
A transcriptional convention in generative linguistics
which makes it possible to simplify the statement of a rule by introducing a
variable. In generative phonology, for example, it is used in cases where there
is a mutual predictability between sets of features, and avoids the necessity of
having to make separate statements for the conditions of occurrence of each
feature. For example, in order to state that a voiced plosive in a language is
always rounded whereas a voiceless plosive is always unrounded, one can
conﬂate the two rules by using the variable α to stand for the two possible
correlations [+voice] ~ [+round] and [−voice] ~ [−round], viz. [α voice] → [α
round]. Several developments of this convention will be encountered in this
approach to phonology, including the use of other variables. See also affect
alpha, move alpha.
alternant (n.)
see alternation
alternate (v.), alternating (adj.)
see metrical grid
alternation (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the relationship which
exists between the alternative forms, or variants, of a linguistic unit. The
alternation
21

usual symbol for alternation is ~. In phonology, for example, the related
vowel qualities of such words as telegraph ~ telegraphic, receive ~ reception
are sometimes described as alternants, as are the various allophones of a
phoneme. The term has had particular currency in morphology, however,
where ‘morphemic/morpheme alternant’ is another term for allomorph, and
where various subtypes have been distinguished. For example, ‘phonologically
conditioned alternants’ are illustrated in the various forms of the plural mor-
pheme (/-s/, /-z/, /-iz/), which are predictable from the preceding phonological
context (‘morphophonemic alternants’). ‘Grammatically conditioned alternants’
are cases where there is no such rationale, the occurrence of an alternant depend-
ing entirely on the particular morphemes which occur in its environment, as
in the various forms of the past participle in English (frozen, jumped, etc.).
suppletion is another category of alternation, referring to a morpheme lacking
any regular phonological correspondence with other forms in a paradigm, as in
go ~ went. In syntax, examples of sets of alternants can be seen in the various
grammatical categories, such as tense (e.g. present ~ past ~ future).
alternative set
A term used in relation to the semantics of focus for the set
of items with which the denotation of a focused constituent contrasts. For
example, in the sentence It was Mary who arrived late, the alternative set for
Mary would include individuals other than Mary whom one might have
expected would arrive late, but did not.
alveolar (adj.)
A term in the classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on the basis
of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made by the blade of the
tongue (or the tip and blade together) in contact against the alveolar ridge (or
alveolum), which is the bony prominence immediately behind the upper teeth. A
number of sounds are given an alveolar articulation in English – [t], [d], [l], [n],
[s] and [z]. If the sound is articulated towards the back of the alveolar ridge,
near where the palate begins, the term post-alveolar can be used. In English the
r in red, trip, drill is articulated in post-alveolar position.
alveopalatal, alveo-palatal (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of
speech sounds on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound
made by the front of the tongue a little in advance of the palatal articu-
latory area, i.e. in the direction of alveolar articulations; also called alveolo-
palatal. Only two such sounds are distinguished in the international phonetic
alphabet, the fricatives [≤] and [∆], which occur for example in Polish.
ambiﬁx (n.)
see afﬁx
ambiguity (n.)
The general sense of this term, referring to a word or sentence
which expresses more than one meaning (is ambiguous), is found in linguis-
tics, but several types of ambiguity are recognized. The most widely discussed
type is grammatical (or structural) ambiguity. In phrase-structure ambiguity,
alternative constituent structures can be assigned to a construction, as
in new houses and shops, which could be analysed either as new [houses and
shops] (i.e. both are new) or [new houses] and shops (i.e. only the houses
are new). In transformational ambiguity, the sentence may have a similar
22
alternative set

bracketing on the surface for both readings, but is related to more than one
structure at a more abstract level of representation. For example, Visiting
speakers can be awful is relatable to either It is awful to visit speakers or
Speakers who visit are awful. A sentence with more than two structural inter-
pretations is said to be multiply ambiguous. An analysis which demonstrates the
ambiguity in a sentence is said to disambiguate the sentence. Ambiguity which
does not arise from the grammatical analysis of a sentence, but is due solely to
the alternative meanings of an individual lexical item, is referred to as lexical
ambiguity, e.g. I found the table fascinating (= ‘object of furniture’ or ‘table of
ﬁgures’ – see polysemy). How the brain resolves ambiguities is an important
goal of psycholinguistic research.
One of the issues in semantic discussion has been to circumscribe the notion
of ambiguity so that it is not used in too broad a way. The term needs to be
distinguished, in particular, from ‘generality’ of meaning. The word parent, for
example, has one reading synonymous with mother and a second reading
synonymous with father, but this is not a case of ambiguity because parent has
a single, more general meaning which subsumes the two possibilities. Ambiguity
also needs to be distinguished from the kind of indeterminacy which sur-
rounds any sentence: in Mary saw a balloon, it is not clear when she saw it, how
big the balloon was, what its colour was, and so on. No sentence would be
called ambiguous on account of such unstated issues. Generality and indeter-
minacy of meaning are sometimes referred to as vagueness. However, many
semanticists prefer to reserve this term for expressions whose meaning involves
reference to a category whose boundaries are fuzzy.
ambiguous (adj.)
see ambiguity
ambilingualism (n.)
A term sometimes used in language learning and socio-
linguistics for the ability to speak two languages with equal facility. The
notion is usually included within the more general concept of bilingualism
(see bilingual).
ambisyllabicity (n.)
A structural analysis allowed in some models of non-
linear phonology (notably, metrical phonology) which allows intervocalic
consonants to be members of both adjacent syllables (i.e. they are ambi-
syllabic), in the underlying syllabiﬁcation of a language, while conforming
to the language’s syllable structure template.
ameliorate (v.)
see amelioration
amelioration (n.)
In historical linguistics, a term used in the classiﬁcation
of types of semantic change, referring to the loss of an earlier sense of dis-
approval in a lexical item; opposed to deterioration. An example of the way
words ameliorate is mischievous, which has lost its strong sense of ‘disastrous’
and now means the milder ‘playfully annoying’.
amplitude (n.)
A term derived from the study of the physics of sound, and used
in acoustic phonetics, referring to the extent to which an air particle moves
to and fro around its rest point in a sound wave. The greater the amplitude, the
amplitude
23

greater the intensity of a sound, and (along with other factors, such as funda-
mental frequency and duration) the greater the sensation of loudness.
anacoluthon (n.)
A traditional rhetorical term, sometimes encountered in lin-
guistic studies of conversational speech. It refers to a syntactic break in the
expected grammatical sequence within a sentence, as when a sentence begins
with one construction and remains unﬁnished, e.g. The man came and – are
you listening? ‘Anacolutha’ have come to be especially noticed in linguistic
studies as an area of performance features which a grammar of a language
would aim to exclude.
analogical (adj.)
see analogy
analogy (n.)
A term used in historical and comparative linguistics, and
in language acquisition, referring to a process of regularization which affects
the exceptional forms in the grammar of a language. The inﬂuence of the
regular pattern of plural formation in English, for example, can be heard in
the treatment of irregular forms in the early utterances of children, e.g. mens,
mans, mouses: the children are producing these forms ‘on analogy with’ the
regular pattern. dialects also often illustrate analogical processes at work,
which the standard language has so far resisted, e.g. goed/seed/knowed for
went/saw/knew, etc., and this process is, of course, common in the errors of
foreign learners of the language. Processes of analogical creation are one of the
main tendencies in the history of languages, as when verbs which had an
irregular past-tense form in Old English came to be produced with the regular
-ed ending, e.g. healp becoming helped. See also exemplar, levelling.
analysable (adj.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to the charac-
teristic of a string in relation to a transformation. If the string meets the
structural description (SD) of the transformational rule, it is said to be
‘analysable’, and the rule is thereby applicable. For example, for the passive
rule to operate (in one formulation), the following SD is required: NP–Aux–V–
NP. A string such as the boy is kicking the ball would thus be ‘analysable’, with
respect to this rule; the boy has gone, on the other hand, would not meet the SD
of the rule, and would thereby be unanalysable.
analysis-by-synthesis (n.)
A theory of speech perception which credits listeners
with an internal, language-speciﬁc mechanism that responds to incoming speech
by selecting certain acoustic cues, and then attempting to synthesize a replica
of the input. When this is achieved, the synthesis has, in effect, carried out an
analysis of the input. Such a procedure, it is argued, has the merit of being
able to explain how listeners resolve the acoustic variability in signals, stem-
ming from the differences between speakers, contexts, etc. See also motor
theory.
analytic (adj.) (1)
A term which characterizes a type of language established
by comparative linguistics using structural (as opposed to diachronic)
criteria, and focusing on the characteristics of the word: in analytic languages,
all the words are invariable (and syntactic relationships are shown primarily
24
anacoluthon

by word-order). The term is seen in opposition to synthetic (and some-
times also polysynthetic) languages (which include agglutinative and
inﬂecting types), where words typically contain more than one morpheme.
Several languages of South-East Asia illustrate analyticity in their word struc-
ture. As always in such classiﬁcations, the categories are not clear-cut: different
languages will display the characteristic of analyticity to a greater or lesser
degree.
(2)
Considerable use is made in semantics of the sense of ‘analytic’ found in
logic and philosophy, where an analytic proposition/sentence is one whose gram-
matical form and lexical meaning make it necessarily true, e.g. Spinsters are
unmarried women. The term contrasts with synthetic, where the truth of the
proposition is established using empirical criteria.
analyticity (n.)
see analytic
anaphor (n.)
A term used in government-binding theory to refer to a type
of noun phrase which has no independent reference, but refers to some other
sentence constituent (its antecedent). Anaphors include reﬂexive pronouns
(e.g. myself ), reciprocal pronouns (e.g. each other), and np-traces. Along
with pronominals and lexical noun phrases (R-expressions), anaphors are
of particular importance as part of a theory of binding: in this context, an
anaphor must be bound in its governing category (‘condition A’). The term
has a more restricted application than the traditional term anaphoric. See also
anaphora.
anaphora (n.)
A term used in grammatical description for the process
or result of a linguistic unit deriving its interpretation from some previously
expressed unit or meaning (the antecedent). Anaphoric reference is one way of
marking the identity between what is being expressed and what has already
been expressed. In such a sentence as He did that there, each word has an
anaphoric reference (i.e. they are anaphoric substitutes, or simply anaphoric
words): the previous sentence might have been John painted this picture in
Bermuda, for instance, and each word in the response would be anaphorically
related to a corresponding unit in the preceding context. Anaphora is often
contrasted with cataphora (where the words refer forward), and sometimes
with deixis or exophora (where the words refer directly to the extralinguistic
situation). It may, however, also be found subsuming both forwards- and
backwards-referring functions. The process of establishing the antecedent of
an anaphor is called anaphora (or anaphor) resolution, and is an important
research aim in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. See also
anaphor, zero.
anaphoric (adj.)
see anaphora
anaptyctic (adj.)
see anaptyxis
anaptyxis /anapct}ks}s/ (n.)
A term used in comparative philology, and some-
times in phonology, to refer to a type of intrusion, where an extra vowel
has been inserted between two consonants; a type of epenthesis. Anaptyctic
anaptyxis
25

vowels are also known as parasite vowels or svarabhakti vowels (the latter term
reﬂecting the occurrence of this phenomenon in Sanskrit). An example is the
pronunciation of ﬁlm as [cf}lvm] in some dialects of English.
anchor (n./v.)
In non-linear phonology, an application of the general use of
this term to refer to a unit on which some other unit depends. For example,
root nodes are said to serve as ‘anchors’ for the features which deﬁne a
segment, and a segment to which another segment associates is said to be its
‘anchor’. A unit which is not ‘anchored’ may be said to be ﬂoating. The term
has a special application in prosodic morphology, in the context of the
phonological analysis of reduplication, where anchoring (which supersedes
alignment) is a constraint which places a structural restriction on the relation
between the base (B) and the reduplicant (R): in R+B sequences, the initial
element in R is identical to the initial element in B; and in B+R sequences, the
ﬁnal element in R is identical to the ﬁnal element in B. Stated more generally in
optimality theory, anchoring is a class of correspondence constraints which
requires that a segment at one edge of an input form should have a corres-
ponding segment at the same edge of the output form, and vice versa.
anchoring (n.)

angled brackets notation
see bracketing
animate (adj.)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of words (espe-
cially nouns) to refer to a subclass whose reference is to persons and animals,
as opposed to inanimate entities and concepts. In some languages, distinctions of
animateness are made morphologically, as a contrast in gender. In English,
the distinction can be made only on semantic grounds, apart from a certain
correspondence with personal and relative pronouns (he/she/who v. it/which).
In adjectives expressing the concept ‘old’, for example, elderly is animate, antique
inanimate; old is neutral, being applicable to either category.
anomalous sentences
see nonsense
antagonistic constraints
see grounding
antecedent (n.)
A term taken over from traditional grammar, and used for
a linguistic unit from which another unit in the sentence derives its interpreta-
tion (anaphoric reference), typically a later unit. In particular, personal and
relative pronouns are said to refer back to their antecedents, as in The car
which was parked . . . It was . . . An instance where the anaphor is to more than
one noun phrase is said to be a split antecedent, as in Mike suggested to John
that they should leave. Antecedent-contained deletion refers to cases where the
antecedent of an elliptical phrase itself contains an elliptical phrase. For ex-
ample, in Mary read every book John did, the elliptical VP after did is contained
in the antecedent VP, read every book John did. This kind of construction is
problematical, because if one tries to reconstruct the elliptical VP, the recon-
structed form will contain another elliptical VP, and this goes on ad inﬁnitum.

anterior (adj.) (1)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle
(see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to
handle variations in place of articulation (cavity features). Anterior sounds
are deﬁned articulatorily as those produced with a stricture in front of the
palato-alveolar area in the mouth. labial and dental consonants are [+an-
terior] (abbreviated as [+ant]). Its opposite is non-anterior, referring to sounds
produced without such a stricture, as in velar, glottal and vowel sounds,
which are [−anterior] ([−ant]). The related noun is anteriority.

anteriority (n.)

anthropological linguistics
A branch of linguistics which studies the role of
language in relation to human cultural patterns and beliefs, as investigated using
the theories and methods of anthropology. For example, it studies the way in
which linguistic features vary in order to identify a member of a speech com-
munity with a social, religious, occupational or kinship group. Any social situ-
ation can be explored from an anthropological point of view, such as everyday
interaction, ritual behaviour, political discourse, verbal art and educational
practice. The term overlaps to some degree with ethnolinguistics and socio-
linguistics, reﬂecting the overlapping interests of the correlative disciplines
involved – anthropology, ethnology and sociology. When the research takes
place primarily within an anthropological paradigm, the subject is known as
linguistic anthropology, and the practitioners as linguistic anthropologists.
anthroponomastics, anthroponymy (n.)
see onomastics
anthropophonics (n.)
A term suggested by Polish linguist Jan Baudoin de
Courtenay (1845–1929) for the study of the physical potential for sound pro-
duction in the human vocal apparatus. The ﬁeld includes the physical compar-
ison of vocal tracts and individual articulating organs in ethnic or racial
populations, to determine whether anatomical differences (e.g. tongue size)
have any phonetic or phonological consequences. Differences between the
sexes and changes with age are also included. One of the general aims of the
ﬁeld is to determine the principles on which the selection of the sounds in
individual languages might be based in the course of human evolution. The term
is not used by all phoneticians, many of whom see its subject-matter as simply a
part of phonetics.
anticipation (n.)
A term used by some psycholinguists to refer to a type of
tongue-slip where a later linguistic unit inﬂuences an earlier, as when catch
the ball might become batch the call.
anticipatory (adj.) (1)
A term used in phonetics and phonology as part
of the classiﬁcation of types of assimilation. In anticipatory (or ‘regressive’)
assimilation, a sound changes because of the inﬂuence of the following sound,
as when [t] becomes [k] in hot cakes. It is opposed to progressive and coales-
cent assimilations.
anticipatory
27

(2)
The term is also used with reference to the commonest type of
coarticulation (anticipatory coarticulation), wherein an articulator not
involved in a particular sound begins to move in the direction of a target
articulation needed for a later sound in the utterance. An example is the
nasalization which can be heard on vowels followed by a nasal consonant,
when the soft palate begins to lower in anticipation of the consonant during
the articulation of the vowel.
(3)
In grammar, the term is sometimes used for the kind of it found in
extraposition, where it corresponds to a later item in the sentence, e.g. It was
nice to see her. This anticipatory it (or ‘anticipatory subject’) is also referred to
as ‘extrapositive’ or ‘preparatory’ it, and is distinguished from the prop or
dummy it found in It was raining, etc. The term is also occasionally used for
the use of there in existential sentences (anticipatory there), e.g. There were
several people in the room.
antiformant (n.)
A term in acoustic phonetics for a particular frequency
range which absorbs acoustic energy because of the resonance characteristics
of a part of the vocal tract; also called antiresonance or zero resonance. A
spectrogram of nasal consonants and nasalized vowels will illustrate the
presence of antiformants (as white space) along with formants.
antipassive (adj./n.)
In grammar, a term used primarily to characterize a type
of voice in ergative languages (e.g. Dyirbal) which is the functional equivalent
of the passive in non-ergative languages. In these languages, the topic of a
clause is usually the patient, not (as in English) the actor, and the antipassive
construction handles cases where the actor is chosen as topic. Antipassive forms
are formally more complex than the corresponding ergative forms, with the
verb marked by a derivational sufﬁx. The use of an antipassive does not
exclude the possibility that passive or passive-like constructions may also occur
in the same language (as in Maasai). The term is also sometimes used with
reference to non-ergative languages, such as English, for certain types of appar-
ently intransitive construction – for example, verbs such as cook or paint
when used without their object. See also absolutive.
antiresonance (n.)
see antiformant
antonym (n.)
see antonymy
antonymy (n.)
A term used in semantics as part of the study of oppositeness
of meaning. Antonymy is one of a set of sense relations recognized in some
analyses of meaning, along with synonymy, hyponymy, incompatibility and
others. In its most general sense, it refers collectively to all types of semantic
oppositeness (antonyms), with various subdivisions then being made (e.g. between
graded antonyms, such as big ~ small, where there are degrees of difference,
and ungraded antonyms, such as single ~ married, where there is an either/or
contrast). Some linguists (e.g. the British linguist John Lyons (b. 1932)) have
reserved the term for a particular type of oppositeness: graded antonyms are
referred to as ‘antonyms’, the other type just illustrated being referred to as
28
antiformant

complementaries. It is a matter of controversy how many types of opposites
one should usefully recognize in semantic analysis, and the use of the term
‘antonym’ must always be viewed with caution.
aorist (n.) (aor, AOR)
A term used in the grammatical description of some
languages, referring to a form of the verb with distinctive past-tense or aspectual
functions, especially expressing the lack of any particular completion, duration,
or repetition. For example, in Ancient Greek, the aorist is chieﬂy a past tense in
the indicative mood, but expresses aspectual meanings in other moods. In the
traditional grammar of some modern languages (e.g. Bulgarian) it is restricted
to perfectivity in the past tense. The term aoristic is sometimes used in place of
‘perfective’ as part of the cross-linguistic discussion of aspect.
aoristic (adj.)
see aorist
A-over-A (adj.)
A term introduced by Noam Chomsky in the 1960s to charac-
terize a condition imposed on the operation of certain grammatical trans-
formations. The A-over-A principle (or condition) states that if a transformation
applies to a structure of the form [s . . . [A . . . ]A . . . ]s then for any category A
it must be interpreted as applying to the maximal phrase of the type A. Later
work made use of the notion of subjacency. See Chomskyan.
aperiodic (adj.)
see period
aperture (n.)
A term used in various models of non-linear phonology to
handle contrasts involving openness of articulation. In particle phono-
logy, for example, aperture is a privative feature (particle) representing open-
ness, and symbolized by [a]. Differences in vowel height are characterized by
combinations of aperture particles: for example, combining [a] with palatal [i]
results in a relatively open palatal vowel, such as [e]. In a constriction
model of phonology, aperture refers to the degree of constriction imposed on a
vocoid (a vowel or a glide), which dominates vowel height features. It is one
of the two main parameters of classiﬁcation for vocoids (the other being place).
The superordinate node is called the aperture node. In some approaches, con-
tour segments have been analysed as sequences of aperture nodes. A threefold
classiﬁcation is recognized: the total absence of oral airﬂow (as in oral stops), a
degree of aperture sufﬁcient to produce air turbulence (as in fricatives), and a
degree of aperture insufﬁcient to produce turbulence (as in oral sonorants).
apex (n.)
A term used in phonetics for the end-point of the tongue (also
known as the tip), used in the articulation of a few speech sounds, such as
the trilled [r], or some varieties of dental (apico-dental) sounds. Such sounds
could then be classiﬁed as apical.
aphaeresis /vcf}vrvs}s/ (n.)
A term used in comparative philology, and some-
times in modern phonology, to refer to the deletion of an initial sound in a
word; often contrasted with syncope and apocope. Examples include the
historical loss of /k/ in knife and such contractions as I’ve. Aphesis is a type of
aphaeresis – the loss of an unstressed vowel at the beginning of a word (’gain).

apocope /vcp∞kvpip/ (n.)
A term used in comparative philology, and some-
times in modern phonology, to refer to the deletion of the ﬁnal element in a
word; often contrasted with aphaeresis and syncope. Examples include the
pronunciation of and as /vn/ or of of as /v/ in such phrases as snakes and ladders
or cup of tea.
apodosis /apvcdväs}s/ (n.)
In traditional grammar, and sometimes now
in semantics, a term which refers to the consequence or result expressed in
the main clause of a conditional sentence; also called the consequent,
and opposed to the protasis, which expresses the condition. In the sentence
We shall get in if we queue, we shall get in is the apodosis, if we queue is the
protasis.

application (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the overall relation-
ship which exists between language and non-linguistic entities, situations, etc.
The ‘application’ of a linguistic unit is its use in a speciﬁc context; a unit is
said to be applicable to that context. For example, a lexical item may be
applied to a range of situations (none of which would constitute part of its
normal denotation or reference), e.g. heap being applied to a car, a house, a
sculpture. The term is particularly useful in the context of translation, where
pairs of apparently equivalent terms turn out to have different ranges of applica-
tion (or applicability); e.g. the use of merci in French differs from the use of
thank you in English. If items from different languages totally correspond in the
range of situations where they may be used, they are said to have the same
application.
applicational grammar
The name given to a type of categorial grammar
proposed by the Russian linguist Sebastian Konstantinovich yaumjan (b. 1916).
Its basic units are term (α) and sentence (β).
applicative (adj./n.) (appl)
In grammar, a type of double-object construction
in some languages (roughly corresponding to the direct/indirect object con-
struction in English). An applicative afﬁx on the verb encodes as objects a
range of roles, such as benefactive and locative. The construction can be
analysed as a type of voice, in which the focus is on the types of object rather
than on the relationship between subject and object. Applicatives are widely
found in Bantu languages.

applied linguistics
A branch of linguistics where the primary concern is the
application of linguistic theories, methods and ﬁndings to the elucidation of
language problems which have arisen in other areas of experience. The most
well-developed branch of applied linguistics is the teaching and learning of
foreign languages, and sometimes the term is used as if this were the only ﬁeld
involved. But several other ﬁelds of application have emerged, including the
linguistic analysis of language disorders (clinical linguistics), the use of
language in mother-tongue education (educational linguistics), and develop-
ments in lexicography, translation and stylistics. There is an uncertain bound-
ary between applied linguistics and the various interdisciplinary branches of
linguistics, such as sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics, especially as
several of the latter’s concerns involve practical outcomes of a plainly ‘applied’
kind (e.g. planning a national language policy). On the other hand, as these
branches develop their own theoretical foundations, the distinction between
‘pure’ and ‘applied’ is becoming more apparent, and the characterization of
research as being in ‘applied psycholinguistics’, etc., is now more regularly
encountered. See also pragmatics.
applied stylistics
see stylistics
apposition (n.)
A traditional term retained in some models of grammatical
description for a sequence of units which are constituents at the same gram-
matical level, and which have an identity or similarity of reference. In John
Smith, the butcher, came in, for example, there are two noun phrases; they
have identity of reference; and they have the same syntactic function (as
indicated by the omissibility of either, without this affecting the sentence’s
acceptability, e.g. John Smith came in/The butcher came in). They are there-
fore said to be in apposition or in an appositive or appositional relationship.
There are, however, many theoretical and methodological problems in deﬁning
the notion of apposition, because of the existence of several constructions which
satisfy only some of these criteria, and where other semantic or syntactic issues
are involved, as in titles and other designations (the number six, my friend John,
etc.). Sometimes the term appositive relative is used as an alternative to non-
restrictive relative.
appositive, appositional (adj.)
see apposition
appropriate (adj.)
An application of the general sense of this term in lin-
guistics, and especially in sociolinguistics, pragmatics and stylistics, to
refer to a linguistic variety or form which is considered suitable or possible
in a given social situation. For example, elliptical and contracted forms (e.g.
I’ll, isn’t, going to lunch?, etc.) are appropriate for relatively informal conversa-
tional situations; forms such as thou, vouchsafe, etc., are appropriate for some
kinds of religious situations. The point of the term is to provide an alternative
to the absolute implications of correctness encountered in prescriptive
approaches to language, where linguistic forms are held to be either right or
wrong, no reference being made to the different expectations of different situ-
ations. In pragmatics, appropriateness conditions for sentences are generally
referred to as felicity conditions.

approximant (n.)
A general term used by some phoneticians in the classiﬁca-
tion of speech sounds on the basis of their manner of articulation, and
corresponding to what in other approaches would be called frictionless
continuants, i.e. [w], [j], [r], [l], and all vowels. The term is based on the
articulations involved, in that one articulator approaches another, but the
degree of narrowing involved does not produce audible friction. In some ana-
lyses, [h] would also be considered an approximant (i.e. the voiceless equivalent
of the vowel following).
aptronym (n.)
A term used in onomastics for a name which derives from a
person’s nature or occupation, such as the English surnames Smith and Barber;
sometimes called aptonym. The name may be used humorously or ironically, as
with Mr Clever.
arbitrariness (n.)
A suggested deﬁning property of human language (contrast-
ing with the properties of other semiotic systems) whereby linguistic forms
are said to lack any physical correspondence with the entities in the world to
which they refer. For example, there is nothing in the word table which reﬂects
the shape, etc., of the thing. The relationship between sound and meaning is said
to be arbitrary – or ‘conventional’, as classical tradition puts it. By contrast,
some words in a language may be partly or wholly iconic, i.e. they do reﬂect
properties of the non-linguistic world, e.g. onomatopoeic expressions, such as
splash, murmur, mumble.
arbitrary reference
A term used in generative grammar, especially in
government-binding theory, in connection with the understood subject of
certain inﬁnitives, represented by big PRO. For example, in It’s easy PRO to
annoy John, the inﬁnitive has an empty PRO subject which is not controlled
(i.e. it is not co-referential with some other noun phrase in the sentence),
but is interpreted as ‘for anyone’. The reference in such a case is arbitrary. See
pro (big).
arboreal (adj.)
A term sometimes used in generative linguistics to describe
a tree structure. In metrical phonology, an arboreal grid is a modiﬁcation
of the metrical tree in which heads are vertically aligned with their mother
constituent nodes, resulting in a grid-like hierarchical conﬁguration of
heads.
arc (n.) (1)
A convention used in relational grammar to represent a direc-
tional dependency relation between a syntactic unit (or governor) and the
entities which constitute the relational structure of that unit. The ‘arcs’ in a
‘relational network’ are represented by curved arrows; alternatively, the depend-
ency relations can be shown as a dependency tree. Arcs are also an important
device in network grammars. Relationships can be postulated between pairs
of arcs, and these pairs of arcs can then in turn be interrelated in ‘pair networks’
(as is found in arc-pair grammar, a formalized development of relational gram-
mar proposed in the mid-1970s).

archaism (n.)
A term used in relation to any domain of language structure for
an old word or phrase no longer in general spoken or written use. Archaisms are
found for example in poetry, nursery rhymes, historical novels, biblical transla-
tions and place names. Archaic vocabulary in English includes damsel, hither,
oft, and yon. Archaic grammar includes the verb endings -est and -eth (as in
goest and goeth), and such forms as ’tis and spake. Archaic spellings can be seen
in Ye olde tea shoppe. See also obsolescence (1).
archiphoneme (n.)
A term used in phonology referring to a way of handling
the problem of neutralization (i.e. when the contrast between phonemes is
lost in certain positions in a word). In such cases as plosives following initial
/s-/, where there is no opposition (e.g. there is no *sgin to contrast with skin),
the problem for the phonologist is how to analyse the second element of these
words. To choose either the voiceless transcription /sk}n/ or the voiced one
/sg}n/ would be to attribute to the element a contrastive status it does not
possess. The solution suggested by the Prague School phonologist Nikolai
Trubetskoy (1890–1939) was to set up a new category for such cases, which he
called an archiphoneme, and to transcribe it with a different symbol. A capital
letter is sometimes used, e.g. /sK}n/. Alternative ways of analysing the problem
have been suggested, as in morphophonemic approaches.
archistratum (n.)
A term sometimes used in sociolinguistics, referring to a
privileged variety of language from which a community draws its cultured or
intellectual vocabulary. For example, Classical Arabic is used as an archistratum
throughout the Islamic world.
area (n.)
A term used in dialectology for any geographical region isolated on
the basis of its linguistic characteristics. The study of the linguistic properties of
‘areas’ – the analysis of the divergent forms they contain, and their historical
antecedents – is known as areal linguistics. An areal classiﬁcation would establish
areal types (or groups), such as the Scandinavian languages, or the London-
inﬂuenced dialects – cases where it is possible to show certain linguistic features in
common as a result of the proximity of the speech communities. Such a classiﬁca-
tion often cuts across that made on purely historical grounds. It is often possible
to identify a focal area – the region from which these linguistic characteristics
have spread to the area as a whole (as in the case of London) – and several other
signiﬁcant parts of an area have been terminologically distinguished, e.g. the
transitional areas which occur between adjacent areas, the relic areas which
preserve linguistic features of an earlier stage of development. Areal linguistics is
contrasted with non-areal differences in language use, e.g. contrasts between
male and female speech, and between some social varieties. The German term
Sprachbund (‘language league’) is also widely used in the sense of a ‘linguistic area’.

argument (n.) (A, arg)
A term used in predicate calculus, and often found in
the discussion of semantic theory, to refer to the relationship of a name or
argument
33

other term to the predicate with which it combines to form a simple proposi-
tion. For example, in the proposition, the boy is naughty, the boy is an ‘argu-
ment’ of the proposition. In case grammar, each underlying proposition is
analysed in terms of a predicate word and an unordered set of argument slots,
each of which is labelled according to its semantic (‘case’) relationship with
the predicate word. In later generative grammar, the term is used to refer to
any noun phrase position within a sentence (i.e. functioning as subject,
object, etc.). In government-binding theory, an argument is an expression
with a theta role, and the position to which a theta role can be assigned is
called an A(rgument)-position. An internal argument is an argument of the verb
that does not include the subject; an external argument is an argument of the
verb that does include the subject. External arguments may differ depending on
how a sentence is understood: for example, in John broke his leg, John is an
agent if John and his refer to different people, but it is a patient if his is
co-referential. The preservation of argument structure under morphological
operations is termed inheritance (e.g. verb-derived nouns in -ing allow inherit-
ance of all the input verb’s arguments, as in the putting of the ladder against
the wall). A preferred argument structure is a demonstrable discourse pre-
ference in a language for the use of a particular syntactic structure – for
example, a tendency for lexical NPs to appear as the subject of an intransitive
verb rather than of a transitive verb. An argument which is not overtly
expressed (as when the agent of a passive sentence is left unstated) is called an
implicit argument.
arity (n.)
see valency
arrangement (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to any sequence of
linguistic elements in terms of their relative position, or distribution, e.g.
the possible combinations of phonemes within syllables and words, or of
morphemes within words and sentences. This notion is fundamental to the
item-and-arrangement model of linguistic description.
article (n.) (art)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of words,
referring to a subclass of determiners which displays a primary role in dif-
ferentiating the uses of nouns, e.g. the/a in English. Many languages have no
article system (e.g. Russian). Of those which do, a distinction is usually made
into deﬁnite and indeﬁnite (or non-deﬁnite) types, partly on semantic and
partly on grammatical grounds. Articles may appear before the noun (as in
English), or after (as in Swedish). See also zero.
articulation (n.) (1)
The general term in phonetics for the physiological move-
ments involved in modifying an airﬂow to produce the various types of speech
sounds, using the vocal tract above the larynx. Sounds are classiﬁed in terms
of their place and manner of articulation in the vocal apparatus (the articu-
latory apparatus). Reference is usually made to the nature of the airstream
mechanism, the action of the vocal folds, the position of the soft palate,
and the other organs in the mouth – tongue and lips in particular. Any speciﬁc
part of the vocal apparatus involved in the production of a sound is called an
34
arity

articulator. Two kinds of articulators are distinguished: ‘active’ articulators are
the movable parts of the vocal apparatus, such as the lips, tongue and lower
jaw; ‘passive’ articulators are those parts of the vocal tract which cannot move,
but which provide the active articulators with points of reference, e.g. the roof
of the mouth, the upper teeth.
The study of articulation using instrumental techniques has emphasized the
importance of seeing articulation not as a sequence of independently articulated
sounds but as a continuum of sound production. This principle is obscured
through the use of phonetic transcription. The transcription [kæt] suggests
the existence of three discrete segments: what it obscures is the existence of
the transitions between segments, as the several articulators, working simul-
taneously, gradually move from one articulatory position to the next. Forms
of transcription which draw attention to these continuously varying (dynamic)
parameters are devisable, but they are complex, and lack the immediate read-
ability of the segmental transcription.
Several types of articulation can be distinguished. Most sounds are produced
with a single point of articulation. Sounds may, however, be produced involving
two points of articulation (coarticulation), in which case two articulatory
possibilities emerge: the two points of articulation both contribute equally to the
identity of the sound (double articulation or co-ordinate coarticulation); or one
point of articulation may be the dominant one (the primary (co-)articulation),
the other having a lesser degree of stricture (the secondary (co-)articulation).
Examples of secondary articulation are palatalization, velarization,
pharyngealization and labialization.
(2)
There is a second use of the phrase double articulation, within the linguis-
tic theory associated with the French linguist André Martinet (1908–99). He
used the term to refer to the two levels of structure in which language is
organized: speech can be analysed into the meaningful forms of language (i.e.
morphemes, words, etc.), and this constitutes a ‘ﬁrst’ articulation; these units
are then capable of further analysis into the meaningless sound units of language
(i.e. phonemes), and this constitutes a ‘second’ articulation. A corresponding
term in more widespread use is duality of structure.
articulator (n.)
see articulation
articulator-based feature theory
In phonology, a development of feature
theory in which speech is modelled in terms of a series of independently
functioning articulators (lips, tongue front, tongue body, tongue root, soft
palate, larynx), represented by nodes on separate tiers. Articulator features are
also called ‘place’ features, because they are grouped under the place constitu-
ent in the feature hierarchy. labial, coronal and dorsal nodes represent
single-valued features. Articulator-bound features depend on a speciﬁc feature
for their execution, further specifying the nature of a constriction formed by
an articulator (e.g. apical and laminal articulations are distinguished under
the coronal node through the use of the features [anterior] and [distrib-
uted]). Articulator-free features (or ‘stricture features’) are not restricted to a
speciﬁc articulator; they identify the degree of stricture of a sound independent
of the articulators involved (e.g. [+continuant] sounds represent a continuous
articulator-based feature theory
35

airﬂow through the centre of the oral tract, regardless of the location of the
major stricture). Among the claims made for this model are its ability to offer an
integrated account of vowel and consonant articulation in terms of place of
articulation and stricture: for example, in one model, features such as back,
high, and low, as tongue-body features, are linked under the dorsal node, and
rounding under the labial node.
articulator model
A theory which aims to integrate phonetics and phono-
logy into a single model, providing a feature analysis related to the muscular
activity underlying the movements of individual articulating organs. The
approach developed in the 1980s, and has inﬂuenced several later conceptions
of phonology, notably feature geometry.
articulatory analog
see speech synthesis
articulatory dynamics
A branch of articulatory phonetics which studies the
forces underlying articulatory movements (see articulatory kinematics), such
as the role of the jaw, the contribution of the relevant muscles, and variations
in subglottal air pressure. The subject aims to determine the quantitative
relations among the forces generated by the articulatory muscles, the inertial
and resistive properties of the articulators against which the forces are working,
and the resulting movements.
articulatory kinematics
A branch of articulatory phonetics which studies
the readily observable properties of the movements involved in articulation,
without consideration of the underlying forces (see articulatory dynamics).
The relevant parameters would include the distance, duration, acceleration, and
smoothness of an articulatory movement, or the direction of an articulator’s
displacement, the location of its end-point, and the force of its contact. Several
instruments are available to plot such movements, such as the articulometer,
ultrasound, and cineradiography. The subject is especially relevant in relation to
studies of speech rate and clarity.
articulatory phonetics
The branch of phonetics which studies the way in which
speech sounds are made (‘articulated’) by the vocal organs. It derives much of
its descriptive terminology from the ﬁelds of anatomy and physiology, and is
sometimes referred to as physiological phonetics. This area has traditionally
held central place in the training of phoneticians, the movements involved being
reasonably accessible to observation and, in principle, under the control of the
investigator. The classiﬁcation of sounds used in the international phonetic
alphabet, for example, is based on articulatory variables. In recent years, there
has been much progress in the development of instrumental techniques for
observing and measuring such factors as tongue, lip, palate and vocal fold
movement; examples include the palatograph, which displays tongue contact
with the palate; the electro-aerometer, which measures the relative ﬂow of air
from mouth and nose; the articulometer, which tracks simultaneously the
movements of several articulators; and electromyography, for the measure-
ment of muscular movement while speaking. Using such techniques, a far more
36
articulator model

detailed understanding of articulation is possible than using traditional visual
and kinaesthetic methods.
articulatory phonology
A theory which aims to integrate phonetics and
phonology, using basic units of contrast deﬁned as gestures – abstract char-
acterizations of articulatory events, with an intrinsic time dimension. Utter-
ances are modelled as organized patterns (constellations) of gestures, in which
the gestural units may overlap in time. The resulting phonological structures
provide a hierarchy of articulatorily based natural classes, which are used to
describe the phonological structure of speciﬁc languages and to account for
phonological variation.
articulatory setting
In phonetics, a global conﬁguration of all the articulators
in relation to each other, which one adopts and maintains during speech; also
called a phonetic setting. This accounts for some of the broad qualitative differ-
ences between languages and dialects, e.g. a characteristic nasal twang, or
marked degree of lip-rounding. Phonatory setting is sometimes distinguished:
a habitual setting of the larynx which results in such voice qualities as
whispery or creaky phonation. In the most general application, ‘phonetic
setting’ refers to any tendency towards co-ordination underlying the production
of a chain of speech segments, so that a particular conﬁguration of the vocal
apparatus is maintained. It thus subsumes coarticulation, assimilation,
vowel harmony and other such segmental features, as well as the non-
segmental effects noted in relation to paralanguage and voice quality.
articulometer (n.)
An instrument in articulatory phonetics which plots
the simultaneous movement of several articulators during speech. It is a point-
tracking device which uses magnetic ﬁelds to measure individual ﬂeshpoints, by
tracking the movements of tiny pellets attached to the articulators.
artiﬁcial language
A language which has been invented to serve some par-
ticular purpose. Artiﬁcial languages include those which have been devised to
facilitate international communication (where they are a type of auxiliary
language, such as Esperanto), programming languages (e.g. basic), languages
which communicate with computers or robots in artiﬁcial intelligence (e.g. shrdlu),
and simpliﬁed languages which are used by people with learning difﬁculties
(e.g. Bliss symbols).
ascension (n.)
A term used in relational grammar for a class of relation-
changing processes in which a noun phrase which is part of a larger noun
phrase comes to bear the grammatical relation previously borne by the larger
noun phrase. See also promotion (1).
ascriptive (adj.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to a sentence
of the type The cat is angry, where there is an attributive identity between
the pre- and post-verbal elements, but no permutability (unlike the otherwise
similar equative sentence – cf. *Angry is the cat, but Freda is the leader/The
leader is Freda). Sentences of the type Freda is a doctor are also sometimes
called ascriptive, but are more problematic to analyse.
ascriptive
37

aspect (n.) (asp)
A category used in the grammatical description of verbs
(along with tense and mood), referring primarily to the way the grammar
marks the duration or type of temporal activity denoted by the verb. A well-
studied aspectual contrast, between perfective and imperfective, is found in
many Slavic languages: in Russian, for example, there is a perfective/imperfective
contrast – the former often referring to the completion of an action, the latter
expressing duration without specifying completion (cf. the perfective form on
pro7ital, ‘he read (something)’, and the imperfective form on 7ital, ‘he used to
read/was reading (something)’. The English verb phrase makes a formal
distinction which is usually analysed as aspectual: the contrast between pro-
gressive (or ‘continuous’) and ‘non-progressive’ (or simple) duration of action.
The contrast between I was living and I have been living, and other uses of the
have auxiliary, are also often analysed in aspectual terms, but this analysis
is more controversial. Other English constructions have sometimes been ana-
lysed in terms of aspect, e.g. involving habitual contrasts (as in used to); and
in other languages further aspectual distinctions may be found, e.g. ‘iterative’
or ‘frequentative’ (referring to a regularly occurring action), ‘inchoative’ or
‘inceptive’ (referring to the beginning of an action). Aspectual be refers to the
use of the verb to be in some varieties (such as African-American English) to
express the recurrence of an eventuality, as in They be reading too fast. Aspectual
oppositions are sometimes viewed generally as semantic distinctions, but some-
times the notion is restricted to those oppositions which have achieved a
grammaticalized status in a language. In this respect, a contrast is often drawn
between aspect and Aktionsart (German, plural Aktionsarten, ‘kinds of action’),
aspect referring to instances where the opposition has been grammaticalized,
Aktionsart to instances where it has been lexicalized (especially, in Slavonic
linguistics, to instances where the contrast is expressed using the language’s
derivational morphology). An inﬂuential classiﬁcation derives from US
philosopher Zeno Vendler (1921–2004), who distinguished process and state
event types, dividing the former into accomplishment, achievement, and
activity types. See also realis.
Aspects model/theory
A commonly used abbreviation for the approach to
generative grammar expounded in Noam Chomsky’s 1965 book, Aspects of
the Theory of Syntax; also known as the standard theory. models similar
in principle to this one are ‘Aspects-type’ models. See Chomskyan.

aspiration (n.)
A term in phonetics for the audible breath which may accom-
pany a sound’s articulation, as when certain types of plosive consonant
are released. It is usually symbolized by a small raised [h] following the main
symbol. In examples such as English pin [ph}n], the aspiration may be felt by
holding the back of the hand close to the mouth while saying the word;
38
aspect

the contrast with bin, where there is no aspiration, is noticeable. Some lan-
guages, such as Hindi, have contrasts of aspiration applying to both voiceless
and voiced stops, viz. a four-way contrast of [p-], [ph-], [b-], and [bh-]. In some
phonetic environments the aspiration effect varies, as when in English the
plosives are followed by /l, r, w, j/: here the aspiration devoices these con-
sonants, as in please, twice, queue. Following initial /s/, the aspiration contrast
is lost altogether, as in [sp}n]. Sounds other than plosives may be aspirated, but
they are less commonly encountered. In a more detailed analysis, pre-aspiration
(aspiration before the consonant) can be distinguished from post-aspiration
(aspiration after the consonant); both features occur, for example, in Scottish
Gaelic. In nineteenth-century comparative philology, the term aspirate (or
aspirata) was applied to any sound involving audible breath in the articulation,
including voiceless plosives and fricatives. See also breathy.
assertion (n.)
A term used in pragmatics and semantics in its ordinary sense
of presenting information as true, but also more technically for that portion of
the information encoded in a sentence which is presented by the speaker as
true, as opposed to that portion which is merely presupposed (see presupposi-
tion). It is also used for sentences which present information as true, as opposed
to those which ask questions, issue commands, etc.
assign (v.)
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to the action of rules;
rules attribute, or ‘assign’, structure to sentences. By the use of rewrite rules,
a string of elements is introduced as a series of stages, each assignment being
associated with a pair of labelled brackets, e.g.
S → NP + VP
[NP + VP]S
VP → V + NP
[NP + [V + NP]VP]S
NP → D + N
[[D + N]NP + [V + [D + N]NP]VP]S
In such a way, the structure of noun phrase, verb phrase, etc., can be assigned
to any sentence to which these rules apply; e.g. [[the man] [saw [the dog]]].
assignment function
In formal semantics, a term referring to a function
which maps variables onto their semantic values.
assimilation (n.)
A general term in phonetics which refers to the inﬂuence
exercised by one sound segment upon the articulation of another, so that the
sounds become more alike, or identical. The study of assimilation (and its
opposite, dissimilation) has been an important part of historical linguistic
study, but it has been a much neglected aspect of synchronic speech analysis,
owing to the traditional manner of viewing speech as a sequence of discrete
words. If one imagines speech to be spoken ‘a word at a time’, with pauses
corresponding to the spaces of the written language, there is little chance that
the assimilations (or assimilatory processes) and other features of connected
speech will be noticed. When passages of natural conversation came to be
analysed, however, assimilation emerged as being one of the main means whereby
ﬂuency and rhythm are maintained.
assimilation
39

Several types of assimilation can be recognized. It may be partial or total. In
the phrase ten bikes, for example, the normal form in colloquial speech would
be /tem ba}ks/, not /ten ba}ks/, which would sound somewhat ‘careful’. In this
case, the assimilation has been partial: the /n/ has fallen under the inﬂuence of
the following /b/, and has adopted its bilabiality, becoming /m/. It has not,
however, adopted its plosiveness. The phrase /teb ba}ks/ would be likely only
if one had a severe cold! The assimilation is total in ten mice /tem ma}s/, where
the /n/ is now identical with the /m/ which inﬂuenced it.
Another classiﬁcation is in terms of whether the change of sound involved is
the result of the inﬂuence of an adjacent sound or of one further away. The
common type is the former, as illustrated above: this is known as contiguous or
contact assimilation. An example of the opposite, non-contiguous or distance
assimilation, occurs in turn up trumps, where the /-n/ of turn may be articulated
as /-m/ under the inﬂuence of later sounds. It also occurs in languages displaying
vowel harmony, where a vowel in one part of a word may inﬂuence other
vowels to be articulated similarly, even though there may be other sounds
between them.
A further classiﬁcation is in terms of the direction in which the assimilation
works. There are three possibilities: (a) regressive (or anticipatory) assimilation:
the sound changes because of the inﬂuence of the following sound, e.g. ten bikes
above: this is particularly common in English in alveolar consonants in
word-ﬁnal position; (b) progressive assimilation: the sound changes because
of the inﬂuence of the preceding sound, e.g. lunch score articulated with the
s- becoming /à/, under the inﬂuence of the preceding -ch; but these assimilations
are less common; (c) coalescent (or reciprocal) assimilation: there is mutual
inﬂuence, or fusion, of the sounds upon each other, as when don’t you is
pronounced as /cdväntàä/ – the t and the y have fused to produce an affricate.
In standard generative phonology, assimilation is characterized through the
notion of feature copying: segments copy feature speciﬁcations from neigh-
bouring segments. In non-linear models, a feature or node belonging to one
segment (the trigger) is viewed as spreading to a neighbouring segment (the
target). The assimilation is unmarked when a rule spreads only features not
already speciﬁed in the target (a ‘feature-ﬁlling’ mode); if the rule applies to
segments already speciﬁed for the spreading features (thereby replacing their
original values), it is said to apply in a ‘feature-changing’ mode. Further types of
assimilation can be recognized within this approach, based on the identity of the
spreading node: if a root node spreads, the target segment acquires all the
features of the trigger (total or complete assimilation); if a lower-level class node
spreads, the target acquires only some of the features of the trigger (partial or
incomplete assimilation); and if only a terminal feature spreads, just one fea-
ture is involved (single-feature assimilation).
assimilatory (adj.)

associate (n.)
In generative grammar, a noun phrase associated with there
in existential constructions. For example, in There is a picture on the wall, a
picture is the associate.

association (n.)
The general senses of this term are often found in linguistic dis-
cussion – the non-linguistic feelings (see connotation) which a lexical item
gives rise to, or the range of psychologically connected items which come to mind
(i.e. the word associations or sense associations). Some linguists have used the
term with a more restricted deﬁnition, however. For example, the Saussurean
conception of paradigmatic relationships was referred to as associative rela-
tions. Some linguists use the term associative ﬁeld (or association group) to refer
to a set of lexical items which display a speciﬁc similarity of form or sense.
association convention
see association line
association line
A term used in non-linear phonology for a line drawn
between units on different levels. The notion has been especially developed as
a means of linking tiers in autosegmental phonology. From a phonetic
viewpoint, these lines represent temporal simultaneity (or overlap), indicating
the relationship in time between the features represented at each tier, such as
tones and vowels. Segments which associate between tiers are considered
freely associating segments; segments which do not freely associate would be
ignored, in the application of an autosegmental rule. Once an association line
has been established, the association convention is used to relate the remaining
features: when unassociated features (e.g. vowels and tones) appear on the same
side of an association line, they are automatically associated in a one-to-one
way, radiating outward from the association line. Unbroken association lines
indicate associations that already exist; broken association lines (- - - -) indicate
a structural change following a rule adding a new association. Association
lines in a given representation may not cross (the ‘no-crossing constraint’). An
‘X’ (or similar convention, such as =) through an association line indicates that
the line is to be deleted by a rule. A circle round a segment means that it is not
associated to any segment on the facing tier. For example, the diagram below
represents a shift in a high tone from the ﬁrst vowel (in the input to the rule) to
the second.
Such shifts in association are known as reassociations. Multiple associations relate
a unit to more than one V or C slot. Because autosegmental phonology allows a
different number of elements in each tier and does not require that the boundaries
between them coincide, the notion of association lines emerges as central.

asterisk (n.) (1)
In linguistics, a linguistic construction that is unacceptable
or ungrammatical is marked thus by the use of an initial asterisk, e.g. *the
asterisk

×

man do been go. An asterisked form (or ‘starred form’) is a form which cannot
occur in a language, e.g. *walkedn’t.
(2)
In generative grammar (derived from mathematics), the asterisk is an
operator used to indicate any number of instances of a category (including zero);
also called a Kleene star. For example, YP* means ‘any number of phrases of
any type’.
(3)
In linguistic theory, non-conﬁgurational languages are also known as
W* (‘W-star’) languages.
(4)
In historical linguistics, asterisks are used to indicate a form which
has been reconstructed, there being no written evidence for its existence,
as in the sounds and words postulated for Indo-European, e.g. *s, *penkwe
(‘ﬁve’).
(5)
In early autosegmental phonology, an asterisk (also called a ‘star’)
marked a segment with a priority association, resistant to modiﬁcation
by later rules. The convention is also seen in some approaches to intona-
tion, where it identiﬁes a boundary tone associated with a stressed syllable:
H*, L*.
(6)
In optimality theory, a symbol showing the violation of a constraint.
asymmetric rhythmic theory
An approach to metrical phonology based
on an inventory of foot templates in which iambic and trochaic styles of
alternation do not display symmetrical properties. iterative iambic systems
use feet whose members are of uneven duration; iterative trochaic systems use
feet whose members tend towards even duration.
asyndeton (n.)
see syndeton
atelic (adj.)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of aspect, to refer to an
event where the activity has no clear terminal point. Atelic verbs include look,
play and sing (in such contexts as he’s singing, etc.). They contrast with telic
verbs, such as kick, where there is a clear end-point.
atlas (n.)
see dialect
atomic phonology
A model of phonology which speciﬁes the most limiting
conditions on the application of the phonological rules. These restrictions
are then taken to constitute the atomic rules for phonological processes (such as
devoicing), and variations are predicted through the use of universal princi-
ples. It is not limited to phonetic explanations, and adopts a methodology
which appeals to typological investigations for determining the constraints
on rules.
atomic proposition

atonal language
see tone (1)
attenuative (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in grammar and semantics,
referring to a reduced quality or quantity of the state or activity expressed by
42
asymmetric rhythmic theory

the verb (‘a little’, ‘less’). In some languages (e.g. Hungarian) the contrast is a
formal part of the aspect system.
attested (adj.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a lingustic form for
which there is evidence of present or past use. In historical linguistics, for
example, attested forms are those which appear in written texts, as opposed to
the ‘reconstructed forms’ arrived at by a process of deduction. In studies of
contemporary speech, attestation refers to something that is found in actual
recorded usage, compared with the hypothetical predictions of grammar or the
intuitive (but otherwise unsupported) observations of the linguist.
attitudes to language
see language attitudes
attitudinal (adj.)
A term sometimes used in semantics as part of a classiﬁca-
tion of types of meaning: it refers to the emotional element in meaning, as in
the different attitudes expressed by varying the intonation or loudness of a
sentence, e.g. anger, sarcasm. In the context of prosody, ‘attitudinal meaning’ is
usually distinguished from grammatical. Alternative terms include affective
and emotive; opposed terms include cognitive and referential.
attract (v.)
In the minimalist programme, a term which identiﬁes the driving
force behind move. A head is said to attract a constituent when it triggers
movement to some position on the edge of a head phrase.
attract closest
see shortest move
attribute (n.)
A term derived from auditory perception and used in auditory
phonetics to refer to an isolatable characteristic of sound sensation, e.g. the
attributes of pitch, loudness and timbre.
attribution (n.)
see attributive
attributive (adj.)
In grammatical description, a term normally used to refer to
the role of adjectives and nouns when they occur as modiﬁers of the head
of a noun phrase. For example, red has attributive function in the red chair, as
has Jane’s in Jane’s hat. The term contrasts with the predicative function of
these words, as in the chair is red, the hat is Jane’s. Some models of grammati-
cal description have extended the use of this term to include such complement
structures as he is my uncle, I called him a fool, and this usage can include the
adjectival use above (i.e. in she is happy the adjective’s semantic role in relation
to she is one of attribution). Ambiguity in this context is thus a real possibility.
attrition (n.)
see language death
audible friction

audio-visual integration
A term used in auditory phonetics, referring to the
way in which a percept may result from a combination of auditory and visual
inputs. The phenomenon was reported by British psychologists Harry McGurk
audio-visual integration
43

and John MacDonald in 1976, who noted that when hearing [ba] and simul-
taneously seeing a video of a face saying [ìa], the percept was in the ‘middle’,
[da]. It has since come to be called the McGurk effect or illusion.
auditory phonetics
The branch of phonetics which studies the perceptual
response to speech sounds, as mediated by ear, auditory nerve and brain. It is a
less well-studied area of phonetics, mainly because of the difﬁculties encoun-
tered as soon as one attempts to identify and measure psychological and neuro-
logical responses to speech sounds. Anatomical and physiological studies of the
ear are well advanced, as are techniques for the measurement of hearing, and
the clinical use of such study is now established under the headings of audio-
logy and audiometry. But relatively little pure research has been done into the
attributes of speech-sound sensation, seen as a phonetic system, and the rela-
tionship between such phonetic analyses and phonological studies remains
obscure. The subject is closely related to studies of auditory perception within
psycholinguistics.
auditory target
see target (1)
augmentative (adj./n.) (augm)
A term used in morphology to refer to an afﬁx
with the general meaning of ‘large’, used literally or metaphorically (often
implying awkwardness or ugliness). Examples of augmentatives include -one in
Italian and -ón in Spanish (e.g. sillón ‘armchair’, cf. silla ‘chair’). The term is
usually contrasted with diminutive.
augmented transition network grammar
see transition network grammar
autohyponym (n.)
see hyponymy
autolexical syntax
An approach to grammar, developed in the early 1990s,
which proposes autonomous systems of rules co-ordinated via the lexicon.
syntactic, semantic and morphological modules (formalized as context-
free phrase-structure grammars) are interrelated by a series of interface
principles which limit the degree of structural discrepancy between the repre-
sentations. An expression must satisfy the independent requirements of each
module to be well formed.
automatic (adj.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a morphological
variation which is motivated by the phonological rules of a language. For
example, the alternation of /-s/, /-z/ and /-}z/ in English plurals, possessives
and verbs is automatically determined by the phonology: forms ending in a
sibilant are followed by /-}z/; non-sibilant voiceless consonants are followed
by /-s/; and non-sibilant voiced consonants are followed by /-z/. More complex
automatic alternations are illustrated by sandhi phenomena.
automatic speech recognition
see speech recognition
automaton (n.), plural automata
A term taken from mathematics, where it
refers to the formalization of a set of rules for a computation, and used in
44
auditory phonetics

theoretical and computational linguistics as part of the frame of reference
for classifying languages which can be formally generated (see Chomsky hier-
archy). Automata (such as computers) can be modelled in abstract terms as a
series of inputs, outputs, states, and rules of operation. They typically perform
operations on an input tape by moving through a series of ‘states’ (or ‘conﬁgu-
rations’), each state being linked to the next by a ‘transition function’. The most
general automata are known as ‘Turing machines’ (named after British math-
ematician Alan Mathison Turing (1912–54), who in 1936 devised a logical
machine which deﬁned computable numbers by working in this way). The most
restricted kinds of automata are ﬁnite automata (also called ‘Markov sources’ or
‘simple transition networks’), which consist of a ﬁnite number of states and
state-transitions, and an input tape which can be read only in one direction, one
symbol at a time. ﬁnite-state languages can be recognized by ﬁnite state
automata.
autonomous (adj.) (1)
A term often used in discussing the status of linguistics
as a science: the implication is that the subject of language is now studied in its
own terms, no longer being dependent on the incidental interest of scholars
from other disciplines, such as logic, literary criticism, or history. The autonomy
of the subject is seen in the emergence, during the second half of the twentieth
century, of a wide range of degree courses in linguistics.
(2)
In phonology, the term is used to characterize the notion of a phon-
eme when no reference is made to its relationships with grammatical (espe-
cially word) structure. The autonomous phoneme, in this sense, is contrasted
with the morphophoneme, or the systematic phoneme of generative
linguistics, where other factors than the strictly phonemic are allowed into the
analysis.
(3)
Autonomous syntax is the view propounded by the standard theory
of generative grammar that the syntactic component of the grammar is
independent (‘autonomous’) of semantics, i.e. the factors which determine
the grammaticality of a sentence operate without reference to those which
determine the sentence’s meaning. For example, the sentence Colourless green
ideas sleep furiously is semantically ill formed but syntactically well formed.
This view was attacked in generative semantics, but prevails in modern
linguistic theory.
autonomous grid
see metrical grid
autonomous speech
see idioglossia
autosegment (n.)
A term used in autosegmental phonology for a segment
considered to be autonomous and represented on its own tier. The notion
is applied particularly to tones, which are viewed as segments in their own
right, independent of the consonant and vowel segments represented on the
skeletal tier.
autosegmental phonology
A term used in phonological theory to refer to an
approach which contrasts with strictly segmental theories of phonology. The
segmental approach is seen as a set of representations which consist of a
autosegmental phonology
45

linear arrangement of segments (or unordered sets of features) and bound-
aries that are dependent on morphological and syntactic criteria. By con-
trast, the autosegmental approach sees phonology as comprising several tiers,
each tier consisting of a linear arrangement of elements; these are linked to each
other by association lines which indicate how they are to be coarticulated.
Originally devised to handle tonal phenomena, the approach has now been
extended to deal with other features whose scope is more than one segment,
especially vowel and consonant harmony.
auxiliary (adj./n.) (aux, AUX)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation
of verbs to refer to the set of verbs, subordinate to the main lexical verb,
which help to make distinctions in mood, aspect, voice, etc.; also called
auxiliary verbs. In English the main auxiliaries are do, be and have, e.g. she is
leaving, does she know, she has taken. The modal auxiliaries include can/
could, may/might, shall/should, will/would, must, ought to and used to. The
class of auxiliaries is distinguished grammatically from lexical verbs in several
ways; for instance, they have a special negative form (e.g. isn’t, hasn’t, can’t, as
opposed to *walkn’t), and they can be used with subject inversion (e.g. is he,
does he, will they, as opposd to *walks he). ‘Marginal’ or ‘semi-auxiliaries’, i.e.
verbs which display some but not all of the properties of the auxiliary class,
include dare and need.
auxiliary element
see terminal
auxiliary language
In sociolinguistics, the term is used for a language which
has been adopted by different speech communities for purposes of communica-
tion, trade, education, etc., being the native language of none of them. English
and French are auxiliary languages for many communities in Africa, for example;
Swahili is used thus in parts of East Africa. This sense must be clearly dis-
tinguished from the use of the term to mean an artiﬁcially constructed language,
such as Esperanto. See artiﬁcial language.
avalent (adj.)
see valency
avoidance languages
In linguistics, a term used to characterize languages
which permit communication between a person and others with whom there is
a social taboo; sometimes loosely called mother-in-law languages or taboo lan-
guages. The concept relates chieﬂy to Australian Aboriginal languages, where
there may be strict taboos between certain relatives, such as a man and his
wife’s mother and maternal uncles. In Dyirbal, for example, the everyday lan-
guage is known as Guwal, and the avoidance language as Dyalnguy, which
would be used whenever a taboo relative was within earshot.
axiom (n.)
An application in linguistics of the general use of this term in the
branch of logic known as axiomatics. It refers to a set of initial propositions
(or axioms) which a theory assumes to be true. Further propositions (or ‘the-
orems’) are then deduced from these by means of speciﬁc rules of inference (to
which the term ‘transformational rule’ is sometimes applied). The full statement
46
auxiliary

of an axiomatic system will contain a ‘syntax’, which determines the well-
formedness of its propositions, and a ‘vocabulary’, which lists the terms of
the system. The application of these ideas in linguistics has come mainly
from the inﬂuence of Chomskyan ideas, concerning the formalization
of language, and is central to mathematical linguistics. In pre-generative
attempts at systematizing ideas about language, the weaker term postulates
was usually used. A speciﬁcally non-generative approach is axiomatic function-
alism, a paradigm of enquiry developed in the 1960s by J(ohannes) W(ilhelmus)
F(ranciscus) Mulder (b. 1919), in which linguistics is presented as a formal
axiomatic-deductive system within a broad semiotic frame of reference. The
approach applies a network of postulates, supporting deﬁnitions, and associated
theorems to the structural analysis of core areas of language as well as to areas
which are conventionally handled under other headings (such as pragmatics).
axiomatic (adj.), axiomatics (n.)
see axiom
axis (n.) (1)
A term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to intersecting
dimensions of linguistic analysis, especially those introduced by Ferdinand de
Saussure (see Saussurean). The distinction between synchronic and dia-
chronic is characterized as the ‘axis of simultaneities’ v. the ‘axis of successions’.
Likewise the syntagmatic/paradigmatic distinction may be referred to in
terms of axes (‘syntagmatic axis’, ‘axis of chain relationships’, etc.).
(2)
In some models of grammatical classiﬁcation, the term refers to the
second element in an exocentric construction, the other being the direc-
tor, e.g. in the garden, see the car.

Bach–Peters sentence
In grammatical theory, a sentence containing two noun
phrases, each of which contains a pronoun which is anaphoric to the other
noun phrase, as in [The pilot who shot at iti]j hit [the plane that was chasing
himj]i; also called the Bach–Peters paradox. Such sentences present a problem of
inﬁnite regress for certain theories of anaphora. The term is named after two US
linguists: Emmon Bach (b. 1929) and Stanley Peters (b. 1941).
back (adj.) (sounds)
Classiﬁcation of back speech sounds are of two types: (a)
those articulated in the back part of the mouth; and (b) those articulated with
the back part of the tongue. In many cases, these two criteria coincide: back
vowels are ‘back’ in both senses, as in English hard, talk, show, got, as are the
back consonants heard at the beginning of go, car and way. Consonants made
in the larynx or pharynx, however, such as [h], are ‘back’ in sense (a) only.
Back vowels are contrasted, in traditional phonetic classiﬁcations, with front
and central vowels. In the traditional classiﬁcations, sounds made at the back
of the mouth are distinguished from those made at the front; and those made
by the back of the tongue are opposed to those made further forward, by the
tip and blade (or front) of the tongue. In the distinctive feature analysis of
sounds proposed by Chomsky and Halle (see Chomskyan), the equivalent of
‘front’ is anterior, and of ‘tip/blade’ is coronal. Back sounds as a whole, in
their terminology, are a type of cavity feature (speciﬁcally, a tongue-body
feature); they are contrasted with non-back sounds, i.e. sounds produced with-
out any retraction of the tongue from the neutral position.
backchannelling (n.)
A term used in pragmatics and sociolinguistics, as
part of the study of listener behaviour in an interaction, referring to the
reactions given to a speaker by way of feedback. They include monosyllabic
responses (mhm), short phrases (I guess so), utterance repetitions and sentence
completions, as well as non-verbal cues (e.g. nodding, gaze variation).
back-formation (n.)
A term used in historical studies of morphology to refer
to an abnormal type of word-formation where a shorter word is derived by
A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics 6th Edition.  David Crystal

deleting an imagined afﬁx from a longer form already present in the language.
Edit, for example, comes from editor, and not the other way round. This deri-
vation presumably took place because native-speakers saw an analogy
between editor and other words where a normal derivational process had taken
place, e.g. credit/creditor, inspect/inspector, act/actor, the nouns being in each
case formed from the verbs. The derivation of edit thus reverses the expected
derivational pattern, hence the term ‘back-formation’.
backgrounding (n.)
see foregrounding
backlooping (n.)
A term in tagmemic grammar for the inclusion of higher-
level constructions within the slots of a lower-level construction, as in the
use of relative clauses within the noun phrase (e.g. the lady who was
talking . . . ); sometimes referred to as loopback. It is distinguished from level-
skipping and layering.
back-reference (n.)

bahuvrihi (adj.) /bwphupcvriphip/
In grammar, a Sanskrit term describing a type
of compound in which an entity is characterized without either of the con-
stituents directly naming it; also called an exocentric or possessive compound.
Examples include loudmouth (a person ‘whose mouth speaks loudly’) and scare-
crow (an object whose job is to ‘scare crows’).
balanced bilingual
see bilingual
bandwidth (n.)
An application in acoustic phonetics of a notion from acous-
tics, referring to an interval between two given limits within which a range of
frequencies falls. Speciﬁcally, it is the interval, measured in hertz (Hz), within
which half of a component’s acoustic energy occurs: for example, a formant
located at 1500 Hz with a bandwidth of 100 Hz would have most of its energy
within the range of 1450 to 1550 Hz.
bar (n.)
A mode of classiﬁcation of syntactic categories in X-bar syntax.
Most commonly, zero-bar categories, also called heads, are word-level cat-
egories; single-bar and double-bar categories, maximal projections, are phrasal;
single-bar categories are intermediate projections. single bars and double
bars are often represented by a bar over a category symbol (e.g. a, b;). The
alternative ways of representing bar(s) include primes (e.g. N′, N″), and numerical
symbols (e.g. N1, N2 or N1, N2). Zero-bar categories are sometimes represented
as N0 or N0. In generalized phrase-structure grammar, bar is a multi-
valued category feature which can take 0, 1 or 2 as its value. See also projection,
variable (3).

barrier (n.)
A term used in government-binding theory to refer to categories
whose boundaries restrict certain phenomena. A barrier is a node which blocks
the syntactic processes of movement and government: one barrier blocks
government; two barriers block movement. The principle that movement cannot
cross more than one barrier is known as subjacency. A is considered to be
an (inherent) barrier for B if A is a ‘blocking category’ for B: to be a blocking
category, A must not be theta-marked by a lexical (L) category, and A must
dominate B. Anything can be a barrier, apart from ip (inﬂection-phrase).
Other nodes can also become barriers for B if they dominate a blocking category
for B (the inheritance barrier) or if they dominate the nearest governor of B
(the ‘minimality condition’). The notion became increasingly important in
syntactic theory following the publication of Noam Chomsky’s Barriers (1986).
Barriers are also encountered in phonology, where they refer to any unit (e.g.
a boundary symbol, a segment) within a string which blocks the application
of a phonological rule to that string.
bar variable
see variable (3)
base (n.) (1)
A term used in morphology as an alternative to root or stem:
it refers to any part of a word seen as a unit to which an operation can be
applied, as when one adds an afﬁx to a root or stem. For example, in unhappy
the base form is happy; if -ness is then added to unhappy, the whole of this item
would be considered the base to which the new afﬁx is attached. Some analysts,
however, restrict the term ‘base’ to be equivalent to ‘root’, i.e. the part of a
word remaining when all afﬁxes have been removed. In such an approach,
happy would be the base form (the highest common factor) of all its deriva-
tions – happiness, unhappy, unhappiness, etc. This meaning leads to a special
use in prosodic morphology to deﬁne the portion of the output in corres-
pondence with another portion of the form, especially the reduplicant; often
abbreviated as B. See anchor.
(2)
In a more abstract approach to grammar (syntax as well as morphology),
the term basic form is used to refer to any abstract unit which has been set up
in order to allow a range of forms to be interrelated, i.e. seen as variants. In
morphology, for example, the basic or canonical form of a morpheme might
be identiﬁed as one of its alternants (e.g. the basic form (or ‘basic alternant’)
of the morpheme man is the morph man, with men being derived from this
in some way), or it might be a unit underlying both (e.g. a unit [mVn], where
both man and men are derived by some process of vowel (V) replacement).
Similarly in syntax a sentence can be seen as having a basic form from which
other sentences are derived (e.g. active underlying passive sentences, positives
underlying negatives), or related structures can be seen as being derived from
a common underlying form. generative grammar is the approach which
has exploited the potential of such analyses most fully. This sense of ‘basic’, it
should be clear, is different from the general sense used in language teaching or
learning situations, where (possibly in addition to the above) the implication is
that basic patterns of vocabulary are easier to learn, or are more useful for
communication.

base component
A term used in the standard model of generative grammar to
refer to one of the two main divisions of the grammar’s syntactic component,
the other being the transformational (sub-)component. In Noam Chomsky’s
Syntactic Structures (1957), the alternative term was ‘phrase-structure component’,
which speciﬁed the phrase-structure rules of the grammar. In Aspects of the
Theory of Syntax (1965), the same distinction (between base and transforma-
tional subcomponents) is made, but the roles of the two differ from the earlier
version, in relation to the theory as a whole. In Aspects, the base contains a
‘categorial’ component (specifying the categories, S, NP, VP, etc.) and a ‘lexical’
component (consisting of lexical entries made up of such features as ‘animate’,
‘human’, etc.). Taken together, the information in these components speciﬁes
the deep structure of sentences. In later versions of generative grammar, the
role of the base component receives further modiﬁcations, as the relationship
between syntax and semantics is investigated. See also universal.
basic expression
A term sometimes used in formal semantics for a lexical
item – that is, an expression which is not built up compositionally from
other expressions.
basic form
see base (2)
basic level
A term used in psycholinguistics, especially as part of proto-
type theory, to identify the most natural and informative level at which a notion
can be categorized. For example, shown a picture of a dog, people will say it is
a ‘dog’ rather than use a term at a more speciﬁc level (e.g. ‘Alsatian’) or at a
more general level (e.g. ‘animal’).
basilect (n.)
A term used by some sociolinguists, in the study of the devel-
opment of creole languages, to refer to a linguistic variety (or lect)
most remote from the prestige language (the ‘matrilect’ or acrolect). Basi-
lectal varieties are also contrasted with the intermediate varieties, known as
mesolects.
beat (n.)
A term used by some metrical phonologists for the grid marks at
the second or higher level in a metrical grid; the marks at the bottom level
are referred to as demibeats. The distinction corresponds in part to the strong/
weak form or stressed/unstressed distinction: beats or demibeats that coincide
with a beat at a higher level are strong; those which do not are weak.
behaviourism (n.)
In linguistics, the inﬂuence of this school of psychology
(the study of observable and measurable behaviour) has been most marked in
the work of the American linguist Leonard Bloomﬁeld. It can be seen in the
Bloomﬁeldian insistence on rigorous discovery procedures, and most not-
ably in his behaviourist account of meaning in terms of observable stimuli
and responses made by participants in speciﬁc situations. The limitations of
behaviourist (or ‘mechanistic’) accounts of language (especially that associated
with the work of the American psychologist B(urrhus) F(rederic) Skinner (1904–
90) were criticized by Noam Chomsky in the late 1950s, in writings which

innateness, mentalism.
benefactive (adj./n.) (ben, BEN)
A term used in some grammatical descrip-
tions to refer to a case form or construction whose function in a sentence
is to express the notion ‘on behalf of’ or ‘for the beneﬁt of’; also referred to as
beneﬁciary. A benefactive form (‘a benefactive’) expresses the sense of ‘intended
recipient’, and is often introduced by a for phrase in English, e.g. I’ve got a
book for you. See semantic role.

bidialectalism (n.)
In its most general sense, a term which refers to proﬁciency
by a person or a community in the use of two dialects of a language, whether
regional or social; also called bidialectism. Several kinds of bidialectal situation
have been studied, one of the best known being the switching from a casual
to a formal variety of speech (diglossia). More speciﬁcally, it is a prin-
ciple propounded in sociolinguistics and educational linguistics wherein
different dialects are attributed equal linguistic validity and recommended for
use in their appropriate social settings. The principle is of particular importance
in relation to educational policy in schools, where the differences between the
non-standard and the standard forms of a language can lead to considerable
conﬂict. Bidialectalism recommends that both non-standard and standard dia-
lects should be encouraged in the educational process, along with the fostering
of children’s abilities to use code-switching, thus developing a greater degree
of understanding and control over the varieties of their language than would
otherwise be the case.

big PRO

bijection principle (BP)
In government-binding theory, a condition on
logical form which states that a variable is locally bound by one and only one
A-bar position, and an A-bar position locally binds one and only one variable.
This bijective correspondence excludes weak crossover violations of the type
illustrated by *Whoi does hisi mother love ti?, which involve an A-bar position
locally binding two variables (the pronoun his and the trace). By contrast, the
principle allows Whoi ti loves hisi mother?, where the A-bar category locally A-
bar-binds the trace, which in turn locally A-binds the pronoun.
bilabial (adj./n.)
A term in the classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on the basis
of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made by the coming
52
benefactive

together of both lips. Examples are the initial sounds in pin, bin, mat; a non-
English bilabial would be the initial sound in Welsh mhen ‘my head’. The term
is restricted to consonantal articulation; the active use of the lips in the
articulation of vowels is discussed in terms of rounding and spreading. The
only common speech sounds in which a single lip is the primary articulator
are known as labio-dentals. ‘Monolabial’ is not found as a technical term;
‘quadrilabial’ exists only in humour, as part of the phonetician’s technical
description of a kiss!
bilateral (adj.) (1)
A type of opposition recognized in Prague School pho-
nology, distinguished from multilateral. The opposition between English
/t/ and /d/, for example, is bilateral, because these are the only units in the
system which are alveolar/plosive, and they are differentiated by the single
feature of voicing; the opposition between, say, /t/ and /v/, however is multi-
lateral, because there are other possibilities involving the same set of features,
e.g. /d/ v. /f/.
(2)
A lateral sound in which air escapes around both sides of the tongue, as
in the usual articulation of [l]; opposed to ‘unilateral’.
bilingual (adj./n.)
The general sense of this term – a person who can speak
two languages – provides a pre-theoretical frame of reference for linguistic
study, especially by sociolinguists, and by applied linguists involved in
foreign- or second-language teaching; it contrasts with monolingual. The focus
of attention has been on the many kinds and degrees of bilingualism and bilin-
gual situations which exist. Deﬁnitions of bilingualism reﬂect assumptions about
the degree of proﬁciency people must achieve before they qualify as bilingual
(whether comparable to a monolingual native-speaker, or something less
than this, even to the extent of minimal knowledge of a second language).
Several technical distinctions have been introduced, e.g. between compound
and co-ordinate bilingualism (based on the extent to which the bilingual sees
the two languages as semantically equivalent or non-equivalent, and being
represented differently in the brain), between the various methods of learning
the two languages (e.g. simultaneously or in sequence in childhood, or through
formal instruction), and between the various levels of abstraction at which the
linguistic systems operate – bilingualism being distinguished from bidialectal-
ism and diglossia. A balanced bilingual is someone whose command of
both languages is equivalent. Of particular importance is the way in which
studies of bilingualism involve the analysis of social, psychological and national
(e.g. in the case of Welsh and Flemish) concerns – such as the social status
of the different languages, and their role in identifying speakers with par-
ticular ethnic groups. In additive or elite bilingualism, a majority group learns a
second language without this being a threat to its ﬁrst language (e.g. English-
speaking Canadians learning French); in subtractive or folk bilingualism, the
second language comes to replace the ﬁrst (a common situation with minority
languages).

binary feature
A property which can be used to classify linguistic units in
terms of two mutually exclusive possibilities, such as in phonology the
presence versus the absence of vocal fold vibration, or lip-rounding. Binary
features are a major organizational principle of distinctive feature theories of
phonology, where it is conventional to mark the opposition using ± in square
brackets; e.g. a sound is characterized as [+voice] or [−voice]. Binary features are
also established in grammatical and semantic analyses of lexical items,
within generative grammar, where the same transcriptional convention is
used, e.g. nouns have such properties as [+common], [−common]. Binary features
stand in contrast to ‘unary’ and ‘multi-valued’ (‘n-valued’ or ‘n-ary’) features.
For example, in ‘unary component theory’ in phonology, binary notions (e.g.
[±round]) are replaced by single elements (e.g. [round]).
Binarity, or binarism, in this sense is relatable to the principles of binary
coding used in information theory, but the status of such contrasts in lan-
guage is often controversial, as it is not always clear whether the linguistic
possibilities available in phonology, grammar and semantics are best seen as a
series of binary choices. In immediate constituent analysis, for example,
which uses a binary technique for splitting sentences into smaller parts, it is
sometimes impossible to decide where a binary division should be made, as in
the case of adjective sequence (e.g. nice old red chair is not really divisible
into nice + old red, or nice old + red). It has sometimes been suggested that
binary branching is the norm in a phrase-marker; in its strong form, binary
branching requires that any node can have at most two branches. In cases
where binary features are used, it is sometimes possible to see one of the features
as neutral, or unmarked, and the other as positive, or marked.
bind (v.)
see binding
binding (adj./n.)
A term used in logic, and frequently encountered in gram-
matical and semantic theory, for the relation between a variable and a
quantiﬁer or other operator on which it is semantically dependent – norm-
ally the lowest operator co-indexed with the variable and taking it in its
scope. In government-binding theory it refers to a series of conditions
which formally relate, or bind, certain elements of a sentence. Two kinds of
binding are distinguished: A-binding and A-bar-binding (u-binding). The former
obtains if a category (an anaphor) is co-indexed with a c-commanding
noun phrase in an A-position (= argument-position). The latter obtains if a
category (e.g. a variable such as a WH-movement trace) is co-indexed with a
c-commanding category which is in an A-bar position (a position other than
subject, object, and object of a preposition), e.g. the clause-initial position occu-
pied by a wh-phrase. The extension (or generalization) of the approach from the
former to the latter is known as generalized binding. Elements which are not
bound are free. Binding theory is one of the (sub-)theories of government-
54
binarity

binding theory. It is primarily concerned with the distribution of NPs in a
sentence, determining the situations in which they can or must be co-indexed
with other NPs. The NPs are classiﬁed into anaphors, pronominals and R-
expressions (‘referring expressions’). The three principles of binding theory –
binding conditions A, B and C – are: (a) an anaphor is A-bound in its governing
category; (b) a pronominal is A-free in its governing category; (c) an R-expression
is A-free (everywhere). The binding inheritance principle is a reinterpretation
of the foot-feature principle of generalized phrase-structure grammar
within head-driven phrase-structure grammar.
binomial (adj./n.)
A term from mathematics (where it refers to an expression
consisting of two elements connected by a plus or minus sign) which is sometimes
used in lexicology to characterize two-element idiomatic collocations such
as spick and span or rack and ruin (a ‘binomial expansion’ or ‘a binomial’).
biolinguistics (n.)
A developing branch of linguistics which studies the bio-
logical preconditions for language development and use in human beings, from
the viewpoints of both the history of language in the race, and the development
of language in the individual. It is also known as biological linguistics. Topics
of common interest to the two subject-areas involved include the genetic
transmission of language, neurophysiological models of language production,
the anatomical parallels between human and other species, and the development
of pathological forms of language behaviour (see clinical linguistics). In
recent years, Chomsky has called his entire generative grammar an exercise in
biolinguistics, claiming that it is possible to ask a question beyond explanatory
adequacy: how did the language faculty evolve in the human species? See
Chomskyan.

bioprogramme/bioprogram hypothesis
A hypothesis in the study of creole
languages that creoles are the inventions of the children growing up in the
forts or on the plantations of the newly formed colonies. These children, who
would hear only the highly simpliﬁed structures of pidgins around them, used
their innate linguistic capacities to transform the pidgins into a natural
language. This account, introduced by Derek Bickerton (b. 1926), claims to be
able to explain the similarity and simplicity of creole languages: they are similar
because the innate capacity applied was universal, and they are simpler
because only the most basic language structures were represented. The study
of creole languages, in this view, provides special insight into the character of
universal grammar.
bipositionality (n.)
In some models of non-linear phonology, the repres-
entation of consonant or vowel length in two positions on the tier at
which phonological quantity is represented (e.g. the CV-tier, X-tier). A long con-
sonant or vowel is represented as a root node linked to two units of quantity.
biuniqueness (n.)
A principle in some approaches to phonology which states
that any sequence of phonemes will be represented by a unique sequence of
biuniqueness
55

phones, and vice versa – in other words, there is a one-to-one (or ‘reversible’)
correspondence between phones and phonemes in each utterance. For example,
in the word bin, the relationship between the two levels of analysis can be
shown as
56
bivalent
/b/
+
/i/
+
/n/
[b]
/i/
[n]
There are, however, several cases where this straightforward correlation does
not apply, and where the notion of a phoneme as a unique class of sounds
consequently is invalid. In such cases (see overlapping), one phone is assigned
to more than one phoneme, depending on the context. The biuniqueness con-
dition, along with the conditions of linearity and invariance, on which it
depends, was particularly criticized by generative phonologists, as part of their
general attack on taxonomic phonemics.
bivalent (adj.)

Black English Vernacular

blade (n.)
The part of the tongue between tip and centre, and which lies
opposite the teeth and alveolar ridge when the tongue is in neutral position.
Also known as the lamina, it is used in the articulation of several speech
sounds, such as [t] and [s].
bleaching (n.)
A term sometimes used in semantics to refer to a perceived loss
or dilution of meaning in a word as a result of semantic change. Examples are
the use of you know and I mean as pragmatic particles. Bleaching is often
identiﬁed as an important element in grammaticalization. See grammar.
bleeding (adj./n.)
A term used in generative linguistic analysis of rule-
ordering, and originally introduced in the context of diachronic phonology,
to refer to a type of functional relationship between rules; opposed to feeding.
A bleeding relationship is one where an earlier rule (A) removes a structural
representation to which a later rule (B) would otherwise have applied, and
thus reduces the number of forms which can be generated. If rule B is of the
form X ⇒ Y, then rule A must be of the form W ⇒ Z, where W includes Z, and
Z is distinct from both X and Y. In these circumstances, rule A is called a
bleeding rule in relation to B, and the linear order of these rules is called a
bleeding order. If the rules are applied in the reverse order, A is said to counter-
bleed B. Counter-bleeding results in a non-affecting interaction in which a rule
fails to realize its potential to reduce the number of forms to which another rule
applies. It is also possible in a pair of rules for each rule to bleed the other
(mutual bleeding).
blend (n.)
see blending (1)

blending (n.) (1)
A process found in the analysis of grammatical and lexical
constructions, in which two elements which do not normally co-occur,
according to the rules of the language, come together within a single lin-
guistic unit (a blend). In grammar, the process is illustrated by such syntactic
blends as It’s his job is the problem, a combination of the sentences It’s his
job and His job is the problem. In lexis, ‘blending’ is a common source of new
words through abbreviation (though not all become standard), e.g. brunch,
Interpol and Eurovision. The term is also used by some psycholinguists for a
type of tongue-slip involving the fusion of two target words, e.g. swurse for
swear + curse. See also loan.
(2)
A theory within cognitive semantics that seeks to explain how extended
analogies and complex novel metaphors are constructed and interpreted; also
called conceptual bleeding or conceptual integration.
block (v.)
see blocking
blocking (n.) (1)
A term used in classical transformational grammar to
refer to the non-application of a transformational rule. A rule is said to be
blocked if it cannot be applied to a derivation because of the occurrence of a
speciﬁc property in the phrase-marker. The term is also used in government-
binding theory to formalize the notion of what can act as a barrier. To be a
blocking category, A must not be theta-marked by a lexical (l) category, and
A must dominate B.
(2)
In morphology, the term refers to the prevention of a process of word-
formation due to the existence in a language of a word with the same meaning
as the one which would have been formed. Although we may obtain curiosity
from curious, English does not allow gloriosity, because glory already exists in
the language, and therefore blocks it. This notion of synonymy avoidance can
also be extended to such cases as went blocking goed.
block language
A term used in some grammatical descriptions to refer to
the use of abbreviated structures in restricted communicative contexts,
especial use being made of the word or phrase, rather than the clause or
sentence. Common examples include: No smoking, Exit, One way, and
‘headlinese’, e.g. Prime Minister shock.
Bloomﬁeldian (adj./n.)
Characteristic of, or a follower of, the linguistic approach
of the American linguist Leonard Bloomﬁeld (1887–1949), as exempliﬁed in
his book Language, published in 1933. Bloomﬁeldianism refers particularly to
the school of thought which developed between the mid-1930s and 1950s,
especially in America, and which was a formative inﬂuence on structural
linguistics. It was especially characterized by its behaviouristic principles for
the study of meaning, its insistence on rigorous discovery procedures for
establishing linguistic units, and a general concern to make linguistics autonom-
ous and scientiﬁc (in a behaviourist sense). A reaction against Bloomﬁeldian
tenets was a powerful force in producing generative grammar. Though
Bloomﬁeldianism is no longer fashionable, some of its methods are still widely
used in ﬁeld studies.

Boolean (adj.)
A term from mathematical logic (where it characterizes a type
of algebra in which logical symbols are used to represent relations between
sets); named after George Boole (1815–64), and widely used in computational
linguistics and certain kinds of semantics, where it elucidates propositions
linked by the three fundamental logical operations and, or, and not (Boolean
operators). Boolean algebra or logic is especially relevant in cases which deal
with mutually exclusive alternatives, such as binary features.
bootstrapping (n.)
In the study of child language acquisition, a suggested
discovery procedure whereby children make deductions about the seman-
tics or syntax of a language from their observations of language use. In
semantic bootstrapping, children are thought to use semantic information to
make deductions about syntax – for example, knowing something about the
meaning of a verb (e.g. that give involves a giver, a gift and a receiver) may help
them to work out semantic roles and thus syntactic realizations. In syntactic
bootstrapping, the child uses syntactic or morphological information to make
deductions about semantics – for example, using inﬂectional clues to distin-
guish types of word, thus providing a means of assigning preliminary meanings
to unfamiliar words. In prosodic bootstrapping, acoustic cues in the speech
signal (e.g. intonation, pause) help the child to identify syntactic boundaries,
even before lexical knowledge is available. The term derives from mythology
(where Baron Münchhausen saves himself by lifting himself up by his own
bootstraps) and computing (where it refers to a short program used to load a
longer program from disk into the computer, thus enabling the longer program
to operate the computer).
borrowing (n.)
A term used in comparative and historical linguistics to
refer to a linguistic form taken over by one language or dialect from an-
other; such borrowings are usually known as ‘loan words’ (e.g. restaurant,
bonhomie, chagrin, which have come into English from French), and several
types have been recognized. Less commonly, sounds and grammatical struc-
tures may be borrowed, e.g. the pronunciation of the above loan words with a
French or quasi-French accent, or the inﬂuence of English grammar often found
in European languages, e.g. using an English plural -s for a noun, as in drinks,
ski-lifts, goals, girls.
bottom-up (adj.)
In several branches of linguistics, a term which informally
characterizes any procedure or model which begins with the smallest functional
units in a hierarchy and proceeds to combine these into larger units; opposed
to top-down, which begins with the analysis of a high-level unit into progress-
ively smaller units. For example, in grammar, models which begin with mor-
phemes or words are ‘bottom-up grammars’, those which begin with sentence,
clause, or some discourse unit are ‘top-down grammars’. The distinction is
also used in the analysis of text structure in textlinguistics and stylistics, in
some approaches to non-linear phonology, in the teaching of reading (phon-
ics v. whole word), and also in relation to models of mental processing in
psycholinguistics and parsing procedures in computational linguistics.

Bloomﬁeldianism

bound (adj.) (1)
A term used as part of the classiﬁcation of morphemes; opposed
to free. A bound morpheme (or bound form) is one which cannot occur on its
own as a separate word, e.g. the various afﬁxes de-, -tion, -ize, etc.
(2)
A term used in logic, and frequently encountered in grammatical and
semantic theory, applying to variables which are semantically dependent on a
quantiﬁer or other operator. In the binding sub-theory of government-
binding theory it refers to constituents which have been formally related
through co-indexing: X is bound if it is an argument co-indexed with a
c-commanding argument. Its opposite is free. Some constituents (speciﬁcally,
anaphors) must be bound (A-bound) in their governing category, and some
(variables and R-expressions) must be free, otherwise the structures are ill
formed. Variables must be A-bar bound – co-indexed with a c-commanding
element in an A-bar position.
(3)
See formulaic language.
boundary-symbol
Symbols used in transformational grammar to indicate
the boundaries between structural units, e.g. the elements of a string (+),
or the boundaries of strings (#), e.g. # the+man+pres+have+en-+kick+the+ball#.
The notion has a central role in some models of phonology, where the do-
mains of phonological rules can be expressed in terms of phonological bound-
ary symbols. Boundary strength is quantitative, expressed by the number of
symbols present. A given phonological rule speciﬁes only the minimal boundary
strength across which it cannot apply. See also juncture.
boundary tone
In some analyses of intonation, a tone typically positioned
at the edge of a phrasal constituent. High (H) and Low (L) tones are
recognized as having important boundary roles, expressing such functions as
assertion, question, and continuation. An asterisk is used to identify a tone that
is realized on the stressed syllable (H*, L*), and a % symbol is used to show
that a tone associates with the edge syllable of a phrase (H%, L%). The notion,
applied to a wide range of languages, subsumes effects which are usually handled
separately (e.g. nuclear tone, syllabic accent, pitch accent). Utterance spans
which are dominated by boundary tones are intonational phrases. ‘Medial’
boundary tones are also recognized, positioned at certain points within a con-
stituent, marking an intermediate-level phrase.
bounded foot
see boundedness, foot (1)
boundedness (n.)
In metrical phonology, a foot-shape parameter which
governs the distribution of stresses. Bounded feet contain no more than two
or three syllables, and stresses fall within limited distances from each other
and from word edges. Unbounded feet have no restriction in size or on stress
distribution.
bounding theory
One of the (sub-)theories of government-binding theory,
which sets limits on the domain of movement rules. Its chief principle is
subjacency, which states that no movement operation can cross more than one
barrier. In extended standard theory and early GB theory, barriers to
movement were known as bounding nodes, commonly assumed to be NP and S.
bounding theory
59

bow-wow theory
The name of one of the speculative theories about the origins
of language: it argues that speech arose through people imitating the sounds
of the environment, especially animal calls. The main evidence is the use of
onomatopoeic words (which are few, in most languages). The term has no
standing in contemporary linguistics. See sound-symbolism.
brace notation, bracket notation
see bracketing
bracketed grid
see metrical grid
bracketing (n.) (1)
A technique used in linguistics to display the internal
(hierarchical) structure of a string of elements, in a similar manner to that
used in mathematics and symbolic logic. In the sentence The cat saw the king,
for example, the various intuitively motivated divisions it is possible to make are
each associated with the imposition of a pair of brackets on to the sentence, e.g.
distinguishing the cat from the king would lead to the representation [the cat]
[saw] [the king]. Each pair of brackets may be associated with a label which
indicates the grammatical reason for their presence (a labelled bracketing); for
example:
[the cat]Subject [saw]Verb [the king]Object
NP
NP
In a more sophisticated analysis, the order in which the pairs of brackets are
applied is also made explicit, as in phrase-structure grammar (here illus-
trated without labelling), for example:
Sentence unit [the cat saw the king]
subject/predicate (or NP + VP) [[the cat] [saw the king]]
verb/object (or V + NP) [[the cat][[saw][the king]]]
It is plain that, as sentences become more complex, the sets of brackets within
brackets will become increasingly difﬁcult to read. The tree diagram display is
the most widely used convention to overcome this difﬁculty.
(2)
Many of the abbreviating conventions used in writing a grammar involve
brackets. In generative grammar, the following kinds of brackets are widely
used to conﬂate rules:
(a)
parenthesis notation (round brackets) ( ) encloses optional elements,
e.g. a rule involving D(Adj)N refers to the potential occurrence of two struc-
tures, DN and D Adj N;
(b)
brace notation (curly brackets) { } encloses alternative elements, e.g. a
rule involving 
  
D Adj
N
N
⎧⎨⎩
⎫⎬⎭
 refers to the selection of only one of the two struc-
tures, either D Adj N or DNN. In other approaches these brackets are used to
indicate morphemes, or morphophonemic forms;
(c)
bracket notation [ ] requires that elements be matched along the same
horizontal row, e.g. 
  
A
B
C
D
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥→⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥
 
 
 reads that ‘A becomes C’ and ‘B becomes D’;
60
bow-wow theory

(d)
angled brackets notation < > signals an interdependency between optional
features in generative phonology, e.g. 
  
+
<+
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥→
+
<+
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥
A
B>
C
D>
 
 
 reads that ‘feature A
becomes feature C, and if feature B is present it becomes feature D’. In other
approaches these brackets may be used to indicate graphemes or a piece of
deleted material (e.g. feb<rua>ry).
(3)
In phonetics, there are two main uses of brackets: square brackets enclose
a segmental phonetic transcription or a distinctive feature notation (e.g.
[+grave]); slashes // enclose phonemic transcription.
(4)
Square brackets are also used to enclose features at a grammatical or
semantic level, e.g. [+common], [−countable], [+male], [−female].
bracketing paradox
In generative phonology, a term used for cases in which
two incompatible ways of ordering rules are both well motivated. A rule
can be applied to a substring containing the morphemes [A B], as part of a
string [A B C], even though the corresponding morphological constituent
structure [A [B C]] does not identify [A B] as a well-formed constituent. A
much-discussed example is the constituency of the word ungrammaticality, repres-
ented morphologically as [[un[grammaticalADJ]ADJ]ity]N. Because un- is a preﬁx
which attaches to adjectives, and not nouns, it needs to be shown to attach to
the stem before the -ity sufﬁx applies. However, phonologically, the opposite
situation obtains. Here, the representation has to be [[un[[grammatical]ity]1]2],
because the -ity sufﬁx triggers a stress shift (and other changes) in the stem,
and thus has to apply ﬁrst; un-, which causes no such effects, should apply
second.
branch (n.)

branching (adj./n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the descending
linear connections which constitute the identity of a tree diagram. phrase
structure rules which generate such trees are sometimes called branching
rules. The S, the ﬁrst NP, and the VP in the diagram are branching nodes; the
other nodes are non-branching.

branching quantiﬁers
A term used in semantics for a non-linear scope con-
ﬁguration of multiple quantiﬁers, in which two or more quantiﬁers take scope
over the same clause, but neither quantiﬁer takes scope over the other. For
example, in Most relatives of each villager and most relatives of each townsman
love each other, the quantiﬁers in either conjunct do not take scope over the
quantiﬁers in the other conjunct.
breath group (n.)
A stretch of utterance produced within a single expiration
of breath. Where and how often one breathes while speaking can be of signi-
ﬁcance for the linguist, in that the breathing pattern will impose a series of
pauses on the utterance, and these will need to be related to phonological,
grammatical and semantic structure. Within each breath group, also, it is
possible that certain regularities exist, such as a predictable pattern of promin-
ence or rhythm, and some investigators have used this notion as part of their
study of a language’s prosody (though terms such as tone unit are here more
widely used). More recently, the term has been used as a means of identifying
the earliest vocalization units in infants.

A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of voice quality,
on the basis of articulatory and auditory criteria. Breathiness refers to a
vocal effect produced by allowing a great deal of air to pass through a slightly
open glottis: this effect is also sometimes called murmur. Some speakers do
have an abnormally breathy voice quality, as a permanent feature of their speech.
What is of particular signiﬁcance for linguistic analysis is that breathy effects may
be used with contrastive force, communicating a paralinguistic meaning:
the whole of an utterance may be thus affected, as in an extremely shocked
pronunciation of Oh really! ‘Breathy voice’, or ‘breathy phonation’, is also
sometimes encountered as a phonological characteristic, as in Gujarati,
where there is an opposition between breathy and non-breathy vowels. See also
aspiration.
bridge (n.)
A term sometimes used in grammar to refer to a class of verbs
which allow long-distance extraction from their sentential complements.
Bridge verbs, such as say, contrast with non-bridge verbs, such as the manner-
of-speaking verbs whisper, guffaw and sigh, which do not allow such extraction:
Who did Mary say that John saw? v. *Who did Mary whisper that John saw?
broad (adj.)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of types of phonetic transcrip-
tion. A ‘broad’ transcription is less detailed than a ‘narrow’ transcription.
buccal (adj.)
A term occasionally used in articulatory phonetics as an
alternative to oral (as in ‘buccal cavity’), but more often with reference to
sounds made speciﬁcally within the cavity of the cheek. A well-known ‘buccal
voice’ is that produced by Donald Duck. See debuccalized.

bunching (n.)
A term used in articulatory phonetics to refer to a tongue
position in which the body of the tongue is held high and tense (bunched)
during the production of a sound, as in close vowels (e.g. [i], [u]), and fricat-
ives articulated in the palatal-alveolar area (e.g. [à]).
bundle (n.)
A term used in phonology to characterize one conception of the
phoneme: in the approach of the Prague School the phoneme is seen as an
aggregate (‘bundle’) of phonetic distinctive features. The English phoneme
/s/, for example, can be seen as a result of the combination of the features of
alveolarity, friction, voicelessness, etc.
burst (n.)
A term used in acoustic phonetics, referring to a sudden, short
peak of acoustic energy which occurs in the production of certain sounds, such
as at the release stage of plosives, and in some ﬂaps and trills.
byname (n.)
In onomastics, a supplementary name, added to someone’s per-
sonal name in order to help identiﬁcation, and sometimes replacing it com-
pletely. For example, several singers with identical surnames in Wales are publicly
known by their village of origin (e.g. Williams Penygroes, Williams Brynsiencyn).
History is full of bynames – Eric the Red, James the Bold, Ethelred the Unready.
A byname can in principle be distinguished from a surname, because it is not
its purpose to be passed on between generations; however, many surnames
undoubtedly started out life as bynames (e.g. Michael Carpenter).

C
C
An abbreviation in government-binding theory for the category com-
plementizer, generally abbreviated in earlier work as comp. This abbreviation
is associated with the idea that complementizer is a head of phrase category
broadly similar to noun, verb, adjective and preposition, with associated
single-bar and double-bar categories, Cc and C″. C″, usually referred to as
CP, is the largest unit of grammatical analysis (the initial symbol), equivalent
to S′ in earlier government-binding theory, lexical functional grammar and
generalized phrase-structure grammar.
calculus (n.)
see predicate (2), proposition
calque (n.)
(from French calquer, ‘to trace’) A term used in comparative and
historical linguistics to refer to a type of borrowing, where the morphemic
constituents of the borrowed word or phrase are translated item by item into
equivalent morphemes in the new language. Such ‘loan translations’ are illus-
trated in English power politics from German Machtpolitik, Superman from
Übermensch.

candidate (n.)
A term in optimality theory referring to a potential output
form. A set of candidates is generated and then evaluated so as to ﬁnd the
optimal choice – the one with the fewest lowest violations. it is symbolized
by + in an optimality tableau.
canonical (adj.)
An application in linguistics and phonetics of the general
sense of this term, to refer to a linguistic form cited as a norm or standard
for purposes of comparison. In phonology, for example, the normal syllabic
combinations of sounds in a language (or in language as a whole) are often
referred to as ‘canonical’, e.g. a consonant-vowel (CV) or CVC structure
constitutes a ‘canonical syllable’ pattern; an averaged waveform in automatic
speech recognition may be described as a ‘canonical waveform’. In mor-
phology the term is used sometimes to refer to the typical phonological
shape of morphemes in a language (e.g. CVCV in Polynesian), and sometimes

for the basic form in which a morpheme is cited (e.g. -s for the plural
morpheme in English). In syntax, canonical structures (such as word-order)
have been postulated, e.g. subject–verb–object, but this is an extended
sense of the term. In some sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic studies,
the normal position of human beings in relation to each other while convers-
ing (i.e. face-to-face) is called a canonical encounter or orientation. See also
template.
capacity (n.)
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to the generative
power of grammars. If a series of grammars generates an identical set of
strings (sentences), they are said to have the same weak generative capacity.
If in addition they assign the same structural descriptions to these strings,
then they have the same strong generative capacity.
cardinal (adj./n.)
A traditional term retained in some models of grammat-
ical description, referring to the class of numerals one, two, etc. Cardinal
numbers (or ‘cardinals’) contrast with the ordinal numbers ﬁrst, second, etc.
cardinal vowels
A set of standard reference points, devised by the British pho-
netician Daniel Jones (1881–1967), to provide a precise means of identifying
the vowel sounds of a language. The cardinal vowel system is based on a
combination of articulatory and auditory judgements. Four theoretical
levels of tongue height are recognized: (a) the highest position to which the
tongue can be raised without producing audible friction; (b) the lowest posi-
tion the tongue is capable of achieving; (c) and (d), two intermediate levels,
which divide up the intervening space into areas that are articulatorily and
auditorily equidistant. Using the front of the tongue, and without rounding the
lips, four primary vowel types are produced, and these are given the symbols
(from high to low) [i], [e] [ε] and [a]. Using the back of the tongue, four more
primary vowel types are recognized, symbolized as (from low to high) [w], [Ñ],
[o] and [u] – the last three involving lip-rounding. In addition, each of these
primary values is coded numerically, from 1 to 8 respectively.
By reversing the lip position, a secondary series of vowel types is produced:
rounding the lips for the front vowels produces (from high to low) [y], [ø], [œ]
and [Œ]; [∞] is the rounded equivalent of cardinal 5, and [Î], [©] and [„] are the
unrounded equivalents of cardinals 6, 7 and 8 respectively. The numerical code for
the secondary series runs from 9 to 16. Two further cardinal vowels represent
the highest point the centre of the tongue can reach: these are symbolized by [÷]
for the unrounded vowel and by [Í] for the rounded vowel, coded 17 and 18
respectively. The entire system is usually shown in the form of the cardinal vowel
diagram, or cardinal vowel quadrilateral, in which the aim is to give an approx-
imate picture of the degree and direction of tongue movement involved. Addi-
tional lines help to delimit the area in which central vowel sounds are made. It
should be emphasized that the cardinal vowels are not real vowels: they are
invariable reference points (available as a recording), which have to be learned
by rote. Once learned, phoneticians can use them in order to locate the position
of the vowels of a language or to compare the vowels of different languages
or dialects. They can be sure that the vowels will all fall somewhere within the
boundaries of the cardinal area. diacritic marks can then be used to plot vowel
cardinal vowels
65

positions more accurately, e.g. a plus beneath the vowel means that the articula-
tion is more advanced than the cardinal value (as in [u+]), a line beneath the
vowel means that the articulation is more retracted (as in [e−]).
Several other suggestions have been made concerning the best way of dividing
up the vowel articulation area, but Daniel Jones’s system is still the most widely
used. Where symbols appear in pairs, the one to the right represents a rounded
vowel.

Cartesian linguistics
A term used by some linguists to refer to any linguistic
theories or methods which, it is claimed, illustrate the inﬂuence of the French
philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) and the grammarians of Port Royal.
The discussion of universals in generative linguistics, in particular, draws
certain parallels with Cartesian views concerning the relationship between lan-
guage and thought. This interpretation of the history of linguistic thought has
remained controversial, since its initial statement by Noam Chomsky (see Lan-
guage and Mind (1968)). See also Chomskyan.
case (n.) (1)
A grammatical category used in the analysis of word-classes
(or their associated phrases) to identify the syntactic relationship between
words in a sentence, through such contrasts as nominative, accusative, etc.
The traditional classiﬁcation, such as is found in Latin grammar, is based
on variations in the morphological forms of the word (a set of such forms
constituting a paradigm, as in Latin puella, puellam, puellae, puella, the singu-
lar case forms of ‘girl’ – respectively nominative/vocative, accusative, genitive/
dative and ablative). Each form is analysed in terms of a speciﬁc range of
meaning; e.g. nominative is primarily the case of the grammatical subject of the
sentence, genitive refers to such notions as possession, origin, and so on.
In languages which lack morphological variations of this kind, the term ‘case’,
as traditionally used, does not apply. In English, for example, the only case form
which is so marked is the genitive (as in boy’s or boys’); all other forms have
no ending, the remaining case ‘meanings’ being expressed using prepositions
(as in with a boy, to the boy) or word-order (as in the cat chases mouse/mouse
chases cat contrast). A great deal of space in introductions to linguistics has

been devoted to this point, in particular to criticism of traditional grammars
of English which insisted nonetheless on analysing the English noun in terms of
cases. In some languages, highly complex morphological systems are encoun-
tered – according to some, Finnish can be analysed as having sixteen cases, for
example – along with a correspondingly complex descriptive terminology (using
such terms as inessive (‘in’ a place), elative (‘from inside’ a place) and illative
(‘into’ a place)).
(2)
When written with a capital C (Case), the term refers to an abstract notion
which is distinct from the morphologically marked case described under
(1) above. Abstract Case (or deep Case) is present even in languages (such as
Chinese) which lack morphological case on noun phrases; it is usually assumed
to be congruent with morphological case when such features are present. Case
theory is one of the (sub-)theories of government-binding theory: it deals
with the assignment of abstract Case and its morphological realizations, restrict-
ing the distribution of lexical NPs at S-structure. Structural Case is assigned
to NPs at S-structure; inherent Case is assigned to NPs in D-structure. Case-
marking rules assign structural Case to certain NP positions (e.g. objective,
where the NP is governed by a transitive verb or preposition), and the
Case ﬁlter restricts the range of sentences which can be generated in this way,
making movement of the object-NP to the subject position obligatory in passives,
and preventing the appearance of an adverbial between a verb and its object.
Case theory in this sense must be clearly distinguished from that outlined in
case grammar. In the minimalist programme, Case-marking is expressed as
Case-checking.
case grammar
An approach to grammatical analysis devised by the American
linguist Charles Fillmore (b. 1929) in the late 1960s, within the general orienta-
tion of generative grammar. It is primarily a reaction against the standard-
theory analysis of sentences, where notions such as subject, object, etc., are
neglected in favour of analyses in terms of NP, VP, etc. By focusing on syntactic
functions, however, it was felt that several important kinds of semantic rela-
tionship could be represented, which it would otherwise be difﬁcult or imposs-
ible to capture. A set of sentences such as The key opened the door, The door
was opened by/with the key, The door opened, The man opened the door with
a key, etc., illustrate several ‘stable’ semantic roles, despite the varying surface
grammatical structures. In each case the key is ‘instrumental’, the door is the
entity affected by the action, and so on. Case grammar formalizes this insight
using a model which shows the inﬂuence of the predicate calculus of formal
logic: the deep structure of a sentence has two constituents, modality
(features of tense, mood, aspect and negation, relating to the sentence as a
whole) and proposition (within which the verb is considered central, and the
various semantic roles that elements of structure can have are listed with
reference to it, and categorized as cases).
The term ‘case’ is used because of the similarity with several of the tradi-
tional meanings covered by this term (see case (1)), but the deep-structure cases
recognized by the theory do not systematically correspond with anything in the
surface morphology or syntax. The original proposal set up six cases (agentive,
instrumental, dative, factitive, locative and objective) and gave rules
for their combination in deﬁning the use of verbs, e.g. a verb like open can be
case grammar
67

used with an objective and instrumental case (e.g. The key opened the door),
or with an additional agent (e.g. The man opened the door with a key). Later,
other cases were suggested (source, goal, counter-agent), some cases were
reinterpreted and relabelled (see experiencer, result), and certain cases came
to be given special study, it being claimed that they were more fundamental
(location and direction, in particular). In a locative or localist case theory, for
example, structures such as there is a table, the table has legs, the table’s legs,
and many more, could each be analysed as having an underlying locational
feature. The problems in formalizing this conception of linguistic structure have
remained very great, and case grammar came to attract somewhat less interest in
the mid-1970s; but it has proved to be inﬂuential on the terminology and
classiﬁcation of several later theories, especially the theory of thematic roles.
See also frame, theme.
cataphora (n.)
A term used by some grammarians for the process or result of
a linguistic unit referring forward to another unit. Cataphoric reference is
one way of marking the identity between what is being expressed and what is
about to be expressed: for example, I said this/the following . . . , where the
meaning of this and the following must be speciﬁed in the subsequent context.
Here is the 9 o’clock news shows the cataphoric function of here. Cataphoric
words (or ‘substitutes’) are usually contrasted with anaphoric words (which
refer backwards), and sometimes with exophoric words (which refer directly
to the extralinguistic situation).

categorical perception
A term used in phonetics and psycholinguistics to
refer to a class of discontinuities in the labelling and discrimination of items
along acoustic phonetic continua. Subjects typically perceive differences in
stimuli between those items that are labelled as belonging to different categories;
but increasing the sensitivity of the measures allows some awareness of differ-
ences within the same category.
categorization (n.)
see category
category (n.)
A general term used in linguistics at varying levels of abstrac-
tion. At its most general level, categorization refers to the whole process of
organizing human experience into general concepts with their associated lin-
guistic labels; the linguistic study of this process (in semantics) overlaps with
that of philosophers and psychologists. In the ﬁeld of grammar, categorization
refers to the establishment of a set of classiﬁcatory units or properties used
in the description of language, which have the same basic distribution, and
which occur as a structural unit throughout the language. In the course of
language change, there may be alterations in the category status of a unit
(recategorization). The term category in some approaches refers to the classes
themselves, e.g. noun, verb, subject, predicate, noun phrase, verb phrase
(any associated abbreviations being referred to as category symbols). More
68
cataphora

speciﬁcally, it refers to the deﬁning properties of these general units: the categor-
ies of the noun, for example, include number, gender, case and countability;
of the verb, tense, aspect, voice, etc. A distinction is often made between
grammatical categories, in this second sense, and grammatical functions (or
functional categories), such as subject, object, complement.
While both of these senses of ‘category’ are widespread, several speciﬁc appli-
cations of the term have developed within individual theories. For example, in
scale-and-category grammar, ‘category’ is used primarily to refer to the
notions of class, system, unit and structure, which the theory recognized as
basic. It is also distinguished from segment in Chomsky-adjunction. Most
distinctive of all, perhaps, is the special status given to the term in theories of
categorial grammar, a type of formal grammar devised by logicians in the
1920s and 1930s, and developed by several linguists in the 1950s (in particular
by Yehoshua Bar Hillel (1915–75)). Its distinctive mode of operation involves
the deriving of categories from more basic categories: for any two categories,
P and Q, there is a complex category of the type P/Q, which represents the
operations which may be performed on a given word. For example, given the
basic categories N (noun) and S (sentence), an item such as go would be assigned
N/S, thereby capturing its intransitive status (i.e. go can combine with a
preceding N to produce S). More complex structures can be reduced to simpler
ones using a set of syntactic operations, in which the notion of ‘cancellation’ is
especially important (e.g. P followed by P/Q reduces to Q).
In generative grammar, the set of phrase-structure rules in a grammar
may be referred to as the categorial component, i.e. that part of the base
component of the grammar which speciﬁes such syntactic categories as S, NP,
VP. A categorial rule is a rule which expands a category into other categories.
Also, in some models of generative grammar, the term category feature is used
to refer to a type of contextual feature, i.e. a syntactic feature which speciﬁes
the conditions relating to where in a deep structure a lexical item can
occur. Category features specify which node will be the one to dominate
directly the lexical item, once it is introduced into the phrase-marker (replac-
ing the corresponding empty (delta) symbol, e.g. [+N], [+Det], [+V]). A cat-
egory variable is a symbol which stands for any lexical category. A related term
in this model is strict sub-categorization, referring to features which specify
further restrictions on the choice of lexical items in deep structure. See also
empty (1), govern (2), higher category, type shifting.

catenative (adj./n.)
A term used in some grammatical descriptions of the
verb phrase to refer to a lexical verb (‘a catenative’) which governs the non-
ﬁnite form of another lexical verb, as in one possible analysis of she likes to
write, she wants to see, she hates waiting, etc. In generative grammar, such
constructions are known as control and raising constructions.
causal chain theory
In semantics, the hypothesis that the denotation of a
proper name or other expression is determined by the historical chain of
causal chain theory
69

cause and effect leading from the initial bestowal of the name up through its
acquisition by the speaker. The theory was proposed by philosopher Saul (Aaron)
Kripke (b. 1940) in the 1970s as an alternative to the view that denotation is
determined by mental description or other features of the speaker’s psycholo-
gical state.
causative (adj./n.) (caus, CAUS)
A term used in grammatical description to
refer to the causal relationship between alternative versions of a sentence. For
example, the pair of sentences The cat killed the mouse and The mouse died are
related, in that the transitive kill can be seen as a ‘causative’ version of the
intransitive die, viz. ‘cause to die’ (The cat caused the mouse to die); similarly,
some afﬁxes have a causative role, e.g. -ize, as in domesticize (= ‘cause to
become domestic’). This is a relationship which is clearly established in the
morphological structure of some languages (e.g. Japanese, Turkish), where
an afﬁx can systematically distinguish between non-causative and causative
uses of a verb (‘causative verbs’ or ‘causatives’), e.g. ‘she eats’, ‘she causes
(someone) to eat’, which is similar to English she makes him eat. Some linguists
have also tried to apply the notion of causative systematically to English, seeing
it as an abstract underlying category from which sets of ‘surface’ verbs (such
as kill and die) can be derived.
cavity (n.) (1)
In phonetics, this term refers to any of the anatomically de-
ﬁned chambers in the vocal tract which are the principal formative inﬂuences
on the character of a sound. The main cavities are: (a) the oesophageal cavity,
from oesophagus to stomach, which is used only in abnormal speech produc-
tion, such as following a laryngectomy operation; (b) the pulmonic cavity,
made up of the lungs and trachea, which is the normal source of speech sounds;
(c) the pharyngeal cavity, from the larynx to the point where the soft palate
makes contact with the back of the throat; (d) the oral cavity, made up of the
whole of the mouth area, and the main means of modifying the resonance of
the sound produced at the larynx; sometimes referred to as buccal; (e) the
nasal cavity, made up of the nose and the part of the pharynx above the point
of soft palate closure.
(2)
In Chomsky and Halle’s distinctive feature theory of phonology (see
Chomskyan), cavity features constitute one of the ﬁve main dimensions in
terms of which speech sounds are analysed (the others being major class
features, manner of articulation features, source features, and pro-
sodic features). The features subsumed under this heading, all analysed as
oppositions, are coronal, anterior, tongue-body features (high/low/
back), rounded, distributed, covered, glottal constrictions, and second-
ary apertures (nasal and lateral). In some models of feature geometry,
an oral cavity node is introduced, corresponding to the articulatory notion of an
oral cavity constriction. It is represented between the root node and the
place node, thus dominating place and [±continuant] nodes.

ceneme (n.) (1)
A term used in glossematics to refer to the minimal unit in
a language’s phonological system. Cenematics and cenetics are the terms used
to refer to the analysis of cenemes at levels corresponding to those of phono-
logy and phonetics respectively.
(2)
In the study of writing systems, a sign which denotes only linguistic form;
opposed to plereme, where meaning is also involved. There are two main types:
syllabaries (e.g. Japanese kana) and alphabets. Systems of cenemic signs are
more economical in their use of elementary units, and are often thought to
represent a more advanced state of writing.
centre (n.) (1)
The top part of the tongue, between front and back, and
used especially in the production of ‘central vowels’ (also called ‘neutral’
vowels), such as the [v] sound which opens the word asleep and closes the word
sofa. In a sense, when compared with the theoretical extremes of vowel articu-
lation which deﬁne the cardinal vowels in phonetics, all real language
vowels are centralized; but the term is usually used to refer to cases where a
vowel normally articulated in the periphery of the vowel area comes to be
produced nearer the centre of the mouth, as when bacon and [= and] eggs
becomes, in normal colloquial speech, bacon [vnd] eggs. Several degrees of
this process of centralization can be heard. Markedly ‘centralized vowels’ are
common in several urban British dialects, for example. A diphthong which
involves a glide towards the centre of the mouth may be referred to as a
‘centring’ diphthong.
(2)
The most sonorous part of a syllable may be referred to as the ‘centre’
(or nucleus), e.g. the [up] in the word boot [bupt].
(3)
In those types of grammatical phrase where several words depend on one
head word (endocentric constructions), the head is often referred to as the
‘centre’ of the phrase.

centum language /ckentvm/
An Indo-European language in which the velar
stop /k/ of Proto-Indo-European was retained in such words as Latin centum
‘hundred’; opposed to a satem language, where this sound changed to an alve-
olar fricative /s/ in such words as Avestan satem ‘hundred’. Celtic, Romance,
and Germanic languages are among the centum group; Balto-Slavonic and
Indo-Iranian languages are among the satem group.
chain (n.) (1)
In communication studies, a term used to describe a model
which presents the communicative act as an interrelated sequence of stages
between a speaker and a receiver. With reference to speech (the speech chain),
the model usually distinguishes psychological, neurological, physiological and
anatomical stages of sound production, an acoustic stage of transmission,
and anatomical, physiological, neurological and psychological stages of sound
reception.
chain
71

(2)
In government-binding theory, a chain refers to a sequence of syntac-
tic elements subject to the same speciﬁc conditions, as shown by government
and co-indexing: ai
1, ai
2 . . . ai
n, where each a is antecedent-governed. In this
example, ai
1 is the head of the chain, ai
n is the foot or tail; and each adjacent
pair is a link. It represents the history of movement, and retains an important
role in the minimalist programme. A moved constituent and its co-
indexed traces form a chain. A chain is an A-chain if ai
1 is in an A-position,
and an A-bar-chain if it is in an A-bar-position. The principle governing the
linking of chains is called the chain formation principle or chain condition:
every chain created by movement of an argument must contain just one theta-
marked position and just one Case-marked position. Movement of an adjunct
also creates a chain, but does not have theta-marked position or Case-marked
position. A CHAIN is a generalization of the notion to handle expletive–
argument pairs, such as Therei is a cari in the garage.
(3)
In historical phonology, a situation where a series of sound changes take
place, each one inﬂuencing the next. Two directions of movement are possible.
When the process begins at the top or front end of an articulatory dimension,
empty slots are left in the chain which other sounds move up to ﬁll: a drag
chain. When the process begins at the bottom or back end of the chain, each
sound ‘pushes’ the next one out of place: a push chain. The Great Vowel Shift in
English is often cited as a classical example of a chain movement (or chain shift)
in operation.
(4)
In syntax, a term used to describe clause combinations in languages
where the distinction between co-ordination and subordination does not
easily apply. In a clause-chaining language (such as the Papuan language, Hua),
identity or lack of identity between the subjects of successive clauses is marked
by verb inﬂection (see switch reference).
(5)
In sociolinguistics, a continuing sequence of question/answer exchanges
in a conversation; also referred to as chaining.
CHAIN
see chain (2)
chain/choice (n.)
A pair of terms used by some linguists to refer to the two
main axes of linguistic organization, corresponding to the distinction between
syntagmatic (‘chain’) and paradigmatic (‘choice’). This sense of ‘choice’ is
more restricted than that found in some discussions of semantics, where a
widely held conception of meaningfulness is based on the ability of the speaker/
hearer to ‘choose’ from a selection of linguistic alternatives, which provide the
information-carrying contrasts prerequisite for communication.

change from above/below
Two terms introduced into sociolinguistics by
William Labov (b. 1927) as part of the explanation of language change. ‘Change
from below’ refers to the alterations that people make in their speech below the
level of their conscious awareness; ‘change from above’ results from a conscious
process of correction of individual linguistic forms, as a result of social pressure
72
CHAIN

(see hypercorrection). The terms have also been used so as to focus on the
relationships of social class which are implicated. Here, ‘change from below’ is
seen when the speech of people from a higher-class background is inﬂuenced by
that of lower-class speakers – in situations, for example, where the former group
admires the latter’s traditional way of life. ‘Change from above’ involves the
reverse process: lower-class people come to recognize the high prestige attached
to certain pronunciations, which they then introduce into their speech. See also
language change, overt (2).

charm (n.)
In government phonology, a term adapted from particle
physics, and used to refer to a property of the combinatorial possibilities of
the primitive elements which form phonological segments. Segments may be
positively charmed (e.g. vowels) or negatively charmed (e.g. plosives), or they
may be neutral (charmless, e.g. liquids). Charmed segments may govern; charm-
less segments may be governed. Positively charmed segments may not occur in
non-nuclear positions; negatively charmed segments may not occur in nuclear
positions.

chart parser
In computational linguistics, a procedure which builds up a
representation of the constituents present in a sentence during a parsing
operation. A chart is a set of entries, each of which consists of the name of a
terminal or non-terminal symbol, the starting-point of the entry, and the entry
length. The parsing process involves a key list (a stack of entries waiting to be
entered into the chart) and a set of rules (arcs or edges) that apply to the
entries. Each arc represents the application of a rule to build a constituent, and
is labelled with the rule it represents. Several kinds of chart parsers have been
developed in natural language processing, using different programming
languages and procedures (e.g. top-down and bottom-up algorithms).
checked (adj.) (1)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle
(see Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to
handle secondary articulations – in this case, glottalization. Checked con-
sonants are deﬁned, both articulatorily and acoustically, as those sounds pro-
duced with accompanying glottal activity, involving a rapid energy discharge
checked
73

in a short time interval. ejectives and implosives, in this view, are [+checked].
The opposite term is unchecked, which applies to all non-glottalized sounds,
signalled acoustically by a lower energy discharge over a larger time interval.
(2)
The term is also found as an alternative to closed, in the description of
syllables: a checked syllable is one ending in a consonant, and a checked
vowel is a vowel occurring in such a syllable.
checking (adj.) (1)
A term sometimes used in grammatical description to
refer to a subtype of tag questions: a checking tag is one which reverses the
positive or negative value of the main-clause verb, and whose function is seen
as one of conﬁrmation, or ‘checking’, e.g. It’s Sunday today, isn’t it. Other types
of tag would be referred to as ‘copy’ tags.
(2)
In the minimalist programme, a term describing a procedure which de-
termines whether a lexical element has the appropriate features before it is
used in a position in sentence structure. It is a basic relation which allows
one element to license another by checking off the features with which the
latter is associated. The features involved must be in a local domain, called the
checking domain.
chereme (n.)
see cherology
cherology (n.)
In linguistics, a term sometimes used for the study of sign
language. It was coined on analogy with phonology to refer to the study of the
smallest contrastive units (cheremes) which occur in a sign language. Signs are
analysed into such features as the location of the signing space in which a sign
is made, the hand conﬁguration used, and the action of the active hand.
chest pulse
A term used in phonetics to refer to a contraction of those mus-
cles of the chest which are involved in the exhalation of air from the lungs. For
the production of emphatic speech, these pulses are said to be ‘reinforced’ or
‘stressed’. The chest pulse has been suggested as a central explanatory concept in
one account of syllable production (chest pulse theory), but this view presents
several problems.
child-directed speech
In language acquisition, a term used for the whole
range of distinctive linguistic characteristics found in adult speech addressed
to young children. In early studies it was frequently referred to as baby-talk
(a term still widely used in popular parlance), but the notion includes far more
than the often stereotyped use of endearing pronunciations and words (such as
doggie, /den/ for then, etc.) and is primarily characterized with reference to the
use of simpliﬁed sentence structures, and certain types of linguistic inter-
action (such as the expansion of a child’s sentence into a full adult form, e.g.
Dadda gone ⇒ Yes, daddy’s gone). The study of baby-talk, or ‘language input’,
became a major focus of language acquisition studies in the early 1970s, a
particular stimulus coming from sociolinguistics. An early argument of
Chomsky’s was that child-directed speech was highly degenerate in quality
(involving many errors, false starts, etc.), but later research has established a
great deal that is systematic in the input of adults to children. The term is now
uncommon in psycholinguistics because of its apparent restriction to babies
74
checking

(as opposed to young children generally) and its ambiguity (talk by babies as
well as to babies). It was replaced by motherese, and also by more general
notions such as caregiver or caretaker speech, before the present term came to
be widely used.

choice (n.)
see binary feature, chain/choice
choice function
A term used in semantics for a function which maps each
set in its domain onto a member of that set. Choice functions play an important
role in certain semantic analyses of speciﬁc indeﬁnites.
chômeur (n.)
A term used in relational grammar, derived from the French
word meaning ‘unemployed’, to refer to a nominal item which has its role in a
clause taken over (or ‘usurped’) by another nominal; abbreviated as cho. For
example, in a passive sentence, the underlying subject is seen as having its
subject function usurped by the direct object from the active sentence; as a
result, the subject of the active sentence becomes demoted into a chômeur. By
seeing such structures in terms of rules which alter relations (rather than in
terms of a transformation of one phrase-marker into another), it is hoped
that a more universal formulation of such rules will be obtained.
Chomsky-adjunction (n.)
A type of syntactic operation in transformational
grammar, referring to a rule which places certain elements of structure in
adjacent positions, with the aim of specifying how these structures ﬁt together
in larger units. To Chomsky-adjoin elements, a constituent A is adjoined to B
by creating a new B node which immediately dominates both A and B. (See
adjunction for tree diagrams.)
Chomskyan (adj./n.)
Characteristic of, or a follower of, the linguistic principles
of (Avram) Noam Chomsky (b. 1928), now Institute Professor and Professor of
Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; also spelled Chomskian.
His theory of language structure known as transformational-generative
grammar revolutionized work in linguistics in 1957, with the publication
of his monograph Syntactic Structures. Later, major publications on technical
linguistic topics included Current Issues in Linguistic Theory (1964) and
Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965). The latter publication introduced a new
direction into generative theory and became the orthodoxy for several years.
His main publication on phonology was The Sound Pattern of English (1968),
with Morris Halle, referred to in this dictionary as ‘Chomsky and Halle’. Later
developments in his linguistic thinking in book form may be found in Reﬂec-
tions on Language (1976), Rules and Representations (1980), Knowledge of
Language (1986), Barriers (1986) and The Minimalist Program (1995).
By the mid-1960s Chomsky had come to stress the role of language as a key
means to the investigation of the human mind. The view that linguistics can
be proﬁtably seen as a branch of cognitive psychology is argued especially in
Language and Mind (1968), and it is this aspect of his thinking which has
attracted a wide readership outside linguistics, especially among philosophers
Chomskyan
75

and psychologists. A collection of essays since 1992 is New Horizons in the the
Study of Language and Mind (2000). In the 2000s, Chomsky has argued that
his whole generative grammar project is an exercise in biolinguistics: a good
summary is in On Nature and Language (2002).
Chomsky has also been actively involved in politics and has written widely on
US power and involvement (or lack of involvement) in many major conﬂicts
around the world, as well as on issues of propaganda, world trade and global-
ization, e.g. American Power and the New Mandarins (1969), The Fateful Triangle
(1983), Turning the Tide (1985), Proﬁts over People (1998), and 9–11 (2001).
His political activism increased after 11 September 2001.
Chomsky hierarchy
A label applied to the series of increasingly powerful classes
of formal languages which can be generated by formal grammars (as ﬁrst
demonstrated by Noam Chomsky, using notions partly derived from automata
theory). Type 3 grammars are ﬁnite-state grammars (also called ‘right-linear
grammars’); Type 2 grammars are context-free grammars; Type 1 grammars
are context-sensitive grammars; and Type 0 grammars are unrestricted rewrite
grammars. See Chomskyan.
chroneme (n.)
An abstract unit, used by some phonologists as a means of
describing phonologically contrastive differences in the length of speech
sounds. Both vowels and consonants may display phonemic contrasts in
length: long and short vowels are found in German, long and short consonants
in Estonian. The vowel-length differences in English, such as in bit and beat,
also involve differences in quality, and the term chroneme is thus not applic-
able. Those who use this terminology would refer to the etic unit of duration as
a chrone.
chunk (n., v.)
see chunking
chunking (n.)
In psycholinguistics, the breaking up of an utterance into
units (chunks) so that it can be more efﬁciently processed. For example, the
use of prosody to chunk a sequence of digits enables the digits to be remem-
bered more easily (cf. /3, 7, 4, 1, 9, 8, 5, 7, 6, 2/ v. /3, 7, 4, 1, 9 / 8, 5, 7, 6,
2/). The notion has come to be particularly used in relation to the storage and
production of syntactic constructions, especially in relation to the emergentist
approach in ﬁrst-language acquisition. Chunking is also used as a teaching
technique in speech pathology and foreign language teaching.
circonstant (n.)
In valency grammar, a non-essential dependent unit, not
determined by the valency of the verb; opposed to actant. Examples would
include modiﬁers and most uses of adverbials.
circumﬁx (n.)
see afﬁx
circumscription (n.)
In prosodic morphology, a term used to characterize
a core principle of the approach: ‘prosodic circumscription’ asserts that the
domain to which morphological operations apply is deﬁned by prosodic criteria
(as well as by the traditionally recognized morphological criteria). In afﬁxation,
76
Chomsky hierarchy

for example, the operation of assigning a preﬁx to a base is traditionally
carried out on purely grammatical grounds, whereas in prosodic circumscription
the base form is delimited (circumscribed) prosodically. The notion makes it
possible to give an account of such phenomena as the locus of inﬁxation in
prosodic terms. See also template (2).
citation form
The form of a linguistic unit when it is cited in isolation, for
purposes of discussion. More speciﬁcally, the term refers to the pronunciation
given to a word when it is produced in isolation, and not in connected speech.
The term citation is also used in a general sense in linguistics, referring to the
use of an utterance or piece of text for quotation or reference purposes. In
lexicography, citation slips are used to provide the evidence on which the
dictionary’s entries are selected and organized.
clash (v.), clashing (n.)
see metrical grid
class (n.)
An application in linguistics and phonetics of the general use of
this term, to refer to a set of entities sharing certain formal or semantic
properties. Its most widespread use is in relation to the classiﬁcation of mor-
phemes into form-classes and words into word-classes (other syntactic units
being less likely to be referred to in terms of classes). A major distinction is
sometimes drawn between open and closed classes of words. The term class
cleavage is sometimes used where a word is analysable into different classes, e.g.
round in It’s your round, round the corner, etc. Some grammarians refer to
countable nouns as ‘class nouns’.
‘Class’ has a special status in Hallidayan linguistics, where it is one of the
four main categories recognized by that theory (the others being structure,
unit and system). Here, classes are any set of items having the same possibil-
ities of operation in structure, e.g. the class of ‘nominal groups’ can operate as
subject, object, etc., in clause structure.
Classiﬁcation is a feature of structuralist linguistics, where phones were
classiﬁed into phonemes, morphs into morphemes, etc. The perceived limita-
tions of this taxonomic approach to language provided a main argument for
the development of generative linguistics. However, the notion of a natural
class is central to some models of phonology; for example, in feature geo-
metry, features of the same kind are grouped together under class nodes.
class cleavage
see class
class dialect
In sociolinguistics, a term sometimes used to refer to varieties
of language which correlate with divisions of social class – alternatively known
as ‘social dialects’.
classeme (n.)
A term used by some European linguists (e.g. Eugen Coseriu
(1921–2002)), to refer to the relatively abstract semantic features shared by
lexical items belonging to different semantic ﬁelds, e.g. animate/inanimate,
adult/child. In this approach, the term contrasts with the irreducible semantic
features (semes) which work, at a very particular level, within a particular semantic
ﬁeld, e.g. table being identiﬁed in terms of ‘number of legs’, ‘shape’, etc.

classiﬁer (n.) (1) (CL, class)
In grammar, a morpheme whose function is to
indicate the formal or semantic class to which items belong is sometimes
called a classiﬁer, e.g. -ly is an adverb classiﬁer, -ess is a ‘femininity’ classiﬁer.
The marking of lexical items as belonging to the same semantic class is an
important feature of many languages (e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese, Hopi), and
sometimes quite unexpected bases of classiﬁcations are found, in terms of shape,
size, colour, movability, animacy, status, and so on.
(2)
In sign-language studies, a term used for a handshape which functions
pronominally for a class of objects, e.g. ‘vehicle’.
class node
In feature geometry, a term which refers to a non-terminal node,
or ‘organizing’ node.
clausal (adj.)
see clause
clause (n.)
A term used in some models of grammar to refer to a unit of
grammatical organization smaller than the sentence, but larger than phrases,
words or morphemes. The traditional classiﬁcation is of clausal units into
main (independent or superordinate) and subordinate (or dependent) clauses,
e.g. The girl arrived/after the rain started. Some grammars distinguish ﬁnite
and non-ﬁnite types of clause, depending on the form of the verb used, and
further subdivisions are sometimes made (e.g. a reduced ‘verbless’ clause, as
in When ripe, these apples will be lovely). A more detailed subclassiﬁcation
would take into account the function of clauses within the sentence, e.g.
as adverbial, noun or adjective. It would also analyse clauses into formal
elements of structure, such as subject, verb, object, complement and
adverbial.
Derived terms include wh-clauses, such as I wonder when they will leave;
that-clauses, such as They decided that the journey was too far; and small
clauses, a term used in government-binding theory for clauses which con-
tain neither a ﬁnite verb nor an inﬁnitival to, such as I saw [him do it].
Mainstream generative grammar makes no formal distinction between clauses
and sentences: both are symbolized by S/S′ (or equivalents such as IP/CP). Some
grammarians make use of the notion of kernel clause: such a clause forms a
sentence on its own; is structurally complete, not elliptical; is declarative,
not imperative, interrogative or exclamative; is positive, not negative;
and is unmarked with respect to all the thematic systems of the clause. It
should be noted that this is not an alternative term for the early generative
grammar notion of ‘kernel sentence’. See also chain (4), serial verb.
clause-chaining language
see chain (4)
clause-mate (n.)
A term used in early generative grammar to refer to a type
of relationship between the elements of a sentence structure within a phrase-
marker. A and B are clause-mates if and only if the S node that most imme-
diately dominates A is also the S node that most immediately dominates B.
For example, in a tree partially illustrated by:
78
classiﬁcation

click
79
the elements NPi and VPi are clause-mates, as are the elements NPj and VPj; but
NPi is not a clause-mate of VPj. The notion permits a certain economy of
statement in discussing the properties of transformational rules; selectional
restrictions, for example, apply only to clause-mates.
clause-wall (n.)
A term used in non-discrete grammar, to refer to the dif-
ferent degrees of dependency existing between clauses. Clauses which have a
relatively high clause-wall between them are more independent than those which
are separated by a relatively low clause-wall.
clear l
An impressionistic but commonly used term for a variety of lateral
sounds where the resonance is that of a front vowel of an [i] quality, as in the
standard pronunciation of /l/ before vowels and /j/ in English, e.g. leap, lamp. It
is opposed to dark l.
cleavage (n.)
see class
cleft sentence
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a con-
struction where a single clause has been divided into two separate sections,
each with its own verb, one of which appears in a dependent wh-clause (rela-
tive clause). For example, the sentence Mary is driving a new car can be ‘cleft’
in various ways, e.g. It’s Mary who is driving a new car, It’s a new car that
Mary is driving. The variants affect the distribution of emphasis within the
sentence, and correlate closely with patterns of intonational prominence.
Cleft sentences, and the associated pseudo-cleft sentences, have attracted
particular attention in transformational grammar, because of the deriva-
tional problems they pose.
click (n.) (1)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on the
basis of their manner of articulation: it is a shorthand way of referring to
the series of sounds produced by using the velaric airstream mechanism (see
velar). In English, click sounds may be heard in the ‘tut tut’ sound of dis-
approval, in some types of kiss, and in the noise used to signal appreciation or
to ‘gee up’ horses. In some languages (e.g. Zulu, Xhosa), clicks have phonemic
status. The range of clicks includes bilabial [ê], dental [|] formerly [d], alveolar

[!] formerly [t], and lateral [||] formerly [™]. coarticulations with clicks are
called click accompaniments.
(2)
In early psycholinguistic experiments on speech perception and com-
prehension, a click refers to a burst of acoustic noise introduced extrane-
ously into one ear while the listener attends to speech in the other. For example,
it was thought that by varying the position of the click in relation to the
grammatical structure of the speech, information could be gained concern-
ing the way in which grammatical units are perceived and organized by the
brain. The experiments were generally inconclusive and are rarely cited as
evidence today.
cline (n.)
A term used in Hallidayan linguistics to refer to a continuum of
potentially inﬁnite gradation, e.g. the range of possible contrasts between fall-
ing and rising pitch levels, or the degrees of contrast capable of being drawn
along a time scale. Since its original use in scale-and-category grammar, the
term has come to be used in other ﬁelds than linguistics, often unnecessarily, as
a synonym for ‘continuum’.
clinical linguistics
The application of linguistic theories, methods and descript-
ive ﬁndings to the analysis of medical conditions or settings involving a disorder
(or pathology) of language. This application involves the linguist working in
collaboration with speech pathologists/therapists, audiologists and others in
helping to assess, diagnose and remediate disorders of the production and
comprehension of spoken or written language – disorders which may of course
occur in educational as well as clinical settings. The relevance of psycho-
linguistics, neurolinguistics and language acquisition studies to this end
is noteworthy. See also language pathology.
clipped form

clipping (n.)
see abbreviation
clitic (n.)
A term used in grammar to refer to a form which resembles a
word, but which cannot stand on its own as a normal utterance, being phono-
logically dependent upon a neighbouring word (its host) in a construction.
(The term ‘clitic’ comes from the Greek word for ‘leaning’.) Examples of cliticized
forms are the contracted forms of be, such as I’m and he’s. The articles of
English, French, etc., are sometimes referred to as clitics: a form like the cannot
stand on its own in normal utterance, but it would be called a word none the
less by native-speakers. Such clitic words (‘clitics’) can be classiﬁed into proclitics
(i.e. they depend upon a following word, as in the case of the articles) and enclitics
(i.e. they depend upon a preceding word, as in the attachment (cliticization) of
some pronouns to the end of a verb form in Italian or Spanish). The processes
are also referred to as proclisis and enclisis respectively. Clitic-climbing occurs
when a clitic moves from its local domain to a higher constituent, as in Italian
Maria lo vuole vedere (‘Maria wants to see him’), where the lo has moved from
the inﬁnitive to before the ﬁrst verb. Clitic-doubling occurs when a clitic is used
despite the existence of an element with the same meaning and function in the
same clause, as in Spanish Maria me visito a mi (‘Maria visited me’).

close (adj.) (1)
A term used in the four-level classiﬁcation of vertical tongue
movement in vowel sounds based on the cardinal vowel system, the others
being ‘half-close’, ‘half-open’ and ‘open’. It refers to a vowel made with the
tongue in the highest position possible without causing audible friction, as
in the articulation of [i] and [u]: the closest vowels in English are in words
like seat and shoot. The area of articulation immediately below ‘close’ is
known as half-close or mid-close, as in [e] and [o] (the nearest sounds in English
are in words like say and so respectively). In a three-level classiﬁcation of
vowel sounds, the highest group are known as ‘high’ vowels (as opposed to
‘low’ and ‘mid’).
(2)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of types of juncture or transition,
referring to the normal transitions operating between the sounds in a word.
Close juncture is opposed to ‘open’ or ‘plus’ juncture; close transition to ‘open
transition’.
(3)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of types of jaw setting, referring to a jaw
position in which the teeth are brought closer together than normal; opposed to
‘open’ jaw settings.
closed (adj.) (1)
A term sometimes used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of
words to refer to one of two postulated major word-classes in language, the
other being open. A closed class is one whose membership is ﬁxed or limited.
New items are not regularly added, as is the case with ‘open-class’ items.
pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, articles, etc., are all closed class or
closed system items, the term ‘system’ here reﬂecting the fact that the member-
ship of such classes is ﬁnite, the members displaying an interdependence of
meaning and use.
(2)
A term used in the two-way classiﬁcation of syllable structure, referring
to a syllable ending in a consonant; its opposite is open, where the syllable
ends in a vowel. This feature is sometimes referred to as a checked or blocked
syllable.
closure (n.)
A general term used in phonetics to refer to an articulation
where the contact between active and passive articulators obstructs the airstream
through the mouth and/or nose. A ‘complete closure’ exists in the case of
plosives, affricates and nasals, and in the glottalic and velaric airstream
mechanisms. An ‘intermittent closure’ exists in the case of rolls, ﬂaps and
taps. A ‘partial closure’ exists in the case of laterals. Some phoneticians
would include fricatives under the heading of ‘partial’ or ‘incomplete’ closure.
A narrowing of the vocal tract where there is no articulatory contact is
usually called a stricture.
cluster (n.)
A term used in the analysis of connected speech to refer to any
sequence of adjacent consonants, especially those occurring initially or
ﬁnally in a syllable, such as the initial [br-] of bread, or the ﬁnal [-st] of best.
Not all possible combinations of consonants occur in a language. Initially
cluster
81

in syllables in English, for example, clusters are not possible with [¨], [ Ä], [u]
or [z]. Up to three consonants can occur initially, as in [spr-], [spl-], [skw-]; up
to four can occur ﬁnally, as in glimpsed [-mpst] and twelfths [-lfθs]. See also
reduce.
coalesce (v.)
see coalescence
coalescence (n.)
A term used in linguistics, especially in historical studies,
to refer to the coming together of linguistic units which were originally distin-
guishable. allophones of a phoneme may coalesce, as may different phonemes
and different morphemes. Many cases of Modern English /è/, for example,
are the result of coalescence of /z/ and /j/, e.g. occasion, measure; in words
like formation, one could analyse the afﬁx as a coalescence of the morphemes
-ate + -tion. Analogous terms include syncretism, merger, fusion and
neutralization.
coalescent (adj.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology as part of the
classiﬁcation of types of assimilation. In coalescent (or ‘reciprocal’) assimila-
tion, each of two adjacent articulations inﬂuences the other. An example is
the fusion of [d] and [j] to produce [u] in such phrases as could you.
coarticulation (n.)
An articulation which involves in a simultaneous or over-
lapping way more than one point in the vocal tract, as in the co-ordinate
stops [i], [ ≈
bì], [j] and [ ≈
bd] often heard in West African languages. In an-
ticipatory coarticulation, an articulator not involved in a particular sound
begins to move in the direction of an articulation needed for a later sound in
the utterance (its target). An example is the sh- of shoe, which is normally
pronounced with lip-rounding, anticipating the inﬂuence of the following [up].
In perseverative or perseveratory coarticulation, a sound retains a characteristic
deriving from an earlier articulation, as when the [n] in seen is articulated
slightly further forward than the [n] in soon. Alternative terms include right-to-
left (for anticipatory) and left-to-right (for perseverative) coarticulation. See also
anticipatory (2).
cocktail party phenomenon
An everyday effect studied scientiﬁcally in psycho-
linguistics as part of a theory of speech perception. It refers to the process
of selective listening, whereby people hearing several conversations at once
are able to attend consciously to one of them, and to ignore the others.
coda (n.) (Co)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to the
portion of a syllable which may follow the syllabic nucleus, e.g. the /p/ of
/kÎp/ ‘cup’. A distinction is sometimes drawn between ‘simple’ syllabic codas
(containing only one segment) and ‘complex’ codas (containing more than one
segment). Restrictions on the segments or features which may occur in coda
position are known as coda constraints. Derived forms include NOCODA, used in
optimality theory for a syllable ending in a vowel.
code (n.)
The general sense of this term – a set of conventions for converting
one signalling system into another – enters into the subject-matter of semiotics
82
coalesce

and communication theory rather than linguistics. Such notions as ‘encod-
ing’ and ‘decoding’ are sometimes encountered in phonetics and linguistics,
but the view of language as a ‘code’ is not one which ﬁgures greatly in these
subjects. The term has come to the fore in sociolinguistics, where it is mainly
used as a neutral label for any system of communication involving language –
and which avoids sociolinguists having to commit themselves to such terms as
dialect, language or variety, which have a special status in their theories.
The linguistic behaviour referred to as code-switching (sometimes code-shifting
or, within a language, style-shifting), for example, can be illustrated by the
switch bilingual or bidialectal speakers may make (depending on who they
are talking to, or where they are) between standard and regional forms of
English, between Welsh and English in parts of Wales, or between occupational
and domestic varieties. Code-mixing involves the transfer of linguistic elements
from one language into another: a sentence begins in one language, then makes
use of words or grammatical features belonging to another. Such mixed forms
of language are often labelled with a hybrid name, such as (in the case of
English) Spanglish, Franglais and Singlish (Singaporean English), and attract
attitudes ranging from enthusiastic community support (as an expression of
local identity) to outright condemnation (from some speakers of the related
standard languages).
Several sociologists and sociolinguists have given ‘code’ a more restricted deﬁni-
tion. For example, codes are sometimes deﬁned in terms of mutual intelligibility
(e.g. the language of a private or professional group). But the most widespread
special use of the term was in the theory of communication codes propounded
by the British sociologist Basil Bernstein (1924–2000). His distinction between
elaborated and restricted codes was part of a theory of the nature of social
systems, concerned in particular with the kinds of meanings people commun-
icate, and how explicitly they do this, using the range of resources provided by
the language.

codiﬁcation (n.)
A term used in language planning (corpus planning), refer-
ring to the compilation of a systematic statement of the rules and conventions
governing the use of a language variety, typically the standard language of a
community. When a language has been codiﬁed, its products include spelling
and pronunciation guides, grammars, dictionaries, style manuals, and guides to
correct usage.
codify (v.)
see codiﬁcation
cognate (adj./n.) (1)
A language or a linguistic form which is historically
derived from the same source as another language/form, e.g. Spanish/Italian/
French/Portuguese are ‘cognate languages’ (or ‘cognates’); père/padre, etc.
(‘father’) are ‘cognate words’ or cognates.
(2)
The term is also applied to the description of some kinds of syntactic
relations: a ‘cognate object’ is one which has the same historical derivation
as the verb which governs it (or, more loosely, is semantically dependent
upon the action of the verb), e.g. to run a race, live a good life, ask a question;
cognate
83

a cognate subject–verb–object sequence is illustrated by such sentences as
Employers employ employees.
cognise (v.)
see cognize
cognitive (adj.)
A term sometimes used in semantics as part of a classiﬁcation
of types of meaning. Cognitive meaning refers to those aspects of meaning
which relate directly to denotations of lexical items and the propositional
content of sentences, and thus corresponds to an intellectually objective level
of interpretation, as opposed to one where emotional or subjective interpretation
is involved. Alternative terms include denotative and referential; opposite
terms include emotive and connotative.
cognitive domain
see cognitive semantics
cognitive grammar
A linguistic theory which sees language as an integral
part of cognition, a means whereby cognitive content is given structure; origin-
ally called space grammar. In this approach, the basic function of language is
to symbolize conceptualization by means of phonology. grammar is seen as
an inherently meaningful (or ‘symbolic’) component of the theory, linking
semantics (viewed in conceptualist terms) and phonology. This pairing of forms
and meanings sets up connections between established (‘entrenched’) patterns
of neurological activity (‘units’), which serve as templates for categorizing
expressions. Each unit (semantic, phonological, symbolic) corresponds to an
aspect of structure, and well-formed expressions are ‘conventionally’ con-
structed using a series of units. Grammatical classes and constructions are
analysed as conﬁgurations of symbolic structures: a basic distinction is drawn
between ‘nominals’ (things, e.g. noun phrases) and ‘relational expressions’
(relationships, e.g. verbs, prepositions, adjectives, clauses); grammatical
rules are characterized as abstract ‘constructional schemas’. See also cogni-
tive semantics.
cognitive metaphor
see conceptual metaphor
cognitive semantics
A semantic theory, part of cognitive grammar, which
identiﬁes meaning with conceptualization – the structures and processes which
are part of mental experience. The theory stresses the importance of bodily
experience in concepualization. It operates with an encyclopedic view of mean-
ing, not recognizing a clear boundary between linguistic and general knowledge.
lexical items, which act as pointers or triggers for encyclopedic knowledge,
are therefore typically polysemous, and analysed as a network of related senses.
The theory identiﬁes a number of processes such as metaphor and metonymy
as general cognitive processes rather than purely linguistic devices. A central
notion is how a conceptual content is ‘construed’: the construal of a lexical item
depends on several factors, including the ‘cognitive domains’ in which it appears
(e.g. space, time, colour) and variations in perspective and salience.
cognitivism (n.)
In language acquisition, the view that cognitive factors
(e.g. intelligence, memory, attention) have a primary role in language learning.
See Geneva School (2), innateness.

cognise

cognize/cognise (v.)
A term suggested by Noam Chomsky as an alternative to
‘know’. Speakers are said to cognize not only the linguistic facts which they
consciously know (e.g. that a particular sentence has a particular interpreta-
tion), but also the mentally represented rules from which these facts derive and
the innate principles underlying these rules.
co-grammar (n.)
In linguistics, a term referring to a system of expression
which coexists with, and is different from, the main grammar of a language; a
corresponding notion in phonology is co-phonology. Such notions are often
used when describing the distinctive behaviour of foreign words and phrases
that have been borrowed by a language but not adapted to its regular system.
coherence (n.)
An application of the general use of this term in discourse
analysis, referring to the main principle of organization postulated to account for
the underlying functional connectedness or identity of a piece of spoken or
written language (text, discourse). It involves the study of such factors as the
language users’ knowledge of the world, the inferences they make, and the
assumptions they hold, and in particular of the way in which coherent commu-
nication is mediated through the use of speech acts. In this context, coherence
is usually contrasted with cohesion, which refers to the syntactic or seman-
tic connectivity of linguistic forms at a surface-structure level of analysis.
cohesion (n.) (1)
A term often used in grammar to refer to a deﬁning property
of the word, seen as a grammatical unit; also called cohesiveness. The criterion
states that new elements cannot usually be inserted into words in normal
speech, but only at word boundaries. An alternative name for this criterion is
‘uninterruptibility’. The criterion works well for English (apart from such examples
as abso-blooming-lutely), but has to be modiﬁed if applied to languages where
inﬁxes are used.
(2)
The term is used by some linguists to refer to the property of larger units
than the morpheme to bind together in constructions, e.g. article + noun.
In this use, any group of words which acts as a constituent of a larger unit can
be said to be internally cohesive. In the hallidayan approach to grammatical
analysis, cohesion is a major concept, referring to those surface-structure
features of an utterance or text which link different parts of sentences or
larger units of discourse, e.g. the cross-referencing function of pronouns,
articles and some types of adverb (as in The man went to town. However, he
did not stay long . . . ). A distinction is usually drawn with the notion of a text’s
underlying coherence.
cohesiveness (n.)
see cohesion
co-hyponym (n.)
see hyponymy
co-indexing (n.)
A term used in generative linguistic theory to refer to the
process of assigning the same subscript letter (generally starting with i, j . . .) or
numeral to a series of constituents; superscripts are sometimes used. In par-
ticular, these numerals mark the identity of constituents in the deep structure
of a sentence. Co-indexed elements are intended to be co-referential or be
co-indexing
85

elements belonging to the same chain, as in Hei saw himselfi or Hei was
murdered ti (where ti is a trace of hei).
collapse (v.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to the notational
conﬂation of two rules into one, in the interests of a simpler and more general
statement, e.g. NP ⇒ D N and NP ⇒ D Adj N, being replaced by NP ⇒
D(Adj)N, where the brackets refer to the optional use of the adjective.
collective (adj.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a noun
which denotes a group of entities, and which is formally differentiated from
other nouns by a distinct pattern of number contrast (and, in some languages,
morphologically). Collective nouns (e.g. government, army, club, jury, pub-
lic) fall into several grammatical subclasses, but their distinctive characteristic is
their ability to co-occur in the singular with either a singular or a plural verb,
this correlating with a difference of interpretation – the noun being seen as a
single collective entity, or as a collection of individual entities (cf. the committee
is wrong v. the committee are wrong). In some languages, ‘collective’ (v. non-
collective) refers to a type of plural formation in which a number of individuals
is seen as forming a coherent set; for example, a plural sufﬁx A attached to
house might express the notion of a ‘village’ (collective), whereas sufﬁx B might
refer to any random group of houses (non-collective). In semantics, the term is
often used for predicates or quantiﬁers which ascribe a property to a group
as a whole, as opposed to the individual members of the group; it contrasts with
distributive. For example, congregate is a collective predicate: The children
congregated in the hallway means that the group as a whole congregated; an
individual child cannot congregate.
colligation (n.)
A term in Firthian linguistics for the process or result of
grouping a set of words on the basis of their similarity in entering into
syntagmatic grammatical relations. For example, a set of verbs which
take a certain kind of complement construction would be said to be ‘in
colligation with’ that construction; e.g. agree, choose, decline, manage, etc.
colligate with to+inﬁnitive constructions, as opposed to -ing forms, as I agree to
go v. *I agree going. Colligation is usually contrasted with collocation.
collocability (n.)
see collocation
collocation (n.)
A term used in lexicology by some (especially Firthian)
linguists to refer to the habitual co-occurrence of individual lexical items.
For example, auspicious collocates with occasion, event, sign, etc.; and letter
collocates with alphabet, graphic, etc., on the one hand, and postman, pillar-
box, etc., on the other. Collocations are, then, a type of syntagmatic lexical
relation. They are linguistically predictable to a greater or lesser extent (e.g. the
bond between spick and span is stronger than that between letter and pillar-
box), and this differentiates them from sense associations, which tend to
include idiosyncratic connections (e.g. mother-in-law associating with hippo-
potamus). Some words have no speciﬁc collocational restrictions – grammatical
words such as the, of, after, in. By contrast, there are many totally predictable
restrictions, as in eke + out, spick + span, and these are usually analysed as
86
collapse

idioms, clichés, etc. Another important feature of collocations is that they are
formal (not semantic) statements of co-occurrence; e.g. green collocates with
jealousy (as opposed to, say, blue or red), even though there is no referential
basis for the link. Lexical items which are ‘collocated’ are said to be collocates
of each other; the potential of items to collocate is known as their collocability
or collocational range. A related notion is ‘semantic prosody’ (see semantics).
Collocational restrictions are analogous to the notion of selectional restric-
tions in generative grammar. Collocations should not be confused with the
notion of word association in psychology, which refers to any kind of mental
relationship between words – for example, car might produce the association
New Zealand or Uncle Joe. Word associations of this kind are being increas-
ingly studied as part of psycholinguistics, especially for the light they throw
on cultural differences (e.g. in relation to bilingualism). See also paradig-
matic, syntagmatic.
colouring (n.)
In phonetics, a perceived slight change in the quality
(‘colour’) of a vowel sound due to the inﬂuence of some nearby sound. For
example, ‘r-colouring’ occurs when a vowel is affected by the resonance of
a following r-type sound, most noticeably a retroﬂex; a following /h/ can
cause ‘h-colouring’.
combination (n.)
see combinatorial
combinatorial (adj.)
A fundamental function of linguistic units to ‘combine’
with one another to produce more complex patterns. The ‘combinatorial proper-
ties’ or ‘relations’ of consonants and vowels, for example, can be used as a
deﬁnition of syllable (vowel as nucleus, consonants as margins). Combination,
in this sense, is a syntagmatic relation, and opposed to the paradigmatic
notion of contrast.
comitative (adj./n.)
In languages which express grammatical relationships by
means of inﬂections, this term refers to the form taken by a noun phrase
(often a single noun or pronoun) when it is expressing the meaning ‘along
with’ or ‘accompanied by’. A comitative case (‘the comitative’) occurs in Basque,
for example, equivalent in English to the with-phrase seen in I went with my
friend.
command (n./v.) (1)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of sentence functions,
and deﬁned sometimes on grammatical and sometimes on semantic or socio-
linguistic grounds. syntactically a command is a sentence which typically
has no subject, and where the verb is in the imperative mood, e.g. Come
here! Semantically it is primarily used to tell someone to do (or not do) some-
thing. From a speech act point of view, the function of command may be
expressed using other forms, e.g. that boy will stand up, or by a dominant
intonation. The term is usually contrasted with three other major sentence
functions: statement, question, exclamation. In grammatical discussion,
commands are usually referred to as ‘imperative’ in form.
(2)
In generative grammar, the term is used to express the structural rela-
tions that hold between two elements in a tree. There are several uses of the
command
87

term ‘command’, but of particular importance are constituent-command, invari-
ably abbreviated to c-command, and maximal-command, invariably abbreviated
to m-command. Canonically, a node A c-commands another node B if and only
if the ﬁrst branching node that dominates A also dominates B, and A does not
dominate B. A node A m-commands another node B if and only if the ﬁrst
maximal projection which dominates A also dominates B. Thus, in the tree
88
comment
N m-commands Det although it does not c-command it. In the tree
V does not m-command N″ although it c-commands it. C-commanding is an
important notion in the explication of government.
comment (n.)
A term used in semantics and grammar as part of an altern-
ative binary characterization of sentence structure to that traditionally found
in the subject/predicate distinction; the opposite term is topic. The topic
of a sentence is the person or thing about which something is said, whereas
the comment is that part of the sentence which says something further about the
topic. In the sentence The book was on the table, the book is the topic, and
the remainder of the sentence is the comment. English does not mark this
distinction as clearly as some languages, where grammatical particles, word-
order contrasts or inﬂections may help to show the contrast. An analogous
distinction is made using the terms theme and rheme, by some linguists.
comment clause
A type of clause recognized in Quirk grammar, referring to
an optional structure whose function is to add a parenthetic comment to another
clause. There is a wide range of comment clauses in English, e.g. you know, to
be honest, they say, generally speaking. Several of these act as stereotyped
conversation ﬁllers, with several complex functions, e.g. you see, mind you, I see.
commissive (adj./n.)
A term used in the theory of speech acts to refer to a
type of utterance where the speaker makes a commitment to a future course
of action. Commissive utterances (or ‘commissives’) are seen in I promise/I
guarantee. . . .

common (adj.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to the unmar-
ked morphological form of a grammatical category. In English, for example,
the form of the noun other than the genitive could be called the ‘common case’
form. Similarly, one might use ‘common gender’ in a language where only one
contrast is made (e.g. feminine v. masculine/neuter, etc.), or where sex is indeter-
minate out of context (as in French enfant, ‘child’). In traditional grammar,
‘common nouns’ were a semantically deﬁned subclass of nouns (referring to
‘general concepts’) contrasted with proper nouns (names of individuals, etc.);
linguistic approaches tend to emphasize the formal distinctions that can be
made between such subclasses (e.g. different patterns of article usage).
common core
A term used in some sociolinguistic and stylistic studies,
referring to the range of linguistic features found in all varieties, dialects,
etc., of a language. Common core features of a language would include its basic
rules of word-order and word-formation, and its high-frequency vocabu-
lary. A usage such as thou in English, for example, would not be part of the
English common core, as it is restricted to certain dialects and religious con-
texts. However, it is by no means clear just how many features in a language
can be legitimately called ‘common’ in this way, and the notion is especially
difﬁcult to apply in relation to certain areas, such as the vowel system.
common ground
A term used in pragmatics for the set of propositions
assumed by participants in a discourse to be held by the other participants as
uncontroversially true. It is their perceived shared background knowledge.
communication (n.)
A fundamental notion in the study of behaviour, which
acts as a frame of reference for linguistic and phonetic studies. Communica-
tion refers to the transmission and reception of information (a ‘message’)
between a source and a receiver using a signalling system: in linguistic contexts,
source and receiver are interpreted in human terms, the system involved is a
language, and the notion of response to (or acknowledgement of) the message
becomes of crucial importance. In theory, communication is said to have taken
place if the information received is the same as that sent: in practice, one has to
allow for all kinds of interfering factors, or ‘noise’, which reduce the efﬁciency
of the transmission (e.g. unintelligibility of articulation, idiosyncratic asso-
ciations of words). One has also to allow for different levels of control in the
transmission of the message: speakers’ purposive selection of signals will be
accompanied by signals which communicate ‘despite themselves’, as when voice
quality signals the fact that a person has a cold, is tired/old/male, etc. The
scientiﬁc study of all aspects of communication is sometimes called communica-
tion science: the domain includes linguistics and phonetics, their various branches,
and relevant applications of associated subjects (e.g. acoustics, anatomy).
Human communication may take place using any of the available sensory
modes (hearing, sight, etc.), and the differential study of these modes, as used
in communicative activity, is carried on by semiotics. A contrast which is
often made, especially by psychologists, is between verbal and non-verbal com-
munication (NVC) to refer to the linguistic v. the non-linguistic features of
communication (the latter including facial expressions, gestures, etc., both in
humans and animals). However, the ambiguity of the term ‘verbal’ here, implying
communication
89

that language is basically a matter of ‘words’, makes this term of limited value
to linguists, and it is not usually used by them in this way.
communication science
The scientiﬁc study of all aspects of communication;
sometimes referred to as the communication sciences. The domain includes
linguistics and phonetics, their various branches (e.g. psycholinguistics,
sociolinguistics), and relevant applications of associated subjects (e.g. acous-
tics, anatomy, neurology). All modes of communication are involved – spoken,
written and signed.
communicative (adj.)
A term derived from communication, but often used
in a restricted sense. In the phrase communicative competence, for instance, it
is in contrast with ‘linguistic’, a distinction being made between the native-
speakers’ awareness of the formal patterning of their language, on the one
hand (their ‘linguistic competence’), and of the situational appropriateness
of their language, on the other. This emphasis on functional appropriate-
ness also characterizes several uses of the term in the ﬁeld of foreign-language
teaching (communicative grammar, communicative syllabus, etc.). See also
competence.
communicative dynamism (CD)
A fundamental concept of the Prague School
theory of linguistics (see functional sentence perspective), whereby an
utterance is seen as a process of gradually unfolding meaning, each part of
the utterance contributing variously (‘dynamically’) to the total communicative
effect. Some parts of an utterance will contribute little to the meaning, because
they reﬂect only what has already been communicated: these ‘thematic’ aspects
would be considered to have the lowest degree of CD. By contrast, ‘rhematic’
aspects have the highest degree of CD, containing new information which advances
the communicative process. Other aspects are also recognized.
commutation (n.)
A term used by some phonologists to refer to a process of
sound substitution to show contrastivity. It is especially encountered in the
phrase commutation test, which is a systematic use of the substitutability tech-
nique of minimal pairs for establishing phonemes. Some linguistic theories
have used the term in a more restricted sense: in glossematics, for example, it
is contrasted with ‘substitution’, and refers only to one type of relationship
between the members of a paradigm.
comp
An abbreviation for compact, complement and comparative;
also, in generative linguistics, as Comp or COMP, an abbreviation for
complementizer.
compact (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle (see
Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to handle
variations in place of articulation, its opposite being diffuse. Compact
sounds are deﬁned articulatorily and acoustically, as those which involve a
stricture relatively far forward in the mouth, and a relatively high concentra-
tion of acoustic energy in a narrow, central part of the sound spectrum. For
example, open vowels are [+compact] (abbreviated as [+comp]); high or mid
90
communication science

vowels are [−compact] ([−comp]). The feature is replaced by low in Chomsky
and Halle’s system (see Chomskyan).
comparative (adj.) (1)
A term used to characterize a major branch of linguis-
tics, in which the primary concern is to make statements comparing the charac-
teristics of different languages (dialects, varieties, etc.), or different historical
states of a language. During the nineteenth century, the concern for comparative
analysis was exclusively historical, as scholars investigated the relationships
between such families of languages as Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, their hypothetical
antecedents (i.e. the proto-language from which such families developed), and
the subsequent processes which led to the formation of the language groups of
the present day. This study became known as comparative philology (or simply
philology) – sometimes as comparative grammar. The phrase comparative
method refers to the standard comparative philological technique of comparing
a set of forms taken from cognate languages in order to determine whether a
historical relationship connects them. If there were such a relationship, this
analysis would then be used to deduce the characteristics of the ancestor lan-
guage from which they were assumed to have derived (a process of ‘comparative’
or ‘internal’ reconstruction).
Early twentieth-century linguistics switched from a diachronic to a syn-
chronic emphasis in language analysis, and, while not excluding historical studies,
comparative linguistics these days is generally taken up with the theoretical and
practical analysis of the structural correspondences between living languages,
regardless of their history, with the aim of establishing general types of language
(‘typological comparison’, or ‘typological linguistics’) and ultimately the uni-
versal characteristics of human language.
(2)
A term used in the three-way grammatical description of adjectives and
adverbs into degrees (comparison), specifying the extent of their application;
often abbreviated as comp. The comparative form is used for a comparison
between two entities, and contrasts with superlative, for more than two, and
positive, where no comparison is implied. In English, there is both an inﬂec-
tion (-er) and a periphrastic construction (more) to express this notion
(e.g. nicer, more beautiful). The construction which may follow the use of a
comparative is called a comparative clause or comparative sentence, e.g. He is
bigger than I am.

compensatory lengthening
In phonology, an effect in which the deletion
of one segment is accompanied by an increase in the length of another,
usually adjacent to it, thus preserving syllable weight. Typically, a vowel is
compensatory lengthening
91

lengthened when a syllable-ﬁnal segment is lost, as in Old English g4s ‘goose’,
which comes from Germanic gans through the loss of the nasal and the length-
ening of the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is of importance in phonological
theories which recognize the role of syllabic weight (such as autosegmental
phonology).
competence (n.)
A term used in linguistic theory, and especially in generative
grammar, to refer to speakers’ knowledge of their language, the system of
rules which they have mastered so that they are able to produce and under-
stand an indeﬁnite number of sentences, and to recognize grammatical
mistakes and ambiguities. It is an idealized conception of language, which is
seen as in opposition to the notion of performance, the speciﬁc utterances of
speech; the Saussurean distinction between langue and parole is similar, but
there are important differences between the deﬁnitions of competence and langue.
According to Noam Chomsky (see Chomskyan), linguistics before generative
grammar had been preoccupied with performance in a corpus, instead of with
the underlying competence involved. As a general conception, this distinction
has been widely accepted, but there has been criticism from linguists who feel
that the boundary between the two notions is not as clear-cut as their deﬁnitions
would lead one to believe. There are problems, often, in deciding whether a
particular speech feature is a matter of competence or performance (e.g. a feature
of intonation, or discourse).
A particularly strong line of criticism emerged in the notion of communicative
competence, which focuses on the native-speakers’ ability to produce and
understand sentences which are appropriate to the context in which they occur
– what speakers need to know in order to communicate effectively in socially
distinct settings. Communicative competence, then, subsumes the social deter-
minants of linguistic behaviour, including such environmental matters as the
relationship between speaker and hearer, and the pressures which stem from the
time and place of speaking. If speakers have a tacit awareness of such com-
municative constraints, it is argued, then a linguistic theory ought to aim to
provide an explicit account of these factors, in so far as these are systematic
within a community, and not restrict itself to the analysis of structure in
purely formal terms (as in the notion of ‘linguistic’ competence). This view has
received a wide measure of acceptance, but to date relatively little progress
has been made over the question of how to model this broader conception of
competence in precise terms. More recently, an analogous notion of pragmatic
competence has been proposed. See also grammar (5), pragmatics.
complement (n.) (comp)
A term used in the analysis of grammatical func-
tion, to refer to a major constituent of sentence or clause structure,
traditionally associated with ‘completing’ the action speciﬁed by the verb. In its
broadest sense, complement therefore is a very general notion, subsuming all
obligatory features of the predicate other than the verb, e.g. objects (e.g.
She kicked the ball) and adverbials (e.g. She was in the garden). In some
approaches, the complement is given a more restricted deﬁnition, e.g. to refer
only to the ‘completing’ function of structures following the verb to be (or
similar verbs) – in such an analysis, She saw the doctor would be subject–
Verb–Object, whereas She is a doctor would be Subject–Verb–Complement. A
92
competence

further distinction is sometimes made between complements of the subject and
those of the object, as in She is a doctor (subject complement) and She called me
a fool (object complement). Complement clauses of various kinds are recog-
nized, this notion sometimes being interpreted as any kind of subordinate
clause, sometimes as only one type of subordinate clause (e.g. a clause following
be, such as That is what I said). However, the domain of complementation
remains an unclear area in linguistic analysis, and there are several unresolved
issues, e.g. whether the particles in phrasal verbs (e.g. come in) should
be subsumed under this heading. In generative grammar, a complement is a
sister constituent of a zero-level category. Categories other than the verb are
also sometimes said to take complements, e.g. in a student of physics, of physics
is said to be the complement of student. In X-bar syntax, the term is used in
opposition to adjunct (cf. a student with long hair). See also wh-.
complementarity (n.)
see complementary (2)
complementary (adj.) (1)
A term used primarily in phonology in the phrase
complementary distribution, referring to the mutual exclusiveness of a pair of
sounds in a certain phonetic environment. In English, for example, the voice-
less allophone of the /l/ phoneme occurs after initial /p-/, as in plan, and the
voiced allophone is excluded; conversely, [l] is used initially when no /p-/
precedes. [$] and [l] are thus said to be ‘in complementary distribution’ in this
environment. The term is also used analogously in morphology, with reference
to the distribution of pairs of forms in grammatical environments (e.g. the
selection of alternative forms of plural morpheme in English).
(2)
In semantics, the term is often used to refer to a category of sense
relation between lexical items. Complementary terms (or complementaries)
display a type of oppositeness of meaning, illustrated by such pairs as single/
married and boy/girl. Single is said to be ‘the complementary of’ married, and
vice versa. In such a relationship, the assertion of one of the items implies the
denial of the other: an entity cannot be both at once. The relationship of
complementarity is characterized by the lack of any gradability between the
items (there is no continuum of gradation between boy and girl, such that one
can be *less boy, *very boy, and so on). In this respect, the term contrasts with
the technical sense of antonymy, where gradations between the opposites are
possible (cf. big, bigger, very big, etc. v. small, smaller, etc.), and also with
converseness, where the opposites presuppose each other (e.g. husband/wife).
The term contradictory is an alternative preferred by some analysts.
complementizer (n.) (Comp, COMP, C)
In generative syntax, a term used
to refer to subordinating conjunctions which mark an embedded sentence
of a complement type, e.g. that in I said that he was leaving. It is also used,
in X-bar syntax, to refer to a position in clause (S′) structure, symbolized
by COMP or C, which may be ﬁlled (for example) by a complementizer or
by a clause-initial wh-phrase. In government-binding theory, COMP (or C)
is a zero-level category whose maximal projection C″ (or CP) is, like
the initial symbol, the highest-level grammatical construction. Within this
approach, WH-movement, for example, is a movement to the speciﬁer-of-C
position.

*complex (adj.)
In optimality theory, a constraint which penalizes syll-
ables which have more than a single consonant at an edge. The use of
the asterisk reﬂects a negative emphasis: complex onsets and codas are not
acceptable.
complexity (n.)
The general sense of this term is found in linguistics, with
reference to both the formal internal structuring of linguistic units and the
psychological difﬁculty in using or learning them. The factors which contribute
to the notion of complexity are a major topic in psycholinguistics, in studies
of both adult comprehension and production, and of child language acqui-
sition. A central theme is the nature of the interaction between levels of difﬁ-
culty in cognitive and linguistic structures, and especially the way this affects
the order of emergence of language patterns in children. However, it has not
yet proved feasible to establish independent measures of complexity deﬁned in
purely linguistic terms, such as the number of transformations in a sentence
derivation (see derivational theory of complexity), or the number of
features in the speciﬁcation of a linguistic unit (see simplicity), largely because
of controversy over the nature of the linguistic measures used, and the inter-
ference stemming from other psychological factors, such as the language user’s
attention and motivation.
Several restricted senses of complex are also used (mostly contrasting with the
term ‘simple’), e.g. ‘complex sentence’ (in two senses: either a sentence consist-
ing of more than one clause, or one consisting of a main clause and at least
one subordinate clause), ‘complex preposition’ (a preposition consisting of
more than one word), ‘complex word’ (one containing a free morpheme and at
least one bound morpheme), ‘complex tone’ (an intonational nucleus with
two distinct pitch movements), ‘complex stop’ (a plosive with two points of
articulation), ‘complex nucleus’ (a syllabic peak with two distinct vowel
qualities), ‘complex segment’ (a segment with two or more simultaneous oral
tract constrictions, in some models of feature theory), and so on. In gen-
erative grammar, a ‘complex NP’ is a noun phrase with a clause as a
complement (e.g. the assumption that the engine is working) or adjunct (e.g.
the assumption that he made). The ‘complex NP constraint’ in classical trans-
formational grammar states that no element can be extracted out of a complex
NP (e.g. *Who did you make the assumption that he liked?) – in other words,
such constructions are syntactic islands.
complex NP constraint

complex preposition
In grammar, a term sometimes used for a multi-word
construction consisting of a noun or noun phrase both preceded and followed
by a single preposition, as in on account of and in accordance with. The term

complete assimilation

may also be used to include any preposition consisting of more than one word,
such as next to.
complex sentence
In grammar, a term which in its most general application
describes a sentence consisting of more than one clause. In a somewhat narrower
sense, it refers to a sentence consisting of a main clause and at least one sub-
ordinate clause, thus contrasting with such notions as compound sentence.
complex symbol
A term used in some models of generative grammar (see
Aspects model) to refer to a symbol in a phrase-marker which has an internal
structure of its own. It consists of an unordered set of syntactic features,
e.g. [N], [+Abstract], [+Animate], and (in some accounts) the morpheme which
the set of features specify, e.g.
G+N
J
H+HumanK
H−Proper K

component (n.) (1)
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to the
main sections into which a generative grammar is organized. In Noam Chomsky’s
Syntactic Structures (1957), three components are recognized: the phrase-
structure component (which generates a set of underlying strings), the
transformational component (which acts on these strings in various
optional and obligatory ways, introducing semantic changes), and the
morphophonemic component (which converts each syntactic string into a string
of phonological units). In Chomsky’s Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965),
the model is radically altered. The phrase-structure component is replaced by a
base component, which generates the underlying phrase-markers representing
the deep structure of sentences, i.e. all semantically relevant grammatical
notions. The base component contains the categorial and lexical com-
ponents (or sub-components) of the grammar. Two things then happen to these
markers: (a) they are semantically interpreted, using the rules of the semantic
component (which has no equivalent in the Syntactic Structures model), and
(b) they are converted into surface structures through the transformational
component (which contains largely obligatory rules, the optional ones now
being handled by choices made in the base rules). Lastly, a phonological com-
ponent operates on the surface structures, providing them with a phonetic
interpretation. See Chomskyan.
(2)
In semantics, the term refers to an irreducible feature in terms of which
the sense of lexical items can be analysed, e.g. girl can be analysed into the
components ‘human’, ‘female’, ‘child’, etc. Componential analysis is a semantic
theory which developed from a technique for the analysis of kinship vocabulary
devised by American anthropologists in the 1950s. It claims that all lexical items
can be analysed using a ﬁnite set of components (or ‘semantic features’), which
may, it is felt, be universal. Certainly, several sets of lexical items exist to show
component
95

the strengths of the approach (e.g. the correspondences between boy/girl, man/
woman, ram/ewe, etc., can be stated in terms of [+male] v. [−male] or [−female]
v. [+female]. There are several limitations to the componential models of
analysis so far suggested, such as the extent to which binary analyses are
possible for many lexical items, the claimed universality of components, and the
justiﬁcation for selecting one value rather than the other for a possible com-
ponent (e.g. whether the above example should be analysed in terms of [+male]
or [−female]).
‘Componential analysis’ is also found in a general sense in linguistics, espe-
cially in Europe, referring to any approach which analyses linguistic units into
components, whether in phonology, grammar or semantics. In this view,
Prague School phonological analysis is componential, as are the analyses of
word-and-paradigm morphology.
(3)
In some approaches to phonology (e.g. dependency phonology), com-
ponent is used for a feature represented as a single (‘unary’) element, rather
than as a binary opposition. The term is given special status in unary com-
ponent theory.
componential analysis

composite verb
see composition
composition (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a hierarchical model
of linguistic structure in which larger units are seen as being made up out of
smaller units. For example, in grammatical analysis, the relationship between
sentence, clause, phrase, word, and morpheme is sometimes described as
one of composition (constituency, or rank), the units of higher rank being
analysable (decomposable) into units of lower rank. One might subsequently
analyse such structures in terms of their compositional meaning. Composi-
tional models are to be found especially in scale-and-category, tagmemic,
stratiﬁcational and phrase-structure grammars. In relation to word-
formation, the term is used both in the general sense of ‘processes of com-
pounding’, and sometimes in a restricted sense, referring to a particular type of
compound. In transformational grammar, phrasal verbs (e.g. switch on,
take off) may be referred to as composite verbs. In semantics, compositionality
is the view that the meanings of individual words can be used to build up
the meanings of larger units: the meaning of the whole is determined by the
meaning of its parts and the way in which they are assembled. The notion is
important in, for example, Montague grammar.
compositionality (n.)
see composition
compound (n.)
A term used widely in descriptive linguistic studies to refer
to a linguistic unit which is composed of elements that function independently
in other circumstances. Of particular currency are the notions of compounding
found in ‘compound words’ (consisting of two or more free morphemes, as
in such ‘compound nouns’ as bedroom, rainfall and washing machine) and
‘compound sentences’ (consisting of two or more main clauses); but other
applications of the term exist, as in ‘compound verbs’ (e.g. come in), ‘compound
96
componential analysis

tenses’ (those consisting of an auxiliary + lexical verb), ‘compound subjects/
objects’, etc. (where the clause element consists of more than one noun phrase
or pronoun, as in the boys and the girls shouted) and ‘compound prepositions’
(e.g. in accordance with). See also bahuvrihi, dvandva.
compound bilingualism
A term used by some linguists in the early classiﬁca-
tion of bilingualism (see bilingual). Compound bilinguals (or simultaneous
bilinguals) were thought to be those who learn their languages in a single
environment and develop a single mental representation for both. They attribute
identical meanings to corresponding lexical units in the two languages (e.g.
dog in English and chien in French are simply two words for the same concept).
The notion was contrasted with co-ordinate bilingualism, where there is no
such identity. The distinction is now thought to be an oversimpliﬁcation of a
situation in which most bilinguals seem to fall between the two types.
comprehension (n.)
The general sense of this term is found in linguistics,
referring to the ability to understand and interpret spoken and written language;
it is opposed to production. In psycholinguistics, the analysis of the process
of speech comprehension is a major theme, encompassing such topics as the
strategies used by children in language acquisition, the strategies adults use in
interpreting different types of sentence (e.g. ambiguity, negation, questions),
the role of the extralinguistic situation, and the role of cognitive factors
(such as memory, attention and perception) in arriving at the interpretation of
sentences and discourses.
computational linguistics
A branch of linguistics in which computational
techniques and concepts are applied to the elucidation of linguistic and phon-
etic problems. Several research areas have developed, including natural
language processing, speech synthesis, speech recognition, automatic trans-
lation, the making of concordances, the testing of grammars, and the many
areas where statistical counts and analyses are required (e.g. in literary textual
studies).
computational system
In the minimalist programme, a term used for the set
of operations required by the process of sentence composition (derivation).
Computation involves the syntactic combination of lexical items and the
construction of representations in logical form and phonetic form. The
system builds structures by selecting elements from the numeration and com-
bining them in various ways to form individual subtrees; these are ultimately
combined (‘merged’) into a single tree. The computational process is con-
strained by various economy principles, such as shortest move, procrastinate
and greed.
computer corpus
see corpus
conative (adj.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to a general type of
linguistic function – the use of language in order to achieve a result in an
addressee, in accord with the speaker’s wishes. Its use is illustrated by a range of
directive functions (e.g. commands, vocatives), but its precise sense needs to
conative
97

take into account the range of other functions recognized by the theory in which
it is used – in particular, the contrast which is often made between conative and
expressive (personal) and referential (situational) functions.
concatenate (v.)
see concatenation
concatenation (n.)
A term used in the formal representation of linguistic
structures, and especially in generative grammar, to refer to a process for
forming strings of elements, the elements being seen in a relation of linear
succession, e.g. X + Y + Z or X  »  Y  »  Z (i.e. X is concatenated with or ‘chained
together’ with Y, etc.). The concatenative properties of linguistic units are also
central to some approaches in phonetics and phonology, such as demisyllabic
analysis.
conceptual blending/integration
see blending 2
conceptual metaphor
A theory, associated with cognitive semantics, in which
metaphor is seen as a process of understanding one conceptual domain in terms
of another. A typical metaphor is a mapping between a better-known, more
concrete conceptual domain (the ‘source domain’) and the conceptual domain
which it helps to organize (the ‘target domain’). Thus a conceptual metaphor
such as THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS, as described by George Lakoff (b. 1941) and
Mark Johnson (b. 1949), has physical objects as source and abstract mental
entities as target, and gives rise to an open set of linguistic metaphors, such
as Your theories lack foundation and He needs to construct a stronger argu-
ment. In its view of metaphor as a general cognitive process, this approach
contrasts with the purely stylistic account of metaphor, with its distinction
between literal and ﬁgurative meaning, and its focus on rhetorical and literary
contexts.
conceptual processes
see perception
concessive (adj.)
In grammar, referring to a word or construction which
expresses the meaning of ‘concession’. The point expressed in the main clause
continues to be valid despite the point being made in the subordinate clause
(the concessive clause). In English, the most widely used markers of concession
are although and though.
concord (n.)
A term used in grammatical theory and description to refer to a
formal relationship between elements, whereby a form of one word requires
a corresponding form of another. In English, for example, a singular subject
co-occurs with the third-person singular form of the verb in the present tense,
e.g. he walks (v. they walk); in Latin, there is concord between the number,
gender and case of adjectives and nouns. This formal correspondence was
traditionally referred to as agreement (the adjective ‘agrees’ with the noun,
etc.), and is usually contrasted in grammatical discussion with the notion of
government. Negative concord refers to cases where an element expressing
negation requires some other element(s) in the sentence to be negative. In
Spanish, for example, sentences such as No tengo ningún dinero (‘I have no
98
concatenate

money at all’) use the negative form ningún following no, rather than the
positive form algún (‘some’).
concrete (adj.)
see abstract
condition (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to any factors which,
it might be argued, need to be taken into account in evaluating a theory, a
grammar, or an individual analysis, e.g. such conditions as external adequacy,
generality, simplicity. More speciﬁcally, it refers to any criterion which must
be met before a particular analysis may be carried out. In systemic grammar,
for example, the entry conditions specify the structural criteria which must
be satisﬁed in order for a particular grammatical system to become operative.
In transformational grammar, the structural description which pro-
vides the input to a transformational rule speciﬁes the conditions which must
be met before the rule can operate. Later, in this theory, the term was used
to refer to the factors which constrain the application of transformations, in
such contexts as movement rules. For example, one condition states that a
moved constituent can only be substituted for an empty category; another,
that a moved constituent leaves behind a co-indexed trace of itself. The
‘island condition’ asserts that subjects and adjuncts, but not complements,
are islands; i.e., constituents can be extracted out of complement phrases,
but not out of subject/adjunct phrases. Since the late 1970s, conditions on
transformations have largely been replaced by conditions on various levels
of representation, e.g. binding theory (a set of conditions on surface
structures and/or logical form) replaced several conditions on rules of
grammar proposed during the 1970s. See also entry (2), felicity conditions,
nominative.
conditional (adj./n.) (cond)
A term used in grammatical description to
refer to clauses whose semantic role is the expression of hypotheses or condi-
tions. In English, these are introduced by if, unless, and a few other conjunc-
tions (e.g. if John asks, tell him . . . ). The traditional grammatical notion of
‘conditional tense’ (using would, should) is usually interpreted in terms of
aspectual or modal verb forms in analyses of English, though this is mor-
phologically expressed in many languages (e.g. French). Sometimes the term
is used to refer to the entire two-part construction, consisting of protasis and
apodosis (see apodosis). See also material conditional.
conditioned (adj.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the form a linguistic
unit takes when this is partly or wholly determined by the linguistic context in
which it occurs. For example, in English phonology, the alveolar /t/ phon-
eme predictably becomes dental when followed by /θ/, as in eighth, i.e. [>] is
a conditioned variant of /t/; in morphophonology, the indeﬁnite article
a becomes an when followed by a vowel. The concept of allo- is the most
succinct way of referring to phonological and grammatical ‘conditioning’, and
other terms are sometimes used for the same phenomenon, e.g. ‘contextual/
positional/combinatory/automatic’ variants. The term conditioning is also some-
times used with reference to the inﬂuence of the social/cultural situation on the
choice of linguistic forms (‘environmental conditioning’).
conditioned
99

condition on extraction domains (CED)
A proposed condition in government-
binding theory restricting the class of domains from which constituents
may be moved: no constituent may be extracted out of a domain which is not
properly governed. Non-properly governed positions in English include adjuncts
and subject positions. An example is the ‘adjunct condition’, which prohibits
movement out of adjuncts: from a sentence such as You made a high score
during which match? the condition would forbid *Which match did you make a
high score during?
conﬁguration (n.) (1)
A term used to refer to the standard model of gen-
erative grammar, seen in contrast with relational theories of grammar. In a
conﬁgurational approach, phrase-markers are seen as clusters (‘conﬁgurations’)
of syntactic categories, arranged in linear order.
(2)
The term is also used generally in linguistics and phonetics for any
formally identiﬁable arrangement of elements. It has been used, for example,
with reference to the sequence of tones which constitute an intonation con-
tour (a ‘tonal conﬁguration’) and to the set of syntactic functions which
depend upon a particular verb, as in case grammar (a ‘conﬁguration of cases’).
See also automaton.
conﬁgurational languages
Languages with fairly ﬁxed word-order and hier-
archical constituent structure, e.g. English and Hebrew. Such languages are
contrasted with non-conﬁgurational languages. Both types have received a
great deal of attention in government-binding theory as subject to parametric
variation. However, the typology is not unequivocally accepted.
congruence (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a correspondence between
the decisions made at one level of analysis (phonology, grammar or seman-
tics) and those made at another. The sentence is the unit where there is
maximum congruence of levels, in that criteria of identiﬁcation at each level
tend to coincide: certain classes of exception aside, a sentence is a grammat-
ically, semantically and phonologically autonomous unit. The notion of word,
by contrast, displays less congruence (‘is less congruent’): phonological (and
orthographic), morphological, syntactic and semantic criteria often conﬂict
in word identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation.
congruity (n.)
see pattern
conjoined (adj.)
A term used especially in generative grammar to refer to
a construction where two or more sentences, phrases or words are
co-ordinated. Conjoining processes are distinct from embedding ones.
The units are conjoined using such items as and and but, as in The man fed
the cat and the lady fed the dog. The linked units are sometimes described as
conjoint.
conjugation (n.)
In grammar, a traditional term for a class of verbs in an
inﬂecting language which occur with the same range of forms. Latin verbs,
for example, belonged to four conjugations. Forms of the ‘ﬁrst conjugation’, for
example, were traditionally illustrated using the verb amare (‘to love’), which in
100
condition on extraction domains (CED)

the active indicative present tense had the endings amo, amas, amat, amamus,
amatis, amant (for ‘I/you/he-she/we/you/they’ persons respectively). ‘Fourth con-
jugation’ verbs, illustrated by audire (‘to hear’), conjugated differently; audio,
audis, audit, audimus, auditis, audiunt (for the same persons). The term is not
usually found in modern linguistic analysis (which talks in terms of word-
classes), but will be encountered in studies of linguistic historiography.
conjunct (n.)
see conjunction (1)
conjunction (n.) (1) (conj)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of
words to refer to an item or a process whose primary function is to connect
words or other constructions. The conventional subclassiﬁcation of these
‘connective’ items distinguishes co-ordinating conjunctions (e.g. and, or, but)
and subordinating conjunctions (e.g. because, when, unless) – also referred to
as ‘co-ordinators’ and ‘subordinators’ respectively. Certain types of adverbial
(those whose function is primarily connective) are also sometimes referred to as
conjunctive, or simply as conjuncts, e.g. however, moreover, indeed. A process
of conjunction is also recognized in transformational accounts (as in formal
logic), this normally being referred to as a conjoining transformation; the
conjoined elements may also be referred to as conjuncts. In logic and formal
semantics, the term is often limited in application to the word and and its
equivalents in other languages; opposed to disjunction.
(2)
In optimality theory, a term referring to the combination of two con-
straints acting simultaneously. A conjoined constraint is violated when all of
its constituent constraints are violated. For example, NoCoda-r (a prohibition
on /r/ in codas) can be created by conjoining NoCoda with *r.
conjunctive (adj.)
A term used in generative phonology to refer to a principle
affecting the ordering of rules. Conjunctive ordering is found in the use of
the brace notation, which indicates an obligatory selection of one member
of a set of alternatives. If a sequence of rules is abbreviated using this notation
– e.g.
1Y 5
X 2Z 6 P, which stands for (a) XYP, (b) XZP or (c) XWP
3W7
– then this sequence forms a conjunctively ordered block, i.e. one or other of (a),
(b) or (c) must apply. It is distinguished from disjunctive ordering.
(2)
See conjunction (1).
connected speech
A term used in linguistics to refer to spoken language
when analysed as a continuous sequence, as in normal utterances and conver-
sations. Its signiﬁcance lies in the contrast implied with studies of linguistic
units seen in isolation, such as an individual sound, word or phrase, which
were the subject-matter of much traditional linguistic enquiry. It is now realized
that important changes happen to these units when they are used in connected
speech, as demonstrated by such processes as assimilation and elision, e.g.
and becoming /n/ in such phrases as boys and girls.
connected speech
101

connection (n.)
A term used by some Firthian linguists, as part of the phrase
renewal of connection, referring to a way of validating an analysis predictively:
an analysis made on the basis of a set of data (S1) is applied again to a further
sample (S2) and is found to be adequate, in that in S2 one meets again the
exponents of the abstract units originally postulated in S1 (i.e. there has been
a ‘renewal of connection’).
connectionism (n.)
An application in linguistics of a computational frame-
work for modelling cognitive functions, based on numerical computation rather
than symbol manipulation. A connectionist network (or neural network) is devised
which models the kinds of structures and processes thought to operate in the
brain: the processing units in the network are called ‘neurons’ (in an abstract
sense) or ‘nodes’, each being excited or inhibited (according to certain numerical
formulae) by information obtained from the other units to which it is connected.
The pattern of neuronal activity represents the data being processed by the
network. A particular interpretation (e.g. of speech input data) is likely to
depend on the activity pattern of a large number of related units (‘distributed
representation’), the properties of which can be demonstrated only through
statistical analysis. Because all the processing units compute at the same time,
the approach is also known as parallel distributed processing. This approach
contrasts with the view that people process sentences by transforming repre-
sentations according to a set of rules, and rejects the notion that speakers
internalize grammars, in the generative sense. Areas of application include
the modelling of the non-discrete and statistical properties of language use,
and the study of language processing within psycholinguistics, neurolinguis-
tics, and computational linguistics (e.g. automatic speech recognition).
connective (adj./n.) (cn, conn)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation
of words to characterize words or morphemes whose function is primarily
to link linguistic units at any level. conjunctions are the most obvious
types (e.g. and, or, while, because), but several types of adverb can be seen as
connective (‘conjuncts’ such as therefore, however, nevertheless), as can some
verbs (the copulas be, seem, etc.). One type of exocentric construction is also
referred to as ‘connective’, e.g. was happy, stayed quiet, where the ﬁrst element
is the connector, and the second a predicative attribute. See also zero.
connector (n.)
see connective
connotation (n.)
A term used in semantics as part of a classiﬁcation of types
of meaning; opposed to denotation. Its main application is with reference
to the emotional associations (personal or communal) which are suggested by,
or are part of the meaning of, a linguistic unit, especially a lexical item.
Denotation, by contrast, covers the relationship between a linguistic unit and
the non-linguistic entities to which it refers. (The traditional philosophical use of
‘connotation’ and ‘denotation’ is quite different: here, the meanings involved
largely correspond to the distinction between sense and reference, the former
being concerned with the relationships of equivalence between terms and propo-
sitions, the latter with their external-world status and truth-value.) For example,
the connotations of the lexical item December might include ‘bad weather’,
102
connection

‘dark evenings’, etc. (for north Europeans, at least), or ‘parties’, ‘Christmas’, etc.
Alternative terms for connotative meaning include affective and emotive.
consequent (n.)
see apodosis
consonant (n.) (C)
One of the two general categories used for the classiﬁca-
tion of speech sounds, the other being vowel. Consonants can be deﬁned in
terms of both phonetics and phonology. Phonetically, they are sounds made
by a closure or narrowing in the vocal tract so that the airﬂow is either
completely blocked, or so restricted that audible friction is produced. Conson-
ant articulations are relatively easy to feel, and as a result are most conveni-
ently described in terms of place and manner of articulation. In addition, a
routine phonetic description of consonants would involve information about the
mode of vibration of the vocal folds (see voicing), and it is often necessary
to specify the duration of the sound, the airstream mechanism involved
and the direction of airﬂow (egressive or ingressive). From a phonological
point of view, consonants are those units which function at the margins of
syllables, either singly or in clusters.
Usually, phonetic and phonological criteria coincide: [f], for example, is a
consonant in that there is audible friction and the sound occurs marginally, as
in fat, leaf. In sounds such as [l], [r], [w] and [j], however, there is a conﬂict
between the two criteria. Phonologically, these sounds are consonants, because
their role in syllables is the same as that taken by [f], [p], etc., e.g. lip, rip, wet,
yet. But, phonetically, they lack the friction required by the above deﬁnitions:
they are vowel-like in character. Such sounds as a result are often called ‘semi-
vowels’ or semi-consonants (see approximant).
The trouble arises from having only one term to do two jobs (phonetic and
phonological descriptions). Several terminological solutions have been suggested,
the most well-known one being the suggestion of the American linguist K. L.
Pike (1912–2001) to reserve the term ‘consonant’ for the phonological level of
analysis, and to introduce contoid for the phonetic level (as opposed to vocoid).
In this way, [p] would be consonant and contoid, and [l], etc., consonant and
vocoid.
Consonantal is used in a general adjectival sense, and also has separate tech-
nical status in the distinctive feature theory of phonology, where ‘consonan-
tal’ (cons) and non-consonantal constitute one of the major class features in
terms of which speech sounds are analysed. Consonantal sounds may be deﬁned
either articulatorily or acoustically in this approach: they are produced with a
major obstruction in the middle of the vocal tract, and have low acoustic
energy. Non-consonantal sounds lack this obstruction, and have high acoustic
energy. Consonants in the above phonological sense would be analysed as
having the feature [+consonantal]: vowels would be [−consonantal].
consonant harmony
see harmony
conspiracy (n.)
A term used in generative phonology to refer to any set of
rules (or constraints) which can be seen as acting together, or ‘conspiring’, to
produce a speciﬁc result, which it would not be possible or economical to state
as a single rule.
conspiracy
103

conspire (v.)
see conspiracy
constant (adj.) (1)
A type of opposition recognized in Prague School
phonology, distinguished from neutralizable. A constant opposition exists
when all its members can occur in all possible positions, e.g. wherever /p/ might
be found in a language, a contrast with /b/ will also be found. A distinction
such as English /t/ v. /d/, however, is neutralizable because, in some positions,
the contrast disappears (as in /t/ following initial /s/).
(2)
Constant is used in logic and formal semantics for any expression which
is not a variable, and which does not contain any free variables. See also
logical constant.
constative (adj.)
A basic term used in the theory of speech acts: it refers to
utterances which are descriptive statements, capable of being analysed in
terms of truth-values. ‘Constative utterances’ are contrasted with performative
utterances, where the function is one of ‘doing’ rather than ‘saying’.
constellation (n.)
see articulatory phonology
constituency (n.)
see constituent
constituent (n.) (1)
A basic term in grammatical analysis for a linguistic
unit which is a functional component of a larger construction. In an altern-
ative formulation, a constituent is a set of nodes exhaustively dominated by
a single node. Based on a combination of intuitive and formal (e.g. distribu-
tional) criteria, a sentence can be analysed into a series of constituents, such
as subject + predicate, or NP+VP, etc. These units thus produced can, in turn,
be analysed into further constituents (e.g. a noun phrase might consist of a
determiner and a noun), and this constituent analysis process can be continued
until no further subdivisions are possible. The major divisions that can be made
within a construction, at any level, are known as the immediate constituents
(ICs) of that construction. The irreducible elements resulting from such an
analysis are known as the ultimate constituents (UCs) of the construction. So, in
analysing the sentence The clock has stopped, the ICs would be the clock and
has stopped (how these constituents are to be labelled is a separate decision-
making process). The clock has the and clock as its ICs. The ICs of has stopped
are has and stopped. And stopped can be broken down further into stop and
-ed. The process is often drawn in the form of a tree diagram, as follows:
104
conspire
the
clock
has
stop
-ed

This constituent structure may also be represented using brackets, each ana-
lytic decision being represented by the imposition of a pair of square brackets
at the appropriate points in the construction, e.g. [[the clock] [has stop[-ed]]].
A grammar which analyses sentences wholly in this way, i.e. in terms of a
hierarchy of structural layers, is sometimes called a constituent-structure
grammar; in classical generative linguistics, such an analysis is carried on by
the phrase-structure component of the grammar. The term constituency
grammar will also be encountered, as will the term constituent sentence, referring
to an embedded sentence. Constituent-base grammars need to be distinguished
from those which do not recognize constituents, such as dependency grammar
and word grammar.
The limitations of IC analysis have been much discussed in the linguistics
literature, especially in relation to the greater power of transformational
grammars. IC analysis, for example, is unable to make explicit the relationships
between formally connected sets of sentences (such as active and passive),
nor can it demonstrate the ambiguity involved in several kinds of construction
(a much-discussed example here being it is too hot to eat). But some kind of
constituent analysis is an important feature of most grammatical systems. See
also c-structure.
(2)
In non-linear phonology, a term which describes a group of features
which regularly function together as a unit in phonological rules. In this
approach, segments are represented as a hierarchy of node conﬁgurations,
in which intermediate nodes are constituents and terminal nodes are feature
values. Elements are grouped into constituents using association lines. Only
feature sets which form constituents may function together in phonological
rules. The approach uses the usual tree terminology of generative grammar:
dependents are viewed as ‘daughters’ of a higher constituent node, and ‘sisters’
of other nodes at the same level within the hierarchy.
constituent-command (v.)
see command (2)
constrain (v.)
see constraint
constraint (n.)
A term used in linguistics, and especially in generative
grammar, to refer to a condition which restricts the application of a rule,
to ensure that the sentences generated are well formed. For example, in
generative phonology, a distinction can be made between ‘simultaneous’ and
‘sequential’ constraints: the former states the restrictions on the simultaneous
occurrence of features, e.g. a segment cannot be at once [+high] and [+low];
the latter states the restrictions on sequences of features, e.g. whether a language
permits consonant clusters. In generative syntax there are also several
constraints which have to be imposed in order to prevent the derivation of
ill-formed phrase-markers, e.g. constraints on the ordering of rules. For
example, ‘surface structure’ constraints (ﬁlters, or ‘output conditions’) refer
to conditions where a characteristic of surface structure decides which phrase-
markers are well formed; e.g. no phrase-marker containing an internal boundary
symbol can qualify as a well-formed surface structure. Other examples include
island constraints and the co-ordinate structure constraint.
constraint
105

Later generative studies aimed to ﬁnd constraints which apply to large classes
of derivations (i.e. the constraints have a greater explanatory power) – a trend
which contrasts with the local application of the constraints proposed in the
1960s. ‘Constraints’, in this work, are distinguished from ‘ﬁlters’: the former are
conditions affecting two successive phrase-markers in a derivation: the latter are
conditions on a single level of structure, which serves as the output of a given set
of rules.
The notion of constraints takes a different direction in optimality theory,
where it is the principal explanatory device (abbreviated as CON). Here,
constraints are ways of characterizing language universals. Each language
has its own ranking of constraints (e.g. which determine morpheme position
or syllable structure), and differences between these rankings result in the
variations observed between languages. Constraints are found only in the con-
straint hierarchy for a language, i.e. the language’s particular ranking of the
universal set of constraints; there are no separate constraints operating on
inputs or outputs, and no rules to be constrained. The approach also uses the
notion of constraint satisfaction, representing the extent to which a constraint
can be violated in grammatical forms. All constraints are violable. The output
forms are the optimal ones (i.e. with the minimum number of constraint
violations), selected by the evaluator component of the theory. The term
is also used more generally in generative linguistics with reference to theory
construction. A linguistic theory needs to be constrained, in order to restrict
the class of potential grammars. In this sense, the main aim of linguistics is said
to be the provision of an explanatorily adequate theory which is maximally
constrained.
constraint demotion algorithm
A theory of the acquisition of an optimality
theory grammar. All constraints are initially ranked together, and as new
forms are encountered, constraints that show violations in the forms in the
data are progressively lowered in the ranking. A modiﬁcation is called the biased
constraint demotion algorithm, which starts with a ranking of all markedness
constraints over all faithfulness constraints.
constriction (n.)
A general term used in articulatory phonetics to refer to
a narrowing within the vocal tract. The different kinds and degrees of con-
striction are the basis of the articulatory classiﬁcation of sound qualities. The
term constricted is sometimes used in a restricted sense, referring to glottalized
sounds or the glottis with narrow aperture (opposed to spread). ‘Constric-
tion’ has developed a central role in phonological theory, especially in some
models of feature geometry. A constriction model aims to unify the description
of vocoids (vowels and glides) and consonants in terms of their character-
istic constriction, deﬁned by the parameters of constriction degree (a continuant
node for consonants and an aperture node for vocoids) and constriction loca-
tion (a place node, represented by ‘C-place’ for consonants and ‘V-place’ for
vocoids, and deﬁned in terms of the active articulator involved). Constrictions
are represented by a separate node in the feature hierarchy, and degree and
location are separate nodes linked under the constriction node. The deﬁnition of
dorsal, for example (involving a constriction formed by the back of the tongue)
is equally applicable to consonants and vocoids, thus avoiding the ‘two-mouth’
106
constraint demotion algorithm

descriptions of traditional approaches. The three main types of correspondence
proposed are: between labial consonants and rounded or labialized vocoids;
between coronal consonants and front vocoids; and between dorsal con-
sonants and back vocoids.
construction (n.) (1)
In its most general sense in linguistics, ‘construction’
refers to the overall process of internal organization of a grammatical unit –
a sentence, for example, being built up (constructed) out of a set of mor-
phemes by the application of a set of rules. More speciﬁcally, it refers to the
syntagmatic result of such a process, a particular type of construction (a
constructional type or pattern) being deﬁned as a sequence of units which has a
functional identity in the grammar of a language, such as subject+verb+
object (with reference to clauses), or determiner+noun (with reference to
phrases). Most speciﬁcally, it refers to a token of a constructional type, in the
sense of string, e.g. the + man + is + walking. It is constructions of this last
kind which are analysed into constituents, as in immediate-constituent
analysis. Constituents forming a syntactic relationship are said to be ‘in con-
struction with’ each other. Constructional homonymity refers to a grammatical
string with more than one interpretation in terms of the patterns of construc-
tion it contains (as deﬁned, say, by a phrase-structure grammar). In more
traditional grammatical terms, the string would be said to be ‘structurally
ambiguous’. For example, men and women in coats could be analysed as men
and [women in coats] (i.e. only the women have coats) or as men and women
[in coats] (they all have coats).
(2)
In psycholinguistics, the term is often used as part of a theory of com-
prehension, to refer to the psychological process of arriving at an interpreta-
tion of sentences, based on the ability to identify and interrelate the various
elaments and levels of meaning involved (meaning construction).
constructional homonymity
see construction (1)
constructional schema
see cognitive grammar, schema
construe (v.)
A traditional term in grammatical analysis, which refers to
the process of formally arranging words into constructional relationships,
and to the study and interpretation of these relationships. It has received a new
lease of life in generative syntax, where it is used to deﬁne the relationships
which are formed between certain types of constituents (antecedents and
anaphors) as a consequence of applying a transformational rule (rules of
construal). See also cognitive semantics.
consultant (n.)
see informant
contact (adj./n.) (1)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to a situation of
geographical continuity or close social proximity (and thus of mutual inﬂuence)
between languages or dialects. The result of contact situations can be seen
linguistically, in the growth of loan words, patterns of phonological and
grammatical change, mixed forms of language (such as creoles and pidgins),
and a general increase in bilingualism of various kinds (see bilingual). In a
contact
107

restricted sense, languages are said to be ‘in contact’ if they are used alternately
by the same persons, i.e. bilinguals. The term contact language or contact ver-
nacular is also sometimes used to refer to a pidgin.
(2)
A term used by some grammarians to describe a type of relative clause
with no relative pronoun, and where the clause is thus directly ‘in contact’
with the head noun (e.g. the book I bought): a contact clause or contact
relative. In the context of generative grammar, these clauses have no overt
complementizer nor an overt WH-phrase.
(3)
A term used in phonetics to refer to any point in the process of arti-
culation where one articulator touches another. The blade of the tongue,
for example, makes contact with the alveolar ridge during the articulation
of [t].
contact assimilation
see assimilation
containment (n.)
A principle in certain versions of optimality theory whereby
the output contains the input. No deletion is allowed.
content (n.)
The general sense of this term – referring to the meaning of an
expression – is found pre-theoretically in linguistics, but some linguists have
given it a technical status, by analysing language into two major dimensions,
distinguishing a content plane from an ‘expression plane’ (analogous to the
Saussurean distinction between the meaning and form of linguistic signs).
More speciﬁcally, some approaches to word classiﬁcation recognize a class
of content words or contentives, deﬁned as words which have stateable lexical
meaning – the majority of words in the language, in fact, apart from the few
function words, whose role is primarily to express grammatical relation-
ships. Alternative terms include lexical and full words. In semantic studies
of demonstratives and indexicals, the term is often used to designate the
meaning of an expression relative to a particular pragmatic context; it
contrasts with character.
contentive (n.)

content word

context (n.) (1)
A general term used in linguistics and phonetics to
refer to speciﬁc parts of an utterance (or text) near or adjacent to a unit
which is the focus of attention. The occurrence of a unit (e.g. a sound, word)
is partly or wholly determined by its context, which is speciﬁed in terms
of the unit’s relations, i.e. the other features with which it combines as a
sequence. The everyday sense of the term is related to this, as when one ‘puts
a word in context’ (contextualizes), in order to clarify the meaning intended,
as in dictionary entries. Providing a context in this way is referred to
as contextualization. Words, it is suggested, have meaning only when seen in
context.
Variants of sound, grammar, etc., which are dependent on context for their
occurrence are sometimes called contextual variants (or ‘conditioned variants’);
an example is the allophone (see allo-). An analysis in these terms is sometimes
108
contact assimilation

called a contextual analysis. Some scholars use the term co-text for context in
sense (1), reserving the latter term for sense (3) below.
(2)
The speciﬁcation of contexts is a particular characteristic of the formula-
tion of rules in generative linguistics, where forms can be classiﬁed in terms of
whether they occur only within a speciﬁc formal context (context-sensitive/
-restricted/-dependent rules) or are independent of context (context-free rules).
A context-free grammar is one in which all the rules apply regardless of context,
i.e. they would be all of the type ‘Rewrite X as Y’, no further conditions being
speciﬁed. A context-sensitive grammar contains some rules of the type A ⇒ B
/C–D, where the forward slash means ‘in the context of’, and the horizontal line
indicates the place in the structure where A (a single non-terminal symbol) is
rewritten as B (a non-empty string of symbols) – in this case, between C and D
(any strings of symbols). In some generative models (see Aspects model),
contextual features refer to one of the types of (binary) features which are
contained in a lexical entry (the others being inherent and rule features); such
features provide information as to where in a deep-structure representa-
tion a lexical item can occur. Three types of contextual features are recognized:
category features, strict sub-categorization features and selectional
features.
(3)
A term referring to the features of the non-linguistic world in relation to
which linguistic units are systematically used. The term ‘situation’ is also used in
this sense, as in the compound term situational context. In its broadest sense,
situational context includes the total non-linguistic background to a text or
utterance, including the immediate situation in which it is used, and the aware-
ness by speaker and hearer of what has been said earlier and of any relevant
external beliefs or presuppositions. Others restrict the term to what is imme-
diately observable in the co-occurring situation. Further distinctions are usually
made in semantics and stylistics, distinguishing, for example, referential
and emotive meaning from contextual meaning, i.e. information signalled about
the kind of use a linguistic unit has in its social context, e.g. whether it has a
‘restricted’ use (as in social pleasantries, or religious settings), or how it relates
to such factors as age, sex or class of the speakers.
(4)
Other related senses may be found. For example, the general term context
of utterance is sometimes used to refer to all the factors which systematically
determine the form, meaning or appropriateness of utterances (i.e. including
both sense (1) and sense (2) of this entry). Context is also used in hallidayan
linguistics, but in a restricted sense, as the name of an inter-level of language
organization which relates linguistic form to extralinguistic situation – it is
thus equivalent to semantics.
context change potential
A term used in ﬁle change semantics and other
dynamic semantic theories for the pattern of change produced by an expres-
sion on the information states of the participants in a discourse.
context of situation
A term in Firthian linguistic theory, deriving from the
work of the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski (1884–1942). In this theory,
meaning is seen as a multiple phenomenon, its various facets being relatable
on the one hand to features of the external world, and on the other hand to
the different levels of linguistic analysis, such as phonetics, grammar and
context of situation
109

semantics. Context of situation refers to the whole set of external-world features
considered to be relevant in the analysis of an utterance at these levels.
contextualize (v.), contextualization (n.)
see context
contiguity (n.)
A family of faithfulness constraints in optimality theory
that evaluates, along with linearity, the preservation of adjacency ordering
of segments between two forms. If two segments are adjacent in the input
form, the corresponding segments should be adjacent in the output form, and
vice versa. The metathesis of two segments preserves their adjacency but not
their linearity.
contiguous assimilation
see assimilation
contingent extrasyllabicity
see extrasyllabic
continuant (adj.) (cont)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky
and Halle (see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phono-
logy, to handle variations in manner of articulation. Continuant sounds
have been deﬁned articulatorily and acoustically, as those produced with an
incomplete closure of the vocal tract. All vowels and fricatives are [+con-
tinuant] (abbreviated as [+cont]). The opposite term in Jakobson and Halle’s
approach (see Jakobsonian) is discontinuous; in Chomsky and Halle’s later
system, it is non-continuant or stop: these are sounds produced with a complete
closure of the vocal tract, and thus characterized acoustically by a silence, as in
plosives [−continuant] [−cont]. The term interrupted is also sometimes used.
continuity hypothesis
see discontinuous (3)
continuous (adj.)
A term used in the grammatical description of verb forms,
referring to a contrast of a temporal or a durative kind, and thus handled
sometimes under the heading of tense and sometimes under aspect. The usual
contrast recognized is between ‘continuous’ or progressive (e.g. I am going)
and non-continuous, simple, or ‘non-progressive’ (e.g. I go). Linguists prefer an
aspectual analysis here, because of the complex interaction of durational,
completive and temporal features of meaning involved; traditional grammars,
however, merely refer to ‘continuous tense’, ‘continuous present’, etc., and thus
imply a meaning which is to some degree an oversimpliﬁcation.
contoid (n.)
A term invented by the American phonetician Kenneth Pike (1912–
2001) to help distinguish between the phonetic and the phonological
notions of consonant. Phonetically, a consonant is deﬁned with reference to
a complete closure in the vocal tract, or a narrowing sufﬁciently great to
cause audible friction. Phonologically, it is a unit which functions at the
margins of syllables. But there are cases where these criteria do not coincide,
such as [l], [r], [w] and [j], which function as consonants in syllables, but which
are phonetically vowel-like. To handle such cases, Pike proposed that separate
terms be used for the phonetic and the phonological deﬁnitions of all sounds:
‘contoid’ refers to the phonetic characterization of a consonant, as deﬁned above;
110
contextualize

‘consonant’ refers to the phonological sense. Its opposite is vocoid. resonants
with a central airﬂow (e.g. [j] and vocoids) are also called non-contoids.
contour (n.) (1)
A term used in suprasegmental phonology, particularly by
those phonologists working within an American tradition, to refer to a distinct-
ive conﬁguration of pitches, tones or stresses in an utterance. Several
types of contour are recognized, e.g. ‘primary’, ‘secondary’ and ‘terminal’ con-
tours, which relate to major patterns in the analysis of intonation, or the notion
of stress contour in generative phonology, which refers to a sequence of stresses
assigned through the application of the transformational cycle. Rising and
falling tones are sometimes referred to as contour tones. A contour tone system
is used in some tone languages (e.g. Thai) where the critical feature is the direc-
tion of tonal movement rather than the relative level of the tone (a contour tone
language as opposed to a register tone language).
(2)
In some models of non-linear phonology, a sequence of different fea-
tures which belong to a segment in a hierarchical feature representation.
Such segments (e.g. affricates, pre-nasalized stops) are known as contour
segments. Such segments display phonological edge effects, in that the segment
behaves as though it has the feature [+F] with regard to segments on one side
and [−F] with regard to those on the other.
(3)
In a windows model of coarticulation, the term refers to the connection
path between individual windows, representing articulatory or acoustic vari-
ation over time in a speciﬁc context; also referred to as a path.
contour tone
see contour 1
contraction (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the process or result of
phonologically reducing a linguistic form so that it comes to be attached to
an adjacent linguistic form, or fusing a sequence of forms so that they appear as
a single form. The ﬁrst kind of contracted form (or contraction) can be illus-
trated by I’ve from I have, haven’t from have not, and WANNA-contraction.
The second kind is seen in French du, des from *de le and *de les respectively.
contradiction (n.)
An application of the general sense of this term in semantics,
where it refers to a sentence which cannot be true, by virtue of its form and
meaning. For example, This table is more than 10 feet long, but it is less than
10 feet long.
contradictory (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in semantics to refer to a sense
relation between lexical items. ‘Contradictory terms’ (or ‘contradictories’) dis-
play a type of oppositeness of meaning, illustrated by such pairs as male/female
and single/married. Because of the technical use of this term in logic (where it
refers to a relationship between two propositions such that they cannot both be
true or both false), some semanticists prefer to use complementarity to refer
to the linguistic relationship involved in such opposites.
contrafactive (adj./n.)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of verb-complement
constructions, in which the proposition expressed in the complement clause
is presupposed to be false, e.g. I wish John would go, where it is presupposed
contrafactive
111

that John has not gone. Contrafactive verbs (or ‘contrafactives’) are usually
distinguished from factive and ‘non-factive’ verbs.
contrary (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in semantics to refer to a sense
relation between lexical items. ‘Contrary terms’ (or ‘contraries’) display a type
of oppositeness of meaning, illustrated by such pairs as big/little, happy/sad.
Because of the technical use of this term in logic (where it refers to the relation-
ship between two propositions such that both cannot be true, though both can
be false), some semanticists prefer to use antonymy to refer to the linguistic
relationship involved in such opposites.
contrast (n.)
A term used in linguistics for a difference between units, espe-
cially one which serves to distinguish meanings in a language (it is contrastive).
Such differences are also referred to as distinctive, functional or signiﬁcant.
The principle of contrast (or contrastivity) is considered fundamental to lin-
guistic analysis. It can be illustrated with reference to the notions of phoneme
(in particular), distinctive feature, morpheme, etc., which may all be deﬁned
as ‘minimally contrastive units’ at some level of analysis. Examples in phono-
logy are the contrast between English /p/ and /b/, or voiced v. voiceless; in
grammar, between inﬂectional endings, or the various possibilities of word-
order. Many linguists use the term opposition in the same way, but in some
approaches this term is given separate deﬁnition, referring only to the paradig-
matic differences between units (‘contrast’ being reserved for syntagmatic
differences).
contrastive accent
see accent (2)
contrastive analysis (CA)
A general approach to the investigation of language
(contrastive linguistics), particularly as carried on in certain areas of applied
linguistics, such as foreign-language teaching and translation. In a contrastive
analysis of two languages, the points of structural difference are identiﬁed,
and these are then studied as areas of potential difﬁculty (interference or
‘negative transfer’) in foreign-language learning. The claim that these differences
are the source of difﬁculty in foreign-language learning, and thus govern
the progress of the learner, is known as the contrastive analysis hypothesis.
Although strongly inﬂuential (motivating audio-lingual methods of language
teaching), by the 1980s the validity of the hypothesis had been seriously ques-
tioned, especially following research into the nature of interlanguage and into
the cognitive contribution which individuals themselves bring to the learning
task. Contrastive analyses are synchronic; analogous ‘contrastive’ studies of
two states in the history of a language would be grouped under a different
heading, such as comparative or historical linguistics.

contrastive stress

control (n.)
A term used in one of the (sub-)theories of government-binding
theory (control theory), which determines the potential for reference of
112
contrary

the abstract pronominal element PRO. For example, a PRO which is the sub-
ject of an embedded inﬁnitive clause is said to be under the ‘control’ of the
main-clause subject (its controller), after a verb like promise; but after a verb
like persuade it is controlled by the object of that verb (it is ‘non-subject-
controlled’): compare I1 promised John PRO1 to go and I persuaded John2
PRO2 to go. Still other uses of PRO are uncontrolled (that is, they have
arbitrary reference, and do not take their reference from an antecedent NP).
Control sentences subsume the equi NP deletion sentences of classical trans-
formational grammar; they are often contrasted with raising sentences.
Sometimes, control constructions are referred to as catenative constructions.
control agreement principle (CAP)
A term used in generalized phrase-
structure grammar to refer to a principle which is introduced to account for
agreement phenomena.
controller (n.)
see control
convention
linguistics uses this term in its general sense – referring to any
accepted practice in the use of language (e.g. the ‘convention’ of using certain
formulae upon leave-taking), or in developing a model of language (e.g. it is
‘conventional’ to transcribe phonemes using // brackets). But there is also a
restricted sense, where it refers to the arbitrary nature of the relationship
between linguistic expressions and their meanings: one says that the relation-
ship between the lexical item table and the thing ‘table’ is conventional, the
term here being used in a traditional philosophical sense which dates from Plato.
See cognitive grammar.
conventional implicature
see implicature
convergence (n.) (1)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to a process
of dialect change in which the dialects become more like each other (or
converge). This usually happens when a non-standard dialect falls under the
inﬂuence of the standard, but it may happen the other way round – as in the
current development of modiﬁed forms of received pronunciation in English.
Geographically adjacent speech communities are sometimes referred to as
convergence areas. The opposite effect is known as divergence. ‘Convergence’
also has a currency in historical linguistic studies, referring to the merging of
forms which at an earlier stage of a language were contrastive.
(2)
In the minimalist programme, a derivation is said to converge if a
structural description is interpretable at the level of phonetic form or at
the level of logical form. For this to happen, there should be nothing other
than phonologically interpretable features in the phonetic representation
(PF-convergence) and nothing other than semantically interpretable features
in the semantic representation (LF-convergence). If these conditions are not met,
the derivation is said to crash.

conversation analysis (CA)
A term used in linguistics and associated discip-
lines to refer to a method of studying the sequential structure and coherence
of conversations (in their everyday sense), usually employing the techniques of
ethnomethodology. The approach studies recordings of real conversations,
to establish what properties are used in a systematic way when people linguist-
ically interact. Conversation analysis is basically an empirical, inductive study,
and a contrast is often drawn with the deductive approach characteristic of
discourse analysis.
converseness (n.)
A term often used in semantics to refer to a sense relation
between lexical items. Converse terms display a type of oppositeness of mean-
ing, illustrated by such pairs as buy/sell, parent/child, employer/employee and
above/below. Buy is said to be ‘the converse of’ sell, and vice versa. In such a
relationship, found especially in the deﬁnition of reciprocal social roles, spatial
relationships, and so on, there is an interdependence of meaning, such that one
member of the pair presupposes the other member. In this respect, converseness
contrasts with complementarity, where there is no such symmetry of depend-
ence, and with the technical sense of antonymy, where there is a gradation
between the opposites.
conversion (n.)
A term used in the study of word-formation to refer to the
derivational process whereby an item comes to belong to a new word-class
without the addition of an afﬁx, e.g. verbs/nouns: smell/taste/hit/walk/bottle/
brake; adjectives/verbs: dirty/empty/lower. Some grammars distinguish between
full conversion and partial conversion – the latter being cases where only some
of the characteristics of the new word-class are adopted (e.g. the rich). Other
terms used for this phenomenon, which is very common in English, include
‘zero derivation’ and ‘functional shift’.
co-occurrence (n.)
A term used in linguistics and phonetics to refer to the
permitted syntagmatic combination of units, according to the grammatical
and lexical rules of a language. For example, a co-occurs with boy, but not
with information; eke co-occurs with out, but not with in. The constraints
involved are known as co-occurrence relations or restrictions, and are often
speciﬁed in the form of context-sensitive or tactic rules. The dependencies
involved may be unidirectional (e.g. adverbs co-occurring with verbs, but not
necessarily the other way round), bidirectional (e.g. transitive verbs and
objects), and mutually exclusive (e.g. a cannot co-occur with an in the same
noun phrase).
co-operative principle
A term derived from the work of the philosopher H. P.
Grice (1913–88) and now frequently used in linguistics as part of the study of
conversational structure. At its simplest, the principle states that speakers try
to co-operate with each other when communicating: they will, in particular,
attempt to be informative, truthful, relevant and clear (maxims of ‘quantity’,
‘quality’, ‘relation’ and ‘manner’ respectively). Listeners will normally assume
that a speaker is following these criteria. Speakers may break these maxims (in
114
conversational turn

lying, sarcasm, political debates, etc.) but conversation proceeds on the assump-
tion that they do not. It is then possible to deduce implications from what has
been said concerning what has not been said (conversational implicatures),
though the extent to which this can be done consistently and generally is
somewhat controversial.
co-ordinate bilingualism
A term used by some linguists in the early classiﬁca-
tion of bilingualism (see bilingual). Co-ordinate bilinguals are those who learn
their languages in different environments, associate them with different cultures,
and develop different mental representations. They thus attribute partly or wholly
different meanings to corresponding lexical units in the two languages
(e.g. dog in English would mean something different from chien in French). The
contrast was with compound bilingualism, where the meanings are seen as
identical; but the existence of much bilingual behaviour that falls between these
two categories has made the distinction unfashionable.
co-ordinating conjunction
see co-ordination
co-ordination (n.)
A term in grammatical analysis to refer to the process or
result of linking linguistic units which are usually of equivalent syntactic
status, e.g. a series of clauses, or phrases, or words. (In this respect, it is usu-
ally distinguished from subordinate linkage, where the units are not equivalent.)
Co-ordinate clauses are illustrated in the sentence John walked and Mary ran:
the marker of linkage is and, a co-ordinating conjunction (or co-ordinator).
Constructions may also be analysed as co-ordinate without any explicit marker
(a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ‘asyndetic co-ordination’), as in There
was an awkward, depressing silence, where the co-ordinative role of the two
adjectives can be tested by the insertion of and between them. The co-ordinate
structure constraint in generative grammar asserts that no rule may affect a
conjunct in a co-ordinate structure, nor may any element in a conjunct be
affected by a rule; for example, a WH-phrase moves illicitly in *What did you eat
biscuits and?
co-ordinator (n.)
see co-ordination
Copenhagen School
A group of linguists who constituted the Copenhagen
Linguistic Circle in the mid-1930s, and who developed an approach to linguistics
known as glossematics. Largely through the work of their main theoretician,
Louis Hjelmslev (1899–1965), the school developed a philosophical and logical
basis for linguistic theory which was not to be surpassed until the formalization
introduced by generative grammar.
co-phonology (n.)
see co-grammar
co-production (n.)
A term used in relation to gestural phonology referring
to the core process which controls the way articulatory gestures combine to
produce the segments of connected speech. Each gesture has an intrinsic
temporal duration which allows it to overlap with other gestures when
executed, the degree of overlap being controlled by the co-production process at
the planning stage of speech production.
co-production

copula (n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a linking
verb, i.e. a verb which has little independent meaning, and whose main
function is to relate other elements of clause structure, especially subject and
complement. In English, the main copular (or copulative) verb is be, e.g. She is
a doctor, and the term is often restricted to this verb; but there are many others
which have a similar function, e.g. She feels angry, That looks nice, He fell ill.
copy (v.)
see copying
copying (n.)
A basic syntactic operation within the framework of trans-
formational grammar which adds a duplicate of a constituent in a phrase-
marker to some other part of the phrase-marker. For example, to make a rule
deriving tag questions from such sentences as He is a doctor, the verb is
taken and copied to the right of the sentence (changing its status from posit-
ive to negative); the tag-subject is a pronominal copy of the main subject,
placed to the right of this verb. This would be one way of generating the
sentence He is a doctor, isn’t he? The verb is copied only if it is auxiliary or
copula, and replaced by a form of do otherwise (e.g. John knows the answers,
doesn’t he). Outside generative linguistics, some linguists use copy tags
to refer to a subtype of tag questions, viz. only those which retain the same
positive or negative value as the main-clause verb (the others being referred
to as checking tags), e.g. He’s coming, is he? The minimalist programme
endorses the copy theory of movement: when a constituent moves, it leaves
a copy of itself. A chain therefore consists of multiple copies of the moved
constituent. Copy theory replaces trace theory in government-binding
theory.

core (adj./n.) (1)
In the phrase core grammar, the term is used in generative
linguistics to refer to the universal set of linguistic principles which charac-
terize all the unmarked grammatical principles found in language. A rule
which conforms to these principles is a core rule; one which does not is a non-
core rule. A core grammar can be developed for an individual language or for
language in general (a ‘theory of core grammar’).
(2)
In the phrase common core, the term refers to the set of linguistic features
which are shared by all varieties of a language.
(3)
In phonology, core is sometimes used for a constituent of syllable
structure comprising the nucleus and coda, more usually referred to as the
rhyme (as in metrical phonology).
(4)
In role and reference grammar, core identiﬁes one of the two basic
concepts used in analysing clause structure; opposed to periphery. The core
layer contains the verb nucleus and associated arguments.
co-referential (adj.)
A term used in linguistics, and especially in generative
grammar, to refer to constituents in a sentence that have the same refer-
ence. For example, in the sentence I said I would leave, the two subjects are
co-referential; in He said he would go it is unclear whether co-referentiality
applies, as the second he might refer to someone else. The distinction can be
116
copula

formulated using referentiality indices (co-indexing), e.g. Shei said shei would
go (co-referential) v. Shei said shej would go (‘non-co-referential’).
co-representational grammar
A linguistic theory developed in the 1970s as
an alternative to transformational grammar, which aims to relate surface
structure directly to semantic structure. The approach proposes a single
structure which co-represents both the syntactic and the semantic aspects of a
sentence’s internal relations. The single level of surface syntactic structure
contains only information about class membership, linear sequence and noun-
phrase hierarchy; the semantic structure contains only information about the
relations between predicates and their arguments.
coronal (adj.) (cor, COR)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and
Halle (see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to
handle variations in place of articulation (cavity features). Coronal sounds
are deﬁned articulatorily, as those produced with the blade of the tongue
raised from its neutral position. alveolar, dental and palato-alveolar con-
sonants are [+coronal] (abbreviated as [+cor]). Its opposite is non-coronal,
referring to sounds produced with the tongue blade in neutral position, as in
labial and velar consonants [−coronal] ([−cor]). The term has continued to be
used in later phonological theory, especially in various non-linear models. For
example, in articulator-based feature models, it refers to a single-valued
node involving the tongue front as an active articulator. In constriction-
based models, it is deﬁned as a constriction formed by the front of the tongue.
Coronalization is a term used to express several kinds of relationship between
coronal consonants and front vowels (see palatalization); for example,
the process of velar consonants becoming coronal, or anterior consonants
becoming coronal, before front vowels.
coronalization (n.)
see coronal
corpus, plural corpora (n.) (1)
A collection of linguistic data, either written
texts or a transcription of recorded speech, which can be used as a starting-
point of linguistic description or as a means of verifying hypotheses about a
language (corpus linguistics). Linguistic descriptions which are ‘corpus-
restricted’ have been the subject of criticism, especially by generative gram-
marians, who point to the limitations of corpora (e.g. that they are samples
of performance only, and that one still needs a means of projecting beyond
the corpus to the language as a whole). In ﬁeldwork on a new language, or
in historical study, it may be very difﬁcult to get beyond one’s corpus (i.e.
it is a ‘closed’ as opposed to an ‘extendable’ corpus), but in languages where
linguists have regular access to native-speakers (and may be native-speakers
themselves) their approach will invariably be ‘corpus-based’, rather than corpus-
restricted. Corpora provide the basis for one kind of computational linguis-
tics. A computer corpus is a large body of machine-readable texts. Increasingly
large corpora (especially of English) have been compiled since the 1980s,
and are used both in the development of natural language processing soft-
ware and in such applications as lexicography, speech recognition, and machine
translation.

correctness (n.)
A term usually encountered in linguistics in the context of
criticism of prescriptive attitudes to language. The judgements of tradi-
tional grammarians that usages were either ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ (correct v. incor-
rect) has been replaced by a concern to describe the observable facts of linguistic
usage, without reference to value judgements, and to replace absolute notions
of correctness by an emphasis on the relative appropriateness of language
to social settings. Similarly, the question of evaluating grammar in terms of
correctness (as in a decision procedure) has given way to a concern over the
relative merits of competing grammars, bearing in mind their purpose (as in an
evaluation procedure). See also acceptability.
correlation (n.)
A term used in Prague School phonology to refer to a
systematic relationship between two series of sounds. For example, the series of
voiceless and voiced fricatives in English are related by a ‘correlation’ of
voice; voice is thereby the ‘mark of correlation’.
correlative (adj.)
In grammar, referring to a construction which uses a pair of
connecting words. Constructions of this kind in English include either . . . or . . . ,
not only . . . but also . . . and if . . . then. . . .
correspond (v.)
see correspondence
correspondence (n.) (1)
A term used in linguistics to refer to any similarity
of form between words or structures in related languages. For example,
there is a stateable relationship between the sound structure of such words as
ﬁsh and piscis (Latin); /f/ and /p/ can be shown to be in systematic correspond-
ence, because of the nature of the sound changes which took place in the history
of English.
(2)
A sub-theory within optimality theory which focuses on the relationship
between two forms. Correspondence relations and constraints on correspond-
ence relations can obtain between any two representations, such as an input
and a candidate output, or an input and a part of a candidate (such as a base
or a feature). Related forms are in correspondence when there is a mapping
from one form to the other. Examples of correspondence constraints are: every
feature or segment in the input has an identical correspondent in the output
(maximality) and segments should be in the same order in input and output
representations (linearity). See also alignment, contiguity, dependence,
identity.
(3)
The notion is often encountered in semantic discussion, deriving from the
common philosophical view of truth, that a proposition is true only if it
denotes an actual state of affairs which veriﬁes it. The classical correspondence
theory of meaning argued that there is a direct relationship between a linguistic
form and the entity it denotes, as shown, for example, by the existence of
onomatopoeic words (such as splash and murmur). Because the vast majority of
the words in a language demonstrate only the arbitrariness of the relationship
118
corpus-internal/-external evidence

between ‘words’ and ‘things’, however, this view is often called the correspond-
ence fallacy.
correspondence hypothesis
A view which attracted considerable psycholin-
guistic interest in the 1960s, especially with reference to language acquisition
studies; also known as the derivational theory of complexity (DTC). It states
that the number or sequence of rules used in the grammatical derivation
of a sentence corresponds to the amount of psychological processing that
takes place in speech production and speech perception. Evidence in its
favour came from several experiments which showed that the time it took for
speakers to process sentences with more complex derivations was longer than
their less complex counterparts (e.g. passives as opposed to actives, negatives
as opposed to afﬁrmatives). Further experimental evidence, in the late
1960s, was less convincing, however, and methodological problems were raised
(e.g. how one separates out effects due to length and meaning, as well as
transformational history); there have also been radical theoretical changes in
the notions of transformation involved. As a result, the correspondence hypo-
thesis is no longer inﬂuential as a research paradigm.
cost (n.)
A term used metaphorically in generative phonology in discussing
the relative simplicity or naturalness of phonological analyses. Increasing
the complexity of an analysis (e.g. by adding features or rules) is said to add
to its cost, and vice versa. The principle involved here is a general one, some-
times discussed with reference to the notion of ‘diminishing returns’: as more
classes of linguistic unit are set up, each class comes to subsume fewer
data, and, while this permits an increase in the ability of the grammar to
handle exceptions, there is a consequential drop in generality. There is thus
plenty of room for controversy over where the least costly cut-off point in an
analysis would be, in trying to reconcile generality with depth of descriptive
detail. In the minimalist programme, cost relates to the complexity in the
derivation. See also economy.
co-text (n.)
A term used by some British linguists in an attempt to resolve the
ambiguity of the term context, which can refer to both linguistic and
situational environments. The practice is to reserve ‘co-text’ for the former,
and ‘context’ for the latter.
count (adj.)
see countable
countable (adj.)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of nouns;
opposed to ‘uncountable’ or mass. This countability distinction was often
unrecognized in traditional grammars, but it has been a focus of attention in
linguistic analyses of the noun phrase, because of the way it can explain the
distribution of nouns in relation to the use of such items as articles and
quantiﬁers. Countable (count or ‘unit’) nouns are those denoting what the
language treats as separable entities, by using them with such forms as a, many,
two, three, etc.; uncountable or non-count nouns are treated as continu-
ous entities, having no natural bounds, by being used with such forms as much,
some. The contrast can be seen in a boy v. *much boy, and *an information v.
countable
119

much information. Many nouns can be used in both contexts, e.g. a cake/many
cakes/much cake.
counter-agent (n.)
A term used in later case grammar to refer to the force or
resistance against which an action is carried out.
counter-bleeding (n.)
see bleeding
counter-example (n.)
linguistics and phonetics use this term in its general
sense, referring to the process of constructing or encountering a piece of data
which falsiﬁes a hypothesis, and thus leads to revision in an analysis. As in other
sciences, there is frequent discussion of whether a suggested counter-example is
real or apparent, i.e. able to be analysed in such a way that one’s hypothesis can
be salvaged.
counter-factual (adj./n.)
A term used in grammar and semantics to refer to a
type of conditional sentence which refers to a totally hypothetical situation,
such as If she had taken the train, she would have arrived on time. Counter-
factual or ‘unreal’ statements (‘counter-factuals’) are usually contrasted with such
‘real’ conditional statements as If she took the train, she will have arrived on time.
Both types of sentence can be discussed with reference to the notion of factivity.
counter-feeding (n.)
see feeding
counter-intuitive (adj.)
A term used to characterize an implausible analysis,
according to the intuition of the native-speaker or the linguist. For example,
an analysis which derives statements from questions is felt to be less natural
than one which derives questions from statements, and these feelings can be
to some degree supported experimentally (e.g. by showing differences in reac-
tion times). Obtaining intuitive reactions from native-speakers in a systematic,
veriﬁable way is not easy, however, and is not often done; and the dangers of
circularity are evident, especially when native-speaker and linguist are the same
person (as is usually the case in much of the work done in theoretical linguistics):
it is very easy to allow one’s intuitions as a native-speaker to be swayed by the
purpose of one’s analysis as a linguist. The problems inherent in the counter-
intuitiveness criterion have been satirically summarized in one deﬁnition (by the
British linguist Angus MacIntosh (1914–2005)): ‘going against everything that
suits my theory or purpose, and don’t ask me to explain why!’
count noun
see countable
covered (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle
(see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to
handle variations in place of articulation (cavity features). It is a tentative
categorization, referring to sounds produced with a narrowed, tensed pharynx
and raised larynx, as may occur in some West African languages on tensed
vowels. Its opposite is non-covered, where there is no such narrowing and
tensing of the pharynx.
120
counter-agent

covert (adj.) (1)
A term used in linguistic analysis to refer to the relation-
ships between linguistic forms which are not observable in the surface structure
of a sentence, but emerge only when sets of sentences are brought into relation-
ship with each other; opposed to overt. Examples of covert relations include
substitutability (as in the notion of word-class) and transformational
equivalence. ‘Covert WH-movement’ involves the movement of a phonologically
null element, as occurs with that-relatives or comparatives in government-
binding theory.
(2)
In the minimalist programme, a term describing the subsystem (the cov-
ert component) which, following the operation of spell-out, continues the
computation of a sentence to logical form; it contrasts in this model with the
‘phonological component’, which leads to a representation in phonetic form.
(3)
A term used in sociolinguistics as part of the analysis of the way linguistic
forms carry social prestige: in covert prestige, forms belonging to vernacular
dialects are positively valued, emphasizing group solidarity and local identity.
This kind of prestige is covert, because it is usually manifested subconsciously
between members of a group, unlike the case of overt prestige, where the forms
to be valued are publicly recommended by powerful social institutions.
CP
An abbreviation in government-binding theory for complementizer
phrase, the maximal projection of C (C″). CP is the largest unit of gram-
matical analysis (the initial symbol), equivalent to S′ in earlier GB, and in lexical
functional grammar and generalized phrase-structure grammar.
C-place (n.)
see constriction
cps
see cycle (3)
cranberry morpheme
In grammar, a term referring to a bound morpheme
which has no clear meaning or grammatical function, but which none the less
distinguishes one word from another. The classic example is the ﬁrst element of
cranberry, where cran- has no other function in English than to differentiate this
word from blackberry, blueberry, etc. Sometimes several items present the same
kind of difﬁculty for morphological theory, as in the group of words ending in
-ceive (receive, deceive, etc.).
crash (v.)
see convergence (2)
creak (n.)
see creaky
creaky (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of voice quality, on
the basis of articulatory and auditory phonetic criteria. It refers to a vocal
effect produced by a very slow vibration of only one end of the vocal folds;
also known as vocal fry. Some speakers do have an abnormally creaky voice
quality, as a permanent feature of their speech. What is of particular signiﬁcance
for linguistic analysis is that creaky effects may be used with contrastive force,
communicating a paralinguistic meaning: in received pronunciation, for
example, it is often heard helping to express disparagement, when a phrase
creaky
121

such as Oh I don’t know is pronounced at a very low pitch level. Creaky voice,
or simply creak, is also sometimes encountered as a phonological characteristic,
as in Hausa, where there is an opposition between creaky and non-creaky
plosives. Creaky sounds are also called ‘laryngealized’.
creativity (n.)
An application in linguistics of the usual sense of this term to
refer to the capacity of language users to produce and understand an inde-
ﬁnitely large number of sentences, most of which they will not have heard or
used before. Seen as a property of language, it refers to the ‘open-endedness’ or
productivity of patterns, whereby a ﬁnite set of sounds, structures, etc., can
be used to produce a potentially inﬁnite number of sentences. In contrast with
studies of animal communication, linguistic creativity is considered to be a
species-speciﬁc property: the creation of new sentences is not a feature of animal
communication systems. The notion of creativity has a long history in the dis-
cussion of language, but it has become a central feature of contemporary studies
since the emphasis placed upon it by Noam Chomsky (see Chomskyan). One of
the main aims of linguistic enquiry, it is felt, is to explain this creative ability,
for which such constructs as generative rules have been suggested. Care
must, however, be taken to avoid confusing this sense of ‘creative’ with that
found in artistic or literary contexts, where notions such as imagination and
originality are central.
creole (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to a pidgin language
which has become the mother-tongue of a speech community, as is the case
in Jamaica, Haiti, Dominica, and several other ex-colonial parts of the world.
The process of creolization expands the structural and stylistic range
of the pidginized language, so that the creolized language becomes comparable
in formal and functional complexity to other languages. A process of
decreolization takes place when the standard language begins to exert inﬂu-
ence on the creole, and a post-creole continuum emerges. However, this
process is not the reverse of creolization, and therefore some sociolinguists
have suggested alternative terms for this stage, such as metropolitanization.
When the development of a creole approaches that of the source language,
recreolization may occur, with speakers introducing creole features into the
standard variety (as has been observed, for example, in London Jamaican English).
See also creoloid.
creolization (n.), creolize (v.)
see creole
creoloid (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics for a variety of language
which displays linguistic resemblances to a creole (e.g. in simpliﬁcation, or in
the mixing of features from different source languages) while lacking a history
of origin in a pidgin language. Creoloids may have a strong tradition of use by
native-speakers (as in the case of Afrikaans) or be used entirely by people who
have developed it as a second language (as with Singaporean English). The
process which leads to their formation is creoloidization.
criteria, singular criterion (n.)
In linguistics and phonetics this term is used
with reference to the formal justiﬁcation of an analysis or description – why
122
creativity

one carries out a linguistic analysis in a particular way. The criteria may result
from general considerations of the purpose of one’s analysis (e.g. whether pure
or applied, theoretical or descriptive, synchronic or diachronic), or may
relate to the range of speciﬁc factors felt to be relevant to a restricted problem.
For example, in the setting up of word-classes, decisions must be made as to
whether purely linguistic criteria will be used (e.g. phonological, grammat-
ical, semantic), or whether reference will be made to non-linguistic criteria (e.g.
logical, notional, aesthetic). Linguistics has generally emphasized two prin-
ciples: that criteria should always be made explicit, and should as far as possible
be based on formal considerations, e.g. of grammar or phonology. The term is
also used with reference to the levels of adequacy (‘criteria of adequacy’) of a
grammatical theory.
critical discourse analysis
see critical linguistics
critical linguistics
A developing branch of linguistics which aims to reveal
hidden power relations and ideological processes at work in spoken or written
texts. Critical linguists criticize mainstream linguistics for its formalist preoc-
cupations, lacking adequate social explanations, and obscuring ideological and
political issues. The study includes such topics as the social context of texts,
grammar production, and language policy. The notion has also been extended
to such areas as pragmatics and sociolinguistics, and speciﬁcally to the
study of discourse. Critical discourse analysis is a perspective which studies the
relationship between discourse events and sociopolitical and cultural factors,
especially the way discourse is ideologically inﬂuenced by and can itself inﬂu-
ence power relations in society.
critical period
In child language acquisition, the hypothesis that there is a
particular time span during which a ﬁrst language can be most easily acquired.
The notion of a critical period is well supported in several areas of child
development (e.g. with reference to the development of the mechanism of
swallowing), and was felt to be also relevant to the emergence of language. It
was argued that the critical period for language ends at puberty, because by this
time the brain has become specialized in its functions, and no longer has the
adaptability found at earlier stages of biological development. The hypothesis
has proved to be extremely difﬁcult to test, and remains controversial. The study
of language-deprived children (reared in the wild or by animals – ‘feral children’
– or kept isolated from society – ‘attic children’) provides some support; but
studies of adult language learning indicate that the brain is more plastic in
adulthood than was once believed and that its language functions are more
widely distributed. Adults moreover have certain cognitive abilities which facilitate
language acquisition, such as increased motivation and greater metalinguistic
awareness.
crossover (adj.)
A term used in generative grammar, referring to a principle
restricting the operation of certain transformations which move a noun
phrase (as in passives, reﬂexives, tough movement). In an early formula-
tion, the principle states that a transformation cannot apply to a phrase-marker
if it would result in one noun phrase crossing another with which it is
crossover
123

co-referential. The crossover constraint or principle would be used, for
example, to explain why passivization cannot apply to structures of the type
John washed himself: given an underlying structure Johni washed Johni, to
derive a passive Johni was washed by Johni would involve a violation of this
principle. In later formulations, more speciﬁc constraints on the application of
this principle are introduced. In government-binding theory, weak crossover
refers to cases of crossover phenomena which involve the movement of an
R-expression across a non-c-commanding co-indexed pronoun, as in *Whoi
does hisi mother love ti? Strong crossover refers to cases which involve this
movement across a c-commanding co-indexed pronoun, as in [*Whosei mother]j
does hei love tj? The latter case is eliminated through condition C of binding
theory. A leftness principle excludes all cases of weak crossover, and allows
a uniﬁed account of these phenomena at the level of logical form. See also
bijection principle.
cross-sectional (adj.)
An application of the general use of this term in the ﬁeld
of child language acquisition, referring to one of the two main procedures
used in order to study the process of language development. In a cross-
sectional study, the language of a group of children of the same or different ages
is compared at a given point in time. This method contrasts with a longitu-
dinal study, which follows the course of language acquisition in a single child
or group over a period of time.
cryptophasia (n.)
see idioglossia
c-selection
see selectional feature
C-slot (n.)
see slot (2)
c-structure (n.)
An abbreviation in lexical-functional grammar for
constituent-structure. This is essentially the surface structure of a
sentence, and contrasts with f-structure (or functional structure), which
provides an analysis of the sentence in terms of grammatical functions such as
subject and object.
cue (n.)
see acoustic feature
culminativity (n.)
In metrical grid theory, a foot-shape parameter which
constrains every content word to contain one stressed syllable. This is a
consequence of the nature of the prosodic hierarchy, and of the exhaustivity
condition, which requires every syllable to be included in metrical structure.
More generally, any prosodic process which makes certain syllables more pro-
minent is described as culminative.
cultural transmission
A suggested deﬁning property of human language
(contrasting with the properties of many other semiotic systems), whereby
the ability to speak a language is transmitted from generation to generation by
a process of learning, and not genetically. This is not to deny that children may
be born with certain innate predispositions towards language, but it is to
124
cross-sectional

emphasize the difference between human language, where environmental learning
has such a large role to play, and animal systems of communication, where
instinct is more important.
cumulative (adj.) (1)
A term used in semantics to designate a reading peculiar
to sentences containing more than one plural noun phrase, in which none
of the plural noun phrases is interpreted as being in the scope of the others. For
example, the cumulative reading of Six hundred Dutch ﬁrms have ﬁve thousand
American computers is paraphrasable as ‘The number of Dutch ﬁrms which
have an American computer is 600, and the number of American computers
possessed by a Dutch ﬁrm is 5000’.
(2)
In semantics, a predicate is said to have cumulative reference if, when-
ever it accurately applies to two individuals, it also applies to their sum. plural
and mass nouns are generally cumulative. If X and Y are both accurately
described as water, then the sum of X and Y can also be accurately described as
water.
cupping (n.)
A term sometimes used in phonetics for one of the transverse
articulations which may be made by the tongue: speciﬁcally, it refers to the
way the tongue body is able to adopt a concave, hollowed shape during an
articulation, by allowing the mid-line of the tongue to drop lower than the sides.
The effect is common in the formation of retroﬂex consonants. A contrast
can be drawn with grooving.
curly brackets
see bracketing
CV, CVC, etc. (1)
Abbreviations for consonant and vowel sequences, used
especially in describing the types of syllable which exist in a language; e.g. in
English the statement of the phonotactic possibilities will include the informa-
tion that it is possible to have CCCV- initially, as in splice, and -VCCCC
ﬁnally, as in sixths.
(2)
CV is also a commonly used abbreviation for cardinal vowel.
CV phonology
A term used in phonology for a model which adds a con-
sonant (C) and vowel (V) tier to the syllabic and segmental tiers previously
recognized in autosegmental phonology. The addition of this tier removes
the need for the feature [syllabic] at the skeletal tier.
CV rule
see onset (1)
CV-tier (n.)
see skeletal tier
cycle (n.) (1)
A principle in transformational generative grammar that
allows rules to apply in a repeated ordered way to sections of a phrase-
marker where a particular structural description is met, instead of in a
single scan to the phrase structure as a whole. This application of the rules
is referred to as cyclic (or cyclical), and the whole process is known as the
transformational cycle or cyclic principle. Its formalization requires that
the rules apply ﬁrst to the underlying sentence most deeply embedded in a
cycle
125

phrase-marker (the ﬁrst cycle), and then to the next highest sentence (the second
cycle), until the matrix sentence is arrived at. On each application, at a given
level, in this view, the rules may not take into account information higher up
the phrase-marker. This principle allows a less complicated analysis to be assigned
to sentences with ‘repeated’ elements, such as The man seems to want to try a
second time.
Various types of cyclic rules have been suggested, e.g. ‘last-cyclic’ rules, which
apply only to the highest level in a derivation. Cyclic transformations
reduce in number in later versions of transformational grammar – ulti-
mately reducing to a single rule of (alpha) movement – and are constrained by
several conditions on their applicability (such as the subjacency condition,
the speciﬁed-subject condition and the tensed-subject condition). Post-
cyclic rules are also recognized in the extended standard theory, to refer to
a type of transformation which applies after cyclic transformations have been
completed, as might be suggested for handling inversion, the initial placement
of question words in English (e.g. Where did John say that he was going?),
or in tag formation. A successive cyclic analysis is one where superﬁcially
unbounded movement processes are analysed as involving a succession of bounded
processes, e.g. in What did you say that you would do?, where WH-movement
would be applied in successive steps, crossing a single inﬂection phrase bound-
ary in each of its applications. See also phase (4).
In generative phonology, the cyclic principle was established by Chomsky
and Halle (see Chomskyan) to account for the variations in stress contrast in
relation to vowel quality within words and sentences. It is argued that the
place of a word’s main stress, and the remaining stresses in a polysyllabic
word, are explainable by referring to the syntactic and the segmental phono-
logical structure of an utterance. The surface structure of a sentence, in
this view, is seen as a string of formatives which are bracketed together in
various ways, the brackets reﬂecting the grammatical structure assigned to
the sentence, such as sentence, noun phrase, verb phrase, e.g. [[the [elephant]]
[[kick[ed]] [the [ball]]]]. The cyclic principle makes the phonological rules apply
ﬁrst to the maximal strings that contain no brackets; once the rules are
applied, the brackets surrounding these strings are erased. The phonological
rules then apply again to the maximal strings without brackets produced by this
ﬁrst procedure, and again the innermost brackets are erased. The procedure
continues until all brackets have been removed. Various types of rule have been
devised to make this cyclical procedure work, such as the Compound Rule and
the Nuclear Stress Rule, both of which are ways of assigning main degrees
of stress to the various constituents of a sentence (the ﬁrst in relation to
compound items, the second to sequences of items in phrases). In later phono-
logical theory, the strict cycle condition (SCC) is a constraint governing the
proper application of cyclic rules: it states in essence that cyclic rules apply only
to derived representations. See also lexical phonology.
(2)
In semantics, the term is sometimes used to refer to a type of sense
relationship between lexical items (a subtype of incompatibility). Lexical
cycles (or cyclical sets) are sets of items organized in terms of successivity, but
lacking any ﬁxed end-points, e.g. days of the week, months of the year. ‘Serial’
ordering, by contrast, displays ﬁxed end-points, as in military ranks.
126
cycle

(3)
A term derived from the study of the physics of sound, and used in acous-
tic phonetics, referring to a single to-and-fro movement (oscillation) of an air
particle in a waveform around its point of rest. frequency used to be measured
in cycles per second (cps), but this unit has now been replaced by the hertz (Hz).

D
dangling participle
In traditional grammar, a term describing the use of a
participle, or a phrase introduced by a participle, which has an unclear or
ambiguous relationship to the rest of the sentence; also called a misrelated
participle. If taken literally, the sentence often appears nonsensical or laughable:
Driving along the street, a runaway dog gave John a fright. To avoid such inadvert-
ent effects, manuals of style recommend that such sentences be rephrased, with
the participial construction moved or replaced, as in When John was driving
along the street, a runaway dog gave him a fright.
dark l
An impressionistic but commonly used term for a variety of lateral
sound, where the resonance is that of a back vowel of an [u] quality, as in
the standard-English pronunciation of /l/ after vowels, before consonants,
and as a syllabic sound, e.g. pull, altar, bottle; it is opposed to clear L.
Alternatively, one might refer to this quality as a ‘velarized’ /l/ (see velar),
transcribing it [l].
data (n.)
A term used in its general sense in linguistics, referring to the
phenomena which constitute the subject-matter of enquiry – what has been
variously identiﬁed in terms of linguistic ‘behaviour’, ‘knowledge’, ‘abilities’,
‘processes’, etc. – and any associated observations and inferences which linguists
make as they go about their business. There have, however, been two distinct
views concerning the nature of this subject-matter, which are usually seen in
opposition to each other. The traditional conception of linguistic data is limited
to the observable patterns of speech and writing, especially when recorded and
gathered together in a corpus; generative linguistic theory, on the other hand,
goes beyond this, including as part of the raw data for analysis the language
user’s judgements (intuitions) about the language. Much controversy has been
generated by these opposed views (which are related to the more basic diver-
gences between behaviourist and mentalist philosophies), and the issue is
still prominent, criticisms being made of the limited reliability and generality of
observable data, and of the uncertain veriﬁability and objectivity of mentalistic
data, as evidence of linguistic system. In language acquisition, the term
‘primary linguistic data’ refers to the language input to the child, deriving from
parents, siblings, etc.

dative (adj./n.) (dat, DAT)
One of the forms taken by a noun phrase (often a
single noun or pronoun) in languages which express grammatical relation-
ships by means of inﬂections. The dative case (‘the dative’) typically expresses
an indirect object relationship, or a range of meaning similar to that covered
by to or for in English: but there is a great deal of variation between languages
in the way this case is used. English itself does not have a dative case form, but
expresses the notion of indirect object using prepositions and word-order,
e.g. he gave a book to the boy or he gave the boy a book. In classical transforma-
tional grammar, the dative movement transformation related ditransitive
constructions of this kind. An ethical dative (also ethic dative or dative of
advantage) expresses the person with a particular interest in an action, as in the
use of me in the Shakespearian ‘he plucked me ope his doublet’ (Julius Caesar
I.ii.263). The term is given special status in case grammar, where it refers to
the case of the animate being affected by the verb’s state or action (later,
experiencer). A frequently used alternative is recipient.
daughter (n.)
A relation between two nodes in a phrase-marker. If one node
X immediately dominates another node Y, then X is the ‘mother’ of Y, and Y
is the ‘daughter’ of X.
daughter-adjunction (n.)
see adjunction
daughter-dependency grammar (DDG)
An approach to grammatical analysis
based on a system of syntactic features and dependency relations, in which
there is a single level of syntactic representation, transformations not
being required. The ‘vertical’ constituency relations between nodes are referred
to in terms of ‘daughter-dependency’; the ‘horizontal’ dependencies (of subject-
verb, etc.) are referred to in terms of ‘sister-dependency’. All nodes in this
approach are complexes of binary features (as opposed to the unitary categor-
ies of earlier models of transformational grammar). Classiﬁcation rules deﬁne
the permissible combinations of features to construct categories; dependency
rules specify the structures in which these categories appear. All constituents are
deﬁned in terms of a notion of relative peripherality: given any two constituents,
one will be more peripheral than the other. A notion of syntactic function
(e.g. subject, topic) is assigned to nodes, whose main function is to determine
surface-structure word-order.

Davidsonian semantics
A theory of semantics proposed by the British philo-
sopher Donald Davidson (1917–2003), which argues that a theory of truth for a
natural language constitutes a theory of meaning for that language. The mean-
ing of any sentence is derivable from axioms which assign semantic properties to
its constituents, and sentence structures are linked by valid inferential relations.
The term neo-Davidsonian is used for a particular approach to the analysis of
thematic roles, in which verbs are regarded as 1-place predicates of events,
and thematic roles are treated as 2-place relations between individuals and
events; sometimes called event semantics. In a neo-Davidsonian analysis, a
sentence such as John hit Bill on the arm would be assigned a logical form
Davidsonian semantics
129

such as ∃(e[hit(e) & agent(e, John) & patient(e, Bill) & location(e, the arm)]),
where ∃ is the existential quantiﬁer (‘there exists one or more members in
the universe . . .’) and e is a special variable over events. The extent to which
sentences can be analysed in terms of event variables is controversial, especially
in view of stative and other types of sentence which do not refer to events.
deadjectival (adj.)
A term used in grammar to describe an element which
originates as an adjective but is used in some other way in sentence structure.
Deadjectival verbs in English (using different formation processes) include wise
up, darken and enlarge; deadjectival nouns include the rich, the old and the
French. See also denominal, deverbal.
death (n.)
see language death
debuccalized (adj.)
A term used in some models of non-linear phonology to
refer to consonants which lack an oral place feature, such as glottal stop
or [h]. The process through which such consonants are formed is called debuc-
calization (also deoralization): examples include [t] > [Æ] and [s] > [h]. See buccal.
declaration (n.)
A term used in the theory of speech acts to refer to a type
of utterance where the speaker’s words bring about a new situation in the
external world, as in I name this ship/child . . . , I resign.
declarative (adj./n.)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of sen-
tence types, and usually seen in contrast to imperative, interrogative, etc. It
refers to verb forms or sentence/clause types typically used in the expression
of statements, e.g. the man is walking. The term ‘indicative’ is also sometimes
used in this sense. See also mood.
declension (n.)
In grammar, a traditional term for a class of nouns, adject-
ives, or pronouns in an inﬂecting language, which occur with the same
range of forms. In Latin, for example, the ‘ﬁrst declension’ refers to nouns
whose endings are -a, -am, or -ae, in the various cases in the singular (e.g.
insula ‘island’, poeta ‘poet’). There are a further four declensions with different
types of ending, as well as several nouns which decline in an irregular way.
The term is not usually found in modern linguistic analysis (which talks in
terms of ‘word-classes’), but will be encountered in studies of linguistic
historiography).

de dicto/de re /de} cd}ktvä, de} cre}/
Terms used in philosophy and logic which
have been invoked in the semantic analysis of sentences expressing such
130
deadjectival

modal meanings as ‘It is possible that . . .’ or ‘X believes that . . .’ De dicto
(Latin: ‘about what is said’) refers to the truth of a proposition, whereas de
re (‘about the thing’) refers to belief in an individual entity. For example, a
sentence such as Jane believes that Michael Brown is a doctor is ambiguous
between the two readings. On a de re reading, the speaker refers to a particular
individual as Michael Brown, and asserts that Jane believes that individual
to be a doctor. The sentence entails that Michael Brown exists, but makes
no claim as to whether Jane knows him by that name. In contrast, on a de
dicto reading, the sentence asserts that Jane stands in the belief relation to
the sentence Michael Brown is a doctor. Hence it requires that Jane
believes there to be someone named Michael Brown, but the sentence taken
as a whole does not entail that such an individual actually exists. See also
opaque (3).

deep structure
A central theoretical term in transformational grammar;
opposed to surface structure. ‘Deep structure’ (or deep grammar) is the
abstract syntactic representation of a sentence – an underlying level of
structural organization which speciﬁes all the factors governing the way the
sentence should be interpreted. (The basic notion has also been referred to,
in various theoretical contexts, as D-structure, underlying structure, base
structure, remote structure and initial structure.) This level provides
information which enables us to distinguish between the alternative interpre-
tations of sentences which have the same surface form (i.e. they are ambigu-
ous), e.g. Flying planes can be dangerous, where ﬂying planes can be related to
two underlying sentences, Planes which ﬂy . . . and To ﬂy planes . . . It is also a
way of relating sentences which have different surface forms but the same
underlying meaning, as in the relationship between active and passive struc-
tures, e.g. The panda chased the man as opposed to The man was chased by the
panda. Transformational grammars would derive one of these alternatives from
the other, or perhaps both from an even more abstract (‘deeper’) underlying
structure. The various grammatical relations in such sentences can then be re-
ferred to as the ‘deep subject’, ‘deep object’, etc. (contrasted with ‘surface
subject’, etc.). It is also possible to compute the ‘depth’ at which a transforma-
tion operates, by referring to the number of stages in a derivation before it
applies, and some attempt has been made to correlate this notion with the
complexity of a sentence.
In some generative studies, the role of deep structure has been called into
question, it being suggested that a separate level of underlying syntactic organiza-
tion between surface structure and meaning is unnecessary and misleading (see
generative semantics). It is also possible to ﬁnd the term used in the general
sense of ‘underlying structural interpretation’, without commitment to a speciﬁc
interpretation in terms of transformational grammar. Indeed, the original use
of this term, by the American linguist Charles Hockett (1916–2000), antedates
its Chomskyan application.
deep structure
131

default (n.)
The application of the general use of this term in several domains
of linguistics and phonetics, to refer to cases where a previously speciﬁed value
is automatically introduced into an analysis when certain conditions apply. In
some models of phonology, for example, it refers to an unmarked mode of
operation of a rule. A case in point is in radical underspeciﬁcation theory,
where for each feature one value (the phonologically active value) is speciﬁed
in the lexical representation, and the other is ﬁlled in at some later stage by a
default rule (DR, or default speciﬁcation) which assigns an unmarked value to
the feature. The default rule may become activated by a phonological rule, or it
may stay passive throughout the derivation. The notion is also important in
morphology, where a particular allomorph can be viewed as a default form
(e.g. the -ed past-tense ending in English) and in some semantic lexical analyses,
such as certain models of typed feature structures.
defective (adj.) (1)
In grammar, a traditional description of words which do
not display all the properties of the class to which they belong. The English
modal verbs, for example, are defective in that they do not permit the usual
range of verb forms, such as an inﬁnitive or participle forms (to may,
shalling, etc.). Because of its pejorative connotations in general usage, the term
needs to be used cautiously. It tends to be avoided in modern linguistic analysis
(which talks more in terms of irregular forms and exceptions to rules), but
will be encountered in studies of linguistic historiography. The distinction
between ‘defective’ and ‘irregular’ needs to be appreciated: a defective form is a
missing form; an irregular form is present, but does not conform to the rule
governing the class to which it belongs.
(2)
In phonology, descriptive of any pattern which fails to show all the pro-
perties of the class to which it belongs. For example, a segment with a ‘defect-
ive distribution’ does not appear in all the environments possible for other
members of its class (e.g. the distribution of English /h/ is defective, compared
with other fricatives, because it cannot appear syllable-ﬁnally).
deﬁcit hypothesis
In sociolinguistics and educational linguistics, the
name given to the view that some children, especially those belonging to an
ethnic minority or with a working-class background, lack a sufﬁciently wide
range of grammatical constructions and vocabulary to be able to express
complex ideas, such as will be needed for success in school. An unfashionable
hypothesis in the intellectual climate of the present day, it is contrasted with the
difference hypothesis – the view that the language used by such children is
simply different from that found in middle-class children, though its social
standing is lower. The difference hypothesis views all dialects as intrinsically
equal and able to express ideas of any complexity, though children who speak
non-standard dialects may not have had the same kind of opportunity or
motivation to use their language in demanding educational contexts.
deﬁning (adj.)
see relative
deﬁning vocabulary
In several areas of applied linguistics, a ﬁxed set of
words used as part of the deﬁnition of other words. The notion is found in such
contexts as foreign-language teaching, the teaching of reading, and lexicography.
132
default

These days, several dictionaries intended for the non-native user have a limited
vocabulary – for example, 2,000 words – in order to deﬁne the meanings of all
their lexical entries.
deﬁnite (adj.) (def, DEF)
A term used in grammar and semantics to refer to
a speciﬁc, identiﬁable entity (or class of entities); it is usually contrasted with
indeﬁnite (less often non-deﬁnite). Deﬁniteness in English is generally con-
veyed through the use of deﬁnite determiners (such as this, my), and especially
through the deﬁnite article, the. Deﬁnite noun phrases are often referred to,
especially in the philosophical linguistic literature, as deﬁnite descriptions.
See also past historic, speciﬁc indeﬁnite.
defooting (n.)
see foot (1)
deforestation (n.)
A principle proposed in generative phonology whereby,
before applying any rules on a phonological cycle, all prosodic structure in
the domain of that cycle is erased. The principle was introduced to handle
words which are subject to processes of derivational morphology due to
afﬁxation (e.g. sensation, sensationality).
degenerate foot
In metrical phonology, a foot containing only one syl-
lable; also described as a unary foot.
degree (n.)
A grammatical category used to specify the extent of a com-
parison between adjectives or adverbs. A three-way contrast of gradation
is usually recognized (positive v. comparative v. superlative), but other
possibilities are sometimes distinguished, e.g. an ‘equative’ degree (seen in
as big as). In English, both morphological and syntactic means are used
in the expression of degree, e.g. bigger/biggest but more fascinating/most
fascinating.
deictic (adj./n.)
see deixis
deixis (n.) /cda}ks}s/
A term used in linguistic theory to subsume those
features of language which refer directly to the personal, temporal or locational
characteristics of the situation within which an utterance takes place, whose
meaning is thus relative to that situation; e.g. now/then, here/there, I/you,
this/that are deictics (‘deictic’ or exophoric words). Deixis is analogous to
the philosophical notion of indexical expression. The term is also used for
words which refer backwards or forwards in discourse (anaphora and
cataphora respectively), e.g. that, the following, the former. This is some-
times known as discourse (or text) deixis, which should be distinguished from
social deixis, the encoding of social distinctions that relate to participant
roles (speaker–addressee, etc.), as encountered in such matters as pron-
ouns, honoriﬁcs, vocatives and forms of address. The notion of deixis has
proved to be fruitful in several areas of linguistics, especially in pragmatics,
and in language acquisition studies, where some investigators view the learn-
ing of these items by children as constituting a signiﬁcant feature of early
development.
deixis
133

delayed (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle (see
Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, as part of
the phrase delayed release (DEL REL), to handle variations in manner of
articulation, specifying the nature of a sound’s release. Delayed release
sounds are deﬁned both articulatorily and acoustically, as those sounds
where a sound is produced with a gradual release sufﬁcient to make a sound
similar to a fricative, as in affricates. Affricates are all [+delayed release]
([+del rel]). Its opposite is instantaneous or abrupt release, referring to a
sound released suddenly and without the acoustic turbulence of a fricative, as
in plosives.
delayed auditory feedback
see feedback
delete (v.)
see deletion
deletion (n.)
A basic operation within the framework of transformational
grammar, which eliminates a constituent of an input phrase-marker. In
classical TG, it accounted for imperative sentences, for example (where the
subject and auxiliary verb of an underlying sentence are deleted, as in kick
the ball from You will kick the ball). Other applications of the notion can be
found in the transformational treatment of dummy symbols, and in several
speciﬁc transformational operations (e.g. equi NP deletion). Several formal
constraints on the use of deletion transformations have been suggested, espe-
cially that the deleted elements must be recoverable, i.e. the deletion transforma-
tion must specify the elements to be deleted, and in the output phrase-marker
the effects of the deletion must be clearly indicated. If this were not the case,
there would be several unfortunate consequences; e.g. a single surface structure
could be related to an indeﬁnite number of deep structures, as in He’s been hit,
derivable from Someone/John/A bullet . . . hit him. See also ellipsis.
delicacy (n.)
In Hallidayan linguistics, a term used to refer to one of the
scales of analysis which interrelate the categories of the theory, viz. the dimen-
sion which recognizes increasing depth of detail. An increasingly delicate ana-
lysis of the notion of clause, for example, might recognize afﬁrmative v.
interrogative types; interrogative clauses could then be analysed into several
question types; and so on. Other scales in this approach are labelled rank and
exponence.
delimitative (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in grammar and semantics,
referring to a limitation on the duration of the state or activity expressed by the
verb (‘for a little while’). In some languages (e.g. Russian) the contrast is a
formal part of the aspect system.
delinking (n.)
see spreading (2), linking (2)
delta (adj./n.)
A symbol ∆ used in some models of transformational gram-
mar (see Aspects model), which acts as a dummy element in the generation of
deep structures. The purpose of the delta symbols is to mark the places in an
initial phrase-marker (a pre-lexical structure) where lexical items are later
134
delayed

to be inserted: lexical insertion rules then replace each ‘empty’ delta by a
complex symbol containing the syntactic features which will be used to
deﬁne the deep structures of the grammar.
demarcative (adj.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to a
feature which marks the boundary of a linguistic unit. The feature does not
have to be coterminous with the boundary: in Welsh, for example, word stress
falls (with few exceptions) on the penultimate syllable of a polysyllabic word,
and therefore has a potentially demarcative function, in that it can be used to
predict the subsequent location of the word boundary.
demibeat (n.)
see beat
demisyllabic (adj.)
A term used in acoustic phonetics for an approach to the
analysis of syllables which recognizes an acoustically identiﬁable unit between
the syllable and the phone. A syllable is decomposed into two elements: a
syllabic core and an optional afﬁx (or afﬁxes). The core is then analysed, on the
basis of a spectrographic or waveform display, into an initial and ﬁnal
demisyllable, corresponding respectively to the initial part of the vowel and
the mid-to-ﬁnal part of the vowel. Because there are fewer demisyllables than
syllables (in English, for example, the demisyllabic inventory is about a ﬁfth of
the syllabic), and because they display a degree of independence and acoustic
stability which facilitates concatenation, this kind of analysis has had applica-
tions in speech synthesis and automatic speech recognition.
demonstrative (adj./n.) (dem, DEM)
A term used in grammar and semantics
to refer to a class of items whose function is to point to an entity in the
situation or elsewhere in a sentence. The items this and that, for example,
have their reference ﬁxed by gestures, speaker knowledge, or other means.
Depending on their grammatical role, they are called ‘demonstrative deter-
miners’ (That book is interesting) or ‘demonstrative pronouns’ (That is
interesting), but some grammars refer to items with determiner function as ‘demon-
strative adjectives’. Demonstratives fall within the general class of deictic
expressions, and are sometimes contrasted with ‘pure indexicals’.
demotic (adj.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to describe a style of language
used for or by ordinary people; usually contrasted with a hieratic style used for
special (e.g. religious) purposes. Examples include the simpliﬁed hieroglyphic of
Ancient Egyptian and the vernacular variety of Modern Greek.
demotion (n.)
A term used in relational grammar for a class of relation-
changing processes in which a noun phrase bearing a particular grammatical
relation to some verb comes to bear another grammatical relation to that verb,
which is lower down the relational hierarchy. An example would be a process
which converted a subject to an object.
denasalized (adj.)
see nasal
denominal (adj.)
A term used in grammar to describe an element which ori-
ginates as a noun but is used in some other way in sentence structure. For
denominal
135

example, in the garden fence, garden could be described as a denominal adject-
ive; in I’m going to carpet the room, carpet is a denominal verb. See also
deadjectival, deverbal.
denotation (n.)
A term used in semantics as part of a classiﬁcation of types of
meaning; often opposed to connotation. It has been given different though
overlapping uses in philosophy and branches of linguistics, so it has to be
used with care. In one sense, in traditional linguistic terminology, denotational
meaning equates roughly with literal meaning, contrasting with the subjective
and personal associations of connotation. For example, the denotation of dog
would be its dictionary deﬁnition of ‘canine quadruped’, etc., while its connota-
tions might include ‘friend’, ‘helper’, ‘competition’, etc. In a second sense, the
denotation of an expression is the set of entities that it properly applies to or
identiﬁes; so for dog this is the set of all actual dogs. In this case it is equivalent
to extension. In a third usage, the denotation of an expression is the set of
properties that something has to have to allow the expression to be applied to it.
In this case it is equivalent to intension. See extension (1), intension (1).
dense neighbourhood
see neighbourhood
dental (adj./n.)
A term in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on
the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made against the
teeth, either by the tongue tip and rims or by the lip. ‘Apico-dental’ is a more
explicit but less used description of the ﬁrst possibility, ‘apico-’ being derived
from apex, an alternative term for tongue tip; ‘labio-dental’ is a common descrip-
tion of the second. Usually the upper teeth are the ones involved, as in the [:],
[>] and [<] of some English dialects, such as Irish English (this contrasts with
the alveolar articulation of [d] and [t] in received pronunciation); but both
upper and lower teeth may be in contact with the tongue during the articulation,
as in the th- sounds of thin [θ] and this [Î]. In [θ] and [Î], moreover, the tip of
the tongue is usually slightly between the teeth, in which cases the more precise
term interdental can be used. If the sound is articulated towards the back of
the upper teeth, close to the alveolar ridge, the term ‘post-dental’ can be used.
‘Denti-alveolar’ identiﬁes the place of articulation at the junction of the upper
teeth and alveolar ridge. The phonetic symbol for ‘dental articulation’ is [o],
placed underneath the symbol for the consonant in question, as above. See also
labio-dental, laminal.
denti-alveolar (adj.)
see dental
deontic (adj.) /de}c∞nt}k/
A term derived from modal logic and used
by some linguists as part of a theoretical framework for the analysis of
modal verbs and related structures in language. Deontic modality is con-
cerned with the logic of obligation and permission, e.g. the use of the modals
in sentences such as The car must be ready, i.e. ‘It is obligatory that the car
be ready’. It thus contrasts with alethic and epistemic modality, which
would interpret this sentence respectively as ‘It is metaphysically necessary for
the car to be ready’ and ‘It follows from what is known that the car is
ready’.

see debuccalized
dependence (n.)
A family of faithfulness constraints in optimality theory
requiring that every feature or segment in the output has an identical corres-
pondent in the input. It is a class of correspondence constraints.
dependency grammar
A type of formal grammar, best known for the devel-
opment it received in the 1950s (in particular, by the French linguist Lucien
Tesnière (1893–1954)), which establishes types of dependencies between the
elements of a construction as a means of explaining grammatical relation-
ships. syntactic structure is represented using dependency trees – sets of
nodes whose interconnections specify structural relations. Every tree contains
a governor and a set of dependents, each of which bears a speciﬁc relation to
the governor. For example, in a clause, the verb is seen as governor, and the
dependents are noun phrases, which are assigned numerical values depending
on the valency attributed to the verb. In a prepositional phrase, such as on
the box, the preposition governs the noun, and the noun governs the article.
Dependencies are usually displayed as arcs, which relate words (rather than
constituents). The statements which specify the governing and dependent
relations which each class of unit may enter into are known as dependency
rules. Dependencies are of particular importance in several grammatical theories
(such as daughter-dependency grammar). The term ‘dependency’ is also
used in several frameworks to express types of relationship between phrases,
e.g. unbounded dependency.
dependency phonology (DP)
An approach to phonology which makes use of
the principles of dependency grammar to set up a model of the internal
relational structure of segments. The syllable is seen as a dependency
structure, with a governor (or head) and dependents (or modiﬁers). A
syllabic element (a vowel or a syllabic consonant) is the minimal obligatory
component of the syllable, other elements being marginal, governed by their
syllabic. Degree of dependency is represented vertically in a dependency graph,
the governor being ‘degree zero’, with other levels ‘degree one’, etc., as in the
graph for cat:
Within the segment, all features are viewed as unary, and are generally referred
to as ‘components’. The notion of dependency has also come to be used by
some other non-linear phonological models to denote any kind of relation
which may be represented asymmetrically, especially with reference to segment-
internal structure. For example, headedness may be seen in the relative
prominence of sequences of strong and weak segments in metrical phono-
logy, or between sonorous and non-sonorous consonants, or between
the elements of a consonant cluster. In feature geometry, the dependency

the classiﬁcation of clause types: opposed to main, and synonymous with
subordinate.
(2)
See dependency grammar.
deponent verb
A term from traditional Latin grammar, used for verbs which
are passive in most of their forms, but active in meaning. Examples include
loquor ‘speak’ and hortor ‘I exhort’. They are called ‘deponent’ because they
have ‘put away’ (de + pono) some of their parts – in other words, the inﬂec-
tions associated with the active voice.
depth (n.)
see deep structure
depth hypothesis
A hypothesis proposed by the American linguist Victor Yngve
(b. 1920) in the early 1960s as an explanation of the psychological differences
between the two categories of linguistic construction: left-branching (e.g.
the man’s hat) and right-branching (e.g. the hat of the man). He argued that
left-branching structures add more to the psychological complexity (or struc-
tural ‘depth’) of a sentence, because the processing of such structures takes up
more space in short-term memory than does the processing of right-branching
structures. The hypothesis has been criticized on various grounds, particular
reference being made to other important types of construction which complicate
the issue, such as self-embedding. The term should be distinguished from
the general sense of ‘depth’ in psycholinguistics, where it is used in relation
to the effect of different levels of processing on the retention of linguistic
information.
de re
see de dicto/de re
derivation (n.) (1)
A term used in morphology to refer to one of the two
main categories or processes of word-formation (derivational morphology),
the other being inﬂection(al); also sometimes called derivatology. These terms
also apply to the two types of afﬁx involved in word-formation. Basically, the
result of a derivational process is a new word (e.g. nation ⇒ national), whereas
the result of an inﬂectional (or non-derivational) process is a different form of
the same word (e.g. nations, nationals). The distinction is not totally clear-cut,
however (e.g. how best to analyse -ly in English). Derivational afﬁxes change the
grammatical class of morphemes to which they are attached (as in sufﬁxation,
e.g. -tion is a noun-forming derivational sufﬁx); they also usually occur closer
to the root morpheme than do inﬂections, e.g. nation-al-ize + -ing/-s/-d. Often
they have independently stateable lexical meanings (e.g. mini-, sub-), though
these are not always easy to identify (e.g. -er). The combination of root and
derivational afﬁxes is usually referred to as the stem of the word, i.e. the
element to which inﬂections are attached; several modes of classiﬁcation are
available in the literature on this subject.
(2)
In generative grammar, derivation refers to the set of formally identiﬁable
stages used in generating a sentence from an initial symbol to a terminal
138
dependent

string, i.e. the whole set of phrase-structure, transformational, etc., rules
which have applied. In a more restricted context, a derived structure refers to
the form of an output phrase-marker, after a transformational rule has applied.
See also correspondence hypothesis.
(3)
In historical linguistics, derivation is used to refer to the origins or
historical development of a language or linguistic form. Sounds, words (see
etymology) and structures are said to be derived from corresponding forms in
an earlier state of a language.

derivatology (n.)
see derivation
derived environment
In some models of phonology, a term used to charac-
terize a constraint on the application of certain phonological rules: the derived
environment constraint or condition asserts that certain kinds of rules (e.g.
obligatory neutralization rules) apply only in derived environments – that
is, derived through either morphological composition or the application of a
phonological rule. The domains which exhibit this constraint are cyclic.
description (n.)
The general sense of this term is found in linguistics, identi-
fying one of the main aims of the subject – to give a comprehensive, systematic,
objective and precise account of the patterns and use of a speciﬁc language or
dialect, at a particular point in time. This deﬁnition suggests several respects in
which descriptive is in contrast with other conceptions of linguistic enquiry. The
emphasis on objectivity, systematicness, etc., places it in contrast with the pre-
scriptive aims of much traditional grammar: the aim of descriptive linguistics
is to describe the facts of linguistic usage as they are, and not how they ought to
be, with reference to some imagined ideal state. The emphasis on a given time
places it in contrast with historical linguistics, where the aim is to demonstrate
linguistic change: descriptive linguistics aims to describe a language synchron-
ically, at a particular time (not necessarily the present – one can describe the
linguistic patterns of any period). The emphasis on ‘a’ language distinguishes
the subject from comparative linguistics, as its name suggests, and also from
general linguistics, where the aim is to make theoretical statements about
language as a whole.
It ought not to be forgotten, of course, that there is an interdependence
between these various branches of the subject: a description is the result of an
analysis, which must in turn be based on a set of theoretical assumptions. But in
descriptive linguistics the theory is only a means to an end, viz. the production
of a descriptive grammar (or one of its subdivisions, e.g. phonology, lexicon,
syntax, morphology). An approach which is characterized by an almost
exclusive concern with description, in the above sense, is known as descriptivism,
and its proponents as descriptivists. In linguistics, the term is usually applied to
American anthropological and structuralist studies before the ‘generativist’
approach of the late 1950s. Within generative grammar, also, the phrase
descriptive adequacy adds a special dimension to the use of the term: it refers to
an account of the native-speaker’s linguistic competence (and not merely to
description
139

an account of a corpus of data, as would be intended by the earlier use of
‘description’).

see description
desiderative (adj./n.)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of
sentence types, and usually seen in contrast to indicative, imperative, etc.,
moods. Desiderative utterances (or ‘desideratives’) refer to verb forms or
sentence/clause types used for the expression of wants and desires – approxim-
ately translatable by ‘I want +sentence’, but often lexicalized, e.g. to want to
eat ⇒ to hunger.
designated terminal element (DTE)
A term used in metrical phonology for
the most prominent element in a string, dominated only by relatively strong
(s-)nodes. For example, egg is the DTE in the phrase the hard-boiled egg.
destressing (n.)
see stress
deterioration (n.)
In historical linguistics, a term used in the classiﬁcation
of types of semantic change, referring to the development of a sense of disap-
proval in a lexical item; also called pejoration, and opposed to amelioration.
An example of the way words deteriorate is notorious, which once meant ‘widely
known’, and now means ‘widely and unfavourably known’.
determiner (n.) (det, DET, D)
A term used in some models of grammatical
description, referring to a class of items whose main role is to co-occur with
nouns to express a wide range of semantic contrasts, such as quantity or
number. The articles, when they occur in a language, are the main subset of
determiners (e.g. the/a in English); other words which can have a determiner
function in English include each/every, this/that, some/any, all of which have a
distribution which includes the article position, e.g. the/this/some . . . cake.
Some linguists extend the application of this term to include other types of
word within the noun phrase (e.g. adjectives, predeterminers), and sometimes
even to include modiﬁers in other parts of the sentence. In some generative
grammar theories, determiner is regarded as the head in combination with a
noun, to produce a determiner phrase (DP). The DP hypothesis is the proposal
that noun phrases are projections of the determiner.
determinism (n.)

development (n.)
see acquisition
developmental linguistics
A term occasionally used for the branch of linguistics
concerned with the study of the acquisition of language in children. The
subject involves the application of linguistic theories and techniques of analysis
to child language data, in order to provide a precise description of patterns of
development and an explanation of the norms and variations encountered, both
140
descriptive adequacy/grammar/linguistics

within individual languages and universally. In relation to the task of explana-
tion, particular attention is paid to the role of non-linguistic factors, such as
cognition, social background, the nature of the experimental task, and so on,
and as a consequence there has been an increasingly multidisciplinary approach
to the problem. Because of the particular relevance of psychological factors, the
subject is more commonly referred to as developmental psycholinguistics.
deverbal (adj.)
A term used in grammar to describe an element which ori-
ginates as a verb but is used in some other way in sentence structure. For
example, in the singing policeman, singing could be described as a deverbal
adjective; in I made a go of it, go is a deverbal noun. See also deadjectival,
denominal.
deviance (n.)
A term used in linguistic analysis to refer to a sentence (or
other unit) which does not conform to the rules of a grammar (i.e. it is ill
formed). Deviant sentences are conventionally marked with an initial asterisk,
e.g. *Is they be going.
device (n.)
A term derived from mathematics and used especially in generative
linguistics to refer to an abstract design speciﬁcally constructed to enable an
analysis to be made. A grammar, in this sense, can be seen as a device for
generating sentences. The notion is sometimes encountered in child language
studies, where, in the Chomskyan view, children are credited with a language
acquisition device (see acquisition) which enables them to work out the
correct grammatical analysis of sentences on the basis of the speech data
presented to them.
devoiced (adj.)
see voice (1)
dia-
A commonly used preﬁx, derived from the term dialect, and used in
linguistic studies whenever a dialectal frame of reference is required.
Dialinguistics is sometimes used to refer to the study of the range of dialects and
languages used in a speech community. A diatype is a term used by some
sociolinguists to refer to a variety of language deﬁned according to its use
or purpose. It thus contrasts with dialect, which is a variety deﬁned in terms
of regional or social groups of users. Alternative terms include variety and
register. A diasystem is a network of formal relationships which shows the
common linguistic system assumed to underlie two or more dialects, as a frame-
work for displaying their structural differences. The notation used for this
purpose includes formulae which display structural correspondence, e.g.
    
X
Y
i ~ 
i
e
a
a ~ e
 
    
÷ ≈
≈
etc., where X and Y are the names of two areas, ~ indicates a contrast which
is relevant for one dialect only, ≈ for two (or more) dialects. Within such a
framework, diasystemic units can be identiﬁed: a diaphone is an abstract
phonological unit set up to identify an equivalence between the sound system
of different dialects, e.g. the diaphone /ei/, as in English mate, is realized as [ei],
dia-
141

[ai] etc.; a diamorph displays equivalences between morphological units;
and so on.
diachronic (adj.)
One of the two main temporal dimensions of linguistic
investigation introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure (see Saussurean), the other
being synchronic. In diachronic linguistics (sometimes called linguistic
diachrony), languages are studied from the point of view of their historical
development – for example, the changes which have taken place between Old
and Modern English could be described in phonological, grammatical and
semantic terms (‘diachronic phonology/syntax/semantics’). An alternative term
is historical linguistics. The earlier study of language in historical terms,
known as comparative philology, does not differ from diachronic linguistics
in subject-matter, but in aims and method. More attention is paid in the latter to
the use of synchronic description as a preliminary to historical study, and to the
implications of historical work for linguistic theory in general.
diacritic (adj./n.) (1)
In phonetics, a mark added to a symbol to alter the way
it is pronounced. Diacritic marks (or ‘diacritics’) include the various accents
(´ ` ^ etc.), and the signs of devoicing [o] and nasalization [~].
(2)
In graphology, the term refers to a mark added to a written symbol which
alters the way the symbol should be pronounced. The mark may be placed over
it, under it, before it, after it, or through it.
(3)
In generative phonology, diacritic features are introduced into the deri-
vation of formatives to account for the apparently exceptional behaviour of
segments. A readjustment rule introduces the feature [D], e.g. to handle the
exceptional stress pattern of words like mómentary (cf. the more regular
eleméntary). [+D] would be inserted ad hoc at an early stage in their derivation.
See also feature.
diagramming (n.)
see parsing (1)
dialect (n.)
A regionally or socially distinctive variety of language, identiﬁed
by a particular set of words and grammatical structures. Spoken dialects
are usually also associated with a distinctive pronunciation, or accent. Any
language with a reasonably large number of speakers will develop dialects,
especially if there are geographical barriers separating groups of people from
each other, or if there are divisions of social class. One dialect may predominate
as the ofﬁcial or standard form of the language, and this is the variety which
may come to be written down.
The distinction between ‘dialect’ and ‘language’ seems obvious: dialects are
subdivisions of languages. What linguistics (and especially sociolinguistics)
has done is to point to the complexity of the relationship between these notions.
It is usually said that people speak different languages when they do not under-
stand each other. But the so-called ‘dialects’ of Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese,
etc.) are mutually unintelligible in their spoken form. (They do, however, share
the same written language, which is the main reason why one talks of them as
‘dialects of Chinese’.) And the opposite situation occurs: Swedes, Norwegians
and Danes are generally able to understand each other, but their separate his-
tories, cultures, literatures and political structures warrant Swedish, Norwegian
and Danish being referred to as different languages.
142
diachronic

The systematic study of all forms of dialect, but especially regional dialect, is
called dialectology, also ‘linguistic geography’ or dialect geography. Traditional
dialectology studies commenced in the late nineteenth century, and have taken
the form of detailed surveys using questionnaires and (more recently) tape-
recorded interviews. Regionally distinctive words (distinct in form, sense or
pronunciation) were the centre of attention, and collections of such words were
plotted on maps and compiled in a dialect atlas (or ‘linguistic atlas’). If a
number of distinctive items all emerged as belonging to a particular area,
then this would be the evidence for saying that a dialect existed. It was often
possible to show where one dialect ended and the next began by plotting the use
of such items, drawing lines around their limits of use (isoglosses), and, where
a ‘bundle’ of such isoglosses fell together, postulating the existence of a dialect
boundary. On one side of the bundle of isoglosses, a large number of word
forms, senses and pronunciations would be used which were systematically
different from the equivalent items used on the other side. Dialect boundaries
are not usually so clear-cut, but the principle works well enough.
Traditional dialectological methods of this kind have more recently been
supplemented by the methods of structural dialectology, which tries to show
the patterns of relationship which link sets of forms from different dialects.
The systems of structural correspondence published by this approach are
known as ‘diasystems’. Dialectometry is a statistical method of dialect analysis,
developed in the 1970s, which measures the linguistic ‘distance’ between local-
ities in a dialect region by counting the number of contrasts in a large sample of
linguistic features.
Perceptual dialectology studies the way dialects, and individual dialect features,
are perceived by speakers within a speech community. Real and imaginary
linguistic differences, stereotypes of popular culture, local strategies of identi-
ﬁcation, and other factors combine to generate a conception of individual
dialects, whose perceptual identities and boundaries may differ signiﬁcantly from
those deﬁned by objective dialect methods. Dialects which identify where a
person is from are called regional dialects, though other terms are used, e.g.
‘local’, ‘territorial’, ‘geographical’. Rural dialects are often distinguished from
urban dialects, the unique complexities of the latter prompting the growth of
urban dialectology.
Dialects which identify where a person is in terms of social scale are called social
dialects or class dialects. More recently, the term sociolect has been used.
Some languages are highly stratiﬁed in terms of social divisions, such as class,
professional status, age and sex, and here major differences in social dialect are
apparent. In English, the differences are not so basic, but it is possible to point
to usages in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation which are socially based,
e.g. ain’t, which has in its time identiﬁed both working-class and upper-class
(e.g. Lord Peter Wimsey) types. Such variants were generally ignored in regional
dialectology, and would these days tend to be studied under the heading of
sociolinguistics. Social dialectology is the application of dialectological methods
to the study of social structure, focusing on group membership as a determinant
of dialectal competence.
‘Dialect’ is also sometimes applied to the linguistically distinct historical stages
through which a language has passed, and here the term historical or temporal
dialect might be used, e.g. Elizabethan English, seventeenth-century British
English. ‘Dialect’ has further been used to refer to the distinctive language of a
dialect
143

particular professional group (occupational dialect), but more recent terms have
come to be used to refer to social variations of this kind (e.g. register, diatype,
variety). The popular application of the term to the unwritten languages of
developing countries (cf. ‘there are many dialects in Africa’, and the like) is not
a usage recommended in linguistics. See also levelling.
dialectalization (n.)
see divergence
dialect atlas

dialect chain
see dialect continuum
dialect continuum
In sociolinguistics, a term used to describe a chain of
dialects spoken throughout an area; also called a dialect chain. At any point in
the chain, speakers of a dialect can understand the speakers of other dialects
who live adjacent to them; but people who live further away may be difﬁcult
or impossible to understand. For example, an extensive continuum links the
modern dialects of German and Dutch, running from Belgium through the
Netherlands, Germany, and Austria to Switzerland. See also post-creole
continuum.

dichotic listening
An experimental technique used in auditory phonetics
to determine which hemisphere of the brain is more, or less, involved in the
processing of speech or other sounds. Listeners are presented simultaneously
with competing stimuli to each ear (e.g. [ba] to one and [ìa] to the other) and
must then report what they hear – in the left ear, in the right ear, or without
specifying which. When the signal to one ear proves to be more accurately or
rapidly reported, it is concluded that the opposite hemisphere is more involved
in its processing.

differential (n.)
see semantic differential
diffuse (adj.) (diff, DIFF)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and
Halle (see Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology,
to handle variations in place of articulation; its opposite is compact. Diffuse
sounds are deﬁned articulatorily and acoustically, as those which involve
a stricture relatively far back in the mouth, and a relatively low concentration
of acoustic energy in non-central parts of the sound spectrum. close vowels
and front consonants are [+diffuse] (abbreviated as [+diff]): mid or low
144
dialectalization

vowels and palatal or velar consonants are [−diffuse] ([−diff]). This feature is
replaced by high in Chomsky and Halle’s system (see Chomskyan).
diffusion (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics and historical linguistics
for the increased use of a language or linguistic form throughout an area over
a period of time. Speciﬁcally, the theory of lexical diffusion explains the way a
sound change moves through the vocabulary of a language, emphasizing that it
spreads differentially and gradually through the words to which it applies, and
not in an ‘across-the-board’ manner at a uniform rate. Some speakers introduce
a change into their speech before others; some use it more frequently and
consistently than others; and some words are affected before others. See also
wave (1).
diglossia (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to a situation where
two very different varieties of a language co-occur throughout a speech
community, each with a distinct range of social function. Both varieties are
standardized to some degree, are felt to be alternatives by native-speakers
and usually have special names. Sociolinguists usually talk in terms of a high (H)
variety and a low (L) variety, corresponding broadly to a difference in formal-
ity: the high variety is learnt in school and tends to be used in church, on radio
programmes, in serious literature, etc., and as a consequence has greater social
prestige; the low variety tends to be used in family conversations, and other
relatively informal settings. Diglossic situations may be found, for example, in
Greek (High: Katharevousa; Low: Dhimotiki), Arabic (High: Classical; Low:
Colloquial), and some varieties of German (H: Hochdeutsch; L: Schweizerdeutsch,
in Switzerland). A situation where three varieties or languages are used with
distinct functions within a community is called triglossia. An example of a
triglossic situation is the use of French, Classical Arabic and Colloquial Tunisian
Arabic in Tunisia, the ﬁrst two being rated H and the last L.
digraph (n.) (1)
A term used in phonetics/phonology and graphetics/grapho-
logy to refer to a graphic unit in which two symbols have combined to
function as a single element in a system, e.g. [æ] for the vowel in received
pronunciation cat, or the linked æ or œ in the classical spelling of some
English words (e.g. encyclopædia, onomatopœia).
(2)
In the study of reading and spelling, digraph refers to any sequence of two
letters pronounced as a single sound. Examples include the ﬁrst two letters of
ship and the middle two letters of wool.
diminutive (adj./n.) (dim, DIM)
A term used in morphology to refer to an
afﬁx with the general meaning of ‘little’, used literally or metaphorically (as a
term of endearment). Examples include -ino in Italian, -zinho in Portuguese, and
-let in English. The term is usually contrasted with augmentative.
ding-dong theory
The name of one of the speculative theories about the origins
of language; it argues that speech arose because people reacted to the stimuli
in the world around them, and spontaneously produced sounds (‘oral gestures’)
which in some way reﬂected the environment. The main evidence is the use of
sound-symbolism (which is, however, very limited in a language). The theory
ding-dong theory
145

has also been called the ta-ta theory – a sceptical reference to the claim that the
way the tongue moves while saying the words ta-ta reﬂects the physical act of
waving goodbye. The term has no standing in contemporary linguistics.
diphthong (n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of vowel sounds
on the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to a vowel where there
is a single (perceptual) noticeable change in quality during a syllable, as in
English beer, time, loud. Related terms are monophthong, where no qualit-
ative change is heard, and triphthong, where two such changes can be heard.
Diphthongs, or ‘gliding vowels’, are usually classiﬁed into phonetic types,
depending on which of the two elements is the more sonorous: ‘falling’ (or
‘descending’) diphthongs have the ﬁrst element stressed, as in the English
examples: ‘rising’ (or ‘ascending’) diphthongs have the second element stressed,
as in a possible analysis of English cue [kiu].
Other classiﬁcations of diphthongal types exist, in terms of the extent of their
movement (e.g. whether it is ‘wide’ or ‘narrow’) and their direction (whether
the diphthong is ‘centring’ or not, i.e. ending with a central vowel). Diph-
thongization is the term used to describe a process where a monophthong has
become a diphthong (has been diphthongized), as in cases of historical or dialect
change. Diphthongs are transcribed using symbols which represent the extremes
of vowel movement between the two positions, as in [a}] for the unit in ﬁne.
diplophonia (n.)
see ventricular
direct (adj.) (1)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to one of the
two types of object element which can function in clause structure, the
other being labelled indirect. The relationship between the two is illustrated
by such sentences as The man gave the boy a book, where a book is the
direct object (What did the man give?) and the boy is the indirect object. The
direct object is the more central in clause structure, indirect objects requiring
a direct object to relate to (cf. *The man gave the boy). This distinction is not
always recognized in linguistic theories: for example, in generative grammar
(especially in relational grammar and lexical functional grammar), the
indirect object without to is regarded as a direct object.
(2)
The opposition between direct and indirect is also used to identify the two
main ways of reﬂecting a person’s speech: direct speech refers to the use of
actual utterance, with no grammatical modiﬁcation, e.g. ‘Is he coming?’
John asked is a direct question, whereas John asked if he was coming is an
indirect question.
(3)
In semantics, direct reference is used for cases where reference is estab-
lished independently of sense. The term has been applied, for example, in the
causal chain theory of proper names.
directional entailingness
see entailment
directionality (n.) (1)
In metrical phonology, a parameter which deter-
mines the direction in which foot construction scans the stress domain. This
may happen right-to-left, starting at the right edge, or vice versa. The notion
applies to both trees and metrical grids.
146
diphthong

(2)
In semantics, directionality describes the relationship between two senses
of a lexical item, when one can be shown to be derived from the other, as
in the case of violin (the instrument) and violin (the player – as in She is ﬁrst
violin). Cases of sense extension generally proceed from the more to the less
conventionalized, but often perceived directionality is unclear.
directive (adj./n.) (1)
In some classiﬁcations of speech acts, an utterance whose
purpose is to get other people to do something for the speaker. The linguistic
means may be grammatical (e.g. commands), semantic (appropriate vocabu-
lary, e.g. please) or phonological (e.g. persuasive intonation patterns).
(2)
A term used in some models of grammatical classiﬁcation to refer
to a type of exocentric construction in which the initial element is referred
to as a director, and the directed element as the axis. For example, in kicked
the ball, kicked is the director, the ball the axis; in in the box, in is the director
(or directive particle), the box is the axis.
disambiguation (n.)
A term used in linguistics, and especially in transforma-
tional grammar, to refer to an analysis which demonstrates the alternative
structural interpretations of an ambiguous sentence, e.g. by assigning
brackets or specifying a transformational relationship. For example, the
sentence The chicken is ready to eat can be disambiguated by showing how
it can be related to such sentences as Someone is ready to eat the chicken and
The chicken is ready to eat something.
discontinuity grammar
see discontinuous (2)
discontinuity hypothesis
see discontinuous (3)
discontinuous (adj.) (1)
A term used by Jakobson and Halle (see Jakobsonian)
in their distinctive feature theory of phonology to refer to sounds pro-
duced with a complete closure of the vocal tract, as in plosives. Its opposite
is continuant, used to characterize fricatives, vowels, etc.
(2)
In grammatical analysis, discontinuity refers to the splitting of a
construction by the insertion of another grammatical unit. Discontinuous
constructions or constituents are illustrated by the way the particle in some
phrasal verbs may be separated from the lexical element, e.g. switch on ⇒
switch the light on, by the double negative system in some languages (French
ne . . . pas, Welsh nid . . . ddim, etc.), or by the separation of auxiliary verb
and main verb in question forms in English (e.g. is he coming?). Some analysts
make use of the notion of a discontinuous morph(eme), as when Arabic root
forms are identiﬁed by the consonants they contain, each of which is separated
by a vowel (e.g. k-t-b ‘write’). A discontinuity grammar is a logic grammar
formalism which allows relationships between widely separated constituents
to be stated within a single grammatical rule; there are several types (e.g. extra-
position grammars, gapping grammars, static discontinuity grammars).
(3)
In language acquisition, the term refers to the view, primarily proposed
by the American linguist Roman Jakobson, that the sounds of babbling bear
no direct relationship to later phonological development. The discontinuity
hypothesis is opposed to the better-supported ‘continuity’ hypothesis, which
discontinuous
147

argues that languages gradually select from the range of sounds used in bab-
bling. The term is also used in child language acquisition (especially in relation
to phonology) to describe a situation where new learning (e.g. acquiring a
new phonological rule) interferes with established ability, causing a temporary
disturbance in the development of speech production.
discourse (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a continuous stretch of
(especially spoken) language larger than a sentence – but, within this broad
notion, several different applications may be found. At its most general, a discourse
is a behavioural unit which has a pre-theoretical status in linguistics: it is a set
of utterances which constitute any recognizable speech event (no reference
being made to its linguistic structuring, if any), e.g. a conversation, a joke,
a sermon, an interview. A classiﬁcation of discourse functions, with particular
reference to type of subject-matter, the situation, and the behaviour of the
speaker, is often carried out in sociolinguistic studies, e.g. distinguishing
dialogues v. monologues, or (more speciﬁcally) oratory, ritual, insults, narrative,
and so on. Several linguists have attempted to discover linguistic regularities in
discourses (discourse analysis or DA), using grammatical, phonological and
semantic criteria (e.g. cohesion, anaphora, inter-sentence connectivity).
Special attention has been focused on discourse markers – sequentially depend-
ent elements which demarcate units of speech, such as oh, well, and I mean.
It is now plain that there exist important linguistic dependencies between sen-
tences, but it is less clear how far these dependencies are sufﬁciently systematic
to enable linguistic units higher than the sentence to be established. The meth-
odology and theoretical orientation of discourse analysis (with its emphasis on
well-formedness and rules governing the sequence of permissible units, in
both spoken and written texts) are often contrasted with those of conversa-
tion analysis. The term discourse grammar has also come to be used by those
seeking to develop an alternative to the generativist conception of an autonom-
ous formal grammar, which would incorporate principles of a functional,
communicative kind.
Some linguists adopt a broader, psycholinguistic perspective in studying dis-
course, which they view as a dynamic process of expression and comprehension
governing the performance of people during linguistic interaction. Some adopt a
sociolinguistic perspective, in which the purpose or function of the discourse is
emphasized. An even broader perspective distinguishes critical discourse ana-
lysis, a branch of critical linguistics which studies the relationship between
discourse events and sociopolitical and cultural factors. These emphases distance
the subject from ‘text linguistics’, when this is seen as the formal account of
 the linguistic principles governing the structure of texts. But there is consider-
able overlap between the domains of discourse analysis and text linguistics
(for example, the notion of cohesion is prominent in both), and any attempt at
a principled distinction would be premature. In semantics, some use is made
of the term universe of discourse (or domain of discourse), viz. the range of
entities, topics, situations, etc., within which a particular speech event makes
reference. In this sense, the universe of discourse of sermons, for example, will
be predictably different (usually) from the universe of discourse of commercial
advertising. See also d-linking, formulaic language, manner (2), mode (1),
tenor.

discourse analysis

discourse attachment
A term used in semantics and discourse analysis
to refer to a process of modelling pragmatic knowledge resources to infer
which rhetorical relations hold between two given discourse constituents.
It represents the rhetorical relations which underlie a text, given the reader’s
background knowledge, in relation to a theory of discourse structure.
discourse deixis
see deixis
discourse in common sense entailment (DICE)
A theory of discourse at-
tachment which uses a logic called ‘common sense entailment’ to handle the
ability to reason with conﬂicting knowledge resources. It supplies a logical
consequence relation for resolving conﬂict among the knowledge resources avail-
able during the interpretation of a discourse, in order to explain how linguistic
strings can be interpreted differently in different discourse contexts.
discourse referent
A term sometimes used in semantic theory, especially in
the study of anaphora, for the representation of an individual at some level
intervening between language and the external world. It is used primarily to
deal with cases in which two or more noun phrases have identical real-
world referents, but produce patterns of anaphora as though they differed
in reference.
discourse representation theory (DAT)
A semantic theory which seeks to extend
model-theoretic semantics to accommodate sequences of sentences, and in
particular to accommodate anaphoric dependencies across sentence bound-
aries. Central to the theory is an intermediate level of semantic representation
called a discourse representation structure (DRS). An initial DRS is derived by
an algorithm from the syntactic structure of sentences. Further rules then
determine how an initial DRS can be enriched to identify various anaphoric
dependencies. Segmented discourse representation theory is an extension of DRT:
it is a semantically based theory of discourse structure which represents the
rhetorical relations that hold between the propositions introduced in a text.
discovery procedure
A term used in linguistics for a set of techniques which
can be automatically or ‘mechanically’ applied to a sample of language and
which will produce a correct grammatical analysis. Attempts to develop such
procedures characterized the work of many Bloomﬁeldian linguists, and were
strongly criticized in early formulations of generative grammar. It is argued
that it is never possible to identify with certainty all the factors which lead a
linguist in the direction of a particular analysis. Nor is it desirable to seek such
a procedure, as the analysis itself can be evaluated regardless of the means by
which it was obtained.
discrete (adj.)
see discreteness
discreteness (n.)
A suggested deﬁning property of human language (contrast-
ing with the properties of other semiotic systems), whereby the elements of a
discreteness
149

signal can be analysed as having deﬁnable boundaries, with no gradation or
continuity between them. A system lacking discreteness is said to be ‘continu-
ous’ or non-discrete (see non-discrete grammar). The term is especially used
in phonetics and phonology to refer to sounds which have relatively clear-cut
boundaries, as deﬁned in acoustic, articulatory or auditory terms. It is
evident that speech is a continuous stream of sound, but speakers of a language
are able to segment this continuum into a ﬁnite number of discrete units, these
usually corresponding to the phonemes of the language. The boundaries of
these units may correspond to identiﬁable acoustic or articulatory features, but
often they do not. The minimal discrete units in phonetics are known as phones.
disharmony, disharmonicity (n.)
see harmony (1)
disjunct (n.)
see disjunction
disjunction (n.)
A term in formal logic now encountered as part of the theoret-
ical framework of several areas in linguistics, especially semantics. It refers
to the process or result of relating two propositions in such a way that they
are in an ‘either-or’ relationship, e.g. (Either) Mary is late or John is early. With
disjunction, it is usual to distinguish inclusive and exclusive interpretations: with
the former, the disjunction is true if either, or both, of the propositions is true;
with the latter, the disjunction is true only if one or other of the propositions is
true (but not both). Under the exclusive interpretation, therefore, the above
disjunction would be false, if both Mary was late and John was early; whereas,
under the inclusive interpretation, the disjunction would be true.
In some grammatical descriptions, the term is adapted to refer to a process
whose primary function is to mark a relationship of contrast or comparison
between structures, using such disjunctive items as or and but. (Some appro-
aches, such as Quirk grammar, use the term disjunct, in a highly restricted
sense, to refer to a subclass of adverbials (such as seriously, frankly, really),
which contrasts with conjuncts, subjuncts and adjuncts on syntactic and
semantic grounds.) The two disjunctions above are often referred to as the
‘exclusive or’ and the ‘inclusive or’. In generative grammar, the notion is
applied as a principle affecting the order of rules. Disjunctive ordering is found
in the use of the parenthesis notation, which indicates optional elements. If
a sequence of rules is abbreviated by using this notion (e.g. X ⇒ Y/Z(P)Q,
which stands for the sequence (a) X ⇒ Y/ZPQ and (b) X ⇒ Y/ZQ), then this
sequence forms a disjunctively ordered block, i.e. if (a) applies, (b) is not per-
mitted to apply. It is distinguished from conjunctive ordering.
dispersion (n.)
In phonetics, a term used to refer to the location of contrast-
ive elements within a phonetic domain (such as the vowel system or tone
system), as part of the comparative study of the size and character of phonetic
inventories. Sounds tend to maximize the available articulatory space so
as to be as different as possible from each other. For example, if a language
has a three-vowel system, a principle of maximal dispersion would predict
that the vowels would be those furthest away from each other in terms of the
back–front and high–low dimensions: /i/, /a/, and /u/. In a language with more
vowels, the ‘extra’ vowels would position themselves at intermediate points.

disharmony

Other factors have to be recognized to handle systems which do not work with
their elements separated in such a symmetrical way.
displaced articulation
In phonetics, an articulation in which the active
articulator moves away from its neutral position. An example is labio-dental
[f], where the lower lip is displaced, being retracted to approach the upper
incisors. By contrast, a bilabial articulation is a neutral articulation, since the
upper and lower lips need not move from their normal position to make the
sound.
displaced speech
see displacement
displacement (n.)
A suggested deﬁning property of human language (contrast-
ing with the properties of many other semiotic systems), whereby language can
be used to refer to contexts removed from the immediate situation of the
speaker (i.e. it can be displaced). For example, if someone says I was afraid, it is
not necessary that the speaker still is afraid, whereas animal calls seem generally
tied to speciﬁc situations, such as danger or hunger, and have nothing compar-
able to displaced speech (unless this is artiﬁcially taught to them, as some experi-
ments with chimpanzees have tried to do).
dissimilation (n.)
A general term in phonetics and phonology to refer to the
inﬂuence exercised by one sound segment upon the articulation of another,
so that the sounds become less alike, or different. Such changes have mainly
been noticed in historical linguistic studies, where the effects have mani-
fested themselves over a long period of time (e.g. pilgrim from Latin peregrinus,
with the ﬁrst r ‘dissimilating’ to l), but synchronic dissimilations are also
possible, as when we avoid a sequence of identical sounds (cf. the difﬁculty of
tongue-twisters such as Will will willingly . . . ). As with the opposite effect,
assimilation, it is possible to classify dissimilations into types, based on the
place, degree and direction of the changes involved.
distance assimilation

distinctiveness (n.)
A term used in linguistics for any feature of speech (or
writing) which enables a contrast to be made between phonological, gram-
matical or semantic units. Such contrasts might also be labelled ‘relevant’,
functional or signiﬁcant. The main use of the term has been in phonology, as
part of the phrase distinctive feature, where it refers to a minimal contrastive
unit recognized by some linguists as a means of explaining how the sound
system of languages is organized. Distinctive features may be seen either as part
of the deﬁnition of phonemes, or as an alternative to the notion of the pho-
neme. The ﬁrst of these views is found in the approach of the Prague School,
where the phoneme is seen as a bundle of phonetic distinctive features: the
English phoneme /p/, for example, can be seen as the result of the combination
of the features of bilabial, voice, plosive, etc. Other phonemes will differ
from /p/ in respect of at least one of these features. In distinctive feature theories
of phonology, however, the phoneme is not considered to be a relevant unit of
explanation: symbols such as p, b, etc., are seen simply as convenient abbreviations
distinctiveness
151

for particular sets of features. It is the features which are the minimal units of
phonological analysis, not the phonemes. It is argued that, by substituting features
for phonemes in this way, generalizations can be made about the relationships
between sounds in a language, which would otherwise be missed. Moreover,
because features are phonetic units, it should be possible to make inter-language
(e.g. diachronic and dialectal) and cross-language comparisons, and ultimately
statements about phonological universals, more readily than by using a phone-
mic model of phonology.
Distinctive feature analysts claim that there are several advantages over the
traditional phonetic alphabet approach to phonological description, which
describes utterances as a sequence of segments. For example, it was origin-
ally suggested that a relatively small set of abstract feature oppositions (a
dozen or so) would account for all the phonological contrasts made in lan-
guages: it would not then be necessary to recognize so much phonetic classiﬁcatory
detail as exists on, say, the IPA chart, where the phonological status of the
segments recognized is not indicated. In fact, it has turned out that far more
features are required, as new languages come to be analysed. Another advan-
tage, it is suggested, is that consonants and vowels can be characterized using
the same set of phonetic features (unlike traditional ‘two-mouth’ descriptions,
where the classiﬁcatory terminology for vowels – high, low, etc. –  is quite
different from that used for consonants – labial, palatal, etc.).
By using a system of this kind, some quite speciﬁc predictions can be made
about the sound systems of languages. For example, using the Jakobson and
Halle system below enables one to distinguish phonologically two degrees of
front/back contrast in the consonant system and three degrees of vowel height.
But what follows from this is a universal claim – that no languages permit
more than these numbers of contrasts in their phonological systems. These are
empirical claims, of course, and in recent years much effort has been spent on
investigating these claims and modifying the nature of the feature inventory
required.
Two major statements concerning the distinctive feature approach were inﬂu-
ential: one by Roman Jakobson and Morris Halle, in Fundamentals of Language
(1956), the other by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle, in The Sound Pattern
of English (1968). The Jakobson and Halle approach set up features in pairs,
deﬁned primarily in acoustic terms (as could be detected on a spectrogram),
but with some reference to articulatory criteria. Examples of their features
include vocalic v. non-vocalic, consonantal v. non-consonantal, compact v.
diffuse, grave v. acute, nasal v. oral, discontinuous v. continuant, strid-
ent v. mellow, ﬂat v. sharp/plain and voiced v. voiceless. The emphasis
in this approach is ﬁrmly on the nature of the oppositions between the under-
lying features involved, rather than on the description of the range of phonetic
realizations each feature represents. In the Chomsky and Halle approach,
more attention is paid to the phonetic realizations of the underlying features
recognized, and a different system of feature classiﬁcation is set up. Some of the
earlier features are retained (e.g. voice, consonantal, tense, continuant, nasal,
strident), but many are modiﬁed, and new features added, some of which
overlap with the earlier approach (e.g. sonorant v. obstruent, delayed v.
instantaneous release, anterior v. non-anterior, coronal v. non-coronal,
distributed v. non-distributed, syllabic v. non-syllabic). The application of
152
distinctiveness

these features to languages is not without controversy, and in recent years
further suggestions have been forthcoming as to the need for additional features,
such as labial. See also Chomskyan, Jakobsonian.
In recent phonological theory, features have become a focus of attention in
their own right, and are widely viewed as the basic unit of phonological
representation. The merits of unary (single-valued) as opposed to binary
analyses have been presented by some models (e.g. dependency phonology).
In addition to questions of feature identiﬁcation and deﬁnition, however, recent
research has focused on the nature of feature organization within phonological
representations, as part of non-linear phonology. In particular, feature
geometry looks especially at the non-linear relationship between features, and at
the way they can be grouped into a hierarchical array of functional classes.
Several formalisms have been devised to handle the relationships between fea-
tures in particular phonological contexts, and terminology has begun to develop
accordingly. For example, in the study of assimilation, a rule which spreads
only features not already speciﬁed in the target is said to be operating in a
feature-ﬁlling mode; if the rule applies to segments already speciﬁed for the
spreading features (thereby replacing their original values), it is said to apply in
a feature-changing mode.
distinguisher (n.)
A term used in early generative linguistics as part of a
(controversial) two-way classiﬁcation of the semantic components of lexical
items. ‘Distinguishers’ were said to be those components which are needed to
keep apart the different meanings of homonyms, but which are unsystematic in
a language; that is, they have no general role to play in the statement of
selectional and other restrictions. For example, in one of the items originally
analysed in this way, bachelor, one distinguisher is the component [having the
academic degree conferred . . . ]. Components which do operate systematically
(e.g. [old], [male], [animate]) were known as markers.
distributed (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle
(see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology to handle
variations in place of articulation (cavity features) in fricative sounds.
Distributed sounds are deﬁned articulatorily, as those produced with a
stricture which extends for a considerable distance along the direction of
the airﬂow, as in bilabial and palato-alveolar fricatives. Its opposite is
non-distributed, referring to sounds produced with a relatively short stricture, as
in dental and retroﬂex fricatives.
distributed morphology (DM)
An approach to morphology proposed in the
early 1990s by MIT linguists Morris Halle and Alec Marantz, in which mor-
phological processes are not localized within a single component (such as the
lexicon) but are ‘distributed’ throughout the grammar, involving syntactic
as well as phonological operations. Vocabulary insertion takes place at a level
of morphological structure (MS) between s-structure and phonological form.
The approach can be contrasted with models which make a clear division
between lexical and syntactic operations, and with associated notions such as
the distinction between derivational and inﬂectional morphology.
distributed morphology

distributed representation
see connectionism
distribution (n.)
A general term used in linguistics to refer to the total set of
linguistic contexts, or environments, in which a unit (such as a phoneme, a
morpheme or a word) can occur. Every linguistic unit, it is said, has a charac-
teristic distribution. A distributional analysis would plot the places in larger
linguistic units where smaller units occur, such as the distribution of phonemes
within a syllable or word, or of words within a sentence. Distributional ideas
were originally developed in phonology, but were later extended to other
linguistic units. In some approaches, the notion of distribution became a major
explanatory principle, being seen as a possible way of grouping sounds into
phonemes without reference to the meaning or grammatical properties of the
words in which they appear – or even to the phonetic similarities existing
between them. On this basis, for instance, [h] and [º] in English might be con-
sidered members of the same phoneme, because they never share the same set
of environments. In phonemic phonology, the most important continuing use of
the term is in the phrase complementary distribution, which refers to the status
of related sounds (or allophones) when they are found in mutually exclusive
environments, as in the use of a dental v. an alveolar allophone of /t/ in
English, e.g. eight v. eighth. (In generative phonology, on the other hand,
distributional statements of this kind are handled by a formulation in terms of
phonological rules.)
distributive (adj./n.) (dist, DIST)
A term used in semantics for predicates or
quantiﬁers which ascribe a property or action to the individual members of a
group, as opposed to the group as a whole; it contrasts with collective. For
example, be asleep is a distributive predicate: The children are asleep entails
that each individual child is asleep (or nearly all of them). In contrast, assemble
(in its intransitive sense) is a collective predicate: The children assembled in
the playground means that the group as a whole assembled; an individual child
cannot assemble.
disyllable (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to a unit,
tpically a word, consisting of two syllables, such as happy and often; it
contrasts with monosyllable and trisyllable. A disyllabic form is distinguished
from monosyllabic and trisyllabic forms.
ditransitive (adj.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to a verb which can
take two objects, e.g. give (I gave him a book). It is usually distinguished from
‘monotransitive’ verbs, such as kick.
divergence (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to a process of
dialect change in which the dialects become less like each other (or diverge).
This process (sometimes called ‘dialectalization’) is only likely to happen in
the absence of geographical and social links between populations within a
speech community, lines of communication thereby being few or difﬁcult, and a
standard dialect probably being non-existent. The opposite effect is known as
convergence. ‘Divergence’ also has a currency in historical linguistic studies,
referring to the splitting of a form into two contrastive units.

distributed representation

D-linking (n.)
In government-binding theory, an abbreviation for discourse-
linking, a notion introduced to account for apparent island violations affecting
certain WH-phrases (as in What did which man buy? v. *What did who buy?)
which are assumed not to move in logical form. Wh-phrases with which are
called D-linked: these presuppose that the answer is picked from a set with
a ﬁxed number of members, and they display properties different from other
wh-phrases – for example, superiority violations are suppressed with D-linked
wh-questions, as in What did which man buy? v. *What did who buy? D-
linked wh-phrases are typically which-phrases; sometimes argument wh-phrases
such as who or what can be D-linked; but adjuncts cannot be D-linked.
docking (n.)
see ﬂoating (1)
do-deletion/insertion/support
A set of rules in generative syntax which
determine the use of the empty auxiliary verb do. ‘Do-insertion’ or ‘do-
support’ inserts the verb do into a place in a structure, as part of the deriva-
tion of a sentence. An example is in some types of tag questions, where to
form a tag from the sentence It wants cleaning a do needs to be introduced,
viz. . . . doesn’t it. It is primarily used where a tense-marker has no verb form-
ative to attach to, as with tense variation in question forms (e.g. did X happen).
‘Do-deletion’ would apply if a do form previously generated by the rules for a
given sentence were to be deleted.
domain (n.) (1)
An extension of the general meaning of this word by some
linguists to refer to the realm of application of any linguistic construct, e.g. the
‘domain’ of a rule in a grammar would refer to the range of structures
to which that rule was applicable. In generative linguistics, the term refers
speciﬁcally to the parts of a tree diagram deriving from any one node, i.e. the
structure which the node dominates. There are several applications, e.g.
the ‘cyclic domain’ in phonology (i.e. the constituents internal to the word to
which phonological rules apply); the ‘harmonic domain’ in vowel or consonant
harmony.
(2)
Domain is sometimes used in semantics to refer to the area of experience
covered by the set of terms in a particular semantic ﬁeld, e.g. colour terms,
kinship terms. See also discourse.
(3)
In sociolinguistics domain refers to a group of institutionalized social
situations typically constrained by a common set of behavioural rules, e.g. the
domain of the family is the house, of religion is the church, etc. The notion is
seen as of particular importance in the analysis of multilingual settings
involving several participants, where it is used to relate variations in the
individuals’ choice and topic of language to broader sociocultural norms and
expectations of interaction.
dominance (n.), dominate (v.)
see domination (1) (2)
domination (n.) (1)
A term in generative linguistics for one type of vertical
relationship between nodes in a tree diagram (‘X dominates Y’). If no nodes
intervene between X and Y, one says that X ‘directly’ or ‘immediately’ domin-
ates Y. For example, in the diagram of the sentence The king saw the cat the D
domination
155

and N are directly dominated by NP, the ﬁrst NP is directly dominated by
‘Sentence’, and the second by the VP. It is by the use of this notion that
distinctions such as subject and object can be made in this model, viz. the
Subject is that NP directly dominated by Sentence, the Object is that NP directly
dominated by VP. A further notion is that of ‘exhaustive’ dominance: a node A
exhaustively dominates a string of words if and only if it dominates those words
and no other words. A node A is also said to exhaustively dominate a node B if
it immediately dominates B and no other node. The ‘vertical’ dimension of
dominance should be distinguished from the ‘horizontal’ notion of precedence.
Immediate-dominance rules are one of the components of a generalized phrase-
structure grammar.
156
donkey sentence
(2)
Dominance is also important in several models of phonology: for exam-
ple, in later metrical phonology foot dominance is a parameter which
determines the side of the foot where the head is located: in ‘left-dominant’
feet, all left nodes are dominant and right nodes recessive; in ‘right-dominant’
feet all right nodes are dominant and left nodes recessive.
(3)
In the phonological analysis of sign language, dominance is used to char-
acterize handedness (deriving from its general use in psychology and neurology):
a signer is linguistically either left-hand or right-hand dominant, depending on
which hand typically executes one-handed signs.
donkey sentence
A type of problematic sentence, typically illustrated by Every
man who owns a donkey beats it, in which the pronoun must be construed as
dependent upon the noun phrase a donkey, without allowing that phrase to
have wider scope than the universal quantiﬁcation expressed by every. Such
sentences have been given detailed study in discourse representation theory.
dorsal (adj.)
A term sometimes used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech
sounds, referring to a sound made with the back, or dorsum, of the tongue in
contact with the roof of the mouth, as in velar (sc. dorso-velar) or palatal (sc.
dorso-palatal) sounds. Some authors include other parts of the tongue under this
heading. The term has developed a special status in phonological theory,
especially in various non-linear models. For example, in articulator-based
feature theory, it refers to a single-valued node involving the tongue body as
Sentence

an active articulator. In constriction-based models, it is deﬁned as a constric-
tion formed by the back of the tongue.

double articulation

double-bar (adj./n.)
In the most widely assumed version of X-bar syntax, a
term describing a full phrasal category (the maximal projection of a zero-
level category). It is distinguished from a single-bar category, which is a ‘small’
phrasal category.
double-bar juncture, double-cross juncture
see juncture (1)
double-base (adj.)
A type of transformational rule recognized in early
models of generative grammar, where the rule operates with an input of two
or more terminal strings. Double-base transformations are also known as
generalized transformations, and are opposed to ‘single-base’ types, where
only one string is involved.
double cross
see hash
double negative
see negation
doublet (n.)
In historical linguistics, a term used for a pair of different
words in a language which have a common origin and display similarities of
form and meaning. English examples are wine/vine and poison/potion.
doubly ﬁlled COMP ﬁlter
A ﬁlter proposed within extended standard
theory to rule out such sentences as *I wonder who that John saw, in which
two items (who and that) occupy the comp position.
downdrift (n.)
see downstep
downgrading (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to a grammatical
process in which a unit in the grammatical hierarchy is embedded within a
unit from a lower level. For example, the clause I don’t care is used as the
equivalent of a word in the sentence That’s a very I-don’t-care attitude; it has
thus been downgraded (compare the notion of rank shift).
downstep (n.)
A term used in the phonology of tone languages, referring to
a lowering process which applies to the second of two high-tone syllables. A
downstepped high tone would be slightly lower than the preceding high tone,
but not so low as to be equivalent to a low tone. The process has been widely
observed in African languages. Less commonly, the opposite effect, upstep, has
been noted, where successive high tones become progressively higher. Downstep
is phonologically contrastive, and is usually distinguished from downdrift, a
sequential process whereby high tones after low tones become progressively less
high throughout an intonational unit. These effects have been described more
downstep
157

generally as ‘register lowering’ or ‘key lowering’. Declination is often used as
an equivalent for downdrift, but this term also has a more general phonetic use
(‘F0 declination’), referring to a gradual descent of pitch level and narrowing of
pitch range throughout an utterance, partly as a result of reduction in subglottal
air pressure, as speakers use up the breath in their lungs. Such effects, of course,
are not restricted to tone languages.
downward entailing

drag chain

drill (n.)
see pattern
drum language
In linguistics, a term used to characterize a type of language
in which a drum is used to simulate selected features of speech (primarily, tones
and rhythms). The signals consist mainly of short, formulaic utterances, but
are used to build up quite elaborate systems of communication, especially in
Africa, both within villages and between communities.
D-structure (n.)
A term used in later transformational grammar to refer to
an alternative conception of deep structure, which is related to S-structure
(surface structure) by the move alpha rule. D-structure is assumed to be a
pure representation of thematic structure. Since move alpha has not applied,
D-structure can contain (big) pro, but not traces.
dual (adj.)
see number
dualism (n.)
A term used to characterize a theory of meaning which postulates
that there is a direct, two-way relationship between linguistic forms and the
entities, states of affairs, etc., to which they refer (i.e. referents). Such dualist
theories are usually contrasted with triadic theories of meaning, which postu-
late a threefold relationship, namely between forms, referents and sense.
duality
A suggested deﬁning property of human language (contrasting with
the properties of other semiotic systems), which sees languages as being struc-
turally organized in terms of two abstract levels; also called duality of
patterning or duality of structure. At the ﬁrst, higher level, language is analysed
in terms of combinations of (meaningful) units (such as morphemes, words);
at another, lower level, it is seen as a sequence of segments which lack any
meaning in themselves, but which combine to form units of meaning. These
two levels are sometimes referred to as articulations – a ‘primary’ and ‘sec-
ondary’ articulation respectively.
dummy (adj./n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a formal grammat-
ical element introduced into a structure or an analysis to ensure that a
grammatical sentence is produced. Apart from their formal role, dummy ele-
ments have no meaning – they are semantically empty, e.g. there in there were
many people at the club, it in it’s raining. When this element acts as a locus for
grammatical contrasts, it is referred to as a dummy carrier, e.g. do in question
158
downward entailing

forms is a dummy auxiliary, which carries the tense/number contrast for the
verb phrase (do/did you know, do/does he know). Notions involving zero
(e.g. ‘zero morpheme’) could also be considered types of dummy. In transforma-
tional grammar, dummy symbols are sometimes introduced into the deep
structure of a sentence, to facilitate the derivation of classes of sentence,
but they never appear in the sentence’s surface structure, e.g. the various kinds
of boundary symbol, or the delta (∆) symbol which acts as a ‘place-holder’
for lexical items (speciﬁed as complex symbols). In government-binding
theory, the term refers to elements in A-position (usually in subject position)
with no theta role; they are also known as ‘expletives’.
duplex perception
An experimental technique used in auditory phonetics
involving the manipulation of two components of a sound stimulus, one in each
ear. In one ear, listeners are presented with a synthesized stop+vowel syllable
(such as [ìa]) from which the second or third formant transition has been
removed; this transition formant is simultaneously presented to the other ear.
People typically perceive a complete [ìa] as well as the isolated transition, which
sounds like a non-speech ‘chirp’. The perception is said to be ‘duplex’ because of
the double effect: listeners hear both the integrated percept and the isolated
transition percept.
duration (n.)
A term used in phonetics, to refer to the length of time involved
in the articulation of a sound or syllable. Distinctions between relatively
‘long’ and relatively ‘short’ durations are measured in units of time, such as the
millisecond (msec). In speech, the absolute duration of sounds is dependent to a
considerable extent on the overall tempo of speaking. Issues which need refer-
ence to duration include the study of rhythm (see isochrony), consonant
articulation (see voice-onset time), and juncture.
durative (adj./n.) (dur, DUR)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of
aspect, to refer to an event involving a period of time (see continuous, pro-
gressive); it contrasts with ‘non-durative’ or punctual. A verb-form is said to
express ‘durative meaning’, or durativity.
dvandva (adj.)
In grammar, a Sanskrit term describing a type of compound
where the elements exist in a co-ordinate relationship (see co-ordination),
lacking any internal dependency; also called a copulative compound. Examples
include the Franco-German pact and the London-Edinburgh express, as well as
extended structures such as Polonius’s tragical-comical-historical-pastoral (Hamlet
II.ii.396).
dyadic (adj.)
see valency
dynamic (adj.) (1)
A term used in grammatical classiﬁcation, referring to one
of the two main aspectual categories of verb use; the other is stative or
static. The distinguishing criteria are mainly syntactic; for example, dynamic
verbs occur in the progressive form (e.g. I’m running, He’s playing) and in the
imperative (e.g. Run!). The semantics of this class covers a wide range, including
activity, process (e.g. change, grow), bodily sensation (e.g. feel, hurt), etc.
dynamic
159

(2)
A term used by some sociolinguists to characterize a view of language
(dynamic linguistics) in which a temporal dimension is introduced into the study
of language variation: synchronic states are seen in terms of the processes
(‘waves’) of change which produce and affect them, as deﬁned in terms of
such notions as relative rate and direction of change. A similar introduction of
the temporal dimension into an otherwise ‘static’ view of a subject is found
in parametric phonetics (dynamic phonetics), and in several contemporary
instrumental techniques for the study of articulation, as in myodynamic (mus-
cular movement) and aerodynamic (airﬂow) investigations (see articulatory
dynamics). Phonological approaches which incorporate parametric phonetic
principles are characterized as dynamic phonology.
(3)
Dynamic is sometimes used in phonology for a tone which varies in
pitch range, e.g. rising or falling. Dynamic tones are usually contrasted with
static tones.
(4)
Dynamic is used in functional sentence perspective, as part of the
phrase communicative dynamism, whereby an utterance is seen as a process of
gradually unfolding meaning, in which each part contributes variously (dynam-
ically) to the total communicative effect. See communicative dynamism.
(5)
Dynamic has been used to describe a formal approach to semantics which
characterizes the meaning of a sentence as its potential to change information
states in a language user (dynamic semantics). It is opposed to a ‘static’ model,
in which meaning is viewed as equivalent to the truth conditional content of
sentences. An information state is seen as a set of possibilities – an encoding of
information about the possible denotations of the expressions of the language
and about the possible values of variables used in these expressions (anaphora).
These states are used to deﬁne the information change potential of expressions –
the change which is brought about by the utterance of a sentence. The analysis
explicates the continuous process of updating interpretations, as information
states come to be extended through the addition of new discourse information
and the elimination of certain possibilities, and as a result the approach is also
referred to as update semantics. The approach has been particularly used in
explicating pronoun co-reference and presupposition.

ear-training (n.)
A technique used in phonetics whereby aspiring practitioners
of the subject are trained to discriminate and identify the whole range of human
speech sounds. The correlative technique of producing the sounds is known as
performance.
Ebonics (n.)
The name given to African-American vernacular English when
given the status of a language distinct from standard English; derived from
ebony + phonics. Although the name was coined as early as 1973, it did not
become widely known until December 1996, when the local school board in
Oakland, California, concerned about the low level of achievement among the
African-American children in its care, and anxious to increase the respect for the
language the children used at home, decided to give the variety ofﬁcial status –
the ﬁrst school district in the USA to do so. The decision proved to be enor-
mously controversial, among both black and white populations, and was dropped
a month later.
echo (n.)
A term used in some grammatical descriptions, notably Quirk
grammar, to refer to a type of sentence which repeats, in whole or in part,
what has just been said by another speaker. Such echo utterances include ‘echo
questions’ (e.g. A: I saw a ghost. B: You saw what?) and exclamations (e.g.
A: Have you been to the ofﬁce? B: Have I been to the ofﬁce!). Questions which
do not echo in this way are sometimes referred to as non-echo questions.
eclecticism (n.)
The application of this general term in linguistics is found
mainly in relation to models of description which have been built from a
combination of features originating in more than one linguistic theory. For
example, Quirk grammar is eclectic in that it makes use of concepts and pro-
cedures deriving from structuralist, transformational and other approaches.
Eclectic accounts are justiﬁed by the multiple insights they can provide into an
area of language. Their main weakness is the difﬁculty of developing a coherent
theoretical framework within which the various descriptive components can
be interrelated.
ecolinguistics (n.)
In linguistics, an emphasis – reﬂecting the notion of eco-

cultural environment is seen as central; also called the ecology of language,
ecological linguistics, and sometimes green linguistics. An ecolinguistic approach
highlights the value of linguistic diversity in the world, the importance of indi-
vidual and community linguistic rights, and the role of language attitudes,
language awareness, language variety, and language change in fostering a
culture of communicative peace.

economy (n.)
A criterion in linguistics which requires that, other things
being equal, an analysis should aim to be as short and use as few terms as
possible. It is a measure which permits one to quantify the number of formal
constructs (symbols, rules, etc.) used in arriving at a solution to a problem, and
has been used, explicitly or implicitly, in most areas of linguistic investigation.
This application of Occam’s razor (‘entities should not be multiplied beyond
necessity’) was a major feature of the proposals for evaluating analyses made
by early generative grammar (see explanatory adequacy). In generative
phonology it has been claimed that the preferred analysis is one which is
overall the more economical, i.e. it uses fewer features and rules. On the other
hand, it has been argued that it will not always be the case that the simpler
solution, in this quantitative sense, will be the intuitively more acceptable one,
or the one which allows the most informative linguistically signiﬁcant
generalizations to be made. In the minimalist programme, several economy
principles are introduced as a means of evaluating derivations. These principles,
such as last resort, least effort, and shortest move, compare deriva-
tions involving the same lexical resources, and discard all but the most econom-
ical derivations.
Linguistic economy is a difﬁcult criterion to work with: simpliﬁcation made
in one part of an analysis may cause difﬁculties elsewhere. And, until a total
description is made, any suggestions concerning economy are necessarily tent-
ative. But generative theory argues that this notion is of major theoretical
importance, and several attempts have been made to provide a formal account
of what is involved in it, as in the notion of a simplicity metric.
A simple example of relative economy of statement can be found in the
opening rules of a generative grammar, if one were to make these apply in a
linear order:
(1)
S → NP + VP
(2)
V → V + NP
(3)
NP → Det + N
A reason for this particular ordering becomes clear when one considers what
would have happened had rule (3) been used before rule (2): the NP in rule (3)
would then rewrite that introduced in rule (1), and the NP in rule (2) would
still need to be expanded, thus requiring an additional rule (4), as follows (with
subscripts added, for clarity):
(1)
S → NP1 + VP
(2)
NP1 → Det + N
(3)
VP → V + NP2
(4)
NP2 → Det + N
The ﬁrst ordering would thus seem to be superior, in terms of economy.

ecological linguistics

-ed form
A term used in English grammatical description to refer to the
simple past-tense form of the verb, e.g. I walked, she jumped. The verb does
not necessarily have this ending (e.g. I ran, she saw); -ed should be seen solely as
a mnemonic device, useful mainly in writing rules succinctly. The -ed ending is,
however, also a common form of the past participle (e.g. she has walked), and
the potential ambiguity has to be borne in mind.
edge (n.) (1)
In some models of non-linear phonology, the everyday sense
of this term is used to identify phonological effects which apply at the margins
of a linguistic unit, such as at the beginning or end of a word or syllable. For
example, some models talk about edge effects, where a given segment behaves
as though it bears the feature [+F] with regard to segments on one side and
[−F] with regard to those on the other side, as in the case of pre-nasalized
stops. Segments which do not display these effects are then said to show ‘anti-
edge effects’, as in the analysis of affricates, which behave as stops with
respect to following segments and/or as fricatives with respect to preceding
segments. The edge-marking parameter is cited in some approaches to metrical
structure: this places a parenthesis at one edge of a sequence of marks (a left
parenthesis to the left of the leftmost element in a string, or a right parenthesis
to the right of the rightmost element). The phrase edge prominence constraint
states that an edge constituent will be more prominent than that of a consti-
tuent not located at an edge. In the analysis of reduplication in prosodic
morphology, phonological constraints suggest that the two components (the
base form and the reduplicant) must share an edge element – initial in preﬁx-
ing reduplication, and ﬁnal in sufﬁxing reduplication.
(2)
In later versions of the minimalist programme, those parts of a phase
which allow syntactic operations to apply. A derivation proceeds phase by
phase, and once it has reached a higher phase, a lower phase becomes inaccess-
ible. However, elements on the edge of the lower phase (such as speciﬁers)
remain accessible. The phase edge has been described as an ‘escape hatch’ through
which elements can be accessed.

educational linguistics
A term sometimes used for the application of linguistic
theories, methods and descriptive ﬁndings to the study of the teaching/learning
of a native language, in both spoken and written forms, in schools or other
educational settings; more broadly, to all teaching contexts; also called pedago-
gical linguistics and sometimes language pedagogy. Speciﬁc topics of interest
include the study of reading and writing, accent and dialect, oracy (see oral),
language variety across the curriculum, and the teaching of linguistics, gram-
mar, etc. in schools.
egocentric speech
In child language acquisition, speech which does not
take into account the needs of the listener, but is used for such purposes as self-
expression and language play. The notion was introduced by Swiss psychologist
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) and elaborated by Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky
(1896–1934) as part of a basic classiﬁcation of types of speech observed
in young children; it contrasts with the socialized speech which is used for
communication with others.
egocentric speech

egressive (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds,
referring to all sounds produced using an outwards-moving airstream mech-
anism. The opposite category is ingressive, which is an uncommon mode for
speech production. The vast majority of speech sounds are made with egressive
air from the lungs (pulmonic air). A few consonants are produced using an
egressive airﬂow originating at the larynx: these are known as ejective or
‘glottalic’ sounds (see glottal), such as [t’, s’, Ä’].
ejective (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their manner of articulation; it refers to the series of sounds
produced by using the glottalic airstream mechanism. Air is compressed in the
mouth or pharynx while the glottis remains closed, and then released. Ejective
plosives are quite common in languages (as in many languages of Africa
and the Americas, e.g. Amharic, Quechua), and ejective fricatives may also
be found. These sounds are transcribed with a small raised glottal stop, or
an apostrophe, following the segment involved, e.g. [p’], [s’]. Ejectives are also
referred to as ‘glottalic’ sounds, and occasionally as ‘glottalized’ sounds.
elaborated (adj.)
A term used by the sociologist Basil Bernstein (1924–2000) to
refer to one of two varieties (or codes) of language use, introduced as part
of a general theory of the nature of social systems and social rules, the other
being restricted. Elaborated code was said to be used in relatively formal,
educated situations; not to be reliant for its meaningfulness on extralinguistic
context (such as gestures or shared beliefs); and to permit speakers to be indi-
vidually creative in their expression, and to use a range of linguistic alternatives.
It was said to be characterized linguistically by a relatively high proportion of
such features as subordinate clauses, adjectives, the pronoun I and passives.
Restricted code, by contrast, was said to lack these features. The correlation of
elaborated code with certain types of social-class background, and its role in
educational settings (e.g. whether children used to a restricted code will succeed
in schools where elaborated code is the norm – and what should be done in such
cases), brought this theory considerable publicity and controversy, and the dis-
tinction has since been reinterpreted in various ways.
E-language (n.)
An abbreviation for externalized language, a term suggested by
Noam Chomsky to refer to a collection of sentences understood independently
of the properties of the mind, and in this sense contrasted with I-language. It
subsumes the notion of a language as a system of utterances or forms paired
with meanings, which it is the purpose of a grammar to describe.
elative (adj./n.) (elat, ELAT)
A term used in grammatical description to
refer to a type of inﬂection which expresses the meaning of motion ‘away
from (inside)’ a place. The elative case (‘the elative’) is found in Finnish, for
example, along with allative, adessive, and several other cases expressing
‘local’ temporal and spatial meanings. ‘Elative’ is often contrasted with ablative
– from inside v. from outside.

egressive

electroglottograph (n.) (EGG)
An instrument used in articulatory phonetics
for registering the vibratory movements of the vocal folds; also called a
glottograph. (Electro)glottography measures changes in electrical resistance across
the neck, using a pair of electrodes placed on the skin on either side of the neck
just above the thyroid cartilage. (Electro)glottographic data is printed out on an
(electro)glottogram. The same process is also referred to as (electro)laryngography,
the difference between the terms reﬂecting different interpretations of the
relative roles of the glottis and larynx being measured by the instrument.
(Electro)laryngographic data is printed out on an (electro)laryngogram. In all
cases, the shorter versions are the standard usage.
electrokymograph (n.)
An instrument used in articulatory phonetics to
enable a record to be made of the changes in oral and nasal airﬂow during
speech. Electrokymography involves the use of a face-mask which can differen-
tiate the two kinds of ﬂow, and associated equipment which can measure air
volume and velocity, and record it visually (as an electrokymogram). It is a
development of the earlier kymograph.
electrolaryngogram, electrolaryngograph(y) (n.)
see electroglottograph
electromyograph (n.) (EMG)
An instrument used in phonetics to observe and
record muscular contractions during speech. Electromyography involves the
application of electrodes (surface pads or needles) to the muscles involved in
the vocal tract, and the analysis of the electromyographic traces produced
visually (electromyogram).
electropalatograph (n.) (EPG)
An instrument used in articulatory phonetics
to enable a continuous record to be made of the contacts between tongue and
palate during speech. Electropalatography involves the use of an artiﬁcal palate
containing several electrodes, which register the tongue contacts as they are
made: the results are presented visually as electropalatograms.
element (n.)
A term used in linguistics, sometimes in the general sense of
‘part’, but often restricted, especially in grammatical analysis, to refer to the
immediate constituents of a unit in a hierarchy. For example, subject/
verb, etc., are functional elements of clause structure: afﬁxes are formal
‘elements’ of word structure.
elicitation (n.)
A term used in linguistics and phonetics to refer to the method
of obtaining reliable linguistic data from speakers (informants) – either actual
utterances, or judgements about utterances (e.g. their acceptability). Several
ingenious elicitation techniques have been suggested to obtain (elicit) this
information in an indirect and unselfconscious way, e.g. asking informants to
perform linguistic tasks which, though apparently irrelevant to the purpose at
hand, will bring to light features of direct interest to the analyst.
elide (v.)
see ellipsis
elide
165

elision (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to the omission
of sounds in connected speech. Both consonants and vowels may be affected,
and sometimes whole syllables may be elided. Unstressed grammatical
words, such as and and of, are particularly prone to be elided, as when the f is
dropped in cup of tea (cf. cuppa tea), or the a and d are dropped in boys ’n’
girls. Within polysyllabic words, the vowels and consonants in unstressed
syllables regularly elide in conversational speech of normal speed, e.g. camera
(/ckamrv/), probably (/cpr∞bl}/), February (/cfebr}/). Complex consonant clusters
are also often reduced, e.g. twelfths becoming /twelθs/ or /twelfs/. Several intric-
ate patterns of inﬂuence can be demonstrated.
Traditional rhetoric was much concerned with the phenomenon of elision,
because of the implications for constructing well-formed metrical lines, which
would scan well. In rhetorical terminology, an elision in word-initial position
was known as aphaeresis or prosiopesis, in word-medial position as syncope,
and in word-ﬁnal position as apocope. A similar classiﬁcation was made for
the opposite of elision, intrusion. See also haplology.
elite bilingualism

ellipsis (n.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to a sentence
where, for reasons of economy, emphasis or style, a part of the structure has
been omitted, which is recoverable from a scrutiny of the context. Tradi-
tional grammars talk here of an element being ‘understood’, but linguistic
analyses tend to constrain the notion more, emphasizing the need for the elided
(or ellipted) parts of the sentence to be unambiguously speciﬁable. For example,
in the sequence A: Where are you going? B: To town, the ‘full’ form of B’s
sentence is predictable from A’s sentence (‘I am going to town’). But in such
sentences as Thanks, Yes, etc., it is generally unclear what the full form of such
sentences might be (e.g. ‘Thanks are due to you’? ‘I give you thanks’?), and in
such circumstances the term ‘ellipsis’ would probably not be used. Elliptical
constructions are an essential feature of everyday conversation, but the rules
governing their occurrence have received relatively little study. They are also
sometimes referred to as reduced, contracted, deleted, or ‘abbreviated’
constructions.
elliptical (adj.)
see ellipsis
elsewhere condition
A principle used in lexical phonology which states
that, when two principles of operation are in conﬂict at a certain point in a
derivation, the one whose domain of operation is more restricted has priority
of action. For example, if all obstruents are voiceless in a language, and all
affricates are voiced, the latter statement will have priority over the former,
in the case of a particular alveo-palatal affricate. The second statement, being
more speciﬁc, has priority over the more general statement, which thus applies
only in contexts where the speciﬁc statements do not obtain – in other words,
‘elsewhere’.
embedding (n.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to the process
or construction where one sentence is included (embedded) in another, i.e.
166
elision

in syntactic subordination. Embedding is distinct from conjoining (co-
ordinating). A relative clause within a noun phrase is an example of
embedding, e.g. The man who has a suitcase is in the bar. In a process view, this
sentence could be derived from The man has a suitcase, which is embedded
within the matrix sentence The man is in the bar. Embedded clauses can also
be complements, as in the discussion of his new book. A derivative notion is
self-embedding (or ‘centre-embedding’).
emergentism (n.)
An approach in psycholinguistics which posits an interac-
tion between biological (nativist) and environmental (empiricist) processes
in language acquisition, and provides an alternative to earlier theories which
focused exclusively on one set of factors (e.g. innateness, cognition, input).
Acquisition is seen to be the result of both innate constraints and environmental
input, which dynamically interact to yield language. For example, the child’s
early guesses about word meaning are viewed as the result of an interaction
between parental input, the child’s cognitive awareness, and the way informa-
tion is stored and retrieved in the child’s brain. There is particular interest in the
ways higher-order structures emerge from lower-order interactions (‘upward
causation’) and the ways higher-order interactions can affect lower levels (‘down-
ward causation’). See also social interactionism.
emic/etic (adj.)
A pair of terms which characterize opposed approaches to the
study of linguistic data. An ‘etic’ approach is one where the physical patterns
of language are described with a minimum of reference to their function
within the language system. An ‘emic’ approach, by contrast, takes full account
of functional relationships, setting up a closed system of abstract contrast-
ive units as the basis of a description. Emic is in fact derived from such
terms as phoneme and morpheme, where -eme refers to the minimal distinct-
ive units involved. An emic approach to intonation, for example, would
describe only those features of the pitch pattern which are used by a language
to signal meanings; an etic approach, on the other hand, would describe the
utterance’s pitch movements much more minutely, regardless of whether the
features described were being used by the language to signal meanings or not.
The distinction is a central feature of the American linguist Kenneth Pike’s
(1912–2000) theory of language, known as tagmemics.
emotive (adj.)
A term sometimes used in semantics as part of a classiﬁca-
tion of types of meaning. The emotive meaning of an expression refers to its
emotional effect on the listener, as in the ‘emotive content’ of propaganda
speeches, advertising language, etc. Alternative terms include affective and
connotative; opposed terms include cognitive and referential.
emphatic consonant
In phonology, a type of consonant, associated par-
ticularly with the Semitic languages (and much studied in Arabic), which is
articulated in the pharyngeal or uvular regions of the vocal tract, or which
has a coarticulation in those regions (such as pharyngealization and
velarization). Emphasis often spreads to a string of adjacent segments, and
the phenomenon is thus widely analysed as a prosodic or ‘long’ component
of word structure.
emphatic consonant
167

empiricism (n.)
An application in linguistics of the general sense of this term
in philosophy to refer to a view of language, and especially of language acquisi-
tion, in which sense experience is seen as the ultimate source of learning. It is
opposed to rationalism, which asserts that knowledge about language can derive
from sources other than sense experience. In empiricism, language acquisition
is seen as a process of generalization from experience; in rationalism, it results
from maturation of a language faculty (‘organ’) governed by various innate
principles. See also behaviourism, emergentism, mentalism.
empty (adj.) (1)
A term used in some grammatical descriptions to refer to a
meaningless element introduced into a structure to ensure its grammaticality.
There is an empty use of it, for example, in such sentences as it’s raining, and
existential there is sometimes regarded in this way (e.g. there are mice in the
larder). Such elements have also been called prop words, or dummy elements.
In generative grammar, empty elements (empty nodes) are displayed in phrase-
markers as deltas ﬁlled by dummies or empty categories. Empty categories
include pro, PRO, and trace (in government-binding theory) and the slash
categories of generalized phrase-structure grammar.
(2)
The term is also sometimes used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of
words to refer to one of two postulated major word-classes in language, the
other being full. Empty words are said to be words which have no lexical
meaning, and whose function is solely to express grammatical relationships,
e.g. to, the, in, of. The distinction has been criticized, on the grounds that there
are degrees of meaning in most grammatical words, few (if any) being really
devoid of content. The term is still used, however – though not as widely as
some other terms (such as grammatical word, function word).
(3)
A term used in morphology, in the phrase empty morph, to refer to a
formal feature in a word which cannot be allocated to any morpheme. A
well-discussed example in English is the word children, where a possible analysis
is into root child and plural sufﬁx -en (cf. oxen); the residual /r/ left by this
analysis is then seen as an empty morph without which the word would not be
exhaustively analysed at the morphemic level.
empty category principle (EPG)
A principle of the government (sub-)theory
of government-binding theory. It requires a trace to be properly governed,
i.e. to be governed either by a lexical category or by a category with the
same index (its antecedent).
enclisis, enclitic (n.)
see clitic
encode (v.)
see code
endangered language
A term used in linguistics for a language which is at
risk of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future. As a result of increased
survey information during the 1980s and 1990s, it is now thought that over half
of the world’s languages are moribund – not being effectively passed on to
the next generation. Language endangerment is followed by language death
unless the trend can be reversed through a language revitalization pro-
gramme. A current preoccupation is the recording of these languages before
they disappear (language documentation).
168
empiricism

endearment, terms of
In sociolinguistics, forms of address used between
people who mutually perceive their relationship to be one of intimacy. Examples
in English include love, dear, honey, mate. Such forms can also be used asym-
metrically, when only one participant uses them (as in service encounters, when
a customer uses one but a shop assistant does not, or vice versa).
endocentric (adj.)
A term used in grammatical analysis as part of a two-way
classiﬁcation of syntactic constructions using distributional criteria: it refers
to a group of syntactically related words where one of the words is function-
ally equivalent to the group as a whole (i.e. there is a deﬁnable ‘centre’ or
head inside the group, which has the same distribution as the whole); it is
opposed to exocentric. Constructions which display endocentricity include
noun phrases and verb phrases (as traditionally deﬁned), where the constitu-
ent items are subordinate to the head, e.g. the big house, the cake with icing,
will be going, and also (in certain analyses) some types of co-ordination, e.g.
boys and girls.
endoglossic (adj.)
In sociolinguistics, a term referring to a language which
is the native language of most (or all) of the population in a geographical area;
it contrasts with exoglossic. English, for example, is endoglossic for most of
Australia and England, but exoglossic for Quebec and Singapore.
endophora (n.)
see endophoric
endophoric (adj.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the relationships
of cohesion which help to deﬁne the structure of a text; it is contrasted with
exophoric relationships, which do not play a part in cohesion, and where the
interpretation requires reference to the extralinguistic situation. Endophoric
relations (endophora) are divided into anaphoric and cataphoric types.
-en form
A term used in English grammatical description to refer to the past
participle form of the verb, e.g. I have taken. It does not necessarily have
this ending, which should be seen solely as a mnemonic device, useful mainly
in writing rules succinctly. The -ed ending is also common in this function (e.g.
I have walked), and may be seen as an alternative symbol.
engineering (n.)
see language planning
enlightened self-interest
A type of economy constraint proposed in the mini-
malist programme as an alternative to greed. While greed allows a phrase
to move to check its own morphosyntactic features, enlightened self-interest
allows a phrase to do this before spell-out (overriding procrastinate) for the
beneﬁt of another item.
entail (v.)
see entailment
entailment (n.)
A term derived from formal logic and now often used as part of
the study of semantics; also called entailingness. It refers to a relation between
a pair of propositions such that the truth of the second proposition necessarily
entailment
169

follows from (is entailed by) the truth of the ﬁrst, e.g. I can see a dog –  I can see
an animal. One cannot both assert the ﬁrst and deny the second. In contem-
porary semantic discussion, entailment has come to be contrasted with presup-
position, in particular because of their different behaviour under negation.
Negating the entailing sentence causes the entailment relation to fail: thus She
cannot see a dog does not entail She can see an animal: the latter may be true or
false. However, both She has stopped buying books and She has not stopped
buying books presuppose She has bought books. Directional entailingness is a
feature of determiners, which may be described as either downward-entailing
(in which the direction is from less speciﬁc to more speciﬁc) or upward-entailing
(in which the direction is from more speciﬁc to less speciﬁc). For example, every
is downward-entailing with respect to the noun phrase of which it is a part:
from Every dog has four legs we may validly infer Every poodle has four legs
(poodle is a hyponym of dog). By contrast, every is upward-entailing with
respect to its verb phrase: Every child likes a banana entails Every child likes
a piece of fruit. The terms are especially used in the study of negative polarity
items. See also logical consequence, monotone.
entrench (v.)
see cognitive grammar
entry (n.) (1)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to the accumu-
lated structural information concerning a lexical item as formally located in
a lexicon or dictionary. A dictionary is seen as a set of lexical entries. The term
is also current in psycholinguistics as part of the mental lexicon.
(2)
In systemic grammar, the phrase entry condition refers to the criterion
which must be met in order for a particular grammatical system to become
operative. For example, in order to operate the system which contains the
choices declarative ~ interrogative ~ imperative, the entry condition
requires that the input be a main clause. The whole of language is viewed as
a network of systems of this kind.
environment (n.) (1)
A general term used in linguistics and phonetics
to refer to speciﬁc parts of an utterance (or text) near or adjacent to a unit
which is the focus of attention. Features of the linguistic environment may
inﬂuence the selection of a particular unit, at a given place in an utterance, and
thus restrict its occurrence, or distribution. For example, in phonology,
whether a consonant phoneme is lip-rounded or not may depend on the
presence of a rounded vowel in its phonetic environment. Sounds are referred
to as being ‘conditioned’ by their environment. In grammar, the term is used
similarly; e.g. the occurrence of one morpheme may depend on the prior use
of another in its environment, as with cran-, which occurs only in the gram-
matical environment of -berry. The term context has also come to be widely
used in this sense. The symbol / (in such contexts as A ⇒ B/C ‘rewrite A
as B in the context of C’) is called an environment bar. See also derived
environment.
(2)
Particularly in the phrase linguistic environment, the term refers to the
sociolinguistic situation in relation to which a particular observation is being
made. In language acquisition, for example, a particular structure might be
said to appear at age two, ‘regardless of the linguistic environment of the child’,
170
entrench

i.e. disregarding the kind of language the child is used to hearing in its social
situation. The term context is sometimes used in this sense also.
epenthesis (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to a type
of intrusion, where an extra sound has been inserted in a word; often
subclassiﬁed into prothesis and anaptyxis. Epenthetic sounds are common
both in historical change and in connected speech (e.g. incredible as
/iºkvred}bl/).
epenthetic (adj.)
see epenthesis
epicene (adj.)
A term from traditional grammar, and now with some use in
sociolinguistics, referring to a noun which can relate to either sex without
changing its form. The term is from Greek epikoinos ‘common to many’, and
was used in Latin and Greek grammar for nouns which stayed in the same
gender regardless of the sex of the being referred to (e.g. Latin vulpes ‘fox/
vixen’). English examples include teacher and doctor. The notion is perceived to
be relevant to contemporary discussion of language and gender.
epiglottis (n.)
An anatomical structure which closes over the larynx during
swallowing. It is not used as an active articulator in speech, though it can
produce an audible trill. See articulation.
epistemic (adj.)
A term derived from modal logic and used by some linguists as
part of a theoretical framework for the analysis of modal verbs and related
structures in language. ‘Epistemic logic’ is concerned with the logical structure
of statements which assert or imply that propositions are known or believed, e.g.
the use of modals in sentences such as The car must be ready, i.e. ‘It is surely
the case that the car is ready’. It contrasts with alethic and deontic modality,
which would interpret this sentence respectively as ‘It is metaphysically neces-
sary for the car to be ready’ and ‘It is obligatory to ensure that the car be ready’.
epithet (n.)
In grammar and stylistics, a word or phrase which character-
izes a noun and is regularly associated with it. Examples include the haunted
house, the iron lady (when Mrs Thatcher was British prime minister), and
William the Conqueror. The term can also be found in pejorative contexts (as in
They hurled foul epithets at each other for several seconds).
eponym (n.)
In onomastics, the name of a person after whom something
(such as an invention or a place) is named; also called an appellative. Eponym-
ous words include cardigan, biro and sandwich. Place names in some countries
are also often eponymous (Washington, Sydney, Gorky).
equational (adj.)
see equative
equative (adj.) (1)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to a type of
sentence where a verb places two noun phrases into a relationship of identity,
e.g. Jo is the leader. The verb which links these elements may be called an
equative or equational verb (or a verb with ‘equative function’) – usually in
English a form of the copula verb be. Some languages (e.g. Russian) have
equative
171

equative sentences where the copula is not present – cf. the stereotyped language
of ﬁlm primitives (him Tarzan, etc.).
(2)
Some grammatical descriptions recognize an equative degree, in analysing
comparison between adjectives or adverbs, e.g. as big as.
equi NP deletion
A rule in classical transformational grammar, usually
abbreviated to Equi, which deletes a subject noun phrase from a comple-
ment clause in a sentence when it is co-referential with another noun
phrase in the main clause of the same sentence. An example is John wants to see
the ﬁlm, where the underlying subject of see is John. In later approaches, this
transformation was eliminated, and these constructions, along with raising
constructions, were referred to as control sentences. In government-binding
theory, the missing subject is analysed as pro.
equipollent (adj.) (1)
A type of opposition recognized in Prague School
phonology, distinguished from privative and gradual. An equipollent oppo-
sition is one where the members are seen as logically equivalent to each other,
contrasted neither gradually nor by a binary feature: e.g. the distinction
between /p/ and /k/ cannot be analysed, according to Nikolai Trubetskoy, as a
difference along a single phonetic continuum, nor can /p/ be seen as ‘non-
velar’, or /k/ as ‘non-bilabial’.
(2)
In some phonological models, equipollent characterizes a feature where
both values are needed (see binary); opposed to privative.
equivalence (n.)
A relationship of equality of power between grammars. Gram-
mars which generate the same set of sentences are said to be equivalent or
weakly equivalent. Grammars which generate the same set of phrase-markers
are strongly equivalent, i.e. they generate not only the same sentences but assign
the same structural descriptions to each. Grammars which display differ-
ences in the labelling or bracketing of structures, or which generate different
sets of sentences, are said to be non-equivalent. The term is also used in other
syntactic and semantic contexts, e.g. ‘distributional equivalence’ (between
units with the same distribution), ‘semantic equivalence’ (i.e. synonymy).
erasure (n.)
see stray
ergative (n.) (erg, ERG)
A term used in the grammatical description of some
languages, such as Inuktitut and Basque, where a term is needed to handle
constructions where there is a formal parallel between the object of a trans-
itive verb and the subject of an intransitive one (i.e. they display the same
case). The subject of the transitive verb is referred to as ‘ergative’ whereas the
subject of the intransitive verb, along with the object of the transitive verb, are
referred to as absolutive. In some languages this kind of case marking (ergativity)
is displayed only under certain circumstances, with accusative patterns being
used elsewhere (split ergativity). For example, in Yucatec Mayan, in the per-
fect, the absolutive marks both the subject of an intransitive verb and the
object of a transitive verb, while the ergative marks the subject of transitives. In
the imperfect, the absolute marks only transitive objects, while the ergative
marks the subjects of both transitives and intransitives. The concept of ergativity
172
equi NP deletion

has also been applied to English and other languages by some linguists, though
the formal markers of the relationships involved are less clear. In this approach,
sentences such as The window broke and The tree broke the window would be
analysed ‘ergatively’: the subject of the intransitive use of broke is the same as
the object of its transitive use, and the agent of the action is thus said to appear
as the ‘ergative subject’. Ergative verbs are also known as unaccusative verbs,
especially in relational grammar.
error (n.) (1)
An application in linguistics of the general use of this term,
referring to mistakes in spontaneous speaking or writing. Several types of
psycholinguistic error have been recognized. ‘Speaker’s errors’, involving difﬁ-
culties with the timing or sequence of commands, will lead to the addition,
deletion or substitution of sounds and morphemes – and are most noticeable in
the phenomenon labelled ‘slips of the tongue’ (relabelled by some psycholinguists
‘slips of the brain’), and in the false starts, pauses, and other non-ﬂuencies of
everyday speech. ‘Hearer’s errors’ are particularly noticeable in language acqui-
sition, as when a child misanalyses an adult sentence (e.g. A: He’s got his hat
on. C: Where’s his hat on?), and in the history of language, where new forms
have come from a reanalysis (or ‘metanalysis’) of older ones (e.g. a napron ⇒ an
apron). The distinction between ‘errors’ of production and perception is
sometimes hard to draw, however – especially as often the only evidence for the
latter is the former – and, generally, the term ‘error’ should be used with caution,
especially in language acquisition studies, where it can be easily confused with
the pedagogical notion of ‘error’ (in the context of essay-marking, etc.).
(2)
In language teaching and learning, error analysis is a technique for identifying,
classifying and systematically interpreting the unacceptable forms produced by
someone learning a foreign language, using any of the principles and procedures
provided by linguistics. Errors are assumed to reﬂect, in a systematic way, the
level of competence achieved by a learner; they are contrasted with ‘mistakes’,
which are performance limitations that a learner would be able to correct. A
distinction is often drawn between errors which are noticed and corrected by the
speaker, errors which the speaker can correct if prompted to do so, and errors
which the speaker cannot correct because of a lack of linguistic knowledge.
esophageal (adj.)
An alternative spelling, especially in American English, for
oesophageal.
essential conditions
see felicity conditions
essive (adj./n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a type of
inﬂection which expresses a state of being. The essive case (‘the essive’) is
found in Finnish, for example, along with adessive, inessive, and several other
cases expressing ‘local’ temporal and spatial meanings.
Estuary English
A variety of British English supposedly originating in the coun-
ties adjacent to the estuary of the River Thames, and thus displaying the inﬂu-
ence of London regional speech, especially in pronunciation; also called simply
Estuary. The name is somewhat misleading (though that has not stopped it
being widely used in the media), in that the deﬁning linguistic features (such as
Estuary English
173

the increased use of glottal stops and the vocalization of ﬁnal /-l/) extend
well beyond the river throughout much of south-east England, among lower-
middle-class speakers, and have been around much longer than the arrival of a
new name suggests. It is to be distinguished from working-class Cockney, lack-
ing some of the salient characteristics of that accent, such as the fronting of
th to /f/. During the late decades of the twentieth century, observers began to
notice the presence of Estuary-like features of accent beyond the south-east,
interacting with other regional varieties. The parallel spread of non-Estuary
features (such as fronted th) indicates that broader issues of language change are
involved. The diffusion has been attributed to a variety of factors, such as the
greater use of the variety in the media and the increased social contact with it
brought about through commuter mobility. The accent achieved considerable
public attention during the 1990s, when it was reported that several commercial
organizations were ﬁnding it a more attractive (‘customer-friendly’) accent than
received pronunciation (RP). However, although gaining in prestige, it cur-
rently remains a regionally marked accent, and is unlikely to replace RP as the
high-prestige variety in regions and cities which already have a strong local
linguistic identity. RP, meanwhile, is undergoing its own process of change.
état de langue /eta dv lFg/
A French term introduced into linguistics by
Ferdinand de Saussure (see Saussurean), referring to a ‘state of language’ seen
as if at a particular point in time, regardless of its antecedents or subsequent
history. An état de langue is therefore the primary subject-matter of synchronic
linguistic study.
ethic(al) dative

ethnography of communication/speaking
see ethnolinguistics
ethnolinguistics (n.)
A branch of linguistics which studies language in rela-
tion to the investigation of ethnic types and behaviour. The term overlaps
to some degree with anthropological linguistics and sociolinguistics,
reﬂecting the overlapping interests of the correlative disciplines involved –
ethnology, anthropology and sociology. The phrase ethnography of communica-
tion or ethnography of speaking has been applied by sociolinguists to the study
of language in relation to the entire range of extralinguistic variables which
identify the social basis of communication, the emphasis being on the descrip-
tion of linguistic interaction. The student of such matters is known as an
‘ethnolinguist’. Ethnosemantics (or ethnographic semantics) takes further the
anthropological perspective in relation to cognitive science, studying the way
meaning is structured in different cultural settings (e.g. in relation to the expres-
sion of kinship, colour, or the discourse structure of speech events) and the
principles governing culturally conditioned semantic variation.

ethnomethodology (n.)
A term referring to a movement that developed in
American sociology of the early 1970s, which led to the development of con-
versation analysis in linguistics. The approach proposed to replace the
predominantly deductive and quantitative techniques of previous sociological
174
état de langue

research, with its emphasis on general questions of social structure, by the study
of the techniques (= ‘methods’) which are used by people themselves (curiously
referred to as ‘ethnic’) when they are actually engaged in social (and thus
linguistic) interaction. The emphasis is on how individuals experience, make sense
of and report their interactions; and ethnomethodological data therefore consist
of tape-recordings of natural conversation, and their associated transcriptions.
ethnopoetics (n.)
The study of oral art forms (including poetry) practised by
indigenous peoples. It focuses especially on the expressive vocal effects and
cohesive structural features of artistic oral discourse, and on methods of
transcription and written presentation. Particular attention is paid to the
identiﬁcation of ‘lines’, metrical patterns, and other recurring linguistic or sty-
listic features, in relation to a typology of oral literature. See also poetics.
ethnosemantics (n.)
see ethnolinguistics
etic (adj.)
see emic/etic
etymology (n.)
The term traditionally used for the study of the origins and
history of the form and meaning of words. In so far as etymology derives its
methods from linguistics (especially semantics), it may be seen as a branch of
historical linguistics. The linguistic form from which a later form derives is
known as its etymon. A folk etymology occurs when a word or phrase is
assumed to come from a particular etymon, because of some association of form
or meaning, and is altered to suit that assumption, e.g. spit and image becomes
spitting image. The etymological fallacy is the view that an earlier (or the oldest)
meaning of a word is the correct one (e.g. that history ‘really’ means ‘investiga-
tion’, because this was the meaning the etymon had in classical Greek). This
view is commonly held, but it contrasts with the attitude of the linguist, who
emphasizes the need to describe the meanings of modern words as they are now,
and not as they once may have been in some earlier state of the language (the
‘oldest’ state, of course, being unknown).
etymon (n.)
see etymology
E-type pronoun
A term used in semantics for a pronoun which is interpreted
as equivalent to a deﬁnite noun phrase construction by modifying the head
of the antecedent of the pronoun with a relative clause constructed from
the minimal clause contained in the antecedent. For example, in Few players like
the manager, and they are all newcomers, the pronoun they is seen as equivalent
to the players who like the manager. The term was introduced by philosopher
Gareth Evans (1946–80); its etymology is unclear, though suggestions range
from the serious (an abbrevation of the originator’s name) to the jocular (an
allusion to the ‘(h)ee-haw’ sound made by donkey sentences, to which the
notion historically relates).
eurhythmy (n.)
A principle proposed in metrical phonology for the inter-
pretation of metrical grids, indicating which grids are possible and preferable.
In particular, it ensures that strings result in a preferred grid conﬁguration
eurhythmy
175

(periodicity), such as the tendency in English towards a particular spacing
of stressed syllables (compare the more general notion of isochrony). The
values of a rhythmic structure can be computed from the grid by a set of
eurhythmic rules; for example, these rules might require the equal spacing of
grid marks at all levels, promoting a regular alternation. The status of the
principle as an evaluative process is controversial.
evaluative (adj.)
A term used in semantics for a type of modality where
propositions express the speaker’s attitude (e.g. surprise, regret) towards what
is being said. For example, Menomini has a pair of sufﬁxes which express the
evaluative notions ‘despite our expectations, X will happen’ and ‘despite our
expectations, X will not happen’.
evaluator (n.) (EVAL)
In optimality theory, a component which compares
the well-formedness of candidates proposed for a given input by the gen-
erator component. The evaluator uses the language’s hierarchy of constraint
to select the optimal candidate (or candidates) for that input. In the gradient
evaluation of a constraint, all violations are counted individually; in binary
evaluation, a constraint is either violated or not.
eventive (adj./n.)
A term used by some linguists as part of the grammatical or
semantic analysis of a sentence in terms of cases or participant roles. An event-
ive utterance (‘an eventive’) usually refers to an element which expresses an action,
accompanying a verb which is relatively ‘empty’ of meaning, e.g. The invasion
happened in 1944 (eventive subject), They are having a row (eventive object).

evidence (n.)
In language acquisition, the data needed to enable a child to
acquire knowledge of a language. Two types of evidence are commonly identi-
ﬁed, following Chomskyan principles: positive evidence refers to the actually
occurring utterances available to the child in its environment; negative
evidence refers to the various indications about what is not acceptable, such as
parental corrections and explanations (‘direct negative evidence’), and the avoid-
ance of certain sentence patterns (‘indirect negative evidence’). The claim that
these types of evidence are so limited (the poverty of the stimulus argument)
underpins the view that some knowledge of language must be innate. See
innateness.
evidentiality (n.)
A term used in semantics for a type of epistemic modality
where propositions are asserted that are open to challenge by the hearer, and
thus require justiﬁcation. Evidential constructions express a speaker’s strength
of commitment to a proposition in terms of the available evidence (rather than
in terms of possibility or necessity). They add such nuances of meaning to a
given sentence as ‘I saw it happen’, ‘I heard that it happened’, ‘I have seen
176
evaluative

evidence that it happened (though I wasn’t there)’, or ‘I have obtained informa-
tion that it happened from someone else’. Tuyuca (Brazil) has a complex system
of ﬁve evidentials; English, by contrast, has none, relying instead on judgements
(propositions which are asserted with doubt, and for which challenge and evidence
is irrelevant).
exceptional case marking (ECM)
A term used in government-binding theory
in connection with certain verbs and the constructions in which those verbs
appear. In general, it applies to the class of subject-to-object raising verbs of
classical transformational grammar, such as believe and consider, which
take some kind of clausal complement (e.g. Mary believes Bill to be a fool,
Mary considers Bill a fool). The exceptional nature of these verbs is in their
ability to assign (objective) case to noun phrase subjects of complement
inﬁnitival clauses or small clauses.
exclamation (n.)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of sentence functions, and
deﬁned sometimes on grammatical and sometimes on semantic or sociolin-
guistic grounds. Traditionally, an exclamation refers to any emotional utter-
ance, usually lacking the grammatical structure of a full sentence, and marked
by strong intonation, e.g. Gosh! Good grief! In Quirk grammar, exclamat-
ory sentences have a more restricted deﬁnition, referring to constructions which
begin with what or how without a following inversion of subject and verb,
e.g. What a fool he was!, How nice! These sentences are sometimes called
exclamatives. Semantically, the function is primarily the expression of the speaker’s
feelings – a function which may also be expressed using other grammatical
means, e.g. What on earth is she doing? (when it is obvious what is being done).
The term is usually contrasted with three other major sentence functions: state-
ment, question and command.
exclamation mark (!)
In optimality theory, a symbol used to mark the
constraint violation at which a candidate is discovered to be non-optimal in
an optimality tableau.
exclamative (adj./n.)
see exclamation
exclusive (adj.) (1) (excl)
With reference to pronouns, a term used (in contrast
with inclusive) to refer to a ﬁrst-person role where the addressee is not included
along with the speaker, e.g. exclusive we = ‘me and others but not you’.
(2)
In semantics, a term derived from formal logic (in contrast with inclu-
sive) to refer to a type of disjunction: in an exclusive interpretation, the
disjunction is true only if one or other of the propositions is true. In Either X
is happening or Y is happening, it is not the case that both X and Y could be
happening at the same time.
exemplar (n.)
A term deriving from cognitive psychology and used in
psycholinguistics as part of a theory of language acquisition and storage.
Exemplar theories assume that people represent categories by storing individual
instances (exemplars) of the category in memory; the classiﬁcation of a new
exemplar proceeds by assessing its similarity to existing previous ones. In
exemplar
177

phonetics, the approach hypothesizes that lexical representations consist of
phonetically detailed memories; the data from which a learner abstracts a
phonological system is viewed as a population of variant forms, some of
which are used more often than others and are thus more inﬂuential. In syntax,
the approach hypothesizes that grammatical constructions arise, not through the
application of a set of rules, but from a series of analogical generalizations
built up from the stored memories of previously encountered instances.
exhaustiveness (n.)
A principle of linguistic analysis whereby the aim is to
specify totally the linguistic contrasts in a set of data, and ultimately in the
language as a whole. It is often cited as one of three scientiﬁc principles to be
adhered to in linguistics, the others being logical self-consistency and economy.
exhaustivity (n.)
In metrical phonology, a foot-shape parameter which
requires that every syllable in a word must be included in metrical structure.
existential (adj./n.)
A term used in the grammatical description of clause
or sentence types, referring to a type of structure commencing with the
unstressed word there followed by a form of the verb be, the notion of existence
thereby being expressed, e.g. there’s plenty to do, there are three cats on the
wall. The relationship between such sentences and others (cf. three cats are on
the wall, the wall has three cats on it, etc.) has attracted particular interest in
linguistics, especially in generative grammar. Several types of existential
sentences have been recognized (including some where other forms than there
and be are involved, e.g. she has a meal ready and there exist several such
ﬁgures), and the relationship between these and other semantic categories (such
as location and possession) is considered to be an important aspect of the
investigation of universal grammatical functions. See also quantiﬁer.
exocentric (adj.)
A term used in grammatical analysis as part of a two-way
classiﬁcation of syntactic constructions using distributional criteria: it refers
to a group of syntactically related words where none of the words is func-
tionally equivalent to the group as a whole (i.e. there is no deﬁnable ‘centre’
or head inside the group); it is opposed to endocentric. The English basic
sentence structure of subject + predicate displays exocentricity, by this deﬁni-
tion (a ‘predicative exocentric construction’), as neither part can substitute
for the sentence structure as a whole, e.g. the man fell cannot be replaced by
either the man or by fell alone. Other types include ‘directive constructions’,
such as preposition + noun phrase sequences (e.g. on the table), where the
adverbial function of the whole is not equivalent to any of its parts; verb +
object sequences (e.g. kick the ball); and ‘connective constructions’, where a
connector element is followed by an attributive element (e.g. seemed angry).

exoglossic (adj.)

exophora (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the process or result
of a linguistic unit referring directly (i.e. deictically) to the extralinguistic
178

situation accompanying an utterance, e.g. there, that, her. Exophoric reference
is usually contrasted with endophoric reference, subclassiﬁed into anaphoric
and cataphoric reference.
expanded pidgin
see pidgin
expansion (n.)
A grammatical process in which new elements are added to
a construction without its basic structure being affected, e.g. the addition
of adjectives before a noun, or auxiliaries before a verb. In generative
grammar, rewrite rules are sometimes called ‘expansion rules’, by virtue of
the fact that a single symbol is expanded into a string of symbols which
represent its constituent structure (e.g. VP ⇒ V+NP). The term is also found
in broader senses, referring to any process whereby an initial linguistic state
is enlarged, e.g. in historical semantics a word’s earlier meaning may come to
be ‘expanded’ to cover a wider range of referents (e.g. Modern English mouse,
as used now in computing); in sociolinguistics, a language or variety may
come to be used in new situations, thus ‘expanding’ its inﬂuence (e.g. through
loan words).
experiencer (n.)
A term used in grammar and semantics to refer to the case
of an entity or person psychologically affected by the action or state expressed
by the verb, as in The dentist heard a noise, The book interested her. The term
is used as part of the discussion of thematic roles within several theoretical
perspectives. In later versions of case grammar, it replaced the term dative.
See also psych, semantic role.
experimental phonetics
see phonetics
explanatory (adj.)
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to a level
of achievement in the writing of grammars. Explanatory adequacy is achieved
when a principled basis is established for deciding the relative merits of altern-
ative grammars, all of which are descriptively adequate (i.e. they account for
the native-speaker’s competence). Several criteria have been suggested for
formalizing this notion, of which relative simplicity is the most investigated.
See also adequacy.
expletive (n.)
An alternative label for dummy elements in government-binding
theory. Expletives, which do not get a thematic role, include weather it,
anticipatory it, and there in existential constructions.
explicature (n.)
see implicature
explicitness (n.)
A characteristic of formulations in linguistics – and especially
a primary goal of generative analysis – whereby all the properties of a rule
and the conditions under which it operates are speciﬁed fully and precisely. In
this sense, explicit descriptions contrast with several found in traditional
grammar, which were often ambiguous, or needed prior knowledge on the part
of the native-speaker to be interpreted (as in the deﬁnition of nouns as names
of persons, places and things, where it is up to the language user to decide
whether a particular item qualiﬁes).
explicitness
179

exponence (n.)
A concept in a hierarchical linguistic analysis, referring
to the relationship of correspondence between linguistic units at a higher level
of analysis and units at a lower level. For example, words can be said to have
phonological units (such as phonemes) as their exponents, and the exponents
of the latter are phonetic features. The term representation is equivalent.
In this sense, abstract units are expounded by other abstract units or by
physical units.
An alternative emphasis restricts the application of the term to the physical
expression of any abstract unit (i.e. at any level), e.g. a morph being the
exponent of a morpheme, a phone of a phoneme, a particular formative
(such as -s) of a syntactic category (such as ‘plural’), the item going of the
lexeme go. There are plainly many possible types of exponence relationships
(e.g. to handle the ‘fusion’ or ‘overlapping’ of exponents). This sense of the
term receives a speciﬁc technical status in Hallidayan linguistic theory (see
systemic grammar), referring to one of the scales of analysis which interrelates
the categories of the theory, viz. the relationship postulated between these
categories and the raw data. For example, the lexical item table is an instance
of (an ‘exponent’ of) the class of nouns. Other scales in this approach are
labelled rank and delicacy.
expression (n.) (1)
This term is used in a general sense in linguistics, refer-
ring to a string of elements treated as a unit for the purposes of analysis and
discussion: expressions have a grammatical and a lexical character, and
are deﬁnable in terms of both, e.g. the expression so be it can be analysed
as a sequence both of form-classes and of lexical items. Expressions can then
be investigated in terms of their semantic properties, as is carried on in
philosophical and logical discussion (through such notions as ‘referring’ and
‘predicative expression’), and as is increasingly the case in linguistics. See also
indexical (2).
(2)
The term is also found in the Saussurean distinction between expres-
sion (or form) and content (or meaning): ‘expression’ here refers to all
aspects of linguistic form, i.e. sounds and their grammatical sequences. A
more restricted sense equates ‘expression’ solely with the level of linguistic
organization of substance, i.e. phonology and graphology. The abstract
formal units which are realized either in phonic or in graphic substance are
sometimes referred to as expression elements, e.g. the expression element /s/ is
realized phonetically as [s] and graphetically as s, ss, etc. In functional
grammar, expression rules play an important role in the ﬁnal stage of sentence
generation.
expressive (adj.)
A term sometimes used in semantics as part of a classiﬁcation
of types of meaning. The expressive meaning of an expression refers both to
its emotional content and to any identity it might have in terms of the person-
ality or individual creativity of the user (as in much poetic language). It is
usually contrasted with descriptive and ‘social’ meaning. Other terms which
overlap with ‘expressive’ include affective, connotative and emotive.
The term is also used in the theory of speech acts to refer to a type of utter-
ance where the speaker expresses his or her feelings, e.g. I apologize/sympathize/
regret.

exponence

extended standard theory (EST)
The name given to a model of generative
grammar which developed in the early 1970s out of that expounded in Noam
Chomsky’s Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965) (the standard theory).
The ‘extension’ is primarily due to the range of the semantic rules, some of
which Chomsky suggested should now be allowed to operate with surface
structure as input. Features of surface structure relevant to the semantics
include various functions of stress and intonation, aspects of quantiﬁca-
tion, and the focus in a sentence which provides information concerning the
sentence’s presuppositions. In other words, it was no longer the case that only
the deep structure was the determinant of the semantic representation of
a sentence. In a later development of this view, it is argued that perhaps the
notion of deep structure can be dispensed with altogether, in relation to the
semantics, this being determined by a developed notion of surface structure. (See
further Chomskyan, revised extended standard theory.)
extension (n.) (1)
A term in philosophy and logic, and now often used as part
of a theoretical framework for linguistic semantics, to refer to the entity or
class of entities to which a word is correctly applied. For example, the exten-
sion (or extensional meaning) of the term ﬂower would be the set of all ﬂowers.
‘Extension’ is the referent or denotation of a word, as opposed to its inten-
sion, which includes only the deﬁning properties of terms. For ‘extensional
contexts’ see opaque (3).
(2)
In historical linguistics, extension is used in the classiﬁcation of types
of semantic change, referring to a widening of meaning in a lexical item;
opposed to narrowing. For example, in Latin ‘virtue’ was a male quality
(cf. vir ‘man’), but today it applies to both sexes.
extensive (adj.)
A term used in some grammatical analyses to refer to structures
where there is no close semantic relationship between elements of structure,
such as subject and object (e.g. he stroked the dog) or direct and indirect
object (e.g. he gave me a letter). Extensive verbs are either transitive or
intransitive, and are contrasted with intensive verbs, such as be.

extraction (n.)
A term used in grammar for a syntactic process which moves
a constituent from within a unit to a position outside that unit. For example,
extraction
181

it is possible to take the subject John in the sentence John saw the elephant
and extract it to function as head of the complement in the associated cleft
sentence: It was John who saw an elephant.
extralinguistic (adj.)
In its most general sense, this term refers to anything in
the world (other than language) in relation to which language is used – the
extralinguistic situation. The term extralinguistic features is used both generally,
to refer to any properties of such situations, and also speciﬁcally, to refer to
properties of communication which are not clearly analysable in linguistic
terms, e.g. gestures, tones of voice. Some linguists refer to the former class of
features as metalinguistic; others refer to the latter class as paralinguistic.
extrametricality (n.)
A principle in metrical phonology which allows cer-
tain elements in a given string not to count when assigning metrical structure,
i.e. the rules of stress assignment ignore such elements; also called extra-
prosodicity. Proposals for English include consonant extrametricality (applying
to the ﬁnal consonant in a word), noun extrametricality (applying to the ﬁnal
segment in certain types of noun, such as museum and elephant), and adjective
extrametricality (applying to certain adjective sufﬁxes). Extrametricality,
which is restricted to peripheral elements, enables the analysis to avoid rare
or unknown foot types at word edges, to handle the stresslessness of
peripheral syllables, and to mark exceptions to the stress rules.
extraposition (n.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to the process
or result of moving (or extraposing) an element from its normal position to a
position at or near the end of the sentence, e.g. That the boy came in late upset
the teacher, compared with It upset the teacher that the boy came in late. The it
which is introduced in such sentences is known as extrapositive it. The term is
also used for the transformation which is responsible for the alternation
between The girl in a blue dress arrived and The girl arrived in a blue dress; in
such a case, we have extraposition out of a subject phrase.
extrapositive it

extraprosodicity (n.)

extrasyllabic (adj.)
A term used in autosegmental phonology with two
different but related applications.
(a)
It may refer to segmental material appearing in word-ﬁnal position
which cannot be syllabiﬁed according to the principles that appear to hold
word-internally; extrasyllabic material has also been called a termination or an
appendix. Further statements are required which may add or remove restrictions
on what can appear word-ﬁnally. Because this situation reﬂects the stable status
of word-ﬁnal segments, it is sometimes called licensed extrasyllabicity, as
opposed to the contingent notion described next.
(b)
The term is also used to handle a situation where consonants fail to
become syllabiﬁed during the syllabiﬁcation procedure, and remain unattached
to any syllable until a later point in a derivation. This unstable situation is
182
extralinguistic

often called contingent extrasyllabicity, to distinguish it from the more general
notion referred to under (a).
extrinsic (adj.)
A term used in generative grammar referring to a type of
constraint imposed on the ordering of rules (as opposed to a condition where
such rules are allowed to apply in a random order). An extrinsic ordering is
one where the sequence of rules is motivated solely by a consideration of the
facts of a language and not by considerations of a logical kind: it is a speciﬁc
ordering which is required to ensure that only grammatical sentences are
generated. Extrinsic rules are held by many to be of particular importance in
organizing the transformational rules in grammar, but the nature of these
constraints is controversial, such as how much extrinsic ordering there ought
to be, and how many times the rules in an ordered sequence should apply. It is
opposed to intrinsic.

F
face (n.)
In pragmatics and interactional sociolinguistics, a term used in the
analysis of politeness phenomena. Positive face is the desire to show involve-
ment with others; negative face is the desire not to offend others. These factors
can be used to analyse the kind of rapport which exists in an interaction: for
example, a speaker may choose to phrase something differently in order not
to offend. Face helps to account for different types of interactive style – for
example, associated with the expression of distance, deference, or friendliness –
whose proposed universality is a topic of current research.
factitive (adj./n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a con-
struction or form (usually a verb) denoting an action in which a cause
produces a result: e.g. make, kill, choose, elect could be called ‘factitive verbs’
(or ‘factitives’). In early case grammar, the term has special status, where it
refers to the semantic case of the entity resulting from the verb’s action, or
understood as part of the verb’s meaning, and is contrasted with agentive,
dative, etc. (compare the later use of result, in this theory).
factive (adj./n.)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of verbs, referring to a verb
which takes a complement clause, and where the speaker presupposes the
truth of the proposition expressed in that clause. For example, know, agree,
realize, etc. are ‘factive verbs’ (or ‘factives’): in she knows that the cat is in the
garden, the speaker presupposes that the cat is in the garden. ‘Factive predicators’
may involve other classes than verbs: adjective and noun constructions,
for example, may display factivity, as in it’s surprising that he left, it’s a shame
that he left. By contrast, non-factive constructions do not commit the speaker to
the truth of the proposition expressed in the complement clause, e.g. believe,
think, as in she thinks that the cat is in the garden. Contrafactive constructions
presuppose the falsity of the proposition expressed in the complement clause,
e.g. wish, pretend, as in I pretended the cat was in the garden.
factorial typology
In optimality theory, the hypothetical typology produced
by all possible permutations of constraint rankings. For any set of freely
rankable constraints, the theory predicts the possibility of languages exhibiting
each possible ranking.

FAITH
An abbreviatory convention in optimality theory for a type of faith-
fulness constraint. Examples (with their associated features) include FaithC,
Faith [High], Faith [Place], and Faith [Voice].
faithfulness (n.) (FAITH)
In optimality theory, the degree to which one
form (typically the output) preserves the properties of another form (typically
the input). Faithfulness constraints penalize differences between the input and
output representations. A set of abbreviatory conventions indicate the type of
constraint, such as FaithC (faithfulness of consonants between output and
input) and FaithV (faithfulness of vowels).
fall (n./v.)
see falling
falling (adj.) (1)
A term used in classifying the linguistic uses of pitch, referring
to a movement from relatively high to relatively low. Falling tones (or falls) of
various kinds (e.g. ‘high/low falling’, ‘falling-rising’) may be encountered in the
study of intonation systems and of tone languages.
(2)
A term used in a two-way classiﬁcation of diphthongs (opposed to ris-
ing), referring to cases where the ﬁrst element of the diphthong receives the
maximum prominence (usually sonority). An example is the diphthong in the
English word lie [la}], where the [a] element is more prominent (sonorous) than
the [}].

false cognates
see false friends
false friends
In comparative linguistics, a term describing words in different
languages which resemble each other in form, but which express different
meanings; also called false cognates, and often known by the French equivalent
expression faux amis /fopzacmip/. Examples include French demander, which
translates into English as ‘to request’ not ‘to demand’, and Italian caldo which
translates as ‘warm’ not ‘cold’.
family (n.)
A term used in historical linguistic studies to characterize a
genetic model of the relationships between languages. A ‘family’ of languages
is the set of languages deriving from a common ancestor, or ‘parent’, e.g. the
Indo-European (IE) family consists of the ‘daughter’ languages Sanskrit, Greek,
Latin, etc., which all developed out of Proto-Indo-European (PIE). Groupings
within a family may be referred to as sub-families (e.g. the Romance sub-family
within the Italic family). The family tree is a representation of these relationships
devised by comparative philologists in the nineteenth century. As compar-
ative studies grew to include larger numbers of potentially related languages, the
term ‘family’ came to be used with increasing generality, often applied to cases
where a genetic relationship was impossible to demonstrate. Usage varies greatly,
but there is now a trend to avoid this term for language groups with only a
family
185

remote degree of relationship, or where a clear ancestor language is unknown.
Phylum (plural phyla) has come to be widely used in such cases – with macro-
phylum available for still less deﬁnite groupings. For example, many scholars
therefore now talk of the ‘Australian phylum’ (of Aboriginal languages), though
in popular usage ‘family’ will still be heard. Proposed clusters of languages
within phyla are variously called ‘groups’, ‘sub-groups’, or ‘branches’, with no
ﬁxed usage. ‘Stock’ is also found as an alternative to ‘family’.
fatherese (n.)
see motherese
faux amis
see false friends
favourite (adj.)
A term used by some linguists in the classiﬁcation of sen-
tence types to refer to the most productive sentence pattern in a language.
In English, the subject + predicate (NP+VP) pattern is the favourite (or
major) type, other types being referred to as non-favourite (or minor).
feature (n.)
A term used in linguistics and phonetics to refer to any typical
or noticeable property of spoken or written language. Features are classiﬁed in
terms of the various levels of linguistic analysis, e.g. ‘phonetic/phonological/
grammatical/syntactic features’ or in terms of dimensions of description,
e.g. ‘acoustic/articulatory/auditory features’. At the most general level,
features may be classiﬁed as linguistic (or ‘intralinguistic’) as opposed to ‘non-
linguistic’ (extralinguistic or metalinguistic). At the most speciﬁc level, certain
types of feature may be set up as the minimal units of a theory, as in distinctive
feature theories of phonology. The term is sometimes abbreviated as F, as in
some models of non-linear phonology.
In generative grammatical analysis, the term has come to be associated with
the way in which words are classiﬁed in the lexicon in terms of their grammat-
ical properties, such as [animate], [common], [masculine], [countable]. Such
features are usually considered to be binary, as were phonological features,
and analysed as [+animate], [−animate], etc. semantic features, likewise, can be
handled in binary terms, as in the analysis of spinster as [+human], [+adult],
[+never married] and [+female] (or perhaps, [−male]). Non-binary (‘unary’ and
‘multi-valued’) features are also recognized. Features are sometimes referred to
as components, especially in semantic analysis. In later grammatical theories,
especially in phrase-structure grammars, grammatical categories are deﬁned
in terms of feature speciﬁcations – ordered pairs containing a feature and a
feature value – which rules can access. As part of its method, this approach
requires a statement of feature-co-occurrence restrictions (FCRs) and feature-
speciﬁcation defaults. Later semantic theory has also developed the notion of
feature in several directions, notably in the use of feature structures which
represent types of lexical information organized hierarchically. Features (e.g.
‘cause’, ‘change’, ‘force’ as part of the representation of push) are here seen as
modal operators that label arcs between the nodes in a lattice framework.
In the minimalist programme, features ﬁgure prominently, a distinction being
drawn between semantic, phonological, and morphosyntactic features, the latter
being further divided into ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ features, or ‘interpretable’ and
‘uninterpretable’ features. The approach also recognizes a distinction between
186
fatherese

formal and substantive (i.e. containing semantic content) features. See also con-
text, diacritic, distinctive feature, syntax.
feature geometry
In non-linear phonology, a model of the ways in which
features are organized in phonological representations. Approaches to feature
geometry look especially at the non-linear relationship between features, and at
the way they can be grouped into a hierarchical array of functional classes.
Feature values are arrayed on separate tiers (levels, planes, layers . . . ), where
they may enter into non-linear relations with each other. At the same time,
features are organized into hierarchical arrays, in which each constituent
functions as a single unit in phonological rules. Several models of feature theory
have been proposed, such as articulator-based feature theory, constric-
tion theory, and underspeciﬁcation.
feature percolation
see percolation
feedback (n.)
An extension of the technical use of this term in communication
theory, referring to the process whereby the sender of a message obtains a
reaction from the receiver which enables a check to be made on the efﬁciency of
the communication. More speciﬁcally, some linguists have suggested it as a
deﬁning property of human language (contrasting with the properties of other
semiotic systems), whereby speakers are able to monitor their own perform-
ance (both by self-observation, and by observing the response-signals of others).
The term complete feedback is usually used for this property, when it is seen as
a ‘design feature’ of language. In phonetics, speakers’ awareness of their own
production of sound is also referred to as feedback; this may be auditory (via
the ear), kinaesthetic (via the internal sensation of articulatory movement) or
vibratory (via bone conduction). Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) takes place
when a delay is artiﬁcially introduced into the transmission of speech between
mouth and ear, so that the signal reaches the ear somewhat later than is norm-
ally the case. Certain periods of delay cause marked alteration in one’s ability
to speak with normal ﬂuency; conversely, the speech of stammerers can some-
times be improved by using this technique.
feeding (n.)
A term used in generative linguistic analysis of rule-ordering
and originally introduced in the context of diachronic phonology, to refer
to a type of functional relationship between rules; opposed to bleeding.
A feeding relationship is one where the application of one rule (A) creates a
structural representation to which another rule (B) is applicable, and thus
increases (feeds) the number of forms which can be generated. If rule B is X ⇒
Y, then rule A must be of the form W ⇒ X. In these circumstances, rule A is
called a feeding rule in relation to B, and the linear order of these rules is
called a feeding order. If the rules are applied in the reverse order, A is said to
counter-feed B. Counter-feeding results in a non-affecting interaction in which
a rule fails to realize its potential to increase the number of forms to which
another rule applies.

felicity conditions
A term used in the theory of speech acts to refer to the
criteria which must be satisﬁed if the speech act is to achieve its purpose. Several
kinds of felicity conditions have been suggested. ‘Preparatory conditions’ relate
to whether the person performing a speech act has the authority to do so (e.g.
not everyone is qualiﬁed to ﬁne, christen, arrest, etc.). ‘Sincerity conditions’
relate to whether the speech act is performed sincerely (e.g. the speaker is not
lying). ‘Essential conditions’ relate to the way the speaker is committed to a
certain kind of belief or behaviour, having performed a speech act (e.g. accepting
an object that one has just requested). For example, felicity conditions which
have been suggested for the analysis of indirect requests include the speaker’s
believing that the hearer has the ability to carry out the request, and the exist-
ence of good reasons for making the request in the ﬁrst place. An utterance
which does not satisfy these conditions cannot function as a valid instance of
the type of speech act to which they apply, e.g. will you drive? is inappropriate
as a request if the speaker knows that the hearer has not learned to drive, and
the mutual awareness of this inappropriateness would lead to an interpretation
of a different order (e.g. as a joke, as sarcasm, etc.). Such utterances are said to
be infelicitous.
feminine (adj.)
see gender
ﬁeld (n.) (1)
A term used in semantics to refer to the vocabulary of a lan-
guage viewed as a system of interrelated lexical networks, and not as an
inventory of independent items. The theory of semantic ﬁelds (ﬁeld theory)
was developed in Europe in the 1930s (especially by Jost Trier (1894–1970),
and later Johann Leo Weisgerber (1899–1985)). Conceptual ﬁelds (e.g. colour,
kinship) are isolated, and the lexical items used to refer to the various features
of these ﬁelds are analysed in terms of a network of sense relations. This
network constitutes the lexical structure of the semantic (or ‘lexical’) ﬁeld.
Several interpretations of this notion can be found in the semantics literature of
the period.
(2)
In Hallidayan linguistics, ﬁeld of discourse (or simply, ﬁeld) refers to a
classiﬁcation of registers in terms of subject-matter, e.g. the ‘ﬁelds’ of chemistry,
religion, advertising.
(3)
The usual sense of the term ﬁeldwork (or ﬁeld study) is also used in
linguistics referring to the principles and procedures of obtaining linguistic
data from informants, especially in their home environment.
(4)
In tagmemics, ﬁeld refers to the analysis of linguistic units in terms of
their distribution – as distinct from their status as particles (physically
discrete items) or waves (their variant forms).
ﬁle change semantics
A theory within model-theoretic semantics in which
sentences are analysed as instructions for revising speaker ‘ﬁles’ of information.
It has devoted special attention to the study of deﬁniteness, indeﬁniteness
and anaphora, and provided an early example of a dynamic semantic theory.
It is similar in many respects to discourse representation theory.
ﬁlled pause
A term used by some linguists to refer to a non-silent pause, i.e.
a hesitation which has been ‘ﬁlled’ by er, erm, or some such vocalization.
188
felicity conditions

ﬁller (n.)
A term used in some models of linguistic analysis, especially
tagmemics, to refer to a form which can be used at a given place, or slot, in
a structure.
ﬁlter (n./v.) (1)
A process ﬁrst recognized in the standard theory of gener-
ative grammar (see aspects model), whereby in a derivation only certain
base phrase-markers are transformed into surface structures, others being
‘ﬁltered out’ by the application of various constraints (speciﬁed, for example,
by the non-lexical transformations). It assumes a more central role in
government-binding theory, where it refers to a type of condition which
prevents the generation of ungrammatical sentences. Filters state simply that
any structure of type X is ill formed. They are also known as ‘output con-
straints’ or ‘surface-structure constraints’. For example, a ‘FOR–FOR ﬁlter’ has
been proposed, which states that any surface structure containing the sequence
for–for is ungrammatical; this thereby excludes the generation of sentences in
which verbs like hope for are used along with their for+inﬁnitive comple-
ments (cf. What she is hoping for is for John to win), as in the ungrammatical
*She is hoping for for John to win.
It is important to distinguish ‘ﬁlters’ from ‘constraints’: the former apply
solely to the structure which is the output of a given set of rules; the latter
apply to two successive stages within a derivation. Filters are claimed to be
more general, more universal and more constraining on theory construc-
tion than the constraints which restrict the application of speciﬁc rules: a ﬁlter
blocks the generation of a sentence (S), regardless of the set of rules which have
applied in generating that sentence, whereas a constraint blocks the application
of a speciﬁc set of rules to produce S (thus allowing the possibility that S might
none the less be generated by the application of other sets of rules). See also
case (2).

See source (2).
ﬁltered speech
In phonetics, speech which has been passed through ﬁlters
(devices which only allow signals of certain frequencies to pass) to alter its
acoustic characteristics. The distorted speech produced is often used in research
into speech perception – for example, determining the extent to which words
can still be recognized after certain frequencies have been removed.
ﬁnal (adj.)
The usual way of referring to the last element in a linguistic unit,
especially in phonology; sometimes abbreviated as F in such contexts as FV (=
‘ﬁnal vowel’). For example, the phoneme /t/ occurs ‘in ﬁnal position’ (or ‘ﬁnally’)
in the word cat; the morpheme of plurality occurs in ﬁnal position in English
words. Other positions are referred to as initial and medial.
ﬁnal state
In language acquisition, a term describing a stage of achievement
equivalent to an adult’s knowledge of a language. A contrast is sometimes
drawn with language in its initial state, in both ﬁrst- and second-language
acquisition.
ﬁnite (adj.)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of types of verbs
and clauses. A ﬁnite verb (phrase) is a form that can occur on its own in an
ﬁnite
189

independent sentence (or main clause); it permits formal contrasts in tense
and mood. Non-ﬁnite forms of the verb, on the other hand, occur on their own
only in dependent clauses, and lack tense and mood contrasts. All forms except
the inﬁnitives and participles (-ing and -en forms) are ﬁnite, e.g. is walking,
have walked, walks. Clauses which contain a ﬁnite verb are ﬁnite clauses (these
in English always contain a subject, except in the case of commands); other-
wise, they are non-ﬁnite clauses (e.g. walking down the street, to kick the ball).
ﬁnite automata
see automaton
ﬁnite-state grammar (FSG)
A type of grammar discussed by Noam Chomsky in
his book Syntactic Structures (1957) as an illustration of a simple generative
device. Finite-state grammars generate by working through a sentence ‘from
left to right’; an initial element is selected, and thereafter the possibilities of
occurrence of all other elements are wholly determined by the nature of the
elements preceding them. For example, in the sentence The cat saw the dog, the
grammar would start by specifying the ﬁrst word (i.e. selecting one of the set
of possible ﬁrst words for a sentence in English), proceed from this ‘initial state’
to specify the next word (i.e. one of the set of words which can follow the),
and continue this process until the ‘ﬁnal state’ of the sentence has been arrived
at. Chomsky shows how this extremely simple kind of grammar is incapable
of accounting for many important processes of sentence formation, as in dis-
continuous constructions, e.g. The boys who saw John are going, where the
grammatical relationship of boys to are cannot be handled in a ﬁnite-state
grammar. Alternative grammars are discussed by Chomsky which improve on
this model in several respects (see phrase-structure and transformational
grammars). Finite-state grammars, also called ‘one-sided linear grammars’, ‘regular
grammars’ and ‘Type-3 grammars’ (see Chomsky hierarchy), generate ﬁnite-
state languages (FSLs).

Firthian (adj.)
Characteristic of, or a follower of, the linguistic principles
of J(ames) R(upert) Firth (1890–1960), Professor of General Linguistics in the
University of London (1944–56), and the formative inﬂuence on the develop-
ment of linguistics in Great Britain (the ‘London School’ of linguistics). A central
notion is polysystemicism, an approach to linguistic analysis based on the
view that language patterns cannot be accounted for in terms of a single
system of analytic principles and categories (monosystemic linguistics), but that
different systems may need to be set up at different places within a given level
of description. Other central Firthian notions include his contextual theory
of meaning, with its strong emphasis on the social context of situation;
prosodic (as opposed to phonemic) phonology, and collocation. Relat-
ively little of Firth’s teaching was published, but many of his ideas have been
190
ﬁnite automata

developed by a neo-Firthian group of scholars, whose main theoretician is
M. A. K. Halliday, Professor of General Linguistics in the University of London
from 1965 to 1970 (see Hallidayan).
ﬁs phenomenon
A commonly used name for a behaviour recognized in language
acquisition, in which children refuse to accept an adult’s imitation of their
own mispronunciation. The name derives from the ﬁrst report of this behaviour
in the early 1960s, since when several other such names have been used (e.g.
the ‘wabbit’ phenomenon). An investigator referred to a child’s toy ﬁsh as his
/f}s/, imitating the child’s form; the child refused to accept the adult’s pronun-
ciation of /f}s/, despite the fact that his own version was identical, yet was
unable to produce the ‘correct’ form. Such phenomena are interpreted as
evidence for a more well-developed perceptual than productive linguistic
ability in the young child, some investigators concluding that it is in fact the
adult phonological form which is stored in the child’s brain, or that the child
may have two disassociated lexical stores – one for production and one for
perception.
ﬁssion (n.)
A term sometimes used in phonology and morphology to refer
to a process in which one linguistic unit is split into two. In some recent models
of phonology, for example, it is one of two formal processes used to represent
the relationship between monophthongs and diphthongs. In particular, in
particle phonology, it refers to the process which splits one root node
into two, thus providing a mechanism for handling diphthongization and other
types of ‘breaking’ phenomena. In distributed morphology, ﬁssion handles
certain cases of double exponence.
ﬁxed (adj.) (1)
A term used in linguistics and phonetics to refer to an
unchanging aspect of the structure of a linguistic unit; opposed to free.
It occurs in such phrases as ‘ﬁxed stress’ (i.e. the stress always falling on
a particular syllable in a word, e.g. the penultimate syllable in Welsh),
and ‘ﬁxed word-order’ (i.e. languages with word-order patterns that cannot
be altered without a change of meaning, e.g. English). See also formulaic
language.
(2)
See latent consonant.
ﬂap (n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their manner of articulation; it refers to any sound produced
by a single rapid contact between two organs of articulation (excluding vocal
fold vibration). The usual occurrence of this is in the production of types of
r sound, as when in English very the r is produced by the tip of the tongue in
a ﬂapped articulation against the alveolar ridge (transcribed [Ü]). The main
phonetic contrast is between this sound and the trill, where several vibrations
are involved. Some phoneticians distinguish systematically between ﬂaps and
taps, on the grounds that in the case of ﬂaps the articulator which makes the
contact is returning to a position of rest, whereas in the case of taps this is not
so, and the contact resembles a very rapid stop articulation. Such a distinction
has been cited for Hausa and Tamil, but it is not common.
ﬂap
191

ﬂat (adj.) (1)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a structure which has
no hierarchical constituency. For example, in grammatical theory, sen-
tences have a ﬂat structure if they lack the NP–VP conﬁguration. non-
conﬁgurational languages with free word-order are analysed as having a
ﬂat structure. In phonology, a ﬂat analysis of the word cat would be c+a+t,
ignoring possible intermediate notions such as onset, rhyme, etc.
(2)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle (see Jakobsonian)
in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to handle lip-rounding,
the opposite being plain. Flat sounds are deﬁned articulatorily and acous-
tically, as those involving a relatively narrow mouth opening with accom-
panying velarization (see velar), and a weakening of the high-frequency
components of the sound spectrum. Lip-rounded sounds all have the feature
[+ﬂat], as would retroﬂex, velarized and pharyngealized (see pharynx)
sounds; unrounded sounds are [–ﬂat], as are all sounds lacking these secondary
articulations.
(3)
See slit.
ﬂexion (n.)
see inﬂection
ﬂoating (adj.) (1)
In generative linguistics, a term referring to an element
which has no ﬁxed association with a place in a derivation. In particular,
ﬂotation is used in some models of non-linear phonology with reference to
a unit which is not associated to some higher level of prosodic structure (i.e.
it is not prosodically licensed). For example, latent consonants (e.g. French
liaison) have no skeletal slot, and are therefore ﬂoating, whereas ﬁxed con-
sonants are anchored. A ﬂoating tone is one which has been separated from
a syllable following the application of a phonological rule, and now has no
association with any particular tone-bearing unit in the representation. The
term ‘docking’ is sometimes used to refer to the process whereby a ﬂoating unit
is reattached to a representation: for example, a ﬂoating tone would ‘dock’
with a syllable if it were assigned to a vowel already carrying a tone or to a
toneless vowel. In autosegmental phonology, the term ﬂoating trace is used
with two applications: to a morpheme whose underlying representation is
composed of segments only on a tonal tier; and to a segment which, at a given
point in a derivation, is not associated with any vowel (as a consequence of
a vowel becoming deleted).
(2)
The term is also used in generative syntax for an element which is able
to move from one position to another in a sentence structure. The best-
known examples are ‘ﬂoating quantiﬁers’ like all and both, as in Both the cars
have been painted/The cars have both been painted.

focal area

focus (n.) (foc)
A term used by some linguists in a two-part analysis of
sentences which distinguishes between the information assumed by speakers,
192
ﬂat

and that which is at the centre (or ‘focus’) of their communicative interest;
‘focus’ in this sense is opposed to presupposition. (The contrast between
given and new information makes an analogous distinction.) For example, in
the sentence It was Mary who came to tea, Mary is the focus (as the intona-
tion contour helps to signal). Taking such factors into account is an important
aspect of inter-sentence relationships: it would not be possible to have the above
sentence as the answer to the question What did Mary do?, but only to Who
came to tea?

foot (n.) (1) (Ft)
A term used by some phoneticians and phonologists to
describe the unit of rhythm in languages displaying isochrony, i.e. where
the stressed syllables fall at approximately regular intervals throughout an
utterance. It is an extension of the term used in traditional studies of metrical
verse structure, where the many regular patterns of stressed/unstressed syllable
sequence were given a detailed classiﬁcation (e.g. ‘iambic’ for an unstressed+
stressed (
≈
/) pattern: ‘trochaic’ for a stressed+unstressed (/
≈
) pattern; ‘spondaic’
for a pattern of two stresses; ‘dactylic’ for /
≈≈
; ‘anapaestic’ for 
≈≈
/). In a more
general phonological sense, the notion is applied to any utterance in a stress-
timed language, not just verse. The rhythm of an utterance, in this approach, is
analysed ﬁrst in terms of intonation units, and these are analysed into feet, e.g.
/the cman is cwalking in the gàrden/ is a single tone unit consisting of three
feet. The term has particular relevance in several models of non-linear phono-
logy, such as metrical phonology, where it refers to an underlying unit
of metrical structure (or stress-foot), consisting of syllable rhymes, and organ-
ized into constituents that make up phonological words. Feet are classiﬁed
as ‘left-headed’ (the leftmost rhyme is stressed) or ‘right-headed’ (the rightmost
rhyme is stressed). Feet no longer than two syllables in length are bounded
feet; a foot containing only one syllable is called a degenerate foot; the dele-
tion of a foot from a representation is sometimes called defooting. In later
metrical theory, foot dominance is a foot-shape parameter which determines
the side of the foot where the head is located: in left-dominant feet, all left
nodes are dominant and right nodes recessive; in right-dominant feet, the
reverse situation obtains. In prosodic morphology, the foot is a member of
the prosodic hierarchy of mora, syllable, foot and (prosodic) word. Syllables
are said to be footed if they can be assigned a foot structure; unfooted other-
wise. In optimality theory, the term *footless is used to refer to a constraint
which requires that all syllables be footed (the asterisk indicating that the
effect is not acceptable).
(2)
In the phrase foot-feature principle, the term is used in generalized phrase-
structure grammar: it refers to a principle governing the distribution of
features which express information that constituents are missing or have to
be bound to some constituent (see binding).

In optimality theory, an abbreviation for a markedness
constraint requiring each foot to contain either two morae or two syllables;
usually represented as FootBin.
footless (adj.)

foregrounding (n.)
A term used in stylistics (especially poetics) and some-
times in pragmatics and discourse analysis, to refer to relative prominence
in discourse, often involving deviance from a linguistic norm; the analogy is
of a ﬁgure seen against a background (and the rest of the text is often referred
to as backgrounding). The deviant or prominent feature is said to have been
foregrounded. For example, the use of rhyme, alliteration and metrical regularity
are examples of foregrounding operating at the level of phonology.
foreign language

forensic linguistics
In linguistics, the use of linguistic techniques to investig-
ate crimes in which language data forms part of the evidence, such as in the use
of grammatical or lexical criteria to authenticate police statements. The ﬁeld
of forensic phonetics is often distinguished as a separate domain, dealing with
such matters as speaker identiﬁcation, voice line-ups, speaker proﬁling, tape
enhancement, tape authentication, and the decoding of disputed utterances.
form (n.)
One of the most widely used terms in linguistics, with a corres-
pondingly wide range of meanings. Its main areas of application are:
(1)
form v. meaning/function. In its most general sense, it refers to the abstract
phonological and/or grammatical characterization of language, as opposed
to its meaning, as in such phrases as ‘linguistic form’, ‘grammatical form’, ‘one
form–one meaning (OFOM)’. More speciﬁcally, it refers to the phonological/
grammatical/lexical characteristics of linguistic units, such as sentences, mor-
phemes, lexemes, nouns, etc., these being referred to as linguistic forms. The
term here is often contrasted with function: one can study a unit such as the
noun phrase from both formal and functional points of view (e.g. its internal
syntactic structure v. its role as subject, object, etc., in a clause). More speci-
ﬁcally still, it refers to a particular instance of a grammatical category, as in
such phrases as ‘the analysis of the forms be, seem, have . . .’ A set of forms
displaying similar or identical grammatical features is said to constitute a
form-class, e.g. walk, come, see are part of the form-class of verbs because
they have similar morphological characteristics and syntactic distribu-
tion. Phonological/grammatical criteria which identify units and classes are
known as formal criteria. ‘Formal’ here is also contrasted with the ‘notional’
approach of traditional grammar, where attempts were made to characterize
linguistic units in terms of universal notions, as in the deﬁnition of a sentence
as ‘the expression of a complete thought’.
(2)
form v. substance. Here, the term refers to the overall linguistic organiza-
tion, or structure, of speech or writing, as opposed to the physical realiza-
tion of language in phonic or graphic substance. In this sense, semantic
structure is included, along with grammar and phonology/graphology, being
part of the abstract language system.

form v. substance and meaning. Hallidayan linguistic theory models lan-
guage in terms of three interdependent levels: the level of ‘form’ (comprising
the grammatical and lexical organization of language) is distinguished from the
levels of substance and context.
(4)
forms (of a unit). The variant realizations of a linguistic unit are referred to
as ‘forms’ of the unit, i.e. the members of a set of paradigmatic alternatives.
For example, the forms of the verb walk are walk, walking, walks, etc.
(5)
The critical characteristics of a linguistic theory, especially as stated in the
formalized terms of logic or mathematics, are referred to as the form of that
theory. In generative grammar, the formal characteristics of linguistic theory
have received special attention, especially in the notion of ‘formal universals’.
Formal semantics refers to analysis (in terms of truth conditions, etc.) of a
logical system, such as propositional calculus – an approach which has come
to be applied to the study of natural languages (see Montague grammar).

formalism (n.)

formalist (adj./n.)
A term applied in stylistics to any approach which regards
a text as a formal object of study, with an internal structure that can be
objectively and formally identiﬁed. Such approaches have been primarily asso-
ciated with East European structural linguists.
formality (n.)
In stylistic and sociolinguistic studies, a dimension of social
behaviour ranging from the most strictly regulated to the least regulated, and
reﬂected in language by varied linguistic features. Highly formal language
involves carefully organized discourse, often with complex syntax and vocabu-
lary, which closely follows the standard language, and which is often sens-
itive to prescriptive judgements. Highly informal language is very loosely
structured, involving a high level of colloquial expression, and often depart-
ing from standard norms (e.g. by using slang, regionalisms, neologisms, and
code-mixing).
formalization (n.)
A characteristic of formulations in linguistics – and espe-
cially a primary goal of generative analyses – whereby the rules, principles,
conditions, etc. governing an analysis are capable of being speciﬁed in a
precise and rigorous way. Ultimately it ought to be possible, in any formaliza-
tion, for a linguistic analysis to be interpreted in logical or mathematical terms,
and a calculus developed (see form (5)). A ‘formalized’ account of an area of
language, in this sense, is opposed to an ‘informal’ one. A speciﬁc feature, or
set of features, used as part of the process of formalization, is known as a
formalism.

formant (n.) (F)
A term in acoustic phonetics of particular value in the
classiﬁcation of vowels and vowel-like sounds, and of transitional features
between vowels and adjacent sounds. A formant is a concentration of acoustic
energy, reﬂecting the way air from the lungs vibrates in the vocal tract, as it
changes its shape. For any vowel, the air vibrates at many different frequencies
all at once, and the most dominant frequencies combine to produce the distinct-
ive vowel qualities. Each dominant band of frequencies constitutes a formant,
which shows up clearly in a record produced by a sound spectrograph as a
thick black line. Three main formants provide the basis of vowel description: the
ﬁrst formant (F1) is the lowest, and the second and third formants (F2, F3) are
respectively higher. Other formants are less signiﬁcant for linguistic analysis.
The formants can be related to the articulatory descriptions of vowels,
as represented, say, by the cardinal vowel diagram. The ﬁrst formant, for
example, decreases in its frequency as one moves from low to high (e.g. sat ⇒
set ⇒ seat). In the case of consonants, similar correlations can be established:
for example, in the transition from velar consonants, the second and third
formants come very close together. See also antiformants.
formation rule
A term from formal logic used in relation to the generative
semantics model of linguistics to refer to the initial set of rules which
generate the semantic representations of sentences.
formative (n.)
A formally identiﬁable, irreducible grammatical element which
enters into the construction of larger linguistic units, such as words and
sentences. It has come to be used especially in generative grammar, as an
alternative to the term morpheme, for the terminal elements in a surface-
structure representation of a sentence. Several types of formative can be
distinguished, depending on their role in sentence structure, e.g. ‘inﬂectional
formatives’ (viz. inﬂectional endings, etc.), ‘lexical formatives’ (viz. forms
which enable one lexical item to be derived from another, e.g. -tion).
form-class (n.)

form of address

formula, formulae (n.)
see formulaic language
formulaic language
A term used in some theoretical and descriptive studies
of grammar to refer to utterances which lack normal syntactic or mor-
phological characteristics. (It may also be used, literally, to mean ‘language
containing formulae’, or special symbols, as in scientiﬁc writing.) Sentences such
as God save the Queen, The more the merrier, How do you do? and Many happy
returns do not contrast in the usual way with other sentences in the language,
e.g. Few happy returns, How will you do? Such fossilized structures, often
used in limited social situations, have also been called ‘bound’, ‘ﬁxed’, ‘frozen’,
‘set’, ‘prefabricated’, ‘routine’ or ‘stereotyped expressions’. The notion can
be broadened from individual utterances to larger spoken or written events.
Formulaic discourse refers to any ﬁxed form of words which serves a particular
social purpose, such as greeting exchanges, skipping rhymes, or the words of a
196
formant

marriage ceremony; it contrasts with free discourse. The notion is seen as import-
ant also in psycholinguistics, where it is recognized as a phenomenon which
facilitates language processing and language acquisition.
form word
A term sometimes used in word classiﬁcation for a word whose
role is largely or wholly grammatical, e.g. articles, pronouns, conjunctions.
Several such terms exist for this notion (e.g. function word, grammatical
word, structural word, functor); all contrast with the lexical words in a
language, which carry the main semantic content.
fortis (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to a sound made with
a relatively strong degree of muscular effort and breath force, compared with
some other sound (known as lenis). The distinction between tense and lax is
used similarly. The labels ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ are sometimes used for the con-
trast involved, but these are more prone to ambiguity. In English, it is the
voiceless consonants ([p], [t], [f], [s], etc.) which tend to be produced with
fortis articulation (their voiced counterparts being relatively weak), and often,
when the voicing distinction is reduced, it is only the degree of articulatory
strength which maintains a contrast between sounds. The term ‘fortis’ is some-
times used loosely to refer to strong vowel articulation also, but this is not a
standard practice.
fortition (n.)
A term used in phonology to refer to a strengthening in the
overall force of a sound, whether diachronically or synchronically;
opposed to lenition. Typically, fortition involves the change from a fricative to
a stop, an approximant to a fricative, or a voiced to a voiceless sound (as in
the devoicing of ﬁnal obstruents in German).
forward-reference (n.)
see reference (1)
fossilized (adj.) (1)
A term used in grammar and lexicology to refer to
a type of construction which is no longer productive in a language.
In English, for example, fossilized sentences include So be it, Long live the
Queen and Least said, soonest mended; fossilized lexical items include such
reduplicative forms as goody-goody, hocus-pocus, and several types of
idiom.
(2)
In the acquisition of a foreign language, the stabilization of a level of
achievement in the use of a linguistic form which falls short of the norms of the
target language. No further learning takes place, and the form becomes a fossilized
error in the usage of the learner, part of the learner’s interlanguage.
fourth person
see obviative
frame (n.)
A term used in some models of grammatical description to
refer to the structural context within which a class of items can be used.
For example, the frame She saw – box provides an environment for the use
of determiners (the, a, my, etc.). The terms syntactic frame and substitution
frame are also used. In generative grammar, sub-categorization frames are
frame
197

used to specify the range of sister constituents which a lexical item takes.
In case grammar, the array of cases which speciﬁes the structural context for
verbs is known as a case frame. In lexical entries for verbs, in this theory,
abbreviated statements called frame features indicate the set of case frames into
which the various verbs may be inserted. In semantic theory, frames are struc-
tures that encode knowledge about stereotyped kinds of objects or situations,
with special provision for the roles played by their parts or participants.
free (adj.)
A term used in a range of linguistic contexts to refer to a phono-
logical or grammatical feature lacking a speciﬁc type of formal constraint.
For example, a free form or free morpheme is a minimal grammatical unit
which can be used as a word without the need for further morphological
modiﬁcation (opposed to bound); free word-order occurs when the word-
order in a language can be altered without a consequent change of meaning
(opposed to ﬁxed); free stress occurs whenever there is no ﬁxed place for
the primary stress to fall in a polysyllabic word; free discourse is spoken
or written expression which makes no use of formulaic language, unlike
‘formulaic discourse’. In formal syntax and semantics, the term is applied to
constituents which are not bound, such as variables and anaphors. See
also free variation.
free form/morpheme

freely associating segments
see association line
free relative clause

free variation
A term used in phonology, referring to the substitutability
of one sound for another in a given environment, with no consequent change
in the word’s meaning, as when a speaker articulates a word like sit with an
unreleased or a released plosive, or different pronunciations are given to either
(/ip¨v/ v. /a}¨v/). These different phonetic realizations of a phoneme are called
free variants (opposed to the ‘contextual variants’ found in cases of comple-
mentary distribution). In traditional phonological study, free variation has
been considered to be an area of little importance; but in sociolinguistic
studies it is suggested that free variants need to be described, in terms of the
frequency with which they occur, because the choice of one variant rather than
another may be made on sociological grounds, as when one ‘chooses’ a careful
rather than a ‘casual’ speech style.
The term ‘free variation’ is occasionally applied analogously in grammar
and semantics, as when synonymous expressions might be said to be in
‘free variation’.
frequency (n.)
A term derived from the study of the physics of sound, and used
in acoustic phonetics, referring to the number of occurrences of a sound
wave in a unit of time (usually a second); it is measured in hertz (Hz), a term
198
free

which has replaced the older ‘cycles per second’. An increase in the frequency of
a sound correlates with an auditory sensation of higher pitch. See also formant,
fundamental frequency.
frequentative (adj./n.) (freq)
A term sometimes used in the grammatical clas-
siﬁcation of verbs to refer to the expression of repeated action. In some
languages (e.g. Russian) the class of ‘frequentatives’ may be marked mor-
phologically, but in English the meaning is normally expressed through
adverbials of frequency, e.g. again, regularly, often.
frication (n.)
In acoustic phonetics, the turbulent noise produced by the
vocal organs engaged in the production of fricatives and other conson-
ants involving a constricted airﬂow. Although the signal is random, it usually
shows a concentration of energy in a speciﬁc frequency range, related to
the articulator involved, the particular shape of the part of the vocal tract
with which it is articulating, and the general physical environment of the tract
in that area.
fricative (n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their manner of articulation: also sometimes called spirant,
it refers to sounds made when two organs come so close together that the
air moving between them produces audible friction, or frication. There is
no complete closure between the organs (in which case a plosive articula-
tion would be produced): there is simply a stricture, or narrowing. There are
several such sounds in English, both voiced and voiceless, as in ﬁn [f], van [v],
thin [θ], this [¨], sin [s], zoo [z], ship [à], measure [è], hoop [h]. Other fricative
sounds may be heard in English, in restricted contexts or speech styles, such
as the palatal fricative [ç], and several other fricatives may be heard in other
languages, e.g. a voiceless velar fricative [x] in Welsh or German, a voiceless
pharyngeal fricative [∑] in Arabic, a voiced bilabial fricative [β] in Spanish.
The fricative manner of articulation produces a wider range of speech sounds
than any other. They are sounds with a potential for considerable duration
(e.g. s-s-s), and, from this point of view, the opposite of fricative (i.e. a continu-
ant sound lacking friction) is called a frictionless continuant. The term
spirantization is sometimes used for the process of deriving a fricative from
some other type of articulation.
friction (n.)
A term used in phonetics to refer to the sound produced
when air passes a constriction made in the vocal tract. The occurrence of
audible friction is part of the phonetic deﬁnition of consonants; the phonetic
deﬁnition of vowels requires that they be frictionless. Various types of
friction can be identiﬁed, in terms of anatomical point of origin, e.g. bilabial
friction, pharyngeal friction; friction above the glottis may be referred to as
supraglottal friction.
frictionless continuant
A general term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of
speech sounds on the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to any
sound functioning as a consonant but which lacks the closure or friction
which identiﬁes most consonantal articulations. In received pronunciation,
frictionless continuant
199

/r/ is often articulated in this way, with no audible friction. From a phonetic
point of view, all vowels and vowel-like sounds are also technically ‘frictionless’
and ‘continuant’, but it is usual to restrict the term to those sounds which are
consonantal in function. All nasals and laterals are thus classiﬁable under
this heading, as well as many varieties of /r/. In received pronunciation, the
post-alveolar /r/ is often articulated in this way, without audible friction, and
is often described speciﬁcally as a ‘post-alveolar frictionless continuant’. Some
phoneticians use the term approximant to refer to these sounds.
front (adj./v.) (1)
In phonetics, classiﬁcations of front speech sounds are of
two types: (a) those articulated in the front part of the mouth (as opposed to
the back); (b) those articulated by the front part (or blade) of the tongue.
Front sounds which satisfy both criteria would be front vowels, as in see, bit,
pet, cap, and such front consonants as the initial sound of two, do, see, zoo,
this, thin. Consonants such as those in pay and bay are, however, front in sense
(a) only. Front vowels, it should be noted, are in traditional phonetic classiﬁca-
tion contrasted with central and back vowels. In distinctive feature ana-
lyses of sound systems, front in sense (a) is referred to as anterior, in sense
(b) is referred to as coronal.
In some analyses of sound patterns, it is useful to talk about fronting, a
process common in historical sound change, and when children are learning to
speak, whereby a sound (or group of sounds) may come to be articulated further
forward in the mouth than the accepted adult norms. It is also often useful to
analyse one sound as being fronted when compared with a back variant of the
same phoneme: for example the /k/ phoneme in English has both front and back
variants (as in key and car respectively) owing to the inﬂuence of the following
vowel. The analogous terms ‘backing’/‘backed’, are not commonly used.
(2)
Fronting is also a term used in transformational grammar referring
to any transformation which transposes a constituent from the middle or end
of a string to initial position. For example, the rule of ‘Wh-fronting’ places a
WH-phrase (e.g. where, which books) in initial position, transposing it from the
underlying non-initial position (cf. John walked there ⇒ John walked where ⇒
where did John walk).

f-structure (n.)
An abbreviation in lexical-functional grammar for func-
tional structure, a representation of a sentence in terms of grammatical
functions such as subject and object. It contrasts with c-structure (or
constituent structure), the surface structure of the sentence.
full (adj.)
A term sometimes used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of
words to refer to one of two postulated major classes in language, the other
being empty. Full words are said to be those which contain lexical meaning
(e.g. table, man, go, red) as opposed to empty words, which have a purely
200
front

grammatical role. The distinction has come under criticism, largely on the grounds
that the boundary between ‘full’ and ‘empty’ words is not as clear-cut as is sug-
gested. Words like while, but, in, etc., are considered to be grammatical words,
but they plainly do have some independently stateable meaning. ‘Full’ may also
be encountered as part of the speciﬁcation of types of grammatical unit, e.g.
full verb (i.e. the lexical verb in the verb phrase), full sentence (i.e. a major
sentence type, consisting of subject and predicate), full predication (in func-
tional grammar).

function (n./v.)
One of the most widely used terms in linguistics, with a cor-
respondingly wide range of meanings. There are four main areas of application.
(1)
The relationship between a linguistic form and other parts of the linguistic
pattern or system in which it is used. In grammar, for example, the noun
phrase can ‘function’ in clause structure as subject, object, complement,
etc., these roles being deﬁned distributionally. Syntactic functions (or ‘syntactic
relations’ or ‘grammatical relations’) of this kind are a major feature of several
models of linguistic analysis, including the approaches of the Prague School,
glossematics, relational grammar and lexical functional grammar,
and the terms functional analysis and functional linguistics have been used to
characterize theories which treat the notion of function as central (see also
functional sentence perspective, functional grammar). In government-
binding theory and phrase-structure grammars, grammatical functions (GF)
are notions deﬁned in terms of the position in clause structure of a constituent;
in relational and lexical functional grammars they are primitives. Functional
explanations of grammatical phenomena are also to be found in communicat-
ive and discourse-based grammars. More speciﬁcally, the term functional is
used of an element which is distinctive, or contrastive, within a language
system, as in one deﬁnition of phonology as functional phonetics. See also
axiom, category.
(2)
The use made of a linguistic contrast in a system is sometimes referred
to as its functional load or yield. The term is usually used with reference to
phonology, where in English, for example, the contrast between /p/ and /b/
would be said to have a higher functional load than between /à/ and /è/: the
former contrast distinguishes many minimal pairs, whereas the latter contrast
distinguishes only a few. Several criteria are used in making such quantitative
judgements, such as the position within a word at which the contrast is found,
and the frequency of occurrence of the words in the language.
(3)
The role language plays in the context of society or the individual is also
referred to by the term ‘function’ (social function). For example, language is
used (‘functions’) to communicate ideas, to express attitudes, and so on. It may
also be used to identify speciﬁc sociolinguistic situations, such as informality
or intimacy, or varieties of language such as science and law: in such cases,
one might talk, for instance, of the ‘function’ of scientiﬁc language being to
function
201

express a certain mode of experience in a certain way, and so on. Several
detailed classiﬁcations of the social functions of language have been made,
especially in Hallidayan linguistics, and in relation to pragmatics and the
theory of speech acts. The traditional classiﬁcation of sentence functions falls
between grammatical and speech-act theory: sentences are said to ‘function’ as
statements, questions, commands, etc. In narratology, the term is used in
the analysis of plots for a type of action performed by one or more types of
character, such as ‘Villain harms member of family’. See also narrative.
(4)
In formalized analyses, function is often used in its general mathematical
sense: a relation which matches each object in its domain with exactly one
value. See also functor (2).
functional application/composition
Terms used in formal linguistics in their
conventional mathematical senses, and adapted in categorial grammar to
rules which combine (a) an expression of some complex category X/Y with
an expression of some category Y to form an expression of category X (func-
tional or function application), and (b) an expression of some complex category
X/Y with an expression of some category Y/Z to form an expression of category
X/Z (functional or function composition). The terms are also used for similar
rules in type-theoretic approaches to semantics.
functional category
A type of category recognized in government-binding
theory, illustrated by INFL (inﬂection, often abbreviated as I), Comp
(complementizer, C), and Det (determiner, D). IP, CP and DP are the corres-
ponding functional projections. (I and IP are referred to as T (tense) and TP in
more recent literature.) Functional categories are not required to contain overt
phonetic content, but some may be present in the form of morphological
realizations, such as English third-person -s.
functional change
In historical linguistics, the alteration of the role of a
linguistic feature over time – especially, when a sound takes on or loses the
status of a phoneme. For example, in Old English, /s/ was heard as [z] only
between voiced sounds, but in modern English /z/ has become a phoneme in its
own right, as shown by such contrasts as Sue v. zoo.
functional composition
see functional application/composition
functional grammar
A linguistic theory which was devised in the 1970s as an
alternative to the abstract, formalized view of language presented by trans-
formational grammar, and relying instead on a pragmatic view of language
as social interaction. The approach focuses on the rules which govern verbal
interaction, seen as a form of co-operative activity, and on the rules (of syntax,
semantics and phonology) which govern the linguistic expressions that are
used as instruments of this activity. In this approach, a predicate is taken to be
the basic element of a ‘predication’; it is listed in the lexicon in the form of a
‘predicate frame’, speciﬁed for the number of arguments it takes (agent, goal,
etc.). From predicate frames, ‘nuclear predications’ are formed by inserting
appropriate terms into the argument positions. ‘Full predications’ are formed
from nuclear predications through the use of satellites (e.g. manner, locative).
202
functional application/composition

Syntactic functions (interpreted semantically) and pragmatic functions are then
assigned to elements of predication, and expressed in sentences through the
use of ‘expression rules’ (which deal with such matters as case, agreement,
order and intonation).

functional sentence perspective (FSP)
A theory of linguistic analysis associated
with the modern exponents of the Prague School of linguistics. It refers to an
analysis of utterances (or texts) in terms of the information they contain,
the role of each utterance part being evaluated for its semantic contribution
to the whole. The notion of ‘communicative dynamism’ has been developed
as an attempt to rate these different levels of contribution within a structure,
particularly with reference to the concepts of rheme and theme.

function word
A term sometimes used in word classiﬁcation for a word whose
role is largely or wholly grammatical, e.g. articles, pronouns, conjunctions.
Several such terms exist for this notion (e.g. form word, grammatical word,
functor, empty word); all contrast with the lexical words in a language,
which carry the main semantic content.
functor (n.) (1)
A term sometimes used in word classiﬁcation for words and
bound morphemes whose role in language is largely or wholly grammatical,
such as prepositions, articles, pronouns, conjunctions. Several such terms
relate to this notion (e.g. function word, grammatical word, form word,
empty word); all contrast with the lexical words in a language, which carry
the main semantic content.
(2)
In formalized analyses, a functor is an expression which denotes a
function. In categorial grammar, it is the syntactic category of such
an expression, generally represented by a pair of category labels separated by
a slash.
fundamental frequency
A term derived from the study of the physics of
sound, and used in acoustic phonetics, referring to the lowest frequency
fundamental frequency
203

component in a complex sound wave. The fundamental, or F0 (f nought),
sometimes called the ‘ﬁrst harmonic’, is of particular importance in studies of
intonation, where it displays a reasonably close correspondence with the pitch
movements involved.
fusion (n.)
In some models of phonology, a type of rule which accounts for
various processes of feature coalescence; also called merger, and contrasted
with ﬁssion. In particular, in particle phonology, fusion is a process which
merges two root nodes into one, thus providing a mechanism for handling
monophthongization.
fusional (adj.)
A term describing a type of language sometimes distinguished
in comparative linguistics using structural (as opposed to historical) cri-
teria, and focusing on the characteristics of the word: in fusional languages,
words typically contain more than one morpheme, but there is no one-to-one
correspondence between these morphemes and the linear sequence of morphs
the words contain. Languages such as Latin and Sanskrit represent this type,
also known as inﬂecting languages. For example, in Latin amicus (‘friend’),
this form fuses the features masculine, nominative and singular, in addition to
the root, in a manner which makes the word extremely difﬁcult to segment
morphologically (except by word-and-paradigm techniques). As always in
such classiﬁcations, the categories are not clear-cut: different languages will
display the characteristic of fusion to a greater or lesser degree.
The term is also used, independently of this classiﬁcation, to refer to the merging
of exponents within a linguistic unit, especially a word; e.g. took represents the
‘fusion’ of take + past; sounds may be ‘fused’ in some types of assimilation.
future tense (fut, FUT)
In grammar, a tense form which refers to future time,
as in French J’irai ‘I’ll go’. English has no inﬂectional future tense, but has
many ways of referring to future time, such as through the use of the modal
verbs will/shall, future-time adverbials (tomorrow, next week), and such
verbs as be about to. The will/shall forms are usually called ‘future tenses’ in
traditional grammar, but many linguists consider this to be misleading, as
these forms express several other meanings than future time (such as timelessness
in Stones will sink in water). Analogously, the use of will/shall have was called
the future perfect tense (or the ‘future in the past’) in traditional grammar.
fuzzy (adj.)
A term derived from mathematics and used by some linguists
to refer to the indeterminacy involved in the analysis of a linguistic unit
or pattern. For example, several lexical items, it is argued, are best regarded
as representing a semantic category which has an invariant core with a
variable (or ‘fuzzy’) boundary, this allowing for ﬂexibility of application to a
wide range of entities, given the appropriate context. The difﬁculty of deﬁning
the boundaries of cup and glass has been a well-studied example of this indeter-
minacy. Other items which lend fuzziness to language include sort of, rather,
quite, etc. (and see also squish). Fuzzy grammars, advocated in the early 1970s,
were grammars capable of generating sentences with speciﬁc degrees of assigned
grammaticality. The notion is seen as particularly important in non-discrete
grammar.

G
gamma-marking (n.)
A term used in government-binding theory for a
feature [+gamma] which is assigned to empty categories that are properly
governed. Empty cateogries that are not properly governed are assigned
[−gamma].
gap (n.) (1)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the absence of a linguistic
unit at a place in a pattern of relationships where one might have been
expected; also called an accidental gap or hole in the pattern. The term occurs
especially in semantics, where a lexical gap can be illustrated by the absence of
a male v. female distinction within the term cousin (cf. brother/sister, uncle/
aunt, etc.). An example of a phonological gap would be seen in a language
where the phonemic contrasts /p/, /b/ and /t/, /d/ were not matched by a
corresponding velar pair, only /k/ being found. A morphological gap can be
illustrated by a deverbal noun which does not take the usual -al sufﬁx:
*devisal alongside refusal, perusal, proposal, etc.
(2)
The term is also used in syntax: an example of a syntactic gap would
be the underlying direct object position in Who did you invite –? Gaps
are often assumed to contain phonologically empty categories (symbolized as e).
A parasitic gap is postulated when the presence of a syntactic gap depends on
the prior existence of another gap in the structure of the sentence. See also
pattern.
gapping (n.)
A term proposed in generative grammar to refer to the absence
of a repeated verb in clauses which have been conjoined – a ‘gap’ appears in
the reduced clause, e.g. She went to London and he to New York.
garden-path sentences
A term used in psycholinguistics for sentences which,
viewed from left to right one word at a time, mislead the listener/reader into an
interpretation which later information in the sentence shows to be incorrect. We
have been ‘led up the garden path’. A much-cited example is The horse raced
past the barn fell. This sentence has to be reanalysed when fell forces us to take
raced not as a main-clause verb but as an elliptical relative clause (‘that was
raced’). The study of such sentences provides insights into the way the brain

gemination (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology for a sequence of
identical adjacent segments of a sound in a single morpheme, e.g. Italian notte
/nÑtte/ (‘night’). Because of the syllable division, a geminate sequence cannot
be regarded as simply a ‘long’ consonant, and transcriptional differences
usually indicate this, e.g. [-ff-] is geminate, [-fp] is long. The special behaviour
of geminates has been a particular focus in some approaches to non-linear
phonology, as a part of the discussion of the way in which quantitative
phenomena should be represented. Those long segments which cannot be separ-
ated by epenthetic vowels (‘true’ geminates, represented with multiple asso-
ciation) are said to display geminate ‘inseparability’ or ‘integrity’. Those which
fail to undergo rules because only one part of the structure satisﬁes the struc-
tural description are said to display geminate ‘inalterability’. True geminates
are contrasted with ‘fake’ or ‘apparent’ geminates, where identical segments
have been made adjacent through morphological concatenation.
gender (n.)
A grammatical category used for the analysis of word-classes
displaying such contrasts as masculine (m, masc, MASC), feminine (f, F, fem,
FEM) and neuter (n, neut, NEUT), animate and inanimate, etc. Discussion of
this concept in linguistics has generally focused upon the need to distinguish
natural gender, where items refer to the sex of real-world entities, and grammatical
gender, which has nothing to do with sex, but which has an important role in
signalling grammatical relationships between words in a sentence (adjectives
agreeing with nouns, etc.). The gender systems of French, German, Latin, etc.,
are grammatical, as shown by the form of the article (e.g. le v. la) or of the
noun (e.g. nouns ending in -a are feminine). Grammatical gender is not a feature
of English, though some parts of the language can be analysed in such terms
(e.g. the correlation between pronouns, he/she co-occurring with who/whose,
etc., whereas it co-occurs with which). English gender contrasts are on the
whole natural, viz. he refers to male people, animals, etc. The few cases of other
kinds of usage (e.g. a ship being referred to as she) pose interesting problems
which have attracted considerable discussion in linguistics. See also animate.

general (adj.) (1)
A commonly used characterization of linguistics, when one
wants to emphasize the universal applicability of linguistic theory and method
in the study of languages. General linguistics thus includes the theoretical,
descriptive and comparative biases of the subject. It is sometimes seen in
contrast with those branches of linguistics where there is an interdisciplinary or
applied orientation (as in sociolinguistics, applied linguistics). A similar use
of the term is in the phrase general grammar found in several early language
studies (e.g. the Port Royal grammar), and often used in generative linguistic
contexts in the sense of ‘universal grammar’. General phonetics emphasizes the
applicability of phonetic methods of analysis to all human speech sounds. General
semantics, by contrast, has nothing to do with linguistics in its modern sense,
referring to a philosophical movement developed in the 1930s by the American
scholar Alfred Korzybski (1879–1950), which aimed to make people aware of
the conventional relationship between words and things, as a means of improving
systems of communication and clear thinking.

gemination

(2)
A property of those linguistic analyses and descriptive statements which are
applicable to a relatively wide range of data in a language, and which are
expressed in relatively abstract terms. A statement which can be made only with
reference to individual units (e.g. lexical items, sounds, constructions), or
to small classes of units, is said to ‘lack generality’. The aim of the linguist is to
make generalizations about data which need as few qualiﬁcations as possible
(e.g. about exceptions, or restricted contexts of use), and which are meaning-
ful to native-speakers (i.e. they are linguistically signiﬁcant general-
izations). Likewise, linguistic theories should be as general as possible, i.e.
aiming to establish the universal characteristics of human language. Within this
broad approach, the term has been given several speciﬁc applications, e.g. in
generalized phrase-structure grammar, or in the ‘true generalization con-
dition’ of natural generative phonology – a constraint which insists that all
rules should express generalizations about the relationship between all surface-
structure forms in the most direct and transparent manner possible. Phono-
logical rules should relate surface forms to each other, rather than to a set of
abstract, underlying forms, as is required in traditional generative phonology.
(3)
In language acquisition, generalization refers to the process whereby
children extend their initial use of a linguistic feature to a class of items, as
when, having learned to use an -ing ending on a verb, the feature is ‘generally’
applied to the class of verbs. Overgeneralization takes place when the feature is
extended beyond its limits in the adult grammar – as when the regular plural
ending is applied to irregular forms, e.g. *mouses, *sheeps.
General American (GA)
A term used for the majority accent of American
English which conveys little or no information about the speaker’s regional
background. The accent is used, for example, by most radio and television
presenters, and is not without some internal variation, but it is thought of as
chieﬂy excluding speakers with eastern (New England) or southern backgrounds.
It is often referred to as Network English or Network Standard.

generalized phrase-structure grammar (GPSG)
A linguistic theory which
was developed as an alternative to transformational accounts of language.
GPSGs are weakly equivalent to a class of context-free phrase-structure grammars
(PSGs). In GPSG, there are no transformations, and the syntactic structure of a
sentence is a single phrase-marker. Also, in traditional PSG, category labels
(e.g. np, s) have no internal structure, whereas in GPSG a category is a set of
feature speciﬁcations (ordered pairs containing a feature and a feature value)
which rules can access. Instead of phrase-structure rules, GPSGs employ
separate immediate dominance and linear precedence rules. These interact
with various general principles, feature co-occurrence restrictions, and feature
speciﬁcation defaults to determine what local trees (i.e. trees consisting of a
node and its daughter or daughters) are well formed. This approach allows
generalized phrase-structure grammar
207

several generalizations to be captured in a way that is not possible with phrase-
structure rules. GPSGs also employ metarules, which derive immediate domin-
ance rules from immediate dominance rules. An important offshoot of GPSG
is head-driven phrase-structure grammar. A further generalization of this
approach has been called generalized generalized phrase-structure grammar
(G2PSG), in which the head-feature convention, the foot feature principle,
the control agreement principle, and the system of feature speciﬁcation
defaults are subsumed into a single mechanism – an extension of the feature
co-occurrence restriction mechanism of standard GPSG.
generalized quantiﬁer theory
In semantics, a generalization of the logical theory
of quantiﬁers beyond the traditional study of universal and existential
quantiﬁcation, applied in the analysis of noun phrases, determiners and
other expressions. The theory typically treats noun phrases as denoting sets of
individuals, and determiners as denoting relations between sets.
generalized transformation
A type of transformational rule recognized in
early models of generative grammar, where the rule operates with an input
of two or more terminal strings. Two subtypes are recognized: conjoining
transformations handle co-ordination; embedding transformations handle
subordination. The notion was revived in the minimalist programme as a
more general operation called merger.

generative (adj.) (1)
A term derived from mathematics, and introduced by Noam
Chomsky in his book Syntactic Structures (1957) to refer to the capacity of
a grammar to deﬁne (i.e. specify the membership of) the set of grammat-
ical sentences in a language. Technically, a generative grammar is a set of
formal rules which projects a ﬁnite set of sentences upon the potentially inﬁnite
set of sentences that constitute the language as a whole, and it does this in
an explicit manner, assigning to each a set of structural descriptions.
Related terms are generate and generation, referring to the process involved, and
generativist, referring to the practitioner. Several possible models of generative
grammar have been formally investigated, following Chomsky’s initial discus-
sion of three types – ﬁnite-state, phrase-structure and transformational
grammars. The term has also come to be applied to theories of several different
kinds, apart from those developed by Chomsky, such as arc-pair grammar,
lexical functional grammar and generalized phrase-structure grammar.
There are two main branches of generative linguistics: generative phonology and
208
generalized quantiﬁer theory

generative syntax. The term ‘generative semantics’ is also used, but in a different
sense (see (2) below). See also Chomskyan, phonotactics.
(2)
The generative semantics school of thought within generative linguistic
theory was propounded by several American linguists (primarily George Lakoff
(b. 1941), James McCawley (1938–99), Paul Postal (b. 1936) and John Ross
(b. 1938)) in the early 1970s; it views the semantic component of a grammar
as being the generative base from which syntactic structure can be derived.
One proceeds in an analysis by ﬁrst providing a semantic representation of a
sentence, and this single level is all that is needed to specify the conditions
which produce well-formed surface structures. The subsequent syntactic
rules are solely interpretive, and there is no intermediate level. This puts
the approach plainly in contrast with the claims of Noam Chomsky and others
(in the standard theory) who argued the need for a level of syntactic deep
structure as well as a semantic level of analysis. ‘Generative’ in this phrase
has, accordingly, a narrower sense than in ‘generative grammar’ as a whole,
as it is speciﬁcally opposed to those models which operate with a different,
interpretive view of semantics. The proponents of this approach are known as
generative semanticists.
generator (n.) (GEN)
In optimality theory, a component which creates a
(potentially inﬁnite) set of possible linguistic candidates whose faithfulness
properties can be considered in relation to a particular input. The generator
also encodes the correspondences which exist between input and output
representations. See also evaluator.
generic (adj./n.)
A term used in grammatical and semantic analysis for a
lexical stem or proposition which refers to a whole class of entities rather
than to individual members. Examples of ‘generic terms’ (or ‘generics’) include
the bat is an interesting creature, bats are horrid, a bat makes a good pet, the
English/French . . . , the poor/rich/good . . .
genetic classiﬁcation
In historical linguistics, the classiﬁcation of languages
according to a hypothesis of common origin; also called genealogical classiﬁca-
tion. Languages which are genetically related have a common ancestor. The
terminology of description derives from that of the family tree of human
relationships. Non-genetic links between languages can also be established using
comparative linguistic techniques.
Geneva School (1)
In linguistics, the name given to those who have developed
the views of Ferdinand de Saussure (see Saussurean), who taught linguistics
at the University of Geneva between 1906 and 1911. Scholars such as Charles
Bally (1865–1947) have expounded Saussurean theories and applied them to
several new areas, e.g. literary language.
(2)
In language acquisition, the name given to those who have developed the
views of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896–1980). Particular attention has
been paid to experimental techniques designed to extend Piaget’s observations
on language development in children to a wider range of data and contexts
in a wider range of languages.

genitive (adj./n.) (gen, GEN)
One of the forms taken by a noun phrase (often
a single noun or pronoun) in languages which express grammatical rela-
tionships by means of inﬂections. The genitive case (‘the genitive’) typically
expresses a possessive relationship (e.g. the boy’s book), or some other similarly
‘close’ connection (e.g. a summer’s day); but there is a great deal of variation
between languages in the way this case is used. The term may also apply to
constructions formally related to the case form, as in the postmodifying
genitive with of in English, e.g. the car of the general (⇒ The general’s car). In
English linguistics, particular attention has been paid to the problems caused
by the distribution of the genitive ending, as in a book of my brother’s and
the King of England’s hat. See group (2).
genre (n.)
In sociolinguistics, discourse analysis and stylistics, the gen-
eralization of a term well established in artistic and literary criticism for an
identiﬁable category of literary composition (e.g. poetry, detective story). The
extended use refers to any formally distinguishable variety that has achieved a
level of general recognition, whether in speech or writing, such as commercial
advertising, jokes, and sermons. A genre imposes several identiﬁable charac-
teristics on a use of language, notably in relation to subject-matter, purpose
(e.g. narrative, allegory, satire), textual structure, form of argumentation, and level
of formality. Subgenres can also be identiﬁed, as with types of novel or types of
news story. See also text.
geographical dialect
see geographical linguistics
geographical linguistics
The study of languages and dialects in terms of
their regional distribution is sometimes collectively referred to by this label,
though the terms dialectology and areal linguistics are more commonly
used. Geographical dialect is an alternative term for ‘regional dialect’.
geolinguistics (n.)
A branch of linguistics which studies the geographical
distribution of languages throughout the world, with reference to their polit-
ical, economic and cultural status. More narrowly, the term is used in linguistics
for an approach which combines the insights of dialect geography, urban
dialectology and human geography in a sociolinguistically informed dialecto-
logy. This approach examines in particular the spread of innovations in a
geographical area, using the notion of the linguistic variable.

gestural phonology
A term used in phonetics and phonology for a model
of speech production in which the underlying units are represented by classes
of functionally equivalent movement patterns (gestures). A particular gesture
gradually increases its inﬂuence on the shape of the vocal tract, reaches a
peak, then gradually decreases its inﬂuence. segments are modelled as sets of
gestures, which have their own intrinsic temporal structure allowing them to
overlap in time when executed, the degree of overlap being controlled through
210
genitive

their co-production by an underlying ‘speech plan’. The theory brings linguistic
units into a closer connection with the underlying motor processes of speech
production, and claims to give a unifying account of apparently unrelated speech
processes that would be separated by feature-based phonology, such as
coarticulation, allophony, alternations, assimilation, and other aspects
of connected speech.
gesture (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology for a matrix of features speci-
fying a particular characteristic of a segment. For example, an ‘oral gesture’
would specify all supraglottal characteristics (such as place and manner
of articulation), and a ‘laryngeal gesture’ would specify characteristics of
phonation. The notion is particularly used in dependency phonology, where
‘categorial’, ‘articulatory’ and ‘initiatory’ gestures are distinguished. Gestures,
in turn, are analysed into subgestures; for example, the initiatory gesture is
analysed into the subgestures of glottal stricture, airstream direction and
airstream source. See also articulatory phonology, tier.
(2)
In gestural phonology, an interval of activation in the stream of speech.
Gestures are planned actions, serially ordered, speciﬁed dynamically (e.g. in
terms of articulatory force and stiffness), with an intrinsic duration, and
context-free.
ghost segment
In phonology, a segment in a representation which has a
phonological effect, but which either never appears in surface structure or
surfaces only in restricted contexts; also called a phantom segment. Examples
include Polish yers and English epenthetic vowels.
given (adj.)
A term used by some linguists in a two-part analysis of utter-
ances in terms of information structure; ‘given’ information is opposed to
new. (The contrast between focus and presupposition makes an analogous
distinction.) ‘Given’ refers to information already supplied by the previous
linguistic context whereas ‘new’ information, as its name suggests, has not
been previously supplied. Given information will usually be relatively unstressed
within the tone unit: e.g. in the sequence A: What are you looking at? B: I’m
looking at a book, all but the ﬁnal phrase is given; in A: What are you doing? B:
I’m looking at a book, the context shows that only the ﬁrst part of the sentence
is given. Complications arise when the new information is prosodically ‘spread’
throughout a tone unit, however, as in your cóusin’s had a bàby, and analyses in
these terms are not without controversy.
glide (n.) (1)
A term used in phonetics to refer to a transitional sound as
the vocal organs move towards or away from an articulation (on-glide
and off-glide respectively). An example is the [j] glide heard in some pronun-
ciations of words like tune, viz. [tjupn].
(2)
Also in phonetics, the term is used for a vowel where there is an audible
change in quality. Diphthongs and triphthongs are both types of glide (or
gliding vowels).
(3)
In the study of intonation, the term is sometimes used to describe a tone
which involves a change of pitch level. The notion thus includes falling,
rising, rising-falling, etc. tones.
glide

gliding vowel
see diphthong, glide (2)
global (adj.)
A term used in generative linguistic theory in the early 1970s
to refer to a type of rule (a global rule) which extends over entire derivations,
or parts of derivations, and cannot be satisfactorily stated in terms of trans-
formational operations that deﬁne the conditions of well-formedness on
individual phrase-markers or pairs of adjacent phrase-markers in a derivation.
Global rules (or ‘global derivational constraints’) thus contrast with phrase-
structure and transformational rules, as traditionally understood: they
deﬁne the conditions of well-formedness on conﬁgurations of corresponding
nodes in non-adjacent phrase-markers. Several topics in phonology, syntax
and semantics have been analysed in these terms (e.g. case agreement,
contracted forms, placement of contrastive stress).
glossematics (n.)
An approach to language developed primarily by Louis
Hjelmslev (1899–1965) and associates at the Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen
in the mid-1930s (the Copenhagen School). The novel name was a reﬂection
of the originality of the school’s intention to develop a theory which would
be applicable, not just for language, but for general study of the humanities
(‘semiology’, the study of symbolic systems in general; see semiotics). Lan-
guage, in this view, was seen as one kind of symbolic system, whose special
features would be clariﬁed only when it was compared with other, non-linguistic
symbolic systems (e.g. logic, dancing). The philosophical and logical basis of
glossematic theory, especially as formalized by Hjelmslev in his Prolegomena
to a Theory of Language, published in 1943, presenting language as a purely
deductive system, is its most distinctive feature. The irreducible and invariant
units established by this procedure were called glossemes. Proponents of the
theory were glossematicians.
glosseme (n.)
A term used in glossematics to refer to the abstract minimal
invariant forms set up by the theory as the bases of explanation in all areas of
linguistic analysis.
glossogenetics (n.)
A term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to the study
of the origins and development of language, both in the child and in the
human race. It involves a wide range of contributing sciences, including biology,
anthropology, psychology, semiotics, neurology and primatology, as well as
linguistics.
glossographia (n.)
see glossolalia
glossolalia (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the phenomenon of
‘speaking in tongues’, as practised by members of various religious groups.
From a sociolinguistic perspective, glossolalic speech has a unique function,
acting as a sign of glossolalist belief or as evidence of conversion, but lacking
conventional reference. Its formal linguistic structure is quite unlike that of
ordinary languages, being simpler and more repetitive (notwithstanding the claims
made that the speaker is articulating a real but unknown language). The written
equivalent is glossographia.
212
gliding vowel

glottal (adj.)
A term in the classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on the basis of
place of articulation: it is a sound made in the larynx, due to the closure
or narrowing of the glottis, the aperture between the vocal folds. The audible
release of a complete closure at the glottis is known as a glottal stop, transcribed
[ˆ]. This is often used in English; e.g. it may be heard before a forcefully
articulated vowel, as in are you, or between adjacent vowels as in co-operate.
In several accents of English (e.g. those inﬂuenced by Cockney) the sound has
phonemic status, being used in some positions where received pronunciation
has a voiceless plosive ([t] and [k] especially), e.g. bottle /b∞ˆl/ for /b∞tl/.
Varying degrees of audible friction may also originate at the glottis, as in
whispered speech, or the [h] sound in English. Other glottal effects, due to the
mode of vibration of the vocal folds, are an important feature of speech sounds,
such as voicing and pitch variation, and breathy and creaky phonation.
Glottalization is a general term for any articulation involving a simultaneous
glottal constriction, especially a glottal stop. In English, glottal stops are
often used in this way to reinforce a voiceless plosive at the end of a word, as in
what? [w∞tˆ]. However, if the opening of the glottis is delayed until after the
release of the glottalized sound, a different sound effect is created. Such sounds,
made while the glottis is closed, are produced without the direct involvement of
air from the lungs. Air is compressed in the mouth or pharynx above the glottal
closure, and released while the breath is still held: the resultant sounds produced
in this glottalic airstream mechanism are known as ejective sounds. They
are also called ‘glottalic’ or glottalized sounds (though the latter term is often
restricted to sounds where the glottal feature is a secondary articulation).
They are transcribed with a following raised glottal stop sign or apostrophe, as
in [p’], [t’], [s’]. In English, such sounds have only stylistic force (as when
I think might be said in a clipped precise manner, producing an ejective [k’]
in think), but in languages like Quechua and Hausa ejective consonants are
used as phonemes. A further category of sounds involving a glottalic airstream
mechanism is known as implosive.
In Chomsky and Halle’s distinctive feature theory of phonology, glottal
constrictions constitute one of the types of sound set up to handle variations
in place of articulation (cavity features). Glottal constrictions are formed by
narrowing the glottis beyond its neutral position, as in the above sounds. See
Chomskyan.

glottochronology (n.)
A term used in linguistics, referring to the quantiﬁca-
tion of the extent to which languages have diverged from a common source.
Using a technique known as lexicostatistics, one studies the extent to which
the hypothetically related languages share certain basic words (cognates) and
deduces from this the distance in time since the languages separated. The theory
and methods involved are in limited use, and are highly controversial.

different university centres. It originally united adherents to the extended stand-
ard theory, and is now oriented towards government-binding theory and
the minimalist programme.
goal (n.)
A term used by some linguists as part of the grammatical analysis
of a sentence: it refers to the entity which is affected by the action of the verb,
e.g. The cat caught a mouse. Several other terms have been used for this idea,
e.g. ‘patient’, ‘recipient’. In localistic theories of meaning, an entity takes a
‘path’ from a ‘source’ to a ‘goal’. In case grammar, it refers to the place to
which something moves. See actor–action–goal, semantic role.
God’s truth
A phrase coined in the 1950s to characterize one of two extreme
states of mind of a hypothetical linguist who sets up a description of lin-
guistic data; opposed to hocus-pocus. A ‘God’s truth’ linguist approaches
data with the expectation that the language has a ‘real’ structure which is
waiting to be uncovered. The assumption is that, if one’s procedure of analysis
is logical and consistent, the same description would always emerge from the
same data, any uncertainty being the result of defective observation or logic on
the part of the analyst. In a hocus-pocus approach, by contrast, no such assump-
tion is made.
govern (v.) (1)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to a process of
syntactic linkage whereby one word (or word-class) requires a speciﬁc
morphological form of another word (or class). For example, prepositions
in Latin are said to ‘govern’ nouns, making a certain case form obligatory (e.g.
ad plus accusative). The notion is, accordingly, not readily applicable to a
language like English, where case endings are few – to say that, in the man
kicked the ball, kicked ‘governs’ the ball is true only in a loose semantic sense
(and, even then, it is debatable whether this is a valid notion of government,
when the relationship between other elements is considered: almost any pairs
of elements, e.g. the man and kicked, might be said to be displaying govern-
ment, in this sense). The term is usually contrasted with agreement, where the
form taken by one word requires a corresponding form in another.
(2)
In generative grammar (see Aspects model), a rule is said to be gov-
erned or ungoverned depending on whether it does or does not have lexical
exceptions. For example, because not all active transitive sentences take the
passive (e.g. They have a car, The hat suits you), the passivization rule would
be said to be ‘governed’. An example of an ungoverned rule is reﬂexivization

looked

(e.g. I shaved myself, etc.). In later generative grammar, the conditions which
determine whether one constituent governs another were made more explicit.
When several possible nodes c-command a constituent, the governor is the
lowest of these nodes in the tree (i.e. the ‘minimal’ node), as long as there is
no intervening noun phrase or S-bar (cf. the conventions of X-bar syntax).
For example, in the tree representing looked at John (see ﬁgure), both looked
and at c-command John; but only at is said to ‘govern’ John (looked John not
being possible), i.e. to be the governing node. Governing nodes are noun, verb,
adjective, preposition, tense and possessive.
(3)
In relation to government-binding theory, a governing category is the
minimal structure (noun phrase or sentence) within which the relationships
of binding obtain. X is the governing category for Y, where X is N, V, A, P,
or AGR, if and only if X and Y are dominated by exactly the same maximal
projections (full phrasal categories). When an empty category is governed by a
co-indexed category, it is said to be ‘antecedent-governed’ (important for the
empty category principle).
(4)
In dependency grammar, the governor refers to the superordinate node
in a dependency tree, which ‘governs’ or ‘controls’ a set of ‘dependent’ nodes.
Each combination of governor and dependent deﬁnes a speciﬁc structural rela-
tionship. For example, the verb is seen as the governor of the noun phrases
occurring in clause structure, and each verb/noun-phrase combination spe-
ciﬁes a syntactic relation, e.g. subject, indirect object. In the phrase up
the tree, up governs tree, and tree governs the. Because of the possibility of
ambiguity with sense (1) above, some linguists use the term ‘controller’ instead
of ‘governor’.

government-binding theory (GB)
A model of grammar, a descendent of
extended standard theory and ultimately of classical transformational
grammar; also called government and binding theory. It assumes that sentences
have three main levels of structure: D-structure, S-structure and logical
form. S-structure is derived from D-structure, and logical form from S-structure,
by a single transformation, move alpha, which essentially means move any-
thing anywhere. Various so-called sub-theories interact with this to allow just
the right structures to be generated. The main sub-theories are X-bar theory,
theta theory, case theory, binding theory, bounding theory, control theory
and government theory. Because of the way these sub-theories interact, GB
is commonly described as a ‘modular’ theory. Proponents of GB suggest that
essentially the same principles of syntax are operative in all languages, although
they can take a slightly different form in different languages. For this reason, GB
is often referred to as the ‘principles and parameters’ approach.
government phonology
A model of non-linear phonology in which the
notion of government is central; also called government-based phonology or
government phonology
215

government and charm phonology. ‘Government’ is here deﬁned in terms of
headedness – a binary asymmetric relation holding between two skeletal posi-
tions. Certain segments within syllable structure are seen to have governing
properties, and are associated to governing skeletal positions. Other segments
are governable, and are associated to skeletal positions that are governees.
Headedness is seen as local (i.e. between adjacent segments) and directional
(head-initial). Syllabic constituents are thus deﬁned as head-initial governing
domains. Government across constituent boundaries is called ‘interconstituent
government’. Proper government is a stronger form of government which asserts
that the governor may not itself be governed, and that the domain of proper
government may not include a governing domain. The approach is inﬂuenced by
government-binding theory, and advocates a constraining of phonology
through the use of principles and parameters.
government theory
One of the (sub-)theories of government-binding theory.
Its main principle is the empty category principle, which restricts the posi-
tions from which movement can occur by requiring traces to be closely asso-
ciated with (or be governed by) either a lexical category or a co-indexed
category (their antecedent).

gradability (n.)
A term used in grammar and semantics to refer to an analysis
of the sense relationship between lexical items in terms of the possibility of
comparison. In semantics, gradable terms are best illustrated by such opposites
as big/small, high/low (see antonyms). Ungradable terms can be illustrated by
single/married, north/south, etc. In grammar, the term is used to refer to various
types of grammatical modiﬁcation which can be used as criteria for compar-
ative meanings, e.g. a piece/bit/chunk of . . . , a very/slightly/extremely . . .
gradable (adj.)

gradation (n.) (1)
In grammar, the relationship between the forms of adject-
ives or adverbs when used in the expression of degrees of comparison.
Languages typically express positive, equative, comparative and superlative
forms, using morphological (e.g. English -er, -est) or syntactic (e.g. more,
most) means.
(2)
In historical linguistics, the relationship between verb forms based on
variations in the root vowel, as in sing, sang, sung; more explicitly called vowel
gradation or ablaut.
gradience (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to areas of language
where there are no clear boundaries between sets of analytic categories. pho-
netic continua provide clear examples (such as the set of possible contrasts
between falling and rising intonation patterns), but the term is also found
in semantics (as in the study of continua, such as colour terms, or gradable
antonyms) and in grammar (where the boundaries between word-classes are
not clear-cut; e.g., noun-like words such as rich, London, smoking, someone
make it difﬁcult to circumscribe the class of nouns).

gradual (adj.)
A type of opposition recognized by Prague School phono-
logy, distinguished from privative and equipollent. A gradual opposition is
one where degrees of difference in a language are recognized along a scale of
some kind, as in a language with four front vowels /i/, /e/, /ε/ and /a/ where
(according to Nicolai Trubetskoy) it would not be desirable to analyse the four
degrees of vowel height in terms of privative pairs, such as ‘high’ v. ‘low’.
grammar (n.)
A central term in linguistics, but one which covers a wide
range of phenomena, being used both in mass noun and count noun senses (as
‘grammar in general’ and ‘a grammar in particular’). Several types of grammar
can be distinguished.
(1)
A descriptive grammar is, in the ﬁrst instance, a systematic description
of a language as found in a sample of speech or writing (e.g. in a corpus of
material, or as elicited from native-speakers). Depending on one’s theoretical
background, it may go beyond this and make statements about the language as
a whole, and in so far as these statements are explicit and predictive of the
speaker’s competence the grammar can be said to be ‘descriptively adequate’
and generative. In the older tradition, ‘descriptive’ is in contrast to the pre-
scriptive or normative approach of grammarians who attempted to establish
rules for the socially or stylistically correct use of language. Comprehens-
ive descriptions of the syntax and morphology of a language are known as
reference grammars or grammatical handbooks (such as those produced in the
twentieth century by the North European grammarians, e.g. the Dane, Otto
Jespersen (1860–1943), and more recently by Randolph Quirk et al. (see Quirk
grammar)).
(2)
A theoretical grammar goes beyond the study of individual languages, using
linguistic data as a means of developing theoretical insights into the nature of
language as such, and into the categories and processes needed for successful
linguistic analysis. Such insights include the distinction between ‘deep grammar’
and ‘surface grammar’, the notion of ‘grammatical categories’ and ‘gram-
matical meaning’, and the study of ‘grammatical relations’ (the relationship
between a verb and its dependents, such as ‘subject of’, ‘direct object of’). In so
far as grammar concentrates on the study of linguistic forms (their structure,
distribution, etc.), it may be referred to as formal grammar (as opposed to
‘notional grammar’); but formal grammar also refers to the use of the for-
malized techniques of logic and mathematics in the analysis of language.
(3)
Other general notions include the distinction between diachronic and
synchronic grammars, based on whether or not grammars introduce a histor-
ical dimension into their analysis. Comparative grammar, which compares the
forms of languages (or states of a language), relies on a combination of theoret-
ical and descriptive methods. A pedagogical or teaching grammar is a grammar
designed speciﬁcally for the purposes of teaching or learning a (foreign) language,
or for developing one’s awareness of the mother-tongue.
(4)
The phrase traditional grammar is an attempt to summarize the range of
attitudes and methods found in the prelinguistic era of grammatical study. The
grammar
217

term traditional, accordingly, is found with reference to many periods, such
as the Roman and Greek grammarians, Renaissance grammars, and (especially)
the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century school grammars, in Europe and America.
It is usually used with a critical (‘non-scientiﬁc’) implication, despite the fact
that many antecedents of modern linguistics can be found in early grammars.
Criticism is directed primarily at the prescriptive and proscriptive recom-
mendations of authors, as opposed to the descriptive emphasis of linguistic studies.
(5)
In a restricted sense (the traditional sense in linguistics, and the usual popular
interpretation of the term), grammar refers to a level of structural organization
which can be studied independently of phonology and semantics, and generally
divided into the branches of syntax and morphology. In this sense, grammar
is the study of the way words, and their component parts, combine to form
sentences. It is to be contrasted with a general conception of the subject, where
grammar is seen as the entire system of structural relationships in a language,
as in such titles as stratiﬁcational grammar, systemic grammar and (espe-
cially) generative grammar. Here, ‘grammar’ subsumes phonology and semant-
ics as well as syntax, traditionally regarded as separate linguistic levels. ‘A
grammar’, in this sense, is a device for generating a ﬁnite speciﬁcation of the
sentences of a language. In so far as a grammar deﬁnes the total set of rules
possessed by a speaker, it is a grammar of the speaker’s competence (com-
petence grammar). In so far as a grammar is capable of accounting for only the
sentences a speaker has actually used (as found in a sample of output, or corpus),
it is a performance grammar. The study of performance grammars, in a psycho-
linguistic context, goes beyond this, however, attempting to deﬁne the various
psychological, neurological and physiological stages which enter into the produc-
tion and perception of speech. Investigations which go beyond the study of an
individual language, attempting to establish the deﬁning (universal) character-
istics of human language in general, have as their goal a universal grammar.
Students of grammar are grammarians, and they carry out a grammatical ana-
lysis (the term here having no implications of well-formedness, as it has in
the notion of grammaticality). When it is necessary to differentiate entities
in one’s analysis as belonging to a grammatical level of description as opposed
to some other (e.g. semantic, phonological), the term ‘grammatical’ is often
used attributively, as in ‘grammatical category’ (e.g. gender, case, voice),
‘grammatical gender’ (as opposed to ‘natural gender’), ‘grammatical forma-
tive/item/unit’ (e.g. an inﬂectional ending), ‘grammatical subject/object . . .’
(as opposed to ‘logical’ or ‘semantic’ subjects/objects . . . ), ‘grammatical word’
(as opposed to lexical word). When a semantic contrast is expressed using
grammatical forms, it is said to be grammaticalized (or grammaticized), a pro-
cess often seen in historical linguistics. An example of grammaticalization
(grammaticization) is the use of the motion verb go, as in She is going to
London, which has become a marker of tense in It’s going to rain. See also
application (2), arc, constituent, core, discourse, fuzzy, general (1).

grammaticality (n.)
In linguistics, the conformity of a sentence (or part of
a sentence) to the rules deﬁned by a speciﬁc grammar of a language. A pre-
ceding asterisk is commonly used to indicate that a sentence is ungrammatical,
i.e. incapable of being accounted for by the rules of a grammar. In practice,
deciding whether a sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical may cause difﬁculty,
e.g. in cases such as The bus he got off was a red one, where native-speakers
vary in their judgements. In generative linguistics, the view is taken that a
grammar is set up in the ﬁrst instance to draw a dividing line between those
sentences which are clearly grammatical and those which are clearly ungram-
matical. Once this has been done, the cases of uncertainty can be investigated,
and a decision made as to whether they can be incorporated into the grammar
as they stand, and without further modiﬁcation being introduced into the gram-
mar. If they can, these sentences are thereby deﬁned as grammatical, i.e. the
grammar recognizes them as such. If not, they will be said to be ungrammatical,
with reference to that grammar. Sentences felt to be awkward are identiﬁed in
writing using a preﬁxed question mark (or two question marks, in even more
marginal cases).
An alternative term for ‘grammatical’, in this context, is well formed (v. ill
formed): grammars adjudicate on the ‘well-formedness’ of sentences. Such deci-
sions have nothing to do with the meaning or acceptability of sentences. A
sentence in this view may be well formed, but nonsensical (as in Noam Chomsky’s
famous Colourless green ideas sleep furiously); it may also be well formed but
unacceptable (for reasons of stylistic inappropriateness, perhaps).
It should be emphasized that no social value judgement is implied by the use of
‘grammatical’, and this therefore contrasts with some popular uses of the term,
as when sentences are said to be ungrammatical because they do not conform
to the canons of the standard language (as in the use of double negatives,
such as I haven’t done nothing). There is no prescriptive implication in the
above use in linguistics.

graph (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the smallest discrete
segment in a stretch of writing or print – analogous to the notion of the phone
in phonetics. The present line of type is composed of such graphs as t, T, h, e,
and so on, as well as the punctuation marks. The linguistic analysis of these
graphs into graphemes is the province of graphology.

219

grapheme (n.)
The minimal contrastive unit in the writing system of a
language; usually enclosed in angle brackets. The grapheme <a>, for example,
is realized as several allographs A, a, a, etc., which may be seen as units in
complementary distribution (e.g. upper case restricted to sentence-initial
position, proper names, etc.), or in free variation (as in some styles of hand-
writing), just as in phonemic analysis. ‘Grapheme analysis’ is the main business
of graphemics (or graphology).
graphetics (n.)
A term used by some linguists, on analogy with phonetics,
for the analysis of the graphic substance of written or printed language. For
example, it is theoretically possible to deﬁne a universal set of graphetic fea-
tures which enter into the formation of distinctive letter shapes. There are also
several properties of the written medium which exercise a considerable inﬂuence
on communication, e.g. colour, size of writing or print, spacing. There is plainly
an overlap here with the ﬁeld of graphics and typography (and graphics is
in fact sometimes used as a label for this ﬁeld). So far little analysis of texts
in these terms has taken place, and the relationship between graphetics and
graphology remains unclear.
graphics (n.)
see graphetics
graphic substance
A term used by some linguists to refer to the written or
printed form of language seen as a set of physically deﬁnable visual properties,
i.e. marks on a surface. The analogous term for speech is phonic substance.
The linguistic analysis of these graphic or graphetic features is sometimes
referred to as graphology, on analogy with phonology.
graphology (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the writing system
of a language – on analogy with phonology. A graphological analysis would
be concerned to establish the minimal contrastive units of visual language
– deﬁned as graphemes, graphemic features, or without using emic terms –
using similar techniques to those used in phonological analysis. Graphology in
this sense has nothing to do with the analysis of handwriting to determine the
psychological characteristics of the writer – an activity for which the same term
is often popularly used.
grave /ìrwpv/ (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle
(see Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to
handle variations in place of articulation; its opposite is acute. Grave
sounds are deﬁned articulatorily and acoustically, as those involving a
peripheral articulation in the vocal tract, and a concentration of acoustic
energy in the lower frequencies. back vowels and labial and velar con-
sonants are [+grave]; front vowels and dental, alveolar and palatal
consonants are [−grave].
Great Vowel Shift

greed (n.)
In the minimalist programme, a general economy constraint
which allows the movement of an element only if it satisﬁes the requirements
220
grapheme

of the moved element. For example, an item can be moved to a particular
position only if the morphological properties of the item would not otherwise
be satisﬁed in the derivation. An element may not move if its only motivation
is to satisfy the requirements of some other element. See also enlightened
self-interest.

Grimm’s law
In historical linguistics and philology, a sound law ﬁrst
worked out in 1822 by Jakob Grimm (1785–1863) which shows the regular
way in which the Germanic sound system diverged from that of Indo-
European. Nine sets of correspondences were shown, which fell into a clear
phonetic pattern. Voiced aspirates (a term which includes both aspirated
plosives and fricatives) in Indo-European became voiced plosives in Ger-
manic; voiced plosives became voiceless plosives; and voiceless plosives became
voiceless aspirates. These relationships explain, for example, why words which
begin with /p/ in Latin, Greek or Sanskrit generally have /f/ in English (e.g. pater
– father). Certain exceptions to this law were explained by later philologists. See
also Verner’s law.
grinding (n.)
In semantics, a term sometimes used in analysing the process
of sense extension, notably that which creates uncountable nouns from
count nouns. The metaphor is that of a universal grinder machine which would
turn a chicken, for example, into the mass noun chicken. The analysis of ground
nouns aims to establish which types of noun allow conceptual grinding in a
language (e.g. animal meat), and the extent to which languages employ different
grammatical means to encode grinding phenomena.
groove (n.)
A term sometimes used in phonetics to refer to a type of fricative
where the tongue is slightly hollowed (or grooved) along its central line, the
passage of air producing a sound with a higher frequency than in other fric-
atives. In English, [s], [z], [à] and [è] are ‘groove fricatives’. In slit (or ‘ﬂat’)
fricatives (e.g. [f], [θ]), there is no such groove (or grooving). See also cupping.
grounding (n.)
A term used in generative phonology for the relating
of a phonological rule or constraint to a phonetically plausible source. For
example, in optimality theory it refers to a type of co-occurrence
constraint which is phonetically motivated (grounded). Sympathetic constraints
require that a feature X must appear when a feature Y appears (e.g. the
fronting of the tongue body with the advancement of the tongue root).
Antagonistic constraints require that X must not appear when Y appears (e.g.
the fronting of the tongue body with the retraction of the tongue root).
Examples such as the likely co-occurrence of nasality with voicing suggest the
sympathetic constraint that ‘nasals must be voiced’; and examples such as the
rarity of nasality co-occurring with liquids and fricatives suggest the antag-
onistic constraint that ‘nasals must not be continuant’.

group (n.) (1)
A term used in Hallidayan grammar to refer to a unit on
the rank scale intermediate between clause and word. For example, in the
sentence The car was parked in the street, the car is a ‘nominal group’, was
parked is a ‘verbal group’, and in the street is an ‘adverbial group’. The term
phrase is equivalent in most other approaches. See also preposition, stress,
tone group.
(2)
A group genitive is a general designation for the English construction
where the genitive ending is added to the last element in a noun phrase
containing post-modiﬁcation or co-ordination, e.g. the University of London’s
grant, Morecambe and Wise’s humour.

guttural (adj./n.)
In some models of feature geometry, a node proposed to
represent a natural class of sounds articulated between the larynx and the
upper pharynx (glottal, pharyngeal, and uvular sounds). In some approaches,
it is characterized by the feature [guttural]; in other cases by [pharyngeal]. The
term has a history of use in the description of Semitic languages, but it will
also be heard in popular, impressionistic accounts of back consonant sounds
(or languages which contain such sounds, ‘gutturals’) – a usage (e.g. ‘Welsh is a
very guttural language’) which has no status in phonetics or linguistics.
222
ground noun

H
habitual (adj.) (hab)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of aspect,
referring to a situation in which an action is viewed as lasting for an extended
period of time. English has a habitual aspect in the past tense, using used to,
and habitual meaning is often expressed lexically, using adverbials (e.g.
often, frequently). Many habitual uses express repeated action (I visit my aunt
regularly), and in this function are often described as iterative, but the habitual
is often non-iterative, as in A castle used to stand at the top of that cliff.

Hallidayan (adj.)
Characteristic of, or a follower of, the linguistic principles
of the British linguist, M(ichael) A(lexander) K(irkwood) Halliday (b. 1925).
Much of Halliday’s early thinking can be traced back to the teaching of J. R.
Firth, and his approach is accordingly often called ‘neo-Firthian’. His original
conception of language, scale-and-category grammar, was published in
article form in 1961: this contained a model of language organization in terms
of levels of substance, form (grammar and lexis) and context, and a
theoretical model of grammar in terms of three scales (of rank, exponence
and delicacy) and four categories (of unit, class, structure and system).
The central role of the last two has led to an alternative label for this approach
– ‘system-structure theory’. In the 1970s, the notion of ‘system’ became the
central construct in an alternative model known as ‘systemic’ grammar: here,
grammar is seen as a network of interrelated systems of classes; entry condi-
tions deﬁne the choices which can be made from within each system, and these
choices become increasingly speciﬁc (‘delicate’) as the analysis proceeds. The
application of Hallidayan ideas has been widespread, e.g. in text analysis (see
cohesion), stylistics (see register) and language acquisition.
hand conﬁguration

guage, to refer to a separate tier for handshape and orientation.

hapax legomenon
In lexicology, a word which occurs only once in a text,
author, or extant corpus of a language, often shortened to hapax. The expres-
sion is from Greek, ‘something said only once’. The word following hapax in
the headword of this entry is itself a hapax in the present book.
haplology (n.)
A term used in phonology, in both synchronic and dia-
chronic contexts, to refer to the omission of some of the sounds occurring in a
sequence of similar articulations, as when cyclists is pronounced /csa}kl}sp/,
library /cla}br}/, etc. Some psycholinguists also use the term to refer to a
tongue-slip where an omission of this kind has taken place, e.g. running jump
becoming rump.
hard consonant
An impressionistic term sometimes used in the phonetic
descriptions of particular languages, referring to a consonant which lacks
palatalization; also called a hard sign. Russian is a language which has
several such hard (as opposed to soft) consonants. In Russian, the W symbol
(‘hard sign’) marks this lack of palatalization on the preceding consonant.

harmonic (n.)
In acoustic phonetics, a regular (periodic) waveform accom-
panying a fundamental frequency, which helps to identify a complex tone;
also called an overtone. Harmonics are whole-number multiples of the funda-
mental frequency; for example, if the fundamental is 200 Hz, the harmonics will
be at 400 Hz, 600 Hz, and so on. The harmonics are numbered in sequence,
and in phonetics the numbering starts with the fundamental: in this example,
200 Hz would be the ‘ﬁrst harmonic’, 400 Hz the ‘second harmonic’ (the ‘ﬁrst
overtone’) and so on. The combination of a fundamental frequency and the
amplitude of its various harmonics combine to give a sound its characteristic
tone and quality. It should be noted that, in music, the ﬁrst harmonic is tradi-
tionally regarded as the ﬁrst multiple of the fundamental, so that (in the above
example) 400 Hz would be the ‘ﬁrst harmonic’.
harmonic phonology
In phonology, an approach which recognizes three levels
of representation working in parallel: morphophonemic (‘M-level’), word/
syllable tactics (‘W-level’), and phonetic (‘P-level’). Each level is character-
ized by a set of well-formedness statements (‘tactics’) and a set of unordered
‘intralevel’ rules which collectively deﬁne the paths an input representation has
to follow in order to achieve maximum conformity to the tactics. This maximal
well-formedness is called ‘harmony’. The levels are related by ‘inter-level’ rules.
The approach avoids the traditional conception of the organization of a gen-
erative grammar in which each level of representation is seen to precede or
follow another (as would be found in the ordered steps within a derivation).
harmony (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology to refer to the way the articu-
lation of one phonological unit is inﬂuenced by (is ‘in harmony’ with) another
unit in the same word or phrase. An analogous notion is that of assimilation.
224
hapax legomenon

The two main processes are consonant harmony and vowel harmony. In the
typical case of vowel harmony, for example, such as is found in Turkish or
Hungarian, all the vowels in a word share certain features – for instance, they
are all articulated with the front of the tongue, or all are rounded. The
subsets of vowels which are affected differently by harmonic processes are
harmonic sets. Disharmony (or disharmonicity) occurs when a vowel from set A
is used (e.g. by sufﬁxation) in words which otherwise have set B, thus forming
a harmonic island (if transparent) or a new harmonic span (if opaque). The
span within which harmony operates (usually the word) is the harmonic domain.
See also harmonic phonology.
(2)
In optimality theory, the measurement of the overall goodness of a form
given a constraint ranking.
hash (adj./n.)
The symbol #, also sometimes called a hash mark or double cross,
used especially in generative linguistics to represent the boundary of a string
or a phonological word.
head (n.) (1)
A term used in the grammatical description of some types
of phrase (endocentric phrases) to refer to the central element which is
distributionally equivalent to the phrase as a whole; sometimes abbreviated
as H. Such constructions are sometimes referred to as headed (as opposed to
non-headed) or as head phrases (HP). Headedness also determines any relation-
ships of concord or government in other parts of the phrase or sentence.
For example, the head of the noun phrase a big man is man, and it is the
singular form of this item which relates to the co-occurrence of singular verb
forms, such as is, walks, etc.; the head of the verb phrase has put is put, and it
is this verb which accounts for the use of object and adverbial later in the
sentence (e.g. put it there). In phrases such as men and women, either item could
be the head. Since the early 1980s, the term has also been extended to the
analysis of word-formation, such as in compounds: the head of a word is
the element which determines the grammatical properties of the whole word. In
generalized phrase-structure grammar, the term is used in a more abstract
way, as a device which enables one to identify a cluster of related feature
speciﬁcations which need to be referred to for a particular purpose (such as
N, V, AUX, PER (= person) and slash). The head-feature convention, in this
context, refers to a principle which determines the feature speciﬁcations of the
subconstituents of a phrase: it states that the head features on a mother category
are the same as the head features on any daughter which is a head. The head
parameter is a principle used in generative syntax, especially in relation to
universal grammar, which concerns the position of heads with respect to their
complements within phrases. It asserts that a language has the heads on the
same side in all phrases: head-ﬁrst languages are represented by English, e.g.
kick the ball (the verb in the verb phrase is to the left of the noun phrase) and
in the box (the preposition in the prepositional phrase is to the left of the noun
phrase); head-last languages are represented by Japanese or Korean, where the
heads appear on the right (e.g. Korean Seoul-eseo ‘in Seoul’). In metrical
phonology, left-headed feet are those where the leftmost rhyme of the foot is
stressed; right-headed feet are those where the rightmost rhyme is stressed. In
head-marked metrical notation, these cases are distinguished by placing the
head
225

node representing the foot constituent geometrically above the head (i.e. on
the rhyme that is stressed), as follows:
(2)
Head is used in some analyses of tone group structure, referring to the
sequence of syllables between the ﬁrst stressed syllable and the nuclear tone;
for example, in the tone group there’s a com cpletely cnew arràngement/ the
head is -pletely new a-.
(3)
See chain (2).
head-driven phrase-structure grammar (HPSG)
A syntactic theory which
builds on the insights of generalized phrase-structure grammar, categorial
grammar and certain other approaches. A central feature is that categories
incorporate information about the categories with which they combine. The con-
sequence of this is that very few rules are necessary, all important syntactic and
semantic processes being driven by information contained in lexical entries.
For example, a single rule provides for all lexical category + complement struc-
tures. See also binding.

hedge (n./v.)
An application in pragmatics and discourse analysis of a general
sense of the word (‘to be non-committal or evasive’) to a range of items which
express a notion of imprecision or qualiﬁcation. Examples of hedging include
sort of, more or less, I mean, approximately, roughly. Hedges may also be used
in combination: something of the order of 10 per cent, more or less.
heightened subglottal pressure
One of the source features of sound set up by
Chomsky and Halle (see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of
phonology, to handle variations in subglottal pressure, as in the aspirated
stops of various languages, such as Hindi.
hertz (n.)

hesitation (n.)
The general sense of this term is used in linguistics, and
especially in psycholinguistics, where the phenomenon is subclassiﬁed into
types, and the signiﬁcance of ‘hesitation phenomena’ in terms of language-
processing is discussed. Types of hesitation include silence, ﬁlled pauses (e.g.
er, Japanese ano), elongated syllables (e.g. we-e-ll), repetitions (e.g. the-the-
thing . . . ), and so on. The distribution of these features is by no means ran-
dom in speech, and it has been hypothesized that they occur at points where the
speaker is planning new utterances. Based on the extent to which hesitations
coincide with the boundaries between grammatical, semantic, etc. consti-
tuents, the possibility has emerged that there may be more than one level
of planning (e.g. syntactic, semantic, interactional) in speech production. See
also pause.

heteronymy (n.)

are identical in form in one medium only (viz. speech or writing). Examples of
heteronyms would be the homographs row (sc. a boat) and row (sc. noise), or
the homophones threw and through.

heuristic (adj./n.)
An application in linguistics and phonetics of the general
use of this term in cybernetics, referring to a speciﬁc mode of investigation
adopted as part of a process of discovery or problem-solving. In linguistics, the
notion has been introduced mainly in the discussion of procedures of analysis,
where Bloomﬁeldian discovery procedures are contrasted with the formal
analyses of generative grammar. The term is also used in the looser sense
of a ‘working hypothesis’, used to suggest or eliminate a possible explanation
of events. A notion such as discourse, for example, cannot easily be given
a formal or operational deﬁnition, but it can be seen as a heuristic device (‘a
heuristic
227

heuristic’), and used as a pre-theoretical notion, thus enabling an investigation
to proceed.
hiatus (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to two adja-
cent vowels belonging to different syllables. Examples include seeing, neo and
way out. In such cases, the vowels are said to be ‘in hiatus’.
hidden Markov model
In automatic speech recognition, an approach which
uses a spectral model of a word, viewed as a Markov model of the acoustic
event (see Markov process). The pronunciation of a word, in all its variant
forms, can be seen as a stochastic process: that is, in a sequence of events
(pronunciation here being modelled as a sequence of ‘slices’ through a speech
spectrogram), the probabilities at each step depend on the outcome of previ-
ous steps. Each time the process is applied to the word, it generates a slightly
different acoustic speciﬁcation, within the limits of the model. Once a speech
recognizer has been provided with Markov models for the words it contains, it
can use these to evaluate the properties of a fresh speech event. When someone
speaks a word into the recognition system, the acoustic event can be treated as
if it were the output of a ‘hidden’ Markov model. The output of the model is
known (i.e. the event), but not the model itself (i.e. it is hidden), and the job of
the recognizer is to reconstruct it.
hierarchy (n.)
A term derived from taxonomic studies and applied in lin-
guistics to refer to any classiﬁcation of linguistic units which recognizes a
series of successively subordinate levels. Hierarchical structure can be illustrated
from any branch of linguistics, e.g. the analysis of a sentence into immediate
constituents, or the analysis of the lexicon into semantic ﬁelds of increas-
ing speciﬁcity (as in Roget’s Thesaurus). The relationship of inclusion which is
involved can be seen in analyses of linguistic structure where discourses are
said to ‘consist of’ sentences, which in turn consist of clauses or phrases; these
consist of words, which in turn consist of morphemes. The term has a special
status in relational grammar, as part of the phrase ‘accessibility hierarchy’,
and has also been used with reference to case grammar (‘case hierarchy’). In
some models of non-linear phonology, the ‘prosodic hierarchy’ shows the
relationship between mora, syllable, foot and word. See also Chomsky hier-
archy, structure, sonority.
hieratic /ha}vcrat}k/ (n.)
see demotic
high (adj.) (1)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle (see
Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to handle
variations in place of articulation (cavity features). High sounds are a type
of tongue-body feature, and deﬁned articulatorily as those produced by
raising the tongue above the level it holds in neutral position; close vowels
and palatal/velar consonants are [+high]. Its opposite is non-high [−high] or
low, referring to sounds produced without any such raising, as in open vowels
and front consonants.
(2)
A term which describes the more formal variety in diglossia; opposed
to ‘low’.

hiatus

higher category
A term used in generative grammar to refer to a category
which is introduced earlier than a further instance of the same category in a
tree-diagram representation. The ﬁrst instance of the category is seen to be
higher up the tree than the other instance(s). For example, in such sentences as
the idea that the man will resign surprises me, the following (partial) tree might
be used:
hocus-pocus
229
In this sentence, the ‘higher verb’ is surprise, and the ‘higher clause’ or ‘higher
sentence’ is the idea surprises me. Alternative terms are matrix and ‘super-
ordinate’. The usual term for the ‘lower’ verb/clause is embedded.

historical linguistics
A branch of linguistics which studies the development
of language and languages over time; also known as diachronic linguistics.
The data of study are identical to that of comparative philology, viz. the
extant records of older states of languages; but the methods and aims are not
the same. Historical linguistics uses the methods of the various schools of
synchronic linguistics (including sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics,
especially in considering the reasons for language change). One thus encounters
such subﬁelds as ‘historical phonology/morphology/syntax’, etc. It also aims
to relate its ﬁndings to general linguistic theory.
historic(al) present
In grammar, a term describing the use of a present tense
form while narrating events which happened in the past; for example, Three
weeks ago I’m walking down this road, when I see Smithers coming towards
me . . . This usage is common in contexts where the speaker wishes to convey a
sense of drama, immediacy or urgency.
HMC

hocus-pocus (adj.)

extreme states of mind in a hypothetical linguist who sets up a description of

linguistic data; opposed to God’s truth. ‘Hocus-pocus’ linguists approach
data in the expectation that they will have to impose an organization on it in
order to show structural patterns. Different linguists, on this view, could
approach the same data, and by virtue of their different backgrounds, intuitions,
procedures, etc., arrive at differing descriptions. In a ‘God’s truth’ approach,
by contrast, the aim is to demonstrate an underlying structure really present in
the data over which there could be no dispute.
hodiernal (adj.)
In grammar, a category which marks how far a situation is
from the moment of speaking (from Latin hodie ‘today’); opposed to prehodiernal.
For example, in many Bantu languages one verb form is used for ‘today’ events,
and another for ‘before today’ events, regardless of their current relevance.
hold (n./v.) (1)
A term used in describing the articulation of some types of
sound, where the vocal organs maintain their position for a deﬁnable period,
as in the closure (or holding) stage in the production of a plosive or a long
consonant (see length).
(2)
In the phonological analysis of sign language, a term referring to a
static functional unit; also called location. Holds are distinguished from dy-
namic units, known as movements.

holonymy (n.)
see meronymy
holophrase (n.)
A term used in language acquisition to refer to a grammat-
ically unstructured utterance, usually consisting of a single word, which is
characteristic of the earliest stage of language learning in children. Typical
holophrastic utterances include dada, allgone, more, there. Theoretical con-
troversy centres on the extent to which these utterances may be analysed
as sentences (‘one-word sentences’), or as a reduced version of a sentence,
whose other elements are ‘understood’ in the extralinguistic situation
(e.g. daddy means ‘there is daddy’, the there is being expressed by gesture,
tone of voice, etc.). Holophrasis is also sometimes identiﬁed in adult utterances
where there is no internal structural contrastivity, such as thanks, please,
sorry.
holophrasis (n.), holophrastic (adj.)

homograph (n.)
see homography
homography (n.) (1)
A term used in semantic analysis to refer to words
(i.e. lexemes) which have the same spelling but differ in meaning. Homographs
are a type of homonymy. Homography is illustrated from such pairs as wind
(sc. blowing) and wind (sc. a clock). When there is ambiguity on account of
this identity, a homographic clash or ‘conﬂict’ is said to have occurred.
(2)
The term homography is also used to refer to a type of orthography
(a homographic system) where there is a one-to-one correspondence between
symbols and sounds, as in a phonetic transcription, or the systematically
230
hodiernal

devised alphabets of some languages. In this sense, it is opposed to heter-
ography (a heterographic system), such as the spelling system of English, French,
etc.
homomorphic (adj.)
see mapping
homonym (n.)
see homonymy
homonymy (n.)
A term used in semantic analysis to refer to lexical items
which have the same form but differ in meaning. Homonyms are illustrated
from the various meanings of bear (= animal, carry) or ear (of body, of corn).
In these examples, the identity covers both spoken and written forms, but it
is possible to have partial homonymy (or heteronymy), where the identity is
within a single medium, as in homophony and homography. When there
is ambiguity between homonyms (whether non-deliberate or contrived, as in
riddles and puns), a homonymic clash or conﬂict is said to have occurred. In
semantic analysis, the theoretical distinction between homonymy and polysemy
(one form with different meanings) provides a problem which has attracted a
great deal of attention. See also construction (1).
homophene (n.)
see homopheny
homopheny (n.)
A term sometimes used in the linguistic study of deaf com-
munication, referring to words which are visually identical when seen on the
lips. Examples of homophenes are fan and van.
homophone (n.)
see homophony
homophony (n.)
A term used in semantic analysis to refer to words (i.e.
lexemes) which have the same pronunciation, but differ in meaning. Homo-
phones are a type of homonymy. Homophony is illustrated from such pairs as
threw/through and rode/rowed. When there is ambiguity on account of this
identity, a homophonic clash or conﬂict is said to have occurred.
homorganic (adj.)
A general term in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech
sounds, referring to sounds which are produced at the same place of articu-
lation, such as [p], [b] and [m]. Sounds involving independent articulations
may be referred to as heterorganic. Sounds involving adjacent, and thus to some
degree mutually dependent, articulations are also sometimes further distinguished
as ‘contiguous’.
honoriﬁc (adj./n.)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of some languages
(e.g. Japanese) to refer to syntactic or morphological distinctions used to
express levels of politeness or respect, especially in relation to the compared
social status of the participants. The notion should not be identiﬁed with form-
ality: honoriﬁc forms may also appear in non-formal contexts. Some use is
also made of the term with reference to functions other than the expression of
respect, such as courtesy, politeness, etc.

hortative (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in the grammatical analysis of
verbs, to refer to a type of modal meaning in which an exhortation is made.
An example of a hortative usage (‘a hortative’) is the ‘let us’ construction in
English (let us pray).
host (n.)
In grammar, a word or phrase to which an afﬁx or clitic is phono-
logically attached. For example, he is the host for ’s in he’s, and is is the host
for n’t in isn’t.
HP (head phrase)
see head
humanistic (adj.)
In foreign-language teaching, a term which characterizes
approaches which emphasize the need for the student to develop self-awareness,
sensitivity to the feelings of others, and a sense of human values. Such approaches
require students to be actively involved in understanding the processes of lan-
guage learning, as they work with a foreign language.
hybrid (adj./n.)
In historical linguistics, a word composed of elements
from different languages. An example of a hybrid term (‘a hybrid’) is television,
which comprises elements from both Latin and Greek.
hydronymy (n.)
In onomastics, the study of the names of rivers, lakes, and
other bodies of water. It is a branch of toponymy.
hypercorrection (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the movement of a
linguistic form beyond the point set by the variety of language that a speaker
has as a target; also called hypercorrectness, hyperurbanism or overcorrection.
The phenomenon usually takes place when speakers of a non-standard dialect
attempt to use the standard dialect and ‘go too far’, producing a version which
does not appear in the standard, e.g. putting a long /wp/ in place of a short /æ/ in
such words as cap, mat, etc. Analogous behaviour is encountered in second-
language learning.
hypernasality (n.)

mar, dealing with the conceptual or referential properties of language.
hypersemotactics (n.)

hypocoristic (n.)
A term used in linguistics for a pet name (e.g. Harry for
Harold). Hypocoristics and similar phenomena have attracted special attention
232
horizontal grouping/splitting

in some models of non-linear phonology (notably, prosodic morpho-
logy), where they have been used as an illustration of template analysis and
related procedures. One approach on these lines argues that a hypocoristic is the
result of mapping a name onto a minimal word template.
hyponasality (n.)
see nasal
hyponym (n.)
see hyponymy
hyponymy (n.)
A term used in semantics as part of the study of the sense
relations which relate lexical items. Hyponymy is the relationship which obtains
between speciﬁc and general lexical items, such that the former is ‘included’ in
the latter (i.e. ‘is a hyponym of’ the latter). For example, cat is a hyponym of
animal, ﬂute of instrument, chair of furniture, and so on. In each case, there is
a superordinate term (sometimes called a hypernym or hyperonym), with refer-
ence to which the subordinate term can be deﬁned, as is the usual practice in
dictionary deﬁnitions (‘a cat is a type of animal . . .’). The set of terms which are
hyponyms of the same superordinate term are co-hyponyms, e.g. ﬂute, clarinet,
trumpet. A term which is a hyponym of itself, in that the same lexical item can
operate at both superordinate and subordinate levels, is an autohyponym: for
example, cow contrasts with horse, at one level, but at a lower level it contrasts
with bull (in effect, ‘a cow is a kind of cow’). Hyponymy is distinguished from
such other sense relations as synonymy, antonymy and meronymy.
hypophonemic (adj.)
One of the strata recognized in stratiﬁcational gram-
mar, dealing with the phonetic properties of an utterance.
hypophonotactics (n.)
see taxis
hypotactic (adj.)
A term used in traditional grammatical analysis, and
often found in descriptive linguistic studies, to refer to dependent con-
structions, especially those where constituents have been linked through the
use of subordinating conjunctions. ‘Hypotactic constructions’ are opposed
to paratactic ones, where the linkage is conveyed solely by juxtaposition and
punctuation/intonation. Hypotaxis is illustrated by The keeper laughed when
the dog barked (cf. the keeper laughed; the dog barked).

iamb (n.)
A traditional term in metrics for a unit of poetic rhythm comprising
a single pair of unstressed + stressed syllables (as in believe); also called an
iambic foot. In metrical phonology, the notion is used as an informal name
for bounded right-dominant feet, which display this rhythmical structure.
See also trochee.
iambic reversal
see reversal
iconicity (n.) (1)
A suggested deﬁning property of some semiotic systems,
but not language, to refer to signals whose physical form closely corresponds
to characteristics of the situations to which they refer. This is the normal state
of affairs in animal communication, for example, where a call expressing fear
is used only in a fear-producing context. In language, only a small number of
items could be argued to possess such directly symbolic (iconic) properties, e.g.
onomatopoeic expressions such as cuckoo, growl.
(2)
In linguistics, iconicity identiﬁes the extent to which a relationship between
semantic notions is directly represented in a language’s formal expression.
For example, the semantic relation of a verb to its direct object (I see a cat) is
closer than that of a verb to its adverbial (I see a cat every evening), and in so
far as a language would reﬂect this difference in closeness formally (e.g. through
morphology or through word-order) one could talk of an iconic corres-
pondence. This pair of examples would support the notion, in that the normal
word-order is as given, and not *I see every evening a cat). Iconicity is especially
notable in morphology, where increased formal markedness typically corres-
ponds to increased semantic markedness.
idealization (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the degree to which
linguists ignore certain aspects of the variability in their raw data, in order to
arrive at an analysis that is as generally applicable as possible. Idealization is
a major assumption of generative linguistics, as it underlies the notion of
competence. A main aim of linguistics, in this view, is to account for the
language of an ideal (or idealized) speaker-hearer in an ideal (i.e. homogeneous)
speech community, who knows the language perfectly, and is unaffected by
memory limitations, distractions, errors, etc., in actually using the language.
A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics 6th Edition.  David Crystal
© 2008 David Crystal.  ISBN: 978-1-405-15296-9

While some degree of idealization is inevitable, if general statements are to be
made, the decision as to what can be discounted in carrying out an analysis is
often controversial.
ideational (adj.)
A term sometimes used in semantics as part of a classiﬁca-
tion of types of meaning. It refers to that aspect of meaning which relates to the
speaker’s cognitive awareness of the external world or (in a behavioural deﬁni-
tion) to the objectively veriﬁable states of affairs in the external world, as reﬂected
in language. This function of language, for the expression of content, is usually
contrasted with interpersonal (or social), expressive and textual meaning.
Terms with similar meaning include ‘conceptual’, ‘referential’, ‘propositional’
and cognitive. The cognitive process of forming ideas and relationships of
meaning, prior to their formulation in language, is known as ideation.
identity (n.) (ident)
A family of faithfulness constraints in optimality
theory which penalize differences in features between two forms which stand
in a correspondence relation.
identity operation
see zero
ideogram (n.)
In graphology, a term used for a symbol in a writing system
which represents a whole word or concept; also called an ideograph. Ideographic
writing is usually distinguished as a later development from pictographic. Ideo-
grams have an abstract or conventional meaning, no longer displaying a clear
pictorial link with external reality. Examples include a foot shape representing
‘go’ or a sun symbol representing ‘wisdom’. See also convention, pictogram.
ideograph (n.)
see ideogram
ideophone (n.)
A term sometimes used in linguistics and phonetics for any
vivid (ideophonic) representation of an idea in sound, such as occurs through
onomatopoeia. In Bantu linguistics, it is the name of a particular word-class
containing sound-symbolic words, often accompanied by such extralinguistic
(or ‘mimetic’) effects as whistles or clapping.
idioglossia (n.)
A term sometimes used in linguistics for an invented form of
speech whose meaning is known only to the inventor(s); also called autonomous
speech or cryptophasia. An example is the idiosyncratic form of communication
which sometimes emerges spontaneously between twins, and which is popularly
labelled ‘twin language’ (though it is invariably only a deviant form of the local
mother-tongue).
idiolect (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the linguistic system of
an individual speaker – one’s personal dialect. A dialect can be seen as an
abstraction deriving from the analysis of a large number of idiolects. Idiolectal
features are particularly noticeable in literary writing, as stylistic markers
of authorship. Some linguists give the term a more restricted deﬁnition, refer-
ring to the speech habits of a person as displayed in a particular variety at a
given time.
idiolect
235

idiom (n.)
A term used in grammar and lexicology to refer to a sequence
of words which is semantically and often syntactically restricted, so that
they function as a single unit. From a semantic viewpoint, the meanings of the
individual words cannot be summed to produce the meaning of the idiomatic
expression as a whole. From a syntactic viewpoint, the words often do not
permit the usual variability they display in other contexts, e.g. it’s raining cats
and dogs does not permit *it’s raining a cat and a dog/dogs and cats, etc.
Because of their lack of internal contrastivity, some linguists refer to idioms
as ‘ready-made utterances’. An alternative terminology refers to idioms as
‘habitual collocations’. A point which has attracted considerable discussion is
the extent to which degrees and kinds of idiomaticness can be established: some
idioms do permit a degree of internal change, and are somewhat more literal in
meaning than others (e.g. it’s worth her while/the job will be worth my while,
etc.). In generative grammar, idiomatic constructions are used for testing
hypotheses about structure: if idioms are units whose parts stay together in deep
structure, then one can test whether a particular syntactic construction involves
movement by seeing whether the parts of the idiom can be separated in that
construction. In this approach, also, the term idiom chunk is used for one part
of an idiom which has been separated from the remainder through some syntactic
operation, such as the basket in That’s the basket into which I’ve put all my
eggs (cf. I’ve put all my eggs into one basket).
idiophone (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to a speech sound
identiﬁable with reference to a single idiolect.
I-language (n.)
An abbreviation for internalized language, a term suggested by
Noam Chomsky to refer to a language viewed as an element of the mind of
a person who knows the language, acquired by the learner, and used by the
speaker-hearer. It is seen in contrast with E-language.
illative (adj./n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a type of
inﬂection which expresses the meaning of ‘motion into’ or ‘direction towards’
a place. The illative case (‘the illative’) is found in Finnish, for example, along
with allative, elative and several other cases expressing ‘local’ temporal and
spatial meanings.
ill formed (adj.)
A term used in linguistics, especially in generative grammar,
to refer to the ungrammaticality (ill-formedness or deviance) of a sentence.
A sentence is ill formed if it cannot be generated by the rules of a grammar; it
is well formed if it can be. The term applies equally to syntax, semantics
and phonology.
illiteracy (n.)
see literacy
illocutionary (adj.)
A term used in the theory of speech acts to refer to an act
which is performed by the speaker by virtue of the utterance having been
made. Examples of illocutionary acts (or illocutionary force) include promising,
commanding, requesting, baptizing, arresting, etc. The term is contrasted with
locutionary (the act of ‘saying’) and perlocutionary (where the act is deﬁned
by reference to the effect it has on the hearer).
236

image schema
A type of basic conceptual structure identiﬁed in cognitive
semantics. Schemas such as Path and Container are held to be prelinguistic
structures based on bodily experience and which help to shape the form of
linguistic categories. They are used to describe, for example, the semantics of
spatial, temporal and aspectual expressions. See also schema.
imitation (n.)
An application of the general sense of this term to language
acquisition, where it refers to children’s behaviour in copying the language
they hear around them. The importance of the notion is twofold. First, it has
been shown that imitation cannot by itself account for the facts of language
development (despite a popular view to the contrary – that children learn
language by imitating their parents): forms such as *mouses and *wented, and
sentences such as *Me not like that, show that some internal process of con-
struction is taking place. Second, the skills children show when they are actually
imitating are often different, in important aspects, from those they display
in spontaneous speech production, or in comprehension. The relationship
between imitation, production and comprehension has been a major focus of
experimental and descriptive interest in acquisition studies.
immediate constituent (IC)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to
the major divisions that can be made within a syntactic construction, at any
level. For example, in analysing the sentence The boy is walking, the immedi-
ate constituents would be the boy and is walking. These in turn can be analysed
into immediate constituents (the + boy, is + walking), and the process continues
until irreducible constituents are reached. The whole procedure is known as
immediate-constituent analysis (or ‘constituent analysis’), and was a major
feature of Bloomﬁeldian structuralist linguistics.
immediate dominance (1)
A term used in generative linguistics for a type
of relationship between nodes in a phrase-marker: a node A immediately
dominates a node B if and only if (a) A dominates B, and (b) there is no node
C such that it also dominates B and is dominated by A.
(2)
An immediate dominance (ID) rule is a type of rule in generalized phrase-
structure grammar of the form X ⇒ Y, Z. It speciﬁes that X can dominate Y
and Z but does not specify the relative order of Y and Z. Together with linear
precedence rules and various general principles, ID rules generate phrase-
markers of the classical type.
imperative (adj./n.) (imp, imper, IMPER)
A term used in the grammatical
classiﬁcation of sentence types, and usually seen in contrast to indicative,
interrogative, etc. An imperative usage (‘an imperative’) refers to verb forms
or sentence/clause types typically used in the expression of commands, e.g.
Go away!
imperfective (adj./n.)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of aspect,
referring to those forms of the verb which mark the way in which the internal
time structure of a situation is viewed. Imperfective forms (or ‘imperfectives’)
contrast with perfective forms, where the situation is seen as a whole, regardless
of the time contrasts it may contain. The contrast is well recognized in the
grammar of Slavic languages.
imperfective
237

imperfect tense (imp, imperf, impf, IMPF)
In grammar, a tense form used in
some languages to express such meanings as duration or continuity in past time.
Latin is an example of a language which had an imperfect tense: amabam ‘I was
loving/used to love’.
impersonal (adj.)
see person
implicational scaling
A model of language variation which aims to account
for the differential spread of changes in a population. Individual variation
is represented as an alternation between old and new rules, and differences
between individuals are viewed as differences in rule inventories. An implicational
table is used to display the spread of rules throughout a population. The approach
contrasts with the variable rule model, in which variability is a property of the
rules themselves.
implicational universal
see universal
implicature (n.)
A term derived from the work of the philosopher H. P. Grice
(1913–88) and now frequently used in linguistics as part of the study of
conversational structure. Conversational implicatures refer to the implications
which can be deduced from the form of an utterance, on the basis of certain
co-operative principles which govern the efﬁciency and normal acceptability
of conversations, as when the sentence There’s some chalk on the ﬂoor is taken
to mean ‘you ought to pick it up’; they contrast with explicatures, which are
the propositions that are explictly communicated (the fact that the chalk is on
the ﬂoor, in this example). Several types of implicature have been discussed,
in the context of the relationship between language and logical expression, and
of the conditions which affect the appropriateness of utterances. In particular,
implicatures have been classiﬁed into generalized and particularized types – the
former not being restricted to a particular context; the latter requiring a speciﬁc
context. Also, a contrast has been drawn between conversational (or non-
conventional) implicatures, which are inferences calculated on the basis of the
maxims of conversation, and conventional implicatures, which are not derived
from these principles but simply attached by convention to particular expressions.
Examples of the latter which have been suggested include utterance-initial
oh, the use of therefore, even and yet, and sequences of the type He is an
Englishman; therefore he is brave. However, relatively little detailed linguistic
investigation has yet taken place into these matters, and several of the proposals
are controversial.
implicit argument
see argument
implosive (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant
sounds on the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to the series of
plosive sounds it is possible to make using an airstream mechanism invol-
ving an inwards movement of air in the mouth (an ingressive airstream). A
complete closure is made in the mouth, as with any plosive sound, but the air
behind the closure is not compressed, ready for outwards release; instead, a
downwards movement of the larynx takes place, and the air inside the mouth
238
imperfect tense

is accordingly rareﬁed. Upon release of the closure, air is then sucked into the
mouth at the same time as the glottis is released, allowing lung air to produce
some vocal fold vibration. It is this combination of movements that results
in the characteristically ‘hollow’ auditory effect of the implosive consonants (or
‘implosives’). Such consonants are usually voiced and occur phonemically
in such languages as Sindi and Ibo. They are transcribed with a right-facing
hook attached to the consonant symbol, as in [‘], [—], [œ]. Alternative terms are
‘ingressive stop’ and ‘suction stop’ consonants. There is no opposite technical
term ‘explosive’.
impressionistic transcription
see transcription
inalienable (adj.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to a type of
possessive relationship formally marked in some languages (e.g. Chinese). If a
possessed item is seen as being in a permanent or necessary relationship to its
possessor, the relationship is said to be inalienable (e.g. the dog’s head, the town
centre), otherwise it is alienable.
inanimate (adj.)
see animate
inceptive (adj./n.) (incep, INCEP)
A term used in the grammatical analysis
of verbs, to refer to a type of aspectual relationship in which the beginning of
an action is speciﬁed; also called inchoative (inch, INCH). In languages which
mark an inceptive aspect (an ‘inceptive’), the meaning might be translated into
English by ‘be about to’ or ‘be on the point of’ – for example, Latin -escere. A
contrast is sometimes drawn with telic verbs.
inchoative /}nckvävt}v/ (adj./n.)
see inceptive
included (adj.)
see inclusion (1), (2)
inclusion (n.) (1)
A semantic relationship which identiﬁes the sense relation
of hyponymy; e.g. to say that a car is a kind of vehicle is to say that the class
of cars is included within that of vehicles.
(2)
In grammatical analysis, included is mainly used to refer to a linguistic
form which occurs as a constituent of a construction: it is in the ‘included
position’. For example, the clause parked in the street is in the included posi-
tion in the sentence The car parked in the street was a Ford.
(3)
With reference to pronouns, inclusive (incl) is used (in contrast with
exclusive) to refer to a ﬁrst-person role where the speaker and addressee are
both included, e.g. we = ‘me and you’ or ‘me and others and you’.
(4)
In semantics, a term derived from formal logic (in contrast with exclusive)
to refer to a type of disjunction: in an inclusive interpretation, the disjunction
is true if either, or both, of the propositions is true. In Either X is happening or
Y is happening, an inclusive interpretation allows (‘includes’) both options.
(5)
In sociolinguistics, and increasingly in general usage, inclusive language
refers to the use of words which avoid the social stereotypes associated with
particular social groups, especially in relation to ethnicity and sex. For example,
because a noun such as spokesman, though traditionally generic, could be
inclusion
239

given an excluding interpretation (i.e. referring to males only), it would be
replaced in an inclusive approach by such nouns as spokesperson. In relation to
the avoidance of sexual stereotypes, the term non-sexist language is often used.

inclusiveness condition
A constraint in the minimalist programme which
bars the introduction of new elements into the derivation beyond what is
already available in numeration. This constraint is the basis for bare phrase
structure. See phrase-structure grammar.
incompatibility (n.)
A term used in semantics as part of the study of the
sense relations between lexical items. It refers to sets of items where the
choice of one item excludes the use of all the other items from that set (unless
there is to be a contradiction). Colour terms provide a well-studied example: to
say the car is red excludes the car is green/blue, etc. – and the set of items which
contrast in this way are said to be incompatible. Incompatibility has been less
investigated than other sense relations (such as antonymy and synonymy), but
some linguists have pointed to the existence of different types of many-member
(as opposed to binary) sets, such as ranks (e.g. military), scales (e.g. value
judgements) and cycles (e.g. seasons).
incomplete assimilation
see assimilation
incorporating (adj.)
A term which characterizes a type of language some-
times distinguished in comparative linguistics using structural (as opposed
to diachronic) criteria, and focusing on the characteristics of the word:
‘polysynthetic’ or incorporating languages demonstrate morphologically
complex, long word forms, as in the constructions typical of many American
Indian languages, and encountered occasionally in English, in coinages such as
anti/dis/establish/ment/arian/ism/s. Some linguists, however, prefer to see such
constructions handled as a complex of incorporated agglutinative and fusional
characteristics, and do not regard this category of language as typologically
distinct. As always in such classiﬁcations, the categories are not clear-cut: dif-
ferent languages will display the characteristic of incorporation to a greater or
lesser degree.
incorporation (n.) (inc)
In the study of word-formation, a general term for
any kind of morphological element found within a word (especially, within
a verb). pronouns and particles are among the elements which may be
incorporated, but the term is speciﬁcally used for noun incorporation, where a
noun stem is used within a verb to form a complex verb. The process carries
a variety of functions, such as narrowing the semantic range of the verb, or
varying the information structure of the sentence. Incorporation has been
much discussed in linguistic theory because of its unclear status in relation to the
lexicon (where it can be handled as a process of derivation) or the syntax
(where it can be handled as a result of movement transformations).

indeﬁnite (adj.) (indef)
A term used in grammar and semantics to refer to an
entity (or class of entities) which is not capable of speciﬁc identiﬁcation; it is
contrasted with deﬁnite. Indeﬁniteness in English is usually conveyed through
the use of the indeﬁnite article, a, or an indeﬁnite pronoun (such as one,
some, etc.). Non-deﬁnite is often used as a synonym, but some linguists make a
difference between ‘non-deﬁnite’ and ‘indeﬁnite’ reference. However, the distinc-
tion between deﬁnite and indeﬁnite is not a straightforward one, given the many
linguistic and extralinguistic contextual variables which operate. See also
speciﬁc indeﬁnite.

indeterminacy (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a state of affairs
in linguistic study in which there is uncertainty on the part of a native-speaker,
or disagreement between native-speakers, as to what is grammatical or accept-
able; or in which there is uncertainty on the part of a linguist, or between
several linguists, as to how and where a boundary line between different types
of structure might best be drawn. Indeterminacy poses a major difﬁculty
for linguistic theories which attempt to deﬁne the limits of grammaticality in
an unequivocal way (as in generative grammar). It is a major focus of atten-
tion in non-discrete or fuzzy grammar, and several analytical notions
have been proposed to handle indeterminate phenomena (e.g. gradience,
squish).
index (n.)
see afﬁx, indexical, indexing, referential indices, structural
description
indexical (adj.) (1)
A term used by some linguists to refer to features of
speech or writing which reveal the personal (biological, psychological or social)
characteristics of a language user, as in voice quality or handwriting. More
generally, the term may be used to refer to the membership-identifying charac-
teristics of a group, such as regional, social or occupational indices.
(2)
The philosophical use of this term (either alone, or in the phrase indexical
expression) is sometimes encountered in linguistics to refer to those features
of language which refer directly to characteristics of the situation within
which an utterance takes place; their meaning is thus relative to that situation.
Linguists more regularly refer to these features as deictic features. Pure index-
ical is sometimes used for those indexical expressions whose reference is
ﬁxed automatically by the time, place, etc. of utterance, such as yesterday; it
contrasts with demonstrative.
indexing (n.)
An application of the general use of this term in generative
linguistics to refer to the numerical or literal markers attached to a set of
items in a sentence, to show identity or difference of reference. The indices
are known more explicitly as referential indices. In later work, indexing rules
assign numerical or literal indices to noun phrases in a sentence to ensure that
the correct semantic relations of co-reference are represented – a process which
indexing
241

has come to be known as co-indexing. The conditions which restrict the
application of indexing rules are known as binding conditions.
indicative (adj.) (indic, INDIC)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁca-
tion of sentence types, and usually seen in contrast to imperative, subjunct-
ive, etc., moods. It refers to verb forms or sentence/clause types used in
the expression of statements and questions, e.g. the horse is walking. With
reference to statements, the term ‘declarative’ may be used.
indicator (n.)
In sociolinguistics, a term which refers to a linguistic variable
which conveys little or no social import, people being largely unaware of the
distinction or its distribution within the speech community. An example is the
contrast some speakers make between the vowels in cot and caught in US English.
William Labov (b. 1927) distinguishes indicators from markers and stereotypes.
indices (n.)
see indexical (1), indexing, referential indices
indirect (adj.) (1)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to one
of the two types of object element which can function in clause structure,
the other being labelled direct; traditionally considered a dative function.
Indirect objects (IO) in English usually appear before the direct object (e.g. the
woman gave the boy a book), but may also follow it (e.g. the woman gave a
book to the boy). This traditional use of the term applies to the ‘recipient’ noun
phrase in ditransitive constructions regardless of its position. By contrast,
generative grammar (especially relational grammar), uses the term in a
more restricted way, only for the complement of the preposition (usually to),
as in The woman gave a book to the boy. In relational grammar, the indirect
object can be promoted and become a direct object, while the original direct
object becomes a chômeur.
(2)
A term used in some approaches to grammar for a question which
functions as a subordinate clause; in generative linguistics often called an
embedded question. Examples include She knows [where Mary is going] and
I know [what I want].
(3)
The opposition between direct and indirect is also used to identify the two
main ways of reﬂecting a person’s speech: indirect speech (or ‘reported speech’)
refers to the use of a grammatical construction where the words of the
speaker are subordinated to a verb in a main clause, e.g. she said that she
had a cold, where the ‘direct speech’ would have been I have a cold.
(4)
In the classiﬁcation of speech acts, indirect refers to an utterance
whose linguistic form does not directly reﬂect its communicative purpose, as
when I’m feeling cold functions as a request for someone to close a door. If,
on the other hand, someone produced the same sentence to express, literally, the
fact that he or she was feeling cold, then the speech act would be ‘direct’ – an
assertion.
individual concept
A term used in possible-worlds semantics referring to
a function which maps possible worlds (or world–time pairs) onto indi-
viduals. Such functions serve as the intensions of proper names and similar
expressions.
242
indicative

individual level
In semantic theory, a term used for predicates representing
typically long-lived properties which produce generic readings when combined
with bare plural noun phrases. For example, in the sentence Dogs like meat,
the predicate expresses a permanent property of dogs, whereas in Dogs are
barking outside the predicate expresses a temporary property (a stage-l level
predicate).
ineffability (n.)
In optimality theory, a term describing the situation which
arises when the application of a set of constraints to a particular input yields
no acceptable output. The adjectival use is ineffable.
inessive (adj./n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a type
of inﬂection which expresses the meaning of location or position within a
place. The inessive case (‘the inessive’) is found in Finnish, for example, along
with adessive, allative and several other cases expressing ‘local’ temporal and
spatial meanings.
infelicitous utterances
see felicity conditions
inﬁnitival (adj./n.)
see inﬁnitive
inﬁnitive (n.) (inf, INF)
A traditional term for the non-ﬁnite form of the
verb usually cited as its unmarked or base form, e.g. go, walk, kick, though
some languages mark it syntactically or morphologically. In English,
the inﬁnitive form may be used alone or in conjunction with the particle
to (the to-inﬁnitive), e.g. he saw her go v. he wants to go. The form without to
is sometimes known as the bare or zero inﬁnitive. Inserting an adverb or
other element between the to and the verb results in the split inﬁnitive. In
government-binding theory, the term inﬁnitive (or inﬁnitival) clause is used
for constructions with to-inﬁnitive.
inﬁx (n.)
A term used in morphology referring to an afﬁx which is added
within a root or stem. The process of inﬁxation (or inﬁxing) is not encoun-
tered in European languages, but it is commonly found in Asian, American
Indian and African languages (e.g. Arabic).
INFL /c}nfvl/

inﬂected/inﬂecting language

inﬂection/inﬂexion (n.) (1)
A term used in morphology to refer to one of the
two main categories or processes of word-formation (inﬂectional morpho-
logy), the other being derivation(al). These terms also apply to the two types
of afﬁx involved in word-formation. Inﬂectional afﬁxes signal grammatical
relationships, such as plural, past tense and possession, and do not change the
grammatical class of the stems to which they are attached; that is, the words
constitute a single paradigm, e.g. walk, walks, walked. A word is said to inﬂect
for past tense, plural, etc. In traditional (prelinguistic) grammatical studies, the
term ‘accidence’ was used in this sense, as was the term ﬂexion.
inﬂection/inﬂexion
243

(2) (INFL, I)
A term used in government-binding theory (at ﬁrst symbolized
as INFL, later as I) for an abstract constituent which subsumes various gram-
matical properties – in particular, tense, person and number (the latter two
being separately grouped as agreement features, or AGR). In X-bar theory, I is
like the lexical categories N, V, A and P in that it is a zero-level category with
two phrasal projections, I′ and I″. I″, the maximal projection of I, is usually
referred to as inﬂection phrase (IP). It is equivalent to S in earlier GB and certain
other theories.
(3)
In the phrase inﬂecting language (inﬂectional or inﬂected languages), the
term characterizes a type of language established by comparative linguistics
using structural (as opposed to diachronic) criteria, and focusing on the
characteristics of the word. In this kind of language, words display grammatical
relationships morphologically: they typically contain more than one morpheme
but, unlike agglutinative languages, there is no one-to-one correspondence
between these morphemes and the linear sequence of morphs. In languages
such as Latin, Greek and Arabic, the inﬂectional forms of words may repres-
ent several morphological oppositions, e.g. in Latin amo (‘I love’), the form
simultaneously represents tense, active, ﬁrst person singular, indicative. This
‘fusing’ of properties has led to such languages being called fusional, and has
motivated the word-and-paradigm model of analysis. As always in such
classiﬁcations, the categories are not clear-cut: different languages will display
the characteristic of inﬂection to a greater or lesser degree.

informality (n.)
see formality
informant (n.)
Someone who acts as a source of data for linguistic analysis,
usually a native-speaker of a language. Linguists may act in this way, but
more usually an attempt is made to construct or verify hypotheses by referring
directly to a range of informants, who provide, it is hoped, a representative
sample of the language one is investigating. In ﬁeldwork on previously unstudied
languages, the informant is of fundamental importance, and several sophis-
ticated techniques for eliciting relevant but natural data from informants have
now been devised. Informants’ judgements about the acceptability of sentences
are known as intuitions (especially in generative grammar). Since the early
1980s, some linguists have preferred to use the term consultant, reﬂecting the
collaborative nature of the work.
information (n.)
linguistics has made several uses of this fundamental con-
cept, both in a general sense, and also as formalized in statistical terms, derived
from the mathematical theory of communication. Ideas derived from informa-
tion theory (as formulated originally by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver in
their book The Mathematical Theory of Communication (1949)) have been
applied in phonetics (e.g. in analysing the amount of information carried by
the various features of the sound wave), grammar (e.g. in studies of the predict-
ability of various parts of a sentence) and semantics (e.g. in applying the
244
inﬂectional language

notion of ‘choice’ between alternatives in the analysis of semantic contrasts, as
in dynamic semantics). The concept of redundancy, for example, ultimately
derives from this approach.
In its general sense, the term is used by several linguists as a basis for a theoret-
ical account of the structure of messages. It is postulated that speech can be
seen as displaying an information structure, encoding the relative salience of the
elements in a message, with formally identiﬁable units of information. intona-
tion provides the main signal for such units. The tone unit represents an
information unit, and the nuclear tone marks the information focus. Many
sentences will be single units of information, e.g. the box on the table is ready
for pòsting/, but altering the intonation, in this view, alters the number of
information units, e.g. the box on the táble/ is ready for pòsting/. Even if one
tone unit is retained, altering the tonicity will change the information struc-
ture, e.g. the bòx on the table is ready for posting/ (i.e. not the envelope). The
further analysis of information structure is complex and controversial: a com-
mon next step is to distinguish between given and new information. Analysts
who use this approach (e.g. hallidayan linguists) usually distinguish between
information structure and thematic and grammatical structure.
-ing form
A term used in English grammatical description to refer to
the form of the verb ending in -ing, e.g. going, smoking. Many such forms
can be used without change as nouns (e.g. smoking is prohibited), and the
purpose of the term is to provide a neutral descriptive label for this feature of
English, thus avoiding the use of such traditional notions as ‘gerund’, which
were originally devised for Latin grammar. In classical transformational
grammar, -ing noun forms were transformationally derived from the related
verb forms.
ingressive (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds,
referring to all sounds produced using an inwards-moving airstream mech-
anism. The opposite category is egressive, which is the normal mode for speech
production. Ingressive sounds (‘ingressives’) are often heard incidentally, as when
one speaks while breathing in, when out of breath, or vocalizes upon a sudden
intake of breath when expressing pain or surprise. Two types of ingressive
sound are used as part of the phonemic systems of some languages: implos-
ive consonants such as [‘], [— ], [œ], made by an inward ﬂow of air in con-
junction with glottal vibration; and velaric consonants, which constitute such
click sounds as [|] (as in ‘tut tut’), made by an inward ﬂow of air in conjunction
with contact made at the velum.
inherent Case
see case (2)
inherent features
A term used in some models of generative grammar (see
aspects model) to refer to one of the types of (binary) features which are
contained in a lexical entry (the others being contextual and rule features)
Inherent features provide information about the essential characteristics of an
item likely to affect its syntactic functioning, e.g. [+human], [+abstract], [+male].
They are involved at several points in an analysis, e.g. in specifying selectional
restrictions and in some non-lexical transformations.
inherent features
245

inheritance (n.)
A term used in several domains of linguistics to refer to the
passing on of information from one part of a structural representation to
another. For example, in semantics, the relationship between subtype and type
(e.g. ﬁsh and food) can be characterized as the subtype inheriting all the proper-
ties of its supertypes. In generative grammar, inheritance refers to the preser-
vation of argument structure under certain conditions (e.g. a nominalization
of a verb, such as running, preserves the arguments of the input verb). In some
models of non-linear phonology, information can be inherited between
certain types of unit in a prosodic hierarchy. An inheritance hierarchy is
also recognized in some approaches to syntax, referring to the organization of
elements of a domain in a system of natural classes.
inheritance principle
see binding
initial (adj.)
The usual way of referring to the ﬁrst element in a linguistic
unit, especially in phonology. For example, the phoneme /k/ occurs ‘in initial
position’ (or ‘initially’) in the word cat; the word the occurs in initial position in
the phrase the big house. Other positions are referred to as medial and ﬁnal.
Other linguistic features which occur in this position are sometimes labelled
accordingly, e.g. ‘initial stress’ (i.e. stress on the ﬁrst syllable in a word).
initialism (n.)
see abbreviation
initial state
see ﬁnal state
initial symbol
The ﬁrst, undeﬁned term in a generative grammar, employed
in early phrase-structure grammars, which appears on the left-hand side of
the ﬁrst rewrite rule. Standing for sentence, the highest-level construction
recognized by the grammar, it has been symbolized as Σ, S′ or CP. The contrast
implied is with terminal symbols, the items which occur in a terminal string
generated by the grammar. Other starting-points than sentence have occasion-
ally been suggested.
initiator (n.)
A term in phonetics for a vocal organ which is the source of air
movement. The lungs are the normal initiators for speech, but other airstream
mechanisms can be used. Initiation, from an aerodynamic point of view, is
comparable to a bellows or piston.
innateness (n.)
An application of the philosophical use of this term in
psycholinguistics, referring to the view that the child is born with a biological
predisposition to learn language. The innateness hypothesis (or nativist
hypothesis) argues that the rapid and complex development of children’s
grammatical competence can be explained only by the hypothesis that they
are born with an innate knowledge of at least some of the universal struc-
tural principles of human language. This view (nativism) has received con-
siderable support in generative linguistics (see language acquisition device),
but controversy abounds over the nature of the early linguistic knowledge
which might be attributable to the child, and whether this knowledge can be
speciﬁed independently of other (e.g. cognitive) factors. The approach contrasts
246
inheritance

with those that view language in purely behavioural terms. See behaviourism,
empiricism.
input (n.) (1)
A term used in psycholinguistics to refer to the external lin-
guistic data available to speakers in the course of acquiring a language. The
notion is particularly relevant to child language acquisition of a mother-tongue,
where the role of input is related to other factors in learning, such as innate
ability (see innateness); but it also applies in the study of foreign-language
learning. The term is also used in language processing to refer to the signal
processed by the listener/reader.
(2)
A use of the general sense of this term is found in generative grammar for
a linguistic construct which triggers the application of a rule, either as the
starting-point in the generation of a sentence or at a later stage in a derivation.
It contrasts with output, which may be a derived linguistic construct or (after
all rules have been applied) a representation of what people actually say. In
this approach, the input to a rule is typically the output of an earlier rule.
(3)
In optimality theory, an input is a linguistic construct, composed from the
elements in universal grammar (consonant, vowel, syllable, noun, verb, etc.),
to which output representations are related. This process takes place through
the operation of the generator and evaluator mechanisms provided by the
theory. The optimal input is selected from all possible inputs (corresponding to
a single output) as the one which incurs the fewest highest-ranked constraint
violations. The OT perspective therefore runs contrary to the traditional
generative approach, for it does not require a unique input for a given output.
Any input which results in a correct input–output pairing is a viable input.
insertion (n.)
A basic syntactic operation within the framework of trans-
formational grammar which introduces (inserts) a new structural element
into a string; speciﬁc types of example include ‘do-insertion’, ‘negative
(neg-)insertion’, ‘there-insertion’ (which inserts an empty there in subject posi-
tion in statements, e.g. there was a cat in the garden) and ‘lexical insertion’
(which inserts lexical items at particular places in grammatical structure).
in situ /}n cs}tàup/
A term used in government-binding theory to describe
a constituent that stays in its place. For example, wh-in situ refers to a
wh-element which cannot be moved because another such element occupies its
landing site (see movement). In I asked who had driven what, what cannot
move because of the presence of who. From this point of view, languages such
as Chinese or Japanese are called wh-in situ languages, since they do not require
fronting wh-phrases.
instantaneous (adj.)
A term sometimes used in the distinctive feature
theory of phonology, as part of the phrase instantaneous release, referring to a
sound released suddenly, without the acoustic turbulence of a fricative, as in
plosive consonants. Its opposite is delayed release, used to characterize
affricates.
institutional linguistics
A developing branch of linguistics in which the focus
is on the language used in professional contexts, such as law, medicine, education
institutional linguistics
247

and business. As other domains of linguistic enquiry (e.g. sociolinguistics,
stylistics) also study such contexts, the term is not in widespread use.
instrumental (adj./n.) (inst, INST)
In languages which express grammatical
relationships by means of inﬂections, this term refers to the form taken by a
noun phrase (often a single noun or pronoun), when it expresses such a
notion as ‘by means of’ (as in Russian). The term has a special status in case
grammar, where it refers to the semantic case of the inanimate entity causally
involved in a verb’s action (e.g. the key in the key opened the door or the door
was opened with a key), and is contrasted with agentive, dative, etc. The
instrumental case (‘the instrumental’) is also used in some predicative construc-
tions in Russian, such as with the future and past of ‘to be’, e.g. On budet
studentom ‘He will be a student’. See semantic role.
instrumental phonetics
see phonetics
intensiﬁer (n.)
A term used in some grammatical classiﬁcations of words to
refer to a class of adverbs which have a heightening or lowering effect on the
meaning of another element in the sentence. Intensifying adverbs include
very, terribly, deﬁnitely, hardly, and kind of.
intension (n.) (1)
A term used in philosophy and logic, and now often used as
part of a theoretical framework for linguistic semantics, to refer to the set of
deﬁning properties which determines the applicability of a term. For example,
‘legs’, ‘ﬂat surface’, etc., deﬁne the intension of table, and an intensional deﬁni-
tion would be based on such notions, e.g. ‘A table is something with legs, a ﬂat
surface, etc.’ It is opposed to extension.
(2)
Intension is also used in semantics to refer to the sense of an expression,
especially when modelled as a function from indices to extensions, as in
possible-worlds semantics. For ‘intensional contexts’, see opaque (3).
intensity (n.)
see loudness
intensive (adj.)
A term used in some grammatical analyses to refer to struc-
tures where there is a close semantic identity between elements of structure,
such as between subject and complement (e.g. she is a dentist), between
object and complement (e.g. they called him Fred) or in apposition (e.g. John
the butcher . . . ). The verbs involved in intensive constructions are called intens-
ive verbs or ‘linking verbs’. In government-binding theory some of these
constructions are analysed as small clauses. The term is opposed to extensive.
interaction (n.)
An application of the general use of this term in sociolinguis-
tics, to refer to the study of speech in face-to-face communication (interactional
sociolinguistics). The approach deals chieﬂy with the norms and strategies of
everyday conversation, and is characterized by detailed transcriptions of taped
interactions, with particular reference to features which have been traditionally
neglected in the analysis of conversation, such as prosody, facial expression,
silence, and rhythmical patterns of behaviour between the participants. In
contrast to other kinds of conversation analysis, particular attention is paid
248
instrumental

to the social factors which help to shape the interaction, such as the desire by
the participants to maintain politeness (see face) or to recognize mutual rights
and obligations.
interchangeability (n.)
A suggested deﬁning property of a semiotic system,
including human language, to refer to the system’s ability to be mutually
transmitted and received by members of the same species. Some animal signals,
by contrast, lack this property – for example, female calls which are not shared
by the male members of the species.
interclausal grammar
see role and reference grammar
interdental (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant
sounds, referring to a sound made by the tip of the tongue between the teeth.
Interdental sounds (‘interdentals’) are heard in the received pronunciation of
English th /θ/ and /¨/.
interface (n.)
In the minimalist programme, a term describing the status
of the two levels of representation recognized in the approach: logical
form (LF) and phonetic form (PF). Their role is to connect linguistic repres-
entations to interpretation elsewhere: LF interfaces with the conceptual systems
of cognition, and PF interfaces with articulatory and perceptual systems of
speech production/perception.
interference (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics and foreign-language learn-
ing to refer to the errors a speaker introduces into one language as a result of
contact with another language; also called negative transfer (see contrastive
(2)). The most common source of error is in the process of learning a foreign
language, where the native tongue interferes; but interference may occur in other
contact situations (as in multilingualism).
interjection (n.)
A term used in the traditional classiﬁcation of parts of
speech, referring to a class of words which are unproductive, do not enter
into syntactic relationships with other classes, and whose function is purely
emotive, e.g. Yuk!, Strewth!, Blast!, Tut tut! There is an unclear boundary
between these items and other types of exclamation, where some referential
meaning may be involved, and where there may be more than one word, e.g.
Excellent!, Lucky devil!, Cheers!, Well well! Several alternative ways of analys-
ing these items have been suggested, using such notions as minor sentence,
formulaic language, etc.
interlanguage (n.)
The linguistic system created by someone in the course of
learning a foreign language, different from either the speaker’s ﬁrst language
or the target language being acquired. It reﬂects the learner’s evolving system of
rules, and results from a variety of processes, including the inﬂuence of the ﬁrst
language (‘transfer’), contrastive interference from the target language, and
the overgeneralization of newly encountered rules.
inter-level (n.)
A term used in Hallidayan linguistics referring to a level
of analysis lying in between the main levels recognized by the theory. In this
inter-level
249

view, phonology would be seen as an inter-level relating phonic/graphic
substance and linguistic form. See also harmonic phonology.
interlingua (n.) (1)
A term used in machine translation for a proposed inter-
mediate representation constructed to facilitate the automatic translation of
one language into another. In an interlingual approach, the source language
is given a highly abstract representation which captures all the syntactic and
semantic information necessary for translation into several target languages.
The interlingua would usually be a specially constructed formal language,
but other artiﬁcial languages have been proposed (such as Esperanto), and
in theory a natural language could also be used. The difﬁculty of developing a
model of syntactic or semantic universals has limited the applicability of this
approach.
(2)
See lingua franca.
intermediate (adj.) (1)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of vowel
qualities, to refer to a vowel which falls between two adjacent cardinal
vowels. The vowel which occurs in the centre of the cardinal vowel area (see
schwa) is also sometimes referred to as an intermediate vowel.
(2)
In X-bar theory, a ‘small’ phrase – larger than the lexical category (zero-
level projection) and smaller than the maximal projection (usually X-double-bar,
or XP) – is called an intermediate projection (X-single-bar, or X′).
internal adequacy
see adequacy
internal argument
see argument
internal evidence
In historical linguistics and philology, a term summar-
izing the linguistic features in a text which indicate when or where the work
was written, or who the author was. Handwriting, idiosyncratic spellings and
other features of graphic substance play an important role, as do favourite
patterns of vocabulary and grammar. A contrast is intended with external
evidence, such as might come from historical records or archaeological ﬁndings. In
generative phonology, a distinction is sometimes made between corpus-internal
and corpus-external evidence to justify an analysis, the latter referring to speaker
judgements of rhymes, spoonerisms, and other ludic linguistic behaviour.
internalize (v.)
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to the process
whereby speakers come to possess knowledge of the structure of their lan-
guage. The term is primarily used in the context of language acquisition,
where children are said to ‘internalize’ rules, as when the use of such forms
as *mans and *mices shows that a plural formation rule has been acquired.
competence, on this account, can be seen as a system of internalized rules.

International Phonetic Association (IPA)
An organization founded in 1886
by a group of European phoneticians (Paul Passy (1859–1940) and others) to
promote the study of phonetics. In 1889 it published the International
Phonetic Alphabet (also IPA) which, in modiﬁed and expanded form, is today
the most widely used system for transcribing the sounds of a language (see
transcription). See p. xxv of this dictionary.
interpersonal (adj.)
A term sometimes used in semantics as part of a classiﬁca-
tion of types of meaning. It refers to those aspects of meaning which relate to
the establishing and maintaining of social relations, e.g. social roles, stylistic
level, the expression of personality. Some scholars also subsume expressive
meaning under this heading. An alternative view sees the linguistic expression
of social relationships as being a matter of sociolinguistic or pragmatic
function, and not semantics.
interpretation (n.)
see translatology
interpretation function
In model-theoretic semantics, a term referring to a
function which maps expressions onto their semantic values. In particular,
it forms one of the basic components of a model, mapping each non-logical
constant basic expression onto its semantic value.
interpretive/interpretative (adj.)
A term used in generative linguistics to
refer to a mode of relationship between levels of representation. Its original
use can be deﬁned with reference to the standard theory of generative gram-
mar. Here, the semantic rules which relate syntactic deep structure to the
semantic component, and the phonological rules which relate syntactic sur-
face structures to the phonological component, are both interpretive, i.e. they
interpret the output of the syntactic structures by assigning them a (semantic
or phonetic) representation, which is the basis from which the meaning and
pronunciation of the sentence is derived. In the interpretive semantics view,
associated with Noam Chomsky and others, it is thus the level of syntax which
contains all the generative power of the grammar. In the early 1970s, the term
came to characterize any model of this general sort, as opposed to those which
claimed that it was the syntax, and not the semantics, which was interpretive –
the view of generative semantics.
interrogative (adj./n.) (inter, interrog)
A term used in the grammatical classi-
ﬁcation of sentence types, and usually seen in contrast to declarative. It refers
to verb forms or sentence/clause types typically used in the expression of
questions, e.g. the inverted order of is he coming?, or the use of an interrogative
word (or simply ‘interrogative’), often subclassiﬁed as interrogative adjectives
(e.g. which), adverbs (e.g. why) and pronouns (e.g. who). See also wh-.

interruptibility (n.)
A term used in grammar to refer to a deﬁning property of
the word, seen as a grammatical unit, where it appears in the form uninter-
ruptibility. A more positive name for this criterion is cohesiveness.
interrupted (adj.)
A term sometimes used in the distinctive feature theory
of phonology to refer to sounds produced with a complete closure of the
vocal tract, as in plosives. Its opposite is continuant, used to characterize
fricatives, vowels, etc.
intervocalic (adj.)
A term used in phonetics to refer to a consonant sound
used between two vowels, as in the /t/ of attack. The phonetic characteristics of
consonants in this position are often different from those in other positions, e.g.
the amount of voicing in a voiced consonant is likely to be greater.
intonation (n.)
A term used in the study of suprasegmental phonology,
referring to the distinctive use of patterns of pitch, or melody. The study of
intonation is sometimes called intonology. Several ways of analysing intonation
have been suggested: in some approaches, the pitch patterns are described as
contours and analysed in terms of levels of pitch as pitch phonemes and
morphemes; in others, the patterns are described as tone units or tone groups,
analysed further as contrasts of nuclear tone, tonicity, etc. The three variables
of pitch range, height and direction are generally distinguished. Some approaches,
especially within pragmatics, operate with a much broader notion than that of
the tone unit: intonational phrasing is a structured hierarchy of the intonational
constituents in conversation. A formal category of intonational phrase is also
sometimes recognized: an utterance span dominated by boundary tones.
Intonation performs several functions in language. Its most important function
is as a signal of grammatical structure, where it performs a role similar to
punctuation in writing, but involving far more contrasts. The marking of sen-
tence, clause and other boundaries, and the contrast between some grammat-
ical structures, such as questions and statements, may be made using intonation.
For example, the change in meaning illustrated by ‘Are you asking me or telling
me’ is regularly signalled by a contrast between rising and falling pitch, e.g.
He’s going, isn’t he? (= I’m asking you) opposed to He’s going, isn’t he! (= I’m
telling you). A second role of intonation is in the communication of personal
attitude: sarcasm, puzzlement, anger, etc., can all be signalled by contrasts in
pitch, along with other prosodic and paralinguistic features. Other roles of
intonation in language have been suggested, e.g. as one of the ways of signalling
social background.
Intonation patterns can be seen as a sequence of pitch levels, or ‘tones’, but
this use of ‘tone’ has to be distinguished from that encountered in the phrase
tone language, where it refers to the use of pitch to make contrasts of
meaning at word level.

intrinsic (adj.) (1)
A term used in generative grammar, referring to a type of
constraint imposed on the ordering of rules (as opposed to a condition
where such rules are allowed to apply in a random order). An intrinsic ordering
is one where the formal or logical properties of a system of rules dictate the
sequence in which the rules apply: one rule (B) cannot apply until after another
rule (A) has operated, because A supplies B with the properties B needs for
its operation. Intrinsic ordering is opposed to extrinsic ordering, where the
order of application is not motivated by such considerations of formal consist-
ency; the rules could logically occur in any order, but some ordering has to be
imposed (taking into account the data of the language) in order for a correct
output to emerge.
(2)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to a property of sound
which is thought to be crucial to the identity of a contrast. A segment of
a particular type must have the property before it can be perceived to belong to
that type. For example, a tiny amount of friction follows the release of a stop
consonant, but as the duration of this friction exceeds a certain minimal
amount, so the segment will be perceived as an affricate; a longer duration
will lead to its perception as a fricative. Such examples of intrinsic duration
can also be found in vowels, where low vowels are intrinsically longer than
high vowels. Intrinsic pitch relates to high vowels having a higher pitch than
low vowels.
intrusion (n.)
A term used occasionally in phonetics and phonology to refer
to the addition of sounds in connected speech which have no basis in the
pronunciation of the syllables or words heard in isolation. The most well-
known example in English (received pronunciation) is the intrusive /r/ which
is introduced as a linking form after a vowel, when the following word
begins with a vowel, where there is no historical justiﬁcation for it (i.e. there is
no r in the spelling). Examples such as law(r) and order, India(r) and Pakistan,
and (within word) draw(r)ings are common, and attract much criticism, though
the frequency with which such forms are heard (the critics not excluded) indic-
ates that the tendency of this accent to link words in this way is deep-rooted.
But one may hear other cases of intrusion, such as the introduction of an
unstressed, schwa vowel between consonants in such words as athletics
/aθvlet}ks/.
As with the opposite effect, elision, traditional rhetoric had devised a classiﬁca-
tion of types of intrusion in terms of the position of the extra sound in a word:
in word-initial position, it was termed prothesis, in word-medial position
anaptyxis or epenthesis, and in word-ﬁnal position paragoge. In phonetic ana-
lyses of modern languages, too, reference to a ‘prothetic’ vowel or an ‘epenthetic’
vowel is often encountered.
intrusive r
see intrusion
intuition (n.)
A term in linguistics referring to the judgement of speakers
about their language, especially in deciding whether a sentence is acceptable
or not, and how sentences are interrelated. It is sometimes referred to as tacit
knowledge, or Sprachgefühl. Native-speaker intuitions are always a crucial form
of evidence in linguistic analysis, but they are given a special theoretical status
intuition
253

in generative grammar, where in his later work Noam Chomsky sees them
as part of the data which the grammar has to account for. It is important,
in discussion of this topic, to distinguish the intuitive responses of the native-
speaker from those of the linguist – a distinction which can be easily confused
when linguists are investigating their own language. Linguists’ intuitions
concerning the accuracy or elegance of their analyses are quite different in kind
from those of non-linguists, whose intuitions concern the sameness, difference
and relatedness of meanings.
invariable (adj.)
A term sometimes used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of
words to refer to one of two postulated major word-classes in language,
the other being variable. Invariable or invariant words are said to be those
which are used without any morphological change, e.g. under, but, them.
Variable words, by contrast, inﬂect, e.g. house/houses, sit/sat . . .
invariance (n.)
A principle in some approaches to phonology whereby each
phoneme is seen as having a set of deﬁning phonetic features, such that
whenever a phoneme occurs the corresponding features will occur. Along with
the conditions of linearity and biuniqueness, the invariance principle estab-
lishes a view of phonemic analysis which has been criticized by generative
phonologists, as part of a general attack on taxonomic phonemics.
invariant (adj.)
see invariable, invariance
inventory (n.)
A term used in linguistics and phonetics to refer to an
unordered listing of the items belonging to a particular level or area of
description in a language; e.g. the listing of the phonemes of English would
constitute that language’s ‘phonemic inventory’.
inversion (n.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to the process or
result of syntactic change in which a speciﬁc sequence of constituents is
seen as the reverse of another. In English, for example, one of the main ways of
forming questions is by inverting the order of subject and auxiliary, e.g. Is
he going?
IPA
see International Phonetic Association
irrealis /}r}cwpl}s/ (adj.)
see realis
irregular (adj.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a linguistic form which
is an exception to the pattern stated in a rule. For example, verbs such as
took, went, saw, etc., are irregular, because they do not follow the rule which
forms the past tense by adding -ed. grammar is concerned with the discovery
of regular patterns in linguistic data: lists of irregularities are usually avoided,
and handled by incorporating the exceptional information into a dictionary entry.
-ise/-ize
In phonetics, a sufﬁx used to identify the place or process of
articulation of a secondary stricture, as in ‘labialize’, ‘velarized’ (see secondary
articulation); an associated process sufﬁx is -isation/-ization. For example,
[tj] would be described as a ‘palatalized t’. Both dynamic and static interpretations
254
invariable

are used: a sound is described as ‘labialized’ both (a) during the process of lab-
ialization, and (b) once that process is over.
(2)
In historical linguistics and sociolinguistics, a sufﬁx used to char-
acterize a change of a sound from one place of articulation to another: for
example, a change from [k] to [c] or [t] to [c] could be described as a process of
‘palatalization’. This sense needs to be kept clearly distinct from (1) above: the
palatalization of [t] as [tj] is very different from [t] as [c].
island (n.)
A term originally used in transformational grammar to refer to
a structure out of which constituents cannot be moved by any movement
rule; more generally, a constituent across whose boundary certain relations
between two elements cannot be held. For example, the constituents of a
relative clause cannot be moved out of the clause: in the sentence I saw the
person who bought my car, the relative-clause constituents cannot be moved to
other positions in the sentence without producing an unacceptable sentence (e.g.
*What did I see the person who brought?). Other structures which may have
been proposed as islands are noun-complement clauses (e.g. The fact that
Mary was angry surprised me), subject noun clauses (e.g. What she told me
was this), co-ordinate structures (e.g. I saw Jules and Jim), deﬁnite NPs (e.g.
I read the story about Jim), adjunct phrases (e.g. I read the book after she
wrote the book), and constructions to which the A-over-A principle applies.
The island condition in X-bar syntax asserts that constituents can be extracted
out of complement phrases, but not out of subject/adjunct phrases (the condi-
tion on extraction domain). See also wh-.
iso-
A preﬁx used in dialectology as part of the labelling of the various
types of linguistic information which can be displayed on maps (‘linguistic
atlases’). The most widely used notion is that of the isogloss (or isograph, or
isoglottic line), a line drawn on a map to mark the boundary of an area in which
a particular linguistic feature is used. A number (or ‘bundle’) of isoglosses falling
together in one place suggests the existence of a dialect boundary. Further
distinctions can be made in terms of the kind of linguistic feature being isolated:
an isophone is a line drawn to mark the limits of a phonological feature: an
isomorph marks the limits of a morphological feature; an isolex marks the
limits of a lexical item; an isoseme marks the limits of a semantic feature
(as when lexical items of the same phonological form take on different meanings
in different areas). Other distinctions have been suggested, based on the same
principle. An alternative terminology talks of isophonic/isomorphic/ . . . ‘lines’.
An isopleth is a more general notion, being used by some sociolinguists to
refer to a line which marks the limits of a linguistic feature seen in association
with relevant sociocultural features. An isolect is a term used by some socio-
linguists to refer to a linguistic variety (or lect) which differs minimally from
another variety (i.e. a single isogloss, whether of a regional or a social kind,
differentiates them).
isochronism (n.)
see isochrony
isochrony (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to the rhy-
thmic characteristic of some languages; also sometimes called isochronism. In
isochronous rhythm, the stressed syllables fall at approximately regular
isochrony
255

intervals throughout an utterance. This is ‘subjective’ isochrony, based on the
perception of the listener – a more realistic interpretation of this notion than
that of ‘objective’ isochrony, where the intervals would be measurably identical.
One implication of this is that the theory predicts that unstressed syllables between
stresses will be uttered in similar periods of time. If there are several unstressed
syllables, accordingly, they will be articulated rapidly, to get them into the time
span available. In such sentences as The cconsequences of his caction are cseveral,
the speed of articulation of the ﬁve syllables after ccon- will be greater than
the two following cac-. Isochrony is said to be a strong tendency in English, for
example, which is accordingly referred to as a stress-timed (as opposed to a
‘syllable-timed’) language. The units of rhythm in such languages, i.e. the dis-
tances between stressed syllables, are called feet (see foot) by some phoneti-
cians. The theory is not without its critics, who doubt the extent of the principle’s
applicability, given the many variations in tempo heard in speech.

see iso-
isolate (n.)
In comparative linguistics, a term for a language with little or
no structural or historical relationship to any other language; also called an
isolated language or a language isolate. Many such cases have been noted. They
include languages which remain undeciphered, languages where there is insufﬁ-
cient material available to establish a family relationship, and languages where,
despite a great deal of data, the relationship is undetermined.
isolated (adj.)
A type of opposition recognized in Prague School phono-
logy, distinguished from proportional. The opposition between English /v/
and /l/ is isolated, because there are no other segments that are contrasted in this
particular way, i.e. voiced labio-dental fricative v. voiced lateral. The
opposition between /f/ and /v/, however, is proportional, because there are other
oppositions in the language which work in parallel, e.g. /s/ v. /z/, /θ/ v. /¨/.
isolated language
see isolate
isolating (adj.)
A term which characterizes a type of language established by
comparative linguistics using structural (as opposed to diachronic) cri-
teria, and focusing on the characteristics of the word: in isolating languages, all
the words are invariable (and syntactic relationships are primarily shown by
word-order). Vietnamese, Chinese and many South-East Asian languages are
often cited as good instances of isolating languages. As always with such general
classiﬁcations, the categories are not clear-cut: different languages will display
the characteristics of isolation to a greater or lesser degree. An alternative term
is analytic, seen as opposed to synthetic types of language (agglutinative
and inﬂecting), where words contain more than one morpheme.
isolation (adj.)

isolect, isolex, isomorph, isophone, isopleth, isoseme (n.)

isomorphism (n.)
A property of two or more structures whose constituent
parts are in a one-to-one correspondence with each other, at a given level of
256
isogloss

abstraction. For example, a syntactic and a semantic analysis would be
isomorphic if for each syntactic unit there were a corresponding semantic unit,
e.g. subject+verb+object: actor+action+goal. Likewise, a structural isomorph-
ism may occur between languages or dialects, e.g. in vocabulary (the kinship
terms in language X may be isomorphic with those in language Y).
isosyllabism, isosyllabicity (n.)
see syllable-timed
item (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to an individual linguistic form,
from the viewpoint of its occurrence in an inventory and not in a classiﬁca-
tion. For example, the vocabulary of a language, as listed in a dictionary, can
be seen as a set of ‘lexical items’ (e.g. the headwords in this dictionary).
grammatical and phonological units may also be listed as items, though
this is less common, as they are more readily analysable into classes.
item and arrangement (IA)
A model of description used in morphology for
the analysis of words (and sometimes in syntax for larger grammatical units).
In this approach, words are seen as linear sequences (‘arrangements’) of morphs
(‘items’), e.g. The boys kicked the ball will be analysed as the+boy+s+kick+ed+
the+ball. Problem cases, where this notion of sequence would not easily apply,
constituted a main part of discussion linguistics in the 1940s and 1950s, e.g.
whether mice can be seen as mouse + plural. The chief alternatives to this way
of proceeding are the item-and-process and word-and-paradigm models.
item and process (IP)
A model of description used in morphology for
the analysis of words. In this approach, the relationships between words are
seen as processes of derivation; e.g. the ‘item’ took is derived from the item
take by a ‘process’ involving vowel change. For some linguists this label is
applicable to any approach which makes use of derivational processes in its
formulation, such as generative grammar; but its original use was in the
context of morphology.
iteration (n.)
A term sometimes used in linguistics as an alternative to re-
cursion – the repeated application of a rule in the generation of a sentence.
Iterative rules are especially used in phonology, where a particular process
(such as vowel harmony or stress assignment) needs to be applied repeatedly
in a word or phrase.
iterative (adj.) (1)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of aspect, to
refer to an event which takes place repeatedly, e.g. ‘jump several times’. Iterative
in this context often contrasts with semelfactive.
(2)
See iteration, iterativity.
iterativity (n.)
In some versions of metrical phonology, a parameter which
determines the extent to which a foot structure may be repeatedly applied. In
non-iterative systems, words have a single foot at the edge. In iterative (or
bidirectional) systems, there is a non-iterative foot assignment at one edge and
an iterative foot assignment at the other.

J
Jakobsonian (adj.)
Characteristic of, or a follower of, the linguistic principles
of the American linguist Roman Jakobson (1896–1983), a principal founder
of the Prague School, and a major inﬂuence on contemporary linguistics. Two
terms in particular are associated with his name, ‘Jakobsonian distinctive
feature theory’ refers to the use he and other scholars made of the notion of
distinctive feature in the mid-1950s, in which features are deﬁned primarily in
acoustic terms. In this dictionary, the main reference to this approach is cited
as ‘Jakobson and Halle’ (i.e. R. Jakobson and M. Halle, Fundamentals of Lan-
guage (1956)). In language acquisition, the Jakobsonian hypothesis concerns
the order in which he predicted oppositions between sounds would appear
(and also be lost, in cases of language breakdown).
jaw setting
In phonetics, a term used in the classiﬁcation of the characteristic
jaw (or mandible) positions adopted during speech. In a neutral jaw position,
a small vertical gap is just visible between the biting surfaces of the upper and
lower teeth. In various degrees of ‘close’ jaw settings, this gap disappears, until
one reaches clenched teeth; in ‘open’ jaw settings, several degrees of opening are
possible.

juncture (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology to refer to the phonetic boundary
features which may demarcate grammatical units such as morpheme, word
or clause. The most obvious junctural feature is silence, but in connected
speech this feature is not as common as the use of various modiﬁcations to
the beginnings and endings of grammatical units. Word division, for example,
can be signalled by a complex of pitch, stress, length and other features, as
in the potential contrast between that stuff and that’s tough. In a segmental
phonological transcription, these appear identical, /ÎætstÎf/, but there are
several phonetic modiﬁcations which can differentiate them in speech. In that

stuff the /s/ is strongly articulated and the /t/ is unaspirated, whereas in that’s
tough the /s/ is relatively weak and the /t/ is aspirated. In rapid speech such
distinctions may disappear: they are only potentially contrastive.
There have been several attempts to establish a typology of junctures. A
commonly used distinction is between open or plus juncture (the features used
at a word boundary, before silence), as illustrated in the above example (usually
transcribed with a plus sign <+>), and close juncture (referring to the normal
transitions between sounds within a word). To handle the special cases of an
open transition within a word, as in co-opt, the notion of internal open juncture
may be used. A more general distinction sometimes used to handle these possib-
ilities is that between ‘open’ and ‘close’ transition. See also pause.
In some American analyses of the intonation patterns of larger grammatical
units than the word, several types of juncture are distinguished: single-bar or
sustained juncture is recognized when the pitch pattern stays level within an
utterance (transcribed with a single forward slash </> or a level arrow <→>);
double-bar or rising juncture is recognized when the pitch pattern rises before a
silence (transcribed with a double slash <//> or a rising arrow <Ã>); a terminal,
double-cross, falling or fading juncture is recognized when the pitch pattern falls
before a silence (transcribed with a double cross <#> or a falling arrow <°>).
(2)
Juncture is used in role and reference grammar to describe that part of
the grammar which deals with how sub-clausal units combine. It is seen in
association with a theory of nexus – the type of syntactic relationship which
obtains between the units in the juncture.
jussive (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in the grammatical analysis of verbs,
to refer to a type of mood often equated with an imperative (leave!), but in
some languages needing to be distinguished from it. For example, in Amharic, a
jussive paradigm is used for wishes (‘May God give you strength’), greetings,
and certain other contexts, and this is formally distinct from the imperative.
just noticeable difference (JND)
A term from psychophysics, referring to the
minimal change along some physical dimension (such as frequency or intens-
ity) which needs to take place before a listener can perceive that something has
happened. It is especially encountered in auditory phonetics.
just noticeable difference

K
Katz–Postal hypothesis
A proposed property of transformations claimed
by the American linguists Jerrold Katz (1932–2002) and Paul Postal (b. 1936)
in 1964 in their book An Integrated Theory of Linguistic Descriptions, which
had considerable inﬂuence on subsequent discussions of the relationship
between syntactic and semantic analysis. Essentially, the hypothesis argued
that all transformations should not change meaning (they should be meaning-
preserving). In relation to the model of grammar expounded by Noam
Chomsky in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), it came to be argued that
whenever two sentences differ in meaning they will differ in deep structure;
and that accordingly, from a consideration of deep structure, the grammatical
meaning of a sentence can be deduced, which can then provide the input to
the semantic component. The removal of meaning-changing transforma-
tions, on this view, would thus simplify the functioning of the semantic rules.
There are, of course, several areas of syntax which provide apparent counter-
examples to this hypothesis (such as tag questions, or the introduction
of conjunctions), and these provided the grounds of much subsequent discus-
sion as to the validity of this and similarly motivated hypotheses. Considerable
effort was made to apply the hypothesis to such cases, by reformulating
the analyses (usually by adding extra elements to the underlying structures
involved).
kernel (adj./n.)
A term used in early generative grammar to refer to a type
of structure produced by the phrase-structure rules of a grammar. The
output of these rules is a kernel string. The basic type of sentence generated
from this string without any optional transformations (as deﬁned in the
Syntactic Structures model, e.g. negative or passive) is a kernel sentence –
corresponding to the simple, active, afﬁrmative declarative (SAAD) sen-
tences of language. The term kernel clause is also sometimes used.
key (n.) (1)
A term used by some sociolinguists as part of a classiﬁcation of
variations in spoken interaction: it refers to the tone, manner or spirit in which
a speech act is carried out, e.g. the contrast between mock and serious styles
of activity. In a more restricted sense, the term is used by some linguists to
subsume the various levels of formality found in speech. One proposal analyses

kinaesthetic/kinesthetic feedback
In phonetics, a term describing the internal
process which enables speakers to be aware of the movements and positions of
their vocal organs during speech; also called kin(a)esthesia or kin(a)esthesis.
People sense movement or strain in their muscles, tendons and joints, and uncon-
sciously use this information to monitor what takes place when they speak.
Interference with this process (following a dental anaesthetic, for example) can
severely hinder a person’s ability to talk normally.

kinesics (n.)
A term in semiotics for the systematic use of facial expression
and body gesture to communicate meaning, especially as this relates to the
use of language (e.g. when a smile or a frown alters the interpretation of a
sentence). In language acquisition studies, the notion is present, under the
heading of ‘developmental’ kinesics. Some analysts have applied the full emic
terminology to this area, distinguishing kinemes, kines and allokines; but the
extent to which one can handle ‘body language’ in these terms is controversial,
as analytic criteria are less clear than in phonology, and kinesic transcrip-
tions raise several problems of interpretation.
kinetic (adj.)
A term sometimes used in phonology, applied to tones which
vary in pitch range; also called ‘dynamic’ or ‘contour’ tones, and contrasted
with ‘static’ or ‘level’ tones.
kinship terms
In semantics, the system of lexical items used in a language
to express personal relationships within the family, in both narrow and extended
senses. The formal analysis of such terminology is often carried on using
componential analysis. The topic has attracted particular interest among
linguists becuase of the way languages make different lexical distinctions within
what is a clearly deﬁned biological domain. Unlike English, other languages may
have separate lexical items for male and female cousins, or for maternal and
paternal aunts, or there may be no lexical contrast between brothers and cousins,
or between father and uncles.
Kleene star (*)
A mathematical term sometimes used in linguistics to refer
to an operator used in a formalism to specify a match for zero or more
occurrences of the preceding expression. For example, se*t would match such
strings as st, seet, seeet, etc; also called the Kleene closure. It is named after US
mathematician Stephen Kleene (1909–94).

knowledge about language
A term which emerged in the 1980s, along with its
acronym KAL /kal/, to identify a strategic goal of educational linguistic
work in the UK. It involved the fostering of an increased awareness of the
structure and function of spoken and written language by children as they
move through the school curriculum. Although an essential element in linguistic
approaches to language study for many years, the notion received a fresh lease
of life from the report published by the Committee of Inquiry into English
Language Teaching (known as the Kingman Report) in 1988, and the sub-
sequent development of the country’s National Curriculum in English, in which
a range of targets for developing language awareness was speciﬁed.
koine /ckÑ}nip/ (n.)
The spoken language of a locality which has become a
standard language or lingua franca. The term was originally used with
reference to the Greek language used throughout the eastern Mediterranean
countries during the Hellenistic and Roman periods; but it is now applied to
cases where a vernacular has come to be used throughout an area in which
several languages or dialects are spoken, as in such notions as (for Old English)
‘West Saxon literary koine’ or (for US-inﬂuenced British English) ‘mid-Atlantic
koine’.

L
labelling (n.)
A term in grammatical analysis for the explicit marking of the
parts or stages in a structural analysis of a sentence. For example, the main
structural divisions in the sentence People ran can be signalled using such
methods as bracketing or a tree diagram, e.g. [[people] [ran]]; but this ana-
lysis is made more meaningful if a structural description is added (assigned)
to the brackets through the use of labels, e.g. [[people]N[ran]V]S where N = noun,
V = verb and S = sentence. Such a convention is known as a labelled bracketing.
In a tree diagram nodes can be labelled similarly.
labial (adj./n.)
A general term in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds
on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to active use of one lip (as
in labio-dental sounds, such as [f]) or both lips (as in bilabial consonants,
such as [b], or rounded vowels, such as [u]). In an empty sense, all oral sounds
are labial, in that the airﬂow has to pass through the lips: the important qualiﬁca-
tion in the above deﬁnition is that the lips are actively involved. From a position of
rest, there must be a marked movement to qualify as a labial sound (‘a labial’),
and it is lip-rounding which is the most common and noticeable feature.
Similarly, labialization is a general term referring to a secondary articula-
tion involving any noticeable lip-rounding, as in the initial [k] of coop, or sh-
[à] of shoe, which are here labialized, because of the inﬂuence of the labialization
in the following vowel [u]. Labialization is applied both to cases where the
lip-rounding is an essential feature of a sound’s identity, as in [u], and to cases
where the lip-rounding is found only in speciﬁc contexts, as in the [k] example
above – in kill, there is no labialization. The diacritic for labialization is
[w], underneath the main symbol, but a raised [w] is often used. The term has
developed a special status in phonological theory, especially in various non-
linear models. For example, in articulator-based feature theory, it refers
to a single-valued node involving the lips as an active articulator. In constric-
tion-based models, it is deﬁned as a constriction formed by the lower lip. See
also -ise/ize.
labio-dental (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech
sounds on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound in
which one lip is actively in contact with the teeth. The usual mode of operation

for a labio-dental sound (‘a labio-dental’) is for the lower lip to articulate with
the upper teeth, as in [f] and [v]. The opposite effect, upper lip against lower
teeth, is possible in theory, but not recognized in the usual phonetic classiﬁca-
tions. The term is also applied to articulations where the lip approaches close to
the teeth, but without actual contact, as in the sound [ä], which is a vowel-like
sound midway between [w] and [v]. See also dental, -ise/-ize.
labio-velar (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds
on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made at
the velum (see velar) with the simultaneous accompaniment of lip-rounding.
A ‘labio-velar semi-vowel’ occurs in English as /w/, e.g. well, wasp; some
accents preserve a voiceless phoneme /Ï/ for words written with wh, and
thus contrast such pairs as Wales and whales. See also -ise/-ize.
LAD

lag (n.)
A term used in acoustic phonetics as part of the study of voice-
onset time variations in initial plosive consonants; voicing lag refers to the
occurrence of voicing after the plosive release (burst); it contrasts with ‘voicing
lead’.
la-la theory
The name of one of the speculative theories about the origins of
language (also called the sing-song theory): it argues that speech originated in
song, play and other aspects of the romantic side of life. The intonation
system provides some evidence, but the gap between the emotional and the
rational aspects of speech expression remains to be explained. The term has no
standing in contemporary linguistics.
lambda (n.) (λ) (1)
A notion developed in mathematical logic and used as
part of the conceptual apparatus underlying formal semantics. The lambda
operator is a device which constructs expressions denoting functions out of
other expressions (e.g. those denoting truth values) in a process called lambda
abstraction. The process of relating equivalent lambda expressions is known as
lambda conversion. Several kinds of lambda calculus have been devised as part
of a general theory of functions and logic, functions here being deﬁned as sets
of unordered pairs (graphs). The approach has proved attractive to linguists
because of its ability to offer a powerful system for formalizing exact meanings
and semantic relationships, and lambda notions have helped to inform a number
of linguistic theories, notably Montague grammar and categorial grammar.

In acoustics, the symbol for wavelength.
Lambek calculus
A version of categorial grammar developed by logician
Joachim Lambek (b. 1922) as a model of natural language syntax, and later
adopted by linguists working in this framework. The calculus draws close parallels
between syntactic parsing and natural deduction systems in logic.
lamina (n.)

laminal (adj.)
A term used in phonetic classiﬁcation, referring to a sound

teeth or alveolar ridge, as in alveolar (i.e. lamino-alveolar) or dental (i.e.
lamino-dental) sounds. A distinction needs to be made with laminar in acoustics,
which refers to the smoothness of ﬂow of a ﬂuid (in this case, air) across a
surface.

langage /lFìapè/ (n.)
A French term introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure to refer
to the human biological faculty of speech. It is distinguished in his approach
from langue, the language system of a speech community.
language (n.)
The everyday use of this term involves several different
mass-noun and count-noun senses (as ‘language in general’ v. ‘a language in
particular’), which linguistics is careful to distinguish. At its most speciﬁc
level, it may refer to the concrete act of speaking, writing or signing (see sign
language) in a given situation – the notion of parole, or performance. The
linguistic system underlying an individual’s use of language in a given time and
place is identiﬁed by the term idiolect – and this is often extended to the
synchronic analysis of the whole of a person’s language (as in ‘Shakespeare’s
language’). A particular variety, or level, of speech/writing may also be
referred to as ‘language’ (e.g. ‘scientiﬁc language’, ‘bad language’), and this
is related to the sociolinguistic or stylistic restrictiveness involved in such
terms as ‘trade language’ (see pidgin), the teaching of ‘languages for special
purposes’ (in applied linguistics), etc. In computational linguistics, a
variety may be referred to as a ‘sublanguage’. In such phrases as ‘ﬁrst language’,
‘the English language’, the sense is the abstract system underlying the collective
totality of the speech/writing behaviour of a community (the notion of langue),
or the knowledge of this system by an individual (the notion of competence).
In later Chomskyan linguistics, a distinction is drawn between language viewed
as an element of the mind (I-language) and language viewed independently of
the mind (E-language). The notion of language may be seen both in a synchronic
sense (e.g. ‘the English language today’) and a diachronic sense (e.g. ‘the
English language since Chaucer’). Higher-order groupings can be made, as in
such notions as ‘the Romance languages’, ‘creole languages’. All of these
examples would fall under the heading of ‘natural languages’ – a term which
contrasts with the artiﬁcially constructed systems used to expound a conceptual
area (e.g. ‘formal’, ‘logical’, ‘computer’ languages) or to facilitate communica-
tion (e.g. Esperanto).
In contrast with these instances of individual languages, dialects, varieties,
etc., there is also the abstract sense of ‘language’, referring to the biological
‘faculty’ which enables individuals to learn and use their language – implicit
in the notion of ‘language acquisition device’ in psycholinguistics. At a
comparably abstract level ‘language’ is seen as a deﬁning feature of human
behaviour – the universal properties of all speech/writing systems, especially
as characterized in terms of ‘design features’ (e.g. productivity, duality,
learnability) or ‘language universals’ (formal, substantive, etc.). Linguistics
does not, however, follow the popular application of the term to human modes
language
265

of communication other than by speech and writing (cf. such phrases as ‘body
language’, ‘eye language’), on the grounds that the behaviours involved are
different in kind (as the criteria of productivity and duality suggest). Nor is
‘language’ a term generally applied to natural animal communication (see
zoösemiotics), except in a metaphorical way.
The term enters into several technical phrases, most of which are self-evident,
e.g. ‘language teaching’, ‘language learning’, ‘language change’. Some, however,
require a minimum of elucidation. For example, ﬁrst language (sc. mother-
tongue) is distinguishable from second language (a language other than one’s
mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government), dis-
tinguishable in turn from foreign language (where no such special status is
implied) – though the distinction between the latter two is not universally recog-
nized (especially not in the USA). Other terms involving ‘language’ are found in
their alphabetical place.
language acquisition device
see acquisition
language areas
In neurolinguistics, the areas of the brain which seem to be
most closely implicated in speaking, listening, reading, writing and signing,
mainly located at or around the Sylvian and Rolandic ﬁssures; also called the
language centres. For example, an area in the lower back part of the frontal lobe
is primarily involved in the encoding of speech (Broca’s area); an area in the
upper back part of the temporal lobe, extending upwards into the parietal lobe,
is important in the comprehension of speech (Wernicke’s area). Other areas
are involved in speech perception, visual perception and the motor control of
speaking, writing and signing.
language attitudes
A term used in sociolinguistics for the feelings people
have about their own language or the language(s) of others. These may be
positive or negative: someone may particularly value a foreign language (e.g.
because of its literary history) or think that a language is especially difﬁcult to
learn (e.g. because the script is off-putting). Rural accents generally receive a
positive evaluation, whereas urban accents do not. Knowing about attitudes is
an important aspect of evaluating the likely success of a language teaching
programme or a piece of language planning.
language attrition
see language death
language awareness
A term used especially in educational linguistics, to
refer to an informed, sensitive and critical response to the use of language by
oneself and others, including the awareness of relevant terminology (metalinguistic
awareness). A particular impetus was given to the task of promoting linguistic
awareness in the early 1990s, when new perspectives on language teaching in
schools came to be adopted in several countries.
language centers/centres
see language areas
language change
In historical linguistics, a general term referring to change
within a language over a period of time, seen as a universal and unstoppable
266
language acquisition device

process. The phenomenon was ﬁrst systematically investigated by comparative
philologists at the end of the eighteenth century, and in the twentieth century
by historical linguists and sociolinguists. All aspects of language are involved,
though most attention has been paid to phonology and lexis, where change is
most noticeable and frequent. See also change from above, language shift,
sound change.
language contact
see contact (1)
language death
A term used in linguistics for the situation which arises when
a language ceases to be used by a community; also called language loss or obso-
lescence, especially when referring to the loss of language ability in an individual.
The term language attrition is sometimes used when the loss is gradual rather
than sudden. See also endangered language, obsolescence (2).

language learning
In applied linguistics and psycholinguistics, the process
of internalizing a language – either a mother-tongue or a foreign language.
The factors which affect this process (such as the individual’s intelligence, memory
and motivation to learn) are seen as separate from those involved in the task of
language teaching.
language loss (1)
A term used in language pathology for the disappearance
of language in an individual as a result of some trauma, such as brain damage or
shock. The loss may be permanent or temporary, and varies in the severity with
which it affects different aspects of language structure.
(2)
See language death.
language loyalty
A term used in sociolinguistics referring to a concern to
preserve the use of a language or the traditional form of a language, when that
language is perceived to be under threat. For example, many ﬁrst-generation
immigrants to a country are extremely loyal to their ﬁrst language, but attitudes
vary in the second generation. See also language attitudes, language main-
tenance, language shift.
language maintenance
A term used in sociolinguistics, referring to the extent
to which people continue to use a language once they are part of a community
in which another language has a dominant position. For example, immigrant
groups may maintain their language, out of a sense of language loyalty,
despite the dominance of the language of their host country (as has often happened
language maintenance
267

in the USA); or a community may continue with its language successfully despite
the presence of a conquering nation (as happened with English after the Norman
Conquest). See also language planning, language shift.
language minority

language of thought
see mentalese
language pathology
The study of all forms of involuntary, abnormal language
behaviour, especially when associated with medical conditions; also called speech
pathology. The term is also used of the behaviours themselves: aphasia, for
example, could be described as a type of language pathology. A practitioner of
the subject is called (especially in the USA) a speech pathologist or (especially in
the UK) a speech and language therapist, with speech therapist still commonly
used in the UK, and language pathologist sometimes encountered elsewhere.
The subject includes disorders of speaking, listening, reading and writing, and
applies both to developmental abnormalities in children and to acquired abnorm-
alities in children or adults. Any recognized area of linguistic structure and use
is covered by the term, especially disorders in grammar, semantics, phonology
and pragmatics. ‘Language pathology’ is broader in its implications than ‘speech
pathology’, though in practice the subject-matter and professional expertise
referred to by the two domains are similar. However, disorders of a primarily
phonetic nature (such as dysarthria and dysphonia) are traditionally described
as being disorders of speech (in a narrow sense) as opposed to ‘language’, on
the grounds that they lack any meaningful or symbolic function; and disorders
of reading and writing are often excluded or marginalized in the study of speech
pathology, whereas they are central to work in remedial educational settings.
The term ‘pathology’ is itself controversial, because of its medical connotations:
therapists are often unhappy about using it to refer to disorders (such as stutter-
ing) which lack a clear medical cause. See also clinical linguistics.
language pedagogy
see educational linguistics
language planning
A term used in sociolinguistics for a deliberate, systematic
and theory-based attempt to solve the communication problems of a community
by studying its various languages and dialects, and developing an ofﬁcial
language policy concerning their selection and use; often referred to as language
engineering and sometimes as language treatment. Corpus planning deals with
the way language norms are chosen and codiﬁed, as when a variety is selected
to be a national language, a spelling system is reformed, campaigns for plain or
non-sexist language are launched, and literacy programmes are introduced. It
contrasts with status planning, which deals with the standing of one language in
relation to others. Status planning is thus more concerned with the social and
political implications of choosing a language, and with such matters as language
attitudes, national identity, international use, and minority rights. For example,
the relative standing of French and English in Canada, and such matters as the
law governing their use in ofﬁcial documents, is a matter of status planning;
the choice of which variety of French is to be taught as a standard in Canadian
268
language minority

schools, and the provision of relevant teaching materials, is a matter of corpus
planning. See also corpus (1).

language revitalization program(me)
A programme of support or teaching
designed to improve the use of an endangered language or a minority
language, especially one which is close to extinction. Several such programmes
are to be found around the world, as in the case of various American Indian
languages, Irish Gaelic and Welsh.
language shift
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to the gradual or
sudden move from the use of one language to another, either by an individual
or by a group. It is particularly found among second- and third-generation
immigrants, who often lose their attachment to their ancestral language, faced
with the pressure to communicate in the language of the host country. Language
shift may also be actively encouraged by the government policy of the host
country. See also language loyalty, language planning.
language socialization
In child language acquisition, a term describing the
gradual development in children of patterns of language use which reproduce
the adult system of social order. For example, adult expectations of politeness
(e.g. ‘Say please’, ‘Don’t say she’) are explicitly introduced into conversations
with children from around age 3.

langue /l5g/ (n.)
A French term introduced into linguistics by Ferdinand de
Saussure (see Saussurean), to distinguish one of the senses of the word ‘lan-
guage’ (the others being langage and parole). It refers to the language system
shared by a community of speakers, and is usually contrasted with ‘parole’,
which is the concrete act of speaking in actual situations by an individual
(compare competence and performance).

larynx (n.)
The part of the windpipe, or trachea, containing the vocal folds.
The larynx, or ‘voice box’, is a casing of muscle and cartilage, which at the front
is most noticeable in the protruberance in the adult male neck known as the
‘Adam’s apple’. Its functions are both biological and linguistic. Under the
larynx
269

former heading, the larynx acts as a valve to shut off the lungs, e.g. to aid
the process of exertion. Under the latter heading, the larynx is involved in the
production of several types of sound effect (e.g. voicing, pitch, whisper, glottal
stop, glottalic sounds): these functions are described more fully under vocal
folds. Speech sounds made in the larynx are sometimes referred to as laryngeals,
and this term has come to be used in some models of non-linear phonology,
where a laryngeal node may be represented within the feature hierarchy, within
which is grouped a series of laryngeal features representing various states of
the vocal folds (e.g. spread v. constricted, voiced v. unvoiced, stiff v. slack).
Laryngealization refers to variation in the mode of vibration of the vocal folds,
over and above their normal vibratory mode in the production of voice, as in
creaky voice. Laryngealized sounds are sometimes used contrastively with
non-laryngealized sounds in language, e.g. in Hausa. See -ise/-ize.
The traditional method of examining the inside of the larynx is by using the
laryngoscope, a mirror placed at an angle inside the mouth: several high-speed
ﬁlms of vocal fold activity have been made using this technique. The ﬁbre-optic
laryngoscope allows a more direct and ﬂexible inspection to be made: the ﬁbres
are inserted through the nose, and thus interfere less with normal speech. The
(electro)laryngograph is a device for recording vocal-fold vibrations visually,
using electrodes placed against the appropriate part of the neck.
last-cyclic rules
see cycle (1)
last resort
A term used in the minimalist programme to refer to a syntactic
operation which is applicable only when other options are prohibited. It is one
of various speciﬁc economy principles (another is least effort) which have
been made to maintain a minimalist perspective in the evaluation of deriva-
tions. An example is the use of dummy do in English, which takes place only
when other options for realizing tense and agreement are blocked.
latent consonant
In phonology, a term used to describe a consonant pro-
nounced only under certain circumstances; opposed to ﬁxed consonants, which
are always pronounced. The notion has been used especially in French phono-
logy, in relation to such phenomena as liaison.
lateral (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to any sound where
the air escapes around one or both sides of a closure made in the mouth, as in
the various types of l sound. Air released around only one side of the tongue
produces unilateral sounds; around both sides bilateral sounds. Lateral sounds
may be voiced, as in lady, pool, or voiceless, as in play, where the [l] has been
devoiced due to the inﬂuence of the preceding voiceless consonant: [$]. An
independent voiceless l sound occurs with Welsh ll, as in Llandudno, but here
there is much accompanying friction, and the sound is best described as a
‘lateral fricative’ [l]. /t/ and /d/ followed by /l/ in English are often released
laterally, the phenomenon of ‘lateral plosion’: the air escapes round the sides of
the tongue, the closure between tongue and alveolar ridge remaining, as in
bottle, cuddle. It is possible to say the ﬁnal syllable of such words without
moving the front of the tongue from its contact at all.
270
last-cyclic rules

In some distinctive feature approaches to phonology, the term ‘lateral’
is speciﬁcally opposed to non-lateral (i.e. sounds which do not have a lateral
release, as described above), these being postulated as two of the contrasts
needed in order to specify fully the sound system of a language. In Chomsky
and Halle’s theory (see Chomskyan), for example, ‘lateral’ is classiﬁed as a
cavity feature, along with nasal, under the speciﬁc heading of secondary
apertures.
lattice (n.)
A concept from abstract algebra, sometimes applied in semantic
theory to model mereology (part/whole relations). A lattice is a structured
set in which every pair of elements has a ‘join’ (sum) as well as a ‘meet’ (or
‘product’), conforming to certain conditions. Sometimes the weaker notion of a
semi-lattice is used instead, requiring every pair of elements to have a sum but
not necessarily a product.
law (n.)
see sound change
lax (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle (see
Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to handle
variations in manner of articulation. Lax sounds are those produced with
less muscular effort and movement, and which are relatively short and indis-
tinct, compared to tense sounds (see tension). Examples are vowels articulated
nearer the centre of the vowel area (as in bit, put).
layer (n.)
see metrical grid
layering (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the successive hier-
archical levels in an immediate-constituent analysis. In tagmemic gram-
mar, it refers to the inclusion of a tagmemic construction within another
construction at the same level, as in the car in the road, where the phrase is
within a phrase. Here it contrasts with loopback and level-skipping.
lazy pronoun
In grammar and semantics, a term sometimes used for a usage
(quite common in informal speech) where there is an imprecise match between
a pronoun and its antecedent; also called pronoun of laziness. For example,
in X wears her hat every day of the week. Y wears it only on Sundays, the it in
the second sentence should more precisely be hers. In such cases, the pronoun
is being interpreted as equivalent to a repetition of the antecedent, even though
it is not co-referential with it. See also paycheck sentence.
lead (n.)
A term used in acoustic phonetics as part of the study of voice-
onset time variations in initial plosive consonants: voicing lead refers to
the occurrence of voicing before the plosive release (burst); it contrasts with
‘voicing lag’.
leaf node
see node
learnability (n.)
A suggested deﬁning property of human language (contrast-
ing with the properties of other semiotic systems), referring to the way any
learnability
271

language can in principle be acquired by any normal child given the opportunity
to do so. More speciﬁcally, the term is used in linguistics with reference to the
mathematical investigation of the idealized learning procedures needed for the
acquisition of grammars (learnability theory or ‘learning theory’). Because
the emphasis is on the way in which grammars can be induced from linguistic
input, the approach is also characterized as ‘grammar induction’ or ‘grammat-
ical inference’.
learning (n.)

least effort
A common feature of some of the principles in the minimalist
programme involving the comparison of alternative syntactic derivations:
that derivation is preferred which involves the smallest amount of movement
of a constituent within a particular conﬁguration blocks all others. It is
one of various speciﬁc economy principles (another is last resort) which
have been made to maintain a minimalist perspective in the evaluation of
derivations. Examples of such principles are shortest move, greed, and
procrastinate.
lect (n.)
A term used by some sociolinguists to refer to a collection of
linguistic phenomena which has a functional identity within a speech com-
munity, but without specifying the basis on which the collection was made (e.g.
whether the lect was regional (see dialect), social (see sociolect), etc.).
Different levels of identity are recognized within the variety continuum – in
particular, basilect, mesolect and acrolect. grammars which take lectal
variation into account are referred to as panlectal or polylectal.
left-associative grammar
A term used in computational linguistics for a
type of grammar which operates with a regular order of linear compositions.
This approach, based on the building up and cancelling of valencies, aims
to avoid the irregular ordering introduced by constituent structure ana-
lysis which, it claims, results in computational inefﬁciency. Left-associative
parsers are distinctive in that the history of the parse doubles as the linguistic
analysis.
left-branching (adj.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to a con-
struction whose complexity is represented on the left-hand side of a tree
diagram. The type of rule involved can be represented by X ⇒ (X) + Y. For
example, the phrase my friend’s aunt’s pen is a ‘left-branching’ or ‘left recurs-
ive’ structure; it contrasts with the right-branching character of the pen
of the friend of my aunt. Within classical transformational grammar, the
left branch constraint/condition asserts that no element on the left branch of
another noun phrase may be extracted from that noun phrase. The condition
accounts for the unacceptability of English sentences such as *How many did
you read – books?, in which an adjective phrase has been extracted out of the
noun phrase headed by books.

left dislocation
In grammatical description, a type of sentence in which one
of the constituents appears in initial position and its canonical position is
ﬁlled by a pronoun or a full lexical noun phrase with the same reference,
e.g. John, I like him/the old chap. In transformational grammar, left disloca-
tion sentences have been contrasted with topicalization sentences. The former
are analysed as base-generated and the latter as involving movement.

lemma (n.) (1)
In lexicology, the item which occurs at the beginning of a
dictionary entry; more generally referred to as a headword. It is essentially an
abstract representation, subsuming all the formal lexical variations which may
apply: the verb walk, for example, subsumes walking, walks and walked.
(2)
A term used in psycholinguistics referring to the syntactic and semantic
properties of a word represented in the mental lexicon. All features of the
form of a word are thought to be represented separately. The distinction can be
seen in various kinds of speech production error; for example, malapropisms
(e.g. saying illiterate but meaning obliterate) illustrate the possibility that the
correct lemma can be activated but with an incorrect phonetic or morpholo-
gical shape.
length (n.) (1)
A term used in phonetics to refer to the physical duration of
a sound or utterance, and in phonology to refer to the relative durations
of sounds and syllables when these are linguistically contrastive; also referred
to as quantity. Sometimes the term is restricted to phonological contexts,
the phonetic dimension being referred to as ‘duration’. Phonologically long and
short values are conventionally recognized, for both vowels and consonants.
languages often have one degree of phonological length, and may have more
than one. Long vowels (transcribed with the diacritic [p]) occur in Arabic and
Finnish, long consonants (or double consonants) in Italian and Luganda. A fur-
ther contrast of length (over-long or extra-long) is also sometimes encountered
with vowels. In English, the so-called distinction between long and short vowels
(as in beat/bit) is not strictly a contrast in length, as quality variations are
always involved. See also compensatory lengthening, mora, weight.
(2)
The notion of physical length has also been used in psycholinguistic,
sociolinguistic and stylistic studies of grammar and vocabulary, in an
attempt to quantify variations in the apparent complexity of sentences, words,
etc. Notions such as sentence length and mean length of utterance have been
length
273

studied in terms of the number of constituent words, morphemes, syllables,
etc., which they contain. These quantiﬁcations have been criticized by many
linguists, on the grounds that there is no necessary correlation between the
length of a linguistic unit and its structural or functional complexity.
lenis (adj.)
A general term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant
sounds on the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to a sound
made with a relatively weak degree of muscular effort and breath force, com-
pared with some other sound (known as fortis). The distinction between lax
and tense is used similarly. The labels ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ are sometimes used
for the contrast involved, but these are more prone to ambiguity. In English, it
is the voiced consonants ([b], [d], [v], [z], etc.) which tend to be produced
with lenis articulation (their voiceless counterparts being relatively strong), and
often, when the voicing distinction is reduced, it is only the degree of articu-
latory strength which maintains a contrast between sounds. The term ‘lenis’ is
sometimes used loosely to refer to weak vowel articulation also, but this is not
a standard practice.
lenite (v.)
see lenition
lenition (n.)
A term used in phonology to refer to a weakening in the overall
strength of a sound, whether diachronically or synchronically; opposed
to fortition. Typically, lenition involves the change from a stop to a fricative,
a fricative to an approximant, a voiceless sound to a voiced sound, or a
sound being reduced (lenite) to zero. For example, the initial mutation in
Celtic languages shows lenition in such cases as Welsh pen ‘head’ becoming ben
‘(his) head’.
lento (adj.)
A term derived from music and sometimes used in phonetics and
phonology to describe speech produced slowly or with careful articulation;
it contrasts with allegro, where the speech is faster than usual. Several other
music-derived terms have been appropriated for the study of speech prosody,
such as crescendo, diminuendo, rallentando and glissando, though none has
achieved widespread currency.
level (n.) (1)
A general term in linguistics to refer to a major dimension of
structural organization held to be susceptible of independent study. The
most widely recognized levels of analysis are phonology, grammar and
semantics, but often phonetics is distinguished from phonology, lexis from
semantics, and morphology and syntax are seen as separate levels within
grammar. pragmatics is also sometimes described as a level. Some linguistic
models make even more speciﬁc divisions, identifying morphophonology,
for example, as a separate level. An analogous notion is found in all theories,
e.g. the components of a generative grammar, or the strata of stratiﬁca-
tional grammar. There is considerable difference of opinion concerning not
only the number but also the way these levels should be interrelated in a lin-
guistic theory. bloomﬁeldian linguistics, for example, saw analysis as a matter
proceeding unidirectionally from the ‘lower’ levels of phonetics through the
progressively ‘higher’ levels of phonology, morphology and syntax towards
274
lenis

semantics. In this approach, the ‘mixing of levels’ was disallowed: phono-
logy, for example, was to be analysed without reference to higher levels of
description. In hallidayan linguistics, phonology is seen as an inter-level,
linking the level of phonic/graphic substance with that of grammatical/lexical
forms. ‘Double articulation’ theories recognize the main levels only. When
criteria of analysis from different levels coincide in establishing a linguistic
unit (as when phonological and grammatical criteria are found to agree in
identifying the words in a language), the term ‘congruence of levels’ is some-
times used.
(2)
In generative linguistics, level is used to refer to the different types of
representation encountered within the derivation of a sentence. For example,
deep- and surface-structure levels of representation are commonly recognized,
as are systematic phonemic and phonetic levels. Linguistic operations,
such as transformations, can be described as taking place at certain levels
of depth. In X-bar theory, categories are analysed at zero- or word level and
at phrase level. See also lexical phonology.
(3)
The different structural layers within a linguistic hierarchy are often
referred to as levels; e.g. within grammar one might talk of the levels (or ranks)
of sentence, clause, phrase, word and morpheme. This view is a central
feature of tagmemic analysis. In metrical phonology, metrical trees display
different levels of structure (prosodic levels).
(4)
The various degrees of progress which it is anticipated linguistics can achieve
are referred to as levels (or ‘criteria’) of adequacy.
(5)
Within phonetics and phonology, ‘level’ may be used to characterize
(a) the degree of pitch height of an utterance, or syllable, e.g. ‘average pitch
level’, ‘four pitch levels’, or (b) the degree of loudness of a sound, e.g. ‘three
levels of stress’. Level tone is used by some intonation analysts to refer to a
nuclear tone which has neither a falling nor a rising component (as in the
tone of boredom or sarcasm in English, e.g. rea
—lly). Level stress is sometimes
used to refer to compounds where the two items have a major stress feature,
e.g. washing machine.
(6)
In stylistics and sociolinguistics, level is often used to refer to a mode
of expression felt to be appropriate to a type of social situation, e.g. ‘formal
level’, ‘intimate level’. Sometimes, several such stylistic levels are distinguished
within the range of formality (e.g. ‘frozen’, ‘casual’, ‘deliberative’).
levelling (n.)
In historical linguistics, the gradual loss of a linguistic distinc-
tion, so that forms which were originally contrastive become identical. For
example, Old English nouns generally distinguished nominative and accusat-
ive cases, but in Modern English these have been levelled to a single form. The
term is also used in dialectology, where it refers to the lessening of differ-
ences between regional dialects as a result of social forces (such as the media)
which are inﬂuencing people to speak in a similar way. The spread of the
phenomenon of (certain features of) Estuary English throughout England in
the later decades of the twentieth century is an illustration. In phonetics,
analogical levelling is the extension of a phonetic property from one member of
a paradigm to another in contexts that are not otherwise predicted by the
phonological rules of a language; for example, [e] replaced by [v] in condensa-
tion on analogy with condense.
levelling
275

level-skipping (n.)
A term used in tagmemic grammar to refer to a process
of syntactic construction where a level has been omitted. In such cases,
a ﬁller from a lower-level construction is used in a higher-level one, as when
a genitive ending (from the morpheme level) is attached to a phrase, rather
than a word (e.g. the King of Spain’s daughter). It is contrasted with loopback
and layering.
level stress/tone
see level (5)
lexeme (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the minimal distinct-
ive unit in the semantic system of a language. Its original motivation was
to reduce the ambiguity of the term word, which applied to orthographic/
phonological, grammatical and lexical levels, and to devise a more
appropriate term for use in the context of discussing a language’s vocabulary.
The lexeme is thus postulated as the abstract unit underlying such sets of grammat-
ical variants as walk, walks, walking, walked, or big, bigger, biggest. idiomatic
phrases, by this deﬁnition, are also considered lexemic (e.g. kick the bucket
(= ‘die’)). Lexemes are the units which are conventionally listed in dictionaries
as separate entries.
lexical (adj.)
see lexis
lexical access
In psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, the sequence of
processing stages which have to be postulated to explain how speakers retrieve
words from their mental lexicon. Factors inﬂuencing lexical access include
word frequency, age of acquisition, neighbourhood, and stress pattern, as
well as the linguistic context in which the word appears. In studies of aphasia,
difﬁculties of lexical access are usually called ‘word-ﬁnding problems’.
lexical ambiguity
see ambiguity
lexical array
In later versions of the minimalist programme, a set of lexical
items out of which an expression is formed; a similar notion is called numera-
tion in earlier versions. Lexical array is distinguished from numeration in that
the latter is simply the set of all lexical items in the sentence to be constructed,
whereas a lexical array permits subsets (sub-arrays). Each phase of a deriva-
tion is based on a sub-array of the whole.
lexical cycle
see cycle (2)
lexical density
In statistical linguistics and lexical studies, a measure
of the difﬁculty of a text, using the ratio of the number of different words
in a text (the ‘word types’) to the total number of words in the text (the
‘word tokens’); also called the type/token ratio (TTR). It is calculated by
dividing the number of different words by the total number of words and
multiplying by 100. The result is given as a percentage. The assumption is that
increasing the number of different words (i.e. a higher TTR) increases textual
difﬁculty.

lexical-functional grammar (LFG)
A linguistic theory in which the role of
the lexicon is central, and grammatical functions are taken as primitive.
The syntactic structure of a sentence consists of a constituent structure
(c-structure) and a functional structure (f-structure), which represent super-
ﬁcial grammatical relations. In this approach, the lexical component is
assigned much of the role formerly associated with the syntactic component of a
transformational grammar.

lexical noun phrase
A term used in later generative grammar to refer to a
type of noun phrase with phonological content which is of particular
importance for the theory of binding. Unlike anaphors and pronominals, lex-
ical NPs are free in all positions in the sentence; their reference is typically
independent of other NPs. A contrast can be drawn with non-lexical noun phrases
(PRO, pro, t). See empty (1).
lexical phonology (LP)
A theory of phonology in which morphological
and phonological rules are brought together within a single framework. The
approach is based on the insight that much of the phonology operates together
with the word-formation rules in a cyclic fashion to deﬁne the class of
lexical items in a language. The morphological sub-theory is ‘level-ordered’:
afﬁxes are differentiated, not by the use of boundary-markers (as in earlier
phonological theory), but by being divided into distinct subsets (numbered ‘levels’
or ‘strata’) within the lexicon, where the division of the word-formation rules
corresponds to a division among the phonological rules. The phonological
sub-theory is divided into a lexical (sometimes called a cyclic) component and
a post-lexical (sometimes called a post-cyclic) component, the latter also being
referred to as the ‘phrasal phonology’, as its rules operate across word bound-
aries, making use of syntactic structure.
lexical phrase
A type of phrase recognized in government-binding theory
for a structural conﬁguration built around a lexical head, as in the case of np
and vp. It contrasts with functional phrase.
lexical representation language
A model used in semantics to represent
basic lexical entries and characterize systematic lexical processes. A notion of
lexical representation language
277

‘types’ is used to structure lexical entries, which are represented as feature
structures (a ‘typed feature structure language’), and specify how they combine
by means of grammar rules, or constraints on phrasal types. The types are
organized in a conceptual hierarchy as a lattice framework, with the top being
the most general type and the bottom indicating inconsistency. The model is
not restricted to lexical representation (despite its name), being also used for
syntagmatic description.
lexical retrieval
see lexical access
lexical storage
A term used in psycholinguistics for the way words are
retained and made available for use by the brain during language production
and comprehension. It forms part of a theory of language processing. In
bilingualism, for example, different views exist over whether the correspond-
ing words in each language (e.g. English dog and French chien) are stored as
single or dual mental representations.
lexical stress
see stress
lexical tone
see tone (1)
lexical verb
A term used in grammar for a verb which expresses an action,
event or state; also called a full verb. The contrast is with the auxiliary verb
system, which expresses attitudinal and grammatical meanings. The ‘main verb’
of a verb phrase is always a lexical verb.
lexicography (n.)
see lexicology
lexicology (n.)
A term used in semantics for the overall study of a language’s
vocabulary (including its history). It is distinguished from lexicography, which
is the art and science of dictionary-making, carried out by lexicographers.
Lexicography could accordingly be seen as a branch of ‘applied lexicology’.
The term lexicologist is less widely used: someone interested in vocabulary
would normally be considered a species of semanticist. The psychological study
of word meaning (e.g. the linguistic expression of spatial relations) is sometimes
known as psycholexicology.
lexicon (n.)
In its most general sense, the term is synonymous with vocabu-
lary. A dictionary can be seen as a set of lexical entries. The lexicon has a
special status in generative grammar, where it refers to the component
containing all the information about the structural properties of the lexical
items in a language, i.e. their speciﬁcation semantically, syntactically and
phonologically. In later models (see aspects model), these properties are
formalized as features, and put in square brackets; e.g., word-class assign-
ments include noun [+N], etc. Given this component, the terminal symbols
in phrase-markers can then be related directly to the lexicon through the use
of lexical transformations; e.g. any item in the lexicon speciﬁed by [+D]
can be attached to the node D, and so on. The role of the lexicon became
central in lexical-functional grammar and head-driven phrase-structure
278
lexical retrieval

grammar. The mental lexicon is the stored mental representation of what we
know about the lexical items in our language.
lexicon optimization
An algorithm in optimality theory which evaluates
candidate input forms with respect to the actual output. A series of tableaux
is examined, and the input–output pair receiving the fewest constraint viola-
tions is chosen as the optimal input.
lexicostatistics (n.)
A technique used in glottochronology with which one
attempts to make quantitative comparisons between the rates of change within
sets of lexical items in hypothetically related languages, and thus to deduce
the distance in time since the languages separated. Other types of lexical com-
parison (e.g. to determine the mutual intelligibility of languages) may also be
referred to by this label.
lexis (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the vocabulary of a language,
and used adjectivally in a variety of technical phrases. A unit of vocabulary is
generally referred to as a lexical item, or lexeme. A complete inventory of the
lexical items of a language constitutes that language’s dictionary, or lexicon –
a term particularly used in generative grammar: items are listed ‘in the lex-
icon’ as a set of lexical entries. The way lexical items are organized in a language
is the lexical structure or lexical system. A group of items used to identify the
network of contrasts in a speciﬁc semantic or lexical ﬁeld (e.g. cooking, colour)
may also be called a ‘lexical system’. Speciﬁc groups of items, sharing certain
formal or semantic features, are known as lexical sets. The absence of a lexeme
at a speciﬁc structural place in a language’s lexical ﬁeld is called a lexical gap
(e.g. brother v. sister, son v. daughter, etc., but no separate lexemes for ‘male’ v.
‘female’ cousin). In comparing languages, it may be said that one language may
lexicalize a contrast, whereas another may not – that is, the contrast is identiﬁed
using lexemes, as in the many terms for the English lexeme ‘hole’ available in
some Australian Aboriginal languages. Lexis may be seen in contrast with gram-
mar, as in the distinction between ‘grammatical words’ and lexical words:
the former refers to words whose sole function is to signal grammatical relation-
ships (a role which is claimed for such words as of, to and the in English); the
latter refers to words which have lexical meaning, i.e. they have semantic con-
tent. Examples include lexical verbs (v. auxiliary verbs) and lexical noun phrases
(v. non-lexical NPs, such as PRO). A similar contrast distinguishes lexical
morphology from derivational morphology. Hallidayan linguistics makes a
theoretical distinction between grammar and lexis, seen as two subdivisions
within linguistic form: lexis here is studied with reference to such formal
concepts as collocation, and not in semantic terms. The mutual restriction
governing the co-occurrence of sets of lexical items is known as lexical
selection (e.g. animate nouns being compatible with animate verbs). Lexical
density is a measure of the difﬁculty of a text, using the ratio of the number of
different words (the ‘word types’) to the total number of words (the ‘word
tokens’): the ‘type/token ratio’.
In generative grammar, the insertion of particular lexemes at particular places
in grammatical structures is carried out by a process of lexical substitution
or lexical transformation, using lexical insertion rules. Lexical redundancy rules
lexis
279

are used to simplify the speciﬁcation of lexical entries, e.g. by omitting to
specify sub-categorization features which may be predicted on the basis of
other features. Some generative models also recognize the so-called ‘lexicalist’
hypothesis, in which a class of lexical rules governing word-formation is dis-
tinguished from the set of syntactic transformations. Essentially, the hypothesis
bans category-changing rules from the grammar – disallowing a verb or adjective
from being transformed into a noun, etc. The terms lexical syntax and lexical
phonology are also encountered in the generative literature: the former refers
to an approach which incorporates syntactic rules within the lexicon; the latter
is an approach where some of the phonological rules are transferred to
the lexicon, and integrated with the morphological component. In earlier
government-binding theory, N, V and A (but not P) were lexical categories,
as their members were proper governors. In later work, the lexical categories
are N, V, A and P, and C and I are non-lexical. See also ambiguity, cycle (2),
stress.
lexotactics (n.)
see taxis
LF-convergence
see convergence
liaison (n.)
A term used in phonology to refer to one type of transition
between sounds, where a sound is introduced at the end of a word if the
following syllable has no onset. It is a notable feature of French, e.g. the ﬁnal
t of c’est is pronounced when followed by a vowel. It may be heard in English
where a ‘linking /r/’ is often found in words ending with an r in the spelling,
when they occur before words beginning with a vowel, e.g. hear /h}v/ usually
becomes /h}vr/ in such phrases as here are.
licensed extrasyllabicity
see extrasyllabic
licensing (n.)
In government-binding theory, a notion introduced in formu-
lating conditions on representation: every element in a well-formed structure
must be licensed in one of a small number of ways. For example, an element
that assigns semantic roles is licensed if it has recipients in appropriate
syntactic positions; a syntactically deﬁned predicate is licensed if it has a
subject.
The term as used in autosegmental phonology applies to the analysis
of syllable structure. Prosodic licensing is a condition that all segments
must be part of a higher-level unit (the syllable), or else they are contingently
extrasyllabic. Autosegmental licensing presents the view that certain prosodic
units are licensers, which license a set of phonological features (autosegments).
The syllable node is a primary licenser; the coda node and certain word-ﬁnal
morphemes are secondary licensers. A given licenser can license only one occur-
rence of the autosegment in question. All autosegmental material must be licensed
at the word level; elements not licensed at this level will be deleted. The
notion of licensing has also been put to use in some other non-linear models of
phonology and in optimality theory.

light verb
In grammar, a term describing a verb whose meaning is so unspe-
ciﬁc that it needs a complement in order to function effectively as a predicate.
Examples in English include make, have and give, as used in such phrases as she
made a sign, we had a look and they gave an answer. In many cases an altern-
ative lexical verb with a more speciﬁc meaning is available, as in she signed,
we looked and they answered. The term is also used for such verbs as suru
in Japanese – a thematically incomplete verb which adds case-marking to its
complement but requires another verb in order to theta-mark it. The notion is
important in relation to the analysis of complex predication in government-
binding theory and the minimalist programme.
line (n.)
see association line
linear correspondence axiom
An axiom of generative syntax about phrase
structure, where the notion of linear order is abandoned as a grammatical
primitive; proposed by Richard Kayne (b. 1944). Instead, linear order is
derived from asymmetric c-command: when A asymmetrically c-commands B,
A precedes B.
linear grammar
A term used in computational linguistics for a type
of grammar which describes only linear or non-hierarchical aspects of
strings; also known as regular grammar. If the non-terminal symbol is the
leftmost symbol on the right-hand side of a rule, the grammar is a left-linear
grammar; if it is the rightmost, it is a right-linear grammar. For example, a
right-linear grammar has rules of the form A ⇒ aB, B ⇒ b. See also ﬁnite-
state grammar.
linearity (n.) (1)
A term used in linguistics to describe the characteristic
representation of language as a unidimensional sequence of elements or
rules. The assumption is made that it is possible to order rules in a sequence,
and to adhere strictly to this ordering in constructing derivations without any
loss of generality (compared to an unordered set of rules or a set ordered on
a different principle, e.g. one of simultaneous application). It is also claimed that
linear ordering makes it possible to formulate grammatical processes that would
otherwise not be expressible with complete generality.
(2)
In phonology, linearity is an organizational principle, whereby each occurr-
ence of a phoneme is associated with a speciﬁc sequence of phones (minimally,
one phone) which realize that phoneme. If phoneme A precedes phoneme B,
then phone(s) A′ will precede phone(s) B′. Linearity is thus one of the preconditions
of biuniqueness. The principle is criticized by generative phonologists, as part
of a general attack on taxonomic phonemics.
(3)
A family of faithfulness constraints in optimality theory which
evaluates, along with contiguity, the degree of preservation of adjacency
ordering of segments between two forms. It penalizes changes in segment
ordering between the two corresponding representations. metathesis is an
example of a phenomenon which violates linearity.

linear precedence rule (LP rule)
A type of rule in generalized phrase-
structure grammar of the form X < Y, specifying that X must precede Y.
Together with immediate dominance rules and various general principles, LP
rules generate phrase-markers.
linear prediction
A technique used in speech synthesis and speech recogni-
tion to represent acoustic phonetic knowledge in a way which is capable
of computational processing. In linear prediction coefﬁcient (LPC) synthesis, a
speech signal is deﬁned by a set of coefﬁcients (predictors), which try to predict
the signal from its past time domain values. These coefﬁcients are then used
to produce a representation of the spectrum of the signal. The approach
is based on the analysis of resonances in the vocal tract, and is thus
especially useful in its ability to identify formant locations (though sounds
involving noise features are less accurately modelled), producing syntheses of
high quality. The technique is increasingly common in spectral analysis within
phonetics.
lingua franca
A term used in sociolinguistics, and often in everyday speech,
to refer to an auxiliary language used to enable routine communication to
take place between groups of people who speak different native languages; also
sometimes called an interlingua. English is the world’s most common lingua
franca, followed by French; but other languages are also widely used. In East
Africa, for example, Swahili is the lingua franca; in many parts of West Africa,
Hausa is used.
lingual (adj.)
A general term sometimes used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of
speech sounds, referring to a sound made with the tongue. A ‘lingual roll/trill’,
for example, is the trilled [r] made with the tip of the tongue against the
alveolar ridge. The term linguo- is occasionally used as a preﬁx in the deﬁni-
tion of place of articulation (e.g. ‘linguolabial’, where the tongue would be
in contact with the lips, as in ‘blowing raspberries’), but usually more speciﬁc
preﬁxes are used (e.g. apico-, lamino-).
linguist (n.)
The normal term for a student or practitioner of the subject
of linguistics. Linguistician is often cited for this purpose, but it is never
used by professional linguists about themselves. Ironically, confusion sometimes
arises from the earlier, and still current, sense of someone proﬁcient in several
languages.
linguistic (adj.)
A term which has to be used with care because of its ambigu-
ity: it can be (1) the adjective from language, as in such phrases as ‘linguistic
philosophy’, ‘linguistic skill’ and ‘linguistic minority’, or (2) the adjective from
linguistics, where it refers to an approach characterized by the scientiﬁc
attributes of that subject, as in ‘linguistic analysis’. In such phrases as ‘linguistic
intuition’, however, either sense could apply: (a) intuitions about language,
or (b) ‘intuitions about how to analyse language linguistically’. Similarly, a
‘linguistic atlas’ may or may not be based on the techniques, ﬁndings, etc., of
linguistics.
282
linear precedence rule

linguistically signiﬁcant generalization
A term used especially in generative
grammar to refer to the kind of analytic statement which it is hoped the
grammatical analysis will provide. The aim of the grammar is not just to generate
all and only the grammatical sentences of a language, but to do this in such
a way that those relationships felt to be signiﬁcant by native-speakers are
expressed in an economical and general way. For example, a grammar which
generated active sentences separately from passive ones, or questions from
statements, and which failed to show these are interrelated, would be missing
linguistically signiﬁcant generalizations. This was one of the reasons for the
introduction of transformations into linguistic analysis. The extent to which
a grammar expresses the linguistically signiﬁcant generalizations about a language
would be one measure of the grammar’s adequacy.

linguistic historiography
The study of the history of ideas in linguistics and
language study. The subject traces the origins of thinking about language from
Classical times, using Greek, Roman, Indian, Arabic and other sources, continuing
with the various schools of thought in the Middle Ages and the emergence of
‘traditional’ accounts of pronunciation, spelling, grammar, lexicography and
usage, down to the antecedents of present-day scientiﬁc and popular views of
language and languages. All languages are in principle included, though most
work has been carried out on European languages, where historical records are
most in evidence. The subject also includes debate on the methodological and
philosophical foundations of historiography, including its relationship to the
history and philosophy of science.

linguistics (n.)
The scientiﬁc study of language; also called linguistic science.
As an academic discipline, the development of this subject has been relatively
linguistics
283

recent and rapid, having become particularly widely known and taught in the
1960s. This reﬂects partly an increased popular and specialist interest in the
study of language and communication in relation to human beliefs and beha-
viour (e.g. in theology, philosophy, information theory, literary criticism), and
the realization of the need for a separate discipline to deal adequately with the
range and complexity of linguistic phenomena; partly the impact of the subject’s
own internal development at this time, arising largely out of the work of the
American linguist Noam Chomsky and his associates (see Chomskyan), whose
more sophisticated analytic techniques and more powerful theoretical claims
gave linguistics an unprecedented scope and applicability.
Different branches may be distinguished according to the linguist’s focus and
range of interest (and each is dealt with in separate entries in this book). A
major distinction, introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure (see Saussurean), is
between diachronic and synchronic linguistics, the former referring to the study
of language change (also called historical linguistics), the latter to the study of
the state of language at any given point in time. In so far as the subject attempts
to establish general principles for the study of all languages, and to determine
the characteristics of human language as a phenomenon, it may be called
general linguistics (see general) or theoretical linguistics. When it concentrates
on establishing the facts of a particular language system, it is called descriptive
linguistics (see description). When its purpose is to focus on the differences
between languages, especially in a language-teaching context, it is called
contrastive linguistics (see contrastive (2)). When its purpose is primarily to
identify the common characteristics of different languages or language families,
the subject goes under the heading of comparative (or typological) linguistics
(see comparative (1)).
When the emphasis in linguistics is wholly or largely historical, the subject is
traditionally referred to as comparative philology (or simply philology),
though in many parts of the world ‘philologists’ and ‘historical linguists’
are people with very different backgrounds and attitudes. The term structural
linguistics is widely used (see structural), sometimes in an extremely speciﬁc
sense, referring to the particular approaches to syntax and phonology current
in the 1940s and 1950s, with their emphasis on providing discovery pro-
cedures for the analysis of a language’s surface structure; sometimes in a
more general sense, referring to any system of linguistic analysis that attempts
to establish explicit systems of relations between linguistic units in surface
structure. When the emphasis in language study is on the classiﬁcation of
structures and units, without reference to such notions as deep structure,
some linguists, particularly within generative grammar, talk pejoratively of
taxonomic linguistics.
In the later twentieth century the term linguistic sciences came to be used by
many as a single label for both linguistics and phonetics – the latter being
considered here as a strictly pre-language study. Equally, there are many who do
not see the divide between linguistics and phonetics being as great as this label
suggests: they would be quite happy to characterize the subject as linguistic
science. ‘Linguistics’ is still the preferred name.
The overlapping interest of linguistics and other disciplines has led to the set-
ting up of new branches of the subject in both pure and applied contexts, such
as anthropological linguistics, biolinguistics, clinical linguistics, computational
284
linguistics

linguistics, critical linguistics, developmental linguistics, ecolinguistics, educational
linguistics, ethnolinguistics, forensic linguistics, geographical linguistics, institu-
tional linguistics, mathematical linguistics, neurolinguistics, peace linguistics,
philosophical linguistics, psycholinguistics, quantitative linguistics, sociolinguistics,
statistical linguistics, theolinguistics (see individual entries). When the subject’s
ﬁndings, methods, or theoretical principles are applied to the study of problems
from other areas of experience, one talks of applied linguistics; but this term is
often restricted to the study of the theory and methodology of foreign-language
teaching.

linking (adj./n.) (1)
A term used in phonology to refer to a sound which is
introduced between linguistic units, usually for ease of pronunciation. In
English, the linking r is the most familiar example of this process, as when the r
in car is pronounced before a vowel, or when an /r/ is introduced without there
being justiﬁcation in the writing (e.g. Shah of . . . /àwprvv . . . /). In French, a
linking /t/ is introduced in the third-person question form of verbs, when this
ends in a vowel, e.g. il a ‘he has’ ⇒ a-t-il. In syntax, the copula be, and
sometimes such verbs as seem, become, etc., may be referred to as linking verbs.
(2)
In models of non-linear phonology, a formal means of relating units
(nodes, features, particles, etc.) within a hierarchical representation; the
disassociation of a unit from a segment is called delinking. A delinked unit
occurs on a tier on its own. Units which are linked to more than one segment
(as in the various kinds of assimilation, or in certain kinds of gemination)
are said to show multiple linking (or be multilinked). Various conditions have
been proposed to ensure the well-formedness of association lines in struc-
tural descriptions, such as the linking constraint, which requires that all
association lines be interpreted exhaustively.
(3)
A family of constraints in optimality theory, usually referred to as Link,
requiring that a feature be associated to a consonant or a vowel, whether
or not the association is part of the lexical input. For example, in a tone
language, Link[Tone] would associate a tone with a vowel.

A term occasionally used in psycholinguistics for the notion of
a word or other expression as a member of a list of linguistic entities stored in
the brain.
literacy (n.)
The ability to read and write; it contrasts with illiteracy, the two
poles now being seen to demarcate a continuum of ability. Discussion of the
problem, either within a country or on a world scale, is complicated by the
difﬁculty of measuring the extent of literacy in individuals. The notion of func-
tional literacy was introduced in the 1940s, in an attempt to identify minimal
levels of reading/writing efﬁciency in a society, such as being able to write one’s
name; but deﬁning even minimal levels is difﬁcult, especially today, with increas-
ing demands being made on people to be literate in a wider range of contexts.
National literacy campaigns in several countries have raised public awareness,
and standards are slowly rising. Biliteracy is the ability to read and write in
more than one language. The term ‘literacy’ is also now often used in a broader
sense, referring to the ability to understand a technical or cultural domain, as in
computer literacy and graphic literacy.

little v
In the minimalist programme, a term which describes the head of the
outer projection in the vp-shell. It is written with a lower-case v. The little v
hypothesis asserts that external thematic roles (e.g. agent) are not assigned
directly by their verb but rather by a light verb acting as a secondary predicate.
l-marking (n.)
A term used in later government-binding theory, distin-
guishing a category which is the complement of a V, N, A or P (l-marked)
from one which is the complement of C or I. The symbol ‘l’ derives from ‘lexical
category’.
loan (n.)
A linguistic unit (usually a lexical item) which has come to be
used in a language or dialect other than the one where it originated. Several
types of loan process have been recognized, such as loan words (where both
form and meaning are borrowed, or ‘assimilated’, with some adaptation to the
phonological system of the new language, e.g. sputnik); loan blends (where
the meaning is borrowed, but only part of the form, e.g. restaurant with a
simulated French ending /crestvr\/; loan shifts (where the meaning is borrowed,
and the form is native, e.g. restaurant as /crestrvnt/); and loan translations
(where the morphemes in the borrowed word are translated item by item, e.g.
286
lip-rounding

superman from Übermensch – also known as a calque). The study of how
languages adapt foreign words within their phonological systems is known as
loan phonology.
local (adj.)
A type of transformation, introduced by Noam Chomsky (in
Aspects of the Theory of Syntax), which affects only a substring dominated
by a single category symbol: the applicability of the rule is thus determined
by the phrase structure of the string, not just by the sequence of elementary
symbols of which the string is composed. For example, the way in which the
rules of the transformational cycle in phonology are applied to assign stress
depends on the way the formatives are categorized, e.g. as noun, verb,
adjective, etc., in the phrase-structure tree. See also locality.
localism (n.)
An approach to linguistic analysis which proposes that expres-
sions of location (in space and time) are more basic to a grammatical or
semantic analysis than are other types of expressions, which are viewed as
derived. In this localist view, distinctions such as tense, aspect, possession and
existence are interpreted as having underlying locational features, as is most
evident in such relations as John has a dog/John’s dog . . . , and there are four
legs on that table/that table has four legs.
locality (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology, especially in some non-linear
models, to refer to the domain of application of a rule. In one formulation,
the locality condition states that phonological rules apply between elements
adjacent on a given tier. Non-linear phonology is especially interested in
locality because its ability to handle non-adjacent segments (as in vowel har-
mony) is one of its chief claims. Non-linear principles enable long-distance
rules to operate between segments which are adjacent at a particular level of
representation, even though the segments are not adjacent at all levels. Local-
ity theory develops this approach into a general theory of phonological adja-
cency requirements. It is deﬁned by a universal locality condition, which requires
elements to be local within a plane (the ‘adjacency parameter’, which then
allows rules to impose further constraints on the maximal distance between
interacting segments) and by a principle of transplanar locality (which bans
certain types of relations across featural planes).
(2)
In generative syntax, a term used to refer to a set of syntactic principles
that constrain derivations or representations in some local way. For
example, when a category moves, it can move only within a certain domain
(as in subjacency). Anaphors must appear in close proximity to their ante-
cedents. See binding.
local tree
see tree (1)
location (n.)
see hold (2)
locative (adj./n.) (loc, LOC)
In languages which express grammatical rela-
tionships by means of inﬂections, this term refers to the form taken by a
noun phrase (often a single noun or pronoun), when it typically expresses
the idea of location of an entity or action. English does not have a locative
locative
287

case form (‘a locative’), using such prepositions as at instead. Structures
which express locational meaning may also be referred to as locative, e.g. in
The woman was standing at a bus stop, at a bus stop could be called a ‘locative
phrase’. Some linguists see locative constructions as having particular
importance in developing a linguistic theory, interpreting such notions as
‘being’, ‘having’, etc., as involving a fundamental locative feature. The term is
also given special status in case grammar. See semantic role.
locus (n.)
A term used in acoustic phonetics to refer to the apparent point
of origin of a formant for a given place of articulation, as displayed on a
spectrogram. The formants which identify vowels are bent in characteristic
directions, depending on the consonants adjacent to them; but for any single
consonant these bends, or transitions, all point in the same direction, at a
hypothetical natural frequency range for the consonant. It is this hypothetical
point of origin which is referred to as the locus (or, in later work, locus space)
of the consonant. A locus equation is based on the onset frequency of the
second formant and the steady-state value of that formant during the vowel in
a consonant–vowel sequence. A linear regression is performed on these two
variables for productions of the same consonant in different vowel contexts. The
slope of the locus equation can be associated with the degree of coarticulation
between the consonant and the vowel: a slope of 1 indicates maximum coar-
ticulation (i.e. the onset and target frequencies of the second formant would be
identical); a slope of 0 indicates no coarticulation.
locutionary (adj.)
A term used in the theory of speech acts to refer to an act
of making a meaningful utterance. The point of the term is in its contrast
with illocutionary and perlocutionary acts, where there is more involved
than merely ‘speaking’.
logical consequence
A term used in formal logic, and often encountered in
semantic theory, for the relation between the premises of a valid argument
and its conclusion. A proposition p is a logical consequence of a proposition
q if and only if there is a valid argument with q as its premise and p as its
conclusion. The term is often understood to encompass only those cases where
the argument is valid by virtue of to its general form, hence excluding examples
of entailment in which the meaning of non-logical constants plays a
crucial role.
logical constant
A term used in formal logic, and often encountered in semantic
theory, for those lexical items which are considered part of the general form
of an argument. The exact deﬁnition and membership of the set of logical
constants is a matter of some debate, but it is typically understood to include
at least the truth functional connectives and quantiﬁers. In model-
theoretic semantics, logical constants are those expressions whose semantic
value does not vary from model to model.
logical form (LF)
A term used in a variety of semantic, syntactic and logical
theories for a level of representation relevant to semantic interpretation,
especially to those aspects of interpretation which play a role in determining
288
locus

entailment and other logical relations. In the principles and parameters
approach, it refers to the interface between the syntactic and semantic com-
ponents; LF contains such information as focus, quantiﬁcation, and the-
matic structure. In government-binding theory, LF is a representation that
derives from S-structure by applying movement operations (move alpha)
similar to the one that derives S-structure from D-structure. In the minimalist
programme, LF is the representation that derives from numeration by applying
merge and move. LF as a level of representation has been questioned in some
recent minimalist thinking.
logical truth
A term used in logic, and often in semantic theory, for truth
which is guaranteed by the principles of logic. This is usually understood to
encompass only those sentences which are true by virtue of their general form.
logocentrism (n.)
In literary stylistics, a term referring to a language- or
word-centred view of literature or other behaviour. The notion is associated
with the structuralist approach to analysis, which focused on the study of the
language of a text to the exclusion of the author’s individuality, the social
context, and the historical situation. A reaction to this logocentric view in the
late 1960s came to be called post-structuralism. Here, language is seen as a
system whose value shifts in response to non-linguistic factors. A range of
viewpoints drew attention to the multiple meanings of words, stressing the role
of mental processes in interpreting linguistic relationships, and denying the
possibility of objectivity in textual interpretation. In particular, the methods of
deconstruction, developed by Jacques Derrida (1930–2004), aimed to show the
inherent contradictions and paradoxes in logocentric approaches.
logogram (n.)
In the study of writing systems, a written or printed symbol
which represents a word (or morpheme) in a language; also called a logograph
or (in the case of Oriental languages) a character. The best-known examples of
a logographic system are Chinese and its derivative script, Japanese kanji. The
term must be used with care, as it suggests that only words are represented by
the symbols, whereas meaningful parts of words (e.g. afﬁxes, roots) are also
included in the notion. Logograms in European languages include the numerals
(1, 2, etc.) and many mathematical and scientiﬁc symbols.

longitudinal (adj.)
An application of the general use of this term in the ﬁeld of
child language acquisition, referring to one of the two main procedures used
in order to study the process of language development. A longitudinal study
longitudinal
289

follows the course of language acquisition in a single child or group over a
period of time. This method contrasts with a cross-sectional study, where the
language of a group of children of the same or different ages is compared at a
given point in time. The terms are also encountered in several other domains of
linguistic enquiry, such as sociolinguistics.
loopback
A term in tagmemic grammar for the inclusion of a higher-level
construction within the slots of a lower-level construction, as in the use of
relative clauses within the noun phrase (e.g. the girl who was talking . . . );
also called backlooping. It is distinguished from level-skipping and layering.
loss (n.)
see language death, language loss
loudness (n.)
The attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which a sound
may be ordered on a scale from soft to loud. It is an auditory phonetic
feature, corresponding to some degree with the acoustic features of intensity
or power (measured in decibels (dB)), which in the study of speech is based on
the size of the vibrations of the vocal folds, as a result of variations in air
pressure. There is, however, no direct or parallel correlation between loud-
ness (or ‘volume’) and intensity: other factors than intensity may affect our
sensation of loudness; e.g. increasing the frequency of vocal-fold vibrations
may make one sound seem louder than another. The linguistic use of loudness
is of particular interest to the phonologist, and this is studied under the
heading of stress.
low (adj.) (1)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle (see
Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to handle
variations in place of articulation (cavity features). Low sounds are a type
of tongue-body feature, and deﬁned articulatorily, as those produced by
lowering the tongue to below the level it holds in neutral position; open
vowels and the glottal fricatives are [+low]. Its opposite is non-low [−low]
or high, referring to sounds produced without any such lowering; it thus covers
mid and close vowels, and most consonants.
(2)
Low describes the less formal variety in diglossia; opposed to ‘high’.
lower category
A term used in generative grammar to refer to a category
which has already been used in a tree-diagram representation. The category
that has been introduced later will appear to be lower down the tree than the
earlier (higher) category. Lower, or embedded, sentences (clauses, verb
phrases, noun phrases, etc.) can be illustrated by the car which I left in the
street has been stolen. It has occasionally been suggested that there are no
lowering transformations, but lowering operations were assumed in later
government-binding theory.

ludic (adj.)
A term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to language whose
primary function is to be part of play, as in the nonsense, repetitive rhythms,
and rhymes heard in children’s games all over the world. Ludicity also affects
adults, who may play with language by adopting silly tones of voice or by
twisting words into unorthodox shapes to create a humorous effect (see ludling,
verbal play).
ludling (n.)
A term used in an approach to the formal deﬁnition of language
games (e.g. play languages, speech disguises, secret languages); from Latin ludus
(‘play’) + lingua (‘language’). The focus is on the distinctive structure such
games display. In particular, their morphological system is limited to a small
number of operations superimposed on ordinary language (e.g. inﬁxation,
syllable reversal), its afﬁxes are very few (often only one), and the added
elements have no meaning. Ludling operations are seen as extensions of ordinary
language processes (see restricted language), and their study has proved
attractive in non-linear approaches to phonology and morphology, where
they are often referred to as part of the evidence supporting a particular theoretical
construct (e.g. the notion of a skeletal tier).

M
macrolinguistics (n.)
A term used by some linguists, especially in the 1950s, to
identify an extremely broad conception of the subject of linguistic enquiry. In a
macrolinguistic approach, linguistics is seen in its overall relation to phonetic
and extralinguistic experience. It is divided into three main subﬁelds: pre-
linguistics (whose primary subject-matter is phonetics), microlinguistics
(whose primary subject-matter is phonology, morphology and syntax) and
metalinguistics (whose subject-matter is the relationship between language
and all extralinguistic features of communicative behaviour, e.g. including what
would now be called sociolinguistics). Some sociolinguists (e.g. Joshua Fishman
(b. 1926)) distinguish between the broad concerns of macrosociolinguistics
(e.g. multilingualism, language planning) and the detailed investigation of
microsociolinguistics (e.g. speech events, conversations).
macroparadigm (n.)
A term sometimes used in morphology for a set of para-
digms whose differences can be explained with reference to formal criteria. An
example would be a pair of paradigms where the phonological differences in
the sufﬁxes could be explained by showing that they are related through vowel
harmony (as in Hungarian and Turkish).

macro-role

macrosociolinguistics (n.)

main (adj.)
A term used in grammatical analysis as part of the classiﬁca-
tion of clause types; opposed to subordinate or dependent. A main clause
is an independent clause, i.e. it can stand on its own as a sentence. The term is
also used to identify the more important structural member of a sequence of
items all belonging to the same class, e.g. ‘main verb’ (v. auxiliary verb).
maintenance (n.)
see language maintenance
major (adj.) (1)
A term used by some linguists in the classiﬁcation of
sentence types to refer to the most productive sentence patterns in a language.
A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics 6th Edition.  David Crystal
© 2008 David Crystal.  ISBN: 978-1-405-15296-9

In English, the subject+predicate (NP+VP) pattern is the major (or favour-
ite) sentence type, e.g. The elephant is running, A book is on the table. Other
types may be referred to as minor.
(2)
In some models of feature geometry, a term which forms part of a binary
phonological distinction corresponding to the phonetic contrast between
primary and secondary articulation; opposed to minor. It is argued that,
in consonants involving multiple articulations, only one degree of closure
is distinctive (the ‘major articulator’); the other is predictable (the ‘minor
articulator’), and thus its degree of closure need not be speciﬁed in the phono-
logical representation.
major class feature
One of the ﬁve main dimensions of classiﬁcation in Chomsky
and Halle’s distinctive feature theory of phonology (the others being cav-
ity features, manner-of-articulation features, source features and prosodic
features). The term refers to the main types of sound produced by the open v.
closed possibilities of vocal tract variation. There are three such features, all
deﬁned as oppositions: sonorant v. non-sonorant (obstruent), vocalic v.
non-vocalic, and consonantal v. non-consonantal. Using these features, sounds
can be subdivided into the major classes of vowels, consonants, obstruents,
sonorants, glides and liquids. See Chomskyan.
mandibular setting
see jaw setting
manifestation (n.)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the physical ex-
pression of an abstract linguistic unit; e.g. phonemes are manifested in phonic
substance as phones, morphemes as morphs. Any underlying form may be
seen as having a corresponding manifestation in substance. In tagmemics, the
term has a special status, referring to the etic (physical) expression of emic
(abstract) units (the manifestation mode). Elsewhere, the term realization is
widely used.
manner (n.) (1)
One of the main parameters in the phonetic or phonolo-
gical classiﬁcation of speech sounds, referring to the kind of articulatory
process used in a sound’s production. The distinction between consonant and
vowel is usually made in terms of manner of articulation. Within consonants,
several articulatory types are recognized, based on the type of closure made by
the vocal organs. If the closure is complete, the result is a plosive, affricate
or nasal. If the closure is partial, the result is a lateral. If the closure is
intermittent, the result is a roll (trill) or ﬂap. And if there is narrowing
without complete closure the result is a fricative. Within vowels, classiﬁca-
tion is based on the number of auditory qualities distinguishable in the sound
(pure vowel, diphthong, triphthong), the position of the soft palate, and
the type of lip position (see rounding). Sounds which are vowel-like in manner
of articulation, but consonantal in function, are classiﬁed as semivowels or
frictionless continuants.
The term has special status in distinctive feature theory in phonology,
where it constitutes one of the ﬁve main dimensions in terms of which features
of speech sound are analysed (the others being major class features, cavity
manner
293

features, source features and prosodic features). The features subsumed under
this heading, all analysed as oppositions, are: continuant, release features
(instantaneous and delayed), supplementary movements (suction and
pressure) and tense.
(2)
Several linguists use this term in the classiﬁcation of language varieties
(more fully, manner of discourse), referring to the relations among the parti-
cipants in a language activity, especially the level of formality they adopt
(colloquial, formal, etc.). Alternative labels which have been proposed for this
area are style or tenor of discourse.
manner adverb(ial)
A common term in grammatical description, referring to
an adverb or adverbial able to answer the question ‘how?’, e.g. in an impos-
ing manner, in a nice way, quickly, angrily. Certain other semantic classes of
adverbial are closely related (e.g. instrument, means), and sometimes subsumed
under the heading of manner. Some generative linguists see adverbials of
manner as particularly signiﬁcant, proposing a relationship between them and
the passive construction.
manner maxim
A term identifying one of the maxims of conversation: the
‘maxim of manner’ states that a person’s contribution to a conversation should
ideally be perspicuous – for example, avoiding obscurity and ambiguity.
manner of discourse
see manner (2)
map (v.)
see mapping
mapping (n.)
This term, used to characterize a feature of model construc-
tion in scientiﬁc enquiry, has been applied in several areas of linguistics and
phonetics. Mapping refers to the correspondence between the elements
deﬁned in a model of a situation, and the elements recognized in the situation
itself. If these elements are in a one-to-one correspondence, at a given level of
abstraction, then the mapping is said to be isomorphic; if there is a superﬁcial
or selective correspondence (again, at a given level of abstraction), the map-
ping is ‘homomorphic’. For example, one could evaluate the extent to which
an isomorphic relationship existed between syntactic and semantic levels of
representation of sentence structure. In transformational grammar,
the term is used speciﬁcally to refer to the process whereby a particular stage
in the derivation of a sentence is formally related to a subsequent stage, e.g.
an input phrase is mapped by a set of transformations on to a derived
phrase-marker.
marginal auxiliary

marginally acceptable
see acceptability
margins (n.)
The collective term for the sound segments which form the
boundaries of a syllable centre (nucleus). In the word cup, for example,
the consonants [k] and [p] constitute the syllable margins, as opposed to the
vowel, which constitutes the syllable centre. See also edge.
294
manner adverb(ial)

markedness (n.)
An analytic principle in linguistics whereby pairs of linguistic
features, seen as oppositions, are given different values of positive (marked)
and neutral or negative (unmarked). In its most general sense, this distinction
refers to the presence versus the absence of a particular linguistic feature. There
is a formal feature marking plural in most English nouns, for example; the
plural is therefore ‘marked’, and the singular is ‘unmarked’. The reason for pos-
tulating such a relationship becomes clear when one considers the alternative,
which would be to say that the opposed features simply operate in parallel,
lacking any directionality. Intuitively, however, one prefers an analysis whereby
dogs is derived from dog rather than the other way round – in other words,
to say that ‘dogs is the plural of dog’, rather than ‘dog is the singular of dogs’.
Most of the theoretical discussion of markedness, then, centres on the question
of how far there is intuitive justiﬁcation for applying this notion to other areas
of language (cf. prince/princess, happy/unhappy, walk/walked, etc.).
One of the earliest uses of the notion was in Prague School phonology,
where a sound would be said to be marked if it possessed a certain distinctive
feature (e.g. voice), and unmarked it if lacked it (this unmarked member
being the one which would be used in cases of neutralization). In generat-
ive phonology, the notion developed into a central criterion for formalizing the
relative naturalness of alternative solutions to phonological problems. Here,
evidence from frequency of occurrence, historical linguistics and language
acquisition is used to support the view that marking is a basic principle for
assigning universal (and possibly innate) values to phonetic features (by con-
trast with the language-speciﬁc, phonological approach of the Prague School).
The distinctive features are each assigned marking values, e.g. [+voice] is seen as
marked, [−voice] as unmarked. segments, in this view, can then be seen as
combinations of marked or unmarked features, and thus be compared with each
other, e.g. /a/ is the maximally unmarked vowel because it is [−high], [−back]
and [−round]; /Ñ/ is more complex because it is [+low] and [+round], and so on.
In later phonological theory (e.g. in underspeciﬁcation theory), the notion
of markedness took on a critical status. Based on the view that the unmarked
value of a feature is the normal, neutral state of the relevant articulator, some
approaches assert that only one value need be present in the underlying
representation; the other can be predicted by a context-free rule which
mirrors the relevant markedness statement. For example, [ ] ⇒ [−nasal] would
represent the notion that segments are normally oral. The rule would insert
[−nasal] by default only in segments lacking a nasal value. Such rules are known
as ‘markedness-based context-free redundancy rules’.
Several other interpretations of the notion of marking are found in the liter-
ature, where the concept of ‘presence v. absence’ does not readily apply. One
interpretation relates marking to frequency of occurrence, as when one might
say a falling intonation pattern was unmarked, compared with a rising one,
because it is more common. Another is found in the semantic analysis of lexical
items, where pairs of items are seen as unmarked and marked respectively, on
the grounds that one member is more speciﬁc than the other (e.g. dog/bitch,
where the latter is marked for sex – one can say male/female dog, but these
adjectives are inapplicable with bitch). A third, related sense occurs when the
distribution of one member of an opposition is restricted, compared with the
other: the restricted item is then said to be marked – several comparative
markedness
295

sentences illustrate this, e.g. How tall is John? (where How short is John? is
abnormal). In later generative linguistics, a more general theory of marked-
ness emerged. Here, an unmarked property is one which accords with the
general tendencies found in all languages; a marked property is one which goes
against these general tendencies – in other words, it is exceptional (a relative
universal). Markedness in this sense can be represented as a continuum along
which language-universal and language-speciﬁc properties can be related. A highly
unmarked property is one which makes a strong claim to universal status; a
highly marked property is one which makes a weak universal claim. A universal
which is strongly represented in a particular language makes that language
highly unmarked in that respect, and vice versa. For example, in relation to the
proposed phonological universal that words must start with a consonant+vowel
structure (CV), some languages (e.g. Yawelmani) totally satisfy this universal,
whereas others (e.g. English) do not; English is therefore more marked than
Yawelmani, in this respect. In optimality theory, the ranking of constraints
and constraint violations allows the notion of markedness to be encoded
directly into the model.
marker (n.) (1)
A term used in early generative linguistics as part of a
(controversial) two-way classiﬁcation of the semantic components of lexical
items. Markers are those components of the meaning of a lexical item which
are systematic for the language, i.e. the relations into which the item enters are
systematic, in that the analysis of other lexical items makes reference to them.
For example, [animate] is a marker, as can be seen by selectional restrictions
on the co-occurrence of [+animate] lexical items with [−animate] ones, e.g.
*the stone slept. Components of meaning which do not operate in this way are
called distinguishers.
(2)
In sociolinguistics, marker refers to a linguistic variable which conveys
social import, people being aware of the distinction and associating it with
groups within the speech community. An example is the contrast between short
and long a in British English, in such words as bath. William Labov (b. 1927)
distinguishes markers from indicators and stereotypes.
Markov process
A term introduced into linguistics by Noam Chomsky in Syn-
tactic Structures referring to the mathematical characterization of a ﬁnite-state
grammar. A. A. Markov (1856–1922) was a Russian mathematician who helped
to develop the theory of stochastic processes, introducing the notion of chained
events (a Markov chain). See also automaton, hidden Markov model.
masculine (adj.)
see gender
mass (adj.)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of nouns; opposed to
count. The term refers to those nouns which the speaker treats as continuous
entities, having no natural bounds (contrasting with the separable ‘countable’
quality of count nouns); but the distinction is not made on semantic grounds
alone; the contrasting pattern of co-occurrence with determiners, quanti-
ﬁers, etc., is the main evidence, e.g. *an anger v. some anger shows this to be
a mass noun. There is no logical reason why nouns should be count or mass:
296
marker

a concept may be countable in one language, but mass in another, as in the case
of information, which is mass in English (in modern times), but countable in
French (des informations).
matched guise
A technique used in sociolinguistics to obtain informa-
tion about unconsciously held language attitudes. The output of one person
capable of speaking in two ‘guises’ (authentically sounding alternative accents,
dialects or languages) is presented to listeners who rate the speech in terms
of such scales as intellectual capability and social solidarity. Because other vari-
ables (such as subject-matter) can be kept constant, the technique offers a larger
measure of experimental control than is usual in sociolinguistic research.
matching (n.)
A term used in government-binding theory as a condition
required by the (sub-)theory of binding. The matching condition states that, if
two noun phrases are assigned the same indices, their features (of number,
gender, etc.) must be compatible.
material biconditional
see material conditional
material conditional
A sentential connective, standardly used in propositional
calculus, and sometimes employed in the semantic analysis of conditional
and certain quantiﬁcational sentences. A sentence consisting of two clauses
linked by this connective is true if the antecedent is false or the consequ-
ent is true; and is false otherwise. The material biconditional is a related
connective: a sentence consisting of two clauses connected by the material
biconditional is true if the two clauses are identical in truth value, and false
otherwise.
mathematical linguistics
A branch of linguistics which studies the mathematical
properties of language, usually employing concepts of a statistical or algebraic
kind. A contribution has also come from information theory (e.g. quantiﬁcation
of such notions as redundancy and functional load) and from computa-
tional analysis (e.g. the use of algorithms). The main application of math-
ematical notions has been in the formalization of linguistic theory, as developed
in relation to generative linguistics; but several other areas of language study
have been investigated using these methods. Statistical studies of the distribu-
tion and frequency of linguistic items have led to the development of several
empirical laws and speciﬁc techniques, e.g. in authorship studies (see stylostatistics
in stylistics) and comparative language study (see lexicostatistics).
matrix (n.) (1)
A term derived from mathematics to refer to a rectangular
array of entities (usually symbols) made up of rows and columns, and used in all
branches of linguistics as an aid in description or analysis. In phonology,
for example, distinctive features are usually described within a matrix, where
the columns are segments and the rows are features: the cells of the matrix are
then ﬁlled with pluses or minuses (or, in some cases, zero) corresponding to
whether a feature is or is not used.
(2)
A term used in linguistics, and especially in generative grammar, to refer
to the superordinate sentence within which another sentence is embedded, e.g.

maximality (n.) (MAX)
A family of faithfulness constraints in optimality
theory requiring that every feature or segment in the input has an identical
correspondent in the output. deletion is an example of a phenomenon which
violates maximality. See also dependence.

maxims of conversation
A term derived from the work of the philosopher H. P.
Grice (1913–88), and now widely cited in pragmatics research. The maxims
are general principles which are thought to underlie the efﬁcient use of language,
and which together identify a general co-operative principle. Four basic
maxims are recognized. The maxim of quality states that speakers’ contributions
ought to be true – speciﬁcally, that they should not say what they believe to be
false, nor should they say anything for which they lack adequate evidence. The
maxim of quantity states that the contribution should be as informative as is
required for the current purposes of the exchange, and should not be unneces-
sarily informative. The maxim of relevance states that contributions should be
relevant to the purpose of the exchange. The maxim of manner states that the
contribution should be perspicuous – in particular, that it should be orderly and
brief, avoiding obscurity and ambiguity. The ideas underlying the maxims
have since been developed within relevance theory.

meaning (n.)
The basic notion is used in linguistics both as a datum and as a
criterion of analysis: linguists study meaning, and also use meaning as a criterion
for studying other aspects of language (especially through such notions as
contrastivity and distinctiveness). The topic of ‘meaning’ in the context of
language, however, necessitates reference to non-linguistic factors, such as thought,
situation, knowledge, intention and use. It is the difﬁculty in drawing clear
dividing-lines between such notions that indicates why so many other academic
practitioners are involved in the study of meaning along with linguistics –
philosophers and logicians especially, but also psychologists, sociologists,
literary critics, theologians and others. Linguists’ primary interests are distin-
guished by the attention they pay to the analysis of meaning (meaningfulness,
meaninglessness) in the context of everyday speech (rather than, say, in the
context of literature, or abstract reasoning), by their comparative interests (com-
paring the way meaning is structured in a range of languages, and how meaning
changes over time), and by their attempt to integrate meaning with the other
components of a general linguistic theory (especially with grammar). These
emphases characterize the linguistic study of meaning, semantics. There was
298
maximal-command

continuing debate, in the later decades of the twentieth century (especially in
generative grammar), about the place of semantics in relation to syntax,
when considering the derivation of sentences.
Linguistics shares with other disciplines the concern to isolate the several factors
which contribute to the total interpretation, or signiﬁcation, of a message, as
this provides the essential perspective within which the speciﬁcally intralinguistic
properties of meaning can be identiﬁed. These factors – the ‘meanings of mean-
ing’ as they are sometimes called – have been variously labelled; and, while it is
impossible to generalize about usage (in view of the many technical senses these
labels have in various theories), labels do cluster around three major themes.
When the emphasis is on the relationship between language, on the one hand, and
the entities, events, states of affairs, etc., which are external to speakers and their
language, on the other, terms such as ‘referential/descriptive/denotative/
extensional/factual/objective meaning’ have been used. When the emphasis
is on the relationship between language and the mental state of the speaker,
two sets of terms are used: the personal, emotional aspects are handled by such
terms as ‘attitudinal/affective/connotative/emotive/expressive meaning’;
the intellectual, factual aspects involve such terms as ‘cognitive/ideational
meaning’. When the emphasis is on the way variations in the extralinguistic
situation affect the understanding and interpretation of language, terms such as
‘contextual/functional/interpersonal/social/situational’ have been used.
‘Contextual’, along with ‘textual meaning’, is also used to refer to those factors
which affect the interpretation of a sentence which derive from the rest of the
discourse or text within which the sentence occurs. Within linguistics, the role
each linguistic level plays in the total interpretation of a sentence is often
referred to as the ‘meaning’ of that level. The main levels involved are lexical
meaning, the meaning of lexical items; and grammatical meaning (or struc-
tural meaning), the meaning of grammatical structures. This approach has been
extended by some linguists (e.g. Firthians) to include other linguistic levels,
e.g. phonetic meaning (see sound-symbolism), phonological meaning (as in the
structural use of alliteration or rhyme in poetry). The term semantic meaning
may be used whenever one wants to emphasize the content, as opposed to the
form or reference, of linguistic units. Speciﬁc aspects of the content of sentences
may be singled out for special attention, e.g. the notion of ‘propositional
meaning’. A meaning postulate is a notion used in model-theoretic sem-
antics which restricts the possible interpretations of an object language (L)
by describing lexical meanings in terms of analytically true sentences in L
(see postulate).
meaning-changing/meaning-preserving
A theoretical distinction introduced in
early generative grammar between two types of transformations. If the
operation of a transformation involves a change in the meaning between input
and derived sentences, the transformation is said to be ‘meaning-changing’; in
‘meaning-preserving’ transformations, there is no such change (see Katz–Postal
hypothesis). An example of the former would be in deriving imperative
sentences from an underlying (declarative) structure by using a you-
deletion transformation (e.g. see from you see); here is a plain contrast between
declarative and imperative ‘meanings’, and the reason for the appearance of this
contrast in the grammar is the use of the transformation. On the other hand, if
meaning-changing/meaning-preserving
299

the imperative is derived from an underlying structure where its ‘imperativeness’
has been represented, then the application of the you-deletion transformation
would no longer change the structure’s meaning, but simply make tangible an
element of meaning which was already present (viz. Imp. + see ⇒ see). Other
examples of meaning-changing transformations include negative placement
(e.g. Not much shrapnel hit the soldier v. Much shrapnel did not hit the soldier)
and subject raising (e.g. It is certain that nobody will pass the test v. Nobody is
certain to pass the test).

mean length of utterance (MLU)
A measure introduced by the American psy-
chologist Roger Brown (1925–1997) into language acquisition studies in the
1960s, which computes the length of an utterance in terms of morphemes.
The technique is then used to show the increasing length of a child’s utterances
over time, as a base-line for carrying out studies on the developmental com-
plexity of sentence structure. The notion was introduced to get round the
problem of correlating age with linguistic development.
medial (adj.) (med)
The usual way of referring to an element occurring within
a linguistic unit, other than in initial and ﬁnal positions. The term is
especially used in phonology, e.g. the phoneme /i/ occurs ‘in medial position’
(or ‘medially’) in the word seat.
medium (n.)
A term used in the study of communication to refer to the
functionally distinct dimensions in which a message is transmitted. In linguis-
tics, the basic media are speech and writing, but others are not excluded (e.g.
signing). Of these, speech is generally held in linguistics to be the ‘primary
medium’, writing the ‘secondary’ or ‘derived’ medium, and the analysis of the
differences between these media in structural and functional terms is an
important topic in linguistics. The term is usually distinguished from channel (as
used in communication theory), which refers to the physical means whereby a
(spoken or written) message is transmitted, such as a wire, air, light, etc. Terms
such as mode and modality are used in various branches of linguistics in a
similar way to ‘medium’.
mel (n.)
see pitch
mellow (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle (see
Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to handle
variations in place of articulation; its opposite is strident. Mellow sounds
are deﬁned articulatorily and acoustically, as those involving a less
complex or ‘smooth-edged’ constriction at the point of articulation, and marked
by acoustic energy of relatively low frequency and intensity, compared with
strident sounds. plosives and nasals are examples.
melodic tier
In some models of non-linear phonology, a term referring to
a level in a prosodic hierarchy at which articulatory gestures can be
300
meaning construction

represented, distinct from skeletal or syllabic tiers. For example, a long
vowel would be analysed as a single melody unit but would occupy two slots at
the skeletal tier; and a contour segment would occupy a single skeletal slot but
correspond to two articulatory gestures at the melodic tier. Several other items
have also been used as names for this level of representation (see tier).
mentalese (n.)
In some ﬁelds of linguistics, the concepts, and combinations
of concepts, postulated as a ‘language of thought’ (LOT), differing in various
ways from the grammar of natural language. A thought, in this context, is
conceived as an intentional state of mind representing something about the
world, including the various beliefs, hopes, and other propositional attitudes
held by the thinker. The approach is of special relevance in computational
linguistics, where mental processes can be modelled as sequences of mental
states and transitions. The relationship between language and thought is a par-
ticular (and controversial) focus of psycholinguistics.
mentalism (n.)
In linguistics, the inﬂuence of this school of thought (that
mental states and processes exist independently of their manifestations of beha-
viour, and can explain behaviour) is most marked in the work of Noam Chomsky,
especially in his notions of competence and innateness, and in his general
views of the relationship between language and mind (a ‘theory of mind’). In
this respect, mentalistic linguistics is opposed to the behaviourism of earlier
psychological work on language. See Chomskyan.
mental lexicon
see lexicon
mental spaces
A semantic theory introduced by Gilles Fauconnier (b. 1944)
that attempts to provide cognitive models of how speakers manage reference
to entities in discourse including the use of names, deﬁnite descriptions, and
pronouns. The theory assumes a grounding space of the situation of utterance,
and posits cognitive strategies by which speakers make links to past or hypo-
thetical situations, or within invented worlds like ﬁction.
mereology (n.)
In semantics, a term derived from logic for the study of the
relationship between parts and wholes. It is especially used in the context of
lattice frameworks. Some linguists, especially in structural semantics, make
use of the term meronymy for the same relationship.
merge (n.)
In the minimalist programme, an operation which forms larger
units out of those already constructed. Speciﬁcally, merge is a recursive process
which combines two lexical items, or one lexical item and a construction. In
later minimalist thinking, the operation move is regarded as a subtype of merge,
leading to a terminological reformulation: ‘move’ is called internal merge and
‘merge’ is called external merge.
merger (n.)
A term used in linguistics, especially in historical linguistics,
to refer to the coming together (or convergence) of linguistic units which
were originally distinguishable. In cases of two phonemes coming together, the
phrase phonemic merger is often used (the opposite phenomenon being referred
merge
301

to as ‘phonemic split’). For example, the /æp/ and /ep/ vowels in Old English have
now merged in modern English /ip/, as in clean and meet. Analogous terms
include coalescence, fusion and neutralization.
meronymy (n.)
A term used in semantics as part of the study of the sense
relations which relate lexical items. Meronymy is the relationship which
obtains between ‘parts’ and ‘wholes’, such as wheel and car or leg and knee. ‘X
is a part of Y’ (= X is a meronym of Y) contrasts especially with the ‘X is a kind
of Y’ relationship (hyponymy). The complementary relationship is holonymy
(= Y is a holonym of X). See also mereology.
mesolect (n.)
A term used by some sociolinguists, in the study of the devel-
opment of creole languages, to refer to the intermediate linguistic variety
(or lect) falling between acrolect and basilect. Because of the range of vari-
ation covered by this notion, a further distinction is often drawn between the
‘upper’ mesolect (i.e. that closest to the acrolect), the ‘lower’ mesolect (i.e. that
closest to the basilect) and the ‘mid’ mesolect (equidistant from the two); but
the extent to which mesolectal distinctions can be drawn in a non-arbitrary way
is disputed.
metadiscourse (n.)
A term used in the study of discourse for those features in
the organization or presentation of a text which help the reader to interpret or
evaluate its content. They include features of textual organization (e.g. headings,
spacing, and connectives such as ﬁrst and next) as well as such interpersonal
elements as hedges (perhaps), attitude markers (frankly), and dialogue features
(for example, see Figure 1).
metagrammar (n.)
A term used in linguistic theory to refer to a grammar
which contains a set of metarules.
metalanguage (n.) (1)
linguistics, as other sciences, uses this term in the
sense of a higher-level language for describing an object of study (or ‘object
language’) – in this case the object of study is itself language, viz. the various
language samples, intuitions, etc., which constitute our linguistic experience.
The subject of this dictionary is linguistic metalanguage. Metalinguistics is the study
of metalanguage, in this general sense. Other ‘meta’ notions will also be encoun-
tered, such as metarule and metadiscourse. See also language awareness.
(2)
The general term metalinguistics has a more speciﬁc sense within linguistics,
where some linguists have used it, especially in the 1950s, to refer to the overall
relation of the linguistic system to the other systems of behaviour in the asso-
ciated culture (compare the similar notion of context of situation). In this
view, only such a total account will constitute the full statement of the meanings
of the linguistic forms.
metalinguistic (adj.)
In semantics and pragmatics, a term sometimes applied
to operators, predicates, etc. when referring to non-semantic features of the
expressions they combine with, such as their phonetic or morphological
form. An example is provided by metalinguistic negation, in which the word
not is not used in its usual truth functional sense, but instead registers an
302
meronymy

objection to such features as the pronunciation or style of a previous or hypo-
thetical utterance.
metanalysis (n.)
A term sometimes used in historical linguistics, referring
to the formation of a new lexical item through a wrong analysis of an existing
word boundary; for example in early English a naddre came to be heard in the
popular mind as an adder, which has become the modern form. It is a kind of
folk etymology.
metaphony (n.)
A term used in phonology for a process of assimilation
which affects non-adjacent vowels in a word. The notion thus subsumes such
processes as vowel harmony and the type of phonological change which takes
place when a vowel changes its quality under the inﬂuence of a following vowel
(‘umlaut’), and is used both in synchronic and diachronic contexts.
metaphor (n.)
see conceptual metaphor
metarule (n.)
A term used in linguistic theory to refer to a type of rule which
deﬁnes some rules in a grammar on the basis of the properties of others already
present in the grammar. Metarules are particularly important in generalized
phrase-structure grammar, where they derive immediate dominance rules
from immediate dominance rules. They allow the capturing of certain general-
izations which are handled by transformation in transformational grammar;
for example, the relation between active and passive sentences is captured by a
metarule deriving rules for passive VPs from rules for active VPs. Metarules, it
has been said, in effect provide a grammar which can be used for generating a
grammar – in other words, a metagrammar.
metathesis (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to an alteration in the
normal sequence of elements in a sentence – usually of sounds, but some-
times of syllables, words, or other units. Metatheses are well recognized in
historical linguistics (e.g. Old English brid becoming bird), but they can
also be seen in performance errors – in such tongue-slips as aks for ask, or
in the phenomenon of ‘spoonerisms’ (cf. the dear old queen becoming the queer
old dean).
metonymy (n.)
A term used in semantics and stylistics, referring to a ﬁgure
of speech in which the name of an attribute of an entity is used in place of
the entity itself. People are using metonyms when they talk about the bottle (for
the drinking of alcohol) or the violins (in The second violins are playing well).
metric (n.)
see simplicity
metrical grid
A formalism used in some approaches to metrical phono-
logy to display hierarchic patterns of syllabic prominence, presented graph-
ically in columns (for relative prominence) and rows (for rhythmical structure).
Each syllable is assigned a position on a metrical grid, strong syllables being
assigned progressively higher layers in the grid. For example, the grids for
thirteen men and antique settee would be:

At the bottom layer (L1), or row, each terminal node of the tree is aligned
with a grid placeholder (marked by x); this layer is the grid’s terminal set. A
second layer is used to reﬂect the relative strength of -teen and men, as opposed
to thir-; and a third layer is used to reﬂect the relative strength of men as
opposed to -teen (w = weak, s = strong). Grid elements at the same layer are said
to be ‘adjacent’. Adjacent elements are ‘alternating’ if, at the next lower layer,
the elements corresponding to them (if any) are not adjacent (as in the antique
settee example); they are ‘clashing’ if their counterparts one layer down are
adjacent (as in the thirteen men example). The relationship between trees and
grids proved controversial: some phonologists argued that the formalisms are
equivalent, and that only grids need be represented (an ‘autonomous’ grid, ‘grid-
only’ phonology); some argued that only trees need be represented (‘tree-only’
phonology); and some argued that both are required, because they have different
functions (trees representing stress, grids representing rhythm). Grid construc-
tion is carried out using a set of parameters (e.g. quantity sensitivity). The
rhythmical basis of the grid is provided by the rule of perfect grid: a foot-layer
mark is added on top of alternating syllable-layer marks. Bracketed grid theory
is a metrical grid with constituency markers added, introduced to formalize a
constituent structure view of rhythm. Various notations have been proposed.
metrical phonology (MP)
A theory of phonology in which phonological
strings are represented in a hierarchical manner, using such notions as
segment, syllable, foot and word (see also prosodic phonology). Origin-
ally introduced as a hierarchical theory of stress, the approach developed to
cover the whole domain of syllable structure and phonological boundaries. Stress
patterns are considered to reﬂect, at least in part, relations of prominence between
syntactic and morphological constituents. The underlying metrical
structure of words and phrases may be represented in the form of a metrical
tree, whose nodes reﬂect the relative metrical strength between sister con-
stituents, as in the following examples (w = weak, s = strong):

Patterns of syllabic prominence can also be formally represented through the use
of metrical grids. Later developments of the theory represent phonological
relations in terms of parameters.
metrics (n.)
The traditional sense of this term – the study of versiﬁcation – is
interpreted in linguistics as the analysis of metrical structure using the whole
range of linguistic techniques, especially those belonging to segmental and
suprasegmental phonology. It has developed a special sense in the context of
metrical phonology.
metropolitanization (n.)
see creole
microlinguistics (n.)
A term used by some linguists, especially in the 1950s,
to refer to the main areas of linguistics, especially phonology, morpho-
logy and syntax, these being seen as constituting a sharply deﬁned ﬁeld of
study differentiable from prelinguistics and metalinguistics. In this frame
of reference, it was seen as a branch of macrolinguistics. More broadly,
the term can be used to distinguish complementary views of a subject, one
being strictly linguistic, the other being wider; for example, a study of meaning
which concentrates on denotative meaning and does not take sociolingu-
istic, etc., factors into account might be called microlinguistic (as opposed to
‘macrolinguistic’) semantics.
The term ‘microlinguistic’ is sometimes used outside this framework in a
general sense, to refer to any analysis of linguistic data involving a maximum
depth of detail. Likewise, the term microsociolinguistic (opposed to ‘macro-’) is
sometimes found.
microsociolinguistics (n.)
see macrolinguistics, microlinguistics
mid (adj.) (1)
A term used in the threefold phonetic classiﬁcation of vertical
tongue movement in vowel sounds, the others being high and low. It refers
to vowels made in the middle area of articulation, as in get, say, go or got.
Relatively high mid-vowels are sometimes described as mid-close, relatively low
mid-vowels as mid-open. See also close (1), open (1).

minimal-distance principle (MDP)
A term used in early psycholinguistics,
referring to a principle assumed to be generally applicable in the analysis of
complement structures of the type Mary wants Jim to go, where the subject of
the complement clause is Jim, i.e. the nearest noun phrase to the left of the
complement verb. As most complement-taking verbs conform to this principle
(e.g. like, hope, make), the notion was used especially in child language studies
to explain apparent anomalies in the acquisition of complements and other
similar types of structure. For example, in Mary promised Jim to go, the subject
minimal-distance principle
305

of go is Mary: this breaks the minimal-distance principle, and it is hypothesized
that children will have greater difﬁculty learning structures involving such verbs,
since they constitute exceptions to the general rule.
minimal free form
A term introduced into linguistics by Leonard Bloomﬁeld
(see Bloomﬁeldian) as part of his deﬁnition of word. The phrase can be glossed
as ‘the smallest linguistic form which can stand on its own as an utterance’.
minimalist programme/program (MP)
A development in generative linguistic
thinking, which emphasizes the aim of making statements about language
which are as simple and general as possible. The term ‘programme’ expresses
the notion that this is an ongoing research initiative, not a fully articulated
grammatical theory. All representations and derivational processes should
be as economical as possible, in terms of the number of devices proposed
to account for language phenomena (the principle of economy) – in effect, an
application of Occam’s razor. There should be no redundant or superﬂuous
elements in the representation of sentence structure: each element must play a
role and must be interpreted (the principle of full interpretation). The four
levels of representation recognized in standard government-binding theory
(D-structure, S-structure, logical form (LF) and phonetic form (PF)) are reduced
to two: LF and PF, referred to as interface levels. Minimally, the mapping
of sounds to meanings requires no more than a lexicon and a computational
(syntactic) procedure which gives lexical elements a phonological and a
semantic identity. The grammar is modelled as a computational system
containing a numeration of lexical items, to which operations of move and
merge apply in order to build up a structural description. All inﬂected
words are formed in the lexicon. Operations are driven by morphological
necessity, with features being checked for their applicability. Economy con-
straints, such as procrastinate and greed, are used to compare derivations
involving the same lexical resources and reject those which do not conform.
The derivation eventually splits into phonetic and semantic representations
(following spell-out), which must converge to produce grammatical sen-
tences. In post-2000 developments of the programme, the existence of the inter-
face levels of representation has been questioned. Derivation proceeds phase
by phase, and at the end of each phase relevant features are transferred to
articulatory phonetic and conceptual intentional systems. See also last resort,
least effort.
minimality (n.)
A term which is widely used in recent linguistics, especially
as part of the discussion of the formal properties of representations. For
example, in generative phonology, lexical minimality assumes that underly-
ing representations must reduce to some minimum the phonological informa-
tion used to distinguish lexical items. The notion of a minimal word is required
in some models of non-linear phonology. In prosodic morphology, for
instance, a ‘prosodic word’ must satisfy a minimality condition: according to the
prosodic hierarchy, any instance of a prosodic word must contain at least one
foot, and every foot must contain at least two moras (in quantity-sensitive
languages) or two syllables (in quantity-insensitive languages). A minimality
condition is also deﬁned in government-binding theory, formalizing the
306
minimal free form

view that an element governed by one relationship will not be governed by
another; in terms of a theory of barriers, nodes become barriers for an
element if they immediately dominate the nearest governor of that element.
Relativized minimality is the view that what counts as a governor is related to
what is being governed: an element will minimally govern its trace if there is no
other typical potential governor that is closer to the trace.
minimal link condition
see movement (1)
minimal pair
One of the discovery procedures used in phonology to
determine which sounds belong to the same class, or phoneme. Two words
which differ in meaning when only one sound is changed are referred to as a
‘minimal pair’, e.g. pin v. bin, cot v. cut, and linguists or native-speakers who
make these judgements are said to be carrying out a minimal pair test. A group
of words differentiated by each having only one sound different from all others,
e.g. big, pig, rig . . . is sometimes called a minimal set.
minimal set

minor (adj.) (1)
A term used by some linguists in the classiﬁcation of
sentence types to refer to a sentence (a minor sentence) with limited produc-
tivity (e.g. Please, Sorry) or one which lacks some of the constituents of the
language’s major (or favourite) sentence type (e.g. vocatives, elliptical
constructions).
(2)
For minor articulation in feature geometry, see major (2).
minority language
A language used in a country by a group which is signiﬁc-
antly smaller in number than the rest of the population; also called a linguistic
minority or language minority. Those who speak the language may be nationals
of the country, but they have distinguishing ethnic, religious or cultural features
which they wish to safeguard. Most countries have several minority languages
within their borders.
misderivation (n.)
A term used by some psycholinguists to refer to a type of
tongue-slip where the wrong afﬁx is attached to a word, as in kingness for
kingship.

MIT
The abbreviation for Massachusetts Institute of Technology, used in lin-
guistics as a label characterizing generative linguistic theory and method.

Chomsky, Morris Halle and their associates at MIT since the late 1950s. See

modal (adj.) (1)
A term used in phonetics to characterize the neutral or
unmarked state of the vibrating glottis, to which all other phonatory states
can be compared. Modal voice lacks any features of breathy voice, creak,
whisper, etc. The chest register is also referred to as the modal register.

modal auxiliary/verb
see mood
modal base
In possible-worlds analyses of modality, a term referring to the
set of worlds over which one must quantify in the interpretation of a modal
sentence. It is usually understood to be established at least partly on a prag-
matic basis.
modality (n.) (1)
A term used in grammatical and semantic analysis to refer
to contrasts in mood signalled by the verb and associated categories. In Eng-
lish, modal contrasts are primarily expressed by a subclass of auxiliary verbs,
e.g. may, will, can. This subclass is symbolized as M in the phrase-structure
rules of a generative grammar. Modal verbs share a set of morphological and
syntactic properties which distinguish them from the other auxiliaries, e.g. no
-s, -ing or -en forms. In case grammar, modality refers to one of the two major
constituents of a sentences’s deep structure, the other being proposition.

See medium.
modal subordination
A term used in semantic and pragmatic theory for
a pattern of interpretation in which a sentence containing a modal auxiliary
is interpreted as though it were conjoined to the consequent clause of a
conditional sentence present implicitly or explicitly in the preceding discourse.
An example is If John bought a book, he’ll be home reading it by now. It’ll be
a murder mystery. Modal subordination poses a challenge for certain theories of
anaphora.
mode (n.) (1)
A term used in the Hallidayan classiﬁcation of language
varieties, referring to the medium of the language activity which determines
the role played by the language in a situation. Mode (more fully, mode of
discourse) primarily includes the choice of speech v. writing (along with other
possible subdivisions, such as reading aloud, speech from notes, etc.), but also
includes choice of format (as in newspapers, commentary, poetry, etc.). The
main terms with which it contrasts are ﬁeld and style.
(2)
A term used in tagmemic analysis to label the various dimensions recog-
nized by the theory, e.g. the distinction between phonological, lexical and
grammatical ‘modes’ (which constitute the main components of the theory),
and between feature, manifestation and distribution ‘modes’ (which are
used to handle the units of linguistic description).

model (n./v.) (1)
This central notion of scientiﬁc enquiry has been applied in
several areas of linguistics and phonetics. A model is a specially designed
representation of concepts or entities, used to discover or explain their structure
or function. All models involve the mapping in a new conceptual dimension of
a set of elements recognized in the situation being modelled. For example, the
phonologist builds models of the organization of the speech continuum, using
such concepts as phonemes (sc. the ‘phonemic model of analysis’) or distinct-
ive features (sc. the ‘distinctive feature model’); the grammarian uses tree
diagrams, brackets and other such devices to help model syntactic structure.
One of the earliest uses of the term in linguistics was by the American linguist,
Charles Hockett (1916–2000), in a discussion of models of description in
morphology – a distinction being made between the ‘item-and-arrangement
model’ and the ‘item-and-process model’ (and, later, the ‘word-and-
paradigm model’). In discussion of generative grammar, and related develop-
ments in linguistic theory, the term is often used in the sense of ‘formal repres-
entation of a theory’, as when one contrasts the ‘Syntactic Structures model’
of generative grammar with the ‘Aspects model’. Sometimes, though, the term
‘model’ is used synonymously with ‘theory’ by some authors; usage is not
entirely consistent. However, there is now increasing awareness of the role of
models in linguistic enquiry, and of their strengths and limitations in generating
testable hypotheses.
(2)
In several areas of applied linguistics, one encounters the traditional sense
of a model as someone or something used as an exemplar of a level of language
achievement. For example, foreign-language teaching may use a native-speaker,
or a standard dialect, as a model of the language to be learned; speech
therapists may use themselves as models for language-disordered patients; English
teachers may use a certain piece of writing as a model of attainment for their class.
model-theoretic semantics
A version of truth-conditional semantics deve-
loped by Richard Montague (1930–71) and others. A class of models is deﬁned
for each language, and rules are formulated assigning truth values to sen-
tences relative to each model. Such notions as logical consequence and
logical truth may then be deﬁned by quantifying over the models relative to
which given sentences are true. Typically, a model consists of three components:
(a) a set of individuals, taken to constitute the domain of discourse; (b) an
arbitrary number of world–time pairs; and (c) an assignment of an extension
for each lexical item relative to each world–time pair.
modiﬁcation (n.) (1)
A term used in syntax to refer to the structural depend-
ence of one grammatical unit upon another – but with different restrictions
in the scope of the term being introduced by different approaches. Some reserve
the term for structural dependence within any endocentric phrase; e.g. in
the big man in the garden, both the big and in the garden modify man –
premodiﬁcation and post-modiﬁcation respectively. Some linguists reserve
the term for the premodifying structures only: in Hallidayan grammar, for
example, the above phrase would have the structure M–H–Q, standing for
modiﬁcation
309

modiﬁcation–head–qualiﬁcation. traditional grammar reserved the term
for adverbial units which were dependent on the verb, and this tradition is
sometimes encountered.
(2)
Modiﬁcation is also used in morphology to refer to a process of change
within the root or stem of a form, as in the vowel changes between the
singular and plural of some nouns in English (man ~ men), or in cases of
suppletion. In this, and related senses, the term is also found in historical
linguistics.
(3)
In phonetics, factors which inﬂuence the airﬂow in the vocal tract are
often referred to as modiﬁcations, e.g. the movement of the soft palate, the
degree of closure of the glottis. The term is also sometimes used to refer to
any factors which alter the typical actions of the vocal organs in producing
the phonemes of a language, as in prosodic features, secondary articula-
tions, and transitions between sounds.
(4)
Also in phonetics, the range of diacritic marks which indicate variations
in vowel and consonant quality are referred to as modiﬁers, in the interna-
tional phonetic alphabet.
modiﬁer (n.)

modularity (n.)
A term used in discussions of language in two slightly dif-
ferent ways. On the one hand, it is proposed, especially in J. A. Fodor’s The
Modularity of Mind (1983), that the mind is modular in the sense that it con-
sists of a number of different systems (modules), each with its own distinctive
properties, such as the language system and the vision system. On the other hand,
it is suggested, especially in government-binding theory, that the language
system itself is modular in the sense that it consists of a number of different
subsystems which interact in speciﬁc ways.
modulation (n.)
A term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to the
suprasegmental alterations introduced into an utterance for a particular
attitudinal or social effect, e.g. whispering, shouting.
module (n.)
see modularity
monadic (adj.)
see valency
mono-
A preﬁx used in phonetics and linguistics when one wants to
contrast the unitary manifestation of a linguistic concept with a multiple one.
Examples of this contrast are: monosyllabic words (or ‘monosyllables’) v. poly-
syllables; monomorphemic words (i.e. consisting of a single morpheme) v.
bimorphemic, etc.; monosystemic phonology (consisting of a single system of
phonemes) v. polysystemic; monosemy (consisting of a single meaning) v.
polysemy; and so on.
monogenesis (n.)
In historical linguistics, the hypothesis that all human
languages originate from a single source; contrasts with polygenesis, where
language is thought to have emerged more or less spontaneously in several
places. The terms are also used in discussing the similarities among pidgins and
310
modiﬁer

creoles: monogenetic theories assume the diffusion of a single pidgin to other
areas via migration; polygenetic theories assume that the development of a pidgin
in one community is independent of the development of a pidgin in another.
monolingual (adj./n.)

monomoraic (adj.)
see mora
monomorphemic (adj.)
see morpheme
monophthong (n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of vowel sounds
on the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to a vowel (a pure
vowel) where there is no detectable change in quality during a syllable, as
in English cart, cut, cot. Vowels which change in quality are known as diph-
thongs (or triphthongs). In some dialect and diachronic studies, a process
of monophthongization can be found, i.e. a change in vowel quality from a
diphthong to a monophthong.
monosemy (n.)
see polysemy
monostratal (adj.)
A term sometimes used in linguistic theory to refer to a
grammar which contains only a single level of representation (roughly equi-
valent to the transformational notion of surface structure). Examples are
generalized phrase-structure grammar, head-driven phrase-structure
grammar, and lexical-functional grammar. The contrast is intended with
generative grammars which recognize more than one level – typically, deep
structure as well as surface structure.
monosyllabic (adj.)
see polysyllable
monosystemic (adj.)
see polysystemicism
monotone (n.)
A term used in generalized quantiﬁer theory to refer to
a semantic property of noun phrases. A noun phrase is considered to be
monotone increasing if, whenever a set is in its denotation, all its supersets
will also be in its denotation. This has the effect that a sentence containing the
noun phrase as subject will systematically entail all sentences obtained by
replacing the verb phrase with a hypernym. For example, Every dog is mono-
tone increasing, so the sentence Every dog walks entails Every dog moves. The
reverse pattern is observed with monotone decreasing noun phrases: No dog is
monotone decreasing, so No dog moves entails No dog walks. This terminology
is sometimes extended to determiners, in which case the terms left monotone
increasing/decreasing and right monotone increasing/decreasing are used to
distinguish monotonicity properties based on the determiner’s common noun
and verb phrase arguments, respectively. See also the notions of ‘upward/
downward-entailing’ in entailment.

Montague grammar
A movement in linguistic theory in the mid-1970s which
owes its impetus to the thinking of the American logician Richard Montague
(1930–71). The approach uses a conceptual apparatus derived from the study of
the semantics of formal (logical) languages, and applies it to the analysis of
natural languages. The grammar contains a syntactic and a semantic com-
ponent, which are strictly related, in that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between categories set up at the two levels. The syntax is introduced through
categorial rules which deﬁne syntactic categories. The corresponding semantic
rules construct a propositional interpretation of these sentences, using the
notions of truth-conditional predicate logic. The approach has been modiﬁed
and extended in several ways – notably in relation to generalized phrase-
structure grammar. Approaches showing Montague’s inﬂuence are sometimes
characterized as ‘Montagovian’.
mood (n.)
A term used in the theoretical and descriptive study of sentence/
clause types, and especially of the verbs they contain. Mood (modality, or
mode) refers to a set of syntactic and semantic contrasts signalled by
alternative paradigms of the verb, e.g. indicative (the unmarked form),
subjunctive, imperative. Semantically, a wide range of meanings is involved,
especially attitudes on the part of the speaker towards the factual content of the
utterance, e.g. uncertainty, deﬁniteness, vagueness, possibility. Syntactically, these
contrasts may be signalled by alternative inﬂectional forms of a verb, or by
using auxiliaries. English mainly uses modal auxiliaries, e.g. may, can, shall,
must, but makes a little use of inﬂection (e.g. If I were you v. I was . . . ). The
semantic analysis of modal verbs, and the study of their distribution in everyday
speech, is a topic which has attracted a great deal of attention in linguistics,
and several classiﬁcations involving such notions as necessity, possibility,
certainty, etc., have been proposed. The results of such studies have implications
for ﬁelds other than linguistics; for example, theoretical modal distinctions
involving such notions have been a major concern of logicians. See also alethic,
deontic, epistemic.
mora (n.)
A term used in traditional studies of metrics to refer to a minimal
unit of metrical time or weight, and now used in some models of non-linear
phonology (e.g. metrical and prosodic phonology) as a separate level of
phonological representation. The analysis of segments into moras is usually
applied only to the syllabic nucleus and coda (the rhyme), and not to the
onset (‘onset/rhyme asymmetry’). Moraic structure accounts for many of the
phenomena described in other models by such notions as the skeletal tier.
In the prosodic hierarchy, the moraic level is symbolized by µ (‘mu’). The
notion of mora counting is used to handle languages where there is an opposi-
tion between heavy (two-mora, or bimoraic) syllables and light (one-mora, or
monomoraic) syllables, and the equivalence between various types of heavy
syllable. In Latin, for example, a long vowel was equivalent to two short vowels
or to a short vowel plus consonant.

Montague grammar

morpheme (n.)
The minimal distinctive unit of grammar, and the central
concern of morphology. Its original motivation was as an alternative to the
notion of the word, which had proved to be difﬁcult to work with in compar-
ing languages. Words, moreover, could be quite complex in structure, and
there was a need for a single concept to interrelate such notions as root,
preﬁx, compound, etc. The morpheme, accordingly, was seen primarily as the
smallest functioning unit in the composition of words.
Morphemes are commonly classiﬁed into free forms (morphemes which can
occur as separate words) and bound forms (morphemes which cannot so occur
– mainly afﬁxes): thus unselﬁsh consists of the three morphemes un, self and
ish, of which self is a free form, un- and -ish bound forms. A word consisting
of a single (free) morpheme is a monomorphemic word; its opposite is
polymorphemic. A further distinction may be made between lexical and gram-
matical morphemes; the former are morphemes used for the construction of new
words in a language, such as in compound words (e.g. blackbird), and afﬁxes
such as -ship, -ize; the latter are morphemes used to express grammatical
relationships between a word and its context, such as plurality or past tense
(i.e. the inﬂections on words). Grammatical morphemes which are separate
words are called (inter alia) function words.
As with all emic notions, morphemes are abstract units, which are realized
in speech by discrete units, known as morphs. The relationship is generally
referred to as one of exponence, or realization. Most morphemes are realized
by single morphs, as in the example above. Some morphemes, however, are
realized by more than one morph according to their position in a word or
sentence, such alternative morphs being called allomorphs (see allo-) or mor-
phemic alternants/variants. Thus the morpheme of plurality represented
orthographically by the -s in e.g. cots, digs and forces has the allomorphs
represented phonetically by {-s}, {-z} and {-iz} respectively (morphemes are
usually symbolized using brace brackets). In this instance the allomorphs result
from the phonetic inﬂuence of the sounds with which the singular forms of
the words terminate, the process being referred to as one of ‘phonological
conditioning’. The phenomenon of alternative morphemic realization is called
allomorphy.
The study of the arrangement of morphemes in linear sequence, taking such
factors into account, is morphotactics. The application of morphemic ideas to
the analysis of languages was particularly extensive in the 1940s and 1950s
in post-Bloomﬁeldian linguistics, when the approach came to be called
morphemics, and several analytical difﬁculties emerged. The English plural
morpheme illustrates some of these. When the plurality is simply added to the
root, as in the above examples, the correspondence between morpheme and
morph is straightforward. But in cases like mouse ~ mice and sheep ~ sheep it is
more problematic. Several solutions have been proposed to handle such cases: in
the case of sheep, for example, a zero morph of plurality may be recognized,
to preserve the notion of ‘sheep+plural’, this being symbolized as 0⁄. Other
concepts which have proved to be of importance in ‘morphemic analysis’ include
(a) the empty morph, set up to handle cases where a formal feature in a word
cannot be allocated to any morpheme, and (b) the portmanteau morph, set up
to handle cases where a formal feature can be allocated to more than one
morpheme. Submorpheme is a term sometimes used to refer to a part of a
morpheme
313

morpheme that has recurrent form and meaning, such as the sl- beginning of
slimy, slug, etc.
morpheme-based morphology
see morphology
morpheme-structure rules/conditions
Terms used in generative phonology
to refer to the processes which have attempted to cope with redundancy in
carrying out an analysis. When segments co-occur, the presence of a feature
characterizing one segment may make it unnecessary to specify a certain feature
in another segment: the constraints involved are handled by morpheme-
structure (or ‘lexical-redundancy’) rules. For example, given an English
morpheme which has an affricate in initial position, it is predictable that the
following segment will be a vowel. It would then be possible to leave the
features for vowels (e.g. [−consonantal], [+sonorant]) blank in the underlying
form of the morpheme, the appropriate values being ﬁlled in automatically by
the application of the relevant morpheme-structure rule at some subsequent
point in the derivation. Several problems with this view led to a subsequent
proposal to handle these redundancies in terms of morpheme-structure condi-
tions, which state more explicitly the processes constraining the correspondences
between segments, without recourse to the blank-ﬁlling procedure.
morphemic alternant, morphemic variant, morphemics (n.)
see morpheme
morphology (n.)
The branch of grammar which studies the structure or
forms of words, primarily through the use of the morpheme construct. It is
traditionally distinguished from syntax, which deals with the rules governing
the combination of words in sentences. It is generally divided into two ﬁelds:
the study of inﬂections (inﬂectional morphology) and of word-formation
(lexical or derivational morphology) – a distinction which is sometimes accorded
theoretical status (split morphology). When emphasis is on the technique of
analysing words into morphemes, particularly as practised by American struc-
turalist linguists in the 1940s and 1950s, the term morphemics is used.
Morphemic analysis in this sense is part of a synchronic linguistic study;
morphological analysis is the more general term, being applied to diachronic
studies as well.
Morphological analysis may take various forms. One approach is to make
a distributional study of the morphemes and morphemic variants occur-
ring in words (the analysis of morphotactic arrangements), as in item-and-
arrangement models of description. Another approach sets up morphological
processes or operations, which see the relationships between word forms as one
of replacement (e.g. replace the /e}/ of take with the /ä/ of took), as in item-and-
process models.
In early generative linguistics, morphology and syntax are not seen as
two separate levels; the syntactic rules of grammar apply to the structure of
words, as they do to phrases and sentences, and morphological notions emerge
only at the point where the output of the syntactic component has to be given
a phonological representation (via the morphophonological rules).
Natural morphology (NM) is an approach which aims to describe and explain
universal tendencies in word-formation (such as the preference for deriving
314
morpheme-based morphology

nouns from verbs, rather than the reverse). Prosodic morphology is a theory of
how morphological and phonological determinants of linguistic form interact.
In afﬁxal (as opposed to non-afﬁxal) morphology, the only permissible mor-
phological operation is the combining of afﬁxes and stems. Morphologically
driven processes have become increasingly recognized within generative linguistics
in recent years; for example, morphological features play a central role in the
minimalist programme. Examples such as refer and deceive have also fuelled
a debate between morpheme-based and word-based views of morphology:
because -fer and -ceive are not independent morphemes, it is unclear how such
words can best be handled, whether through the use of regular afﬁxing pro-
cesses (as in morpheme-based approaches) or not.
morphonology, morphophonology (n.)
see morphophonemics
morphophoneme (n.)
The basic unit recognized in a morphophonemic level
of analysis. It is usually symbolized by the use of a capital letter within brace
brackets, e.g. {F}, {T}. One of the original examples used in order to justify
establishing this entity was the alternation between /f/ and /v/ in some English
plurals, such as knife ~ knives. There is no predictable alternation between /f/
and /v/ for English words in general, but only in this speciﬁc grammatical
context. This fact, it is argued, can be captured by setting up a morphophoneme
{F}, as in {na}F}: in a singular context this is realized as /f/, in a plural context as
/v/. Each morphophonemic symbol thus represents the class of phonemes which
occurs within a particular set of grammatical environments. In later linguistic
theory, the term systematic phoneme is more widespread.
morphophonemics (n.)
A branch of linguistics referring to the analysis and
classiﬁcation of the phonological factors which affect the appearance of
morphemes, or, correspondingly, the grammatical factors which affect the
appearance of phonemes. In the European tradition, morphophonology
(or morphonology) is the preferred term; in the American tradition, it is
morphophonemics. In some theories, morphophonemics is seen as a separate
level of linguistic structure intermediate between grammar and phonology (see
morphophoneme). In early versions of generative grammar, morphophonemic
rules were distinguished as a separate component in the derivation of sen-
tences, whereby a terminal string of morphemes would be converted into
their correct phonological form. In later generative theory, the term systematic
phonemics became standard.
morphophonology (n.)
see morphophonemics
morphosyntactic (adj.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to grammatical
categories or properties for whose deﬁnition criteria of morphology and
syntax both apply, as in describing the characteristics of words. The distinc-
tions under the heading of number in nouns, for example, constitute a
morphosyntactic category: on the one hand, number contrasts affect syntax
(e.g. singular subject requiring a singular verb); on the other hand, they require
morphological deﬁnition (e.g. add -s for plural). Traditional properties such as
singular, perfect, indicative, passive, accusative, third person are examples
of morphosyntax.

mother (n.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to a relation between
nodes in a phrase-marker. If one node X immediately dominates another
node Y, then X is the mother of Y, and Y is the daughter of X.
motherese (n.)
A term commonly used in early study of child language
acquisition for the distinctive way in which mothers talk to their young
children. Its features include simpliﬁed grammar, exaggerated intonation
patterns, diminutive forms of words (e.g. doggie), a repetitive style and a
tendency to expand the child’s reduced utterances. A correlative notion of fatherese
has also been proposed, but is rarely used; both notions are often now
subsumed under the broader concept of child-directed speech, which includes
grandparents, nannies and other carers, as well as parents. The term baby-
talk, formerly widely used for this phenomenon, is not now usual in
psycholinguistics.

motor theory (1)
A term used in phonetics and psycholinguistics to refer
to a theory of speech perception which proposes that the brain of the listener
constructs a model of the articulatory (‘motor’) movements being produced
by the speaker. It is not usually interpreted as someone having to ‘talk in
parallel’ (i.e. subvocally) while listening – a view for which there is little support
– but, rather, as an abstract mechanism, or model, which can help explain the
indirect correspondences between the features of the acoustic signal and the
segments the listener actually perceives.

move alpha (ααααα)
A term used in government-binding theory to refer to a
single, universal movement rule, which subsumes all speciﬁc movement rules;
also called alpha movement. The rule permits the movement of any phrasal
or lexical category from one part of a sentence to another in such a way
that the operation involves substitution or (Chomsky-)adjunction. The

application of the transformation is restricted by the subjacency principle
of bounding (sub-)theory, and its output is subject to a variety of ﬁlters,
principles, etc. stated by other (sub-)theories of GB. See also affect alpha.
movement (n.) (1)
A term often used within the framework of transforma-
tional grammar to refer to a basic kind of transformational operation. Move-
ment transformations have the effect of moving constituents (usually one at
a time) from one part of a phrase-marker to another (the ‘landing site’), as
in the formation of passive sentences. An alternative term is reordering or
permutation. In some approaches this notion is broken down into the more
basic operations of adjunction and deletion. Two main types of movement
rules have been used: WH-movement and NP-movement (as when such passive
sentences as The cup was put on the table are said to derive from – was put the
cup on the table by NP-movement of the cup). Other such rules have been
proposed from time to time, such as dative movement (to handle such altera-
tions as X gave Y to Z and X gave Z Y) and though movement (to handle such
sentences as good writer though she is . . . ); but the need for these has been
disputed. The possibility that all movement rules may be reﬂexes of a single,
universal rule (referred to as move alpha) has also now been proposed. In later
formulations, the category which has been moved leaves behind an empty node,
or trace: this approach is known as the ‘trace theory of movement rules’. A
moved constituent and its co-indexed trace form a movement chain. In the
minimalist programme, move is a basic operation which moves elements
about in the process of tree construction. Movement is constrained in various
ways. Only the shortest movements of an element are acceptable (shortest
move) into the nearest relevant position (the minimal link condition). Movements
should be delayed until absolutely necessary (procrastinate). And movements
must satisfy the requirements of the moved element (greed). In earlier formula-
tions of the programme, move existed alongside merge; later formulations regard
move as a subtype of merge. In this approach, move is called ‘internal merge’
and merge is called ‘external merge’.

multidimensional scaling
A statistical technique which has been applied in
psycholinguistics to quantify the meanings of related lexical items and
deﬁne the semantic space within which these items work. informants rate
numerically a set of items (e.g. kinship terms, colours) in terms of their mutual
similarity; the more similar the average ratings are, the closer these items are
placed in the hypothetical space. In this inductive manner, it is hoped to estab-
lish classiﬁcatory criteria for lexical sets which might otherwise not emerge, and
to develop more illuminating models of semantic structure than are available
using conventional analytic techniques. The technique is also used in phonetics,
along with other statistical methods.
multilateral (adj.)
A type of opposition recognized in Prague School phono-
logy, distinguished from bilateral. The opposition between English /t/ and /v/
is multilateral, because there are several possibilities of contrast involving
multilateral
317

the same set of features, e.g. /d/ v. /f/. The opposition between /t/ and /d/,
however, is bilateral, because these are the only units in the system which are
alveolar/plosive, and they are differentiated by the single feature of voicing.
multilingual (adj./n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer (as an adjective)
to a speech community which makes use of two or more languages, and then
(as an adjective or noun) to the individual speakers who have this ability; it
contrasts with monolingual. Multilingualism (or plurilingualism) in this sense
may subsume bilingualism (see bilingual), but it is often contrasted with it (i.e.
a community or individual in command of more than two languages). A further
distinction is sometimes made between a multilingualism which is internal to
a speech community (i.e. for routine domestic communicative purposes), and
one which is external to it (i.e. an additional language being used to facilitate
communication with other nations, as in the use of a lingua franca). Socio-
linguistic studies have emphasized both the frequency and complexity of the
phenomenon: on the one hand, there are very few speech communities which
are totally monolingual (because of the existence of linguistic minority groups
within their boundaries); on the other hand, the multilingual abilities demon-
strated are of several levels of proﬁciency, and raise different kinds of political,
educational and social problems, depending on the numbers, social standing and
national feeling of the groups concerned.

A term used in linguistics, especially in historical linguis-

sounds in adjacent morphemes or words. For example, in the period when
Old English was developing, the inﬂuence of an /i/ vowel in certain circum-
stances caused other vowels to mutate in the direction of the close vowel, e.g.
*foti became feet. The term is also occasionally used in synchronic contexts,
as in the mutation of various initial consonants in Welsh after certain words,
e.g. pen ‘head’ ⇒ fy mhen ‘my head’.

mutual intelligibility
A criterion used in linguistics, referring to the ability of
people to understand each other. If two varieties of speech are mutually intel-
ligible, they are strictly dialects of the same language; if they are mutually
unintelligible, they are different languages. The criterion seems simple, but there
are many problem cases. Two varieties may be partially intelligible – for example,
because they share some vocabulary. Also, political or cultural factors may
intervene, causing two mutually intelligible varieties to be treated as different
languages (e.g. Swedish and Danish) or two mutually unintelligible varieties to
be treated as the same language (e.g. the so-called ‘dialects’ of Chinese).

narrative (adj./n.)
An application of the everyday use of this term, as part of
the linguistic study of discourse, which aims to determine the principles
governing the structure of narrative texts. A narrative is seen as a recapitula-
tion of past experience in which language is used to structure a sequence of
(real or ﬁctitious) events. The structural study of narrative is known as narrato-
logy. Structural elements are proposed, such as those which initiate a narrative
(e.g. a summarizing abstract, a story orientation) or those which close it (a
closing summary, a narrator’s evaluation). There is a focus on such notions as
theme, plot, character, role, and point of view, especially in studies of literary
narrative.

narrow (adj.) (1)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of types of phonetic tran-
scription. A ‘narrow’ transcription is more detailed than a ‘broad’ transcription.

A term used in the description of types of vowel, referring to a vowel which
is articulated with less pharynx width than another with the same tongue and
lip conﬁguration; it is opposed to wide.
narrowing (n.)
In historical linguistics, a term used in the classiﬁcation of
types of semantic change, referring to a restriction of meaning in a lexical
item; opposed to extension. For example, in Old English mete ‘meat’ referred
to food in general, whereas today it refers to only one kind of food.
n-ary feature
see binary feature
nasal (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds on
the basis of manner of articulation: it refers to sounds produced while the
soft palate is lowered to allow an audible escape of air through the nose. Both
consonants and vowels may be articulated in this way. Nasal consonants
(sometimes represented as a class by N or nas) occur when there is a complete
closure in the mouth, and all the air thus escapes through the nose. Examples
in English are the ﬁnal consonants of ram, ran, rang [ram, ran, raº], where the

closures are in bilabial, alveolar and velar positions respectively. Several
other nasal sounds are possible, e.g. in palatal positions [¢], as in Spanish
mañana. voiceless nasal sounds also occur, as when a nasal consonant follows
[s] in English, e.g. small, snooze. In nasal (or nasalized) vowels, air escapes
through nose and mouth simultaneously; the vowels are transcribed with [~]
above the symbol, e.g. [ã]. Nasal vowels are opposed to oral vowels in a
language, as in French and Portuguese. English has no distinct nasal vowels, but
nasalization is often heard on English vowels, when they display the articulatory
inﬂuence of an adjacent nasal consonant, as in mat or hand. The vowel in a
word like man may be articulated with the soft palate lowered throughout,
because of this inﬂuence – an instance of anticipatory coarticulation. Such
cases, where the nasality comes from other sounds, would be referred to as
‘nasalized’ vowels; the term ‘nasal vowel’, on the other hand, suggests that the
nasality is an essential identifying feature of the sound. A ‘nasalized conson-
ant’, likewise, would refer to a consonant which, though normally oral in a
language, was being articulated in a nasal manner because of some adjacent
nasal sound.
Stop consonants (and sometimes fricatives) may be articulated with a pre-
nasal onset or post-nasal release, depending on the timing of the velic closure
relative to the oral closure: Swahili, for example, has a series of pre-nasalized
stops. The opposite term is denasalized, which would be applied only to sounds
which normally were articulated with a nasal component (as when one speaks
through a blocked nose). In certain clinical conditions, such as cleft palate,
abnormal degrees of nasalization may be present: excessively nasal (or hypernasal)
speech is here opposed to reduced nasality (or hyponasal speech).
Other nasal effects may be heard in a language. A plosive sound, for example,
when followed by a nasal articulated in the same position, may be released
through the nose instead of the mouth, and the resulting auditory effect is one of
nasal plosion, as in sudden [sÎdÚ], which is rather more likely than [sÎdvn].
Nasal twang is not a term with a precise phonetic deﬁnition, as it refers to any
degree of nasal effect in a speaker or accent, seen in contrast with speech which
is more oral in character.
The opposition between nasal and oral is given a special technical status in
the distinctive feature theory of phonology, where it works alongside other
two-way contrasts as part of the complete speciﬁcation of a sound system. In
Chomsky and Halle’s theory (see Chomskyan), for example, it is classiﬁed as a
cavity feature, and grouped along with lateral under the speciﬁc heading of
secondary apertures. See also -ise/-ize.

native-speaker (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to someone for whom
a particular language is a ﬁrst language or mother-tongue. The implication is
that this native language, having been acquired naturally during childhood, is
the one about which a speaker will have the most reliable intuitions, and
whose judgements about the way the language is used can therefore be trusted.
In investigating a language, accordingly, one is wise to try to obtain information
from native-speaking informants, rather than from those who may have learned
native-speaker
321

it as a second or foreign language (even if they are highly proﬁcient). Many
people do, however, develop a ‘native-like’ command of a foreign language, and
in bilingualism one has the case of someone who has a native command of two
languages (see bilingual). The term has become a sensitive one in those parts
of the world where native has developed demeaning connotations.

natural generative phonology (NGP)
A model of phonology which requires
that phonological rules and representations bear a direct relation to sur-
face linguistic forms. This differs from natural phonology (see phonology) in
several respects (in particular, it allows less abstractness in its underlying
representation). Its aim is to formulate the strongest possible (universal) con-
straints on phonological rules (‘P-rules’), all of which make generalizations
about the surface forms of the language.
natural-kind terms
In the semantic analysis of nouns, a type of general term
for entities which have an identity in nature (as opposed to artefactual, abstract
and other general terms). They include some sortal terms (e.g. lion), where a
notion of individuation is involved, and some mass terms (e.g. water), where
there is no such notion. Their study has been important in the development of
theories of direct reference.
natural language processing (NLP)
In computational linguistics, the com-
putational processing of textual materials in natural human languages. The
aim is to devise techniques which will automatically analyse large quantities of
spoken (transcribed) or written text in ways which are broadly parallel to what
happens when humans carry out this task. The ﬁeld emerged out of machine
translation in the 1950s, and came to be much inﬂuenced by research in arti-
ﬁcial intelligence. Later work concentrated on devising ‘intelligent programs’ (or
‘expert systems’) which would simulate aspects of human behaviour, such as the
way people use their knowledge of the world and their ability to draw inferences
in order to make interpretations and reach conclusions. A more speciﬁcally
linguistic contribution involves detailed syntactic, semantic and discourse
analysis, often on a much larger scale than hitherto, and using the large amounts
of lexical data currently available in computer corpora.
natural morphology
see morphology
naturalness (n.)
A notion introduced into (especially generative) linguistic
theory to refer to the phonetic plausibility of an analysis, which is seen as
an important criterion in evaluating analyses alongside such other criteria as
simplicity. An analysis, it is argued, must make phonetic sense, if it is to have
322
nativism

any explanatory role in relation to the speaker’s behaviour, e.g. such factors as
relative ease of articulation must be taken into account. One of the ﬁrst steps
in deﬁning naturalness more formally is to recognize the notion of natural class.
A set of segments is said to constitute a natural class if fewer phonetic fea-
tures are needed to specify the set as a whole than to specify any one member
of the set. The set of voiced plosive segments in English is a natural class, on
this basis: /b/, /d/ and /ì/ all share the features of voicing, instantaneous
release and interrupted; but, to specify any one of these, further features
would be required (e.g. /d/ would be coronal, in addition).
The term in this sense applies to any set of speech segments which can be
shown to have a highest common factor in this way; but as it stands the
criterion needs to be supplemented by others, as it is too general (e.g. it would
allow for all sounds in a language to be considered a natural class, on the
grounds that they are all pulmonic egressive). Several other relevant criteria
have been suggested, e.g. that the set of sounds all turn up in the same phono-
logical rules, undergoing similar processes together. Also, there are several
difﬁculties in working with the notion in terms of features, e.g. the more natural
solution is not always the simpler. The notion of naturalness has thus been
developed to take into account the relative naturalness of (a) segments (mainly
through the use of the marking convention), (b) sound systems (by computing
the relative complexity of its units, this being deﬁned in terms of marking
values) and (c) phonological rules (based on the tendency for some phonological
processes to be more frequent and phonetically more expected than others, e.g.
/i/ becoming /u/ rather than /„/, or certain types of assimilation or syllable
structures being preferred). These developments are continuing.
natural order hypothesis
In language acquisition, the view that children follow
essentially the same path in learning a language, and that when adults learn a
foreign language they follow essentially the same path that they used when
learning their mother-tongue. The motivation for the hypothesis came from
observing the way many learners make similar errors (e.g. I going), regardless of
their language background. It is suggested that a universal creative process is at
work: in an early terminology, learners were said to follow a natural ‘internal
syllabus’ (as opposed to the ‘external’ syllabus of the classroom). Because
several of the errors closely resemble those made by children learning their ﬁrst
language, a parallel was proposed between the natural order of ﬁrst-language
acquisition and the way people acquire a foreign language. However, with
the accumulation of more data, several differences between ﬁrst- and foreign-
language acquisition have been observed.
natural phonology
see phonology
negation (n.)
A process or construction in grammatical and semantic analysis
which typically expresses the contradiction of some or all of a sentence’s mean-
ing. In English grammar, it is expressed by the presence of the negative particle
(neg, NEG) not or n’t (the contracted negative); in lexis, there are several
possible means, e.g. preﬁxes such as un-, non-, or words such as deny. Some
languages use more than one particle in a single clause to express negation
negation
323

(as in French ne . . . pas). The use of more than one negative form in the same
clause (as in double negatives) is a characteristic of some English dialects, e.g.
I’m not unhappy (which is a stylistically marked mode of assertion) and I’ve
not done nothing (which is not acceptable in standard English). See also
concord.
A topic of particular interest has been the range of sentence structure affected
by the position of a negative particle, e.g. I think John isn’t coming v. I don’t
think John is coming: such variations in the scope of negation affect the logical
structure as well as the semantic analysis of the sentence. The opposite ‘pole’ to
negative is positive (or afﬁrmative), and the system of contrasts made by a
language in this area is often referred to as polarity. Negative polarity items
are those words or phrases which can appear only in a negative environment in
a sentence, e.g. any in I haven’t got any books (cf. *I’ve got any books).

neighbourhood (n.)
In phonetics and psycholinguistics, a term used in the
study of spoken word recognition to refer to all the words that can be derived
from a particular word by replacing one sound in any position. For example, the
neighbourhood of the word cat includes pat, cut, cap, can, cot, and many more.
When a word has a large number of neighbours, it is said to be from a dense
neighbourhood; a word with few neighbours is from a sparse neighbourhood.
Neighbourhood density affects the speed and accuracy with which words are
produced and recognized. See lexical access.

neogrammarian (adj./n.)
A follower of, or characteristic of the principles of, a
nineteenth-century school of thought in comparative philology, initiated by
the German scholars K. Brugmann (1849–1919) and S. A. Leskien (1840–1916).
Their main tenet was that sound laws admitted no exceptions (the neogrammarian
hypothesis). Their nickname in German Junggrammatiker (‘young grammarians’)
arose from the attitude of older scholars who, while not necessarily rejecting
the principle, objected to the forceful way in which it was promulgated.
neologism (n.)
see nonce
nesting (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the insertion of one
or more linguistic units (usually phrases or clauses) within the structure of
an endocentric phrase. A phrase such as the table in the corner with the
candlesticks near the window shows several modifying phrases recursively
nested (see embedded). Nested dependencies result in grammaticality, whereas
324
negative concord

crossing ones do not; for example, Which violini is this sonataj easy to play tj on
ti? is grammatical, whereas Which sonatai is this violinj easy to playi on tj? is not.
network (n.)
In sociolinguistics a term which deﬁnes the set of linguistic
interactions that a speaker has with others. In a uniplex network people relate
to each other in just one way – such as through the family, work, church or a
sporting activity. In a multiplex network, people relate to each other in a variety of
ways, repeatedly renewing their contact through sharing a range of social activities.
Network English
see General American
network grammar
A term used for a class of grammars which have developed
out of the concerns of computational linguistics and artiﬁcial intelligence,
to show how language understanding can be simulated. A network is a state-
and-path representation of a sentence – ‘states’ being the points at which a
new condition can be introduced, in putting together a construction, and
‘paths’ being the transitions between states, which are dependent on a condition
being met. Two main types of network grammar have been proposed: pro-
cedural grammars and augmented transition network grammars. These
grammars extract and store information from a text, and use the results to
decide what grammatical and semantic structures lie behind it. The grammat-
ical breakdown of a text is known as a parse, which contains syntactic,
semantic and referential information. In this approach, the analysis is presented
pictorially (using rectangles, circles and lines) as well as in words and formulae.

neurolinguistics (n.)
A branch of linguistics, sometimes called neurological
linguistics, which studies the neurological basis of language development and
use, and attempts to construct a model of the brain’s control over the processes
of speaking, listening, reading, writing and signing. The main approach has been
to postulate the stages of a neural program(me), which would explain the observed
phenomena of temporal articulatory co-ordination, sequencing and other
features of speech production. Central to this approach have been the research
ﬁndings from the study of clinical linguistic conditions (such as aphasia,
dysarthria, stuttering), in an attempt to deduce the nature of the underlying
system from the analysis of its various stages of breakdown. Also important is
the study of speech production in parametric articulatory phonetic terms –
especially of the ‘normal’ errors which are introduced into speech (e.g. tongue-
slips, hesitations). A third major area is the study of the processes involved
in lexical access. There is a tenuous connection with the use of the term in
neurolinguistic programming (NLP), which is a technique in alternative medi-
cine that shows people how to change (‘reprogramme’) their habitual patterns of
thought and behaviour, using various mental exercises to create new ways of
thinking and feeling.

neuter (adj.)

neutral (adj.) (1)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of lip position in phonetics,
referring to the visual appearance of the lips when they are held in a relaxed
position, with no lip-rounding, and a medium lowering of the jaw, as in the
vowels of pet or bird. It is contrasted with spread, open and rounded lip
positions.
(2)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of vowel sounds, to refer to a lax vowel
made in the centre of the vowel articulation area, with the tongue neutral
with respect to front, back, high or low positions. The most widely encoun-
tered vowel of this quality is heard in the ﬁrst vowel of asleep, balloon, or
the last vowel in mother, cover. It is usually referred to as schwa [v]. Several
terms for this quality have been proposed, including ‘central’, ‘medium’ and
‘murmured’ vowel.
neutralization (n.)
A term used in phonology to describe what happens when
the distinction between two phonemes is lost in a particular environment. For
example, in English, the contrast between aspirated (voiceless) and unaspirated
(voiced) plosives is normally crucial, e.g. tip v. dip, but this contrast is lost, or
neutralized, when the plosive is preceded by /s/, as in stop, skin, speech, and as
a result there are no pairs of words in the language of the type /sk}n/ v. /*sì}n/.
From a phonetic point of view, the explanation lies in the phonetic change
which happens to /k/ in this position: the /k/ lacks aspiration and comes to be
physically indistinguishable from /ì/. In the original Prague School formula-
tion of this notion, neutralizable was seen as a type of opposition, and con-
trasted with constant. The neutralization of a contrast in a particular location
(e.g. at the end of a word) is referred to as positional neutralization. In early
generative phonology, absolute neutralization refers to cases where an under-
lying form is never given a phonetic realization. In optimality theory,
neutralization is used for cases where a feature occurs in an inventory, but a
context-speciﬁc condition overrides general considerations of faithfulness. See
also syncretism.
new (adj.)
A term used by some linguists in a two-part analysis of utterances
on the basis of information structure; ‘new’ information is opposed to given.
(The contrast between focus and presupposition makes an analogous distinc-
tion.) ‘New’, as its name suggests, refers to information which is additional to
that already supplied by the previous context of speaking; ‘given’, by contrast,
refers to the information already available. In the clearest cases, new informa-
tion is identiﬁed by intonational emphasis within the tone unit, the nuclear
tone (or primary stress) signalling its focus, e.g. I’ve got thrèe books in my bag
v. I’ve got three books in my bàg, and so on. Several problems arise in determining
the scope of the new information, with reference to the previous context,
however, which have been the subject of much discussion, e.g. A: What can you
see? B: I can see cthree mèn, where the three is plainly part of the new information,
but does not carry the nuclear tone.

New Englishes
In sociolinguistic approaches to English, the name often given
to the national varieties of the language which have emerged around the globe,
especially since the 1960s in those countries which opted to make English an
ofﬁcial language upon independence. Regionally distinctive use of vocabulary,
pronunciation and grammar is found in all such countries, but often only on
a very limited scale. The term is really applicable only when there has been
considerable linguistic development away from the traditional standards of
British and American English, with some degree of local standardization (e.g. in
the press), as has happened in India, Ghana and Singapore, and several other
countries where English is used as a second language. It has thus also come to be
applied to ﬁrst-language situations, such as in Canada, Australia and South
Africa, as well as in areas where creole or pidgin Englishes are important,
such as the Caribbean and Papua New Guinea – even though in these cases the
Englishes in question have a considerable history behind them.
nexus (n.), (plural nexi) (1)
In the approach to grammar of Otto Jespersen
(1860–1943), a term which describes the kind of relationship which exists between
an element and its predicate, such as ‘subject of’ or ‘object of’ (as in the dog
barks); it is distinguished from a junction, which is a relationship between a
primary word and an adjunct (e.g. the barking dog). Several other notions
were derived from this basic terminology, e.g. ‘nexus-word’, ‘nexus-question’.
(2)
A term used in role and reference grammar to describe that part of
the grammar which deals with the syntactic relationships obtaining between
sub-clausal units. It is seen in association with a theory of juncture.
NOCODA
In optimality theory, the label for the constraint that penal-
izes syllables which end with one or more consonants (i.e. those syllables
which contain a coda).
no-crossing constraint (NCC)
A constraint used in non-linear phonology
which states that association lines linking two elements on one tier with two
elements on another tier may not cross. In the ﬁgure, (a) is possible; (b) is not.
node (n.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to any point in a tree
from which one or more branches emanate. A ‘family’ metaphor is often used
in the discussion of nodes. A node which immediately dominates another is
called a ‘mother’ node; the dominated node is its ‘daughter’; if two nodes are
directly dominated by the same node, they are ‘sister’ nodes. A node which is
separated from its mother in a derivation is said to have been ‘orphaned’. The
topmost node of the tree diagram is the ‘root’. Nodes which do not dominate
other categories (i.e. they are at the bottom of the tree) are terminal nodes or
leaf nodes; nodes which do dominate other categories are non-terminal nodes.

(aperiodic) vibrations (see period). Noise is an important feature of speech, being
part of the acoustic deﬁnition of several consonant sounds and voice qualities,
such as fricatives and breathy voice.

See communication.
nominal (adj./n.) (nom, NOM)
A term used in some grammatical descrip-
tions as a substitute for noun (e.g. nominal group = ‘noun phrase’). In a more
restricted sense, nominals refer to words which have some of the attributes of
nouns but not all, e.g. the poor are many, where the head word of this phrase
does not pluralize (*the poors). Nominalization refers to the process of forming
a noun from some other word-class (e.g. red + ness) or (in classical trans-
formational grammar especially) the derivation of a noun phrase from an
underlying clause (e.g. Her answering of the letter . . . from She answered the
letter). An afﬁx which does this is a nominalizer. The term is also used in the
classiﬁcation of relative clauses (e.g. What concerns me is her attitude). Some
linguistic theories use the term in a more general sense, as in cognitive
grammar, where ‘nominals’ (‘things’, chieﬂy noun phrases) are distinguished
from relational expressions.
nominalization (n.)

nominalizer (n.)

nominative (adj./n.) (nom, NOM)
In languages which express grammatical
relationships by means of inﬂections, this term refers to the form taken by
a noun phrase (often a single noun or pronoun) when it is the subject of
a verb. The ‘nominative case’ (‘the nominative’) is usually the ﬁrst form to be
listed in a grammatical paradigm, or in a dictionary, and is often the unmarked
form (see oblique), e.g. in Latin, homo (‘man’) is nominative singular (cf.
hominem, hominis, etc.). The term is also used in generative grammar, to refer
to the case assigned to the subject NP in a ﬁnite clause. In the phrase
nominative island condition, it refers to a type of constraint on the freedom of
movement of items occurring inside a clause containing a nominative-marked
subject. In government-binding theory, NOM case is assigned to the NP
governed by I with AGR, i.e. to the subject in a ﬁnite clause.

nonce (adj.)
A term describing a linguistic form which a speaker consciously
invents or accidentally uses on a single occasion: a nonce word or a nonce
formation (which may involve units larger than the word). Many factors
account for their use, e.g. a speaker cannot remember a particular word, so
coins an alternative approximation (as in linguistiﬁed, heard from a student who
felt he was getting nowhere with linguistics), or is constrained by circumstances
to produce a new form (as in newspaper headlines). Nonce formations have
occasionally come to be adopted by the community – in which case they cease
by deﬁnition to be ‘nonce’ (forms used ‘for the (n)once’), and become neologisms.

non-discrete grammar
The name given to a linguistic model suggested by the
American linguist John Robert Ross (b. 1938) in the early 1970s (as an altern-
ative to the extended standard theory of transformational grammar),
which analyses language as a series of discrete contrasts (e.g. grammatical
v. ungrammatical, applicability v. non-applicability of rules). In non-discrete
grammar, however, such notions as grammaticality, rule applicability, class
membership, etc., are seen as matters of degree. Accounting for the existence
of marginally grammatical sentences, semi-sentences, and so on, is conceived
as a major aim of linguistic theory, and indeterminacy of this kind is seen
as an essential feature of competence. The idiosyncratic terminology which this
model uses (e.g. squish, ‘nouniness’, ‘clausematiness’, etc.) has endeared it to
some, and been a source of irritation to others. Its emphasis on the analysis
of problematic data has been welcomed, but so far there has been relatively
little development of the approach in linguistics as a whole, and its theoretical
signiﬁcance is controversial.

non-linear phonology
In phonology, any model which avoids a linear rep-
resentation of the phonological structure of a word. ‘Linear’, in this context,
refers to a representation of structure as a series of segments occurring in a
strict horizontal sequence, each segment being analysed (vertically) as an
unordered column of features – [s], for example, being [−syllabic], [−voice],
[−nasal], [+coronal], etc. A recognized weakness of these two-dimensional matri-
ces is their inability to handle features which extend over domains greater than
330
non-deﬁnite

an individual segment (e.g. certain properties of tones, vowel harmony);
another is their inability to represent structure relationships (functional or ‘natural’
classes) within columns of features. The result has been the development of
non-linear models, such as Firth’s prosodic phonology (see Firthian), and
(since the 1970s) such models as metrical phonology, autosegmental
phonology and dependency phonology. In these approaches, features which
extend over domains greater than a single segment are taken out of feature
matrices and represented on separate levels (tiers) of their own. There is now a
large class of non-linear models in contemporary phonology.

non-native varieties
A term used in sociolinguistics and foreign-language
teaching, to refer to varieties of a language which have emerged in speech
communities where most of the speakers do not have the language as a mother-
tongue. The notion has been chieﬂy used in the context of English as a world
language, and speciﬁcally in relation to the kind of English which has grown up
in India, Singapore and many of the countries of Africa.

nonsense (n.)
In several contexts in linguistics and phonetics, this term is
used in a rather more restricted sense than in everyday use. In phonetics, it is
applied to the invented phonetic sequences (nonsense words) used as part of
ear-training exercises. In linguistics it refers, ﬁrst, to sentences which may
be generated by a grammar (i.e. they are grammatical), but which are not
semantically acceptable, e.g. *The stone is sleeping, *He drank the car in a
nonsense
331

table. Such meaningless sentences are often called anomalous. The term is also
used in grammar, as part of a technique for testing productivity. Often used
here is an extract from Lewis Carroll’s Jabberwocky, where phrases such as all
mimsy were the borogoves display word-class identities clearly, e.g. mimsy
(adjective) and borogoves (noun). The technique is also used in language acqui-
sition, e.g. in language production tasks, to see if the child has acquired a
grammatical unit (as in the wugs experiment).

norm (n.)
The general sense of this term is used in linguistics to refer to a
standard practice in speech or writing. The ‘norm’ in question may apply to
groups of varying size within a speech community, or to the community as a
whole. For example, several kinds of scientiﬁc English make use of impersonal
constructions much more frequently than is the case in conversational English,
which may be seen as the norm for purposes of stylistic comparison. Often,
the norms of different groups conﬂict, and normative rules may be imposed by
one group on another (e.g. stating the ‘correct’ use of whom, shall or will;
insisting that prepositions should not be used at the end of sentences). A
collection of such rules is known as a normative grammar: such grammars
were particularly current in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and this
332
non-sexist language

tradition still exercises considerable inﬂuence. In contrast with this prescriptive
concern to maintain an imagined set of linguistic standards, linguistics emphas-
izes the description of actual usage in the community, and sociolinguistics
emphasizes the need to take into account the relative appropriateness of
different varieties of language in different situations.
normalization (n.)
A term used in auditory phonetics for a type of com-
pensation made when people are listening to speech, so that they allow for such
variations as changes between speakers or alterations in speech rate. For example,
males and females perceive each other to be using the same set of intonation
patterns, even though the frequency range of their voices is very different.
normative (adj.)

notation (n.)
A term used in linguistics and phonetics to refer to any
system of graphic representation of speech (as in a ‘phonemic notation’,
where the term transcription is widely used). Speciﬁcally, it refers to the set
of symbols which represent a mode of linguistic analysis, as in the ‘phrase-
structure notation’ in generative grammar. An analytic convention, in this
sense, which is introduced into an analysis to facilitate the formulation of a
statement, such as a rule, is often called a notational device, e.g. the use of ( )
to indicate optionality in generative syntax. See also alpha notation, brack-
eting, transcription.
notional (adj.)
A characteristic of much traditional grammatical analysis,
which assumed that there existed extralinguistic categories in terms of which
the units of grammar could be deﬁned. Well-known notional deﬁnitions are
of the noun as the name of a ‘person, place or thing’, of the verb as a ‘doing
word’, of a sentence as a ‘complete thought’, and so on. A grammar which
makes regular use of such deﬁnitions is a notional grammar. linguistics is
critical of the notional approach in so far as the ‘notions’ involved are incapable
of systematic and consistent exposition, and replaces it with an emphasis on
formal criteria.
noun (n.) (n, N)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of words,
traditionally deﬁned as the ‘name of a person, place or thing’, but the vagueness
associated with the notions of ‘name’ and ‘thing’ (e.g. is beauty a thing?) has
led linguistic descriptions to analyse this class in terms of the formal and
functional criteria of syntax and morphology. In linguistic terms, then,
nouns are items which display certain types of inﬂection (e.g. of case or
number), have a speciﬁc distribution (e.g. they may follow prepositions
but not, say, modals), and perform a speciﬁc syntactic function (e.g. as subject
or object of a sentence). Nouns are generally subclassiﬁed into common
and proper types, and analysed in terms of number, gender, case and
countability.
The constructions into which nouns most commonly enter, and of which they
are the head word, are generally called noun phrases (NP) or nominal groups.
The structure of a noun phrase consists minimally of the noun (or noun sub-
stitute, such as a pronoun); the constructions preceding and following the noun
noun
333

are often described under the headings of premodiﬁcation and postmodiﬁcation
respectively. There are many derived notions, including complex NPs, heavy
NPs and NP-movement. Noun incorporation is found in some languages (such
as Iroquoian languages), where a generic noun (e.g. ‘vehicle’) is syntactically
included within a verb, thereby cross-classifying a speciﬁc noun (e.g. ‘car’) that
is governed by the verb. See also collective, incorporation, trace, WH-.

NP-movement (n.)
One of the two major movement processes assumed in
extended standard theory and early government-binding theory, the
other being WH-movement. NP-movement moves a noun phrase from one
argument position to another. It is involved in the formation of passive and
(subject-)raising sentences. What kinds of NP-movement are possible is largely
determined by theta (sub-)theory and binding (sub-)theory, while case
(sub-)theory makes NP-movement obligatory in certain circumstances. The
termn ‘NP-movement’ is often used interchangeably with ‘A-movement’.

Nuclear English
The name of a proposal to adapt the English language to
produce a core system of structure and vocabulary for international use.
Suggested by the British linguist Randolph Quirk (see quirk grammar), it was
presented as a possible solution to problems of communication arising from the
emergence of international varieties of English. Nuclear English would eli-
minate all features that were ‘dispensable’, in the sense that the language has an
alternative means available for their expression (e.g. one of the two indirect
object constructions, or the range of tag questions). A communicative nucleus
would remain, which could be the focus for international purposes.
nuclear predication
see nucleus (2)
nuclear scope
A term used in ﬁle change semantics and related frame-
works, referring to that portion of a logical form corresponding to the scope
of a quantiﬁer, but excluding any clauses indicating a restriction on the
quantiﬁer.
nuclear stress/tone
see nucleus (1)
nucleus (n.) (1)
A term used by some intonation analysts, particularly those
working within the British tradition, to refer to the syllable in a tone unit
which carries maximal prominence, usually due to a major pitch change. The
nuclear syllable (sometimes represented as N) is also referred to as the tonic
syllable. In generative phonology, the analogous notion is nuclear stress,
with the relevant stress-assignment rule referred to as the Nuclear Stress
Rule (NSR). In the normal, unemphatic version of the sentence The lady saw the
dog, the last word is nuclear, and will carry one of the possible nuclear tones in
334
noun incorporation

English. The nuclear tone is the most prominent pitch movement in a tone unit.
In English, analyses of nuclear tones vary, but most recognize such contrasts as
falling (transcribed with ` above or before the syllable in question), rising ´,
rising-falling ˆ, falling-rising ˇ and level ¯. Others are possible, including distinc-
tions within these types, such as ‘high’ v. ‘low’ fall.
(2)
In grammar and semantics, the term is sometimes used to refer to the
essential subject–predicate or NP–VP structure of a simple sentence.
Nuclear predications play a central role in functional grammar.
(3)
In phonology, the sub-constituent of the syllable rhyme consisting of
the head of the syllable and any on- and off-glides.
null (adj.)
An application in generative grammar of the mathematical use
of this term, with the general meaning of empty or zero, as in ‘null subject’
(a phonologically empty constituent, pro) or ‘null element’. In some models of
phonology, a ‘null segment’ is one carrying a full surface speciﬁcation, but
behaving as if it lacks (some or all) feature values. An example is the epenthetic
vowel when this is analysed not as an underlying segment, but as a vowel
inserted late in the derivation, and attached to an empty place-holder.
number (n.) (NUM)
A grammatical category used for the analysis of word-
classes displaying such contrasts as singular (sg, SG, sing), plural (pl, PL), dual
(du) (‘two’), trial (‘three’), paucal (‘few’), etc., as in English boy v. boys, he
walks v. they walk. The contrasts generally correspond to the number of real-
world entities referred to, but linguistic discussion has drawn attention to the
problems involved in proposing any such straightforward one-to-one correla-
tion. A noun, for example, may ‘look’ singular, but refer to a multiplicity of
entities (e.g. the committee are agreed; see collective), and nouns which ‘look’
plural may refer to a single entity (e.g. billiards). There are in addition several
analytical difﬁculties in relating the notion of number to that of countability
(to explain the absence of such forms as *a butter).
numeration (n.)
In the minimalist programme, the set of items taken
from the lexicon for the purpose of building a structural description. The
computational system selects elements from the numeration and combines
them into structures. Numeration deﬁnes a reference set. The most economical
derivation is chosen over the others, but a derivation that results from one
numeration does not compete against a derivation chosen from a different
numeration. In more recent minimalist thinking, numeration has been replaced
by the concept of lexical array.

O
object (n.) (O, Obj, OBJ)
A term used in the analysis of grammatical func-
tions to refer to a major constituent of sentence or clause structure, tradi-
tionally associated with the ‘receiver’ or ‘goal’ of an action, as in The cat bit
the dog. Traditional analysis distinguishes a direct versus an indirect object, to
allow for sentences such as The teacher gave a letter to the girl/The teacher gave
the girl a letter, which is marked in English by a contrast using prepositions
and word-order, and in inﬂecting languages by different cases (typically,
the object case being accusative, the indirect object case being dative). In
generative grammar, the direct object is called simply ‘object’, and contrasted
with indirect object. A further distinction is that between objective genitive (i.e.
the genitive functions as object, as in the writing of the questions = ‘X wrote the
questions’), and ‘subjective genitive’ (i.e. the genitive functions as subject, as in
the shouting of the people = ‘people shout’). Much discussion in linguistics
has focused on clarifying the notion of ‘receiving’ an action, in relation to the
other elements of clause structure (subject, complement, etc.), distinguish-
ing various kinds of verb–object relationship, both in terms of surface and
underlying structure. Examples of problem sentences are John is easy to
please (where John is the underlying object of please) and The plants are selling
well (where in reality it is the plants which are the ‘logical receivers’ of the
action).
In the study of inﬂected languages, objective may be used as an alternative to
accusative; e.g. in English the contrast between subject and object forms of
pronouns (e.g. she ~ her) is sometimes referred to as a distinction between
subjective and objective case. Some linguists talk about the ‘object of a preposi-
tion’ to refer to the noun phrase in around the corner. The term ‘objective’
has a special status in case grammar, where it refers to the semantically most
neutral case, i.e. a noun whose role in the action is identiﬁed by the semantic
interpretation of the verb itself. In government-binding theory, objective
Case is assigned to any noun phrase governed by a transitive verb. See also
applicative, raising.

obligatory (adj.)
A term in linguistics which refers to an element that cannot
be removed from a structure without that structure becoming ungrammatical.
In the sentence I put the pen in the desk, in the desk is an obligatory adverbial.
In early transformational grammar, the term refers to one of the two types
of transformational rule postulated by Noam Chomsky in his book Syntactic
Structures (1957), the other being optional. An obligatory transformation is
one which must apply at a given stage in a derivation, when its structural
description is met, if a well-formed sentence is to result, e.g. the rule which
attaches afﬁxes to their base forms. In later versions of transformational gram-
mar, the range of this notion changes as surface structures come to be derived
from deep structures by obligatory transformations, and the notion of optional
selection comes to be replaced by choices made between the rules of the base
component.
obligatory contour principle (OCP)
In some models of generative phonology,
a principle which disallows adjacent identical elements in a representation.
It was originally proposed for tone languages, where it excluded sequences
of identical adjacent tones (e.g. a sequence of High–High–Low would simplify
to High–Low). The principle was later extended to segmental phonology,
especially in non-linear models, where it disallows any two identical features
or nodes which are adjacent on a given tier. Violations of this principle are
handled through various processes, such as dissimilation or the insertion of an
epenthetic vowel (as in the vowel which separates a sequence of two coronal
sibilants in such English plural forms as buses).
oblique (adj.) (obl, OBL)
In languages which express grammatical relation-
ships by means of inﬂections, this term refers to the form taken by a noun
phrase (often a single noun or pronoun) when it refers collectively to all the
case forms of a word except that of the unmarked case, or nominative.
observational adequacy
see adequacy
observer’s paradox
A methodological problem identiﬁed with reference to socio-
linguistics by William Labov (b. 1927): how can linguists obtain naturalistic
data about speech through observation or interview, given that the presence of
the linguist (whether actively participating in a dialogue or acting as a silent
observer) will exercise an inﬂuence on the way people talk? Several techniques
have since been devised to divert a speaker’s attention away from the fact that
they are being observed, such as by introducing a conversational topic which is
likely to engage the speaker’s full attention.
obsolescence (n.) (1)
In historical linguistics, a term used to describe the
gradual loss of a lexical item because changes in the language or in the
external world eliminate the opportunity or motivation for its use. Examples of
obsolescent words in English would be the terms referring to vehicles from a
obsolescence
337

previous era, such as landau or hansom. These words have not gone completely
out of use, as they will be heard from time to time at vintage rallies and in other
special contexts, but most people would not use them. When a word does go
totally out of general use, it is said to be obsolete – as with comptable and
comradery. See also archaism.
(2)
In sociolinguistics, a term used to describe the gradual loss of a language,
which takes place when its transmission between generations ceases, and the
number of its native speakers diminishes. See also language death.
obsolete (adj.)
see obsolescence (1)
obstruent (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds
to refer to sounds involving a constriction which impedes the ﬂow of air through
nose or mouth, as in plosives, fricatives and affricates. In the distinctive
feature approach of Chomsky and Halle (see Chomskyan), the term is used in
the same sense, but its status is that of phonological opposition to sonorant.
obviative (adj./n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a fourth-person
form used in some languages (e.g. some North American Indian languages).
The obviative form (‘the obviative’) of a pronoun, verb, etc. usually contrasts
with the third person, in that it is used to refer to an entity distinct from that
already referred to by the third-person form – the general sense of ‘someone/
something else’.
occlude (v.)
see occlusion
occlusion (n.)
A term used in phonetics referring to the duration of the closure
which is made while a plosive consonant is being articulated. Plosives are
sometimes referred to as occlusives because an articulator completely closes off
(occludes) the vocal tract at a single place of articulation. clicks are
produced by occluding the vocal tract in two places.
occupational dialect
see dialect
oesophageal (adj.)
A term used in phonetics for sounds or voice initiated at
or below the oesophagus; also spelled esophageal. An oesophageal technique of
voice production is often taught to patients following laryngectomy.
off-glide/on-glide (n.)
Terms used in phonetics to refer to the auditory effect
of articulatory movement at points of transition between sounds. An off-
glide is a movement which occurs as the vocal organs leave the position
taken up by one speech sound and travel towards the position required for the
next sound (or towards a position of rest). An on-glide is the correlative movement
which occurs as the vocal organs approach their target position for the articu-
lation of a sound either from a previous sound, or from the position of rest.
offset (n.)

omega (ωωωωω) (n.)

onomasiology (n.)
A term sometimes used in semantics to refer to the study of
sets of associated concepts in relation to the linguistic forms which designate
them, e.g. the various ways of organizing lexical items conceptually in thesauri.
onomastics (n.)
A branch of semantics which studies the etymology of insti-
tutionalized (‘proper’) names, such as the names of people (‘anthroponymy’ or
‘anthroponomastics’) and places (‘toponymy’ or ‘toponomastics’); also called
onomatology. In a looser usage, ‘onomastics’ is used for personal names and
‘toponymy’ for place names.
onomatology (n.)
see onomastics
onset (n.) (1) (O)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to the
initial functional element in a linguistic unit. The notion has been especially
used in relation to the description of syllable structure, but it is also sometimes
found in other contexts, such as in relation to intonation or rhythm units.
A distinction is sometimes drawn between ‘simple’ syllabic onsets (containing
only one segment) and ‘complex’ onsets (containing more than one segment).
The maximal onset principle (or ‘CV rule’) states that a . . . VCV . . . string is uni-
versally syllabiﬁed as . . . V.CV. . . . In moraic phonology, onsets are thought
not to contribute to syllable weight (unlike rhymes – the notion of ‘onset/rhyme
assymetry’). In optimality theory, the onset constraint requires that all syl-
lables begin with a consonant.
(2)
In phonetics, a term used in the articulatory description of segments,
referring to a phase (the onset phase) at the beginning of a segment during
which the vocal organs are approaching the maximal degree of constriction
(the ‘medial phase’). Onset phase speciﬁcally contrasts with offset phase, which
shows the movement of the vocal organs towards the medial phase of the next
segment.
ontogeny (n.)
The application of this general term in linguistics refers to the
chronological acquisition, development and decay of language in the indi-
vidual, as opposed to in the speech community as a whole (phylogeny); also
referred to as ontogenesis. Ontogenetic notions are particularly encountered in
child language studies.
opacity (n.)
see opaque (1)
opaque (adj.) (1)
A term used in generative phonology to refer to the
extent to which the applications of a given rule to a given form cannot be seen
in the phonetic output at the end of the derivation. The opacity of a rule is
contrasted with its transparency.
(2)
In the context of generative syntax, opaque refers to a set of conditions
specifying the grammatical contexts in which an expression cannot be free.
For example, in the construction They believe [each other are intelligent], each
other is an opaque context, and cannot be co-indexed with an item outside it.
opaque
339

The structure is ill formed because the anaphor each other has to be bound
with its governing category (the embedded tensed clause), but there is no
appropriate NP present to enable this to happen. By contrast, each other is in a
transparent context in They believe [each other to be intelligent]; here, it can be
co-indexed with an NP outside the clause (they).
(3)
In semantics, a (referentially) opaque or intensional context is one in which
the substitution of co-referential terms potentially results in a change of
truth value. For example, John believes that – is happy is an opaque context:
it is possible that John believes that George Bush is happy might be true, even
while John believes that the 43rd president of the USA is happy is false, even
though the terms George Bush and the 43rd president of the USA refer to the
same individual. Contexts in which this sort of substitution cannot result in a
change of truth value are called transparent or extensional.
(4)
A term used in non-linear phonology, as part of the characterization of
the domain within which assimilation rules apply: in long-distance assimila-
tions (such as vowel harmony), intervening consonants are said to be either
opaque or transparent. An ‘opaque’ segment is one already characterized by the
node or feature which is being spread by an assimilation rule, and thus
blocks the application of the rule; a segment which permits the application of a
rule is said to be ‘transparent’.
open (adj.) (1)
A term used in the four-level phonetic classiﬁcation of
vertical tongue movement in vowel sounds based on the cardinal vowel
system, the others being close, ‘half-close’ and ‘half-open’. It refers to a vowel
made with the tongue in the lowest possible position, i.e. the mouth as wide
open as possible, as in [a] and [w]: the most open vowels in English are in words
like cat and cart. The area of articulation immediately above ‘open’ is known as
half-open or mid-open, as in [ε] and [Ñ] (the nearest English vowels being in
words like get and got respectively). In a three-level classiﬁcation of vowel
sounds, the lowest group are known as ‘low’ vowels (as opposed to ‘high’ and
‘mid’).
(2)
Open is used in the classiﬁcation of lip positions, referring to the visual
appearance of the lips when they are held relatively wide apart, but without any
noticeable rounding, as in such sounds as the [w] in part. It is contrasted with
spread, neutral and rounded positions. A similar notion is involved in the
classiﬁcation of jaw settings.
(3)
A term used in the two-way classiﬁcation of syllable structure, referring
to a syllable which ends in a vowel, as opposed to the closed syllable,
which ends in a consonant. This feature is sometimes referred to as a ‘free’
syllable. The open syllable is the ﬁrst syllable type to be productively used by
children, in the early stages of phonological development. It also constitutes a
syllable type (consonant+vowel) which seems to be a universal feature of
language.
(4)
A term sometimes used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of words
to refer to one of two postulated major word-classes in language, the other being
closed. An open class is one whose membership is in principle indeﬁnite or
unlimited. New items are continually being added, as new ideas, inventions, etc.,
emerge. nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are open-class items, whereas
conjunctions, pronouns, etc., are closed. The distinction is not quite as
340
open

clear-cut as it seems, as the class of prepositions in English, for example, is
relatively open (e.g. in accordance with, on account of, and many more), and
within the so-called open classes of words there are several closed subsystems,
e.g. auxiliary verbs. But the contrast between ‘open’ and ‘closed’ is widely
recognized.
(5)
In early language acquisition studies of the two-word stage of grammat-
ical development, the term refers to the variable element in a construction,
the other being referred to as the pivot. For example, in the set daddy there, cat
there, drink there, there is the pivot word (a member of a small, ‘closed’ class),
and daddy , etc., are members of an open class. The distinction is of largely
historical interest today.
(6)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of types of juncture or transition,
referring to the features which help to deﬁne a word boundary, before silence;
also known as ‘plus juncture’. Open juncture is opposed to close juncture; ‘open
transition’ to ‘close transition’.
open class
see open (4), (5)
operation (n.)
In formalized analyses, a term normally used in its general
mathematical sense of a function whose arguments are all drawn from the
same set. In less formal analyses, it is often used more loosely to refer to any
change or process performed on a linguistic representation. For example, in
grammar, the relationship between present and past tense in English can be
described as an operation which adds the sufﬁx -ed to the stem, as in walk⇒
walk+-ed. rules are one kind of formal operation. See also operator (2).
operator (n.) (1)
In formal semantics, a term used in two main ways:
(a) referring to any symbol or expression which can bind a variable, such
as the universal or existential quantiﬁers or the lambda binder (‘variable
binding operators’); (b) referring to any symbol or expression which denotes
an operation (or more loosely, any function), especially if it is a logical
constant.
(2)
In some approaches to English grammar (notably Quirk grammar), the
ﬁrst auxiliary verb to be used in a verb phrase. It is so called because it
performs an operation on the clause, such as marking the change from state-
ment to question. For example, in The cat has been eating, has is the operator
(cf. Has the cat been eating?).
(3)
In role and reference grammar, any of a set of formal items which
govern the behaviour of units in interclausal construction. Examples include
aspect, which affects the verb; modality, which affects the core part of the
clause; and tense, which affects the clause periphery.
(4)
In government-binding theory, a notion that applies to several trans-
formations (e.g. WH-movement, relative clause formulation, tough-movement,
clefting and topicalization) that have properties in common – namely, they
leave a gap and obey the subjacency condition. Because they all involve the
same movement operation, the constructions derived in this way are called
operator constructions.
oppositeness (n.)
see antonymy, complementary, converseness
oppositeness
341

opposition (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to linguistically important
differences between units. The term is used primarily in phonology, where
contrasts between distinctive features of sound, or between the presence and
absence of a feature, are referred to as oppositions. The difference between /p/
and /s/, for example, can be seen as a combination of two oppositions – place
and manner of articulation. One of the ﬁrst attempts to classify the opposi-
tions in this sense was in the Prague School’s theory of distinctive opposi-
tions, as ﬁrst formulated in Nikolai Trubetzkoy’s Principles of Phonology (1939).
The main types of opposition recognized are:
(1)
bilateral v. multilateral: the opposition between English /t/ and /d/, for
example, is bilateral, because these are the only units in the system which are
alveolar/plosive, and they are differentiated by the single feature of voicing;
the opposition between say, /t/ and /v/, however, is multilateral, because there is
more than one parameter of contrast, e.g. /d/ v. /f/.
(2)
proportional v. isolated: the opposition between /f/ and /v/ in English
is proportional, because there are other oppositions in the language which
work in parallel, e.g. /s/ v. /z/, /à/ v. /è/; on the other hand, the opposition
between, say, /v/ and /l/ is isolated – there are no other segments that are
contrasted in this particular way, i.e. voiced labio-dental fricative v. voiced
lateral.
(3)
privative, gradual and equipollent: a privative opposition is a binary one,
where one member is seen as marked by the presence of a feature, which its
opposite member lacks (i.e. it is ‘unmarked’), as in the /p/ v. /b/ distinction in
English; in a gradual opposition, degrees of difference in a language are recog-
nized along a scale of some kind, as in a language with four front vowels /i/,
/e/, /ε/ and /æ/ where (according to Trubetskoy) it would not be desirable
to analyse the four degrees of vowel height in terms of privative pairs, such as
‘high’ v. ‘low’; in an equipollent opposition, the members are seen as logically
equivalent to each other, contrasted neither gradually nor by a binary feature;
e.g. the distinction between /p/ and /k/ cannot be analysed, according to
Trubetskoy, as a difference along a single phonetic continuum, nor can /p/ be
seen as ‘non-velar’, or /k/ as ‘non-bilabial’.
(4)
constant and neutralizable: a constant opposition exists when its members
can occur in all possible positions, e.g. wherever /p/ might be found in a lan-
guage, a contrast with /b/ will also be found; in English, the /t/ v. /d/ distinction
is neutralizable, because in some positions there is no such contrast, the opposi-
tion being realized by the same sound, as when /t/ follows initial /s/, e.g. stick
does not contrast with *sdick.
optative (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in grammatical description, to refer
to a category of mood which expresses a desire, hope, or wish. The optative
mood (‘the optative’) is chieﬂy known from Classical Greek. Optative expres-
sions in English use the modal verbs or the subjunctive: May they get home
safely, Heaven help us!
optimal (adj.)
see optimality theory
optimality theory (OT)
In phonology, a theory developed in the early
1990s concerning the relationship between proposed underlying and output
342
opposition

representations. In this approach, an input representation is associated with
a class of candidate output representations, and various kinds of ﬁlter are used
to evaluate these outputs and select the one which is ‘optimal’ (i.e. most well-
formed). The selection takes place through the use of a set of well-formedness
constraints, ranked in a hierarchy of relevance on a language-particular
basis, so that a lower-ranked constraint may be violated in order to satisfy
a higher-ranked one. The candidate representation which best satisﬁes the
ranked constraint hierarchy is the output form. For example, in English the
negative preﬁx in- (e.g. insufﬁcient) has two output forms, im- before bilabials
(as in impossible, immodest), and in- elsewhere (inarticulate, involuntary, etc.).
The coexistence of these forms means that there is conﬂict between the class
of faithfulness constraints (which require identity between input and output)
and the class of constraints which impose restrictions on possible sequences
of sounds – in this case, a constraint requiring that adjacent consonants
have identical place of articulation – which needs to be resolved by an appro-
priate ranking of the relevant constraints. Optimality theory thus aims to
account for a wide range of phenomena by specifying the interaction of a small
number of universal constraints, which apply variously across languages
in producing phonological representations. A particular constraint may achieve
high ranking in one language (i.e. its output accounts for many surface forms)
and low ranking in another (i.e. its output accounts for only a small class
of forms). Although initially developed in relation to phonology, during
the later 1990s optimality theory came to be extended to morphology and
syntax.
optional (adj.)
A term in linguistics which refers to an element that can be
removed from a structure without that structure becoming ungrammatical.
In the sentence I saw the pen on the desk, on the desk is an optional adverbial.
In early transformational grammar, the term refers to one of two types
of rule postulated by Noam Chomsky in his book Syntactic Structures (1957),
the other being obligatory. Optional transformations may apply at a certain
stage in a derivation; but it is not essential for the well-formedness of the
sentence that they do so, e.g. the transformation from positive to negative,
active to passive, or declarative to interrogative. In later versions of
transformational grammar, the range of this notion changes, as more structural
rules come to be incorporated into the base component of the grammar, and are
thus handled by obligatory rules. A few rules handling stylistic alternatives
remain optional.
oracy (n.)
see oral (2)
oral (adj.) (1)
In phonetics, ‘oral’ is opposed to nasal, referring either to the
articulatory area of the mouth, as in the phrases ‘oral cavity’, ‘oral chamber’,
or to the speciﬁc sounds that are made there. The opposition is usually with
the nasal cavity (and with nasal sounds), but the pharynx, oesophagus and
lungs are also excluded from the notion of ‘oral’. In the distinctive feature
theory of phonology, ‘oral’ is speciﬁcally opposed to ‘nasal’, these being pos-
tulated as two of the contrasts needed in order to specify fully the sound system
of a language. In some models of feature geometry, an ‘oral cavity node’
oral
343

is introduced, corresponding to the articulatory notion of an oral cavity con-
striction. It is represented between the root node and the place node, thus
dominating place and [±continuant] nodes.
(2)
The usual adjective for the manifestation of language in its spoken, as
opposed to its written form. The term oracy has been coined, on analogy with
‘literacy’, to refer to ability in speech and listening comprehension, but this term
is used more in discussion of language skills and curricula in mother-tongue
education, and will not generally be found in technical studies in linguistics
and phonetics.
order (n./v.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the pattern of relationships
constituting or underlying a linear sequence of linguistic units. Sometimes,
no distinction is made between the sequential arrangement of observable formal
elements (deﬁned, for example, in terms of surface structure) and the
abstract pattern of relationships assumed to underlie the surface arrangement:
notions such as ‘word-order’, ‘morpheme order’, ‘subject–verb–object
order’, etc., are often seen in this way. Usually, however, a systematic distinction
is made between these two levels of analysis, the former being referred to as
sequence, and the latter as ‘order’. That there is no necessary one-to-one
correspondence between surface sequence and underlying order can be shown in
such sentences as She took off her hat/She took her hat off/Her hat she took off,
etc., where the same basic subject–verb–object order is realized in different
surface sequences. This notion – that there is an underlying abstract ‘ordering’
of elements from which several surface arrangements can be derived – is a funda-
mental insight of transformational grammar. In this approach, also, the
term ordering is used to refer to the application of the rules of a grammar in
a given succession, a crucial principle which prevents the generation of unac-
ceptable strings, and enables simpler analyses to be made. Several speciﬁc
ordering conventions have been suggested (see the notions of cyclical, linear,
conjunctive, disjunctive, bleeding, feeding, extrinsic and intrinsic
ordering). In natural generative phonology, the no-ordering condition requires
that no extrinsic ordering of rules be permitted. See also bracketing paradox,
rule-ordering paradox.
order of mention
In psycholinguistics, a term referring to a use of language
where the order of events in the outside world is paralleled by the order in the
sequence of semantic units within the utterance. For example: After John shut
the door, he spoke follows order of mention; Before John spoke, he shut the
door does not. See also canonical, order.
ordinal (adj./n.)
A term used in some models of grammatical description
referring to the class of numerals ﬁrst, second, etc. (‘ordinal numbers’ or ‘the
ordinals’), by contrast with the cardinal numbers one, two, etc.

orthoepy /Ñpcθvä}pip/ (n.)
In historical linguistics and philology, an old term
(dating from the seventeenth century) for the study of correct pronunciation and

of the relationship between pronunciation and the writing system. Several works
provide early detailed descriptions of the sounds of contemporary languages.

OT perspective
see input (3)
output (n.) (1)
A use of the general sense of this term in generative grammar
to refer to a sentence which is produced after the application of a rule or set
of rules. It contrasts with input, which refers to the linguistic construct which
triggers the application of a rule.
(2)
In optimality theory, an output is the optimal representation of an
input form, following the application of the mechanisms of the theory. It corre-
sponds most closely to what people actually say. See generator and evaluator.
output–output constraints
In optimality theory, a set of constraints which
mandate paradigmatic uniformity, penalizing related forms that differ in their
phonological properties.
overcorrection (n.)
see hypercorrection
overextension (n.)
A term used in language acquisition studies to refer to
one type of relationship between adult and child meaning, as expressed in
lexical items. In overextension, the child’s lexical item has a wider range of
application than the equivalent term in adult language, e.g. when dog is used
for other animals apart from dogs. The term is usually contrasted with
underextension.
overgeneralization (n.)
A term used in language acquisition studies, referring
to the process whereby children extend their use of a grammatical feature to
contexts beyond those found in the adult language, e.g. when they overgeneralize
the regular past-tense form in such items as *goed, *wented, *goned.
overgeneration (n.)
A term used in generative linguistics to characterize a
rule or a principle which permits ungrammatical structures as well as gram-
matical ones.
overlapping (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology to refer to the possibility that
a phone may be assigned to more than one phoneme (phonemic overlapping).
The notion was introduced by American structural linguists in the 1940s.
The overlapping (or ‘intersection’) of phonemes was said to be ‘partial’ if a
given sound is assigned to phoneme A in one phonetic context and to pho-
neme B in another; it would be ‘complete’ if successive occurrences of the sound
in the same context are assigned sometimes to A, and sometimes to B (compare
the notion of neutralization). An example of partial overlap is found between
/r/ and /t/ in some dialects of English, where both are realized by the tap [Ü]
in different contexts: /r/ ⇒ [Ü] after dental fricatives, as in through; /t/ ⇒ [Ü]
between vowels, as in bitter. An example of complete overlap occurs in the
case of [v], which may stand for most occurrences of English stressed vowels,
when they occur in unstressed positions (e.g. telegraph – telegraphy, where the
ﬁrst and third vowels reduce to [v]).
overlapping
345

The notion of complete overlap was generally rejected, on the grounds that it
would lead to an unacceptable indeterminacy in phonemics which would
destroy the principle of phonemic analysis as an independent level. One would
not be able to tell, on the basis of pronunciation alone, which phoneme a phone
belonged to. The need to preserve some kind of phonemic integrity for success-
ive instances of the same sound led to the maxim ‘Once a phoneme, always a
phoneme’, and to the notion of biuniqueness (or one-to-one correspondence
between phones and phonemes). However, even partial overlap provides consider-
able difﬁculties for the notion of invariance, which is fundamental to the
biuniqueness hypothesis, as has been argued by Noam Chomsky, among others.
It is evident that it is not always possible to predict the phoneme a phone
belongs to, simply by considering its phonetic properties.
(2)
A term used in early language acquisition studies to refer to one type of
relationship between adult and child meaning, as expressed in lexical items.
Overlapping meanings, or overlap, as the name suggests, occur when the mean-
ing of a lexical item for the child is not identical with that for the adult (see
overextension and underextension). In cases of no overlap (‘mismatch’), a
child’s lexical item has no point of contact at all with the meaning of that item
in the adult language, e.g. one child used door to mean ‘walk’. The term is now
of largely historical interest.
overt (adj.) (1)
A term used in linguistic analysis to refer to the relationships
between linguistic forms which are observable in the surface structure of
a sentence; opposed to covert. Examples of overt relations include word-
order, concord and phonotactic sequence. The term is also sometimes
used of elements (e.g. an ‘overt subject’ in pro-drop languages) and processes
(e.g. WH-movement).
(2)
A term used in sociolinguistics as part of the analysis of the way linguistic
forms carry social prestige: in overt prestige, forms are valued which follow the
norms recommended by powerful groups or institutions within society (such as
public schools, broadcasting institutions and usage manuals). An example would
be the forms associated with Standard English. This kind of prestige is overt
because the forms are openly and publicly recognized as socially desirable. An
opposition is drawn with covert prestige, where vernacular dialect forms
are positively valued, emphasizing local solidarity and identity. See also change
from above.

P
palatal (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds on
the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made when
the front of the tongue is in contact with or approaches the hard palate.
Slavic languages usually illustrate a range of palatal sounds; in German, ich (‘I’)
exempliﬁes a voiceless palatal [ç]; in English, palatal sounds are heard only in
restricted contexts, as variants of a phoneme, e.g. /k/ is normally described as
velar, but the k in such words as keep is often quite palatal in its articulation,
because of the inﬂuence of the following front vowel. One may also hear
palatal glides in such words as cute [kj-] or huge [ç]. ‘Palatal’ is sometimes
used with reference to vowels or semi-vowels articulated in the hard-palate
area (front close vowels), as in the [ip] of seat or the initial sound of yet [‡],
formerly [j]; but the commoner use is in relation to consonants.
Palatalization is a general term referring to any articulation involving a move-
ment of the tongue towards the hard palate. It may be used to describe the
altered articulation illustrated by k above, but its more common use is in rela-
tion to secondary articulations. Here, the primary place of articulation is
elsewhere in the mouth; for example, a [t] sound, normally made in alveolar
position, is said to be palatalized if during its articulation the front of the tongue
is raised towards the hard palate: in the case of [t], the palatalization would be
most noticeable when the plosive was released, as a palatal glide would then be
heard before the onset of the next main sound. Several languages, such as
Russian, have sets of palatalized consonants operating as phonemes. Because of
the auditory effect involved, the labels soft and hard are often used to describe
the contrasting qualities of palatalized and non-palatalized consonants respect-
ively. (These labels have no relation to their use in the terms ‘hard palate’ and
‘soft palate’, which are anatomically based: see palate.) In phonetic transcrip-
tion, there are several ways of representing palatalization; for instance [Z], [o],
[tj] and [t’] have all been used to represent a palatalized [t]. See also -ise/-ize.
palate (n.)
The arched bony structure which forms the roof of the mouth, and
which is much used for the articulation of speech sounds. The delimitation
and classiﬁcation of the palatal area has not been without controversy, as is
shown by the several different classiﬁcatory systems for describing the types of
pathological condition known as cleft lip and palate. In one such system, the

whole of the upper oral area (including lips and alveolum) is referred to as
palatal, on the grounds that this constituted a single embryological process. In
phonetics, a much more restricted sense is used: here, the term applies to the
whole area from behind the alveolar ridge to the uvula. It is divided into two
parts: the hard palate, which is the immobile bony area immediately behind the
alveolar ridge, and the soft palate or ‘velum’, which is the mobile ﬂeshy continua-
tion of this, culminating in the uvula. Only sounds articulated in the area of the
hard palate are called ‘palatal’ sounds; soft-palate sounds are either velar or
uvular. The soft palate is particularly important in the production of speech, as
it is under muscular control which enables it to be raised (closing the upper part
of the pharynx) for the production of oral sounds, or lowered (keeping the
passage to the nose open) for the production of nasal sounds. Poor control of
the soft palate (which may result from several neurological or anatomical condi-
tions, such as cleft palate) leads to abnormal nasal resonance or friction.
palato-alveolar (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant
sounds on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made
by a double movement of the tongue towards the area between the alveolar
ridge and hard palate: the blade of the tongue (or the tip and blade together)
makes contact with the alveolar ridge, while the front of the tongue is raised
in the direction of the hard palate. Examples in English are the sh- [à] of ship
and the -s- [è] of treasure. Several other varieties of sound may be articulated in
this part of the mouth by slightly varying the position and shape of the tongue,
e.g. alveo(lo)-palatal sounds, which are important in some languages, such
as Polish.
palatograph (n.)
An instrument used in articulatory phonetics to study
articulations made against the palate. Palatography has used several techniques
to produce accurate pictures of tongue contact with the palate – palatograms.
An early palatographic technique involved spraying the roof of the mouth with
a dark powdery substance; an articulation would then be made, which, if in the
palatal or alveolar area, would rub off some of the substance: the roof of the
mouth would then be photographed to pinpoint the place of articulation. Apart
from the inconvenience of this method, its biggest drawback is that it was static:
it disallowed any observation of the movement of the tongue in connected
speech. More recently, electropalatographic techniques have been devised
which enable a continuous record to be made of the tongue contact in this area.
pandialectal (adj.)
A term used primarily in dialectology and sociolin-
guistics to characterize any linguistic feature, rule, etc., which is applicable
to all the dialects of a language.
panlectal (adj.)
A term used by some sociolinguists to refer to a general
model of grammar within which all individual varieties (or lects) can be
interrelated, thus providing a model of a speaker’s passive competence. A
somewhat less ambitious undertaking is known as a polylectal grammar.
paradigmatic (adj.) (1)
A basic term in linguistics to describe the set of
substitutional relationships a linguistic unit has with other units in a speciﬁc
348
palato-alveolar

context. Paradigmatic relations can be established at all levels of analysis, e.g.
the selection of /p-/ as opposed to /b-/, /n-/, etc., in the context /-it/, or of the as
opposed to a, this, much, etc., in the context – cake. Paradigmatic relations,
together with syntagmatic relations, constitute the statement of a linguistic
unit’s identity within the language system. classes of paradigmatically related
elements are often referred to as systems, e.g. the ‘pronoun system’, ‘case
system’. A set of grammatically conditioned forms all derived from a single
root or stem is called a paradigm.
(2)
In psycholinguistics, the term is used to refer to a class of associative
responses which people make when hearing a stimulus word, viz. those which
fall into the same word-class as the stimulus. A paradigmatic response or asso-
ciation would be girl following boy, white following black, etc. The syntagmatic
association, by contrast, involves a change of word-class in the response. See also
syntagmatic (2).
paradox (n.)
see bracketing paradox, observer’s paradox, rule-ordering
paradox
paragrammatism (n.)
see agrammatism
paralanguage (n.)
A term used in suprasegmental phonology to refer to
variations in tone of voice which seem to be less systematic than prosodic
features (especially intonation and stress). Examples of paralinguistic fea-
tures would include the controlled use of breathy or creaky voice, spasmodic
features (such as giggling while speaking), and the use of secondary articula-
tion (such as lip-rounding or nasalization) to produce a tone of voice
signalling attitude, social role, or some other language-speciﬁc meaning. Some
analysts broaden the deﬁnition of paralanguage to include kinesic features;
some exclude paralinguistic features from linguistic analysis.
parallel distributed processing
see connectionism
parameter (n.) (1)
A term used in government-binding theory for a speci-
ﬁcation of the types of variation that a principle of grammar manifests among
different languages. It is suggested that there are no rules of grammar in the
traditional sense, but only principles which can take a slightly different form
in different languages. For example, a head parameter speciﬁes the positions
of heads within phrases (e.g. head-ﬁrst in English, head-last in Japanese). The
adjacency parameter of case theory speciﬁes whether case assigners must be
adjacent to their noun phrases (e.g. to the left in English, to the right in
Chinese). The pro-drop (or ‘null subject’) parameter determines whether the
subject of a clause can be suppressed. Determining the parametric values for
given languages is known as parameter-setting. The overall approach has been
called the principles and parameters theory (PPT) of universal grammar, and
has since come to be applied outside of syntactic contexts, notably in charac-
terizing phonological relations. Later versions of metrical phonology,
for example, recognize a series of parameters governing the way metrical feet
should be represented, such as quantity sensitivity and directionality. See
also head.

See parametric phonetics.
parametric phonetics
An approach to phonetics which sees speech as a single
physiological system, in which the range of articulatory variables (or para-
meters) in the vocal tract is seen as being continually in operation, interacting
in various ways along the time dimension to produce a continuum of sound
which listeners segment according to the rules of their language. It thus
contrasts with the traditional view of speech, where articulation is seen in
advance as a sequence of speech ‘postures’, or segments, each of which is inde-
pendently deﬁnable with reference to a set of isolatable features (places of
articulation, manner of articulation, etc.). This ‘static’ model contrasts
with the dynamic parametric model, which has led to fresh interest in the
nature of neurolinguistic control mechanisms.
paraphrase (n.)
A term used in linguistics for the result or process of produc-
ing alternative versions of a sentence or text without changing the meaning.
One sentence may have several paraphrases, e.g. The dog is eating a bone, A
bone is being eaten by the dog, It’s the dog who is eating a bone, and so on.
Most semantic theories would treat all these sentences as having a single
semantic representation (though variations in focus and presupposition
could differentiate them). Linguists use syntactic paraphrase as a major procedure
for establishing certain types of transformational relations.
parasite vowel
see anaptyxis
parasitic gap
A term in later generative grammar for a syntactic gap in a
sentence which is possible only because the sentence contains an ordinary gap;
it is therefore dependent or ‘parasitic’ upon the ordinary gap. The following
example involves a parasitic gap, indicated by p, and an ordinary gap, indicated
by e: Which ﬁlm did he criticize e without seeing p? The parasitic gap is possible
only because the ordinary gap is present; hence, the following is ungrammatical:
*He criticized Henry V without seeing p.
paratactic (adj.)
A term used in traditional grammatical analysis, and
often found in descriptive linguistic studies, to refer to constructions of
equal status (co-ordination) which are linked solely through juxtaposition and
punctuation/intonation. ‘Paratactic constructions’ are opposed to hypotactic
ones, where a subordinate relationship is expressed. Parataxis is illustrated by
She bought tea, coffee, eggs, milk or I came; I saw; I conquered.
paratone (n.)
A term occasionally used in phonology for a coherent
formal sequence of intonation units, analogous to the concept of ‘paragraph’
in writing.

parole (n.) /pacr∞l/
A French term introduced into linguistics by Ferdinand
de Saussure (see Saussurean), to distinguish one of the senses of the word
350
parametric phonetics

‘language’ (the others being langage and langue). It refers to the concrete
utterances produced by individual speakers in actual situations, and is distin-
guished from langue, which is the collective language system of a speech
community. An analogous term is performance.
paronymy (n.)
A term sometimes used in semantic analysis to refer to the
relationship between words derived from the same root. It is especially applied
to a word formed from a word in another language with only a slight change:
French pont and Latin pons are paronyms, and the relationship between them is
one of paronymy.
parse (n./v.), parser (n.)
see parsing
parse tree
see tree (1)
parsing (n.) (1)
In traditional grammar, this term refers to the pedagogical
exercise of labelling the grammatical elements of single sentences, e.g. subject,
predicate, past tense, noun, verb; in the USA, also called diagramming.
linguistics, by contrast, is less concerned with labels, and more with the
criteria of analysis which lead to the identiﬁcation of these elements, and with
the way in which speakers use these elements to relate sentences in the language
as a whole.
(2)
Modern grammatical formalisms have begun to develop the properties
of several parsing mechanisms (parsers), and the notion of parsing has proved
to be central to work in computational linguistics, especially natural
language processing.
(3)
The term parse identiﬁes a central feature of the procedures of network
grammars, where it refers to the grammatical breakdown of a text (a ‘parse’)
in terms of syntactic, semantic and referential information, as presented in
the form of a parse tree.

See chart parser.
part (n.)
In syntax, an abbreviation sometimes used for the category particle.
partial assimilation

partial conversion

participant role (1)
A term used in linguistics, especially in pragmatics, to
refer to the functions which can be ascribed to people taking part in a linguistic
interaction. Typical roles are speaker and addressee, but several other roles
can be recognized, such as the recipient (as opposed to the target) of a message,
or the message’s source (as opposed to its speaker).
(2)
The term is also sometimes used in grammar, as an alternative to case, to
refer to the semantic functions attached to clause elements, such as agent,
recipient and affected. See semantic role.
participle (n.) (P, part, PART)
A traditional grammatical term referring to
a word derived from a verb and used as an adjective, as in a laughing face.
participle
351

The name comes from the way such a word ‘participates’ in the characteristics
of both verb and adjective. It is thus distinct from the traditional notion of
gerund, where a word derived from a verb is used as a noun, as in smoking is
forbidden. In linguistics the term is generally restricted to the non-ﬁnite
forms of verbs other than the inﬁnitive, viz. present and past, as in I am going
and I have walked respectively, but, even here, there is a strong tendency to
avoid the use of the traditional labels ‘present’ and ‘past’ participles, with their
Latinate associations of time (inapplicable, for example, in a passive sentence
like I shall be kicked, where the participle can hardly be ‘past’), and to use
instead a neutral set of terms, such as -ing forms or -ED/-EN forms.
particle (n.) (part, PART, Prt, PRT) (1)
A term used in grammatical descrip-
tion to refer to an invariable item with grammatical function, especially one
which does not readily ﬁt into a standard classiﬁcation of parts of speech. In
English, for example, the marker of the inﬁnitive, to, is often called a particle
because, despite its surface similarity to a preposition, it really has nothing in
common with it. Likewise, the unique characteristics of not have prompted
some to label it a ‘negative particle’, and the units in phrasal verbs are often
called ‘verbal particles’.
(2)
A term used in tagmemic analysis to refer to a linguistic unit seen as a
discrete entity, deﬁnable in terms of features. It is contrasted with wave
(where the unit’s contextual variability is analysed) and ﬁeld (where its
distribution is described).
(3)
See particle phonology.
particle phonology
An approach to phonology which focuses on the analysis
of the internal structure of phonological segments. For example, in the analysis
of vowels, three privative features (particles) are recognized – [a] representing
openness, [i] representing frontness, and [u] representing rounding – and
segments are seen to be composed of one or more particles. An [e] vowel, for
example, would be analysed as a combination of [i] + [a]. The approach is
similar to that used in dependency phonology, though differences include
the number of primitives recognized and the treatment of vowel height. The
approach claims to have advantages in the handling of such processes as assimi-
lation and the relationship between monophthongs and diphthongs.
partitive (adj./n.) (part, PART)
A term used in grammar and semantics to
refer to a part or quantity, such as piece, ounce, and bar (of soap). Some
partitive forms (‘partitives’) are very general in meaning, occurring with almost
any quantiﬁable lexical item (e.g. some); others are restricted to a single lexical
item, or to a very small set (e.g. blade – of grass).
part of speech
The traditional term for a grammatical class of words.
The main ‘parts of speech’ recognized by most school grammars derive from
the work of the ancient Greek and Roman grammarians, primarily the noun,
pronoun, verb, adverb, adjective, preposition, conjunction and inter-
jection, with article, participle and others often added. Because of the
inexplicitness with which these terms were traditionally deﬁned (e.g. the use
of unclear notional criteria), and the restricted nature of their deﬁnitions
352
particle

(reﬂecting the characteristics of Latin or Greek), linguists tend to prefer such
terms as word-class or form-class, where the grouping is based on formal
criteria of a more universally applicable kind.
passive (n.) (1) (pass, PASS)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of
voice, referring to a sentence, clause or verb form where the grammatical
subject is typically the recipient or ‘goal’ of the action denoted by the verb,
e.g. The letter was written by a doctor. It is contrasted with active, and some-
times with other forms, e.g. ‘middle’ (as in Greek). A full linguistic statement of
the constraints affecting these relationships is a complex matter. In English,
for example, there are active sentences that do not have passive counterparts
(e.g. The boy fell, They have a car), passive sentences which have an unclear
active counterpart (e.g. The house was sold), and so on. In addition, there is
the problem that the central type of passive construction (using the verb to be,
e.g. She was pushed) is closely related to other types of construction (cf. She
got pushed, She was interested), and a boundary line is sometimes difﬁcult
to establish. Constructions such as Plums are selling well are sometimes
described as pseudo-passives. Constructions such as They were interested in
history, which have both verbal and adjectival properties, are sometimes called
semi-passives. Passive constructions which take an agent are agentive passives
(e.g. She was chased (by the dog)), as opposed to ‘non-agentive’ or ‘agentless’
passives, where there is no need for (and sometimes no possibility of) an agentive
phrase being added, since the speaker does not have a ‘performer’ of the action
in mind (e.g. The city is industrialized now). In generative grammar, the
transformation of a sentence from its active to its passive form is known as
passivization. A verb or sentence which undergoes such a process is said to
passivize.

past anterior
In grammar, a tense form used in some languages to express
the rapid completion of a past action. In French, for example, it is chieﬂy used
instead of the pluperfect in past narrative after time conjuctions or when
the main verb is in the past historic. It is formed by combining the past
historic tense of an auxiliary verb with the past participle of a lexical verb:
Dès qu’elle eut mangé, elle sortit ‘As soon as she had eaten, she left’.
past deﬁnite
see past historic
past historic
In grammar, a past-tense form of a verb, used in some languages
to refer to a completed action; also sometimes called the past deﬁnite. In French,
for example, it is used in the written language as part of past narrative
description as well as in the reporting of completed past events: Hier, Marie se
leva et sortit ‘Yesterday, Marie got up and went out’.
past participle

past perfect

past tense
In grammar, a tense form which refers to a time of action prior
to the moment of utterance. Languages make different distinctions within
this period, such as whether the reference is recent or distant, or whether the
action is completed or not. French, for example, recognizes imperfect, past
historic, perfect, pluperfect, and past anterior tenses, as well as future
and conditional perfect forms. A range of past tenses is also traditionally
recognized in English grammar, following the inﬂuence of Latin descriptive
models, though only a single past-tense form is represented inﬂectionally
(I walked), often called the simple past or preterite; other past time reference
uses auxiliary verbs (I have walked) and past time adverbials (yesterday,
last year).
path (n.) (1)
A term used in generative grammar referring to an unbroken
series of branches and nodes moving in a single direction with respect to the
top of a tree diagram. The term is also used by some linguists as part of the
grammatical analysis of a sentence: an entity takes a path from a source to a
goal, e.g. in John rowed along the river, along is ‘path’. See also network
grammar.
(2)
In a windows model of coarticulation, the term refers to the connection
made between individual windows, representing articulatory or acoustic
variation over time in a speciﬁc context; also referred to as a contour.
pathology (n.)
see language pathology
patient (n.) (P)
A term used by some linguists as part of the grammatical
analysis of a sentence: it refers to the entity which is affected by the action of
the verb, e.g. The dog bit the man. goal and recipient have been used as
alternative terms. See semantic role.
pattern (n.)
In the general sense of ‘a systematic arrangement of units’, this
term is found in linguistics and phonetics, without any special implication.
Certain theoretical implications may be added in some contexts, however. For
example, in language teaching, pattern drills (or ‘structure drills’) refer to the
use of a substitution-frame technique for the practice of a particular struc-
ture. Also, in phonology, the term has been used to refer speciﬁcally to any
neatness of arrangement that can be demonstrated in a sound system – a unit
such as a phoneme being seen as a point in a pattern of sound relationships.
It is felt that a phonemic pattern ought to be regular and symmetrical, and
that the demonstration of pattern congruity in an analysis is a desirable feature.
Whether a sound cluster should be analysed as one phoneme or two, for example,
may depend on the parallel patterns that can be demonstrated between this
cluster and other phonemes; e.g. English /Ä/ and /u/ on this criterion would
be analysed as single phonemes, as a stop+fricative analysis would receive
little support elsewhere in the system. The phrase gap/hole in the pattern is
often used to refer to a lacuna which spoils the symmetry of an analysis, as
when a series of unrounded vowels might have a corresponding series of
rounded vowels except for one case (see gap).

paucal (adj.)
see number
pause (n.)
The general sense of this term applies in linguistics, phonetics
and psycholinguistics, where an attempt is made to give a precise account of
the types and distribution of pausal phenomena and to draw conclusions
concerning their function in speech. A distinction has been drawn between
silent pauses and ﬁlled pauses (e.g. ah, er), and several functions of pause have
been established, e.g. for breathing, to mark grammatical boundaries, and to
provide time for the planning of new material. Pauses which have a structural
function (juncture pauses) are distinguished from those involved in hesitation
(hesitation pauses). Investigations of pausal phenomena have been particularly
relevant in relation to developing a theory of speech production. In gram-
mar, the notion of potential pause is sometimes used as a technique for estab-
lishing the word units in a language – pauses being more likely at word
boundaries than within words.
paycheck sentence
In semantics, a sentence containing a pro-form which is
not co-referential with its antecedent, because the antecedent itself contains
a pro-form. A typical example (from which the term derives) is illustrated by
The man who gave his paycheck to his wife was wiser than the one who gave
it to his mistress. Paycheck sentences provide the primary evidence for ‘lazy
pronouns’ (see pronoun).
peace linguistics
In linguistics, a term reﬂecting the climate of opinion which
emerged during the 1990s among many linguists and language teachers, in
which linguistic principles, methods, ﬁndings and applications were seen as a
means of promoting peace and human rights at a global level. The approach
emphasizes the value of language diversity and multilingualism, both interna-
tionally and intranationally, and asserts the need to foster language attitudes
which respect the dignity of individual speakers and speech communities.
peak (adj./n.)
In phonetics and phonology, a term used to characterize
a relatively high level of prominence; opposed to valley or trough. In metrical
grid theory, peaks (v. troughs) are rhythm prominences. A trochaic rhythm
starts with a left-edge peak or a right-edge trough; an iambic rhythm starts
with a left-edge trough or a right-edge peak. In optimality theory, the peak
constraint requires that syllables have a vowel. See also sonority, syllable.

In some approaches to intonational phonology,
in the analysis of boundary tones, a symbol which shows that a tone asso-
ciates with the edge syllable of a phrase (H%, L%).

In sociolinguistics, a symbol sometimes used to indicate variation in
acceptability because of dialect or idiolect, as in %I might could do that.

perception (n.)
The general sense of this term is found in psycholinguistics,
where it refers to the process of receiving and decoding spoken, written or
signed input. The underlying process is one of matching a set of cues to a stored
representation. In phonetics, the perceptual process requires that listeners take
into account not only the acoustic cues present in the speech signal, but also
their own knowledge of the sound patterns of their language, in order to
interpret what they hear. The term is usually contrasted with production.
Perceptual (= data-driven) processes are often contrasted with conceptual (=
knowledge-driven) processes.
percolation (n.)
In grammar, a process whereby a feature associated with the
head of a construction comes to be associated with the construction as a
whole; also called trickling. It has come to be used chieﬂy in generative
morphology for the analysis of words in terms of heads. For example, in a
word like goodness, it is the -ness afﬁx which gives noun status to the word as
a whole (not the other constituent, good, which is adjectival). The afﬁx
therefore has to be seen as the head and assigned to the noun category. As
a consequence, this category has to percolate through to the word as a
whole (analogous to the way that a head noun in a phrase confers noun phrase
status on the whole phrase). Various feature percolation conventions have
been proposed.
perfect (adj./n.) (perf, PERF, PF)
A term used in the grammatical description
of verb forms, referring to a contrast of a temporal or durative kind, and thus
sometimes handled under the heading of tense (e.g. ‘perfect’, ‘future perfect’,
‘pluperfect’) and sometimes under aspect (e.g. ‘perfective’, ‘non-perfective’). It
is illustrated in English by the contrast between I go and I have gone, or
between I have gone and I had gone (traditionally called the pluperfect, also
now past perfect). linguists prefer an aspectual analysis here, because of the
complex interaction of durational, completive and temporal features of meaning
involved; traditional grammars, however, refer simply to ‘perfect tense’, etc.,
and thus imply a meaning which is to some degree an oversimpliﬁcation. ‘Per-
fect’, in these contexts, refers to a past situation where the event is seen as
having some present relevance; in perfective aspect, by contrast, a situation is
seen as a whole, regardless of the time contrasts which may be a part of it.
Perfective then contrasts with imperfective or non-perfective, which draws atten-
tion to the internal time-structuring of the situation. The terminological distinction
between ‘perfect’ and ‘perfective’ is often blurred, because grammarians writing
on English have often used the latter term to replace the former, presumably
because they wish to avoid its traditional associations. But this can lead to
confusion in the discussion of those languages (such as the Slavic languages)
where both notions are required. In such languages as Russian and Polish, for
example, a contrast between perfective and imperfective is fundamental to verb
classiﬁcation, and is formally marked morphologically. For example, the
preﬁx προ- (‘pro-’) before the verb ‘read’ produces a ‘perfective verb’ where the
meaning is that the action (of reading) is completed; in the ‘imperfective verb’,
which lacks the preﬁx, there is no such implication.

performance (n.) (1)
A term used in linguistic theory, and especially in gen-
erative grammar, to refer to language seen as a set of speciﬁc utterances
produced by native-speakers, as encountered in a corpus; analogous to the
Saussurean concept of parole. It is opposed, in this sense, to the idealized
conception of language known as competence. The utterances of performance
will contain features irrelevant to the abstract rule system, such as hesitations
and unﬁnished structures, arising from the various psychological and social
difﬁculties acting upon the speaker (e.g. lapses of memory), or from biological
limitations (such as pauses being introduced through the need to breathe).
These features must be discounted in a grammar of the language, which deals
with the systematic process of sentence construction. The possible implica-
tion of this view, that performance features are unimportant, came to be
strongly criticized, and the factors which contribute to performance grammars
are now of considerable interest, especially in psycholinguistics. See also
grammar (5).
(2)
A technique used in phonetics whereby aspiring practitioners of the subject
are trained to control the use of their vocal organs so as to be able to produce
the whole range of human speech sounds. The correlative technique of discrimin-
ating and identifying sounds is known as ear-training.
performative (adj./n.)
A term used by the philosopher J. L. Austin (1911–60),
and now found in grammatical and semantic analysis, to refer to a type of
sentence where an action is ‘performed’ by virtue of the sentence having been
uttered, e.g. I apologize, I baptize you . . . , I promise . . . The original distinction
was drawn between performative utterances and constative utterances: the
latter are descriptive statements which can be analysed in terms of truth-values;
performatives, on the other hand, are expressions of activity which are not
analysable in truth-value terms. Performative verbs (apologize, etc.) have a par-
ticular signiﬁcance in speech-act theory, as they mark the illocutionary force
of an utterance in an explicit way. Some transformational analysts have even
proposed a ‘performative analysis’ of sentences, such that a performative verb
is present in underlying structure, e.g. an underlying (deletable) verb such as
‘I assert that . . .’; but the advantages of adopting such a procedure have still to
be fully explored.
period (n.)
A term derived from the study of the physics of sound, and used
in acoustic phonetics, referring to the time it takes for a cycle of pressure
variation in a sound wave to repeat itself. The shorter the period, the more
cycles there will be in a given unit of time, and thus the higher the frequency.
Waveforms which show a repeating pattern of vibration are periodic waves;
those which do not are aperiodic. Speech makes use of both types of waveform:
vowel sounds have periodic waveforms; fricatives, for example, involve
aperiodic waveforms.
periodicity (n.)
A term used in metrical phonology for the repetition of
elements in a metrical grid. For example, in the grid for the car returned, the
bottom-level elements occur four times (the – car – re – turned) and the elements
periodicity
357

at the next level, higher in the grid, occur twice (car – turned). The notion thus
has relevance for accounts of a speaker’s sense of an utterance’s rhythmical
structure.
peripheral (adj.) (1)
An application of the general sense of this term in linguis-
tics, to refer to units or processes which operate at the margins (periphery)
of a structure or within a representation. For example, extrametricality
is restricted to the peripheral elements in a string, and several kinds of edge
phenomena have been noted. The term has a particular application in some
phonological studies of Australian Aboriginal languages, where it refers to
articulations made at the front or back of the mouth (as distinct from
apical and laminal articulations), and is thus equivalent to non-coronal.
(2)
In role and reference grammar, a term used to identify one of the
two basic concepts used in analysing clause structure; opposed to core. The
peripheral layer contains a range of optional adjunctival elements.
periphrasis (n.)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to the use
of separate words instead of inﬂections to express the same grammatical
relationship. In English, for example, the comparison of adjectives involves
both inﬂection (e.g. happier, happiest) and periphrasis (e.g. more happy, most
happy – the periphrastic forms), though most adjectives use only one or other of
these possibilities (cf. *more big, *interestinger).
perlocutionary (adj.)
A term used in the theory of speech acts to refer to
an act performed by making an utterance which intrinsically involves an effect
on the behaviour, beliefs, feelings, etc., of a listener. Examples of perlocutionary
acts include frightening, insulting and persuading. A distinction may be drawn
between the intended and the actual perlocutionary effect of an utterance (e.g. a
speaker may intend to persuade X to do Y, but instead succeed in getting X to
do Z). Perlocutionary acts are distinguished from locutionary acts (which are
mere acts of saying, or uttering words with sense and reference), as well as from
illocutionary acts (which are deﬁned without intrinsic reference to their effect
on a listener), although a single utterance might involve all three kinds of act.
permutation (n.)
A term often used within the framework of transforma-
tional grammar to refer to a basic kind of transformational operation. ‘Per-
mutation transformations’ have the effect of moving constituents (usually
one at a time) from one part of a phrase-marker to another, as in the formation
of passive sentences. An alternative term is movement or reordering. In
some approaches this notion is broken down into the more basic operations of
adjunction and substitution.
perseveration (n.)
A term used by some psycholinguists to refer to a type of
tongue-slip where an earlier linguistic unit is carried over, as when stop the
car might become stop the star.
perseverative/perseveratory coarticulation
see coarticulation
person (n.) (per, PER)
A category used in grammatical description to indic-
ate the number and nature of the participants in a situation. The contrasts are
358
peripheral

deictic, i.e. refer directly to features of the situation of utterance. Distinctions
of person are usually marked in the verb and/or in the associated pronouns
(personal pronouns). Usually a three-way contrast is found: ﬁrst person, in
which speakers refer to themselves, or to a group usually including themselves
(e.g. I, we); second person, in which speakers typically refer to the person they
are addressing (e.g. you); and third person, in which other people, animals,
things, etc. are referred to (e.g. he, she, it, they). Other formal distinctions may
be made in languages, such as ‘inclusive’ v. ‘exclusive’ we (e.g. speaker, hearer
and others v. speaker and others, but not hearer); formal (or ‘honoriﬁc’) v.
informal (or ‘intimate’), e.g. French vous v. tu; male v. female; deﬁnite v. inde-
ﬁnite (cf. one in English); and so on. There are also several stylistically restricted
uses, as in the ‘royal’ and authorial uses of we. Other word-classes than personal
pronouns may show person distinction, as with the reﬂexive and possessive
pronouns in English (myself, etc., my, etc.). Verb constructions which lack
person contrast, usually appearing in the third person, are called impersonal. An
obviative contrast may also be recognized.

p-ﬁx (n.)
In the demisyllabic analysis of syllables, an optional afﬁx attached
to the left of a syllabic core; also called a preﬁx. The point of division between
preﬁx and core is shown notationally by a dot.
phantom segment
see ghost segment
pharyngeal (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant
sounds on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound
made in the pharynx, the tubular cavity which constitutes the throat above the
larynx. Pharyngeal consonants occur in Arabic, for example. They do not
occur as speech sounds in English, but similar effects can be heard in stage
whispers, as when hey, said forcefully in a whisper, is produced with a pharyn-
geal ‘rasp’. The general term pharyngealization refers to any articulation invol-
ving a constriction of the pharynx. A pharyngealized [s], for example, is a
secondary articulation produced by simultaneously constricting the pharynx
while making the [s] articulation; the auditory result would be a sound with a
somewhat central and husky resonance (transcribed [p]). Pharyngealized sounds
are transcribed with [~] placed through the letter. See also guttural, -ise/-ize.
pharynx (n.)
see pharyngeal
phase (n.) (1)
A term used by some grammarians to refer to the contrast
between perfect and non-perfect in the verb phrase (of English, in the ﬁrst
instance). The term is intended to distinguish these forms from the progressive/
non-progressive contrast within aspect, and also from contrasts of tense and
voice.
(2)
In articulatory phonetics, phase refers to a stage within the articula-
tion of a segment. Typically, there is an onset phase, as an active articulator
approaches the point of maximal constriction of the vocal tract; a medial
phase, where the articulation is reached and maintained; and an offset phase,
phase
359

during which the vocal organs move towards their next articulation, overlap-
ping with the onset phase of that sound.
(3)
In acoustic phonetics, phase is part of the description of the waveforms
that constitute speech. A ‘wave’ is a disturbance from equilibrium which propa-
gates in time from one place to another. Speech waveforms can be decomposed
into a number of waves of a regularly repeating kind (‘sine waves’), described
with reference to their amplitude, frequency and time. When sine waves start
at different degrees of displacement from the source, they are said to display
differences in phase.
(4)
In the minimalist programme, a phase is a unit in a derivation that
operates as an independent piece of syntactic structure. The derivation of a
sentence takes place phase by phase, and syntactic operations apply to phases as
wholes and not to parts of them (apart from elements operating at phase edges).
Once it is complete, it is transferred to phonetic form and logical form, and
thus becomes inaccessible for further operations (the phase impenetrability con-
dition). The notion of phase is similar to that of cycle in earlier transforma-
tional grammar.
phatic communion
A term introduced by the anthropologist Bronislaw
Malinowski (1884–1942) and used subsequently by many linguists to refer
to language used for establishing an atmosphere or maintaining social con-
tact rather than for exchanging information or ideas (e.g. comments on the
weather, or enquiries about health). Phatic language (or the phatic function of
language) is of particular relevance to the sociolinguistic analysis of linguistic
functions.
phi features (ϕϕϕϕϕ)
A term used in government-binding theory and the
minimalist programme for grammatical features such as person, number,
gender and case. For example, AGR (see agreement) can be described as a set
of phi features.
philology (n.)
The traditional term for the study of language history, as
carried on by comparative philologists since the late eighteenth century. The
study of literary texts is also sometimes included within the term (though not in
Britain), as is the study of texts as part of cultural, political, etc., research.
philosophical linguistics
A little-developed branch of linguistics which studies,
on the one hand, the role of language in relation to the understanding and
elucidation of philosophical concepts, and, on the other hand, the philosophical
status of linguistic theories, methods and observations. When these topics are
studied by philosophers, rather than linguists, the terms linguistic philosophy
and the philosophy of language are used. When the term ‘philosophical’ is used
in association with the various ﬁelds of linguistic enquiry, a contrast is usually
intended with ‘linguistic’, e.g. ‘philosophical grammar’ (i.e. notional, as
opposed to descriptive grammar), ‘philosophical semantics’ (which includes
such matters as the truth and validity of propositions, normally taken for
granted by linguistic semantics).

phonaesthetics (n.)
A term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to the study
of the aesthetic properties of sound, especially the sound symbolism attribut-
able to individual sounds; also (especially in US English) spelled phonesthetics
here and in related forms. Cases such as the [ip] vowels in a language signalling
smallness (cf. teeny, weeny, etc.) have been suggested as evidence for a limited
sound/meaning correspondence in language (phonaesthesia or synaesthesia),
the sound units concerned being referred to as ‘phonaesthemes’. The branch
of stylistics which studies such expressive effects (e.g. the onomatopoeia of
poetry) is known as phonostylistics.
phonation (n.)
A general term used in phonetics to refer to any vocal activity
in the larynx whose role is one neither of initiation nor of articulation.
The various kinds of vocal-fold vibration (voicing) are the main phonatory
activities, and the study of phonation types is aimed at accounting for the
various laryngeal possibilities, such as breathy and creaky voice. Some phone-
ticians would also include under this heading the modiﬁcations in phonation
which stem from variations in the length, thickness and tension of the vocal
folds, as displayed in the various registers of speech (e.g. falsetto, soprano).
See also articulatory setting.
phonatory setting
see articulatory setting
phone (n.)
A term used in phonetics to refer to the smallest perceptible
discrete segment of sound in a stream of speech (phonic continuum or phonic
substance). From the viewpoint of segmental phonology, phones are the
physical realization of phonemes; phonic varieties of a phoneme are referred
to as allophones.
phonematic unit
One of the two analytic categories used in the Firthian
theory of prosodic phonology, the other being the prosody. Phonematic
units comprise consonants and vowels, occurring in linear sequence, which
cannot be handled in terms of prosodies. Despite the resemblance of the term to
phoneme, the two terms are conceptually quite different, as no attempt is made
with this unit to analyse speech totally into a single system of phonological
oppositions, valid for all places in structure (as is the case with the phoneme),
and some features which would be included in a phonemic analysis would not
be included in an analysis into phonematic features (e.g. lip-rounding).
phoneme (n.)
The minimal unit in the sound system of a language, according
to traditional phonological theories. The original motivation for the concept
stemmed from the concern to establish patterns of organization within the inde-
ﬁnitely large range of sounds heard in languages. The phonetic speciﬁcations of
the sounds (or phones) heard in speech, it was realized, contain far more detail
than is needed to identify the way languages make contrasts in meaning. The
notion of the phoneme allowed linguists to group together sets of phonetically
similar phones as variants, or ‘members’, of the same underlying unit. The
phones were said to be realizations of the phonemes, and the variants were
referred to as allophones of the phonemes (see allo-). Each language can be
shown to operate with a relatively small number of phonemes; some languages
phoneme
361

have as few as ﬁfteen phonemes; others as many as eighty. An analysis in these
terms will display a language’s phonemic inventory/structure/system. No two
languages have the same phonemic system.
Sounds are considered to be members of the same phoneme if they are phonet-
ically similar, and do not occur in the same environment (i.e. they are in
complementary distribution) – or, if they do, the substitution of one sound
for the other does not cause a change in meaning (i.e. they are in free vari-
ation). A sound is considered ‘phonemic’, on the other hand, if its substitution
in a word does cause a change in meaning. In a phonemic transcription, only the
phonemes are given symbols (compared with phonetic transcriptions, where
different degrees of allophonic detail are introduced, depending on one’s pur-
pose). Phonemic symbols are written between oblique brackets, compared with
square brackets used for phonetic transcriptions; e.g. the phoneme /d/ has the
allophones [d] (i.e. an alveolar voiced variant), [!] (i.e. an alveolar devoiced
variant), [:] (i.e. a dental variant) in various complementary positions in English
words. Putting this another way, it is not possible to ﬁnd a pair of words in
English which contrast in meaning solely on account of the difference between
these features (though such contrasts may exist in other languages). The emphasis
on transcription found in early phonemic studies is summarized in the subtitle of
one book on the subject: ‘a technique for reducing languages to writing’. The
extent to which the relationship between the phonemes and the graphemes of a
language is regular is called the ‘phoneme–grapheme correspondence’.
On this general basis, several approaches to phonemic analysis, or phonemics,
have developed. The Prague School deﬁned the phoneme as a bundle of
abstract distinctive features, or oppositions between sounds (such as voic-
ing, nasality), an approach which was developed later by Jakobson and Halle
(see Jakobsonian), and generative phonology. The approach of the British
phonetician Daniel Jones (1881–1967) viewed the phoneme as a ‘family’ of related
sounds, and not as oppositions. American linguists in the 1940s also emphasized
the phonetic reality of phonemes, in their concern to devise procedures of
analysis, paying particular attention to the distribution of sounds in an
utterance. Apart from the question of deﬁnition, if the view is taken that all
aspects of the sound system of a language can be analysed in terms of phonemes
– that is, the suprasegmental as well as the segmental features – then ‘phone-
mics’ becomes equivalent to phonology (= phonemic phonology). This view was
particularly common in later developments of the American structuralist tradi-
tion of linguistic analysis, where linguists adopting this ‘phonemic principle’
were called phonemicists. Many phonologists, however (particularly in the British
tradition), prefer not to analyse suprasegmental features in terms of phonemes,
and have developed approaches which do without the phoneme altogether (‘non-
phonemic phonology’, as in prosodic and distinctive feature theories).
The term phonemic clause has been used primarily in psycholinguistic
research into the distribution and function of pauses: it refers to a grammat-
ical structure produced within a single intonation contour, and bounded by
junctures. The term phonemic tier is often used in autosegmental phono-
logy for the tier containing segments speciﬁed for the features that identify
consonants and vowels (other than [±syllabic], which is speciﬁed on the
skeletal tier); also called the segmental tier. See also autonomous (2), merger,
zero.

phoneme

phonemoid (n.)
A term sometimes used in phonetics to refer to a transcrip-
tion in which the symbols (capital letters within slashes) represent units that
differ in particular ways from traditional conceptions of the phoneme. Typically,
the symbols represent acoustically based similarities across different languages
in, for example, syllable-ﬁnal nasals and laterals or vowel and consonant
lengthening. The archiphoneme might also be described as a phonemoidal
construct.
phonestheme, phonesthesia, phonesthetics (n.)

phonetically consistent form (PCF)
In some studies of child language acquisi-
tion, a vocalization which is recognizable, recurrent and apparently meaning-
ful, but which does not seem to equate with a word in the adult language; also
called a proto-word or (less commonly) vocable. As the term suggests, phonet-
ically consistent forms have articulatory stability, but they are none the less
phonetically less well controlled than words. Their meanings may also not be
referential, but relate to social activities or emotional states.
phonetic alphabet

phonetic form (PF)
A term used in government-binding theory for the
output of the phonological component of a grammar, or the phonological
component itself; also called phonological form. The term is given a revised status
in the minimalist programme, where it is also referred to as the ‘articulatory–
perceptual interface’.

phonetician (n.)
see phonetics
phonetics (n.)
The science which studies the characteristics of human sound-
making, especially those sounds used in speech, and provides methods for
their description, classiﬁcation and transcription. Three branches of the
subject are generally recognized: (a) articulatory phonetics is the study of
the way speech sounds are made (‘articulated’) by the vocal organs; (b) acoustic
phonetics studies the physical properties of speech sound, as transmitted
between mouth and ear; (c) auditory phonetics studies the perceptual response
to speech sounds, as mediated by ear, auditory nerve and brain. The term
instrumental phonetics is used for the study of any of these aspects of the sub-
ject using physical apparatus, such as devices for measuring airﬂow, or for
analysing sound waves. People engaged in the study of phonetics are known
as phoneticians.
Phonetic categories are generally deﬁned using terms which have their origins in
other subjects, such as anatomy, physiology and acoustics. consonant sounds,
for example, are described with reference to anatomical place of articulation
(as in dental, palatal, etc.), or to their physical structure (the frequency
and amplitude characteristics of the sound waves). Because these methods of
analysis are equally valid for all human speech sounds, regardless of the language
or speaker, the subject is often referred to as general phonetics. This term also
phonetics
363

reﬂects the aim of the phonetician to discover universal principles governing the
nature and use of speech sounds. Experimental phonetics is another term which
reﬂects the general nature of this ‘pure’ scientiﬁc endeavour.
Work in phonetics can, accordingly, be classiﬁed into two broad types:
(a) general studies of the articulation, acoustics or perception of speech, and
(b) studies of the phonetic properties of speciﬁc languages. In this latter sense,
it is evident that a further dimension will be required, in order to study how
the sounds are used within the pronunciation system of a language. This
‘functional’ approach to phonetics is usually carried on under the heading of
phonology. However, in so far as phoneticians have a speciﬁc interest in the
study of individual (groups of) languages or dialects, it might then be argued
that phonetics is a branch of linguistics.
It is this twofold character of phonetic enquiry which gives rise to a difﬁculty:
is phonetics an autonomous subject, or is it to be seen as a branch of linguistics?
In terms of methods, it is certainly very different, and phonetic research of type
(a) above often has little to do with the aims of linguistic analysis. But phonetic
research of type (b) is plainly part of linguistic enquiry – some would say, an
indispensable foundation. Depending on their traditions, emphases and aims,
then, some university departments have been called ‘Departments of Linguis-
tics’, some have been called ‘Departments of Linguistics and Phonetics’ – a
distinction which should not be taken to mean that phonetics is not taught in
the former! One compromise has been to talk of the ‘linguistic sciences’ – that
is, linguistics and phonetics.

phonic (adj.)

phonic substance
A term used by some phoneticians and linguists to refer to
speech seen as a set of physically deﬁnable acoustic, articulatory or audit-
ory properties. The importance of this notion is that it constitutes an empirical
datum to which theories of language must ultimately relate. To be plausible,
an account of the English sound system, for example, needs to correlate well
with the phonetic facts (as deﬁned in acoustic, articulatory or auditory terms);
and ‘phonic’ (or ‘phonetic’) substance is a convenient label to summarize this
physical level of investigation. The analogous term for the written language is
graphic substance. See also phone.
phonogram (n.)
In the study of writing systems, a symbol representing a speech
sound; a contrast is intended with the logogram, where symbols represent
words. Any writing system which represents individual speech sounds (as in the
alphabet and syllabary) is a phonography.

phonological scaling
An abstract account of phonology which aims to deter-
mine automatically, on the basis of a universal strength scale, the behaviour of
segments or segment classes in all possible structural positions.
phonological space
A term used in phonology to refer to a theoretical space
in which a system of phonological contrasts can be thought to operate. For
example, changes affecting a vowel system (such as the English Great Vowel
Shift) can be conceived of as operating in a space where such relations as ‘above’
and ‘below’ or ‘in front of’ and ‘behind’ are phonologically relevant.
phonologization (n.)
A term used in historical phonology for a process whereby
sounds which were formerly allophones develop a contrastive status (become
phonemic) through the loss of their conditioning environments.
phonology (n.)
A branch of linguistics which studies the sound systems of
languages. Out of the very wide range of sounds the human vocal apparatus
can produce, and which are studied by phonetics, only a relatively small number
are used distinctively in any one language. The sounds are organized into a
system of contrasts, which are analysed in terms of phonemes, distinctive
features or other such phonological units, according to the theory used. The
aim of phonology is to demonstrate the patterns of distinctive sound found in a
language, and to make as general statements as possible about the nature of
sound systems in the languages of the world. Putting this another way, phono-
logy is concerned with the range and function of sounds in speciﬁc languages
(and often therefore referred to as ‘functional phonetics’), and with the rules
which can be written to show the types of phonetic relationships that relate
and contrast words and other linguistic units. The student of phonology is known
as a phonologist. The term has also been applied to the study of analogous
contrastivity in sign languages (see sign (2)).
In linguistic theories, phonology is seen in one of two main ways: (a) as a
level of linguistic organization, contrasted with the levels of phonetics,
grammar and semantics in the ﬁrst instance, (b) as a component of a gen-
erative grammar (the phonological component), contrasted with various other
components (e.g. syntactic/semantic in early generative grammar; covert in
the minimalist programme). Within phonology, two branches of study are
usually recognized: segmental and suprasegmental. Segmental phonology
analyses speech into discrete segments, such as phonemes; suprasegmental or
non-segmental phonology analyses those features which extend over more than
one segment, such as intonation contours. Another distinction is made between
diachronic and synchronic phonology, the former studying patterns of sound
change in the history of language, the latter studying sound patterns regardless
of the processes of historical change. Experimental phonology aims to integrate
research in experimental phonetics, experimental psychology and phonological
theory to provide a hypothesis-based investigation of phonological phenomena
(of the kind which is standard in the experimental sciences).
The history of phonology is largely taken up with the development of ideas
concerning the phoneme, as originally propounded in Prague School and
Bloomﬁeldian phonological theory, and the subsequent alternative views
proposed, especially in generative phonology (GP) and prosodic phonology,
phonology
365

both of which reject the concept of the phoneme. In prosodic phonology, the
notions of phonematic unit and prosody are proposed. In early versions
of generative phonology, different levels of representation (such as the
systematic phonemic and the systematic phonetic) are recognized, and an
autonomous phonemic level rejected. The purpose of the phonological compon-
ent of a generative grammar is to take the output of the syntactic component
and interpret it phonetically, making reference only to the surface-structure
properties of the formatives involved. These surface-structure properties
include a speciﬁcation of the segmental (vowel/consonant) structure of the
formatives (which comes from the lexicon), and a speciﬁcation of the syntac-
tic features involved (which comes from the syntactic rules). The phonolo-
gical rules of the component apply to the segmental representation, using the
principle of the transformational cycle. At the end of this cycle, all the
brackets marking structure have been removed, stresses have been assigned,
and the resulting string of elements is represented as a set of phonetic segments
(deﬁned in terms of distinctive features). The ﬁrst book-length exposition
of generative phonology, and the standard model for the 1970–80 period, was
The Sound Pattern of English by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle (1968),
often referred to as SPE, and in this dictionary as ‘Chomsky and Halle’.
Later phonological theory has been much taken up with the question of how
far phonological rules can be explained in synchronic phonetic (typically,
articulatory) terms, and how far other constraints (e.g. of a syntactic,
morphological or historical kind) require explanations involving more abstract
notions. Earlier models of ‘abstract’ phonology, which presented solutions invol-
ving underlying forms that are not realized on the phonetic surface, are thus
opposed to models which are more ‘concrete’ in character. Several alternatives to
traditional generative phonology have been proposed. For example, natural phono-
logy (NP) stresses the importance of natural processes – a set of universal,
obligatory, inviolable rules which govern the phonology of a language. They
are said to be ‘natural’ because they are phonetically plausible, in terms of the
properties of the vocal tract, as evidenced by their tendency to appear similarly
in a wide range of languages. Natural phonological processes are held to be
innate, and represent the constraints which a child has to follow when learning
a language. These constraints disallow the production of all but the simplest
pronunciation patterns in the ﬁrst stages of development; they later have to be
modiﬁed or suppressed, as the child learns to produce more advanced forms. In
this approach, a distinction is drawn with ‘acquired’ rules, which are learned
and language-speciﬁc. See also articulatory phonology, atomic phonology,
autosegmental phonology, dependency phonology, loan, metrical
phonology, particle phonology, plane, prosodic phonology.
phonostylistics (n.)
see stylistics
phonotactics (n.)
A term used in phonology to refer to the sequential
arrangements (or tactic behaviour) of phonological units which occur in a
language – what counts as a phonologically well-formed word. In English, for
example, consonant sequences such as /fs/ and /spm/ do not occur initially
in a word, and there are many restrictions on the possible consonant+vowel
combinations which may occur, e.g. /º/ occurs only after some short vowels /},
366
phonostylistics

æ, Î, ∞/. These ‘sequential constraints’ can be stated in terms of phonotactic
rules. Generative phonotactics is the view that no phonological principles can
refer to morphological structure; any phonological patterns which are sensitive
to morphology (e.g. afﬁxation) are represented only in the morphological com-
ponent of the grammar, not in the phonology. See also taxis.
photoglottograph (n.)
An instrument used in articulatory phonetics for
recording glottal area variation by measuring the amount of light passing through
the glottis. The technique used in photoglottography has also been extended
to studies of glottal adjustments and patterns of vocal fold vibration.
phrasal verb
A type of verb consisting of a sequence of a lexical element plus
one or more particles e.g. come in, get up, look out for. Subtypes may be distin-
guished on syntactic grounds (for instance, the particles may be classiﬁed into
prepositional or adverbial types), and the deﬁnition of ‘phrasal’ varies some-
what within different descriptions. But the overall syntactic and semantic unity of
these sequences is readily demonstrable, using transformational and substitu-
tion criteria (cf. She got up at six/She rose at six/What time did she get up?, etc.).
phrase (n.) (P)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to a single
element of structure typically containing more than one word, and lacking
the subject–predicate structure typical of clauses); abbreviated as P in such
combinations as NP (= noun phrase), PP (= prepositional phrase), etc. Tradi-
tionally, it is seen as part of a structural hierarchy, falling between clause
and word, several types being distinguished, e.g. ‘adverb phrase’ (e.g. very
slowly, . . . ), ‘adjectival phrase’ (e.g. the house, old and derelict, . . . ), ‘prepo-
sitional phrase’ (e.g. in the morning, . . . ). In generative grammar, the term
has a broader function, being used as part of a general characterization of
the initial stage of analysis (phrase-structure grammar, phrase-marker,
projection) and of the analytic units involved (noun phrase, verb phrase). In
government-binding theory, clauses are a special kind of phrase, as CP=S′
and IP=S (‘complementizer phrase’ and ‘inﬂection phrase’ respectively). A dis-
tinction is drawn between lexical phrases, such as NP and VP, which are built
around lexical heads, and functional phrases, such as IP and CP, which are built
around functional heads and which are not required to contain lexical material.

phrase edge prominence constraint
see edge
phrase-marker (n.) (PM)
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to
the structural representation of sentences in terms of a labelled brack-
eting, as assigned by the rules of the grammar. Phrase-markers explicitly
specify the hierarchical structure of sentences, at the various stages of their
derivation, and analyse them into a linear sequence of morphemes, or
formatives. They are usually presented in the form of a tree diagram, but
square brackets are also used.
phrase-structure grammar (PSG)
A type of grammar discussed by Noam
Chomsky in his book Syntactic Structures (1957) as an illustration of a
phrase-structure grammar
367

generative device. Phrase-structure grammars contain rules (PS-rules) which
are capable not only of generating strings of linguistic elements, but also of
providing a constituent analysis of the strings, and hence more information
than ﬁnite-state grammars. They are not, however, as powerful as trans-
formational grammars, as the latter are more capable of displaying certain
types of intuitive relationship between sentences, and may ultimately be
demonstrable as simpler. In a related sense, the phrase-structure component of
a transformational grammar speciﬁes the hierarchical structure of a sentence,
the linear sequence of its constituents, and indirectly (through the notion of
dominance) some types of syntactic relations.
The main difference between the phrase-structure grammars (PSGs) of Chomsky
as opposed to the immediate-constituent analysis of earlier linguists is that
Chomsky’s model is formalized as a system of generative rules, and aims to
avoid the emphasis on discovery procedures characteristic of the earlier
approach. In their original formulation, PSGs took the form of a set of rewrite
rules (with the abbreviations expanded here), such as:
Sentence ⇒ Noun Phrase + Verb Phrase
Verb phrase ⇒ Verb + Noun Phrase
Noun Phrase ⇒ Determiner + Noun
Various distinctions have been made in the classiﬁcation of phrase-structure
grammars, of which the main division is into context-free and context-sensitive
types: a grammar consisting wholly of context-free rules (rules which are of the
form ‘Rewrite X as Y’, i.e. regardless of context) is much less powerful than a
grammar containing context-sensitive rules (rules which are of the form ‘Rewrite
X as Y in the context of Z’). In later linguistic theory several approaches to
syntax were developed which are equivalent to PSGs, but do not employ PS
rules, and are thus able to capture generalizations missed by ordinary PSGs.
Examples include generalized phrase-structure grammar and head-driven
phrase-structure grammar. The minimalist programme introduces a major
simpliﬁcation of the notion (bare phrase structure). See Chomskyan.
phylogeny (n.)
The application of this general term in linguistics refers to the
historical (or diachronic) development and decay of language in speech
communities, or as represented in historical texts; also referred to as phylogenesis.
Phylogenetic study contrasts with ontogeny, for the study of development in
the individual, as carried on in language acquisition.

pictogram (n.)
In the study of writing systems, a term used for a symbol found
in picture writing; also called a pictograph. Pictography is the study of pictorial
systems, or an instance of such a system. The pictograms provide a recognizable
representation of entities as they exist in the world (e.g. wavy lines representing
368
phylogeny

sea). Modern pictograms are widespread, such as those used in present-day road
signs (e.g. crossroads ahead).

pidgin (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to a language with a
markedly reduced grammatical structure, lexicon and stylistic range,
compared with other languages, and which is the native language of no one.
Structures which have been reduced in this way are said to be pidginized. Pidgins
are formed by two mutually unintelligible speech communities attempting to
communicate, each successively approximating to the more obvious features of
the other’s language. Such developments need considerable motivation on the
part of the speakers, and it is therefore not surprising that pidgin languages
ﬂourish in areas of economic development, as in the pidgins based on English,
French, Spanish and Portuguese, in the East and West Indies, Africa and the
Americas (where they were often referred to as trade languages). Some pidgins
have become so useful that they have developed a role as auxiliary languages,
and been given ofﬁcial status by the community (e.g. Tok Pisin). These cases are
called expanded pidgins because of the way they have added extra features to
cope with the needs of the users. Pidgins become creolized when they become
the mother-tongue of a community.
pied piping
A term used in generative linguistics for one of the processes
involved in deriving such sentences as To whom did you turn for help?: the
preposition optionally moves to the front of the clause, following its WH-
noun phrase object – just as, the analogy suggests, the rats in the traditional tale
followed the Pied Piper out of Hamelin. A contrast can be drawn with cases where
the preposition is left behind (stranded), as in Who did you turn to for help?
pitch (n.)
The attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which a sound may be
ordered on a scale from ‘low’ to ‘high’. It is an auditory phonetic feature,
corresponding to some degree with the acoustic feature of frequency, which in
the study of speech is based upon the number of complete cycles of vibration of
the vocal folds. Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), e.g. 440 Hz = 440 cps
(cycles per second). The frequency of a sound can be determined automatically
using a ‘fundamental frequency analyser’, or pitch meter. There is however
no direct or parallel correlation between pitch and frequency: other factors than
frequency may affect our sensation of pitch (measured in units known as mels).
Variations of pitch are more easily produced using voiced sounds, because of
their regular waveform. It is, however, possible to hear pitch contrasts in voice-
less sounds; and even in whispered speech, impressions of falling, rising, etc.,
pitches can be heard, reﬂecting the changing conﬁgurations of the vocal tract.
The linguistic use of pitch is of particular interest to the phonologist, and this
is studied under the headings of intonation and tone. However, the term
pitch accent is used phonologically in the description of languages in which the
distribution of the tones within a word is totally predictable once one has
speciﬁed a particular tonal feature of the word (as in Japanese). The notion has
pitch
369

also been applied to English, where some phonological models analyse intonation
contours as a sequence of one or more pitch accents, each associated with a
stress-prominent syllable in a word.
pitch meter
see pitch
pivot (n.)
A term introduced into language acquisition studies of the 1960s,
to refer to a primitive word-class thought to characterize the early two-word
combinations produced by children. Analysis of these combinations suggested
that children used a few words very frequently, and in a ﬁxed position, e.g. my
daddy, my car, my drink; shoe gone, car gone, etc. These common elements
were seen as ‘pivots’ on which the rest of a sentence (the ‘open-class’ word)
depended, the structure of the whole sentence being seen as either Pivot +
Open or Open + Pivot. This analysis is no longer popular, for several reasons
(e.g. it fails to relate to the analysis of adult grammatical structures, ignores the
semantic structure of such sentences, and seems to apply to only certain types
of sentence in certain children).
place (n.)
One of the main parameters used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of
speech sounds, referring to where in the vocal apparatus a sound is produced.
It is usual to represent this parameter horizontally, though as a result this dimen-
sion does omit some of the variations which can only be identiﬁed transversely,
e.g. whether one or both sides of the tongue is involved in an articulation
(see lateral). The conventionally recognized places or points of articulation
for consonants correspond to main anatomical divisions, viz. labial, labio-
dental, dental, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, glottal,
but other places relative to these are also recognized, such as post-alveolar and
retroﬂex. The analogous traditional classiﬁcation of vowels is made in terms
of auditory criteria, using the horizontal scale of front and back, and the
vertical scale of close and open; but because of the lack of a clear anatomical
correlate it has been less usual to talk about vowels in terms of articulatory
‘places’ or ‘points’, except in a loose way. The notion of place (PL), for both con-
sonants and vowels, has come to the fore in non-linear phonological models,
where a speciﬁc place node may be represented in the feature hierarchy,
and used as a constituent under which consonant and vowel (or vowel-like)
features are organized. For example, some articulator-based models recognize
a place node (with no phonetic content) for constriction location, represented
by C-place for consonants and V-place for vocoids. Some approaches
also characterize segments which lack oral articulatory targets as placeless:
examples would be glottal stop, schwa and [h]. See also gesture.
placeless (adj.)
see place
plain (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle (see
Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to handle
variations in manner of articulation, its opposite being ﬂat or sharp,
depending on the contrast involved. ‘Plain’ is deﬁned articulatorily and acous-
tically: in contrast to ﬂat, it refers to sounds involving a relatively wide mouth
opening, and a relatively strong high-frequency component of the sound spectrum,
370
pitch meter

as in sounds lacking lip-rounding; in contrast to sharp, it refers to sounds
lacking any palatalization feature.
planar phonology
see plane
plane (n.)
A term used for an autonomous dimension of structural representa-
tion in some models of non-linear phonology and morphology. Several
derived notions are found in planar phonology. Planar segregation permits units
to be on separate planes under speciﬁed conditions: for example, consonant
and vowel features can be located on independent phonological planes (so that
the relation of [labial] in a consonant to C-place would deﬁne a different
plane from that of [labial] in a vowel to V-place). Plane (or planar) conﬂation
combines two planes into a single level of representation. Plane copying trans-
fers information from one plane to another.
planning (n.)
see language planning
plasticity (n.)
A term used in phonetics referring to the scope for variation
which exists in an individual’s vocal tract. The physical characteristics of the
tract do not determine the acoustic characteristics of a person’s speech in an
absolute way (as with ﬁngerprints), but only the range within which a particular
parameter is able to vary. For example, the length and mass of the vocal folds
will be a major factor in determining whether a speaker has a naturally creaky
voice, but other factors will allow that speaker to avoid sounding so creaky –
and also allow other speakers to assume a creaky voice in order to sound like
him (as happens routinely with speech impressionists). The plastic nature of the
speech mechanism is a major argument against the view that there are immut-
able cues to speaker identity in the speech signal.
plateauing (n.)
A term used in autosegmental phonology for a type of rule
in which a sequence of high–low–high tones is changed to high–high–high. The
rule applies regardless of whether the sequence appears in the same word or in
separate words.
pleonasm (n.)
see pleonastic
pleonastic (adj.)
A term used in grammar for an element which repeats or
anticipates some other element in a sentence and is thus semantically re-
dundant. The use of it in such sentences as It seems that Mary has left or It’s
raining has sometimes been called a pleonastic pronoun. The use of do as an
empty auxiliary verb (see do-deletion) has been called pleonastic do. The
term is derived from the traditional language of usage criticism, where a pleon-
asm was seen as a species of tautology – the use of more words than is strictly
necessary to convey a particular sense.
plereme (n.) (1)
A term used by some linguists to refer to the minimal
units of meaning in componential semantic analysis – what are often called
‘semantic features’ or ‘semantic components’. In glossematics, the term
refers to the minimal unit of meaningful expression (see morpheme).
plereme
371

(2)
In the study of writing systems, a plereme is a sign which denotes both
meaning and form; opposed to ceneme. Examples of pleremic symbols are
Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters.
plethysmograph (n.) (from Greek plithismos ‘enlargement’)
A device used in
articulatory phonetics to measure lung volume; also called a body plethys-
mograph. The subject is placed in a sealed container with a single mouthpiece
which is closed off following a normal expiration of breath. When the subject
breathes in, the resulting changes in pressure within the lungs and within the
container are calculated. The difference between full and empty lungs can be an
important indicator of disease affecting the ﬂow of air in the vocal tract.
P-level (n.)
see harmonic phonology
plosive (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to a sound made when
a complete closure in the vocal tract is suddenly released; the air pressure
which had built up behind the closure rushes out with an explosive sound, hence
the term. Examples in English are [p, b, t, d, k, ì, ˆ]. Plosion is the term used
to refer to the outwards movement of air upon release. Plosive consonants
are one type of stop consonant. It is also possible, using a different airstream
mechanism than the one which produces an outwards ﬂow of lung air, to
produce plosives (implosives) where the air upon release moves inwards. See
also nasal.
pluperfect (adj./n.)
see perfect
plural (adj./n.)
see number
pluralia tantum /pläcrwpl}a ctantäm/
In grammar, a Latin term (meaning ‘plurals
only’) referring to nouns which are plural in form and have no singular
counterpart, such as English oats or Dutch annalen ‘annals’; the singular form,
plurale tantum is not often used.
pluricentric (adj.)
A term used in sociolinguistics for languages which have
more than one accepted standard. English is a well-known example, with its
American and British (and increasingly other) standard varieties; other examples
include Arabic, French, Spanish and Hindi/Urdu.
plurilingualism (n.)
see multilingual
plurisegmental (adj./n.)
A term used by some phoneticians to refer to a vocal
effect which extends over more than one sound segment in an utterance, such
as an intonation contour. The term suprasegmental is more widely used.
plus juncture
see juncture (1)
pneumotachograph (n.)
In phonetics, an instrument which measures airﬂow
from mouth and nose independently and simultaneously, as part of the technique
372
plethysmograph

of aerometry. In pneumotachography, a face mask is placed over the nose and
mouth, and separate meters monitor the airﬂow, the results being displayed as a
pneumotachogram.
poetic metaphor
see conceptual metaphor
poetics (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the application of linguistic
theory and method to the analysis of poetry. However, some linguists (such as
Roman Jakobson) have given the term a broader interpretation, including within
the ‘poetic function’ of language any aesthetic or creative linguistic use of the
spoken or written medium. See also ethnopoetics, Jakobsonian.
point of speech/reference/the event
see Reichenbachian
polarity (n.) (1)
A term used by some linguists for the system of positive/
negative contrastivity found in a language. The distinction between
‘positive’ and ‘negative polarity’ may be expressed syntactically (e.g. not in
English), morphologically (e.g. happy v. unhappy) or lexically (e.g. high
v. low).
(2)
A term sometimes used in the study of tone languages, referring to cases
where a tone is always opposite that of a preceding or following tone (tonal
polarity).
politeness phenomena
In sociolinguistics and pragmatics, a term which
characterizes linguistic features mediating norms of social behaviour, in relation
to such notions as courtesy, rapport, deference and distance. Such features
include the use of special discourse markers (please), appropriate tones of
voice and acceptable forms of address (e.g. the choice of intimate v. distant
pronouns, or of ﬁrst v. last names).
poly-

polyadic (adj.)
see valency
polygenesis (n.), polygenetic (adj.)
see monogenesis
polylectal (adj.)
A term used by some sociolinguists to refer to a proposed
model of grammar which would account for many of the varieties (lects)
of language used by the individual (and, by extension, in the community as
a whole). The contrast intended is with grammars which ignore regional and
social variations, and which analyse language as if it were in a hypothetical
homogeneous state. A further contrast can be drawn with a panlectal grammar,
in which all varieties would be taken into account.
polymorphemic (adj.)
see morpheme
polysemy (n.)
A term used in semantic analysis to refer to a lexical item
which has a range of different meanings, e.g. plain = ‘clear’, ‘unadorned’,
‘obvious’ . . . ; also called polysemia; opposed to monosemy (or univocality). A
polysemy
373

large proportion of a language’s vocabulary is polysemic (or polysemous). The
theoretical problem for the linguist is how to distinguish polysemy (one form
– several meanings) from homonymy (two lexical items which happen to have
the same phonological form). Several criteria have been suggested, such as
etymology (the antecedents of homonymous items would be formally distinct)
and the closeness of the relationship between the meanings in question (the
meanings of homonymous items would be further apart, or unrelated – cf.
the related sense of plain above with the homonyms plane = ‘carpenter’s tool’
and plane = ‘aeroplane’). But all such criteria involve analytic problems, and
the distinction between polysemy and homonymy thus remains a source of
theoretical discussion in linguistics.
polysyllable (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to a word
consisting of more than one syllable. Polysyllabic or multisyllabic words are
contrasted with monosyllables.
polysynthetic (adj.)
A term which characterizes a type of language some-
times distinguished in comparative linguistics using structural (as opposed
to diachronic) criteria, and focusing on the characteristics of the word:
‘polysynthetic’ or ‘incorporating’ languages demonstrate morphologically
complex, long word forms, as in the constructions typical of many American
Indian languages, and encountered occasionally in English, in coinages such as
anti/dis/establish/ment/arian/ism/s. The term is opposed to synthetic and ana-
lytic type languages. Some linguists, however, prefer to see such constructions
handled as a complex of agglutinative and fusional characteristics, and do
not regard this category of language as typologically distinct. As always in such
classiﬁcations, the categories are not clear-cut: different languages will display
the characteristic of polysynthesis to a greater or lesser degree. The polysynthesis
parameter represents the analysis of polysynthetic forms as a system of predicate–
argument relationships.
polysystemicism (n.)
A term used to identify an approach to linguistic analysis
proposed by J. R. Firth (see Firthian), in which different linguistic systems are
set up at different places in structure, no attempt being made to identify the
systems with each other. The approach has been developed primarily in relation
to phonology, where it is known as prosodic analysis. Polysystemic is opposed
to ‘monosystemic’, as in phonemic theories of phonology, where a single basic
phonological unit is used (the phoneme), and the set of phonemes is seen as
a single system of contrasts, applicable to the analysis and transcription
of linear sequences of speech sounds, regardless of the grammatical or
lexical structures involved. In polysystemicism, on the other hand, different
phonological systems are set up as required at different places in the structure
of syllables, words and other units, and within different areas of the
vocabulary or grammar. There is little emphasis on transcription, and a corres-
pondingly greater emphasis on relating phonology to other levels of linguistic
structure. In this approach, the set of sounds needed to deﬁne the contrastive
possibilities at the beginning of words in a language may be quite different from
those required in the middle or at the end of words. There is little evidence of
the need for this analysis in English (apart from occasional contrasts such as /º/
374
polysyllable

and /h/, which do not occur in the same environments), but several languages,
such as many in South-East Asia, have been fruitfully analysed in these terms.
polyvalent (adj.)
see valency
pooh-pooh theory
The name of one of the speculative theories about the origins
of language: it argues that speech arose through people making instinctive
sounds, caused by pain, anger or other emotions. The main evidence is the use
of interjections, but no language contains many of these. The term has no
standing in contemporary linguistics.
popular etymology
see etymology
portmanteau (adj./n.)
A term used in morphological analysis referring to
cases where a single morph can be analysed into more than one morpheme, as
in French au, aux, etc. (= *à le, *à les, ‘to the’). The item is called a ‘portman-
teau morph’ (‘a portmanteau’), and sometimes, when it is equivalent to a word,
a ‘portmanteau word’.
Port Royal
The name given to a group of seventeenth-century scholars, based
at the convent of Port Royal, south of Versailles, who, following the ideas of
Descartes, developed a view of language in which grammatical categories
and structures were seen as relatable to universal logical patterns of thought
(an inﬂuential work was the Grammaire générale et raisonnée of C. Lancelot,
A. Arnauld and others, published in 1660). The ideas of this school of thought
became widely known in the 1960s, when Noam Chomsky drew certain paral-
lels between them and his own conception of the relationship between language
and mind. See Chomskyan.
position (n.) (1)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the functionally
contrastive places within a linguistic unit, e.g. phonemes within the syllable
or word, morphemes within the word, words within the sentence. It is com-
mon to talk of elements occurring in initial, medial or ﬁnal ‘positions’
within the higher-order unit. A positional variant refers to the formal vari-
ations introduced into a linguistic unit (usually a phoneme or morpheme) because
of the conditioning inﬂuence of its linguistic context. See also argument.
(2)
In phonetics, position refers to the arrangement of the vocal organs
during the articulation of a sound: the various articulators (lips, tongue,
etc.) are said to be in certain positions, according to their place and manner of
articulation.
positional faithfulness/markedness
In optimality theory, an application of
the notions of faithfulness and markedness relative to a particular location
in a form. For example, in a given language plosives may be less marked than
nasals in onsets, while the reverse may be true in codas.
positional mobility
A term often used in grammar to refer to a deﬁning
property of the word, seen as a grammatical unit. The criterion states that
the constituent elements of complex words are not capable of rearrangement
positional mobility
375

(e.g. unsuccessful cannot vary to produce full-un-success, etc.), thus contrasting
with the way words themselves are mobile in sentences, i.e. they can occur in
many contrasting positions.
positive (adj.) (1)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a type
of sentence or verb which has no marker of negation, i.e. it is expressing
an assertion. The positive or afﬁrmative ‘pole’ of this contrast is opposed to
negative, and the grammatical system involved is often referred to under the
heading of polarity.
(2)
The unmarked term in the three-way grammatical description of adject-
ives and adverbs into degrees, specifying the extent of their application. The
positive or ‘absolute’ degree implies no comparative quality, and contrasts with
such terms as comparative and superlative. In English, the adjective with no
formal modiﬁcation is used as the positive form, and this is generally the case
in languages.
positive face

possession (n.)

possessive compound

possessive pronoun

possible-worlds semantics
A version of formal semantics in which sentences
and other expressions may be assigned semantic values not just in relation
to the actual or real world but across a range of abstract representations of
hypothetical states of affairs, or possible worlds. A main aim is to model speakers’
abilities to make distinctions of modality, for example commitments to pos-
sibility, probability and necessity. See intension (2).
post-
A preﬁx used commonly in phonetics and linguistics, referring to
relative position in a sequence; opposed to pre-. In phonetics, it refers to an
articulation a little behind a recognized place of articulation, e.g. ‘post-
alveolar’, ‘post-palatal’. The terms ‘post-vocalic’, ‘post-consonantal’,
however, do not refer to points of articulation, but to sounds occurring in a
speciﬁc syllabic position, viz. after a vowel/consonant respectively. In gram-
mar, the term is found in relation to several contexts, such as postmodiﬁcation,
‘postdeterminer’, ‘post-article’, ‘post-verbal’, etc.
post-alveolar (adj.)
see alveolar
post-aspiration (n.)
see aspiration
post-creole continuum
A term used in sociolinguistics to describe the result
of a standard language exerting an inﬂuence on a creole (where both are
varieties of the same language). People alter their creole speech in the direction
of the standard, and a whole range of varieties emerge, which form a continuum
between the standard and the creole. Terms which have been devised to refer to
376

the post-creoles which form different parts of the continuum include acrolect
(an educated variety very close to the standard), basilect (the variety closest to
the original creole) and mesolect (intermediate varieties).
post-cyclic (adj.)
A term used for a type of rule recognized in the extended
standard theory of transformational grammar, to refer to a type of
transformation which applies after cyclic transformations have been completed;
also called post-cyclical, and contrasted with pre-cyclic(al), where the trans-
formation applies beforehand. Post-cyclic rules are intended to handle such cases
as the combining of tenses with main verbs. See also lexical phonology.
post-dental (adj.)
see dental
postdeterminer (n.)
In grammar, a term used to describe a type of word
which occurs after the determiner and before an adjective in a noun phrase.
Several quantifying words hold this position, such as ﬁrst, other and the numerals
(e.g. the three big chairs, the other leading participants).
post-lexical (adj.)
see lexical phonology
postmodiﬁcation (n.)
A term used in some grammatical descriptions to refer
to all the items which occur after the head of a phrase (an endocentric
phrase), e.g. The cars in the garage are expensive. In English, three main types
of postmodifying structure are recognized: prepositional phrases (e.g. the cars
in the garage . . . ), ﬁnite (relative) clauses (e.g. the car which was in the
garage . . .) and non-ﬁnite (inﬁnitive or participial) clauses, e.g. the car parked
in the street . . . , the car to buy . . . See genitive.
post-nasal (adj.)
see nasal
postposition (n.) (P)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of words,
referring to the closed set of items which follow noun phrases (or single nouns
or pronouns) to form a single constituent of structure. The analogous con-
struction in English involves prepositions. Many languages make regular use
of postposed items, e.g. Japanese, Hindi. The word ago (e.g. two years ago) is
also sometimes classiﬁed as a postposition. See also adposition.
post-structuralism (n.)
see logocentrism
postulate (n.)
An application in linguistics of the general use of this term in
the branch of logic known as axiomatics. It refers to a set of initial proposi-
tions which a theory assumes to be true; these initial statements, and sub-
sequent deductions made from them, are collectively known as the postulational
method (see axiomatic). In linguistics, several ‘sets of postulates’ have been
proposed, in attempts to systematize ideas about language, the best known
being those propounded by the American linguists Leonard Bloomﬁeld (in 1926)
and Bernard Bloch (in 1948). See Bloomﬁeldian.
postures (n.)

postvocalic (adj.)
In phonetics and phonology, a term describing a sound
which follows a vowel. For example, /t/ is postvocalic in the word cat.
‘Postvocalic r’ refers to the use of an r quality after vowels in certain accents
(e.g. in Scotland and most parts of the USA). There is a contrast with prevocalic,
referring to a sound which precedes a vowel – /k/ in the word cat, for example.
Some consonants are restricted to one position or the other: in English
syllables, /h/ occurs only prevocalically, as in hot, and /º/ only postvocalically,
as in sing.
potential lexicon
see potential word
potential pause
A term often used in grammar to refer to a deﬁning property
of the word, seen as a grammatical unit. The criterion states that, in normal
speech, pauses are not introduced within the structure of the word but are
always possible (and often present) at word boundaries.
potential word
In linguistics, a term for any word which can be generated
using the word-formation rules of a language, even though it has not yet been
attested. In English, the attested lexicon includes revision from revise, but not
devision (from devise), which thus remains part of the potential lexicon. Similarly,
slock is a potential word, on phonological grounds, but fnock is not.
poverty of the stimulus
The name given to an argument in language acquisi-
tion, as identiﬁed by Noam Chomsky, that the samples of language available to
a child are insufﬁcient to explain the adult’s knowledge of language (the ‘ﬁnal-
state grammar’); also referred to as ‘Plato’s problem’ or ‘the logical problem
of language acquisition’. The innateness hypothesis is invoked to resolve the
problem. See also Chomskyan, evidence, innateness.
power (n.) (1)
A term used in the formal evaluation of grammars, and par-
ticularly found in discussion of generative theories; also called capacity.
Basically, grammar A would be said to be more powerful than grammar B if it
can generate more languages (sentences, etc.) than B. In this sense, a context-
free grammar is more powerful than a ﬁnite-state grammar. It is important,
however, that a grammar should not become too powerful, in the sense that
it generates sentences which are ungrammatical, structural descriptions which
are intuitively implausible, or a characterization of natural language that is
too broad (e.g. including features of non-language systems). formal constraints
therefore have to be built into grammatical models to restrict the power of
grammars in speciﬁc ways, and much current discussion is focused on this
subject. A further distinction is often introduced, between weak and strong gen-
erative power within a grammar. In the notion of ‘weak’ generative power,
a grammar (or rule, or set of rules, etc.) is said to be more powerful than
another if it generates more grammatical sentences. In the notion of ‘strong’
generative power, a grammar is said to be more powerful if it assigns to these
sentences a set of structural descriptions which more satisfactorily shows
their relationships.

pragmalinguistics (n.)
A term sometimes used within the study of pragmatics,
to refer to the study of language use from the viewpoint of a language’s
structural resources; it contrasts with those pragmatic studies which examine
the conditions on language use which derive from the social situation (some-
times referred to as sociopragmatics). A pragmalinguistic approach might
begin with the pronoun system of a language, and examine the way in which
people choose different forms to express a range of attitudes and relationships
(such as deference and intimacy). The latter approach might begin with the
social backgrounds of the participants in an interaction, and examine the way
in which different factors (such as age, sex, class) lead people to choose particu-
lar pronouns.
pragmatics (n.)
A term traditionally used to label one of the three major divisions
of semiotics (along with semantics and syntactics). In modern linguistics,
it has come to be applied to the study of language from the point of view of
the users, especially of the choices they make, the constraints they encounter
in using language in social interaction, and the effects their use of language has
on the other participants in an act of communication. The ﬁeld focuses on an
‘area’ between semantics, sociolinguistics and extralinguistic context;
but the boundaries with these other domains are as yet incapable of precise
deﬁnition. At present, no coherent pragmatic theory has been achieved, mainly
because of the variety of topics it has to account for – including aspects of
deixis, conversational implicatures, presuppositions, speech acts and dis-
course structure.
Partly as a consequence of the potentially vast scope of the subject, several
conﬂicting deﬁnitions have arisen. In a narrow linguistic view, pragmatics deals
only with those aspects of context which are formally encoded in the struc-
ture of a language; they would be part of a user’s pragmatic competence. At the
opposite extreme, it has been deﬁned as the study of those aspects of meaning
not covered by a semantic theory. In this connection, some semanticists see the
subject as contrasting with truth-conditional semantics: it is suggested that
the difﬁculties which arise in relation to the latter (e.g. how to handle the notion
of presupposition) are more readily explicable with reference to pragmatics.
More inclusively, it has been characterized as the study of the principles and
practice of conversational performance – this including all aspects of language
usage, understanding and appropriateness. Especial attention has been paid
to the range of pragmatic particles which are found in speech (e.g. you know,
I mean, sort of, tag questions) which play an important role in controlling the
pragmatic nature of an interaction.
Several derivative terms have been proposed in order to classify the wide range
of subject-matter involved. Pragmalinguistics has been used by some to refer to
the more linguistic ‘end’ of pragmatics, wherein one studies these matters from
the viewpoint of the structural resources available in a language. Sociopragmatics,
by contrast, studies the way conditions on language use derive from the social
situation. General pragmatics is the study of the principles governing the
communicative use of language, especially as encountered in conversations –
principles which may be studied as putative universals, or restricted to the study
of speciﬁc languages. Literary pragmatics applies pragmatic notions (especially
pragmatics
379

to do with narrative) to the production and reception of literary texts. Applied
pragmatics focuses on problems of interaction that arise in contexts where
successful communication is critical, such as medical interviews, judicial set-
tings, counselling and foreign-language teaching.
Prague School
The name given to the views and methods of the Linguistic
Circle of Prague and the scholars it inﬂuenced. The circle was founded in 1926
by Vilém Mathesius (1882–1946), a professor of English at Caroline University,
and included such linguists as Roman Jakobson (see Jakobsonian) and Nikolai
Trubetskoy (1890–1938). The ‘Praguean’ inﬂuence has been widespread and
long-lasting, as the frequent reference to it throughout this dictionary testiﬁes.
Its main emphasis lay on the analysis of language as a system of function-
ally related units, an emphasis which showed Saussurean inﬂuence. In par-
ticular, it led to the distinction between the phonetic and the phonological
analysis of sounds, the analysis of the phoneme into distinctive features,
and such associated notions as binarity, marking and morphophonemics.
Since the 1950s, Prague School ideas have been received and developed,
particularly with reference to the syntax, semantics and stylistics of English
and Slavonic languages, and illustrated in the work of Josef Vachek (1909–96),
Jan Firbas (1921–2000) and others. Of particular note here is the formulation
of a theory of functional sentence perspective, wherein sentence analysis
is seen as a complex of functionally contrastive constituents. A representative
reader is J. Vachek (ed.), A Prague School Reader in Linguistics (1964), but the
early book by Trubetskoy, Grundzüge der Phonologie (1939), translated in
1969 as Principles of Phonology, is seminal.
pre-
A preﬁx used commonly in phonetics and linguistics, referring to
relative position in a sequence; opposed to post-. In phonetics, it usually refers
to an articulation a little in front of a recognized place of articulation,
e.g. ‘pre-palatal’, ‘pre-velar’. The terms ‘prevocalic’, ‘pre-consonantal’,
however, do not refer to points of articulation, but to sounds occurring in
a speciﬁc syllabic position, viz. before a vowel/consonant respectively;
‘pre-head’ has a similar force within the tone group; ‘pre-aspiration’ and
‘pre-nasalization’ illustrate temporal uses of the term. In linguistics, the term
is found in relation to several grammatical contexts, such as predeterminer,
‘pre-article’, ‘pre-verbal’, pre-lexical, prelinguistic, premodiﬁcation – and,
of course, preposition.
pre-aspiration (n.)
see aspiration
precedence (n.)
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to a type of
relationship between pairs of nodes in a phrase-marker. One node precedes
another when it occurs anywhere to the left of the other in the phrase-marker:
if it occurs immediately to the left of a node X, the node ‘immediately precedes’
X. In generalized phrase-structure grammar, linear precedence rules take
the form X < Y (i.e. X must precede Y). The ‘horizontal’ relationship of preced-
ence should be distinguished from the ‘vertical’ relationship between nodes,
known as dominance. When a node A dominates another node B, neither A
nor B precedes the other.

pre-cyclic(al) (adj.)
see post-cyclic
predeterminer (n.)
A term used in some models of grammatical description,
referring to a class of items which occur before a determiner in the noun
phrase, e.g. all/both/half in all the people, etc.
predicate (n.) (pred) (1)
A term in the analysis of grammatical functions, to
refer to a major constituent of sentence structure, traditionally associated
with a two-part analysis in which all obligatory constituents other than the
subject are considered together. For example, Sue walked/Sue kicked the ball/
Sue went on holiday . . . would all be seen as Subject (Sue) + Predicate construc-
tions. These sentences would also be labelled predicative in a classiﬁcation of
exocentric constructions. There are several points of contact here with the
philosophical analysis of propositions in terms of predication (i.e. properties
being predicated of entities), and linguistic discussion has focused on the extent to
which there are parallels between the syntactic and the semantic dimensions
of analysis (using such distinctions as given/new and topic/comment). Paral-
lels between the syntactic and semantic dimensions of the analysis have been one
of the central areas of interest in government-binding theory. The focus has
been on verbless subject–predicate constructions, as in Martha considers Mary
intelligent. The mainstream analysis involves the assumption that Mary intelli-
gent is a constituent, the so-called small clause. (The category label of this
constituent is a subject of controversy.) A rival analysis (the so-called predica-
tion theory) holds that Mary and intelligent are two separate constituents.
In functional grammar, the term has a central status: here, a predicate is
taken to be the basic element of a predication; it is listed in the lexicon in
the form of a predicate frame, from which nuclear predications are formed
by inserting appropriate terms into the argument positions. Full predications
are then formed from nuclear predications through the use of satellites
(e.g. manner, locative).
At a more detailed level, in syntax, distinctions are sometimes made between
predicative and non-predicative functions of words; e.g. the adjective in the
house is big is predicative, whereas in the big house it is attributive. However,
terminology varies a great deal here, depending on the model of description
used. The term predicator (P) has also been suggested by some theorists to refer
to the verbal element in Subject–Verb–Object constructions, viz. Subject–
Predicator–Object, on the grounds that this avoids using ‘verb’ in both a functional
and a formal sense (cf. ‘a subject may have a noun as its exponent’ with the
undesirability of ‘a verb may have a verb as its exponent’).
(2)
The term is also used in linguistics in a sense derived from logic, particu-
larly when notions from the system of predicate calculus are used in grammatical
or semantic analysis. The predicate calculus, also called predicate logic, is a
system for representing propositions (or sentences, or statements) in formal
notation, with a set of semantic or deductive rules used for proving examples
of logical consequence, logical truth, etc. More powerful than the weaker
system of propositional calculus, predicate calculus addresses certain
aspects of logic which require an analysis of the internal structure of atomic
propositions, and standardly includes an analysis of universal and existen-
tial quantiﬁcation. A predicate is an expression which can combine with a
predicate
381

ﬁxed number of names or other terms to form an atomic proposition, generally
providing information about the referents of those terms, as in The car is stolen/
big/beautiful . . . The predicate may be classed as ‘one-place’, ‘two-place’, etc.,
depending on the number of terms with which it must combine; for example, in
the sentence Jules saw Jim, the verb saw functions as a two-place predicate, the
names Jules and Jim serving as its two arguments. models based on this
system are used in several linguistic theories, especially in formal semantics
and in syntactic theories such as case grammar and dependency grammar.

predication theory
A sub-theory of some versions of government-binding
theory, whose central principle is that a predicate requires a subject. This
accounts for the obligatory occurrence of expletive or dummy it in sentences
like It’s raining and It’s possible that John is ill. Not only verb phrases but
expressions like drunk in John arrived drunk are regarded as predicates in this
context.

preﬁx (n.) (1)
A term used in morphology referring to an afﬁx which is
added initially to a root or stem. The process of preﬁxation (or preﬁxing) is
common in English, for forming new lexical items (e.g. para-, mini-, un-), but
English does not inﬂect words using preﬁxes. Languages which do inﬂect in
this way include German (e.g. the ge- of perfective forms), Greek, and many
American Indian languages (e.g. the Athapaskan family).

pre-lexical (adj.)
A term used in some models of generative grammar
(see Aspects model) to refer to the ﬁrst stage in a two-stage generation of
deep structures. In this stage phrase-markers are generated in which the
terminal nodes are expressed as a ∆ (delta) element. In the second stage,
lexical items are inserted into these positions, in the form of complex
symbols (i.e. ‘lexical transformations’).
prelinguistic (adj.) (1)
In the study of performance models of language, a
term used with reference to hypothetical stages in speech production which
382
predicate calculus

precede those involved with language organization. Psychological factors, such
as cognitive awareness and attention, could be seen as prelinguistic in this sense.
The term is contentious in psycholinguistics.
(2)
In language acquisition, the period immediately preceding the emerg-
ence of linguistic patterning in children’s vocalization is considered a pre-
linguistic stage of development, viz. much of the second half of the ﬁrst year
of life.
prelinguistics (n.)
A term used by some linguists, especially in the 1950s, to
refer to the articulatory and acoustic study of sound, as opposed to the
strictly linguistic studies of phonology, etc. (microlinguistics). In this
frame of reference, it was seen as a branch of macrolinguistics. The term
prelinguistic is sometimes used outside this framework to refer to any construct
which needs to be taken into account as a preliminary consideration before
linguistic analysis proceeds, e.g. the obtaining of adequate data samples.
premodiﬁcation (n.)
A term used in some models of grammatical descrip-
tion to refer to all the items which occur before the head of a phrase (an
endocentric phrase), e.g. All those big red foreign cars have been sold. deter-
miners and adjectives are the main classes which premodify (occur in
premodifying position) in English, but there are several other categories involved
in the full description of this complex area, e.g. quantiﬁers, intensiﬁers.

preposing (n.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to the movement
of a constituent to a position earlier in the sentence, e.g. an adverb is
preposed in Yesterday I bought a bike; a verb is preposed in I thought they’d be
complaining, and complaining they were. See also WH-.
preposition (n.) (P, pr, prep, PREP)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁca-
tion of words, referring to the set of items which typically precede noun
phrases (often single nouns or pronouns), to form a single constituent of
structure. The resulting prepositional phrase (PP) (or prepositional group) can
then be described in terms of distribution (e.g. their use following a noun, as
in the man in the corner) or semantically (e.g. the expression of possession,
direction, place). Prepositional sequences of the type illustrated by in accordance
with are often called complex prepositions. A postposition is a particle,
similar in function to a preposition, which is placed after a noun phrase, as
in Japanese. Many linguists subscribe to a broader view of prepositions. To
form a prepositional phrase, prepositions can combine with not only an NP
but also a PP (e.g. since before breakfast), a clause (e.g. since they ﬁnished
their breakfast) or nothing (e.g. I haven’t seen him since). In this account,
it is possible to talk of ‘transitive’ and ‘intransitive’ prepositions. See also
adposition.
preposition
383

prerequisites (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the concepts on which
an analysis at a speciﬁc linguistic level depends. Its main application is in the
context of phonological procedures, where the American structuralist
view of the 1940s – that phonological analysis should proceed solely on the basis
of phonetic criteria – came to be opposed by a view which stressed the import-
ance of ‘grammatical prerequisites’ – the presuppositions about the identity
of such notions as word and sentence which had to be made before techniques
such as the minimal pair test could be used.
prescriptive (adj.)
A term used by linguists to characterize any approach
which attempts to lay down rules of correctness as to how language should
be used. Using such criteria as purity, logic, history or literary excellence,
prescriptivism aims to preserve imagined standards by insisting on norms of
usage and criticizing departures from these norms. Prescriptive grammars of
English include such recommendations as: I should be used after the verb be,
e.g. It is I; whom should be used as the relative pronoun in object func-
tion, e.g. the man whom I saw; and so on. A distinction is sometimes made
between prescriptive and proscriptive rules, the latter being rules which forbid
rather than command. Linguistics has been generally critical of the prescriptivist
approach, emphasizing instead the importance of descriptively accurate stud-
ies of usage, and of the need to take into account sociolinguistic variation
in explaining attitudes to language. More recently, there has been interest in
studying prescriptivism objectively, as a sociocultural phenomenon. The term
‘prescriptive’ is sometimes used in sociolinguistics (e.g. the prescriptions of a
sociolinguistically realistic language-planning programme), but on the whole the
term is pejorative in linguistic contexts.

prespeciﬁcation (n.)
In prosodic morphology, in the analysis of reduplica-
tions, the name given to a special type of relation between an element on the
melodic tier and template position. Invariant prior linking of a melodic
element to a template position is said to supplant the rule-governed linking of
an element to the same position (i.e. the element has been prespeciﬁed). The
notion is not accepted in all accounts of melodic invariance.
pressure (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle (see
Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, under the
heading of supplementary movements, to handle variations in manner of
articulation. It refers to articulatory movements of the glottis or velum (see
velar) where the airﬂow is directed outwards, as in ejectives. See also stop.
presupposition (n.)
The philosophical uses of this term will be found in seman-
tic discussion: a condition which must be satisﬁed if a particular state of affairs
is to obtain, or (in relation to language) what a speaker assumes in saying a
particular sentence, as opposed to what is actually asserted. It is also analysed
as a certain type of logical relationship between statements, contrasting with
384
prerequisites

entailment. Some linguists have come to use the term in a narrower sense, in
a two-part analysis of sentences which contrasts the information assumed
(or presupposed) by the speaker, and that which is at the centre of the speaker’s
communicative interest; in this sense, ‘presupposition’ is opposed to focus.
(The contrast between given and new information makes an analogous distinc-
tion.) For example, in one interpretation of this notion, the sentence Where’s
the salt? is said to presuppose that the salt is not present to the speaker, that
there is someone whom the speaker thinks might know where the salt is, and
so on. This total study of the factors in the communicative context which
affect the meaning of an utterance has attracted increasing interest from
linguists in recent years, partly in semantics and partly under the heading
of pragmatics. Controversial aspects of analysing language in these terms
abound, in particular over the extent to which the notion of presupposition
can or ought to be restricted to certain kinds of logical or behaviourally demon-
strable factors.
preterite (adj./n.)
A term used especially in traditional grammar, but with
some use in linguistics, to refer to a form of the verb expressing past time
without any aspectual consideration; also called a ‘simple past tense’. A
preterite form (‘the preterite’), such as I spoke, would thus contrast with such
non-preterite forms as I was speaking, I have been speaking, etc.
prevarication (n.)
A suggested deﬁning property of human language (contrast-
ing with the properties of other semiotic systems), referring to the way languages
can be used to misinform, as in lying, irony, etc.

priming (n.)
In psycholinguistics, an effect which alters the time needed to
recognize a target word. The target word is presented, preceded by another
word (the prime). If the prime word is semantically or formally similar to the
target (e.g. decide preceding decision, doctor preceding patient), response times
are faster. If the same word is used as a prime, response times are faster still
(the identity priming effect). Primes can be presented using different modalities
(e.g. spoken or written), statuses (e.g. words or non-words), and time frames (e.g.
masked or unmasked). A masked prime is a prime presented for a very short
period of time, such as 50 ms.
priming
385

primitive (adj./n.)
An application in linguistics and phonetics of the general
use of this term in scientiﬁc investigation, where a construct is taken as ‘given’
by a theory, the purpose of the theoretical exposition being to explicate it;
sometimes called a prime. The propositions which contain such undeﬁned
terms are referred to as postulates or axioms. Examples of terms often taken
as primitive include ‘utterance’, ‘acceptable’, ‘sound’, ‘meaningful’, ‘mouth’,
‘vocalization’, ‘distinctiveness’, etc. – though any of these might become the
focus of controversy in an investigation, and could not thereby be assumed to
have primitive status. The distinction between primitive and non-primitive terms
is of particular importance in attempts to formalize linguistic theory, and has
been much discussed in generative grammar. In early versions of this model,
the terms which appear in the structural descriptions of a sentence are
primitive, e.g. ‘sentence’, ‘noun phrase’, ‘verb phrase’, ‘+’, ‘⇒’ (‘rewrite’);
terms such as subject, object, subordinate, co-ordinate, etc., are derived
or non-primitive. In X-bar theory, noun phrases and verb phrases are not
primitives: NP is a phrase headed by a noun, VP is a phrase headed by a verb,
a noun is deﬁned as [+N, −V], a verb is deﬁned as [−N, +V], and the features N
and V are primitives. In government-binding theory, S is not a primitive,
but an IP. Subject, etc. are derived notions in transformational and phrase-
structure grammars, but primitives in relational and lexical functional
grammars.
principal parts
In grammar, a traditional term referring to the forms of a
verb required to determine which conjugation it belongs to. The notion was
important in Latin grammars, where the principal parts of amo, for example,
included the ﬁrst-person form of the present indicative (amo ‘I love’), the
inﬁnitive amare (‘to love’), the ﬁrst person form of the perfect indicative
(amavi ‘I have loved’), and the ‘supine’ (amatum), which was a type of verbal
noun (‘loving’). Verbs like amo (‘ﬁrst conjugation verbs’) could thus be quickly
distinguished from verbs belonging to other conjugations. The term is not
usually found in modern linguistic analysis, but will be encountered in studies
of linguistic historiography.
principles (n.)
A term used in grammatical theory for grammatical statements
that are much broader in their scope than ordinary rules, such as the projec-
tion principle of government-binding (GB) theory and the foot-feature
principle of generalized phrase-structure grammar. Principles are particu-
larly important in GB, where it has been suggested that there are no rules, in the
traditional sense, but only principles which can take a slightly different form in
different languages. A speciﬁcation of the range of forms that a principle can
take is known as a parameter. The overall approach is known as the principles
and parameters (P&P, PPT) theory of universal grammar, as seen in GB and
the minimalist programme. See also projection.
privative (adj.) (1)
A type of opposition recognized in Prague School pho-
nology, distinguished from gradual and equipollent. A privative opposition
is a binary one, where one member is seen as marked by the presence of a
feature, which its opposite member lacks (i.e. it is ‘unmarked’), as in the /p/ v.
/b/ distinction in English, where the latter is seen as marked for voicing.
386
primitive

(2)
A term used in some models of non-linear phonology, notably under-
speciﬁcation theory, referring to a feature which can take only one value;
also called monovalent and opposed to equipollent. For example, the features
of nasality, aspiration and glottalization have all been proposed as priv-
ative, in that all processes which affect them (e.g. assimilation) refer only to
their [+] values. The extent to which privativity can be applied in the analysis of
other (possibly all) features is a topic in contemporary phonological debate.
privileges of occurrence
A term used in linguistics to refer to the formal
environment in which a linguistic item may be used. Items which share the
same privileges of occurrence belong to the same class, e.g. black, nice, big,
angry, etc., in the context the – dog.
pro (n.)
A term used in government-binding theory for a non-anaphoric
null (phonologically empty) pronominal; known also as little pro, to distin-
guish it from ‘big PRO’ (see following entry). Usually associated with subject
position in ﬁnite clauses in pro-drop languages, it is identiﬁed through the
morphological features present in the sentence.
PRO (n.)
A term used in government-binding theory for a base-generated
subject of certain inﬁnitives; known also as big PRO, to distinguish it from
‘little pro’ (see previous entry). Within the GB classiﬁcation of noun phrases,
PRO is analysed as both a pronominal and an anaphor. It can be controlled
by some NP within a sentence, or have arbitrary reference: the former possibility
is illustrated by John tried PRO to please Mary, where PRO is controlled by
John; and the latter by It is easy PRO to please Mary. Constructions with PRO
are known as control constructions, and are to be distinguished from raising
constructions. Some grammarians refer to both as catenative constructions. In
generalized phrase-structure grammar and lexical functional grammar,
control constructions involve a bare VP and not clauses with a PRO subject.
See also pro-drop.
probe (n.)
In the minimalist programme, a term referring to the head that
triggers move. Probe searches its complement domain, and attracts the closest
constituent with matching features as a goal.

A label given to a type of network grammar which sees
analysis as a set of procedures (i.e. instructions for analysing or building up a
construction) for interpreting what we hear – such as recognizing words in
text, trying them out as parts of constructions, comparing them with conclu-
sions already made, and so on.
procedural semantics
An approach to semantics which models the notion of
sense in terms of a set of mental operations that decide on the applicability of
a lexical item to an entity, state of affairs, etc.
procedure (n.)
A term used in linguistics referring to a particular way
of arriving at a linguistic analysis or decision. Different views about the goals
of a linguistic theory can be clariﬁed by phrasing the question in terms of
procedure
387

procedures, of which three types have attracted particular interest, since their
ﬁrst formulation by Noam Chomsky (see Chomskyan):
(a)
discovery procedure: a technique which can be automatically or ‘me-
chanically’ applied to a sample of language and which would produce a
correct analysis. Attempts to develop such a procedure characterized the work
of many Bloomﬁeldian linguists, and were strongly criticized in early formu-
lations of generative grammar. It is argued that it is never possible to identify
with certainty all the factors which lead a linguist in the direction of a particular
analysis. Nor is it desirable to seek such a procedure, as the analysis itself can be
evaluated regardless of the means by which it was obtained.
(b)
decision procedure: a technique which could be automatically applied to
a series of grammars of a language, to decide which was the best grammar. It is
suggested that such a goal is impossible, in the present state of linguistic know-
ledge, and that linguists must content themselves with relative and not absolute
decisions, as in (c) below.
(c)
evaluation procedure: a technique which provides criteria for choosing the
better of two analyses of a set of data, as when it is argued that one analysis is
simpler, more plausible or more elegant than another. In generative linguistics,
a few (controversial) procedures have been suggested (see simplicity) which
attempt to formalize the properties of alternative descriptions so that precise
evaluations can be made.
process (n.) (1)
Any approach to linguistic description which sees some
elements (structures, etc.) as being the result of a change operating on some
other element in the language. The process of change may be real (as in
attested processes of diachronic change) or part of the abstract system of
relationships found in a particular model of description (as when plural nouns
are derived from singulars by a process of pluralization). This notion is funda-
mental to the item-and-process model of linguistic description, and several
important terms in contemporary linguistics reﬂect a process approach, e.g.
derivation, rewrite rule, blend and the many terms ending in -ization, such
as labialization, passivization. In psycholinguistics, considerable discus-
sion has taken place concerning the extent to which the linguistic processes
encountered in a linguistic model can be related to processes of a psychological
kind (see performance grammar, correspondence hypothesis).
(2)
One of the two main categories of Aktionsarten (see aspect) in the classi-
ﬁcation of US philosopher Zeno Vendler (1900–2004). Process predicates are
divided into accomplishment, achievement and activity types, and con-
trasted with state predicates.
processing (n.)
An application in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics
of a term used in psychology for the cognitive operations which take place
during language production and comprehension. Any level of language can
be considered in processing terms (‘lexical processing’, ‘phonological processing’,
etc.), and processing models aim to represent the input/output relationship
between these levels, both for speaking/listening and reading/writing. The language
as a whole can be characterized in this way (language processing) as can the
content conveyed by language (information processing). An analogous use of the
term is found in computational linguistics, where it refers to the automated
388
process

handling of linguistic information. There are different views of the relationship
of processing to production: some see processing as separate from production;
some see production as a part of processing.
proclisis, proclitic (n.)
see clitic
pro-constituent (n.)
A term used in later generative linguistics, usually abbre-
viated to pro, and analogous to pro-form in other approaches, referring to an
element which substitutes for a lexical item elsewhere in a sentence. The
application of the term varies, depending on the grammatical model involved.
In government-binding theory, for example, the symbol PRO is associated
with a base-generated subject of certain inﬁnitives.
procrastination (n.)
In the minimalist programme, a general economy
constraint which states that all movements in a derivation should be delayed
as long as possible. An operation should take place only when it is needed,
and not before. The procrastinate principle prefers derivations which postpone
movements until after spell-out, so that the results of the movements do not
affect phonetic form.
pro-drop (adj.)
A term used in government-binding theory for a para-
meter which determines whether the subject of a clause can be suppressed.
Italian is a pro-drop language, in this sense, because it can have subjectless
sentences (e.g. E pericoloso ‘It is dangerous’); by contrast, English is a non-
pro-drop language, as the translation of the Italian sentence indicates. Other
properties of pro-drop languages have been suggested, such as that they have
a rich system of verb-agreement, and free inversion of subject and verb.
Pro-drop languages are also known as ‘null subject’ languages. Languages that
can drop not only subjects but also objects and other phrases are called radical
pro-drop (e.g. Japanese).
product (n.)
see lattice
production (n.)
The general sense of this term is found in phonetics and
psycholinguistics, where it refers to the process of planning and executing
the act of speech. The study of speech production includes not only the
neuroanatomical and neurophysiological activities involved in speaking, but also
the construction and testing of models of the neural control system in the
brain’s organization of speech. A particular strategy is to analyse certain charac-
teristics of speech output (e.g. pause, tongue-slips, dynamic features), as a
means of inferring the properties of this system. Production is usually contrasted
with speech perception and comprehension.
productivity (n.)
A general term used in linguistics to refer to the creative
capacity of language users to produce and understand an indeﬁnitely large
number of sentences. It contrasts particularly with the unproductive commun-
ication systems of animals, and in this context is seen by some linguists as one
of the design features of human language. The term is also used in a more
restricted sense with reference to the use made by a language of a speciﬁc feature
productivity
389

or pattern. A pattern is productive if it is repeatedly used in language to produce
further instances of the same type (e.g. the past-tense afﬁx -ed in English is
productive, in that any new verb will be automatically assigned this past-tense
form). Non-productive (or unproductive) patterns lack any such potential; e.g.
the change from mouse to mice is not a productive plural formation – new
nouns would not adopt it, but would use instead the productive s-ending
pattern. Semi-productive forms are those where there is a limited or occasional
creativity, as when a preﬁx such as un- is sometimes, but not universally,
applied to words to form their opposites, e.g. happy ⇒ unhappy, but not sad ⇒
*unsad.
pro-form (n.)
A term used in some models of grammatical description to
refer collectively to the items in a sentence which substitute for other items or
constructions. The central class of examples (from which the term is derived
by analogy) is pronouns, which substitute for noun phrases. Other pro-forms
replace adjective phrases (e.g. so in John is very tall and so is Mary), preposi-
tional phrases (e.g. then, there), verb phrases (e.g. do in I like ﬁlms and John
does too), and even whole clauses or sentences (e.g. so as in I said so). Termino-
logy such as pro-verb, pro-nominal, pro-locative, pro-NP, etc., is therefore likely
to be encountered.
progressive (adj./n.) (prog) (1)
A term used in the grammatical description of
verb forms, referring to a contrast of a temporal or durative kind, and thus
handled sometimes under the heading of tense and sometimes under aspect.
The usual contrast recognized is between ‘progressive’ or ‘continuous’ (e.g. I am
going) and non-progressive or ‘simple’ (e.g. I go). linguists prefer an aspectual
analysis here, because of the complex interaction of durational, completive and
temporal features of meaning involved; traditional grammars, however, merely
refer to ‘simple tense forms’, etc., and thus imply a meaning which is to some
degree an oversimpliﬁcation.
(2)
A term used in phonetics and phonology as part of the classiﬁcation
of types of assimilation. In progressive assimilation one sound inﬂuences
the following sound, as when [s] becomes [à] following [dè], in such phrases as
Goodge Street. It is opposed to regressive and coalescent assimilations.
projection (n.)
A term used in generative linguistics to characterize the
capability of a grammar to extend the analysis of any given set of sentences
so that it applies also to the potentially inﬁnite number of sentences in the
language as a whole. The main means of doing this is the generative rule. In
some models of generative grammar, a more restricted sense is found: pro-
jection rules are established as part of the semantic component, their function
being to assign a semantic interpretation to each string of formatives
generated by the syntactic component.
A central principle of government-binding theory is the projection principle,
which projects the properties of lexical entries on to the structure of the
sentence. It states that the sub-categorization requirements of lexical items
must be satisﬁed at all levels of representation. It eliminates the need for rules
combining lexical items with their complements, and requires a trace to be
left when a complement is removed. The extended projection principle requires
390
pro-form

that all sentences must have a subject. In X-bar syntax, phrasal projections
(or bar projections) refer to the different types of phrasal expansion of any
word-level category: a single-bar projection into a ‘small’ X-bar phrase, and
a double-bar projection into a ‘large’ X-double-bar phrase. All full phrases
(e.g. AP, NP, PP) are maximal projections – levels above which the properties of
the lexical entries for the heads have no inﬂuence. In a later development, IP
and CP are viewed as extended projections of V, and DP and PP as extended
projections of N. In the grid and bracketed-grid theories of metrical phono-
logy, ‘projection’ refers to the introduction of a new line in the grid. See also
intermediate (2).
prominent (adj.)
A term used in auditory phonetics to refer to the degree to
which a sound or syllable stands out from others in its environment. Vari-
ations in length, pitch, stress and inherent sonority are all factors which
contribute to the relative prominence of a unit. An abstract sense of the term is
often used in phonology; for example, in metrical phonology, it refers to
the relative weight between constituents in a metrical tree, deﬁned in terms
of the values of s (‘stronger than’) and w (‘weaker than’).
promotion (n.) (1)
A term used in relational grammar for a class of rela-
tion-changing processes which make a noun phrase more prominent. In the
process of advancement, an NP which bears a particular grammatical relation to
some verb comes to bear another grammatical relation to that verb, which is
higher up the relational hierarchy. In the process of ascension, an NP which
is part of a larger NP comes to bear the grammatical relation previously borne
by the larger NP.
(2)
Promotion is also found in some models of feature geometry, to refer to
an alteration in the status of a construct (e.g. a feature, an articulation) from
a lower to a higher level. For example, a minor articulation (such as palatal-
ization) may be assigned major status under certain conditions.
pronominalization (n.)
A term used in classical transformational grammar
to refer to a rule which replaces a lexical noun phrase with a pronoun. In
later approaches within generative grammar, pronouns are base-generated. In
government-binding theory, the term pronominal is used for a type of noun
phrase (along with anaphors and R-expressions) of particular importance
as part of a theory of binding. Pronominals include the class of personal
pronouns, and little and big pro. A pronominal NP must be free in its govern-
ing category.
pronoun (n.) (pro, PRO, pron)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation
of words, referring to the closed set of items which can be used to substitute
for a noun phrase (or single noun). There are many types of pronoun, with
terminology varying somewhat between grammars. Personal pronouns include I,
you, etc., in their variant forms (e.g. I/me); in their form my/mine, the term
possessive pronoun (pos(s), POS(S)) is often used. Other classes of pronoun
regularly recognized include: demonstrative pronouns, e.g. this/that (in certain
of their uses); interrogative pronouns, e.g. certain uses of who/which/what;
reﬂexive pronouns, e.g. myself/yourself; indeﬁnite pronouns, e.g. anyone/nobody;
pronoun
391

relative pronouns, e.g. who/whom/that; and resumptive or shadow pronouns,
e.g. him in John, I like him. A logophoric pronoun (or logophor) refers to a
person whose speech or thought is represented in discourse. The grammatical
statement of pronominal distribution in a language is usually quite complex. It
is often discussed with reference to the more general notions of pro-form
and deixis. See also lazy pronoun.
prop (adj.)
A term used in some grammatical descriptions to refer to a
meaningless element introduced into a structure to ensure its grammaticality,
e.g. the it in it’s a lovely day. Such words are also referred to as empty, because
they lack any semantically independent meaning. substitute words, which
refer back to a previously occurring element of structure, are also often called
prop words, e.g. one or do in he’s found one, he does, etc.
proper (adj.)
A term used primarily in the grammatical classiﬁcation of nouns,
opposed traditionally to a set of terms including common, abstract, etc., but
in linguistic analysis usually contrasting with ‘common’ alone. The alternative
term, proper name, reﬂects its traditional semantic deﬁnition: the name of
an individual person, place, etc. Modern grammars aim to provide a formal
treatment of these distinctions: proper nouns, for example, cannot be used with
determiners in the way common nouns can, cf. the/a boy with *the/a London,
etc. In government-binding theory, proper government is government by a
lexical category. See also government phonology.
proportional (adj.)
A type of opposition recognized in Prague School
phonology, distinguished from isolated. The opposition between /f/ and /v/
in English is proportional, because there are other oppositions in the language
which work in parallel, e.g. /s/ and /z/, /à/ and /è/; on the other hand, the
opposition between, say, /v/ and /l/ is isolated – there are no other segments that
are contrasted in this particular way, i.e. voiced labio-dental fricative
v. voiced lateral.
proposition (n.)
A term derived from philosophy, where its status is controver-
sial, and often used in linguistics as part of a grammatical or semantic
analysis. It is normally understood to refer to the sense of a declarative
sentence, with all ambiguity, vagueness and deixis resolved, so that a deﬁn-
ite truth value may be assigned. An atomic proposition is one which does
not have other propositions as parts; it is usually analysed as consisting of a
single predicate with an appropriate number of arguments. In possible-
worlds semantics, a proposition is regarded as a set of possible worlds (or
world–time pairs). The propositional calculus is a system for representing pro-
positions (or sentences, or statements) in formal notation, with a set of
semantic or deductive rules used for proving examples of logical conse-
quence, logical truth, etc. Propositional logic deals only with those aspects
of logic which do not require an analysis of the internal structure of atomic
propositions, and standardly includes an analysis of the truth functional
connectives. It is weaker than the more complex predicate calculus. In lin-
guistics, the interest is primarily in the way in which different linguistic forms
can be shown to express the same proposition (e.g. The cat ate the meat, The
392
prop

meat was eaten by the cat, and so on), and how a single linguistic form can be
analysed in terms of several propositions (e.g. Those nice red apples cost a lot
expresses the propositions that ‘the apples cost a lot’, ‘the apples are nice’ and
‘the apples are red’). The notion of ‘proposition’ is fundamental to case gram-
mar, where it is used as one of the two main underlying constituents of
sentences (Sentence ⇒ Modality+Proposition): each proposition is analysed in
terms of a predicate word and its associated arguments (i.e. case roles). Also of
interest is the distinction to be made between the propositional meaning of a
sentence on the one hand, and the use made of the sentence (e.g. in various
speech-act situations) on the other. Linguists are not primarily concerned with
the evaluation of a proposition in terms of truth-values, nor with the question
of the referential or cognitive status of the notion. See also analytic (2), idea-
tional, synthetic (2).
propositional attitude
A term used in philosophy, and often encountered in
semantic theory, for mental attitudes such as belief, hope, doubt, etc. Such
attitudes are commonly analysed as relations which an individual may stand in
to a proposition. The semantic analysis of verbs representing propositional
attitudes has played a central role in the discussion of intensionality (see inten-
sion (2)).
propositional calculus
see proposition
proscriptive (adj.)
A term used by linguists to characterize any approach
which attempts to lay down rules of correctness, emphasizing how lan-
guage should not be used. For example, the view that ‘sentences should not
end with prepositions’ is a ‘proscriptive rule’. These normative statements
are usually made within the overall context of a prescriptive grammar.
prosodeme (n.)
see prosody
prosodic bootstrapping
see bootstrapping
prosodic phonology
see prosody
prosody (n.)
A term used in suprasegmental phonetics and phonology to
refer collectively to variations in pitch, loudness, tempo and rhythm. Some-
times it is used loosely as a synonym for ‘suprasegmental’, but in a narrower
sense it refers only to the above variables, the remaining suprasegmental features
being labelled paralinguistic. The narrow sense is close to the traditional use
of the term ‘prosody’, where it referred to the characteristics and analyses of
verse structure. The term prosodic features is preferred in linguistics, partly
to enable a distinction to be drawn with the traditional use. In some approaches
to phonology, the term sentence prosody is used to group together intonation,
phrasal rhythmic patterning and more general features of prosodic phrasing.
The above use treats ‘prosody’ as a mass noun.
In the theory of phonology proposed by J. R. Firth (prosodic phonology),
prosody is treated as a count noun, and given special status (see Firthian). It is
distinguished in this approach from phonematic unit: the latter is a segmental
prosody
393

unit, such as consonant or vowel, whereas prosodies are features extending over
stretches of utterance (one talks of ‘sentence prosodies’, ‘syllable prosodies’,
etc.) – a notion which took on a more central role in later thinking (see below,
and also the concept of ‘semantic prosody’ in lexicology: see semantics). Not
only would pitch, stress and juncture patterns be subsumed under the heading
of prosody, but such features as secondary articulations would also be
included, e.g. lip-rounding or nasalization, when these are used to account
for phonotactic restrictions, or to characterize grammatical structure (as in
the notion of ‘vowel harmony’). Another feature of Firth’s prosodic analysis
is its polysystemic principle: it permits different phonological systems to be
set up at different places in grammatical, lexical or phonological structure: e.g.
the contrasts which occur at the beginning of a word may not be the same as
those which occur at the end, and this fact is given special attention in this
approach.
In phonemic phonology, linguistically contrastive prosodic features are often
referred to as prosodemes. In generative phonology, prosodic features are
considered to be one of the ﬁve main dimensions of classiﬁcation of speech
sounds (the others being major class features, cavity features, manner-
of-articulation features and source features). Recently, the term has been
applied to a model of morphology in which non-linear phonological rep-
resentations play a central role. Using notation derived from autosegmental
phonology, the approach is based on the view that information about the
canonical pattern of segments in a form (the prosodic template) is repres-
ented on a different tier from information about the kinds of segments occurring
in the form. In metrical phonology, one of the levels of structure in a
metrical tree is referred to as a prosodic level.
In prosodic morphology, the focus is speciﬁcally on the way in which morpho-
logical and phonological determinants of linguistic form interact, and the notion
of prosody becomes more powerful, as it is seen to determine the structure
of morphological templates. This approach makes reference to the prosodic
morphology hypothesis (templates are deﬁned in terms of the units in a prosodic
hierarchy – mora, syllable, foot and prosodic word) and the notion of
prosodic circumscription (the domain to which morphological operations apply
is circumscribed by prosodic as well as morphological criteria). In an alternative
account, p-structure (i.e. ‘prosodic structure’) is seen as a level at which syntactic
and phonological components interact, with its own hierarchical organization
of four domains – phonological word, phonological phrase, intonational phrase
and utterance – the properties of which are speciﬁed by prosodic hierarchy
theory (‘hierarchy’ here referring to a higher level of structural organization
than in the case of prosodic morphology). Some model of a prosodic hierarchy
is assumed in most modern phonological frameworks.
protasis (n.) /cpr∞tvs}s/
see apodosis
prothesis (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to a type
of intrusion, where an extra sound has been inserted initially in a word:
a type of epenthesis. Prothetic sounds are common both in historical change
(e.g. Latin spiritus ⇒ French esprit) and in connected speech (e.g. left turn
pronounced as /vleft tvpn/).
394
protasis

proto-
A preﬁx used in historical linguistics to refer to a linguistic form
or state of a language said to be the ancestor of attested forms/languages,
e.g. Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Romance. More recently, some linguists have
begun to use the term analogously in the context of language acquisition, to
refer to the emerging linguistic system of the young child, in such uses as ‘proto-
conversation’, ‘proto-sentence’ (see phonetically consistent form).
proto-role
see semantic role
prototype (n.)
A term used in semantics and psycholinguistics for a typ-
ical member of the extension of a referring expression (see referent). For
example, a sparrow would be a prototype of bird, whereas an ostrich (because
of its atypical characteristics, notably its inability to ﬂy) would not. The notion
has been particularly fruitful in studies of child language acquisition, where it
has been used to help explain the order of emergence of complex sets of related
lexical items, such as types of chair, drinking utensil or vehicle. Prototype
semantics involves the development of criteria for the deﬁnition of prototypical
meaning, with particular reference to the way that the ‘radial set’ of overlapping
meanings interrelate, and the nature of category membership and boundaries.
See also basic level.
proto-word (n.)
see phonetically consistent form
proxemics (n.)
A term used in semiotics to refer to the study of variations in
posture, interpersonal distance and tactile contact in human communication.
These variations in interpersonal space are often culture-speciﬁc, and can be
analysed in terms of sex, age, intimacy, social role and other such factors.
pseudo-cleft sentence
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a
construction which resembles a cleft sentence, in that a single clause has
been divided into two separate sections, each with its own verb, but with the
essential difference that the subject is a free-standing wh-clause. For example,
the sentence You are a fool is related to What you are is a fool or (an ‘inverted’
or ‘reversed’ pseudo-cleft) A fool is what you are.
pseudo-intransitive (adj./n.)
see transitivity
pseudo-passive (adj./n.)
see passive
pseudo-procedure (n.)
A term sometimes used in linguistics and phonetics to
refer to an analytic procedure which claims to work in a certain way, but which
is in fact incapable of doing so, e.g. to assume that phonological distinctions
can be established by scrutinizing the acoustic patterns displayed on a spectro-
gram, or that it is possible to do grammatical analysis without reference to
meaning.
psych (adj.)
A term sometimes used in grammar and semantics to describe
verbs which express a psychological state, and their associated phrasal con-
structions and predicates. Psych verbs (or experiencer verbs) include amaze,
psych
395

interest, frighten, love and upset, and associated forms are illustrated by such
passive constructions as be amazed at and be interested in. A distinction is often
drawn between experiencer–subject constructions, such as The cat is scared of
the noise, and experiencer–object constructions, such as The noise frightened
the cat. Psych-movement is an operation which moves the object of a psych verb
into the subject position, leaving the former subject as a prepositional phrase:
Mike upsets me becomes I am upset with Mike.
psycholexicology (n.)
see lexicology
psycholinguistics (n.)
A branch of linguistics which studies the correlation
between linguistic behaviour and the psychological processes thought to underlie
that behaviour. There are two possible directions of study. One may use language
as a means of elucidating psychological theories and processes (e.g. the role of
language as it affects memory, perception, attention, learning, etc.), and for this
the term psychological linguistics is sometimes used. Alternatively, one may
investigate the effects of psychological constraints on the use of language (e.g.
how memory limitations affect speech production and comprehension).
It is the latter which has provided the main focus of interest in linguistics, where
the subject is basically seen as the study of the mental processes underlying
the planning, production, perception and comprehension of speech, and invest-
igations typically proceed by examining linguistic performance through small-
scale experimental tasks. A theory-driven approach is also encountered, in which
evidence to support a point of linguistic theory (often in relation to generative
grammar) accumulates using such techniques as adult grammaticality judge-
ments. The subject now includes a large number of research domains, notably
child language acquisition, second language acquisition, language processing,
linguistic complexity, the relationship between linguistic and cognitive univer-
sals, the study of reading, language pathology, and species speciﬁcity. See also
developmental linguistics.
psychological reality
see realistic grammar
pulmonic (adj.)
In phonetics the usual term to describe activity associated
with the lungs. The pulmonic airstream mechanism, for example, refers to
the use of the lungs to initiate an airﬂow for speech production. Most human
speech involves pulmonic sounds.
pulse theory
see syllable
punctual (adj.) (punct)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of aspect, to
refer to a momentary event, thought of as having no temporal duration; it thus con-
trasts with durative or continuous events, where a period of time is involved.
pure tone
see tone (2)
pure vowel
A term used in phonetics referring to a vowel sound with no per-
ceived change in quality during a syllable, as in pot or pit. Alternatively known
as a monophthong, its opposite is ‘gliding vowel’ (see glide (2)) or diphthong.
396
psycholexicology

purism (n.)
A term used pejoratively in linguistics to characterize a school
of thought which sees a language as needing preservation from the external
processes which might inﬁltrate it and thus make it change, e.g. the pressures
exercised by other dialects and languages (as in loan words) and the vari-
ations introduced by colloquial speech. This purist concern is considered mis-
placed by linguists, who point to the inevitability of language change, as a reﬂex
of social, cultural and psychological development.
push chain

Q
qualia structure /ckwe}l}v/, singular quale /ckwe}lip/
A theory of lexical seman-
tics that represents the semantic content of lexical items with a division into
different types (qualia). For example, for a noun the types are: formal (the
item’s place in a taxonomy), constitutive (the relation between an item and its
parts), telic (what uses it typically has), and agentive (how the item has come
into being and exists). The aim is to explain how different senses of a word can
be evoked in different contexts. Thus a hospital can be both an institution and
a building, or a door both an aperture and a physical object.
qualiﬁcation (n.)
A term used in syntax to refer to certain types of structural
dependence of one grammatical unit upon another. In some traditional
grammars, for example, dependent items in a noun phrase (such as adject-
ives, prepositional phrases) were said to qualify the noun (act as qualiﬁers).
In Hallidayan grammar, on the other hand, the term is reserved for structures
following the head of the noun phrase: the car in the street would be analysed
in terms of M–H–Q, standing for modiﬁcation–head–qualiﬁcation.
quality (n.) (1)
A term used in auditory phonetics and phonology to refer
to the characteristic resonance, or timbre, of a sound, which is the result of
the range of frequencies constituting the sound’s identity. Variations in both
vowels and consonants are describable in terms of quality, e.g. the distinction
between [i], [e], etc., would be called a qualitative difference. In this sense, the
term ‘quality’ is generally opposed to quantity or length. Voices are also
described as having a characteristic ‘quality’ (see voice quality).
(2)
A term identifying one of the maxims of conversation: the maxim of
quality states that a person’s contribution to a conversation should ideally be
true – for example, people should not say what they believe to be false.
quantal theory
see quantum
quantiﬁer (n.) (Q)
A term used in semantic or logical analysis, referring to a
set of items which express contrasts in quantity, such as all, some, each. The status
of some of these items has particular signiﬁcance in the construction of logical
systems, and the distinctions made in logic between universal quantiﬁcation

(i.e. ‘for all X, it is the case that . . .’) and existential quantiﬁcation (i.e. ‘for
some X, it is the case that . . .’) may be found in semantic studies. In some
models of grammatical description, quantiﬁers refer to a class of items
expressing contrasts in quantity occurring with restricted distribution in the
noun phrase, e.g. much/many, several, a lot of. Adverbs of quantiﬁcation
(e.g. usually, seldom) may also be recognized, especially in semantic studies. The
rule of quantiﬁer-ﬂoating has been proposed by some transformational
linguists, to handle the mobile properties of quantiﬁers in sentences, as in
All the people arrived v. The people all arrived. Quantiﬁer-raising is a process
assumed in government-binding theory which applies in the mapping from
S-structure to logical form and moves a quantiﬁed noun phrase such as
everyone into clause-initial position, giving structures similar to those assumed
in logic.
quantitative linguistics
A branch of linguistics which studies the frequency
and distribution of linguistic units using statistical techniques. The subject
has both a pure and an applied side: the former aims to establish general
principles concerning the statistical regularities governing the way words, sounds,
etc., are used; the latter investigates the way statistical techniques can be used to
elucidate linguistic problems (such as functional load, stylistic distinctive-
ness, authorship identity). Considerable use is made of corpora.
quantity (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology to refer to the relative durations
of sounds and syllables when these are linguistically contrastive; also referred
to as length. The term is particularly used in historical studies of vowel and
syllable length, and is contrasted with the notion of quality; but a quantitative
analysis also applies to consonants, as seen in such notions as ‘long’ v. ‘short’
consonants and gemination.
(2)
A term identifying one of the maxims of conversation: the maxim of
quantity states that a person’s contribution to a conversation should ideally be
just as informative as is required for the purposes of an exchange – for example,
avoiding verbosity.
quantity sensitivity
In metrical phonology, a foot-shape parameter gov-
erning the distribution of light and heavy syllables in terminal nodes of
feet. In quantity-insensitive feet, all syllables are treated as equally light or
equally heavy; there are no restrictions. In quantity-sensitive feet, heavy syllables
may not occur in recessive positions, and are stressed. Quantity-determined
feet are quantity-sensitive, with the additional requirement that dominant
terminal nodes must dominate heavy syllables. Quantity sensitivity may also be
formalized using moras (as in metrical grid theory).
quantum (n.)
In phonetics, a term sometimes used for an anatomical region
within which relatively large variations in articulation have no or minor
acoustic consequences. However, a small shift outside of this zone will
produce a large acoustic change. For example, when a constriction reaches a
critical cross-sectional area, there is a sudden shift as the sound moves from an
approximant to a fricative mode of articulation. It is argued that articulation
is evolutionarily organized to make maximum use of the vocal tract’s ability to
quantum
399

produce such changes, which are thus critical in the development of phono-
logical distinctiveness. The notion is central to the quantal theory of speech
proposed by US phonetician Kenneth N. Stevens (b. 1924). In a development of
this approach, quantal relationships are proposed both between articulation and
acoustics and also between acoustics and perception.
question (n.) (Q)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of sentence functions,
typically used to elicit information or a response, and deﬁned sometimes on
grammatical and sometimes on semantic or sociolinguistic grounds. syntac-
tically, in English, a question is a sentence with inversion of the subject
and ﬁrst verb in the verb phrase (yes–no questions, such as Is he going?),
commencing with a question word (WH-questions, such as Where is he?), or
ending with a question tag (e.g. He’s going, isn’t he?). Some would include the
use of sentences with a rising intonation to be a class of question. Semantic-
ally, questions express a desire for more information, usually requesting a reply
from the listener (exceptions include rhetorical questions (e.g. Isn’t that awful?)).
The term is usually contrasted with three other major sentence functions: state-
ment, command and exclamation. In grammatical discussion, questions are
usually referred to as interrogative in form. Sentences which contain a sub-
ordinate clause which is interrogative in form are sometimes called indirect
questions (or embedded questions), as in They asked what they should do. See
also direct (2).
Quirk grammar
The approach to grammatical description pioneered by British
linguist (Charles) Randolph Quirk (Lord Quirk, b. 1920) and his associates,
and published in a series of reference grammars during the 1970s and 1980s,
notably A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language (1985). It is a
synthesis of knowledge about the grammatical structure of English, bringing
together information from a range of descriptive approaches, informed by
copious illustration from corpus materials, and paying special attention to
stylistic and regional varieties. Terminology generally falls within the European
tradition of reference grammars (clause, subject, verb, object, etc.), but a
number of novel terms are introduced, such as comment clause, echo utter-
ances, and the distinction between conjunct, disjunct, and subjunct.
quotative (n.)
In discourse analysis, a term used for a form which introduces
a piece of direct speech (e.g. she said, he goes). A zero quotative is the report-
ing of direct speech with neither a reporting verb nor an attributed speaker.

raising (n.) (1)
A type of rule recognized in some models of transforma-
tional grammar: in its broadest sense, any rule that moves a constituent
to a higher position. In a ‘raising-to-object’ (or object-raising rule, the linear
constituents in a string consisting of a main clause + complement clause
(e.g. he believes John to be honest) are bracketed so that the subject of the
complement clause appears to have been raised to become the object of the
higher clause (he believes it + John is honest becoming he believes John + to be
honest). In a subject-raising rule, an underlying subject complement clause has
the subject taken from it and ‘raised’ to be the subject of the main clause. For
example, in relating such sentences as it seems that the man is angry to the man
seems angry, one may begin with:
Subject-raising (in association with other transformational operations, omitted
here) places the man as subject of seems, producing (the man) (seems) (to be
angry). The formalization of such rules is controversial, as is the extent of
their application (they are both governed rules, applying to small classes of
verb only). In government-binding theory, classical TG subject-to-object
raising constructions are analysed in terms of exceptional case marking, and

classical TG subject-raising constructions in terms of NP-movement. In phrase-
structure grammar and lexical functional grammar, both are regarded
as types of control constructions. Sometimes raising constructions are referred
to as catenative constructions. Other syntactic applications of the term
‘raising’ may also be encountered (e.g. ‘predicate-raising’, ‘negative raising’,
‘quantiﬁer raising’).
(2)
In phonetics and phonology, a vertical process affecting tongue height;
opposed to lowering. For example, in the study of vowel harmony, a vowel
might be said to raise (e.g. from mid to high) in the context of a following high
vowel. In the course of language change, a vowel in an originally low position
might be raised to a relatively high position.
rank (n.)
In Hallidayan linguistics, a term which refers to one of the
scales of analysis, which interrelates the categories of the theory, viz.
the hierarchical arrangement of linguistic units within a linguistic level.
The grammatical rank scale, for instance, recognizes sentence–clause–group–
word–morpheme in a relationship of inclusion (i.e. a sentence consists of one
or more clauses, etc.). Other scales in this approach are labelled exponence and
delicacy. The term rank shift is used to refer to a linguistic process when a
given unit is ‘shifted’ down the rank scale, so that it operates within the
structure of a lower unit (or one of equal rank); e.g. a clause working within a
group (as in relative clauses, e.g. the lady who came in asked . . . ) is said to be
a rank-shifted clause.
rate (n.)
 An application of the general sense of this term in phonetics and
phonology to refer to speed of speaking; alternatively known as tempo. lan-
guages and people vary in their overall rate of articulation (measured in
such terms as syllables per second, words per minute, incidence of pauses).
Within a given norm, however, it is possible to vary one’s rate for particular
semantic or social effects, e.g. the ‘meditative’ sense of we-e-ll, produced very
slowly. Rate thus forms part of the contrastivity studied by suprasegmental
phonology.

r-colouring (n.)

readjustment rules
A class of rules in generative grammar which help to
relate the syntactic component to the phonological component. The rules
make modiﬁcations in surface structures by effecting individual changes in
the shapes of certain formatives in the context of other formatives. The output
of these rules then provides the input to the phonological rules. For example,
readjustment rules would take the formative ‘past’ (i.e. past tense) and gener-
ally replace it by d; however, in such cases as sing, the rules would provide a
special feature speciﬁcation to ensure that i would be converted to a.
realis /r}cwpl}s/ (adj.)
In semantics, a term used in the study of epistemic
modality: in a realis (‘real’) assertion, a proposition is strongly asserted to
be true, the speaker being ready to back up the assertion with evidence or
402
rank

argument. It is opposed to an irrealis (irr) (‘unreal’) assertion, where the propo-
sition is weakly asserted to be true, but the speaker is not ready to support the
assertion. Realis verb forms include the past tense (‘X did Y’); irrealis forms
include certain modals (‘X may do Y’). Realis adverbs include fortunately and
sadly; irrealis adverbs include maybe and hopefully.
realistic grammar
A term sometimes used in linguistic theory to refer to any
approach to grammatical analysis which aims to be psychologically real, in that
it contributes to the explanation of such areas of linguistic behaviour as compre-
hension and memory. A contrast is intended between this approach and earlier,
formal characterizations of grammar on the basis of intuition alone. In its
earliest exposition, the intention was to realize a transformational grammar
within a psychological model of language use, so that the model genuinely
represents users’ knowledge of their language. Such a grammar would also be
‘realizable’, i.e. deﬁne explicit realizations which would map grammatical
rules and categories on to processing operations and informational units,
as deﬁned by the psychological model. In this way, it was hoped that realistic
grammars, through the use of psycholinguistic as well as linguistic criteria,
would provide further insight into the nature of competence, as well as help to
evaluate the merits of competing formal grammars (see adequacy). Psycho-
logical reality remains an important issue in linguistic research.
realization (n.) (1)
The physical expression of an abstract linguistic unit;
e.g. phonemes are realized in phonic substance as phones, morphemes as
morphs. Any underlying form may be seen as having a corresponding real-
ization in substance. Alternative terms are actualization, manifestation,
exponence and representation, though the latter two are not restricted to
expression solely at a physical level.
(2)
Realization grammar is a label sometimes used for a grammar which derives
all sentences from their corresponding semantic representation.
(3)
In stratiﬁcational grammar, realizational analysis is one of two main
types of linguistic patterning (the other being tactic analysis), which involves
the setting-up of four basic types of operation: ‘horizontal grouping’ (e.g. d+o+g
⇒ dog), ‘horizontal splitting’ (e.g. French des realizes de + les), ‘vertical grouping’
(two or more lower-level units realize one higher-level unit, e.g. the various
forms of the plural morpheme), and ‘vertical splitting’ (two or more higher-
level units are realized by one lower-level unit, e.g. -s realizing both plural
and possessive).
reanalysis (n.) (1)
In the study of language change, a development which alters the
structure or function of a linguistic form. For example, when two words coa-
lesce as a compound, their separate identities need to be reanalysed as a whole
(hair noun + cut verb ⇒ haircut noun). Any level of language could be affected: for
example, a lexical item (such as a main verb) might develop into a grammatical
item (such as an auxiliary verb), a phonological change might require a
reanalysis of the syllable divisions in a word, or a segment of one word might
be assigned to another (English a naddre ⇒ an adder). See also analogy.
(2)
Reanalysis is used in generative (especially transformational) gram-
mar for a process which enables a sequence of syntactic categories to be
reanalysis
403

taken together as a single unit; sometimes known as restructuring. For example,
the sentence [NP the lady] [V took] [NP account] [PP of [NP his answer]] might be
reanalysed as [NP the lady] [V took account of] [NP his answer]. The factors which
govern the application of such rules are little understood.
reassociation (n.)
see association line
recategorization (n.)
see category
received pronunciation (RP)
The name given to the regionally neutral accent
in British English, historically deriving from the prestige speech of the Court and
the public schools. The term indicates that its prestige is the result of social
factors, not linguistic ones. RP is in no sense linguistically superior or inferior to
other accents: but it is the accent (more accurately: a set of accents) which tends
to be associated with the better-educated parts of society, and is the one most
often cited as a norm for the description of British English, or in teaching that
dialect to foreigners. The BBC originally adopted RP for its announcers because
it was the form of pronunciation most likely to be nationally understood, and
to attract least regional criticism – hence the association of RP with the phrase
‘BBC English’. These days, the BBC, as indeed educated speech at large, displays
considerable regional variation, and many modiﬁed forms of RP exist (modiﬁed
RP). RP no longer has the prestigious social position it once held. In the eyes of
many (especially of the younger generations), regionally marked forms of accent
are more desirable. The present-day situation is plainly one of rapid change. See
Estuary English.
recessive (adj.)
In metrical phonology, a term used to refer to the non-
dominant elements in a foot. In left-dominant feet, all right nodes are recess-
ive, and in right-dominant feet all left nodes are recessive. Recessive nodes do
not branch.
recipient (n.)
A term used by some linguists as part of the grammatical or
semantic analysis of a sentence in terms of cases or participant roles: it
usually refers to the animate being passively implicated by the happening or
state expressed by the verb (e.g. I gave you the cheque). It is typically the role
of the indirect object, but other elements may act as recipient – such as the
subject in such sentences as John has seen a vision. Alternative terms include
patient, dative and affected, but different approaches vary in their use of
these terms.
recipient language
A term used chieﬂy in historical linguistics to refer to a
language which takes in items (words, sounds, etc.) from another language (the
donor or source language). The term is often used in the study of the way loan
words are adapted to suit the new phonological system.
reciprocal (adj.) (1)
A term used in phonetics and phonology as part of the
classiﬁcation of types of assimilation. In reciprocal (or ‘coalescent’) assimila-
tion, each of two adjacent articulations inﬂuences the other. An example is
the fusion of [d] and [j] to produce [u] in such phrases as could you.
404
reassociation

(2) (recip)
In some models of grammatical description, the term is used to
refer to classes which express the meaning of mutual relationship, e.g. reciprocal
pronouns such as each other, or reciprocal verbs such as meet. In government-
binding theory, reciprocal pronouns, along with reﬂexive pronouns and
NP-traces, form the class of anaphors.
recognition (n.)
see speaker recognition, speech recognition
reconstruction (n.) (1)
A method used in historical linguistics and com-
parative philology in which a hypothetical system of sounds or forms
representing an earlier, non-extant state of a language (‘proto-forms’ in a
‘proto-language’) is established deductively (reconstructed) from an analysis of
the attested sounds and forms of extant texts. This process of comparative
reconstruction is dependent on the existence of good written records or several
known related languages where systematic sound correspondences can be set up.
When these do not exist, as in many African and American Indian languages, it
is still possible to hypothesize about the historical development of the languages
by analysing the structural regularities and irregularities of their contem-
porary states, and deducing underlying forms which might reﬂect earlier states
– a process of internal reconstruction.
(2)
In government-binding theory, reconstruction is a process that occurs
in the mapping from S-structure to logical form, moving certain constitu-
ents back to their D-structure positions. It allows examples like which picture
of herself did Mary buy? to be analysed as ordinary cases of anaphora, in
which the anaphor is c-commanded by its antecedent.
recoverability (n.)
A term used in syntactic theory to refer to sentences where
elements which have been elided (or deleted) are capable of being retrieved
(are recoverable), by taking the linguistic context into account. In later gener-
ative grammar, it refers to a condition governing the application of deletion
rules, which speciﬁes that only elements which do not have semantic content
can be deleted.
recreolization (n.)
see creole
recursive (adj.)
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to rules which
are capable of application to their own output in generating a sentence, to the
structures thus generated, and to the languages characterized by such rules.
There is no limit, for example, to the number of adjectives which may be used
before a noun in English, or the number of adverbs which may modify a
verb. Such sequences would be introduced by the repeated (‘recursive’) applica-
tion of the appropriate adjective- or adverb-insertion rules in the relevant
section of the grammar. The importance of recursion (or recursiveness) is that
recursive rules are the main formal means of accounting for the creativity of
language: by using this device, an inﬁnite set of sentences can be generated
from a ﬁnite set of rules. A simple illustration of how this can be formalized is
in the following rules:
NP ⇒ Det + N (+ Prep Phrase)
Prep Phrase ⇒ Prep + NP
recursive
405

These rules say, in effect, that there is in principle no limit to the number of
prepositional phrases which may occur following a noun in a noun phrase,
e.g. the man in a coat with a collar . . . The phenomenon is also known as
‘iteration’. The term has also been used to deﬁne an extension of transition
network grammars – recursive transition networks (RTNs). In highly formal
discussion, the term may be used in its general mathematical sense to indicate a
function which can be modelled as an algorithm. A recursive language is
one whose characteristic function is recursive in this sense; the language and its
complement must both be recursively enumerable.
recursively enumerable
A term used in linguistic theory to designate languages
which can be generated by a Type-0 grammar on the Chomsky hierarchy,
or, equivalently, recognized by a Turing machine (see automaton). It is the
most general class of formal languages.
reduce (v.) (1)
A term used in the phonological classiﬁcation of vowel
sounds, referring to a vowel which can be analysed as a centralized variant
of a vowel in a related form. For example, the pronunciation of /∞v/ reduces to
/vv/ when unstressed; the stressed vowels in ctelegraph show reduction in the
related word teclegraphy /ctelvìrwpf/ ⇒ /tvcleìrvf}/.
(2)
A further phonological use of the term is found in the context of phono-
logical rules, where it refers to a process of simpliﬁcation which affects
certain types of sound sequence. The most important category is consonant-
cluster reduction (e.g. clock becoming /ì∞k/), which is common in early child
language.
(3)
In grammar, the term usually refers to a clause (a reduced clause)
which lacks one or more of the elements required to enable it to be used as a
full, independent construction, e.g. to see the book. Such clauses may be
referred to as ‘abbreviated’, elliptical or contracted; but different approaches
often introduce distinctions between these terms. Other units are sometimes
referred to as ‘reduced’, such as phrases (e.g. phone’s ringing) and words (e.g.
it’s him).
reduction (n.)
see reduce
redundancy (n.)
A term derived from information theory and applied to the
analysis of the range of features used in making linguistic contrasts. A fea-
ture (of sound, grammar, etc.) is redundant if its presence is unnecessary in
order to identify a linguistic unit. For example, the contrast between the /p/ and
/b/ phonemes of English, as in pin v. bin, may be deﬁned in terms of voicing,
muscular tension and aspiration; but only one of these features is necessary
to specify the contrast involved, and, once this decision has been made (e.g.
voicing), the other features would be seen as redundant, in respect of this
contrast. Features of sound (grammar, meaning) which are not considered
redundant are distinctive. It should be noted that circumstances may arise
which will affect the generality of an analysis; for instance, in other positions
in the word, other features may become less redundant (e.g. muscular tension in
ﬁnal position, as in such contrasts as rip v. rib), and in some varieties of speech
406
recursively enumerable

(such as public speaking, or in very noisy situations) the speaker may need to
use all the available features in order to be acceptable or intelligible.
Similar principles apply to the analysis of grammar and semantics in terms of
redundancy. In grammar, for example, sentences such as The bird ﬂies display
redundancy, in that both the subject and the verb are marked for singularity:
in theory, it would be possible for English to use, for example, the bird ﬂy v. the
birds ﬂy to keep a singular/plural distinction clear. In semantics, the issue is
more complex: what to one person might appear a totally unnecessary (and
hence redundant) use of a word or phrase may to someone else provide an
additional nuance, and thus be distinctive.
In generative linguistics, the notion of redundancy has been formalized in
terms of rules (redundancy rules) which simplify the form of descriptions. Any
feature which can be predicted on the basis of other features is said to be
redundant. For example, in generative phonology, when certain features of a
segment are predictable (because of the occurrence of other features in some
co-occurring segment), the speciﬁcation of these features is unnecessary:
such redundant feature speciﬁcations would be left blank in the underlying
representation of morphemes (the rules subsequently involved in inserting the
redundant features being referred to as ‘lexical-redundancy rules’ or morpheme-
structure rules). Redundancy rules are also important in underspeciﬁcation
theories of phonology. In generative syntax, the lexical-redundancy rules
apply to such processes as sub-categorization (thus simplifying the feature
speciﬁcation of a syntactic category) and word-formation (enabling one
word-class to be derived from another).
Various mathematical methods are available to demonstrate the nature and
extent of redundancy in linguistic analysis.
reduplication (n.) (red, redup)
A term in morphology for a process of repeti-
tion whereby the form of a preﬁx/sufﬁx reﬂects certain phonological char-
acteristics of the root. This process may be found in Greek, where the initial
consonant of the root is reduplicated in certain grammatical contexts
(perfective forms); e.g. /clupop/ λ2ω), ‘I loose’, becomes /cleluka/ (λ'λäκα), ‘I
have loosed’. In English the nearest one gets to this is in reduplicative compound
words, such as helter-skelter, shilly-shally. The phonological processes involved
in reduplication have been a particular focus of prosodic morphology, which
distinguishes the base form (B) of the reduplication from the repeating element
(the reduplicant, R), as well as preﬁxing and sufﬁxing types.
reference (n.) (1)
In grammatical analysis, a term often used to state a rela-
tionship of identity which exists between grammatical units, e.g. a pronoun
refers to a noun or noun phrase. When the reference is to an earlier part of the
discourse, it may be called back-reference (or anaphora); correspondingly,
reference to a later part of the discourse may be called forward-reference (or
cataphora). In switch reference languages, the verb indicates whether the
subjects of successive clauses are the same or different.

referent (n.)
A term used in philosophical linguistics and semantics for the
entity (object, state of affairs, etc.) in the external world to which a linguistic
expression relates: for example, the referent of the name Bill Clinton is Bill
Clinton himself. The term is found both as part of a two-term analysis of
meaning (e.g. words ~ things) and in three-term analyses (e.g. words ~ concepts
~ things). In linguistics, care is usually taken to distinguish knowledge of the
world from knowledge of language: the extralinguistic notion of reference is
contrasted with the intralinguistic notion of sense, a property arising from
the meaning relations between lexical items and sentences. Some theories
draw a distinction between speaker’s reference, or the act of referring to a par-
ticular object, as performed by a speaker in making an utterance, and semantic
reference, which is equivalent to denotation or extension. A referential
expression is an expression which refers to a particular object, as opposed to a
predicate, quantiﬁer, etc. The related notion of an R-expression in
government-binding theory applies to noun phrases which must be free.
Arbitrary reference is a term used in that theory for the reference of the under-
stood subject represented by pro.
referential (adj.)
see ideational, reference, referent
referential indices
A term used in generative grammar (since the Aspects
model) to refer to markers attached to a set of items in a sentence to show
identity or difference of reference. For example, both the sentences (a) The dog
saw the dog and (b) The dog saw itself could, on one analysis, be derived from
the same underlying structure The dog saw the dog. To mark the difference,
sentence (a) would be marked as The dogi saw the dogj, whereas (b) would be
The dogi saw the dogi. Items marked with the same referential-index variable
are co-referential; with different indices they are non-co-referential. In later
work, the term co-indexing is used.
referential opacity

referring-expression (n.)

reﬂectiveness (n.)
see reﬂexiveness
reﬂexive (adj./n.) (reﬂ, REFL, reﬂex)
A term used in grammatical description
to refer to a verb or construction where the subject and the object relate to
the same entity. English uses reﬂexive pronouns to express this relationship
(e.g. he kicked himself ), but the same verbal meaning is often present without
the pronoun (e.g. I shaved (myself)). Other languages use a variety of forms
for the expression of reﬂexive meaning, such as sufﬁxes, case endings and
word order. In transformational grammar, reﬂexivization refers to a rule
which introduces the reﬂexive pronouns into a sentence – in one formulation by
changing the syntactic feature on the object personal pronoun from [−reﬂexive]
to [+reﬂexive], when it is co-referential with the subject, e.g. she saw her ⇒
she saw herself. In government-binding theory, reﬂexives, together with
reciprocals, NP-traces and PRO, are base-generated anaphors – a class of
NPs. Other classes are pronouns and R-expressions.

reﬂexiveness (n.)
A suggested deﬁning property of human language (con-
trasting with the properties of other semiotic systems) whereby language can
be used to ‘talk about’ language; also called reﬂectiveness or reﬂexivity. The
development of this metalanguage leads to the terminology and notation
which this dictionary is attempting to elucidate. If a linguistic form is used as
a citation form it is said to be used reﬂexively, as in The cat is a noun
phrase.

register (n.) (1)
A term used in phonetics to refer to the voice quality
produced by a speciﬁc physiological constitution of the larynx. Variations in
the length, thickness and tension of the vocal folds combine to produce (in
singing) the differences between soprano, contralto, tenor, bass, etc. voices, and
also (within one person) such differences as between ‘head’ (‘falsetto’) and ‘chest’
(or ‘modal’) voice. Some phoneticians use the term in a functional way in
relation to speech, to refer to types of phonation which the speaker varies in a
controlled manner (as in creaky and breathy voice). See also downstep.
(2)
In stylistics and sociolinguistics, the term refers to a variety of lan-
guage deﬁned according to its use in social situations, e.g. a register of scientiﬁc,
religious, formal English. In Hallidayan linguistics, the term is seen as spe-
ciﬁcally opposed to varieties of language deﬁned according to the characteristics
of the users (viz. their regional or class dialect), and is given a subclassiﬁcation
into ﬁeld, mode and manner of discourse.
register tone language
A term introduced by Kenneth Pike (1912–2000) as
part of a classiﬁcation of tone languages. In a register tone system (e.g. Yoruba),
the critical feature is the relative height of the syllabic pitches, and not the
direction in which they move. level pitches are central, and if the language
makes use of changing pitches, the end-points of the falls or rises are iden-
tiﬁed with one of the level pitches. The notion contrasts with a ‘contour
tone language’ (e.g. Mandarin Chinese), where the critical feature is the nature
of the gliding tone rather than its relative pitch height. Mixed register/contour
tone systems (e.g. Trique) can also be found.
regressive (adj.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology as part of the
classiﬁcation of types of assimilation. In regressive (or ‘anticipatory’) assimila-
tion, a sound changes because of the following sound, as when [t] becomes [p]
in hot pies. It is opposed to progressive and coalescent assimilations.
regular (adj.)
A term referring to linguistic forms when they are in conform-
ity with the general rules of a language, i.e. they are predictable. In English,
for example, nouns such as boy, girl, dog are regular, in that they follow the
rules governing the majority of nouns (e.g. take plurals in -s); nouns such
as mouse and sheep are irregular, or ‘exceptions’. In traditional grammars,
regular
409

the notion was interpreted morphologically, e.g. ‘regular verbs’ were those
whose variant forms were in the majority, for a given class. In linguistics, the
notion includes both syntactic and morphological predictability. In historical
linguistics, regularity is a major explanatory principle, in that one attempts
to show systematic correspondences between languages and states of a lan-
guage, which can be formulated in general terms. comparative philologists
called such general correspondences sound laws, and much controversy took
place in the late nineteenth century, when it was argued (by the neogrammarians)
that sound laws admitted no exceptions which could not be explained by refer-
ence to other laws. The attempt to deal with exceptions by seeing them as
variants of a general rule (conditioned by regional, social or other factors) is a
major preoccupation of contemporary linguistics.
regular grammar
A term used in computational linguistics for a type of
grammar which describes only the linear (non-hierarchical) aspects of
a string of symbols. Such grammars allow only rules with a single non-
terminal symbol on the left-hand side, and at most one non-terminal symbol
(e.g. noun, verb) and one terminal on the right-hand side. See also ﬁnite-
state grammar.
Reichenbachian (adj.)
A term used in semantics to describe analyses deriving
from the treatment of tense presented by logician Hans Reichenbach (1891–
1953). In this approach, sentences are interpreted relative to three parameters
originally called point of speech, point of reference and point of the event – now
more frequently referred to as speech time, reference time and event time.
reiteration (n.)
A term used in Hallidayan analysis of the cohesive charac-
teristics of language to refer to the repeated use of a lexical item, or the use
of a synonymous lexical item, as a means of linking the various parts of a
text. An example is the use of car and monstrosity in the sequence John saw a
car. The car was very old. ‘What a monstrosity!’ he said. There are other means
of lexical linkage, e.g. collocation.
relation (n.)
A general term used in phonetics and linguistics to refer to
the linguistically signiﬁcant connections between two or more elements in
a language, such as equivalence, contrast, inclusion, government. In
grammatical analysis, for example, the functional role which a noun phrase
has in relation to a verb can be identiﬁed by using such terms as subject,
object, agent, complement, etc. These relational notions are central to some
theories (e.g. case grammar, relational grammar), and of marginal import-
ance in others (e.g. Aspects-model grammars). In semantics, the correspond-
ences between lexical items of similar, opposed etc., meanings are referred
to as sense relations, and classiﬁed under such headings as synonymy and
antonymy. At the most general level, linguistic relations can be classiﬁed into
syntagmatic and paradigmatic types. Several other applications will also be
encountered within particular theories (e.g. cognitive grammar).
relational expression

regular grammar

relational grammar (RG)
A development of generative linguistic thinking
of the mid-1970s which takes as central the notion of grammatical relations
(such as subject and object), rather than the categorial terms of standard
phrase-markers (e.g. NP, VP). transformations in this view are replaced
by operations performed on unordered relational networks – and formal
representations of sentences which show the grammatical relations that ele-
ments of a sentence bear to each other, and the syntactic level(s) at which these
relations hold. The approach is in marked contrast with most other versions
of generative grammar, where the emphasis is on syntactic categories such
as NP and VP, and on linear ordering, syntactic relations being speciﬁable
only derivatively.
relative (adj./n.) (1) (rel, REL)
A term used in grammatical description to
characterize pronouns which may be used to introduce a postmodifying
clause within a noun phrase, and by extension to the clause as a whole
(relative clauses). Relative pronouns in English include who, which, whom,
whose and that (see WH-), as used in such relative clauses as the man who went
was . . . When and where are sometimes called relative adverbs, when linking a
relative clause to a main clause (e.g. I remember the day (when) I ﬁrst saw John,
I remember the street where I lived as a child). Several detailed classiﬁcations
of relative pronouns and clauses have been made, distinguishing such types as:
adnominal (e.g. The answer which I received . . . ); nominal or free, which have
no head, and are therefore sometimes called headless (What interests me is his
motive . . . ); sentential (e.g. It’s said she’s back in the country – which I just
don’t believe); and zero or contact relatives (e.g. There’s the bus I caught).
Widely recognized in traditional as well as in linguistic grammars is the
contrast between restrictive (or deﬁning) and non-restrictive (or non-deﬁning)
types of relative: The Bible which I own was given to me by my grandmother v.
The Bible, which I often read, is my favourite book. In classical transforma-
tional grammar, the process of forming a relative-clause construction is
known as relativization. See also resumptive.
(2)
A term used in linguistic theory to refer to a type of universal. A relative
universal is one which characterizes a general tendency in a language, and
allows for exceptions; it contrasts with absolute universal.
(3)
A term used in historical linguistics, referring to one way of charac-
terizing the temporal relationship between language changes: to say that one
change occurs before another is a statement of relative chronology. A contrast
is intended with absolute chronology, where it is possible to state the speciﬁc
time-periods when the changes took place.

relativity (n.)
A term used to identify an inﬂuential view of the relationship
between language and thought, generally known as linguistic relativity, which
asserts, in its strongest form, that language determines the way people perceive
and organize their worlds. This view (of ‘linguistic determinism’) was ﬁrst
expounded by the German ethnologist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835): in
the twentieth century it came to be known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis.

relativized minimality

release (n./v.)
A term used in phonetics to refer to the type of movement made
by the vocal organs away from a point of articulation, particularly with refer-
ence to plosives. English plosives, for example, may be released with or without
aspiration, or as a lateral or nasal (as in button and bottle). In the distinc-
tive feature approach to phonology of Chomsky and Halle (see Chomskyan),
delayed and instantaneous (or abrupt) types of release are recognized.
relevance theory
A theory of communication and cognition which claims that
human cognition is geared to the maximizing of relevance (see maxims of
conversation). New information is relevant if it interacts with old information
to produce various contextual effects, and the more contextual effects it
produces the more relevant it is. On the other hand, the more processing effort
it involves the less relevant it is. The theory claims that all communicative acts
carry a guarantee of optimal relevance – a guarantee that they have enough
contextual effects and require no unnecessary processing effort – and that they
are interpreted in the light of this guarantee.
relexiﬁcation (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to a theory
concerning the origins of, and relationships between, pidgin (and creole) lan-
guages. The relexiﬁcation hypothesis proposes that the range of English, French,
Spanish, etc. pidgins is derived from the ﬁrst widely used pidgin language,
Portuguese pidgin, in the ﬁfteenth century in West Africa, by a process whereby
the grammar of this language was retained but new lexical items were
introduced from the other European languages. This view, it is maintained, pro-
vides a satisfactory explanation for the grammatical similarities noted between
pidgin languages, and for the many lexical similarities which seem to derive
from an original West African source or from Portuguese (e.g. savvy? – possibly
from sabe ‘know’).
relic area

remote structure
A term sometimes used in generative linguistics to refer to
what is more usually known as deep structure.
renewal of connection

reordering (adj./n.) (1)
A term often used within the framework of trans-
formational grammar to refer to a basic kind of transformational operation.
Reordering transformations have the effect of moving constituents (usually
one at a time) from one part of a phrase-marker to another, as in the formation
of passive sentences, or the placement of negatives and afﬁxes. An alternat-
ive term is movement or permutation. In government-binding theory,
reordering involves either adjunction or substitution.
(2)
Reordering is also used in transformational analysis of linguistic change,
referring to differences in the historical sequence of rules which must be
postulated in order to explain the divergences between dialects, forms, etc.
The matter has been discussed mainly with reference to phonology, and various
412
relativized minimality

types of rule-ordering relationships have been suggested, e.g. the distinction
between feeding and bleeding rule-ordering.
repair (n./v.) (1)
A term used in conversation analysis and discourse
analysis to refer to the attempt made by participants in a conversation to make
good (repair) a real or imagined deﬁciency in the interaction (e.g. a mishearing
or misunderstanding). Some repairs are self-initiated (made by a speaker with-
out prompting from the listener), as in the spontaneous use of I mean; some
are other-initiated (prompted by the listener), as in the use of echo questions
such as He said what? Repairs may also be classiﬁed as self-repairs (made by the
speakers themselves) and other-repairs (made by the listeners).
(2)
In phonology, repair is sometimes used to refer to the process of altering
a representation so that it conforms to the structural principles of a model.
For example, in metrical phonology, various strategies are available to ensure
that degenerate feet are repaired (e.g. lengthening, reparsing).
repertoire (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to the range of
languages or varieties of a language available for use by a speaker, each of
which enables the speaker to perform a particular social role; also called a
repertory. The term may also be applied collectively to the range of linguistic
varieties within a speech community.
replacive (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in morphology to refer to a morph
postulated to account for such problematic internal alternations as man ~
men, take ~ took, etc. The ‘replacive morph’ would be stated as a ⇒ e, etc. – a
‘solution’ which morphological theory has generally discounted.
reported speech
see indirect (3)
representation (n.)
A term used, especially in generative linguistics, to refer
to the relationship of correspondence existing between the successive levels of
analysis which are recognized in generating a sentence. The data of language
are represented as a conﬁguration of elements at a given level (e.g. ‘semantic/
phonological/deep-structural/systematic phonetic . . . representation’ of
a sentence), and the rules of the grammar assign structural descriptions to
these representations. For example, in a phonetic representation, an utterance
might be analysed in terms of a matrix where the various rows are labelled
by phonetic features and the columns are successive segments. The notion
has become a central issue in phonological theory, where the question of the
nature and organization of representations has characterized a great deal of
work in non-linear phonology. Different approaches can be distinguished
by their principles of representation – for example, by the way they handle word
phonotactics, phonological alternations, or phonological contrasts –
and the issue of representation is at the centre of several models, notably
underspeciﬁcation theory.
representative (adj./n.)
A term used in the theory of speech acts to refer to a
type of utterance where speakers convey their belief about the truth of a
proposition, as in I state/hypothesize . . .
representative
413

resonance (n.)
A term derived from the physics of sound, and used in acous-
tic phonetics to refer to those vibrations of air movement in the vocal tract
which are set in motion (resonate) by a source of phonation. The main reson-
ance chambers of the vocal tract are the mouth, nose and pharynx, and these
cavities, in their various shapes, act to strengthen some of the frequencies
present in the source of sound, producing the range of human sounds.
resonant (n.)
A term used by some phoneticians to refer to speech sounds
produced at the glottis with a relatively wide articulatory channel, so that
no subsequent audible friction is produced, e.g. vowels, laterals, nasals,
frictionless continuants. The analogous term in distinctive feature theory
is sonorant. In this respect, the category can be opposed to obstruent, where
closure or narrowing is the essential characteristic.
restricted (adj.)
A term used by British sociologist Basil Bernstein (1924–2000)
to refer to one of two varieties (or codes) of language use, introduced as
part of a general theory of the nature of social systems and social roles, the
other being elaborated. Restricted code was thought to be used in relatively
informal situations, stressing the speaker’s membership of a group, was very
reliant on context for its meaningfulness (e.g. there would be several shared
expectations and assumptions between the speakers), and lacked stylistic range.
Linguistically, it was highly predictable, with a relatively high proportion of
such features as pronouns, tag questions, and use of gestures and intona-
tion to convey meaning. Elaborated code, by contrast, was thought to lack
these features. The correlation of restricted code with certain types of social-
class background, and its role in educational settings (e.g. whether children
used to this code will succeed in schools where elaborated code is the norm –
and what should be done in such cases), brought this theory considerable pub-
licity and controversy, and the distinction has since been reinterpreted in
various ways.
restricted language
A term used by some linguists (especially Firthians) to
refer to a reduced linguistic system used for a special communicative purpose,
as in the language of heraldry, or air-trafﬁc control. Alternatively, the notion
may be characterized with reference to ‘restricted contexts’.
restrictive (adj.)
A contrast recognized in the grammatical analysis of phrases,
referring to the semantic relationship of a modifying structure to its accom-
panying head word. In restrictive modiﬁcation, the linguistic identity of the
head is dependent upon the accompanying modiﬁcation; if it is not, the modi-
ﬁcation being inessential, the term non-restrictive is used. The contrast is illus-
trated by the two meanings of the sentence Look at John’s black dog; with the
emphasis on dog, the implication is that John has one dog with him, which
happens to be black (i.e. the modiﬁcation is non-restrictive); but with the
emphasis on black the implication is that John has more than one dog with him,
and our attention is being drawn to the black one (i.e. the blackness is crucial
to the identity of the dog, and the modiﬁcation is thus restrictive). Several areas
of grammar illustrate this contrast, such as relative clauses and appositional
constructions.

restructuring (n.)
see reanalysis (2)
result (adj.)
A term used in grammar and semantics to refer to a clause or
element whose meaning expresses the notion of consequence or effect. Several
features of grammar have a use which has been variously labelled resultative,
resulting or resultant, such as adverbials (e.g. at last, as a result), certain types
of attributive constructions (e.g. He became sad), objects where the referent
exists only because of the activity of the verb (e.g. She’s writing a letter) and
clauses introduced by the conjunctions so or so that (e.g. I went so that I
could see what was happening). In later case grammar, the term replaced fac-
titive, used to refer to an object or being which results from an action or state.
resumptive (adj.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to an element
or structure which repeats or in some way recapitulates the meaning of a prior
element. The chief examples are resumptive pronouns (e.g. Mary, I know her)
and resumptive relative clauses (e.g. The chairman announced the result, an
announcement which had been long awaited).
resyllabify (v.)
see syllable
retraction (n.)
A term used in phonetics to refer to the backwards movement
of an articulator, especially the back of the tongue towards the velum.
Retracted sounds are heard in velarization, or the centralization of front
vowels. The tongue root may also be retracted (see root (2)).
retroﬂex (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made when
the tip of the tongue is curled back in the direction of the front part of the
hard palate – in other words, just behind the alveolar ridge. The degree of
retroﬂexion varies considerably between sounds and dialects. The quality of
r sounds traditionally associated with American English, and with many rural
British English dialects (especially in the South West), illustrates one main group
of retroﬂex sounds, and this quality may also be heard on any vowels preced-
ing a retroﬂexed r (the vowel is said to be ‘r-coloured’ or ‘rhotacized’), as the
tongue may begin to move to a retroﬂex position while the vowel is still being
articulated. Other common retroﬂex consonants are the retroﬂexed correlates
of [t] and [d] – [¡] and [≥] – heard in many Indian languages, such as Hindi,
and also in the English spoken by native-speakers of such languages. [n], [l],
[s] and [z] may also be retroﬂexed.
reversal (n.) (1)
A term used by some psycholinguists to refer to a type of
tongue-slip where two linguistic units are interchanged, as when rabbits
and chickens might become chabbits and rickens. Traditionally, such errors are
referred to as metatheses or spoonerisms.
(2)
A term used in metrical phonology for the switching of weak and strong
nodes encountered in such phrases as thirteen men, so that 
≈
// becomes /
≈
/;
also known as iambic reversal, the rhythm rule, or (after one of the original
examples used to discuss the phenomenon) the thirteen men rule. The metrical
grid, as a consequence, has a structure which is alternating rather than clashing.
reversal
415

reversible (adj.)
see biuniqueness
revised extended standard theory (REST)
The name given to the revised version
of the extended standard theory, proposed by Noam Chomsky (see
Chomskyan) in the mid-1970s, following the adoption of the trace convention
on the application of movement rules. There are several aspects to the ‘revi-
sion’: the base component of the grammar now incorporates the lexical
hypothesis and the X-bar convention; the notion of surface structure is
supplemented by the notion of shallow structure (see S-structure), which
provides the input to the semantic rules (as opposed to the deep structures
of standard theory); there are two semantic components and two levels of
semantic representation (logical form and full semantic representation);
and the descriptive power and number of transformations is much reduced.
rewrite rule
A type of rule in generative grammar, which takes the form X
→ Y; also called a rewriting rule. The symbol to the left of the arrow represents
a single structural element; the symbol to the right of the arrow represents
a string of one or more elements: and the arrow is an instruction to replace
(or ‘expand’) X by Y. Such rules are conventionally read as ‘Rewrite X as Y’;
see further, phrase-structure grammar, environment.
R-expression (n.)
An abbreviation for referring expression, a category in the
three-way classiﬁcation of noun phrases in binding theory, the other two
being anaphors and pronominals. According to principle C of binding theory,
R-expressions must be free. R-expressions include names (e.g. Mary, John) and
deﬁnite DPs (e.g. the cat).
rheme (n.)
In the Prague School approach to linguistics, a term distin-
guished from theme, as part of an analysis of the information structure
of messages, within an overall theoretical framework known as functional
sentence perspective. The rheme is deﬁned as the part of a sentence which
adds most to the advancing process of communication (it has the highest degree
of communicative dynamism); in other words, it expresses the largest amount
of extra meaning, in addition to what has already been communicated. The
theme, by contrast, carries the lowest degree of communicative dynamism. Various
transitional expressions, neither ‘thematic’ nor rhematic, are also recognized.
rhetoric (n.)
In classical approaches to language, the study of effective or
persuasive speaking and writing, especially as practised in public oratory. Several
hundred rhetorical ﬁgures were recognized by classical rhetoricians, classifying
the way words could be arranged in order to achieve special stylistic effects.
Some of these notions have continued in modern stylistic analysis, such as
metaphor, simile, personiﬁcation and paradox. On the whole, however, the
complex terminology of the ancients has been considered too cumbersome for
continued use, and its Latin/Greek provenance of limited applicability to
modern languages. But the study of rhetoric has been given a new lease of life
in modern courses on communication, where the aim is to understand the processes
underlying successful argument and persuasion. Special applications have emerged:
for example, contrastive rhetoric is a hypothesis that the organization of written
416
reversible

text (chieﬂy, formal expository prose) is signiﬁcantly different between languages.
It works within a weak version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, and involves
an application of discourse analysis. A chief objective is educational (see
contrastive analysis): to help foreign-language learners handle the discourse
structures of advanced texts.
rhetorical question

rhotacization (n.)
see rhotic
rhotic (adj.)
A term used in English phonology referring to dialects or
accents where /r/ is pronounced following a vowel, as in car and cart. varieties
which do not have this feature are non-rhotic (such as received pronuncia-
tion). Vowels which occur after retroﬂex consonants are sometimes called
rhotacized (they display rhotacization).
rhyme (n.)
In metrical phonology, a term referring to a single constituent
of syllable structure comprising the nucleus (the non-consonantal segments)
and coda (the ﬁnal sequence of consonantal segments); sometimes also called
the rime (using a less common US spelling to reinforce its technical interpreta-
tion in this context) or core. The notion postulates a close relationship between
these two elements of the syllable, as distinct from the syllable onset (the initial
consonant sequence). Stress is assigned to syllables using only the elements of
the string dominated by rhyme nodes (i.e. onsets are ignored); this principle
is called rhyme projection.
rhythm (n.)
An application of the general sense of this term in phonology, to
refer to the perceived regularity of prominent units in speech. These regular-
ities (of rhythmicality) may be stated in terms of patterns of stressed v.
unstressed syllables, syllable length (long v. short) or pitch (high v. low) –
or some combination of these variables. Maximally regular patterns, such as are
encountered in many kinds of poetry, are referred to as ‘metrical’.
rhythm rule
see reversal (2)
richness of the base
A principle of optimality theory which states that all
valid phonological representations may appear as inputs in any language.
There are no constraints operating on inputs, the contrast here being with
standard generative phonology, where inventories of vowels and consonants
would require speciﬁcation in terms of permitted combinations of features.
The notion of enrichment is controversial when applied to areas outside of
phonology.
right-branching (adj.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to a con-
struction whose complexity is represented on the right-hand side of a tree
diagram. The type of rule involved can be represented by X ⇒ Y + (X). For
example, the phrase the book of the wife of the major . . . is a ‘right-branching’
or ‘right-recursive’ structure; it contrasts with the major’s wife’s book, which is
left-branching, and also with the notion of self-embedding.
right-branching

In grammatical description, a type of sentence in which
one of the constituents appears in ﬁnal position and its canonical position
is ﬁlled by a pronoun with the same reference, e.g. I know her, Julie; He’s
always late, that chap.

right node raising (RNR)
A term used in generative grammar for the type
of co-ordinate construction illustrated by John likes, and Bill hates, writing
letters. It is also known as shared constituent co-ordination. Some grammatical
approaches handle this kind of construction using the notion of ellipsis.
right-recursive (adj.)

rising (adj./n.) (1)
A term used in classifying the linguistic uses of pitch,
referring to a movement from relatively low to relatively high. Rising tones (or
rises) of various kinds (e.g. ‘high/low rising’, ‘rising-falling’) may be encountered
in the study of intonation systems and of tone languages.
(2)
A term used in a two-way classiﬁcation of diphthongs, referring to cases
where the second element of the diphthong receives the maximum prominence
(usually sonority).
(3)
See juncture (1).
role (n.)
In linguistics, an application of the general sense of this term to
refer to the function of an element in a sentence or derivation. It is particu-
larly used in the analysis of syntactic or semantic functions, such as agent or
locative. See also theta role.
role and reference grammar (RRG)
A functionally orientated framework
for grammatical description, in which the choice of a grammatical structure
is determined by an interaction of semantic (i.e. role) factors and pragmatic
or contextual (i.e. reference) factors. The focus is on the structure of the
clause, analysed into a ‘core’ layer (a ‘nuclear’ verb and its associated argu-
ments) and a ‘periphery’ (e.g. adjuncts), and supplemented by a theory of
juncture (how sub-clausal units combine) and a theory of nexus (the types of
syntactic relationship between the units in the juncture). These elemental units
are used in an ‘interclausal grammar’ to analyse the variety of clausal, sentential
and larger constructions found in languages. The approach is lexically based
and makes no use of derivations. It functions by establishing the contextual
418
right dislocation

conditions which govern the pairing of meaning representations to structural
realizations.
roll (n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on
the basis of their manner of articulation. Also known as a rolled consonant,
or a trill, it refers to any sound made by the rapid tapping of one organ of
articulation against another. (vocal-fold vibration is not included in such a
deﬁnition.) Several accents of English use an alveolar rolled [r], as in Welsh
and Scots. French and German are examples of languages where uvular rolled
[R] can be heard.
root (adj./n.) (1)
A term often used in linguistics (and traditionally used in
historical linguistics) as part of a classiﬁcation of the kinds of element
operating within the structure of a word. A root is the base form of a word
which cannot be further analysed without total loss of identity. Putting this
another way, it is that part of the word left when all the afﬁxes are removed.
In the word meaningfulness, for example, removing -ing, -ful and -ness leaves
the root mean. Roots (sometimes referred to as ‘radicals’) may be classiﬁed
in several different ways. They may be ‘free’ morphemes, such as mean (i.e.
they can stand alone as a word), or they may be ‘bound’ morphemes, such as
-ceive (e.g. receive, conceive, deceive). From another point of view, roots are
sometimes classiﬁed as ‘simple’ (i.e. compositionally unanalysable in terms of
morphemes) or ‘complex’/‘compound’ (i.e. certain combinations of simple root
forms, as in blackbird, careful, etc.), though for the latter the term stem is
commonly used.
From a semantic point of view, the root generally carries the main component
of meaning in a word. From a historical viewpoint, the root is the earliest form
of a word, though this information is not relevant to a synchronic analysis
(and may not always coincide with the results of it). The term root-inﬂected
is sometimes applied to a type of language where the inﬂections affect the
internal phonological structure of the root, as in Arabic, where roots are
deﬁned as a sequence of consonants (CvCvC), and variation in the intervening
vowels signals such grammatical differences as present v. past tense. By
contrast, a language such as Chinese may be said to be root-isolating, i.e. the
root morphemes are invariable, and grammatical relationships are signalled by
other means, such as word-order.
(2)
The furthest-back part of the tongue, opposite the pharyngeal wall, not
normally involved in the production of speech sounds; also called the radix
(articulations may therefore be described as radical). It is, however, involved in
advanced tongue root (ATR) articulation – a movement which expands the
front–back diameter of the pharynx, used phonologically in some (e.g. African)
languages as a factor in contrasts of vowel harmony. The opposite direction
of movement is retracted tongue root (RTR).
(3)
In generative grammar, the term is sometimes used to refer to the
topmost node in a tree diagram. In non-linear phonology, the root node is
the one which dominates all other features in the hierarchy; for example in
metrical phonology, it refers to the topmost node in a metrical tree (R). In
transformational grammar it also refers to a type of transformation which
root
419

applies only to full sentence structure and not to embedded sentences. A
root transformation applies in the formation of YES–NO questions, for instance,
where the domain of application has to be the main clause (e.g. He said that
there was trouble ⇒ Did he say that there was trouble?).
root-and-pattern
A term applied to the morphology of certain languages
(notably Semitic languages), referring to the way in which a stable conson-
antal sequence (the ‘root’) appears in several related words of varying seg-
mental shape; for example, from such Arabic forms as katab ‘write’ and kaatib
‘writing’ one may identify a root pattern k-t-b. The notion has attracted
particular attention in non-linear phonology, because it is a motivation for
the skeletal tier of representation. In this context, the phenomenon is handled
by the mapping of consonantal roots to skeletal templates, each template
deﬁning the basic shape for a particular morphological category.
round brackets
see bracketing
rounding (n.)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of lip position in phonetics,
referring to the visual appearance of the lips when they assume a rounded shape,
as in the ‘close rounding’ of [u] and the more ‘open rounding’ of [Ñ]. Each of the
vowel positions on the cardinal vowel diagram has both a rounded and an
unrounded form, e.g. [i] v. [y], [e] v. [ø]. Lip position is of particular phono-
logical signiﬁcance in the analysis of vowel and semi-vowel qualities.
The opposition rounded/non-rounded has special status in Chomsky and Halle’s
distinctive feature theory of phonology (see Chomskyan), where it handles
variations in place of articulation (cavity features), specifying lip position.
‘Rounded’ sounds are deﬁned articulatorily, as those produced with a narrowing
of the lips, as in [w], [u], etc. Its opposite is non-rounded, referring to sounds
produced without any such narrowing, as in English front vowels.
routine (adj./n.)

RP
see received pronunciation
rule (n.)
A term used in linguistics, and especially in generative grammar,
to refer to a formal statement of correspondence between linguistic elements or
structures. In the case of generative rules, there is more involved than a set of
descriptive statements summarizing one’s observations; generative rules are pre-
dictive, expressing a hypothesis about the relationships between sentences which
will hold for the language as a whole, and which reﬂect the native-speaker’s
competence. In the classical account, a grammar is seen as a set of rewrite
rules which will generate all and only the grammatical sentences of a language.
The rules may be subclassiﬁed in terms of the components of the grammar in
which they appear (e.g. ‘phonological rules’, ‘syntactic rules’, ‘lexical rules’).
Several types of rules have been recognized. The most basic types are phrase-
structure rules, of the form X ⇒ Y, and transformational rules, of the
form A ⇒ B, where A and B are strings of structural elements. In Syntactic
Structures (1957) a distinction was made between optional and obligatory
rules. Other types of rule commonly cited include recursive, global, movement,
420
root-and-pattern

readjustment, variable, lexical insertion and lexical redundancy rules
(see lexis). In some later models of generative grammar, the notion of a rule
schema is introduced. This is a means of specifying a set of rules without having
to list them individually, e.g. S ⇒ Sn, where n refers to any number of sentences
(greater than 1) that can be the result of this rule (as in co-ordinate sentences,
which may be of any length). In generalized phrase-structure grammar, refer-
ence is made to immediate dominance rules and linear precedence rules.
In government-binding theory there has been a shift away from the notion
of rules to that of principles and parameters; in optimality theory to the
notion of constraints.
The linguistic sense thus contrasts with the traditional use of the term, where
rules are recommendations for correct usage, as in ‘a preposition is not to be
used at the end of a sentence’. No prescriptive or proscriptive implication is
present in the linguistic sense of ‘rule’. See also category, construe, cycle,
dependency grammar, expression (2), formation rule, norm, nucleus,
projection, sandhi, word-formation.
rule features
A term used in classical transformational grammar (see Aspects
model) to refer to one of the types of (binary) features which are contained in
a lexical entry (the others being inherent features and contextual features),
and which provides information as to whether a lexical item is exceptional
with reference to the applicability of a non-lexical transformation (e.g.
passivization). This type of feature is symbolized as [−Passive], [−Equi], etc.
If a rule does have lexical exceptions, it is said to be governed (otherwise
ungoverned).
rule-ordering paradox
In phonological theory, a term sometimes used to
characterize violations of the condition on consistent rule ordering stipu-
lated in early generative phonology. Approaches which permit such violations
require A < B in some derivations and B < A in others.
rule-to-rule (adj.)
A term sometimes used in theoretical linguistics, arising
out of Montague grammar, to refer to a view of language (the ‘rule-to-
rule hypothesis’) which maintains that each syntactic rule in a grammar
is associated with a semantic rule which determines the meaning of the
constituent whose form is speciﬁed by the syntactic rule.

S
S′
An abbreviation used in generative grammar for a clause introduced by
a subordinating conjunction or complementizer. In government-binding
theory, it is assumed that such clauses are headed by the complementizer,
and hence they are labelled CP (see cp).
SAAD
An abbreviation sometimes used to refer to the kernel sentences gener-
ated by a grammar – standing for simple–active–afﬁrmative–declarative.
sandhi /csandip/ (adj./n.)
A term used in syntax and morphology to refer to
the phonological modiﬁcation of grammatical forms which have been
juxtaposed. The term comes from a Sanskrit word meaning ‘joining’. Sandhi
forms are forms which have undergone speciﬁc modiﬁcations in speciﬁc circum-
stances (i.e. various sandhi rules have applied). assimilation and dissimila-
tion are two widespread tendencies which could be classiﬁed under this heading.
The merit of the sandhi notion is that it can be used as a very general term
within which can be placed a wide range of structural tendencies that otherwise
it would be difﬁcult to interrelate. In languages where sandhi forms are com-
plex, a distinction is sometimes made between external sandhi (sandhi rules
which operate across word boundaries) and internal sandhi (rules which operate
within words). See also tone.
Sapir–Whorf hypothesis
A theory of the relationship between language and
thought expounded in its most explicit form by the American anthropolo-
gical linguists Edward Sapir (1884–1939) and Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897–
1941). Also known as the theory of linguistic relativity, the hypothesis
states (in the words of Whorf) that ‘we dissect nature along lines laid down by
our native languages . . . by the linguistic systems in our minds.’ The differences
in world-view imposed by different languages have, however, proved extremely
difﬁcult to elucidate or test experimentally, and the fact of successful bilingual
translation weakens the force of the theory’s claims; as a result, the Sapir–
Whorf hypothesis has made little impact on contemporary psycholinguistics,
though the 1990s saw a renewed interest from cognitive psycholinguists and
others.

satellite (n.)
A term used in functional grammar to refer to those elements
which turn a nuclear predication into a full predication. Satellites specify
further properties of the nuclear state of affairs expressed in a sentence – such
as manner, temporal and locative.
satem language /cswptvm/
see centum language
satisfaction (n.)
see constraint
saturation (n.)
In logic and semantics, a term used for the combining of a
predicate or function with its arguments. A predicate is said to be saturated
if all of its argument slots are ﬁlled with arguments.
Saussurean/Saussurian (adj./n.)
Characteristic of, or a follower of, the principles
of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), especially as outlined in his posthumous
Cours de linguistique générale (Paris, 1913), ﬁrst translated by W. Baskin as
Course in General Linguistics (New York, 1959). His conception of language
as a system of mutually deﬁning entities was a major inﬂuence on several schools
of linguistics (e.g. the Prague School, Geneva School, glossematics),
and most of the theoretical distinctions he introduced have become foundations
of linguistic study. Chief among these are the notions of langue and parole,
syntagmatic and paradigmatic, synchronic and diachronic, and signiﬁant
and signiﬁé.
SC
An abbreviation used in generative grammar to refer to structural
change. In government-binding theory, it is an abbreviation for small
clause, especially in contexts where linguists want to avoid taking a stand on
what the correct label for this constituent is!
scalar expressions
In semantics and pragmatics, expressions which involve
scales in their interpretation. They include logical quantiﬁers (e.g. all, some),
quantifying determiners (e.g. few, half ), quantifying time expressions (e.g.
always, often), scalar adverbs (almost, only, more than), and scalar predic-
ates (e.g. love, like; must, shall). The nature of such scales is controversial,
being conceived both in terms of strength (e.g. ‘all is stronger than some’) and
of direction (almost and more activate a scale which is in a positive direction, by
contrast with the negative direction of only and less than).
scale-and-category grammar
A linguistic theory devised by the British linguist
M. A. K. Halliday (see Hallidayan) in the early 1960s in which the structure
of language is seen as an intersecting set of scales and categories operating
at different levels. Several levels of organization are recognized. At the level
of substance, the physical data of speech or writing are deﬁned in phonic
or graphic terms. The organization of substance into linguistic contrasts is
carried out at the level of form, grammar and lexis being the two main
subdivisions. phonology is seen as an ‘inter-level’ connecting the level of sub-
stance and form. context is a further ‘inter-level’, connecting the level of form
with the extralinguistic situation. Linguistic analysis in this view proceeds
scale-and-category grammar
423

by establishing four theoretical ‘categories’ – units, structures, classes and
systems – and interrelating these by the ‘scales’ of rank, exponence and delic-
acy. (This use of ‘scale’ should not be confused with that found in phonology,
in relation to strength values.) In the late 1960s, parts of this approach were
superseded by a systemic model of analysis.
scansion (n.)
An application in some approaches to non-linear phonology
of a term used in traditional metrics (where it refers to the analysis of verse
rhythm) for the analysis of certain rhythmic properties of speech. A phonolo-
gical representation can be scanned to determine its properties – in particular,
to determine whether it satisﬁes the locality condition at various levels in the
feature hierarchy. In one approach, two kinds of scansion are recognized:
in minimal scansion, a rule scans a tier which contains a target node/feature;
in maximal scansion, a rule scans the highest level of syllabic structure
providing access to a target node/feature. In metrical phonology, the level of
scansion is the highest grid level where eurhythmy is relevant as a com-
ponent of the phonology. It is typically one level down from the level of the
stress peak.
schema (n.), plural schemata (1)
A term used in psycholinguistics, especially
in the study of reading, for a mental structure in which knowledge is organized.
schema theory has been developed to explain how people use background
knowledge to shape their expectations about what a text (spoken or written)
will contain. Readers create mental models (schemata) which they actively use
to make sense of a text. See also image schema.
(2)
See rule.
schwa/shwa /àwwp/ (n.)
The usual name for the neutral vowel [v], heard in
English at the beginning of such words as ago, amaze, or in the middle of
afterwards; sometimes called the indeﬁnite vowel. It is a particularly frequent
vowel in English, as it is the one most commonly heard when a stressed vowel
becomes unstressed, e.g. telegraph becoming telegraphy /ctelvìrwpf/ v. /tvcleìrvﬁ/.
It is also the usual pronunciation of the vowel in such words as the, a, an, and.
The term ‘schwa’ comes from the German name of a vowel of this central
quality found in Hebrew.
scope (n.)
A term originating in logic, and now widely used in syntax, seman-
tics and pragmatics. In its strictest sense, scope is deﬁned syntactically: if an
operator O combines with some other expression E, then E is the scope of O.
However, the term is often used more loosely to refer to that stretch of language
affected by the meaning of a particular form, even if it does not coincide with
the scope of that form as just deﬁned. As a general illustration, in English the
scope of negation typically extends from the negative word until the end of the
clause; this therefore allows such semantic contrasts as I deliberately didn’t
ask her (= ‘I acted deliberately in not asking her’) and I didn’t deliberately ask
her (= ‘It is not true that I deliberately asked her’). adverbials, interrogative
forms and quantiﬁers are among the expressions which are often analysed in
424
scansion

terms of scope. Sentences where there is an ambiguity deriving from alternative
scope interpretations are said to exhibit a scope ambiguity.
scrambling (n.)
In some approaches to syntax, an optional rule proposed
to handle the way constituents permute in free word-order languages
(e.g. Latin); for example, the string A+B+C+D could become A+C+B+D. The
factors which inﬂuence scrambling (e.g. the elements which are affected, and the
direction in which they move) may be stylistic in character. A distinction is
drawn between ‘short-distance scrambling’ (within a clause) and the less usual
‘long-distance scrambling’ (across a clause boundary).
script (n.)
see transcription
S′-deletion
An operation in early government-binding theory which deletes
an S′-node dominating an S-node in a complement clause. By deleting this
node, the boundary between the matrix verb and the complement clause is
weakened, so that the matrix verb can exceptionally case-mark the complement
subject (subject-to-object raising) or properly govern the complement subject
position (subject-to-subject raising). See also exceptional case marking.
secondary aperture
One of the types of sound feature set up by Chomsky and
Halle (see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology,
to handle variations in place of articulation (cavity features). It subsumes
nasal and lateral features, both deﬁned as oppositions.
secondary articulation
In a sound produced with two points of articulation,
this term refers to the point of articulation involving the lesser degree of stric-
ture, e.g. labialization, palatalization; opposed to primary articulation.
See also the distinction between ‘major’ and ‘minor’ in the context of phono-
logy (see major (2)).
secondary cardinal vowels
see cardinal vowels
secondary response
A term introduced into linguistics by Leonard Bloomﬁeld
(see Bloomﬁeldian) to refer to utterances people make about their language.
The term includes not only the metalinguistic utterances of linguistics but
also the loosely organized, yet fairly uniform system of popular pronouncements
about language, e.g. ‘bad grammar’, ‘correct pronunciation’. It is distinguished
from ‘primary’ response (the use of language as such) and tertiary response
(the evaluation of secondary responses).

segment (n.)
A term used in phonetics and linguistics primarily to refer to
any discrete unit that can be identiﬁed, either physically or auditorily, in the
stream of speech. Segmentation can take place using either physical or auditory
criteria: in the former case, acoustic or articulatory change-points can be
identiﬁed as boundaries of segments; in the latter case, perceptible changes in
quality or quantity, often showing the inﬂuence of the language’s phonemic
units, are the basis of division. The term is especially used in phonetics, where
the smallest perceptible discrete unit is referred to as a phone. A feature which
begins or ends within one of the phases of articulation of a segment is called a
subsegmental feature (see onset). ‘Segment’ has developed an abstract sense in
generative phonology, where it is used for a mental unit of phonological
organization – one of a series of minimal units which, however, are not strung
together in a simple linear way. In this model, no physical reality is being
segmented. See also null.
In phonology, a major division is often made into segmental and supraseg-
mental (or non-segmental) categories. Segmental phonology analyses the speech
into distinctive units, or phonemes (= ‘segmental phonemes’), which have a
fairly direct correspondence with phonetic segments (alternative approaches in-
volve analysis in terms of distinctive features and prosodies). Suprasegmental
or non-segmental phonology analyses those features of speech which extend
over more than one segment, such as intonation or (in some theories) vowel
harmony.
The above terminology has been applied analogously to the study of written
texts, where graphs and graphemes are some of the segments identiﬁed. The
term is also found in the analysis of higher linguistic units, such as morphemes
or words, as in structuralist analyses of grammar (see immediate-
constituent analysis). In generative syntax, a segment refers to each layer of
the same label created in Chomsky-adjunction structure; the notion is used in
association with category.
segmental tier
see phoneme
segmentator (n.)
A device used in instrumental phonetics which plays back a
recording of speech at varying small time intervals, thus allowing a more detailed
study of the segments produced.

selectional feature/restriction/rule
A term in generative grammar for a
type of contextual feature, i.e. a syntactic feature which speciﬁes the con-
ditions relating to where in a deep structure a lexical item can occur.
Selectional features specify the restrictions on the permitted combinations of lexical
items within a given grammatical context. These restrictions are stated with
reference to the relevant inherent features in an adjacent or nearby complex
symbol (within the same structural unit, i.e. they must be clause-mates). For
example, a verb which requires an animate subject noun phrase (cf. *the
stone slept) would have the restriction stated as part of its feature speciﬁca-
tion, e.g. as [+[+Animate]]. In government-binding theory, category selection
426
segment

(c-selection) and semantic selection (s-selection) are distinguished. C-selection
refers to the category required in a certain environment (e.g. the sister
constituent of the verb depend must be a prepositional phrase); s-selection
is forced by the semantics of the governing verb (e.g. John ate the ocean violates
the s-selectional requirements of eat).
selective listening
A term derived from the notion of selective attention in psy-
chology, and used in psycholinguistics to refer to the process whereby people
are able to pick out certain aspects of a speech signal and to ignore others. The
cocktail party phenomenon characterizes the problem – how a person is able
to attend selectively to one out of several simultaneously occurring conversa-
tions. Analysis of the factors which affect this ability (e.g. the semantic content
of the conversations, the speed of the speech) suggests several conclusions which
are of major importance in developing a theory of speech perception – for
instance, that connected speech cannot be perceived as a series of isolated
segments.
self-embedding (adj./n.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to a
construction in which a constituent belonging to some category is inside
a larger constituent of the same category; also known as centre-embedding.
Self-embedding constructions can be illustrated from relative clauses, such as
The dog that the cat scratched ran away. Here, the sentence which underlies
the relative clause (The cat scratched the dog) is embedded within the sentence
The dog ran away. The process can continue indeﬁnitely, but the acceptability
of this construction deteriorates with the number of self-embeddings, cf. ?The
dog that the cat that the man bought scratched ran away. These problems have
stimulated considerable discussion concerning the psychological mechanisms
that need to be assumed to explain linguistic behaviour, reference being made
to alternative processes of sentence formation, such as right-branching and
left-branching constructions.
self-repair (n.)
see repair
semantic component
see semantic feature
semantic differential
A technique devised by psychologists to ﬁnd out the
emotional reactions of speakers to lexical items, and thus suggest the main
affective dimensions in terms of which a language’s concepts are organized.
It is little used in linguistic semantics.
semantic feature
In semantics, a minimal contrastive element of a word’s
meaning; in some approaches, called a semantic component. Girl, for example,
might be analysed into such features as ‘young’, ‘female’ and ‘human’. In child
language acquisition, the semantic feature hypothesis (SFH) claims that the
order of appearance of a child’s lexical items is governed by the type and
complexity of the semantic features they contain.
semantic ﬁeld

427

semanticity (n.)
A very general deﬁning property of language (and other semi-
otic systems): the ability of a system to convey meaning, by virtue of the
associative ties which relate the system’s signals to features of the external
world.
semantic meaning
see meaning, semantics
semantic prosody
A term sometimes used in corpus-based lexicology to
describe a word which typically co-occurs with other words that belong to a
particular semantic set. For example, utterly co-occurs regularly with words of
negative evaluation (e.g. utterly appalling).
semantic relations
see sense
semantic role
A term used in syntax and semantics to refer to the semantic
relations that link a predicate to its arguments in the description of a situ-
ation. Thus in the sentence Roger milked the cow the entities are related by the
action described by the verb: Roger as the volitional instigator is often termed
the agent; and the cow as the affected entity, the patient. There is no general
agreement on the number of participant roles available to speakers of
languages, but others include: instrument, the means by which an action is
performed or something comes about; theme, the entity which is moved by an
action, or whose location is described; experiencer, the entity which is aware
of the action described by the predicate but which is not in control; beneﬁci-
ary, the entity for whose beneﬁt the action was performed; location (locative),
the place in which something is situated or takes place; goal, the entity or place
towards which something moves; and source, the entity or place from which
something moves. It has been suggested that these roles may be subsumed into
two main types: the macro-roles of actor and undergoer, or, in an alternative
terminology, the proto-roles of agent and patient. These roles have been important
in the establishment of semantic classes of verbs. Other names for these roles
include deep semantic cases, functional roles, participant roles, and, especially in
Chomskyan linguistics, thematic (or theta, θ) roles.
semantics (n.)
A major branch of linguistics devoted to the study of mean-
ing in language. The term is also used in philosophy and logic, but not with
the same range of meaning or emphasis as in linguistics. Philosophical semantics
examines the relations between linguistic expressions and the phenomena in
the world to which they refer, and considers the conditions under which such
expressions can be said to be true or false, and the factors which affect the
interpretation of language as used. Its history of study, which reaches back to
the writings of Plato and Aristotle, in the twentieth century includes the work of
such philosophers and logicians as Charles Peirce (1839–1914), Rudolf Carnap
(1891–1970) and Alfred Tarski (1902–83), particularly under the heading
of semiotics and the ‘philosophy of language’. ‘Logical’ or ‘pure’ semantics
(formal semantics) is the study of the meaning of expressions in terms of logical
systems of analysis, or calculi, and is thus more akin to formal logic or math-
ematics than to linguistics.
428
semanticity

In linguistics, the emphasis is on the study of the semantic properties of natural
languages (as opposed to logical ‘languages’), the term ‘linguistic semantics’
often being employed to make the distinction clear (though this is not a conven-
tion needed in this dictionary, where the term ‘semantics’ is used without quali-
ﬁcation to refer to its linguistic sense). Different linguists’ approaches to meaning
none the less illustrate the inﬂuence of general philosophical or psychological
positions. The ‘behaviourist’ semantics of Leonard Bloomﬁeld (see Bloom-
ﬁeldian), for example, refers to the application of the techniques of the beha-
viourist movement in psychology, restricting the study of meaning to only
observable and measurable behaviour. Partly because of the pessimism of this
approach, which concluded that semantics was not yet capable of elucidation in
behavioural terms, semantics came to be much neglected in post-Bloomﬁeldian
linguistics, and has received proper attention only since the 1960s.
Of particular importance here is the approach of structural semantics, which
displays the application of the principles of structural linguistics to the study
of meaning through the notion of semantic relations (sense or ‘meaning’
relations such as synonymy and antonymy). Semantic meaning may here be
used, in contradistinction to ‘grammatical meaning’. The linguistic structuring
of semantic space is also a major concern of generative linguistics, where the
term ‘semantic’ is widely used in relation to the grammar’s organization (one
section being referred to as the semantic component) and to the analysis of
sentences (in terms of a semantic representation) and of lexical items (in terms
of semantic features). However, the relation between syntax and semantics
in this approach is a matter of controversy. Other terms used to distinguish
features of meaning in this and other theories include ‘semantic markers/
distinguishers/properties’ and (in an unrelated sense to the above) ‘semantic
components’ (see componential). Linguists have also built on results in logical
and philosophical semantics to develop theories in which truth conditions,
reference and the logical properties of natural language expressions play a
central role (truth-conditional semantics, model-theoretic semantics).
A very different direction has been taken in cognitive semantics, drawing
on psychology and focusing on the role of conceptualization in interpretation.
The inﬂuence of mathematical and computational models is also evident:
state-transition semantics, for example, is an analysis of natural language
meanings in terms of a series of states and state transitions in a language user
(see automata).
Semantic ﬁeld theory is an approach which developed in the 1930s; it took
the view that the vocabulary of a language is not simply a listing of independ-
ent items (as the headwords in a dictionary would suggest), but is organized
into areas, or ﬁelds, within which words interrelate and deﬁne each other
in various ways. The words denoting colour are often cited as an example of a
semantic ﬁeld: the precise meaning of a colour word can be understood only
by placing it in relation to the other terms which occur with it in demarcating
the colour spectrum. Other areas of semantics include the diachronic study
of word meanings (etymology), the synchronic analysis of word usage
(lexicology), and the compilation of dictionaries (lexicography). An import-
ant current debate is the distinction between semantics and pragmatics, focus-
ing in particular on the incursion of pragmatic theories into traditional semantic
areas. See also general (1), prototype.

semantic selection
see selectional feature
semantic triangle
A particular model of meaning which claimed that mean-
ing is essentially a threefold relationship between linguistic forms, concepts and
referents. It was proposed by C. K. Ogden (1889–1957) and I. A. Richards
(1893–1979) in the 1920s, in their book The Meaning of Meaning.

A term used in semantic theory, especially in formal semant-
ics, for any of various items associated by rule with a linguistic expression.
Examples include the expression’s extension or intension.
semasiology (n.)
see semiotics
seme (n.)
A term used by some European linguists (e.g. Eugen Coseriu (1921–
2002)), to refer to minimal distinctive semantic features operating within a
speciﬁc semantic ﬁeld, e.g. the various deﬁning properties of cups v. glasses,
such as ‘having a handle’, ‘made of glass’. In this approach, semes contrast with
classemes, which are features of a much more general kind, e.g. ‘male’, ‘animate’.
semeiology, semeiotics (n.)
see semiotics
semelfactive (adj./n.)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of aspect, to
refer to an event which takes place once only, as commonly happens with such
verbs as sneeze, knock, etc. (‘semelfactive verbs’, or ‘semelfactives’). It is regularly
contrasted with iterative.
sememe (n.)
A term used in some semantic theories to refer to a minimal unit
of meaning. For some, a sememe is equivalent to the meaning of a morpheme;
for others it is a feature of meaning, equivalent to the notion of ‘semantic
component’ or ‘semantic feature’ in some theories. The term sememics is used
as part of the description of strata in stratiﬁcational grammar; the sememic
stratum, which handles the systems of semantic relationship between lexical
items, is here distinguished from the hypersememic stratum, at which is analysed
the relationship between language and the external world. Semotactics, in this
approach, involves the study of the sequential arrangement of sememes.
semi-auxiliary (adj./n.)
see auxiliary (1)
semi-consonant (n.)
see consonant
semilattice (n.)
see lattice
semilingual (adj./n.)
A term sometimes used in sociolinguistics and language
teaching, referring to people who have acquired two or more languages, but
who lack a native level of proﬁciency in any of them. The situation is likely to
arise with people who have moved between countries a great deal in their early
years. Semilingualism has been little studied, and is controversial, as it suggests
that there are people who do not have a true mother-tongue; however, many
people do claim to be semilingual. The term is also used to describe people who
430
semantic selection

have made signiﬁcant progress, though not achieving complete ﬂuency, in learning
a language.
semiotics (n.)
The scientiﬁc study of the properties of signalling systems, whether
natural or artiﬁcial. In its oldest sense, it refers to the study within philosophy of
sign and symbol systems in general (also known as semiotic, semeiotics, semiology,
semasiology, semeiology, signiﬁcs). In this approach, linguistic, psychological,
philosophical and sociological characteristics of communicative systems are studied
together. The philosophers Charles Peirce (1834–1914), Charles Morris (1901–
1979) and later Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) saw the ﬁeld as divisible into three
areas: semantics, the study of the relations between linguistic expression and
the objects in the world which they refer to or describe; syntactics, the study
of the relation of these expressions to each other; and pragmatics, the study of
the dependence of the meaning of these expressions on their users (including the
social situation in which they are used).
In the second part of the twentieth century, the term ‘semiotics’ came to be
applied to the analysis of patterned human communication in all its sensory
modes, i.e. hearing, sight, taste, touch and smell. Semiotic studies in this sense
vary in the degree to which they have progressed: this emphasis has been taken
up mainly by anthropologists, linguists, psychologists and sociologists. The branch
of the subject which has received most study is the vocal–auditory mode,
primarily through the subjects of phonetics and linguistics. The study of
visual communication is known as kinesics. The study of touch behaviour (and
associated phenomena, such as body orientation and distance between people)
is often called proxemics. Gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) systems of
communication have received more study in relation to animal communication.
The extension of the subject to the analysis of animal systems of communication
is known as zoösemiotics.
Particularly in Europe, semiotic (or semiological) analysis has developed as part
of an attempt to analyse all aspects of communication as systems of signals
(semiotic systems), such as music, eating, clothes and dance, as well as language.
In this area, the French writer Roland Barthes (1915–80) has exercised particular
inﬂuence.
semi-passive (n.)
see passive
semi-productive (adj.)
see productivity
semi-sentence (n.)
A term used by some grammarians to refer to sentences
whose grammaticality or acceptability is doubtful, but where there is suf-
ﬁcient plausibility of interpretation to make one unhappy about a deﬁnite
judgement of ungrammaticality. For example, in certain contexts (e.g. poetry)
a sentence might seem acceptable, which elsewhere would be rejected as
ungrammatical (e.g. the breaking of selectional rules in all the moon long . . . ).
semi-vowel (n.)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on the
basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to a sound functioning as a
consonant but lacking the phonetic characteristics normally associated with
consonants (such as friction or closure); instead, its quality is phonetically
semi-vowel
431

that of a vowel; though, occurring as it does at the margins of a syllable, its
duration is much less than that typical of vowels. The common examples in
English are [w] and [j], as in wet and yet respectively. Some phoneticians refer to
these sounds as a type of approximant.
semology (n.)
A major component recognized in stratiﬁcational gram-
mar, comprising the stratal systems of sememics and hypersememics (or
semantics). The component deals with the statement of meanings, both in
terms of semantic features, and in terms of referential/cognitive meaning.
semotactics (n.)
see sememe, taxis
sense (n.)
In semantics, this term is usually contrasted with reference, as part
of an explication of the notion of meaning. Reference, or denotation, is seen
as extralinguistic – the entities, states of affairs, etc. in the external world
which a linguistic expression stands for. Sense, on the other hand, refers to the
system of linguistic relationships (sense relations or semantic relations) which a
lexical item contracts with other lexical items – the paradigmatic relation-
ships of synonymy, antonymy, etc., and the syntagmatic relationships of
collocation. In semantic theories deriving from the work of German logician
Gottlob Frege (1848–1925), the sense of an expression is a ‘mode of presenta-
tion’ of the expression’s referent, and also serves indirectly as the expression’s
referent in opaque contexts. In possible-worlds semantics, the sense of an
expression is a function mapping each possible world (or world–time pair)
onto the expression’s extension relative to that world (or pair); also called
intension.
sense association

sensitivity (n.)

sentence (n.)
The largest structural unit in terms of which the grammar
of a language is organized. Innumerable deﬁnitions of sentence exist, ranging
from the vague characterizations of traditional grammar (such as ‘the expres-
sion of a complete thought’) to the detailed structural descriptions of contem-
porary linguistic analysis. Most linguistic deﬁnitions of the sentence show
the inﬂuence of Leonard Bloomﬁeld (see Bloomﬁeldian), who pointed to
the structural autonomy, or independence, of the notion of sentence: it is ‘not
included by virtue of any grammatical construction in any larger linguistic form’.
Research has also attempted to discover larger grammatical units (of discourse,
or text), but so far little has been uncovered comparable to the sentence, whose
constituent structure is stateable in formal, distributional terms.
Linguistic discussion of the sentence has focused on problems of identiﬁcation,
classiﬁcation and generation. Identifying sentences is relatively straightforward
in the written language, but is often problematic in speech, where intonation
and pause may give uncertain clues as to whether a sentence boundary exists.
Classiﬁcation of sentence structure proceeds along many different lines, e.g. the
binary constituent procedures of immediate-constituent analysis, or the
hierarchical analyses of Hallidayan and other grammars (sentences being
432
semology

seen as composites of clauses, which in turn are analysed into phrases, etc.).
In generative grammar, likewise, there are several models of analysis for sentence
structure, with competing views as to the direction in which a sentence deriva-
tion should proceed. Certain analytic problems are shared by all approaches,
e.g. how to handle elliptical sentences (or ‘sentence fragments’), such as
To town (in answer to Where are you going?); how to handle cross-reference
between sentences, such as She’s writing (‘sentence connectivity’); and how
to handle the minor, non-productive sentence types in a language (e.g. Yes,
Please, How do you do?).
Most analysts agree on the need to recognize a functional classiﬁcation of
sentences into statement, question, command and exclamatory types. There
is also widespread recognition (albeit with varying terminology) of a formal
classiﬁcation into declarative, interrogative, imperative and exclamative
types.
Most analyses also recognize some such classiﬁcation of ‘sentence patterns’ into
simple v. complex or compound types, i.e. consisting of one subject–predicate
unit, as opposed to more than one. Whether one calls this subject–predicate unit
a clause or a ‘simple’ sentence, or uses some other term depends on one’s
model of analysis – but something analogous to this unit emerges in all theories,
e.g. NP + VP, actor–action–goal, Subject–Verb–Object. Likewise, the number
of formal sentence types recognized, and how they are best deﬁned, has been
and remains controversial. Several linguists insist on making a systematic dis-
tinction between sentence (a theoretical unit, deﬁned by a grammar) and utter-
ance (a physical unit, a matter of speech production or performance): in this
view, utterances can be analysed in terms of sentences, but utterances do not
‘consist of’ sentences.

sentential relative clause
A type of relative clause which modiﬁes the whole
of the preceding sentence, instead of only a noun. An example is John loves
ﬂying – which amazes me.
sequence (n.)
An application of the general sense of this term in linguistics
and phonetics, referring to the observable succession of units in an utter-
ance or text. This sequence may be linear, where the dependencies are made
between successive, adjacent units (the–big–cat–is . . . ), but it may involve
non-linear relationships, as in agreement between words which are separated
by other structures. Sometimes a speciﬁc sequential correspondence is given
a separate label, as in the traditional term ‘sequence of tenses’, referring to
the dependencies between tense forms in successive clauses (e.g. if he enters,
sequence
433

he will win, but not * . . . he had won), or the ‘sequencing’ patterns analysed in
dialogue (as in the greeting ritual in conversational openings) which form part
of the subject-matter of discourse analysis and text linguistics. Sequencing is
also occasionally used, especially in psychologically inﬂuenced studies, to refer
to the inﬂuence successive structures exercise upon each other (as seen, for
example, in the difﬁculty some language-disordered patients have in sequencing
appropriately a set of linguistic units). This use is quite different from the term
‘sequencing’ in language teaching, where it refers to the order in which a graded
series of items is presented to the learner. The structure of linguistic sequences
constitutes the province of syntagmatic analysis. The term is often distin-
guished from the more abstract notion of order.
serial relationship
A term sometimes used in linguistics, and especially in
Quirk grammar, to refer to a theory which recognizes gradience between
syntactic categories. In a matrix of the type:
A
B
C
a
+
−
−
b
+
+
−
c
+
+
+
B would be said to be serially related to A and C. An analogous notion is that
of syntactic blending.
serial verb
In syntax, a type of construction for a sequence of verbs or verb
phrases within a clause (or a sequence of clauses) in which the syntactic relation-
ship between the items is left unmarked. The verbs share a semantic argument,
but there is no conjunction or inﬂection to mark co-ordination or sub-
ordination: for example, in the Yoruba sentence O ra eran je (‘3rd-person buy
meat eat’) ‘meat’ is simultaneously the object of both verbs. The verbs may both
be main verbs or vary in their syntactic status (e.g. one might function more like
an auxiliary or a particle). Serial verb construction is not an important
feature of English, though it can be seen in such sentences as I’ll go see (see
catenative).
series (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to any set of
consonant sounds which has at least one phonetic feature in common, and is
distinguished in terms of place of articulation. For example, the voiced
plosive ‘series’ includes [b]–[d]–[ì], the nasal series [m]–[n]–[º], etc.

s-ﬁx (n.)
In the demisyllabic analysis of syllables, an optional afﬁx attached
to the right of a syllabic core; also called a sufﬁx. The point of division between
core and sufﬁx is shown notationally by a dot.

shadow pronoun
see resumptive pronoun
shallow (adj.)
A term used in the revised extended standard theory of
generative grammar, to refer to a level of representation distinct from
(syntactic) surface structure. Shallow structure differs from surface struc-
ture principally in the way it is followed within the grammar by certain types of
formal operation other than phonological rules – ﬁlters, deletion and
stylistic rules. The term has also been used in the work of some generative
grammarians to refer to the output of cyclic transformations, whereas in
REST it refers to the output of post-cyclic transformations. In government-
binding theory, shallow structure is known as S-structure.
shared constituent co-ordination
see right node raising
sharp (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Jakobson and Halle (see
Jakobsonian) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, to help
handle secondary articulations – in this case, palatalization. ‘Sharp’
consonants are deﬁned both articulatorily and acoustically as sounds
produced with the tongue being raised towards the hard palate during their
articulation, and with a relatively wide area behind the stricture; there is a
consequent greater intensity of some of the higher frequencies of the sound
spectrum. All palatalized consonants are [+sharp]. Its opposite term is plain,
which lacks these features, and thus corresponds to the whole range of non-
palatalized sounds. The feature is not used in the Chomsky and Halle system
(see Chomskyan).

shortest move
A principle of the minimalist programme which requires a
constituent to move from its source to the nearest available position in a
derivation. It is one of the speciﬁc economy principles recognized by that
programme. The principle is extended to include cases where one needs
to decide which constituent can move where more than one is available. For
example, in multiple WH-questions (e.g. You can give what to whom?), either
wh-phrase is a possible candidate for movement to initial sentence position; but
the one that moves is what, which is closer to sentence-initial position than
whom is. In earlier versions of the minimalist programme, this principle was
called the minimal link condition or attract closest. See movement (1).
shwa (n.)
see schwa
sibilant (adj./n.)
A term in the phonetic classiﬁcation of sounds on the basis of
manner of articulation. It refers to a fricative sound made by producing
sibilant
435

a narrow, groove-like stricture between the blade of the tongue and the
back part of the alveolar ridge. These sounds, such as [s] and [à], have a high-
frequency hiss characteristic (sibilance). Sounds which lack this feature could be
called non-sibilant. See also stridency.
sight translation
see translatology
sign (n.) (1)
Several restricted applications of this general term are found in
philosophical and linguistic studies of meaning, the former especially discuss-
ing the types of possible contrast involved in such notions as ‘signs’, ‘symbols’,
‘symptoms’ and ‘signals’. Sometimes ‘sign’ is used in an all-inclusive sense, as
when semiotics is deﬁned as ‘the science of signs’ (or signiﬁcs). In linguistic
discussion, the most widespread sense is when linguistic expressions (words,
sentences, etc.) are said to be ‘signs’ of the entities, states of affairs, etc., which
they stand for (or, often, of the concepts involved). This relationship between
sign and thing, or sign and concept, is traditionally known as signiﬁcation. The
term linguistic sign is often used when a distinction is needed with other categories
of sign (e.g. visual, tactile). Ferdinand de Saussure (see Saussurean) introduced
a French terminological distinction which has exercised a major inﬂuence on
subsequent linguistic discussion: signiﬁant (or signiﬁer, or signiﬁcans) was con-
trasted with signiﬁé (or ‘concept signiﬁed’, signiﬁcatum), and the arbitrariness
of the relationship between the form and meaning of signs was emphasized.
(2)
In such phrases as sign language and sign system, the term has a very restricted
sense, referring to the system of manual communication used by certain groups
as an alternative to oral communication. Such groups include policemen (in
trafﬁc control), drivers, monks vowed to silence, television studio directors, and
so on; but the main application of the term is in relation to the deaf, where the
linguistic properties of the various natural and contrived deaf sign languages (e.g.
American Sign Language, British Sign Language, Paget–Gorman Sign System)
began to receive systematic investigation by linguists in the 1970s (see cherology).

see sign (1)
signiﬁcant (adj.)
In linguistics, a term referring to the linguistic status of a
spoken or written feature: a feature is signiﬁcant if it is contrastive, i.e.
where by substituting it for another feature a difference in meaning is obtained.
For example, the distinction between voiced and voiceless is signiﬁcant for many
English consonants; word-order is signiﬁcant in many types of sentence.

simple (adj.)
A term sometimes used in grammatical classiﬁcation, especially
of verb forms, referring to the unmarked member of an opposition, e.g.
436
sight translation

‘simple present’ = the non-progressive aspect of the present-tense form (as
in I go); ‘simple tense’ = a verb without any auxiliaries (as in I take/took);
‘simple past’ = the past-tense form of the verb without auxiliary modiﬁcation
(as in I took). The term tends to be avoided in contemporary linguistics,
because of its undesirable psychological associations, but the oppositions between
simple and complex/compound sentences (viz. whether containing one clause
or more than one), and simple and compound/complex predicates (viz. a
predicate consisting wholly of a verb) are often used. See complex for examples
in other domains.
simple transition network
see automaton
simplicity (n.)
A measure proposed by generative linguistic theory which
would automatically assign factors to competing linguistic analyses that would
determine which of them was the most satisfactory; also called a simplicity
metric. Simplicity is here deﬁned quantitatively, in terms of the number of
constructs (symbols, rules, etc.) used in formulating an analysis; this is
also often referred to as an economy measure. Perhaps the most widespread
criterion is the number of features required in order to state a phonological
generalization, and much thought has been given by generative phonologists
to ways in which such generalizations can be more economically stated, using
various kinds of notational abbreviation, e.g. alpha notation. But the measure
relies on a notion of simplicity which still requires much theoretical and
methodological elucidation. It is proving extremely difﬁcult to evaluate simul-
taneously the many variables entering into an analysis, especially the closer that
analysis gets to the language as a whole. A simpliﬁcation made in one part of
the analysis may lead to unexpected consequences, in terms of great complexity
(or cost) elsewhere. There is also the regular possibility that adult native-
speakers, and children learning a language, will not always prefer the simpler
of the two solutions; and little progress has been made in relating simplicity to
other aspects of intuitive evaluation, such as naturalness. Simplicity, then, and
its formalization, remain a controversial topic.

single-bar (adj./n.)

theory referring to a small phrasal category, distinguished from a full phrasal
(double-bar) category and a head (zero-bar) category.
single-bar juncture
see juncture (1)
single-base (adj.)
A type of transformational rule recognized in early
models of transformational grammar, where the rule operates with an input
of one terminal string. Single-base transformations are also known as
single-base
437

singulary transformations, and are opposed to double-base types, where
more than one string is involved.

singulary (adj.)
A type of transformational rule recognized in early models
of transformational grammar, where the rule operates with an input of one
terminal string. Singulary, or single-base, transformations are contrasted
with generalized types, where more than one string is involved.
sister (adj./n.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to a relation
between nodes in a phrase-marker. A set of nodes will be called sisters if they
are all immediately dominated by the same (mother) node. Two nodes are
sisters if they c-command each other.
sister-adjunction (n.)
A type of syntactic operation in classical transforma-
tional grammar, referring to a rule which places certain elements of struc-
ture in adjacent positions, with the aim of specifying how these structures ﬁt
together in larger units. To sister-adjoin elements, a constituent A is joined to
B immediately under a mother node. A contrast was drawn with Chomsky-
adjunction, where A is joined to B by creating a new B node, which immedi-
ately dominates both A and B. In government-binding theory, the only type
of adjunction is Chomsky-adjunction.
sister-dependency (n.)
see daughter-dependency grammar
sister language
see family
situation (n.)
In linguistics, this term is generally used to refer to the
extralinguistic setting in which an utterance takes place – referring to such
notions as number of participants, level of formality, nature of the ongoing
activities, and so on. Linguistics emphasizes the need to study language in its
situation (or context, situational context or context of situation), for a full
statement of meaning to be obtained. sociolinguistics is primarily concerned
to correlate systematic variations in language with variations in social situation;
and the term ‘situation’ may be used in a restricted sense to refer to the socially
distinctive characteristics of the setting in which language is used. The situational
meaning of an utterance, in this sense, would be equivalent to its sociolinguistic
interpretation, e.g. religious, political, informal ‘situations’.
situation semantics
An approach to the semantic analysis of languages
developed during the 1980s as an alternative to possible-worlds-based model-
theoretic semantics. It assumes a richer ontology than model-theoretic
semantics, in that it treats properties, relations, etc. as primitive objects, rather than
modelling them formally in terms of possible worlds. Sentences are analysed
438
single-feature assimilation

as denoting not truth values but situations (sets of facts which consist of a
location, a relation and a truth value). The approach has also placed heavy
emphasis on the ways in which the interpretation of sentences depends on
the context.
skeletal tier
A term used in autosegmental phonology for the tier where
units are represented as consonants and vowels within syllabic structure;
also known as the CV-tier or skeleton. The intention is to represent information
about the length and arrangement of segments independently of their articul-
atory characteristics. In the original formalization, this tier is speciﬁed for
the feature [±syllabic], where vowels (V) are [+syllabic] and other units (C) are
[−syllabic]; segments may also be unspeciﬁed (symbolized as X). If these dis-
tinctions are interpreted structurally, corresponding to location within the syllable,
the C-position is the onset (where only non-syllabic material can be found), the
V-position is the nucleus (where only syllabic material can be found), and the
X-position is the coda (where either is possible). There are analogous notions
in other models of non-linear phonology, e.g. the syllabic representation
which forms part of the prosodic hierarchy in prosodic morphology. See also
X-tier.
skeleton (n.)
see skeletal tier
Skolem function
A term used in semantics for a function which maps indi-
viduals onto individuals; named after Norwegian logician (Albert) Thoralf Skolem
(1887–1963). Skolem functions play an important role in certain semantic analyses
of anaphora, especially in interrogative sentences.
slash (n.)
A term used in generalized phrase-structure grammar for a
feature (symbolized using a ‘slash’ notation as in ‘S/NP’) which is used in the
analysis of unbounded dependency constructions to indicate what category
is missing.
slip of the tongue
see tongue-slip
slit (adj.)
A term used by some phoneticians to refer to a type of fricative
where air is released over the surface of the articulators through a narrow,
horizontal opening; also called ﬂat. Such fricatives (e.g. [f], [θ], [ç]) are con-
trasted with groove fricatives, where a hollowing of the active articulator is
involved (e.g. [s], [à]).
sloppy identity
In grammar and semantics, a type of relationship between the
deleted element in an elliptical construction and its antecedent, where the
reference of the elements is not exactly the same. For example in Mary likes
her sister and so does Jane, a possible interpretation would be that ‘Jane likes
her own sister’. If the referent of the deleted element is exactly the same as the
antecedent (i.e. in this example, ‘Jane also likes Mary’s sister’), there is said to
be strict identity.
slot (n.) (1)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to a place in a
construction into which a class of items can be inserted. For example, in
slot
439

the sentence The children – home, the ‘slot’ marked by the dash can be ‘ﬁlled’
by came, are, went, etc. – a subclass of verbs. Approaches characterized by this
emphasis are sometimes referred to as slot-and-ﬁller models. The analysis of
sentence structure in terms of slots is a major feature of tagmemic gram-
mar, where the notion is used to identify the ﬁller items (e.g. ‘subject slot’,
‘object slot’).
(2)
A term used in autosegmental phonology for an element on the ske-
letal tier. These elements are also known as V-slots and C-slots, referring to
the segments to which vowels and consonants must associate if they are to be
realized (see association line).
sluicing (n.)
A term sometimes used in syntax for a type of ellipsis, in which
an interrogative item is interpreted as a complete question, the omitted material
being retrieved from the previous discourse. The deletion leaves a WH-phrase,
as in Somebody just left. Guess who. Cases where the existential quantiﬁer
some is the antecedent are called sprouting, as in He ate. I don’t know what.
small clause (SC)
A term used in government-binding theory for a clause
that contains neither a ﬁnite verb nor an inﬁnitival to. Lacking both C
and I, its structure can be deﬁned as [NP XP], where XP is an AP, NP, etc.
Examples include John considered [Mary foolish], Mary considered [ John a
fool], I want [him off my boat] and I saw [him do it].

social stratiﬁcation

sociohistorical linguistics
A approach within sociolinguistics which studies
the forms and uses of language in society, and how particular linguistic
functions and types of variation develop over time within speciﬁc languages,
speech communities, social groups and individuals.
sociolect (n.)
A term used by some sociolinguists to refer to a linguistic vari-
ety (or lect) deﬁned on social (as opposed to regional) grounds, e.g. correlating
with a particular social class or occupational group.
sociolinguistics (n.)
A branch of linguistics which studies all aspects of the
relationship between language and society. Sociolinguists study such matters
440
sluicing

as the linguistic identity of social groups, social attitudes to language, stand-
ard and non-standard forms of language, the patterns and needs of national
language use, social varieties and levels of language, the social basis of
multilingualism, and so on. An alternative name sometimes given to the
subject (which suggests a greater concern with sociological rather than linguistic
explanations of the above) is the sociology of language. Any of the branches of
linguistics could, in principle, be separately studied within an explicitly social
perspective, and some use is accordingly made of such terms as sociophonetics
and sociophonology, when this emphasis is present, as in the study of the
properties of accents. In Hallidayan linguistics, the term sociosemantics has a
somewhat broader sense, in which the choices available within a grammar are
related to communication roles found within the speech situation, as when a
particular type of question is perceived in social terms to be a threat.
The term overlaps to some degree with ethnolinguistics and anthropolo-
gical linguistics, reﬂecting the overlapping interests of the correlative dis-
ciplines involved – sociology, ethnology and anthropology. The study of dialects
is sometimes seen as a branch of sociolinguistics, and sometimes differentiated
from it, under the heading of dialectology, especially when regional dialects
are the focus of study. When the emphasis is on the language of face-to-face
interaction, the approach is known as interactional sociolinguistics (see inter-
action). Sociological linguistics is sometimes differentiated from sociolinguis-
tics, particularly in Europe, where the term reﬂects a concern to see language
as an integral part of sociological theory. Also sometimes distinguished is
sociohistorical linguistics, the study of the way particular linguistic functions
and types of variation develop over time within speciﬁc languages, speech com-
munities, social groups and individuals.

sociopragmatics (n.)
A term sometimes used within the study of pragmatics, to
refer to the way conditions on language use derive from the social situation.
It contrasts with a view of pragmatics in which language use is studied from
the viewpoint of the structural resources available in a language (sometimes
referred to as pragmalinguistics).
soft consonant
An impressionistic term sometimes used in the phonetic
descriptions of particular languages, referring to a consonant which is pala-
talized; also called a soft sign. Russian is a language which has several such
soft (as opposed to hard) consonants. In Russian the [ symbol (‘soft sign’)
typically marks the palatalization (or ‘softening’) of the preceding consonant.

The commercial name of the most widely used model of
sound spectrograph, its visual displays being referred to as sonagrams (cf.

sonorant (adj./n.) (son)
One of the major class features of sound set up
by Chomsky and Halle (see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory
of phonology, to handle variations in manner of articulation. Sonorant
sounds are deﬁned articulatorily, as those produced with a relatively free air-
ﬂow, and a vocal fold position such that spontaneous voicing is possible,
as in vowels, liquids, nasals and laterals. Its opposite is non-sonorant
(or obstruent), referring to sounds where there is a stricture impeding the
airﬂow, as in plosives, fricatives and affricates. An analogous term is
resonant.
sonority (n.) (1)
A term in auditory phonetics for the overall loudness of
a sound relative to others of the same pitch, stress and duration. Sounds
are said to have an ‘inherent sonority’, which accounts for the impression of
a sound’s ‘carrying further’, e.g. [s] carries further than [à], [a] further than
[i]. Sonority is typically calculated along a scale from voiceless stops (least)
to low vowels (most): voiceless stops – voiced stops – voiceless fricatives –
voiced fricatives – nasals – liquids – glides – high vowels – mid vowels – low
vowels. lenition processes increase a segments’s sonority and fortition pro-
cesses decrease it.
(2)
In phonology, a term used in attempts to deﬁne the syllabic structure
of utterances. For example, the notion is important in autosegmental (and
speciﬁcally metrical) phonology. In a sonority scale, or sonority hierarchy,
the most sonorous elements are assigned the highest value, and the least sonor-
ous the lowest value. The centre of a syllable (the syllabic nucleus) is deﬁned
as the place where sonority is greatest (the sonority peak). Patterns of sonority
sequence have been noted, leading to such observations as the sonority sequencing
generalization: in any syllable, there is a segment constituting a sonority peak
which is preceded and/or followed by a sequence of segments with progressively
decreasing sonority values. In optimality theory, the term refers to a con-
straint which requires that syllable onsets increase in sonority and codas
decrease in sonority.
(3)
The notion of visual sonority is used in the phonological analysis of the
various features of sign language.
sortal (adj.)
A property of a word that necessarily applies to an entity through-
out its existence; for example, cow is sortal, whereas ill is non-sortal. The term
(and the associated noun sortality) derives from ‘sort’, in the sense of ‘species’.
Sortal terms include natural kind terms (cow), artefactual terms (car), and
abstract terms (number). Multi-word items are not excluded (black-and-white
cow).
sound change/law/shift
Terms used in historical linguistics to describe
the changes in a language’s sound system over a period of time. Many
types of sound change have been recognized, e.g. whether the change affects
the total number of phonemes (as when two phonemes merge into one, or
one phoneme splits into two) or affects only the allophones of a phoneme.
Particular attention is paid to the nature of the environments which can be
shown to restrict (or ‘condition’) the sound change. When a series of related
sound changes takes place at a particular stage of a language’s history, the
442
sonorant

change is known as a sound shift, e.g. a vowel shift (as took place between
Middle and Early Modern English – the Great Vowel Shift) or a consonant
shift (as in several of the correspondences between Latin and English). A regular
series of changes is traditionally referred to in comparative philology as a
sound law – one hypothesis about such ‘laws’ (the neogrammarian hypothesis)
being that they had no exceptions, i.e. at a given time all words containing a
sound in a given phonetic environment would change in the same way, and
any which did not could be explained by reference to a further law. Several
apparent exceptions to the initial statement of such laws came to be explained
by investigations which were carried out working on this premise. See also
diffusion, wave (1).
sound spectrograph
see spectrograph
sound-symbolism (n.)
A term used in semiotics and linguistics to refer to
a direct association between the form and the meaning of language: the
sounds used reﬂect properties of the external world, as in cases of onomatopoeia
(e.g. cuckoo, murmur, crash) and other forms of synaesthesia (e.g. sl- in such
words as slimy, slither). Sound-symbolic words are also sometimes referred to
as mimetic.
sound system
A term for the network, or system, of phonetically realized
contrasts which constitute the phonology of a language, dialect, etc.
source (adj./n.) (1)
A term used in the phrase source feature to refer to one of
the ﬁve main dimensions of classiﬁcation in Chomsky and Halle’s distinctive
feature theory of phonology (the others being major class features, cavity
features, manner-of-articulation features, and prosodic features). The term
subsumes the feature oppositions of heightened subglottal pressure, voice
and strident. See Chomskyan.
(2)
In acoustic phonetics, source refers to the waveform of the vibrating
larynx. Its spectrum is rich in harmonics, which gradually decrease in
amplitude as their frequency increases. The various resonance chambers of
the vocal tract, especially the movements of the tongue and lips, then act on
the laryngeal source in the manner of a ﬁlter (see ﬁltered speech), reinforcing
certain harmonics relative to others. The combination of these two elements is
known as the source-ﬁlter model of vowel production.
(3)
In the study of communication, source refers to a point of origin of a
message, as opposed to its ‘destination’. More speciﬁcally, in semantics, the
term is used as part of a localistic theory of meaning: an entity takes a ‘path’
from a ‘source’ to a ‘goal’. In case grammar, it refers to the place from which
something moves. See semantic role.
(4)
In historical linguistics, the term is used to characterize a language
from which a particular feature (such as a loan word) comes (the ‘source
language’); the receiving language is known as the ‘matrix’ language. Alternative
terminology is ‘donor’ and ‘recipient’ language.
(5)
In translating and interpreting, the term describes the language from which
a message originates (the ‘source language’); the ‘target’ language is the one into
which the translation takes place.

In the linguistic study of conceptual metaphor, a metaphor is seen as a
mapping between a better-known, more concrete conceptual domain (the ‘source
domain’) and the conceptual domain which it helps to organize (the ‘target
domain’).

speaker identiﬁcation/recognition/veriﬁcation
In phonetics and computa-
tional linguistics, speaker recognition is the acoustic analysis of a speech
sample to infer the identity of the speaker (see acoustic phonetics); also called
voice recognition. In speaker veriﬁcation, a sample of speech is acoustically
analysed to check a claimed identity against a stored reference sample stored in
the computer. This technique is used, for example, in such situations as control-
ling access to buildings. In speaker identiﬁcation, a speech sample from a known
speaker is compared to one obtained from an unknown speaker, to determine
whether the same person is involved. This technique has been most commonly
used in criminal cases, where the analysis of spectrograms (as in voiceprinting)
has been used to investigate whether the speaker in a tape-recording is the same
as a suspect. See also speech recognition.
specialization (n.)
A suggested deﬁning property of semiotic systems, such
as human language, referring to the extent to which the use of a signal and
the behaviour it evokes are directly linked. Animal communication is said to
lack specialization, in that a signal triggers a behaviour; language, by contrast, is
highly specialized, as the behavioural consequences of using a linguistic signal
are less predictable (and often unpredictable).
speciﬁcation (n.)
see underspeciﬁcation
speciﬁc deﬁnite
see speciﬁc indeﬁnite
speciﬁc indeﬁnite
A term used in semantics for indeﬁnite noun phrases
which identify an individual more precisely than other indeﬁnites. The exact
meaning of the term varies widely among authors. In one interpretation, in the
sentence Jane is married to a pilot, a pilot would be an example of speciﬁc
indeﬁniteness, in that it is understood to mean a known, particular pilot whose
identity is not being disclosed. The contrast would be with Jane wants to marry
a pilot, which is totally non-deﬁnite. Both are distinct from speciﬁc deﬁnite noun
phrases, as seen in Jane is going to marry the pilot that lives in the apartment
upstairs.
speciﬁed-subject condition
A term used in extended standard theory to
refer to a type of constraint on the application of transformational or
interpretive rules; replaced in government-binding theory by conditions
A and B of binding theory. The constraint states that when a subordinate
444
space grammar

clause or noun phrase contains a speciﬁed subject (a lexical, NP, pronom-
inal or trace, but not pro), no other (non-subject) constituent can be moved
out of that clause. An example violating this constraint is *Who did you buy
Mary’s picture of?
speciﬁer (n.) (spec, Spec)
A relation in the X-bar theory of phrase structure.
Speciﬁers are normally seen as combining with a single-bar category to form
the related double-bar category. For example, in John is a student, a is the
speciﬁer of the noun, student, and in She is very happy, she is the speciﬁer of
the adjective, happy. Spec/head agreement is agreement between the head of a
phrase and the element which occupies the speciﬁer of that phrase.
spectrograph (n.)
An instrument used in acoustic phonetics which provides
a visual representation of the acoustic features that constitute the sounds in an
utterance. The original sound spectrograph produced a three-dimensional visual
record, or spectrogram, of an utterance, in which time is displayed horizontally,
frequency vertically, and intensity by the relative blackness of the marks, on a
sheet of sensitized paper. Today, spectrographic information can be generated
electronically and displayed on a screen.
spectrum (n.)
A term derived from the study of the physics of sound, and used
in acoustic phonetics, referring to the set of acoustic components which
identify a complex sound wave. A spectral analysis is a graph in which one axis
displays the frequency of each harmonic and the other displays amplitude.
Several devices are available to measure and display spectra, but the one most
commonly used in phonetics is the spectrograph.
speech (n.)
For the most part, the term is used in linguistics in its everyday
sense, providing the subject with its primary data. There are two main inter-
pretations of these data, which are complementary rather than opposed. One
interpretation is from the viewpoint of phonetics: here, speech is seen as a
medium of transmission for language – the spoken medium or phonic sub-
stance of language (as opposed to writing). It is in this context that the term
is used as part of the label for the many devices available in instrumental
phonetics, e.g. the speech stretcher (which presents a slowed but otherwise
undistorted recording of speech). Speech science is the study of all the factors
involved in the production, transmission and reception of speech; also called
speech sciences or speech and hearing science. As well as phonetics, the study
includes such subjects as anatomy, physiology, neurology and acoustics, as
applied to speech.
The other interpretation is from the viewpoint of linguistics, where spoken
language (performance, or parole) can be analysed in phonological,
grammatical and semantic, as well as phonetic terms. It is in this sense
that terms such as speech community are used, referring to any regionally or
socially deﬁnable human group identiﬁed by a shared linguistic system. The
term speech act, also, has a more abstract sense than its name suggests (see
separate entry); it is not in fact an ‘act of speaking’, but the activity which the
use of language performs or promotes in the listener (respectively, the
speech
445

illocutionary force and the perlocutionary effect of the language). Simi-
larly, the speech event is seen as the basic unit for the analysis of spoken
interaction, i.e. the emphasis is on the role of the participants in constructing a
discourse of verbal exchanges.
Phonetics and psycholinguistics have come to pay increasing attention to
constructing models of the neurophysiological mechanisms hypothesized to
underlie speech behaviour. In this respect, two main branches of speech analysis
have developed: speech production, involving the planning and execution of acts
of speaking; and speech perception, involving the perception and interpretation
of the sound sequences of speech. The term speech recognition (or speech recep-
tion) is used to identify the initial stage of the decoding process involved in
speech perception – and also the automatic decoding of speech by machine.
Speaker recognition is the analysis of speech to infer the identity of the speaker
or to check a claimed identity (speaker veriﬁcation). The whole activity of the
perception and production of speech is known as speech processing. See also
direct (2), displaced, language, speaker recognition, speech recogni-
tion, speech synthesis.
speech act
A term derived from the work of the philosopher J. L. Austin (1911–
60), and now used widely in linguistics, to refer to a theory which analyses
the role of utterances in relation to the behaviour of speaker and hearer in
interpersonal communication. It is not an ‘act of speech’ (in the sense of
parole), but a communicative activity (a locutionary act), deﬁned with
reference to the intentions of speakers while speaking (the illocutionary force
of their utterances) and the effects they achieve on listeners (the perlocutionary
effect of their utterances). Several categories of speech act have been proposed,
viz. directives (speakers try to get their listeners to do something, e.g. begging,
commanding, requesting), commissives (speakers commit themselves to a future
course of action, e.g. promising, guaranteeing), expressives (speakers express
their feelings, e.g. apologizing, welcoming, sympathizing), declarations (the
speaker’s utterance brings about a new external situation, e.g. christening,
marrying, resigning) and representatives (speakers convey their belief about
the truth of a proposition, e.g. asserting, hypothesizing). The verbs which are
used to indicate the speech act intended by the speaker are sometimes known as
performative verbs. The criteria which have to be satisﬁed in order for a
speech act to be successful are known as felicity conditions.

speech community
In linguistics, a term which describes any regionally or
socially deﬁnable human group which can be identiﬁed by the use of a shared
spoken language or language variety. It can vary in size from a tiny cluster
of speakers to whole nations or supranational groups (such as the Russian-using
speech community in Asia).
speech event
In sociolinguistics and the study of discourse, a term describ-
ing a communicative exchange made meaningful by culturally speciﬁc structures
446
speech act

of participants, genres, codes and other elements. Usage in a language is organ-
ized through the higher-level patterning of speech events. Examples of highly
structured speech events are debates and interviews. Much less structured are
conversations.
speech perception
In phonetics and psycholinguistics, a term for the pro-
cess whereby a listener extracts a sequence of discrete phonetic and linguistic
units from the continuous acoustic signal of speech. The term also applies to
the study of the neuropsychological mechanisms governing this ability.
speech processing
see speech
speech production
In phonetics and psycholinguistics, a term for the activity
of the respiratory, phonatory and articulatory systems during speech, along
with the associated neural programming required for their co-ordination and
use. A contrast is usually drawn with the receptive aspects of spoken commun-
ication, such as speech perception and recognition. See chain (1).
speech recognition
In phonetics and computational linguistics, the recog-
nition of human speech through computer analysis; also called automatic speech
recognition (ASR). The term should not be confused with speaker recogni-
tion, where the aim is to identify the person speaking rather than what is being
said. The task involves the matching of an input acoustic signal with a vocabu-
lary (of sounds, syllables, words, etc.) stored in the computer’s memory. A
standard technique for matching individual words is to use stored waveforms
(or features/parameters of waveforms) against which an input signal is matched
(‘template matching’). The computer requires a period of training, in which it
receives examples of spoken words provided by (single or multiple) speakers,
and averages these to derive a canonical waveform. The variable rate of
speech inputs needs to be taken into account, most often using the technique of
‘dynamic time warping’, in which segments in the input signal are aligned with
those in the template. The more challenging aim of ASR is to handle continuous
speech. Here the computer is provided with information about typical patterns
of phonetic and phonological segmentation, as well as morphological and
syntactic information. More advanced simulations, such as those provided by
connectionist models, are also used.
speech science(s)
see speech
speech stretcher
In instrumental phonetics, a device which presents a slowed
but undistorted recording of speech. It is helpful in identifying sounds which
might otherwise be lost in the speed of normal speech, in studying the transi-
tions betwen adjacent sounds, and in monitoring such features as intonation.
speech surrogate
In linguistics and semiotics, a communication system
which replaces the use of speech. Examples include drum languages and
whistle-speech.
speech synthesis
In phonetics and computational linguistics, the process of
generating artiﬁcial speech signals, using a model of the linguistically important
speech synthesis
447

acoustic or articulatory properties. The devices involved are known as speech
synthesizers. Acoustic domain analogs or terminal analogs replicate the acoustic
properties of the vocal tract in terms of its output. The tract is represented
using a source-ﬁlter model, and several devices have been devised to synthesize
speech in this way, such as the early channel vocoders, the spectrogram-based
formant synthesizers, and linear prediction coefﬁcient (LPC) synthesizers.
Articulatory analogs replicate the anatomical geometry of the vocal tract between
the larynx and the lips, in so far as information about the dynamic properties
of the phonatory and articulatory parameters is available. A further technique is
called text-to-speech synthesis, in which written texts are automatically trans-
formed into their spoken equivalents (see text-to-speech).
speech time

speed (n.)
see rate
spell-out (n.)
In the minimalist programme, an operation which distinguishes
the phonetic representation within a structural description from other
kinds of information. The operation motivates the distinction between phonetic
form (PF) and logical form (LF). Semantic information is not allowed in PF
representations, and phonological information is not allowed in LF representa-
tions. Movements which occur before spell-out will affect the pronunciation of
a sentence; those which occur afterwards will not. Since spell-out is an operation,
it is different from S-structure, a structural representation, in government-
binding theory. In later minimalist thinking, spell-out is called transfer.
spike (n.)
In acoustic phonetics, a burst of acoustic energy with an abrupt
onset and very short duration. It is typically seen in a spectrogram at the point
where a plosive consonant closure is released.

spreading (n.) (1)
A term in the classiﬁcation of lip position in phonetics,
referring to the visual appearance of the lips when they are held fairly close
together and stretched sideways, as in a slightly open smile. Spread lips are
noticeable in close vowels, as in the [i] of see, and contrast with neutral,
open and rounded lip positions. A similar use of the term is found in relation
to glottal aperture, which may be described as varying between spread (wide)
and constricted (narrow). Sounds which are [+spread glottis] are produced
with audible glottal friction, as in English aspirated stops.
(2)
In some models of non-linear phonology, spreading refers to the asso-
ciation (or linking) of a feature or node belonging to one segment with an
adjacent segment; the disassociation of a feature or node from a segment is
called delinking. The notion is of particular importance in the study of assimila-
tion, where the effect of spreading produces an output representation with
multilinked nodes, and dissimilation, where a feature or node is delinked from
a segment, and the orphaned node is later deleted. autosegmental spreading
also accounts for compensatory lengthening in a cv framework.
(3)
In autosegmental phonology, spreading refers to a type of rule which
extends the association of a tone in a given direction, e.g. a high tone asso-
ciated with an initial vowel comes to be associated with the following vowel(s)
(see association line). Spreading is indicated by an arrow in the autosegmental
rule, pointing to the right for unbounded rightward spreading, and to the left
for unbounded leftward spreading:
S-structure

sprouting

squish (n.)
A term introduced into linguistic analysis by the American linguist
John Robert Ross (b. 1938) in the early 1970s, as part of his notion of non-
discrete grammar; it refers to a continuum along which lexical items can
be placed (see gradience). For example, on the gradient between the ‘poles’
of verb and noun, lexical items are seen as displaying degrees of verb-ness or
noun-ness, and syntactic rules are seen as applying with varying productiv-
ity to different parts of the continuum. For example, nouns used as premodiﬁers
in noun phrases fall between the classes of noun and adjective (e.g. the
railway station, the town clock), in that some but not all rules which apply to
nouns can be used (cf. the town’s clock, *the towns clock, etc.). indeterminate
or fuzzy categories are the focus of attention. What remains unclear, in this
approach, is the extent to which these cases are sufﬁciently different from other
problems of classiﬁcation to warrant a radical reformulation of linguistic theory.
s-selection
see selectional feature
S-structure (n.)
A term used in government-binding theory to refer to an
alternative conception of surface or shallow structure, which has been
V
T
V
T

enriched by the inclusion of empty elements (such as traces and pro) relating
to a sentence’s deep structure (or D-structure). S-structure is what is pro-
duced after transformations and case rules, but before deletion rules and
ﬁlters; it is the input to the rules of semantic interpretation. It contrasts with
surface structure, which follows deletion and ﬁltering, and which is the input to
the phonological component.
stability (n.)
A term used in autosegmental phonology for an effect which
stems from the principle of autonomy of tiers in the phonological representa-
tion: operations which apply to a segment on one tier (e.g. deletion) will not
affect any autosegment with which that segment was formerly associated. For
example, a tone can be deleted without its corresponding vowel being deleted,
and vice versa.
stage (n.)
In semantic theory, a temporal part of an individual. The individual
is seen as existing over a limited span of time, not typically including its entire
lifetime. Stage-level predicates represent typically short-lived properties or actions,
and produce existential readings when they combine with bare plural noun
phrases. For example, the sentence Snow-ﬂakes are melting on the ground
contains a stage-level predicate; it contrasts with such sentences as Snow-ﬂakes
are cold (an individual-level predicate).
standard (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to a prestige variety
of language used within a speech community. ‘Standard languages/dialects/
varieties’ cut across regional differences, providing a uniﬁed means of commun-
ication, and thus an institutionalized norm which can be used in the mass-
media, in teaching the language to foreigners, and so on. Linguistic forms or
dialects which do not conform to this norm are then referred to as substandard
or (with a less pejorative preﬁx) non-standard – though neither term is intended
to suggest that other dialect forms ‘lack standards’ in any linguistic sense. The
natural development of a standard language in a speech community (or an
attempt by a community to impose one dialect as a standard) is known as
standardization.
standard English
In sociolinguistics, a much debated term for the variety
of English used as a communicative norm throughout the English-speaking world.
The notion has become increasingly difﬁcult to handle because of the emergence
of differing national standards of usage (in vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation
and spelling) in areas where large numbers of people speak English as a ﬁrst
or second language: there are important regional differences between the UK,
the USA, Canada, Australia, South Africa, the West Indies, India, West Africa
and several other parts of the English-speaking world.
standard theory/model
A term used in generative linguistics to refer to the
model of generative grammar proposed by Noam Chomsky in his 1965 book,
Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (see Chomskyan). The importance of this
formulation is such that, despite extensive subsequent modiﬁcations and altern-
atives provided by Chomsky and others, it is still viewed by many as the main
statement concerning the aims and form of a transformational grammar.
450
stability

It is usually contrasted with the extended standard theory developed by
Chomsky in later modiﬁcations of his own work, the revised extended stand-
ard theory, government-binding theory, and the various ‘non-standard’
versions of generative grammar (e.g. generative semantics), which differ radic-
ally from the Aspects model.
star (n.)
see asterisk
starred form
A term used in linguistics to refer to a linguistic construc-
tion that is unacceptable or ungrammatical, and marked thus by the use
of an initial asterisk, e.g. *a boys have gone. The term asterisked form is
an alternative. In historical linguistics, starred forms indicate historical
reconstructions, the forms cited not being attested in any written records. In
autosegmental phonology, a ‘starred association’ is an association which
resists modiﬁcation by subsequent rules.
state (n.) (1)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the condition of a language
at a hypothetical point or period of time, e.g. Middle English, sixteenth century,
1920s. States of languages (see état de langue) thus constitute the subject-
matter of synchronic linguistics.
(2)
See stative.
(3)
See automaton, network grammar.
state (adj.)
A category used in the classiﬁcation of predicates in terms of their
aspectual properties (or Aktionsarten) devised by US philosopher Zeno Vendler
(1921–2004). State predicates represent events which last for a period of time
without evident change, such as know. In this system they contrast with three
types of process predicate: accomplishment, achievement and activity.
statement (n.)
A term used in the classiﬁcation of sentence function, and
deﬁned sometimes on grammatical and sometimes on semantic or sociolin-
guistic grounds. syntactically, a statement is in English typically a sentence
which contains a subject occurring before a verb, e.g. The train is coming.
Semantically, it is used primarily to convey information. The term is usually
contrasted with three other major sentence functions: question, command,
exclamation. In grammatical discussion, statements are usually referred to as
declarative or indicative in form.
state-transition semantics

static (adj.) (1)
A term sometimes used in phonology, applied to tones
which do not vary in pitch range; also called level tones. A contrast is usually
drawn with dynamic tones. See also register tone language.

statistical linguistics
A branch of linguistics which studies the application of
statistical techniques in linguistic theory and description. The study includes
the analysis of frequency and distribution of linguistic units in texts with
statistical linguistics
451

the aim of identifying the distinctive characteristics of the speaker or writer
(as in stylostatistics); but attempts have also been made to establish general laws
concerning the statistical characteristics of languages, such as the relationship
between word types (e.g. the word up) and word tokens (e.g. the number of
instances of the word up in a sample), the relative frequency of items in different
samples, the quantiﬁcation of such notions as redundancy in statistical terms,
and so on. See also quantitative linguistics.
statistical universal
see universal
stative (adj./n.) (stat, STAT)
A term used in grammatical classiﬁcation referring
to one of two main aspectual categories of verb use, the other being dynamic.
The distinguishing criteria for stativity are mainly syntactic; for example, stative,
static or state verbs do not usually occur in a progressive form (e.g. *I am
knowing, *He is concerning), nor in the imperative (e.g. *know!). On semantic
grounds, they can be said to express states of affairs, rather than actions, i.e.
the expression of relational processes (e.g. be, belong to, involve, seem) or of
inactive perceptual or cognitive processes (e.g. know, mean, realize, suppose).
The classiﬁcation is complicated by the existence of verbs which have both a
stative and a dynamic use, e.g. smell.
status planning
see language planning
stem (n.)
A term often used in linguistics as part of a classiﬁcation of the
kinds of elements operating within the structure of a word. The stem may
consist solely of a single root morpheme (i.e. a ‘simple’ stem, as in man), or of
two root morphemes (e.g. a ‘compound’ stem, as in blackbird), or of a root
morpheme plus a derivational afﬁx (i.e. a ‘complex’ stem, as in manly,
unmanly, manliness). All have in common the notion that it is to the stem that
inﬂectional afﬁxes are attached.
stereotype (n.) (1)
A term used by some grammarians for a sequence of
words which resembles a productive grammatical structure but which in
fact has been learned as a single unit and has little or no productivity. Proverbs,
quotations, aphorisms and several types of idiom can be classed as grammatical
stereotypes: the sentence Jack and Jill went up the hill, for example, might be
used by a young child who is not yet at the stage of producing co-ordinations
or past tenses in spontaneous speech. Stereotyped constructions are particularly
common in the speech of those suffering from language handicap.
(2)
In semantics, especially in theories of direct reference, a term used for a
set of properties regarded by a community of speakers as characterizing typical
members of a category. The term is intended to allow for inaccurate beliefs on
the part of the speaker community, so that actual members of the category may
not typically conform to the stereotype at all; none the less, knowledge of the
stereotype is required for semantic competence in the language.
(3)
In sociolinguistics, a term referring to a linguistic variable which is a
widely recognized characterization of the speech of a particular group, which
may or may not reﬂect accurately the speech of those it is supposed to represent.
Examples include the imagined universality of chap in England, look you in
452
statistical universal

Wales and begorrah in Ireland. Some stereotypical features, such as ain’t, may
become stigmatized as substandard or incorrect within the speech community.
William Labov (b. 1927) distinguishes stereotypes from indicators and markers.
stimulus (n.)
see poverty of the stimulus
stock (n.)
see family
stop (n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds on the basis
of their manner of articulation. It refers to any sound which is produced
by a complete closure in the vocal tract, and thus traditionally includes
the class of plosives. Both nasal and oral sounds can be classiﬁed as stops,
though the term is usually reserved for the latter. A distinction is sometimes
made between ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ stops, depending on whether the closure is
made at one place or at two places simultaneously (e.g. the [f] coarticulation
heard in some African languages, or consonants produced with a simultaneous
glottal stop). Other classiﬁcations of stop consonants involve taking into
account the direction of airﬂow, whether ingressive or egressive: ‘ingressive
stops’ are often referred to as suction stops, ‘egressive stops’ as pressure stops.
In the distinctive feature theory of phonology, the term ‘stop’ is sometimes
used in opposition to continuant.
storage
see lexical storage, processing
stranding (n.)
A term used in some grammars to refer to an element which
is left unattached after it has been moved out of a construction, or after
the rest of the construction has been moved. For example, a preposition is
commonly left stranded, after the noun phrase within the prepositional phrase
has been moved, as in Who did you give the book to?; the auxiliary verb did
is stranded after the ellipsis of the second clause in He asked her to arrive
before six, but she didn’t.
stratiﬁcation (n.)
In sociolinguistics, a term which refers to the distribu-
tion of linguistic variables in relation to the various levels (strata) of society;
also called social stratiﬁcation. When there is a clear-cut difference in the
way the members of two groups (e.g. working-class and middle-class) use a
linguistic variable, the phenomenon is called sharp stratiﬁcation, a pattern often
seen with grammatical variation; when there is a step-like progression, the
effect is described as gradient stratiﬁcation, a pattern typical of phonological
variation.
stratiﬁcational grammar
A linguistic theory devised by the American linguist
Sydney M. Lamb (b. 1929), as expounded initially in Outline of Stratiﬁcational
Grammar (1962), which models language as a system of several related layers
(or strata) of structure. Six strata are recognized for English and many other
languages: the component of phonology comprises the hypophonemic (or
phonetic) and phonemic strata; grammar comprises morphemic and lexemic
strata; and semology comprises the sememic and hypersememic (or semantic)
strata. Each stratum is organized in terms of a set of stratal systems, and each
stratiﬁcational grammar
453

system deals with an aspect of linguistic structure which has to be stated inde-
pendently of the structures operating at other strata. Two types of patterning
are recognized: tactic analysis (the patterns of sequential arrangement within
each stratum) and realizational analysis (the relationship between units
operating at higher and lower levels between strata). A parallel terminology
is used for each stratum: there is a ‘hypophonemic/phonemic/morphonemic/
lexemic/sememic/hypersememic’ system consisting of various structural patterns
(e.g. ‘hypophonotactic/phonotactic’, etc.), deﬁned in terms of ‘hypophonemes/
phonemes’, etc., and realized as ‘hypophons/phons/morphons/lexons’, etc.
stray (adj.)
A term used in various models of non-linear phonology, describ-
ing a unit (e.g. a syllable, a segment) which falls outside the conventions of
a representation and which therefore needs to be handled in a special way.
For example, in metrical phonology a stray syllable produced by destressing
(see stress) needs to be adjoined to another node in the word tree (stray syllable
adjunction). Stray erasure is a procedure which deletes segments which
cannot be incorporated into a well-formed syllable. It is particularly used in
relation to consonants, where it accounts for certain types of syllable shorten-
ing and consonant deletion. For example, its application is suggested in cases
like hymn/hymnal, where /mn/ is an unacceptable coda sequence. However, an
underlying representation of /him.n/ would result in an unsyllabiﬁed /n/, which
(in one solution) could then be deleted by stray erasure.
strength (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology, referring to a universal scale
(or scales) of values on which units (segments or classes of segments) can be
arrayed, from strong to weak: the behaviour of segments in diachronic or
synchronic processes is claimed to be derivable from their rank on the scale.
In one approach, for example, velars are assigned a lower rank on this scale
(are ‘weaker’) than dentals, which are in turn weaker than labials. The
approach aims to determine mechanically, on the basis of a strength scale for
segments and for structural positions, the relative probability of any segment
occurring in any position, e.g. the hypothesis that strong segments will dominate
in strong positions, and weak segments in weak positions. However, the number
and nature of phonological scales of this kind is controversial.
(2)
In early versions of the minimalist programme, the term appears as a
class of morphosyntactic features, opposed to weak. Strong features are those
that need to be checked off as soon as they are introduced into the derivation,
triggering movement. The checking of weak features can wait until spell-out.
stress (n.)
A term used in phonetics to refer to the degree of force used in
producing a syllable. The usual distinction is between stressed and unstressed
syllables, the former being more prominent than the latter (and marked in
transcription with a raised vertical line, [c]. The prominence is usually due to
an increase in loudness of the stressed syllable, but increases in length and
often pitch may contribute to the overall impression of prominence. In popular
usage, ‘stress’ is usually equated with an undifferentiated notion of ‘emphasis’ or
‘strength’.
From the viewpoint of phonology, the main function of stress is to provide a
means of distinguishing degrees of emphasis or contrast in sentences (sentence
454
stray

stress), as in The big man looks angry; the term contrastive stress is often used
for this function. Many pairs of words and word sequences can also be distin-
guished using stress variation (lexical stress or word stress), as in the contrast
between An increase in pay is needed and I’m going to increase his pay –
/c}ºkrips/ v. /}ºckrips/ – or the distinction between cblack cbird and cblack-bird. The
analytical question here, which attracted a great deal of attention in the middle
decades of the twentieth century, is how many degrees of stress need to be recog-
nized in order to account for all such contrasts, and to show the interrelationships
between words derived from a common root, such as ctelegraph, telecgraphic and
teclegraphy. In the American structuralist tradition, four such degrees are
usually distinguished, and analysed as stress phonemes, namely (from strongest
to weakest) (1) ‘primary’, (2) ‘secondary’, (3) ‘tertiary’ and (4) ‘weak’. These
contrasts are, however, demonstrable only on words in isolation, as in the
compound elevator operator – one of several such phrases originally cited to
justify analyses of this kind.
Alternative views recognized different kinds and degrees of stress, the simplest
postulating a straight stressed v. unstressed contrast, referring to other factors
(such as intonation and vowel quality) to explain such sequences as elevator
operator. In distinctive feature theories of phonology, the various degrees of
stress are assigned to the syllables of words by means of the repeated application
of rules (such as ‘lexical’, ‘compound’ and ‘nuclear’ stress rules). Some ana-
lysts maintain there is a distinction to be made between linguistic contrasts
involving loudness (which they refer to as ‘stress’) and those additionally invol-
ving pitch (which they refer to as accent). All the examples given above,
they would argue, are matters of accent, not stress, because contrasts in pitch
variation are normally involved. Similar problems arise in the analysis of tone
languages.
In cross-language comparison, it is useful to note variations in the typical
place within the word where the stressed syllable falls. Some languages have a
ﬁxed stress (or accent), e.g. Welsh, where the stressed syllable is almost always
the penultimate, in polysyllabic words. Others, such as English, have a free or
movable stress (accent).
In the context of rhythm studies, the notion of a stress-timed language is
often cited, i.e. one where the stresses fall at roughly regular intervals within an
utterance. In analysing such a language in this way, the notion of silent stress
is sometimes invoked, to handle cases where the omission of a stressed syllable
in colloquial speech can none the less be ‘felt’; a regularly cited case in the
abbreviated version of thank you /kjä/, which is said to be the unstressed
residue of an unspoken stressed+unstressed combination. A sequence of syllables
constituting a rhythmical unit, containing one primary stress, is known as a
stress group. In metrical phonology a stress-foot is a string containing as its
ﬁrst element a stressed syllable, followed by zero or more unstressed syllables
symbolized by Σ. The most prominent element in the stress foot is called the
head. It should be noted that ‘foot’, in this context, refers to an underlying
unit, whose phonetic interpretation varies according to the theoretical approach.
Destressing, in this approach, is a rule which eliminates stresses produced by
foot construction. When two stressed syllables are immediately adjacent, the
situation is described as stress clash. Speakers have a tendency to avoid stress
clash; for example, the word thirteen is normally stressed on the second syllable,
stress
455

but in the phrase thirteen men, the stress shifts to the ﬁrst syllable. See also
contour (1).
stress-foot, stress group (n.)

stress-timed (adj.)
A very general term used in phonetics to characterize
the pronunciation of languages displaying a particular type of rhythm; it is
opposed to syllable-timed languages. In stress-timed languages, it is claimed
that the stressed syllables recur at regular intervals of time (stress-timing),
regardless of the number of intervening unstressed syllables, as in English. This
characteristic is referred to as ‘isochronism’, or isochrony. However, it is plain
that this regularity is the case only under certain conditions, and the extent to
which the tendency towards regularity in English is similar to that in, say, other
Germanic languages remains unclear.

stricture (n.)
A general term used in phonetics to refer to an articulation
which restricts the airstream to some degree, ranging from a complete closure
to a slight narrowing. See also articulator-based feature theory.
stridency (n.)
In phonetics, a scale used to characterize sounds (speciﬁcally,
fricatives) in auditory terms on the basis of their perceived pitch and loud-
ness; also called sibilance. Sounds such as [s] are higher on a stridency scale,
being relatively high-pitched and intense (they display more energy at higher
frequencies); sounds such as [f] are much lower (displaying more energy at
lower frequencies).
strident (adj.)
One of the source features of sound set up by Chomsky and
Halle (see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology,
to handle variations in the sibilance of a sound. Strident sounds are deﬁned
articulatorily and acoustically as those sounds produced by a relatively
complex stricture, and marked by relatively high frequency and intensity,
as in [f], [s] and [à]. The opposite term in Jakobson and Halle’s approach (see
Jakobsonian) is mellow; in Chomsky and Halle’s later system it is non-
strident: these are sounds produced by a less complex stricture, and marked by
noise of relatively low frequency and intensity, such as in plosives and nasals.
All vowels are also [−strident]. The allocation of segments to these categories
has been controversial (e.g. whether [f] is + or −strident).
string (n.)
A term used in linguistics, and especially in generative grammar,
to refer to a linear sequence of elements of determinate length and constitu-
tion. Formal analysis also permits the notion of a string consisting of just one
short element, and also one consisting of no elements (see zero in linguistic
456
stress-foot

description) – the empty or null string. A substring is any part of a string
which is itself a string. For example, the following sentence can be seen as a
string of elements: the+cat+sit+Past+on+the+mat. Within this, several substrings
could be recognized, e.g. the+cat, the+cat+sit+Past, etc.
strong (adj.) (1)
See strength (1) (in relation to segments).
(2)
See weight (in relation to syllables).
strong adequacy
see adequacy
strong form
One of two possible pronunciations for a word, in the context
of connected speech, the other being weak. The strong form is that which is
the result of a word being stressed. For example, most of the grammatical
words of English occur in both forms, e.g. I want bacon and eggs v. I want
bacon – and eggs. The notion is also used for syntactically conditioned
alternatives, such as your book v. the book is yours.
strong generative capacity
see capacity
strong generative power
see power
strong verb
In grammar, a term for a verb which changes its root vowel
when changing its tense, as in sing v. sang. The term contrasts with weak verb,
where the past tense is formed by adding an inﬂection, as in kick v. kicked.
The distinction is important in the Germanic languages.
structural (adj.)
A term used in linguistics referring to any approach to the
analysis of language that pays explicit attention to the way in which linguistic
features can be described in terms of structures and systems (structural or
structuralist linguistics). In the general Saussurean sense, structuralist ideas
enter into every school of linguistics. Structuralism does, however, have a more
restricted deﬁnition, referring to the Bloomﬁeldian emphasis on the processes
of segmenting and classifying the physical features of utterance (i.e. on
what Noam Chomsky later called surface structures), with little reference to
the abstract underlying structures (Chomsky’s deep structures) of language
or their meaning. It is this emphasis which the Chomskyan approach to lan-
guage strongly attacked; for generative linguistics, accordingly, the term is
often pejorative.
The contribution of this notion in linguistics is apparent in the more general
concept of structuralism, especially as formulated in the work of the French
anthropologist, Claude Lévi-Strauss (b. 1908), and others. Here, any human
institution or behaviour (e.g. dancing, courtship, religion) is considered analysable
in terms of an underlying network of relationships, and the structures demon-
strated referrable to basic modes of thought. The crucial point is that the
elements which constitute a network have no validity apart from the relations
(of equivalence, contrast, etc.) which hold between them, and it is this network
of relations which constitutes the structures of the system.
Within linguistics, ‘structural’ will be found in several contexts in phonology,
grammar and semantics. Structural(ist) grammar, as a general term, is now a
structural
457

largely dated conception of grammatical analysis, though the emphases which
characterized it may still be seen in several areas of applied linguistic studies
(e.g. in the structural drills of foreign-language teaching), and the term ‘struc-
tural’ is often given a special status as part of the exposition of a grammatical
model, e.g. the notion of structural description in transformational
grammar. Structural semantics is an inﬂuential contemporary position, which is
still in its early stages of analysing the sense relations that interconnect lexemes
and sentences.
structural ambiguity
A term used in linguistics to refer to a construction
with more than one grammatical interpretation in terms of constituent
analysis; also called grammatical ambiguity. A much-used example is old men
and women, which is structurally ambiguous: it may be analysed as [old men]
and women (i.e. only the men are old) or old [men and women] (i.e. both the
men and women are old). In generative grammar, this phenomenon is some-
times referred to as ‘constructional homonymity’.

structural Case
see case (2)
structural change (SC)
A term used in (especially classical) transformational
grammar to refer to the operations involved in applying a transformational
rule, i.e. the changes between the input and the output phrase-markers. In
the transformation of active into passive sentences, for example, the struc-
tural change is complex, involving the reordering of the two noun phrases,
and the insertion of new forms of the verb, and the agent marker by (e.g.
The dog bit the cat v. The cat was bitten by the dog).
structural description (SD)
A term used in (especially classical) transforma-
tional grammar to refer to an analysis of a terminal string in terms of a
labelled bracketing. In transformational analysis, the SD identiﬁes the input to
a transformational rule: it speciﬁes which phrase-markers are to be affected
by the rule, i.e. which will ‘satisfy’ or ‘meet’ the conditions of the rule. The
terms structural analysis and structure index are also used.

structure (n.)
In its most general sense, and especially as deﬁned by structur-
alist studies of human institutions and behaviour, the term applies to the main
abstract characteristic of a semiotic system. A language, for example, is a
structure, in the sense that it is a network of interrelated units, the meaning of
the parts being speciﬁable only with reference to the whole. In this sense, the
458
structural ambiguity

terms ‘structure’ and ‘system’ are often synonymous (and the phrase ‘structured
system’ which is sometimes encountered – as in ‘language is a structured system’
– is a tautology). More speciﬁcally, the term is used to refer to an isolatable
section of this total network, as in discussion of the structure of a particular
grammatical area (e.g. tenses, pronouns), and here ‘structure’ and ‘system’
are distinguished: one might talk of the ‘structure’ of a particular ‘system’.
However, this application of the term to paradigmatic relationships is not
as widespread as the syntagmatic conception of ‘structure’. Here a particular
sequential pattern of linguistic elements is referred to as ‘a structure’, deﬁnable
with reference to one of the various ‘structural levels’ recognized in a theory,
e.g. ‘phonological structure’, ‘syntactic structure’, ‘morphological struc-
ture’, ‘semantic structure’. For example, clause structure can be deﬁned in
terms of strings of such elements as subject, verb and object, or noun
phrases and verb phrases; syllable structure can be deﬁned in terms of strings
of consonants and vowels. The set of items which contrast at a particular
‘place’ in a structure is then referred to as a system. This is the way in which the
term is used in Hallidayan linguistics, for example, where it has a special
status, as the name of one of the four major categories recognized by the
theory (the others being ‘unit’, ‘system’ and ‘class’): the category of ‘structure’
accounts for the ways in which an occurrence of one syntactic unit can be made
up out of occurrences of the unit below it (e.g. which kinds of group structure
can constitute which kinds of clause structure). In this sense, the morpheme has
no structure, being the minimal unit in grammar. A narrower use of the term is
found in the phrase structure index, sometimes used in transformational
grammar to refer to the formal description of the input string to a trans-
formational rule – also known as a structural description. A structure-
preserving constraint is one which imposes the condition that a constituent
can be moved only into another category of the same structural type, which has
been independently generated. Transformations to which this constraint applies
are known as ‘structure-preserving transformations’. See also hierarchy, tree.
structure dependency
A principle used in generative linguistics which
asserts that the speaker’s knowledge of language relies on the structural
relationships between elements in the sentence rather than on the linear
sequence of items. The principle imposes strong constraints on the notion of
‘possible grammatical rule’, and is an essential feature of a theory of universal
grammar.
structure index
see structural description
structure preservation
A principle in lexical phonology which states that
constraints on possible underlying segments in the inventory of a language,
and constraints on autosegmental associations, hold throughout the deriva-
tion during the lexical part of the phonology. These constraints are dropped
during the post-lexical part of the phonology.

style (n.)

style
459

stylistics (n.)
A branch of linguistics which studies the features of situationally
distinctive uses (varieties) of language, and tries to establish principles cap-
able of accounting for the particular choices made by individual and social
groups in their use of language. General stylistics deals with the whole range (or
repertoire) of non-dialectal varieties encountered within a language; literary
stylistics deals with the variations characteristic of literature as a genre and of
the ‘style’ of individual authors. Applied stylistics is often used for the study of
contextually distinctive varieties of language, especially with reference to the
style of literary and non-literary texts. The quantiﬁcation of stylistic patterns is
the province of stylostatistics (or stylometry) – a ﬁeld which usually studies the
statistical structure of literary texts, often using computers. The study of the
expressive or aesthetic function of sound is sometimes called phonostylistics.
The term ‘stylistics’ is occasionally used in a very broad sense, to include all
situationally distinctive language – that is, including the variations of regional,
social and historical dialects. It is more common, however, to see style used in a
highly restricted sense – though the extremely broad and ambiguous reference of
the term in everyday use has not made its status as a technical linguistic term
very appealing. For example, in the hallidayan classiﬁcation of language
varieties, style (more fully, style of discourse) refers to the relations among the
participants in a language activity, especially the level of formality they adopt
(colloquial, formal, etc.). Alternative terms used by some linguists, presumably
to avoid the ambiguity of an additional sense for the term ‘style’, include
manner and tenor. The main terms with which it contrasts in the Hallidayan
model are mode and ﬁeld. A similar conception of style in terms of ‘vertical’
formality level is found in many sociolinguistic studies. In some contexts
(such as generative grammar), stylistic rules refer to optional processes which
highlight an element in a sentence. Style-shifting refers to the way speakers
within a language may alternate between styles in order to achieve a particular
effect. See also code.

sub-categorization (n.)
An application of the general use of this term in lin-
guistics and especially in generative grammar, to refer to the further
subclassiﬁcation of a syntactic category. In the Aspects model, the function
of strict sub-categorization features is to specify a class of restrictions operating
on the choice of verbs (and other elements) in deep structure. Related
notions include category and selectional features. The category verb is
sub-categorized in terms of its sister-nodes within the verb phrase – whether or
not it permits a following noun-phrase object. This distinction might be
summarized using a sub-categorization frame, which speciﬁes the range of sister
constituents which a lexical item takes, as in such cases of verb complementa-
tion as ‘go −[−NP]’, ‘kick +[−NP]’.

subjacency (n.)
A term used in extended standard theory and government-
binding theory to refer to a type of condition which restricts the application
of a transformational rule; it is the main principle of bounding theory.
The subjacency condition states that a constituent cannot be moved (in any
single application) across more than one bounding node. For example, in the
sentence The story that [[the quarrel about payNP] was wrongS] is irrelevant,
the brackets mark the place of the constituent boundaries np and s. To move the
phrase about pay to the right of wrong is possible, because only one bounding
node has been crossed; but it is not possible to move this phrase to the right of
irrelevant, according to the subjacency condition, because then both the NP and
S nodes would be crossed. It has been argued that it is possible to subsume
several earlier island constraints under this condition, which is claimed to be
more general and natural as a consequence.
subject (n.) (S, sub, SUB, Subj, SUBJ)
A term used in the analysis of gram-
matical functions to refer to a major constituent of sentence or clause
structure, traditionally associated with the ‘doer’ of an action, as in The cat bit
the dog. The oldest approaches make a twofold distinction in sentence analysis
between subject and predicate, and this is still common, though not always in
this terminology; other approaches distinguish subject from a series of other
elements of structure (object, complement, verb, adverbial, in particular).
Linguistic analyses have emphasized the complexity involved in this notion,
distinguishing, for example, the grammatical subject from the underlying or
logical subject of a sentence, as in The cat was chased by the dog, where The cat
is the grammatical and the dog the logical subject. Not all subjects, moreover,
can be analysed as doers of an action, as in such sentences as Dirt attracts ﬂies
and The books sold well. The deﬁnition of subjects in terms of surface gram-
matical features (using word-order or inﬂectional criteria) is usually relat-
ively straightforward, but the speciﬁcation of their function is more complex,
and has attracted much discussion (e.g. in relational grammar). In generative
grammar, subject is sometimes deﬁned as the NP immediately dominated by S.
While NP is the typical formal realization of subject, other categories can have
this function, e.g. clause (S-bar), as in That oil ﬂoats on water is a fact, and PP,
as in Between 6 and 9 will suit me. The term is also encountered in such
contexts as raising and the speciﬁed-subject condition.
In the study of inﬂected languages, subjective may be used as an alternative to
nominative; e.g. in English the contrast between subject and object forms of
pronouns (e.g. he ~ him) is sometimes referred to as a distinction between
subjective and objective case. The term ‘subjective genitive’ is also used (as in
the playing of the musicians = ‘musicians play’), in contrast with the objective
genitive (as in the building of the house = ‘X built the house’). See also comple-
ment, raising.

subjunct (n.)
A term used in Quirk grammar to refer to a subclass of
adverbials along with adjuncts, disjuncts and conjuncts. In early work
‘subjuncts’ were grouped within the category of ‘adjuncts’; in later work, however,
they were felt to be sufﬁciently different in semantic and syntactic behaviour
to warrant their ‘equal’ status with the other subclasses. Subjuncts include a
wide range of adverbials which have a subordinate role in comparison with
other clause elements. They include several classes of item, such as the expres-
sion of viewpoint (e.g. Morally, that is wrong), courtesy (e.g. Come in, please)
and emphasis (e.g. actually, frankly).
subjunctive (n.) (subj, SUBJ, subjun)
A term used in the grammatical classi-
ﬁcation of sentence types, and usually seen in contrast to indicative, imper-
ative, etc., moods. It refers to verb forms or sentence/clause types used in the
expression of many kinds of subordinate clause, for a range of attitudes
including tentativeness, vagueness, uncertainty. In modern English, the examples
which come nearest to the subjunctive occur in ‘hypothetical’ constructions
of the type if she were going (cf. if she was going), in certain formulae (e.g. So
be it!), and in some clauses introduced by that (especially in American English,
e.g. I insist that he go to town). In many languages, it is more productive,
e.g. in French.

subordination (n.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to the pro-
cess or result of linking linguistic units so that they have different syntactic
status, one being dependent upon the other, and usually a constituent of the
other; subordinate is sometimes contrasted with superordinate. (In this respect,
it is usually distinguished from co-ordinate linkage, where the units are
equivalent.) Subordinate clauses are illustrated in the sentence John left when
the bus arrived: the marker of linkage is when, a subordinating conjunction (or
subordinator). A wide range of subordinates exists in English, e.g. although,
since, because, while, after. Some grammarians analyse certain subordinators
(e.g. before, since, until) as prepositions with sentential complements. In
endocentric phrases, the term ‘subordinate’ is also used to refer to the words
which modify the head; e.g. in all the very big cars, all the very big is subordinate
to cars, and very is subordinate to big.

substance (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the undifferentiated raw
material out of which language is constructed – the sound waves of speech
(phonic substance), the marks of writing (graphic substance). ‘Substance’ is
here opposed to form – the abstract pattern of relationships imposed on this
substance by a language. In Saussurean theory, meaning too is conceived as
having substance, namely, the conceptual store of thoughts, feelings, etc., which
exist independently of language. In modern linguistics, however, the term tends
to be restricted to the phonetic and graphetic media (as in Hallidayan
theory, where ‘substance’ is recognized as a separate level).
substandard (adj.)
see standard
substantive (n.) (1)
A term used in linguistic theory to refer to a category of
linguistic universal; opposed to formal. Substantive (or substantival) universals
are the primitive elements which a grammar establishes in order to analyse
linguistic data, e.g. S, NP, VP, [+human], [+high] in generative grammar, or
subject, verb, object, etc., in relational models.
(2)
In some descriptive grammars, substantive is a term used in the classi-
ﬁcation of words, referring to the class of nouns (traditionally deﬁned as
‘substances’, i.e. names of persons, places, things, etc.), and also to those items
which function as nouns, though lacking some of the formal characteristics of
that class (cf. the ‘substantival function’ of adjectives, in the poor, the rich,
etc.). The set of pronouns may also be included in this class.
substitution (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to the process or result of
replacing one item by another at a particular place in a structure. In gram-
mar, the structural context within which this replacement occurs is known as
a substitution frame, e.g. The — is angry, and the set of items which can be used
paradigmatically at a given place is known as a substitution class. A word
which refers back to a previously occurring element of structure (such as the
pronoun he in The man came in. He was smiling.) may be called a substitute
word. In government-binding theory, substitution is one of the two main
types of movement process (the other being adjunction); it involves the moved
category replacing an empty category of the same kind in accordance with the
structure-preserving constraint. In language teaching, exercises to improve
the ability of learners to carry out a process of item replacement are known as
substitution drills (or ‘pattern drills’).
substrate (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics and historical linguistics to
refer to a linguistic variety or set of forms which has inﬂuenced the struc-
ture or use of a more dominant variety or language within a community. A
substrate language (linguistic substrate or substratum) is particularly evidenced
when a language is imposed on a community, as a result of political or economic
substrate
463

superiority, as can be seen in the many varieties of English spoken throughout
the world which incorporate characteristics of a mother-tongue, e.g. in India,
West Africa. The opposite effect is known as a superstratum.

suction (adj.)
One of the features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle (see
Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phonology, under the
heading of supplementary movements, to handle variations in manner of
articulation. It refers to articulatory movements of the glottis or velum (see
velar) where the airﬂow is directed inwards, as implosives and clicks. See
also stop.
sufﬁx (n.) (1) (SUFF)
A term used in morphology referring to an afﬁx which
is added following a root or stem. The process of sufﬁxation or sufﬁxing is
common in English, both for the derivational formation of new lexical
items (e.g. -ize, -tion) and for expressing grammatical relationships (inﬂec-
tional endings such as -s, -ed, -ing).

Summer Institute of Linguistics
(now known as SIL International) An organiza-
tion devoted to the training of linguists wishing to do research into the (especially
unwritten) languages of the world. Founded by William Cameron Townsend
(1896–1982) in 1934, it developed to become the leading organization for
training ﬁeld linguists, eventually working on over 2000 languages. As a Chris-
tian organization, it has specialized in Bible translation, with over 700 trans-
lations of the New Testament now completed. Its ﬁrst president was Kenneth
Lee Pike (1912–2000), who was associated with SIL from 1942 until his
death. Its language catalogue Ethnologue listed 6,912 languages in 2005 (15th
edition).
superﬁx (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to a vocal
effect which extends over more than one sound segment in an utterance, such
as a pitch, stress or juncture pattern, particularly when this is seen in the
464
substratum

context of a speciﬁc grammatical structure; also called a supraﬁx. The term
suprasegmental is however now widely used instead.
superfoot (n.)
A term in metrical phonology for a node which dominates
the two rightmost feet in a metrical tree; symbolized by Σ′. For example, in the
tree structure for reconciliation, the node governing the two stress feet (Σ) cil-i
and a-tion is a superfoot.
superheavy syllable
see weight
superiority (n.)
A constraint proposed in government-binding theory
and the minimalist programme which states that in multiple WH-questions,
the wh-phrase that C-commands the other moves to the CP-speciﬁer. This
would make What did you put where? grammatical, but *Where did you put
what? not.
superlative (adj./n.)
A term used in the three-way grammatical description of
adjectives and adverbs into degrees, specifying the extent of their applica-
tion. The superlative form is used to express a comparison between more than
two entities, and contrasts with comparative, where only two entities are
involved, and positive, where no comparison is implied. In English there is
both an inﬂection (-est) and a periphrastic construction (most) to express
this notion (e.g. biggest, most interesting).
superordinate (adj.)
A term sometimes used in grammatical description to
refer to a linguistic unit higher up a hierarchy than another (subordinate)
unit. For example, in John saw where Mary lived, John saw (or, John saw X) is
the superordinate clause while where Mary lived is the subordinate clause. The
term is also used in other areas of linguistics to refer to higher-order units,
such as the more inclusive lexical item in hyponymy (ﬂower is the superordinate
label for tulip, daffodil, etc.).
superstratum (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics and historical linguistics
to refer to a linguistic variety or set of forms which has inﬂuenced the
structure or use of a less dominant variety or language within a community.
A linguistic superstratum is usually the result of political, economic or cultural
dominance, as illustrated by the inﬂuence of English, French, Arabic, etc., on the
languages of the world at various periods in history. One of the most noticeable
features of superstratal inﬂuence is the increased use of loan words.
supertype (n.)
see type
supervaluation (n.)
A technique used in logic and formal semantics for dealing
with complex sentences containing constituent clauses which are neither
true nor false, as in some analyses of presupposition or vagueness. A sentence
is assigned the value supertrue if it is true relative to all ways of resolving the
truth value of any constituent clauses which lack a truth value, and superfalse
if it is false relative to all ways of resolving such truth values.

supplementary movements
One of the types of sound feature set up by Chomsky
and Halle (see Chomskyan) in their distinctive feature theory of phono-
logy, to handle variations in manner of articulation. They are subdivided
into suction and pressure types, a distinction made on the basis of the
ingressive or egressive glottal or velar movement involved in sounds with
two simultaneous closures, as in implosives, ejectives and clicks.
suppletion (n.)
A term used in morphology to refer to cases where it is not
possible to show a relationship between morphemes through a general rule,
because the forms involved have different roots. A suppletive is the grammar’s
use of an unrelated form (i.e. with a different root) to complete a paradigm, as
in the present–past-tense relationship of go ~ went, or the comparative form
better in relation to good.

supraglottal (adj.)
A general term used in phonetics to refer to the whole area
of the vocal tract above the glottis.
suprasegmental (adj./n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer
to a vocal effect which extends over more than one sound segment in an
utterance, such as a pitch, stress or juncture pattern. In its contrast with
‘segmental’, it is seen as one of two main classes into which phonological units
can be divided. In American structuralist theories, suprasegmentals were
analysed as phonemes and sequences of such features as morphemes, but not
all phonologists analyse these features in emic terms. Alternative terms are
plurisegmental, non-segmental and superﬁx.
surface grammar
see surface structure
surface structure
A central theoretical term in transformational grammar,
opposed to deep structure. The ‘surface structure’ of a sentence is the ﬁnal
stage in the syntactic representation of a sentence, which provides the input
to the phonological component of the grammar, and which thus most closely
corresponds to the structure of the sentence we articulate and hear. Analysing
a surface string of morphemes through constituent analysis is a universal
procedure which indicates many important facts about linguistic structure;
but it by no means indicates everything, e.g. it cannot explain how we recognize
certain ambiguous sentences, or how we intuitively relate sentences which
have different surface forms but the same basic meaning (e.g. Cats chase mice
and Mice are chased by cats). For such reasons, linguists in the late 1950s
postulated a deep or ‘underlying’ structure for sentences – a level of structural
organization in which all the factors determining structural interpretation are
deﬁned and interrelated. The standard view was that a grammar operates
by generating a set of abstract deep structures, subsequently converting these
underlying representations into surface structures by applying a set of trans-
formational rules. This two-level conception of grammatical structure came
466
supplementary movements

to be much criticized in later generative studies. An alternative conception
related surface structure directly to a semantic level of representation, bypassing
deep structure altogether. Later models introduce a modiﬁed notion known as
S-structure. The term surface grammar is sometimes used as an informal term
for the superﬁcial properties of the sentence.

switching (n.)
see code
switch reference
A means of showing the semantic relationship between clause
elements (typically, the subjects) in a chain of clauses. In a given chain, the
verb of each clause except the last indicates morphologically whether its
subject is the same (SS, same subject) as the subject of the following clause, or
different from it (DS, different subject). Switch-reference marking has been noted
in several Australian Aboriginal languages. See reference.
syllable (n.) (syll)
A unit of pronunciation typically larger than a single sound
and smaller than a word. A word may be pronounced ‘syllable at a time’, as in
ne-ver-the-less, and a good dictionary will indicate where these syllabic divisions
occur in writing, thus providing information about how a word may be hyphen-
ated. The notion of syllable, in short, is very real to native-speakers, and is
often used in a quasi-technical sense in everyday conversation (e.g. Shall I put it
in words of one syllable?). Syllabiﬁcation is the term which refers to the division
of a word into syllables; resyllabiﬁcation refers to a reanalysis which alters
the location of syllable boundaries. A word containing a single syllable is called
a monosyllable; if it contains more than one, the term polysyllable is used (or
monosyllabic word/polysyllabic word respectively).
Providing a precise deﬁnition of the syllable is not an easy task, and there
are several theories in both phonetics and phonology which have tried to
clarify matters. From a phonetic viewpoint, attempts have been made to deﬁne
the syllables of a language on the basis of the articulatory effort needed in
order to produce them. The ‘pulse’ or ‘motor’ theory of syllable production
proposed by the psychologist R. H. Stetson (1892–1950) argued that each
syllable corresponds to an increase in air pressure, air from the lungs being
released as a series of chest pulses. This can often be readily felt and measured,
particularly in emphatic speech; but it is also often difﬁcult to detect such a
pulse in adjacent syllables, as when two vowels co-occur, e.g. going (which
is two syllables, but usually said in a single muscular effort). An alternative
phonetic approach attempts to deﬁne the syllable in auditory terms: the pro-
minence theory argues that, in a string of sounds, some are intrinsically
more ‘sonorous’ than others, and that each ‘peak’ of sonority corresponds
to the centre of a syllable. These peaks are best illustrated by vowels, which
have the greater carrying-power. The less sonorous sounds provide ‘valleys’
of prominence, and are best illustrated by the closures and narrowings which
syllable
467

produce consonants. This approach gives a useful general guideline, but it
does not always indicate clearly where the boundary between adjacent syllables
falls, e.g. in busker, the problem of whether to split the word as bus-ker,
bu-sker or busk-er is not answerable using arguments based on perceived sonor-
ity. The problem remains, even if other acoustic features than sonority (such as
pitch or length) are incorporated within the notion of prominence, but has
been speciﬁcally addressed in some phonological theories (notably metrical
phonology).
Phonetic approaches of this kind attempt to provide a deﬁnition of the syllable
valid for all languages, and it is possible that more valid deﬁnitions in terms of
speech production or perception will emerge. Phonological views of the syllable,
on the other hand, focus on the ways sounds combine in individual languages to
produce typical sequences. Here, two classes of sounds are usually established:
sounds which can occur on their own, or at the centre of a sequence of sounds,
and sounds which cannot occur on their own, or which occur at the edges of a
sequence of sounds. The former include such sounds as [i], [a], [u], etc., and are
generally referred to as vowels; the latter include such sounds as [p], [ì], [f],
[ Ä], etc., and are generally referred to as consonants. A consonant–vowel
(CV) sequence is a pattern which seems to be found in all languages: because the
syllable is not ‘closed’ by another consonant, this type of syllable is often called
an open syllable type. A CVC pattern is also very common in English. In such a
case, the following terminology is widely used:
the opening segment of a syllable = the onset,
the closing segment of the syllable = the coda,
the central segment of the syllable = the centre or nucleus.
A useful collective term for the opening and closing segments is the margins (or
edges) of the syllable. In metrical phonology, the nucleus and coda are
viewed as a single constituent of syllable structure, called the rhyme (or rime),
and syllables are distinguished phonologically in terms of their weight.
Using such methods, syllables can be deﬁned in terms of the way the sound
segments of a language function. In this way, for instance, one can identify the
various clusters of segments which may occur at syllable margins, such as CV
(say), CCV (play), CCCV (stray), etc. Exceptional syllables can also be identi-
ﬁed, such as those where certain consonants occur alone to form the syllable –
the nasals and laterals in words such as button [bÎtÚ] and bottle [b∞t;],
where [a] indicates that the ﬁnal consonant is a syllabic consonant.
The notion of syllable is widely used elsewhere in phonology, e.g. in relation to
prosody and cross-linguistic studies of rhythm (see syllable-timed language).
In the distinctive feature theory of phonology proposed by Chomsky and
Halle (see Chomskyan), syllabic is used to replace the earlier term ‘vocalic’,
referring to all segments constituting a syllabic nucleus. Vowels, liquids and
nasals would be [+syllabic] ([+syll]); all other segments would be [−syll]. In later
approaches to phonology, the notion of syllable has become increasingly import-
ant, especially in models of non-linear phonology. Here, syllabiﬁcation (and
resyllabiﬁcation) are interpreted in relation to questions of representation –
how and at what point syllable structure is assigned to strings in a derivation,
and which phonological rules are involved in syllabiﬁcation. Several models
468
syllable

recognize a prosodic hierarchy in which the syllable plays a role: in prosodic
morphology, for example, it is a level above the mora and below the foot.
See also coda, onset (1), tautosyllabic.
syllable-timed (adj.)
A very general term used in phonetics to characterize the
pronunciation of languages displaying a particular type of rhythm; it is
opposed to stress-timed languages. In syllable-timed languages, the syllables
are said to occur at regular intervals of time, as in French; this characteristic is
sometimes referred to as isosyllabism or isosyllabicity. However, very little work
has been done on the accuracy or general applicability of such properties, and
the usefulness of the typology has been questioned.
symbol (n.)

symbolic (adj.)

sympathetic constraints

sympathy (n.)
A term in optimality theory referring to the calculation of
opaque forms. A hypothetical winner, the sympathetic candidate, is chosen by
a different ranking of constraints. The ﬁnal output is calculated by adding
constraints mandating faithfulness to the sympathetic candidate. A sympa-
thetic candidate is symbolized by + in an optimality tableau.
synaesthesia/synesthesia (n.)
A term used in semantics to refer to a direct
association between the form and the meaning of language. For example, the
sl- sound combination is often felt to express unpleasantness (cf. slimy, slither,
etc., – and Lewis Carroll’s slithy). Such sound-symbolic units are sometimes
called phonaesthemes.
synchronic (adj.)
One of the two main temporal dimensions of linguistics
investigation introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure (see Saussurean), the other
being diachronic. In synchronic linguistics, languages are studied at a theoret-
ical point in time: one describes a ‘state’ of the language, disregarding whatever
changes might be taking place. For example, one could carry out a synchronic
description of the language of Chaucer, or of the sixteenth century, or of
modern-day English. Most synchronic descriptions are of contemporary language
states, but their importance as a preliminary to diachronic study has been stressed
since Saussure. Linguistic investigations, unless speciﬁed to the contrary, are
assumed to be synchronic; they display synchronicity.
syncope /cs}ºkvpip/ (n.)
A term used in comparative philology, and some-
times in modern phonology, to refer to the deletion of a vowel within a
word; often contrasted with aphaeresis and apocope. Examples include the
modern British English pronunciations of such words as secretary /csekr}tri/,
where American English has /csekr}teri/. Some authors extend the notion to
include internal consonant deletion.
syncretism (n.)
A term originally used in historical linguistics (referring to
the merging of forms following the loss of inﬂections), and now often used
syncretism
469

synchronically to refer to identity between two forms of the same lexeme,
e.g walked in I walked (where it is past tense) and I’ve walked (where it is past
participle). The distinction is here syncretized, or ‘neutralized’.
syndeton (n.)
A term from Greek rhetorical tradition, and sometimes used
in modern grammar, to refer to the use of conjunctions to link parts of a
syntactic construction, as in They spoke rapidly and quietly. It contrasts with
asyndeton, which describes the omission of conjunctions, especially in order to
achieve an economical or dramatic form of expression, as in They spoke rapidly,
quietly. Adjectival uses are syndetic and asyndetic respectively.
synonymy (n.)
A term used in semantics to refer to a major type of sense
relation between lexical items: lexical items which have the same meanings
are synonyms. For two items to be synonyms, it does not mean that they should
be identical in meaning, i.e. interchangeable in all contexts, and with ident-
ical connotations – this unlikely possibility is sometimes referred to as
total synonymy. Synonymy can be said to occur if items are close enough in
their meaning to allow a choice to be made between them in some contexts,
without there being any difference for the meaning of the sentence as a whole.
Linguistic studies of synonymy have emphasized the importance of context in
deciding whether a set of lexical items is synonymous. For example, in the
context What a nice — of ﬂowers, the items range, selection, choice, etc., are
synonymous; but in the context Her — of knowledge is enormous, only range
can be used, along with a different set of synonyms, e.g. breadth. Synonymy is
distinguished from such other sense relations as antonymy, hyponymy and
incompatibility.

syntagmatic (adj.) (1)
A fundamental term in linguistics, originally intro-
duced by Ferdinand de Saussure (see Saussurean) to refer to the sequential
characteristics of speech, seen as a string of constituents (sometimes, but not
always) in linear order. The relationships between constituents (syntagms or
syntagmas) in a construction are generally called syntagmatic relations. Sets
of syntagmatically related constituents are often referred to as structures.
Syntagmatic relations, together with paradigmatic relations, constitute the state-
ment of a linguistic unit’s identity within the language system. For example,
the function of /p/ in English phonology can be summarized by identifying
its syntagmatic relationships (e.g. p-it, ni-p, a-p-t . . . ) and the paradigmatic
relationships it contracts with other elements (e.g. p-it, b-it, n-it . . . ). Syntagmatic
470
syndeton

relationships can be established at all levels of analysis. In tagmemic gram-
mar, however, the term syntagmeme is used in a restricted sense, referring to
a unit in a grammatical hierarchy seen from the viewpoint of the elements
(or tagmemes) it includes; e.g. the sentence is a syntagmeme for the clauses
that constitute it.
(2)
In psycholinguistics, the term is sometimes used to refer to a class of
associative responses which people make when hearing a stimulus word, viz.
those which fall into a different word-class from the stimulus, in that the
response word could precede or follow the stimulus word in a sentence. A syn-
tagmatic response or association would be drive following car, sheep following
black, etc. The syntagmatic/paradigmatic shift refers to a change in the patterns
of response noted in children at around age seven, when the earlier pattern
(of primarily syntagmatic associations) develops into the more adult-like pattern
primarily involving paradigmatic associations.
syntagmeme (n.)
see syntagmatic (1), tagmemics
syntax (n.)
A traditional term for the study of the rules governing the way
words are combined to form sentences in a language. In this use, syntax is
opposed to morphology, the study of word structure. An alternative deﬁnition
(avoiding the concept of ‘word’) is the study of the interrelationships between
elements of sentence structure, and of the rules governing the arrangement
of sentences in sequences. In this use, one might then talk of the ‘syntax of the
word’. In initial formulations of generative linguistics, the syntactic component
is one of three major organizational units within a grammar (the others being
phonological and semantic), containing rules for the generation of syntactic
structures (e.g. phrase-structure rules, transformational rules). The exact
nature of the syntactic rules within this component varies from one grammatical
theory to another. Syntactic structures (patterns, or constructions) are
analysable into sequences of syntactic categories or syntactic classes, these being
established on the basis of the syntactic relationships linguistic items have with
other items in a construction. Some studies propose an analysis whereby cat-
egories are analysed as sets of syntactic features, to permit a greater degree of
generalization across categories. For example, using the features V (= verbal) and
N (= nominal), it is suggested that the four categories of verb, noun, adjective
and preposition can be analysed respectively as:
syntax
471
This kind of approach is referred to as feature-based syntax. Both positive and
negative sub-categorization features can be used, either singly or in combina-
tion, depending on the syntactic facts and on the analytic principles proposed.
The study of the ﬁeld as a whole is known as syntactic theory. Studying the
sequential arrangements of syntax is sometimes referred to as syntactics, but
there is a possibility of confusion here with the earlier use of this term as one of
the three major divisions of semiotics (along with pragmatics and semantics).
The adjective form of ‘syntax’ in modern linguistics is syntactic, as in the above
G+VJ, G−VJ, G+VJ and G−VJ.

synthesis (n.)
see speech synthesis
synthetic (adj.) (1)
A term which characterizes a type of language sometimes
distinguished in comparative linguistics using structural (as opposed to
diachronic) criteria, and focusing on the characteristics of the word: in syn-
thetic languages, words typically contain more than one morpheme (as opposed
to analytic languages, where words are typically monomorphemic). Two types
of synthetic language are usually recognized: agglutinative and inﬂecting
– with polysynthetic sometimes additionally distinguished. Examples include
Latin, Greek, Arabic, Turkish. As always in such classiﬁcations, the categories
are not clear-cut: different languages will display the characteristic of ‘synthesis’
to a greater or lesser degree.
(2)
Some use is made in semantics of the sense of ‘synthetic’ found in logic and
philosophy, where a synthetic proposition/sentence is one whose truth can be
veriﬁed only by using empirical criteria, e.g. It’s raining, Those dogs are ﬁerce.
The term contrasts with analytic, where the internal form of the proposition
makes it necessarily true, without reference to external criteria.
system (n.)
In its most general sense, the term refers to a network of patterned
relationships constituting the organization of language. Language as a whole is
then characterized as a system (cf. the ‘linguistic system of English’, etc.) – and
often as a hierarchically ordered arrangement of systems. In one view, the
‘language system’ is constituted by the phonological, grammatical and semantic
systems; the phonological system comprises the segmental and supraseg-
mental systems; the segmental system comprises the vowel and consonant
systems; and so on.
Within this totality, the term ‘system’ may be applied to any ﬁnite set of form-
ally or semantically connected units (referred to variously as the ‘terms’ or
‘members’ of the system), where the interrelationships are mutually exclusive
(i.e. two members of the same system cannot co-occur) and mutually deﬁning
(i.e. the meaning of one member is speciﬁable only with reference to others). For
example, the set of personal pronouns in a language constitutes a system,
according to these criteria. First, it is ﬁnite (in English, basic forms are I, you,
he, she, it, we, they); the system is ‘closed’, in the sense that new members
are not normally created. Second, it is not possible to use more than one at a
given place in a structure (cf. *I you came, etc.). Third, it is easier to deﬁne
a member by referring to the other members of the system, rather than inde-
pendently; e.g. I is ‘the pronoun which is not you/he/she/it/we/they’. Other
‘grammatical systems’ would include determiner/tense/mood/prepositional/
negation, etc. The term would not normally be applied to open-class items,
such as nouns, adjectives, sentences, etc., unless it meant the set of formal
grammatical relationships subsumed under that heading, e.g. the ‘noun system’
would mean the set of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships which
deﬁne the class of nouns. The analysis is also applicable in principle to the
study of meanings, and the term ‘semantic system’ is often used; but in the
present state of knowledge it is often difﬁcult to model the interrelationship
472
synthesis

between semantic units according to criteria such as the above. A similar problem
sometimes applies in grammatical analysis, where a full ‘systemic’ statement is
difﬁcult to establish in certain areas (e.g. adverbials, apposition), partly because
of the indeterminacy of the notions involved.
In Hallidayan linguistics, the notion of system receives a special status.
In scale-and-category grammar, it is one of the four central categories recog-
nized by the theory (the others being unit, structure and class): ‘systems’ are
ﬁnite sets of paradigmatically related items functioning in classes. In the later
development of this approach, systemic grammar, the notion of system is
made a central explanatory principle, the whole of language being conceived
as a ‘system of systems’. Systemic here should not be confused with ‘systematic’
(in either its general or technical uses; see below): systemic grammar is con-
cerned to establish a network of systems of relationships, in the above sense,
which will account for all the semantically relevant choices in the language as a
whole.
The adjective systematic is often used in linguistics in its everyday sense, but in
certain contexts (usually in relation to phonetics and phonology) it receives a
restricted deﬁnition. In generative grammar, it has been used to refer to two
levels of representation in the phonological component of the grammar:
systematic phonemic and systematic phonetic levels are distinguished, the
implication being that the terms of these analyses are being seen as in systemic
correspondence with other aspects of the grammar (e.g. the morphological
relationships between items).
system architecture
A computing term used in computational linguistics,
referring to the set of superordinate principles which deﬁne the operations of a
language processing system. System architectures specify the components of
such a system, the structural relations between the components, and the way
information can be controlled as it ﬂows from one component to another during
processing.
systematic phonemics
A level of representation in generative phonology
which sets up a single underlying form capable of accounting for the phono-
logical variations which relate grammatical structures (e.g. words). In such
pairs of words as divine ~ divinity, obscene ~ obscenity, there is plainly a regular
relationship of some kind, but it is not an easy relationship to state explicitly.
Chomsky and Halle (see Chomskyan), in their approach to this problem, argue
that the root morpheme in each pair of words can be given a single underlying
representation (/div3n/ and /obs2n/ in the above cases), and that this, along with
the rules which relate such representations to the surface alternants, accounts
for the native-speaker’s awareness of the ‘systematic’ relationships which exist
between grammar and phonology. (Such rules also often reﬂect sound changes
which have taken place in the history of the language.) The units in these
representations are referred to as systematic phonemes, as opposed to the ‘autonom-
ous’ phonemes of traditional phonemic phonology, which are established
without reference to grammatical structure. Some generative phonologists (such
as Chomsky and Halle) prefer the term ‘phonological’ to refer to this level of
representation, because of the undesirable associations of the term ‘phonemic’
with traditional phonemic theory.
systematic phonemics
473

systematic phonetics
A level of representation in generative phonology
which provides a narrow phonetic transcription of the systematic features
of pronunciation, i.e. excluding those which would be attributable to perform-
ance factors. It is related by the rules of the grammar’s phonological com-
ponent to the systematic phonemic level of representation.

tableau (n.), plural tableaux (n.)
A term used in optimality theory for a
table of rows and columns used to demonstrate the evaluator process. The top
leftmost cell contains the input representation to which candidate forms are
being related. The relevant candidates are listed beneath this, with the optimal can-
didate indicated by a hand symbol (+). The relevant constraints are listed across
the top of the table, the higher rankings being shown from highest on the left
to lowest on the right. Solid lines between constraints indicate crucial rankings;
broken lines indicate non-crucial rankings. Asterisks show constraint violations,
with an exclamation mark showing a violation which completely eliminates a
candidate. A shaded area indicates a constraint that has become irrelevant because
of the violation of a higher-ranked constraint. In the following tableau, taken
from a 1997 introductory account by Diana Archangeli, a Yawelmani input form
/xat-en/ ‘will eat’ is shown with four possible candidates. The optimal candidate
is /xa.ten/ as its only violation is the lowest-ranked constraint, NoCoda. A
series of related tableaux, each presenting the role of an individual input, can be
combined into a single tableau des tableaux. In the analysis of syntax, the
mechanism of a subtableau presents a partial structuring of the syntactic input.

tactic (adj.), tactics (n.)

tag (adj./n.) (1)
A term used in grammatical description to refer to a ques-
tion structure (a tag question) usually consisting of an auxiliary verb plus
pronoun, attached to the end of a statement in order to convey a negative or
positive orientation. It may be invariable, as in French n’est-ce pas, German
nicht wahr, or variable, as in English. In all cases, the intonation in which
the tag is uttered determines its function – the contrast between ‘asking’ and
‘telling’, illustrated by English she’s late, isn’t she? (‘I am asking you if she is
late’) v. she’s late, isn’t she! (‘I am asking you to agree with me that she is late’).
In English, in addition to this, the polarity of the tag is usually the reverse
of that found in the main clause: a positive clause takes a negative tag, and
vice versa, e.g. she’s leaving, isn’t she/she isn’t leaving, is she. Sometimes, two
positive clauses are found (she’s leaving, is she), and, very rarely, two negatives
(she doesn’t know, doesn’t she). Some grammars also recognize tag statements
(e.g. That was a lovely drink, that was; He’s a nice man, is John) and there are
some close connections between this construction and such ‘reinforcing’ pat-
terns as They’re all the same, these phoneticians! See also checking, copying.

A grammatical label attached to a word in a computer corpus to indic-
ate its class, in a procedure known as tagging. Tags may be added manually or
automatically (the latter at present with varying degrees of success).

tagmemics (n.)
A system of linguistic analysis developed by the American
linguist Kenneth Lee Pike (1912–2000), and used by the Summer Institute of
Linguistics for the training of linguists. language is seen as comprising three
modes – phonology, lexicon and grammar. The relationship phonology:
phoneme and lexicon:morpheme is paralleled by grammar:tagmeme. This basic
grammatical unit consists of a ‘functional slot’ within a construction frame,
and a class of substitutable items that can ﬁll this slot (‘ﬁllers’). The identity of
the tagmeme is in its correlation of function and form, with both being explicitly
labelled in the analysis (such functions as subject, predicate, head, modiﬁer
and such forms as pronouns, noun phrases, inﬁnitives). Tagmemic analysis in-
volves a distinction between essential units (the tagmemes) and the non-essential
units (the minimal etic units, called tagmas, which are analysed as allotagmas of
the tagmeme). The identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of tagmas is the province of
tagmatics. The constructions which result from the stringing together of tagmemes
are known as syntagmemes. Grammatical units are organized hierarchically into
levels (morphemes, words, phrases, clauses, sentences, etc.). Units of lan-
guage description, at any level in this approach, can be analysed simultaneously
as particle (in terms of features), wave (in terms of their status as variants
manifested in different contexts) and ﬁeld (in terms of their distribution).

tap (n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on
the basis of their manner of articulation: it refers to any sound produced by
a single rapid contact with the roof of the mouth by the tongue, resembling
a very brief articulation of a stop. It is commonly heard in many American
English pronunciations of the medial /t/ or /d/ in writer and rider. Some phon-
eticians distinguish between taps and ﬂaps in terms of the articulatory move-
ments involved.
target (n.) (1)
A term used in phonetics and psycholinguistics to refer to
a hypothetical articulatory state used as a reference point when describing
speech production in dynamic terms. In connected speech, the target
articulatory features for a sound (e.g. alveolar, voicing) may not be fully
attained, because of the anticipatory inﬂuence of successive target articulations.
The target model postulates an idealized set of articulatory positions and a set
of rules which attempt to predict actual patterns of articulatory movement,
taking into account such factors as speed of articulation, and the direction and
distance between articulators. Similarly, models of speech perception have
been proposed which use the construct of an auditory target, which enables the
listener to identify the common factors in different accents, voice qualities,
etc. The term is also used in the description of speech segments as a linear
combination of a limited set of vectors (‘targets’), the temporal contribution of
each target being expressed by an interpolation function.
(2)
The language (or variety, etc.) which is the focus of a linguistic process
of change is known as the target language, e.g. the language into which one is
translating or interpreting, the language (or variety, etc.) being taught to foreign
learners, and so on.
(3)
In transformational grammar, the constituent affected by a trans-
formation is sometimes referred to as the target. For example, the target for
WH-movement can be a noun phrase, as in How many parcels will he send to
London?, a prepositional phrase, as in In which book did you read about it?,
or certain other kinds of phrase. A similar use is found in generative phono-
logy, where a rule can be triggered by one segment (the ‘trigger segment’) so as
to apply to another (the ‘target segment’).

tautosyllabic (adj.)
A term sometimes use in phonology to characterize a
pattern of segments which can be analysed as belonging to the same syllable;
contrasts with heterosyllabic, where the segments belong to different syllables.
For example, the question of VCV syllabiﬁcation can be discussed in terms of
whether it is the VC or CV sequences which are best analysed as tautosyllabic.
taxeme (n.)
A term introduced by Leonard Bloomﬁeld (see Bloomﬁeldian),
on analogy with the phoneme, to refer to a single minimal feature of gram-
matical arrangement. Examples of taxemes include word-order, concord,
the grammatical use of pitch, and the constituents of the actor–action–goal
taxeme
477

relationship. Combinations of taxemes, occurring as a conventional grammat-
ical unit, are tactic forms (see taxis). Taxemes are distinguished in this approach
from tagmemes, which are the smallest meaningful units of grammatical form.
taxis (n.)
A general term used in phonetics and linguistics to refer to the
systematic arrangements of units in linear sequence at any linguistic level.
The commonest terms based on this notion are: phonotactics, dealing with the
sequential arrangements of sounds; morphotactics with morphemes; and syn-
tactics with higher grammatical units than the morpheme. Some linguistic theor-
ies give this dimension of analysis particular importance (e.g. stratiﬁcational
grammar, where several levels of tactic organization are recognized, correspond-
ing to the strata set up by the theory, viz. ‘hypophonotactics’, ‘phonotactics’,
‘morphotactics’, ‘lexotactics’, ‘semotactics’ and ‘hypersemotactics’). See also
harmonic phonology.
taxonomic (adj.)
An application of the general sense of this term in biosyste-
matics, to refer to an approach to linguistic analysis and description which
is predominantly or exclusively concerned with classiﬁcation. The basis of
classiﬁcation may be diachronic, areal, typological, functional, etc., and
the entities being classiﬁed may be linguistic features, items, units, struc-
tures – or whole varieties, dialects or languages. The notion of taxonomy
has been fruitfully applied in many areas of linguistics (sociolinguistics, his-
torical linguistics, semantics and computational linguistics in particular).
The limitations of a taxonomic approach in linguistic analysis have, however,
been emphasized by generative linguists, who have criticized the overreliance
of structuralist (or ‘taxonomic’) linguistics on procedures of segmenta-
tion and classiﬁcation. In particular, the use of this label is intended to indicate
the inability of structural linguistics to provide a level of explanation in terms
of deep structure. Such phrases as ‘taxonomic phonology’, ‘taxonomic
syntax’, etc., when used in generative linguistics, invariably have a pejorative
implication.

telegraphic speech
A style of speech production in which function words
and inﬂectional endings tend to be omitted; earlier, also called telegrammatic
speech. The term derives from the written style used in the days when pay-by-
the-word telegrams were a common method of communication (Send cheque
Brighton), and is still used to describe any elliptical written style (e.g. in
newspaper headlines or want-ads); but in linguistics it is more commonly
encountered in relation to the sentence structures found in young children’s
speech (me kick ball) and the reduced range of grammatical expression typical
of one form of aphasia (see agrammatism).
telic (adj.)
A term used in the grammatical analysis of aspect, to refer to an
event where the activity has a clear terminal point. Telic verbs include fall, kick,
and make (something). These verbs contrast with atelic verbs, where the event
478
taxis

has no such natural end-point, as with play (in such a context as the children are
playing). The phenomenon is referred to as telicity.
template (n.) (1)
A term used in metrical phonology for an abstract tree
structure which deﬁnes the basic structural possibilities of syllables in a
language. For example, an inﬂuential formulation of English syllable structure
involves a hierarchical analysis into an onset + nucleus + coda, with the
latter two elements being grouped as a rhyme, and each element consisting of
two segments.
(2)
The term also has a central status in prosodic morphology, where it
refers to a ﬁxed phonological shape imposed on varying segmental material.
Templates are deﬁned in the grammar and realized in the derivation in terms
of the units in the prosodic hierarchy: mora, syllable, foot and prosodic
word. The templatic target may be imposed on any morphological base (e.g.
stem, word, afﬁx). In reduplicative constructions, for example, there might
be a preﬁx with a constant canonical shape (e.g. a heavy syllable), but a
varying segmental shape (depending on the base to which it is attached). The
template satisfaction condition states that the satisfaction of templatic con-
straints is obligatory and is determined by prosodic principles. This approach
contrasts with segmentalist theories of template form, such as in (1) above.
(3)
A general sense of the term (‘a pattern established as a norm against which
other patterns can be measured’) also has a number of applications in speciﬁc
linguistic or phonetic contexts. For example, in cognitive grammar, con-
nections between established patterns of neurological activity serve as templates
for categorizing expressions. In automatic speech recognition, templates are
the stored, labelled spectra (or the key features of spectra) against which an
analysis of the signal to be recognized is matched (template matching).
tempo (n.)
An application of the general sense of this term in phonetics and
phonology to refer to speed of speaking; alternatively known as rate. Con-
trasts in the tempo of utterance are analysed in suprasegmental phonetics
and phonology, along with pitch and loudness variation, as part of the overall
study of rhythm.
temporal dialect
see dialect
tenor (n.)
A term used in Hallidayan classiﬁcation of language varieties
(more fully tenor of discourse), referring to the relations among the participants
in a language activity, especially the level of formality they adopt (colloquial,
formal etc.). Alternative labels which have been proposed for this area are style
or manner of discourse.
tense (adj./n.) (1) (tns, TNS)
A category used in the grammatical descrip-
tion of verbs (along with aspect and mood), referring primarily to the way
the grammar marks the time at which the action denoted by the verb took
place. Traditionally, a distinction is made between past, present and future
tenses, often with further divisions (perfect, pluperfect, etc.). In linguistics,
the relationship between tense and time has been the subject of much study, and
it is now plain that there is no easily stateable relationship between the two.
tense
479

Tense forms (i.e. variations in the morphological form of the verb) can be
used to signal meanings other than temporal ones. In English, for example, the
past-tense form (e.g. I knew) may signal a tentative meaning, and not past time,
in some contexts (e.g. I wish I knew – that is, ‘know now’). Nor is there a
simple one-to-one relationship between tense forms and time: the present tense
in English may help to refer to future or past time, depending on context (e.g.
I’m going home tomorrow, Last week I’m walking down this street . . . (see
historic present)). Furthermore, if tenses are deﬁned as forms of the verb, it
becomes a matter of debate whether a language like English has a future tense
at all: constructions such as I will/shall go, according to many, are best ana-
lysed as involving modal auxiliary verbs, displaying a different grammatical
function (e.g. the expression of intention or obligation, which may often
involve futurity). English illustrates several such problems, as do other languages,
where tense forms, if they exist, regularly display analytic difﬁculties, because
of overlaps between tense and other verbal functions, such as aspect or mood.
Alternative terminology (e.g. ‘past’ v. ‘non-past’, ‘future’ v. ‘non-future’, ‘now’
v. ‘remote’) will often be needed. In later government-binding theory, the
term tense phrase (TP) is used for what was earlier called an inﬂection phrase
(IP), referring to a verb and its inﬂectional elements.
(2)
See tension.
tensed (adj.)
A term used in generative grammar to refer to a clause which
contains a verb that expresses a tense contrast (i.e. it is ﬁnite); it contrasts
with untensed. The tensed-sentence (S) condition in extended standard theory
states that a constituent cannot be moved out of or into a tensed sub-
ordinate clause. In government-binding theory, this condition has been
replaced by conditions A and B of binding theory.
tension (n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech sounds,
referring to the overall muscular effort used in producing a sound. The contrasts
are labelled variously, e.g. fortis v. lenis, tense v. lax. This contrast is viewed
as particularly important in distinctive feature theories of phonology, where
‘tense’ is one of the main features set up to handle variations in manner of
articulation. Tense sounds have been deﬁned both articulatorily and acous-
tically: they are sounds produced with a relatively strong muscular effort,
involving a greater movement of the (supraglottal) vocal tract away from
the position of rest (see fortis), and a relatively strong spread of acoustic
energy. The vowels [i] and [u], for example, would be [+tense]; [}] and [ä] would
be [−tense]. aspirated and long consonants (see length) would be [+tense].
The opposite term in Jakobson and Halle’s system (see Jakobsonian) is lax; in
Chomsky and Halle’s later system (see Chomskyan), the term non-tense is also
used: these are sounds produced with less muscular effort and movement, and
which are relatively short and indistinct, involving a relatively weak spread of
acoustic energy as in centralized vowels. Subglottal tension in Chomsky and
Halle’s system is handled by the feature heightened subglottal pressure.
term (adj./n.)
In relational grammar, one of the three basic relations recog-
nized by that theory: subject, direct object and indirect object. Term
relations are distinguished from non-term relations, such as chômeur.

tensed

terminal (adj.)
A term used in generative linguistics to identify certain
characteristics of the output of the syntactic component of the grammar. A
terminal element or terminal symbol refers to the units employed in the syntactic
representation of a sentence, after all the rules have been applied, viz. the
morphemes, formatives, features, such as the, -en, +, #, man. Terminal
symbols are distinguished from non-terminal (or ‘auxiliary’) elements, which are
used in formulating rules. The former are usually written in lower-case letters,
the latter in upper-case (e.g. NP, VP). A node which does not dominate other
categories is a terminal node. A string consisting of terminal elements is known as
a terminal string, i.e. the ﬁnal string generated by a phrase-structure grammar.

tertiary response
A term introduced into linguistics by Leonard Bloomﬁeld
(see Bloomﬁeldian) to refer to the views people display when their utterances
about language (their secondary responses) are themselves subjected to evalu-
ation. For example, people who say, ‘That dialect is ugly/primitive’, etc., are
making a secondary response; if this is disputed, then their attempt to explain
the basis of their statement (or, indeed, their general emotional reaction) would
constitute a tertiary response.
tertiary stress

tessitura (n.)
A term taken over by some phoneticians from musical termino-
logy and used to refer to the characteristic compass, or pitch range, of a person’s
voice, when speaking normally. People are often impressionistically classiﬁed in
this way (e.g. a ‘very high-pitched’ voice), as are languages.
test (n.)
see acceptability, commutation, minimal pair
text (n.)
A pre-theoretical term used in linguistics and phonetics to refer to
a stretch of language recorded for the purpose of analysis and description. What
is important to note is that texts may refer to collections of written or spoken
material (the latter having been transcribed in some way), e.g. conversation,
monologues, rituals, and so on. The term textual meaning is sometimes used in
semantics as part of a classiﬁcation of types of meaning, referring to those
factors affecting the interpretation of a sentence which derive from the rest of
text
481

the text in which the sentence occurs – as when, at a particular point in a play
or novel, a sentence or word appears whose signiﬁcance can only be appreciated
in the light of what has gone before.
The study of texts has become a deﬁning feature of a branch of linguistics
referred to (especially in Europe) as textlinguistics, and ‘text’ here has central
theoretical status. Texts are seen as language units which have a deﬁnable
communicative function, characterized by such principles as cohesion, coher-
ence and informativeness, which can be used to provide a formal deﬁnition of
what constitutes their identifying textuality or texture. On the basis of these
principles, texts are classiﬁed into text types, or genres, such as road signs, news
reports, poems, conversations, etc. The approach overlaps considerably with
that practised under the name of discourse analysis, and some linguists see
very little difference between them. But usage varies greatly. Some linguists
make a distinction between the notions of ‘text’, viewed as a physical ‘product’,
and ‘discourse’, viewed as a dynamic process of expression and interpretation,
whose function and mode of operation can be investigated using psycho-
linguistic and sociolinguistic, as well as linguistic, techniques. A similar
distinction sees ‘text’ as a notion which applies to surface structure, whereas
‘discourse’ applies to deep structure. From the opposite viewpoint, some
linguists have deﬁned ‘text’ as an abstract notion, ‘discourse’ being its realiza-
tion. Apart from these theoretical distinctions, there is also a tendency for texts
to be thought of as monologues, usually written, and often very short (e.g. no
through road), whereas discourses are often thought of as dialogues, usually
spoken and of greater length.

text-to-speech (adj.)
A term used in phonetics and computational linguistics
to refer to a system of speech synthesis which can transform a conventional
orthographic representation of language into its spoken equivalent. Such a
system begins by carrying out a morphological and phonological analysis
of an input text, taking into account such matters as regular v. irregular
forms. Letter-to-sound rules and other special features generate word-level
phonological representations, which are then transformed into a phonetic
representation (incorporating features of connected speech, including
sentence prosody). Synthesis takes place using a rule-based system, the output
being provided by a terminal analog synthesizer.
textuality, texture (n.)

T forms
An abbreviation used in sociolinguistics as part of the study of
terms of address in various languages. Based on the distinction between tu and
vous, the alternative forms of ‘you’ in French, and on similar contrasts in
many other languages (e.g. German du/Sie, Russian ty/vy), an opposition is set
up between familiar (T) and formal (V) second-person verb and pronoun
forms. Hypotheses are then developed concerning the system of formality in
use in the languages.
482
text deixis

that-clause
A term used in some models of English grammatical descrip-
tion to refer to a dependent declarative clause, introduced by that. The
main types are: subject clauses, e.g. that she wrote surprises me; object clauses,
e.g. she said that she wrote; appositional clauses, e.g. your view, that she’ll
write, is rubbish; subject complement clauses, e.g. the trouble is that it won’t
happen; adjectival complement clauses, e.g. I’m certain that he’ll go; and that-
relative clauses, e.g. The book that I sold . . . The that may be omitted in some
circumstances, e.g. he said he would go.
that-trace constraint/ﬁlter/phenomenon
A term in generative grammar, ori-
ginally in extended standard theory, used in connection with such con-
structions as *Who do you know that – saw Bill?, which involve extraction of
a subject from a clause introduced by a complementizer. In government-
binding theory, this phenomenon is accounted for by the empty category
principle.
thematic (adj.), thematization (n.)
see theme, thematic role
thematic role
In government-binding theory and the minimalist pro-
gramme, a term used for the role performed by each argument (i.e. subject or
complement) of a predicate, deﬁned with reference to a restricted universal
set of thematic functions (or thematic relations); also known as a theta role.
Thematic roles are usually interpreted in the same way as semantic cases in case
grammar, such as agent, patient, locative, source and goal. See also
semantic role.
theme (n.)
A term used in linguistics as part of an analysis of the structure
of sentences (their thematic structure): it refers, not to the subject-matter of
a sentence (its everyday meaning), but to the way speakers identify the relative
importance of their subject-matter, and is deﬁned as the ﬁrst major constitu-
ent of a sentence (seen here as a string of constituents). There is no necessary
correspondence with a functional grammatical element (though in English
theme and subject often coincide) e.g. The man is going, His hair I can’t stand,
Smith her name was, Under no condition will he . . . The process of moving an
element to the front of the sentence in this way (‘fronting’), to act as theme,
is known as thematization (sometimes topicalization) or thematic fronting.
Some linguists systematically distinguish this notion from other ways of analys-
ing the organization of the sentence structure of messages, such as the topic/
comment distinction, or an analysis in terms of information structure. See
semantic role.
In the Prague School approach to linguistics, theme is opposed to rheme,
producing a distinction similar to that of topic/comment, but interpreted with
reference to the theoretical framework of functional sentence perspective.
In this theory, the theme is deﬁned as the part of a sentence which adds least to
the advancing process of communication (it has the lowest degree of commun-
icative dynamism); in other words, it expresses relatively little (or no) extra
meaning, in addition to what has already been communicated. The rheme, by
contrast, carries the highest degree of communicative dynamism. Various transi-
tional expressions, neither ‘thematic’ nor ‘rhematic’, are also recognized.

theolinguistics (n.)
A term which has been used for the study of the relation-
ship between language and religious thought and practice, as illustrated by
ritual, sacred texts, preaching, doctrinal statements and private afﬁrmations of
belief. The distinctiveness of religious language usually takes the form of a
special set of varieties within a language, but special scripts and languages (as
with Ge’ez in the Ethiopian Church) may also be found, and considerable atten-
tion needs to be paid to philological enquiry, given the way much religious
language takes its origin from old texts and practices.

theta role

theta theory
One of the (sub-)theories of government-binding theory. Its
main principle is the theta-criterion, which requires that every argument is

argument. Its main role is to determine the positions to which NP-movement is
possible.

tier (n.)
A term in hierarchical models of phonology (see non-linear
phonology) for a level of phonological representation. For example, in
autosegmental phonology, parallel tiers of phonological segments are pro-
posed, each tier consisting of a string of segments, and representing a sequence
of articulatory gestures or acoustic transitions. In a tone language, for
instance, tones are represented on one tier, which speciﬁes features of tone
and nothing else; other (non-tonal) features are represented on a separate tier.
Features cannot appear on more than one tier, and thus tiers can be deﬁned by
the features found in them, as in the case of the phonemic tier, the skeletal
tier and the X-tier. The number of tiers varies between models. In particle
phonology, for example, there are ﬁve: syllabic, nucleus, timing, root and
particle tiers. Terminology varies greatly among different models, as in the case
484
theolinguistics

of the tier handling information about articulation, which has been called a
‘featural’, ‘gestural’, ‘melodic’, ‘segmental’ and ‘articulatory’ tier.
timbre (n.)
The attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which a listener can
judge the dissimilarity between sounds of otherwise identical pitch, loudness
and length; sometimes spelled tambre or tamber. Acoustically, the sensation of
timbre derives from the set of harmonics involved in the production of a tone.
The best examples can be found in the characteristic timbres, or ‘tonal qualities’,
of different instruments of the orchestra; but a similar set of timbres can be
established to distinguish between the frequency characteristics of individual
sounds (such as vowels, fricatives) or individual speakers (as one of the
features of voice quality). An alternative term, more widely used in the
context of segmental studies, is quality, as in vowel quality.
timing (adj./n.) (1)
This general term is applied in phonetics and psycho-
linguistics to the temporal constraints on the articulation and sequencing
of sounds in speech production. Timing phenomena are therefore of relevance
for an understanding of both segmental and suprasegmental phonetics and
phonology: timing is involved in the co-ordination of musculature required to
produce an individual sound, in the programming of phonotactic sequences,
and in such notions as rhythm and intonation.
(2)
The term is also found in some hierarchical models of phonology,
as the name of a tier of representation (though its application varies among
theories). In particle phonology, for example, the timing tier represents
syllable weight (moras). In autosegmental phonology it describes a
speciﬁc conception of the skeletal tier (see X-tier).
tip (n.)
The end-point of the tongue, also known as the apex; used in the
articulation of a few speech sounds, such as the trilled [r].
tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon
The everyday sense of this phrase is found in
psycholinguistics, where the phenomenon is subjected to experimental invest-
igation as part of a theory of speech production. It is shown that people
having a tip-of-the-tongue experience are able to recall certain general character-
istics of the word, e.g. the number of syllables it has, or its stress pattern;
also some phonetic segments are recalled more readily than others. These
results suggest that words vary in the accessibility of their phonological
representation in the brain, and that certain features of word structure are
stored independently of others. Lexical access is being triggered by a semantic
cue, but the access code that is used to retrieve the word contains certain pieces
of formal information that help us to ﬁnd it.

tone (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology to refer to the distinctive pitch
level of a syllable. In the study of intonation, a sequence of tones constitutes
a contour or tone unit. In Hallidayan analysis, the division of an utterance
into tone groups is called tonality. The most prominent tone in a tone unit may
be referred to as a nuclear tone. The organization of tonal structure within
a non-linear phonological model (the nature of tonal features and the
location of tonal linkage) is sometimes called tonal geometry.
The historical development of a tonal language from an atonal one is known
as tonogenesis. In many languages, the tone carried by a word is an essential
feature of the meaning of that word (lexical tone), e.g. in Beijing Mandarin
Chinese the word ma when pronounced in a level tone means ‘mother’, and in
a falling-rising tone means ‘horse’ – two out of four possible tone contrasts in
that language. Such languages, where word meanings or grammatical categor-
ies (such as tense) are dependent on pitch level, are known as tone languages.
The unit which carries the tone (e.g. syllable, mora) is called the tone-bearing
unit. Many languages of South-East Asia and Africa are tone languages, illus-
trating several types of tonal organization. In such languages, sequences of adjacent
tones may inﬂuence each other phonetically or phonologically, e.g. a word which
in isolation would have a low tone may be given a higher tone if a high-tone
word follows: such a phenomenon is sometimes called tone (or tonal) sandhi.
The study of the forms and uses of tone in language is sometimes called
tonology. The study of the phonetic properties of tone, in its most general sense,
is sometimes referred to as tonetics. In the emic tradition of study, contrastive
tones are classiﬁed as tonemes, and the study of such tones is known as tonemics.
Features of tone, such as ‘high’, ‘low’ and ‘mid’, are proposed by distinctive
feature theories of phonology. Tones which vary in pitch range are often
called ‘contour’, ‘kinetic’ or ‘dynamic’ tones; those which do not vary in range
are ‘static’ or ‘level’ tones. See also contour, polarity (2), tonic.
(2)
In acoustic phonetics, a sound with sufﬁcient regularity of vibration
to provide a sensation of pitch. Sounds which lack this regularity are charac-
terized as noise. A pure tone is produced by a waveform whose pattern of
vibration repeats itself at a constant rate; such tones are typically produced by
electronic sources or tuning forks. When two or more tones of different fre-
quencies combine, the result is a complex tone. Most sounds, including those of
speech, involve complex tones, with different periodic patterns.
(3)
In particle phonology, tonality refers to particles which represent
palatality and labiality, and is distinguished from aperture.

tone unit
A term used by some intonation analysts, particularly those
working within the British tradition, to refer to a distinctive sequence of pitches,
or tones, in an utterance; also called a tone group. The essential feature of a
tone unit is the nuclear tone, the most prominent tone in the sequence; and
this may be accompanied, depending on the length of the utterance, by other
components, such as the head (i.e. the sequence of syllables between the ﬁrst
stressed syllable and the nuclear tone), pre-head (i.e. unstressed syllables at the
very beginning of the tone unit) and tail (i.e. the syllables following the nuclear
tone). This terminology can be illustrated by the sentence the | man cbought a
| nèw | cclock |, where the sequence of pre-head/head/nucleus/tail is marked by
vertical lines. A tone unit usually corresponds to a clause or sentence, but
may be used on any grammatical unit, e.g. in an extremely irritated version of
the above sentence, there might be several tone units, as in the mán | bóught | a
néw | clòck |.
tongue (n.) (1)
From the phonetic point of view, the importance of the tongue
is that it is the organ of articulation most involved in the production of speech
sounds – all the vowels and the majority of the consonants (that is, excluding
those made at the lips and in the throat). Different parts of the tongue are
involved in articulating these sounds, and it has proved convenient to classify
sounds with reference to these areas. From front to back, it is usual to distin-
guish the tip (or apex), blade (or front), centre (or ‘top’), back (or dorsum)
and root. The groove running down the centre of the tongue is also signi-
ﬁcant, in that several sound contrasts can be made by altering its shape. Plotting
tongue movements is difﬁcult visually or kinaesthetically, but advances in
phonetic instrumentation, such as the electropalatograph, have enabled many
of these movements to be displayed with accuracy.
(2)
In Chomsky and Halle’s distinctive feature theory of phonology (see
Chomskyan), tongue-body features constitute one of the categories set up to
handle variations in place of articulation (cavity features). The placement
of the body of the tongue is characterized with reference to three features, all
seen as oppositions: high, low and back.
tongue-slip (n.)
The everyday sense of this phrase is found in phonetics and
psycholinguistics, where the phenomenon is studied as part of a theory of
speech production; also called a slip of the tongue. Such slips seem not to be
random; e.g. segments occurring initially in syllables seem to interfere only
with other syllable-initial segments. The suggestion is that tongue-slips are not
just errors of articulation, but are rather the results of incorrect neural
programming (‘slips of the brain’, as some would say). The analysis of these
errors motivates hypotheses about the properties of the neurolinguistic
control governing speech. Analogous notions have also been noted, as in ‘slips
of the pen’ and ‘ slips of the keyboard’. See access, anticipation.
tonic (adj./n.)
A term used by some intonation analysts, particularly those
working within the British tradition, to refer to the syllable in a tone unit
which carries maximal prominence, usually owing to a major pitch change.
The tonic syllable is also referred to as the ‘nuclear syllable’, or ‘nucleus’, in
this tradition. Most words in a tone unit can carry the tonic syllable, depending
tonic
487

on the meaning intended, although the usual position for this is at or towards
the end of a sequence. Compare the different emphases in The woman was
walking to town with The woman was walking to town and The woman was
walking to town. The change in tonicity gives the sentence different implications
(e.g. ‘The woman, not the man, was walking . . .’), an important aspect of
communication in conversation, where it draws attention especially to the new
information in a sentence.

topic (n.) (1)
A term used in semantics and grammar as part of an alternative
binary characterization of sentence structure to that traditionally found in
the subject/predicate distinction; the opposite term is comment. The topic
of a sentence is the entity (person, thing, etc.) about which something is said,
whereas the further statement made about this entity is the comment. The
usefulness of the distinction is that it enables general statements to be made
about the relationships between sentences which the subject/predicate distinc-
tion (along with other contrasts of this type) obscures. The topic often coincides
with the subject of a sentence (e.g. A visitor/ is coming to the door), but it need
not (e.g. There’s the driver/ who gave you a lift), and, even when it is a subject,
it need not come ﬁrst in a sentence (e.g. John Smith my name is). It is sometimes
referred to as the ‘psychological subject’. Some languages mark the topic of a
sentence using particles (e.g. Japanese, Samoan). The topic/comment contrast
is, however, sometimes difﬁcult to establish, owing to the effects of intonation
(which has a ‘competing’ information-signalling function), and in many
types of sentence the analysis is more problematic, such as in commands and
questions. Topicalization takes place when a constituent is moved to the
front of a sentence, so that it functions as topic, e.g. The answer I’ll give you in
a minute (see left dislocation).
(2)
The phrase topic sentence is used in traditional studies of the structure of
paragraphs, to refer to the sentence which introduces the paragraph’s theme.
Linguistic investigation of this and related notions is in its early stages, but text
analysis of paragraphs indicates that the semantic and syntactic complexities
of paragraph structure are much greater than this simple judgement suggests.

total accountability
A principle of linguistic analysis, introduced into struc-
turalist discussion in the 1940s, whereby everything that is stated at one
level of description is predictable from another. The principle is presented
with reference to the relationship between phonology and morphology: every
morph (and thus every phoneme) must be capable of being determined by the
morphemes and tagmemes of which an utterance is composed. Notions such
488

as empty and portmanteau morphs require special discussion in relation to
this principle.

tough movement
A term used in transformational grammar, referring to
a rule which involves moving a noun phrase out of the predicate of a
complement sentence. Tough is one of a class of adjectives (others being
hard, easy, simple, difﬁcult, etc.) which have been the focus of discussion ever
since Noam Chomsky’s discussion of pairs such as John is eager/easy to please.
Sentences such as The ball was easy for John to catch were said to be derived by
tough movement from the structure NP[it S[for John to catch the ball]S]NP was
easy, via a rule which extraposes the complement (it was easy for John to
catch the ball). The rule of tough movement took the non-subject noun phrase
from the extraposed complement (i.e. the ball) and substituted it for the initial
subject pronoun of the sentence as a whole (i.e. it). Other formulations of this
rule have been suggested, and the extent of the rule’s application has been
controversial.
trace (n.) (t)
A term introduced into transformational grammar of the
mid-1970s to refer to a formal means of marking the place a constituent
once held in a derivation, before it was moved to another position by a
transformational operation. The position from which the constituent was moved
is known as a trace (t marks its place in the representation), which is said to
be ‘bound’ by that constituent. The moved constituent and the empty node it
leaves behind are co-indexed. For example, in a rule which ‘raises’ the sub-
ject of an embedded clause to be the subject of the main clause, the trace
t marks the position of the embedded subject, e.g. it is certain [the man to come]
⇒ the man is certain t to come. (See also the THAT-trace constraint.) In
government-binding theory, a distinction is made between traces of noun
phrases moved by NP-movement (NP traces), as in passive and raising sen-
tences, and traces of categories moved by WH-movement (wh-traces), as in wh-
questions, relative clauses, etc. The former are anaphors and the latter are
variables. The distribution of traces is governed by the empty category
principle. Several arguments have been proposed to support a trace theory of
movement rules, e.g. that it facilitates the statement of the conditions which
affect the semantic interpretation of surface structures, and that it permits
a more principled account of the operation of syntactic rules. The extent of
the convention’s applicability (whether all moved constituents leave traces), and
the kinds of insight and problem which the theory raises, have been sources of
controversy. See also copying, ﬂoating trace.

traditional (adj.)
A term used in linguistics, often pejoratively, in relation
to grammar (traditional grammar), to refer to the set of attitudes, procedures
and prescriptions characteristic of the prelinguistic era of language study, and
especially of the European school grammars of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. The emphasis on such matters as correctness, linguistic purism,
traditional
489

literary excellence, the use of Latin models and the priority of the written
language characterizes this approach, and is in contrast with the concern of
linguistics for descriptive accuracy (appropriateness, criteria of analysis,
comprehensiveness, explicitness, etc.). On the other hand, several basic con-
cepts of contemporary grammatical analysis have their origins in pre-twentieth-
century linguistic traditions, such as the notions of hierarchy, universals
and word classiﬁcation. The term ‘traditional’, too, has been applied to the
major descriptive accounts of grammar in handbook form produced by several
North European grammarians in the early twentieth century (e.g. Otto Jespersen’s
Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles (1909–40)) and even, these
days, to the early period of generative grammar! The pejorative use of the term,
therefore, needs to be invoked with caution.
transcription (n.)
A method of writing down speech sounds in a systematic
and consistent way – also known as a ‘notation’ or ‘script’. Two main kinds of
transcription are recognized: phonetic and phonemic. Square brackets enclose
phonetic transcription (notation/script); oblique lines enclose phonemic tran-
scription (notation/script). In the former, sounds are symbolized on the basis
of their articulatory/auditory identity, regardless of their function in a
language (sometimes called an impressionistic transcription). In the latter,
the only units to be symbolized are those which have a linguistic function, i.e.
the phonemes. An allophonic transcription adds functional phonetic details.
A phonemic transcription looks simplest of all, as in this only the units which
account for differences of meaning will be represented, e.g. /pin/, /pen/, /pæn/.
In a phonetic transcription, on the other hand, the aim is not to judge the
functional signiﬁcance of sounds, in the context of some language, but to ident-
ify the sounds as such.
A phonetic transcription of the English word pen, for example, might be [ph*n]:
this indicates some quite subtle features of pronunciation, such as the aspiration
following the plosive, and the slight nasalization of the vowel – features
which are not phonemes in their own right. If necessary, such a transcription could
be made more detailed still, to incorporate any other articulatory or auditory
features found in the pronunciation. Phonetic transcriptions which are relatively
detailed are called narrow transcriptions; those which are less detailed are called
broad transcriptions. In the broadest possible transcription, only those phonetic
segments would be notated which correspond to the functionally important
units in the language – in other words, it would be equivalent to a phonemic
transcription, and some phoneticians do use ‘broad’ in the sense of ‘phonemic’.
But in principle it is important to appreciate that the two transcriptions of [pen]
and /pen/ refer to very different entities: the ﬁrst is a broad phonetic transcrip-
tion, representing a sequence of concrete, physical articulations; the second is a
phonemic transcription, representing a sequence of abstract, functional units,
and reﬂecting a particular theoretical point of view.
It is also important to remember that there are several possible ways of
transcribing sounds phonemically, depending on the analyst’s views as to what
the salient contrasting features are. The contrast between seat and sit, for example,
might be shown as /sipt/ v. /sit/, or as /sit/ v. /s}t/: in the former case, the trans-
cription indicates that the contrast between these words is due to the different
length of the vowels; in the latter case, the transcription suggests that it is not
490
transcription

length but the quality of the vowels which differentiates the words, /s}t/ using
a more open vowel than /sit/. It would also be possible to have a third view,
/sipt/ v. /s}t/, where both length and quality would be considered relevant. All
these transcriptions will be found.
In any transcription (whether phonetic or phonemic), each distinguishable
sound is given its own ‘symbol’. The whole range of available phonetic symbols
is known as a ‘phonetic alphabet’. The most widely used such alphabet is the
international phonetic alphabet.
Phonetic symbols are often the same as a letter of the alphabet, e.g. [b] as in
bit, [k] as in kettle, but many new symbols have had to be invented to cope with
the range of sounds heard in speech, e.g. [à] for the sh sound in ship, [θ] for the
th sound in thin. Most of the vowel sounds have had to be given a new symbol,
to avoid overloading the ﬁve traditional vowel letters of the alphabet, and the
generally ‘alien’ appearance of a phonetic transcription is largely due to this
(see the range used in the cardinal vowel system, for example). See p. xxv of
this dictionary.
transfer (n.) (1)
In foreign-language learning, the inﬂuence of a person’s ﬁrst
language on the language being acquired. Transfer effects form part of a person’s
interlanguage.
(2)
In semantics, any process which enables the same linguistic expression to
refer to different sorts of things. The notion includes various kinds of ﬁgurative
language (such as metaphor).

transform (n.)
see transformation
transformation (n.) (T)
A formal linguistic operation which enables two
levels of structural representation to be placed in correspondence. A trans-
formational rule (T rule, transformation or transform) consists of a sequence
of symbols which is rewritten as another sequence, according to certain con-
ventions. The ‘input’ to the rule is the structural description (‘structural
analysis’ or ‘structure index’), which deﬁnes the class of phrase-markers to
which the rule can apply. The rule then operates a structural change on
this input, by performing one or more of several basic operations. movement
(reordering or permutation) transformations modify an input structure by
reordering the elements it contains. When this operation is seen as one of
moving elements to adjoining positions in a phrase-marker, it is known as
adjunction. insertion transformations add new structural elements to the
input structure (as in element-copying, or the insertion of by in the passive
transformation below). deletion transformations eliminate elements from the
input structure. There is a certain amount of variation in the names given to
these operations, and opinions differ concerning their status as fundamental
operations within the theory.
One of the earliest illustrations of the operation of a transformational rule
was the one which converted active sentences into passive ones, which can be
formulated as follows:
NP1−Aux−V−NP2 ⇒ NP2−Aux+be+en−V−by+NP1
transformation
491

(where be is a form of the verb to be, and en represents the past-participle
ending of the lexical verb). The rule is said to ‘operate’ on the ﬁrst, underlying
phrase-marker, converting it into a second, ‘derived’, phrase-marker. The string
produced by the derived phrase-marker may then serve as the underlying string
for further transformations, as the analysis of the sentence proceeds. The sequ-
ence of phrase-markers assigned to a sentence constitutes its transformational
derivation or transformational history.
A grammar which operates using this notion is a transformational grammar
(TG) or transformational generative grammar (TGG). This type of grammar
was ﬁrst discussed by Noam Chomsky in Syntactic Structures (1957) as an illus-
tration of a generative device more powerful than ﬁnite-state grammars
or phrase-structure grammars. In this view, very many sentence types can
be economically derived by supplementing the constituent analysis rules of
phrase-structure grammars with rules for transforming one sentence into an-
other. The rule of passivization above, for instance, is claimed to be a procedure
both simpler and intuitively more satisfactory than generating active and
passive sentences separately in the same grammar. The arguments were per-
suasive, and as a result transformational grammars became the most inﬂuential
type in the development of generative grammatical theory: indeed, the ﬁeld as
a whole for a time came to be variously known as ‘generative grammar’, ‘trans-
formational-generative grammar’ (or simply ‘TG’).
Several models of transformational grammar have been presented since its ﬁrst
outline. The standard model, as presented by Chomsky in Aspects of the Theory
of Syntax (1965), consists of three components: (a) a syntactic component,
comprising a basic set of phrase-structure rules (sometimes called the base com-
ponent), which together with lexical information provides the deep-structure
information about sentences, and a set of transformational rules for generating
surface structures; (b) a phonological component, which converts strings
of syntactic elements into pronounceable utterance; and (c) a semantic com-
ponent, which provides a representation of the meaning of the lexical items
to be used in the sentence. The ways in which these components should be inter-
related (especially the relationships between semantics and syntax) have proved
to be a source of continuing controversy, since the appearance of Aspects, and
alternative models of analysis have developed (compare especially the distinction
between generative and interpretive semantics).
As a result of these developments, the status and classiﬁcation of transforma-
tions varied a great deal in the 1960s and 1970s. A distinction introduced early
on is that between optional and obligatory transformations, the former
referring to a rule which may apply at a given stage in a derivation, the latter to
a rule which must apply, if a well-formed sentence is to result. On the other
hand, the classiﬁcation and terminology of transformations in Syntactic Structures
is different in many respects from that encountered in Aspects. In the former,
two types of transformation are recognized: singulary (or single-base), where
the rule operates on only one terminal string; and generalized (or double-
base), where the rule combines two or more terminal strings, as in conjoining
and embedding transformations (which handle co-ordination and sub-
ordination respectively). In Aspects, however, other distinctions are intro-
duced, some of which replace those found in the former book. Of particular
importance is a distinction drawn in one of the models outlined in Aspects
492
transformation

between lexical and ‘non-lexical’ transformations: the former transform pre-
lexical structures into deep structures containing complex symbols; the latter
transform deep structures into surface structures. A further development is
the much increased generality of transformations, culminating in the rule
‘move alpha’ – essentially a licence to move anything anywhere, except that
the movement must be an instance of either substitution or adjunction, and
must obey subjacency. Later developments take place within the minimalist
programme.
The theoretical status of transformations in generative linguistics is still a matter
of debate, e.g. how to restrict the power of transformations, or whether all
transformations need to be meaning-preserving (see the Katz–Postal hypothesis).
Moreover, transformational grammars have come to be seen in contrast to
non-transformational grammars, such as relational grammar, lexical func-
tional grammar and generalized phrase-structure grammar. The poten-
tial fruitfulness of the notion, however, continues to be explored. See also cycle,
reordering (1).

transition (n.) (1)
A term used in phonology to refer to the way adjacent
sounds are linked. There are many ways in which the relationships between
successive articulations may be described (see glide (1), liaison): one
general classiﬁcation which has been suggested distinguishes between close
transitions and open transitions, similar to the distinction between close and
open juncture. Close transitions refer to those articulations where there is
an articulatory continuity between successive sounds; in open transition, by
contrast, there is a break in the continuity of the articulation. The distinction
can be seen in the s–s sequences heard in this sort and this assortment, where the
former illustrates a close and the latter an open transition.
(2)
The term is also used in acoustic phonetics for the acoustic change
which takes place as the vocal organs move to and from the articulatory posi-
tions of consonants, especially plosives. The transitional features, or tran-
sients, can be clearly seen on a spectrogram, by the way the formants of the
adjacent vowels are bent upwards or downwards, depending on which conson-
ant is articulated.

transition network grammar
A label given to a type of network grammar
which shows possible surface-structure patterns using diagrammatic models.
When supplemented by features which enable it to handle such matters as
agreement and order displacement, it is known as an augmented transition
network (ATN) grammar. See also automation.

493

transitivity (n.)
A category used in the grammatical analysis of clause/
sentence constructions, with particular reference to the verb’s relationship
to dependent elements of structure. The main members of this category are
transitive (tr, trans), referring to a verb which can take a direct object (as in he
saw the dog), and intransitive (intr, intrans), where it cannot (as in *he arrived
a ball). Many verbs can have both a transitive and an intransitive use (cf. we
went a mile v. we went), and in some languages this distinction is marked
morphologically. More complex relationships between a verb and the
elements dependent upon it are usually classiﬁed separately. For example, verbs
which take two objects are sometimes called ditransitive (as opposed to
monotransitive), as in she gave me a pencil. There are also several uses of verbs
which are marginal to one or other of these categories, as in pseudo-intransitive
constructions (e.g. the eggs are selling well, where an agent is assumed –
‘someone is selling the eggs’ – unlike normal intransitive constructions, which
do not have an agent transform: we went, but not *someone went us). Some
grammarians also talk about (in)transitive prepositions. For example, with is
a transitive preposition, as it must always be accompanied by a noun phrase
complement (object), and along can be transitive or intransitive: cf. She arrived
with a dog v. *She arrived with and She was walking along the river v. She was
walking along.
translatology (n.)
In applied linguistics, the study of translation, subsuming
both interpretation of oral discourse and translation (in a narrow sense)
of written discourse. The process of transferring an oral message from one
language to another at the moment of utterance is variously known as simul-
taneous interpretation or simultaneous translation. The oral transference of a
written message from one language to another is sight translation.
transliteration (n.)
In the study of writing systems, the conversion of one writ-
ing system into another. Each character of the source language is given an
equivalent character in the target language – as in the representation of Russian
names in English. Transliteration is commonly carried out for the names
of people, places, institutions and inventions. Several systems may exist for a
single language. Transliteration needs to be distinguished from transcription,
in which the sounds of the source word are conveyed by letters in the target
language.
transparent (adj.)
A term used in several areas of linguistics to refer to an
analysis which presents the relevant facts in a direct and perspicuous manner. In
generative phonology, for example, transparency refers to the extent to
which the applications of a given rule to a given form can be seen in the
phonetic output at the end of the derivation. Non-transparent rules are
referred to as opaque. The term has also developed special senses in semantics
and generative syntax. See also opaque.
transplanar locality
see locality (1)
tree (n.) (1)
A two-dimensional diagram used in generative grammar as
a convenient means of displaying the internal hierarchical structure of
494
transitivity

sentences as generated by a set of rules. The ‘root’ of the tree diagram is at
the top of the diagram, consisting of the initial symbol S. From this topmost
point, or node, branches descend corresponding to the categories speciﬁed
by the rules (e.g. NP, VP). The internal relationships of parts of the tree are
described using ‘family tree’ terminology: if two categories both derive from a
single node, they are said to be ‘sisters’, and ‘daughters’ of the ‘mother node’
from which they derive. A subsection of a tree diagram, isolated for purposes of
discussion, is referred to as a subtree, as in the enclosed area within the diagram
below. The internal organization of a tree is sometimes referred to as tree
geometry. In generalized phrase-structure grammar, the term local tree
refers to a tree of depth one, i.e. a tree in which every node other than the root
is a daughter of the root. The S–NP–VP subtree in the diagram below would be
a local tree, in this context. In procedural grammar, a structure tree or parse
tree is the result of applying the analytical procedures to a text. In computer
corpus research, a parsed corpus is known as a treebank. See also dependency

tree-adjoining grammar (TAG)
A type of formal grammar which recognizes
trees as primitive elements (elementary trees), combining these into larger
structures; also called tree-adjunction grammar. Elementary trees are of two
kinds: initial trees, which contain the basic phrasal elements of simple sen-
tences, without any recursion; and auxiliary trees, which represent recursive
structures. The tag formalism makes use of the operations of substitution
(in which a root node from one tree is merged with a non-terminal node in
another, to produce a new tree) and adjunction (in which an auxiliary tree is
attached to a non-terminal node in an initial tree). TAGs were devised by US
computer scientist Aravind K. Joshi (b. 1929) and colleagues. They are weakly
equivalent to context-free grammars.

triadic
triadic (adj.)
A term used to characterize a theory of meaning which postulates
that there is an indirect relationship between linguistic forms and the entities,
states of affairs, etc., to which they refer (i.e. referents). Instead of a direct two-
way relationship (a dualist theory), a third step is proposed, corresponding
to the mental concept or sense of the linguistic form. The best-known triadic
model is the ‘semantic triangle’ of C. K. Ogden (1889–1957) and I. A. Richards
(1893–1979), presented in their book The Meaning of Meaning in 1923.

trigraph (n.)
In the study of reading and spelling, a sequence of three written
symbols representing one speech sound. Examples include manoeuvre, where
the oeu represents /up/, and French eau ‘water’, pronounced /op/.
trill (n.)
A term in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds on the
basis of their manner of articulation: also known as a trilled consonant, or
a roll, ‘trill’ refers to any sound made by the rapid tapping of one organ of
articulation against another. (vocal-fold vibration is not included in such a
deﬁnition.) Several accents of English use the trilled r, as in Welsh and Scots.
French and German are examples of languages which have a uvular trill. The
trill may also be accompanied by audible friction, and would then be called a
‘fricative trill’. bilabial trills are also possible, as when one makes a ‘freezing’
noise, brrr [B], or imitates a car engine.
tripartite (adj.)
A term referring to the three-part structure assumed to underlie
quantiﬁcational sentences in ﬁle change semantics and related theories.
The three parts of a tripartite structure are a quantiﬁer, a restriction clause
limiting the class of entities which are quantiﬁed over, and a nuclear scope.

where there are two noticeable changes in quality during a syllable, as in a

phonetically unclear.
trisyllable (n.)
A term used in phonetics and phonology to refer to a unit,
typically a word, consisting of three syllables, such as consequence and
happily; it contrasts with monosyllable and disyllable. A trisyllabic form is
distinguished from monosyllabic and disyllabic forms.

trochee (n.)
A traditional term in metrics for a unit of poetic rhythm com-
prising a single pair of stressed + unstressed syllables (as in David); also called
a trochaic foot. In metrical phonology, the notion is used as an informal
name for bounded left-dominant feet, which display this rhythmical struc-
ture. See also iamb.
troponymy (n.)
In semantics, a term used for a type of entailment found in
verbs: the activity referred to by a troponym and its superordinate are always
temporally co-extensive. An example is the relationship between limp and walk.
By contrast, snore is not a troponym of sleep.

truncation (n.)
A term sometimes used in phonology to refer to a process
of word shortening which is phonologically predictable. Certain types of
hypocoristic (pet-name), for example, have been shown to be truncated in a
regular way. The process has attracted particular attention in prosodic mor-
phology, where it is used to illustrate such processes as template-mapping
and prosodic circumscription.
truth-conditional semantics
An approach to semantics which maintains that
meaning can be deﬁned in terms of the conditions in the real world under
which a sentence may be used to make a true statement. It can be distinguished
from approaches which deﬁne meaning in terms of the conditions on the use of
sentences in communication, such as the function of the sentence in terms of
speech acts, or the speaker’s beliefs about the sentence (see pragmatics).
truth conditions
A term used in logic and semantics for the conditions under
which a sentence is true. For example, Snow is white is true if and only if snow
is white.
truth functional
A term used in logic and semantics to refer to connectives
or other operators which are analysed as denoting truth functions – that is,

functions which map ordered n-tuples of truth values onto truth values.
conjunction, disjunction and the material conditional and biconditional
are all examples of truth functional connectives.
truth value
A term used in logic and semantics for the status of a sentence
as true or false. The numbers 1 and 0 are sometimes used to represent the values
‘true’ and ‘false’, respectively. Some theories admit additional truth values.
Turing machine
see automaton
turn (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics as part of the study of conversa-
tional structure: conversation is seen as a sequence of conversational turns, in
which the contribution of each participant is seen as part of a co-ordinated and
rule-governed behavioural interaction. Some of the rules governing turn-taking
are obvious (e.g. that only one person should talk at a time); others are less easy
to discover (e.g. the rules which decide who should speak next in a group
discussion). How children learn the conventions governing turn-taking is an
issue which has attracted considerable interest in language acquisition.
turn-taking (n.)
see turn
type (n.) (1)
A notion developed in mathematical logic and used as part of
the conceptual apparatus underlying formal semantics (notably, in lambda
calculus). A type-theoretic approach offers a mathematical perspective for the
categorial syntax of natural language, using the notion of a hierarchy of
types as a framework for semantic structure (as in Montague grammar). Basic
(or primitive) types (e.g. ‘entity’, ‘truth value’, ‘state’) are distinguished from
derived or complex types (e.g. functional types: an example is (a, b), i.e. all
functions taking arguments in the a domain apply to values in the b domain).
Types are used in several models of lexical representation (notably, ‘typed
feature structures’) to refer to a superordinate category. The types are organ-
ized as a lattice framework, with the most general type represented at the
top and inconsistency indicated at the bottom. Similarities in lattices specify
compatibility between types. Subtypes inherit all the properties of all their
supertypes: for example, in a typed feature structure hierarchy, the subtype
sausages under the type food (‘sausages are a type of food’) means that sausages
has all the properties speciﬁed by the type constraints on food, with some
further properties of its own.

In lexical study, a term used as part of a measure of lexical density. The
type/token ratio is the ratio of the total number of different words (types) to the
total number of words (tokens) in a sample of text.

complex types, based on denotations of simpler types, are known as type-raising
rules. Rules which assign derived denotations of relatively simple types, based
on denotations of more complex types, are known as type-lowering rules. In

derived syntactic categories.

typological linguistics
A branch of linguistics which studies the structural
similarities between languages, regardless of their history, as part of an attempt
to establish a satisfactory classiﬁcation, or typology, of languages. Typological
comparison is thus distinguished from the historical comparison of languages –
the province of comparative philology and historical linguistics – and
its groupings may not coincide with those set up by the historical method. For
example, in respect of the paucity of inﬂectional endings, English is closer
to Chinese than it is to Latin. One typological classiﬁcation, proposed by the
German linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1768–1835) in the early nineteenth
century, established three main groups of languages on structural grounds: iso-
lating, agglutinative and fusional; a fourth category, polysynthetic, has
sometimes been suggested. The morphological orientation of this approach
is, however, only one aspect of typological analysis, which can operate at all
linguistic levels (e.g. a phonological typology in terms of consonant/vowel
inventories or systems, syllable structure, or suprasegmental patterns – as
illustrated in such notions as ‘tone language’ or ‘click language’). When one
considers the many possible criteria of typological comparison, it is plain that
no simple classiﬁcation is likely to emerge, and that differences between languages
are not clear-cut, but matters of degree.

U
ultimate constituent (UC)
A term used in structuralist grammatical analysis
to refer to the irreducible elements which are the result of an immediate-
constituent analysis. For example, in the sentence The girls stopped the bus,
the ultimate constituents would be the+girl+s+stop+ed+the+bus.
ultraﬁlter (n.)
A term used in abstract algebra, and adapted in generalized
quantiﬁer theory for the set of sets containing some particular individual.
Such sets serve in this theory as the denotations of proper names and similar
expressions.
umlaut (n.)
In historical linguistics and philology, a term describing a
sound change in which a sound is inﬂuenced by the vowel in the following
syllable. An example is Germanic *gosi, where the ﬁnal vowel caused a change
of /op/ to /ip/, resulting in modern English geese.

unaccusative (adj./n.)
A term used, especially in relational grammar, for
intransitive verbs whose subjects originate as objects. Break in The vase
broke is such a verb, the vase being understood in the same way as it is in John
broke the vase, where it is an object. Unaccusative verbs are also known as
ergative verbs.
unanalysable (adj.)

unary (adj.)
A term used in some approaches to phonology (e.g. depend-
ency phonology, particle phonology), characterizing the view that seg-
ments can be represented as single elements (e.g. [round], [front]), as opposed
to binary oppositions. The term is given special status in unary component
theory.

unbounded dependency
A term used in some theories of grammar (such as
generalized phrase-structure grammar) to refer to a construction in
which a syntactic relation holds between two constituents such that there
is no restriction on the structural distance between them (e.g. a restriction which
would require that both be constituents of the same clause); also called a long-
distance clause. In English, cleft sentences, topicalization, WH-questions
and relative clauses have been proposed as examples of constructions which
involve this kind of dependency; for instance, a wh-constituent may occur at
the beginning of a main clause, while the construction with which it is con-
nected may be one, two or more clauses away, as in What has John done?/What
do they think John has done?/What do they think we have said John has done?,
etc. In government-binding theory, unbounded dependencies are analysed in
terms of movement. In GPSG, use is made of the feature slash. The term is
increasingly used outside the generative context.

underextension (n.)
A term used in language acquisition studies to refer to
one type of relationship between adult and child meaning, as expressed in
lexical items. In underextension the child’s lexical item has a narrower range
of application than the equivalent term in adult language, e.g. when cat is used
to refer to one speciﬁc cat or one type of cat, and not all.
underlying (adj.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to an abstract level of
representation of a sentence postulated in order to explain the patterns
encountered in the empirical data of a language. The notion of underlying
representation (UR) or underlying forms is central to generative grammar,
where a stage of underlying structure is recognized in the derivation of sen-
tences. In early transformational grammar, the underlying phrase-marker
refers to the structural description of a sentence which is the result of the
phrase-structure rules; this underlying string then acts as the input to the
transformational rules, which thereby produce ‘derived’ phrase-markers. Later,
the term deep structure came to be used as a speciﬁc conception of underlying
structure, in the context of Aspects of the Theory of Syntax, from which sur-
face structures are transformationally derived. In government-binding
theory, the term D-structure is used. The extent to which the various underly-
ing representations of sentences have psychological reality has been and remains
controversial.
underspeciﬁcation (n.) (1)
In feature theories of phonology, a term charac-
terizing various approaches which see it as desirable that information should be
omitted from underlying phonological representations. The representations
should be minimally speciﬁed, or underspeciﬁed. There is a departure from the
concept of ‘full’ speciﬁcation present in early generative phonology: the view
that the output of the phonological component must contain fully speciﬁed
underspeciﬁcation
501

binary feature matrices. Underspeciﬁcation theory is concerned with the extent
to which feature distinctions should appear in a phonological representation, not
as a binary choice of [+feature] v. [−feature], but as a choice between [+feature]
and no marking at all. It therefore looks in particular at which feature values
are predictable and may thus be left unspeciﬁed in a representation without
harming the surface form.
The approach is chieﬂy associated with lexical phonology, but there are
several underspeciﬁcation models, which vary over their conceptions of minimality.
In restricted or contrastive underspeciﬁcation, only redundant features are
lexically unspeciﬁed (e.g. in English, voicing would be speciﬁed for obstruents,
where it is contrastive, but not for sonorants, where it is redundant). The
approach limits the degree of underspeciﬁcation in lexical forms by omitting
only those feature values which are predictable on the basis of universal co-
occurrence conditions. No other features may be underspeciﬁed. This contrasts
with radical underspeciﬁcation (RU), which allows only one value to be speci-
ﬁed in any given context in a representation. Moreover, such speciﬁcations are
needed only when a rule would otherwise assign the wrong value to a feature.
This approach omits from underlying representations not only the feature values
which are predictable from co-occurrence conditions but also those which are
predictable from context-free markedness statements. Default rules assign
unmarked values. Other positions in underspeciﬁcation theory are also possible,
e.g. that the unmarked value is never introduced, so that all features are effect-
ively single-valued (privative).
(2)
The term is also used in relation to other levels of language for any model
which does not require the speciﬁcation of all the factors potentially involved in
an analysis. In semantics, for example, there are approaches to formaliza-
tion which do not completely specify all features of logical structure (e.g. in
representing scope ambiguities).

uniﬁcation (n.)
A term used for the central operation within a number of
recent grammatical theories, which have been termed ‘uniﬁcation-based ap-
proaches to grammar’. Uniﬁcation is the merging of two descriptions to form
a more speciﬁc description which is consistent with both. For example, a noun
in description D1 might be speciﬁed for countability but not for case, whereas
in D2 the same noun might be speciﬁed for case but not countability. The two
descriptions could then be uniﬁed, and any operations which could be carried
out on either of the original descriptions could then be performed on the uniﬁed
description. The approach has advantages for grammatical analysis, in that it
allows a grammar to specify constraints on the language without having to
502
unfooted

state the order in which the constraints are applied: regardless of the number of
uniﬁcations it takes to fully specify a category, these uniﬁcations can be applied
in any order. The approach thus has advantages for computational parsing, in
that it allows a parser to work with partial descriptions, gradually accumulating
information about a grammatical category as it deals with different entries in
the lexicon.
uniﬁed features
A term used to characterize models of non-linear phono-
logy which integrate consonantal and vowel place features in a single frame-
work. In this approach, for example, labial and coronal articulations are
brought together into a single coronal tier. However, consonants and vowels
retain their identity, in that place features of consonants are immediately
dominated by the consonantal place node, and vowels by the vocalic place
node. Thus the relation of [labial] in a consonant to C-place deﬁnes a different
plane from that of [labial] in a vowel to V-place.
uniformitarian principle
The application in historical linguistics and socio-
linguistics of a notion used in history and geology, as a guideline for recon-
structing language in its social context. The principle advocates that the
linguistic forces which cause variation today are similar to those which have
operated in the past; it is therefore permissible to apply reasoning based on
modern observations to the analysis of earlier states of a language.
uniformity of theta-role assignment hypothesis (UTAH)
A constraint proposed
in government-binding theory and inherited by the minimalist programme
which requires identical thematic role relationships to be represented ident-
ically in underlying structure. The strong version of UTAH states that a
thematic role (e.g. theme) always occupies the same position (e.g. as sister of V)
in a tree. The weak version (also called relative UTAH) states that thematic
roles must appear in relative hierarchical order in a tree (e.g. agent > theme >
goal), but does not say where they must appear.

unit (n.)
In a general, pre-theoretical sense, this term is often used in lin-
guistics and phonetics to refer to any entity which constitutes the focus of
an enquiry. In Hallidayan linguistics, however, the term has a special status,
referring to one of the four main categories recognized by that theory (the
others being structure, class and system). The unit is the stretch of lan-
guage that carries grammatical patterns, and within which grammatical choices
are made. For example, the unit sentence consists of one or more instances of
the unit clause, and so on (see rank). In some grammatical descriptions, the
term unit noun is preferred to countable noun. See cognitive grammar.

universal (adj./n.)
A term used in linguistics, and especially in generative
grammar, referring to a property claimed to be common for all languages, to
demonstrate the validity of which is a main goal of linguistic theory. Universal
grammar (UG) is the term used to identify the main aim of those who hold that
the ultimate purpose of linguistics is to specify precisely the possible form of a
human grammar – and especially the restrictions on the form such grammars
can take. In their broadest sense, then, language universals are equivalent to the
general design features of human language identiﬁed by some linguists under
such headings as duality, creativity, reﬂexiveness and displacement. In
this sense, universals provide a theory of the human language faculty – those
properties of language which are biologically necessary – which is thought to be
an important step in the task of understanding human intellectual capacities.
In the early generative literature, two main types of universal are recognized.
Formal universals are the necessary conditions which have to be imposed on the
construction of grammars in order for them to be able to operate. They include
such notions as the number of components, types of rules, ordering conven-
tions (e.g. cycles), types of transformations, and so on. Substantive universals,
on the other hand, are the primitive elements in a grammar, required for the
analysis of linguistic data, e.g. NP, VP, [+grave], [+abstract]. Depending on the
component of the grammar in which they occur, universals are referred to as
‘phonological universals’, ‘semantic universals’ (cf. ‘universal semantics’),
‘syntactic universals’, etc. Some of these categories may actually be found in
every language, but it is not crucial to the notion of substantive universal that
they should be. All that is required is that they be constructs which need to be
deﬁned by linguistic theory to enable cross-language generalizations to be made,
i.e. they are not terms established for the analysis of just one language, but
are capable of general application. The universal base hypothesis in generative
linguistics states that all languages can be generated by using the same set of
basic rules – though whether these are seen as rules of the base syntactic
component or as a set of semantic formation rules depends on the theory
employed (see standard theory and generative semantics).
Other types of linguistic universal have been suggested. Quantitative studies
have introduced the notion of statistical universals, i.e. constants of a statistical
kind, such as a ratio of use between different structures. Implicational universals
are generalized statements of the form ‘if X, then Y’, e.g. if a language has a
word-order of a certain type, it will also have a verb structure of a certain
type. Absolute universals are properties which all languages share; there are no
exceptions. Relative universals are general tendencies in language; there may be
principled exceptions.

unmarked (adj.)
A term used in linguistics in various senses, to refer to a
property of language which is more neutral, common, expected or general than
a corresponding property, which is said to be marked. Unmarked values in
some approaches are also often called ‘default’ values, and can be handled by
conditions that a category must meet if it can, but need not meet if it cannot,
e.g. the default value for case might be accusative. The current use of the term
in core grammar should be noted, as should its use in recent phonological
theory (e.g. underspeciﬁcation theory).

usage (n.)
The collective term for the speech and writing habits of a community,
especially as they are presented descriptively with information about pre-
ferences for alternative linguistic forms. linguists emphasize the importance
of describing the facts of usage as a control on the claims made by grammars,
and contrast this emphasis with the prescriptive attitudes of traditional
grammar, whose rules often bore no relationship to what people actually did
with their language. The many ‘levels of usage’ which descriptive investiga-
tions encounter can be formally taken into account in several ways, such as by
adding usage labels (as in dictionary entries, e.g. ‘slang’, ‘nautical’), or by the
use of statistical statements about preferences, or (in generative contexts) by
the notion of variable rules.
UTAH

utterance (n.)
A term used in linguistics and phonetics to refer to a stretch
of speech about which no assumptions have been made in terms of linguistic
theory (as opposed to the notion of sentence, which receives its deﬁnition from
a theory of grammar). In principle, it is a physically deﬁnable, behavioural unit,
capable of deﬁnition in everyday terms. One commonly used deﬁnition refers to
a ‘stretch of speech preceded and followed by silence or a change of speaker’.

505

But it has proved very difﬁcult to construct a satisfactory deﬁnition. The deﬁni-
tion just given, for instance, applies equally to a one-word response and a
sermon, and attempts have been made to produce a more restricted deﬁnition,
using such features as pause, rhythm, breath patterns, pitch movement, etc.
The analogous term in the study of writing is text. See also context.
uvular (adj.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made by the
back of the tongue against the uvula, the ﬂeshy appendage which hangs at the
back of the soft palate. The r of standard French is uvular, and this quality
may be heard in some regional dialects of English, especially in the north-east
of England. It is transcribed as [r]. Uvular plosive consonants are found in
Arabic, for example, and are transcribed [q] and [g] for the voiceless and voiced
types respectively. Uvularization is a general term referring to any secondary
articulation involving a movement of the back part of the tongue towards the
uvula; such sounds are said to be uvularized. See also -ise/-ize.

valency (n.)
A term introduced by the French linguist Lucien Tesnière (1893–
1954), which has been particularly inﬂuential in the development of models of
dependency grammar in Europe and Russia. The term is derived from chem-
istry, and is used in linguistics to refer to the number and type of bonds which
syntactic elements may form with each other; this ‘combining capacity’ is also
known as adicity or arity. As in chemistry, a given element may have different
valencies in different contexts. A valency grammar presents a model of a sentence
containing a fundamental element (typically, the verb) and a number of dependent
elements (variously referred to as arguments, expressions, complements or
valents) whose number and type is determined by the valency attributed to the
verb. For example, the valency of vanish includes only the subject element (it
has a valency of 1, monovalent, or monadic), whereas that of scrutinize includes
both subject and direct object (a valency of 2, bivalent, or dyadic). Verbs
which take more than two complements are polyvalent, or polyadic. A verb
which takes no complements at all (such as rain) is said to have zero valency
(be avalent). Valency deals not only with the number of valents with which a
verb is combined to produce a well-formed sentence nucleus, but also with
the classiﬁcation of sets of valents which may be combined with different verbs.
For example, give and put usually have a valency of 3 (trivalent), but the valents
governed by the former (subject, direct object and indirect object) are different
from those governed by the latter (subject, direct object, and locative adver-
bial). Verbs which differ in this way are said to be associated with different
valency sets. The notion is similar to that used in case grammar, where cases
are sometimes referred to as valency roles. See also actant, circonstant.
valent (n.)

valid (adj.)
A term used in logic and formal semantics to describe any
argument whose conclusion is a logical consequence of its premises. A valid
sentence is one which is logically true.

valley (n.)
see peak, syllable
value (n.) (1)
A term introduced into linguistics by Ferdinand de Saussure
(see Saussurean) to refer to the functional identity of an entity when seen
in the context of a rule-governed system. In his view, language is a system
of independent terms, in which the ‘value’ (valeur) of each term results solely
from the simultaneous presence of the others, related through the notions of
syntagmatic and paradigmatic association. The notion plays a central role in
the later development of structural linguistics.
(2)
The term is also used in grammatical theory as part of a feature speci-
ﬁcation, along with feature name. For example, in the speciﬁcations [V, –] and
[BAR 2], the ‘–’ and the ‘2’ are the feature values of the features V and BAR
respectively. Multi-valued features are often referred to as ‘n-ary’ features.
variable (adj./n.) (1)
A term sometimes used in the grammatical classiﬁcation
of words to refer to one of two postulated major word-classes in language,
the other being invariable. Variable words are said to be those which express
grammatical relationships through a change of form, e.g. boy/boys, walk/
walking, nice/nicer. Invariable (or invariant) words are unchanging, whatever
their distribution, e.g. in, on, and.
(2)
The term has been introduced into sociolinguistics by the American
linguist William Labov (b. 1927) to refer to the units in a language which are
most subject to social or stylistic variation, and thus most susceptible to
change in the long term. Sets of phonological, grammatical and lexical
variables are described quantitatively with reference to such factors as social
class, age and sex, and the results of this co-variation are stated in the form of
variable rules. Variable rules are generative rules which have been modiﬁed
so as to specify the socio-regional conditions under which they apply. The
notion has been developed primarily in relation to hypotheses concerning the
relationship between social variation and linguistic evolution.
(3)
The term is also widely used in grammar and semantics in its general
sense of a symbol which may assume any of a set of values. For example, a
category variable (e.g. X) stands for any major word-level category (e.g. N, P,
Adj); a bar variable, in X-bar syntax, stands for any level of bar projection
of X (e.g. Xn stands for Xo, X′, X″). pro-forms are often analysed semantically
as variables, especially when they are bound by quantiﬁcational anteced-
ents. In government-binding theory, the term refers to an A-bar-bound
trace.
variable binding operator
see operator (1)
variant (adj./n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a linguistic form which
is one of a set of alternatives in a given context; it contrasts with invariant.
The concept is fundamental to the notion of allo- (-phone, -morph, etc.), as
illustrated by the variant forms of the past-tense morpheme (/-t/, /-d/, /-}d/,
etc.). The choice of variants may be subject to contextual constraints (conditioned
variants), or there may be no stateable conditions – the cases of free variants
(see free).

variation (n.) (1)
In the study of universal grammar, a term which refers
to the range of possible differences which are found across languages. A con-
trast is intended with the properties shared by all languages (universals). In
optimality theory, variation is characterized by different rankings of the
same set of constraints.
(2)
See variable (2), variant, variety.
variety (n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics and stylistics to refer to any
system of linguistic expression whose use is governed by situational vari-
ables. In some cases, the situational distinctiveness of the language may
be easily stated, as in many regional and occupational varieties (e.g. London
English, religious English); in other cases, as in studies of social class, the variet-
ies are more difﬁcult to deﬁne, involving the intersection of several variables
(e.g. sex, age, occupation). Several classiﬁcations of language varieties have been
proposed, involving such terms as dialect, register, medium and ﬁeld. For
some sociolinguists, ‘variety’ is given a more restricted deﬁnition, as one kind of
situational distinctive language – a specialized type of language used within a
dialect, e.g. for occupational purposes.
velar (adj./n.)
A term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of consonant sounds
on the basis of their place of articulation: it refers to a sound made by the
back of the tongue against the soft palate, or velum (the ‘veil’ of the palate).
Examples in English are [k] and [ì], and the -ng- sound [º] as in sing. Velar
fricative sounds are found in German and Greek, for example, and are tran-
scribed [x] and [©] for the voiceless and voiced types respectively. If the velum
is raised to shut off the nasal tract, a velic closure has been made.
Velar sounds are different from velaric sounds. The term ‘velaric’ refers to
a quite different mode of speech production: instead of using an airstream
mechanism involving the lungs, velaric sounds use air generated by a closure in
velar position. The back of the tongue is raised against the velum, and articula-
tions are made further forward by the lips or front parts of the tongue. These
sounds are usually called clicks, and have a distinctive role in some languages,
such as Zulu. In English, they may be heard in the ‘tut tut’ sound, and in a few
other contexts.
Velarization is a general term referring to any secondary articulation
involving a movement of the back part of the tongue towards the velum. For a
sound to be velarized, of course, its primary place of articulation must be
elsewhere in the mouth, e.g. a [z] sound, normally made in alveolar position,
is said to be velarized if during its articulation the back of the tongue is raised
towards the soft palate; this would give the sound a distinctive back (or ‘dark’)
resonance. The term is usually applied to consonants other than velar conson-
ants; it can be used with reference to vowels, but such variations in vowel
articulation are usually described in different terms (‘centralized’, ‘retracted’,
etc.). The velarization may be an essential feature of the sound’s identity, con-
trasting with other non-velarized sounds, as in the distinction between velarized
and non-velarized s in Arabic (transcribed [p] and [s] respectively). In English,
velarization is dependent on context: syllable-ﬁnal l, as in cool, is given a velar
resonance; this can be compared with syllable-initial l, as in leap, where the
back of the tongue is much further forward in the mouth (towards the palate).
velar
509

A loose auditory label for velar resonance sounds is ‘dark’ (dark l, etc.),
opposed to ‘clear’, used for the palatal-resonance sounds. The usual symbol for
velarized consonants is [~], placed through the letter, as in [q], [r], [l]. Some
dialects, such as those of the English Midlands (Birmingham, Wolverhampton,
etc.), have several velarized sounds. See also -ise/-ize.

ventricular (adj.)
A term used in phonetics to describe a type of sound pro-
duced between the ventricular bands, or ‘false’ vocal folds, which lie immedi-
ately above and parallel with the true vocal folds. It is not normally used in
speech, but ventricular effects involving whisper and voice can be heard, the latter
sometimes combining with glottal voice to produce a ‘double’ or ‘diplophonic’
voice (or ‘diplophonia’).
verb (v.) (v, V)
A term used in the grammatical classiﬁcation of words, to
refer to a class traditionally deﬁned as ‘doing’ or ‘action’ words (a description
which has been criticized in linguistics, largely on the grounds that many
verbs do not ‘act’ in any obvious sense, e.g. seem, be). The formal deﬁnition of
a verb refers to an element which can display morphological contrasts of
tense, aspect, voice, mood, person and number. functionally, it is the
element which, singly or in combination with other verbs (i.e. as a ‘verb
phrase’), is used as the minimal predicate of a sentence, co-occurring with a
subject, e.g. she/wrote. If the predicate contains other elements (e.g. object,
complement, adverbial), then it is the verb which more than any other is the
unit which inﬂuences the choice and extent of these elements; e.g. the verb put
takes both an object and a locative adverbial, as in he put the book on the
table. In many grammatical theories, accordingly, the verb is considered the
most important element in sentence structure.
The term verb phrase is used in two senses. Traditionally, it refers to a group
of verbs which together have the same syntactic function as a single verb,
e.g. is coming, may be coming, get up to. In such phrases (verbal groups, verbal
clusters), one verb is the main verb (a lexical verb) and the others are sub-
ordinate to it (auxiliary verbs, catenative verbs). A verb followed by a non-verbal
particle (similar in form to a preposition or adverb) is generally referred to as
a phrasal verb.
In generative grammar, the verb phrase (VP) has a much broader deﬁnition,
being equivalent to the whole of the predicate of a sentence, as is clear from the
expansion of S as NP+VP in phrase-structure grammar. In the minimalist
programme, the head of the upper vp shell is referred to as little v.
The adjective from ‘verb’, verbal, is often used in traditional grammatical
description (though one must be careful not to confuse it with ‘verbal’ meaning
‘spoken’, as in ‘verbal skill’, ‘verbalize’, etc.), for instance ‘verbal noun’ (= a
noun similar in form or meaning to a verb, e.g. smoking), ‘verbal adjective’
(= an adjective similar in form or meaning to a verb, e.g. interested). See
also communication, extensive, factitive, mood, performative, serial
verb.

verbal duelling
In sociolinguistics, a term which refers to the competitive
use of language, within a game-like structure, with rules that are known and
used by the participants. It is a genre of verbal play – a ritual dialogue in
which each speaker attempts to outdo an opponent by producing an utterance
of increased verbal ingenuity. It has been noted, for example, in the ritual
exchanges between warriors in classical epic texts as well as in the trading of
insults between present-day street gangs.

In sociolinguistics, a term which refers to the playful manipula-

ludic function of language which includes play languages, puns, verbal duel-
ling, riddles, and many other genres.
verbless (adj.)
A type of clause recognized in some models of grammatical
description (e.g. Quirk grammar), in which the verb is omitted (and often the
subject as well), e.g. When ready, we waited for the signal, Stay at home if
possible. Some classical transformational models of analysis would derive
such structures using a process of deletion. In later generative studies such
constructions have been analysed as base-generated – a type of small clause.
verb phrase

verb second (V2)
In grammar, a term describing a language in which the
verb appears as the second element in a clause. Examples include German and
Dutch. German, for example, requires In Deutschland ﬁndet man . . . , whereas
the English equivalent can place the verb third (In Germany one ﬁnds . . . ).
vernacular (adj./n.)
A term used in sociolinguistics to refer to the indigenous
language or dialect of a speech community, e.g. the vernacular of Liverpool,
Berkshire, Jamaica, etc. The study of African-American Vernacular English
(AAVE) in the United States has been the focus of several linguistic studies
since the 1960s, though terminology has varied repeatedly (terms include Black
Vernacular English, Vernacular Black English, Black English Vernacular, Afro-
American English, or simply Black English, with associated abbreviations,
e.g. BVE, BEV). pidgin languages are sometimes called contact vernaculars.
Vernaculars are usually seen in contrast to such notions as standard, lingua
franca, etc., chieﬂy in their lack of conscious attention to its style of speech.
The vernacular principle is the view that it is this variety which will convey the
best insight into the natural speech of a community, and the one which will
show the closest connection with the language’s history.
Verner’s law
In historical linguistics and philology, a sound change,
ﬁrst worked out by the Danish linguist Karl Verner (1846–96), which explained
a class of apparent exceptions to Grimm’s law. He found that Grimm’s law
Verner’s law
511

worked well whenever the stress fell on the root syllable of the Sanskrit
word; but when it fell on another syllable, the consonants behaved differently.
Voiceless plosives then did not stay as voiceless fricatives, but became
voiced plosives.

V forms
An abbreviation used in sociolinguistics as part of the study of
terms of address in various languages. Based on the distinction between tu and
vous, the alternative forms of ‘you’ in French, and on similar contrasts in
many other languages (e.g. German du/Sie, Russian ty/vy), an opposition is set
up between formal (V) and familiar (T) second-person verb and pronoun
forms. Hypotheses are then developed concerning the system of formality in
use in the language.
via /va}v/ (adj.)
A term used in natural generative phonology, to refer to
the (non-generative) rules which link distinct underlying forms. For exam-
ple, divine/divinity would be linked by a rule /a}/↔/i/, though each form would
be listed individually in the lexicon.
violation (n.)
In optimality theory, a term referring to the failure of a form
to meet (satisfy) a constraint. Constraint violations can be all-or-nothing
(binary) or counted individually (gradient). A violation is symbolized by an
asterisk in an optimality tableau. An exclamation mark symbolizes a ‘fatal’
violation, i.e. one which completely eliminates a candidate.
visibility (n.)
A term used in government-binding theory for a condition
from which much of the content of the case ﬁlter can be derived. An element
is visible for theta-marking only if it is assigned Case. On the basis of this
condition, a noun phrase can receive a theta role only if it is in a position to
which Case is assigned, or is linked to such a position (as in there is a lamp in
the room, where Case is transferred from there to the lamp).
visual sonority

vocable (n.)

vocabulary (n.)
linguistics uses this term in its everyday sense, reserving for
its technical study the use of terms beginning with lexi- (see lexis, lexicon). A
distinction is often made, especially in language learning, between active and
passive vocabulary: the former refers to lexical items people use; the latter to
words which they understand, but do not themselves use. See also deﬁning
vocabulary.
vocal–auditory channel
A term used in the study of communication to refer
to one of the human sensory modes which can be used for the transmission and
reception of information. It provides the frame of reference within which the
study of phonetics proceeds, and constitutes the majority of the subject-matter
of linguistics (which of course is also concerned with the written language).

vocal folds
Two muscular folds running from a single point inside the front of
the thyroid cartilage (Adam’s apple) backwards to the front ends of the arytenoid
cartilages; also called vocal cords, and sometimes (though not usually in phon-
etics) vocal lips or bands. The vocal folds are very ﬂexible, being shaped by the
combined activities of the associated cartilages and muscles. The space between
them is known as the glottis.
The vocal folds have several functions. Their main role in speech is to vibrate in
such a manner as to produce voice, a process known as phonation. When the
folds are not vibrating, two main alternative positions are available. They may be
tightly closed (‘adducted’), as when the breath is held – a process which produces
a glottal stop upon release. Or they may remain open (‘abducted’), so that the
breath ﬂowing through the glottis produces audible friction, as in whispering
and the [h] sound. Other ‘phonation types’ are possible, by varying the mode of
vibration of the vocal folds in various ways, as in breathy and creaky voice.
Varying the thickness, length and tension of the vocal folds also produces the
different registers in voice production, such as the distinction between ‘fal-
setto’ and ‘chest’ voice. Lastly, by varying the rate and strength of vibration of
the vocal folds, variations in pitch and loudness can be introduced into speech.
The question of how precisely the vocal folds operate, from a physiological
viewpoint, has been the subject of controversy, and is still not wholly under-
stood. The most widely held theory maintains that the folds are set in vibration
aerodynamically, solely by a reaction taking place between their elastic proper-
ties and the subglottal air-pressure involved – this is known as the ‘myoelastic’
theory of voice production. An alternative theory, developed in the 1950s, argued
that the folds are set in motion as a result of periodic neural stimulation and
contraction of the muscles – this was known as the ‘neurochronaxiac’ theory.
vocal fry
see creaky
vocalic (adj.) (voc)
One of the major class features of sound set up by
generative phonologists in their distinctive feature theory of phonology,
its opposite being non-vocalic. Vocalic sounds may be deﬁned articulatorily
or acoustically in this approach: they are sounds where there is a free passage
of air through the vocal tract, the most radical constriction in the oral
cavity not exceeding that found in [i] and [u], and the vocal folds being
positioned so as to allow spontaneous voicing; acoustically, there is a sharply
deﬁned formant structure. Non-vocalic sounds lack one or other of these
conditions. See also vowel.
vocalization (n.) (1)
A general term used in linguistics and phonetics to
refer to an utterance viewed solely as a sequence of sound. No reference is
made to its linguistic structure, and indeed, in such phrases as ‘infant vocaliza-
tion’, there may be no such structure. In a somewhat more restricted sense, the
term is sometimes used referring to the use of sound involving vocal-fold
vibration – a vocalization is then ‘any voiced sound’.
vocalization

(2)
In phonetics, a term referring to the process of changing a consonant
articulation so that it becomes more vowel-like. For example, some regional
accents of English, such as Cockney, have vocalized ﬁnal /-l/, so that /wel/ is
produced as [weä].
vocal lips
see vocal folds
vocal organs
The collective term for all the anatomical features involved in the
production of speech sounds, including the lungs, trachea, oesophagus, larynx,
pharynx, mouth and nose.
vocal qualiﬁer
see voice qualiﬁer
vocal tract
A general term used in phonetics to refer to the whole of the
air passage above the larynx, the shape of which is the main factor affecting
the quality of speech sounds. It can be divided into the nasal tract (the air
passage above the soft palate, within the nose) and the oral tract (the mouth
and pharyngeal areas, or cavities). In a more general application, the term is
used in the sense of vocal organs, including all the features of the respirat-
ory tract involved in the production of sounds, i.e. lungs, trachea and larynx
as well.
vocative (adj./n.)
In languages which express grammatical relationships by
means of inﬂections, this term refers to the case form taken by a noun
phrase (often a single noun or pronoun) when it is used in the function of
address (including both animate and inanimate entities). English does not make
use of the vocative case (‘the vocative’) inﬂectionally, but expresses the notion
using an optional noun phrase, in certain positions, and usually with a distinc-
tive intonation, as in Jane, are you ready?
vocoid (n.)
A term invented by the American phonetician Kenneth Pike (1912–
2000) to help distinguish between the phonetic and the phonological
notions of vowel. Phonetically, a vowel is deﬁned as a sound lacking any closure
or narrowing sufﬁcient to produce audible friction. Phonologically, it is a unit
which functions at the centre of syllables. In cases such as [l], [r], [w] and [j],
however, these criteria do not coincide: these sounds are phonetically vowel-
like, but their function is consonantal. To avoid possible confusion, Pike
proposed the term ‘vocoid’ for sounds which are characterized by a phonetic
deﬁnition such as the above; the term ‘vowel’ is then reserved for the phonological
sense. Its opposite is contoid. Since the 1980s, the term has become fashionable
in feature geometry models of phonology, where it is often used to designate
one of the two chief classes of segments (the other being consonants).
voice (n.) (1)
A fundamental term used in the phonetic classiﬁcation of speech
sounds, referring to the auditory result of the vibration of the vocal folds;
also called voicing. Sounds produced while the vocal folds are vibrating are
voiced sounds, e.g. [b, z, a, i]; those produced with no such vibration are voice-
less or unvoiced, e.g. [p, s, h]. A sound which is normally voiced, but which in
a particular phonetic environment is produced with less voice than elsewhere,
514
vocal lips

or with no voice at all, is said to be devoiced (symbolized by a small circle
beneath the symbol) – examples are the reduced voicing on voiced plosives in
a word-ﬁnal position as in bib, bed [b}s], [be!].
This contrast is considered to be of primary signiﬁcance in phonological
analysis, and is used as a main parameter of classiﬁcation both in phonemic
and distinctive feature theories of phonology. Voiced, for example, is one
of the source features of sound set up by Chomsky and Halle in their phono-
logical theory (see Chomskyan). Voiced sounds are deﬁned articulatorily, as
those where the vocal folds are in a position which will enable them to vibrate
in an airﬂow. Its opposite is non-voiced (or voiceless), referring to sounds where
vocal-fold vibration is impossible, because of the wide gap between them.
(2)
A category used in the grammatical description of sentence or clause
structure, primarily with reference to verbs, to express the way sentences may
alter the relationship between the subject and object of a verb, without chang-
ing the meaning of the sentence. The main distinction is between active and
passive, as illustrated by The cat bit the dog and The dog was bitten by the cat:
in the ﬁrst sentence, the grammatical subject is also the actor; in the second
sentence the grammatical subject is the goal of the action – it is ‘acted upon’,
and thus ‘passive’. There will be certain differences in the emphasis or style of
these sentences, which will affect the speaker’s choice, but the factual content of
the two sentences remains the same. In other languages, further contrasts in
voice may be encountered, e.g. the ‘middle’ voice of Greek (which included verbs
with a reﬂexive meaning, e.g. She cut herself ), and there are several other types
of construction whose role in language is related to that of voice, e.g. ‘reﬂexive’,
causative, ‘impersonal’ constructions. Voice contrasts may be formally marked
in the verb (e.g. by inﬂection, word-order or the use of special auxiliar-
ies), or elsewhere in the sentence (e.g. by the use of passive ‘agent’); the English
passive can involve all three factors, as in I was kicked by a bull.
voiced (adj.)
see voice (1)
voice dynamics
A term used by some phoneticians as a collective term to
refer to vocal effects other than voice quality and segmental features, e.g.
loudness, tempo, rhythm, register. These effects are capable of differentiat-
ing meanings and speech communities, and are thus held to be within the
purview of linguistics.
voiceless (adj.)
see voice (1)
voice-onset time (VOT)
A term used in phonetics, referring to the point in
time at which vocal-fold vibration starts, in relation to the release of a closure.
In a fully voiced plosive, for example, the vocal folds vibrate throughout; in a
voiceless unaspirated plosive, there is a delay (or lag) before voicing starts; in a
voiceless aspirated plosive, the delay is much longer, depending on the amount
of aspiration. The amount of the delay, in relation to the types of plosive,
varies from language to language.
voiceprint (n)
A display of a person’s voice based upon a spectrographic
or similar output. The analogy is with the term ‘ﬁngerprint’, and the claim is
voiceprint
515

sometimes made that a person’s voice is as individual as ﬁngerprints. Several
legal cases have in fact used voiceprints as evidence of speaker identiﬁcation.
But, while there are several idiosyncratic features in a spectrogram of a person’s
voice, it is not the case that such displays are always unequivocal indications of
identity. It is difﬁcult to visually compare and interpret sets of spectrographic
features, and the limitations of the display techniques used must always be
borne in mind.
voice qualiﬁer
A term used by some linguists as part of their analysis of the
paralinguistic features of the voice; also called a vocal qualiﬁer. Examples are
the expression of various emotional states, such as anger or sarcasm, by means
of vocal effects such as a ‘harsh’ or ‘tense’ quality – effects which are sometimes
speciﬁc to individual languages. The term voice quality is sometimes used in a
general sense to include these effects.
voice quality
A term used in phonetics to refer to the permanently present,
background, person-identifying feature of speech; also called voice set. All phon-
etic features contribute to this notion: an individual’s voice quality derives from
a combination of such factors as pitch height, loudness level, tempo and
timbre of speaking. Labels for the many qualities that can be produced tend
to be impressionistic and ambiguous, e.g. a ‘cheery’, ‘haughty’, ‘sullen’ voice. A
terminological problem also arises because such labels may be used both in a
non-linguistic way (as described above) and in a linguistic or paralinguistic
context, as when someone who normally does not have a voice one would call
‘sullen’ deliberately adopts such a voice to communicate a particular emotional
state. To classify such latter effects, terms such as voice qualiﬁer or
‘paralinguistic feature’ are available, but ‘voice quality’ is also commonly used.

volition (n.)
A term used in the semantic analysis of grammatical categories,
referring to a kind of relationship between an agent and a verb. A volitional
verb or construction is one where the action takes place as a consequence of the
agent’s choice, e.g. Mary left. A non-volitional verb or construction is one where
the agent has no determining inﬂuence on the action, e.g. Mary slipped. Many
verbs allow both interpretations (e.g. X hit Y – accidentally or on purpose?).
The notion has also had a contrastive role in the analysis of the meanings
of certain auxiliary verbs in English: for example, the volitional sense of will in
I will go (in the sense of ‘it is my decision to go’) is distinguished from other
senses, such as characteristic action (They’ll sit there for hours).
516
voice qualiﬁer

vowel (n.) (V)
One of the two general categories used for the classiﬁcation
of speech sounds, the other being consonant. Vowels can be deﬁned in terms
of both phonetics and phonology. Phonetically, they are sounds articulated
without a complete closure in the mouth or a degree of narrowing which
would produce audible friction; the air escapes evenly over the centre of the
tongue. If air escapes solely through the mouth, the vowels are said to be oral;
if some air is simultaneously released through the nose, the vowels are nasal. In
addition to this, in a phonetic classiﬁcation of vowels, reference would generally
be made to two variables, the ﬁrst of which is easily describable, the second
much less so: (a) the position of the lips – whether rounded, spread, or neutral;
(b) the part of the tongue raised, and the height to which it moves.
Relatively slight movements of the tongue produce quite distinct auditory
differences in vowel (or vocalic) quality. Because it is very difﬁcult to see or feel
these movements, classiﬁcation of vowels is usually carried out using acoustic
or auditory criteria, supplemented by details of lip position. There are several
systems for representing vowel position visually, e.g. in terms of a vowel triangle
or a vowel quadrilateral such as the cardinal vowel system.
These sounds are usually voiced, though some languages have been analysed
as having ‘voiceless’ vowels, e.g. Portuguese. From a phonological point of view,
vowels are those units which function at the centre of syllables. In some
approaches, the term ‘vowel’ is reserved for the phonological level of analysis;
vocoid is then used for the phonetic level (as opposed to contoid, for the
phonetic equivalent of a consonant). The usefulness of this distinction is in
relation to those sounds which are vowel-like in articulation, but which function
as consonants in syllables: [r], for example, is phonetically very similar to a
vowel, but it occurs at the margins of English syllables, as in red, car. In such
cases, it is sometimes clearer to talk of a ‘vocoid with consonantal function’.
In establishing the vowel system of a language, several further dimensions of
classiﬁcation may be used. One criterion is in terms of the duration of the vowel
(whether relatively ‘long’ or ‘short’ vowels are used). Another is whether, during
an articulation, there is any detectable change in quality. If the quality of a
vowel stays unchanged, the term pure vowel, or monophthong, is used, e.g.
the standard British pronunciation of red, car, sit, seat. If there is an evident
change in quality, one talks instead of a gliding vowel. If two auditory elements
are involved, the vowel glide is referred to as a diphthong, e.g. light, say, go;
if three elements, as a triphthong, e.g. ﬁre, hour (in some pronunciations). In
the distinctive feature theory of phonology, the term vocalic is used as the
main feature in the analysis of vowel sounds.
Yet another way of classifying vowels is in terms of the amount of muscular
tension required to produce them: vowels articulated in extreme positions are
more ‘tense’ than those articulated nearer the centre of the mouth, which are
‘lax’: cf. seat v. sit, ﬂute v. foot. See also anaptyxis, harmony.

VP-internal subject hypothesis
In government-binding theory, a hypothesis
about a phrase structure in which a subject is base-generated within the
verb phrase. In languages such as English, the subject of a sentence starts as a
VP-speciﬁer, and moves to be a tense phrase (TP) speciﬁer.
V-place (n.)
see constriction, place
VP shell
In government-binding theory and the minimalist programme,
a view of the verb phrase in terms of two different projections, each of which
is called a ‘shell’. VPs are seen as having an outer VP shell and an inner VP shell.
Some arguments (e.g. agent) originate within the outer shell and some (e.g.
theme) within the inner shell. The notion was introduced by Richard Larson
(b. 1952) in relation to such constructions as the double-object (e.g. She gave
the dog a drink). The derivation of a VP-shell structure involves the adjunction
of a verb to a light verb, forming a complex category of the form V-v.

wanna-contraction (n.)
A term used in extended standard theory and
government-binding theory for the process deriving I wanna go home from
I want to go home. It was suggested that restrictions on wanna-contraction
and similar processes provide evidence for the view that processes leave behind
traces.
wave (n.) (1)
A term used in historical linguistics and sociolinguistics
as part of a dynamic model of language change: wave theory suggests that
speech variations spread from a speciﬁc linguistic area, having maximum effect
on adjacent languages, and progressively less effect on languages further away –
in much the same way that waves in water radiate from a central point of
contact. See also diffusion.
(2)
A term used in tagmemic grammar as one mode of the analysis of lin-
guistic units: in the wave mode, units at any level are analysed in terms of
their status as variants manifested in different contexts, e.g. morphemic or
transformational processes. This mode is contrasted with the analysis of
units in terms of particles and ﬁelds.

weak form
One of two possible pronunciations for a word, in the context of
connected speech, the other being strong. The weak form is that which is
the result of a word being unstressed, as in the normal pronunciation of of in
cup of tea, and in most other grammatical words. Several words in English
have more than one weak form, e.g. and [ænd] can be [vnd], [vn], [n], etc. The
notion is also applied to syntactically conditioned forms, such as my (weak)
v. mine (strong).

weather it
A term sometimes used in grammatical theory for the expletive
or dummy element in such sentences as It was raining. It is distinct from
anticipatory it. See also expletive.
weight (n.) (1)
In phonology, a concept used to distinguish levels of syllabic
prominence, based on the segmental constituency of syllables. Syllables can
be metrically heavy (H) or light (L): a light (or ‘weak’) syllable is one whose
rhyme comprises a short-vowel nucleus alone or followed by a coda of no
more than one short consonant (in terms of phonological length, a mora); a
heavy (or ‘strong’) syllable is any other type (its phonological length being
greater than one mora). Syllables of structure CVVC or CVCC are sometimes
referred to as ‘superheavy’. The weight-to-stress principle is the tendency for
heavy syllables to receive stress. The notion of weight has also come to be
important in several models of non-linear phonology. See also compens-
atory lengthening.
(2)
In syntax, a concept which relates the relative length/complexity of dif-
ferent elements of sentence structure. For example, a clause as subject or
object would be considered heavier than a lexical noun phrase, which would
be heavier than a pronoun. Such variations in length and complexity seem to
inﬂuence the order of elements in languages: for example, there is a preference
for short > long linearization in right-branching (VO) languages, and for long >
short in left-branching (OV) languages.
well formed (adj.)
A term used in linguistics, especially in generative gram-
mar, to refer to the grammaticality (well-formedness) of a sentence. A
sentence is well formed if it can be generated by the rules of a grammar; it is
ill formed if it cannot be. The term applies equally to syntax, semantics and
phonology.
wh-
The usual abbreviation for a wh-word – a question word (interrogative
word) or relative item, such as what, who, which, when, why, how, etc. It is
used generally in linguistics with reference to wh-complements, wh-movement,
questions (wh-questions) and relative clauses (wh-relatives). A wh-question is a
term used in the grammatical subclassiﬁcation of question types to refer to a
question beginning with a question word. A multiple wh-question contains more
than one wh-phrase. These ‘particular’ or ‘question word’ questions are contrasted
with YES–NO questions. The term is commonly used in the context of gener-
ative grammar. A wh-NP is a noun phrase introduced by a wh-word (e.g.
which car, what interest). Wh-movement (wh-fronting or wh-preposing) is used
to refer to a transformational rule which moves a wh-phrase (wh-XP) to
initial position in the sentence. For example, given a deep structure of the
520
weak generative capacity

sentence Who did you see? as ‘You past see who’, applying wh-movement
would result in ‘Who you past see’. Wh-islands are constructions beginning with
a wh-phrase, out of which it is not possible to move a constituent through a
transformational rule (the wh-island constraint). In later generative linguistics,
several other types of construction are analysed in a way similar to wh-ques-
tions, such as that-relatives and comparatives; they are known as unbounded
dependencies. See also in situ, trace.
whistle-speech (n.)
A term used in linguistics to refer to a stylized form of
communication, in which whistling substitutes for the tones of normal speech;
also called whistled speech. In some dialects (such as Mazatec, in Mexico)
quite sophisticated conversations have been observed to take place using
whistle-speech. An analogous system of communication is drum-signalling.
whiz-deletion (n.)
A term used in earlier models of generative grammar to
refer to a transformational rule which deletes a relative pronoun and
its associated verb (variations of be) from a relative clause to produce a
postmodifying phrase, e.g. the woman who was in the street becoming the
woman in the street.
Whorﬁan (adj./n.)
Characteristic of, or a follower of, the views of Benjamin
Lee Whorf (1897–1941), especially as propounded in the Whorﬁan hypothesis
(alternatively, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), which states that our conceptual
categorization of the world is determined (wholly or partly) by the structure
of our native language. In its strong form, the hypothesis is not accepted by
most linguists.
wh-trace (n.)
see trace
wide (adj.)
A term used in the description of types of vowel, referring to
a vowel which is articulated with greater pharynx width than another with
the same tongue and lip conﬁguration; it is opposed to narrow. The effect is
achieved by drawing the root of the tongue forward and lowering the larynx.
Twi and Akan (West Africa) use a contrast of this kind.
window (n.)
In phonetics, the name of a model of coarticulation which
recognizes a range of articulatory or acoustic values with which a feature
(e.g. degree of nasalization or lip-rounding) is associated. Windows have a
width which represents the range of a segment’s contextual variability: narrow
windows allow for little variation; wide windows allow for a great deal. Adjacent
windows are connected by paths, or contours, constrained by the requirements
of smoothness and minimal articulatory effort.
W-level (n.)
see harmonic phonology
word (n.)
A unit of expression which has universal intuitive recognition by
native-speakers, in both spoken and written language. However, there are
several difﬁculties in arriving at a consistent use of the term in relation to other
categories of linguistic description, and in the comparison of languages of
word
521

different structural types. These problems relate mainly to word identiﬁcation
and deﬁnition. They include, for example, decisions over word boundaries (e.g.
is a unit such as washing machine two words, or is it one, to be written
washing-machine?), as well as decisions over status (e.g. is the a word in the
same sense as is chair?). Regular deﬁnitions of words as ‘units of meaning’, or
‘ideas’ are of no help, because of the vagueness of such notions as ‘idea’. As a
result, several theoretical distinctions have been made.
Three main senses of ‘word’ are usually distinguished (though terminology
varies):
(a)
Words are the physically deﬁnable units which one encounters in a stretch
of writing (bounded by spaces) or speech (where identiﬁcation is more difﬁcult,
but where there may be phonological clues to identify boundaries, such as a
pause, or juncture features). ‘Word’ in this sense is often referred to as the
orthographic word (for writing) or the phonological word (for speech). A neutral
term often used to subsume both is word form.
(b)
There is a more abstract sense, referring to the common factor underly-
ing the set of forms which are plainly variants of the same unit, such as walk,
walks, walking, walked. The ‘underlying’ word unit is often referred to as a
lexeme. Lexemes are the units of vocabulary, and as such would be listed in
a dictionary.
(c)
This then leaves the need for a comparably abstract unit to be set up to
show how words work in the grammar of a language, and ‘word’, without
qualiﬁcation, is usually reserved for this role (alternatively, one may spell out
this implication, referring to ‘morphemic/morphosyntactic/grammatical’
words, though the latter has an alternative sense). A word, then, is a grammatical
unit, of the same theoretical kind as morpheme and sentence. In a hierarchical
model of analysis, sentences (clauses, etc.) consist of words, and words consist
of morphemes (minimally, one free morpheme). Word-order refers to the
sequential arrangement of words in a language. Languages are sometimes clas-
siﬁed in terms of whether their word-order is relatively ‘free’ (as in Latin) or
‘ﬁxed’ (as in English).
Several criteria have been suggested for the identiﬁcation of words in speech
(criteria which would apply to the written language as well, if they were needed).
One is that words are the most stable of all linguistic units, in respect of their
internal structure, i.e. the constituent parts of a complex word have little
potential for rearrangement, compared with the relative positional mobility
of the constituents of sentences and other grammatical structures (cf.
disestablishment, where the sequence of dis-establish-ment is ﬁxed, and all boys
like girls, where many alternative sequences are possible, e.g. boys all like girls).
A second criterion refers to the relative ‘uninterruptibility’ or cohesiveness of
words, i.e. new elements (including pauses) cannot usually be inserted within
them in normal speech: pauses, by contrast, are always potentially present at
word boundaries. A criterion which has inﬂuenced linguists’ views of the word
since it was ﬁrst suggested by Leonard Bloomﬁeld (see Bloomﬁeldian) is the
deﬁnition of word as a ‘minimal free form’, i.e. the smallest unit which can
constitute, by itself, a complete utterance (it contrasts here with sentence, seen
as the maximal free form recognized by most grammars). On this basis, possibil-
ity is a word, as is possible (contexts could be constructed which would enable
such units to occur as single-element sentences, e.g. Is that a probable outcome?
522
word

Possible.), but -ity is not (nor would any afﬁx be). Not all word-like units
satisfy this criterion, however (e.g. a and the in English), and how to handle
these has been the subject of considerable discussion.
Several general subclassiﬁcations of words have been proposed, such as the
distinction between variable and invariable types, grammatical (or func-
tion) words v. lexical words, closed-class v. open-class words, empty v.
full words. At a more speciﬁc level, word-classes can be established, by analys-
ing the various grammatical, semantic and phonological properties dis-
played by the words in a language, and grouping words into classes on the basis
of formal similarities (e.g. their inﬂections and distribution). The results are
analogous to the traditional notion of ‘parts of speech’, but word-classes usually
display a wider range of more precisely deﬁned classes, e.g. particles, auxiliar-
ies, etc., alongside nouns, verbs, etc., and lack the vagueness of many of
the traditional notional deﬁnitions (e.g. a noun as the ‘name of a person, place
or thing’). The study of the structure and composition of words (see word-
formation) is carried on by morphology. The study of the arrangements
of words in sentences is the province of syntax. The notion of ‘prosodic word’
is central to some theories of phonological structure, as is the notion of a
‘minimal word’ (one which contains at least two moras/syllables).
word accent
see accent (2)
word and paradigm (WP)
A morphological model of description which
sees the word as the basic unit of analysis, operating within a set of variables
which constitute a paradigm. This is the traditional model of description, as
illustrated from Latin grammars (e.g. amo, amas, amat . . . constitutes the para-
digm of the lexeme amo). WP is seen as a major alternative to the two other
main approaches to morphological analysis: item and process and item and
arrangement. In contrast to the traditional use of paradigms in language
study, linguistics does not arbitrarily choose one form of a word (the ‘leading
form’) as given, and derive the rest of the paradigm from this (the student
usually learning it by rote); rather, the aim is to deﬁne a common factor (a root
or stem) within the paradigm, neutral with respect to the variant forms of the
paradigm, and to derive the variant forms from this, e.g. using rules.

process of morphological variation in the constitution of words, i.e. including
the two main divisions of inﬂection (word variations signalling grammatical
relationships) and derivation (word variations signalling lexical relationships).
word-formation
523

In a more restricted sense, word-formation refers to the latter processes only,
these being subclassiﬁed into such types as ‘compositional’ or ‘compound’ (e.g.
black bird from the free elements black + bird), and ‘derivational’ (e.g. national,
nationalize, etc., from the addition of the bound elements -al, -ize, etc.). Several
possibilities of further subclassiﬁcation are available in the literature on this
subject. In generative grammar, word-formation rules (WFR) specify how to
form one class of words out of another.
word grammar (WG)
A grammatical theory which claims that grammatical
knowledge is largely a body of knowledge about words. It regards depend-
ency as the central relation in grammar, and assumes that constituency is
only important in connection with co-ordinate structures.
word-order (n.)
A term used in grammatical analysis to refer to the sequen-
tial arrangement of words in larger linguistic units. Some languages (e.g.
English) rely on word-order as a means of expressing grammatical relationships
within constructions; in others (e.g. Latin) word-order is more ﬂexible,
as grammatical relations are signalled by inﬂections. In later generative
linguistics, languages with fairly ﬁxed word-order are called conﬁgurational
languages; those with fairly free word-order are non-conﬁgurational
languages.

wugs (n.)
A nonsense word invented in the late 1950s for a language acqui-
sition experiment into the learning of morphology. The drawing of a myth-
ical animal (a wug) was presented to children, and the child was told: ‘This is a
wug’. Then the experimenter would point to a second picture, saying ‘Now,
there’s another one. There are two of them. There are two —.’ If the children
had learned the plural ending, they would say wugs; if they had not, they would
say wug. Using several such nonsense words in a range of morphological
contexts, much basic information was obtained concerning the order and timing
of the acquisition of grammatical morphemes. Several similar experimental
tasks have since been devised.

generative linguistics as an alternative to traditional accounts of phrase
structure and lexical categories. It is argued both that the rules of phrase-
structure grammar need to be more constrained (see constraint), and that
more phrasal categories need to be recognized. In particular, within the noun
phrase, the need is felt to recognize intermediate categories larger than the
noun but smaller than the phrase, e.g. very fast or very fast car in the phrase the
very fast car. These intermediate categories, which have no status in previous
phrase-structure models, are formally recognized in X-bar syntax by a system
of X-bars, each of which identiﬁes a level of phrasal expansion. Given a lexical
category, X, X0 = ‘X with no bars’ (i.e. ‘zero-bar’, the category itself); v = X1 =
‘X-bar’ = ‘X-single-bar’; w = X2 = ‘X-double-bar’; x = X3 = ‘X-treble-bar’; and
so on. For example, the following tree illustrates two levels of expansion for N
(‘N-bar’ and ‘N-double-bar’):
Each of the bar categories corresponding to X is known as a bar-projection of
X. The value of recognizing intermediate categories in this way is widely agreed,
but discussion continues about the number of categories which need to be
recognized, and how far it is possible to generalize rules of category formation
throughout a grammar. See also head, zero.

X-tier (n.)
A term used in autosegmental phonology to describe a conception
of the skeletal tier in which the feature [syllabic] is eliminated, segments
being speciﬁed for no features at all, thus contrasting with the cv-tier approach;
also known as the timing unit or timing tier theory. This approach is claimed to
have advantages in removing redundancy (the overlap in function between
syllable position and whether a position is a C or a V).

Y
yer (n.)
In the phonology of Slavic languages (e.g. Polish), a term used to
describe a type of very short high vowel which appears only in certain contexts;
also spelled jer. It has been seen as an illustration of a ghost segment, and
the question of its representation has attracted particular attention in non-
linear phonology. See also hard consonant, soft consonant.
yes–no question (y/n)
A term used in the grammatical subclassification of
types of question to refer to a question form where a grammatical reply would
have to be of the type yes or no. It is formally marked by inverted subject–
verb order, e.g. is she going? These ‘general’ or ‘inverted order’ questions are
contrasted with WH-questions.
yo-ho-ho theory
The name of one of the speculative theories about the origins
of language: it argues that speech arose because, as people worked together,
their physical efforts produced communal, rhythmical grunts, which in due
course developed into chants, and thus language. The main evidence is the use
of universal prosodic features (but these provide only a small part of language
structure). The term has no standing in contemporary linguistics.

Z
zero (adj./n.)
A term used in some areas of linguistics to refer to an abstract
unit postulated by an analysis, but which has no physical realization in the
stream of speech. Its symbol is 0⁄. In English morphology, for example, the
pressure of the grammatical system to analyse plurals as Noun + plural has led
some linguists to analyse unchanged nouns, such as sheep and deer, as Noun +
plural also, the plurality in these cases being realized as zero (a zero morph). A
‘zero operation’ of this kind is also called an ‘identity operation’, one where the
input and the output of the operation are identical. Similarly, in other gram-
matical contexts where a given morpheme usually occurs, the absence of that
morpheme under certain conditions may be referred to as zero, e.g. zero inﬁn-
itive, referring to the absence of to before the verb in English; zero article,
referring to the absence of a deﬁnite or indeﬁnite article before a noun; zero
connectors, as in he said he was coming, where that is omitted; zero valency,
referring in valency grammar to verbs which take no complements; and zero
relative clauses, as in the book I bought . . . In cases such as He’s laughing, is he,
some linguists analyse the second part of the sentence as a reduced form of the
verb phrase is he laughing, referring to the omitted part by the term zero
anaphora. Zero is also found in phonological analysis, e.g. in a conception of
some types of juncture as zero phonemes, or to suggest a structural parallelism
between syllable types (a CV sequence being seen as a CVC sequence, with the
ﬁnal C being zero).
Zero is especially encountered in the formulation of generative rules, where
the term refers to an item deleted from a given context (a ‘deletion rule’). Such
rules are of the type ‘rewrite A as zero, in the context X–Y’ (A ⇒  0⁄/X–Y), and
they apply in grammar, semantics and phonology. In X-bar syntax, a zero-
level or zero-bar category is a lexical category. It is plain that the introduc-
tion of zero (sometimes referred to as the null element, deriving from the use of
this term in mathematics) is motivated by the need to maintain a proportion-
ality, or regular pattern, in one’s analysis, or in the interests of devising an
economic statement. It is also a notion which has to be introduced with careful
justiﬁcation; too many zeros in an analysis weaken its plausibility.

zoösemiotics (n.)
A branch of semiotics that studies the features of human
communication which, as the end products of an evolutionary series, are shared
with animal systems of communication; opposed to ‘anthroposemiotic’ fea-
tures, which are exclusively human. Under the heading of ‘zoösemiotic features/
systems’ fall certain features of tone of voice (see paralanguage), facial expres-
sion, gesture, etc. (see kinesics, proxemics), as well as several mechanisms of
animal communication which seem not to overlap with human signalling systems
(e.g. chemical signals (pheromones), echolocation).
