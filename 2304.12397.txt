Abstract
Perception of toxicity evolves over time and often diﬀers between geographies and cultural back-
grounds. Similarly, black-box commercially available APIs for detecting toxicity, such as the Per-
spective API, are not static, but frequently retrained to address any unattended weaknesses and
biases. We evaluate the implications of these changes on the reproducibility of ﬁndings that com-
pare the relative merits of models and methods that aim to curb toxicity. Our ﬁndings suggest that
research that relied on inherited automatic toxicity scores to compare models and techniques may
have resulted in inaccurate ﬁndings. Rescoring all models from HELM, a widely respected living
benchmark, for toxicity with the recent version of the API led to a diﬀerent ranking of widely used
foundation models. We suggest caution in applying apples-to-apples comparisons between studies
and lay recommendations for a more structured approach to evaluating toxicity over time. Code
and data are available at https://github.com/for-ai/black-box-api-challenges.

Introduction
Detecting and measuring toxicity in language is a complex task that requires expertise in language
subtleties and contextual awareness that can vary by geography and cultural norms. Moreover,
with the ever-expanding size of datasets, auditing for toxicity has become infeasible for human
annotators (Jhaver et al., 2019; Veale & Binns, 2017; Siddiqui et al., 2022). Human annotation is
not only increasingly expensive but also poses a serious mental health risk to evaluators exposed
to highly toxic content, leaving them vulnerable to lasting psychological harm (Steiger et al., 2021;
Dang et al., 2018).
Automatic toxicity detection tools, which often use machine learning algorithms to quickly analyze
large amounts of data and identify patterns of toxic language, are a popular and cost-eﬀective
method of measurement (Welbl et al., 2021). For example, black-box commercial APIs are a widely
used tool for evaluating toxicity for online content moderation. These commercial APIs, such as
Perspective API1, have also been widely adopted for academic benchmarking of toxicity-related
work. For example, the RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) (Gehman et al., 2020) dataset leveraged
the Perspective API to generate toxicity scores in order to investigate the tendency of language

models (LMs) to generate toxic text. This dataset is frequently used to benchmark the toxicity of
widely used open-source and closed-source models, and also for academic benchmarking to assess
the relative merits of new proposed toxicity mitigation methods.
Despite the usefulness of automatic toxicity detection tools such as the Perspective API, relying on
commercial APIs for academic benchmarking poses a challenge to the reproducibility of scientiﬁc
results.
This is because black-box APIs are not static but frequently retrained to improve on
unattended weaknesses and biases (Lees et al., 2022; Mitchell et al., 2019). Updates to the API are
often poorly communicated and we observe that updates appear to have occurred in the absence
of any formal communication to users. As a result, this can impact static datasets with outdated
toxicity deﬁnitions and scores, such as the RTP dataset, or the reuse of previously released results
that had generated continuations scored with an older version of the API.
In this work, we ask how have changes to the API over time impacted the reproducibility of re-
search results?
Our results are surprising and suggest that the use of black-box APIs can have
a signiﬁcant adverse eﬀect on research reproducibility and rigorous assessment of model risk. We
observe signiﬁcant changes in the distributions of toxicity scores and show that benchmarking the
same models at diﬀerent points in time leads to diﬀerent ﬁndings, conclusions, and decisions. Our
ﬁndings suggest caution in applying like-for-like comparisons between studies and call for a more
structured approach to evaluating toxicity over time.
Our contributions are four-way:
1. We empirically validate that newer toxicity scores2 from the RTP dataset diﬀer substantially
from when the scores were released. The rescored dataset presents a 49% relative decrease in
the number of toxic prompts.
2. We consider the impact of changes to the rankings of widely used benchmarks. HELM (Liang
et al., 2022) is widely used to assess the risk of 37 prominent language models from open,
limited-access, or closed sources including OpenAI’s GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), BigScience’s
BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), and Microsoft’s TNLGv2 (Smith et al., 2022). We show that
comparing the same models at diﬀerent points in time leads to diﬀerent ﬁndings, conclusions,
and decisions. In total, 13 models had their results change, resulting in 24 changes in the
ranking for the Toxic Fraction metric.
3. We replicate toxicity mitigation benchmarks proposed and published from 2019-2023. We
observe that research results up until just a few months prior to our study were aﬀected
when rescored with a more recent version of the Perspective API. This poses a reproducibility
challenge for papers that inherit scores to evaluate the merits of new techniques.
4. We establish a set of recommendations for properly evaluating models for toxicity. We strongly
recommend authors rescore any text sequence used in their experiments to ensure appropriate
comparisons and suggest that changes to commercial black-box APIs should be more clearly
communicated to users.

- or not - at the same conclusions, ﬁndings or values”. The authors propose three dimensions of
reproducibility: 1) of conclusions, or validity of inductions made based on results from research;
2) of ﬁndings, a repeatable discovery based on the relationship between values; and 3) of values
measured or calculated.
Our goal in this work is to understand how reliance on black-box APIs for toxicity evaluation in
research impact all three axes. We rescore previously generated text using the Perspective API and
evaluate the implications of this rescoring on research reproducibility. We measure the impact of
changes in the Perspective API in three settings: 1) in toxicity scores and statistics of the widely-
used RealToxicityPrompts (RTP), 2) on the comparison of models’ toxicity over time in a
living benchmark and 3) on the reproducibility of proposed ﬁndings of toxicity mitigation research
techniques.
2.1
RealToxicityPrompts (RTP)
The RTP dataset, built from a selected sample of the OpenWebText Corpus (Gokaslan & Cohen,
2019), consists of 100K sentences in total, where 25K sentences are sampled from four equal-width
toxicity ranges obtained with Perspective API ([0,.25), . . . , [.75,1]). These sequences were then split
into prompts and continuations and each was rescored for toxicity with the Perspective API.
Given a comment, or text to be scored, the API predicts the perceived impact it may have had on a
3

conversation. A sequence of text is deemed toxic if Perspective API’s attribute of Toxicity > 0.53.
The toxicity attribute is deﬁned by the Perspective API as “a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable
comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion”. More details on the Perspective API and
its returned attributes are in Appendix A.
2.2
Evaluating Model Toxicity
To evaluate a language model’s toxicity, the standard protocol is to condition the model on a given
prompt and generate a continuation. The toxicity of the generated continuation is then evaluated
using the Perspective API, and results are separated based on whether the prompt was toxic or
non-toxic. This evaluation protocol, originally proposed with the RTP dataset, has been widely
adopted by subsequent work proposing toxicity mitigation techniques (Faal et al., 2022; Yang et al.,
2022; Liu et al., 2021b). We use three previously proposed aggregate metrics (Gehman et al., 2020;
Liang et al., 2022) to measure the impacts of API changes:
1. Expected Maximum Toxicity (EMT) is the maximum toxicity over k = 25 model genera-
tions for a given prompt (Gehman et al., 2020). This metric captures the worst-case scenario.
The higher the expected maximum toxicity, the more toxic we expect the worst-case scenario
to be.
2. Toxicity Probability (TP) is the empirical probability of generating a span with Toxicity
> 0.5 at least once over k = 25 generations (Gehman et al., 2020). This captures the frequency
with which we expect the model to generate toxicity.
3. Toxic Fraction (TF), deﬁned as the fraction of generated instances that are classiﬁed as
toxic (Liang et al., 2022).
We follow the proposed toxicity evaluation framework of Gehman et al. (2020) and report the metrics
for three scenarios: (1) results with published generations and prompts scores; (2) results with
rescored generations and published prompts scores; and (3) results with both rescored generations
and prompts.

RealToxicityPrompts Distribution Changes
Table 1 presents the statistics for the published RTP dataset, which was scored prior to September
2020. We rescored the same dataset using the Perspective API in February 2023. At the time of
release, the dataset contained about 22K toxic prompts, deﬁned as sequences with the probability
of Toxicity estimated to be greater than 0.5.
In the rescored dataset, we observe a remarkable reduction of 49% in the number of toxic prompts,
to around 11K. We also observe a reduction of 34% in the average toxicity scores. Speciﬁcally, 232
initially Non-Toxic prompts are now deemed Toxic, while around 10K Toxic prompts are now
3In the RTP paper, a toxic comment has Toxicity ≥0.5. However, in their code, they use Toxicity > 0.5. We
use the latter for comparability reasons.

Non-Toxic. We provide a qualitative evaluation of how the scores have changed from 2020 to now
in Appendix B.
In addition, we present the number of sequences (joint prompts and continuations) in each Toxicity
percentile bin in Table 2. We observe that the dataset distribution has shifted dramatically since its
original release, which originally reported 25K samples in each bin (constructed to have a uniform
distribution). The most impacted bucket was the one with the most probable toxic comments, with
scores in the range of 0.75 to 1.0. From the original 25K toxic comments, it now has around 5K.
On the other hand, the bucket with the least probable toxic comments increased from 25K to 48K
in size. This leads to the conclusion that there is a high probability that text classiﬁed as toxic in
2020 may no longer be considered toxic based on the Perspective API’s current standards.
In this work, we focus on toxicity, but the Perspective API returns a range of attributes for each input
including ‘threat’, ‘ﬂirtation’, and ‘profanity’. Figure 2 shows that the score distribution changes
not only for the toxicity attribute but for all other attributes returned from the Perspective API.
We computed the Wasserstein distances between published and current distributions. Intuitively,
it measures the minimum amount of work required to transform one distribution into another.
Attributes that changed the most were ‘threat’ and ‘severe toxicity’, with distances of 0.189 and

3.2
Impact of API Changes on Rankings of Model Risk
Gehman et al. (2020) ranked out-of-the-box models for toxicity – GPT1 (Radford et al., 2018),
GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019), CTRL-W
(Gehman et al., 2020). We evaluate how changes in the Perspective API impacted this comparison.
As the authors, in Figure 3 we report the EMT and TP metrics for the three scenarios mentioned
in section 2.
Scenario 1 reﬂects published results. Scenario 2 is what would happen if we rescored the model
continuations today and separated results with published prompts scores, as is done in most bench-
marks and research work (Liang et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Faal et al., 2022).
It is
technically an incorrect measure of toxicity as it contains diﬀerent toxicity deﬁnitions for prompts
and generations. When comparing scenarios 1 and 2, we observe that rescoring continuations leads
to lower toxicity metrics for both toxic and non-toxic prompts.
It is worth noting the impact of the prompts scores in the separation of results. Scenario 3 shows
results with the same toxicity deﬁnitions for both generations and prompts, i.e. if we scored gen-
erations and prompts at the same time. When comparing to scenario 2, toxicity metrics increase,
especially for toxic prompts. This indicates that maintaining the published prompts scores may
lead authors and readers to think models are less toxic than they are would be if both prompts and
generations followed the same toxicity deﬁnition.
3.2.1
Impact on Living Benchmarks
The RealToxicityPrompts is one of the evaluation scenarios of HELM4. The Holistic Evaluation
of Language Models is “a living benchmark that aims to improve the transparency of language
4https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/?group=real_toxicity_prompts
6

models” (Liang et al., 2022). When published, the benchmark contained 42 scenarios of evaluation
ran for 30 prominent language models from open, limited-access, or closed sources. It was estimated
that prior to HELM only 17.9% of its core scenarios were used to evaluate models in general, and
some of the benchmarked models did not share any scenario in common (Liang et al., 2022). At
the time of this work, HELM had benchmarked 37 models.
In HELM’s RTP scenario, benchmarked models are conditioned to generate ﬁve continuations for
each of the same 1000 toxic or non-toxic prompts from the dataset. The three previously mentioned
toxicity metrics are reported, Expected Maximum Toxicity, Toxicity Probability, and Toxic
Fraction, their main metric.
As per the RTP protocol, model generations are scored for toxicity with the Perspective API.
However, results are static and are prone to being outdated if the API has been updated since
the model was added to the benchmark.
In Figure 1 we show how the rankings of models in
the benchmark have changed with updated toxicity scores.
Table 5 shows all metrics for both
toxic and non-toxic splits, as well as what the result would be if we had rescored prompts as well.
Particularities of toxicity measurements from the HELM benchmark are available in Appendix D.
The models with the lowest toxicity are not strongly impacted by the rescoring. Cohere’s models
dominate the ﬁrst places of the benchmark for all three metrics, all being consistently within the
top 10 least toxic models. Toxicity metrics for recently added models to the benchmark5 have not
changed, as expected, such as cohere_command-xlarge-beta and cohere_command-medium-beta.
However, the scores of some previously added models changed. For both metrics, the scores that
changed the most were from openai_text-curie-001. The results for the Toxic Fraction and
EMT metrics went down 16% and 10.8%, respectively. Consistently with results from scenario 2 in
the previous section, that model rose in the ranking as rescoring older results usually leads to lower
toxicity scores. For the EMT metric, the model jumped 11 positions, going from 34th to 23rd place.
For Toxic Fraction, it went from position 35 to 23. In total, we had 13 and 18 changes in values
for the Toxic Fraction and EMT metrics which resulted in 24 and 21 rank changes, respectively.
The average absolute diﬀerence of results for all models was 0.018 for Toxic Fraction and 0.041 for
EMT. Detailed results for the Toxic Fraction metric are on Table 3.
These ﬁndings lead to the conclusion that we have not been comparing apples-to-apples due to
subtle changes in the Perspective API scores. These are alarming results as the HELM benchmark
has only been active for close to 6 months at the date of this work.
3.3
Impact on API Changes on Reproducibility of Research Contributions
To understand the possible impacts of API changes on toxicity mitigation research, we replicate
previously published results. We compare diﬀerences in reporting between diﬀerent snapshots of
the Perspective API for both recent (late 2022) and older (up to early 2021) toxicity mitigation
techniques. In total we benchmark six techniques: DAPT (Gururangan et al., 2020), DExperts
(Large) (Liu et al., 2021a), GPT2 (Large) (Radford et al., 2019), GeDi (Krause et al., 2021), PPLM
(Dathathri et al., 2020), UDDIA (TH=40) (Yang et al., 2022). We include a brief description of
each method in the related works section.

positions, going from 35th to 23rd place. Although there have been 24 changes in ranking for this
metric, only 13 models actually had their metric value change, some by small fractions. Less toxic
models are ranked ﬁrst.

Figure 4: Rescored results from UDDIA (Yang et al., 2022). Baseline results were inherited from
DExperts (Liu et al., 2021b). Results from UDDIA accepted to ICLR a couple of months prior to
this paper, have already changed from published work. All of these models were evaluated on a
selection of 10K Non-Toxic prompts, based on their published scores. UDDIA results are from
the model that had lower toxicity.

In Figure 4, we show the published and rescored results from UDDIA (Yang et al., 2022), using
baselines from Liu et al. (2021b). There are two main takeaways from the plot. First, the toxicity
metrics for a technique published a few months prior to this paper have already changed dramat-
ically. As shown in Figure 4, UDDIA’s EMT dropped from 33.2% to 23.6%. We didn’t ﬁnd any
announcements from the Perspective API that would explain such severe diﬀerences. Second, the
toxicity metrics did not change steadily for all models. As shown in Figure 6 from Appendix C, the
min-max normalized results of the scores illustrate the slope coeﬃcient of each line, which allows us
to understand how each mitigation technique responded to diﬀerent Perspective API versions. Al-
though most baseline generations had close to zero variation in perceived toxicity over time in that
ranking, UDDIA and DAPT had inconsistent results. In comparison to other baselines, UDDIA is
now perceived as more toxic, while DAPT is perceived as less toxic than when they were released.
Examining results at diﬀerent points in time can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the trade-oﬀs
of applying such models for toxicity mitigation. As shown by UDDIA’s and DAPT’s non-zero slopes
for normalized metrics, the actual ranking of results may change over time, similarly to what was
reported in section 3.2.1.

Recommendations
In this section, we lay recommendations to improve reproducibility and conﬁdence in results for
applications that rely on black-box APIs for large-scale evaluations, such as toxicity-related research.
In order for these recommendations to be eﬀective, community collaboration and awareness of an
evaluation’s limitations are required elements.
• For API maintainers: version models and notify users of updates consistently. The Perspective
API has a Google group in which they announce API changes6. However, it is not clear what
criteria they use for their posts, as they mention that they cannot notify users of every model
update and that scores may change unannounced7.
• For authors: release model generations, their toxicity scores, and code whenever possible. Add
the date of toxicity scoring for each evaluated model.
• When comparing new toxicity mitigation techniques with results from previous papers: for
sanity, always rescore open-sourced generations. Assume unreleased generations have outdated
scores and are not safely comparable.
• For living benchmarks such as HELM: establish a control set of sequences that is rescored
with Perspective API on every model addition. If the toxicity metrics for that control set
change, all previous models should be rescored. If a model cannot be rescored due to access
restrictions, add a note regarding outdated results or remove the results from that benchmark
version.

extensively discussed (Claerbout & Karrenbach, 1992; Peng, 2011; Plesser, 2018; Cohen et al., 2018;
Tatman et al., 2018; Zhuang et al., 2022). Cohen et al. (2018) deﬁne reproducibility as “a property
of the outcomes of an experiment: arriving - or not - at the same conclusions, ﬁndings or values”.
The authors propose three dimensions of reproducibility: (1) of conclusions, or validity of inductions
made based on results from research; (2) of ﬁndings, a repeatable discovery based on the relationship
between values; and (3) of values measured or calculated. We understand that the lack of divulged
and controllable versioning of black-box APIs directly impacts all these three axes of reproducibility.
Incompatible versions of the API lead to incomparable values and ﬁndings, which leads to biased
conclusions made by authors and readers. We also understand it prevents works evaluated on these
APIs to be of high reproducibility (Tatman et al., 2018). Even though authors release their code,
data, and computational environments, there are no guarantees that the same ﬁndings and values
will be achieved at diﬀerent points in time.
Toxicity detection and evaluation are some of the ﬁrst steps towards safe use and deployment
of language models (Welbl et al., 2021). These are challenging ﬁrst steps, though, because the
perception of toxicity and hate-speech is known to vary among diﬀerent identity groups (Goyal
et al., 2022) and genders (Binns et al., 2017). The quality of human-based toxicity detection is
correlated to the expertise of the annotator (Waseem, 2016) or to being part of the group which was
targeted by the toxic comment (Goyal et al., 2022). However, even experts are prone to generating
biased annotations in this context (Davidson et al., 2019). On the hazards of the task, human-based
toxicity evaluation is known for negatively impacting moderators’ psychological well-being (Steiger
et al., 2021; Dang et al., 2018). On top of that, the ever-larger amounts of data for either content
moderation or dataset curation are often infeasible to be manually annotated. Automatic toxicity
evaluation not only stabilizes processes but also adds consistency in decisions (Jhaver et al., 2019).
Those tools have their own drawbacks, such as outputting higher toxicity scores for non-normative
and minority communities (Sap et al., 2019; Welbl et al., 2021), and exhibiting variations in scores
for paraphrases (Gargee et al., 2022), but act as a low-cost ﬁrst measure of toxicity (Welbl et al.,
2021).
Toxicity mitigation techniques in Language Models can be classiﬁed as 1) decoding-time
methods, where the output distribution is manipulated at the inference stage without modifying
the model parameters; 2) pretraining-based method, where toxic content is ﬁltered out from the
pretraining corpus; and 3) domain-adaptive methods, where the LM is ﬁne-tuned on curated datasets
(Wang et al., 2022). In this work, we benchmark several methods which we brieﬂy describe here.
UDDIA (Yang et al., 2022) rectiﬁes the output distribution by equalizing the dependence of each
token from protected attributes, in this case, race, gender, and toxicity. ‘TH’ stands for the threshold
of their proposed redo mechanism, which controls the detoxiﬁcation-ﬂuency trade-oﬀ. The higher
TH, the smaller the perplexity. DExperts (Liu et al., 2021b) controls the generation of language
models at decoding time through an ensemble of a base LM with experts and anti-experts LMs
ﬁne-tuned on non-toxic and toxic datasets respectively. PPLM (Dathathri et al., 2019) updates
an LM’s hidden representation based on the gradients from a toxicity classiﬁer and requires no
ﬁne-tuning or changes to the base model. In GeDi (Krause et al., 2020), smaller LMs are used as
generative discriminators to guide the next token prediction of a larger LM.

Conclusion
In this work, we present some of the challenges of using black-box APIs in research, speciﬁcally in
the toxicity evaluation of language models. The joint usage of outdated and fresh scores prevents a
fair comparison of diﬀerent techniques over time and leads authors to biased conclusions. That was
showcased with changes in the just-published results from UDDIA (Yang et al., 2022) and the living
benchmark HELM (Liang et al., 2022), which has been adding new models and benchmarking at
diﬀerent times since its release in November 2022. While Perspective API does not announce all
model updates nor allows for API calls with previous model versions, we urge authors to be cautious
when directly comparing to other work. This research would not have been possible without open-
source released continuations (Gehman et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021b; Liang et al., 2022) and the
authors’ collaboration (Yang et al., 2022).

Perspective API
The Perspective API8 is a free tool that uses machine learning models to aid in content moderation.
Given a comment, or text to be scored, the API predicts the perceived impact it may have had
on a conversation. The impact is measured by attributes, a range of emotional concepts such as
toxicity, insult, and profanity9. For each attribute, we get a probability score indicating how likely
it is that the comment contains the given attribute. In this work, we focus on the toxicity attribute,
which is deﬁned as “a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave
a discussion”.

Qualitative evaluation of RTP prompts
Warning: This section contains content that may be oﬀensive or upsetting.
In this section, we qualitatively evaluate changes of RTP prompts’ toxicity scores distribution. In
Figure 5, we observe the WordCloud of prompts that had their toxicity labels change from when
the RTP dataset was released to the rescoring. 232 samples that were previously Non-Toxic are
now Toxic, and approximately 10K that were Toxic are now Non-Toxic. From the WordCloud,

based on the change of toxicity labels in the direction “published →rescored”. Right: Around 200
prompt samples from RTP shifted from Non-Toxic in the released version of RTP to Toxic in the
latest version of the Perspective API. Left: 10K prompt samples from RTP shifted from Toxic in
the released version of RTP to Non-Toxic in the latest version of the Perspective API.
we observe that the Toxic →Non-Toxic shift has been signiﬁcant in samples that contain words
such as ‘black’, ‘sex’, and ‘white’.
In Table 4 we observe prompt samples with the highest absolute diﬀerences of toxicity from when
the dataset was released to today. For the Non-Toxic →Toxic scenario, the highest diﬀerences
in toxicity scores seem to be for sequences that contain slurs. On the other hand, for the Toxic
→Non-Toxic scenario, higher changes in scores are seen in prompts that contain non-American
words, names, and regions, as well as samples with technical jargons such as ‘IoT’, ‘Bitcoin’ and
‘Anthropods’.

gives insights into the variability of metrics computed with diﬀerent versions of the Perspective
API. Annotations in the image are the slope of each line.
Aggregated toxicity metrics’ rate of
variation (slope) was not consistent across models. Left: For the EMT metric, UDDIA and DAPT
are now perceived as more and less toxic than when released, respectively, while other baseline
models are constant.
Right: For the TP metric, DAPT’s perceived toxicity variation is more
pronounced when compared to other models. Unnormalized metrics are shown in Figure 4.

HELM
In Table 5 HELM v0.2.2 results are displayed side-by-side with their versions with Rescored Gen-
erations (RG) and Rescored Generations and Prompts (RGP) with Perspective API in April 2023.
Benchmarked model names were scraped from HELM’s website. Prompts continuations and metric
results were downloaded with aid of these model names.
D.1
Toxicity Measurement Details
At the time of replication of results, several diﬀerences were found between HELM and the regular
RTP protocol for toxicity measurement, meaning that HELM toxicity results are not comparable to
research work that closely followed the RTP protocol. The particularities of the HELM benchmark
for toxicity measurements are:
• For each prompt 5 continuations are generated instead of 25 as in the RTP framework.
• Top-p and top-k are 1 on the default benchmark API requests. If k takes precedence over p
on a given model’s API, models generate 5 continuations that are most likely the same.
• Toxic fraction is computed for unique text instances.
If there are 5 textually equal toxic
completions they count as 1, but they’re still divided by 5 instances in total.
17

• RTP uses the summaryScore from Perspective API, while HELM uses the ﬁrst spanScore.
The summaryScore are results for the whole sequence. The spanScores are results for relevant
sections of a sequence as detected by the Perspective API.
