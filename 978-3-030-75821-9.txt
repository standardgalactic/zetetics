The Emergence, Complexity and Computation (ECC) series publishes new
developments, advancements and selected topics in the ﬁelds of complexity,
computation and emergence. The series focuses on all aspects of reality-based
computation approaches from an interdisciplinary point of view especially from
applied sciences, biology, physics, or chemistry. It presents new ideas and
interdisciplinary insight on the mutual intersection of subareas of computation,
complexity and emergence and its impact and limits to any computing based on
physical limits (thermodynamic and quantum limits, Bremermann’s limit, Seth
Lloyd limits…) as well as algorithmic limits (Gödel’s proof and its impact on
calculation, algorithmic complexity, the Chaitin’s Omega number and Kolmogorov
complexity, non-traditional calculations like Turing machine process and its
consequences,…) and limitations arising in artiﬁcial intelligence. The topics are
(but not limited to) membrane computing, DNA computing, immune computing,
quantum computing, swarm computing, analogic computing, chaos computing and
computing on the edge of chaos, computational aspects of dynamics of complex
systems (systems with self-organization, multiagent systems, cellular automata,
artiﬁcial life,…), emergence of complex systems and its computational aspects, and
agent based computation. The main aim of this series is to discuss the above
mentioned topics from an interdisciplinary point of view and present new ideas
coming from mutual intersection of classical as well as modern methods of
computation. Within the scope of the series are monographs, lecture notes, selected
contributions from specialized conferences and workshops, special contribution
from international experts.

Preface
Chaos theory for three-dimensional autonomous systems has been intensively and
extensively studied since the time of Edward N. Lorenz in the 1960s, and the theory
has become quite mature today. However, some of the recent ﬁndings reveal that
the complexity and richness of this subject are far beyond our wildest imagination.
Recently, a great deal of interest in a new classiﬁcation of attractors, proposed by
Leonov and Kuznetsov, has emerged from various scientiﬁc and engineering
communities. According to this new classiﬁcation, there is a new kind of attractors
named “hidden attractors” besides the conventional self-excited attractors. The term
“hidden attractor” refers to the fact that the attractor is not associated with any
unstable equilibrium and thus is invisible in simulations, because it may occur in a
tiny region of the parameter space and has a small basin of attraction in the phase
space. From a computational standpoint, it requires speciﬁc numerical methods to
ﬁnd the presence of such hidden attractors.
Hidden attractors have signiﬁcant importance in both theory and practice. For
example, there is a connection between multistability and hidden attractors; systems
with only one stable equilibrium point can generate hidden chaotic attractors;
hidden attractors allow unexpected and potentially disastrous responses to pertur-
bations in a certain structure like a bridge or an airplane wing, and so on. Studying
multistability and hidden attractors, therefore, is of extreme importance, which may
reveal novel phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, such as non-Shilnikov
type chaos, coexistence of different types of attractors, and spontaneous symmetry
breaking in chaotic systems.
The aim of this book is to collect new articles from experts and active
researchers to present their recent ﬁndings and progress in this new area of scientiﬁc
research, including both theoretical advances and potential applications.

X. Wang et al.
Ever since its discovery in 1963, the Lorenz system has been a paradigm of chaos
and the Lorenz attractor has become an emblem of chaos. Lorenz himself thus has
been marked by history as an icon of chaos theory.
System (1) is the most typical chaotic system with only two quadratic terms in its
nonlinearity, which is very simple in the algebraic structure and yet is fairly complex
in the dynamical behavior. The observation of these two seemingly contradictory
aspects of the Lorenz system thereby triggered a great deal of interest from the
scientiﬁccommunitytoseekclosely-relatedLorenz-likesystems,spurredbyavariety
of motivations from different perspectives.
1.2
Rössler System
Otto Rössler [30, 31] designed his chaotic system in 1976. The chaotic Rössler
system was found to be quite useful in modeling equilibrium in chemical reactions.
The system is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −y −z
˙y = x + ay
˙z = −b + z(x −c)
(2)
which is chaotic when a = 0.20, b = 0.20, c = 5.7.
Two types chaotic attractors were found from system (2): one is a single lobe
chaotic attractor (spiral-type), and the other is a more complicated chaotic attractor
(screw-type) [9, 36].
1.3
Chua’s Circuit
The genesis of Chua’s circuit was reported by Leon O. Chua and his colleagues right
after Lorenz and Rössler, as the ﬁrst circuit-implementable electronic system, known
as Chua’s circuit [26, 33]. Chua’s circuit is considered an ideal paradigm for research
on chaos by means of laboratory experiments and computer simulations, because it
admits an adequate model for circuit implementation. In the simplest case, Chua
system read as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = α(−x + y −h(x))
˙y = x −y + z
˙z = −βy
(3)
where the nonlinear function h(x) has the form:
h(x) = m1x + 1
2(m0 −m1)(|x + 1| −|x −1|) ,

Introduction
5
which is chaotic when α = 10.0, β = 14.87, m0 = −1.27, m1 = −0.68.
Numerical analysis has veriﬁed that Chua’s circuit could exhibit several distinct
routes to chaos with a double-scroll chaotic attractor. There are three visible equilibria
of the saddle-focus type, which is in sharp distinction with most known attractors of
three-dimensional systems.
1.4
Chen System
To investigate whether the discovery of Lorenz system was just a lucky incident or
there actually exist other closely related systems around it, many researchers had
made further endeavor in the pursuit. In 1999, Chen [4, 37] gave a deﬁnite answer
to this question by applying an engineering feedback anti-control approach, which
could intentionally yield many chaotic systems. The coined chaotic system was lately
referred to as the Chen system by others. It is in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −z)
˙y = (c −a)x + cy −xz
˙z = −bz + xy
(4)
which is chaotic when a = 35, b = 3, c = 28.
Thereafter, it has been veriﬁed that the attractor in this system (4) exists [46],
and it displays even more sophisticated dynamical behaviors than the Lorenz system
[45].
Connection between Lorenz and Chen Systems
It is also interesting to recall a uniﬁed chaotic system [24], which was constructed to
connect both the Lorenz system and the Chen system. This uniﬁed chaotic system is
by nature a convex combination of the two systems, and is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = (25α + 10)(y −z)
˙y = (28 −35α)x + (29α −1)y −xz
˙z = −α+8
3 z + xy
(5)
Note that
• When α = 0, the system (5) is the Lorenz system.
• When α = 1, the system (5) is the Chen system.
• For any value of α in the interval (0,1), the system remains to be chaotic.

X. Wang et al.
Sprott Systems
Besides the above classical chaotic systems, there are many other similar or related
chaotic systems reported [1, 6, 7, 23, 25, 27, 39, 42–44]. It is worthwhile to refer to
the nineteen Sprott systems, listed in Table 1 [34], some of which will be repeatedly
referred to in the sequel and all of which are algebraically simpler than any of the
systems that were previously known.
Beyond the Classical Chaotic Systems
To this end, despite all these exciting discoveries and fruitful results, the very essential
and important question for chaos theory remains open:
What is the fundamental generating mechanism of chaos?
2
Šil’nikov Theory
To understand what types of systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, while for what
types of systems this may not be impossible, a theorem referred to as the “Šil’nikov
theorem” [32] is widely used. This theorem gives a proof to the situation where a
three-dimensional hyperbolic system can generate self-excited chaos. It states that If
a three-dimensional hyperbolic system has a homoclinic (or heteroclinic) orbit con-
necting its equilibriums, and if its characteristic eigenvalues satisfy certain inequal-
ities, then the system will have a Smale horseshoe attractor and in this sense it
is chaotic. For the present concern of chaos, a local C1-linearization theorem of
Hartman-Grobman [10] and a hyperbolicity criterion [11, 12] are applicable to the
non-wandering part of the Smale horseshoe [3].
Since it is important to make this general question approachable, our ﬁrst step
is to focus on the dynamical systems described by a set of simple, mostly three-
dimensional, autonomous ordinary differential equations with only one or two
quadratic terms. Notice that, although limited to such simplest cases, the complexity
and richness of the subject are still beyond our wildest imagination in general. This
book attempts to “see a world in a grain of sand,” and discusses chaotic systems from
algebraic, geometric and analytical perspectives.
In the next chapter, the Šil’nikov theorem will be introduced and described in
detail, its limitations will be discussed.

Chaos beyond Šil’nikov
As mentioned above, for the three-dimensional hyperbolic type of chaotic systems,
a commonly-used criterion for proving the existence of chaos is the Šil’nikov theory.
However, this theorem offers only a sufﬁcient condition, therefore it does not rule
out the possibility for chaos to exist in many other systems.
Moreover, according to the Hartman-Grobman theorem, mathematically the local
behaviors of a dynamical system in the neighborhood of a hyperbolic equilibrium
point is quantitatively the same as the behavior of its linearized version near this
equilibrium point. No eigenvalues of the linearized system with real parts equal
to zero are considered by the theorem. Therefore, likewise it does not imply any
dynamical behaviors in the domains far from the equilibria. As such, chaotic behavior
in such domains still needs to be further investigated.
After getting rid of the shackles of the Šil’nikov criterion, one can immediately
open up a new horizon, where a variety of new chaotic systems beyond Šil’nikov
might exist and be found.
The journey of exploring various new chaotic systems, beyond Šil’nikov, began
from 2012 when Wang and Chen [38] found a new interesting system that has one
and only one stable equilibrium, by modifying the Sprott E system. A systematic
search for similar chaotic systems with one stable equilibrium was pursued by Sprott

and his colleagues later [25]. Thereafter, non-Šil’nikov type chaotic systems have
been extensively studied by many others [13, 28, 29, 40, 41].
A variety of non-Šil’nikov type chaotic systems with no equilibria, a line of equi-
libria, a surface of equilibria, and even any desired number of equilibria, will be
introduced and studied in the following chapters. By means of Lyapunov exponents,
fractional dimensions, positive entropy, continuous broad frequency spectrums and
bifurcation diagrams, the dynamical properties of these systems with hidden attrac-
tors will be analyzed in various details.

Hidden Attractors and Multi-Stability
4.1
Hidden Attractors
The attractors of the above-mentioned chaotic systems are of great interest and a
new category of attractors has recently been characterized, as “hidden attractors”
besides the conventional self-excited attractors. The term hidden attractor refers to
the scenario where the attractor is not associated with any unstable equilibrium point
and is often invisible in simulations. Because it may occur in a tiny region of the
parameter space and have a small basin of attraction in the phase space. The concept
and mathematical deﬁnition of hidden attractors were ﬁrst introduced by Leonov and
Kuznetsov [21, 22]. From a computational standpoint, it requires speciﬁc numerical
methods to identify the presence of such hidden attractors [2, 5, 19, 20, 35]. Hid-
den attractors have signiﬁcant importance in both theory and practice. For example,
systems with only one stable equilibrium point can also generate hidden attractors,
quite surprisingly from a theoretical point of view, and hidden attractors permit unex-
pected and potentially disastrous responses to perturbations in a certain structure like
a bridge or an airplane wing, from a practical point of view [8, 17]. The classiﬁcation
of attractors as self-exited or hidden ones was a fundamental premise for the emer-
gence of the theory of hidden oscillations, which represents the modern development
of Andronov’s theory of oscillations [14, 18]. The analysis of hidden oscillations,
regarding their absence or presence as well as location, requires developing special
analytical and numerical methods. It is key to determining the exact boundaries of
the global stability, parts of which can be classiﬁed as trivial (i.e., determined by
local bifurcations) or as hidden (i.e., determined by non-local bifurcations and by
the birth of hidden oscillations) [18]–[15].
4.2
Multi-Stability
Referring to the properties of hidden attractors, it is easy to notice that there is a
connection between multi-stability and hidden attractors. Multi-stability exists in

10
X. Wang et al.
almost all scientiﬁc and technological ﬁelds, such as physics, chemistry, mechanics,
lasers, biological systems, lactose utilization networks, and even the Greenland ice
sheet. Thus, it is of great importance since it poses potential threats and damages to
practical engineering applications.
Most higher-dimensional systems, and even some lower-dimensional ones with
multiple nonlinearities, often have coexisting attractors within their separate attract-
ing basins. Therefore, studying multi-stability and hidden attractors is of extreme
importance, which may reveal novel phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems,
such as Non-Šil’nikov type of chaos, coexistence of different types of chaotic attrac-
tors, and spontaneous symmetry breaking in chaotic systems.
Encouraged by the recent research progress, a variety of new discoveries of chaotic
systems with hidden attractors will be introduced in this book. The multi-stability
of chaotic systems is analyzed from the perspectives of observation, designs and
detections. Along with the introduction of such new and interesting chaotic systems,
chaos control, identiﬁcation and symmetry breaking, circuit implementation as well
as some engineering applications will be presented and discussed.

Organization of the Book
This book can roughly be divided into the following ﬁve parts.
5.1
Classical Šil’nikov Chaos
The ﬁrst part is about the background and motivation of this book, and an introduction
of the classical Šil’nikov chaos theory.
Chapter 2 discusses a useful analytical tool—the “Šil’nikov theorem”. This
chapter analyzes the complex dynamics in the neighborhood of a homoclinic loop
to a saddle-focus, or the dynamics in the neighborhood of a heteroclinic loop of
the simple type. The simplest form of the Šil’nikov theorem for three-dimensional
autonomous hyperbolic systems, as well as the basic concepts and properties related
to the Šil’nikov theory, will be discussed. This chapter provides an analytical back-
ground of the basic chaos theory, which will be useful throughout the whole book.
The rest of the book is organized as follows.
5.2
Chaotic Systems with Various Equilibria
The second part of the book mainly investigates the relationships between chaos and
equilibrium points, which includes ﬁve chapters.

Introduction
11
These chapters study a fundamental problem in the chaos theory—the relationship
between the global dynamic behavior of the system and the number and type of its
equilibrium points—what kind of equilibrium characteristics of a dynamical system
may produce chaos? The traditional Šil’nikov type of chaos relies on the unstable
equilibrium point(s) of the system. Homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic orbits based
on the unstable equilibrium point(s) are necessary for the existence of chaos in the
system. This part reviews most of the recently found new chaotic systems with
structures beyond the traditional Šil’nikov framework. The focus is on the relatively
simple three-dimensional autonomous quadratic systems.
Chapter 3 discusses a few simple three-dimensional autonomous quadratic sys-
tems with only one, or more than one stable equilibrium point. These new systems
are of a non-hyperbolic type, for which the Šil’nikov homoclinic criterion is inap-
plicable. Having positive Lyapunov exponents, fractional dimensions, continuous
broad frequency, and period-doubling routes, these systems are chaotic, which is a
striking discovery.
Chapter 4 discusses chaotic ﬂows without equilibria. Neither homoclinic nor het-
eroclinic orbits exist in such systems, thus it is also inapplicable by the Šil’nikov
theorem. Since chaotic behavior can still be observed in the phase space for such
systems, hidden attractors are investigated mainly via numerical simulations.
Chapters5 and 6 introduce an attractive topic of ﬁnding three-dimensional chaotic
systems with an inﬁnite number of equilibria. Chapter 6 illustrates chaotic systems
with a curve of equilibria, and the relation between its properties and the complex
dynamics. Despite the fact that the basin of attraction in such a system has an inter-
section with the equilibria in some portions, an inﬁnite number of the remaining
equilibria are still located outside the basin of attraction, due to the essential "hid-
den” feature. This Chapter contains three parts: chaos with lines of equilibria, chaos
with closed-curves of equilibria, and chaos with open-curves of equilibria. Chapter 6
describes some rare three-dimensional chaotic ﬂows with surfaces of equilibria and
presents a systematic method for ﬁnding them.
Chapter 7 shows how to construct a chaotic system that can have any preassigned
number of equilibria and how the number of equilibria determines the shapes of the
chaotic attractors. Two effective approaches are introduced and discussed.
5.3
Chaotic Systems with Various Components
After reviewing and discussing the aforementioned new chaotic systems, in simple
three-dimensional autonomous quadratic forms with various types of equilibria, the
next part of the book studies new chaos in more general and more complex systems
both theoretically and numerically, with potential applications discussed. These var-
ious types of systems include hyperchaotic systems (from three dimensions to higher
dimensions), fractional systems (from integer order to fractional order), jerk systems
(from lower-order to higher-order ordinary differential equation), and memristor
systems (from mathematical equations to physical circuit systems).

12
X. Wang et al.
These different types of systems are more complex than the simple three-
dimensional autonomous systems discussed above. They are of great importance
in both theory and application. It will be shown that these systems have hidden
attractors and multi-stabilities in various forms.
Chapter8 summarizes some four-dimensional hyperchaotic systems with hidden
attractors, while the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not intersect with
a sufﬁciently small domain of any equilibrium. Various such hyperchaotic systems
will be introduced, with no equilibria, limited equilibria, a curve of equilibria, or a
surface of equilibria, respectively.
Chapter9 applies the fractional calculus to chaotic systems and obtains fractional-
order systems that still exhibit chaos. The Riemann-Liouville derivative and the
Caputo derivative are most widely used. Through some manipulations, both three-
dimensional and four-dimensional chaotic systems can be recast to fractional-order
forms. The sample systems with hidden attractors are also of great importance as the
fractional-order systems without equilibria or with other cases of the equilibria. It is
shown that, by utilizing a new control scheme consisting of a single state variable, a
fractional-order system with a stable equilibrium point can be stabilized.
Chapter10 combines chaotic systems with circuit implementation. A memristive
system with multi-stability and a hidden attractor is presented and discussed.
Chapter11 discusses the simplest explicit third-order ordinary differential equa-
tion in the “jerk” form, which exhibits chaos. The term “jerk” represents the time
derivative of acceleration in physics. Such a system is considered as being in the
simplest form of three-dimensional dissipative systems with quadratic nonlinearities
that can generate chaos. A systematic method for constructing such a jerk system is
introduced. Then, a hyper-jerk system, coexistence of multiple attractors, and a jerk
system with hidden attractors are investigated.
5.4
Multi-Stability in Various Systems with Different
Characteristics
The fourth part mainly studies multi-stability.
Hidden attractors often coexist in more than one type. Even in the ﬁrst-found
example of chaotic system with only one stable equilibrium point, there are several
attractors of different types. The equilibrium point is stable, therefore it is a point
attractorofdimensionzero.Chaoticattractorsareakindofstrangeattractorstypically
having dimensions between 2 and 3. In this system, a periodic solution is also found
to be attractive, thus it is a one-dimensional attractor. So, including the chaotic one,
there are three coexisting attractors of different dimensions in this system.
In the study of multi-stability properties, the multi-stability of symmetric systems
is particularly interesting, because the symmetry of the system equations makes the
system dynamics have some kinds of natural symmetry. If there is only one chaotic
attractor in this kind of system, its attraction domain is symmetrical and its attractor is

Introduction
13
also symmetrical, such as the familiar Lorenz and Chen systems. But, if such a system
has multi-stability, e.g., with multiple attractors, they often appear in symmetric pairs,
but each attractor itself is not symmetrical.
Hidden attractors are closely related to multi-stability. The following chapters dis-
cuss multi-stability, including multi-stability in symmetric systems, multi-stability
in asymmetric systems, multi-stability in conditionally symmetric systems, multi-
stability in self-reproducing systems, and investigate the issue of multi-stability
detection.
Chapter12 describes different regimes of multi-stability in symmetric chaotic
systems, including coexisting symmetric and/or symmetric pairs of strange attractors
in three-dimensional chaotic systems, and coexisting symmetric pairs of strange
attractors with tori in a four-dimensional hyperchaotic system.
Chapter13 describes multi-stability in asymmetric dynamical systems. As a typ-
ical example, coexisting asymmetric strange attractors or limit cycles or even a mix-
ture of chaotic and periodic orbits are found from the Rössler system. Additional
feedback or extra dimension may destroy the symmetry of the dynamical structure
and, therefore, hatch the coexisting asymmetric attractors.
Chapter14 describes multi-stability in conditional symmetric dynamical systems.
Conditional symmetry represents a special structure, which stands in the line of asym-
metry but provides a new possibility for hosting coexisting symmetric attractors. In
this case, the polarity balance is retored by the offset boosting of some of dimensions.
Typically, the absolute value function or a trigonometric function can provide a polar-
ity reversal under the offset boosting of the corresponding variable. A couple of new
cases with conditional symmetry are found by an exhaustive computer search. Mis-
matched offset boosting results in asymmetric coexisting attractors because of the
unbalanced polarity. From this point of view, conditional symmetry as a new struc-
ture may bridge symmetry and asymmetry together, reﬂecting the polarity balance
of the variables in a dynamical system.
Chapter15 describes multi-stability in self-reproducing systems. Offset boosting
is a direct approach for moving an attractor in the phase space. When a periodic
function is introduced into any dimension, the corresponding system becomes a self-
reproducing one exhibiting inﬁnitely distributed attractors. One-dimensional, two-
dimensional and three-dimensional inﬁnitely many chaotic or hyperchaotic attrac-
tors are obtained by periodically offset boosting from the initial conditions when
a trigonometric function is introduced and a suitable period is set to the underly-
ing system. Self-reproducing systems, therefore, represent general multi-stability
for hosting countably inﬁnitely many similar attractors with the same Lyapunov
exponent spectrum.
Chapter16 discusses the detection of multi-stability. Two basic methods for multi-
stability detection are described, based on amplitude control and offset boosting,
respectively. For a multi-stable system, basins of attraction are consequently linearly
scaled or offset boosted, leaving a chance for a ﬁxed initial condition to visit various
basins of attraction. Furthermore, the method for extracting independent amplitude
control is demonstrated based on the Sprott B system. Offset boostable chaotic sys-
tems are found via exhaustive computer search. As a result, when the initial condition

14
X. Wang et al.
goes through different basins of attraction triggering corresponding oscillations or
dropping into a ﬁxed point, the Lyapunov exponent spectrum shows random hopping
for the fractional structure of the attraction region, which gives a ﬂag for detecting
multi-stable states.
5.5
Various Theoretical Advances and Potential Applications
This part is a collection of chapters presenting very recent achievements and progress
in the concerned area of scientiﬁc research, including both theoretical advances and
potential applications.
Chapter17 describes a special class of delay impulsive differential equations with
the coefﬁcient of the delayed term given by a nilpotent matrix of index 2.
Chapter18 discusses the possibility of mutual fusion of evolutionary algorithms,
and hidden attractors identiﬁcation and their synthesis. This chapter presents numer-
ical demonstration of identiﬁcation of the basin of attraction for hidden attractors
(via evolutionary algorithms) as well as the possibility of its synthesis and design.
In this chapter, there are also discussions on a few research questions, joined with
biologically inspired algorithms, chaos theory, and hidden attractors.
Chapter19 presents a new three-dimensional autonomous chaotic system with a
sine trigonometric function, which can display hidden attractors. The fundamental
dynamical properties of the system are discovered by calculating its equilibrium
points as well as using phase portraits, Poincaré map, bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov
exponents, and Kaplan–Yorke fractional dimension.
Chapter20 discusses the ﬁnding of a new four-dimensional hyperchaotic system
with inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria, or without equilibria, which is obtained by
adding a linear feedback controller to the ﬁrst equation of a three-dimensional chaotic
system.
Chapter21 studies piecewise-afﬁne systems and investigates the existence of
homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycles, and extends the Šil’nikov theory to the
chaos theory for a class of piecewise-smooth systems.
Chapter 22 proposes a new three-dimensional chaotic system with inﬁnitely many
equilibria located on a line. Investigation of dynamical properties of the system shows
its potential to have various complex behaviors. Circuit implementation declares the
feasibility of the system in real applications.
Chapter23 analyzes a simple chaotic system. In some ranges of its parameters,
this system has no equilibria, which means that it has hidden attractors. It is found
that this system has two unstable equilibria located in other ranges of its parameter
values.
Chapter24 introduces a new three-dimensional chaotic system. The nonlinear
terms of the system are quadratic, while there is no any linear term. Interestingly,
the system has eight symmetric equilibrium points, which are located at the vertexes
of a cube. Bifurcation analysis and circuit implementation of the system are also
reported.

Introduction
15
Chapter25 introduces the globally attracting hidden attractors. Since not only is
every initial condition in their basin of attraction, but every initial condition lies on
the attractor, and thus they could hardly be less hidden. Such attractors have been
known and studied long before the recent hoopla about hidden attractors, and they
have other remarkable properties to be recounted here.
5.6
Discussions and Perspectives
The ﬁnal part of the book presents some discussions of the origin of multi-stability
in nonlinear dynamic systems, and the physics implication.
Chapter26 discusses spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) which, in contrast
to explicit symmetry breaking, is a spontaneous process in a system governed by a
symmetrical dynamic procedure, ending up in an asymmetrical state. Thus, the sym-
metry of the equations is not reﬂected by the individual solutions, but is reﬂected by
the symmetrical coexistence of asymmetrical solutions. The SSB provides a way of
understanding the complexity of nature without renouncing the fundamental symme-
try, which leads to the belief or preference of symmetric-to-asymmetric fundamental
physical laws. Many illustrations of SSB are discussed from daily life scenario to
mathematical nonlinear dynamic systems.
Chapter27 discusses multi-ability of chaotic systems in reference to symmetry,
diversity and practical theorems. The premise of multi-stability is that there is a
uniﬁed kinematic equation governing the whole state space, so multi-stability does
not emphasize on the diversity caused by different laws. In addition, the Noether
and Goldstone theorems are introduced to promote a better understanding of the
vacuum and the ground state of a multi-scroll system, as well as the mathematical
representation of the Higgs mechanism.

Dynamics in the Neighborhood of a Homoclinic Loop to a
Saddle-Focus
The possibility of the existence of transitive invariant compact sets, which contain
a countable set of rough periodic motions, is one of the fundamental singularities
of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. Although some examples of such systems
have been shown by Poincare, Birkhoff, Morse, and some other researchers, the
conceptual foundation of systems with a countable set of rough periodic motions was
laid in the works of Smale, based on the idea of roughness presented by Andronov and
Pontrjagin. In 1961, Smale [1] ﬁrst introduced an example of a rough diffeomorphism
on a two-dimensional sphere, having an invariant subset that is homeomorphic to a
topological Bernoulli process with two symbols. On the basis of the construction of
this diffeomorphism, Smale developed a construction, which is now known as the
“Smale horseshoe”.
In Ref.[2], Šil’nikov approached a homoclinic loop to a saddle-focus with a
positive saddle value, and found a countable set of periodic motions of the saddle
type. He discovered that a map T , to which the problem reduces, has a countable
number of “Smale horseshoes”.
The simplest case corresponds to a three-dimensional autonomous system that has
a homoclinic loop to an equilibrium, with one positive eigenvalue and two complex
conjugate eigenvalues with negative real parts. By placing such an equilibrium at the
origin O(0, 0, 0), the three-dimensional system can be written in the form

where P, Q, R are smooth functions, along with their ﬁrst-order partial derivatives,
vanishing at the origin O. The eigenvalues of the equilibrium at the origin of this
system are λ > 0 and λ1,2 = ρ ± iω, where ρ < 0 and ω > 0. The unstable manifold
W u is a curve, which is tangent to the z-axis. The stable manifold W s is a two-
dimensional surface, which is tangent to the plane z = 0. If one restricts the system
to its stable manifold W s, then the equilibrium O will be a stable focus. This is why
the equilibrium O is called a saddle-focus in the full system.
Under the assumption that there is a homoclinic orbit to the saddle-focus O of
the above system, the following theorem was established in Ref.[2].
Theorem 2.1 Reference[2] Let the saddle value λ + ρ be positive. Then, in any
arbitrarily small neighborhood of the homoclinic loop to the saddle-focus, there
exist inﬁnitely many saddle periodic orbits.
A countable set of three-dimensional “Smale horseshoes” was demonstrated for
a four-dimensional system with a saddle-focus equilibrium in Ref.[3].
In Ref.[4], which employs a countable set of symbols to describe the structure of
a neighborhood of a homoclinic loop to a saddle-focus, it presents an extension of
the results in Refs.[2] and [3] to systems of arbitrary dimensions.
Consider a system of m + n-dimensional differential equations,

where A is an m-dimensional matrix with eigenvalues λ1, · · · , λm lying to the left of
the imaginary axis, and B is an n-dimensional matrix with eigenvalues γ1, · · · , γn
lying to the right of the imaginary axis. Here, f (x, y) and g(x, y) are analytic func-
tions in some regions of Rm+n, and these functions and their ﬁrst derivatives vanish
at x = y = 0. Without loss of generality, assume that

Let W s be an m-dimensional stable manifold with a saddle point O, and let W u be
an n-dimensional unstable manifold.

where W s
M and W u
M are the tangent spaces to manifolds W s and W u, respectively, at
the point M ∈Γ . Furthermore, assume that

Šil’nikov Theorem
21
1. The eigenvalues γ1 and γ2 are complex conjugate, and Reγ1 < −Reλ j, j =
1, . . . , m.
2. Reγ1 < Reγi, i = 3, . . . , n. Under this assumption, almost all trajectories which
lie in W u will be improper O−-trajectories, and as t →−∞they will be tangent
to a two-dimensional conducting plane.
3. Γ converges to the saddle point O as t →−∞, being tangent to the conducting
plane.
4. There is a certain quantity δ ̸= 0 (see Lemma 3.2 of [4]).
Consider the set of doubly inﬁnite sequences,
Ω(ρ) = (. . . , ji, ji+1, · · · ),
(2)
consisting of the symbols 0, 1, 2, . . ., and for arbitrary adjacent indices in (2) satis-
fying the condition that ji+1 < ρji for some ρ > 1. Under the above assumptions,
the following theorem can be obtained.
Theorem 2.2 Reference[4] In any extended neighborhood of the saddle-focus of the
system (1), which satisﬁes conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4, there exists a subset of trajectories
that is in one-to-one correspondence with the set Ω(ρ), where ρ does not exceed
(−Reλ1)Reγ −1
1 .
Remark 2.1 Under other general assumptions, theconditionthat thecomplexeigen-
values with real parts being the smallest in absolute value is necessary for the exis-
tence of periodic motions. Otherwise, under the assumption that γ1 is a real root, as
shown in Ref.[5], generally an arbitrary neighborhood of Γ does not contain periodic
motions, and by small perturbations to Γ only one periodic motion can be obtained.
Remark 2.2 For the case of n = 2, conditions 2 and 3 are automatically satisﬁed.
The method for proving the Theorem2.2 is analogous to the method for proving
the Poincaré-Birkhoff problem [6], which constructs a map T whose domain of
deﬁnition is representable as a countable union of mutually disjoint domains where
T is of saddle type.
With the help of a local C1-linearization theorem by Hartman [7] and the hyperbol-
icity criteria [8, 9], which apply in particular to the non-wandering set of a horseshoe
[10], Tresser [11] improved (at least in dimension 3 ) Theorems2.1 and 2.2 obtained
by Šil’nikov for certain real analytic vector ﬁelds, as further discussed below.
Theorem 2.3 Reference[11] Consider the system
˙x = ρx −ωy + P(x, y, z),
˙y = ωx + ρy + Q(x, y, z),
˙z = λz + R(x, y, z),
(3)
where P, Q, R are C1,1 functions which, as well as their ﬁrst order partial deriva-
tives, vanish at the origin O = (0, 0, 0). Suppose that there exists a homoclinic orbit

22
Y.-M. Chen
Γ , bi-asymptotic to O, which remains at a ﬁnite distance from any other singularity.
Suppose, at least, that
λ > −ρ > 0.
(4)
Suppose also that θ is a ﬁrst return map correctly deﬁned on a well-chosen piece of
surface π0, and
Σm = {1, · · · , m}Z ,
Σ∗,α =

s = {si}+∞
i=−∞|si ∈Z −{0} and |si+1| ≥|si|
α

.
Then, the following conclusions hold:
(a) for each positive integer m, there exists a map,
hm : Σm →π0,
which is a homeomorphism of Σm onto Om = hm(Σm), such that
θ|Om = hm ◦σ ◦h−1
m ;
(b) the set Om is hyperbolic;
(c) for each real α with 1 ≤α ≤λ/|ρ|, there exists a map,
h∗,α : Σ∗,α →π0,
which is a homeomorphism of Σ∗,α onto O∗,α = h∗,α(Σ∗,α), such that
θ|O∗,α = h∗,α ◦σ ◦h−1
∗,α.
Remark 2.3 In Theorem 2.3, conclusion (c) implies (a). Conclusion (a) is isolated
since (a) and (b) together describe the well-known hyperbolic sets.
Remark 2.4 One of the consequences of (a) and (c) is that any neighborhood of
Γ contains inﬁnitely many periodic orbits of the saddle type, which was the main
conclusion in Refs.[2] and [4], as shown by Theorems2.1 and 2.2.
Remark 2.5 The most direct consequence of Theorem2.3 is that it applies as well
to system (3), but with
−λ > ρ > 0
(5)
to replace the eigenvalues condition (4), since one only has to reverse time to get the
hypotheses of Theorem 2.3.
Remark 2.6 On the contrary, when

Šil’nikov Theorem
23
−ρ > λ > 0 (or ρ > −λ > 0),
(6)
under the hypotheses of Theorem2.3, except that the eigenvalues condition (6) is
used to replace (4), there is no periodic orbit in any neighborhood of Γ if it is chosen
small enough [5].

Dynamics in the Neighborhood of a Heteroclinic Loop of
the Simple Type
Let X ∈R3 be a C1,1 vector ﬁeld and Oi, i = 1, . . . , n, be hyperbolic equilibria of
X. All equilibria Oi are supposed to possess a one-dimensional unstable manifold
W u
Oi and a two-dimensional stable manifold W s
Oi, with
Γi = W u
Oi ∩W s
Oi+1 ̸= ∅,
i = 1, . . . , n,
where the simpliﬁed notation On+i = Oi has been used.
The intersections Γi, i ∈{1, . . . , n} are called heteroclinic connections and the
union
Γ0 =
n
i=1
(Γi ∪Oi)
is called a “heteroclinic loop”.
In the remainder of this section, the following notations and hypotheses will be
used and assumed:
1. W u+
i
= Γi ∪Oi, the other part of W u
Oi being denoted by W u−
i
;
2. each Γi is bounded away from all equilibria, except Oi and Oi+1;
3. the vector ﬁeld X has m saddles, with 0 ≤m < n, and for each O j of the saddle
type, the eigenvalues of the linearized ﬂow at O j are
λ j,1 > 0 > λ j,2 > λ j,3;
4. for each saddle-focus Oi, the eigenvalues of the linearized ﬂow at Oi are
λi > 0,
ρi ± iωi with ρi < 0;
5. the non-resonance hypotheses of saddles for ﬂows are satisﬁed, namely,
∀k :
|eλk| ̸= |eλi| · |eλ j|,
|eλi| ≤1 ≤|eλ j|.
(7)
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Saddle of the simple type) Reference[4] Let Γ0 be a heteroclinic loop
joining the equilibria Oi, 1 ≤i ≤n and let O j be a saddle for some j ∈{1, · · · , n}.

24
Y.-M. Chen
Equilibrium O j is said to be of the simple type if W s
O j+1 ∪O j contains a disk, which in
turns contains W u+
O j , and the local part of the strongly stable manifold corresponding
to λ j,3. In the sequel, such a disk, say D j, is assumed to contain O j and O j+1 in
its interior. Each D j generates two half-tubes T±
j and T+
j is referred to the one
that contains the local part of Γ j−1 near O j, which is tangent to the eigenvector
corresponding to λ j,2.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Heteroclinic loop of the simple type) Reference [4] A heteroclinic
loop involving at least one saddle-focus is said to be of the simple type if the following
conditions are satisﬁed:
1. all saddles are of the simple type;
2. for each of them, T+
j contains W u+
j+1; and
3. Γ0 always follows the leading direction in W s
O j near the saddles.
With the above notations and hypotheses, the following theorem about the dynam-
ics in the neighborhood of heteroclinic loop Γ0 of the simple type can be obtained.
Theorem 2.4 Let X be a C1,1 vector ﬁeld in R3, Γ0 be a heteroclinic loop of the
simple type such that all saddles in Γ0 verify the non-resonance conditions (7) [4]s,
and let
p =

Oi is a saddle-focus
	
−λi
ρi

⎞
⎠×
⎛
⎝

O j is a saddle
	
−λ j,1
λ j,2

⎞
⎠.
Then,
1. if p > 1, one has the conclusions of Theorem 2.3, with Σ∗,α replaced by
Σ∗,α
2(n−m−1) and 1 ≤α ≤p; and
2. if p < 1, one has the conclusion of Remark2.6.

Simplest Form of the Šil’nikov Theorem
In this section, based on the above theorems, which are about the dynamics in the
neighborhoods of a homoclinic loop to a saddle-focus and of a heteroclinic loop of
the simple type, in Ref.[12] it presents a tutorial look at the simplest form of the
Šil’nikov Theorem and its various extensions.
Consider the three-dimensional autonomous dynamical system
dx
dt = f (x), t ∈R, x ∈R3,
(8)
where the vector ﬁeld f (x) : R3 →R3 is a C p (p ≥1) function. Let xe be a saddle-
focus equilibrium of system (8), and the eigenvalues of xe be

Šil’nikov Theorem
25
λ,
ρ ± iω,
ρλ < 0, ω ̸= 0.
Theorem 2.5 (Homoclinic Šil’nikov method) Reference[12] Given the three-
dimensional autonomous system (8), where f (x) is a C2 vector ﬁeld on R3. Let
xe be an equilibrium of system (8). Suppose that
1. the equilibrium xe is a saddle-focus with characteristic eigenvalues satisfying the
Šil’nikov inequality
|λ| > |ρ| > 0 ;
(9)
2. there exists a homoclinic orbit Γ based at xe.
Then,
1. the Šil’nikov map deﬁned in a neighborhood of Γ possesses a countable number
of Smale horseshoes in its discrete dynamics;
2. for any sufﬁciently small C1-perturbation g(x) of f (x), the perturbed system
dx
dt = g(x), x ∈R3
(10)
has at least a ﬁnite number of Smale horseshoes in the discrete dynamics of the
Šil’nikov map deﬁned near Γ ;
3. both the original system (8) and the perturbed system (10) exhibit horseshoe
chaos (also known as homoclinic chaos).
Remark 2.7 Function g(x) is a C1-perturbation of f (x), which means that the
norm of the difference g(x) −f (x) and its ﬁrst derivative are sufﬁciently small in a
neighborhood containing Γ .
Remark 2.8 Under the condition (9), one has the eigenvalues condition (4) in The-
orem2.3, or eigenvalues condition (5) in Remark 2.5. Thus, the conclusions of The-
orem 2.3 hold.
Theorem 2.6 (Heteroclinic Šil’nikov method) [12] Given the three-dimensional
autonomous system (8), where f (x) is as in Theorem2.5. Let xe1 and xe2 be two
distinct equilibria of (8). Suppose that
1. both xe1 and xe2 are saddle-foci that satisfy the Šil’nikov inequality
|λi| > |ρi| > 0 (i = 1, 2)
(11)
with the constraints
ρ1ρ2 > 0 or λ1λ2 > 0;
(12)

26
Y.-M. Chen
2. there is a heteroclinic loop Γ0 joining xe1 to xe2 that is made up of two heteroclinic
orbits Γi (i = 1, 2).
Then, the conclusion 1 −3 of Theorem2.5 hold again, with Γ being replaced by Γ0,
equilibrium xe by xei (i = 1, 2), and homoclinic chaos by the corresponding term
heteroclinic chaos.
Remark 2.9 Under the eigenvalues conditions (11) and (12), the number p in The-
orem2.4 is bigger than one. Thus, the ﬁrst conclusion of Theorem 2.4 holds.

Chaotic Systems with Stable Equilibria

Introduction
In this chapter, some three-dimensional autonomous quadratic chaotic systems with
stable equilibria are introduced. The new systems are of non-hyperbolic type, there-
fore the homoclinic Šil’nikov method is inapplicable. Having positive largest Lya-
punov exponents, fractional dimensions, continuous broad frequency spectra and
period-doubling routes, the new systems are indeed chaotic. Several systems pro-
posed by Sprott [1–3], Wang [4], Wei [5–9], Yang [6, 7, 10, 11], and some others
will be introduced as well, providing an overview of such new chaotic ﬂows with
stable equilibria.
2
Motivation
Many early examples of three-dimensional chaotic ﬂows occur in system with one
or more unstable saddle points, which are justiﬁed by the Šil’nikov theorem. A self-
excited attractor deﬁned by Leonov and Kuznetsov [12] is involved in such a system
having a basin of attraction associated with an unstable equilibrium. These systems
are expected to be chaotic in the sense of Šil’nikov [13], allowing homoclinic and
heteroclinic orbits [14].

Although the Šil’nikov theorem ensures horseshoe chaos to exist with a homo-
clinic orbit if its characteristic eigenvalues with negative real parts at the equilibria
satisfy some speciﬁc conditions, it does not rule out the possibility of encountering
chaos in systems with stable equilibria.
According to the Hartman–Grobman theorem, mathematically the local behaviors
of a dynamical system in the neighborhood of a hyperbolic equilibrium point is
qualitatively the same as the behavior of its linearized system near this equilibrium
point. However, it does not cover the domain far from the equilibrium, thus chaotic
behavior in such a domain is still possible, hence needs further investigation.
In the last few years, the concept of hidden attractor was introduced, which is
different from self-excited attractors and is considered to have a basin of attraction
that does not intersect with small neighborhoods of any equilibrium point. In 2008,
Yang and Chen [10] found a three-dimensional system with three ﬁxed points: one
saddle and two stable equilibria. Moreover, a few new chaotic systems with stable
equilibria were discovered by Wei and Yang [6, 11, 15], which can generate strange
attractors not satisfying the Šil’nikov theorem. In 2012, Wang and Chen [4] coined a
new system based on the Sprott E system (see Table 1), referred to as the Wang-Chen
system, which has one and only one stable equilibrium point.
All the above had motivated a great deal of research effort in studying hidden
attractors and chaos in systems with stable equilibria.
3
First Example on Chaos with One Stable Equilibrium
Sprott searched and found 19 distinct simple examples of chaotic ﬂows with quadratic
nonlinearities [1]. Some systems with only one equilibrium are listed in Table 1. In
this table, systems I, J, L, N and R all have only one saddle-focus equilibrium, while
systems D and E both have a degenerate equilibrium.
It is clear that the equilibria of systems D and E are not stable. Nevertheless, it
is quite natural to imagine that a small perturbation to the system may be able to
change such a degenerate equilibrium to a stable one. Therefore, to generate such a
new system, Wang and Chen [4] started from the Sprott E system (see Table 1), having
a degenerate equilibrium E( 1
4, 1
16, 0), with eigenvalues λ1 = −1 and λ2,3 = ±0.5i,
described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz
˙y = x2 −y
˙z = 1 −4x.
(1)
In order to change the stability of its single equilibrium to a stable one, while
preserving its chaotic dynamics, Wang and Chen added a constant control parameter
a to the Sprott E system (see Table 1), so as to form a new system as follows:

With appropriate values of a, system (2) has only one equilibrium point E( 1

16,
−16a), and the stability of this single equilibrium point is fundamentally different
from that of system (1), as can be veriﬁed and compared from the results showed in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Particularly, when a = 0, the system (2) is the Sprott E
system shown in Table 1. System (2) is the revised Sprott E system when a ̸= 0. The
homoclinic Šhi’lnikov method or criterion might be applied to this system to show
the existence of chaos; however, it involves somewhat subtle mathematical analysis
and computations.

By solving the characteristic equation (4), one obtains the Jacobian eigenvalues, as
shown in Table 2, for some chosen values of the parameter a.
In addition, to verify the chaoticity of system (2), its Lyapunov exponents and
Lyapunov dimension are calculated in [4].
The Lyapunov exponents are denoted by Li, i = 1, 2, 3, and ordered as L1 >
L2 > L3. Recall that a system is considered chaotic if L1 > 0, L2 = 0, L3 < 0 with
|L1| < |L3|. It is noted that for this system, the largest Lyapunov exponent decreases
as the parameter a increases from −0.01 to 0.05.
The Lyapunov dimension is deﬁned by

is stable.

Chaotic Systems with Stable Equilibria

Fig. 1 Chaotic attractor with a = 0.006 in Wang-Chen system [4], including 3D views on the x-y
plane, x-z plane and y-z plane
Through the analysis of the largest Lyapunov exponent (positive), and the fact
that the chaotic waveform of y(t) is a continuous broadband spectrum, Wang and
Chen veriﬁed that the new system is indeed chaotic.
Take the case of a = 0.006 as an example. As shown in Table 2, the equilib-
rium of the new system becomes a node-focus when a > 0, therefore the Šhi’lnikov
homoclinic criterion is not applicable to this case. Remarkably, when a = 0.06, three
characteristic values of the Jacobian of the linearized equation, evaluated at the equi-
libria point E0, are: λ1 = −0.96069, λ2,3 = −0.01966 ± 0.50975i. Furthermore,
numerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponents yields
L1 = 0.0489,
L2 = 0,
L3 = −1.0485,
(7)
indicating the existence of chaos in this system with one and only one stable equi-
librium, as shown in Fig.1.
Moreover, the coexistence of point, periodic and strange attractors in the Wang-
Chen system was found by Sprott et al. [2].
As the ﬁrst example of chaos from a system with one stable equilibrium, the
Wang-Chen system is a milestone for ﬁnding or constructing new chaotic systems
with mysterious features of chaos. It was a striking discovery, which motivated
considerable subsequent research and studies.

More Examples of Chaotic Systems with One Stable
Equilibrium
4.1
Wei System
Based on the Sprott E system (see Table 1), Wei and Wang [9] introduced an extended
version of the Wang-Chen system, as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz + h(x)
˙y = x2 −y
˙z = 1 −4x.
(8)
where h(x) = ex2 + f x + g and e, f , g are real parameters. System (8) has only one
equilibrium, E = ( 1
4, 1
16, −e −4 f −16g). Similarly, this system is a revised Sprott
E system, with e = f = g = 0. In addition to the choice of h(x) = g, this Wei system
is also matching with the result proposed by Wang and Chen as the function has the
speciﬁc form of h(x) = ex2 or f x, which both have only one equilibrium:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz + ex2
˙y = x2 −y
˙z = 1 −4x.
(9)
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz + f x
˙y = x2 −y
˙z = 1 −4x.
(10)
By linearizing the system (8) at the equilibrium point E0, the Jacobian matrix is
obtained, as
J =
⎡
⎣
e
2 + f −e −4 f −16g
1
16
1
2
−1
0
−4

⎤
⎦.
Then, the characteristic equation of system (8) is given by
|λI −J| = 0
(11)
According to the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, the real parts of all the roots λ are
negative if and only if
δ1 = 1 −f −e
2 > 0, δ2 =

 	1

By solving these inequalities, one obtains

f < 1 −e
2, e < 2(3 f −4 f 2 + 32g −32 f g)
1 + 4 f + 32g
.
(12)
In addition, the negative Lyapunov exponent spectra of system (8), when f =
−0.1, g = 0.02 and e ∈[−0.4, −0.303), clearly illustrates that −0.015 ≤e < 0.08
is a periodic window; −0.015 ≤e < 0.029 is a period-2 orbit region; 0.029 < e <
0.048 is a period-4 orbit region, and as e increases in the range of 0.048 < e < 0.08,
the orbit of system (8) is attracted into a sink. Hence, the equilibrium point E of
system (8) is asymptotically stable when the above conditions are met.
In addition, a modiﬁed projective synchronization between the extended system
(8) and the Sprott E system (see Table 1) was reported in [9]. Degenerate Hopf
bifurcation, adaptive control, and Lyapunov stability in the extended system (8)
were also studied [16].

Multiple-delayed Wang-Chen System
Wei and Pham [17] created a model of the Wang-Chen system with multiple delays:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz + a + k1x(t −τ1) + k2x(t −τ2)
˙y = x2 −y
˙z = 1 −4x.
(13)
where τi (i = 1, 2) are time delays, and ki (k = 1, 2) are the gains of the time delays
τi (i = 1, 2), respectively.
Clearly, system (13) has one and only one equilibrium
E(x0, y0, z0) =
	1
4, 1
16, −16a −4(k1 + k2)

.
(14)
By linearizing system (13) at the equilibrium point E0, the characteristic equation
with appropriate constraints on the eigenvalues is given by
λ3 + a2λ2 + a1λ + a0 −k1(λ2 + a2λ)e−λτ1 −k2(λ2 + a2λ)e−λτ2 = 0 ,
(15)
where a2 = 1 and a1 = ( 1
4 + 8a + 2k1 + 2k2), a0 = 1
4.
When τ1 = τ2 = 0, Eq.(15) becomes
λ3 + (1 −k1 −k2)λ2 +
	1
4 + 8a + k1 + k2

λ + 1
4 = 0.
(16)
According to the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, Eq.(16) has three roots with negative
real parts under the following condition:

36
X. Wang and G. Chen
1 −k1 −k2 > 0, (1 −k1 −k2)
	1
4 + 8a + k1 + k2

−1
4 > 0.
(17)
Therefore, equilibrium E is an asymptotically stable node or foci-node, when
3 −32a −ϕ(a)
8
< k1 + k2 < 3 −32a −ϕ(a)
8
,
(18)
where ϕ(a) =
√
1024a2 + 320a + 9.
For system (13), its stability and the existence of Hopf bifurcation were deter-
mined, and the direction, stability as well as the period of the bifurcating periodic
solution were analyzed using the normal form method and center manifold theorem
in [17].
The theoretical results and numerical simulations of [17] show that the chaotic
dynamics of system (13) can be controlled by manipulating the time delays. Theo-
retically, when only one equilibrium is asymptotically stable, the chaotic attractor is
converted into a stable state, an unstable periodic orbit or another chaotic attractor
again, if the delay passes through a certain value. Indeed, as the delay increases
further, numerical simulations show that the periodic solution disappears and the
chaotic attractors appear again.
4.3
Lao System
To overcome some limitations of the conventional methods [18–20] for parameter
estimation in various models of chaos, which are caused by the sensitivity of chaos to
initial conditions, Lao [21] used a geometry-based cost function to build a statistical
model on the distribution of the real system attractors in the state space, whereby a
new chaotic system with only one equilibrium was also introduced:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −z
˙y = −x −z
˙z = 2x −1.3y −2z + x2 + z2 −xz.
(19)
There is one equilibrium point at the origin E(0, 0, 0) in the Lao system (19),
with three corresponding eigenvalues:
λ1 = −1.9783,
λ2 = −0.0108 + 0.8106i,
λ3 = −0.0108 −0.8106i.
(20)
Since the three eigenvalues of the characteristic equation contain one negative root
and two imaginary roots with negative real parts, the equilibrium point E is a stable
focus.

Fig. 2 Cross-section of the
basins of attraction of the
two attractors in the x-y
plane at z = 0. Initial
conditions in the white
region lead to unbounded
orbits, those in the red region
lead to the point attractor,
shown by a black dot, and
those in the light blue region
lead to the strange attractor,
shown in cross-section as a
pair of black lines [21]
In addition, the Lyapunov spectrum for the strange attractor was calculated, yield-
ing LE1 = 0.018, LE2 = 0, LE3 = −2.018. Thus, the Lao system (19) is chaotic
with only one stable equilibrium.
Moreover, there exists a point attractor in the basin of attraction of the strange
attractors. The coexistence of these two attractors leads to a cross-section, as shown
in Fig.2, where the cross-section of the strange attractor nearly touches its basin
boundary as is typical for lower-dimensional chaotic ﬂows. Lao also discovered an
interesting phenomenon that, besides the area around the origin, there is another
separate area that converges to the stable equilibrium.
4.4
Kingni System
Kingni [22] introduced a new three-dimensional autonomous system with only one
equilibrium:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −z
˙y = −x −z
˙z = 3x −ay + x2 −z2 −yz + b,
(21)
where a and b are real parameters, assuming that a ̸= 0. The system (21) possesses
only one equilibrium point, E(0, b
a , 0) if a ̸= 0.
The characteristic equation of the system Jacobian at E0 is

38
X. Wang and G. Chen

of the equilibrium point
E(0, b
a , 0) in the parameter
space spanned by a and b.
The light grey area indicates
the region where E(0, b
a , 0)
is asymptotically stable,
while the white area
represents the case where the
conditions on the inequations
(23) are not met, so the
equilibrium point E(0, b
a , 0)
is unstable [22]
λ3 + b
a λ2 −(−3 + a)λ + a = 0.
(22)
According to the Routh–Hurwitz conditions, this equation has all roots with neg-
ative real parts if and only if
A > 0, C > 0, AB −C > 0,
(23)
where A = b
a , B = 3 −a, C = a. By varying a from 0.002 to 3.0, and b from 0 to
20.0, one can obtain the stability boundaries of the equilibrium point E(0, b
a , 0), as
shown by the light grey area in Fig.3. By choosing a = 1.3 and b = 1.01, Kingni
solved the characteristic equation (22) and obtained three eigenvalues:
λ1 = −0.7678519459, λ2,3 = −0.004535565486 ± 1.301158769i .
Therefore, the equilibrium point E(0, 1.01
1.30, 0) becomes a node-focus, therefore
the Kingni system is stable.
4.5
From an Inﬁnite Number of Equilibria to Only One
Stable Equilibrium
As shown by Pham [14], it is possible to construct a new system with one stable
equilibrium from another system with an inﬁnite number of equilibria.
Start with a chaotic ﬂow, LE1, introduced by Jafari and Sprott [23],

Chaotic Systems with Stable Equilibria
39
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = −x −axy −bxz.
(24)
in which a and b are two positive parameters. It is clear that the LE1 system has
inﬁnitely many equilibria:
E(0, 0, z).
Now, by adding a positive control parameter c to the LE1 system, one obtains a
new system
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz + c
˙z = −x −axy −bxz.
(25)
This system has only one equilibrium,
E
	
c, 0, −1
b

.
The Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium E is
JE =
⎡
⎣
0
1
0
−1 −1
b
0
0 −ac −bc
⎤
⎦
(26)
and its characteristic equation is
λ3 +
	
bc + 1
b

λ2 + bc = 0 .
(27)
According to the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion, the equilibrium is stable when
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
bc + 1
b > 0
c + 1 > 0
bc > 0
(bc + 1
b)(c + 1) > bc .
(28)
From Eq.(27), one obtains the eigenvalues
λ1 = −bc, λ2,3 = −0.5 ± 0.866i .
(29)
Hence, one can see that the system (25) has a chaotic attractor as shown in Fig.4,
although it has only one equilibrium.

Systematic Search for Chaotic Systems with One Stable
Equilibrium
5.1
Jerk System
Consider a jerk system with one stable equilibrium for generating chaotic ﬂows,
described by
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = f (x, y, z)
f = a1x + a2y + a3z + a4x2 + a5y2 + a6z2 + a7xy + a8xz + a9yz + a10.
(30)
By solving Eq.(30), one obtains y∗= z∗= 0 as the equilibrium. The eigenvalues
λ must satisfy
λ3 −fzλ2 −fyλ −fx = 0 ,
(31)
in which fx = a1 + 2a4x∗, fy = a2 + a7x∗, and fz = a3 + a8x∗.
Using the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion, to have a stable equilibrium point it
is required that
fz < 0 ,
(32)

Chaotic Systems with Stable Equilibria
41
fy fz + fx > 0 ,
fx < 0 .
By setting y∗= z∗, one obtains
a1x + a4x2 + a10 = 0 ,
(33)
and, for a4 ̸= 0,
x∗
1,2 = (−a1 ±
√
Δ)/2a4 ,
(34)
where Δ = a2
1 −4a4a10.
To obtain an equilibrium, Δ should not be less than 0, while the stability condition
fx < 0 at x∗
1 requires
√
Δ < 0, which is impossible.
Inconclusion,aquadraticjerksystemcannothavetwostableequilibria.Therefore,
the general case (30) can be modiﬁed to
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = a1x + a2y + a3z + a4y2 + a5z2 + a6xy + a7xz + a8yz + a9 ,
where there is no x2 term in the ˙z equation to ensure one and only one equilibrium
to exist.
Such a system has only one equilibrium at (−a9/a1, 0, 0), whose stability requires

(35)
Considering several thousands of combinations of the coefﬁcients a1 through a9
and the initial conditions subject to the constraints (35), an exhaustive computer
search was carried out to seek cases with the largest Lyapunov exponent greater than
0.001. For each case found, the space of coefﬁcients was searched over, while as
many coefﬁcients as possible are set to zero with the others set to ±1 if possible, or
otherwise to a small integer or decimal fraction with the lowest possible digits.
Cases SE1 −SE6 in Table 3 are six simple examples found in this way.
5.2
17 Simple Chaotic Flows
By applying similar calculations of the jerk system method, Jafari and Sprott [3]
investigated 17 simple structures of chaotic ﬂows with only one equilibrium, as listed
in Table 4, from SE7 to SE23. The Lyapunov spectra and Kaplan–Yorke dimensions
are also shown in Table 4, along with initial conditions that are close to the attractors.

Chaotic Systems with Stable Equilibria
43
It is constructive to ﬁnd most of the elementary forms of chaotic ﬂows with one
stable equilibrium, as these 17 additional cases, either equivalent to one of the cases
listed by some linear transformations of variables or they were extensions of these
cases with additional terms.
A three-dimensional view of the state-space diagram of the cases shown in Tables
3, 4 are dissipative, with attractors as shown in Fig.5. From a common point of view,
these 23 systems have the attractor dimensions only slightly above 2.0, whereas the
largest one is SE20 with DKY = 2.1753.
They were analyzed as in the previous sections. However, it should be noted that
all the equilibria calculated in [3] are spiral nodes with one pair of complex conjugate
eigenvalues, rather than simple nodes with all real eigenvalues. Therefore another
common feature of these systems is the small negative real part in the complex pair
of eigenvalues, compared to the real eigenvalue case.
In conclusion, simple chaotic systems with one and only one stable equilibrium
are common, rather than unusual, as they were once thought to be. Some more
constructive results will be illustrated in the following chapters.

Chaos with Stable Equilibria
6.1
Yang-Chen System
A chaotic system with more than one equilibrium was reported earlier than a chaotic
system with only one equilibrium.
Connecting the original Lorenz system and the original Chen system, Yang and
Chen [10] ﬁrst introduced a chaotic system with stable equilibrium points in the
following three-dimensional autonomous system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −z)
˙y = cx −xz
˙z = −bz + xy.
(36)
where a, b and c are parameters, referred to as the Yang-Chen system. This system
has one saddle and two stable node-foci, which is topologically different from all
the well-known systems such as the Lorenz system [24], Chen system [25], and Lü
system [26].
The Šil’nikov criterion is applicable to the Yang-Chen system. If one chooses a
condition with a = c = 35, b = 3, then system (36) becomes
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = 35(y −x)
˙y = 35x −xz
˙z = −3z + xy.

in which the equilibrium point E1 is a saddle and the equilibria E2,3 are two stable
node-foci.
The complex dynamics of system (37) is shown in Fig.6.
6.2
Yang-Wei System
Motivated by the Yang-Chen system, it is interesting to ask whether or not there are
similar three-dimensional autonomous chaotic systems with only stable node-foci.
Yang and Wei [11] gave a positive answer to this question. They introduced and
analyzed a chaotic system with two stable node-foci as its only equilibria, which
enhance or even modify the current theory and characterization of the structural
properties of chaotic attractors in general.
The Yang-Wei system is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = −cy −xz
˙z = −b + xy,
(40)
where a, b and c are real parameters. If and only if the conditions of a ̸= 0 and b > 0
are satisﬁed, the Yang-Wei system has two equilibria:

and
E2(−x0, −y0, z0) =

.
For a = 10, b = 100 and c = 11.2, the system (40) becomes
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = 10(y −x)
˙y = −11.2y −xz
˙z = −100 + xy,
(41)
with two equilibria
 E1(10, 10, −11.2)
E2(−10, −10, −11.2).
(42)
Three characteristic values of the Jacobian of its linearized system, evaluated at
the equilibria E1,2, are given by
λ1 = −20.9778, λ2,3 = −0.1111 ± 9.7635i ,
(43)
which indicates that E1,2 are two stable node-foci.
It is interesting to note that the system (40) contains the well-known diffusionless
Lorenz system, the Burke–Shaw system, and some others, as special cases.
Hopf bifurcation and singularly degenerate heteroclinic and homoclinic orbits
were analyzed in detail in [11].
6.3
Delayed Feedback of Yang-Wei System
In order to investigate the effect of delayed feedback on the three-dimensional chaotic
system with only two stable node-foci, found by Yang et al. [8], the system controlled
by the time-delay controlling forces is designed in [8], as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = −cy −xz + k[y(t −τ) −y]
˙z = −b + xy,
(44)
where τ is the time delay, k is the gain of the time delay feedback.
The associated characteristic equation of the linearized system is
λ + (a + c + k)λ2 + (b + ak)λ + 2ab −(λ2 + aλ)ke−λτ = 0.
(45)
When τ = 0, Eq.(45) becomes

50
X. Wang and G. Chen
λ + (a + c)λ2 + bλ + 2ab = 0.
(46)
According to the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, Eq.(46) has three roots with negative
real parts under the following condition:
b > 0, c > a .
(47)
Therefore, the two equilibria E1 and E2 are both stable nodes or node-foci.
6.4
More Examples
To design a control law, such as the Yang-Wei feedback nonlinear control system
[6], can be understood as adding a perturbation to the chaotic system such that the
feedback controlled system undergoes a controllable Hopf bifurcation. In so doing,
Wei and Yang introduced a feedback controller
u = m(x −y) + n(x −y)3 ,
(48)
to control the system, yielding
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = −cy −xz
˙z = −b + xy + u.
(49)
The associated Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium point O(0, 0, 0) is
JO =
⎡
⎣
−a
a
0
−z0
−c
−x0
y0 + m x0 −m
0
⎤
⎦.
(50)
The corresponding characteristic equation is
λ3 + (a + c)λ2 + (b −m
√
b)λ + 2ab = 0,
(51)
which indicates that the control gain u has no inﬂuence on the eigenvalues of the
matrix JO.
It is clear that the controlled system (49) does not change the divergence of the
Yang-Wei system (40) and the controller (48) still keeps the equilibrium structure of
the system (40).
Based on numerical analysis, parameter conditions can be found under which the
system (49) presents Hopf bifurcation at the equilibria, some degenerate cases, Lya-
punov coefﬁcients and the criticality of Hopf bifurcation. The unknown dynamical
behaviors of chaotic attractors with stable equilibria are also investigated.

Chaotic Systems with Stable Equilibria
51
Wei and Yang [27] also introduced a new system with six terms, having only one
nonlinear term of an exponential function, as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = −by + mxz
˙z = n −exy,
(52)
where a, b, m and n are real parameters.
When n > 1 and m ̸= 0, system (52) possesses two equilibria:
E1
	√
ln n,
√
ln n, b
m

and
E2
	
−
√
ln n, −
√
ln n, b
m

.
In particular, for parameters a = 0.8696, b = 2.1, m = 0.756144 and n = 10.5, the
equilibria E1,2 are both stable, with characteristic eigenvalues
λ1 = −1.94684, λ2,3 = −0.511378 ± 4.05168i .
(53)
Therefore, system (52) has neither homoclinic orbits nor heteroclinic orbits join-
ing E1,2, but it can generate a double-scroll chaotic attractor. Clearly, it does not
satisfy the Šil’nikov conditions.
By generalizing the Sprott C system (see Table 1), another interesting system was
constructed in [15], as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = −cy −xz
˙z = y2 −b,
(54)
where a, b, c are real parameters.
When c = 0 and a = b2 > 0, system (54) is topologically equivalent to the orig-
inal Sprott C system (see Table 1).
If and only if b > 0 and a ̸= 0, according to the form for the generalized Lorenz
systems, system (54) has two ﬁxed equilibria:
E1
√
b,
√
b, −c

,
E2

−
√
b, −
√
b, −c

.
(55)
In particular, for parameters a = 10, b = 100, c = 0.4, a chaotic attractor can be
observed, which however does not satisfy the Šil’nikov conditions either. The eigen-
values of such cases are
λ1 = −10.1357, λ2,3 = −0.1321 ± 1.0465i .

When c > 0, system (54) generates very complex and abundant dynamics in a
very wide parameters domain, with stable equilibria.

Introduction
Although a large number of chaotic systems with a certain number of equilibria
have been known, in the last decade special chaotic systems without equilibrium
received considerable attention. Dissipative systems without equilibria can also be
considered as systems with hidden attractors. Chaotic systems with hidden attrac-
tors do not satisfy the Šil’nikov criterion. Thus, they have neither homoclinic nor
heteroclinic orbits [1]. From a computational point of view, numerical localization
of the hidden attractors in such systems is interesting but challenging, due to the
fact that hidden attractors have basins of attraction not intersecting small neighbor-
hood of any equilibria, which leads to unpredictable chaotic behaviors. The perhaps
oldest such example is the Sprott A system (see Table 1), which is a special case
of the Nose–Hoover oscillator [2, 3]. By modifying the Sprott D system (see Table
1), a no-equilibrium chaotic system with six terms was proposed by Wei [4]. Then,
Wang and Chen [5] found a chaotic system without equilibria when constructing
systems with any number of equilibria, a subject to be studied in detail in a follow-
ing chapter. Inspired by these works, Jafari and Sprott [6] carried out a systematic
computer search to ﬁnd 17 additional three-dimensional chaotic systems without
equilibria. Then, Leonov and Kuznetsov [7] pointed out that these systems belong
to the category of systems with hidden attractors.

Motivated by the initial Sprott A model, another no-equilibrium system with cubic
nonlinearity was constructed by Maaita [8]. In addition, Akgul et al. [9] proposed
a three-dimensional no-equilibrium chaotic system based on a chaos-based random
number generation design. Moreover, along the same line of investigation on multi-
scroll chaotic systems [10], a multi-scroll chaotic system without equilibria was
investigated [11–13]. More recently, Pham and Zhen, and some others, found several
new chaotic systems of this kind [14–18]. The dynamics and circuit realization with
a boostable variable was studied [16].

Examples That Have Been Discovered
2.1
Sprott A System
Sprott A system (see Table 1) is the oldest example of a chaotic system without
equilibria, which is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = 1 −y2,
(1)
where x, y, z are stable variables.
It is easy to verify that this Sprott A system has no equilibria by solving ˙x = 0,
˙y = 0 and ˙z = 0. Its Kaplan–Yorke dimension is 3.0 for most initial conditions such
as (0, 5, 0) and Lyapunov exponents are (0.0139, 0, −0.0139), with
3

i=1
Li = L1 + L2 + L3 = 0.0139 + 0 −0.0139 = 0.
(2)
This implies that the system (1) is nonuniformly conservative; therefore it has no
self-excited attractors but a chaotic sea coexisting with a set of nested tori, as shown
in Fig.1.
Note that this Sprott A system is a special case of the Nose–Hoover oscillator [2],
with variables that can be boosted. This means that the DC offset of the variable x
can be changed to any level [20–22].
The following two variants are introduced by Pham [14]. When replacing the
variable x with a new term x + kx, which has no effect on the dynamics, the system
becomes
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x −kx + yz
˙z = 1 −y2,
(3)
in which kx is a control constant.

Chaotic Systems Without Equilibria
57
Fig. 1 The Sprott A system with initial condition (0, 5, 0) resulting in a chaotic set (blue), and (0,
1, 0) resulting in a conservative torus (pink) [19]
Also, a chaotic sea can be observed when a ≥0, by replacing y2 with ∥y∥a in
system (1), which becomes a variant of the above Sprott A system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x −yz
˙z = 1 −|y|a.
(4)
2.2
Wei System
Wei [4] added a constant controller to the original Sprott D system to form a new
three-dimensional system without equilibria, which is the ﬁrst known dissipative
system in this category.
The Sprott D system (see Table 1):
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −y
˙y = x + z
˙z = 3y2 + xz.
(5)
The Wei system [4]:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −y
˙y = cx + z
˙z = ay2 + xz −d.
(6)
It is easy to see that system (5) has only one non-hyperbolic equilibrium,
E(0, 0, 0), with eigenvalues λ1 = 0, λ2,3 = ±i, coexisting with a chaotic attractor.
System (6) actually performs a tiny perturbation on the system (5), so as to have no
equilibria but preserving its chaotic dynamics.
In the Wei system, a, c, d are real parameters. It is the Sprott D system (5) when
a = 3, c = 1, d = 0 and is the Falkner–Skan system [23] when a = d, c = 0.
It has been veriﬁed that the perturbation d can change the type and the number of
equilibria and that the system (6) contains no equilibria when d > 0.

Fig. 2 Chaotic phase portrait of system (6) in the three-dimensional space, when parameters
(a, c, d) = (2, 1, 0.35) and initial value (−1.6, 0.82, 1.9) [14]
With a = 2, c = 1, d = 0.35, and initial value (−1.6, 0.82, 1.9), the Wei system
becomes
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −y
˙y = x + z
˙z = 2y2 + xz −0.35 ,
(7)
with Lyapunov exponents λL1 = 0.0793, λL2 = 0, λL3 = −1.5034 and the Kaplan–
Yorke dimension DL = 2.0528. Therefore, system (7) displays a single-scroll chaotic
attractor without equilibria, as shown in Fig.2.
2.3
Wang-Chen System
When constructing a chaotic system with any number of equilibria, Wang and Chen
[5] introduced another three-dimensional autonomous system,
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = −y + 3y2 −x2 −xz + a ,
(8)
where a is a real parameter.

Chaotic Systems Without Equilibria

conditions (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
By determining the plus-minus signs of the real parameter a, system (8) can be
a no-equilibrium system when a < 0, but still can generate a chaotic attractor, as
shown in Fig.3. The Lyapunov exponents with respect to parameter a were also
calculated and analyzed.
2.4
Maaita System
By modifying the original Sprott A system (see Table 1) with a cubic nonlinearity,
Maaitaetal.[8]proposedathree-dimensionalautonomoussystemwithoutequilibria:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x3 −zy
˙z = y2 −a ,
(9)
where a is a real parameter.
When a > 0, the system has no equilibria, which was analyzed through numerical
stimulations on Lyapunov exponents, bifurcations diagrams and Poincaré maps [24,
25].
For the case of a = 5.16 with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (−0.8, 0, 1.0), sys-
tem (9) has the Poincaré map with both chaotic behavior and regular orbits, as well

Fig. 4 Trajectory in the three-dimensional space with a = 5.16 and initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(−0.8, 0, 1.0) [8]
as a detectable 3-tori periodicity. Also, the system has a positive Lyapunov exponent,
a negative one and a zero one, which conﬁrms the chaotic behavior.
For the case of a = 0.6 with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (−1.2, 0, 0), system
(9) has three Lyapunov exponents that are equal to zero, which implies that the system
has regular orbits coexisting with the chaotic ones instead of chaotic behavior.
Moreover, based on Kirchhoff’s circuit laws, the circuit realization of the system
was designed by using an Op Am with three integrators and one inverting ampliﬁer,
as well as four signal multipliers. The trajectory of the system (9), for the ﬁrst case
mentioned above, is shown in Fig.4.
2.5
Akgul System
Akgul et al. [9] implemented a new three-dimensional chaotic system without equi-
libria, described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = ay −x + zy
˙y = −bxz −cx + zy + d
˙z = e −f xy −x2 ,
(10)
where a, b, c, d, e and f are real parameters.

Chaotic Systems Without Equilibria
61
Fig. 5 Trajectory of system (11) in the three-dimensional space with initial value (x0, y0, z0) =
(0, 0, 0) [9]
With initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0), its chaotic dynamics can be eas-
ily observed. But, when (x0, y0, z0) ̸= (0, 0, 0), different parameters can generate
different chaotic behaviors.
With a = 2.8, b = 0.2, c = 1.4, d = 1, e = 10 and f = 2, the system becomes
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = 2.8y −x + zy
˙y = −0.2xz −1.4x + zy + 1
˙z = 10 −2xy −x2 ,
(11)
which exhibits chaotic dynamics as well.
Although Akgul et al. [9] aimed to design a new FPGA-based chaotic oscillator
and focused on encryption studies, the electronic circuit realization, Lyapunov expo-
nent spectrum, fractal dimension and bifurcation analysis were computed by Akgul
and Pehlivan [17].
On the other hand, four complex-valued equilibria of the chaotic system with
initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0) were found:
E1,2(2.707 ± 0.573i, 0.413 ± 0.661i, −1.584 ± 3.332i)
and
E3,4(−2.962 ± 0.739i, −0.107 ± 0.766i, −3.215 ± 3.924i).

The Jacobian matrix is given by
J =
⎡
⎣
−1
a + z
y
−bz −c
z
−bx + y
−f y −2x −f x

⎤
⎦.
(12)
For the complex-valued equilibria E1(2.707 + 0.573i, 0.413 −0.661i, −1.584 +
3.332i), the Jacobian matrix becomes
J =
⎡
⎣
−1
1.215 + 3.332i
0.413 −0.661i
−1.083 −0.666i −1.584 + 3.332i −0.128 −0.776i
−6.242 + 0.175i −5.415 −1.147i
0
⎤
⎦.
(13)
By solving the characteristic equation Δ(λI −J(E1)) = 0, the eigenvalues
are obtained: λ1 = 1.020 + 2.941i, λ2 = −1.068 −2.149i, λ3 = −2.537 + 2.540i.
The corresponding eigenvalues of E2,3,4 can also be found similarly.
The phase portraits of the chaotic system with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(0, 0, 0) is displayed in Fig.5.
2.6
Pham System
Based on the Jafari LEi model [26], Pham [14] promoted the development of chaotic
systems without equilibria.
Given the following two Jafari LE systems:
Jafari LE5 system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −1.5x + zy
˙z = −x2 + y2 −5xy.
(14)
Jafari LE6 system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + zy
˙z = 0.04y2 −xy −0.1xz.
(15)
By adding a constant parameter a (a ̸= 0) to system (14) and system (15), respec-
tively, two new modiﬁed system are obtained, as follows:
Modiﬁed Jafari LE5 system:
⎧
⎨

Both of the two systems, (16) and (17), are systems without equilibria but are
chaotic when a = 0.001 with different initial conditions, as shown in Figs.6 and 7.
In addition, Pham [14] constructed a special system with hidden attractors:

˙y = 0.4xz −a
˙z = 0.3y −0.1z −1.4y2 −bxy −c,

Computational results show that the chaotic system (18) is dissipative. By setting
˙x = ˙y = ˙z = 0 and choosing appropriate values of parameters, the equilibria of the
system can be found.
When a = c = 0, system (18) has an inﬁnite number of equilibria, E(x, 0, 0);
when a ̸= 0 and c ̸= 0, system (18) has one equilibrium point, E(−a

determine the stability of the equilibrium by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix
at the equilibrium point E, one has

Wang System
By applying a systematic approach for investigating new no-equilibrium systems
introduced by Jafari et al. [6], which is to be discussed in more detail in the next
section, Wang et al. [18] proposed a new chaotic system without equilibria:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = k1xy + k2xz + k3yz + k4y3 + k5z3 + k6,
(23)
where ki are adjusting parameters and particularly k6 ̸= 0.

initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 3, 0) [16]
By solving ˙x = ˙y = ˙z = 0, one gets k6 = 0, which is inconsistent because it has
conﬂict with the assumption of k6 ̸= 0. Thus, system (23) has no equilibria.
With parameters a = 0.49, b = 0.75 and initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 3, 0),
the phase portrait of this system is shown in Fig.10. Also, Lyapunov exponents are
L1 = 0.034, L2 = 0, L3 = −0.173. Other dynamical behaviors of this system were
analyzed in [18].

Systematic Approach for Finding Chaotic Systems
Without Equilibria
Systematic approach is a useful method for ﬁnding rare systems without equilibria
or with hidden attractors. In the book Systems with Stable Equilibrium [14], Pham
shows an interesting example of using systematic approach by considering a general
equation having quadratic nonlinearities with eight coefﬁcients (a1 −a8), as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = a1y + a2z + a3y2 + a4z2 + a5xy3 + a6xz + a7yz + a8,
(24)
where parameters a8 ̸= 0.

Chaotic Systems Without Equilibria
67
Fig.10 Phaseportraitofsystem(21)witha = 1, b = 0.8, c = 2 andinitialcondition(x0, y0, z0) =
(0, 3, 0) [18]
By solving ˙x = ˙y = ˙z = 0, one ﬁnds that a8 = 0, which is inconsistent with the
assumption of a8 ̸= 0. Thus, no equilibria exist in the system (24).
Pham’s approach suggests an effective approach to ﬁnding new chaotic systems
with hidden attractors. As mentioned in Sect.2.7, Jafari and Sprott [6] performed
a systematic search to ﬁnd the simplest three-dimensional chaotic systems without
equilibria, based on the method proposed in [3], right after the reports of the Wei
system and Wang system discussed above.
Method 1 By adding a constant parameter a to other non-hyperbolic systems,
one can ﬁnd, for example, a new system like
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + z
˙z = k1x2 + k2y2 + k3z2 + a .
(25)
With a = 0, system (25) has an equilibrium at O(0, 0, 0), whose eigenvalues are
zero and a pair of pure imaginary numbers. By adjusting and simplifying the terms
k1, k2, k3 and a, it generates chaotic systems listed as N E7 and N E11 in Tables 1 and
2, respectively.
Method 2 There are cases where the equilibria are imaginary. Jafari et al. [14]
added ten terms into a chaotic system, so as to obtain

By adjusting and simplifying the terms ki (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9) and a, one obtains

In particular, when a = 1.0 with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (1, 1, −1), system
N E3 is a simpliﬁed Wang-Chen system.
In addition, the Jafari system N E6 is one of the most elegant systems [14], where
the state variable x is conveniently controllable by replacing it with x + kx. For k1 =
k3 = k4 = k5 = k6 = k7 = 0, k2 = k8 = k9 = −1 and a = −0.75, the N E6 system
becomes

This system (28) can amend the level of amplitude by changing the value of the
control term kx, which is considered as “elegant”. Another similar discussion is
illustrated in book [14].
Method 3 By adding a constant term to each of the derivatives in a known chaotic
system, a new method for investigating chaos showing that numerically calculated
equilibria do not exist, was proposed as follows:

Multi-scroll Attractors in Chaotic Systems Without
Equilibria
4.1
Jafari System
As discussed in the above sections, a considerable number of chaotic systems without
equilibria were found and studied in the literature [4–9, 27]. Several attempts on
ﬁnding or constructing special chaotic systems, particularly systems with multi-
scroll chaotic attractors [11–13] were reported, as introduced below.
By modifying the original Sprott A system (see Table 1), Jafari et al. [11] con-
structed the following system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + ayz + by · sin(z)
˙z = 1 −y2 ,
(30)
where a, b are positive parameters.
System (30) can generate 2 × 3-grid scroll chaotic ﬂows, although it has no equi-
libria. For speciﬁc case with a = 0.1, b = 2.9, and initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(0, 1, 0), Fig.12 shows a torus coexisting with a chaotic sea. Moreover, dynami-
cal behaviors of multi-scroll attractors for parameters a = 0.1, b = 2.9 and initial
condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 5, 0) are shown in Fig.13.
4.2
Hu System
By introducing nonlinear functions into the Sprott A system (see Table 1), Hu et
al. [13] constructed two simple chaotic systems with multi-scroll hidden attractors,
based on a sine function and a sign function, respectively.
Consider a chaotic system,
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz −af (x)
˙z = 1 −y2

solving
˙x = ˙y = ˙z = 0,

simulation time t (time units = 0.1). a t = 455, b t = 500, c t = 1900, d t = 2200, e t = 3200,
f t = 3500 [13]
the equilibria of system (31) can be found. However, there is no solution for Eq.(32)
for any value of the parameter a.
Consequently, Hu et al. [13] proposed two improved Sprott A system, as follows:
Hu System I
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz −a · sin(2πbx)
˙z = 1 −y2 ,
(33)
where b is a real parameter. For a = 25, b = 1 with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(0, 0.1, 0), multi-scroll hidden attractors can be observed and the number of multi-
scroll hidden attractors depends on the transient time of the system self-oscillations,
as shown in Fig.14.
Hu System II
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz −1
2 a · sin(2πbx)[sgn(x −c) −sgn(x −d)] + x[2 −sgn(x −c) + sgn(x −d)]
˙z = 1 −y2 ,
(34)
where a, b, c and d are real parameters and sgn(x) is the sign function deﬁned by
sgn(x) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
1, x > 0
0, x = 0
−1, x < 0
(35)
Equation(34) is composed of two parts: a nonlinear part and a linear part. The
nonlinear part is the product of a sine function and a sign function, which is bounded
with dynamical range being determined by the terms c and d. While the linear part is

c = −2.5 and d = 3.5; c 9-scroll hidden attractors with c = −4.5 and d = 4.5 [13]
the product of the state variable x and the sign function, which means that one can
obtain different numbers of multi-scroll hidden attractors by appropriately choosing
the system parameters c and d. The phase trajectory with different numbers of multi-
scroll hidden attractors within a ﬁnite range of simulation time is illustrated in Fig.15.

Introduction
In the recent years, ﬁnding three-dimensional chaotic systems with an inﬁnite number
of equilibria has become an attractive topic for research as reported in the literature,
since there are some new mysterious features of such chaotic systems with important
applications in engineering [1]. The presence of such systems provides some new
insightsintherelationshipsbetweenthelocalpropertiesofalineorcurveofequilibria
and the complex dynamical behaviors of the underlying chaotic systems [2].
Despite the fact that the basin of attraction in such a chaotic system intersects
with the equilibria in some regions, an inﬁnite number of the other equilibria are
located outside the basin of attraction [3]. Therefore, the conventional methods for
identifying chaotic attractors associated with unstable equilibria do not help in such
special systems, illustrating that the “hidden” feature of the uncountable number of
attractors actually leads to some unexpected interesting phenomena.
Chaotic systems with an inﬁnite number of equilibria may be classiﬁed into three
categories, as shown in Fig.1. Different dynamical models with lines of equilib-
ria, closed-curves of equilibria and open-curves of equilibria have been discovered
recently. One of the most impressive discoveries is the ﬁrst chaotic model with a
line of equilibria, containing generalized mathematical functions, coined by Jafari
and Sprott [4]. After that, chaotic systems with parallel or perpendicular lines of

Fig. 1 Chaotic systems with an inﬁnite number of equilibria located on different lines and curves
[13]
equilibria [5, 6] and systems with hyper-dimensional chaos [7–9] were discovered.
Then, a symmetric time-reversible (STR) model was reported in [10].
Recent studies of chaotic systems with curves of equilibria, including open-curves
and closed-curves, started form Gotthans and Petrzela’s discovery [11]. There are
different shapes of curves of equilibria founded, such as parabola [3], hyperbola [12,
13], circle [14], [2], square [15], ellipse [2], rectangle [2], and some other special
shapes [16].
This chapter will provide an overview of chaos generated by systems with lines
and curves of equilibria, mostly founded in the last few years. Their dynamical
behaviors, circuit design and implementation will be brieﬂy discussed.

Constructing a Chaotic System with Inﬁnite Equilibria
Recall the original Sprott A system (see Table 1):
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = 1 −y2 ,
(1)
which is a nonuniformly conservative chaotic system without equilibria. This system
is an example of the oldest and best-known interesting Nose–Hoover oscillator [17],
which describes many phenomena in nature.
By modifying system (1), Jafari and Sprott [4] proposed a general parametric
system with quadratic nonlinearities,
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = a1x + a2yz
˙z = a3x + a4y + a5x2 + a6y2 + a7xy + a8xz + a9yz ,

Chaotic Systems with Curves of Equilibria

where ai(i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 9) are real parameters.
Equation(2) has a line of equilibria, (0, 0, z), which means an inﬁnite number
of equilibria, without any other equilibria. With the consideration of millions of
combinations of the coefﬁcients a1 to a9, and also initial conditions, system (2) is
considered “elegant” [18], since many coefﬁcients have been set to zero, while the
rests are set to ±1 or otherwise to a small integer or decimal fraction with the fewest
possible digits.
To that end, Pham [19] expanded the model and proposed a more general one
with 12 coefﬁcients (a1 −a12):
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = z
˙y = a1x + a2z + a3z2 + a4xz + a5yz
˙z = a6x + a7z + a8x2 + a9z2 + a10xy + a11xz + a12yz ,
(3)
which has a line of equilibria, E(0, y, 0).
Other two general parametric systems generating chaotic systems with an inﬁnite
number of equilibria were reported [3], in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = a1x + a2yz
˙z = a3|x| + a4|y| + a5x + a6y + a7xy + a8xz + a9yz + a10x2 + a11y2 ,
(4)
and
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a1z,
˙y = zf1(x, y, z, |x|, |y|, |z|),
˙z = f2(x, y, |x|, |y|) + zf3(x, y, z) ,
(5)
where
f1(x, y, z, |x|, |y|, |z|) =a2|x| + a3|y| + a4|z| + a5x + a6y + a7z
+ a8xy + a9xz + a10yz
+ a11x2 + a12y2 + a13z2 + a14 ,
f3(x, y, z) =a15x + a16y + a17z
+ a18xy + a19xz + a20yz
+ a21x2 + a22y2 + a23z2 + a24 ,
in which ai are real parameters.
It is noted that system (4) is also an expanded form of system (2), with a line
of equilibria, E(0, 0, z). While in system (5), modiﬁed from the Gotthans–Petrzela
system [11], f2(x, y, |x|, |y|) is a predeﬁned nonlinear function. An inﬁnite number
of equilibria are found, located on the curve f2(x, y, |x|, |y|) = 0 in the plane z = 0.

Chaotic Systems with Lines of Equilibria
3.1
LE System and a General Equation
There is a new general model in order to ﬁnd chaotic systems with a line of equilibria,
mentioned in Sect.2, system (2), where a1 −a9 are real parameters.
As shown in Table 1, cases LE1 −LE6 are six simple ones founded in the system
with six terms, and LE7 −LE9 are three other similar cases found via a similar
procedure. Based on the cases in Table 1, dozens of equivalently additional cases
have also been found.
As shown in Fig.2, where attractors of the above-mentioned cases are plotted,
these cases have dissipative properties. In addition, cases listed in Table 1 all have
dimensions slightly greater than 2.0, typical for generating strange attractors in three-
dimensional autonomous systems.
For the LE8 system, let
Fig. 2 State-space plots of the cases listed in Table 1

⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = z
˙y = x −yz
˙z = −ax2 + xy + xz ,
(6)
for which the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium point is
J =
⎡
⎣
0 0
1
0 0 −y∗
y∗0
0
⎤
⎦.
(7)
Then, one can obtain its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation λ(λ2 −
y∗) = 0: λ1 = 0, λ2,3 = ±√y∗.
Table 1 lists several analytical features of the systems, including the equilibria,
eigenvalues, Lyapunov exponent spectra, and Kaplan–Yorke dimensions, along with
initial conditions. Amongtheexamples listedinthis table, LE2 has thelargest DKY =
2.1927, for which no effort to tune the parameters was needed for generating chaos.
All the cases approach chaotic behaviors through successive period-doubling limit
cycles, while a typical example with a decreasing a and ﬁxed b = 1 shows that the
attractor is destroyed through a boundary crisis as a decreases further.
More importantly, it was observed that LE1−8 systems generate strange attractors
around a line of equilibria, while the LE9 system has a line of equilibria lying
outside the strange attractor. All these cases do not have equilibrium intersecting the
attractors, so no homoclinic orbits are expected to exist.
3.2
SL System
ChunbiaoLiandSprott[5]introducedanotherchaoticsystemwithalineofequilibria,
which is more practical because the amplitude and frequency control knob of this
system can provide a well-suitable secure key for secret communications. One can
also replace the extra ampliﬁer and attenuator in radars and other communication
systems, if such a chaotic system is used as the signal source.
This chaotic system has the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = f (x, y) + a1x2 + a2y2 + a3z2 + a4xy + a5xz + a6yz
˙y = a7x2 + a8y2 + a9z2 + a10xy + a11xz + a12yz
˙z = a13x2 + a14y2 + a15z2 + a16xy + a17xz + a18yz ,
(8)
where ai are real parameters and f (x, y) can be a single non-quadratic term.
In the following three cases, the multiplicative coefﬁcient of f (x, y) can be set
to generate chaos, thereby yielding several chaotic systems with lines of equilibria.
For the case with f (x, y) = 0, system (8) has nullclines that are planes or lines
passing through the origin with a limit cycle or a strange attractor. The simplest
example of such a case is

84
X. Wang and G. Chen
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz
˙y = xz
˙z = −xy .
(9)
Such a system has each variable depending only on the other two, which can
generate three perpendicular lines of equilibria:
(x, 0, 0) ,
(0, y, 0) ,
(0, 0, z) ,
with the corresponding eigenvalues
λ1 = 0,
λ2,3 = ±xi
f or
(x, 0, 0);
λ1 = 0 ,
λ2,3 = ±yi
f or
(0, y, 0);
λ1 = 0 ,
λ2,3 = ±z
f or
(0, 0, z).
Therefore, the chaotic dynamics of system (9) depends only on the initial condi-
tions, and are constrained to a one-dimensional manifold, which is a hyperbola on
the x-y plane.
For the case with f (x, y) = ±x, the simplest chaotic systems were found with
six terms in which one is a single linear function of x.
Among the ﬁve models illustrated in Table 2, SL4 and SL5 have lines of equi-
libria. While considering quadratic nonlinearities, the SL4 system is unstable with a
negative x, with zero being the largest real part of the eigenvalues, but the SL5 sys-
tem has a line of equilibria that is stable with a growing oscillation on the y-z-plane,
followed by a relaxation oscillation in the x-direction. The corresponding state-space
diagram of the SL4,5 system is shown in Fig.3.
For the case with f (x, y) = y, the stability is determined by the nonlinearities
and there are ﬁve non-quadratic terms. There are different numbers and types of
equilibria with a largest eigenvalue that is either zero or negative for the chosen
parameters. Among them, SL9, SL10, SL11 and SL12 have lines of equilibria. On the
other hand, all the isolated equilibria (points that are not part of a line of equilibria)
are neutrally stable. Also, SL12 generates two parallel lines of equilibria with a single
isolated equilibrium point. Moreover, systems SL9,10,11,12 are all asymmetric, though
symmetric cases exist sometimes.
3.3
AB System
In engineering applications, amplitude control of a chaotic signal is of high impor-
tance. From a computational point of view, the amplitude control parameter can be
identiﬁed from the retained isolated equilibria or the additional line of equilibria.
A general method for controlling the amplitudes of variables in a chaotic system
is introduced by Li and Sprott [6] via modifying the Sprott B system. They proposed
four models of linearization, as follows:

Four examples of the above AB systems, derived from Eqs.(10)–(13), respec-
tively, are listed in Table 3.
The preserved isolated equilibrium coordinates are reversely proportional to the
amplitude control parameters, while lines of equilibria result from the additional
absolute-value terms, which will have some inﬂuence on the dynamics, along with
the alteration of the nonlinearities in the system.
As listed in Table 3 and Fig.4, the AB2 and AB3 systems have lines of equilibria,

Fig. 4 AB system: strange attractors observed from the amplitude-controllable Sprott B systems in
Table 3, for m = 1, projected in the three-dimensional space [6]. Green color indicates the value of
the local largest LEs with positive values, while red color indicates those LEs with negative values
of all these systems are considered “safe” [6], which are either unstable or neutrally
stable in general.
By computing the non-full ranks of the new Jacobian matrices, eigenvalues of
such systems are obtained: AB2,3
(0, 0, 1) and AB5
(0, 0, 0) for line (0, 0, z) and
(√a|y|, 0, √a|y|) for line (0, y, 0), which indicates that the line of AB2,3 is stable
in one direction, while one of the lines of AB5 is neutrally stable and the other one
has unstable saddle nodes.
In addition, there are symmetric limit cycles coexisting with strange attractors
in the above AB systems, including also those systems without lines of equilibria.
Moreover, the line of equilibria threads the attractors with multi-stability for different
segments of lines, therefore the corresponding attractors are hidden.
The amplitude control is decreased by the existence of multi-stability, when initial
conditions switch the basin of attraction, thereby initiating the state-shift of the
coexisting attractors.
3.4
STR System
To investigate the chaotic systems with strange attractors in both forward and
reversed time, with the same parameters, Sprott [10] introduced a three-dimensional
autonomous chaotic system with polynomial nonlinearities, which generate strange
attractors, in the following form:

(14)
where a1 −a30 are real parameters.
System (14) is time-reversal invariant, whereas the condition (x, y, z, t) →
(x, y, z, −t) reverses the sign of ai. To obtain chaotic solutions, a simple case was
considered:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −yz
˙y = (ax + y + z2)z
˙z = x −x3.
(15)
This system has two equilibria, (−1, 0, ±
√
2), coexisting with three lines of
equilibria, (0, 0, z) and (±1, y, 0). With a = 2, eigenvalues of the equilibrium
(−1, 0, −
√
2) are obtained as (−2.090161, 0.337974 ± 2.301872i). On the other
hand, the eigenvalues of the system on the equilibrium line (0, 0, z) can be obtained
by solving the characteristic equation
λ3 −zλ2 + az2λ −3z3 = 0 .
Besides, one can get eigenvalues (0, ±√2y) for the system with a line of equilib-
ria, (±1, y, 0). Figure5 shows a dense set of symmetric invariant periodic orbits of
system (15), coexisting with non-asymmetric strange attractors. The periodic orbit,
with a Lyapunov exponent (0, 0, 0) and initial condition (−1, −2, 1), will return to
that value within an error of 1 × 10−4, thus repeatedly yielding millions of cycles.
In addition, a hidden attractor is found in such a system, which has Lyapunov
exponents (0.0892, 0, −1.2270) and the Kaplan–Yorke dimension 2.0727.
3.5
IE System
Two general parametric forms for ﬁnding chaotic systems with inﬁnitely many equi-
libria were proposed by Pham [3], as shown in Eqs.(4) and (5). It was found that
there is a line of equilibria, (0, 0, z), in system (3) and curves of equilibria in system
(4).
Eight elegant chaotic systems with an inﬁnite number of equilibria were intro-
duced, where ﬁve systems (LE1 −LE5) generate chaotic dynamics with a line of
equilibria as listed in Table 4. By applying the Wolf algorithm and with computa-
tional analysis, the equilibria, parameter values, Lyapunov exponents, Kaplan–Yorke

The I E1 system generates chaotic behaviors, where the basin of attraction of
strange attractors intersects with the line of equilibria.
3.6
CE System
Inspired by the Gotthans–Petrzela system [11], Barati [12] introduced a simple
chaotic system with two parallel lines of equilibria, in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = az
˙y = z(by2 + cxa)
˙z = y2 −1 −xyz ,
(18)
where a, b and c are real parameters.
For the case with a = 0.6, b = 0.3, c = 0.5 and initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(0, 0.7, −1.3), the equilibria of system (18) are obtained as y = ±1 and z = 0,
indicating that it is a chaotic ﬂow with two parallel lines of equilibria.
The Lyapunov exponents are (0.0345, 0, −0.8817), while the Kaplan–Yorke
dimension DKY = 2.0391. State-space plots of this C E3 system are shown in Fig.7.
3.7
Petrzela–Gotthans System
While investigating the current-mode network structures dedicated to simulation,
Petrzela and Gotthans [1] introduced ﬁve dynamical systems, each with a line of
equilibria, characterized by a more general expression. They also investigated a
chaotic ﬂow with multiple lines of equilibria.
The generalized dynamical system is given in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + y f1(x)
˙z = −x f2(x) −y f3(x) ,
(19)

Fig. 7 State-space plots of the C E3 system [12]
where the line of equilibria is given implicitly by Xe = (0 0 z)T . Based on system
(19), the ﬁrst characterized system can be generalized by setting a certain condition
for fi(x), as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
f1(x) = z
f2(x) = 1 + ay + bz
f3(x) = 0 ,
(20)
where a and b are real parameters.
For the case with a = 15, b = 1 and initial condition Xe = (0.2 0 0)T , the three-
dimensional projection is shown in Fig.8a.
The Second characterized system with a line of equilibria is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
f1(x) = z
f2(x) = ay + bz
f3(x) = 1 .
(21)
Figure8b shows the corresponding three-dimensional projection of system (21),
with a = 17, b = 1 and Xe = (0 0.4 0)T .
The third characteristic system with a single line of equilibria is obtained as
⎧

⎩
f1(x) = z
f2(x) = −x + ay + bz
f3(x) = 1 .

Similarly, the fourth characteristic system with a single line of equilibria is given
by
⎧
⎨
⎩
f1(x) = z
f2(x) = ay + bz
f3(x) = z ,
(23)
Figure8d shows the corresponding three-dimensional projection of system (23),
with a = 4, b = 0.6 and Xe = (0.2 0.7 0)T .
Lastly, the ﬁfth system has the form
⎧
⎨
⎩
f1(x) = z
f2(x) = y + bz
f3(x) = −ay .
(24)
The corresponding attractor is visualized in Fig.8e for system (24) with a =
0.04, b = 0.1 and Xe = (0.8 0.8 0)T .
As illustrated in Fig.8, there are similar geometrical structures of the Petrzela–
Gotthans systems (20)–(24). These chaotic systems with a line of equilibria are
mathematically related, because they were discovered by the same method with the
same starting model (19) having many quadratic terms. Generally, a large number
of chaotic systems proposed by Jafari and Sprott [4] satisfy this general dynamical
model introduced by Petrzela and Gotthans [1], and preserve lines of equilibria on
the x-y plane with Poincaré section z = 0.
The above ﬁve chaotic systems are all dissipative and are not time-reversible.

Chaotic Systems with Curves of Equilibria
97
In addition, circuit implementation of these systems have the same number of
active elements and network complexity.
Furthermore, Petrzela and Gotthans [1] introduced a new chaotic system with
multiple lines of equilibria, which is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = az
˙y = z(by2 + cxz)
˙z = −xyz + y2 −1 ,
(25)
where a, b and c are real parameters.
For the case with a = 0.6, b = 0.3, c = 0.5 and initial condition Xe = (1 0 0)T ,
system (25) generates a couple of parallel lines of equilibria. Only a small number of
such parallel lines is responsible for the formation of the strange attractors in system
(25), which are bounded in a certain range of volume elements.

Chaotic Systems with Closed-Curves of Equilibria
4.1
Circular Curve of Equilibria
Inspired by Jafari and Sprott’s work [4, 20], Gotthans and Petrzela [11] proposed a
three-dimensional system with circular equilibria.
The new model is in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = az
˙y = zf1(x, y, z)
˙z = x2 + y2 −r2 + zf2(x, y, z) ,
(26)
where r is the radius of the circular equilibria, a is a free parameter, and f1 and f2
are nonlinear functions with several quadratic terms, given by
 f1(x, y, z) = bx + cz2 ,
f2(x, y, z) = dx ,
in which b, c, d are constants.
For a particular case with
a = −0.1 , b = 3 , c = −2.2 , d = −0.1 , r = 1 ,
and initial condition X0 = (0 0 0)T , the Jacobian matrix is state-dependent:

⎦.
(27)
Thus, the characteristic equation is
λ3 −dxλ2 −2x(a ± b

r2 −x2)λ = 0 .
(28)
One eigenvalue is found to be zero, while the other two depend on the positions of
the equilibrium circle.
Figure9 illustrates the chaotic motion in a neighborhood of the circle, with vari-
ous conﬁgurations of the two-dimensional subspace of system (26). The Lyapunov
exponents and other properties can also be determined.
Following the above logical consideration of constructing systems with circular
equilibria, the so-called I E systems and C E systems are proposed in [11]. In partic-
ular, the I E8 system in [3] and the C E1 system in [12] also have a circle of equilibria.
The corresponding mathematical functions, Lyapunov exponents, and Kaplan–Yorke
dimensions are shown in Table 5.
Motivated by the above chaotic systems with circular equilibria (26), a new three-
dimensional autonomous chaotic system with circular equilibria was proposed in
[11]:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = z
˙y = z3 + z2 + 3xz
˙z = x2 + y2 −r2 −4yz2 ,

Figure10 shows the phase portrait on the y-z plane, with r = 0.992 and ini-
tial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (−3.14, −2.2, −6.91), where Lyapunov exponents are
(0.05996, 0, −0.2513) and the Lyapunov dimension is DL ≈2.2386 .
Recently, Pham [2] introduced a new general form based on system (26), to
investigate systems with an inﬁnite number of equilibria, which is given by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = az
˙y = zf1(x, y, z)
˙z = f3(x, y) + zf2(x, y, z) ,
(33)
where f1,2(x, y, z) and f3(x, y) are three nonlinear functions.
Note that in [2], the descriptions of the functions f1,2(x, y, z) are chosen to be
exactly the same as they are in [11], namely,
f1(x, y, z) = bx + cz2
and
f2(x, y, z) = dx .
The third nonlinear function f3(x, y) in system (33) is chosen as
f3(x, y) =
 x
m
k
+
 y
n
k
−r2 ,
where m, n and k are real parameters.
By selecting f3(x, y) = x2 + y2 −1, one can obtain the very dynamical system
introduced by Petrzela and Gotthans (26). This chaotic system also has circular
equilibria.
4.2
Square Curve of Equilibria
The new general model (33) proposed by Pham [2] can also ﬁt for the case that the
equilibria are in an approximate square shape, by setting f3(x, y) = x12 + y12 −1.
In this case, the characteristic model becomes
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = az
˙y = z (bx + cz2)
˙z = x12 + y12 −1 + z dx ,
(34)
where d = −0.2, k = 12 and m = n = 1.
As shown in Fig.11, system (34) generates chaos, and has a square-shaped curve
of equilibria, with Lyapunov exponents (0.0135, 0, −0.1387).

X. Wang and G. Chen
Fig. 11 Phase portrait of system (34), with a = −0.1, b = 3, c = −2.2, and initial condition (1,
1, 1) [2]
In addition, by linearizing system (33), Gotthans et al. [15] introduced a piecewise-
linear chaotic system, with a square-shaped curve of equilibria, given by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = z
˙y = −z(ay + by2 + xz)
˙z = x2 + y2 −1.
(35)
The corresponding Jacobian matrix is
J =
⎡
⎣

−az −bz ∗sgn(y) −ay −b|y| −x ∗sgn(z)
sgn(x)

⎤
⎦.
(36)
whereas the characteristic equation is
−λ2(az + λ) + sgn(x)[az + λ + bz ∗sgn(y)]
−sgn(y){bλ|y| + |z| + λ[ay + bzλ + x ∗sgn(x)]} = 0 .
Therefore, the eigenvalues are obtained, as
λ1 = 0 ,
λ2,3 = ±

sgn(x) −ay ∗sgn(y) −b|y| ∗sgn(y).

The state projection in the neighborhood of the square curve of unstable equilibria
is obtained, as shown in Fig.12, which also shows the square curve of equilibria
surrounded by some concentric periodic orbits.
4.3
Ellipse Curves of Equilibria
Other interesting shapes of equilibrium curves, such as ellipse and rectangle, can be
formed from the same chaotic model of Pham et al. [2].
For the case with d = −0.1, k = 2, m = 0.95, n = 0.9 in system (33), one has
f3(x, y) =
 x
m

(38)
This chaotic system has an ellipse curve of equilibria, with Lyapunov exponents
(0.0181, 0, −0.0793), as shown in Fig.13.

condition (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) [2]
4.4
Rectangle Shape
By selecting another function for f3(x, y) in system (33), a model with an approxi-
mate rectangular curve of equilibria is obtained:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = az
˙y = z(bx + cz2)
˙z =
 x

12 +

12 −1 + dxz ,
(39)
where d = −0.2, k = 12, m = 0.95, n = 0.5 and the corresponding Lyapunov expo-
nents are (0.0150, 0, −0.1314). The three-dimensional projection of the chaotic
attractor, along with a rectangular curve of equilibria, are illustrated in Fig.14.
4.5
Rounded-Square Curves of Equilibria
Motivated by the notable features of the Gotthans–Petrzela model (26) [15], Pham
and Jafari [21] introduced a new dynamical system with hidden attractors and an
inﬁnite number of rounded-square curves of equilibria. The new system has the
following form:

Fig. 14 Three-dimensional projection of the dynamical system (39), with a rectangular curve of
equilibria and initial condition (1, 0.5, 1) [2]
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = z
˙y = −zf1(x, y, z) −c
˙z = f2(x, y) ,
(40)
where c is a positive parameter and f1(x, y, z), f2(x, y) are nonlinear functions.
For c = 0, there is an inﬁnite number of equilibria, while the equilibrium curve
of the system is given by f2(x, y) = 0. Else, the system has no equilibria.
While considering the case of c = 0, different nonlinear functions can be chosen
for f1(x, y, z) and f2(x, y), such as
f1(x, y, z) = ay + by2 + xz
,
f2(x, y) = x4 + y4 −1 .
(41)
In this case, the new chaotic system has rounded-square curves of equilibria. The
system is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = z
˙y = −z(ay + by2 + xz)
˙z = x4 + y4 −1 .
(42)
where a and b are real parameters.
The equilibria of system (42) are E0(x∗, y∗, 0), and the Jacobian matrix is

(43)
The corresponding characteristic equation is
λ(λ2 + 4(x∗)3λ + 4a(y∗)4 + 4b(y∗)5
=
0 .
So, there is one zero eigenvalue but two eigenvalues that depend on the location of
E0.
Figure15 shows the projection of the system state, with rounded-square curves
of equilibria, for the case of a = 5, b = 3, c = 0. The Lyapunov exponents are
(0.0231, 0, −0.0593), while the Kaplan–Yorke dimension is DKY = 2.3895.
Additionally, in [22], based on the same system (33) and a systematic search [11,
20], another chaotic model is introduced, with rounded-square curves of equilibria,
described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −az
˙y = bxz + cz3
˙z = x4 + y4 −k −dxz ,
(44)
where a, b, c, d, k are positive parameters.
By solving ˙x = 0, ˙y = 0 and ˙z = 0, one obtains z = 0, which leads to x4 + y4 −
k = 0. This gives a curve of inﬁnitely many equilibria in the system. Moreover, the
equilibria of the system (44) are given by E0(x∗, ±
4
k −(x∗)4) (|x| ≤k

Note that the above function makes sense if and only if k > 0; otherwise, there
will be no equilibria or will be one single equilibrium point located at the origin.

Cloud Curves of equilibria
An interesting example of chaotic systems with a closed curve of equilibria is pro-
posed by Wang [16].
The special chaotic model is in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = z
˙y = −z(ay + by2 + xz)
˙z = x2 + y2 −|xy| −1 ,
(45)
where a and b are real parameters. This system is formed based on system (33), but
it has a special curve of equilibria, different from those typical shapes (circle, square,
rectangle, rounded-square or ellipse).

By solving ˙x = 0, ˙y = 0 and ˙z = 0, one obtains z = 0. Therefore, one has x2 +
y2 −|xy| −1 = 0, which means that system (45) has a cloud curve of equilibria, as
shown in Fig.17. For the case of a = 4, b = 2.5, with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(0.01, 0.02, 0.01), the Lyapunov exponents are calculated by using the Wolf method
for 10,000 iterations, yielding (0.13, 0, −0.6853). The Kaplan–Yorke dimension is
DKY = 2.1897. The projection of the system state is displayed in Fig.18.

Open Curves of Equilibria
Chaotic systems with open curves of equilibria were ﬁrst found by Pham and Jafari
[3, 23], in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −z
˙y = xz2
˙z = x −a|y| + bzy2 −z3 ,
(46)
where the real parameters a and b are positive.
The set of equilibria in system (46) is E0(a|y∗|, y∗, 0), which are located on a
piecewise linear curve. By solving the corresponding characteristic equation λ(λ2 −
b(y∗)2λ + 1) = 0, where Δ = b2b(y∗)4 −4, the eigenvalues of the system can be
determined by the sign of Δ. Generally,

From a computational point of view, this equilibrium of system (46) is unstable since
b > 0.
Chaotic behaviors generated by the system are shown in Fig.19.
For the case of a = 0.4 and b = 3, with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0.5, 0.5,
0.5), the Lyapunov exponents are (0.0756, 0, −0.3276) while the Kaplan–Yorke
dimension is DKY = 2.2308.
Four more mathematical models are introduced in Table 6. All of them have
similar properties and generate chaotic behaviors with an open curve of equilibria.
The equilibria of the I E6 system and the C E4 system have the shape of a parabolic
curve, while those of the I E7 system and the C E2 system have the shape of a
hyperbolic curve. Their Lyapunov exponents, DKY and ICs are shown in Table 6.
Chaotic motions of the models listed in Table 6 are illustrated in Fig.20.

To ﬁnd the equilibria of the system, one can solve ˙x = 0, ˙y = 0 and ˙z = 0, thus
obtaining the equilibrium point E(a sinh(y), y∗, 0). The corresponding Jacobian

For the case with a = 0.25 and initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0.4, 0.2, 0.1),
system (47) generates chaotic behaviors with only one positive Lyapunov exponent,
as shown in Fig.21a.
Another chaoticﬂowwithanopencurveof equilibriais studiedbyPhamandVolos
[13]. Based on the typical model with an inﬁnite number of equilibria, E(x∗, y∗, 0),
under the condition of z = 0, as proposed by Gotthans and Petrzela [11], the new
system is given by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −z
˙y = xz2 + a tanh(bz)
˙z = x + cy −c tanh(by) + dzy2 −z3 ,

and the discriminant is
Δ = d2(y∗)4 −4(1 −abc + ab2c −ab2 tanh2(b y∗)) .

In all the above cases, the equilibrium point of system (49) is unstable for d > 0
and y∗̸= 0. It is interesting to observe the chaotic behaviors generated by such a
system. Figure21b shows the projection of the chaotic attractor on the x-y plane for
the case of a = 0.28, b = 10, c = 0.1, d = 2.2, with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(0.1, 0.1, 0.1). The Lyapunov exponents and Kaplan–Yorke dimension are also cal-
culated, for Fig.21b, as L = (0.1042, 0, −0.2855) and DKY = 2.3650.
Two additional mathematical models, with equilibrium curves located on the
horizontal plane z = 0, are introduced by Petrzela and Gotthans [1].
The ﬁrst model is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = az
˙y = z3 −z
˙z = x2 + (z −1)y2 −z3 −1 ,

which generates typical chaotic behaviors, with a hyperbolic equilibrium curve, as
shown in Fig.22a (a = −1 and IC is (0, –0.6, 0)).
The second model is described by

Introduction
Recently, ﬁnding a new catalog of chaotic systems with surfaces of equilibria has
becomeanattractivefocaltopicofresearch.Astheadventofcomputersbecomesfaster
and faster, one can now use it to explore mathematical models in order to ﬁnd chaotic
features and the desired properties of complex dynamical systems [1]. A particular
complex category of chaotic systems are those with hidden attractors, some of which
have an inﬁnite number of equilibria on a surface lying outside the basin of attraction
that may possibly intersect the equilibrium surface in some sections. As a result, con-
ventional methods of ﬁnding chaotic attractors cannot be applied to such systems.
Notice that there was no study on three-dimensional chaotic systems with surfaces
of equilibria, an important step in ﬁnding such chaotic systems, to be introduced in
this chapter, includes a new systematic method and the ESi systems proposed by
Jafari et al. in Ref.[1]. Some hyper-dimensional chaos with surfaces or planes of
equilibria [1–3] will be discussed in some following chapters.
A new three-dimensional chaotic system with a surface of equilibria was intro-
duced in Ref.[1], including different types of surfaces, such as multiple planes [4,
5], spheres [6, 7], circular cylinders [8, 9], hyperbolic cylinders [10, 11], paraboloid
[12, 13] and saddles. Such systems satisfy at least one of the three necessary condi-
tions that any newly proposed system should have, which was established by Sprott
in Ref.[14].

Systematic Method for Finding Chaotic Systems with
Surfaces of Equilibria
To construct a three-dimensional chaotic system with a surface of equilibria, Jafari et
al. [1] applied a systematic computer method by constructing a speciﬁc mathematical
function in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = Q1(x, y, z)
˙y = Q2(x, y, z)
˙z = Q3(x, y, z) ,
(1)
where
Q1 =a1x + a2y + a3z + a4x2 + a5y2 + a6z2
+ a7xy + a8xz + a9yz + a10
Q2 =a11x + a12y + a13z + a14x2 + a15y2 + a16z2
+ a17xy + a18xz + a19yz + a20
Q3 =a21x + a22y + a23z + a24x2 + a25y2 + a26z2
+ a27xy + a28xz + a29yz + a30 ,
with ai j being real parameters.
By multiplying a function f (x, y, z) into system (1), it is possible to obtain a
surface on which all points are equilibria. Notice that such an equilibrium surface
can always be there, even with f (x, y, z) = 1 in the following model:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = f (x, y, z)Q1(x, y, z)
˙y = f (x, y, z)Q2(x, y, z)
˙z = f (x, y, z)Q3(x, y, z) .
(2)
Therefore,thecandidatesforsuchsurfacefunctions f (x, y, z)canbequitesimple,
e.g., a plane f = x, two orthogonal planes f = xy, or three orthogonal planes f =
xyz. Also, some standard quadrics may be properly chosen, such as paraboloid,
ellipsoids, and hyperboloid.

Twelve Cases: ES Systems
After a systematic search was ﬁnished, Jafari and Sprott [15] obtained twelve ES
systems with dissipative properties.
ThesetwelvecasesareshowninTable1.Noticethatallthe ESi (i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12)
systems have the largest Lyapunov exponents greater than 0.001, thus implying chaos
in the system, more precisely with chaotic attractors on the x-y plane. Also, the equi-

libria,Kaplan-YorkedimensionsandinitialconditionsaregiveninTable1,alongwith
the surface type for each ES system. For example, with a = 0.1, b = 1 and initial
condition (0, −0.08, 0), the ES10 system generates a hyperbolic cylinder of equi-
libria, with Lyapunov exponents (0.0420, 0, −0.2230) and Kaplan-Yorke dimension
DKY = 2.1883. On the other hand, the ES systems in Table 1 approach chaos through
a successive period-doubling route of limit cycles as parameter a increases. Yet, as
a further increases in the ES1 system, the strange attractor will be destroyed at a
boundary crisis.
Figure1 is a three-dimensional visualization of the state-space diagrams of the
new systems. The strange attractors in such cases are considered as hidden attractors
since an uncountable number of equilibria are found on the plane, on which a tiny
fraction intersect the basin of attraction of the chaotic attractor.
Recall the cases with lines of equilibria discussed in the last chapter, the strange
attractor there is surrounding the lines of equilibria [16–20]. However, in the present

cases with surfaces of equilibria, the scenario is quite different since the normal
component of the ﬂow is zero on the surfaces. Therefore, the equilibrium surface
will divide the three-dimensional space into two, four, or eight regions where strange
attractors cannot span.
Additionally, these systems can be useful in practice for such as secure communi-
cations. Take a sphere of equilibria as an example. No perturbation smaller than the
radius of the sphere can produce unbounded solutions, so it can ensure no entrance
and no exit of system orbits. Thus, it is a perfect protection shield of the strange
attractor inside or a protective cavity that any exterior chaotic orbit cannot penetrate.

Introduction
For a hyperbolic system, generally the Šil’nikov criterion [1–6] is applicable for
proving the existence of chaos.
In the last few decades, it has been observed that although most dynamical systems
are of hyperbolic type, there are still many others that are not so. For non-hyperbolic
chaotic systems, the saddle-focus equilibrium point is usually not involved, such as
those proposed by Sprott [7–10].
Recently, many chaotic systems, which can display three-wing, four-wing and
even multi-wing chaotic attractors, are observed. For example, the Chen system [11,
12], Lorenz system [13, 14] and other Lorenz-like systems [15–17, 17–19] all can
generate a two-wing attractor with two unstable saddle-foci and one unstable node.
There lies an unstable saddle-focus equilibrium near the center of each butterﬂy-
shaped wing. Additionally, it was found that there lies an unstable saddle-focus near
the center of each wing of a multi-wing chaotic attractor. This common feature may
indicate that the number of equilibria can determine the shape of a multi-wing chaotic
attractor. Therefore, it is interesting to ask if it is possible to construct a chaotic system

with an arbitrary number of equilibria, and whether the number of equilibria also
determines the shape of the chaotic attractor.
On the other hand, the stability of the equilibrium of an autonomous dynamical
system is of high importance in the study of chaotic theory. Recall that Yang and
Chen [20] introduced a dynamical system with one saddle and two stable node-foci,
and they [21] also introduced an unusual three-dimensional autonomous quadratic
Lorenz-like system with only two stable node-foci. Moreover, Wang and Chen [22]
found a chaotic system with only one stable node-focus. These examples motivate
another interesting question as if it is possible for a chaotic system to generate chaos
with two, or three, or even an arbitrarily large number of stable or unstable equilibria.
This chapter introduces several examples of chaotic systems, proposed by Wang
[23], with an arbitrarily preassigned number of equilibria, and another method, pro-
posed by Zhang et al. [24], for a chaotic system to have any preassigned number of
equilibria.
Recall that almost all the typical examples of chaotic attractors in three-
dimensional autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations have one or more
spiral saddle points, which satisfy the Šil’nikov condition [25]. These attractors are
“self-excited” and they can be found by choosing initial conditions on the unstable
manifold in the vicinity of one of these equilibria [26, 27].
For systems that admit a wide variety of chaotic solutions like the generalized
version of the Nose-Hoover oscillator [28, 29], described by the following equations,
it is natural to ask whether a chaotic attractor can exist if the system has only one
equilibrium:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = f (x, y, z) ,
(1)
where
f (x, y, z) = a1x + a2y + a3z + a4x2 + a5y2 + a6xy + a7xz + a8yz + a9
(2)
is determined to guarantee the system to have one single equilibrium, at (x, y, z) =
(0, 0, −a9/a3) with a3 ̸= 0 or a9 = 0.
Note that it is also possible to include the term z2 in Eq. (2) and adjust the
constant a9 so that the two roots of f (x, y, z) = 0 coincide, but this turned out to be
unnecessary for the present purpose.
The simplest chaotic system in the form of (1) has f = 1 −y2, which has been
extensively studied in the Sprott A system. Nevertheless, such a system is conser-
vative without any equilibria. However, in a weakly dissipative form of (1), with
f = 1 + ϵtanhx −y2, it has no equilibria since a3 = 0 and a9 ̸= 0, but neverthe-
less can produce a chaotic attractor. All systems in the form of (1) have a nonlinear
damping whose magnitude and sign both depend on the time average of z along the
orbit due to the presence of the y −z term.
As shown in Ref.[30, 31], systems (1) with various forms of f (x, y, z) can have
chaotic attractors for two types of the equilibria. By selecting appropriate constraints

and searching over the nine-dimensional parameter space and three-dimensional
space of initial conditions, it is possible to ﬁnd bounded and dissipative solutions with
a positive Lyapunov exponent. Consequently, by simplifying the resulting system by
removing unnecessary terms and setting some parameters to unity, it is possible to
ﬁnd some desirable chaotic systems as further discussed in more details below.

A Modiﬁed Sprott E System with One Stable Equilibrium
By modifying the Sprott E system (see Table 1), a new dynamical system with
only one equilibrium was introduced by Wang and Chen [22].
The new system has the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz + a
˙y = x2 −y
˙z = 1 −4x.
(4)
where a is a constant parameter and the equilibrium of the system is a stable node-
focus.
With a = 0, the system reduces to the original Sprott E system (see Table 1).

With a ̸= 0, the stability of the single equilibrium turns out to be fundamentally
different. In particular, for a > 0, the system has only one stable equilibrium:
E(x, y, z) =

.
Through numerical simulation, the eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian
matrix,witha = 0 anda > 0 respectively,arefoundaslistedinTable1.Interestingly,
system (4) can display a one-scroll chaotic attractor, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
Moreover, with different numbers of stable equilibria, the system can remain to
be chaotic, as further discussed in the following.
2.2
Chaotic System with Two Equilibria
To obtain a chaotic system with two equilibria, the system (4) is rewritten in terms
of u, v, w, as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙u = vw + a
˙v = u2 −v
˙w = 1 −4u.

By selecting the following coordinate transformation:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙u = x2 −z2
˙v = y
˙w = 2xz,
which is a rotation symmetry about the y axis, denoted Ry(π), the system (5) is
transformed to be in (u, v, w) with two original points (±x, ±y, ±z) corresponding
to the new variables (u, v, w). After the transformation, the new system reads

The new two-petal chaotic

The system (6) is not globally but only locally topologically equivalent to system
(4) since it has a singularity at the origin. The new system (6) has two equilibria,
which are symmetrical and independent of the parameter a, as follows:

obtained as

Hence, the eigenvalues of system (6) at the equilibrium E1( 1
2, 1
16, 0) are obtained as
λ1 = −1
< 0
λ2 = −2a + 0.5i
λ3 = −2a −0.5i .
It is clear that one can control the stability of these equilibria by adjusting the
parameter a. Figure 2 shows a symmetrical two-petal chaotic attractor of the system
(6). Especially, for a < 0 these equilibria are unstable and for a > 0 they are stable.
The largest Lyapunov exponent of system (6) is illustrated in Fig. 3. Therefore, the
existence of chaotic behavior for certain values of the parameter a is veriﬁed.

Chaotic System with Three Equilibria
To obtain a chaotic system with three equilibria, the following transformation is
applied:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙u = x3 −3xz2
˙v = y
˙w = 3x2z −z3 ,
which is rotation about the y-axis with symmetry, denoted as Ry( 2

The system has a symmetrical three-petal equilibria, which are dependent on the
parameter a. For a < 0, these equilibria are unstable, and for a > 0 they are stable.
Analysis on the equilibria and the corresponding Jacobian eigenvalues for two
particular values of parameter, a = 0.01 and a = −0.01, are shown in Table 2.
The existence of chaos in system (7) is also supported by numerical calculation.
The three-dimensional view of the new three-peral equilibria, when a = 0.01, is
shown in Fig. 4.

Constructing a Chaotic System with Any Number of
Equilibria
To continue, a dynamical system with ﬁve equilibria is obtained via the following
transformation:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙u = x5 −10x3z2 + 5xz4
˙v = y
˙w = 5x4z −10x2z3 + z5 ,
(8)
which is a rotation about the y-axis with symmetry, denoted as Ry( 2
5π). Applying this
transformation to system (5), a new chaotic system is obtained, with ﬁve symmetrical
equilibria, as shown in Fig. 5.

132
X. Wang et al.
In general, the above Wang’s method is to apply the transformation (x + iz)n =
(u + iw) to obtain a new chaotic system with n equilibria, in theory. Note that the
new systems so obtained all have global chaotic attractors and space the chaotic ﬂows
locally converge to the stable equilibrium.
Wang [23] also pointed out that the above systematic method for constructing new
chaotic systems with any number of equilibria only provides a theoretical framework,
but it had been noticed the chaotic attractor destines to ﬂatten out as the value of the
number n increases. Theoretically, there may still exist a possibly very narrow range
of parameter values of a for chaos to present.
Later, Zhang et al. [24] introduced another method for constructing dynamical
systems with an arbitrarily large number of chaotic attractors, and showed that the
resulting global dynamics are related to the equilibria and the discontinuous points.
This new method was inspired by the Wang’s method [23] and some others [32, 33],
as introduced below.
For a positive integer n, consider a complex polynomial function:
f (w) = anwn + an−1wn−1 + · · · + a0 ,
where ai ∈C, an ̸= 0, and w ∈C. By the classical theory of complex analysis, there
is a positive number N1 for any w0 ∈C with |w0| ≥N1, such that the solution of the
equation f (w) = w0 consists of n distinct complex numbers.
Thus, one can set
w := x = +iy
and let
f (w) := f1(x1, x2) + i f2(x1, x2) ,
where i = √−1, and f1 : R2 →R is the real part while f2 : R2 →R is the imag-
inary part.
Then:
1. Take an autonomous system, denoted by ˙p = (p) with p ∈R3. A chaotic attrac-
tor and the basin of attraction will be contained in the following region:
{(p1, p2, p3) : |p1| ≤M1, |p2| ≤M2}
2. Let the geometric structure of the attractor not be affected by the coordinate trans-
formation below, so that one can “move” the basin of attraction to a “safe place”.
Theoretically, one can set N := max{N1, M1, M2}. The coordinate transforma-
tion in terms of u = (u1, u2, u3) reads
⎧
⎨
⎩
p1 = u1 −2N
p2 = u2 −2N
p3 = u3 .

Chaotic Systems with Any Number and Various Types of Equilibria
133
3. For the new dynamical system ˙u = (u), apply the complex function f to gen-
erate a system with an arbitrarily large number of chaotic attractors. In so doing,
consider the coordinate transformation in terms of x = (x1, x2, x3), as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
u1 = f1(x1, x2)
u2 = f2(x1, x2)
u3 = x3 .
Following the above discussion, it can be veriﬁed that the new chaotic system
˙x = ˆ(˙x)
(9)
has n chaotic attractors.
Theoretically, one might observe chaotic attractors in similar shapes. The geomet-
ric structures of the attractors will not be affected by the above transformation. Also,
numerical experiments should be used to discover the proper system parameters and
initial conditions.
An example using this method to construct a chaotic system with any number of
equilibria is the following system, obtained from the Lorenz system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x1 = 10(x2 −x1)
˙x2 = 28x1 −x1x3 −x2
˙x3 = x1x2 −8
3x3 .
(10)
Following the new method, a function is constructed:
f (w) = wn = (x1 + ix2)n =
n

k=0
Ck
nxn−k
z
(ix2)k = f1(x1, x2) + i f (x1, x2) ,
where
Ck
n =
n!
k!(n −k)!,
0 ≤k ≤n.
Choose, for example. N1 = 0.1. Then, the region of the attractor is obtained:
{(p1, p2, p3) :
|p1| < R1 := 40, |p2| < R2 := 40, −2 < p3 < R3 := 80} .
The coordinate transformation is
⎧
⎨
⎩
p1 = u1 −2N = u1 −80
p2 = u2 −2N = u2 −80
p3 = u3 ,
where N = max{N1, R1, R2} = 40, with the basin of attraction contained in the
set

{(u1, u2, u3) : 40 < u1 < 120, 40 < u2 < 120, −2 < u3 < 80} ,
for which the corresponding system is given by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙u1 = 10(u2 −u1)
˙u2 = 28u1 −u1u3 −u2 −2160
˙u3 = (u1 −80)(u2 −80) −8
3u3 .
(11)
Considering the simplicity in numerical simulation, the value of the integer n is
set to be n = 2. Thus,
f1(x1, x2) = x2
1 −x2

, and
f2(x1, x2) = 2x1x2 ,
hence the coordinate transformation gives

3.1
System with No Equilibria
A simple example of a dissipative chaotic system, in the form of Eq. (1) without
equilibria, is given by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = x2 −4y2 + 1 .
(13)
For initial condition (0, 2, 0), it has a chaotic attractor, with Lyapunov exponents
(0.0131, 0, −0.0155) and a relatively large KaplanâŁ“Yorke dimension, 2.8455, as
shown in Fig. 7.
This chaotic attractor is “hidden”, which cannot be found by using an initial
condition in the vicinity of an equilibrium, since simply no such points exist [26,
27].
The system (13) is time-reversal invariant under the transformation (x, y, z, t) →
(x, −y, −z, −t). Its chaotic attractor is slightly asymmetric and is accompanied
by a repellor that is symmetric with it under a 180◦rotation about the x-axis and
intertwined with it. The attractor and repellor exchange their roles when time is
reversed. The asymmetry in z is the source of the weak nonlinear damping, since its
time-averaged value along the chaotic orbit is < z >≈−0.0024.
This system is unusual, because the chaotic attractor is intertwined with a set of
nested conservative tori, which are symmetric under rotation about the x-axis and
< z >= 0.

the initial conditions that
give conservative orbits
(tori), and the yellow

attraction of the chaotic
attractor [39]
Figure 7 shows one such torus with initial condition (0, 1.2, 0), for which the
Lyapunov exponents are (0, 0, 0).
Figure 8 shows a cross-section on the z = 0 plane of the nested tori, surrounded
by what looks like a chaotic sea but is actually a weakly dissipative chaotic attractor.
Sixty-three initial conditions were spaced uniformly over the range −2.9625 ≤
x ≤−0.6522 with y = z = 0. The blue background shows the initial conditions
that generate conservative orbits (tori), and the yellow background is the basin of
attraction for the chaotic attractor. It appears that there are additional thin tori toward
the outer edge of the chaotic attractor. The basin of attraction for the chaotic attractor
is the whole state space, except for the region of a ﬁnite volume occupied by the tori.
Only a few other such examples are known today [34–36].
3.2
Hyperbolic Examples
Eight types of hyperbolic equilibria in three-dimensional ﬂows are shown in Table 3
and Fig. 9. Among the eight cases with hyperbolic equilibria, Type 7 is overwhelm-
ingly the most common one in dissipative chaotic systems, while other examples
also occur in the other seven cases.
All cases are discussed below.

Types of hyperbolic equilibria in three-dimensional ﬂows [39]
3.2.1
Equilibrium Type 1 (Index-0 Node)
This type of system has a single equilibrium with three real eigenvalues, all negative.
Hence, it is a stable node with index 0, where the index is the number of eigenvalues
with a positive real part, or equivalently, the dimension of the unstable manifold.
A typical system of this type is
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = −z −8xy + 0.3xz −3 .
(14)

and a chaotic attractor with Lyapunov exponents (0.0505, 0, −17.2283). The chaotic
attractor is hidden, and all initial conditions in the vicinity of the equilibrium are
attracted to the equilibrium point. It is also multi-stable since the chaotic attractor
coexists with a point attractor. Initial conditions close to the attractor are (−2, 1, 0.7),
and the basin of attraction is very small.
3.2.2
Equilibrium Type 2 (Index-1 Saddle Node)
This type of system has three real eigenvalues, with two negative and one positive.
A typical system of this type is
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = 0.5z −y2 + 5 .
(15)
This system has an equilibrium with eigenvalues λ = (0.5, −0.101021,
−9.898980) and a symmetric pair of tightly intertwined chaotic attractors with Lya-
punov exponents (0.0141, 0, −0.3030), which coexist with three limit cycles, a sym-
metric one with Lyapunov exponents (0, −0.1239, −0.2336) and a symmetric pair
with Lyapunov exponents (0, −0.0264, −0.0264). This is possible, because System
(14), like the Lorenz system, has a rotational symmetry about the z-axis, as evidenced
by its invariance under the transformation (x, y, z) →(−x, −y, z). Hence, either the
solutions share that symmetry, or there is a symmetric pair of them. All the attrac-
tors are hidden, and all initial conditions in the vicinity of the equilibrium produce
unbounded orbits. Initial conditions that give the ﬁve attractors are (±0.9, 0, −2),
(0.43, 2, 0.18), and (±0.4, ±3, 1). The basins of attraction of the chaotic attractors
are relatively small and bounded (with a ﬁnite volume).
3.2.3
Equilibrium Type 3 (Index-2 Saddle Node)
This type of system has three real eigenvalues, with two positive and one negative.
A typical system of this type is
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = −x −0.1z −y2 + 0.3 .
(16)
It has an equilibrium with eigenvalues λ = (2.618034, 0.381966, −0.1) and a
self-excited chaotic attractor with Lyapunov exponents (0.02191, 0, −0.3181). Ini-
tial conditions close to the attractor are (0, 0.1, 0), and the basin of attraction is
relatively large.

3.2.4
Equilibrium Type 4 (Index-3 Repellor)
This type of system has three real and positive eigenvalues, and hence it is an unstable
node, referred to as a “repellor”. A system of this type [31] has the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = z + 8.894x2 −y2 −4.
(17)
It has an equilibrium with eigenvalues λ = (3.732051, 1, 0.267949) and a chaotic
attractor with Lyapunov exponents (0.1767, 0, −0.9158). The equations have a
rotational symmetry since they are invariant under the transformation (x, y, z) →
(−x, −y, z), and the system has a symmetric pair of solutions for some parameters,
but not for the ones given above. The symmetric chaotic attractor of this system is
hidden and all initial conditions chosen in the vicinity of the equilibrium lead to
unbounded solutions. Initial conditions close to the attractor are (0, 3.8, 0.7), and
the basin of attraction is very small.
3.2.5
Equilibrium Type 5 (Index-0 Spiral Node)
This type of system has one real negative eigenvalue and a complex conjugate
pair with negative real parts. Twenty-three chaotic examples of this type have been
reported in Ref.[30]. One typical system is
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = 2x −2z + y2 −0.3 .
(18)
It has an equilibrium with eigenvalues λ = (−2, −0.075 ± 0.997184i) and a
chaotic attractor with Lyapunov exponents (0.0203, 0, −2.4751). All chaotic sys-
tems of this type are multi-stable since the chaotic attractor coexists with a stable
equilibrium, and the chaotic attractor is hidden, which cannot be found by using
any initial condition in the vicinity of the equilibrium. Initial conditions close to the
chaotic attractor are (0.9, 0, 0.7), and the basin of attraction is very large.
3.2.6
Equilibrium Type 6 (Index-1 Spiral Saddle)
This type of system has one real positive eigenvalue and a complex conjugate pair
with negative real parts. A typical system of this type is
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = 0.28z −xy + 0.48 .

λ = (0.28, −0.857143 ±

(0.0677, 0, −1.5020). The equations have a rotational symmetry since they are
invariant under the transformation (x, y, z) →(−x, −y, z). The chaotic attractors
are hidden, and all initial conditions in the vicinity of the equilibrium lead to
unbounded orbits. Initial conditions close to the attractors are (0, ±4, 2), and the
basins of attraction are very small.
3.2.7
Equilibrium Type 7 (Index-2 Spiral Saddle)
This type of system has one real negative eigenvalue and a complex conjugate pair
with positive real parts. This is overwhelmingly the most common type with abun-
dant examples, including the familiar Lorenz system [13] and Rössler system [37],
although they have multiple equilibria. The simplest such system with a single equi-
librium is the jerk system [9]: ...x + 2.017¨x −˙x2 + x = 0. Other simple examples are
the Sprott I, J, L, N, and R systems [8]. There are also some systems in the form of
Eq. (1), which have not been carefully studied, including the following model:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = −z + xy + 0.39 ,
(20)
which is functionally the same as System ET 6 with rotational symmetry but having
different parameters.
This system has an equilibrium with eigenvalues λ = (−1, 0.195 ± 0.980803i)
and a symmetric pair of chaotic attractors with Lyapunov exponents (0.0820, 0,
−0.6920). The chaotic attractors are self-excited, although the equilibrium lies on
their basin boundary. Its attractor can be found, depending on where in the vicinity of
the equilibrium the initial condition is chosen. Initial conditions close to the attractors
are (±1.4, ±1, 1), and the basins of attraction are relatively large.
3.2.8
Equilibrium Type 8 (Index-3 Spiral Repellor)
This type of system has one real positive eigenvalue and a complex conjugate pair
with positive real parts. A typical system of this type is
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = 0.2z + 0.1y2 −xy −0.08 .
(21)
This system has an equilibrium with eigenvalues λ = (0.2, 0.2 ± 0.979796i)
and a chaotic attractor with Lyapunov exponents (0.1083, 0, −3.2555). The equa-
tions have a rotational symmetry since they are invariant under the transformation

Chaotic Systems with Any Number and Various Types of Equilibria
141
(x, y, z) →(−x, −y, z). For the given parameters, the chaotic attractor is symmet-
ric and self-excited. Initial conditions close to the attractor are (1, −2, 0.4), and the
basin of attraction is very large.
3.3
Non-Hyperbolic Systems
A non-hyperbolic equilibrium has one or more eigenvalues with a zero real part.
There are eleven such types in three-dimensional ﬂows. Six of these have all real
eigenvalues and are of the form (0, −, −), (+, 0, −), (+, +, 0), (0, 0, −), (+, 0, 0),
and(0, 0, 0).Fivehaveonerealandacomplexconjugatepairofeigenvalues,onlytwo
of which have nonzero real eigenvalues. The stability of the systems that do not have
an eigenvalue with a positive real part cannot be determined from the eigenvalues,
so it requires nonlinear analysis in general.
First, consider nine types of such systems, in which at least one eigenvalue is real
and zero. With λ = 0, Eq. (3) shows that a3 = 0, and thus according to Eq. (3), an
equilibrium is present only if a9 = 0. In this case, there is a line of equilibria along
the z-axis, (0, 0, z). Such cases have been studied [30], including those in the form of
Eq. (1). But, they fall outside the scope of the present book, which involves chaotic
systems with a single equilibrium. Thus, nine of the eleven possible non-hyperbolic
isolated equilibria cannot occur in system (1), although this does not imply that they
cannot exist in other systems.
The remaining two cases have a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues of the
form λ = 0 ± iω. Substituting them into Eq. (1) gives ω2 = 1 −a9 and a9 = 1 −a2
3
or a9 = 0. The remaining real eigenvalue can be negative or positive.
Examples of these two types of chaotic systems are discussed below.
3.3.1
Equilibrium Type 9
This type of system has a single equilibrium with one real negative eigenvalue and
a complex conjugate pair with zero real parts.
Chaotic systems of this type have been known, such as the Sprott E system (see
Table 1).
A system of this type, in the form of Eq. (1), is
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = −z −4xy + xz .
(22)
It has an equilibrium with eigenvalues λ = (−1, 0 ± i) and a chaotic attractor
with Lyapunov exponents (0.0394, 0, −1.4067). The equilibrium at the origin is
nonlinearly unstable, and the chaotic attractor is self-excited. Initial conditions close
to the attractor are (0, 1, 0.4), and the basin of attraction is relatively small.

3.3.2
Equilibrium Type 10
This type of system has a single equilibrium point with one real positive eigenvalue
and a complex conjugate pair with zero real parts.
A typical system of this type is
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = 0.23z + y2 −10xy .
(23)
It has an equilibrium with eigenvalues λ = (0.23, 0 ± i) and a chaotic attractor
with Lyapunov exponents (0.1241, 0, −2.4424). The system is invariant under the
transformation (x, y, z) →(−x, −y, z), and the chaotic attractor is symmetric and
self-excited. Initial conditions close to the attractor are (0, 1, 1), and the basin of
attraction is very large.

Conclusions
Autonomous systems in the form of Eq. (1) admit chaotic solutions, with one or
more chaotic attractors, in the presence of a single hyperbolic equilibrium, for each
of the eight types shown in Fig. 10. Two of these systems have a chaotic attractor
coexisting with a stable equilibrium, three of them have a symmetric pair of chaotic
attractors, and one has two chaotic attractors coexisting with three limit cycles. Five
of the eight cases have hidden attractors.
There are eleven types of non-hyperbolic equilibria that can occur in three-
dimensional systems. However, nine of the eleven types cannot occur in isolation
of a system in the form of Eq.1. The other two cases admit chaotic solutions with
a single self-excited attractor, as shown in Fig. 11. All of the nine systems have
complicated and interesting basins of attraction [38], with a rich set of bifurcations
as the parameters are varied.
Given a system in the form of Eq. (1), which can have chaos in the absence of
equilibria as in system (13), it is not surprising to see that chaos can coexist with
isolated equilibria of all types, although in most cases the equilibria are relatively
close to the attractors and, thus, would be expected to inﬂuence the system dynamics.
The results presented in this chapter support the idea that any dynamics not explic-
itly forbidden by theory may occur in an appropriately designed dynamical system.
One only needs to search carefully to ﬁnd suitable examples.
An interesting question is whether chaotic attractors can occur in systems with
the fourteen types of hyperbolic equilibria that occur in four dimensions. The answer
is YES according to Ref.[40].

Hyperchaotic Systems with Hidden
Attractors

Introduction
Recently, research focus has been shifted from classifying periodic and chaotic attrac-
tors to self-excited and hidden attractors [1–20].
Most well-known chaotic and hyperchaotic systems have one to three equilibria,
such as the classical Lorenz, Rössler, Chen, and Lü systems [21–24], whose chaotic
attractors with typical parameters are self-excited attractors. The basin of attraction
of a self-excited attractor intersects with a small neighborhood of some unstable
equilibrium. However, the basin of attraction of a hidden attractor does not intersect
with any sufﬁciently small neighborhood of arbitrary equilibrium. The precise math-
ematical deﬁnition of hidden attractors was ﬁrst deﬁned by Leonov and Kuznetsov
[1, 2].
It is obvious that the periodic and chaotic attractor of any chaotic system with only
stable equilibrium or without equilibrium are hidden attractors [6–9]. In addition to
the above two kinds of systems, in 2013 Jafari and Sprott studied a class of three-
dimensional chaotic systems with a line of equilibria [25]. In this kind of systems,
although the basin of attraction of a chaotic attractor may intersect with any small
neighborhood of a length of the line of equilibria, there will still be uncountable
equilibria falling outside the basin of attraction. Therefore, by selecting the initial
conditions in the small domain of an unstable equilibrium, the periodic and chaotic
attractors of this kind of systems may not be found easily. In other words, from the
numerical calculation point of view, any attractor of this kind of systems is a hidden
attractor.
Many complex dynamical systems [26–28], from climate and ecosystem to the
stock market and applied engineering systems, have the complex characteristic of

coexisting attractors. This kind of characteristic of a system is referred to as the
multi-stability. A system with this kind of characteristic is neither completely stable
nor completely unstable, but frequently switches back and forth between multiple
states. Recent studies have shown that the multi-stability of a system is related to
the existence of hidden attractors. A multi-stable system is extremely sensitive to the
initial states, noise and system parameters, so that the state of the system is easily
changed under sudden disturbances, switching from an ideal state to another perhaps
undesirable state.
A self-excited attractor can be found smoothly by some standard computational
procedure. However, there is no standard method to ﬁnd hidden attractors and coexist-
ing behaviors in a multi-stable system, which makes the study of coexisting behaviors
of hidden attractors more complicated and challenging.
In this chapter, we summarize some four-dimensional (4D) hyperchaotic systems
with hidden attractors, including hyperchaotic systems without equilibrium [6–8],
hyperchaotic systems with limited equilibria [9–13], hyperchaotic systems with lines
or curves of equilibria [14–16, 18], and hyperchaotic systems with planes or surfaces
of equilibria [19, 20].

Hyperchaotic Systems with No Equilibria
2.1
Example 1
In [6], a new 4D chaotic system is described:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙x = y,
˙y = −x + yz + axzw,
˙z = 1 −y2,
˙w = z + bxz + cxyz ,
(1)
where a, b, and c are real parameters.
Let ˙x = 0, ˙y = 0, ˙z = 0 and ˙w = 0, namely
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
y = 0,
−x + yz + axzw = 0,
1 −y2 = 0,
z + bxz + cxyz = 0 .
(2)
Then, if there are equilibria in the above system, they can be solved. It is not hard
to ﬁnd that the third equation of (2), y = ±1, which is inconsistent with the ﬁrst
equation of (2). Hence, system (1) has no equilibrium, thus there are no pitchfork
bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, and so on. Moreover, there is no sink for this system
as there is no equilibrium.

Hyperchaotic Systems with Hidden Attractors
151
Fig. 1 Hyperchaotic attractor without equilibrium, with a = 8, b = −2.5, and c = −30
Let parameters a = 8, b = −2.5, and c = −30, and the initial condition be
(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1). The projections of its phase portrait are shown in Fig.1, and
the Poincaré map in the y-z-w space with x = 0 is shown in Fig.2.
Under the above setting of parameters and initial conditions, the Lyapunov expo-
nents of system (1) are λ1 = 0.87, λ2 = 0.03, λ3 = 0.00, and λ4 = −1.01, which
show that the system is hyperchaotic. The Lyapunov exponents of system (1) are
calculated by the efﬁcient QR-based method, where the simulation time is 15000s
and the step length is 0.0005s.
In order to verify the realizability of system (1), an electronic circuit was designed
in [6]. To prevent the operational ampliﬁers and analog multipliers from saturating,
under the transformation x = 2xm, y = 2ym, z = 2zm and w = 2wm, the system (1)
is transformed to
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙xm = ym,
˙ym = −xm + 2ymzm + 4axmzmwm,
˙zm = 1 −2y2
m,
˙
wm = zm + 2bxmzm + 4cxm ymzm ,

which possesses the analogous properties with system (1). The designed circuit
realizing (3) is presented in Fig.3, and the phase diagrams on the ym-wm and zm-wm
planes are shown in Fig.4, which are similar to Fig.1.

By adding one more state variable, w, to the following generalized diffusionless
Lorenz equations [29]:

˙z = −b + xy,

⎪⎪⎩
˙x = a(y −x),
˙y = −xz −cy + kw,
˙z = −b + xy,
˙w = −my,
(5)
where a, b, c, k, m are real parameters, with km ̸= 0.
When the parameters of system (4) satisfy a = 10, b = 100, c = 11.2, the system
has a chaotic attractor, coexisting with two stable equilibria, (±10, ±10, −11.2).
When b ̸= 0, system (5) has no equilibria, which means that the system has no
such phenomena as pitchfork, Hopf or homoclinic bifurcations, which are common
to systems with equilibria.
Under the transformation (x, y, z, w) →(−x, −y, z, −w), the new hyperchaotic
system (5) is invariant, which means that system (5) is symmetrical about the z-axis.
It is not hard to ﬁnd that the z-axis is an orbit of this hyperchaotic system, and the
trajectory on the z-axis will tend to the origin if b > 0, as t →∞.

Let the parameters be a = 10, b = 25, c = −2.5, k = 1, m = 1, and choose the
initial condition (0.2, 0.1, 0.75, −2). Then, a two-scroll hyperchaotic attractor of
system (5) can be found, as shown in Fig.5. The corresponding Lyapunov exponents
are L1 = 0.9115, L2 = 0.0224, L3 = 0, and L4 = −8.4330, and the Kaplan–Yorke
dimension is DL = 3.1107.
Using the above parameter values and initial condition, it can be found that the
Poincaré image of the system (5) on the cross section x = y has no regular limbs,
as shown in Fig.6. This means that the new hyperchaotic system has extremely rich

This phenomenon could be due to the loss of limits from the equilibria.

Wei [9] added an extra term yz to system (6), so as to obtain a new 4D hyperchaotic
system in the following form:

σ = 35, k = −17, b = 0.8, s = 35, n = 4, v = −20, s = 35 and q = 0 (7)

⎪⎪⎩
˙x = σ(y −x) + syz + w,
˙y = −xz −ky,
˙z = −n −bz + xy,
˙w = −vx −qw ,
(7)
where σ > 0, n > 0, sbvk ̸= 0 and q ∈R. Although the algebraic form of system (7)
is similar to the Lorenz–Stenﬂo system (6), system (7) has some interesting dynamics
that were not found from other 4D autonomous systems.
Let the parameters be σ = 35, k = −17, b = 0.8, s = 35, n = 4, v = −20 and
q = 0, and choose the initial condition (0, 1, −0.5, 0). Then, the system has a two-
scroll-like hyperchaotic attractor coexisting with a stable equilibrium, as shown in
Fig.7. The corresponding Lyapunov exponents are L1 = 1.2908, L2 = 0.2086, L3 =
0 and L4 = −20.2994, and the Kaplan–Yorke dimension is DL = 3.0739.
Under the above parametric conditions, system (7) has no homoclinic (hetero-
clinic) orbits. It is obvious that the Poincaré image of the system (7) on the cross
section y = w has no regular limbs, as shown in Fig.8. This means that the new
hyperchaotic system has extremely rich dynamics, which are different from the nor-
mal hyperchaotic systems with unstable equilibria.

3.2
Hyperchaotic System with Two Equilibria
Wei [13] added two state variables, u and v, into an existing dynamo model, obtaining
a 5D autonomous system as
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
˙x = r(y −x) + u,
˙y = −(1 + m)y + xz −v,
˙z = g(1 + mx2 −(1 + m)xy),
˙u = 2(1 + m)u + xz −k1x,
˙v = −mv + k2y ,
(8)
where parameters r, m, and g are positive constants, and k1, k2 are variational control
parameters.
Under the transformation (x, y, z, u, v) →(−x, −y, z, −u, −v), system (8) is
invariant, which means that the system has a rotational symmetry around the z-axis.
Since the divergence of system (8) is 1 −r, system (8) is dissipative when r > 1.
The following theorem excludes some parameter sets that cannot make system
(8) to produce bounded chaotic or hyperchaotic solutions.
Theorem 8.1 ([13]) Consider the ﬁve-parameter family of systems (8), with two real
parameters l1, l2. If parameters (r, g) ∈(0, +∞) × (0, +∞) and m, k1, k2,l1,l2
satisfy

then system (8) has no bounded chaotic or hyperchaotic solutions.
In order to ﬁnd hidden attractors, parameters were chosen so that the system (8)
has only stable equilibria. Considering that the equilibria E1,2 of (8) are symmetric
about the z-axis, the stability of equilibrium E1(x0, y0, z0, u0, v0) is analyzed as
follows.
When parameters satisfy m = 0.04, g = 140.6, k2 = 12, and r = 7, k1 =
34, system (8) has a hidden hyperchaotic attractor, with Lyapunov exponents
(0.9616, 0.5477, 0.1425, 0.0000, −7.6518), and Kaplan–Yorke dimension DKY =
4.2159, as shown in Fig.9.
It is worth noting that system (8) has an important feature, which is the existence
of hidden hyperchaos for a range of parameters in the asymptotically stable regions
of E1,2 (see Fig.10).
To show evidence of multi-stability and to examine the robustness of the existing
hyperchaos, let 3 < r < 8 and k1 = 34. The dynamics of system (8) are shown in

ﬁrst-order system of ordinary differential equations, Correia [11] constructed a four-
dimensional system as follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙x = a(y −x) −yz + w,
˙y = −by + xz,
˙z = −cz + dx + xy,
˙w = −e(x + y) ,
(9)
where x, y, z, w are phase variables, and a, b, c, d, e > 0 are parameters. Here, the
parameters b = 9, c = 5, and d = 0.06 are ﬁxed, while a and e are simultaneously
varied.
The divergence of the system (9) is
∇V = ∂˙x
∂x + ∂˙y
∂y + ∂˙z
∂z + ∂˙w
∂w = a −b −c = a −14 ,
which means that system (9) is dissipative for a < 14. Therefore, if one chooses
adequately the parameter range 0 < a < 14, then all the bounded system trajectories
ﬁnally settle onto an attractor in the four-dimensional phase space.
The system (9) has three equilibria, where obviously the origin P0 = (0, 0, 0, 0)
is one and the other two are
P1 = ((d + β)/2, −(d + β)/2, −b, β(b/2 −a) + bd/2 −ad)
and
P2 = ((d −β)/2, −(d −β)/2, −b, −β(b/2 −a) + bd/2 −ad),
in which β =

d2 + 4bc.
Fixing b = 9, c = 5, and d = 0.06, Fig.12 shows different dynamical behaviors
in the (e, a) parameter-space of the system (9), with 0 < e < 10 and 0 < a < 5. The
largest Lyapunov exponent is shown in Fig.12a, and the second largest Lyapunov
exponent is shown in Fig.12b. With respect to the initial conditions, every orbit
starts from the same (x0, y0, z0, w0) = (5, 5, −5, −5) in the phase space. Colors are
associated with the magnitudes of the Lyapunov exponents, white for more negative,
black for zero, and red for more positive.
The complex dynamical behaviors of system (9) are investigated by means of
numerical simulations in [31]. Bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, hyper-
chaotic attractors, power spectra, and time charts are mapped out through theoretical
analysis and numerical simulations.
The chaotic and hyper-chaotic attractors exist and alter over a wide range of
parameter values according to the variety of Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation

hyperchaos to the unstable equilibria; thus, the goal of a second control is achieved,
which will be useful in potential applications.

Hyperchaotic Systems with Limited Number of Equilibria
Based on two basic four-dimensional linear systems, Zhang [12] developed a novel
approach for constructing four-dimensional piecewise-linear multi-wing hyper-
chaotic dynamic systems.
Consider the following two four-dimensional linear systems:

(11)
where a = 20, b = 5, c = 10, e = 0.6, p = 0.4, q = 1.2.
Notice that the equilibria of systems (10) and (11) are O1 = (0, 0, 0, 0) and
O2 = (0, 0, 0, 0), and the corresponding eigenvalues at O1 and O2 are same,
as γ1 = −18.2194, γ2 = 2.1701, and σ ± jω = 1.1246 ± j10.2943, respectively.
Obviously, O1 and O2 are saddle-focus equilibria with index-2.
Based on the above two systems (10) and (11), Zhang [12] furthermore found
a super-heteroclinic loop and calculated its necessary parameters using a switching
control strategy.
Assuming that the switch hyperplane is S = {(x, y, z, u)|y = 0}, and by using
switching controller F(x, y, z, u) to shift the equilibria of systems (10) and (11),
respectively, one gets

F(x, y, z, u) = ( f1(x, y, z, u), f2(x, y, z, u), f3(x, y, z, u), f4(x, y, z, u))T ,
and its expressions are determined by the conditions in forming the super-heteroclinic
loop.
Under the control of F(x, y, z, u), the equilibria of system (12) become P1(x1, y1,
z1, u1) ∈V1 and P2(x2, y2, z2, u2) ∈V2, which are located at different sides of the
hyperplane S = {(x, y, z, u)|y = 0}. The characteristic lines of 1D stable manifolds
E S(P1) and E S(P2), and the characteristic planes of 2D unstable manifolds EU(P1)
and EU(P2), are shown in Fig.13.
Note that the switch hyperplane is S = {(x, y, z, u)|y = 0}, so the function
“sgn(y)” can be introduced to system (12). Then, the following system is obtained:

System (13) is called a two-piecewise-linear hyperchaotic system, where a =
20, b = 5, c = 10, e = 0.6, p = 0.4, q = 1.2 are ﬁxed parameters, and the con-
troller is F(x, y, z, u) = (x0sgn(y), y0sgn(y), 0, 0), with x0 = 10.1023, y0 = 1.
From system (13), a double-wing hyperchaotic attractor can be obtained, as shown
in Fig.14.
Based on system (13), by shifting the transformation of two four-dimensional
linear systems, a four-dimensional multi-piecewise-linear hyperchaotic system and
a multi-wing hyperchaotic attractor can be generated. It should be noted that each
shifting linear system has unique corresponding equilibria Pmn(m, n = ±1, ±2, ·).
Based on the system (13), Zhang [12] further obtained the characteristic lines of 1D
stable manifolds E S(Pmn) and the characteristic planes of 2D unstable manifolds
EU(Pmn) of the four-dimensional multi-piecewise-linear hyperchaotic system, as
shown in Fig.15.
Based on the above theory and analysis, in order to generate a multi-wing hyper-
chaotic attractor, the controller F(x, y, z, u) in system (13) can be selected as
F(x, y, z, u) =
⎛
⎜⎜⎝

where x0 = 10.1023, y0 = 1, and M is a positive integer.

erated. For example, with x0 = 10.1023, y0 = 1 and M = 5, a 12-wing hyperchaotic
attractor is generated, as shown in Fig.16.

ters satisfy a = 0.386, b = 0.2, and initial condition (0.7, −0.6, −0.7)T , the Rössler
type-IV system (15) exhibits chaotic behaviors, with two equilibria E1(0, 0, 0) and
E2(0, 1.518, −1.581).
Recently, Singh [15] developed a new 4D chaotic system by introducing a state
feedback control to the second equation of system (15). The new 4D chaotic system
is described by
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙x1 = −x2 −x3,
˙x2 = x1 −x4,
˙x3 = a(x2 −x2
2) −bx3,
˙x4 = cx2 ,
(16)
where a, b, c are real parameters and x1, x2, x3, x4 are state variables. In [15],
parameters a = b = 0.5 are kept ﬁxed, but c is a bifurcation parameter.
The divergence of system (16) is described by
∇V = ∂˙x
∂x + ∂˙y
∂y + ∂˙z
∂z + ∂˙w
∂w = −b .
Thus, system (16) is dissipative for b > 0.
Considering parameter b = 0.5, the system (16) has a rate of state-space con-
traction being −1/2. The boundedness of the chaotic trajectories of system (16) is
guaranteed by in the following theorem.
Theorem 8.2 ([15]) Suppose that parameters a, b and c of system (16) are positive.
Then, the orbits of system (16), including chaotic orbits, are conﬁned in a bounded
region.
Under any coordinates, with any plane and space transformations, system (16)
is not invariant, thus this system is asymmetrical about its coordinates, planes and
spaces.
Let the state equation of (16) be zero. Then, it is not hard to ﬁnd that E =
(x∗
1, 0, 0, x∗
1) is an equilibrium of system (16) for any x∗
1, namely, system (16) has a
line of equilibria.

It is noted that this Jacobian matrix is irrelevant to the constant x∗
1. The characteristic
equation of (17) is
λ(λ3 + k1λ2 + k2λ + k3) = 0,
where k1 = b, k2 = c, k3 = bc. It is obvious that there is a zero eigenvalue for all
equilibria of system (16). When parameters a = b = 0.5, c = 0.014, the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenvectors of the system can be obtained, as shown in
Fig.17.
A comparison between system (16) and (15) is given in Fig.18.
The self-excited chaotic or hyperchaotic system with countable equilibria can be
found numerically based on the knowledge of the location of the equilibria. However,
using the above method, it is difﬁcult to locate the attractors of the system that has a
line of equilibria.
Let the parameter c be varied, while keeping other parameters ﬁxed. The bifur-
cation diagrams of system (16) are shown in Figs.19 and 20, respectively, for
c ∈[0.0, 0.0629] and c ∈[0.063, 0.26]. The corresponding Lyapunov spectra are as
shown in Figs.21 and 22, respectively, for c ∈[0.0, 0.0629] and c ∈[0.063, 0.26].
According to the Lyapunov spectra, shown in Figs.21 and 22, it is obvious that
system (16) has chaotic, chaotic 2-torus and quasi-periodic (including 2-torus and
3-torus) behaviors.

In [15], the 0 −1 test method is used to classify chaotic or periodic behaviors of
system (16). The chaotic and periodic behaviors of system (16) are deﬁned based on
the values of the asymptotic growth rate (kc) of the mean square displacement of the
trajectories.
The translation variables are deﬁned as
 pc(n) = Σn
j=1x( j)cos( jc),
qc(n) = Σn
j=1x( j)sin( jc),
where c ∈(0, 2π) is a variable constant, which is selected randomly, and x( j) is the
time series of any state variable. If the space of translation variables has a random
Brownian-like motion, then it means that the selected trajectory belongs to a chaotic

trajectory belongs to a regular attractor.

Mc(n) can be deﬁned as

Clearly, Mc(n) grows exponentially for chaotic motions, whereas it varies periodi-
cally for regular and periodic behaviors.
Furthermore, based on the mean square displacement Mc(n), the asymptotic
growth rate (kc) can be deﬁned as

It was found that kc = 0.99691 ≈1 for a = b = 0.5, c = 0.014, which conﬁrms the
chaotic nature of the new system.

Example 2
By adding a controller to the classical Lorenz system, Chen [16] obtains a new
4-D Lorenz-type hyperchaotic system with a curve of equilibria. This new 4-D
autonomous system can display periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic and hyperchaotic
dynamic behaviors, and the singular degenerate heteroclinic cycles.

Let parameters be a = 10, b = 2 and c = 28, and choose initial condition
(1, 0, 0, 0), system (18) can display hyperchaotic dynamic behavior, as shown in
Figs.24 and 25. The Lyapunov exponents of its corresponding hyperchaotic attrac-
tor are
λLE1 = 0.5697,
λLE2 = 0.0453,
λLE3 = 0.0005,
λLE4 = −12.6078.
Thus, the Lyapunov dimension of this hyperchaotic attractor is DL = 3.0488.
The divergence of this 4D system (18) is

thus system (18) is dissipative when a + b > 0.
Under the transformation (x, y, z, w) →(−x, −y, z, −w), system (18) is invari-
ant. Thus, system (18) is symmetrical about the z-axis, and the z-axis is an orbit of
the system.
It is worth noting that system (18) has a curve of equilibria:

then the equilibrium E has a three-dimensional stable manifold. Otherwise, equilib-
rium E has other eigenvalues with zero real part, or has an unstable manifold.
According to the characteristic equation, when ﬁxing parameters as a = 14, b = 2
and c = 28, expect the inherent one zero eigenvalue, the features of other eigenvalues
of equilibrium E are as follows:

chosen at x = 5.
It should be noted that, under the parameter condition b = 2, c = 28 and ini-

Example 1
Memristor has natural nonlinearity and plasticity properties, which marks it have
great potentials in building various novel chaotic oscillatory circuits.
In [19], a novel two-memristor-based Chua’s circuit was designed, as shown in
Fig.29a. This circuit is synthesized by an active band-pass ﬁlter (BPF)-based Chua’s
circuit through replacing an active nonlinear resistor and a linear resistor with two
different memristors, W4 and W5. The equivalent realization circuits of W4 and W5
are shown in Fig.29b, c, respectively.
Applying Kirchhoff’s circuit laws, the dynamic behavior of the novel two-
memristor-based Chua’s circuit, as shown in Fig.29, can be described by the fol-

where a, b, c, d, e, g1, g2, k are eight system parameters in a dimensionless form.

0.15, e = 3, k = 0.05, g1 = g2 = 0.1, with initial condition (10.9, 0, 0, 0, 0), sys-

It is obvious that system (21) has a plane of equilibria, represented by

According to the characteristic equation (23), it is obvious that the Jacobian matrix
(22) has two inherent zero eigenvalues. Based on the Routh–Hurwitz principle, the
sign of other three eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix (22) can be studied. If
m1 > 0, m3 > 0, m1m2 −m3 > 0 ,
(24)
then the equilibrium P is stable; whereas if any one of the conditions (24) is not
satisﬁed, then the equilibrium P is unstable, which means that the trajectory starts
from nearby P will tend to a periodic or chaotic attractor of system (21).
According to the condition (24), let parameters a = 20, b = 150/7, c = 15, d =
0.15, e = 3, k = 0.05, and g1 = g2 = 0.1 be ﬁxed, with μ ∈[−2.4, 2.4] and η ∈
[−2.4, 2.4]. The distribution diagram of different stability regions corresponding to
the three nonzero eigenvalues in the μ-η parameter plane is shown in Fig.31. It is
not hard to notice that regions I, II and IV are unstable, while region III is stable.

Based on systems (26)–(28), eight different cases (named as QS1 to QS8) were
developed to display the quadric surfaces of equilibria with hyperchaotic and chaotic
behaviors, as shown in Fig.32, including the types of dynamics, shapes of the surfaces
of equilibria, Lyapunov exponents, Kaplan–Yorke dimension, initial conditions for
simulation, etc.
The shapes of surfaces of equilibria of these eight cases are shown in Fig.33. The
ﬁrst six of them have ellipsoid, spheroid, or hyperboloid type of equilibria, and the
rest two have cylinder type of equilibria. Cases QS1, QS2, QS3, QS4 and QS6
belong to system (26), Case QS5 belongs to system (27), and Cases QS7 and QS8
belong to system (28). Cases QS1, QS4 and QS7z display hyperchaotic behaviors
and the rest ﬁve cases have chaotic behaviors.
The stability of the equilibria of cases QS1, QS5 and QS7 are analyzed in [20],
while the other ﬁve cases can be discussed in a similar manner.
Only the complex dynamic behaviors of case QS1, which is a hyperchaotic case,
is presented in detail to avoid repetitions of similar ﬁgures. Bifurcation diagram
and Lyapunov exponent spectrum of the case QS1 are shown in Fig.34, where the

Coexistence of Chaotic Attractors with No Equilibria
All the hyperchaotic attractors reported in [6–8] are hidden attractor, since there are
no equilibria in these systems, as shown in Figs.1 and 5.

Since the ﬁne coefﬁcients of the seven terms can be normalized to be ±1 through
a linear re-scaling of the four variables and time, without loss of generality, system
(29) has only two independent parameters, namely a and b, which characterize the
system dynamics completely.
In some regions of the parameter space, it was found that system (29) has three
coexisting limit cycles and Arnold tongues (Fig.35), while in other regions of the
parameter space, system (29) has an attracting torus coexisting with either a sym-
metric pair of chaotic attractors or a symmetric pair of limit cycles (Fig.36), whose
basin boundaries have an intricate fractal structure (Fig.37).

Fixing parameters a = 10, b = 25, k = 1, m = 1, c = −4.66 and choosing
different initial conditions, the trajectories of the system (5) may tend to different
attractors in the long run:
(I) For initial condition (0.2, 0.1, 0.75, −2), the Lyapunov exponents of the sys-
tem are L1 = 1.1819, L2 = 0.0131, L3 = −0.0007, and L4 = −6.5343, and the
corresponding Kaplan–Yorke dimension is 3.1828, which means that the trajectories
tend to a hyperchaotic attractor.

initial
values:
a
(x(0), y(0), z(0), u(0)) = (0.2, 0.1, 0.75, −2)
and
b
(x(0), y(0), z(0), w(0)) = (0.2, 0.8, 0.75, −2)
(II) For initial condition (0.2, 0.8, 0.75, −2), the Lyapunov exponents of the sys-
tem are L1 = 1.1955, L2 = 0, L3 = −0.0084 and L4 = −6.5275, thus the trajecto-
ries will tend to a chaotic attractor. These numerical results imply that the trajectories
of system (5), with different initial conditions, may converge to different types of
attractors, such as hyperchaotic and chaotic attractors, as shown in Fig.38.
When parameters a = 10, b = 25, k = 1, m = 1, c = 2, choosing different
initial conditions, another type of coexistence of attractors of system (5) can be
discovered:
(a) For initial values (0.2, 0.8, 0.75, −2), the Lyapunov exponents of system (5)
are L1 = 0.0845, L2 = 0.0151, L3 = 0 and L4 = −12.0976,andthecorresponding
Kaplan–Yorke dimension is 3.0082. The trajectories will tend to a hyperchaotic
attractor.
(b) For initial values (0.2, 0.82, 0.75, −2), the Lyapunov exponents are L1 =
0, L2 = −0.1148, L3 = −0.1162 and L4 = −11.7711. With these initial values,
the trajectories of the system (5) will converge to a stable period orbit. The Poincaré
map with this group of parameter values are as shown in Fig.39.

Coexistence of Attractors with a Limited Number of
Equilibria
6.2.1
Example 1
Wei [9] studied some extraordinary dynamical behaviors of the non-Šil’nikov system
(7). Although the algebraical form of system (7) is similar to that of the Lorenz–
Stenﬂo system, they are actually different. A typical difference is that system (7)
has only one stable equilibrium under certain parameter conditions. The extraordi-
nary dynamical behaviors of system (7) includes the coexistence of attracting sets
under some parameter conditions with different initial values, including hyperchaotic
attractor and stable equilibrium, hyperchaotic attractor and periodic attractor.
Case I. Coexistence of attracting sets, under parameter conditions σ = 35, k =
−17, b = 0.8, s = 35, n = 4, v = −20 and q = 0.
(1) For initial value (0, 1, −0.5, 0), the Lyapunov exponents of system (7) are
L1 = 1.2908, L2 = 0.2086, L3 = 0, L4 = −20.2994. The trajectories tend to a
hyperchaotic attractor.
(2) For initial values (0, 1, −1, 0), the corresponding Lyapunov exponents are
L1 = −0.7997, L2 = −2.2035, L3 = −2.2479, L4 = −13.5489, which means
that the trajectories converge to a stable equilibrium. Thus, under these parame-

187
ter conditions, there is a hidden hyperchaotic attractor, coexisting with only one
equilibrium, as shown in Fig.7.
Case II. Coexistence of attracting sets, under parameter conditions σ = 35, k =
−17, b = 0.8, s = 32, n = 4, v = −20 and q = 0.
(1) For initial values (1, 1, 5, 0), the Lyapunov exponents of system (7) are
L1 = 1.3115, L2 = 0.1402, L3 = 0, L4 = −20.2517. The trajectories tend to a
hyperchaotic attractor, which is generated by an unstable equilibrium.
(2) For initial values (0.1, 0, −6, 0), the Lyapunov exponents are L1 = 0, L2 =
−0.3562, L3 = −0.4003, L4 = −18.0435, corresponding to a periodic attractor.
Thus, under these parameter conditions, there is a hidden hyperchaotic attractor,
coexisting with a stable periodic attractor.
6.2.2
Example 2
Wei [13] also investigated the 5D system (8), which has hidden hyperchaotic attrac-
tors, with certain parameters, system (8) has only two stable equilibria. Because the
missing of unstable equilibria in system (8), in some parameter regions this system
has multi-stability.
An extraordinary feature of system (8) is the coexistence of a hyperchaotic
attractor with two stable equilibria E1,2 in a certain range of parameter values, as
shown in Fig.10. For example, for parameters m = 0.04, g = 140.6, k2 = 12, and
r = 7, k1 = 34, system (8) has a hyperchaotic attractor along with two stable equi-
libria, as shown in Fig.9. The Lyapunov exponents of this hyperchaotic system are
(0.9616, 0.5477, 0.1425, 0.0000, −7.6518), and the corresponding Kaplan–Yorke
dimension is DKY = 4.2159.
To show evidence of multi-stability and to examine the robustness of the hyper-
chaos, let 3 < r < 8 and k1 = 34. Then, the dynamics of system (8) were as
shown in Fig.11, with three different initial conditions, where the equilibria E1,2
are always stable. In the left panel, the initial conditions are kept constant at
(0.05, −0.5, 0.1, −1.2), while in the middle panel, r is increased without re-
initializing, and in the right panel, it is decreased without re-initializing. Figure11
clearly shows the periodic windows, quasiperiodic regions, chaotic and hyperchaotic
regions, multi-stability and also hysteresis.
In the region of parameter space where all the equilibria of system (8) are sta-
ble, there are other kinds of multi-stability. With r = 3.5 and k1 = 34, there are
two periodic orbits coexisting in the space, with initial values (2, 1, 2, 0, 0) and
(0, 2, 6, 11, 21), respectively, as shown in Fig.40. With r = 2.9 and k1 = 29.12,
there is a periodic orbit coexisting with a chaotic attractor, as shown in Fig.41.
With r = 3.75 and k1 = 32, there is a periodic orbit coexisting with a quasiperiodic
attracting torus, as shown in Fig.42. Additional evidence shows that this is a torus
rather than a high-periodic limit cycle or a thin chaotic attractor as can be seen from
Fig.43. The ﬁgure shows that the cross-section of the attractor for y = 0 consists of
ﬁve closed loops. In addition, the Kaplan–Yorke dimension in this region is precisely
2.0.

Coexistence of Attractors with Lines or Curves of
Equilibria
6.3.1
Example 1
The seemingly simple 4D dissipative autonomous chaotic system (16) reported by
Singh[15]hasalineofequilibria,withmanyextraordinaryproperties,suchaschaotic
2-torus, quasiperiodic motions and multi-stability behaviors.
Inorder toobservethephenomenaof multi-stabilityof system(16), thebifurcation
diagram under the variation of parameter c is plotted in Fig.44. In the evolutionary
process, the ﬁnal state of the system for each value of parameter c is used as the initial
value for the next value of c. By comparing Figs.20 and 44, one can observe that the
dynamic behavior of system (16) has changed for different initial values within the
bifurcation parameter range c ∈[0.12, 0.14]. For example, when c = 0.12, Fig.44
shows that system (16) has chaotic behavior, whereas Fig.20 shows that the system
has periodic behavior. It is also can be observed from Fig.20 that system (16) has,
in addition to a reverse period-doubling route to chaos, a cascaded reverse period-
doubling route to chaos within the bifurcation parameter range c ∈[0.11, 0.125], but
there is no cascaded reverse periodic period-doubling route to chaos observable from
Fig.44 within the same parameter range. Furthermore, there are four jump routes to

according to different initial values.
The coexistence of (i) quasi-periodic (2-torus) orbit with chaotic attractor and (ii)
two different periodic orbits of system (16) are shown in Fig.45 for c = 0.123. The
coexistence of (i) quasi-periodic (2-torus) with chaotic attractor and (ii) two different
periodic orbits of system (16) are shown in Fig.46 for c = 0.119.
6.3.2
Example 2
Based on the classical Lorenz system, a new 4D Lorenz-type of hyperchaotic system
with a curve of equilibria was reported by Chen [16]. This new 4D hyperchaotic
system possesses various multi-stabilities, such as the coexistence of (i) chaotic
attractor and quasi-periodic attractor, (ii) chaotic attractor and singular degenerate
heteroclinic cycle, (iii) periodic attractor and singular degenerate heteroclinic cycle,
and (iv) different periodic attractors.
Considering the symmetry of system (18), for any orbit Γ of the system, there is
an orbit Γ
′ symmetrical with Γ about the z-axis. In the following, only one of them
is discussed.

a Periodic attractor Γ1, b periodic attractor Γ2, c Γ1 and Γ2
Let the parameters be a = 5, b = 2 and c = 28, and choose the initial value as
(−16.06, 12.978, 14.118, −8.899). Then, the trajectory of system (18) will con-
verge to a periodic attractor Γ1, with Lyapunov exponents λLE1 = 0.0003, λLE2,3 =
−0.1809, λLE4 = −6.6367. If the initial value is changed to (−16.281, 16.808,
−5.562, −7.779), then the trajectory of system (18) will converge to another periodic
attractor Γ2, with Lyapunov exponents λLE1 = 0.0003, λLE2,3 = −0.3383, λLE4 =
−6.3219. Therefore, with parameters a = 5, b = 2 and c = 28, there are two differ-
ent periodic attractors in system (18), coexisting in the same phase space, as shown
in Fig.47.
Now, let the parameters be a = 6.55, b = 2 and c = 28, and choose the ini-
tial value as (−23.997, −10.146, −1.650, −29.836). Then, the trajectory of sys-
tem (18) will converge to a chaotic attractor Ω1, with Lyapunov exponents λLE1 =
0.0742, λLE2 = −0.0004, λLE3 = −0.0556, λLE4 = −8.5610. If the initial value
is changed to (−5.400, 21.928, 2.985, −21.027), then the trajectory of system
(18) will converge to a quasi-periodic attractor Ω2, with Lyapunov exponents
λLE1,2 = −0.0002, λLE3 = −0.0179, λLE4 = −8.5188. Therefore, with parameters
a = 6.55, b = 2 and c = 28, there are chaotic and quasi-periodic attractors in system
(18), coexisting in the same phase space, as shown in Figs.48 and 49.

Next, let the parameters be a = 14, b = 2 and c = 28, and choose the initial
value as (0.00001, 0, 0, 0). Then, the trajectory of system (18) will converge to a
singular degenerate heteroclinic cycle Ω3. If the initial value is changed to (−7.346,
−16.911, 4.728, 6.853), then the trajectory of system (18) will converge to a periodic
attractor Γ3, with Lyapunov exponents λLE1 = 0.0004, λLE2 = −0.0863, λLE3 =
−0.3081, λLE4 = −15.6040. Therefore, with parameters a = 14, b = 2 and c = 28,
there are a periodic attractor and a singular degenerate heteroclinic cycle in system
(18), coexisting in the same phase space, as shown in Fig.50.
Furthermore, let the parameters be a = 15, b = 2 and c = 28, and choose the
initial value as (0.00001, 0, 0, 0). Then, the trajectory of system (18) will converge to
a singular degenerate heteroclinic cycle Ω4. If the initial value is changed to (27.982,
15.548, 29.480, 21.994), then the trajectory of system (18) will converge to a chaotic
attractor Ω5, with Lyapunov exponents λLE1 = 0.8482, λLE2 = 0.0000, λLE3 =
−0.8424, λLE4 = −16.9971. Therefore, with parameters a = 15, b = 2 and c = 28,
there are a chaotic attractor and a singular degenerate heteroclinic cycle in system
(18), coexisting in the same phase space, as shown in Fig.51.

Coexistence of Attractors with a Plane of Equilibria
The 5D two-memristor-based Chua’s hyperchaotic circuit (21), which has a plane of
equilibria with complex multi-stability, was reported in [19]. Bifurcation diagrams
and Lyapunov exponent spectra are used to measure the multi-stability of system
(21). Let the parameters be a = 20, b = 150/7, c = 15, d = 0.15, e = 3, k =
0.05, g1 = g2 = 0.1, the initial values be y(0) = 0, z(0) = 0, and x(0) = ±10−9,
and the two-memristor initial conditions be w(0) = μ and u(0) = η, which are
adjustable.
Firstly, choose initial values x(0) = ±10−9, w(0) = μ, and u(0) = η = 0. When
μ is monotone increasing in the range [−2.3, 2.3], the bifurcation diagrams of the
system with x(0) = ±10−9 and the ﬁrst four Lyapunov exponents for the system
with x(0) = 10−9 are as shown in Fig.52.
As can be seen from Fig.52, as the value of μ is varied, system (21) dis-
plays equilibrium, periodic, chaotic, and hyperchaotic behaviors, along with period-
doubling bifurcation routes to chaos and boundary crisis, and so on. In particular,

for −1.11 ≤μ ≤−0.21 and 0.21 ≤μ ≤1.11, the dynamical behaviors of system
(21) are extremely sensitive to the initial value x(0).
Secondly, let the initial values be ﬁxed as x(0) = ±10−9, w(0) = 0, whereas
u(0) = η be variable. When η is monotone increasing in the range [−2.3, 2.3], the
bifurcation diagrams of the system with x(0) = ±10−9 and the ﬁrst four Lyapunov
exponents of the system with x(0) = 10−9 are shown in Fig.53. As can be seen
from Fig.53, as the value of η is varied, the forward and reversed period-doubling
bifurcation routes to chaos and the extreme sensitivity to the disturbance coming from
the tiny initial conditions of x(0) appear clearly, which further verify the coexistence
of inﬁnitely many attractors in the two-memristor-based Chua’s hyperchaotic circuit.

Introduction
The notion of fractional-order calculus is as old as the classical calculus, which
formed a branch in mathematics lately, since the time of Leibniz in the 17th cen-
tury [1–3]. An outline of the simple history of fractional calculus was offered by
Machado et al. [4]. Factional calculus plays an important role in physics [5], elec-
trical and electronic engineering, especially circuit theory [6], control systems [7],
signal processing [8], and even chemical mixing [1].
Today, a number of techniques are available for calculating or approximating the
fractional-order derivatives and integrals [7, 9]. In the study of chaotic systems and
complex dynamics, two most commonly-used fractional derivative formulas are the
Riemann-Liouville derivative and the Caputo derivative.
The Riemann-Liouville derivative of order α, with the lower limit 0, is deﬁned by
∂α

(t −τ)m−α−1 f (τ)dτ ,
where m −1 ≤α < m ∈Z+ and Γ is the gamma function.

In the last two decades, many chaotic systems were modiﬁed to be in the setting
of fractional calculus. By varying the so-called system “effective order”, it has been
demonstrated that the chaotic or hyperchaotic systems of effective order less than
three or four can indeed display chaos or hyperchaos, as well as other complex
dynamical behaviors. There is a trend of growing interest in the study of chaos and
hyperchaos in fractional-order dynamical systems.
In this chapter, both three-dimensional and four-dimensional fractional-order
chaotic models are introduced, including the fractional-order systems modiﬁed from
the classical integral-order systems, and some new systems with inﬁnite equilibria
or without equilibria, or with stable equilibria. It is noted that these systems have
neither homoclinic nor heteroclinic orbits, and thus the Šil’nikov criteria [10] are not
applicable to show the existence of chaos in such systems.
First, several fractional-order systems will be introduced, which come directly
from the integral-order counterparts. To date, this category of fractional-order sys-
tems includes the fractional version of Chua’s circuit, the fractional-order Lorenz sys-
tem, the fractional-order Chen system, the fractional-order Lü system, the fractional-
order chaotic Rössler system and its hyperchaotic version, the fractional-order sys-
tems with multi-scroll attractors, and so forth [11–15]. A collection of such systems
were provided by Petráš and Bednárová [16].
On the other hand, by applying the predictor-corrector numerical algorithm [17,
18], fraction-order dynamical systems with an inﬁnite number of equilibria or without
any equilibria can be discussed. Moreover, by utilizing some control schemes for
stabilization [19, 20], fractional-order systems with stable equilibria can be analyzed
and discussed.
Numerical simulations and synchronization results of various fractional-order
systems will be presented in this Chapter, for their potential applications in secure
communications and control processing. For example, Li and Deng [21] investigated
the synchronization of the chaotic fractional-order Chua circuit by applying the
method of Ref.[22]. Other systems such as ﬁnancial systems [23], cellular neural
networks [24], and the van der Pol oscillator [25], etc., will not be considered in this
chapter for brevity of presentation.

Hartley et al. [26] presented a fractional-order form of Chua’s circuit. The
fractional-order Chua-Hartley system replaces the piecewise-linear resistor in the
classical Chua’s circuit [28, 29] by an appropriate cubic nonlinearity that can pro-

Within some speciﬁc values of q, for example, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, system (3) can have
chaotic dynamics in systems of effective order less than 3, veriﬁed by Lyapunov
exponents. In Ref. [30], a useful method is provided for studying such state-space
conﬁgurations. Phase projections for such a state-space system are illustrated in
Fig.1.
Table 1 shows the simulations of an appropriate qth (q < 1) integrals. For the
cases of q > 1, the approximation equation for

In addition, Table2 shows the largest Lyapunov exponents and their corresponding
system effective order q = 0.9, 1.0, 1.1. Notice that the second largest Lyapunov
exponent for each case is almost zero and the positive one indicates that the system
can generate chaos. In Ref.[26], numerical simulations are given to show that the
lower limit of the vector fractional derivative q for such systems to have chaos is

that there is no upper bound for the effective order of the system.

Fractional-Order Lorenz System
Recall the classical Lorenz system described by Ref.[31]
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −σ(y −x)
˙y = x(r −z) −y
˙z = xy −bz ,
(4)
where parameters σ, r, b > 0. Physically, σ is the Prandtl number and r is the
Rayleigh number.
Grigorenko [32] proposed a generalized form of the fractional-order Lorenz sys-
tem, using the Caputo derivative, as follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨

dαx
dtα

dβ y

(5)
For 0 < α, β, γ ≤1, and r ≥1, deﬁne the effective order or effective dimension
of system (5) by Σ = α + β + γ .
Set σ = 10, ρ = 28, b = 8
3, so that in the case of α = β = γ = r = 1, system
(5) becomes the original Lorenz system (4).
By integrating the system for different values of the parameters α, β, γ, r, and
initial conditions, some interesting phenomena and properties of the system can be
found.
The ﬁrst ﬁnding is that such a fractional-order Lorenz system can generate chaos
with the effective order Σ lower than 3. By setting the initial condition at t = 0 as
(x0, y0, z0) = (10, 0, 10) and using the parameters α = β = γ = 0.99, r = 1, the
effective order of the system will be Σ = 2.97 < 3.
The phase portrait, in this case, is shown in Fig.2, which is similar to the phase
portrait of the original Lorenz system. In the ﬁgure, one could also characterize a

and initial condition
(x0, y0, z0) = (10, 0, 10) at
t = 0. The effective order is
Σ = 2.97 [32]
set of points as a strange attractor, but is slightly deformed compared to the original
Lorenz chaotic attractor.
Note that it is rather time consuming to calculate Lyapunov exponents of system
(5). Using an implicit procedure of the TISEAN package [33], the largest Lyapunov
exponent of the above system was obtained, as λ ≈0.85, signifying the existence of
chaos.
Interestingly, some effective damping exists in system (5), when the effective
order Σ decreases. In Ref.[32], it is concluded that the decrease of the parameters
α, β, γ can result in a further decreasing of the largest Lyapunov exponent. At a
speciﬁc critical dimension, for any initial condition, the dynamics of the system have
some qualitative changes and ﬁnally become regular. The numerical solution and
synchronization of the fractional-order Lorenz system are studied in Ref.[16, 34].
The lowest effective order that still is able to generate chaos is found to be 2.91.
The corresponding parameter values are α ≈0.91, β = γ = 1, which indicates that
the ﬁrst linear differential equation of system (5) is less “sensitive” to the damping
than the other two equations.

Fractional-Order Chen System
Recall the Chen system [35]
⎧

˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = (c −a)x −xz + cy
˙z = xy −bz ,

where a = 35, b = 3, c = 28, with three equilibria and a chaotic attractor.

where αi is the fractional order with effective order Σ = α1 + α2 + α3. When α = 1,
the system becomes the original Chen system of integer order.
Numericalsimulationsonsystem(7)isstudiedinRef.[16].Forα = 0.9, 0.8, 0.7,
0.6, simulation results show that there exists a chaotic attractor with effective order
less than 3. In particular, when α = 0.6, no chaotic dynamics are found. However,
chaoticattractorsareclearlyfoundforthecasesofα = 0.9, 0.8, 0.7andtheirchaotic
portraits are very similar to the original Chen system. Therefore, one can conclude
that the lowest limit of the effective order for system (7) to be chaotic is Σ = 1.8 ∼
2.1.
The phase portrait of system (7), with effective order Σ = 2.1 and a = 35, b =
3, c = 40, is illustrated in Fig. 3.
Chaos and hybrid projective synchronization of the fractional-order Chen system
are studied in Ref.[34, 36, 37], where a fractional-order hyperchaotic Chen system
is also investigated.
2.4
Fractional-order Lü System
The integer-order Lü system is considered as the bridge between the Lorenz system
and the Chen system, according to the study proposed by Vanˇeˇcek and ˇCelikovský

206
X. Wang and G. Chen
[39]. Its fractional-order version using the Riemann-Liouville derivative is studied
by Lu et al. [40] and Deng et al. [41], which is described by

This fractional-order Lü system is discussed with q = (q1, q2, q3), including
chaos synchronization, topological horseshoe analysis and circuit realization. In
numerical simulations, bifurcation diagrams, numerical simulations and largest Lya-
punov exponents were computed [16, 41, 42].
System (8) has three equilibria:
E1 = (0, 0, 0),
E2 =

Through numerical simulations, with a = 36, b = 3, c = 20, one can obtain the
eigenvalues λ1 = −3, λ2 = 20, λ3 = −36 for saddle equilibrium E1, and with λ1 ≈
−22.6516, λ2,3 ≈1.8258 ± 13.6887 j for the saddle-focus equilibrium E2(7.7460,
7.7460, 20), and with λ1 ≈−22.6516, λ2,3 ≈1.8258 ± 13.6887 j for equilibrium
E3 (−7.7460, −7.7460, 20).
The lowest effective order for the fractional-order Lü system to generate chaos is
qi.0.9156, as can be calculated from the above eigenvalues.
Figure4 shows the phase portraits for effective order q1 = q2 = q3 = 0.95, with
simulation time 90s and time step h = 0.005, when a = 36, b = 3, c = 20.
2.5
Fractional-Order Rössler System
The original Rössler system [43] has seven terms, with two equilibria. It is described
by

Li and Chen [44] introduced the ﬁrst factional-order Rössler system, utilizing the
Riemann-Liouville derivative. This system has the following form:

In Ref.[44], all variables have the same fractional order α although different
variables (i.e., x, y, z) can be calculated with different fractional orders. Clearly,
system (12) is equivalent to the classical Rössler system if and only if the fractional
order α = 1.

Numerical solution and simulation result from the fractional Rössler system were
studied in Ref.[16, 44]. Considering the case with a = 0.5, b = 0.2 and c = 10,
system (12) has two equilibria:
E1 = (9.98998, −19.97997, 19.97997) ,
E2 = (0.10010, −0.20020, 0.20020) ,
with the corresponding eigenvalues λ1 = 0.47595, λ2,3 = 0.007017 ± 4.57910 for
the unstable focus-node equilibrium E1 and λ1 = −9.98800, λ2,3 = 0.249007 ±
0.96808 for the unstable saddle-focus equilibrium E2. With these eigenvalues, the
system is chaotic with the minimal effective order of α > 0.839.
Moreover, simulations were carried out using α = 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, respectively.
The simulation results indicate that there exists chaotic behavior in the fractional-
order Rössler system with effective order less than 3. In particular, Li and Chen [44]
found that the lowest effective order for system (12) to generate chaos is 2.4. Since
no chaotic behavior was found when α = 0.7, the lowest limit of the fractional order
should be between 0.7 and 0.8. Hence, 2.4 is the lowest effective dimension.
On the other hand, chaotic behaviors were found when α = 0.8, 0.9. Figure 5
shows the phase portrait for the case of α = 0.9, a = 0.4, which is very similar to
the integer-order Rössler system [43].
The dynamical behavior of system (11) is further investigated in [45]. Synchro-
nization and delayed feedback control of the fractional-order Rössler system were
studied in [46, 47]. Studies found that there are spiral-type and screw-type chaotic
attractors represented in the fractional-order Rössler system, while these types of
attractors were only found in the integer-order Rössler system. The bifurcation dia-
gram and largest Lyapunov exponent are analyzed, as well as the period-doubling
route to chaos in the fractional-order Rössler system.
Moreover,LiandChen[44]introducedafour-dimensionalmodelofthefractional-
order Rössler system after the 3D model (11). This hyperchaotic system is given by

Notice that such a fractional-order system (13) is equivalent to the integer-order

Rössler hyperchaotic system were also discussed in Ref.[16, 49].

Fractional-Order Liu System
Liu et al. [50] introduced the following system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −ax −ey2
˙y = by −kxz
˙z = −cz + mxy ,
(14)
which has chaotic behavior with parameters a = e = 1, b = 2.5, c = 5, k = m =
4, and initial condition (0.2, 0, 0.5). This system can be obtained from the classical
Shimizu–Morioka chaotic system via an appropriate transformation of state variables
and time rescaling [102].
Gejji and Bhalekar [51] introduced a fractional-order Liu system, as follows:

where 0 < α1, α2, α3 ≤1.
If α1 = α2 = α3 = α, the system (15) has a non-integer effective order.
System (14) has three real equilibria with corresponding eigenvalues λ1 =
−5, λ2 = 2.5, λ3 = −1 at equilibrium E1(0, 0, 0), eigenvalues λ1 = −4.3878,
λ2,3 = 0.4439 ± 3.3464i at E2(−0.8839, 0.9402, −0.6648), and λ1 = −4.3878,
λ2,3 = 0.4439 ± 3.3464i at E2(−0.8839, −0.9402, 0.6648). The equilibria E1 and
E2 are both saddle nodes of index 2. Therefore, there is a two-scroll chaotic attractor
in the fractional-order Liu system (15).

Now, consider an effective order of system (15), with α1 = α2 = α3 = α = 0.95

system, its characteristic equation can be obtained, as
λ285 + 3.5λ190 + 7.5λ95 + 50 = 0 ,
giving λ1,2 = 1.0128 ± 0.0153 j. Hence, the minimal order α is determined as α >
0.916. Figure 6 shows the phase trajectory of the fractional-order system.
On the other hand, by setting α1 = 1.0, α2 = 0.9 and α3 = 0.8, with parameters
a = e = 1, b = 2.5, c = 5, k = m = 4, the corresponding characteristic equation
of the fractional-order system is obtained as

The characteristic equation of system (16) is

A generalization of the predictor-corrector scheme [18] is used for the numerical

Simulation results show that a 1D 6-scroll chaotic system, with fractional order
α1 = 0.85, α2 = 0.9, α3 = 0.9 and parameters a = 2, b = 1, c = 0.6, d1 = 2,
k1 = 10, has Lyapunov exponents (LE1, LE2, LE3) = (0.2251, 0, −1.2143). A 2D
6 × 6-grid scroll chaotic system with fractional order α1 = 0.8, α2 = 0.9, α3 =
1.0 and parameters a = 2, b = 1, c = 0.5, d1 = 2, d2 = 1, k1 = k2 = 50 has Lya-
punov exponents (LE1, LE2, LE3) = (0.2131, 0, −1.5718). Moreover, a 3D 6 ×

order is α1 = α2 = α3 = 0.9 with parameters a = 2.2, b = 1.3, c = 0.6, d1 = 2.2,
d2 = 1.3, d3 = 0.6, ,1 = 100, k2 = k3 = 40. Lyapunov exponents for the three-

Based on the chaotic system of Lü et al. [58], Fei et al. [59] introduced a series of
trigonometric functions that can generate multi-directional multi-scroll fractional-
order chaos. Three models were proposed, for generating 1D, 2D, and 3D multi-scroll
chaotic attractors. Here, only the 3D fractional-order m × n × l-grid scroll chaotic
model is discussed, which is given by

In generating such a fractional-order 3D multi-scroll chaotic system (22), inverse
trigonometric function tan−1(x) was used in [60], instead of the piecewise-linear

which has ﬁve equilibria. By analyzing the Jacobian matrix and the corresponding
eigenvalues, Wu and Wang [11] found that the equilibrium E0(0, 0, 0) is an unstable
saddle point, while all the other four equilibria are unstable saddle-foci.
In numerical simulations, choose μ = 2 and a = 5 for system (24). The result
shows that the system can generate chaos with fractional order less than 3, namely,
0.911 ≤α ≤1. Especially, when α = 0.98, the phase portrait with the largest Lya-
punov exponent LEmax = 0.3104 is shown in Fig. 10a; when α = 0.911, the phase
portrait with the largest Lyapunov exponent LEmax = 0.1653 is shown in Fig.
10b. Moreover, system (24) has no chaotic behavior α < 0.911, as shown in Fig.
10c. Therefore, the minimal fractional order for the system to exhibit chaos is
α = 0.91 −0.911. The lowest effective order of system (24) is 2.733.

By selecting parameters a = 6, b = 12, c = 5, d = 1 and α = 0.9, system (25)
can display a rare four-wing chaotic attractor. A chaotic attractor is also found
when the effective order of the system is varied between 1.5 and 2.7. Hence, dif-
ferent chaotic behaviors occur when the system parameters a, b, c, d are varied. In
Ref.[61], some bifurcation diagrams and phase portraits are illustrated, in which the
four-wing chaotic attractor and two-wing attractor are included. Figure 11 shows a
typical case, which conﬁrms the chaotic dynamics of the system.
Moreover, the topological entropy of the system was investigated, to prove that
the topological entropy of system (25) is non-zero, and for an m-shift map g, one
has ent( f ) ≥ent(g) = log m, where m > 1.

In Ref.[62], system (26) was found to exhibit chaotic dynamics if and only if the
system fractional order satisﬁes 0.93 < αi ≤1, i = 1, 2, 3, according to the stability
theory in fractional calculus [63].

By selecting parameters a = 6, b = 16, d = 2, f = 1 and fractional orders
α1 = α2 = α3 = 0.92, the phase portrait of the system is shown in Fig. 12, which
exhibits no chaotic dynamics. Here, the numerical simulation results show the mini-
mal fractional order 0.92α ≤0.93. Therefore, the lowest effective order of the system
is 2.79.
Moreover, linear feedback control and synchronization of the factional-order sys-
tem (26) were investigated. A controller for stabilizing system (26) to its unsta-
ble equilibrium (4, 4, 16) was formulated by applying the linear feedback control
method. On the other hand, a nonlinear control method and the Lyapunov stability
theory were used to realize chaos synchronization.

By evaluating the eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian matrix at each equi-
librium, it was found that the equilibria are not saddle points of index 2 [66].
Hence, there is no analytical method to determine the minimal effective order of
the fractional-order system (27) for generating chaos. Also, the effect of fractional
derivation for the case of r = 2 can only be numerically investigated.
In Fig. 13, the phase portrait of the system with α = 0.92 is illustrated. By ana-
lyzing the dynamic behavior and the autocorrelation, it was found that the system
(27) converges to no equilibria when α = 0.92 or α = 0.87.

Next, several 4D examples of fractional-order hyperchaotic systems are discussed.

Fig. 14 Hyperchaotic
attractors of the
fractional-order hyperchaotic
system (29), with the
fractional order α = 0.9 [69]
Numerical simulation and synchronization were investigated in Ref.[69]. By
selecting a = 36, b = 3, c = 28, d = −16, k = 0.5, both system (29) and its
integer-order version are hyperchaotic, displaying the hyperchaotic behaviors. In
particular, this fractional-order hyperchaotic system can generate chaos with effec-
tive order less than 4. The Lyapunov exponents can be calculated by the familiar
Wolf algorithm.
When α = 0.9, there exhibits chaos with two largest Lyapunov exponents λ1 =
12.3014 and λ2 = 0.2318, as shown in Fig. 14. Moreover, hyperchaotic attractors
were found with the two largest Lyapunov exponents λ1 = 8.2130 and λ = 0.1015,
with the fractional order α = 0.72.
When α < 0.72, however, no hyperchaotic behaviors were found in system (29).
Therefore, the lowest limit of the fractional order for the hyperchaotic system (29) to
generate hyperchaotic dynamics is α = 0.71 −0.72, which indicates that the lowest
effective order for the system to yield hyperchaos is 2.88.

tion, the corresponding eigenvalues can calculated as given in Table 3. Moreover, the
results of numerical simulation and circuit simulation are in good agreement. With

Inspired by Refs.[44, 71–73], Gao et al. [74] constructed a fractional-order hyper-

where a, b, c, d, g are constant parameters and α is the fractional order satisfying
0 < α ≤1.
Since one cannot estimate the lowest order for the system (31) to exhibit
hyperchaotic behaviors, according to the necessary condition for the existence of
chaotic attractor in a fractional-order system [75, 76], numerical method was used
in Ref.[44] with the predictor-corrector algorithm under condition a = 25, b =
60, c = 40, d = 4, g = 5. When α = 0.95, the four Lyapunov exponents are
obtained as λ1 = 2.3057, λ2 = 0.1424, λ3 = −0.4631, λ4 = −47.0718.
Therefore,thelowestlimitofthefractionalorderforthesystemtohavehyperchaos
is α = 0.83 −0.84 based on simulation results. Thus, the hyperchaotic behavior does
occur in the fractional-order hyperchaotic system with order less than 4. Figure 16
illustrates the phase portrait of the system, with α = 0.95 and a = 25, b = 60, c =
40, d = 4, g = 5.

Fractional-Order Systems with an Inﬁnite Number of
Equilibria
Motivated by the research on chaotic systems with an inﬁnite number of equilibria
[67, 77–79], Kingni et al. [80] presented a 3D fractional-order autonomous system
with an inﬁnite number of equilibria. Based on the predictor-corrector scheme [18]
and using the Caputo derivative, this system is described by

where α is the fractional order satisfying 0 < α ≤1.
Through numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the fractional-order sys-
tem (32) has an inﬁnite number of equilibria, located on a line E1(0, y∗, 0) and a
hyperbolic curve E2( 1
y∗, y∗, 0).
The corresponding characteristic equations for both equilibrium curves E1 and
E2 are:
λ[λ2 −b(y∗)2λ + 1] = 0
(33)
and
λ[λ2 −b(y∗)2λ −1 −4aδ(z∗)( 1
y∗)2] = 0 .
(34)
Thus, eigenvalues of system (32) can be calculated and it was found that two equi-
libria E1 and E2 are both not saddle points of index 2 [75]. Therefore, one cannot
determined the minimal fractional order of the system (32) to generate hyperchaos.

By simulation, the largest Lyapunov exponent of the system (35) is found to be
0.8939, which implies that the system has chaotic behaviors. Figure 18 shows the
chaotic attractor of the system. However, when α = 1, the system becomes integer-

where a, b, c are non-negative constants and αi are the fractional orders satisfying
0 < αi ≤1, i = 1, 2, ).
The solution of system (37) is invariant under the transformation T (x, y, z) →
(−x, −y, z), thus any non-invariant orbit has its “twin” orbit in the system [82].
The equilibria of this fractional-order system are given by

and its corresponding characteristic equation is
λ3 + (a + c)λ2 + bλ + 2ab = 0 ,
which has three roots with negative real parts. According to the Routh-Hurwitz
criterion, the equilibria E± are asymptotically stable.
Numerical simulations were performed using the predictor-corrector scheme [18].
When parameters a = 10, b = 100, c = 11.2, with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) =
(0.98, −1.82, −0.49), and the fractional orders α1 = α2 = α3 = 0.9999, the system
has the largest Lyapunov exponents as shown in Fig. 19. The effective order of the
system in this case is  = 2.9997 < 3.
To obtain the lowest effective order of the system, the fractional orders αi,
i = 1, 2, 3, are re-set. Choosing α1 = α2 = 1, the minimal fractional order α3
for the system to generate chaos is 0.9943. Also, taking α1 = α3 = 1, one has
0.99 ≤α2 ≤1; while taking α2 = α3 = 1, one has 0.8485 ≤α1 ≤1. Therefore, the

the ﬁrst 2,000 data points are omitted [82]
Ref.[20, 83]. In Ref.[84], another 3D fractional-order chaotic system with only
one stable equilibrium was introduced.

Figure 20 shows the phase portrait of the system (38), with initial condition
(x0, y0, z0) = (−1.2, 1, 1) and fractional order α = 0.958. Simulation results give
the largest Lyapunov exponents as LEs = 0.0022.
The system (38) shows chaos with only one stable equilibrium, for the fractional
order varying between 0.958 and 1.

The system (39) has two equilibria:

which are stable for b > a according to the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.
Applying the Adam-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method, proposed in
Refs. [18, 63, 87], numerical solutions were performed. Figure 21 shows the chaotic
attractor in system (39), with a = 14.1, b = 15, e = 90 and α1 = 0.98, α2,3 = 0.99.
Two equilibria were observable in Fig. 21.
In a further study, synchronization schemes including the full-state hybrid pro-
jective synchronization and the inverse full-state hybrid projective synchronization
were investigated in Refs.[86, 88].

Fractional-Order Systems without Equilibria
Chaos in fractional-order systems without equilibria will be studied in both 3D and
4D models, and several examples will be discussed. Since there is no equilibria in
these systems, the Melnikov and Šil’nikov methods cannot be used to mathematically
verify the existence of chaos. Hence, the numerical predictor-corrector schemes will
be used.

3D Examples
6.1.1
Example 1
Utilizing the Caputo derivative, Cafagna and Grassi [89] ﬁrst introduced an 3D
“elegant” fractional-order chaotic system without equilibria, based on Refs.[90, 91].

where αi is the fractional order satisfying 0 < α < 1 and parameter a ̸= 0.
This system is considered “elegant” since its corresponding differential equations
contain very few terms, only the necessary ones. It can be easily veriﬁed that the
system (40) has chaos without equilibria [89, 92].

the “elegant” fractional-order
system (40), with parameter
a = −0.757, initial
condition (0, 3, 0.1) and
derivative order α = 0.98
[89]
Based on the method in Ref.[93], a transformation is applied to calculate the
Lyapunov exponents of system (40) yielding
λ1 = 0.013,
λ2 = 0,
λ3 = −3.018 .
By setting parameter a = −0.757 with initial condition (0,3,0.1) and derivative order
α = 0.98, the phase portrait of the chaotic system is shown in Fig. 22. The minimal
effective order of system (40) to generate chaos, in the absence of equilibria, is 2.94.
InRef. [94], the observation-based synchronization of system (40) is discussed.

where a, b are positive parameters and α is the fractional order satisfying 0 < α < 1.
Note that the system (41) is proposed based on the integer-order N E8 model
listed in Ref.[91]. There are no equilibria in this fractional-order system. Moreover,
a rotational symmetry with respect to the z-axis is founded in system (41), as it is
invariant under the coordinate transformation (x, y, z) →(−x, −y, z).

dition (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0.1, 0), and α = 0.9 [95]
By selecting a = 1.5, b = 1.3 with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0.1, 0) and
α = 0.9, chaotic behavior can be observed, as illustrated in Fig. 23. Applying the
Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method [18], it can be found that there is a route from
non-chaotic dynamics to chaotic ones as the parameter b decreases from 1.2 to 1.4,
in the case of a = 1.5 and α = 0.9.
By applying the numerical method reported in Ref.[96], the largest Lyapunov
exponent is obtained as 0.1374, for the case shown in Fig. 23. Also, circuit imple-
mentation, chaos control and synchronization were studied in Ref.[95].

dition (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0) for any value of α in (0.92, 1], its Lyapunov exponents
have the signs of (+, 0, −). Therefore, this 3D fractional-order system is chaotic.
Phase portrait of the chaotic attractor of the system, with α = 0.92, is shown in Fig.
24. Numerical simulation results indicate that the lowest effective order of the system
(42) to generate chaos is 2.73.
Moreover, the equilibria and the corresponding eigenvalues of the system are
shown in Table 4. The system is veriﬁed as a chaotic system with hidden attractors
since all their equilibria, as listed in Table 4, are purely imaginary.

4D Examples
6.2.1
Example 4
The 4D fractional-order system proposed by Li et al. [98] was the ﬁrst 4D fractional-
order chaotic system without equilibria.
The Caputo derivative is adopted, and an improved version of the Adams-
Bashforth-Moulton numerical algorithm is applied in the investigation. This 4D
fractional-order chaotic system is described by

where a, b, k are positive constants and αi is the fractional order satisfying 0 < α <

Through calculating the Lyapunov exponent spectrum for varying α, the lowest
effective order of this 4D fractional-order system to have chaos, in the absence of
equilibria, is 3.28. Figure 25 shows the chaotic attractor for the case of α = 0.9, with
step size h = 0.005 and initial condition (x0, y0.z0, w0) = (0.12, 0.2, 0.11, 0.3) in
simulations.
Moreover, a one-way coupling conﬁguration was used, with a drive system and a
response system, to investigate the synchronization of system (43) in Ref.[98].

with the fractional order satisfying 0 < α < 1.
Note that the integer-order version of system (44), with α = 1, has no chaotic
behavior, since numerical simulations show that the largest Lyapunov exponents of
the integer-order system, with α = 1, are (0, 0, −0, 011, −4.99).
When α = 0.9, the largest Lyapunov exponent of system (44) is 1.6267; when
α = 0.8, the largest Lyapunov exponent is 0.0218. The phase portrait of the system
is shown in Fig. 26. The lowest effective order for this system to generate chaos is
3.2.

where the Caputo derivative is used, with real parameters a, b, c, in which the
fractional order satisﬁes 0 < α < 1. This system has no equilibria for any values of
parameters a, b, c.
By the predictor-corrector algorithm [18], the system (45) is simulated. By
selecting the constant parameters a = 8, b = −2.5, c = −30, with initial condition
(x0, y0, z0, w0) = (0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1) and α = 0.96, the Lyapunov exponent spec-
trum of the system is obtained:
λ1 = 0.89, λ2 = 0.21, λ3 = 0, λ4 = −1.54 .
indicating that hyperchaos exists in this setting. The phase portrait of the hyperchaotic
attractor is shown in Fig. 27.
Note that the plot of system (45) is in perfect agreement with the results given
in Ref.[101] for its integer-order version. Further dynamical analysis of system (45)
was also performed in Ref.[100].

Memristive Chaotic Systems with Hidden

Introduction
The concept of memristor was ﬁrst introduced by Chua in 1971 [1]. Subsequently,
solid-state implementation of memristor was fabricated by the research group
of Hewlett–Packard [2]. This momentous development is successfully attracting
tremendous attention to an intensive and extensive study of the memristor.
As a fundamental nonlinear circuit element with adjustable resistance or conduc-
tance in memory, the memristor is a passive two-terminal component, which has
added a new dimension to the new development of analogous circuit designs and
engineering applications. Many memristor emulators with different nonlinearities
and many new properties have been proposed [3–7]. In most cases, memristor-based
circuits or systems were constructed by introducing one or more of memristor into
some existing linear or nonlinear circuits or systems, to replace its original self-
variable resistor or linear coupling resistor, resulting in such as the new memristive
Chua-like circuit [8], memristive Wien-bridge circuit [9], memristive jerk system
[5], memristive Lü system [10], a memristive circuit based on active band-pass ﬁlter
[11], and so forth.
Naturally, constructing a memristive system that can generate hidden attractors
is interesting and important but also challenging. This chapter reviews this subject
of hidden attractors in memristive chaotic systems, which were developed in recent
years.

Memristive Chua-Like Circuits
Many memristive chaotic circuits are designed based on Chua’s circuit. Some exam-
ples are collected in this section.
2.1
Memristive Chua’s Circuit
In [8], a novel memristive chaotic circuit is presented. The circuit is implemented with
a ﬁrst-order memristive diode bridge, used to replace Chua’s diode in the classical
Chua’s circuit. The circuit can generate self-excited attractors and hidden attractors
in different parameter settings.
The memristor-based Chua’s circuit and its corresponding generalized memristor
are shown in Figs.1 and 2, respectively.
The mathematical model of the memristor shown in Fig.2 is described by
i = g(vC, v) = 2ISeρvCsinh(ρv)

where ρ = 1/(2nVT ), VT and IS represent the emission coefﬁcient, thermal voltage
of the diode, and reverse saturation current, respectively.

When the new circuit parameters are chosen as listed in Table 1, three equilibria
can be easily obtained as
S0 = (0, 0, 0, 0) ,
S1 = (0.8324, 0, 0.00042, 0.0343)
S2 = (−0.8324, 0, −0.00042, 0.0343) .
The four eigenvalues are obtained as
S0 : λ1 = 5939.07.λ2 = −1250.15, λ3,4 = −1250.15 ± j5024.42
S1,2 : λ1,2 = −109.55 ± j9394.59, λ3 = −1191.43, λ4 = −23830.48
It can be easily veriﬁed that S0 is an unstable saddle point and S1,2 are two stable
saddle-foci.
When the initial conditions are set as v1(0) = 0.01V, v2(0) = 0.01V, i3(0) =
0A, and vc(0) = 0V , the memristive Chua’s circuit is chaotic with a double-scroll
chaotic attractor, as shown in Fig.3. The four Lyapunov exponents are LE1 =
402.33, LE2 = −39.29, LE3 = −1126.54 and LE4 = −15796.97, respectively.
Clearly, the chaotic attractors are not excited from unstable equilibria, thus the cir-
cuit has hidden attractors.

Modiﬁed Memristive Chua’s Circuit
Chen [12] proposed a modiﬁed memristive Chua’s circuit with hidden dynamics.
This memristive circuit is constructed by substituting Chua’s diode with an improved
voltage-controlled memristor.
The modiﬁed memristive Chua’s circuit has three equilibria, including one zero
saddlepointandtwonon-zerosaddle-foci.Whenappropriateparametersareselected,
the two non-zero saddle-foci are stable. In this case, hidden attractors exist.
The circuit is shown in Fig.4, where the equivalent realization circuit of voltage-
controlled memristor is marked by a dotted-line box.
The mathematical model of the memristor is given by

Let the right-hand side of system (2) be zero. Then, three equilibria can be obtained
as

where
ξ =

(g1g2)−1 −[g1g2(R + r)/R3]−1 .
Obviously, for any given parameters of the non-ideal active memristor, the distri-
butions of the two non-zero equilibria in system (2) are determined by the circuit
parameter R.
Fix the circuit parameters to be L = 12.6 mH, r = 2 , C1 = 6.8 nF, C2 = 68 nF,
R1 = 4 k, C0 = 1 nF, R2 = 10 k, g1 = 1, g2 = 0.1, R3 = 1.43 k, R4 = R5 = 2
k, R = 2.177 k, and R = 2.2 k, respectively. Then the two non-zero equilibria
1S1,2, 2S1,2 and their corresponding four eigenvalues can be obtained as
1S1,2 = (±0.7514
± 6.8 × 10−4
± 3.4 × 10−4

1S0 : λ1 = 41275, λ2,3 = −6451 ± j30965, λ4 = −100000 ,

1S1,2 : λ1,2 = −1.34 ± j33505, λ3,4 = −53486 ± j67052 ;
2S1,2 = (±0.749

2S0 : λ1 = 41848, λ2,3 = −6349 ± j31083, λ4 = −100000 ,
(4)
2S1,2 : λ1,2 = −86.73 ± j33563, λ3,4 = −53365 ± j68046 .
It can be seen that, for the two speciﬁed parameters of R = 2.177 k and R = 2.2
k, the zero equilibrium is always an unstable saddle point, whereas the two non-zero
equilibria are stable saddle-foci.

Hidden attractors generated from this memristive circuit at R = 2.177 k and
R = 2.2 k, which were numerically found, are depicted in Fig.5.
2.3
Memristive Self-oscillating Circuit
Based on the three-dimensional self-excited oscillations, Bao et al. [13, 14], con-
structed a three-dimensional memristive self-oscillating circuit by introducing a non-
ideal voltage-controlled memristor to replace a linear coupling resistor of the original
circuit.
The simpliﬁed mathematical model of the new circuit is described by
	 ¨x = (x + x2 −αx4)˙x −ω2
0x
˙z = β −x2 ,
(5)
where α, β and ω are real parameters.
Let y = ˙x. Then, system (5) can be converted to a system of ﬁrst-order ordinary
differential equations as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = (x + x2 −αx4)y −ω2
0x
˙z = β −x2 ,
(6)
Where ω0 represents the oscillation frequency, and α and β are two control param-
eters.
The circuit realization of system (6) is shown in Fig.6.

Fig. 6
Realization circuit of system (6) and the memristive self-oscillating circuit
The memristive self-oscillating circuit can be implemented by using a non-ideal
voltage-controlled memristor to replace the linear coupling resistor, which is con-
nected with the inverting input of the operational ampliﬁer U2, as shown in Fig.7.
An equivalent realization circuit of the non-ideal voltage-controlled memristor is
displayed in Fig.7, and the mathematical model of the voltage-controlled memristor
is given by
	i = W(vw)vx = (a + b|vw|)vx
˙vw = vx −vw .
(7)
The dimensionless equations of the memristive self-oscillating circuit can be
easily derived as

(8)
Fix the system parameters α = 0.5, β = 0.9, a = 1 and b = 0.1. The oscillation
frequency parameter is set as the variable parameter.
Let the right-hand side of (8) be zero, the system equilibria can be obtained. But
there exist no real solutions. It means that there are no (real) equilibria in this system.
So, the chaotic attractor generated by this system is hidden.
When w0 = 2.035, the oscillating system is chaotic, with two coexisting hidden
attractors. The phase diagram on the x-y plane and the x-z plane were displayed in
Fig.8a, b, respectively, where the red attractor was starting from the initial conditions
(2, 0, 0, 0) and the blue attractor was stating from (−2, 0, 0, 0). The corresponding
Lyapunov exponents are LE1 = 0.0419, LE2 = 0, LE3 = −0.3705, and LE4 =
−1.2118, respectively.

Memristive Hyperjerk Circuit
A memristive hyperjerk circuit with hidden chaotic attractors is considered.
Prousalis [15] introduced a new hyperjerk memristive system with hidden attrac-
tors, which has an inﬁnite number of equilibria.
Recall the memristive jerk system:
	 fm = (1 + xm)um
˙xm = um ,
(9)

where fm, xm and um denote the state, output and input of system, respectively.
Based on the memristive system (9), the following hyperjerk dynamical system
is introduced [15]:
⎧

˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = w
˙w = −z −aw −bz2wf ,
(10)
where a, b are real parameters, and x = xm, y = um, f = fm = (1 + x)y.
By setting the right-hand side of the hyperjerk memristive system to be zero,
one can ﬁnd inﬁnitely many equilibria, E(x, 0, 0, 0). According to [15], this chaotic
hyperjerk memristive system has hidden attractors, because it is impossible to verify
the chaotic attractors by choosing arbitrary initial conditions in any vicinities of
the unstable equilibria. With a = 0.5, b = 0.1, the system (10) has four Lyapunov
exponents L1 = 0.08945, L2 = 0, L3 = 0, L4 = −0.89978. The phase portrait of
the hidden attractor is depicted in Fig.9.

Hidden Attractors in Memristive Hyperchaotic Systems
4.1
4D Memristive Hyperchaotic System
Based on the memristive system [16], Pham et al. [17] introduced a memristive
element in the following form:
	 f = (1 + 0.24w2 −0.0016w4)y
˙w = y .
(12)
Using the memristive element (12), a novel four-dimensional system is proposed as
follows:

(13)
where a and b are positive real parameters and f is the output of the memristive
element (12).
When b = 0, system (13) has a line of equilibria, E(0, 0, 0, wm).
When a = 5, b = 0 and the initial conditions are chosen as (0, 0.01, 0.01, 0), the
memristivesystem(13)exhibitshyperchaos.ThecorrespondingLyapunovexponents
are L1 = 0.1364, L2 = 0.0071, L3 = 0, L4 = −10.8564. This hyperchaotic sys-
tem can be considered as a dynamical system with hidden attractor because it is
impossible to verify the chaotic attractor by choosing arbitrary initial conditions in
any vicinities of the unstable equilibria.
When b ̸= 0, the system (13) has no equilibria, so all the attractors generated from
system (13) are hidden.
When b = 0.001 and the initial conditions are chosen as (0, 0.01, 0.01, 0), the
system exhibits periodic, chaotic, and hyperchaotic dynamics in the region of 1 ≤
a ≤6. The corresponding Lyapunov exponents are plotted in Fig.11.
When a = 5, the system generates a hyperchaotic attractor, as shown in Fig.12.
An equivalent circuit diagram of the above memristive element and the circuit
implementation of system (13) are shown in Figs.13 and 14, respectively.

Using a ﬂux-controlled memristor to substitute a coupling resistor in the real-

chaotic system with coexisting inﬁnitely many hidden attractors is proposed by Bao
et al. [19], which is illustrated in Fig.15a.
For the memristor W, the relationship between the terminal voltage v and the
terminal current i is described by
i = W(ϕ)v, ϕ = v ,

When Ra = R, dα = R/RC and dβ = 0.0025R/Rb, the system (16) can be
transformed to a dimensionless form, as follows:

where W(w) = α + βw2, a, b, c, d are positive parameters, and u is a non-zero
control constant.
By setting the right-hand side of system (17) to zero, the resulting equations have
no real solutions, so the system does not have any equilibrium. Thus, the attractors
generated from system (17) are all hidden.
With a = 35, b = 35, d = 40, u = α = 1, β = 0.02, and the initial condition
(0.1, 0, 0, 0), the memristive system (17) generates a double-scroll attractor, as

5D Memristive Hyperchaotic Systems
Wang [20] proposed two kinds of ﬂux-controlled smooth multi-piecewise quadratic
nonlinearity memristor models, and used them to design a memristive multi-scroll
Chua’s circuit, which can generate 2N-scroll and (2N + 1)-scroll chaotic attractors.
Inspired by Wang [20], two kinds of non-ideal voltage-controlled multi-piecewise
cubic nonlinear memristors and their mathematical models are introduced here.
By adding the memristor into a 4-D chaotic system, a new 5-D memristive hyper-
chaotic system is obtained. The relationship between the terminal voltage v and the
terminal current i of the meristor is deﬁned as
	i = W(w)v = (p + q f 2(w))v
˙u = v −f (w) ,
(18)
where f (w) is the memristive internal state variable function.
The ﬁrst kind of memristive memductance is described by

By adding the memristor into the circuit of a 4D chaotic system, a novel 5D

have no real solutions, so system (22) has no equilibria. Thus, all attractors generated
from system (22) are hidden.
When the parameters are ﬁxed as a = 0.5, b = 0.1, c = 3.8, p = 0.1, n =
0.03, k = 0.2, and the initial condition is chosen as (0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1), the memris-

the memristive system (22) is hyperchaotic.

A ﬂux-controlled memristor was considered, where the relation between terminal

where W(ϕ) = g + hϕ2. Based on that, the new memristive system is written as

[21]
The equilibria of the system can be obtained by setting the right-hand side of the

⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
ay = 0

y −ez = 0

v = 0 ,
(24)
where the parameter k is a key factor to determine the type of the solutions. There
are two scenarios.
Case A: when k ̸= 0, clearly the system has no solutions.
Case B: when k = 0, the equilibria of the system are (n/2d, 0, 0, 0, ϕ∗), where
the parameter n is an integer and ϕ∗is an arbitrary real constant. In this case, the
system has multiple lines of equilibria.
From the above analysis, one can see that the attractors in the system are all
hidden.
Now, consider Case A. It is worth noting that, because of the existence of the
sine function in Eqs.(23), the system’s nonlinearity is unbound. Thus, the number
of multi-scroll hidden attractors and multi-wing hidden attractors are affected by the
transient time.
The system parameters are chosen as a = 0.25, b = 0.4, c = 2, d = 0.5, e =
0.5, g = 15, h = 0.01, and k = 0.05. Set the initial condition be (0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.2)
and the transient simulation time be t = 3000. The system can generate 4-scroll
hidden attractors on the x-y plane and generate 8-wing hidden attractors on the
y-u phase plane, simultaneously. The corresponding phase portraits are shown in
Fig.20a, b, respectively. When the transient time is changed to t = 5000, 7-scroll

Applications of Memristive Chaotic Systems
Due to the unusual rich dynamics of chaotic systems, they are widely applied in
various ﬁelds, such as neural networks, image encryption, and secure communica-
tions, to name a few. This section introduces some applications of memristive chaotic
systems.
Pham et al. [24] presented a memristive system with hidden attractors, and used it
for image encryption. Using a memristor, a new memristive system was introduced
in [17], as follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙x = −10 −ay −yz
˙y = −6x + 1.2xz + 0.1h(w, y) + b
˙z = −z −1.2xy

(29)
where a and b are two positive parameters, and h(w, y) is the output of the memristive
element described by
	 h(w, y) = (1 + 0.24w2 −0.0016w4)y
˙w = y .
(30)
When b ̸= 0, the system (30), which has no equilibria, has hidden attractors.

image; c Presentation of the decrypted image
When b = 0, the system (30) has an inﬁnite number of equilibria, E(0, 0, 0, w).
The system belongs to a new class of systems with hidden attractors [25].
When a = 5, b = 0, and the initial condition is (0, 0.01, 0.01, 0), the mem-
ristive system (30) is hyperchaotic, with Lyapunov exponents L1 = 0.1364, L2 =
0.0071, L3 = 0, L4 = −10.8564.
Then, the above system is applied to the encryption scheme of Gao and Chen
[26]. The encryption procedure has two steps, as illustrated in Fig.24.
Step 1 is to shufﬂe the pixel positions of the plain image, using a chaotic map, so
as to derive an image total shufﬂing matrix, Phl
i, j.
Step 2 is to encrypt the shufﬂed image, based on a hyperchaotic system. Here,
the hyperchaotic memristive system (30) is used to group the states (B1, B2, B3) to
perform encryption, and then the XOR operation is applied between three bytes of
the image total shufﬂing matrix Phl
i, j and three bytes of the selected group of three
states (B1, B2, B3).
Finally, continue performing the above two encryption steps until the whole image
is encrypted [26].
By applying the above image encryption scheme to the plain-image as shown in
Fig.25a, and setting a secret key, the encrypted image is obtained as illustrated in
Fig.25b, while the decrypted image is shown in Fig.25c. Cryptanalysis was also
performed in [26].

Multi-stability and Extreme Multi-stability of
Memristive Chaotic Systems
In recent years, considerable attention has been attracted to chaotic systems with
multi-stability. Multi-stability or multiple attractors mean that two or more attractors
are generated simultaneously from the same set of parameters in a system with differ-
ent initial conditions, which is an unusual but very interesting nonlinear phenomenon,
which has become an important research topic in recent years.
Multi-stability commonly exists in many nonlinear systems, such as power sys-
tems [27], biological systems [28], electrochemical models [29], food chains [30],
and neural networks [31–34]. Notably, the appearance of multiple coexisting attrac-
tors (multi-stability) indicates an extra source of randomness in chaotic systems, with
great potential for chaos-based applications such as secure communication and ran-
dom signal generation. Such systems have a rich diversity of states, offering a great
ﬂexibility for different purposes of applications [35–41]. For example, if a chaotic
system with coexisting attractors is inﬂuenced by noise or other disturbances, it
can switch between different models to keep its normal operation. However, multi-
stability may not be desirable in many situations, therefore needs to be controlled.
Especially, when the number of coexisting attractors generated from a chaotic system
rises to inﬁnity, the coexistence of inﬁnitely many attractors, depending on initial
conditions and is named extreme multi-stability, are usually undesirable [42, 43].
Very recently, even mega-stability is being studied, which means that a system gen-
erates an inﬁnite number of coexisting nested attractors [44, 45].
In this section, a rough classiﬁcation on systems with multi-stability is presented;
that is, systems with self-excited multi-stability [46–57], systems with self-excited
extreme multi-stability [11, 58–73], systems with hidden multi-stability [12, 74–81],
systems with hidden extreme multi-stability [19, 82–86], and systems with mega-
stability [45, 87]. But the focus is on the multi-stability and extreme multi-stability
in memristive chaotic systems.

with W(u) = m + 3nu2.
It can be easily veriﬁed that this system has a line of equilibria and all the equi-
libria are unstable. Therefore, the resulting attractors are all self-excited attractors.
For example, when the parameters are set as a = 4, b = 6, c = 10, d = 5, e = 0.48,
k = 0.01, m = 1 and 3n = 0.03, system (32) generates coexisting two-wing chaotic
attractors from initial conditions (1, 10, 0, 0) and (−1, 10, 0, 0), respectively, as plot-

iL2, w = q, C = 1 and d = v0/L2, the dimensionless form of system (35) is pre-
sented as follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙x = y −z
˙y = −ax + cy
˙z = b(x −z(α + 3βw2)) −d
˙w = z ,
(36)
where a, b, c and d are positive parameters. When the system parameters are set
to a = 1, b = 5, c = 0.65, d = 0.001, α = −0.4, β = 0.8, and the initial condi-
tions are set as (0.01, 0, 0, w(0)), system (36) can exhibit extreme multi-stability for
different values of w(0), as displayed in Fig.31.

Chaotic Systems with Mega-stability
Sprott et al. [44] presented a chaotic system with an inﬁnite number of nested coex-
isting attractors, referred to as the mega-stability.
The system is expressed as
	 ˙x = y
˙y = −(0.33)2y + y cos(x) + sin(0.73t)

Introduction
During the last two decades, there has been an immense effort with success towards
a new class of minimal chaotic ﬂows. Since Poincaré deduced some of the qualitative
properties of chaotic systems, including sensitive dependence on initial conditions
[1], Lorenz [2], Rössler [3] and Chua [4, 5] had identiﬁed some very simple examples
with quadratic or piecewise linear nonlinearities.
Lately, Sprott [6] found fourteen chaotic systems with six terms and only one
quadratic nonlinearity, and ﬁve cases with ﬁve terms with two quadratic nonlinear-
ities, which were simpler than the other three-dimensional autonomous quadratic
chaotic systems. These Sprott models can be written in the following form:
...x = J(¨x, ˙x, x) ,
(1)
where J is a jerk function, with the third parametric derivative ...x of the displacement
x, namely the time derivative of acceleration, known as a “jerk” [7].
To deﬁne the jerk function, set an system of n coupled ﬁrst-order ODEs that is
not explicitly dependent on time t:
˙x = V (x),

where x = (x, y, z)T and x(t) represents its orbit in the phase space.
Referring to [8], any nth-order autonomous ODE that is given in an explicit form
can be recast to an n-dimensional system of dynamical equations. In fact, one can
transform the function (1) to the dynamical system (2) by selecting
˙x = v , ˙v = a , and ˙a = J(x, v = ˙x, a = ¨x) .
Apparently, the jerk systems are a restricted class of third-order ODEs, and the jerk
function must depend explicitly on x. Particularly, for some constraints, the function
(1) is interpreted as the derivative of a one-dimensional Newtonian equation with a
memory term depending on the history of motion. Meanwhile, it must satisfy the
condition that the acceleration ¨x enters only linearly into the jerky dynamics [9].
Gottlieb [10] pointed out that the Sprott A system (see Table 1 of Chap. ‘Introduc-
tion’) can be recast to the jerk form, and posed the question of ﬁnding the simplest
jerk function that still exhibits chaos.
Another fundamental question was also raised: what is the characteristic of a
three-dimensional dissipative system with less than ﬁve quadratic terms that can
generate chaos?
In response to Gottlieb’s challenge, Sprott [6] proposed two jerk systems with
three terms and two quadratic nonlinearities [11], and one simple system with three
terms and a single quadratic nonlinearity [12]. At the same time, minimal polynomial
dissipative and conservative jerky dynamical systems that can generate chaos had
also been constructed by Linz [13], on the basis of the Sprott R system (see Table 1
of Chap. ‘Introduction’) [6], the Lorenz system [2] and the Rössler [3] model, but in
somewhat more complicated formulations.
These jerk dynamical systems are the simplest ones with a single quadratic non-
linearity since Fu and Heidel [14], with a technical correction by Gascon [15]. It had
been proved that there are no other dissipative systems that can generate chaos with
fewer than ﬁve terms.
Since the jerky dynamics show all major features of the vector ﬁeld and are
conceptually simple, they might serve an important role in further studying chaotic
and non-chaotic dynamical behaviors, including various routes to chaos.
This chapter reviews the development of jerk functions that generate chaos. Start-
ing from the simple Sprott system, symbolic jerky dynamical systems found in the
last two decades are introduced. Then, a systematic method for constructing such a
jerk system is illustrated. Finally, several related topics such as the hyperjerk chaotic
system, the coexistence of multiple attractors, and the jerk system with hidden attrac-
tors are discussed.

Chaotic Jerk Systems with Hidden Attractors

Simple Jerk Function that Generates Chaos
2.1
Simplest Jerk Function for Generating Chaos
Sprott [6] proposed fourteen algebraically simple three-dimensional ODEs with
chaotic solutions (see Table 1 of Chap. ‘Introduction’). These systems have six terms
with one nonlinearity. Particularly, one of these cases is volume-conservative, while
the others are dissipative.
Concurrently, Hoover [16] pointed out that the conservative Sprott A system (see
Table 1 of Chap. ‘Introduction’), namely
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x + yz
˙z = 1 −y2.
(3)
is a special case of the Nose-Hoover thermostated dynamical system, that exhibits
time-reversible Hamiltonian chaos.
System (3) can be transformed to an explicit jerk version [10]:
...x + ˙x3 −¨x(x + ¨x)/˙x = 0 .
(4)
Sprott I system (see Table 1 of Chap. ‘Introduction’) can also be also recast into the
jerk form:
...x + ¨x + 1
5 ˙x + 5˙x2 + 2
5x = 0 .
(5)
Though the explicit ODE can be cast into a system of n coupled ﬁrst-order ODEs,
it is not common for the conservative case to do so. In fact, the ﬁnal would ODE
look quite different after if it was recast into the jerk form. Therefore, Gottlieb [10]
asked the question “What is the simplest jerk function that gives chaos?”
Answer 1
Based on the Lorenz system [2] and the Rössler system [3], two simpler jerk functions
were introduced by Linz [13]. Subsequently, the Lorenz model can be reduced to the
jerk form, as
...x + [1 + σ + b −˙x/x]¨x + [b(1 + σ + x2) −(1 + σ)˙x/x]˙x −bσ(r −1 −x2)x = 0 ,
(6)
which has eight terms with multiple nonlinearities.
The jerk Rössler model reads

A = 2.017, on the x-v plane
[11]
...x + [c −ε + εx −˙x]¨x + [1 −εc −(1 + ε2)x + ε ˙x]˙x + (εx + c)x + ε = 0 ,
(7)
which is a rather complicated quadratic polynomial with ten terms. System (7) gen-
erates chaos when ε = 0.2 and c = 5.7.
In addition, Linz also modiﬁed the Sprott R system (see Table 1 of Chap. ‘Intro-
duction’):
...x + ¨x −x ˙x + ax + b = 0 ,
(8)
which is also a polynomial but with only ﬁve terms and one quadratic nonlinearity.
Interestingly, its chaotic attractor is a folded band, which is similar to the Rössler
attractor, for a = 0.9 and b = 0.4 in system (8).
Answer 2
Obviously, new cases should be at least as simple as the 19 Sprott system shown in
Table 1 of Chap. ‘Introduction’.
To ﬁnd chaotic solutions with the fewest non-zero coefﬁcients and with the fewest
nonlinearities, inspired by system (4) and (5) Sprott [11] proposed the most general
second-degree polynomial jerk function:
J = (a1 + a2x + a3 ˙x + a4 ¨x)¨x + (a5 + a6x + a7 ˙x)˙x + (a8 + a9x)x + a10 .
(9)
Through numerically detecting chaos by randomly choosing three or four of the
coefﬁcients from a1 to a10, and by using its characteristic sensitive dependence on
initial conditions, or calculating the Lyapunov exponents by Wolf’s scheme [17],
Sprott concluded that chaos indeed exists in some algebraically very simple jerk
systems.
Subsequently, the simplest dissipative chaotic system based on system (9) was
found with all coefﬁcients equal to zero except for a1, a7 and a8. Additionally, one
coefﬁcient can be arbitrary while the other two can be set to unity without loss of
generality. Thus, one may select a1 = −A, a7 = 1 and a8 = −1, so that the jerk
function is speciﬁcally

Chaotic Jerk Systems with Hidden Attractors
277
...x + A ¨x −˙x2 + x = 0 ,
(10)
which contains only one single dissipative quadratic nonlinearity.
Function (10) is a special case of function (5), with the ˙x term absent, and so can
be written as an equivalent system of three equations having a total of ﬁve terms:
˙x = v , ˙v = a , ˙a = −Aa + v2 −x .
Numerical simulation shows that the bounded solutions to function (10) is
given by 2.017... < A < 2.082..., the largest Lyapunov exponent is 2.017 and the
Kaplan-Yorke dimension is DKY = 2.0265. The corresponding characteristic equa-
tion λ3 + Aλ2 + 1 = 0 gives eigenvalues λ = −2.24, 0.1 ± 0.66i over the range of
A for which bounded solution exist, which gives a single ﬁxed unstable saddle-focus
with an instability index of 2 at the origin.
The projection of the attractor of (10) is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the time
history of x and its ﬁrst three time-derivatives, after the trajectory has settled onto
the attractor, for A = 2.017 [12].
Similarly, the ˙x2 term in (10) can be replaced by x ˙x, which yields another function:
...x + A ¨x −x ˙x + x = 0 ,
(11)
with which the system is chaotic over the same range of A as in Eq. (10).
The projection of the attractor is illustrated in Fig. 2. Both trajectories of Eqs. (10)
and (11) contain spirals outward to the attractor from an initial condition near but
not at the unstable saddle-focus origin.
By adjusting the above two cases, other two cases with three terms and two
quadratic nonlinearities in the jerk function can be found, which are described by
...x + Ax ¨x −˙x2 + x = 0 ,
(12)
with A = 0.645, and
...x + Ax ¨x −x ˙x + x = 0 ,
(13)

jerk function (11), with
A = 2.017, on the x-v plane
[11]

278
X. Wang and G. Chen
with A = −0.113.
Concurrently, a more general form of the jerk function can be proposed, based on
Eq. (10), as follows:
...x + A ¨x ± ˙x2 + x = 0 ,
(14)
which has three terms and a single quadratic nonlinearity.
Equation 14 can also be written as
...x + A ¨x ± x ˙x + x = 0 .
(15)
Referring to Fu and Heidel [14, 15], it was already proved that no three-
dimensional, dissipative, dynamical systems with less than ﬁve terms and quadratic
nonlinearities are able to generate chaos. Their result lends credence to claim that
Eq. (14) is the simplest possible jerky system with one quadratic term that can gen-
erate chaos.
Furthermore, other types of general jerk functions were possible, as introduced
and discussed by Sprott in [11].
2.2
Newtonian Jerky Dynamics
Considering that the jerk function is related to the time derivative of the acceleration
of a particle11 with mass m, by Newton’s second law, one has
dF
dt = m J .
(16)
Assuming that the force has an explicit dependence on x, ˙x and time t, which is
F = F(˙x, x, t), and J has dependence on ¨x, one can write
M =
 t
G(x(τ))dτ .
(17)
Thus, by differentiating Newton’s second law with a force depending explicitly on
the instantaneous position, velocity and time, Sprott [11] introduced a Newtonian
jerk function as follows:
J = (a1 + a2x + a3 ˙x)¨x + (a5 + a6x + a2 ˙x)˙x + a10 ,
(18)
which produces no example, however, even if all six coefﬁcients are non-zero.
Rather than concerning the motion of physical bodies, the aforementioned Linz
and Sprott’s works have actually transformed the conventional study of jerky dynam-
ics to a new science [18].

279
2.3
Jerk Function with Cubic Nonlinearities
More interestingly, a general jerk function with only cubic nonlinearities was also
introduced by Sprott [11] as follows:
J = (b1 + b2x2 + b3 ˙x2 + b4 ¨x2 + b5x ˙x + b6x ¨x + b7 ˙x ¨x)¨x
+ (b8 + b9x2 + b10 ˙x2 + b11x ˙x)˙x + (b12 + b13x2)x ,
(19)
which contains terms higher than linear in ¨x.
Chaotic solutions of Eq. (19) were identiﬁed. Also, eight functionally distinct
forms were found with three terms and two cubic nonlinearities, and four examples
with four terms and one cubic nonlinearity were coined as well. But all of these
examples are more complicated than Eqs. (10) and (11).
Three of these jerk functions with cubic nonlinearities are
...x + ¨x3 + x2 ˙x + Ax = 0 ,
(20)
with A = 0.25,
...x + A ¨x −x ˙x2 + x3 = 0 ,
(21)
with A = 3.6, and
...x + x2 ˙x −A(1 −x2)x = 0 ,
(22)
with A = 0.01.
Moreover, a special form of the system, related to the old Moore-Spiegel oscillator
[19], which models the inviscid convection of a rotating ﬂuid, has four terms and one
nonlinearity, described by
...x + ¨x + (T −R + Rx2)˙x + T x = 0 ,
(23)
where T is analogous to the Prandtl number [20] times the Taylor number, while R
is analogous to the Prandtl number times the Rayleigh number [21, 22].
For T = 6 and R = 20, the aperiodic behavior of this system is illustrated in
Fig. 3.
Malasoma [25] searched for simple chaotic jerk functions with cubic nonlineari-
ties, and introduced a new example system
...x + A ¨x −x ˙x2 + x = 0 ,
(24)
which is invariant under the parity transformation x →−x. Equation (24) is the
simplest jerk function with cubic nonlinearities, which is chaotic when A = 2.05.
The chaotic attractor on the x-˙x plane is illustrated in Fig. 4.
When A decreases, the usual period-doubling route to chaos occurs, with a bound-
ary crisis and unbounded solutions. Therefore, the range of A to allow chaos to exist

is narrow: 2.0278· · · < A < 2.0840 · · · . For A = 2.05, the Lyapunov exponents are
(0.0541, 0, −2.1041) and the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is DKY = 2.0257.
2.4
Piecewise-Linear Jerk Functions
After conﬁrming the simplest chaotic jerk function with a quadratic nonlinearity or
a cubic nonlinearity, it is natural to ask if there are jerk functions in piecewise linear
form.
One accessible method was introduced by Sprott [26]. Let ˙x2 be replaced with |˙x|
in Eq. (14). Then, consider systems of the following form:

Chaotic Jerk Systems with Hidden Attractors
281
...x = a1 ¨x + a2ϕ(¨x) + a3 ˙x + a4ϕ(˙x) + a5x + a6ϕ(x) + a7 ,
(25)
where ϕ(x) is a simple nonlinear function and a1 −a7 are non-zero coefﬁcients
with random values. Note that the coefﬁcients can range from minus inﬁnity to
plus inﬁnity. When they are of order unity, the chaotic solutions occur in groups.
Consequently, unbounded solutions are generated when |¨x|, |˙x| and |x| never exceed
10.
One simple example is to use ϕ(x) = |˙x| as a piecewise-linear approximation to
ϕ(x) = x2, with the nonlinearity conﬁned to the point x = 0.
Based on the veriﬁcation method introduced and discussed in [6, 11, 12, 27], a
general class of piecewise-linear jerk functions is proposed by Linz and Sprott [28],
as
...x + A1 ¨x + A2 ˙x + A3|x| + A4 = 0 ,
(26)
where Ai i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are control parameters.
Note that Eq. (26) is different from the linear jerky function with the replacement
of x(t) by its modulus, but not by the addition of any nonlinearity, and it is not
reversible.
By choosing coefﬁcients A1 = A and A2 = −A3 = A4 = 1, a non-polynomial
chaotic jerk function, which is probably the most elementary piecewise-linear, is
introduced as follows:
...x = A ¨x + ˙x −|x| + 1 = 0 ,
(27)
which can also be written as
...x = A ¨x + ˙x ± x + 1 = 0 .
(28)
Thus, its exact solution can be obtained, segment by segment, for x(t) < 0 and
x(t) > 0 along with the appropriate matching conditions for x(t) = 0. Through
numerical calculation, Eq. (27) can be solved, which has two equilibria x⋆= ±1. The
correspondingeigenvaluesobtainedfromthecharacteristicequationareλ1 = −1and
λ2 = λ3 = i. According to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion [29], x⋆= +1 is unstable
for any value of A while x⋆= −1 is stable for A > 1. At A = 1, x⋆= −1 becomes
unstable via a Hopf bifurcation.
As a typical case, Fig. 5 shows a stereoscopic view of the chaotic attractor gener-
ated by Eq. (27) with A = 0.6. It resembles the attractor of the minimal polynomial
jerky dynamics, as well as the structure known from the Rössler system.
This system shows a periodic-doubling route to chaos as A is decreasing from
0.8 to 0.64085. On the other hand, there is a representative chaotic band structure
disrupted by the occurrence of periodic windows for a small value of A. Particularly,
at A ≃0.547, the periodic-three dynamics becomes unstable and the long-time evo-
lution of Eq. (27) diverges to inﬁnity.
Linz [31] proved that no chaotic dynamics exhibits in Eq. (27) if any of its terms
are set to zero. Also, the term |x| can be replaced with |xn|, |x|n, or x2n where n
is a positive integer, or more generally with any inversion of symmetric function

ﬂow in Eq. (26), with
A = 0.6 [30]
f (x) = −f (x), for all x, while this system can still have chaos. Numerical experi-
ments show that solutions f (x) = |x|n exist for any integer n > 0.
More recently, another piecewise-linear jerk function was introduced by Fischer
et al. [32], as follows:
...x + A ¨x + B ˙x + x −|x| + C = 0 ,
(29)
which is intended to model an experimental example discovered in an electronic
circuit. Chaos exhibits in Eq. (29) with B = 0.3 and A = C = 0.1. Obviously it
contains one more term and one more coefﬁcient than Eq. (27), thus not leading
to a “maximally simple” function, although the term x −|x| can be written as
2 min(x, 0).
2.5
Jerky Dynamics Accompanied with Many Driving
Functions
Actually, both Eqs. (27) and (29) can be obtained from a more general function.
Sprott [26] found an equation in the general jerk form for most of the dissipative
chaotic systems, which is
...x + A ¨x + ˙x = G(x) ,
(30)
where the driving function G(x) is a second-degree (or higher degree) polynomial,
such as x2 −b or x(x −b), in which A and b are constants. By integrating each term
of Eq. (30), it can be found that this system is a damped harmonic oscillator driven
by a nonlinear memory term, including the integral of G(x).

In other studies, chaos in numerical simulations were performed on the above
equation with a cubic form [33] or special piecewise-linear form [65, 66] of G(x),
and an RLC circuit with an unspeciﬁed nonlinear ampliﬁer [34, 35].
Coullet et al. [33] observed chaotic dynamics for the above equation with a cubic
driving term G(x) = Bx(1 −x2), with A = 0.1 and B = 0.44, as well as a special
piecewise-linear form of the driving function
G(x) =
⎧
⎨
⎩

(31)
which generates chaos with a = 0.1, b = 0.2061612, and c = 0.2171604. Equa-
tion (31) generates a homoclinic orbit that satisﬁes the Šil’nikov criterion.
Note that Eq. (30) with a nonlinear G(x) has not been well studied. Sprott [36]
listed some elementary examples in the sense of having the algebraically simplest
structure of ODE with few terms of nonlinearity. By selecting
G(x) = B|x| −C ,
these systems are speciﬁed as in Table 1, where typical values of B for arbitrary
values of C, accompanied with the largest Lyapunov exponent, are given. Besides
these examples, other accessible G(x) are possible, for example, a delta function or
a hysteretic function.
In all the cases studied here, the case of G(x) = Bx −C sgn(x) has the largest
Lyapunov exponent. By applying a variant of simulated annealing, the value of coefﬁ-
cients A = 0.55 and B = 2.84 are adjusted for maximizing the Lyapunov exponents,
yielding (1.055, 0, −1.655). The Kaplan-Yorke dimension is DKY = 2.637. From
the simulation, it is easy to see that the attractor contains a thin torus that nearly

reaches the boundary of its small basin of attraction; therefore, initial conditions
must be chosen carefully to produce bounded solutions. One appropriate initial con-
dition is (x0, y0, z0) = (0.03, −0.33, −0.3).
To determine the least nonlinear form of G(x), consider the two-part piecewise-
linear function with the smallest bend at the knee “θ” so as to obtain G(x) =
±(B|x| −C) with A = 0.025 and B = 0.468. In this case, θ = 2tan−1B, which
is equivalent to 50.2◦. In this case, the basin of attraction is very small, and the
chaotic attractor coexists with a nearby limit cycle.
Since Table 1 is not exhaustive of simple chaotic jerk functions, Sprott and Linz
[30] proposed an equation in a different form, as follows:
...x = a ¨x + bϕ(˙x) + c ˙x + dϕ(˙x) + ex + f ϕ(x) + g ,
(32)
where ϕ(x) is a nonlinear function.
In this form, a dozen of algebraically distinct cases with three terms, and several
hundred cases with four terms on the right-hand side. Some of these additional
examples are listed in Table 2.
Table 2 includes examples that are a superset of a simpler equation, as well as
those with multiple nonlinearities. However, these cases have not been carefully
veriﬁed, thus providing no values for the coefﬁcients a and b. Note that most cases
in the table are conservative with very small Lyapunov exponents, and they require
a careful choice of initial conditions to generate chaos.
More recently, Patidar and Sud [67] investigated a special jerky system by select-
ing
G(x) = B(x2 −1) ,
yielding
...x + A ¨x + ˙x = B(x2 −1) ,
(33)

Chaotic Jerk Systems with Hidden Attractors
285
which, with some appropriate values of coefﬁcients A and B, can generate chaos.
To investigate the effect of weakening the nonlinearity on the jerk dynamics of
Eq. (33), the term x2 is replaced by |x|, leading to a new jerk system:
...x + A ¨x + ˙x = B(|x| −1) .
(34)
It was found that both Eqs. (33) and (34) possess equilibria (±1, 0, 0), and they
share some common properties, such as: for A > 0, B < 0 and A > −2B, the equi-
librium (1, 0, 0) is stable, but when A = −2B this equilibrium becomes unstable
via a Hopf bifurcation, while a state limit cycle emerges. On the other hand, for
A > 0, B > 0, and A > 2B, the equilibrium (−1, 0, 0) is stable, but with A = 2B
this equilibrium becomes unstable via a Hopf bifurcation, while a stable limit cycle
emerges. Moreover, it can be veriﬁed that these jerk functions are dissipative, pos-
sessing stable chaotic attractors, for all positive values of A, but it is diverging with
no stable attractors for all negative values of A.
2.6
Multi-scroll Chaotic Jerk System
Multi-scroll attractors were well developed and documented in the literature [37–
40, 68], yet the aforementioned general jerk function that can generate multi-scroll
attractors had not been investigated until Xie et al. [41] who attempted to modify a
jerk function to generate multi-directional multi-scroll attractors.
The modiﬁed jerk system reads
⎧
⎨

˙x = y −F2(y)
˙y = z = F3(z)
˙z = a(−x −y −z + F1(x) + F2(y) + F3(z)) ,

where a ∈[0.47, 0.96] and F1(x), F2(y), F3(z) are the staircase function series,
described by
F1(x) =

By solving ˙x = ˙y = ˙z = 0, the equilibrium (xeq, yeq, zeq) can be found and the
associated Jacobian matrix is given by

An example of 3 × 3 × 3 grid-scroll attractors generated from system (35) with
ξ > 0 is shown in Fig. 6.
Subsequently, Bao et al. [42] introduced a chaotic jerk system that can generate
multi-scroll attractors. Driven by a step function series, the new system is given by
...x = −μ[¨x + ˙x + x −f (x)] ,
(36)
or, in a state-space form,

By numerical computation, the Lyapunov exponents of Eq. (36) with μ = 0.9 are
found as (0.1117, 0, −1.0129), and the Lyapunov dimension is 2.1103, for initial
condition (x0, y0, z0) = (0.8, 0.8, 0).
The projection of the 5-scroll chaotic attractor is shown in Fig. 7. It is clear from
the equation that there are (2N + 1) scroll equilibria located on the x-axis, where a
one-scroll equilibrium is corresponding to a one-scroll attractor.
More recently, several chaotic systems based on the jerk model are reported by
Liu et al. [43]. Consider the jerk system, proposed by Sprott [26, 36], in the following
form :

˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = −x −y −az + f (x)] .

Set
f (x) = sgn(x) + sgn(x + 2) + sgn(x −2) .
For a = 0.6, a four-scroll chaotic attractor is found and the equilibria are obtained
as (1, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0), (3, 0, 0), (−3, 0, 0), with f (x) = x. The phase projection
is shown in Fig. 8.
Based on the mechanism generating the four-scroll attractor, a n-scroll jerky
functional form can be deduced. By adjusting the nonlinear function in Eq. (38), the
characteristic value of the equilibria will satisfy Šil’nikov theorem with the slope kept
to one. Six more examples with either odd or even properties are listed in Table 3.

Other Examples
2.7.1
Example 1
Thomas [44] introduced a set of symmetric equations in the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −ax + f (y)
˙y = −ay + f (z)
˙z = −az + f (x) ,
which exhibits chaos with cubic polynomial f or f (x) = sin(x), where a = 0.18.
It was shown that this system is simple and particularly elegant, since its trajectory
percolates chaotically within the inﬁnite three-dimensional lattice of unstable steady
states. Therefore, it is called “Labyrinth Chaos”. However, the jerk form of this

289
system is so complicated due to the three nonlinearities, which will not be detailed
here.
On the other hand, considered the terms in the Jacobian matrix as feedback loops
and deduced candidate chaotic systems and the signs of the coefﬁcients, other two
simpler jerk systems can be formulated. One is
...x + (c −a)¨x + (1 −ac)˙x + 2x ˙x −ax2 + cx = 0 ,
(39)
where a = 0.385, c = 2, which generates chaos with several equilibria. The other is
...x + (c −a)¨x + (1 −ac)˙x + 2x ˙x + cx = 0 ,
(40)
which exhibits chaos with only one equilibrium at the origin. Note that this example
is actually a generalization of Eq. (15).
2.7.2
Example 2
The van der Pol oscillator [46] is well known, since it was the ﬁrst example to be
analyzed for chaotiﬁcation. The van der Pol oscillator is described by
¨x −ε ˙x(1 −x2) + x = 0 ,
(41)
where ε is a real parameter.
Zuppa [47] proposed a van der Pol jerk function by adding a new state variable
to it:
...x + ¨x −ε ˙x(1 −x2) + x = 0 .
(42)
By setting ε = 1, the jerk function can be written as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = −x + y −z −x2y ,
(43)
where y(t) = ˙x(t) and z(t) = ¨x.
Ding and Zhang [45] further added four innovative terms to system (43) and
change the coefﬁcients of these two terms, to obtain
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = ax + by + cz
˙y = dx + ey + f z
˙z = −x + y −z −x2y .

By solving the equation ˙x = ˙y = ˙z = 0, the equilibria of system (44) are obtained.
The Jacobian matrix for this system at the equilibria is given by
J =

For the case of a = 0.1, b = 1.5, c = −0.4, d = e = −0.5, f = 20, with initial
condition (x0, y0, z0) = (1.6, −8, 0.2), the corresponding eigenvalues are obtained:
λ1 = −5.74915,
λ2,3 = 2.12458 ± 0.874763i .
The phase portrait of this case is shown in Fig. 9. The result exhibits a homoclinic
orbit that satisﬁes the Šil’nikov theorem.
2.7.3
Example 3
Motivated by Sprott’s work, Malasoma [25] found many distinct classes of dissipa-
tive chaotic systems with ﬁve terms, including one quadratic nonlinearity and their
jerk form. By listing all possible combinations of variables in a systematic way, 75
types of nonlinear systems that are neither asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface
nor deducible to a two-dimensional autonomous system were proposed. Based on
the spectrum of the Lyapunov exponents, six types of chaotic jerky dynamics are
classiﬁed, as listed in Table 4.
The example of ...x = −ax −a ¨x + x ˙x + ˙x ¨x/x can also be reformulated as

For a = 10.285 with initial condition (x0, y0, z0) = (−22, −12, −109), the phase
portrait of the attractor is illustrated in Fig. 11. This system is not sensitive to the
iteration step size based on numerical analysis (Fig. 10).
2.7.4
Example 4
Mahnoud and Ahmed [48] introduced a complex jerk function of the following form:
...x = J(x, ¯x, ˙x, ˙¯x, ¨x, ¨¯x) ,
where x is a complex variable while ¯x is its complex conjugate variable.
An example of this form is
...x + α ¨x + β ˙x + υx + ηx2 ¯x = 0 ,
(46)
where α, β, η are positive parameters and υ is a negative constant. Equation (46)
can be written as

X. Wang and G. Chen
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = −αz −βy −υx −ηx2 ¯x ,
(47)
where x = u1 + iu2, y = u3 + iu4 and z = u5 + iu6. Therefore, Eq. (47) has a real
version in the form of
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
˙u1 = u3
˙u2 = u4
˙u3 = u5
˙u4 = u6

1 + u2
2)
˙u6 = −αu6 −βu4 −υu2 −ηu2(u2

2) ,
(48)
which is invariant.
By solving
˙
ui(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 0, the equilibrium of Eq. (47) is obtained as
E0 = (r cos θ,r sin θ, 0, 0, 0, 0).
By linearizing the system, the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium is obtained, as
J =
⎡

The corresponding characteristic equation is
(λ3 + αλ2 + βλ + υ)2 = 0 .
Thus, the real parts of the roots λ are negative. The system is stable, by the Routh-
Hurwitz criterion, if and only if
α > 0, β > 0, υ > 0, αβ −υ > 0 .
Otherwise, the equilibrium E0 is unstable with υ < 0. The chaotic attractor generated
by α = η = 1, β = 4, υ = −5 and initial conditions (t0, u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6) =
(0, 4, 1, −2, 2, −1, 1) is shown in Fig. 11.

Systematic Method for Constructing a Simple 3D Jerk
System
Since all the previously mentioned chaotic systems have either one quadratic non-
linearity or multiple nonlinearities that can be recast to the form of jerk functions,
Eichorn et al. [9] summarized the situations with three-dimensional jerk functions
and proposed a systematic method of ﬁnding such systems, based on the method
introduced by Becker and Thomas [49].
Assume a dynamical system of the following form:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = c1 + b11x + b12y + b13z + n1(x)
˙y = c2 + b21x + b22y + b23z + n2(x)
˙z = c3 + b31x + b32y + b33z + n3(x) ,
(49)
with ni, i = 1, 2, 3, being nonlinear functions that can be recast to a jerky equation
...x = J(x, ˙x, ¨x). Assume that the following condition is satisﬁed:
b12n2(x) + n13n3(x) = f (x, b12y + b13z) ,
(50)
with f being any well-deﬁned function and
b2
12b23 −b2
12b32 + b12b13(b33 −b22) ̸= 0 .
(51)
Notethatthevariables y and z areallowedtoenteronlylinearlyintothe ˙x equation,
and b13 = 0 gives an important special case of Eq. (49). Thus, the condition (51)
reduces to
b12 ̸= 0 ,
b23 ̸= 0 .

294
X. Wang and G. Chen
Clearly, in Eq. (50), the nonlinear term n2(x) is a function of x and y, and n3(x)
can be any function of x. Thus, the jerky dynamical system (49) can be rewritten as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = c1 + b11x + b12y + n1(x)
˙y = c2 + b21x + b22y + b23z + n2(x, y)
˙z = c3 + b31x + b32y + b33z + n3(x) .
(52)
By applying the above transformable dynamical systems, all the examples intro-
duced in [6], constructed based on Sprott A to S systems (see Table 1 of Chap.
‘Introduction’) or the Rössler system, can exhibit toroidal chaos (donated by TR)
and can be recast to the jerk form.
Seven examples of simple chaotic polynomial jerky dynamics were listed in
Table 5.
More recently, in ﬁnding jerk functions that can generate chaos in the form of
...x + ¨x + x = f (˙x) ,
Munmuangsaen et al. [50] applied another systematic numerical method from the
space of control parameters embedded in the nonlinear function f (˙x) with initial
conditions suitable to ﬁnd positive Lyapunov exponents. By this method, many more
jerk functions were found that can generate chaos, following the systems proposed
earlier by Sprott [6, 11, 12, 26]. The expression of such jerk functions are listed
in Table 6, and the corresponding projections of the attractors of these systems are
illustrated in Fig. 12.

Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems
By integrating each term of Eq. (30), one obtains
¨x + A ˙x + x =

g(x)dt .
(53)
It can be generalized to a higher-dimensional form, as
d(n)x
dt(n) + a d(n−1)x
dt(n−1) + d(n−2)x
dt(n−2) = g(x) .
(54)
When n > 4, the system is called a “hyperjerk system”, which is in the form of
d(n)x
dt(n) = f
d(n−1)x
dt(n−1) , d(n−2)x
dt(n−2) , ..., x

,
since it involves time derivatives of a jerk function.
Next, some examples are presented.

By modifying Eq. (30), Chlouverakis et al. [51] presented a generalized jerk function
in the following form:

Coexisting Attractors in Jerk Systems
The dynamics of simple jerk functions that generate coexistence of chaotic attractors
have not been well studied. The ﬁrst studied examples were the J D1 system: ...x =
a ¨x + ˙x2 −x, and J D2 system: ...x = a ¨x + bx + x ˙x −1, by Eichhorn et al. [56].
Both systems have chaotic behaviors in some speciﬁc parameter ranges. Based on

300

Fig. 16
2D projection of
Eq. (62) on the (x1, x2) plane
[55]
numerical simulations, the dependence of the long-time system dynamical behavior
on the system parameters were determined by evaluating their Lyapunov spectra.
For example, the dependence of initial conditions is addressed using forward and
backward bifurcation diagrams. The coexistence of two stable attractors was found,
but not more than two coexisting attractors were found from both J D1 and J D2
systems, due to the absence of their apparent symmetry.
5.1
Example 1
Inspired by the previous investigation on the coexistence of attractors in jerk systems,
Kengne et al. [57] presented a new jerk system based on the Sprott MO5 system [30]:
...x = −aγ ˙x −¨x + ax −ax3 ,
(63)
which is invariant under the transformation
(x1, x2, x3) = (−x1, −x2, −x3) .
Based on numerical simulations, there are three equilibria of Eq. (63): E0 =
(0, 0, 0) and E1,2 = (±1, 0, 0). Since these equilibria share the same stability, the
Jacobian matrix
J =

gives the corresponding characteristic equation:

(65)
thus, the eigenvalues can be found.
Notice that E0(0, 0, 0) is always unstable, while the stability of E1,2 depends on
the two control parameters a and γ . Accordingly, E1,2 are stable only for γ > 2.
For γ = 0.7250, a = 18, with initial conditions (0, ±5, ±5), up to four different
attractors can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 17.
5.2
Example 2
Njitacke et al. [58] also presented another jerk system in the form of a fourth-order
smooth differential equation:
⎧

˙x1 = x2
˙x2 = ax3
˙x3 = x1 −x3 −γ x2 −βexp(−ρx4)sinh(ρ1x1)
˙x4 = ε(β(exp(−ρx4)cosh(ρ1x1) −1) −ηx4) ,
(66)
where the over dot represents differentiation with respect to the dimensionless time
τ. Note that all the state variables of Eq. (66) are real and are determined in real
experiments with a standard oscilloscope. The system is invariant.
By setting all the terms on the right-hand side be zero, the equilibria of Eq. (66)
can be obtained: E0(0, 0, 0) is trivial, while the non-trivial symmetric equilibria E1,2
are deﬁned by the three control parameters β, η and ρ.
By linearizing system (66) at any equilibrium, the Jacobian matrix is obtained, as

For
a = 5, γ = 2.2, ε = 0.002, η = 100, β = 5.36 × 10−5, ρ = 10.121,
eigenvalues at E0(0, 0, 0, 0) are λ1 = −0.2, λ2,3 = −0.7152 ± 3.3323i, λ4 =
0.4304, while eigenvalues at E1,2 are λ1,2 = 1.0734 ± 4.0747i, λ3 = −3.1469,
λ4 = −0.273. Numerically, for values of a within the range 8.952 ≤a ≤9.4, the
long-term dynamical behavior of Eq. (66) depends on the initial states. Therefore,
there occurs an interesting phenomenon of coexisting multiple attractors. Figure 18
shows the basin of attraction of the four coexisting attractors.
5.3
Example 3
Tamba et al. [59] added a parameter a to the van der Pol–Dufﬁng jerk oscillator
and presented a new system that can exhibit coexisting chaotic attractors. This jerk
system is described by

⎩
˙x = y
˙y = az
˙z = −z + ε(1 −x2)y −x + βx3 ,
(68)
which is dissipative and invariant.
Based on numerical analysis, the three equilibria are found to be E0(0, 0, 0) and
E1,2(±1/√β, 0, 0). The corresponding characteristic equation is
λ3 + λ2 −aε[1 −(x∗)2]λ + a[1 + 2ε(x∗)(y∗) −3β(x∗)2] = 0 .
According to the Routh-Hurwith criteria, E0 is stable if and only if a > 0 and
ε < −1, and E1,2 are stable if and only if a > 0 and ε(1 −1/β) < 2.

Cross section of the
basin of attraction of Eq. (68)
on the x-z-plane, with
β = 0.125, ε = 1.0 and
a = 8.1. Initial conditions in
the black regions generate
unbounded orbits; those in
the light blue region lead to
periodic attractors; those in
the red region lead to chaotic
attractors [59]
When β = 0.125, Eq. (68) has a pair of period-1 attractors and chaotic attractors.
As can be seen from Fig. 19, the possibility of having a chaotic attractor is much
greater than the ones to have periodic attractors.

Chaotic Jerk Systems with Hidden Attractors
6.1
Example 1
Motivated by [60, 61], Wang et al. [62] proposed a new quadratic jerk system with
hidden attractors, as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = −ax −by −cz + y2 + bxy ,
(69)
where a, b, c are real parameters with a ̸= 0.
Set ˙x = ˙y = ˙z = 0. Them=n, it can be found that the origin E0(0, 0, 0) is the only
equilibrium of Eq. (69). The Jacobian matrix at the origin is
J =
⎡
⎢⎢⎣
0
1
0
0
0
1
−a −b −c
⎤
⎥⎥⎦,
(70)
and the characteristic equation is
λ3 + cλ2 + bλ + a = 0 .
(71)
Based on the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, there are three roots with negative real
parts for the case of a > 0, c > 0, bc −a > 0. Thus, system (73) has a stable node
or two stable node-foci for a > 0, c > 0, bc −a > 0. Besides, the system has two

Eq. (69) in the 3D space [62]
saddle-foci for a > 0, c > 0, bc −a < 0. For a = 3.4, the Lyapunov exponents
are (0.062, 0, −4.059) and the chaotic attractor is shown in Fig. 20.
6.2
Example 2
Modifying the Sprott R system, the ﬁrst piecewise-linear jerk system with hidden
attractor was introduced by Li et al. [63].
Interestingly, the circuit implementation of this system shows smooth orbits sub-
ject to the inherent electronic noise, even without using any equipment to set the
initial conditions.
With the discontinuous signum function, this new jerk system is given by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = −a sgn(x) −y sgn(x) −z + b .
(72)
Note that for a = 2.65, b = 0.4, Eq. (72) restores chaotic solutions while for
a = 1.325, b = 0.2, the system generates chaotic oscillations. The corresponding
Lyapunov exponents are (0.016, 0, −1.016) and the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is
2.016.
Figure 21 shows the basin of attraction for the hidden attractor. Analytically, the
coexistence of a constant and a signum function makes the equilibria disappear.
Therefore, the corresponding chaotic attractor should be hidden, which cannot be
found by choosing initial conditions according to any equilibria.

Example 3
Wang and Lin [64] found another chaotic jerk system with hidden attractors, which
reads
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = −ax −by −cz + ez2 −f xy −gxz −hyz .
(73)
Numerical analysis gives the only equilibrium of Eq. (73): E0(0, 0, 0). The char-
acteristic equation is λ3 + cλ2 + bλ + a = 0.
Therearethreerootswithnegativerealpartsfora > 0, c > 0, bc −a > 0.Thus,
according to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, system (73) has a stable node or two stable
node-foci for a > 0, c > 0, bc −a > 0, and the system has two saddle-foci for
a > 0, c > 0, bc −a < 0.
Fora = c = 1, b = 1.08, e = −1, f = −0.4, g = h = 0, the Lyapunov expo-
nents are (0.03, 0, −1.03) and the chaotic attractor is shown in Fig. 22.

Multi-Stability in Symmetric Systems

Introduction
The structure of a dynamical
system is the key factor for investigating its multi-
stability. Generally, a system can be divided into two categories; that is, a symmetric
one and an asymmetric one. A dynamical system ˙X = F(X) = ( f1(X), f2(X), ...,
fN(X)) (X = (x1, x2, ..., xN)T ) is symmetric if there exists a variable substitution:
u1 = −x1, u2 = −x2, ..., uk = −xk, ui = xi, (here k, i ∈Z+, i ∈k + 1, k + 2, ...,
N) satisﬁes ˙U = F(U)(U = (u1, u2, ..., uN)). Speciﬁcally, for a three-dimensional
dynamical system, ˙X = F(X) (X = (x1, x2, x3)T ): If xi = −ui (i ∈1, 2, 3) is
subject to the same governing equation, the system is reﬂection symmetric; if
xi = −ui, x j = −u j, xk = uk (i, j ∈{1, 2, 3}, i ̸= j, k ∈{1, 2, 3}\{i, j}) is sub-
ject to the same governing equation, the system is rotationally symmetric; if
x1 = −u1, x2 = −u2, x3 = −u3 is subject to the same governing equation, the
system is inversion symmetric.
For symmetric systems, it is common to ﬁnd multiple coexisting attractors [1–10],
because a pair of attractors will appear when the symmetry is broken [9, 10]. Even
more speciﬁcally, a symmetric pair of attractors may coexist with another regime
of symmetric attractors. When the dimension of a dynamical system increases, the
coexistence becomes more complicated, and other coexisting attractors may show
up. Symmetric bifurcations describe the dynamical evolvement in the symmetric
systems and also imply a new phenomenon of attractor merging. In Fig. 1, a variety
of coexistence of symmetric attractors are illustrated.

Broken Butterﬂy
One way to show the phenomenon of broken butterﬂy is to ﬁnd the multi-stability in
the classic Lorenz system [11], which is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = σ(y −x),
˙y = rx −xz −y,
˙z = xy −bz.
(1)
The Lorenz system includes seven terms, ﬁve of which are linear, and two are
quadratic nonlinearities. Because the variables x, y, z, and time t can be linearly
rescaled, four of the seven coefﬁcients can be set to ±1, leaving exactly three param-
eters to completely determine the dynamics of the system. The selected parameters
(σ,r, b) were originally chosen to characterize the atmospheric convection. When
σ = 10, r = 28, b = 8/3, there is a single symmetric double-wing chaotic attractor
that resembles a butterﬂy. Interestingly, this chaotic solution is globally attracting,
and the attractor is robust to relatively large variations of the parameter values.
Almost all studies assumed that these three parameters are positive, due to the
fact that the system has attractors only if σ + b + 1 > 0, and it is globally attracting
only if σ > 0 and b > 0, so that all three dynamic variables are damped [12].
Normally,apositiver isrequiredtoprovidetheenergyformaintainingoscillations
from damping by corresponding positive feedback. However, negative values of the
parameters can still lead to periodic and chaotic solutions. Although, in most cases,
there are unbounded regions that refute globally attracting. For negative b, the anti-
damping in the ˙Z equation can provide the necessary energy. Since chaos can survive
for negative b regardless of positive or negative r, we focus on the case with r = 0
because it has features common to the two regimes and it reduces the parameter
space to two dimensions, allowing it to be completely explored.
When r is zero, the Lorenz system remains the rotational symmetry about the z-
axis, correspondingly three real equilibrium points, i.e., P1 = (0, 0, 0), P2 = (√−b,
√−b, −1), and P3 = (−√−b, −√−b, −1) are also symmetric with respect to the
z-axis, if the parameter b is negative. The dynamical regions in σb space, when r is

zero, show us an overall perspective of the properties, where each pixel is calculated
for a random initial condition taken from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero
and unit variance, and therefore the dotted regions are candidates for coexisting
attractors. As shown in Fig. 2, the majority of solutions are unbounded, except some
separate areas of periodic and chaotic solutions. The narrow area in the vicinity of
the line b = 2.17σ −0.866 has bounded solutions. While the green part at small
σ and the red area at small b are numerical artifacts that come about because the
orbit remains for long times near the equilibrium point P1 at the origin. Although
the parameter region giving a chaotic solution is very tiny, we found many regimes
of multi-stability.
For example, when r = 0, σ = 0.192, b = 0.45, a symmetric pair of strange
attractors coexist, as shown in Fig. 2a, with basins of attraction shown in Fig. 3b
[13]. The basins of attraction for the two strange attractors are indicated by pink and
light blue, respectively. The basins have the expected symmetry about the z-axis and
an intricate fractal structure. Most initial conditions, as expected, lead to unbounded
orbits as indicated in white. Moreover, let r = 0, b = 0.30, some other patterns of
coexistence can be observed, including a typical symmetric pair of strange attractors,
a pair of nearly touching strange attractors or limit cycles, a symmetric limit cycle
with a symmetric pair of limit cycle, and even strikingly a symmetric strange attractor
with a symmetric pair of limit cycles, as shown in Fig. 4a. The basins of attraction
of the three coexisting attractors are of the fractal structure shown in Fig. 4b [13].

Symmetric Bifurcations
The Lorenz system can obtain its linearization and be further reduced to Ref. [14]
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y −x,
˙y = −z sgn(x),
˙z = x sgn(y) −b ,
(2)
which is exactly a piecewise linearized version of the quadratic diffusionless Lorenz
system [15, 16]
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y −x,
˙y = −zx,
˙z = xy −R.
(3)
System (2) has two saddle-focus equilibria at (b, b, 0) and (−b, −b, 0), with
eigenvalues (−1.4656, 0.2328 ± 0.7926i), and thus it satisﬁes the Šil’nikov condi-
tion for the existence of chaos [17, 18].

Multi-Stability in Symmetric Systems
315
Note that the parameter b in system (2) is the only term not of ﬁrst order, and
hence it is an amplitude parameter and can be set to unity without loss of generality,
unlike the case of system (3), where R is a bifurcation parameter.
Since system (2) has ﬁve terms, four of which can be scaled to ±1 by a linear
rescaling of the variables x, y, z, and time variable t, it should have one bifurcation
parameter, just like system (3). In fact, a linear transformation of system (3) with
x →
√
Rx, y →
√
Ry, z →Rz, t →t moves the parameter R from the ˙z equation
to the ˙y equation whose linearized form is then
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y −x,
˙y = −Rz sgn(x),
˙z = x sgn(y) −1 .
(4)
The amplitude parameter b can be inserted back into system (4) if desired, but
there is no loss of generality to take b = 1. Now, the bifurcation parameter R can
be used to illustrate bifurcation and ﬁnd multi-stability as shown in Fig. 5. Note
that the bifurcation diagram shows the same evolvement of dynamical behavior
under a uniﬁed Lyapunov exponent spectrum, indicating the symmetric bifurcation
in system (4). In this ﬁgure, the plot labeled Xm shows the local maxima of x in
red and the negative of the local minima of x in green. Since the equations are
symmetric under the transformation (x, y) →(−x, −y), any attractor must either
share that symmetry or have a symmetric pair of them. In the former case, the two
colors are intermingled, and in the latter case, they are separated. Four coexisting
attractors show up as predicted in the bifurcation diagram, as shown in Fig. 6. Since
the ordinary differential equation solver ode23s is applicable for the stiff problem,
here we take this solver replacing regular ode45.
The two equilibrium points have eigenvalues that satisfy λ3 + λ2 + R = 0 and
hence are unstable for all values of R. For R = 7, there is a symmetric pair of
limit cycles that undergo period-doubling as R decreases, forming a pair of strange
attractors that merge into a single symmetric attractor at approximately R = 5.81
that persists with periodic windows down to approximately R = 0.63. The behavior
at small R is similar, except that there is a presumably fractal succession of ever
smaller pairs of limit cycles that period-double into a pair of strange attractors that
merge into ever smaller symmetric strange attractors. Typical coexisting attractors
are shown in Fig. 6. Similar behavior has been observed in system (3) [10]. There is
no evidence for hysteresis or the coexistence of attractors other than the symmetric
pair shown in red and green in Fig. 6.

Coexisting Symmetric and Symmetric Pairs of Attractors
Three coexisting attractors are observed in the above classic Lorenz system. Consid-
ering that more different nonlinearities may bring out more unexpected coexistences,
here we introduce a new three-dimensional system with four quadratic terms [9]:

rium point P1 is stable provided f (a, b) = (a2 −b)2 + ab + a2b < 0, which can be
seen in the characteristic equation λ3 + ((a2 −b)/a)λ2 + ((b2 + ab −a2b)/a2)λ +
((b2 + ab)/a) = 0. Virtually, the equilibrium P1 is always unstable when the param-
eters a and b are positive. Equilibrium points P2 and P3 are symmetric with respect
to the z-axis, and their stability depends on the location of parameters a and b.
The dynamical regions are shown in Fig. 7, and the typical chaotic oscilla-
tion is shown in Fig.8, where a = 0.6, b = 3. The attractor exhibits four small
butterﬂy wings embedded in an outer double-wing. The Lyapunov exponents are
(0.1528, 0, −0.7828), and the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is DKY = 2.1952. The dot-
ted regions of red and black suggest a strange attractor coexisting with a symmetric
pair of stable equilibrium points, but further inspection ﬁnds that the chaos is transient
and the ﬂow eventually attracts to one of the stable equilibria. The dotted regions
of red, blue, and black represent coexisting point attractors, limit cycles and strange
attractors, another example of which has been reported with three such attractors [8],
whereas the present case has ﬁve coexisting attractors of three types. As reported in
Ref.[9], system (5) has eight regimes of multi-stability, including a symmetric pair
of point attractors, two-point attractors with a symmetric limit cycle, a symmetric
pair of limit cycles, two-point attractors with a symmetric pair of limit cycles, two-
point attractors with a symmetric limit cycle, two-point attractors with a symmetric
limit cycle, two-point attractors with a limit cycle and a symmetric pair of strange
attractors, and two-point attractors with a limit cycle and a symmetric pair of limit
cycles.
As we mentioned above, the basins of attraction show the initial conditions that
lead to the respective coexisting attractors. As indicated in Fig. 7, for a = 0.9 and
b = 4, the system (5) has a symmetric pair of point attractors coexisting with a

attractors, as shown in Fig. 9b, a symmetric limit cycle coexists with a symmetric
pair of point attractors and a symmetric pair of strange attractors, and whose basins
of attraction are shown in Fig. 10b. Here, two coexisting strange attractors are linked
together, correspondingly the basins for these two attractors involve in a complex
nested structure. The basins for point attractors are separated clearly, and the other
initial conditions lead to a symmetric limit cycle like water around an island ﬁlling
all the rest space of the basins. It is also very interesting that there is not any part of
the basins leading to an unbounded solution.

Coexisting Chaos and Torus
We can also ﬁnd multi-stability in four-dimensional systems, where the structure of
symmetry can also turn to be broken and bursts out a symmetric pair of coexist-
ing attractors. Basically, the dynamical system of higher-dimension generates more
diversiﬁcations of multi-stability since it may degenerate to becoming lower dimen-
sional under some certain circumstances. It is reasonable to expect more interesting
multi-stability in higher-dimensional systems; here, we just look into some four-
dimensional systems to give an observation of the existence of multi-stability.
We examine a simple 4D system derived from the diffusionless Lorenz system

The system (6) is dissipative with solutions as time goes to inﬁnity that contract
onto an attractor of zero measure in the 4D state space, since the rate of hypervol-
ume contraction is −1. System (6) has no equilibrium points, and also has rotational
symmetry with respect to the z-axis as evidenced by its invariance under the coor-
dinate transformation(x, y, z, u) →(−x, −y, z, −u). Linearly rescaling system (6)
according to x →√ax, y →√ay, z →az, and u →√au, two dimensions revise
to be ˙y = −axz + u, ˙z = xy −1, and we see that the system (6) separates into a
2D linear oscillator (y −u) and a 2D parametrically forced linear response system
(x −z) in the limit a →0. This time, there is no attractor, since the amplitude of the
oscillation is determined by the initial conditions. The parameter b is the square of the
oscillation frequency, and a is a measure of the coupling of the response system back
to the oscillator, as well as the nonlinearity that gives rise to a second often chaotic
oscillation. These two oscillations give rise to the quasi-periodicity that occurs over
much of the parameter space as well as Arnold tongues [19], where the two systems
mode-lock. The abundant dynamical behavior identiﬁed by the Lyapunov exponents
is shown in Fig. 11 [20].

Four dynamical behaviors are shown with red, black, cyan, and yellow, depending
on the parameters a and b. When a = 2 and b = 0.1, system (6) is hyperchaotic with
Lyapunov exponents (0.2077, 0.0071, 0, −1.2148), and the Kaplan-Yorke dimen-
sion DKY = 3.1768, whose phase trajectory is shown in Fig. 12. We can also see
that the limit cycle is the dominant solution. Different limit cycles exist both at large
a and in a window between the torus and the chaotic region dominated by Arnold
tongues, as well as in windows amidst the chaos and in the region with coexisting
attractors. Besides limit cycles, system (6) has quasi-periodicity, chaos, and hyper-
chaos; its behavior can be controlled by the parameters and initial conditions to
make sure it stays in a speciﬁc preferred oscillation. Obviously, the dotted dynami-
cal regions give us some information on multi-stability of different types. There are
some regions for multi-stability with three attractors, where a limit cycle coexists
with two strange attractors, and speciﬁcally a torus coexists with two limit cycles or
with two strange attractors, as shown in Fig. 13.
However, despite the dots within the red/black region, it does not appear that
there are regions in which hyperchaos coexist with chaos or other solutions. Rather,
the boundary between chaos and hyperchaos is a fuzzy one where it is difﬁcult to
determine numerically with conﬁdence, which of the two small Lyapunov exponents
is actually zero. The basins of attraction of the different attracting sets are shown in
Fig. 11. Note that the basins, in this case, are four-dimensional regions and have to
be plotted in a two-dimensional cross-section. The basins in the y = 0, u = 0 plane
for a = 2, b = 0.8, where a torus coexists with a symmetric pair of limit cycles, are
shown in Fig. 11a. The basins of the two limit cycles are indicated by red and green,
respectively, and the basin of the torus is shown in cyan. The basins have the expected
symmetry about the z-axis and an intricate fractal boundary [20]. The basins in the
y = 0, u = 0 plane for a = 6, b = 0.1, where a torus coexists with a symmetric
pair of chaotic attractors are shown in Fig. 14b. The basins resemble those in Fig.
14a with symmetry and intricate fractal boundaries.

Fig. 15 Regions of various
dynamical behaviors as a
function of the bifurcation
parameters a and b
The system has the only real line of equilibria (x, 0, 0, 0) if the parameters a, b, c
are not zero, and the corresponding eigenvalues are (0, 0, 0, 0), which indicates that
the system structure happens to stay on the bifurcation parameter point whose stabil-
ity depends on the parameter and variable space of nonlinear terms. In the parameter
space, where a, b, c ̸= 0 and z ̸= 0, the system 7 always has a full rank because
the determinant of Jacobian matrix is 2abcz2, representing that the system (7) is a
real 4D system. The rate of hypervolume contraction is −(2b + 1)z, which shows
that system (7) is dissipative with solutions as time goes to inﬁnity that contract
onto an attractor of zero measure in 4D state space when the time average of z
is positive and b > −0.5. System (7) also has rotational symmetry with respect to
the z-axis as evidenced by its invariance under the same coordinate transformation
(x, y, z, u) →(−x, −y, z, −u). System (7) has eight terms, and thus three parame-
ters. Selecting c = 0.05, various dynamical bifurcations can be observed in the ﬁgure
of the dynamical region, as shown in Fig. 15, where the hyperchaotic regions are
shown in red, the chaotic regions are shown in black, the quasiperiodic regions are
shown in yellow, and the periodic regions are shown in cyan.
When a = 5, b = 0.28, c = 0.05, the system (7) is signiﬁcantly hyperchaotic
because it has four distinct Lyapunov exponents, two of which are positive. As a
matter of fact, the degree of hyperchaos can be quantiﬁed by the value of the second
Lyapunov exponent normalized to the most negative exponent. By this criterion, the
maximum hyperchaos is obtained exactly with these parameters where the Lyapunov
exponents are (0.0750, 0.0366, 0, −1.6617), and correspondingly the Kaplan-Yorke
dimension is DKY = 3.0672. The hyperchaotic attractor in different projection is
shown in Fig. 16.

There is a distinct upward thick black line with an embedded red column in the

parts. The left area in cyan indicates the state of a symmetrical limit cycle, from
which the symmetrical solution evolves to hyperchaos through chaos. Interestingly,
the right part in cyan corresponds to a mixture of limit cycles. This system (7)
has a typical dynamical behavior for the rotational symmetrical ﬂow, where chaotic
and hyperchaotic regions are surrounded by periodic region and hence the chaotic
attractors usually can come from asymmetrical limit cycles. Then two asymmetrical
coexisting strange attractors linked together, and merge somewhere, until eventually
the system becomes hyperchaos. For example, set b = 0.28, c = 0.05, as a increases,
a symmetric limit cycle splits at a ≈1.08 into a symmetric pair of limit cycles that
evolve into a symmetric pair of strange attractors that merge into a single symmetric
strange attractor, which then unmerges before remerging and becoming hyperchaotic
at about a = 3.4, as shown in Fig. 17.

Other Regimes of Coexisting Symmetric Attractors
All the above-mentioned chaotic systems are of rotational symmetry; moreover,
many other regimes of symmetric structures still give coexisting attractors with their
speciﬁc geometric characteristics. Inversion invariant systems are those which are
invariant with respect to changes in all three-dimensional space. The system differ-
ential equation in this case only contains terms of odd powers of the variables. Since
linear terms cannot exhibit chaos, those relatively simple examples of such systems
are those that contain linear and cubic terms. One of the oldest such systems is the
Moore-Spiegel [23] system but the system appears not to have coexisting attractors
for any choice of the parameters. A variant system studied by Coullet et al. [24]
admits coexisting attractors, limit cycles or chaotic solutions, as shown in Fig. 18.
The equation is

The above system exhibits coexisting chaos when a = 0.3. We can obtain the
three equilibria, one at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the others at (±1, 1, 0). The equi-
librium point at the origin is unstable while the other two are stable if a > 2. As
the parameter a decreases, a supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs at a = 2 [10], at
which point a symmetric pair of stable limit cycles are born. With the decrease of
a, the symmetric pair of limit cycles undergo separate successive period-doublings,
resulting in a symmetric pair of strange attractors at about a = 0.7263 that nearly
touch one, another named as attractor kissing, on either side of the x = 0 plane as
shown in Fig. 19.

Conclusions
Thesymmetricsystemhasbeenconsideredastheﬁrstly-selectedonetoprovidecoex-
isting solutions. For the reason that the symmetry is prone to be broken and after
that, the system exhibits a symmetric pair of attractors. More distinctively, under
some circumstances, symmetric pairs of coexisting attractors may merge together to
be a single symmetric one, or even further stand with other symmetric attractors. As
results, symmetric strange attractor, limit cycle, and quasi-periodic torus coexisting
with another symmetric pair of point attractors or limit cycles were demonstrated.
Coexisting symmetric bifurcations associated with those coexisting attractors show
us a clear description of the evolvement of dynamical behavior. Multi-stability is
checked in the 3D chaotic Lorenz system or Lorenz-like system and the 4D hyper-
chaotic Lorenz-like system for demonstrating the coexisting dynamical evolvement.

Introduction
Symmetric pairs of attractors are usually found in symmetric systems. However, it
does not mean that all the coexisting behavior comes from symmetric structures.
Compared with symmetric structure, asymmetric topology seems more common.
Typically, for a dynamical system ˙X = F(X) = ( f1(X), f2(X), · · · , fN(X)) (X =
(x1, x2, · · · , xN)T ), it is not easy to ﬁnd a variable substitution: u1 = −x1, u2 =
−x2, ..., uk = −xk, ui = xi (here, k, i ∈Z+, i ∈{k + 1, k + 2, ..., N}) satisfying
˙U = F(U) (U = (u1, u2, ..., uN)). More generally, any polarity reverse of the vari-
ables will destroy the polarity balance and the system solution appears in an asym-
metric face.
It has been shown that the stability of an asymmetric system presents a greater
variety of dynamics, and the hidden mechanism needs greater effort to disclose.
The multi-stability in asymmetric systems has not been explored as frequently as in
symmetric systems. Nevertheless, much effort has been made in ﬁnding that both
systems seem to have coexisting attractors. Here, in this chapter, we show some
examples of multi-stability in asymmetric systems. As shown in Fig.1, an example
with coexisting attractors is given by the Rössler system, where its mechanism was
analyzed. Furthermore, dimension expanding and polarity balance breaking from
symmetric structure to exhibit multi-stability is demonstrated for showing the coex-
isting attractors. Speciﬁc bifurcations are given simultaneously. Asymmetric system
is transformed back to the symmetric structure, returning those symmetric pairs of
attractors.

index-1, respectively.
The stability property of the system is changing, associated with the equilib-
ria. When a = 0.29, b = 0.14, c = 4.52, those two equilibrium points are E1 =
(0.0090, −0.0310, 0.0310) and E2 ≈(4.5110, −15.5552, 15.5552), which are a
saddle focus with index-2 and a spiral repellor with index-3, indicated by their respec-
tive eigenvalues (0.1417 ± 0.9896i, −4.5044) and (0.2720, 0.0045 ± 4.0682i). In
this case, system (1) has two coexisting strange attractors [3], as shown in Fig. 2.
It appears that the equilibrium point E1 lies on the boundary between two strange
attractors, presumably with its unstable manifold tangent to the boundary. Initial con-

Red and green attractors correspond to initial conditions IC1 = (−1.25, −0.72, −0.10) and IC2 =
(0.72, 1.28, 0.21), respectively. The two equilibrium points are shown as blue dots
ditions in the immediate vicinity of the equilibrium are about equally likely to end up
on either attractor. Thus, the attractors are self-excited but could easily be missed if
no other measurements are taken into consideration, since these two attractors look
similar in almost the same shape. The other equilibrium point E2 lies on the basin
boundary of one of the strange attractors, with some initial conditions in its vicinity
going to the attractor, with others going to inﬁnity.
When a = 0.2927, b = 0.1382, c = 4.4846, the two equilibrium points changes,
but with the similar stability listed in Table1, and system (1) exhibits coexisting chaos
and limit cycle, as shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, when a = 0.2536, b = 0.1643, c =
4.9979, both coexisting attractors turn to be limit cycles, as shown in Fig. 4.

Introducing Additional Feedback for Breaking the
Symmetry
It seems that symmetric system is more convenient to ﬁnd coexisting symmetric pair
of coexisting attractors. We guess that some minor feedback may break the symmetry
but not disperse the coexisting attractors promptly. Further checking proves that
additional feedback does deprive the symmetric structure of the system but leave
coexisting asymmetric attractors.

Almost inﬁnitely many attractors show up as shown in Fig.9, which is called as
extreme multi-stability [9–11]. The reason being hidden is that the new dimension
modiﬁes the bifurcation parameter, and thus the initial condition changes the system
solution. Further proof for this phenomenon is identiﬁed in the diagrams of Lyapunov
exponent spectrum and bifurcation, as shown in Fig.10. Different initial conditions

A Bridge Between Symmetry and Asymmetry
Since the symmetric structure of a dynamical system is associated with the multi-
stability when the symmetry is broken, it is natural to design multi-stability from
symmetry construction. Any asymmetric system can be transformed to a symmetric
one when the polarity of some of the variables is modiﬁed to accept the polarity
balance.Ourexplorationisbasedonthefactthatmanydynamicalsystemscansurvive
chaos even after some new terms are introduced, which will revise the structure
leading to different symmetry. Here, we try to revise the asymmetric Rössler system

[12] to be symmetric for multi-stability, and we observe the evolvement of the basins
of attraction leading to multiple states.
The classic Rössler system (1) has seven terms, including one constant, one
quadratic term, and correspondingly three parameters. Some other versions are pre-
sented in Table1. The classic Rössler system is of asymmetric structure, and it can
be altered by revising either the linear or the nonlinear terms to be symmetric [12].
To construct a rotational invariant system corresponding to a 180o rotation about
the z-axis, consider the system that is invariant under the transformation (x, y, z) →
(−x, −y, z). Similarly, for constructing a reﬂection invariant system corresponding
to symmetry about the z = 0 plane, the invariance under the transformation (x, y, z)
→(x, y, −z) should be preserved. While for constructing an inversion invariant
system corresponding to symmetry about the origin, the invariance under the trans-
formation (x, y, z) →(−x, −y, −z) should be obtained. Thus, we multiply some of
the terms in system (1) by appropriate choices of the variables and the symmetric
candidates are obtained, as shown in Table1, and the strange attractors are shown
in Fig. 11. The symmetric version of dynamical systems gives birth to bistability
as expected, as shown in Fig.11c. Symmetric pairs of coexisting attractors exist as
predicted at some speciﬁc parameter and are also found in those cases of rotational
symmetry and central symmetry, as shown in Fig.12, whose basins of attraction are
given in Fig.13.

Compared with the original system (5), the symmetric system (6) has symmetric

equilibrium points: one at the origin (0, 0, 0, 0) with eigenvalues (0, 0.05, 0.125 ±
0.9922i), which is an unstable node; and two other equilibrium points at (±5.4083,

with

(−5.3090, 0.1019, 0.0494

isting attractors are self-excited rather than hidden [14–20].

Conclusion
Coexisting attractors may be found easily in symmetric or asymmetric systems. In
this chapter, by giving such examples, different regimes of attractor coexistence are
demonstrated. Typically two attractors coexist in similar shapes. Additional dimen-
sion sometimes indicates extreme multi-stability for the entanglement of parameter
and system variable. Different feedback or polarity balance may transform an asym-
metric system to be a symmetric one and thus produce symmetric pairs of attractors.
All those coexisting attractors governed by a differential equation seem to have cer-
tain similarity in the phase structure.

Introduction
Some of the coexisting attractors in symmetric or asymmetric systems share the geo-
metricstructureevenwithuniﬁedLyapunovexponents[1–10].Insymmetricsystems,
many of the coexisting attractors stand in separate subspace respecting to some of
the coordinate-axis [1–7]. Coexisting attractors may be embedded in each other in
asymmetric systems [8–10]. Dynamical systems may exhibit coexisting attractors
with other relative positions, speciﬁcally some of which in phase space may have
some property of symmetry according to a super-plane but need extra offset boost-
ing. The symmetry mentioned above is obtained from a necessary transformation
and therefore, is deﬁned as conditional symmetry. As shown in Fig.1, an asymmetric
system can be revised to be symmetric one by polarity revise in the feedback term
while conditional symmetric system needs a function-based polarity balance.
Any transformation in a dynamical system should obey the basic law of polarity
balance to maintain its basic dynamical properties. A symmetric system keeps its
polarity balance even when some of the variables get polarity reversed. More gen-
erally, the polarity imbalance in a dynamical system can be induced by the polarity
reversal of any of the variables, or from the function in the feedback, or even from
the time dimension. Polarity reverse from some of the variables can retain its polarity
balance in a symmetric system while an asymmetric one loses its balance of polarity.
It shows that the polarity balance can be restored in some speciﬁc asymmetric sys-
tems when some of the variables are offset boosted in the feedback function where
the offset boosting does not change the polarity of the left-hand side of the differ-

discuss the conception of conditional symmetry and the approach for constructing
a conditional symmetric system with newly found examples. Here, the fundamental
factor is polarity control. This control sometimes is combined with other control like
frequency control, amplitude control making the attractor(s) with different geometric
and distribution characteristics.

Conception of Conditional Symmetry
Offset boosting is the key factor for understanding conditional symmetry since it
does not bring any change with derivative operation but can bring a negative sign in a
nonmonotonic function. For a dynamical system ˙X = F(X) (X = (x1, x2, ..., xN)),
a variable substitution of x j →x j + d j (here, 1 ⩽j ⩽N,i ∈{1, 2, ..., N} \ { j}
makes the variable x j in system ˙X = F(X) exhibit offset boosting, which means
that the average of the variable x j is boosted by the new introduced constant d j.
Speciﬁcally, if the above substitution only introduces a separate constant d j in one
dimensionontheright-handsideoftheequations,thenthesystemcanberegardedasa
offset-boostable system [11]. In electrical circuit, the variable x j represents a circuit
signal, and the newly introduced constant d j is a direct current source. Similarly, a
dynamical system ˙X = F(X) = ( f1(X), f2(X), ..., fN(X)) (X = (x1, x2, ..., xN))
can be deﬁned as an N-D offset-boostable system [11–14] if there exist n vari-
able substitutions recover its governing equation, except for n additional constants

allowing offsets with those variables. As reported in Ref.[14], the nonmonotonic
function like an absolute value function or a trigonometric function may result in a
polarity reversal, which can be applied to reconstruct polarity balance for conditional
symmetry.
For a differential equation
˙X = F(X) = ( f1(X), f2(X), ..., fN(X)) (X =
(x1, x2, ... , xN)), if there exists a variable substitution including polarity rever-
sal and offset boosting like ui1 = −xi1, ui2 = −xi2, ..., uik = −xik, u j1 = −x j1 +
d j1, u j2 = −x j2 + d j2, ..., u jl = −x jl + d jl, ui = xi (here, 1 ⩽i1, ..., ik ⩽N, 1 ⩽
j1, ..., jl ⩽N, i1, ..., ikand j1, ..., jl are not identical, i ∈{1, 2, ..., N} \ {i1, ...,
ik, j1, ..., jl}), the derived equation retains its balance of polarity on the two sides
of the equation and satisﬁes ˙U = F(U) (U = (u1, u2, ..., uN)). The correspond-
ing system ˙X = F(X) (X = (x1, x2, ..., xN)) is deﬁned as one of l-dimensionally
conditional symmetry, since the polarity balance needs l-dimensional offset boost-
ing [12, 13]. Speciﬁcally, for a three-dimensional dynamical system, ˙X = F(X)
(X = (x1, x2, x3)), there exist only conditional rotational symmetry in 1-dimension
and conditional reﬂection symmetry in 1-dimension or 2-dimension. Note that offset
boosting does not produce a minus sign on the left-hand side of the equation, since
d(x jm + d jm) = d(x jm).

Constructing Conditional Symmetry from Single Offset
Boosting
A jerk system is a simple structure to pass the polarity, which consequently pro-
vides an easy way to consider polarity balance. Such a case can be found even in a
hypogenetic chaotic jerk ﬂow JH5 with absolute value nonlinearities [15], as follows:

˙y = z,
˙z = f (x) −y −az.

When a = 0.6, b = 1, f (x) = |x| −c, c = 2, the system (1) is chaotic and has
two coexisting symmetric attractors, with Lyapunov exponents (0.0534, 0, −0.6534)
and Kaplan-Yorke dimension DKY = 2.0817, as shown in Fig. 2. System (1) has four
equilibrium points, (±3, 1, 0), (±1, −1, 0), which may consist of the centers of dif-
ferent attractors. The symmetric coexistence of chaotic solutions can be explained
by a transformation. Even the structure of system (1) has no symmetry, a variable
boosting in the variable x can return a symmetry-like transformation, which is now
deﬁned as conditional symmetry and correspondingly give birth to symmetric bista-
bility. Speciﬁcally, let x = u + d, y = −v, z = −w(here, d is a new introduced
constant). If the condition c = (|x| + |u + d|)/2 is satisﬁed, the new deduced sys-
tem has a conditional rotational symmetry because the symmetry-like transformation
˙(u) = |v| −b, ˙(v) = w, ˙(w) = −|u + d| −v −aw + c can be obtained. In the new

space of variables u, v, w, the newly derived equations are conditionally identical to
the original one, when c −|u + d| = |x| −c. Here, the symmetry is obtained on the
condition equation in the z-dimension. The basins of attraction are shown in Fig.4a,
as predicted, although the regions in light blue and red representing two different
attractor basins are asymmetric, the strange attractors, represented in cross section
by black lines, are symmetric and nearly touch their basin boundaries. Two of the
equilibrium points are within the attracting basins, while the other two are on the
basin boundary. As shown in Fig.3, when b = 1.5, two asymmetric strange attractors
coexist, whose attracting basins are shown in Fig.4b. Here, the black lines of cross
section are asymmetric.
A similar chaotic system of conditional rotational symmetry can be obtained if
the absolute value function of y is replaced by a quadratic function rewritten as
⎧

˙x = y2 −a,
˙y = bz,
˙z = −y −z + f (x).

The revised system keeps on the polarity balance required for the symmetry trans-
formation from the polarity reversal of the function given by offset boosting. The sys-
tem (2) yields coexisting symmetric attractors according to the y-axis and z-axis, as
shown in Fig.5. System (2) has two groups of equilibria with the same stability when
a = 1.22, b = 8.48, f (x) = |x| −3, which are P11 = (4.1045, 1.1045, 0), P12 =

|u + c| −3 = 3 −|x|, the transformation x →u + c, y →−v, z →−w in Eq. (2)
is subject to the same governing equation and therefore generates coexisting rota-
tional symmetric attractors. The basin of attraction for the coexisting attractors shows
that the symmetric attractors lie in corresponding asymmetric basins [14].
As another case, we can construct a conditional reﬂection symmetric system by
introducing the absolute value function for returning a polarity balance based on
offset boosting [14], as follows:

fore it coexists with the other strange attractors [14]. The conditional symmetry of
Eq. (3) is obtained by the offset boosting of the variable x resulting in a polarity
reversal |u + c| −3 = 3 −|x|, which completes polarity balance for the conditional
symmetry transformation x →u + c, y →v, z →−w. Moreover, the conditional
symmetry can also be constructed by introducing other non-monotonic functions
F(x), such as F2(x) = 3 −|x|, F3(x)= 1.5sin(x), and F4(x)= 1.5cos(x). Since the
trigonometric functions sin(x) and cos(x) are also periodic, the attractor basin will
be correspondingly periodic giving two groups of inﬁnitely many duplication of the
attractors [13].

Constructing Conditional Symmetry from Multiple
Offset Boosting
More generally, conditional symmetry can be constructed from a structure with mul-
tiple offset boosting in addition to rigid variable-boostable systems [11]. Let us think,
if the goal is to construct a conditional reﬂection symmetric system given the polarity
reversal in the variable xi, the polarity revise of the dimension of xi on the left-hand
side of xi in turn requires the adjustment in the polarity with the terms on the right-
hand side of xi to get −fi(X). At the same time, all the other dimensions should keep
the polarity balance regardless of that −xi may introduce a minus sign on the right-
hand side, which further requires a new polarity reverse from offset boosting to cancel
it. Here, the polarity balance of a polynomial equation f j(X) is saved by introducing
new functions in f j(x1, x2, ..., −xi, ..., Fj1(x j1), Fj2(x j2), ..., Fjl(x jl), ..., xN) (1 ⩽
j1, ..., jl ⩽N, j1, ..., jl arenotidentical,andl isanodd)forvariables(x j1, x j2, ..., x jl),
which admits offset boosting returning a new minus sign to cancel the one from −xi,
by Fjm(x jm + d jm = −Fjm)(x jm) ( j1 ⩽jm ⩽jl).
Four general equations for hosting conditional symmetry are designed for exhaus-
tive computer searching [12]. We can conclude that Eqs. (4) and (5) can be trans-
formed to exhibit conditional symmetry from 1D offset boosting, while Eqs. (6) and
(7) can be modiﬁed to show conditional symmetry from 2D offset boosting. Equa-

Symmetric pairs of coexisting attractors in the conditional symmetric versions
are shown in Fig.7. Figure7a shows the coexisting attractors in CSS1 induced by
1D offset boosting in the y-dimension, while Fig.7b plots the coexisting symmetric
attractors in the plane x = 0, requiring an offset boosting in the z-dimension. Two
symmetric attractors in the plane z = 0 in system CSS3 demand offset boosting in
the x and y dimensions, as indicated in Fig.7c. In Fig.7d, two symmetric attractors in

356

the plane x = 0 in system CSS4 require offset boosting in the y and z dimensions. A
suitable threshold in the non-monotonic operation F(.) is necessary for restoring the
polarity balance under offset boosting. For F(x) = |x| −a, to obtain F(x + 2a) =
|x + 2a| −a = −F(x) (or, F(x −2a) = |x −2a| −a = −F(x)), the variable x
should be in the region [−2a , 0] (or, [0, 2a]) (a ⩾0). Modifying the threshold can
give coexisting asymmetric attractors [12], as shown in Fig.8.
5
Constructing Conditional Symmetric System from
Revised Polarity Balance
It is found that even a symmetric system [16–20] is possible to revise the polarity
balance to obtain the conditional symmetry. An easy example is from the rotational
symmetry in the Sprott B system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz,
˙y = x −y,
˙z = 1 −xy.
(8)
Here, the polarity balance maintains from −x and −y for the symmetric structure.
Meanwhile, the unique structure can still maintain its polarity balance when the
polarity is changed from an extra function without revising its basic dynamics, as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = G(z)y,
˙y = F1(x) −y,
˙z = c −F2(x)y.
(9)
When F1(x) = F2(x) = F(x) = |x| −5.5, G(z) = |z| −5, c = 1, system (9)
exhibits coexisting conditional reﬂection symmetric attractors with Lyapunov expo-
nents (0.2101, 0, −1.2101) and Kaplan-Yorke dimension DKY = 2.173, as shown in
Fig.9.
Mismatched offset boosting may result in asymmetric coexisting attractors. In
system (8), the variable x appears twice, and so two functions are necessary for con-
ditional symmetry. Moreover, these two functions should keep phase synchronization
for returning the same polarity reverse. As shown in Fig.10, when F1 = |x| −6.6,
F2 = |x| −6 and G(z) = |z| −5, two asymmetric strange attractors appear, as pre-
dicted. Offset controllers in different variables may keep independent from each
other, as shown in Fig.11. When F(x) = |x| −5.5, G(z) = |z| −b and b is varied,
as in Ref.[5, 9], the average of the variable z changes smoothly without revising the
averages of other variables x and y with the same Lyapunov exponents. As shown in
Fig.12, larger offset controller b makes the symmetric pair of coexisting attractors
farther in the z-dimension.
Normal bifurcation parameter c in system (9) control the dynamical behavior
dramatically. But inthespecial structureof conditional symmetry, system(9) displays

coexisting bifurcations from different initial conditions, as shown in Fig.13. The
common bifurcation controller c may lead to different evolutions, giving asymmetric
coexisting attractors, as shown in Fig.14.

Discussions and Conclusions
Multi-stability shows that various proﬁles, speciﬁcally symmetric strange attractors
and asymmetric ones, can coexist in asymmetric basins of attraction within a simple
nonlinear structure due to conditional symmetry. Offset boosting is the key routine
for restoring polarity balance and thereafter produces symmetric pairs of coexisting
attractors. Offset-boostable system provides a compact structure for coining condi-
tional symmetric system, while multiple dimensional offset boosting can ﬁnd more
cases of chaotic systems of conditional symmetry. Mismatched offset boosters may
draw the system to exhibit asymmetric coexisting attractors. The symmetric system
can also be transformed into a conditional symmetric one if the polarity balance is
restored based on offset boosting.

Introduction
As we discussed in the above chapters, many dynamical systems can produce similar
attractors, speciﬁcally some of which [1–10] share the same Lyapunov exponents. As
shown in Fig.1, a symmetric pair of coexisting attractors may be found in symmetric
systems [1–5] or conditional symmetric systems [6–10]. Those coexisting attractors
nested with each other, who are in a similar structure, can be found commonly in
asymmetric systems. As shown in Fig.1, in a dynamical system like an attractor
box, we can take out two or more coexisting attractors by selecting corresponding
initial conditions. So, a bold question comes out, that is, can we obtain any number
of attractors of the same Lyapunov exponents by giving different initial conditions?
The direct idea is that we can clone the original attractor inﬁnitely by a periodic
function and then choose the initial data according to the period of the clone function
[11–15].Adynamicalsystemwithinﬁnitelymanyclonedattractorsisnamedasaself-
reproducing system. In the following, we discuss how the attractor gets cloned based
on offset boosting and after that, different self-reproducing systems are obtained in
various dimensions.

Concept of Self-Reproducing System
Here, offset boosting is the key technology to clone the original attractor. As deﬁned
in the last chapter, offset boosting refers to a method that can shift any attractor
as well as its basin of attraction in the solution space of a dynamical system with-
out altering the system solutions. Any attractor in a smooth dynamical system can
obtain offset boosting by introducing an appropriate constant into any dimension
of the system. Generally, an attractor is limited in the variable space. For a smooth
dynamical system, ˙X = F(X), X = (x1, x2, ..., xn), introducing a constant vector a
= (a1, a2, ..., an) into each variable will give the system offset boosting within the
interval of a.
If there is a power to make the attractor walk in the variable space, then that
attractor can be cloned in any position and correspondingly the system outputs many
maybe inﬁnite coexisting attractors. As summarized in Fig.2, the attractor reproduc-
ing process based on the core operation of offset boosting. If an attractor can climb
along a speciﬁc route or axis under the action of a single constant, some of the foot-
prints of the climbing attractor can be solidiﬁed and consist of coexisting attractors,
which can be selected by initial conditions if the constant hides in a periodic or any
other non-monotonic functions. This operation depends on the fact that the derivative
of a constant is zero, a differential equation will not change its form if a constant is
added to a variable.
Deﬁnition 1 Suppose that there is a dynamical system, ˙X = F(X) (X = (x1, x2,
x3, ..., xi, ...) (i ∈N). If the offset boosting xi = ui + kP(k ∈N, P ∈Z) makes
the system recover its original governing equations, the system can reproduce its
own attractor by the periodic offset boosting, consequently it is deﬁned as a self-
reproducing system. Self-reproducing systems keep their form when any of the

Fig. 2 Process of attractor self-reproducing
variables is boosted, which means that the variable only varies in its initial space
while not altering the structure of the solution and not inﬂuencing its parameter
space. Many functions can be introduced to transform the dynamical system to be a
self-reproducing one, a typical example of which is the periodic function.
Theorem 1 For a three-dimensional self-reproducing system,
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = f (y, z),
˙y = g(y, z),
˙z = h(y, z) + F(x) .
(1)
if the function F(x) in the z-dimension is periodic and system (1) converges to an
attractor in one period, system (1) has inﬁnitely many attractors equally spaced
along the x-axis with a period P.
[Proof 1] Since F(x) is periodic, suppose F(x) = F(x + P), P ̸= 0 ∈R is the
period of the function F(x). Make a substitution x = x + kP (k ∈N) in system (1),
leading to the same form of Eq. (1), therefore, system (1) produces inﬁnitely many
identical attractors when the variable x varies by an integer multiple of P.
The approach for coining a self-reproducing system can be applied to other ordi-
nary differential equations. In this case, it becomes more complicated for introducing
bloated functions to transform a normal dynamical system for attractor hatching. To
boost the offset of any variable, more terms are necessary to change to adapt to that
and consequently more introduced functions for periodic offset-boosting get coupled
posing great threat on the dynamics [9]. Theoretically, any dimension in a dynamical
system can get offset boosted from the introduction of separating constants. After

that, replaced periodic functions transform those offset boosting constants to be nor-
malized periods resulting in a desired self-reproducing system releasing inﬁnitely
many attractors.

[Proof 2] Since gl(xl) is a periodic function, there exists a constant Pl and an
integer Sl, such that gl(xl + SlPl) = gl(xl), l ∈{ j1, j2, ..., jm}. With a variable sub-
stitution x′

(3)
Equation (3) recovers the same structure as Eq. (2), indicating that periodic-
function-equipped system (2) is a self-reproducing system, releasing inﬁnitely many
attractors in phase space according to the period of the newly introduced function.
For better demonstration, here we give an example with easy offset boosting. As
reported in Refs.[15–17], many chaotic systems have the freedom for offset boosting.
The Sprott S system is such a simple one [15] (see Table 1):
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −x −4y,
˙y = x + z2,
˙z = 1 + x.
(4)
This system has six terms, three of which are x-terms, one is y-term, one is
constant and one is quadratic term. The system is chaotic with Lyapunov exponents
(0.2006, 0, −1.2006) and Kaplan-Yorke dimension DKY = 2.1670. Obviously, the
offset boosting of the variable y can be obtained by a constant introduction in the ﬁrst
dimension. To make it simple, by variable substitution (variable exchange between
x and y, and then a second exchange between y and z followed with additional
amplitude rescaling in the variable x (to be 1/4 x)), and we transform Eq. (4) to the
following:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = 4y2 + 4 ∗z,
˙y = 1 + z,
˙z = −x −z.

(6)
The constant c lifts the attractor along the x-axis without changing the fundamental
dynamics, as shown in Fig.3. Note that the x-coordinate of the initial condition
(4, 0.01, 0) should vary with the constant c for avoiding the unbounded solution.
We can imagine that the last step to obtain a self-reproducing system from Eq. (6)
could be resort to a period function substitution. In the following, we will give further
demonstration on the process of attractor hatching.

Self-Reproducing Chaotic Systems with 1D Inﬁnitely
Many Attractors
Our idea for obtaining many coexisting attractors is based on the fact that if the
boosting controller c in the right-hand side of Eq. (6) can disappear when speciﬁc
non-monotonic or other periodic functions are introduced while the fundamental
dynamics of the system can survive, and the revised system can give multiple states
according to the property of the non-monotonic functions. To make an easy demon-
stration, we introduce a sine function in the last dimension of Eq. (6),
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = 4y2 + 4 ∗z,
˙y = 1 + z,
˙z = F(x) −c.
(7)
The newly introduced trigonometric function of sine, F(x) = −9sin(0.25x), is peri-
odic, and therefore the offset boosting in the variable x will appear in a new form of
returning a similar attractor at different position generating a special multi-stability.
As shown in Fig.4, when the initial condition of x varies, periodically-distributed
coexisting attractors are visited. To change the initial location of the coexisting attrac-
tors, an additional initial phase should be introduced in the sine function. Lyapunov
exponents for system (7) under different initial conditions as shown in Fig.5a indi-
cate that all the attractors have the same Lyapunov exponents (0.1992, 0, −1.1992)
and the corresponding Kaplan-Yorke dimension DKY is 2.1662 [(slightly revised
compared with Eq. (6], which are different from those for Eq. 1. When the initial
condition varies as (0 + 8kπ, 0.01, 0(−50 ⩽k ∈Z ⩽50)), the average variable of
the variable x is revised accordingly as shown in Fig.5, without any change in the
Lyapunov exponents.
Furthermore, other trigonometric functions such as the tangent function can be
applied for reproducing attractors. When F(x) = −9tan(0.1x), system (7) generates

(−50 ⩽k ∈Z ⩽50), the time-average of x change accordingly, while system (7)
has the same strange attractor with invariant Lyapunov exponents as shown in Fig.6.
The distribution of the basins of the attraction in system (7) is determined by the
chosen trigonometric function.

Self-Reproducing Chaotic Systems with 2D Lattices of
Coexisting Attractors
If offset boosting extends to two or more dimensions, correspondingly coexisting
attractors can be hatched when the offset boosting is realized by initial conditions.
Interestingly, a jerk ﬂow ...x = (x, ˙x, ¨x) can be transformed to a 2D offset-boostable
system [18, 19] by introducing two other variables y and z, like

366
C. Li and J. C. Sprott
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y,
˙y = z,
˙z = f (˙x, ˙y, x),
(8)
where offset boosting of the variables y and z can be obtained by introducing extra
constants in the ﬁrst two equations [19]. In jerk ﬂows, the offset boosting is produced
in cascade, where the offset boosting is from the preceding variable. One of the
simplest cases JD0 [16], ...x = −2.02¨x + ¨x2 −x), can be modiﬁed to be a three-
dimensional system with 2D offset boosting of y and z: ˙x = y + m, ˙y = z + n,
˙z = −2.02 ˙y + ˙x2 −x. Chaoticmemoryoscillators [20] canbetransformedfor offset
boosting as well. Conservative system does not have attractors but can exhibit chaos.
Nose-Hoover oscillator [21, 22], ˙x = y, ˙y = yz −x, ˙z = 1 −y2, can be written
in jerk form [23] and thus admits 2D offset boosting in this type of conservative
systems. Generally, while controlling the offset by introducing a constant, the initial
conditions should be adjusted accordingly to remain in the basin of the attractor since
most of the chaotic systems are not global attracting.
Theorem 3 A 2D self-reproducing system can be constructed from the system
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = F(y),
˙y = G(z),
˙z = f (˙x, ˙y, x),
(9)
which produces inﬁnitely many identical attractors if it has a bounded solution (an
attractor) for one period and if the functions F(y) and G(z) are periodic.
[Proof 3] For the periodic functions F(y) and G(z), suppose that P1 and P2
are their respective periods, i.e., F(y) = F(y + P1) and G(z) = G(z + P2). For
x = u, y = v + kP1), z = w + lP2) (k,l ∈Z), the system (9) becomes
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙u = F(v),
˙v = G(w),
˙w = f (˙u, ˙v, u).
(10)
System (10) is identical to system (9), indicating that introducing the constants kP1
and lP2 does not change the property of system (9) but gives corresponding offset
boosting in the dimensions of y and z, which consequently reproduces inﬁnitely
many attractors on a lattice in the y-z plane. The time derivatives on the left-hand
side of Eq. (10) associated with offset can be easily removed.
The chaotic memory oscillator MO4 [20], ...x + 0.5¨x + ˙x = x(x −1), can be
transformed to a self-reproducing system,
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = sin(y),
˙y = 1.05sin(z),
˙z = −˙x −0.5 ˙y −x + x2 ,

tial conditions are (0, 0.1 + 2kπ, 0 + 2lπ(−1 ⩽k,l ∈Z ⩽1)), (b) regulated offset when initial
conditions are (0, 0.1 −2kπ, 0 + 2kπ(−50 ⩽k ∈Z ⩽50))
which has an inﬁnite 2D lattice of strange attractors with Lyapunov exponents
(0.0890 ± 0.0001, 0, −0.5808) and a Kaplan-Yorke dimension of 2.1534. Figure8a
shows nine of the coexisting attractors when the initial conditions are selected
according to (0, 0.1 −2kπ, 0 + 2lπ(−1 ⩽k, l ∈Z ⩽1)). Figure8b shows that the
time-averaged values of y and z on the various attractors are proportional to k for
−50 ⩽k = l ∈Z ⩽50, while the average of x remains unchanged as expected.
Other trigonometric functions such as the tangent function can also be applied for
offset periodization:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = 1.1tan(y),
˙y = 0.9tan(z),
˙z = −˙x −0.5 ˙y −x + x2.
(12)
In this case, the attractors are arranged with a period of π. Comparing Fig.8 with
Fig.7 shows that the spaces between adjacent attractors shrink, and the time-average
of the variables y and z are also changed [19].
For a symmetric system, a symmetric pair of attractors can also be reproduced
with the same distribution [19]. System MO5, ...x + 0.7¨x + ˙x = x(1 −x2), can be
revised to be 2D self-reproducing system by introducing two sine functions, as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = asin(y),
˙y = bsin(z),
˙z = −˙x −0.7 ˙y + x −x3.
(13)
System (13) preserves the dynamics of the original system. For a = 1.55, b = 1.1,
system (13) has an inﬁnite 2D lattice of symmetric strange attractor with Lyapunov
exponents (0.1122, 0, −0.8120) and a Kaplan-Yorke dimension of 2.1382. While
when a = 5, b = 1.1, the solution turns to be an inﬁnite 2-D lattice of symmetric pair
of strange attractors with Lyapunov exponents (0.1587, 0, −0.8795) and a Kaplan-

Similarly, a hyperjerk ﬂow d4x
dt4 = (x, ˙x, ¨x, ...x ) can produce its 3D offset-boosting [9]
by introducing three other variables y, z and u, according to
⎧
⎪⎪⎨

˙x = y,
˙y = z,
˙z = u,
˙u = f (˙x, ˙y, ˙z, x).

Periodic functions can be introduced for coining a self-reproducing system, like
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙x = F(y),
˙y = G(z),
˙z = H(u),
˙u = f (˙x, ˙y, ˙z, x).
(15)
Therefore, inﬁnitely many identical attractors can be hatched in the corresponding
3D space if system (15) has a bounded solution (an attractor) for one period. Here,
the functions F(y), G(z), and H(u) are periodic.
Chlouverakis and Sprott [20] found what may be the algebraically simplest hyper-
chaotic snap system given by ....x + x4....x + a ¨x + ˙x + x = 0, with a single parameter
a = 3.6 and Lyapunov exponents (0.1310, 0.0358, 0, −1.2550) and a Kaplan-Yorke
dimension of 3.1329. After two-step operation, one is offset boosting and the other
is periodization. The above system obtains its new version of self-reproducing pro-
viding a 3D lattice of hyperchaotic strange attractors in a form with six-sinusoidal
functions [9], as
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙x = F(y),
˙y = G(z),
˙z = H(u),
˙u = −x4˙z −a ˙y −b ˙x −x.
(16)
When a = 3.6, b = 1, F(y) = 2.5sin(0.4y), G(z) = 4sin(0.25z), H(u) = 8sin
(0.125u), System (14) exhibits an inﬁnite 3D lattice of hyperchaotic strange attrac-
tors with Lyapunov exponents (0.1013, 0.0306, 0, −1.1340) and a Kaplan-Yorke
dimension of 3.1163. Periodic initial condition takes out inﬁnitely many hyperchaotic
attractors, as shown in Fig. 10, the periods of sin(0.4y), sin(0.25z), and sin(0.125u),
increase as 5kπ, 8kπ, 16kπ, determining the distances between two attractors of
the lattice. As shown in Fig.11, the offset of y, z and u is modulated according to
initial conditions without inﬂuencing the Lyapunov exponents.
Other hyperchaotic systems can be transformed for releasing an inﬁnite lattice of
hyperchaotic attractors, such as Ref.[24]

˙x = y −x,
˙y = −xz + u,

[24]. 1D lattice of hyperchaotic attractors can be easily obtained, since system (17) is
a variable-boostable one in the u-dimension. Additional periodic functions can still
reproduce the attractor in other dimensions in a bloated equation:

When a = 2.6, b = 0.44, g1(x) = x, g2(y) = y, g3(z) = z, g4(u) = 2.5sin(0.4u),
system (18) gives an inﬁnite 1D lattice of hyperchaotic strange attractors, with
Lyapunov exponents (0.0995, 0.0118, 0, −1.1113) and Kaplan-Yorke dimension
of 3.1001. An inﬁnite 2D lattice of hyperchaotic strange attractors can be coined
by a further function substitution like g1(x) = x, g2(y) = y, g3(z) = 8sin(0.125z),
g4(u) = 2.5sin(0.4u), releasing a lattice of hyperchaotic attractors, with Lyapunov
exponents (0.1097, 0.0081, 0, −1.1175) and Kaplan-Yorke dimension of 3.1052, as
shown in Fig.12.
More functions introduced may destroy the basic property for giving hyper-
chaos. When a = 2.6, b = 0.44, let g1(x) = 8sin( x

in Fig.13.
System (18) also has no equilibria, and therefore all the coexisting attrac-
tors are hidden [25–28]. System (18) retains its rotational symmetry about the
z-plane and therefore all the attractors are symmetric. Other trigonometric func-
tions such as cosine, tangent, or cotangent functions can also be applied for attrac-
tor self-reproducing. When g1(x) = 8sin( x

difference between the sine and cosine functions leads to a conditional symmetry, as
shown in Fig.14.
We can construct a perhaps simplest 3D self-reproducing system by introducing
sine functions in the Thomas system with a cyclically symmetry, as

˙x = sin(ay) −bsin(x),
˙y = sin(az) −bsin(y),
˙z = sin(ax) −bsin(z).

Here, all the terms are spatially periodic. The resulting system admits multiple
coexisting solutions depending on the initial conditions. When a = 4.75, b = 1, system
(19) has a self-excited chaotic attractor near the origin, with Lyapunov exponents
(0.2822, 0, −2.9562) and Kaplan-Yorke dimension of 2.0955 [9]. The strange attrac-
tor is shown in Fig. 15. The projections onto different orthogonal planes have the
same shape, since system (19) has cyclical symmetry.
Other trigonometric functions such as tangent can also be introduced for attractor
reproducing, e.g.,
⎧

˙x = sin(ay) −b tan(x),
˙y = sin(az) −b tan(y),
˙z = sin(ax) −b tan(z).

When a = 8, b = 1, system (20) has a chaotic attractor with Lyapunov exponents
(0.2007, 0, −3.4812) and Kaplan-Yorke dimension of 2.0577, as shown in Fig.16.
When initial conditions vary, like (0 + 2k1π, 0.1 + 2k2π, 0 + 2k3π) (k1, k2, k3 ∈
{−1, 0, 1}), a total of 27 coexisting attractors can be seen in Fig. 17.

Discussions and Conclusions
Self-reproducing system is deﬁned as a new regime of multi-stable system, which
releases inﬁnitely many attractors with the same Lyapunov exponents. An effective
approach to construct this new version is to resort to offset boosting. Although bloated
equip of periodic functions cannot guarantee to reproduce inﬁnitely many attractors
of the same property as the original system, jerk or snap (hyperjerk) system brings a
convenient chance to imbed periodic functions for attractor self-reproducing. In this
chapter, an inﬁnite lattice of 1D–3D chaotic/hyperchaotic attractors is obtained. Self-
reproducing systems releasing 1D–4D chaotic attractors are constructed. Conditional
symmetry can also be preserved in this kind of dynamical systems if the polarity
balance is maintained from a function rather than a direct variable. The distance
betweentwocoexistingattractorsisdeﬁnedbytheperiodofthereproducingfunction.
When the distance is small enough, the boundary between two coexisting attractors
becomes more fragile, which leads to the attractor number growth.

Introduction
Multi-stability is ubiquitous in dynamical systems, thereby attracting a great deal of
interest for its potential threats or beneﬁts to engineering systems and applications.
A multi-stable system has much more complicated dynamics for its many-to-many
mapping between system parameters and initial conditions. To date, identifying the
basins of attraction depending on the ergodic initial conditions [1–10] has been
applied widely for identifying multi-stability. For us, it is an urgent task to determine
which kind of dynamical systems have coexisting attractors. However, there is a long
way to go to ﬁnd multi-stability theoretically, or practically but more efﬁciently.
From the existence analysis of multi-stability, we can get some clues for predicting
the multi-stability. In fact, the complexity of multi-stability analysis can be reduced
since an n-dimensional system has (m-(n+1)) independent parameters (m refers to the
number of the terms in the equation) and any of which can provide an observation
window for multi-stability. On the other hand, we have already seen that multi-
stability can lead to the failure of amplitude control [11] and offset boosting, when
the initial conditions are ﬁxed. Therefore, in turn, the parameter for amplitude control
or offset boosting provides a new method for detecting multi-stability, where the
amplitude control or offset boosting with a ﬁxed initial condition may involve in
different solutions betraying the multi-stability with hops of Lyapunov exponents
[12, 13].
As is well known, different kinds of attractors, including stable equilibria, period-
icity, quasi-periodicity, chaos, and hyperchaos, have different largest-two Lyapunov

exponents. Therefore, apowerful methodfor identifyingandquantifyingthedynamic
is to use the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, whose number is equal to the number
of dynamical variables and that are usually ordered from the largest (most positive)
to the smallest (most negative) [14, 15].
Considering a two-dimensional space of the second largest Lyapunov exponent,
λ1 and λ2 (λ1 ⩾λ2), as shown in Fig. 1. From deﬁnition, the stable equilibria (SE)
lie on or below the 45-degree line in the lower left quadrant, limit cycles (LC) locate
along the negative λ2-axis, toruses (T ) locate at the origin, chaotic attractors (C)
locate along the positive λ1-axis, and hyperchaotic attractors (H) are in the upper
right quadrant. For a dynamical system with different kinds of coexisting attractors,
a scatter plot in the plane for different initial conditions will show clusters of points
corresponding to the different coexisting attractors and will identify their types.
Similarly, for a given initial condition, different settings of the amplitude control
and offset boosting will generally cause the system to visit the basins of most if not
all of the attractors, especially if the basin boundaries are fractal, which is common
in nonlinear dynamical systems that are multi-stable. However, for some dynamical
systems, the attracting basin is simple or symmetrical about some axis or original
point, and so an appropriate initial condition must be chosen to increase the likelihood
of visiting all the basins as the amplitude or offset is adjusted.
The above-mentioned alternative methods resort to non-bifurcation operations,
where the basins of attractions are linearly transformed so as to generate a dynamical
dispersion against the ﬁxed initial condition. As shown in Fig. 2, amplitude control
and offset boosting provide two basic linear transformations. Amplitude control
corresponds to the rescaling of the basins of attraction, while the offset boosting
shifts the basins of attraction in any direction. Therefore, the multiple coexisting
attractors can be ﬁshed out by a ﬁxed initial condition since the initial data ﬂoats into
different basins of attraction under a linear transformation [12, 13].

Multistability Identiﬁcation by Amplitude Control
Amplitude control [16–20] makes the attractor larger or smaller by changing the
scale of some or all of the variables without changing the dynamical and topological
properties of the attractor.
Suppose that there is a p-dimensional multi-stable system with an amplitude
parameter, ˙X = F(a, X), where a is an amplitude controller. When a = a1, the
basins for coexisting strange attractor, torus, limit cycle and point attractor are
Ω11, Ω12, Ω13, Ω14, while when a = a2 these basins become Ω21, Ω22, Ω23, Ω24.
Let Di j = Ω1i ∩Ω2 j (1 ≤i ≤4, 1 ≤j ≤4, i ̸= j). For example, if the initial con-
dition is set as X0 = (x10, x20, ..., x p0) ∈Di j, when the amplitude parameter a
increases from a1 to a2, the second largest Lyapunov exponent can switch from
positive to negative if a basin boundary is crossed between a hyperchaotic strange
attractor and a limit cycle. In fact, if the amplitude controller rescales the basins of
attraction without revising the corresponding initial conditions, different dynamical
behaviors may occur for different settings of the amplitude control, which consists
of a new method for identifying coexisting attractors. The above mechanism hidden
in the process is shown in Fig. 3.
The method has been proved valid for checking the coexistence of the point
attractor, limit cycle and strange attractor [21]. Here, we check the effectiveness of
multi-stability diagnosis based on amplitude control in the revised Rössler system
[22], which has a partial amplitude controller h, as
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −y −yz,
˙y = x + ay,
˙z = b + z(hx2 −c).
(1)
Here, the coefﬁcient h controls the amplitudes of the variables x and y according
to 1/
√
h, while the amplitude of z is unchanged. When a = 0.39, b = 2.23, c = 4.71,
the Lyapunov exponent spectrum and its distribution for initial condition (1, 0, 2)
is shown in Fig. 4, showing the coexistence of a strange attractor and a limit cycle.
However, a similar distribution of Lyapunov exponent spectrum is obtained when
a = 0.34, b = 1.7, c = 5.03. Since the coexisting attractors are asymmetric while

distribution for initial condition (1, 0, 2)
the system is symmetric, we can easily conclude that the system has four coexisting
attractors, including a symmetric pair of limit cycles and symmetric pairs of strange
attractors, as shown in Fig. 5. Amplitude control with ﬁxed initial conditions provides
a tool for identifying coexisting attractors in a dynamical system that may be more
convenient in practical applications than exploring all possible initial conditions.
Note that the Lyapunov exponent calculation typically converges more slowly than
other measures such as the location and size of an attractor, especially the second
largest Lyapunov exponent, which may be one of the disadvantages of identifying
multi-stability with amplitude control.
Amplitude rescaling for multi-stability still works for higher-dimensional dynam-
ical systems if one of the Lyapunov exponents is used for stability identiﬁcation, for

When a = 6, b = 0.1, system (2) has solutions of a torus and a symmetric pair of
coexisting chaotic attractors, as shown in Fig.6, which can be identiﬁed by Lyapunov
exponent spectrum and its distribution under a ﬁxed initial condition like the case
above. Here, we recognized that the symmetric coexistence is not captured until
the special structure is considered. What is worse is that the method of rescaling
the basins of attraction by amplitude control does not guarantee to ﬁsh up all the
coexisting solutions. An obvious reason is that if the basin of attraction for a speciﬁc
attractor extends in one direction or large enough, then the basin in that direction
cannot be rescaled since ±∞over a real parameter remains to be so. As a result, the
relative motion of initial condition along that direction will not disclose any change
of the basin, therefore cannot catch up the corresponding coexisting attractor. As an
effective alternative method, the following approach based on offset boosting can
be applied effectively to detect the coexisting cases, for which the amplitude control
cannot especially ﬁnd those coexisting symmetric attractors.

Multi-Stability Identiﬁcation by Offset Boosting
Offset boosting [24–27] can shift the basin along any direction, which provides an
effective way for ﬁshing multiple attractors. Variable-boostable systems studied in
Ref.[24] provide a special regime where some of the variables can get offset boosted

with a single independent constant. More generally, the offset boosting is from a
variable substitution, which needs newly introduced constants, depending on how
many times the variable shows up in the differential equation. But this concern is
superﬂuous; the following practical tests show that offset boosting can catch up
the coexisting attractors from even a single direction. Offset boosting does give a
dynamical dispersion useful to see multiple solutions since a ﬁxed initial condition
visits different basins of attraction while the offset gets boosted.
Without loss of generality, consider the case where constants a, b are scalars.
Suppose that the system has ﬁve coexisting attractors, i.e., a point attractor, two limit
cycles A, B, a chaotic attractor, and a hyperchaotic attractor. If the shift constant
a, b are positive, the basins of attraction will move along the negative direction, and
vice versa. Here, the offset boosting of dimension x or y, combined with the whole
basin of attraction, will be controlled according to the constant a or b. As shown in
Fig.7, the ﬁxed initial condition A (red point) for limit cycle A will visit the basin
of chaos when the offset booster a is negative through relative movement, while
the initial condition B (purple point) still stay in the basin of point until the offset
of y is shifted by the positive booster b and thereafter triggers another oscillation
of limit cycle B. Here, the offset boosting in any direction reaches such an extent
that the ﬁxed initial condition can cross the boundary and visit different basins of
attraction. By this relative movement, the ﬁxed initial condition A or B can ﬁsh
out different possible attractors and diagnose them thereafter. Different kinds of
attractors correspond to their speciﬁc Lyapunov exponents, and the ﬁxed-initial-
conditionoffsetboostingmodiﬁestheLyapunovexponentsaccordingly,whichshows
various combinations of multi-stability, as shown in Fig.1. The regime of coexistence
with multiple attractors can be indicated from the distribution of the two largest
Lyapunov exponents [13]. Moreover, since the offset boosting in any dimension
revises the corresponding average of the variable, any newly introduced attractor can
destroy the linearly scaled offset, betraying new coexisting attractors.
We can check the coexisting attractors following this routine based on offset
boosting. In system (1), there is a quadratic term and another cubic term of z, a cubic

term of x; therefore, for simple offset boosting we select the dimension of y for
identifying coexisting attractors. The newly introduced constant is in the following:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −(y + d) −(y + d)z,
˙y = x + a(y + d),
˙z = b + z(hx2 −c).
(3)
As shown in Fig.8, when the offset parameter d varies in [−1, 1], the average
value of variable y decreases accordingly, while the average values of variables x
and z remain unchanged simultaneously, except some unexpected changes indicating
multiple coexisting attractors. The offset boosting identiﬁes the coexisting attractors
effectively, giving two groups of the corresponding Lyapunov exponents like the
distribution shown in Fig.4b. Two-dimensional offset may provide a more effective
diagnose despite that the equation has a heavy non-bifurcation parameter setting
since we do not know how the basins of attraction is extending in any dimension.
The scissors of offset boosting show the coexisting attractors with the same Lyapunov
exponent distribution, as shown in Fig.9.
In this case, the system is
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −(y + d) −(y + d)(z −d),
˙y = x + a(y + d),
˙z = b + (z −d)(hx2 −c).

Offset boosting can also be applied to the higher-dimensional systems. When
a = 6, b = 0.1, system (2) has a symmetrical pair of strange attractors and a torus;

when a = 7, b = 0.1, system (2) has a symmetrical pair of strange attractors and a

are caught up from the abnormal average value collapse. Here, the offset boosting
process can be applied to three dimensions, y, z, u, as follows:

As shown in Fig.10, for a system with two symmetric attractors, even their corre-
sponding Lyapunov exponents are identical, the proposed method works very well.

Independent Amplitude Controller and Offset Booster
4.1
Constructing Independent Amplitude Controller
In order to realize the prediction of multi-stability with a direct amplitude controller,
we need to ﬁnd or even introduce a single knob into the dynamic system without
inﬂuencing the fundamental dynamics of the original system. It happens that sym-
metric systems usually have multi-stability and simultaneously have one amplitude
parameter for partial control or total control [16]. Besides, we can even obtain a total
amplitude controller in a system by degree modiﬁcation [28]. Our degree modiﬁca-
tion depends on the application of the signum function and the absolute function.
This is based on the fact that many dynamical systems can preserve their fundamental
solutions when the polarity of some of the variables is kept while the amplitude is
removed, or some of the terms get an amplitude ampliﬁcation while keeping its orig-
inal polarity. A cute example is shown in Ref.[28] with the Sprott B system (Table 1),
where six cases are obtained to unify the original system to be of the desired degree
except one term. We know now that this transformation will preserve the original
equilibria if ignoring the coordinate shifting. Under certain circumstances, one inﬁ-
nite line of equilibria or even two perpendicular lines of equilibria may be introduced,
which will inevitably revise the basin of attraction when the multi-stability exists.
Take the revised Sprott B systems for examples:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = z sgn(y),
˙y = x −y,
˙z = a|x| −m xy ,
(6)

⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz,
˙y = x|x| −y|x|,
˙z = m|x| −a xy .
(7)
The parameter m is an amplitude parameter, while the only left parameter a is for
bifurcation control. The system (6) (AB2) has a newly introduced line of equilibria,
(0,0, z),witheigenvalue(0, 0, −1),whilethesystem(7)(AB5)hastwoperpendicular
lines of equilibria, (0, y, 0) and (0, 0, z), with eigenvalues (√a ∗|y|, 0, √a ∗|y|) and
(0, 0, 0), respectively. When m = 1 and a = 1.2, both systems have a symmetric pair
of coexisting strange attractors, as shown in Fig.11. However, the basins of attraction
are rearranged, as shown in Fig.12. Note that although the degree modiﬁcation
can preserve the basic properties of the original system and strip out an amplitude
parameter, this does not mean that the original system gives the multi-stability under
the same parameter. In fact, the original Sprott B system has the same coexisting
solutions at the parameter near a = 0.32 [28]. From the above analysis, we may
conclude that generally a direct variable substitution with the dynamical system,
such as x = ku, y = v, z = w, the deduced parameter k will be a good detector for
multi-stability, even it may exist in many terms rather than a single term.

Finding Independent Offset Booster
Typically, it is not easy to ﬁnd a single independent offset booster in a chaotic
system since different variables get tangled for coining chaos. But, we can still ﬁnd
some simple chaotic systems with a single independent offset booster by exhausting
computer-based searching [24]. For such a dynamic system, if the variable x needs
to be boosted by a single constant, the differential equation can be designed in the
following form, where the extra constant is introduced in the z-dimension:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a1y + a2z + a3y2 + a4z2 + a5yz + a16,
˙y = a6y + a7z + a8y2 + a9z2 + a10yz + a17,
˙z = a11y + a12z + a13y2 + a14z2 + a15yz + a18x .
(8)
Similarly, the variables y and z can be boosted by other newly introduced constants
in other dimensions. However, all such cases can be written in the form of Eq. (8),
without loss of generality, through a simple transformation of variables [24]. Twenty-
four new cases were found [24], as shown in Table1 any of which has a single
independent offset booster c in the last dimension. The strange attractors are shown
in Fig.13. Offset booster c modiﬁes the average value of the variable x linearly,
except an extra attractor showing up, indicating multi-stability. As shown in Fig.14,
when c varies in [−10, 10], the average value of the variable x is linearly scaled
with occasionally hopping up and down in some other dimensions, indicating the
coexistence of multiple attractors. In this case, the boosting controller c can ﬁsh
out different solutions when it moves into the basin of attraction in the direction of
the x-dimension. As shown in Fig.14a, when a = 3.6, c = 0, VB5 has a symmetric

pair of strange attractors. The boosting controller c varies from −5 to 5, giving two
symmetric attractors, which have different average values of the variable z. For the
variable x, the switch in polarity in different attractors does not change their sizes,
and the average value of x declines with c. As shown in Fig.15b, the switch between
two symmetric attractors for ﬁxed initial conditions leads to two different levels of
the average value of z, giving an irregular waveform as expected from the complex
fractal basins of attraction.
For a 3D chaotic system, it is more difﬁcult to obtain two independent offset
boosters. Fortunately, the jerk equation provides us a green channel for inserting two
independent offset boosters. It is easy to verify that a jerk ﬂow ...x = (x, ˙x, ¨x) can
obtain its two offset controllers [27], as

˙x = y + d,
˙y = z + e,

Fig. 16 2D offset-boostable strange attractors
Since f (˙x, ˙y, x) depends on the time derivatives of x and y, which is not altered
by the constants e and d, Eq. (9) provides offset boosting of the variables y and z.
In jerk ﬂows, the offset boosting is produced in cascade, where the offset boosting
is based on the preceding variable. The simplest case of this type is JD0 [29], ...x =
−2.02¨x + ˙x2 −x, which can be modiﬁed to be a 3D system with 2D offset boosting
of y and z, as follows:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y + d,
˙y = z + e,
˙z = −2.02 ˙y + ˙x2 −x .
(10)
As shown in Fig.16, when d and e are varied in [−10, 10], the average values of
y and z were rescaled linearly but the shifted attractor of system (10) has the same
Lyapunov exponents.
Another regime of chaotic systems has two independent offset booster in inter-
active mode, where the offset boosting of two dimensions comes from a constant
in the other dimension. Speciﬁcally, if the offset boosting of x is obtained in the
y-dimension, while the offset boosting of y needs to be realized in the x-dimension,
the general structure can be designed as

From an exhaustive computer search, eight chaotic cases restricted to no more
than seven terms were captured with attractors, as shown in Fig.16. The basic infor-
mation including parameters, initial conditions and Lyapunov exponents, are shown
in Table2. As shown in Fig.15, in this case, when m and n are varied, the average
values of x and y are linearly rescaled, but without changing the Lyapunov exponents
of the chaotic attractors, showing that the system OB1 has no coexisting attractors.
A similar mathematic transformation can be explored according to the above two
cases. For higher-dimensional chaotic systems, it is relatively easier to obtain two or
more independent offset boosters.

Conclusions
Multiple coexisting attractors usually have different Lyapunov exponents and geo-
metric properties. Basins of attraction show the coexistence from exhaustive
computer-based searching, which takes more effort and time consumption. For an
nD dynamical system, the initial condition in any dimension needs to vary in a suit-
able region for observing coexisting attractors. Basically, the basin of attraction of
a dynamical system has a fractural structure, which leaves an opportunity for multi-
stability identiﬁcation even by a single ﬁxed initial condition. When the amplitude
or offset of the attractor is rescaled, the corresponding basins will get contraction,
expansion, and translation. Therefore, the ﬁxed initial data drop into different basins
and trigger the corresponding attractor. In this chapter, two basic approaches of multi-
stability identiﬁcation are presented and explained, based on a ﬁxed initial condition.
Furthermore, an independent amplitude controller was obtained by degree modiﬁ-
cation, and chaotic systems with independent offset booster were classiﬁed.

Introduction
Differential equations with impulses (jumps) constitute a wide class of functional
differential equations and play a signiﬁcant role in various ﬁelds of science and
technology (see, e.g., Refs. [1–3]). First papers on impulsive equations with delay
date back to the 1980s [4, 5]. Later, the theory of delay impulsive equations was
developed in depth in a number of publications, see e.g. Refs. [6–14].
Impulsive differential equations with delay have found numerous applications in
mathematical modeling of biological systems, including cellular neural networks,
models of population dynamics, dynamics of red blood cells and of hematopoiesis
[15, 16].
In Ref.[17], the authors proposed to describe non-basal testosterone regulation
in the male by means of impulsive differential equations. The impulsive model was
based on a continuous-time one put forward by W.R. Smith [18, 19]. Notice that the

Smith model represents, in its turn, a version of a construct known in mathematical
biology as Goodwin’s oscillator [20]. The model in Ref.[17] incorporated the discrete
dynamics due to the episodic release of hormones that are suitably captured by an
impulsive feedback [21]. More recently, the impulsive modiﬁcation of the Smith
model was successfully validated on biological data [22]. It was shown to exhibit
rich dynamics, including high multiplicity cycles and deterministic chaos [23].
In order to explicate the role of the transport phenomena in endocrine regula-
tion and extend the parametric domain of self-sustained oscillations, the original
(continuous) Smith model was augmented with a time delay, which construct was
intensively studied over the years, see e.g. Refs. [19, 24–30]. Similarly, time delays
were introduced in the impulsive model [31–33]. The main dynamical analysis tool
employed there was a discrete Poincaré map [34] capturing the impulse-to-impulse
evolution of the system states in the phase space. Poincaré maps are instrumental in
bifurcation analysis of complex nonlinear dynamics due to their superior numerical
properties compared to direct integration of differential equations [35].
The results on the impulsive model in Refs.[31–33] were obtained under limiting
assumptions on the delay. It was found that the ratio between the time-delay value
and the time interval between two consecutive impulses has a profound impact on
the dynamics. For small time delays with the ratio values under one, the impulsive
oscillator does not acquire new types of dynamical behavior compared to the delay-
free case. For larger but limited to a certain interval time delays (see Refs. [36–39]),
such complex nonlinear dynamics phenomena as multi-stability and quasi-periodic
solutions have been discovered.
Multi-stability, i.e. coexistence of a set of attractors in the phase space of a dynam-
ical system, is a typical nonlinear phenomenon. During the past six years, there
has been a signiﬁcant interest in multi-stability associated with the appearance of
unpredictable attractors referred to as “hidden attractors” [40–42]. The historical
background and a survey of the dynamical systems that display hidden attractors are
outlined in the recent papers [42, 43]. By virtue of the particular numerical, exper-
imental, and conceptual challenges they present, systems with hidden attractors are
presently in the focus of intensive research, as evidenced by a rapidly growing number
of publications in the last few years (see e.g. the references in Refs.[42, 43]).
Following the deﬁnition provided in Refs.[42] with respect to systems of smooth
differential equations, an attractor is called hidden if its basin of attraction does not
intersect with small neighborhoods of equilibria. By this deﬁnition, any attractor
(periodic, quasi-periodic or chaotic) in a system without equilibria is deemed hidden
[44]. An extensive list of references to practical examples of smooth systems without
equilibria can be found in Ref.[44]. Another relevant scenario is a system excited by
a periodic external signal [43].
Systems without equilibria are especially frequent among impulsive or switched
systems (see e.g. Refs. [39, 45–47]). A characteristic feature of such systems is that
they usually allow a discrete time (Poincaré) map that describes the evolution of
the system’s continuous state variables from impulse to impulse or from switch to
switch [34]. Thus a study of the orbits in such a system is reduced to iterating of the
discrete-time system constituted by the Poincaré map. In particular, any m-periodic

solution of the discrete time system corresponding to a periodic orbit of the impulsive
(or switched) system with m impulses (or switches) in the period (such orbit is called
m-cycle).
Under amplitude and frequency pulse modulation in the feedback path, the model
introduced in Ref.[17] lacks equilibrium points. However, as can be established by
calculating the ﬁxed points of the Poincaré map, the model always displays at least
one, and in most cases three, (stable or unstable) 1-cycles. Under these conditions,
the following deﬁnition of hidden attractor seems to be meaningful.
Deﬁnition 17.1 Consider an impulsive (or switched) system and its corresponding
Poincaré map. An attractor of the system is called hidden if its basin of attraction
does not overlap with small neighborhoods of the ﬁxed points of the Poincaré map.
Thisdeﬁnition(inequivalentterms)hasappearedinRefs. [39, 45, 46]fordifferent
types of hybrid and switched systems of practical interest. A similar deﬁnition was
proposed in Ref.[43] for a non-autonomous system with a periodic external action,
where a stroboscopic discrete-time map was considered.
In this paper, multi-stability and hidden attractors in hybrid models of testos-
terone regulation are studied with special emphasis on situations where the delay
time associated with the response of the testosterone secretion to the hypothalamic
bursts exceeds the typical inter-burst interval in the hypothalamic activity. In the
present model formulation, all the limitations on the time delay value are abolished.
A Poincaré map is derived for a system of impulsive equations with a constant time
delay of any ﬁnite duration.
Numerical analysis of the Poincaré map illustrates how, besides the ﬁxed points of
the map, a signiﬁcant number of other modes arise and undergo a variety of bifurca-
tions, including saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations, subcritical and super-
critical Neimark–Sacker bifurcations, as well as a quasi-periodic period-doubling
bifurcation.

Preliminaries
Let N be the set of integers, N+ the set of nonnegative integers, R the set of real
numbers, Rp the linear space of p-dimensional column vectors with elements from
R, and Rp×q be the linear space of real p × q matrices.
Denote a ﬁnite interval as [a, b] ⊂R. The notation PC ([a, b], Rp) corresponds
to a set of functions σ : [a, b] →Rp that are piecewise continuous and continuous
from the left. In other words, σ(t) is continuous at all points of (a, b) except a ﬁnite
number of discontinuity points t = ˜t, where both left hand and right hand limits
σ(˜t−), σ(˜t+) exist as ﬁnite vectors, and σ(˜t) = σ(˜t−). Moreover, suppose that ﬁnite
σ(a+), σ(b−) exist and σ(b) = σ(b−).
The set PC ([a, +∞), Rp) is deﬁned as the set of functions σ such that σ ∈
PC([a, b], Rp) for every ﬁnite b, b > a.
For a function σ ∈PC, deﬁne the operator Δσ(t) = σ(t+) −σ(t).

FD-Reducible Time Delay Systems
Consider the linear time-invariant autonomous system with a delayed state:
X′ = A0X(t) + A1X(t −τ),
(1)
where ′ = d
dt , X(t) ∈Rp, A0, A1 ∈Rp×p, and τ is a constant time delay. A solution
X(t) to (1) is considered for t ⩾0.
Suppose that X(t) = ϕ(t), −τ ⩽t ⩽0+, where ϕ ∈PC ([−τ, 0], Rp) and ϕ is
extended to some ﬁnite value ϕ(0+).
Deﬁnition 17.2 (References[31, 32]) Time-delay linear system (1) is called ﬁnite-
dimension reducible (FD-reducible) if there exists a constant matrix D ∈Rp×p such
that any solution X(t) of (1) deﬁned for t ⩾0 satisﬁes the ordinary differential
equation
X′ = DX(t)
(2)
for t ⩾τ.
FD-reducibility means that the solutions of time-delay system (1) are indistin-
guishable from those of a ﬁnite-dimensional system of order p on the time interval
[τ, +∞). The theorem below summarizes the essential properties of FD-reducible
systems, see [32] for the proof.
Theorem 17.1 Any of the following statements (i), (ii) is necessary and sufﬁcient
for FD-reducibility of system (1).
(i) The matrix coefﬁcients of (1) satisfy
A1Ak
0A1 = 0 for all k = 0, 1, . . . , p −1.
(3)
(ii) There exists an invertible p × p matrix S such that
S−1A0S =
U 0
W V

,
S−1A1S =
 0 0
¯W 0

,
(4)
where the blocks U, V are square and the sizes of the blocks W and ¯W are equal.
Moreover, the matrix D in the FD-reduced system (2) for the FD-reducible system
(1) is uniquely given by
D = A0 + A1e−A0τ.
(5)
For k = 0, it follows from (3) that the matrix A1 is nilpotent of index 2. While
condition (3) is easy to check, the alternative formulation in (4) provides an important
insight into the structure of FD-reducible systems. This distinctive linear cascade
(chain) structure often appears in biological, chemical, mechanical systems, as well
as process engineering, and is sometimes parametrized in linear systems as input or
output delay in virtue of linearity of the involved blocks.

A Time-Delay Impulsive System: Preliminary Results
Consider an impulsive functional differential system
X′ = A0X(t) + A1X(t −τ) for t ̸= tn,
n ∈N, ΔX(tn)
= λnB,
tn+1 = tn + Tn,
Tn = Φ(CX(tn)),
λn = F(CX(tn)).
(6)
Here, B is a column and C is a row such that CB = 0, to guarantee that CX(t) is
continuous for all t > 0, and τ > 0 is a constant time delay. The continuous functions
Φ(·), F(·) satisfy
0 < Φ1 ⩽Φ(·) ⩽Φ2,
0 < F1 ⩽F(·) ⩽F2,
(7)
for some constants Φi, Fi, i = 1, 2. The latter condition implies that system (6) has
no equilibria.
Further, consider (6) for t ⩾0. Without loss of generality, let t0 = 0, so that the
initial function ϕ ∈PC([−τ, 0], Rp) is extended to t = 0+ as
ϕ(0+) = ϕ(0) + F(Cϕ(0))B.
Thus, X(t) = ϕ(t), −τ ⩽t ⩽0+, and X ∈PC([−τ, +∞), Rp).
The right-hand side of (6) is linear except for the nonlinear functions Φ(·), F(·)
describing impulse effect, and (6) can be termed quasilinear (see also [6]).
Previously, in Refs.[31–33], the case of small time delays, i.e. inf y Φ(y) > τ
was treated. Indeed, the inequality implies that the least distance in between two
consecutive ﬁrings of the pulse-modulated feedback is greater than the time delay
value. This corresponds to the intuitive notion of small-time delay in a sampled-data
system that has to be under the sampling time. Furthermore, in Refs. [36, 38, 39],
the analysis was extended to a less restrictive case of 2 infσ Φ(σ) > τ. The case of
3 infσ Φ(σ) > τ was analyzed in Ref. [48]. In what follows, a general case of an
arbitrary τ demanding further development of the involved mathematical tools is
treated.
Pick a solution (X(t), tn) of hybrid system (6). Consider the ordered sets
T1 = {t0, t1, . . . },
T2 = {t0 + τ, t1 + τ, . . . }.
It follows from (7) that tk+1 −tk ⩾Φ1 > 0 for all k ⩾0, so both sets Ti, i = 1, 2
contain only isolated points.
As mentioned previously, the solution x(t) has jumps at t ∈T1, but is contin-
uous for all t ∈T2\T1. The delayed solution x(t −τ) has jumps at t ∈T2, but is
continuous for all t ∈T1\T2.
For given sequences {tk, λk}|∞
k=0 and t ⩾t0, introduce a function G ∈PC([0, +
∞), Rp):

λkeA0(t−tk)B if tn < t < tn+1
for some n,
and G(0) = 0. Obviously, G obeys ΔG(tn) = λnB for n ∈N. Now, deﬁne another
function R ∈PC([τ, +∞), Rp):
R(t) = G(t) −eA0τ G(t −τ).
The function R(t) has jumps at the points t ∈T1 ∪T2 and is smooth otherwise.
Namely:
• if t ∈T1\T2, then t = tn for some n and ΔR(t) = λnB;
• if t ∈T2\T1, then t = tr + τ for some r and ΔR(t) = −λreA0τB;
• if t ∈T1 ∩T2, then t = tn = tr + τ for some n, r and ΔR(t) = λnB −λreA0τB.
For any n ⩾0, r ⩽n, introduce
Gn

k=n−r λkeA0(t−tk)B if 0 ⩽r ⩽n,

if r < 0.
Lemma 17.1 For the values of t that simultaneously satisfy the inequalities tn <
t < tn+1 and tn−r + τ < t < tn−r+1 + τ with some integers n, r, it holds that
R(t) = Gn
n−r+1(t).
(8)
Proof From the deﬁnition of Gn
r (·)
eA0τ G(t −τ) = Gn−r
0
(t),
tn−r + τ < t < tn−r+1 + τ,
G(t) = Gn

tn < t < tn+1.
Then, since Gn
n−r+1(t) = Gn
0(t) −Gn−r
0
(t), equality (8) is true for tn < t < tn+1 and
tn−r + τ < t < tn−r+1 + τ.
Lemma 17.2 Consider a solution (X(t), tn) of (6). Then the difference z(t) =
X(t) −R(t) satisﬁes the linear equation
z′ = Dz
for all points t > τ, where R(t) is continuous.
Proof In the special coordinate basis given by (4), system (1) can be rewritten as
u′ = Uu,
v′ = Wu + V v + ¯Wu(t −τ)
(9)
with xT = [uT, vT], where ·T denotes transpose. Thus D deﬁned by (5) takes the
form

It is convenient now to assume, without loss of generality, that system (1) is readily
represented in the form of (9). Introduce also the partitioning

(11)
where the dimensions of the vectors B1, B2 correspond to those of u, v, respectively.

and the asterisks stand for arbitrary matrix blocks.
Deﬁne un = u(tn), u+
n = u(t+
n ). Then u+
n = un + λn B1. It is seen from (9) that
u(t) = eU(t−t0)u0 +


k=0
λkeU(t−tk)B1 = eU(t−t0)u0 + Sn

when tn−r < t −τ < tn−r+1.
Suppose that t simultaneously satisﬁes tn < t < tn+1 and tn−r < t −τ < tn−r+1
with some n, r, 0 ⩽r ⩽n. Then, from (13) and (14), it is concluded that
u(t) −eUτu(t −τ) = Sn
n−r+1(t).
(15)
As it was shown in [36],
X′ = DX(t) −(D −A0)η(t),
(16)
with
η(t) =

where ∗stands for any vector of a suitable size. Taking into account (12), (15), by a
speciﬁc choice of the vector denoted as ∗, (16) can be rewritten as

406
A. N. Churilov et al.
X′ = DX(t) −(D −A0)Gn
r+1(t).
(17)
From Lemma 17.1 and (17) the statement of Lemma 17.2 becomes evident.
The result obtained above plays a crucial role in the subsequent considerations.
Introduce the notation: ¯Xn = X(tn). In particular, Lemma 17.2 implies that given
the discrete time sequence ( ¯Xk, tk)
		∞
k=0, the state vector X(t) can be uniquely recon-
structed at any point t > τ. However, in the time interval [0, τ], the knowledge of
the discrete time dynamics is insufﬁcient: to calculate the inter-impulse behavior, the
initial function ϕ(t), −τ ⩽t ⩽0 is also needed.

Poincaré Map of a Time-Delay Impulsive System
For any pair of integers (r, s) such that 0 ⩽r ⩽s, deﬁne a set
Ωr,s = { (X, t) ∈Rp × R : tr ⩽t −τ < tr+1, ts < t −τ + Φ(CX) ⩽ts+1 }.
Lemma 17.3 Consider a pair ( ¯Xn, tn) with tn ⩾τ. Then, there exist integers r, s
such that 1 ⩽r ⩽n, 0 ⩽s ⩽r, and ( ¯Xn, tn) ∈Ωn−r,n−s.
Proof With t0 = 0, it can be concluded that there exist integers r, s such that
tn−r ⩽tn −τ < tn−r+1,
(18)
tn−s < tn+1 −τ ⩽tn−s+1.
(19)
Due to tn+1 = tn + Φ(C ¯Xn), it is true that ( ¯Xn, tn) ∈Ωn−r,n−s. From (18), (19), it
follows that tn−r < tn, tn−s < tn+1 and tn−r < tn−s+1, so the statement of the lemma
becomes evident.
Inequalities (18), (19) in Lemma 17.3 imply that the interval (tn, tn+1) contains
exactly r −s points of the set T2.
For any integer r, s, 0 ⩽r ⩽s, introduce a vector-valued function

Theorem 17.2 Consider an integer n such that tn ⩾τ and deﬁne the integers r, s,

Proof Apply Lemma 17.2. In the interval (tn, tn+1), the function z(t) = X(t) −R(t)
has exactly r −s jumps:
Δz(tk + τ) = λkeA0τB,
k = n −r + 1, . . . , n −s.
Then
z(tn+1) = eDTnz(t+

where δn−r,n−s is deﬁned by
δn−r,n−s =

Since X(tn+1) = ¯Xn+1, X(t+

(25)
Since δn−r,n−s = δn−r,n −δn−s,n, it can be easily shown that
βn
n−r = e−DTnδn−r,n −Gn
n−r+1(tn),
γ n
n−s = δn−s,n −Gn

so (23) follows from (25).
The result below facilitates the computation of the right-hand side of (23).

Poincaré maps with memory constitute an established tool for studying time-
delay systems given by differential-difference equations. Periodic solutions of such
a system correspond to ﬁxed points of the map. Discrete maps with memory are even
more useful in analysis of hybrid time-delay systems as iterating a map is easier and
numerically more sound compared to direct solution of the system equations [35]. It
worth recalling here that techniques based on analysis of equilibria are not applicable
to system (6) as it lacks such.
Corollary 17.1 The Poincaré map with memory
Q :

¯Xk
		n
k=n−rn , tn

→¯Xn+1,
(27)
is given by (23), where the integer r = rn, 1 ⩽r ⩽n, satisﬁes the inequalities
n−1

i=n−r
Φ(C ¯Xi) ⩾τ,
n−1

i=n−r+1
Φ(C ¯Xi) < τ.
(28)
Here, for the case r = 1, it is assumed
n−1

i=n
Φ(C ¯Xi) = 0.
(29)
Moreover, the numerical value of the vector ¯Xn−r is not required in Q, as only
existence of a solution to (28) has to be guaranteed.
Proof The right-hand side of (23) depends on the values
λi, i = n −r + 1, . . . , n,
t j, j = n −r + 1, . . . , n + 1
(30)
produced by the feedback modulation laws. Given ¯Xn−r+1, . . . , ¯Xn and tn, the
weights and times in (30) can be calculated from (6) as
λi = F(C ¯Xi),
i = n −r + 1, . . . , n,
t j = t j+1 −Φ(C ¯X j),
j = n −r + 1, . . . , n −1.
Since
tn −tn−k =
n−1

i=n−k
Ti =
n−1

i=n−k
Φ(C ¯Xi),
(1 ⩽k ⩽n),
inequalities (18) can be rewritten as (28).

Similarly, (19) can be put as
n

i=n−s
Φ(C ¯Xi) > τ,
n

i=n−s+1
Φ(C ¯Xi) ⩽τ,
(31)
where s ⩽r.
Closed-form expressions for map (27) specialized to certain values of r can be
found in Refs.[33, 36, 37].
Summing up, to calculate ¯Xn+1, r previous points ¯Xn−r+1, . . . , ¯Xn are needed,
where the value of r depends on n (r = rn) and is determined from (28). The number
r can be interpreted as a (discrete) memory span required to determine the value of
¯Xn+1 at the next step. Obviously, the actual memory span can vary with n, see (27).
Corollary 17.2 Assume that
m inf
σ Φ(σ) > τ
(32)
for some integer m, m ⩾1. (Alternatively, mΦ1 > τ, where Φ1 is deﬁned from (7).)
Then, 1 ⩽r ⩽m in (27), so that the Poincaré map in (27) acts as
Q :

¯Xk
		n
k=n−m+1 , tn

→¯Xn+1,
(33)
i.e. to ﬁnd ¯Xn+1 it sufﬁces to know at most m previous points ¯Xn−m+1, . . . , ¯Xn,
n ⩾m −1.
Proof From (32), one has
n−1

i=n−m
Φ(C ¯Xi) > τ
for any n ⩾m. Then, it follows from (29) that inequalities (28) are satisﬁed for some
1 ⩽r ⩽m.
Thus, in case (32) holds, the memory span at every step does not exceed m [i.e.,
r ⩽m in (28)]. The integer s can be estimated in a similar manner. Finally, if (28),
(31) are satisﬁed then
1 ⩽r ⩽m,
0 ⩽s ⩽m −1,
s ⩽r.
(34)
It can be easily established that there exist q = 1
2m(m + 3) −1 different values for
integer pairs (r, s) satisfying (34). Notice that the integer m(m + 3) is always even.
Consider the following practically important special cases.
(i) Let m = 1 (see Refs.[31, 32]). Then, to ﬁnd ¯Xn+1, it is sufﬁcient to know only
the point ¯Xn. Thus q = 1 and the only possible (r, s) satisfying (34) are r = 1,
s = 0.

410
A. N. Churilov et al.
(ii) Let m = 2 (see Refs.[36–38]). Then, to ﬁnd ¯Xn+1, at most two previous points
¯Xn−1, ¯Xn are needed. Thus q = 4 and there are four possible cases: r = 1, s = 0;
r = 1, s = 1; r = 2, s = 0; r = 2, s = 1.
With the increase of the maximal memory length m, the number of the domains
Ωn−r,n−s may grow signiﬁcantly. For instance, for m = 10, q = 64 different domains
exist. Yet, for computational purposes, the corresponding formulae can be obtained
rather simply by means of the recurrent relationships in (26).
Making use of the bounds in (7) for the function Φ(y), closer estimates for r,
s can be obtained. For example, from (18), (19), it follows that tn < tn−r+1 + τ <
tn−s + τ < tn+1, and so tn−s −tn−r+1 < tn+1 −tn. Hence, (r −s −1)Φ1 < Φ2 and
r < s + Φ2/Φ1 + 1. In particular, if Φ1 = Φ2 (no frequency modulation), then either
s = r, or s = r −1.
The following important property of the map Q is implied by Remark 17.1.
Theorem 17.3 The map deﬁned by (23) is continuous in its domain of deﬁnition.
Proof Obviously, the map (23) is piecewise continuous and may have gaps only on
the boundaries of the sets Ωn−r,n−s, i.e., when either t = tn−r + τ holds for some r,
or t + Φ(CX) = tn−s + τ for some s. Considering t = tn and X = ¯Xn, this results
in either tn = tn−r + τ or tn+1 = tn−s + τ.
From Remark 17.1, it follows that
βn
n−r −βn
n−r−1
		
tn=tn−r+τ = 0,
γ n
n−s −γ n
n−s−1
		
tn+1=tn−s+τ = 0.
This implies continuity.
Consider for illustration some simple special cases. From Remark 17.1, one has
βn
n−1 = λn

e−Dτ −e−A0τ
eA0τB,
γ n
n−1 = λn

eD(Tn−τ) −eA0(Tn−τ)
eA0τB.
Thus, as straightforwardly calculated in Ref.[36], for r = s = 1, it holds that
¯xn+1 = αn + eDTnβn
n−1 −γ n
n−1 = eDTn ¯xn + λneA0TnB;
and, for r = 1, s = 0, the state vector of the continuous part satisﬁes
¯xn+1 = αn + eDTnβn
n−1 −γ n
n = eDTn ¯xn + λneD(Tn−τ)eA0τB.
As it was mentioned previously, the discrete-time representation given by (23)
entirely deﬁnes the dynamics of the impulsive continuous time system in (6) for
t > τ. Therefore, to investigate asymptotical behaviors of (6), it sufﬁces to study
discrete map (23) and its iterations. Some examples of such an analysis can be found
in the next sections and in Refs.[37, 38].

Time-Delay Impulsive Model of Testosterone Regulation
In this section, the theoretical tools developed above are applied to a delayed system
withimpulsivefeedbackthat originates frommathematical modelingof thenon-basal
testosterone regulation in the human male [19, 24–28].
In what follows, only the dominating delay due to the transport from pituitary,
where LH (luteinizing hormone) is secreted, to testes, where Te (testosterone) is pro-
duced, is considered. The impulsive feedback is implemented via episodic secretion
of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) in response to the concentration of Te.
The delay value τ takes into account not only the transport of LH from pituitary to
testes, but also an additional time required for steroid synthesis in the testes [24].
Since this delay substantially exceeds the other delays in this endocrine axis, the
latter ones can be neglected.
Consider a specialization of system (6) with
x′ = −b1x,
y′ = −b2y + g1x,
z′ = −b3z + g2y(t −τ),
t0 = 0,
tn+1 = tn + Tn,
Δx(tn) = λn,
Tn = Φ(z(tn)),
λn = F(z(tn)),
(35)
where b1, b2, b3, g1, g2 are positive parameters reﬂecting the kinetics of the involved
hormones that also imply bi ̸= b j for i ̸= j.
In biology, Hill functions [49] are habitually used to approximate monotonous
nonlinearities and can be applied to capture the shape of F(·), Φ(·)

F(z) = k3 +

1 + (z/h)ν ,
with some positive parameters k1, k2, k3, k4, h, ν. System (35) is subject to the initial
conditions x(0−) = x0, y(t) = ϕ2(t) with −τ ⩽t ⩽0, z(0) = z0. Here, x(0+) =
x(0−) + Φ(z0), ϕ2(t) is a continuous initial function.

choice of initial values for map (23).

Proof Inequalities (36) imply tm0−1 ⩽τ < tm0. One has
z′ = −b3z(t) + g2ϕ2(t −τ),
0 ⩽t ⩽τ.
(38)
Let ξ(t) be any continuously differentiable function deﬁned for 0 ⩽t ⩽τ. Since

−τ ⩽t ⩽0,
yields the solution to (38) z(t) ≡ξ(t), 0 ⩽t ⩽τ. In particular, ξ(t) can be chosen
in such a way that ϕ2(0) = y0, ξ(ti) = zi, i = 0, 1, . . . , m0 −1, and, moreover, ξ(τ)
can be assigned to any desired value.

(39)
In particular, (37) is valid for t = t−

z′ = −b3z(t) + g2y(t −τ),
τ ⩽t ⩽tm0,
where y(t) is obtained from (39) and, as it was mentioned previously, z(τ) can be
assigned arbitrarily by the choice of ϕ2(t). Then, an arbitrary value zm0 to z(t−
m0) can
be assigned by the choice of z(τ).
The proof is complete.
Remark 17.2 Proposition 17.1 can be extended to the general system expressed
by (9). Then, the assumption of g2 ̸= 0 has to be replaced by controllability of the
matrix pair (V, ¯W).

In what follows, the discrete map given by (23) was applied to the analysis of non-
linear behaviors in (35) for sufﬁciently large values of time delay. On this way,
new dynamical phenomena were discovered that had not so far been observed in
the system in hand [37, 39]. The previously studied effects of multi-stability and
quasi-periodicity are brieﬂy illustrated below to provide a reference for comparison
with further presented new results. Primarily, periodic solutions of (35) with exactly
m jumps in the least period are considered. Their corresponding orbits are usually
termed m-cycles. Parameters of m-cycles can be calculated from the ﬁxed points of
mth iterations of the Poincaré map.
In the oncoming analysis, the time delay τ (0 < τ < 205.0) and b1 are used as
bifurcation parameters. The remaining model parameters are kept constant: b2 =
0.15, b3 = 0.2, k1 = 60.0, k2 = 40.0, k3 = 3.0, k4 = 2.0, g1 = 2.0, g2 = 0.5, h =
2.7 and ν = 2.
In order to obtain a more complete picture of the set of attracting states and
the bifurcations they undergo, a careful numerical investigation of the map (23)
was performed. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the bifurcation structure that can
be observed in the dynamics of the system (23). In order to distinguish between
branches of the bifurcation diagram, the notation Bm,i is used, where m denotes the
periodicity of the cycle, from which the branch stars and i numbers different cycles
with the same m.
Depending on the time delay τ, a variety of different scenarios (Fig. 1) is observed.
(i) If τ < Tn, map (23) can display a ﬁnite or inﬁnite period doubling cascade. An
example of such transition is shown in Fig. 1. One can see that when the time
delay τ decreases (see the branch B1,1), 1-cycle undergoes a period-doubling
bifurcation at the point τ = τd, leading to the appearance of a stable 2-cycle.
Here the dashed line represents an unstable 1-cycle.
(ii) If the values of the time delay parameter τ are chosen such that τ < Tn + Tn−1,
more complex bifurcation phenomena are possible. In particular (see Fig. 1),
as the parameter τ decreases, the stable 1-cycle belonging to the branch B1,2
undergoes a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation. As a result, a closed invariant curve
corresponding to the quasi-periodic dynamics softly appears and the 1-cycle
becomes an unstable focus. As shown in a recent publication [37], in the region
of overlap between two branches B1,1 and B1,2, the system displays quasiperi-
odic dynamics, border collisions, multi-stability, overlapping resonance tongues
of different periodicity, hidden attractors [42, 50], as well as period-doubling
cascades and deterministic chaos.
(iii) Ifτ < Tn + Tn−1 + Tn−2,asillustratedinFig.1,thebifurcationdiagramcontains
three branches B1,1, B1,2 and B1,3. Around the region of overlap between the
branches B1,2 and B1,3, the bifurcation pattern is qualitatively similar to the
previous case τ < Tn + Tn−1. A difference is that the system demonstrates a
quasiperiodic period-doubling and a subcritical Neimark–Sacker bifurcation,

Fig. 1 A sketch illustrating the bifurcation structure for 0 < τ < Tn + Tn−1 + Tn−2. If τ < Tn the
bifurcation diagram contains a single branch B1,1. When decreasing the time delay τ, the 1-cycle
undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation at the point τd. If τ < Tn + Tn−1 the bifurcation diagram
contains two branches B1,1 and B1,2. As the parameter τ decreases the stable 1-cycle belonging
to the branch B1,2 undergoes a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation at τϕ, leading to the birth of a stable
closed invariant curve. If τ < Tn + Tn−1 + Tn−2, the bifurcation diagram contains three branches
B1,1, B1,2 and B1,3. These branches arise in a saddle-node bifurcation. Here BU
1,1, BU
1,2 are the
unstable branches, corresponding to the saddle 1-cycles, and τ u∗
0 , τ u
0 , τ ∗
0 and τ0 are the saddle-
node bifurcation points. τ L
ϕ and τ R
ϕ are the Neimark–Sacker bifurcation points for the branch B1,3.
Numbers 1 and 2 denote regions to be examined in what follows
leading to appearance of two closed invariant curves, one attracting and one
repelling. These phenomena have not been investigated so far in the dynamics
of time-delay impulsive model (35).
The bifurcation behavior for τ < Tn + Tn−1 is analyzed below in more detail
in order to illustrate the mechanisms of formation of the coexisting attractors (see
Fig. 1). Fig. 2a displays the bifurcation diagram for the case τ < Tn + Tn−1 and
b1 = 0.048.
The branches B1,1 and B1,2 start from the 1-cycles arising via saddle-node bifur-
cation. The dashed lines in Fig. 2 represent the unstable 1-cycles. The branch BU
1,1
denotes the saddle 1-cycle. As the time delay τ decreases, the system enters the
region of multi-stability through the saddle-node bifurcation point τ ∗
0 . On the part
of this region that falls between the points τ ∗
0 and τϕ, the stable node 1-cycle (B1,1)
coexists with the stable focus 1-cycle (B1,2 ). The two-dimensional projection of the
phase portrait in Fig. 2b depicts the coexistent stable focus 1-cycle F1 (B1,2) and
stable node 1-cycle N1 (B1,1) for τ = 94.36 and b1 = 0.048. Here W U
± are the unsta-
ble manifolds of the saddle 1-cycle S1. The stable manifold of the saddle 1-cycle S1
(BU
1,2) separates the basins of attraction of the coexisting stable 1-cycles F1 and N1.
Figure 2c presents a magniﬁed part of the bifurcation diagram outlined by rectan-
gle in Fig. 2a and shows the transition from a stable 1-cycle F1 to the quasiperiodic
dynamics. As the time delay τ is further decreased, the stable focus 1-cycle F1
becomes an unstable focus in a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation at the point τ = τϕ

Numerical experiments show that the basin of attraction for the stable closed
invariant curve C overlaps with the neighborhoods of the unstable focus F1 or saddle
S1 1-cycles. Recall that the orbits of map (23) are sequences of points. If the initial
point is chosen close to the saddle 1- cycle S1 (for example on the unstable manifold
W U
+ of S1 close to this cycle), then the system asymptotically converges to the stable
closed invariant curve C1 (see Fig. 2d). Hence, the stable closed invariant curve C1
cannot be referred to as a hidden attractor. This scenario and other forms of multi-
stability were described in more detail in Refs.[37, 39].

Bifurcation Analysis: Crater Bifurcation Scenario and
Hidden Attractors
In this section, a number of new bifurcation phenomena that has not previously
been revealed in the delay impulsive equations are examined. As mentioned above,
operating in a region of large time delays leads to the more complex nonlinear
phenomena that do not occur in the case τ < Tn + Tn−1. The aim of this part is to
exemplify such behaviors.
Figure 3a–d display the results of a bifurcation analysis for the slightly higher val-
ues of the time delay τ < Tn + Tn−1 + Tn−2 and b1 = 0.048, wherein the bifurcation
pattern is qualitatively similar to what is depicted in Fig. 2a. However, the nature of
the quasiperiodic motion has certain peculiarities in comparison with Fig. 2a and c.
The bifurcation diagram in Fig. 3a contains three branches B1,2, B1,3 and BU
1,2. The
branch B1,3 begins and ends at the saddle-node bifurcation points and BU
1,2 presents
a saddle 1-cycle, arising at the point τ0.

Complex Dynamics and Hidden Attractors in Delayed Impulsive Systems
419
A magniﬁed part of the bifurcation diagram, outlined by the rectangle in Fig. 3a,
is shown in Figs. 3b and c is the magniﬁcation of part of Fig. 3b. As the parame-
ter τ decreases, the stable focus 1-cycle belonging to the branch B1,3 undergoes a
Neimark–Sacker bifurcation at the point τ R
ϕ (Fig. 3c and d). As a result, a stable closed
invariant curve softly appears from the stable focus 1-cycle. After this bifurcation,
the 1-cycle becomes an unstable focus. With further decrease of the value of τ, the
unstable focus 1-cycle is doubled via a period-doubling bifurcation transverse to the
stable closed invariant curve at the point τd (Fig. 3c). This leads to the appearance of
the unstable focus 2-cycle. The unstable 1-cycle after the transverse period-doubling
bifurcation is denoted by 1 in Figs. 3b and c. As the time delay parameter τ passes
the value τ L
ϕ , the unstable focus 2-cycle becomes stable.
In the part of the bifurcation in Figs. 3b and c that falls to the left of the point
τ L
ϕ , the interval τ1 < τ < τ L
ϕ is observed, where the stable 2-cycle (denoted by 2)

coexists with the stable 1-cycle belonging to the branch B1,2. As illustrated in Fig.3b,
a pair of 2-cycles (a stable one marked as 2 and a saddle cycle marked by 3) appear in
a saddle-node bifurcation at the point τ1. When the parameter τ increases, a saddle 2-
cycle undergoes a reverse period-doubling bifurcation at the point τ3 that produces the
saddle 1-cycle, associated with the branch BU
1,2. Returning to Figs. 3b and c, to follow
the course of the unstable 1-cycle (denoted by 1) produced in the period-doubling
bifurcation at the point τd, one notes that the cycle initially continues to the left in
the bifurcation diagram until it reaches τ2 where it disappears in the saddle-node
bifurcation.
Finally, if the time delay τ is increased over the value τ1, the stable focus 2-cycle
F2 is destabilized via a subcritical Neimark–Sacker bifurcation at the point τ L
ϕ (see
Fig. 3d). Arrows in Fig. 3d denote scanning directions. Consider the characteristics
of the subcritical Neimark–Sacker bifurcation shown in Fig. 3d in more detail in
order to understand the mechanism of this transition.
A sequence of typical phase portraits illustrating the main stages of the transition
from a stable 2-cycle to quasi-periodic oscillations through a subcritical Neimark–
Sacker bifurcation is shown in Figs. 4 and 5.
Figure 4a shows the phase portrait of the map for the interval τF < τ < ϕL in
Fig. 3d. Here, a pair of closed invariant curves, one attracting C1 and one repelling
CU
2 , coexist with the stable focus 2-cycle F2 and stable 1-cycle (B1,2 in Fig. 3a. The
stable manifold of the saddle closed curve CU
2 separates the basins of attraction of
the coexisting stable focus 2-cycle F2 and stable closed curve C1. To simplify the
analysis, Figs. 4b and c show separately the stable C1 and saddle CU
2 closed invariant
curves, and the stable 2-cycle F2 and repelling closed curve CU
2 , respectively.
Detailing of the bifurcational transition in Fig. 3c and d reveals that the basin
of attraction for the 2-cycle F2 within the interval τ L
ϕ < τ < τd (see Fig. 3c and d)
does not overlap with small neighborhoods of the unstable ﬁxed point SF and of
the saddle ﬁxed point, which belongs to the branch BU
1,2 in Fig. 3. Hence, the stable
2-cycle F2 can be attributed to a hidden attractor.
Figures 5a–d illustrate the transformations of the phase portrait in the subcritical
Neimark–Sacker bifurcation. As the time delay τ increases, the repelling closed
curve CU
2 decreases in size (Fig. 5a). Near the Neimark–Sacker bifurcation point τ L
ϕ ,
the basin of attraction for the stable 2-cycle F2 can be arbitrarily small. In this case,
even weak perturbations, such as truncation errors in the computer simulation, can
lead to a non-monotonic behavior and a sudden transition from the stable 2-cycle F2
to the attracting closed invariant curve C1 can be expected.
With further increase of τ, the repelling closed curve CU
2 merges with the focus
2-cycle F2 at the bifurcation point τ L
ϕ , and the stable 2-cycle F2 becomes unsta-
ble (Fig. 5b). When crossing the bifurcation point τ L
ϕ with increasing τ, the system
displays an abrupt transition from the stable 2-cycle to a quasi-periodic attractor.
This scenario may be considered as a modiﬁcation of the so-called “crater bifurca-
tion” [51, 52].

cation point τ L

Bifurcation Analysis: Quasi-Periodic Period-Doubling
By making use of the discrete map of Theorem 17.2, one more example of complex
dynamical behavior that is inherent in the “large delay” case is presented below.
Figure 6 depicts the results of the bifurcation analysis for b1 = 0.055. Figures 6a
and b exhibit a picture qualitatively similar to the case with b1 = 0.048 (see Figs. 3a
and b). But, unlike the previous case, the stable 2-cycle undergoes two period-
doubling bifurcations: direct at the point τ4 and reverse one at the point τ5 (see
Fig. 6b). Moreover, as the parameter b1 increases from the value b1 = 0.048, the
subcritical Neimark–Sacker bifurcation for the 2-cycle transforms into the supercrit-
ical type, and the region of quasi-periodic dynamics moves from the inside to the
outside of the region of multi-stability (see Figs. 3a and 6a).
Figure 6b illustrates the transitions from 1- and 2-cycles to quasi-periodic dynam-
ics. As the time delay τ increases, the stable 2-cycle undergoes a supercritical
Neimark–Sacker bifurcation at the point τ L
ϕ giving birth to a stable period-2 closed

invariant curve. Analogously, the stable 1-cycle is destabilized through a supercriti-
cal Neimark–Sacker bifurcation at the point τ R
ϕ , leading to the appearance of a stable
period-1 closed invariant curve. The diagram in the lower panel of Fig. 6b illustrates
how a pair of complex-conjugated multipliers for the 1-cycle leave unit circle at a
point τ R
ϕ .
Examine now how a stable period-1 closed invariant curve is transformed into a
stable period-2 closed curve. A sequence of typical phase portraits illustrating the
main stages of this transition is shown in Fig. 7 (see also Fig. 6c).
At the starting point, the system displays an attracting period-1 closed invariant
curve C1 (Fig. 7a). As the value of parameter τ is decreased, the unstable focus 1-
cycle F1 undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation transverse the stable closed curve
C1 as one of the real multipliers ρ5 leaves the unit circle through −1 at τd (see Fig. 6c)
and the unstable period-2 cycle F2 softly arises (Fig. 7b). The original unstable focus
1-cycle turns into the repelling focus 1-cycle SF. This is illustrated in Fig. 7a and b.
The stable period-1 closed curve C1 continues to exist after this bifurcation (Fig. 7c).

424
A. N. Churilov et al.
When crossing the next bifurcation point τ C
ϕ (Fig. 6c) with decreasing τ, the sta-
ble period-1 closed curve C1 undergoes a so-called quasi-periodic period-doubling
bifurcation. As one can see from Fig. 7c, this leads to the soft appearance of an
attracting period-2 closed curve C2 around the unstable focus 2-cycle F2 and the
period-1 closes curve C1 becomes repelling (saddle) CU
1 . Fig. 7d presents the phase
portrait for the fully developed period-2 closed curve C2.
With further reduction of the parameter τ, the unstable period-2 cycle F2 under-
goes a reverse supercritical Neimark–Sacker bifurcation at the point τ L
ϕ . As a result,
a stable period-2 closed invariant curve C2 softly transforms into the stable focus
2-cycle F2. Fig. 8 presents an overview of this scenario. Before the bifurcation, in
Figs. 8a–c, a stable closed curve C2, surrounding the periodic points of the unstable
focus 2-cycle F2, coexists with the repelling closed curve CU
1 and unstable 1-cycle
SF. As the parameter τ decreased, the attraction closed curve C2 decreases in size
(see Fig. 8d) and merges with the unstable 2-cycle F2 at the point τ L
ϕ , and the 2-cycle
F2 becomesstablefocus.Figure8eshowsthephaseportraitaftertheNeimark–Sacker
bifurcation.
Finally, the stable 2-cycle F2 undergoes two period-doubling bifurcations, ﬁrst
a direct bifurcation (at τ5), and then a reverse one (at τ4). Hereafter, the stable 2-
cycle merges with the saddle 2-cycle (BU
1,1) and disappears at τ1 in a saddle-node
bifurcation (see Fig. 6b).
Moreover, in the region of multi-stability, the basins of attractions for the stable 2-
or 4-cycles do not include the neighborhoods of the unstable 1-cycles (see Fig. 6b).

Conclusions
A speciﬁc class of delay impulsive equations with an arbitrary but ﬁnite value of the
delay is considered. The previously proposed approach of reducing the analysis of
an impulsive time-delay system to that of a discrete-time system is revisited and any
restrictions on the duration of the time delay are removed. The hybrid dynamics are
shown to be captured by a discrete impulse-to-impulse Poincaré map with memory
that is proved to be instrumental in the analysis of complex nonlinear phenomena
exhibited by the model.
Facilitated by the obtained discrete map, a detailed numerical bifurcation analysis
of the system dynamics with respect to the time delay value reveals new complex
nonlinear dynamics phenomena in the delay impulsive system, inherent to the case
of large delay.
As an example of the complex dynamical structures that one can encounter,
for slightly higher values of the time delay τ < Tn + Tn−1 + Tn−2, a structure is
described, in which a pair of closed invariant curves, one attracting and one repelling,
coexist with a stable focus 2-cycle. The stable manifold of the repelling closed curve
separates the basins of attraction of the coexisting stable motions.

Complex Dynamics and Hidden Attractors in Delayed Impulsive Systems
425
Under this condition, the stable focus 2-cycle qualiﬁes as a hidden attractor since
the basin of attraction for this stable motion does not intersect with small neighbor-
hoods of the unstable focus or saddle 1-cycles.
As the time delay is increased, the repelling one decreases in size and merges
with the stable focus 2-cycle at the subcritical Neimark–Sacker bifurcation point.
This bifurcation leads to an abrupt transition from a stable 2-cycle to a stable closed
invariant curve, associated with the quasi-periodic dynamics.
As another example, a bifurcation scenario is presented, in which a stable period-
1 closed invariant curve undergoes a quasi-periodic period-doubling bifurcation,
leading to the appearance of the attracting period-2 and repelling period-1 closed
curves.

Introduction
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and deterministic chaos, which is a complex behavior
produced by complex as well as simple dynamical systems, are tightly joined to
create an interdisciplinary fusion of two interesting areas. This chapter discusses
the use of EAs for numerical identiﬁcation of the existence of the so-called hidden
attractors (a full report is in [1]), which are part of the chaotic dynamics, as well
as their synthesis [2, 3]. To understand this very speciﬁc topic, it is important to
brieﬂy explain the signiﬁcance of hidden attractors for industrial technologies and
also for the dynamics of evolutionary algorithms, as well as previous usages of EAs
for chaotic dynamics control, identiﬁcation and synthesis. In this section, we provide
an overview, consequently of a) hidden attractors, b) EAs used for chaotic dynamics,
and c) existence of chaos inside EAs and its impact on EAs performance, including
its control.
Hidden attractors (see Fig. 4) constitute a special set of points that reﬂect the
dynamics of the observed system, as reported in [4, 5]. In general and from a compu-
tational point of view, attractors can be regarded as self-excited or hidden attractors.
Self-excited attractors can be localized numerically by a standard computational
procedure, in which after a transient process a trajectory, starting from a point of
unstable manifold in a neighborhood of an equilibrium, reaches a state of equilib-
rium or oscillation; therefore, one can easily identify it. In contrast, for a hidden
attractor, the basin of attraction does not intersect with any small neighborhoods
of the equilibriums. Normally, standard basins of attraction are solid part-sets that
represent initial conditions, which lead a trajectory to the attractor, as demonstrated

Fig. 1 A typical example of
basin of attraction for the
Burger system, see Eq. 1
in Fig. 1 and Eq. (1), or Fig. 2 and Eq. (2), while the basin of attraction of a hidden
attractor can be quite tiny, see Fig. 6.
A hidden attractor can be a chaotic or a periodic solution—e.g. the case of coex-
istence of a single stationary point that is stable and a stable limit cycle (e.g., in the
counterexamples to the Kalman and Aizerman conjecture) [4, 5]. On the contrary,
classical attractors are self-excited attractors and, therefore, can be obtained and
identiﬁed numerically by a standard computational procedure such as that for the
Lorenz system. One can easily predict the existence of a self-excited attractor, while
for a hidden attractor the main problem is how to predict its existence in the phase
space. Thus, for localization of hidden attractors, it is important to develop special
procedures, since there are no similar transient processes leading to such attractors.
Few novel methods have been developed recently, for instance in [6, 7].
xn+1 = Axn −y2
n
yn+1 = Byn + xnyn
(1)
and
xn+1 = x2
n −y2
n + Axn + Byn
yn+1 = 2xnyn + Cxn + Dyn
(2)
If a hidden attractor is present in the system dynamics and if it is coincidentally
reached, then a device (an airplane, el. circuit, etc.) starts to show quasi-cyclic behav-
iors that, depending on the kind of device, can cause real disasters. As an example,

basin of attraction for the
Burger system, see Eq. 2
we can use Gripen jet ﬁghter crash1 or F-22 raptor crash landing2 caused by com-
puter malfunction that led to oscillations (also called wind-up in control theory).
Remember that even a computer is an electronic device containing nonlinear parts
that can generate chaotic behaviors (e.g., Chua’s circuit). Hidden attractors, as a part
of deterministic chaos, can be studied [4, 5] just like the deterministic chaos itself,
for example see [8–10]. The latest research papers, which discussed hidden attractor
topics, are a very good source of information [11, 12]. In those papers, there are
discussed topics like controlling hidden attractors [13] and/or its theoretical back-
grounds, for example, in [6, 14–16] and [7].
In the last 15 years, it was demonstrated that evolutionary algorithms can be
used successfully for deterministic chaos systems control, its identiﬁcation and/or
synthesis. Deterministic chaos control, see [10] (this handbook can serve as a very
good reference to that topic and related areas), while control law synthesis is another
area of EA applications. The control of chaotic systems has been an active area of
research during the past decade. Numerous papers focusing on chaos control with
EAs have been published. As an example, we can mention paper [17], where the basic
ideas about chaos control, or about CML systems control, are presented. One usually
expects some preliminary information to derive control law (for classical controllers).
One of the ﬁrst and important initial studies of EAs for control (including CML
systems control) was reported in [18, 19] and [20], where the control law was based
on the Pyragas method: Extended delay feedback control–ETDAS [21]. Other papers
focus on the tuning of several parameters inside the control laws for a chaotic system.

Some research in this ﬁeld has recently been done using EAs for optimization of local
control of chaos based on a Lyapunov-theoretic approach [22, 23]. EA searched for
optimal setting of adjustable parameters of a control method to reach the desired
state or behavior of the chaotic system.
Other applications of unconventional control of chaotic systems by EAs are
described in [2] and [24–26], where EA synthesis of control laws for discrete chaotic
systems is discussed. Compared to that, papers [24–26] show the possibility and
how to generate a whole control law (not only to optimize several parameters) in
order to stabilize a chaotic system. The synthesis of control is inspired by the Pyra-
gas delayed feedback control technique [27, 28]. Unlike the original OGY control
method [17], it can be simply considered as a targeting and stabilizing algorithm
together in one package. Another big advantage of the Pyragas method is the small
number of accessible control parameters. Methods used in generating new chaotic
systems from physical systems or from “manipulations” (e.g., control and parameter
estimation) [10, 29] are based on classical mathematical analysis. Along with these
classical methods, EAs are also applicable to chaotic system synthesis, as reported
in [30, 31], which introduced chaos synthesis by means of a novel EA method. This
method is similar to genetic programming or/and grammatical evolution. As shown
in [30, 31], such an approach is able to synthesize new and “simple” chaotic systems
based on some elements contained in a pre-chosen existing chaotic system and a
properly deﬁned cost function. The most signiﬁcant results are carefully selected,
visualized and reported in [31].
Chaos control or synthesis is not only a ﬁeld for research, but also a research
demonstration that chaos can also be observed inside evolutionary dynamics [31,
32], which posts a lot of questions that we will discuss below.
Chaotic systems were also used as pseudorandom number generators, like the
logistic map [33], which is not the only example to use the logistic map. Another
paper [34] discusses the use of the logistic map as a chaos-based true random num-
ber generator embedded in reconﬁgurable switched-capacitor hardware. Xing in [35]
proposed an algorithm of generating a pseudorandom number generator and com-
bined the coupled map lattice [10] via chaotic iterations. The authors also tested the
algorithm in NIST 800-22 statistical test suits for its applicability in image encryp-
tion. In[36], theauthors investigatedinterestingproperties of chaoticsystems inorder
to design a random bit generator (called CCCBG), in which two chaotic systems are
cross-coupled with each other. For evaluation of the bit streams generated by the
CCCBG, four basic tests are performed: monobit test, serial test, auto-correlation,
and Poker test. Also, the most stringent tests of randomness: the NIST suite tests,
have been used.
Several studies already dealt with the possibilities of integrating chaotic systems
into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the performances of such
algorithms, see [37, 38]. Papers [39, 40] extend the experiments of [38] and investi-
gate the impact of using different chaotic maps on the behavior of the PSO algorithm,
especially in terms of convergence speed and premature convergence risk. Three dif-
ferent chaotic systems (maps) are used and their impacts are compared in this study,

Fig. 3 A typical example of cost function surface from experiments based on EAs and chaos
synchronization in [31]. The surface typically exhibits a lot of local extremes and is in general very
complex
aiming to ﬁnd a link between a speciﬁc chaotic system and a speciﬁc behavior of the
PSO algorithm.
The above-mentioned information and references are only a fraction of existing
research papers that discuss mutual fusion of EAs and chaotic dynamics. This chapter
discusses the possibility on EA identiﬁcation of hidden attractor existence and its
synthesis, because, as stated in many papers and books (e.g. [8, 10]), basin of attrac-
tion (i.e., the set of “start” points that lead system dynamics to a hidden attractor) is
very hardly identiﬁable. This is also discussed in papers [41] and [42], which present
identiﬁcation of basin of attraction for a hidden attractor (in fact the hidden attrac-
tor existence) by means of classical numerical algorithms. Identiﬁcation by EAs is
based on a suitable cost function deﬁnition that expresses the quality of the system
state trajectory and that can be visualized as a surface. The global extreme on the
surface then represents an optimal solution (or a set of start/initial points “leading”
the trajectories to the hidden attractor). As an example of the complexity of such
surfaces, see Fig. 3 and also [31]. From the geometry of such a surface, it is clear
that EAs are the most promising tools to solve such kind of problems due to their
capability to avoid local extremes.

Unconventional Algorithms—Motivation and Brief
Introduction
Before we start to describe how EAs can be used for identiﬁcation and synthesis, we
explain at least basic principles of EAs (for a fully detailed introduction, see [31]).

Evolutionary algorithms are powerful tools that can be used to solve various very
complex engineering problems. Generally speaking, evolutionary techniques can be
divided into two main categories: evolutionary algorithms (such as genetic algo-
rithms, particle swarming, ant colony optimization, . . .). In principle, evolutionary
techniques solve selected problems in the same way as human, which in general can
be used successfully to a large set of engineering problems like the design of different
devices and complex systems identiﬁcation, control and modeling, etc.
Evolutionary techniques have been in existence for quite a long time, successfully
solved many complex problems, showing their powerful applications in engineering
practice and theory (see for example [31]). The following examples demonstrate
successful applications of evolutionary techniques:
• Real-time plasma reactor control. Selected evolutionary algorithms have been
used to control a plasma reactor. No mathematical model was needed. The reactor
was running in real time during experiments. Evolutionary algorithm was used
to estimate 14 parameters so as to eliminate noise from measured signals (see
[43] and [44]). The most important aspect of this contribution is the demonstrated
ability of evolutionary techniques for controlling black-box problems in real-time.
Another very important contribution is the use of laboratory hardware equipment
to calculate the ﬁtness of just-in-time synthesized solutions without knowing a
cost function.
• Fingerprint identiﬁcation. Evolutionary algorithms have been used by computer
scientists (e.g., Grasemann and Miikkulainen, Neural Networks Research Group
from the University of Texas at Austin, USA). Genetic algorithm has been used to
develop a program, which can digitally improve the quality of ﬁngerprint images
better than programs created by human programmers. During evolution, the best
solutions of each generation in the algorithm were recorded and discovered. After
50 generations, the algorithm outperforms the comparable human program. The
algorithm was then synthesized. In a typical FBI application, taking into consid-
eration that the FBI has more than 50 million sets of ﬁngerprints in its archives, so
any algorithm needs to perform about 60,000 digital ﬁngerprint image transactions
every day, it is clear that evolutionary algorithms might soon help speed up such a
time-consuming identiﬁcation process.Results showed that the genetic algorithm
was about 13% more accurate than the well-known 2D algorithm within the same
running time.
• Airplane optimization. Evolutionary techniques are also widely used in airplane
engineering [45]. There are numerous examples of wing optimization and opti-
mal design of various mechanical parts of an airplane under investigation. An
interesting approach is described in [46], where minimization of sonic boom on a
supersonic aircraft was based on an evolutionary algorithm.
• Antennadesign.Inthisapplication,evolutionaryhardwarehasbeenusedtodesign
special antenna for NASA space mission (e.g., the Space Technology 5 Project
(ST5)3). The ST5 space program is focused on the use of identical satellites to test
new space technologies. It is part of the New Millennium Program (NMP). The

NMP was created to identify, develop, build, and test innovative technologies and
concepts to incorporate into future space missions. Despite numerous engineering
designs, this particular design was deemed the best.
• Flow shop scheduling—permutation-based combinatorial optimization. A
very important application in industry is scheduling, to which a number of man-
ufacturing problems are associated. There are many such problems that cannot
be solved by using conventional methods or cannot be solved in reasonable time
(see [31]). Such problems can be successfully solved by evolutionary algorithms,
however. A typical problem is the traveling salesman problem. Today, there exists
the so-called ACO algorithm (see [47]), which is able to solve this hard prob-
lem with cardinality 10000! in a reasonable time yielding good results. The class
of permutation-based combinatorial optimization problem is one of the famous
optimization problems just like traveling salesman problem and vehicle routing
problem. The most realistic and interesting are the shop scheduling problems for
ﬂow shop and job shop.
• Chemical reactor design. In chemical engineering, evolutionary optimization has
been applied to system identiﬁcation [48, 49], where a model of a process is built
and then its parameters are identiﬁed by error minimization against experimental
data. Evolutionary optimization has been widely applied to the evolution of neural
network models for use in control applications (e.g., [50]). There has been increas-
ing awareness of textbook knowledge and heuristics [51], which were commonly
employed in the development of chemical reactors, were deemed responsible for
the lack of innovation, quality, and efﬁciency that characterizes many industrial
designs. In such examples, among many others, it has been proved that evolution-
ary techniques are highly effective for the application in chemical engineering.
• Bioinformatics. Bioinformatics applies information technology to the ﬁeld of
molecular biology. The term bioinformatics was coined by Hogeweg in 1978 for
the study of informatic processes in biotic systems. Today, it entails the creation
and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical tech-
niques, as well as the theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from
management and analysis of biological data. Evolutionary algorithms have been
successfully applied in, for example, multi-objective optimization in modeling of
protein structure prediction [52], evolutionary optimization of metabolic pathways
in [53], and so on (see [54]).
There are many other examples worth of mentioning, where evolutionary algo-
rithms ﬁnd successful applications. Standard evolutionary algorithms exist since the
famous seminal paper [55], however it is not completely true, for more see [31].
If the evolutionary principles are used for the purposes of complex calculations,
see [31], the following EA principles are used:
1. Speciﬁcation of the evolutionary parameters: For each algorithm, parameters
that control the run of the algorithm or terminate it must be deﬁned regularly, if
the termination criterion deﬁned in advance is fulﬁlled (for example, the number
of cycles—generations). Part of this point is the deﬁnition of the cost function
(objective function) or, as the case may be, what is called ﬁtness–a modiﬁed

436
I. Zelinka
return value of the objective function). The objective function is usually a math-
ematical model of the problem, whose minimization or maximization leads to
the solution of the problem. This function with possible limiting conditions is
some kind of environmental equivalent in which the quality of current individ-
uals is assessed.
2. Generation of the initial population (generally N × M matrix, where N is
the number of parameters of an individual—D is used hereinafter in this
publication—and M is the number of individuals in the population): Depending
on the number of optimized arguments of the objective function and the user’s
criteria, the initial population of individuals is generated. An individual is a vec-
tor of numbers having such a number of components as the number of optimized
parameters of the objective function. These components are set randomly and
each individual thus represents one possible speciﬁc solution to the problem.
The set of individuals is called population.
3. All the individuals are evaluated through a deﬁned objective function, and each
of them is assigned either a) a direct value of the return objective function, or b)
a ﬁtness value, which is a modiﬁed (usually normalized) value of the objective
function.
4. Now parents are selected according to their quality (ﬁtness, value of the objective
function) or, as the case may be, also according to other criterions.
5. Descendants are created by crossbreeding the parents. The process of cross-
breeding is different for each algorithm. Parts of parents are changed in classic
genetic algorithms, in a differential evolution, crossbreeding is a certain vector
operation, etc.
6. Every descendant is mutated. In other words, a new individual is changed by
means of a suitable random process. This step is equivalent to the biological
mutation of the genes of an individual.
7. Every new individual is evaluated in the same manner as in step 3.
8. The best individuals are selected.
9. The selected individuals ﬁll a new population.
10. The old population is forgotten (eliminated, deleted, dies,..) and is replaced by
a new population; step 4 represents further continuation.
Steps 4–10 are repeated until the number of evolution cycles speciﬁed before
by the user is reached or until the required quality of the solution is achieved. The
principle of the evolutionary algorithm outlined above is general and may more or
less differ in speciﬁc cases. For more explanation, it is recommended to read chapters
1–3 in [31].
There are also exemptions that do not adhere to steps 1–10; in such a case, the
corresponding algorithms are not denoted as evolutionary algorithms, but usually as
algorithms that belong to EAs. Some evolutionists exclude them completely from
the EA class. The ACO algorithm (Ant Colony Optimization), see [56], may be
an example–it simulates the behavior of an ant colony and can solve extremely
complicated combinatorial problems. It is based on the principles of cooperation of
several individuals belonging to the same colony, which are ants in the present case.

Unconventional Algorithms and Hidden Chaotic Attractors
437
As an example, we can mention two kinds of algorithms, i.e. differential evolution
(DE), that has been derived from genetic algorithms and belongs today amongst
the most powerful algorithms and SOMA, that is of comparable performance to
modern algorithms including DE and represents swarm algorithms as well as PSO
for example.
Differential Evolution [57] is a population-based optimization method that works
on real-number coded individuals. For each individual xi,G in the current generation
G, differential evolution (DE) generates a new trial individual x′
i,G by adding the
weighted difference between two randomly selected individuals xr1,G and xr2,G to a
randomly selected third individual xr3,G. The resulting individual x′
i,G is crossed-over
with the original individual xi,G. The ﬁtness of the resulting individual, referred to as
a perturbed vector ui,G+1, is then compared with the ﬁtness of xi,G. If the ﬁtness of
ui,G+1 is greater than the ﬁtness of xi,G, then xi,G is replaced with ui,G+1; otherwise
xi,G remains in the population as xi,G+1. Differential Evolution is robust, fast, and
effective with a global optimization ability. It does not require the objective function
to be differentiable, and it works well even with noisy, epistatic and time-dependent
objective functions.

SOMA is a stochastic optimization algorithm that is modeled based on the social
behavior of competitive-cooperating individuals [58]. It was chosen because it has
beenprovedthatthisalgorithmhastheabilitytoconvergetowardstheglobaloptimum
[58]. SOMA works on a population of candidate solutions in loops, called migration
loops. The population is initialized by uniform random distribution over the search
space at the beginning of the search. In each loop, the population is evaluated and the
solution with the best cost value becomes the Leader. Apart from the Leader, in one
migration loop, all individuals will traverse the searched space in the direction of the
leader. It ensures diversity amongst all the individuals and it also provides a means to
restore lost information in a population. Mutation is different in SOMA as compared

with other EAs. SOMA uses a parameter called P RT to achieve perturbations. The
P RT vector deﬁnes the ﬁnal movement of an active individual in the search space.
The randomly generated binary perturbation vector controls the allowed dimensions
for an individual. If an element of the perturbation vector is set to zero, then the
individual is not allowed to change its position in the corresponding dimension.
An individual will travel over a certain distance (called the PathLength) towards
the leader in ﬁnite steps of the deﬁned length. If the PathLength is chosen to be
greater than one, then the individual will overshoot the Leader. This path is perturbed
randomly.
Pseudocode for SOMA is:

Evolutionary Identiﬁcation—Case Example
The performance and possibility of EAs use on hidden attractor identiﬁcation have
been fully described and demonstrated in [1]. In this chapter, we only brieﬂy men-
tioned the principles and some results. For full information, it is recommended to
read [1]. In this case study, DE and SOMA have been used in order to identify
whether hidden attractor exists inside system or not, i.e. EA identiﬁcation of hidden
attractors did not reconstruct basin of attraction of hidden attractors but served as a
binary classiﬁcation whether hidden attractor is present or not.
3.1
Used Algorithm and Its Setting
All experiments reported in [1] were done with selected EAs in repeated numerical
simulations. The used algorithms were differential evolution (DERand1Bin) and

Unconventional Algorithms and Hidden Chaotic Attractors
439
[57], SOMA (AllToOne) [58]. In our future research, other algorithms, like genetic
algorithms (GAs) [59], simulated annealing (SA) [60, 61], PSO [62] or ES [63, 64],
are extensions of this study with more systems that contain hidden attractors. The
setting of the algorithm is given in [1].
Both algorithms (i.e. SOMA + DE) have been applied 100 times in order to ﬁnd
the optimum of both case studies. The primary aim of this comparative study is
not to show which algorithm is better or worse, but to show whether evolutionary
algorithms are applicable to the identiﬁcation of the basin of attraction related to a
hidden attractor.
All experiments were done in Mathematica 10, on MacBook Pro, 2.8 GHz Intel
Core 2 Duo.
3.2
Used System with Hidden Attractor
Typical hidden attractor, used in paper [1] comes from electronics and has been
reported in [4, 65] or in special issue [5] and another research papers,4 [11, 12].
It is Chua’s attractor that can be observed, for example, in the electronic circuit of
Chua’s oscillator. Electronic circuits are among the most popular systems used to
demonstrate deterministic chaos. Their popularity stems from the fact that electronic
circuits are easy to set up and provide fast response to control inputs and settings.
Typical representatives of electronic circuits with deterministic chaos is Chua’s oscil-
lator, see Fig. 4. The core of Chua’s circuit is a nonlinear resistor, sometimes called
Chua’s diode [1, 66].
In Fig. 4 Chua’s attractor visualized by the program Mathematica together with
its hidden attractor. Chua’s circuit can be described mathematically by Eq. (5), which
can be used to simulate the behavior of the circuit:
Chua’s system
x′(t) = α(y(t) −x(t) −m1x(t) −0.5(m0 −m1)sat(x))
y′(t) = x(t) −y(t) + z(t)
z′(t) = −βy(t) −γ z(t)
with saturation function
sat(x) = |x(t) + 1| −|x(t) −1|
initial conditions
x(0) ∈[−10, 10], y(0) ∈[−10, 10], z(0) ∈[−15, 15]

If suitable initial conditions are set as described in (5), a chaotic attractor can be
found in the system (Fig. 4). In our experiments Chua’s and hidden attractor have
been set according to [4] and [5]. It is reported in Eq. (5). Besides Chua’s system,
there are also discrete systems exhibiting HA, as reported in [6], however in [1] is
reported Chua’s system as a more real (i.e. electronic) system.
3.3
Cost Function and Its Visualization
The most important part of the experiments was the cost function deﬁnition, that is
then used by evolutionary algorithms and is a core of whole process. With wrong cost
functiondeﬁnitiononewouldgetdeﬁnitelywrongresults.So,itsconstruction–setting
up, is crucial for the EAs use. The cost function was based on Chua’s circuit with
setting for its hidden attractor. For experiments reported here few simpliﬁcations have
been done, because in fact, in Chua’s system there are 8 adjustable parameters: 3 for
initial conditions (x(0), y(0) and z(0)) and 5 for parameter settings (m0, m1, α, β and

Unconventional Algorithms and Hidden Chaotic Attractors
441
γ ). So in total it is possible to search in the 8-dimensional space (compare complexity
of simpler chaotic case in Fig.3, [1]). For simplicity we ﬁxed 5 parameters (so that
hidden attractor would exist) and only 3 initial conditions were under investigation
by EAs in order to ﬁnd points belonging to the domain of its attraction. The cost
function was set up as in Eq. (6). System (5) of three differential equations has
been calculated for each evaluation of Eq. (6) in time t ∈[0, 200] and trajectories
data from the last 50s has been used (to avoid possible initial trajectory transition
with bigger amplitudes, as can be observed in [1]). The parameter Diam(eter) has
been set empirically to be ∈[3, 11] and guarantees that if trajectory fulﬁlls Eq.
(6), then trajectory is trapped in hidden attractor. Otherwise, the returned value of
Eq. (6) was usually extremely big, as 108, 10153, etc., due to the trajectory escaping
to the inﬁnity. Thus, individuals (i.e. coordinates of the start trajectory) with CF=0
represented solutions.

(6)
Dynamics of Eq. (5) according to Eq. (6), can be visualized in few different ways
and as an example, few typical visualizations are depicted here. Because there were 3
variables (i.e. cost function surface is in 4-dimensional space), cost function surface
can be visualized so that one variable is set to constant value and the remaining two are
changed in the allowed interval. Typical examples of ﬁgures is then Fig. 6, for more
see [1]. The black area represents the basin of attraction, i.e. the set of initial points
whose trajectory leads to the standard Chua’s attractor (see bigger attractor in Fig.
4). On the contrary, when parameters (m0, m1, α, β and γ ) are set for hidden attractor
existence, then basin of attraction is very small, as shown in Fig. 5, or even complex
as Fig. 6 suggest. Both ﬁgures show, how basin of attraction changes its shape and
structure, when for example z(0) is changed (in fact they are xy slice of the attraction
domain for a ﬁxed z(0).). It is also important to mention that graphic visualization
of basins of attraction is only an approximation of the real one and depends on the
setting of the graphical resolution which, of course, is limited on PCs. Confront with
Fig. 6, where high resolution has to be set in numerical computation in order to made
those few points visible.
It is logical to expect that the structure of the complete basin of attraction based
on Eq. (6), will be more complex and changed as all 8 parameters of the Eq. (5)
will be changed. Here, as in the initial study on this matter, we are concerned on
EAs identiﬁcation of initial conditions that lead to hidden attractor, when parameters
x(0) and y(0) searched in interval [−10, 10], for z(0) = 8.7739 and −13.4705, i.e.
individual has “only” dimension 2. For more details, see [1].

3.4
Results
The results of EAs identiﬁcation of the basin of attraction come from experiments
with SOMA and DE [1]. Both algorithms were repeated 100 times and for each indi-
vidual, and its cost function evaluation was calculated by Eq. (5). All visualizations
have been done by means of Mathematica 10. In both algorithms and all experiments
were successfully located initial points that belong to the basin of attraction, i.e. we
have successfully identiﬁed its existence within the system. As results in [1] shows
then for algorithm SOMA (for example) has located basin of attraction after few
migrations. The same can be stated for DE. Another interesting result was that both
EAs, during their evolution, have identiﬁed not only one hidden attractor, as reported
in [4], but also stable limit cycle in it, as is depicted in [1] where it is visible that
despite the fact that both kinds of trajectories are very close at the start, they end
up in different behavior as hidden attractor or limit cycle is. This just conﬁrms that
basin of attraction shall be really complex and tiny. For more details see [1].
Besides continuous dynamical systems like Chua’s system, there are discrete
dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior, which are already under study in [6].
Such systems have different basins of attraction and of course attractors themselves,
see Fig. 7, Eq. (7). The use of EAs on such systems is, in principle, the same and is
at the moment under our investigation.

yn+1 = xn −0.3y2

(7)
Another possibility to use EAs on hidden attractors research is the so-called sym-
bolic regression, i.e. evolutionary synthesis of complex structures, in this case of
chaotic systems containing hidden attractors. In the next subsections we discuss

basic principles of symbolic regression and show its use on classical chaotic system
synthesis use. Possibilities on synthesis of hidden attractors containing systems are
then discussed in further section about research ideas—proposals at the end.

Evolutionary Synthesis
Evolutionary synthesis is, in fact, a process during which evolution is used as a tool
that creates new structures based on user demands and basic object (i.e. building
blocks) deﬁnition. It can be generally called a symbolic regression. The term “sym-
bolic regression” represents a process during which measured data sets are ﬁtted
thereby a corresponding mathematical formula is obtained in an analytical way. An

basin of attraction for the

output of the symbolic expression could be, for example,
N

k , and the like.
For a long time, symbolic regression was a domain of human calculations, but in the
last few decades, it involves computers for symbolic computation as well.
4.1
Selected Methods
The initial idea of symbolic regression by means of a computer program was pro-
posed in Genetic Programming (GP) [3, 67]. The other approaches are Grammatical
Evolution (GE) developed in [68] and Analytic Programming (AP) in [2]. Other
interesting investigations using symbolic regression were carried out in [69] on Arti-
ﬁcial Immune Systems and Probabilistic Incremental Program Evolution (PIPE),
which generates functional programs from an adaptive probability distribution over
all possible programs. As an extension of GE to the other algorithms is also [70],
where differential evolution was used with the GE. Symbolic regression is, generally
speaking, a process which combines, evaluates and creates more complex structures
based on some elementary and non-complex objects, in an evolutionary way. Such
elementary objects are usually simple mathematical operators (+, −, ×, . . . ), simple
functions (sin, cos, And, Not, …), user-deﬁned functions (simple commands for
robots–MoveLeft, TurnRight, …), etc. An output of symbolic regression is a more
complex “object” (formula, function, command,…), solving a given problem like
data ﬁtting of the so-called Sextic and Quintic problem described in [2, 3], randomly
synthesized function [2], Boolean problems of parity and symmetry solution (basi-

Unconventional Algorithms and Hidden Chaotic Attractors

cally logical circuits synthesis) or synthesis of quite complex robot control command
as in [2, 3]. Examples mentioned here are just a few samples from numerous repeated
experiments done by AP, which are used to demonstrate how complex structures can
be produced by symbolic regression in general for different problems.
The method described and demonstrated for experiments in this part is called
Analytic Programming (AP), which has been compared to GP with very good results
(see, for example, [2, 3, 31]).
4.2
Chaotic Systems Synthesis
ThecapabilityoftheEAstosynthesizechaoticsystemshasbeenclearlydemonstrated
in [30] and [31] where an artiﬁcial (i.e. no real equivalent systems are in nature)
chaotic systems have been synthesized. In this case, synthesis was focused only on
“non-hidden” chaotic systems, however it is clear that it is obviously only a matter
of little changes in our previous synthesis algorithm.
For an inspiration and motivation, consider how EAs were used for chaos synthesis
bymentioningsomemainresults.Forfullanddetailedinformationitisrecommended
to read [30] and [31]. The synthesis was based on logistic equation structure and on
the fact that the logistic equation is a well-known simplest system that can produce
chaotic behavior. This equation is also well analyzed. It was expected that evolu-
tionary search would be possible to synthesize the logistic equation, which was, in
fact, a source of elements for GFS. Evolutionary synthesis of logistic equation was
actually observed, as further discussed in [30] and [31]. Another reason behind the
selection of the logistic equation is that results from designed experiments can be
easily compared, veriﬁed and analyzed.
Basic set of objects used in symbolic regression are { x, A, +, −, × /}. It is
also important to note that experiments provided here, i.e., evolutionary synthe-
sis of chaotic systems, are not restricted to one-dimensional chaotic maps but can
be applied in principle to the synthesis of higher-dimensional and more complex
chaotic systems. This declaration is based on many other successful complex exam-
ples accomplished by GP, GE and AP in the past.
In this investigation, a total of 1300 independent simulations were completed, 100
trials by each of the 13 algorithms. Each simulation was started at randomly selected
initial conditions (i.e., each initial population was randomly generated).
During our experimentation we have got a lot of very interesting chaotic systems,
for selected examples see Figs. 8, 9, 10 and 11 related to Eqs. (8)–(15). In [30] and
[31], one can see full results and analysis of obtained systems from different point
of views.

A Few Research Questions and Ideas
The above text has discussed the possibility on identiﬁcation and possible synthesis
of chaotic systems that contain hidden attractors. The topic of mutual intersection of
hidden attractors and EAs can also be discussed from another point of view, which
would generate a lot of interesting research questions. Let’s discuss–propose a few
of them.
In [32] and [31] it is demonstrated that inside EAs dynamics chaotic behavior can
be observed. If in EAs there exist chaotic behavior, i.e. chaotic regimes (see Figs.
12 and 13, [31, 32]), then an important question for computer science researchers
is whether and how such chaotic behavior can inﬂuence the EAs performance. This
is quite an important question, because EAs are used on very hard problems, whose
solutions by brute force or by classical methods can take much much longer time than
our universe existence [31] or time, which is not, for practical reasons, acceptable.
Thus, the performance of EAs is a very important topic.
It is not only about performance, but also about relations between chaos existing in
EAs, and relation with different EA phases and the so-called stagnation, population
diversity and speed of the algorithm convergence toward to global optimum. Another
partial question whether hidden attractors exist in EAs dynamics and if yes, then
again, what impact does it have on that? Does it disturb algorithm performance? Is it
related to algorithm stagnation [71]? Concerning simple chaotic systems such as the
logistic equation, they were derived from natural systems as predator-prey is, thus
from systems based on swarm behavior and structure. Are then hidden attractors also
inside swarm systems? Concerning with performance of EAs inﬂuenced by chaos,
important research papers have already been published, such as [39, 72].
It is also joined with control of chaotic systems whose chaotic regimes are not
acceptable in classical engineering and thus questions arise, like, can we successfully
avoid by control being trapped in a hidden attractor. Or, if we can control hidden
attractors is also important. Remember that all systems reported here and in many
other papers are artiﬁcial and well known a priori. Thus, its control and analysis are
very easy (due to easy model readability and knowledge) comparing it with possible
hidden attractors present in black box of real-time systems. In the past, it has been
clearly demonstrated that EAs are capable of such tasks, see [43, 44]. However, it
is still an important topic that deserves more and deeper research. Can we identify
hidden attractors in real-time black box systems? Can we control it in/out of the
hidden attractor regime?
Back to swarm systems, there are also other interesting directions. A simpler one
is about artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) with chaos inside it, see for example [73,
74]. During learning, there are different regimes during which information is stored
in ANN. Existence of hidden attractor can then have fundamental impact on ANN
capabilities and performance. Next, another interdisciplinary research joining EAs,
chaos, hidden attractors and control is proposed in [1] and is under process by our
research group5. The main idea is captured in Fig. 14, see [75, 76] and [77]. Here,

Unconventional Algorithms and Hidden Chaotic Attractors
451
swarm dynamics of selected algorithms is converted into complex networks that
reﬂect its dynamics and thus by means of classic complex network analysis we can
get information about EA dynamics and use it backward to control EAs performance.
However, it can be translated further and complex networks can be converted into a
CML (coupled map lattices) systems [10], which can also be controlled and analyzed
but in a different way. In complex networks, we can also analyze the presence of
chaos as well as in CML [10], thus a research space for hidden attractors to exist in
such systems (i.e. in EAs, CN or CML) is provided.

Conclusion
The main motivation of the research on the existence of hidden attractors is not only
its theoretical importance, but also its impact on technological and industrial devices,
as mentioned above in the Introduction section. The main interest here is whether
EAs can be used on evolutionary identiﬁcation of the basin of attraction that belongs
to a hidden attractor, and its synthesis. Successful identiﬁcation then can help to
avoid critical moments and device malfunctions. For numerical identiﬁcations, there
are already published representative papers like [41] and [42], based on classical
(i.e. non-evolutionary) algorithms. On the other side, EAs are well known for their
very good performance (including on black-box systems) and ability to avoid local
extremes, e.g. Fig. 3, shall be very promising candidates to solve such tasks as well.
Based on results obtained from our initial experiments [1], it can be stated that EAs
are applicable to such problems and their performances are very good. We have also
discussed the possibility on evolutionary synthesis of chaotic systems and suggested
its use on synthesis of chaotic systems that will (or will not) contain HA, based on
the user’s expectation.
In the last part, few research ideas have been suggested. All of them come from
mutualintersection-fusionofnonlineardynamicsandevolutionaryalgorithms,which
are regarded as nonlinear dynamical systems that also exhibit chaotic behaviors, with
or without HA. Related and unanswered question from this research (and mutual
intersections discussed in [31]) is whether one can observe hidden attractors also in
evolutionary algorithms dynamics and what impact it has on EAs performance. The
existence of chaos inside EAs has been “proven” and numerically demonstrated in
[32] and thus possible existence of hidden attractors is theoretically almost surely.

454
I. Zelinka
This question can also be expanded for control and EAs dynamics, as discussed in
[75, 76] and [10], which allows in principle to analyze and control EAs dynamics.
Many chaotic systems based on discrete systems are derived from natural as well
as social systems and thus are related to the real world. On the other side, another
set of artiﬁcially made discrete chaotic systems can be generated (synthesized) for
technical or technological purposes as demonstrated in [31]. In this chapter and
related papers, evolutionary algorithms have been used in order to synthesize discrete
chaotic systems with interesting properties. This suggests that hidden attractors not
only can be observed in existing systems, but also can be artiﬁcially synthesized
on demand, if necessary. Thus, evolution can be used in two complementary ways:
identiﬁcation (outlined here and in the [41, 42] and [1] for example) and design (see
an initial study in [31]). However, it deserves deeper research that is out of scope of
this chapter.

Hidden Attractors in a Dynamical
System with a Sine Function

Introduction
In the last decades, chaotic systems and their applications have received signiﬁcant
attention [1–13]. When discovering chaotic systems, equilibrium points are studied
seriously because of their important role [12, 14–16]. Conventional chaotic sys-
tems, especially 3-D chaotic systems, like Lorenz system [17], Rössler system [18],
Arneodo system [19], Chen system [20] and Sprott systems (except case A) [21]
have a ﬁnite or countable number of equilibrium points. Therefore, chaotic behavior
in systems like those mentioned above can be veriﬁed by applying the well-known
Šil’nikov criteria [22, 23].
Recently, great interest in dynamical systems with hidden attractors has been
raised. The term “hidden attractor” refers to the fact that in this class of systems
the attractor is not associated with an unstable equilibrium and thus often remains
undiscovered because it may occur in a small region of parameter space with a small
basin of attraction in the space of initial conditions [24–29]. Hidden attractors, in

contrast to self-excited attractors, cannot be computed by the standard procedure
because their basins of attraction do not contain neighborhoods of any equilibria. In
general, chaotic systems with hidden attractors belong to three main families:
(i) systems with stable equilibria, (ii) systems with an inﬁnite number of equilib-
rium points and (iii) systems without any equilibrium point. So, there has been an
increasing interest in chaotic systems with the presence of hidden attractors recently.
In 2010, for the ﬁrst time, a chaotic hidden attractor was discovered in the
most well-known nonlinear circuit, Chua’s circuit, which is described by a three-
dimensional dynamical system [24, 30]. However, the problem of analyzing hidden
oscillations arose for the ﬁrst time in the second part of Hilbert’s 16th problem
(1900) for two-dimensional polynomial systems [31]. The ﬁrst nontrivial results
were obtained in Bautin’s works [32], which were devoted to constructing nested
limit cycles in quadratic systems, showing the necessity of studying hidden oscilla-
tions for solving this problem.
Later, in the middle of the 20th century, Kapranov [33] studied the qualitative
behavior of Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) systems, which are used in telecommunica-
tions and computer architectures, and estimating system stability domains. In that
work, Kapranov assumed that in PLL systems there were only self-excited oscilla-
tions. However, in 1961, Gubar [34] revealed a gap in Kapranov’s work and ana-
lytically showed the possibility of the existence of hidden oscillations in a two-
dimensional system of PLL. Thus, from a computational point of view, the system
considered was globally stable which, however, has only a bounded domain of attrac-
tion.
Also, in the same period of time, the investigations of widely-known Markus-
Yamabe [35] and Kalman [36] conjectures on absolute stability led to the ﬁnding
of hidden oscillations in automatic control systems with a unique stable stationary
point and a special nonlinearity belonging to the sector of linear stability [37–39].
Furthermore, systems with hidden attractors have received increasing attention
due to their practical and theoretical importance in other scientiﬁc branches such
as mechanics, ﬂuids, electronic circuits, etc. [40–49]. Therefore, the study of these
systems is an interesting topic of extremely signiﬁcant importance.
In this chapter, a three-dimensional autonomous chaotic system with a sine func-
tion, which can display inﬁnitely many equilibria, is presented for the ﬁrst time.
System’s dynamics are discovered by analyzing equilibrium points, and by using
well-known tools from nonlinear theory, such as phase portrait, Poincaré map, bifur-
cation diagram, maximum Lyapunov fvexponents, and the Kaplan-Yorke fractional
dimension. Also, the design of an electronic circuit emulating the system, in which
the sine function has been replaced with a Taylor series expansion, proves the feasi-
bility of the proposed framework.
The chapter is organized as follows. In Sect.2 related works are summarized.
The mathematical model of the system with inﬁnitely many equilibria is introduced
in Sect.3, while in Sect.4 its dynamical properties are presented. In Sect.5, the
system with a Taylor series expansion of the sine function is studied. The circuital
implementation of the system is reported in Sect.6. Finally, some concluding remarks
are given in Sect.7.

Related Works
As it is mentioned, one of the classes of systems with hidden attractors is the class of
systems with uncountably many equilibria [41, 50–55]. Today, there are two main
research directions related to chaotic systems with an inﬁnite number of equilibrium
points, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
On one hand, motivated by the key work of Jafari and Sprott [56], which focuses
on chaotic systems with a line of equilibrium points, ﬁve new chaotic ﬂows with line
equilibrium points and especially a complicated one with two inﬁnite parallel lines of
equilibrium points, were discovered by Li and Sprott [50]. By using signum functions
and absolute-value functions, chaotic systems with a line or two perpendicular lines
of equilibrium points were introduced in [57].
On the other hand, after the discovery of a new class of chaotic systems with
circular equilibrium points [58], which concentrates on chaotic systems with a curve
of equilibrium points, Kingni et al. [59] presented a 3D chaotic autonomous system
with a circular curve of equilibrium points and its fractional-order form. Then, Got-
thans et al. [53] reported another chaotic system with a circular curve of equilibrium
points, where a 3D system was reported with a square curve of equilibrium points,
constructed by modifying the system with a circular curve of equilibrium points in
[53]. In addition, a system exhibiting a chaotic attractor with an ellipse curve of
equilibrium points, a chaotic attractor with a square-shaped curve of equilibrium
points, and a chaotic attractor with a rectangle-shaped curve of equilibrium points,
were presented in Ref.[60].

C. Volos et al.
The aim of this chapter is to open up a new research direction to the construction
of chaotic systems with inﬁnitely many equilibrium points, by using the well-known
trigonometric functions. In this way, system’s equilibria are located in trigonometric
curves. In more detail, the sine function is chosen for use in a selected system, so as
to make the system display hidden attractors.

Model of the Proposed System
Consider the following three-dimensional system:
˙x = −z,
˙y = xz2 + a sgn(z),
˙z = f1(x, y) + zf2(x, y, z),
(1)
where x, y, z are state variables, a is a positive parameter, and f1, f2 are two
nonlinear functions.
The equilibrium points of system (1) can be found by solving
−z = 0,
(2)
xz2 + a sgn(z) = 0,
(3)
f1(x, y) + zf2(x, y, z) = 0.
(4)
Therefore, on the plane z = 0, system (1) has equilibrium points located on the
following curve:
f1(x, y) = 0.
(5)
So, by choosing different kinds of nonlinear function f1, equilibrium points of system
(1) can be located on various curves.
Select the following two functions f1, f2:
f1(x, y) = x −b sin(y),
(6)
f2(x, y, z) = cy2 −z2,
(7)
where b, c are positive parameters. System (1) can be rewritten as
˙x = −z,
˙y = xz2 + a sgn(z),
˙z = x −b sin(y) + z(cy2 −z2).

Hidden Attractors in a Dynamical System with a Sine Function

From Eqs. (5) and (6), it is easy to see that system (8) has inﬁnitely equilibria
(E) located on a trigonometric curve, E(b sin(y∗), y∗, 0). As a result, the proposed
system (8) can be considered as a chaotic system with hidden attractors [25, 39, 41].
When selecting a = 0.28, b = 0.2, c = 2.5 and initial conditions (x0, y0, z0) =
(0.1, 0.1, 0.1), the Lyapunov exponents of system (8) are obtained as
L1 = 0.09254, L2 = 0, L3 = −0.47397.
(9)
There is one positive Lyapunov exponent in the LE spectrum (9), thus the proposed
system (8) exhibits chaotic behavior, as it is conﬁrmed by the phase portraits in
Figs. 2, 3 and 4 on various planes, and the strange attractor of the Poincaré map in
Fig. 5.
In addition, since L1 + L2 + L3 = −0.38143 < 0, it indicates that the system (8)
is dissipative.
The Kaplan-Yorke fractional dimension, which presents the complexity of attrac-
tor is deﬁned by
DKY = j +

(10)
where j is the largest integer satisfying  j
i=1 Li ≤0 and  j+1
i=1 Li < 0. The Kaplan-
Yorke dimension of the proposed system (8) is calculated as
DKY = 2 + L1 + L2
|L3|
= 2.1952,
(11)
which is fractional.

Dynamics and Properties of the Proposed System
4.1
Dissipativity and Invariance
By applying the general condition of dissipativity into system (8), we have
div u = ∂˙x
∂x + ∂˙y
∂y + ∂˙z
∂z .
(12)
Therefore, system (8) is dissipative for cy2 −3z2 < 0. The invariance of system (8)
is indicated by the coordinate transformation (x, y, z) −→(−x, −y, −z).

Equilibrium Point Analysis
The equilibrium point of system (8) is
E = (b sin y∗, y∗, 0).
(13)
The Jacobian of the system is
⎡
⎣
0

−1

⎤
⎦
and the characteristic for the equilibrium point E is
λ3 −cy∗2λ2 + λ(1 + 2ab cos y∗) = 0.
(14)
So, the system always has one eigenvalue equal to zero (λ1 = 0) and two other
eigenvalues determined by the discriminant of the second-order part of the charac-
teristic, given by
Δ = c2y∗4 −8ab cos y∗−4 .
(15)
When Δ = 0, the system has a double real positive eigenvalue λ = cy∗2
2
and the
equilibrium point is unstable.
When Δ > 0, the system has a pair of real eigenvalues λ = cy∗2±

with positive real parts, and so the equilibrium point is unstable.
From the above analysis, we conclude that E is an unstable equilibrium point.
4.3
System Dynamics
In this subsection, the system’s bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponent spec-
trum, which are classical tools from nonlinear theory, are used for the investigation
of nonlinear system dynamics [13]. The bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponent
spectrum of system (8) are reported in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. As shown in Figs. 6
and 7, system (8) exhibits chaotic and periodic behaviors when changing the value
of the bifurcation parameter c from 0.0 to 3.5. Also, the system exhibits the well-
known route to chaos through the mechanism of period doublings, as the parameter
c increases. In more details, when the value of c < 0.928, system (8) remains in
the periodic state (as illustrated in Figs. 8, 9, for c = 0.1 and c = 0.5), where all
the Lyapunov exponents are LC E ≤0. When c > 0.928, it is easy to see that more
complex behavior is merged (the system (8) has one positive Lyapunov exponent

Coexistence of Hidden Attractors
As it is mentioned, system (8) has rotational symmetry with respect to the origin
of the axes as evidenced by their invariance under the transformation from (x, y, z)
to (−x, −y, −z). Therefore, any projection of the attractor has symmetry. As it has
been known, symmetric systems generally have coexisting attractors [61–63]. Thus,
such complex dynamics of system (8) is investigated here by plotting forward and
backward continuations for the bifurcation parameter c, with a = 0.25 and b = 0.2.
The continuations of system (8) indicate the presence of multi-stability in the system
(Fig. 11). For example, there are coexisting chaotic attractors when c = 1.4, as shown
in Fig. 12

Approximation of Sine Function with Taylor Series
Expansion
The aim of this work is also to present an electronic circuit that emulates the proposed
system (8) with hidden attractors and study its behavior. However, the absence of a
chip that can produce the trigonometric functions is a big problem in this consider-
ation. Two decades ago, a chip (AD639) was presented, which was a high-accuracy
monolithic function converter that provides all the standard trigonometric functions
and their inverses via pin-strapping. Nevertheless, this chip is not produced any-
more today. This is the main reason that the trigonometric functions, mainly sine and

continuation (red), for a = 0.25 and b = 0.2
cosine, are not used as nonlinear functions in electronic circuits. As a consequence,
other ways for producing such functions should be searched for.
The most appropriate way for implementing the sine and cosine functions is using
the Taylor series expansions, which can be implemented easily with the analog mul-
tipliers (AD633). In mathematics, a Taylor series is a representation of a function as
an inﬁnite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function’s deriva-
tives at a single point. The concept of a Taylor series was formulated by the Scottish
mathematician James Gregory and formally introduced by the English mathemati-
cian Brook Taylor in 1715 [64, 65]. If the Taylor series is centered at zero, then the
series is also called a Maclaurin series, named after the Scottish mathematician Colin
Maclaurin, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th
century.
A function can be approximated by using a ﬁnite number of terms of its Taylor
series. Taylor’s theorem gives quantitative estimates on the errors introduced by the
use of such an approximation. The polynomial formed by taking some initial terms
of the Taylor series is called a Taylor polynomial. The Taylor series of a function is
the limit of that function’s Taylor polynomials as the degree increases, provided that
the limit exists. A function may not be equal to its Taylor series, even if its Taylor
series converges at every point. A function that is equal to its Taylor series in an
open interval (or a disc in the complex plane) is known as an analytic function in
that interval.
In the case of the sine function, its Taylor series approximation is given by

By taking the ﬁrst four terms of the sine series expansion, as in Eq. (16), the error
in this approximation is no more than |x|9/9!. In particular, for −1 < x < 1, the
error is less than 0.000003. Also, as it is known, y = sin x is an odd function (i.e.,
sin(−x) = −sin(x)). For this reason, the Taylor series of y = sin x has only odd
powers, which plays a crucial role in the case of the proposed system (8).
In this section, the term sin(y) in system (8) is replaced with its Taylor series
approximation, and the following system is then obtained:

˙y = xz2 + asgn(z),
˙z = x −b

(17)
The dynamical behavior of system (17) was studied and the results of the comparison
with the original system (8) are presented in details as follows.
1. It is easy to see that system (17) has inﬁnitely equilibrium points (E) located on a
curve, E(y∗−(y∗)3
3!
+ (y∗)5
5!
−(y∗)7
7! , y∗, 0). As a result, the proposed system (17)
can also be considered as a chaotic system with hidden attractors.
2. For the same set of parameters (a = 0.28, b = 0.2, c = 2.5) and initial conditions
(x0, y0, z0) = (0.1, 0.1, 0.1), the Lyapunov exponents of the system (17) are:
L1 = 0.09533, L2 = 0, L3 = −0.43701.
(18)
There is one positive Lyapunov exponent in the Lyapunov exponent spectrum
(18), thus the system (17) exhibits the expected chaotic behavior. In addition,
since L1 + L2 + L3 = −0.34168 < 0, it indicates that the system (17) is also
dissipative.
Furthermore, the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the system (17) is
DKY = 2 + L1 + L2
|L3|
= 2.1814
(19)
which is fractional.
3. Also, by a comparison of the phase portraits in Figs. 13, 14 and 15 on various
planes, and the Poincaré map in Fig. 16, with the respective phase portraits in
Figs. 2, 3 and 4 and the Poincaré map in Fig. 5, a very good agreement is obtained.

c = 2.5, with initial conditions (x0, y0, z0) = (0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
4. By applying the general condition of dissipativity to system (17), the same results
as in system (8) are concluded:
div u = ∂˙x
∂x + ∂˙y
∂y + ∂˙z
∂z = cy2 −3z2.
(20)
Therefore, system (17) is also dissipative for cy2 −3z2 < 0.
5. From the comparison of the bifurcation diagram of system (17) with the respec-
tive bifurcation diagram of system (8), a good agreement in their dynamics is
concluded (see Fig. 17).
6. System (17) has also rotational symmetry with respect to the origin of the
axes, as evidenced by their invariance under the transformation from (x, y, z)
to (−x, −y, −z). Therefore, any projection of the attractor has symmetry. By
plotting forwards and backward continuations for the bifurcation parameter c,
the presence of multi-stability in system (17) can be investigated (Fig. 18). For
example, there are coexisting chaotic attractors when c = 1.4, as shown in Fig. 19.
From the study of dynamical behavior of system (17), a good agreement with
the results produced by system (8), with the sine function, is obtained. So, system
(17) with the Taylor series approximation of the sine function should be circuitry
implementable as it will be presented in the next section.

Circuit Implementation of the Proposed System
The errors in numerical simulations and the long simulation time, when investigat-
ing dynamics of chaotic systems, lead to the consideration of their effective physical
implementation [66–69]. In addition, the hardware implementation of mathematical
chaotic models is an important topic from the viewpoint of practical applications in
various engineering ﬁelds, such as secure communications, robotics, signal genera-
tion, neural networks, control systems, encryption schemes, etc. [67, 70–75]. Non-
linear dynamical systems can be realized by using commercially available ampliﬁers,
integrated circuits or FPGAs [76–78].
It is noted that, when using commercially available ampliﬁers, one should be
aware of their limitations [79]. In this direction, an electronic circuit that emulates
the mathematical model (17) is presented, to show its feasibility (Fig. 20). It has
20 resistors, 3 capacitors, 9 operational ampliﬁers and 9 analog multipliers. There
are three integrators, which are created by the operational ampliﬁers (U1 −U3),
ﬁve differential ampliﬁers (U4 −U8) and a comparator (U9), implemented with the
LF411. Also, there are nine signals multipliers (U10,U18) by using the AD633.
The state variables x, y, and z of system (17) are scaled up in order to avoid
problems in the system realization, which are related with the endogenous scale
factor of 10V of each of the multipliers that have been used. Therefore, the system
(17) will be changed to

The variables X, Y and Z correspond to the voltages in the outputs of the inte-
grators (U1 −U3). The circuitry in the dotted frame produces the signal of the sine
function approximated by the Taylor series expansion. Also, the signal sgn(Z) is gen-
erated by the circuitry, which is constituted of two operational ampliﬁers (U7,U8).
Normalizing the differential equations of system (22) by using t =
t
RC , it can be
seen that this system is equivalent to the system (17), with a = RVsat
10Ra , b =
R
10Rb , and
c =

Rc .
The circuit components were selected as: R = 10kΩ, Ra = 58.4kΩ, Rb =
5kΩ, Rc = 4kΩ, R1=100kΩ, R3=60kΩ, R5=1.2MΩ, R7 = 50.4MΩ, C =
10nF, while the power supplies of all active devices are ±15VDC. For the chosen
set of components, the system parameters are: a = 0.25, b = 0.2 and c = 1.3. In
Figs. 21, periodic and chaotic attractors are presented, which are obtained from Mul-
tisim on the (Y, Z) phase plane. From the comparison of these attractors with the
respective ones from the system simulation (Figs. 2, 8 and 9), it can be seen that
the circuit emulates very well the proposed system (8). Also, the phenomenon of
multi-stability is experimentally conﬁrmed. By using different initial conditions, as
initial voltages at the capacitors C1, C2 and C3, the coexisting attractors on various
planes can be observed (Figs. 22, 23 and 24), as is expected by the simulation results
presented in previous sections (Figs. 12, 19).

Conclusion
In this chapter, a new three-dimensional autonomous chaotic system with a sine func-
tion, which can display inﬁnitely many equilibria, is presented. It is the ﬁrst attempt
to present a dynamical system with hidden attractors located onto a trigonometric
curve. The proposed system has rich dynamics as conﬁrmed by using well-known
tools from nonlinear theory, such as phase portrait, Poincaré map, bifurcation dia-
gram, maximum Lyapunov exponent, and the Kaplan-Yorke fractional dimension.

with trigonometric functions. For this reason, in this chapter the replacement of the
sine function in the proposed system with its Taylor series expansion is presented. A
comparative study of the two systems presents a good agreement from a dynamical
point of view.
This investigation has driven us to design an analog circuit emulating the theo-
retical system with the Taylor series expansion and simulating its behavior by using
Multisim. The results conﬁrmed the usefulness of the proposed framework on cir-
cuitry design of sine function based on Taylor series expansion in realizing nonlinear
dynamical systems.
The ease of the speciﬁc design method, for the use of trigonometric functions in
chaotic systems with hidden attractors, makes this approach a very attractive option in
designing dynamical systems of this kind, for use in various potential applications,
such as secure communication schemes, chaotic encryption schemes, random bit
generations, and robot motion controllers.

Introduction
The ﬁrst four-dimensional (4D) hyperchaotic system was obtained by computer sim-
ulation in [1]. Due to the great potential in technological applications, such as secure
communications, control systems, and neural networks, hyperchaos generation has
become a focus research topic in the last four decades (see e.g. [1–6] as well as
references therein). Hyperchaos is characterized as a chaotic system with at least
two positive Lyapunov exponents, indicating that its dynamics are expended in two
or more directions simultaneously. Thus, hyperchaotic systems have more complex
dynamical behaviors and higher application values than common chaotic systems
such as the Lorenz system [7], Chen system [8], Lü system [9], Yang system [10],
and Hisch et al. [11], and so on. However, many hyperchaotic systems have been
introduced by adding a feedback controller and other methods to a chaotic system
with ﬁnitely many equilibria [12–14]. By now, it is still difﬁcult to generate a hyper-
chaotic system because there is not a uniﬁed and effective method to do so.
The hyperchaos theory is still in its preliminary stage, and the complex dynamics
of hyperchaotic systems have not been completely understood. Therefore, deeper
studies of hyperchaotic systems are needed. As is well known, the lowest possible
dimension of continuous-time hyperchaos is four, so 4D systems are the main interest
in investigations. Some typical examples of 4D hyperchaotic systems include the
hyperchaotic Rössler system [1], hyperchaotic Chua’s circuit [15], and hyperchaotic
modiﬁed Chua’s circuit [16]. These examples stimulate us to further research on the
properties of hyperchaos and some delicate characteristics of the new hyperchaotic

system to be studied in this chapter, which has inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria or
without any equilibria.
In chaos theory, the number of equilibria is signiﬁcant for understanding the
complicated dynamics. To date, most hyperchaotic systems reported have a ﬁnitely
many and a countable number of isolated equilibria. For 4D systems, only a few
hyperchaotic systems with a line of equilibria or without equilibria are found [17].
Recently, Chen and Yang introduced a new Lorenz-type hyperchaotic system with a
curve of equilibria [18]. To the best of our knowledge, little seems to be known about
hyperchaotic systems with inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria. Thus, it is natural and
interesting to ask whether a 4D system with inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria or
without equilibria can reveal complex dynamics like hyperchaotic, chaotic, quasi-
periodic and periodic attractors, and whether the coexistence of different attractors
is possible. Positively, the answer to these questions will be discussed in the present
paper.
Based on the number of equilibria and with the help of feedback control tech-
niques,thischapterreportsandanalyzesanew4Dhyperchaoticsystemwithinﬁnitely
many isolated equilibria or without equilibria. To further research on the new sys-
tem, some complex dynamical behaviors such as the stability of hyperbolic or non-
hyperbolic equilibria are rigorously studied via the center manifold theory. This
new hyperchaotic system displays hyperchaotic, chaotic, quasi-periodic and periodic
dynamics, which are investigated through numerical simulations, including phase
portrait, Lyapunov exponent spectrum and Poincaré map, etc. Especially, with the
exception of inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria or without equilibria, there are sev-
eral other coexisting attractors in the phase space of this new hyperchaotic system,
including the coexistence of hyperchaotic attractor and periodic attractor, chaotic
attractor and periodic attractor, quasi-periodic attractor and periodic attractor, and
hidden hyperchaotic attractor and hidden periodic attractor.

New Hyperchaotic System
This section proposes a new 4D autonomous hyperchaotic system with inﬁnitely
many isolated equilibria or without equilibria, which has nine items with one non-
linear term, but it is very different from other 4D hyperchaotic systems.
2.1
Form of the Hyperchaotic System
Consider the following two-dimensional planar linear autonomous system:
 ˙x = x −y,
˙y = cx + dy,
(1)

and the following one-dimensional autonomous system:
˙z = −a,
(2)
where a, c and d are parameters. By using the solution of the ﬁrst-order linear
equations, one can obtain the solution set of system (1) and system (2). Coupling
system (1) and system (2) together, one gets the following system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = x −y,
˙y = cx + dy,
˙z = −a + by,
(3)
where by is a coupled item, with b being the coupled divisor. It is easy to see that
system (3) has no chaos. To obtain chaos, designing a controller for the second
equation of system (3), one obtains a three-dimensional autonomous system with
only one nonlinear term, described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = x −y,
˙y = cx + dy −e sin z,
˙z = −a + by,
(4)
where abe ̸= 0, d < 0, c and d are constant parameters, a, b and e are three control
parameters, which together determine the chaotic behaviors and bifurcation of the
system. When (a, b, c, d, e) = (3, 5.9, 3, −1.5, 2), system (4) has inﬁnitely many
isolated equilibria:

where k ∈Z = {0, ±1, ±2, . . .}. The three Lyapunov exponents are
λLE1 = 0.4562,
λLE2 = 0.0000,
λLE3 = −0.9763.
and the Lyapunov dimension of the corresponding chaotic attractor is DL = 2.467.
Moreover, numerical simulations indicate that system (4) indeed has a chaotic attrac-
tor when (a, b, c, d, e) = (3, 5.9, 3, −1.5, 2), as depicted in Fig. 1.
It is well known that the lowest dimension of an autonomous system for the
generation of hyperchaos is four, and hyperchaotic systems have more complex
dynamical behaviors and higher application values than chaotic systems. Therefore,
4D hyperchaotic systems deserve more attention. Based on chaotic system (4) with
inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria, we further study the complicated dynamics of 4D
hyperchaotic systems.
By adding a linear feedback controller to the ﬁrst equation of system (4), a new
4D hyperchaotic system is obtained, as

where the parameters a, b, c, d, e and f satisfy abef ̸= 0 and d < 0. Under certain
parameters conditions, system (5) has inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria or without
equilibria.
When (a, b, c, d, e, f ) = (3, 3, 5, −3, −15, 3.7), system (5) has a hyperchaotic
attractor, with phase portraits shown in Fig. 2.
The corresponding four Lyapunov exponents of this hyperchaotic system are
λLE1 = 0.3593,
λLE2 = 0.1511,
λLE3 = 0.0000,
λLE4 = −2.5105.
The Lyapunov dimension is characterized by its Lyapunov exponents, i.e.

Fig. 2 Three-dimensional projections of the hyperchaotic attractor of system (5): (a, b, c, d,
e, f ) = (3, 3, 5, −3, −15, 3.7)
λ1 = −7.9896, λ2 = 4.9091, λ3 = 0.5402 + 1.9666i, λ4 = 0.5402 −1.9666i.
Thus, E1k and E2k are saddle-focus points, which have a one-dimensional stable
manifold and a three-dimensional unstable manifold.
When (a, b, c, d, e, f ) = (11, 3, 5, −3, −10, 2.74), system (5) has no equilibria.
But, system (5) has a hidden hyperchaotic attractor, and the phase portraits are shown
in Fig. 3.
The corresponding Lyapunov exponents of the hidden hyperchaotic attractor are
λLE1 = 0.3002,
λLE2 = 0.0399,
λLE3 = 0.0000,
λLE4 = −2.3401.
and the Lyapunov dimension is DL = 3.1453, which means that the hidden hyper-
chaotic attractor has a fractal dimension.
Remark 20.1 When the system (5) has inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria or without
equilibria, it can generate a hyperchaotic attractor or a hidden hyperchaotic attractor.
To the best of our knowledge, this situation has not been discussed in other studies.

Dissipativity and Sensitive Dependence on the Initial
Value
This subsection examines the dynamical behaviors of the hyperchaotic system (5),
including dissipativity and sensitive dependence on the initial value.
2.2.1
Dissipativity
The divergence of system (5) is
∇V = ∂˙x
∂x + ∂˙y
∂y + ∂˙z
∂z + ∂˙w
∂w = d + 1,
so the system will be dissipative if condition d < −1 is satisﬁed, and the exponential
contraction rate: dV
dt = (d + 1)V for any values of a, b, c, e and f . That is, a
volume element V0 is contracted to V0e(d+1)t in time t, indicating that the volume
of the phase space is shrinking to zero as t →∞at an exponential rate: (1 + d),
which is independent of the state variables x, y, z and w. Therefore, when d < −1,
all orbits of system (5) ultimately arrive to an attractor.

Sensitive Dependence on the Initial Value
An essential feature of chaotic dynamics is the sensitive dependence on initial con-
ditions. Chaos has sensitive dependence on the initial conditions, which is known
as “butterﬂy effect” and the self-similarity of the time scale. For its sensitive depen-
dence on initial values, chaos can be applied to pattern recognition of the ones with
extremely small differences. Figure 4 shows the time-sequence diagram about the
abscissa under different initial values in two groups.

The following theorem is the stability of inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria E1k and

Otherwise, equilibria E1k is non-hyperbolic or is unstable.

Otherwise, equilibria E1k is non-hyperbolic or is unstable.

Under the condition (7), one gets

Δ4 > 0.
According to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, all solutions of the characteristic polyno-

stable. Or else, if conditions (7) is not satisﬁed, some roots of the polynomial (10)
have non-negative real parts, i.e. zero or positive real parts, then equilibria E1k is
non-hyperbolic or is unstable.
(ii) For be > 0, the corresponding characteristic equation is
λ4 + a1λ3 + a2λ2 + a3λ + a4 = 0,
(11)
where a1 = −(1 + d), a2 = f + d + c + m, a3 = −m −f d and a4 = f m. From
the condition (8), it follows that
Δ1 > 0,
Δ2 > 0,
Δ3 > 0,
Δ4 > 0.
According to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, similarly to the proof of case (i) above,
one obtains conclusion (ii).
Similarly to proof of case (i), one can obtain the conclusions of (iii) and (iv). ⊓⊔
Theorem 20.3 Let parameters a, b, d and e satisfy T < 1 i.e. a2d2 < b2e2. Then
(i) For be < 0, E2k is local asymptotically stable, if and only if the following
conditions (8) hold. Otherwise, equilibrium E2k is non-hyperbolic or is unstable.
(ii) For be > 0, E2k is local asymptotically stable, if and only if the conditions
(7) hold. Otherwise, equilibrium E2k is non-hyperbolic or is unstable.

(iii) For be < 0, E3k is local asymptotically stable, if and only if the conditions
(8) hold. Otherwise, equilibrium E3k is non-hyperbolic or is unstable.
(iv) For be > 0, E3k is local asymptotically stable, if and only if the condition
(7) hold. Otherwise, equilibrium E3k is non-hyperbolic or is unstable.
Proof Similarly to proof of Theorem 20.2, Theorem 20.3 is veriﬁed.
3.2.2
The Non-hyperbolic Case with T = 1
It is easy to see that T = 1 implies a2d2 = b2e2. Therefore, the characteristic equa-
tion of system (5) at equilibria E1k is

λ3 −(1 + d)λ2 + ( f + d + c)λ −d f

implying that the equilibrium E1k is non-hyperbolic.

following approximative system:

(14)
Since the Jacobi matrix and characteristic equation are the same as system (5) at
equilibria E1k and system (14) at the origin E0, taking advantage of the characteristic
equation of system (14) at E0, one can get the characteristic equation of system (5)
at E1k. Note that the characteristic equation of system (14) at E0 is (10). Thus, when
d = be

By using the center manifold theorem, one obtains the following stability of the non-
hyperbolic equilibria of system (5) for the case of ad −be = 0. When ad + be = 0,
the discussion is similar to that of the case ad −be = 0.
Theorem 20.4 Let (a, b, c, d, e, f ) ∈Ω0 and d = be
a . Then, system (5) has non-
hyperbolic isolated equilibria E1k, at which the linearized system has a zero eigen-
value. Furthermore, system (5) has a three-dimensional stable manifold, and the
non-hyperbolic equilibrium E1k is unstable.
Proof To show the stability of equilibria E1k of system (5), we only need to prove
the stability of the equilibrium E0 of system (15). Since λ2, λ3 and λ4 satisfy (16),
that is,
g(λ) = λ3 + c1λ2 + c2λ + c3 = 0,
where c1 = −

The parameter condition Ω0 means the Routh-Huiwitz conditions Δ1 > 0, Δ2 > 0
and Δ3 > 0. Therefore, all solutions of equation (16) have negative real parts.
To show the stability of equilibrium E0 of system (15), the proof is divided into
the following two cases.
Case I. Δ = −c2
1c2
2 + 4c3
1c3 + 4c3
2 −18c1c2c3 + 27c2
3 < 0.
In this case, the equation λg(λ) = 0 has eigenvalue λ1 = 0, and three different
negative real eigenvalues λ2, λ3 and λ4 [19], with corresponding eigenvectors
ξ1 = (0, 0, 1, 0)T ,
ξ2 = (λ2(aλ2 −be), acλ2, abc, −f (aλ2 −be))T ,
ξ3 = (λ3(aλ3 −be), acλ3, abc, −f (aλ3 −be))T ,
ξ4 = (λ4(aλ4 −be), acλ4, abc, −f (aλ4 −be))T .

According to the center manifold theory, the stability of equilibrium E0 can be
determined by studying the ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equations on its center
manifold, which can be represented as a graph over the variable u, as follows:

and δ sufﬁciently small.
Consider the center manifold
v = V (u) = v1u2 + v2u3 + O(u4),
p = P(u) = p1u2 + p2u3 + O(u4),
q = Q(u) = q1u2 + q2u3 + O(u4).
(18)
Substituting expressions (18) into system (17), one obtains
v1 =
−(be −aλ3)(be −aλ4)
2a2bcλ2(λ2 −λ3)(λ2 −λ4),
v2 =

q2 =

2a3bcλ2(λ2 −λ4)λ3λ2
4(λ3 −λ4).
Therefore,
v =

(be −aλ3)(be −aλ4)ϕ1

q =

(be −aλ2)(be −aλ3)ϕ3
2a3bcλ2(λ2 −λ4)λ3λ2
4(λ3 −λ4)u3 + O(u4).
(19)
Substituting the expressions (19) into system (17), one gets the restricted vector ﬁeld
of system (17) on its center manifold
˙u = −a
2u2 + h1u3 + O(u4),
(20)
where
h1 = (be −aλ3)(be −aλ4)
2λ2(λ2 −λ3)(λ2 −λ4) −(be −aλ2)(be −aλ4)
2λ3(λ2 −λ3)(λ3 −λ4) −
(be −aλ2)(be −aλ3)
2λ4(λ2 −λ4)(−λ3 + λ4).
From the assumption of a ̸= 0 and (20), it follows that E1k is unstable.
Case II. Δ = −c2

2 + 4c3
1c3 + 4c3
2 −18c1c2c3 + 27c2

In this case, the equation λg(λ) = 0 has eigenvalues λ1 = 0, negative real root
λ2, and conjugate complex roots with negative real parts λ3 and λ4 [19]. Let λ3,4 =
β ± iρ. Then, the corresponding eigenvectors are

with
ϕ(u, v, p, q) = [u(β2 + ρ2) + b(pβ −qρ + acv(β2 + ρ2))]2.
Repeating the same process as in Case I, one can show that the restricted vector ﬁeld
of system (21) on its center manifold becomes the following form:
˙u = −a
2u2 + b2e2 −2abeβ + a2(β2 + ρ2) −a(be −2aβ)λ2

(22)
Therefore, it follows from a ̸= 0 that E1k is unstable.
Remark 20.2 Similarly to that in the discussion of Theorem 20.4, one can establish
relevant stable conclusions for equilibria E2k, E3k and E4k of system (5), which are
omitted here for brevity.

Global Dynamics of the Hyperchaotic System
For a common chaotic or hyperchaotic system, its complicated dynamics are gener-
ally produced by the bifurcations at equilibria. However, for the hyperchaotic systems
with inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria or without equilibria, the equilibria of these
systems are difﬁcult to study to gain understanding of the complicated dynamics
based on theoretical analysis. Thus, the methods of numerical analysis are particu-
larly important for studying these systems. With the exception of the hyperchaotic
attractor, many other complicated dynamics of system (5) are discovered by detailed
numerical analysis. This section chooses some groups of ﬁxed values of the param-
eters a, b, c, d and e, meanwhile varying the parameter f . With the help of phase
portraits, Lyapunov exponents, Poincaré maps and bifurcation diagrams, it is possible
to investigate the complicated dynamical characteristics of system (5) in detail.
4.1
Complex Dynamics when T > 1
When the parameters a, b, d and e satisfying T > 1 implies that a2d2 > b2e2. It
follows from Theorem 20.1 that system (5) has no equilibria. Fix (a, b, c, d, e) =
(11, 3, 5, −3, −10) and vary f ∈[2, 6], the corresponding Lyapunov exponent spec-
trum is shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding bifurcation diagram is given in Fig.
5b. Therefore, Fig. 5 show that system (5) may have hyperchaotic attractor, chaotic
attractor and periodic attractor under proper parameters.
In particular, let (a, b, c, d, e, f ) = (11, 3, 5, −3, −10, 3.77). Then, the corre-
sponding Lyapunov exponents are
λLE1 = 0.2752,

When (a, b, c, d, e) = (10, 3, 5, −3, −15) and f ∈[0.5, 4.5], it follows from Theo-

Figure 19a displays the Lyapunov exponent spectrum of system (5), and Fig. 19b

These computation and simulation results demonstrate that system (5) may have
complex dynamics such as periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic and hyperchaotic attrac-
tors. For some typical values of f , the corresponding Lyapunov exponents are shown
in Table 2.
In particular, for (a, b, c, d, e, f ) = (10, 3, 5, −3, −10, 4.40), system (5) has a

4.4
Coexisting Attractors
According to the analysis of Sects. 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, in addition to inﬁnitely many isolated
equilibria or no equilibria, system (5) can exhibit a lot of complex dynamics, like

515
hyperchaotic, chaotic, periodic, and quasi-periodic motions. Now, in this subsection,
under some proper parameter conditions, several coexisting attractors of system (5)
are discussed.
The coexisting solutions of system (5), which satisfy different initial conditions,
may possess very different dynamical behaviors. The following Sects. 4.4.1, 4.4.2,
4.4.3 show the coexisting attractors of system (5) with T = 1, but Sect. 4.4.4 shows
the coexisting hidden attractors with T > 1.
4.4.1
Hyperchaotic Attractor and Periodic Attractor
Let (a, b, c, d, e, f ) = (10, 3, 5, −3, −10, 4.40) and choose the initial value (0.1,
1.5, 3.6, −1). Then, the corresponding Lyapunov exponents are
λLE1 = 0.1270,
λLE2 = 0.0590,
λLE3 = −0.0001,
λLE4 = −2.1857,
which demonstrates that the attractor is hyperchaotic. The corresponding Lyapunov
dimension is DL = 3.0851. The projection of this attractor onto the x-y-w space is
depicted in Fig. 23a, and the Poincaré maps on the y-w section are depicted in Fig.
24a.
Under the same parameters, and choosing the initial condition (−1, −1, −1,
−1.05), which implies that system (5) has a periodic attractor, the corresponding
Lyapunov exponents are
λLE1 = 0.0001,
λLE2 = −0.0567,
λLE3 = −0.0573,
λLE4 = −1.8857.
The projection of the periodic attractor onto the three-dimension space is shown
in Fig. 23b, and the Poincaré maps on the y-w section are depicted in Fig. 24b.
Therefore, for parameters (a, b, c, d, e, f ) = (10, 3, 5, −3, −10, 4.40), system
(5) can exhibit complex dynamics with coexisting hyperchaotic attractor and periodic
attractor, as shown in Fig. 23c.
4.4.2
Chaotic Attractor and Periodic Attractor
Fixing (a, b, c, d, e, f ) = (10, 3, 5, −3, −10, 2.11) and choosing the initial value
(0.1, 1.5, 3.6, −1), system (5) has a chaotic attractor with projection into the x-y-w
space shown in Fig. 25a and the Poincaré maps on the section

(x, y, z, w) ∈R4 |
x = 0} displayed in Fig. 26a. Moreover, the corresponding Lyapunov exponents are
λLE1 = 0.0596,
λLE2 = 0.0000,
λLE3 = −0.1311,
λLE4 = −1.9283.
Under the same parameters, for the initial value (−1, −1, −1, −1.05), the corre-
sponding Lyapunov exponents are

Conclusions and Discussions
In this chapter, a 4D hyperchaotic system with inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria
or without equilibria has been constructed by adding a linear feedback controller to
a 3D chaotic system. The local dynamics of the new hyperchaotic system, such as
the stability of equilibria in the hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic case, are analyzed by
using the center manifold theorem. For the global dynamics, the numerical analysis
show that the new system with inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria or without equi-
libria can reveal hyperchaotic, chaotic, quasi-periodic and periodic dynamics. The
corresponding hyperchaotic attractor and other attractors are numerically veriﬁed
through investigating phase portraits, bifurcations, Lyapunov exponents, Poincaré
sections, and fractional dimensions. The system can generate hyperchaotic attractor
or hidden hyperchaotic attractor when system has inﬁnitely many isolated equilib-
ria or has no equilibria, under some proper parameter values. In particular, there are
four kinds of coexistence of differential attractors coexisting for some parameters: (i)
hyperchaotic attractor and periodic attractor, (ii) chaotic attractor and periodic attrac-
tor, (iii) quasi-periodic attractor and periodic attractor, and (iv) hidden hyperchaotic
attractor and hidden periodic attractor.
In order to better understand four-dimensional hyperchaotic systems, there are a
few problems needed to be further investigated:
(i) What is the hyperchaotic formation mechanism of four-dimensional
autonomous systems with no equilibria?

521
(ii) What is the mechanism of hyperchaotic systems with inﬁnitely many isolated
equilibria?
(iii) How to change a 4D autonomous system from having no equilibria to having
inﬁnitely many isolated equilibria?
(iv) How to construct the coexisting mechanism of periodic attractor, quasi-
periodic attractor, chaotic attractor and hyperchaotic attractor of a general hyper-
chaotic system without equilibria?
These problems in the study of a hyperchaotic system with inﬁnitely many isolated
equilibria or without equilibria may make the hyperchaos theories richer for more
practical applications. It is hoped that the investigation of this chapter will shed some
lights onto more systematic studies of 4D hyperchaotic systems.

Introduction to Piecewise-Smooth Systems and
Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems
There are a lot of interesting phenomena in nature, society and engineering that
are closely related to the description of piecewise-smooth dynamical systems [1–
6]. Among these are population dynamics, such as food chain dynamics and generic
regulation networks in biology, switching power converters and relay systems, differ-
ent types of pulse-width modulated control systems, mechanical systems, including
legged robots, digital electronics and economic business cycles, to name just a few.
Piecewise-smooth dynamical systems can exhibit rich dynamics and bifurcations
similar to smooth dynamical systems, and more interestingly display some unique
features like border-collision, discontinuous bifurcation and periodic adding due to
non-smoothness and discontinuity [1]. Therefore, investigation of various dynamics
and bifurcations in piecewise-smooth dynamical systems is of great signiﬁcance
from both practical and theoretical points of view.
The ﬁrst goal in studying piecewise-smooth dynamical systems is clearly on the
piecewise-linear systems, or more generally, piecewise-afﬁne systems. There are

two reasons for studying this class of piecewise-smooth dynamical systems. First,
the piecewise-afﬁne systems can display almost all of dynamical behaviors observed
in smooth systems and are of fundamental theoretical signiﬁcance in understanding
general piecewise-smooth dynamical systems. Second, piecewise-afﬁne systems can
be investigated analytically by means of quantitatively and qualitatively approaches
because of their piecewise nature.
Evenfromthesmoothdynamicalsystemperspective,itisworthyofmakingefforts
to investigate the dynamics of piecewise-afﬁne systems, especially complex dynam-
ics such as chaos. An intensive investigation on the dynamics of piecewise-afﬁne
systems can also give some deep insights into the dynamics of smooth dynamical
systems. Because singular cycles such as homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycles
are of great importance in the study of nonlinear dynamical systems, due to their close
connections with global bifurcations and chaotic behaviors of dynamical systems in
terms of the Šil’nikov theory, in this chapter we focus on piecewise-afﬁne systems
and present some recent progress in the investigation of the existence of homoclinic
orbits and heteroclinic cycles, and an extension of the well-known Šil’nikov theory
to studying chaos in piecewise-afﬁne systems.
This chapter is organized as follows. In the rest of this section, we review some
notions and notations of piecewise-afﬁne systems. In Sect.2, we present recent results
on the existence of homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycles in several subclasses
of piecewise-afﬁne systems. Section3 offers a Šil’nikov-type theory for piecewise-
afﬁne systems. In Sect.4, we present a gallery of chaotic piecewise-afﬁne systems
with computer simulations. In the last section, we give a brief summary and propose
several topics that are of great value and common interest in the opinion of the
authors.
Now, let us prepare some preliminaries of piecewise-afﬁne systems.
Consider the following n-dimensional piecewise-afﬁne systems with two zones:
˙x =

Ax + a, c⊺x < d
Bx + b, c⊺x ≥d,
(1)
where x = (x1, . . . , xn)⊺∈Rn is a vector of state variables. a = (a1, . . . , an)⊺, b =
(b1, . . . , bn)⊺and c = (c1, . . . , cn)⊺are all constant vectors in Rn, d is a constant,
and A and B are invertible matrices.
Let
Σ = {x ∈Rn | c⊺x = d}.
Here, Σ is usually called a discontinuity set, discontinuity boundary or, some-
times, a switching manifold [1, 3].
Let
Σ−= {x ∈Rn | c⊺x < d},
Σ+ = {x ∈Rn | c⊺x > d}.
In system (1), let the equilibrium point of the subsystem

be denoted by p with p = −A−1a ∈Σ−, and the equilibrium point of subsystem
˙x = Bx + b
(3)
be denoted by q with q = −B−1b.
Let
p = (x1p, . . . , xnp)⊺,
q = (x1q, . . . , xnq)⊺.
Without loss of generality, assume that
A = PJAP−1,
(4)
B = QJBQ−1,
(5)
where JA and JB are the Jordan normal forms of matrices A and B, the invertible
matrices P and Q are given as follows:
P =
ζ1, . . . , ζn

,
with ζ1, . . . , ζ3 ∈Rn being generalized eigenvectors of matrix A, and
Q =
ξ1, . . . , ξn

,
with ξ1, . . . , ξ3 ∈R3 being generalized eigenvectors of matrix B.
Denote by ΦA(t, x0) and ΦB(t, y0) the solutions of system (2) and (3), with initial
conditions ΦA(0, x0) = x0 and ΦB(0, y0) = y0, respectively. We obtain that
ΦA(t, x0) = eAt(x0 −p) + p,
(6)
ΦB(t, y0) = eBt(y0 −q) + q.

Existence of Homoclinic Orbits and Heteroclinic Cycles
In this section, we provide several results about the existence of homoclinic orbits
and heteroclinic cycles that cross the switching manifold transversally at two points
in 3-dimensional or 4-dimensional piecewise-afﬁne systems.
2.1

Existence of Homoclinic Orbits to a Saddle-Focus in
3-Dimensional Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems
Without loss of generality, this section considers system (1) with n = 3, c =
(−1, 0, 0)⊺and d = 0, as follows:
˙x =

Ax + a,
x1 > 0,
Bx + b,
x1 ≤0,
x ∈R3,
(8)
where the eigenvalues of A are α ± iβ, λ, with α, β > 0, λ < 0 and the eigenvalues
of B are λ1, λ2, λ3 with λi ̸= 0, for i = 1, 2, 3.
In (4) and (5), suppose that
JA =
⎛
⎝

and JB has the following three forms:

Moreover, for

y0 = q + (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)

from (6) and (7), we have
ΦA(t, x0) = p + (ζ1, ζ2, ζ3)

From the expression of A in (4), the stable subspace Es(p) and the unstable
subspace Eu(p) are shown as follows:
Es(p) = {p + kζ3 | k ∈R},
(14)
Eu(p) = {p + k1ζ1 + k2ζ2 | k1, k2 ∈R}.
Suppose that p1 = Es(p) ∩Σ, L = Eu(p) ∩Σ ̸= ∅, then we get
p1 =

0, x2p −ζ32
ζ31
x1p, x3p −ζ33
ζ31
x1p
⊺
,
L = {x = p + k1ζ1 + k2ζ2 | x1p + k1ζ11 + k2ζ21 = 0, k1, k2 ∈R}.
For p1 and a point p2 ∈L, let
p1 −q = Q(ρ1, ρ2, ρ3)⊺,
(15)
p2 −q = Q(σ1, σ2, σ3)⊺.
(16)
For the existence of a homoclinic orbit of system (1), satisfying all the above
assumptions with n = 3, we have the following theorem [7].
Theorem 21.1 System (8) has a homoclinic orbit to the equilibrium point p, which
crosses Σ transversally at two points, if and only if there exist real numbers k1, k2

In addition, the homoclinic orbit crosses Σ transversally at p1 and p2 (Fig.1).
Proof of Theorem 21.1 If system (8) has a homoclinic orbit to p and the homoclinic
orbit crosses Σ transversally at two points, then from the deﬁnition of a homoclinic
orbit, one point is p1 = Es(p) ∩Σ and the other one is located in line L.
System (8) has a homoclinic orbit to p and the homoclinic orbit crosses Σ transver-
sally at p1 and p2 if and only if system (8) satisﬁes the following conditions:
(1) p2 ∈L.
(2) The positive orbit of p0 satisﬁes {ΦA(t, p1) | t > 0} ⊂Σ−.
(3) The negative orbit of p1 satisﬁes {ΦA(t, p2) | t < 0} ⊂Σ−.

Notice that condition (I) in Theorem 21.1 is condition (1) here.
Consider the expression of Es(p) in (14). Then, {ΦA(t, p1) | t > 0} is a line
connecting p1 and p. From p1 ∈Σ, p ∈Σ−, we have
{ΦA(t, p1) | t > 0} ⊂Σ−,
which means that condition (2) holds.
Let
f (t) = (1, 0, 0)⊺(ΦA(−t, p2) −p).
Then, {ΦA(t, p2) | t < 0} ⊂Σ−if and only if f (t) > −x1p holds for t > 0.
From (9) and condition (I), we get
f (t) =

(17)
where

From (17), we have

f ′(t) =

x2
1p + (k1ζ21 −k2ζ22)2e−αt[−α sin(−βt + θ) −β cos(−βt + θ)],

and
f ′′(t) =

x2
1p + (k1ζ21 −k2ζ22)2e−αt[(α2 −β2) sin(−βt + θ) + 2αβ cos(−βt + θ)].
Considering (17) and (18), we have
f (0) = −x1p,
f ′(0) = αx1p −β(k1ζ21 −k2ζ11).
Since f (0) = −x1p, for f (t) > −x1p (t > 0), we must have f ′(0) > 0, which is
the ﬁrst inequality in condition (III) in Theorem 21.1. In addition, combining these
with Fig.2, f (t) > −x1p holds for t > 0 if and only if f (T ′) > −x1p holds for the
local minimum point T ′ ∈(0, 2π
β ).
From (18), we have
f ′(t) = 0 ⇔tan(−βt + θ) = −β

Equivalently, we have either

Considering (21), {ΦA(t, p2) | t < 0} ⊂Σ−if and only if condition (III) in The-
orem 21.1 holds. That is, condition (3) holds if and only if condition (III) in Theorem
21.1 holds.
Next, consider the veriﬁcation of condition (4). If system (8) has a homoclinic
orbit to the equilibrium point p, then from the above discussions, we must have
ΦB(T, p2) = p1 for some constant T > 0 and {ΦB(t, p2) | t ∈(0, T )} ⊂Σ+.
Assume that for a constant T > 0, ΦB(T, p2) = p1. From (9), it is the equality
of condition (II) in Theorem 21.1. In the following, we prove that
{ΦB(t, p2) | t ∈(0, T )} ⊂Σ+
if and only if condition (II) in Theorem 21.1 holds.
To do so, consider (9) and let
gi(t) = (1, 0, 0)⊺ΦB(t, p1)
f or
JB = Ji, i = 1, 2, 3.
Then, for JB = Ji,
{ΦB(t, p2) | t ∈(0, T )} ⊂Σ+
if and only if gi(t) < 0 for t ∈(0, T ), i = 1, 2, 3.
In view of condition (I) in Theorem 21.1 and (9), we get
gi(0) = gi(T ) = 0,
g′
i(0) = (ξ11, ξ21, ξ31)⊺Ji

i(T ) = (ξ11, ξ21, ξ31)⊺Ji
⎛
⎝

⎠, i = 1, 2, 3.
Since gi(0) = gi(T ) = 0, to have gi(t) < 0 for t ∈(0, T ), we must have g′
i(0) <
0, g′
i(T ) > 0, i.e. the inequalities in condition (II) in Theorem 21.1.
Now, we prove that gi(t) < 0 holds for t ∈(0, T ) if condition (II) in Theorem
21.1 holds. We only study g1(t). Functions g2(t) and g3(t) can be studied by the
same method.
From (9), we get
g1(t) = x1q + ξ11σ1eλ1t + ξ21σ2eλ2t + ξ31σ3eλ3t,
g′
1(t) = ξ11σ1λ1eλ1t + ξ21σ2λ2eλ2t + ξ31σ3λ3eλ3t
= eλ1t(ξ11σ1λ1 + ξ21σ2λ2e(λ2−λ1)t + ξ31σ3λ3e(λ3−λ1)t).

Then,
g′
1(t) = eλ1th(t),
h(0) < 0,
h(T ) > 0,
and
h′(t) = e(λ2−λ1)t[ξ21σ2λ2(λ2 −λ1) + ξ31σ3λ3(λ3 −λ1)e(λ3−λ2)t].
(22)
Since h(0)h(T ) < 0, h(t) = 0 has a solution in (0, T ) from the Mean Value
Theorem and h′(t) is not equal to zero. In view of (22), h′(t) = 0 has one solution
at most.
If h′(t) = 0 has no solutions in (0, T ), then from h(0) < 0 and h(T ) > 0, we
concludethat h′(t) > 0 and h(t) = 0 hasauniquesolutionin(0, T );thatis, g′
1(t) = 0
has a unique solution in (0, T ).
If the unique solution t′ of h′(t) = 0 is in (0, T ), then we have either
h′(t) < 0 for
t < t′
and
h′(t) > 0 for
t > t′,
(23)
or
h′(t) > 0 for
t < t′
and
h′(t) < 0 for
t > t′.
(24)
For h(0) < 0, h(T ) > 0, the ﬁgure of h(t) satisfying (23) is shown in Fig.3 and
the ﬁgure of h(t) satisfying (24) is shown in Fig.4.
Combining the above with Fig.3, h(t) = 0 has a unique solution in (0, T ); that
is, g′
1(t) = 0 has a unique solution in (0, T ).
In conclusion, g′
1(t) = 0 has a unique solution in (0, T ). Moreover, from g1(0) =
g1(T ) = 0, g′
1(0) < 0 and g′
1(T ) > 0, we have g1(t) < 0 for t ∈(0, T ). The ﬁgure
of g1(t) is shown as Fig.4.

Moreover, from inequalities in condition (II) and the ﬁrst inequality in condition
(III) in Theorem 21.1, we have
(1, 0, 0)⊺(Ap1 + a) = −λx1p > 0,
(1, 0, 0)⊺(Ap2 + a) = −α1x1p + β1(k1ζ21 −k2ζ11) < 0,

(1, 0, 0)⊺(Bp2 + b) = (ξ11, ξ21, ξ31)J(σ1, σ2, σ3)⊺< 0.
Then, condition (5) holds.
In conclusion, conditions (1)–(5) hold if and only if conditions in Theorem 21.1
hold. The proof of Theorem 21.1 is thus completed.

Es(p) = {p + k1ζ1 + k2ζ2 | k1, k2 ∈R},
Eu(p) = {p + k3ζ3 + k4ζ4 | k3, k4 ∈R}.
Assume that
L1 = Es(p) ∩Σ ̸= ∅,
L2 = Eu(q) ∩Σ ̸= ∅.
Then, we have
L1 = {p + k1ζ1 + k2ζ2 | k1ζ11 + k2ζ21 = −x1p},
L2 = {p + k3ζ3 + k4ζ4 | k3ζ31 + k4ζ41 = −x1p}.

for the existence of a homoclinic orbit of system (25), satisfying all the above assump-
tions, we have the following theorem [8].

Theorem 21.2 System (25) has a homoclinic orbit to the equilibrium point p, which

Existence of Homoclinic Orbits to an Equilibrium Point with a
Pair of Complex Eigenvalues and Two Real Eigenvalues in
4-Dimensional Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems
This subsection considers system (1), with n = 4, a = b = 0, and c = (0, 1, 0, 1)⊺,
as follows:
˙x =
Ax, x2 + x4 ≤1,

The following theorem [9] provides some sufﬁcient conditions on the existence
of homoclinic orbits in system (26).
Theorem 21.3 Suppose that αρ < 0, δρ > 0 in system (26). Then, there exists a
homoclinic orbit Γ connecting the origin to itself and intersecting the discontinuity
manifold Σ : x2 + x4 = 1 at two points p0 = (0, 1, 0, 0)⊺and q0 = (0, 0, 0, 1)⊺.
Proof By direct calculations, we get
ΦA(t, x0) =
⎛
⎜⎜⎝

(28)
Note that, when α < 0, ρ > 0, δ > 0 (α > 0, ρ < 0, δ < 0), by (27) we obtain
ΦA(t, p0) →0 as t →+∞(t →−∞) and ΦA(t, q0) →0 as t →−∞(t →
+∞). In addition to this, by (27), we also have eαt cos βt < 1 (eρt < 1) when t > 0
and eρt < 1 (eαt cos βt < 1) when t < 0, i.e., ΦA(t, p0), t ∈(0, +∞)(t ∈(−∞, 0))
and ΦA(t, q0), t ∈(−∞, 0)(t ∈(0, +∞)) will stay in the action area of the half sys-
tem ˙x = Ax.
Moreover, by (28), we have ΦB(π/2δ, q0) = p0 and sin δt + cos δt > 1 when δ >
0, t ∈(0, π
2δ), and cos δt −sin δt > 1 when δ < 0, t ∈(0, −π
2δ), i.e., the trajectory

of the half system ˙x = Bx connecting the points p0 and q0 always stays in its action
area.
So, the statements are proved.

The stable manifolds W s(p), W s(q) and the unstable manifolds W u(p), W u(q)
are shown as follows:
W s(p) = {p + x | x ∈span{ζ3}},
W s(q) = {q + x | x ∈span{ξ3}},
W u(p) = {p + x | x ∈span{ζ1, ζ2}},
W u(q) = {q + x | x ∈span{ξ1, ξ2}}.
Suppose that the intersections W u(p) ∩Σ, W s(p) ∩Σ, W u(q) ∩Σ and W s(q) ∩
Σ are not empty. Then, W u(p) ∩Σ is a line and W s(p) ∩Σ is a point, W u(q) ∩Σ is
a line and W s(q) ∩Σ is a point. Let p0 = W s(p) ∩Σ and q0 = W s(q) ∩Σ. Then,
we have

W u(q) = {q + l3ξ3 + l4ξ4 | l3,l4 ∈R}.
Suppose that
L1 = W s(p) ∩Σ,
L2 = W s(q) ∩Σ,
L3 = W u(p) ∩Σ,
L4 = W u(q) ∩Σ,
L1 ∩L4 ̸= ∅,
L2 ∩L3 ̸= ∅.
Thus, Li is clearly a line for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
For the existence of a heteroclinic cycle, we have the following theorem [11].
Theorem 21.5 System (30) has a heteroclinic cycle connecting equilibrium points p
and q, which crosses Σ transversally at two points, if and only if there exist constant
real numbers ki, li, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, such that the following conditions hold:
(I)
p1 = p + k1ζ1 + k2ζ2 = q + l3ξ3 + l4ξ4 ∈Σ,
p2 = p + k3ζ3 + k4ζ4 = q + l1ξ1 + l2ξ2 ∈Σ.

In addition, the heteroclinic cycle crosses Σ transversally at p1 and p2.
Proof The proof of this theorem is similar to that for Theorems 21.1–21.4, but more
complex and skillful, referring to [11] for details.
In Theorems 21.1–21.5, we study the existence of homoclinic orbits or hetero-
clinic cycles in various 3-dimensional or 4-dimensional piecewise-afﬁne systems.
The conditions in these theorems are a bit complicated but straightforward. The
methods for the proofs of these theorems are based on conventional analyses. In
fact, from these proofs, it is not hard to see that the key of these results is to ensure
that the space positional relations among the stable manifolds of subsystems, the

Singular Cycles and Chaos in Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems
541
unstable manifolds of subsystems and the switching manifold, all satisfy some con-
ditions. Notice that the stable (unstable) manifolds and the switching manifold are
all lower-dimensional than the state variables of the systems.
Along the same way, in the next subsection, we will further study the existence of
more types of heteroclinic cycles in some 3-dimensional piecewise-afﬁne systems
based on the plane positional relations between a trajectory of a plane linear system
and a ﬁxed line. Some more concise necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the
existence of three types of heteroclinic cycles will be obtained.
2.2.3
The Existence of Three Types of Heteroclinic Cycles in a Class of
3-Dimensional Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems Based on Two Results
from Planar Linear Systems
All contents of this subsection are taken from [12].
We ﬁrstly introduce two results on the planar linear system given by
˙x = A0x,
(31)
where x ∈R2. For x0 ∈R2, we denote the positive semi-orbit of x0 by O+(x0), i.e.,
O+(x0) = {Φ(t, x0)|t > 0} = {exp(A0t)x0|t > 0},
where Φ(t, ·) denotes the ﬂow generated by (31).
Let L = {x ∈R2|kT x = c}, with 0 < c ∈R and 0 ̸= k = (k1, k2)T ∈R2. Then,
L is a straight line not passing through the origin, which divides the plane into three
disjoint subsets, L, L+ and L−, where
L+ = {x ∈R2|kT x > c}, L−= {x ∈R2|kT x < c}.
Obviously, the origin is in L−.
Lemma 1 For system (31), suppose that the eigenvalues of A0 are given by μ1,2 < 0
and x0 ∈L. Then,
O+(x0) ⊂L−if and only if kT A0x0 ≤0.
Proof Here, we only present the proof of Lemma 1 under the assumption that A0 is
given by N :
μ1 0
0 μ2

N−1 with N being an invertible matrix.
If A0 is given by N
μ1 1
0 μ2

N−1 with μ1 = μ2, the proof is similar.
(a) Proof of necessity
Let g(t) = kT exp(A0t)x0. Obviously, g is a smooth function with
g′(t) = kT exp(A0t)A0x0.
(32)

542
X.-S. Yang et al.
Moreover, g(0) = c and g(t) < c(t > 0) imply g′(0) = kT A0x0 ≤0.
(b) Proof of sufﬁciency
From (32), we have g′(t) = kT N
eμ1t
0
0
eμ2t

N−1A0x0, which is actually a linear
combination of eμ1t and eμ2t; that is,
g′(t) = σ1eμ1t + σ2eμ2t,
(33)
where σ1,2 ∈R. Obviously, g(t) →0 and g′(t) →0 as t →+∞.
Note that σ1 and σ2 are not both zero. In fact, if σ1 and σ2 are both zero, i.e.,
g′(t) ≡0, then N
 eμ1t
0
0
eμ2t

N−1A0x0 ∈L for any t ∈R, which is contradictory
to the fact that N
eμ1t
0
0
eμ2t

N−1A0x0 →0 as t →+∞.
(i) kT A0x0 = 0. By (33), we know that 0 is the unique value such that g′(t) = 0.
We afﬁrm here that g(t) < c for all 0 < t < +∞. In fact, if there exists t0 ∈(0, +∞)
such that g(t0) ≥c, then, since g(0) = c and g(t) →0 (t →+∞), there exists
t1 ∈(0, +∞) satisfying g′(t1) = 0, which is impossible.
(ii) kT A0x0 < 0. Then, g′(0) < 0. From (33), there exists a unique t = t∗∈R
such that g′(t∗) = 0. Thus, t∗̸= 0 and g′(t) has a ﬁxed sign in interval (−∞, t∗) or
(t∗, +∞).
Ift∗< 0,then,since g′(0) < 0,wehave g′(t) < 0 fort ∈(t∗, +∞),whichimplies
that g(t) = kT exp(A0t)x0 < g(0) = c for t ∈(0, +∞).
If t∗> 0, then, since g′(0) < 0, we have g′(t) < 0 for t ∈(−∞, t∗). Therefore,
for any t ∈(0, t∗], we have g(t) < g(0) = c.
We afﬁrm here that, in this case, g(t) < c for all t∗< t < +∞. In fact, if
there exists t2 ∈(t∗, +∞) such that g(t2) > c, then, since g(t∗) < c and g(t) →0
(t →+∞), there exists t3 ∈(t∗, +∞) satisfying g′(t3) = 0, which is impossible. □
Remark 1 From the proof of Lemma 1, for any x0 ∈L, if kT A0x0 < 0, then O(x0)
intersects L transversally at x0. Here, O(x0) means the whole orbit with initial
condition x0.
Lemma 2 For system (31), suppose that the eigenvalues of A0 are given by
α ± βj
with α < 0, β > 0 and j = √−1. Let
x∗=
c
kT A−1
0 k⊥A−1
0 k⊥,

with k⊥= (−k2, k1)T .

Obviously, x∗∈L. Moreover, denote by x∗the ﬁrst intersection of the ﬂow with
initial condition x∗under negative ﬂight time with straight line L (see Fig.5b). Then,
for x0 ∈L,
O+(x0) ⊂L−if and only if x0 ∈(x∗, x∗) ∪{x∗},
where (x∗, x∗) denotes {x ∈R2|x = λx∗+ (1 −λ)x∗, 0 < λ < 1}.
Proof
(a) Proof of sufﬁciency
Simple calculations show that x∗=
c
kT A−1
0 k⊥A−1
0 k⊥is the unique point at which the
sector ﬁeld is tangent to L. Obviously the origin O is a stable focus belonging to
L−. It is easy to see that {Φ(t, x∗)|t∗< t < 0} ⊂L−, where t∗is the negative ﬂight
time from x∗to x∗(Fig.5b).
Now, consider the region D surrounded by the union set of {x∗}, {Φ(t, x∗)|t∗<
t < 0}, {x∗} and (x∗, x∗). Obviously, the interior of D belongs to L−. Moreover, for
any x0 ∈(x∗, x∗), the vector ﬁeld at x0 must be transversal to the direction of L and
point to the interior of D. If not, then there exists x1 ∈(x∗, x∗), at which the sector
ﬁeld points to L+. Then, there exists x2 ∈(x1, x∗) ⊂(x∗, x∗), at which the sector
ﬁeld is tangent to L. But this is a contradiction with the fact that x∗is the unique
point, at which the sector ﬁeld is tangent to L.
From the above discussions, it is easy to see that D is positively invariant. Thus,
O+(x0) ⊂L−for any x0 ∈(x∗, x∗) ∪{x∗}.
(b) Proof of necessity
By the detailed proof of sufﬁciency, the proof of necessity is trivial, which is omitted.
□
Remark 2 In Lemma 2, although it is impossible to give an explicit formula for x∗,
for speciﬁc systems, we can ﬁrst calculate x∗by (34) explicitly. Then, it can be seen
that x∗is equivalent to exp(A0t∗)x∗, where t∗is the largest negative solution of the
following implicit equation of t:

544
X.-S. Yang et al.
kT exp(A0t)x∗= c.
For a speciﬁc system, the approximate value of x∗can be easily calculated numeri-
cally.
Remark 3 In Lemma 2, we stress a useful fact that, for any x0 ∈(x∗, x∗), the whole
orbit with initial condition x0 intersects L at x0 transversally. Moreover, O+(x∗) is
tangent to L at x∗with O+(x∗) −{x∗} ⊂L−, which implies that
O+(x0) ⊂L−∪L if and only if x0 ∈[x∗, x∗],
where [x∗, x∗] = {x ∈R2|x = λx∗+ (1 −λ)x∗, 0 ≤λ ≤1}.
Now, consider system (1) with n = 3, c = (c1, c2, 1)⊺, as follows [12]:
˙x =
Ax + a,
cT x ≤d
Bx + b,
cT x > d , x = (x1, x2, x3)⊺∈Rn,
(35)
with the invertible matrix
A =
⎛
⎝
a11 a12 0
a21 a22 0

0 λA
⎞
⎠, B =
⎛
⎝
b11 b12 0
b21 b22 0
0
0 λB
⎞
⎠.
To investigate the existence of heteroclinic cycles in system (35), it should be
clear that we only need to study the following three possibilities for the eigenvalues
associated with A and B.
(E1) the eigenvalues of A: λA, λ1, λ2 with λA > 0, λ1,2 < 0; the eigenvalues
of B: λB, μ1, μ2 with λB > 0, μ1,2 < 0.
(E2) the eigenvalues of A: λA, α ± βj with λA > 0, α < 0, β > 0; the eigen-
values of B: λB, μ1, μ2 with λB > 0, μ1,2 < 0.
(E3) the eigenvalues of A: λA, α ± βj with λA > 0, α < 0, β > 0; the eigen-
values of B: λB, ρ ± ωj with λB > 0, ρ < 0, ω > 0.
The heteroclinic cycles corresponding to the above (E1), (E2) and (E3) can be
illustrated by Fig.6a–c, respectively.
All other possibilities for the eigenvalues of A and B follow from the above three
cases via time reversal or by exchanging the positions of A and B.
Now, we state the main results of this subsection.
Theorem 21.6 For system (35) under the eigenvalues condition (E1), suppose the
following conditions hold:
(i) cT p < d, cT q > d;
(ii) cT p0 = cT q0 = d;
(iii) cT A(q0 −p) ≤0, cT B(p0 −q) ≥0.
Then, there exists a heteroclinic cycle Γ connecting p and q, which intersects the
switching plane Σ at only two points, p0 and q0, see Fig.6a.

Singular Cycles and Chaos in Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems
545
Moreover, assume that the above condition (iii) is substituted by the following
more rigorous condition:
(iii’) cT A(q0 −p) < 0, cT B(p0 −q) > 0.
Then, Γ crosses Σ transversally at p0 and q0.
Theorem 21.7 For system (35) with the eigenvalues condition (E2), suppose the
following conditions hold:
(i) cT p < d, cT q > d;
(ii) cT p0 = cT q0 = d;
(iii) cT B(p0 −q) ≥0, q0 ∈[x∗, x∗];
where x∗=
d−cT p
cT A−1c⊥A−1c⊥+ p, with c⊥= (c2, −c1, 0)T , [x∗, x∗] = {x ∈R2|x =
λx∗+ (1 −λ)x∗, 0 ≤λ ≤1}, with x∗denoting the ﬁrst intersection of the ﬂow of sys-
tem (35), with initial condition x∗, with straight line L = {x ∈R3|cT x = d} ∩{x ∈
R3|z = z p} under negative ﬂight time. Then, there exists a heteroclinic cycle Γ con-
necting p and q together, see Fig.6b.
Moreover, assume that the above condition (iii) is substituted by the following
more rigorous condition:
(iii’) cT B(p0 −q) > 0, q0 ∈(x∗, x∗);
Then, Γ intersects the switching plane Σ at only two points, p0 and q0, transversally.
Theorem 21.8 For system (35) with the eigenvalues condition (E3), suppose the
following conditions hold:
(i) cT p < d, cT q > d;
(ii) cT p0 = cT q0 = d;
(iii) p0 ∈[ˆx∗, ˆx∗], q0 ∈[ˇx∗, ˇx∗];
where
ˆx∗=
d−cT q
cT A−1c⊥A−1c⊥+ q and ˘x∗=
d−cT p
cT A−1c⊥A−1c⊥+ p,
with c⊥= (c2, −c1, 0)T , ˆx∗denotes the ﬁrst intersection of the ﬂow of system (35),
with initial condition ˆx∗, under negative ﬂight time with straight line L = Σ ∩{x ∈
R3|z = zq}, and ˇx∗denotes the ﬁrst intersection of the ﬂow of system (35), with initial
condition ˇx∗, under negative ﬂight time with straight line L = Σ ∩{x ∈R3|z = z p}.
Then, there exists a heteroclinic cycle Γ connecting p and q, see Fig.6c.
Moreover, assume that the above condition (iii) is substituted by the following
more rigorous condition:
(iii’) p0 ∈(ˆx∗, ˆx∗), q0 ∈(ˇx∗, ˇx∗);
Then, Γ intersects the switching plane Σ at only two points, p0 and q0, transversally.

Remark 4 From the proof to be presented in the next subsection, the heteroclinic
cycle Γ in Theorems 21.1–21.3 can all be expressed explicitly by the following
formula:
Γ = {exp(At)p0|t ≤0} ∪{exp(Bt)p0|t > 0} ∪{exp(Bt)q0|t <
0} ∪{exp(At)q0|t ≥0}.
Remark 5 The above results can be easily generalized to 3-dimensional piecewise-
afﬁne systems with more saddle points, which belong to different separated zones.
In the following, we present an analytical proof for Theorem 21.7, based on
Lemmas 1 and 2. The proofs for Theorems 21.6 and 21.8 are similar. For simplicity,
we omit them here.
Proof of Theorem 21.7 From condition (i), it is easy to see that p and q are the only
two saddle points of system (35), with
p ∈Σ−and q ∈Σ+.
Note that, if considering only the subsystem
˙x = Ax + a, x ∈R3,
(36)
then p is a saddle-focus of system (36), with a 1-dimensional unstable manifold and
a 2-dimensional stable manifold described by
W u(p) = {x ∈R3|x = p + k(0, 0, 1)T , k ∈R} and W s(p) = {x ∈R3|z = z p},
respectively. Similarly, if considering only the subsystem
˙x = Bx + b, x ∈R3,
(37)
then q is a saddle point of system (37), with a 1-dimensional unstable manifold and
a 2-dimensional stable manifold described by
W u(q) = {x ∈R3|x = q + k(0, 0, 1)T , k ∈R} and W s(q) = {x ∈R3|z = zq},
respectively.
From (ii), we have that
p0 ∈W u(p) ∩Σ ∩W s(q), q0 ∈W u(q) ∩Σ ∩W s(p).
Now, we denote the ﬂows of systems (36) and (37) with initial condition x0 by
ΦA(t, x0) and ΦB(t, x0), respectively. From (9), it is obvious that, as the ﬂows of
(36) and (37),
ΦA(t, p0) →p, t →−∞; ΦB(t, p0) →q, t →+∞;
ΦB(t, q0) →q, t →−∞; ΦA(t, q0) →p, t →+∞.

548
X.-S. Yang et al.
Obviously, to accomplish the ﬁrst part of the proof of the theorem, it sufﬁces to
show that
{ΦA(t, p0)|t < 0} ⊂Σ−,
(38)
{ΦB(t, p0)|t > 0} ⊂Σ+,
(39)
{ΦB(t, q0)|t < 0} ⊂Σ+,
(40)
{ΦA(t, q0)|t > 0} ⊂Σ−∪Σ.
(41)
Since p ∈Σ−and p0 ∈W u(p) ∩Σ, we know that as the negative semi-orbit of
p0, {ΦA(t, p0)|t < 0} is a straight line connecting p and p0, which belongs to Σ−
entirely. Thus, (38) holds. Similarly, (40) holds.
Now, for system (35), let y = x −q. Then, system (35) is transformed to the
following system:
˙y =
Ay + Aq + a,
if cT y ≤d −cT q
By,
if cT y > d −cT q.
Thus,
{ΦB(t, p0)|t > 0} ⊂Σ+
if and only if
{ ˜ΦB(t, p0 −q)|t > 0} ⊂{y ∈R3|cT y > d −cT q},
where ˜ΦB(t, ·) means the ﬂow generated by the system ˙y = By (y = (y1, y2, y3)T ∈
R3). Furthermore, let B0 =
b11 b12
b21 b22

. Then, B =
B0
λB

. Elementary analysis
indicates that
{ ˜ΦB(t, p0 −q)|t > 0} ⊂{y ∈R3|cT y > d −cT q}
if and only if
{exp(B0t)(xp0 −xq, yp0 −yq)T |t > 0} ⊂{(y1, y2)T ∈R2| −c1y1 −c2y2 < cT q −d}.
(42)
From (i), we know that cT q −d > 0. In addition, by (iii) we obtain cT B(p0 −
q) ≥0, which implies that (−c1, −c2)B0(x p0 −xq, yp0 −yq)T < 0. By Lemma 1,
we know that (42) holds. Hence, (39) holds.
Analogously, in order to prove (41), let
z = x −p.
(43)

Singular Cycles and Chaos in Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems
549
Substituting (43) into (35) gives the following system:
˙z =
Az,
if cT z ≤d −cT p
Bz + Bp + b,
if cT z > d −cT p.
Obviously,
{ΦA(t, q0)|t > 0} ⊂Σ−∪Σ
if and only if
{ ˜ΦA(t, q0 −p)|t > 0} ⊂{z ∈R3|cT z ≤d −cT p},
where ˜ΦA(t, ·) denotes the ﬂow generated by the system ˙z = Az (z = (z1, z2, z3)T ∈
R3). Thus,
{ ˜ΦA(t, q0 −p)|t > 0} ⊂{z ∈R3|cT z ≤d −cT p}
if and only if
{exp(A0t)(xq0 −x p, yq0 −yp)T |t > 0} ⊂{(z1, z2)T ∈R2|c1z1 + c2z2 ≤d −cT p},
(44)
with A0 =
a11 a12
a21 a22

.
From (iii), we know that q0 ∈[x∗, x∗]. Let ˆz = (z1, z2)T , ˆc = (c1, c2)T and ˆz∗=
d−cT p
ˆcT A−1
0 ˆc⊥A−1
0 ˆc⊥. Then, q0 ∈[x∗, x∗] if and only if (xq0 −x p, yq0 −yp)T ∈[ˆz∗, ˆz∗],
where ˆz∗means the ﬁrst intersection of the ﬂow of the plane system ˙ˆz = A0ˆz, with
initial condition ˆz∗, under negative ﬂight time with plane straight line ˆL = {ˆz ∈
R2|ˆcT ˆz = d −cT p}. Note that d −cT p > 0. By Lemma 2 and Remark 3, we know
that (44) holds, which shows that (41) holds.
From the above discussions, if (i), (ii) and (iii) are all satisﬁed then there exists a
heteroclinic cycle Γ connecting p and q, which is the union set of {ΦA(t, p0)|t ≤0},
{ΦB(t, p0)|t > 0}, {ΦB(t, q0)|t < 0} and {ΦA(t, q0)|t ≥0}. Moreover, if we sub-
stitute condition (iii) for condition (iii′), then by Remarks 1 and 3, it is easy to see
that Γ intersects Σ at p0 and q0 transversally with p0 and q0 being the only two
intersections of Γ and Σ. Thus, Theorem 21.7 holds.

Šil’nikov-Type Theory for Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems
Based on the ideas of Šil’nikov-type theory for smooth systems [13–15], we can get
some similar Šil’nikov-type theory for piecewise-afﬁne systems.
Now, we list some similar Šil’nikov theorems for the 3-dimensional or 4-
dimensional piecewise-afﬁne systems with homoclinic orbits or heteroclinic cycles
discussed in the above section, without detailed proofs.

550
X.-S. Yang et al.
Theorem 21.9 Suppose that system (8) has a homoclinic orbit to p, which crosses
the switching manifold at two points, and
λA < −αA < 0.
Then, system (8) has inﬁnitely many chaotic invariant sets [7].
Theorem 21.10 Suppose that system (26) satisﬁes
αρ < 0, |α| < |ρ| and λ < 0, δρ > 0.
Then, there exist chaotic invariant sets [9].
Theorem 21.11 Suppose that system (29) has a heteroclinic cycle connecting p and
q, and intersecting the switching manifold transversally at two points, if
αAαB −λAλB < 0.
Then, system (29) has inﬁnitely many chaotic invariant sets [10].
Theorem 21.12 For system (35) with condition (E2), suppose that there exists a het-
eroclinic cycle connecting p and q, and intersecting the switching manifold transver-
sally at two points, if
αμ1 −λAλB < 1,
then system (35) has inﬁnitely many chaotic invariant sets [12].
The main ideas for proving Theorems 21.9–21.12 are to deﬁne a Poincaré map
on an appropriate cross-section located at a sufﬁciently small neighborhood of a
homoclinic orbit or heteroclinic cycle, and then study the existence of horseshoes of
the Poincaré map by the topological horseshoe theory. The methods originate from
[13–17].
For readers’ convenience, in the following we give a brief proof of Theorem 21.10,
for illustration. For more details about the proofs of Theorems 21.9–21.12, we refer
to [7, 9, 10, 12].
Proof of Theorem 21.10
Step one: Choice of a cross-section.
We known by Theorem 21.1 that, when the conditions in Theorem 21.10 are
satisﬁed, there exists a homoclinic orbit Γ that intersects Σ at two points, p =
(0, 1, 0, 0) and q = (0, 0, 0, 1). We only consider the case when α > 0, ρ < 0 in
detail; the other case, i.e., α < 0, ρ > 0, can be discussed in the same manner.

x1 = 0, ε · e

≤x2 < ε, 0 ≤x3 < ε, 0 < x4 ≤ε

Π1 = {x4 = ε},
where ε is a sufﬁciently small constant. Denote

.
Then, Π0 = ∞
k=0 Rk.
By introducing the polar coordinates to the ﬁrst two elements, i.e.,
x1 = r · cos θ, x2 = r · sin θ,
we can write Rk as
Rk = {ε · e

Step two: Construction of a Poincaré map.
Now, deﬁne the map P0 : Π0 →Π1. For a point x0 = (r0, θ0, x30, x40) ∈Π0,
P0(x0) is deﬁned as the ﬁrst intersection of ΦA(t, x0) with Π1. The time T for the
ﬂow from Π0 to Π1 is determined by x40 · eρT = ε. Then, we have
T = 1
ρ · ln ε
x40
.
Using the polar coordinates x10 = r0 cos θ0, x20 = r0 sin θ0, and note that θ0 = π/2,
the ﬁrst section map P0 : Π0 →Π1 is given by

The geometry of P0(Rk) ⊂Π1 is shown in Fig.8. Note that the arrows in Figs.7
and 8 represent corresponding direction relationships among the twelve boundaries
and their images.
Denote q∗= Γ ∩Π1. Then, q∗= (0, 0, 0, ε) by (27). For a point x0 in a small
neighborhood U(q∗) of q∗, the map P1 is deﬁned as the ﬁrst intersection of
ΦA(t, x0) (t < 0) with Σ, i.e.,

⎛

⎟⎟⎠∈Σ.
From (27), we have
x2(t) + x4(t) = eαt · (x10 · sinβt + x20 · cosβt) + ε · eρt.
Let
F(t; x10, x20) = eαt · (x10 · sinβt + x20 · cosβt) + ε · eρt −1.
Then, the ﬂight time for a point in U(q∗) to reach Σ equals the ﬁrst negative solution
of F(t; x10, x20) = 0.
In addition, we get

By the Implicit Function Theorem, there exists a neighborhood U ⊂R2 of (x10,
x20) = (0, 0) and a C1 function t(x10, x20) deﬁned on U, such that
t(0, 0) = 1

Note that, when ε is sufﬁciently small, we have P0(Rk) ⊂U(q∗), k = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
For ε sufﬁciently small, the expression of the second section map P1 : P0(Rk) →Σ
is
P1 :

ε = −2π · N0.
Moreover, deﬁne the section map from Σ to Σ as follows. Let (x1(t), x2(t),
x3(t), x4(t))T = ΦB(t, x0). Then, (28) implies
x2(t) = cos δt · x20 + sin δt · (1 −x20), x4(t) = −sin δt · x20 + cos δt · (1 −x20).
Let T < 0 be the ﬁrst return time for the ﬂow ΦB(·, x0) to reach Σ, and
F(t; x20) = x2(t) + x4(t) −1 = cos δt + (1 −2x20) · sin δt −1.
Then, T is the ﬁrst negative solution of F(t; x20) = 0.
Note that π
2δ < t < 0. We have
F
 π
2δ ; 0


 π
2δ ; 0

= −δ ̸= 0, F(t; 0) ̸= 0.
So, when x20 is sufﬁciently small, T can be expressed as a continuous function of
x20, i.e.,
T (x20) = T (0) + T ′(0) · x20 + O((x20)2) = π
2δ −2
δ · x20 + O((x20)2).
From (28), there exists a sufﬁciently small neighborhood V (q) ⊂Σ of q, such
that

Now, deﬁne a map P3 from Π0 to Σ under the ﬂow of system (26). For a point x0 =
(0, x20, x30, x40)T ∈Π0, deﬁne P3(x0) as the ﬁrst intersection point of ΦA(t, x0) (t >

ε, we have

Note that all the images of the boundaries of Rk under P3 are on Σ. So, these
images can be determined by their ﬁrst three elements. By (46) and omitting the
higher-order terms, we obtain

When ε > 0 is sufﬁciently small, by (47), we obtain
v2 < v4 < 0 < v1 < v3.
Then, we can get the geometry of P3(Rk) as shown in Fig.9.
Denote P2 ◦P1 ◦P0 ≡P∗and P∗◦P−1

≡f . Then,
f ◦P3 = P3 ◦P.
Remark 6 To study the existence of chaos in system (26), we can investigate the
existence of chaotic invariant set of the full Poincaré map P, or, equivalently, of the
map f .
Step Three: the geometric structure of the Poincaré map.
Denote by Pl
i the linear parts of the maps Pi, i = 1, 2, 3, and let
Pl = (Pl
3)−1 ◦Pl
2 ◦Pl
1 ◦P0.
Since ε is sufﬁciently small, we can omit the higher-order terms and take P = Pl.
Note that P∗(Rk) and P3(Rk) are both contained in Σ. So, the geometries of
P∗(Rk) and P3(Rk) can be determined by their ﬁrst three coordinates x1, x2, x3. In
the sequel, we will prove the results in the x1-x2-x3 space.
Denote by P∗(Rk)|x1x2 and P3(Rk)|x1x2 the projections of P∗(Rk) and P3(Rk) onto
the x1-x2 plane, respectively. Then, we have the following result.

Lemma 3 Suppose that αρ < 0, ρδ > 0, |α| < |ρ| and λ < 0 in system (26). Con-
sider Rk for a ﬁxed k, large enough. Then, the inner boundary of P∗(Rk)|x1x2 will
intersect the lower boundary of P3(Ri)|x1x2 at two points for i ≥k (Fig.10).
Lemma 4 Suppose that ρα < 0, |α| < |ρ|, λ < 0, ρδ > 0 in system (26). For
sufﬁciently large k, the Poincaré map P possesses an invariant Cantor set Σ ⊂Rk,
on which it is topologically conjugate to a full shift on two symbols (Fig.11).
From the above results, Theorem 21.10 is proved.

Thus, system (48) satisﬁes the conditions in Theorems 21.1 and 21.9. Hence, the
system has a homoclinic orbit to equilibrium point p, as shown in Fig.12a.
In addition, from α1 + λ = −19.5 < 0, system (48) satisﬁes the conditions in
Theorem 21.2. Thus, system (48) has inﬁnitely many chaotic invariant sets. A chaotic
invariant set is shown in Fig.12b.
Moreover, from computer simulations, the invariant set appears to be a chaotic
attractor.

α = 1, ρ = −1.5, λ = δ = −1, β = 1 .

Then, the conditions in Theorems 21.3 and 21.10 are satisﬁed. Hence, there exists
a chaotic invariant set. In fact, by choosing randomly a number of initial states in
a small neighborhood of the homoclinic orbit and computing their trajectories for a
long time, we see that the chaotic invariant set is chaotic attractor as shown in Fig.13.

Summary
In this chapter, we have reviewed the recent results on the existence of homoclinic
orbits and heteroclinic cycles in piecewise-afﬁne systems, and shown how to extend
the well-known Šil’nikov theory to study chaos in this class of piecewise-smooth
systems. As illustrations of the results, we have demonstrated a few examples that
have homoclinic cycles or heteroclinic cycles.
There are numerous topics to be studied within the context of piecewise-afﬁne
systems that are of general interest. Here, we just mention a few of them:
(1) After establishing the existence of homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycles,
a natural step is to prove the existence of chaotic invariant sets under some mild
conditions. For dimensions greater than three, this is a hard and tedious job. It is
expected to make some progress in the near future.
(2) It is also of signiﬁcance to investigate global bifurcations near homoclinic
orbits and heteroclinic cycles. As commented at the beginning of this chapter, detailed

Singular Cycles and Chaos in Piecewise-Afﬁne Systems
563
investigations on the dynamics of piecewise-afﬁne systems will also provide deep
insights into the dynamics of smooth dynamical systems.
(3) The existence of periodic orbits, especially limit cycles, in piecewise-afﬁne
systems is a good topic. Since periodic phenomena are ubiquitous in natural and man-
made systems, much work should be carried out on this topic. For two-dimensional
piecewise-afﬁne systems, there exist many publications on periodic orbits, as for
higher-dimensional cases, much more work remains to be done to ﬁnd methods and
theories on the existence of periodic orbits.

Introduction
Most known chaotic ﬂows such as the Lorenz [1], Rössler [2], Chen [3], Sprott
(cases B–S) [4] attractors are excited by unstable equilibria. Thus, they can be found
by putting initial conditions in the vicinity of the saddle points [5]. Recently, a
new category, which is called “hidden attractors” amuses a lot of attention [5–16].
Chaotic ﬂows of this category are not associated with any saddle point, including
the cases without any equilibrium points, with only stable equilibria, or with an
inﬁnite number of equilibrium points [17–32]. The attractors of this category are
called hidden because of the difﬁculty in ﬁnding them without any systematic way.
On the other hand, because of their unexpected and potentially disastrous responses
to perturbations in such structures like a bridge or an aircraft wing, hidden attractors
are important in engineering applications.
In this chapter, we introduce a new chaotic ﬂow with a line of equilibria that has
a different structure from those reported previously [30, 31]. In the next section, we
describe the new chaotic system. In Sect.3, we investigate the behavioral properties
of the system from the viewpoint of bifurcation analysis and Lyapunov exponents.
We propose circuit implementation of the system in Sect.4. Finally, we conclude the
study in Sect.5.

Model of Simple Chaotic Flows with a Line of Equilibria
Consider the following system with six terms:
˙x = y
˙y = 0.4xz
˙z = 0.3y −0.1z −1.4y2 + kxy.
(1)
which is a three-dimensional ﬂow with three state variables, x, y, z and one param-
eter, k. The divergence of the system (1) is
∇V = ∂˙x
∂x + ∂˙y
∂y + ∂˙z
∂z = −0.1.
(2)
Thus, this system is dissipative with ∇V < 0. In order to ﬁnd the equilibrium points
of the system, the right-hand sides of these equations are set to zeros:
y = 0
0.4xz = 0
0.3y −0.1z −1.4y2 + kxy = 0 →z = 0.
(3)
According to Eq. (3), the system of Eq. (1) has an inﬁnite number of equilibria
located on the line E∗: y = 0 & z = 0.
The Jacobian matrix of system (1) along the line of equilibria E∗is

Its characteristic equation, given by evaluating |λI −J| = 0, is
λ × (λ2 + 0.1λ −0.12x −0.4kx2) = 0.
(5)
Thus, the system has three eigenvalues:
λ = 0,
λ = −0.1±

It is clear that the sign of the real part of the two nonzero eigenvalues is dependent
on the x position of the equilibrium points on the line E∗.

has a chaotic hidden attractor, which could not be found using the line of equilib-

ria. Eq. (6) shows that the stability of these equilibrium points is related to their x
locations. In the case of k = −0.2, equilibrium points are unstable in the interval
x ∈[0, 1.5]. Fig. 1 shows the projections of the chaotic attractor with initial condi-
tions (−1.53, 0.33, 0.39). The equilibria in each projection are shown in black dots.
Under these conditions, the system has Lyapunov exponents λ1 = 0.004, λ2 = 0
and λ3 = −0.104, and its Kaplan-York dimension is DKY = 2.0385. The basin of
attraction of the chaotic hidden attractor in plane z = 0 under these conditions is
presented in Fig. 2.

Bifurcation Analysis
The behaviors of system (1) are investigated with respect to the changing parameter
k. In part (a) of Fig. 3, the bifurcation diagram of the system is shown by increasing k,
and part (b) of Fig. 3 investigates the behaviors of the system via Lyapunov exponents.
As the parameter k increases, a strange attractor emerged through a period-doubling
route. In the interval −0.8 < k < −0.4045, the system has an equilibrium point.
Then, with k = −0.4044, the system changes its behavior and creates a limit cycle.
Furthermore, when k increases, a period-doubling route to chaos happens. Fig. 4
displays the chaotic attractor of the system with k = −0.27. Lyapunov exponents of
the system are λ1 = 0.0075, λ2 = 0 and λ3 = −0.1075 under this condition, and its
Kaplan-York dimension is DKY = 2.0698. With k = −0.268, the chaotic attractor is
destroyed, and a period-three attractor emerges. Then, another period-doubling route
to chaos happens. Fig. 3 shows that the system has a little different chaotic behavior
in −0.25 < k < −0.05 rather than the previous ones and walks through two separate
regions. Comparing the attractors in Figs. 1 and 4 highlights the differences of these
two chaotic attractors.

Circuit Implementation
Physical realizations of chaotic models have been applied in various engineering
areas. In this section, an electronic circuit is introduced to realize the theoretical
system (1). By using common electronic components, the circuit is designed as
presented in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, the voltages of capacitors are denoted as X, Y, Z.
By applying Kirchhoff’s circuit laws to the circuit, its circuital equations are
obtained as follows:

Introduction
Discovering and analyzing new chaotic systems with desired properties have received
more and more interest and attention because of the potential applications of such
systems in biology [1–8], economics [9, 10], ecosystems [11, 12] and electronic cir-
cuits [13, 14], etc. Meanwhile, having preferred number(s) of equilibria has attracted
even more interest due to the special features of such dynamical systems. Some of
such systems are chaotic with no equilibrium [15–23], only one stable equilibrium
[24–27], a curve of equilibria [28–32], or a plane of equilibria [33].
In this chapter, an interesting three-dimensional chaotic system, known as the
Wang-Chen system [23], is analyzed, which has no equilibrium in some ranges of its
key parameter. This system is clearly in the class of systems with hidden attractors
[34, 35]. It is well known that some complex dynamical systems have coexisting
attractors. This property of systems is called multistability [36–38]. As the Wang-
Chen system does not have homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, the Šil’nikov criterion

is not applicable to analyze this system [39]. We thus use Lyapunov exponents (LEs),
bifurcation diagram and basin of attraction to evaluate this system. Furthermore, sta-
bility analysis of the system is performed in parameter ranges where it has equilibria,
so as to characterize its statistical properties. Furthermore, an electronic implemen-
tation of the system is presented in Sect.3. Finally, concluding remarks are given in
Sect.4.

A Chaotic System
A 3D chaotic autonomous system, the Wang-Chen system [23], is described by
˙x = y
˙y = z
˙z = −y + 3y2 −x2 −xy + a
(1)
where a is a constant parameter.
When a > 0, this system has two symmetrical equilibria: (√a, 0, 0) and (−√a,
0, 0), with the Jacobian matrix given by
J =

Considering these eigenvalues, both equilibria are spiral repellers for a > 0, at
which these equilibria exist. In these ranges, the system has chaotic and periodic
dynamics as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.
When a = 0, these two symmetrical equilibria merge into one, the origin (0, 0, 0).
When a < 0, there is no equilibrium in this system, but interestingly the system
can generate a chaotic attractor, as shown in Fig. 3.
2.1
Lyapunov Exponents
To evaluate the chaoticity of the Wang-Chen system, LEs are calculated as functions
of the key parameter a.
In Fig. 4a, LEs are shown when parameter a is changed from −0.078 to 5.0. To
ﬁnd multistability of this system, consider the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE).
Other LEs are also plotted as the parameter a is changed from 5.0 to −0.078, as
shown in Fig. 5a.

ComparingFigs.4aand5a,forsomevaluesoftheparameter(a = 0.196 −0.244),
the signs of LLE in these ﬁgures are opposite, which shows that a chaotic attractor
(sign of LLE is positive) coexists with another attractor (sign of LLE is negative)
with these parameter values. As this system does not have any equilibria within this
range, the other attractor would be a limit cycle or a torus.

presented in the following.
2.2
Bifurcation Analysis
To illustrate the qualitative changes of the system versus the key parameter a, bifur-
cation diagram of the system is presented in Fig.4b. Regarding Fig.4b, the system
has a period-doubling bifurcation route to chaos and some periodic windows exist

A. Bayani et al.
Fig. 5 a Lyaponuv exponents (LEs). b Bifurcation diagram, as functions of the parameter a. The
parameter a decreases from 5.0 to −0.078
inside the chaotic regions. Like most chaotic systems, different selections of ini-
tial conditions may result in different attractors from the system, so other bifurca-
tions may happen. It is necessary to select, when a = −0.078, the initial condition
(2.1428, −1.7663, 1.4481). The initial condition for each parameter value is the ﬁnal
value of x, y and z, corresponding to its previous parameter value, which is reached
after t = 2000s in simulations.
To examine the existence of multistability, a bifurcation diagram of the system
is shown as the parameter decreases from 5.0 to −0.078. To compare Fig.4b with
Fig.5b, these ﬁgures are plotted together in Fig.6. Multistability is seen when a =
0.196 −0.244, where a chaotic attractor coexists with a limit cycle.

0.244, where a chaotic
attractor coexists with a limit
cycle
Fig. 7 When a = 0.2180, with initial conditions (3.022,1.196,1.643) and (1.276, −0.190, 0.471),
a limit cycle and a chaotic attractor appears, respectively
2.3
Coexisting Attractors
Complex dynamical systems usually have some coexisting attractors, which are dis-
tinguished from one another by appropriate selections of initial conditions. This
property of complex dynamical systems may occur between different or even the
same kind of systems. For example, when the control parameter is ﬁxed, a limit
cycle may coexist with a strange attractor in a system, if they have their distinct
basins of attraction.
In the Wang-Chen system, as shown in Fig. 7, when a = 0.2180, for initial con-
ditions (3.022,1.196,1.643) and (1.276, −0.190, 0.471), a limit cycle and a chaotic
attractor appears, respectively.

system (1) when z = 0.47160
and a is ﬁxed to 0.2180.

blue regions represent
chaotic, unbounded and
periodic regions, respectively
2.4
Basin of Attraction
In addition to the dynamics analyzed in the above two sections, multistability of the
Wang-Chen system is now studied.
Note that the basin of attraction can lead to the recognition of all possible attractors
coexisting with each other. To identify initial condition regions, parameter a is ﬁxed
to 0.2180. The basin of attraction of each attractor is shown in Fig.8 when z =
0.47160, and in Fig.9 when z = 0. In Fig.9, one can see the equilibria of this system
on the x-y plane. As mentioned in Sect. 2, both of these equilibria are unstable.
As shown by Fig. 9, (−√a, 0, 0) is in the basin of an unbounded attractor and,
interestingly, (√a, 0, 0) is in the basins of both periodic and chaotic attractors. So,
both periodic and chaotic attractors are self-excited via this parameter. Also, the basin
of attraction of the system is considered when the system does not have any number
of equilibrium (when a = −0.05), as shown in Fig. 10. As Fig.10 shows, with this
parameter, the system has a chaotic attractor and an unbounded orbit. Because there
is no equilibrium with this parameter value, the chaotic attractor is a hidden attractor.
In general, considering the basin of attraction of the Wang-Chen system would
be the most effective way to identify distinct attractors. But, in the case that the
same type of attractors coexists with each other, it is useful to consider bifurcation
diagrams beside the basin of attraction.

Circuit Implementation of the Wang-Chen System
In this section, we present an electronic circuit, which realizes the theoretical Wang-
Chen system (1) with a = −0.05.
The circuit is designed using common electronic components and its schematic
is shown in Fig.11. The voltages of capacitors in Fig.11 are denoted as X, Y, Z,
which correspond to the state variables of the system (1).
From Fig. 11, the dynamical equations of the circuit are derived from Kirchhoff’s
laws, as
˙X =

˙Y =

The electronic components shown in Fig.11 are selected as: R1 = R2 = R3 =
R7 = R = 30 k, R4 = 1 k, R5 = R6 = 3 k, Va = 0.05 VDC, and C1 = C2 =
C3 = C = 2 nF. The designed circuit is implemented by using PSpice. Fig.12 illus-
trates the PSpice results of the designed circuit.

Conclusion
Inthis chapter, wehaveanalyzedthesimplechaoticWang-Chensystem, whichhas no
equilibrium, as a feature that gives interesting properties to unusual chaotic systems.
This system belongs to a new category of chaotic systems with hidden attractors.
As the Šil’nikov criterion is not applicable to such systems, having a positive
largest Lyapunov exponent with bifurcation diagrams offers a basic method for anal-
ysis and veriﬁcation of the existence of chaos and multistabilties.

Introduction
Chaos is an interesting nonlinear behavior of many natural and artiﬁcial systems.
Many researchers are studying chaos theory and chaotic systems, and various appli-
cationsofchaoshavebeenintroducedinsuchasbiologicalsystems,communications,
information encryption, electronic circuits, lasers, etc. [1–4]. Thus, researchers try to
ﬁnd and introduce new chaotic systems for their potential chaos-based applications
[5–10]. For example, recently chaotic systems with especial properties like having
hidden attractors [11–18], without any equilibrium points [7, 8, 10, 19–24], with
only stable equilibria [25–28], or with curves of equilibria [29–33], have attracted
lots of interest.

In this chapter, we introduce a new three-dimensional chaotic system and analyze
it. The unique feature of this system is that the nonlinear terms are only quadratic,
while there is no linear term. The chapter is organized as follows: in the next section,
the model and its stability analysis are presented. In the third section, bifurcation
analysis and Lyapunov exponent diagrams with respect to one of the parameters
are given. In the fourth section, a circuit implementation of the proposed system is
presented. Finally, the chapter is summarized in the last section.

The Model and Equilibria Analysis
The system we introduce in this chapter is described by
˙x = ax2 −2y2 −0.4,
˙y = −x2 + 0.2y2 + z2 + 2,
˙z = −1.4x2 + 1.6y2 + 5,
(1)
where a is the bifurcation parameter. In the above equations, the terms are only
quadratic with a constant term in each equation.
The equilibrium points of the system (1) are obtained by solving ˙x = 0, ˙y = 0
and ˙z = 0, namely
ax2 −2y2 −0.4 = 0,
(2)
−x2 + 0.2y2 + z2 + 2 = 0,
(3)
−1.4x2 + 1.6y2 + 5 = 0.
(4)
So, the equilibrium points are
x∗= ±

1.75 −a ,

y∗= ±

3.125a −0.35
1.75 −a
,
(6)
z∗= ±

1.375a + 2.42
1.75 −a
.
(7)
The equilibrium points are located on the vertexes of a cube in the space of (x, y, z)
for each value of a.
Now, consider system (1) with a = 1. In this case, the system becomes

As can be seen, the equilibrium points are placed at the vertexes of a cube in the

The characteristic equation of matrix A in variable λ is deﬁned by det(A −λI) =

By calculating the eigenvalues of the characteristic Eq. (10), it is found that all of
them have at least one positive real root or a complex root with positive real part.
Thus, they are all unstable.

Circuit Implementation
As has been reported in the literature, electronic realizations of theoretical chaotic
models are useful for practical engineering applications. In this section, we introduce
an electronic circuit for realizing the system (1). By using common electronic com-
ponents such as resistors, capacitors, operational ampliﬁers and multipliers, a circuit
is designed as represented in Fig. 6, in which the voltages of the three capacitors are
denoted as X, Y, Z.

straightforward to verify that the designed circuit indeed displays chaotic signals.

Globally Attracting Hidden Attractors
Julien Clinton Sprott
Abstract The many examples in the previous chapters should leave no doubt that
hidden attractors are common in nonlinear dynamical systems. Remarkably, hidden
attractors can have basins that ﬁll the entire space with every initial condition on the
attractor. Two such examples are shown here.

Introduction
The many examples in the previous chapters should leave no doubt that hidden
attractors are common in nonlinear dynamical systems. Previous authors have echoed
the claim that they are hard to ﬁnd because there is no systematic method to identify
initial conditions in their basin of attraction.
Thus it is ﬁtting to temper those claims with some examples of hidden attractors
that are globally attracting. Not only is every initial condition in their basin of
attraction, but every initial condition lies on the attractor, and thus they could hardly
be less hidden. Furthermore, such attractors have been known and studied long before
the recent hoopla about hidden attractors, and they have other remarkable properties
to be recounted here.

Conservative Nosé–Hoover System

ergodic) arose long ago from a quest among molecular dynamicists to ﬁnd a simple

dynamical system that would model the behavior of a harmonic oscillator in thermal
equilibrium with a heat bath at a constant temperature. Prior to the modern chaos
era, it had been assumed that any such model would need many variables. The ﬁrst
breakthrough came in 1984 when Shuichi Nosé found a Hamiltonian system with
four variables consistent with the necessary condition that the probability distribution
functions of position and momentum should be Gaussian [1] as expected for Gibbs’
canonical ensemble [2].
The following year, Bill Hoover showed that Nosé system could be reduced to a
three-dimensional form with the same properties, now known as the Nosé–Hoover
system [3]:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x −zy
˙z = y2 −1.
(1)
This system was independently discovered in a search for three-dimensional
chaotic ﬂows with ﬁve terms and two quadratic nonlinearities, and thus it is also
known as the Sprott A system [4, 5] and has been widely studied. It is the simplest
in a large class of systems with similar properties [6].
Absent the zy term, this system is a simple harmonic oscillator with x playing
the role of position, and y is its canonically conjugate momentum. The zy term
represents a nonlinear damping (for positive z) or anti-damping (for negative z) with
z controlled by the ˙z equation such that the damping averages to zero when the mean
square momentum ⟨y2⟩is unity. Thus z acts as a thermostat, controlling the average
energy of the chaotic oscillator, but allowing it to ﬂuctuate as desired to model an
oscillator in equilibrium with a heat bath [7].
System (1) is unusual because it has no equilibrium points, but neither does it
have an attractor because it is derived from a Hamiltonian [8] in which the fourth
variable is a slave of the other three and thus does not inﬂuence the dynamics.
Hence the system is conservative with the missing energy in the hidden variable,
and the oscillator is isothermal rather than isoenergetic. Such systems are called
nonuniformly conservative [9], and they share many of the properties of conventional
conservative systems.
The third variable allows the system to oscillate chaotically with a chaotic sea
whoseLyapunovexponentsare(0.0139,0,–0.0139)andthatstretchestoinﬁnityinall
three dimensions, but that encloses an intricate set of nested and intertwined invariant
tori on which the orbits are quasiperiodic with Lyapunov exponents of (0, 0, 0). All
orbits, both in the chaotic sea and on the tori, repeatedly cross the z = 0 plane, which
allows the dynamics to be completely characterized by examining a cross section
of the orbit in that plane. In particular, quasiperiodic orbits embedded anywhere in
the chaotic sea will appear as ‘holes’ in that cross section of the ﬂow. The system is
time-reversal invariant under the transformation (x; y; z; t) →(x; −y; −z; −t) as
expected for a conservative system.

Dissipative Nosé–Hoover System
There are many ways to add dissipation to a thermostatted oscillator without intro-
ducing equilibrium points and thus producing a hidden attractor. For example, the
constant term in the ˙z equation of system (1) can be replaced by a function f (x) that
is everywhere positive:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x −zy
˙z = y2 −f (x).
(2)
Physically, this corresponds to a harmonic oscillator in a heat bath with a one-
dimensional temperature gradient given by d f
dx .
This system with f (x) = 1 + ε tanh(x) (corresponding to a temperature that
varies from 1 −ε at x = −∞to 1 + ε at x = ∞with a maximum gradient of ε
at x = 0) was originally proposed and studied by Posch and Hoover in 1997 [10].
For ε = 0.38 it has a hidden chaotic attractor that extends to inﬁnity in all three
dimensions and encloses a region in the vicinity of the origin with conservative tori
and quasiperiodic orbits as shown in Fig.1 [11]. The chaotic attractor ﬁlls the entirety
of its basin of attraction, but with a highly nonuniform measure.
The attractor has Lyapunov exponents of (0.0019, 0, –0.0020) and a Kaplan–Yorke
dimension of 2.945. Thus it differs markedly from essentially all the other chaotic
attractors in this book for three-dimensional autonomous ﬂows whose Kaplan–Yorke
dimensions are only slightly greater than 2.0. In fact, the attractor is multifractal with
a capacity dimension of exactly 3.0, and it stretches to inﬁnity in all three dimensions
but with a rapidly decreasing measure. Furthermore, as ε is decreased, the Kaplan–
Yorke dimension further increases until it reaches a value of 3.0 for ε = 0, where the
standard Nosé–Hoover system (1) with a chaotic sea is recovered.
As a consequence, its basin of attraction ﬁlls the entire space except for a ﬁnite
region in the vicinity of the origin wherein tori with quasiperiodic orbits reside. This is
an example of a Class 1b basin of attraction [12]. Although it is not a global attractor,
a randomly chosen initial condition not too close to the origin is overwhelmingly
likely to lie in the basin, and it will lie on the attractor, although usually in a region
rarely visited by the orbit.
Remarkably, this dissipative system is time-reversal invariant, just like its con-
servative counterpart. The system has a repellor that overlaps the attractor, and that
becomes an attractor when time is reversed. The attractor-repellor pair as shown by
a portion of the orbits in Fig.2 have only an imperceptible shift in the z-direction of
⟨z⟩≈±1.2 × 10−4 with ⟨x⟩≈−0.6855 and ⟨y⟩= 0.

Buncha System
As if the previous case were not remarkable enough, there are variants of the Nosé–
Hoover system that are dissipative and ergodic with a hidden attractor that is the
entirety of the three-dimensional state space. Probably the simplest and most elegant
example is a reduced form of a general class of system proposed and studied by
Buncha Munmuangsaen and collaborators [13] and given by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x −azy
˙z = |y| −1.
(3)
Like the Nosé–Hoover case, this system has a single bifurcation parameter a that
can be put in any of the ﬁve terms, and that completely characterizes the system
through a one-dimensional bifurcation diagram as shown in Fig.3. For a = 0 the
system is a simple conservative harmonic oscillator with an amplitude that depends
only on the initial conditions.

Fig. 2 An orbit on the hidden attractor (in red) and on the corresponding repellor (in green) for
system (2) with f (x) = 1 + 0.38 tanh(x)
For a > 0, there are three distinct regions with bifurcations in the vicinity of
a = 0.9 and a = 2.1. For a less than about 0.9, the dynamic is dominated by nested
invariant tori with conservative quasiperiodic orbits but surrounded by a dissipative
region with limit cycles and/or strange attractors. In the range of a between about
0.9 and 2.1, there is a conservative region containing nested tori that are linked by
a symmetric pair of dissipative limit cycles and a long-duration chaotic transient
whose orbit eventually collapses onto one of the limit cycles with a riddled basin of
attraction. At a ≈2.0, the limit cycles merge into one large limit cycle at a ≈2.07
that gives birth to a strange attractor surrounding the tori. As a is increased further,
the tori shrink and eventually vanish at a ≈3.07, leaving only dissipative regions
with a single strange attractor that ﬁlls all of space.
TheKaplan–Yorkedimensionoftheattractorcontinuestoincreasewithincreasing
a, reaching a maximum of about 2.9924 at a = 7 before slowly decreasing, except
for narrow periodic windows in the vicinity of a = 2.28, 3.78, 4.00, and 6.00, as well
as other values that are unresolved in Fig.3. In these periodic windows, there is a
long-duration chaotic transient.
Although system (3) exhibits a variety of unusual behaviors, our interest here is in
the regime where there is a single ergodic strange attractor that ﬁlls all of space and
thus is technically “hidden” because the system has no equilibrium points. For that

In this plot, the colors indicate the value of the local largest Lyapunov exponent with
red positive and blue negative. While the attractor appears to be bounded, it has a
fuzzy edge, and after a sufﬁciently long time the orbit will come arbitrarily close to
every point in the three-dimensional state space.

Globally Attracting Hidden Attractors

value of the local largest Lyapunov exponent with red positive and blue negative
To conﬁrm that the system is ergodic with no embedded tori and quasiperiodic
orbits, it sufﬁces to examine a cross section of the ﬂow at z = 0. Figure5 shows such
a plot. Other than the nullclines at y = ±1, where the orbit is tangent to the plane,
there are no holes that would indicate a lack of ergodicity. A single orbit eventually
visits every point in the plane, and every initial condition produces the same plot.
Said differently, the attractor is globally attracting with a Class 1a basin of attraction
[12], and the attractor ﬁlls the whole of its basin.
The local largest Lyapunov exponent has a complicated structure as evidenced
by the variations in color. Furthermore, the equations are time-reversible under the
transformation (x, y, z, t) →(x, −y, −z, −t) just like the previous cases. When
time is reversed, the attractor becomes a repellor that looks identical to the attractor.
Thus there exists a symmetric strange attractor-repellor pair that is coincident, except
for a tiny offset in the z direction of ⟨z⟩= ±0.0023, and they exchange roles when
time is reversed.
The attractor and repellor are both multifractal with a capacity dimension of
exactly 3.0 but with a highly nonuniform measure that is far from the Gaussian that
characterizes the usual conservative ergodic harmonic oscillator. The probability
distribution functions for the three variables, along with the ﬁrst six even moments
of the distribution, are shown in Fig.6. None of the distributions have a sharp cutoff,

The colors indicate the value of the local largest Lyapunov exponent with red positive and blue

but rather they have long tails that extend to inﬁnity in all directions. Hence the
attractor and its basin ﬁll the whole of the state space.

Signum Thermostat Dissipative System
Finally, we consider a dissipative chaotic system that is fully ergodic with a measure
that more nearly approximates a Gaussian with a hidden global attractor and that is
presented here for the ﬁrst time. This system is a variant of the dissipative Nosé–
Hoover system (2) but with the zy term replaced by 2sgn(z)y and is called the signum
thermostat [14]. To preserve symmetry in the x probability distribution, f (x) is taken
as f (x) = exp(−εx2) to give
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = y
˙y = −x −2sgn(z)y
˙z = y2 −exp(−εx2).

Globally Attracting Hidden Attractors
603
Fig. 6 Probability distribution functions of the ergodic strange attractor for system (3) with a = 5.
The black curves show a Gaussian distribution with a variance (second moment) of 1.0
Physically, this corresponds to a harmonic oscillator in a heat bath with its highest
temperature at x = 0 and that approaches absolute zero at x = ±∞. Since f (x) > 0
for all x, there is no equilibrium point, and so any attractor for the system is hidden
by deﬁnition.
For ε = 0 (constant temperature), exp(−εx2) = 1, and the system is nonuni-
formly conservative and ergodic with a chaotic sea whose probability distribution is
given exactly by P(x, y, z) = exp(−x2/2 −y2/2 −2|z|)/2π. For ε small and pos-
itive, the system is dissipative and ergodic with a strange attractor whose probability
distribution departs only slightly from the case with ε = 0.
For example, ε = 0.1 gives the cross section plot at z = 0 shown in Fig.7. Aside
from the nullclines at y = ± exp(−x2/20), there is no indication of quasiperiodic
holes in the plot. The colors show that the local largest Lyapunov exponent has a
considerable structure as is typical of these systems.
The evidence that the system is dissipative with a chaotic attractor comes from
the Lyapunov exponents whose values are (0.03544, 0, –0.3636), the Kaplan–Yorke
dimension whose value is 2.9746, and the time-averaged dissipation of ⟨2sgn(z)⟩≈
9.2 × 10−3. The attractor is multifractal with a capacity dimension of 3.0.

Like the previous systems, this case is time-reversal invariant under the trans-
formation (x, y, z, t) →(x, −y, −z, −t) with an attractor-repellor pair that fully
overlap with only a tiny offset in the z-direction. The attractor has a global Class 1a
basin of attraction [12], and the attractor ﬁlls the entire basin.
Figure8 shows the small departure of the probability distribution functions from
the ones with ε = 0. The dissipative oscillator spends slightly less time in the vicinity
of the origin where it is heated strongly as well as far from the origin where it is
cooled, and relatively more time at intermediate values. Although the tails of the
distributions are suppressed, they still extend to inﬁnity in all directions so that every
initial condition is on the attractor.
Smaller values of ε give distributions even closer to a Gaussian and Kaplan–
Yorke dimensions that approach ever closer to the limit of 3.0. The system remains
ergodic for ε up to about 3.4 except for periodic windows with long duration chaotic
transients, whereupon the chaotic attractor is replaced by a globally attracting hidden
limit cycle. This is not surprising since the temperature is an amplitude parameter
that does not affect the dynamic in the conservative constant-temperature case with
a signum thermostat. However, the probability distributions become increasingly
peaked at intermediate values of x and y as ε increases.

Summary and Conclusions
The Nosé–Hoover system is almost certainly the simplest example of a nonuni-
formly conservative chaotic ﬂow without equilibria, but the chaotic sea coexists with
regions of quasiperiodicity. It is the simplest example of a wide class of thermostatted
oscillators, which are time-reversal invariant in accordance with Newton’s laws and
that exhibit aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics such as a Gaussian
probability distribution function. It is possible to eliminate the quasiperiodic regions
and obtain systems that are fully ergodic with the orbit visiting every point in space
as desired for a realistic physical model.
There are various ways to add dissipation to such systems and produce strange
attractors that are hidden and that ﬁll almost the entire state space, typically with
a ﬁnite region that is occupied by tori with conservative quasiperiodic orbits. Most
remarkably, it is also possible to modify the dissipative systems in such a way as to
make them fully ergodic with a multifractal strange attractor that is globally attracting
and ﬁlls the whole of space and yet satisﬁes the deﬁnition of being hidden. Two such

examples were given here. These systems may be more realistic models of physical
phenomena than are the purely mathematical models with hidden attractors that
constitute most of the other examples in this book.

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in

Introduction
The concept of symmetry dominates modern fundamental physics, both in quantum
theory and in relativity. While symmetry plays a crucial role in modern physics, its
dual concept “symmetry breaking” is also very important. Spontaneous Symmetry
Breaking (SSB), in contrast to explicit symmetry breaking, is a spontaneous process
through which a system governed by a symmetrical dynamic ends up in an asymmet-
rical state. It thus describes systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian
function obey certain symmetries, but their lowest energy solutions do not exhibit
that symmetry. So, the symmetry of the equations is not reﬂected by individual solu-
tions, but it is reﬂected by the symmetrical coexistence of asymmetrical solutions.
An actual measurement reﬂects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the
symmetry of the underlying theory. “Hidden” is perhaps a better term than “broken”
because the symmetry is always there in these equations.

SSB in Quantum Field Theory
Without spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), the local gauge principle requires
the existence of a number of bosons as force carriers. However, some particles (the
so-called W and Z bosons) would then be predicted to be massless. While in reality,
they are observed to have mass. To overcome this conﬂict, spontaneous symmetry
breaking is augmented by the Higgs mechanism to give these particles masses. It
also suggests the presence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, reported as possibly

identiﬁable with a boson detected in 2012. SSB occurs whenever a given ﬁeld in a
given Lagrangian has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. The Lagrangian appears
symmetric under a symmetry group, but after randomly selecting a vacuum state, the
system no longer behaves symmetrically.
2.1
Real Scalar Field Example
Consider the scalar Lagrangian given by
L = 1
2(∂μϕ)2



“kinetic term”

2μ2ϕ2 −λ
4!ϕ4



"potential term",
(1)
where ϕ is the scalar ﬁeld, μ is a sort of “mass” parameter, and λ is the coupling.
Observe that there is a symmetry of ϕ →−ϕ (a discrete symmetry). One can think
of the potential as being
V (ϕ) = −1
2μ2ϕ2 + λ
4!ϕ4,
(2)
which has extremes when its derivative is zero. Actually, there are two, given by
ϕ0 = ±v = ±μ

6
λ,
(3)
where the constant v is the “vacuum expectation value”.
The vacuum, that is, the lowest-energy state, is described by a randomly chosen
point of these two new extremes. One can then write
ϕ(x) = v + σ(x),
(4)
and then rewrite the Lagrangian as
L = 1
2(∂μσ)2 −1
2(2μ2)σ 2 −


where the constant terms have been dropped. It turns out that the symmetry ϕ →−ϕ
is no longer identiﬁable.
2.2
Complex Scalar Field Example
Consider a complex scalar boson ϕ and ϕ†. The Lagrangian is

(6)
Naturally, one can write this as
L = −1
2∂μϕ†∂μϕ −V (ϕ†, ϕ),
(7)
where
V (ϕ†, ϕ) = 1
2m2ϕ†ϕ .
(8)
This Lagrangian has the U(1) symmetry, which means that it is invariant under the
transform: ϕ →eiθϕ.
In graph V (ϕ†, ϕ), plotting V vs. |ϕ|, one can see a “bowl” with Vminimum at
|ϕ|2 = 0. The vacuum of any theory ends up being at the lowest potential point, and
therefore the vacuum of this theory is at ϕ = 0, as one would expect.
Now, change the potential and consider
V (ϕ†, ϕ) = 1
2λm2(ϕ†ϕ −2)2,
(9)
where λ and  are real constants. Notice that the Lagrangian will still have the global
U(1) symmetry as before. But, by graphing V vs. |ϕ|, one gets Fig. 2.

Physics 7, 2C3 (2011)
In Fig. 2, now, the vacuum Vminimum is represented by the circle at |ϕ| = . In
other words, there are an inﬁnite number of vacuums in this theory. And, because the
circle drawn in this ﬁgure represents a rotation through a ﬁeld space, this degenerate
vacuum is parameterized by eiα, the global U(1). There will be a vacuum for every
value of α, located at |ϕ| = .
In order to make sense of this theory, one must choose a vacuum by hand. Because
the theory is completely invariant under the choice of the U(1), eiα, one can choose
any α and deﬁne that as the true vacuum. So, here, choose α to make the vacuum at
ϕ = .
Next, it is needed to rewrite this theory in terms of the new vacuum. One can
therefore expand around the constant vacuum value  to have a new ﬁeld, as
ϕ ≡ + α + iβ ,
(10)
where α and β are new real scalar ﬁelds (so, ϕ† =  + α −iβ). One can now write
out the Lagrangian as

completely symmetrical. All directions are exactly equal. But this symmetry is lost when the pencil
falls over. Now one direction holds. The symmetry that existed before is hidden the fallen pencil;

This is now a theory of a massive real scalar ﬁeld α (with mass =

a massless real scalar ﬁeld β, and ﬁve different types of interactions (one allowing
three α’s to interact, the second allowing one α and two β’s, the third allowing four
α’s, the fourth allowing two α’s and two β’s, and the last allowing four β’s to do
so.) In other words, there are ﬁve different types of vertices allowed in the Feynman
diagrams for this theory. Thus, the U(1) symmetry is no longer manifest.

Other Simple Illustrations
3.1
Pencil
It is an amazing idea that the symmetry of the equations could not be reﬂected by indi-
vidual solutions, but it is reﬂected by the symmetrically coexistence of asymmetrical
solutions.
First, consider a pencil, standing upright at the center, which is possible but unsta-
ble. The pencil tends to fall into one stable state randomly. After it falls down, the
original symmetry was broken (see Fig. 3). This is exactly the illustration of the
“Mexican hat” potential of a complex ﬁeld, shown in Fig. 2.
3.2
Stick
Consider another daily-life example: A linear vertical stick with a compression force
applied at the top and directed along its axis. The physical description is obviously
invariant for all rotations around this axis. As long as the applied force is mild enough,
the stick does not bend, and the equilibrium conﬁguration (the lowest energy con-

612

hallym.ac.kr/~physics/
course/a2u/ep/ssb.htm
ﬁguration) is invariant under this symmetry. When the force reaches a critical value,
the symmetric equilibrium conﬁguration becomes unstable, and an inﬁnite number
of equivalent lowest energy stable states appear, which are no longer rotationally
symmetric. The actual breaking of the symmetry may then easily occur due to the
effect of a (however small) external asymmetric cause, and the stick bends until it
reaches one of the inﬁnite possible stable asymmetric equilibrium conﬁgurations
(see Fig. 4).
3.3
Shortest Connecting Path
The above two examples are essentially the same, where all the new lowest energy
solutions are asymmetric but are all related through the action of the symmetry
transformation U(1).
Here is yet another elegant example.
Consider the scenario of connecting four nodes located symmetrically at four
vertices of a square. A simple solution one can draw by hand at once is like the one
shown in Fig. 5.
This solution fully maintains the original symmetry of a foursquare, and, in fact,
it is a very satisfactory solution with a total length of 2
√
2 .= 2.828.
However, the best solution turns out to be the one shown in Fig.6. The total length
is 1 +
√
3 .= 2.732, and the symmetry of the solution is less than that of the original
system.

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Nonlinear Dynamic Systems
613
Fig. 5 Connecting four nodes located symmetrically at four vertices of a square
Fig. 6 Spontaneous symmetry breaking
So, the symmetry of the original problem is reﬂected by the symmetrical coexis-
tence of asymmetrical solutions, each of which has less (or even no) symmetry than
the original full symmetry.

SSB in Nonlinear Dynamic Systems
Perhaps, the best illustrations could be given by attractor(s) of nonlinear dynamic sys-
tems. Here, consider only three-dimensional autonomous systems with two quadratic
terms, in a form similar to the Lorenz system.
4.1
Symmetrical System with Symmetrical Attractor
The symmetry of the algebraic equations determines the symmetry of its geometric
dynamics. In fact, symmetry plays an important role in generating chaos, which
somehow determines the possible shape of the resulting attractor.
For example, both the Lorenz system and the Chen system have the z-axis rota-
tional symmetry, and they both generate a two-scroll butterﬂy-shaped symmetrical
attractor.
The Lorenz system [1] is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = σ (y −x)
˙y = rx −y −xz
˙z = −bz + xy ,
(11)
which is chaotic when σ = 10, r = 28, b = 8
3.
The Chen system[2] is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = (c −a)x −xz + cy
˙z = −bz + xy ,
(12)
which is chaotic when a = 35, b = 3, c = 28.
Both Lorenz and Chen systems have z-axis rotational symmetry, in the sense that
the system algebraic equations remain the same when (x, y, z) is transformed to
(−x, −y, z).
There are totally six possible quadratic nonlinear terms: xy, yz, xz, x2, y2 and z2 in
a 3D quadratic equation. Restricted by the z-axis rotational symmetry, the nonlinear
terms in the second equation of the above 3D system must be either xz or yz, while
in the third equation they must be either xy or z2, or x2, or y2.
Based on the above observations, to maintain the z-axis rotational symmetry, the
most general form of a 3D autonomous system with only linear and quadratic terms
seems to be the following:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a11x + a12y
˙y = a21x + a22y + m1xz + m2yz
˙z = a33z + m3xy + m4x2 + m5y2 + m6z2 + c ,

Explicit Symmetry Breaking
The explicit symmetry breaking can be easily realized by adding terms that break
the symmetry of the algebraic equations. For example, adding a constant term m into

k = 0.8, (iv) k = 0.81. The two trajectories are from two different initial conditions, for the latter
case the two attractors merge into one and become symmetric
the second equation breaks the z-axis rotational symmetry:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = (c −a)x −xz + cy + m
˙z = −bz + xy .
(14)
The resulting attractor is not symmetrical anymore due to the asymmetrical dynamic
equation.
4.3
SSB of Nonlinear Systems
Constrained by the algebraical symmetry of the system equations, the above systems
generate symmetrical two-scroll attractors. But this is not always the case, because
this statement is based on the postulation that the dynamic system has only one
attractor.

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Nonlinear Dynamic Systems
617
A very interesting phenomenon is that nonlinear systems may have multiple coex-
isting attractors. One such examples is described by Ref.[3]
5
Discussion
Constrained by the algebraically symmetry of the dynamic equations, the geometric
attractors generated by such a system may or may not preserve the original symmetry.
It is still puzzling to me what type of systems may break the symmetry while the
others preserve it, or what type of systems may have multiple attractors.
What’s more, in reality, one may not know the governing equation or may not fully
understand its symmetry. What we can directly observe is the physical phenomenon,
where the trajectory and the attractor may be asymmetric, thus we may overlook the
underlying symmetry. If the observation (attractors) cannot reﬂect the underlying
symmetry of the fundamental physic law, then the symmetry is considered “hidden”.
Thus, SSB allows the symmetry theory to describe asymmetric reality. SSB pro-
vides a way of understanding the complexity of nature without renouncing the funda-
mental symmetries. So, we believe or prefer symmetric to asymmetric fundamental
laws.
In one word, symmetry is simple and elegant, while symmetry breaking makes
the world complex and colorful.

Starting with Symmetry
1.1
Unity and Symmetry of Physical Laws
There are various kinds of symmetry in nature. A symmetry in the real world may be
approximately satisﬁed. There are so many different kinds of symmetry in nature that
involve different objects and different types to different degrees. What’s the nature of
symmetry?Inessence,symmetryistoremaininvariantundercertaintransformations.
Symmetry in mathematics is often more abstract and essential, and the basic
tool for describing symmetry in mathematics is group theory. Around 1831, the
young French mathematician Galois, on the basis of his predecessors’ research,
discovered the symmetry of the roots of algebraic equations from the well-known
Weida’s theorem and conceived the concept of “groups”. He also creatively solved
the solvability problem of algebraic equations from the viewpoint of symmetry. He
systematically explained that there are no formulas for solutions of a quintic equation
or equations with degrees higher than ﬁve, but there are formulas for solutions of
equations with degrees four or lower. He solved two of the three great drawing
problems since ancient times: “One cannot divide an angle into three equal parts at
will” and “it is impossible to double a cube”. These problems, which do not seem to
be directly related to symmetry, are perfectly solved by Galois from the viewpoint of
deep symmetry. Therefore, the study of symmetry is a shortcut to grasp the essence
of a problem. Inspired by Galois’s work, Lie established his theory by linking groups
to differential equations. The theory of Lie group in Lie algebra provides a powerful

tool for geometric interpretations of modern physics, and the Lie group indeed plays
a very important role in particle physics.
The importance of symmetry in modern physics cannot be overemphasized. Sym-
metry is central to general relativity and quantum mechanics, which are the twin
pillars of modern theoretical physics. “The themes of the 20th-century physics are
quantization, symmetry and phase factors,” Mr. Chen-Ning Yang once said. In fact,
the symmetry that physics is concerned with is the symmetry of physical laws, which
is a very deep kind of symmetry. That is to say, the physical laws should be kept
invariant under certain transformations, which is essentially the inherent require-
ment of the unity of the physical laws. The direction of the development of physics
is to seek a deeper understanding of nature, a more uniﬁed understanding, a greater
symmetry in some sense.
It is fair to say that every major advance in modern physics, from special relativity,
general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum ﬁeld theory, to gauge theory, has
been shaped by the idea of transformation invariance. Dirac also pointed out that
the future direction of theoretical physics is to continue to expand the invariance of
transformations.
1.2
Action and Symmetry
The laws of physics, as they are called, can often be expressed in terms of the least-
action principle, and the study of the symmetry of the laws becomes the study of the
symmetry of the action itself.
The ﬁeld theory model of a particle system based on the action principle is the
basic procedure of constructing a dynamical model in quantum ﬁeld theory, which
is an important way to establish theory in modern physics. For an inﬁnite degree-
of-freedom system in ﬁeld theory, the regular coordinates of the system are ﬁeld
variables, where the space coordinate Phi(V ECx, t) is used to identify the different
degrees of freedom of the system. The action of the system is
S =

whered4x = dtd3x isafour-dimensionalvolumeelementofLorentzinvariantspace-
time; L is the Lagrangian of the system, which is a functional of the ﬁeld quantity
and its derivative, and does not depend directly on the space-time coordinates.
Based on the experience of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetic the-
ory, it is generally expected that the equation of motion is only a second-order partial
differential equation of space-time coordinates, so it is assumed that it depends only
on ϕ and ∂μϕ. The Lagrangian can contain higher-order differential terms (even
fractional-order terms), but the higher-order differential terms are usually not con-
sidered based on the experience of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetic
theory.

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
621
The principle of ﬁeld action requires that, when the ﬁeld quantity have a small
variation under certain conditions:
δS = 0
(2)
we can derive the Euler–Lagrange equation. It is the equation of motion of the ﬁeld
ϕ:
∂L
∂ϕ −∂μ
∂L
∂

∂μϕ
 = 0
(3)
The ﬁeld theory model of relativity usually initiates from the Lagrangian of the
ﬁeld. A model of the ﬁeld theory is a concrete assumption about the Lagrangian of
the ﬁeld. Knowing the Lagrangian of the ﬁeld, we can get the motion equations of
the ﬁeld from its Euler–Lagrange equation. In quantum ﬁeld theory, if we know the
Lagrangian, we know the corresponding Feynman rule, and thus everything about
the theory in principle.
1.3
Noether Theorem, Conserved Flows and Conserved
Quantity
Noether theorem states that each symmetry of an action corresponds to a conservation
law, and therefore a conservation current and a conservation quantity can be deﬁned
accordingly. The two main concepts of symmetry and conservation are closely linked.
The Noether theorem, which links symmetry and conservation laws in classical
physics, has since been extended to quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics and
particle physics, some new internal degrees-of-freedom have been introduced, and
some new symmetries of the abstract space and the corresponding conservation laws
have been realized. Especially now, the group theory is more advantageous to deal
with the problems according to the symmetry of a quantum system.
In classical mechanics, the familiar correspondence is that the time translational
symmetry (time translation invariance) corresponds to the conservation of energy,
and the rotational symmetry (space isotropy) corresponds to the conservation of
angular momentum. Time translational symmetry and conservation of energy—time
translational symmetry requires that the laws of physics are the same in yesterday,
today and tomorrow. If the physical laws change with time, for example, the laws
of gravity change with time, it would also be possible to use the variability of grav-
ity overtime to lift water into a reservoir when gravity is so weak that requires less
work. Releasing water from a reservoir when gravity gets stronger, using hydroelec-
tric power to generate more energy, is a ﬁrst-class perpetual motion machine that
literally creates energy, which goes against the energy conservation. This clearly
shows the connection between the translational symmetry of time and the conserva-
tion of energy.

622
X. Wang
Noether proved an important theorem in 1918: if the action S of a ﬁeld is invariant
under a continuous transformation, then there exists a corresponding conservative
current jμ(x), which satisﬁes the continuity equation
∂μ jμ(x) = 0
(4)
In general, the invariance of L under some transformation is said to have some
symmetry; therefore, some symmetry of the Lagrangian corresponds to a conserva-
tion law. This is a general conclusion and is not limited to symmetries associated
with continuous transformations.
Integrating the continuous equation that the conservative current jμ(x) is satisﬁed
over the total space, we obtain

d3x ∂
∂t j0(x) +

d3x∇· j(x) = 0
(5)
Now, replace the second term with the surface integral at inﬁnity by the Gauss
theorem. When j(x) is zero at inﬁnity, we have
dQ
dt = −q

∞
dσ · j(x) = 0
(6)
That is,
Q = q

d3x j0(x)
(7)
where q is the constant properly introduced in the deﬁnition of Q; therefore, the
existence of a conserved current jμ(x) means the existence of a conserved quantity
q in the whole space whose density is proportional to j0(x).
1.4
Why Is Symmetry so Important in Physics?
Why is symmetry so important in physics? In a way, this is consistent with the
fundamental goals of physics, and with our quest to understand nature, so the quest
for symmetry is rooted in the genes of theoretical physics.
• Symmetry is a prerequisite for the rational deﬁnition of fundamental physical
quantities. Based on the above discussion, we can deﬁne energy because of the
invariance of time translation. Without these symmetries, there would be no rea-
sonable way to deﬁne these fundamental quantities, and there would be no laws
governing the physics of these quantities.
• Symmetry is a prerequisite for the universality of physical laws. What we seek
is a universal law of physics, and if the laws of physics here and now cannot be
applied to here and then, this will also lose its meaning. So, the nature of theoretical

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World

physics requires that the law be as symmetric as possible, that is, as universal as
possible. So, symmetry is rooted in the genes of theoretical physics.
1.5
Symmetry is Rooted in the Genes of Theoretical Physics
In some sense, if there is no symmetry, there is no reasonable deﬁnition of these basic
physical quantities, so the physical laws of these quantities cannot be mentioned.
What we seek is a universal law of physics, and so if the laws of physics of here
and now cannot be applied to there and then, it will lose its theoretical signiﬁcance.
Therefore, the essence of theoretical physics requires the law to be as symmetrical
as possible, that is, as universal as possible. So, symmetry is rooted in the genes of
theoretical physics.
1.6
Symmetry from Outer Space-Time to Internal Space
In the past, we had learned about invariance under space-time continuous transfor-
mations, including translation invariance and Lorentz covariance. Translation invari-
ance, which reﬂects the homogeneity of space and time, is the basis of the laws of
energy and momentum conservation. Lorentz covariance is the invariance of rota-
tion of a four-dimensional space-time, reﬂecting the isotropy of the four-dimensional
space-time. It includes the invariance of 3D rotation, which is the basis of the con-
servation of angular momentum. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the ﬁeld is symmetric in
the internal space. The internal space of a ﬁeld is an abstract space introduced to
describe the internal properties of a particle ﬁeld, such as electric charge, baryon
number, lepton number, isospin, ﬂavor and color.
Moderngaugetheoryis anextensionof thespace-timesymmetrytoamoregeneral
local internal symmetry. This ﬁrst step was taken by Chen-Ning Yang and Mills, who
wanted to ﬁnd the consequences of postulating the law of isospin conservation. The
concept of isospin is introduced by N. Kemmerz in 1938, the isospin is assumed to
be similar to the electron spin when interacting. It played an important role in the
following nuclear and gauge theory. Isospin conservation is a restatement of the fact
that nuclear forces are charge independent. According to Werner Heisenberg, protons
and neutrons are two states of the same particle in an abstract isospin space. Since
charge conservation is related to phase invariance, by analogy one would guess
that strong interaction is invariant under isospin. From the philosophy of science,
what is embodied in the gauge theory’s thinking is that objective physical events
are independent of the framework we have chosen to describe. Namely, the laws
of physics have some profound inherent invariance. Isospin invariance belongs to
the gauge theory category (isospin space is a type of internal space). The results of
Young and Mills are signiﬁcant.

In gauge theory, the internal space is “rotated” in terms of gauge group G. The
writing of elements in the norm group is
u(θ) = exp

−iθαT α
(8)
where T α is the generator of a group G, which satisﬁes the communitive relation

T α, T β
= i f αβγ T γ
(9)
where f αβγ is the structure of a group G constant; αβγ = 1, 2, . . . , N, with N being
the dimension of the group G, which is equal to the number of generators; θα is a
parameter of a group G, called a group parameter, having also N numbers. The
generators of a group can be used as operators to describe the properties of ﬁeld
particles. But what is unsatisfactory is that, unlike the structure of space-time, the
structure and symmetry of internal space are uncertain: which gauge group should
be chosen is determined by the speciﬁc properties of the ﬁeld particles and the law
of interaction between the particles.
The symmetry of a physical system in internal space is described by the invariance
of its Lagrangian under the following transformation:
Gauge transformation of the ﬁeld quantity:
Φ′(x) = exp

−iθαT α
Φ(x)
(10)
Gauge transformation of space-time derivative ∂μΦ(x) of the ﬁeld quantity:
∂μΦ(x) →∂μΦ′(x) = exp

−iθαT α
∂μΦ(x)
(11)

L

Φ′(x), ∂μΦ′(x)

= L

Φ(x), ∂μΦ(x)

(12)
The above transformation is the global gauge transformation. Because θα is a
constant independent of the space-time coordinate x, the space-time derivative of
the ﬁeld ∂μΦ(x) is just like the ﬁeld Φ(x), which is an important characteristic of
the global gauge transformation.
1.7
From Global Symmetry to Local Symmetry
The ﬁeld quantity Φσ(x) is transformed in the internal space rotation Φσ(x) →
Φ′
σ(x) = exp

−iθαT α
σρ

Φρ(x). This transformation is called the gauge transfor-
mation. When the group parameter θα is a constant independent of the space-time
coordinate x, it is called the global gauge transformation. When the group parameter
θα is a function of the space-time coordinate x: θα(x), it is called the local gauge

625
transformation. Global here means that the ﬁeld quantities of each point of space-
time do the same transformation, while local means that each point of space-time
makes its own transformation.
Under the local gauge transformation, the ﬁeld quantity transform is
Φ(x) →Φ′(x) = exp

−iθα(x)T α
Φ(x)
(13)
The transformation of the derivative of the ﬁeld quantity ∂μΦ(x) is
∂μΦ(x) →∂μΦ′(x) = exp

−iθα(x)T α
∂μΦ(x) −i∂μθβ(x)T β exp

−iθα(x)T α
Φ(x)
̸= exp

−iθαT α
∂μΦ(x)
(14)
It is different from the transformation law of the ﬁeld quantity Φ(x). This is
different from the global transformation. It can be seen that the ﬁeld of each point
of space-time is transformed according to their respective quantities in the local
gauge transformation, so when the invariant Lagrangian under the global gauge
transformation is extended to the local gauge transformation, the Lagrangian is no
longer kept unchanged.
We hope that the Lagrangian is not only invariant under the global transformation,
but also invariant under the local transformation. Since θα has nothing to do with x,
but it with x is a special case, the global gauge theory is only a special case of the
gauge theory, and the invariant Lagrangian under the global gauge transformation
should be extended to the invariant local gauge. As mentioned earlier, the Lagrangian
of global gauge invariance is not invariant under local gauge transformation because
the ﬁeld derivative ∂μΦ(x) and ﬁeld Φ(x) are transformed in the same way under
global gauge transformation, but under the local gauge transformation, it follows
different rules. So, if we replace the derivative ∂with the covariant derivative Dμ
and the ﬁeld quantity derivative ∂μΦ(x) with the ﬁeld quantity covariant derivative
∂μΦ(x), and require the ﬁeld quantity covariant derivative ∂μΦ(x) and the ﬁeld
quantity Φ(x) to be transformed in the same way, namely,
Φ(x) →Φ′(x) = exp [−iθα(x)T α] Φ(x)
DμΦ(x) →D′
μΦ′(x) = exp [−iθα(x)T α] DμΦ(x)

Introduction of Gauge Field
Next is the selection of the covariant derivative Dμ, inspired by quantum electro-
dynamics, according to Yang–Mills. We introduce the gauge ﬁeld potential Aα
μ and
deﬁne the covariant derivative as
Dμ(x) ≡∂μ + Aμ(x), Aμ(x) ≡−igAα
μ(x)T α
(17)
The gauge ﬁelds thus introduced are closely related to the gauge groups. For
each generator T α, there is a canonical potential Aα
μ(x). For α = 1, 2, . . . , N gen-
erators, there are n normal potentials. In addition, the gauge ﬁeld is introduced by
changing the derivative into covariant derivative Dμ, where ∂μ and Dμ are vectors
of four-dimensional space-time, and Aα
μ should also be vectors of four-dimensional
space-time. This means that the quantum number of spins of the gauge particle corre-
sponding to the gauge ﬁeld must be 1. The quantum numbers of the spins of photons,
gauge Boson, gluons, etc., are all 1, where g is the interaction constant.
By introducing the gauge ﬁeld Aα
μ(x) and deﬁning the covariant derivative Dμ,
the objective here is to make the covariant derivative ∂μΦ(x) have the same transfor-
mation law as the ﬁeld Φ(x) under the local gauge transformation. Thus, the invari-
ant Lagrangian under the global gauge transformation is extended to the invariant
Lagrangian under the local gauge transformation. This requires the transformation
law of the gauge potential Aα
μ(x) under the gauge transformation be determined; that
is,

∂μ −igA′α
μ (x)T α
u(θ)Φ(x) = u(θ)

∂μ −igAα
μ(x)T α

So,
A′α
μ (x)T α = u(θ)Aα
μ(x)T αu−1(θ) + i
g u(θ)∂μu−1(θ)
(19)
This is the law of transformation of the gauge potential.

Symmetry Governs Interaction: Take Electromagnetic
Force for Example
Which is more essential, the equation of motion of the interaction or the symmetry?
In classical mechanics, the conservation law of mechanical quantities can be
derived from Newton’s equation under certain conditions. At ﬁrst glance, the con-
servation law seems to be the result of the equation of motion. But, in essence, the
law of conservation is more fundamental than the equation of motion, because it
reveals some universal laws of nature, governs all processes of nature, and restricts
the equations of motion in different ﬁelds.

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
627
Symmetry governs the form of action, yet physicists cannot know a priori all the
symmetries involved in the world, and the symmetries that are already known are
not sufﬁcient for fully determining the form of action. Although the possible forms
of action have been greatly restricted, they can still take many, many possible forms,
and physicists have to take tentative methods, where the candidates for each action
were examined in turn according to the physical possibilities.
Fundamental physical equations have certain symmetry requirements, such as
Lorentz invariance, general covariance, gauge invariance, etc., which strongly con-
strain the equations and even completely determine the interactions. This is what we
call the symmetric dominating interaction.
Let’s take the electromagnetic force as an example to show how we can get the
exact mechanical equation of the interaction from the symmetry principle, why there
should be an electromagnetic ﬁeld because of the symmetry principle requirement,
and why electromagnetic ﬁelds interact in this way but not in that way because of
the need for symmetry. This is a very good example of the power of the principle
over mechanics.
The problem of mechanical systems, which boil down to the concrete form of
Lagrangian, is now illustrated by the example of a single free electron, as how to
construct Lagrangian. Then, equations of motion will be derived.
Take a system with only one free electron for example, and we ﬁrst construct the
free electron Lagrangian L . The free electron has a mass of m, a momentum of pμ,
and a wave function of ψ(x). The quantities that can be used under Lorentz invariant
requirements are ¯ψ(x), ψ(x), γμ, m, pμ. The relativistic invariants composed by
them are
L (x) = −¯ψ(x)

γμ∂μ + m

ψ(x)
(20)
where γμ is a 4 × 4 constant matrix, and pμ = −iℏ∂μ. Suppose that this is the
Lagrangian of the free electron, and by the Euler–Lagrange equation
∂L
∂ϕa
−∂μ
∂L
∂∂μϕa
= 0
(21)
we get

γμ∂μ + m

ψ(x) = 0
(22)
This is the Dirac free electron relativistic equation of motion. This equation is
invariant under the following transformation:
ψ(x) →ψ′(x) = eiαψ(x)
(23)
where α is a constant. This transformation is called the ﬁrst kind of gauge transforma-
tion, which Weyl proposed in 1929, and also called the global gauge transformation.
This α is the same constant for all space-time. Under this gauge transformation,
L ′ = L . Due to this invariance, it can be derived from Noether’s theorem, as

628
X. Wang
∂μ jμ = 0; jμ = −iα ¯ψγμψ
(24)
where Q = −i

jμ(x)d3x. Take α = e. Then, Q is the charge, jμ(x), μ = 1, 2, 3, is
the current intensity, ∂μ jμ = 0 is the charge-current conservation; that is, the global
gauge transformation invariant leads to the charge conservation.
Now, localize the transform ψ′(x) = eiαψ(x); that is, α is not a constant but varies
by x, namely, α →α(x), local gauge transformation ψ′(x) = eiα(x)ψ(x).
It can be veriﬁed that L (x) is not invariant to the local gauge transformation,
under the local gauge transformation
L ′(x) = ¯ψ′(x)[γμ(∂μ −i∂μα(x)) + m]ψ′(x)
(25)
If the Lagrange density is required to be constant under local gauge transforma-
tions, an additional term must be added to L (x) to offset the contribution of α(x),
namely,
L = −¯ψ(x)[γμ(∂μ −ieAμ(x)) + m]ψ(x)
(26)
This makes the Lagrangian invariant under the following transformation—the
local gauge transformation:
ψ(x) →ψ′(x) = eiαψ(x)
(27)
Aμ(x) →A′
μ(x) = Aμ(x) + 1
e ∂μα(x)
(28)
It makes L ′(x) = L (x).
So, the local gauge invariance requires the existence of an Aμ(x), which is the
electromagnetic potential vector, also known as the gauge potential in the gauge ﬁeld.
The gauge theory gives the interaction of electrons and electromagnetic ﬁelds as
follows:
−ie( ¯ψ(x)γμψ(x))Aμ(x) = jμAμ(x)
(29)
jμ = −ie ¯ψ(x)γμψ(x)
(30)
This is the interaction between the electron current (current) and the gauge potential
(electromagnetic potential).
Suppose that the electromagnetic tensor Fμν = ∂μAν −∂ν Aμ. The Lagrangian
density of a pure electromagnetic ﬁeld is
LA = −1
4 Fμν Fμν
(31)
The total Lagrange density of the (electron + electromagnetic ﬁeld) system is

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
629
L = −1
4 Fμν Fμν −¯ψγμ(∂μ + m)ψ + ie ¯ψγμψ Aμ
(32)
which = interaction of electromagnetic ﬁeld + free electron + current with electro-
magnetic ﬁeld.
Here,L isinvariantunderlocalgaugetransformation,whichcompletelydescribes
the electronic, electromagnetic ﬁeld system. The local gauge transformation ψ′(x) =
eiα(x)ψ(x) is regarded as the element of the U(1) group.
As can be seen from the above example, the relativistic symmetry principle is the
starting point for constructing the Lagrange density, and the principle of least action
is the starting point for deriving the dynamic equations of the system. The principle
of local symmetry is the starting point of constructing perfect electronic electromag-
netic force, which leads to the automatic and natural emergence of gauge ﬁelds, and
becomes the medium of electronic interaction, the messenger of information.

Symmetry Governs Interaction: Take General Relativity
for Example
In general, the establishment of a physical theory starts from observing data, con-
structing mathematical models, and then sublimating to universal mechanics. This
was certainly true for Newton’s theory of gravity. Firstly, Tycho Brahe and others
recorded detailed observations; then Kepler and others built a phenomenological
model of the movement of celestial bodies, and then Galileo and others built a model
of the motion of a projectile on the earth; ﬁnally, by Newton’s grand uniﬁcation, the
celestial and terrestrial models are uniﬁed into the mechanical equation of gravitation.
General relativity follows a different path. Unlike all other theories of physics,
general relativity’s theoretical development followed a path from the principle of
symmetry to equations to experiments, with startling mathematical beauty and con-
viction. It’s far simpler than any other possible scenario and has been miraculously
conﬁrmed by countless facts.
The top-down, high-rise theory of general relativity was far ahead of the experi-
mental conditions at that time of Einstein’s creation of the theory. Various predictions
made by general relativity, including gravitational waves and the effects of gravity
on the expansion of space-time, followed by the accumulated observations and data
decades and hundreds of years after the discovery of general relativity. Theories like
general relativity are almost impossible to go from data accumulation to phenomeno-
logical models to theories.
Newtonian mechanics has the symmetry of Galileo groups, special relativity has
the symmetry of Poincaré groups, and general relativity has the symmetry of general-
ized coordinate transformation invariant groups. Electromagnetic theory and general
relativity are two of the best examples demonstrating the power of the symmetry prin-
ciple.

General relativity can be regarded as a gauge theory whose gauge transformation
includes a generalized coordinate transformation. Therefore, the action of gravity
theory should be invariants under generalized coordinate transformation. We can
write the terms that satisfy the condition in the order of increasing the dimension of
energy. There is only one term of dimension 0, the cosmological term SΛ,
SΛ = −M2

In general relativity, on the other hand, the interaction between the matter ﬁeld
and the gravitational ﬁeld obeys the principle of minimum coupling. For the Bose
ﬁeld, this is equivalent to replacing all the Minkowski metric ημν in the physical ﬁeld
action Smatter with the general metric gμv(x). The space-time integral measure d4x
is replaced by the invariant form of generalized coordinate transformation d4x√−g,
and all partial derivatives ∂μ are replaced by covariant derivative ∇μ, which is deﬁned
by afﬁne connection Γ λ

The fact that the ﬁeld of matter is coupled to the gravitational ﬁeld by its kinetic
tensor leads to the equivalence principle. In a word, under the low energy and low
speed Newton limit, the 00 component of the metric ﬁeld degenerates into the Newton
gravitational potential, while the 00 component of the energy tensor is the energy
density of the matter ﬁeld and degenerates into the inertial mass density under the
Newton limit. It follows that the strength of the gravitational force felt by the place of
matter is proportional to its inertial mass, which is the original form of the equivalence
principle.
Finally, the ﬁeld equation in general relativity can be obtained by varying the
action SGR ≡SΛ + SBH + Smatter to the metric gμv, which is δSGR/δgμν = 0. The
result is
Rμν −1

Greater Symmetry? Greater Uniﬁcation?
Weyl gauge theory reveals a very important physical idea—“the conservation of
charge, or the symmetry of a local U(1) group, determines all electromagnetic inter-
actions”. He pointed out that “as long as the system has a symmetry of U(1), there
must be electromagnetic interactions between the particles in the system” and “all
gauge interactions must be transferred by gauge quanta”. Weyl’s ideas had a “great
appeal” to Chen-Ning Yang, prompting him to come up with a bold and tantaliz-
ing idea: to extend the gauge theory that Weyl discovered and proposed from the
conservation of charge to the conservation of isospin.
Putting forward by Chen-Ning Yang (1922-) and Robert Mills (1927–1999) in
1954, it is now called the Yang–Mills theory. It is a so-called local “Non-Abelian
gauge theory”, an extension of quantum electrodynamics local “Abelian gauge the-
ory”.
Yang–Mills theory can be regarded as an extension of Weyl’s gauge electromag-
netic theory. But, according to the symmetry, the Yang–Mills ﬁeld, like the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, cannot have mass. That is to say, the three gauge quanta of the
Yang–Mills ﬁeld should have no mass like photons, which greatly affects the practical
application of the Yang–Mills ﬁeld. In the 1950s, Yang–Mills gauge theory received
little attention.
When Chen-Ning Yang visited Princeton, he gave a special report on his work
with Mills. Wolfgang Pauli was also visiting Princeton at that time. Not long after the
presentation began, as soon as Yang had written the ﬁeld equation on the blackboard,
Pauli asked, “what is the mass of the ﬁeld?” Yang said, “we don’t know”, and went
on. But, Pauli persisted in asking the same question again. “This is a very complex

632
X. Wang
problem, and although we have studied it, we have not come to a deﬁnite conclusion”,
Yang answered. Pauli replied obstinately, “This is not a sufﬁcient justiﬁcation”.
Pauli’s question was: since electromagnetic ﬁelds have no rest mass, the gauge ﬁeld
should also have no mass, but it must have mass in order to explain the short-range
forces associated with the nucleus.
That “mass issue” has haunted Chen-Ning Yang ever since. Mr. Chen-Ning Yang,
who has pursued symmetry and theoretical elegance through all his life, might not
have realized that the solution required an effect of “spontaneous breaking of sym-
metry”, which is common in nonlinear systems.
It wasn’t until the 1960s and 1970s when spontaneous symmetry-breaking and
the emergence of Higgs mechanism led Wilhelm Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow and
Tammam Salam to develop a uniﬁed theory of electroweak interaction. The work
that won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1979, 1999 and 2004, respectively, was based
on the Yang–Mills ﬁeld that the Yang–Mills gauge theory eventually became the
basis for the uniﬁcation of the strong, the weak, and the electromagnetic ﬁelds.

From Symmetry to Symmetry-Breaking
2.1
How the World Governed by Simple Symmetrical Laws of
Physics Can Produce Rich and Complex Phenomena?
The unity of the world requires the symmetry of the laws of physics. What about the
diversity of the world? Symmetry, to some extent, means indistinguishability, con-
sistency, and repetition. For a snowﬂake, one only needs to know one sixth because
the rest is a repeat. But our world is so rich and colorful, and so complex and diverse.
Can an intrinsically symmetrical law of physics really describe this complex, multi-
colored world?
Here, we will combine some of the latest concepts in nonlinear dynamical sys-
tems and chaos theory to explore the question 11 how can the world governed by
symmetrical laws of physics produce colorful phenomena?” We attempt to answer
this question by means of the latest concept in chaos theory, “coexistence of multiple
attractors”. Since the world is a complex nonlinear system, multi-stability may occur
in nonlinear systems, which is the source of the unity and diversity of the world. The
problem of “God particle and the origin of mass”, as we will see, is essentially the
problem of multi-stability. Multi-stability can be said to be the unity and diversity of
the world, for it is “mysterious with mysterious, the door of many wonderful”.
2.2
Spontaneous Breaking of Symmetry
The direct breaking of symmetry in physical laws is something that physicists do not
want to see, which would mean that the laws of physics are not perfect. In addition

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
633
to the direct breaking of symmetry due to the nonlinear nature of the equations
of motion, there may be a situation where the laws of physics themselves remain
symmetrical, but the symmetry laws produce an asymmetry phenomenon, which is
something physicists can accept.
Spontaneous symmetry-breaking is when the laws of nature that govern a physical
system have some symmetry, but a physical phenomenon itself does not have such
symmetry. In particle physics, it usually means that the Lagrangian of a physical
system (a function that generalizes the dynamic state of the whole system) has some
symmetry, while the ground state of a vacuum (the lowest energy order of the system)
does not.
In fact, symmetry still exists in the underlying laws of physics, so it’s actually
hidden.
The simplest spontaneous breaking of symmetry. A cylindrical elastic rod will
stand on the table, with the match stick and gravity, and the desktop system with the
cylindrical elastic rod has the axis of rotational symmetry. If the cylinder is pressed
vertically downward, it must be unstable and will always bend in one direction
or another, pointing in a particular direction and breaking the previous rotational
symmetry. Although this is a simple example, it shows the process of changing the
equilibrium point from stable to unstable and at the same time producing numerous
new equilibrium states, which is a typical bifurcation phenomenon in chaos theory.
Spontaneous symmetry-breaking in a paramagnetic ferromagnetic phase
transition. With the increase of temperature, the magnetism of ferromagnet will
decrease gradually. Over a certain temperature, the magnetism completely disap-
pears. At this temperature, as long as there is no external magnetic ﬁeld, the magnet
cannot produce its own magnetic ﬁeld, so the ferromagnetic has become param-
agnetic. This transition temperature is called the Curie temperature. At Curie tem-
peratures, magnets tend to be isotropic (except for certain special materials), where
physical systems have great symmetries. Macroscopically, the material has no mag-
netism at this time, so there is no speciﬁc direction. When the temperature is lowered,
the magnet restores its magnetism. If there is no external magnetic induction, the
direction of the recovered magnetic ﬁeld will be random, due to the previous state
where there is no particular direction. The material restores the magnetic ﬁeld, indi-
cating that it has chosen a particular direction internally as a particular direction of
the system. Symmetry is no longer maintained. This phase transition, from the state
of symmetry, automatically changed to the state of asymmetry, is the spontaneous
breaking of symmetry.
Crystal symmetry. The laws that describe solids are invariant throughout the
Euclidean group, but solids themselves break the Euclidean group into space groups.
Imagine simply that liquid water is more symmetrical, and loses some of its sym-
metry when it freezes or forms snowﬂakes. And all sorts of speciﬁc symmetries are
subgroups of the three-dimensional space.

634

2.3
Spontaneous Symmetry-Breaking in the Condensed
Matter Physics
The phase states of most matters can be understood through the view of spontaneous
symmetry-breaking. For example, a crystal is formed by an arrangement of atoms in
a periodic matrix, which is not invariant for all translation transformations, but only
for some translation transformations with lattice vectors as intervals. The magnetic
north and south poles of a magnet point in a particular direction, breaking rotational
symmetry. In addition to these common examples, there are many other symmetry-
breaking states, including nematic phases of liquid crystals, superﬂuids, and so on.
A similar Higgs mechanism is used in condensed matter to create the supercon-
ductor effect of the metal. In metal, the condensed state of the electron cooper pair
spontaneously breaks the U(1) symmetry of the electromagnetic force, creating a
superconductor effect.
The phase states of most substances, such as crystals, magnets, and ordinary
superconductors, can be understood from the Spontaneous symmetry-breaking point
of view. Substances of topological phases such as fractional quantum hall effects are
notable exceptions.
2.4
Spontaneous Breaking of Discrete Symmetry in Particle
Physics
The vacuum of quantum mechanics is different from the vacuum of general knowl-
edge. In quantum mechanics, a vacuum is not an empty space, and virtual particles
are continually randomly generated and annihilated at any point in the space, creating
mysterious quantum effects. When these quantum effects are taken into account, the
lowest energy state in space is the lowest energy state of all, which has no additional
energy to generate particles, otherwise known as the ground state or the vacuum
state. Space in the lowest energy state is the vacuum of quantum mechanics.
Suppose that a symmetric group transformation can only transform the lowest
energy state into itself, and the lowest energy state is said to be invariant under the
transformation. The assumption that the Lagrangian of a physical system is invariant
under a symmetric group transformation G does not mean that its lowest energy state
is invariant under the transformation G. A physical system is said to have congruent
symmetry if Lagrangian has the same invariance as the lowest energy state. If only the
Lagrangian has invariance and the lowest energy state does not satisfy, the symmetry
of the physical system is broken spontaneously, or the symmetry of the physical
system is hidden, a phenomenon known as “spontaneous symmetry-breaking”.
A common example can be used to explain the spontaneous symmetry-breaking
phenomenon. Suppose that there is a ball on the top of the sombrero. The sphere is
in a state of rotational symmetry with local maximum gravitational potential energy.
This state is so unstable that a small disturbance can cause the ball to tumble to the

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
635
bottom of the hat in order to reduce its potential energy. The symmetry is broken
because the direction in which the ball rolls is different from the other directions. The
Lagrangian of the physical system is invariant under the rotational transformation, but
the lowest energy state is not invariant, hence this phenomenon is named spontaneous
symmetry-breaking.
The best way to understand the meaning of these visual metaphors is through
speciﬁc mathematical expressions.

The only residue lies in the relationship between the three coefﬁcients in the upper
form, which in a particular way depends only on two parameters. This is the simplest
example of a spontaneous break in symmetry.

where α is a real constant.

This equation has inﬁnitely many solutions corresponding to points on the cir-
cumference of a circle whose radius is

2 on the Φ complex plane, so now vacuum
has inﬁnite degeneracy, and physical vacuum is only one of them.
The phase transformation of the ﬁeld Φ corresponds to a rotation of the ﬁeld in the
complex plane of Φ. In this rotation, the degenerate vacuum changes from one state
to another. In this model of a complex scalar ﬁeld, where the physical vacuum takes
a particular phase, the symmetry of the ﬁeld Φ is broken spontaneously. The above
equation shows that the ﬁeld still has a certain average value of
v

state, but what was measured in the experiment is only based on the excitation of the
average value. We can isolate the mean and study the excitation relative to the mean:

(57)
where

As can be seen, the ﬁeld ϕ has a mass proportional to the expected value of the

λv2, which is called the Higgs particle.
On the other hand, after separating the ﬁelds with an average value of V , we get
a massless ρ ﬁeld. A spontaneous break in continuous symmetry must lead to the
existence of massless particles. This general conclusion is known as the Goldstone
theorem. The massless ﬁeld is called the Goldstone ﬁeld, and the corresponding
particle is called the Goldstone particle. We note that for discrete symmetry Z2, there
is no Goldstone particle, but for continuous symmetry U(1), there is a Goldstone
particle. Inphysics, thespontaneous breakingof thecontinuous symmetryleads tothe
continuous degeneracy of the ground state, and the conversion of the system between

638
X. Wang
the degeneracy states does not need any exchange of energy, so the corresponding
Goldstone particles cannot have mass.
2.6
Higgs Mechanism and the Origin of Mass
In the section on symmetry, it was said that the electromagnetic force is completely
determined by the local symmetry principle. In order to satisfy the gauge theory,
one has to set the mass of the gauge Boson to zero. On the other hand, according to
the Goldstone theorem, a spontaneous break in continuous symmetry must lead to
the existence of massless particles. There are two zero-mass problems, and they are
magically curing each other. This is the Higgs mechanism.
We now analyze the two-zero mass problem. The massless particle of the Gold-
stone theorem is a global continuous symmetry. If we break the local symmetry, it
will be free from the Goldstone theorem. The Yang–Mills theory has a local sym-
metry, but the symmetry here is not broken. So, if we let this local gauge break
spontaneously, then perhaps we can save the Yang–Mills theory. We may put the two
together, namely, using local symmetry to rescue the Goldstone particle and using
symmetry-breaking to rescue the Yang–Mills theory, and furthermore let sponta-
neous symmetry-breaking get rid of the local symmetry that produces the massless
vector particles. In this way, Yang–Mill’s theory would be out of the woods, and since
the symmetry in Yang–Mill’s theory is not global but local, the Goldstone theorem
would not apply to the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry, which would be the
best situation for both worlds.
In the standard model, Higgs mechanism is a mass generation mechanism that
allows the fundamental particles to gain mass. Why do Fermions, W-Bosons, and Z-
Bosons have mass, while photons and gluons have zero mass? The Higgs mechanism
would explain that. Higgs mechanism with gauge theory and spontaneous symmetry-
breaking can generate the mass of particles. This is the simplest of all possible
mechanisms that can generate the mass of gauge Boson while at the same time
adhering to gauge theory.
According to the Higgs mechanism, Higgs ﬁeld is all over the universe, and some
of the fundamental particles gain mass by interacting with the Higgs ﬁeld. But there
is also a byproduct, the Higgs Boson. Since the Higgs ﬁeld vacuum expectation is not
equal to zero, the resulting spontaneous symmetry-breaking, when the continuous
symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the gauge Boson gains mass, both produce
the Higgs Boson with mass and a zero-mass Boson called the Goldstone Boson. By
choosing an appropriate gauge, the Goldstone Boson will be offset, leaving only the
Higgs Boson with mass and the gauge vector ﬁeld with mass.
Fermions also gain masses by interacting with the Higgs ﬁeld, but not in the
same way as the W- and Z-Bosons. In gauge ﬁeld theory, in order to satisfy the
gauge theory, we have to set the mass of the Fermion to zero. By Yukawa coupling,
Fermions also gain masses because of their spontaneous symmetry-breaking. So, in

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
639
the end, the masses of all the elementary particles in the standard model come from
the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry.
2.7
Electroweak Uniﬁcation
In 1979, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences decided to award the Nobel Physics
PrizetoAmericanPhysicistsSheldonGlashow,StevenWeinbergandPakistaniphysi-
cist Abdus Salam in recognition of their outstanding contributions to electroweak
uniﬁcation. The theory of electroweak uniﬁcation is one of the greatest achievements
of this century. The uniﬁed theory for achieving this weak electromagnetic effect is
gauge theory. The gauge theory was proposed by Chen-Ning Yang and Mills in
1954, but no substantial progress had been made ever since because of the problem
in regulating particle mass. It was only in the 1960s that the spontaneous breaking of
vacuum symmetry gave new life to the Yang–Mills theory. The electroweak uniﬁed
theory uses the Yang–Mills theory to describe the fundamental interactions on the
one hand, and the spontaneous breaking of vacuum symmetry on the other, to provide
the mass of gauge particles. So, the spontaneous breaking of symmetry indeed plays
an important role in history.
2.8
Chiral Symmetry-Breaking and the Origin of Quark Mass
Chiral symmetry-breaking refers to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry
of the strong interaction, a form of spontaneous symmetry-breaking. The simplest
example of a Chiral symmetry is the mirror symmetry of the left and the right hands.
In the quantum chromodynamics, assuming that the quark has zero mass (which is
the chiral limit), the Chiral symmetry holds. The quarks, however, have no real mass
of zero, although the masses of the upper and lower quarks are small compared with
those of the hadrons, so the chiral symmetry can be considered “approximately sym-
metric”. Because in a quantum chromodynamics vacuum, the vacuum expectation
value of antiquark-quark condensation is not equal to zero, which causes the chiral
symmetry of the physical system to be spontaneously broken. This also means that
the vacuum of the quantum chromodynamics will mix both chiral states of the quark,
causing quarks to move through the vacuum to gain effective mass.
According to the Goldstone boson, when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously
broken, a zero mass boson is produced, called a Goldstone boson. The chiral sym-
metry is also continuously symmetric, and its Goldstone boson is the π meson. If
the chiral symmetry is completely symmetric, then the mass of the meson is zero;
but, because the chiral symmetry is approximately symmetric, the π meson has a
very small mass, an order of magnitude smaller than the mass of a hadron. This
theory became the basis and element for the later Higgs mechanism of electroweak
symmetry-breaking.

640
X. Wang
According to cosmology, chiral phase transitions occur for 10−6 s after the Big
Bang, at the beginning of the hadronic period, as the universe continued to cool, and
the temperature dropped below a critical point K Tc ≈173MeV. The original chiral
symmetry in physical systems no longer had this property, and the chiral symmetry
was spontaneously broken. Until then, the quarks could not form hadron bound
states and the vacuum expectation of the antiquark-quark condensation. The order
parameter of the physical system was equal to zero, and the physical system obeyed
the chiral symmetry. After that point, the quarks could form hadron bound states, the
vacuum expectation of antiquark-quark condensation was not equal to zero, and the
chiral symmetry was spontaneously broken.

Chaos Revolution
3.1
Stability and Chaos
We consider several possible ﬁnal states of a deterministic motion when time tends
to inﬁnity, for example, in the case where the solution of a three-dimensional
autonomous system. The simplest case being divergence to inﬁnity or convergence
to a point of equilibrium, or periodic and quasi-periodic motions. Each of these pos-
sibilities is simple and a little more prosaic than the variety of our real world. In fact,
if the equations were nonlinear, the situations might be different.
If the equations of a three-dimensional autonomous system are nonlinear, in addi-
tion to the above possibilities, there is also a possibility that they do not diverge but
are restricted to a limited region, or do not converge to any equilibrium point, or do
not periodically traverse. An orbit in this situation will have a very complex motion
rather than just diverging, converging or repeating. This is the situation of chaos,
which is sometimes described as a periodic motion with an inﬁnite period or as
seemingly random. Deterministic chaotic motion has its own unique characteristics,
as discussed in the following sections.
3.2
Uniﬁcation of Initial Value Sensitivity and Initial Value
Desensitization
The so-called butterﬂy effect, which is the sensitivity of chaotic systems to initial val-
ues, is not the same as the initial value sensitivity of divergent systems. A divergence
system also has the property that a small initial value error can be enlarged as the
trajectory diverges to inﬁnity, for example two straight lines with a little difference in
their slopes will further separate away after the straight lines extend indeﬁnitely. This
kind of initial value sensitivity is not the nature of chaos. In fact, chaos is bounded,
which means that there is a region containing a chaotic attractor. Once its trajectory

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
641
falls into this region, it will always be restricted to be within this region, and its
trajectory will not go out of the region. So, on a large scale, chaotic systems are
somewhat “stable”.
On the one hand, chaos is very sensitive to initial values, where two trajectories
that differ a little at the start will be farther apart with the evolution of time, but the
trajectories will approach a chaotic attractor. In fact, for a classical system with only
one chaotic attractor, the ﬁnal trajectory always hovers over the attractor no matter
where the initial value is, as long as it is in the so-called “basin of attraction”. So, this
is a kind of “insensitive” to initial values, to some extent. Because no matter what
initial value the trajectory starts from the basin of attraction, its ﬁnal state is pretty
close to each other near the attractor. In other words, the evolution of the motion
has forgotten about the initial value. These two effects constitute a dialectical unity
of initial sensitivity and initial desensitization. Therefore, the “sensitivity to initial
value” property of chaos is more subtle than just being a divergent system.
3.3
Unity of Essence Certainty and Appearance Randomness
Einstein once said something interesting: “Quantum mechanics is really impressive.
But something inside me told me that it wasn’t the right theory. This theory says a
lot, but it doesn’t lead us any closer to God’s secrets. In any case, I am convinced
that God does not play dice”. What Einstein was talking about here is whether the
laws of physics that describe the way the world works are random. I don’t think that
Einstein himself would object to being able to describe some phenomena as random,
but here he referred to the question of whether the fundamental laws of nature are
random.
Can physical laws be inherently random? Apart from the randomness of the col-
lapse of the wave function in what is now called quantum mechanics, is there any
intrinsic randomness in the laws of physics? The mechanical motion of the dice is
completely deterministic. Can computers generate real randomness? What is really
random? The so-called “computer on all the random simulation” is merely pseudo-
random. In fact, in theory, all systems are deterministic, randomness is only the
appearance, which is an expedient way to deal with the problem. For example, when
you throw a dice, if you know exactly all the initial conditions, then all the details
of the motion of the dice can be precisely determined. But since this information is
physically unavailable, without caring about all the details of the motion, only the
ﬁnal orientation after the landing is stable. So, it’s easy to look at this in a simpler
way, where the orientation is random, 1/6 of the chance, so one can use a random
model to describe this kind of random phenomenon, but the underlying physics is
completely deterministic. To produce “real” randomness, it is necessary to create
extremely highly complex physical systems.
Can an essentially deterministic equation describe a seemingly random phe-
nomenon? Chaos gives a deﬁnite answer: as a deﬁnite differential equation, the

642
X. Wang
state of its motion has some kind of “random” behavior; that is, the randomness
generated spontaneously by the nonlinearity in the chaotic system.
Thus, I think the conclusion is very dialectical: the real randomness comes from
completely deterministic systems. If we do not believe in the complete certainty of
the nature of the laws of physics, we cannot believe that we use a random method to
describe a random phenomenon superﬁcially.
Without certainty, there is no randomness.
3.4
Unity of Integer-Dimensional and
Fractional-Dimensional Attractors
As mentioned above, the essence of chaos is not the so-called “sensitivity to initial
values”. In fact, the difference between chaos and stability is essentially the difference
in the structures of attractors, which is a leap from the integer dimension to the
fractional dimension.
The so-called stable solution is a zero-dimensional point attractor; the so-called
periodic attractor, generally refers to the stable periodic solution, is actually a one-
dimensional line attractor. In a higher-dimensional phase space, a two-dimensional
attractor can be generated; that is, an attractor that forms a torus on which quasi-
periodic solution can be generated.
In a three-dimensional phase space, the attractor must have a dimension smaller
than three, so there seems to be no possibility other than zero-dimensional point
attractors, one-dimensional line attractors, and two-dimensional torus attractors. The
magic of chaos is that its attractor can be fractal; that is, the attractor can have a
fractional dimension, between 2 and 3, giving rise to inﬁnite possibilities.
The geometry of integer dimension is simple. Compared to the traditional geom-
etry for the study of the integer dimension, such as zero-dimensional points, one-
dimensional lines, two-dimensional surface, three-dimensional solid, fractal geom-
etry is much more complex. The fractal dimension indicates that the chaotic motion
state has a multi-leaf and multi-layer structure, and the ﬁner the leaf layer is, the more
self-similar the structure of the inﬁnite layer appears. Therefore, fractal geometry is
also called “the geometry of nature”.
What are the dimensions? The nature of the dimension is inseparable from the
measurement. Here is an example of the concept of fractal dimension. A square, with
its side length enlarged three times, is similar to the original, and is equivalent to
nine small squares. Similarly, one side of a cube grows three times as long, similar to
the original, and the equivalent of 27 small cubes. And that’s where the deﬁnition of
dimension comes in. In the 1970s, the French mathematician Mandelbrot explored
how long the England coastline is. This problem depends on the scale used in the
measurement. If kilometers are used as a unit of measurement, some twists and turns
from a few meters to a few tens of meters will be ignored; if meters are used instead,
the total length measured will increase, but some less than centimeters will not be

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
643
reﬂected. Geometric objects such as coastlines, which have inﬁnite ﬁne structures
and are self-similar, need to be characterized by fractal dimensions.
It’s as if 2 and 3 are just two simple integers, but the space between 2 and 3 is ﬁlled
with an inﬁnite number of real numbers. So is the chaotic attractor, which breaks
through two dimensions, and has inﬁnite possibilities in the vast space between two
and three dimensions.
Chaos, in essence, is leaping of the attractor structure from an integer dimension
to a fractal dimension.
3.5
Unity of Equilibrium and Chaos: Far from Equilibrium
Is equilibrium antithetical to chaos? Is it possible for a system to be both stable and
chaotic? The real world is full of all kinds of equilibria and chaos. Can equilibrium
state and chaos be described in a uniﬁed way?
In statistical mechanics, it is also important to stay far from the equilibrium.
Equilibrium is important, but the world we see is not drab and dead, but alive,
evolving and full of life.
New discoveries in chaos science tell us that equilibrium and chaos are not oppo-
site, but can often coexist. If we consider three-dimensional continuous autonomous
systems, chaotic attractors are generally considered to appear in systems with at least
one unstable saddle-focus type equilibrium point. And all the known classical chaotic
systems do meet this condition. The known classical three-dimensional continuous
autonomous chaotic systems (including classical Lorenz system, Chen System, Lü
system, Rössler system, Sprott systems) can be used by Šil’nikov criteria to study the
existence of chaos and explain the mechanism of chaos. Based on the unstable saddle
focus equilibrium point of the system, the existence of an attractor is deduced from
the self-intersection of a homoclinic orbit or heteroclinic orbit. Šil’nikov theorem
shows that a system with a saddle-type equilibrium point can produce chaos under
certain conditions, yet this is a sufﬁcient but not a necessary condition for chaos to
occur. On the other hand, the Hartman–Grobman theorem strictly states that if the
hyperbolic equilibrium of a nonlinear system is stable, the dynamic behavior near
the equilibrium is also asymptotically stable. But this theorem makes no provision
for the dynamic behavior far away from the equilibrium. Therefore, the possibility
of chaos appearing in a three-dimensional autonomous system with no or only one
stable equilibrium point is not ruled out. Based on these considerations, Xiong Wang
and Guanrong Chen constructed a chaotic system with only one stable equilibrium
point, and the mathematical model of the system is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = yz + a
˙y = x2 −y
˙z = 1 −4x

644
X. Wang
Fig. 1 There is one and only one stable equilibrium point in the chaotic system with a = 0.01.
The left diagram shows the coexistence of three types of attractors. Green is the stable equilibrium
point, red is the stable periodic orbit, and blue is the chaotic attractor. On the right, the X-Z initial
value plane of the three different attractors is cut off. The green region is the region of attraction for
the stable equilibrium point, the red region for the periodic orbit, and the blue region for the chaotic
attractor
This result also attracted the attention of J. C. Sprott and his colleagues, and they
cooperated in investigating the interesting dynamics of the system. They found that,
besides the stable equilibrium point and the chaotic attractor, the system also has a
periodic orbit with a small region of attraction. Three different types of attractors
coexist in such a simple system, where each of these different attractors has its own
complex domain of attraction. The whole phase space is thus divided by several
attractors, whose respective domains of attraction are interwoven with each other,
which may even have very complicated fractal boundaries. Moreover, these domains
of attraction vary with the system parameters as shown in Fig.1.
These new ﬁndings show that chaotic dynamics do not depend on the number and
the stability of the local equilibrium points, and chaos is a global dynamic behavior
of nonlinear systems. This kind of global chaotic dynamic behavior is also referred
to as “hidden attractor”. The traditional chaotic attractor is self-excited due to the
existence of homoclinic and/or heteroclinic orbits at the unstable equilibrium point. If
the equilibrium point is stable or there is no equilibrium point in the chaotic system,
the region of attraction of the chaotic attractor does not contain any equilibrium
point, so starting from any initial value may not be attracted to the chaotic attractor;
or, the region of attraction of this kind of chaotic attractor is extremely small, so
if we start from somewhere near the stable equilibrium point, we may not ﬁnd the
chaotic attractor in numerical simulations. A hidden attractor is essentially a large-
scale dynamical characteristic of such a nonlinear system that does not depend on
local equilibrium points. The research on this kind of newly-found chaotic system
with hidden attractors has become overwhelming recently.

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
645
What is it that makes our world so vivid and colorful? I believe that it is a complex
structure, such as life, arising from chaotic state far from an equilibrium, which has
countless possibilities.
3.6
Coexisting Attractors
The focus of this book is about multi-stability, which traditionally refers to a dynamic
system with multiple stable equilibrium points. But, what we’re really talking about
here is the coexistence of multiple attractors, or even the coexistence of different
types of attractors.
A classical chaotic system usually has only one chaotic and a global attractor,
so the symmetry of the equation determines the symmetry of the chaotic attractor.
General research focuses on the analyses of the equilibrium point, power spectrum,
Poincaré cross section, bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponent spectrum, and
so on. Unlike classical chaotic systems, some newly-found chaotic systems often
have many different attractors, even many different types of attractors, to coexist,
where different initial values may lead to different attractors.
In this case, if the equation is symmetric, the solution of the equation, as well
as the ﬁnal or observable state of the solution, cannot be symmetric. That actually
is a novel dynamical behavior of spontaneous symmetry-breaking, which is rare for
classical systems to have, yet for the new chaotic systems it is quite common.
For classical dynamical equations, the attractors derived from the evolution of the
system also maintain the symmetry. The classical Lorenz system and Chen system
both satisfy the Z-rotational symmetry, for example the Lorenz system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = σ (y −x)
˙y = rx −y −xz
˙z = −bz + xy ,
(61)
which is chaotic when σ = 10, r = 28, b = 8
3, and the Chen system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = a(y −x)
˙y = (c −a)x −xz + cy
˙z = −bz + xy ,
(62)
which is chaotic when a = 35, b = 3, c = 28.
The equations of these systems satisfy the Z-axis symmetry; that is, when
(X, Y, Z) is transformed to (−X, −Y, Z), the equation form remains unchanged.
And each of these related systems produces an attractor with the same symmetry.
In general, the equations with the Z-axis symmetry satisfy the following general
formula:

646

⎧

⎩
˙x = a11x + a12y
˙y = a21x + a22y + m1xz + m2yz
˙z = a33z + m3xy + m4x2 + m5y2 + m6z2 + c ,
(63)
Based on this general formula, we found the following system:
⎧
⎨
⎩
˙x = −x + y
˙y = −x −0.1y −yz
˙z = −0.5z + x2 −k ,
(64)
where k is a real parameter.
What is interesting about this system is that, as the k changes, the system goes
from one countervailing attractor spontaneously breaking down into two attractors,
both of which lose the symmetry of the original system of the equation, as shown in
Fig.2.
How to judge whether an attractor will keep symmetry from the equation itself?
What is special about the critical state of spontaneous breaking of symmetry? And
how to predict it? These are some new challenging problems faced by the classical
chaos theory.

all the states in space, so multi-stability does not emphasize the diversity caused

by different laws. What is emphasized is that the same set of physical laws can
produce different observable phenomena. The dream of physicists is to build the
ultimate uniﬁed equation that describes the whole world, whether it is a macroscopic
universe on a very large scale, or an elementary particle world on a very small scale,
or the ordinary world of everyday’s life, or extreme situation such as black holes.
Our dream is one universe, one equation.
4.2
Vacuum and the Ground State of a System
The so-called spontaneous symmetry-breaking, in the language of quantum ﬁeld
theory, is that the Lagrangian of a physical system has some symmetry, but the
ground state does not. In other words, the ground state of the system breaks the
symmetry of the equation of motion. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the ground state of
the system is a vacuum state, so the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of the system
shows that the symmetry of the Lagrangian is broken by the vacuum state.
The central idea here is the deﬁnition of vacuum, which is the ground state of the
system. Throughout the years, people have been unremittingly exploring the vacuum,
and they have gone through a circuitous, tortuous long road. At present, based on
quantum ﬁeld theory, the concept of “vacuum is the ground state of a quantum ﬁeld
system” has become a profound basic concept veriﬁed by experiments in modern
physics. Quantum ﬁeld theory says that the presence of a particle in space indicates
that the ﬁeld is in an excited state, while the absence of a particle indicates that the
quantum is in the ground state. Thus, in quantum ﬁeld theory, vacuum is regarded
as a state without any excitation; that is, vacuum is the ground state of the quantum
ﬁeld system.
If the lowest ground state of the system is unique, then the vacuum state has the
same symmetry as the interaction. Such a vacuum is called an ordinary vacuum or
a normal vacuum. If the lowest energy ground state of a system is not one, that
is, the symmetry of the actual physical state does not reﬂect the symmetry of the
interaction. This phenomenon is called the spontaneous breaking of the vacuum
symmetry. Symmetry-breaking is a new type of vacuum that is very different from
the normal vacuum. This theory of spontaneous breaking of vacuum symmetry is
not an idle dream without practical signiﬁcance. In fact, it plays a very important
role in the completion of the electroweak theory, which has been proved by a lot
of experiments and is, of course, strong support for the vacuum theory. The theory
of spontaneous breaking of vacuum symmetry has a profound inﬂuence not only on
high energy physics, but also on astrophysics and solid state physics.

At the Heart of Higgs Mechanism Is the Concept of
Multi-stability
The vacuum state of a physical system is determined by the Lagrangian. Why doesn’t
it have the symmetry of the Lagrangian? The secret is that many physical systems

648
X. Wang
have degenerate vacuum states, and if we think of all these degenerate vacuum states
as a set, it does indeed have the same symmetry as the Lagrangian. However, the
actual vacuum state of a physical system is only one state in the set, which often does
not have the symmetry of the whole set, which results in the break of symmetry—that
is, the spontaneous break of symmetry.
This is even clearer in the language of nonlinear dynamical systems, where the
equilibrium or attractor of a dynamical system is determined by a dynamical equa-
tion. Why doesn’t it have the symmetry of the dynamical equation? The secret is
that some dynamical systems have multiple attractors that coexist. If we think of
all the attractors as a set, it still has the same symmetry as the dynamic equation,
but the real observation of a trajectory and the attractor lose the symmetry of the
whole dynamic equation. This may be a more direct demonstration of spontaneous
symmetry-breaking.
4.4
Chaos Theory Beyond the Higgs Mechanism?
Chen-Ning Yang was not involved in the study of the Higgs mechanism, and I don’t
think Chen-Ning Yang’s aesthetic would have been too happy with such a solution.
Nor do I personally believe that the Higgs mechanism is a satisfactory answer to the
question of the origin of mass. Let’s compare the two theories which both reform the
Lagrangian: the local gauge principle and the Higgs mechanism. The reformation of
Lagrangian from local gauge principle is very clear, profound and concise. The prin-
ciple does not require real natural experimental observations such as the experience
of electromagnetic ﬁelds, but directly from the requirements of the principle, which
deduced that there must be an electromagnetic ﬁeld. This top-down high-altitude
derivation reﬂects the power of the principle. The Higgs mechanism, on the other
hand, knows from experimental experience that the weak interaction’s gauge particle
has mass, and artiﬁcially transforms the Lagrangian to require the introduction of an
extra Higgs term. This term describes neither the particles of matter nor the particles
that interact with each other, but rather, the production of mass purely for the purpose
of breaking symmetry.
So, what is the origin of mass? The Higgs mechanism’s answer, in a sense, is
not so much an answer to a question rather than shifting it. It shifts the mass of
elementary particles to the vacuum expectation of the Higgs ﬁeld, the gauge coupling
constant, and the Yukawa coupling constant, which we still want to understand. And,
this transference, instead of becoming simpler and clearer in principle, is becoming
more complex, and there is no actual reduction. The Yukawa coupling constant,
for example, has an independent value for each type of fermion. Because of the
existence of these parameters, the Lagrangian of the standard model contains no
mass parameters, but the number of free parameters that are directly related to the
mass is no less than the number of mass parameters that need to be explained a little
more.

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
649
Therefore, I would like to believe that the Higgs, and the electroweak uniﬁed
theory of the Higgs, is a phenomenally successful description, and that the idea of
linking mass to the symmetry-breaking property of a vacuum is profound. However,
they cannot be regarded as a satisfactory answer to the question of the origin of mass
because they fail to realize the real reduction of the concept of mass.
My personal guess here is that there is a need for a more powerful principle than
the local gauge symmetry, and a deeper understanding of vacuum. Based on the idea
of multi-stability in chaos theory, perhaps we can get a more satisfying answer. At
that time, the Higgs mechanism will not have to be added artiﬁcially, but rather,
as a result of a more powerful principle, a more profound spontaneous breaking
of the symmetry of the multi-stability effect. Thus, the Higgs mechanism is only a
phenomenological approximation of the new mechanism.

Sources of Diversity in the World
How can the uniﬁed physical law produce all the colorful phenomena? Is an equation
enough to describe such a colorful world? After the chaos revolution, we became
more convinced of the problem because we knew more about how complex nonlinear
equations can be. If, in the end, all physical phenomena can be expressed in one
equation, it is necessary that this uniﬁed equation has a very rich connotation.
We summarize the top 10 reasons why a uniﬁed law of physics may produce
all colorful phenomena and make wild guesses about the equations of the ultimate
uniﬁed theory of physics that may be discovered in the future. We also make a
summary of this chapter, also the end of the book.
5.1
Physical Quantity: Different Observers Can Have
Different Observation Results
First, there is a wealth of variables that describe the states of motion of physical
systems. The state of a physical system requires ﬁrst determining the external space-
time, the internal gauge symmetry, and then the physical quantities that describe the
state of the system, whether it is a tensor or a spinor, a geometric quantity or an
operator, or something more general.
In special relativity, for example, observers of different inertial frames of reference
have different observations of the time interval and space interval between events,
and even the sequence of time. But both will observe a uniform space-time interval
behind it. So, a physical quantity describing the system is a covariant vector or tensor,
and at this time the physical quantity already has the rich connotation. Observers with
different motions can obtain very different observation results. For example, from the
equations of motion of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, different observers get seemingly

650
X. Wang
different physical laws, where some observers see the electric side, some observers
see the magnetic side.
In the future uniﬁed equation, the variable describing the motion state of the
physical system itself, which has enough rich connotation, is the uniﬁed objective
physical quantity that does not depend on the observer to describe the observer in all
different motion states. This quantity should be some kind of generalization of the
tensor.
At this level, the diversity of the observed phenomena by different observers is
the ﬁrst source, which explains why the same physical equation can produce very
different observed phenomena.
5.2
State Space: Richness and Diversity of Motion States
Secondly, in the ﬁnal equation, all the possible states of the object constitute a state
space. The structure of the state space is very rich and complex. The state space
itself may be nontrivial, nonlinear, and even with a complex topology. In the classic
Newtonian framework of physics, a particle moves in a 3D, and the State of the
particle includes the position of the particle and the velocity of the particle. The state
space is equal to the real three-dimensional space, plus the velocity space. In classical
Newton mechanics, all possible states of motion make up a relatively simple space.
But, when it comes to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the physical quantity describ-
ing the motion in the electromagnetic ﬁeld is the electromagnetic vector ﬁeld. The
components of the electromagnetic vector potential have different projections to dif-
ferent observers, leading different observers to see different aspects of the uniﬁed
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Maxwell’s equations are as important in electromagnetism as
Newton’s laws of motion is in mechanics. The theory of electromagnetism, centered
at Maxwell’s equations, is one of the proudest achievements in classical physics.
It reveals the perfect uniﬁcation of the electromagnetic force, giving physicists the
belief that various interactions of matter should be uniﬁed at a higher level.
All the possible states of the electromagnetic vector potential form a function
space, which is actually much more complex than the state space of Newton’s
mechanics. General Relativity equates gravity with the curvature of space-time,
where itself is no longer just a container for physical processes but the subject of
dynamics, which describes the motion of space-time in the form of a metric tensor
ﬁeld. The possible states of the metric ﬁeld constitute a complex state space. These
allow the equations to describe very complex and diverse phenomena.

5.3
Ground State: Even the Simplest Vacuum Is Rich in
Content
In the space of all possible states, the simplest state, such as the ground state in a
quantum ﬁeld, can be non-trivial and indeed colorful.
In classical electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, the ﬁeld quantity satisﬁes the partial
differential equation of space coordinates and time, so the classical ﬁeld is charac-
terized by continuity. According to the principle of quantum physics, micro-objects
have the duality of particle and wave, discrete and continuous. In elementary quantum
mechanics, the description of electron is quantum, and the motion of a single elec-
tron is quantized by introducing the operator corresponding to electron coordinates,
momentum and their commutative relation. But its description of electromagnetic
ﬁelds is still classic. Such a theory does not reﬂect the particle nature of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld and cannot accommodate photons, not to mention the generation
and annihilation of photons. Thus, elementary quantum mechanics, while providing
a good description of the structure of atoms and molecules, cannot directly deal with
such important phenomena as spontaneous emission and absorption of light in atoms.
The picture of quantum ﬁeld theory is that the whole space is ﬁlled with different
ﬁelds, which permeate and interact with each other. The excited states of the ﬁeld
are the appearance of particles, and the different excited states are the different
numbers and states of the particles. The interaction of the ﬁeld can cause the change
of the excited state of the ﬁeld, which is represented by various reaction processes
of the particles. Therefore, quantum ﬁeld theory can describe spontaneous emission
and absorption of light in an atom, as well as the production and annihilation of
various particles in particle physics. Quantum ﬁeld theory is essentially the quantum
mechanics of inﬁnite-dimensional degree-of-freedom systems. In statistical quantum
physics and condensed matter physics, and some other branch of physics, the object
of study is a system of inﬁnite-dimensional degrees of freedom. In these branches,
the degree of freedom of interest is often not the motion of the elementary particle,
but rather, the collective motion of the system, such as ﬂuctuations in a crystal or
quantum liquid. These waves can be thought of as wave ﬁelds, and they obey the
laws of quantum mechanics, so quantum ﬁeld theory can also be applied to these
problems.
In quantum ﬁeld theory, a particle is a quantum excitation of a ﬁeld, and each
particle has its own ﬁeld. The interactions and dynamics among particles can be
described by quantum ﬁeld theory. The so-called vacuum is a physical system in all
possible states of some special state, that is, the lowest energy state. From the above-
described physical meaning of the quantum ﬁeld theory, one can see that vacuum is
notwithoutmatter.Thegroundstateﬁeldhasthecharacteristicofzero-pointvibration
and quantum ﬂuctuation of quantum mechanics. The physical effect of vacuum can be
observed in the experiment when the external conditions are changed. For example,
when a metal plate is placed in a vacuum, the interaction (Casimir effect) between
two uncharged plates is due to the change of the zero point energy of the vacuum,

652
X. Wang
and the polarization of the vacuum is due to the change of the distribution of positive
and negative electrons in the vacuum under the action of the external electric ﬁeld.
The stability of vacuum requires the vacuum to be an attractive subset of the state
space. For different potential functions, a vacuum can be a point in the state space,
such as a zero ﬁeld, where the vacuum is a stable equilibrium point in the state space.
However, nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos theory tell us that such subsets
may have very complicated structures, or even non-trivial topological structures. If
the vacuum is a special subset of the state space, then the vacuum may have some
non-trivial properties such as spontaneous symmetry-breaking.
We suspect that if the vacuum itself is not a simple point or loop, but rather,
some sort of “attractor” of the nontrivial topology, then it will have all sorts of weird
physical effects.
5.4
Nonlinearity: Solutions of Equations Are Rich and
Colorful
The development of general relativity depends to a large extent on how to ﬁnd a
solution to the gravitational ﬁeld equation and its physical interpretation. The solution
of the ﬁeld equation is an important part of Einstein’s theory of gravity. The ﬁeld
equation is a nonlinear second-order partial differential equation with space-time
as the independent variable and metric as the dependent variable. Because of the
nonlinear nature of the equation, it is very difﬁcult to obtain the exact expression of
the solution. It needs to choose different approximate methods in different cases. It is
often assumed that the dosimeter has some speciﬁc simple forms, such as spherically
symmetric form, cylindrical symmetric form, statically ﬁxed and axially symmetric
form, plane waveform, etc.
The nonlinear nature of the Einstein ﬁeld equations makes general relativity very
different from applying other theories of physics. For example, Maxwell’s equations
of electromagnetism are linearly related to the distribution of the electric ﬁeld, mag-
netic ﬁeld, electric charge and electric current (i.e., the linear superposition of the two
solutions is still a solution). Another example is the Schrödinger equation in quan-
tum mechanics, which is also linear for probabilistic wave functions. The solution
of the Einstein ﬁeld equations cannot be simply a linear superposition but requires
a special solution generation technology. The technique of solution generation is
to ﬁnd some transformations and to generate new solutions or solution families by
using known seed solutions. With the development of the “generation technique” of
the solution, the number of exact solutions of the gravitational ﬁeld equation will
be increased greatly, where exact solutions are all special cases. Once encountering
more concrete realistic questions or studying some meaningful questions, one has to
use approximate methods.
There are two such methods that are particularly useful. They are called the post
Newton approximation and the linear approximation. The ﬁrst method is suitable for

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
653
slow-moving particle systems, such as the solar system, which are connected together
by gravity. When particles in a system of particles bound together by gravity move
at low speeds, their states do not deviate much from Newton’s laws. So, Newton’s
solution can be regarded as the zero-order approximation of the general relativity.
Hence, the method is called the post Newton approximation. The theory can be used
to compare general relativity and Newton’s laws, and to test various gravitational
effects in the celestial mechanics. The second method deals with the ﬁeld in a lower-
order approximation but does not assume the matter be in non-relativistic motion, so
it is suitable for dealing with gravitational radiation.
In addition, there is a perturbation method, essentially seeking a new approximate
solution from the strict solution known to us. Speciﬁcally, to ﬁnd a reference system,
the ﬁrst requirement is to be very similar or close to the system under study, and the
second requirement is to be able to solve it precisely. At this point, the difference
between the properties of the studied system and that of the reference system is con-
sidered as a kind of perturbation, which can be approximately calculated according
to the characteristics of the reference system.
Einstein believed that the ﬁnal uniﬁed equation must be nonlinear, where the
nonlinearity means that the equation solutions are complex and diverse, and therefore
can have some solutions and linear superposition generation. Nonlinearity produces
a variety of solutions that correspond to the variety of the real world.
5.5
Approximate Equations: Sources of Theoretical Diversity
in Different Physics
The development of physics is that the laws of seemingly different phenomena in
different ﬁelds are uniﬁed into different solutions in the same theoretical equation.
The primary separated laws are only one aspect of the ultimate high-level uniﬁed
law. The elementary equations are approximations of the general equations under
speciﬁc conditions.
In the case of the theory of electromagnetism, Maxwell’s equations were not dis-
covered by Maxwell himself but on the basis of his predecessors’ summary of the
basic laws of electromagnetic phenomena. Oersted, Ampere, and some others pro-
posed the theory that electric ﬁelds produce magnetic ﬁelds, while Faraday proposed
the theory that magnetic ﬁelds produce electric ﬁelds, Faraday’s law of induction.
On the basis of these theories, Maxwell put forward the hypothesis of “displacement
current”. On this basis, Maxwell’s equations was formed together, and thus electricity
and magnetism reached a complete unity, forming a new theory of electromagnetic
ﬁelds. Gauss’s law describes how electric charges generate electric ﬁelds, Maxwell’s
ampere laws describe how electric currents and time-varying electric ﬁelds gener-
ate magnetic ﬁelds, Faraday’s induction law describes how time-varying magnetic
ﬁelds generate electric ﬁelds, and, ﬁnally, all of them together form the ultimate
electromagnetic ﬁeld equation.

654
X. Wang
A better example is the general relativity, which magically uniﬁed Newton’s two
theoretical systems: Newton’s equations of motion and Newton’s equations of grav-
ity, both as approximations and corollaries of the Einstein ﬁeld equation. Newton’s
gravity and Newton’s mechanics are separate sets of physical notions. Einstein, in
order to make the principle of relativity standing up for itself, suggested the Einstein
ﬁeld equations. What is amazing is that the equation’s description of gravity naturally
takes the form of Newton’s gravity as the limit, and it also has incorporated Newton’s
equations of motion, but generalize it in curved space-time. When Einstein ﬁrst built
the general relativity, he thought that the fundamental equations of the general rela-
tivity had two parts: the ﬁeld equation and the equations of motion. Later, Einstein
and Fokker respectively proved that equations of motion could be derived from ﬁeld
equations, so that there was only one fundamental equation for the general relativity,
the Einstein ﬁeld equation. Newton’s two sets of theoretical systems are thus deeply
uniﬁed by Newton’s true successor, Einstein.
It was thought that the kinetic equation should be attached to the principle of
relativity, but it turned out that instead of this additional “mechanical equation”, the
“mechanics” could be derived directly from the “principle”, which embodied the
power of the principle. The absolute derivative of the Einstein tensor is zero, which
contains abundant information about the motion of the material: for the ideal ﬂuid,
it is the equation of motion of the material ﬁeld; for the ideal ﬂuid whose pressure
is zero, that is dust, the world line of dust can be obtained as the geodesic line. The
world line is also a geodesic line for any object whose gravity is weak enough and
small enough. So, the assumption that the world line of free particles is a geodesic
is no longer an independent basic assumption, where Newton’s mechanics has been
absorbed, as an additional bonus to the general relativity.
In fact, the general relativity is more than an elaborated theory of gravity. The
general relativity is a profound revolution in space-time and matter. The Einstein ﬁeld
equation is only a temporary concrete realization of the general relativity principle.
In Einstein’s words, “I had no doubt for a moment that this ﬁeld equation formulation
was only a stopgap measure in order to give the principle of relativity a preliminary,
self-explanatory representation. Because it is essentially just a theory of gravitational
ﬁeld that has been somewhat artiﬁcially separated from the total ﬁeld whose structure
is not yet known”. Einstein’s ﬁeld equation is also far more intelligent and profound
than Newton’s equations.
In the ﬁnal uniﬁed theory, the equations of motion of physical systems must
be extremely rich, and the existing mechanical equations are uniﬁed equations in
different conditions under various approximations or inferences. In the process of
human recognition of physical laws, various kinds of concrete phenomena have
been preliminarily reﬁned, and various equations in speciﬁc application ranges under
various speciﬁc conditions have been obtained. These equations have been veriﬁed
in their respective conditions and scopes of application, but these are only various
parts and one-side of the underlying uniﬁed theory. Perhaps they all have some
rationality from the phenomenological level. But, from the perspective of theoretical
self-consistency and completeness, they are all problematic. Only by revealing the

Multi-stability: The Source of Unity and Diversity of the World
655
underlying uniﬁed equation can we truly establish a self-consistent and complete
description of nature. Then, we can glimpse the great true beauty.
When I reach the top, I can see all mountains in a single glance.
5.6
Initial Conditions: Sensitivity of Initial Values
In the uniﬁed theory, the Lagrangian, or equation of motion, of a physical system must
be highly nonlinear. Nonlinear equations may generate abundant dynamical behav-
iors, such as strange attractors, multi-stability and chaos, spontaneous breaking of
symmetry, coexistence of multiple attractors, and so on. A typical property of non-
linearity is the sensitivity to initial values, unlike Newton’s equations of mechanics
which are rather monotone. Newton’s equations of gravitation have a slightly richer
set of solutions that can be a variety of conics. For the Einstein ﬁeld equations of the
general relativity, not to mention the wide variety of possible solutions of space-time
structure, the geodesic of kinematics is also very rich. For a straight space-time, the
geodesic line can only be a straight line, but for a curved space-time, the geodesic line
will be very complex and colorful. Different initial conditions may produce various
kinds of colorful solutions, which also make the world full of possibilities. But they
are all governed by the same set of equations.
5.7
Multi-stability: Sources of Symmetry-Breaking and
Diversity of Stable Structures
Another typical characteristic of nonlinear equations is multi-stability. Different ini-
tial values not only have very different evolutionary trajectories but also have com-
pletely different ﬁnal states that may lead to different attractors. An attractor is actu-
ally a stable observable state corresponding to a stable structure, and multi-stability
gives the possibility of many different stable structures under the same equation.
In the Higgs mechanism, where the vacuum state of a physical system is deter-
mined by the Lagrangian, why doesn’t it have the same symmetry as the Lagrangian?
The secret is that many physical systems have degenerate vacuum states. This is even
clearer in the language of nonlinear dynamical systems, where the equilibrium or
attractor of a dynamical system is determined by a dynamical equation. Why doesn’t
it have the symmetry of the dynamical equation? The secret is that some dynamical
systems have multiple attractors that coexist.
We hope that in the ﬁnal uniﬁed equation, the Higgs mechanism is no longer
introduced externally to ﬁnd the origin of mass but is required as a deep princi-
ple. An effect of spontaneously coexisting multiple attractors is due to the inherent
nonlinearity of the equation.

656
X. Wang
5.8
Attractor: Source of Diversity of Stable Structure
Black holes are very complex solutions of general relativity. According to the expe-
rience from chaos theory, it is possible to produce more and more complex solutions
such as black rings and black attractors for general relativity. In addition, these solu-
tions are simple stable structures that could be used to describe elementary particles,
or even to ﬁnd some connection between elementary particles and black holes.
The ﬁnal theory should not be a theory of everything which, like the current
standard models, ties together all the known elementary particles. The theory is a
theory, which should not contain all the details of everything, but it should give a
theoretical prediction of all the possibilities. The attractor itself is rich in topological
structure, which can explain all kinds of elementary particles. We may have a full new
understanding of what is called an elementary particle, and these elementary particles
can be described by some kind of attractors or knots and links on the attractors. But
elementary particles are not fundamental; they are some special stable structures
under some special energy standards.
5.9
Key Parameters: Sources of Phase Transition and
Mutation
In chaos theory, changes in the parameters of an equation can lead to all sorts of inter-
esting system dynamics. Bifurcations are generated by small and continuous changes
in the system parameters (bifurcation parameters), resulting in sudden changes of the
stability or topological structure of the system. Therefore, the ﬁnal uniﬁed equation
may also produce various complex dynamic characteristics under different varying
parameters. For a concrete problem, we choose a parameter to describe the corre-
sponding system characteristic, and the system will produce bifurcation within a
certain parameter change, corresponding to the kind of phase transition in the sys-
tem. This is similar to the fact that water can exist in the form of ice (solid phase),
water (liquid phase) and steam (vapor phase), at different temperatures (parameters).
We all know that at a certain temperature, several phases of water can transform into
each other. Similarly, the attractors mentioned above represent some special stable
structures under certain conditions, and some key parameters represent these “special
conditions”. Under the change of these parameters, the “bifurcation”, “mutation” and
“phase transition”, which are common in the real world, will occur.
Under certain conditions, different vacuum phases will also transform into each
other, which is the vacuum phase transition. Different types of interactions can lead
to different types of vacuum states. So, for the same interaction, different types of
vacuum states may also occur under different conditions. These different states of
vacuum are known as different “vacuum phases” in physics.

5.10
Emerging as a Whole: Complex Behavior Can Occur
from Simple Equations
Chaos theory tells us that, when considering the interaction of a large number of
complex individuals, even if each individual is determined by a simple equation, the
whole system can have very complex behavior. Because the uniﬁed equation is a
complex and profound equation, even more colorful phenomena can emerge.
The so-called emergent property means that this property does not exist in any
single element, and the system is expressed at a low level, but the phenomenon
appears at a high level, so it is called “emergence”. System science believes that
the reason why the system function often appears, as “the whole is greater than the
sum of the parts”, is because the system has emerged a new quality, where “greater
than the part” is the emerging new quality. This emergence of the system behavior is
the result of a nonlinear interaction between some adaptive subjects of the system.
Emergence is a transition from a low level to a high level, in the form of mutation
in performance and organization of the macro system based on the evolution of the
microscopic subject. In this process, new qualities can be generated from old ones.
This often involves the contradiction between the so-called reductionism and holism.
I have no intention to argue about the philosophy here but discuss it from a scientiﬁc
point of view. In fact, both show the same thing, and simple equations can produce
complex phenomena. Compared with the philosophical discussion with nothingness,
it is more important to understand how to ﬁnd the simple equation behind, how to
explore the rich complexity that this simple equation can produce, and so on. These
are all practical scientiﬁc problems.
If you are still skeptical about how simple and profound equations can produce
rich and colorful results, I suggest you play with the Mandelbrot fractals. You can
take a long time to zoom in on any interesting part and keep zooming in. I believe that
you can see the endless magical geometry. If you have tasted Mandelbrot’s fractals,
I think you will be amazed that such a simple equation can produce such a colorful
and endless array of fantastic fractals. The Mandelbrot set is the most bizarre and
most magniﬁcent geometric ﬁgure ever made by mankind. It was once called “the
ﬁngerprint of God”. Such a set of points comes from a very simple iterative formula:
Zn+1 = (Zn)2 + C, as shown in Fig.3.
For nonlinear iterative formulas, all results in an inﬁnite iteration can keep ﬁnite
values with the collection of the plural C, which constitutes the Mandelbrot set.
5.11
After the Uniﬁcation of Physics, the Light of Principle
Will Shine Everywhere
It can be predicted that the ﬁnal uniﬁed equation would be more nonlinear and
complex, and the Einstein ﬁeld equation is only a special approximation of the
uniﬁed equation. Yet, even if the ﬁnal equation is found, it doesn’t mean the end

up approach to the future top-down development. In fact, ﬁnding a solution of the
ﬁnal uniﬁed equation can continue to be studied for hundreds of years, which may
be aided by the enormous computing power and artiﬁcial intelligence technology
generated by the development of computer technology. The future physics will start
from the principal equation, combine the computer modeling and simulation, and
be integrated with the massive data analysis, to solve all kinds of concrete problems
and to solve all kinds of complex problems which previously thought impossible.
The theoretical equations in physics and advanced mathematical theory will be more
deeply involved in materials, chemistry, biology, society and many other scientiﬁc
ﬁelds, which will be a greater manifestation of the power of physical equations. The
light of principle will illuminate all corners of science (Fig.4).

Noether Theorem
There are many quantities in nature that do not evolve over time, named conserved
variables, as evidenced by a large number of experiments.
Therefore, when constructing the Lagrangian quantity that describes the physical
system from the ﬁeld as the starting point, it is necessary to correctly reveal the
conservation law of the system.
At the beginning of the 20th century, German female mathematician Noether
discovered the relationship between continuous symmetry transformation and con-
servation law, which makes it easy to ﬁnd the conservation laws of a physical system
through the interacting Lagrangian form.
Assuming that the interaction cation of the system S is invariant under the contin-
uous transformation of the ﬁeld, in the inﬁnitesimal transformation of the parameters,
one has
X′
μ = xμ + δxμ
(65)
At this time, the amount of ﬁeld ϕa(x) and the Lagrangian density are L

ϕ(x), ∂ϕ
(x)/ ∂xμ

, which will also have a corresponding inﬁnitesimal change as follows:
ϕ′
a

x′
= ϕa(x) + δϕa(x)
(66)
L ′ 
x′
= L (x) + δL (x)
(67)
In the above formula, in order to make the expression concise, the dependence
of the Lagrangian density on the amount of ﬁeld is hidden. Variation of the ﬁeld
quantity deﬁned by the above formula gives
δϕa(x) = ϕ′
a


−ϕa(x)

a(x) −ϕa(x)
= δxϕ′
a + δϕϕa
= ∂ϕa
∂xμ
δxμ + δϕϕa
(68)
In the above formula, the second-order small amount has been neglected. Assume
that the system (the amount of action) remains invariant under the inﬁnitesimal
transformation of space-time coordinates, that is,
δS =

R′ d4x′L ′ 

R
d4xL (x) = 0
(69)
An important conclusion will follow, that is Noether’s theorem. In the above
formula, R′ and R are the integral areas of x′ and x, respectively. Therefore, the

660

change in the amount of action can be expressed as
δS =

R′ d4x′L (x) +

The above equation shows that the system has a corresponding conserved cur-
rents with respect to a continuous symmetry transformation. This current can be
determined by the Lagrangian density of the ﬁeld.
According to the above formula and Gauss’s theorem, one has

Goldstone Theorem
One can write the Lagrangian as follows:
L =

∂μΦ
† (∂μΦ) −V (Φ)
(79)
where Φ is the column vector of the N-dimensional interior space. Assume that the
potential energy V (Φ) has a local minimum at Φ = Φ0, that is,
∂V (Φ)
∂Φa

Φ=Φ0
= 0,
for a = 1, 2, . . . , N
(80)
Expand the ﬁeld near this equilibrium point, so that the potential energy can be
expanded to
V (Φ) = V (Φ0) + 1
2 Mab (Φ −Φ0)a (Φ −Φ0)b + O

(Φ −Φ0)3
(81)

X. Wang
Because Φ = Φ0 is a minimum, the corresponding mass matrix must be non-
negative:
Mab = ∂2V (Φ)
∂Φa∂Φb

Φ=Φ0
≥0
(82)
We want the Lagrangian to be invariant in the rotation of the N-dimensional
interior space, which means that the Lagrangian is invariant in the following trans-
formations:
Φ →Φ′ = UΦ = exp

iθcT c
Φ
(83)
Thus, the Lagrangian is invariable. So, it follows that
V (Φ) = V

Φ′
= V (Φ0) + 1
2 MabδΦaδΦb + · · ·
(84)
where δΦ is Φ0, satisfying the rotation transformation of the above condition. Con-
sequently,
MabδΦaδΦb = 0
(85)
if and only if δΦa = δΦb = 0; thus, Mab ̸= 0. If neither δΦa nor δΦb is zero, then
there must held Mab = 0, that is,
Mab = 0
δΦa ̸= 0
δΦb ̸= 0
(86)
where δΦa is nonzero. This means that the vacuum is degenerate in this dimension,
the symmetry is broken spontaneously, and the rotation invariance of Φa
0 is lost.
Then, there is Maa = 0, and the corresponding physical ﬁeld mass of Φa is zero.
That’s the Goldstone theorem.
It is also shown that the dimension of the zero mass matrix, i.e., the number of
Goldstone particles NG, is equal to the dimension of symmetry-breaking in vacuum.
And, the number of particles with mass, the Higgs, is normally equal to N −NG.

Mathematical Representation of the Higgs Mechanism
The following is a detailed mathematical description of the Higgs mechanism. One
can see that the deﬁnitions of vacuum and multistability play a decisive role.

2 (Φ1 + iΦ2), and Φ1, Φ2 is a real scalar ﬁeld.
The scalar ﬁeld is transformed to
Φ →e−iα(x)Φ
(88)
The transformation of the gauge ﬁeld is
Aμ →Aμ −1
g ∂μα(x)
(89)
This is the U(1) local transformation.
(2) We have previously shown that L(1) is invariant under the U(1) local gauge
transformation. Next, we show that the Higgs ﬁeld vacuum is not zero under the
U(1) transformation, that is, SSB occurs.
Here, V (Φ) is analogous to the ferromagnetic case mentioned earlier: Higgs has
a vacuum of |⟨Φ⟩| =

−μ2
2λ ̸= 0, a vacuum broken defect, and when the angle of ⟨Φ⟩
is 0, one has ⟨Φ1⟩=

−μ2
λ
= v, ⟨Φ1⟩= 0. At this point, L(1) represents a system
whose local speciﬁcation is break the symmetric property. So, one can change the
coordinates for the new ﬁeld as follows:
Φ′
1 ≡Φ1 −v; Φ′
2 ≡Φ2
(90)
The purpose of this transformation is to make the vacuum zero, namely < Φ′
1 >=
0, < Φ′
2 >= 0.
Next, the effect of this violation of local gauge symmetry is examined.

which is a mixture of the gauge Boson and the scalar ﬁeld. In order to obtain a true
physical state, this term must be eliminated. One can do this by choosing the coor-
dinates of when—Polar coordinates—they describe tiny oscillations in the shape of
the vacuum, called parameterization.
(3) “Parameterization”.
Instead of using the real component Φ1(x), Φ2(x) to indicate Φ(x), we intro-
duce the real ﬁeld η(x) along the direction of the vacuum state vector v, and the
real ﬁeld ξ(x) along the perpendicular direction, to the vacuum state vector v, with
parameterization

At this point, the vacuum of a system described by L(2) is symmetric, but its
motion is no longer symmetric. According to the ﬁnal expression of L(2), the η
ﬁeld has real mass, mη =

−2μ2, and the gauge ﬁeld Aμ also has mass, m Aμ = gv,
but the ξ ﬁeld still has no mass. From the following derivation, it is shown to be
Goldstone boson. In the expression of L(2), there is a direct coupling between ξ and
Aμ, which we do not want to have. That is the unitary speciﬁcation to be introduced
next.

As can be seen from L(3), it has a physical meaning. It describes a spin of 1 with
a mass of gauge Boson Bμ and with a mass of m Bμ = gv, and a spin of 0 with a
mass of scalar Boson η and mη =
√
2|μ|. The Goldstone Boson ﬁeld ξ in the middle
disappears, where η is the Higgs Boson.
The above very simple example provides a complete introduction to the speciﬁc
content of the Higgs mechanism.
Now, we summarize the general properties of the Higgs mechanism:
(1) the symmetry of the interaction is conserved;
(2) the massless gauge theory satisﬁes renormalization;
(3) the total number of degrees of freedom of polarization is conserved. For exam-
ple, in the U(1) gauge transformation mentioned earlier, the total polarization degree
of freedom before SSB = 4 = (2Aμ)+(2Φ), while after SSB the total polarization
degree of freedom is = 4 = (3Bμ)+(1η);
(4) non-physical ﬁeld In the case of U(1) is ξ(x);
(5) the number of gauge Boson that acquires mass, the number of symmetry-
breaking of the possible number of GBs, and also in the case of U(1), is 1;
(6) a possible combination of GBs and the gauge Boson to acquire mass, and in
the case of U(1), this combination is the mixed term gvAμ∂μΦ′
2;
7) the Higgs mechanism itself does not predict the existence of the Higgs, which
appears only when the property of conservation of the degree of freedom of polar-
ization is required.
