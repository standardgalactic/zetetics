Abstract.
A displacement operator
ˆdζ
is introduced,
verifying commutation
relations [ ˆdζ, a†
f] = [ ˆdζ, af] = ζ(f) ˆdζ with ﬁeld creation and annihilation operators
that verify [af, ag] = 0, [af, a†
g] = (g, f), as usual.
f and g are test functions, ζ
is a Poincar´e invariant real-valued function on the test function space, and (g, f) is
a Poincar´e invariant Hermitian inner product. The ⋆-algebra generated by all these
operators, and a state deﬁned on it, nontrivially extends the ⋆-algebra of creation and
annihilation operators and its Fock space representation. If the usual requirement for
linearity is weakened, as suggested in quant-ph/0512190, we obtain a deformation of
the free quantum ﬁeld.

1. Introduction
In an earlier paper, I introduced a weakening of the axioms of quantum ﬁeld theory
that allows a nonlinear inner product structure [1]. I refer to that paper for notation,
motivation, and an introduction to the approach that is further pursued here. There, I
mentioned that I had investigated deformations of the Heisenberg algebra of the Arik-
Coons type [2], but had found no way to apply deformations of a comparable type
to quantum ﬁelds.
Here, I brieﬂy describe the failure, and move on to introduce a
displacement operator ˆdζ, verifying [ ˆdζ, a†
f] = [ ˆdζ, af] = ζ(f) ˆdζ, where ζ is an arbitrary
real-valued scalar function on the test function space (taken to be a Schwartz space [3,
§II.1]), which will allow us to construct an extension of Fock space, generated by the
action of displacement operators on a vacuum state as well as by the action of creation
operators a†
f. Note that the “displacement” is not a space-time displacement, but will
shortly be seen to “displace” creation and annihilation operators in the sense of adding
a scalar. What follows will show some of the uses to which such operators can be put.
A comparable (but Hermitian) number operator ˆnζ would verify the very diﬀerent
commutation relation [ˆnζ, a†
f] = ζ(f)a†
f. Number operators are important for a uniform
presentation of algebras of the Arik-Coons type[2], but we cannot in general construct
an associative algebra if we use the operator ˆnζ to extend the free quantum ﬁeld algebra ;
it is straightforward to verify, for example, that for the undeformed commutation
relation [af, a†
g] = (g, f), ˆnζafa†
g becomes either (a†
gaf + (g, f))(ˆnζ −ζ(f) + ζ(g)) or
a†
gaf(ˆnζ −ζ(f) + ζ(g)) + (g, f)ˆnζ, depending on the order in which the commutation
relations are applied, which is incompatible with associativity unless ζ is a constant
function on the test function space. We will here take the constant function number
operator to be relatively uninteresting, particularly because we cannot generate an
associative algebra using both a number operator ˆn1 (with the constant function 1) and
a displacement operator ˆdζ ; ˆdζˆn1a†
f, for example, becomes diﬀerent values depending
on the order in which commutation relations are applied.
Equally, every attempt I
have made at deforming the commutation relations [af, a†
g] = (g, f) and [af, ag] = 0
using number operators or displacement operators have failed to be associative, with
af(aha†
g) ̸= ah(afa†
g).
We will work with a ⋆-algebra A1 that is generated by creation and annihilation
operators that verify [af, a†
g] = (g, f) and [af, ag] = 0, together with a single
displacement operator pair ˆdζ and ˆd†
ζ.
We will take ˆd†
ζ to be equivalent to ˆd−ζ; ˆdk
ζ
to be equivalent to ˆdkζ; and ˆd0ζ to be equivalent to 1. The commutation relations above
and the state we will deﬁne in a moment are consistent with these equivalences. ˆd0ζ is
central in A1, for example. In general, we will take ˆdmζ ˆdnζ to be equivalent to ˆd(m+n)ζ.
A1 has the familiar subalgebra A0 that is generated by the creation and annihilation
operators alone. A basis for A1 is a†
g1a†
g2...a†
gm ˆdkζaf1af2...afn, k ∈ZZ, for some set of test
functions {fi}. We construct a linear state ϕ0 on this basis as
ϕ0(1) = 1,
(1)
ϕ0(a†
g1a†
g2...a†
gm ˆdkζaf1af2...afn) = 0
if m > 0 or n > 0 or k ̸= 0.
(2)

If k is always zero, this is exactly the vacuum state for the conventional free quantum
ﬁeld. To establish that ϕ0 is a state on A1, we have to show that ϕ0( ˆA† ˆA) ≥0 for
every element of the algebra.
A general element of the algebra can be written as
ˆA = P
k
P
r λkr ˆX†
kr ˆdkζ ˆYkr, where ˆXkr and ˆYkr are products of annihilation operators,
so that
ϕ0( ˆA† ˆA) = ϕ0((

X′†
kr ˆYkr))
=
X
k
ϕ0( ˆA†
k ˆAk) ≥0,
(3)
because only terms for which j = k contribute, and ˆAk = P
r λkr ˆ
X′†
kr ˆYkr is an operator
in the free quantum ﬁeld algebra A0 for each k.
The critical observation is that
ˆX′
kr = ˆd−kζ ˆXkr ˆdkζ is a sum of products of annihilation operators only.
Given the state ϕ0, we can use the GNS construction to construct a Hilbert space
H0 (see, for example, [3, §III.2]), then we can use the C⋆-algebra of bounded operators
B(H0) that act on H0 as an algebra of observables, but this or a similar construction
is not strictly needed for Physics. From the point of view established in [1], we can
be content to use a ﬁnite number of creation operators and annihilation operators
to generate a ⋆-algebra of operators.
This is not enough to support a continuous
representation of the Poincar´e group, but the formalism is Poincar´e invariant, adequate
(if we take enough generators) to construct complex enough models to be as empirically
adequate as a continuum limit, and is much simpler, more constructive, and more
appropriate for general use than Type III1 von Neumann algebras. This paper broadly
follows the general practice in physics of fairly freely employing unbounded creation and
annihilation operators. Completion of a ⋆-algebra in a norm to give at least a Banach
⋆-algebra structure, which would allow us to construct an action on the GNS Hilbert
space directly, is a useful nicety for mathematics, but it is not essential for constructing
physical models.
For future reference, I list some of the simplest identities that are entailed by the
commutation relation of the displacement operator with the creation and annihilation
operators (using a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ(BCH) formula for the exponentials):
[ ˆdk
ζ, a†
f] = [ ˆdk
ζ, af] = kζ(f) ˆdk

(7)
From these it should begin to be clear why I have called ˆdζ a “displacement” operator.
Equations (5) and (6) make apparent the useful practical consequence that it is suﬃcient
to sum the powers of displacement operators in a term to be sure whether the term
contributes to ϕ0( ˆA) — if the sum of powers is zero — because displacement operators
are not modiﬁed if they are moved to left or right in the term.

We can introduce as many displacement operators as needed, all mutually
commuting, [ ˆdζ1, ˆdζ2] = 0, without changing any essentials of the above, but probably
not as far as a continuum of such operators without signiﬁcant extra care. It is most
straightforward to introduce linear dependency between products of the displacement
operators immediately, ˆdζ1 ˆdζ2 =
ˆdζ1+ζ2, which is consistent with the commutation
relations, although we could also proceed by considering equivalence relations later in
the development. The only other comment that seems necessary is that the action of
the state ϕ0 on a basis constructed as above is zero unless there are no displacement
operators present, so that
ϕ0(1) = 1,
ϕ0(a†
g1a†
g2...a†

ζ2... ˆdkl

if m > 0 or n > 0 or any ki ̸= 0.
(8)
ˆdk1
ζ1 ˆdk2
ζ2... ˆdkl
ζl should be taken to be equal to ˆdk1ζ1+k2ζ2+···+klζl.
The basic algebra is adequately deﬁned above, the rest of this paper develops some
of the consequences for modelling correlations. Three ways in which the displacement
operators can be used are described below.
In particular, probability densities are
calculated for various models, as far as possible. All three ways can be combined freely
with the two ways of constructing nonlinear quantum ﬁelds that are described in [1],
so the comment made there must be emphasized, that the approach discussed here
should at this point be considered essentially empirical, because there is an embarrassing
number of models.
The reason for pursuing this approach nonetheless — from a
high theoretical point of view the lack of constraints on models might be seen as a
serious failing — is that it brings much better mathematical control to discussions of
renormalization, and might lead to new and hopefully useful conceptualizations and
phenomenological models of physical processes. Even if the nonlinear quantum ﬁeld
theoretic models discussed here and in [1] do not turn out to be empirically useful,
they nonetheless give an approach that can be compared in detail with standard
renormalization approaches, and an understanding of precisely why these nonlinear
models and others like them cannot be made to work should give some insight into
both approaches.
2. Displaced vacuum states
The way to use displacement operators that is discussed in this section in eﬀect
constructs representations of the subalgebra A0, because the commutation relation
[ˆφf, ˆφg] = (g, f) −(f, g) is unchanged. However, we will be able to construct vacuum
states in which the 1-measurement probability density in the Poincar´e invariant vacuum
state can be any probability density in convolution with the conventional Gaussian
probability density, which seems useful regardless, particularly if used in conjunction
with the methods of [1]. The vacuum probability density may depend on any set of
nonlinear Poincar´e invariants of the test function that describes a 1-measurement.
Let ˆφf = af + a†
f be the quantum ﬁeld, for which the conventional vacuum state
generates a characteristic function χ0(λ|f) of the 1-measurement probability density;

using a BCH formula, we obtain
χ0(λ|f) = ϕ0(eiλˆφf) = e−1
2 λ2(f,f)ϕ0(eiλa†
f eiλaf )
(9)
= e−1
2λ2(f,f),
(10)
so that the probability density associated with single measurements in the vacuum state
is the Gaussian ρ0(x|f) := exp (−x2/2(f, f))/
q
2π(f, f).
Consider ﬁrst the elementary alternative vacuum state, ϕd( ˆA) = ϕ0( ˆdζ ˆA ˆd†
ζ). For a
vacuum state, ζ should be Poincar´e invariant; this is a physical requirement on vacuum
states to which the mathematics here is largely indiﬀerent. Using this modiﬁed vacuum
state, we can generate a characteristic function for single measurements,
χd(λ|f) = ϕ0( ˆdζeiλˆφf ˆd†
ζ) = e−1
2 λ2(f,f)ϕ0( ˆdζeiλa†
f eiλaf ˆd†
ζ)
(11)
= e−1
2λ2(f,f)+2iλζ(f),
(12)
so that the probability density associated with single measurements in the modiﬁed
vacuum state is still Gaussian, but “displaced”,
ρd(x|f) :=
1
q
2π(f, f)
exp
 
−(x −2ζ(f))2
2(f, f)
!
.
(13)
As ζ(f) varies with some Poincar´e invariant scale of f, the expected displacement of the
Gaussian varies accordingly. ζ(f) might be large for “small” f, small at intermediate
scale, and large again for “large” f; any function of multiple Poincar´e invariant scales
of the test functions may be used.
Introducing a linear combination ˆΞ =

N of higher powers of ˆdζ, with
normalization constant N = P

ϕc( ˆA) = ϕ0(ˆΞ ˆAˆΞ†), which generates a characteristic function
χc(λ|f) = ϕ0(ˆΞeiλˆφf Ξ†) = e−1

If we are prepared to introduce a continuum of displacement operators, this probability
density can be any probability density in convolution with the conventional Gaussian
probability density.
A ﬁnite number of displacement operators will generally be as
empirically adequate as a continuum of displacement operators.
Finally, we can explicitly generate the n-measurement probability density in the
state ϕC( ˆA) = ϕ0(ˆΞ′ ˆA ˆΞ′†), where ˆΞ′ =

scales of the individual measurements. Note, however, that in the approach of this paper
only the gram matrix F describes the relationships between the measurements described
by the test functions fi, and all such relationships are pairwise.
3. Displacements of the ﬁeld observable-I
This and the following section introduce deformations of the ﬁeld instead of deformations
of the ground state. As above, the quantum ﬁeld discussed in this section still satisﬁes
the commutation relation [ˆφf, ˆφg] = (g, f) −(f, g), so the states we can construct again
eﬀectively generate many representations of the free ﬁeld algebra of observables (the
next section modiﬁes the commutation relations satisﬁed by the observable ﬁeld). If we
think of ourselves as constructing empirically eﬀective models for physical situations, it
is worth considering diﬀerent models for the diﬀerent intuitions they present, while of
course also presenting, as clearly as possible, isomorphisms between models, or – less
restrictively – empirical equivalences between models.
The simplest deformation discussed in this section is
ˆφf = i(af −a†
f) + α(f) ˆdζ + α∗(f) ˆd†
ζ,
(20)
This deformed ﬁeld satisﬁes microcausality because ˆdζ commutes with i(af −a†
f)‡. Note
that in this section and in the next we take af +a†
f not to be an observable of the theory,
because [(af + a†
f), i(ag −a†
g)] ̸= 0 when f and g have space-like separated supports.
We can straightforwardly calculate the vacuum state 1-measurement characteristic
function for ˆφf,
χJ(λ|f) = ϕ0(eiλˆφf) = e−1
2λ2(f,f)ϕ0(eλa†

(22)
where the Bessel function emerges because the only contributions to the result are those
for which ˆdζ and ˆd†
ζ cancel, which gives the contribution (2j)!
j!2 . This results in a probability
‡ Another possibility, ˆφ′
f = af + a†
f + ζ(f)(α ˆdζ + α∗ˆd†

This establishes a close enough relationship to the previous section that a longer presentation of this
case will not be given here.

|2α(f)|2−x2 (when |x| < |2α(f)|, otherwise 0). The probability density we have just
calculated is independent of ζ, because ˆdζ commutes with i(af −a†

up in expressions for non-vacuum state probability densities. The scales of (f, f) and
|α(f)| determine the “shape” of the convolution. The convolution is displayed in ﬁgure

have just discussed, because (dζ +d†
ζ)2 = (d2ζ +d†
2ζ)+2. The combinatorics for arbitrary
Hermitian functions of ˆdζ and ˆd†
ζ added to i(af −a†
f), potentially using multiple Poincar´e
invariant displacement functions ζi, can be as complicated as we care to consider.
Further possibilities that must be considered, because ˆdζ cannot generally be taken
to be linear in ζ, are ﬁelds such as i(af−a†
f)+α(f)( ˆdβ(f)ζ+ ˆd†
β(f)ζ), which are distinct from
the other ﬁelds considered in this section even though the vacuum state 1-measurement
probability densities are independent of β(f)ζ. If we add two displacement function
components, as in i(af −a†
f) + α1(f)( ˆdβ1(f)ζ + ˆd†
β1(f)ζ) + α2(f)( ˆdβ2(f)ζ + ˆd†
β2(f)ζ) there is
a complex modulation of the vacuum state 1-measurement probability density as the
proportion of β1(f) to β2(f) changes.
4. Displacements of the ﬁeld observable-II
The ﬁrst deformation of ˆφf that we will discuss in this section is
ˆφf = i(af −a†
f)( ˆdζ + ˆd†
ζ).
(23)
As in the previous section, this is Hermitian and satisﬁes microcausality, but the algebra
of observables generated by the observable ﬁeld is ﬁnally diﬀerent,
[ˆφf, ˆφg] = [(g, f) −(f, g)]( ˆdζ + ˆd†
ζ)2,
(24)
even though the algebra satisﬁed by the creation and annihilation operators is
unchanged. The change in the algebra of observables gives some cause to think that
physics associated with this type of construction may be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. ( ˆdζ+ ˆd†

is a central element in the algebra generated by ˆφf.

of ζ; it is inﬁnite at zero, but it is also integrable enough over the real line for all ﬁnite
moments to exist, which of course we computed explicitly in order to compute χP(λ|f).
The probability density ρP(x|f) is signiﬁcantly concentrated both near zero and
near ±∞, relative to the conventional Gaussian probability density.
If we compare
with a Gaussian that has the same variance, there is a 10 times greater probability of
observing a value beyond about 3.66 standard deviations, a 100 times greater probability
of observing a value beyond about 4.84 standard deviations, and a 1000 times greater
probability of observing a value beyond about 5.76 standard deviations.
I suppose
ρP(x|f) will give a fairly distinctive signature in physics, which future papers will
hopefully be able to make evident, and it should be clear fairly quickly whether it
can be used to model events in nature.

Although these mathematical derivations of probability densities can be derived,
and give a distinct insight, the moments, which are essentially what are physically
measurable, can be determined more easily from the characteristic functions, or directly
from the action of a state on an observable.

This has variance 6(f, f); it is plotted for (f, f) = 1 in Figure 2. In general we can

It will be
interesting to discover what range of probability densities this will allow us to construct.
5. Discussion
This mathematics is essentially quite clear and simple, but it is also rather rich and
nontrivial, and there are lots of concrete models. It will be apparent that I do not have

proper control of the full range of possibilities. From philosophical points of view that
seek a uniquely preferred model and that ﬁnd the tight constraints of renormalization
on acceptable physical models congenial, it will be seen as problematic that there is
a plethora of models, but a loosening of constraints accords well with our experience
of wide diversity in the natural world, and is no more than a return to the almost
unconstrained diversity of classical particle and ﬁeld models.
It is so far rather unclear how to understand the mathematics as physics, but
any interpretation will follow a common (but not universal) quantum ﬁeld theoretical
assumption that we measure probabilities and correlation functions of scalar observables
that are indexed by test functions. There are existing ways of discussing condensed
matter physics that are fairly amenable to this style of interpretation, but it is likely
that we will have to abandon some of our existing ways of talking about particles to
accommodate this mathematics.
It is also reiterated here, following [1], that the positive spectrum condition on
the energy, which has been so much part of the quantum ﬁeld theoretical landscape,
should be deprecated, because energy (and as well energy density) is unobservable,
inﬁnite, and nonlocal. If we think of the random ﬁeld that is the classical equivalent of
a given quantum ﬁeld, taking [af, a†
g] = (g, f)+(f, g) so that the commutator is real and
[ˆφf, ˆφg] = 0 for all test functions, it is clear that we are discussing an essentially fractal
structure, for which diﬀerentiation and energy density at a point are undeﬁned. From a
proper mathematical perspective, we should consider only ﬁnite local observables. We
have accepted renormalization formalisms that manage inﬁnities only in lack of a ﬁnite
alternative, a basis for which this paper and its precursor provide.
The method of section 4 is perhaps more signiﬁcant mathematically than the
methods of sections 2 and 3, insofar as the quantum ﬁeld observables of section 4
satisfy modiﬁed commutation relations, in common with the methods for constructing
nonlinear quantum ﬁelds that are presented in [1]. However, quantum theory somewhat
exaggerates the importance of commutation relations between quantum mechanically
ideal measurement devices — the trivial commutation relations of classically ideal
measurement devices can give a description of experiments that is equally empirically
adequate[5, 6], and ideal measurement devices between the quantum and the classical
can also be used as points of reference[7].
Physics emphasizes a commitment to observed statistics, which present essentially
uncontroversial lists of numbers, but it is far more diﬃcult to describe what we believe
we have measured than the statistics and the lists of numbers themselves. It might be
said, for example, that “we have measured the momentum of a particle”, and cite a
list of times and places where devices triggered, ignoring the delicate questions of (1)
whether there is any such thing as “a particle”, (2) whether a particle can be said to
have any well-deﬁned properties at all, and (3) whether particles have “momentum” in
particular. It makes sense to describe a measurement in such a way, because it forms
a signiﬁcant part of a coordinatization of the measurement that is good enough for the
experiment and its results to be reproduced, but an alternative conceptualization can
