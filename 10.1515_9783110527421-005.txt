5 Putting It All Together
Having presented extensive evidence in support of secular evolution from the ana-
lytical, numerical, and observational aspects, we now put together what we have
learned so far to examine the foundations and implications of the new secular evolu-
tion paradigm in more depth. Part of the content in this chapter, especially Section 5.1,
has previously appeared in Zhang (2016).‚Ä†
5.1 Reexamine the Foundations
In this section, we address a few issues that had been at the foundations of the density
wave theory since its inception, and had also been the greatest source of controversy
and debate. The lessons we learned in trying to understand the role of collective effects
in, and self-consistent evolution of, disk galaxies possessing density wave modes can
Ô¨Ånally put to rest some of these controversies.
5.1.1 On the Modal and Quasi-Steady State Hypotheses of Density
Waves in Physical and Simulated Disk Galaxies
The mass Ô¨Çow rate equation we have obtained in this work is exact when the density
wave pattern involved is a spontaneously formed mode that has achieved quasi-steady
state (QSS). When this state is achieved, the rate of global wave ampliÔ¨Åcation through
over-reÔ¨Çection at corotation and feedback near the galactic central region is balanced
by local dissipation at the density-wave collisionless shock. The wave amplitude as
well as its shape is unchanged (at least on the timescale of a local dynamical time, or
the galaxy rotation period), and the only measurable secular change is the slow redis-
tribution of disk matter both inside and outside corotation, as well as the heating of
disk stars and the energy injection into interstellar medium (ISM). In this subsection,
we examine the validity of the modal and QSS hypotheses.
5.1.1.1 Previous Work
The quasi-stationary spiral structure (QSSS) hypothesis had been used in the past few
decades by many workers to explain the grand design spiral structures in galaxies
‚Ä† In fact, most of the contents of Zhang (2016) paper were Ô¨Årst written for an earlier draft of the current
book. During its initial review handled by a different publisher, a referee objected to the fact that much
of these new contents had not yet appeared in peer-reviewed journals. As a result, the author halted
the revision of the book, and revised and reorganized a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of the new contents into
article forms, which were then published in peer-reviewed journals prior to the book being accepted
by De Gruyter for publication.

(Bertin et al. 1989a, 1989b and the references therein), though in these previous ana-
lyses the mechanisms for wave damping and for secular evolution of the basic state
were not properly identiÔ¨Åed.
How good are the modal and QSSS hypotheses? Are there any objective ways we
can judge these? Earlier workers (e. g., Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1983, 1989) employed
statistical arguments to support the QSSS hypothesis, and N-body simulations
provided support to the modal and QSSS hypotheses to varying degrees (Donner &
Thomasson 1994; Zhang 1998, 2016).
Zhang & Buta (2007, 2015), Buta & Zhang (2009) used near- and mid-infrared
images of galaxies to show that for nearby grand design galaxies, the level of QSS for
the density wave patterns involved can be judged from the coherence of the potential-
density phase shift (PDPS) curves, and from the level of agreement between the
phase-shift positive-to-negative zero-crossing predictions for the corotation resonance
(CR) radii and the actual resonance features in galaxies. Independent studies have
conÔ¨Årmed the accuracy of the PDPS method for determining the CRs in grand design
galaxies (i. e., Haan et al. 2009, who compared several methods for CR determination
previously published in the literature, and stated ‚ÄúFor our galaxies the phase-shift
method appears to be the most precise method with uncertainties of (5‚Äì10)% ...‚Äù;
as well as Mart√≠nez-Garc√≠a et al. 2009, 2011 who used a color gradient method to
determine the CRs, and among their sample galaxies which overlapped with that of
Zhang & Buta 2007 or Buta & Zhang 2009, there is good agreement in the CR locations
determined by these two independent approaches).
As we have commented earlier in this text, the very validity of the PDPS approach
requires that the density wave patterns involved in these grand design spiral and
barred galaxies are global modes rather than transient waves. In the PDPS approach,
we used only the surface density maps, obtained from the observed surface brightness
maps, to derive a partially kinematic property such as the corotation radius. Without
the pattern being a quasi-steady mode that has achieved global self-consistency, we
would not expect such correspondence between surface density kinematics.
5.1.1.2 Analogy with Fully Developed Turbulence
In what follows, we demonstrate another effective approach for judging the QSS of
the modes‚Ä†, in addition to the previous approach of Zhang & Buta (2007) and Buta &
Zhang (2009), of comparing the phase shift curve positive-to-negative zero crossings
with the resonant features on galaxy images. This time, instead of using the radial
distribution of the PDPS, we will actually make use of the mass-Ô¨Çow-rate curve, even
though the two curves have the same zero crossings, because as it turns out the mag-
nitude of the mass Ô¨Çow rate curve provides crucial information about the quasi-steady
modal status as well.
‚Ä† We use QSS in the following instead of the original QSSS (meaning quasi-stationary spiral structure)
abbreviation because we are considering the quasi-steady state of both the spiral and bar modes.

5 Putting It All Together
In Figure 5.1, we present the comparison of radial mass Ô¨Çow rates of six galax-
ies (previously analyzed in Chapter 4) calculated using the torque equation (2.124),
Ô¨Årst using only the m = 2 Fourier components (dashed curves) for the perturbation
density and potential, and subsequently using the full set of Fourier components
(solid curves). We see immediately that apart from minor differences, the agreement
between the m = 2 (two-armed Fourier components) calculation and m = full
(short-hand for using all Fourier components) calculation agree to a high degree. In
particular, slightly larger disagreements were obtained for the two galaxies (NGC 5194,
or M51; and NGC 3627) that are known to be undergoing tidal interactions. We also
notice that along the trend of Hubble-type evolution from late to early (left to right,
top to bottom for these six galaxies in Figure 5.1), the agreement between the m = 2
and m = full mass Ô¨Çow rates gets progressively better.
In Figure 5.2, we present similar comparison of m = 2 and m = full mass Ô¨Çow rates
for galaxy NGC 1530. This galaxy has exceptionally high mass Ô¨Çow rate even though it
is in a relatively isolated environment. We observe that the m = full mass Ô¨Çow rate was
signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the m = 2 mass Ô¨Çow rate (though the zero crossings of the two
curves are similar), indicating that the amplitude of the mode is yet to settle into its
quasi-steady value even though the modal density proÔ¨Åle appears to be stabilized: the
amplitude of the mode is obviously on the wane.
Previously in Chapter 2, we have demonstrated that the growth rate of the mode
ùõæg due to global ampliÔ¨Åcation and feedback cycle is positively correlated with the frac-
tion of m = 2 sinusoidal modal component in the density wave composition (since
only the m = 2 modal component has the correct phase relationship after each round
trip of wave propagation to form growing mode; whereas the higher harmonic com-
ponents cancel out due to their lack of correct phase relations). On the other hand,
the effective dissipation rate ùõæd of the mode, once the wave has acquired sufÔ¨Åcient
nonlinear amplitude, is approximately independent of the exact nonlinear distortions
of the wave proÔ¨Åle (since ùõæd is determined mainly by the PDPS pattern for a wave
with a given amplitude, and the phase shift was previously shown, in Figure 2.5, to be
relatively independent of the degree of nonlinearity in the azimuthal density proÔ¨Åle
of the mode). Therefore, for high-amplitude, very nonlinear density wave mode such
as present in NGC 1530, the mode is able to manipulate the degree of nonlinearity
(i. e., non-sinusoidal-ness) of its azimuthal proÔ¨Åle to boost up the ratio of the damp-
ing rate versus the growth rate, in order to evolve toward a quasi-steady equilibrium
amplitude.
The results shown above, that at QSS of the wave mode the m = 2 and m = full
contribution to radial mass Ô¨Çow are approximately equal, might appear at Ô¨Årst sight
to be surprising, that is, how could something that is supposed to be only ‚Äúa part‚Äù
of the whole be equal to the whole? Here we need to realize the specialness of a self-
organized density wave mode that has achieved QSS. The mode had gone through long
period of Ô¨Åne adjustments among its various physical processes so that the global
self-consistency condition is achieved. Among these processes, one of them is the
randomization of the orbital energy of the basic state matter during the energy and

angular momentum exchange between the wave mode and the basic state, through
the mediation of the collisionless shock at spiral arms. This randomization process
happens both for the stellar and for the ISM components of the galaxy disk mass, and
there are in fact two aspect to it: one aspect is the randomization of the orbital energy
corresponding to Kp √óLwave, where Kp is the pattern speed of the wave and Lwave is the
angular momentum density of the wave, this contributes to the damping of the wave
and the secular decay of the mean stellar orbit; the second aspect is the randomiza-
tion of the residual orbital energy corresponding to (K ‚Äì Kp) √ó Lwave (for matter inside
corotation. There is a corresponding sign change for matter outside corotation). This
second aspect results in the secular heating of the disk stars (which produces the age‚Äì
velocity dispersion relation of the solar neighborhood stars Zhang 1999), as well as the
energy injection into the ISM to fuel a cascade process akin to the driven turbulence
in Ô¨Çuid dynamics (which produces the Larson‚ÄìLaw size‚Äìline-width correlation of the
interstellar clouds. See Larson 1981; Zhang et al. 2001; Zhang 2002; Falceta-Gon√ßalves
et al. 2015; as well as our earlier discussions in Section 4.5).
Stars appear to accomplish the randomization of the orbital energy also through
a kind of cascade/randomization process from the large down to the progressively
smaller scales. The smaller-scale nonlinear exchange is nothing more than the cas-
caded down version of the large-scale exchange and does not create a new term in the
energy balance equation. Another way to look at this matter is that at the QSS, the
growth rate of the m = 2 mode is equal to the growth rate of the full nonlinear mode
since the nonlinear mode does not have an independent global ampliÔ¨Åcation mech-
anism other than the cascading of energy from the m = 2 component. Therefore, at the
QSS the m = 2 mode dissipation rate (which is proportional to the m = 2 torque integ-
ral) is formally equal to the m = 2 growth rate‚Ä†, with the m
Ã∏= 2 components formally
‚Ä† We say formally here because the torque integral acquires its meaning as corresponding to the dis-
sipative angular momentum exchange between the wave and basic state matter only for the overall full
nonlinear set of components at the QSS. For each m component individually or for waves not at the QSS
the torque integral does not uniquely predict anything, since it is a spatial average of time-dependent

have zero growth rate as well as zero dissipation rate, even through in reality the m = 2
mode cannot accomplish energy dissipation without going through the cascade into
nonlinear components.
This aspect of local interactions in density waves is in essence the same as what
Kolmogorov had hypothesized for the energy cascade process of fully developed Ô¨Çuid
turbulence in the inertial range (Frisch 1995). The fact that galaxies can randomize the
originally coherent orbital velocity/energy is due to the global-self-consistency con-
straint of the spontaneously-formed density wave mode at the QSS, which produced
both the local instability/collisionless shock condition at the spiral arms, as well as
the detailed correlation between kinematic and positional distributions of disk matter
that enable both wave growth and damping, accompanied by dissipative basic state
evolution.
In what follows we present similar m = 2 versus m = full mass Ô¨Çow rate com-
parison calculated using the surface density and potential obtained in the set-of-four
N-body simulations we presented in Chapter 3. In Figures 5.3‚Äì5.6, we show the respect-
ively calculated m = 2 and m = full mass Ô¨Çow rates for the four runs, at six different
time steps, and for a duration of 4,000 steps which correspond to about three and a
half galactic rotation periods at radius 20, during the emergence and stabilization of
the Ô¨Årst dominant mode in each case.
From these four Ô¨Ågures, we see that in simulations as in physical galaxies we can
use the agreement between the m = 2 and m = full mass Ô¨Çow rates to judge the QSS of
the wave mode. Note that the QSS can be short-lived even after its initial acquirement
because the disk surface density and modal shape continue to evolve throughout the
simulation run for each softening case. Still, exploration into further time period of the
modal evolution shows that a new QSS phase can once again be achieved (signiÔ¨Åed
by good agreement between m = 2 and m = full mass Ô¨Çow curves) after its temporary
loss as a result of the basic state evolution.
Note that for the asoft = 0.1 run in the last two frames there is the signature of
a local instability clump, which produced poor agreement between the m = 2 and
m = full torque curves in the outer disk region, as is expected of such a transient
nonmodal feature.
5.1.1.3 A Close-Up Look at the Modal Characteristics Evolution
In Figures 5.7‚Äì5.12 we present the morphological and power spectra evolution for the
N-body spiral/bar mode using asoft = 0.25, here with better spatial-temporal resol-
ution in the plotting than we had presented in Chapter 3, and covering the entire
duration of the simulation run.
variables. In other words, the torque integral, when used to predict the wave/basic state angular
momentum exchange, is a form of closure relation enforced through the consideration of global energy
balance, at the QSS of the wave mode.

Figure 5.7: Morphological evolution of an N-body spiral/bar mode. The rotation period at r = 20 is
about 1,256 steps. The softening parameter is asoft = 0.25 (adapted from Zhang 2016).
We see from these Ô¨Ågures that even though the spiral pattern involved is not per-
fectly steady, it is a mode (or a modal set, since during some time intervals there exist
nested modes of different pattern speeds, which are present in physical galaxies as
well) nonetheless, rather than a combination of transient wave trains (these wave
trains would have Ô¨Ålled up the spectral space with disorganized noisy components,
rather than coherent and concentrated spectral clumps). During certain intervals, the
mode transitions to a different shape in response to the changing basic state, and the
power spectra may reveal additional features. But after a while the dominant mode
(or sometimes the modal set) always settles back onto its quasi-stable location on the
power-spectra plot. This is the kind of ‚Äúattractor‚Äù or ‚Äúasymptotic stability‚Äù behavior
we would expect of a mode.
In Figures 5.13 and 5.14, we plot the m = 2 density and potential contours, covering
also the duration of the simulation but with courser time spacing. We see that until the
very end of the simulation, which is roughly 25 rotation periods at reference radius of
20, the underlying m = 2 mode is still alive and well, even though the heating of the
basic state of the disk by the modal instability has submerged the nonlinear spiral
pattern (the heating is a result of using smaller number of particles than in physical
galaxies; of the near-collision condition at the modal collisionless shock; and of using
a small softening length choice).

Figure 5.8: Power spectra of the above mode. Each frame is calculated with a central time step
identical to that in the corresponding morphology frame and with a time step range of 1,600 (adapted
from Zhang 2016).
In Figure 5.15, we plot the evolution of the radial mass Ô¨Çow rates due to the spiral
mode, using once again the full density and potential perturbations (solid lines), as
well as only the m = 2 density and potential perturbation components (dashed lines).
A comparison between this last group of Ô¨Ågures and that of the power spectra
evolution Ô¨Ågures (Figures 5.8, 5.10, and 5.12) show several interesting features:
(i)
As the evolution advances, the matter as well as the spiral activity become
concentrated into the central region of the galaxy.
(ii)
A better m = 2/m = full agreement (especially for the inner disk, inside or
around corotation radius of 20) is associated with a more concentrated power-
spectrum peak location, indicating that the former is a good criterion for judging
the QSS of the mode, as we have argued previously in Section 5.1.1.2.
(iii)
The amplitude of the radial mass Ô¨Çow rate curves decreases with time (note
the reduced maximum positive vertical scale with advancing time, among the
three double-row-sets of Ô¨Ågures, i. e., 10‚Äì5 for the Ô¨Årst two rows, 2 √ó 10‚Äì6 for the
second two rows, and 5 √ó 10‚Äì7 for the third two rows, respectively). Associated

with this decreasing radial mass Ô¨Çow rate toward the end of the simulation, the
agreement between the m = 2 and m = full mass Ô¨Çow rates are better, especially
for the central region where the mass and modal activity are concentrated. This
shows that the slower secular evolution speed toward the end of the simula-
tion (due to the reduction of nonlinear spiral amplitude) leads to slower modal
evolution, and thus a better QSS or global self-consistency.
We conclude that the variation of the spiral pattern (both its morphology and pattern
speed) is to a large extent a result of the secular evolution of the basic state induced
by the very same density wave mode. We here recall the saying that ‚Äúone cannot have
the cake and eat it too.‚Äù If we seek to obtain QSS of the mode, we cannot have fast
secular evolution of the basic state at the same time. If the secular evolution is fast, the
modal characteristics evolve rapidly with it, so as to be compatible with the evolving
boundary condition. During these transitional times, the power spectra may indicate
additional peaks other than that corresponding to the dominant modes, or possess
slopes. This does not mean that the mode (or modal set) has become a transient wave.
The mode is still a mode, only it is changing and evolving, just like when a person
ages, he or she is still the same person (although some people would refer this process
as the old self dying and a new self being born ‚Äì which is OK as long as we all know
what we are talking about).

identical to that in the corresponding morphology frame and with a time step range of 1,600 (adapted
from Zhang 2016).
Therefore we should relax our condition for calling a mode quasi-steady: As long as
it satisÔ¨Åes the global self-consistency condition (growth rate = damping rate), we can
regard it as quasi-steady even if it constantly evolves to accommodate the changing
basic state boundary condition as a result of the secular evolution of the basic state
induced by the very same mode. For the theoretical results (that of the torque integral
and mass Ô¨Çow rate equations) to hold, the mode only needs to be quasi-steady on the
local dynamical timescale (in this simulation the local dynamical time at radius 20 is
1,296 time steps, slightly shorter than the time duration between adjacent frames in
Figures 5.7‚Äì5.12).
We would also like to point out once again that the observed galaxies, especially
the nearby, grand design, noninteracting, intermediate to early type galaxies, appear
to have even better agreement between the m = 2 and m = full estimations of torque,
than what we have been able to reproduce in the current generation of N-body simu-
lations. The agreement between m = 2 and m = full torques appears to span several
sets of nested modes, as in the case of NGC 4321 (M100), NGC 4736, and NGC 3351. This
agreement between the m = 2 and m = full torques indicates a high degree of global

self-consistency for the modes in observed grand design galaxies, a result obviously
partly due to a Hubble-time‚Äôs worth of self-consistent evolution, including the active
participation also of the bulge and halo components (which are held Ô¨Åxed in our N-
body simulations), partly due to the much higher (by several orders of magnitude)
numbers of degrees of freedom that physical galaxies have, compared to that avail-
able in simulated galaxies, to be used for adjusting the multitude of correlations to
achieve a Ô¨Åne balance between modal growth and dissipation, between the secular
evolution of the basic state and the transformation of density wave morphology to be
compatible with the renewed basic state.
5.1.2 Role of Basic State SpeciÔ¨Åcation
As we have commented before, the correct choice of basic state in secular evolution
studies involves the use of galaxy disk parameters that allows the global density wave
modes to spontaneously emerge and be stabilized. Why is it so important to choose
a basic state speciÔ¨Åcation that allows unstable modes? Couldn‚Äôt the transient waves
on overstable basic state also accomplish the objective of secular evolution, as seems

to be advocated in a recent review article of Sellwood (2014), which is titled ‚ÄúSec-
ular Evolution in Galaxies‚Äù? We have commented on this issue already in previous
chapters, here we offer some further explanations.
First of all, we point out that in none of the transient wave simulations, carried
out by Sellwood and his collaborators over the past three decades, as well as by more
recent researchers such as Baba, Saitoh, & Wada (2013); D‚ÄôOnghia, Vogelsberger, &
Hernquist (2013); D‚ÄôOnghia (2015), etc., was there a systematic trend of mass inÔ¨Çow
inside corotation, and outÔ¨Çow outside, such as what we have demonstrated in the
current work. The fundamental reason for this is that the transient waves rely on res-
onant interactions between the stars making up the wave trains and the basic state
to exchange angular momentum. In transient waves, the resonances are broadened,
but the interaction is not coordinated as in the modal case. For example, Carlberg
& Sellwood (1985) state that the sense of angular momentum exchange between the
wave and the basic state does not depend on the winding sense of the spiral at the
Lindblad resonances, so a leading and a trailing wave train can exchange angular

momentum with the basic state in the same way. Sellwood & Binney (2002) studied the
so-called ‚Äúradial migration‚Äù process of stars due to resonant interaction of waves and
stars near the corotation region, yet they conclude that the end result of this interac-
tion is such that the entire population of interacting stars do not lose or gain angular
momentum, so there is no systematic radial mass Ô¨Çow that leads to bulge building
through this so-called ‚Äúradial migration‚Äù process. These resonant interactions thus
are of entirely different nature than the collective interactions between the wave mode
and the basic state stars that we studied in this work. Resonant interaction is top-
down, that is, stars passively respond to an enforced smooth potential, whereas the
collective interaction is sideways, that is, individual stars develop correlations in their
motion through the mediation of collective instabilities and collisionless shocks.
For unstable global modes, however, their surface density and kinematics are
such that they support a characteristic distribution of PDPS between the potential
spiral and the density spiral of the mode. This phase shift distribution in turn leads to
a secular torque by the modal potential on the density, and as a result a secular radial
mass Ô¨Çow pattern as we had mentioned above. The global self-consistency require-
ment for these modes (since the modes are self-organized and self-sustained) is what
brought on the effective singularity condition at the spiral/bar wave crest, which leads

to coordinated secular evolution of the basic state of the galactic disk, as well as the
constant revision of the wave modal shape to accommodate the changing basic state.
For transient wave trains in an overstable disk, on the other hand, the global
self-consistency condition is not enforced, and it is not necessarily that the spiral
arms are the site of effective singularity and collective dissipation. The no-global-
self-consistency condition means no QSS, thus the transient patterns continuously
evolve (in a haphazard fashion, rather than in a coherent fashion as in the modal scen-
ario). The fact that some researchers succeeded in producing a continued sequence of
wave decay and reemergence within this scenario (Baba 2013; D‚ÄôOnghia et al. 2013)
does not mean all observed spirals are such recurrent transients, especially not those
grand design two-armed spirals which account for about 50% of disk galaxies (Pettitt,
Tasker, & Wadsley 2016), nor those galaxies that possess long-lived resonance features
such as nuclear, inner and outer rings.
If our goal is to obtain the coordinated radial mass Ô¨Çow pattern that is respons-
ible for the secular growth of bulge and galaxy morphological evolution along the
Hubble sequence, then we cannot avoid choosing an unstable basic state to global
modal formation, and employing the collective interaction of these modes with their
parent basic state of the disk, such as is done in the current work. To model galaxies

is oftentimes more than to produce a visual appearance of spirals or bars, but rather
to bring out the intrinsic common dynamics underlying the formation and evolution
of a large class of these galaxies.
To study global collective effect thoroughly is inherently more challenging than
to study local effects one at a time. However, without taking a globally self-consistent
view, we will not be able to arrive at the forced singularity condition (in some sense,
nature itself is forced into arriving at the collective dissipation process in these sin-
gularities when given conÔ¨Çicting requirements that cannot be resolved by a smooth
differentiable solution). When taking a local view, it is like the fable of the blind men
and elephant, we might mistake a tail, a trunk, a tusk, as the essence of the elephant.
And even if we take stock of all of these pieces, we still cannot pile them together to
arrive at a live elephant. Anything that is alive is the result of co-evolution between
the system and the environment. The co-evolution process is when the correlations
are gradually set up. These multitudes of correlations among the constituent parts are
what give the system its livelihood and its evolutionary dynamics.
In this context we see that the so-called action-angle approach adopted by
many previous practitioners of galactic dynamics (Binney & Tremaine 2008 and the
references therein; Sellwood 2014 and the references therein), which follows a vener-
able tradition in classical mechanics and classical kinetic theory, exactly ignored this
correlation among the constituent particles. It produces a system that is harmonic by
design (that is what the angle part represents ‚Äì that is, sinusoidal oscillations; and the
action part represents conserved integrals). The validity of the action-angle approach
depends on the assumption that most of the orbits supporting the galactic potential
are made up of so-called regular orbits that respect the conserved integrals under
the smooth average potential; whereas we learned in the current work that most of
the orbits in the self-organized density wave potential are severely perturbed (by the
collisionless shock) and thus are almost always chaotic (see Figure 3.24), and these
chaotic orbits are associated with a grainy potential incorporating correlations. The
closed-up harmonic system described by the action-angle approach will not display
secular behavior (apart from orbit resonances, which is a local effect), at least not
the type involving global collective dissipation processes which produce interparticle
correlations that lead to mass inÔ¨Çow inside corotation and outÔ¨Çow outside.
These said, it is not the current author‚Äôs assertion that the action-angle approach
has no merits in studying galactic dynamical problems. There are at least three scen-
arios that this approach (or the associated phase space distribution function approach
governed by collisionless Boltzmann equation) is in fact applicable: (1) when the sys-
tem involved is in steady state and is not unstable to the growth of global modes.
(2) When the system is unstable to the emergence of modes, but its behavior is Ô¨Årst
analyzed in the linear regime. In that case we are studying the modal growth regime
with no secular evolution of the basic state. (3) In non-self-consistent studies of, say,
gas response to an applied stellar potential, then the stellar potential itself can be
regarded as smooth. One needs to be cautious about interpreting the results of this

266
5 Putting It All Together
approach when, say, the self-gravity of the gas becomes important. It such cases the
often-large phase shift between the stars and gas derived from the non-self-consistent
analysis are not physical, and disappears when the self-gravity of the gas is included
in the study (Lubow et al. 1986; Balbus 1988).
5.2 Broader Implications
In this section we discuss the implications of the current work on the self-organized
structure formation process in a broader range of physical systems, as well as on the
cosmological evolution of galaxies and structures.
5.2.1 Self-Organization in Nonequilibrium Systems
and the Formation of Singularity Hierarchy
Understanding the self-organization (or morphogenesis) behavior of nonlinear, far
from equilibrium systems is among the most challenging of problems of contemporary
research. More than half a century ago, Richard Feynman closed volume II of ‚ÄúThe
Feynman Lectures on Physics" by declaring: ‚ÄúThe next great era of awakening of
human intellect may well produce a method of understanding the qualitative content
of equations. Today we cannot. Today we cannot see that the water Ô¨Çow equations
contain such things as the barber pole structure of turbulence that one sees between
rotating cylinders. Today we cannot see whether Schrodinger‚Äôs equation contains
frogs, musical composers, or morality ‚Äì or whether it does not‚Äù (Feynman, Leighton,
& Sands 1964).
Among studies on morphogenesis, one of the most prophetic is that of Ilya
Prigogine. In his theory of ‚Äúdissipative structures,‚Äù Prigogine emphasized the
entropy-production-enhancing function of self-organized global patterns in far-from-
equilibrium systems, as well as the constructive role of dissipation in maintaining
these patterns (Prigogine 1980). To paraphrase this theory, most of the self-organized
structures in nature come in roughly two types: (1) equilibrium structures, which are
formed through equilibrium phase transitions. The examples of equilibrium structure
formation include the phase transition of water to form ice when the temperature
is lowered to 0‚àòC, as well as the formation of minerals of a speciÔ¨Åc crystal structure
when the environmental temperature and pressure satisfy a range of conditions (i. e.,
the formation of diamond crystal from carbon in a high-pressure environment); (2)
nonequilibrium structures, which are formed in systems far from equilibrium, and
which (in addition to sharing some common features with structures formed in equi-
librium phase transitions) have the added feature that these self-organized structures
are generally in a dynamical equilibrium state, meaning they are sustained through
the competition of growth and decay tendencies (as highlighted by the well-known

5.2 Broader Implications
267
Ô¨Çuctuation-dissipation theorem, proved mostly at close-to-equilibrium regimes but
is also valid at far-from-equilibrium situations for self-organized dissipative struc-
tures). There is in general also a continuous Ô¨Çux of energy and entropy through the
system to maintain the nonequilibrium Ô¨Çuctuation. The formation of self-organized
dissipative structures in nonequilibrium systems often serves the important func-
tion of greatly accelerating the speed of entropy evolution of the parent systems
(Prigogine 1980)‚Ä†.
As we have seen in this work, the hierarchy of self-organization processes in a
nonequilibrium system often leads to a series of effective singularities in the dynam-
ics, which allow emergent new dynamics to form that cannot be deductively derived
from the differential formulation one starts the analysis with. A synthetic approach
uniting the various local aspects to achieve global self-consistency will need to be
adopted.
Although the mechanism for the emergence of new dynamics through ‚Äúspontan-
eous breaking of gauge symmetry‚Äù had been routinely proposed in high energy phys-
ics, it was mostly used in a model context, rather than derived from Ô¨Årst principles.
In such applications, perturbation expansion around a symmetry-breaking potential
minimum (ground-state) of the model Lagrangian function is performed when
studying excitations from such a ground state. This perturbation expansion generates
a new effective Lagrangian with its associated new dynamics (for example, it could
give mass to electrons through the Higgs mechanism); yet no self-consistent evolution
of the global background environment (corresponding to the basic state of the galaxy
problem), which is responsible to the form of the original Lagrangian in the Ô¨Årst place,
can be studied through such local algebraic manipulations. Quoting condensed mat-
ter physicist P.W. Anderson: ‚Äú... the concept of broken symmetry has been borrowed
by the elementary particle physicists, but their use of the term is strictly an analogy,
whether a deep or a specious one remaining to be understood‚Äù (Anderson 1972).
On the other hand, the fact that, as of now, there have been very few examples
of self-organized dissipative structures in low-energy physical systems analyzed from
Ô¨Årst principles (in Prigogine‚Äôs work, chemical clock was used as one prominent
example) is partly due to the intrinsic complexities of such problems, that is, the
many degrees of freedom of the components, and the correlations among the compon-
ents, which invalidate many basic assumptions underlying the usual kinetic-theory
approach for treating many-particle systems. One of the most important assumptions
‚Ä† The transportation of entropy to its environment is the chief means a dissipative structure can
maintain a low or constant entropy state locally despite it being a very efÔ¨Åcient engine at the local
production of entropy. This aspect also resolves the paradox of how nature can generate complex bio-
logical entities such as human beings as a result of nonequilibrium evolution, despite being governed
by the second law of thermodynamics universally. The study of nonequilibrium dissipative struc-
tures tells us that entropy-increasing evolution does not always mean the rush toward homogeneity
everywhere, at least not for open, many degree-of-freedom, far-from-equilibrium systems.

used in the derivation of the Boltzmann kinetic equation is the so-called ‚Äúmolecular
chaos‚Äù assumption (see, e. g., Kreuzer 1981 for a detailed description of the BBGKY
procedure for the derivation of the collisional Boltzmann equation, which we brieÔ¨Çy
outline in the Appendix of this monograph), or the assumption that particle collisions
are uncorrelated. This assumption is crucial to Boltzmann‚Äôs arriving at his famous H-
theorem, or that thermodynamic entropy (which is of the opposite sign as Boltzmann‚Äôs
H-function) never decreases in nonequilibrium processes. The interparticle correla-
tions, however, are the necessary ingredient for obtaining self-organized behavior,
and their reintroduction into the study of nonequilibrium dynamics allows local-
entropy-decreasing processes to be admitted into the analyses.
Accompanying the emergence of global patterns, in an originally featureless sys-
tem past its instability threshold, there is also the spontaneous emergence of new
meta-laws. The torque-integral/mass-Ô¨Çow rate equation we have conÔ¨Årmed using N-
body simulations in this work is an example of emergent meta-law. The original
derivation of this law required the assumption of global self-consistency between
the various physical processes in the galaxy, which is a logical necessity; as well as
the assumption of QSS of the wave mode, which is an empirically well-supported
hypothesis.
Given these two very reasonable basic assumptions, the outcome of the secular
evolution of the basic state of the galactic disk is inevitable, given that the pat-
tern‚Äôs matter distribution and kinematics naturally lead to the characteristic PDPS
pattern which implies a secular torque action by the wave mode on the basic state,
and thus secular energy and angular momentum exchange between the two compon-
ents. The operation of this exchange process is necessarily dissipative (as there is the
irreversible conversion of stellar orbital energy into random motion energy of stars),
and this operation is accomplished through the density-wave collisionless shock.
Generalizing what we have learned in this work, we realize that in nature irrevers-
ibility may be the rule rather than the exception, even though the differential forms of
governing equations we commonly employ are all time-reversible. We now realize that
these differential laws are likely to be idealizations, and their origins may be emergent
under the general boundary conditions of the evolving universe. In this sense laws
and meta-laws (or fundamental laws and emergent laws) have no clear distinction. It
all depends on the scale we conduct our observations and analyses in.
We also realize that effective singularity hierarchies (as reÔ¨Çected, e. g., in the
spontaneous emergence of density wave modes, and the attainment of new closure
relations at the QSS) may be the general mechanism nature employs to separate
the different domains of physical and biological sciences. Within a given hierarchy,
deductive approach may be used to arrive at new inferences. However, when we are
crossing the boundary of a given hierarchy (such as in the study of the emergence
and maintenance of global spiral modes, as well as the secular evolution of the basic
state of the galactic disk as a result of its interaction with these modes), we need to
rely on empirical evidence (such as the QSS hypothesis of the mode), meta-principles

(such as the second law of thermodynamics and the theory of dissipative structures),
as well as reasonable global closure relations (such as global energy and angular
momentum balance considerations) in order to establish a new axiomatic structure
for subsequent analyses.
We now also have a tentative answer to the question Feynman raised: Sch-
rodinger‚Äôs equation most likely does not directly predict the existence of frogs, musical
composers, and morality. Since the physical universe is organized in a hierarchical
fashion with effective singularities separating the different hierarchies, and since
emergent laws governing the higher-level phenomena cannot be deductively derived
from the lower-level ‚Äúfundamental laws,‚Äù the claim that complex phenomena of
the universe can be logically derived from a simple set of fundamental equations
is unfounded. Instead, the differential forms of equations governing given regimes
of physics are expected to be idealizations that have limited range of applicability
and will break down at instability/singularity front of the next emerging hierarchy.
In such cases, guided by empirical evidence and physical intuition, new global-
self-consistency conditions and new meta laws (formulated perhaps as a new set of
differential equations with their new range of applicability) need to be obtained to
guide the analyses.
The universe since the Big Bang is in a process of irreversible evolution. If we
take into account the subtleties of quantum mechanics, no process is truly revers-
ible (i. e., no physical system can become truly isolated). Yet we have learned in this
work that some processes are more irreversible than others, that is, those that involve
self-organized structures that drastically increase the rate of entropy production, gen-
erate levels of irreversibility exponentially faster than processes that are passive.
Dissipation is an important element of the formation of nonequilibrium self-organized
structure because it helps to stabilize the dynamical equilibrium state by damping out
random noise Ô¨Çuctuations.
5.2.2 Implications on the Cosmological Evolution of Galaxies
The secular evolution scenario describes mainly a morphological transformation
process of individual galaxies. By itself this does not uniquely specify a cosmo-
logy. However, through its implications on the galaxy evolutionary pathways, the
secular evolution scenario gives strong hints at the essential elements of any cos-
mology that is to be compatible with it. For example, the secular evolution scenario
favors late-type disk galaxies to form relatively early in the cosmic history, and these
late-type galaxies subsequently undergo morphological transformation along the
(reverse) Hubble sequence mainly due to the mediation of internal dynamical pro-
cesses related to global structures such as spirals, bars, and 3D twisted isophotes.
Environmental effects can accelerate the evolution speed of individual galaxies, but
these environmental effects operate mainly through the mediation of internal global
instability structures, and not through the actual merging of galaxies.

5 Putting It All Together
5.2.2.1 Challenges Faced by the Lambda Cold Dark Matter Paradigm
The hierarchical clustering/cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, including its most
recent Lambda-CDM (LCDM) variant (Ostriker & Steinhardt 1995; Liddle 2003 and the
references therein; Mo et al. 2010 and the references therein), has been the most popu-
lar paradigm for structure formation over the past few decades. Historically, CDM type
of theories were invented partly to get around the problem that there was not sufÔ¨Åcient
time for the seeds of anisotropies observed on the cosmic microwave background,
about one part in 105, to grow into the nonlinear structures we see today by gravit-
ational means alone, since this would require primordial seeds of one part in ‚àº103 at
the time of recombination (z = 1,000). Furthermore, the standard Big Bang nucleosyn-
thesis model also requires a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of nonbaryonic dark matter (Dar 1995;
Fields, Freese, & Graff 2000).
Both of the above problems in fact do not necessarily require the existence of
nonbaryonic CDM. For example, the former problem can be solved in a primor-
dial turbulence scenario (von Weizsacker 1951a; Gamow 1952; Ozernoy 1974a, 1974b;
Bershadskii & Sreenivasan 2002, 2003; Bershadskii 2004), which leads to structure
formation due not solely to gravity, but also to initial (possibly supersonic) velocit-
ies of the primordial matter‚Ä†; while the latter situation can change signiÔ¨Åcantly if the
fundamental constants in the early universe vary from the values they have now, if
the laws are themselves emergent and evolve with the evolving universe. (see further
discussions in Section 5.2.2.4).
During past few decades of intensive search by international teams using a diverse
range of instruments, no direct evidence of the existence of the purported nonba-
ryonic CDM particles has been found. Furthermore, growing evidence points to serious
incompatibilities of the predictions of the LCDM paradigm with the accumulating
observational results both on the large scale and on the individual galaxy level.
In general, the LCDM paradigm prescribes a medium for structural formation
that is too clumpy on small scales, yet too smooth on large scales. For example, the
predicted but unobserved cusps for the central density proÔ¨Åles of low surface bright-
ness galaxies (de Blok 2010), as well as the predicted but unobserved overabundance
of small satellites of normal galaxies (Klypin et al. 1999), are both due to the over-
clumpiness of the assumed LCDM medium on small scales. So is the problem of
the formation of many small disks, which is related to the problem of rapid angular
momentum loss of the small clumps of disk material due to dynamical friction (White
& Frenk 1991).
On the other hand, the over-smoothness of the LCDM medium on largest scales
underlies its inability to account for the early formation of quasars and Ô¨Årst galax-
ies, as well as the early formation of giant high redshift clusters (Francis et al. 1997;
‚Ä† This should not come as a surprise: even galactic star formation is not due solely to gravity: most
of the stars form at spiral arms, now understood to be the site of collisionless shocks produced by the
potential-density phase shift condition.

271
Steidel et al. 1998; Williger et al. 2002; Coe et al. 2013; Oesch et al. 2016). In a
purely bottom-up structure formation scenario such as the LCDM, it is very difÔ¨Åcult
to account for the observed alignment of the spin axis of the bright galaxies in a
cluster (Ozernoy 1974a and the references therein; Plionis et al. 2003); the alignment of
substructures in a cluster (Plionis & Basilakos 2002); as well as the observed galaxy-
cluster-supercluster alignment effect on the largest scale (West 2001). Other known
observational evidence that conÔ¨Çicts that of the LCDM predictions include the large-
scale velocity Ô¨Çows (Watkins et al. 2009; Kashlinsky et al. 2009), and the proÔ¨Åles of
cluster halos (Broadhurst et al. 2005; Umetsu & Broadhurst 2008).
In the LCDM paradigm, large galaxies are formed out of the mergers of smaller
ones, and therefore should form last. Recent studies of high z galaxies have shown
that exactly the opposite is observed: that is, the larger the mass of a galaxy, the
shorter the time scale of its formation (Boissier et al. 2001; Thomas, Maraston, &
Bender 2002). This trend is the same as the so-called downsizing trend of galaxy form-
ation, not only in terms of the star-formation history but also in terms of the mass
assembly history (Cowie et al. 1996; Kodama et al. 2004; Cimatti et al. 2006; and
the references therein). This trend is in direct conÔ¨Çict with the CDM-type bottom-up
assembly scenario. While the former trend (downsizing in star formation) can perhaps
be accounted for by proposed mechanisms such as AGN or star-formation feedback
(see, e. g., de Lucia et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006 and the references therein), the lat-
ter trend of mass-assembly downsizing (Cimatti et al. 2006) is in direct conÔ¨Çict with
the mass assembly history predicted by LCDM, which is known to signiÔ¨Åcantly under-
predict the extremely red objects (ERO) observed in the early universe (Daddi, Cimatti,
& Renzini 2000 and the references therein), with EROs likely to be mostly large, mature
galactic systems.
Peebles (2002) compared the current state of cosmology with the state of physics
at the turn of the nineteenth/twentieth century, and commented that several known
problems of the CDM theories could potentially turn out to be the same type of
‚ÄúKelvin-level clouds‚Äù which a century ago ushered in the quantum revolution. These
problems include ‚Äúthe prediction that elliptical galaxies form by mergers at modest
redshifts, which seems to be at odds with the observation of massive quasars at z ‚àº6;
the prediction of appreciable debris in the voids deÔ¨Åned by L‚àógalaxies, which seems
to be at odds with the observation that dwarf, irregular, and L‚àógalaxies share quite
similar distributions; and the prediction of cusp-like dark matter cores in low surface
brightness galaxies, which is at odds with what is observed‚Äù (Peebles 2002). Other
more recent confrontations of LCDM predictions with observations are reviewed in
Walker (2014).
The secular evolution scenario we have presented in this work poses its own seri-
ous challenge to the LCDM paradigm. The magnitudes of the mass Ô¨Çow rates we have
derived for physical galaxies (i. e., those examples we have calculated in Chapter 4)
appear large enough to be able to result in signiÔ¨Åcant Hubble-type transformation
during the past Hubble time (i. e., 1 ‚Äì 10 solar masses a year of radial mass accretion

272
5 Putting It All Together
corresponds to 1010 ‚Äì 1011 solar masses during the past 1010 years, enough to build up
a massive central bulge in a Milky-Way-type galaxy in the lower mass Ô¨Çow rate cases,
and a disky elliptical in the higher mass Ô¨Çow rate cases). The calculated mass Ô¨Çow
rates are especially large for galaxies experiencing strong tidal perturbations (i. e.,
NGC 3627 and NGC 5194), due to the large-amplitude, open-density wave patterns
excited during these strong interactions, and due to the effective quadratic depend-
ence of the radial mass Ô¨Çow rates on both the wave amplitude and on the pattern
pitch angle.
From the galaxy rotation curves and mass Ô¨Çow rates we have presented in the
last chapter, we see that along the Hubble sequence from late- to early galaxy types,
more and more of the inner rotation curve is contributed by luminous baryonic matter
(a previously known observational fact), and furthermore, this growth of the import-
ance in the luminous matter in the central region of galaxies along the inverse Hubble
sequence is likely to be a direct result of secular radial mass accretion process (a result
that is new). A natural question then arises: what happens to the nonbaryonic CDM
in the central region of a galaxy as this evolution proceeds? The nonbaryonic CDM
particles could not simply be displaced by the baryonic matter since a well-known
result of the LCDM numerical simulations is the so-called adiabatic compression of
dark matter halos (e. g., see Sellwood & McGaugh 2005 and the references therein;
Binney & Tremaine 2008, pp. 337‚Äì338), that is, as the baryons become more centrally
concentrated, the dark matter particles should be dragged into the central potential
wells thus formed, and also become centrally concentrated. Thus, taking together the
facts of the observed decreasing importance of dark matter in the central regions of
galaxies of progressively earlier Hubble types; the newly demonstrated importance
of secular mass inÔ¨Çow process in transforming galaxy morphology from the late to
the early Hubble types; and the expected adiabatic compression process if the CDM
particles are indeed present, together imply that the main composition of the galactic
dark matter could not be nonbaryonic CDM particles.
5.2.2.2 On the Baryonic Composition of Galactic Dark Matter
We propose that at least on the scale of galaxies and clusters, the dark matter is
mainly composed of nonluminous Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHO) of a con-
tinuous mass spectrum, a small portion of which at the substellar mass range had
previously been revealed by microlensing observations (Alcock et al. 2000; Koopmans
& de Bruyn 2000; Shvartzvald et al. 2016).
One may argue that the current microlensing surveys have not uncovered enough
baryonic dark matter to account for what is needed to reproduce the galactic rotation
curves (Tisserand et al. 2007), and that the extrapolated initial mass function (IMF)
from star formation in the galactic plane does not seem to produce enough mass to
close the gap either (e. g., see Najita, Tiede, & Carr 2000 and the references therein).
We comment that the current microlensing observations may still be incomplete (espe-
cially regarding the environments this approach has so far been applied to); and

5.2 Broader Implications
273
some of the discrepancies from the IMF argument may be due to the fact that the
forms of IMF in different environments are different, that is, in the disk plane the
star formation is caused by spiral density wave shocks, thus producing a family of
stars that weighs heavily toward solar and higher-mass stars. The structures formed
in the quiescent environments of the halo and outer galaxy, as well as formed prim-
ordially through processes such as violent relaxation and primordial turbulence, on
the other hand, may weigh more toward the lower-mass spectrum. Thus we cannot
simply use the IMFs derived from star clusters in our own Galaxy to infer a univer-
sal IMF in more primordial formation environments, since the Galactic star clusters
themselves are heavily reprocessed entities which possess higher degrees of dynam-
ical relaxation/dynamical evolution. It is the process of reprocessing that allows the
Galactic clusters to rid much of the primordial material, including presumably the
dark baryons of substellar mass spectrum.
This scenario for the segregation of mass spectra in different environments is
supported by the following known observational facts (see in addition Freeman &
McNamara 2006 for a thorough historical survey of the dark matter research up to
the publication of that book): (1) Dark matter is known to be more abundant in objects
of primordial composition as well as lower degrees of dynamical relaxation, such as
dwarf galaxies and low-surface-brightness galaxies (de Blok 2010 and the references
therein), as well as other large but diffused galactic systems (van Dokkum et al. 2016
and the references therein). On the other hand, objects such as globular clusters,
which are of similar masses as the smallest dwarf galaxies, but of much higher degrees
of dynamical relaxation (as reÔ¨Çected in their much smaller diameters as compared to
dwarf galaxies), are known to be almost devoid of dark matter. (2) On the scale of
galaxy clusters, dark matter was sometimes found to be about 10 times as massive
as luminous matter. On the individual galaxy level, excluding the very early Hubble
types, dark matter is often between 10 and 100 times the mass of the luminous mat-
ter, with the fraction of dark matter correlating strongly with the relaxation/evolution
stage of a galaxy, rather than simply with its mass (Freeman & McNamara 2006). These
observed ratios of the dark matter versus luminous matter are all signiÔ¨Åcantly higher
than the cosmic nonbaryon-to-baryon fraction of 5:1 as inferred from Big Bang nucle-
osynthesis, as well as from the model-Ô¨Åtted CMB observations. This shows that one
cannot avoid taking into account the baryonic composition of a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of
dark matter, even if one adheres to Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the conventional
wisdom regarding the matter composition of the universe. This conclusion of the inev-
itability of the presence of dark baryons has also been reached previously from several
other lines of investigations (Persic & Salucci 1992; Fukugita, Hogan, & Peebles 1998;
McGaugh et al. 2010).‚Ä†
‚Ä† The recent discoveries of a signiÔ¨Åcant portion of the missing baryons as Ô¨Ålaments between galaxies,
and as hot gas in clusters, do not by themselves solve the missing baryon problem within individual
galaxies. This is so especially for dwarf galaxies, where as much as 99% of the mass are undetected,

274
5 Putting It All Together
The current proposal for a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of the galactic dark matter to be
composed of baryons makes the secular evolution picture more complete and more
coherent: since most MACHOs have smaller masses, they can be displaced to the
outer region of a galaxy as the galaxy‚Äôs dynamical relaxation advances as a result
of density-wave-induced radial mass Ô¨Çow ‚Äì this is a kind of generalized equipartition
or dynamical friction effect. This is supported by the observational fact that for early-
type galaxies, the dark matter is preferentially distributed in the outskirt of a galaxy,
whereas for later Hubble types the dark matter is more concentrated to the galactic
central region. A small fraction of the dark baryons, that is, the fraction that resides
close to the disk, could also be ignited through actual collisions while passing through
the density-wave-crest collisionless shock, or be incorporated into the star-forming
material, a process that also helps with the decrease of M/L ratio observed along the
reverse Hubble-sequence, as the secular evolution progresses.
The new proposal for the nature of galactic dark matter also makes the Hubble-
sequence galaxy structural properties Ô¨Åt comfortably together: The early-type galaxies
have cuspy central mass distribution because the baryons there are more concen-
trated through secular evolution. In certain early-type galaxies, such as NGC 4736, it
has been found that the contribution of dark matter to the total mass budget is very
small (Jalocha et al. 2008). The late-type galaxies, including dwarf galaxies and low-
surface-brightness galaxies, on the other hand, are dark-matter dominated but were
often found to have core-shaped mass distribution, contrary to the LCDM prediction
of central cusps (de Blok 2010). In the current scenario, since in late-type galaxies
secular evolution has just been launched, not enough baryonic matter resides in the
central region of a galaxy. Despite the dominance of dark matter over luminous matter
in the central regions of late-type galaxies, these baryonic dark matter do not lead to
cuspy density distributions since they have large random velocities.
The baryonic composition for dark matter Ô¨Åts well many known dark matter
observations on large scales, such as the colliding Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-558, Clowe
et al. 2006) and the Train-Wreck Cluster (Abell 520, Mahdavi et al. 2007; Jee et al. 2014),
which are difÔ¨Åcult to reconcile with the standard LCDM paradigm. For example, in the
Bullet Cluster, the inferred dark matter distributions cluster with stars in the outer
two lobes, and not with the gas in the middle of the collision remnant; whereas in
the Train-Wreck Cluster dark matter clusters with both the stars in the outer two lobes
and the dark components in dwarfs are not likely to be in gaseous form. Dwarfs are known to consist
mainly of the primordial material, i.e., with a closer-to-cosmic abundance for its mass content, com-
pared to massive galaxies, which makes it even more compelling to assume that most of the dark mass
in dwarfs are in fact dark baryons.
Furthermore, if stars and various forms of gas can already account for the entire cosmic baryon
budget according to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) model, the contribution of signiÔ¨Åcant addi-
tional dark baryons from individual galaxies will overrun the BBN baryon budget and cause a serious
conÔ¨Çict with it: this makes the implications of our current work all the more prescient. Evidence from
the current work suggests that the BBN model in its current form may not be suitable for constrain-
ing the baryon fraction of the universe, and the majority of galactic dark matter may in fact consist of
baryons.

5.2 Broader Implications
275
and with the gas in the central clump. A single nonbaryonic CDM species thus would
have difÔ¨Åculty in reproducing both of these observed distributions. In our new pic-
ture, since the baryonic dark matter is hypothesized to be of MACHO type with a wide
range of mass spectra (with its detailed composition possibly changing with environ-
ment), it can display variable degrees of dissipation. In the Bullet Cluster, the mass
spectrum of the baryonic dark matter is likely to lean toward substellar; whereas in
the Train-Wreck Cluster a more continuous spectrum from the substellar to the super-
dusty were likely to be present, and the collision dynamics serves as a graded sieve
to separate and rearrange these mass components along a continuous path. Rather
than due to the varying properties of self-interacting nonbaryonic dark matter as were
hypothesized in models of colliding clusters, it is more likely that the varying proper-
ties of baryonic dark matter itself are what were responsible for producing the varying
effective cross sections of the matter which formed these collisional remnants.
We comment here further that the reason for the preference of MACHOs as candid-
ates for a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of the galactic dark matter, as opposed to nonluminous
gaseous baryons that reside in the galaxy disk (e. g., Pfenniger & Combes 1994) is
due, Ô¨Årst of all, to the trend of properties seen along the Hubble sequence, that is,
the late-type disk galaxies have the highest dark matter contribution to their rotation
curves, and yet their (luminous) disks are the lightest. This is hardly consistent with
the disk-dark-baryon hypothesis if the dark and luminous baryons come in Ô¨Åxed frac-
tion. Secondly, from the modal theory of Bertin et al. (1989a, 1989b), density wave
morphology along the Hubble sequence is linked to the galaxy‚Äôs basic state proper-
ties. The fact that late-type galaxies have open and multiarmed spiral patterns requires
that their parent basic state has a dynamically nonresponsive halo, that is, it requires
the dark baryons to reside in a spherical conÔ¨Åguration, consistent with the MACHO
composition of dark baryons.
The observations of the Bullet Cluster are also inconsistent with the dark matter
being made solely of a dissipative gas component (either cold or hot gas). Nor are the
observations of the Bullet and Train-Wreck Clusters taken together consistent with the
dark matter being mainly black holes/neutron stars, or else massive neutrinos. The
latter, as a hot-dark-matter candidate, also conÔ¨Çicts with the observational evidence
that on the galactic (and oftentimes also cluster) scales the dark matter is found to
cluster mostly with the luminous matter (Freeman & McNamara 2006).
5.2.2.3 Formation of Realistic Galaxy Disks in the Cosmological Context
The present work concerns mostly with the long-term evolution of the morphology of
individual galaxies once a realistic basic state (i. e., the initial-boundary condition for
galaxy evolution) has been speciÔ¨Åed, and it does not speciÔ¨Åcally address the forma-
tion of galaxies in the cosmological context. However, some of our results do shed light
on the possible reasons for the past difÔ¨Åculty of forming galaxies with realistic rota-
tion curves and morphologies in the LCDM cosmological simulations (Navarro 2010;
White 2009, 2010).

In Figure 5.16, we plot the results of the modal morphology at time step 1,600 (when
the spiral pattern is close to being most prominent), from a simulation using a
computation grid similar to that used in Zhang (1998), i. e., 55 radial divisions and
64 azimuthal divisions, and a softening length of 1.5. We use a set of basic state spe-
ciÔ¨Åcation that varies the active disk to rigid halo mass ratio, with the rigid bulge mass
held Ô¨Åxed at 0.1, and with the total galaxy mass held Ô¨Åxed at a normalized value of 1.
The four panels in Figure 5.16 have mdisk : mhalo : mbulge varying from 0.4 : 0.5 : 0.1,
to 0.3 : 0.6 : 0.1, to 0.2 : 0.7 : 0.1, and Ô¨Ånally to 0.1 : 0.8 : 0.1, respectively. The length
scale of the disk, halo, bulge in the normalized units are 10, 5, 1, respectively, as in
Section 3.2.1.
From the four panels of Figure 5.16, we see that as the ratio of the mass of the rigid
halo component to the active disk component increases, with the mass of the rigid
bulge component itself held Ô¨Åxed, the spiral mode (shown near its maximum modal
amplitude stage) decreases progressively in prominence. For the last two frames, i. e.,
for the mass of the disk having 20% and 10% mass ratio, respectively, in terms of the

total galaxy mass, the spiral pattern is barely discernible. The rotation curves of these
four runs are given in Figure 5.17, which are seen to have varied little. Decreasing the
softening length does increase the prominence of the spiral patterns in all four frames,
but the trend of decreasing spiral prominence with decreasing disk-to-spheroidal ratio
is unchanged when varying softening.
Yet, from observations, we know that many light disks (e. g., our own Galaxy‚Äôs
disk) do contain prominent spiral structures. How do we explain this discrepancy? We
note here that the simulations presented in this work are done in two-dimensional
conÔ¨Ågurations, with the bulge and halo both held as dynamically inactive. There is no
back-response of the halo and bulge to the formation of the global spiral/bar modes
in the active disk. In real galaxies, if we take into account of the fact that the bulge
and halo components are likely both made of baryons, we can expect the active parti-
cipation of both these components to the formation of global modal instabilities, i. e.,
both the bulge and halo of a disk galaxy are expected to be partially rotationally sup-
ported, skewed, and participate in the self-organization and collective dissipation of
the single global modal set that unites the dynamical behavior of the disk and the
spheroidal components.
Therefore, we must interpret the active disk mass presented in the simulations
of this work as incorporating also the dynamical effect of those portions of the bulge
and halo that are actively participating in the global modal dynamical behavior of the
entire galaxy.
The LCDM halos, on the other hand, contain a high proportion of the nonbaryonic
dark matter particles that are pressure supported, thus cannot participate in the self-
organization and collective dissipation process of the global density wave modes.
This explains why past LCDM simulations of disk galaxy formation either produced
spiral structures accompanied with high central baryon content and (unrealistically)
high central rotation curves, or else produced realistic rotation curves but no spiral
structures when the baryonic content is maintained as per the LCDM prescriptions
(Navarro 2010; White 2010 and the references therein). The triaxiality of the LCDM

278
5 Putting It All Together
halos also leads to the secular tumbling of the embedded baryonic disks within the
CDM halo potentials (Yurin & Springel 2015), further endangering the long-term sur-
vival of especially the nested density wave modal sets (i. e., bar within spiral, or vice
versa), observed to have overwhelming presence in nearby grand design disk galaxies,
such as NGC 4321, which we have analyzed in Chapter 4.
Our above view is consistent with the recent observations of Ibata et al. (2013) of a
plane of dwarf galaxies corotating with the Andromeda galaxy, a fact that a pressure-
supported dark halo would have difÔ¨Åculty in reproducing. Similar observations by
Pawkowski, PÔ¨Çamm-Altenburg, & Kroupa (2012) for the distributions and kinematics
of satellites, globular clusters, and streams of the Milky Way Galaxy also pose severe
challenges to the standard LCDM galaxy formation scenario.
The difÔ¨Åculty of using the LCDM prescriptions to form disk galaxies with real-
istic properties thus appears to be intrinsic, and ad hoc procedures of using artiÔ¨Åcially
imposed feedback processes to get around the known difÔ¨Åculties of LCDM (see, e. g.,
Brooks 2014 and Vogelsberger 2014, as well as the references therein) ended up mim-
icking baryon-dominated galaxy dynamics. In a way, the recent progress on the
formation of disk galaxies in the LCDM context only highlighted the close ties of
the observed galaxy morphology and kinematics, as well as their inferred evolution
history, to the baryonic compositional characteristics of their galaxy mass.
We comment here that our assertion that a Hamiltonian system is capable of
exhibiting dissipation-like behavior can apply to the dark-matter component of the
mass as well, in principle, just as it applies to the stars that are nominally dissipation-
less. The real issue here is not whether the mass component is baryonic or not, but
rather a matter of initial conditions. Our particle simulations presented in Chapter
3 are able to display self-organization and collective dissipation behavior, because
our initial-boundary condition (i. e., the basic state) speciÔ¨Åcation is that of a differ-
entially rotating disk that allows the spontaneous emergence of a global density wave
mode. Such an initial condition is in fact the end stage of a dissipative collapse of a
primordial galactic clump, which involved the dissipation of the gas component that
subsequently formed stars. A spherically distributed particle cloud, even made with
stars and not with non-baryonic dark matter, and without mass segregation, will not
spontaneously form a differentially rotating disk. Thus, the possibility for the secular
morphological evolution of galaxies through density-wave-mode-induced collective
dissipation process in fact implicitly beneÔ¨Åted from the earlier dissipational process of
disk formation (as well as the formation of skewed baryonic halo, thick disk, and prim-
ordial bulge, as star formation proceeds within the skewed parent gas distributions in
these galactic components).
The non-baryonic dark halo, on the other hand, because of its heavy mass com-
pared with the baryon content, did not beneÔ¨Åt much from this earlier dissipative
collapse process to form the galactic disk. So the lack of participation of the CDM
dark halo in the collective process of the disk is not because of impossibility as a mat-
ter of principle, but rather because of the actual characteristics of the halo (i. e., its
massiveness and its initial three-dimensional distribution, which is a high-entropy

conÔ¨Åguration). The dissipation-like behavior possibly exhibited by a Hamiltonian sys-
tem is necessarily tied to a low-entropy initial conÔ¨Åguration (i. e., think of the paradox
of the mixing of gas initially conÔ¨Åned to the left compartment of a two-compartment
box, with the partition subsequently removed. The gas particles can be governed by
reversible equations, but the initial condition dictates that the entropy will increase
irreversibly after the partition is removed). Any self-gravitating system (including the
dark halo) has an arrow of time (Lynden-Bell & Wood 1968), but the speed for entropy-
increasing evolution can be very low without its being amenable to manufacturing
entropy-production-enhancing dissipative structures.
5.2.2.4 Generalize Mach‚Äôs Principle and the Origin of Fundamental Laws
As we have seen, the challenges faced by the LCDM paradigm are signiÔ¨Åcant. In other
branches of natural sciences and in mathematics, similar challenges had resulted in
scientiÔ¨Åc paradigm shifts in the past. Besides the examples of the quantum revolution
and the discovery of relativity theories, we also know that a fundamental paradox in
set theory, similar to the so-called barber‚Äôs paradox, discovered by Bertrand Russell
at the beginning of the 20th century, resulted in a paradigm shift in the foundation of
mathematical logic; and Godel‚Äôs incompleteness theorem in the 1930s revolutionized
our views on the limit of mathematical proof and the limit of the axiomatic construc-
tion approach. The challenges faced by the LCDM paradigm may turn out to be of the
same nature, as Peebles had earlier speculated. This crisis, however, is also a poten-
tial opportunity, as it may serve as the impetus for us to update our theories regarding
fundamental aspects of nature.
Many previous workers in the cosmological community have made attempts at
Ô¨Ånding alternatives to the CDM-based cosmological theories. Most of these, such as
the hot or warm dark matter theories, as well as the self-interacting dark matter theor-
ies, are still based on the idea of the nonbaryonic dark matter composition. The results
and implications of the current work, on the other hand, prompt us to look beyond the
conÔ¨Ånes of the current cosmological studies to reÔ¨Çect on the state of knowledge of our
fundamental physical theories as a whole.
As we have seen in the previous chapters, new meta-laws (i. e., the volume‚Äì
torque closure relation) governing the evolution of galaxy disks spontaneously emerge
when a new hierarchy of organization (i. e., the quasi-steady density wave modes)
appears. On the scale of the whole universe, we could likewise speculate whether all
of our physical laws might be emergent, together with the emergence of patterns of
organization in the natural world.
The success of applying the ideas of spontaneous symmetry breaking in both
condensed matter and high-energy physics gives us conÔ¨Ådence to generalize this
concept to other branches of physical sciences, but with a signiÔ¨Åcant caveat: the past
application of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum Ô¨Åeld theories is a purely
local procedure ‚Äì as the quantum Ô¨Åeld theory itself mostly is, which may account for

280
5 Putting It All Together
the need of renormalization. Whereas in the current work, we have seen that spon-
taneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of new meta-laws are oftentimes a
global and distributed process: the torque and mass-Ô¨Çow rate equations are expressed
in terms of basic state and density-wave modal parameters, which are determined
by a global feedback cycle and distributed dissipation processes. Furthermore, the
tight inter-relations between the emergent laws and the matter distribution in the
substratum in such a globally self-consistent treatment also lead to the co-evolution
of the emergent laws and the substratum with time, an element that the local Ô¨Åeld
theories by nature could not take into account. It is thus obvious that our current
model for fundamental interactions of nature, i.e., the standard model of elementary
particle physics, had not exhausted the novelties of interactions in nature, because of
its intrinsic inability to account for globally emergent processes in a self-consistent
manner. Without a globally consistent model of the universe, our patchy theories
in various physical disciplines are inevitably left with many empirically-determined
structure constants. These models with Ô¨Åtted constants have validity in their respect-
ive domains of application, of course. Our cautionary note here is mainly against
unwarranted complacency with regard to the current state of our knowledge of the
fundamental aspects of physical interactions, to point out the limitations of local treat-
ments in determining the values of fundamental constants, as well as to highlight the
prospect of these constants changing with time.
Examining closer in this direction, the fact that all fundamental laws in our uni-
verse are Lorentz-covariant (i. e., they satisfy Lorentz transform relations) points to
the likelihood of a relational origin of these laws. As is well known, the Lorentz trans-
form relations apply to Ô¨Çat space-time (i. e., they are special-relativistic transform
relations). Observational cosmology points to the likelihood of our universe being
nearly Ô¨Çat. Yet how did our fundamental laws become aware that the universe is Ô¨Çat
on a global scale, if the laws themselves are not emergent (i. e., relationally generated)
from the underlying matter and energy distribution? The possible globally emergent
nature of fundamental laws is also reÔ¨Çected in the action principle which underlies
the derivations of these laws; in the universality of fundamental constants appearing
in these laws; as well as in the quantized nature of fundamental exchanges, which
hints for its origin at a global resonant cavity of Ô¨Ånite size, likely the universe itself.
The hypothesis that the origin of natural laws lies in the matter and energy distribu-
tion in the whole universe, has been referred to as a ‚ÄúGeneralized Mach‚Äôs Principle‚Äù by
the current author, in reference to a more restricted version due to Ernst Mach positing
the origin of gravity and inertia in the global matter distribution.
Until we obtain an understanding of the origin of natural laws from this global
and relational point of view, it is premature to claim that we have in our possession
all the fundamental principles, and what is needed from here on is only to carry out
‚Äúprecision cosmology.‚Äù We need to keep an open mind of the provisional nature of
our cosmological models. Some existing models of the universe may demonstrate the
exclusion of the baryonic composition of dark matter, but models are merely models,
they are not the Ô¨Ånal arbiter of truth.

5.2.2.5 Secular Evolution as an Emerging Paradigm for the Cosmological Evolution
of Galaxies
It is in the spirit of the aforementioned considerations that the emerging secular evol-
ution paradigm could supply an added reality check when developing and testing our
cosmological models. In the results presented here, a clear picture emerges of the
secular morphological transformation of galaxies driven mostly by collective effects
mediated by large-scale density wave modes. This evolution is a well-coordinated
quasi-steady evolution, with the formation and transformation of large-scale density
wave modes compatible with the evolving basic state conÔ¨Ågurations. We thus expect
that at every stage of the transformation from the late Hubble type to the early Hubble
type, there should be a good correspondence between the basic state properties and
the characteristics of the density-wave modes, except during brief periods in a galaxy‚Äôs
life when it encounters strong gravitational perturbation from a companion galaxy.
New equilibrium states are expected to be restored once the perturbation ceases and
the galaxy adjusts its mass distribution and modal pattern to be once again mutually
compatible ‚Äì the reason these new equilibrium states are nearly always possible is
because for every basic state conÔ¨Åguration there is almost always a set of unstable
modes corresponding to it (Bertin et al. 1989a, 1989b).
As a result of this coordinated co-evolution of the basic state of the disk and the
density-wave modes, over the major span of a galaxy‚Äôs lifetime the effective evolution
rate depends on the stage of life a galaxy is in. Late- or intermediate-type galaxies,
having larger amplitude and open-density-wave modes in their outer disks, would
lead to larger mass Ô¨Çow rates and thus faster secular morphological transformation
rates; whereas for early-type galaxies the secular evolution activity is shifted to the
central region of a galaxy. In general, the secular mass Ô¨Çow rate in the outer disks of
early-type galaxies is low, and this is reÔ¨Çected in the modal characteristics as well,
i. e., early-type galaxies generally have either tightly wrapped spiral arms, or straight
bars, both correspond to small phase shift and thus small secular mass Ô¨Çow rate.
On the other hand, the secular evolution rate also depends on the interaction state
of a galaxy, with the galaxy in group or cluster environments generally having larger
evolution rates due to the large-amplitude, open, spiral and bar patterns excited dur-
ing galaxy interactions. We have shown earlier in this text that interaction-enhanced,
density-wave-mediated evolution appears to underlie the so-called morphological
Butcher‚ÄìOemler effect (Butcher & Oemler 1978a, 1978b) in rich clusters, as well as
the morphology-density relation originally discovered by Dressler (1980), and sub-
sequently shown to hold over more than 4 orders of magnitude in mean density,
spanning environments from Ô¨Åeld and groups, onward to poor clusters and rich
cluster outskirts, all the way to the dense cluster central region. The universality of
such a correlation is in fact a powerful illustration of the unifying role played by
‚Äúnurture-assisted nature‚Äù type of processes during galaxy evolution. The dependence
of morphology on environmental density shows that nurture plays an unquestionable

282
5 Putting It All Together
role in determining the average evolution rate; yet the well-known inverse correlation
of environmental density with merger rates shows that the effect of the environment
is not chieÔ¨Çy in the form of violent cannibalism, but rather through mild tidal perturb-
ations. Even the moderately violent and episodic ‚Äúharassment‚Äù type of direct damage
to galaxy morphology is known to be ineffective at transforming the morphology of
large disk galaxies: they are shown to mostly lead to the transformation of small disks
to dwarf spheroidals. These leave the most obvious driver for the observed morpho-
logical transformation of galaxies in different environments, and the origin of the
morphology-density relation, as the tidally enhanced density waves. However, as we
see in the current work, even for interacting galaxies like M51 and NGC 3627, the envir-
onment exerts its effect through the innate mechanism already present in individual
galaxies, i. e., the density waves that are excited during the interaction are mainly the
intrinsic modes, and the effect of interaction only enhanced the amplitudes of these
modes.
The Ô¨Çip side of this correlation of evolution rate with environment is that some
disk galaxies in isolated environments could have very small secular evolution rate
throughout the span of a Hubble time, which explains the observational fact that
many large disk galaxies in the Ô¨Åelds were found to have evolved little during the
past few Gyr. Still, isolated environment cannot be automatically equated to a slow
evolution rate. One of the most impressive examples of mass redistribution we have
encountered is the strongly barred galaxy NGC 1530, which lies in a surprisingly
pristine environment, i. e., nearly totally isolated. Yet NGC 1530 has by far the largest
mass Ô¨Çow rate of all the galaxies we have calculated, of more than 100 solar mass
per year, due to its large surface density and the presence of a strong set of bar-spiral
modal structure. This shows that the initial conditions that galaxies inherited at birth
are likely to have played an important role as well in determining the subsequent
morphological evolution rate.
The secular morphological transformation of galaxies along the Hubble sequence
also implies that the required external gas accretion rate to sustain the current level
of star formation rate in disk galaxies can be much reduced from the amount previ-
ously sought: as a galaxy‚Äôs Hubble type evolves from late to early, more and more of
its store of primordial gas will be exhausted, and its star formation rate will natur-
ally decline. But this is precisely the observed trend of star formation rate in galaxies
along the Hubble sequence, i. e., early-type disk galaxies do not have nearly as much
star formation activity as late-type galaxies. Galaxies thus do not have to sustain their
‚Äúcurrent‚Äù level of star formation rate over cosmic time, since what is current today will
be history by the next phase of their morphological evolution.
Finally, we note that the continuous evolution across the S0 boundary into disky
ellipticals may erase the distinction between pseudo-bulges and classical bulges, i. e.,
galaxies such as the Milky Way were previously thought to have classical bulges
because of its r1/4 central density proÔ¨Åle, yet the building up of the Galactic Bulge is
most likely through the secular mass accretion process over the past 10 billion years,
and the disky bulge can further relax into the r1/4-shaped bulge with time. In the end,

5.2 Broader Implications
283
as has already been pointed out by Franx (1993), there might not be a clear distinc-
tion between early-type disks and disky ellipticals, and only a gradual variation of the
bulge-to-disk ratio. The recent result from the ATLAS3D project of a signiÔ¨Åcant disk
component in all low-mass ellipticals (Cappellari et al. 2013) provides strong support
to this continuous evolution trend from late-type disk galaxies all the way to disky
ellipticals. Buta et al. (2010)‚Äôs result from analyzing the internal structures of early-
type galaxies also provides supports for continued secular evolution among early-type
disk galaxies, which further highlights the role of stellar mass accretion, since the
early-type galaxies have progressively less gas.
The secular evolution mechanism presented in this work is expected to be one
of the most important mechanisms in producing the Hubble sequence. This is both
because it is a physical mechanism intrinsic to the individual galaxy and is operating
throughout the lifetime of a galaxy ‚Äì including those that have been through a merger
‚Äì irrespective of the environment it is in; and also because of the recognition of spiral
structure in disk galaxies as an example of the general class of ‚Äúdissipative structures‚Äù
in nonequilibrium systems. The important function of any dissipative structures is to
greatly accelerate the speed of entropy evolution of the underlying nonequilibrium
system, and this special function is also achieved by the galactic spiral structure, i. e.,
the emergence of a galactic spiral structure greatly accelerates the speed of entropy
evolution of a disk galaxy (Zhang 1992) along the Hubble sequence from the late to the
early types.
The above being said, we want to emphasize also that many other previously
proposed mechanisms of galaxy formation and evolution, i. e., the variations in the
initial density perturbation (Eggen, Lynden-Bell, & Sandage 1962), the initial dissip-
ative collapse of a proto-galactic clump (White & Rees 1978), and subsequent angular
momentum acquisition via tidal torques (Hoyle 1953; Fall & Efstathiou 1980), as well
as mergers of spiral galaxies, satellite and gas accretion, are also expected to be oper-
ating with varying strengths in contributing to the formation of the Hubble sequence,
in addition to the internal secular evolution process that the current monograph has
been focusing on. Furthermore, some of the amorphous proto-galaxies seen in the
Hubble Deep Fields (HDFs) may be a class in their own right, i. e., they are neither
the merger product of two late-type disks, nor are galaxies that are evolving into
disk galaxies. Some of these objects may bypass the phase of formation of a well-
deÔ¨Åned thin disk, and evolve into spheroidal systems with the assistance of some
three-dimensional global instability structures. This is supported by the observational
fact that many of the high-z amorphous galaxies in the HDF images possess twisted
isophotes in their luminosity distribution (Fasano, Filippi & Bertola 1997). A central
thread that connects all of the above galaxy evolution scenarios, however, is the prin-
ciple of entropy-increasing evolution for an open and nonequilibrium system, and
the ability for self-gravitating systems to manufacture ‚Äútools‚Äù to enhance the rate
of entropy production and transport, these tools being either quasi-two-dimensional
as in disk galaxies, or quasi-three-dimensional as in the twisted isophotes in disky
ellipticals and in amorphous proto-galaxies.
