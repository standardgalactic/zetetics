Abstract
A central challenge in the progression of a variety of open questions in biology, such as
morphogenesis, wound healing, and development, is learning from empirical data how
information is integrated to support tissue-level function and behavior.
Information-theoretic approaches provide a quantitative framework for extracting
patterns from data, but so far have been predominantly applied to neuronal systems at
the tissue-level. Here, we demonstrate how time series of Ca2+ dynamics can be used to
identify the structure and information dynamics of other biological tissues. To this end,
we expressed the calcium reporter GCaMP6s in an organoid system of explanted
amphibian epidermis derived from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, and imaged
calcium activity pre- and post- a puncture injury, for six replicate organoids. We
constructed functional connectivity networks by computing mutual information between
cells from time series derived using medical imaging techniques to track intracellular
Ca2+. We analyzed network properties including degree distribution, spatial embedding,
and modular structure. We find organoid networks exhibit more connectivity than null
models, with high degree hubs and mesoscale community structure with spatial
clustering. Utilizing functional connectivity networks, we show the tissue retains
non-random features after injury, displays long range correlations and structure, and
non-trivial clustering that is not necessarily spatially dependent. Our results suggest
increased integration after injury, possible cellular coordination in response to injury,
and some type of generative structure of the anatomy. While we study Ca2+ in Xenopus

developed to analyze functional connectivity in neuronal tissues can be generalized to
any tissue and fluorescent signal type. Our framework therefore provides a bridge
between neuroscience and more basal modes of information processing.
Author summary
A central challenge in understanding several diverse processes in biology, including
morphogenesis, wound healing, and development, is learning from empirical data how
information is integrated to support tissue-level function and behavior. Significant
progress in understanding information integration has occurred in neuroscience via the
use of observable live calcium reporters throughout neural tissues. However, these same
techniques have seen limited use in the non-neural tissues of multicellular organisms
despite similarities in tissue communication. Here we utilize methods designed for
neural tissues and modify them to work on any tissue type, demonstrating how
non-neural tissues also contain non-random and potentially meaningful structures to be
gleaned from information theoretic approaches. In the case of epidermal tissue derived
from developing amphibians, we find non-trivial informational structure over greater
spatial and temporal scales than those found in neural tissue. This hints at how more
exploration into information structures within these tissue types could provide a deeper
understanding into information processing within living systems beyond the nervous
system.
Introduction
1
Information and its processing are widely accepted to play a central role in biological
2
function [1–4]. This critical role is particularly important in understanding the function
3
of neuronal tissues, and as such, information theoretic approaches have seen wide-spread
4
adoption as quantitative tools in neuroscience [5]. Insights into neuronal function from
5
these approaches include collective decision-making by groups of neurons, how
6
long-range correlations are structured across neural networks, and the structure of phase
7
transitions in networks of neurons to name a few [6–9]. However, communication and
8
information processing are exclusive to populations of neurons: these are embodied
9
processes throughout the cellular architectures of multicellular life [10,11]. Yet, the
10
application of information theoretic approaches has seen limited development towards a
11
universally implementable approach to quantify general tissue function and behavior to
12
understand the role of information in other tissue types beyond neuronal
13
examples [12–14].
14
In multicellular systems, cells must collectively coordinate their actions to regulate
15
the diverse range of processes essential to multicellular life: these include regulation of
16
pattern formation in development, morphogenesis, wound healing, regeneration, and
17
behavior among others. Communication and information sharing can even extend
18
beyond species-specific boundaries, as is the case for plant-animal interactions and in
19
symbiotic associations like lichen where multiple species are in direct coordinated
20
communication. Traditional techniques for characterizing coordination in non-neural
21
cellular tissues, thus far, include multielectrode arrays [15,16], planar cell polarity
22
analysis [17,18], physiological reporter dyes [19], immunohistochemistry [20], and
23
RNAseq [21,22]. These have provided important methods for gaining insight into
24
specific cellular function, such as, neural voltages at various cell stages, alignment, and
25
coordination of cells within a tissue plane, distribution and localization of biomarkers,
26
and global ligand and receptor interactions [23]. However, an open challenge is

capturing the longer temporal and spatial scales necessary to characterize information
28
processing associated with collective behavior and coordinated decision making across
29
entire tissues and whole multicellular organismal systems.
30
One approach available to capture these longer-range dynamics is provided by
31
functional connectivity (FC) networks derived from information theoretic analyses of
32
signal data. These networks provide a quantitative framework for identifying
33
connections and information flow over spatial and temporal scales relevant to the
34
coordinated function of entire tissues [24]. FC networks are weighted, undirected
35
networks generated based on instantaneous statistical correlations, or statistical
36
dependencies, between activity in different areas of a system. They are often employed
37
in the field of neuroscience to quantify temporal correlations in activity between
38
different regions of the brain, as in the case of correlated neural firing between regions
39
of the brain which can reveal correlated behavior, even if the regions are spatially
40
separated [25]. Information theory provides a set of mathematical tools to quantify such
41
correlations, where measures such as mutual information [26] and transfer entropy [27]
42
applied across temporally sampled data can be used to construct FC networks that
43
capture nonlinearities and structure not apparent in static images. A predecessor and
44
contemporary approach to constructing FC networks is anatomical connectivity maps,
45
which focuses on physical tracts that can reveal direct anatomical links between
46
different physical regions in a tissue. However, these do not capture the long range
47
temporally correlated structures, which need not be in direct physical contact, which
48
are revealed in FC networks. Therefore, we adopt the approach utilized in the study of
49
networks of neurons to develop applications of the same kind for implementation to
50
other multicellular tissues. We anticipate such studies will provide a complement to
51
existing approaches, by allowing a new window into understanding tissue function
52
through understanding FC over longer spatial and temporal scales.
53
A commonly used signaling molecule is Ca2+, which is found across nearly all living
54
systems. Ca2+ is held both inter- and intra-cellularly and can be used for tracking rapid
55
physiological responses to a wide range of events [28,29]. Tracking Ca2+ across a tissue
56
sample therefore provides the opportunity for better understanding information flow
57
and use at the level of cellular networks, including cellular communication and
58
information transfer in the context of basal and perturbed states [30,31]. Indeed,
59
fluorescent reporters of Ca2+ are now widely used within neuroscience to track and
60
quantify cellular function and have formed the foundation of information theoretic
61
analyses to understand information processing in neuronal networks [32,33]. Ca2+ is
62
also known to regulate epithelium healing across diverse model species (fish, chick, frog,
63
mouse, human) [34–37], though most work to date has focused on rapid events
64
(milliseconds to seconds) such as at the time of wounding or neuron firing. Due to this
65
limited observational limit it is not known if long range events exist and/or contribute
66
to the informational structure in a tissue. Herein, we demonstrate evidence of such
67
long-range correlations via FC networks, which suggest in our system either has a
68
storage of memory or long-range coordination of cells in wound healing.
69
To explore information processing and its relation to function in a non-neural tissue,
70
we expressed mRNA encoding the calcium reporter GCaMP6s in an organoid system of
71
embryonic explanted amphibian epidermis derived from the African clawed frog
72
Xenopus laevis [38,39]. This modified self-assembling system, composed of the
73
developing epidermal cells, was selected for its well characterized cell types and diverse
74
uses in self-organization, cell polarity, stem-cell differentiation, wound healing, human
75
pulmonary disease, and biomaterial science [40–47]. To show an explicit example of
76
tracking whole tissue-level behavior using these approaches, our primary focus is on how
77
cellular networks respond to perturbation by inducing a mechanical puncture wound.

organoids and track intracellular Ca2+ over time. From these time series, we construct
80
FC networks using bivariate mutual information between cells to infer internal
81
informational structure in the tissue. Topological and communicational properties of the
82
networks, such as mesoscale community structure, degree distribution, and spatial
83
embedding, were characterized to better understand how epidermal cells respond to
84
perturbation, and what controlling parameters are retained by cellular communities
85
isolated from their host. We find that Xenopus ex-vivo tissue self-organizes into
86
non-trivial informational structures that can serve as proxies for the intact organism,
87
displaying a pronounced mesoscale network topology. Furthermore, the organization of
88
the tissue is flexible, restructuring itself in response to the puncture and thereby
89
demonstrating a dynamic response to wounding. While we focus on the application of
90
these methods to epidermal tissue herein, our approach is generalizable to any tissue
91
type and fluorescent signal. In what follows, we outline the process of generating the FC
92
networks, review what structures they reveal, and discuss the future directions for using
93
information theory to uncover larger scale temporal and spatial functional structure in
94
multicellular tissues.
95
Constructing functional connectivity networks using
96
experimental data derived from multicellular tissues
97
To examine the informational structure of a non-neuronal tissue, we tracked calcium
98
transience in a vertebrate model of wound healing, using developing Xenopus laevis
99
embryos as our source material. At the Nieuwkoop and Faber stage 2 (4-cell stage,
100
Fig 1A), each of the 4 cells were injected with two mRNA transcripts, one encoding the
101
fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6s, the other encoding the intracellular domain of
102
the notch protein (Notch ICD) to inhibit motile-cilia formation on the developing
103
epidermis [48–51]. Knockdown of motile cilia was necessary to prevent rotational
104
movement of the organoid which complicates downstream image registration efforts.
105
After 24 hours of development at 14◦C, the animal cap of the embryo was excised
106
manually with surgical forceps (Fig 1B, red circle) and cultured in a saline media.
107
Following an additional 24 hours of development (Fig 1C), the developing spheroid of
108
tissue can be left untreated or compressed (Fig 1D) to produce a flattened morphology
109
amenable to 2D fluorescent microscopy.
110
Calcium imaging was performed 7 days post-fertilization, at which time the
111
epidermal organoid was fully differentiated, containing 3 distinct cell types on the
112
surface: mucus producing goblet cells, small secretory cells, and ionocytes [40,41,52].
113
Preliminary studies found that a capture rate of 1 frame per 5 seconds was sufficient to
114
identify individual calcium flashes across the surface of the tissue without inducing
115
phototoxicity. Individual frames of the timelapse dataset (Fig 1E) were subtracted from
116
subsequent frames in the stack (Fig 1F) to identify cells presenting calcium flashes
117
(Fig 1G, H). This imaging setup was found to be stable over the duration of 10-20
118
minutes. The experimental setup consisted of 10 minutes of organoid imaging in its
119
basal state, preceded by a centrally located puncture wound delivered via a pulled glass
120
capillary, followed by an additional 10 minutes of organoid imaging during wound
121
resolution (Fig 1I, J). A total of 6 organoids were imaged in the experimental setup, all
122
at 7 days of development to reduce age related variance in downstream analysis.
123
Kymographs are frequently utilized to visualize calcium topography following
124
wounding, as time is represented as a dimensional axis. When employed on the organoid
125
injury dataset, systemic calcium activation is readily observed, and resolved, over the
126
course of 100s (Fig 1Ki, ii, red box). The sharp transition noted at 0s (Fig 1Kii) is an
127
artifact of imaging, as the time series omitted the moment of puncture when the needle

occluded the optics, and re-centering the sample was necessary following injury. This
129
method proved sufficient to capture the large-scale calcium changes in direct response to
130
injury, matching previous reports of lacerations in the same system [53]. Interestingly,
131
when kymographs were expanded beyond the standard time frame convention prior and
132
post injury by the order of thousands of seconds, different structures could be observed
133
in the data in the form of less frequent flashes by individual cells (Fig 1Kii, teal arrows).
134
This is the first evidence of non-trivial long-range correlations within the informational
135
structures of non-neural tissues.
136
Fig 1. Long-term calcium transience in vertebrate epithelium in the basal
state and following injury. Calcium transience within these tissues displays more
diverse structures when longer timescales are observed. The kymograph analysis
standard timescale is on the order of milliseconds, when applying this to the punctured
explant revealed no discernible dynamics even when expanded to the order of hundreds
of seconds. When opened to the order of thousands of seconds new structures are
observed within the tissue. What these structures represent requires further
investigations beyond the scope of kymograph analysis.
Statistical analysis of these flashes to determine structure is limited in kymograph
137
representations, due to the nature of the linear slices used in the method (Fig 1Ki, teal
138
line) which occluded the less frequent signals. Thus, to analyze this data for more
139
complex information structures prior to, and post injury, FC maps were utilized for
140
whole-image analysis. We therefore performed a coarse-grained analysis and visual

inspection of the global calcium signal, which revealed a sharp increase in signal at the
142
time of puncture (t = 0s in Fig 2A, B). The signal remained high and unstable for a
143
period following puncture, which varied in duration across organoid samples. During
144
this time, organoids shifted in position due to force imparted from the glass capillary.
145
These movements were too great to correct for using conventional image registration
146
software and were thus excised from the video. Resulting in two distinct videos per
147
organoid: one capturing the basal state behavior prior to puncture damage (pre-
148
puncture) and the other capturing behavior post damage once the organoid had settled
149
(post- puncture). Pre- and post- puncture videos were processed and analyzed
150
independently. Smaller translational and rotational movements between frames were
151
corrected using ANTs image registration software in Julia [54]. After organoid
152
alignment, temporal averaging of the images was used to produce a representative image
153
that could be supplied to the deep learning cell segmentation model, Cellpose (Fig 2C,
154
G) [55]. Preliminary experiments explored optimal model parameters for each organoid,
155
however, performance was highly dependent on image quality. Models performed
156
suboptimal in regions that were out of focus and/or of high fluorescent intensity where
157
cell boundaries were obscured. Thus, the segmented cells identified were spread
158
non-uniformly across the organoid. Pixel intensities within each identified cell boundary
159
were extracted and averaged in each frame to produce a time series of calcium readings
160
localized to individual cells at every time step (Fig 2D, H).
161
Some common problems in analyses such as these arise in managing global artifacts
162
and autocorrelation. Global artifacts, observed in many organoids, include the steady
163
decline in signal at the beginning of pre- and post- puncture videos. To remove this,
164
global signal regression (GSR) is used; the global signal, acquired by taking the average
165
of all cells’ time series, is subtracted from each cell’s individual time series. Additionally,
166
to remove any autocorrelation, time series were “whitened” by computing the local
167
conditional entropy rate, a measure of instantaneous information that cannot be learned
168
from observing a cell’s own past signals [56,57]. These preprocessing steps produce
169
flattened time series with emphasized flashes where there are changes in signal not
170
resulting from autocorrelation or a global artifact (Fig 2E, I). Here, FC is computed as
171
the temporal correlation in activity between pairs of identified cells where correlation is
172
measured as non-zero significant mutual information and activity refers to calcium
173
intensities localized to individual cells. This translates to how much information the
174
flashing pattern of one cell discloses about that of other cells; high functional connection
175
indicates that observing the calcium signal of one cell in a pair provides a lot of
176
information regarding the signal of the other. FC networks thus represent the intrinsic
177
signaling dynamics of a given system over the entire spatial and temporal scale available
178
for analysis. FC network architecture of the epidermis tissue was examined at both the
179
basal state and in response to an injury. Nodes represent identified cells in the
180
organoids and edges represent the magnitude of functional connection (Fig 2F, J).
181
Investigating their properties and organization yields insights into the information
182
structure of this complex, non-neural tissue, and the differences in structure pre- and
183
post- puncture perturbation.
184
Functional connectivity networks pre- and post-

186
FC is a time-averaged, pairwise measure of correlation. Unraveling this measure in the
187
time dimension produces an edge time series of instantaneous correlations between pairs
188
of cells’ signals. Edge time series of post- puncture networks were seen to have more
189
highly correlated edges at the beginning of the post- puncture observation period (Fig 3,

these results suggest increased integration among cells via highly correlated Ca2+
197
signals soon after undergoing puncture damage with quick stabilizing back to a baseline.
198
Interestingly, some of the edge-time series display bands of high-amplitude, global
199
co-fluctuations (Fig 3, O2-post, O4-pre, O6-pre), known as events in neuroscience.
200
These intermittent episodes have previously been observed in human brain data [58] and
201
are linked to the presence of a complex underlying generative structure in the
202
anatomy [59]. The significance of seeing high amplitude events in organoid tissue is
203
currently unclear, but we propose that it may be a fingerprint of a non-trivial
204
interaction structure among the cells as the anatomy of the tissue is nearly uniform and
205
organized similar to a checkerboard, with alternating cell types at regular intervals.
206
Further research is planned in this area.

Fig 3. Edge time series, computed as the element-wise product of two z-scored
calcium time series, measures instantaneous co-fluctuation between pairs of nodes pre-
(left) and post- (right) damage for each organoid (top row in quadruplet).
Co-fluctuations are plotted by the magnitude away from the mean; red signifies is above
the mean, blue is below, and are interpreted as how strongly the cells are functionally
connected. Root sum squared (RSS) amplitude shows the points in time where many
cells collectively co-fluctuate (bottom row in quadruplet). In pre- puncture networks
there is no clear pattern in co-fluctuations across the organoids, though in post-
puncture networks there is a general decrease from strong co-fluctuations and
amplitudes to some baseline levels.
Network analyses were implemented to interrogate and characterize the structure of
208
the FC networks, including computing network density and number of edges and nodes
209
(S1 Fig). Degree distributions give the number of edges connected to a given node
210
providing a good corollary to global network structure. Networks both pre- and post-
211
puncture display degree distributions with heavier tails and higher maximum degree as
212
compared to our null model (Fig 4). Null models were constructed for each network by
213
averaging degree distributions from an ensemble of 100 Erd˝o R`enyi random graphs,
214
constructed with the same number of nodes and edges as the corresponding empirical
215
network. These differences between the empirical and null models suggest that networks
216
both pre- and post- puncture are not random, but rather contain nodes that are much
217
more connected than expected by random chance (i.e., the empirical network contains
218
hub nodes). Correspondingly, there are also more nodes with fewer connections than

(negative Spearman correlation coefficients in Fig 5B, S1 Table). That is, our data
230
supports a conclusion that spatially closer cells generally have more coordinated
231
signaling patterns. Such a finding is in accordance with known signaling in non-excitable
232
tissues, in which adjacent cells are connected structurally via an extracellular matrix
233
and extracellular ligand-receptor interactions, and internally via gap junctions allowing
234
the passage of small molecules between neighbors [60,61]. Spearman correlation

Another method we implemented to uncover non-trivial structure is community
239
detection, which reveals the modular nature of the networks by identifying groups of
240
cells that are highly functionally connected regardless of physical location. Community
241
detection was performed using multiresolution consensus clustering [62] with the
242
Louvain method [63,64]. Such clustering algorithms work by organizing nodes into
243
groups that maximize the number of within-group edges and minimize the number of
244
between-group edges. FC matrices, square matrices with nodes on both axes (i, j ∈V )
245
and entries colored by the magnitude of functional connection between nodes i and j,
246
are sorted by modular structure, placing nodes within the same community next to one
247
another on the axes. Thus, modules differentiate as squares along the diagonal with
248
high levels of FC (Fig 6A). Modules can be interpreted as clusters of cells with large
249
statistical dependencies between cells within the cluster compared to those outside the
250
cluster. The cause of such integrated clusters is not readily obvious; however, as shown
251
in Fig 5, spatially closer cells appear to have more correlated signaling dynamics and
252
thus modules might appear as groups of cells clustered in space. Unexpectedly, this is
253
not always the case. Spatial visualization of the three largest communities both in the
254
organoid (Fig 6B) and the FC network (Fig 6C) reveal that while some communities are
255
indeed clustered in space (Fig 6B, C, green and orange modules), others contain nodes
256
that are spread across the entire organoid (Fig 6B, C, blue module). This is further
257
emphasized by observing the distribution of within-module and between-module
258
distances, normalized by the maximum distance between two cells in the organoid,
259
across all samples (Fig 6D). Within-module distributions both pre- and post- puncture
260
have clear peaks at small distances but also extend to larger distances – a noticeably
261
distinct shape compared to the smooth normal distribution formed by between-module
262
distances. This unique shape both validates the existence of spatial clustering of
263
communities across organoids but also suggests modular structure is not entirely
264
spatially dependent and there may be non-trivial functional correlations present in the
265
more spread-out modules. To further uncover underlying characteristics of this modular
266
structure, we employed a participation coefficient measure in which each node is scored
267
based on the number of unique communities its neighbors in the FC network belong
268
to [65]. Nodes in post- puncture networks are connected to a significantly higher fraction
269
of modules (i.e. have more diverse neighbors) than before puncture, again hinting at an
270
increase in integration among cells following puncture perturbation (Fig 6E).

Discussion
272
Here we have demonstrated the use of a general, information-theoretic approach for the
273
large-scale spatiotemporal analysis of functional connectivity in a non-neural organoid
274
system. Mutual information was employed as a measure of the correlations between
275
segmented cells’ calcium transience in an organoid as it experiences, and subsequently
276
recovers from, a puncture wound. The approach utilizes information-theoretic and
277
regression preprocessing techniques to control for autocorrelation and global artifacts in
278
the data, ensuring meaningful correlation is captured in the resulting FC networks. We
279
find non-trivial, non-random FC network structure consistent across organoids both pre-
280
and post- puncture. These networks possess characteristics well-known in other
281
biological systems such as heavy-tail degree distributions and banding behavior,
282
corresponding to events of high amplitude co-fluctuations.
283
Consistent with what is known about calcium signaling in epidermal tissue, we find

that the functional connection between cells shows negative correlation with the
285
distance between them. This, however, does not preclude the presence of long-range,
286
high-magnitude functional connections. In fact, modular analysis of the networks
287
revealed the existence of highly correlated, spatially diverse communities of cells. The
288
cause of such modules could be explained by several features, including the three cell
289
types spaced at regular intervals across the organoid surface, which may have individual
290
calcium dynamics, or the propagation of non-observable signals below the outer layer of
291
cells. However, discriminating between these possibilities will require additional analyses
292
that will be the topic of future work.
293
In the face of perturbation, networks retain key characteristics defining their
294
structure such as heavy tail degree distributions and the presence of hub nodes, as well
295
as similar spatial embeddings and modular structures pre- and post- puncture.
296
Interestingly, however, our results suggest an increase in integration among cells shortly
297
post- puncture as evidenced by the heightened correlation at the beginning of the post-
298
puncture edge time series. Such a finding suggests that the information structure is
299
dynamic and able to restructure itself in response to damage. However, we were unable
300
to discern any reliable signatures of this phenomenon from the data. For example, these
301
might have included statistically significant results indicating an increase in
302
high-magnitude long-range connections post- puncture. Or subtle differences in modular
303
structure, which we could not identify due to limitations in this study, such as the small
304
sample size of N = 6 organoids and relatively short time series.
305
An additional limitation in the approach we present is the requirement of the
306
segmentation of individual cells over time from fluorescent microscopy data – a
307
notoriously challenging task. Image segmentation algorithms are susceptible to poor
308
performance when cell boundaries are obscured due to blurry or out of focus regions of
309
the image or regions in which there is widespread high intensity (i.e., a tissue wide
310
calcium flash). The recordings used in this study suffer from a combination of these two
311
challenges. Furthermore, the mechanical puncture event displaced the organoids,
312
preventing image registration software from being applied to an entire event by
313
recording it continuously. Thus, preprocessing and analysis of pre- and post- puncture
314
observation periods of the organoid were carried out in isolation leading to pre- and
315
post- puncture videos having inconsistent segmented cells. Comparing networks with
316
different numbers and placements of nodes renders direct comparisons between pre- and
317
post- puncture networks challenging and thus, we were severely limited in the analyses
318
we were able to perform. A focus of future work will be on experimental methods for
319
less disruptive perturbations to enable tracking of the sample throughout the entire
320
observation period. Despite these limitations, we have displayed the potential of these
321
tools and believe that with more data at our disposal this could be a very powerful and
322
comprehensive approach to non-neural tissues.
323
Aside from increasing the quality and quantity of data, future work will explore the
324
use of other measures of dependency between cell activity: the FC approach is
325
undirected and does not account for time-directed effective connections (where the past
326
state of one cell influences the future state of another). Measures of effective
327
connectivity such as the transfer entropy may provide a more refined perspective on
328
information “flow” by considering temporal directionality of signals [27]. Furthermore,
329
there has recently been an explosion of interest in the phenomena of
330
higher-order/beyond-pairwise interactions in complex systems [66,67], and many of the
331
tools that have been developed could be easily slotted into the general framework we
332
present here [68–70]. We outline a flexible approach to the problem of inferring
333
structure from data, and prospective users have considerable freedom to tailor the
334
approach to different notions of “structure”, including directed or undirected, temporal
335
or atemporal, pairwise or higher-order, and so-on.

Biologically, the use of information theory can identify long-term signaling dynamics
337
within tissues to serve as the basis for developing and testing hypotheses about the
338
nature of information processing and its relation to whole-tissue function. While no
339
mechanistic biological claims are made from the data presented herein, significant
340
changes in network modularity, including neighborhood diversity, can be observed pre-
341
and post- injury. Are these changes instructive or merely an epiphenomenon of the
342
healing process? Suppression, or enhancement, of these networks via calcium signaling
343
activators and inhibitors could help shed light on this question [71]. Other related
344
questions include: how do network dynamics change in the face of different types of
345
injury, from mechanical, to thermal, to chemical? What are the relative contributions of
346
each cell type to the network dynamics? Are correlated longer-range events associated
347
with specific cell types? Do mutations mimicking human disease alter network
348
modularity in addition to tissue function? Are network dynamics evolutionarily
349
conserved among diverse taxa, or do they diverge between related species? Or across
350
individuals within a species? All of these are important questions worth exploring,
351
though each may not require the generation of novel tools and methods. The described
352
approach, along with a growing palette of complementary computational tools, shows an
353
avenue that currently available tools are generalizable to diverse biological systems and
354
will likely reveal several hidden signaling modalities across them currently unexplored or
355
understood.

Materials and methods
357
Animal Husbandry
358
All experiments were conducted using tissue sourced from the amphibian Xenopus
359
laevis. Wild type embryos were collected 30 minutes post-fertilization and raised in 0.1x
360
Marc’s Modified Ringer’s solution (MMR), pH 7.8, until microinjection at the 4-cell
361
stage and animal cap excision at Nieuwkoop and Faber stage 9 [72]. Experimental
362
procedures using animals for experimental purposes were approved by the Institutional
363
Animal Care and Use Committee and Tufts University Department of Laboratory
364
Animal Medicine under protocol number M2020-35.
365
Microinjection
366
Microinjection of synthetic mRNA was performed at the 4-cell stage using a pulled glass
367
capillary, with each of the 4 cells being injected to ensure ubiquitous expression across
368
the embryo. Synthetic mRNA was synthesized from a linear DNA template using
369
commercially available kits (Life Technologies), which was stored at -80◦C until used.
370
Directly prior to injection, cohorts of healthy wild type embryos were transferred to a
371
laser etched petri dish containing 3% Ficoll solution. The 4 individual cells of each
372
embryo were then injected with a pulled glass capillary, delivering approximately 500 ng
373
of mRNA in 50nL of volume to each cell. After healing for 1 hour, the embryos were
374
washed twice in 0.1x MMR, pH 7.8, to remove the Ficoll solution, and any damaged
375
embryos were discarded before moving the dish to a 14◦C incubator. Two mRNA’s were
376
co-injected in the reported work; GCaMP6s, a reporter of calcium activity [73,74], and
377
the intracellular domain of Notch (Notch ICD), which is known to inhibit multiciliated
378
cell induction in developing frog epidermis [50,75,76]. Multiciliated cells were
379
molecularly inhibited in the current study as the presence of these motile structures
380
causes the mucociliary organoid to move during observation, complicating image
381
analysis [77–79].

Modified organoid generation
383
At Nieuwkoop and Faber stage 9, the animal cap of each embryo was removed to
384
generate epidermal organoids. Cohorts of injected embryos were transferred to a Petri
385
dish containing 0.75x MMR, lined with 1% agarose to reduce cell/tissue adherence.
386
Using a pair of sharpened microsurgery forceps, the vitelline membrane of each embryo
387
was removed, and the animal cap (the central portion of the pigmented top of each
388
embryo) was surgically excised and inverted in the dish. These explants are known to
389
develop into irregular epidermis if untreated [38–40,78,80]. Following excision, the
390
remainder of the embryos were discarded, and the tissue was allowed to heal into a
391
spheroid over the course of 3 hours at room temperature. Following healing, the
392
developing tissue moved to new dishes containing 0.75x MMR and 5 ng/µl gentamicin,
393
lined with 1% agarose, and placed back at 14◦C. After an additional 24 hours of
394
development, the animal caps were placed under a glass coverslip for 3 hours at room
395
temperature, generating continuous compression, which resulted in a permanent
396
flattened tissue which improved optical measurements. Following compression, the
397
explants were kept at 14◦C for 5-6 further days of development until imaging, at which
398
point the tissue had differentiated into a modified epithelial organoid.
399
Imaging
400
All calcium imaging was performed on an Olympus BX-61 microscope equipped with a
401
Photometrics CoolSNAP DYNO CCD camera and CoolLED pE-300 light source.
402
Individual organoids were placed in a depression slide containing 0.75x MMR under a
403
4x objective. Images were captured using a FITC filter at a rate of 1 frame every 5
404
seconds, across a total 20 minutes of observation. Capture rate was determined by pilot
405
studies which identified the minimum time scale to record calcium flashes in individual
406
cells, while also minimizing exposure to illumination to avoid photobleaching and/or
407
phototoxicity. For the first 10 minutes, basal rates of calcium activity were recorded.
408
After 10 minutes the image capture was paused, and a pulled glass needle with a
409
tapered tip diameter of 10-15µm was used to place a puncture near the center of the
410
organoid. Tip diameter was chosen to minimize overall damage to the organoid, and the
411
depth of the wound traversed the entire width of the tissue. Immediately following
412
injury, image capture was reinitiated, and proceeded for an additional 10 minutes of
413
observation. Each organoid was imaged, and injured, individually before being
414
transferred to a new dish, separate from the samples awaiting processing. Between each
415
observation period, the glass depression slide was washed with distilled water, cleaned
416
with a Kimwipe (Kimtech Science), and loaded with fresh 0.75x MMR to avoid sample
417
contamination across trials. Organoids were imaged across two successive days of
418
development, corresponding to Nieuwkoop and Faber embryonic stages 37-40. All
419
images were captured in tiff format and combined into AVI video files for computational
420
analysis using the FIJI software package [81].
421
Video preprocessing
422
A series of preprocessing steps were performed to transform the videos into time series
423
of calcium intensities for each identified cell in the organoids over time. The puncture
424
event caused extreme movement of the organoids as well as a high intensity flash of
425
calcium across the entire organoid obscuring cellular boundaries, making it difficult to
426
track cells throughout the course of the entire video. Full videos were therefore
427
separated into two distinct videos: pre- and post- puncture event. The end of the pre-
428
puncture video was aligned with the time of puncture and the start of the post-
429
puncture video was aligned with the end of immediate high intensity flash that the

puncture caused. Image registration was performed on each pair of videos to correct for
431
rotational movement of the organoids, improve the quality of video with a flatfield
432
correction, and do any necessary video cropping. This process was carried out using
433
Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) software [54]. Motion correction aligns cells in
434
the organoid throughout time such that a segmentation algorithm can be applied to the
435
time-average of all frames in the video to obtain cell boundaries for the entire series.
436
Cellpose [55], a generalized deep learning model, was used for cellular segmentation.
437
Hyperparameters of the Cellpose model were tuned for each video based on visual
438
inspection (cell diameter = 15, cell threshold = −2.0, flow threshold = 0.8, resample =
439
False). Pixel intensities within each cell boundary were extracted and averaged at each
440
frame to produce a time series of calcium intensities. These steps result in two time
441
series arrays (pre- and post- puncture) of size # cells × # frames for each organoid (S1
442
Fig, S2 Table).
443
Signal preprocessing
444
Utilized here was an information-theoretic pipeline to infer pairwise statistical
445
dependencies between individual cells. Information theory has been previously discussed
446
as a general framework for inferring systems-level structures in complex, biological
447
systems [30,82]. Two signal preprocessing steps were applied to emphasize underlying
448
structures in the data and allow for more meaningful inferences: global signal regression
449
and data whitening. Global signal regression attempts to remove global artifacts by
450
regressing out the mean signal across all cells. Data whitening involves removing
451
autocorrelation from the time series. Calcium imaging data is highly
452
autocorrelated [83,84] which can reduce the effective degrees of freedom between
453
interacting variables, complicating the inference of dependencies between signals [85].
454
To address this, we took a whitening approach inspired by Daube et. al., 2022 [56]: the
455
calcium data for every cell was transformed into time series of the instantaneous local
456
entropy rate, which contains only that information that is not disclosed by the cell’s
457
own past.
458
For a given cell, X, at every time t, the information content of the observation xt is
459
given by the local entropy:
460
h(xt) = −log P(xt)
(1)
Where P(xt) is the probability of observing X = x. The local entropy (also called
461
the Shannon information content, or surprisal) quantifies how much information about
462
the state of X is disclosed by the observation of xt. This information can be
463
decomposed into two components:
464
h(xt) = h(xt) = h(xt|xt−1) + i(xt−1; xt)
(2)
where i(xt−1; xt) is the information about xt that could be learned by observing the
465
immediate past xt−1 (sometimes called the local active information storage [86,87]),
466
while h(xt|xt−1) is the remaining information that could not be learned by observing
467
the past (sometimes called the local conditional entropy rate [86]).
468
By transforming the calcium imaging time series into a series of local conditional
469
entropy rates, we effectively whiten the signal: every moment is independent of the
470
moment prior to it and contains only that information that could not have been learned
471
by observing X’s own past. This remaining information could come from two places:
472
intrinsic randomness in X’s own dynamics, or from perturbation by another cell Y ,
473
whose activity informs on X’s own activity. All local entropies were estimated using
474
Gaussian estimators and computed using the JIDT [88] and IDTxl [89] packages.

Finally, after whitening, excessively noisy frames associated with recording artifacts
476
were deleted. Frames where the absolute value of the change in local entropy rate were
477
greater than two times that standard deviation were classified as outliers and removed.
478
The classifications were manually checked by visual inspection as well, to ensure only
479
artifact frames were removed.
480
Functional connectivity network inference
481
Undirected networks for each time series were generated based on instantaneous
482
correlation (functional connectivity) [25]. Nodes of these networks are identified cells
483
and edges are functional connections between each pair of cells in the network computed
484
as the Gaussian mutual information between the pair’s signal time series.
485
Gaussian mutual information was computed based on the identity:
486
I(X1, X2) = −ln(1 −r2)
2
(3)
where r is the Pearson correlation coefficient between X1 and X2. The transformation
487
into mutual information was chosen as the mutual information, unlike the Pearson
488
correlation coefficient, is strictly non-negative, a key desiderata when analyzing
489
networks. Edges were retained only if the significance associated with the mutual
490
information computation was greater than or equal to α ≤10−3 (Bonferroni-corrected
491
against the number of possible edges in the network).
492
Co-fluctuation & edge time series
493
The co-fluctuation analysis was done following the method described in Zamani
494
Esfahlani et. al., 2020 [58]. Briefly, each pair of nodal time series was z-scored and
495
multiplied together elementwise to construct an edge time series, where the value of the
496
series at a given time reflects the degree to which those two edges were co-fluctuating
497
together or in opposite directions. Then, the root sum squared deviation from the mean
498
was computed framewise to identify how global co-fluctuations are distributed
499
throughout the duration of the recording (see [59], for more details on high-amplitude
500
co-fluctuations).
