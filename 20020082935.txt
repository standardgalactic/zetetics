PREFACE
The
Sixth
Microgravity
Fluid
Physics
and
Transport
Phenomena
Conference
provides
us with
the opportunity
to
view
the current
scope
of the Microgravity
Fluid
Physics
and
Transport
Phenomena
Program
and
conjecture
about
its furore.
The
Microgravity
Program
has
become
part
of the newly
established
Office
of Biological
and
Physical
Research
(OBPR),
NASA's
fifth
Enterprise.
Meanwhile,
we
commenced
the long-awaited
and
exciting
era of conducting
Microgravity
Fluid
Physics
experiments
on the
International
Space
Station
(1SS).
We
successfully
completed
the Physics
of Colloids
in Space
(PCS)
experiment
on
1SS and
launched
the Investigating
Structure
of Paramagnetic
Aggregates
of Colloidal
Emulsions
(lnSPACE)
experiment
that
will
be conducted
later
this
year.
The
excitement
of utilizing
1SS was
tempered,
however,
by its cost
problems
that
negatively
impacted
the
research
budget
available
for developing
flight
experiment
facilities
and
hardware.
As a result,
the Microgravity
Fluid
Physics
discipline
took
a significant
budget
reduction
that
caused
deferral/discontinuation
of a number
of flight
investigations
that
had
successfully
completed
their
peer-reviews
and received
their
endorsement.
The
budget
supporting
the principal
investigators
was
also
negatively
impacted,
though
to a smaller
extent.
On the
positive
side,
the
Fluids
Integrated
Rack
(FIR)
that
supports
much
of fluid
physics
experiments
survived
these
budget
reductions.
Also
the
subsequent
support
of the research
community
through
letters
to Congress
and
to NASA
clearly
showed
how
the research
community
values
the
Microgravity
Fluid
Physics
and
Transport
Phenomena
Program.
In March,
NASA
Administrator
Sean
O'Keefe
created
the Research
Maximization
And
Prioritization
(REMAP)
Task
Force
to perform
an independent
review
and
assessment
of research
priorities
for the entire
scientific,
technological,
and
commercial
portfolio
of the Agency's
Office
of Biological
and
Physical
Research
(OBPR)
and
to
provide
recommendations
on how
the office
can
achieve
its research
goals.
The
panel
report
was
released
on
July
10, 2002.
The
recommendations
of this
panel
placed
almost
all of the
research
content
of the
Microgravity
Fluid
Physics
Program
in Priority
1 or 2 putting
the
program
in an advantageous
position
as NASA
begins
to
implement
the recommendations
of the panel.
The
program
currently
has
a total
of 106 ground-based
and
16 candidate
flight
principal
investigators.
A look
at the
collection
of abstracts
in this
document
clearly
shows
both
the high
quality
and
the
breadth
of the
ongoing
research
program.
One
can easily
notice
many
established
world-class
scientists
as well
as investigators
who
are early
in their
career
poised
to achieve
that
stature.
We
hope
that many
of the participants
in this
conference
will
perceive
microgravity
fluid
physics
as an exciting
and
rewarding
area
of research
and
choose
to participate
in the NASA
Research
Announcement
released
in December
2001.
Proposals
submitted
to the
fluid
physics
research
area
are due
December
2, 2002.
More
information
can be found
at the
following
Web
site:
http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_u/nra/current/N
RA-01-OBPR-08/index.html
The
content
of the Microgravity
Fluid
Physics
and
Transport
Phenomena
Program
is well
aligned
with
OBPR's
mission
of "conducting
basic
and
applied
research
to support
human
exploration
of space
and
to take
advantage
of the
space
environment
as a laboratory
for
scientific,
technological,
and
commercial
research."
The
fluid
physics
discipline
has
a major
role
in the
Physical
Sciences
Division's
goal
of developing
a rigorous,
cross-disciplinary
scientific
capability,
bridging
physical
sciences
and
biology
to address
NASA's
human
and
robotic
space
exploration
goals.
We have
implemented
a number
of changes
in the format
of this
conference
based
on the inputs
received
from
the
participants.
We have
expanded
plenary
sessions
to include
all presentations,
eliminated
parallel
sessions
and
expanded
the
exposition
session
with
poster
presentations.
We hope
that
this
will
allow
the participants
to get
a better
picture
of the overall
program
through
the plenary
presentations
and
promote
focused
discussion/dialogue
through
poster
presentations.
The
Discipline
Working
Group
has
provided
the much-needed
guidance
in planning
the content
and
the
format
of this
conference.
As
in the
past,
we
elected
to go with
a virtual
proceedings
of the
presentation
charts
that
will
be available
on the
World
Wide
Web
at http://www.ncmr.org/events/fluids2002.html.
In this
regard
we
acknowledge
the
support
of our
principal
investigators
who
have
provided
us timely
inputs
of their
charts
and
abstracts
and
accommodated
our
format
requirements.
This
cooperation
was
critical
in implementing
this
and
is very
much
appreciated.

ABSTRACT
The
Physics
of Hard
Sphere
Experiment
has
two incarnations:
the first
as a scattering
and
rheology
experiment
on STS-83
and
STS-94
and the second
as a microscopy
experiment
to be
performed
in the future
on LMM
on the space
station.
Here
we describe
some
of the quantitative
and
qualitative
results
from
previous
flights
on the dynamics
of crystallization
in microgravity
and
especially
the
observed
interaction
of growing
crystallites
in the
coexistance
regime.
To
clarify
rheological
measurements
we also present
ground
based
experiments
on the low shear
rate
viscosity
and
diffusion
coefficient
of several
hard
sphere
experiments
at high
volume
fraction.
We
also
show
how
these
experiments
will
be
performed
with
confocal
microscopy
and
laser
tweezers
in our lab and as preparation
for the phAse
II experiments
on LMM.
One
of the main
aims
of the microscopy
study
will
be the control
of colloidal
samples
using
an array
of applied
fields
with
an eye toward
colloidal
architectures.
Temperature
gradients,
electric
field
gradients,
laser
tweezers
and a variety
of switchable
imposed
surface
patterns
are used
toward
this control.
Interaction
between
growing
crystallites.
One
of
the
salient
features,
which
has
not
been
emphasized
in previous
experiments,
is the existence
of strong
interactions
between
individual
crystallites.
In Figl,
from
t=150s
to about
800s,
the size of the crystallites
increases
linearly
L=t _,
o_-1,
while
the crystallinity
X over
this
interval
increases
at
a
rate
considerably
less
than
L 3. Thus
the
c_
(N
number
of
crystallites
decreases
roughly
as
N_c=t -v, 7~2.6.
This
is
unusual
and
contrasts
with
the
lo
classic
theory
that
focuses
on
the
nucleation
and the growth
in size of
isolated
crystallites.
We identify
this
_
'
process
as
"'simultaneous
coarsening
and
growth"
in
which
o
small
crystallites
shrink
and
eventually
disappear,
causing
the
°'_'
number
of
crystallites
to
decrease,
while
large
crystallites

crystallites.
Because
of the
different
curvatures
of these
crystallites,\the
smaller
crystallites
are
under
higher
pressure
from
the Laplace
or surface
tension
term
and hence
have
a high
internal
volume
fraction
value.
Therefore,
the
corresponding
equilibrium
liquid
volume
fraction
surrounding
a small
crystallite
is relatively
higher
than
that
surrounding
a large
crystallite.
Mass
transport,
via these
density
gradients
in the intervening
fluid dispersion,
moves
particles
from
the
small
crystallites
to the large ones.

For this study
we used
bare

ABSTRACT
Two-dimensional
(2D)
ordering
of
macromolecules
is
of particular
interest
due
to their
scientific
importance
as fundamental
models
for studying
phase
transitions
and self-assembly.
It
is also
a basis
for
the
design
and
development
of many
biosensor
and
bioassay
devices
and
engineered
biomaterials.
The
ability
to create
and
manipulate
self-assembled
structures
of
macromolecules
requires
a thorough
understanding
and
control
of the
various
intermolecular
forces
involved.
In this study,
we used
2D streptavidin
crystallization
as a model
system
to study
2D protein
organization
on lipid bilayers
and their
effect
on bilayer
properties.
We
studied
the
crystallization
of
streptavidin
on
giant
lipid
bilayer
vesicles.
Giant
Unilamellar
Vesicles
(GUVs)
are
composed
of a single
lipid
bilayer
membrane
with
sizes
of
approximately
10-100
microns
in diameter.
Due to the sensitivity
to ionic
species,
they
remain
stable
in
only
extremely
low
ionic
strength
solutions.
Once
bound
to
the
vesicle
surface,
streptavidin
crystallized
to form
a rigid
polycrystalline
shell
surrounding
the vesicle.
The
ability
to create
crystals
on GUVs
provides
a means
to study
many
crystals
in a single
experiment
and in
a microgravity
environment.
Transmission
Electron
Microscopy
(TEM)
images
of negatively-
stained
vesicles
revealed
that the crystals
are of the lowest-density
C222
symmetry,
and does not
change
with
solution
pH unlike
those
grown
in high
ionic
strength
conditions.
The lack of higher
density
2D crystal
forms
is due to the strong
electrostatic
repulsion.
Despite
the presence
of only
one crystal
structure,
the change
in solution
pH changed
the macroscopic
crystal
morphology
and
crystal
growth
pattern,
and the vesicles
were
distorted
into
either
roughened
spheres
or football-
shaped
ellipsoids.
Micropipette
aspiration
of avidin-coated
and streptavidin-coated
vesicles
revealed
the unique
mechanical
properties
of the protein-lipid
membrane.
Vesicles
coated
with
the noncrystallizable
avidin
shows
relatively
similar
elastic
area expansion
modulus
to that
of uncoated
vesicles.
The
existence
of
crystalline
domains
on
streptavidin-coated
vesicles
resulted
in various
unique
mechanical
properties.
Rapid
permanent
deformation
was observed
at low
strain,
while
a slower
viscoelastic
behavior
was
observed
at
higher
deformation.
Despite
their
extremely
rigid
appearance,
the presence
of an external
polycrystalline
shell
does
not
increase
the toughness
of
the
vesicles
beyond
that
of
bare
vesicles.

ABSTRACT
Flight
experiments
are planned
for an interdisciplinary
study
of waves
(i.e.,
phonons)
in 3D
Coulomb
lattices.
The
experimental
system
will
be
a
suspension
of
charged
polymer
microspheres
in a gas-discharge
plasma.
This
so-called
"dusty
plasma"
is a macroscopic
system
where
the
microspheres
arrange
themselves,
due
to their
mutual
repulsion,
in a lattice.
Like
a
colloidal
suspension,
this
lattice
can be in a crystalline
or liquid
state.
The
particles
are imaged
directly
using
video
microscopy.
These
experiments
are an extension
of 2D experiments
performed
in the laboratory,
under
gravity
conditions.
Sedimentation
due to gravity
causes
the microspheres
to settle
rapidly
into
a
2D layer
that is levitated
by the strong
electric
field
near
an electrode
in a plasma.
By eliminating
gravity,
it is possible
to fill a 3D volume
with
the suspension.
Experiments
will
focus
on the
shear
acoustic
wave
in the
lattice.
This
kind
of
wave
has
particle
motion
that
is transverse
to the
direction
of wave
propagation.
Our
experiments
will
exploit
the low
damping
of a dusty
plasma
as compared
to colloidal
suspensions.
We will excite
the waves
using
a manipulation
laser,
which
applies
a radiation
pressure
on the particles.
Particle
motion
will
be
measured
in-situ
using
direct
imaging
with
video
microscopy.
After
the
experiment,
we
will
analyze
the
video
data
by
computing
the
particle
velocities
and
then
analyzing
the wave
motion
of the particles.
The experiment
is to be performed
on-orbit
in ISS,
with
accommodation
probably
in the FIR.
Preliminary
tests of the experimental
procedures
will be done
in parabolic
aircraft
flights.
The two experimental
tasks
for the flight
experiments
will be:
1.
Study
the
dispersion
relation
(i.e.,
phonon
spectrum)
of
sinusoidal
waves
and
the
propagation
of pulsed
waves.
These
experiments
will be performed
with plane
waves.
2. Study
the formation
of Mach
cones,
which
are the V-shaped
wakes
or shocks
created
by a
supersonic
disturbance.
In this experiment,
a moving
laser spot is the supersonic
disturbance.
These
experiments
build
on our laboratory
experience
with these
waves
and Mach
cones
in a
2D lattice.
This
earlier
work
has been
carried
out as a ground-based
project
funded
by the Fluid
Physics
discipline
of NASA's
microgravity
program.
Some
of the results
of these
ground-based
experiments
are described
below.
A 2D hexagonal
lattice
sustains
two
wave
modes,
for
particle
motion
in the
plane
of the
lattice.
These
modes
are the
longitudinal
and
transverse
sound
waves.
We
report
experimental
results,
supported
by theory
and simulations,
demonstrating
the properties
of these
two
waves.
NASA/T_2002-211211

The
waves,
which
are
observed
by
measuring
the
particle
velocities,
can
be
excited
by
two
mechanisms
in the lab:
laser manipulation
and thermal
particle
motion.
Using
laser
manipulation,
we
excited
both
modes.
An argon
laser
beam
was directed
toward
the
lattice,
where
it pushed
the
particles
about
with
a spatial
and
temporal
variation
that
we
controlled,
using
scanning
mirrors.
For
low
laser
power,
we verified
that both
waves
obey
their
linear
dispersion
relations
[1] for a Yukawa
inter-particle
repulsion.
We found
that this provides
a
method
of measuring
charge
and screening
length
with
considerable
precision.
In contrast
to the
longitudinal
wave,
the
transverse
mode
has
a dispersion
relation
with
a
more
linear
relationship
of f vs. k, i.e.,
a
more
dispersionless
characteristic
over
a wide
range
of k [2].
We found
that
Mach
cones
can be excited
which
consist
not
only
of
the
longitudinal
wave,
as reported
earlier
[3],
but
also
the
transverse
wave.
A Mach
cone
is
excited
by
a
moving
laser
spot,
as
shown
in the figure.
The
other
waves
are
excited
by
a stationary
sheet
of
light
that
is modulated
temporally.
By
using
a
higher
power
for
the
laser
sheet,
we
excited
weakly
nonlinear
longitudinal
waves,
which
propagated
faster
than
the
sound
speed
for
small
amplitude
waves.
In
the
absence
of
external
particle
manipulation,
we found
that
natural
thermal
particle
motion
consists
of
a spectrum
of
both
kinds
of waves,
where
the wave
energy
is
distributed
over
values
of f
and
k that
satisfy
the
linear
dispersion
relation,
as
shown
in the first figure
[4].

In
earlier
work Ill it was
shown
that the strength
and
frequency
of an applied
electric
field
alters
the dynamic
arrangement
of particles
on an electrode.
Two-dimensional
'gas,'
'liquid'
and
'solid'
arrangements
were
formed,
depending
on the
field
strength
and
frequency.
Since
the
particles
are similarly
charged,
yet
migrate
over
large
distances
under
the influence
of steady
or
oscillatory
fields,
it is clear
that
both
hydrodynamic
and electrical
processes
are involved.
Here
we report
on an extensive
study
of electrically
induced
ordering
in a parallel
electrode
cell.
First,
we
discuss
the
kinetics
of
aggregation
in
a DC
field
as
measured
using
video
microscopy
and digital
image
analysis.
Rate
constants
were
determined
as a function
of applied
electric
field
strength
and particle
zeta
potential
(Fig. 1). The kinetic
parameters
are compared
to
models
based
on electrohydrodynamic
and electroosmotic
fluid
flow
mechanisms
Second,
using
monodisperse
micron-sized
particles,
we examined
the
average
interparticle
spacing
over
a wide
range
of
applied
frequencies
and
field
strengths.
Variation
of
these
parameters
allows
formation
of
closely-spaced
arrangements
and
ordered
arrays
of
widely
separated
particles
(Fig.
2). We find
that
there
is a strong
dependence
on frequency,
but there
is
surprisingly
little
influence
of the electric
field
strength
past
a small
threshold.
Last,
we
present
experiments
with
binary
suspensions
of
similarly
sized
particles
with
negative
but unequal
surface
potentials.
A a long-range
lateral
attraction
is observed
in an AC
field.
Depending
on the frequency,
this
attractive
interaction
results
in a diverse
set of aggregate
morphologies,
including
superstructured
hexagonal
lattices
(Fig.
3).
These
results
are discussed
in
terms
of
induced
dipole-dipole
interactions
and
electrohydrodynamic
flow.
Finally,
we
explore
the implications
for practical
applications.

Fluid

result
in
an increase
of the lamellar

This flow-induced

of microstructures
is analyzed
analytically
to show
the relationship
between

and the operating

The
resulting
system
is a set of ordinary

describe
the evolution
of triple

In a weak-flow
regime
lamellar
widths
at the minimum

a scaling
similar

modified
by the flows.
When
the flows
are strong,
a new
scaling
law shows
that
the width
is proportional
to one-fourth
power
of the imposed

rate.
Lamellar

then tilt into the flow.
Only
at large morphological

the minimum

ABSTRACT
When
a liquid
drop
of given
dielectric
constant,
resistivity
and viscosity
is translating
in a
liquid
of different
dielectric
constant
resistivity
and viscosity
under
Stokes
flow conditions
in
the presence
of an electric
field,
the resulting
internal
circulation
is a superposition
of the
Hadamard-Rybcynski
circulation
and the circulation
first
described
theoretically
by G. I. Taylor
[1]. For sufficiently
strong
electric
field strengths,
the quadrapole
structure
of the Taylor
circulation
can cause
an internal
stagnation
disk to occur
[2].
Our interest
is in the situation
where
a modulation
of the electric
field causes
the stagnation
disk to modulate
its position,
potentially
leading
to chaotic
flows
within
the drop.
The dimensionless
electric
field
strength
is
characterized
by W = 4V(1 +_)/U,
where
V is the maximum
interfacial
velocity
of the Taylor
circulation,
U the translational
velocity,
and _ the viscosity
ratio.
The streamfunction
for the
flow
is:
lit= (r4-r 2) sin2(0)
+ W(t)
(r 3 -
r 5) sin 2 (0) cos(0)
(1)
W(t)
= Wl + W2 cos(_t),
(2)
where
e is the dimensionless
frequency,
and
Wl,
W2
are the amplitudes
of the DC and AC
components,
respectively.
We have
found
it useful
to replace
these
parameters
by a secondary
set, e, Wmax, and 8 = (1/W1
-
1/W2
) - (1/W1
+ 1/W2
).
As shown
in Figure
la,
8 is the
dimensionless
distance
the stagnation
disk moves
over one period
of modulation.
The advection
equations
corresponding
to the flow
in (1) were
integrated
by standard
techniques,
and it was
found
that the trajectories
were
chaotic
over
a wide
range
of parameters
[3].
Figure
lb shows
a
typical
Poincar6
section,
indicating
that a large
percentage
of the drop
may become
well-mixed

over a large number
of periods.

Experiments
were
conducted
to test the predictions
of rapid
mixing
on convective
time
scales.
Drops
of silicon
oil were
suspended
in a small
60 mm x 120 mm
x 120 mm test cell filled
with castor
oil, and subject
to time-modulated
axial
electric
fields
with
a wave
form
corresponding
to eq(2).
The drops
were
typically
5 mm in diameter
and settled
with typical
speeds
of
0(10
-1 mm/s).
Once
formed,
the drops
were
inoculated
with
small
scattering
particles
and illuminated
in an equatorial
plane
by an Argon-ion
laser.
Fields
of O(10 -1 kV/mm)
and
frequencies
of O( 10 -2 Hz) resulted
in typical
values
OfWmax = 20, _ = 8,
8 = 0.4.
The resulting
advection
of the particles
was imaged
by a CCD
camera,
which
collected
images
over a number
of modulation
periods.
In order
to make
comparisons
between
these
images
and the
corresponding
theory,
the trajectories
of a large number
of particles
(typically
O(104))
were
simulated,
with
initial
positions
approximately
the same
as in the experiments.
Figure
2a shows
a typical
image,
recorded
after
6 periods
of modulation.
As can be seen,
the
particles
are not confined
to the spherical
section
in which
they began,
and the mixing
pattern
has particular
geometric
features.
The corresponding
simulation
for the same
set of parameters
is shown
in Figure
2b. As can be seen,
there
is good qualitative
agreement
between
the two.

In summary,
our work
has shown
that it is possible
to drive
chaotic
advection
within
drops
using
time-modulated
electrical
stresses,
and that the resulting
mixing
is rapid,
being
achieved
over a few modulation
periods,
and is in good
agreement
between
theory
and experiment.

ABSTRACT:
Dynamic
wetting,
the displacement
of one fluid by another
immiscible
fluid on a surface,
controls
many
natural
and technological
phenomena,
such
as coating,
printing,
spray
painting
and lubricating.
Particularly
in coating
and
spraying
applications,
contact
lines
advance
across
pre-existing
fluid
films.
Most
previous
work
has focused
on contact
lines
advancing
across
films
sufficiently
thick
that
they
behave
as simple
Newtonian
fluids.
Ultrathin
films,
where
the
film
thickness
may
impinge
on fundamental
length
scales
in the fluid,
have received
less
attention.
In this talk,
we will discuss
the effects
ofultrathin
polymer
films
on dynamic
wetting.
We
measure
the
interface
shape
within
microns
of
moving
contact
lines
advancing
across
pre-
existing
films
and
compare
the
measurements
to
existing
models
of
viscous
bending
for
interfaces
advancing
across
dry surfaces
and
"thick"
(in the
sense
that
they
behave
as liquids)
films.
In
the
experiments,
we
advance
a
contact
line
of
10-poise
and
1-poise
polydimethylsiloxane
(silicone
oil) across
pre-coated
films
of the same
fluid
with thickness
from
a single
chain
thickness
(~10
]_) through
a couple
of radii
of gyration
(100-200
]_) to films
so
thick
they
are likely
bulk
in behavior
(10
3 ]k).
All films
are physisorbed,
i.e. they
readily
rinse
from
the surface.
Thus,
molecules
in the
film
are not
anchored
to the
surface
and
can
move
within
the film if the hydrodynamics
dictate
such motion.
For
films
of the thickness
of a single
chain
(~10
]_), our
experiments
indicate
that
the
advancing
fluid behaves
just
as it would
if it advanced
over
a dry surface.
For the thicker
films
(103
]k),
we
find
behavior
indicating
that
the molecules
in the film
are acting
as a fluid
with
the
bulk
properties.
In
this
regime,
results
for
the
two
different
fluids
are
identical
when
the
experiments
are
performed
at
the
same
pre-existing
film
thickness
and
advancing
capillary
number,
Ca.
For
film
of
thickness
of
a few
radii
of gyration
(~100-
200
]_), the
behavior
depends
on Ca of the advancing
meniscus.
At low
Ca, the viscous
bending
of the interface
near
the
contact
line
does
not
behave
as it would
on a dry
surface.
It has
a lower
curvature
than
expected.
However,
at higher
Ca, the viscous
bending
is described
by the model
for
spreading
over
a dry
surface.
These
results
show
that
the fluid
flow
in the
film
does
behave
differently
than
bulk
as the film
thickness
becomes
comparable
to molecular
length
scale.
But even
more
intriguing
is the
unusual
velocity
dependence
of
that
behavior
where
the
film
behaves
more
solid-like
at higher
contact
line speeds.
We will discuss
these
results
in terms
of the properties
of
confined
polymer
melts.

PASSIVE
AND
ACTIVE
STABILIZATION
OF
LIQUID
BRIDGES
IN
LOW
GRAVITY

ABSTRACT
The
cylindrical
liquid
bridge
of
arbitrary
size
surrounded
by
air
or
vacuum
is
a fluid
configuration
that
is
essentially
unique
to
the
zero-gravity
environment.
An
associated
technology,
which
is enhanced
in zero
gravity,
is the float-zone
process
of crystal
growth,
which
involves
a molten
liquid
bridge
between
a feed rod and the growing
cylindrical
crystal.
There
are
several
advantages
to the crystal
growth
process
in using
long molten
zones.
Unfortunately,
long
liquid
bridges
are more
susceptible
to g-jitter
[1].
Also,
a cylindrical
liquid
bridge
in zero
gravity
is unstable
if its length
exceeds
its circumference,
or stated
in another
way,
when
the
slenderness,
defined
as the length
to diameter
ratio,
exceeds
re.
This
is the well-known
Rayleigh-Plateau
(RP)
instability
involving
the growth
of a varicose
mode
leading
to breaking
of the bridge.
Stabilization
of liquid
bridges
in air in the
low-gravity
environment
of
NASA's
KC-135
aircraft
has
been
demonstrated
for
slenderness
values
in
excess
of
4.0
using
two
techniques,
passive
acoustic
stabilization
(PAS)
[2]
and
active
electrostatic
stabilization
(AES)
[3].
The
PAS
method
is
theoretically
capable
of stabilizing
a bridge
of any
length,
provided
a sound
field
of appropriate
dimension
is available.
The AES
method
in its current
form
controls
only
the
(2,0)
mode
of the
bridge,
which
is the varicose
mode
that becomes
unstable
when
the slenderness
(S) exceeds
re. By
controlling
only the (2,0)
mode,
the current
form
of the AES
method
cannot
stabilize
cylindrical
bridges
beyond
S=4.493
at which
point
the (3,0) mode
becomes
unstable.
At present,
the longest
bridge
stabilized
on the
KC-135
by
the
AES
method
had
a slenderness
of 4.4
[3].
The
AES
method
has the
advantage
that
it can be used
to control
both
the frequency
and damping
of the
(2,0)
mode
of the bridge.
This
would
be useful
in reducing
the
susceptibility
of a long
molten
zone to g-jitter
in that
the (2,0)
mode
frequency
could
be shifted
away
from
a particularly
noisy
vibration
frequency
band
of the
spacecraft
and
the
response
further
reduced
by
control
of the
damping
of the mode.
The principle
behind
the AES
method
is to sense
the (2,0)-mode
amplitude
and then
apply
a
mode-coupled
feedback
stress
to control
the mode
dynamics.
Two
concentric
ring electrodes
are
used
to produce
a Maxwell-stress
distribution
that
couples
into the (2,0)
mode
of the bridge.
By
applying
a feedback
stress
in proportion
to the
(2,0)-mode
amplitude
with
appropriate
gain,
the
mode
frequency
can be raised
and bridges
can be stabilized
beyond
S=rc.
Models
show
that
the
stability
is affected
by
the
bandwidth
of the
controller
and
the
(2,0)-mode
damping.
If
the
feedback
stress
is applied
in proportion
to the velocity
of the mode
amplitude
with
appropriate
sign,
the damping
of the
mode
can be increased.
Active
control
of damping
has
recently
been
demonstrated
in Plateau-tank
experiments.
The dynamic
response
of a bridge
to feedback
control
is predicted
to be significantly
different
for bridges
in air compared
to those
in a Plateau
tank
NASA/T_2002-211211
25

because
of the
different
nature
of
the
viscous
damping
for
the
two
cases.
Boundary-layer
damping
at the free interface
is much
more
important
for the case of a Plateau-tank
bridge.
Laboratory
experiments':
A new
fluid
system
is being
used
in the
Plateau-tank
facility
to
allow
for studies
of bridge
dynamics
and
active
control
of damping
with
the AES
system.
The
bath
fluid
is
a high-density
(1.61
g/cc),
low
viscosity
(0.77
cS),
low
dielectric
constant,
fluorinated
liquid
with
low
water
solubility.
The
bridge
liquid
is an aqueous
solution
of
CsC1,
density
matched
to
the
bath
(-52.3
wt%
CsC1).
The
Ohnesorge
number
(ratio
of viscous
to
inertial
effects)
for bridges
with the new fluid
system
is around
0.003
which
is close
to that
of a
pure water
bridge
in air of the same
diameter.
The new
system
is still
not
dynamically
similar
to
a bridge
in air because
the dynamics
also depend
on the density
and viscosity
ratios
between
the
inner
and
outer
fluids.
Dynamics
studies
involve
driving
the
(2,0)
mode
by
modulating
the
electrode
potentials
and
then
cutting
off
modulation
to
allow
for
a free
decay
of
the
mode.
Feedback
can be active
during
the
entire
modulation
and free-decay
sequence.
Results
obtained
with
the new
system
show
that
mode
damping
increases
in proportion
to
the
velocity
gain
as
expected.
Also,
by
using
negative
velocity
feedback,
damping
can be reduced
to the
point
that
the
bridge
spontaneously
begins
oscillating
at
the
natural
(2,0)-mode
frequency
leading
to
breakup
of the bridge.
By
using
both
amplitude
and velocity
feedback,
the
mode
frequency
can
be shifted
upward
and the damping
increased.
KC-135
based
experiments':
KC-135
experiments
performed
in 2001
concentrated
on passive
acoustic
stabilization.
Real-time
measurements
of transducer
power
consumption
and
acoustic
pressure
were
made
while
stabilizing
a bridge.
Also,
progress
was
made
on
confirming
the
theoretical
understanding
of PAS
by performing
experiments
with
different
bridge
radii
but
the
same
acoustic
wavenumber.
The
theory
predicts
optimum
stabilization
for
a particular
value
of
the
wavenumber-radius
product
(kR-0.86)
[2].
As
expected,
a
bridge
with
a
kR
value
significantly
larger
than
the predicted
optimum
could
not
be stabilized.
Because
of the
limited
duration
and quality
of low
gravity,
studies
of bridge
dynamics
on the
KC-135
using
the
AES
system
in the
manner
described
above
for the Plateau-tank
are very
difficult.
Some
oscillation
and free-decay
measurements
for a bridge
in air without
feedback
were
made
on the
KC-135
in
2000
[3].
The measured
frequency
and damping
of the mode
agreed
reasonably
well
with
theory
[3].
Active
damping
of
bridges
in air
would
be
investigated
best
on
the
ISS,
although
a
demonstration
on the KC-135
may
be possible.

ABSTRACT
Driven
by
advancements
in microelectronics
manufacturing,
this
research
investigates
the
oblique
(non-axisymmetric)
impact
of liquid-metal
droplets
on flat
substrates.
The
problem
of
interest
is
relevant
to
the
development
of
the
novel
technology
of
on-demand
dispension
(printing)
of microscopic
solder
deposits
for
the
surface
mounting
of microelectronic
devices.
The
technology,
known
as
solder
jetting,
features
on-demand
deposition
of
miniature
solder
droplets
(30
to
120gm
in
diameter)
in
very
fine,
very
accurate
patterns
using
techniques
analogous
to
those
developed
for
the
ink-jet
printing
industry.
Despite
its
promise,
severe
limitations
exist
currently
with
regards
to the throughput
rates
of the technology;
some
of these
limitations
are largely
due to the
lack
of the
capability
for reliable
prediction
of solder
bump
positioning
and shapes,
especially
under
ballistic
deposition
conditions
where
the droplet
impact
phenomena
are inherently
three-dimensional.
The
study
consists
of
a theoretical
and
an
experimental
component.
The
theoretical
work
uses
a finite
element
formulation
to
simulate
numerically
the
non-axisymmetric
(3-D)
fluid
mechanics
and heat
transfer
phenomena
of a liquid
solder
droplet
impacting
at an angle
o_ on a
flat
substrate
(Fig.
1). The
work
focuses
on the pre-solidification
regime.
The
modeling
of the
most
challenging
fluid
mechanics
part of the process
has been
completed
successfully.
It is based
upon
the full
laminar
Navier-Stokes
equations
employing
a Lagrangian
frame
of reference.
Due
to the
large
droplet
deformation,
the
surface
(skin)
as well
as the
volumetric
mesh
have
to be
regenerated
during
the
calculations
in order
to
maintain
the
high
accuracy
of
the
numerical
scheme.
The
pressure
and
velocity
fields
are then
interpolated
on the newly
created
mesh.
The
numerical
predictions
are being
tested
against
experiments,
for cases
where
wetting
phenomena
are not important.
For the impact
parameters
used
in the example
shown
in Figs
2, 3
(We = 2.38,
Fr = 16300,
Re = 157),
the
droplet
rolls
along
the
substrate,
but
its
shape
remains
practically
axisymmetric
for
all impact
angles
within
the range
from
0 to 60 deg. Figure
2 exemplifies
the
results,
showing
this
rolling
motion
at
an
impact
angle
o_=45
deg.
Interestingly,
the
substrate/droplet
contact
area
during
the
recoiling
phase
of the
impact
is not
a monotonically
decreasing
function
of time
(Fig.
3).

The
experimental
component
of
the
research
tests
the numerical
predictions
and
provides
necessary
input
data (contact
angles)
for the theoretical
model.
The experiments
are performed
in
microgravity
(2.2s
drop
tower
of the NASA
GRC)
in order
to allow
for the use of mm-size
solder
droplets,
which
make
feasible
the
performance
of
accurate
measurements,
while
maintaining
similitude
of
the
relevant
fluid
dynamic
groups
(Re,
Fr,
We, &e).
Preliminary
oblique
impact
experiments
have
been
performed
using
water
droplets
in normal
gravity.
Figure
4 shows
the
definition
of
the
two
extreme
values
of
contact
angle
(front
0v,
rear
0a),
as viewed
from
a
direction
normal
to the plane
of impact.
Figure

the measured
temporal
variations
of
these
two
angles
for
an impact
case
where
o_=27deg,
We = 11.7, Fr = 20.5
and Re = 1530.
It is
seen
that
the
oscillatory
behavior
of the
two
angles
is not
in phase,
indicating
the
complex
interaction
between
the bulk
fluid motion
and the motion
of the free surface.

ABSTRACT
In this
project
we
examine
non-coalescence
and
non-wetting
phenomena
driven
by either
thermocapillary
convection
or forced
motion
of one surface
relative
to the other.
In both
cases,
the non-coalescence
or non-wetting
is enabled
by the existence
of a lubricating
layer
of gas that
exists
to keep the two
surfaces
in question
from
coming
into contact
with one another.
Recent
progress
has been
made
on several
fronts:
1)
measurement
of the vibrational
modes
of pinned
droplets;
2) development
of an apparatus
for the measurement
of the frictional
forces
associated
with
a non-wetting
droplet
sliding
over a solid
surface;
3) measurements
of the failure
modes
for
non-wetting
droplets
and
the
influence
of
static
electric
charge
on
failure;
and
4)
numerical
simulation
of a two-dimensional
non-wetting
droplet
revealing
a possible
explanation
for why the phenomenon
has not been
able to be observed
using
water
as the droplet
liquid.
Issue
1) above
is of relevance
to the use of non-wetting
droplets
as positioning
mechanisms
and vibration
dampers
in a microgravity
environment;
issue
2) relates
to the use of non-wetting
droplets
as nearly
"frictionless"
bearings
in low-load
applications.
Understanding
of the failure
modes
identified
in 3) is of importance
to any potential
application
and the numerical
simulations
conducted
under
4)
allow
us to
obtain
information
about
these
systems
that
is currently
not
available
through
experimentation
Each
of
these
topics
will
be
discussed
briefly
during
the
presentation.

SHADOWGRAPH
STUDY
OF
GRADIENT
DRIVEN
FLUCTUATIONS

ABSTRACT
A fluid
or fluid mixture,
subjected
to a vertical
temperature
and/or
concentration
gradient
in a gravitational
field,
exhibits
greatly
enhanced
light
scattering
at small
angles
[1-3].
This
effect
is caused
by coupling
between
the vertical
velocity
fluctuations
due
to thermal
energy
and the
vertically
varying
refractive
index.
Physically,
small
upward
or downward
moving
regions
will
be
displaced
into
fluid
having
a refractive
index
different
from
that
of the moving
region,
thus
giving
rise
to the enhanced
scattering
[4].
The scattered
intensity
is predicted
[5-7] to vary
with
scattering
wave
vector
q,
as
q-4,
for
sufficiently
large
q,
but
the divergence
is quenched
by
gravity
[8] at small
q.
In the absence
of gravity,
the long wavelength
fluctuations
responsible
for
the enhanced
scattering
are predicted
to grow
until
limited
by the sample
dimensions
[9, 10].
It
is
thus
of
interest
to
measure
the
mean-squared
amplitude
of
such
fluctuations
in
the
microgravity
environment
for comparison
with
existing
theory
and ground
based
measurements.
The
relevant
wave
vectors
are
extremely
small,
making
traditional
low-angle
light
scattering
difficult
or impossible
because
of stray
elastically
scattered
light
generated
by optical
surfaces.
An
alternative
technique
is offered
by the
shadowgraph
method,
which
is normally
used
to
visualize
fluid
flows,
but
which
can
also
serve
as
a quantitative
tool
to
measure
fluctuations
[11,
12].
A somewhat
novel
shadowgraph
apparatus
and the necessary
data analysis
methods
will be
described.
The
apparatus
uses
a spatially
coherent,
but
temporally
incoherent,
light
source
consisting
of a super-luminescent
diode
coupled
to a single-mode
optical
fiber
in
order
to achieve
extremely
high
spatial
resolution,
while
avoiding
effects
caused
by interference
of light
reflected
from the various
optical
surfaces
that
are present
when
using
laser
sources.
Results
obtained
for a critical
mixture
of aniline
and cyclohexane
subjected
to a vertical
temperature
gradient
will
be
presented.
The
sample
was
confined
between
two
horizontal
parallel
sapphire
plates
with
a vertical
spacing
of 1 mm.
The temperatures
of the sapphire
plates
were
controlled
by independent
circulating
water
loops
that used
Peltier
devices
to add or remove
heat from
the room
air as required.
For
a mixture
with
a temperature
gradient,
two
effects
are
involved
in generating
the
vertical
refractive
index
gradient,
namely
thermal
expansion
and
the
Soret
effect,
which
generates
a concentration
gradient
in response
to the
applied
temperature
gradient.
For
the
aniline/cyclohexane
system,
the denser
component
(aniline)
migrates
toward
the colder
surface.
Consequently,
when
heating
from
above,
both
effects
result
in the sample
density
decreasing
with
altitude
and
are
stabilizing
in the
sense
that
no
convective
motion
occurs
regardless
of
the
magnitude
of the
applied
temperature
gradient.
The
Soret
effect
is strong
near
a binary
liquid
critical
point,
and thus
the
dominant
effect
is due
to the
induced
concentration
gradient.
The
results
clearly
show
the divergence
at low
q and the predicted
gravitational
quenching.
Results
obtained
for different
applied
temperature
gradients
at varying
temperature
differences
from
the
critical
temperature,
clearly
demonstrate
the predicted
divergence
of the thermal
diffusion
ratio.
NASA/T_2002-211211
31

Thus,
the
more
closely
the
critical
point
is approached,
the
smaller
becomes
the
temperature
gradient
required
to generate
the same
signal.
Two
different
methods
have
been
used
to generate
pure
concentration
gradients.
In the
first,
a sample
cell
was
filled
with
a single
fluid,
ethylene
glycol,
and
a denser
miscible
fluid,
water,
was
added
from
below
thus
establishing
a sharp
interface
to begin
the
experiment.
As
time
went
on
the
two
fluids
diffused
into
each
other,
and
large
amplitude
fluctuations
were
clearly
observed
at low
q.
The
effects
of gravitational
quenching
were
also
evident.
In the
second
method,
the
aniline/cyclohexane
sample
was
used,
and
after
applying
a
vertical
temperature
gradient
for several
hours,
the top
and bottom
temperatures
were
set equal
and the
thermal
gradient
died
on
a time
scale
of
seconds,
leaving
the
Soret
induced
concentration
gradient
in
place.
Again,
large-scale
fluctuations
were
observed
and
died
away
slowly
in
amplitude
as diffusion
destroyed
the initial
concentration
gradient.

INTRODUCTION
The widespread
use of electro-hydrodynamic
devices
and processes
emphasizes
a critical
need
for
developing
a comprehensive
predictive
theory capable
of improving
our fundamental
understanding
of
the behavior
of a suspension
subject to an AC electric field and shear, and of facilitating
the design
and
optimization
of such devices. The currently
favored
approach
to the qualitative
interpretation
of the AC-
field driven manipulation
of suspensions
is based on a model
which considers
only the force exerted
on
a single
particle
by an external
field and
neglects
the field-induced
and hydrodynamic
interparticle
interactions
both being
inversely
proportional
to the interparticle
distance
raised
to the power
three. On
the other hand,
the purpose
of the field-induced
separation
is to concentrate
particles
in certain
regions
of a device.
This clearly
raises the fundamental
question
regarding
the extent to wlfich we can neglect
these
slow decaying
electrical
and hydrodynamic
collective
interactions
and rely on the predictions
of a
single-particle
model.
Another
important
issue
that
still
remains
open
is how
to characterize
the
polarization
of a particle
exposed
to a strong
electric
field.
The presentation
will address
both these
questions.

The
process
was
modeled
by
computing
the
particle
motions

the
combined

dielectrophoretic,
viscous, and gravitational
forces under conditions
of negligibly
small particle
Reynolds
numbers
and neglecting
the interparticle
electric
and hydrodynamic
interactions.
The model
calculations
required
no
titling
parameters
because
the particle
polarizability
was
determined
independently
by
measuring
the frequency
and concentration
dependence
of the complex
dielectric
permittivity
of a
suspension

field (~ V/mm).
The predictions
of this single-particle
model
were found to be consistent
with the experimental

the rate

accumulation

ABSTRACT
We provide
an overview
of our research
on sheet
flows
and avalanches
of granular
materials,
primarily
in terrestrial
conditions.
Sheet
flows
are relatively
thin,
highly
concentrated
regions
of
grains
that
flow
near
the
ground
under
the influence
of a strong
turbulent
wind.
In them
grains
are
suspended
by
interparticle
collisions
and
the
velocity
fluctuations
of
the
turbulent
gas.
Avalanches
are flows
of dry,
cohesionless
granular
materials
that
are driven
by gravity
down
inclines
against
the frictional
and collisional
resistance
of the grains
of the bed.
In our
study
of sheet
flows,
we have
extended
existing
theories
that
involve
particle-particle
and gas-particle
interactions
to apply
to the conditions
of a typical
terrestrial
sand
dune
during
a
sandstorm.
This
has
involved
the incorporation
of both
the
viscous
dissipation
of the particle
fluctuation
energy
due
to the
gas
and
the
turbulent
suspension
of
the
grains
due
to velocity
fluctuations
of
the
gas.
It has
also
involved
an
examination
of
several
different
boundary
conditions
at the bed and a more
precise
characterization
of the conditions
that apply
at the top of
a sheet
flow,
where
the mean-free-path
between
collisions
becomes
comparable
to the length
of a
ballistic
trajectory.
Solutions
to the resulting
differential
equations
have
been
obtained
for both
steady
and
unsteady
fully-developed
flow.
The
latter
solutions
provide
information
on
the
characteristic
time to achieve
a steady
flow
that plays
a key role in dune
formation.
In
support
of this
modeling
effort,
experiments
have
been
undertaken
to provide
a better
understanding
of
the
interaction
of particles
colliding
with
the
bed,
and
the
energy
of
the
rebounding
particle
and
additional
ejected
particles
has
been
measured
in
two-dimensional
situations.
The research
on avalanches
has focused
on dense,
frictional
flows.
Experiment
and numerical
simulations
indicate
that relatively
thin dense
flows,
on the order
of ten particle
diameters,
occur
in
layers.
In
these,
momentum
transfer
occurs
by
rubbing
between
contacting
particles
and
bumping
between
particles
falling
under
gravity,
rather
than
in collisions
between
freely
flying
particles.
Thicker
dense
flows,
on the
other
hand,
do
seem
to involve
collisional
transfer
of
momentum.
Theories
based
on
the
appropriated
mechanisms
of
momentum
transfer
predict
velocity
profiles
that
are
in
agreement
with
those
measured
in
experiment
and
numerical
simulations,
some
of which
have been
carried
out in the course
of the research.

The gravity-driven
flow
of non-neutrally
buoyant
suspensions
is shown
to be unstable
to
spanwise
perturbations
when
the shearing
motion
generates
a density
profile
that
increases
with height.
The instability
is simply
due to having
heavier
material
over light.
The wavelength
of the perturbation
is found
to be on the order
of the thickness
of the
suspension
layer.
The parameters
important
to the problem
are the angle
of inclination
of
the layer
relative
to gravity,
the relative
density
difference
between
the particles
and
fluid,
the ratio
of the particle
size to the suspension
layer,
and the bulk volume
fraction
of
particles.

ABSTRACT
Objects
in plasma,
such
as planetary
bodies
in the solar
wind,
charge
to a floating
potential
determined
by the balance
between
charging
currents
in the local
plasma
environment.
In cases
where
secondary
electron
emission
and photoemission
are weak,
objects
will become
negatively
charged
due to electron
collection
and will
be surrounded
by a plasma
sheath.
Solar
ultraviolet
radiation
can produce
a photoelectron
sheath
above
the sunlit
surface
of airless
planetary
bodies.
In both
cases
an electric
field
is present
near
the surface
that
can accelerate
charged
dust particles
near
the
surface.
Dust
may
be
stably
levitated
if the
electric
force
balances
the
gravitational
force.

1: (a) Surveyor

horizon

the

and

[1]. (b) Voyager
2 image
of Saturn's
rings.
The
dark
smudges
are "spokes"
of dust particles
lifted
off the surface
of the larger
ring particles
by electrostatic
forces
[2].
Experiments
in a plasma
sheath
have
shown
that particles
can be stably
levitated
with
surface
potentials
consistent
with
those
expected
on planetary
surfaces
[3].
Our
experiments
have
also
shown
that
particles
can
be
lifted
off
the
surface
by the
electric
field
without
any
additional
disturbance.
This
may
explain
the
separation
of
dust
from
the
surfaces
of
larger
particles
in
Saturn's
rings
observed
as "spokes"
by local
plasma
presumably
generated
by an impact
(Figure
1). Observations
of smooth
deposits
of regolith
in crater
bottoms
on the asteroid
433 Eros
by the
NEAR
spacecraft
suggest
a transport
mechanism
for regolith
[4]. Levitation
of charged
dust and
transport
in an
inhomogeneous
electric
field
is a possible
explanation
for
the
distribution
of
regolith
on Eros
and
other
asteroids.
More
generally,
acceleration
of charged
dust
in the
near-
surface
sheath
can
lead
to loss
of fine-grained
particles
from
objects
with
weak
gravitational
accelerations.
We have
carried
out experiments
on charging,
levitation,
and transport
of dust in plasma
and
photoelectron
sheaths.
A
tungsten
filament
beneath
the
surface
plate
creates
the
primary
electrons
that
ionize
gas in the chamber.
When
the surface
is biased
to a sufficiently
high voltage
NASA/T_2002-211211
41

(-40V
to -80V),
dust
particles
are lifted
off the surface.
Some
of these
particles,
depending
on
size
and mass,
become
stably
levitated
a few
cm above
the surface
[3].
On objects
with
weaker
surface
gravity
the particle
size-dependent
levitation
height
is higher.
In
addition
to
levitation
our
experimental
studies
show
that
dust
can
be
transported
horizontally
over
a uniform
surface
in a uniform
plasma
sheath.
We
conducted
experiments
where
a surface
is partially
covered
by dust
grains
and partially
clean.
After
cycling
the plasma
on and
off,
net transport
of
dust
to the
initially
dust-free
portions
of the
surface
is observed.
Further
experiments
will
include
topographical
features
on the
surface
simulating
craters
and
rocks,
and we will
quantify
the horizontal
transport
of dust
in the sheath
as a function
of grain
properties
and plasma
properties.
Simple
numerical
simulations
also
show
a net transport
of dust when
inhomogeneities
in the
sheath
are introduced.
We
calculate
the trajectories
of individual
dust
grains
using
a numerical
integrator
that
simultaneously
solves
for the charge
on the particle.
The forces
on the particle
are
gravity
downward
and
the
electric
force
resulting
from
the grain
charge
and the
electric
field
normal
to the
model
surface
that
is produced
by the
sheath.
Although
there
are no horizontal
forces
in our initial
simulations,
horizontal
transport
occurs
as a result
of a combination
of initial
horizontal
velocity
components
for
dust
lifted
off the
surface,
the
effects
of topography,
and
discontinuities
in the photoelectron
sheath
at the terminator.
When
dust
particles
enter
shadow
the sheath
vanishes
in this model,
and the particle
falls
to the surface
under
the effects
of gravity.
In our simulations
this leads
to an accumulation
of dust at the terminator.
Dust
also
accumulates
at the borders
of topographical
features
such
as blocks
and craters
(Figure
3).

Particles

side
of
the crater
are edge
effects
of the simulation.
More
realistic
modeling
of the sheath
and the surface
at these

are planned,
but the
basic
phenomenon
of dust accumulation
at shadow
and topographical
boundaries
should
persist.

A
dense
pack
of
solid
particles
can
be
fluidized
by
an
upward
flow
of
liquid,
which
counterbalances
the
gravitational
force
on the
particles.
The
resulting
suspension
is stable
for
sufficiently
small
fluid
velocities,
although
the particle
dynamics
are
complex
and
still
not
fully
understood.
A packed
particle
bed
can also
be fluidized
by a gas flow,
but
in this case
a stable
suspension
of moving
particles
cannot
be produced
in earth's
gravitational
field.
Kinetic
theory
of
gas-fluidized
beds
predicts
that
the bed
is always
unstable
to particle
inertia,
whichis
several
orders
of magnitude
larger
than
fluid
inertia
in this
case.
In order
to study
the
onset
of this
particle-induced
instability,
the minimum
fluidization
velocity
must
be reduced
by several
orders
of magnitude;
we
believe
that
this
can
be most
successfully
accomplished
in a reduced
gravity
environment.
We
expect
that
in a microgravity
environment
it would
be possible
to explore
the
transition
between
stable
and
unstable
flow
regimes
in
gas-fluidized
beds,
and
contrast
the
behavior
of particle
inertia
(gas-fluidized)
and
fluid
inertia
(liquid
fluidized)
driven
instabilities.
However
in this
preliminary
study
the
investigations
of
gas-fluidized
systems
will
be
done
numerically.
We will
compare
and contrast
the stability
conditions
and flow
patterns
arising
from
increasing
fluid
inertia
(Re
>
1, St
~ Re)
and
increasing
particle-inertia
(Re
<
1, St
>
1).
Laboratory
experiments
on liquid-fluidized
beds
are being
used
to validate
the predictions
of the
numerical
simulations.
In this
talk
I will
summarize
results
from
computer
simulations
of particles
settling
in a low-
Reynolds
number
regime.
Experimental
measurements
of
the
velocity
fluctuations
in
a
sedimenting
suspension
[1,
2]
are
independent
of
system
size
for
sufficiently
large
containers.
However,
this observation
is at odds
with
theoretical
[3] and
numerical
[4, 5] predictions
for
a
random
distribution
of particles.
I will
present
new
data
for
suspensions
bounded
by
a rigid
container,
and
compare
them
with
results
for homogeneous
suspensions
with
periodic
boundary
conditions.
Velocity
fluctuations
in verticallyinhomogeneous
suspensions
are found
to saturate
under
conditions
similar
to
those
found
in
laboratory
experiments,
while
in
vertically
homogeneous
suspensions
the velocity
fluctuations
diverge
with
increasing
container
dimension
(Fig.
1) [6].
The
strikingly
different
behavior
in the velocity
fluctuations
for the different
boundary
conditions
is
caused
by
the
interfaces
between
the
dense
pack,
the
homogenous
suspension,
and
the
supematent
fluid.
These
interfaces
are a sink
for the fluctuation
energy,
which
drains
out of the
system
at
a rate
that
is roughly
proportional
to the inverse
of the
cell
height.
Random
density
fluctuations
convect
to one of these
two
interfaces
and are absorbed
by the density
gradient
at the
interface.
A scaling
argument
suggests
that convection

recall
that
in the absence
of a gas, individual
impacts
are so fast that the only time
scale
governing
the granular
phase
is the inverse
of 5', the shear
rate imposed
by the moving
boundaries.
At small
particle
Reynolds
numbers,
the
gas
introduces
an
additional
viscous
relaxation
time
0s = Ps d2/18_tg,
where
Ps, d and
_tg are,
respectively,
the density
of the spheres,
their
diameter
and the gas viscosity.
In simple
shear
flows,
Sangani
et al. (1996)
calculated
values
of the limiting
Stokes
number
St = 5' 0s at which
the particle
fluctuation
energy
is equally
dissipated
by viscous
and collisional
interactions.
Far above
this limit,
the shear
rate is sufficient
to ignore
the viscous
drag on the spheres.
In
contrast,
for
these
Viscous
Dissipation
Experiments,
our
intention
is
to
reduce
the
boundary
speed
in successive
tests
until
the Stokes
number
becomes
small
enough
for the gas to
affect
the balance
of fluctuation
energy
of the spheres.
We will
control
the magnitude
of the
particle
Reynolds
number
by adjusting
the
absolute
pressure
in the cell.
At sufficiently
low
Stokes
number,
Sangani
et al. (1996)
showed
that
the
granular
fluctuation
velocity
scales
as
/5'd _: St/Rdiss,
where
Rdiss(V)
is
a coefficient
characterizing
viscous
dissipation.
In
our
experiments,
we will
infer
Rdiss by recording
transverse
profiles
of
granular
temperature
and
comparing
these
with theoretical
predictions.
The measurements
will
be accomplished
by observing
the
flow
through
side
walls
and by
using
computer
vision
techniques
to
record
transverse
profiles
of
the
mean
and
fluctuation
velocities
of the solids.
In order
to evaluate
the role
of non-continuum
lubrication,
we will
also
reduce
the pressure
of the apparatus
and measure
Rdiss at increasing
values
of the molecular
mean
free
path.
Finally,
we will
perform
experiments
at Stokes
and Reynolds
numbers
where
the
present
theory
is valid
and also,
in an effort to inform
future
theoretical
work,
at values
when
it is
not.
In the second
series
of experiments,
we will
impose
a gas pressure
gradient
on the shearing
cell.
The gradient
will
induce
a relative
velocity
between
the two phases,
while
the shearing
will
set independently
the agitation
of the solids.
These
Viscous
Drag
Experiments
will be unique
in
exploring
a regime
where
particle
velocity
fluctuations
are determined
by a mechanism
other
than
interactions
with the gas.
In this
regime,
we will measure
the dependence
of Rdiss and the drag
coefficient
edrag
on the solid
volume
fraction.
We
will
do so by recording
the
following
variables
and
comparing
these
with
theoretical
predictions:
mean
gas volume
flow
rate through
the flow
channel,
pressure
gradient
in the gas and
transverse
profiles
of mean
granular
velocity,
granular
temperature
and
volume
fraction.
By
reducing
the pressure
of the cell,
we will
also
record
the effects
of particle
Reynolds
number
on
edrag.
Finally,
we will
record
the cross-sectional
mean
solid
volume
fraction
at several
positions
along
the
channel.
This
will
permit
us to monitor
the flow
development
and the approach
to
steady-state,
and it will contribute
to measuring
the required
volume
flow
rate
of gas through
all
branches
of the flow
channel.

ABSTRACT
This
work
focuses
on
the
properties
of sheared
granular
materials
near
the
jamming
transition.
The
project
currently
involves
two
aspects.
The
first
of these
is an
experiment
that
is a prototype
for
a planned
ISS
flight.
The
second
is discrete
element
simulations
(DES)
that
can
give insight
into
the
behavior
one
might
expect
in a reduced-g
environment.
The
experimental
arrangement
consists
of an
annular
channel
that
contains
the
granular
material.
One
surface,
say the
upper
surface,
rotates
so as to shear
the
material
contained
in
the annulus.
The
lower
surface
controls
the mean
density/mean
stress
on the sample
through
an
actuator
or
other
control
system.
A
novel
feature
under
development
is the
ability
to
'thermalize'
the
layer-i.e,
create
a larger
amount
of random
motion
in the
material,
by using
tile
actuating
system
to provide
vibrations
as well
control
the
mean
volume
of the
annulus.
The
stress
states
of the
system
are
determined
by
transducers
on
the
non-rotating
wall.
These
measure
both
shear
and
normal
components
of the
stress
on
different
size
scales.
Here,
the
idea
is to characterize
the
system
as the
density
varies
through
values
spanning
dense
almost
solid
to relatively
mobile
granular
states.
This
transition
regime
encompasses
the
regime
usually
thought
of as the
glass
transition,
and/or
the jamming
transition.
Motivation
for this
experiment
springs
from
ideas
of a granular
glass
transition,
a related
jamming
transition,
and
from
recent
experiments.
In particular,
we note
recent
experiments
carried
out
by our group
to characterize
this
type
of transition
(Howell
et al.
Phys.
Rev.
Lett.
82,
5241
(1999))
and
also
to demonstrate/characterize
fluctuations
in slowly
sheared
systems
(Miller
et
al.
Phys.
Rev.
Lett.
77,
3110
(1996)).
These
experiments
give
key
insights
into
what
one
might
expect
in near-zero
g.
In
particular,
they
show
that
the
compressibility
of granular
systems
diverges
at
a transition
or critical
point.
It
is this
divergence,
coupled
to gravity,
that
makes
it extremely
difficult
if not
impossible
to characterize
the
transition
region
in an
earth-bound
experiment.
In
the
DE
modeling,
we
analyze
dynamics
of
a sheared
granular
system
in
Couette
geometry
in two
(2D)
and
three
(3D)
space
dimensions.
Here,
the
idea
is to both
better
understand
v_hat
we might
encounter
in a reduced-g
environment,
and
at
a deeper
level
to
deduce
the
physics
of sheared
systems
in a density
regime
that
has
not
been
addressed
by
past
experiments
or simulations.
One
aspect
of the simulations
addresses
sheared
2D system
in zero-g
environment.
For low
volume
fractions,
the
expected
dynamics
of this
type
of system
is relatively
well understood.
However,
as the
volume
fraction
is increased,
the
system
undergoes
a phase
transition,
as
explained
above.
The
DES
concentrate
on the
evolution
of the
system
as the
solid
volume
fraction
is slowly
increased,
and
in particular
on the
behavior
of very
dense
systems.
For
these
configurations,
the
simulations
show
that
polydispersity
of the
sheared
particles
is a
crucial
factor
that
determines
the
system
response.
Figures
1 and
2 below,
that
present
the
total
force
on each
grain,
show
that
even
relatively
small
(10 %)
nonuniformity

of the grains(expectedin typical experiments)may leadto significantmodificationsof the

ABSTRACT
Experiments
have
been
performed
t_ study
the
average
flow
properties
of
inertially
dominated
bubbly
liquids
which
may
be
described
by
a novel
analysis.
Bubbles
with
high
Reynolds
number
and
low
Weber
number
may
produce
a fluid
velocity
disturbance
that
can be
approximated
by a potential
flow.
We
studied
the behavior
of suspensions
of bubbles
of about
1.5 nun
diameter
in vertical
and inclined
channels.
The
suspension
was produced
using
a bank
of
900
glass
capillaries
with
inner
diameter
of
about
100 I.tm in a quasi-steady
fashion.
In
addition,
salt
was added
to the suspension
to prevent
bubble-bubble
coalescence.
As a result,
a
nearly
monodisperse
suspension
of bubble
was
produced.
By
increasing
the inclination
angle,
we
were
able
to
explore
an
increasing
amount
of
shear
to
buoyancy
motion.
A
pipe
flow
experiment
with
the
liquid
beingrecirculated
is under
construction.
This
will
provide
an even
larger
range
of shear
to buoyancy
motion.
We
are planning
a microgravity
experiment
in which
a bubble
suspension
is subjected
to shearing
in acouette
cell in the absence
of a buoyancy-driven
relative
motion
of the two phases.
By
employing
a single-wire,
hot
film
anemometer,
we
were
able
to
obtain
the
liquid
velocity
fluctuations.
The
shear
stress
at the
wall
was
measured
using
a hot
film
probe
flush
mounted
on the wall.
The
gas volume
fraction,
bubble
velocity,
and bubble
velocity
fluctuations
were
measured
using
a homemade,
dual
impedance
probe.
In addition,
we also employed
a high-
speed
camera
to obtain
the bubble
size distribution
and bubble
shape
in a dilute
suspension.
A rapid
decrease
in bubble
velocity
for
a dilute
bubble
suspension
is attributed
to the
effects
of bubble-wall
collisions.
The more
gradual
decrease
of bubble
velocity
as gas volume
fraction
increases,
due
to subsequent
hindering
of bubble
motion,
is in
qualitative
agreement
with
the predictions
of Spelt
and Sangani
(1998)
for the effects
of potential-flow
bubble-bubble
interactions
on the mean
velocity.
The ratio
of the bubble
velocity
variance
to the square
of the
mean
is O(0.1).
For
these
conditions
Spelt
and
Sangani
predicted
that
the
homogeneous
suspension
would
be unstable
and clustering
into
horizontal
rafts
will
take
place.
Evidence
for
bubble
clustering
is obtained
by analysis
of video
images.
The
liquid
velocity
variance
is larger
than
would
be
expected
for
a homogeneous
suspension
and
the
liquid
velocity
frequency
spectrum
indicates
the presence
of velocity
fluctuations
that are slow compared
with the time
for
the passage
of an
individual
bubble.
These
observations
provide
further
evidence
for
bubble
clustering.

ABSTRACT
This
research
addresses
turbulent
gas flows
laden
with
fine
solid
particles
at sufficiently
large
mass
loading
that
strong
two-way
coupling
occurs.
By two-way
coupling
we mean
that
the
particle
motion
is governed
largely
by the flow,
while
the
particles
affect
the gas-phase
mean
flow
and the turbulence
properties.
Our main
interest
is in understanding
how
the particles
affect
the
turbulence.
Computational
techniques
have
been
developed
which
can
accurately
predict
flows
carrying
particles
that
are
much
smaller
than
the
smallest
scales
of
turbulence.
Also,
advanced
computational
techniques
and burgeoning
computer
resources
make
it feasible
to fully
resolve
very
large
particles
moving
through
turbulent
flows.
However,
flows
with
particle
diameters
of the same
order
as the Kolmogorov
scale
of the turbulence
are notoriously
difficult
to
predict.
Some
simple
flows
show
strong
turbulence
attenuation
with
reductions
in the turbulent
kinetic
energy
by up to a factor
of five.
On the other
hand,
some
seemingly
similar
flows
show
almost
no modification.
No model
has been
proposed
that
allows
prediction
of when
the strong
attenuation
will
occur.
Unfortunately,
many
technological
and natural
two-phase
flows
fall into
this regime,
so there
is a strong
need
for new physical
understanding
and modeling
capability.
Our
objective
is
to
study
the
simplest
possible
turbulent
particle-laden
flow,
namely
homogeneous,
isotropic
turbulence
with
a uniform
dispersion
of
monodisperse
particles.
We
chose
such
a simple
flow
for two reasons.
First,
the simplicity
allows
us to probe
the interaction
in more
detail
and
offers
analytical
simplicity
in interpreting
the results.
Secondly,
this
flow
can
be
addressed
by
numerical
simulation,
and
many
research
groups
are
already
working
on
calculating
the
flow.
Our
detailed
data
can
help
guide
some
of
these
efforts.
By
using
microgravity,
we
can
further
simplify
the
flow
to the case
of
no mean
velocity
for
either
the
turbulence
or the particles.
In fact
the addition
of gravity
as a variable
parameter
may
help
us to
better
understand
the physics
of turbulence
attenuation.
The
experiments
are conducted
in a turbulence
chamber
capable
of producing
stationary
or
decaying
isotropic
turbulence
with
nearly
zero
mean
flow
and
Taylor
microscale
Reynolds
numbers
up to nearly
500.
The chamber
is a 410 mm
cubic
box
with
the corners
cut off to make
it approximately
spherical.
Synthetic
jet turbulence
generators
are mounted
in each
of the eight
corners
or the box.
Each
generator
consists
of a loudspeaker
forcing
a plenum
and
producing
a
pulsed
jet through
a 20 mm
diameter
orifice.
These
synthetic
jets
are directed
into
ejector
tubes
pointing
towards
the chamber
center.
The
ejector
tubes
increase
the jet mass
flow
and decrease
the
velocity.
The
jets
then
pass
through
a turbulence
grid.
Each
of the
eight
loudspeakers
is
NASA/TM_002-211211
53

forced
with
a random
phase
and
frequency.
The
resulting
turbulence
is highly
isotropic
and
matches
typical
behavior
of grid turbulence.
Measurements
of both
phases
are acquired
using
particle
image
velocimetry
(PIV).
The
gas
is seeded
with
approximately
1 micron
diameter
seeding
particles
while
the
solid
phase
is
typically
150 micron
diameter
spherical
glass
particles.
A double-pulsed
YAG
laser
and a Kodak
ES-1.0
10-bit
PIV
camera
provide
the
PIV
images.
Custom
software
is used
to
separate
the
images
into
individual
images
containing
either
gas-phase
tracers
or
large
particles.
Modem
high-resolution
PIV
algorithms
are then
used
to calculate
the velocity
field.
A large
set of image
pairs
are
acquired
for
each
case,
then
the
results
are
averaged
both
spatially
and
over
the
ensemble
of acquired
images.
The
entire
apparatus
is mounted
in two
racks
which
are carried
aboard
NASA's
KC-135
Flying
Microgravity
Laboratory.
The rack
containing
the turbulence
chamber,
the laser
head,
and
the
camera
floats
freely
in the
airplane
cabin
(constrained
by competent
NASA
personnel)
to
minimize
g-jitter.
The
floating
rack
with
safety
covers
removed
is shown
in Figure
1.
In a
typical
day of flying,
we obtain
quality
data
during
about
20 of the 40 parabolas
flown.
Prior
to
taking
off, a measured
quantity
of solid
particles
are loaded
into the turbulence
chamber.
During
the course
of the experiments,
there
is attrition
as particles
become
stuck
in the comers
of the box
and in the synthetic
jet actuators.
For this reason,
the particle
mass
loading
for each
image
pair is
calculated
by the number
of particles
captured
in the images.
This
increases
the
uncertainty
in
the particle
loading.
We are presently
doing
calibrations
to reduce
this
uncertainty.
Results
for
150 micron
diameter
particles
are shown
in Figure
2.
The
turbulent
kinetic
energy
is
reduced
by

ABSTRACT
The overall
objective
of this work is to study
nucleate
boiling
heat transfer
under
microgravity
conditions
in
such
a way
that
while
providing
basic
knowledge
of
the
phenomena,
it also leads
to development
of simulation
models
ad correlations
that can be
used
as design
tools
for a wide
range
of gravity
levels.
In the study
a building
block
type
of
approach
is
used
and
both
pool
and
low
velocity
flow
boiling
are
investigated.
Starting
with
experiments
using
a single
bubble,
the
complexity
of the
experiments
is
increased
to two
or three
inline
bubbles,
to five
bubbles
placed
on a two-dimensional
grid.
Finally,
experiments
are
conducted
where
a large
number
of
prescribed
cavities
nucleate
on the heater
and when
a commercial
surface
is used.
So far experiments
have
been
conducted
at earth
normal
gravity
and in the reduced
gravity
environment
of the
KC-135
aircraft
whereas
experiments
on
the
space
station
are
planned.
Modeling/complete
numerical
simulation
of the boiling
process
is an integral
part
of the
total
effort.
Experiments
conducted
with
single
bubbles
formed
on
a
nucleation
site
microfabricated
on a polished
silicon
wafer
show
that
for gravity
levels
(g) varying
from
1.5go to 0.01go,
the bubble
diameter
at departure
varies
approximately
as (go/g)l/2
and the
growth
period
as
(go/g).
When
bubbles
merge
either
inline
or
in a plane,
the
bubble
diameter
at departure
is found
to be smaller
than
that
obtained
for
a single
bubble
and
shows
a weaker
dependence
on the
level
of gravity.
The
possible
reason
is that
as the
bubbles
merge
they
create
fluid
circulation
around
the bubbles,
which
in turn
induces
a
lift force
that
is responsible
for the
earlier
departure
of the bubbles.
The
verification
of
this
proposition
is being
sought
through
numerical
simulations.
Figures
la,
lb,
and
lc,
respectively
show
the merger
of two inline,
three
inline,
and several
bubbles
in a plane
in
the low gravity
environment
of the KC-135
aircraft.
After
merger
and before
departure,
a
mushroom
type
of bubble
with
several
stems
attached
to the
heater
surface
is clearly
evident.
Local
heat
fluxes
during
growth
and
departure
of
a single
bubble
were
also
measured.
It was
found
that
during
most
of the
growth
period
of the bubble,
generally
the wall
heat flux
decreased
with time because
of the increased
dry area under
the bubble.
However,
the heat
flux
increased
rapidly
just
prior
to departure
of the bubble
because
of
the
transient
conduction
into
the
cold
liquid
rushing
to fill
the
space
vacated
by
the
NASA/T_2002-211211
55

bubble
as the bubble
base
shrinks.
The
measured
heat
fluxes
at various
radial
locations
are found
to be in qualitative
agreement
with the numerical
predictions.
Single
bubble
studies
at
earth
normal
gravity
have
also
been
performed
on
surfaces
oriented
at different
angles
to the gravitational
acceleration
with
flow
parallel
to
the surface.
It is found
that
in all cases
the bubbles
slide
along
the surface
before
lift-off
from
the surface.
The
lift force
generated
as a result
of the relative
motion
between
the
sliding
bubbles
and the imposed
flow
is found
to play
an important
role when
the normal
force
due to buoyancy
is reduced.
An experimental
apparatus
for the study
of the bubble
behavior
with
imposed
flow
under
reduced
gravity
conditions
has been
developed
and
will soon be employed
for experiments
in the KC-135
aircraft.

The bubble
coalescence
and interfacial
instabilities
that
are important
to modeling
critical
heat
flux
(CHF)
in reduced-gravity
systems
can
be
sensitive
to even
minute
body
forces.
Understanding
these
complex
phenomena
is vital
to the design
and
safe implementation
of two-
phase
thermal
management
loops
proposed
for
space
and
planetary-based
thermal
systems.
While
reduced
gravity
conditions
cannot
be
accurately
simulated
in
lg
ground-based
experiments,
such
experiments
can
help
isolate
the
effects
of the
various
forces
(body
force,
surface
tension
force
and inertia)
which
influence
flow
boiling
CHF.
In this project,
the effects
of the component
of body
force
perpendicular
to a heated
wall
were
examined
by conducting
lg
flow
boiling
experiments
at different
orientations.
FC-72
liquid
was boiled
along
one wall
of a
transparent
rectangular
flow
channel
that
permitted
photographic
study
of the
vapor-liquid
interface
at conditions
approaching
CHF.
High-speed
video
imaging
was employed
to capture
dominant
CHF
mechanisms.
Six different
CHF
regimes
were
identified:
Wavy
Vapor
Layer,
Pool
Boiling,
Stratification,
Vapor
Counterflow,
Vapor
Stagnation,
and
Separated
Concurrent
Vapor
Flow.
CHF
showed
great
sensitivity
to orientation
for
flow
velocities
below
0.2 m/s,
where
very
small
CHF
values
where
measured,
especially
with
downflow
and downward-facing
heated
wall
orientations.
High
flow
velocities
dampened
the effects
of orientation
considerably.
Figure
1 shows
representative
images
for the different
CHF
regimes.
The
Wavy
Vapor
Layer
regime
was
dominant
for
all
high
velocities
and
most
orientations,
while
all other
regimes
were
encountered
at low
velocities,
in the downflow
and/or
downward-facing
heated
wall
orientations.
The
Interfacial
Lift-off
model
was
modified
to
predict
the
effects
of orientation
on CHF
for the
dominant
Wavy
Vapor
Layer
regime.
The
photographic
study
captured
a fairly
continuous
wavy
vapor
layer
travelling
along
the
heated
wall
while
permitting
liquid
contact
only
in wetting
fronts,
located
in the
troughs
of
the
interfacial
waves.
CHF
commenced
when
wetting
fronts
near
the outlet
were
lifted
off the wall.
The
Interfacial
Lift-off
model
is shown
to an
effective
tool
for predicting
the effects
of body
force
on CHF
at high velocities.

ABSTRACT
Boiling
is a complex
phenomenon
where
hydrodynamics,
heat
transfer,
mass
transfer,
and
interfacial
phenomena
are tightly
interwoven.
An understanding
of boiling
and critical
heat
flux in
microgravity
environments
is of importance
to space
based
hardware
and processes
such
as heat
exchange,
cryogenic
fuel
storage
and transportation,
electronic
cooling,
and
material
processing
due to the large
amounts
of heat that
can be removed
with relatively
little
increase
in temperature.
Although
research
in this
area has
been
performed
in the past
four
decades,
the mechanisms
by
which
heat is removed
from
surfaces
in microgravity
are still unclear.
In earth
gravity,
buoyancy
is an important
parameter
that
affects
boiling
heat transfer
through
the rate
at which
bubbles
are
removed
from
the surface.
A simple
model
describing
the bubble
departure
size based
on a quasi-
static
force
balance
between
buoyancy
and surface
tension
is given
by the Fritz
[1] relation:
Bo 1/2= 0.0208 0
where
Bo is the ratio
between
buoyancy
and surface
tension
forces.
For
small,
rapidly
growing
bubbles,
inertia
associated
with
the
induced
liquid
motion
can
also
cause
bubble
departure.
In
microgravity,
the magnitude
of effects
related
to natural
convection
and buoyancy
are small
and
physical
mechanisms
normally
masked
by natural
convection
in earth
gravity
such
as Marangoni
convection
can substantially
influence
the boiling
and vapor
bubble
dynamics.
CHF
is also
substantially
affected
by microgravity.
In 1-g environments,
Bo has been
used
as
a correlating
parameter
for
CHF.
Zuber's
[2]
CHF
model
for
an
infinite
horizontal
surface
assumes
that
vapor
columns
formed
by
the
merger
of
bubbles
become
unstable
due
to
a
Helmholtz
instability
blocking
the supply
of liquid
to the
surface.
The jets
are spaced
?_D apart,
where
1/2
Zz_= 2_",/5/
e _a_
,/
= 2sr.,,/-3LBo1/2
= "_'c
F
Lg_p, - p_)1
and is the wavelength
that amplifies
most
rapidly.
The
critical
wavelength,
kc, is the wavelength
below
which
a vapor
layer
underneath
a liquid
layer
is stable.
For
heaters
with
Bo smaller
than
about
3 (heaters
smaller
than
?_D), the above
model
is not
applicable,
and surface
tension
effects
dominate.
Bubble
coalescence
is thought
to be the mechanism
for CHF
under
these
conditions.
Small
Bo can result
by decreasing
the size
of
a heater
in earth
gravity,
or by
operating
a large
heater
in a lower
gravity
environment.
In the microgravity
of space,
even
large heaters
can have
NASA/T_2002-211211
59

low Bo,
and models
based
on Helmholtz
instability
should
not
be
applicable.
The
macrolayer
model
of Haramura
and Katto
[3] is dimensionally
equivalent
to Zuber's
model
and has the
same
dependence
on gravity,
so it should
not
be
applicable
as well.
The
goal
of
this
work
is
to
determine
how boiling
heat transfer
mechanisms
in a low-g
environment
are altered
from
those
at
higher
gravity
levels.
Boiling
data
using
a microheater
array
was
obtained
under
gravity
environments
ranging
from
1.8 g to 0.02
g with heater
sizes
ranging
from
2.7 mm to 1 mm.
The boiling
behavior
for 2.7
mm at 0.02
g looked
quite
similar
to boiling
on the
1 mm heater
at 1 g the formation
of a large
primary
bubble
surrounded
by smaller
satellite
bubbles
was observed
under
both
conditions.
The
similarity
suggests
that
for
heaters
smaller
than
some
fraction
of
lc,
coalescence
and
surface
tension
dominate
boiling
heat
transfer.
It also
suggests
that
microgravity
boiling
can be
studied
by studying
boiling
on very
small
heaters.

A

The concept
of the total

which
can be obtained
directly
by

was introduced.
Experimentally
measured

are in good

results.
For microgravity

an

which
reveals

was derived.

ABSTRACT
Human
Exploration
and Development
of Space
will
require
the use
of fundamental
process
technologies
for gas storage
and separation.
These
are enabling
technologies.
In our research,
we
are designing,
constructing,
and testing
an innovative,
robust,
low
mass,
low
power
separation
device
that
can
recover
carbon
dioxide
and
carbon
monoxide
for
Mars
ISRU
(in-situ

The
work
has
broad
implications
for
gas
storage
and
separations
for
gas-solid
systems;
these
are
ideally
suited
for
reduced
gravitational
environments.
The
work
is
also
important
for robotic
sample
return
missions
using
ISRU
and in lunar
oxygen
production
from
regolith
using
carbothermal
reduction.
This
paper
describes
our overall
effort
and highlights
our
results
on adsorption
equilibrium
determination
and process
design.
A second
paper
will provide
details
on adsorption

and adsorbent

transitions
and exist
in a liquid
or a
crystalline
state.
Recently,
a number
of colloidal
plasma
experiments,
in laboratory
as
well
as under
microgravity
conditions,
have
shown
the spontaneous
development
of
voids.
A void is typically
a small
and stable
centimeter-size
region
(within
the plasma)
that is completely
free of dust particles
and characterized
by sharp
boundaries.
In the
laboratory,
the void is seen to develop
from
a uniform
dust cloud
as a consequence
of an
instability
when
the dust particle
has grown
to a sufficient
size.
The instability
is first
seen
as a so-called
filamentary
mode,
which
exhibits
a sudden
onset.
The filaments
take
the form
of beam-like
striations
in the dust
density
and glow.
The spectrum
of the
filamentary
mode
is observed
to be broadband,
with
a peak at about
100 Hz.
After
onset,
the filaments
are seen to evolve
rapidly
(in about
10 ms) to a nonlinear
saturated
state
containing
a single
void.
Theoretical
analyses
have
confirmed
that the ion drag force
plays
a crucial
role in
causing
the initial
instability.
These
analyses
fall into two types:
linear
stability
analyses
that
include
the effect
of ion drag,
and nonlinear
but steady-state
analyses
that
yield
void
solutions.
As yet, there
appears
to be no nonlinear
time-dependent
model
that
describes
the
spontaneous
development
of the
linear
instability
and
its subsequent
saturation
to
produce
a void.
In this paper
we propose
a basic,
time-dependent,
self-consistent
nonlinear
model
for void
formation
in a dusty
plasma.
This
basic
model
contains
three
elements:
(a) an
initial
instability
caused
by the
ion
drag,
(b)
a nonlinear
saturation
mechanism
for
the
instability,
and
(c)
the
void
as
one
of
the
possible
nonlinearly
saturated
states,
dynamically
accessible
from
the initially
unstable
equilibrium.
For
the initial
instability
we
consider
a simple
variant
of a zero-frequency
mode,
caused
by the
ion
drag
The
saturation
mechanism
we adopt
is relevant
for collisional
voids
where
ions
achieve
near-
thermal
velocities
in the void
region.
In this regime,
the ion drag force
initially
increases
with
the ion fluid
velocity,
attains
a maximum
when
the ion fluid velocity
equals
the ion
thermal
velocity,
and
decreases
when
the
ion
fluid
velocity
exceeds
the
ion
thermal
velocity.
As the linear
instability
grows,
the ions
are initially
accelerated
in the growing
electric
field,
and
the
ion
drag
force
initially
increases.
Eventually,
as the
ions
are
accelerated
to speeds
larger
than
the ion thermal
speed,
the ion
drag
force
decreases
to
balance
the
electric
field
and thus
saturate
the instability.
We
demonstrate
by analysis
and numerical
simulation
that in the saturated
state,
a stable
void is formed.

It
has
long
been
recognized
that
heavy
particles
in the
micron
size
range
embedded
in
a turbulent
flow
field
are
thrown
out
of regions
of high
vorticity
and
collect
in regions
of
high
strain.
This
particle
clustering
has
a profound
eflbct
on processes
such
as
collision,
coalescence
and
evaporation/condensation.
For
example,
recent
work
in the
meteorology
community
suggests
this
eflbct
may
play
an important
role in the
evolution
of droplet
nuclei
in cumulus
clouds.
A recent
study
by Reade
& Collins
(2000)
showed
that
the
tendency
of
particles
to cluster
continues
down
to length
scales
much
smaller
than
the
Kolmogorov
scale.
Indeed,
the
particle
pair
correlation
function
was
shown
to increase
as a power
law
of the
inverse
of the
particle
pair
separation
distance
indefinitely
(or at least
until
the finite
particle
size cuts
it off).
The
traditional
explanation
of particle
clustering
based
on the
_centrifuge'
eflbct
cannot
explain
this
sub-Kolmogorov
scale
clustering.
Motivated
by this observation,
we
have
developed
an analytical
theory
for the pair
correlation
function
for particles
with
a small
but
finite
Stokes
number.
The
theory
treates
the
particle
dynamics
as
a Markov
process,
in which
a drift
is generated
by
the
tendency
of particle
pairs
to occupy
regions
of higher
strain
than
vorticity.
This
drift
is opposed
by turbulent
diffusion,
which
turns
out
to be
a
nonlocal
process
due
to the
finite
correlation
length
of the
fluctuations.
The
theory
predicts
a power
law for the pair
correlation
function
that
is in good
agreement
with
direct
numerical
simulations
and
stochastic
simulations
of the
velocity
gradient
fbllowing
a particle
trajectory.
The
theory
does
not
predict
the
Reynolds
number
dependence
of the
pair
correlation
function
directly
(an
important
issue
in the
cloud
physics
problem),
but
relates
it to the
Reynolds
number
dependence
of Lagrangian
velocity
statistics.
These
were
studied
over
the
limited
range
of Reynolds
numbers
that
can
be
achieved
in the
direct
numerical
simulations;
the
results
suggest
a saturation
of the
effbct
at high
Reynolds
number,
in agreement
with
recent
high-Reynolds-number
simulations
of particle
populations
(Keswani
& Collins
2002).

Abstract
The
electric
or magnetic
field-induced
aggregation
of polarizable
particles
produces
a
rapid
rheological
transition
known
as electrorheological
(ER)
or magnetorheological
(MR)
response.
The ability
to tune
these
interactions
with
an external
field
makes
them
attractive
for
feedback-controlled
devices
such
as shock
absorbers
and suspension
systems.
In response
to an
applied
magnetic
field,
paramagnetic
colloidal
suspensions
aggregate
into anisotropic
microstructures
that produce
the bulk
rheological
response.
The microstructure
is composed
of
chains,
columns
of chains
and chain
networks.
The deformation
and rupturing
of this
microstructure
leads
to a finite
yield
stress
for the suspension.
In this work,
we investigate
the
strengths
and interactions
of chains
and columns
of chains
to compression
parallel
to the applied
magnetic
field
with optical
tweezers.
Optical
trapping
is used to manipulate
the microstructure
and to measure
the forces
resisting
its distortion.
The iron oxide
present
in the particles
prevents
us from
trapping
them
directly,
so we use a tether-handle
system
utilizing
latex
particles
attached
to the magnetic
particles
via the biotin-streptavidin
binding
reaction.
Using
optical
traps, we explore
the response
of single
chains
and columns
of chains
to
compression.
We
find that chains
bend
and undergo
reorganization
processes
before
their
ultimate
failure
due to rupture.
We believe
that these
reorganization
events
are key mechanisms
of stress
reduction.
Columns
of chains
exhibit
the same
mechanisms,
but higher
forces
are
required
for both the rearrangements
and column
failure.
This strengthening
is caused
by the
enhanced
local
field
due to additional
magnetized
particles
and the additional
strength
of the
column
due to the multiple
chain
interactions.
We show how
these
studies
provide
mechanistic
explanations
of magnetic
suspension
rheology.
We model
the microstructures
and forces
through
numerical
simulations.

DIFFUSIVE
COARSENING
OF
LIQUID
FOAMS
IN
MICROGRAVITY
Igor
N. Veretennikov
and James
A. Glazier
Department
of Physics,
University
of Notre Dame,
Notre Dame,

Our
main
goal
is to simulate,
to some
extent,
microgravity
conditions
in the
presence
of
gravity,
to
check
the
stages
of a proposed
scenario
for
coarsening
of
"space"
foams,
and
to
determine
relations
between
foam
structure
and
wetness
and rheological
properties.
Our current
focus
is on preliminary
experiments
needed
for MRI
studies
of stabilized
foam:
optimization
of
the
foam's
composition,
of
imaging
parameters
and the
investigation
of foam
stability
against
global
convection.
To mimic
foam
behavior
under
microgravity,
we
stabilize
the foam
by supplying
extra
fluid
on the top of the foam
head.
While
this fluid
increases
the MRI
signal,
it also
creates
some
extra
problems.
Although
the Plateau
borders
have
no breaks
and are well
resolved,
the image
is noisy
and difficult
to analyze.
Noise
sources
include:
1) higher
water
content
increases
the signal
from
the membranes,
which
registers
as noise
since
the membranes
remain
unresolved.
2) The
extra
flow
in the membranes
creates
ghosts
in the images
due to phase
errors.
3) The weak
signal
from
the Plateau
borders
is averaged
over
a large
voxel
volume.
To understand
the relative
importance
of each
noise
source
and to find
an effective
way to eliminate
or reduce
it, we conducted
several
series
of experiments
with
solid
gelatin-based
foams.
We make
the foam
from
a heated
gelatin-
water
solution
and cool it immediately
after
foam
generation.

Then
we image
the
resulting
motionless
foam
using
various
imaging
parameters.
Figure
l a
shows
a sample
central
slice
from
a 256x128x128
MRI
image.
Some
noise
is still
present,
especially
in the central
part,
where
Plateau
borders
are thinner,
suggesting
that
"partial
volume"
artifact
is important.
The
512x256x256
image
of the same
foam
in Figure
lb has twice
the spatial
resolution
(below
100 lam, which
is below
the Plateau
border
thickness)
and is completely
noise-
free. We will use such
clean
images
as real test data for our 3D data analysis
algorithm.
Another
interesting
phenomenon
in images
of solidified
foams
(especially
apparent
in Figure
la)
is the presence
of "lines"
of increased
gelatin
content,
inclined
at about
45 ° from
the vertical
and
directed
from
the tube
axis
to the
wall.
They
seem
to appear
during
solidification
of the
NASA/T_2002-211211
75

gelatin
and are related
to the stress
distribution
in the solidifying
foam.
In liquid
foams,
we never
see
anything
similar.
Examining
this
effect
in more
detail
may
be
important
for
solid
foam
production.
"Stabilized"
foams
are convectively
unstable
if the flow
rate
exceeds
some
critical
value.
We
have
carried
out
extensive
experimental
studies
of these
instabilities
to avoid
convection
during
MRI
imaging.
CMC-water
solutions
with
different
CMC
concentrations
and different
surfactants
were
used
as basic
fluids.
Foam
was
generated
in a glass
cylinder
50 cm
long
with
an inner
diameter
of
45
mm.
After
foam
equilibration,
we
increased
the
flow
rate
slowly
in
small
increments
until
the
foam
began
to move.
We
define
the
critical
flow
rate
as the
flow
rate
at
which
global
convection,
which
affects
every
bubble,
starts.
The critical
flow
drops
very fast with
increasing
viscosity,
and remains
almost
constant
when
viscosity
is higher
than
about
8 cPoise.
It
is almost
independent
of the chemical
composition
of the surfactant.
Figure
2 shows
the critical
flow
rate
data.
While
the physical
mechanism
of these
instabilities
remains
unclear,
the
most
surprising
result
was
our detection
of a compression
wave
that
precedes
a melting
wave.
Foam
melting
occurs
at
a
local
wetness
level
well
below
the
expected
35%.
The
flow
through
membranes
is significant,
not negligible.

This
convective
instability
may seriously
affect
our proposed
scenario
for the aging
of "space
foam."
Our
preliminary
analysis
of
experimental
data
suggests
that
there
are
two
critical
parameters
- the membrane
thickness
(which
directly
relates
to the local
foam
wetness)
and the
shear
rate
(specified
by
the
basic
fluid
viscosity,
bubble
size
and
transverse
fluctuations
in
pressure)
determining
the
instability
onset.
During
the aging
of "space
foam,"
we
expect
both
average
bubble
size
and
membrane
thickness
to increase.
Hence,
at some
stage,
the
pressure
fluctuations
(caused,
for
example,
by bubble
disappearance)
may
induce
global
convection.
The
latter,
in turn,
should
affect
the bubble
size
distribution
in a way similar
to that
observed
in our
earth-based
experiments:
strong
convection
leads
to very homogeneous
foam.

ABSTRACT
Our
work
involves
both
experimentation
and
simulation
of
aggregating
particle
systems
that
form
fractal
aggregates
that
eventually
fill space
to form
gels.
Our experimental
system
is soot
in diffusion
flames.
Our
simulations
model
these
flames
as
3d, off
lattice,
Brownian
motion
systems,
also
known
as
diffusion
limited
cluster
aggregation
(DLCA).
We
observe
in these
systems
the
behavior
of
the
kinetics,
cluster
size
distribution,
and
cluster
morphology
as the
system
evolves
from
dilute
to concentrated
and finally
to the gel.
With
simulations,
we find
that
the dynamical
evolution
of the system
obeys
typical
DLCA
type
kinetics
at early
times
when
the
system
is dilute
with
a constant
kinetic
exponent
z=l
and
size
distribution
exponent
)_=0. With
increasing
aggregation
time
crowding
of clusters
occurs
and the
kinetics
can be described
by continuously
evolving
exponents.
Both
exponents
show
universal
behavior
with
aggregate
volume
fraction,
independent
of
the
initial
volume
fraction.
Remarkably,
the relationship
between
z and )_ maintains
it's
mean-field
nature
i.e.,
mean
field
kinetics
continue
to hold when
the system
is crowded.
Small
angle
light
scattering
from
heavily
sooting
flames
shows
submicron
D =1.8
fractal
aggregates
early
in the flame
but
later,
as the soot
growth
continues,
a new
supermicron
phase
appears
with
a fractal
dimension
of ca. 2.7.
Simulations
show
essentially
the same
behavior
and
allow
us
to
determine
that
these
superaggregates
occur
when
the
smaller,
D = 1.8
DLCA
aggregates
percolate.
With
this,
we propose
the following
picture
of the sol-to-gel
transition:
A
dilute
sol aggregates
via DLCA
or RLCA
kinetics
yielding
aggregates
with
fractal
dimensions
of
D=l.8
or 2.15,
respectively.
Because
these
aggregate
fractal
dimensions
are
less
than
the
spatial
dimension,
the
effective
aggregate
volume
fraction
(the
occupied
volume
of
the
aggregates
normalized
by the
system
volume)
approaches
unity
as the
aggregation
proceeds.
Structure
factor
results
for
the
largest
cluster
and
the
entire
system
imply
that
the
fractal
dimension
of the
aggregates
remains
1.8 (or 2.15
for RLCA)
right
up to the ideal
gel point.
At
the
ideal
gel
point,
the
aggregates
are
so
crowded
that
they
percolate
to
form
a
D = 2.6
superaggregate
made
up of D = 1.8 (or 2.15
for RLCA)
aggregates
with
an average
size of Rg,_,
the ideal
gel point
radius
of gyration.

ABSTRACT
We use
confocal
microscopy
to directly
study
the microscopic
behavior
of colloidal
glasses
and
colloidal
supercooled
liquids.
In particular
we embed
superparamagnetic
particles
into the
system
of non-magnetic
PMMA
colloids
and
then
exert
an
external
magnetic
force
on these
particles
to locally
perturb
the sample
in a controlled
manner.
We investigate
the range
of these
perturbations
as
a function
of
magnetic
particle
size,
magnetic
force,
and
colloidal
particle
concentration,
in samples
approaching
the colloidal
glass
transition.
The results
of such
studies
address
broader
issues
of both
a universal
description
of the origin
of the glass
transition
and also
the flow
of granular
media
studied
by other
groups.
Three
superparamagnetic
particles

together,

in a sample
of 2 micron

The magnetic
chain
is rotated
using

field,
and the motion
of the other
particles
is
examined.
In these
pictures,
the chain
is
rotating
at 1.25

Abstract
The dynamics
of miscible
displacements
in a cylindrical
tube is being
studied
experimentally
and
numerically,
specifically
when
a more
viscous
fluid displaces
a less viscous
fluid.
In the converse
situation
where
a less viscous
fluid displaces
a more
viscous
fluid,
a fingering
instability
is known
to occur
(Petitjeans
and Maxworthy,
1996),
and a flight
experiment
proposedby
Maxworthy
and
Meiburg
to investigate
the interface
dynamics
in this
case is currently
being
developed
by NASA.
From
the current
theory
of miscible
displacements,
developed
for
a porous
medium
satisfying
Darcy's
law (see reviewby
Homsy,
1987),
it canbe
shown
that in the absence
of gravity
the inter-
face between
the fluids
is destabilized
and thus
susceptible
to fingering
only when
a more
viscous
fluid is displaced
by a less viscous
one.
Therefore,
the initial
flat interface
in the displacement
of
a less viscous
fluid by a more
viscous
one ought
to be stable.
However,
numerical
simulations
by
Chen
and Meiburg
(1996)
for such displacement
in a cylindrical
tube
show that
for a viscosity
ratio
equal to e, a finger
of the more
viscous
fluid is indeed
formed.
These
calculations
were restricted
to
axisymmetric
solutions
of the Stokes
equations
that are valid for negligible
values
of the Reynolds
number.
We report
on the
experiments
that
we
have
conducted
to date
when
a more
viscous
fluid
dis-
places
a less viscous
one in a vertical
cylindrical
tube.
The experiments
show that not
only
can a
finger
form
in this instance
but
also that
under
certain
conditions
the advancing
finger
achieves
a
sinuous
or snake-like
spatial
pattern.
These
experiments
were
performed
using
silicone
oils in a
vertical
pipette
of small
diameter.
The more
viscous
fluid
also
has a slightly
larger
density
than
the less viscous
fluid.
In the initial
configuration,
the fluids
were
under
rest,
and the interface
was
nominally
flat.
Both
stably
and unstably
stratified
initial
configurations
were
studied.
A dye was
added
to the more
viscous
fluid
for ease
of observation
of the interface
between
the fluids.
The
flow was initiated
by pumping
the more
viscous
fluid into the less
viscous
one.
The displacement
velocity
was such
that the Reynolds
number
is small
compared
to one, and the Peclet number
for
mass
transfer
among
the fluids
is large
compared
to one.
The gravitational
effects
are represented
by the dimensionless
parameter
F
_where
9 is the acceleration
due to gravity,
Ap is the
density
difference
between
the fluids,
d is the tube
diameter,
# is the viscosity
of the more
viscous
fluid,
and U is the displacement
speed.

The spatial
pattern
is not a helical
three
dimensional
pattern,
and appears
to be two dimensional.
Experiments
are in progress
to obtain
F_ as a function
of the viscosity
ratio
of the fluids.
For an upward
displacement
of the more
viscous
fluid
from
an initially
stable
configuration,
only
an axisymmetric
finger
is observed
under
all conditions.
When
F
is small,
the effect
of gravity
is
small
and the shape
of the finger
is qualitatively
similar
to that observed
for downward
displace-
ment.
For a larger
value
of F, the finger
has a blunt
shape.
However,
a needle
shaped
spike
is seen
to propagate
from
the main
finger,
similar
to that observed
by Petitjeans
and Maxworthy
(1996).
Numerical
simulations
of the miscible
displacement
process,
starting
from
an initially
flat inter-
face,
are in progress.
The goal
is to identify
the conditions
when
the interface
achieves
a sinuous
shape.
When
such
a shape
is computed,
we will compare
the onset
condition
and the post
onset
wavelength
to experimental
results.
The computations
will involve
time accurate
three
dimensional
simulations
of the momentum
and mass transport
equations.
Joseph
and Renardy
(1993)
show that,
in general,
one must
consider
the following
effects
in the mixing
region
(i) a non-vanishing
of the
divergence
of the velocity
field caused
by density
changes
of a fluid element
due to diffusion
(ii)
Korteweg
stresses,
which
accounts
for forces
in the fluids
caused
by concentration
gradients.
We
will perform
computations
without
and with these
effects,
for various
values
of the system
param-
eters,
chiefly
the F parameter,
the viscosity
and density
ratio,
the Peclet
number
for mass transport
and non-dimensional
parameters
associated
with the Korteweg
stresses.
The Reynolds
number
will
be small
compared
to one; however,
we will retain
the non-linear
inertial
terms
in the momentum
equations
recognizing
that they might
be important
in predicting
the complex
interface
shapes.

Drop
coalescence
is a complex
process
due
to the
nonlinear
dynamics
of a system
with
deformable
interfaces.
In earlier
studies
the
effect
of an external
flow on near-contact
motion
of drops
was assumed
to be equivalent
to an external
body
force
[1-3].
Accordingly,
the direct
coupling
between
thin-film
flow
(in the
near-contact
region)
and
flow inside
the
drops
was
neglected.
These
assumptions
have
been
used
in calculations
of collisional
efficiencies
[4]
and
analyses
of experimental
results
[5-7].
Our
investigations
show
that
for
drops
with
tangentially
mobile
interfaces
the
above
assumptions
do not
hold.
The
velocity
field
produced
inside
the
drops
by the
external
flow
couples
to the
film
motion
through
tangential
stress
f:¢
acting
on
the
film
interface.
For
sufficiently
thin
films
(e.g.,
long
times),
this
stress
qualitatively
alters
the
dynamics
of the
lubrication
region
by arresting
or enhancing
film drainage.
Scaling
analysis
The
effect
of an
external
flow
on
drop
motion
can
be
understood
by
considering
the
magnitude
of the
stress
f_¢.
The
external
flow varies
on the
length
scale
of
the
drop
diameter
a and
vanishes
at
the
axis
of symmetry
of the
film,
thns
foo _
#;yrocla.
(1)
Here
#
is the
drop
viscosity,
r_
is the
lateral
dimension
of the
thin
film,
and
7 is the
magnitude
of the
external
flow.
For
given
external
flow
and
force,
the
pressure
gradient
in the
film p' and
lateral
dimension
r_
are
nearly
independent
of film
thickness
h.
It
thus
follows
that
f_
_
hp'
(2)
for sufficiently
small
h.
Hence,
external-flow-induced
stress
f_
affects
the
thin
film behavior.
Numerical
results
These
predictions
are illustrated
in Fig.
1, where
results
form
axisym-
metric
boundary-integral
simulations
are
shown
for
two
drops
with
a constant
interracial
tension
a.
The
drops
are immersed
in an external
creeping
flow field
u_ = _(½r(_r
- Z_z)
or
subjected
to body
forces
F e = F,efiz, where
i = 1, 2.
For
drops
in straining
flow,
the
flow-induced
stress
.f_
is directed
toward
the
symmetry
axis;
in this
case,
at long
times
a stationary
film
profile
is attained.
For
drop
motion
driven
by the
external
forces,
f_¢
is directed
away
from
the
symmetry
axis,
and
the
film
drains
exponentially
with
time.
In
contrast
to the
above
results,
in the
absence
of flow-induced
stresses
(f_
= 0) the
film
has
algebraic
long-time
behavior
[8].
Asymptotic
analysis
For sufficiently
weak
external
flow and
force,
drops
are nearly
spher-
ical
(except
in the
near-contact
region),
and
the
extent
of the
thin
film
is small.
In
this
regime,
the
hydrodynamic
forces
F n
acting
on the
drops
and
the
interfacial
stress
f_
were
calculated
by
solving
the
outer
problem
of two
tangential
spherical
drops
in
an
external
flow.

Conclusions
We have
shown
that
external
flow can
arrest
or enhance
drainage
of a thin
film
separating
drops
in near-contact
motion.
The
effect
of flow
remains
finite
even
for
small
capillary
numbers,
provided
that
the
film
thickness
is sufficiently
small.
Therefore,
this
effect
needs
to be included
in predictions
of collisional
efficiencies
and
interpretation
of
experimental
data.
Our
analysis
is also
applicable
to thin-film
flows
that
involve
Marangoni
or thermocapillary
stresses.

Buoyancy-driven
motion
of a liquid
drop
in a Hele-Shaw
cell
filled
with
a second
immiscible
liquid
is considered.
In the
absence
of surfactants,
a circle
is an exact
solution
to the
depth-
averaged
Hele-Shaw
equations.
A circular
drop
is shown
to be
linearly
stable
to infinitesimal
shape
perturbations
provided
the
interracial
tension
is finite.
The
evolution
of the
shape
of a
translating
drop
subject
to
finite
initial
shape
deformations
is studied
by
using
the boundary
integral
method
to solve
the
Hele-Shaw
equations.
Drops
that
are
initially
elongated
in the
direction
of motion
are found
to revert
to a circular
shape
for all Bond
numbers
considered.
The
stability
of the shape
of drops
that
are initially
flattened
(elongated
normal
to the direction
of
motion)
depends
on the extent
of their
initial
deformation
and the Bond
number.
Experimental
observations
of
transient
drop
shapes
show
good
qualitative
agreement
with
the
numerical
predictions
for
both
symmetric
and
asymmetric
initial
shape
perturbations.
In the presence
of
adsorbed
surfactants,
the interface
separating
the drop
from
the continuous
liquid
phase
possesses
its
own
distinct
rheological
properties.
As
the
drop
moves,
the
adsorbed
surfactants
are
constantly
redistributed
along
the
interface
by
advection
and
diffusion,
and
give
rise
to non-
uniformities
in interracial
tension
along
the interface.
This,
in turn,
affects
the movement
of the
drop
and
its
shape
evolution.
Dynamics
of translating
drops
in the presence
of bulk-insoluble
surfactants
are examined
using
the Langmuir
adsorption
framework
in conjunction
with
a slip
layer
model
derived
for the depth-averaged
tangential
stress
exerted
on the two-phase
interface.
Given
the
initial
shape
of
the
drop
and
the
buoyancy
force
acting
on
it,
the
interracial
distributions
of velocity
and surfactant
concentration
are computed,
and the evolution
of the drop
shape
is followed
in time in order
to identify
the effect
of interface
contamination
on the critical
conditions
for drop
breakup.

ABSTRACT
Collisions
of small
particles
with
other
particles
or surfaces
play
key roles
in industrial
and
natural
processes
such
as filtration,
agglomeration,
granular
flow,
sand
blasting,
pollen
capture,
planetary-ring
dynamics,
and
clean-room
applications.
The
surfaces
are
wet
in many
cases,
which
can cause
the particles
to stick
or have reduced
kinetic
energy
due to viscous
losses.
Davis
et al.
(1986)
first
analyzed
the problem
of a particle
colliding
with
a wet
surface,
which
they
called
an
elastohydrodynamic
collision,
by
numerically
solving
the
coupled
lubrication
equation
for the fluid
velocity
and pressure
and
the solid-elasticity
equation
for the
Hertzian
deformation
of the
surfaces.
They
showed
that
the
collision
and
rebound
process
is
governed
by two dimensionless
parameters:
St = mVo/( 6rc11a2 )
,
40ll
3/2/
5/2
=
Voa
x o
,
Stokes
number
elasticity
parameter
(1)
(2)
where
m = 4rca3pJ3
is the mass
of the ball,
a is its radius,
ps is its density,
11is the fluid viscosity,
Vo
is
the
impact
velocity
starting
at
a
separation
Xo
between
the
surfaces,
O=(l-v()/(_rE1)+(l-v_)/(_rE2),
and
vi and Ei
are Poisson's
ratio
and
Young's
modulus
of
elasticity
for the ball
(i = 1) and plane
(i = 2).
The same
analysis
applies
for the collision
of two
spheres,
with a and m then
equal
to the reduced
radius
and mass,
respectively.
The
analysis
of Davis
et al. (1986)
predicts
that
no rebound
will
occur
when
the
Stokes
number
is less
than
a critical
value
(St < Stc),
due
to viscous
dissipation
of the
initial
kinetic
energy
of the sphere.
The value
of the critical
Stokes
number
for rebound
is predicted
to depend
weakly
on the elasticity
parameter,
increasing
from
Stc -_ 1.5 at c = 10 -2 to Stc -_ 8 at c = 10 -8.
Rebound
is predicted
for
St > Stc, and
Davis
et
al.
(2002)
have
used
lubrication
theory
for
undeformed
spheres
and scaling
relations
for elastic
deformation
to predict
that
the coefficient
of
restitution
is then
vr/v o -e_t
:%y(1-StJSt)
,
(3)
where
vr is the rebound
velocity,
ewet is the coefficient
of restitution
for a wet surface,
edry is the
coefficient
of restitution
for a dry surface,
and the critical
Stokes
number
for smooth
surfaces
is
=21nI4qr21

To
test
the
theory,
experiments
were
performed
to
measure
the
rebound
velocities
of
small
plastic
and
metal
spheres
dropped
from
various
heights
onto
a smooth
quartz
surface
coated
with
a thin
layer
of
viscous
fluid.
Similar
experiments
involving
spheres
fully
immersed
in
a large
body
of fluid
have
been
reported
recently
by
Joseph
et al.
(2001)
and
Gondret
et al.
(2002).
The
spheres
stick
without
rebounding
for
low
impact
velocities,
due
to viscous
dissipation
in the
thin
fluid
layer
(Figure
1).
Above
a critical
impact
velocity,
however,
the
lubrication
forces
in the
thin
layer
cause
elastic
deformation
and
rebound
of
the
spheres.
The
apparent
coefficient
of
restitution
increases
with
the
ratio
of the
Stokes
number
to its
critical
value
for
rebound
(Figure
2).
The
experimental
results
show
good
agreement
with
the
model,
except
that
there
is
considerable
scatter
in the
data
(which
may
be
due
to surface
roughness).
Additional
work
is underway
on
oblique
collisions
and
on
slow-speed
collisions.
The
latter
will
require
a low-gravity
environment.

ABSTRACT
W% consider
a forced
liquid
flow
in
an
open
capillary
channel
with
free
liquid
surfaces
under
low gravity.
The
channel
consists
of two
parallel
plates
and
is shown
in Figure
1. The
liquid
flows
along
the
z-axis
from
the
inlet
to the
outlet
and
forms
free
surface
at
the
sides
between
the
plates.
The
flow
is maintained
by external
pumps
and
the
free
surface
deforms
according
to the
pressure
along
the
flow
path.
Since
the
free
surface
can
only
withstand
a
certain
difl%rence
between
the
liquid
pressure
and
the
ambient
pressure
the
flow
rate
in the
channel
is limited.
The
aim
of the
consideration
is also
to determine
the
shape
of the
free
surface
and
to find the
maximum
flow rate
without
a collapse
of the
free surface.
This
critical
flow rate
depends
on the geometry
of the channel
and the
properties
of the
liquid,
specified
by
the
three
dimensionless
parameters,
the
OHNESORGE
number
Oh
(p_'2)/(2cra),
the
aspect
ratio
A
b/a
and
the
dimensionless
length
[ (p is the density,
u the
kinematic
viscosity
and
(7 the
surface
tension
of the
fluid).

The
experimental
investigations
were
performed
in the

Bremen
and
on board
the

rocket
TEXUS-37.
In the
TEXUS
experiment
the
volume
flux
was
increased
in small
steps
up
to the
critical
value
(quasistatic
approach)
and
the
surface
collapse
was
observed
by video
cameras.
The
main
data
are
the
positions
of the
liquid
surfaces
k(z)
as
function
of the
adjusted
volume
flux
and
the
critical
flow
rate.
The
results
are discussed
in
[1],[2]and [3].
W% developed
a one
dimensional,
stationary
mathematical
model
from
the
mass
and
momentum
conservation
equations.
The
model
contains
the
pressure
gradient
caused
by
the
shape
of the
free
surface
taking
into
account
both
radii
of
curvature,
the
convective
acceleration
due
to
the
change
in cross
section
and
the
friction
losses
in the
channel.

have
to deal
with
an
entrance
flow
problem,
thus
the
velocity
distribution
does
not
obey
a
simple
parabolic
profile.
The
solution
of the
nonlinear
diflSrential
system
is obtained
by a
ditI_rence
schemata
(FDM)
of second
order
and
the
Newton
method.
This
yields
the
free
surface,
the
mean
velocity
and
the
curvature,
depending
on
the
parameters.
Furthermore
we are able
to anticipate
the
critical
volume
flux
in a numerical
sense.
The
numerical
results
for the
free
surface
position
and
the
critical
volume
flux
shows
a very
good
agreement
with
the
experimental
data
[3].

For
the

the

appropriate
and
provides

insight
into

results
from

calculation

The
computations
are
close
to
the
critical
volume
flux.
The
left
picture
shows
the
case
of low
Ohnesorge
number
and
short
channel
length.
The
smallest
cross
section
is approximately
in the
middle
of the
channel.
Especially
the
mean
curvature
at
the
inlet
is approximately
equal
to the
curvature
at the
outlet.
The
right
picture
shows
the
case
of large
Ohnesorge
number
and
large
channel
length.
The
free surface
has
a strong
slope
to fit the
boundary
condition
at the
outlet.
The
mean
curvature
increases
nearly
linear
and
the
ditISrence
between
inlet
and
outlet
is very
high.
The
integration
of the
momentum
equation
shows,
that
the
curvature
difference
between
inlet
and
outlet
is
a measure
for
the
friction
pressure
loss
in
the
channel.
For
small
flow
lengths
[ <
10
s
the
pressure
loss
between
inlet
and
outlet
is small,
thus
the
flow
is dominated
by
convective
momentum
transport.
In
the
other
extreme
of
a very
long
channel,
[ _> 10
1, the
flow is dominated
by viscous
momentum
transport
and
the
curvature
ditISrence
tends
to unity.
This
limit
can
be taken
to predict
the
maximal

for a

ABSTRACT
In low
gravity,
the solid-liquid
inter-molecular
surface
forces
are comparable
to capillary
and
gravitational
forces
at significantly
greater
film
thickness
(1 ~ 10 microns),
than
is
possible
in earth's
gravity
(0.01
~ 0.1 microns).
Therefore,
advanced
microscale
optical
techniques
to measure
the film
thickness,
heat
transport,
and liquid
velocity
fields
in the
transition
film
region
of
an extended
meniscus;
probing,
for
the
first
the thermo-fluid
transport
inside
this very
important
micro-scale
region.
Since
the project
initiation
in the beginning
of 2002,
a preliminary
ground
study
has
been
done
to
implement
a
Molecular
Fluorescence
Tracking
Velocimetry
(MFTV)
system
(Fig.
1), utilizing
caged
fluorophores
of approximately
10-nm
in size
as seeding
particles,
ultimately
to
measure
the
velocity
profiles
in
the
thin
film
region.
Fizeau
interferometry
in conjunction
with
a microscope
has been
completed
to measure
the thin
film slope
and thickness
variations.
Although
the
extension
of
the
thin
film
dimensions
under
microgravity
will
be
achieved
by using
a conical
evaporator,
a simpler
and
easy-to-fabricate
evaporator
has
been
designed
and
constructed
for
the
ground
test
(Fig.
2).
Note
that
the
experimental
setup
is to maintain
a constant
liquid
volume
and liquid
pressure
in the capillary
region
of
the evaporating
meniscus
so as to insure
quasi-stationary
conditions
during
measurements
on the transition
film region.
In addition,
the new
Confocal
Laser
Scanning
Microscopy
(CLSM),
available
at Dr.
Kihm's
laboratory,
has
been
tested
for
its
optical
sectioning
capability
allowing
a depth-wise
resolution
for MFTV
applications.
A micro-heater
array
has been
fabricated
using
photo-lithography
to etch
and vapor
deposit
platinum
films
(Fig.
3). The
heater
array
is packaged
on a thin
silicon
substrate
and
then
the upper
face
of the substrate
is planarized
to form
a smooth
contact
surface.
Individual
heater
elements
(20-gm-wide
and 20-mm
long)
are designed
to maintain
either
a constant
surface
temperature
or
a
controlled
temperature
variation.
A
Wheatstone
bridge
circuit
controls
each
heater
element
with
the
temperature-dependent
heater
resistance
value
as a feedback
signal.

ABSTRACT
A
new
membrane-casting
apparatus
is
developed
for
studying
macrovoid
defects
in
polymeric
membranes
made
by the wet-
and dry-casting
process
in low-gravity.
Macrovoids
are
large
(10-50
gm),
open
cavities
interspersed
among
the smaller
pores
in the substructure
under
the gelled
skin
surface
layer
of the cast
membrane
[1]. Although
their
occurrence
is considered
endemic
to the wet-
and dry-casting
process
since
they can
lead to compaction
or skin rupture
in
the membrane
process
[2], recent
studies
suggest
several
useful
applications
such
as transdermal
and
osmotic
drug
delivery
systems
[3,4],
miniature
bioreactors
[5],
etc.
However,
lack
of
knowledge
about
the macrovoid
formation
mechanism
is an obstacle
to further
development
of
applications
using
them.
An
on-going
debate
is
the
role
of
the
surface-tension-driven
solutocapillary
convection
during
macrovoid
formation.
The rapid
growth
of macrovoids
within
1-5 seconds
and
the
high
polymer
concentration
in and
near
macrovoids
make
it difficult
to
explain
the mechanism
of macrovoid
growth
by diffusion
alone,
which
is the widely
accepted
hypothesis
proposed
by Reuvers
et al.
[6].
The hypothesis
advanced
by our research
group
can
explain
this rapid
growth
via a mechanism
that involves
diffusion
from
the casting
solution
in the
meta-stable
region
to the macrovoid
enhanced
by solutocapillary
convection
induced
by the steep
nonsolvent
concentration
gradient
in the vicinity
of the macrovoid.
Since
macrovoid
growth
is hypothesized
to be
the
interplay
of
a solutocapillary-induced
driving
force
counteracted
by viscous
drag
and buoyancy,
eliminate
the latter
provides
a means
for testing
this hypothesis.
Moreover,
free convection
mass
transfer
in the nonsolvent
immersion
bath
used
to cause
phase-separation
in membrane
casting
complicates
developing
a model
for
both
the
wet-casting
process
and
macrovoid
growth.
The
low-g
environment
minimizes
gravitationally
induced
free
convection
thereby
permitting
a tractable
solution
to the
ternary
diffusion
equations
that characterize
membrane
formation.
NASA's
Parabolic
Flight
Research
Aircraft
provides
a small
window
of low-g
(~25
s) that
can
be
used
to
study
macrovoid
development
in
both
wet-
and
dry-cast
membranes
if
an
appropriate
casting
apparatus
is used.
This casting
apparatus
should
be able to cast the membrane
in both
low-
and high-g
in a manner
so that
essential
one-dimensional
mass
transfer
conditions
are
achieved
to
insure
lateral
uniformity
in
the
membrane.
The
apparatus
used
in previous
research
on membrane
casting
in low-gravity
was
operated
with
the plunger
driven
mechanism.
The spring-loaded
plunger

membranesmadevia thiscastingapparatusoftendisplayedlateralnonuniformitiesthatprecluded
obtainingquantitativeinformationon themacrovoidgrowthprocess.Thus,it wasnecessaryto
determinethereasonfor thesestructuralirregularitiesobservedin thelow-gcastingapparatus.
Both experimentalaswell ascomputersimulationstudiesof the low-g castingapparatus
establishedthat the impulsive action of the plunger causedthe undesiredstructural
nonuniformities. The simulationresultsshowedthat the width-to-depthaspectratio of the
shallowwell thatcontainsthecastingsolutionin thisapparatuswasnot animportantfactorin

causeda "sloshing"of the castingsolutionthathad to be eliminated.Therefore,theplunger-
drivenmechanismwaschangedto a cam-drivenmechanismthat did not causeanyimpulsive
motion of the castingsolution.Otherrefinementsto this new membrane-castingapparatus
includeprovision for removingthe membranesfrom the castingwells in a lessdestructive
manner.This was accomplishedby usinga slit geometryfor the castingwell that permitted
disassemblyfor removalof the castmembrane.Thematerialsusedin theconstructionof this
castingapparatuswerechosento insurewettingatthesidewallsandto maintainprecisecontrol

of
0 was 2.75°;
the measured
value
of 0 was 2.53 °. When
the cylinder's
inner
surface
is pre-wetted,
c_ is closer
to ]3, and 0 is decreased
significantly.
B.
Viscous
drag
on a fluid
slug:
Constant
motion
of a fluid
slug
is achieved
by inclining
the
tube.
Video
is used
to capture
the
subsequent
motion.
When
a constant
slug
velocity
results,
equilibrium
presumably
requires
the driving
force
(i.e. pressure
force
due to gravity)
to equal
the
sum
of
the
viscous
and
the
contact
line
forces.
The
liquid
flow
field
is complicated
by
the
deformation
of the ends
of the slug.
For
a slug
with
a large
aspect
ratio
(length
to diameter)
and
8lieU
velocity
U, the pressure
decrease
due to viscosity
should
be
Pv -
R 2
neglecting
the flow
near
the ends.
As the retarding
force
due to the contact
lines
is vastly
different
for dry and pre-wetted
surfaces,
experiments
under
both
conditions
are conducted.
Again,
the contact
line force
for pre-
wetted
tubes
is much
smaller
than
for the
dry tubes.
Especially
for long
cylinders,
the effect
of
air in the tube
is considered
with
this
friction
comparable
to the viscous
effects
directly
on the
slug.
II. Resonance
analyses
and experiments
for fixed
contact
or stick-slip
motion
As the eventual
objective
of this
project
is to control
fluid
flow
in microgravity
by nonlinearity,
we
investigated
the
natural
frequency
of the
end
surfaces
of the
slug.
Presumably,
the natural
frequency
of the
confined
slugs
should
create
the largest
disturbances
of the end
caps,
thereby
producing
maximum
net flow.
The initial
analytic
solution
was based
on the
simplest
model,
a
NASA/T_2002-211211
97

zero-dimension
(0-D)
approximation
(i.e. a liquid
slug where
the center
of mass
shifts
due to the
oscillation
of
its
ends).
Here
the
end-cap
surface
is assumed
spherical
for
the
axisymmetric
geometry,
with
the spherical
segment
set by the contact
angle.
To solve
for the natural
frequency
and its mode
shape,
the potential
flow
problem
for a fixed
contact
line
condition
is formulated
as
a
generalized
eigenvalue
problem.
The
dynamic
and
kinematic
boundary
conditions
are
evaluated
at the
original
equilibrium
surface.
The
surface
elevation
z =q(r,
0 (relative
to the
unperturbed
curved
surface
z
_ (r))
is expressed
as a summation
of basis
functions
(cosine
series,
Chebyshev
polynomials,
etc.)
and
the
problem
is solved
accordingly.
In
figure
1 the
numerical
results
for
the
'slosh
mode'
are
presented
with
direct
comparison
to
the
aforementioned
0-D approximation.
Good
agreement
is observed.
An experiment
was
conducted
to verify
the analysis.
The
measured
slosh
frequency
is smaller
than
the analysis
suggests.
The
deviation
may
be attributed
to viscosity
and possible
contact
line
slip.
The
effect
of partial
slip
was also
evaluated
by introducing
a simple
slip parameter
y,
defined
as a slip coefficient
in the
contact
line
stick-slip
condition:
#7+ ja/y = 0 (r = R).
As
y --> 0, the frequencies
converge
to the
pinned
contact-line
solution.
When
y --> _,
the contact
line
slips
on the wall,
and the frequency
goes
to zero
as the restoring
force
of the meniscus
vanishes.

INTRODUCTION
The difficult
problem
of cryogenic
fluid handling
in many
aerospace
applications
in low gravity
environments
can be solved
by employing
a new
magnetic
fluid
technology
called
magnetic
fluid
management
(MFM).
The
innovative
MFM
technology
has
the potential
to provide
significant
advancements
over
other
technologies
such
as
screens,
vanes,
porous
plugs,
and
no-vent
fill
processes.
MFM
technology
utilizes
the
magnetic
properties
of
cryogenic
fluids
for
phase
separation.
This
enables
new
processes
which
greatly
simplify
many
critical
tasks
now
encountered,
such
as gas-free
liquid
transfer
between
cryogenic
containers,
liquid-free
gas venting
during
storage,
liquid-free
gas venting
during
tank
refill,
and use of a self-regulating
control
system
to maintain
tank pressure
during
liquid
expulsion.
COMPUTATIONAL
MAGNETIC
FLUID
DYNAMICS
(CMFD)
MODELING
The
magnetic
fluid
dynamics
of the MFM
system
is being
modeled
with
a modified
and
enhanced
version
of the RIPPLE
code,
originally
developed
by Los Alamos
National
Laboratory
for
modeling
the
unsteady
flow
of
incompressible,
constant
property,
Newtonian
fluids.
The
ability
of the RIPPLE
code and its variants
to model
flows
with highly
deforming
free surfaces
in
which
surface
tension
forces
are significant
has been
well
documented,
as has been
their
fidelity
in modeling
the propellant
reorientation
process.
Reorientation
is determined
by the magnet's
ability
to influence
a reasonable
portion
of the propellant
to traverse
the tank
wall
and come
in
contact
with the opposing
tank
head.
1-G LABORATORY
TESTING
A
series
of ground-based
experiments
were
designed
to determine
the
effect
of magnetic
fields
on ferrofluid
and LOX
in full gravity.
Initial
CMFD
analyses
of both
LOX
and ferrofluid
motion
in a cylindrical
tank
in a 1-g environment
have
been
conducted
to support
the design
of
ground-based
experiments.
The goal
of this work
is to help
identify
a reasonable
combination
of
magnetic
field
strength,
tank
radius,
and ferrofluid
volume
and concentration
that would
result
in
observable
fluid deformations
in a laboratory
environment.
REDUCED

FLIGHT
TESTING
The KC-135
flight
testing
will
involve
the construction
of two
dewar
systems:
one would
be
transparent
and fully instrumented
to be used
with
ferrofluid
for preliminary
testing;
the other
one
would
be an optimally
designed
cryogenic
dewar
that
is instrumented
as necessary
to validate
the
NASA/T_2002-211211

models. The flight testingwill occurduringtwo differentweeks. Flight experimentswould

to link
all the

etc.
The
data would
be collected
and stored
on a laptop
PC for

The
modified
RIPPLE

has
been
enhanced
to include

increase
the

(performed
in

are being
developed
and performed
as a precursor
to the KC-135

ABSTRACT
A liquid
drop
present
on a solid
surface
can move
because
of a gradient
in wettability
along
the surface,
as manifested
by a gradient
in the contact
angle.
The contact
angle
at a given
point
on the
contact
line
between
a solid
and a liquid
in a gaseous
medium
is the angle
between
the
tangent
planes
to the liquid
and the solid
surfaces
at that
point
and is measured
within
the liquid
side,
by convention.
The
motion
of the
drop
occurs
in the
direction
of increasing
wettability.
The
cause
of the motion
is the net force
exerted
on the
drop
by the solid
surface
because
of the
variation
of the contact
angle
around
the periphery.
This
force
causes
acceleration
of an initially
stationary
drop,
and leads
to its motion
in the direction
of decreasing
contact
angle.
The nature
of
the
motion
is
determined
by
the
balance
between
the
motivating
force
and
the
resisting
hydrodynamic
force
from
the solid
surface
and the surrounding
gaseous
medium.
A wettability
gradient
can
be
chemically
induced
as shown
by Chaudhury
and Whitesides
(1992)
who
provided
unambiguous
experimental
evidence
that
drops
can move
in such gradients.
The
phenomenon
can
be important
in heat
transfer
applications
in low
gravity,
such
as when
condensation
occurs
on a surface.
Daniel
et al. (2001)
have
demonstrated
that
the velocity
of a
drop
on a surface
due to a wettability
gradient
in the presence
of condensation
can be more
than
two orders
of magnitude
larger
than
that
observed
in the absence
of condensation.
In the present
research
program,
we
have
begun
to
study
the
motion
of
a drop
in
a wettability
gradient
systematically
using
a model
system.
Our initial
efforts
will be restricted
to a system
in which
no
condensation
occurs.
The
experiments
are
performed
as
follows.
First,
a rectangular
strip
of
approximate
dimensions
10 x 20 mm
is cut out
of a silicon
wafer.
The
strip
is cleaned
thoroughly
and
its
surface
is exposed
to the vapor
from
an alkylchlorosilane
for
a period
lasting
between
one
and
two
minutes
inside
a desiccator.
This
is done
using
an approximate
line
source
of the vapor
in
the form
of
a string
soaked
in the
alkylchlorosilane.
Ordinarily,
many
fluids,
including
water,
wet
the
surface
of silicon
quite
well.
This
means
that
the
contact
angle
is small.
But
the
silanized
surface
resists
wetting,
with
contact
angles
that
are
as large
as
100 °.
Therefore,
a
gradient
of wettability
is formed
on the
silicon
surface.
The
region
near
the
string
is highly
hydrophobic,
and the contact
angle
decreases
gradually
toward
a small
value
at the hydrophilic
end away
from
this region.
The change
in wettability
occurs
over
a distance
of several
mm.

The
strip
is placed
on a platform
within
a Plexiglas
cell.
Drops
of a suitable
liquid
are
introduced
on top of the
strip near
the hydrophobic
end.
An optical
system
attached
to a video
camera
is trained
on the drop
so that images
of the moving
drop
can be captured
on videotape
for
subsequent
analysis.
We have
performed
preliminary
experiments
with
water
as well
as ethylene
glycol
drops.
Results
from
these
experiments
will be presented
in the poster.
Future
plans
include
the refinement
of the experimental
system
so as to permit
images
to be
recorded
from
the side as well
as the top,
and the conduct
of a systematic
study
in which
the drop
size
is varied
over
a good
range.
Experiments
will be
conducted
with
different
fluids
so as to
obtain
the largest
possible
range
of suitably
defined
Reynolds
and Capillary
numbers.
Also,
an
effort
will
be
initiated
on
theoretical
modeling
of
this
motion.
The
challenges
in
the
development
of the theoretical
description
lie in the proper
analysis
of the region
in the vicinity
of the
contact
line,
as well
as in the
free
boundary
nature
of the
problem.
It is known
that
continuum
models
assuming
the
no
slip
condition
all
the
way
to
the
contact
line
fail
by
predicting
that the stress
on the solid
surface
becomes
singular
as the contact
line is approached.
One
approach
for
dealing
with this
issue
has been
to relax
the no-slip
boundary
condition
using
the Navier
model
(Dussan
V., 1979).
Molecular
dynamics
simulations
of the contact
line
region
show
that
for
a non-polar
liquid
on a solid
surface,
the
no-slip
boundary
condition
is in fact
incorrect
near
the contact
line
(Thompson
et al., 1993).
Furthermore,
the same
simulations
also
show
that
the usual
relationship
between
stress
and the rate
of deformation
breaks
down
in the
vicinity
of the contact
line.
In developing
continuum
theoretical
models
of the system,
we shall
accommodate
this knowledge
to the extent
possible.

ABSTRACT
Microtechnology
was
conceived
as a means
of shrinking
the length
scales
of heat
and mass
transfer
to
100
microns
or
less
so that
orders
of
magnitude
increases
in throughput
can
be
realized
in chemical
processes.
The
subsequent
reduction
in size
and mass
lends
itself
well
to
space
applications.
Using
proprietary
sheet
architecture,
Battelle
has created
such
devices
with
micro
chemical
and
thermal
systems
(MicroCATS)
for
gas
phase
reactions,
heat
transfer
and
solvent
extraction.
Figure

a device

with

size channels

in
such
devices.
Figure

Cross
section
of microchannels
In this
work,
Battelle
has
extended
the
technology
to include
phase
separation
and
partial
condensation
with
phase
separation
in channels
between
100 microns
and
a few
millimeters
at
the
smallest
dimension.
These
length
scale
channels
are advantageous
for
all reduced
gravity
applications
involving
two-phase
flow
since
hydrodynamic,
interfacial
and
capillary
forces
dominate
over
gravitational
forces.
By controlling
the wettability
and porosity
of the materials
within
the
device,
separation
occurs
spontaneously
thus
allowing
high
throughputs
and
easy
recovery
from
process
upsets.
Enhanced
heat
transfer
in the
case
of condensation
is obtained
through
reduction
of
the
narrowest
channel
dimension.
Scale
up
is
achieved
by
simply
increasing
the
number
of
layers.
Potential
space
applications
for
phase
separation
and
condensation
include
water
management
in environmental
control
and life
support
and thermal
systems
involving
phase
change
(heat
pipes,
vapor
compression
cycles).
These
devices
are also
well
suited
for
in-situ
resource
utilization
or "living
off the
land"
since
they
are
compact
and
efficient.
Applications
include
phase
separation
and
condensation
of
water
during
in-situ
propellant
production.

The
performance
is reported
for
a single
channel
phase
separator
in
both
normal
and
microgravity
environments
and for a multi
channel
condenser
in normal
gravity.
A schematic
of
a single
channel
device
is presented
in Figure
2.
In the
case
of phase
separation,
a gas/liquid
mixture
is fed
to the
device
and
no cooling
channel
is present.
Liquid
is moved
through
the
capture
structure
to the wicking
or pore
throat
structure
via capillary
and hydrodynamic
forces,
then
towards
the appropriate
outlet.
The
gas is allowed
to move
freely
through
the device
and
exit through
its outlet.
In the case of partial
condensation
with phase
separation,
vapor
and non-
condensable
gas is fed
to the
device
and a cooling
channel
is present.
Vapor
condenses
on the
wall
nearest
the
cooling
channel
so that
liquid
must
be
moved
to the
liquid
exit
via
capillary
forces.
A multichannel
device
consists
merely
of alternating
layers
of cooling
and condensing
channels.

was essentially
50%,
with the difference
accounted

Capillary
flows
in interior
comers
have
an established
place
in fluids-handling
operations
in
reduced
gravity
environments.
A quantitative
understanding
of comer
flows
is essential
for the
myriad
fluid
management
tasks
in space
including
flows
in liquid-fuel
tanks,
thermal
control
systems,
and life-support
systems.
Though
low-g
fluid
system
designs
are 'largely
successful,'
current
techniques
for predicting
system
performance
are primarily
limited
to order
of magnitude
estimates,
delicately
guided
by
the experience
of the
designer,
or
direct
numerical
simulation
which
can be prohibitively
time consuming.
Highly
reliable
and quantitative
design
tools
serving
between
these
extremes
are welcome
contributions
to the low-g
fluids
management
community.
In this research
effort,
an asymptotic
analysis
developed
and benchmarked
for capillary
flows
in simplified
containers
possessing
interior
comers
[1]
is generalized
and
broadly
applied
to
flows
in containers
and/or
comer
geometries
of increasing
complexity.
Closed
form
solutions
to
important
problems
such
as
interior
comer
transient
flow
rates,
local
and
global
flow
characteristics,
interface
profiles,
and stability
are determined
for a variety
of container
types
and
boundary
conditions.
A partial
list
of problems
addressed
includes
flows
in comers
of infinite
extent
[2],
regular
and
irregular
polygonal
cylinders
[3],
and
complex
'vaned'
containers
modeling
propellant
management
devices
in liquid
fuel tanks
[4]. Other
complicating
conditions
such
as nonplanar
comers,
out-of-plane
comers,
helical
comers,
background
accelerations,
heat
and mass
transfer,
and
interfacial
shear
are addressed.
Applications
of the results
to low-g
fluid
system
design
and analysis
are manifold
and an excellent
example
is provided
by way of a post-
analysis
of NASA's
Vented
Tank Resupply
Experiment
performed
on the shuttle
in 1996.
Extensive
drop
tower
and low-g
aircraft
experiments
are performed
to guide
and/or
support
the development
and
application
of the most
fundamental
aspects
of the theory.
For the special
case
of steady
capillary
driven
flow
the analysis
is readily
extended
to complex
comer
networks
modeling
macroscale
flows
within
intricately
vaned
containers
in space
as well
as microscale
flows
on rough
surfaces
on Earth.

Polymers
of sufficient
length
are known
to quench
turbulence
[1].
However,
the
fundamental
mechanism
of quenching,
namely
the interactions
between
the polymer
and
turbulence,
is
not
well
understood.
In
this
experiment,
we
examine
the
effect
of
a
polymer
additive
to turbulence
in a freely
suspended
film.
The
experimental
geometry
is
two-dimensional
due to the fact that
films
are very
thin, confining
the flow velocity
to the
plane
of the film.
The turbulence
in the film
is created
by electromagnetic
convection
as
delineated
in the figure

Here

rise to a set of vortices.
Various

can be achieved
depending
on the magnitude
of the current,
but
in
this
study
we
are
interested
in
a large

so
that
flow
in the

is
spatiotemporally

The

For

the 2D film

For

ABSTRACT
Protoplanetary
disks,
planetary
rings,
the Kuiper
belt,
and the asteroid
belt
are collisionally
evolved
systems.
Although
objects
in each
system
may
be
bombarded
by
impactors
at high
interplanetary
velocities
(km/s
or higher),
they
are
also
subject
to
repeated
collisions
at low
velocities
(v -
1-100
m/s).
In some
regions
of Saturn's
rings,
for example,
the typical
collision
velocity
inferred
from
observations
by
the
Voyager
spacecraft
and
dynamical
modeling
is
a
fraction
of a centimeter
per
second
[1].
These
interparticle
collisions
control
the rate
of energy
dissipation
in planetary
rings
and
the
rate
of
accretion
in
the
early
stages
of
planetesimal
formation.
Dust
on the surface
of planetary
ring
particles
and small
(1 cm - 10 m) planetesimals
helps
dissipate
energy
in the
collision,
but
may
also
be knocked
off,
forming
dust
rings
in the
case
of ring particles
and slowing
or inhibiting
accretion
in the case of planetesimals.
The
Collisions
Into
Dust
Experiment
(COLLIDE)
is
a
self-contained
autonomous
microgravity
experiment
that
made
its
second
flight
in
the
payload
bay
of
space
shuttle
Endeavour
on flight
STS-108
in December
2001.
COLLIDE-2
(Figure

6 impact
experiments
into
powder
in microgravity
at speeds
between
1.2
and
108
cm/s,
simulating
the
collisions
that occur
in some
astrophysical
systems.

sieved
to the same
size range
in the sixth
experiment.
The experiment
took place
in an
evacuated
standard
space
shuttle
Hitchhiker
container
fourteen
hours
after
launch.
The
temperature
of the
samples
at the time
of the experiment
was
17°C.
Digital
video
recordings
of
the impacts
were
made
using
two
consumer-grade
camcorders,
each
one recording
three
impacts
in sequence.
Analysis
of the video
data
provides
an accurate
measure
of the impactor
velocity
before
and after
impact,
velocity
of the fastest
ej ecta produced
(if any),
and a qualitative
measure
of the amount
of ejecta
produced.
A single

from
one impact
experiment
is shown
in
Figure

On the first
flight
of COLLIDE
on STS-90
in 1998
experiment
malfunctions
prevented
data
from
being
returned
for 3 of the 6 impact
experiments.
Those
experiments
used
JSC-1
as a target
material
for
all impacts,
and included
the
sub-75
gm portion
of the size
distribution.
Impacts
at
15 cm/s
and
17 cm/s
resulted
in virtually
no ej ecta,
and rebound
coefficients
of restitution
were
<0.03.
A similar
coefficient
of restitution
was found
for a third
impact
at 90 cm/s
[2]. The broad
size-distribution
JSC-1
used
in COLLIDE
compacted
during
launch
vibrations
resulting
in
a
cohesive
surface
and
little
or no ejecta
production.
The
quartz
sand
used
in COLLIDE-2
has
rounder
grains
which
do not interlock
with each
other
as much
as the semi-angular
JSC-1
grains.
On COLLIDE-2
we found
significant
ejecta
produced
at impact
speeds
above
20 cm/s
and
no
rebound
of the
impactor
at impact
speeds
below
that
level.

on
COLLIDE-2
was
at a speed
comparable
to
two
impacts
on
COLLIDE,
but with
an impactor
that
was
9 times
more
massive.
On COLLIDE-2
the impactor
remained
embedded
in the target
surface,
in contrast
to the slow
rebound
observed
on COLLIDE.
This
difference
in behavior
is likely
due
to the
absence
of small
particles
in the
COLLIDE-2
target,
increasing
the overall
porosity
of the target
and
allowing
the
surface
to deform
more
in
response
to the collision.

ABSTRACT
Low
velocity
collisions
(v < 100 m/s)
occur
in a number
of astrophysical
contexts,
including
planetary
rings,
protoplanetary
disks,
the
Kuiper
belt
of
comets,
and
in
secondary
cratering
events
on asteroids
and planetary
satellites.
In most
of these
situations
the surface
gravity
of the
target
is less
than
a few
per cent of 1 g. Asteroids
and planetary
satellites
are observed
to have
a
regolith
consisting
of
loose,
unconsolidated
material.
Planetary
ring
particles
likely
are
also
coated
with
dust
based
on
observations
of
dust
within
ring
systems
[1].
The
formation
of
planetesimals
in protoplanetary
disks
begins
with
the accretion
of dust particles.
The response
of
the surface
dust layer
to collisions
in the near
absence
of gravity
is necessary
for understanding
the evolution
of these
systems.
The
Collisions
Into
Dust
Experiment
(COLLIDE)
performs
six
impact
experiments
into
simulated
regolith
in microgravity
conditions
on the space
shuttle
[2]. The parameter
space
to be
explored
is quite
large,
including
effects
such
as impactor
mass
and velocity,
impact
angle,
target
porosity,
size distribution,
and particle
shape.
We have
developed
an experiment,
the Physics
of
Regolith
Impacts
in Microgravity
Experiment
(PRIME),
that
is analogous
to COLLIDE
that
is
optimized
for
flight
on the
NASA
KC-135
reduced
gravity
aircraft.
The
KC-135
environment
provides
the advantage
of more
rapid
turnover
between
experiments,
allowing
a broader
range
of
parameters
to
be
studied
quickly,
and
more
room
for
the
experiment
so that
more
impact
experiments
can be performed
each
flight.
The acceleration
environment
of the KC-13
5 is not as
stable
and minimal
as on the space
shuttle,
and this requires
impact
velocities
to be higher
than
the minimum
achievable
with
COLLIDE.
The
experiment
consists
of an evacuated
PRIME
Impact
Chamber
(PIC)
with
an aluminum
base
plate
and
acrylic
sides
and top (Figure
1). A target tray, launcher,
and mirror
mount
to the
base
plate.
The launcher
may
be positioned
to allow
for impacts
at angles
of 30, 45, 60, and 90
degrees
with
respect
to the target
surface.
The target
material
is contained
in a 10 cm by 10 cm
by 2 cm tray
with
a rotating
door
that is opened
via a mechanical
feed-through
on the base
plate.
A
spring-loaded
inner
door
provides
uniform
compression
on
the
target
material
prior
to
operation
of the
experiment
to keep
the material
from
settling
or locking
up during
vibrations
prior
to the experiment.
Data
is recorded
with
the NASA
high
speed
video
camera.
Frame
rates
are
selected
according
to the
impact
parameters.
The
direct
camera
view
is orthogonal
to the
projectile
line
of motion,
and
the
mirrors
within
the PIC
provide
a view
normal
to the target
surface.
The
spring-loaded
launchers
allow
for projectile
speeds
between
10 cm/s
and 500
cm/s
with
a variety
of impactor
sizes
and densities.
On each
flight
8 PICs
will be used,
each
one with
a different
set of impact
parameters.

ABSTRACT
Multiple
light
scattering
provides
a non-invasive
method
for probing
the structure
of optically
opaque
materials
such
as aqueous
foam,
colloids
and sand.
Diffusion-wave
spectroscopy
(DWS)
[1-3]
examines
the intensity
fluctuations
of the speckle
pattern
to extract
dynamical
information
about
the scattering
sites.
When
many,
uncorrelated
scattering
sites
are present,
the electric
field
is a random
Gaussian
variable,
and the
dynamics
are easily
determined
from
the second
order
intensity
correlation
function
g(2).
g(2)(_) :
1 +
2
...(1)
g(2)(_) = 1 +
...(2)
This crucial
relation
relates
the measured
g(2) with
the electric
field auto-correlation
function
7(_),
which
can then be expressed
in terms
of the scattering
site dynamics.
It is not possible,
however,
to tell whether
the Gaussian
approximation
is valid
by inspection
of g(2) alone.
Recently,
a method
has been
developed
to test whether
the scattering
is Gaussian
by
measuring
higher
order
intensity
correlation
functions
[3].
In this
experiment
we measured
the
third
order
intensity
correlation
function
g(3) for
aqueous
foam
(Gillette
Foamy
Regular)
and
compared
it with the Gaussian
prediction
for g(3).
g(3) (_Cl,_c2):
1 +  1(1 01121 02121 1212)
+ 2132Re(701712720 )
...(3)
Preliminary
data indicate
that the scattering
is Gaussian
to sixth
order
in the electric
field.

ABSTRACT
Aqueous
foams
are composed
of gas bubbles
packed
together
in a small
volume
of soapy
water.
The
large
number
of
gas-liquid
interfaces
in foams
results
in very
strong
scattering
of
light,
which
explains
the opaque
nature
of conventional
aqueous
foams
such
as shaving
foams
and
mousse.
For
dry foams,
the
interfaces
can
take
the
following
three
forms
: the
soap
films
where
two
bubbles
meet,
the
triangular
plateau
borders
where
three
soap
films
meet
and
the
vertices
where
four plateau
borders
meet
[1 ]. Previous
experiments
have
shown
that most
of the
scattering
occurs
from
the plateau
borders
[2,3]
and the transport
mean
free path
of light
(1"), the
bubble
radius
(R) and the liquid
fraction
of foam
(E) is related
through
the relation
I*=R/E °5 [2].
To understand
the reflection
and scattering
of light
at the gas-bubble
interfaces,
we study
the
absorption
of photons
in the liquid
network
as a function
of the foam
absorptivity.
We do this to
confirm
if the time
spent
by the photons
in the liquid
phase
is proportional
to the liquid
fraction
of the foam.
Our results
indicate
that
for a specific
range
of liquid
fractions
(0.05
< _ < 0.1),
the
photons
seem
to get trapped
in the liquid
network.
This
result
is independent
of the absorptivity
of the foam
and leads
us to conclude
that under
appropriate
conditions,
an aqueous
foam
behaves
very much
like
an optical
fiber network.
Aqueous
foam
is generated
in the lab by the method
of turbulent
mixing
[4] of N2 gas with
a
jet of alpha-olefin-sulfonate
(AOS)
solution.
The foam
has been
made
absorbing
by dissolving
small
quantities
of rhodamine
dye ([R]
-- 0.005
g/l,
[R] -- 0.01
g/1 and
[R] -- 0.0124
g/l)
in the
AOS
solution.
The
transmission
of photons
through
the foams
of liquid
fractions
0.0297
< _ <
0.35
has been
studied
using
Diffuse
Transmission
Spectroscopy
(DTS).
For each
liquid
fraction,
the transport
mean
free path
1" (the length
over which
the photon
travels
before
it gets completely
randomized)
has
been
estimated
from
DTS
experiments
on
foams
with
[R]
-- 0.0
g/1. The
absorption
length
of
foams
(laf°am)
of various
absorptivities
has been
estimated
by fitting
the
transmission
vs. thickness
data to the formula
[5]

In Eqn.

length
ratio
(distance
outside
the sample,

of 1",

extrapolates

Fig.

a plot
of the ratio
laf°am/la
s°ln for the liquid
fraction
range
investigated,
for all
three
rhodamine
concentrations,
las°tn is the
absorption
length
of the pure
rhodamine
solution
estimated
using
transmission
measurements.
In the liquid
fraction
range
0.05
< E < 0.1, the ratio
is found
to be lower
than
the theoretical
prediction
(laf°am/la
s°ln _
i/g,
shown
by solid
line
in Fig.
1).
The
deviation
of
the
experimental
estimates
of laf°am/las°tn from
the
solid
line
leads
us
to
conclude
that
at 0.05
< E < 0.1,
the foam
behaves
like
an optical
fiber network
with the photons
getting
trapped
in and
then
channeled
through
the plateau
borders.
We believe
that
our results
may
be
explained
quantitatively
by relating
the reflectance
of light
at liquid-gas
and
gas-liquid
interfaces
to the average
angles
of incidence
at these
interfaces.

Fluid
physics
investigations
frequently
need
to measure
the
density
of
fluids
and
gases.
Ground
laboratories
typically
use
interferometry
for
such
measurements.
However,
interferometry
can
be
difficult
to employ
in reduced
gravity
laboratories
due
to both
the path
lengths
that are typically
required
and effects
of parasitic
vibrational
noise.
While
older
common
path
interferometers
are relatively
compact
and are more
immune
to vibration,
thus
overcoming
these
problems,
they
have
not
been
capable
of phase-shifting,
which
is required
for
the
most
accurate
data.
Recent
work
demonstrated
phase-shifting
common-path
interferometers
based
on
liquid
crystal
devices.1
However,
initial
interferometers
did not operate
at video
frame
rates
and
suffered
from
variations
in optical
density
with
applied
voltage.
The initial
focus
of this project
was
to eliminate
both
of these
problems
in the
Liquid
Crystal
Point-Diffraction
Interferometer
(LCPDI).
Progress
toward
that
goal
will be
described,
along
with
the demonstration
of a phase
shifting
Liquid
Crystal
Shearing
Interferometer
(LCSI)
that was developed
as part of this work.
Mercer,
Creath
and
Rashidnia
2 demonstrated
that
the
liquid
crystal
point
diffraction
interferometer
produced
data as accurate
as that generated
using
a Mach
Zehnder
interferometer.
While
accurate,
this
device
could
not
operate
at
video
frame
rates,
presented
alignment
difficulties
due to the large
number
of microspheres
used
as spacers
and suffered
from
voltage-
dependent
fluctuations
in optical
density.
Figure
1 is a photograph
of the latest
LCPDI.
Other
than
a lens
to focus
the light
from
a test
section
onto
a diffracting
microsphere
within
the
interferometer
and
a collimated
laser
for
illumination,
the
pink
region
contained
within
the glass
plates
on the rod-mounted
platform
is
the complete
interferometer.
The total
width
is
approximately
1.5 inches
with
0.25
inches
on
each
side
for bonding
the electrical
leads.
It is 1
inch
high
and
there
are
only
four
diffracting
microspheres
within
the
interferometer.
As
a
result,
it is very
easy
to align,
achieving
the first
goal.
The
liquid
crystal
electro-optical
response
time
is
a
function
of
layer
thickness,
with
thinner
devices
switching
faster
due
to
a
reduction
in long-range
viscoelastic
forces

between
the
LC molecules.
The
LCPDI
in Figure
1 has
a liquid
crystal
layer
thickness
of 10
microns,
which
is controlled
by plastic
or glass
microspheres
embedded
in epoxy
"pads"
at the
comers
of the
device.
The
diffracting
spheres
are composed
of polystyrene/divinyl
benzene
polymer
with
an
initial
diameter
of
15
microns.
The
spheres
deform
slightly
when
the
interferometer
is assembled
to conform
to the spacing
produced
by the microsphere-filled
epoxy
spacer
pads.
While
the speed
of this
interferometer
has not
yet been
tested,
previous
LCPDIs
fabricated
at the Laboratory
for Laser
Energetics
switched
at a rate
of approximately
3.3
Hz,
a
factor
of
10 slower
than
desired.
We
anticipate
better
performance
when
the
speed
of these
interferometers
is tested
since
they
are approximately
three
times
thinner.
Phase
shifting
in these
devices
is a function
of the AC
voltage
level
applied
to the
liquid
crystal.
As the voltage
increases,
the dye in the liquid
crystal
tends
to become
more
transparent,
thus
introducing
a rather
large
amount
of error
into the phase-shifting
measurement.
While
that
error
can be greatly
reduced
by normalization,
we prefer
eliminating
the source
of the error.
To
that
end,
we have
pursued
development
of a "blend"
of custom
dyes
that
will not
exhibit
these
properties.
That
goal
has
not
yet
been
fully
achieved
as
is
illustrated
by
the
set
of
five
interferograms
in Figure
2.
Guardalben,
et al, presented
a similar
set of interferograms
in a paper
partially
funded
by this grant. 3

of common
path
interferometers.
Typically
they
consist
of a thick
glass
plate
optimized
for
equal
reflection

the
front
and
back
surface.
While
not
part
of the
original
thrust
of the project,
through
the
course

work,
we

INTRODUCTION
AND
MOTIVATION
Foams
are extremely
important
in a variety
of industrial
applications.
They
are widely
used
in
firefighting
applications,
in flow
applications
such
as enhanced
oil
recovery,
and
as trapping,
transport
and
separation
agents.
The
most
important
quality
of
a foam
in
many
of
these
industrial
processes
is its response
to imposed
strain,
or its rheological
behavior.
There
exists
little
experimental
data
on
the
rheological
properties
of
real
3D
foams,
even
though
such
knowledge
would
likely
enhance
the efficacy
of current
applications
and
suggest
other
unique
applications.
The lack of 3D data is due in large
part to the earth-based
requirements
for contact
containment,
and to the fact
that
gravity-induced
drainage
quickly
destroys
all but
the
"driest"
foams,
those
with a very
high gas volume
fraction
C_g. We introduce
a unique
method
to provide
non-contact
control
and manipulation
of foam
samples.
The development
of this technique
will
provide
the ability
to carry
out a set of benchmark
experiments
in 0g allowing
determination
of a
foam's
yield
stress,
bulk
shear
and dilatational
moduli
and viscosities
as a continuous
function
of
gas volume
(or
'void')
fraction
C_gfrom
the dry limit
(C_g _
1) through
the order-disorder
phase
transition
to the wet limit
(C_g(_ 1) of a bubbly
liquid.
OBJECTIVES
The goal of the
of foams,
utilizing
exist,
or only exist
investigation
is the determination
of the mechanical
and rheological
properties
the microgravity
environment
to explore
foam
theology
for foams
that
cannot
for a short
time,
in lg.
The
specific
objectives
of the investigation
are:
1)
To
refine
and
utilize
a
novel,
non-contact
acoustic
technique
for
experimentally
measuring
the stress-response
of small
samples
of foam
("foam
drops")
subjected
to both
static
and time-varying
acoustic
strain.
2)
To experimentally
measure
the stress-response
of foam
drops
subjected
to both
static
and
time-varying
strain.
3)
To
model
the
response
of
foam
drops
to
static
and
time-varying
modulation
of
the
acoustic
field
to extract
rheological
properties.
4)
To define
experiments
that can be performed
in the _tg environment,
where
the effects
of
drainage,
buoyancy
and
high
acoustic
fields
can
be
avoided,
and
C_gcan
be
varied
smoothly
through
the order-disorder
transition.
RESULTS
Our
ground-based
investigations
have
concentrated
on
the
investigation
and
analysis
of
normal-mode
oscillations
of foam
drops.
We can organize
the presentation
of our results
to date
by void
fraction:
Dry
limit,
effective
medium
model.
In the limit
of dry foams
(void
fraction
greater
than
the
critical
value,
and approaching
unity)
and small
deformations
from
equilibrium,
we model
foam
as
an
effective
elastic
solid
medium.
In
[1]
we
present
a model
for
the
normal
modes
of
oscillation
of an effective
elastic
sphere.
By specifying
(via measurement)
the natural
frequency
of
a specific
mode
we
may
infer
the
effective
shear
elastic
modulus
G of
the
foam
via
the
formula
(_R

wherep
is the
effective
density
of the

co is the
measured
modal
frequency,
R
is the
measured
drop
radius,
_ is the computed
dimensionless
modal
frequency
from
the model,
and
v
is Poisson's
ratio
for the foam.
Results
for a drop
with void fraction
of 0.8 yielded
a shear modulus
G = 75 _+3 Pa, which
is of
the same
order
as several
estimates
of the shear
modulus
of foams
reported
in the literature
using
contact-based
techniques.
Importantly,
this
result
was
insensitive
to the
foam's
Poisson
ratio,
which
is difficult
to independently
measure.
Wet
limit,
bubble
dynamics
model.
In
the
limit
of
'low'
void
fractions
(roughly
0.5
and
below)
we
model
foam
as a bubbly
liquid.
In [2] we
develop
a model
for the
dynamics
of a
spherical
drop
of such
a foam
which
retains
fully
nonlinear
behavior
of individual
bubbles.
The
primary
advantage
of this bubble-based
model
is that it has predictive
power.
In the
limit
of
linear,
inviscid
motion
we
obtain
approximate
analytic
expressions
for
the
normal
mode
frequencies
of a spherical
foam
drop
of equilibrium

MICROGRAVITY
RELEVANCE
AND
SIGNIFICANCE
All but
the driest
foams
drain
in gravity.
The
liquid
component
will flow
downward,
and the
bubbles
will rise until
a pool
of liquid
with
a dry foam
cap will form.
Gravity
will thus
prevent
the measurement
of foam
properties
as the gas volume
fraction
is decreased
towards
the order-
disorder
transition,
because
the foam
will be destroyed.
There
is very
little
experimental
data on
the
rheological
properties
of 3D
foams,
primarily
because
potential
experiments
are
severely
hindered
by the requirement
for contact
containment,
and draining
and thinning
due to gravity.
Our
experimental
technique
can
provide
non-contact
control
and
manipulation
of
multicomponent
and multiphase
drops.
In comparison
with
existing
experimental
techniques
for
rheological
measurements,
our technique
offers
at least
four
advantages.
First,
it is a non-contact
technique
that
can
nevertheless
provide
stable
positioning
and
straining
manipulation
of
a
sample.
Second,
we can easily
levitate
and strain
samples
of arbitrary
void fraction
continuously
from
0 to 1.
Third,
we can test
small
samples
of foam
with
variable
number
and size of bubbles
to investigate
limiting
cases.
Finally,
we can
simultaneously
measure
shear
and compressional
parameters,
whereas
traditional
techniques
are restricted
to either
of these.

R.A.
Bagnold
published
his
seminal
findings
on the
rheological
properties
of
liquid-solid
flows.
Over
the
last
fifty
years,
this
work
has
been
cited
extensively
in
studies
of granular
and
debris
flows,
sedimentation,
suspensions,
magma
flows,
sand
transport
and
a range
of
other
multiphase
flow
processes.
We
recently
completed
an
extensive
reevaluation
of
Bagnold's
work
(Hunt,
et
al.
2002)
and
our
analysis
and
simulations
indicate
that
the
rheological
measurements
of
Bagnold
were
affected
significantly
by
secondary
flows
within
the
experimental
apparatus.
The
concentric
cylinder
rheometer
was
designed
by
Bagnold
to measure
simultaneously
the
shear
and
normal
forces
for a wide
range
for solid
concentrations,
fluid
viscosities
and shear
rates.
As presented
by Bagnold,
the shear
and normal
forces
depended
linearly
on the shear
rate
in the
"macroviscous'
regime.
As the
grain-to-grain
interactions
increased
in the
"grain
inertia'
regime,
the
stresses
depended
on
the
square
of
the
shear
rate
and
were
independent
of the
fluid
viscosity.
These
results,
however,
appear
to be
dictated
by the
design
of
the
experimental
facility.
In
Bagnold's
experiments,
the
height
(h)
of
the
rheometer
was relatively
short
compared
to the spacing
(t) between
the rotating
outer
and
stationary
inner
cylinder
(h/t=-4.6).
Since
the top
and bottom
end plates
rotated
with
the
outer
cylinder,
the flow
contained
two
axisymmetric
counter-rotating
cells
in which
flow
moved
outward
along
the
end plates
and inward
at the midheight
of the annulus.
These
cells
contribute
significantly
to
the
measured
torque,
and
obscured
any
accurate
measurements
of the shear
or normal
stresses.
Before
doing
the reevaluation
of Bagnold's
work,
our research
objective
was
to examine
the effects
of the interstitial
fluid
for flows
in which
the densities
of the two phases
were
different.
In Bagnold's
original
work,
only neutrally
buoyant
spheres
were
used.
Because
of the questions
that we have
raised
regarding
Bagnold's
measurements,
the scope
of our
work
can be expanded
because
issues
associated
with
neutrally
buoyant
particles
as well
as flows
of dissimilar
densities
are of considerable
scientific
interest
and there
appears
to
be no
corresponding
experimental
measurements.
The
reduced-gravity
environment
on
the
KC135
aircraft
will
enable
the
measurements
of particles
of mismatched
without
having
a separation
of the two phases.

After
reevaluating
Bagnold's
work,
we redesigned
our experimental
facility
to minimize
secondary
flow
effects.
Like
Bagnold's
facility,
we use
a concentric
cylinder
rheometer
with
a rotating
outer
wall.
The inner
cylinder
also is able to rotate
slightly
but will also be
restrained
by
flexible
supports;
the
torque
is measured
from
the
deformation
of
the
flexures.
The normal
force
is measured
using
piezoelectric
transducers
that
record
both
impacts
with
the
surface
and
fluid
pressure
variations
resulting
from
particle
collisions.
Unlike
Bagnold's
apparatus,
the top and bottom
plates
of the annulus
will not rotate,
and
the torque
measurement
will be measured
only
in the center
region
of the inner
annulus;
these
changes
will minimize
the secondary
flow
effects.
The
experiments
will
cover
a range
of particle
sizes
(from
d = 1.5 to 4 mm),
particle
concentrations
(up to 55%
solids
concentration
by volume),
shear
rates
(7 = 10-160
sec -1)
and
solid-to-fluid
densities
(pp = 1.2
to 8).
During
one
flight
of
the
KC-135
we
will
change
two
parameters:
the
rotational
speed
and
the
fluid
viscosity
(/2). At
one
time
during
a flight,
we
plan
to withdraw
some
of the fluid
(water
for
example)
within
the
annulus
while
injecting
some
fluid
of
a different
viscosity
(water-glycerin
mixture).
Hence,
the
experiments
will
cover
flows
where
the particle
inertia
dominates
the
fluid
effects
(granular
flows)
to flows
in which
the fluid
inertia
dominates
that
of the particles
(dilute
suspension).
The range
of Stokes
numbers
(St=d27pj/2)
will
be from
about
5 to
3000.
Currently,
the
experimental
facility
has
just
been
completed.
We
have
calibrated
the
normal
impact
measurements
using
carefully
controlled
single
particle
impacts
with
the
transducers.
The torque
measurements
have
also
been
calibrated
by mounting
the
inner
cylinder
in such
a way
that
we
could
impose
a known
load
on
the
drum.
We
use
reluctance
transducers
to
measure
the
motion
and
deformation
of
the
flexures
and
calibrate
the device
with
the imposed
load.
Measurements
will
also
be made
of the fluid
temperature,
acceleration
and rotational
speed
of the outer
drum.
The
poster
will
overview
the
current
status
of
our
experiment
and
the
planned
experimental
program.

ABSTRACT
Dust
grains
immersed
in plasma
discharges
acquire
a large
negative
charge
and settle
into
a
dust
cloud
at the edge
of the sheath.
In this region,
the plasma
ions
stream
toward
the electrode
at a velocity
u
~
Cs=(Te/mi)
1/2.
Experimentally
at sufficiently
high
gas pressure
P, the random
kinetic
energy
of the grains
is damped
by gas friction,
and the grains
are strongly
coupled
and
self-organize
into
a crystalline
configuration
[1-3].
For
lower
pressures
despite
the dissipation
of grain
kinetic
energy
to gas friction,
the dust
grains
reach
a steady-state
kinetic
temperature
Td which
is much
larger
than
the temperature
of any other
component
in the plasma.
Td is so large
that
the dust
acts like
a fluid
[1-3].
We
have
used
the
dynamically
shielded
dust
(DSD)
model
[4]
to
simulate
these
physical
processes.
We find that
the known
experimental
features
are
nicely
reproduced
in
the
simulations,
and
that
additional
features
are
revealed.
In
the figure
we plot
the variation
of Td as P is continuously
varied
in a DSD
code
run.
A marked
difference
is evident

between
the
critical
pressure
Pm for
the melting
transition
as
P is decreased,
and
the
critical
pressure
Pc for the condensation
transition
as P is increased.
For Pm < P < Pc, mixed
phase
states
are seen.
This
hysteresis
occurs
because
the instability
which
triggers
melting
is different
from
the instability
that heats
the dust in the fluid phase
and inhibits
freezing.
CONDENSATION:
At low pressure,
the dust is subject
to a two-stream
instability
with
the ions.
This instability
is responsible
for the high
temperature
of the dust at low pressure.
For further
details
we refer
the reader
to Ref [4].
MELTING:
The basic
physics
underlying
the melting
transition
has been
elucidated
in a series
of papers
[2,5,6].
In Refs
[2,5]
a phenomenological
model
for the asymmetric
interaction
between
grains
is constructed.
We are developing
a first-principles
analytic
approach
to the
melting
transition,
which
embodies
the same
physics
that
is present
in the DSD
code.
The inter-
grain
potential
is the dynamically
shielded
Coulomb
interaction,

where
D(k,co)
is the linear
plasma

function

in Refs
[4,7].
Crystal
instabilities
can
be represented
at various
levels
of detail.
Experiments
and
DSD
simulations
indicate
that
the
mode
which
initiates
the
melting
process
is a shear
mode
with
propagation
vector
k parallel
to the ion streaming.
In the linear
stage
of this mode,
the equation

grain
layers,
and Ax is the
displacement
of
the
grain
from
its
equilibrium
position
in the
x direction
(transverse
to the
propagation
direction
z). Unlike
the situation
in ordinary
crystals,
the force
constants
C ÷ are such
that
C÷ veC-.
For a transverse
mode
in an infinite
crystal,
Axj ~ exp[i(jkd-mt)],
Eq. (3) leads
to a

Eq.
(5) is similar
to the dispersion
relation
for phonons
in an ordinary
crystal,
except
that
here
instability
occurs
because
C ÷ ve C-.
The
instability
can be
stabilized
at high
pressure
due to the
dust
collisionality
Vd and/or
the ion collisionality
vi, which
appears
as damping
of the attractive
wake
force
C
through
the dielectric
D in Eq. (2).
The phonon
streaming
instability
is similar
to
the two-stream
instability
that occurs
in the fluid-dust
phase.
However,
the stabilization
pressure
Pm for the phonon
instability
is lower
than
the critical
pressure
Pc for Buneman
instability
(i.e. for
freezing),
as indicated
by the DSD
code
results.
There
is a range
of pressures
where
both
the
solid
and
fluid
phases
of the
dust
are
stable,
which
allows
a mixed-phase
system
to exist,
as
observed
[2].

Experimental

of turbulence-induced

in
aerosols

Abstract
An
aerosol
consists
of a dispersion
of liquid
particles
in a gas.
Coalescence
occurs
when
Brownian
motion,
differential
sedimentation
or turbulent
gas
flow drive
two
drops
into
con-
tact
and
the drops
fbrm
a larger
drop.
Coalescence
modifies
the
size distribution
of an aerosol
which
in turn
affects
its
main
properties.
For
instance,
raindrop
coalescence
play
an impor-
tant
role in cloud
dynamics,
precipitation
and
the
scavenging
of pollutants
by precipitation.
The
rate
of coalescence
depends
on the forces
driving
the
relative
motion
of the
particles.
A good
fundamental
understanding
of the
mechanisms
of coalescence
leading
to quantitative
predictions
of coalescence
rates
has
been
achieved
for colloidal
particles
suspended
in liquids.
This
achievement
is largely
attributable
to
the
ability
of researchers
to isolate
each
of the
driving
fbrces
in turn
by judicious
use
of the
density
matching
of the
fluid
and
particles
and
adjustment
of the
fluid
viscosity.
In
contrast,
the
current
understanding
of aerosol
coalescence
is rudimentary.
Moreover,
in
experimental
conditions
on
Earth,
one
is likely
to observe
mixed
effects
of Brownian
motion,
sedimentation
and
turbulence
on coalescence
making
a critical
test
of theory
difficult.
W_ present
an experimental
ground-based
study
of aerosol
coalescence
due to turbulence.
It will provide
the
necessary
background
to plan
a microgravity
experiment
on aerosol
coa-
lescence.
An
initially
nearly
monodisperse
aerosol
with
high
particle
number
density
(typically
106particles/cm
3) is produced
using
a Condensation
Monodisperse
Aerosol
Generator
(TSI
3475).
It flows
continuously
through
a plexiglass
cell where
it experiences
a turbulent
flow
field
generated
by
an
oscillating
grid
(see
Figure
1).
The
initial
size
distribution
is
then
modified
due
to turbulence-induced
coalescence.
Using
droplets
with
an
initial
mean
diameter
of 3 /_m,
we
maximize
the
importance
of
turbulence
on
coalescence
relative
to
Brownian
motion
(important
fbr
smaller
particles)
and
sedimentation
(important
fbr larger
particles).
To be able to compare
experimental
data
on turbulence-induced
coagulation
with
theory,
a precise
description
of the
turbulent
flow
field
is necessary.
It
has
been
characterized
by
measuring
the
velocity
fluctuations
using
a laser
Doppler
velocimetry
technique
(a typical
result
is shown
in Figure
2).
The
turbulent
kinetic
energy
is fbund
to be
constant
in the
central
region
of the cell (within
a distance
away
from
the grid
mean
position
equal
to half the
stroke
of the grid
displacement)
and then
to decay
away
from
the grid.
Our results
are similar
to which
one
expects,
based
on previous
experiments
in liquids.
In order
to characterize
the
coalescence,
the
particle
size
distribution
is measured
in situ
using
a Particle
Dynamics
Analyser.
This
technique
is based
on the
analysis
of the
light
scattered
by the
particles
as
they
cross
a volume
of measurement
defined
by
the
intersection
of two
laser
beams.

size
distribution
being
known,
the

can
be
measured
using

As
already
mentioned,
the
extent
to
which
we
can
isolate
turbulence
from
the
other
mechanisms
that
may
lead
to coagulation
is limited
and
this
fbrms
the
motivation
for the
future
microgravity
experiments.
Under
microgravity,
we will
be
able
to use
substantially
larger
particles
and
eliminate
Brownian
motion
without
introducing
effbcts
of sedimentation.
However,
this
ground-based
experiment
will
demonstrate
the
validity
of our
experimental
methods
to characterize
the
coalescence.

NON STEADY
STATE GRANULAR
SHEAR
FLOWS

ABSTRACT
We experimentally
investigate
the shear
flow
of granular
matter
in a cylindrical
Couette
cell.
Since
granular
flows
dissipate
energy,
they
must
be continuously
driven
to remain
in a flowing
state.
Previous
experiments
on steady
state
shear
flows
have
found
that
velocity
gradients
are
confined
to a thin
shear
band,
and that the shear
force
is roughly
independent
of shear
rate if the
material
is allowed
to dilate 1'2.
Our
experiments
in a Couette
geometry
focus
on two
related
questions
about
non-steady
state
flows:
1)
How
does
a granular
shear
flow
start? 3
2)
How
does
a granular
system
respond
to oscillatory
shear?
In
particular,
we
investigate
the
role
of
boundary
conditions,
which
we
expect
to be
of
particular
importance,
since
granular
flows
must
be
continuously
driven
(in
general
from
a
boundary)
in order
to be
sustained.
In our
Couette
cell
a shear
flow
is generated
by moving
either
the inner
cylinder
or the outer
cylinder
or both
cylinders.
The
motion
of grains
on the top
surface
is measured
directly
with
fast imaging
and particle
tracking
techniques.
Previous
studies
have
indicated
that the velocity
profile
on the top surface
is
very
similar
to the
velocity
profile
within
the bulk.
Measurements
of the
corresponding
shear
forces
are in progress.
Initial
experiments
determined
the
steady
state
flow
profiles
under
different
driving
conditions,
with
either
inner,
outer
or both
cylinders
moving.
In steady
state,
velocity
gradients
are confined
to a roughly
exponential
shearband
several
particle
diameters
wide.
The shear
band
is always
located
at the
inner
cylinder.
A probable
reason
for
this
observation
is the
slightly
smaller
surface
area
of the inner
cylinder
compared
to the outer
cylinder.
Since
shear
forces
are
transmitted
from
one cylinder
to the other,
the smaller
surface
area of the inner
cylinder
leads
to
larger
shear
stresses.
Shear
flow
confined
to
regions
of
high
stress
can
be
reproduced
in
continuum
mechanics

models,
or locally

models
that include

dependence
of viscosity.
Most
of these
models
are isotropic
with
respect
to the shear
direction.
However,
anisotropies
manifest
themselves
in two
distinct
flow
transients,
when
rotation
of one
of the
cylinders
is
started.
When
the cylinder
had been
rotated
in the same
direction
before,
the thin

band
immediately
forms.
When
the previous
motion
of the cylinder
had been
in the opposite
direction,
particles
far from
the moving
cylinder
are initially
more
mobile.
After
an extra
displacement
of
up to six particle
diameters,
a thin
shearband
forms
again
in steady
state.
The extra
displacement
of particles
far from
the shear
surface
does
not strongly
depend
on the shear rate prior
or after the
stop,
solely
on the
direction
of prior
shear.
This
indicates
that

after
a shear
flow
exhibits
anisotropies.
The
flow
transient,
at least,
can
then
no longer
be
modeled
with the isotropic
form
of the models
described
above.
Finally,
we investigate
oscillatory
shear
flow.
During
small
amplitude
oscillations
the shear
flow
is confined
to a thin
shear
band.
In addition,
a gradual
compaction
and strengthening
of the
granular
material
is observed.
For
sufficiently
large oscillation
amplitudes,
the flow
resembles
a
sequence
of shear
reversals.
In oscillatory
flows
driven
by the outer
cylinder,
coexistence
of
shearbands
at the outer
and inner
cylinder
can be found.
In summary,
we have
elucidated
important
properties
of granular
shear
flows
from
non-steady
state
flow
measurements:
First,
shear
bands
form
preferentially
near
the
inner
cylinder,
even
when
the outer
cylinder
is sheared.
Transiently
a shear band
can also form
near
the outer
cylinder
during
oscillatory
driving.
These
observations
should
help refine
models
of granular
shear
flow.
One
challenge
in improving
models
of granular
shear
flow
is the observation
that
the initial
flow
transient
contains
"memory"
of
the
direction
of
previously
applied
shear.
In
order
to
incorporate
this observation
into flow
models,
the nature
of the anisotropy
requires
further
study.
Currently
we
are investigating
the three
dimensional
configuration
of grains
during
the start
of
shear
flow
using
confocal
microscopy.

The role of triboelectrostatic
charges
on granular
materials
was tested
on USML-1
and USML-2,
as well as on
several
KC-135
flights
/1/.
The
goal
of these
experiments
was
to
determine
how
static
electricity
affects
the
aggregation
of particles
in natural
settings
such
as
volcanic
eruptions,
dust
storms
on earth
and
Mars,
and
protoplanetary
nebulae
/2/.
Knowledge
so gained
would
also have
relevance
to industrial
processing
of a wide
variety
of granular
materials
(powdered
coal,
cement,
grain,
pharmaceuticals,
etc.).
The USML
flights
repeatedly
demonstrated
the existence
of electrostatic
polarizing
forces
that universally
created
filamentary
aggregates
from
tribocharged
(dielectric)
grains
released
into a microgravity
chamber.
This polarizing
force
is considered
to be an
electrostatic
dipole
created
by the random
distribution
of both
positive
and negative
charges
on each grain/3/.
A
discrete
dipole
moment
on a grain
is not to the exclusion
of net charge
(an imbalance
of the charge
mixture).
In
microgravity,
the dipoles
are able to rotate
the grains
so that they are always in a mutually
attractive
orientation
with
respect
to their nearest
neighbor
grains;
the result is the end-to-end
stacking
of grains that forms chains
or filaments
(ranging
between
2 and 20 grains per chain for grains
of about 400 microns
diameter).
Tribocharging
of the grains
in
the USML
experiments
was accomplished
by a forceful
compressed
air pulse injection
into the experiment
chambers,
thereby
permitting
aggregation
to occur while the grains
were
still mobile.
After grain
motion
ceased,
aggregation
continued
only for a few minutes,
and then reached
a stable inactive
equilibrium
phase
lasting
for the remainder
of
the experiment
duration
of up to 30 minutes.
These
USML
data formed
the basis
for proceeding
to the Space
Station experiment
"Electrostatics
of Granular
Materials"
(EGM),
originally
slated for a 2004
deployment,
but now in stasis,
with the exception
of ground
based
studies
that
continue
to
hone
our understanding
of electrostatic
phenomena.
EGM
would
attempt
to provide
unequivocal
proof
of the
dipoles
while
quantifying
their
properties.
As part
of EGM
development,
laboratory
investigations
were conducted
on the tribocharging
of various
candidate
flight
samples.
The goal of the tests was to
determine
the extent
of net charging
in granular
populations
as an indicator
of the charge
levels that would need to be
measured
on
Space
Station.
It
was
also
important
to
determine
if tribocharging
could
be
achieved
with
a
"conservation
of charge"
within
a given
tribocharging
apparatus.
This
conservation
idea
derives
from
a modeled
concept
in which
positive
charges
are created
on one
surface
as a result
of transferring
electrons
to an adjacent
surface:
charge
exchange
should
theoretically
generate
an equal number
of positive
and negative
charges
so that the
system as a whole
remains
neutral
(dipoles
would be present,
even with net neutrality
of the grain population).
The
laboratory
device
used for tribological
experiments
consisted
of a cylindrical
glass
vessel
with an air jet
impinging
upon
particles
within
the
vessel.
Particulate
material
was
caused
to
continually
circulate
while
the
impelling
air escaped
through
a diffuser/screen
system.
Typical
circulation/collision
speeds
of grains
were mm/sec
to
several
m/s.
Electrostatic
charge
in the system
was determined
from
a hand-held
electrometer
(ACL Model
300B)
positioned
~ 2 cm from
the vessel's
outer
wall at 90 degrees
orthogonally
from
the air jet. The
electrometer
was
designed
for detecting
patch
charges
on surfaces
in clean rooms.
The analog readout
is calibrated
for fixed distances
from surfaces,
and it is assumed
that the meter was reading
the electrical
field emanating
from a surface
charge
that
has a magnitude
equal
to the reading,
presumably
with
respect
to ground.
The charge
registered
near the vessel
includes
contributions
from both vessel
walls and grains
inside the vessel.
If the system had a charge
balance
--i.e.
the grain charging
was equal and opposite
to that of the vessel,
the measured
charge
would sum to zero. This was not
the case --large
net charges
were observed,
but the cause is undetermined.
Positive
charge
could have leaked through
the vessel
support
structure,
via leakage
to air, or in some cases, via transport
on comminution
fines vented
from the
system.
Quartz,
glass,
and
plastic
grains
have
been
tested.
These
are candidate
materials
for
EGM,
although
for
convenience,
larger
grain
sizes than those planned
for EGM
(~300 micron)
were used in the lab tests.
All samples
being agitated
by the air resulted
in negative
charge readings
where
the electrometer
was located
near the base of the
vessel,
with the grains
charging
positive
in some cases, negative
in others
(as measured
by inserting
the electrometer
into the vessel).
With all materials,
and all grain sizes (ranging
from several hundred
microns
to several millimeters),

Ironically,
the
more
dispersed
a system is, the more
effective
the dipole and monopole
effects
become
(especially
in low or zero gravity
environments)
because
grain orientation
is facilitated,
but at the same time, the dispersion
leads to fewer contacts
per
unit time,
thus reducing
the magnitude
of the charges
(recalling
the rapidity
of charge
decay during
the interval
between
tribological
contacts).
Secondly,
the discovery
of charge
behavior
in relation
to tribological
action
adds a new and
very
significant
enhancement
to EGM
science.
Since
charge
decay can be very rapid
with rates
being
highly
material-dependent,
charge
cannot
be regarded
as a constant,
and it is obviously
a variable
warranting
investigation.
We have added some
new procedures
to EGM --with very little additional
effort, we will be able to shed light on the "non-static"
nature
of
static electricity.
It will be especially
important
to see how these high net charges
relate to the dipole,
and what their
relative
decay rates are. The fact that grains
were
"always
attractive"
in USML
(during
the same period
when high
tribological
net charges
were being actively
developed)
suggests
that the dipole is commensurably
powerful
with the
monopole.
It will also be instructive
to ascertain
these measurements
in a microgravity
environment
where grains
are
suspended,
and thus unable to lose charge
by contact
with other grains,
or via the vessel
walls.

ABSTRACT
Studies
of dynamic
wetting
phenomena
and
contact
angle
measurements
frequently
involve
either
visual
or mathematical
extrapolations
of the macroscopic
interfaces
due to the
difficulties
inherent
in quantitatively
measuring
the
microscopic
fluid
physics
that
arise
near
the
moving
contact
line.
We have
developed
a phase-shifted
laser feedback
interferometer
(psLFI)
that
can be
used
to rapidly
and
non-invasively
measure
the
interfacial
profile
in the
vicinity
of
moving
contact
lines of simple
Newtonian
and complex
fluids
[1-2].
The
test
fluids
used
in the
present
study
are constant-viscosity
silicone
oils
(Gelest
Inc.)
which
perfectly
wet the smooth
silicon
substrate.
The viscosities
are varied
from
7 </t
<
10 4 cSt
in order to explore
a wide
range of capillary
numbers,
Ca = faUltY
(here
cr is the surface
tension
and
U is
the
steady
spreading
velocity).
For
wetting
systems
(in
which
the
liquid
spreads
spontaneously
to give
a nominally
zero
contact
angle)
a precursor
or primary
film moves
ahead
of the main
body of liquid
[3]. When
the disjoining
pressures
are large and the viscosity
small,
the
precursor
films
may
spread
quite
rapidly
for
significant
distances
ahead
of
the
bulk
fluid.
A
simplifying
feature
of
wetting
via
a precursor
film
is that
the
motion
of
the
bulk
liquid
is
decoupled
from
the
wetting
line,
hence
the
liquid
may
be
considered
to
spread
across
a pre-
wetted
surface.
The hydrodynamic
equations
yield
a velocity
dependence
of the apparent
contact
angle
that
follows
a simple
power
law for Ca <<1 given
by 0a ~ Ca 1/3(Tanner's
law)
[4]. Here
0a
is the apparent
dynamic
contact
angle.
A syringe
pump
delivers
a precise
volume
of liquid
onto
a clean
silicon
substrate.
During
the
spreading
process,
the
psLFI
system
is focused
on the
substrate
in front
of
the
moving
wetting
line
as shown
in the Fig.
1 and the spreading
film
flows
past
the
approximately
1 gm
diameter
spot
focused
by the high
numerical
aperature
objective
lens.
In order
to estimate
the
optical
path
length
(OPL)
and interference
fringe
visibility,
the intensity
of the laser
is monitored
in real-time
and discrete
phase
shifts
are introduced
using
an electro-optic
modulator
(EOM);
this
process
is automated
using
Labview.
From
the OPL data we can follow
the evolution
of the local
thickness
of the
drop,
h(x),
as a function
of time.
In Fig. 2 we show
an example
of the
psLFI
oresponse
close
to the wetting
line.
The left vertical
axis shows
the drop
profile
h(x)
[in nm]
as a
function
of the
lateral
position
x
[in
_m].
The
right-hand
axis
shows
the
interference
fringe
visibility,
m. The
polished
silicon
substrate
has
a high visibility
(m -0.095)
however
this
drops
suddenly
about
100 gm before
the apparent
or macroscopic
contact
line passes
the measurement

point.
In
this
offset
region
a very
thin
liquid
film
(-100
nm)
can
be
detected
in front
of
the
contact
line.
The
length
of this
precursor
film,
Lp,
is measured
from
the
position
where
the
visibility
drops
to the position
where
the
drop
thickness
starts
to increase
rapidly.
A series
of
measurements
over
a wide
range
of
(Newtonian)
fluid
viscosities
and
spreading
velocities
are
shown
in Fig.
3. The
lateral
extent
of
this
precursor
layer
varies
inversely
with
Ca
and
is in
excellent
agreement
with the theoretical
prediction,
Lp = _SA/6rccr
2 Ca -1 where
S is the spreading
coefficient
andA
is the Hamaker
constant
[4]. We
are currently
using
this
technique
to image
the
spatio-temporal
evolution
of the shape
of the 'foot'
in more
complex
fluids
such
as Xanthan
gum
(a rigid rod polymer),
flexible
polymer
solutions
and also highly
entangled
polymer
melts.

ABSTRACT
The
formation
of droplets
is an
important
phenomenon
in many
industrial
applications
as
well
as an interesting
and
challenging
physical
problem.
Many
of these
processes
involve
the
formation
of
droplets
from
particle-laden
liquids
including
ink-jet
printing
technology,
fuel
combustion,
and
spray
drying
operations.
This
work
investigates
how
the
presence
of
solid
particles
in a suspending
liquid
affects
the droplet
formation
process.
Droplet
formation
from
pure
liquids
has
been
extensively
studied
both
experimentally
and
numerically
and is fairly
well
understood.
However,
little
information
is available
concerning
the
process
for
solid-liquid
suspensions.
Experiments
to date
have
investigated
the
formation
of
pendant
drops
of
suspensions
of
varying
particle
volume
fraction
(q_) into
both
a
second
immiscible
liquid
and into ambient
air.
For
each
case the thread
length
achieved
at pinch-off
and
the resulting
drop
size are measured
and the effect
of increasing
q_observed.
The
results
of
these
experiments
which
illustrate
the
particle
effects
most
clearly
are the
qualitative
characteristics
of the structure
developed
during
the necking
and subsequent
pinch-off
of the drop.
For low particle
concentration
(typically
up to q__ 0.10)
the structure
observed
near
pinch-off
is the
asymmetrical
"needle-sphere"
combination
described
by Peregrine
et al (JFM
212,
25 (1990))
for pure
fluids.
At larger
particle
fractions
the structure
observed
near
pinch-off
becomes
significantly
different
and the forming
droplet
has a less spherical,
pear-like
shape.
This
shape
is similar
to that
observed
by Shi et al (Science
265,
219
(1994))
for increasingly
viscous
pure fluids
and can lead to pinch-off
occurring
in a more
variable
manner
at a location
away from
the
edge
of the
forming
drop.
Simple
rheological
arguments
based
on the
effective
viscosity
increase
with
q_fail to explain
these
qualitative
changes
in the drop
structure
In addition
to studying
the case
where
purely
pendant
drops
are formed
at the orifice
exit,
this
work
also
seeks
to
understand
how
particles
affect
the
process
after
jetting
has
occurred.
Understanding
the flow
behavior
in this
regime
is critical
to any practical
application
involving
the use
of particle-laden
liquids.
With
this
aim,
experiments
are in progress
to investigate
the
transition
from
pendant
to jetting
droplet
formation
behavior,
focusing
on how
the presence
of
solid
particles
in the liquid
affect
this transition.
Future
work
will
continue
these
efforts
with
a
focus
on
expanding
these
initial
experiments
towards
smaller
scales,
seeking
to determine
the
generality
of the influence
of suspended
particles.

ABSTRACT
Avalanches
and landslides
are among
the most dramatic
of natural catastrophes,
and they
also
provide
an evocative
metaphor
for a wide range
of propagating
breakdown
phenomena.
On the other
hand,
the existence
of avalanches,
i.e. the sudden
collapse
of the system
previously
frozen into a high
energy
state, is a fundamental
manifestation
of the metastable
nature
of
granular
materials.
Studies
of
avalanches
and surface
flows
in granular
media
have largely
focused
on dry grains.
By wetting
such
media,
however,
one
inlroduces
controllable
adhesive
forces
between
the
grains
which
lead
to
qualitatively
new
behavior.
In our previous
work,
we identified
three fundamental
regimes
for the
repose
angle
of wet granular
materials
as a function
of the liquid content.
The granular
regime
at very
low
liquid
contents
is
dominated
by
the
motion
of
individual
grains;
in
the
correlated
regime
corresponding
to intermediate
liquid
contents,
a rough
surface
is formed
by the flow
of
separated
clumps;
and
the
repose
angle
of very
wet
samples
results
from
cohesive
flow
with
viscoplastic
properties.
Here
we
report
investigations
of the avalanche
dynamics
and
flow
properties
of wet
granular
materials,
employing
a rotating
drum
apparatus (a cylindrical
chamber
partly
filled
with
a granular
medium
and rotated around a horizontal
axis).
At low rotation
rates, the medium
remains
at rest relative
to the drum while its surface angle is slowly
increased
by rotation,
up to a critical angle
0max where an
avalanche
occurs,
thus
decreasing
the
surface
angle
to
the
repose
angle
Or. The
flow
becomes
continuous
at high
rotation
rates,
but
the
transition
between
avalanching
and
continuous
flow
is
hysteretic
in rotation
rote in dry media.
Previous
studies of cohesive
granular
media in a rotating drum
have focused
on the surface
angles
of the medium
before
and after avalanches.
In our measurements,
we focus instead
on characterizing
the dynamics
of cohesive
flow.
We quantitatively
investigate
the
flow
dynamics
dttring
avalanches
at different
liquid
contents
by analyzing
the time
evolution
of the
averaged
surface
profile
obtained
from
hundreds
of avalanche
events,
and we also measure
surface
velocities
during
continuous
flow.
In
particular,
we
explore
the nature
of the
viscoplastic
flow,
(observed
at the highest
liquid
contents)
in which
there
are lasting
contacts
during
flow,
leading
to
coherence
across
the entire
sample.
This coherence
leads to a velocity
independent
flow depth
at high
rotation
rates and novel robust pattern
formation
in the granular
surface.

ABSTRACT
The
motion
of a solid
object
being
pulled
slowly
through
a granular
medium
is resisted
by
jamming
of the grains,
resulting
in a drag
force
which
differs
dramatically
from
viscous
drag in a
fluid
both
in its average
properties
and
in having
large
fluctuations
with
distinct
characteristics.
The
drag
process
thus
provides
an
excellent
test-bed
for the
strength
of locally
jammed
states
among
the grains
and the effects
of confinement
on the jamming.
We have
studied
the drag
force
as a function
of the velocity,
the depth
in the medium,
the
grain
size and morphology
for a vertical
cylinder.
The
data agree
well
with
theory
for spherical
media,
but
show
an
anomalously
strong
depth
dependence
for
non-spherical
grains.
We also
study
the
drag
force
on discrete
objects
with
circular
cross
section
moving
slowly
through
a
spherical
granular
medium.
Variations
in the
geometry
of the dragged
object
change
the
drag
force
only
by a small
fraction
relative
to shape
effects
in fluid
drag.
The
drag
force
depends
quadratically
on the object's
diameter
as expected.
We do observe,
however,
a deviation
above
the expected
linear
depth
dependence,
and the magnitude
of the deviation
is apparently
controlled
by geometrical
factors.
We also
have
studied
fluctuations
in the drag
force
experienced
by a vertical
moving
through
a granular
medium.
The
successive
formation
and
collapse
of jammed
states
give
a stick-slip
nature
to the
fluctuations
which
are
periodic
at
small
depths
but
become
"stepped"
at
large
depths,
a transition
which
we
interpret
as a consequence
of the long-range
nature
of the
force
chains
and
the
finite
size
of our experiment.
Another
important
finding
is that
the mean
force
and the fluctuations
appear
to be independent
of the properties
of the contact
surface
between
the
grains
and
the
dragged
object.
These
results
imply
that
the
drag
force
originates
in the bulk
properties
of the granular
sample.
Very recent
work
has focused
on the effects
of solid
barriers
within
the grains
on penetration
of a granular
medium.
We have
studied
the
force
required
to insert
an object
vertically
into
a
granular
medium,
with
particular
attention
to the effect
of the bottom
boundary.
We find
that,
despite
the long range
nature
of the force
chains,
the existence
of the solid
bottom
of the granular
container
only
affects
the
force
when
the
inserted
object
is within
a short
range
of the bottom,
and that the roughness
of the bottom
surface
has a strong
effect
on the force's
depth
profile.

ABSTRACT
The behavior
of granular
materials
spans
the whole
range
from
an elastic
solid
to a non-linear
viscous
fluid.
The constitutive
relation
depends
not only on the material
composition,
but
also on
the
deformation
and
the rate
of deformation.
The
key
reason
for
this behavior
is that
granular
materials
are not
only defined
by the properties
of the individual
grains,
but also by the structure
of the aggregate.
In a very dilute
granular
flow, the structure
of the aggregate
is simply
defined
by
a uniform
random
distribution.
As the
concentration
increases,
the
internal
structure
becomes
complex.
It evolves
dynamically
with
the macroscopic
deformation
and is an integral
part
of the
constitutive
relation.
The
complexity
and
importance
of the internal
structure
increase
with
the
concentration.
In
a gravity
field,
the
weight
of
a granular
material
naturally
compacts
it to
produce
a concentration
gradient.
To study
the constitutive
behavior
of granular
materials,
the
presence
of gravity
is therefore
detrimental.
Although
empirical
relations
have been
obtained
for
engineering
designs
to control
granular
flows
on Earth,
it is not
known
how
well
these
Earth-
bound
relations
can be used
in another
gravity
field.
Fundamental
understanding
must
be derived
to reliably
design
for granular
flows
in space
exploration.
There
are two
extremes
of granular
flows
of which
significant
amount
of knowledge
is
available.
One
deals
with
a dense
and
quasi-static
situation
where
the deformation
rate
nearly
vanishes.
The
other
deals
with
dilute
and
rapidly
fluctuating
grain
velocities
where
particle
inertia
dominates.
In near
stationary
granular
flows
the internal
normal
stress
overwhelms
the
gravity
effect.
The
concentration
gradient
due to gravity
is negligible.
In inertia
dominant
flows
the only
type
of internal
structure
is the uniform
random
distribution
of grains.
As long
as the
concentration
is low,
its
gradient
does
not
affect
this
internal
structure.
However,
under
most
natural
conditions,
a flowing
granular
material
falls
in between
these
two
extremes.
It is in this
transitional
regime
that
internal
structure
is sensitive
to the concentration
variation.
This project,
funded
by the NASA
Microgravity
Fluid
Physics
Program,
aims
to study
this transitional
regime
via physical
experiments
and computer
simulations.
A conceptual
model
has been
established
as
described
below.
There
are two
natural
time
scales
in a granular
flow.
One
is the travel
time
between
two
consecutive
collisions
and
the other
is the duration
of a collision
contact.
At a very
low
shear-
rate,
the shear-induced
particle
velocity
is low. Hence
the travel
time between
collisions
is longer
than
the
contact
time
between
colliding
particles.
Binary
collisions
prevail.
As the
shear-rate
increases,
the traveling
time between
collisions
reduces
and the probability
of multiple
collisions
NASA/T_2002-211211
141

goes
up.
These
particle
groups
disperse
shortly
after
and new
groups
form.
When
shear-rate
is
further
increased,
clusters
grow
in size
due
to an increasing
chance
for
free
particles
to join
before
groups
have
the time
to disperse.
The maximum
cluster
size
may
depend
on the global
concentration
and material
properties.
As the solid
concentration
approaches
zero,
the cluster
size
goes
to one
particle
diameter.
The
maximum
possible
cluster
size
under
any
condition
is the
container
size,
provided
that
the
shear
flow
is inside
a container.
The
critical
shear-rates
that
dictate
the initiation
of the multiple
contacts,
and the size
and lifetime
of the collision
clusters,
are functions
of the concentration
also.
A t'egime"theory
has been
proposed
in Babic
et al. (
J.
Fluid
Mech.
219:81-118,1990).
This
theory
suggested
that
both
the solid
concentration,
C, and
the
non-dimensional
shear-rate,
B, are
important
in
determining
the
regimes
of
the
granular
constitutive
law, as shown
in the figure.
¢2_rm_fiOn
In the coming
years,
both
physical
and
computer
experiments
will
be conducted.
These
experiments
will
determine
the
stress
and
strain-rate
relation
while
the
microstructure
of the
granular
material
dynamically
changes.
Data
obtained
from
these
experiments
will
be
used
to
link the microstructure
of the granular
material
to the resulting
constitutive
relations.
The above
regime
theory
will be quantified.
This poster
gives
a brief
overview
of the physical
experiment,
the computer
simulation,
and how these
two will be integrated.

ABSTRACT
The quiescent
and
flow-induced
structure
and
dynamics
of
colloidal
aggregates
and
gels
of
anisometric
particles
are studied
by
means
of static
and dynamic
light
scattering.
Ground-based
studies
of weak
gels
are possible
due
to the
submicron
size
of the
boehmite
rod
suspensions
investigated;
however,
microgravity
conditions
would
be required
for
more
general
studies.
The
properties
of colloidal
rod
suspensions
are compared
to typical
properties
of spherical
particle
gels to understand
the role of anisotropic
excluded
volume
on gel structure
and dynamics.
The structure
and dynamics
of colloidal
aggregates
and gels have
long been
of scientific
and
technological
interest;
however,
most
research
has
focused
on suspensions
of spherical
particles.
Yet,
aggregates
and
gels
of
anisometric
particles
- colloidal
rods
and
platelets
- may
exhibit
structure
and dynamics
that
are quite different
from
spherical
colloids.
For
example,
suspensions
of colloidal
rods
gel at extremely
low
volume
fractions
and
form
birefringent
sediments
(A.R
Philipse,
A.-M.
Nechifor
and C. Pathmamanoharan,
Langmuir
10, 4451
(1994)).
The
rheology
of
solutions
and
gels
of
colloidal
rods
and
platelets
differs
dramatically
from
that
of
colloidal
spheres
(M.J.
Solomon
and D.V
Boger,
J. Rheology
42, 929
(1998)).
Scientifically,
studies
with
anisometric
particles
offer
the opportunity
to assess
the role
of anisotropic
excluded
volume
and
particle
orientation
in aggregates
and gels.
Technologically,
anisometric
colloids
find use in a wide
range
of
materials
such
as
ceramics,
polymer
nanocomposites,
well-bore
drilling
fluids
and
magnetic
storage
media.
Model
colloidal
boehmite
rods
of approximately
monodisperse
dimension
and
aspect
ratio
have been
synthesized
according
to the method
of Philipse
and coworkers.
In aqueous
solution,
these
materials
undergo
gelation
upon the addition
of divalent
salt.
By
means
of a novel
grafting
reaction
and procedure
for solvent
refractive
index
matching,
the rods
have
also
been
dispersed
in
mixed
organic
solvents.
In this case, gelation
is induced
by means
of depletion
interaction.
We report
the
effect
of particle
shape
and
anisotropic
excluded
volume
on
the
structure,
rheology,
and
intemal
dynamics
of
colloidal
gels.
The
quiescent
structure
of
these
gels
is
characterized
over two
decades
in the scattering
vector,
q, by combined
small
and wide-angle
light
scattering.
The
effect
of particle
aspect
ratio
on the gel microstructure
is studied
in particular.
Light
scattering
studies
conducted
as shear
deformation
is applied
to the
material
quantify
how
colloidal
aggregates
are oriented
and
deformed
by
flow.
The
intemal
dynamics
of the
gels
are
quantified
by means
of photon
correlation
spectroscopy.

ABSTRACT
Current
data
on
droplet
breakup
is
scarce
for
the
sizes
and
velocities
typical
of practical
applications
such
as
in
spray
combustion
processes
and
coating
processes.
While
much
more
representative
of practical
applications,
the small
spatial
scales
and rapid
time-scales
prevent
detailed
measurement
of the internal
fluid dynamics
and liquid property
gradients
produced
by impinging
upon
surfaces.
Realized
through
the
extended
spatial
and
temporal
scales
afforded
by
a microgravity
environment,
an
improved
understanding
of
drop
breakup
dynamics
is sought
to understand
and
ultimately
control the impingement
dynamics
of droplets upon surfaces in practical
situations.

images
of a sequences
showing
the
spreading
of a single
droplet

(We=386,
Re=370).
The primary
objective
of this research
will be to mark the onset of different
"splashing
modes"
and
to determine
their temperature,
pressure
and angle dependence
for impinging
droplets
representative
of
practical
fluids.
In addition,
we are modeling
the evolution
of droplets
that do not initially
splash
but
rather
undergo
a "fingering"
evolution
observed
on the spreading
fluid front and the transformation
of
these
fingers
into splashed
products.
An example
of our experimental
data is presented
below.
These
images
are of Isopar
V impacting
a mirror-polished
surface.
They
were
acquired
using
a high-speed
NASA/T_2002-211211
145

camera
at 1000
frames
per
second.
They
show
the spreading
of a single
droplet
after
impact
and
ensuing finger instabilities.

Normal gravity experimental
data such as this will guide low gravity measuxements
in the 2.2 second
drop
tower
and
KC-135
aircraft
as available.
Presently
we
are in the process
of comparing
the
experimental
data of droplet
shape
evolution
to numerical
models,
which
can also capture
the internal
fluid dynamics
and liquid property
gradients
such as produced
by impingement
upon a heated
surface.
To-date
isothermal
numerical
data
has
been
modeled
using
direct
numerical
simulations
of
representative
splashing
droplets.
The process
involves
using
fluid
front-tracking
methods.
These
numerical
methods
are based
on writing
and simultaneously
solving
a set of basic
equations
for the
whole
computational
domain
using
two grids systems
to track a single
droplet
as it interacts
with and
spreads
along
a solid
wall.
The momentum
transport
equations
are solved
by
a conventional
finite
volume
method
on a fixed,
structuxed
grid
and the interface
is tracked
explicitly.
The
fluid-tracking
algorithm
determines
the advections
and distribution
of the fluid properties
such as viscosity
and density.
The surface
tension is implemented
as a source
term in the momentum
equation.
At the splashing
wall,
fluid wall
interactions
are described
by slip boundary
conditions.
We
are in the process
of adding
contract
line hydrodynamics.
The data obtained
so far indicates
that the present
model
describes
well the droplet wall interactions
to a point
in time just
before
splash.
We
will
present
a comparison
of our experimental
data to
representative
numerical
cases.
We are also updating
the code to take into account
multiple
tracking
of
the droplets
after splash. As time permits
we will present
this data also.

The flow
around
a fixed
cylinder
immersed
in a uniform
granular
flow
is studied
experimentally.
Experiments
are performed
in a tall vertical
chute
that produces
a quasi
two-dimensional
granular
flow.
A storage
bin at the top of the chute
feeds
glass
particles
into the channel
while
the mean
velocity
of the flow
is controlled
by varying
the width
of
a hopper
located
at the channel
exit.
Measurements
of the drag force
acting
on a fixed
cylinder
are made
using
a strain
gauge
force
measurement
system.
The flow
velocity
field
is measured
through
a transparent
wall
using
particle
image
velocimetry
analyses
of
high
speed
video
recordings
of the flow.
Experiments
are performed
for a range
of
upstream
particle
velocities,
cylinder
diameters,
and two diameters
of glass
particles.
For the range
of velocities
studied,
the drag force
acting
on the cylinder
is independent
of
the mean
flow
velocity,
contrary
to what
is expected
from
any ordinary
fluid.
The drag
force
scales
with the asymptotic
static
stress
state
in a tall granular
bed.
The drag
coefficient,
defined
in terms
of a dynamic
pressure,
scales
with the flow

and a length
scale parameter
that accounts
for the effective
cylinder
size.
Although
the drag force
on the cylinder
does
not change
with the upstream
flow
velocity,
the flow
streamlines
do, in fact,
change
with velocity.
A large
stagnation
zone
forms
at
the leading
edge of the cylinder
while
at the trailing
edge
an empty
wake
is observed.
The wake
size increases
with flow
velocity.

A two-dimensional
collisional
granular
flow
past
an immersed
cylinder
is investigated
using
discrete
element
computer
simulations.
The drag force
acting
on the cylinder,
Fd, is
proportional
to the upstream
bulk density,
pvo_, where
p is the upstream
particle
mass
density
and vo_is the upstream
solid
fraction,
the square
of the upstream
velocity,
U_, and
the sum of the cylinder
diameter,
D, and surrounding
particle
diameter,
d.
The drag
coefficient,
defined
as Ca = (2Fd)/(pvo_U_2(D+d))
has a strong
dependence
on the flow
Knudsen
number
and a secondary
weak
dependence
on the Mach
number.
The drag
coefficient
decreases
slightly
with
decreasing
coefficient
of restitution
and is relatively
insensitive
to the inter-particle
friction
coefficient.
Bow
shock
structures
and expansion
fans similar
to those
observed
in compressible
fluid flows
are also observed.

ABSTRACT
In the typical
operation
of a packed-bed
reactor,
gas and liquid
flow
simultaneously
through
a fixed
bed
of solid
particles.
Depending
on
the
application,
the
particles
can
be
of various
shapes
and sizes
and provide
for intimate
contact
and high
rates
of transport
between
the phases
needed
to
sustain
chemical
or
biological
reactions.
The
packing
may
also
serve
as
either
a
catalyst
or as a support
for growing
biological
material.
NASA
has flown
two
of these
packed-
bed systems
in a microgravity
environment
with limited
or no success
(Motil
et al. [1]).
The goal
of this
research
is to develop
models
(with
scale-up
capability)
needed
for
the
design
of the
physicochemical
equipment
to carry
out these
unit
operations
in microgravity.
New
insight
will
also lead to improvements
in normal
gravity
operations.
Our
initial
experiment
was
flown
using
an
existing
KC-135
two-phase
flow
rig
with
a
modified
test
section.
The test
section
is a clear
polycarbonate
rectangular
column
with
a depth
of
2.54
cm,
a width
of
5.08
cm,
and
60
cm
long.
The
column
was
randomly
packed
with
spherical
glass
beads
by slowly
dropping
the beads
into the bed.
Even
though
care
was taken
in
handling
the column
after
it was
filled
with
packing,
the alternating
high
and low
gravity
cycles
with
each
parabola
created
a slightly
tighter
packed
bed than
is typically
reported
for this type.
By the
usual
method
of comparing
the weight
difference
of a completely
dry
column
versus
a
column
filled
with
water,
the
void
fraction
was
found
to be
.345
for both
sizes
of beads
used.
Five
flush
mounted
differential
pressure
transducers
are spaced
at even
intervals
with
the
first
location
4
cm
from
the
inlet
port
and
the
subsequent
pressure
transducers
spaced
at
13 cm
intervals
along
the
column.
Differential
pressure
data
was
acquired
at 1000
Hz
to adequately
observe
pulse
formation
and
characteristics.
Visual
images
of the
flow
were
recorded
using
a
high-speed
SVHS
system
at 500
frames
per
second.
Over
250
different
test
conditions
were
evaluated
along
with
a companion
set of tests
in normal
gravity.
The
flow
rates,
fluid
properties
and packing
properties
were
selected
to provide
a range
of several
orders-of-magnitude
for the
important
dimensionless
parameters.
The
well
known
Ergun
equation
for
single
phase
flow
through
porous
media
is written
by
superposing
the pressure
drop
expression
for purely
viscous
(Blake-Kozeny)
and purely
inertial
losses
(Burke-Plummer):

s -- void fraction,
U -- fluid
superficial
velocity,
Dp -- packing
diameter,
and Z -- column

For
two-phase
flow
in the
microgravity
environment,
the
measured
pressure
drop
is the
true
frictional
pressure
drop
since
the
hydrostatic
head
is
nearly
zero.
Through
dimensional
arguments
(neglecting
gravity
and the bed inclination),
the non-dimensional
form
of the pressure
drop
is:

The
pressure
drop
may
be
assumed
to be
a weak
function
of the
last
two
ratios
(density
and
viscosity)
as they
are small
and do not vary
significantly.
Rearranging
into
a dimensionless
form
and adding
an expression
for the gas Reynolds
number
and liquid
Weber
number,
the form
of the
modified

becomes:

A
homogeneous
disordered
phase
separates
into
ordered
structures
when
quenched
into a broken-symmetry
phase.
The competition
of broken-symmetry
phases
to
select
an equilibrium
state
may
be
studied
in terms
of coarse-grained
order
parameters
described
by
a suitable
Landau
free-energy
function.
A network
of equilibrium-phase
domains
develops
on quenching
and
coarsens
with
time
with
a topology
that
may
be
controlled
by
shear.
We
use
three-dimensional
simulations,
in which
time-dependent
models
for
conserved-order
parameters
coupled
to
Navier-Stokes
fluid
models
are
solved,
to investigate
the
evolution
of
such
domains,
e.g.
spinodal
decompositions
of
polymeric
materials
under
shear.
The numerical
problems
are formidable
because
of the
strong
nonlinearities
inherent
in the coupled
model,
and these
are amongst
the first
3D
calculations
undertaken.
In linear
shear
fields
we find stable
nanostrings,
also recently
seen in experiments.
The
affinity
of the ordered
phases
to boundaries
plays
a role in the form
of the structures
that
develop,
with
stacked
plate-like
phase
distributions
emerging
under
certain
conditions.
Such methods
appear
quite
promising
for design
and analysis
of multiphase
and
complex
fluid
formulations.
The
behavior
of
foams
in
such
conditions
is
of
particular
interest
in microgravity
environments.

A mesoscopic
approach
is taken
tbr modeling
flow in multiphase
systems,
with
the
system
characterized
by a coarse-grained
conserved
order
parameter
that
takes
characteristic
values
in the bulk
phases
and
varies
continuously
in a narrow
interracial
region).
This
approach
(Chella,
R.
and
Vinals,
J,
"Mixing
of a two-
phase
fluid
by cavity
flow",
Phys.
Rev.
E 53,3832
(1996))
provides
significant
computational
advantages
over classical
continuum
approaches.
This
fbrmulation
has been
extended
to incorporate
interactions
with
solid
boundaries
through
modification
of free
energy
functionals
to
include
short-range
and
long
range
interactions
with
the
walls.
This
approach
has
been
implemented
using
a lattice-Boltzmann
approach.
Development
of
Parallel
MPI
program
To facilitate
application
of the the
lattice-Boltzmann
method
fbr immiscible
transport
to three-dimensional
and
irregular
geometries,
a parallel
version
of the
program
was
developed
using
MPI
(Message
Passing
Interface)
. Both
three-dimensional
and
one-dimensional
domain
decompositions
were
tested.
Superlinear
speedup
was
observed.
This
is expected
to
be
due
to
the
large
memory
requirements
for
the
lattice
Boltzmann
method
in three-dimensions
which
results
in extensive
memory
paging
fbr all but
the
smallest
systems.
Evolution
of
microstructure
and
rheology
in
complex
fluids
under
externally
applied
flows
The
influence
of shear
and
extensional
flows
in retarding
phase
separation
and
stabilizing
certain
mor-
phologies
was investigated.
In particular,
the interplay
between
interracial
tension
and
viscosity
diflSrences
between
phases
are
examined.
Specific
applications
are
to
binary
fluids
undergoing
spinodal
decomposi-
tion,
and
the
nucleation
and
growth
of droplets.
In binary
liquid
mixtures,
the
morphology
of the
phase
separating
domain
varies
from
interconnected
domains
(bicontinuous
patterns)
to droplets,
depending
on
composition
and
quench
depth.
Hydrodynamics
significantly
influences
the
dynamics
of phase
separation.
For
sufficiently
strong
flows,
a non-equilibrium
morphology
can
be
stabilized.
Results
of
a simulation
of two-dimensional
spinodal
decomposition
under
shear
is shown.
The

cases

case

For
spinodal
decomposition
under
shear,
the
system
is no longer
isotropic,
and
a useful
measure
of the
morphology
of the
system
is given
by:

As the
order
parameter

rapidly
in the
interfacial
region,
V_
is in the
direction

to
the
interface.
Under
shear,
the
off-diagonal
components
of
A
tend
to
zero
at
long
times
because
of the
alignment
of the

In two

it is relatively

to directly

and
the
proportionality
of

In
three-dimensional

it is difficult
to directly

but
IV_I 2 is readily
calculated.
The

carried
out

for spinodal

Both

are used.
At long times
both
lamellar

structures
are observed
depending
on the
capillary

The evolution

ABSTRACT
Experiments
on characterization
of thin
liquid
films
over
stationary
and
rotating
disks
are
described
in this
study.
The
thin
liquid
film
is created
by
controlled
liquid
impingement
by
introducing
deionized
water
from
a flow
collar
at the center
of an aluminum
disk
at a known
initial
film
thickness
with
uniform
radial
velocity.
Experiments
were
performed
for
a range
of
Reynolds
numbers
based
on the liquid
inlet gap height
and velocity
and (flow
rates)
between
238
(3.0 lpm)
and
1188 (15.0
lpm).
The angular
speed
of the disk was varied
from
0 rpm to 300 rpm.
Radial
film
thickness
distribution
was
measured
using
a non-intrusive
laser
light
reflection
technique
that enabled
the measurement
of the instantaneous
film thickness
over
a finite
segment
of the disk.
When
the disk was stationary,
a circular
hydraulic
jump
was present.
The liquid
film
thickness
in
the
subcritical
region
(downstream
of
the
hydraulic
jump)
was
an
order
of
magnitude
greater
than
that
in the supercritical
region
(upstream
of the hydraulic
jump)
which
was
of the
order
of 0.3 mm.
As
the Reynolds
number
increased,
the hydraulic
jump
migrated
toward
the edge
of the disk.
In case
of rotation,
the liquid
film
thickness
exhibited
a maximum
on the disk surface.
The liquid
film inertia
and friction
influenced
the inner
region
where
the film
thickness
progressively
increased.
The
outer
region
where
the
film
thickness
decreased
was
primarily
affected
by the centrifugal
forces.
A flow
visualization
study
of the thin
film
was also
performed
to determine
the
characteristics
of the waves
on the free
surface.
At high
rotational
speeds,
radial
waves
were
observed
on the liquid
film.
It was
also
found
that
the tangent
of the
waves
present
on the liquid
surface
was
a function
of the ratio
of local
radial
velocity
and local
azimuthal
velocity.
Radial
temperature
distribution
was
measured
using
an
amplified
thermocouple/slip
ring
arrangement.
Local
Nusselt
number
was
seen
to increase
with
flow
rate
and angular
velocity.
The inertia
forces
rather
than
rotation
was found
to have
more
significance
on the Nusselt
number
at the inner
parts
of the disk.
Semi-empirical
correlations
were
presented
in this
study
for
the
local
and
average
Nusselt
numbers.
For
nucleate
boiling
experiments,
temperature
profile
over
the disk was measured
using
the same
amplified
thermocouple/slip
ring
arrangement.
Laser
light
reflection
technique
was utilized
to measure
the bubble
size,
its growth
and
motion.
The
bubbles
were
found
to
grow
to
diameters
that
were
larger
than
the
film
thickness.
The dynamics
of bubble
motion
was characterized
as a function
of rotational
speed
of
the disk,
liquid
flowrate
over the disk as well
as the overheat
level.

ABSTRACT
Electromagnetic

investigated
to
study
the
transport
phenomena
associated
with
melting
of
an
electrically

Phase

Electromagnetic
fields
are configured
in
such
a way
that
the resulting
Lorentz
force
can
be used
to damp
and/or
counteract
the natural
convection
as
well
as
the
flow
induced
by
sedimentation
and/or
floatation,
and
thereby
simulating
the
low

environment
of
outer

Computational
experiments
are
conducted
for unfixed

equations
are
discretized
using
a control-volume-based
finite
difference
scheme.
Numerical
solutions
are
obtained
for true
low-gravity
environment
as well
as for the
simulated-low-gravity.
The
result
shows
that
when
the
Lorentz
force
is caused
by the presence
of magnetic
field
alone,
the low-
gravity
condition
is simulated
by the damping
effect,
which
is shown
to have
a profound
effect
on the flow
field
(see
Fig. 2(c)).
On the other
hand,
it is shown
that under
electromagnetic
field
simulation,
where
the Lorentz
force
is caused
by the transverse
electric
and magnetic
fields,
it is
possible
to minimize
the
flow
field
distortion
caused
by the high
magnetic
field
and therefore
achieving
a much
better
simulation
of low-gravity.
See Figs.
2(b) and 3.
Fig.
3
illustrate
the
effects
of
actual
and
simulated
low-gravity
on
the
major
melting
characteristics
such
as the
Solid
velocity,
Melt
thickness
and
Melt
rate.
As
seen
here,
low-
gravity
simulated
by the
electromagnetic
field
(or
electric
low-gravity),
show
good
agreement
with
those
of
actual
low
gravity
whereas
the
magnetically
simulated
cases,
show
some
discrepancies.
Among
these
discrepancies
are
the
fact
that
the
melt
rate
under
some
ranges
magnetic
low-gravity
(i.e.,
gB > g010 3) are higher
than
those
of electric
low-gravity,
See
Fig.
3
(c).
This suggests
that
these
higher
melt
rate cannot
be attributed
to the effects
of Joule
heating,
which
would
otherwise
favor
the electric
field
simulation,
therefore
the damping
effect
must
be
the cause.
Also,
the "no transient
regions"
on the solid
velocities,
suggests
that the solid
velocity
under
magnetic
low-gravity
respond
directly
to the magnetic
forces,
which
respond
much
faster
than
the momentum
diffusion
associated
with the melting
evolution.

ABSTRACT
The dynamics
of gas-particle
and granular
flows
impact
numerous
technologies
related
to
the
local
utilization
of Lunar
and Martian
soils
and the
Martian
atmosphere.
On
earth,
such
flows
occur
in a large number
of industries
including
the chemical,
pharmaceutical,
materials,
mining
and food
industries.
DENSITY
WAVES
IN GRAVITY-DRIVEN
GRANULAR
FLOW
A
particle
dynamic
computer
simulation
is used
to examine
rapid
granular
flow
in a
vertical
channel.
Flow
in
the
channel
leads
to an
inhomogeneous
distribution
of
the
particles
and two
distinct
types
of density
waves
are identified:
an S-shaped
wave
and a
clump.
The
density
waves
are
further
characterized
by
quantifying
their
temporal
evolution
using
Fourier
methods
and
examining
local
and
global
flow
properties
of the
system,
including
velocities,
mass
fluxes,
granular
temperatures
and
stresses.
A
parametric
study
is used
to characterize
the effect
of the system
parameters
on the density
waves.
In particular
we
are able
to show
that
the
dynamics
of large
systems
are
often
qualitatively
and quantitatively
different
from
those
of small
systems.
Finally,
the types
of
density
waves
and
dominant
Fourier
modes
observed
in our
work
are
compared
to
those
that
are predicted
using
a linear
stability
analysis
of equations
of motion
for rapid
granular
flow.
CONNECTIONS
BETWEEN
DENSITY
WAVES
IN
GAS-PARTICLE
FLOWS
AND
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOWS
It is shown
that
under
certain
simplifying
assumptions,
model
equations
of motion
and
continuity
for the particles
in a fluidized
bed
can be
related
to those
of a compressible
fluid
acted
upon
by a density
dependent
force.
A linear
stability
analysis
shows
that
the
NASA/T_2002-211211
163

base
state
of the
compressible
flow
equations
can
lose
stability
in the
form
of plane
density
waves.
The
plane
waves
emerge
through
a Hopf
bifurcation
and
propagate
through
the
bed
as
traveling
waves.
Through
a
bifurcation
analysis
coupled
with
parameter
continuation
we
compute
the
solution
structure
of the fully-developed
plane
waves.
It is found
that
as the amplitudes
of the plane
waves
increase,
they
lose
stability
in
the lateral
direction.
A comparison
of these
results
with
previous
work
on gas-fluidized
beds
shows
that
the
salient
features
of the instability
of a gas-fluidized
bed are captured
by the basic
physics
of compressible
flows.

Objectives
The
objective
of the
study
is to investigate
the behavior
of individual
air bubbles
injected
through
an
orifice
into an electrically
insulating
liquid
under
the influence
of a static
electric
field
(Figure
1a). Both
uniform
and
nonuniform
electric
field
configurations
were
considered.
Bubble
formation
and
detachment
were
recorded
and visualized
in reduced
gravity
(corresponding
to gravity
levels
on Mars,
on the Moon
as well
as microgravity)
using
a high-speed
video
camera.
Bubble
volume,
dimensions
and
contact
angle
at
detachment
were
measured.
In
addition
to the
experimental
studies,
a simple
model,
predicting
bubble
characteristics
at
detachment
was
developed.
The
model,
based
on
thermodynamic
considerations,
accounts
for the level
of gravity
as well
as the magnitude
of the uniform
electric
field.
Measured
data
and model
predictions
show
good
agreement
and indicate
that the level
of
gravity
and the electric
field
magnitude
significantly
affect
bubble
shape,
volume
and dimensions.
Experimental
setup
The experimental
setup
designed
for this study
is arranged
in three
racks.
The experimental
rack
carries
the
test
cell
and
the
measurement
and
actuation
equipment.
The
personal
computer
rack
carries
the
[
computer,
monitor,
data
acquisition
and
control
hardware
and
power
backup
units.
The
camera
rack
with
the high-speed
video
recorder
is connected
to the camera
head
on the experimental
rack
through
the umbilical.
A triaxial
accelerometer
measures
the components
of the acceleration
vector.
The NEC
500 high-speed
video
recorder
(provided
by NASA
GRC)
allows
visualization
of the bubble
formation
process.
The
test
cell
is a rectangular
vessel
(Figure
lb).
Its four
walls
are manufactured
of
12.Smm
thick,
clear
Polycarbonate
to
allow
visualization
experiments.
The
volume
of
the
test
cell
is
9cmx9cmxl0cm.
A static
electric
field
E (0-15. SkV/cm)
is formed
between
the bottom
electrode
and a
parallel
top
electrode,
spaced
20mm
apart.
The
bottom
electrode
is a 15mm
diameter,
electrically
grounded
copper
cylinder.
Air
is injected
into
the
test
cell
(at
constant
flow
rate
through
a 1.5mm
diameter
orifice
in the
bottom
electrode)
with
a syringe,
driven
by
a linear
translation
stage.
The
working
fluid,
PF5052,
is chemically
inert
and electrically
insulating.
Its relative
permittivity
is 1.73. In
order
to better
understand
the structure
of the electric
field
in the test
cell, the electric
field
distribution
was
computed
assuming
a 2D configuration,
using
the commercial
finite
element
code,
FEMLAB
2.0
(Figure

Results
The
reduced
gravity
environment
was realized
during
parabolic
flights
in NASA's
KC-135
aircraft.
A
period
of about
20s of low
gravity
was available
per parabola.
Experiments
were
carried
out in bolted-
down
and
free-floating
configurations.
Bubbles
shown
in this
section
represent
typical
behavior
of
injected
bubbles
at detachment
for a particular
set of experimental
conditions.
When
the detachment
of
the bubble
occurred
after
a regular
and periodic
formation
behavior,
key bubble
dimensions
(volume
Vdm, major

Shapes

recorded

their

for
electric

magnitudes
of
E=0,
2.5,
5, 7.5
and
10kV/cm
are
presented
in Figure
2.
Without
the
electric
field,
the bubble
in Fig.
2a
is almost
spherical
(aspect
ratio
of
1.1)
and slightly
tilted
due to small,
residual,
lateral
acceleration
components.
Based
on Figs.
2c-e
it can be concluded
that
the bubble
is increasingly
elongated
in the direction
parallel
to the
applied
electric
field
and
the
bubble
axis
is vertical.
This
behavior
indicates
that
a uniform
electric
field
affects
bubble
detachment
and defines
the preferential
direction
of the bubble
axis.
As a result
of shape
changes,
the aspect
ratio
and
the
contact
angle
increase
by
27%
and
32%,
respectively,
when
increasing
the
electric
field
magnitude
from
0 to 10kV/cm.
Under
the same
conditions,
the volume
at detachment
is also affected
by
the presence
of the electric
field
and it decreases
by 51%.
The period
of bubble
formation
t_ (the time
between
bubble
apparition
and its detachment)
decreases
50%.
The influence
of gravity
level
on bubble
shape
at detachment
is illustrated
in Figure
3. As expected,
in the investigated
range
of gravity
levels
and electric
field
magnitudes,
the influence
of gravity
level
is more
pronounced
than
that of the electric
field.

The
overall
objective
of
this
research
is to
investigate
the
fundamental
physics
of
film
condensation
in reduced
gravity.
The condensation
of vapor
on a cool
surface
is important
in many
engineering
problems,
1'2 including
spacecraft
thermal
control
and
also
the
behavior
of
condensate
films
that may
form
on the interior
surfaces
of spacecraft.
To examine
the effects
of body
force
on condensing
films,
two
different
geometries
have
been
tested
in the laboratory:
1) a stabilizing
gravitational
body
force
(+lg,
or condensing
surface
facing
"upwards"),
and
2)
de-stabilizing
gravitational
body
force
(-lg,
or
"downwards").
For
each
geometry,
different
fluid
configurations
are
employed
to
help
isolate
the
fluid
mechanical
and
thermal
mechanisms
operative
in condensing
films.
The
fluid
configurations
are a) a condensing
film,
and b) a non-condensing
film
with
film
growth
by mass
addition
by through
the plate
surface.
Condensation
experiments
are conducted
in a test
cell containing
a cooled
copper
or brass
plate
with
an
exposed
diameter
of
12.7
cm.
The
metal
surface
is polished
to
allow
for
double-pass
shadowgraph
imaging,
and
the test
surface
is instrumented
with
imbedded
heat
transfer
gauges
and
thermocouples.
Representative
shadowgraph
images
of a condensing,
unstable
(-1 g) n-pentane
film
are shown
in Fig.
la-b.
The
interfacial
disturbances
associated
with
the
de-stabilizing
body
force
leading
to
droplet
formation
and
break-off
can
be
clearly
seen
in
Fig.
lb.
The
heat
transfer
coefficient
associated
with
the
condensing
film
is shown
in Fig.
2.
The heat
transfer
coefficient
is
seen
to initially
decrease,
consistent
with
the increased
thermal
resistance
due to layer
growth.
For
sufficiently
long time,
a steady
value
of heat transfer
is observed,
accompanied
by continuous
droplet
formation
and break-off.
1,2
The
non-condensing
cell
consists
of
a stack
of
thin
stainless
steel
disks
10 cm in
diameter
mounted
in a brass
enclosure.
The
disks
are perforated
with
a regular
pattern
of 361 holes
each
0.25
mm in diameter.
Non-condensing
experiments
in -lg
have
employed
50 cSt and
125 cSt silicone
oil
pumped
through
the perforated
disks
at a specified
rate by a syringe
micropump.
The time
to droplet
break-off
and the disturbance
wavelengths
appear
to decrease
with increasing
pumping
rate.
The
ability
to reliably
perform
multi-point,
ultrasonic
measurements
of the film
thickness
has
been
demonstrated.
A linear
array
of eight
transducers
of 6 mm diameter
(with
a beam
footprint
of
comparable
size)
are pulsed
with
a square-wave
signal
at a frequency
of 5 MHz
and a pulse
duration
of approximately
0.3
gs.
For
thin
films
(60
gm
to 2-3
mm
in thickness)
the
layer
thickness
is
determined
by frequency
analysis,
where
the received
ultrasound
pulse
is Fourier
transformed
and the
spacing
between
the peaks
in the frequency
spectrum
is analyzed.
3 For thicker
layers
(up to at least
1
cm in thickness),
time-domain
analysis
is performed
of the
received
ultrasound
pulses
to generate
directly
the layer
thickness.
A time-trace
of the
film
thickness
at a point
using
a single
transducer
in the
linear
array
is
shown
in Fig.
3 for the case of an unstable
(-lg)
n-pentane
film.
The oscillations
in film thickness
are
evidently
due to the passage
and/or
shedding
of droplets
from
the
cooled
plate
surface.
The
entire
transducer
array
was
used
to measure
the
changes
in film
thickness
resulting
from
the
passage
of
gravity
waves
generated
either
by an oscillating
wall
or the
impact
of
a single
droplet
on the
free
surface
of a film.
The
enclosure
in both
cases
was
14 cm square
and the transducer
spacing
was
12
mm.
Best
results
were
obtained
using
as test fluid
a mixture
of 50%
glycerol
and
50%
water
with
a
fluid
layer
thickness
of
3-5 mm.

phase
separators,
and
bioreactors.
The
flow
passages
in these
devices
typically
have
a rectangular
cross-section
or some
other
non-circular
cross-section;
may
include
complex
flow
paths
with
branches,
merges
and
bends;
and
may
involve
channel
walls
of different
wettability.
However,
previous
experimental
and
analytical
investigations
of two-phase
flow
in reduced
gravity
have
focussed
on straight,
circular
tubes.
This
study
is an effort
to determine
two-phase
flow behavior,
both
with and without
heat transfer,
in microchannel
configurations
other
than
straight,
circular
tubes.
The goals
are to investigate
the geometrical
effects
on flow
pattern,
pressure
drop
and liquid
holdup,
as well
as to determine
the
relative
importance
of
capillary,
surface
tension,
inertial,
and
gravitational
forces
in
such
geometries.
An
evaporative
heat
exchanger
for
microgravity
thermal
management
systems
has
been
selected
as the target
technology
in this investigation.
Although
such
a heat exchanger
has never
been
developed
at Honeywell,
a preliminary
sizing
has been
performed
based
on knowledge
of
such
devices
in normal
gravity
environments.
Fin shapes
considered
include
plain
rectangular,
offset
rectangular,
and
wavy
fin
configurations.
Each
of
these
fin
passages
represents
a
microchannel
of non-circular
cross
section.
The pans
at the inlet
and outlet
of the heat
exchanger
are flow
branches
and merges,
with
up to 90-deg
bends.
R-134a
has been
used
as the refrigerant
fluid,
although
ammonia
may well
be used
in the eventual
application.
The experimental
portion
of the program
consists
of two phases:
1.
Ground
laboratory
testing
of various
microchannels
in normal
gravity
2.
KC-135
reduced
gravity
testing
of selected
channels
The
first
phase
of the
program
is in progress.
Ground
testing
is being
conducted
in the
Morrin-Martineli-Gier
Memorial
Heat
Transfer
Laboratory
at UCLA.
This
experiment
is an
investigation
of
two-phase
flow
in
small
rectangular
channels,
without
heat
transfer.
For
simplicity,
nitrogen
and water
are used
as the working
fluids.
The experimental
setup
consists
of
a gas-pushed
liquid
feeding
system,
a nitrogen
feeding
system,
the test
section,
a differential
pressure
drop
measurement,
still frame
and video
flow visualization
via CCD
camera,
a nitrogen
flow
meter,
and
a liquid
exit
collection
with
precision
scale
for liquid
flow
rate
measurement.
The
setup
has
been
completed
and preliminary
experiments
have
been
conducted
to verify
the
measurements
and
visualization.
Initial
experiments
have
been
performed
on
a set
of three
channels,
each
with
a rectangular
cross
section
of 0.04
in. width
and 0.02

The

ABSTRACT
The
effect
of gas
evolution
on mass
and heat
transfer
in rotating
electrochemical
cells
is
being
investigated
experimentally,
both
in 1-g and in reduced
gravity.
This work
is motivated
by
the need
of efficient
electrochemical
cells
in microgravity.
In microgravity,
gas bubbles
that are
generated
in an electrochemical
cell must
be removed
from
the electrode
surface.
In the present
work,
we investigate
a means
to enhance
heat and mass
transfer
and,
at the same
time,
to remove
gas bubbles
effectively
for electrochemical
systems.
Currently,
we
are investigating
the
effect
of gas
evolution
on heat
transfer.
A cylindrical
enclosure
is rotated
around
its axis on a rotating
table.
The container
diameter
is 0.15
m and the
depth
is 0.05
m.
The top
wall
is heated
and the bottom
wall
is cooled.
The container
is filled
with
water.
Without
gas
evolution,
the
flow
in the
cell
is driven
mainly
by
the
centrifugal
buoyancy,
which
generates
radially
outward
flow
along
the bottom
wall
and inward
flow
along
the top wall.
In the present
experiment,
the Ekman
number
(Ek) is very small
(1 xl0 -5 < Ek < 4
x104).
Consequently,
the radial
flow
is confined
to relatively
thin
Ekman
layers
along
the top
and bottom
walls.
The
fluid
is mainly
in solid-body
rotation
with
the enclosure,
but
the radial
flow
induces
additional
azimuthal
flow
through
the
Coriolis
force.
As
a result,
the azimuthal
flow
is slower
(faster)
than
the container
rotation
near
the cold
(hot)
wall.
In the present
heat
transfer
experiment,
we
are
in
the
so-called
Ekman
suction
regime,
where
the
centrifugal
buoyancy
is
mainly
balanced
by
the
Coriolis
force,
so
that
the
radial
flow
is
very
much
suppressed.
The
main
quantity
of interest
in the present
experiment
is the overall
heat
transfer
rate
from
the hot to cold
walls,
non-dimensionalized
as the average
Nusselt
number
(Nu).
The
experimentally
measured
Nusselt
is about
2,
which
agrees
well
with
the numerical
simulation
that is being
conducted
to supplement
the experiment.
Since
the radial
flow
is suppressed
by the
Coriolis
force,
in some
tests
we place
partitions
in the container
to retard
the azimuthal
flow
and
to increase
the heat
transfer
rate.
It is shown
that
Nu more
than
doubles
when
the partitions
are
used.
In the heat
transfer
experiment
we generate
bubbles
by water
electrolysis.
Both
oxygen
(at
the anode)
and hydrogen
(at the cathode)
are generated.
The bubbles
move
toward
the container
axis.
A cylindrical
post
is placed
along
the container
axis
with
a special
filter
so that
only
the
bubbles
are removed
through
the center
post.
The
bubble
behaviors
are observed
by
a CCD
camera.
The camera
is either
stationary
or rotates
with
the container.
Along
the cold
(hot)
wall,
the liquid
flow
is opposed
(aided)
by the bubble
flow.
In normal
gravity,
the bubbles
tend
to
move
nearly
upward
near
the bottom
wall
after
they
are generated,
while
they move
along
the top
wall
forming
a so-called
bubble
layer.
Thus,
there
exist
three
boundary
layers,
thermal,
Ekman
NASA/T_2002-211211
171

and
bubble
layers
along
the
top
wall.
The
top
wall
situation
somewhat
resembles
that
in
microgravity.
The
bubbles
could
affect
the
centrifugal
buoyancy
and
Coriolis
forces
significantly.
The present
experiment
covers
from
the thermal
buoyancy
dominant
situation
to
the bubble
buoyancy
dominant
situation.
The amount
of bubble
generation
is controlled
by the
electrical
potential
applied
to the cell.
The flow
fields
and heat
transfer
data taken
under
various
conditions
are presented.
We have
also
conducted
normal
gravity
experiments
on the
gas
evolution
effect
on mass
transfer
in a rotating
electrochemical
cell.
In this experiment,
we are in the so-called
centrifugal
buoyancy
regime
so that the Coriolis
force
has relatively
weak
influence
on the mass
transfer.
It
is found
that
in normal
gravity
the cell current
is basically
controlled
by the kinetic
reaction
at the
electrode.
Thus
the current
is independent
of the rotation
speed
unless
the rotation
speed
is very
high.
A test
apparatus
for parabolic
flight
tests is being
designed.
The basic
concept
is similar
to
the ground-based
work.
Since
the time
for
each
test
is limited
during
parabolic
flights,
we just
focus
on the
bubble
behavior
in a rotating
system
without
heat
transfer,
in particular
we
are
interested
in the bubble
layer
characteristics
in reduced
gravity.
We
have
already
conducted
preliminary
student
experiments
during
parabolic
flights
on the bubble
behavior.
Some
results
from
the tests
are presented.

ABSTRACT
The overall
goal of this
part
of
our
research
is to
determine
experimentally
the
adsorption
equilibrium
data that
will enable
efficient
design
of a separation
process
to remove
carbon
dioxide
from
a CO/CO2
mixture.
An effective
separation
process
will depend
on the
adsorbent
capacity
for both
the strongly
and weakly
adsorbed
components
at the desired
operating
temperature
and
pressure
ranges,
as well
as regeneration
requirements.
Pure
component
and
binary
adsorption
isotherms
are
used
to
determine
the
most
CO
2-
selective
adsorbent.
A quick
uptake
of pure CO2 on a given
adsorbent
at low
pressures
compared
to the
uptake
of pure
CO
on the
same
adsorbent
indicates
that
CO2 molecules
have
a much
stronger
interaction
with
the
adsorbent
surface
than
CO.
This
is
a necessary
property
for
successful
separation
by adsorption.
Adsorption
isotherms
are widely
available
in the literature
for many
pure
components
on various
adsorbents.
Pure
component
isotherms
can be found
in
various
publications
and data handbooks
for CO and
CO2 on activated
carbon
and many
zeolites
[1].
However,
the pressure
range
seldom
extends
beyond
300 kPa,
and the temperature
is usually
limited
as well.
Binary
adsorption
data are much
less abundant
and are more
difficult
to measure
experimentally
[2].
There
are
models
that
can
predict
binary
adsorption
from
the
pure
component
isotherms,
but
such
models
rarely
provide
the
desired
accuracy.
Hence
it
is
necessary
to determine
both
pure
component
and
binary
adsorption
isotherms
to
accurately
design
the separation
system
[3].
A gravimetric
apparatus
was
used
to measure
pure
adsorption
isotherms.
This
is a desirable
method
for adsorbent
screening
due to its ability
to provide
quick
measurements
with
acceptable
accuracy.
A sample
pan is suspended
from
a highly
sensitive
microbalance
and is enclosed
by
a
glass
tube
that
is equipped
with
a water
jacket
for isothermal
experiments.
The
glassware
also
contains
a coil of nichrome
wire
that
is located
around
the sample
pan
and is used
to regenerate
the
adsorbent.
During
regeneration
helium
is used
to purge
impurities
from
the
system
as
it
flows
in from
the bottom
of the glassware
and is vacuumed
out
the top.
After
regeneration,
the
system
is placed
under
vacuum,
and
a data
acquisition
program
is used
to record
the
weight
change
of the adsorbent
with time
as the adsorbate
is introduced
into
the system.
Equilibrium
is
reached
when
the
weight
of the
adsorbent
remains
constant.
The
balance
can
detect
weight
changes
of 10 -6 grams.
CO2 adsorption
isotherms
were
measured
on many
adsorbents
including
NASA/T_2002-211211
173

activated
carbon
and
various
zeolites.
CO
adsorption
isotherms
were
measured
for
the
adsorbents
with the highest
capacity
for CO2.
These
data are shown
in Figure
1.
A volumetric
apparatus
has
been
constructed
inside
an
environmental
chamber
to
allow
measurement
of
high-pressure
pure
component
data
and
binary
adsorption
data
at
various
temperatures.
This
apparatus
consists
of a closed
loop
containing
a circulation
pump
and a fixed
bed packed
with adsorbent.
The loop
is equipped
with
a pressure
transducer
to monitor
system
pressure.
A sample
cylinder
with
a pressure
transducer
is connected
to the
loop
to inject
known
amounts
of gas.
After
injection,
the
pump
is used
to circulate
the gas through
the fixed
bed.
An
injector
and switching
valve
are used to take
100 gL samples
from
the loop
and inject
them
into
a
gas chromatograph.
A thermal
conductivity
detector
is used
to analyze
the
composition
of the
gas after
adsorption
equilibrium
has been
reached.
Initial
moles
injected
into
the
loop
and
final
moles
remaining
in the gas phase
at equilibrium
are used
to calculate
the loadings
from
a material
balance.
This
apparatus
has been
used
to measure
adsorption
isotherms
for pure
CO2 on NaY
at
25,
75
and
125°C.
These
are
shown
in Figure
2.
Mixture
data
have
also
been
measured
to
determine
the best
adsorbent
for our application.

ABSTRACT
Three
flow
regimes
have
been
identified
for gas-liquid
flow
in a microgravity
environment:
Bubble,
Slug,
and
Annular.
For
the
slug
and
annular
flow
regimes,
the behavior
observed
in
vertical
upflow
in
normal
gravity
is similar
to
microgravity
flow
with
a thin,
symmetrical
annular
film wetting
the tube wall.
However,
the motion
and behavior
of this film is significantly
different
between
the normal
and low
gravity
cases.
Specifically,
the liquid
film
will
slow
and
come
to a stop during
low
frequency
wave
motion
or slugging.
In normal
gravity
vertical
upflow,
the
film has
been
observed
to slow,
stop,
and
actually
reverse
direction
until
it meets
the next
slug or wave.
Using
the unit
slug approach,
as seen
in Figure
1, a quick
estimate
for the film thickness
can
be derived
by the following
relationship:
0¢=1-
--
Combined
with
the following
from
the
drift
flux model:
PL
X
PG 1-x
a=
PG 1-x
1--
Figure 1: Unit Slug Concept
Rearranging
yields
the
film
thickness,
however,
this
estimate
assumes
that
the
vapor
and
liquid
phases
are
either
distributed
in an
annular
flow
with
very
thin
liquid
slugs
separating
annular
pockets
or with significant
gas entrainment
in the liquid
slugs.
A minimum
film
thickness
can be attained
by assuming
that
most
of the gas is contained
in
the Taylor
bubble.
Therefore,
if one slug
unit consists
of both
a liquid
slug
and a Taylor
bubble
and assuming
that
the void
fraction
is zero
in the slug,
a mass
balance
performed
on the Taylor
bubble
portion
of the slug unit will obtain
the following:
NASA/T_2002-211211
175

a_V
+ (1 - a_)UL_
= JL + JG
By rearrangment,
the void
fraction
in the Taylor
bubbles
is given by:
V - (j_
+ JL )
a B = 1 -
V - ULB
where
V is the velocity
of the Taylor
bubble
and ULB is the velocity
of the liquid
film.
Within
the
Taylor
bubble,
the
film
thickness
decreases
from
the nose
to the tail.
Far from
the nose,
it
reaches
its fully developed
thickness.
This
thickness
may
be found
directly
by noting
that there
is
no driving
force
acting
on the
film
except
for the interracial
shear
stress.
By
disregarding
this
effect,
the film
does
not
experience
a driving
force
and its velocity
must
be zero
with
respect
to
the standing
frame
(ULB=0).
This
has been
experimentally
confirmed
by watching
small
bubbles
that
are entrained
in the thin
liquid
film
around
the Taylor
bubble
and gives
the minimum
film
thickness
in these
bubbles:
D V-(j
G +JL)
hmin = 4
V
If
V -_ C0(ULs
+U_s),
then
C0-1D

For
values
of
C0=l.2,
the
minimum
film
thickness
is
approximately
0.8
mm,
which
is
significantly
smaller
than the values
found
using
the drift
flux model.
Data
obtained
for
air-water,
air-water
and glycerine
mixture
(50 w/o
and viscosity
@ ), and
an air-water
and surfactant
mixture
(Zonyl
FSP TM,
1 w/o and surface
tension
of 20 dynes/cm)
was
obtained
at in a 1.27
cm ID tube
at low
gravity 1.
16 mm
movie
film
data
was
obtained
at 400
frames
per
second.
Bubbles
located
within
the
thin
liquid
annular
film
were
tracked
for their
position
as a function
of time
and analyzed
as a measure
of the liquid
axial
velocity
relative
to
the passage
of slugs
or annular
roll
waves.
It was
found
that
there
was
always
a slowing
of the
thin liquid
film
or substrate
until
the next
slug or roll wave
accelerated
the film again.
Liquid
film thickness
data was obtained
at 1000 Hz from
thin wire conductivity
probes.
Their
accuracy
was
about
0.02
mm.
A
histogram
analysis
was
used
to
obtain
a truncated
film
thickness,
by excluding
values
greater
than
1.5 mm
film
thickness,
the mode,
and
a minimum
film

MIXING

CONCENTRATED
OIL-IN-WATER
EMULSIONS

In most
emulsions,
a density
difference
between
the dispersed
and the continuous
phases
leads
to
separation
of the components
by gravity,
known
as "creaming."
Typically,
a uniform
emulsion
is
desirable,
and hence
it is important
to examine
the kinetics
and mechanism
of emulsion
mixing
required
to achieve
this uniform
state.
In addition,
previous
mixing
research
has focused
on the
impact
of known
flow
fields
on the microstructure
of the
system,
where
the microstructures
do
not
modify
the flow
field
in the process.
In contrast,
in the case
of concentrated
emulsions,
it is
shown
here
that the evolution
of the nonuniform
droplet
concentration
profile
has a major
impact
on the observed
flow
field.
Mixing
of concentrated
oil-in-water
emulsions
in a horizontal,
concentric-cylinder
geometry
was
studied
using
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(NMRI).
The
NMRI
technique
provides
droplet
concentration
and
velocity
profiles
noninvasively
and
in
situ
within
a
flowing,
concentrated
emulsion
of
isooctane
and
water
stabilized
with
nonionic
surfactant.
An
initial
nonuniform
concentration
profile
is established
by
creaming
of a homogeneous
emulsion.
We
then
measure
the
time-dependent
effect
of
slow
shear
flow
on the
concentration
and
velocity
profiles.
Time-of-flight
and
chemical
shift
imaging
methods
were
used
to
measure
velocity
profiles
and concentration
maps
during
the mixing
process,
respectively.
The
results
obtained
show
detailed
information
about
the
mixing
process
in
concentrated
emulsions.
It was
found
that
the
thickness
of the cream
layer
remains
constant
during
mixing
while
the
concentration
in that
layer
decays
exponentially
as
a function
of
time.
It was
also
observed
that
while
mixing
occurs,
most
of the emulsion
is quiescent,
the only
detectable
motion
being
in
a thin
moving
layer
close
to
the
rotating
outer
cylinder
wall.
A
simple
model
is
introduced
that
is able
to give
a reasonable
explanation
of
these
experimental
observations.
These
results
indicate
that
the
mixing
mechanism
and
kinetics
in concentrated
emulsions
are
significantly
different
from
those
in single-phase
liquids.

A
NUMERICAL
METHOD
FOR
GAS-LIQUID
FLOWS
Y. Hao
and
A. Prosperetti
Department
of Mechanical
Engineering,
The
Johns
Hopkins
University
Baltimore
MD 21218
The
numerical
simulation
of two-phase
flow processes
with
heat
transfer
and
phase
change
requires
an
accurate
representation
of the
flow and
temperature
fields
near
gas-liquid
(or vapor-liquid)
interfaces.
This
circumstance
renders
rather
problematic
the use of several
existing
methods
in which
the interface
is smeared
over a few cells.
The
present
method
avoids
this
shortcoming
by maintaining
the interface
sharp
by means
of a suitably
modified
fl'ont-tracking
approach.
In addition,
the
compressibility
of the
gas or vapor
field
can
be
accounted
for,
and
realistic
density
ratios
can
be
used.
For
the
time
being,
the method
has
been
developed
and
tested
for three-dimensional
adiabatic
calculations.
It has
been
found
to perform
very
well,
and
its extension
to the
cncrgy
equation
is planned
for the
near
future.
The
salient
aspects
of the
method
are the following:
1.
We use a fixed
Cartesian
three-dimensional
grid
over which
the interface
moves.
We follow the
approach
of Tryggvason
and
co-workers
(see e.g.
Ref.
[1]) in discretizing
the free surface
by means
of triangular
finite
elements
the vertices
of which
are Lagrangian
points.
These
points
are advected
normally
to the
interface
with
a velocity
calculated
from
v(x, t)
=
/
d3y
5(x
- y) u(y, t)
(1)
where
u is the
liquid
velocity.
The
delta
distribution
5(x
- y)
is approximated
by a standard
regularized
form.
Again
as in Tryggvason's
work,
the liquid
region
is distinguished
from
the gas region
by solving
a Poisson
equation
for the indicator
function
I which
equals
+1
in the liquid
and
-1 in the gas:
V2I
=
V . (2 L
dSy
ia S(x - y))
,
(2)
in which
again
the delta
distribution
is regularized.
The
solution
of this
equation
gives a smooth
approxi-
mation
to I, but
the interface
can
be maintained
sharp
by focusing
on the
line where
the
function
changes
sign.
2.
In order
to be able
to use standard
differentiation
formulae
near
the interface,
the
liquid
velocity
field
is extrapolated
into
the
gas
region
by extending
to
three
dimensions
an
idea
of Popinet
& Zaleski
[2].
Specifically,
the
velocity
field
near
an
interface
point
y is approximated
by a linear
distribution,
u(x,
t) -_
u0 + T • (x -
y),
and
the
quantities
u0,
T are found
by a least
squares
fit incorporating
the
condition
of
vanishing
tangential
stress
by means
of of a Lagrange
multiplier.
3.
The
liquid
flow field is calculated
by means
of a first-order
projection
method.
In order
to facilitate
the
solution
of the
Poisson
equation
for the pressure,
the liquid
pressure
is extended
into
the gas region
by using
an
idea
similar
to
the
one
used
in the
Ghost
Fluid
method
[3]:
a fictitious
pressure
is defined
in the
gas
nodes
by using
the
actual
gas pressure
and
the jump
in the normal
stresses
caused
by surface
tension.
The
figures
demonstrate
the
performance
of the method
in a few cases.
In particular
the
last
example
shows
the
"swimming"
of a bubble
in microgravity
under
the action
of a modulated
liquid
velocity
including
the natural
frequency
of the n = 2 and
n = 3 shape
modes.

ABSTRACT
The
main
goal
of the project
is to obtain
new
experimental
data
and development
of models
on
the
co-current
and
counter-current
gas-liquid
two-phase
flow
through
a packed
bed
in
microgravity
and characterize
the flow
regime
transition,
pressure

void
and interfacial
area
distribution,
and
liquid

Experimental
data
will
be
obtained
for
earth
gravity
and
microgravity
conditions.
Models
will be
developed
for the prediction
of flow
regime
transition,
void

and
interfacial

which
are
key
parameters
to
characterize
the packed
bed performance.
Thus
the specific
objectives
of the proposed
research
are to: (1) Develop
experiments
for the study
of the gas liquid
two-phase
flow
through
the packed
bed with
three
different
flow
combinations:
co-current
down
flow,
co-current
upflow
and counter
current
flow.
(2) Develop
pore
scale
and bed
scale two-phase
instrumentation
for measurement
of
flow
regime
transition,
void
distribution
and
gas-liquid
interfacial
area
concentration
in the
packed
bed.
(3)
Obtain
database
on
flow
regime
transition,
pressure
drop,
void
distribution,
interfacial
area
concentration
and liquid
hold
up as a function
of bed characteristics
such
as bed
particle
size,
porosity,
and
liquid
properties
such
as viscosity
and
surface
tension.
(4) Develop
mathematical
model
for
flow
regime
transition,
void
fraction
distribution
and
interfacial
area
concentration
for co-current
gas-liquid
flow
through
the porous
bed in gravity
and micro
gravity
conditions.(4)
Develop
mathematical
model
for the flooding
phenomena
in counter-current
gas-
liquid
flow
through
the porous
bed in gravity
and micro
gravity
conditions.
The present
proposal
addresses
the most
important
topic
of HEDS-specific
microgravity
fluid
physics
research
identified
by NASA's
one
of the
strategic
enterprises,
OBPR
Enterprise.
The
proposed
project
is well
defined
and
makes
efficient
use
of the
ground-based
parabolic

research
aircraft
facility.
The
project
spans
for
four
years.
The
first
two
years
are devoted
to
ground
based
flight
definition
experimental
and modeling
program.
During
the next
two
years
microgravity
flight
tests
are carried
out using
the ground-based
parabolic
flight
research
aircraft.
The
experimental
program
consists
of a design
of a packed
bed loop
using
a scaling
analysis,
performing
experiments
for
various
parameters:
bed
diameter,
packing
size,
liquid
surface
tension,
and
liquid
viscosity.
Figure
1 shows
the
schematic
of
the test
loop.
A packed
bed
sections
of
15 cm
diameter
and
10 cm diameter
are
designed
with
sphere

particles
of
diameter,
6 mm
and
3 mm.
The
fluid
combination
used
are
: 1)water,

(50%,
80%

and
air,
and
(3)
glycerol-water
mixture
and

percent).
The loop
is instrumented
to provide
detailed
measurement
at pore
and
bed level
parameters.

The
electrohydrodynamic
(EHD)
phenomena
involve
the
interaction
of electric
fields
and
flow
fields
in a dielectric
fluid
medium.
There
are three
types
of EHD
pumps;
induction,
ion-
drag,
and
conduction.
EHD
conduction
pump
is a new
concept
which
has been
explored
only
recently.
Net
pumping
is achieved
by properly
utilizing
the heterocharge
layers
present
in the
vicinity
of the electrodes.
Several
innovative
electrode
designs
have
been
investigated.
This
paper
presents
an
electrode
design
that
generates
pressure
heads
on the order
of 600 Pa per one electrode
pair
at 20
kV
with
less
than
0.08
W of electric
power.
The
working
fluid
is the
Refrigerant
R-123.
An
EHD
conduction
pump
consisting
of six pairs
of
electrodes
is installed
in the
liquid
line
of a
mono-grove
heat pipe.
The
heat
transport
capacity
of the heat pipe
is measured
in the absence
and presence
of the
EHD
conduction
pump.
Significant
enhancements
in the heat
transport
capacity
of the heat pipe
is achieved
with
the EHD
conduction
pump
operating.
Furthermore,
the EHD
conduction
pump
provides
immediate
recovery
from
the dry-out
condition.
The
EHD
conduction
pump
has
many
advantages,
especially
in
the
micro-gravity
environment.
It is simple
in design,
non-mechanical,
and lightweight.
It provides
a rapid
control
of heat
transfer
in single-phase
and two-phase
flows.
The electric
power
consumption
is minimal
with the very low acoustic
noise
level.

ABSTRACT
Thermal
management
is an important
subsystem
in many
devices
and technologies
used
in a
microgravity
environment.
The
increased
power
requirements
of new
Space
technologies
and
missions
mean
that
the
capacity
and
efficiency
of
thermal

systems
must
be
improved.
The
current
work
addresses
this need
through
the investigation
and development
of a
direct
liquid
immersion
heat
transfer
cell for microgravity
applications.
The device
is based
on
boiling
heat transfer
enhanced
by two
fluidic
technologies
developed
at Georgia

The
first
of
these
fluidic
technologies,
called
vibration-induced
bubble
ejection,
is
shown
in Fig.
1.
Here,
an air bubble
in water
is
held
against
a
vibrating
diaphragm
by
buoyancy.
The
vibrations
at
440 Hz
induce
violent
oscillations
of
the
air/water
interface
that
can
result
in small
bubbles
being
ejected
from
the
larger
air
bubble
(Fig.
la)
and,
simultaneously,
the
collapse
of
the
air/water
interface
against
the
solid
surface
(Fig.
lb).
Both
effects
would
be
useful
during
a heat
transfer
process.
Bubble
ejection
would
force
vapor
bubbles
back
into the
cooler
liquid
so that
they
can
condense.
Interfacial
collapse
would
tend
to keep
the hot
surface
wet thereby
increasing
liquid
evaporation
and heat
transfer
to the
bulk liquid.
Figure

shows
the
effect
of
vibrating
the
solid
surface
at
7.6 kHz.
Here,
small-scale
capillary
waves
appear
on the surface
of the bubble
near
the attachment
point
on the solid
surface
(the
grainy
region).
The vibration
produces

surface,
thus
helping
to keep
the
solid
surface
wet
and increasing
the heat transfer.
The
second
fluidic
technology
to be
employed
in this
work
is a synthetic
j et, shown
schematically
in Fig. 3.
The
jet
is produced
using
a small,
sealed
cavity
with
a sharp-
edged
orifice
on one side
and a vibrating
diaphragm
on the
opposite
side.
The jet
is formed
when
fluid
is alternately
sucked
into
and
then
expelled
from
the
cavity
by
the
motion
of the diaphragm.
This
alternating
motion
means
that
there
is no
net
mass
addition
to the
system.
Thus,
there
is
no
need
for
input
piping
or
complex
fluidic
packaging.
The efficiency
of boiling
heat transfer
is hindered
in microgravity
because
there
is no inherent
mechanism
to remove
vapor
bubbles
from
the
heated
surface
(this
is the role
of buoyancy
on
Earth).
To circumvent
this
problem,
the
fluidic
technologies
described
above
will
be
used
to
develop
a nucleate
boiling
heat
transfer
cell for efficient,
high-flux
cooling
in microgravity.
The
cell
will
be
composed
of a liquid-filled
cavity
with
one
surface
attached
to the
surface
to be
cooled
and with
another
surface
attached
to an array
of heat
transfer
fins
or some
other
device
that
serves
to reject
the heat
to an outside
environment.
An array
of vibration
actuators
will be
designed
and fabricated
on the hot
surface.
These
actuators
will
aid nucleate
boiling
in the cell
by
vibration-induced
bubble
ejection
from
larger
vapor
bubbles
(Fig.
l a),
vibration-induced
collapse
of vapor
bubbles
against
the heated
surface
(Fig.
lb),
and the direct
removal
of vapor
bubbles
from
contact
with
the
heated
surface
(Fig. 2).
Synthetic
jets
placed
inside
the
cell
(Fig.
3) will produce
a flow
that
will
transport
vapor
bubbles
away
from
the heated
surface
into
the cooler
bulk
liquid.
Since
the synthetic
jets
operate
on time
scales
that
are much
shorter
than
the characteristic
thermal
time
scale
of the flow,
they
will
also
substantially
enhance
small-scale
mixing
within
the liquid,
thus
enhancing
the condensation
of vapor
bubbles
back
into the liquid
and the heat transfer
out of the cell.
The primary
objectives
of this research
are as follows.
1.
Develop,
design,
and
construct
a nucleate
boiling
heat
transfer
cell based
on the vibration-
induced
bubble
ejection
and synthetic-j
et technologies.
2.
Examine
the formation,
spreading,
and
detachment
of vapor
bubbles
from
a heated
surface
during
boiling
in microgravity.
3.
Determine
the
influence
of vibration
of the heated
surface
on the
spreading,
merging,
and
detachment
of vapor
bubbles
from
the surface.
4.
Determine
the vibration
conditions
that
maximize
the
interfacial
motion
of
a vapor
bubble
and that
ensure
its collapse
against
the heated
surface.
5.
Determine
the conditions
for the effective
use of forced
convection
induced
by synthetic
jets
to remove
vapor
bubbles
from
the heated
surface.
Both
experimental
and
numerical
work
will
be
done
during
this
investigation.
If these
technologies
behave
as expected,
the simplicity
and scalability
of the resulting
heat
transfer
cell
would
make
it a very
attractive
method
for thermal
management
in microgravity.
In addition,
the
technology
may
also
be transferable
to Earth-based,
boiling
applications
and provide
improved
performance
over normal
pool-boiling
technologies.

Using Surfactantsto Control BubbleGrowth and Coalescence
K. Stebe
JohnsHopkins University
The effectsof surfactantadsorption on bubble formation at anorifice arestudied
numerically at finite Reynolds number.
Establishing the hydrodynamics and
masstransfer during bubble growth and detachmentwill improve insight into
the nucleateboiling processand aid in developing paradigms for enhancement
of the heat transfer coefficient during nucleate boiling. The volume-of-fluid
method is employed to solve the two-dimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes
equations.The interfaceis tracked using marker points that accuratelyrepresent
the surfacetension forcesat the interface.The evolution and detachmentof the
bubble is examined as a function of the capillary and Bond numbers. At low
surface tension, strong deformations of the interface are observedleading to
bubbles that assumea mushroom shape. Surfactantschangethe surfacetension
according to a non-linear equation of state that takes into account maximum
packing at the interface. A variety of behaviors are predicted, depending upon
the ratio of the convection rate to the prevailing mass transfer rates.
In
particular, if theseratesare comparable,regions of local surfactantaccumulation
develop where the surfactant concentrationapproachesits upper bound, causing
the local surfacetension to reduce strongly and rendering the interface highly
deformable.

ABSTRACT
The
objective
of this research,
which
began
in April
2002,
is to develop
and experimentally
validate
a near-critical
transcritical
and
supercritical
fluid
shear
flow
model
independent
of
turbulence.
We
define
a supercritical
shear
flow
to be
one
in which
all of the
fluid
particles
remain
above
their
critical
temperature
and
pressure.
We
define
a transcritical
shear
flow
to
be
one
in
which
at
least
some
of
the
fluid
particles
undergo
a
transition
between
a
_
subcritical
and
a
supercritical
temperature,
between
a subcritical
and a supercritical
pressure,
or both.
The reason
it is necessary
to validate
the
fluid
model
independent
of
turbulence
is
that
.....................
turbulence
introduces
a
large
number
of
additional
mechanisms
the
understanding
of
which
is
embryonic
at
best
for
near-critical
transcritical
and
supercritical
flows.
Validating
the
fluid
model
without
turbulence
uncertainties
therefore
requires
laminar
flows.
However,
laminar
flows
that
are not
influenced
by gravity
are difficult
to produce
in normal
gravity
due to
the
large
density
gradients
involved.
Therefore,
microgravity
experiments
are necessary.
The
co-investigators
have
considerable
experience
modeling
supercritical
mixing
and
shear
layers
(JPL),
and
considerable
experience
in
performing
transcritical
and
supercritical
droplet
and
jet
experiments
in
normal
gravity
(AFRL/ERC).
This
experience
will be applied
to
perform
a microgravity
experiment
where
the
results
can
be
directly
compared
with

Experimental
Approach
Liquid
nitrogen
(LN2)
initially
below
the
critical
temperature
will
be
injected
into
room
temperature
gaseous
nitrogen
(GN2)
and
GNz/He
mixtures
at various
subcritical
to
supercritical
pressures.
AFRL/ERC
has
considerable
previous
experience
with
these
mixtures
under
normal
gravity,
and
the
substances
are inherently
safe.
A
conceptual
design
of
the
drop
tower
rig
is
illustrated
in Fig.
1. Two separate
chambers,
one for LN2,
and the other
for the ambient
fluid,
are connected
through
Figure

a one-way
valve
and a cryo-solenoid
valve.
The LN2 chamber
is an insulated
dewar
with
several
inlet
and
outlet
passages
as shown.
Injection
is achieved
through
pressurized
He gas exerted
on
the upper
side
of a small
piston
inside
the chamber.
Injection
initiation
is controlled
by the Cryo-
solenoid-valve
#3. The high
pressure
chamber
will be
designed
to have
optical
access
for
flow
visualization.
The
entire
setup
will be designed
to withstand
the total
stresses
caused
by internal
pressure
and decelerating
inertia
forces.
The volumes
of the chambers
are selected
based
on the
test
periods
of less
than
2.2
seconds
and the range
of flow
rates
desired
to produce
a range
of
Reynolds
numbers,
with
minimal
pressure
rise
during
a test.
Several
ways
to
measure
the
instantaneous
flow
rates
have
been
discussed,
including
the
method
shown
in Fig.
1, where
piston
motion
is
detected
by
a diode
laser
and
linear
array
optical
array
arrangement.
The
experimental
procedure
will
be to complete
chill
down
and establish
the flow
before
the
drop.
Estimates
confirm
that there
should
be ample
time
for the flow to relax
from
1 g to/,tg
before
the
end of the drop.
Theoretical
Approach
The
theoretical
approach
includes
real-gas
equations
of
state,
conservation
equations
that
account
for Soret
and
Dufour
effects,
and accurate
transport
properties.
This model
has
already
been
validated
with
suspended-drop
microgravity
data.
Preliminary
simulations
of
a forced,
laminar
heptane/nitrogen
mixing
layer
yielded
encouraging
results
when
compared
to
experimental
observations
of supercritical
jets.
An example
of the simulation
results
is depicted
in
Fig.
2
showing
the
magnitude
of
the
density
gradient,
which
is
pertinent
to
optical
measurements:
the finger-like
features
detected
in the
simulations
qualitatively
replicate
some
features
observed
experimentally
[3].
Further
studies
will
focus
on using
the
same
fluids
in
simulations
and experiments,
and performing
simulations
and observations
at same
conditions.

This
is the first
progress
report
on a recently-initiated
research
project
aiming
to a basic
understanding
of Boiling
Crisis
in forced
convection
boiling.
The
work
is a continuation
and
extension
of
a project
that
addressed
coolability
limits
in pool
boiling
carried
out
over
the
previous
funding
cycle.
A key
result
of this
previous
work
was
the
identification
of a scales
separation
phenomenon,
that
effectively
"isolates"
the microhydrodnamics
on the heater
surface
from
the chaotic
two-phase
flow
motions
away from
it. This
separation
is effected
by a persistent
very
high
void
fraction
region
(like
a vapor
"blanket"),
and
it is of
immense
significance
in
allowing
to focus
the
physics
of a long-standing
apparently
intractable
problem
(Theofanous
et
al., 2002a,b).
We
expect
that
such
a separation
of scales
would
be present
also
in convective
boiling,
especially
in the low flow
rates
regimes
that
are of interest
in space
applications,
so the subject
is
pursued
as a key
component
of the present
effort
as well.
In this report
we
describe
our efforts
towards
a more
precise
and detailed
characterization
as needed
to elucidate
the key mechanisms
for both pool
and convective
boiling
geometries.
The
region
of
interest
extends
from
outside
the
microlayer,
undulating
on
the
heater
surface
(10s
of
microns),
up
to a few
millimeters
away
from
it.
This
requires
high
spatial
resolution
in the vertical
dimension
over
the whole
horizontal
macroscopic
dimension
needed
to
reveal
the
pattern
(the
whole
2.5
cm
x 4 cm
surface
area
of
the
heater),
and
obviously
the
measurement
must
be non-intrusive.
Our previous
work
demonstrated
the value
and potential
of
the
X-ray
radiography
technique
for
this
purpose
(Theofanous
et
al., 2002a, b).
The
point
of
departure
here
is consideration
of scattered
X-rays,
associated
improvements
to our test
section
and
radiography
imaging
techniques
including
positioning,
collimating,
and
film/intensifier
choice
and
development.
Further,
the
work
included
extensive
calibrations,
especially
using
"ghosts"
of known
and
similar
(but
static)
material
configurations.
Of special
importance
was
the replacement
of the glass
wall
of our test section
by pieces
made
of KAPTON
material.
Sample
results
are shown
in Figure
1.
The radiographs
depict
projections
over the narrow
dimension
of the test
section
(2.6
mm)
and the
gray
scales
show
local
(in 2D,
heights--width)
void
fraction
distributions
and
their
variation
with
heat
flux.
Ensemble
averages
can
be
constructed
from
such
images
taken
repeatedly.
The line diagram
shows
the results
of horizontal
averaging
of these
radiographs
--- that
is, area
averages
over horizontal
planes
as function
of their
distance
from
the heater.
The high void
fraction
region
is seen to be well
established
at heat flux
levels
over
-700
kW/m 2.
Closer
examination
can reveal
further
details
on the internal
structures
of this important
region.

This
is the first
progress
report
on a recently-initiated
research
project
aiming
to a basic
understanding
and prediction
of the Boiling
Crisis
phenomenon
in convective
boiling.
The work
is a continuation
and
extension
of a project
that
addressed
coolability
limits
in pool
boiling
and
was
carried
out over
the previous
funding
cycle.
A key ingredient
of our approach
is the use of
high
speed,
high
resolution
infrared
imaging
in conjunction
with
nanofilm
(in thickness)
heaters
of macroscopic
dimensions
to detect
the evolution
of thermal
patterns
at the solid-fluid
interface.
In
particular
the
configuration
allows
the
detection
of
bubble
nucleation
events,
and
it has
permitted
the first
direct
determination
of bubble
nucleation
densities
in high
heat
flux
boiling
(Theofanous
et al, 2002a).
This
work
established
a strong
connection
of the surface
nucleation
characteristics
and
it's resistance
to burnout
(Theofanous
et al 2000b),
so
nucleation
is pursued
as
a key component
of the present
effort
on convective
boiling
as well.
The point
of departure
is a further
finding
of
this
work
that
nucleation
on
nanoscopically
smooth
(+4
nm
rms
roughness)
surfaces
is not
consistent
with
the
apparently
(and
firmly)
established
preexisting
cavity
nucleation
theory
(PEN)
as propounded
by Zeldovich
(1943),
Dean
(1944),and
Bankoff
(1958),
and
elaborated
more
recently
by
Wang
and
Dhir
(1993).
More
specifically
our
work
points
to
surface
nanomorphology
and
chemistry
at the
origin
of heterogeneous
nucleation,
thus
leading
us to
question
whether
there
is any role
left to "roughness"
(as conceived
in PEN),
even
for
rough,
engineering
surfaces.
Thus,
in this nucleation-focus
portion
of our project,
the domain
of interest
includes
all
kinds
of
surfaces,
rough
and
"dirty"
ones
as
found
in
traditional
engineering
equipment,
as well
as ultrasmooth
and
"clean"
ones
as found
in new
micro
scale
technologies
such
as cooling
of microelectronic
equipment,
and operation
of micro
fluidic
devices.
In this report
we present
the results
of our first steps
in addressing
the potential
role
of
"'roughness".
The idea is that this role can be isolated
by using
nanofilms
on preroughened
glass
substrates.
Using
precision
sandblasting
we
can
create
micron-scale
roughnesses
that
resemble
those
of
common
engineering
surfaces.
On
the
other
hand,
using
metal
vapor
deposition
techniques,
we
can
build
films
(on
these
substrates)
with
chemistries
and
nanomorphologies
precisely
similar
to those
found
on our smooth
nanofilms
of our previous
work.
All other
aspects
of the
experimental
apparatus
and
diagnostics
are
also
the same.
Experiments
are
conducted
either
on
a pulse-heating
mode,
where
a significant
change
in heat
flux
is instantaneously
imposed,
or
in
a
steady-state
mode,
where
heating
is
changed
by
small
increments
(or
decrements).
Sample
results
are shown
on Figures
1 and 2. The gray scales
are in degree
cemtigrade.

ABSTRACT
Direct numerical
simulations
are used to examine
the
effect
of electric
fields
on the behavior
of a
suspensions
of drops
in channels.
The
effect
of
the
electric
field
is modeled
using
the
"leaky
dielectric"
model,
coupled
with
the
full
Navier-Stokes
equations.
The
goveming
equations
are
solved
using
a front-tracking/finite
volume
technique.
The method
has been
validated
by
detailed
comparison
with previous
results
for the axisymmetric
interactions
of two drops
in Stokes
flow.
An
extensive
set
of two-dimensional
simulations
has
allowed
us to
explore
the
effect
of
the
conductivity
and permittivity
ratios
in some
detail.
The interaction
of two
drops
is controlled
by
two
effects.
The
drops
are driven
together
due to the
charge
distribution
on the
surface.
Since
the net
charge
of the
drops
is zero,
the
drops
see each other
as dipoles.
This
dielectrophoretic
motion
always
leads
to drops
attraction.
The
second
effect
is fluid
motion
driven
by tangential
stresses
at
the
fluid
interface.
The
fluid
motion
depends
on
the
relative
magnitude
of
the
permittivity
and conductivity
ratios.
When
the permittivity
ratio
is higher
than
the conductivity
ratio,
the tangential
forces
induce
flow
from
the poles
of the drops
to the equator.
If the center
of
two such
drops
lies on a line parallel
to the electric
field,
the flow
drains
from
the
region
between
the drops
and they
attract
each
other.
When
the ratios
are equal,
no tangential
motion
is induced
and the drops
attract
each
other
by dielectrophoretic
motion.
When
an electric
field
is applied
to
many
drops
suspended
in a channel
flow,
drops
first
attract
each
other
pair-wise
and some
drops
move
to
the
wall.
If the
forces
are strong
(compared
to the
fluid
shear)
the
drops
can
form
columns
or
fibers,
spanning
the
channel
and
blocking
the
two-dimensional
flow.
Electronic
"fibration"
of suspensions
has been
observed
in a number
of systems,
including
dispersion
of
milk
droplets
and red blood
cells.
If the
attractive
forces
are weak
compared
to the
shear,
the
columns
are
immediately
broken
up.
For
drops
with
the
permittivity
ratio
lower
than
the
conductivity
ratio,
the tangential
forces
induce
flow
in the opposite
direction
(from
the equator
to
the poles
of the drops)
and if the induced
fluid
motion
is sufficiently
strong,
the
drops
repel
each
other.
In two-dimensions,
this
results
in interactions
between
the
drops
that
are similar
to
the
previous
case,
except
that the attractions
take place
perpendicular
to the electric
field.
The
drops
therefore
tend
to form
rows
aligned
with the
flow,
or "slugs"
where
many
drops
clump
together.
When
the conductivity
ratio
is much
higher
than
the permittivity
ratio,
the drops
become
prolate,
expel
each
other
and are spread
more
uniformly
across
the
channel.

frames

of 36 drops
in a channel.

After
the electric
field
is turned
on, the pairwise
interactions
of drops
initially
leads
to the
formation
of drop
pairs
and columns
of drops
parallel

The drops
are also
attracted
to
the walls
by the
same
mechanism
that
drops
are attracted
to each
other
and
eventually
all the
drops
migrate
to the
walls.
In this
case
the drops
are not
allowed
to coalesce,
but
in reality
we
would
expect
the drops
to form
fluid layers
next
to the walls.
While
the
two-dimensional
simulations
have
allowed
us
to
conduct
a large
number
of
simulations
relatively
inexpensively,
and explore
a large range
of conductivity
and
permittivity
ratios,
it
is
clear
that
fully
three-
dimensional
systems
are
needed
for
quantitative
predictions.
We have
developed
a fully
parallel
code
to
examine
three-dimensional
systems.
Preliminary
simulations
for
oblate
drops
show
that
the
results
are
similar
to the two-dimensional
ones,

that
the rate
of
accumulation
at

is
slower.

ABSTRACT
Nucleate
pool
boilng
performance
of different
liquids
on graphite-copper
composite
(Gr-Cu)
surfaces
has
been
experimentally
studied
and
modeled.
Both
highly
wetting
fluids,
such
as freon-113
and pentane,
and a moderately
wetting
fluid
(water)
were
tested
on
the
Gr-Cu
surfaces
with
different
graphite-fiber
volume
fractions
to
reveal
the
enhancement
effects
of the composite
surfaces
on the nucleate
pool
boiling.
Results
of
the experiments
show
that
the graphite-fiber
volume
fraction
has an optimum
value.
The
Gr-Cu
composite
surface
with 25 percent
graphite-fiber
volume
(0=0.25)
has a maximum
enhancement
effect
on the
nucleate
boiling
heat
transfer
comparing
to the
pure
copper
surface.
For
the
highly
wetting
fluid,
the
nucleate
boiling
heat
transfer
is generally
enhanced
on the Gr-
Cu composite
surfaces
by 3 to 6 times,
as shown
in Fig. 1. In the low
heat
flux
region,
the
enhancement
is over
6 times,
but
in the high
heat
flux
region,
the
enhancement
is reduced
to about
40%.
For the moderately
wetting
fluid
(water),
stronger
enhancement
of nucleate
boiling
heat
transfer
is achieved
on
the
composite
surface.
Figure
2 depicts
the experimental
results
in which
one observes
the nucleate
boiling
heat
transfer
enhancement
of 5 to 10 times
in the low heat
flux
region
and an enhancement
of
3 to 5 times
in the high heat flux region.
Photographs
of bubble
departure
during
the initial
stage
of nucleate
boiling
indicate
that
the bubbles
detached
from
the composite
surface
are much
smaller
in diameter
than
those
detached
from
the pure
copper
surface.
Typical
photographs
are presented
in Fig. 3.
It is seen
in Fig.3(a)
that
the bubbles
departed
from
the composite
surface
have
diameters
of only
O(0.1)
mm,
while
those
departed
from
the pure
copper
surface
have
diameters
of
O(1)
mm,
as seen
in Fig. 3 (b).
It is also
found
that the bubbles
depart
from
the composite
surface
at a much
higher
frequency,
thus
forming
vapor
columns,
as seen
in Fig.3
(a).
These
two phenomena
combined
with high
thermal
conductivity
of the graphite
fiber
are
considered
the mechanisms
for such
a significant
augmentation
in nucleate
boiling
heat
transfer
on the composite
surfaces.
A physical
model
is developed
to describe
the phenomenon
of bubble
departure
from
the composite
surface:
The preferred
site of bubble
nucleation
is
the fiber
tip because
of
higher
tip
temperature
than
the
surrounding
copper
base
and
poor
wettability
of
the
graphite
tip compared
with
that
of the base
material
(copper).
The high
evaporation
rate
near
the
contact
line
produces
the
vapor
cutback
due
to the
vapor
recoil
pushing
the
three-phase
line
outwards
from
the fiber
tip,
and so a neck
of the bubble
is formed
near
the bubble
bottom.
Evaporation
and
surface
tension
accelerate
the necking
process
and
finally
result
in the bubble
departure
while
a new
small
bubble
is formed
at the tip when
the
surface
tension
pushes
the
three-phase
line
back
to
the
tip.
The
process
is

BLOOD
CELL
MIGRATION
IN
PRESSURE-DRIVEN
AND
ELECTROKINETIC
FLOWS

ABSTRACT
We
report
our preliminary
results
on the transverse
migration
of red
blood
cells
and other
particles
when
they
are driven
electrokinetically
and by pressure-driven
flows
in micro-channels.
The
overall
objective
is to explain
the Fahraeus-Lindqvist
effect
in blood
circulation
dynamics-
blood
cells
tend
to migrate
and aggregate
at the blood
vessel
axis and reduce
the overall
viscous
dissipation
in the process.
At the same
hematocrit
(blood
cell concentration),
blood
cell
flux
at
smaller
capillaries
is higher
than
in the large
ones
because
of this
effect.
To
avoid
blood
cell
accumulation
and depletion,
the physiological
dynamics
maintain
the hematocrit
for small
vessels
at a level
significantly
lower
than
that
in larger
ones.
However,
the migration
disappears
for
capillary
radii
beyond
250 microns.
Hence,
hematocrit
is uniform
within
large
blood
vessels
above
this
cutoff
radius.
This
curious
micro-circulation
phenomenon
has not been
satisfactorily
explained
and is the focus
of our research.
Once
the transverse
migration
mechanisms
for blood
cells
and other
micro-particles
are understood,
we also
intend
to exploit
the principles
to design
electrophoretic
and flow
separation
methods
for micro-particles,
including
blood
cells.
We
drive
mouse
blood
and human
blood
suspensions
in a mm-size
capillary
and
a Hele-
Shaw
slot
with
a mm-size
gap.
They
are driven
by both
a pressure-driven
flow
applied
by a
syringe
and an electrokinetic
flow
due to a longitudinal
electric
field of about
50 V/cm.
Significant
lateral
migration
and aggregation
are only observed
in the former
for both
concentrated
and dilute
suspensions.
For
dilute
blood
suspensions,
the bi-convex
doughnut-shaped
blood
cells
form
a
single
file with their
axis roughly
aligned
in the direction
of flow.
Some
precession
about
this axis
is observed
in a Hele-Shaw
slot. In electrokinetic
flow,
there
is a very thin depleted
marginal
layer
of less than
a micron
but
otherwise
no blood
cell segregation/migration
is observed.
Since
the
electro-osmotic
flow
field
is shear-free
away
from
the Debye
layer,
we
conclude
that
lateral
migration
is only possible
in the presence
of bulk
shear.
However,
migration
is not observed
in pressure-driven
flow
experiments
with
ion-exchange
granules
of dimensions
similar
to blood
cells.
A preliminary
scaling
analysis
suggests
that
the
migration
is only
possible
with
bulk
shear,
particle
deformation
and
non-spherical
geometry.
Inertia
is ruled
out
due to the miniscule
particle
Reynolds
number.
Without
deformation,
an
ellipsoid
is shown
to rotate
in the vorticity
direction
but the net lateral
hydrodynamic
force
is
zero.
The migration
scenario
is quite
different,
however,
if an electric
field
is applied
and
if the
particles
are charged.
The
Maxwell
stress
can
also
impart
a torque
on an asymmetric
particle.
However,
the
direction
of
this
torque
exerted
by
the
electrokinetic
stress
depends
on
the
inclination
of the ellipsoid
whereas
that
from
the
bulk
hydrodynamic
shear
depends
on
the
NASA/T_2002-211211
201

vorticity
of
the
bulk
velocity
field.
This
vorticity
changes
sign
across
the
capillary
axis.
Consequently,
if
electrophoretic
motion
and
hydrodynamic
shear
are both
present,
the
two
torques
can balance
at a particular
equilibrium
inclination
angle
that
is not
parallel
to the flow
direction.
This
angle
is also
different
for different
hydrodynamic
vorticities.
We hence
predict
a
preferred
inclination
angle
for a rigid
ellipsoid
that
is driven
electro-phoretically
in a pressure-
driven
flow
field.
This
non-zero
angle
also
implies
a net
migration
even
for
rigid
particles.
Preliminary
experimental
evidence
of this new
migration
mechanism
will also
be reported.
Since
blood
cells
possess
significant
surface
charge,
their
electrophoretic
motion
in the presence
of a
shear
flow is quite
different
from
that
of a pure pressure-driven
flow.
We have
also investigated
the transport
of blood
cells by AC dielectrophoresis
at hundreds
of
kilo
Hz.
A
sub-millimeter
electrode
configuration
is
designed
to
produce
a non-uniform
AC
electric
field.
The blood
cells are observed
to polarize
in the AC field and aggregate
along the field
lines.
They
then
migrate
slowly
across
the field
lines
towards
regions
of low electric
fields,
as is
the case
in classical
dielectrophoresis.
Like
all nonlinear
electrokinetic
phenomena,
the
dipole
formation
and the migration
are both
frequency
and particle
size
dependent.
We have
exploited
these
properties
to separate
large
fish blood
cells
from
smaller
mouse
cells.
However,
unlike
the
classical
dielectrophoresis,
the polarization
that
occurs
in the plasma
electrolyte
around
the blood
cell is quite
different
from
that of a dielectric
liquid.
The high frequency
required
is expected
to be
due to the small
migration/diffusive
time
of ions
across
the blood
cell Debye
layer.
A parallel
theory
is being
pursued
to explain
this nonlinear
AC electrokinetic
phenomenon
of blood
cells.
The
theory
captures
the
migration
of ions
within
the Debye
layer
that
causes
the polarization
responsible
for
aggregation
and
drift
out
of the field
lines.
It extends
the classical
theories
for
dielectrophoresis
from
dielectric
liquids
to electrolytes.

ABSTRACT
In
recent
years,
there
has
been
increased
interest
in
investigating
spontaneous
pattern
formation
in suspensions
of motile
microorganisms.
This
phenomenon
is called
bioconvection.
Different
from
solid
particles
in
traditional
multiphase
flow
systems,
motile
cells
are
self-
propelled.
These
microorganisms
propel
themselves
by
rotating
flagella
which
are
driven
by
reversible
molecular
motors
that are embedded
in the cell wall.
They
tend
to swim
in a particular
direction
in response
to certain
stimuli
such
as gravity
(gravitaxis),
light
(phototaxis),
or chemical
gradients
(chemotaxis).
This
investigation
deals
with
bioconvection
in
a
suspension
of
gyrotactic
motile
microorganisms.
Gyrotaxes
is
a
behavior
typical
for
algal
suspensions.
The
direction
of
swimming
of gyrotactic
microorganisms
is determined
by the balance
of two
torques.
The
first
one
is the
viscous
torque
that
acts
on a body
placed
in
a shear
flow.
The
second
torque
is
generated
by gravity
because
the center
of mass
of a typical
microorganism
is displaced
from
its
center
of buoyancy.
The
microorganisms
considered
in this
paper
are heavier
than
water
and
gyrotactic
behavior
results
in their
swimming
towards
the
regions
of
most
rapid
downflow.
Because
of that,
the regions
of downflow
become
denser
than
the regions
of upflow.
Buoyancy
increases
the upward
velocity
in the regions
of upflow
and downward
velocity
in the regions
of
downflow,
thus
enhancing
the velocity
fluctuations.
The formation
of almost
regular
patterns
and
gyrotactic
plumes
in algal
suspensions
has been
documented
in numerous
experimental
papers.
This
instability
is similar
to the Rayleigh-Benard
convection
instability
but its development
does
not require
the vertical
temperature
gradient.
Despite
the
large
number
of
publications
on
bioconvection
in
suspensions
of
gyrotactic
microorganisms,
very
little
has
been
done
to
address
this
type
of
bioconvection
in
a fluid
saturated
porous
medium.
This
phenomenon
is
important
because
it
may
occur
in
nature
(bioconvection
in
a layer
of
sand
at
the
floor
of
a body
of
water
that
contains
gyrotactic
microorganisms)
and may
also
have
numerous
applications.
Upswimming
of algal
cells
can be
utilized
to
concentrate
the
cells,
purify
cultures,
and
separate
vigorously
swimming
subpopulations.
For
these
applications,
bioconvection
is undesirable,
because
it would
prevent
up-swimming
cells
from
concentrating
near
the surface
of the culture.
To suppress
bioconvection,
a porous
medium
(for
example,
a surgical
cotton
wool)
can
be
utilized,
which
must
be
sufficiently
permeable
to allow
cells
to swim
through
it but
also
sufficiently
fight
to damp
out
NASA/T_2002-211211
205

bioconvection.
For
practical
purposes,
it is desirable
to have
the
permeability
of
the
porous
medium
as high
as possible.
This would
insure
that
the cells
can swim
through
it without
cutting
their
tails
off and this will also maximize
the flux of the cells
in the upward
direction.
Numerical
results
suggest
that
there
is
a
critical
value
of
the
permeability
of
a porous
medium.
If
permeability
is smaller
than
this critical
value,
bioconvection
does not
occur
and microorganisms
simply
swim
in
the
upward
direction;
if
it is
larger
than
the
critical
value,
bioconvection
instability
develops.
The purpose
of this research
is to obtain
the exact
expression
for the critical
permeability
based
on a full three-dimensional
stability
analysis.
As a result
of this investigation,
it is established
that
an infinite
uniform
dilute
suspension
of
gyrotactic
microorganisms
in a fluid
saturated
porous
medium
is stable
if the permeability
of the
porous
medium
is sufficiently
small.
A critical
value
of the permeability
exists
and if a porous
medium
has larger permeability
than this critical
value,
the suspension
is unstable.
By performing
a liner
stability
analysis,
an analytical
expression

It is established
that
increasing
the
cell

fluid
viscosity
increases
critical
permeability,

increasing
the number

volume
of the cell,

and
the average

the critical

This

ABSTRACT
An
important
component
in biotechnology,
particularly
in the area
of protein
engineering
and
rational
drug
design
is the
knowledge
of the precise
three-dimensional
molecular
structure
of
proteins.
The
quality
of
structural
information
obtained
from
X-ray
diffraction
methods
is
directly
dependent
on the
degree
of perfection
of the protein
crystals.
As
a consequence,
the
growth
of high
quality
macromolecular
crystals
for diffraction
analyses
has been
the central
focus
for biochemists,
biologists,
and bioengineers.
Macromolecular
crystals
are
obtained
from
solutions
that
contain
the
crystallizing
species
in
equilibrium
with
higher
aggregates,
ions,
precipitants,
other
possible
phases
of
the
protein,
foreign
particles,
the walls
of the container,
and
a likely
host
of other
impurities.
By changing
transport
modes
in general,
i.e.,
reduction
of convection
and
sedimentation,
as is achieved
in
"microgravity",
researchers
have
been
able to dramatically
affect
the movement
and distribution
of
macromolecules
in
the
fluid,
and
thus
their
transport,
formation
of
crystal
nuclei,
and
adsorption
to the
crystal
surface.
While
a limited
number
of high
quality
crystals
from
space
flights
have
been
obtained,
as the recent
National
Research
Council
(NRC)
review
of the NASA
microgravity
crystallization
program
pointed
out,
the
scientific
approach
and
research
in
crystallization
of proteins
has been
mainly
empirical
yielding
inconclusive
results
[1].
We postulate
that we can reduce
convection
in ground-based
experiments
and we can understand
the
different
aspects
of convection
control
through
the
use
of strong
magnetic
fields
and
field
gradients.
Whether
this limited
convection
in a magnetic
field
will provide
the environment
for
the growth
of high
quality
crystals
is still
a matter
of conjecture
that
our research
will
address.
The
approach
exploits
the variation
of fluid
magnetic
susceptibility
with
concentration
for this
purpose
and the convective
damping
is realized
by appropriately
positioning
the crystal
growth
cell so that
the magnetic
susceptibility
force
counteracts
terrestrial
gravity.
The general
objective
is to test the hypothesis
of convective
control
using
a strong
magnetic
field
and
magnetic
field
gradient
and
to understand
the
nature
of the various
forces
that
come
into
play.
Specifically
we
aim
to
delineate
causative
factors
and
to
quantify
them
through
experiments,
analysis
and
numerical
modeling.
Once
the
basic
understanding
is obtained,
the
study
will focus
on testing
the hypothesis
on proteins

proteins
E1 and
E3.
Obtaining
high
crystal
quality
of these
proteins
is of great
importance
to
structural
biologists
since
their
structures
need
to be determined.
Specific
goals
for the investigation
are:
1.
To develop
an understanding
of convection
control
in diamagnetic
fluids
with
concentration
gradients
through
experimentation
and
numerical
modeling.
Specifically
solutal
buoyancy
driven
convection
due to crystal
growth
will be considered.
2.
To
develop
predictive
measures
for
successful
crystallization
in
a magnetic
field
using
analyses
and numerical
modeling
for
use in future
protein
crystal
growth
experiments.
This
will establish
criteria
that can be used
to estimate
the efficacy
of magnetic
field
flow damping
on crystallization
of candidate
proteins.
3.
To demonstrate
the understanding
of convection
damping
by high
magnetic
fields
to a class
of proteins
that
is of interest
and whose
structure
is as yet not determined.
4.
To compare
quantitatively,
the
quality
of the
grown
crystals
with
and
without
a magnetic
field.
X-ray
diffraction
techniques
will be used
for the comparative
studies.
In
a preliminary
set
of
experiments,
we
studied
crystal
dissolution
effects
in a 5 Tesla
magnet
available
at NASA
Marshall
Space
Flight
Center
(MSFC).
Using
a Schlieren
setup,
a lmm
crystal
of
Alum
(Aluminum-Potassium
Sulfate)
was introduced
in a 75%
saturated
solution
and the resulting
dissolution
plume
was observed.
The experiment
was conducted
both
in the presence
and absence
of
a magnetic
field
gradient.
The magnet
produces
a gradient
field
of
~ 1 Tesla2/cm.
Image
analysis
of
the recorded
images
indicated
an enhanced
plume
velocity
that was of the order
of the measurement
limit.
For
this experiment,
both
the gradient
and gravity
fields
are in the same
direction
resulting
in
an enhanced
effective
gravity
that tends
to accelerate
the observed
plume
velocity.
While
the results
are not conclusive,
pending
further
tests,
it clearly
points
out
the inadequacy
of the MSFC
magnet
for
conducting
protein
crystallization
experiments
and
the need
for
a stronger
magnet.
In space-
based
experiments,
however,
where
the
gravitational
effects
are small,
only
a weak
magnetic
field
will be required
to control
or mitigate
the effects
of convective
contamination.
The
typical
magnetic
field
- field
gradient
product
required
to balance
thermal
buoyancy
for
a
diamagnetic
fluid
is given
as BOB/0z
~ 12.5
TeslaZ/cm,
where
B is the magnetic
induction
and z
is the vertical
coordinate.
The
field
gradient
product
required
for countering
solutal
buoyancy
is
BOB/Oz
~ 14 TeslaZ/cm.
These
fields
are
realizable
in large
magnets.
We
plan
to do the
first
series
of experiments
to
test
the
flow
control
hypothesis
at the
National
High
Magnet
Field
Laboratory
in Tallahassee,
Florida,
in Aug.
2002.

ABSTRACT
The
flow
through
arrays
of fixed
obstacle
beds
provides
important
new
methods
for
creating
microstructural
dynamics
of
drops
and
flexible
macromolecules.
In
the
latter
instance,
new
separation
techniques
for
DNA
have
been
suggested
based
on the mobility
change
that
comes
from
interactions
with
obstacles
during
flow
(either
electrophoretically
driven
or
hydrodynamically
driven
motion).
Interestingly,
the dynamics
is so diverse
in terms
of variation
with obstacle
concentration,
strength
of flow
driving
force,
and molecular
length,
that large-scale
simulation
can
play
a very
important
role
in
determining
where
interesting
flow
parameter
regimes
are located.
In this
poster,
we will
present
large-scale
simulations
of drops
and DNA
moving
through
fiber
obstacle
arrays.
We
will
discuss
the
breakup
mechanisms
that
are
engendered
in the former
and compare
our results
to ongoing
experiments.
In the latter
instance
we will
discuss
the efficiency
of separation
in these
arrays
and isolate
parameter
regimes
where
separation
is most
efficient.

ABSTRACT
Experiments
have
shown
that
a low-density
jet
injected
into
a high-density
surrounding
medium
undergoes
periodic
oscillations
in the near
field.
Although
the flow
oscillations
in these
jets
at
Richardson
numbers
about
unity
are
attributed
to
the
buoyancy,
the
direct
physical
evidence
has
not
been
acquired
in the
experiments.
If the
instability
were
indeed
caused
by
buoyancy,
the near-field
flow
structure
would
undergo
drastic
changes
upon
removal
of gravity
in the microgravity
environment.
The present
study
was
conducted
to investigate
this
effect
by
simulating
microgravity
environment
in the 2.2-second
drop
tower
at the NASA
Glenn
Research
Center.
The non-intrusive,
rainbow
schlieren
deflectometry
technique
was
used
for quantitative
measurements
of helium
concentrations
in buoyant
and non-buoyant
jets.
Results
in a steady
jet show
that
the radial
growth
of the jet
shear
layer
in Earth
gravity
is
hindered
by
the buoyant
acceleration.
The jet
in microgravity
was
30 to 70 percent
wider
than
that in Earth
gravity.
The
microgravity
jet
showed
typical
growth
of a constant
density
jet shear
layer.
In case
of a self-excited
helium
jet in Earth
gravity,
the flow
oscillations
continued
as the
jet
flow
adjusted
to
microgravity
conditions
in
the
drop
tower.
The
flow
oscillations
were
however
not
present
at the end
of the
drop
when
steady
microgravity
conditions
were
reached.
The
oscillations
in Earth
gravity
were
confirmed
by a dominant
frequency
of 12.2
Hz at several
jet
locations
as shown
by
the power
spectra
in Fig.
1. In microgravity,
a similar
analysis
was
performed
using
1.1s
of
data
taken
at
the
beginning
and
towards
the
end
of
the
drop
to
distinguish
initial
transients
from
steady
conditions
in microgravity.
The
results
in Fig.
2 show
that no flow
oscillations
were
detected
at the end of the drop,
thereby,
providing
direct
physical
evidence
that
the flow
oscillations
in the jet were
buoyancy
induced.
Figure
3 depicts
temporal
evolution
of the jet
flow
at various
axial
planes
using
data
from
a sequence
of schlieren
images
obtained
at 1000Hz.
Results
clearly
demonstrate
that buoyancy
plays
a key role on the near
field
flow
structure
of low density
jets.
In order
to investigate
the influence
of gravity
on the near-injector
development
of the flow,
a linear
temporal
stability
analysis
and a spatio-temporal
stability
analysis
of a low-density
round
jet
injected
into
a high-density
ambient
gas
were
performed.
The
flow
was
assumed
to be
isothermal
and
locally
parallel;
viscous
and
diffusive
effects
were
ignored.
The
variables
were
represented
as the
sum
of the mean
value
and
a normal-mode
small
disturbance.
An
ordinary
differential
equation
governing
the
amplitude
of
the pressure
disturbance
was
derived.
The
velocity
and density
profiles
in the shear
layer,
and the Froude
number
(signifying
the effects
of
gravity)
were
the
three
important
parameters
in
this
equation.
Together
with
the
boundary
conditions,
an
eigenvalue
problem
was
formulated.
The
eigenvalue
problem
was
solved
for
various
values
of
Froude
number;
the
temporal
growth
rates
and
the
phase
velocity
of
the
disturbances
were
obtained.
It was
found
that
the presence
of variable
density

the shear

layer
resulted
in
an
increase
in
the
temporal
amplification
rate
of
the
disturbances
and
an
increase
in the range
of unstable
frequencies,
accompanied
by a reduction
in the phase
velocities
of the
disturbances.
Also,
the
temporal
growth
rates
of the disturbances
were
increased
as the
Froude
number
was reduced
(i.e. gravitational
effects
increased),
indicating
the destabilizing
role
played
by gravity.
The spatio-temporal
stability
analysis
was
performed
to determine
the nature
of the
absolute
instability
of the jet.
The
roles
of the
density
ratio,
Froude
number,
Schmidt
number,
and the hteral shift between
the density
and velocity
profiles
on the absolute
instability
of the jet were
determined.
The
results
show
that
the combination
of these
variables
determines
how
absolutely
unstable
the jet will be.

ABSTRACT
An ultrasound
technique
has been
developed
to non-intrusively
image
temperature
fields
in
small-scale
systems
of
opaque
fluids
undergoing
convection.
Fluids
such
as
molten
metals,
semiconductors,
and polymers
are central
to many
industrial
processes,
and
are often
found
in
situations
where
natural
convection
occurs,
or where
thermal
gradients
are otherwise
important.
However,
typical
thermal
and velocimetric
diagnostic
techniques
rely
upon
transparency
of the
fluid
and container,
or require
the
addition
of seed particles,
or require
mounting
probes
inside
the fluid,
all of which
either
fail altogether
in opaque
fluids,
or necessitate
significant
invasion
of
the flow
and/or
modification
of the walls
of the container
to allow
access
to the fluid.
The idea
behind
our
work
is to
use
the
temperature
dependence
of
sound
velocity,
and
the
ease
of
propagation
of ultrasound
through
fluids
and
solids,
to probe
the thermal
fields
of convecting
opaque
fluids
non-intrusively
and without
the use of seed particles.
The
technique
involves
the
timing
of the return
echoes
from
ultrasound
pulses,
a variation
on an approach
used
previously
in
large-scale
systems.
1,2
We initially
validated
our method
by comparing
ultrasound
measurements
with
simultaneous
visualization
using
thermochromic
liquid
crystals
suspended
in
glycerol
in
a
transparent
convection
cell.
As
a next
step
we
assembled
a linear
array
of Panametrics
Mll0
ultrasound
transducers
and calibrated
it using
the experimentally
determined
temperature
variation
of sound
speed
in mercury.
We then
used
this
array
to measure
temperature
profiles
in a narrow
(2 cm)
and shallow
(1.3 cm) stainless
steel Rayleigh-B6nard
convection
cell filled
with mercury.
Figure
1 shows
typical
data.
In this
case
the array
of transducers
was
aligned
with
the long
dimension
of the chamber,
and located
at mid-height.
The
data output
yields
a temperature
profile
along
the
chamber,
perpendicular
to the
imposed
temperature
gradient.
The
profile
clearly
reveals
the
formation
of cells
driven
by natural
convection
as the temperature
difference
between
the bottom
and top
plates
was
slowly
increased
from
0 to
1.0 °C, the final
temperature
corresponding
to a
Rayleigh
number
(Ra) of 7550.
Figure
2 is a 2D image
of the thermal
field
in convecting
mercury
for
an imposed
vertical
temperature
difference
of 5.8
°C (Ra
= 43790).
This
image
was
obtained
by translating
one
Panametrics
V129,
under
computer
control,
from
location
to location
across
the outside
of the
chamber.
The
flow
consists
of
four
convection
rolls.
The
warmer,
rising
plumes
are
in the
middle
and at either
end, while
the cooler,
falling
plumes
are in between.

Mixing
driven
by buoyancy-induced
flows
is of particular
interest
to microgravity
processes,
as the body
force
that
governs
the intensity
of flow
fields
can be directly
controlled.
We consider
a model
experimental
system
to explore
the dynamics
of mixing
which
employs
two miscible
liquids
inside
a cavity
separated
initially
by a divider.
The two liquids
are oriented
vertically
inside
a rectangular
cavity
with constant
width
and
height,
and varying
depths
to approach
a cubical
configuration.
The two miscible
liquids
can be sufficiently
diluted
and died,
for example
water
and deuterium
oxide,
such
that a
distinct
interface
exists
across
the divider.
The transient
mixing
characteristic
of the two
fluids
is addressed
by following
the Lagrangian
history
of the interface
for various
aspect
ratios
in the z-plane
(depth
variation)
as well
as a range
of pulling
velocities
of the
divider.
The mixing
characteristic
of the two fluids
is quantified
from
measurement
of the
length
stretch
of the interface
using
image
processing
techniques.
Scaling
analysis
shows
that the length
stretch
depends
on four governing
parameters,
namely
the Grashof
number
(Gr),
Schmidt
number
(Sc),
aspect
ratio
(Ar),
and Reynolds
number
(Re).
We fix the
Grashofnumber
as well
as the Schmidt
number.
Thus our problem
reduces
to a co-
dimension
two bifurcation
in parametric
space
for Ar and Re.
Our experimental
results
show
that
for Gr on the order
of 106 and a nominal
cavity
aspect
ratio
Ar=0.2,
the net effect
of removal
of the divider
and the overwhelming
buoyancy
force
causes
an overturning
motion
which
stretches
and fold the interface
to
produce
an internal
breakwave.
The structure
of the breakwave
is similar
to the
ubiquitous
Rayleigh-Taylor
instability
morphology.
The breakwave
is dissipated
either
through
internal
or wall
collision
depending
on the impulsive
velocity
of the divider
as
prescribed
by the Reynolds
number.
The decay
of the collision
event
occurs
through
sloshing
oscillations
over a short
time scale.
The two
fluids
then become
stably
stratified
with
a diffusive
band
at the interface
indicating
mass
transport.
The local
bifurcation
of the internal
breakwave
is investigated
as a function
of
aspect
ratio.
Results
show
that
for narrow
cavities
on the order
of 2mm
(Ar=0.04),
folding
does
not occur
the interface
only stretches.
As the cavity
size increases
folding
occurs
through
a supercritical
bifurcation.
Insight
into the mechanism
of folding
is
obtained
from
measurement
of the flow
field
using
Particle
Imaging
Velocimetry.
These
results
show
that in the neighborhood
of the folding
event,
there
exists
hyperbolic
points
in the flow
caused
by multiple
vortex
interactions.
The global
stretch
of the interface
as a
function
of time is nearly
Gaussian;
calculations
of finite-time
Lyapunov
exponents
as
well
as construction
of horseshoe
maps
indicate
the likelihood
of a chaotic
transient.

ABSTRACT
The
use
of near-critical
fluids
allows
important
parameters
(e.g.,
compressibility
of
supercritical
fluids,
density
of gas and
liquid
phases,
surface
tension)
to be
easily
varied
by
using
small
changes
in temperature.
These
highly
variable
properties
of near-critical
fluids
makes
it possible
to study
interesting
phenomena
when
external
forces
are applied
to the fluid.
In particular,
I plan
to study
geophysical
flows
in a spherical
capacitor.
The spherical
capacitor
will
exert
a central
polar
(di-electrophoretic)
force
on
a supercritical
fluid.
This
creates
a
central
body
force
on the
hyper-compressible
fluid
with
a resultant
radial
density
gradient.
Large-scale
geophysical
flows,
analogous
to a planetary
liquid
core,
a planetary
ocean
or
atmosphere,
etc., could
be
studied
when
a Coriolis
force
is also
applied
in a rotating
frame
of
reference.
In this presentation,
I will show
experimental
results
in support
of this goal.
In
spherical
geometry,
such
as
concentric
spheres
with
dielectric
fluid
between
them
(a spherical
capacitor),
an
electric
field
gradient
produces
a central
body
force
that
is
similar
to the gravitational
field
of a planet.
By using
an AC electric
field
this force
is retained
and the extraneous
effects
of free charges
are eliminated.
Variations
in the dielectric
constant
produce
a buoyancy
force
in the presence
of this polarization
force,
just
as variations
in mass
density
produce
a buoyancy
force
in
the
presence
of
gravity.
We
have
found,
with
a
sufficiently
small
capacitor,
that this dielectric
buoyancy
is effective
to produce
instability
near
the center
electrode
in incompressible
fluids,
on Earth.
I will present
results
of our experiments
in this
small
spherical
capacitor
that
systematically
studies
this
instability
when
the
center
sphere
is heated.
Specifically,
we have
found
upward
traveling
toroidal
or spiral
rolls that
form
along
the inner
sphere
when
AT (the temperature
difference
between
the spheres)
and AV (the
voltage
difference
between
the spheres)
are sufficiently
high.
These
rolls
start
near
the center
sphere's
equator
and travel
vertically
upward.
The
onset
of this instability
depends
on both
AT
and AV, and these
two
quantities
appear
to be related,
within
the parameter
range
accessible
to
our experimental
system,
by a power
law.
Measurements
of the heat
transfer
show
that
these
traveling
rolls
also significantly
increase
the heat
transfer
at onset.
In a compressible
dielectric
(near-critical)
fluid,
the central
polarization
force present
in
a spherical
capacitor
will lead to a density
gradient
in a manner
similar
to a compressible
fluid
in
a gravitational
field.
I have
performed
experiments
on parabolic
flights
using
NASA's
KC 135A
aircraft
in a spherical
capacitor
filled
with
near-critical
fluid.
Our attempts
to induce
a
spherical
density
gradient
showed
that the 20 seconds
of low
gravity
was insufficient
time.
The
horizontal
density
gradient
from
normal
gravity
never
disappears.
We
did
see,
however,
appreciable
density
changes
in the capacitor
in a fluid
near the critical
point
when
the field was
applied.
Our current
effort
is directed
at placing
this system
in a rotating
frame
of reference
in
preparation
for a space
experiment
including:
shadowgraph
visualization
optics
appropriate
for
NASA/T_2002-211211

a rotating
frame,
precision
temperature
control
using
thermoelectric
heat
pumps,
control
and
data acquisition
in a rotating
frame.
Because
near-critical
fluids
are
full
of
novelty
when
they
are
driven
far-from-
equilibrium,
it is important
to understand
near-critical
fluid
convection
so that
we can
have
a
reasonable
understanding
of how
such
a fluid
will respond
in the rotating
spherical
capacitor
(RoSCA).
To this
end we are studying
a compressible
near-critical
fluid in a Rayleigh-B6nard
cell
(flat
fluid
layer
heated
from
below).
One
such
novelty
that
we
have
discovered
is a
Rayleigh-Taylor
instability,
when
the top
plate
is held
below
the
critical
temperature
in the
two-phase
regime.
A hexagonal
droplet
pattern
forms
on the wetted
top plate
when
the bottom
is heated.
Because
the liquid-gas
density
difference
and
surface
tension
become
zero
as the
critical
temperature
is
approached,
this
is
an
ideal
system
to
see
the
effect
of
thermal
fluctuations
on
pattern
formation.
By
controlling
the
ambient
temperature,
the
size
and
periodicity
of the droplet
pattern
is also
controlled.
As the surface
tension
gets very
small
near
the critical
point
the droplets
also
become
very
small
and randomly
positioned
(as opposed
to
the hexagonal
pattern).
The thin
wetting
layer
is stabilized
by the Van
der
Waal's
force
from
top
sapphire
plate
and
the
small
liquid-gas
density
difference.
On
approaching
the
critical
temperature,
these
droplets
decrease
in size
as the density
fluctuations
increase
in size.
Near
the critical
point,
when
the forming
droplets
and the density
fluctuations
are of the same
order
of size,
we have
observed
droplets
forming
in the presence
of thermal
fluctuations.
It appears
that
the droplets
begin
to form
a pattern
that
is highly
perturbed
by fluctuations.
Another
novel
effect
in near
critical
fluids,
that
is important
for
the
RoSCA,
is the
effect
of
an
electric
field
on
the
critical
temperature.
Different
theories
predict
upward
or
downward
shifts
in the critical
temperature
when
an electric
field
is applied.
Some
experiments
have
reported
a downward
shift
in the critical
temperature
for polymers
and binary
mixtures.
These
previous
experiments
have
also
been
criticized
for not
controlling
heating
effects
and
ignoring
pressure/density
from
an external
mass
reservoir.
We have
performed
an experiment
that
has
avoided
these
difficulties
and
I believe
resolved
this
controversy.
Using
a spherical
capacitor
of similar
dimensions
of the RoSCA
with
near
critical
fluid
between
the inner
and
outer
sphere,
we
have
applied
an AC
field
that
avoids
joule
heating.
These
experiments
are
performed
in a ground-based
environment
so that
a gravitationally
induced
density
gradient
assures
a small
layer
of
critical
fluid
somewhere
in the
capacitor
that
the
light
must
pass
through.
In this cell I have
found
an upward
shift
in the critical
temperature
that
depends
on the
electric
field,
as predicted
separately
by
Landau
and
Onuki.
This
shift
is repeatable
and
is
found
by measuring
the average
turbidity
through
the vertical
density
gradient
(monochromatic
beam
axis
is vertical)
while
slowly
ramping
the
temperature
downward
through
the
critical
temperature.
By
measuring
the
light
intensity
of
a beam
that
travels
through
the
fluid
and
varying
the
ramping
rate
and
voltage,
we
found
a repeatable
upward
shift
of
the
critical
temperature
as a function
of the applied
electric
field.

INTRODUCTION
AND
MOTIVATION
Sonoluminescence
is the
term
used
to
describe
the
emission
of
light
from
a violently
collapsing
bubble.
Sonoluminescence
("light
from
sound")
is the
result
of extremely
nonlinear
pulsations
of gas/vapor
bubbles
in liquids
when
subject
to sufficiently
high
amplitude
acoustic
pressures.
In a single
collapse,
a bubble's
volume
can be compressed
more
than
a thousand-fold
in the span
of less
than
a microsecond.
Even
the simplest
consideration
of the thermodynamics
yields
pressures
on the order
of 10,000
ATM.
and temperatures
of at least
10,000K.
On the face
of things,
it is not
surprising
that
light
should
be emitted
from
such
an extreme
process.
Since
1990
(the year
that
Gaitan
discovered
light
from
a single
bubble)
there
has been
a tremendous
amount
of
experimental
and
theoretical
research
in
stable,
single-bubble
sonoluminescence
(SBSL),
yet there
remain
at least
four unexplained
phenomena
associated
with
SBSL
in lg:
•
the light
emission
mechanism
itself
•
the existence
ofanisotropies
in the emitted
light,
•
the disappearance
of the bubble
at some
critical
acoustic
pressure,
and
•
the appearance
ofquasiperiodic
and
chaotic
oscillations
in theflash
timing.
Gravity,
in the context
of the buoyant
force,
is implicated
in all four of these.
We
are
developing
KC-135
experiments
probing
the
effect
of
gravity
on
single
bubble
sonoluminescence.
By
determining
the stability
boundaries
experimentally
in microgravity,
and
measuring
not
only
light
emission
but
mechanical
bubble
response,
we will
be able
to directly
test
the predictions
of
existing
theories.
By
exploiting
the
microgravity
environment
we
will
gain
new knowledge
impossible
to obtain
in earth-based
labs
that will enable
explanations
for the
above
problems.
We
will
also
be in a position
to make
new
discoveries
about
light-emitting
bubbles.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives
of the investigation
are:
(1)
To develop
an experimental
apparatus
to fly on the KC-135
that will monitor
cabin
pressure,
water
temperature,
bubble
position
and
size,
acceleration,
emitted
light
intensity,
and
acoustic
pressure.
(2)
To
model
the
hydrodynamic
effects
of
acceleration
on
bubble
dynamics
and
SBSL
in
realistic
acoustic
resonators.
The primary
Bjerknes
force,
buoyancy,
ambient
pressure,
drag,
mass
diffusion,
shape
stability
and (empirically)
light
emission
will
be accounted
for in the
model.
(3)
To
measure
(as
a function
of
acceleration
during
parabolic
flight)
a bubble's
position,
equilibrium
radius,
maximum
radius,
oscillatory
radius,
and
spatially
and
temporally
resolved
light
emission.
This
will be
done
for
a range
of dissolved
gas
concentrations
in
order
to compare
with predictions
of our hydrodynamic
model.
(4)
To
measure
(as
a function
of
acceleration
during
parabolic
flight)
the
precise
values
of
acoustic
pressure
and
equilibrium
radius
that
leads
to
the
extinction
of
a light-emitting
bubble,
a phenomenon
which
occurs
at
a well
defined
critical
acoustic
pressure
in
lg
experiments.
This
will test theories
that
postulate
either
a nonlinear
levitation
instability,
or
a Rayleigh-Taylor
instability
mechanism
for the bubble
disappearance.

RESULTS
We have
completed
3 KC-135
flight
campaigns.
We
attempted
to test the prediction
of our model
[1]
that hydrodynamics
alone
dictate
a 5 - 35 % change
in
SBSL
intensity,
(depending
approximately
linearly
on the dissolved
gas concentration)
for
the
10-4g
to
1.8g
swing
typical
of
a K-135
parabolic
maneuver.
The driving
mechanism
for this effect
is
the
small
change
in head
pressure
experienced
by
the bubble
when
the acceleration
changes.
Figure
1
shows
the
measured
bubble
dynamics
during
a
single
parabola.
The
main
result
[2]
is
that
for
nearly
0g, the bubble
grows
and
emits
more
light,
while
at 2g the bubble
shrinks
and
emits
less
light.
The
results
are in rough
agreement
with
our model.
We
have
completely
overhauled
the
data
acquisition
system
to make
better
use
of
available
computer
resources.
We
have
installed
a joystick-

SBSL

experience
a
time-varying

(quantified
by the oscillatory

ratio
Vmax/V0,
see
Fig.
2)
which
reaches
maximal
3600
excursions
precisely
where
sonoluminescence
is
observed.
This
results
in
a
strong
nonlinear
2400
coupling
between
volume
and
translatory
motions,
v.y._
Removing
the
acceleration
of
gravity
from
the
v0
system
will
eliminate
buoyancy-driven
translatory
1200
oscillations
of the bubble.
This
would
be a decisive
test
of
light
emission
mechanisms,
and
will
also
shed
light
on the
chemical
reaction
theory
of mass
0
flux
for volume
stability
as well
as the
resonance-
controlled
shape
oscillation
instability.
Thus,
a
microgravity
environment
will
change
the
geography
of the parameter
space,
and the only hope
for
a clear
understanding
of the

THEORY
OF
MACRO-
AND
MICRO-
ENCAPSULATION
Macro-capsules
are defined
to be the capsules
whose
radii
are larger
than
100 _ m. Micro
capsules
have
radii
between
100
_ m and 10 _ m. Continuum
theory
is valid
for the
investigation
of macro-capsule
and micro-capsules
formation
is expected
to be valid
up to the
lower
range
of micro-encapsulation.
Consider
the flow
in an annular
liquid
jet of a constant
thickness
h, a constant
inner
radius
Ri, and a constant
outer
radius
R0. The jet with density
p
and viscosity
_
emanates
from
an
annular
nozzle
which
is coaxial
with a circular
cylinder
of radius
Rw. The fluid
inside
the annular
jet has density
Pi and
_i.
The jet is surrounded
by another
fluid
of density
P0 and viscosity/,to.
All three
fluids
are Newtonian.
The governing
equations
are the Navier-Stokes
equations.
The
corresponding
boundary
conditions
are the dynamic
and kinematic
boundary
conditions
at each
fluid-fluid
interface.
And the no-slip
conditions
at the pipe
wall.
An exact
solution
for a steady
basic
flow which
satisfies
the governing
differential
system
has been
obtained
[15].
The relevant
2
flow parameters
are: Weber
number
of the inner
interface
We_ = p_U
h/S_,
Weber
number
of
the inner
interface
We o = poU2h/So
, Reynolds
number
pU2h/l
a , Froude
number
Fr = U2/gh,
viscosity
ratios
N_ = _i/_,
N o = _0/_,
density
ratios
Q_ = p_/p,
Qo = Po/P,
and radius
ratios
r_ = R_/h,
ro = R o/h,
where
Si and So are respectively
the surface
tension
of the inner
and
the outer
interface
and
Uis
the liquid
jet velocity
at R = (R_ + R 0)/2,
R being
the radial
distance
measured
from
the axis of the annular.
The curve
for Fr -1 = 0 in this figure
corresponds
to 0-g
condition.
The other
curves
correspond
to the case of finite
gravity.
The onset
of instability
of this basic
flow
with respect
to temporal
and spatial-temporal
disturbances
has been
analyzed
by use of a spectra
collocation
method.
Extension
of the well
tested
analytical
and numerical
method
to the present
problems
is straightforward,
but results
in a
relatively
larger
system
for numerical
computation
which
required
a high precision.
Extraction
of
information
from
the numerical
results
also becomes
more
laborious
because
of the larger
number
of flow
parameters
involved.
The results
we have
obtained
show
that
[1] there
are two
independent
interracial
modes
of convective
instability.
Two
independent
modes
of instability
were
also
found
in the earlier
work
for a two dimensional
plan
liquid
sheet
as well
as an annular
jet in an invisid
gas, i.e., sinuous
and varicose
modes
[16, 17, 18]. Two
interfaces
move
in phase
in the sinuous
mode
but they move
180 ° out of phase
in the varicose
mode.
However
unlike
the
plan
sheet,
there
is no surface
of symmetry
within
the annulus,
and consequently
a completely
in-
phase
or out-of-phase
interracial
motion
does
not exit. Nevertheless
the two independent
modes
of the interracial
motion
are actually
almost
in phase
or out of phase.
They
are call here
para-
sinuous
and para-varicose
modes.
The emergence
of either
one of these
modes
or both
of them
NASA/T_2002-211211

depends
on the initial
condition
at the nozzle
exit.
This fact has an important
practical
implication
in encapsulation
applications.
The onset
ofpara-varicose
mode
needs
to be
suppressed,
since
it leads
to breakup
at the thinnest
of the annulus
and leaves
part of the core
material
unencapsulated
as depicted
in Fig.
1. On the other
hand
the onset
ofpara-sinuous
mode
should
be promoted,
since
it leads
to a uniform
shell
thickness
as is also depicted
in the same
figure.
This fact has not been
made
aware
of in the know
literature.
Fig.
1 also shows
the spatial
exponential
amplification
rate
ki as functions
of the wave
length
;L = 27vhh/k,,
k, being
the wave
number,
for two values
of Fr and the rest of parameters
specified
in the caption.
Note
that the
amplification
curves
for the two modes
for the case
of finite
g corresponding
to Fr -1 = 10000
intersect
at point
e. Below
the wave
number
corresponding
to point
e the para-sinuous
mode
dominates.
Above
this wave
number
the para-varicose
mode
dominates.
Hence
if one attempts
to
produce
macro
capsules
by introducing
an external
forcing
with
frequency
corresponding
to k, for
which
the sinuous
mode
is unstable
one will not be able to completely
encapsulate
the core
material,
because
the para-varicose
mode
is also present.
The same
figure
also shows
that when
the finite
gravity
is reduced
to zero,
the amplification
curves
(solid
line)
for the two modes
cease
to intersect
and the para-varicose
mode
is absent
between
the two cutoff
wave
numberfand
f'.
The para-sinuous
and para-varicose
modes
are stable
respectively
if the wave
numbers
are larger
than
that at pointfand
f'
in Fig.
1. Thus in the wave
number
range
betweenfand
f',
one may
impart
a monocramatic
external
forcing
of a frequency
corresponding
to the selected
wave
number,
and excite
a sinuous
wave
to initiate
production
of a capsule
of desired
radius.

Abstract
Thermocapillary
migration
is a method
for moving
bubbles
in space
in the absence
of
buoyancy.
A temperature
gradient
is applied
to the
continuous
phase
in which
a bubble
is
situated,
and the applied
gradient
impressed
on the bubble
surface
causes
one pole
of the drop to
be cooler
than
the opposite
pole. As the surface
tension
is a decreasing
function
of temperature,
the cooler
pole pulls
at the warmer
pole,
creating
a flow which
propels
the bubble
in the direction
of the warmer
fluid.
A major
impediment
to the practical
use of thermocapillarity
to direct
the
movement
of bubbles
in
space
is the
fact
that
surfactant
impurities
which
are
unavoidably
present
in the
continuous
phase
can
significantly
reduce
the migration
velocity.
A surfactant
impurity
adsorbed
onto the bubble
interface
is swept to the trailing
end of the bubble.
When
bulk
concentrations
are low (which
is the case with an impurity),
diffusion
of surfactant
to the front
end
is slow
relative
to convection,
and
surfactant
collects
at the
back
end
of the
bubble.
Collection
at the back
lowers
the surface
tension
relative
to the front
end setting
up a reverse
tension
gradient.
(This can also be the case if kinetic
desorption
of surfactant
at the back end of
the bubble
is much
slower
than convection.)
For buoyancy
driven
bubble
motions
in the absence
of a thermocapillarity,
the tension
gradient
opposes
the surface
flow,
and reduces
the surface
and
terminal
velocities
(the
interface
becomes
more
solid-like
and
bubbles
translate
as
solid
particles).
When
thermocapillary
forces
are present,
the reverse
tension
gradient
set up by the
surfactant
accumulation
reduces
the temperature
induced
tension
gradient,
and can decrease
to
near zero the
bubble's
thermocapillary
velocity.
The objective
of our research
is to develop
a method
for enhancing
the thermocapillary
migration
of bubbles
which
have
been retarded
by the adsorption
onto the bubble
surface
of a
surfactant
impurity.
Our
remobilization
theory
proposes
to
use
surfactant
molecules
which
kinetically
rapidly
exchange
between
the
bulk
and
the
surface
and
are
at
high
bulk
concentrations.
Because
the
remobilizing
surfactant
is present
at much
higher
concentrations
than
the impurity,
it adsorbs
to the bubble
surface
much
faster than the impurity
when
the bubble
is formed,
and thereby
prevents
the impurity
from
adsorbing
onto the surface.
In addition
the
rapid kinetic
exchange
and high bulk concentration
maintain
a saturated
surface
with a uniform
surface
concentrations.
This
prevents
retarding
surface
tension
gradients
and
keeps
the
thermocapillary
velocity
high.

In this report,
we detail
experimental
observations
of remobilization
for the buoyancy
driven
motion
of air bubbles
in a glycerol/water
mixture..
Two polyethylene
oxide
surfactants
were studied,
C12E6
(CH3(CH2)ll(OCH2CH2)6OH)
and C]oE8 (CH3(CH2)9(OCH2CH2)8OH).
Measurements
of the kinetic
exchange
for these
surfactants
show that the one with the longer
hydrophobe
chain
C]2E6 has a lower
rate of kinetic
exchange.
In addition,
this surfactant
is much
less soluble
in the glycerol/water
mixture
because
of the shorter
ethoxylate
chain.
As a result,
we
found that
C12E6
had no ability
to remobilize
rising bubbles
because
of the limited
kinetic
exchange
and reduced
solubility
(Fig. 1). However,
C]0Es, with its
higher
solubility
and more
rapid exchange
was found to dramatically
remobilize
rising bubbles
(Fig. 2).

We
also
report
results
on describing
theoretically
the remobilization
observed
in our
ground
based
buoyancy
driven
experiments.
We
construct
a model
in which
a bubble
rises
steadily
by buoyancy
in a continuous
(Newtonian)
viscous
fluid
containing
surfactant
with
a
uniform
far field bulk
concentration.
We account
for the effects
of inertia
as well as viscosity
in
the flow in the continuous
phase
caused
by the bubble
motion
(order
one Reynolds
number),
and
we
assume
that
the bubble
shape
remains
spherical
(viscous
and
inertial
pressure
forces
are
smaller
than
capillary
forces,
i.e. small
Weber
and capillary
numbers).
The surfactant
tension
gradients
which
retard
the surface
velocity
are incorporated
by equating
the viscous
shear stress
at
the
bubble
surface
to
the
surface
tension
gradient
created
by
the
surfactant
surface
concentration
distribution.
This distribution
is calculated
by solving
the mass transfer
equations
including
convection
and diffusion
in the bulk,
and finite kinetic
exchange
between
the bulk and
the surface.
Convective
effects
dominate
diffusive
mass
transfer
in the bulk of the liquid
(high
Peclet
numbers)
except
in a thin boundary
layer near the surface.
A finite volume
method
is used
to numerically
solve the hydrodynamic
and mass transfer
equations
on a staggered
grid
which
accounts
specifically
for the thin boundary
layer.
We present
the results
of the nondimensional
drag as a function
of the bulk concentration
of surfactant
for different
rates of kinetic
exchange,
and we compare
our theoretical
calculations
to the experimental
measurements
of velocity
for
both the non-remobilizing
and remobilizing
surfactants,
and found
excellent
agreement.

ABSTRACT
A
combined
computational
and
experimental
study
is conducted
of
the
development
of
rivulets
from
a liquid
sheet
driven
by
wind
shear
in
different
gravitational
states.
The
study
concentrates
on the effect
of the normal
component
of gravity
on rivulet
formation
and evolution.
Understanding
of rivulet
development
in the presence
of wind
shear
is important
for a number
of
coating
processes,
for
modeling
development
of
ice
rivulets
on
aircraft
wings
and
of
water
motion
on vehicle
windshields,
and
for modeling
the breakup
of annular
flow
in a tube
into
a
rivulet
flow regime.
The current
study
is at the midway
point
of a four-year
project.
The experimental
part of the project
has focused
on the dynamics
of gravity-
and wind-driven
rivulets.
The experimental
setup
comprises
a small
"rivulet
windtunnel",
which
consists
of a flat
plate
into which
a liquid
is injected
at an upstream
location,
and through
which
air flow passes.
The
entire
setup
is mounted
on a mobile
cart
that can
be tilted
to angles
varying
from
0° to 90 °.
Preliminary
experiments
revealed
significant
differences
in rivulet
dynamics
for
gravity-driven
and
shear-driven
cases.
Gravity-driven
rivulets
initially
formed
as a lobe
extending
from
the
liquid
source,
which
flowed
for
a
short
distance
straight
down
the
base
surface
and
then
eventually
adopted
a meandering
form.
Shear-driven
rivulets
start
out
in a similar
manner
to
gravity-driven
rivulets,
but instead
of extending
as a long
liquid
finger
the shear-driven
rivulets
exhibit
an interesting
phenomenon
that we refer to as "blobbing".
Blobbing
(illustrated
in Fig.
1)
is a cyclical
process
whereby
the rivulet
progresses
by
formation
of blobs,
which
enlarge
and
oscillate
in the air flow.
After
some
time
a lobe
in the blob's
downstream
side
develops
and the
liquid
extends
downstream,
thus
draining
the blob.
The process
then
repeats
at a downstream
location.

The computational
part of the project
uses lubrication
theory
with
a precurser
film to remove
the
contact
line
singularity
and
constant
surface
shear
stress.
The
effect
of
contact
angle
is
modeled
using
a disjoining
pressure
approach.
Two-dimensional
equilibrium
solutions
for
a
shear-driven
liquid
film front
are obtained
which
show
that the ridge
of liquid just
downstream
of
the
front
has
layer
thickness
which
decreases
with
increase
in
the normal
body
force
to the
substrate.
A linear
stability
analysis
of the equilibrium
liquid
front
indicates
that
the decrease
in
thickness
of the
front
ridge
leads
to suppression
of the fingering
instability,
and with
sufficient
normal
body
force
may
even
eliminate
the fingering
instability.
These
results
confirm
and extend
the
analysis
of
Bertozzi
and
Brenner
(Phys.
Fluids'
9(3),
530-539,
1997)
for
flow
down
an
inclined
plate
at different
inclination
angles.
Nonlinear
computations
are performed
using
an ADI
method
which
confirm
the results
cited
above.
The
nonlinear
computations
(shown
in Fig.
2)
indicate
that
rivulet
develop
in the presence
of normal
body
force
proceeds
in much
the
same
manner
as
without
body
force,
only
more
slowly.
We
are
currently
using
the
numerical
computation
method
to investigate
the
effect
of surface
contamination
on rivulet
formation.
In
these
computations,
surface
contamination
is modeled
by driving
the liquid
front
over an array
of
either
droplets
or
spots
of
different
contact
angle.
This
part
of
the
study
is examining
the
amplification
that
occurs
as a small
upstream
perturbation
passes
through
the liquid
front,
and the
effect
of this amplification
on rivulet
development
for different
normal
gravity
states.
Our future
computational
work
will
couple
a laminar
wind
flow
calculation
to the liquid
film calculation
in
order
to
account
for
variable
shear
and
pressure
on
the
liquid
surface.
The
wind
flow
computation
will
employ
a finite-volume
approach
with
moveable
mesh,
where
the
bottom
boundary
condition
is set by the liquid
layer
thickness
and velocity.

ABSTRACT
We plan
a rigorous
test of the theory
of dynamic
scaling
by accurately
measuring
the bulk vis-
cosity
of xenon
in microgravity
50 times
closer
to the critical
temperature
Tc than previous
experi-
ments.
The bulk
viscosity
_ (or "second
viscosity"
or "dilational
viscosity")
will be determined
by
measuring
the attenuation
length
of sound
a_ and also measuring
the frequency-dependence
of the
speed
of
sound.
For
these
measurements,
we
developed
a unique
Helmholtz
resonator
and
specialized
electro-acoustic
transducers.
We
describe
the
resonator,
the
transducers,
their
performance
on Earth,
and their
expected
performance
in microgravity.
Any
fluid
very
near
its liquid-vapor
critical
point
contains
highly-correlated
density
fluctua-
tions
characterized
by
a long
relaxation
time
_. When
cot > 1 [where
co= 2tel(period
of
sound
wave)]
the
attenuation
of the
sound
greatly
exceeds
the
attenuation
calculated
from
the
shear
viscosity
and thermal
conductivity.
The
excess
sound
attenuation
is associated
with
dilatational
motion
of the fluid and is accounted
for by the bulk viscosity.
The excess
attenuation
encountered
in monatomic,
near-critical,
xenon
somewhat
resembles
the
excess
attenuation
encountered
in
polyatomic
molecules
that
have
a long
relaxation
time
characterizing
energy
exchange
between
translational
and internal
degrees
of freedom
According
to the theory
of dynamical
scaling,
both
the attenuation
length
a_ and the sound-
speed
dispersion
become
universal
functions
of
cot as the
reduced
temperature
t _
0.
[Here
t D (TDTc)/T_.] The best
prior
tests
of the theory
were
conducted
in near-critical
xenon
and helium
[1,2]
at frequencies
of
0.5 MHz
and
higher.
These
tests
encountered
the
condition
cot = 1 at
t D 10-3. The
experimenters
introduced
empirical
parameters
to describe
how
their
a_(cor)
data
might
cross
over
from
the experimentally
accessible
region
to the expected
asymptotic
region
at
smaller
values
of t. Even
with
such
parameters,
the data
disagreed
with
theory,
within
combined
uncertainties.
Because
we are using
lower
frequencies
(130
Hz to 1300
Hz)
and because
we will
use microgravity
to evade
the stratification
of near-critical
xenon
in the Earth's
gravity,
we expect
to encounter
cot < 1 at t [] 2 x 10-5, 50 times
closer
to To.
For
these
measurements,
we designed
the acoustic
resonator
shown
in Figs.
la
and
lb.
It is
composed
of two
chambers
connected
by a small
tube.
The chambers
are cylindrical
with perpen-
dicular
axes.
The chambers
have
nearly
equal
volumes
(-10
cm3), but very
different
aspect
ratios.
One
is 48 mm
long
with
a
16 mm
ID;
the
other
is 22.2
mm
long
with
a 23.5
mm
ID.
The
connecting
tube
is 15 mm long
with
a 4 mm
ID.
This
resonator
has two
low-frequency
acoustic
modes
that are well
separated
from
each
other
and all other
modes.
The lowest-frequency
mode
is
a Helmholtz
mode
in which
the gas oscillates
between
the chambers
through
the small
tube.
In the
next
mode,
the
gas
oscillates
along
the length
of the
longer
chamber.
For
these
two
modes
in
microgravity,
Figure
2 shows
the expected
contributions
to the acoustic
losses

viscosity,
the
shear
viscosity,
and
the
thermal
conductivity.
On
Earth,
the
stratification
of the
xenon's
density
from
the top
to the bottom
of the resonator
will prevent
accurate
measurements
of the bulk viscosity
closer
than
150mK
to the critical
point
(t < 5 x 10-4).

Two
types
of transducers
have been
developed
to both
excite
and detect
sound.
The first type
uses
piezo-ceramic
disks
epoxied
to the outside
of a 2.5mm
thick
diaphragm
at each
end of the
chambers.
Flexure
of the
diaphragms
couples
to the
radial
displacement
of the
ceramics
and,
therefore,
to the voltages
that
are applied
or detected
at the
electrodes.
The
advantages
of this
technique
are (1) electrical
feedthroughs
are not necessary,
(2) no foreign
materials
come
in con-
tact with the xenon,
and (3) coupling
to the xenon
is independent
of temperature.

The
second
type
of
transducer
is
immersed
in
the
xenon.
It
consists
of
closely-spaced
(< 10 _m),
interdigitated
electrodes
deposited
on
a quartz
substrate.
(The
electrodes
are
the
lighter
areas
in Fig. 3.) For detecting
sound,
the electrodes
are biased
with
a DC voltage.
An im-
pinging
acoustic
wave
changes
the density
of the xenon
near
the electrodes.
The resulting
change
in capacitance
generates
an AC
signal.
To generate
sound,
an AC voltage
V at frequency
f is ap-
plied
to the
interdigitated
electrodes.
The
resulting
electric
field
creates
a pressure
(proportional
to V2) that pulls
the xenon
towards
the electrodes
at frequency
2f
This phenomenon
is called
elec-

ABSTRACT
The
effects
of buoyancy
on
the
flow
regimes,
the
bubble
characteristics,
and
the
bubble
detachment
mechanisms
of submerged
gas
injection
from
a free-standing
capillary
tube
were
studied.
The effects
of liquid
coflow,
reduced
surface
tension,
and increased
viscosity
were
also
analyzed.
The
microgravity
experiments
were
carried
out in the 2.2
Second
Drop
Tower
at the
NASA
Glenn
Research
Center.
The
two-phase
flow
rig
(97cm
x 41cm
x 84 cm)
was
totally
autonomous
from
the
instant
of release
in
the
drop
tower;
photographs
of
the
bubbles
were
captured
by a high-speed
camera
and
stored
on the onboard
computer.
A Lexan
rectangular
test
section
with
the
dimensions:
5cm
x
5cm
and
41cm
in height
was
used.
The
injection
was
vertically
upwards
from
a free-standing
tube
of 0.51mm
in diameter
and
150mm
in length.
The
dimensions
of the test section
ensured
that
the confinement
effects
on the bubble
formation
were
minimized
for low
gas flow rates.
The
liquid
velocity
could
be
varied
from
2 cm/s
to 4 cm/s
by means
of a compressed
air
system.
For all gas and liquid
throughputs
tested,
a pre-flowing
procedure
of the two phases
was
followed
for
an interval
of ten
seconds
before
every
drop
to bring
the
system
to steady
state
conditions.
To reduce
the surface
tension,
a non-ionic
surfactant
(ChemSurf
90) was added
to the
deionized
water.
For the increased
liquid
viscosity
experiments,
a mixture
of deionized
water
and
glycerin
was
used.
Video
images
were
recorded
with
a high-speed
camera
(Kodak
EktaPro
RO
Imager)
at a rate
of 500
frames/second
using
backlighting
against
a reflective
white
surface.
The
camera
began
to record
200ms
after
the drop
was
initiated
to avoid
the transient
environment
from
normal
gravity
to microgravity
conditions.
All
images
were
analyzed
with
a computer
image-processing
unit.
For the experiments
of gas injection
into a quiescent
liquid,
bubble
detachment
was observed
for
all the
Weber
numbers
tested
(0.28
to 31.12).
Also,
the bubbles
were
effectively
displaced
from
the near-injector
region.
Experiments
with
liquid
coflow
(2 cm/s
and 4 cm/s),
and low
gas
flow
rates
indicated
faster
and more
controllable
bubble
detachment
than
those
injected
into
a
quiescent
liquid.
For high
gas flow
rates
(We > 10) with
the liquid
coflow,
the bubble
sizes
were
more
uniform
when
compared
to
injection
in
a quiescent
liquid.
Similarly,
reduced
surface
tension
(4.2mN/m)
decreased
detachment
times,
resulting
in smaller
and more
uniform
bubbles.
For the range
of Weber
numbers
tested
with the addition
of surfactant
(0.75
to 81.06),
bubble
detachment
as well
as effective
bubble
displacements
was observed
for all the conditions
tested.
An increase
in liquid
viscosity
slowed
down
the detachment
process,
resulting
in larger
bubbles.
Bubble
detachment
was
observed
for the Weber
numbers
ranging
from
0.74
to 37.12.
However,
NASA/T_2002-211211
233

the bubbles
were
never
effectively
displaced
from
the near
injector
area
for Weber
numbers
< 4.
Bubble
formation
under
quiescent
liquid
conditions
in microgravity
is illustrated
in Figure
1.
The present
experimental
results
highlight
the
differences
observed
between
bubbles
formed
in
gas injection
from
free-standing
tubes
and those
formed
when
the
gas is injected
from
a plate-
orifice.

ABSTRACT
Standing
surface
waves
form
on a layer
of fluid
when
it is subjected
to a sufficiently
strong
periodic
acceleration
in the vertical
direction.
There
have
been
numerous
theoret-
ical and
experimental
investigations
of pattern
formation
in this
so-called
Faraday
wave
system
in the
last
15 years
or so, in part
because
it exhibits
patterns
not
seen
in other
systems
(rhombic
and
triangular
patterns,
quasipatterns,
superlattice
patterns,
localized
structures
akin
to oscillons,
etc.).
Hence
it provides
a versatile
framework
in which
to
develop
and
test
our
general
understanding
of the nonlinear
pattern
formation
process
in
hydrodynamic
systems.
However,
this
versatility
comes
at some
cost.
Specifically,
many
of the
more
exotic
patterns
are only
realized
when
the
periodic
forcing
function
contains
more
than
one frequency
component;
the
introduction
of nonsinusoidal
periodic
forcing
functions
leads
to a large
control
parameter
space
that
is difficult
to fully
characterize.
For
example,
there
is an
increase
from
2 parameters
(frequency
and
amplitude)
to
5
parameters
in the
next
simplest
case
of two-frequency
forcing
(frequencies,
amplitudes
and
relative
phase).
We
report
on
research
that
helps
explain
the
role
of
each
of
the
forcing
function
parameters
in the pattern
formation
process.
We focus
on resonant
triad
interactions
and
their
contribution
to
the
weakly
nonlinear
pattern
formation
process
for
two-frequency
forced
parametrically
excited
surface
waves.
Our
analysis
highlights
the effects
of weakly
broken
time
translation
and
time
reversal
symmetries
that
result
in the weak
forcing
and
damping
case.
We
determine
scaling
laws
for
the
resonant
triad
interactions
with
the
forcing
frequency
ratio.
We also
find
that
the relative
phase
of the
two
forcing
terms
can
have
a dramatic
effect
on the
nonlinear
interactions.
We confirm
our
predicted
scaling
by numerically
calculating
coefficients
for the
resonant
triad
amplitude
equations
from
the
quasipotential
formulation
of gravity-capillary
waves
due
to Zhang
and
Vinals.
Our
theoretical
results
explain
a number
of
recent
experimental
results,
in
particular
the
origin
of various
superlattice
patterns.
It
also
suggests
how
one
might
design
periodic
forcing
functions
to control
pattern
selection.
We
present
examples
showing
how
we
may
control
nonlinear
resonant
triad
interactions
by
an
appropriate
choice
of
three
frequencies,
with
appropriate
phases,
for
the
forcing
function.

We reportprogress
in three
areas
of investigation
related
to dendritic
crystal
growth.
Those
items
are noted
below.
.
Selection
of tip features
dendritic
crystal
growth
It is to be
recalled
that crystalline
anisotropy
is essential
for prediction
of
tip-features
in
microscopic
solvability
theory 1. However,
the strong
dependence
of tip-features
on surface
energy
anisotropy
in the limit
as anisotropy
tends
to zero
is not
quite
consistent
with
ex-
perimental
observations
2. In some
systems
(see
explicit
examples
in reference
3) which
are
nearly
structurally
unstable,
for example
dendritic
crystal
growth
and Hele-Shaw
flow, small
perturbations
can
cause
unexpectedly
large
effects,
and
cross-over
in the scaling
results.
Through
formal
asymptotic
calculation,
we have
investigated
4 the effect
of kinetic
under-
cooling
in a two-dimensional
symmetric
model
symmetricmodel
of dendritic
crystal
growth,
with
surface
energy
and
anisotropy
included.
We notice
that
even
for small
undercooling,
there
is a lower
threshold
of surface
energy
anisotropy
beyond
which
kinetic
undercooling
effects
become
important.
We are presently
considering
such
effects
for three-dimensional
models.
.
Investigation
of nonlinear
evolution
for two-sided
model
For time evolving
dendritic
crystal
growth,
we are investigating
how small
disturbances
on
a nearly
parabolic
interface
shape
nonlinearly
evolve
away
from
the tip.
It is to be noted
that we have previously
considered
this problem
5 for one-sided
two-dimensional
model,
and
were
able
to understand
the chaotic
nature
of evolution
in terms
of complex
singularities
and
related
interracial
distortions.
We are
now
generalizing
this
approach
in a way
that
does
not require
complexification,
but relies
on derivation
of parameter
free-inner
nonlinear
integro-differential
equations
that are valid
near a spatially
localized
disturbance
6. Paramet-
ric scaling
dependencies
have
come
as bi-products
of this approach.
Our earlier
work
made
heavy
use ofconformal
mapping
5 . Since
it is not restricted
to the use ofconformal
mapping,
this current
procedure
is especially
promising
for three-dimensional
dendrites.
We expect
that
we will
be able
to determine
more
precisely
the details
of the coarsening
process
for
these
two-sided
models.

3. Rigorous
mathematical
justification
Dendritic
crystal
growth
theory
is riven
by conflicting
claims,
so one important
aspect
of this
investigation
is rigorous
mathematical
justification
for our procedures.
Some
investigators
seek
to justify
their
mathematics
by agreement
between
theory
and experiment,
even
when
the calculations
are not based
on sound
mathematics.
For instance,
there
are
scenarios
for
describing
tip-selection
based
on marginal
stability
r and
its variants 8 that are
at odds
with
microscopic
solvability.
Therefore,
it is necessary
to settle
some
of the mathematical
issues
once
for all.
We are in
the process
of developing
tools
for rigorous
mathematics
to accomplish
just that.
In the first
rigorous
study
of its kind,
we have shown 9'lo that the predictions
of microscopic
solvability
are indeed
valid for the mathematically
related
problem
of steady
fingers
in a Hele-Shaw
cell.
Dendritic
crystal
growth
involves
very similar,
though
more
complicated,
integro-differential
equations.
We anticipate
similar
results
for dendritic
growth.

Thermal
Convection
in
Two-Dimensional
Soap
Films
Jie Zhang and X.L.Wu
Department
of Physics and Astronomy
University
of Pittsburgh,
Pittsburgh,
PA 15260
Thermal
convection
in a fluid
is a common
phenomenon.
Due
to thermal
expansion,
the
light
warm
fluid
at the
bottom
tends
to
rise
and
the
cold,
heavier
fluid
at the top
tends
to fall.
This
so-called
thermal
convection
exists
in
earth
atmosphere
and
in
oceans.
It is
also
an
important
mechanism
by
which
energy
is transported
in
stars.
In this
study
we
investigate
thermal
convection
in a vertical
soap
film.
Two
aluminum
cylinders,
one
at the
top
and
one
at
the
bottom,
separated
by
about
2
cm
are
used
to
control
the
temperature
at two
constant
values,
as shown:
d
The
film
is suspended
inside
a thin
metallic
flame
to improve
transverse
heat
conduction.
The
aqueous
film
is
made
stable
by
using
a small
amount
of
surfactant
(1.5
%).
At the
steady
state,
the
film
is typically
several
microns
in
thickness,
with
a uniform
thickness
gradient
due
to
the
gravitational
stratification.
Thus,
thermal
convection
in the
soap
film
is a double
diffusive
system,
with
temperature
and
2D mass
density
forming
two
diffusive
fields.
At
a sufficiently
large
temperature
gradient,
fluid
flow
becomes
turbulent
as
delineated
below
by
a
shadow
graph
technique.
Here
the
temperature
gradient
is about
50 °C. One
observes
a frequent
emission
of thermal
plumes
at the bottom
of the
sample
along
with
a large-scale
circulation.
To study
the
thermal
turbulence
quantitatively,
power
spectra
of the temperature
field
are
measured
by a thermal
radiation
detector.
This
noninvasive
technique
allows
small
temperature
variations
to be measured
with
a high
accuracy
and
with
a
time
rate
of-100
Hz.
Our
main
observation
shows
that
the
temperature
NASA/T_2002-211211
239

power
spectrum
scales
as
a power
law
P(f)-f_,
with
ot=l.4
for
medium
temperature
gradients
and
ot=l.0
for
large
temperature
gradients,
where
f is
the frequency.
The
latter
case
(ot=l.0)
suggests
that
the temperature
field
can
behave
like
a passive
scalar,
similar
to
dispersion
of a dye
in
a turbulent
field.
Our
preliminary
observation
seems
to
suggest
that
the
crossover
between
the two
different
behaviors
is marked
by the onset
of the large-scale
circulation.
Currently
we
are
concentrated
on
measuring
the
velocity
field
simultaneously
with
the
temperature
field.
These
later
measurements
will
shed
new
light
on
the
intricate
interactions
between
the
temperature
and
velocity
fields.

ABSTRACT
The
phenomenon
of two-phase
flow
in a near
weightless
environment
(or microgravity)
is
becoming
increasingly
important.
Two-phase
flow
loops
are used
in advanced
spacecraft
thermal
management
systems
and also occur
during
the transfer
of cryogenic
propellants.
On earth,
two-
phase
annular
flow
is common
in power
plants
and many
chemical
processing
plants.
The
liquid
film
along
the tube
wall
plays
a large
role
in mass
and momentum
transfer,
featuring
a complex
wave
structure.
It is the wave
structure
phenomenon
relating
to the pressure
and
film thickness
time trace
that
is the current
interest
in this investigation.
Film
thickness
and
local
pressure
time
trace
measurements
were
taken
in normal
(earth
gravity)
and
microgravity
(g-g)
conditions
during
the
29 th and
30 th Annual
European
Space
Agency
parabolic
flight
campaign
operated
by Novespace
in Bordeaux,
France.
A high
sampling
rate
and measurement
accuracy
are essential
for a sufficient
representation
of the film thickness.
The
parallel
wire
conductance
probe,
initially
used
by
deJong
(1999),
measures
the
electrical
conductance
between
two
wires
stretched
across
the flow.
Annular
flow
film is highly
dynamic
and
hence
the
film
thickness
and
associated
local
pressure
fluctuate
rapidly.
The
instruments
require
high
frequency
response
and
minimum
damping.
The
Druck
PDCR
900
pressure
transducer
has
a frequency
response
quoted
by the
manufacturer
to be
0 to 20000
Hz.
Local
pressure
taps
were
placed
in
the
same
horizontal
plane
as
the
film
thickness
probes,
perpendicular
to the wires.
It is essential
that
the local
pressure
measurement
not interfere
with
the film phenomena,
and as such the measurements
were
made
at the tube
wall.
An
investigation
into
upward
and
downward
annular
flow
at earth's
gravity
was
made
by
Ariyadasa
(2002)
in a 9.925
mm diameter
tube.
The primary
interest
of this investigation
was the
relationship
between
the pressure
and the
film
thickness.
An investigation
was
made
by Moe
(1991)
that
examined
the
film
thickness
and
pressure
time
traces
in a horizontal
flow.
Moe
observed
the relationship
between
pressure
peaks
and film thickness
peaks
in a horizontal
flow
and
indicated
that
the
pressure
differential
might
be
enough
to exert
a significant
force
on the
waves.
Webb
and Hewitt
(1975)
observed
the pressure
peaks
that
accompanied
and
lagged
the
film
thickness
peaks.
They
concluded
that
the time
delay
exists
because
of interaction
with
the
exit condition
of the system.
Based
on the time
traces
of the film thickness
and localized
pressure
obtained
from
available
data,
the
relationship
between
the
film
thickness
and
the
pressure
under
the
wave
appear
to
indicate
some
correspondence.
Comparison
of the time
traces
consisted
of considering
the film
thickness
greater
than
one
standard
deviation
from
the mean
over
the 4 or 8 second
window.

if the film thickness
time trace
was increasing
or decreasing
as the local
pressure
was
increasing
or
decreasing,
the
relationship
was
observed.

ABSTRACT
Bubbles
and
drops
are
inhering
in many
liquid
processes
on
Earth
(microfluidics,
MEMS
technology,
flows
through
porous
media
etc.)
and
in
space
laboratory
under
gg
conditions
(preparation
composite
materials,
degassing
of liquefied
matter,
recycling
of waste
material).
They
could
have
affected
these
processes
significantly.
Therefore
the
study
of behavior
these
capillary
objects
is necessary
in order
to develop
the efficient
methods
of manipulation
of them
in situ.
The best
solution
of such
problem
is the use
of surface
forces,
which
are aroused
when
the
surface
tension
locally
is departed
from
its equilibrium
value
as a result
of thermal,
concentration
or electrical
perturbations
at interface,
Vo = o'T I c,_ V T + O'c I T,_ V C +o'_
I c,T V q0
Among
the known
methods
of control
of surface
tension
the most
promising
is the thermal
one.
However,
the generation
of motion
of capillary
objects
by the thermal
gradients
imposed
in
liquid
bulk
(or
along
solid
substrate)
by
conduction
is a passive
method,
which
requires
large
amount
of energy.
In this paper
the new method
of generation
of motion
of bubbles
and drops
in microchannels
or Hele-Show
cells
are reported.
This
method
based
on photoinduced
solutocapillary
convection
discovered
by Bezuglyi
[1,2].
This
motion
can
be
caused
through
simultaneously
acting
thermocapillary
(TC)
and
solutocapillary
(SC)
forces,
which
are induced
by a light beam
at the interface
of the bubbles
and
drops.
A
competition
between
these
two
forces
takes
place.
A criterion
which
measures
the
importance
of
surface
tension
gradient,
(VG)c
= G'cV
C,
related
to
concentration
gradient
against
surface
tension
gradient,
(VG)T = G'TV T, caused
by thermal
gradient
is a dimensionless
number
CT = (VG)c/(VG)T.
If CT>
1, then
the capillary
motion
is caused
by SC forces.
When
CT < 1, drops
and bubbles
move
due to TC forces.
The behavior
of the gas bubble
of various
diameter
in a thin layer
(10-
100 gm)
of solution
tensioactive
substance
in a high
volatile
solvent
sandwiched
between
two
glass
plates
and the
growth
of
drops
within
bubbles
under
light
radiation
have
been
studied.
Continuous
and
intermittent
motions
of bubbles
for numbers
CT < 1 and
CT > 1, respectively,
were
revealed.
First,
the division
of kidneylike
bubble
[3] in irradiated
region
was
demonstrated.
It was found,
that the rate of drop
growth
within
bubble
is increased
when
the diameter
of bubble
is decreased.

INTRODUCTION
The
magnetic
Kelvin
force
has
been
proposed
as
an
artificial
gravity
to
control
the
orientation
of
paramagnetic
liquid
propellants
such
as
liquid
oxygen
in
a
microgravity
environment.
This
paper
reports
experiments
performed
in the
NASA
"Weightless
Wonder"
KC-135
aircraft,
through
the
Reduced
Gravity
Student
Flight
Opportunities
Program.
The
aircraft
flies
through
a series
of parabolic
arcs
providing
about
25 s of microgravity
in each
arc.
The
experiment
was
conceived,
designed,
constructed,
and
performed
by
the
undergraduate
student
team
and their
two
faculty
advisors.
Two
types
of tanks
were
tested:
square-base
prismatic
tanks
5 cm x 5 cm x 8.6 cm and
circular
cylinders
5 cm in diameter
and
8.6 cm tall.
The
paramagnetic
liquid
was
a 3.3 molar
solution
of MnCI2
in water.
Tests
were
performed
with
each type
of tank
filled
to depths
of 1 cm
and 4 cm.
Each
test compared
a pair of tanks
that
were
identical
except
that the base
of one was
a pole
face
of a 0.6 Tesla
permanent
magnet.
The Kelvin
force
attracts
paramagnetic
materials
toward
regions
of higher
magnetic
field.
It was
hypothesized
that
the Kelvin
force
would
hold
the liquid
in the bottom
of the tanks
during
the periods
of microgravity.
The tanks
were
installed
in a housing
that
could
slide
on rails
transverse
to the flight
direction.
By manually
shoving
the
housing,
an identical
impulse
could
be provided
to each
tank
at the beginning
of each
period
of
microgravity.
The resulting
fluid
motions
were
videotaped
for later
analysis.
RESULTS
As
summarized
in Table
1, positive
results
(more
liquid
was
confined
to the bottom
of
the magnet
tank
than
in the non-magnet
control
tank)
were
obtained
in 86 out of 89 tests.
For
3
tests with
relatively
large
impulses,
the magnetic
and non-magnetic
results
were
comparable.
No
negative
results
were
observed.
As
expected,
the
Kelvin
force
was
much
more
effective
in
controlling
the liquid
in the shallower
liquid
cases.

In every
one of the Case
1 tests,
the magnet
held
the liquid
interface
essentially
flat after
the initial
sloshing
transient
quickly
damped
out.
In the control
tanks,
the liquid
quickly
moved
to the top of the tank
in 23 cases.
In the remaining
4 tests,
the interface
tilted
1-6 cm, eventually
reaching
the top
of the tank
in 3 tests.
Figure
1 shows
an example
of the Case
1 results.
The
tank
with the magnet
is on the left of the image.
Among
the Case
2 tests,
6 had no input
impulse.
In these
the magnet
held
the liquid
with
an essentially
flat interface,
while
in the
control
tanks
the liquid
moved
to the top in 3 tests
and
exhibited
a tilting
interface
in 3 tests.
For
1 test
in which
multiple
input
impulses
set up
a
swirling
motion,
the magnet
tank
showed
a smaller
amount
of the liquid
at the top
of the tank
than
the control
tank.
In 5 tests
with
impulse,
the magnet
held
the
liquid
with
a flat interface,
while
the
liquid
either
moved
to the
top
of the
tank
or tilted
significantly
from
a horizontal
position
in the control
tests.
For
the remaining
6 tests
approximately
half of the liquid
remained
in the bottom
of the tank
for the magnet
tanks,
while
essentially
all of the liquid
moved
to the top
in the control
tanks.
Figure
2 is a Case
2 image;
the magnet
is visible
below
the right
hand
tank.
In Case
3, there
were
17 tests in the which
magnet
allowed
the interface
to tilt noticeably,
but kept
the liquid
from
reaching
the top
of the tanks,
and 9 in which
the tilting
was followed
by
some
of the liquid
moving
to the top
of the tank
near
the test's
end.
In the control
tanks,
there
were
17 tests
in which
the bulk
of the liquid
moved
quickly
to the top
of the tank,
and usually
moved
back
down
to the bottom
of the tank,
with
the cycle
repeating
one
or more
times.
In the
remaining
9 control
tank
tests,
most
of the liquid
would
move
to the top
of the
tank
and
stay
there
for most
of the parabola.
Figure
3 is a Case
3 image;
the magnet
is below
the right
hand
tank.
In the
Case
4 tests,
there
were
6 with
no input
impulse.
For
4 of these
tests
the magnet
tank
showed
a tilted
interface
that
never
reached
the top
of the
tank,
while
for
2 some
liquid
eventually
went
to the top
of the tank.
Of the no-impulse
control
tank
cases,
4 had more
liquid
go to the top
of the tank,
while
2 had
an interface
that
tilted
more
than
for the
corresponding
magnet
tanks.
For
the
3 tests
in which
multiple
input
impulses
set up a swirling
motion,
the
magnet
cases
showed
a smaller
amount
of the liquid
at the top of the tank
than
the controls.
In 6
additional
tests
an average
of 65%
of the liquid
was near
the tank
bottom
for the magnet
tanks
compared
with an average
of 30%
for the controls.
In 3 tests
there
was no significant
difference
between
the magnet
and control
tanks.

ABSTRACT
We
have
pursued
the
use
of
biological
crosslinking
molecules
of
several
types
to
make
colloidal
materials
at relatively
low
volume
fraction
of
colloidal
particles.
The
objective
is to
make
binary
alloys
of colloidal
particles,
made
of two
different
colloidal
particles
coated
with
complementary
biological
lock-and-key
binding
molecules,
which
assemble
due to the biological
specificity.
The long-term
goal
is to use low
affinity
lock-and-key
biological
interactions,
so that
the colloidal
systems
can anneal
to form
crystalline
states.
We have
used
a variety
of different
surface
chemistries
in order
to make
colloidal
materials.
Our first
system
involved
using
selectin-carbohydrate
(sialyl-Lewis
X) interactions;
this
chemistry
is derived
from
immune
system.
This
chemical
interaction
is of relatively
low affinity,
with time-
scales
for
dissociation
of
several
seconds.
Furthermore,
the
adhesion
mediated
by
these
molecules
can be reversed
by the chelation
of calcium
atoms;
thus
assembled
structures
can
be
disassembled
reversibly.
Our second
system
employed
avidin-biotin
chemistry.
This
well-studied
system
is of high affinity,
and is generally
irreversible
on a laboratory
time-scale.
Thus,
we would
expect
selectin-carbohydrate
interactions
at high molecular
density
and avidin-biotin
interactions
to give
kinetically-trapped
structures;
however,
at low
densities,
we
would
expect
significant
differences
in the
structure
and
dynamics
of
the
two
materials,
owing
to their
very
different
release
rates.
We
have
also
begun
to
use
a third
chemistry
-
DNA
hybridization.
By
attaching
single
stranded
DNA
oligonucleotide
chains
to beads,
we can
drive
the assembly
of colloidal
materials
by hybridization
of complementary
DNA
chains.
It is well
known
that
DNA
adenosine-thymine
(A-T)
and guanine-cytosine
(G-C)
bases
hybridize
pairwise
with
a Gibbs
free energy
change
of
-
1.7 kcal/mol
per base;
thus,
the energy
of the assembly
can be modulated
by altering
the number
of complementary
bases
in the DNA
chains.
Using
these
different
crosslinking
molecules,
we
have
assembled
colloidal
materials
from
different-sized
colloidal
particles,
A and B. In the first
sets of experiment,
we used
high densities
of adhesion
molecules,
and
0.96
micron
(A)
and
5.5
micron
(B)
diameter
particles.
The
high
density
of
adhesion
molecules
means
that
the
structures
are
kinetically
trapped
in
non-
equilibrium
configurations.
The
structure
of
the
suspension
can
be
varied
by
changing
the
number
ratio
of the two
types
of colloidal
particles,
NA and NB, where
A is the smaller
particle.
With
carbohydrate-selectin
or avidin-biotin
interactions,
large
NA/NB leads
to the formation
of
colloidal
micelles,
with
the large
center
B particle
surrounded
by many
smaller
A particles
(see
Figure
1). As the
ratio
NA/NB decreases,
the structures
become
more
extended,
approaching
the
formation
of macro-Rouse
polymers
- extended
linear
chains
where
A beads
are connected
with
intervening
small
B linkers.
NASA/T_2002-211211
251

When
the
structures
are
made
with
selectin-carbohydrate
interactions,
the
chelation
of
calcium
using
EDTA
can cause
the structures
to disassemble
entirely.
Also,
the addition
of EDTA
prior
to the mixing
of the suspension
can prevent
the structures
from
forming.
a
b
Figure
1. Assembly
of colloidal
structures
using
biotin-avidin
interactions.
At high
densities
of NA/NB
(A),
a large
B particle
is surrounded
by many
A particles.
At
low
densities
of NA/NB
(B),
extended
chains
are formed.
When
the
density
of selectin-carbohydrate
molecules
is decreased,
the
binding
of small
A
beads
to the central
B particle
becomes
transient.
The time-scale
for release
of A particles
from
the
surface
of the
central
B particle
is an
increasing
function
of the
molecular
density.
The
density
of
molecules
on
the
A particles
can
be
changed
by
the
concentration
of
molecular
incubation,
and verified
with
flow
cytometry.
The time
scale
of release
of many
particles
can be
tracked,
and
compared
to a simple
probabilistic
binding
model
for molecular
dissociation.
The
decay
of
bound
(docked)
particles
can
be
fit to
determine
the
intrinsic
binding
dissociation
constants.
The
uni-molecular
dissociation
constant
for
sialyl-LewisX/E-selectin
interactions
determined
this
way
is
approximately
1 sec -1, which
corresponds
to
the
off
rate
measured
separately
for this interaction
by other
laboratories.
We
have
also
been
measuring
the
rheology
and
assembly
of resultant
colloidal
suspension
using
micro-rheometry.
This
has
involved
bulk
rheological
measurements,
as
well
as
the
dynamics
of colloidal
assembly
using
confocal
microscopy
(where
the smaller
bead
species,
A, is
fluorescent,
and its position
is tracked
with time).
At 10 % total
volume
fraction,
and a bead
ratio
NA/NB
=
10,
colloidal
materials
assembled
using
avidin-biotin
interactions
exhibit
a
characteristic
shear
thinning
behavior
over
a wide
range
of shear
stresses.
A long-term
goal
is to
compare
the time-constants
for shear
thinning
behavior
as a function
of the density
and strength
of the biological
molecules.
Finally,
we
have
made
significant
progress
in
assembling
small
aggregates
of
colloidal
particles
that
are crosslinked
by DNA
hybridization.
Avidin-coated
particles
were
coated
with
30
base
pair
DNA
sequences
(a and b) that
had 20 bp overlapping
sequences.
The
sequences
were
made
with
biotin
at the
5' end
and the fluorescent
dye
Cy5
at the 3' end.
The presence
of the
oligonucleotide
strands
on
the
beads
was
verified
by fluorescence
flow
cytometry.
Since
the
hydbridization
of DNA
depends
on temperature
and the length
of overlap
of the DNA
bases,
we
will explore
the effect
of temperature
and chain
length
on the ability
for assemble
stable
colloidal
structures
using
DNA
hybridization
with
different
lengths
of chain
overlap.

ABSTRACT
Introduction:
Microgravity
alters
transvascular
pressure
differential
and
transmural
flow
across
blood
vessel
walls.
We have
hypothesized
that changes
in transmural
flow
alter
fluid shear
stress
on vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
(SMC)
and this in turn
affects
the state
of contraction
or "tone"
of SMC.
Since
the cardiovascular
system
relies
on SMC
contraction
in arterioles
in response
to
changes
in pressure
("myogenic
response")
to regulate
blood
flow
to tissue
beds
which
in turn
affects
transvascular
exchange,
we
have
investigated
the
effects
of
fluid
flow
shear
stress
on
SMC
contraction
using
both
in vitro
and in vivo
models.
In Vitro
Studies:
Primary rat aortic
SMC
were
expanded
in cell culture
flasks
containing
DMEM
+ 10% FBS.
Then
the cells
were
"starved"
(maintained
in DMEM,
no FBS)
in culture
flasks
for
two
to three
days
and then
on quartz
slides
at sub-confluent
density
for two
more
days
prior
to
experiments
that were
also run serum-free.
SMC
starving
was necessary
to induce
the contractile
phenotype.
To study
cell contraction
in response
to shear
stress,
sub-confluent
cells
on quartz
slides
were
exposed
to defined
levels
of steady
shear
stress
in a parallel
plate
flow
chamber
for
30 minutes
while
being
photographed
under
a microscope
with
a video
camera.
Reduction
in
cell
area
was
interpreted
as cell
contraction
and
quantified
in terms
of percent
area
reduction.
Intra-cellular
calcium
(Ca 2+ ) was
imaged
under
flow
in the
parallel
plate
chamber
using
the
calcium
sensitive
dye fura-2.
Cells
in the contractile
phenotype
that
were
exposed
to 25 dyne/cm
2 shear
stress
decreased
their
area
significantly
within
3 minutes
and by more
than
30%
after
30 minutes.
The threshold
for
contraction
was
about
7
dyne/cm
2.
To
our
surprise,
this
contraction
response
was
not
accompanied
by a response
of intracellular
Ca 2+. Additional
experiments
in calcium
free media
and
with
an intracellular
calcium
chelator
also
displayed
a significant
contraction
response
to
shear
stress
confirming
that
shear-induced
contraction
is not
mediated
by
intracellular
Ca 2+.
Additional
pharmacological
experiments
suggested
that
the
shear-induced
contraction
is
mediated
primarily
through
a Rho-kinase
intracellular
signaling
pathway.
In contrast,
cells
in the
proliferative
phenotype
(maintained
in serum)
did not
contract
in response
to shear
stress
but
did
display
a marked
intracellular
Ca 2+ response
to shear.

Discussion:
The
in vitro
results
show
that
an
increase
in fluid
shear
stress
causes
SMC
to
contract
in a calcium-independent
manner
suggesting
that
increased
fluid
shear
stress
on SMC
associated
with
increased
transmural
flow
may
drive
the myogenic
response
in arterioles.
The in
vivo
results,
which
show
that
a reduction
in transmural
flow
induced
by
an
osmotic
solution
reduces
the
myogenic
response,
are
consistent
with
the
in
vitro
results.
These
experiments
support
a new
hypothesis
for the mechanical
basis
of the myogenic
response
that
invokes
fluid
shear
stress.
The new
hypothesis
has important
implications
for vascular
control
and
fluid
shift
in microgravity
since
transmural
flow
is altered
by microgravity.

ABSTRACT
The
lung
consists
of a network
of bifurcating
tubes
that
are coated
with
a thin
viscous
film.
In
the
case
of disease,
the
liquid
film
can
form
a meniscus
which
plugs
the
tube,
thus
obstructing
gas
exchange.
The
formation
of the
liquid
meniscus
is due
to capillary
driven
instabilities
which
arise
in the
lining
causing
it to
close
up.
Airflow
can
also
be
obstructed
if the
airway
tube
collapses
in on itself.
This
occurs
when
the
elastic
forces
of the
tube
are
not
large
enough
to sustain
the
negative
fluid
pressures
inside
the
tube
caused
by surface-tension,
and
the
tube
collapses.
Closure
of the
airway
can
be
due
to
either,
or a combination
of, these
mechanisms.
In
any
case
the
instability
is dependent
on the
surface
tension
of the
liquid
lining
and
the
presence,
or lack
of, surfactants.
Premature
babies,
whose
lungs
have
not
developed
sufficient
surfactant
to maintain
the
surface
tension
of the
lung
at a sufficiently
low level for
healthy
functioning,
are espe-
cially
predisposed
to problems
caused
by airway
closure.
In such
cases,

For

the

of the

as well
as the
tidal
volume,
are
two
control
parameters
at
the
disposal
of the
clin-
ician.
Little
is known,
however,
of the
effect
that
these
two
parameters
can
have
on the
occurrence
of airway
closure.
Indeed,
if airways
can
be
kept
open
by using
some
given
machine
frequency
or amplitude,
thus
causing
mechanical
perturbations
to the
unstable
interface,
then
this
would
important
in the
treatment
of such
patients.
In
normal
gravity,
airway
closure
tends
to occur
in the
lower
regions
of the
lung,
due
to the
weight
of the
lung
above,
and
at
the
end
of expiration
when
the
lung
volume,
and
hence
airway
radii,
are
smallest.
The
transient
blockage
of gas
exchange
in the
affected
tubes
occurs
in only
part
of the
lung,
the
other
portions
remaining
open.
In the
microgravity
environment,
airway
closure
is a potentially
significant
issue
since
ventilation
and
airway
closure
are more
homogeneous,
leaving
less
of the
lung
to be open
during
end
expiration.
Preventiou
of airway
closure
in this
setting
may
be useful.
We model
the
phenomenon
of airway
closure
by considering
the
stability
of a thin
film
coating
the
inner
surface
of a rigid
cylindrical
tube.

THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
INTERFACIAL
STRESSES
DURING
PULMONARY
AIRWAY

IN
MICROGRAVITY

ABSTRACT
Pulmonary
airway
closure
is a potentially
dangerous
event
that
can
occur
in microgravity
environments
and
may
result
in limited
gas
exchange
for
flight
crew
during
long-term
space
flight.
Repetitive
airway
collapse
and
reopening
subjects
the
pulmonary
epithelium
to large,
dynamic,
and
potentially
injurious
mechanical
stresses.
During
ventilation
at low
lung
volumes
and pressures,
airway
instability
leads
to repetitive
collapse
and reopening.
During
reopening,
air
must
progress
through
a collapsed
airway,
generating
stresses
on the
airway
walls,
potentially
damaging
airway
tissues.
The
normal
lung
can
tolerate
repetitive
collapse
and
reopening.
However,
combined
with
insufficient
or dysfunctional
pulmonary
surfactant
repetitive
airway
collapse
and
reopening
produces
severe
lung
injury.
Particularly
at
risk
is
the
pulmonary
epithelium.
As an important
regulator
of lung
function
and physiology,
the degree
of pulmonary
epithelial
damage
influences
the course
and outcome
of lung
injury.
Two
companion
studies,
an
experimental
investigation
and
computational
fluid
dynamic
simulation,
are
presented
that
address
the
hypothesis
that
the
mechanical
stresses
associated
with
airway
reopening
inflict
injury
to the pulmonary
epithelium.
Experimental
Investigation
A parallel
plate
chamber
lined
with pulmonary
epithelial
cells was constructed
as an idealized
model
of a collapsed
segment
of an airway
where
the walls
are held
in opposition
by a viscous
fluid.
A fetal rat pulmonary
epithelial
cell line (CCL-149,
ATCC)
was cultured
to confluence
on a
small
(1
cm2),
square
region
of the upper
plate.
The narrow
channel
was
filled
a model
airway
lining
fluid.
Phosphate
buffered
saline
including
0.1 mg/mL
CaCI2
and
MgSO4
(PBS)
was used
to model
a surfactant-deficient
airway
lining
fluid.
A surfactant-containing
airway
lining
fluid
was
approximated
using
Infasurf
(ONY,
Inc.)
diluted
to 1 mg/mL
phospholipid
concentration
in
PBS.
Airway
"reopening"
was generated
by the
steady
progression
of a semi-infinite
bubble
of
air down
the length
of the channel
using
a constant
rate infusion
pump
(7 or 70 mL/min).
For the
control,
slides
were
soaked
in PBS
for 5 minutes.
A digital
camera
mounted
above
the channel
collected
sequential
overhead
images
of the
progressing
bubble,
which
were
used
to calculate
bubble
velocity.
Once
removed
from
the
apparatus,
the
slide
was
incubated
with
1.2 glVi
Ethidium
homodimer-1
(Eth-1)
and
1.2 gM
calcein
AM
(Molecular
Probes).
For
each
slide,
the
number
of injured
cells
was recorded
as the
average
number
of Eth-1
stained
nuclei
counted
in
fluorescence
microscopic
images.
Fluid
Dynamic
Simulations
The
bubble
and
parallel-plate
flow
chamber
was
modeled
as
a
semi-infinite
bubble
progressing
within
a Hele-Shaw
cell.
In this
model
the walls
were
separated
by a distance
2//,
with
the
semi-infinite
bubble
progressing
in the x-direction

The

Ca = _tU/y, representing

of

to surface
tension
effects
on
the
bubble
determines
the
dynamic
response
of
the
system.
Stokes
equations,
VP
= _tVZu and V • u = O, were
solved
using
the boundary
element
method.
The
interfacial
stress
condition
applied
at the
air-liquid
interface
was
Icy.h
I=y_h,
where
o- = -PI
+ #(Vu
+ Vu T) was
the
stress
tensor,
h
was
the
unit
normal,
and
x was
the
interfacial
curvature.
For
a given
Ca, the system
was simulated
until
a steady-state
meniscus
had
developed
and the stress-field
and bubble
geometry
were
determined.
Three
potentially
injurious
components
of the stress
cycle
associated
with bubble
progression
- the shear
stress,
the shear
stress
gradient,
and the pressure
gradient
- were
analyzed.
Regression
relationships
describing
the behavior
of these
components
as a function
of Ca were
determined
for very
small
Ca (5 ×
10 -4 _<Ca < 2 ×
10-3).
Additionally,
the thickness
of the thin film
deposited
by bubble
progression
was
estimated.
Dimensionless
values
for the experimental
flow
conditions
were
extrapolated
from
the regression
equations
and redimensionalized.
Results
and Discussion
For
each
condition
the average
number
of injured
cells
per square
centimeter
was measured
(Table
1).
The
control
showed
few
injured
cells.
For
the
saline-occluded
channels,
bubble
progression
at both
velocities
produced
significantly
increased
numbers
of injured
cells
when
compared
to the control.
The slow
velocity
resulted
in a 66-fold
increase
in the number
of injured
cells
and the fast velocity
produced
a 20-fold
increase.
The
addition
of Infasurf
to the occlusion
fluid
reduced
the number
of injured
cells
to a level
similar
to the
control.
These
results
support
the
hypotheses
that
mechanical
stresses
associated
with
airway
reopening
injure
pulmonary
epithelial
cells
and
that
pulmonary
surfactant
in the normal
lung
protects
the
epithelium
from
injury
due to airway
reopening.
The
stress
component
that
best
agrees
with
the
experimentally
observed
trauma
is the
maximal
pressure
gradient
(Table
1). Pressure
gradients
create
a force
imbalance
on the
cell
membrane
over the length
of the cell. For
a low profile,
predominately
flat cell or region
of a cell,
the non-uniformly
distributed
load
can
depress
region
of the
cell stretching
the membrane.
For
high
profile
cells
or regions
of a cell,
such
as the protrusion
cause
by the nucleus,
where
the
normal
forces
of the
cell surface
are nearly
opposite,
a pressure
gradient
will
pinch
that
region.
The pinching
can tear the membrane
at the base
of the protrusion
or force
fluid upward
rupturing
the top surface
of the cell.

ABSTRACT
An improved
method
is presented
for measuring
protein
virial
coefficients
from
retention
time measurements
in size exclusion
chromatography
(SEC).
Second
virial
coefficients
for the
self-interaction
of lysozyme
have been
determined
by analyzing
the concentration
dependence
of
the partition
coefficient
obtained
from
SEC
studies
on silica
beads.
Our SEC results
show
agreement
with
virial
coefficients
obtained
by light
scattering.
It is well
known
in the standard
practice
of size exclusion
liquid
chromatography
(SEC)
that
the
solute
retention
time
depends
sensitively
on the
solute's
excluded
volume.
It has also
been
realized
that
the
thermodynamic
non-ideality
resulting
from
any
excluded
volume
leads
to
a
concentration
dependence
of the retention
time 1, and that such
dependence
can be utilized
to

Although
frontal
chromatography
allows
one
to
fix
the
solute
concentration
in
the
column
directly,
it requires
a large
amount
of protein
(= 2.5g
) and (prohibitively)
long

times
(= 2 days).
We extend
their
method
to modem
SEC,
which
necessitates
a consideration
of the
solute
concentration
in the
column.
This
adaptation
drastically
reduces
the
amount
of protein
(= 25rag
) and time
needed
(= 2 hours)
to measure
B z by SEC.
We show
that
our results
for B z
from
SEC
compare
quantitatively
well
to light
scattering
measurements,
and that

MICRO-FLUID

IN AN
EVAPORATING

DROPLET:
APPLICATION

DNA
OPTICAL

ABSTRACT
The
flow
field
proposed
by a drying,
sessile
droplet
has been
used
by
Jing,
et al. (1998)
to
stretch
and adhere
DNA
molecules
to
derivatized
glass
substrate,
as
a preparation
for
optical
gene
analysis
using
restriction
enzymes.
We
have
carried
out
experimental,
analytical,
and
numerical
analysis
of the flow
field in an evaporating
droplet,
and combined
this flow
field with
a
Brownian
dynamics
analysis
of
polymer
deformation
to
predict
the
conformations
of
DNA
molecules
adhered
to
the
substrate
in
this
flow.
We
have
compared
these
predictions
to
experimental
observations
and
measurements
of the
DNA
configurations,
obtaining
excellent
agreement.
The results
indicate
that
combined
hydrodynamic/Brownian
dynamic
analyses
can be
used
to design
flows
for micro-manipulation
of DNA,
for gene analysis.
The
flow
fields
in the
evaporating
droplet,
obtained
from
a finite
element
analysis
and
from
an analytic
lubrication
analysis
are
similar
qualitatively.
However
there
are
some
quantitative
differences
that
can be traced
to the boundary
condition
at the air-fluid
interface,
which
reduces
to a zero
axial gradient
in radial
velocity
in the
case
of the
lubrication
approximation,
but
which
does
not quite
hold
in the numerical
analysis,
due to the radial
gradient
in evaporation
rate.
The
analytic
flow
field
is then
combined
with
a Brownian
dynamics
method
to predict
the
stretching
and deposition
of DNA
molecules
to a glass
substrate
treated
with
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES)
to induce
irreversible
adsorption
of DNA
In the
Brownian
dynamics
simulation,
the
DNA
molecule
is represented
as a bead-spring
chain,
with
parameters
chosen
from
known
elastic
and hydrodynamic
properties
of lambda-phage
DNA.
Any
bead
coming
into
contact
with
the
substrate
due to a combination
of flow
and Brownian
motion
is "frozen"
to the surface.
An image of DNAmolecules
adhered
to the treated
glass
substrate
is shown
in Fig.
1. Fig.
2
analyzes
the
distribution
of
stretch
length
and
orientation
angle,
relative
to
the
radial
flow
direction,
from
many
such
images,
and compares
the results
to the
predictions
of the Brownian
dynamics
simulations.
The
agreement
is very
good,
indicating
that
analysis
of
DNA
molecular
dynamics
and surface
adhesion
in complex
flows
is now possible.
We are extending
this
work
to
flow
in a channel,
and
to
electrostatic
manipulations
of
DNA
molecules,
with
the
aim
of
developing
tools
for
manipulation
of DNA
single
molecules
in microfabricated
devices.
Such
devices
are of growing
interest
in the biomedical
community
and for space
applications,
including
space
flight.

ABSTRACT
As a "window
to the body",
the eye
offers
the opportunity
to use light
in various
forms
to
detect
ocular
and systemic
abnormalities
long before
clinical
symptoms
appear
and help
develop
preventative/therapeutic
countermeasures
early.
The
effects
of space
travel
on human
body
are
similar
to
those
of
normal
aging.
For
example,
radiation
exposure
in
space
could
lead
to
formation
of
cataracts
and
cancer
by
damaging
the
DNA
and
causing
gene
mutation.
Additionally,
the zero-gravity
environment
causes
fluid shifts
in the upper
extremities
of the body
and changes
the way blood
flows
and organ
system
performs.
Here
on Earth,
cataract,
age-related
macular
degeneration
(AMD),
diabetic
retinopathy
(DR),
and
glaucoma
are major
eye diseases
and are expected
to double
in next
two decades.
To detect,
prevent,
and treat
untoward
effects
of
prolonged
space
travel
in
real-time
requires
the
development
of
non-invasive
diagnostic
technologies
that
are compact
and powerful.
We
are developing
fiber-optic
sensors
to evaluate
the
ocular
tissues
in health,
aging,
and
disease
employing
the
techniques
of
dynamic
light
scattering
(cataract,
uveitis,
Alzheimer's,
glaucoma,
DR,
radiation
damage,
refractive
surgery
outcomes),
auto-fluorescence
(aging,
DR),
laser-Doppler
flowmetry
(choroidal
blood
flow),
Raman
spectroscopy
(AMD),
polarimetry
(diabetes),
and
retinal
oximetry
(occult
blood
loss).
The non-invasive
feature
of these
technologies
integrated
in a head-mounted/goggles-like
device
permits
frequent
repetition
of
tests,
enabling
evaluation
of
the
results
to
therapy
that
may
ultimately
be useful
in various
telemedicine
applications
on Earth
and in space.

ABSTRACT
One of the longest
standing
unsolved
problems
in physics
relates
to the behavior
of fluids
that are driven
far from
equilibrium
such
as occurs
when
they become
turbulent
due to fast flow
through
a grid or tidal motions.
In turbulent
flows
the distribution
of
vortex
energy
as a function
of
the inverse
length
scale
[or wavenumber
'k']ofmotion
is
proportional
to 1/k 5/3which
is the celebrated
law of
Kolmogorov.
Although
this law
gives
a good description
of the average
motion,
fluctuations
around
the average
are huge.
This
stands
in contrast
with thermally
activated
motion
where
large
fluctuations
around
thermal
equilibrium
are highly
unfavorable.
The problem
of turbulence
is the problem
of
understanding
why
large
fluctuations
are so prevalent
which
is also called
the problem
of
"intermittency".
Turbulence
is a remarkable
problem
in that its solution
sits simultaneously
at the
forefront
of physics,
mathematics,
engineering
and computer
science.
A recent
conference
[March
2002]
on "Statistical
Hydrodynamics"
organized
by the Los Alamos
Laboratory
Center
for Nonlinear
Studies
brought
together
researchers
in all of these
fields.
Although
turbulence
is generally
thought
to be described
by the Navier-Stokes
Equations
of fluid mechanics
the solution
as well as its existence
has eluded
researchers
for over
100 years.
In fact proof
of the existence
of such
a solution
qualifies
for a 1MS
millennium
prize.
As part of our NASA
funded
research
we have proposed
building
a bridge
between
vortex
turbulence
and wave
turbulence.
The latter
occurs
when
high
amplitude
waves
of various
wavelengths
are allowed
to mutually
interact
in a fluid.
In particular
we
have proposed
measuring
the interaction
of ripples
[capillary
waves]
that run around
on
the surface
of a fluid
sphere
suspended
in a microgravity
environment.
The problem
of ripple
turbulence
poses
similar
mathematical
challenges
to the
problem
of vortex
turbulence.
The waves
can have
a high
amplitude
and a strong
nonlinear
interaction.
Furthermore,
the steady
state
distribution
of energy
again
follows
a
Kolmogorov
scaling
law;
in this case
the ripple
energy
is distributed
according
to
1/k 7/4.
Again,
in parallel
with vortex
turbulence
ripple
turbulence
exhibits
intermittency
[Wright
et al Science
278,
1609 (97)].
The problem
of ripple
turbulence
presents
an experimental
opportunity
to
generate
data in a controlled,
benchmarked
system.
In particular
the surface
of a sphere
is
an ideal
environment
to study
ripple
turbulence.
Waves
run around
the sphere
and
interact
with each
other,
and the effect
of walls
is eliminated.
In microgravity
this state
can be realized
for over 2 decades
of frequency.
Wave
turbulence
is a physically
relevant
problem
in its own right.
It has been
studied
on the surface
of liquid
hydrogen
[Brazhnikov
et al] and its application
to Alfven
waves
in space
is a source
of debate.[P.
Goldreich].

to ocean

has been
a major
success

E. Zakharov.
[Kolmogorov
Spectra
of Turbulence,
Springer,
Berlin
1992].
The experiment
which
we plan
to run in microgravity
is conceptually
straightforward.
Ripples
are excited
on the surface
of a spherical
drop
of
fluid
and then
their
amplitude
is recorded
with appropriate
photography.
A key challenge
is posed
by
the need
to stably
position
a 10cm diameter
sphere
of water
in microgravity.
Two
methods
are being
developed.
Orbitec
is using
controlled
puffs
of air from
at least
6
independent
directions
to provided
the positioning
force.
This approach
has actually
succeeded
to position
and stabilize
a 4cm sphere
during
a KC
135 segment.
Guigne
International
is using
the radiation
pressure
of high
frequency
sound.
These
transducers
have been
organized
into a device
in the shape
of a dodecahedron.
This apparatus
'SPACE
DRUMS'
has already
been
approved
for use for combustion
synthesis
experiments
on the International
Space
Station.
A key opportunity
presented
by the ripple
turbulence
data is its use in driving
the
development
of
codes
to simulate
its properties.
A head
start
on this aspect
of the project
is being
developed
at NASA
Glenn
Research
Center.

ABSTRACT
A pure
liquid-gas
mixture
is one of the simplest
examples
of a soft-matter
system.
In fact,
when
co-existing
gas and liquid
phases
of pure
fluid
are heated
to their
critical
point,
large-scale
density
fluctuations
make
the fluid
extremely
compressible
(to external
forces),
expandable
(to
heating),
slows
the
diffusive
transport,
and
decreases
the
surface
tension.
In principle
these
properties
and
others
either
diverge
to infinity
or converge
to zero
at the critical
temperature.
These
properties
lead
to some
very
unusual
behavior:
large
density
gradients
at the laboratory
scale,
a large
mechanical
response
to heating,
and perfect
wetting
of a solid
wall
by the liquid
phase
(zero
contact-angle).
We have
further
simplified
this system
by performing
experiments
in
weightlessness
(Mir
spaces
station).
By controlling
the fluid's
temperature,
these
properties
may
be varied
over
large
ranges
in a single
sample.
When
the fluid
is driven
out of equilibrium
by a
fast temperature
quench
from
the single-phase
(supercritical
fluid)
state
into the two-phase
state,
we
have
observed
universal
growth
laws
of
minority
domains
(gas
bubbles)
during
phase
separation.
Prior
to
this
quench
we
have
also
observed
density
fluctuations
using
optical
microscopy
near
the
critical
point.
When
heat
is applied
to
a liquid-gas
mixture,
we
have
observed
a spectacular
spreading
of a gas bubble
along
a hot
solid
wall
as well
as gas bubble
over-heating
(where
the interior
of
a gas bubble
gains
a higher
temperature
than
the
heating
wall).
Although
this
gas
phase
over-heating
appears
to violate
the
second
law,
it is really
a
transient
our-of-equilibrium
effect.
Inside
of
these
unusual
bubbles
we
also
have
observed
unusually
large
variations
in
liquid
wetting
film
thickness
that
often
appear
to evolve
into
spreading
contact
lines
on the sapphire
wall
when
heat is applied.
We
have
observed
coarsening
and growth
of minority
domains
(gas bubbles)
in SF6 near
its liquid-gas
critical
point.
Phase
separation
in our constant
density
samples
was induced
in our
constant
volume
cells
by temperature
quenches
in
weightless
conditions
(Mir
station),
while
visualizing
density
fluctuations
and
domain
growth
using
optical
microscopy.
The
optics
of the
formation
of the density
fluctuation
images
will
be discussed.
The
well-known
statistics
of the
density
fluctuations
provide
natural
space
and
time
scales
for
domain
growth.
Previous
experiments
have
documented
two
morphologies
and two
associated
growth
laws
with
a sharp
transition
between
the
two.
This
transition
appears
to be
controlled
by
the
minority
volume
fraction.
While
the slow,
t 1/3growth,
for disconnected
morphologies,
is understood
as a diffusion
process,
the
fast
growth,
t 1 growth,
for
connected
domains,
is less
well-understood.
We
will
discuss
several
shallow
quenching
sequences
at the critical
density
(___0.02%) and
slightly
off-
critical
where
we have
observed
fast linear
growth.

When
a coexisting
liquid-gas
mixture
of
a single
species
fluid
is heated
into
a single
phase
a complex
transport
and interfacial
processes
occurs
in the two-phase
fluid.
This process,
that
is often
called
boiling,
is important
in many
applications
because
of the large
heat
transfer
that
it
facilitates.
In the weightless
environment
of an orbiting
space
craft,
the buoyancy
force
and all of the complications
it causes
is negligable.
The perfect
wetting
by the liquid
phase
(zero
contact-angle)
near
the critical
temperature,
To, will be replaced
by liquid-gas-solid
contact
lines
with a zero
degree
contact
angle
when
a wetted
wall
dries
from
evaporation.
In this presentation,
we also
report
on the behavior
of a single
bubble
in a thin
constant
mass
cell in several
experiments
where
the cells
are filled
with
fluid
very
close
to the liquid-gas
critical
density
and heated.
These
thin
cells
produce
a considerable
constraint
on the bubble
and
allow
the entire
bubble
to be observed
as the heat is applied.
Our experiments
have recorded
two
types
of behavior
depending
on the initial
conditions
and the constraints
on the bubble.
The first
behavior
is characterized
by vigorous
gas spreading
over
much
of the heating
copper
side-wall
near
To, when
the system's
temperature,
T, is increased
at a constant
rate
past
To. This behavior
occurs
when
the bubble
is free
to move
in the cell
and
is initially
in contact
with
the highly
conductive
side-wall.
We identify
this behavior
with the boiling
crisis
near
the critical
point,
i.e.,
a reaction
of the fluid to the heating
surface
where
the heating
surface
becomes
covered
with
gas.
A likely
mechanism
for this
spreading
is revealed
near
the
critical
point
by an analysis
of the
critical
anomalies:
the vapor
recoil
from
evaporating
fluid
pushes
the fluid
near
the liquid-gas-
solid
contact
line at the edge of the bubble.
No
gas bubble
spreading
is observed
in the
second
type
of behavior
that
occurs
when
a
piston
and temperature
sensors,
present
inside
of the cell, prevent
the bubble
from
moving
and
touching
the side-wall.
This
case
did
reveal
that
as the liquid-gas
mixture
is heated
toward
the
critical
point,
gas phase
over-heating
is observed.
Previously
this
gas phase
over-heating
was
only
observed
when
the
temperature
was
quenched
in a thick
cell.
Here,
we
have
observed
overheating
in a thin cell
when
the temperature
is ramped.
More
interestingly,
this
over-heating
effect
persists
and increases
when
the temperature
is ramped
into
the
single-phase
supercritical
fluid
state,
where
the liquid
becomes
high-density
fluid
and the gas become
low-density
fluid.
In both
cases
large
distortions
in
the
liquid
wetting
layer
inside
the
bubble
is
also
observed
at lower
T. The film distortions
were
sometimes
continuous,
appearing
to be similar
to
a refracting
(converging)
lens.
By ray
tracing
the shadow
of a defocused
grid
through
the cell
and the film,
we modeled
this film
shape
as an ellipse.
This
showed
that
these
films
were
much
thicker
than
films
typically
found
on Earth,
by more
than
an order
of magnitude.
This
large
film
thickness
allows
an explanation
of the
over-heating
in this
thin
cell
that
is consistent
with
a
previous
explanation
for thick cells.
Other
film structures
appear
as lines of almost
discontinuous
film thickness
changes
that propagate
away
from
the bubble's
edge into the bubble.
We conclude
that these
are spreading
contact
lines.
These
spreading
contact
lines
are usually
observed
near
the
region
where
the bubble
touches
the
copper
side-wall
and they
are
also
highly
correlated
with
cell heating
events.
The
zero
contact-angle
for these
contact
lines
implies
that
an external
stress
is applied
to create
a large
curvature
change
at these
lines.
Once
again
the vapor-recoil
force
is a
good
candidate
for the cause
of this additional
stress.

ABSTRACT
An experiment
to study
stratified
Taylor-Couette
flow
with
radial,
or cross-stream,
gravity
is
being
developed.
The
experiment
uses
ferromagnetic
fluid
(ferrofluid)
and
a unique
stacked-
magnet
configuration
to generate
a strong
(3 to 10 g) radial
gravity
field.
In the microgravity
environment
this
experiment
will
permit
laboratory
study
of
a
wide
range
of
stability,
transitional,
and turbulent
flow problems
in a simple
re-entrant
geometry.
Important
fundamental
situations
that
can be implemented
include
thermal
convection
in a "vertical"
shear
flow,
stably
stratified
shear
flows,
and stably
or unstably
stratified
centrifugal
(spiral)
instabilities.
Figure
1
(below)
shows
a sketch
of the experiment,
which
also illustrates
the basic-state
flows
expected
in
the terrestrial
laboratory.
The linear
stability
problem
for an axially
and azimuthally
invariant
mean
flow
consisting
of
the exact
analytically
determined
fields
V
=
[0,
Vm(r),Wm(r)],
T=
Tm(r)
has been
solved
numerically
for the terrestrial
case
with
both
ge and
gm( r ) present,
and for the
microgravity
case
where
ge is negligible.
Modifications
to the usual
Taylor-Couette
modes
are
found,
along
with new disturbance
modes
arising
from
the radial
magnetic
gravity.
In
order
to carry
out
meaningful
experiments
with
this
system,
an
effective
visualization
method
for the opaque
ferrofluid
is required.
Ultrasonic
Doppler
Velocimetry
has been
used
to
measure
the
velocity
distributions
in
ferrofluid
for
a simple
mechanically
forced
un-heated
configuration.
The experimental
results
are in good
agreement
with direct
numerical
simulations
of the axisymmetric
(2D)
steady
flow,
suggesting
that UDV
is a very promising
tool for studying
circulations
in this medium.
Other
issues,
such
as
determining
the
significance
of
non-Newtonian
fluid
effects,
and
predicting
the nature
of motions
driven
directly
by magnet
field
imperfections
(in
height),
have
been
studied
theoretically,
and will be summarized
as time permits.

AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
INCOMPRESSIBLE
RICHTMYER-MESHKOV
INSTABILITY

ABSTRACT
Richtmyer-Meshkov
(RM)
instability
occurs
when
two
different
density
fluids
are
impulsively
accelerated
in the direction
normal
to their
nearly
planar
interface.
The
instability
causes
small
perturbations
on the interface
to grow
and eventually
become
a turbulent
flow.
It is
closely
related
to
Rayleigh-Taylor
instability,
which
is
the
instability
of
a planar
interface
undergoing
constant
acceleration,
such
as caused
by the suspension
of a heavy
fluid over
a lighter
one
in the
earth's
gravitational
field.
Like
the
well-known
Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability,
RM
instability
is
a fundamental
hydrodynamic
instability
which
exhibits
many
of
the
nonlinear
complexities
that transform
simple
initial
conditions
into a complex
turbulent
flow.
Furthermore,
the simplicity
of RM
instability
(in that
it requires
very
few
defining
parameters),
and
the fact
that
it can be
generated
in a closed
container,
makes
it an excellent
test
bed
to study
nonlinear
stability
theory
as well
as turbulent
transport
in a heterogeneous
system.
However,
the fact
that
RM
instability
involves
fluids
of unequal
densities
which
experience
negligible
gravitational
force,
except
during
the impulsive
acceleration,
requires
RM instability
experiments
to be carried
out under
conditions
ofmicrogravity.
This
experimental
study
investigates
the instability
of an interface
between
incompressible,
miscible
liquids
with
an initial
sinusoidal
perturbation.
The impulsive
acceleration
is generated
by bouncing
a rectangular
tank
containing
two
different
density
liquids
off a retractable
vertical
spring.
The
initial
perturbation
is produced
prior
to
release
by
oscillating
the
tank
in
the
horizontal
direction
to produce
a standing
wave.
The instability
evolves
in microgravity
as the
tank
travels
up and then
down
the vertical
rails
of a drop
tower
until
hitting
a shock
absorber
at
the bottom.
Planar
Laser
Induced
Fluorescence
(PLIF)
is employed
to visualize
the flow.
PLIF
images
are captured
by
a video
camera
that
travels
with
the
tank.
Figure
1 is as sequence
of
images
showing
the development
of the instability
from
the initial
sinusoidal
disturbance
far into
the nonlinear
regime
which
is characterized
by the appearance
of mushroom
structures
resulting
from
the
coalescence
of baroclinic
vorticity
produced
by the
impulsive
acceleration.
At later
times
in this sequence
the vortex
cores
are observed
to become
unstable
showing
the beginnings
of the transition
to turbulence
in this flow.
The
amplitude
of the growing
disturbance
after
the
impulsive
acceleration
is measured
and
found
to agree
well
with
theoretical
predictions.
The
effects
of Reynolds
number
(based
on circulation)
on the development
of the vortices
and the
transition
to turbulence
are also
determined.

THE
USE
OF
PULSATILE
FLOW
TO
SEPARATE
SPECIES

ABSTRACT
The
removal
of carbon
dioxide
from
air is important
in producing
a habitable
environment
for the self-supporting
space
stations
of the space program.
Pulsatile
flow
is a novel
way to help
in the partial
separation
of different
species
from
air by using
a purely
mechanical
method.
The
advantage
of this is that
no chemicals
are needed.
Pulsatile
flow
also
has the advantage
that
it
can
handle
large
volumes.
While
it is not
expected
that
this
process
will
replace
existing
methods
of separation,
it can surely
be used
as a means
to assist
in the overall
separation
process,
possibly
as a precursor
to conventional
methods.
This
work
specifically
focuses
on the physics
of pulsatile
flow
and its
effect
on the mass
transfer
of species
and the
separation
that
can
be
achieved.
From
the theoretical
model
that
predicts
the mass
transfer
and separation
of species,
we
provide
a physical
explanation
of
the phenomena
predicted
by
the
models.
If two
dilute
species
are present
in a carrier,
the mass
transfer
of the faster
diffusing
species
may
be higher,
lower,
or the same
as the slow
diffusing
species.
This
depends
on the time
constants
associated
with
the system
and the ability
of a species
to remain
in the fast moving
portion
of the flow
field.
The difference
in the mass
transfer
of each
species
can lead
to a separation
that
can be used
in a
number
of processes
including
the removal
of carbon
dioxide
from
the air.
This phenomenon
is
modeled
in an open
tube
geometry
and
in the annular
space
between
two
concentric
cylinders.
Further,
in annular
pulsatile
flow,
the effect
of the inner
cylinder
being
off center
from
the outer
cylinder
on the mass
transfer
and separation
is also
analyzed.
Experiments
were
also conducted
to verify
the validity
of the models
and the viability
ofpulsatile
flows
as a separations
procedure.
PHYSICS
OF THE
FLUID
FLOW--MASS
TRANSPORT
INTERACTION
Picture
a tube
with
a gas occupying
a reservoir
at each
end.
One of the reservoirs
can be
considered
to hold
a pure
gas called
the carrier
while
the other
is a mixture
of the carrier
gas with
a dilute
amount
of a single
species
as shown
in Fig.
1 According
to Fick's
law for dilute
species,
the
non-interacting
particles
will
move
from
the
mixture
to the
carrier
gas
from
high
to low
concentration
in a process
involving
pure
molecular
diffusion.
Now,
suppose
that the fluid in the
tube
oscillates
with
no net
flow
from
one
reservoir
to the
other.
This,
for
example,
can
be
achieved
with
a piston.
In the first
half
of a cycle
of the piston
stroke,
a nearly
parabolic
flow
profile
is produced
in the tube,
provided
that the frequency
is not large.
This in turn causes
radial
concentration
gradients.
The
dilute
species
then
diffuses
from
the
core
of the
tube
to the
NASA/T_2002-211211
275

boundary.
In the second
half
of a cycle,
the flow profile
is reversed
and the species
moves
from
the boundary
to the core
where
the concentration
of the species
is small
compared
to itw value
at
the boundary.
In the first half
of the next
cycle
of the piston
stroke,
the species
that is in the fast
moving
core
of the tube is convected
down
the tube and again
radially
diffuses

towards
the wall
of the tube.
The species
thus proceeds
to move
in this zigzag
fashion
down
the
tube
giving
a higher
transport
of it than
by pure
molecular
diffusion,
yet
with
no
net
flow
between
the two
reservoirs.
If another
non-interacting
dilute
species
were
added
to the mixture,
the time constants
of the system
become
very important
due to the differing
diffusion
coefficients
of
the
species,
the
frequency
of
oscillation,
and
the
kinematic
viscosity
of the
fluid.
These
different
time
constants
can give
rise to a separation
of species
due to the periodic
flow.
It is the
relationship
of the different
time constants
that
govern
the mass
transfer
for each
species
as well
as an analysis
of the mass
transfer
and separation
of species
for different
geometries
that
are the
focus
of this research.

ABSTRACT
Efficient
fluid
reclamation
is a critical
technology
for
manned
space
exploration.
Centrifugal
filtration,
where
non-colloidal
particles
are deposited
on filter
fibers
due to inertial
impaction
or
direct
interception,
is
a promising
candidate
for
mechanical
separation
in
variable
gravity
environments.
Understanding
how
fluid
inertia
characterized
by shear-based
Reynolds
number
affects
deposition
is therefore
critical
in designing
fluid
reclamation
systems
for
microgravity
environments.
This
work
will
develop
"particle
proximity
sensors,"
or
non-intrusive
optical
diagnostic
techniques
for
directly
visualizing
where
and
when
non-colloidal
particles
deposit
upon,
or
contact,
solid
surfaces.
Essentially,
any particle
near
the surface
will
scatter
light
at a different
wavelength
from
that
scattered
by particles
in the
bulk
suspension.
The
particles
next
to the
surface
can
then
be
easily
isolated
using
a wavelength
filter.
The
technique
exploits
the
pH
sensitivity
of fluorophores
and uses
an applied
electric
potential
to create
a pH gradient
next
to
the surface
of interest.
The
particle
proximity
sensors
require
aqueous
chemistries.
We have
therefore
developed
and
characterized
a new
aqueous
model
suspension
system
of polymethyl
methacrylate
(PMMA)
particles
suspended
in a ternary
mixture
of the salt ammonium
thiocyanate
(NH4SCN),
water
and
glycerin.
The
model
suspension
has
a refractive
index
n = 1.4867,
a density
P = 1.19
g/cm 3, a
viscosity
g = 4.99
cP at 22°C--giving
a kinematic
viscous
four times
that of water--and
a pH of
4.5.
Transmission
measurements
using
both
polydisperse
and
nearly
monodisperse
PMMA
particles
(diameters
ranging
from
106-212
gm
and
75-90
gm,
respectively)
show
that
a 5%
volume
fraction
suspension
has
an optical
transmission
through
1 cm of suspension
that
is 80%
1
of that for the same
solution
without
particles
at 22.5°C
when
illuminated
at 488
and 514.5
nm.
The optical
transmission
of this
suspension
is comparable
to that
of a suspension
system
used
by
other
researchers
for laser-Doppler
velocimetry
studies 2.
This
aqueous
system
is less hazardous
than
previous
model
systems
based
on organic
solvents
and halogenated
hydrocarbons.
It is,
with
its
relatively
low
viscosity,
also
useful
for
higher
Reynolds
number
studies,
including
turbulent
suspension
flows.

A weak

creating

results
characterizing
the effect
of a solid

We plan
to also use particle
proximity
sensors
to study
inertial
particle
impaction
upon
a single
filter
fiber
in centrifugal
filtration,
or a cylinder
immersed
in a simply
sheared
suspension•
To
this end,
a plane
Couette
suspension
flow
facility
to study
simply
sheared
suspensions
has been
designed
and
built•
Based
upon
a previously
used
apparatus
for
single-phase
Newtonian
fluid
studies,
the
facility
uses
an endless
belt
stretched
over
and
driven
by two
large
rollers
and
a
contraction
at both
ends
of the test
section
to minimize
end effects•
The
temperature-controlled
suspension
is confined
inside
the belt
by a layer
of heavy
immiscible
fluid
at the bottom
of the
test
section•
Preliminary
results
on the rotation
rate
of a circular
cylinder
immersed
in a simply
sheared
suspension
in
this
new
facility
at
various
shear-based
Reynolds
number
will
be
presented
and
compared
with
previous
numerical
and
experimental
results
for
a
cylinder
immersed
in a single-phase
fluid•
This
ground-based
project
is
a
first
step
towards
"heavy"
and
"light"
suspension
flow
experiments
in microgravity.
Considering
the current
limitations
of computational
techniques
in
non-Stokesian,
many-particle
suspension
simulations
and
our inability
to decouple
inertial
and
buoyancy
effects
upon
Earth,
microgravity
environments
present
a unique
opportunity
to isolate
and study
the effects
of differential
particle-fluid
inertia.
In addition,
particle
proximity
sensors
could
be
a valuable
diagnostic
technique
in
studying
several
multiphase
flow
problems
of
importance
in
manned
space
exploration,
such
as
dust
deposition
on

ABSTRACT
Linear
stability
analysis
of a horizontal
double-diffusive
layer
under
gravity
modulation
is
performed.
The steady
part
of the gravity
is in the vertical
direction
while
the oscillating
part
of
the
gravity
is arbitrary.
In the
absence
of
gravity
modulation,
two
modes
of instabilities
are
possible,
they
are steady
finger
and oscillatory
diffusive
modes.
The gravity
modulation
excites
synchronous
and quasi-periodic
modes
in the case
of steady
finger
convection.
In the oscillatory
diffusive
case,
synchronous,
quasi-periodic
and subharmonic
modes
are found.
We
consider
a horizontal
fluid
layer
of thickness
D
stratified
by
a stable
constant
solute
gradient
characterized
nondimensionally
by
the
solute
Rayleigh
number
Rs = goflASD3/_v
in
which
fl = p-lOp/aS,
_cand v
are thermal
diffusivity
and kinematic
viscosity
of the fluid,
AS is
the difference
in solute
concentration
across
the layer
maintained
constant
by the rigid
diffusive
upper
and
lower
boundaries,
and
go
is
the
steady
gravity
field.
The
lower
boundary
is
maintained
at a temperature
Air higher
than
that
of the upper
boundary.
Instability
occurs
when
the
thermal
Rayleigh
number
R r =goakYD3/l_'v
in
which
a=-p-lop/Oyexceeds
its
critical
value.
Under
steady
gravity,
the
instability
onsets
in the
oscillatory
mode
and
the
oscillation
frequency,
or,
depends
on
the
wave
number
of the
perturbation.
Now,
if the
fluid
layer
is
subjected
to gravity
modulation
in the form
g = go fc +gl cos(t)t)O.
Resonance
may
occur
when
fl is some
multiple
of or. Such resonance
effects
are the focus
of our investigation.
Also
k is the
unit vector
in the vertical
direction
and
_ is the unit vector
of the oscillating
gravity
direction.
We investigate
the linear
stability
of such
a system
under
gravity
modulation
based
on the set
of equations
derived
by Terrones
and Chen
(1993).
The method
of analysis
according
to Floquet
theory
is carried
out with
a double
series
expansion,
Galerkin
and Chebyshev,
as used
by Chen
and Chen
(1999)
for convection
in a vertical
slot under
gravity
modulation.
Numerical
results
are
obtained
for a liquid
metal
with
Pr = 0.01,
Le = 3333,
gl/go
= 0.2,
and an initial
Rs -- -3200
[one
of the examples
given
by Terrones
and Chen
(1993)].
Three
modes,
synchronous,
quasi-periodic
and
subharmonic,
were
excited
by gravity
modulation.
The
subharmonic
mode
corresponds
to
the
resonance
and
has
the
most
destabilizing
effect.
The
critical
Rayleigh
number
versus
modulation
frequency
for
different
directions
of the oscillating
part
of the
gravity
is shown
in
Figure
1.
The
resonance
effect
is found
to be
increasing
with
angle
(0
= 0 corresponds
to
horizontal
and
90 ° means
vertical).
The maximum
reduction
in the critical
thermal
Rayleigh
is
86%.

Curve
vs Modulation
Frequency
We
also
investigate
the
effect
of gravity
modulation
on
the steady
finger
instability
case.
Only
synchronous
and quasi-periodic
modes
exist.
The results
presented
in Figure
2 corresponds
to Pr = 7 Le = 100
gl/go
=0.4,
and
an initial
Rs =100.
The
gravity
modulation
has
a small
destabilizing
effect
on the onset
of steady
finger
convection.
Figure
2.
Critical
Rayleigh
Number
versus
Modulation
Frequency
In
this
investigation,
we
found
that
resonance
occurs
only
in
the
diffusive
regime
with
modulation
frequency
being
approximately
twice
the natural
frequency.
The
destabilizing
effect
is most
pronounced
when
the gravity
modulation
is in the same
direction
of the steady
gravity
vector.
In the finger
convection
regime,
gravity
modulation
causes
slight
destabilizing
effect
at
low modulation
frequencies.
