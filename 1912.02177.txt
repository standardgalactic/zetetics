Abstract:
The classical double copy relates solutions to the equations of motion in gauge theory and in
gravity. In this paper, we present two double-copy formalisms for relating the Coulomb solution in
gauge theory to the two-parameter Janis-Newman-Winicour solution in gravity. The latter is a static,
spherically symmetric, asymptotically ﬂat solution that generically includes a dilaton ﬁeld, but also
admits the Schwarzschild solution as a special case. We ﬁrst present the classical double copy as a
perturbative construction, similar to its formulation for scattering amplitudes, and then present it as
an exact map, with a novel generalisation of the Kerr-Schild double copy motivated by double ﬁeld
theory. The latter formalism exhibits the relation between the Kerr-Schild classical double copy and
the string theory origin of the double copy for scattering amplitudes.

Introduction
The double copy is a relation between gauge theory and gravity, which originated in the structure of
scattering amplitudes in these theories. It was ﬁrst noticed in the context of string theory [1], and was
later explored for the calculation of scattering amplitudes in gravity theories [2, 3], where it became a
formidable tool. See ref. [4] for a recent review.
The intuitive idea of the double copy is that calculations for spin-2 particles are somehow ‘factoris-
able’ into calculations for spin-1 particles. If we think in terms of the representations of the Lorentz
group for massless particles, however, we notice imediately that the tensor product of spin-1 states
leads to more than spin-2 states. Take the basis of positive and negative helicities {ϵ+
µ , ϵ−
µ } for spin-1
states in four dimensions. Then the ‘product-gravity’ states are {ϵ+
µ ϵ+
ν , ϵ−
µ ϵ−
ν , ϵ+
µ ϵ−
ν , ϵ−
µ ϵ+
ν }, the ﬁrst
two of which are graviton states of positive and negative helicities. The two extra states correspond
to a scalar (dilaton) and a pseudo-scalar (axion): the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations,
respectively. This four-dimensional argument has a natural extension to any number of spacetime
dimensions (with the axion substituted by the more general B-ﬁeld), as we shall discuss. From these
considerations, we see that the double copy of gauge theory will generically involve these additional
ﬁelds, not just the graviton. The non-vacuum gravity solution under study in this paper, the Janis-
Newman-Winicour solution, will provide a simple example of the inclusion of an additional ﬁeld —
the dilaton.
Interactions in the ‘product-gravity’ theory arise via the double copy from interactions in Yang-
Mills theory, after stripping oﬀthe colour dependence of the latter in an appropriate manner. The
– 1 –

rules of the double copy for scattering amplitudes provide a prescription for this. One question that has
motivated much recent work is how to extend these ideas beyond scattering amplitudes, in particular
to solutions of the classical equations of motion. The translation into this new setting is not trivial, and
there are three obvious reasons for this. The ﬁrst reason is that the solutions are typically expressed in
coordinate space, rather than in momentum space, which is used for scattering amplitudes. The second
reason is that scattering amplitudes exhibit gauge invariance, whereas explicit formulas for solutions
depend on gauge choices. The third reason is that scattering amplitudes are studied in perturbation
theory, and the rules of the double copy apply separately at each perturbative order. It is not clear a
priori whether an exact solution in gravity can be expressed in a simple manner as a double copy of
a gauge-theory solution.
Despite these diﬃculties, there is deﬁnite progress in relating exact solutions in gravity and gauge
theory via the double copy. This is possible for a class of vacuum solutions in gravity, that of stationary
Kerr-Schild spacetimes [5], where much work has been done in this context; see e.g. [6–21]. The
basic example is the relation of the Schwarzschild and Coulomb solutions. More generally (in four
dimensions), it applies to vacuum type-D spacetimes [15], relating, for instance, the C-metric to an
analogous Lienard-Wiechert potential. These cases involve vacuum spacetimes, and yet we argued
above that, more generally, the double copy should involve the dilaton and the B-ﬁeld. An extension
of the Kerr-Schild class of solutions that is well suited to deal with these ﬁelds was proposed in
[22], based on the formalism of double ﬁeld theory [23–28]. Several examples were considered with
non-trivial conﬁgurations for the dilaton and the B-ﬁeld.
We will review and further extend this
construction below. An extension to ‘heterotic gravity’ was also given a double-copy interpretation
[29]. These developments clearly demonstrate that the ‘double’ in double copy and double ﬁeld theory
is indeed related; see [30, 31] for earlier insights. Moreover, the double ﬁeld theory approach explicitly
relates the left-/right-moving factorisation associated to string theory, which is at the origin of the
double copy, to the Kerr-Schild ansatz.
The progress in understanding solutions with dilaton and B-ﬁeld raises a natural question. It has
been argued that the double copy of a point charge (Coulomb) is not simply Schwarzschild, which is
the example from the original Kerr-Schild double copy; it is an asymptotically-ﬂat, static, spherically-
symmetric solution containing a dilaton ﬁeld [32, 33]. Ref. [33] further argued that the double copy
may be naturally deﬁned to admit the dilaton or not, i.e., that it is not unique. The general double
copy of a point charge was identiﬁed as the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) solution [34]. The latter
possesses two parameters, one associated to the graviton ﬁeld and the other associated to the dilaton;
the particular case of vanishing dilaton is the Schwarzschild solution. Here, we will present further
arguments for why the double copy of a point charge is the full Janis-Newman-Winicour solution. Not
only will we generalise the perturbative analysis of ref. [33], but we will actually present an exact map
between the JNW solution and the Coulomb solution, along the lines of the Kerr-Schild double copy.
This will involve extending the Kerr-Schild ansatz in double ﬁeld theory, beyond the class of solutions
considered in [22].
One apparent puzzle is that the ‘single-copy’ gauge-theory solutions that are associated to the
examples above are all Abelian. They trivialise the colour dependence. The solution to this puzzle
is that many non-trivial gravity solutions (such as Schwarzschild or Kerr) are eﬀectively linear, as is
manifestly the case if they are of Kerr-Schild type. In fact, if we can write down an exact solution
to the Einstein equations with a ﬁnite number of independent parameters, that solution should be
‘linear’ in each parameter, in some sense. In this paper, we will see that this applies also to a solution,
JNW, that deviates considerably from the Kerr-Schild property.
It is striking that a double-copy map between certain exact solutions, as explored here, is possible
– 2 –

at all. Generically, the expected setting for the classical double copy is perturbative. This is how most
discussions of the double copy for classical solutions have proceeded: the ﬁrst approaches [35–37],
constructions based on the local symmetries [33, 38–42], use of the worldline formalism [32, 43–52],
and perturbation theory on curved backgrounds [53, 54].
A double copy for classical observables
(rather than solutions to the equations of motion) that follows more directly from that of scattering
amplitudes has been explored with a view to gravitational phenomenology [55–71], a subject of obvious
interest following the discovery of gravitational waves.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 contains a brief review and an overview of the paper.
In section 3, we use a perturbative construction to interpret the JNW solution as a double copy. In
section 4, we use an exact construction to interpret the JNW solution as a double copy, based on the
formalism of double ﬁeld theory. We conclude with a discussion of future directions in section 5.

Double-copy construction
In the ﬁrst part of this section, we present an overview of the double-copy construction, leaving
greater detail for later sections. In the second part of this section, we review the JNW spacetime,
whose double-copy relation to a point charge is the focus of our paper.
2.1
Basics
The starting point for the double copy is the tensor product structure between asymptotic states of
perturbative scattering in Yang-Mills theory (stripped of colour) and gravity. The simplest example
relates a product of polarisation vectors ϵµ and ˜ϵν to a polarisation tensor εµν,
εµν = ϵµ ˜ϵν .
(2.1)
Since the polarisation vectors span a (D −2)-dimensional space, they induce a (D −2)2-dimensional
basis for the (generically non-factorisable) polarisation tensors in gravity. This gravity theory contains
not only the graviton, but also an antisymmetric two-form ﬁeld (B-ﬁeld) and a scalar ﬁeld (dilaton).
The decomposition into these component ﬁelds can be written as
εµν = ε(h)
µν + ε(B)
µν + ε(φ)
µν ,
(2.2)
with
ε(h)
µν = ε(µν) −∆µν
d −2 ελ

ε(B)
µν = ε[µν] ,

(2.4)
The low-energy interactions between the asymptotic states are basically ﬁxed by gauge invariance, in
both Yang-Mills theory and gravity. In the gravity case, the relevant theory (containing the dilaton
and the B-ﬁeld) is sometimes called NS-NS gravity, due to its appearance in the zero-mass level of
the closed string, or alternatively N = 0 supergravity. We shall discuss it further below. Remarkably,
a factorisation reminiscent of (2.1) exists for the full (interacting) theories, which follows from the
relation between open and closed strings. In the context of scattering amplitudes A, the double copy
can be expressed in diﬀerent formalisms, but we may schematically represent it as
A NS-NS-grav(ϵ i
µ˜ϵ i
ν) = AYM(ϵ i
µ) ⊗dc AYM(˜ϵ i
µ) .
(2.5)
– 3 –

That is, the scattering amplitudes in gravity are given as a double copy of those in gauge theory. The
‘double-copy product’ ⊗dc involves inverse propagators and, of course, the stripping oﬀof the colour
dependence in the gauge theory amplitudes.
The remarks above have a coordinate-space analogue, where the double copy of Yang-Mills ﬁelds
Aa
µ and ˜Aa
µ leads to a gravity ﬁeld Hµν, dubbed the ‘fat graviton’, with (D −2)2 degrees of freedom
[33]. In this construction, to be reviewed in detail in section 3.1, the linearised ‘fat graviton’ has a
decomposition in terms of graviton, B-ﬁeld and dilaton, analogous to (2.2). In particular,
Hµν = hµν + Bµν + P q
µν(φ −h) ,
(2.6)
where P q
µν is a coordinate-space version of ∆µν/(D −2). To go beyond the free theory, one needs only
the double copy. In particular, a Lagrangian for Hµν can be constructed order by order in perturbation
theory so as to obey the double copy for the scattering amplitudes (2.5). The three-point interaction
is explicitly discussed in section 3.2, for instance. Starting from a solution to the linearised theory, we
can correct the solution order by order using those interactions. In suﬃciently symmetric cases, one
may be able to resum the perturbative solution, thereby obtaining an exact solution.
With this reasoning, the classical double copy is determined once we have the linearised classical
double copy (at least for solutions that are continuously connected to the trivial solution). Consider
the Coulomb solution in Yang-Mills theory,
Aa
µ = −ca
r uµ ,
(2.7)
where uµ = (−1, 0, 0, 0) and ∂µca = 0. The latter condition linearises the Yang-Mills equations, and
therefore the solution is both linearised and exact. We may therefore substitute ca by a Maxwell
electric charge. The question is now what is its double copy. A natural guess is1
Hµν = κ M
8π r uµuν ,
(2.8)
which solves the linearised equations of motion. Notice that the B-ﬁeld vanishes as Hµν is symmetric.
Given that this is a static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically ﬂat solution to the Einstein
equations with a minimally-coupled scalar ﬁeld (the dilaton), the exact solution is unique and known
explicitly. It is the JNW solution, to be reviewed in the next subsection. This solution possesses two
parameters, M and Y , which are associated respectively to the graviton ﬁeld and the dilaton. The
case above corresponds to the solution with M = Y . The double-copy interpretation of this solution
was also discussed in [32], based on a worldline formalism for constructing solutions. For reference,
the ‘fat graviton’ ﬁeld (at linearised level) for the JNW solution can be written as
Hµν = κ


M uµuν + (M −Y ) 1


,
(2.9)
where qµ = (1, 0, 0, 1) and lµ = (0, x, y, r + z)/(r + z) [33].
There is another natural guess for the double copy of the point charge, though — the Schwarzschild
solution. Suppose that we write the Coulomb solution in a diﬀerent gauge,
A′a
µ = −ca
r kµ ,
(2.10)
1We will deﬁne later our normalisation conventions.
– 4 –

where kµ = (1, x/r). Then a natural guess for the corresponding metric is
gµν = ηµν + κ2M
8π r kµkν .
(2.11)
This turns out to be the Schwarzschild solution in Kerr-Schild coordinates. So now we have a vacuum
solution, i.e., no dilaton. Indeed, the Schwarzschild solution is a particular case of the JNW solution,
the one where Y = 0. The metric exhibits in Kerr-Schild coordinates the property that it is both
linearised and exact. This property was instrumental in interpreting the exact solution as the double
copy of a point charge in [5], and this conclusion extends to many other cases, including the Kerr
and Taub-NUT metrics — in fact, it extends to all vacuum type D spacetimes [15]. This double-copy
interpretation is further supported by more recent arguments involving solution-generating techniques,
computations with scattering amplitudes, duality considerations, and asymptotic symmetries [20, 64,
66, 69, 72]. Notice that, in terms of the ‘fat graviton’ (2.9), the Schwarzschild case (Y = 0) does not
look particularly simple.
Each of the examples looks more natural for certain coordinates or ﬁeld choices. They are also
consistent with the linearised double-copy ideas developed in [38–41].2 We argue, following [33], that
the general JNW solution should be interpreted as the double copy of a point charge. In fact, we will
ﬁnd in this paper an exact double-copy map from the JNW solution to the Coulomb solution, along the
lines of the Kerr-Schild double copy (even though the solution is not of Kerr-Schild type). Of the two
parameters of the JNW solution, M and Y , only a combination survives in the ‘single copy’, associated
to the charge parameter of the Coulomb solution. Logically, the reverse path — from Coulomb to
JNW — must allow for the introduction of an additional parameter, which distinguishes M and Y ,
as argued above.
From our initial considerations with polarisation vectors and tensors, the analogue statement is
that, with a pair of polarisation tensors ϵµ and ˜ϵµ, it is natural to consider diﬀerent tensorial structures
for the ‘product’, namely ϵ(µ˜ϵν), ϵ[µ˜ϵν], and also ∆µν ϵ · ˜ϵ. With a single polarisation vector in hand,
say ϵµ, the most general double copy is the combination
C(h)

ϵµϵν −∆µν
d −2 ϵ · ϵ

+ C(φ) ∆µν
d −2 ϵ · ϵ ,
(2.12)
where C(h) and C(φ) are the two parameters. This is the analogue of the JNW solution. With two
distinct polarisation tensors, ϵµ and ˜ϵµ, it is also natural to tune the B-ﬁeld component.
2.2
The JNW solution
We are interested in a static, spherically symmetric solution ﬁrst obtained by Janis, Newman and
Winicour (JNW) [34]. This solution to the Einstein equations with a minimally-coupled scalar reads

2This is based on a convolution with a certain scalar ﬁeld, related to the bi-adjoint scalar. With spherical symmetry,
the procedure roughly amounts to 1/r = (1/r) ∗inv(1/r) ∗(1/r), where, on the right-hand side, the ﬁrst and third
factors come from the pair of Coulomb solutions, and in the middle factor “inv” denotes an inverse with respect to the
convolution ∗. This justiﬁes the fact that the exact classical double copy works locally in coordinate space for a special
class of solutions (and gauges), whereas in general one expects the double copy to work locally only in momentum space.

(2.15)
The special case for which Y = 0 and M > 0 (and therefore γ = 1) is the Schwarzschild solution. If
M > 0 but the dilaton ﬁeld is non-vanishing, i.e., |Y | > 0, then the solution is still asymptotically ﬂat,
but there is a naked singularity at zero radius, which corresponds to ρ = ρ0 since the 2-sphere factor
vanishes in the line element. This naked singularity is not surprising because the uniqueness theorems
prevent a scalar-hair deformation of the Schwarzschild solution.
The JNW solution is a natural point charge solution in the double-copy gravity theory, i.e., NS-NS
gravity, so it is not surprising that it is related to the Coulomb solution. In the exact double-copy
construction of section 4, we will ﬁnd that, for any solution to NS-NS gravity that respects a certain
Kerr-Schild-inspired ansatz, there are two corresponding solutions to the Maxwell equations,
Rµν = 0
⇒
∂µFµν = 0 ,
∂µ ¯Fµν = 0 .
(2.16)
Here, Rµν is a double ﬁeld theory analogue of Rµν for vacuum gravity. The Maxwell solutions with
ﬁeld strength Fµν and ¯Fµν are the pair whose double copy is the NS-NS gravity solution, and they
are associated respectively to left and right movers from a string theory interpretation. For the JNW
solution, Fµν = ¯Fµν, and they correspond to Coulomb. In the vacuum case, where JNW reduces to
Schwarzschild, this coincides with the original Kerr-Schild double copy.

Perturbative double copy
In this section, we follow a perturbative construction of the classical double copy presented in [33].
In that work, this construction was illustrated by a particular case of the JNW family, with M = Y ,
for which the calculations are easier. The aim of this section is to apply the construction to a generic
JNW solution, with M ̸= Y . Below, we review the formalism and its application to the linearised
JNW solution, before studying the next order in perturbation theory.
3.1
Linear level: review
The basic object in the construction of Ref. [33] is the gravity ﬁeld that naturally arises as the double
copy of Yang-Mills theory, denoted by Hµν, which was dubbed the ‘fat graviton’.
This ﬁeld is a
massless tensor with (D −2)2 degrees of freedom. It provides an alternative formulation, at least in
perturbation theory, to Einstein gravity coupled to a dilaton ﬁeld φ and a two-form ﬁeld Bµν. The
latter is known as B-ﬁeld or Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld in the context of string theory, where this gravity
theory arises in the low energy limit of the closed bosonic string. The action is

where (dB)µνλ is the ﬁeld strength for Bµν.
We use a particular normalisation of the ﬁelds that
simpliﬁes some of the constant coeﬃcients that appear in the perturbation theory. The ﬁeld associated
to the metric may be expressed as the ‘gothic graviton’ hµν via3
√−g gµν = ηµν −κ hµν ,
(3.2)
3At linearised level, this coincides with the ‘trace-reversed graviton’, hµν = hµν −1
2 ηµνh , where hµν is the usual
metric perturbation and h is its trace.
– 6 –

for which the de Donder gauge is simply given by ∂µhµν = 0 . Following [33], we refer to hµν, φ and
Bµν as the ‘skinny ﬁelds’, in contrast to the representation of the full content of these ﬁelds in terms
of the ‘fat graviton’ Hµν. Together, the ‘skinny ﬁelds’ have (D −2)2 perturbative degrees of freedom,
the same as the ‘fat graviton’.
Let us recall how this dictionary works at linearised level. Consider the de Donder gauge for the
graviton ﬁeld, and a Lorentz-type gauge for the B-ﬁeld, ∂µBµν = 0. Then the linearised equations of
motion for the ‘skinny ﬁelds’ are simply
∂2hµν = 0 ,
∂2φ = 0 ,
∂2Bµν = 0 .
(3.3)
The ‘fat graviton’ is deﬁned, at linearised level, as
Hµν = hµν + Bµν + P q
µν(φ −h) ,
(3.4)
where h = ηµνhµν and P q
µν is a coordinate-space realisation of a momentum-space projector, which
we will deﬁne momentarily.
The ‘fat graviton’ is deﬁned in this way so that it satisﬁes both the
Lorentz-type condition ∂µHµν = 0 and the equation of motion
∂2Hµν = 0 .
(3.5)
Therefore, this ﬁeld has a simple propagator. In order to incorporate the rules of the perturbative
(BCJ) double copy as they appear in scattering amplitudes [2], the next step is to write the interaction
vertices appropriately, in terms of those of a BCJ-Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory [73, 74]. We will
see the simplest example in the next subsection, for the three-point vertex.
The relation (3.4) can be easily inverted, so that
φ = Hµ
µ ≡H,
(3.6)
Bµν = 1
2 (Hµν −Hνµ) ,
(3.7)
hµν −P q
µνh = 1
2 (Hµν + Hνµ) −P q
µνH .
(3.8)
It turns out that hµν and hµν −P q
µνh diﬀer only by a diﬀeomorphism that does not aﬀect φ and Bµν
to this order in perturbation theory; see [33] for more details.
The crucial object in the construction above is P q
µν, which is deﬁned as a non-local operator,
P q
µν =
1
D −2

ηµν −qµ∂ν + qν∂µ
q · ∂

.
(3.9)
Here, qµ is a null reference vector which we take to be constant to avoid ambiguities.
The role
of P q
µν in (3.4) is best understood by taking the ‘fat graviton’ to be a linearised plane wave with
polarisation tensor εµν, obeying the transversality condition kµεµν = kµενµ = 0 , and the gauge ﬁxing
condition qµεµν = qµενµ = 0 . Then, the deﬁnition (3.4) is simply a coordinate-space version of the
decomposition of this polarisation tensor into the ‘skinny ﬁeld’ polarisations, discussed previously in
(2.2). The properties of the projector, ∆λ
λ = D −2 and ∆λ
µ ∆ν
λ = ∆ν
µ , are inherited by (D −2)P q
µν.
We use the symbol q in P q
µν to keep in mind the gauge dependence.
The application of this story to the four-dimensional JNW solution is straightforward.
First,
we extract from the solution (2.13)-(2.14) the ‘skinny ﬁelds’. Moving to de Donder gauge via the
coordinate transformation ρ = r + ρ0/2 , we have

where uµ = (1, 0, 0, 0) . We have now introduced a superscript (0) to indicate that these are the leading
order contributions (in κ), i.e., the linearised ﬁelds, as opposed to the next-to-leading order correction
considered in the next subsection. The linearised fat graviton then reads

The last step is the result of a computation in which the null reference vector was chosen to be
qµ = (1, 0, 0, 1), yielding lµ = (0, x, y, r + z)/(r + z), with q · l = 1.
3.2
Beyond linear level
Now we will discuss the ﬁrst correction to the linearised theory. We start by presenting the formalism,
and then consider the JNW case. For simplicity, we set the B-ﬁeld to vanish, so that the fat graviton
is symmetric.
3.2.1
Next-to-linear order formalism
In order to get the next-to-linear order term for the fat graviton, we apply the double copy procedure:
the three-point interaction is the double copy of the kinematic part of the Yang-Mills three-point
interaction. That is the whole point of working with the fat graviton [33]. In momentum space,

where Xµµ′ accounts for all the terms involving the projectors. So we have the general expression for
the fat graviton at this order, either in terms of the linearised fat graviton, or in terms of the linearised
skinny ﬁelds.
Suppose now that want to compare this directly with the JNW solution at next-to-leading order.
This is, of course, against the spirit of the double copy. In accordance with this spirit, we would
solve a complete problem in terms of the fat graviton description only, for which we have the simple
propagator and the interaction rules determined by the Yang-Mills rules. However, it may be useful
for certain purposes to provide the dictionary between the fat graviton and the skinny ﬁelds also
at next-to-leading order. This is cumbersome, because we have to keep track of gauge choices and
ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, which do not follow trivially from the linear case.
As in [33], we can build a
transformation tensor Tµν that represents all the gauge transformations and ﬁeld redeﬁnitions needed
to retrieve the skinny ﬁelds in their standard form – in particular, so that the gothic graviton is in de
Donder gauge. The dictionary at this order is
H(1)µν =h(1)µν −P µν

We allow the reference null vector q′ here to be diﬀerent from the linear-level discussion since this
clariﬁes the extraction of the skinny ﬁelds from the fat graviton. This proceeds as follows. From
(3.17), it can be checked that
h(1)µν −P µν
q′ (h(1)) = H(1)µν −T (1)µν −P µν
q′ (H(1) −T (1)) .

Exact double copy
So far we have considered the perturbative double copy for the JNW solution. We now discuss how
to deﬁne an exact double-copy map based on double ﬁeld theory (DFT). To this end, we introduce an
ansatz for generalised metric in DFT, by relaxing the null condition in the Kerr-Schild (KS) formalism,
and derive a pair of Maxwell solutions as the two factors in the double copy. We apply this general
formalism to the JNW case and show that both Maxwell solutions are the Coulomb potential, which
is therefore the ‘single copy’ of JNW.
4.1
Rewriting the JNW solution
We have introduced the JNW metric in a previous section. That metric solves the Einstein-dilaton
equations of motion in the Einstein frame.
However, for the remaining sections it will be more
convenient to work in the string frame. This is achieved by performing the following ﬁeld redeﬁnition
gE
µν →gS
µν = eσ(φ−φ0)gE
µν ,
φ0 = lim
r→∞φ ,
(4.1)
where the constant σ depends on the choice of normalisation for the dilaton. In this section, since
we are not working in perturbation theory, we will suppress the coupling constant κ, and use instead
a common string-frame normalisation convention for the ﬁelds. The action in the string frame then
reads

(2.15).
While JNW does not admit KS coordinates, we can express it in a similar manner, inspired by
the generalised KS form of double ﬁeld theory [22]. We start by deﬁning the area-radius coordinate

which is reminiscent of KS. Note, however, that only in the Schwarzschild case (i.e., b = 0, Ω= 1) do
l and ¯l coincide, and we recover the standard KS form of Schwarschild. Moreover, the metric does not
even admit the DFT generalisation of the KS metric [22], because ¯l is not null unless a = 0 or b = 0.
A relaxation of the DFT KS form is threfore required. Some of the properties of the vectors still hold:

Double ﬁeld theory and the relaxed Kerr-Schild ansatz
Double ﬁeld theory (DFT) is a closed string eﬀective ﬁeld theory with manifest T-duality, where
the latter is expressed by O(D, D) covariance in a ‘doubled spacetime’ where points are labelled as
(xµ, ˜xµ). It provides a uniﬁed geometric framework for the entire massless NS-NS sector, encoded
in an O(D, D) covariant manner in the DFT ﬁelds, which are the generalised metric HMN and the
DFT dilaton d. Here, M, N, · · · = 1, · · · , 2D are O(D, D) vector indices. The generalised metric is a
symmetric rank-2 O(D, D) tensor satisfying the O(D, D) constraint,
HMP J P QHQN = JMN ,
(4.18)
where JMN is the O(D, D) metric
JMN =
 0
δµν
δµν


,
J MN =
 0
δµν
δµν
0

,
(4.19)
which deﬁnes the inner product and raises and lowers the O(D, D) vector indices. One can solve
the O(D, D) constraint such that the generalised metric H and the DFT dilaton d encode the usual
string-frame massless NS-NS ﬁelds as follows:
HMN =

gµν
−gµρBρν
Bµρgρν gµν −BµρgρσBσν

,
e−2d = √−ge−2φ .
(4.20)
In general, O(D, D) vectors unify a D-dimensional vector and form ﬁeld pair into a single object. For
example, an arbitrary O(D, D) vector VM is parametrised in terms of a D-dimensional vector vµ and
a form ﬁeld kµ as
VM =
vµ
kµ

,
and
V M = J MNVN =
kµ
vµ

.
(4.21)
An important feature of DFT related to the double copy is the doubled local Lorentz group,
O(1, D −1)L × O(1, D −1)R, which is the maximally compact subgroup of O(D, D) including the
Lorentz group. The doubled local Lorentz group originates in the left-right mode decomposition of
the closed string, and shares the same origin as the KLT relations [1] in string scattering amplitudes,
– 13 –

which underlie the double copy. This structure is transparent if we introduce a chiral and anti-chiral
basis in the doubled vector space. One may recast the O(D, D) constraint as HM P HP N = δM N, and
it deﬁnes a pair of projection operators,
PM
N = 1
2
 δM
N + HM
N
,
¯PM
N = 1
2
 δM
N −HM
N
.
(4.22)
These project the doubled vector space into chiral and anti-chiral sectors which correspond to the left-
and right-moving sectors, respectively.
Motivated by the KS-like form of the JNW metric (4.12), we introduce an ansatz for H and d
in terms of two O(D, D) vectors, KM and ¯KM, where K is null but ¯K does not have to be null in
general,
KMKM = 0 ,
¯KM ¯KM ̸= 0 .
(4.23)
Let us consider a ﬂat background, g0µν = ηµν, Bµν = 0 and φ = constant, and denote the correspond-
ing background DFT ﬁelds as H0 and d0, where
H0MN =
ηµν
0
0
ηµν

,
d0 = constant .
(4.24)
We associate to H0 a pair of background projection operators P0 and ¯P0 via (4.22). As we have
described above, the chiralities are closely related to the underlying structure of the double copy, hence
we require deﬁnite chiralities on KM and ¯KM for the manifest left and right mode decomposition,
P0M
NKN = KM ,
¯P0M
N ¯KN = ¯KM .
(4.25)
This implies that K and ¯K are orthogonal, KM ¯KM = 0. One may solve the above chirality conditions
explicitly using (4.24), which yields
KM =

(4.26)
Now we are ready to write down a KS-like ansatz for the generalised metric:
HMN = H0MN + κϕ
 KM ¯KN + KN ¯KM

−κ2
2 ϕ2 ¯K2KMKN ,
d = d0 + κf ,
(4.27)
where κ is an expansion parameter. We refer to this form as the ‘relaxed KS ansatz’ because the null
condition for the DFT KS ansatz of [22] is partially relaxed; the latter is recovered when ¯K is a null
vector. Though the null condition is relaxed, the new ansatz satisﬁes the O(D, D) constraint (4.18)
automatically without further truncation. Substituting the parametrisation of K and ¯K in (4.26) into
(4.23), we obtain conditions on l and ¯l:
lµlµ = 0 ,
¯lµ¯lµ ̸= 0 ,
lµ¯lµ ̸= 0 ,
(4.28)
which are consistent with the JNW geometry as expressed in (4.12).
Interestingly, the feature of
the partially relaxed null condition is analogous to previous studies such as the ‘extended’ KS ansatz
[75] and the heterotic KS ansatz [29]. From the parametrisation of H, we can easily read oﬀthe
– 14 –

corresponding ansatz for the metric and Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld:
gµν = ηµν −
κϕ
1 + κϕ
2 (l · ¯l)l(µ¯lν) ,
gµν = ηµν + κϕl(µ¯lν) + κ2ϕ2¯l2
4
lµlν ,
Bµν =
κϕ
1 + κϕ
2 (l · ¯l)l[µ¯lν] .
(4.29)
It can easily be seen that the JNW solution ﬁts this ansatz. The JNW metric was written precisely
in this form in (4.14); we kept κ ̸= 1 here for clarity. As for the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld, given the JNW
expressions for ϕ, l and ¯l, it is of the form B = B(r) dR ∧dT. Since r is a function of R only, Bµν is
pure gauge and it can be set to zero.
4.3
DFT equations of motion and the single copy
The ﬁeld equations of DFT are given by the generalised curvatures, analogously to general relativity.7
The generalised curvature scalar R and tensor RMN deﬁned in (A.10) are the equations of motion of
the DFT dilaton and the generalised metric, respectively,
R = 0 ,
Rµν = 0 ,
(4.30)
where Rµν is a pullback of RMN into the D-dimensional spacetime. Note that Rµν is not symmetric
nor antisymmetric: the symmetric and antisymmetric parts are the equations of motion for the metric
and the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld, respectively. These reproduce the supergravity equations of motion for
the massless NS-NS ﬁelds in the string frame,
Rµν + 2∇µ∇νφ −1

R + 4 □φ −4 ∇µφ∇µφ −1
12HµνρHµνσ = 0 ,
(4.31)
∇ρHρµν −2Hρµν∇ρφ = 0 ,
which follow from the action (4.2).
Let us now discuss the ﬁeld equations subject to the relaxed KS ansatz (4.27). Recall that, in the
KS ansatz, an additional constraint is required in order to linearise the equations of motion, which
in the case of general relativity is the geodesic condition on the null vector ﬁeld. Such a constraint
is obtained by contracting the null vectors with the free indices of the (generalised) curvature tensor.
In the case of our relaxed KS ansatz, however, it is very cumbersome to work with this constraint.
Therefore, we will assume a stronger constraint, which is satisﬁed in a class of solutions that includes
JNW. We impose
¯KM∂MKN = 0 ,
(4.32)
which reduces to the second equation of (4.10). Note that, while the analogous condition also appeared
in the KS ansatz of DFT [22], in our ansatz we allow for KM∂M ¯KN ̸= 0. Given the null condition on

We now discuss how to extract the single copy from Rµν. By carrying out the same procedure
described in the conventional KS formalism, it can be shown that one obtains the Maxwell equations
from the gravity equations of motion. Suppose that the relaxed KS geometry admits at least one
Killing vector ξ. We also assume that the Killing vector is constant in our choice of coordinates, and
satisﬁes ξν∂νFµ1···µn = 0, where Fµ1···µn is an arbitrary tensor ﬁeld. We will be interested in the
timelike Killing vector ξ = ∂T for JNW. The single copy can be realised by contracting the Killing
vector ξ with one of the free indices of the ﬁeld equations of the generalised metric, Rµν. We further
require that l, ¯l and ξ are normalised as ξ · l = ξ · ¯l = 1, which is directly the case for JNW in (4.12).
Such a normalisation is always possible, since the KS form is preserved under the rescaling of l and ¯l.
Recall that Rµν is not symmetric nor antisymmetric, thus there are two distinct equations:
ξνRµν = 1

,
(4.34)
where we deﬁned ˜ϕ = e−2fϕ and we set κ = 1 for simplicity.
It is not immediately obvious how to extract the single copy from (4.34) due to the higher order
terms in κ, as opposed to the simpler case of the DFT KS ansatz. However, the terms linear in κ in
overlap with the analogous computation in the DFT KS case. Thus one may guess that the higher
order terms would be extra contributions over the KS single copy relation, where the two gauge ﬁelds
are proportional to lµ and ¯lµ. Let us collect the higher order terms, and express them with the help
of a pair of auxiliary vector ﬁelds Cµ and ¯Cµ, obeying

(4.35)
Notice that these deﬁnitions are possible because the currents on the right-hand side are conserved,
by virtue of the equations of motion, i.e., ∂µ∂ρ∂[ρCµ] = ∂µ∂ρ∂[ρ ¯Cµ] = 0. Even though the equations
look rather complicated to solve, the Killing direction components can be easily integrated as

∂ρ ¯Cξ + 1

(4.36)
where Cξ = ξµCµ and ¯Cξ = ξµ ¯Cµ, and we have used the normalisation, lξ = ¯lξ = 1. This indicates
that Cξ and ¯Cξ should be identiﬁed; indeed, that will be required by the uniqueness of the ‘zeroth’
– 16 –

copy to be discussed shortly. As for the other components of C and ¯C, we have to treat them case by
case. We will discuss the JNW example in the next subsection.
Making the use of the auxiliary ﬁelds, (4.34) reduces to the following compact form,
4e−2fξνRµν = ∂ρh
∂ρ( ˜ϕlµ + Cµ) −∂µ( ˜ϕlρ + Cρ)
i
= 0 ,
4e−2fξµRµν = ∂ρh
∂ρ( ˜ϕ¯lν + ¯Cν) −∂ν( ˜ϕ¯lρ + ¯Cρ)
i
= 0 .
(4.37)
This can be interpreted as a pair of Maxwell equations
∂µFµν = 0 ,
∂µ ¯Fµν = 0 ,
(4.38)
by identifying the gauge ﬁelds as the single copy
Aµ = ˜ϕlµ + Cµ ,
¯Aµ = ˜ϕ¯lµ + ¯Cµ .
(4.39)
Here, Fµν and ¯Fµν are the ﬁeld strengths of the Aµ and ¯Aµ respectively. This ensures that solutions
of (4.31) with the form of (4.29), subject to the constraint (4.32), can be represented by a pair of
Maxwell gauge ﬁelds. We emphasise again that Aµ and ¯Aµ are associated with left and right movers
in a string theory interpretation, which is consistent with the double copy.
Finally, we can consider also the ‘zeroth copy’. This is the scalar analogue of the gravity and
gauge-theory solutions. Since the gauge-theory solutions are Abelian, we expect that the scalar will
also be an ‘Abelianised’ version of the bi-adjoint scalar ﬁeld Φaa′. It is obtained in our formalism by
contracting the Killing vector into both free indices of Rµν, leading to a scalar equation of motion.
One may use the result of (4.37) to get a pair of d’Alembertian equations,
2( ˜ϕ + Cξ) = 0 ,
2( ˜ϕ + ¯Cξ) = 0 .
(4.40)
As we mentioned, Cξ and ¯Cξ should be identiﬁed. The single copy can therefore be recognised as
Φ = ˜ϕ + Cξ = ˜ϕ + ¯Cξ .
(4.41)
4.4
JNW and Coloumb
So far we have considered a general construction of the single copy for the relaxed KS ansatz (4.29).
We now apply the previous formalism to the JNW case, and show that the corresponding single copy
is the Coulomb potential (i.e., both Aµ and ¯Aµ are Coulomb). As noted before, we need to determine
the auxiliary vector ﬁelds Cµ and ¯Cµ to spell out the single copy. Since the JNW geometry is static,
with timelike Killing vector ξ = ∂T , CT and ¯CT can be solved straightforwardly from (4.36). If we
substitute all the necessary data, we get
∂rCT (r) = ∂r ¯CT (r) = −e−2f ϕ2
V 2 ∂rV + ∂rϕ + 2e−2f∂rf

(4.42)
in the asymptotically decaying case. The ﬁeld strengths associated to (4.39) satisfy

1 −r0
r
 −r0+a−b
r0
li = a + b
R2
li = (a + b)
R3
Xi .
(4.43)
These are nothing but the electric ﬁeld for the Coulomb potential, and it turns out that all other
components of the ﬁeld strengths vanish. In particular, we can easily show that the spatial components
– 17 –

of the static, spherically symmetric gauge ﬁelds Aµ and ¯Aµ are pure gauge. This is better seen in
spherical coordinates, where the only non-vanishing spatial component of l, ¯l, C or ¯C is the radial
one, and it only depends on the radial coordinate, which is also the case for ˜ϕ. Therefore, the relevant
spatial vector ﬁelds are all curl free,
∂[i( ˜ϕlj]) = ∂[i( ˜ϕ¯lj]) = ∂[iCj] = ∂[i ¯Cj] = 0 .
(4.44)
Hence, Ai and ¯Ai are pure gauge, and only AT and ¯AT contribute to the ﬁeld strength.
This shows that the single copy for the JNW solution is given by a point electric charge as expected.
The corresponding electric charge parameter is associated to the linear sum of the mass and dilaton
coupling in the string frame, a + b. As argued earlier in the paper, the two parameters in gravity
reduce to one via the single copy.
One interesting point is that the single copy exists and is the same whether the gravity solution
is a naked singularity (b ̸= 0) or the Schwarzschild solution (b = 0). This highlights the fact the single
copy does not reﬂect the causal structure of the gravity solution. Some reﬂection indicates, however,
that this is to be expected. The single copy does not apply to the full metric, but only to the deviation
from the Minkowski metric. It is from the interplay between the Minkowski metric and the deviation
that the causal structure arises.
Finally, using (4.41), it is straightforward to consider the zeroth copy. As expected, the associated
linearised bi-adjoint ﬁeld for the JNW solution is a Coulombic potential,
Φ = ˜ϕ + CT = a + b
R
,
(4.45)
which is the static, spherically symmetric solution that decays asymptotically.
Therefore, both the single and zeroth copies for the JNW solution coincide with those of the
Schwarzschild solution, up to irrelevant constant factors.

Conclusion
In this paper, we claim that the most general double copy of the Coulomb solution is the JNW
solution, which includes a mass parameter and a dilaton parameter. The JNW solution reduces to the
Schwarzschild solution if the dilaton vanishes, which is consistent with previous work in the vacuum
case. We support our claim both in perturbation theory, extending the ‘fat graviton’ analysis of [33],
and in an exact map, extending the double ﬁeld theory Kerr-Schild ansatz of [22]. One remarkable
feature of the latter approach is that it exhibits the double copy origin of Kerr-Schild-type maps of
solutions between gravity and gauge theory, by associating the pair of Kerr-Schild-type vectors to left
and right movers in closed string theory. Moreover, it shows that, when the dilaton is turned on, the
exact double copy is best expressed in the string frame, rather than the Einstein frame.
There are several directions of interest for future work. One unsatisfying aspect of our work is
that the perturbative approach and the exact approach discussed here were not explicitly connected.
Due to gauge choices and ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, this appears to be cumbersome. And yet it would be
very interesting to see how the perturbative double copy could be resummed into the exact double
copy. This would provide important clues as to what is the exact double copy analogue of the colour-
kinematics duality, which underlies the double copy in scattering amplitudes.
On the exact double copy front, an extension of the analysis in this paper would allow us to study
the double copy interpretation of the most general static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically
ﬂat solution to NS-NS gravity, which is known [76]. It is more general than the JNW solution, in that
– 18 –

it admits a B-ﬁeld whose ﬁeld strength is spherically symmetric. The ‘single copy’ is not, however,
the Coulomb solution, since two distinct gauge-theory solutions are required in order to introduce the
antisymmetric B-ﬁeld via the double copy. The extension of our work to heterotic double ﬁeld theory,
building on [29], would be interesting too.
It should also be possible to extend the vacuum Weyl double copy [15], and a higher-dimensional
version based on [77], to include the dilaton and B-ﬁeld, using ideas from double ﬁeld theory. In
fact, this could potentially elucidate some aspects of the generalised curvatures of double ﬁeld theory,
alluded to in the appendix.
It is clear that there is much more to explore in how double ﬁeld theory expresses the double copy.

Equations of motion in double ﬁeld theory
We review here the derivation of the double ﬁeld theory (DFT) equations of motion. The covariant
derivative and its curvature tensors are deﬁned with respect to the so-called generalised Lie derivative
or generalised diﬀeomorphism. It plays the role of gauge symmetry in DFT, and acts on the DFT
ﬁeld content as
( ˆLXH)MN = XP ∂P HMN + (∂MXP −∂P XM)HP N + (∂NXP −∂P XN)HMP ,
ˆLXd = XM∂Md −1
2∂MXM ,
(A.1)
where, with respect to the generalised Lie derivative, the generalised metric H is a rank-2 tensor and the
DFT dilaton d is a scalar density. The gauge parameter XM combines the diﬀeomorphism parameter
ξµ and the one-form gauge parameter Λµ for the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld in an O(D, D) covariant manner
XM = {ξµ , Λµ} .
(A.2)
For closure of the algebra of generalised diﬀeomorphisms (i.e., the Jacobi identity for ˆL), we have to
impose the section condition
∂M∂MF1 = 0 ,
∂MF1∂MF2 = 0 ,
(A.3)
where F1 and F2 are arbitrary functions on doubled space. The section condition is equivalent to
ignoring the winding coordinate ˜x dependence,
∂M =
 ˜∂µ
∂µ

=
 0
∂µ

.
(A.4)
As for the covariant diﬀerential operator of the generalised Lie derivative (A.1), we deﬁne the
covariant derivative acting on an O(D, D) tensor as

where ΓMNP is the DFT connection [78, 79]. One may try to obtain the DFT connection using the
compatibility and torsion-free conditions, analogously to Riemannian geometry. However, it turns
out that these conditions are not suﬃcient for determining all the components. Fortunately, one can
project out the undetermined part using the projection operators (4.22), and the determined part is

Let us turn to the curvature tensors R and RMN in terms of the DFT connection (A.6). First,
we introduce 4-index object SMNP Q deﬁned as
SMNP Q = 1

 RMNP Q + RP QMN −ΓR

(A.7)
where RMNP Q is deﬁned from the standard commutator of the covariant derivatives
RMNP Q = ∂MΓNP Q −∂NΓMP Q + ΓMP
RΓNRQ −ΓNP
RΓMRQ .
(A.8)
One can show that SMNP Q satisﬁes symmetry properties analogous to the Riemann tensor, namely
SMNP Q = S[MN][P Q] = S[P Q][MN] and the ﬁrst Bianchi identity,
SM[NP Q] = 0 .
(A.9)
However, it is not a tensor with respect to the generalised Lie derivative and cannot be a physi-
cally meaningful object. Instead, we can obtain meaningful tensors by contracting SMNP Q with the
projection operators. The generalised curvature tensor and scalar are deﬁned as
RMN = 2P(M
P ¯PN)
QP RSSRP SQ ,
R = 2P MNP P QSMP NQ ,
(A.10)
and one can show that these are covariant under O(D, D), as well as under generalised diﬀeomor-
phisms. Substituting the parametrisations (4.20), the equations of motion reduce to the conventional
supergravity equations of motion (4.31). The generalised curvatures satisfy an identity analogous to
that of the Einstein tensor, ∇µGµν = 0, namely [80, 81]
