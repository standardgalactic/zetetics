PREFACE 
This book is the third volume belonging to the series of 
prooeedings of the Moriond Astrophysios meetings. 
It follows "Cosmology and partioles" published in 1981 by 
les Editions Frontieres and "The birth of the Uni verse" whioh 
appeared in 1982 thanks to the same publisher. 
This workshop took plaoe on maroh 1983 at La Plagne and as 
in 1981 and 1982 took advantage of the simultaneous presence of 
the partiole physicists and the astrophysioists. As said in the 
title of the 
book the participants 
have 
presented 
their 
most 
reoent views on the evolution of large struotures and 143.laxies 
and the relevance of these questions 
on 
partiole 
physics and 
cosmology. Among the many developments which are at the origin 
of the thirty five papers gathered here, 
three main themes have 
been touched on by several speakers during the workshop. They 
are (i) the influence of the mass of neutrinos and other "inos" 
predioted by the "Supersymmetry" theories, 
which are the more 
likely oandidates for the hidden mass of the Universe, (ii) the 
dynamics of triaxial galaxies and (iii) the possible ocourence 
of 
pregalactio 
stars 
with 
a 
debate 
on 
their 
hypothetioal 
nucleosynthetic role. 1'1l.ny different views !'ave been presented 
on these three topics (and many others) whioh prove the liveness 
of the physical cosmology. 
For 
the 
editor 
it 
!'as 
been 
quite 
diffioult 
to 
find 
a 
reasonable 
and 
logioal 
order 
to 
arrange 
the 
content 
of 
the 
book. The contributions of the partioipants to this very lively 
and exoiting workshop have been put in six different sections. 
In 
the 
first 
section 
the 
reader 
will 
find 
four 
papers 
dealing with the very early Universe and the influence of the 
partiole 
physios 
on 
it. 
After a 
summary on 
the 
influenoe 
of 
inflation and supersymmetry on oosmology written by K.A. Olive 
(CERN), 
R. Hakim and S. Collin 
(Meudon) draw our attention on 
the 
present 
arbitrary 
status 
ooncerning 
the 
quark-!'adron 
transition oocuring during the very early Universe. P. Salati

J. Audouze and J. Tran Thanh Van (eds.),

PREFACE 
(Anne:Jy ) 
shows that systems of 
two 
heavy leptons should be 
extremely heavy (M > 15 Gev) to fulfill the :Jonditions put by 
the early Universe. To end up thi s se:Jtion R. Coquereaux ( CERN ) 
provides 
an 
interpretation 
of 
the 
:Jo smologi:Jal 
:Jonsta nt 
(appearing 
in 
the 
Eiqstei n 
equations ) 
in 
terms 
of 
fields 
theories and 
dis:Jusses again the 
physi:Jal 
mea ning 
of 
this 
:Jo nstant 
and 
its 
impli:Ja tions 
on 
large 
stru:Jtures 
of 
the 
U niverse. 
The se:Jond 
se:Jtion is devoted 
to large stru:Jtures a nd 
espedally 
the 
pa n:Jakes 
whi:Jh 
appear 
when 
adiaba ti::! 
perturbations generate and propagate at the end of the ra dia tive 
era . R. Bond (Cambridge ) and :Jollabora tors study the sho:Jks, the 
:Jooling 
and 
the 
fragmentation 
suffered 
by 
the 
pa n:Jakes 
in 
neutrino 
dominated 
universe and 
show that the :Jooling 
still 
remains a problem in su:Jh model s. A. Szalay ( Budapest) et al 
:Jonsider 
the 
same 
pi:Jture 
of 
pan:Jakes 
in:Jluding 
ma ssive 
neutrinos and estimate the temperature flu:Jtua tions whi:Jh should 
appear in the bla :Jk body reli :J  radia tion as a :Jonsequen:Je of 
thi s  pi:Jture. They :Ja n already :Jon:Jlude that very large pa n:Jakes 
:Ja n be ruled out from 
su:Jh estima tes. This :Jontribution is 
followed by a review presented by N. Mandolesi ( Bologna )  on the 
determinations 
of 
the 
distorsions 
of 
the 
:Jo smi:J ba :Jkground 
radiation. S. White ( Berkeley )  
et 
al 
have 
performed N 
body 
simula tions show that the neutrino s:Jales ex:Jeed by very large 
fa :Jtors the s:Jale of galaxies for a ny :Jhoi:Je of :Jo smologi:Ja l  
parameters ( S1 and H the hubble :Jonsta nt espe:Jially ) .  A:J:Jording 
to these authors ma ssive neutrinos do not seem to solve the 
problem of the O:J:Juren:Je and evolution of large stru:Jtures. Then 
C. Hogan ( Calte:Jh) suggests that prega la :Jti:J sour:Jes of energy 
su:Jh 
as 
qua sars 
or 
protogalaxies 
may 
have 
influen:Jed 
the 
development 
of 
large 
s:Jale 
galaxy 
distributions. 
These 
di stributions might be due to this early a:Jti vi ty rather tha n  
the 
dire:Jt 
effe:Jt 
of adiaba ti:J or 
i sothermal 
flu:Jtuations. 
Finally after a 
short :Jomment made by R. S:Jhaeffer ( Sa:Jlay ) 
:Jon:Jerning 
the 
relevan:Je 
of 
pa n:Jakes 
on 
the 
sta tisti:Jal 
:Jorrelation fun:Jtion, 
P. Flin ( Krakow ) 
shows how to use the 
brightness profiles of galaxy ::!lusters, their ellipti:Jities and 
position angles 
to 
elimi nate 
(rather 
than unfortuna tely 
to 
support )  models ::!On:Jerning the origin of ga laxies. 
The 
third 
se:Jtion 
deals with ma ssive 
halos a nd 
more 
generally with invi sible matter. D.J. Hegyi (Ann Arbor ) reviews 
the eviden:Je in favour of the fa:Jt t hat parti:Jles involved in 
supersymmetry 
theories 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
mo st 
promi sing 
:Jandidates to 
:Jonstitute the ma ssive halo s. J .R. Prima:Jk and 
G.R. Blumenthal 
( Santa 
Cruz ) 
favour 
the 
::!old 
neutri nos as 
:Jonstituents of 
the 
dark 
matter 
whi::!h 
is a l so ,

them ,

puts 
the emphasis more on a hierar:Jhy model t han on a pa n:Jake

xi 
model and suggests that if the Universe is dominated with dark 
ma tter it l eads on a very 
na tural way 
to 
the formation o f  
galaxies and espeoially o f  globula r olusters. D .  N .  Sohramm and 
K. Freese 
( Chioago) 
review the oosmologioal oonstraints whioh 
oa n be put on the ma ss of neutri nos and other "inos" (oomi ng 
from sup er symmetry theories) . 
C .  Norman ( Leiden) and 
J. Silk 
( Pari s )  propose a model of forma tion of dwarf galaxies triggered 
by the effioienoy 
of ma ssive neutrino aooretion by 
baryonio 
oores : the preexisting baryonio oore aooreting dark halo s  (made 
of ma ssive 
neutrino s )  
oan 
oollapse 
and 
form 
suoh 
galaxies. 
Finally P. Vader (Yale )  propose that ma ssive halos may inhibite 
star formation prooesses : this would mean than blues galaxies 
should have halo s  more ma ssive tha n  red gp.laxies in whioh star 
formation prooess has been more effioient. 
Then in the fourth seotion the ooourenoe of pregalaotio 
( popula tion 
III, 
IV 
eto ) 
sta rs 
are 
disoussed 
in 
severa l 
oontr:i 'ȶutions : M .  Rees ( Cambridge) proposes the idea that no n 
baryonio 
matter 
promote 
the 
oondensa tion 
of 
sma ll 
soale 
pregalaotio objeots whioh would lead eventually to galaxies and 
olu sters of gp.laxies. J. Silk (Paris ) makes the prediotion that 
the first sta:'s were ma ssive ( 
100 solar ma sses) .  Similarly 
H. 
Zinneoker and 
S. 
Drapatz 
( Garohing )  suggest that therma l 
instabilities are able to i nduoe fragmenta tion at very early 
stages and lead to a first genera tion of massive popula tion II 
stars. 
These 
papers are 
fol lowed 
by 
the 
quite 
provooative 
argument presented by J. Audouze and J. Silk ( Paris ) aooording 
whom the light elements might be produoed in a pregalaotio era 
ra ther 
than during 
the Big 
Bang . 
They 
speoulate about 
the 
possibility 
for 
ma ssive hydrogen made 
stars 
to 
generate He 
oosmio 
rays 
impingi ng 
on 
pure 
H 
interstellar 
medium 
and 
produoing Deuterium without overproduoing too muoh lithium. The 
propo sal 
of 
M .  
Rees 
( Cambridge ) 
to 
produoe 
D 
and 
Li 
in 
spal la tion 
and 
neutron 
oapture 
prooesses

around 
prega laotio blaok holes in a gas where He has been produoed 
during 
the 
Big 
Bang 
is 
oertainly 
less 
"radioal" 
than 
the 
previous 
one . 
Finally 
the 
early 
nuoleosynthesis 
whioh 
i s  
disoussed 
in 
these 
two 
papers 
i s  also 
oonsidered 
in 
the 
oontribution 
of C .  Gry (Verrieres le Buisson) et al . In this 
paper it 
is argued 
that i nfall 
of 
prooessed material 
( i. e. 
havi ng 
been 
mixed 
with 
the 
out 
produot 
of 
stellar 
nuoleosynthesi s) ooouring during the evolution of galaxies might 
all eviate the diffioulties enoountered by the Sta ndard Big Bang 
nuoleosynthesi s. 
The two last seotions deal with the evolution of galaxies. 
Seotion V gathers the papers oonoerned by the struoture and the 
dynamioal evolution of galaxies. T. de Zeeuw ( L eiden) provides 
the reader with inhomogeneous triaxial mass model s desoribing 
stellar systems of that shape. A .  Wilkinson ( M3.nohester) reports 

xi 
PREFACE 
on the first attempt made to fit a N-body potential with an 
Eddington potential in order to make a global fit of triaxial 
N-body 
model. 
C. 
Norman 
(Leiden) 
provides 
a 
self 
consistent 
treatment of the dynami:!al evolution of spheroidal systems with 
a 
central black hole. 
P. 
Crane 
(ESQ 
Garching) 
compares and 
shows a good agreement between the galaxY distributions deduced 
from 
Zwicky 
:!a talogue 
of 
gp.laxies 
to 
a 
gp.laxy 
distribution 
function 
based 
on 
statistical 
thermodynamics 
of 
gra votherma l 
objects. 
The 
two 
next 
papers 
deal 
with 
the 
physics 
of 
the 
galatic disks : 
R. G. 
Carlberg (Toronto) shows that the heating 
by transient spiral waves provides a natural explanation to the 
mean radial velocity dispersion and therefore the vertical scale 
height of the gp.lactic disks. 
E. G. 
Lacey (Cambridge) analyzes 
the 
heating 
and 
therefore 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
thickness 
of 
stellar gp.lactic disks by the S:!a ttering of the stars induced by 
massive objects (giant molecular clouds of the disk or massive 
black holes in the ralo). 
Finally the two last papers of this section are concerned 
by the rotation of gp.laxies (and also clusters). 
G. 
Efsthatiou 
(Cambridge) 
and 
J. 
Barnes 
(Berkeley) 
review 
the 
recent 
observations 
of 
the 
rotational 
properties 
of 
gp.laxies 
and 
clusters and propose that these objects :!an be set in rotation 
by tidal torques of neighbors. 
R. 
Wyse (Princeton) and B. Jones 
(Meudon) study the correlation between the rotational properties 
of the galaxies and their surface brightness (the high rotation 
elipti:!als and also the brightest) in terms 
of 
dissipa tional 
collapse. 
Besides the contribution of Gry et al the four last papers 
which 
constitute 
section VI deal 
with 
chemical 
evolution 
of 
gp.laxies J . W. Truran (Urbana-Champaign) provides a guided tour 
in the 
domain 
pertaining 
both to the nucleosynthesis and the 
gp.lactic 
evolution. 
C. 
Chiosi 
(Padova) 
and 
F. 
Matteucci 
(Frascati) reported on two different works : in the first, 
they 
built models of chemical evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies 
based on the stochastic formation process of stars as suggested 
by Gerola and Seiden (Yorktowns). In the second, 
they show that 
the 
chemical 
yields 
of 
C, 0 and 
Fe 
should 
vary 
during 
the 
galactic history in order to account for the observed abundances 
population I and II stars. The last paper of these proceedings 
is 
the 
report 
of 
observations 
of 
specific 
galactic 
nuclei 
(intermediate Seyfert type) :!alled liners performed by B. E. J. 
Pagel (Herstmonceux) with the Anglo Australian Telescope. 
I hope that the reader will enjoy these texts as much as 
the participants enjoy the pre sen ta tions of these contributions 
and the very lively discussions on these fascinating topics. The 
burden of the organization of this meeting and the edition of 
this book has been shared with many individuals who are thanked

more specifically in the french "Avant-propos". I just want to 
end up 
this 
preface by mentioning that this meeting has been 
made possible thanks to the generosity of the Scientific Affair 
Division of NATO. This book comes from the work, 
the talent and 
the 
friendness of all 
the authors whom I want to thank most 
warmly for their effort.

COSMOLOGY OF THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE 
AND FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS 


PRIMORDIAL INFLATION AND SUPER-COSMOLOGY 
Keith A. Olive 
CERN, Geneva, Switzerland 
ABSTRACT 
A co mplete locally supersy!TI!letric model for the early universe 
is reviewed. 
It begins with primordial inflation j ust after the 
Planck time. The (non-trivial) breaking of SU(5) is discussed in 
detail, with specific emphasis on baryon generation at 
T  0 (107) GeV and monopole suppression (no longer accomplished by 
inflation) . 
Gravitational effects are taken into account through 
N = 1 supergravity and play an essential role. 
What one is left 
with is a problem-free scenario containing all the benef its of 
Guth ' s  original inflation as well as density p erturbations of a 
desirable magnitude for the formation of galaxies , a large baryon 
to photon ratio, and a possibly observable f lux of magnetic mono­
poles . By inserting only two scales , the Planck scale and the 
supersymmetry breaking scale, both the weak and GUT scales are 
produced. 
I .  GUTs , COSMOLOGY AND INFLATION 
The advent of Grand Unified Theories ( r,uTs) 1) has certainly 
been a cornerstone for our understanding of the very early stages 
of the Universe. GUTs have , and continue , to resolve questions 
that were once thought only answerable by an initial condition .  The 
most celebrated of these questions is the origin 2) of the small 
baryon asymmetry present in the Universe today . Pre-GUT models 
were only able to speculate that the net baryon to photon ratio

is due to an initial condition or that initially n 2 0 (1) and that 
sometime during the evolution of the Universe a large amount of 
entropy was produced. 
The GUT alternative is clearly preferred as 
it ascribes the origin of n to microphysical processes . 
Along with its solution to the problem of baryon generation, 
GUTs predict the exis tence of magnetic monopoles (GUMs)4) .

It is known that today, the universe is neither curvature­
dominated nor vacuum-dominated. 
In particular, we know that the

This is the curvature problem7) . 
The curvature problem is typical of a problem whose solution 
is explained by inflation7) . Remember that this problem (1 .10) 
arose when we assumed an adiabatically expanding Universe 
(i.e. a Ì  l/T) . 
If however, there was some epoch in which this was 
not true and that we can let a grow by a factor 1028 with little or 
no change in T, the prob lem is solved .  A temporary De Sitter phase 
has just this property. 
If the Universe at some stage where do­
minated by a cosmological constant eq . (1 . 7) indicates that 
a 2 eHt rather than the power law type expansions associated with 
matter or radiation dominated Universes . 
Once again we see that GUTs can save the day. 
Inherrent in 
GUTs are phase transitions . 
In particular , these phase transitions 
Ʃre associated with a change in the vacuum energy density and if 
for some reason the Universe supercooled and remained in the false 
vacuum below Tc, the Universe would become vacuum-dominated. The 
vacuum energy density would act like a cosmological constant and 
the Universe would enter an approximate De Sitter phase7'9) . This 
is the well known inflationary Universe scenario7) . The basic idea 

6 
K. A. OLIVE 
was that when the energy density in radiation p 'V T4 fell below 
the vacuum energy density V0 of the symmetric phase te . g. SU(S) ], 
the Universe would begin to expand exponentially . The phase 
transition to the broken phase [e.g. SU(3) 
x SU (2) x U (l) ] would 
then occur through the formation of bubbles whose formation rate 
is given by 1 0) 
p Î D1. .(2.- B 
(i. n) 
where D is a characteristic mass scale and B is the action for 
tunnelling. When P 'V H4 the transition is over. The requirement 
however, that the exponential expansion last long enough (28 orders 
of magnitude) requires B to be very large. In fact, it has been 
shown1 1 ) that in order to have enough inflation B is so large that 
the transition never finishes . This results in a highly irregular 
Universe containing a few bubb les of the broken phase imbedded in 
a still exponentially expanding Universe in the symmetric phase. 
The solution of this difficulty is called the new inflationary 
Universe12'1 3) . 
In this revised scenario, the scalar field which 
drives the phase transition [the 24 for SU(S) ] tunnels through the 
barrier responsible for supercooling before the inflation begins . 
Suppose the scalar potential were very flat so that the field took 
a long time to reach its vacuum expectation value (v.e.v. ) 
v = (Ol'lo) at the global minimum after tunnelling. 
Then inside a 
single bubble the vacuum energy density wo uld still be approximately 
constant and the bubble would expand exponentially. If a single 
bubble expanded by 28 orders of magnitude, we need no longer be 
concerned with "finishing" the phase transition. Eventually the 
field will reach the global minimum and reheat the Universe by 
converting the vacuum energy density to radiation. 
Indeed, such flat potentials do exist. 
They are the Coleman­
Weinberg14) potentials which are derived by considering first order 
radiative corrections to the tree potential . Their properties with 
respect to cosmology have been discussed in detail 1 5) and here I 
shall only concentrate on their inflationary capabilities 1 2'1 3) . 
In general the Coleman-Weinberg potential may be written as

self-couplin¥ aMd (¢2) is the quantum expectation value of ¢2 in 
curved space 6•17) . 
In order to establish whether or not sufficient inflation can 
occur in an SU (S) Coleman-Weinberg model, I will follow the pro­
posal of Hawking and Moss 18) , that the tunnelling event occurs 
in a spacially homogeneous manner over a horizon volume. The 
tunnelling action in this case is given by18)

ating the two minima at ¢ =  0 and ¢ =  v) 1 9)

(1.17) 
(1.18) 
In order for the Hawking and Moss18) picture to be correctly 
realized21) , the action B must be >> 1. (Otherwise the transition 
might take place b efore the De Sitter expansion begins . )  Although 
this may not be a sufficient condition2 2) (i . e .  other small actions 
may exist) it is necessary for inflation. The second requirement 
for inflation is that the timescale to roll over from the local 
maximum to the global minimum is long enough to guarantee sufficient 
inflation. 
The roll over timescale is

In s tandard SU(5) , A is determined. The dominant contribu­

gB = 36 and mX y = (25/8) g2v2 we have

In the range of interest the ln term in (1.21) 
is about 5 and in order for the double inequality to be consistent 
we must have 
(1.24) 
hence the first maj or stumbling block for inflation in SU (5). 
There are, however, several other reasons wh;r standard SU (5) will 
not provide an inflationary scenario . 
The upper limit on the 
effective mass2 D in (1. 21) implies a mass for the scalar field 
0 (108) GeV. 
This requires an enormous amount of finetuning as 
scalar masses will generally pick up corrections 0 (1015) GeV. 
Linde17) has also pointed out that unless A in (1. 14) is 
ތ 5 x 10-3 scalar field fluctuations will drive the transition 
without sufficient inflation (the ¢4 coupling here is an order of 
magnitude larger). 
The most devastating blow to the inflationary scenario in 
standard SU (5) comes from the production of density fluctua­
tions23-26). GUTs do very well in producing27) the desired

Without going into too much detail ,  it can be shown23-26) that the

Of course ,  what we want is a value 6p/p cv 0 (10-4) in order to 
remain compatible with limits on the isotropy of the background 
radiation and still remain strong enough to eventually produce 
galaxies. 
In the remaining sections of this contribution ,  I will try 
to argue that although the above looks very discouraging, the 
inflationary scenario is by no means dead. I will begin by dis­
cussing the motivations for considering supersymmetry and super­
gravity in section 2. 
In section 3, I will discuss a specific 
model for inflation in the context of supergravity. Finally, I 
will follow through the post-inflationary period through the 
breaking of SU (S) in section 4. Much of what will be discussed 
in the following is a result of a very fruitful collaboration with 
J. Elli s ,  D.V. Nanopoulos , M. Srednicki and K. Tamvakis. 
II. 
SUPERSYMMETRY, SUPERGRAVITY AND COSMOLOGY 
Supersymmetry29) is a symmetry which directly relates bosons 
and fermions. 
Supersymmetric theories30) are classified according 
to the number of charges N ,  present in the theory . 
For gauge theories 
with maximum spin = 1 fields one is restricted to N . 4. 
Local 
supersymmetry or supergravity31) is consistent with gauge theories 
for N . 8. 
In the simplest supersymmetric theory (N = 1) , the 
particle content is divided into two types of representations. 
The first is a gauge supermultiplet, which associates to each 
gauge boson a gauge fermion. 
That is , in addition to the gauge 
bosons such as the photon, gluons , w± and Z ,  there will be photinos , 
gluinos, winos and zinos. The self-interactions of these particles 
are determined by the gauge coupling constant. The second type of 
representation is the chiral supermultiplet which includes the 
quark and lepton fields and their associated scalar partners and 
the Higgs fields along with their fermionic partners. 
The chiral 
superfields will have both gauge interactions as well as self­
interactions which are determined by a superpotential f. For a 
renormalizable theory, the superpotential can be at most cubic in 
the fields. 
In a globally supersymmetric theory29) , the effective poten­
tial describing the self-interactions of the chiral superfields 
is derived from the superpotential f as follows

Note that regardless of the superpotential f ,  the exponential in 
(2.4) renders V (˙i) non-renormalizable . Thus , because of the non­
renormalizability of supergravity, there is no longer any use to 
the restriction to, at most ,  cubic terms in f .  Indeed, we shall 
make much use of this extra freedom. Local supersymmetry is also 
unbroken for f˙. = 0 .  
Aside froml.its asthetic value, supersymmetry is o f  course very 
useful for curing maladies in particle physics and as we shall see , 
in cosmology. Non supersymmetric gauge theories seem to require 
scalar fields for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Apart from this , 
there is no other reason (theoretical or experimental) for their 
existence. 
Supersymmetry has them already built in. But the 
immense popularity of supersymmetry is because of the possibility 
it offers of solving the gauge heirarchy problem3 3) . 
Stated simply, 
the gauge heirarchy problem is twofold. 
On the one hand, one would 
like to understand why there is the apparant discrepancy in the mass 
scales 
(2. 6) 
Secondly, in ordinary GUTs , when one calculates radiative correc­
tions to scalar masses (which are responsible for generating the 
scales Mw and Mc) they tend to always push the light scalars (with 

PRIMORDIAL INFLATION AND SUPER-COSMOLOGY 
1 1  
masses Mw) up to the heavy ones (with masses MG). In order to pre­
serve the heirarchy, an enormous amount of finetuning must take 
place. 
Supersymmetry has the possibility of solving33) the second 
aspect of the heirarchy problem. Because of the existence of 
so-called non-renormalization theorems34) , which guarantee cancel­
lations (to all orders in perturbation theory) when calculating 
radiative corrections in an exactly supersymmetric theory. Thus , 
once a particular value of a parameter is set at the tree level ,  
it stays there. 
In a broken supersymmetric theory there wil l  be 
corrections proportional to the mass splitting between bosons and 
fermions 
(2. 7) 
where Ms is the sca le of supersymmetry breaking and E is some 
coupling constant . 
These cancellations have a lso been employed in 
attempts to cure the strong CP problem35) . 
In analogy with spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge theories , 
global supersymmetry is broken with the appearance of a goldstino. 
In local supersymmetry, the goldstino is eaten by the gravitino , 
the superpartner of the spin 2 graviton, through the superhiggs 
effect36'37) . 
The mass of the gravitino is determined in much the 
same way as that of gauge boson in ordinary gauge theories 
(2.8) 
where g is a gauge coup ling constant and (') is the v.e.v . of the 
scalar field breaking the gauge symmetry. 
The corresponding order 
parameter for supersymmetry is MƧ and the gravitino mass .is given 
by3 7)

(2.9) 
In particular s in (2. 7) should be O (mo/2
/Mp) so that mass splittings 
and mass corrections should be38) 
(2. 10) 
in order to preserve the hierarchy. 
In fact in this way, broken 
supersymmetry generates39•40) the weak interaction scale .  In 
section 4, we will see how the GUT scale is also generated by Ms· 
Let us now see how supersymmetry affects the cosmological 
inflationary scenario20•41>. 
If one recalls , one of the maj or 
difficulties with the new inflationary model stemmed from the dis­
crepency between (1. 23) and (1. 24). 
Radiative corrections in a 
supersymmetric theory, however, are greatly altered. 
In exact 
supersymmetry, the no-renormalization theorems34) tell us that first 
order radiative corrections of the Coleman-Weinberg type are exactly 
zero. 
Indeed by glancing at the expression (1.13) for the '4

total heli city gB, there is an assoi cated fermion of mass m p = mB

= 1 chiral superfield there 
are two s calars per fermion and for gau ge superfields , one gau ge 
boson per gau ge fermion) . Hen ce with exa ct supersymmetry

We know, however, that supersymmetry must be broken in nature

Ms si  2 x 1010 GeV. 
Hence a glimmer appears that inflation and 
supersymmetry will go well together. 
The maj or effects , until now, of supersymmetry were that it 
i) produced a larger barrier to keep the action B large and insure 
sufficient supercooling and ii) by lowering the vacuum energy 
density of the symmetric state, it produced a flatter potential 
allowing for a longer roll-over time scale . 
The above, however, 
was not a supersymmetric model for inflation, but rather an indi­
cation of which way things will go . 
In the following sections , I 
shall look closely at real supersymmetric models and their potential 
for supplying a complete and problem-free cosmological scenario. 
III. PRIMORDIAL INFLATION 
As we have seen, in order to preserve38) the gauge hierarchy , 
any realistic supersymmetric model will need relatively small mass 
splittings O (Mw) .  This would imply a supersymmetry breaking scale 
(3 .1) 
At energy scales at or above the GUT scale , the effects of super­
symmetry breaking will be negligible. 
It seems reasonable, there­
fore to consider inflation in the context of (nearly) exact super­
symmetry. 
First order corrections to the tree potential may then 
be done away with entirely. 
Let us furthermore, for reasons which 
will become clear shortly ,  consider the field which drives inflation 
to be a chiral superfield gauge singlet cjJ (t he inflaton ) which 
receives a v. e.v. (O [cji[O) = µ with 
(3. 2) 
Before specifying a particular superpotential for the inf la­
ton, suppose that the derived effective zero temperature potential 
can be put in the polynomial form41) 
(3. 3) 
Starting with a general potential of this form (which can hopefully 
be derived in a supersymmetric theory) , we can derive what condi­
tions must be imposed on the parameters a ,  S, y, and 6 in order to 
achieve inflation. To begin with, we assume that all subsequent 

14 
K. A. OLIVE 
phase trans 1t 1ons will produce a chan ge in the vacuum ener gy density 
which is ne gli gible when compared with the one discussed here . 
This will be true, of course ,  if the inflation scale is much lar ger 
than the GUT scale for example. 
Thus at the global minimum of the 
potential (at (0!¢!0) = µ) we will require that the cosmolo gical 
constant vanish. The effective cosmolo gical constant (after the 
transition) is just the value of the potential at .the minimum 
A== 
(3 .4) 
thus we require 
V {/A-) 
= 0 
(3.S) 
We must also insure that at ¢ = µ the potential has a m 1n 1mum i . e . , 
(3. 6) 
The vacuum ener gy density at the or 1g1n or "symmetric" m 1n 1mum is 
just V (O) = o. Finally, the potential must possess a local maximum 
near the ori gin. Its position is solved to be at

Let us now determine under what conditions we have inflation.

In this 
case, we have

is useful to scale the parameters S, y, o by dimensionless quanti­
ties

where u remains the v. e.v. of the field ¢ at the global minimum.

us that y/6 :S 10-1 and S2/o ۅ 10-6 which is more typical of known

to be the motivations for primordial inflation41 ) 
As the v . e .v. 
of the field which drives inflation becomes larger than the GUT 
scale and moves towards the Planck scale fine tunings disappear 
while choices for couplings become more natural .

Before moving on to a specific model, it is important to note 
what happens to the magnitude of density fluctuations44) . The 
basic property that these perturbations are essentially scale­
independent remains intact . What we find, however, is that it is 
not longer the ¢4 coupling which governs the magnitude, but rather 
the cubic coupling S. 
We find that for the potential of the

In terms of S, we must require S

6 to have 
6p/p  10-4• This again is a very stiff requirement especially 
for µ << Mp. As we will see shortly, supergravity will ease this 
constraint as well as previous ones. 
As primordial inflation implies µ  Mp, we must ask ourselves 
if first order gravitational (FOG) effects will start to become 
important . 
Indeed, Planck time physics remains very uncertain. One 
possibility, however, is considering the effects of local super­
symmetry or supergravity . The hope , of course ,  is that eventually 
all quantum gravitational effects will be understood in the context 
of, for example, an N = 8 supergravity theory . 
In some , as yet 
unknown, way at scales at or below the Planck scale , one may be 
left, however, with a residual N 
= 1 supergravity theory. We will 
make, therefore, a large assumption; all FOG (and higher) effects 
are taken into account when one works in the context of supergra­
vity. 
In particular, gravitational interactions will be included 
by considering non-renormalizable terms in the superpotential45) and 
at scales below Hp we are left with a workable effective theory. 
To treat inflation in simple supergravity46) , let us start 
with the most general superpotential for a single scalar field, 
the inflaton ¢,

where m is an (as yet) unspecified mass parameter, M 
= Mp//STI and 
the Ai are all dimensionless coupling constants . From eqs . (2.4) 
and (2. 5), we can derive the effective potential and put it in the 
form (3. 3) . 
There will, of course, be terms higher than fourth 
order , but at scales ¢ << M we can neglect (?) these .  In order for 
the superpotential (3 . 19) to provide a satisfactory inflationary 
picture, we must insure that at the origin we have a true minimum 
and that there is a second minimum at (01¢10) = µwhich we will 
take to be equal to M. A supersymmetric minimum at M requires46)

s ingle choice for parameters of which many are possible and still 
give dens ity perturbations 6p/p v 10-4 .  Hence, we see that in the 
context of supergravity one can have an acceptable inflationary 
scenario without any severe adjustments to parameters . 
At this point, we must remember however, that although pri­
mordial inflation can solve the standard cosmological problems 
such as curvature, isotropy etc., it says nothing about the mono­
pole problem. Previously inflation was occurring during the SU (S) 
phase transition. 
In this case, because the number of GUMs per 
bubble is 0 (1) and we live in a single bubble , there is only about 
one GUM in our visible Universe. Primordial inflation is not 
associated with SU(S) and care must be taken with respect to the 
production of GUMs . 
In fact, the whole problem of breaking SU(S) 
and baryon generation is not trivial in the context of super­
symmetry. In the following section, I will look at this problem 
as well as the evolution of the Universe subsequent to primordial 
inflation. 
IV. 
SUPER-COSMOLOGY 
Globally supersymmetric theories , all have one thing in 
common; the lowest vacuum state is the supersymmetric one with 
zero vacuum energy47) . At zero temperature, supersymmetric GUTs 
may have several degenerate minima48) , e . g .  SU (S) , SU(3) x SU(2) x 
x U(l) , SU (4) 
x U (l) etc. all with zero vacuum energy density .  
Unlike gauge symmetries , supersymmetry is broken at finite tem­
perature4 9) due to the different spin statistics of bosons and 
fermions . As the yniverse cools ,  it may eventually choose a super­
syi!lIletric minima50 , ੻ut which one? 
In a non-supersymmetric GUT, at very high temperatures ,  generally 
only a symmetric minimum [e. g. SU(S)] exists . As the temperature 

18 
K. A. OLIVE 
drops , broken minima [e. g .  SU(J) x SU(2) x U (l) or SU (4) x U (l)] 
begin to appear. At a critical temperature ,  T , the value of the 
potential at both the symmetric minimum and brgken minimum are 
equal. 
(There may be more than one critical temperature . )  At 
lower temperatures , the broken minima drop far below the symmetric 
state and a phase transition occurs . What one tends to find48)੼in 
supersymmetric GUTs is that the symmetric state remains the global 
minimum as the temperature drops . 
In a zero temperature, exactly 
supersymmetric GUT, this state of affairs would (naively) remain 
until T = 0, hence the Universe would never be able to get out of 
the SU(S) phase .  One might hope that because supersymmetry must 
(somehow) get broken, things might change .  But in order to pre­
serve the gauge heirarchy, these effects should only be felt below 
Mw, thus making baryon generation practically impossible . 
Something else does occur, however . As the Universe cools , 
at some point SU(S) interactions become strong. 
Indeed, when one 
calculates the renormalization group equations for the SU(S) fine 
structure constant, a
=
 g2/4੽T, one can find48) that a "v 0 (1) at 
a temperature T "v nsu(S) "v 109-10 1 0 GeV. To see what happens as 
T approaches nsu(S) • one has to look at the form of the finite 
temperature effective potential 
\4.{¿) = 
(4 . 1) 
where Z is the 24 breaking SU (S) , c, can be derived from the super­
potential yielding V (Z ) and c2 > 0 is a constant depending on the 
particle content49) . At high temperatures , T > Asu (S) • SU (S) has 
many more light particle degrees of freedom than either SU (J) x 
x SU (2) x U (l) or SU (4) x U (l) and c2 (5) > c2 (3 , 2 , l) , c2 (4, l) . 
When T approaches nSU (S) ' the theory becomes "confining" and par­
ticle degrees of freedom being to disappear, thus lowering c2 (5) 
relative to the other states . At this point the phase transitive 
becomes possible. One may also arrange the Higgs sector in such 
a way as to make c2 (3, 2, l) 
> c2 (4, l) so that SU(J) x SU(2) x U (l) 
is actually preferred over SU (4) x U(l)51 ) . [This choice in fact 
is also pref erred from the point of view of generating a baryon 
asymmetry52) .J 
Although a transition is now in principle possible because 
the vacuum energy density of the broken state is lower than the 
symmetric one, a large barrier separating the two phases may 
prohibit the transition50 •53) . For example , if one starts with 
the most general (renorrnalizable) superpotential for the adj oint Z

and hence no transition occurs . 
In the context of global supersyrmnetry, this situation can 
be remedied by taking a very small value for both A and M5 1 ) . 
For small enough values , the barrier separating the broken and 
synnetric phases can be made arbitrarily small . 
In particular, 
we would like the barrier height to $ 0 (101 0) GeV so that strong 
coupling phenomena at a temperature of the same order could drive 
the transition. To do this ,  however ,  one needs41) ME ɂ Mw and 
A ɂ Mw/Mc· Although such an assignment is technically possible, 
it seems very unnatural and contrary to the desire to keep all 
couplings 0(10- 3-1) . 
It is at this point that supergravity and the use of non­
renormalizable terms can save us . 
Consider the superpotential 5 4)

(4. 6) 
where M = Mp//BTI and X and z are SU (5) singlets . 
The couplings 
a1 and a2 will be taken 0(1) . 
The third term in (4. 6) is needed 
to break local supersynnetry and will not be discussed here. The 
mass scale µ ɂ  Ms ɂ 101 0 GeV. Once again from eqs . (2.4) and 
(2. 5), one can derive the effective potential for the fields X 
and E .  Indeed, (4. 6) was chosen so as to mimick the behaviour 
of (4. 2). When one solves for the various minima of the effec­
tive potential one finds that in fact the SU (3) x SU(2) x U (l) 
minimum is the lowest . Furthermore, it occurs when E takes the 
v. e.v. 
(4. 7) 
This is in reality a prediction of the GUT scale 
(4. 8) 
At this minimum, the field X has an expectation v7lue (X ) 
= 
= (µ/M) 3/4 M and gives a barrier height of (µ/M) 5 4 M ɂ 108 GeV.

Thus we have been able to reproduce the scenario in global super­
symmetry without small parameters by considering supergravity . 
To complete the model of the evo੾ution of the early Universe 
in N = 1 supergravity, there must still be a mechanism for genera­
ting a baryon asyrnmetry2) and a solution to the monopole problems) 
The solution to the monopole problem is rather simple in this case. 
Because the transition has been delayed down to T  ASU(S)  
 109-101 0 GeV, this is in effect the critical temperature for the 
SU (S) transition and the temperature at which monopoles are pro­
duced . Equation (1.5) would then say that

which is consistent with the cosmological limit . 
In fact, coupled 
together with the new inflationary scenario, primordial inflation 
and supercosmology might be the only way to get an observable 
number of monopoles . As monopoles will in general not be produced 
thermally, the standard new inflationary scenario 1 2 • 1 3) would pre­
dict only one monopole per visible region. 
To generate a baryon asymmetry is in general not quite so 
easy. Detailed calculations s s , s 5) of the baryon asymmetry produced 
in standard models , tend to show that a large asymmetry becomes more 
and more difficult as the scale at which the asymmetry is produced 
is lowered. 
In standard SU (S) one has s 5)

where s/k is the specific entropy, 6B is the net baryon number pro-

aH/MH 
is the ratio of the decay rate to the expansion rate at T

The observed baryon to photon ratio today is related to knB/s by 
(4.11) 
In the standard picture, if the lightest Higgs boson were to have 
a mass O(l01 s) GeV with a Yukawa coupling aH  10-4 we would have 
a suitable asymmetry knB/s  10-3 6B. 
In supercosmology, however, to have any chance of generating 
an asymmetry at 10 1 0 GeV one needs Higgs bosons with masses of that 
order that have baryon number violating interactions . 
In a non­
supersymmetric theory, this would result in a (too) low asymmetry 
knB/s  4 x 10-8 6B . 
In supersymmetric models , the situation at 
first sight seems even worses 7) . The increased number of particle 
degrees of freedom and larger couplings along with dimension 5 
operators 3 0) , drive things towards e੿uilibrium and not away from 
it . Naively, one might then expects ) the baryon asymmetry to 
become negligible in supersymmetric models with 10 1 0 GeV Higgs es .

This approach does not take into account a possibility which is 
available ,  i . e. to couple the H and H to an SU (5) singlet 5 1 ) . 
In 
this case, one can show that it is relatively simple to get a large 
asymmetry with low mass Higgses in supersymmetry. 
To complete the scenario, consider the superpotential 54• 58)

It 
should be stressed that this value is not the result of fine tunings 
or small coupling constants , but rather a judicious coupling of a 
singlet5 1) and the use of non-renorrnalizable interactions 5 4 • 58) 
Finally, it is interesting to note, that without any extra 
effort, the gravitino problern6 0) is also solved58• 6 1 ) . 
This 
problem arose6 0) when one realizes that gravitinos which decay only 
gravitationally, do so very late, and if sufficiently abundant, 
produce too much entropy, possibly ruining the successes of big 
bang baryosynthesis and/or big bang nucleosynthesis . 
If , however, 
the initial abundance of gravitinos were reduced by inflation for 
example, the problem could be avoided6 1 ) . 
In the above scenario , 
there is no gravitino problem for an inflaton mass m¢ < 10 1 5 Gev58)

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION 
What I have tried to show in the previous sections , is that 
supersyrnrnetry, supergravity and cosmology all fit very nicely to­
gether. The big bang model itself has been able to explain the 
observed expansion of the Universe, the existence of the microwave 
background radiation and the origin of the light elements through 
nucleosynthesis . Before the inception of GUTs , it was not able to 
give any clue as to why the present density is so close to the 
critical density while at the same time being so old . 
It was also 
not able to explain the high degree of isotropy nor the small ob­
served baryon asymmetry. 
It is by now no secret that GUTs have 
radically changed our understanding of the very early stages of the 
Universe. Baryon number violating interactions led to the solution 
of the baryon asymmetry, while postulating the existence of a past 
inflationary period can solve many of the remaining problems . Not­
withstanding, the monopole problem and gravitino problem created by 
GUTs and supersymmetry can also be solved in the same framework. 

PRIMORDIAL INFLATION AND SUPER-COSMOLOGY 
23 
What I have not discussed up until now is the value of the 
cosmological constant. Herein lies a remaining cosmological prob­
lem, perhaps even more severe than previous ones . Why is the cos­
mological constant so small? Put in dimensionless form, we know 
that in order that the expansion today is not dominated by A we 
must have 
Q-\: 
ʖ 
Mp

l o  
(5 . 1) 
Surely an astounding piece of fine tuning if there ever was one. 
The trouble is we cannot even say that this was an initial condition 
which stayed there. Each vacuum phase transition leaves a change 
in the value of A. 
N = 8 supergravity6 2) generally begins with 
A &  -Mi (an anti-De Sitter space) . 
This very large negative some­
how must have become very positive j ust around the Planck time (if 
we want to keep the inflationary scenario) . Whether or not this 
change was due to the breakdown of the higher supersymmetries by 
the formation of condensates is as yet unknown. 
In the present 
model, the inflationary epoch begins with A/M' & 10- 1 2 (a long way 
away from its present value) . At the GUT phase transition A would 
have been down already to A/Mi & 10-40 • The next change might 
have been at the SU(2) x U (l) transition which saw A/M(  10-68 
followed perhaps by the quark hadron transition which left an 
effect, A/M)  10-80 until somehow it arrived at its present 
value (5 . 1) .  This can not be an accident. 
Is there a symmetry 
which guarantees a low value today? This question remains a still 
unanswered goal for cosmology . 
Apart from the cosmological constant , (which is tuned here to 
be zero today) , the model presented appears to be devoid of problems 
involving small parameters or fine tunings . 
There have, of course, 
been other attempts at supersymmetric inflationary6 3) and GUT 
scenarios 6 4) , most)notably, those which are based on the reverse 
hierarchy scheme6 5 
• 
Thes e  scenarios have many features in common 
with this one (e .g. flat potentials) but seem to fail to produce 
an acceptable picture after inflation. General difficulties with 
this type of model will be discussed elsewhere6 6) 
The main fea­
tures introduced in the present model are i) at high enough 
energies (>> Ms) , supersymmetry appears to be exact and we may do 
away with radiative corrections ; and ii) the extensive use of non­
renormalizable terms leading to effective interactions at scales 
lower than Mp• 
If supergravity is on the right track for unifying 
gravity with s tandard gauge interactions , then it should not seem 
surprising that a variety of small parameters previously not under­
stood, stem from these non-renormalizable terms which scale with 
inverse powers of Mp. 
One can only be optimistic, that the so-far 
rapid success of applying supergravity to GUTs and cosmology is just 
beginning.

1 .  INTRODUCTION 
These last years fascinating speculations on the consequences of 
phase transitions , within the context of Grand Unifiec Theories , 
in the early universe have been set forth and "predict" numerous 
phenomena which might occur at temperatures as high as 1015GeV . . .  
a temperature far beyond present experimental possibilities . 
Moreover , although Grand Unified Theories do represent a natural 
generalization of the presently admitted theories ( essentially , 
the Weinberg-Salam model and Quantum Chromodynamics ) they unify 
theories whose experimental basis is not as rich as it should be 
( think to the Higgs ' particles , for instance ) ,  whose theoretical 
content is far from being understood ( e .g .  the basic problem of 
quark confinement is as yet unsolved) ; where calculations are 
quite difficult to work out , owing to an intrinsic non-linearity , 
and hence to be compared with high energy experiments ; and , fi­
nally , where approximations are not undercontrol . 
However , at a less - slightly less - speculative level , one 
may consider the state of matter at densities and/or temperatures 
more in accordance with what is known at our laboratory scale :

in the early universe this would involve temperatures ranging from 
Ï . 1  GeV to Ï 100 GeV . 
At these temperatures and/or densities the hadrons become 
gradually close-packed ( fig . 1 )  and next transform into a quark 
soup or , in more elegant words into a hot quark plasma . 
This transition from hadrons to quarks ( i . e .  going back in 
time ) is generally assumed to be a phase transition and more speci­
fically a first order phase transition ( fig. 1 ) . Needless to say 
that it could well be that there does not exist any such phase 
transition whatsoever : think , for instance , to the analogy with 
the ionization process of a neutral gas ; all thermodynamic quan­
tities vary continuously from the atomic state ( Ï  haQrons ) to the 
plasma state (Ï quarks ) and there is no phase transition at all .  
It should be clear that , in order to get a definite and con­
vincing answer to this question , the basic theoretical problems of 
Quantum Chromodynamics must be solved. Therefore , we have to assum.:_ 
the existence of such a first order phase transition . 
The usual way to handle such a transition consists in calcu­
lating the equation of state of the quark plasma , tʁe equation of 
state of the hadron phase (with another set of theoretical assump­
tions ) and finally link both curves via a Maxwell plateau ( equali­
ty of pressures and chemical potentials in both phases ; see 
fig. 2 ) . 
The essential interest of phase transitions in the early uni­
verse - but not the only one - lies in the fact that they are asso­
ciated with violent fluctuations which might subsequently be at the 
origin of galaxy clusters or , more modestly , of galaxies , or even 
more modestly , of stars beolonging to the so-called "population III" 
or , at least, "seeds" for an eventual creation of galaxies ( in the 
latter case , the mechanism for such a creation remains to be found ; 
see e . g .  ( 1 ) . 
It follows that two main problems are to be considered . The 
first one deals both with the critical temperature at which the 
transition occurs ( or ,  equivalently , at what time it occurs ) and 
also with is duration . It is clear . indeed , that one cannot create 
objects more massive than the mass contained inside the horizon : 
hence , the size of the horizon and the energy density at the time 
of the transition play a basic role . Furthermore ,  the duration of 
the transition determines in part the possibilty for the fluctu­
ations to grow sufficiently . The second problem deals with the 
spectrum of the fluctuations , a quantity generally put by hand at 
the onset of galaxy creation models . 
To these two main problems we should also add the question of

the nucleation of droplets of hadrons (possibly by "impurities" ; 
see e .g .  ( in another context ) ( 27) in the quark plasma during the 
phase transition and also their dynamics . 
Surprisingly enough the number of articles devoted to quarks 
in the early universe is quite limited , and particularly those 
which are connected with the quark/hadron phase transition . They 
deal either with a zero-temperature universe ( 3 ) , ( 4)1 or with 
the standard model ( 5 )  and , in the latter case the quarks may be 
partially confined ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8 ) , ( 9 )  and ( 10 )  or fully confined 
( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , ( 14 )  and ( 15 ) . 
In this talk , all these questions will be considered and dis­
cussed in a phenomenological way , the only reasonable one - in our 
opinion - when taking into account the present status of the theory . 
More specifically , we shall be concerned essentially with Olive ' s  
approach . 
2 .  DYNAMICS OF QUARK SYSTEMS 
Quantum chromodynamics is generally considered as being the correct 
theory of strong interactions and , as a matter of fact , it is quite 
consistent with present day experiments . However , owing to its in­
trinsic non-linearity calculations are very difficult to perform . 
Also , its vacuum structure is not yet understood and , more speci­
fically , the confinement mechanisms of quarks and gluons are still 
unknown . Thence the thermodynamics of the quark/hadron plasma can­
not be obtained directly from Quantum Chromodynamics as long as its 
theoretical problems remain unsolved . 
Of course , preliminary calculations performed within pertur­
bative expansions2 l have been carried out either at T=0°K ( 17 ) , ( 18 ), 
( 19 ) , or at finite temperatures ( 20) as to the quark phase . At T=0°K 
the calculations have been pushed to the fourth-order in the coup-
1 ing constant while at T ہ 0°K only the third order has been ob­
tained . Unfortunately , these last results are not particularly con-
clusive the more so since the various terms of the perturbative ex­
pansion are of the same order of magnitude , a circumstance that 
casts some doubts on the convergence of the expansion . Moreover , in 
the absence of an admitted confinement mechanism , the hadron phase 
cannot be properly described within this perturbative frame-work . 
Let us add that non-perturbative effects have tentatively been 
considered ( 21 )  but the matter is still in a controversial state . 
Consequently , if one wants deriving some results in view of 
astrophysiqcal situations - neutron stars , quark stars , quark era 
in the early universe - one must resort to some tractable phenomeno­
logical_ model . Such a model should contain both theoretical ingre-:--

dients from Quantum Chromodynamics and also some experimental input 
such as , for instance , a description of confinement . 
Among the various phenomenological possibilities at hand , we 
should mention various bag models and , mainly , the MIT bag model 
(22 ) . Nevertheless , they are generally as difficult to handle as 
the original quantum chromodynamics. However ,  and in spite of some 
attempts ( 23 )  it is extremely difficult to evaluate the density and 
temperature dependence of the bag because , precisely , of the absence 
of a convincing model of quark confinement 
2 . 1 .  The quark-quark potential 
The dynamical models considered - at a phenomenological level - in 
this paper are based on the use of an ɾ'!_ hoc potential V(r) . Indeed, 
the hadron spectroscopy is quite reasonably well described with a 
potential ( except the pion mass , of course ) inserted in a Schrodinger 
- like equation . Usually , the parameters of the potential are fitted 
so as obtain the ɿ-family and the result is next checked on the 
Y-family and then applied to other hadrons . In this way , the phenom­
enological potential adopted is tested between rnughۂy . 1  fm and lfm. 
Numerous potentials can be found in the litterature and some of them 
are listed in Appendix A. 
These phenomenological potentials generally contain essen­
tially two terms : one of them is supposed to take account of quark 
confinement ( it is an ever increasing function of the radial coor­
dinate r ; for instance a power law) while the second one may cor­
respond to the one- gluon exchange in the static limit. 
One of the most popular choice is 
( 1 )  
where a and b are positive constants to be fitted with the use of 
+ 
the charmonium spectrum and where the eight matrices A .  are the 
well-known Gell-Mann matrices ( the index i ,  in t 
or fn r 
, refers 
to the i-th quark ) .  It is sometimes called the "QCd potential6 since its 
Coulombian part corresponds to the one gluon exchange ( in this case , 
a is the QCD fine structure constant ) while the linearly rising term 
- the confining potential - seems to be suggested by lattice calcu­
lations (or simulations ) .  
It should be noticed , however , that the confining part of this 
potential ( or of other ones ) is a little bit pathological . First , 
the t1 . t2 matrix has opposite signs when the quarks 1 and 2 are 
either in a singlet or an octet state , resulting in the absence of 
a zero of energy in this last case ( i . e .  when the coefficient of r 
is negative ) .  Perhaps more important is the fact that , in the singlet 

THE QUARK-HADRON TRANSITION IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE 
35 
state case , arbitrarily high energies can be reached resulting in 
pair creations and hence in a softening of the potential , not so 
simple to handle . A supplementary drawback of the confining term is 
that it leads to unobserved van der Waals - like forces between 
hadrons ( 24) . For instance , a linearly rising potential would lead 
to long range forces in l/r in nuclear matter . 
Consequently , we should be cautious while using such potentials 
and specially at low densities. 
An improvement of the potential ( 1 ) , whose Fourier transform 
is 
u<kl 
( 2 )  
(c being a numerical constant) ,  has been performed by Richardson 
( 25) ( see also ( 26 ) ) who replaced the QCD fine structure constant a 
by the effective one obtained from the renormalization group , i . e .  
by

where nf i s  the number of quark flavours that come into play at 
momentum k and where /I. is a scale parameter to be determined by 
experiment ( and this is not an easy task . . .  ) .  This procedure has 
the advantage of embodying the important proɺerty of asymptotic 
freedom, an important theoretical and phenomenological ingredient . 
Finally , a simple interpolation between the two regimes ( low k 
and large k )  leads to

Such a potential has been used by Schoberl (27 )  to obtain the hadron 
spectroscopy . 
Once a potential is chosen and its free parameters fitted with

2 . 2 .  Quark masses 
The next dynamical question to be discussed is the one of the quark 
masses . Which one should be introduced in the Schrodinger equation ? 
Is it the constituent mass ( most authors ) ? the current mass ( ( ll ) ,  
( 12 ) , ( 15) , .etc . . .  ) ? the running mass (8) ? In fact there is no 

36 
R. HAKIM AND S. COLLIN 
clear answer and the problem is quite delicate and complex .  This 
is the reason why , in Appendix A ,  the potentials given are gener­
ally accompanied with the masses used in the fitting of the para­
meters . 
In our opinion , in order to be consistent with e . g .  the QCD 
potential ( 4 )  - where results arising from the group renormaliza­
tion equations have been inserted - the running mass should be 
used , perhaps in such a way as to reduce to the current mass at 
high momenta and to the constituent mass at low momenta . 
In fact, the renormalization group equations ( see e . g. ( 28 ) ) 
provide such a running mass ; unfortunately , they provide asymptotic 
forms only (exactly as for the effective coupling constanti-and ,ʂ-ɹ 
moreover , they have !wo solutions . One of them is

The fact that the renormalization group equations provide asymptotic 
forms only renders extrapolations to low momenta somewhat doubtful , 
owing to the fact that this corresponds to the non-perturbative 
region where our present knowledge fails . However , near p "' o ( or 
a few hundred MeV) and at a phenomenological level , m ( p )  is prac­
tically constant , at least as a kind of average ( see fig . 3 ) . This 
property is valid for the range of energies where the predicted 
spectroscopy of hadrons is correctly described . For instance , for 
the Richardson ' s  potential ( 4 ) , the constituent mass appears to be 
a valid approximation for a few hundreds MeV . 
To these considerations let us also add that non-perturbative 
effects , such as instantons , lead to other forms for m ( p )  ; for

2 . 3 .  Discussion and possible impɼovements 
R. HAKIM AND S. COLLIN 
( 9) 
We first notice that most of the potentials used in the littera­
ture coincide more or less between . lfm and 1 fm , i . e .  where they 
are actually tested ; more specifically , in the region where the 
potential is approximately linear . This might perhaps be an indica­
tion that at low densities such a phenomenology of dense matter 
could possibly contain some truth 
However , at higher densities - of the order of "' ( 1/ . 2fm) 3 -
where the various potentials deviate from each other , different 
results can be obtained . 
On the other hand , this approach suffers from a number of draw­
backs which mɽy be more or less cured . 
( 1 )  At high densities or equivalently , at short distances or at 
high momenta, relativistic effects should be taken into account and 
thus a Schrodinger equation approach is not adequate : a static 
approximation has to be corrected . This can be done either by 
taking account of relativistic corrections ( 30 )  or writing a two­
body Dirac equation for semi-relativistic quarks ( 31 ) . Among many 
other possibilities , it is also possible to write a Bethe-Salpeter 
equation ( in the ladder approximation) where the gluon propagator 
is replaced by

(where k 
= 
w - k , in equation ( 10) ) and where the vertex is re-
placed by an "effective" one , i . e .  where a is in fact aeff(k2 ) as 
given by Eq. ( 3 )  above . 
( 2 )  As important as the preceding point is a possible depen­

; similarly , the same authors have calculated in 
a non-perturbative way ( as a self consistent solution of the Dyson -

simple Fourier transform of the latter quantity gives the potential 
and its density/temperature dependence .

However, these attempts and several others are not yet completely 
conclusive . 
( 3 )  Another importar1t problem linked with the passage from the 
non-relativistic case to the relativistic one , is the following . 
When one considers the Coulomb - like part of the potential ( 1 ) , 
for instance , it should be considered as the fourth-component of the 
gluon field ( it corresponds to the static limit of the one-gluon 
exchange term of a perturbative expansion) .  
On the other hand , it is well known that either a Lorentz -
scalar potential or a four-vector potential lead to the same kind 
of non relativistic limit. Consequently , if the potential is to be 
considered as the fourth component of the gluon field Aµ , it must 
enter the relativistic equation under consideration through the 
gauge invariant combination 
( 13) 
while if it is a scalar , it must ap_pear in the mass term as 
m + 
m + gV , 
( 14) 
assuming as usual a Yukawa - like coupling with the quark field . 
To these two possibilities , one should add a third one , which 
is intermediate : the confining potential might be a Lorentz-scalar 
to be inserted in the quark mass as indicated in Eq. ( 14 )  while the 
"interacting" part - the gluonic one - should be considered as the 
fourth component of a four-vector . 
These three cases may be summarized in the following three 
expressions for the relativistic energy

( 17) 
( intermediate case ) . 
As to this last point - considered by Boal et- al . ( 1 5 )  - it 
should be noticed that a scalar field is introduced-ab initio in 
the SLAC bag model ( 34) or in a simplified version ( 35) and that its 
treatment is certainly simplier than the use of the hamil tonians ( 16 ) 
or ( 17) . However , despite the pseudo-Thomas-Fermi calculation of 
Boal et al . (15) , it leads to partial confinement only ( 36 ) , ( 37 )  ; 
see also (38 ) : quarks appear to be heavy at low densities and light 
at higher ones . In any case , if a scalar field is introduced so as 
to mimic confinement , it should be considered as the result of a 
complex process ( interactions with scalar gluonic modes ? )  sterning 
from Quantum Chromodynamics . 
3 .  STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE QUARK PLASMA 
If the dynamical approach considered above were completely correct 
and trustworthy , we should eventually find the thermodynamical 
parameters that characterize the (possible ) phase transition from 
hadrons to quarks . This would demand a proper treatment of two­
body and three-body correlations . Usually two-body correlations can 
be handled although with technical difficulties while three-body 
correlations can be treated - in a non quantum framework - only in 
quite particular cases . Needless to say that this is an almost im­
possible task in this context . However , one might perhaps think of 
these three-body correlations as already included , at least by part , 
in the phenomenological confining potential ? Furthermore ,  while 
three-body forces appear to play an extremely small role in hadron 
spectroscopy , at the temperatures where the transition is supposed 
to take place ( . 280 MeV ) only few baryons ( . 3% according to 
Olive ' s  calculations ( 1 1 )  and ( 12 )  are produced . 
Therefore we are led - as other - to deal with the simplest 
tractable statistical approximations 
essentially mean field ap­
proximations such as Thomas-Fermi ' s ,  Hartree ' s  or Hartree-Fock ( see 
e .g. (39 ) ) which are quite easy to deal with . Fortunately , these 
approximations are generally valid at high densities ( in the Quantum 
Chromodynamic case , the validity of the Hartree approximation at 
high densities has been shown by E .  Alvarez ( 40 ) , leading thereby to 
a more or less correct description of the quark phase . As the density 
is lowered , this kind of approximation is less and less valid es­
pecially in the physically interesting region of the quark-hadron 
phase transition ( assumed to exist , of course ) .  

THE QUARK-HADRON TRANSITION IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE 
41 
It fol lows that the hadron phase presumably cannot be described 
from these quark dynamics and statistical approximations and another 
model must be used . This is at least as difficult as for the quark 
phase ( ! )  so that we shall use , for the sake of comparison , the 
very simple model considered by Olive ( 11 ) 1  ( 12 ) . ( Thomas-Fermi ap­
proximation for hadrons (mainly TI -mesons ) interacting via the ex­
change of various particles ( w-mesons as to the baryons ) ) .  
In this paper , where mean field approximations are used , a 
quark ( or an antiquark ) is moving freely in the average potential 
of the other quarks and antiquarks . As a consequence ,  one can get 
rid off all the A-matrices algebra since 
< U ( r )  > = < t1 . t2 V ( r )  > 
( 18 )  
simply reduces to the average q-q potential , owing to the fact that 
the system as a whole is in a color singlet state . 
3 . 1 .  Statistical description of the quarks 
Let us first consider the statistical state of the quarks , the gluons 
being dealt with later on . There are only five known flavors (u, d ,  
s ,  c ,  b )  and the corresponding quarks differ only by their masses 
( at the temperatures considered , only the u, d, s quarks play a role 
since mu 
. md 
. 350 MeV and ms 
 550 MeV , while me 
 1 . 5  GeV and 
mb 
. 4 . o  GeV) . 
Let us consider the species i 
its average occupation number 
is 
< n .  ( p )  > 
l 
1 
( 19) 
exp . [ S (  s . (p ) -µ ) ] +l 
' 
l 
where B 
= (kBT ) -l ; where µ is the chemical potential , which we 
take to be zero in the primordial universe , due to the fact that , 
at high temperatures ,  the quarks coming from the B ۀ 0 matter con­
stitute only a small "impurity" compared with the ones produced by 
the background blackbody radiation . In Eq . ( 19 )  s 
. ( p )  is the exci­
tation spectrum of the quasi-quarks within the medium . 
( 1 )  In the Thomas-Fermi approximation , first considered by 
Olive in this context , it reads

( 22 )  
(23) 
gQ = 2 (particle/antiparticle) x 2 ( spin) x 3 ( color ) 
(24) 
= 12 . 
Here two points are worth mentioning . 
First and unlike what was done by ( 1 1 )  and (12) , d should not 
necessarily be given by Eq . (21 ) . For instance , at extremely high 
temperatures , the quark density is simply proportional to the photon 
density ( there are only free particles in the medium and each of 
them contribute with the number of degrees of freedom they carry ) , 
i . e .  by 
where the photon density is given by 
n 
y 
a T3 
( 25 )  
(26 )  
( a  being the Stefan constant ) ,  so that we could take d as being 
12 
1/3 
d = ( gQa11) 
1 
T 
(27) 
In fact, Eqs . (21 )  and (27 )  represent two extreme cases : the low 
temperature case and the high temperature one , respectively . In 
fact , the correct screening factor d should be calculated from a 
study of the proper oscillation modes of the quark plasma . This is 
evaluated below . 
Next , in Eq. ( 22 )  or ( 25) only quark densities come into play :  
this is due to the fact that a given quark is sensible only to col­
or irrespective of the species considered in the interaction . How­
ever , this has been criticized by Boal et al . ( 15 )  who argued that 
gluon contributions ( and hence gluon density ) should be included in 
the evaluation of d .  Their argument essentially amounts to saying 
that since quarks feel colored states , gluons should necessarily be 

THE QUARK-HADRON TRANSITION IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE 
43 
taken into account . In fact, this argument rests also on their sta­
tistical treatment of gluons . Although it is perfectly right to 
argue that way , we shall take the opposite view for consistency 
reasons which we explain below . 
Finally , Eqs . ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) , ( 22 )  and ( 23 )  lead to the following 
self-consistent equation

Finally the whole thermodynamics of the guarks is completly deter­
mined in this approximation and it remains to evaluate the contri­
butions of the gluons . 
( 2 )  In the true Hartree approximation ( see e .g .  ( 39 ) ) ,  the 
average potential is given by 
< V(r) > 
( 37) 
which reduces to 
< V(r) >

I n  fact, the integral in this last equation does not extend to in­
finity but to the screening length d to be taken either from Eq. 
( 21 )  as Olive or from EQ:"--r27)as-wagnoner et al . ( 7 )  or rather in 
an intermediate way as is done below . 
When one takes Eq. (21 )  for d and in the high density limit 
n0 >> 1 ,  the last term of Eq. ( 39 )  can be written as

Up to the factor 3 ,  this i s  Olive ' s  assumption (actually , i f  one 
takes his assumption seriously , his potential energy is undeɷestiɸ 
mated by a factor 12 , corresponding to the number of quarks felt by 
a given quark ( i . e .  12 is roughly the average number of spheres 
tangent to a given one in an assembly of equal radius close-packed 
spheres ) ) .

These last equations show that i n  the Hartree approximation 
there is no need of any particular technique to deal with the double 
counting of the average potential energy . 
(3)  The next approximation which we consider in this paper is 
the Hartree-Fock one , because of the particular importance of ex­
change correlations at relatively low densities and/or temperatures .  
Also it has been proposed to deal with nuclear forces as the result 
of exchange forces between quarks (41 ) . 
In this case , the excitation spectrum is given by ( 39 )  the 
following integral equation 
t i ( p )  = 
t Ëartree ( p )  
'\, 
j d3p 1  V ( p ' -p )  . <ni ( p '  ) >  , \44 ) 
where V is the Fourier transform of the potential under considera-
tion . This self-consistent equation can be solved by iteration and 
the result is used in the calculation of the pressure and of the 
energy density . 
3 . 2 .  Statistical treatment of the gluons 
The statistical analysis given above for the quarks can be repeated 
mutatis mutandis for the gluons . In particular , in our mean field 
approximations , their occupation number < n (k) > is given by 
g 
< n (k) 
g

> = - ÏÐÑ 
exp . r riw(k) J - 1 
(45)

R. HAKIM AND S. COLLIN 
where w(k) is their excitation spectrum . From Eq. ( 45 )  the contri­
butions to pressure , energy density and gluon density are found via 
standard formulae ( one should also remember that there are eight 
kinds of gluons ) .  
The essential problem is thus the one of the derivation of the 
excitation spectrum w(k) . Olive ( 11 )  and ( 12 ) , and also Boal et al . 
( 15) , chase 
w(k) 
= l k l  + V(d) 
( 46 )  
which embodies the facts that ( i )  the gluons are massless and ( ii )  
they are interacting via the potential v ( the same as"the quark­
quark potential and with the same Thomas-Fermi approximation , in 
Olive ' s  article ; note that V 
= bd , the confining potential . in his 
paper ) which therefore contributes to the gluon enɵrgy w(k) by the 
factor V(d) . 
This approach can be questioned on several points . First, when 
considered inside matter , the gluons become massive , although one 
could distinguish ( see e . g .  ( 32 ) ) between an "electric" and a "mag­
netic" mass ( in fact, they are of the same order of magnitude ) . 
Next , the gluons do not appear as such within the medium but only 
as modes (or quasi-gluons or plasmons ) propagating in the quark 
plasma. 
\le are thus faced with two problems : ( i )  how to confine the 
gluons and ( i i )  how to calculate the modes ( i . e .  the dispersion 
relation ) of the quark plasma ? 
In fact , as to the first problem , there is no particular need 
to confine the gluons since they are just modes propagating in the 
quark plasma : if the quarks are confined (below a critical tempe­
rature ) there is no longer any possible modes ! Hence , no quarks 
implies no gluons . 
The second problem is much more difficult to deal with essen­
tially because of the lack of control of the approximations used . 
For instance , the Hartree approximation and the use of color singlet 
states as physical states lead to an excitation spectrum ( 37) sim­
ilar to the one of a quantum elctrodynamical plasma ( 42 )  and (43 ) . 
Other non-perturbative approachs provide other results ( 32 ) . In the 
spirit of the approach used by Olive or by Boal et al . ( 15 )  as well 
as in this article , we should actually use a spectrum derived from 
our dynamical model ; this would be consistent with what was done 
previously and does not present any technical difficulties . 
However , a common characteristic of most of the spectra ob­
tained is that they are of the form

where the plasma frequency w may differ slightly from model to 
model and also for "electricfl and for "magnetic" modes . Eq. (47 )  
may sometimes b e  a good approximation in the two limiting cases of 
long and short wavelengths . For the plasma frequency wp , instead of

Note also that there exists as many gluonic modes as quark flavors 
and , usually , with a third order degeneracy . 
Finally , we are in position to come back to the screening 
length d which should be derived directly from the quasi-gluons ex­
citation spectrum . In fact , K .  Kajantie et al . (32) found in their

which both behave as T 
, showing thereby that Eq. ( 27) is not a so 
bad approximation . A more phenomenological approach for cases inter­
mediate between the cold and the hot case is , more conventionally , 
( 51 )  
where Vth is a relativistic thermal velocity ( see e . g .  J . L .  Synge 
(44 )  or R .  Hakim et al . ( 45) ) .  
4 .  FLUCTUATIONS 
The calculation of fluctuations for various physical quantities of 
importance in cosmology , such as density or energy density ,  can be 

48 
R. HAKIM AND S. COLLIN 
performed in a particularly simple way within the framework of our 
mean field approximations . In particular , their spectrum can be 
obtained quite easily and also the typical coherence length asso­
ciated with them . 
Let us focuse our attention on the case of baryon number 
fluctuations or , equivalently , on the fluctuations of the quark 
density . Their spectrum <on2>w , k  can b e  obtained from the spectrum 
of the quasi-quarks , <on2>8 , k • propaɲating within the plasma and 
from its "dielectric" constant E ( w , k )  ( see e .g .  (46 )  and ( 39 )  ; 
the relativistic case has been considered by H .  Sivak (47) ) through

( 52 )  
( 53 )  
It should be noticed that this last equation actually contains two 
terms : one of them represents the coherent fluctuations , i . e .  of 
the plasma waves , corresponding to the implicit pole terms in the 
denominator I E ( w,k) I while the other one is nothing but the thermal 
fluctuations . The quasi-quark spectrum <on2>0 
is essentially a 
quasi-free fermian spectrum and has been calΉDʔated by H .  Sivak (47 )  
in the relativistic case as

Moreover , the o 
- term represents a vacuum term which has to be 
dropped in our ʓfienomenological approach . It can also be remarked 
that the term corresponding to i=l being a high frequency term can 
be dropped in our cosmological context since we are essentially 
interested in more or less static modes and/or low wave lengths . 
As to the calculation of the "dielectric" constant E ( w , k )  
there is no particular problem in this approach, and only relativ­
istic generalization ( 36 ) , (49 ) , of the usual calculation (46 ) , 
(48 ) , (39) must be considered . 
As a final remark we may notice that , if we admit T . D .  Lee ' s  
( 50 )  suggestions as to the confinement mechanism of a color dielec­
tric constant smaller than one in the hadron phase , then an enhance­
ment of the density fluctuations should result ( as shown an Eq. 52 ) ) 
in the transition region . This might be considered as an indication 
that the potential actually used leads to a confining phase transi­
tion , eventhough higher correlations were not dealt with . 
5 .  CONCLUSION 
The above discussion gives idea of numerous sources of uncertain­
ties occuring in the dynamics and the statistical treatment of the 
quark-gluon plasma : uncertainties on the "correct" quark-quark 
potential ( if any ) ; uncertainties on the quark masses ; difficul­
ties of a treatment of three-body correlations , etc . It should 
also be noticed that the hadron phase is as uncertain as the quark 
phase ! 
Consequently - still assuming the existence of a first order 
quark-hadron transition - it is not surprising that various calcu­
lations , resting on different assumptions , give rise to critical 
temperatures ranging from  150 MeV to 600 MeV ! On figure 5 we 
have plotted the pressure of the quark-gluon plasma versus the 
temperature and , for the sake of comparison the ideal gas case has 
been drawn . The "error bars" indicate ranges of pressure within 
which pass curves corresponding to different assumptions . Inciden­
tally , some of our curves stop at a given temperature ( of the order 
of 180 MeV to 250 MeV) where the self-consistent equation for n has 
no solution : they are indicated by dots and a hached region in the 
figure . These temperatures should not be interpreted as the criti­
cal temperatures we are looking for but rather as the indication 
of the breakdown of our statistical approximations . 
Finally , even this phenomenological approach does not give 
credible answers to our question ( as far as cosmology is concerned ) :  
this will be our (pessimistic ) conclusion .

ABSTRACT : 
We consider a system of two heavy (mass bigger than a few 
GeV) neutral leptons coupling only to the Z 0 neutral vector boson. 
The interaction may mix the two particles . We study the behaviour 
of that dilepton during its departure from chemical equilibrium 
at the very beginning of the Universe, assuming the standard hot 
Big-Bang model is correct . The present cosmic mass density of 
that dilepton is calculated. In order for this density not to 
exceed the upper limit of 5 10-3 1g . cm-3x (Hubble Constant) 2 , the 
50 km/s .Mpc 
dilepton mass is constrained . In particular, in the case of the 
quasi-antidiagonal coupling of the dilepton to the Z 0 , the dilepton 
mass would have to be greater than a lower bound of the order of 
15 GeV and the gap between its two components would have to be 
less than an upper bound of the order of 10% of the dilepton mass .

INTRODUCTION 
Modern cosmology and the standard Big Bang Model provide us 
a good mean to test high energy physics . At very early times , 
the Universe was so hot that matter was composed of its primordial 
constituents :  particles like photons , electrons , quarks . . .  
Among them, leptons and their spectroscopy continue to be an 
intriguing puzzle in particle physics . Some models predict heavy 
neutrinos associated with the known light ones . More recently 
supersymmetry gives birth to a new "zoology" , each known particle 
unfolding with its supersymmetric partner . In thi੶ paper we will 
focuse our attention on neutral heavy (mass larger than a few GeV) 
leptons . They only interact via weak interactions (gravitational 
ones are neglected) . They could be heavy neutrinos or super­
symmetric partners of gauge bosons or (and) higgs bosons . As they 
have not yet been detected in high energy accelerators and as the 
theory is unable to predict their mass ,  we use the standard Big 
Bang Model to derive mass bounds imposed by cosmological data like 
the mean mass density of the Universe . 
We denote by S such a particle . As it is neutral , its 
electric charge is zero . 
It does not interact via electromagnetic 
and strong interactions . 
It only couples to the Z 0 vector boson, 
responsible for weak interactions . We just start with one lepton 
S and we will recall the analysis done by Lee and Weinberg in 1 977 . 
The aim of this paper is to deal with a more complicated situation 
with two leptons S1 and S2 , and we will compare our results 
concerning a dileptonic system S1-S2 with those obtained in 1 977 
concerning only one lepton S. The coupling of S to the Z 0 is 
described by the following diagram: 
s

e 
12. Sin2ew 
The heavy neutral lepton S is left (nothing is changed if it is 
right) . 
ew is the weak angle . We have used sin28w = 0. 229 . 
We notice that S is stable . 
When the temperature of the Universe T is higger than the 
mass M of the lepton S, the population of S behaves like a 
relativistic gaz of spin 1 /2 particles . Basically, a detailed 
study of the behaviour of the S-population when the temperature

T dropps under the mass M shows that under the double action of 
an important freezing and dilution, the S-lepton is fossilized. 
Moreover we know the present value of its mass density and we can 
infer a limit upon its mass .  I MeV is roughly the temperature at 
which the rate of interaction of S with other particles becomes 
less than the expansion rate of the Universe .  So , as long as 
T > 0 ( 1  MeV) S is kept thermalized by collisions with v ,  e, . . .  
and is in thermal equilibrium. Moreover, as soon as T < M, the 
S lepton begins to disappear. We have assumed that it only couples 
to the Z 0 • 
So S annihilates only on a S, its anti-particle , in 
processes such as 
SS -+ H 
( I )  
where £ and £ are light fermions as v ,  e ,  µ , . . .  
The annihilation 
is mediated via a Z 0 gauge boson and the Feynman diagram responsible 
for it is shown here: 
s 
£ 
s 
light fermions as µ , e, . . .  
One has to keep in mind that we deal with a chemical reaction. 
A SS pair can give light fermions . 
But the reverse process does 
exist in the same time : a ££ pair of large sufficient energy can 
annihilate to give a SS pair. 
So the number density n of the S­
lepton relaxes toward its chemical equilibrium value n0 • n0 is 
got if the chemical reaction 
SS +-+ light-fermions ££ 
(2) 
is very rapid . Actually, n=n when the Temperature T is large . 
When T falls down M, the rate0of this reaction is getting smaller 
and smaller as n=no decreases due to annihilation. Suddenly, when 
T 
? O (M/20) = freezing Temperature Tf there are so few S leptons 
that the reaction is stopped. This is a good example of quenching . 
The number density n is frozen and, apart the expansion of the 
Universe, n does not evolve . The S lepton population goes out of 
chemical equilibrium. Therefore, as regards the behaviour of S­
leptons , the basic scenario is the following when the Temperature 
decreases : 
. T > Mass of lepton S .  T੷ S Eopulation is in thermal equilibrium 
and in chemical equilibrium: 
SS pairs annihilate but they are 
continuously recreated by ,reverse processes . The chemical reaction

larger than M, the S behaves like a light ultra-relativistic gaz .  
Tfreezing 
? O(M/20) < T < Mass of lepton S .  The chemical 
reaction ss-iI is always very rapid .  So s is in thermal and 
chemical equilibrium and n is always equal to n0 due to a very 
fast relaxation. Mass effects appear so n0=n falls down v੹ry 
rapidly .

chemical reaction SS +-+ i! .

As an example, for a mass of S of 5 GeV we have NA = 1 4 . 6 .  
(7) 
Finally the last term takes into account the reverse process 
£t + SS, responsible for the relaxation of n toward n° . 
Lee and Weinberg found that the present mass density of heavy 
neutrinos and antineutrinos can be very well represented by

We observe that the bigger the mas s ,  the smaller the mass density 
of the fossilized heavy S leptons . 
Thus a lower bound is inferred 
from the requirement that the S mass density cannot exceed the 
upper limit of 2 10-29g/cm3 . They found that the lepton mass 
would have to be greater than a lower bound of the order of 2 GeV. 
More recently, Gunn et al . estimated that, due to their big mass, 
the heavy S leptons would collapse around galaxies and that their 
contribution to the total mass density of the Universe would be 
approximately 10% only. From data analysed by Peebles , it appears 
that the Universe is quasi-flat . The new upper limit on Ps is now:

P. SALATI 
So the bound on the S mass is rather in the range 7-15 GeV than 
2 GeV .  
As many theories involve two heavy neutral leptons instead of 
one, we reanalyse the cosmological implication of their mass 
density. In the next section we analyse the different processes 
by which the two leptons interact with themselves and with light 
matter. We write the equation of evolution for their number 
density. 
In section 3 we analyse the way they decouple from 
chemical equilibrium for different kinds of coupling S-Z0-S. 
Finally in section 4 we discuss one model ; using our cosmological 
bounds and we conclude . 
2 .  
THE DILEPTONIC SYSTEM 
We consider now a dilepton S1 and S2 . Those are two neutral 
heavy leptons with mass M1 for S1 and M2 for S2 . The coupling 
between the S and the Z0 is given by the matrix Coup :

In section 3 we will consider the case E very small , when the 
coupling is quasi-diagonal . Then we will analyse the 'Bemocratic " 
case E=l . Finally we will take a quasi antidiagonal coupling 
matrix of the type

with E very small . 
But before, we analyse the different reactions arising from those 
couplings and we take matrix coup

In the case analysed by Lee and Weinberg, there was only one 
reaction to consider during the departure from the chemical 
equilibrium of the lepton S and the subsequent quenching . Now, 
due to the three different couplings S - Z 0 
- S , we have to take 
into account no less than eleven different processes . This fact 
motivated our analysis of the case in which two leptons and not 
only one are involved. We give a list of the reactions with the 
corresponding Feynman diagrams and the formula for the averaged 
product of the cross-section a and the relative velocity between 
initial particles v. 
All the reactions are exothermic .

exothermic reaction corresponds the reverse one, responsible for 
the relaxation of n toward its chemical equilibrium value no . The

THE DEPARTURE FROM THE CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
We explore now all the range of couplings of S1-S2 to the 
neutral weak Z 0 vector boson. We start first with a diagonal 
coupling matrix, we explore the intermediate situation of a 
"democratic" coupling, and we end with the most interesting 
physical case : the antidiagonal coupling. 
The quasi-diagonal coupling . 
In that case S 1 (S2) couples 
preferably to another S1 (S2) and the mixing interaction between 
S1 and S2 is suppressed by a factor E .  First of all , let E be 
equal to zero . We have no mixing at all and the only reactions 
still present in that case are the annihilations (a) and (c) . We 
remark that both S1 and S2 are s table particles . The dileptonic 
system behaves exactly as two independent neutral heavy leptons 
and the analysis of Lee and Weinberg is s till valid for each 
particle. The lower mass bound depends on the gap between S1 and 
S2 . We have two extreme situations : 
if M1 = M2 • The dileptonic system is degenerated and the final 
mass density of those leptons is twice that of each particle . 
Therefore the lower mass bound is raised by a factor 2° · 54 and we 
get : 
M2 > (50 km/s .Mpc) 
x 22 .0 GeV 
H 
( 1 3) 
if M1 >> M2 . 
The S1 lepton has a present mass density 
negligeable . All the final mass density is due to S2 . As S2 
annihilates much less rapidly than S1 , the present fossilized 
population is composed mainly of S2 neutral leptons . Therefore 
the lower mass bound is the same as before: 
M1 >> M2 > (50 Km/s .Mpc) 
x 1 5 . 0 GeV 
H 
( 1 4) 
Then let E and the mass gap 6m between S1 and S2 be non zero. We 
have now a rather different situation than before . The main 
differences come from reactions (d) and ( e) .  S1 is no more stable: 
it can decay into S2 and a t I  pair and it can also scatter upon 
light fermions to give a s2 . Those two processes depend on E and

This configuration has yet been 
If we consider a small gap ( IO MeV) and E equal to I o-3 , then 
2 . Io-3 as in fig . 2-a and b the only effect is the scattering (e) . 
A lifetime of the order of 20 minutes prevents the decay to be 
important. The curves show that after a noticeable conversion of 
S1 into S2 there is a quenching. Basically, as long as there are 
important quantities of light fermions and S1 leptons , the change 
of S1 into S2 works . But the dilution of the light matter and the 
decrease of the number density n1 generate the chemical freezing 
of S1 . After some time, both S1 and S2 populations are fossilized. 
Notice the decrease of the frozen value of n1 /T3 as the mixing 
coupling E increases . On the other hand if E is very small as in 
Fig. I (Io-4) and if the mass gap is important : ʍm = 500 MeV, the 
scattering is suppressed but the decay plays a crucial role . 
S1 
leptons disappear completely after some time of the order of 
the lifetime of S1 as is shown in fig. I -a .  Generally, of course, 
both the decay and the scattering upon light fermions act at the 
saੳe time. The results lead us to make a few remarks : 
The elimination of S1 and the subsequent important decrease of 
its number density is actually a brutal phenomenon in ʍm and E .  
Due to relaxation, when the decay or the scattering become 
important, the n1 curve is pushed toward its chemical equilibrium 
value ny . When those processes play a crucial role, S1 remains 
in chemical equilibrium because very fast reactions connect it with 
light matter. 
Finally when S1 disappears rapidly, S2 remains alone and we 
still find the situation previously analysed by Lee and Weinberg: 
M2 
> 50 km/s .Mpc x I 5 .0 GeV 
H 
( I  5) 
Let us consider a "democratic" coupling between the S leptons . 
The coupling matrix is given by:

( I  6) 
It turns out that S1 is coupled very strongly to S2 . The situation 
can be easily analysed. We start with the extreme configuration 
M1 = M2 •

or (b) or (c) 
( 1 7) 
We remark that n1 = n2 = n/2 , in which n behaves exactly as the 
number density of the S neutral lepton considered by Lee and 
Weinberg. Despite the fact that we have actually two heavy neutral 
leptons , the present mass density of the Universe is the same as 
if we had only one particle . The lower mass bound remains 
unchanged. 
On the other hand, even for a tiny gap of mass 6m, reactions (d) 
and (e) are so important that S1 remains in chemical equilibrium 
and disappears very rapidly . 
S2 evolves lonely and we still find 
the by-now well-known configuration of one heavy neutral stable 
particule . Therefore the lower mass bound is always given by: 
M2 
> 50 kmÈs .Mpc x 1 5 .0 GeV

Finally we present a discussion about the most 
physical configuration: the anti-diagonal coupling.

S1 is 
coupled preferably to s2 . The mixing between the dilepton is 
strong, but the direct coupling S1-Z0-S 1  or S2-Z0-S2 is suppressed 
by a E factor . Therefore the decay (d) and the scattering (e) are 
predominant reactions owing to the chemical equilibrium of S1 and 
its fast elimination as the temperature dropps under its mass M1 . 
During the quenching of the S2 population, we have :

the first term refers to the dilution of the S2 population due 
to the expansion of the Universe. 
the second one describes the annihilation (and the reverse 
reaction) of a S2 upon its antiparticle . This process is very 
slow because of the £2 depen੭ence . For £ = 0 we have in fact no 
annihilation of a S2 upon a S2 at all . 
finally, the last term takes into account the annihilation of 
S2 upon S1 (and the reverse process) .  
First, we discuss the case £ = 0 .  The behaviour of n2 is 
shown during the departure from the chemical equilibrium in fig . 3 
for various values of the mass gap ʎm. 
It appears that the bigger 
the gap the more numerous the present s2 population. We also 
observe that even for a gap of 500 MeV and a mass of 5 .0 GeV, the 
S2 mass density largely exceeds the upper limit. Physically, when 
the temperature dropps under Mi , the number density of 81 begins 
to fall down. Then, when the temperature dropps under M2 , the S2 
become to disappear via the only allowed reaction: 
(b) 
The big problem for S2 is that there are so few S1 at that time, 
that the annihilation reaction (b) is slowed down noticeably and 
even stopped for very large gaps . This is actually a new situation 
because we can not only put a limit upon the mass of the S leptons 
but also upon the gap between them. The upper bound upon the mass 
gap is estimated very optimistically to be : 
ʎm = M1 - M2 2 10% M2 
(2 1 )  
for the bound upon M2 , we consider the exception to the rule :

For small gaps , nothing is changed .  The mixing interaction of 
annihilation (b) predominates . The upper limit upon the mass density 
of the fossilized S population is yet over-reached for ʎm = 500 MeV 
in the example of fig. 4 .  
For very large gaps (ʎm = 1 5  GeV) , we observe that the present 
mass density of the surviving s2 does not depend on ʎm and decreases 
when £ increases . Physically, for a large gap, reaction (b) is

exactly as if the mass M2 was renormalized to £2/3 M2 .

A PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODEL 
We apply our results to a class of supersyrnrnetric theories 
previously considered by John Ellis et al . .  In that kind of models 
they exist three heavy neutral heavy leptons coupling only to the 
Z 0 via the formula:

We define s: as the lightest particle . V1 and V2 are the respective

This is a quite high value for the mass of SÞ .  With a Hubble

We consider now the situation: 
We set 
E = very small number 
In that case the coupling matrix is quasi-antidiagonal and writes

(27) 
For small E values the S0 leptons annihilate only on the A0 still 
present at the time of their quenching. We can put a limit upon 
the mass of S0 : 
mass of SÞ > 50 kmÈs .Mpc 
x 27 GeV 
and also upon the mass gap between sڽ and A0 : 
mass of A0 - mass of sھ < 10% of the mass of sŽ 
(28) 
In that case the triplet of leptons (SÞ , s;, A0 ) has to be nearly 
degenerated. This result imposes severe constraints upon the mass 
matrix of the theory. 
As a conclusion we remark that the big difference between our 
analysis and that of Lee and Weinberg concern the quasi-antidiagonal 
coupling of a dilepton to the Z 0  vector boson. 
In that situation,

which is not so particular (supergravity imposes v1 to be closed 
to Vz) , the gap between the dilepton is severely constrained. 
Therefore, a quasi mass degeneracy of the dilepton is imposed by 
cosmology .

A review of the article : "Analytic Discussion of Spatially 
Closed F੮iedmann Universes With Cosmological Constant and Radiation 
Pressure" by R.C. and A. Grossmann is given. In this article we 
derive explicit formulae for various quantities of interest in the 
Universes described in the title ; we also discuss the interpreta­
tion of the cosmological constant in field theories .  The analytic 
results can be used in order to analyze large structures in the 
Universe . 
The purpose of this talk is to summarize the content of a 
paper written by A. Grossmann and myself, entitled : "Analytic 
Discussion of Spatially Closed Friedmann Universes With Cosmological 
Constant and Radiation Pressure", published in October 1982 in Ann. 
of Physics 1) . In a sense , the title by itself is a good summary 
but , the paper being quite long (around 60 pages ) ,  it is maybe use­
ful to give here a more detailed account of its content and to go 
through several chapters , summarizing the information available to 
the astrophysicist interested in cosmological problems . 
We consider Friedmann-Lemal:tre models with positive spatial 
curvature , with cosmological term 
h and radiation pressure . The 
evolution of the spatial radius of curvature R as function of t 
੯the cosmic time) is given by

the kinetic energy (dT/d1) 2 being non-negative , the associated 
mechanical system never penetrates under the curve V (T) ; see

are elliptic functions of order two . Therefore, from the analytic 
point of view, it is clear (because of Eq. (2) ) ,  that T(T) is in 
all cases an elliptic function of order two. Recall that elliptic 
functions generalize the usual trigonometric and hyperbolic func­
tions in the sense that they are meromorphic and doubly periodic 
in the complex plane . Usual trigonometric (or hyperbolic) func­
tions are recovered when one of the periods becomes infinite 
(this corresponds physically to the case where 
A 
is equal to the 
vertical co-ordinate of one of the extrema of the curve Va(T) 
(Figs . 1, 2 ) ) .  
Elliptic functions of order two (which take two times all 
complex values in a fundamental periodicity cell) can be conve­
niently expressed in terms of the Weierstrass functions p ,  ੰ.  
a ; notice that only P i s  elliptic . Besides , any rational func­
tion of an elliptic function is elliptic . One of the purposes of 
the article 1) is to give analytic expressions for T(T) and re­
lated quantities - density function, acceleration function, etc . -
in terms of Weierstrass functions . This study is made in 1 ) for all 
possible Friedman Universes (for all choices of a and \) . 
For example, a Universe with a = 0 and 
A 
> 1 and starting 
with a big bang is described by the equations (see also Ref. 2 ) )  
T(T) = 6 [ P(T) + 112 J 
(4 ) 

80 
R. COQUEREAUX 
In these expressions , the Weierstrass functions are associated to 
a lattice whose periods can be expressed in terms of 
a and 
A .  
Here 'f is "the end o f  conformal time" ( i f  Tf i s  big enough -
at least more than 2n - a very old observer could see the 
back of his head ! ) .  However, when T + Tf, t + oo, such a Universe 
starting with a big bang expands for ever (as measured in cosmic 
time t ) .  Figure 3 shows the behaviour of T(T) ; only the first 
part of the curve , from T 
= 0 (the big bang) to T = Tf (the end 
of conformal time) is physically meaningful . According to Ref. 3 ) ,  
the three-dimensional distribution o f  quasars known to date shows 
a singular zone , about 200 Mpc wide , 3000 Mpc away, where no 
quasars are observed . For precise values of the cosmological pa­
rameters , this empty band , when analyzed in the above-mentioned 
Friedmann-Lemaitre model, appears like an equatorial band of the 
hypersphere 83 • The motivation for our work l) comes actually 
from the analysis made in Ref. 3) . 
A Friedmann Universe is determined by the two parameters a ,  
A ; a further dimensionless parameter To is needed to specify 
a time of observation (the present-day Universe ) ,  finally a scale 
Ac allows us to convert dimensionless quantities into centiwetres. 
Unfortunately, the measurable quantities do not coincide with the 
previous ones and one has to know how to express the former in 
terms of the latter . Appropriate changes of variables (with 
a #  0 and 
A #  0) are given in Ref .  1) . 
The red shift function z = T(T)/T(T ) 
1 considered as a 
function of T (parameter time of emitt΃r) for fixed 
T 
(para­
meter time of the observer) is also an elliptic function°of order 
two. Its expression is therefore analytically studied in Ref .  1) 
for all possible models .

We also study the following problem : suppose that an object 
X (a quasar) is analyzed by an observer T (the earth) which 
records its red shift ; let P be another observer, what is the 
redshift of X as recorded by P? This kind of "red shift trans­
formations" involves not only the relative positions of 
X, T and 
8 ( i .e . ,  the geometry of 83 ) but also the dynamics of our Uni­
verse ( i .e . ,  the Friedman equations) .  For example , let X be a 
quasar sitting on an equatorial 82 sphere of S3 with respect 
to a pole P, zp its red shift as recorded by P and ZT its 
red shift as recorded by an observer T .  Then,

Here we restrict ourselves to the case of the Universe already des­
cribed by Eqs . (4 ) .  In this relation, Q,p denotes the cosmic 
latitude of T with respect to the pole P and 
S is the sighting 
angle between the pole P and the quasar x ; the Weierstrass o 
function is of course associated to the lattice characterized by 
the value 
A of the reduced cosmological constant . 
This kind of relation allows one to study large scale struc­
tures of space-time ; if there is any regularity in the large scale 
repartition (or motion) of matter in the Universe , this regularity 
can only be "seen" by very particular observers (in the same way, 
the regular elliptic motion of the Halley' s  comet, which could be 
seen like an ellipse from above the sun's north pole ,  looks like a 
spiraling path against the winter heavens ! ) .  
Using Eq. (5 ) and the values of the cosmological parameters 
given in Ref. 3 ) ,  one may recover the observed direction-dependent 
gap in the repartition of quasars 3) . 
Friedmann' s  equation can be, of course ,  inte8rated numerically , 
However, the development of small programmable pocket computers 
raakes now possible the direct cor·1putation of interesting quanti­
ties by using explicit formulae (this is also a further motivation 
for our study) . The Weierstrass functions are usually not tabu­
lated , for this reason we give also in Ref. 1 )  several methods for 
evaluating these functions . 
A lattice in the complex plane can be characterized either by 
its periods w , wi or by the so-called Weierstrass invariants 
g2 , g3 , the r΂lation between these two couples of values being 
an integral relation. Depending on which couple of values is

known, one or another method should be preferred and we discuss 
in Ref .  1) several possibilities . 
Tables are also available in microfiche form from the 
author for a wide class of models. 
The last topic discussed in Ref. 1) is the significance of 
the cosmological constant in quantum field theories . The basic 
idea is that 
A measures the energy of the vacuum ; by "vacuum" 
we mean the lowest state of the field configuration (this is remi­
niscent of the zero-point energy t ڶW of the harmonic oscillator) .  
We discuss therefore the analogy between A and the vacuum energy 
of electromagnetism (Casimir effect) .  Then we analyze the role of 
A from the point of view of spontaneously broken gauge theories 
(in the Weinberg-Salam model and in grand unified theories , GUT) . 
We also give some information about the analysis made in super­
symmetric theories .  Our purpose , in the last part of the paper l) 
is not to present new ideas but mainly to guide the reader among 
several aspects of this problem. 
Another interpretation of the cosmological constant (not 
discussed in Ref .  1 ) )  appears if one wants to embody general re­
lativity and non-Abelian gauge theories in a unique formalism of 
the Kaluza-Klein type . The basic idea is the following : we as­
sume that we live in a (4+d) dimensional Universe E endowed 
with a metric invariant under a group G of isometries . Under 
some general assumptions (see, i .e . ,  Ref. 4 )  for precise details ) ,  
E can be written as a local product M S where M i s  interpre­
ted as space-time and S is an "extra-dimensional world" also 
called "internal space" that we do not see because the typical 
dimension of S (usually assumed to be compact) is very small 
(typically lo-32 cm) .  The scalar curvature RE of our (4+d) 
dimensional Universe E can be written, because of G invariance , 
as a sum of contributions involving only M. Roughly speaking, if 
one assumes that the shape of our internal space S is constant 
when one moves in space-time M, we obtain 
RE 
= R11(x) - l Tr(F (x) •F]JV(x) ) + RS 
" 
11 
RM(x) 
is the scalar curvature of space-time and describes gravity 
the second term is the Lagrangian of gauge fields associated with 
the group G and generalizes the Maxwell Lagrangian ; the third 
term describes the scalar curvature of our internal space and can 
be identified with the cosmological constant.

We classify massive stable collisionless relics of the Big 
Bang into three categories of dark matter: hot, with damping mass 
about supercluster scale; warm, with damping mass of galactic or 
cluster scale ; and cold, with negligible damping . 
The first 
objects that form in universes dominated by hot and warm relics 
are pancakes .  Coupled one-dimensional N-body and Eulerian hydro­
dynamical simulations follow the nonlinear evolution of pancakes , 
the separation of baryons from dark matter via shock formation 
and the evolution of the shocked gas by conduction as well as by 
cooling. We sketch a simple analytic theory based upon the 
uniformity of pressure over the shocked region which accurately 
describes our numerical results . Only ƣ10-20% of the gas cools 
sufficiently to fragment on sub-galactic scales in neutrino­
dominated (hot relic) theories . Cooling is efficient for warm 
relics . 
In all cases, the typical fragment size is ƣ109-101 0 M

1 .  CLASSIFICATION OF DARK MATTER CANDIDATES 
Stable collisionless relics of the Big Bang are perhaps the 
most attractive candidates for the dark matter . Bond and Szalay 
( 1 983) have classified the possibilities into three basic types 
defined by their background velocity dispersion: relics may be 
hot, warm, or cold. 
The canonical example of a hot relic is a 
massive neutrino, with velocity dispersion 6 (m /30eV)-1 ( 1 +z) km s-1 .

However, any particle which is massive, stable and decouples when 
relativistic at an epoch when the temperature of the universe was 
΁ Tqh cu 200 MeV is a hot particle. Any particle which decouples 
at a temperature above Tqh is warmઃ with velocity dispersion 
0.085 ( 1 00/g(Td) 1 13 (1 keV/rrsc) km s- . Here, we call our hypothetic­
al collisionless relic X, and fix is its mass ; g (Td) is the effective 
number of degrees of freedom at the X-decoupling temperature, Td. 
The quark-hadron phase transition temperature, Tqh> is the 
approximate decoupling boundary between warm and hot since above 
Tqh the number of relativistic species present is large due to all 
the liberated quark-antiquark pairs . At the neutrino decoupling 
temperature, Td cu 1 MeV, g is only 1 0 . 75 ,  whereas g ę 60 just above 
Tqh" Near electroweak unification at cu1 00 GeV, g cu 1 00 in the 
minimal Weinberg-Salam SU(2) ® U( 1 )  ® SU(3) theory . Near grand 
unification energies , cu101 5 GeV, g cu 1 60 in the minimal Georgi­
Glashow (1 974) SU(5) theory . 
Supersymmetric theories increase g 
by only a factor of about two . 
The relationship between the density ઄arameter of relativistic 
decouplers and their mass is : ǽx = 1 . 1  h-
( 1 00/g(Td) )  i:ix/ 1 keV, 
where h is Hubble ' s  constant in units of 1 00 km s-1 Mpc-1 . For 
g = 1 0 . 75 ,  we get the usual 20-102 eV mass meeded for one species 
of massive neutrino to close the universe . The variation corres­
ponds to the range h = 0 . 5  to 1 .  For Td > Tqh' and for minimal 
theories ,  USc ѫ 2x102 - 2x1 03 eV is the mass required for ǽ =  1 .  
This mass could be much larger if : ( 1 )  there is no large plateau 
in g(T) - i . e .  no desert; (2) significant entropy generation 
occurs after Td - ǽx scales inversely with the entropy amplific­
ation factor. The first option could be restricted since the 
number of stable relativistic neutrino species at the time of 
primordial helium generation cannot be much greater than three to 
avoid overproduction (Schwartzman 1 969, Olive et al . 1 98 1 ) ;  this 
could translate into a constraint on the number of leptoquark 
families . The second option suffers from constraints on the 
allowable entropy generation after baryon synthesis . 
Hot particles have a damping scale arising from the cons­
tructive effects of gravitational attraction on large scales and 
the destructive effects of their random velocity on small scales : 
Md ѫ 3 . 4  mp3 /અ2 (Bond, Efstathiou and Silk 1980) , where 
» = 1 . 22 x 1 0  2 MeV is the Planck mass ;  this is of supercluster 
scale. Warm particles damp below the scale 
4/3 
Md ͦ 0 . 1 1  (mp3 /m/ ) ( 1 00/g (Td) )  
( 1 )  
(Bond, Szalay and Turner 1 982, Bond and Szalay 1 983) , which is 
either the scale of galaxies or of clusters depending upon h .  If 
rrsc is very large, due to either ( 1 )  or (2) , then the damping 
scale can be very small ,  and the particles are effectively cold. 
Indeed, we define cold particles to be those with almost no 

DARK MATTER AND SHOCKED PANCAKES

velocity dispersion, and which thus have Md z 0 .  Collisionless 
relics which decouple when they are nonrelativistic are examples . 
Preskill, Wise and Wilczek ( 1 982) have recently pointed out that 
oscillations of "classical" fields , i . e .  of boson vacuum expect­
ation values ,  can lead to a large time-averaged energy density, 
as well as to a rapidly fluctuating part . 
They claim that spatial 
fluctuations in the field have energy density growth identical to 
that of nonrelativistic decouplers . 
The canonical hot particle is the massive neutrino . Another 
candidate is the Majoran, a goldstone boson whose raison d '੦tre 
is to generate neutrino masses via spontaneous symmetry breaking 
(Georgi ,  Glashow and Nussinov 1 98 1 , Gelmin, Nussinov and Roncadelli 
1 982) . All background vv' s would annihilate into a sea of Maj orans 
- the temperature of which would be higher than that of the back­
ground photons . 
If they are massive, then m ڵ 1 0  eV is required 
in order to have n ੧ 1 .  This implies uncomfortably large damping 
masses · and, as we shall see, very little gas cooling in a Majoran­
dominited universe . 
Suggestions for warm relics have included 
the gravitinos and photinos of supersymmetric theories ,  and right­
handed neutrinos . Any of these could also decouple when non­
relativistic, and thus be cold . Heavy neutral leptons of the 
sort discussed by Lee and Weinberg ( 1 977) , primordial black holes , 
and monopoles are other cold relic candidates .  If strings form 
in phase transitions in the very early universe, and if they 
primarily exist as loops of subgalactic dimensions (Kibble 1 983) , 
galaxy formation in string-dominated universes will effectively 
follow the cold scenario . The model for classical field 
oscillation is provided by the axion (Preskill, Wise and Wilczek 
1 982) . 
In all cases in which relics form the dark matter, a remark­
able coincidence is required - namely that n and nB are not too 
dissimilar . We know that nB cannot be too s੨all ,  or else cooling 
on any scales would have been too inefficient . This is an anthropic 
argument which rules out extreme variations of nB . 
If n z 1 is 
required as a consequence of inflation (or simplicity) , and ffix 
is given by the particle physics, then H0 would be adjusted so 
that the nx Ǥ ffix h-2 relation is enforced for relativistic 
decouplers ; the coincidence nxǤ nB implies ੩Ǥ mN s-1 , where 
s C 109 is the entropy per baryon and mN is the nucleon mass .  In 
a simple model of baryon generation, this becomes 
II1z: Ǥ mN » mVB-1 aGUT Ecp • where mVB is the mass of the inter­
mediate vector boson responsible for baryon generation ,  aGUT is 
the fine structure constant at unification energies, and ECP is a 
CF-violating parameter . Why should such quantities be inter­
related in this manner? The case of nonrelativistic decouplers 
requires perhaps an even more stringent restriction upon the 
particle physics ,  namely that the freeze-out temperatures for the 
reactions which create X ' s  must be - within some narrow range - a

2 .  COOLING SCALE AND PANCAKES 
We have seen that the 11p3 ѩ-2 damping scale applies for hot 
and warm particles ; compare this with the mass scale of stars 
which is set by the combination ΀3 mN-2 = 1 . 9 M0 • Another scale 
at high mass enters into the determination of the fluctuation 
spectrum: the horizon mass at equipartition between relativistic 
and nonrelativistic constituents ,  which occurs at Zeq = 25000 Qh2 
when the photon temperature is T

An initially scale-free density spectrum evolves in the linear 
phase to one in which there is a sharp damping cutoff at masses 
smaller than Md, a strong flattening between ڴ and MHeq which 
then matches onto the original spectral shape above Mileq (Peebles 
1982, Bond, Szalay and Turner 1 982, Bond and Szalay 1 983) . 
It 
has been conventional to associate the appearance of voids and 
strings in the galaxy distribution with a large damping cutoff . 
An important unresolved issue is whether the shoulder below MHeq 
is sufficient to generate such structure . In any case, for warm 
and hot particles, the first structures to become nonlinear will 
be on the scale Md, will collapse preferentially along one axis , 
becoming highly asymmetric, and result in shock formation in the 
central regions (Zeldovich 1 970, Sunyaev and Zeldovich 1 972) . 
The first structures to collapse in the cold scenario may also be 
asymmetric and lead to shocks ; however, instead of a smooth 
collective inflow, the shocks may be more localized, arising from 
cloud-cloud collisions . 
Binney ( 1 977) , Rees and Ostriker ( 1977) and Silk ( 1 977) have 
demonstrated how galaxy masses may be related to a cooling scale . 
It is instructive to go through this exercise to demonstrate what 
must be done to get cooling in larger structures - from which 
galaxies ultimately arise. The Rees and Ostriker ( 1 977) develop­
ment yields

The ingredients which go into obtaining this scale are as follows .

However, the temperature T p M 
( 1 +zt) depends not only upon the 
mass ,  but also upon the epoch of turn-around, zt . 
Indeed, if zt 
is too large, Compton cooling should replace bremsstrahlung. 
In 
any case, stability can never be regained if T falls in the helium­
hydrogen recombination cooling regime . 
Since the ionization 
energy of helium is 2a2me, and the characteristic temperature for 
helium recombination is some fraction of this, we obtain the 
scale Mcool " 
There are 3 ways to increase Mcool : ( 1 )  raise zt 
into the Compton cooling epoch ; (2) utilize central condensation 
so that T can be lower in the central regions since the matter 
has less far to fall before shocking; (3) stretch the sphere into 
an oblate configuration so again the gravitational acceleration 
is less. Effects (2) and (3) operate in pancakes ;  Zt is cons­
trained by limits on the temperature fluctuations in the micro­
wave background, hence ( 1 )  cannot be pushed too far . 
3 .  PANCAKE SHOCK CALCULATIONS 
This work is described more fully in Bond, Centrella, Szalay 
and Wilson ( 1 983) , hereafter BCSW. Here, we outline the methods 
and give the main results . A pancake collapse similar to our 
runs without conduction has recently been computed by Shapiro, 
Struck-Marcell and Melott ( 1 983) . 
3 . 1 Initial Conditions and the Zeldovich Solution. 
We let s and x denote comoving Lagrangian and Eulerian 
spatial vari੪bles . - We ignore the effects of random velocity 
dispersions of the collisionless relics since these redshift away 
as the universe expands ,  and are small relative to the gravitation­
ally-induced velocities at the time of pancaking (Bond, Szalay 
and White 1 983) . For such cold initial conditions, the Zeldovich 
( 1 970) solution describes the deviations of the particle positions 
at time t from their initial values by 
x(s , t) = s 
- b (t) n (s) 
where b = ( 1 +z)-1 in the n=1 models we are most concerned with ; 
and n (s) = (kbc)-1 sin (ks) for a single plane wave of comoving 
wavenumber k and wavelength L = 2Tik-1 
A caustic forms when x=O, 
at b=bc · This formula is exact in the linear regime, and in 
one-dimension until caustic formation. 
It also describes the 
early nonlinear phases of 3-dimensional evolution rather well . 
The distribution of the principal eigenvalues, Ai, of the 
(anti-) strain tensor ( 3ni/3sj ) describes the 3-dimensional 
patterns which first appear in the nonlinear evolution of a 
density fluctuation spectrum with a damping cutoff . The over­
density is related to these eigenvalues by

(3) 
The principal axes , 1 , 2 , 3 ,  are always ordered so that /.1 Ѫ/.2Ѫ/.3 . 
Therefore, by definition, collapse is most rapid along the 1 -axis ; 
and caustics, where 6-+<x> , occur at /. 1-maxima . The surfaces of 
/..1-maxima are generally curved, with curvature at most of order 
the damping scale . Different surfaces intersect at points of 
degeneracy of the 1 and 2-axes , where "- 1="-2 · More extreme point­
like configurations form where all 3 axes are degenerate . These 
topological structures are catalogued by Arnold, Shandarin and 
Zeldovich ( 1 982) . 
In the neighbourhood of every /. 1 -maxima surface, 
the flows are essentially one-dimensional : we expect our 1 D  
simulations to describe the post-caustic evolution o f  these 
regions rather well. Directions 2 and 3 may continue undergoing 
transverse expansion which differs little from the Hubble expansion 
initially. However, within a few Hubble times of the collapse 
redshift, transverse flows toward the 1-2 degeneracy lines 
(strings) may become important . To model this in our 1 -D calcula­
tions , we utilize an anisotropic expansion factor, a2 (t) = 
a(t) ( 1 -b (t) /.2) ,  where "-2 is taken to be constant . 
This approx­
imation may be quite reasonable since BCSW demonstrate that the 
tidal force toward strings dominates the pressure gradients 
opposing such motion, so dark matter and shocked gas should flow 
toward the strings together, following the Zeldovich solution. 
3 . 2  Evolution Equations . 
Neutrinos are followed by direct N-body simulation of their 
equations of motion: dva2 /dt = -V¢ , where v=dx/dt is the comoving 
peculiar velocity. The gravitational field equations reduce -
for these nonrelativistic particles - to Poissons equation, 
except that the source is the overdensity relative to the back­
ground. This couples the N-body code to the gas dynamical code -
which utilizes Eulerian hydrodynamics in comoving space . We solve 
transport equations for the following quantities : ( 1 )  Baryon 
number . (2) Momentum - artificial viscosity is used to treat 
shocks . (3) Matter energy, including ionic and electronic contri­
butions . Artificial viscosity provides the shock heating . Energy 
losses arise from bremsstrahlung, Compton cooling, and He and H 
recombination cooling. Flux-limited conduction is included: 
transfer primarily occurs via electron-electron collis ions , 
although ion-ion collisions are also incorporated. (4) Ion energy . 
This transport equation includes ion-ion conduction, and a term 
describing the relaxation of the ionic temperature towards the 
electron temperature via ion-electron collisions . 
It is the ions 
which are shock-heated and the electrons which cool . The ion and 
electron temperatures can therefore differ - especially near the 
shock front . The equation of state is that of an ideal gas with 
ionization fraction determined by the balance of collisional 
ionization (eH+epe) with recombination (ep+Hy) . We do not 

DARK MATTER AND SHOCKED PANCAKES 
93 
explicitly calculate the He ionization fraction; it is , however, 
included in the cooling rate . 
Complications arise since the 
pancakes are generally optically thick in their central regions 
to Ly a and to radiation above the Ly edge . 
Still , lower energy 
radiation escapes , allowing continual rapid cooling . 
3 . 3  Pancake Timescales . 
Some of the timescales of relevance to the shock problem are 
plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 1 for a specific 
choice of the baryon density - which corresponds to an overdensity 
of 102 above that of the background gas .

The bremsstrahlung and He and H recombination cooling times 
scale with density as nB-1 , but for given nB are redshift­
independent . 
Compton cooling is nB-independent, but varies as 
( 1 +z)-4 • One does not have to go to very large redshift before 
Compton cooling completely overtakes bremsstrahlung . 
The 
conduction timescale across a region of size Lx of uniform density 
is also plotted; the scaling is 'rcond <u nB (Lx) 2 ( 1 +z) -2 • 
This 
illustrates that conduction is primarily important in the outer 
shocked regions . When the sound crossing time across Lx, 
Ts '" ( 1 +z)-1Lx, exceeds Tcond• we are in the flux-limited trans­
port regime. 
These cooling and conduction timescales are compared 
with the dynamic੓l tʆmescale for the collapsing baryon layer, or 
with (5H)-1 '" ( 1 +z) - 12- the latter choice is better . 
(See § 3 . 5) .

The major point of Fig . 
cooling is very rapid . 
3 . 4  Shock Evolution. 
J. R. BOND ET AL. 
is that once T falls below 1 00 eV, 
We began our calculations in the linear regime, 8<< 1 . The 
initial phase of the collapse just demonstrates the validity of 
the Zeldovich solution - even for the gas , which has a small 
pressure . However, near the redshift of caustic formation, zc -
the collapse redshift - the central density rises rapidly (Eq .3) , 
and the gas pressure builds up due to the adiabatic compression. 
The shock forms approximately at the point where the incoming ram 
pressure equals this gas pressure (Sunyaev and Zeldovich 1 972) , 
i . e .  near the sonic point . The collisionless relics begin to 
separate from the gas after this .  In Fig. 2, overdensities of 
baryons and neutrinos are given as a function of comoving position 
for a pancake of wavelength 25 Mpc which caustics at zc=S . The 
universe has Q=1 ,  QB=0 .091 and h=1 . The neutrinos form density 
spikes at the edges of the well known phase space spirals which 
appear in 1D simulations (See, e .g. Bond, Szalay and White 1 983) . 
The gas is confined by the ram pressure, much of it to a region 
smaller than 1 0  kpc . The spread in neutrinos is more than an 
order of magnitude greater at these times . 
The temperature profile evolution for the 25 Mpc pancake is 
shown in Fig . 3 .  Conduction clearly transports energy from the 
hot exterior inward, thereby flattening the temperature gradient . 
The profiles drop precipitously toward 1 eV and hydrogen re­
combination below T ƣ 1 00 eV. By z=4 .8 ,  ƣ9% of the gas has cooled 
below this temperature; by z=3, 1 1 % has cooled with conduction, 
14% without . 
It takes conduction time to operate . This is 
especially evident in Fig. 4: a 54 Mpc pancake begins with only 
ƣ4% of the gas cold ; an inward-eating conduction front breaks 
through the center by z=3 .8 ,  resulting in essentially a flat 
profile by z=3 . For small wavelength runs , the temperatures 
achieved are lower, conduction is relatively unimportant, and a 
large fraction of the gas cools . 
Transverse compression results in adiabatic heating of the 
outer regions, but very rapid cooling of the inner ones . The 
boundary between the two regimes occurs at a mass fraction q=0 . 1 5  
for our standard L=25 Mpc model, hence does not result in a 
significant increase in cooling fraction. 
3 . 5  Semi-analytic Shocks . 
The major feature of our numerical runs is that the pressure 
is constant behind the front, and is equal in magnitude to the 
ram pressure . 
The ram pressure can be determined from the 
Zeldovich solution exterior to the shocked region (Sunyaev and

For simplicity, we have not included conduction, which would turn 
Eq. (6) from an ·uDE into a PDE . Near as(q) = ( 1 +zs (q) ) -1 , when 
the shock is at gas fraction q, T ੕ Ts Cas/a)V, hence we term v 
the cooling power . The initial condition for Eq. (6) is Eq. (5) . 
For adiabatic cooling, only vs is non-zero ; using (4) , we have 
vs ƣ 8/5 for f੖1 .  Eq . (6) is easily numerically .integrated with 
all correction factors included. The agreement with our full 
numerical no-conduction runs is very good, as Fig. 3 demonstrates .

In Fig . 5 ,  we plot the fraction of gas which has cooled below 
1 00 eV by z=3 for zc=5 collapses, qc . Below 1 00 eV, cooling down 
to 1 eV occurs rapidly; 100 eV is also the virial temperature for

If we assume the density fluctuations are initially adiabatic, 
the nature of the dark matter determines how the large scale 
structure first arises . 
If cold relics dominate, the theory is a 
variant of the hierarchical clustering picture developed by White 
and Rees ( 1 978) for the isothermal picture with dark matter . 
Peebles ( 1984) and Priraack ( 1 984) discuss the many positive aspects 
of this picture in this volume . However, it is difficult to see 
how ( 1 )  superclusters and large voids arise, (2) Q can be one -
if indeed it is one. 
If warm relics dominate, cooling is no 
problem, but again (1 ) and (2) do not come naturally. Further, 
dwarf irregulars and ellipticals would have to arise via frag­
mentation in the warm scenario, and if Md is of cluster scale, so 
would all galaxies . 
In neutrino-dominated models, ( 1 )  and (2) could naturally 
follow. 
On the other hand, building a theory with ƣ90% of the 
gas too hot to immediately condense on galaxies could be a problem. 
The X-ray emitting gas in rich clusters cannot have a mass much 
larger than ƣ2 times that in the galaxies of the clusters (Ku et 
al . 1 982) . However, since rich clusters may arise at the points 
of 3-fold eigenvalue degeneracy, and their gas has T ƣ 7 keV,

which is significantly higher than that of pancake gas , we should 
not identify the two sorts of hot gas . 
Intergalactic gas with 
T > 1 0  eV and one-tenth the critical density cannot be ruled out 
(Sherman 1 982) . 
Indeed, it may be desirable to have most of the 
baryons unclustered on galactic scales, since there is apparently 
a gap between the baryon density required at the primordial nucleo­
synthesis epoch to generate consistent light element abundances 
(Gry 1 984 , Schramm 1984) and that inferred from luminous matter. 
Thus , the neutrino theory may well survive this cooling problem.

The pancake p icture with massive neutrinos has a nonl inear 
mass scale for dark matter different from that inferred from the 
galaxy autocorrelat ion funct ion . 
In the f irst part of this 
paper , we suggest ways in which the correlat ion function for 
mass dens ity may differ from that of ga laxies . 
In the second 
part , we predict the magni tude of the Zeldovich-Sunyaev effect 
arising from pancakes . 
Elect rons in the hot gas created by 
pancake shocks can upscatter photons in the microwave background 
radiat ion , caus ing spectral distortions . 
Angular differences in 
these di stort ions lead to temperature fluctuat ions which are on 
the edge of observabil ity , and can be used as a test of the 
pancake scenario ,

CORRELATION FUNCTION AND PANCAKES 
Recent ly , 3-dimens ional N-body simulat ions of galaxy 
clustering with ad iabatic initial condit ions were carried out 
by several groups (Clypin and Shandarin 1982 , Frenk et al . 1983 , 
Centrella and Melott 1983 ) , 
The fluctuat ion spect ra used had 
sharp cut o ffs at around 40 Mpc ,  as predicted by calculat ions 
of linear f luctuat ion growth in a neutrino-dominated universe 
(Bond and Szal ay 1981 , 1983; Peebles 1982) . 
The presence of 
voids and f ilament s ,  the percol at ion properties ( Shandarin 1983) 
and even the shape of the correlat ion funct ion found in these 
experiments agree with observat ions , 
The correlat ion funct ion , s (r) , i s  calculated from the 
distribut ion of the ideal ized , collisionless particles .

tho se scales for which the overdens ity is nonl inear , the

correlat ion funct ion is found to steepen and to be given by a 
single power l aw .  
This overcomes the Peebles ( 1 974) obj ect ion 
to the pancake model , namely that a power l aw on small scales 
is unlikely .  
Indeed , i n  these simulations , this property i s  
used t o  fix the present t ime a s  the moment a t  which the slope 
of s equals -1 . 8 .  
Even though the correct shape i s  obta ined , an additional 
problem arises with the overall amplitude of s .  
If nonl inearity 
is required on pancake scales , then it should be approximately 
equal to the nonlinear scale of galaxy clustering , as Fall 
( 1981 ) and Peebles (1980) emphasized for baryon-dominated 
universe s ;  Bond , Efstathiou and Silk ( 1980) and Peebles ( 1982 )  
pointed out that neutrino-dominated universes also have this 
problem . 
The simulat ions have made this argument prec ise and 
acute , as White et al . ( 1 984) extensively discuss in this 
volume . 
A simple al gorithm for ' mocking ' dissipat ion - by 
ident ifying part icles at the highest local densities with 
galaxies - makes this discrepancy even more pronounced. 
White 
et al . also find that nonl inearity is predicted to occur at low 
redshift , hence galaxies would form too late . 
These two diff iculties originate as a resul t o f  equat ing 
the galaxy-galaxy correlation function with the correlation 
function of the collis ionless part icles . 
Is this justified? 
In the adiabatic picture with a large damping cutoff , galaxies 
arise only after large structures have collapsed , shocked , 
and their cent ral regions have cooled to X10 4K ;  this cold gas 
then fragments into small clouds which give rise to galaxies as 
Bond et al . 
( 1 984) , hereafter BCSW, detail in this volume . 
The cooled fract io11 i s  a sensitive funct ion of mass scale and 
col lapse epoch , and can be anywhere in the range of 1-20% of 
the baryon mass for neutrino-dominated models . 
Most of the 
gas is far too hot to condense on galactic scales . 
Since the 
process of galaxy format ion is so sensitive to the deta ils 
of the gas dynamics , we can imagine a number of "ways in which 
the correlat ion funct ion of the dark matter may di ffer from 
that of galaxies . 
Exampl es are as follows : 
1 . 
E66 eet.6 06 Rehea;t/ng : 
Early pancakes form from low 
temperature (0. lK) gas ; they easily cool in their central 
regions , emitt ing radiat ion which will photoionize gas in 
regions which have not yet pancaked .  
Stars , quasars etc . 
which form after the first pancakes have collapsed will also 
cont ribute to this ionizing flux . 
I f  the se sources are maintained 
during subsequent pancake collapses , l ine cooling becomes 
ineffect ive ( Sunyaev , private communicat ion) , which lowers the 
cool ing rate . 
I f  no eool/ng occurs , cent ral regions are 
adiabat ically compressed as long as the gas pressure is less 
than the incoming ram pressure . 
The central density in a late

pancake could then be very much smaller than in a similar early 
pancake , so sool ing would 0ema,(,n inefifi ec.,t,i_ve, making galaxy 
formation unlikely . 
( If the gas :can be heated above 10 5K ,  
rapid cooling will def initely not occur; such temperatures are 
difficult to attain with typical photo-ioniz ing sources (but 
see point 5) . 
In some circumstances , the inhib it ion of line 
emission may be prove sufficient to avoid rapid cooling) .

(BCSW ,  Eq . 9) , and so will vary from pancake to pancake 
and even from place to place within one pancake . 
The one to 
one relat ion between dark matter and galaxies is therefore 
broken . 
Similarly , the dependence o f  qc on collapse redshift 
also modulates the galaxy formation rate . 
3 .  
Efifi ee.t6 o fi  Conduc.,t,i_on: 
Variat ions in the cooled fract ion 
are further amplified by thermal conduct ion ;  the cold layer can 
even be completely erased for very large pancake s (BCSW) , 
thereby prevent ing galaxy format ion in those regions . 
4 .  
S.tfw.c.:tu.Jt.e o fi  Tight Cl2teM : 
Many t ightly bound clumps 
resembling rich clusters appear in the s imulat ions , espec ially 
at intersect ions of pancakes .  
They arise from transverse flows 
in pancakes and f ilaments , and can be assoc iated with some of 
the catastrophes discussed by Arnold et al . ( 1982) . 
These 
catastrophes start as simple pancakes , with the more complicated 
topology arising l ater as different collis ionless streams 
interpenetrate .  
Shock formation in the simple pancakes will 
prevent the gas from forming the more complicated topology by 
screening the later flows , which accrete onto the already 
shocked region . 
Though galaxies are coll isionless , the dissi­
pat ion which has already occurred makes their streaming pattern 
different than that of the dark matter ; their catastrophes 
will also differ . 
This is in spi te of both components being 
sub j ect to transverse mot ion . 
Furthermore ,  the infall velocity 
for a spherically symmetric col lapse is considerably higher 
than for a flat system of the same mas s .  
This means that 
cooling will also be less effective in these regions than in 
pancakes .  
These two effect s can lead to a l esser concentrat ion 
of galaxies in t ight clusters than would be predicted from the 
dark matter distribut ion . 
5 .  
Explo1io3 : 
As discussed by Ostriker and Cowie ( 1981) , a 
chain react ion of explos ions can occur in the intergalact ic 
medilim. 
If such processes are initiated in pancakes , the 
shocks will not be spherically symmetric due to the inhomo­
geneity of the pancakes . 
They will proceed faster towards the 
density gradient . 
By itself , this will modify the relat ion 
between dark matter and galaxies . 
Any metal inj ection would

A. S. SZALAY ET AL. 
aid enormously in cool ing hot gas . 
On the other hand the kinetic 
energy from the explos ions provides another heat ing mechani sm 
for the IGM .  
For our purpo ses ,  it is more succes sful than 
heat ing by photo- ionizat ion , s ince the temperatures at tained 
can be far in excess of 10 5K ,  making cool ing difficult . 
In the current vers ion of the pancake pic ture , there are 
three different s ites for galaxy format ion ; pancakes ,  f ilaments 
and rich cluster s .  
Æhe contribut ion from each site t o  the 
number of galax ies and to their autocorrelat ion function is not 
well known . 
The relat ion of Ź for galaxies to Ź for dark matter

Radio experiment s of small beam size probe only small separations; 
they measure integral quantities along the line of sight . 
Typical experiment s involve either beam- switching through some

imaging of a given region . 

PANCAKES, HOT GAS AND MICROWAVE DISTORTIONS 
Pancakes are isobaric in their shocked regions , hence 
neTe 
Ę P is constant , so our l ine integral becomes a s imple 
sum over all pancakes along the l ine of sight :

Here Pn is the ram pressure of t h e  nth pancake given by BCSW , 
Equat ion ( 4 ) . 
The pancake s are generally t ilted to the l ine

xn/cos in · 
For face-on pancakes this is the width of the 
shocked region at the redshift of ob servat ion .

proves adequate for our purposes is

We est imate

Along the l ine o f  sight there will b e  many pancakes , and 
each will have a different collap se redshift , length scale ,

To calculate the contr ibution in detail 
requires the knowledge of the appropr iate probabil ity distri­
but ions . 
Lacking this , we use a s imple model to estimate the 
expected magnitude of the effect . 
We as sume all pancakes form 
at the same epoch , zp , with the same length , and are evenly 
spaced in comoving length along the l ine of sight .

PANCAKES, HOT GAS AND MICROWAVE DISTORTIONS 
Since pancakes form a cell-like structure in the universe , 
they are h ighly correlated at small separations . 
In this case 
c onside r  a 
' beam-switch ' d i fferential measurement .  
We can 
only get a cont ributi on from the pancake if it intersects 
with one beam , but not with the other . 
The only obv ious way 
to achi eve this is that we have e i ther a pancake edge-on , 
nearly tangential to the l ine o f  s ight , 
or we have a branching 
point of three pancake s .  
The total averaged contribut ion will 
be proport ional to d ( 8 , z ) /L ,  therefore on small angles we 
expect dT/T to be ris ing as 8 up to the l arge angle l imit . 
A review o f  the present observat ional situation was given 
by Part ridge ( 1981 ) , 
further references therein . 
The overall 
l imits on dT/T for scales from a few arc minutes to a few 
degrees are about 10- 4 • 
On the other hand as recent ly shown 
by Danese et al . 
( 1983) there i s  no hope of detect ing premeval 
f luctuat ions below the 10- 4 l evel due to the contribut ions 
f rom unresolved radio sources .  
However ,  by imaging technique s ,  
there i s  a nonvani shing chance , 
that one may see s ignal s at 3 o  
or h igher above the rms b ackground , with a rather sharp 
boundary :  a c lear s i gnature of a pancake . 
Even though our numbers are order o f  magnitude est imate s ,  
i t  i s  c lear 
that the dT/T coming from hot gas i s  very close to 
present upper l imi t s . With a more sophist icated treatment one 
can obtain strong l imits on the characteri stic scale and on 
the epoch of galaxy format ion in t he pancake pic ture . 
The 
inc lus ion of transverse contract i on l eading to f i l aments and 
c lusters wil l be important . 
The est imate s  presented here can 
already be used t o  rule out extremely large pancake s , which 
form at earl y epochs .

The standard hot model of the Universe predict a cosmic 
background radiation (CBR)

Small distorsions from an exact Planckian shape are indeed ex­
pected in order to account for the observed structure of the 
Universe. The detection of those small deviations from a black 
body spectrum and their features would then be highly informa­
tive on the growth and evolution of the primordial fluctuations 
responsible for the Universe populated by galaxies and clusters 
of galaxies .

vestigated since its discovery1 ) . The available observational

MEASUREMENTS OF THE CBR 
Measurements of the temperature of the CBR may be distin­
guished according to the techniques used in the observations 
and crudely divided into three groups: 
i) microwave observations in the Rayleigh-Jeans 
region of 
the spectrum; the instruments used are microwave radiome­
ters with low side lobes antennas Dicke-Switched superhe­
terodyne receivers ;  the measurements are usually carried 
out at high altitude sites in order to minimize atmosphe­
ric effects . 
ii) direct infrared observations at the peack and in the Wien 
part of the spectrum; the instruments used employ typical 
infrared 
technology 
with 
incoherent detectors ;  
in 
this 
frequency range atmospheric problems are so severe that 
observations are made possible only at balloon or rockets 
altitudes or with satellites. 
iii) Interstellar molecules ; 
direct ground based measurements 
of the CBR at the peak (millimeter and submillimeter wave­
lengths) are prohibited by the high atmospheric emissivi­
ty; indirect ground based observations are instead allowed 
by interstellar molecules

IS THE UNIVERSE MADE OF MASSIVE NEUTRINOS?

ABSTRACT The hypothesis that the mass density of the Universe is 
dominated by massive neutrinos leads to a relationship hetween 
the cosmological parameters n and H and the characteristic length 
scale of density fluctuations in the neutrino distribution at 
recombination. N-body simulations can he used to perform the 
mild nonlinear extrapolation required to compute a scale for the 
present neutrino distribution which can he compared directly with 
the clustering scale of galaxies. If nonlinear structures in the 
neutrino distribution formed significantly before the present 
day, the neutrino scale substantially exceeds that of the 
galaxies for any acceptable set of cosmological parameters. How­
ever, formation of structure before a redshift of 4 is required 
to account for high redshift quasars. The discrepancy is particu­
larly marked in open universes and is exacerbated when it is 
recognised that in the standard picture galaxies form only from 
high density material within pancakes . 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Reported measurements of a non-zero neutrino rest mass (1 ,2) 
a couple of years ago stimulated a revival of interest in the 
possibility that neutrinos are. the dominant component of the mass 
density of the present Universe. In addition to identifying the 
missing mass ,  this hypothesis can explain why constraints on the 
baryon density of the Universe based on analyses of cosmic 
nucleosynthesis disagree with dynamical estimates of the total 
density. It can also resolve the apparent conflict between 
observational limits on the small-scale anisotropy of the micro­
wave background and the "natural" assumption that inhomogeneities 
1 1 7

S. D. M. WHITE ET AL. 
in the early universe are predominantly in the most rapidly 
growing adiabatic mode (3) .  If the mass of the electron neutrino 
is really 
̣ 30 eV as suggested by some experiments ,  then in the 
standard Big Bang cosmology , neutrinos must provide a substantial 
fraction of the total cosmic density. 
A great virtue of the massive neutrino hypothesis is that in 
its application to cosmology it has only one uncertain parameter, 
the mass of the most massive stable neutrino. In conventional 
models this mass is directly related to observable cosmological 
parameters through the equation 
(1 ) 
where m3 0 is the neutrino mass in units of 30 eV, ކ is the 
density parameter, h is Hubble' s constant in units of 100 
km/s/Mpc, and e is the microwave background temperature in units 
of 2. 7 °K. Because neutrinos decouple from the rest of the 
universe at the relatively early epoch when kT 
̤ 2 MeV, the 
neutrino population can be treated as a noninteracting collision­
less but self-gravitating gas in calculations of the evolution 0f 
its density distribution on large scales. This situation is 
sufficiently simple that the evolution can be treated with a 
degree of rigour and confidence that is unusual in studies of 
this type. 
As a result certain predictions of the massive 
neutrino hypothesis are more easily falsifiable than is usual in 
theories for the formation of large scale structure. One firm 
prediction is that the phase-space density of neutrinos can no­
where exceed their phase-space density in the early universe; the 
latter quantity can be calculated directly with very few uncer­
tainties (4) .  This may exclude the identification of neutrinos 
with the missing mass which appears to be present in certain 
dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way (S , 6 , 7) . A second 
firm prediction is that free streaming of the neutrinos after 
they decouple but before they become non relativistic will wipe 
out all small scale fluctuations in their density distribution 
( 8 ) . 
Fourier components with wavelengths less than 
(2) 
are very strongly suppressed, the amplitude of waves of length A 
being reduced by an order of magnitude. Bond and Szalay (9) give 
a transfer function which can be used to calculate the power 
spectrum of density fluctuations present at recombination from 
any assumed fluctuation distribution at very early times .  The 
suppression of short wavelength perturbations means that non­
linear structure in a neutrino-dominated universe must form by 
some variant of Zeldovich' s pancake scheme in which coherent 
structures of supercluster size separate from the expansion and 
then fragment to form galaxies. 

IS THE UNIVERSE MADE OF MASSIVE NEUTRINOS? 
1 19 
In view of the large scales predicted by equations (1 ) and 
(2) an obvious question is whether the massive neutrino hypothe­
sis is consistent with the relatively small scale on which the 
observed galaxy distribution becomes nonlinear; this scale may be 
characterised by the distance, r0, at which its autocorrelation 
function is equal to unity. Recent work confirms that r0 = 5 h-1 
Mpc with relatively small uncertainties (10, 11) . By comparing 
the predictions of linear theory with observation, Peebles (12) 
concluded that it is very difficult to make the massive neutrino 
hypothesis consistent with observation. The main uncertainty in 
his conclusions stems from the assumptions he needed to estimate 
the epoch of galaxy formation and to take account of the non­
linear effects which are important on scales where the quantita­
tive properties of the galaxy distribution are well known. This 
uncertainty can be eliminated by simulating the nonlinear evolu­
tion of the neutrino distribution from the known linear initial 
conditions. On scales of a few Mpc the nonlinearity is quite 
mild and systematic effects resulting from the technical limita­
tions of N-body simulation methods can be kept at a relatively 
low level. 
Last year we carried out a series of simulations of the 
growth of structure in a universe where the density distribution 
at early times possessed a coherence length (13) . Identifying 
this length with the appropriate scale in a neutrino-dominated 
universe we were able to scale the nonlinear clustering in our 
Einstein-de Sitter models to fit observations of the galaxy 
distribution for values of h near 0. 8 .  Our elation at this 
success was tempered by a number of uncomfortable problems . 
Firstly the age of the universe implied by this scaling is only 
8 . 3  billion years and is uncomfortably short. 
Secondly we com­
pared the autocorrelation function of the particles in our models 
with that of galaxies rather than of neutrinos in the real TTni­
verse. In the pancake theory galaxies form only in the regions 
of space where the neutrinos are densest and their correlation 
length should therefore exceed that of the neutrinos (see below) . 
Finally we reproduced the galaxy autocorrelation function suc­
cessfully only during a brief period quite soon after nonlinear 
structures first collapsed. 
The observation of quasars at red­
shifts approaching 4 is inconsistent with the identification of 
this epoch with the present day. These difficulties are all 
related to the requirement that the model ratio of initial 
coherence length to final clustering scale should match the value 
inferred from the observed galaxy distribution and equations (1 ) 
and (2) .  In what follows we explore them further and find the 
discrepancies to be sufficiently large to cast considerable doubt 
on neutrino-dominated cosmologies of the kind extensively dis­
cussed in the recent literature.

2 SCALING N-BODY MODELS TO A NEUTRINO-DOMINATED UNIVERSE 
The N-body models discussed here and in our earlier paper 
(13) followed the evolution of the distribution of 1000 particles 
using a direct N-body integrator written by S .J. Aarseth. The 
particles were initially placed at those grid points of a cubic 
mesh which lay within a spherical boundary, and the whole system 
was given the uniform expansion required to make its total energy 
zero. We then perturbed the position and velocity of all the 
particles with a superposition of small amplitude waves of random 
direction and a restricted range of wavelengths. This procedure 
was designed to set up initial conditions corresponding to a 
specific spectrum of linear density fluctuations at early times . 
Subsequent evolution was followed explicitly by the code and 
results for any given initial spectrum were obtained by averaging 
simulations which started from different statistical realisations 
of it. Our early experiments used an initial power spectrum which 
was flat between upper and lower wavelength cutoffs. This is a 
poor representation of the actual power spectrum expected for a 
population of massive neutrinos and so there is some uncertainty 
in how the experiments should be scaled to represent a neutrino­
dominated universe. We adopted a scaling based on Peebles ' 
analysis of the density autocorrelation function at early times 
(12) . We have now performed experiments starting with fluctua­
tion spectra based on Bond and Szalay' s  (9 ) neutrino transfer 
function which confirm that this choice was appropriate. 
In order to compare the galaxy distribution with theoretical 
models it is desirable to choose a measure of clustering which is 
as insensitive as possible to the details of small scale cluster­
ing, and which can be determined accurately from galaxy surveys. 
Such a scale is the length, R, determined from the integral 
relation, 
1 ,  
( 3 )  
where ੑ(r) is the autocorrelation function of the galaxy distri­
bution. The integral on the left-hand side of this equation is 
closely related to the quantity J3 discussed by Peebles 
(12) . Recent observations give R = 5 ± 0. 7 h-1 Mpc (10) , where 
the uncertainty is based on comparison of results for different 
areas of the sky. In a neutrino-dominated universe the dimension­
less ratio of the present galaxy clustering scale to the present 
neutrino scale may thus be expressed in terms of purely cosmo­
logical parameters as 
R/A = 0.39 ± 0.06 Q h e-2

In our N-body simulations we know the value of A which is built 
into the initial conditions and we can calculate R, and thus R/A , 
for the particle distribution as a function of time . 
If we 
assume that the distribution of galaxies follows that of the 
neutrinos (see below) the model value of this ratio determines 
the value of hS-2 required for agreement with observation. This 
quantity must clearly lie within the observationally allowed 
range if the model is to be acceptable at the particular time 
considered. 
A further constraint arises because the models must be 
allowed to evolve long enough for galaxies to form and to age to 
their presently observed state. In a neutrino-dominated universe 
no galaxy-sized objects can form until the large-scale neutrino 
distribution has gone nonlinear. In our simulations we identify 
the onset of galaxy formation with the time at which 1% of the 
elements in our initial grid pattern have undergone collapse. 
LateƊ Ƌimes can then be identified by the expansion factor, 
1 + zGF • since the onset of galaxy formation. To be consistent 
with observations of galaxies at high redshift, zGF should exceed 
2 ,  and to be consistent with the existence of high redshift 
quasars it should exceed 4. This is an extremely conservative 
prescription because galaxy formation cannot occur simultaneously 
in all regions . 
In our simulations we find that by zGF = 2 only 
30% of the initial volume elements have undergone collapse. 
In Figure 1 we show the values of he-2 obtained by comparing 
R/A in N-body models of neutrino clustering with equations (4) .  
he-2 is shown as a function of ZGF for each ensemble of simula­
tions ; note that in any particular ensemble n is specified and 
cannot be adjusted. A f irst clear inference is that neutrino­
dominated universes with n significantly less than one can be 
definitely ruled out .  For example, with n = 0.2 and zGF = 2 . 5  a 
Hubble constant of about 400 km/s/Mpc is required for "agreement" 
with observation, showing a discrepancy of a factor of at least 4 
between the large coherence length of the initial conditions and 
the small observed clustering scale of galaxies (cf .  equation 4) . 
For n 
= 1 the situation is considerably better, but it is still 
difficult to obtain an acceptable model .  If the power spectrum of 
neutrino fluctuations in the early universe is taken to be of the 
"constant curvature" form, 
(5) 
where T(k) is the transfer function of Bond and Szalay (9 ) ,  then 
h 7 1 is required to match length scales if zGF = 2. 5 ;  this 
implies an age of less than 7 billion years for the Universe and 
so is in conflict with the ages of globular star clusters .

universe and observation is actually worse than appears from this 
comparison of galaxy clustering with the predictions of our 
simulations . In a neutrino-dominated universe galaxies are 
expected to form only in regions of high neutrino density where 
the baryonic material can shock , cool and fragment . As a result 
there should be no galaxies in low density regions which may , 
nevertheless, contain a significant fraction of the neutrinos . In

such a s ituation the correlation length, R, for the galaxies is 
expected to exceed the corresponding scale for the neutrinos . 
To 
i llustrate this using our models , we assumed that the only "vis­
ible" particles would be those in regions where the local density 
was at least twice the overall mean. On small scales this assump­
t ion increased the amplitude of the correlation function hy ahout 
the square of the factor by which the total particle number de­
creased. As a result the clustering length increased considerably 
and agreement with the observed scale required h > 1 . 6  in a flat 
universe with n = 1 .  Although this particular procedure is 
clearly quite arbitrary , it shows that a realistic treatment of 
galaxy formation is likely to worsen the scaling difficulties of 
neutrino-dominated universes . 
It seems that for any plausihle 
cosmological parameters the coherence length of a neutrino­
dominated universe is too large to be consistent with the rela­
t ively small scale '.'.>n which we see nonlinear structure in the 
present galaxy distribution. The discrepancies are large enough 
that the chances of f inding some means of salvaging the neutrino 
p icture look very poor. 
Finally we note that if there are m 
flavours of stable neutrino with nearly equal mass ,  the scaling 
constraints are essentially the same as in a universe with den­
s ity n/m which is dominated by a single neutrino species. 
Such 
multiple neutrino models are strongly ruled out by observation.

TBE PREGALACTIC UNIVERSE AND TBE FORMATION OF LARGE SCALE STRUC­
TURE 
Craig J. Hogan 
California Institute of Technology 
ABSTRACT: We summarize a number of reasons for believing that pregalac­
tic sources of energy, such as quasars or protogal.axies, may have 
significantly influenced the development of the large scale galaxy distribu­
tion. A brief review is presented of specific mechanisms by which this may 
have occurred and their observati.onal consequences. It is possible that the 
large scale structure may be primarily due to such activity, rather than the 
direct effects of primordial adiabatic or isothermal fluctuations. 
The astrophysical production of radiative or hydrodynamical free 
energy from nuclear burning or gravitational accretion leads to a wide 
variety of processes which significantly affect the motion and distribution of 
matter within galaxies. Such complicated nonlinear processes as shock 
waves, magnetic dynamos, jets, turbulent flows, galactic winds and foun­
tains, etc. are taken for granted on small scales Ź 1011 M0. Generally one 
does not ask what is the "fundamental reason" for this activity, or inquire 
about the details of the initial conditions. Instead, one tries Lo understand 
what the dominant process is in any given situation, in order to construct a 
realistic simple model of what is going on. Of course ,  some situations are so 
compl.icated that this effort fails, as in the problem of star formation. 
On the very largest scales, we have a qmte different situation. Here the 
universe is accurately described by a simple homogeneous and isotropic 
Friedmann model, and the only force involved is gravitation. 
These 
essential features of the very large scale structure of the universe depend 
cructally on "initial conditions" (or at least on events which occurred very 
early, before the net baryon charge was generated), and are quite 
unaffected by the complications on small scales.

But there is a particularly fascinating transition regime on scales 
... 1015-16 M0, the largest scales where nonlinear inhomogeneity appears in the 
clustering of galaxies. We do not know whether this structure is due pri­
marily to small perturbations in large scale cosmological initial conditions 
on these scales, or to astrophysical activity of the type which is observed on 
smaller scales ( 1). I will adopt the term "neogenic" to refer to the 
hypothesis that the large scale inhomogeneous structure in the galaxy dis­
tribution is primarily due to free energy released by comparatively recent 
events occurring at say- z Ÿ 105, and that it is not significantly affected in a 
direct way by fluctuations on the same scale originating at earlier times. In 
this view the direct effec ts of inhomogeneous structures originating in the 
earlier universe occurred on such a small scale that they have been erased 
by subsequent cosmological evolutionary proC.esses which can be under­
stood without reference to the cosmological initial conditions. The opposite 
hypothesis (and the most popular), which I will call "paleogenic," is that the 
galaxy distribution is due mainly to direct effects of primordial fluctuations 
on the same scale as the presently observed inhomogeneity, and that the 
action of quasars or similar neogenic energy sources may be safely 
neglected (at least in first approximation) in formulating a theory of large 
scale structure. 
Of course, there is room for middle ground between the two views, if it 
turns out that neither primordial fluctuations nor pregalactic evolutionary 
processes can be safely neglected on these scales. But it is simpler to talk 
about it as a simple dichotomy, and indeed it would seem to be a fortuitous 
coincidence if both effects, while having totally unrelated causes, should 
have comparable amplitude. In this paper I summarize some reasons for 
preferring a neogenic scenario, and describe some simple models of pre­
galactic activity which may be able to explain the present day large scale 
inhomogeneity. 
I also describe some observational strategies for choosing 
between the various models. In concentrating on the neogenic view I do not 
wish to imply that there are very conclusive reasons for preferring it; it is 
just that the paleogenic scenarios are amply reviewed in this volume and 
elsewhere. 
It is surprising that these issues in extragalactic astronomy are inti­
mately related to current research topics in high energy physics. If the 
paleogenic view is correct, then the structure must be caused by fluctua­
tions introduced into the metric at very early times indeed -- t Ÿ 10-35sec -­
during an early phase in the universe's history when observed scales could 
have been in causal contact. This is possible in principle (for example in 
"inflationary" universes) but only before the net baryon number was 
created, the reason being that the baryons introduce an absolute comoving 
scale and thereby lead to the classical particle horizons of Friedmann 
universes. (Baryon generation occurs at very high temperatures, which is 
why we require an early time). The dimensionless amplitude orp of the 
binding-energy fluctuations (which ultimately form the binding energy of 
galaxy clusters in paleogenic scenarios) can be calculated in inflationary 
universes from the fundamental Lagrangian adopted for matter (2,3,4). To 
lead to a reasonable paleogenic scenario the amplitude must lie in the range 
orp ̢ 10-6 to 10-5 (depending on the composition of the "missing mass".) The 
neogenic hypothesis asserts that the primordial orp ;;:; 10-a

implies that that some s eed structure which triggers all the astronomical 
activity must be generated in one of the more recent phase transitions , say 
at 
electroweak 
symmetry breaking 
( r,,,1 00 GeV, t ,,,10-9sec) 
or 
at 
quark 
confinement (Ã0.2 to 1 GeV, t ,,, 1 0-5sec). 
Several astronomical coincidences support the "naturalness" of the 
neogenic scenario. 
The first is well known: becaus e gravity is scale fre e, 
some nongravitational process must have s elected the present day non­
linear mass scale (defined as the total mass around a typical galaxy in 
excess of the mean) ,  M0 Ã 1 0150h-1M0. 
It is a suggestive coincidence that 
Mo approximg.tely c oincides with the mass of matter within a Hubble length 
at the epoch t0q when the matter and radiation densities are equal, the "radi­
ation pressure Jeans mass" M17 = 1016(0h2)-2M0. 
Indeed M17 is known to be 
the largest scale over which a nongravitational force (in this case radiation 
pressure) c an have affected the evolution of density perturbations (5), so it 
seems 
practically 
certain 
that 
this 
scale , 
which 
is 
imprinted 
at 
z ޅ z0q = 104·50h2, has something to do with the scale of galaxy clustering. 
In the paleogenic scenarios , M17 imprints a characteristic mass by passively 
modifying a preexisting spectrum of primordial fluctuations, through damp­
ing 
or some other scale dependent modification of the growth rate of 
fluctuations. In the neogenic scenarios, nongravitational forces play a more 
active role, and we would 
expect that the largest scale of inhomogeneity 
ought naturally to be the larg e st scale over which nongravitational forces 
can effectively transfer momentum in an expansion time ( and thereby alter 
the pure gravitational equations of motion) . 
In some neogenic scenarios 
(describe d below) this scale is still precisely the characteristic radiation 
Jeans scale MJ-y which appears in the paleogenic models. 
Another scale is also well known but J ess frequently commented upon: a 
characteristic binding energy (v I c )2,,,10-6 or velocity v ,,,3ookm/ sec also 
exists in the galaxy distribution (6) and must be imprinted nongravitation­
ally. It is this property of the clustering which naturally leads us to take the 
neogenic view. 
The characteristic velocities of g alaxies are about the same 
as velociti es within galaxies which we know are not of primordial origin, 
such as the motion of hot gas in the interstellar medium or in galactic winds 
(whose energy balance relies on heating by supernovae) ,  or matter in disks 
which must have undergone c onsiderable dissipati.on in a gaseous phase, and 
thus probably have a binding energy determined in some way by the cooling 
function of dilute g as. 
It is also suggestive that the crossing-times of stars 
in galaxies and galaxies in groups and clusters span a continuous range of 
order t ,,, 1 08-10y , c ommensurate with the evolutionary timescales of stars or 
efficient Eddington-limite d  sources of radiation ( e . g . ,  QSO's), and that the 
binding energy densities on e ach scale (v I c )2p 
are commensurate with 
each other and with the mean c osmological energy density of starlight . 
These order of magnitude c oincidence s  are fortuitous in the paleogenic 
scenarios (indeed, the most natural situation in a paleogenic model would be 
an obvious discontinuity in the various dynamic al quantities between sys­
tems of paleogenic origin and those of neogenic origin) , but they arise 
naturally if one assumes that astrophysical sources of energy are primarily 
responsible 
for 
the structure. 
From this point of view the 
paleogenic 

128 
C. J. HOGAN 
scenario therefore has what particle physicists like to call a "fine-tuning 
problem:" there is no particular reason why the amplitude of perturbations 
on the scale Mi-, should be just sufficient to collapse at an epoch comparable 
to a stellar evolution time. In the neogenic picture, the time at which this 
structure appears ought naturally to be commensurate with the evolution 
time of the energy sources. The paleogenic view is of course still quite plau­
sible; the fluctuations are specified by a single number, the dimensionless 
amplitude orp, and it could very well be that an amplitude of the correct 
magnitude appears in (say) a supersymmetric model of the new inflation 
(3, 1 0) ,  as the ratio of a fundamental mass to the Planck mass. But the 
preceding comments still cause us to worry about exactly how large a scale 
we have to go to before we can safely ignore evolutionary effects caused by 
the release of energy. 
Thus, although the very large scale uniformity of the universe must be a 
consequence of highly symmetric conditions at early times, there is no com­
pelling evidence that primordial fluctuations are of direct relevance to the 
observed galaxy clustering, since we know that matter on these scales must 
have been rearranged by nongravitational forces in any scenario, and that 
the energy to do this without paleogenic fluctuations is available without 
recourse to sources of free energy significantly different from those we 
observe. Proof of significant primordial fluctuations would require evidence 
of inhomogeneity on much larger scales than Mi'Y; such proof could in princi­
ple come from observation of the angular spectrum of microwave back­
ground anisotropy (7). The paleogenic model would predict that tempera­
ture fluctuations at large angular scale ·11 should have the characteristic 
amplitude of the scale-free initial perturbations, 6 TI T ,.,. orp, independent of 
19- (B); while the neogenic model would predict that the angular fluctuations, 
if they are observed at all, are produced by discrete sources of radiation 
and anisotropies at large 19- ought to hold to the characteristic behavior of 
two-dimensional white noise perturbations in brightness temperature, 
(oT I T) or 11-1 (9). At present no convincing evidence exists in either direc­
tion. 
We now turn to a brief discussion of the mechanisms which can produce 
large scale structure from pregalactic stellar energy. Even if the neogenic 
view is correct, there is still reason to hope that we may be able to develop a 
more convincing simple model than we have been able to do for star forma­
tion, because there are very few plausible mechanisms for moving matter 
around on scales as large as ,.,.1 015-16M0. Furthermore, the mechanisms are 
quite different in character and hence unlikely to be of comparable impor­
tance -- in other words, it is likely that the largest-scale inhomogeneity was 
generated by whatever single nongravitational force had the largest range, 
and is therefore likely to be described as a simple process. 
The first of these mechanisms to be considered utili.zed explosive 
energy from supermassive (,.,.1 Q5M0) stars ( 1 1). An explosiveenergy source 
has also recently been proposed with a more detailed treatment of gas 
dynamics and cooling (and without restrictive assumptions about the nature 
of the exploding 
object) by Ostriker and Cowie ( 1 2) 
and Ikeuchi 
( 13). 
Their basic idea is "explosive amplification"; an exploding galaxy or 

THE PREGALACTIC UNIVERSE AND LARGE SCALE STRUCTURE FORMATION 
129 
quasar can create a mass of bound material greater than its own mass. The 
kinetic energy of explosion is converted by shocks into heat; gradients in 
gas pressure lead to compression, cooling, and collapse of matter in a shell 
surrounding the original explosion. The characteristic scale of structure l 
created is determined by equating Hubble velocity lH with sound speed 
Vs '"'" (pl p)*-. To order of magnitude, the temperature required in the gas is 
equal to the virial temperature in the final bound systems; for present-day 
clustering 
with 
v   300-1000 km/ sec, 
this 
temperature 
is 
about 
(v I c )27nproton ""' 107-B K. This process is therefore restricted to occur at 
redshifts z Æ 7, because at higher redshift ionized gas can cool in less than 
an expansion time by Compton cooling on the microwave radiation, so that 
energy is radiated before it can be usefully converted into 
motion and the 
scale of collapsing shells is much less than vs/ H .  At redshifts z Æ 7, explo­
sive amplification proceeds until the medium is too hot to cool in a free-fall 
time. A sphere of hydrogen gas in the relevant density range in hydrostatic 
equilibrium with its own gravity can cool in a free-fall time if its mass is less 
than .._.1Q12M0 or its radius in less than '"'" 75kpc ( 14-18), and so one can 
argue that galaxies appear quite naturally in this picture. 
Promising as these models are, it is well to bear in mind several 
difficulties. It is not certain that shocks would remain coherent on a 
sufficiently large scale to explain the observed galaxy clustering structure. 
Also, massive, tightly bound systems such as the Coma cluster have a virial 
temperature so high (>108K) that the corresponding proto-cluster gas cloud 
could not have radiated its binding energy in a free-fall time; we would not 
expect to find such bound systems in the universe today, because they 
would have "bounced" rather than collapsed. F'inally, the objects which 
explode probably radiate about 1% of their rest mass as visible light (which 
is more than they release in the explosions). The fact that we do not see it 
means that there is a significant dust obscuration out to a redshift z ڪ 5, 
which degrades the optical light into what is now the submillimeter region. 
The energy density of this radiation is probably not much smaller than the 
microwave background, and we know that it must have been released inho­
mogeneously on a scale of order 5 h-1 Mpc, or about 3 arc minutes in angu­
lar size; thus it is somewhat surprising that submillimeter astronomers have 
not seen anisotropy of cosmological origin. With IRAS and other new far­
infrared technology, a systematic search for the radiation in different 
wavebands may be made. 
Carr and Rees (19) have discussed various other "neogenic" scenarios. 
One important point made by them is that it is relPctively easy to affect the 
efficiency of galaxy formation with a comparatively small amount of energy, 
because the temperature required to raise the Jeans mass to ... 1011 M0 in 
dilute gas at the mean cosmological density at recent epochs is in the UV 
range, ! 105K. Thus it may be possible to introduce apparent large scale 
structure in the galaxy distribution without having to move the correspond­
ing mass around, using only ""10 eV/gas atom instead of the '"'"l keV it would 
take to produce a genuine mass perturbation. If this type of effect has been 
important it might explain why virial estimates of the mean cosmological 
density consistently give 0 < 1 (see e.g. (6)), in spite of our prejudice that 0 
ought to be 1 ± g, based on fairly general cosmological fine-tuning argu­
ments applied to the initial conditions (20). 
If the galaxies have an 

130 
C. J. HOGAN 
unrepresentative autocorrelation function which is grealer than that of the 
background matter, it would help to explain their unexpectedly low veloci­
ties. 
If pregalactic energy sources formed quite early ( z ބ 100; t Ź 107y) , 
then another neogenic scenario is possible (5, 21), which is a straightforward 
generalization of conventional paleogenic "isothermal" fluctuations. One 
assumes that small protogalaxies or QSO's are created by some unspecified 
evolutionary processes on smaller scales, which we need not be concerned 
about. The model then aims to show that their radiation would generate 
fluctuations on large scales which later iead to galaxy clustering. Thus the 
hope is that the final step in the formation of structure can be described by 
such a simplified model without reference to what occurred earlier on 
smaller scales, which may well have involved a complicated system similar 
to the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. In the model, random fluctuations 
in luminosity per mass lead to perturbations in the radiation energy density; 
the resulting flux of radialion drags matter (in the form of interstellar pho­
toionized gas) along with it by Thomson drag; and this leads to density per­
turbations, up to masses of order Mil'· One attractive feature is that a pre­
cise linear calculation is possible, similar to those describing the evolution 
of perturbations in the pre-recombination big bang but with terms added to 
represent the sources of radiation. (The spectrum of the added radiation is 
not important because the dominant opacity is still Thomson scattering.) In 
this way one can determine exactly how much inhomogeneity must appear 
in the large scale radiation field to create a given matter density perturba­
tion on the observed scales, and fairly rigorous predictions can be made 
about lhe amplitude, angular spectrum and polarization of the resulting 
microwave background anisotropy, which are not sensitive to the various 
parameters of the model, such as the size of the protogalaxies or the energy 
density of radiation they release. We expecl the peak amplitude to be on an 
angular scale of about one or two degrees, and to be greater than about 
o T/ T ""  5xl0-5; and the polarization anisotropy on this scale is about 
lx 10-5. Al larger 19-, o TI T "" 19--1 , independent of the parameters. For­
tunately, this prediction seems well within the range of present or planned 
experiments to measure the anisotropy (22,23,24). Although the starting 
conditions of this model are rather unsatisfyingly complicated, it does pro­
vide a natural explanation of why galaxies, if they began to form early 
enough, should now be clustered on as large a scale as they are, and also 
accounls for the binding energy of clusters in a natural way.

The density fluctuations associated with the formation of 
large scale cosmic pancake-like and filamentary structures can 
be evaluated ( 1 ) using the Zeldovich approximation (2) for the 
evolution of non-linear inhomogeneities in the expanding universe . 
At the scale introduced by these non-linear density fluctuations 
due to pancakes , the standard scale-invariant (Ý r-Y) correla­
tion function Ѧ(r) is modified. The corresponding J3 integral 
d 
J3(d) = f r2 Ѧ(r) dr

The modification of the higher order moments (>2) of the

additional constraints on A and f .  It will be an important dis­

CLUSTERS OF GALAXIES AS INDICATORS OF GALAXY ORIGIN

In this paper I am discussing vaxious difficulties 
occuring while the clusters of galaxies axe invest­
igated. The special emphasis is put on the brightness 
profiles of galaxy clusters , ellipticities and position 
angles of clusters . The distribution of position angles 
of galaxies in the Local Supercluster is also discus­
sed .  
1 .  INTRODUCTION 
It is commonly acc epted that structures existing now 
in the Universe reflect the physical processes which 
have led to their formation. Theories of galaxy origin 
predict phenomena and relations among cluster paxa­
meters , which c an be tested , in principle ,  by observa­
tions . Therefore ,  the detailed studies of structures 
in the Universe performed even in one range of the 
electromagnetic spectrum ,  e . g. the optical one , could 
be useful in eliminating some theories . 
In this paper I would like to present some results 
connected with investigations of galaxy clusters , point­
ing out difficulties connected with their interpreta­
tion. On the other hand, an observer dealing with data 
and trying to interpret them, always meets with mix­
ture of effects ,  those survived from the very origin 
of structures and the others connected with evolution. 
moreover, the same phenomenon could be explained

theoretically either by origin processes or by evolu­
tion. 
2 .  SECONDARY :MAXIMUM IN THE BRIGHTNESS PROFILE 
This effect may be used aȊ a typical example of a phe­
nomenon having different theoretical explanations /for 
review see : Flin ( 1 982a) , Trevese and Vignato ( 1 982) / .  
Due t o  the fact that some authors are claiming that 
this phenomenon, when observed , is caused either by 
the departure from assumed spherical symetry of the 
cluster or by subclustering , I decided to check the 
correctness of these statements . Dressler sample (1 98ȋ 
of Abell clusters served as an observational basis . 
From total number of 55 clusters the subsample consist­
ing of 30 clusters was extracted. All the clusters , in 
which galaxies are extending over the distance 2 Mpc 
/assuming H0 
= 50 km I sec 
• Mpc belong to that sub­
sample/ 
For each cluster iterative proc edure was applied 
and cluster center was determined. The it erative pro­
cedure of finding the maximal proj ected density of ga­
laxies i s  the same , as described in the previous paper 
/Flin ( 1 982 b) / ,  but with modification /this modification 
changes some numerical values given in the previous pa­
per , but does not change the conclusion/ . The clust er 
center was fixed when : 
1 .  the number of galaxies is maximal in the innermost 
ring with radius 0 . 2 5  .Mpc , 
2 .  the procedure is numerically stable .  
Keeping the cluster c enter fixed, the covariance ellips e 
was fitted in classical manner /Trumpler and Weaver 
1 953/ .  Later on the counts of galaxi es in elliptical 
rings were made and brightness profiles were constructed 
/fig. 1 / , assuming equal weight to each galaxy. 
The distances of obs erved secondary maximum were 
compared with the distribution of galaxies in cluster. 
I distinguished two types of subgroups : 
1 .  laying in narrow position angle from the cluster 
c enter, and 
2 .  elongated subgroups forming ring-like structures .  
The results of these analyses show that taking into 
account the axial symetry instead of previously as­
sumed spherical symetry does not eliminate the oc­
curence of secondary maximum. Moreover, some of these 
observed secondary maxima are caused by "ring-like" 
structures .

In few c ases the existence of secondary maximum cannot 
be attribut ed to any evident subgroup. 
S0metimes ,  for 
weak phenomenon its appearance depends on the cluster 
c ent er coordinates . Deviations from the smooth dis­
tribution, regarded as secondary maxima a.re greater 
than thoæe d¥72to statistical fluctuations , when their 
measure is N 
• 
But two points ought to be stressed in connec tion 
with brightness profiles : firstly , in some clusters 
when secondary maximum is observed in optic al region, 
the brightness profiles observed in X-ray range are 
quit e  smooth /Jones ( 1 982 ) / ,
secondly, 
assumed axial 
symmetry sometimes c auses the exist enc e of "new" s e­
condary maximum , which is different from that observed 
when spheri c al  symetry of cluster is assumed . 
3 .  THE ELLIPTI CITIES AND POSITION ANGLES OF CLUSTERS 
In several papers 
Carter and Metcalfe (1 980 ) 
, Bing­
geli ( 1 982 ) 
, Burgett (1 982) ellipticities of galaxy 
clust ers were investigated. Further , 
the analysis of 
the distribution of ellipticities and /or the compa­
rison of cluster position angle with position angle 
of the bright est member 
galaxy was c arried out . 
The method of covarianc e ellipse with modification 
increasing the obt ained ellipticities was developed by 
Carter and Metcalfe 
( 1 980) , and was also us ed by Burgett 
( 1 982) . Binggeli 
(1 982) fitted the straight line by usi:ng 
the Qrtogonal least squares method and det ermined the 

140 
P. FLIN 
the sums of galaxy distances from two axes .  These me­
thods as well as the fit Gf classical covariance ellipse 
give different values of obtained ellipticities and po­
sition angles . Furthermore , while the same method is ap­
plied , the values of discussed parameters depend on 
taking into account unweighted coordinates of galaxies 
/equal weight to each galaxy/ or luminosity weighted 
coordinates I Burgett ( 1 982 ) / .  This discrepancy is not 
important when a sample of clusters is investigated 
for statistical analysis of cluster properties . The ob­
tained values of clusters ellipticities are important 
while compared with theoretical predictions . E. g .  Bin­
ney and Silk ( 1 979 ) proposed a model giving numerical 
values of structure ellipticities in different moments . 
Therefore , I think, that the principal difficulty oc­
curing here is as follows :which values of ellipticities 
ought to be compared with the model? Moreover, the change 
of ellipticities with radial distance from the cluster 
c enter was notic ed for several clusters /Peach ( 1 982) , 
Burgett (1 982 ) / .  
As an example ,  I am presenting three such rela­
tions from my studies . In fig. 2 ,  e - denotes ellipti­
city of cluster ,  r - radial distance from the cluster 
c enter in :Mpc . Analyzing the change of ellipticities 
the problem of errors becomes very important . Carter 
and Metcalfe ( 1 980) and also Binggeli ( 1 982) applied 
Monte Carlo runs . Presently numerical simulations are 
performed with more realistic assumption than cluster 
spherical symmetry and King distribution of galaxies 
within cluster. Burgett ( 1 982) compared obtained el­
lipticities at different , but close each other distan­
ces from the cluster c enter. In my study obtained error 
ll e ރ 0 . 05 is the mean of differences of elliptici ties 
counted at the same distances from cluster c enters de­
termined as the mean arithmetic of member galaxy coor­
dinates /first step of iteration/ and the adopted c en­
ter with maximal proj ected density. The differenc e of 
obtained ellipticities at the same radial distanc es 
r 
from the cluster c enter depends also on the distanc e  
r ,  
which is quite understandable .  The number of galaxies 
is increasing with increasing 
r ,  so ÷e 
are dimishing. 
Differences of ellipticities counted for consecutive 
steps of iteration are much smaller than the quoted 
above value Ae . The change of ellipticity with radial 
distanc e  is observed for different clust er centers du­
ring iteration. Taking into account these mentioned 
above evidences it ought to be acc epted that this effect 
is statistically significant . Also , from the quoted 
by Burgett {1 982 ) values and their errors the same con-

clusion can be drawn out . Therefore , the observed ef­
fect of the change of clust er elliptieities with radial 
distanc e  from the c enters should be regarded as real . 
The influence of subclustering can be observed mainly 
as the instantaneous change of counted ellipticities . 
The further complication during cluster investiga­
tion , besides the problems of cluster c enter det ermi­
nation , is oc curing ; cluster position angle i s  also 
changing with radial distanc e from the c enter , as can 
be seen in figure 3 .  In connection with this effect 
the analysis of errors is even more complicat ed than 
in the case of ellipticity -
radial distanc e relation. 
Monte Carlo runs were appli ed by Binggeli ( 1 982 ) 
, Bur­
gett obtained fl PA in the same manner as 
A e .  I obtained 
A PA in the way previously described for ڮ e  determina-
tion. The same effect ,  that is the dependanc e of ll PA 
on 
r ,  which has the same explanation as relation òe 
versus 
r ó  is appearing. In both relations the values 
ڭ e and II. PA are reversely proportional to cluster el­
lipticity 
e .  The change of position angles s e ems to 
be also the real phenomenon. The effect of subclustering 
is manifesting itself through abrupt change of positi on 
angle ,  much stronger than the change of cluster ellipti­
ci ties . 
In testing different theories of galaxy origin 
the important question arises : at which distance from 
the cluster c ent er the clust er posi tion angle ought to 
be taken , in order to compare it with position angl e  of 
the bright est member galaxy , or with pos ition angle of 
neighbouring cluster . Binggeli ( 1 982 ) 
chose 2 Mpc , which 
s e ems reasonable from observational point of view . The 
cluster ellipticities ceunted at this distanc e are , in 
general , insensitive to the cluster c ent er c oordinat e s . 
:&'Dom the theoretical point of view one c an expect that 
at this radial distance the density is much smaller 
than in the clust er core , and evolutionary effec t s  are 
also small er . 
4 .  ALI GNMENT OF GALAXIES 
4 . 1 . Abell clust ers 
In some clus t ers , mainly L-type clusters the position 
angl es of maj or axes of member galaxies are not dis­
tributed randomly /for review s e e  Flin l 1 982a,) (1 983 ) I. 
I t  means that angular momenta of galaxie s  are correlat ed .

 galaxy evolution. There are not 
c@mmon agÒeements abeut the significancy of evolutionary 
proc esses which could change the angular momenta of ga­
laxies belonging to clusters . I believe that enviromen­
tal influenc e to galaxi es i s  not enough effective for 
changing position angles Qf many galaxies in clusters . 
If so , galaxy position angles are not changed from the 
very origin. The discussion of enviromental influenc e 
t o  galaxi es is recently reviewed by White ( 1 982) and 
the problems of gravitational interaction of galaxies 
are discussed by Farouki and Shapiro l1 981 ) 
• 
The pre­
cize discussion of different effect causing the observed 
alignment based on numeric al simulation is performed by 
MacGillivray et al . (1 982a} and MacGillivray and D<l>dd 
{1 982a, b J. 
4 . 2 .  The Local Supercluster 
Rec ent investigation of the distribution of elliptici­
ties and po sition angles of spiral and irregular gal­
axies performed by Mac Gillivray at al .  { 1 982b ) permit 
them to find "marginally significant tendency for gal­
axies to b e  aligned along t o  plane of Local Superclus­
t er " . This result was obtained using Hawley and Peebles 
method ( 1 975) 
• 
Als o  earlier investigations show rather 
similar results .  The only contradictory result was ob­
t ained by Jaaniste and Saar { 1 977) 
• MacGillivray at al . 
(1 982b) suggest ed an error in Jaaniste and S aar spheric al 
trygonometry . 
However the situation is much more c omplicated 
Flin and GodÓowski ( 1 983 ) 
• 
Jaaniste and Saar paper is 
internally inconsist ent . The description of the basic 
figure is different than the figure itself. Moreover , 
derived and applied formulae do not correspond to the 
manner of versors defining . Because their method is very 
int eresting and l ooks very promising we decided to re­
analyze i t . FrÔm detailed analysis of their paper it is 
clear that from possible solutions they selected only 
one . As a result of such approach the c elestial position 
of galaxy has a very strong influence to the results . 
Due to mentioned previously choice of the solution, an­
gular momenta of galaxi es more parallel to the superga­
l actic plane are selected on the northern hemisphere , 
more perpendicul ar -
on the S$Uthern hemisphere .  
Thes e  
a priori expected effects 
also depend on 
the line-of- sight galaxy inclination. The preliminary 
result of our analysis is showing that more galaxies a.re 
laying on the s outhern hemisphere , but they are close to 
the supergal actic plane . It cannot be excluded that this 
is c ausing the result obt ained by Jaaniste and Saar . 

144 
P. FLIN 
On the other hand there is a suspicion that the 
Hawley and Peebles method is prefering such result , as 
obtained by MacGillivray at al .  ( 1 982b) 
• If this sus­
picion will materialize , we shall consider MacGillivray 
et al . result as random diatribution of position angles . 
There is a paper in preparation, in which the same sample 
of galaxies /gal axies taken from UGC and ESO I Uppsala 
Survey I is analyzed using both methods , which ought to 
give consistent result . 
Mac Gilli vray at al. 
( 1 982b 1 concluded , that their 
result is supporting the scenario , in which subunits 
are formed after the protocluster. This point of view 
seems to be confirmed by Binggeli { 1 982) and not con­
firmed by Helou and Sal.peter ( 1 982 ) . The former author 
investigated the distribution of position angles of neigh­
bouring clusters , the latter authors studied 40 galaxies 
in the Virgo cluster, where for each galaxy the direction 
of angular momentum was determined. The sample of 306 
galaxies in the Local Supercluster was analyzed by Yama­
gata et al .  ( 1 981 ) .  For these galaxies the distinction 
of "S " and 
"Z " spiral a.rm was made. They concluded, that 
their result is consistent either with perpendicular 
model or with random distribution. 
5 .  CONCLUSION 
The aim of this paper was to show what optical studies 
of galaxy clusters could tell us about the origin of 
the structures in the Universe .  It is clear that such 
investigations permit us rather to eliminate ,  than to 
support some models of cluster /galaxy/ origin. 
The attention ought to be paid to the fact , whether 
the observed relations among cluster parameters exactly 
follow those predicted by the particular theory of gal­
axy origin. In the case of alignment of galaxies in 
clusters such careful discussion is pres ented by Helou 
and Sal.peter ( 1 982) . Moreover , different possible spu­
rious effect must be taken into account , when from the 
analysis of two-dimensional data someone would like to 
draw out conclusion concerning three dimensional struc­
tures . The above mentioned paȉers presenting the results 
of MacGillivray et al. ( 1 982a ) and MacGillivray and Dodd 
studies ( 1 982a,b) ought to be regarded as excellent dis­
cussion of these problems . 
I believe that contradiction 
among different investigations is rather due to the scar­
city of observational data and difficulties with their 
interpretations , and therefore cannot be regarded as

principal impossibility of the usage of clusters as 
indicators of galaxy origin. The detailed studies of 
clusters which are now in progress permit us to elimi­
nate some theories , or rather els e  classes of theories , 
of galaxy origin. Therefore , I think that the present 
status in this sub j ect is difficult , but not h0peless •

The probl ems wi th mass i ve hal os bei ng composed of baryon i c  
matter are di scussed . 
Speci fi cal l y ,  a hal o composed o f  ei ther 
gas , snowbal l s ,  ʃust and rock s ,  l ow mass stars , Jupi ter s ,  dead 
stars or neutron. stars is shown to be unl i kely .  
Hal os coul d be 
composed of bl ack hol es l ess than 100 M0 i f  they , unl i ke the 
stars in thi s  mass range , are extremely effi ci ently accreti n g  or 
pri mordi al . 
At present, however , parti cl es from supersymmetri c  
theor i es appear to offer the most interesti ng poss i b i l i ties as 
the constituents of hal os .

INTRODUCTION 
Spi ral gal axi es are surrounded by hal os , l arge amounts of 
sub-l uminous or non -l umi nous matter . 
These hal os are 
approximately spheri cal in shape and may extend out to 
di stances as far as ten times the opti cal radi us of a spi ral 
gal axy .  
The supporti ng evi dence for hal os i s  qui te compel l i n g .  
U s i n g  dynami cal arguments based on the rotati on curves o f  spi ral 
gal axi es , it is possi bl e  to accurately determi ne the hal o mass as 
a functi on of gal actic radi us. 
Al so , a number of independent 
arguments requi re that hal os be approxi mately spheri cal . 
Based 
on the informati on avai l abl e about hal os , it is not di ffi cul t to 
show that hal os contain about 10-100 times the mass in the di sks 
of spi ral gal axi es , and consequentl y ,  contain a s i gn i fi cant 
fracti on of the cosmol ogi cal mass density .

In contrast to the defi n i te statements that can be made 
regarding the exi stence of hal os , very l i ttl e can be sai d  about 
the exact nature of the hal o mass .  
At presen t ,  it appears that 
the most di rect way to determine the compositi on of the hal o mass 
is to show what hal os cannot contai n .  
In the present investi gati on we argue that hal os are not 
composed of baryon s .  
Our approach wi l l  be to show the probl ems 
associ ated wi th the fol l owi ng types of baryon i c  matter : 
gas , 
snowbal l s ,  dust and rocks ,  Jupiter-l ike objects , l ow mass stars , 
dead stars and neutron stars. 
I t  appears very di ffi cul t to avoi d 
the probl ems that we shal l present i f  hal os are baryoni c .  
We 
shal l di scuss a model in whi ch it i s  cl aimed, a primordi al hal o 
composed of gas can be converted into Jupi ters , and show that it 
i s  not sel f-consi stent. 
Though not baryoni c ,  bl ack hol es are a possi bl e  consti tuent 
of hal os . 
If hal os are composed of bl ack hol es they must be 
extremely effi ciently accreti ng or primordi al . 
Asi de from the 
possi bi l i ty of effi ci ently accreti ng bl ack hol es , we expect the 
cosmol ogi cal baryoni c  abundance to be l ow at the time of 
nucl eosynthesi s .  
We shal l bri efly di scuss the current si tuati on 
regardi ng the observed nucl ear abundances in terms of 
cosmol ogi cal producti on in a l ow baryon density uni verse . 
One of the earl i est di scussions of massi ve hal os surroundi ng 
spi ral gal axi es was gi ven by Hohl ( 1 ,2 ) . 
He found his model s of 
spi ral di sks to be unstabl e wi th respect to the growth of l ong 
wavel ength modes , and as a resul t, the di sks tended to devel op 
into bar-shaped structures wi thin about two revol uti on s .  
Hohl 
was abl e to stabi l i ze hi s model s by addi ng a fi xed central force 
whi ch he i denti fied wi th a hal o popul ati on of stars and the 
central core of the gal axy. 
Kal naj s ( 3 ) , con s i deri n g  only exact 
sol uti ons for infi n i tely thi n  spi ral di sks ,  expl ored ways of 
stabi l i zing the initial ly cool rotati onal state . 
Perhaps hi s 
most interesting resul t was that by embeddi ng the spi ral di sk in 
a uni form density hal o ,  stabi l i ty coul d be obtained . 
The possi bi l i ty that spi ral gal axi es mi ght be surrounded by 
massive hal os was emphasi zed by Ostri ker and Peebl es ( 4 ) . 
Using 
a 300-star gal acti c model they studi ed the instabi l i ty of spi ral 
structure to the devel opment of bar-l i ke modes . 
The onset of 
instabi l i ty was reached when t, the rati o of the ki neti c energy 
of rotation to the total gravi tati onal energy , increased to a 
val ue Č0 . 1 4 .  
From a l i terature survey , the authors concl uded 
that for systems ranging from fl uid Maclaurin spheroi ds to fl at 
gal actic systems wi th 105 stars , the cri tical val ue for the onset 
of instabi l i ty appears to be t 

 0 . 14 .  
Two di fferent ways were 
suggested to stabi l i ze the spi ral structure , a hot di sk 
popul ati on wi th radi al orbits and a hot spheri cal hal o .  
From a 

ARE MASSIVE HALOS BARYONIC? 
vari ety of arguments , it i s  now known that the hal o mass 
di stri buti on is spheri cal . 
151 
The strongest observati onal evi dence supporti ng the 
exi stence of mas s i ve hal os i s  dynami cal . 
The rotati on curve of a 
gal axy must sati sfy the cri teri on that in equ i l i br i um the 
i nwardly di rected gravi tational force must bal ance the outwardly 
di rected centri fugal force . 
Rotati on curves of gal axi es have 
been obtai ned by both opti cal and radi'o techni ques ( 5-1 1 ) . 
Data 
obtai ned on more than 50 spi ral gal axies reveal symmetric 
rotati on curves whi ch support the equi l i br i um condition 
( 1 )  
where Mr i s  the mass wi thi n  radi us r ,  K i s  a constant rangi ng 
from 2/n for a thi n  di sk to uni ty for a spheri cal ly symmetri c  
mass di stri buti on , G i s  the gravi tati onal constant, and v i s  the 
c i rcul ar rotati onal vel oci ty at gal actic radi us r .  
The 
observati on s show that v i s  a constant independent of r, and ,  as 
may be seen from eq . ( 1 ) ,  Mr 
̠ r .  
Beyond about 50 Kpc i t  i s  di ffi cul t ,  typical ly ,  to observe 
rotati on curves , and bi nary gal axi es ( 12 , 1 3 )  have been used to 
sampl e the hal o mass di stri buti on at l arge radi i .  
Unfortunately 
there are a var i ety of sel ecti on effects whi ch binary gal axi es 
are subj ect to and it has not yet been possibl e to untangl e these 
effects suffi ci ently to unambi guously interpret the resul ts 
( 14 ) . 
As al ready menti oned , several arguments have been used to 
show that the mass di stri buti on of hal os i s  spheri cal ly 
symmetri c .  
The pers i stence of warps in spi ral di sks ( 15 , 16 ) , 
star counts ( 17 ) , and the scal e hei ght of stars perpendi cul ar to

EV IDENCE AGAINST NONBARYONIC HALOS 
Much of the di scussion about nonbaryon i c  hal os has been 
presented el sewhere by Hegyi and Ol i ve ( 20 ) . 
Here we shal l 
summari ze parts of that di scussion and ampl i fy other parts . 
Before starti n g ,  however , we defi ne a "standard hal o" whi ch we 
shal l need to eval uate
1ʂ vari ety of properti es of baryon i c  hal os . 
For thi s  hal o ,  Mr 

 10 
M0 i n  a radi us of 100 kpc . 
Fi rst we cons i der a hal o made of gas . 
In a col d gaseous 
hal o ,  parti cl es moving on radi al orbits woul d qui ckly col l i de 
wi th other gas parti cl es and col l apse on a gravi tational

= ( 3n /32Gp ) l/2 

 5x108 yrs . 
Si nce hal os must 
persi st for 1010 years , they must be in hydrostati c equi l i br i um 
and they must be hot . 
Our standard hal o ,  i f  it wgre gaseous ,  
requi res an equil i bri um temperature of TEQ 

 2 x10 ° K  which i s  
suffi ciently hot to viol ate the upper l imi ts on the X-ray 
background by a factor of 20 . 
The X-ray emi ssivity i s  sen s i ti ve 
to nHal o • the fracti on of the criti cal dens i ty contai ned i n  hal o .  
We use nHal o > 0 .05 ( 21 ) .  
A hal o of snowbal l s  wi l l  not be stabl e on a cosmol ogi cal 
timescal e .  
Snowbal l s ,  consi sti ng primarily of hydrogen , are 
di sti ngui shabl e from Jupi ters because they are bound 
el ectrostati cal ly. 
It turns out that the bindi ng energy of a 
hydrogen mol ecul e to sol i d  hydrogen i s  suffici ently smal l so that 
it easily escapes , even when the temperature of the snowbal l i s  
at 3° K ,  the temperature of the present cosmi c background 
radi ati on . 
In fact , hal os must have formed when the temperature 
of the cosmic background radi ati on was over 7°K ;  
si nce hal os are 
composed of non-interacti ng parti cl es and cannot evol ve to hi gher 
dens i ties , they must have formed when the den s i ty of the un i verse 
had a den sity about equal to the present density of hal os . 
The argument against a hal o of snowbal l s  requi res two steps .  
Based on l aboratory measurements on sol i d  hydrogen , its vapor 
pressure at 3°K has been found to be about 9xlo-12 mm ( 22 ) . 
Thi s 
i s  hi gh enough so that it is possibl e to show that there i s  no 
equi l i br i um between the sol i d  and gaseous phase of hydrogen . 
The 
second part of the di scussion invol ves the rate at whi ch 
mol ecul es evaporate to reach equi l i br i um. 
The time for 
evaporati on (23) of a H2 mol ecul e (mol ecul es rather than atomic 
hydrogen , wi l l  l eave the snowbal l preferenti al ly because thei r 
binding energy i s  lower ) i s  
t 
̟ [ v  e-b/kT]-1 
ev 
o 
• 
( 2 )  
The evaporati on time i s  the inverse of the product of two terms : 
a Bol tzmann factor whi ch i s  the probabil i ty of a system attai n i n g  
the escape energy , and an attempt frequency , the number o f  times 
per second that the system stri kes the barri er .  
The reader i s  
referred to ( 20 )  for more detai l s . 
Here we report that at 3°K ,  
the evaporation time per mol ecul e i s  l ess than 10-8 seconds . 
Next we con si der a hal o composed of dust and rock s ,  i . e .  
metal s .  
A hal o made of metal s woul d contain a factor of about 50 
times the mass of the di sk of a spi ral gal axy . 
The factor of 50 
ari ses as the rati o of nHa1 0/noi sk ͼ .05/ . 001 
> 50 . 
The probl em 
i s  that i f  even a very smal l fraction of the hal o mass mi xed 
wi th the di sk it woul d l ead to a l arge metal abundance in the 
di sk . 
Si nce the hal o i s  bel i eved to have formed before the gi sk 
and si nce there are di sk stars wi th metal abundances Z 
̞ 10-
, 

ARE MASSIVE HALOS BARYONIC? 
thi s  impl i es that l es s  than about one part in 5xlo6 of the hal o 
mi xed wi th the di sk gas . 
It i s  di ffi cul t to bel i eve that the 
hal o coul d be composed of metal s wi thout contaminati ng the di sk 
at such a l ow l evel . 
153 
The next poss i bi l i ty that we cons i der i s  a hal o composed of 
l ow mass stars or Jupi ters ( 24 ) , that i s ,  obj ects which are 
gravi tati onal ly bound wi th m č 0.08 M0 whi ch do not have high 
enough central temperatures to support nucl ear burn i n g .  
By 
mak i n g  observati ons of the surface bri ghtness of the hal o ,  it i s  
pos s i bl e  to set l imi ts on the mass in l ow mass stars . 
If a 
connecti on can be establ i shed between the nucl ear burn ing stars 
( M  > 0 . 8M0 ) and the Jupi ters , then by establ i shing con strai nts on 
the l umi nous porti on of the i n i ti al mass functi on , con strai nts 
are simul taneously set on the non -nucl ear burning porti on of the 
i n i ti al mass functi on . 
To connect the l uminous and non-l umi nous parts to the hal o 
i n i t . al mass functi on , a si ngl e power l aw rel ati on has been 
assumed . 
The justi fi cati on for thi s  assumpti on i s  that the 
physics whi ch affects the l ower mass l imi t for nucl ear burn i n g  i s  
independent of the physics whi ch govern s gravi tati onal col l apse 
and it woul d be a cons i derabl e coi nci dence i f  these two mass 
scal es coi ncided. 
Nucl ear burn ing depends on the fine structure 
con stant, a, and the strength and range of strong interacti ons 
whi l e  the physics of gravi tati onal col l apse depends on 
a and the 
gravi tati onal constant, G .  
Since the assumpti on that the hal o 
i n i ti al mass functi on i s  a si ngl e power l aw i s  the strongest 
assumpti on in thi s  manuscr i pt, we shal l return to thi s  subject to 
present other supporti ng evi dence and di scuss the substanti al 
probl ems that must be overcome to seri ously consi der a radi cal ly 
di fferent i n i ti al mas s  functi on , namely a hal o of Jupiters wi th 
negl i gi bl e  mass in nucl ear burn i n g  stars . 
As we shal l show , the mass-to-l i ght rati o ,  M/L ,  of a hal o i s  
a function of the sl ope of the initi al mass functi on , x ,  and the 
l owest mass condensati on whi ch forms gravitati onal l y ,  ffimi n • al so 
known as the Jeans mass .  
The initial mass functi on i s  defi ned

where <l>m i s  the number of stars per uni t  mass per uni t  vol ume of

The quanti ty ,  
LG, i s  the l i ght due to gi ants . 
Si nce observati onal con strai nts 
are avai l abl e in the I and K Johnson spectral bands for the hal o 
of the edge-on spi ral gal axy NGC 4565 we shal l eval uate PL i n  
these bands . 
The data of Gunn and Tinsl ey ( 26 )  in the range 
0 . 08 M0 to 0.8 M0 have been fi t wi th the power l aw i n  eq . ( 6a ) . 
For the l uminosity in the I ban d ,  Lm 1 ,  c = 1 . 49xlo-3 and D =

where mass i s  expressed i n  sol ar uni ts and i n  each spectral band, 
the l umi nosity equal s uni ty for a zero magn i tude star . 
To express the contri buti on of gi ants to the surface 
bri ghtness we have used the method descri bed in Ti nsl ey ( 27 ) . 
Si nce Ti nsl ey di scussed a metal abundance Z = .01 , we corrected 
the Ti nsl ey model s using the cal cul ati ons of Swei gart and Gross 
( 28) . 
Fitting the l ater cal cul ati ons ( for m =  .7 M0 , Y = .30) 
for the change i n  mai n  sequence l i fetime as a functi on of Z, the 
correcti on to the l i fetime was found to be 
oc exp[28 . 6Z -

that i s ,  increasing Z increased mai n  sequence l i fetimes . 
Al so , 
i t  may be seen that thi s  factor i s  equal to uni ty for Z = 0 .01 . 
For these cal cul ati ons we have used Z = 10-5 , a val ue appropri ate 
to hal o stars. 
Li fetimes for smal l er metal abundances are not 
changed appreciabl y .

To cal cul ate M/L for the hal o of NGC 4565 , we shal l use 
M/L 
= Pm/PL 
= om/ol , where om and ol are the projected mass and 
l umi nosi ty den s i ty .  
I t  i s  necessary to eval uate the projected 
hal o mass den s i ty in terms of the 21 cm rotati onal vel oci ty

observed out to 11 . 6  ށ , Rmax 
= 81 Kpc . 
Using eq . ( 8) and eq . ( 7 ) , 
i t  may be seen that M/L for the hal o i s  only a functi on of x and

We now turn to the observati onal data on the surface

Data taken wi th the annul ar 
scanni ng photometer ( 30 )  i n  the Kron I band has been di scussed by 
Hegyi ( 31 ) , see Fi gure 1 .  
That data has been transformed to the

A l east squares fi t 
to that data using the functi onal form ol

performed . 
( Thi s functi onal f£rm assumes that Rmax i s  l arge

ARE MASSIVE HALOS BARYONIC? 
157 
There are some observati ons whi ch have a bearing on our 
assumpti on of whether the initi al mass functi on i s  a si ngl e power 
l aw bel ow the nucl ear burn i ng cutoff . 
Probst and O ' Connel l ( 4 1 )  
argue that the initi al mass functi on in the sol ar nei ghborhood 
does not even ri se as steeply as a singl e power l aw for stel l ar 
masses l ess than 0 . 1  M0 • 
Instead the sl ope turns over , meani n g  
that there i s  l i ttl e mass contai ned in stars wi th m < 0 . 1  M0 • 
Since these resul ts are based on stars wi th sol ar metal 
abundance , the concl usions are strengthened for stars whi ch have 
l ower metal abun dances and whi ch cannot cool as effecti vel y .  
Though we have argued that it seems reasonabl e to use a 
power l aw for the sl ope of the i n i ti al mass near 0 . 08 M0 and that 
any possibl e  gravi tati onal condensati on of smal l er mass woul d 
adhere to the same power l aw, l et us now con si der the possi bi l i ty 
that only Jupi ters formed . 
As a prototypi cal model , we shal l

Rees . 
In that model , a Jean ' s  mass at recombi nati on , 10 -10

cool s and forms a very thi n  di sk of thi ckness equal to the Jean s

Subsequently the di sk fragments contri buti ng 108-109 Jupi ters to 
the formation of a hal o of Jupiters . 
There appear to be two l arge-scal e instabi l i ti es whi ch the 
di sk must avoi d i f  Jupi ters are to form : 
the tendency of the 
di sk to form a bar , and the in stabi l i ty of a cool di sk to form

Though bl ack hol es do not have a wel l defi ned baryon number , 
we shal l bri efly consi der them because i f  hal os are not baryoni c ,  
they are evi dently ei ther composed of bl ack hol es or some weakly 
or very weakly interacti n g  parti cl es ( see revi ew by Joel Primack

It appears unl i kely that many bl ack hol es in the mass range 
1-50 Me formed in the hal o .  
Stars in thi s  mass range eject a

Bl ack hol es which are more massive 
than 100 Me appear to be excl uded by new observati ons ( 45 ) , 
though they need to be confi rmed . 
Thus , hal os coul d be composed 
of bl ack hol es in the mass range Ÿ50-100 Me ( 46 )  or they coul d be

Arguing by el imi nati ng spec i fi c  baryon i c  forms of matter i s  
not the most persuasi ve way to argue that hal os are not baryoni c ,

WHAT IS THE DARK MATTER? 
IMPLICATIONS FOR GALAXY FORMATION AND PARTICLE PHYSICS

ABSTRACT We discuss three arguments that the dark matter which dom­
inates the present universe is not baryonic - based on excluding 
specific baryonic models, deuterium abundance, and the absence of 
small-angle fluctuations in the microwave background radiation. 
If the dark matter consists of elementary particles, it may be 
classified as hot (free streaming erases all but supercluster­
scale fluctuations) ,  warm (free streaming erases fluctuations 
smaller than galaxies) , or cold (free streaming is unimportant) . 
We consider scenarios for galaxy formation in all three cases. We 
discuss several potential problems with the hot (neutrino) case: 
making galaxies early enough, with enough baryons, and without too 
much increase in Mtot/Mium from galaxy to rich cluster scales. 
The reported existence of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with relatively 
heavy halos is a serious problem for both hot and warm scenarios .  
Zeldovich (n = 1) adiabatic initial fluctuations in cold dark matter 
(axions, or a heavy stable "ino") appear to be lead to observed 
sizes and other properties of galaxies , and may also yield large 
scale structure such as voids and filaments . 
I .  INTRODUCTION 
There is abundant observational evidence that dark matter (DM) 
is responsible for most of the mass in the universe (1) . Dark 
matter is detected through its gravitational attraction in the 
massive extended halos of disk galaxies and in groups and clusters 
of galaxies of all sizes. 
It is appropriate to call this matter 
"dark" because it is detected in no other way; it is not observed 
to emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength. 
Matter observed in these latter ways we will call "luminous" .  Here

we consider the nature of the dark matter. 
II. THE DM IS PROBABLY NOT BARYONIC 
There are three arguments that the DM is not "baryonic" ,  that 
is, that it is not made of protons , neutrons, and electrons as all 
ordinary matter is . As Richard Feynman has said in other contexts , 
one argument would suffice if it were convincing . All three argu­
ments have loopholes. The arguments that DM # baryons are as 
follows : 
A. 
Excluding Baryonic Models (2) 
The dark matter in galaxy halos cannot be ੗ (it would have 
to be hot to be pressure supported, and would radiate) ; nor frozen 
hydrogen "snowballs" (they would sublimate) ; nor dust grains (their 
"metals", elements of atomic number 2:3, would have prevented for­
mation of the observed low-metallicity Population II stars) ; nor 
"jupiters" (how to make so many hydrogen balls too small to initi­
ate nuclear burning without making a few large enough to do so?) ; 
nor collapsed stars (where is the matter they must have ejected 
in collapsing?) .  
The weakest argument is probably that which attempts to 
exclude "jupiters" : arguments of the form "how could it be that 
way?" are rarely entirely convincing. 
B. Deuterium Abundance (3) 
In the early universe, almost all the neutrons which "freeze 
out" are synthesized into 4He. The fraction remaining in D and 
3He is a rapidly decreasing function of n ,  the ratio of baryon to 
photon number densities. The presently observed D abundance (com­
pared, by number, to H) is (1 - 4) x lo-5 • Since D is readily con­
sumed but not produced in stars, 10-5 is also a lower limit on 
the primordial D abundance. This, in turn, implies an ѥ limit 
n ހ lo-9 , or 
(1) 
where ǽb is the ratio of the present average baryon density Pb to 
the critical density 
(2) 
H0 is the Hubble parameter (the subscript o denotes the present 
epoch) , and observationally h = H0 (100 kms-1Mpc-1 )-1 lies in the 
range ѧ ;::; h ,s; l .  The total cosmological density ǽ = PtotlPc is very

difficult to determine observationally, but it appears to lie in 
the range 0.1 ,:: S1 :; 2. Cosmological models in which the universe 
passes through an early de Sitter "inflationary" stage, predict S1 
very close to unity. 
In a baryon dominated universe (S1 "' S1b) ,  the deuterium bound, 
Eq. (1) , is consistent only with the lower limit on S1, and then 
only for the Hubble parameter at its lower limit. An Einstein­
de Sitter or inflationary (S1 = 1) or closed (S1 > 1) universe cannot 
be baryonic. 
C. Galaxy Formation 
In the standard cosmological model, which we will adopt , large 
scale structure forms when perturbations o = op IP grow to o ;;: 1, 
after which they cease to expand with the Hubble flow. Let us 
further assume that perturbations in matter and radiation density 
are correlated (these are called adiabatic perturbations, since 
the entropy per baryon is constant ; these are the sort of pertur­
bations predicted in grand unified models) .  Then photon diffusion 
("Silk damping") erases perturbations of baryonic mass smaller 
than (4)

Thus galaxies (Mb :; 10 l l- l  Z M9 ) can form only 
collapse of larger-scale perturbations (5) . 
matter dominated universe grow linearly with 
(3) 
after the "pancake" 
Perturbations o in a 
the scale factor 
(4) 
where z = (;\.0 - ;\) /;\ is the redshift and T is the radiation tempera­
ture. 
In a baryonic universe, o grows only between the epoch of 
hydrogen recombination, zr "' 1300, and z "'  S1-1 • 
It follows that at 
recombination oT/T .. op/3p ݿ 3 x lo-3 for M ;;:  Msilk• which corresponds 
to flue tuations on observable angular scales 8 > 4 '  today. 
Such 
temperature fluctuations are an order of magnitude larger than 
present observational upper limits (6) . 
The main loophole in this argument is the assumption of adia­
batic perturbations. 
It is true that the orthogonal mode, pertur­
bations in baryonic density which are uncorrelated with radiation 
(called isothermal perturbations) , do not arise naturally in cur­
rently fashionable particle physics theories where baryon number 
is generated in the decay of massive grand unified theory (GUT) 
bosons , since in such theories n = nb/ny is determined by the under­
lying particle physics and should not vary from point to point in 
space. But galaxies originating as isothermal perturbations do 
avoid both Silk damping and contradiction with present oT/T limits .  

166 
J. R. PRIMACK AND G. R. BLUMENTHAL 
A second loophole is the possibility that matter was reionized 
at some z ' •  by hypothetical very earlv uv sources .  Then the fluctu­
tions in oT/T at recombination associګted with baryonic proto­
pancakes could be washed out by rescattering, 
Despite the loopholes in each argument, we find the three 
arguments together to be rather persuasive, even if not entirely 
compelling, If it is indeed true that the bulk of the mass in the 
universe is not baryonic, that is yet another blow to anthropocen­
tricity: not only is man not the center of the universe physically 
(Copernicus) or biologically (Darwin) , we and all that we see are 
not even made of the predominant variety of matter in the universe! 
III. THREE TYPES OF DM PARTICLES : HOT, WARM & COLD 
If the dark matter is not baryonic, what is it? We wil l  con­
sider here the physical and astrophysical implications of three 
classes of elementary particle DM candidates, which we will call 
hot, warm, and cold, 
(We are grateful to Dick Bond for proposing 
this apt terminology . )  
Hot DM refers to particles, such a s  neutrinos ,  which were 
still in thermal equilibrium after the most recent phase transition 
in the hot early universe, the QCD deconfinement transition, which 
presumably took place at TqcD - 102 MeV . 
Hot DM particles have a 
cosmological number density roughly comparable to that of the 
microwave background photons , which implies an upper bound to their 
mass of a few tens of eV, As we shall discuss shortly, free 
streaming destroys any perturbations smaller than supercluster 
size, -101 5 M6 • 
Warm DM particles interact much more weakly than neutrinos .  
They decouple (i.e. , their mean free path first exceeds the hori­
zon size) at T > TqcD, and consequently their number density is 
roughly an order of magnitude lower, and their mass an order of 
magnitude higher, than hot DM particles. Perturbations as small 
as large galaxy halos, -1012 M6, could then survive free streaming. 
It was initially suggested that, in theories of local supersymmetry 
broken at -106 GeV, gravitinos could be DM of the warm variety (7) . 
Other candidates are also possible, as we will discuss .  
Cold DH consists of particles for which free streaming is of 
no cosmological importance, Two different sorts have been pro­
posed, a cold Bose condensate such as axions, and heavy remnants 
of annihilation or decay such as heavy stable neutrinos , As we 
will see, a universe dominated by cold DM looks remarkably like 
the one astronomers actually observe, 
It is of course also possible that the dark matter is NOTA -

none of the above! A perennial candidate, primordial black holes, 
is becoming increasingly implausible (8-10) . Another possibility 
which, for simplicity, we will not discuss, is that the dark matter 
is a mixture, for example "j upiters" in galaxy halos plus neutrinos 
on large scales (3) . 
IV. GALAXY FORMATION WITH HOT DM 
The standard hot DM candidate is massive neutrinos (3-5) , al­
though other, more exotic, theoretical possibilities have been 
suggested, such as a "majoron" of nonzero mass which is lighter 
than the lightest neutrino species , and into which all neutrinos 
decay (11) . For definiteness, we will discuss neutrinos . 
A. Mass Constraints 
Left-handed neutrinos of mass ੘l MeV will remain iਖ਼ thermal 
equilibrium until the temperature drops to Tvd• at whicµ point 
their mean free path first exceeds the horizon size and they es­
sentially cease interacting thereafter, except gravitationally (12) . 
Their mean free path is, in natural units (h = c = 1) , {'v - [ ovnਗ਼±] -l 
- [ (Gਜ਼k T2) (T3 )J -1 , and the hprizon size is A.h - (Gp) -Ѩ - MpJl, T- , 
where the Planck mass Mpt = G-Ѩ = l . 22 x l01 9 GeV = 2.18 x l0-5 g. Thus

Tvd 
- t1pJI, Gwk - 1 MeV. 
(5) 
After T drops below l MeV , e+e- annihilation ceases to be balanced 
by pair creation, and the entropy of the e+e- pairs heats the 
photons. Above l MeV , the number density nvi of each left-handed 
neutrino species (counting both vi and vi) is equal to that of 
the photons , ny, times the factor 3/4 from Fermi vs. Bose statis­
tics ; but e+e- annihilation increases the photon number density 
relative to that of the neutrinos by a factor of 11/4.1 Thus

where the sum runs over all neutrino species with mvi :; 1 MeV. 2 
Observational data imply that Qh2 is less than unity (3) . Thus 
if one species of neutrino is substantially more massive than 
the others and dominates the cosmological mass density, as for 
definiteness we wil l  assume for the rest of this section, then a 
reasonable estimate for its mass is mv - 30 eV. 
At present there is apparently no reliable experimental evi­
dence for nonzero neutrino mass .  Although one group reported (15) 
that 14 eV < rove < 40 eV from tritium S end point data, according to 
Boehm (16) their data are consistent with mv = 0 with the resolu­
tion corrections pointed out by Simpson. Thੜ so far unsuccessful 
attempts to detect neutrino oscillations also give only upper limits 
on neutrino masses times mixing parameters (16) . 
B. Free Streaming 
The most salient feature of hot DM is the erasure of small 
fluctuations by free streaming. It is easy to see that the mini­
mum mass of a surviving fluctuation is of order M੝i/mਫ਼ (17 , 4) . 
Let us suppose that some process in the very early universe -
for example, thermal fluctuations subsequently vastly inflated, 
in the inflationary scenario (18) - gave rise to adiabatic f luc­
tuations on all scales. Neutrinos of nonzero mass mv stream 
relativistically from decoupling until the temperature drops to 
mv, during which time they will traverse a distance dv = ;\h (T = mv) 
- Mp,\', m੟2 • 
In order to survive this free streaming, a neutrino 
fluctuation must be larger in linear dimension than dv• 
Corres­
pondingly, the minimum mass in neutrinos of a surviving fluctuation 
is MJ v - d੠mv nv (T = mv) - d੡m੢- Mpi3 rnv-2 • By analogy with Jeans ' 
calculation of the minimum mass of an ordinary fluid perturbation 
for which gravity can overcome pressure, this is referred to as 
the (free-streaming) Jeans mass .  A more careful calculation (4 , 19) 
gives

(10) 
which is the mass scale of superclusters . Objects of this size 
are the first to form in a v-dominated universe, and smaller scale 
structures such as galaxies can form only after the initial col­
lapse of supercluster-size fluctuations .

C .  Growth of Fluctuations 
The absence of small angle oT/T fluctuations is compatible 
with this picture. When a fluctuation of total mass -101 5 M9 
enters the horizon at z - 104 , the density contrast of the radia­
tion plus baryons ORB ceases growing and instead starts oscillating 
as an acoustic wave, while that of the neutrinos ov continues to 
grow linearly with the scale factor q, = (1 + z)-1 • 
Thus by recom­
bination, at zr '" 1300, ORB/ Ov < 10-1 , with possible additional 
suppression of ORB by Silk damping (depending on the parameters 
in Eq. (3) ) .  This picture, as well as the warm and cold DM schemes , 
predicts smal l  angle fluctuations in the microwave background radi­
ation just slightly below current observational upper limits (6) . 
In numerical simulations of dissipationless gravitational 
clustering starting with a fluctuation spectrum appropriately 
peaked at A ڪ  dv , the regions of high density form a network of 
filaments ,  with the highest densities occurring at the inter­
sections and with voids in between (5,20-22) . The similarity of 
these features to those seen in observations (23 , 24) is certainly 
evidence in favor of this model. 
D. Potential Problems with v DM 
A number of potential problems with the neutrino dominated 
universe have emerged in recent studies, however. 
(1) From studies 
both of nonlinear (22) clustering ( A :; 10 Mpc) and of streaming 
velocities (25) in the linear regime (A ; 10 Mpc) , it follows that 
supercluster collapse must have occurred recently: 
Zsc ݾ 0, 5 is in­
dicated (25) , and in any-case Zsc < 2 (22) . But then, if QSOs are 
associated with galaxies , their abundance at z > 2 is inconsistent 
with the "top-down" neutrino dominated scheme in which superclusters 
form first : 
zsc > Zgalaxies . 
(2) Numerical simulations of the non­
linear "pancake" collapse taking into account dissipation of the 
baryonic matter show that at least 85% of the baryons are so heated 
by the associated shock that they remain ionized and unable to con­
dense, attract neutrino halos, and eventually form galaxies (25a) . 
(3) The neutrino picture predicts (26) that there should be a factor 
of -5 increase in Mtot /Ml um between large galaxies (Mtot - 1012 M9) 
and large clusters (Mtot ;:; 1014 M9) ,  since the larger clusters , with 
their higher escape velocities , are able to trap a considerably 
larger fraction of the neutrinos. Although there is indeed evi­
dence for a trend of increasing MtotfL with Mtot (1, 27) , when one 
takes into account the large amount of x-ray emitting gas in rich 
clusters (28) one finds comparable Mtot/Mluf!) .. 14 for galaxies with 
large halos and for rich clusters (29, 30) . ੒Mlum here includes mat­
ter luminous in x-ray as well as optical wavelengths , in contrast to 
luminosity L that includes only the latter,) (4) Both theoretical 
arguments (3l) and data on Draco (32 ,33) imply that dark matter dom­
inates the gravitational potential of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The 

170 
J. R. PRIMACK AND G. R. BLUMENTHAL 
phase-space constraint (34) then sets a lower limit (33) mv > 500 eV, 
which is completely incompatible with the cosmological constraint 
Eq. (8) . 
(Note that for neutrinos as the DM in spiral galaxies, 
the phase space constraint implies mv > 30 eV. )  
These problems, while serious , may not be fatal for the 
hypothesis that neutrinos are the dark matter. 
It is possible 
that galaxy density does not closely correlate with the density of 
dark matter, for example because the first generation of luminous 
objects heats nearby matter, thereby increasing the baryon Jeans 
mass and suppressing galaxy formation. This could complicate the 
comparison of nonlinear simulations (22) with the data. Also, if 
dark matter halos of large clusters are much larger in extent than 
those of individual galaxies and small groups , then virial esti­
mates would underestimate Mtot on large scales and the data could 
be consistent with MtotfM1um increasing with M1um• But it is hard 
to avoid the constraint on Zsc from streaming velocities in the 
linear regime (25) except by assuming that the local group velocity 
is abnormally low. And the only explanation for the high Mtot/L 
of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in a neutrino-dominated universe is 
the rather ad hoc assumption that the dark matter in such objects 
is baryons rather than neutrinos .  Of course, the evidence for 
massive halos around dwarf spheroidals is not yet solid. 
V. GALAXY FORMATION WITH WARM DM 
Suppose the dark matter consists of an elementary particle 
species X that interacts much more weakly than neutrinos , The 
Xs decouple thermally at a temperature Txd >> Tvd and their number 
density is not thereafter increased by particle annihilation at 
temperatures below Txd• With the standard assumption of conserva­
tion of entropy per comoving volume, the X number density today 
nʀ and mass mx can be calculated in terms of the effective number 
of helicity states of interacting bosons (B) and fermions (F) , 
g =  gB + (7/8)gF, evaluated at Txd (35) . These are plotted in Fig. 1, 
assuming the "standard model" of particle physics. The simplest 
grand unified theories predict g(T) ,. 100 for T between 102 GeV and 
TGuT - l014 GeV, with possibly a factor of two increase in g begin­
ning near 102 GeV due to N = 1 supersymmetry partner particles. 
Then for Txd in the enormous range from -1 GeV to -TGUT• nɿ- 5gxcm-3 
and correspondingly mx "' 2S]h2 g}{1 keV (36) , where gX is the number 
of X helicity states. Such "warm" DM particles of mass mx - 1 keV 
will cluster on a scale -Mii m}C2 - 1012 M@ , the scale of large 
galaxies such as our own (7,37 ,38) . 
What might be the identity of the warm DM particles X? It 
was initially (7) suggested that they might be the ±ŷ helicity 
states of the gravitino G, the spin 3/2 supersymmetric partner of 
the graviton G. The gravitino mass is related to the scale of 

IMPLICATIONS FOR GALAXY FORMATION AND PARTICLE PHYSICS 
171 
supersymmetry breaking by me; = (4n/3)ѧmsusy2 m:pl, so me; - 1 keV cor­
responds to msUSY - 106GeV. This now appears to be phenomen­
ologically dubious, and supersymmetry models with mSUSY - 101 1  GeV 
and me; - :!;02 GeV are currently popular (39) . In such models , the 
photino y, the spin ŷ supersymmetric partner of the photon, is 
probably the lightest R-odd particle, and hence stable. But in 
supersymmetric GUT models my - 10 m੉, and there is a phenomenolog­
ical lower bound on the mass of tlie gluino mg > 2 GeV (40) . The 
requirement that the photinos almost all annihilate, so that they 
do not contribute too much mass density, implies that m:y ;: 2 GeV 
(14 ,41) , and they become a candidate for cold rather than warm 
dark matter. 
A hypothetical right-handed neutr੊no vR could be the warm 
DM particle (42) , since if right-handed' weak interactions exist 
they must be much weaker than the ordinary left-handed weak inter­
actions, so TvRd >> Tvd as required. 
But particle physics provides 
no good reason why any vR should be light. 
Thus there is at present no obvious warm DM candidate ele­
mentary particle, in contrast to the hot and cold DM cases . But 
our ignorance about the physics above the ordinary weak interaction 
scale hardly allows us to preclude the existence of very weakly 
interacting light particles , so we will consider the warm DM case, 
mindful of Hamlet' s  prophetic admonition 
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, 
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. 
A. Fluctuation Spectrum 
The spectrum of fluctuations ov at late times in the hot DM 
model is controlled mainly by free streaming; ov (M) is peaked 
at -M3 v •  Eq. (10) , for any reasonable primordial fluctuation 
spectrfrm. This is not the case for warm or cold DM. 
The primordial fluctuation spectrum can be characterized by 
the magnitude of fluctuations as they just enter the horizon. 
It 
is expected that no mass scale is singled out , so the spectrum is 
just a power law

Furthermore, to avoid too much power on large or small mass scales 
requires a •  0 (43) , and to form galaxies and large scale structure 
by the present epoch without violating the upper limits on both 
small (6) and large (44) scale (quadrupole) angular variations in 
the microwave background radiation requires K - 10-4 •  Eq . (11) 

172 
J. R. PRTh1ACK AND G. R. BLUMENTHAL 
corresponds to J ok j 2 o: kn with n = 6a + l . The case a = O  (n = l) is 
commonly referred to as the Zeldovich spectrum. 
Inflationary models predict adiabatic fluctuations with the 
Zeldovich spectrum (18) . In the simplest models K is several orders 
of magnitude too large, but it is hoped that this will be remedied 
in more realistic - possible supersymmetric - models (45) . 
The important difference between the fluctuation spectra oDM 
at late times in the hot and warm DM cases is that oDM warm has 
power over an increased range of masses, roughly from' 1011 to 
101 5 M0 • As for the hot case, the lower limit , Mx < Mp£3 mX_2 , arises 
from the damping of smaller-scale fluctuations by free streaming, 
In the hot case, the DM particles become nonrelativistic at es­
sentially the same time as they become gravitationally dominant, 
because their number density is nearly the same as that of the 
photons. But in the warm case, the X particles become nonrela­
tivistic and thus essentially stop free streaming at T - mx, well 
before they begin to dominate gravitationally at Teq 
= 6S1h2 eV . 
The subscript "eq" refers to the epoch when the energy density of 
massless particles equals that of massive ones :

We assume here that there are nv species of very light or massless 
neutrinos , and y =: pɾ/pɽ = (7/8) (4/11) 4/3 nv (= 0.681 for nv = 3) ,  
8 = T0/2. 7K, and cr is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant . During the 
interval between T - mx and T - Teq, growth of oDM is inhibited by 
the "stagspansion113 phenomenon (also known as the Meszaros (46) 
effect) , which we will discuss in detail in the section on cold 
DM. Thus the spectrum oDM is relatively flat between Mx and 
M eq 
(13) 
Fluctuations with masses larger than Meq enter the horizon 
at z < Zeq• and thereafter oDM grows linearly with a =  (1 + z)-l 
until nonlinear gravitational effects become important when oDM - 1. 
Since for a= 0 all fluctuations enter the horizon with the same 
magnitude, and those with larger M enter the horizon later in the 
matter-dominated era and subsequently have less time to grow, the 
fluctuation spectrum falls with M for M > Meq : 
oDM o: M-2/3 . For a

This is true for hot ,  warm, or cold DM. 
In each case, after re­
combination at zr "' 1300 the baryons "fall in" to the dominating 
DM fluctuations on all scales larger than the baryon Jeans mass, 
and by z :: 100, ob :: oDM (47) . 
In the simplest approximation, neglecting all growth during

• ੤l"here neff = n - 4 ;  i.e. , 
the spectrum is flattened by a factor of M&3 compared to the 
primordial spectrum. The small amount of growth that does occur 
during the "stagspansion" era s lightly increases the fluctuation 
strength on smaller mass scales : neff = n - 3. Detailed calcula­
tions of these spectra are now available (19 ,37) . 
B. Which Formed First ,  Galaxies or Superclusters? 
For a '  0 ,  ox (M) has a fairly broad peak at M - Mx • 
Conse­
quently, objects of this mass - galaxies and small groups - are 
the first to form, and larger-scale structures - clusters and 
superclusters - form later as ox (M) grows toward unity on suc­
cessively larger mass scales. For a particular primordial spectral 
index a, one can follow Pebbles (48, 49) and use the fact that the 
galaxy autocovariance function E, (R) :: 1 for R = 5h-1 , together with 
the (uncertain) assumption that the DM is distributed on such 
scales roughly like the galaxies , to estimate when galaxies form 
in this scenario. For a =  O, zgalaxies - 4, which is consistent 
with the observed existence of quasars at such redshifts .  But 
superclusters do not begin to collapse until z <  2, so one would 
not expect to find similar Lyman a absorption line redshifts for 
quasars separated by 4 l h-1 Mpc perpendicular to the line of sight 
(50) . 
Indeed, Sargent et al. (51) found no such correlations. 
This is additional evidence against hot DM. 
C. Potential Problems with Warm DM 
The warm DM hypothesis is probably consistent with the ob­
served features of typical large galaxies, whose formation would 
probably follow roughly the "core condensation in heavy halos" 
scenario (52 ,29 , 53) . The potentially serious problems with warm 
DM are on scales both larger and smaller than Mx• 
On large scales , 
the question is whether the model can account for the observed net­
work of filamentary superclusters enclosing large voids (23, 24) . 
A productive approach to this question may require sophisticated 
N-body simulations with N - 106 in order to model the large mass 
range that is relevant (54) . We will discuss this further in the 
next section in connection with cold DM, for which the same ques­
tion arises. 
On small scales, the preliminary indications that dwarf 

174 
J. R. PRIMACK AND G. R. BLUMENTHAL 
spheroidal galaxies have large DM halos (31-33) pose problems 
nearly as serious for warm as for hot DM. Unlike hot DM, warm DM 
is (barely) consistent with the phase space constraint (32-34) . 
But since free streaming of warm DM washes out fluctuations ox 
for M ੌMx - 1011Mઈ)> dwarf galaxies with M - 107 Ms can form in this 
picture only via fragmentation following the collapse of struc­
tures of mass -Mx, much as ordinary galaxies form from superslusters 
fragmentation in the hot DM picture. The problem here is that 
dwarf galaxies, with their small escape velocities -lOkm s-1, would 
not be expected to bind more than a small fraction of the X par­
ticles, whose typical velocity must be -102 km s-1 (- rotation 
velocity of spirals) . 
Thus we expect Mtot/Mlum for dwarf galaxies 
to be much smaller than for large galaxies - but the indications 
are that they are comparable (31-33) . Understanding dwarf galaxies 
may well be crucial for unravelling the mystery of the identity 
of the DM. Fortunately, data on Carina, another dwarf spheroidal 
companion of the Milky Way, is presently being analyzed (55) . 
VI. GALAXY FORMATION WITH COLD DM 
Damping of fluctuations by free streaming occurs only on 
scales too small to be cosmologically relevant for DM which either 
is not characterized by a thermal spectrum, or is much more massive 
than l keV. We refer to this as cold DM. 
A. Cold DM Candidates 
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with quarks of nonzero mass vio­
lates CP and T due to instantons. This leads to a neutron electric 
dipole moment that is many orders of magnitude larger than the 
experimental upper limit , unless an otherwise undetermined com-
plex phase eQCD is arbitrarily chosen to be extremely small .  Peccei 
and Quinn (56) have proposed the simplest and probably the most ap­
pealing way to avoid this problem, by postulating an otherwise 
unsuspected symmetry that is spontaneously broken when an associated 
pseudoscalar field - the axion (57) - gets a nonzero vacuum expecta­
tion value <¢a> - faei6 • This occurs when T - fa• Later , when the 
QCD interactions become strong at T - AQCD - 102 MeV, ins tan ton ef­
fects generate a mass for the axion ma = m1Tf7/fa .. 10-5 eV(l012 GeV /fd· 
Thereafter, the axion contribution to the energy density is (58) 
Pa = 3ma T3 f੍(Mpt AQcD)-1 • The requirement pW < Pcǽ implies that 
fa :S l01 2 GeV, and ma ;; lo-5 ev. 4 The longevity of helium-burning 
stars implies (59) that ma < lo-2 eV, fa > 109 GeV. Thus if the hypo­
thetical axion exists , it is probably important cosmologically, 
and for ma - 10-5 eV gravitationally dominant . 
(The mass range 
109-12 GeV, in which fa must lie, is also currently popular with 
particle theorists as the scale of supersymmetry (39) or family 
symmetry breaking, the later possibility connected with the axion 
(60) . )  

IMPLICATIONS FOR GALAXY FORMATION AND PARTICLE PHYSICS 
1 75 
Two quite different sorts of cold DM particles are also pos­
sible. One is a heavy stable "ino", such as a photino (41) of 
mass my >  2 GeV as discussed above. By a delicate adjustment of 
the theoretical parameters controlling the y mass and interactions, 
the ys can be made to almost all annihilate at high temperatures, 
leaving behind a small remnant that, because my is large, can con­
tribute a critical density today (14) . 
The second possibility may seem even more contrived: a 
particle, such as a vR• that decouples while still relativistic 
but whose number density relative to the photons is subsequently 
diluted by entropy generated in a first-order phase transition 
such as the Weinberg-Salam symmetry breaking (36) . (Recall that 
the mx bound in Fig. 1 assumes no generation of entropy. )  More 
than a factor ;; 103 entropy increase would over dilute n = nb/ny. 
if we assume n was initially generated by GUT baryosynthesis ; 
correspondingly, mx ;; 1 MeV , and Mx <: 106 M@ • 
Actually, it is not clear that we have a good basis to judge 
the plausibility of any of these DM candidates, since in no case 
is there a fundamental explanation - or, even better, a predic­
tion - for the ratio w = pgM/p੥um• which is known to lie in the 
range 10 $ w $ 102 • Two fundamental questions about the universe 
which the fruitful marriage of particle physics and cosmology has 
yet to address are the value of w and of the cosmological constant 
A. 
(We have here assumed A =  O, as usual. )  
B .  "Stagspansion" 
Peebles (49) has calculated the fluctuation spectrum for cold 
DM, with results that are well approximated by the expression 
a =  6 82 h-2 Mpc ,  S = 2 . 65 84 h-4 Mpc2 , 8 = T0/2. 7K. 
(15) 
This calculation neglects the massless neutrinos ; we find qualita­
tively similar results with their inclusion (61) . For an adiabatic 
Zeldovich (n = 1) primordial fluctuation spectrum, the spectrum of 
rms fluctuations in the mass found within a randomly placed sphere,5 
oM/M, is relatively flat for M < 109 Ͷ ,  a: M-1/6 (neff :: -2) for 
2/: 
109 M0 .s: M .s; 1012 M9, a: w 1/3 (neff :: - 1) for 1012 MQ .:: M .:> Meq • and a: M- 3 
(n = 1 ,  reflecting the primordial spectrum) for M .<: Meq• 
The flattening of the spectrum for M < Meg is a consequence of 
"stagspansion" ,3 the inihibition of the growtli of oDM for fluctua­
tions which enter the horizon when z > zeq• before the era of matter 
domination. 
In the conventional formalism (12,48, 62) - synchronous 

1 76 
J. R. PRIMACK AND G. R. BLUMENTHAL 
gauge, time-orthogonal coordinates - the fastest growing adiabatic 
fluctuations grow  a2 when they are larger than the horizon, When 
they enter the horizon, however, the radiation and charged particles 
begin to oscillate as an acoustic wave with constant amplitude 
( later damped by photon diffusion for M < Ms ilk) ,  and the neutrinos 
free stream away, As a result, the main source term for the growth 
of oDM disappears ,  and once the fluctuation is well inside the hori­
zon oDM grows only as (46) , (48 , PP"• 56-59) 
(16) 
until matter dominance (a ੎ aeq) ;  thereafter, oDH ੏a. Based on 
Eq. (16) , it has sometimes been erroneously remarked [also by the 
present authors (38) , alas] that there is only a factor of 2 . 5  
growth in oDM during the entire stagspansion regime, from horizon 
crossing until matter dominance. There is actually a considerable 
amount of growth in oDM just after the fluctuation enters the 
horizon, since donM/da is initially large and the photon and neu­
trino source terms for the growth of dark matter fluctuations do 
not disappear instantaneously. 
(See reference 61 for details. )  
This explains how (oM/M)nM can grow by a factor -30 between M 
and 109 ͵ .  
eq 
C. Galaxy Formation 
When o reaches unity, nonlinear gravitational effects become 
important. The fluctuation separates from the Hubble expansion, 
reaches a maximum radius , and then contracts to about half that 
radius (for spherically symmetric fluctuations) ,  at which point 
the rapidly changing gravitational field has converted enough 
energy from potential to kinetic for the virial relation <PE> 
- 2<KE> to be satisfied, 
(For reviews see (63) and (48) . )  
Although small-mass fluctuations will be the first to go non­
linear in the cold DM picture, baryons will be inhibited by pres­
sure from falling into them if M < MJ b• What is more important 
is that even for M > MJ b • the baryon੐ will not be able to contract 
further unless they can lose kinetic energy by radiation, With­
out such mass segregation between baryons and DM, the resulting 
structures will be disrupted by virialization as fluctuations_ 
that contain them go nonlinear (52) . Moreover, successively 
larger fluctuations will collapse relatively soon after one an­
other if they have masses in the flattest part of the ol1/M spectrum

Mtot - 109 M8 (65 ) . One can also deduce an ѥ bound on galaxy 
masses from the requirement that the cooling time be shorter than 
the dynamical time (64) ; with the same assumptions as before, this 
upper bound is Mtot ݽ 101 2  MQ (65) , 
It may be significant that this 
is indeed the range of masses of ordinary galaxies, 
The collapse 
of fluctuations of larger mass is expected in this picture to lead 
to clusters of galaxies ,  Only the outer parts of the member galaxy 
halos are stripped off; and the inner baryon cores continue to 
contract, presumably until star formation halts dissipation (29) . 6 
D. Potential Problems with Cold DM 
Dwarf galaxies with heavy DM halos are less of a problem in 
the cold than in the hot or warm DM pictures ,  There is certainly 
plenty of power in the cold DM fluctuation spectrum at small masses; 
the problem is to get sufficient baryon cooling and avoid disrup­
tion. Perhaps dwarf spheroidals are relatively rare because most 
suffered disruption, 
The potentially serious difficulties for the cold and warm 
DM pictures arise on very large scales , where galaxies are observed 
to form filamentary superclusters with large voids between them 
(23, 24) , These features have seemed to some authors to favor the 
hot DM model , apparently for two main reasons : 
(1) it is thought 
that formation of caustics of supercluster size by gravitational 
collapse requires a fluctuation power spectrum sharply peaked at 
the corresponding wavelength, and (2) the relatively low peculiar 
velocities of galaxies in superclusters are seen as evidence for 
the sort of dissipation expected in the baryonic shock in the 
"pancake" model .  Recent work by Dekel (67) suggests , however, 
that nondissipative collapse fits the observed features of super­
clusters. Results from N-body simulations with N - 106 (54) will 
soon show whether broad fluctuation spectra lead to filaments ,  
VII. 
SUMARY AND REFLECTIONS 
The hot ,  warm, and cold DM pictures are compared schematically 
in Fig, 2. Although only very tentative conclusions can be drawn 
on the basis of present information, it is our impression that the 
hot DM model is in fairly serious trouble. Maybe that is mainly 
because it has been the most intensively studied of the three pos­
sibilities considered here.

IMPLICATIONS FOR GALAXY FORMATION AND PARTICLE PHYSICS 
179 
Probably the greatest theoretical uncertainly in all three 
DM pictures concerns the relative roles of heredity vs. environ­
ment. For example, are elliptical galaxies found primarily in 
regions of high galaxy density, and disk £alaxies in lower density 
regions, because such galaxies form after the regions have under­
gone a large-scale dissipative collapse which provides the appro­
priate initial conditions , as in the hot DM picture? Or is it 
because disks form relatively iate from infall of baryons in an 
extended DM halo, which is disrupted or stripped in regions of 
high galaxy density? An exciting aspect of the study of large 
scale structure and DM is the remarkable recent increase in the 
quality and quantity of relevant observational data, and the 
promise of much more to come. 
Perhaps even more remarkable is the fact that this data may 
shed important light on the interactions of elementary particles 
on very small scales. Fig. 3 is redrawn from a sketch by Shelley 
Glashow which recently was reproduced in The New York Times 
Magazine (68) . Glashow uses the snake eating its tail - the uro­
boros, an ancient symbol associated with creation myths (69) -
to represent the idea that gravity may determine the structure of 
the universe on both the largest and smallest scales , 
But there 
is another fascinating aspect to this picture. There are left­
right connections across it : medium-small-to-medium-large, very­
small-to-very-large, etc. Not only does electromagnetism determine 
structure from atoms to mountains (70) , and the strong and weak 
interactions control properties and compositions of stars and 
solar systems. The dark matter, which is gravitationally domin­
ant on all scales larger than galaxy cores , may reflect fundamental 
physics on still smaller scales. And if cosmic inflation is to 
be believed, cosmological structure on scales even larger than 
the present horizon arose from interactions on the seemingly 
infinitesimal grand unification scale. 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Our interest in the subject of dark matter grew 
out of collaboration with Heinz Pagels (7 ,38) . 
In preparing this 
paper we benefited from conversations with N. Abrams , J.R. Bond, 
A. Dekel, M. Davis , G. Efstatiou, C. Frenk, D. Lin, J. Silk, 
A. Szalay, M. Turner. S. White, and especially from extensive 
discussions with S .  Faber at Santa Cruz and M. Rees at the Moriond 
Conference and subsequently. We received partial support from 
NSF grants and from the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics. 
FOOTNOTES 
1 .  This discussion is approximate. Since neutrino decoupling and 
e+e- annihilation so nearly coincide, there is actually a little 
heating of the neutrinos too (13) .

2. It is also possible that the DM is heavy stable neutrinos with 
mass ݼ 2 GeV, almost all of which would have annihilated (14) . 
This is a possible form of cold DM, discussed below. 
3. In economic "stagflation" , the economy stagnates but the econ­
omic yardstick inflates . The behavior of oDM during the "stag­
spansion" era is analogous : onM :: constant but a expanding. 
We suggest here the term stagspansion rather than stagflation 
for this phenomenon since it. occurs during the ordinary expan­
sion (Friedmann) era rather than during a possible very early 
"inflationary" (de Sitter) era.

One might worry that such a light particle could give rise to 
a force that at short distances (10-5 ev) -1 - 2 cm would be 
much stronger than gravity. But because the axion is pseudo­
scalar, its nonrelativistic couplings to fermions are 
- o • p .  
5 .  One calculates ok initially. 
In order to discuss masP L luctu­
ations it is more convenient to use oM/M than op/p, the Fourier 
transform of ok (49) . Note that there is a simple relation­
ship between \ op/p!2 and \ok \ 2 only for a power law fluctua-
tion spectrum \ ok I

6. The model presented by Peebles at the Moriond conference dif­
fers from that sketched here mainly in Peebles ' assumption 
that there is sufficient cooling from molecular hydrogen for 
baryon condensation to occur rapidly even on globular cluster 
mass scales.

COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON NEUTRINOS AND OTHER "INOS" AND THE 
"MISSING LIGHT" PROBLEM 
David N .  Schramm and Katherine Freese 
The University of Chicago 
ABSTRACT 
The arguments favoring non-baryonic dark matter are summar­
ized. Cosmological constraints are presented on the masses of 
neutrinos and other "inos" ,  where "ino" represents any candidate 
particle for the dark matter . A neutrino mass lOeV Ѥ m it, 25eV 
is favored for the most massive eigenstate, where the ͱpper lim­
it may be extended to 100 eV if one assumes weaker constraints 
on the age of the universe. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Over a decade ago massive neutrinos were suggested as pos­
sible candidates for the "missing mass" in the haloes of gal­
axiesl) . On larger and larger scales , less and less of the 
dynamically inferred mass can be accounted for by luminous mat­
ter2) . 
Some form of dark matter must reside in the haloes of 
galaxies and clusters of galaxies .  The density of "ordinary" 
nucleonic matter (faint stars, gas clouds, etc . )  that can con­
tribute to the missing mass is restricted by primordial nucleo­
synthetic arguments to 0 .  01 _:':_ ɺ _:':_ O . 14 3) .

stressed massive neutrinos as the least "ad hoc" possibility for 
the dark matter; other candidates include primordial black holes , 
axions , and supersymmetric particles like photinos . 
Experimental evidence for neutrino masses5) and neutrino 
oscillations6) as well as theoretical work in grand unified 
theories (for a review, see P .  Langacker7) ) further stimulated 
interest in massive neutrinos . Thੇ original Lubimov et a1 . 5) 
result of 14 eV  II\! 
 42 eV has been revised to ffiv = 3S-± 5 eV, 
although because of Uncertainties in the molecular effects , the 
mass may be as low as mv = 0. In any case, these results have 
not been verified in othੈr laboratories ,  and several experiments 
are in progress .  The negative results from oscillation experi­
ments place strict limits on the squared mass difference of neu­
trino species and the mixing angle. 
We will examine constraints on neutrino masses due to gen­
eralized cosmological arguments as well as specific models and 
look for masses consistent with all the arguments . After re­
viewing the necessary background material, a discussion of mass­
to-light ratios and density constraints , we discuss fermion den­
sities appropriate to neutrinos and to supersymmetric "inos", 
and find mass constraints from phase space arguments8) and res­
trictions on the age of the universe9 , 10,ll) . We examine the 
evolution in a neutrino-dominated universe of the adiabatic den­
sity perturbations that may be responsible for galaxy formation, 
in particular with large-scale structures forming first . Using 
the concept of the Jeans mass, the minimum mass that can collapse 
under its own self-gravity, we find constraints on masses of 
neutrinos and other ''inos" . The alternative hierarchical view 
with "cold" dark matter where small scales form first is also 
discussed . Among the alternative to massive neutrinos that have 
been proposed for the nonbaryonic dark matter are supersymmetric 
particlesl2) , axionsl3) , and primordial black holesl4) . We will 
argue that if the role of the large-scale structure is dominant 
as implied by the large voids and large clusters, dark matter 
should not differ significantly from massive neutrinos , either 
in mass or decoupling temperature. Although we will argue that 
low mass neutrinos are preferred for the large scales we will 
also point out that they encounter problems in understanding the 
smaller-scale structures as indicated by the correlation func­
tionl5) and the relative dynamical equilibration timescales of 
different size systems . Possible scenariosl6) which avoid these 
problems are discussed. Finally we discuss experimental implic­
ations and summarize the results . This talk summarizes the 32 
detailed results presented in the paper by Freese and Schramm )

In this section we will summarize the cosmological density 
arguments . 
Since the deceleration parameter q0 in the standard 
hot big bang model with zero cosmological constant (A = O) is 
estimated to range from 0 ± 0 . 5  to 1 . 5  ± 0 . 517) , an extreme up­
per limit to ã with A = 0 is ã  4 .  Dividing the mass of a 
bound system (obtained by application of the virial theorem) by 
its luminosity, one can obtain mass-to-light ratios (M/L) and 
estimates of matter contributions on different scales . Many 
authorsl8) find evidence for M/L increasing linearly with scale 
from M/L ė (1-2) for stars to M/L ė (300-800)h0 for rich clusters 
(see Table I, drawn largely from Faber and Gallagher2J ) .

one obtains a mass density (also listed in Table I) implied by 
assuming M/L on that scale applies to the average light of the 
universe . Davis et a1. 20) have suggested that the M/L curve 
may be approaching-a-;-asymptotic limit (perhaps Q = 1) on the 
scales of superclusters , while other authors21) believe that the 
curve flattens already on smaller scales. 
In any case the con-

200 
D. N. SCHRAMM AND K. FREESE 
sensus is that some form of dark matter dominates the dynamics 
of obj ects on scales larger than 100 kpc and, as shown by flat 
rotation curves , may be important on scales larger than 10 kpc . 
The above arguments are independent of whether or not the 
matter is baryonic . 
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis3) provides density 
constraints on the baryonic components . A lower limit on the a­
mount of bar)onic matter in the universe can be derived from com­
bined D and He abundances , dh 2 ƀ 0 . 01, and the observed 
abundances of 4He (mass fract1og Y  0 . 25) , D ,  and 7Li result in 
an upper limit to baryonic matter density , Qbh 2 < 0 . 034 . 
These 
0 
'\, 
arguments restrict baryonic matter to the range 
0 . 01  Qb  0 . 14 .  
( 2 . 2) 
Helium abundances from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis also constrain 
the number of neutrino species ; at most four low mass (  l MeV) , 
long-lived neutrino species are compatible with Y  0 . 26Ǒ and 
only three with the best observational limit of Y  0 . 25L2) . We 
know two of these experimentally , namely the \!e where 
IDv 
 60 eV and the Vµ where mv 
 570 ɸeV . 
The experimental 
ma§s limit on the \!T is mvT  2ͯ0 Mev23 . 
In this case we may 
already know all the neutrinos and other low mass "inos" which 
interact with the strength of neutrinos . 
Note , however ,  that 
the limit of three increases if the particle couples more weakly 
than the neutrino24) and thus decouples in the early universe at 
a temperature ƀ 100 MeV. 
If M/L really keeps increasing on scales larger than binar­
ies and small groups, then Q exceeds the upper limit on Qb and 
we are forced to say that the bulk of the matter in the universe 
is non-baryonic . 
While the general trend towards larger Q exists, 
and in this paper we will assume that Q is ƀ 0 . 15 ,  the situation 
is by no means settled ; there is still a possibility that 
Q < 0 . 15 and everything is barΣonic , as emphasized by Gott et al . 25) 
One should note that inflation 6) explicitly predicts Q = 1 .000:-. .  
and thus requires non-baryonic matter . 
On the basis of "sim­
plicity" we believe that a nonbaryonic universe with Q ;;:, 0 . 15 
should satisfy Q = 1 .

chemical equilibrium at temperature TD when the reaction rates 
for their production (e . g .  e+e-
ڧ fT) can no longer keep up 
with the expanΤion of the universe . 
By entropy conservation it 
can be shown27 that neutrino (TV) and photon (Ty) tem2eratures 
after e+e- annihilation are related by T 
= (4/11) 1/JT , where-
as the temperatur/ of other fermions is gͮven by 
y 
Tf = T (3. 9/g*t) l 3 for Ty << meǑ where g*f is the number of rel­
ativistic species at decoupling . L4) 
The value of the number density in the present epoch for a 
species of neutrinos which are relͭtivistic at decoupling is 
given by nv . = 109 cm-3( Tyo ) 3 (i = e, µ ,  T and Ty0 is photon

and the energy density in units of the 
(3 . 2) 
where mv 
is the mass of a neutrino species . 
If the sum of the 
masses 
i of different neutrino species exceeds  100 h 2 eV 
the universe is closed . 
Requiring S1  4 and h 
 1 givgs only 
the weak limit , l m  400 eV ; we will see thaͬ age of the uni­

(3. 3) 
where the equality sign corresponds to the largest value of 
baryonic matter density consistent with element abundances from 
primordial nucleosynthesis , Qbh 2  0 . 034 . 
Hence if the sum of 
the neutrino masses exceeds a fgw eV , neutrinos are the dominant 
matter in the universe and must play an important role in galaxy 
formation . 
The above discussion of fermion number densities assumes 
the fermions are relativistic at decoupling . 
For neutrinos more 
massive than a few MeV or for other fermions whose mass exceeds 
their decoupling temperature , the mass density falls roughly as 
mf-1 . 85 28) . 
Thus total density limits S1 if, 4 can be satisfied 
for sufficiently massive (m Ü 1 GeV) particles , while if 
l mV · ¸ 20 GeV the density ͫas fallen so low that neutrinΥs) can­
i 
l not be the dominant matter . 
Krauss29) and Goldberg O 
have recently shown that for certain supersymmetric particles 
the annihilation rates can be slower than those for neutrinos , 
and the mass limits are pushed to even higher values . 
Following 
Gunn et al . 3l) for these very massive particles the appropriate 
mass density one has to worry about exceeding is the density of 

202 
D. N. SCHRAMM AND K. FREESE 
matter in groups of galaxies ( st  < 0 . 13) not the total density 
of the universe (since as we will-see these massive particles 
must cluster on small scales , in ways such that baryons are good 
tracers of their presence . 
This yields rn G 6 GeV for neutrinos 
and corresponding higher limits for photiXos .

By the inversion of this age argument ,  an

verse . 
For example , if Lubimov et a1 . 5) are correct and 
mv · 30 eV, then the universe must be younger than 12 Gyr .

Similar constraints can also be found on the masses of other 
fermions which decouple while still relativistic and are candidates 
for the dark matter ; for this analysis see Freese and Schramm32) 
as well as Olive and Turner33) . 
For all standard unified models 
with g*f Ĳ 161 , the limit from our best fit age argument does not 
allow mf to exceed 400 eV, contrary to the limits in previous 
papers (l2) . 
Tremaine and Gunn8) have used phase space arguments to obtain 
a restriction on neutrino masses . 
The smaller the scale on which 
neutrinos are confined , the larger the velocity dispersion, and. 
the easier it is for neutrinos to escape from the region . 
A 
necessary (but not sufficient) condition for trappine neutrinos 
on the scale of clusters is the requirement ڤv Ŷ 5h0Yz eV, on the 
scale of binaries and small groups mv F 14h Yz eV, and in gal­
axies mv G 20 eV . 
If massive neutrinos are0to solve the missing 
mass problem they must be trapped at least on scales of clusters 
of galaxies , i . e. , m G 3 eV . 
Of course to actually trap them 
requires some clusteΩ formation scenarios . 
Possibilities will 
be addressed in the next two sections , where it will be shown

that this lower limit can probably be strengthened for any 
realistic scenario . 
IV . ADIABATIC PERTURBATIONS 
The formation of galaxies requires the clumping of baryons ; 
i . e . ' enhancements ob 
opb in the baryon density over the back-
ground value must grow from small values in the early universe 
to nonlinearity (ob > 1) by the present-day to achieve the forma­
tion of bound structure . 
In the adiabatic mode the baryon per­
turbations ob are accompanied by radiation perturbations 0 ' 
whereas in the isothermal mode initially oy << ob . 
In genetal 
any primordial fluctuation scheme for galaxy formation can be 
treated as a superposition of these two independent modes . 
Thus 
in the adiabatic theory of galaxy formation, initially 
0 
= 0 
= &v = Á- o b (where oi = opi/pi describes the density 
eͩhanceͨent of particle species i in a perturbation over the 
background value) . 
These fluctuations grow together outside the 
horizon, and once inside the horizon their evolution depends on 
the value of the Jeans mass . 
The Jeans mass is the smallest mass unstable to gravitational 
collapse . 
It is given by the rest mass of particles in a sphere 
of radius equal to the Jeans length AJ ' the scale on which rad­
iation pressure forces just balance gravitational forces .

Figure 2 we have plotted the evolution of neutrino (MJ ) anΪ

Neutrino perturbationͧ on scales ڢ MvM can grow once Ϋάe 
neutrinos become the dominant matter . However , Bond et al . 3 
have shown that neutrino perturbations on scales smaller than 
MvM are strongly damped by free-streaming of the neutrinos out 
of dense regions (Landau damping) .  Only perturbations on scales 
larger than M M can survive and grow to nonlinearity36) . 
To 
enable the formation of large-scale structure, we require this 
damping scale to be smaller than the largest structure observed , 
superclusters of mass ı 1016 M0 , i . e . , MvM Ĳ M c ı 1016 M0 .

power spectrum . 
Although the peak of the power structure is the 
scale on which perturbations first go nonlinear , significant pow­
er may exist on somewhat smaller or larger scales .

In a universe with one massive neutrino species this requires 
m\! · 10 eV. 
If there are three species of neatrinos with equal mass ,  the mass 
of each species must satisfy mv .  Ü 1 6  eV, giving a sum of masses 
l mv .  Ü 48 eV. This is not compatible with the requirement 
1L mੁ.  25 eV from consistency of all the arguments restricting 
the age of the universe . A "best fit" model does not allow all 
the neutrino masses to be equal . Of course if we relax our age 
constraint to tu > 8 . 7  Gyr then equal masses are allowed . 
If 
larger scales than M\!M in Eq . (4 . 3) reach nonlinearity first and 
tidally strip the smaller scales , the limit on the mas ses only 
becomes more restrictive . 
In this adiabatic picture with massive neutrinos ,  the smal­
lest scales to form initially are large clusters , and smaller 
scales come from later cooling and fragmentation. The alternative 
model of galaxy formation, where small scales form first and 
cluster hierarchically onto larger and larger scales , has not 
been shown to give rise to the observed structu3ੂ on large scales , 
namely the large voids seen by Kirshner et al . 3 ) as wel l  as 
large clusters and filaments . Also , dark matter which clusters 
first on small scales will yield a constant M/L ; however ã t 1 
for the universe is possible only if M/L continues to increase 
with scale, or if there are regions with M/L larger than any 
measured value. If , indeed, small scale damping is required for 
the formation of large-scale structure, we also get a lower limit 
on the Jeans mass . Note that the necessity for small-scale damp­
ing has not been rigorously proven. The failure of the attempts 
of Frenk, White, and Davisl5J to have hierarchical pictures work 
and the ease with which their small-scale damped models succeed 
in giving rise to observed large-scale structure is certainly 
suggestive if not compelling . Damping those scales smaller than 
cluster sizes,

for the mas s  of any non-interacting particle proposed for the 
dominant matter (for an alternative approach to similar results 
see (39) ) .  For particles decoupling earlier than neutrinos the 
number density is lower, and hence to conserve the inequality in 
Eq . (4 .4) , the restriction on the mas s  only becomes tighter . 
If 
valid, this argument rules out the high mass branch, mf ڡ 6 GeV 
for the dominant matter (if Q 
! 1) , since such high mass particles 
would cluster first on very small scales and would not explain 
the large voids or large M/L (this does not mean such particles 
cannot exist ; it merely means that their contribution to Q must 
be small ,  0 . 2) . This argument would also rule out gravitinos 
or other supersymmetric particles in the keV mass range. 
Since our primary motivation for non-baryonic matter is to 
get a large Q , this upper limit on the mas s  of our candidate 
particle becomes quite constraining. As we mentioned in Section 
III, the number density of any species , nf, decreases roughly 
stepwis੃ with increasing decoupling temperature TD for that 
particle24) . Given low particle masses mf , in order to keep a 
high Q ,  where Q 
! mfnf/pc , the decoupling temperature Tf must 
also be low. Quantitatively , the constraint mf  200 eV and 
Q

In other words ,  in the favored 
model where Q is large ( Q 
! 1) and large-scale structure forms 
first, the universe is probably dominated by particles which be­
have in all ways like massive neutrinos . 
Any candidate particle for the dominant matter decoupling 
at TD  100 MeV is constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis argu­
ments in exactly the same way as neutrinos . We have seen in 
Section II that it is very difficult to add to the three known 
neutrino species a full additional neutrino type (or equivalently 
g* 
= 7 / 4 additional degrees of freedom, where one bosonic spin 
state contributes g* 
= 1 and one fermionic spin state contributes 
g* = 7/8) without violating limits on the observed 4He abundance .  
Thus i t  i s  probable that the dominant matter i s  a neutrino and 
not some other "ino" . Axions have been proposed for the dark 
matter, 13) but since they have a low Jeans mass they cannot be 
the dominant matter if the large voids require large scales form­
ing first .  These arguments would also prevent small (planetary 
mass) black holes from being the dominant matter unless they were 
able to stimulate Ostriker-Cowie40) explosionsl4) .

The formation of structure in the universe requires the 
growth of perturbations from small amplitudes in the early uni­
verse to nonlinearity (8p/p > 1) by the present day . 
In the 
standard adiabatic picture of galaxy formation without massive 
neutrinos , the coupling of baryons to photons before recombina­
tion damps the pΟrturbations on sc'?i\es smaller than the Silk mass,

, and prevents perturbations 
from growing on larger scales . 
After recombination at 1 + zRı 1000 
the surviving perturbations in an Einstein-de-Sitter universe 
grow as (1 + z) -1 , allowing a growth factor of only about 1000 be­
tween recombination and the present day . 
To reach nonlinearity 
by today , the perturbations must have been (8p/p)b 
t lo-3 at re­
combination. The resulting microwave anisotropy 8T/T t l/3 (8p/p)b 
 1/3 x 10-3 would be larger than the observed large-scale aniso­
tropy , ͥ 2 x lo-4 . 
This dilemma is resolved in a universe dom­
inated by massive neutrinos or other "inos" 4l) After the neutrinos 
become the dominant matter at 1 + zM ( 1900 m 
(time tM) ,  neutrino 
perturbations grow as (1 + z) -1 on scales larɷer than the maximum 
neutrino Jeans mass , M ڠ MvM· 
Baryon perturbations are tied to 
the photons until after the time of recombination (tR) ,  when they 
can rapidly catch up to the neutrino perturbations . 
This extra 
growth period for neutrino perturbations allows nonlinearity by 
the present epoch with 8v (tR)

The microwave anisotropy , now only 8 T /T

no longer 
violates the observed limit as long as mv ¸ 1 eV . 
Before leaving the adiabatic mode , it is worthwhile to re­
member that GUT s naturally allow adiabatic perturbations but not 
isothermal ones42) . 
All attempts at producing isothermals in the 
context of GUT s have been very ad hoc and unnatural 43) 
In fact 
inflationary scenarios seem naturally to give rise to adiabatic 
perturbations44) with a Zel ' dovich spectrum, i . e .  fluctuations 
come within the horizon at constant although model-dependent 
amplitude . 
HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING 
The alternative to condensing large scales first is to build 
up from small scales . 
We discuss this because the adiabatic pan­
cake scheme of the previous section does not by itself lead to the 
small scale structure . 
Such structure requires subsequent cooling 
and fragmentation of the baryons while leaving the non-interacting 
neutrinos on the large scale where they produce the large M/L . 
These cooling and fragmentation processes are not well understood , 

COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON NEUTRINOS AND OTHER "INOS" 
209 
so many ad hoc assumptions are required . 
On the other hand , iso­
thermal perturbations naturally produce these small scales down 
all the way to the scale of globular clusters . 
The hierarchical 
picture , whether produced by isotherrnals or by adiabatics with a 
small "ino" Jeans mass so that small scales form first , does 
correctly fit the 2 and 3 point galaxy correlation functions15) 
up to cluster scales of Ý 5 Mpc . 
To fit this in the simple pan­
cake picture (with no cooling or fragmentation assumptions) re­
quires a fine tuning of the parameters or at least a very small 
Jeans mass that is not needed in a hierarchical scheme . 
If neu­
trionos make the large scales first then galaxies might not form 
until redshifts z < 1 ,  but quasars are seen with z Ý 3 . 5 .  In 
addition, the equilibration time scale can be determined from the 
dynamics of galaxies on various scales and it is found that the 
largest scales are not in dynamical equilibrium yet , whereas small 
scales are . 
For example , the core of the Virgo Cluster as well as 
the Corna Cluster are well virialized , whereas the Virgo Super­
cluster is not .  This might argue in favor of isotherrnals or at 
least a hierarchical picture with small ( ,{, 108 i10) Jeans mass as 
given by axions , GeV mass photinos , or planetary mass black holes . 
But as we 've already seen GUT s argues against isotherrnals and the 
large scale voids , superclusters , and İ  1 argue against any 
hierarchical picture on the largest scales (hierarchical models 
produce constant M/L) . 
One might suggest a solution where the adiabatic picture holds 
but there are two significant nonbaryonic particles , the dominant 
one a 10 to 25 eV neutrino and the second a particle such as the 
axion or massive gravitino which has a small Jeans mass and yields 
the small scale structure. Such a model is certainly possible but 
seems very ad hoc in that we require new particles to solve each 
problem. Alternatively , some new hierarchical model may be dev­
eloped with tidal stripping and a power spectrum which, contrary 
to previous attempts , does produce the large scale structure and 
enables İ  1 .  We feel the most likely model is one in which the 
adiabatic picture holds and cooling and fragmentation of the bar­
yons is enhanced at the intersection of caustics16J . 
In this case 
galaxy formation occurs in filaments . 
Fry46) has shown that the 
galaxy correlation functions for filaments agrees with the observed 
2 and 3 point galaxy correlation functions as well as the hierar­
chical case. To meet the time scale constraints one merely has to 
argue that within the filaments distant regions will take longer 
to equilibrate than central ones . 
Of course , a low density uni­
verse with İ < 0 . 15 and only baryons is also a possibility . 
Scenarios Qf mixed isothermal and adiabatic components are also 
possible47J ; since the adiabatic mode grows more quickly , the 
resulting large-scale structure is essentially that of the adia­
batic picture .

COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON NEUTRINOS AND OTHER "INOS"

Table II gives a summary of the arguments for different possible 
constituents of the universe . 
A universe with İ F 0 . 15 must 
probably be dominated by non-baryonic matter , although the ob­
servational evidence pointing in this direction is not without 
loopholes . The galaxy formation mode compatible with GUT s ,  name­
ly the adiabatic mode, produces disagreement with the 3K back­
ground unless the universe is dominated by non-baryonic matter . 
We also mentioned that Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the 
number of neutrinos to at most 4 ,  probably only 3 .  
Merely from limits on the total mass density o f  the universe , 
neutrino masses are restricted to two ranges ,  7 m 
.t 400 eV or 
T 
\) •  
ż .  {, 6 GeV (corresponding arguments for otheil- "in2's" depend on 
thਸir decoupling temperatures) . However , applying an additional 
age constraint at tu > 8 . 7  Gyr, we find a stricter limit

If we further restrict the age by requiring 
consistency between globular cluster ages , observed helium abund­
ances and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis , then t > 13 Gyr and 
4 m\! .  -2_ 25 eV ( l 
m. 
 400 eV) (remembਹr age arguments assume 
i

/\ = 0) . 
We mentioned that the Tremaine and Gunn8) phase space argu­
ment gives a necessary (but not sufficient) limit of m > 3 eV 
if neutrinos are to cluster on cosmologically significѣn਺ scales . 
In the GUT s favored adiabatic scenario, we showed that a maximum 
neutrino Jeans mass small enough to allow the formation of super­
clusters requires m\! > 10 eV . For three neutrino species of equal 
mass , the limit becomes more restrictive , mv .  > 16 eV (L m > 48 eV) . 
l 
i \)i 
Hence three equal neutrino masses are allowed only for a universe 
younger than 12 Byr, an age excluded by the best fit age arguments . 
Based on the conclusions of Frenk, White , and Davisl5) that the 
formation of large-scale structure required small-scale damping, 
a potentially far-reaching argument was presented that the mass of 
the dominant particle be less than ɂ 200 eV . In a high density 
universe of ਻਼ 1 ,  with T 
= 2 . 7K, a particle with this mass 
and gf _:_ 2 decouples at T6° 100 MeV; in other words the dominant 
matter is similar to a massive neutrino . 
The nucleosynthetic 
constraint that there are probably only 3 neutrinos leads to the 
conclusion that not only does the dominant particle act like a 
massive neutrino but it probably is one . The mass for this best 
fit neutrino is 10 < m < 25 eV. While the adiabatic picture with 
massive neutrinos s਽ccਾsਿfully gives the large scale structure , 
some problems exist on smaller scales . Various speculative models 
are given which might solve the small scale problems while re­
taining a solution to the large scale . We feel the most promising 
is the scheme of Bond, Centrella, Szalay and Wilsonl6) , which 

212 
D. N. SCHRAMM AND K. FREESE 
investigates the cooling and fragmentation of pancakes into gal­
axies . 
It will be interesting to see whether subsequent work 
verifies this model . 
In the most likely scenario the most massive neutrino would 
have a mass 10 eV ¶ l1\J ¶ 25 eV while the other neutrinos would 
have negligible masses . 
If the Lubimov et al . 5) result holds 
then we may have found the answer , massive V with m

most massive, because these are weak rather than mass eigenstates , 
depending on the mixing matrix any combination of leptons might 
be involved in the most massive eigenstate . Ushida ڟ al . 64)

(90% confidence level) . This suggests that eithơr the iliixing angle 
is very small, that limits on the age of the universe from globular 
clusters must be reevaluated (although all current possible cor­
rections go towards longer , not shorter ages) , or that there is 
some form of dark matter other than the three known neutrino 
species . Unfortunately , if the mass eigenstates is close to VI 
and the mixing angle is small , the experimental detection of the 
dominant matter in the universe may take a long time .

INTRODUCTION 
Dissipation of inf alling gas into a preexisting dark halo of non­
dissipative matter provides an attractive scenario for the 
formation of disk galaxies. Tidal torquing of gas against the 
gravitationally dominant dark halo can account for the observed 
angular momentum (Fa ll and Efstathiou, 1980) , if halos form by 
hierarchical clustering in the expanding universe (c.f. White and 
Rees, 
1978) . 
Moreover 
recent 
observations 
demonstrate that 
galactic bulges and the less luminous ellipticals are rotationally 
supported (Davies et al. 1983) , suggesting that this model may 
have more widespread application. 
Given these and other attractive features of dissipation in a dark 
halo, two possibilities come to mind for forming such dark halos . 
White and Rees (1978) proposed that the first bound systems 
consisted of low luminosity remnants of Population III and 
represented the dominant mass constituents of the universe. The 
dark remnants clustered hierarchically as the universe expanded to 
provide dark potential wells on galactic and subgalactic scales 
into which dissipative infall of gaseous matter eventual ly gave 
rise to the observed galaxies. An attractive feature of this 
scheme was the natural emergence of the luminous mass-scale of a 
typical bright galaxy (Rees and Os triker 1977, Silk 1977) .

C. NORMAN AND J. SILK 
The mos t implausible aspect of this scheme is the formation_ of 
sufficiently dark potential wel ls from the initial generation of 
Population III star formation. Current ideas on primordial star 
formation suggest that stars of mass ݶ 0 .1 M0 should form in 
cons iderable numbers (Kashlinsky and Rees 1983 , Silk 1983) and 
would violate observational constraints if present in sufficient 
numbers to dominate the mass density of the universe. A further 
difficulty has arisen with the realisation that somewhat contrived 
initial conditions may be required to yield a hierarchical 
clustering scheme 
for galaxy 
formation based on primordial 
fluctuations in the context of baryonic synthesi s  models ( Bond et 
al. 1982) , since these yield a universal va lue of the speciflC 
entropy. Adiabatic fluctuations , on the other hand, may arise 
spontaneously in certain inflationary models of the very early 
universe ; in any event they are preserved during baryon synthesis . 
Moreover, the evolution of primordial adiabatic fluctuations which 
possess a large initial coherence length apparently do give a more 
satisfactory fit to the large scale irregularities observed in the 
galaxy 
distribution 
than 
the 
isothermal 
fluctuation 
theory 
(Klyphin and Shandarin 1983, Frenk et al. 1983) , although a late 
galaxy formation epoch (z - 1 )  appears to be mandatory . Finally ,  
non baryonic forms of matter such as massive neutrinos (Marx and 
Szalay 1972) and gravitinos ( Pagels and Primak 1982) have emerged 
as interesting candidates for the dark matter. Initially motivated 
by tentat ive indications of a finite neutrino res t mas s  ( Lyubimov 
et al. 1980 ;  Reines et al. 1980) this idea has been reinforced by 
the growing realisation of elementary particle physicists that the 
existence of exotic particles predicted by theory should have 
cosmological implications that can often give the mos t  s ignificant 
bounds on their properties . A massive neutrino (and to a conside­
rable extent, gravitino) dominated universe leads natural ly to 
anisotropic pancake 
collapse models , 
with 
the 
first 
bound 
structures forming on very large scales associated with super­
clusters 
or 
clusters of galaxies, 
and ensuing fragmentation 
resulting in galaxy formation ( Doroshkevich et al. 1981) . 
This type of scheme has me t with sufficient success in reproducing 
the observed galaxy distribution that we reexamine here the issue 
of dark halo formation. One of the most emphasised aspects of the 
pancake theory of galaxy formation is that the firs t protogalactic 
fragments form in a highly compressed baryonic pancake ( Sunyaev 
and Zel 'dovich 1972) . Dark halos develop by slow infal l of mass ive 
neutrinos that have not been heated during the initial collapse 
with numerical es timates suggesting that halo trapping efficien­
cies of up to 10 percent of the neutrino matter are attainable 
(Bond et al. 1983, Melott 1983) . Collisionless damping and phase 
mixing erases all pre existing structure in the neutrino distribu­

would seem then that pancake theory does not provide any possi­

In what follows, we first discuss the efficiency of massive 
neutrino accretion by baryonic cores ( II) . We then show how 
neutrino halos may form prior to baryonic inf all ( I II) , and 
final ly review the implications of our results ( IV) . 
II AcrέETION BY BARYONIC CORES 
A large number of one-dimensional simulations of the Vlasov 
equation were performed more than a decade ago in orde r to study 
violent relaxation (c . f .  Lecar 19 72) . These simulations demon­
strated that the asymptotic energy distribution attained a core­
halo structure that was more pronounced than that predicted by 
Lynden-Bell 's ( 1967) 
theory of 
violent relaxation. A spiral 
structure generally developed in phase space, and only after 
several crossing t imes had elapsed, did the phase space density 
become significantly diluted, 
resulting in significant phase 
mixing. A s imilar effect has been noted in the development of the 
one-dimensional beam plasma instability; the forma l  analogy with 
the gravitational system has been discussed by Berk and Roberts 
( 1 9 70) . Of 
particular interest are the simulations of Janin 
( 1 9 7 1 ) ,  who 
studied 
Jeans 
instability in a one-dimensional 
collapse and who found that an initially smooth system was stable 
to fragmentation, even though it was formal ly Jeans unstable. Only 
when init ial fluctuations were introduced did the system in fact , 
become Jeans unstable. 
A natural source for fluctuations in the adiabatic collapse model 
of galaxy formation is pancake fragmentation. The dissipative 
component naturally develops structure that can drive instability 
in the dissipationless components as discussed for example by 
Ikeuchi et al. ( 1 9 72) . Th is effect has been found to occur in one­
dimensional s imulations of neutrino streaming in the presence of 
discrete fragments (Bond et al. 1983) . Simi lar effects occur in 
two-dimensional s imulations ( Melott 1982) . However these calcula­
t ions fail to incorporate the growing anisotropy of the neutrino 
velocity distribution which provides a strong source of heati ng in 
the collapse direction. It is this heating which is largely 
responsible for l imiting accretion and not the multiple streams . 

218 
C. NORMAN AND J. SILK 
The importance of anisotropic heating for the neutrinos has 
recently been emphasized by Zel 'dovich and Shandarin ( 1 982) who 
note that it limits the maximum neutrino density. Here we develop 
a s imple analytic model which takes account of anisotropic heating 
and allow for one dimensional mixing of the neutrino streams . 
Since phase space density is incompressible and the structure in 
phase space is generically a two-armed spiral, phase mixing will 
occur rapidly when adjacent spirals touch. Ass uming equally spaced 
spirals with constant pitch angle and constant width, correspon­

We assume that the infalling neutrinos form an extended isothermal 
structure with velocity dispersion of order that of the central 
baryonic core. In this case, accretion will no longer occur once 
the neutrino velocity dispersion rises above that of the core. 
This cut-off occurs at t ime - t0 (ɳ)n, and sets a lower limit

Therefore MJ emerges as a natural baryonic mass scale. tiaryonic 
fragments caɵ grow by coalescence from smaller scales produced in 
the initial fragmentation, and we infer that MJv should represent 
a characteristic baryonic mass. The amount of dark halo matter 
accreted by such fragments is determined by the competition for

III BLACK POTENTIAL WELLS 
Baryonic fragments are capable of driving large fluctuations in 
the neutrino density as 
we now demonstrate. Consider a pancake 
after baryonic fragments have formed and nrultiple cold neutrino 
streams are still present. Ti.e neutrino density enhancement 
produced by a baryonic f ragment due to gravitational focussing of 
the wake of a cold neutrino stream is considerable. The exact 
calculation of the density profile on the symmetry axis behind a 
baryonic fragment is given by ( Danby and Camm, 1967)

the abCZive \I condition should be satisfied 'by some of the baryonic 
f ragments that accumulate in the central layer. Incorporation of 
the detailed velocity and density profile of a pancake can reduce 
M 
by an order of magnitude of two. 
Black potential welis 
rotlɬly of order the initial Jeans mass can form in the wake. 
These bound neutrino clouds can be convected with the flow and 
thus be distributed throughout the pancake s tructure. 
Note that the condition that the background Hubble flow in the 
plane of the pancake can be neglected is obtained from using the 
impuls ive 
approximation 
to 
be ɭ - ɮBR > 1 where p R is 
the 
pancake co lumn density and pB is tͣe me/n density of J?i baryonic 
fragment. For such an increased baryonic column density there must 
have been substantial dissipation and three dimensional collapse 
of the baryonic fragment. 
Consider now 
the likely 
evolution of baryonic matter that 
dissipates and is accreted by these black potential wells. We 
expect that star formation will only occur once the baryonic 
density exceeds the neutrino density . The apparent core size of 
the resulting stellar system can be much less than the core of 
neutrino 
cloud. 
The 
ind ividual 
stars 
are 
effect ively 
tes t 
particles in a nearly constant density core and exhibit harmonic 
oscillator motion. Straightforward application of the equations of 
spherical, 
isotropic, 
stellar hydrodynamics for the non-self­
gravitating material with an isothermal equation of state yields 
the temperature distribution for a given density profile. 
Let us suppose that dwarf spheroidal and elliptical galaxies are 
to be identified with the result of dissipative baryonic infall 
into these dark potentional wells. We do not restrict our 
attention to massive neutrinos but consider gravitinos as wel l  as 
other collisionless particles as candidates for the role of dark 
matter. The peculiar role of massive neutrinos in dwarf galaxies 
is discussed in the following section. Now, the light profiles of 
dwarf ellipticals can be fitted by a tidally- truncated Hubble 
profile. An equally good fit to the light distribution is given by 
an exponential prof ile (Faber and Lin 1983) and we have derived a 
radial temperature dependeΓce in both cases .  For the density 
prof ile pB - e -ar 2wz -ΔY12d ob 
a 1 + aͤ and fzir2 the ana_ytic King 
prof ile pB - ( l+B r ) 
we 
find ob 
a l +B r where B 
is 
the 
core-radius. We interpret this temperature rise with increasing 
radius as an indication of the role of the dissipation that 
occured when the stars formed in the dark potential wel l. 
The result ing stellar system should resemble dwarf galaxies but 
embedded 
in 
dark 
potential 
wells .

dispersion increase with radius is testable if enough velocity 
dispersion data for individual stars is available. Current data on 
one dwarf spheroidal do not appear to be inconsistent with this 
prediction (Aaronson 1983) . 
Another prediction of our model comes from consideration of the 
rotational velocity of gas within a neutrino halo. The rotation 
curves will always resemble solid body rotation within a uniform 
density neutrino core. Indeed Tul ly et al. 
( 1978) find that 
several dwarf irregular galaxies display solid body rotation in HI 
emission out to the edge of the light distribution. This is 
generally the case for all observations of dwarf galaxy rotation 
curves we are aware of at present. 
IV IMPLICATIONS FOR COSMINOS 
Can the masses of dwarf ga laxies indeed be explained by dark halos 
of massive cosminos ,  such as neutrinos or gravitinos? The mass-to­
light ratios of seven sphen idal dwarfs were estimated on the 
basis of t idal radii to be 
- 30, with at least one high velocity 
dwarf exceeding 100 ( Faber and Lin 1983) . Measurement of a lower 
bound to the velocity dispersion in Draco of 6 .5 km s-l obtained 
from three carbon s tars led Aaronson to directly infer that 
M/L "' 30 for Draco. 
However, these authors noted the following serious objection to 
accounting for the dark halos with mass ive neutrinos .  According to 
an argument given by Tremaine and Gunn (1979) , the coarse-grained 
phase space density of the neutrino distribution cannot increase 
during dynamical processes associated with galaxy 
formation. 
Knowing the maximum phase space density ,  one can then infer a 
lower bound on the neutrino mass for specified core parameters , 
notably radius and velocity dispersion. Using the observed values , 
a lower bound on m was found to be 
- 600 eV in the case of Draco 
( Lin and Faber 19ɢ3) . Similar conc lusions applied to the othe r 
dwarfs.

The total mass of Draco is now - 5 x 1010 M0 ; its mas s-to-light

may only be directly seeing the trace of a vastly more massive

Indeed 
the 
apparent 
longevity of close binary pairs of galaxies when confronted with a 
s imilar constraint, suggests that a common dark halo may develop 
(Sharp and White 1977) . Such may als o  be the case here, of course.

of

including finite size effects is evidently required to establish a

Such a dramatic conclusion depends on our faith in massive 
neutrinos . 
Gravitinos

a 
dynamically

epoch by pancake-like collapse. In this case our pancake frag­

( - 103-104) for dwarfs. In general, the4 mass-to-light ratio of 
dwarfs is toos ted by a factor(SOO eV/m ) , where m can be taken 
to be one 's favourite candidate for ma͡s ive parti͠les that Ηre 
once in thermal equilibrium with the background radiation. 
Fragmentation of the dark matter may also be possible on much 
larger scales than those of dwarf galaxies. One poss ible mechanism 
is the two-stream instability as in the Jeans instability in the 
plane 
of 
the 
pancake. 
For 
homogeneous 
systems 
both 
these 
instabilities will occur. 'Th.e two-stream instability will be 
generated when the cold neutrinos stream through a background gas 
with a velocity that is supersonic with respect to the sound speed 
in the gas (Ikeuchi ڝ al. 1974, Sweet, 1962, Lynden-Bell, 1967) . 
As we have argued here, the velocity dispersions during pancaking 
will become highly anisotropic ( see als·o Ze l' dovich and Shandarin, 
1982) and for the homogeneous problem, instability will arise in 
the plane on a scale of order the Jeans length in the plane. This 
is also true for the self-gravitating slab (Kulsrud and Mark, 
1970) . The problem we face here is that because the pancake is a 
very highly inhomogeneous , t ime-variable syst em with large scale 
f low both in (Hubble flow) and normal to the plane, we have a 
classical 
fragmentation 
problem. 
The 
result 
is 
intuit ively 
op/p - pn with n positive and of order unity and if fluctuation 
exist then fragmentation and collapse will occur at op/p - 1 .  It

is not certain that these instabilities could grow sufficiently 
rapidly to generate Sp/p - 1 perturbation from noise. However, if 
they do, then nuch more massive black halos are possible and we 
shall briefly consider this possibility. 
One other example of a galaxy with an exceptionally high mass-to­
light ratio may be the intergalactic cloud in Leo recently 
discovered by Schneider et al. (l 9P-i3) .  The gravitational mass of 
this system is inferred to be- 10 M and failure to detect any 
underlying galaxy (Kibblewhite, pri'9ate communication) implies 
M/LB :C: 300. 
In summary , we have found that the Jeans mass for the dominant 
component of collisionless particles at the onset of pancaking 
determined the lower limit to baryonic core masses which can 
subsequently grow halos. For pancaking at redshift Z - 5 this 
corresponds2{f the core of a typical luminous galaxy ɚnd varies 
as - (l+Zp) 
• Smaller cores that have accreted halos must have 
formed from more recently collapsed pancakes. These baryonic cores 
form prior to halo accretion, and form moreover near the mid plane 
of the pancake. We have also found that the fragmenting baryonic 
layer drives the formation of dark potential wells in the 
neutrinos. These potential wells can subsequently accrete gas ,  and 
considerations of dissipative infall led us to identify them with 
dwarf spheroidal galaxies. 
The more massive examples of such dark clouds may also be 
observable as X-ray sources containing hot gas. Star formation 
would be inhibited until the accreted gas locally dominates the 
gravitational potential. We expect this to provide a natural 
threshold for star formation. These have been reports of X-ray 
enhancements in the galaxy cluster Al367 that are not associated 
with un1erly ing galaxies (Bechtold et al. 
1983) . Dark halos 
of - 101 M0 suffice to locally bind the hot gas and produce X-ray 
coronae otherwise 
indistinguishable from those around luminous 
-galaxies. This phenomenon would be a natural implication of our 
model. 
The preexisting baryonic cores that accrete dark halos will be 
found predominantly in the densest filaments and sheets while the 
neutrino wells 
that 
accrete baryons 
will be 
more 
widely 
distributed, since the neutrino potential wells have dissipated 
little bulk kinetic energy . It is tempting to identify the 
preexisting baryonic cores with luminous ellipticals . Lack of 
rotational support is expected in the absence of an initial dark 
halo. The dark potential wells that accrete baryons provide an 
attractive site for forming disk galaxies, rotationally supported 
bulges , and low luminosity ellipticals, as well as the dwarf 
spheroidals 
that we 
have 
emphasised here. 
There are some 
intriguing indications of such a segregation on very large scales

of 
exotic 
particles 
(massive 
neutrinos ,

retaining the pancake theory of large scale structure. Moreover, 
the observational implications are remarkable4 Stellar systems 
with mass-luminos ity ratios in excess of 103-10 are predicted by 
our model for dwarf galaxies .

MASS-TO-LIGHT RATIOS OF SPIRAL GALAXIES 
J, Patricia Vader 
Yale University 
ABSTRACT. Ratios of mass-to-infrared luminosity are presented 
for 34 spiral galaxies and compared to model predictions. 
The 
observed values exceed the theoretical values by increasingly 
larger amounts from red to blue galaxies , a behaviour similar 
to that found by Tinsley for the ratio of mass-to-blue 
luminosity. 
This result supports the hypothesis that bluer 
spiral galaxies have relatively more massive dark haloes .  
1 . 
INTRODUCTION 
By comparing the observed M/L ratios of spiral galaxies 
to those predicted by stellar popu)ation models Tinsley (1981) 
concluded that blue galaxies have a larger mass ratio of dark 
to ordinary stellar matter by a factor between two and four as 
compared to red galaxies .  Infrared magnitudes in the H-band at 
1.6 µm have been obtained for nearby spiral galaxies by 
Aaronson et al. ( 1982) . 
Since the H-band samples a stellar 
population which is different from that dominating the blue 
band , and is much less sensitive to the star formation history 
of the galaxy, it is worthwhile to investigate whether the M/LH 
ratios confirm the results inferred from the M/LB ratios . 
2. THE DATA 
In Table 1 we present data for 31 spiral galaxies from the 
samples of Faber and Gallagher (1979) and Burstein et al. 
(1982) for which H-luminosities are available (Aaronson et al. , 
1982) . To this list we have added NGC 253 ,  NGC 3992, and NGC

Pence (1981) , Gottesman and Hunter ( 1982) , and Davoust and de 
Vaucouleurs ( 1980) , respectively. 
From the data in Table 1 we 
derive (i) a color index B -H_0 5 , with BT the asymptotic blue 
magnitude and H_0 5 the infrarea magnitude within one third of 
the blue isophotal radius R25 (i . e .  at log (A/D,.,5) = -0 . 5) ;  (ii) 
a mass-to-infrared luminosity M*/LH-O 5 , with H* the mass 
measured at the Holmberg radius (or, in a few cases, R 5) and 
corrected for the contribution by neutral hydrogen , ana LH-O 5 
the luminosity corresponding to H_0 ݴ·  
These quantities are " 
plotted in Fig . 1 .  The mass-to-lignt ratio decreases with 
color index by a factor of about four over the whole color 
range.

MASS-TO-LIGHT RATIOS OF SPIRAL GALAXIES 
3. DATA ADJUSTMENTS 
3 . 1 Extrapolated infrared magnitudes 
229 
The comparison of the observed mass-to-light ratio versus 
color relation to model predictions is complicated by the fact 
that all three observational quantities involved are measured 
at different apertures .  Since the proportion of dark matter 
increases with radius in disk galaxies its effect on the 
mass-to-light ratio is most easily detected at large radii. 
In 
order to obtain a more homogeneous data set with respect to 
aperture we therefore choose to derive H-magnitudes at a larger 
aperture . To this end we use the mean curves of growth in H 
for spiral galaxies given by Aaronson, Huchra and Mould (1979) . 
These curves are roughly linear up to the outermost measured 
points around log (A/D25) = -0 . 2 .  We tentatively extrapolate 
this behaviour to estimate the H-magnitude within R25 (i.e. at 
log (A/D25) 
= O) . 
In justification of this procedure we note 
that H_0 ݳ probably does include a significant contribution 
from the" aisk (Wyse, 1982) . 
The curves of growth have slopes 
of 2 . 0 ,  2. 1 and 2 . 4  for galaxies of morphological type in the 
range 1 to 2 , 3 to 4, and 5 to 8 ,  respectively . 
The mean 
BT-H_0 5 colors of the corresponding three morphological groups 
in our" sample are 2 . 84 , 2 . 53 and 1 . 58 ,  respectively. The above 
values very closely define the following linear relation 
between the slope x of the growth curves and the color index 
(1) 
The infrared magnitude at R25 , denoted H, is obtained from eq. 
(1) and H-H_0•5 
= -0 . 5x. 
3.2 Correction for isophotal radius bias 
We consider here the effect of the rate of star formation 
on mass-to-light ratios measured within a given isophotal 
radius. 
As pointed out by Tinsley (1981) a consequence of the 
observed increase of M/LB with radius is that even if galaxies 
were identical except for the rate of star formation we would 
still measure larger M/LB values for bluer galaxies since blue 
galaxies have larger blue isophotal radii than their red 
counterparts. In the present case both the mass and the 
infrared magnitude are referred to blue isophotal radii. 
The 
correction procedure applied here for the isophotal radius bias 
is in principle the same as that followed by Tinsley (1981 ) . 
We construct a theoretical M/LB versus B-K relation using the 
theoretical colors and mass-to-light ratios obtained by Larson 
and Tinsley (1978) and Struck-Marcell and Tinsley (197ɫ6 for 
models with decreasing star formation rates and age 10 
years , 
and models with a constant star formation rate and ages less

Since no theoretical H-K colors are available 
we use the empirical result that H-K is very nearly constant and 
about equal to 0 . 20 for galaxies of all morphological types 
(Aaronson, 1979) to obtain B-H colors . 
From the resulting 
theoretical M/LB versus B-H curve we calculate for each galaxy 
the ratio F' /F, with F' = 1 . 93 the theoretical M/LB value at 
B-H = 3 . 21 which is the mean B -H color of our sample of 
galaxies , and F the theoreticaI M/LB value corresponding to the 
actual BT-H color of the galaxy . 
Following Tinsley we define 
the standard isophotal radius of a galaxy as the radius it 
would have if its color were equal to the mean value given 
above , and we calculate the ratio RH/Ţ of the standard 
Holmberg radius to its actual value according to her eq . (4) . 
The latter equation is based on an exponential surface 
brightΞ2s s  profile in B with a fixed central value of 2 1 . 65 mag 
arcsec • 
Since E2e observed central values vary between 20 
and 23 mag arcsec 
(Kormendy 1977 , Boroson 1981) , a variation 
which is of the same order as the difference between the 
surface brightness levels at Ţ and R25 , a separate correction 
for the isophotal radius R25 is not justified . 
Therefore we 
simply take R25/R2, = RH/RH and hereafter drop the indices . 
Assuming flat rotation curves we obtain the mass within RH (or 
RZ5 ) from M' = M R' /R. The infrared magnitude H '  at R? 
follows from the relation H' -H_0 5 = -0. 5x (1+2log (R' /RY) , with 
x given by eq . (1) .

3 . 3  Results 
The mass-to-light ratios Mc/Lij resulting after 
extrapolation of the infrared magnitude and correction for the 
isophotal radius bias are given in Table 1 and plotted as a 
function of BT-H' in Fig. 2. We note that the slope of the 
mean relation is slightly flatter in Fig. 2 than in Fig. 1 and 
that the mass-to-light ratios are systematically smaller by a 
factor of about 3 , but otherwise there is little difference 
between the two figures .  Table 1 shows that in fact the ratio 
f of M*/LH-O 5 to Mc/Lɧ increases slowly but systematically 
from 2 . 5  to 3 . 5  from tlie reddest to the bluest galaxies. The 
near constancy of f can be understood as the result of the 
combined effects of the slope of the infrared curve of growth 
being larger for bluer galaxies and the ratio of isophotal 
radii R' /R varying in the opposite sense.

4 .  COMPARISON WITH MODELS 
For each galaxy the values of both M͜/Lɩ and Br-H' are 
expected to differ but little from those corresponding to one 
given aperture close to the Holmberg radius . A comparison with 
theoretical models can now be made. The empirical 
mass-to-infrared luminosity ratio in Fig. 2 is nearly constant 
on the average except for the two bluest galaxies which have 
larger values ,  while the theoretical ratio decreases by a 
factor of 5 over the observed color range. 
The systematic 
discrepancy between empirical and theoretical M/LH values is 
remarkably similar to that found by Tinsley (1981) in the case 
of M/LB (adjusting the data to the same distance scale and 
taking into account a difference of a factor 0. 7 between the 
M/LB values at a given color in the models of Larson and 
Tinsley (1978) used here and in those of Tinsley (1981) ) .  The 
fact that a comparison of observed mass-to-light ratios with 
model predictions yields very similar results in the blue and 
in the infrared indicates that the observations are little 
affected by metallicity for the sample of galaxies considered. 
The differentiation of galaxies with respect to the 
presence of a bar in Figs. 1 and 2 is meant to display a 
possible correlation of the bar parameter with color (Wyse, 
1981) .  Although the fraction of barred galaxies increases 
towards bluer colors, this bias is less strong here than in 
Tinsley ' s  sample due to a slightly different selection of 
galaxies .  Moreover there is no indication that M/L is 
different for barred and unbarred galaxies .  We conclude that 
the systematic discrepancy between observed and theoretical 
mass-to-light ratios in both the blue and the infrared supports 
Tinsley' s hypothesis that blue galaxies have a relatively more 
massive dark halo. 
5 .  IMPLICATIONS FOR GALAXY FORMATION 
Tinsley (1981) suggested that the ratio of mass of a dark 
component to that of ordinary stars is fundamental to the 
origin of the Hubble sequence of spiral galaxies .  Tully, Mould 
and Aaronson (1982) , on the other hand, claim that the Hubble 
sequence of spirals is uniquely determined by total mass on the 
basis of both the infrared color-magnitude correlation, 
discovered independently by them and by Wyse (1982) , and the 
correlation between B-H color and HI line profile width. The 
fact that total mass seems to uniquely determine the color of a 
spiral galaxy, apparently independently of Hubble type , is 
interpreted by Tully et al. as due to a systematic decrease of 
the star formation time scale with total mass of the galaxy. 
The relative importance of the two parameters , mass fraction of 
dark matter and total mass , is unclear. The fact that the 

MASS-TO-LIGHT RATIOS OF SPIRAL GALAXIES 
235 
observed range of only a factor of 5 in the mass ratio of dark 
to stellar matter is an order of magnitude smaller than the 
range in total mass of spiral galaxies does not necessarily 
imply that the former quantity is a relatively unimportant 
parameter because both quantities are measured on a linear 
scale determined by the luminous mass .  I f  dark haloes are 
effectively the dominant mass component both quantities should 
be determined within a radius characteristic of the dark rather 
than the luminous matter. This might result in a stronger 
dependence of the ratio of dark to luminous matter on color. 
Both views given above with respect to the origin of the 
Hubble sequence can be accounted for in a single picture if we 
tentatively identify the mass of the dark halo as the dominant 
parameter in the following way. Given that dark haloes form 
first , as proposed by White and Rees (1979) , the correlation of 
both the luminous mass and the ratio of dark to luminous matter 
with color can be explained if the mass of gas trapped in the 
potential well of the dark halo increases as the mass of the 
dark halo to a power x larger than 1 (possibly as the result of 
gravitational accretion of gas by the dark mass) . For MHl

with M., the luminous mass, assumed to be equal to the initial 
mass ot gas .  Massive dark haloes tend to tidally inhibit star 
formation, and thus act against bulge formation and give rise 
to a relatively young stellar population. According to this 
picture prominent dark haloes , in the sense of a large :1t/ɦ, 
are responsible for both the morphological structure (absence 
of a bulge) and the blue colors of late-type galaxies.

PREGALACTIC STARS AND EARLY NUCLEOSYNTHESIS 


PREGALACTIC ACTIVITY , GALAXY FORMATION AND HIDDEN MASS 
ABSTRACT

The first bound obj ects are expected to be of sub-galactic 
scale if either (a) the early universe has isothermal fluctu­
ations or (b) it is dominated by cold non-baryonic matter . 
The 
properties of these obj ects and their implications for galaxy 
formation and clustering are briefly discussed . 
1 .  
INTRODUCTION 
Progress in understanding galax9 formation is bedevilled by 
our ignorance about the 1 06 ɣ t $ 1 0  
yrs era in our Universe ' s  
history ( corresponding to 1 0  
f z f 1 0 )  . 
There are still 
essentially no ob>ervations which can tell us directly about this 
era ( see Hogan , Kaiser and Rees 1 982 for some discussion) ; it 
therefore seems worthwhile to explore the consequences of all the 
different schemes for galaxy formation . 
In the purely adiabatic 
neutrino-dominated picture , nothing of interest happens before 
z ] 5 .  
However there are various other schemes which would 
entail pregalactic activity at z ڱ 1 0 .  
These schemes have 
important consequences for : (a) the nature of the hidden mass and 
Population III ; and (b) the possibility that galaxies and clusters 
may have evolved from fluctuations which are not primordial , but 
have been causally generated by pregalactic energy input . 
The 
work summarised here is mainly collaborative with A .  Kashl insky 
and B .  Carr ; further details can be found in three recent papers 
(Carr and Rees 1983 ab ; Kashlinsky and Rees 1983 ) .

THE SIZE OF THE FIRST OBJECTS IN A BARYON-DOMINATED UNIVERSE 
In the conventional hot big bang Universe , with adiabatic 
fluctuations , there are two import.ant mass scales . 
The first of 
these is the maximum radiation Jeans mass , MJmax ] 1 01 7  ú-2 Me 
the growth on scales larger than this is never impeded by pressure 
gradients ,  whereas perturbations on scales below MJmax do not 
grow between entering the horizon at tH and decoupling at tdec · 
The second important scale is the photon diffusion mass 
3 x 1 0 1 3  ú-5/4 Me ( Silk 1 968 ) : 
adiabatic fluctuations on scales 
below this mass will be damped out before tdec · 
This gives rise 
to the "pancake" picture ( Zeldovich 1 970) in which clusters bind 
first , with galaxies forming later via fragmentation . 
Adiabatic 
perturbations of a hot universe could yield a value of Mmin far 
below the photon diffusion mass if primordial black holes form. 
This requires either initial curvature fluctuations of amplitude 
0H f 0 . 1  on some scale (Carr 1975 ,  Nadej in et al . 1 978 ) or a 
special kind of phase transition at some epoch (Carr 1 9 7 5 , Canuto 
1 978 , Kodama et al . 1 98 1 , Hawking , Moss and Stewart 1 982 , Crawford 
and Schramm 1982-i-:-
The mass Mmin is then rather ill-determined, 
but it would usually be of order the horizon mass at the phase 
transition , corresponding to some mass in the range 1 0-5g to 1 Me · 
Although such holes are very small , they could cluster to form 
larger bound obj ects (Meszaros 1 9 75 ,  Carr 1 9 7 7 , Freese et al . 1 9 8 3 ) , 
thereby generating pregalactic activity indirectly .  
The situation i s  more interesting if one has isothermal 
fluctuations in a hot Universe . 
(This requires initial non­
uniformities in the photon-baryon rat L-b, or else the hypothesis 
that a nonlinear damping process or phase transition deposits 
extra entropy in a non-uniform fashion . )  
Compton drag then 
inhibits motion of baryons relative to the radiation before tdec ' 
provided that the baryons are in a form which interacts with the 
radiation . 
(Otherwise the fluctuations can begin to grow once 
the baryons dominate the density [Mȳszȴros 1974 ]  . )  
Inhomogeneities 
in the baryon-to-photon ratio are therefore preserved until tdec • 
except on scales $ 1 0  Me , where radiative diffusion may have been 
significant (Hogan 1 978) . 
Isothermal fluctuations on scales 
$ MJmax would thus retain the same amplitude at tdec as they had 
on entering the horizon . 
Therefore ,  provided the amplitude falls 
off towards large scales ,  masse1 corresponding to the matter Jeans 
mass at decoupling , MJm p 1 06ú- ,Me , should condense out before any 
larger scale does . 
However ,  the fate of isothermal fluctuations 
on scales far below MJm1 whose amplitude at tdec may be bigger , 
is less obvious . 
Such fluctuations could not begin to 1row until 
they became larger than MJ , which itself falls off as z 12 if 
matter and radiation are completely decoupled ( and more slowly 
when the residual couȵling is allowed for) at a redshift 
zJ (M} $ zdec (M/MJm) 3/ . 
If the lower-mass perturbations were 
merely "frozen in" for zd ݲ z f ZJ (M) , they might nevertheless 

PREGALACTIC ACTIVITY, GALAXY FORMATION AND HIDDEN MASS 
241 
be the first scales to bind if their ampl itude at tdec were 
large enough : a simple argument along these lines suggests that 
if o 
cr M-S at recombŦnation , then S > 2 /3 would be a sufficient 
condition if MJ 
cr z3 2 . 
However ,  there are three effects which 
render it less likely that scales < MJm develop into important 
pregalactic obj ects : 
( i )  
Possible attenuation o f  isothermal fluctuations during 
recombination 
If recombination were an instantaneous proces s ,  dynamical 
and thermal coupling between baryons and radiation would cease 
suddenly at zdec · 
The previously " frozen" modes on scales :5 MJm 
would then become oscillatory , driven by gradients in the gas 
pressure ( cr nT) ; but , so long as the amplitudes remained linear 
(cf . 
( ii )  below) , the initially overdense regions would remain on 
a lower adiabat and so would persist , in a time-averaged sense, 
despite the oscillations . 
The fractional ionization level , x

and Zeldovich 1 9 7 0 ;  Wyse 1 982 ) . 
Though this is rapid compared 
with the cosmological expansion timescale texp ( in the sense 
that I x/x i 
> 
10 teŧŨ when T ] 4000 °K) , it is not necessarily 
sudden compared with the time taken for an overdense region of 
M << MJm to expand owing to its excess internal pressure .

Furthermore ,  as the Universe continues to cool below ¬ 2000 °K, 
the ionization fraction x levels off at a value ¬ 3 x 1 0-S for

= 0 . 0 1 , when the timescale for the last 
few electrons to recombine 
( cr x- 1 ) becomes as long as the expansion 
timescal e .  
Even this small residual fraction is sufficient , 
particularly if Q is low ,  to preserve some thermal contact 
between the matter and radiation . 
Dissipative effects during recombination have two distinct 
causes : 
the non- sudden elimination of dynamical couplin g with 
the radiation , and the gradual loss of thermal contact with it .

This means that there is a range of ­ 103 in x when radiation

drag i s  not able to inhibit motions driven by gas pressure 
gradients, whereas the gas temperature is still held close to the 
radiation temperature ( in the sense that oT/T << orf p ) .  Damping 
processes - due to Compton drag or to hysteresis effects 
arising from imperfect thermal coupling of gas and radiation -
persist until x and T have fallen so low that texp < tequil << tdrag . 
The cumulative amount of suppression of fluctuations with 
M < MJm during the period of decoupling depends on the detailed 
form of x (T3 ) .  
Because recombination is more gradual ( i . e .  I x/x i 
is larger) during its later stages ,  when x approaches its frozen­
in value , the hysteresis damping associated with the gradual loss 
of thermal contact between matter and radiation is more important 
than the Compton drag . 
The net effect ( c f .  early numerical work 
by Peebles ( 1969 ) ) is that fluctuations in the mass range 1 03 - 1 06M® 
survive if nb 
= 1 ,  but not if nb << 1 .  
( i i )  
Non-l inear damping during the oscillatory period 
between zdec and ZJ (M) 
Any initial isothermal fluctuations below MJm that do 
survive damping will be transformed into sound waves , and (on 
linear theory) would thereafter oscillate until MJ falls 
suffic iently that they become gravitationally unstable . 
During 
the oscillatory stage , the adiabatic invariant is 15 2 cɢ P ,  where 
P is the period . 
If the gas temperature varies as z2 , then cs 
cr z 
and P 
cr z-2 , so the amplitude 6 is constant . 
The number of 
oscillations for a mode of mass-scale M is ­  (M/MJmi - 1 13 . 
Thus 
we have an upper limit 6 < (M/MJm) l /3 to the amplitudes that can 
survive to the stage where these small-scale modes become gravi­
tationally unstable . 
Any initial spectrum with amplitude rising 
towards small masses wil l , owinq to this effect , turn over to 
6 
cr Ml /3 for scales when non-linear attenuation has occurred . 
(iii) 
Processes after turn-around 
Even if obj ects of << 1 06 M® were the first to condense out 
after tree ( as is conceivable if the initial spectrum rises very 
steeply towards low masses) they may merely remain as bound clouds 
of neutral gas . 
When T << 104 °K, atomic cooling is negl igible , 
so the collapse will be adiabatic . 
If the collapse proceeds 

PREGALACTIC ACTIVITY, GALAXY FORMATION AND HIDDEN MASS 
without shocks occurring , a cloud ' s  temperature evolution will 
therefore retrace its T (R )  trajectory until it has contracted 
243 
to the radius at which pressure can support it ( i . e .  it will just 
return to the temperature TJ which it had when it first went above 
the Jeans mass )  . 
It will therefore still be at < 1 04 °K. 
I f  
shocks occur , then the cloud will stabilise a t  a larger radius 
and be even cooler . 
When clouds with M > MJm can heat up to 
ڢ 1 04 ° K ,  when hydrogen reionizes , and thereafter contract iso­
thermally and fragment , these lower masses may just persist as 
thermally-supported clouds . 
This conclusion would be somewhat 
modified if H2 molecules formed , since cooling could then occur 
at temperatures as low as p 1 03 °K; only clouds below X 1 04 M@ 
would then be stable against collapse and fragmentation (Hartquist 
and Cameron , 1 9 77 ) . 
Because of the three physical e ffects we have outlined above , 
the f irst bound systems are unlikely to have masses much below 
MJm ·  
This conclusion holds particularly strongly in a low .Cl. 
universe , where the hysteresis damping effect would be more 
severe . 
Peebles ( 1969 )  presents computations which include the 
effects we discuss under ( i )  and ( i i )  above for masses 1 04 -
1 06M0 , 
showing that their combined effect is to imtede the growth of 
1 04M9 perturbations relative to those of 1 0  M9 by a factor 
exceeding 50 , even for n 
= 1 .  
(We learn from the present dis­
cussion , however , that this attenuation is mainly due to the 
hysteresis effect when thermal coupling breaks down ; Compton drag 
is less severe in its effects , because it comes into play when x is 
fall ing steeply . )  
I f  some pregalactic energy input into the gas 
switched on before x had fallen below the range where decoupling 
was complete , then the damping would be still more severe . 
More­
over , masses << MJm • even if they were the first to bind , may 
merely persist as non-radiating neutral clouds . 
Thus , the impor­
tant agents of pregalactic activity in a "go!:͛ baryon-dominated 
Universe are likely to be of mass MJm á 1 0  n 2MG ; lower mass 
" seeds " or sources of energetic input would be likely only if 
they involved primordial black holes . 
3 . 
VIRIALISATION AND FRAGMENTATION : 
THE NATURE OF POPULATION 
I I I  OBJECTS 
The next important question concerns the fate of p 106M6 
clouds when they collapse and virialise : 
do they form single 
massive obj ects (VMOs ) , or do they fragment into stellar mass 
bodies? 
It is important to emphasise that the absence of heavy 
elements does not in itself preclude fragmentation into stellar 
obj ects . 
In ' opacity-limited ' schemes (Hoyle 1 9 5 3 )  where frag­
mentation continues until the optical depth through a Jeans length 
is too large to permit further isothermal collapse , general cool ing 

244 
M. J. REES 
considerations 
(Rees 1976 ) show that the final fragment mass is 
almost independent of the opacity source and is Mch 
(kT/mpc2 ) 1 /4 
(here Mch 
= 
(hc/Gmp
2 ) 3 /2Ilu is the Chandrasekhar mass ) , implying 
that the first stars coula have had low masses .  
Kashlinsky and Rees ( 1 983 ) 
further investigate the problem 
of Population I I I  star formation . 
They note that clouds of mass 
M ( ?  .MJm) may acquire prior to their collapse some angular momentum 
due to tidal interactions with their neighbours .  
Any fragment 
forming within such a rotating cloud would itsel f  have some spin 
and would therefore be able to collapse by only a limited factor 
in radius , thus leaving a large enough geometrical cross-section 
for coalescence to be important . 
Once the paternal cloud has 
collapsed below some radius the coalescence time becomes shorter 
than the free-fall time and fragmentation then becomes impossible 
during the collapse . 
At earlier stages in the collapse frag­
mentation could be inhibited by the trapped background radiation 
( it is more efficient for clouds more mas sive than MJm) .  
Also , 
any small density fluctuation in a collapsing cloud which survived 
damping during decoupl ing would lead to fragmentation only after 
the cloud has collapsed by a considerable factor in radius . 
Fragmentation is thus unl ikely until centrifugal forces halt the 
collapse and a disk forms . 
H2 molecules would cool the disk to 
1 0 3 K ;  the Jeans mass (minimum fragment ' s  mass) can then be 
s 0 . 1  MŪ . After the disc has fragmented ,  two-body interactions 
between stars ( and perhaps collective processes as wel l )  would 
redistribute angular momentum and thicken the (now stellar ) disk . 
After the system has 
' sphericalised ' escape of stars from the 
system will leave some fraction of the stars in a dense core , 
where stellar collisions will become important leading to the 
formation of supermassive objects . 
Thus we envisage that the 
evolution of the primordial clouds would lead to a formation of 
two distinct types of obj ects : 
one being a generation of low 
mass stars and another a generation of supermassive obj ects . 
The general scheme we envisage is summarised in Figure 1 .  
We emphasise , however , that the uncertainties are such that we 
cannot confidently state whether the bulk of Population I I I  
would b e  o f  low mass , o r  VMOs - either seems pos sible . 
The 
conclusions of Kashl insky and Rees ( 1 9 8 3 )  can be summarised as 
follows : 
( i )  
Most of the material in these clouds could have been 
transformed into very low mass stars - low enough to yield an 
M/L as high as is required for the hidden mass - despite the 
absence of heavy elements and the presence of background radiation 
which prevented cool ing below  1000 K.

Stages in the evolution of a bound cloud which 
condenses out soon after recombination , according to Kashl insky 
and Rees ( 1983 ) . 
The cloud is expected to have a small amount 
of spin , owing to tidal interactions with its neighbours . A 
rotating disc of H2 forms , and fragments into low mass stars . 
Dynamical evolution then causes most of these stars to evaporate 
from the original bound system ; those left in the core may 
coalesce into a VMO .

momentum and ' sphericalised ' .  Most of them would have evaporated 
from the original 106 - 1 08Mȥ units in which they formed , as a 
consequence of stellar-dynamical relaxation processe s .  
( iii) 
The relaxation process gives rise to a tightly bound 
core of stars which does not evaporate , possessing the entire 
gravitational binding energy of the original system. 
As the 
number of stars in "lthe core diminishes ,  conditions eventually 
become so extreme that physical collisions are important (even 
though the individual stars would by then have contracted onto 
the main sequence) . 
The endpoint of stellar disruption and 
coalescence in this core would be the formation of a very massive 
object (VMO) . 
( iv) 
Although the low mass stars would be the main constit­
uents of Population III , the small fraction evolving into VMOs 
could generate some pregalactic heavy elements and energy input 
into the diffuse intergalactic medium. 
Even though the original 
low mass stars would have formed at z > 1 0 0 ,  the violent VMO 
phase may occur at a more recent epoch because this happens only 
after the relaxation within the star clusters has led to a dense 
core .

INFLUENCE OF NON-BARYONIC MATTER

If S"lv > S"lb , the 
neutrinos would constitute a homogeneous background impeding the 
linear growth after decoupling of any small-scale isothermal 
fluctuations of the k ind envisaged in § 2 .

They could be smaller than galaxies for S"lv > 0 . 1  but 
they could not be smaller than 1 06M0 ( since S"lv < 1 )  even if iso­
thermal fluctuations on this scale survived radiative damping 
during decoupling . 
(Note the S > 2/3 is perhaps rather unlikely , 
since it would require curvature fluctuations rising very steeply 
towards small scales) . 

PREGALACTIC ACTIVITY, GALAXY FORMATION AND HIDDEN MASS 
On the other hand, other kinds of non-baryonic matter can 
actually promote rather than inhibit the condensation of small­
scale pregalactic obj ects . 
If the dominant contribution to Q 
comes from particles which are individually much more massive 
than neutrinos , but correspondingly less numerous , then the 
247 
damping by free-streaming (cf . eqn . 
( 4) )  is restricted to much 
smaller scales (Bond and Szalay 1 983 ; Peebles 1 982}' . 
Another 
conjectured type of non-baryonic matter, axions , would be "cold" 
and also not subj ect to free-streaming . 
These options would 
permit small-scale inhomogeneities in the non-baryonic distribution 
to persist and amplify , even if the initial conditions were purely 
adiabatic ; the baryonic component could then respond to their 
gravitational influence after tdec · 
Fluctuations in the cold non­
baryonic matter do not grow significantly between entering the 
horizon and the epoch t = teq ' corresponding to z 
= Zeq á 4 x 1 04 
when thi s  matter becomes dynamically dominant . 
If the fluctuations 
entered the horizon with amplitudes 
 M-8 , all scales below 
M8 C teql would consequantly retain this spectrum at tdec ' but with 
amplitudes enhanced by X ( Zeq/Zdec > . 
The baryons would accumulate in these gravitational potential 
fluctuations provided that gas pressure gradients do not prevent 
this . 
A sufficient condition for this accumulation to occur in 
a potential well of total mass M is that MJm (the JeȨns mass of 
the baryonic component) be less than M [ (Qb + Qv ) /Qb] 2 • 
This 
scheme would permit pregalactic systems of far below the Silk 
( 1968 )  mass to condense out even if the initial fluctuations 
were purely adiabatic . 
They would then evolve as envisaged in 
§ 3 .  
Moreover , the radiative damping processes during decoupling 
(cf . 
§ 2 )  are irrelevant , since baryonic fluctuations build up 
after tdec ' induced by the (undamped) fluctuations in the cold 
non-baryonic matter . 
If constant curvature fluctuations are present initially , 
then the post-recombination fluctuations have an almost constant 
amplitude . 
A particular model for galaxy formation based on 
this scheme is proposed in Peebles ' contribution to these pro­
ceedings . 
If however the amplitude of the initial curvature 
fluctuations increased steeply towards smaller scales , then small 
clusters of non-baryonic matter might already have virialised by 
tdec · 
If the virial velocity within such a cluster were 
ȩ 1 0  km s- 1  
( i . e .  exceeded the sound speed c8 in gas at < 1 04 °K) , then gas 
would accrete onto it even if its mass were below MJm· 
Such 
objects could serve as "seeds" (Carr and Rees 1 983b) in the same 
way as primordial black holes , but require slightly less extreme 
initial amplitudes in order to form .

FORMATION OF " SECONDARY" LARGE-SCALE FLUCTUATIONS BY 
PREGALACTIC OBJECTS 
An important aspect of pregalactic obj ects is that they 
could themselves generate large-scale density fluctuation and 
thus give rise to galaxies and clusters of galaxies indirectly . 
Several scenarios have been suggested ( see Carr and Rees 1983b) . 
One important possibility is that bound objects can produce 
energy in some way - energy which may in principle be used to 
generate large-scale peculiar velocities .  
A simple argument 
shows that the energy input required can be far less than the 
binding energy of the system which the secondary fluctuations 
eventually form. 
After decoupling , the peculiar velocities in a growing 
perturbation vary with expansion factor as R1 12 (because 8 goes 
as R ,  whereas thȪ?ɠɟferential Hubble velocity across a comoving 
sphere goes as R 
) , so the energy required to generate these 
peculiar velocities at redshift Zi is just (zB/zi ) times the 
eventual binding energy , where zB is the redshift at which the : 
perturbation stops expanding . 
Equivalently , the peculiar veloc­
ities generated at zi can be smaller than r?2 virial velocity of 
the final bound system by a factor (zB/zi ) 
. 
One consequence 
of this is that , if the specific binding energy of a virialised 
system is £ c2 , then it entered the horizon at a redshift s- 1 zB . 
If we regard this as the largest redshift when the velocity 
perturbations could have b2eȫ generated , then the specific 
energy input required is s c . 
This result assumes that the 
system entered the horizon after teq · 
Otherwise , it is optimal 
to feed the energy in just after teq (or just after decoupling 
in a hot Universe) and the energy input required is sc2 (zB/Zeql .  
As a crude illustrative example , a "galaxy" of 1 0 1 2M0 and 
velocit; disȬersion 300 km/sec (whose present binding energy 
is '" 1 0  
M0c ) could have been produced "causally" by the 
inj ection of only 1 M@c2 . 
Of course , this is unrealistic 
because we have seen that galactic mass perturbations do not 
necessarily grow uninterruptedly after entering the horizon . 
On the other hand , dissipative effects may imply that the binding 
energy of protogalaxies was smaller than that of present-da6 
galaxies . 
By the same argument , a "globular cluster" of 1 0  M6 
and velocity dispersion 1 0  km/sec could have been generated from 
an energy input of only 1 0- 12 M0c2 
Carr and Rees ( 1983b) have explored and reviewed various 
ways in which pregalactic seeds can generate fluctuations on 
galactic and cluster scales which exceed the amplitude of any 
fluctuations that might have been present initially on those 
same scales . 
The reader is referred to that paper for a full 
discussion . 

PREGALACTIC ACTIVITY, GALAXY FORMATION AND HIDDEN MASS 
249 
One interesting possibility is that an energy input comes 
from galactic explosions . 
Any star with initial mass M above 
about 10 M 
but below a critical value M ݰ 200 M 
(Bond et al 
198 3 )  shouPd end up exp͚oding . 
The explgsive en͙rgy generated 
can be expresse͘4as E Mȭ5 , where the efficiency parameter £ is 
in the range 10 
- 10 
over all mass ranges (Bookbinder et al 
1982 ) . 
Stars larger than M 
probably collapse to black holes͗ 
although it is possible thaE some of the envelope may be ejected 
even in this case due to hydrogen she͖l burning (Bond et al 198 3 )  . 
Supermassive stars in the range M > lO 
M 
could explode only if 
they had non-zero matallicity (Fricke 1 9&2 )  , but this would not 
be a characteristic of the first stars . 
As Doroshkevich et al (I 967 ) , Ostriker and Cowie ( 1980) and 
Ikeuchi (I.981) have emphasised , the energy input from exploding 
stars - or clusters of them - could induce the formation of new 
bound obj ects . 
One might envisage a shock front sweeping up 
a spi. crical shell which expands adiabatically until its cooling 
time becomes comparable to the cosmological expansion time . 
(For z>S the dominant cooling process is inverse Compton cool ing 
off the 3K background) . 
For a runaway process to be initiated , the shell must sweep 
up more than the seed ' s  initial mass ;  also , the shell must be 
able to fragment into second-generation seeds . 
One can thereby 
initiate a bootstrap process which progressively amplifies the 
fraction of the Universe in stars . 
Carr and Rees ( 1983b) discuss 
under what conditions , in terms of seed mass and redshift range , 
this type of effect might occur . 
One general point about the explosion scheme is that , though 
it may work in principle ,  it is not "efficient " in using energy 
to generate fluctuations in the sense discussed at the beginning 
of this section . 
A lot of energy is wasted in cooling . 
Moreover , 
most of the momentum goes into generating density contrasts > 1 .  
To generate fluctuations early , one needs to produce velocities 
of only V

agen 
generating the pr ULiar velocity must be much larger than the

This is not possible for blast waves , 
except at very late stages after their momentum ( and , a fortiori , 
their energy) has been reduced by the cosmological expansion ( cf 
Schwartz , Ostriker and Yahil 1975 Ȯ Ikeuchi , Tomisaka and Ostriker 
1983 ) . 
This suggests that it may be easier to generate large-scale 
fluctuations from some sort of dissociation front : we need the 

250 
M. J. REES 
"front" to change the sound speed of the gas by a small fra0tion 
of its propagation speed . 
The resulting pressure gradients then 
create peculiar velocities .  
The efficiency of converting radiation 
into kinetic energy can be high provided that cooling is not too 
serious . 
A specific mechanism highly efficient in this respect ,  
invented by Hogan ( 198 3 ) , involved dissociation of H2 , which 
releases about 6 ev per molecule . 
If the primordial hydrogen 
were largely molecular , this could be a highly efficient mechanism. 
Ionization of atomic hydrogen by UV can be equally effective if 
the UV is rsleaūId in a pulse lasting less than the recombination 
time of -10 
n 
yrs (which is itsel f much less than the Hubble 
time at early ͕pochs ) .  
When the pul se is over , the gas recombine s ,  
but remains on a higher adiabat than material that was never 
ionized . 
However , if the ionization is caused by UV from an 
obj ect at the Eddington limit , rather than by an explosion with 
L >> L dd ' then the kinetic energy generated corresponds only to 
the lu͔inous output over a recombination time . 
A related proposal 
(Hogan 1983 and these proceedings , Hogan 
and Kaiser 198 3 )  is that inhomogeneities are generated by gradients 
in radiation 
pressure arising from randomly-distributed sources . 
If the sources were sufficiently intense to ionize the primordial 
gas , t£7 resultant fluctuations could extend up to the Jeans mass 
of Ŭ10 
M 
(this being the largest scale over which a wave driven 
by radiati͓n pressure can propagate ) ,  with a natural cut-off on 
still larger scales .

wells to form stars . 
A related question concerns the rareness of the seeds : what 
is the minimum fraction f1 of the mass that has to go into them , 
if they are to initiate a chain reaction leading to the present 
large-scale structure? 
Some scenarios require that the initial 
obj ects involve only a small fraction of the ŭŮss . 
For instance , 
in the explosion scenario , we require f1 
< 10 
in order to avoid 
over-enrichment (Carr et al 198 3 ) . 
In such a context , one would 
like to have a mechanism to prevent f 1 becoming too large . 
One 
way of doing this would be to suppose that the first objects form 
from the Gaussian tail of the fluctuation distribution and reheat 
the Universe , thereby suppressing further star formation by 
increasiůŰ the ű5ans mas s .  
This results in a value for f 1 in the 
range 10 
- 10 
(Hartquist and Cameron 1977 , Carr et al 1983 ) . 
It is of course possible (cf i 3 and Kashlinsky and ReeS-1983 )  that 
only a small fraction of the initial mass goes into VMOs anyway , 
the remainder being in inert low-mass Population I I I  stars . 

PREGALACTIC ACTIVITY, GALAXY FORMATION AND HIDDEN MASS 
The possibility of generating galaxies 
via smaller pre­
galactic objects alleviates the demands made on any primordial 
251 
fluctuations in explaining the Universe ' s  present structure . It 
is however still unclear whether the apparent "voids " on very 
large scales , and the giant l inear structures ,  can be attributed 
to secondary perturbations ( see Hogan ' s  contribution to these 
proceedings) . 
A key question relevant to any interpretation of these large­
scale features is the extent to which they delineate genuine high­
amplitude density contrasts in the .matter distribution . 
In neutrino­
diminated cosmologies , it is generally expected that the neutrino 
distribution would be less clumped than the baryons . 
However one 
must ask further whet.her the galaxies are good tracers even of the 
baryons . 
It has been argued that this may not be so in the 
neutrino picture ( Zeldovich et al 1982 ) : baryons in underdense 
regions may remain in a diffuse gas . 
This same possibility may 
arise in other models . 
The energy output5 from the first galaxies 
to form,,may heat the remaining gas to >10 K, so that its Jeans 
mass becomes too high to permit further galaxies to condense 
(the energy requirements for this , < 100 ev per particle , are 
far less than would be needed to evacuate a large void) . 
Of 
great observational value would therefore be any evidence on the 
baryon density in diffuse regions , or any clues as to whether the 
velocities of galaxies in large scale filaments were close to the 
unperturbed Hubble velocities , as would be expected if the overall 
matter density were much smoother than the distribution of galaxies .

ON THE NATURE OF THE FIRST STARS 
Joseph SILK 
Institut d 'Astrophysique , 98bis , bd Arago, 75014 PARIS , 
France. 
The first stars formed from matter that was almost comple­
tely devoid of heavy elements .  The lack of significant numbers of 
old disk stars with low metallicity signifies either that the ini­
t ial mass function ( IMF) of the first disk stars was weighted 
towards massive, short-lived stars, or else that the rate of star 
formation was reduced when the metallicity was low (Audouze and 
Tinsley, 1 976) .  This problem arises because star formation is an 
ongoing process in the disk . However in the halo, which contains 
the oldest stars, gas is not retained . Consequently, any two­
component model of our galaxy is consistent with a Salpeter-like 
IMF for the halo stars (Ostriker and Thuan 1 975) , as indeed are 
the observations of metal-poor halo stars (Caloi et al . ,  1 983) .  
This means that even the f irst stars which formed out of primor­
dial gas may have had masses in the range 0 . 1 -1 00 MQ . By first 
stars , I shall mean those stars that generated the heavy elements 
seen in the most metal-deficient Population_3I stars . For most as­
pects of star formation, a metall icity < 1 0  
that of the sun is 
indistinguishable from zero metallicity΢(Silk 1 977) . 
Further information on the IMF of the first stars is obtai­
ned from studying abundances in extreme Population II stars . 
These show an enhancement in [ 0/Fe] RJ 0 . 7  dex relative to the sun, 
while [C/Fe] RJ [CNO/Fe] RJ 0 dex and is not enhanced (Sneden et al . 
1 979) .  This is suggestive of a precursor population which inclu­
ded an excess (relative to the present IMF) of massive stars . 
The enrichment of the intergalactic gas detected in rich 
galaxy clusters was also produced at an early stage of galactic 
evolution by a generation of stellar precursors to the observed 
Population II stars in cluster ellipticals .  This follows simply

from the low rates of stellar mass loss at the present epoch. 
The discovery that [0/Fe] RJ 0 . 7  <lex in the Virgo cluster gas 
(Canizares et al . 1982) while [Fe] RJ [S] RJ [Si] RJ -0. 5  dex 
(Mushotzky et al . 198 1 )  is suggestive of an origin in stars of 
mass similar to those responsible for extreme Population II 
abundances . The difference in [Fe] between the two sites in 
our halo and in the intergalactic medium where [O/Fe] is 
enhanced presumably reflects the continuous history of star 
formation in our galaxy . On the other hand, primordial enriched 
debris accumulates in the intergalactic medium where it is effec­
tively undiluted by the much reduced mass loss from the observed 
Population II stars . 
In summary, observational evidence suggests that the mass 
range of the first stars extended over 1 0-100 Me and perhaps up 
to several hundred M8, s ince only such stars are capable of 
accounting for the nucleosynthetic evidence. In addition, the 
discovery (Bessel and Norris 1 98 1 )  of a halo star with [Fe] RJ 
-4 . 5  dex indicates that the IMF of the first stars extended to 
below 1 M9• Perhaps their IMF was not too different from that of 
stars forming at the present epoch, apart from the enhanced con­
tribution by massive stars . The goal of the ensuing discussion is 
to seek a theoretical understanding of the IMF of the first stars . 
The initial conditions prior to formation of the first 
stars are reasonably unambiguous in the context of the conven­
tional hot big bang cosmology. One has an initial composition 
with helium mass fraction Y RJ 0 . 25 and heavy element fraction 
Z RJ O .  The two alternative models for the growth by gravitatio­
nal instability of primordial density fluctuations both predict 
that the first bound unit5 in ਸ਼hich star formation occurs are 
uniform clouds of mass 1 0  -10 Me. The lower value corresponds 
to the Jeans mass immediately after the decoupling of matter and 
radiation at redshift z RJ 1 000 . This scale characterizes a pri­
mordial isothermal fluctuation spectrum, in which the first non­
linear lumps form above the Jeans mass at z < 1 000, and undergo 
hierarchical clustering to eventually form galaxies at z < 1 00 
(Peebles and Dicke 1 968) . The larger mass for the initialѢclouds 
out of which galaxies may have formed is characteristic of the 
minimum fragmentation scale of massive primordial adiabatic 
fluctuations . All preexisting primordial substructure was erased 
by r'ɞiative smoothing of these fluctuations on scales below 
Ѣ 1 0  
MG prior to the decoupling epoch. Adiabatic fluctuations 
first become large and non-linear, and undergo pancake-like asym­
metric collapse at z ;:, 1 08, the pancakes being unstable to frag­
mentation on scales ;'.'., 1 0  Me (Sunyaev and Zel 'dovich 1 972) . In 
either situation, the precursor clouds where the first stars 
formed were initially uniform on stellar mass-scales . What 
process then determines the IMF of the first stars ? 

ON THE NATURE OF THE FIRST STARS 
255 
One process which has received much attention is opacity­
limi ted gravitational fragmentation. Hoyle ( 1 953) first P.ointed 
out that since the Jeans mass is proportional to T3/2p-172, it 
will continuously decrease during the early isothermal stage of 
cloud collapse, allowing fragmentation to occur. The principal 
problem is that the growth time for density fluctuations is 
Ǥ(Gp)-1 /2, while the density itself is changing on a similar 
time-scale .  Hence one does not find the exponential growth rates 
that normally apply to instabilities for density fluctuations 
of scale exceeding the Jeans length, but rather only an algebraic 
growth rate. This means that the initial fluctuations in density 
or velocity play a crucial role in determining the final fragmen­
tation scale. For a sufficiently uniform cloud, fragmentation may 
not occur at all prior to the cloud becoming opaque. In this si­
tuation, one might expect to form a supermassive object, with 
l ittle prospect of nucleosynthesis of heavy elements prior to 
catastrophic collapse. 
The following example illustrates this difficulty. In 
uniform, spherical collapse of a sufficiently cold cloud, small 
fluctuations in density grow according to 
i -1 
op/p 
= oi ( 1 - t/tff) 
, 
where 8.i_ is the initial fluctuation amplitude and ti ff 
(3TI/32Gpi) 1/2 is the initial free-fall time at density Pi · The 
density fluctuations first become large when the mean cloud 
density has increased to p ڝ oi2 Pi · Only if at this stage is 
the density high enough that any given scale is opaque has one 
some hope of forming a protostar on this scale . The minimum 
fragment mass that can form a protostar will then be given by 
the Jeans mass, which however depends on p and therefore on the 
initial fluctuation level oi · Allowance for such complications 
as finite pressure (Tohline 1 980) or aspherical collapse (Silk 
1 982) does not help avoid this conclusion. If the initial fluc­
tuations are sufficiently great (oi > 0 . 1 ) ,  there may still be 
reason to hope that the minimum Jeans mass could be indicative 
of the minimum masses of protostars . Such large fluctuations are 
likely to be present in interstellar clouds once substantial 
star formation has already occurred, since preexisting stars 
are responsible for driving sizeable inhomogeneities via the 
action of stellar winds, expansion of HII regions , and supernova 
explosions. However primordial clouds are quite another matter, 
and are uniform on stellar scales at the onset of collapse . 
The resolution of the puzzle of primordial star formation 
is attained, as I will now argue, by consideration of the thermo­
chemical stability of clouds of primordial abundance. Such clouds 
are found to be thermally unstable, with exponential growth of 

256 
J. SILK 
fluctuations over well-defined mass scales . The thermal insta­
bility is associated with the rapid formation of molecular 
hydrogen at sufficiently high density. Excitation of rotational 
and vibrational levels of H2 by collisions provides the princi­
pal cooling mechanism, and is effective between temperature X 
300 K and C ɜ000 K, abਧ1e which the Hz is destroyed. Below a den­
sity of X 1 0  atoms cm , Hz molecules form by attachment of re­
sidual electrons to H atoms , 
followed by 
H + e  -r H + y ,  
H- + H 
----7 Hz + e 
At higher densities, the 3-body process (Palla et al . 1 983) 
dominates . In the regime where the optical depth T in the H 
rotational lines is of order unity and 3-body formation of ɝz 
prevails, the molecular hydrogen fraction rises rapidly. It is 
in this regime that the thermal instability occurs . An infinite­
simal density fluctuation produces a significant increase in the 
HZ abundance, which in turn enhances the cooling. Since the 
temperature will then slightly decline, the density fluctuation 
which remains in pressure equilibrium is further enhanced . Full 
details of the linearized stability calculation are given by 
Silk ( 1 983) , where the following dispersion relation is derived 
for the growth (as exp wt) of fluctuations : 
z 
-1 
-1 
w +w[tf +0. 3t 
(5-h) )-(3/Zt tf) [ (T /T) ( 1 -h)-1-h)=O 
c 
c 
0 
Here t is the Hz cooling time-scale, tf is the Hz formation 
time-sgale, T = 
53000 K, and h is a function of optical depth 
equal to T/Z for T << 1 and unity for T >> 1 .  A large-scale 
velocity gradient model was adopted to solve the H2 line trans­
fer in the collapsing cloud. 
Now tf may be an order of magnitude less than the instan­
taneous free-fall time tff when the molecular hydrogen fraction 
is rising. Since t 
> tff ordinarily, with equality if the gra­
vitational bindingce͏ergy released from cloud collapse is avai­
lable for heating, one can readily see that the condition tf << 
tff is necessary for instability .  An additional requirement for 
instability is T 
C 1 .  These conditions effectiveɛy coy5traiਨ the 
cloud temperature T Rj 1 500 K, the density n = 1 0  -10 
cm , 
and the molecular hydrogen fraction to 1 0-1 .5 -10-3 . The maximum 
growth rate for the instability is about 20tff ' The maximum 
scale of the instability corresponds to a mass of about M h 
0. 1 M8, at a density and temperature where the Jeans masst 
X 
103 M਩h X 1 00 M8. 

ON THE NATURE OF THE FIRST STARS 
257 
This result has the following significance . Clouds of pri­
mordial composition, which cool by excitation of H2 rotational 
levels (that is to say, with [Z] ڙ -3 dex) , are thermally uns­
table and form clumps of mass < 0 . 1  M8. These clumps are not 
gravitationally bound but are 1'.n pressure equilibrium. However 
the Jeans mass when the clumps form is Ǥ 1 00 M0, and this means 
that the clumps will aggregate together via gravitational insta­
bility on this scale. As the Jeans mass decreases during the 
ensuing collapse, smaller and smaller aggregations become bound . 
A nearly flat spectrum of bound clumps is produced, extending 
from Ǥ 0 . 1  MG to ƣ 1 00 M8 . These may be identified with the 
first stars . Thus the IMF of the first stars appears to be 
enhanced in massive stars of ਪ 1 00 MG relevant . to the Saɚpetਫr 
IMF, but extends down to Ǥ 0 . 1 M0 • Moreovਬ3 this conclusion is 
exclusive to clouds with metallicity < 1 0  
that of the sun. Once 
heavy element cooling becomes importaਭt, the thermal instability 
no longer operates . Presumably star formation then operates by 
processes similar to those occurring in the present interstellar 
medium. 
The thermal instability depends on a local criterion, and 
should not be grossly modified by such effects as rotation or 
anisotropic collapse. It seems that without rather contrived 
initial conditions, supermassive objects are unlikely to be the 
first objects to condense out of pregalactic clouds . Rather, the 
first stellar objects are stars in the conventional mass range 
of 0 . 1 M0 to 1 00 MQ. This means that pregalactic and protogala­
ctic nucleosynthesis should produce abundance ratios of heavy 
elements in concordance with what is observed in old halo stars. 
The excess of primordial massive stars can result in an oxygen 
excess, and may also produce a considerable amount of helium.

ABSTRACT 
The fragmentation of a collapsing uniform protogalactic cloud of 
metal-poor gas is investigated. It is shown that thermal instability is 
able to induce the fragmentation at an early, diffuse stage of the 
cloud. The mass scales associated with this non-gravitational instabili­
ty depend on metallicity and can lead to the formation of a first 
generation of massive Pop.II stars which seems to be required by the 
observational data on halo subdwarfs. 
1 .  INTRODUCTION 
The problem of the formation of Pop.II stars (halo stars) was 
originally addressed by Hoyle (1 953) in his classic paper on hierarchi­
cal fragmentation of a protogalactic gas cloud. While that theory of 
(Pop.II) star formation is based on gravitational instability on succes­
sively smaller scales, this paper is going to investigate another possi­
bility: fragmentation driven by thermal instability. 
It is our working hypothesis that star formation in the protoga­
lactic halo first (i.e. at very low metallicities) favored the formation 
of high mass stars which would rapidly enrich the halo gas with 
heavy elements; only then (i.e. at moderately low metallicities) the 
formation of low mass halo stars could proceed. A first generation of 
h igh mass Pop.II stars (cf. Twarog &: Wheeler 1982, Chiosi &: Matteuci 
1 983) would account for the observational fact that oxygen is rela­
tively overabundant with respect to iron in metal-poor halo subdwarfs 
(Sneden et al. 1979, Clegg et al. 1 98 1). In addition, a rapid chemical

enrichment of the halo gas might explain the observation that ex­
tremely metal-poor low mass halo stars, i.e. subdwarfs with 
log(Z/Zo) 
< -3, do not seem to exist (Bond 1 981). The situation of the 
halQ subdwarfs is reminiscent of the famous G-dwarf problem in the 
galactic disk for which one way of solving it was to postulate an 
Initial Mass Function (IMF) richer in massive stars at early times in 
the disk when the metal abundance there was still low (Schmidt 
1 963). At this point, one is prompted to ask whether there is a 
theoretical process for Pop.II star formation in which the Pop.II IMF 
is metallicity-dependent. Here, we shall propose that metallicity­
affected-thermal instability could be such a process (we propose to 
call it the MATHIN-process). A related concept is the concept of 
metal-enhanced star formation (MESF) introduced by Talbot & Arnett 
( 1 973) in which it is the star formation rate rather than the Initial 
Mass Function that depends on metallicity. (The star formation is 
suggested to be higher in regions with above average metallicity due 
to the enhanced heavy element cooling of these regions.) 
Literature related to the present investigation includes Hartwick 
( 1 976) and Searle (1 977) as for chemical evolution of the halo, 
Pikelner· (1 976) and Gunn (1 980) as for the origin of globular clusters, 
and Yoshii & Sabano ( 1 981) as for thermal instability. 
2. SCENARIO 
a) Initial Conditions 
We envisage a large uniform gaseous protogalactic cloud which 
is gravitationally collapsing. We assume that the cloud contains a 
small mass fraction of heavy elements (Z ;: 1 0-5) owing to the 
nucleosynthesis of a previous pregalactic generation of Pop.III stars 
(e.g. Silk 1 983). Moreover, the cloud is assumed to be chemically 
homogeneous. The set of parameters adopted for the protogalactic 
cloud of gas is summarized in Table 1 (cf. Rees & Ostriker 1 977).

The density and the degree of ionization are roughly comparable 
to the hot component of the present interstellar medium, while the 
temperature is taken to be lower because continuous supernova heat­
ing is not considered to occur then; thus, even if the cloud had been 
at its virial temperature (3x l 05 K) in the beginning, the temperature

will relatively fast drop to -
104 K, the temperature above which the 
excitation of atomic hydrogen completely controls the cooling (the 
cooling time from 3x l 05 K to 1 04 K at n - io-2 cm-2 is - 3x l 05 yr 
including random walk of Ly a photons, i.e. much shorter than the 
free fall time which is - 3x l 08 yr). Note that by the time when 
T - 104 K most of the gas is still ionized, since ionization equili­
brium has not yet been reached (the timescale for recombination in 
the absence of sources of ionization would be -
1 07 yrs 
(T /104 K)l /2( 1 0-2 cm-3 /n) or about a tenth of the free fall time. 
However, during the contraction phase below 1 04 K the degree of 
ionization will decrease substantially. 
b) Evolution 
The evolution of the protogalactic cloud depends on whether a 
small amount of heavy elements (C, N, 0 etc.) is present or not. If 
there were no heavy elements at all, the cloud would collapse 
isothermally at T - 1 04 K until the density becomes high enough that 
a small amount of molecular hydrogen forms which can act as a 
cooling agent. In case there is a small mass fraction of heavy ele­
ments (as assumed here), it is possible to bypass the "thermal trap" 
at T - 1 04 K at an earlier stage of contraction, i.e. at a stage when 
the cloud is still large ( - 10 kpc) and diffuse ( - 1 cm-3). 
The time evolution of the cloud is governed by the coupling of 
three system parameters: density, temperature, and the degree of 
ionization. The density ls imposed at any instant by the free fall 
collapse behaviour. The density influences the temperature because it 
enters the cooling rate as well as the heating rate. The temperature 
is governed by the thermal balance between the cooling rate C and 
the heating rate H. Compressional energy input during contraction 
("pdV-work") heats the gas, while cooling of the gas is due to hydro­
gen or electron impact excitation of low lying levels in 01 and CI, 
and probably en, Sill, Fell if UV background radiation exists. Finally, 
we assume collisional ionization to be dominating. Then the degree of 
ionization 
i; is a very sensititve function of the temperature and 
independent of the density as soon as ionization equilibrium is ob­
tained. If 
I; 
> 1 0-2 electron impact excitation dominates, while for 
!; 
< 
1 0-4 hydrogen impact becomes the relevant excitation mecha-
nism (see Dalgarno & McCray 1 972). The cooling rate is linearly 
proportional to the metallicity Z, since the protogalactic cloud is 
optically thin to the radiation of the heavy elements (volume cooling, 
the 01 line with highest opacity starts to become optically thick at 
line center for the whole cloud at n 
?: 100 cm-3). Detailed investi­
gations of fine-structure transition excitations have been carried out 
by Smeding and Pottasch ( 1 979). Cooling by dust grains, if existent, 
would be irrelevant _at the low densities in which we are interested 
here (no coupling of the dust grains to the gas). Furthermore, we 
emphasize that collisional deexcitation does not quench radiative

cooling (e.g. of 01 lines) for hydrogen densities n 
:S 1 05 cm-3 around 
T - 5000 K (cross sections from Launay &: Roueff 1977), so that 
photons in higher opacity lines can penetrate the cloud by random 
walk. 
Thermal instability proceeds as follows: Gas in a density en­
hancement cools faster than its surroundings such as to restore pres­
sure equilibrium. For spherically symmetric perturbations and neglect­
ing the effects of a weak magnetic field, the pressure gradient across 
the boundary of the perturbation initiates an inward radial flow, so 
that eventually the core region of the condensation becomes dense 
(and cool) enough to be gravitationally bound and to collapse to a 
stellar object (see Stein et al. 1 972, Hunter 1 969). 
3. INVESTIGATION OF THE THERMAL INSTABILITY AND 
FRAGMENTATION 
a) Fragmentation criteria 
Two conditions must be fulfilled for thermally driven fragmentation 
to occur: 
i) 
The isobaric thermal instability criterion must be met (the 
condensation mode is due to the isobaric perturbations: see Field 
1 965). 
ii) 
The cooling time of the density fluctuation must be shorter than 
about half the free fall contraction time of the cloud as a 
whole (otherwise the fragments would not become isolated 
against the collapsing background). 
Let us investigate these two conditions in turn. Firstly, to check 
the instability criterion, we have to study the thermal properties of 
the cloud, i.e. we need the heat-loss function L, defined as energy 
losses minus energy gains per gram of material and per second. Given 
L 
= H-C, the instability criterion reads (Hunter 1970, Shchekinov 
1 978) 
( Cl L I Cl T)n - n0/T 0 ( Cl L I Cl n)T 
-
L /T 0 
< 
0 
(I) 
where n0 and T 0 are the unperturbed density and temperature at the 
onset of the thermal instability, respectively. For L 
= 0 (thermal 
equilibrium) equ. (1) becomes the criterion already derived by Field 
(1 965). Note that for a uniformly collapsing cloud starting from rest 
the motion has no effect on the stability criterion (Arny 1967).

overabundant relative to carbon from Pop.III enrichment (Ober et al. 
1 983), what has been assumed here. Thus, from equ. (3), we have to 
require H 
'.S 2C in order to meet the thermal instability criterion. 
Moreover, since

(4-b) 
we infer that a fractional (oxygen) abundance Zoxygen 
? 5x 1 0-3z0 is 
about what we need to satisy H s 2C. Indeed, Zoxygen -
5x 10-3 Z 
is consistent with the adopted initial metallicity Z -
10-3 Z0 - 1 0-<5 
(see Table 1), because metallicity is usually defined in terms of heavy 
elements other than oxygen. We conclude that thermal instability is 
possible in a metal-poor (Z > 10-5), diffuse (n -
1 cm-3), neutral 
(T - 5aaa K) protogalactic hydrogen cloud. Since oxygen is a major 
cooling agent young galaxies should be powerful OI emitters. 
The next question is: will fragmentation actually take place? As 
indicated by the second condition above, this question can be an­
swered by comparing the fragment cooling timescale with the overall 
collapse timescale for the protogalactic cloud. Taking Z 
= 5x l Q-3 Z0, 
we find that the cooling timescale (tcool 
= nkT/C -
n-1) becomes 
shorter than half the free fall time 
tu 
= 1 0 1 5  (n/l cm-3)-1 /2 sec 
for 
n 
? 8 cm-3 
(5) 
largely independent of temperature, because approximately C(T) - T 
for T s 50aO K as seen from our A (T)-plot. The temperature at 
n 
-
8 cm-3 when fragmentation induced by thermal instability be­
comes first possible should be T 
- 5aOO K, for cloud cooling can 
begin only as soon as tcool 
< theat 
-
tff/2, i.e. at n 
> 
8 cm-3. So 
we expect isobaric clumping at a pressure P 
= nkT 
= 5.5x l Q- 1 2 
erg/cm3 . 
Thermal evolution of the cloud is difficult to predict without a 
detailled calculation (see e.g. Hunter 1969, Miki &. Nakano 1 975). It 
also depends very much on the assumptions made about the ionisation 
process, and the presence of external heat sources (quasars?). 
b) Mass Scales 
What is the characteristic mass scale of a condensation formed 
by thermal instability? Since the characteristic lengthscale for (isoba­
ric} thermal instability is given by 
Ath :: as tcool where as is the 
sound speed at the unperturbed temperature and tcool is the cooling 
time of the gas in the perturbation, the mass of the incipient ther­
mal condensation will be Mth 
= 
P 0 (as tcool)3, a fraction f of which 
will end up in a stellar object. Thus the mass of the first prospective 
Pop.II stars will be 
(6) 
where the index II stands for Pop.II, and f 
2 a.a 1 6  (according to 
Stein et al. 1972). Inserting numbers ( P0

l .25x 10 l l/. sec corresponding to n -
8 cm-3, 
T - 5000 K, and Z - 5x 10-3 Z0), 
(7) 
Note that this mass is only a very rough figure. Notice, how­
ever, that the Jeans mass for the above density and temperature by 
far exceeds the characteristic mass scale (7) derived from the ther­
mal instability picture (MJeans 
-
2x l 07 M0). Concerning the depen­
dence of the mass scale on metallicity, we find M*II 
-

density at the onset of fragmentation

Z. (The temperature at the onset of fragmentation 
should not depend on Z.) Mind that M*II 
-
Z pertains only to first­
generation Pop.II stars. 
l/.. OUTLOOK 
The whole picture of Pop.II star formation becomes very com­
plicated once the first generation of massive stars has formed. Clear­
ly the gas will become very inhomogeneous with shock dissipation 
occurring, which enhances the cooling rate locally (Rees & Ostriker 
1 977, Struck-Marcel 1 982). This effect may be more important than 
the enhancement of the cooling rate due to newly injected heavy 
elements from those stars. The heat input from supernovae may 
exceed that from the protogalaxy 's gravitational contraction and our 
thermal instablity criterion does no longer apply in this case. More­
over, in order to enrich 10 1 1  M0 to Z -
0.1 Z0 requires - 1 08 M0 
of injected metals, i.e. 
-
1 07 supernovae, each releasing -
1051 erg 
into the system, hence the total energy released amounts to -
1 058 
erg, which is about the binding energy of the SL_:5tem, if the system 
size is 5 kpc (corresponding to a mean density n 
-
8 cm-3). Given 
all these problems, there is still a long way to go until we will have 
a firm understanding of Pop.II star formation, which will eventually 
enable us to understand the origin of elliptical versus spiral galaxies.

Comparison 
of 
the 
primordial 
abundances 
of D, 
3He 4He 
and 
7Li 
(deduced 
from 
the available 
observations ) 
and 
the 
theoretical production of these elements in the framework of the 
best "cosmonical" Big Bang models reveals some discrepancies 
between these two sets of values. While the discrepancies may 
turn out to be largely due to various systematic uncertainties 
it is nevertheless important to consider the possibility of the 
nucleosynthesis of these elements in pregalactic massive stars. 
We argue that one cannot rule out a model in which D (and 7Li ) 
are produced by cosmic ray spallation reactions induced by 4He 
accelerated in the envelopes or in the winds of first generation 
(metal free and massive) 
stars on the interstellar primordial 
hydrogen atoms and where 3He and 4He are produced by similar 
stars. The cosmological consequences of such models are briefly 
outlined. 
I INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATIONS 
Most recent papers devoted to primordial nucleosynthesis 
during the Big Bang (see eg Steigman 1983 , Beaudet and Reeves 
1983) claim that there is a very striking agreement between the 
observed 
abundances 
of 
the 
light 
elements 
D, 
3He, 
4He and 
7Li 
and 
the 
values 
deduced 
from 
the 
current 
models. The 
following implications which are discussed in these papers are 
generally accepted : 
1 )  From D and 
7Li the baryonic density should be much 
lower than the critical density . If neutrinos have a mass lower 
than 50 eV the Universe should be open.

2 )  From 4He there should be a limitation on the number of 
different 
families 
of 
leptons 
(and 
neutrinos ) 
the 
hest 
determination 
seems 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
at 
most 
three 
di fferent families of leptons . In view of the recent discovery 
of the tau lepton, this consequently means that we have now 
discovered all types of existing leptons . 
By 
contrast ,  
in 
a 
few 
papers 
( Stecker 
1 980 , 
Rana 
1 982 , Gautier 1983 , Audouze 1 983 , Vidal-Madjar and Gry 1983 ) 
attention is drawn on the fact that the agreement between the 
theoretical 
estimates 
and 
the 
observational 
constraints 
concerning the abondances of the light elements might not be 
finally settled . 
Vidal-Madjar 1 983 has displayed convincingly 
the fact that in the case of the existence of three different 
neutrinos one does not find a single value of the parameter Tl 
( the ratio between the 
number of baryons and 
the 
number of 
photons which 
is another way 
to 
express the 
present baryon 
density) capable to simultaneously account for the abundances of 
D, 
4He and 
7Li 
(see Gry 
et al in these proceedings for a 
more complete presentation 
of this point ) .  
This 
prompted 
us 
to 
reexamine 
di fferent 
hypotheses 
regarding 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
light 
elements .  
In 
a 
few 
contributions 
( Epstein 
1 977 
Woltjer 
1 98 1 )  
it 
has 
been 
previously 
proposed 
that might be synthetized 
by 
spallation 
processes 
during 
the 
pregalactic 
era 
while 
4He 
would 
be 
produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis . This idea encounters the 
fatal difficulty of a catastrophic overproduction of 6Li and 
7Li due to the contribution of the 4He 
+ 4He reactions . 
In 
this presentation we propose that not only D but also 3He , 
4He 
and 
7Li 
are 
produced 
during 
this 
pregalactic 
era 
by 
first 
generation 
massive 
stars . ( This 
idea 
has 
also 
been 
presented in Audouze and Silk 1 983) .

The 
briefly presented in section 
II 
INTERACTION 
BETWEEN 
PREGALACTIC 
MASSIVE 
STARS 
AND 
THE 
INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM 
The first hypothesis of the scenario presented here is to 
assume that the primordial phases of the Big Bang have been such 
that the resulting material is only made of pure hydrogen. Thi s  
could be a consequence o f  the fact that these phases have not 
been hot 
enough 
for 
nucleosynthesis 
to 
take 
place 
or 
that 
neutrons were already absent when the temperat ure was suitable 
( Tȵ 1 o9 K) for the occurence of these processes . 
In order to 
account 
for the early production of 4He we make the seconci 
assumption about the formation of a first generation of very 

POSSIBLE SYNTHESIS OF DEUTERIUM AND LITHIUM 
269 
massive stars 
as suggested by Silk (these proceedings ) .  When 
they form, 
these stars are made of pure H .  These stars 
are 
stable for a sufficiently long time to allow them to undergo 
nucleosynthetic processes producing He and metals in their cores 
( Ober private communication ) . It appears that stars with masses 
in the range of 1 00- 1 000 M0 produce 4He copiously during their 
evolution ( see eg Talbot and Arnett 197 1 and Bond et al 1983) . A 
third assumption supported in particular by Gasse and Paul 1 982 
and Maeder 1983 is that massive stars are important sources of 
cosmic 
rays. 
Therefore 
some 
of 
the 
He 
nuclei 
which 
are 
synthesized inside the massive stars and which will eventuallly 
contaminate the primitive H gas are accelerated and can induce 
spallation reactions on the interstellar H nuclei . In this way 
one would avoid the overproduction of Li by He 
+ He spallation 
reactions . 
Deuterium is produced directly through the 4He (rapid and 
stellar ) 
+ 
H 
( slow 
and 
interstellar ) 
spallation 
reactions 
leading to 3He 
+ D at low energy ( E <v25 -
50 MeV )  and to D 
+ 
nucleons 
at 
higher 
energies . 
From Meyer 
( 1 972 ) 
the overall 
spallation cross section is 
-u 50 mb . In Audouze and Silk ( 1 983) 
it 
is argued 
that 
the 
formation of D 
through 
the 
neutron 
production and absorption processes is not significant unless 
these processes take place in media dense enough 
(nH > 
1 09 
cm-3 ) 
for 
the neutron absorption to take place before their 
decay 
This would mean 
in this 
case 
that 
the 
spallation 
processes have to take place in the envelopes of these stars . 
Therefore with a D production cross section of about 50 mb , 
integrated fluxes of 1;, 
2 1 020 particles cm-2 of energy above 
25 MeV are sufficient to account for D/H :t 1 o-5 . The occurence 
of such fluxes cannot be ruled out by arguments based on energy 
requirements : we showed in Audouze and Silk ( 1 983) that if the 
time avaəlable for this spallation process to take place is 
about 10 
years (corresponding to the cosmic ray life time or 
the time scale of mixing of the stellar ej ecta ) 
the required 
energy 
density 
is -u 700 
( E/ 1 00 )  
ev 
cm-3 
i . e .  -u 1 000 
times 
larger than the present energy density in galactic cosmic ravs . 
This prescription is not unreasonable in a pregalactic phase 
since quasars which are associated with this phase an known to 
have luminosities at least 1 04 times larger than that of our 
Galaxy . 
One should stress that the acceleration of He rich galactic 
cosmic rays originating from massive stars should take place 
long 
before 
a 
significant 
contamination 
occurs 
of 
the 
interstellar medium with He. Moreover in order to avoid any 
overproduction of Li these massive stars cannot release material 
in which Z/Y would be higher than 1 0-3 .

J. AUDOUZE AND J. SILK 
III CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS 
We acknowledge that in order to explain D ,  4He and 7Li· 
production in pregalactic phases we have proposed a somewhat 
contrived model : 
these massive pure hydrogen stars must last 
sufficiently long to accelerate He rich cosmic rays before the 
phases 
where 
they 
contaminate 
the 
interstellar 
medium 
into 
helium . Quantitative models have to be performed to follow the 
evolution of such stars and verify 
that 
in the accelerated 
material the (Z/Y ͎ 1 0-3 ) condition is effectively fulfilled . 
According to an interesting alternative scheme (D . D .  Clayton , 
private communication ) , during the early pregalactic phases the 
accelerated 
particles may 
originate 
from 
the 
pure hydrogen 
interstellar medium and bombard the ambient helium rich material 
still embedded in and ejected by stars . 
In either situation , 
quantitative work remains to performed in order to 
put these 
ideas on firmer ground . 
If our models survive all objections 
they would have the dramatic implication that one could abandon 
the somewhat classical and universally accepted view of a very 
hot Big Bang. Such heresies have of course to be investigated 
with great caution but given the consequences of the current 
models of primordial nucleosynthesis, very alternative scenarios 
should be analyzed to see if they are viable .

ABSTRACT : 
Even if the mean baryon-to-baryon ratio in the early 
universe were high (corresponding to., Ub in the range 0 . 1  - 1 ) , 
D and Li could still be produced pregalactically . 
There may have 
been large-amplitude initial isothermal fluctuations ,  the 
material in the high density regions now being incorporated in 
Population III obj ects . 
Alternatively , spallation and neutron 
captive processes in material at kinetic temperatures 1 0  - 1 00 Mev 
around black holes could, if some of the material was subsequently 
ejected, produce D ,  and produce (or even overproduce )  7Li .

INTRODUCTION 
Primordial nucleosynthesis in the standard hot big bang 
yields gratifying agreement with the observed abundances of light 
elements , provided that the baryon density- is fairly low , with 
Qbh2 
 0 . 025 (h being Hubble ' s  constant in units of 1 00 km s-1 
Mpc-1 ) .  The dynamically inferred hidden mass in clusters and 
groups contributes n އ 0 . 1  - marginally consistent with the 
orthodox nucleosynthetic inference if h 
 0 . 5 ,  but apparently 
requiring some non-baryonic matter if h 
 1 .  
Advocates of 
inflationary cosmology favour n 
 1 
(which is compatible with the 
dynamical evidence if the hidden mass is less clumped than the 
galaxies even on scales as large as 1 0  h-l Mpc ) , and this further 
fuels support for the idea that the hidden mass in non-baryonic . 
In this brief contribution , I suggest that the case for non­
baryonic matter is not quite so clear-cut , because if one indeed 
hypothesises a large amount of dark baryonic matter , one has (to 
be self-consistent) to explore other new effects that could

M. J. REES 
influence the abundance of light elements . 
If the hidden mass 
is baryonic , it must now be in Population III obj ects or their 
remnants (contributing a high M/L) . 
In a baryon-dominated hot big 
bang universe ,  large amplitude inhomogeneities in the baryon­
photon ratio are prerequisites for the formation of Population 
III ; and nuclear processes involving black hole remnants at 
z ݮ 100 may complicate the picture further . 
In what follows , I shall neglect possible thermonuclear 
effects due to Population III obj ects (cf . Arnett , Bond and Carr 
1983 ) ; I shall also ignore more radical ideas involving cold big 
bangs and non-primordial helium (see , for instance , the contri­
bution by Audouze and Silk to these proceedings) . 
Two separate 
effects are nevertheless relevant to D and 7Li production . 
(a) 
Pregalactic Population III objects can form in a baryon­
dominated universe only if isothermal fluctuations of sub-
stantial amplitude are present before recombination . 
If the 
photon-baryon ratio at nucleosynthesis varies from place to place , 
so also will the primordial yield of light elements . 
In inter­
preting the measured abundances of these elements , we must note 
that the observed baryons ( i . e .  those not incorporated in 
Population I I I )  are not a " fair sample" , having come preferentially 
from underdense regions . 
(b) 
Population III may consist of very massive stars that evolve 
into black hole remnants . 
These remnants will accrete intergal­
actic gas (especially at earlier epochs when the gas is denser ) . 
Some of this gas may be ejected again , after having been 
"processed" through an environment near the hole where ions 
attain thermal kinetic energies of 10 - 100 Mev, and where 
spallation can occur . 
The present light element abundances may 
be modified as a consequence of this . 
2 . 
LARGE AMPLITUDE ISOTHERMAL FLUCTUATIONS 
If the scales of structure now observed have formed hier­
archically via gravitational clustering of smaller units since 
the recombination time tree ' then the masses of these units would 
have to be in the range 10b - 1 08 M0 (the precise value depending 
on the fluctuation spectrum) . 
In a baryon-dominated universe, 
this scenario requires isothermal fluctuations frozen in before 
recombination . 
Moreover , the amplitude must be ¬ 1 on the 
relevant scales ; the population III systems would then form from 
overdense regions .  
In consequence , the gas that escapes incor­
poration into population III objects and remains available for 
condensation into luminous matter would come selectively from 
underdense regions . 
The yields from primordial nucleosynthesis 
depend on the local value of the photon-baryon ratio . 
Therefore, 

DEUTERIUM AND LITHIUM FROM POPULATION III REMNANTS 
the material available for present-epoch observations could 
have D ,  He and Li abundances characteristic of low nb/ny , even 
if <nb/ny) were high enough to contribute nb 
= 
1 .  
273 
Large amplitude isothermal fluctuations have been discussed 
by Hogan ( 1 978 ) . 
If we define 8 
= 
(nb - nb) /nb , then a region 
with 8 > 1 can still be treated as a small-amplitude perturbation 
8f the cosmological model - in the sense of being a small per­
turbation of the metric - provided that , when the background 
temperature is T ,

m

_p
_ ( 9,/9.,H) 2 
kT 
<< 1 ,  
( 1 )  
9., being the lengthscale of the perturbation and 9.,H the horizon 
scale . 
Perturbations with 8 as large as 1 0  -
100 satisfy this 
requirement right back to the nucleosynthesis stage even on mass 
scales as large as 1 06 MȰ . 
Isothermal perturbations of mass 
> 1 06 0-ژ M6 would condense out immediately after recombination , 
having maintained constant amplitude ( "frozen in" )  until that 
time - they would form Population III objects (either single very 
massive objects (VMos: , or clusters of low-mass stars) . 
Only the 
underdense material between such perturbations would survive to 
form the luminous content of galaxies . 
It is plainly possible to 
envisage an nb á 1 universe with isothermal perturbations such 
that ( for instance) half the volume of the universe has 
nb/ny á 3 x 1 0 -8 and half has nb/ny á 3 ݭ 1 0- 1 0 . 
If the high­
density matter were in lumps of 1 0ĕ -
1 06 M 
then only the 
e 
chemical composition of the remainder (characteristic of a low 
density universe ) might now be measurable . 
No very satisfactory model for isothermal fluctuations yet 
exists ( irregular deposition of entropy in a phase transition? 
spatial variations in the CP-violation parameter? ) ; there is 
certainly no theoretical basis for specifying the spectrum such 
fluctuations might have . 
The above example is merely illustrative 
of the principle that a high initial nb/ny or nb can be compatible 
with primordial production of D, 3He and 
7Li .  
3 .  
EFFECTS OF VMO REMNANTS 
The argument summarised in § 2 tells us that the light 
element abundances in the gas that escapes incorporation into 
Population I I I  objects may be atypical of overall abundances . 
These considerations are independent of whether the Poȱulation III 
obj ects are "Jupiters" , or collapsed remnants of VMOs . 
However ,  
i f  the hidden mass i s  in VMO remnants - black holes which perhaps 
formed as early as z > 1 00 - then subsequent accretion onto these 
obj ects may have further consequences for the light elements . 

274 
M. J. REES 
Accretion by pregalactic collapsed obj ects was considered 
in some detail by Carr ( 19 7 9 ) . 
There are uncertain complicatioqs 
connected with the motions of the obj ects through the gas , and the 
way the accretion-powered heating of the gas modifies the 
accretion rate . 
But a rough estimate can be made by supposini 
0 
that the accretion takes place from a homogeneous gas at ­ 1 0  
K ,

In this expression , M is parameterised in terms of Merit = 
( 2 )  
4ŲGMh ll\>/c0T , this being the rate that would yield a luminosity 
LEdd x (efficiency) . 
Motions at 
> 
10 km s- 1 would reduce M 
below ( 2 )  ; on the other hand , if the gas were clumped M could be 
higher . 
Another relevant quantity is the fraction ɘ o f  the gas that 
cųn be processed onto the hŴles
_
in the cosmological expansion 
timescale ŵ 10 1 0  h- 1 ( 1  + z) ڗ S1 1 yrs .  
If there are enough holes 
to contribute S1 á 1 ,  then 
( 3 )  
We thus see that for VMO remnants in the plausible mass 
range 1 03 -
106 MG , 
Ŷ 
can be of order unity if the accretion 
starts as early as z ] 100 . 
What , then , could be the consequences 
for light element abundances at the present epoch? 
Material falling towards a hole generally has too much ang­
ular momentum to permit radial infall :  
it will instead spiral 
inwards on a timescale controlled by viscosity . 
When M is well 
below Merit ( as is likely in the present context , 0 from (2 ) ) ,  the 
inward drift timescale - though longer than for radial free fall -
may still be shorter than the electron-ion coupling time . 
When 
this is the case , the ions are unable to cool , because their 
energy cannot be drained away ( and then radiated) by the electrons . 
The inflowing material will then form a thick torus , supported by 
the pressure of the ions ; the ions have thermal kinetic energies 
of order the gravitational binding energy mpc2 ( r/r8 ) - 1 , where rg 
is the gravitational radius , and reach 
> 1 00 Mev near the hole . 
The physics of " ion- supported tori" is discussed in some detail 
by Rees et al . 
( 1 982) . 
The inward drift timescale for a thick 
torus ca-n:-be-written a- 1 x tfree fall ' where a is the usual 
viscosity parameter , and the condition for the ions to remain at 
the virial temperature of 10 -
100 Mev is 

DEUTERIUM AND LITHIUM FROM POPULATION III REMNANTS 
275 
< 50 o(2 
(4 ) 
This i s  equivalent to the requirement that , while stored in the 
torus , a typical ion moving with thermal velocity ( 0 . 1  - 0 . 3 ) c  
cannot pass through more than Ï 1 0  gm cm-2 . 
(The cross-section 
for Coulomb energy exchange with Ï 10 Mev 
electrons being Ï 0 . 1  
barns at these energies) . 
Around a black hole , there will there­
fore be a torus of very hot gravitationally-confined plasma . 
The particle densities would be Ï 1 01 8 (Mh/M6l -1 (M/Mcritl -1 
( r/rg ) -3/2a-1 cm-3 - quite low, particularly for large Mh · 
(The 
torus is of course not in LTE - it is generally optically thin -
the y-ray density being well below that of the particles . )  
Spallation and neutron production can obviously occur under 
these conditions .  
But these processes would be completely irrel­
evant to present-day observations (except for a possible y -ray 
background) if all the material falling into the deep gravitational 
potential well were swallowed by the hole . 
There are , however , 
two reasons why there is a real likelihood that some of the 
material can be re-expelled : 
( i )  Accretion flows such as those satisfying ( 4 )  where 
radiative losses are inefficient , maintain an enthalpy close to 
the gravitational binding energy . 
Consequently , the internal 
energy (or P/Ȳ )  of a fluid element need be enhanced only by a 
small fraction in order for the element to be able to escape . 
In a somewhat different context , Shakura and Sunyaev ( 19 7 3 )  pro­
posed a flow pattern in which material spirals inward at equatorial 
latitudes , but outwards in a cone around the rotation axis . 
(ii) - Another possibility is that a fraction of the material 
gets heated (e . g .  by power extracted electromagnetically from 
the hole) and squirts out in j ets . 
The flow patterns near black holes are very poorly under­
stood . 
We cannot reliably estimate what fraction of the material 
is expelled, nor how close it gets to the hole before its inward 
•motion is reversed . 
The viscosity parameter a is very uncertain 
- its value is important because the density and the residence 
time of material both scale as a-1 , so the "grammage" experienced 
by each ion , for a given M, scales as a-2 (cf . 
( 4 ) ) .  
Let us therefore consider in general terms the nuclear 
processes that could occur in the volume within Ï 1 00 gravitational 
·radii of a hole, where ion kinetic temperatures would be ¬ 10 Mev, 
and their possible implications for light element abundances . 

276

The path length experienced by a typical ion is ږ  0 . 2 a 
(M/Mcritl gm cm-2 
Hence ( 4 )  implies an upper limit g s 10 gm cm-2 
Since the spallation reactions have cross-sections of up to 
 100 mb ,  the fraction of 4He in the torus which is spalled could 
be almost of order unity - this fraction would of course be 
proportional to a-2 (M/Mcritl . 
Free neutrons released in these 
reactions would follow individual orbits around the hole until 
they freely decayed or were captured - in contrast to the ions 
and electrons whose bulk flow is expected to be f luidlike 
(cf . Rees et al . 1 982 ) . 
The orbital period at radius r is 
 1 0-S (r/rɗ372- (Mh/M@) sec . 
Thus , a cloud of neutrons can be 
maintainedȶaround the hole , each neutron survivinf for a time 
which may exceed the inward drift timescale (   a-
tfree fall ) .  
The implications for the light elements depend on the value 
of dexp ( less than , but perhaps comparable with , :J ( eqn (3 ) ) ,  
the fraction of the intergalactic gas which is accreted into 
the potential well of a black hole and then ej ected . 
They 
depend also on the mean value of <; , the "grammage" experienced 
by an ion while in the region where its energy is ¬ 1 0  Mev . 
The 
compounded uncertainties of the Population I I I  mass spectrum and 
the physics of accretion prevent us from drawing firm quantitative 
inferences . 
However, we can state the following : 
( i )  
To produce all the observed 7Li would require only that 
3-exp 
- 1 0-6 . 
Since a vastly higher value of Jexp 
lies 
within present uncertainties , this consideration places a signi­
ficant constraint on VMOs , their redshift at formation , and 
accretion flows around their remnants .  
(ii) 
Deuterium and 3He production by black hole processes 
is further discussed by Ramadurai and Rees ( 1983 ) . 
Although , at 
z ݬ 1 00 ,  ·3ext 
could be high enough (>10-3 ) to yield all the 
observed D as spallation products , this possibility is apparently 
ruled out by the concurrent overproduction of 7Li . 
(Associated 
y-rays would then be absorbed (cf . Epstein ( 1977 ) ) and neutrinos 
would now be redshifted to s 1 Mev) . 
A more contrived scheme 
for producing D would be the following . 
Efficient spallation may 
occur in the torus , all the spalled material ( including the 
excessive 7Li , etc . )  being swallowed by the hol e .  
The free 
neutrons cloud may extend into a region (e . g .  a j et or funnel 
along the rotation axis) where directed outflow is occurring . 
This outflow would involve material that either had remained too 
cool to have 
undergone spallation or else had been completely 
broken down into protons . 
Deuterium could be formed by neutron 
capture onto outflowing protons .

New observational results lead us to reconsider current

I PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIGHT ELEMENTS ABUNDANCES 
a .  Deuterium 
The evaluations of the deuterium abundance in the nearby 
interstellar medium present a large scatter in the different 
lines 
of 
sight 
( see 
e . g .  
( 1 ) , ( 2 ) ) .  This 
scatter 
was 
first 
explained by a segregating mechanism in the interstellar clouds 
( 3 ) , an interpretat ion which favoured a quite large value for the 
actual D/H ratio : 2 . 25 10-5 . 
However the recent study of the line of sight towards 
Per 
( B0 . 5  
III ) 
( 4 )  
showed 
that 
the 
perturbation 
in 
the 
D/H 
determination could come from the star itself. The deuterium line 
profiles proved indeed to ,vary drastically in less than four 
hours ( 5) ( see Figure 1 ) .  This phenomenon can be explained by the 
presence 
of a 
transient 
component 
of high 
velocity neutral 
hydrogen, which could be due to a shell ejected by the star and 
moving away with the wind ( 6) • 
If this hypothesis is valid , the 
deuteri um lines might be blended by high velocity hydroȳen in

several of the lines of sight studied so far , thus leading to an 
overestimation of the D/H ratio. 
So 
the 
net 
result of this 
analysis is to shift downwards the previously admitted value 
Vidal-Madjar et 
al. 
( 4) 
deduced 
the new value D/H 
= 
(5 ± 3) 
1 0- 6 . 
One should note that this value is significantly lower 
than the Solar System o.pf Cl.determined from Voyager experiment on 
Jupiter ( 7 ) : D/H

The 
data are 
divided 
in 
four 
successive spectra ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 and 4 ) . One can note in the 
deuterium line the effect of an hydrogen component with 
a velocity of -80 km/ s, which disappear in the four 
hours separating spectrum 2 from spectrum 3 .  
b .  helium 
The helium abundance is derived either in hot stars or , 
with the best precision, through optical and radio recombination 
lines in galactic or extragalactic HII regions . 
In the Solar 
Neighborhood , 
this leads to the following value for the helium 
mass fraction: Y 
= 0 . 28 ±02 ( 8 ) . Since a linear relation between 
Y 
and 
the metallicity Z 
is 
expected , 
the primordial helium 
abundance Yp can be extrapolated from the value of 
Y obtained 
in HII region of different metallicities . 
The average of all 

CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF THE LIGHT ELEMENTS 
281 
results presented by different observers and reviewed by Pagel 
( 8 )  leads to Yp 
= 0 . 2 3  ± 0 . 0 1 . Very recently Kunth and Sargent 
( 9) 
derived 
the 
value Yp 
= 
0 . 245± 0 . 003 resulting 
from 
the 
analysis of a sample of 12 metal poor galaxies . 
However their 
result 
should 
rather 
be 
taken 
as 
an 
upper 
limit 
for 
the 
primordial 
helium 
abundance ,  
since 
they 
have 
not 
found any 
correlation between Y and Z value in the sample and simply take 
Yp as the average of the Y values . 
In the Solar System , 
the 
most recent determination carried out by Voyager in Jupiter and 
Saturn ( 7) provides a strict upper limit for the helium abundance 
at the birth of the Sun which is Yeȱ 0 . 24 .  
c .  Lithium 
Spite and Spite ( 1 0) have determined the lithium abundance 
at the surface of very old halo stars . By arguing that 7Li has 
not been destroyed in these metal poor stars due to the reduction 
of thA 
convective 
zone, 
they deduce a 
value 
of the 
lithium 
abunl ance as low as Li/H = 
( 1 . 2 ± 0 . 3 )  1 0- 1 0 . 
The Solar System 
value in meteorites (see e . g .  ( 1 1 ) )  is 1 0-20 times higher . This 
implies a significant enrichment in lithium during the course of 
the galactic evolution . Moreover , Ferlet and Dennefeld ( 1 0 )  have 
determined 
the 
7Li/6 Li 
isotopic ratio in one line of sight 
in the interstellar medium ( '  Oph line of sight ) .  Their result is 
7Li/ 6Li = 38 . 5 ( from 25 to 180) , which is surprisingly higher 
than the Solar System value : ( 7Li/6Li ) G = 12 . 5 .

intermediate and high mass stars and to be partly destroyed in 
the external layers of stars less massive than 2 MQ . 
-
None of 
the mechanisms of deuterium production during the . 
galactic evolution proposed so far has been proved to play a 
significant role .  So we consider here that D is never produced 
during this evolution. 
-
Both 6Li and 7Li are produced by the galactic cosmic rays 
( GCR ) . 
We 
model 
this 
source 
of 
lithium 
by 
introducinȴ 
a 
production factor in the external zones of the 
very massive 
stars (M

responsible 
for 
the

production 
are 
smaller than 
those 
producing 
6Li . 
Thus the production ratio of 7Li/6Li is

i f  there is no low energy component in the GCR ( 1 3 ) , and could 
be

to

if 
such a 
component 
does 
exist

The 
two 
possibilities are considered here . 
-An additional source of 7Li production can be found in any 
stellar 
event 
in 
which 
the

reaction 
can take place 
(novae , 
red giants )  (see e . g .  
( 1 5 )  for more 
details ) .  To account for this possibility we introduced in our 
model a production term in the external layers of low mass stars 
(M͋2M9) . 
III RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION 
In order to reproduce i) the evolution of the metallicity 
with time 
( 1 6 ) , 
and 
ii ) 
the present fractional gas density 
observed in the Solar Neighborhood , we considered models with 
infalling matter with the fol lowing parameters : 
v 
= 
0. 5 and 
o 
= 
0 . 0 1 5  which corresponds to an infall rate of 1 . 5 Me per 
1 09 years . 
a .  Primordial infall 
First we 
considered 
the 
case 
of 
infall made 
up with 
primordial matter .  The computed time variation of the isotopic 
ratio 
7Li/6Li 
is 
displayed 
in 
figure 
3 
for 
different 
assumptions concerning 
the production sites of 7L i .  Figure 4 
shows 
the 
evolution with 
time 
of 
the abundances of 
D, 4He, 
6Li and 7Li for the model including a stellar production of 
7Li . 
The primordial abundance of deuterium has been adjusted 
in order to reproduce the present value of D/H 
= 5 1 0-6 
From the analysis of these figures ,  the following points 
should be stressed : 
The 
isotopic 
ratio 
7Li/6Li 
at 
the 
Solar 
System 
birth 
cannot be reproduced in any case if no production by novae 
and/or red giants is taken into account . 
-
In the case •of a stellar 7Li production , one can reproduce 
the lithium abundances and the solar system 7Li/6Li ratio in 
both cases of presence or absence of a low energy component in 
the GCR . 
-
The stellar production rate of 7Li required in the external 
zones 
of 
stars 
with 
mass 
1 ݪ M/MeJ < 2 
is 
about 
7Li/H 
= 
1 0-8 . 
This is quite compatible with both the rate of novae 
outbursts and the enrichment in 7Li by red giants predicted by 
Scalo 
( 1 7 ) . 
Since only 7Li is 
produced primordially by the 
Big-Bang nucleosynthesis , 
the 7Li/6Li ratio decreases during 
the 
first 
2-3 
109 
years of the galactic life and increases 
afterwards 
due 
to 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
destruction 
and 

284 
C. GRY ET AL. 
production rates of 6Li and 7Li . 
Although 
the 
7Li/6Li ratio increases 
signigicantly after 
the birth of the sun , 
its highest possible present value is 
about 20 . This is still insufficient to account even for the 
lower limit quoted by Ferlet and Dennefeld ( 1 2 ) . 
-
As for 
the 
deuterium 
evolution, 
it 
is 
impossibl e , with 
an 
infal l  made up with primordial matter , to reproduce a difference 
of abundance between the birth of the solar system and the 
present time as big as the one induced by the observational 
values (a decrease by a factor 4 to 20) . Even if we suppose that 
there is no infall , and thus no supply with fresh deuterium , the 
decrease 
of D/H 
cannot 
exceed 
a 
factor 
2 
because 
of 
the 
constraints we have on the rate of astraction due to the present 
value of the interstellar gas density. In this case, in order to 
lead to a present value in agreement with the new interstellar 
resul t s ,  
the primordial value has to be 
( in mass 
( XD ) p = 
1 . 5 (D/H) p)
:
 4 1 0-6,< ( XD ) p Ȳ 4 10-5 . 
b. Infall of non-primordial composition 
One way to explain a steeper decrease of D/H in the last 
4 . 5  109 
years , 
would be to suppose that there is indeed a 
significant 
infall 
but 
made 
up 
with 
matter 
containing 
no 
deuterium at all. 
Two 
remarks 
led us to 
consider 
two 
kinds 
of exotic 
composition for the infall . 
First, 
one 
could 
assume 
that 
the 
primordial 
matter 
was 
actually pure hydrogen ,  as it has been proposed by Audouze and 
Silk ( 1 8) . We thus calculated what infall rate of pure hydrogen 
was needed to reproduce the required steep variation of D/H and 
what would be the effect on the evolution of the other species . 
In particular , 
Figure 5 displays the evolution curves in this 
model 
of D/H and of Y, 
the helium abundance 
in mass. 
D/H 
presents a satisfactory evolution but Y would undergo a dramatic 
decrease due to the 
dilution of the interstellar 
gas 
with 
helium-free material . 
-Secondly , as astrated (and thus deuterium free ) matter is 
likely to be ejected out of galaxies by supernovae and stellar 
winds ( e . g .  ( 1 9 ) ) ,  the infalling gas could be composed of such 
material . Again Figure 6 displays the results for the following 
composition 
of 
the 
infall :  
XH 
= 
0 . 76 ,  
Y=0 . 235 , 
Z =0 . 005q 
XD=O . ;  
the 
rate 
of 
infall being 
again 
8 
=0 . 0 1 5  
per 
10-
years , 
combined with an astration rate v 
=0 . 5 .  As 
far 
as 
XH , XD , Y , XLi • 
and 
Z 
are 
concerned , 
there 
is 
no 
internal 
inconsistency in the model . The required primordial deuterium 
abundance is then about (XD ) p= ( 2 ±1 ) 10-4 
-However ,  concerning the case of 3He (which is presently not 
included in our model )  a problem could arise from the fact that 
the destruction of important amount of deuterium 
during 
the 

CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF THE LIGHT ELEMENTS 
285 
course of the galactic evolution would enhance signi ficantly the 
3He abundance .

IV CONCLUSIONS AND CONSEQUENCES 
In this study we have attempted to relate guesses of the 
primordial abundances of some light elements with current models 
of galactic evolution . The main results are underlined here : 
a .  Deuterium 
I t  is 
impossible to 
match within a standard model of 
galactic evolution the abundances observed in the interstellar 
medium (now ) and inside the Solar System ( 4 .  5 109 years ago ) . 
Nevertheless 
assuming 
an 
infall 
of 
processed 
material 
(containing no deuterium) these two observed values could become 
compatible . This type of model leads to a primordial deuterium 
abundance of 10-4<xD 
< 3  1 0-4 . 
' 
P '  
b .  Helium 
In the frame of the current models of chemical evolution 
of galaxies it is impossible to account for both a low Y value 
in Jupiter YruO .  24 and a high value in the young objects of the 
Solar Neighborhood Y ru 0. 28 . An increase of 0. 04 of the helium 
mass fraction would lead to an increase of at least 0 . 01 of the 

288 
C. GRY ET AL. 
heavy element mass fraction between the birth of the Sun and 
now , which is not the case according to Twarog ( 1 6 ) . 
c .  Lithium 
Abundance and isotopic ratios could be well predicted if 
one assumes 
a 
7Li 
product ion 
by 
novae 
and/or 
red 
giants .  
However the 7Li/ 6Li rat io as observed in one line of sight 
of the interstellar medium seems incompatible by that model . It 
is interestin_g to note that an infall 
of processed material 
( enriched in ·rLi) might also solve the discrepancy. 
d .  Primordial nucleosynthesis 
We show on figure 7 the primordial abundances of the three 
l ight elements considered in this study . For the deuterium value 
we 
used 
both 
models 
including 
a 
standard 
infall 
made 
of 
primordial material (model A) and an infall of processed matter 
(model B) . 
They are 
presented together with 
the 
theoretical 
predictions 
of 
the 
standard 
Big-Bang calculations 
given by 
Schramm ( 20) as a function of 
n 
the baryons to photons ratio .  
As it can be 
seen , 
the two ranges 
for 
n 
inferred by the 
estimated 
deuterium 
(model 
B) 
and 
the 
observed 
Lithium 
abundances 
are 
quite 
compatible , 
but 
they 
do 
not 
overlap 
the 
n 
range 
inferred 
by 
the 
observed 
primordial 
helium 
fraction . This fact , underlines again that the helium case might 
not yet be perfect ly understood in the frame of the primordial 
nucleosynthesis and of the chemical evolution of the galaxies .

STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES 


STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF TRIAXIAL GALAXIES

ABSTRACT : Confocal ellipsoidal coordinates are the natural 
coordinates for the description of triaxial stellar systems . 
Their properties are discussed. An inhomogeneous triaxial mass 
model is presented with a gravitational potential that is 
separable in these coordinates . All orbits in this model have 
three explicitly known isolating integrals of motion, and they 
can be classified by analytical means . Three families of general 
orbits occur; they are identical to the major orbit families 
found by Schwarzschild to be of prime importance for the 
structure of elliptical galaxies. Some applications of this 
result are mentioned. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Models for elliptical galaxies should have at least the 
following two properties : 
I .  The density distribution must be stratified roughly on 
concentric ellipsoids. Such a triaxial mass model is the simplest 
one that is compatible with the observed brightness contours of 
ellipticals. 
2. Most individual stellar orbits in it must possess three inde­
pendent isolating integrals of motion, i . e . , two in addition to 
the classical energy integral . These integrals are required in 
order to maintain the anisotropic velocity dispersions which are 
needed to support a triaxial equilibrium shape [l-3] . 
Few realistic models exist . To date, all are numerical and 
have been constructed either by brute force N-body calculations 
[4 ' s] ' or by Schwarzschild I s  linear programming method [6 ' 7] .

No simple expressions are known for the two nonclassical integrals 
of motion enjoyed by most of the stars in these models. As a 
result, the phase space distribution function, which is a function 
of all three isolating integrals [8, T ,  is known only as a set of 
occupation numbers of individual orbits . 
Although the numerical models have considerably deepened 
our understanding of triaxial galaxies [lo] ,  still many questions 
regarding the structure and evolution of these systems remain. 
One would, e.g. , like to know what the nonclassical integrals of 
motion are. It is a1so not yet known whether triaxial equilibrium 
shapes can exist for all values of the axial ratios, and if so1 
how their properties depend on these ratios. In order to answer 
such questions it would clearly be helpful to have analytic 
models that are easy to use and are realistic in the above sense , 
or close to it. 
Recently it has become clear that indeed such models exist 
[I Q .  There are triaxial mass models in which all stellar orbits 
have three exact isolating integrals which are explicitly known. 
Motion in these models is tractable by analytic means. Moreover, 
the orbits in them can be divided in three families; these are 
just the three major orbit families that ̓ on the basis of the 
numerical models < are thought to be important for the equili­
brium structure of elliptical galaxies. 
The existence of these mass models is based on the existence 
of potentials that admit three exact isolating integrals. These 
are the special potentials for which the ਣuations of motion are 
separable. They have a long histo͊ _[1 2- l SJ , were first introduced 
in stellar ɔnamics by Eddington L_l ɕ, and later repeatedly 
classified LI 7- I T . The most general of these potentials are the 
ones for which the equations of motion separate in confocal 
ellipsoidal coordinates .  We will refer to these as Eddington 
potentials. 
The main aim of this contribution is to show that the 
confocal ellipsoidal coordinates are the natural coordinates for 
the description of triaxial elliptical galaxies, and that much 
insight can be gained in the structure and evolution of these 
systems by a study of mass models with potentials of Eddington 
form. This we do by first describing some of the properties of 
confocal coordinates in two- and three dimensions ( § II ) , and 
then ( § III) introducing a specific triaxial mass model that has 
all the nice properties mentioned in the above. Applications are 
discussed briefly in § IV.

II. CONFOCAL COORDINATES AND EDDINGTON POTENTIALS 
a. Confocal El liptic Coordinates 
Let (x,y) be Cartesian coordinates in a plane. Following the 
notation of Lynden-Bell [1 9_] , we define confocal elliptic 
coordinates (A,µ) as the roots T of 
2 
x 
T+CI. + 
2 
J_ 
T+S 
I ,  
where a and S are constants and we assume a ݩ S. The following 
inequality holds 
-S ݨ µ ,.; -a ,.; A .  
Figure I shows the coordinate lines. Curves o f  constant A are 
ellipses with the major axis in the y-direction. They all have 
identical foci at x=O, y=±/S-a. The ellipse A=-a is the segment 
( I )  
(2) 
of the y-axis between the foci. Curves of constant µ are hyper­
bolae, with the same foci. For µ=-S they coincide with the x-axis ; 
µ=-a corresponds to the parts of the y-axis outside the foci. 
Figure 1 .  Confocal e lliptic coordinates in a p lane . 
Near the origin the coordinates (A,µ) are approximately 
Cartesian. At large distances from the origin the ellipses 
become progressively rounder (A-+<x>) and the hyperbolae are nearly 
identical to their asymptotes, which are straight lines through 
the origin. Thus, very far from the origin the confocal elliptic 
coordinates behave as polar coordinates. 

296 
T. DE ZEEUW 
Through each point (x, y) there is exactly one ellipse A=cst 
and exactly one hyperbola µ= est , and these curves are perpendi­
cular to each other in this point . Thus , confocal ell iptic 
coordinates are cu2vilinear orthogonal coordinates . Accordingly, 
the lineelement ds is given by

For VE to be regular at the foci it is required that c;* and n* 
and their f irst three derivatives are equal at A=µ=-a [1 9] .  In 
practice it is therefore no loss of general ity to write 
c;* (A ) =f (A) and n* (µ )=f (µ )  so that both c;* and n* are the same

The equations of motion in an Eddington potential are 
2 
separable. For an orbit with H=E and I=i we solve (7)- (9) for pA 
and p 2 to obtain 
]J

These equations can be solved by quadratures to give the coor­
dinates A and µ as function of time for the orbit . In practical 
cases the required integrations have to be performed by numerical 
means . Fortunately, a great deal can be learned about the orbits 
without doing any integrations . 
2 
2 
Admissible motion requires that both p 
and p 
are non-
neਮative. The orbit has turning points at tBe value]Jof A for which 
pA =O and at the value of ]J for which p 2=0. Motion is therefore 
bounded by the coordinate lines . The orਯit can be thought of as 
the sum of two independent oscillations , one in A and the other 
in µ .  The frequencies of these oscillations are in general incom­
mensurable so that the orbit is a Lissaj ous figure which fills 
the area allowed by the integrals of motion E and i .  
As a result , all possible orbital shapes can be found by 
inspection of the coordinate lines (Figure I ) .  Two examples for 
bound orbits are shown in Figure 2 .  They are usually referred to 
as box- and tube-orbits (Ollongren [20] ) ,  or as butterfly- and 
loop-orbits (Binney [2 1] ) ,  respectively.

Which shapes will in fact occur in a given Eddington 
potential can be easily derived from equations ( 1 0) by solving 
p,2=Q for the given f (T) (T=A or µ) . For this purpose it turns 
out to be convenient [1 1] to rewrite ( 1 0) somewhat . Instead of 
the integral I use the integral I 1 defined by I 1=I+aH so that 
i = i + aE.

Define g(T) by

In contrast with the usual cases < like the radial equation of 
motion in a spherical potential 
< here the equation should be 
solved in two intervals separately, one for A and one for µ .  It 
follows that classification of orbital shapes can be done graphi­
cally by drawing Veff as function of T for a given value of i1 
and comparing it with the horizontal lines E=cst. This immediately 
gives the intervals in T for which T(T) is nonnegative, i . e . , 
EਤV ff (T) . Two examples are shown in Figure 3 .  A comparison with 
theecoordinate lines (Figure I )  then shows the area filled by 
the orbit . 
A useful property of an orbit is its density Porb within its 
allowed area. This is given by

Clearly, Porb can be simply evaluated upon substitution of ( J O) ; 
no (numerical) integrations are needed . 
In general ,  the fundamental orbital frequencies are incommensurable 
and p rb is the timeaveraged density of the Lissajous figure which 
fills0the whole area allowed by E and i. If the frequencies are 
commensurable for a given combination of E and i then the phase 
difference between the A- and µ- oscillation is a third indepen­
dent isolating integral of motion. The Lissajous figure now breaks 
up in a continuum of periodic orbits, parametrized by the addi­
tional integral , which together fill up the whole area allowed by 
E and i. In this case p b applies to this whole collection of 
periodic orbits.

b. Confoca l El lipsoidal Coordinates 
Much of the above generalizes straightforwardly to three 
dimensions. Let (x,y, z) be Cartesian coordinates . Confocal

The coordinate surfaces are confocal quadrics and are shown in 
Figure 4. Surfaces of constant ݢ are ellipsoids with the long 
axis in the z-direction and the short axis in the x-direction. 
Surfaces of constant µ are hyperboloids of one sheet lying around 
the x-axis. Surfaces of constant v are hyperboloids of two sheets 
around the z-axis.

Figure 4 .  Confocal e llipsoidal coordinates 
In each of the principal planes the coordinates are simply 
confocal elliptic coordinates ,  described in the previous section. 
In addition to the foci on the y-axis at ( O , ±/S-a , O) there are 
two pairs of foci on the z-axis ,  one at ( O , O , ±/y-S) and the other 
at ( O , O , ±/y-a) . 
Very close to the origin the coordinates are approximately 
Cartesian. At large distances from the centre the ellipsoids 
become progressively more nearly spherical and the hyperboloids 
are almost indistinguishable from their asymptotic surfaces which 
are planes perpendicular to the (x,y)-plane containing the z-axis 
and cones along the z-axis. Thus , at large radii the confocal 
ellipsoidal coordinates behave as ordinary spherical coordinates .

The density is stratified on similar concentric ellipsoids with

Separability for the oblate axisymrnetric case (a1 =a2>a3) was 
already known to Kuzmin [22] . One can show [23] that tfie density 
distribution (33) is the only inhomogeneous triaxial mass model 
in which the density is stratified on similar concentric ellip­
soids , and is nowhere singular, with a separable potential . 
We shall call it the perfect e l lipsoid.

The specific form of G(਱) given in (35) allows a classifica­
tion of orbits in the perfect ellipsoid in terms of the integrals 
of motion H ,  I and I by means of the method described in §II .  
A detailed anatysis i͇ given in [1 1] .  Here we summarize the main 
results . 
From symetry it follows that a star moving in a principal 
plane will remain in it, so that motion is two dimensional . 
Consider first the (x,y) -plane . In this plane the coordinates 
(\ , µ ,v) reduce to confocal elliptic coordinates ( \ ,µ) . The 
integral I3 is zero . The equations of motion (26) reduce to ( 1 3) 
with g (T)=G(T) and I2=I1 so that motion can be analysed as in 
§IIa, as expected.

The simple periodic orbits in the (x,y) -plane are drawn in 
Figure 7 .  The two axial oscillations are solutions of ( 1 3) ,  as

amplitude of the oscillation is smaller than IS-a , the distance 
to the foci . For larger energies the y-axis orbit is unstable . 
At these energies another family of stable periodic orbits exists : 
the lines \ =est are solutions of ( 1 3) .  They are stable elliptic 
closed orbits , and branch off the y-axis at the foci . In other 
words , the foci w0e the bifurcation points on the y-axis .

FiguPe 8. Classification of OPbits in the (x,y)-plane of the 
pePfect ellipsoid in terms of the integPals E and i2. 
Figure 8 illustrates the relations between the integrals E 
and i2 for the three families of simple periodic orbits just 
mentioned. These relations form the boundary of the area in the 
(E ,i2)-plane that corresponds to admissible motion in the (x,y)­
plane . Each point in the hatched area corresponds with a general 
(bound) orbit. These are divided into two families by the unstable 
y-axis orbit, one family having i2<0 , the other having i2>o .  
From Figure 3, which was drawn for the perfect ellipsoid , it 
follows that the former are buttePfly OPbits and the latter are 
loop oPbits . Representative shapes were shown in Figure 2 .  The 
x-axis orbit can be considered as the "parent" of the butterflies; 
the elliptic closed orbits are the progenitors of the loops . 
Note that butterflies always cross the y-axis between the foci 
and the loops outside the foci . 
In each of the remaining principal planes motion is comple­
tely similar. Butterfly orbits are generated by the (relative) 
long-axis orbit, which is everywhere stable. Loop orbits have as 
parent the elliptic closed orbit which branches off the (relative) 
short-axis orbit at the appropriate foci. For amplitudes larger 
than the distance to the foci the (relative) short axis orbit 
is unstable. 
In three dimensions analysis of (26) as described in §IIb 
(cf . Figure 5) yields the following result. 
There are six basic periodic orbit families . They all lie in the 
principal planes. Of the three axial oscillations the x-axis

orbit is stable for all energies . The y-axis orbit becomes 
unstable in the x-direction for amplitudes larger than the 
distance IS-a to the foci . The z-axis orbit is stable for small 
amplitudes , becomes unstable in the y-direction for amplitudes 
larger than /y-S , and unstable in the x-direction for amplitudes 
larger than /y-a (Figure 9) . 
The other three simple periodic orbit families are the elliptic 
closed orbits , one in each principal plane . Those in the (x,y) ­
and (y, z)-plane are stable; the elliptic orbit around the 
intermediate (y-) axis is unstable to perpendicular perturbations .

The three stable periodic orbit families generate three 
families of general orbits . The x-axis orbit is the parent of 
the threedimensional box orbi ts, which reduce to butterflies in 
each of the principal planes . The two closed elliptic orbits 
that are stable are the progenitors of (three dimensional) tube 
orbits , one around the long (x-) axis, the other around the 
short (z-) axi s .  
It should be remarked that the above orbit classification 
for the perfect ellipsoid is valid for all values of a1 #a2#a3 .

For a1=a2>a3 the mass model is an ob late spheroid with the 
z-axis as symmetry axis . From (36) it follows that S=a. This 
means that the coordinates (A,µ ,v) reduce to prolate spheroidal 
coordinates (A,¢ ,v) . In the equatorial plane the foci coincide 
with the origin and the coordinates are simply polar coordinates 
(R,¢) , see Figure 1 0 ;  in each plane ¢=est (meridional plane) A 
and v are confocal elliptic coordinates .

Figure 1 0 .  For S=a the confocal e lZiptic coordinates ( A, µ) 
become polar coordinates (R, ¢) . 
The function G(T) is elementary tor S=a .  The Tesulting 
ig:avitational potential is identical to the one derived by Kuzmin 
IJ2] along a different route. The integral I2 reduces to a 
classical integral of motion 
lL 2

for S = a ,  
(37) 
where Lz is the component of the angular momentum parallel to the 
symmetry axis . I3 is thƢ "tƣird inƤ2gral" [20 , 24-26] and can be 
thought of as a generalization of L , the square of the total 
angular momentum. 
The elliptic closed orbits in the (x,y) -plane that exist in 
the triaxial case now reduce to the well known circular orbits 
that exist at every radius , as can be seen from Figure 1 0 .  All 
straight lines in this plane through the origin are orbits ; they 
are unstable . The (E , i2ɓ-diagram presented in Figure 8 now is a 
diagram of E versus ƥLz 
(Figure I I ) .  The triangular area in 
Figure S2that contains the butterflies shrinks to the vertical 
l ine ƦLz =O for S=a .  No butterflies exist in the oblate model . In 
the equatorial plane there is only one family of general orbits ,  
the loops around the circular orbit .

In three dimensions we have a similar result .  The general 
orbits are all tubes around the circular orbits in the equatorial 
plane . The boxes and tubes around the long axis that exist in the 
triaxial case have disappeared . 
For a1 >a2=a3 the mass model is a prolate spheroid elongated 
in the x-direction. The coordinates (A ,µ,v) reduce to oblate 
spheroidal coordinates and again G(T) is an elementary function. 
In this case it is I3 that reduces to a classical integral 
for 13 = y ,  
(38) 
where Lx is the component of the angular momentum along the x-axis .  
I2 is the "third integral" and is a generalization of 1.2 . 
Just as in the oblate case motion is very simple . All general 
orbits belong to one family, tubes around the circular orbit that 
exists at every radius in the (y, z)-plane. Again the boxes and 
one family of tubes from the triaxial model disappear. 
Finally, for a1 =a2=a3 the mass model is a sphere . The 
coordinates (A,µ,v) become ordinary spherical coordinates 
(r,8 ,ਝ) . We find 
for a = 13 = Y .  
(39) 
From the oblate and prolate cases it follows that also Lx and L2 
are integrals . As a result we have four integrals of motion: 
E ,  Lx, Ly and L2 , as it should be. Equation (27) reduces to the 
well known one for the radial coordinate in a spherical potential . 
All general orbits are loops around the circular orbits that 
exist at every radius in every plane through the origin.

d. Comparison with the Schwarzschild Ellipsoid 
Schwarzschild [6 , 7] has constructed realistic models of 
elliptical galaxies by means of linear programming .  In the 
potential of a given mass model stellar orbits and their 
individual densities are calculated . The latter are added in such 
a way that the mass model is reproduced, with nonnegative 
occupation numbers for all orbits . 
The mass model chosen by Schwarzschild is roughly ellipsoidal , 
with axial ratios 1 :5/8 : 1 /2 (the Schwarzschild Ellipsoid [27] ) .  
The radial density profile is the modified Hubble profile which 
falls off as r-3 at large radii r, and gives a finite density in 
the centre. Schwarzschild constructed first a selfconsistent 
solution for the model in the absence of figure rotation, and 
later with rotation. 
The basic periodic orbits in the nonrotating Schwarzschild 
Ellipsoid are exactly the six that occur in the perfect ellipsoid, 
and with identical stability properties [l o , 28] .  In each principal 
plane there are two major families of orb its : butterflies and 
loops . Two representative orbits are shown in Figure 1 2 ;  they caਞ 
be compared with Figure 2 .  
Not surprisingly there are three major families o f  three dimen­
sional orbits in the model , viz . , boxes , tubes around the long 
axis and tubes around the short axis . In addition to these there 
are minor orbit families connected with higher order periodic 
orbits, and a small fraction of stochastic orbits related to 
the unstable periodic orbits ਟ9 , 30] .

It follows that the perfect e llipsoid has all orbit fami lies 
that are of major importance for the s tructure of triaxial 
e lliptical galaxies . This is the main point: it shows that 
I .  Potentials of ellipticals can be well approximated by 
Eddington potentials . 
2 .  The (A,µ,v) ' s  are the natural coordinates in which to describe 
these systems . 
IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
The construction of selfconsistent models for density 
distributions that have a gravitational potential of Eddington 
form is straightforward by means of Schwarzschild' s  linear 
programming method. The orbital densities needed for this can be 
simply evaluated from (32) , without even calculating the orbits 
themselves . Laborious numerical calculation.s are thus avoided . 
In view of the requirements for realistic models of elliptical 
galaxies mentioned in the introduction it is evident that a 
selfconsistent model based on the perfect ellipsoid will 
constitute the perfect e lliptical galaxy . 
Real ellipticals are nearly perfect (or, depending on one ' s  
point o f  view : perfect ellipticals are nearly real ! ) . Some 
imperfections are : 
I .  In many cases the ellipticity of the isophotes varies with 
radius [31 ,32] . Also changes in the position angle of the 
major axis of the isophotes occur [33] . 
2 .  The radial density profile differs from that of the perfect 
ellipsoid . 
3. Most ellipticals appear to rotate, albeit slowly, whereas 
the perfect ellipsoid does not .  However, rotation is not very 
important for the dynamics [2] . 
4 .  Not all stellar orbits in an elliptical galaxy will belong to 
the three families present in the perfect ellipsoid . As in 
Schwarzschild' s model , there will be minor families trapped 
around higher order periodic orbits , as well as a fraction of 
stochastic orbits . These orbits are unlikely to play an 
important role in the dynamics of ellipticals [lo ,30] .  
These defects detract little from the advantage of having a mass 
model with arbitrary axial ratios that has all important orbit 
families and is analytically tractable . 
The mere existence of the perfect ellipsoid makes it very 
likely that other Eddington potentials will give rise to triaxial 
mass models as well. ·These models will not be stratified exactly 
on similar concentric ellipsoids (since the perfect ellipsoid is 
the only such one) , and will have a density profile different 
from (33) . As a result, their proj ected surface density will in 
general show twisting isophotes as well as changes in "ellipticity"

which depend both on radius and on the radial densi ty profile. 
It is therefore not unlikely that separable mass models exist 
that come closer to being realistic than the perfect ellipsoid 
(cf . points I .  and 2. mentioned above) . 
The fact that potentials that are used for models of 
ellipticals are in some sense close to being separable in (A,µ ,v) ' s  
leads to the question: how close? More specifically : by choosing 
s ,  n and 8 and the positions of the foci , how well can a given 
potential be approximated by one of Eddington form? For axisym­
metric potentials this problem received some attention in the 
early sixties [34 ,35] .  The triaxial problem was recently 
studied by Lynden-Bell and the author [23] . They consider both 
the local problem of expansions of potentials around a stable point 
as well as the global problem. For the latter see also the 
contribution of Wilkinson in the present volume. 
The equations of motion in an Eddington potential can be 
solved by quadratures .  This means that one can calculate actions 
J and angles 8 (T=A,µ ,v) for each orbit by straight integration. 
TRe actions dep͆nd only on the integrals of motion so that the 
orbits can be classified in terms of them [36] . The main advantage 
of using the JT' s  is that they are adiabatic ͅnvariants . Study of 
slow evolution of elliptical galaxies (e .g. , IJ7] )  is therefore 
most easily done in terms of the variables (JT, 8T) .  
It appears that mass models with gravitational potentials 
separable in confocal ellipsoidal coordinates may be useful 
for the study of both the structure and the evolution of triaxial 
elliptical galaxies. 
It is a pleasure to thank D. Lynden-Bell for suggesting 
that "it might be interesting to look at (A ,µ,v) ' s  and Eddington 
potentials'ਢ This work has benefitted greatly from his continued 
interest and encouragement .  Comments by H.C. van de Hulst and

ARE N-BODY POTENTIALS OF EDDINGTON FORM? 
ABSTRACT 
Althea Wilkinson 
Department of Astronomy 
University of Manchester 
Manchester, England. 
Using a formalism developed by de Zeeuw and Lynden-Bel l ,  we 
are investigating whether a global fit can be made to the potential 
from the equilibrium phase of a triaxial n-body model . 
When ex­
tended from the present two-dimensional example to the fully three 
dimensional cas e ,  this will immediately yield the distribution 
function in terms of the three integrals of motion , without the 
necessity of integrating each orbit over many periods . 
1 . 1  
OBJECTIVES 
This paper pursues one of the obj ectives mentioned in the pre­
vious paper (de Zeeuw , 1983) , namely , that of investigating whether 
it is possible to make a global fit to the potential derived from 
a " realistic" triaxial n-body model with an Eddington potential . 
Phrased another way , we want to know whether such potentials are 
nearly separable in confocal ellipsoidal coordinates . 
Our reason 
for wanting to do this is that if the potentials can genuinely be 
treated in this way, it provides a simple and efficient method of 
understanding the n-body models in terms of the integrals of motion . 
The information we should like to extract from the n-body 
models begins with how the overall form is constructed from the 
individual. orbits . 
In order to do this , the orbits found in a 
particular potential must be classified, and until now this class­
ification has been achieved in two dimensions by the tedious pro­
cess of running each orbit for a long time in the fixed potential 
and examining the surface of section . 
Clearly , to investigate

three-dimens ional potentials , and potentials which are changing , 
by this method would be an unacceptably lengthy procedure . 
This 
is also only the first step ,  since once the orbits are known , we 
then wish to know what the integrals are , how we ll they are con­
served , how the distribution function as a function of the inte­
grals behaves , and the ultimate aim , how the orbits respond to 
s low changes in the potential . 
2 . 1  
GLOBAL FITTING IN CONFOCAL COORDINATES 
The form of the potential which is separab le in confocal co­
ordinates has been given many times 
(Eddington , 
19 1 6 ;  Lynden-Bell , 
196 2 ;  Lynden-Bell and de Zeeuw ,  1983) , and is

V ( ;\ , µ )  
should therefore have the form

For an ideal potential , w e  should expect X ( A i , µ )  at each value o f  
Ai , and X ( A ,  µi ) a t  each value o f  µ i to have the same functional 
form , though poss ibly to be separated from each other by constant 
amounts 
( Fig . 2 . 1) . 
For a " real" potenti al where the foci h ave 
not been 
(or cannot be g lobally) determined correctly , we should 
expect plots of the following form (Fig . 2 . 2 ) . 
Clearly we can use 
the degree to which the functions can be made s imilar as a cri­
terion for a least squares fit to the optimum foci , and this is 
what we h ave done in practi ce . 
2 . 2  
N-BODY POTENTIAL FITTING 
We have used a potential obtained from the later stages of 
one of our n-body runs on a 32 x 3 2  x 32 mesh as a convenient test 
examp le .  
This potential is only s lightly tri axial ( axial ratios 
0 . 6 : 0 . 7 : 1  approximately , rather close to those used by S chwarz­
schild ( 1979) in his initial triaxial model ) , and is not rotating . 
The radial variation is shown in Fig . 2 . 3 .  
For test purposes , we have initially considered the two­
dimensional cas e ,  taking the X-Y section 
(X > Y > Z )  in the Z 
= 0 
plane . 
The geometry of confocal e llipsoids has been discus sed in 
the previous paper 
(de Zeeuw , 19 8 3 ) , where it has been pointed out

that the foci represent the branch points where axial orbits give 
way to loop orbits . 
One way of determining the foci would be by 
an examination of the dimensions of the smallest loop orbits and 
largest y-axial orbits which are strictly in the x-y plane . 
How­
ever, this procedure does not define the foci accurately enough . 
Lynden-Bell and de Zeeuw have devised a simple analytic method 
of locating the foci . 
By differentiating the expression 
(A. -
µ) VEdd (x2 , y2 ) 
= I;* ( A. )  -
11* ( µ )  
( 2 .  4 )  
I 
for the separable Eddington potential in Cartesian coordinates with 
respect to A. ,  and equating the resulting expressions evaluated at 
the origin and the focus , they obtain 
VEdd (0 , n ) 
- VEdd (O, 0) 
avEdd (o , 0J /ax2 
( 2 . 5 )  
where n 
= S 
-
a ,  which i s  the square of the position of the focus 
along the y axis . 
Once avEdd (O, O) /ax2 
= g ,  say ,  has been deter­
mined, then the intersection of the line gy with the graph of 
VEdd (O, y2 ) 
= VEdd (O, 0) 
gives the required value of n . 
The potential is given as V (x2 , y2 ) and we require it as a 
function of ( A. ,  µ) . 
The confocal coordinates corresponding to

the Cartesian coordinates for each point at which the potential is 
tabulated are given by 
A = 1/2 
(x2 + y2 -a 
- S ) 
+ 1/2 
( (a

The potential must then be interpolated onto a uniform grid in 
( A ,  µ ) 
space . 
The outer corners of the square grid ,  for which we 
do not have complete coverage in (A , µ ) have been omitted from the 
subsequent fit . 
For the optimum foci , the sections târough the function in 
the A and µ directions are shown in Fig . 2 . 4  and 2 . 5 .

We may shift the curves by an arbitrary constant without 
alte ring the form of the function , 
and for a perfect Eddington po­
tential , this would result in all the curves being exactly super­
posed. 
Superposing the means of all the curves shown in Figs . 2 . 4  
and 2 . 5  yields Figs . 2 . 6  and 2 . 7 .

There is a slight change of form over the range of the func­
tion , but nevertheless it is clear that to first order , an 
Eddington potential represents an acceptable fit . 
It is reasonable to suppose that weighting the function ac­
cording to the particle density might also be an allowable mod­
ification , and hence in Fig . 2 . 8  and 2 . 9  we show the effect of 
weighting X ( A ,  µ) with the function 
l/ ( constant* T  + constant) 2 
where T is either A or µ over the appropriate range . 
Fig. 2 . 10 and 2 . 1 1 show that we can superpose the 
rather s atisfactorily over mos t  of the potentia l .

In the ideal case we should expect one continuous function 
of X ( T )  over the entire range , with X (A )  
= X ( T )  and x ( µ )  
= X ( T )  
in the appropriate adj acent intervals ( cf .  Fig .

For each orbit we have instantaneous values of x ,  y ,  x ,  and 
y ,  and hence the confocal equivalents ڐ and µ are given by 
2x/x 
A / ( A  + a l + µ / (µ + a l 
( 2  . 12 l  
2Y/Y 
A/ ( A  + B l  + µ / ( µ  + B l  
and equation ( 2 . l l . 
Therefore b y  simply knowing the form o f  the 
potential at any instant , and the corresponding position and 
ve locity for each orbit , we can immediately classify all the 
orbits , and represent the orbital constitution of a potential by 
a single H- I occupation diagram , whi ch is j ust a graphical rep­
resentation of the distribution function . 
In practice it is almos t impossib le to use the n-body particle 
orbits be cause none of them are strictly two-dimensional . 
We have 
therefore i llustrated the distribution functions for some families 
of representative test orbits in Figs . 
3 . 1 to 3 . 3 .  
These figures 
are to be compared with Fig . 8 of the previous paper ( de Zeeuw , 
1 984) .

This marks the point at which it is necessary to move into three 
dimensions -
the part of the work which we are j us t  about to under­
tak e .  
Here we shall have the advantage of a 64 x 64 x 64 grid and 
three-dimensional " real" orbits for about 5000 particles , hence we 
can reasonab ly hope for a good determination of the dis tribution 
function .

CONCLUSIONS 
Our first attempts at fitting an n-body potential with an 
Eddington potential look very promising , and have encouraged us 
to press on to the three dimensional cas e .  
It seems that for at 
l east some astrophys ically interesting models , the potentials are 
such that we can make use of this neat , powerful and economical 
method of extracting the information about the integrals of motion 
from the experimental orbits . 
Thi s  method is complementary to the spectral analysi s  tech­
nique b eing developed by Binney and his co-workers ( eg .  Binney and 
Spergel ,  19 83 ) . 
For potentials where it can be applied with j ust­
ification , it then involves substantial ly less computation than 
the spectral analysis method, which does require the integration 
of whole orbits . 
However ,  spectral analysis is not restricted in 

ARE N-BODY POTENTIALS OF EDDINGTON FORM? 
325 
the type of potential it can treat , and it is also being adapted 
to cope with rotating potentials . 
It therefore seems that we are very close to having the 
analytical tools to achieve our goals of following s low changes in 
the potential such as might happen during evolution of an isolated 
sys tem, or modification of a system during an encounter . 
Both 
techniques will eventually yield adiabatic invariants , and s tudy 
of these during evolution of the potentials promises to yield some 
very interes ting results .

SECULAR DYNAMICAL 
EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES

I. INTRODUCTION 
Our knowledge and understanding of the structure of normal 
galaxies is growing rapidly. An important, but less studied, 
aspect is the slow secular dynamical evolution of galaxies over a 
Hubble t ime. As shown here, important ,  observable effects occur in 
galaxy structure and morphology . It is expected that during the 
Space Telescope era this can be widely studied since galaxies at a 
redshift of approximately unity will be observed easily .  
The slow changes i n  potential are envisaged t o  occur over a large 
number of dynamical t ime scales of the system. Such changes can be 
caused by a variety of circum>tances ,  some specific examples of 
which are: cooling and accretion of gas onto massive galaxies for 
example N_Gf 1275, where the accretion which is estimated to be 
300 M yr 
(Fabian et al 1983) ; slow formation of the disks of 
spiral0galaxies which can have a marked influence on the structure 
of the bulge; the non-axisymmetric driving of radial flow velo­
cities in disks that, taken over a Hubble time, can completely 
alter the disk morphology; and the formation of a central massive 
black hole in a . triaxial core producing the normal spike in the 
stellar density and also changing the fundamental nature of the 
orbits from box to tube as the sphere of influence of the hole 
encompasses the core. 
Apart from the classical studies of the classical ellipsoids (c. f .  
Chandrasekhar 1969) , secular evolution effects have been mainly 
studied in disks. As emphasized by Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs (1971) , 
galaxies want to transfer their angular momentum outwards thereby 
increasing their binding energy . Schwarz (1981) has shown that an

ensemble of sticky clouds driven in a disk by a bar will sweep out 
the region betਲen resonances to form annular concentrations of 
gas within approximately ten dynamical times. These structures he 
associated with rings . These numerical studies are modelled analy­
tically in II. 
Bar evolution is not yet clearly understood. Lynden-Bell (1979) 
has argued, on the basis of an isochrone orbit analysis , that bars 
form in the rising position of the rotation curve and as they 
evolve and grow they become shorter and thinner. On the other 
hand, Weinberg and Tremaine (1983) show that if one models bars 
with planar Riemannian ellipsoids then, as they grow, they become 
shorter and fatter. The final non-linear state of a bar is also 
unclear from simulation work. Combes and Sanders ( 1981) performed 
a three-dimensional simulation and showed that bars dissolved at a 
sufficiently elongated axial ratio. In striking contrast ,  Sellwood 
and coworkers (Sellwood 1980, 1981) have found no such dissolution 
using long runs of their highly accurate code. The latter 
calculation is, however, only two dimensional as in the work of 
Efstathiou, Lake and Negroponte ( 1982) and it is possible that 
three dimensional effects such as the f irehose instability (Toomre 
1 966, Kulsrud, Mark and Caruso, 1972) may be important for very 
radial orbits. 
Combes and Sanders had a 30% mass loss but this probably does not 
effect their overall conclusion. In the detailed s imulation of 
collapse models , van Albada (1982) found that, in the transient 
initial phases , bars evolve from long and skinny to short and fat . 
Sanders and van Albada (1979) have shown how a bar can drive a 
significant temperature anisotropy in the disk due to preferential 
heating in the plane. Stochastic effects and related heating 
processes at resonances have been studied in detail by Sanders and 
Teuben (1983) , Contopolous (1983) and Athanassoula (1983) . The 
initial goal of such a study is to determine global properties of 
galaxies such as shape, density profile, rotation curve and radial 
velocity dispersion profile that are affected by slow changes in 
the potential in quite different ways from rapid changes and the 
associated violent relaxation processes. 
II. FORCED RADIAL FLCMS IN GALACTIC DISKS 
We study here how a population of clouds moving on ballistic 
orbits with some effective drag, due to interaction with the 
background disk, can undergo substantial radial motion in less 
than a Hubble time. Inside corotation the clouds lose angular 
momentum to a driving wave, outside corotation they gain from it. 
Consequently , in the absence of an inner Lindblad resonance, gas 
can be swept from inside corotation to the centre, or from outside 
corotation to the outer Lindblad resonance, in the recent past. 

SECULAR DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES 
3 29 
Radial gas flows in galactic disks have often been invoked to 
explain metallicity gradients and, if present, are thought to have 
s ignificant influence on many aspects of disk formation and 
evolution. Here we present a calculation of how a population of 
massive, presumably molecular clouds , undergoing some drag by 
interacting with the background disk, will evolve due to the 
presence of a driving non-axisymmetric disturbance such as a 
spiral wave or bar. Significant sweeping of the galactic disk 
inwards inside corotation and outwards outside corotation occurs 
on t ime-scales of 
-10 rotation t imes. Previous numerical s imula­
tions of the bar forcing of an ensemble of colliding clouds are in 
agreement with our result ( Schwarz ,  1981) . Obvious applications 
are to rings in SO galaxies and gas flows in their inner regions . 
However, the aim of this work is to present a detailed analytic 
calculation of the angular momentum exchange between a spiral wave 
and a 'dragged' cloud. 
Throughout the discussion we will focus on an average cloud from 
an ensemble of clouds with random positions and phases at their 
formation, destruction and injection. At cloud formation, we 
assumed the clouds are launched on ballistic, stellar, orbits with 
a epicyclic energy significantly larger than that of the gas 
(Leiesawitz and Bash, 1982) . The clouds feel a drag because of 
this difference, which we model by assuming the cloud and gas 
angular momentum is the same (so therefore are their angular velo­
city Q and mean epicyclic frequency K) , but the cloud epicyclic 
energy is damped such that the radial action J1 = t Ka2 is damped 
according to 
. Jl = y(Jl- Jl 
) = -yJl 
' if J1>> Jl 
• 
ps

ps 
In this limit we are, in effect, assuming that the background gas 
is moving on almost circular orbits and so indeed are the clouds 
if unperturbed by a wave. To zeroth order J 1 - J 1 
- 0 .  When the 
wave perturbation is present, we model the differਲ਼਴ਵe between the 
large epicycle of the ballistic clouds and the background by 
ass uming in averaging over an ensemble of clouds that liJ1 
- 0 
and only the clouds responded to the perturbation.

Clouds are formed, destroyed and relaunched on timescales shorter 
than l/y so that the above inequality holds wel l. The drag is a 
simple way of describing a very complex s ituation involving cloud­
cloud 
collisions, 
shocks and other dissipative gas 
dynamic 
effects. For example, dynamical friction estimates are given in 
Icke ( 1982) , Julian ( 1967) and Thorne (1968) and Fokker Planck 
type estimates of the drag due to collisions and coagulation are 
discussed in Norman and Silk ( 1980) . 
However, very interesting physics can result from assuming y is 
constant. We do this and leave more complex models to the future .

To first order the clouds are driven by the wave in the classical 
forced oscillator response where there is only a phase shift in 
the damped cloud response in comparison with the undamped stellar 
response. To ensure the accuracy of our calculation 
we have 
followed the direct second order computational technique of 
Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs (197 1 ) ,  with the exception that, because 
of the epicyclic damping, the first order integration of the 
radial action J1 is obtain from solving

Lenticular SO galaxies have gas rings in the outer regions and no 
gas in the interior. We suggest here that they have been swept by 
this mechanism, then Q of the disk increased and the waves turned 
off. Such SO rings should always have stars and gas moving in the 
same direction in contrast to the infalling gas rich dwarf hypo­
thesis (Si lk and Norman 1979, Van Woerden et al 1983) . Such a 
mechanism could be important in creating substantial radial inflow 
in the central parts of galaxies (Norman and Silk 1983, Lake and 
Norman 1983) . 'lle radial outflow outside corotation could produce

1979) this flattening could be observed exterior to the bar. It

Generally speaking, an unstable disk with a set of ballistic lumps 
with some background friction will show this interesting process 
of angular momentum exchange and radial flow. 
III. EVOLUTION OF SPHEROIDS 
The secular evolution of spheroids has been studied in immense 
detail by Chandrasekha r, Friedman and Lebowitz for the classical 
ellipsoids see Chandrasekhar 1969 for a review. Here we consider 
only non-classical syst ems with at least one additional quasi­
integral. Previous studies here include the analysis of the 
formation and collapse phase of the Galaxy including a third 
integral (Yoshii and Sa io 19 79) and more recently numerical work 
on spectral stellar dynamics ( Binney and Spergel 1982 , 1983) who 
analysed tube to box transitions in slowly varying triaxial 
systems. We shall discuss the above problems as well as the 
structure of galaxies that slowly became axisymmetric from an 
initially triaxial state and the evolution of a galaxy 's core 
region as a black hole is formed. 
Yoshii and Saio (1979) considered the slow collapse of the Galaxy 
using an axisymmetric potential with a third integral given by

(ELS) . For a rapid collapse the eccentricity changes considerably 
but the box angle is conserved. For a slow collapse there is 
little change of eccentricity (since it is related to the con­
served adiabatic invariants) and the box angle decreases. Their 
analysis showed that a slow collapse was possibly a better fit to 
the data than the classic ELS results. Further work is necessary 
here including the important effect of a massive dark halo. 
We now consider the evolution of a dynamicalsystem from a triaxial 
to axisymmetric structure that may for example be caused by 
massive disk formation in a bulge or by the slow adiabatic spin up 
of a triaxial system. In a non-rotating triaxial system there are 
two dominant families of tube orbit s: one around the largest axis 
(a spindle orbit called hereafter Tube 1) and the other (Tube 2) 
around the shortest axis. We shall see how Tube 1 dissolves as the 
system becomes axisymmetric and Tube 2 remains as the system 
slowly became axisymmetric. We model this evolution using a 
separable potential in spherical co-ordinates with a generic 
potential form (see Lake and Norman, 1983)

evolution E, r2 and r3 adjust to keep the area or action instant 
as the potential changes. 
From a cursury inspection of the Figure 2 we can see the effects 
of a triaxial to axisymmetric transition. Tube 1 consists of a 
circulation in 6 and a trapping in cp and as K( cp) goes to zero. r3 
is unchanged or increases only slightly and this tube disappears .  
Tube 2 is a circulation in cp with a trapping in 6 and as K( cp) goes 
to zero, this tube remains. The loss of Tube 1 but not of Tube 2 
leads to the conjecture that this will produce a peanut-shaped 
bulge (c.f. Kormendy and Illingworth 1982, Dressler and Sandage 
1983) It is interesting to note here that attempts to produce this 
effect using disk formation in a axially symmetric bulge have not 
been succesful (S .  White, private communication) . However the 
three-dimensional evolving bar s imulations of Combes an Sanders 
did produce a transient peanut-shape when viewed looking along the 
major axis of the bar. 

SECULAR DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES

The essentially graphical analysis given here is easiest to use in 
spherical coordinate but we note the following problems. Firstly ,  
there i s  the need t o  fit a separable potential which can only be 
done strictly for non-rotating systems and these peanut-shaped 
bulges do rotate. Secondly , fitting separable potentials is best 
done in general ellipsoidal co-ordinates and the graphical method 
beco11£s more complex than in the spherical case. 
Briefly turning to the growth of a central mass ive object such as 
a Schwarzschild or Kerr hole in the centre of a triaxial galaxy. 
The following questions arise. Is there a catastrophic instability 
when the sphere of influence of the hole extends past the foci of 
the triax1fl system where the orbits change from box to tube, 
i . e .  GM.,../ o 
> r 
so that the core consists of tube orbits not 
boxes? 'bo the riɐi smoothly change as one models the potential 
with a separable one as, we move outwards from the central hole. 
For example if a is a focus can one model the system using a WKBJ 
approach with a =  a tanh (r/rh) as a ' slowly ' varying focus? Can 
one produce a stelfar hydodynmaics solution to the problem using 
the perfect ellipsoid (de Zeeuw 1983) plus black hole? 
The most obviously direct way 
to investigate these secular 
evolutionary effects is to take the self-consistent, very high 
dynamic-range simulations of van Albada and coworkers and slowly 
change the potential by growing a central massive black hole, or a 
bulge and disk, or by slowly torquing a triaxial configuration 
until it becomes axisymmetric. 
Such detailed work is now a program in collaboration with A. May 
and T. van Albada. I have argued here that the results will be 
rather interesting (Norman, May and van Albada 1983) . 
It is a pleasure to acknowledge interesting and useful discussions 
with Ray Carlberg, Jerry Sellwood, Tjeerd van Albada, Andrew May,

to thank Jean Audouze for his excellent hospitality at La Plagne 
during this stimulating workshop.

A GALAXY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION? 
Phi lippe Crane 
European Southern Observatory 
Abstract :  
A galaxy distribution function based on the statisti­
cal thermodynamics of gravitating objects is compared to data 
from the Zwick:y catalogue of galaxies. The data are well repre­
sented by the proposed function. However ,  there remain some sys­
tematic effects to be modelled. 
INTRODUCTION 
Saslaw and Hamilton (ref. 1 ) have proposed a function to 
describe the dis tribution of galaxies. This function is based on 
the statistical thermodynamics of gravitationally interacting 
bodies . It predicts the probability of finding a given number of 
galaxies in a particular volume given the mean number per unit 
volume. The function is: 
[N( 1 -b) + Nb]N- 1 
_ 
P(N) = 
N !  
N( 1 -b) exp - [N( 1 -b) + Nb] 
where N is the number of galaxies in volume V 
N = nV is the average number of galaxies in V and n is the 
mean number of galaxies per unit volume 
b = W/2K is the ratio of the correlation potential (W) to 
the kinetic energies (K) of the galaxies (see ref. 1 for 
details) . 
The parameter b in the equation is the interesting phys­
ical quanti ty. In the limit of uncorrelated motions of the test

objects , b = 0 and the expression for P(N) reduces to the 
Poisson distribution as would be expected. In the limit b = 1 
the quantity N( 1 -b )  => est and the expression fn P(N) describes 
a system in virial equilibrium. 
The derivation of the expression for P(N) given by Saslaw 
and Hamilton leaves several important questions to be answered . 
Among the most important are : 1 )  whether an equilibrium thermo­
dynamic solution can be used to describe the distribution of 
galaxies and 2) whether the particular ansatz used to derive the 
result is physically correct. Perhaps the best way to test this 
result is to compare it to the real world . This is done in the 
next section. 
APPLICATION TO THE ZWICKY CATALOGUE 
The Zwicky Catalogue of galaxies ( ref. 2) represents a 
reasonably good sample of galaxies on which to test the proposed 
galaxy distribution function. Any solid angle on the sky with 
galaxy counts to a fixed limiting magnitude represents a sample 
of some volume. Another equal solid angle sampled to the same 
limiting magnitude is a sample of an equivalent volume with a 
similar degree of incompleteness. Thus the counts of galaxies in 
a given solid angle in the Zwicky catalog represent a data set 
which can be compared to the proposed galaxy distribution. In 
particular ,  galaxy counts in some arbitrary solid angle are made 
for many different areas in the Zwicky catalog. The histogram of 
these results is then compared to the function P(N ) .  Figure 1 
shows a typical histogram of galaxy with a plot of the fitted 
function 
F (n )  
= P(N) + A exp -
(N/N0 ) .  
An exponential was added to the function P(N) t o  account 
for the fact that there are far too many occurrences of areas 
with no or few galaxies compared to the predictions of the for­
mula P ( N ) .  This is most likely due to edge effects in our sample 
and in the Zwicky catalog itself. In any case , this ad hoc addi­
tion of an exponential does not affect the main conclusions . 
Many different samples were taken with varying solid 
angles , with varying ways of choosing the shape of solid angles 
of equal size , and with varying galactic latitude limits .  Essen­
tially all the derived distributions were well described by the 
function P(N) with various values of the parameter "b" .  In this 
case , "well described" means that the chi-squared values had the 
e xpec ted distribution .

described in the text. The value of b in this case is 
0 . 7 1  ± 0 . 05 and the chi-squared is 64 - 1 6  for 65 degrees of 
freedom. 
DISCUSSION : 
Two trends in the derived values of "b" were evident . 
First, b depends on the galactic latitude limit chosen. Second , 
b depends on the size of the solid angle . Both of these trends 
have likely explanations. Nevertheless , they have not yet been 
quantitatively explained , and work is in progress to model these 
trends . 
The dependence of "b " on galactic la ti tu de is shown in 
Figure 2 . Here ,  small values of b are found at low galactic lat­
itude . Small b values correspond to more random and less cor­
related galaxy distributions. This result is attributed to a 
random distribution of absorbing clouds at lower galactic lati­
tudes which will make the galaxy distribution appear more 
random.

The dependence of "b" o f  the size of the solid angle 
chosen is shown in Figure 3. Here , small solid angles produce 
small values of b. Small solid angles will only sample small 
portions of nearby groups or clusters due to small angular 
coverage and small portions of more distant groups and clusters 
due to incompleteness. Hence small solid angles will tend not to 
sample virialized or close to virialized groups and clusters in 
this sample. Large solid angles will be more likely to sample 
virialized groups and hence the values of b derived will tend to 
be larger. 
Independent of the validity of the physical reasoning that 
went into deriving the formula of Saslaw and Hamilton, the 
formula gives excellent agreement with the observed distribu­
tions in the Zwicky catalog. Nevertheless , further work on other 
samples will be necessary to confirm the validity of the expres­
sion in general .

THE THICKNESS OF GALACTIC DISKS 
R . G. Carlberg 
University of Toronto 
I. Introduction 
The local dynamical structure of disk galaxies is broadly 
characterized by a vertical scale height which is nearly 
independent of radius , the scale height being about 1/10 of the 
horizontal scale length (Searle and van der Kruit , 1982) and an 
internal population structure wherein the oldest stars have the 
largest random velocities (for an analysis of the data see Wielen 
1977) .  Almost all disk galaxies contain gas and exhibit signs 
of ongoing star format ion , indicating formation on a t ime scale 
comparable to the Hubble time . 
The slow and ongoing process of 
forming gas into stars has been shown by Sellwood and Carlberg 
(1983) to be vital to the continual presence of transient spiral 
waves . 
The density waves have associated potential waves which 
Carlberg and Sellwood (1983) and Carlberg (1983) suggest are the 
dominant mechanism driving secular evolution of the disk. 
This 
paper reviews the arguments for transient spiral wave heating , 
concentrating on the problems of wave heating in the vertical 
direction. 
The aim of this paper is to establish that the 
velocity dispersions in the disk are due to secular evolution , 
and nearly independent of cosmological conditions . 
II. Why Transient Spirals? 
In order that spiral waves have a significant dynamical 
effect they must be transient , and varying on a time scale 
comparable to the basic frequencies of oscillation in the disk, 
343

344 
R. G. CARLBERG 
otherwise the adiabatic invariants insure that the disk will 
return to its initial state after the waves have come and gone. 
Spiral waves with a lifetime comparable to a rotation period 
have been observed in many N body experiments of disk galaxies 
(Lindblad 1960 , Miller , Prendergast , and Quirk 1970, Hohl 1971 , 
Hockney and Brownrigg 1974 , Sellwood and James 1978) . 
The 
associated heating is so powerful that within a few rotation 
periods the disk particles acquire such high random velocities 
that the disk becomes almost completely stable to spiral 
instab ilit ies . 
A problem then arises since most disk galaxies 
are 100 rotations periods old , yet virtually all have some sort 
of spiral structure. 
Sellwood and Carlberg (1983) showed that dynamical cooling , 
associated with dissipation in the gas and accret ion of gas onto 
the disk of the galaxy , continually destabilizes the galaxy 
sufficiently that spirals can reform. 
The spirals that are observed in the experiments have many 
features in common with the swing amplification theory presented 
by Toomre (1981) . 
All spiral patterns start as weak leading 
spirals , which shear around to trailing spirals growing by a 
factor of 3 to 10 in amplitude. 
The waves then continue to wind 
up on to the resonances , gradually dwindling in amplitude . 
The 
growth and decay rates are comparable for two patterns that were 
measured and the growth rates were 1/2 and 1/5 of the pattern 
speeds of the associated waves . 
Although we do not yet have a 
complete description of the evolution of spirals , the swing 
amplification description is consistent with most of the 
behaviour of an individual pattern. 
III . 
Horizontal Heating by Spirals 
The wave heating balances the dynamical cooling at an 
equilibrium value of the velocity dispersion. The average radial 
velocity dispersion , ou, of the disk is conveniently measured 
by the dimensionless parameter Q = CTuK/(3 . 36GI) , where I is the 
disk surface density and K is the epicyclic frequency. 
In the N 
body experiments the equilibrium Q is found to be only weakly 
sensitive to the cooling rate, and to maintain a value near to 
2 ,  increasing from 1 . 7  to 2 . 3  for a factor of 10 decrease in 
the cooling rate. The value in the solar neighbourhood is 
est imated to be 1 . 5  to 2 . 0  (Toomre 1974) , and there are 
preliminary indications that other galaxies have comparable 
values (Kormendy and Illingworth , private communication) . 
The mechanism governing the heating is well described by 
considering the changes induced in a disk by a perturbation to 

THE THICKNESS OF GALACTIC DISKS 
345 
the axisyrnmetric potential .  As a first approximation for the 
determination of the behaviour in the plane of the galaxy the 
thickness can be ignored. 
The change in the phase space 
distribution induced by a transient spiral wave is found by 
linearizing Liouville' s  equation for the conservation of phase 
space density. 
The first order change phase mixes away, giving 
no change in the distribution function. 
The second order change in the distribution function, f ,  
due t o  a single transient spiral is an equation in the form of 
a diffusion in phase space (derived in Carlberg and Sellwood 
1983) , 
D.2/(ɏ, w) 
(1) 
The _ ndependent variables are chosen to be the action variables , 
J 
= (h,J ) where h is the angular momentum, and Jr is the radial 
action, &hich for an epicyclic of radial amplitude a is 
Jr 
= l/2Ka2. 
The complementary variables are the phase angles , 
w. The vector 1!l is an integer vector of the Fourier indices . 
The diffusion in phase space induced by the transient spirals 
is governed by diffusion coefficient , which is composed of the 
product of ਠm' which are Fourier transforms of the perturbing 
Ɏotential over the unperturbed orbits , and the tuning factor 
Tm which indicates how wel l  matched the perturbing potential ' s  
frequency is t o  the natural frequencies o f  oscillation in the 
disk. 
A simple model of the spiral waveform with a constant pitch 
angle was used to investigate the velocity dependence of the 
heating rate. In the limit that the epicycles are small 
compared to the distance between crests of the spiral wave the 
heating is independent of the initial size of the epicycle, and 
for one spiral the increase in the velocity dispersion is 
approximately, 
(2) 
where k' is the effective wavenumber of the spiral. 
If spirals 
with similar properties recur at a constant rate in time then 
the increase of the velocity dispersion wiਡɌ age for a coeval 
group of stars would be 03 ɍ t ,  or o 
̍ t11 . However as the 
velocity dispersion increases , and tge size of the epicycles 

346 
R. G. CARLBERG 
increases to a size comparable or larger than one wavelength of 
the spiral wave , the heating rate diminishes to a minimum of 
0 ਓ tl/5 . 
u 
Heating by spiral waves therefore gives a natural explana­
t ion to the mean velocity horizontal dispersion of stars in a 
disk and the shape of the age velocity dispersion relation. 
IV. Vertical Heating 
Wave heating in the plane of the disk so well that one 
might assume that heating in the vertical direction works 
equally well. 
However wave heat ing in the vertical direction is 
vexed by a number of difficulties , and at the moment no guidance 
is available from N body simulations which adequately resolve 
the population structure of the disk. 
The basic difficulty is that heating by spirals with mot ions 
completely in the plane is extremely slow in the vertical 
direction for stars on orbits smaller than the thickness of the 
perturbing layer. There are two causes of the inefficient 
heating , the first being that the vertical frequency of 
oscillation is much higher than the horizontal frequency of 
oscillation. 
In the solar neighbourhood įz 
̌ 3k and the pattern 
speed of the waves is likely smaller than K .  
The vertical 
oscillation is so rapid that a spiral wave appears as an 
adiabatic variation , which producing no permanent change in the 
vertical component of the orbits .  The other difficulty is 
illustrated by the equation for the increase in the vertical 
velocity dispersion (Carlberg and Sellwood 1983) , 
(3) 
where K..L is the spiral wavenumber measured perpendicular to the 
crests .  The increase in the velocity dispersion increases with 
initial value of the velocity dispersion. 
A ratio of the 
heating rate (2) and (3) shows that for stars of relatively low 
velocity dispersion the heating in the vertical direction falls 
short of the required amount by about an order of magnitude. 
The cause of this behaviour is simply that the star never feels 
a vertical force if it happens to start exactly at z = 0, s ince 
the perturbing layer is symmetrical about that point . 
Away from 
the plane the perturbing force increases linearly with height 
for a constant density perturbing layer. 

THE THICKNESS OF GALACTIC DISKS 
347 
There are two solution to the problem of heating the lowest 
velocity dispersion stars , but they both come with their own 
difficulties. 
In the pure wave heating picture the obvious Ύhing 
to do is to include vertical mot ions of the perturbing laryer . 
There are two types of vertical motions of the spiral wave. 
The perturbing layer may respond so as to keep the vertical 
adiabatic invariant , proportional to z .1L: , constant . 
This mot·ion 
is symmetrical about the plane and does not significantly 
increase the heating. 
A more promising wave mot ion is a bending where the plane 
of the perturbing layer oscillates about the midlayer of the 
stellar distribution. 
The heating was investigated by 
integrating orbits in a disk containing the imposed spiral 
potential . 
For a disk with structure parameters scaled to the 
solar neighbourhood , i . e. a scale height of 300 pc in a disk 
with a flat rotat ion curve , particles that are started with an 
identical oscillation amplitude of 100 pc experience little 
vertical heating. 
However the main action of the wave is to 
scatter particles about their initial amplitude of oscillation , 
which will widen any initial distribution of velocities , and 
will lead to a net increase of the velocity dispersion. 
An 
oscillation amplitude of 50 pc generates a rat io of the spread 
in horizontal velocity amplitude to the spread in vertical 
velocity amplitude of about 1/2 ,  the observed ratio of velocity 
dispersions being CTwfou = 0 . 5 .  If the stars start off with an 
oscillation amplitude of only 50 pc the ratio of the spread 
in the velocit ies is reduced to about 1/3. This ratio of spread 
in the velocity amplitudes about their initial values is found 
to be very insensitive to the details of the waves , although 
the absolute magnitude of the increase of either does depend 
on the strength of the perturbation and the wavenumber of the 
spiral. For oscillations of the perturbing layer greater than 
the amplitude of the initial orbits ,  no significant increase in 
heating occurs . 
The orbit integrations show that vert ical oscillations of 
the perturbing layer are capable of providing heating of the 
observed magnitude . 
Do these vert ical oscillat ions actually 
exist ? The theoretical situat ion is unclear , but discouraging. 
The detailed analysis of Hunter and Toomre (1969 , see also Shu 
et al . 1983) of purely vertical bending waves found that the 
waves have a very small amplitude in the inner part of the disk, 
and there is no evidence for instability of modes with m > 1 .  
Bertin and Mark (1980 , see also Mark 1983) found similarly small 
amplitudes of vertical bending waves in the inner disk, but 
argued that the inclusion of a spherical halo could lead to an 
instability. 
In spite of theory (see Toomre 1983 for a 
discussion , mostly of warps) observations of the galactic disk 
to indicate the presence of distortions from the plane of 

348 
R. G. CARLBERG 
symmetry within the solar circle . 
Quiroga (1974) finds that 
the HI plane has regular distortions plane with an amplitude 
of 70 pc , and in the molecular cloud layer Solomon et al . (1979) 
and Cohen et al. (1979) report deviations of 40 pc from the plane . 
The situation for waves with a vertical component of 
oscillation is therefore far from being clear . 
The modes of 
oscillation and a source of amplification are not known. 
The 
observations certainly indicate deviations of the regions of 
maximum emission in the gas layer , but it is not known how well 
this reflects deviations of the total perturbing potential . 
Another possible source of the increase in the vertical 
oscillations is scattering off molecular clouds . 
The analysis 
of Lacey (1983) shows that interactions of stars and massive 
gas clouds heats the stars on a long time scale , but the inter­
actions drive the velocity ellipsoid towards an equilibrium 
shape on a shorter t ime scale. 
From the data presented by Lacey 
one expects that stars that are heated in the plane by any 
mechanism will be scattered out of the plane on a t ime scale of 
a few billion years . 
A difficulty arises if the scattering sends 
the distribution all the way to equilibrium, in which case the 
vertical velocity dispersion is predicted to exceed the tangential 
velocity dispersion , contrary to observations . 
Wave heating for stars with vertical oscillation amplitudes 
exceeding the scale height of the disk is sufficient to provide 
considerable heating. The increase in effectiveness is due 
to the decrease in the vertical frequency of oscillation of the 
stars with increasing height , which provides a better match to 
the driving frequency of the perturbing spiral . 
However in 
this case the size of the epicycles is comparable to the spiral 
wavelength, and there is considerable interplay between the 
heat ing in the two directions . At the moment the nature of 
the interaction is not well enough understood to make a 
prediction of the expected velocity distribution. 
V. Conclusions 
Heating by transient spiral waves has a feedback mechanism 
which adj usts the amplitude of the spirals to the average random 
velocities of stars in a disk galaxy , and provides a natural 
explanat ion to the mean radial velocity dispersion observed in 
galactic disks , and N body experiments. The shape of the 
observed age velocity dispersion relations can be predicted with 
a diffusion equation , where the rate of diffusion is dependent 
on the properties of the transient spirals , and the velocity 
dispersion of the stars being heated . 

THE THICKNESS OF GALACTIC DISKS 
349 
The thickness of disk galaxies and the vertical velocity 
dispersion is not so easily explained. 
Either spiral waves 
with a bending motion , or scattering of orbits out of the plane 
by large gas clouds would be capable of providing vertical 
velocities of approximately the right magnitude. The cloud 
scattering mechanism in equilibrium predicts the wrong shape of 
the velocity ellipsoid , and the understanding of vertical wave 
oscillat ions and their effects on vertical mot ions is very 
incomplete.

HEATING OF STELLAR DISKS BY MASSIVE OBJECTS

ABSTRACT 
I consider the possibility that the heating of stellar disks may 
be due to scattering of the stars by massive obj ects , either 
giant molecular clouds in the disk or massive black holes in the 
galactic halo . 
I find that the molecular cloud mechanism probably 
cannot be the main one because it predicts a ratio of vertical-to­
horizontal velocity dispersions in conflict with that observed . 
The halo black hole mechanism can account well for the solar 
neighbourhood kinematics , but the variation of disk scale-height 
with radius that it predicts appears to disagree with that 
observed . 
These results suggest that large scale perturbations 
of the disk potential , such as spiral density waves, are involved 
in stellar heating . 
1 . 
INTRODUCTION 
A long-standing problem in galactic evolution is to explain why, 
in the solar neighbourhood at least , the velocity dispersions of 
disk stars increase with their age (see Wielen ( 1 974) for a recent 
observational analysis) . 
As argued by Wielen ( 1 977) , the form of 
the relation between velocity dispersion and age makes it seem 
likely that it is caused by stochastic acceleration of the stars 
after they are born, rather than resulting from any time-dependence 
of the velocity dispersion of the gas layer from which the stars 
form. 
This stochastic heating is of importance for at least two 
aspects of the structure and evolution of galactic disks: 
(i) their stability, and the development of spiral density waves 
etc . , depends on the stellar velocity dispersion (Toomre 1 964) , 
351 
J. Audouze and J. Tran Thanh Van (eds.}, 

352 
C. G. LACEY 
and (ii) the stellar scale-height , which is observed to be 
approximately independent of radius in other spiral galaxies 
(van der Kruit & Searle 1 981a,b) , depends on the vertical 
component of the velocity dispersion. 
One possible explanation for the stochastic heating that is worth 
investigating is that it results from the scattering of stars by 
much more massive obj ects . As is well known, the timescale for 
two-body encounters between stars to be effective is roughly 1 01 4  
years (Chandrasekhar 1 960) , but this timescale can be much shorter 
for encounters between stars and more massive objects , varying as 
1 /nM2 for objects with mass M and number density n. There are 
two populations of objects which may have sufficiently large 
masses and number densities to produce a significant effect over 
lifetime of the galaxy, having quite different dynamical properties: 
(i) Giant molecular clouds in the disk. These are observed to 
have masses in the range 105 - 1 06 M@ (Solomon & Sanders 1 980) 
and are dynamically "cold" in the sense that they are on nearly 
circular orbits in the disk with smaller velocity dispersions than 
the stars . Their possible role in disk heating was first discussed 
by Spitzer & Schwarzschild ( 1 951 ) .  
(ii) Massive black holes that might constitute the "dark matter" 
in galactic halos . This population would be dynamically "hot", 
being supported against gravity mainly by its velocity dispersion, 
which would greatly exceed that of the disk stars. 
2. CALCULATION OF THE STELLAR HEATING: COMMON FEATURES 
The calculations of stellar heating by molecular clouds and by 
halo black holes are similar . This section describes the common 
features .  
2 .  1 Assumptions . 
The principal assumptions I make are the following: 
(i) The orbits of the stars in the background galactic potential 
are described by epicyclic theory. 
(ii) The perturbers (molecular clouds or black holes) are much 
more massive than the stars . 
(iii) The effective duration of a typical encounter is short 
compared to an epicyclic period . 
(iv) The perturbation of stellar velocities is dominated by the 
effects of the many distant, weak encounters rather than by a 
few close, strong encounters so that the process can be treated 
as a diffusion in velocity space .

To derive the rates of change of the mean energies for a popula­
tion of stars , the expressions for <dEe/dt> and <dE2/dt> must be 
averaged over the stellar distribution. 
I assume that the dis­
tribution function is always in a quasi-steady state , so that the 
phase space density obeys f = f (Ee, E2 , J) and further that f is 
approximately exponential in the epicycl ic energies and so (by 
equations (4) and (5) ) Gaussian in the velocities :

The J-dependence of f has been suppressed because it makes no

3 . 2  Comparison with Observations . 
(29) 
Three independent comparisons of the theoretical predictions with 
observations are possible : 
(i) 
Shape of the Velocity Ellipsoid . If scattering by clouds is 
important , the velocity dispersion ratios should obey equations 
(26) and (27) . 
These predict Ow > CTv, whereas virtually all 
observational determinations given aw < Ov (e . g .  Delhaye 1 965) .

curve and of ov/ou locally give 1 .3 < S < 1 .8 ,  for which the 
theory predicts 0 . 6  < owlou < 0 . 8 ,  w͂ileƣfor typical disk stars 
the observed value í ow/ou ڍ 0 . 52 ± 0.05 (Wielen 1 974) . This 
comparison appears to rule out the cloud mechanism as being 
important unless there is a large distortion of the local stellar 
kinematics by a density wave . 
(ii) Age-dependence of the Velocity Dispersions . 
If the cloud 
masses and number c\7nsities are independent of time, the equation 
Ɋ29) predicts o Ǥ t 4 , whereas the observations imply o ƣ t! or 
tf 3  (Wielen 1 974) . 
In fact, the cloud number density at least is 
likely to be a function of time . The simplest assumption is that 
D in equation (28) is proportional to the star formation rate, in 
which case the discrepancy between the predicted and observed 
time-dependence remains (see Lacey & Fall 1 983) . One can also 
try to predict the magnitude of the heating using the observed 
cloud properties . Taking molecular cloud data from Liszt, Xiang 
and Burton ( 1 981 ) ,  I predict for the velocity dispersion of the _1 
oldest disk stars in the solar neighbourhood 1 3  < o (TD) < 54 kms , 
for an initial velocity dispersion of 1 0  kms-1 , ̀here th̿ un­
certainties allow for a factor of 2 error either way in the cloud 
masses and for the time-averaged value of D being up to a factor 
of 4 greater than the present one . The observed value is 
o(TD) 
ڎ 60-80 kms-1 (Wielen 1974) . Given the uncertainty in cloud 
masses , this comparison does not rule out the mechanism. 
(iii) Radial Dependence of the Disk Scale-height . The scale-height 
of the disk varies as hD 
  aD2 /µD, where oD is an effective 
average velocity dispersion and µD is the surface density . The 
radial variation of oD for heating by clouds can only be predicted 
if one makes some assumption about how the cloud properties vary 
with radius and time . 
If one assumes that D is proportional to 
1/4 
the star formation rate, then oD 
 µD (see Lacey & Fall 1 983) , so 
-! 
hD 
  µD 
' 
(30) 
and for an exponential disk, µD 
 exp(-aR) , 
hD 
  exp(aR/2) . 
(3 1 )  
This is not compatible with the observations of van der Kruit & 
Searle ( 1981 a,b) , who find the disk scale-heights in other spiral 
galaxies to be approximately independent of radius . 
I conclude that the cloud mechanism in the form assumed here 
probably cannot be the dominant disk heating mechanism. The best 
evidence for this comes from the ratio owlou, s ince the other 
tests depend on additional , uncertain, assumptions about cloud 
masses and about the variation of cloud properties with time and 
with radius . 
It is possible that the mechanism might work if

some of the assumptions were modified e.g. to allow for clustering 
of the clouds or induced stellar wakes (c . f .  Julian & Toomre 1 966) . 
4 .  HEATING BY HALO BLACK HOLES 
4 . 1  Theory. 
The approximation made in this case is that the stellar velocity 
dispersion is negligible compared to both the velocity dispersion 
of tਔe halo OH ਕnd the relative velocity of the disk and halo 
(Vc-VH) ,  where VH is the mean rotational velocity of the halo .

Therefore the time-dependence of the velocity dispersions is of

o(t) = (o2 (o) + D ' t) 2 , 
(35) 
while the ratio ow/Ou tends to a value given by the ratio of the 
heating rates in equations (32) and (33) :

( 1 . 3 ̽ 6 ̼ 1 .8) mentioned previously . 
(ii) Age-dependence of the Velocity Dispersions . Equation 
(35) gives o <v d ,  which agrees well with the observations . 
The 
magnitude of the heating cannot be predicted since MH is unknown . 
Rather, we can use the observations to determine MH . To obtain 

360 
C. G. LACEY 
a total velocity dispersion a á 80 kms- 1 for the oldest disk 
stars , one requires nH MH2

a halo density nH MH ڌ 1 0-2 M@ pc-3 .

so that 
(37) 
Then if the halo density varies as PH

is exponential , 
(38) 
This does not appear to be consistent with the observations of 
van der Kruit & Searle , even allowing for proj ection effects and 
letting Rc be a free parameter . 
Therefore it seems likely that 
halo black holes are not responsible for heating the disk ,  and 
the value of ̺ derived is best viewed as an upper limit . 
A fuller account of the calculation of heating by molecular clouds 
is contained in a paper submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal 
Astronomical Society . 
The calculation of heating by black holes 
was part of a collaborative proj ect with J . P .  Ostriker .

In this article we review recent observations of the rotation­
al properties of galaxies and clusters . We investigate whether 
these observations can be explained if galaxies and clusters were 
set in rotation by the tidal torques of their neighbours .  We 
present new results on the angular momentum-mass relation and on 
the dependence of angular momentum on initial conditions . These 
results are discussed within the context of the White-Rees model 
for galaxy formation. A new test of tidal torques is proposed.

INTRODUCTION 
The dimensionlesਗ spin-parameter 
( 1 )  
i s  a convenient quantity with which to parameterise the angular 
momentum content of galaxies and clusters . 
In equ . ( 1 )  J, E and 
M are respectively the total angular momentum, energy and mass of 
the system and G is the gravitational constant . 
If a proto-system collapses and reaches virial equilibrium 
without dissipating binding energy so that J ,  E and M are conserved 
during collapse, the dimensionless spin-parameter will also be 
conserved. 
Clusters and groups of galaxies are unlikely to have 
dissipated much binding energy because their radiative cooling 
times exceed a Hubble time (Rees and Ostriker 1977) . Measure­
ments of A in clusters and groups may, therefore, provide a direct 
estimate of the pre-collapse value of A for comparison with 
theoretical predictions .

If a proto-system collapses and dissipates binding energy , 
so that only J and M are conserved, the observed value of A may 
be compared with theoretical predictions to compute the ratio of 
the pre-collapse to final half-mass radius . Dissipation has clear­
ly played an important role in the formation of the disc components 
of spiral and lenticular galaxies but it is less clear whether 
this is the case for ellipticals and the bulges of disc galaxies .  
Indeed, several authors (eg . Sandage, Freeman and Stokes 1 970, 
Gott and Thuan 1976) have argued that the amount of binding energy 
dissipated during the collapse may determine whether a proto­
galactic cloud becomes an elliptical or a spiral galaxy. 
The 
rotational properties of galaxies provide an important test of 
this idea. 
2 .  OBSERVATIONS 
2 .  1 Ellipticals .  
If ellipticals were rotationally flattened oblate spheroids 
with apparent ellipticity s ,  the ratio of the peak rotational 
velocity (vm) to the peak velocity dispersion (op) should obey the 
relation (Binney 1 978) 
v m 
0 p 
(2) 
where e2 
= 
- (1-s)2 • In the last few years rotation curves and 
velocity dispersion profiles have been measured for a large number 
of bright (MB < -19) 1 elliptical galaxies and it is now well 
established that most giant ellipticals rotate more slowly than 
is predicted by equ .  (2) (see e.g. Illingworth 1 98 1  and references 
therein) . This result may be understood if the flattening of 
giant ellipticals is due to anisotropic velocity dispersions rather 
than rotation (Binney, 1 978) . 
Recently, Davies et al . ( 1 983) have measured rotation curves 
and velocity dispersion profiles for 1 1  faint ellipticals (MB > -19) . 
They find that the rotational properties of ellipticals correlate 
with luminosity, with faint ellipticals rotating nearly as rapidly 
as predicted by equ. (2) (Figure 1 ) . A rough approximation to 
their results is the power-law relation 
where we have taken L

The bulges of several spiral and lenticular galaxies have 
been studied in some detail by Kormendy and Illingworth ( 1 982) 
and Illingworth and Schechter ( 1 982) . Most bulges have absolute 
magnitudes fainter than -19 and they are found to rotate rapidly, 
consistent with the predictions of the oblate isotropic model 
(equ . 2) and with the rotational properties of faint ellipticals .

(Freeman 1 970, Boroson 1 981 ) .  Rotation 
curves have been measured for a large number of disc galaxies 
using both 21 cm and optical emission lines (see e . g .  Rubin 1 983, 
Bosma 1983 and references therein) . 
In most cases the rotation 
curves are very nearly flat out to the limits of detectability1 
which usually corresponds to < the Holmberg radius rH  4 . 5  a 
The rotation curves , especially of late type discs , may be roughly 
parameterised by the relation

with arm typically within the range 0 . 1  to 0 .8 (Fall and Efstathiou 
1 980) . 
Flat rotation curves have usually been interpreted as evidence 
in support of dark haloes with density profile p (r) ] vm2 /4nGr2 
(see eg. Faber and Gallagher 1 979 for a review) . However , 
because of the lack of coordinated photometric and kinematic 
studies , this result should be viewed with some caution. Kalnaj s 
( 1 983) has used detailed surface photometry of four disc galaxies 
to predict their rotation curves under the assumption of a constant 
mass-to-light (M/L) ratio . The results agree remarkably well with 
the observed rotation curves .  Kalnaj s '  results illustrate the 
dangers of using mean relations such as equations (5) and (6) to 
infer the mass distribution in the outer parts of discs . 
The 
existence of dark haloes is of crucial importance to the present 
discussion. As we will show in Section (4) it seems that massive 
haloes are necessary if disc angular momentum was acquired by 
tidal torques . 
An additional uncertainty involves the amount of random 
motion in disc galaxies .  We will assume that discs are cold 
(a<<vm) in analogy with the kinematics of stars in the local solar 
neighbourhood (a Ŵ 40 km sec-1 , v 
á 250 km sec-1 ) .

2 . 4 .  The Coma Cluster. 
There are few rich clusters with enough measured redshifts 
to make a search for rotation worthwhile, so we will confine the 
discussion to Coma, the best studied of all the rich clusters . 
Several authors have investigated the central regions ( 8  < 180 
arcmin) but no rotation has yet been detected (Peebles 19}1 ,  Rood 
et al . 1 972, Gregory 1 975) . We have re-examined this problem 
using the extensive list of redshifts given by Kent and Gunn 
( 1 982) . We compute the quantities (Peebles 197 1 ) ,

velocity of the Coma cluster. We eliminate foreground and back­
ground galaxies using the following iterative technique . We reject 
galaxies with radial velocities outside the range v±2 . 5ov where ov 
is the measured cluster velocity dispersion . We then recompute 
v, ov tx and ty and repeat the background-foreground check. This 
procedure converges very rapidly for emax < 1 80 '  (cf . Figure 1 of

are the expected variances of tx and ty respectively under the 
assumption that (xi ,Vi) and (yi,vi) are uncorrelated . 
To check 
this assumption and to interpret these results in terms of the 
\-parameter we have computed a series of Monte-Carlo s imulations 
of the Coma cluster . The surface density profile (Kent and Gunn 
1 982 Figure 6) is well fitted by a de-Vaucouleurs ' r1 /4 law with 
effective radius re 
= 65 .3 arcmin. We have used this model to 
generate spherical clusters of 400 points with isotropic velocity 
dispersions calculated from the equations of stellar hydrodynamics . 
The peak projected velocity dispersion was fixed at 1 1 00 km sec-1 
and each cluster was set in cylindrical rotation with a constant 
rotational velocity and a randomly oriented spin axis . The 
clusters were projected along the line of sight and analyzed as 
described above . 
The results are summarized in Table 2 .

points very nearly along the line of sight . 
We have also checked for rotation around the apparent minor 
axis . Coma is highly flattened, with E = 0.47±0 .07 and a major 
axis position angle of 74°±4° for 8 <v1 arcmin (Carter and Metcalfe 
1980, Schipper and King 1 978) . Fitting a flat rotation curve we 
find Vrot = 60±90 km sec-1 (positive values correspond to NE 
receeding) so there is no evidence for rotation around the apparent 
minor axis, in agreement with previous work. 
Note that if Coma were oblate with isotropic velocity dis­
persions , equ. (2) predicts vm/op á 0 .95 which is clearly excluded 
by the observations . 
If Coma were more nearly prolate with iso­
tropic velocity dispersions we could get the observed results only 
if the angular momentum vector were very nearly parallel to the 
line of sight . Assuming that clusters have the same ellipticity 
distribution as elliptical galaxies (cf . Carter and Metcalfe 1 980) 
we can use Figure 4 of Binney ( 1 978) to assign a probability of 
< 2% for getting the observed result. It therefore seems likely 
̸hat the flattening of Coma is due to anisotropic velocity 
dispersions rather than rotation. 
2 . 5 .  The Local Supercluster 
Several authors have searched for rotation in the Local 
Supercluster (Rubin 1 95 1 ,  de Vaucouleurs 1 958, 1972, Stewart and 
Sciama 1967) . In the most recent study, Aaronson et al . ( 1 982) 
use the infra-red Tully-Fisher relation to test for infall of 
nearby galaxies towards the Virgo cluster centre .  They find an 
infall velocity of 250±64 km sec- 1  at the position of the Local 
Group. 
In addition, they have tested for differential rotation 
assuming spheroidal rotation of the form 
v(r) = v rot 
(8) 
(de Vaucouleurs 1958) where RLG is the distance of the Local Group 
to the centre of Virgo . 
Interestingly, they find vrot=180±58 km 
sec-1 . 
It is not possible to convert this result into a unique value 
of ;\ for the Local Supercluster since we can add an arbitrary 
amount of solid body rotation to equ. (8) without altering the 
predicted line of sight velocity of a galaxy. Nevertheless, to 
compare with the theoretical predictions of the next Section and 

THE ORIGIN OF ROTATION IN GALAXIES AND CLUSTERS 
to see what sort of rotational motions we might expect in a 
structure like the Local Supercluster we have calculated \ for 
a system with a flat rotation curve and an r-2 density profile, 
Vrot

where IG is the ratio of the mean matter density to the critical 
density in an Einstein-de Sitter model ,  o is the mean overdensity 
of material within a radius R from the centre and we have neglected 
the effect of material at radii greater than R. 
3 .  TIDAL TORQUES 
One of the consequences of the gravitational instability 
picture of galaxy formation is that individual proto-structures 
would have been set in rotation by the tidal torques from their 
neighbours .  Hoyle ( 1 949) was the first to suggest that this 
mechanism might account for the rotation of galaxies and the idea 
was refined further by Peebles ( 1 969) . Peebles used linear 
perturbation theory to estimate the r .m. s .  angular momentum in 
randomly placed spheres and matched the results to a simple non­
linear model in which the torque on a proto-system was calculated 
as the product of its quadrupole moment with the tidal field of 
neighbouring point masses .  Assuming that density perturbations 
at recombination can be approximated as a random Gaussian process 
with a power-spectrum 
Peebles derived A 
ē 0 . 08 for n 
ty of about a factor of three .  
( 10) 
- 1 /2 with a theoretical uncertain-
A more accurate estimate may be obtained from N-body simul­
ations (Peebles 1 97 1 , Efstathiou and Jones 1 979 , hereafter EJ) . 
In particular, the latter authors studied the tidal torque process 
using 1000 particle models with IG=1 and Poisson initial conditions . 
For bound clumps they find the median value of \ to be Arne = 0 .06 . 
The distribution of \ shows a large scatter; the 90 and 1 0  per­
centile points of the distribution lie at \ =  0 . 1 1  and \ = 0 . 03 
respectively. 
Recently we have run a large numerical experiment using the 
numerical scheme described by Efstathiou and Eastwood ( 1 98 1 ) . 
The model contains 20000 particles which were initially distributed 
at random positions inside a cube of unit volume . The cosmological 
density parameter was set to IG=1 . Figure 3 shows a projection of 
the particle distribution after the system had expanded by a

Another problem that we have begun to study concerns the 
dependence of the tidal torque results on the power-spectrum 
index n (equ. 10) . The linear calculation of Peebles ( 1 969) does 
not help to aਘswer this question because the r .rn. s .  angular 
momentum <J2 >2x in a randomly placed sphere of radius x involves 
a summation which couples long-wavelength modes with short­
wavelengths where the clustering is highly non-linear. 
If the 
power-spectrum } 10) is extrapolated to arbitrarily high k one 
finds that <J2 >2x diverges if n lies outside the range -1<n<O . The 
quadrupole model of Thuan and Gott ( 1 977) suggests that tidal­
torques should be relatively insensitive to the primordial rnass­
distribution, though it is doubtful that this model is sufficiently 
realistic to provide more than a rough guide. 
The results of a series of small (N Ę 1 000) simulations 
run with ǽ=1 are summarized in Table 3 .  The first column gives 
the initial particle distribution. The cells distribution is set 
up by placing one particle at a random location in each of N 
contiguous cubical volumes and corresponds to n = +2 on scales 
larger than the interparticle separation. 
The rods distribution 
is set up by placing a number of rods, with particles at fixed 
spacing along each rod, at random orientations within the comput­
ational volume. This distribution corresponds to a power-spectrum 
with n = -1 on scales larger than the interparticle separation 
(Aarseth, Gott and Turner 1979) . The third column gives the mean 
value of \ for the groups with density contrast op/p 
= 10 con­
taining more than 1 0  particles which were identified after each 
model had expanded by a factor of 8 . 4 .  The fourth column gives 
the mean value of the dimensionless parameter K defined as

columns give the median value of A for groups with masses less 
than and greater than the median group mass respectively .  The 
final column gives the exponent of the specific angular rnornenturn­
rnass relation. 
The results from the cells and rods experiments agree 
qualitatively with those from the Poisson models .  The median 
value of A for high mass groups is slightly smaller than that 
for low mass groups in agreement with the trend seen in Figure 4 .  
The median value o f  A is not particularly sensitive to initial 
conditions ; note that the median value of A for the cells 
experiments may be too low because our criterion that groups 
should contain more than 1 0  members means that we sample only 
the richest groups (containing á 1 0% of the total mass) whereas 
in the Poisson and rods experiments we sample a wider range of 
group masses . 
We have also testec1. the sensitivity of these results to 
the overdensity criterion used to identify groups . The median 
value of A is extremely insensitive to the density contrast (cf . 
also EJ) . 
The test is reliable only for op /p < 30 in the 20000 
body experiment, since the softening of the gr̲vitational potential 
significantly influences estimates of the potential energy if 
op/p > 30 . 
In the experiments run with Aarseth ' s  code we used a 
hardei potential which allows a reliable test to op/p ] 50 . 
4 .  DISCUSSION 
4 . 1  Clusters of Galaxies 
The results of the previous section suggest that clusters 
of galaxies should rotate slowly, with A
]
 0 .07 . This is certain­
ly consistent with the observational results described in Sections 
2 . 4  and 2 . 5  for Corna and the Local Supercluster. Further, the K 
parameter (equ .  1 3) shows that vcrn C Vrot if 2 > n > -1 . Thus 
the agreement between the infall velocity derived by Aaronson et 
al . ( 1 982) and our motion with respect to the microwave background 
radiation does not necessarily exclude the possibility that the 
rotation of the Local Supercluster was caused by tidal torques . 
If the tidal torque theory is correct, the flattening of 
relaxed galaxy clusters must be due to anisotropic velocity 
dispersions . 
It would be interesting to test in detail whether 
tidal interactions between neighbouring protostructures can 
account for the observed distribution of cluster flattenings . 
Theoretical calculations by Binney and Silk ( 1 979) indicate that 
tidal interactions lead to prolate structures with typical 
ellipticities E: ` 0 . 2  - 0 . 3 .

4 . 2  Disc Galaxies 
Recent applications of the cosmic virial theorem indicate 
ͧ 
= 0 . 2  x 1 . 5±1 under the assumption that galaxies are good 
tracers of the mass distribution (Davis and Peebles 1 983, Bean 
et al . 1 983) . This implies a mean mass-to-luminosity ratio of M/L 
Ŵ 300 (ͧ/0 . 2) which is compatible with the M/L values deduced from 
studies of rich clusters and groups but far in excess of the M/L 
values inferred within the optical radii of elliptical and spiral 
galaxies (M/L ˘ 3-1 5) . Any theory of galaxy formation should 
take into account the large amounts of dark material implied by 
these observations and should explain why the M/L values for the 
inner parts of galaxies are so much smaller than the mean . 
White and Rees (1 978) propose the following model . Most 
of the material in the universe is assumed to be in a dark 
component which can cluster gravitationally but does not dissipate 
energy. Any of the usual candidates for the dark component such 
as low mass stars , the remnants of supermassive stars or massive 
(> 1 keV) weakly interacting particles would be acceptable . 
Primordial gas accounts for only a small fraction of the mean mass 
density (˘1 -10%) but can radiatively cool and dissipate binding 
energy to form the dense luminous components of galaxies . Each 
galaxy would have formed within the potential wel l  of a dark halo 
and the high overdensities and low M/L ratios of galaxies can be 
explained if the gas collapsed by a factor of ͥ10 in radius before 
fragmenting into stars . The requirement that the gas should cool 
on a time-scale shorter than the Hubble time leads to an upper 
mass limit of ͥ1 01 2  M6 which agrees with the masses of large 
galaxies . 
In this theory, it is reasonable to expect that the 
specific angular momentum of the gas should be equal to that of 
the dark halo material , 
( 1 4) 
This is because all the material in the protosystem experiences 
the same external torques before separating into two distinct 
components . 
(However, note that if the primordial gas is ionized, 
it would stay locked to the comoving frame by Compton drag for 
z > 1 40 (ͧ) 1 15 in which case Jn/Mn could be less than JH/MH, Hogan 
19l9) . The numerical experiments described in the previous section 
predict that a typical protosystem will have a pre-collapse spin 
parameter ;\ ˘ 0.07 .  We now wish to compute the factor by which the 
gas must collapse to produce a centrifugally supported disc with 
an exponential surface density profile (equ.5) and a flat rotation 
curve with amplitude Vm out to some limiting radius RH . 
If the 
disc ' s  self-gravity is neglected, the halo profile is

and we will assume that 
The disc ' s  angular momentum is

and, since the halo component does not dissipate binding energy we

( 18) 
which agrees well with the more detailed computations of Fall and 
Efstathiou ( 1 980) . 
If AH = 0.07, we find aRH ] 20 which is 
compatible with observational arguments which suggest that the 
disc collapsed by a factor of Ǥ1 0  (Eggen, Lynden-Bell and Sandage 
1 962) . 
In this model , the ratio MH/MD depends on the parameter Y 
(equ. 1 7) which cannot be directly determined from observations of 
disc galaxies . Theoretical arguments concerning the stability of 
disc galaxies suggest that Y આ 1 . 1  (Efstathiou, Lake and Negroponte 
1 982) in which case MH/MD ͥ 20(0 .07/AH) which agrees roughly with 
the parameters required by the White-Rees theory . 
If there are no heavy haloes , the protocloud must collapse 
by an excessively large factor if it is to form a centrifugally 
supported disc . 
If we approximate the protocloud as a uniform 
sphere of radius Ri and total energy Ei = -3/5 GM2 /Ri l we get 
aRi = 1 50 (0.07/Ai) 2 • For a disc of scale length a-
= 3 kpc and 
mass 101 1  M0, the free-fall time is tff ] n (Ri3 /8GM) ! ˘ 2x1 01 0 yrs 
which is unreasonably long . Thus , if dark haloes do not exist , it 
is difficult to see how the tidal torque theory could account for 
the origin of disc angular momentum. 
Several authors (Faber, 1 982, Burstein and Sarazin 1 983 , 
Fall 1 983 , and ourselves) have noticed that, under certain special 
assumptions , the arguments summarized in equs . ( 14)- ( 1 8) can lead 
to relations similar to those inferred from the infra-red Tully­
Fisher relation (vm 4 
a: Ln) and Freeman' s  law ( I0 
= canst, equ. 5) :

( 1 9b) 
To explain the observations requires that MH/MO á const ,  MH 
cr RH2 ,  
(MD/LD) á const, AH ] const or some other special relations between 
these quantities . 
Since some of these relations are highly un­
certain we do not propose to give a detailed discussion here. 
Instead, we wish to consider the following point . We have 
mentioned in Section (3) that the tidal-torque theory predicts a 
broad spread in A, so if the model for disc formation sketched 
above is correct, we should see this scatter reflected in the 
properties of present day spiral s .  Now we know that the scatter 
in the infra-red Tully-Fisher relation is small (eg. Aaronson et 
al . 1982) and this also seems to be true in the B-band if Hubble 
type is used as an indicator of MD/LD (Rubin 1 983) . These results 
suggest that the combination (MH/MD) MHRH-2 in equ . ( 1 9a) has a 
fairly small scatter . 
If MH/MD is fairly constant, equ. ( 1 9b) says 
that we should see the scatter in AH reflected as a large spread in 
I0 • As a test of this idea we have compared the distribution of 
I0-! for the disc galaxies studied by Boroson ( 1 98 1 )  with the 
distribution of A measured in the N-body experiments (Figure 5) . 
The distributions agree quite well once we have matched the area 
under each curve and the position of the median values .  Of course,

THE ORIGIN OF ROTATION IN GALAXIES AND CLUSTERS 
our main purpose in presenting this graph is to illustrate what 
might turn out to be an interesting test of the tidal torque 
theory given more photometry and an independent indicator of 
Mn/LD (perhaps Hubble type or colour) . 
It may even be possible 
to test for the mass dependence of A predicted in Section 3 .  
4 . 3  Elliptical Galaxies 
375 
As discussed above, the low M/L values in the inner parts 
of elliptical galaxies and their high overdensities argue against 
dissipationless collapse models .  Consistent with this , the A 
values inferred for ellipticals with L < L* exceed the median 
values found in the numerical simulations . One possibility is 
that ellipticals formed by the dissipative collapse of gas in 
dark haloes (Kashlinsky 1 982, Faber 1 982) . 
If the protosystem is 
approximated as a uniform sphere of radius Ri with spin parameter 
Ai , the requirement that JE/ME = JH/MH (here the subscript E refers 
to "elliptical") leads to the following relation for the ratio of 
rotational velocity to central velocity dispersion of the luminous 
component, 
v I a 
m p 
(20) 
Here f is the ratio of dark mass to luminous mass interior to the 
effective radius re and we have assumed that the luminous component 
rotates on cylinders with a flat rotation curve and a flat 
dispersion profile . 
If the relaxed halo component approximates 
an isothermal we must have re/Ri ͦ Ɉ f/2 ̱· Equ . (20) then gives 
(21 )  
where we have inserted values for the parameters in rough agree­
ment with those expected in the White-Rees theory. 
If equ. (21 ) 
is compared with the observations (equ .3) we see that ellipticals 
must have formed in protosystems with unusually low values of A 
(ਙ0 . 0 1 )  or low values of MH/ME · The main problem with this model 
lies in accounting for the observation that ellipticals occur 
predominantly in rich clusters of galaxies for it is difficult to 
see how A or MH/ME could be correlated on scales of galaxy clusters 
at the time of galaxy formation. 
Other possibilities, such as galaxy mergers and tidal 
stripping are discussed by Davies et al . ( 1 983) and Fall ( 1 983) . 
But it is tempting to speculate on whether the properties of 
elliptical galaxies could be explained if primordial fluctuations 
were non-Gaussian (Peebles 1 983) .

ABSTRACT We discuss a new correlation between the mean surf ace 
brightness within the effective radius of elliptical galaxies ,  
and their level of rotational support using published data. The 
latter parameter is described by the ratio of rotation velocity 
to velocity dispersion, normalised to the value required to 
stabalise an isotropic, oblate galaxy of the observed flattening. 
A stronger correlation results when the velocity dispersion is 
corrected for second parameter effects. The sense of the 
correlations is that rotation is more important for higher 
surface brightness ellipticals. We understand the correlations 
as resulting from an increased importance of dissipation during 
the formation and early evolution of the higher surface 
brightness galaxies. We envisage that ellipticals form by 
dissipative collapse in dark halo potentials , the amount of 
dissipation depending on the initial gas fraction. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Models for elliptical galaxy formation have assigned a 
varied importance to dissipation and to the role of dark matter. 
The observational evidence is not clear cut, but there have been 
some major advances in recent years. Early work revealed 
correlations of line strength, colour (1) and velocity dispersion 
(2) with absolute magnitude. These indicated that knowledge of 
one parameter - luminosity - was enough to specify an elliptical 
completely . 
Terlevich et al (3) ,  however, discovered a second 
parameter, manifest in correlated deviations from the mean

relations with luminosity. The second parameter is probably 
related to the chemistry or star formation history of the 
galaxy . 
381 
The observations that high luminosity ellipticals are 
generally (though not always) pressure supported (4 , and refs 
therein) while lower luminosity ellipticals are rotationally 
supported (5) were unexpected. 
The dependence of rotation on 
luminosity has been investigated (5) and used to test theories of 
elliptical galaxy formation. The slope of the correlation seems 
equally consistent, within the unfortunately large uncertainties, 
with the predictions from clustering hierarchies (with and 
without dissipation) , merging of stellar discs and dissipative 
pancake or blast wave scenarios. The amplitude of the relation 
i s  more difficult to explain (7 ) .  
2 ROTATION AND SURFACE HRIGHTNESS 
2 . 1  The Correlation 
Elliptical galaxy samples with a large luminosity baseline 
have surface brightness increasing with luminosity (5 , 6) . 
Since 
surface brightness is distance (and distance error) independent, 
unlike luminosity, a plot of surface brightness against rotation 
parameter should contain interesting information, to constrain 
theories of elliptical galaxy formation. 
Figure 1 shows mean surface brightness within the effective 
radius , versus (v/o)*, the observed rotation velocity: velocity 
dispersion ratio, divided by the value corresponding to an oblate 
isotropic model ( 8 ) . 
43 galaxies have the necessary data (5) .  
There is clearly a trend in that galaxies of higher surf ace 
brightness have higher rotation parameter. This is in the sense 
expected from the luminosity correlation (5) . The strength of 
the correlation could not have been predicted, however. Treating 
the upper limits as detections, the Spearman rank correlation 
coefficient is -o. 5q, significant to 0. 05% . 
There is considerable scatter, galaxies with the same 
rotation parameter differing in surface brightness by up to a 
factor ten. 
A quick investigation shows that such galaxies 
differ in colour too, an indication that second parameter effects 
may be operative. The overall distribution suggests the presence 
of a lower envelope. 
2 . 2  The Second Parameter Corrected Correlation 
We undertook a second parameter analysis of the sample by 
investigating the deviations from the (b-V) , M correlation mean 

382 
R. F. G. WYSE AND B. J. T. JONES 
line (colours from ref (9) )  and from the velocity dispersion, M 
mean line. 'l'he log a and (b-V) residuals are indeed correlated, 
allowing a second parameter corrected velocity dispersion to be 
defined (see ref (3) for discussion of the second parameter 
correction procedure) . 
34 galaxies have colours and hence 
corrected dispersions. Figure 2 shows the (v/a)*, surface 
brightness plots for this sample - 2(a) shows raw (v/a )*; 2(b) 
shows the relation using corrected dispersions. 
'l'here is an 
improvement in the correlation, the regression coefficient 
increasing from -0.53 to -0. 58. The major feature of the plot 
remains a lower envelope. Here and in Figure 1 the envelope 
corresponds to 
(v/a)* a Surface brightness 
= L/r2 
There is no a priori reason why points should not fall in 
the region below this envelope, unless constrained by real 
physical effects due to the galaxy formation process. 
Hence this 
envelope tells us about how ellipticals formed. 
(Note that since 
the envelope falls on the high surface brightness limit, it 
should not be the result of a simple bias in the observations; 
spurious constant surface brightness correlations have been 
discussed in (10) ) .  
One might think that the trends shown in Figures 1 and 2 
could be due to inclination effects - as an oblate galaxy is 
viewed in an increasingly pole-on orientation, its surface 
brightness and apparent rotation velocity both decrease - the 
overall trend of the envelope. Here however, the plots refer not 
simply to v/a but to the shape-normalised quantity (v/a)*, which 
varies in a complicated way with inclination. Binney (11) has 
shown that for oblate galaxies, (v/a)* at an edge-on orientation 
is the minimum possible. The largest increase in (v/a )* as the 
galaxy is tilted towards face-on orientations is for anisotropic, 
intrinsically rather flat galaxies, though even isotropic 
f lattened galaxies (around ES) can be observed to have 
(v/a)* > 1.4. (Note that anisotropic galaxies increase (v/a )* 
towards unity, while isotropic galaxies increase (v/a )* above 
unity. )  Thus, since the surface brightness is a maximum in the 
edge-on orientation, projection effects will cause a scatter 
roughly perpendicular to the lower envelope in Figures 1 and 2, 
and cannot produce the correlation; the envelope slope represents 
the inherent (edge-on) correlation. This lower envelope is not 
obvious in the luminosity : (v/a)* plane, and it is less easy to 
isolate the effects of inclination uncertainties on this latter 
distribution. 
Evidence that the spread is at least in part due to 
inclination comes from noticing that the distribution of 
(observed) ellipticity on the (v/a)* plane is non-uniform. 

ROTATION, DISSIPATION AND ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES 
383 
There is a tendency to find the rounder galaxies in the top right 
hand quadrant of the plane, and only galaxies observed flatter 
than E2 . 5  along the lower envelope. 
The crucial point is the 
lack of round ellipticals along and near to the lower envelope 
where we would predict the edge-on galaxies should lie. 
The 
triangular shape of the distribution is partly due to the fact 
that projection effects favour (v/cr)* unity, and environmental 
effects discussed below. 
3 THEORETICAL MODELS 
3. 1 Existing Theories 
The slope of the lower envelope can be used to test galaxy 
formation theories, in a manner analogous to ref (5) . 
It has been proposed (12 ,  13) that normal ellipticals formed 
from the merger of stellar disc galaxies. Most simulations of the 
merging process have simplified the situation to identical 
elliptical building blocks (14 and refs within) . 
Simple energy 
conservation arguments indicate that the merger remnant will have 
mean surface brightness within the half mass (light) radius 
decreased by a factor two from the progenitors. 
Neglecting the 
orbital contribution, assuming random orientations of progenitor 
spin axes suggest that (v/cr) for the remnant will be a factor 
N-3/2 smaller than that for each of the N progenitors. Thus the 
s implest merger theory using small elliptical building blocks 
would predict a slope 0. 70 for the rotation, surface brightness 
correlation. This is reasonably close to the observed (v/cr )* 
relation, but there is the added complication of the essentially 
unknown ellipticity distribution expected in the merger remnants, 
which depends rather crucially on the assumed initial orbital 
parameters. In any case this simple merger model faces 
difficulties with the observed luminosity-velocity dispersion 
relation. 
A picture with spiral building blocks faces the 
immediate problem that the surface density of the progenitors is 
already lower than observed ellipticals . 
The dissipationless formation of ellipticals in a clustering 
hierarchy does not produce nearly a strong enough dependence of 
rotation on mass, or a high enough amplitude (5) . 
The occurence 
of dissipation leads to more scaling relations than free 
parameters and allows a consistency check of the theoretical 
predictions against the observations (c . f .  ref 5) . 
Using the 
slope of the envelope of the surface brightness - rotation 
correlation, we find that the slopes cannot easily be made 
consistent (see ref (15) ) .  
The rotational properties of galaxies formed in dissipative

pancake and blast wave scenarios have not yet been inve st igated 
i n  suf ficient detail to be cons trained strongly , but a simple 
suggestion that the ini t ial turbulence is independent o f  scale 
( 1 8) seems incons is tent with the envelope slope . 
3 . 2  A Simple Model 
The underlying key to the problem is evidently the role 
p layed by dissipation of random energies in the rotat ion plane , 
i n  the gas that formed the luminous material, s ince this 
i ncreases both the surf ace brightness an<l the impor tance of 
rotational velocities, and also modi f ies the chemi s t ry and s tar 
f ormation rates wi thin the proto galaxy . 
From Figure s  1 an<l 2 ,  
high surf ace brigh tness , rotat ing ellipt icals - whi ch are also 
low luminos i ty ellipt icals - diss ipated more than their high 
luminos ity counterparts. 
The idea that disc galaxies formed from gas whi ch col lapsed 
in a dark halo potential is fairly well established (refs (17) , 
( 18) & (19) ) .  
Simplicity arguments suggest that ellipt icals 
formed in the same way . 
Unfortunately , the most s traigh t forward 
extension of diss ipative col lapse in a hierarchy of haloes has 
b een shown to face severe problems in explaining the exi s tence of 
s low rotation in ellipticals which have large collapse fac tors 
( small e ffective radii) compared to disc galaxies of the same 
luminosity .  
However, the presence of a dark halo introduc es 
another parameter into the problem - the fract ion of gas 
i ni tially present in the perturbat ion. 
Th e square root of thi s 
appears as a mult iplicitive factor in the expression for the 
f inal rotation velocity : velocity 
dispersion rat io in terms of 
the collapse fac tor (ref 20) . 
The frac tion of gas present is not 
l ikely to remain cons tant once galaxy formation commences , even 
though s imp l ic i ty arguments may favour a universal value at the 
earliest epochs. A variable frac t ion of gas can explain the 
increas ing importance of a pres sure supported component (19) . 
We favour a scheme in which lower mass sys t ems remain 
predominantly gaseous longer. 
In our model, the luminous 
components of ellipt icals form from gas col lapsing in the 
potential wel ls of aspherical <lark haloes (c . f .  (17) an<l ( 1 9) ) .  
The asphericity of the potent ial resul ts in a pref erent ial 
collapse axi s ( t he shortest) allowing shock heat ing , c ompression 
and cool ing of gas to occur before much collapse has yet occured 
in the other directions . 
St ars formed in this ini t ial collapse 
phase come from gas which has not diss ipated its energy in the 
rotat ion plane. 
Stars formed after violent relaxation of the 
potential wil l  be more rotationally supported . 
Thus the rotat ion 
parameter obs erved for a galaxy deperyds on the relative amounts 
of stars formed prior to an<l after relaxation of the potential. 
There exi s t s  a critical shock temperature and hence infall height

from which gas can cool rapidly . 
The rat io of cool ing to 
collapse t ime s is governed principally by the gas frac t ion, with 
contributions from the asphericity and dens ity profile of the 
d ark halo. 
The trends of Figures 1 and 2 then reflect a s equence 
o f  ini t ial gas fraction - lower surface brightness (h igher 
lumnos ity) ellipt icals form from perturbations with a higher 
initial gas frac t ion, and have a lower mass to l ight rat io. 
Pe rturbat ions destined to form higher surface brightness , lower 
luminosity ellipt icals contain a smaller fraction of gas , at 
l ower dens i ties . 
The assumpt ion of a s imple scaling relationship between the 
gas frac t ion and the init ial perturbat ion mas s ,  with index K ,  
allows an e s t imat e  of K to be made from consistency requirement s .  
Define n as the power spectrum slope for the hierarchy of halo 
d ensity perturbat ions . 
Fo r n in the range compatible with galaxy 
c o rrelation func t ion observations (ref 7) we f ind that K= 0 . 2 5  
( n=O ) ;  
K 
= 0 . 0 5  (n=-1 . 5) .  
I t  i s  impor tant that K is constrained 
to po s i t ive values , s ince we envisage K pos i t ive in our models 
( higher luminosity ellipticals forming from higher mas s  
perturbations with a h igher init ial gas fraction) . 
The shape of the dist ribution in Figures 1 and 2 i s  then 
explained as fol lows. 
The lower enve lope result s  from a variable 
gas fraction. 
The spread away from the envelope is caused in 
part by observational errors ( the effective radius estimates are 
the mos t l ikely source of error) but mos t ly by pro jection 
e ff ec t s .  
The large spread in rotation paramet er for the lower 
s ur face brightness galaxies can be explained as a real physical 
e ffect - t he low surface brigh tness galaxies whi ch have a high 
rotation parameter tend to be the dominant member of groups of 
galaxie s ,  and so are perhaps stationary with respect to the group 
po tential well. 
Th is aids accre t ion of intergalac tic gas , and 
i nhibi ts dynami cal removal o f  gas in the early phases o f  galaxy 
f o rma t ion. 
Th e fac t that en galaxies rotate slowly perhaps 
argues aga inst the plaus ibility of thi s explainat ion, but ens are 
a typical ellipt icals. 
The dist inguishing features between spi rals and ellipticals 
then arise from both nature and nurture . 
Tb e increased 
predominance of a centrifugally supported component resul t s  from 
init ial condit ions of lower gas fract ion and decreas ing 
a sphericity of the halo potent ial. 
A cold, gas disc is a 
s econdary struc ture, formed by ejecta from the pressure supported 
component , and gas only now cooling . 
Hi gh dens ity envi ronment s ,  
a s  favoured by pre sent day ellipticals , (ref s (21) and (22) ) can 
l ead to dynami cal removal of gas in the oute r  regions of the 
initial per turba tion, result ing in no rotationally supported 
s tellar sys tem. 
Th is is because this out ly ing gas is shock 
heated to highest temp eratures during the collapse and hence is

destined to cool and form stars only after the relaxation is 
completed. Continuing gas removal inhihits secondary disc 
formation. It is also likely that in proto-ellipticals the 
angular momentum axis induced by tidal torques by nearest 
neighbours is not generally perfectly aligned with the principal 
plane of the potential. This leads to an additional thickening 
of the relaxed stellar system (c. f .  ref (23) ) and can explain the 
observation that there exist no ɕllipticals as flattened as disc 
galaxies.

CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF GALAXIES 


NUCLEOSYNTHESIS CONSTRAINTS ON EARLY GALACTIC EVOLUTION

This paper identifies abundance patterns observed in metal­
deficient stars which serve to distinguish them from stars of 
solar composition and reviews the defining characteristics of 
the nucleosynthesis mechanisms which are believed to be respon­
sible for their formation. We then seek to identify constraints 
that these combined observational and theoretical considerations 
impose upon models of the early history and evolution of our 
galaxy and cosmology.

INTRODUCTION 
Studies of chemical evolution quite generally seek to account 
for the distribution of abundances of the elements observed in 
the stars and interstellar gas in galaxies. The details of such 
studies have been reviewed quite extensively by Audouze and 
Tinsley (1976) and Tinsley (1980) and will not be elaborated 
here. 
There are a variety of factors which must necessarily en­
ter into any considerations of the early chemical evolution of 
the galaxy. In particular, it is necessary to provide some mea­
sure of the rate of star formation at early times (relative to 
dynamic timescales) , of the fraction of gas processed through 
early stellar generations , of the initial mass function of the 
first stellar generations , of the evolutionary characteristics 
of metal-deficient stars , and of the consequences of nucleosyn­
thesis in metal-poor stars. 
Such factors may strongly influence 
the relative abundances of heavy elements produced in early gen­
erations of stars. In turn, scrutiny of the abundance patterns 
observed in metal-deficient stars can allow inferences to be 
drawn concerning, and constraints to be imposed upon, the char-

acteristics of early stellar generations. 
My aim in this paper will be to identify such constraints as 
studies of this nature can impose upon the early evolutionary 
history of our galaxy and upon cosmology. 
In the following 
section ,  we identify groups of elements which are believed to 
have common origins in astrophysical environments ,  review the 
distinguishing characteristics of the nuclear processes which 
are assumed to be responsible for their formation, and summarize 
existing observations of the abundances of these elements in the 
most metal-deficient (and thus, presumably; the oldest) stars in 
our galaxy. 
Significant abundance patterns and trends are then 
discussed and possible implications for the early history of 
stellar activity in our galaxy are noted. 
2 .  NUCLEOSYNTHESIS PROCESSES AND ELEMENT ABUNDANCES 
Our aim in this paper is to identify constraints on the early 
evolutionary history of our galaxy which are imposed by observa­
tions of abundance patterns in metal-deficient stars . 
In order 
to provide a framework within which such observations may be in­
terpreted , we first present , in this section, a review of the 
basic mechanisms of nucleosynthesis ( see also Arnett ,  1973 ; 
Truran, 1973; Trimble , 1975) which calls attention to critical 
dependences upon the characteristics of the underlying stellar 
or supernova environments .  A brief survey of significant abun­
dance trends in metal-deficient stars, involving the products of 
specific nucleosynthsis processes , is also included . In these 
discussions , we will distinguish specific classes of heavy ele­
ments with common nucleosynthesis histories . 
2 . 1 .  The Light Elements H, He , Li , Be, and B 
The nuclei H, D, 3He , 4He , and 7Li constitute the expected pro­
ducts of nucleosynthesis accompanying the cosmological big bang , 
as is discussed in other contributions to these proceedings. 
The relative concentrations of these various constituents are of 
course dependent upon the conditions prevailing in the early 
universe , and observations can be utilized to impose constraints 
on cosmology. The abundances of H and 4He in the halo stars are 
compatible with this model . The situations for 3He and 7Li are 
complicated by the fact that these nuclei can be both formed and 
destroyed in different stellar environments. 
The observed abundances of 6Li , 9Be , lOB ,  and 1 1B are consistent 
with the view that they have been formed by the interactions of 
cosmic rays with the constituents of the interstellar medium 
over the history of the galaxy (see the review by Reeves et al , 
1973) . The production of sufficient concentrations of the-domi-

393 
nant isotope of lithium , 7Li , does not occur in this environ­
ment . Alternative possible sites for 71i synthesis include the 
cosmological big bang , supermassive stars , red giant stars , and 
novae. Unanswered questions associated with the detailed opera­
tion of these mechanisms and with the exten9 of 7Li destruction 
in stellar envelopes render predictions of Li synthesis rather 
uncertain. 
The abundance of lithium in unevolved halo stars has recently 
been determined by Spite and Spite ( 1982a ,b) . 
They deduce a 
pr̰mordial value for the abundance of lithium of N1i/NH = 11 .2 x 
10 1 1 
This result clearly has important implications for cos­
mology and thus for the composition of the gas out of which the 
galaxy formed. The substantial uncertainties associate with 
theoretical predictions of lithium formation (and destruction) 
in stars unfortunately limit the effectiveness of the use of 
lithium as a probe of early galactic evolution. 
2 .2 .  The Elements Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen 
12c and l6o represent the primary products of helium burning in 
stars. There is some indication (Arnett , 1978; Weaver ,  Zimmer­
man and Woosley, 1978) that the 16o; 12c ratio characterizing 
matter processed through massive stars is high relative to that 
of solar system matter. Intermediate mass stars may alterna­
tively provide the source of 12c neces$ary to meet galactic re­
quirements (Iben and Truran , 1978) . 
14N is formed as a bypro­
duct of CNO-cycle hydrogen burning. This is thought to occur in 
the hydrogen burning shells of red giant stars where the 14N 
thus formed can subsequently be transported to the surface by 
convection and enrich the interstellar medium as a consequence 
of mass loss or planetary nebula ejection. In genera14 all pri­
mordial CNO nuclei in the shell will be converted to 1 N due to 
these burning sequences :  the 14N thus formed therefore repre- . 
sents a secondary nucleosynthesis product . The formation of 
substantial 14N in first generation ( zero metal) stars would de­
mand some mixing of the products of shell helium burning into 
the overlying hydrogen shell during the course of red giant evo­
lution (Truran and Cameron , 1971 ;  Iben and Truran, 1978; Renzini 
and Voli , 198 1 ) , thus in essence forming nitrogen as a primary 
nucleosynthesis product . 
Trends in CNO abundances have been reviewed most recently by 
Tinsley (1979) . 
She argued that the high [O/Fe] ratios charac­
terizing halo stars were generally compatible with the site of 
origin being massive stars (Arnett , 1978; Weaver ,  Zimmerman and 
Woosley , 1978) . High O/Fe ratios are also observed in globular 
cluster stars (Pilachowski , Sneden, and Wallerstein, 1983) . 
The 
situation for carbon reveals [ C/Fe] 
 0 even for very iron­
deficient stars. 
This is consistent with the view that much of 

394 
J. W. TRURAN 
the carbon comes from less massive stars than those which pro­
duce oxygen : presumably intermediate mass stars ( Iben and 
Truran , 1978) . 
Unfortunately , the available data on nitrogen in 
extreme metal-deficient stars is not sufficient to allow any 
existing abundance trends to be clearly identified .  There is 
considerable variation in values determined for halo dwarfs and 
for stars at the same point in the color-magnitude diagram for 
globular clusters , and trends in C and N abundances can be 
complicated (see , for example , Kraft , 1979 ; Freeman and Norris , 
1981) . 
2.3. The Elements Neon to Nickel 
It is generally agreed that most isotopes in the mass range 20 < 
A Ƈ 60 represent products of explosive nucleosynthesis (Arnett 
1973; Truran 1973) . 
Successive exoergic stages of burning of 
hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, and silicon fuels define the 
presupernova evolution of massive stars . When the ashes of 
these burning epochs are subsequently subj ected to high tempera­
tures and densities accompanying their ejection in supernova 
events , further thermonuclear processing yields elemental iso­
topic abundance patterns resembling those of solar system mat­
ter . The products of these explosive burning processes are both 
temperature and composition dependent . 
Explosive carbon and 
oxygen burning at temperatures 2 x 109  T Ń 3 .6 x 109 K form 
nuclei in the mass range 20  A   44 , while the burning of car­
bon , oxygen or silicon fuels at temperatures 4 x 109  T Ń 6 x 
109 K produces nuclei in the iron peak 48  A   62 . 
The rela­
tive contributions will clearly be somewhat dependent upon the 
temperature-density structure of the presupernova star so that 
the ej ecta of supernova of differing masses (or stellar popula­
tions) may be expected to differ in their relative concentra­
tions of , for example , Ne , Mg , Si , S ,  Ar , Ca and Fe. 
Further­
more , calculations indicate that , for metal-poor stars , the re­
sulting concentrations both of odd-Z nuclei and of the neutron­
rich isotopes of even-Z nuclei may be significantly reduced 
( Truran and Arnett , 1971) ; some odd-even effects in Z may thus 
be expected for extremely metal-deficient stars . 
Perhaps the most complete and systematic survey of element abun­
dances in halo population stars is that provided by the ongoing 
study of extremely metal-deficient red giants by Luck and Bond 
(1981; 1983) . 
Their published results for a sample of 21 metal 
poor stars with derived [ Fe/HJ ratios ranging from -1 .4 to -2 .7 
reveal several interesting trends . 
The elements Mg , Si , Ca, and 
Ti are generally found to be enriched by roughly O .S dex rela­
tive to Fe in red giants with [Fe/HJ < -2. 
Moreover , the ratio 
[ Ni/Fe) is found to rise approximately linearly, from 0 to +l , 
over the range in [Fe/HJ from -2 to -3. 
For Fe concentrations 
[ Fe/HJ ɡ -2 , the relative abundances of Mg , Si , Ca , Ti , Fe and 

NUCLEOSYNTHESIS CONSTRAINTS ON EARLY GALACTIC EVOLUTION 
395 
Ni are all compatible with those of solar system matter . 
The 
data may also possibly suggest the existence of a mild odd-even 
effect , in the sense that elements containing odd numbers of 
protons show somewhat greater deficiencies at given [ Fe/HJ , but 
the uncertainties are such that a definite trend is not es­
tablished. 
Interestingly ,  Pilachowski , Sneden and Wallerstein 
(1983) have studied a sample of globular clusters with derived 
[ Fe/HJ ratios ranging from -0 .9 to -2 .2 and found trends similar 
to those characteristic of halo stars : 
the elements Mg ,  Si , Ca 
and Ti are enriched relative to Fe by approximately 0 .5 dex. 
Note that all of these abundance variations involve elements 
which are the expected products of a single nucleosynthesis 
mechanism : 
explosive charged-particle nucleosynthesis in super­
nova environments. Perhaps the most straightforward possible 
interpretation is that the trends in [Mg ,  Si , Ca ,  and Ti/Fe] 
reflect differences in the density structures of the progenitor 
stars of supernova of Population II. 
The situation ,  unfortu­
nately, is more complicated. One can argue alteratively (Luck 
and Bond , 1981) that massive stars preferentially synthesized 
Mg , Si , Ca , and Ti relative to Fe early in the history of the 
galaxy and that an independent source of iron was later provided 
when intermediate-mass progenitors of ( Type I) supernovae ap­
peared . 
This alternative interpretation , involving two stellar 
or supernova sources of Fe , necessarily introduces dependences 
on the structure and time dependence of the initial mass func­
tion and upon the rate and efficiency of star formation early in 
the galaxy ' s  history. The problem is further complicated by the 
fact that , since the formation of iron peak nuclei in massive 
stars occurs in the innermost regions ejected from the vicinity 
of the neutronized core , predictions of the relative abundances 
of iron in supernova ej ecta are sensitive to details of super­
nova hydrodynamic models and are therefore quite uncertain. 
2 . 4 .  The Heavy Elements 
Elements beyond the iron abundance peak (A ) 60) are formed in 
nature primarily by means of neutron capture processes . 
The ob­
served abundance patterns in the heavy element region indicate 
that at least two distinct neutron fluxes have contributed . 
De­
pending upon whether the characteristic lifetimes against neu­
tron capture are longer than ( s-process) or shorter than ( r­
process) those for beta decay ,-the resulting neutron capture 
path and therefore the nuclei formed by these reaction sequences 
can differ dramatically. 
Typically , the r-process capture path 
lies off the valley of beta stability and-gives rise to the pro­
duction of more neutron-rich isotopes of heavy elements while 
the s-process forms isotopes which lie on or near the valley of 
beta-stability. The problem of distinguishing s-process and r­
process patterns in stars is complicated by the-facts that : "(1) 

396 
J. W. TRURAN 
most heavy elements receive contributions from both s-process 
and r-process nucleosynthesis; (2) there exist only -;- few ele­
ment"S, like europium , which are formed primari ly by the r­
process; and (3) the generation of neutron fluxes compat ible 
with s-process nucleosynthesis in different stellar environments 
can give rise to distinctly different abundance patterns ( Truran , 
1980 ; Ulrich , 1982) . 
Data regarding heavy element abundances in metal deficient stars 
has recently been provided by several authors (Peterson , 1976; 
Spite and Spite , 1978 ; Luck and Bond , 1981; Sneden and Partha­
sarathy, 1983) . 
The data confirms the existence of depletions 
in the abundances of the designated s-process elements Sr , Y ,  
Zr , Ba , La, and Ce relative to iron in stars of low Fe/H; in 
particular , these trends are evident for [Fe/H] څ -1.5 . 
The ex­
istence of systematic differential or aging effects in abundance 
trends , first emphasized by Pagel (1968) and more recently re­
viewed by Tinsley ( 1979) and others , is substantially confirmed 
for Sr and Ba. Luck and Bond (1981) note a strong aging trend 
in Ba, with [ Ba/Fe] rising from -1.6 in the most iron-deficient 
giants to approximately zero at [Fe/H] 

 -2 .0 to -1 . 5 ;  Y and Zr 
are found to behave similarly, but with somewhat lower relative 
depletions . 
At first glance , the interpretation of these trends as reflect­
ing the secondary character of the ù-process of nucleosynthesis 
seems straightforward : 
the abundance levels of the heavy ele­
ments lag behind that of Fe during the early history since pri­
mordial Fe concentrations are demanded in the stars in which the 
s-process nuclei are formed. 
This would suggest that the stars 
in which we see heavy elements are very likely third generation 
obj ects - first generation (pure hydrogen and helium) stars 
formed iron while second generation stars processed iron to hea­
vy elements - and perhaps strengthens arguments for the exist­
ence of a Population III . 
This straightforward interpretation 
nevertheless has problems . 
Tinsley ( 1979) called attention to 
the fact that the observed trends in [Y/Fe] and [ Ba/Fe] with 
[Fe/H] are not consistent with the theoretical behavior pre­
dicted for secondary elements .  While it is possible to generate 
ad hoc assumptions which allow these observational trends in s­
process abundance formally to be understood , such attempts to 
date have not been entirely satisfactory. 
Truran (1981) proposed an alternative interpretation of these 
abundance trends as being due to the fact that the heavy element 
abundances in extreme metal-deficient stars are , rather , pro­
ducts of r-process nucleosynthesis . 
This view is suggested by 
the observations of Spite and Spite (1978) that the abundance of 
europium (an element whose abundance in nature is due primarily 
to .E_-process nucleosynthesis) relative to iron is essent ially 

NUCLEOSYNTHESIS CONSTRAINTS ON EARLY GALACTIC EVOLUTION 
solar even for stars of [Fe/H] 
- -2 .6. The determination by 
Luck and Bond ( 1983) that the pronounced "aging effects" ob­
served for Ba and Sr are not evident for Nd , La , Ce and Pr is 
also consistent with the _£-process model . 
397 
While questions remain concerning the character and origin of 
the heavy element abundances in metal-deficient stars , the util­
ity of these abundance trends as probes of the rates of star 
formation and nucleosynthesis during the early history of the 
galaxy is greatly restricted . 
3 .  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
We wish now to consider whether the distinctive abundance trends 
observed in metal-deficient stars impose interesting constraints 
on the character of the earliest stages of galactic evolution. 
The significant abundance trends that have been identified may 
be summarized as follows : 
( 1 )  the ratio [O/Fe] is high ( - O.S) 
for extreme halo stars while [ C/Fe] 
 O; (2) values of [Mg/Fe] , 
[ Si/Fe] , [ Ca/Fe] , [ Ti/Fe] , and [ Ni/Fe] of 
- 0 .5 characterize 
stars for which [ Fe/H] ų -2; ( 3) systematic depletions of the s­
process elements Sr , Y, and particularly Ba, relative to iron ,ƈ 
are observed for stars of [ Fe/He] ų -1 .S ; (4) the r-process ele­
ment europium is present in solar proportions relative to iron 
in extremely metal-deficient stars . 
Of these ,  the systematic 
overabundances of 0, Mg , Si , Ca, and Ti relative to Fe are con­
sistent with the predictions of models of supernovae involving 
massive stars (Arnett ,  1978; Weaver , Zimmerman and Woosley , 
1978) . 
If we adopt Tinsley ' s  (1979) assumption of a second 
source of iron, we can understand the subsequent approach of 
these ratios to their solar values as the lower mass stars which 
form iron evolve on longer timescales. The fact that [ C/Fe] re­
mains compatible with solar even for the oldest stars suggests 
that the source of carbon, like that of iron in Tinsley ' s  model , 
may again be low or intermediate mass stars . 
The trends in ù-process elements are of particular interest 
here . 
As we have noted previously , the presence of Ɖ-process 
nuclei in stars of metal concentrations as low as [Fe/H] 
= -2 .6 
alone holds implications for galactic evolution. The simplest 
interpretation of these as secondary elements implies that the 
matter we are seeing in these stars has been processed through 
at least two prior stellar environments. This might reasonably 
be viewed as supporting evidence for the existence of a "Popula­
tion III . "  The alternative interpretation of these abundances 
as produces of r-process nucleosynthesis (Truran , 1981) imposes 
less severe demands on early galactic evolution. In principle , 
the formation of r-process nuclei can occur in a first genera-

398 
J. W. TRURAN 
tion , zero metal star : 
the existence of primordial concentra­
tions of seed Fe nuclei is not absolutely demanded . 
It is important to emphasize that it is the timescale of element 
formation which is the critical factor. If it were possible to 
identify a nucleosynthesis product of the evolution of very low 
mass stars whose lifetimes far exceeded the dynamic timescale of 
the galactic halo , then a clear need for a distinct prior stel­
lar generation might be established. 
Alternatively, the identi­
fication of significant concentrations of secondary elements ,  
whose presence in metal deficient stars demands that the matter 
has been processed sequentially through two previous stars , 
would impose severe restrictions as well . 
In this regard, the 
fact that the Sr and Ba concentrations in metal deficient stars 
can be interpreted alternatively as primary ( r-process) ele­
ments ,  reduces their usefulness as probes of -early galactic evo­
lution. Increased and improved data regarding nitrogen in metal 
deficient stars could also prove extremely important , although 
here again both primary and secondary production of nitrogen is 
possible (Truran and Cameron , 1971; Iben and Truran , 1978) . 
In order to place this problem in perspective, it may be in­
structive to call attention to the fact that the observed abun­
dance patterns in the most extreme metal-deficient stars can all 
be interpreted as involving primary elements which can be formed 
in massive stars of short lifetimes in the very earliest stages 
of galactic history. 
In particular , the published results of 
Arnett ( 1978) for stars in the range 35-50 Me ( core masses 16-24 
̯) give approximately the following ratios : 
[ C/Fe) 
 0 ,  
[ O/Fe) 
- 0 . 5 , and [ ( Ne + Mg + Si/Fe] 
- 0 .5 .  The site of r­
process nucleosynthesis has not yet been firmly established. 
I f  
we further assume the r-process to occur in these massive stars , 
associated with the expansion and ejection of highly neutronized 
matter from the outer extremities of the core , the observed ra­
tio [ Eu/Fe) 
- 0 ,  [ Sr /Fe) 
- -0 .5 and [ Ba/Fe) 
- -1 can also be 
understood ( Truran, 1981) . 
Thus , virtually every feature of the 
seemingly anomalous abundance patterns characterizing extreme 
metal-deficient stars can result from nuclear process occurring 
in a single , "first generation," massive star. Note also that a 
single such massive star ej ecting 10 Me or more of heavy ele­
ments can contaminate 106 Me of gas to a level [ Fe/H] 
- -3 . 
This may be relevant both to questions concerning the source of 
the abundances of heavy elements in globular cluster stars and 
to the fact that globular cluster stars exhibit very similar 
abundance patterns to those of extreme halo population stars .

Summary 
The observational properties ( fractionary mass of gas , metallicity 
and colours ) of a sample of dwarf irregular and magellanic type 
galaxies are discussed in the light of the stochastic self propa­
gating star formation model of Gerola et al . ( 1 980 ) . To this aim , 
one-zone model galaxies are presented which take into account both 
the bursting mode of star formation and infall of unenriched gas . 
The comparison with the observational data shows that the high 
dispersion in the properties of these galaxies cannot be explained 
by the stochastic mechanism alone . 
Three possible ways out are 
indicated, namely variations in the metal yield , variations in the 
ratio of the star formation to mass accretion rates , and finally 
variations in the ratio of star formation to galactic wind rates . 
Introduction 
Dwarf irregular galaxies are a distinct class of obj ects , ranging 
from red low surface brightness to high brightnes s  blue compact 
systems . These latter are of particular interest , because they are 
characterized by the occurrence of very intense stellar activities 
at the present time , blue colours , high hydrogen contents and low 
metal abundances . However , a few obj ects like IZW 1 8  ( Lequeux and

Viallefond , 1980 ) and IZW 36 ( Viallefond and Thuan , 1 98 2 )  seem not 
to obey the above schemat i zation , as they posses both low metalli­
cities and low hydrogen to total mass ratios at the same time . 
As already suggested by Searle et al . ( 1 973 ) ,  these galaxies are 
likely to suffer from sporadic episodes of strong stellar activity , 
as continuous star formation all over the galaxy life at the pre­
sent rate , would completely exhaust their gas and overproduce me­
tals , 
Although the nature of the physical process causing the burst 
of star formation is not yet clear , current theoreti cal understan­
ding of this phenomenon indicates that both dynamical stimulation 
in interacting systems ( Larson and Tinsley , 1 978 ) and/or the sto­
chasti c  self propagating mechanism of Gerola et al . ( 1 980 ) in 
gene­
ral are good candidates . In this paper , we discuss the main proper­
t ies of a selected sample of irregular galaxies ( blue compact and 
magellanic irregulars )  in the light of Gerola ' s  et al . ( 1 980 ) theo­
ry , because it naturally provides the bursting mode of stellar 
activity in systems of relatively small size. In particular , we 
derive the gas content , the chemical abundances and colours of 
model galaxies with a different number of bursts of star formation 
and compare them w.ith the observational data . 
1 .  The Observational Material 
Basic properties for some 45 galaxies have been collected from va­
rious sources in the literature . These are reported in Table 1 ,  
which displays in columns the galaxy identification with references 
( 1 )  and ( 2 )  respectively , the distance in Mpc , ( 3 ) , the (U-B )  and 
( B-V ) colours , ( 4 )  and ( 5 ) , the total mass MT in solar units , ( 6 ) , 
the gas mass M 
in solar units ,  ( / ) , the gas to total mass ratio , 
g 
( 8 ) , the mean metal abundance Z ,  ( 9 ) ,  the Holmberg diameter , ( 1 0 ) , 
which i s  taken here 
as size indicator . Thi s  sample i s  quite inho­
mogeneous in terms of galaxy morphology and quality of the data . 
In particular , 
masses and distances are reported as given in the 
original sources but all scaled to the same Hubble constant of 
1 00 Km/ sec/ Mpc . Furthermore , the gas mass determined from the

2 1  cm line data is uncertain by the contribution of molecular hy­
drogen , a quantity which very difficult to determine , whereas the 
total mass ,  with the exception of the few cases for which both 
21 cm line maps and rotation curves exist , is derived from the 
indicative mass of Fisher and Tully ( 1 975 ) .  The gas mass M 
is 1 . 3

to take He into account ( Lequeux et al . 1 979 ) .  The metallicity Z 
is obtained from the ratio N ( O ) /N ( H )  with the aid of the relation 
Log Z = 1 . 42 + Log N( O ) /N ( H )  due to Lequeux et al . ( 1 979 ) . The 
oxygen to hydrogen ratios used to derive Z are as given in the ori­
ginal sources and no attempt is made to make them uniform as far as 
the derivation method is concerned. In the following , we will brie­
fly discuss some of the observational properties that are relevant 
to subsequent model construction :

lation found by Lequeux et al . ( 1 979 ) for a less numerous sample of 
galaxies . A distinct feature of this diagram is that our galaxies 
seem to evenly populate the region below the line of Lequeux et al . 
( 1 979 ) ,  which c orresponds to Z 
= 0 . 004 ln MT/Mg of the simple clo­
sed model . It is soon evident that unless the scatter is entirely 
attributable to observational unc ertainties , the s imple closed 
model cannot account for the distribution of our galaxies in the 
Z vs Log Mg/MT plane . It is however worth recalling that MT is 
uncertain by a factor of about four , whereas no straightforward 
estimate of the uncertainty in M 
and Z can be given . 
g 
i i ) The rate of star formation 
Observational determinations of the rate of star formation in these 
galaxies are difficult to obtain . The luminosity to total mass 
ratio , L /MT , which i s  a measure of the intensity of the stellar 
activity , turns out to be much greater in compact galaxies than in 
irregular galaxies ( > 1 compared to 0 . 2  to 0 . 3 L8/M9 , .Searle and 
Sargent , 1 972 ; Lequeux et al . ,  1 979 ) .  Furthermore ,  the rate of star 
formation per unit mas s  of gas ( normalized to the solar vicinity 
value and expressed by the ratio of the number of massive stars to 
the mass of hydrogen ) is seen to vary from 1 to 0 . 03 ( Lequeux , 
1 979a ) , and to be anticorrelated to the average volume density of 
gas ( hydrogen ) contrary to the expectation from the Schmidt ' s  
law 
of 
star 
formation .  
In addition 
to thi s ,  the recent stu­
dies of Hunter ( 1 982 ) and Hunter et al . ( 1 982 ) indicate that the 
rate of star formation in these galaxies can be much higher than 
the local galactic value ( up to 1 03 times ) ,  and that no correlation 
exi sts with global gas and/or abundance parameters . They also point 
out that the fractional involvement of the galaxy in the present 
star forming activity decreases with increasing rate of star forma­
t ion and decreasing time scale of gas consumption .  Finally , Hunter 
( 1 982 ) finds that distinct cells of stellar activity can be isola­
ted whose typical size i s  of the order of 1 00 - 400 )lc . Noteworthy , 
the occurrence of star formation in cells is compatible with the 
stochasti c  star formation process of Gerola et al . ( 1 980 ) .  As a 

406 
C. CHIOSI AND F. MATTEUCCI 
last remark , Hunter ' s  ( 1 982 ) data suggest that the process of star 
formation in irregular galaxies i s  not entirely random , but a glo­
bal mechanism is likely to exi st which regulates star formation 
with time . 
iii ) Evidence of Infall 
Extensive HI observations have indicated that blue compact and irre­
gular galaxies are surrounded by extended HI haloes , 
whose dimen­
sions are much greater than those of the optical structures ( Gordon 
and Gottesman , 1 98 1 , and references therein ) .  It has been suggested 
that the existenc e of such HI haloes could be taken as an evidence 
of primordial gas still collapsing on an already formed c entral 
structure . This view is compatible .with the theory of galaxy forma­
tion of Larson ( 1 977 ) , according to whom the slower i s  the collapse 
the later is the morphological type of the formed galaxy . 
2 .  Theoretical Models 
We present models of chemical evolution of irregular and c ompact 
galaxies , which incorporate the stochastic sel f  propagating star 
formation mechanism of Gerola et al . ( 1 980 ) , and as much as possi­
ble of the observational hints we have summarized in the foregoing 
section . We assume a single zone description and complete instanta­
neous mixing of gas . We also release the instantaneous recycling 
approximation , thus following in detail the time evolution of seve­
ral important elements 
( H ,  He , C+O , Si+Fe ) due to stellar nucleo­
synthesis , stellar mass ej ection and inflow of unenriched gas . The 
usual set of differential equations describes the t ime variation 
of the fractionary mass of gas G .  in form of a given element i :

is particularly suited for studies of chemical evolution as it can 
be related to the dynamical nature of the problem of galaxy forma­
tion . The fractions Q. ( t ,M )  incorporate the nucleosynthesis results 
l 
of Arnett ( 1 978 ) and Iben and Truran ( 1 978 ) for massive and inter-
mediate mass stars respectively . The stellar mass function is ex­
pressed as a power law of the mas s  
Ě ( M )  ɕM-x , where x may vary with 
the range of mass . The following normalisation condition is used

' being the fraction of the stellar mass function in stars more

B ( t ) 
=v n ( t )  G ( t ) 
( 4 )  
where 
n ( t )  represents the fraction of the system undergoing star 
formation at any given time , and it contains the bursting mode of 
the process as in Gerola ' s  et al . ( 1 980 ) numerical experiments .  
G ( t ) is the current fractionary mass of gas and it may reflect 
effects of infall or other global mechanisms . Finally 
v is an 
efficiency parameter to be fixed by the comparison with the obser­
vational dat a .  
To derive an estimate of the parameter v 
we make 
use of the properties of the Magellanic Clouds , for which a fluctua­
ting but never ceasing star formation rate is predicted by the 

408 
C. CHIOSI AND F. MATTEUCCI 
theory . We get v 
= 4 .  If the rate of star formation per unit mass 
of gas partic ipating to the star forming process , v , is an univer­
sal property of galaxies , we would expect that their 
major observa­
ble 
features ( Z  and Mg/MT ) can be obtained by varying only the 
number of bursts according to the galaxian size in the manner pre­
dicted by Gerola ' s  et al . ( 1 980 ) theory , while keeping v constant . 
The number of burst ranges from 1 to 20 when the size increases 
from 0 . 4  to 1 Kpc . 
3 .  Model Results 
An extensive grid of models has been 
calculated for different 
values of v , 
T 
and two choices for 
¢ ( M ) , namely the Salpeter 
( 1 9 5 5 )  mass function , x = 1 . 3 5 ,  and a two slope case with x = 1 . 3 5  
for M < 2 M8 and x 
= 2 above . This latter choice somehow takes into 
account the recent determination of Lequeux ( 1 919b ) . The two mass 
functions are thereinafter indicated by S and L respectively . 
Table 2 summarizes the characterizing parameters for each set of 
models calculated with different number of bursts . Fig . 2 shows

the fundamental relationship between 
Z and Log G .  
It is soon evident that 
this relation i s  mostly governed by 
the mass function through the parame­
ters x and ݚ 
, whereas a secondary 
role is played by v and T .  The latter 
in particular has little effect on 
model results ,  whereas the higher is 
v the lower is G and the higher i s  Z 
at any given time . As SMC and LMC are 
l ikely to be the best studied galaxies 
in our sample ,  we make use of their 
properti es ( Z and G )  to choose among the various models ,  and in 
consequence to fix v . It turns out that set C ( v 
4 )  matches the 
properties of SMC , whereas set D ( v 
= 1 0 )  those of LMC . The rate

i s  0 . 3  and 2 . 0  times the solar vicinity value . To the latter we 
assign the value of 0 . 7 5  1 0-9 yr- 1 on the basis of the estimate of 
Miller and Scalo ( 1 979 ) of the rate of star formation ,  and the 
estimate of Pagel and Patchett ( 1 975 ) of the surface mass density 
of gas . Let us examine now whether v has to be greater in LMC than 
SMC , or other explanations can be put forward . In fact , it is easy 
to understand that this finding would somewhat weaken the universa­
l ity of the stochastic mechanism , in that other physical processes 
should be invoked to justify the increase of v from SMC to LMC . 
An obvious way out of this difficulty i s  that the two galaxies have 
not the same chemical age , in the sense that star formation in SMC 
started much later than in LMC . If this is the cas e ,  an unique 
value of v is pos sible , as model D ,  which at the age of 1 2x 1 0'1 yr 
matches LMC , may even reproduce SMC when about 5x 1 09 yr old . Of 
course this does not mean that star formation could not occur in 
SMC at earlier epochs , but only that significant star formation 
started at relatively recent times . The study of Barbaro ( 1 982 ) , 
indicating that extremely few clusters older than 6x 1 09 yr seem to 
exi st in SMC , somehow supports this view .  In such a case , the pa­
rameter v 
assumes the value of 1 0 .  
Nevertheless , models D that 
are seen to reproduce the main features of LMC and SMC are apparen­
tly unable to account for the wide spread properties of the whole

sample of galaxies . In fact , the models independently of the number 
and intensity of the star forming events ,  are expected to be loca­
ted along a line in the Z vs Log G plane , fixed by the stellar mass 
function alone . Therefore , they cannot reproduce galaxies with the 
same Z but different Mg/MT at the same time . In the reasonable 
hypothesis that at least part of the scatter is real and not due 
to the sole uncertainty in the observational quantities , it i s  worth 
looking for plausible ways out of the difficulty encountered by 
our models . Thi s  is studied by means of the simple model of galactic 
evolution which is known to approximate fairly well this type of 
galaxies . 
a) Effect of the chemical yields 
Although compelling evidences are still missing , nevertheless the 
possibility that the stellar mas s function and at less extent the 
stellar nucleosynthetic processing , may vary from galaxy to galaxy 
cannot be excluded . This can be tested in terms of the global yield

models ( whereby the infall rate equals the star formation rat e )  for 
different values of Pz • In the case of the closed model , Pz should 
vary from 0 . 0004 to 0 . 004 to encompass the whole range of metalli­
cities . Similarly for the infall models .  
b ) Effect of Infall 
To analyse the effect of infall at different rates , we calculate 
models in which the rate of star formation is assumed to be propor­
tional to the infall rate . Denoting with s and f the rate of star 
formation and gas infall in the standard notation ( Tinsley , 1 980 ) , 
we assume f 
= ( 1 - R ) ɖ  A , where R is the return fraction per stellar 
generation and 
A is a free parameter . With this assumption , the 
usual system of equations describing the time variation of Z 
( Tinsley , 1 980 ) can be solved analytically . Solutions for several 
values of 
A and an unique value of 
Pz are shown in Fig . 4

The suggestion arises that the large scatter shown by our test 
galaxies may be due to the different importanc e of the star forma­
tion rate relative to the infall rate . In such a case the topology 
of Fig .  4 may give some indication of the parameter A for each 
individual ( or group of ) galaxy . 
c )  Effect of Galactic Winds 
Galactic winds energized by supernova explosions are likely to be 
a distinct feature of these galaxies as they are relatively loosely 
bound and they may occasionally suffer from 
very intense burst s  
of star formation . To explore the point , w e  as sume the rate of 
gas loss W to be proportional to the rate of star formation . 
According to the standard notation we write 
W = ( 1  
- R )  ͤ A , whe­
re A is a free parameter . With this assumption ,  the usual equations 
( Tinsley , 1 980 ) can be solved analytically . Fig .  5 shows these 
solutions for different values of A and an unique value of Pz ·

Although highly speculative , the results of Fig . 5 indicate that 
galactic winds may concur to determine the wide scatter in the 
observational data . 
4 .  Photometric Evolution 
In order to 
test whether our models galaxies reproduce the observed 
distribution in the (U-B ) vs ( B-V ) plane , integrated colours are 
calculated with the same method as in Searle et al . ( 1 973 ) ,  however 
adapted to incorporate more recent stellar models of massive stars . 
With the aid of burst ages and star formation rates of our numerical 
models , we derive the two colour plots shown in Fig . 6 .

The areas comprised

overall effect of bursts 
of different age and 
intensity , when 
applied 
to red , blue and very 
blue galaxies . These re­
sults agree with those of 
Searle et al . ( 2973 ) , 
Huchra ( 1 977 ) and Larson 
and Tinsley ( 1 978 ) . 
They however differ in 
the stellar mass function 
and definition of burst 
intensity . Here this 
quantity i s  defined as 
x = n ( t ) I < n ( t ) > . 
Although there is in 
general no unique set of 
burst parameters for a 
given point in the two­
colour plot , some limits 

414

can be derived . 
5 .  Conclusions 
In this paper we present models based on the stochastic self pro­
pagating star formation theory of Gerola et al . ( 1 980 ) ,  which are 
aimed to provide a guide l ine for a quantitative comparison of the 
theory with observations . The maj or conclusion of thi s  analysis is 
that the wide spread 
scatter of the data in the Z vs Log M /M 
g 
T 
plane cannot be interpreted by the stochastic mechanism alone . 
Thi s  in the reasonable assumption that besides the observational 
uncertainties , part of the scatter i s  intrinsic . Three ways out are 
indicated, namely i )  variation in the yield of metal s ; i i )  different 
importance of the infall rate relative to the star formation rate ; 
iii ) different importance of the galactic wind rate relative to the 
star formation rate . This last option is very attractive as galactic 
winds are likely to occur in galaxies of thi s  type , which are 
loosely bound and occasionally may suffer from very intense bursts 
of star formation . Future implementation of data on metallicities , 
gas and total masses are highly desirable to cast light on thi s  
problem .

Summary 
In thi s paper we present updated chemical yields of C ,  0 and Fe 
for both Pop I and Pop III stars . 
These yields are used to study 
the history of production of C ,  0 and Fe in the galactic disk . 
We find that the yields and yield ratios must have varied during 
the disk life in order to account for the observed abundances of 
C ,  0 and Fe ( Clegg et al 1981 ) .  The temporal variation of the 
yield of C ,  0 and Fe consistent with the observed abundances i s  
derived 
i n  the context o f  a simple model o f  disk evolution . 
The 
resulting yields of 0 and Fe cannot be easily explained by standard 
prescriptions for the evolution of massive stars . 
The suggestion 
arises that 0 and Fe are produced by stars in different ranges of 
mass , whereas C is ej ected by both low-intermediate mass and mas­
sive stars . 
Finally , constraints to the chemical make-up of the 
very early stellar generations are derived. 
Introduction 
In recent years , evidence has been accumulating that the nucleo­
synthetic production of several important elements such as C ,  N ,  
0 and Fe has varied during the galaxy life .

have clearly shown that the l o /Fe l ratio in the sun i s  different 
from that in metal poor halo stars , indicating that the first stars 
in the disk formed out of gas 
already 0-rich relative to Fe . 
Clegg et al . ( 1 98 1 )  analysing a sample of unevolved 
F and G disk 
stars , pointed out that while the abundance of C and N closely 
follow that of Fe , the 0 abundance varies much more slowly than 
Fe . 
More preci sely , the following relationships were established : 
l o /Fe l = o . 6 for -2 . 5  ¾ I Fe/H I ¾ - 1 , 
l o /Fe [ 
= -o . 48 [ Fe/H I for 
- 1  ¾ I Fe/H I ¾ o . 4 ,  
l c/Fe l 
0 . 1 6 I Fe/H [ and [ N/Fe [ 
= 0 ,  these 
latest two all over the range of Fe . An important new dimension 
to this problem 
has been added by Bessel and Norri s  ( 1 982 ) who 
found two extremely metal poor stars ( HD14000 and HD 1 606 1 7 )  with 
I Fe/H I = -2 , in which N is significantly overabundant , 1 . 1 ¾ I N/Fe l 
¾ 
2 .  
The most natural implications of these observations are that 
the production of 0 and N during the first stellar generations has 
proceeded decoupled from Fe , and that in these stars N was produced 
as a primary element . 
On the other hand, N production in the stars 
of Clegg et al . ( 1 98 1 )  is consi stent with the notion of a secondary 
process , even though there is at present a growing evidence that 
part of N ought to be of primary origin ( Pagel and Edmunds , 1 98 1  
and references therein ) .  The understanding of the relative elemen­
tal abundances is a subj ect of great complexity and uncertainty 
owing to its relationships to many aspects of galactic evolution , 
such as stellar nucleosynthesis , star formation and stellar mass 
function , which are still points of contention . The most recent 
study of this problem is by Twarog and Wheeler ( 1 982 ) who discussed 
the data of Clegg et al . ( 1 98 1 ) in the context of standard nucleo­
synthesi s  prescriptions and a simple model of galactic evolution . 
Their chemical yields are based on the mass function of Miller and 
Scalo ( 1 919 ) and the stellar elemental production of Arnett ( 1 918 ) ,  
whereas the chemical model of galactic evolution i s  as in Twarog 
( 1 980 ) .  
Maj or conclusions of their study were : i )  Clegg ' s  et al . 
( 1 98 1 )  data are consistent with the assumption of the yield ratios 
being constant with time ; 
i i ) Standard yields ( Arnett ' data plus 

THE OXYGEN ANOMALY IN METAL POOR STARS

Miller ' s  and Scalo ' s  stellar mass function ) lead to overproduction 
of 0 and C relative to Fe ; 
i i i ) The high l o /Fe l ratio for the most 
metal poor stars strongly indicates that 0 was truly overproduced 
over the very early stages of galactic evolution ( presumably the 
halo phase ) .  Thi s  likely requires stellar yields different from 
Arnett ( 1 978 ) and/or a mass spectrum for these stars skewed in 
favour of 
very mass ive obj ect s . 
Nevertheless , the recent develop­
ments in stellar models all over the range of masses , in the stellar 
mass function for massive stars .and finally in the chemical yields 
fully j ustify a 
new examination of the problem at the hand . 
In 
this paper , first 
we endeavour to show that Clegg ' s  et al . ( 1 981 ) 
data imply a variation of the yields during the disk lifetime . 
Secondly , we put forward a plausible way out of the difficulties 
encoutered by Twarog and Wheeler ( 1 982 ) by assuming that the yields 
have changed in the course of galactic evolution .  
Finally , we 
derive some constraints to the chemical make-up and stellar mass 
function holding for the first stellar generations . 
1 .  Properties of stellar models relevant to the yields 
In the following , we briefly summarize those advancements in stel­
lar models that may be relevant to yield calculat ions . 
i )  Low and intermediate mass stars ( 1  MG ¾ M ɒ 9 MG ) 
Renzini and Voli ( 1 98 1 )  have followed the evolution of the surface

. 
abundances of He , C 
, C 
, and 0 
from the main sequence phase ,  
till the stage of envelope ej ection . 
The following 
physical pro­
cesses have been taken into account : convective dredge up , by which 
the external convection brings to the surface nuclearly processed 
material ; nuclear burning in the deepest layers of the convective 
envelope itself ; mass loss by stellar wind during the red giant 
and asympthotic giant branch and envelope ej ection leading to the 
formati on of planetary nebulae . 
These calculations show that inter-
1 2

ݘ4  
mediate mass stars are important sources of C 
, H e  and primary N 
, 
this latter via the hot bottom burning mechanism .  
Furthermore , they 

420 
also conGtitute an important source of c 1 3 . 
i i ) Massive stars ( 9  M0 ¾ M « 1 20 M0 ) 
C. CHIOSI AND F. MATTEUCCI 
Since the bare core calculations of Arnett ( 1 978 ) , new important 
results have been achieved during the past few years . 
It is how­
ever worth recalling that Arnett ' s  ( 1 978 ) models , in whi ch initial­
ly pure He stars of mass Ma have been evolved up and through the 
very latest stages of Si-burning , electron capture and thermal 
disintegration , have been commonly used to determine the stellar 
yields of heavy elements .  
These yields were given as a function 
of M 
and in turn , once a M ( M  
) relationship is assigned , as a 
a 
a 
function of the initial mass of the star . 
One of the maj or uncer-
tainties was the M ( M  ) itself , which in Arnett ( 1 978 ) was derived 
a 
from constant mass models . 
The effect of mass los s by stellar 
wind was pointed out by Chiosi and Caimmi ( 1 979 ) and Dearborn and 
Blake ( 1 979 ) .  
The elemental yields were expected to decrease with 
incresing 
mass loss rate , due to the different M(M ) relation for 
a 
mass losing models . 
However , some assumptions justified in the 
above studies turned out to be inadequate in the light of subse­
quent results on stellar nucleosynthesis and mass loss by stellar 
wind . 
In particular , a new dimension to elemental nucleosynthesis 
is given by the work of Woosley and Weaver ( 1 982 and references 
therein ) ,  whereas the role played by mass loss has been recently 
focussed by Maeder ( 1 98 1 and references therein ) .  As for the latter 
point , the effect of deep external convection in the red supergiant 
phase 
and of mass loss during the so called WR stages has 
been 
clarified . 
Nevertheless , due to the many uncertainties still 
affecting the evolution of massive stars in presence of mass loss , 
the net amounts of various elements ej ected at the end of a massive 
star life is very uncertain . 
An amalgamation of Arnett ' s  ( 1 978 ) 
stellar yields of heavy elements and main properties of models 
evolved in presence of mass loss is given by Maeder ( 1 98 1 ) .  
i i i ) Very massive stars ( 1 20 M0 « M « 300 M0 ) 
While the mechanism whereby stars lighter than 1 00 M8 become super-

novae has always been controversial , the pair instability is com­
monly thought of to be responsible of explosion in more massive 
stars . 
The main difficulty with these very massive stars is that 
very few , i f  any at all , are believed to be forming nowadays . 
However there are reasons for believing that very massive stars 
exi sted in the early evolution of galaxies ( Carr et al . 1 982 ) , 
providing the 
very first burst of chemical enrichment . 
Another 
important question , i s  the mas s range for which pair instability 
leads to 
supernova explosion . 
The numerical models of Woosley 
and Weaver ( 1 982 ) , El Eid et al . ( 1 982 ) , Ober et al . ( 1 982) and 
the semianalytical analysi s  of Bond et al . ( 1 982 ) set this range 
of mass from about 1 20 M0 to about 300 M8 , even though the upper 
limit i s  found to depend on the rate of mass loss during core H­
and He-burning phases . Stars more mass ive than about 300 M8 are 
still pair unstable ,  but they likely collapse into black holes . 
The numerical models of very massive stars of Pop I have been car­
ried out at constant mass ( Woosley and Weaver , 1 982 ) , while on the 
contrary mass los s is likely to be important . 
Conversely , models 
of very mass ive stars pertinent to the first stellar generation 
( Pop III ) have been evolved in presence of mas s loss , thereby 
supposed to be driven by the nuclear energized vibrational insta­
bility ( Ober et al . 1 982 ; El Eid et al . 1 982 ) . 
The most distinct 
feature of these stars is that 0 is synthesized and ej ected in 
great amounts ,  whereas no significant amounts of elements heavier 
4o 
than Ca 
are produced. 
2 .  Chemical yields 
With the aid 
of the nucleosynthesis results recalled in the fore­
going section and the formali sm of Talbot and Arnett ( 1 973 ) , we 
have computed the yields per stellar generation of several important 
elements ( H e ,  c 1 2 , 0 1 6 , Si-Fe and Si-Ca-S ) for a variety of stellar 
mas s functions . 
In particular , the yields are presented for stars 
of Pop I and Pop III ( zero initial metallicity ) chemical composition . 
Talbot ' s  and Arnett ' s  ( 1 973 ) formalism ,  particularly suited for 

422 
C. CHIOSI AND F. MATTEUCCI 
studies of chemical evolution , describes the ejected nucleosynthe­
sis products from stars in terms of a production matrix which invol­
ves all elemental species .

ej ected as species i .  <!> (M) is the stellar mass function , whereas 
Mu and Ġ stand for low and upper mass limit of born stars . The 
stellar mass function obeys the following normalization condition 
<!> (M) dM 
( 2 )  
where s denotes the fraction of mass of <!>(M) in stars more massi­
ve than

Two different stellar mass functions have been used 
assuming <l>(M) 
cr M-x . The first one is the Salpeter ( 1 9 5 5 )  mass 
function of slope x 
= 1 . 35 which incidentally is very similar to 
the recent determination of Garmany et al . ( 1 982 ) in the domain of 
massive stars . 
The second mass function is derived from Serrano 
and Peimbert ( 1 98 1 ) and Lequeux ( 1 979 ) . 
The slope is x 
= 0 . 6 for 
0 . 007 M8 ¾ M ݗ 1 . 8 MG and x 
= 2 above . 
The resulting yields and 
characterizing parameters are reported in Table 1 for a few cases 
of interest . 
A more detailed description of these calculations 
is reported elsewhere ( Chiosi and Matteucci , 1 983 ) .

Following Twarog and Wheeler ( 1 982 ) , we analyze the data of Clegg

tion of the galactic disk . 
Prior to this , a few important aspects 
of the problem must be clarified. A potential source of ambiguity 
in the comparison of theoretical results with the observational data 
is the absolute abundances of various elements within the sun , as 
the observational determinations are customarily referred to these 
latter . 
We adopt the abundances of C ,  0 and Fe for the sun given 
by Cameron ( 1 973 ) and assume the solar mass fraction of hydrogen 
to be 0 .  73 . 
Thus the abundances relative to H for the three 
are 
l e/H i e = -2 .22 ,  l o/H I 0 
= -1 .83 and ! Fe/H i e 
= -2 . 57 in 
usual notation .  Furthermore , as the solar 1abundances used by 
elements 
the 
Clegg et al . ( 1 98 1 ) were not exactly the same as above , we have 
normalized their data to our solar values ,  for the sake of internal 
consistency . 
These revised data have been used to derive the fol-

which for I Fe/HI = - 1  gives I O/Fe I = 0 . 60 .  The reason for this 
redefinition of the observational material is threefold : 
i )  in-
ternal consistency ; 
ii ) smoothing of the observational scatter ; 
iii ) better derivation of the initial boundary conditions of the 
model . As for the latest point , it will turn out that part of the 
disagreement between theoretical results and observational data in 
Twarog and Wheeler ( 1982 ) was due to inadequate initial values . 
Further constraint to the chemical model is imposed by the I Fe/H I 
versus age relation of Twarog ( 1 980 ) . 
This relation has been adap­
ted to the assumption that the disk is 1 3x109 yr old and that the 
9 
age of the sun is 4 . 5x10 yr . 
The well known 
set of differential 
equations is used to follow the chemical evolution of the galactic 
disk .

First , to i solate the effect of updated yields , we cal cu 
late models with the same input parameters as in Twarog and Wheeler 
( 1 982 ) and constant yields . 
Second , the effect of chemical yields 
varying during the disk evolution is tested always adopting the 
same input parameters as above . More precisely , the rate of star

The initial H abundance i s  0 . 77 ,  whereas the current abundance of

years . The return fraction R i s  derived from equation ( 1 1 )  and 
with the adopted parameters it amounts to 0 . 3 5 .  
To determine re­
lations ( 9 )  we proceed as follows . 
We start imposing that at the 
present time the yields and chemical abundances are those typical 
of the young stars . 
For these latter , we as sume XC = 4 . 5  ( -3 ) , 
x0 
= 1 . 1 ( -2 )  and XFe 
= 2 . 0  ( -3 )  ( Pagel and Edmunds , 1 9 8 1 ) .  Conver­
sely , while we assume that at the beginning of disk evolution , the 
abundances are those given by relations ( 3 )  and ( 4 )  for J Fe/H J 
= -1
, 
the correspondent yields are considered as free parameters of the

problem. When a particular choice is made for these latter , the 
coefficients A .  and B .  can be fixed and the correspondent model can

be calculated. The above procedure is repeated by varying the 
yields of the earliest epochs till when a guess model is derived 
reasonably matching all major observational constraints . 
This guess 
model provides Y . (X . ) relationships which are repeatedly adjusted

the least squares f'its of' l e/H I and i o/H i versus t F'e/H i . 'I'ab_l_e 2

Figure 
·1 shows the Fe versus age relation for models A and B, 
whereas Figure 2 presents the C to Fe and 0 to Fe histories for 
the same models . 
While the theoretical expectations for Fe and 0 
are similar to those of Twarog and Wheeler ( 1 982 ) , we disagree in 
what C is concerned . 
In fact , their theoretical C abundances are 
too low when compared to the revised data. The opposite holds , 
when the original data of Clegg et al . ( 198 1 ) are compared to the 
results of Twarog and Wheeler ( 1982 ) . Since our models practically

coincides with those of Twarog 
and Wheeler ( 1982 ) at the Fe 
rich end of Fig . 2 ,  they point 
out the effect of different 
initial abundances . Coming back 
to our models ,  the disagreement 
between theory and observations 
is alleviated if the case a= 1 
and/or a=O of Renzini and Voli 
( 198 1 ) are used to derive the 
yield of C .  In fact the pro­
duction of C gets smaller with 
increasing a ( efficient hot bottom burning ) .  The main conclusions 
of this preliminary analysis 
are the following . 
In the 
context of standard nucleosyn­
thesis ,  a Salpeter like mass 
function with s=0 . 25 ought to 
be favoured to account the ti-
me history of Fe . This choice 
is substanciated for young 
stars by the results of Garma­
ny et al . ( 1982 ) . Second, the 
enrichment histories cannot be 
reproduced with constant yields 
of C ,  0 and Fe . This is equiva­
lent to say that either the 
mass function or the stellar 
nucleosynthesis make up or both 
have varied over the history of 
the disk. Third, the chemical 
composition of the initial gas

uncertainty . The processes that led to O enrichment may have also 
contributed to build up C in appreciable amounts .  The assumption 
of a C abundance as low as that of Fe may be incorrect .  We discuss 
now models calculated with the same input parameters , but with 
variable yields ( relation ( 9 ) )  as presented in Table 2 .  The results 
are schematically shown in Fig . 3 and 4 which diplay the \ Fe/H I

tions in the order . 
It is soon evident that the difficulty of 0

remains . This latter can be partially removed by using other

As already pointed out , the 
observational data seem to 
require a more efficient C 
production . 
To this purpose 
we recompute the model repla­
cing the yield of C for the 
present stellar populations 
of Table 2 with Ye = 4 . 74( -3 ) 
which is derived with the 
same mass function ( slope x 
and fraction s ) , but using 
the data of Renzini and Voli 
( 1981 ) for a 
= O. As expec-
ted , C is more abundant and 
it varies with respect to Fe as shown by the dotted line in Fig . 4 . 
The main result of this analysis is that the yields of C ,  0 and 
Fe may have varied during the disk evolution as depicted in Fig . 6 .  
We consider the model discussed in this section as fairly repre­
senting the true disk evolution as it obeys all major observatio­
nal constraints . in fact , besides matching the chemical properties , 
this model has 
s/ < s > ratio equal to 1 . 5 ,  which is below the 
limit imposed by current estimates .

THE OXYGEN ANOMALY IN METAL POOR STARS 
Due to the iterative procedure used to fix the run of chemical 
yields with abundances and /or age , the final values shown in 
431 
Fig . 6 have somehow lost the memory of their input values .  Further­
more , the yields predicted by our method even for the young stars 
for which the best information i s  available ,  are significantly 
different from those reported in Table 1 .  Therefore , it seems 
worth examining whether they are still compatible with the under­
lying assumptions . Table 3 summarizes the input and output yields 
for the present stellar generations .

5 .  Discussion of the yields 
In the context of the nucleosynthesis prescription we have been 
using , 0 and Fe are ej ected by mass ive stars only (M > 1 0  M0 ) ,  
whereas low and intermediate mass stars and massive stars concur 
in about equal amounts to determine the yield of C .  According to 
our expectation ( Table 3 )  the production of 0 by massive stars 
should be about a factor of 4 ,  whereas that of C and Fe a factor 
of 1 . 6 lower than predicted by standard yields . 
Prior to any 
other consideration , it should be pointed out that the mass funct­
ion for massive stars is l ikely to be very similar to the one we 
have adopted ( Garmany et al . 1 982 ) . 
The fraction Ř is more unce_!:_ 
tain . Therefore it is worth exploring whether different values for 
Ř would give different yields and yield ratios . It is easy to 
understand that while the 
yields change , their ratios do not , as 
shown by the data reported in Table 1 .  As 
already suggested by 

432 
C. CHIOSI AND'F. MATTEUCCI 
Twarog and Wheeler ( 1982 ) , to lower the yields and to change their 
ratios , we can alter the mass function so that certain stars do 
not explode but perhaps collapse into black holes . 
We perform 
this exercise by systematically lowering the upper cutoff mass 
in the Salpeter mass function with s =0 . 2 5 .  This is shown in Fig . 
* 
7 as a function of Mu ' the mass limit for exploding stars .

The asterisks visualize the 
cutoff mass needed to reprodu­
the desired yields . We are 
however left with the uncom-
fortably low masses that would 
y be required . This case refers 
Fe 
0 
to massive stars evolved in 
occurrence of a moderate rate 
of mass loss by stellar wind . 
The inclusion of substancial 
mass loss would shift the 
cutoff mass to higher values 
as the total yields are lower . 
Even in this case the difficulty 
remains of different cutoff 
masses for different elements .  
On the other hand , the kind of nu-
cleosynthesis in massive stars we have been using is based on the 
assumption that the collapse of the iron core is eventually capa­
ble of generating a strong outgoing shock that will ej ect and some­
how reprocess all the material outside a mass shell of about 1 . 4-
1 . 5 M8 . 
This assumption has been often questioned . A exhaustive 
review of the topic is by Woosley and Weaver ( 1982 ) . 
It suffices 
here to mention that our view concerning the nucleosynthesis of 
heavy elements would be radically altered if stars more massive

The comparison of the data of Fig . 6 with the entries of Table 4 
may suggest that the case with high <M> and a =O predicts yields 
that fairly agree with our expectation . 
Nevertheles s ,  owing to the 
many uncertainties , we consider our analysis as very preliminary 
and deserving further investigation . 
5 .  Conclusions 
In this paper we have used the data of Clegg et al . ( 1 98 1 )  to place 
constraints to the hi story of C ,  0 and Fe over the lifetime of the 
disk . 
Our main conclusions and differences with respect of Twarog 
and Wheeler ( 1 98 2 )  are that the yields of these elements may have 

434 
C. CHIOSI AND F. MATTEUCCI 
varied with time , thus accounting for Fe production without over­
producing 0 and/or C even under current stellar mass functions . 
However , the resulting yields suited for the observational require­
ment cannot be easily fitted into the classical nucleosynthesis 
scenarios seeing massive stars as the dominant contributors to 0 
and Fe at the same time . 
Furthermore , the high l o /Fe l ratio for 
the most metal poor stars seems to require the kind of chemical 
make up we have suggested for the earliest epochs .  
This implies 
a true 0 overproduction like the one in our Pop III yields and an 
initial mass function skewed in favour of massive stars . Notewhorty 
our best model has the fraction ( 
of massive stars decreasing 
from the initial value of about 0 . 5  to the present value of 0 . 25 . 
Finally , the existence of low and intermediate mass stars in the 
very first stellar generation cannot be excluded on the base of the 
present analysis . On the contrary , the existence of such stars was 
a distinct ingredient in the calculation of suitable chemical yields . 
We conclude saying that the chemical history of the galactic disk 
can perhaps be used as a probe of ealier enrichment .

"LINERS" AND ABUNDANCES IN GALACTIC NUCLEI 
B .E .J. Pagel 
Royal Greenwich Observatory , Herstmonceux, Sussex, U.K. 
SUMMARY 
[NII] AA 6548, 6584 increase in strength relative to Ha in 
HII regions as the overall abundance of heavy elements is 
increased, but in some galactic nuclei A6584 is still stronger 
than Ha , which never happens in conventional HII regions ionised 
by hot stars . 
These nuclei are either of the narrow-line or 
intermediate Seyfert type or of the more common variety called 
"LINERS" by Heckman or sometimes "Seyfert 3". Earlier 
observations and calculations of relative emission line strengths 
in LINERS suggested that they form a distinct group from Seyferts 
with a distinct excitation mechanism (shock heating as opposed to 
photo-ionisation by a power-law continuum) but recently several 
authors have shown that photo-ionisation may account for both. 
More recent observations confirm that LINERS are continuous with 
Seyferts and that the enhancement of [ NII] /Ha is largely an 
excitation effect unless these nuclei differ in composition from 
nearby HII regions . 
1 .  INTRODUCTION 
In spiral galaxies with HII regions , the line intensity 
ratio [ NII] /Ha decreases as one goes outwards from the central 
regions while [ OLII] /HB increases . Both effects are explained 
following Searleryas consequences of a rad ial abundance gradient 
which is chiefly an outward decreasing ratio of heavy elements 
( typified by oxygen) to hydrogen. Variations in N/O also occur , 
but these are smaller than the variations on O/H.2) 
For HII 
regions , especially giant ones , line ratios such as [ OIII] /HB ,

[ OIII] /[ NII] and ([ OII] + [ OIII] ) /H8 can be calibrated against 
the oxygen abundance.3 )4 )5 )6 ) 
Emission-line spectra in galactic nuclei themselves can 
belong to one of three types.7) 
Late-type galaxies like M33 ,  
MlOl and probably M83 have low-excitation, oxygen-rich HII 
regions in, or very close to , their nuclei, which simply continue 
the trend shown by HII regions in the arms or reverse it to a 
slight extent. M83 is classified as a "hot spot" galaxy8) with 
separate bright knots in the nucleus which consist of supergiant 
HII regions embedded in clouds of dust , Another hot-spot 
galaxy, the barred spiral NGC 1365 , has a true nucleus with a 
Seyfert galaxy spectrum, surrounded by HII regionsਚ ; we do 
not know how common such effects may be . 
The Seyfert galaxies constitute the second type of nuclear 
spectrum, where the nucleus is bright and, in the narrow-line 
component of the spectrum, [ OIII] vastly outshines H8 , in 
contrast to the nuclear HII regions where owing to the high 
abundances [OUI] is always weak and often invisible .  At the 
same time [ NII] A6584 in narrow-lined Seyferts is comparable in 
strength to Ha, which is two or three times as strong as [ NII] 
in even low-excitation HII regions . These effects are 
attributable to ionisation by a hard radiation spectrum 
approximating a power law . 1 0) 
The third type of spectrum is that of the objects which 
Heckman7) has called "Liners" ,  i . e .  low ionisation emission-line 
regions , which are found in many Sb and Sc nuclei such as M81 
and M51 as well as in elliptical galaxies like M87 and NGC1052 , 
often in association with a compact radio source . 
In these 
cases [ NII] is usually as strong as Ha or stronger1 1) 1 2) and the 
H8 emission is so weak that it is often only detectable after 
subtraction of a similar galaxy spectrum without emission lines . 
[ OIII] A5007 is stronger than HS , but by a smaller factor than 
in a narrow-lined Seyfert . Following Koski and Osterbrock1 3) 
and others , Heckman supposed that Liners result from shock 
heating, as did Baldwin, Phillips and Terlevich14) (BPT) who 
developed a classification scheme for emission-line spectra of 
extragalactic obj ects in which finers occupy a distinct region 
of parameter space . Stauffer1 5 has found a few objects with 
spectra intermediate between Seyferts and Liners which he 
suggests could have mixed excitation mechanisms . 
On the other hand , Pequignot1 6) and Ferland and Netzer1 7) have 
suggested that Liners can be explained by photo-ionisation with 
the same power law Fv  v-1 . 5  as Seyferts but with lower 
ionisation parameter, thereby making it appropriate to call 
them Seyfert 3 .  (The ionisation parameter is the ratio of photon 
density or flux at the Lyman limit to electron density .) 

"LINERS" AND ABUNDANCES IN GALACTIC NUCLEI 
What I wish to do in this short talk is to present some 
recent AAT observations which bear on two questions : -
( i) I s  shock excitation or power-law photoionisation the 
more plausible excitation mechanism for Liners? and 
( ii) Is nitrogen overabundant in some or all of them? 
Other recent observations , in particular of M81 ,18) MS119) and 
NGC 13659>tvill also be brought into the discussion. 
2 .  OBSERVATIONS 
The following emission-line galactic nuclei were observed 
at the Anglo-Australian Telescope using the Boksenberg Image 
Photon Counting System in October 1981 by M.G. Edmunds and 
M.M. Phillips or in August 1982 by B .E . J .  Pagel :-

The observations were made with a 50 arc sec long slit which 
included not only the actual nuclei but also normal galaxy 
spectra including in some cases normal HII regions a few 
hundred parsecs away (l" :: lOOpc at 20 Mpc) . 
Thus , in addition 
to comparing nuclear spectra with photo ionisation and shock 
models , we can also make some deductions about ambient element 
abundances from the spectra of the nearby HII regions . 
Observational line intensity ratios have been de-reddened 
assuming the conventional Case B Balmer decrement . 
3 .  DISCUSSION 
In this paper we shall consider mainly the following three 
diagrams : 
[OIII] /HB against [OII] / (OIII] ,  [NII] /Ha against 
(OII] / (OIII] and [NII] /Ha against [OIII] /HB . 
The f irst two 
diagrams have been used both by BPT1 4) and by Ferland and 
Netzer17) ; the third , which has also been considered by BPT , 
is easier to determine observationally , being independent of 
reddening and calibration uncertainties .

Fig. 1 is a copy of Ferland and Netzer ' s  Figure 2 whereon 
I have superimposed the loci for HII regions from BPT and for 
shock models from Shull and McKee . Most of the points that lie 
low in the two panels represent objects that I believe to be HII 
regions , because [OIII] , [OII] and [NII] are not very strong and 
[OI] A6300/Ha < 0.05 (cf .  BPT , Fig 4 ;  Ferland and Netzer ,Fig . 3) ; 
these points have been circled in the diagram. Bearing in mind 
that other points may be affected by radiation from adjoining 
HII regions , it is evident that either shock or power-law 
photoionisation models fit the Liners reasonably well . 
Furthermore , with photoionisation , most points are consistent 
with something quite close to solar abundances , while with the 
shock models an overabundance of nitrogen by a factor of 3 or so 
would be indicated for a typical object . If this were indeed 
the case, then one might expect it to show up also in spectra of 
galactic nuclei that have HII regions instead of Liners .

Fig . 2 is an updated version of a diagram given by Pagel and 
Edmunds2) in which galactic nuclear HII regions are indicated 
by circled symbols with their names . Apparently N/O never 
exceeds solar by more than 0 . 2  dex and (O/H, N/H) never exceed 
solar by more than (0. 3 ,  0.4) dex. The evidence is not exactly 
compelling , but it does give us a certain predilection in 
favour of photoionisation. 
Another feature of Ferland and Netzer 's figure, as of those 
of BPT, is the apparent existence of a gap between Seyferts and 
Liners . Stauffer 5 )  found some intermediate objects and such, 
indeed , would be expected if photoionisation is dominant 
throughout . A real gap , on the other hand , located (as it 
apparently is) just where the shock locus undergoes a sharp 
change of slope , would strongly suggest that the mechanism is 
changing over at this point .

of Ferland and Netzer (after removal of suspected HII regions 
among their objects) . Solid, broken and dotted lines represent 
power-law photoionisation, shocks and HII regions respectively 
as in Fig . 1 .  For the HII regions , loci of constant oxygen abund­
ances are marked by diagonal lines with (12+log (O/H) ) indicated . 

"LINERS" AND ABUNDANCES IN GALACTIC NUCLEI 
443 
With these considerations in mind , we can now look and see 
what the new data from the AAT and other sources do to the 
appearance of the various BPT diagrams . We shall consider here 
just one diagram, that of [NII] /Ha against [OIII] /HB (Fig 3) . 
On the diagram we plot the line ratios both in the nucleus 
proper , where the relative strength of forbidden lines is a 
maximum, and in outlying parts of the slit where the spectrum is 
modified and eventually dominated by surrounding HII regions . 
Our data, together with those of Peimbert and Torres-Peimbert1 8) 
on M81, evidently fill the gap between classical Seyferts and 
Liners and fit the predicted curve for photoionisation with 
solar abundances quite well; naturally variations by up to a 
factor of 2 between different galaxies ,  as shown in Fig. 2 ,  are 
not excluded . 
Within this factor , then, it seems reasonable to accept 
that most Seyferts and Liners are galactic nuclei of normal 
composition photo-ionised by a power-law continuum. However , 
a few objects have even stronger [NII] /Ha than is accounted for 
by this formula : most notable among these is M5119), which 
according to the diagram is a Seyfert at the very centre ( 7 , 3 . 5) ,  
but comes closer to the Liner region from a radius of 5ਐ arc sec 
(X 250pc) outwards , which as Rose and Searle point out is just 
as one might expect if the ionisation parameter decreases 
outwards . Beyond 5਑" we get (as in other cases) a mixing line 
with increasing contributions from conventional HII regions 
until at a distance of 15" or about 700pc we have a pure HII 
region with solar abundances (using the calibration of [OIII ] /  
[NII] in HII regions given by Pagel e t  al4) ) • 
Our own data show something similar happening in NGC1097, 
1433, and 7590 , with some indication that 1097 has the largest 
overall abundances among the nuclear HII regions in the diagram, 
consistent with the rather high point occupied by its Liner 
nucleus . 
In other words , the nuclear abundances are in 
agreement with the nearby HII region abundances in most cases . 
From this I am tempted to conclude that, apart from overall heavy­
element or metallicity enhancements by up to a factor of 2 or so , 
the great strength of [NII] lines in Liners is chiefly an 
excitation effect due to hard-spectrum phot·')ionisation rather 
than an abundance effect . This could perhaps even apply to M51 ;  
however , this extreme case appears to deserve further study . 
I am grateful to the PATT for assigning time on the AAT 
for this project and to the Director and staff of the Anglo­
Australian Observatory for their cooperation.
