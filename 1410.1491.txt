Ergodicity in quantum many-body systems is—despite its fundamental importance—still an open
problem. Many-body localization provides a general framework for quantum ergodicity, and may
therefore oﬀer important insights. However, the characterization of many-body localization through
simple observables is a diﬃcult task. In this article, we introduce a measure for distances in Hilbert
space for spin-1/2 systems that can be interpreted as a generalization of the Anderson localiza-
tion length to the many-body Hilbert space.
We show that this many-body localization length
is equivalent to a simple local observable in real space, which can be measured in experiments of
superconducting qubits, polar molecules, Rydberg atoms, and trapped ions. Using the many-body
localization length and a necessary criterion for ergodicity that it provides, we study many-body
localization and quantum ergodicity in power-law-interacting Ising models subject to disorder in the
transverse ﬁeld. Based on the nonequilibrium dynamical renormalization group, numerically exact
diagonalization, and an analysis of the statistics of resonances we ﬁnd a many-body localized phase
at inﬁnite temperature for small power-law exponents. Within the applicability of these methods,
we ﬁnd no indications of a delocalization transition.

INTRODUCTION
Ergodicity is a fundamental concept of statistical
physics. If a classical system is ergodic, phase-space tra-
jectories cover uniformly constant energy hyper-surfaces,
such that time and microcanonical ensemble averages be-
come equivalent1.
Although attempts to extend these
ideas to the quantum regime date back to von Neu-
mann’s quantum ergodic theorem2,3, a general concep-
tual understanding of quantum ergodicity has not yet
been achieved4. This, however, is crucial for fundamental
questions such as regarding the thermalization of closed
quantum many-body systems. A lack of quantum ergod-
icity can, in analogy to the classical phase-space descrip-
tion, be seen as localization in Hilbert space, for which a
general framework has been introduced recently: many-
body localization(MBL)5–7.
MBL phases exhibit further peculiar properties8,9 be-
yond the fundamental question of quantum ergodicity.
Perhaps most notable among them is a universal tem-
poral growth of entanglement following global quenches
out of weakly entangled initial states10–14. Additionally,
MBL phases can exhibit ﬁnite-temperature phase tran-
sitions even in one dimension7,15, which are excluded
for thermodynamic phases. Even more, many-body lo-
calization can stabilize order in one dimension over the
full spectrum16–18, which may be of interest for design-
ing quantum-information devices8. Compared to conven-
tional localization in real space19,20, however, theoretical
calculations of many-body localization suﬀer from the
complexity of the underlying geometry—the many-body
Hilbert space. Therefore, revealing many-body localiza-
tion properties and ﬁnding suitable, experimentally ac-
cessible quantities for their characterization remains chal-
lenging.
In this article, we introduce an observable that mea-
sures distances in Hilbert space, and as such can be
interpreted as a many-body generalization of the An-
derson localization length.
Importantly, it can be ob-
tained via simple local measurements such as on-site
magnetizations.
This observable thus opens a feasible
and eﬃcient route for studying many-body localization
in experiments. Using this measure, we study in detail
the disordered quantum Ising model with power-law in-
teractions at small power-law exponent α ≤1, which
is relevant to experiments on polar molecules, Rydberg
atoms, superconducting qubits, and trapped ions. Our
calculations predict that transverse-ﬁeld disorder drives
the model into a MBL phase even at inﬁnite tempera-
ture. These ﬁndings are drawn from the recently intro-
duced nonequilibrium dynamical renormalization group
(ndRG)21, from extensive numerical simulations using
exact diagonalization (ED), as well as from an analysis
of the statistics of resonant Hilbert-space conﬁgurations.
Within the applicability of these methods, we ﬁnd no
indications of a delocalization transition, even for weak
disorder strength.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Sec. II we introduce the disordered quantum Ising chain
with power-law interactions, which we use to illustrate
our considerations. Basic principles of many-body local-
ization are discussed in Sec. III, including the main re-
sult of this work, the many-body localization length. In
Sec. IV, we calculate the many-body localization length
for the disordered power-law-interacting Ising chain at in-
ﬁnite temperature, using the ndRG as well as extensive
numerically exact simulations, indicating a many-body
localized phase at nonzero disorder strength. We corrob-
orate these predictions by an analytical analysis of the
statistics of resonances.

LONG-RANGE ISING CHAINS
In this work, we study localization beyond the single-
particle, i.e., Anderson-localized, limit, by considering

natural contexts22—especially in systems with Coulomb,
dipole–dipole, and van-der-Waals interactions—and they
can be synthesized in a variety of architectures, includ-
ing trapped ions23–26, superconducting qubits27–30, polar
molecules31–33, and Rydberg atoms34,35. To connect to
current experiments, we choose antiferromagnetic inter-
actions (J > 0) and open boundary conditions, although
our main results do not dependent on these choices. The
transverse ﬁelds hl ∈[−W, W] are drawn from uncorre-
lated uniform distributions.
In order to assure extensivity of the full many-body

ble against disorder for α > 1 and the magnetic quantum
phase transition is governed by a strong-disorder ﬁxed
point39 with magnetic order only at vanishing temper-
ature. For the fully-connected case at α = 0 the mag-
netic phase extends also to non-zero temperatures, with
a phase boundary as determined in Ref. 37.
Localization properties of the disordered long-range
Ising models in Eq. (1) and related systems have al-
ready been studied in the literature.
First of all, in
the limit α →∞where the long-range model reduces
to an exactly solvable nearest-neighbor Ising chain, the
system becomes an Anderson insulator at nonzero disor-
der strength. At ﬁnite α < ∞, however, the situation is
not completely clear. In particular, it has been argued
that in the regime 1 < α < 2, the system delocalizes at
any ﬁnite disorder strength40. For α > 2 a many-body
localization transition might be possible as observed for
related long-range XXZ chains, it has, however, not been
explicitly shown yet41,42.
For the inﬁnitely connected
limit with α = 0 on the other hand, analytical calcula-
tions have revealed a MBL phase for nonvanishing disor-
der strength37. For the regime 0 < α <= 1, the situation
is much less clear. It is one purpose of this work to show
that the MBL phase at any nonzero disorder strength in
the long-range Ising chains extends from α = 0 to the
entire regime α <= 1.

MANY-BODY LOCALIZATION LENGTH
In this section, we discuss in more detail many-body
localization and its connection to quantum ergodicity.
In particular, we will explicitly show the mapping of
interacting spin models, such as the Hamiltonian in
Eq. (1), onto noninteracting Anderson models on a com-
plex graph of spin conﬁgurations. We will then present
the main result of this work, a deﬁnition of a distance
in this complex graph for spin-1/2 models, which can
be interpreted as the many-body localization length and
which is experimentally accessible.
A.
Many-body localization and quantum ergodicity
Quantum ergodicity can be viewed from a dynamical
or a static perspective. Dynamically, quantum ergodic-
ity implies thermalization. The long-time values of local
and quasi-local observables after a nonequilibrium evolu-
tion coincide with those of a thermal ensemble for almost
any initial condition, because time and ensemble averages
are equivalent. There is, however, one particular situa-
tion where ergodicity is not suﬃcient for thermalization,
but rather requires an additional principle21: Whenever
the asymptotic long-time state of a system, when ther-
malized, lies in a symmetry-broken phase of the model,
a dynamical symmetry breaking has to occur restrict-
ing the long-time dynamics to one symmetry-broken sec-
tor. The Eigenstate-Thermalization-Hypothesis (ETH)
has been conjectured as an underlying principle for ther-
malization in closed quantum many-body systems43–46:
If ETH holds for a given system, then it thermalizes.
However, the connection between microscopic details of
a system and the applicability of ETH is still not fully
clariﬁed. Note that in this article we do not distinguish
between ergodicity and mixing1, because the observables
under study approach stationary values during time evo-
lution, so long-time averages (ergodicity) and asymptotic
long-time values (mixing) coincide.
From a static point of view, quantum ergodicity can
be associated with delocalization in Hilbert space6. Let
|s⟩= |s1, . . . , sN⟩, with |sl⟩= |↑⟩, |↓⟩, be an arbitrary
spin conﬁguration in the σz basis, i.e., an eigenstate of
the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) at J = 0. Adiabatically turning
on the coupling J deforms the eigenstates and mixes dif-
ferent spin conﬁgurations. When each spin conﬁguration
only acquires weak perturbative corrections, the system
will remain localized in Hilbert space around the J = 0
eigenstates and will therefore not be ergodic. Delocaliza-
tion, on the other hand, is driven by the proliferation of
resonances between conﬁgurations in Hilbert space.

B.
Mapping onto Anderson model on a complex
graph
With interactions beyond nearest neighbours, the Ising
model in Eq. (1) is not of single-particle type. But still,
following Refs. 6,7, a mapping to a noninteracting (albeit
complex) Anderson model is possible if we represent the
Hilbert space by a lattice where each site is associated
with one spin conﬁguration |s⟩. The Ising model then
ﬁnds an exact mapping to
HIsing =
X
s
Es|s⟩⟨s| +
X
s,s
Vs,s|s⟩⟨s|,
(3)
i.e., an Anderson model on a complex graph with on-
site energies Es = P
l hlsl. The Ising interaction cou-
ples all states that diﬀer by two spin ﬂips, inducing
a hopping with amplitude Vs,s = ⟨s|V |s⟩, where V =
P
l̸=m Jlmσx
l σx
m and Jlm = J /|l −m|α. Although the
Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) is now noninteracting, the prob-
lem is still hard to solve due to the complexity of the
underlying graph. In particular, the hopping in the lat-
tice of spin conﬁgurations is characterized by an uncon-
ventionally high connectivity, i.e., the number of lattice
sites accessible by a single hopping process from a given
site. Compared to the real-space problem, the connec-
tivity is enhanced by a factor proportional to N.
For
example, the variable-range Ising chain has a connectiv-
ity in Hilbert space of N(N −1)/2, in contrast to N −1
in real space.
In the conﬁgurational space, one can deﬁne a distance
d(s, s) between two sites |s⟩and |s⟩by counting the num-
ber of spins that diﬀer between the two conﬁgurations6
(Hamming distance). Fixing one site |s0⟩, the remain-
ing lattice can be classiﬁed by grouping conﬁgurations of
equal distance to |s0⟩into ‘generations’. We deﬁne gen-
eration 1 as those states with d(s, s0) = 2, generation 2
those with d(s, s0) = 4, up to d(s, s0) = N.
C.
Many-body localization length
A good way to characterize localization of an Ander-
son insulator is by monitoring the spread of an initially
localized wave function over time. In our case, an ana-
log approach amounts to initializing the system in a ‘root’
conﬁguration |s0⟩, the most localized object in our graph,
and studying how the mean distance from this initial site,
Ds0(t) =
X
s
d(s, s0)P(s, t),
(4)
increases during time evolution. Here, P(s, t) is deter-
mined by P(s, t) = |⟨s|s0(t)⟩|2, the probability for the
system to be in the conﬁguration |s⟩, where |s0(t)⟩=
U(t)|s0⟩is the initial conﬁguration after time evolution
under U(t) = exp(−iHIsingt).
The challenge is to measure Ds0(t) in practice. As a
major result of this work, this global quantity, character-
izing the wave function in Hilbert space, is related to a

One arrives at this re-
sult from the deﬁnition of Ds0(t) when using d(s, s0) =

l(sl −s0
l )2/4, with sl = +1, −1 for |sl⟩= |↑⟩, |↓⟩. The
Hilbert space property Ds0(t) can therefore be obtained
from purely local measurements in real space, provided
the initial conﬁguration is known. In the context of the
Richardson model, a similar relation has been obtained
recently, which, however, is restricted to particular ini-
tial states and the asymptotic long-time regime47. Our
Eq. (5) is completely general and independent of the spe-
ciﬁc spin system. The local memory χ(t) is well known
in the context of Anderson19 and many-body localiza-
tion48. Equation (5) shows that in the many-body con-
text it has a further important meaning by being related
to distances in Hilbert space.
Since we are interested in localization properties over
the entire spectrum, in our numerics we average the re-
sults over all initial conﬁgurations, which is equivalent to
an inﬁnite-temperature initial state. Averaging also over
disorder, we denote the resulting Hilbert-space distance
as D(t) and the corresponding autocorrelation function
as χ(t). Their relation can then be written as

with ⟨. . . ⟩dis denoting the disorder average. In Fig. 1, the
dynamics of the Hilbert-space distance D(t) is shown for
the disordered long-range Ising chain in Eq. (1).
From Eq. (7), it is now straightforward to character-
ize ergodicity. Since the system can only be ergodic if
the spin conﬁguration at large times is uncorrelated with

4
the initial conﬁguration19, we have that χ(t →∞) =
N −1 P

erage of both the disorder and all initial spin conﬁgura-
tions.
If the system is ergodic, the long-time value of
the local magnetization ⟨σz
l (t →∞)⟩has to approach its
equilibrium value, which in the zero magnetization sector
relevant in this work gives ⟨σz
l (t →∞)⟩= 0. Therefore,
we ﬁnd the following necessary criterion for ergodicity:
D∞

nonergodic

ergodicity possible
(8)
Although D∞= N/2 is only a necessary condition for er-
godicity (e.g., integrable free fermion models easily sat-
isfy it), we would like to emphasize that the condition
D∞< N/2 is suﬃcient for proving nonergodicity be-
cause it implies a preservation of a local memory from
the initial state. The ergodicity condition for D∞might
vary in other cases, e.g., when not working in the zero
magnetization sector. Notice that although the localiza-
tion length is deﬁned for a speciﬁc basis (here, we took
the most natural choice of conﬁgurations in the direction
of disorder), to prove nonergodic behavior it is suﬃcient
to demonstrate the criterion D∞< N/2 for only one
choice of basis.
As a consequence of relation (8), the asymptotic many-
body distance D∞behaves fundamentally diﬀerent from
the real-space localization length in a single-particle An-
derson insulator. To see this, consider an analogous sce-
nario for a conventional Anderson insulator, and let us
again prepare an initially localized wave packet, but now
in real space. Evolving the system to inﬁnite time, the
mean distance is DAI ∝ξ, with ξ the single-particle lo-
calization length, as long as we are close to the Anderson
transition where the long-distance exponential tails dom-
inate over the nonuniversal short-range contributions.
The single-particle localization length ξ is independent
of system size N in the localized phase, provided ξ ≪N,
and diverges when approaching the Anderson transition.
The many-body distance D∞on the other hand is always
extensive D∞∝N, see Eq. (7), which can be attributed
to the unconventionally high connectivity of the under-
lying graph of spin conﬁgurations. Although distances
behave diﬀerently in the single-particle and many-body
case, both allow to detect potential Anderson transitions
in real space or Hilbert space, respectively, either via a
divergent ξ or via Eq. (8).
In practice, and of particular importance for experi-
ments, we can considerably simplify the averaging pro-
cedure in Eq. (7), because it is possible to restrict the
analysis to one single initial state. For example, one may
rotate the local coordinate systems of the spins around
the x-axis to map |s0⟩to the fully polarized state |↑↑. . .⟩,
i.e., σz
l →s0
l σz
l . Sign ﬂips in Eq. (6) cancel, but the mag-
netic ﬁelds in Eq. (1) are mapped to hl →s0
l hl. If the
signs of hl and s0
l are uncorrelated, we obtain again an
Ising model with random ﬁelds. Starting from the polar-
ized state has the additional advantage that D|↑↑...⟩(t) is
a simple function of the mean magnetization, i.e., single-

MANY-BODY LOCALIZATION IN THE
QUANTUM ISING MODEL WITH POWER-LAW
INTERACTIONS
We now turn to a detailed analysis of the Hilbert-space
distance D(t). As we will show, based on the ndRG and
extensive numerical simulations we ﬁnd D(t)/N < 1/2
for any nonvanishing disorder strength, see Fig. 2, in-
dicating that the random Ising model with the consid-
ered power-law interactions is MBL. In the following, we
will ﬁrst summarize our main ﬁndings in Sec. IV A. In
Sec. IV B we will then discuss how we derived the Hilbert-
space distance on the basis of the ndRG, and afterwards
provide details about analytical explanations for the ab-
sence of ergodicity in the long-ranged regime of 0 ≤α ≤1
by analyzing the statistics of resonances in Sec. IV C.
A.
Results for the many-body localization length
In order to address quantum ergodicity and many-
body localization in disordered long-range Ising chains
for α ≤1, we use three complementary methods: exact
diagonalization, ndRG, as well as an analytical approach
on the basis of the statistics of resonances.
In Fig. 2, the main results are summarized. In that
ﬁgure, we show data at α = 0.5 for the Hilbert-space
distance D∞obtained within the ndRG as well as us-
ing exact diagonalization. For any nonvanishing disor-
der strength W/J > 0, we get D∞< N/2. According
to the ergodicity criterion in Eq. (8) this implies that

5
the system is MBL. Therefore, the autocorrelation func-
tion χ(t) preserves for all times an extensive memory of
the initial spin conﬁguration, a behavior that can be at-
tributed to the emergence of local conservation laws in
MBL systems12,16,49,50.
Let us focus ﬁrst on the exact diagonalization data in
Fig. 2a. The simulations have been performed on the ba-
sis of a Lanczos algorithm with full reorthogonalization51.
We have determined D∞by computing the time evolu-
tion of D(t) to large times Jt ∼O(104). Although for
increasing system size a tendency towards larger Hilbert-
space distances and therefore delocalization is visible, the
data for N = 12 and N = 16 are already quite close
with a weak ﬁnite-size dependence at moderate disorder
strength, but increasing ﬂuctuations for large disorder.
However, for a very weak random ﬁeld, the ﬁnite-size
dependence is much stronger. Here, a delocalized phase
might still be possible in the thermodynamic limit, al-
though the ndRG discussed in the following gives evi-
dence for a persistence of the MBL phase also in this
regime.
In Fig. 2b we show the results obtained using the
ndRG, which allows us to consider much larger system
sizes up to N = 1000. Moreover, for N = 16 we com-
pare ndRG data to exact diagonalization where one can
see that the agreement is very good over almost the full
range from strong to weak disorder. Deviations between
the ndRG, which is constructed for strong disorder, and
the ED are very small, especially when bearing in mind
that D∞involves a long-time limit of a nonequilibrium
quantum real-time evolution, which is a challenging task
for perturbative (RG) methods4. In this light, the very
good quantitative description of D(t) even in the long-
time limit underlines the capabilities of the ndRG. Com-
pared to ED, the ndRG can also be used to study very
large systems up to N = 1000 lattice sites.
The corresponding data is also shown in Fig. 2. As
one can see, for very large systems the ndRG tends to-
wards localization. In particular, we do not ﬁnd indica-
tions of a strong-coupling divergence which would other-
wise point towards the appearance of an ergodic phase.
Therefore, the ndRG data gives strong evidence for a
MBL phase. This is supported by analytical calculations
done in Sec. IV C where we show on the basis of the
statistics of resonances that the system is indeed noner-
godic in the regime 0 ≤α ≤1, independent of disorder
strength. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the many-body eigen-
states only occupy a very small fraction of all available
states although they are still extended through many-
body Hilbert space.
B.
Nonequilibrium dynamical renormalization
group (ndRG)
After having summarized the main results, we now dis-
cuss the ndRG implementation for the disordered long-
range Ising chain considered in this work. We state here
only its main ideas and refer to Appendices B and C for
methodological details. The ndRG provides an iterative
coarse-graining procedure for the full time-evolution op-
erator U(t), with the aim to construct an analytically
tractable representation of U(t) for interacting quan-
tum many-body systems.
As we have seen in Figs. 1
and 2, when benchmarking against exact diagonaliza-
tion, although the ndRG is constructed around the large-
disorder limit, its results match remarkably well also in
the region W/J = O(1).
Starting from the large-disorder limit W ≫J, the
ndRG eliminates the Ising couplings perturbatively on an
iterative basis. Its underlying idea is based on the prin-
ciple of scale separation: A spin subject to a large mag-
netic ﬁeld is energetically decoupled from the remainder
of the system. Following this reasoning, we can select the
spin in the ﬁeld with largest magnitude, say at site ℓ, and
remove it from the many-body dynamics by taking its in-
ﬂuence on the residual spins into account perturbatively.
As explained in Appendix B, this leads to renormalized
couplings J (r)

These equations bear a strong similarity to a Schrieﬀer–
Wolﬀtransformation to order (J/W)2 with, however, one
crucial diﬀerence: the right-hand side of the equations
involves the renormalized magnetic ﬁelds. As a conse-
quence, degeneracies with vanishing denominators are
lifted, greatly enhancing the stability of the scaling equa-
tions. Additionally, the Kac prescription, Eq. (2),36 en-
sures the extensivity of the spin-interaction contribution
to the total energy, rendering the ndRG well-controlled
even in the case of long-range interactions. In particular,
we do not ﬁnd any indications of a strong-coupling diver-
gence, which indicates that the ndRG is well-controlled
in the present scenario.
The RG equation (9c) for the couplings additionally
involves the spin projection σz
ℓof the eliminated spin.
This projection, after the RG step, is a constant of mo-
tion, so we can treat it as a c-number. As long as we
are in a nonergodic phase and the system retains a mem-
ory of the initial state, we can replace σz
ℓ→⟨σz
ℓ⟩by
its initial value, up to corrections that are of the order
(J/W)2. This means that within this prescription we can
a priori only describe the MBL phase of the model. How-
ever, the breakdown of the ndRG could potentially also
reveal an approach towards the MBL transition. Note
also that the renormalization introduces a randomness

6
in the couplings. The initial restriction to a randomness
in the ﬁeld terms is therefore not a crucial ingredient of
the considered model.
Storing the ﬁeld of the removed spin h(r)
ℓ
into memory,
calling it h∗
ℓ, we remove it from the dynamics. We then
repeat the RG step deﬁned by Eq. (9), choosing the next
spin with the (renormalized) ﬁeld of largest magnitude.
By successively eliminating all spins, the ndRG scheme
prescripes a unitary transformation U [see Eq. (B8)] to
a renormalized model, where all couplings between spins
are removed, U(t) = U †U∗(t)U, with U∗(t) = e−iH∗
0 t and
H∗
0 = P

The simple form of the resulting renormalized Hamil-
tonian allows for the calculation of the autocorrelation
function deﬁned in Eq. (6), as explained in detail in
Appendix C. Using a recently introduced scheme52 for
evaluating expectation values of local observables within
techniques such as the ndRG, one obtains for a single dis-
order realization, up to second order in the renormalized
coupling strengths J (r)

We numerically performed the ndRG to calculate
D∞= D(t →∞). As already summarized in Sec. IV A,
Figure 2 displays the results for one representative exam-
ple α = 0.5, but other values of α ≤1 give qualitatively
similar outcomes. This ndRG data compares remarkably
well with ED, which gives additional conﬁdence in the
validity of the ndRG approach. We attribute the relia-
bility of the ndRG to the structure of the RG equations
in Eqs. (9a-9c) which relies on a self-consistent deter-
mination of the renormalized Hamiltonian parameters.
In particular, potential resonances with small energy de-
nominators are lifted which leads to a substantial increase
in stability of the RG equations. The ndRG assumes that
there are not too many such resonances. As we will see
in the next Section, this is a well-justiﬁed assumption in
the range 0 ≤α ≤1 for all values of disorder.
C.
Statistics of resonances
Our ED and ndRG studies showed nonergodic behav-
ior of the model (1). We will now explain this ﬁnding
analytically for the parameter regime 0 ≤α ≤1 via the
statistics of resonances, which has proven valuable in the
context of single-particle localization phenomena19,53–55
and has recently been extended to the interacting many-
body context6,50,56,57. This will allow us to characterize
localization and ergodicity in the lattice of spin conﬁg-
urations.
For the moment, let us ﬁrst concentrate on
α = 0 where it has already been shown that the system
is many-body localized37. The results obtained for this
limit will also allow us to establish a many-body localized
phase in the entire regime 0 ≤α ≤1.
For J > 0, the eigenstates |˜s⟩= eS|s⟩are pertur-
batively connected to the J = 0 eigenstates via a uni-
tary transformation, whose generator S can be obtained
through a Schrieﬀer–Wolﬀtransformation58. To lowest
order in J /W, the amplitude AΛ connecting two con-
ﬁgurations along a given trajectory reads (see Appendix
A)
AΛ =
Λ
Y
ν=1
J /2
∆εν
.
(11)
The details about the trajectory enter through the energy
diﬀerences ∆εν = Es −Es between ‘neighboring’ conﬁg-
urations |s⟩and |s⟩, i.e., conﬁgurations connected by the
Ising interaction with Vs,s ̸= 0 in Eq. (3). The Ising in-
teraction involves spin ﬂips at two real-space sites l and
m. Thus, we have ∆εν = ±hl±hm, with signs depending
on whether the spins are ﬂipped from ↑to ↓or vice versa.
For uniformly distributed magnetic ﬁelds, hl ∈[−W, W],
the probability distribution for the magnitude of nearest-
neighbor amplitudes |A1| is
P(|A1|) =
2
Z2|A1|3 [Z|A1| −1] ,
Z = 4W
J ,
(12)
for |A1| > Z−1 and zero otherwise, see also Ref. 6. The
fraction of nearest-neighbor states which share a reso-
nance is given by the probability P1(C) = (ZC)−1[2 −
(ZC)−1] that the amplitude |A1| exceeds a given value
C, with C setting the threshold for resonances.
Since
J = J/N, we have Z = 4NW/J, implying P1(C) →0
for any ﬁxed C > 0 when N →∞which is indepen-
dent of the precise threshold value C. How this property
relates to ergodicity will be discussed below.
Although resonances between close generations are ex-
tremely sparse, we will now show that the eigenstates are
nevertheless highly extended. For multiple hopping pro-
cesses, the situation is in general much more diﬃcult than
for the hopping to the next generation analyzed above.
It is, however, possible to simplify the analysis substan-
tially through a controlled approximate mapping onto a
much simpler subgraph that can be solved analytically
as we will show now. Consider a ﬁrst hopping process
from a “root” site |s0⟩to one site |s⟩of generation 1.
From this particular |s⟩, there is one path back to the
root, there are 2(N −2) paths to the same generation,
and
 N−2
2

= (N −2)(N −3)/2 trajectories to the next
generation. In the thermodynamic limit N →∞, it is
therefore possible to only consider the latter paths, see
also Ref. 6. Extending the same argument to trajectories
with Λ > 2, one obtains an eﬀective directed graph in-
cluding only those trajectories that minimize the length
between the connected sites.
Such subgraphs are also
known in the context of the forward-scattering approx-
imation54,55,57, which is controlled by the perturbation

7
strength J/W 54,55. It is important to emphasize that in
the present context the mapping onto the subgraph is ad-
ditionally controlled by the large connectivity of the un-
derlying Hilbert space graph towards higher generations,
similar to Ref.6. As we will discuss below, for α > 1,
this mapping is not well-controlled, restricting the use
of this graph to α ≤1. For Λ →N/2 the connectiv-
ity towards higher generations becomes smaller, decreas-
ing the accuracy of the description via the subgraph. In
this case, as in the forward-scattering approximation, the
mapping still remains well-controlled due to the pertur-
bation strength. Notice that the graph used here is dif-
ferent from a Bethe lattice as used in Ref. 6.
On this reduced subgraph, it is possible to use a saddle-
point approximation for Λ ≫1 in order to determine the
probability PΛ(C) that the magnitude of the amplitude
AΛ exceeds a given C, yielding (see Appendix A)
PΛ(C) =
1
√
2πΛ

C log(Z)
2e log(Z)

Λ
,
(13)
for Z−Λ ≪C < 1. The probability P Λ that none of the
trajectories has an amplitude larger than C, see Ref. 6,
is P Λ(C) = [1 −PΛ(C)]nΛ ≈exp[−nΛPΛ(C)], where
nΛ = 2−ΛN!/(N −2Λ)! is the number of trajectories con-
necting the root to sites in generation Λ. Using Stirling’s
approximation, we obtain nΛ →[K(λ)]Λ for Λ, N ≫1
with λ = Λ/N and K(λ) = N 2(1 −2λ)2−1/λ/e2. Be-
cause nΛPΛ(C) ∝[2e log(Z)K(λ)/Z]Λ ∝[N log(N)]Λ,
we have P Λ(C) →0 for N →∞, i.e., there is at least one
trajectory and therefore one site in generation Λ that is
strongly connected to the root. With probability 1 each
eigenstate extends to arbitrary distance, but restricted
to a small fraction of the available states6,56, since P1(C)
vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.
We now generalize this analysis to the case 1 ≥α > 0.
The couplings Jν = Jlm appearing in the amplitudes
AΛ = Q
ν Jν/2∆εν now depend explicitly on the speciﬁc
spins that are ﬂipped along the trajectory. However, to
show that the system is still nonergodic, it suﬃces to
consider an upper bound for |AΛ|, obtained by replacing
Jlm →J by its nearest-neighbor value. Following the
same steps as above, this implies P1(C) →0 for N →∞,
because J decays as J/N 1−α for 0 < α < 1 and as
J/ log(N) at α = 1.
Summarizing, the statistics of resonances reveals the
structure of the eigenstates in the disordered long-range
Ising model and therefore its ergodicity properties. For
0 ≤α ≤1, resonances between nearest-neighboring spin
conﬁgurations are vanishingly sparse in the thermody-
namic limit because P1(C) →0 for N →∞.
Hence,
eigenstates occupy only a vanishing fraction of Hilbert
space. Therefore, they are nonergodic. But, remarkably,
eigenstates are still extended6,56 as there is always at
least one resonant trajectory connecting a root conﬁgu-
ration to one site in generation Λ with Λ ≫1. Interest-
ingly, localization in many-body Hilbert space is possi-
ble although single-particle excitations can delocalize in
real space for suﬃciently long-ranged interactions40,42.
In our model, we do not ﬁnd indications for a phase
where eigenstates are nonergodic and also localized as
has been observed for Cayley trees6. We attribute this
to the particular relation between the connectivity K of
our lattice, K ∝N 2, and the eﬀective disorder strength
Z ∝N. Thus, we always have that K ≫Z, a regime
which does not allow for states which are both nonergodic
and localized6.
The situation is more complex for α > 1, where, con-
trary to α ≤1, the couplings J do not decay as a function
of system size N. This scaling, however, is crucial for the
above analysis, preventing the use of the same methods.
In particular, the applicability of the forward scattering
approximation becomes much less controlled in this case
because higher-order processes can dominate over lower-
order processes as we will discuss now.
Consider, for
example, the coupling of a spin conﬁguration to a con-
ﬁguration in generation 1, where the two ﬂipped spins
in real space are at a distance of r. The corresponding
coupling amplitude is A1 = J /∆ε rα. The same conﬁg-
urations can also be coupled by second-order processes,
for example, one where ﬁrst the spins at position 0 and
r −d are ﬂipped, followed by a second hopping within
generation 1 involving the spins at r −d and r. The cor-
responding amplitude is A2 = J 2/∆ε1∆ε2 (r −d)αdα,
with ∆ε1,2 the energy diﬀerence of the ﬁrst and second
spin ﬂip processes. Let us consider the possibility that
the second-order process dominates, i.e., A2 > A1. This
leads to the condition r/d < cd/(cd −1) for r > d > 1,
with c = [N(α)∆ε1∆ε2/J∆ε]1/α. For α > 1, this condi-
tion can always be fulﬁlled whereas for α ≤1 this is not
the case, because then c →∞for N →∞. More pre-
cisely, for α ≤1 one obtains that r/d < cd/(cd −1) →1,
resulting in a contradiction with r > d > 1. In other
words, for α ≤1 second-order processes within gener-
ation 1 can be safely neglected in the thermodynamic
limit. This is a further justiﬁcation for the applicability
of the forward scattering approximation and the above
use of the reduced subgraph. For α > 1 instead, tak-
ing only the probability for ﬁrst-order resonances as a
criterion for ergodicity requires care. However, it is still
possible to address the delocalization of single-particle
excitations in real space on the basis of the ﬁrst-order
resonances40.

CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we have studied many-body localization
in Ising models with slowly decaying power-law interac-
tions in a disordered transverse ﬁeld, which are relevant
for experiments with polar molecules, Rydberg atoms,
and trapped ions.
We have presented numerical and
analytical calculations predicting an inﬁnite-temperature
many-body localized phase. Consequently, these systems
show nonergodic behavior throughout the entire spec-
trum.

8
Moreover, in Eq. (5), we have introduced an experi-
mentally accessible observable that quantiﬁes distances
in Hilbert space.
It can be seen as the analog of the
Anderson localization length in the many-body context
and thus allows one to experimentally access fundamental
properties of many-body localized phases. A straightfor-
ward sequence to measure it in a spin system would be:
(i) initialize all spins in the ↑state; (ii) time evolve under
one realization of the disordered model; (iii) measure the
mean magnetization; and (iv) average the results over
disorder realizations. This sequence is general and can
be exploited in other experimental contexts, simply by
inserting in the time evolution (ii) the appropriate disor-
dered many-body model.

Appendix A: Statistics of resonances
Ergodicity, i.e., delocalization in many-body Hilbert
space, is driven by the proliferation of resonances between
sites in Hilbert space6. In this section, we provide tech-
nical details about the statistics of resonances presented
in the main text. In the context of localization phenom-
ena, similar analyses have proven very valuable both for
Anderson19,53–55 and many-body localization6,50,56,57.
Our starting point is the Hilbert-space lattice de-
ﬁned by the spin conﬁgurations |s⟩= |s1, . . . , sN⟩with
sl = |↑⟩, |↓⟩.
Without the Ising coupling between the
spins (J = 0), the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) of the main text
becomes purely local and its eigenstates are the spin con-
ﬁgurations |s⟩. Within standard perturbation theory, for
nonzero spin interactions (J > 0), the lowest-order cor-
rection to the eigenstates connects states with Hamming
distance 2 that can be reached by ﬂipping two spins via
the interaction, i.e., states |s⟩and |s⟩where Vs,s ̸= 0 in
Eq. (2). For the statistics of resonances as given in main-
text Eq. (8), however, we are also interested in states sep-
arated by large Hamming distance, which is far beyond
low-order perturbation theory. In the following, we pro-
vide a general scheme for determining amplitudes for far
distant spin conﬁgurations in the disordered long-range
Ising chain.
For J > 0, the Ising Hamiltonian HIsing can be diago-
nalized approximately using a Schrieﬀer–Wolﬀtransfor-
mation58,

If |s⟩is an eigenstate of H0, then |˜s⟩= eS|s⟩is an approx-
imate eigenstate of HIsing. Expanding the exponential
eS, we get |s⟩= P∞
n=0 Sn|s⟩/n!, where Sn contains all
contributions of the order (J /W)n. For a given n, Sn|s⟩
can be decomposed into individual trajectories connect-
ing the conﬁguration |s⟩to other conﬁgurations. A spe-
ciﬁc trajectory reaching state |s′⟩will have the amplitude
AΛ = eiϕΛ

(A4)
The details of the particular trajectory are contained in
the combined index ν = (l, m), which keeps track of the
spins in real space that have been ﬂipped on the trajec-
tory, with Jν = Jlm and ∆εν = ±hl ± hm. The signs in
∆εν depend on whether the spins on sites l and m have
been ﬂipped from ↑to ↓or vice versa. These signs, as
well as the overall phase ϕΛ, however, will not be impor-
tant for what follows, because we will only be interested
in the magnitude of the objects AΛ.
Focusing ﬁrst on the case α = 0, we have that Jν = J ,
and randomness enters only via the energy denominators,
i.e., for the statistics of the amplitudes AΛ we need the
distribution DΛ of the denominators,
DΛ =

(A5)
Let us ﬁrst consider hopping processes between nearest-
neighboring Hilbert-space sites, i.e., Λ = 1. For a uni-
form distribution of hl ∈[−W, W], the probability dis-
tribution P(|D1|) for the absolute value |D1| can be cal-
culated straightforwardly, yielding P(|D1|) = (2|D1| −
1)/(2|D1|3). For the full amplitudes A1 = D1J /(2W),
one obtains
P(|A1|) =

Z = 4W
J ,
(A6)
the result quoted in Eq. (6) of the main text. For the
derivation, see also Ref. 6.

9
Importantly, for the considered trajectories in the de-
rived eﬀective graph of the main text, which include
only hopping processes that increase the generation, the
energy denominators are independent random variables.
Let us introduce the new variables xν = log(W/∆εν).
The probability distribution pΛ(X) for X = P
ν xν (i.e.,
eX ≡AΛ) is then obtained via Fourier transformation,

(2 + iµ)−2]. For Λ ≫1, one can use a saddle-point ap-

Appendix B: Nonequilibrium dynamical
renormalization group (ndRG)
In this Appendix, we present methodological details
for the nonequilibrium dynamical renormalization group
(ndRG)21. The ndRG provides a coarse-graining proce-
dure that establishes an analytically tractable represen-
tation of the full time-evolution operator
U(t) = T e−i
R t
0 dt′ H(t′)
(B1)
of complicated many-body problems.
This is achieved
by successively eliminating high-energy contributions,
thereby generating an eﬀective theory for the low-energy
degrees of freedom. In Eq. (B1), H(t) denotes the poten-
tially time-dependent Hamiltonian of the system, and T
is the time ordering prescription.
In the present case, the system is initially prepared in
a speciﬁc spin conﬁguration |s⟩, and we are interested in
the time evolution with the disordered long-range Ising
Hamiltonian
H(t > 0) = HIsing = H0 + V ,
(B2)
where H0 = P
i hiσz
i , and V = P
i<j Jijσx
i σx
j . The asso-
ciated time-evolution operator is U(t) = exp(−iHIsingt).
In the limit of strong disorder W ≫J, the largest en-
ergy scale will be the magnetic ﬁeld of largest magnitude,
located, say, at spin ℓ. It is then convenient to separate
the interactions that involve this spin, denoted by Vℓ,
from those which do not, V ℓ:
V = Vℓ+ V ℓ
Vℓ= σx
ℓ
X
m
Jℓmσx
m,
V ℓ= V −Vℓ,
(B3)
Following Ref. 21, the ndRG removes all couplings involv-
ing the spin ℓusing a unitary transformation eS(ℓ) on the
full time-evolution operator, U(t) = e−S(ℓ)U(ℓ)(t)eS(ℓ).
This transformation yields a renormalized model
U(ℓ)(t) = e−iH(ℓ)
Isingt.
(B4)
(Throughout this Appendix, we use a subindex to denote
the site of the spin ℓand a bracketed superindex to denote
the RG step where spin ℓis integrated out.) To second-
order accuracy, i.e., including terms up to O[(J/W)2],
the renormalized Hamiltonian H(ℓ)
Ising after this RG step
is given by

m denotes the renormalized free

termined by the equation

. (B7)
Using this transformation in Eq. (B5), one obtains the
RG equations for the ﬁelds and couplings given in Eq. (9).
We can now repeat the above RG scheme for the spin
with second largest magnetic ﬁeld amplitude (after renor-
malization), and proceed this way from high to low en-
ergies. Iteratively eliminating all couplings, one obtains

10
an analytically tractable representation of the time evo-
lution operator,
U(t) = U †U∗(t)U ,
U = T (ℓ) exp
 X

S(ℓ)

(B8)
where U∗(t) = e−iH∗
0 t is diagonal. The prescription T (ℓ)
denotes energy ordering, with S(ℓ) to the right for spins
in larger ﬁelds, analogous to common time ordering.
Note that the validity of the scale separation underly-
ing this ndRG algorithm assumes that there are few res-
onances, i.e., the dominant energy scale is hl rather than
J/|hl −hm|. Close to a transition to ergodicity, such res-
onances proliferate, which would lead to a breakdown of
the ndRG procedure. As the stability of the numerical
algorithm demonstrates, in the parameter ranges consid-
ered in this article the inﬂuence of such resonances is
small, and ndRG always predicts a nonergodic behavior.
Appendix C: Hilbert-space distance using ndRG
Within the above ndRG procedure, observables can
conveniently be evaluated by the scheme introduced in
Ref. 52, which we outline now for the speciﬁc case of
the two-time correlator as deﬁned in Eq. (6), χs0(t) =
N −1 P
m ⟨s0|σz
m(t)σz
m|s0⟩≡N −1 P

the

Eq. (B8), we can write
χs0,m(t) =

s0| U †U†
∗(t)U σz

(C1)
To evaluate this equation, it is convenient to perturba-
tively eliminate the energy-ordering prescription T (ℓ) ap-
pearing in U by using a Magnus expansion:
U = exp
 X

S(ℓ) + O[(J/W)2]
!
≈exp

.
(C2)
In principle, for consistency, terms of order (J/W)2
should be taken into account. In the expectation value
⟨s0|σz
m(t)σz
m|s0⟩, however, they can yield ﬁnite contribu-
tions only if two terms of order (J/W)2 collaborate, so
that the corresponding correction to the ﬁnal result is of
the order (J/W)4. This is beyond the desired accuracy of
the present calculation. Notice that this argument only
holds for initial states that are eigenstates of H0.
The summation over S(ℓ) involves any given spin m
several times: it gets repeatedly renormalized by S(ℓ)
m
[see Eq. (9)] until it becomes the spin in the ﬁeld with
largest magnitude. It is then removed from the many-
body dynamics and obtains a ﬁnal renormalization from
all remaining spins via S(m). For the following, it will,
therefore, be useful to split P
ℓS(ℓ) into the part that
contains the spin m, which we denote as Sm, and the
part that does not, Sm = P
ℓS(ℓ) −Sm.
Using the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀformula, these
two contributions can be separated, yielding
U = Um Um ,
Um ≡exp (Sm) ,

(C3)
up to corrections that again only contribute to the ﬁ-

In this expectation value, terms of the type

†, Um
†i
contribute only if they appear pair-wise, so neglecting
them gives again corrections only of order (J/W)4. Thus,
we can commute Um

it, and write

Here, we understand Um(t) = U†
∗(t)UmU∗(t) as the
time evolution under the renormalized Hamiltonian H∗
0,
which, being diagonal, is easily computed following
Heisenberg’s equations of motion.
Finally, a cumulant expansion allows evaluating the

The periodically oscillating terms giving the time dy-

In Fig. 1 and 2, we show the ndRG results for the
disorder-averaged many-body localization length for two
values of α. Although the present ndRG is a priori for-
mulated for strong disorder, it agrees remarkably well to
ED down to W/J ≲2, and for α = 0.5 even over the
entire range of disorder strengths. This good agreement
gives conﬁdence in the validity of the ndRG approach.
