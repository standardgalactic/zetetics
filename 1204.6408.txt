ABSTRACT 
We developed a website for kids where they can share new as 
well as remixed animations and games, e.g., interactive music 
videos, which they created on their smartphones or tablets using a 
visual “LEGO-style” programming environment called Catroid. 
Online communities for children like our website have unique 
requirements, and keeping the commitment of kids on a high level 
is a continuous challenge. For instance, one key motivator for kids 
is the ability to entertain their friends. Another success factor is 
the ability to learn from and cooperate with other children. In this 
short position paper we attempt at identifying the requirements for 
the success of such an online community, both from the point of 
view of the kids as well as of their parents, and at finding ways to 
make it attractive for both.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The use of mobile phones and tablets is spreading rapidly over the 
world. This trend is not limited to adults. In industrial countries a 
growing number of children have their own mobile phone. E.g., 
already in 2010 more than 50% of German children aged between 
6 and 13 years had their own mobile phone. Between the age of 
12 and 13 years it was 90% [5]. Similar results can be seen in 
Asian countries like Japan, Korea, China or India [1]. An 
increasing number of children have access to a mobile internet 
connection allowing them to be online whenever and wherever 
they want. In Japan almost 70% of the children with mobile 
phones use them to access the Internet. In China and Korea the 
percentage is more than 30% [1] and in Germany 15% of the kids 
have a mobile internet connection [5]. These percentages are 
increasing quickly due to decreasing costs and the availability of 
flat rates. Other popular activities are making calls, writing 
messages, taking photos, and recording and exchanging videos.  
The trend reflected in these statistics shows that the number of 
potential users of Catroid1, our visual “LEGO-style” programming 
environment for smartphones and tablets, and of its online 
community website2 for children, grows quickly and will rise even 
more in the near future.

Our Catroid programming environment makes it easy for kids 
from the age of 8 to create interactive content such as multimedia 
animations or games directly on their smartphones without 
requiring previous knowledge about software development. The 
aim of our software is to empower children to gather their first 
programming experiences in a playful way. This paper focuses

only on online community websites such as the one for Catroid 
projects that foster the cooperation between children and support 
them to get inspired and learn from others. The mobile visual 
programming environment Catroid itself is described in [9]. 
2. RELATED WORK 
Our online community website is inspired by (but otherwise 
unrelated to) the thriving online community [3,7] for Scratch4, the 
latter also being a visual programming language for children but 
in contrast to Catroid intended to be used on PCs or Laptops only. 
Catroid is inspired by Scratch but has many independent features 
related, among others, to the different possibilities and constraints 
of smartphones, e.g., position sensors, multi-touch screens, or 
small screen sizes, and has been developed independently of 
Scratch. Other online community websites supporting and 
encouraging the sharing of interactive animations and/or games 
created by kids include those associated with Nintendo’s Wario 
Ware D.I.Y.5 that runs on portable Nintendo DSi game consoles, 
Microsoft’s Kodu6 for the Xbox 360 game console, Flipnote 
Hatena7 also for Nintendo DSi game consoles, and Game Maker8 
for PCs or Laptops. YouTube can also be seen as a platform to 
share user contributed multimedia content though it is not 
primarily oriented towards children and the contributed content 
cannot be made interactive. 
3. GOALS 
The goals of this paper are to identify unique requirements of 
online communities for children and to find success factors for 
such online communities of young creative people. To make such 
an online community website successful it is important that on the 
one hand it is highly attractive for kids and on the other hand does 
not cause any concerns from their parents. Thus we identify the 
unique requirements of such a site also from the parents’ point of 
view.  
4. SUITABILITY FOR CHILDREN, AND 
PARENTAL CONCERNS 
One important issue when creating a website for children is how 
to handle inappropriate content. 16% of German children who 
were interviewed reported that they stumbled upon sites which 
were – in their own opinion – inappropriate for children. More 
than half of that inappropriate content was related to sex and 
about 20% to some form of violence. 11% have been in situations 
where they felt unpleasant or were afraid while visiting a website 
[5]. Looking at the parental concerns about their child’s mobile 
phone usage shows that worries about inappropriate content is in 
the top three concerns together with overuse and cost of bills [1].  
We hope to allay concerns about overuse by explaining how our 
software fosters both creativity as well as the mastering of 
programming skills and can be used as an educational tool for 
almost any curricular topic. To reduce the risk of exceeding the 
limit of one’s data plan, which without an adequate flat rate could 
quickly lead to costly phone bills, we also clearly display the size 
of projects both before down- as well as before uploading them. 
Children are sensibilized to download volumes because of other 
content they download to their phones, but the increasing trend 
towards flat rates also contributes to alleviating associated risks.

sharing-released/

To protect children from inappropriate content we take multiple 
measures. We immediately reject inappropriate content which is 
detectable automatically by filtering project titles and descriptions 
as well as comments and nicknames for cuss words. For 
inappropriate content not detected by the first method, e.g., 
inappropriate images, we make use of the power of social 
communities. We place a special report-as-inappropriate button on 
each project’s details page giving users the possibility to actively 
take care of the community. Content reported as inappropriate 
stays hidden until an administrator has reviewed it. These 
measures are common and used on many websites which deal 
with user generated content. By having to give a reason why a 
project is reported as inappropriate this method “also helps 
engage young people in thinking about their own moral 
reasoning” [7]. 
5. MINIMIZE BARRIERS – MAXIMIZE 
COMMITMENT 
Seeing the impact of the participation and getting reactions from 
others are crucial points when participating in an online 
community. This fact applies even more if the participants are 
children. Keeping the commitment to our community on a high 
level requires continuous effort. It begins with keeping the 
barriers of joining and using the community as low as possible. 
We aim at making this possible by minimizing the required steps 
for registration (participation without registration is also possible) 
and making the boundary between the app and the community 
fluid. These measures are even more important as we target 
mobile devices.  
Another challenge is to encourage participation and get a high 
percentage of active content contributors. Zuckerman investigated 
the Israeli Scratch community and explained that participation can 
be increased by certain design features of the community website 
[10]. One of the design features we focus on is the arrangement of 
projects. For example a project not clearly showing up on the 
“newest projects” page in one’s browser right after one has 
uploaded a project can discourage children to participate further. 
A reason why a project disappears too quickly could be simply 
because there are too many uploads at the same time. We aim at 
solving this by only showing a set of projects which are 
geographically related to the website visitor and by ensuring that 
one’s own latest project is included in one’s view of the webpage, 
for a certain time and until one accesses the page for the third 
time. Thus, e.g., a child in Korea will not see projects from Russia 
when viewing the “newest projects” page, and a girl in Shanghai 
will see her newly uploaded animation at the top of other new 
projects from her region in the first few minutes after she 
uploaded it even though these other projects might be newer. This 
could in the future be extended to showing this project also 
preferentially for a longer period of time to other children that 
viewed projects of this user before, thus increasing the chances 
that local or remote friends of a contributor will be able to see the 
project. Alerting users of new projects from their friends would 
also support this.   
The suggestions page for Scratch9 where users can request 
features for future versions of the online community website is a 
good source to find out what the Scratch community likes or 
dislikes. One issue frequently pointed out is that projects often 
stay the same on the “what the community is loving, viewing, and 
remixing” pages which means that the projects featured there have 
a much higher chance to get viewed, loved, and remixed again. 
                                                                 
9 http://suggest.scratch.mit.edu/ 

The projects are distributed such that few top-placed projects are 
viewed, loved, and remixed extremely often. In contrast the 
majority consists of the less known projects. We have to focus 
also on projects located in this long tail. One simple method to 
realize this is a special “unknown projects” page with some 
randomly selected less popular projects which are presented for a 
defined period of time. Another possibility is to select the projects 
for the “what the community is loving, viewing, and remixing” 
pages randomly from a greater set of projects with the size of the 
set depending on the overall number of projects. Another method 
to increase the visibility of projects that are not in the top 
categories is to use automatic recommendation techniques as 
known from, e.g., Amazon’s web shop, for instance by linking 
from each project to other projects that children viewed who also 
viewed the current project. This also helps in matching children 
with their particular interests and boosts the value of the projects 
in the parts of the long tail that are far away from the most popular 
projects, especially in combination with a search feature allowing 
to find projects based on keywords in their title, description, and 
comments. Other methods are the possibility for children to 
compile their own lists that can be made public, much like user 
contributed lists of one’s favorite books on the websites of 
Amazon or movie lists on the Internet Movie Database. Such 
behavior increases the number of projects that can easily be 
discovered by browsing, thus leading to more satisfied users and a 
greater participation rate.    
6. STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
ONE’S PEERS – COLLABORATION AND 
REMIXING 
Manovich is citing Barb Dybwad when he writes “[…] the most 
interesting aspects of Web 2.0 are new tools that explore the 
continuum between the personal and the social, and tools that are 
endowed with a certain flexibility and modularity which enables 
collaborative remixability – a transformative process in which the 
information and media we’ve organized and shared can be 
recombined and built on to create new forms, concepts, ideas, 
mashups and services” [4]. It is an aim of our work to encourage 
children not only to create their own programs but to understand, 
learn from, and build on work of their peers. We want to help 
them to understand that collaboration and building on other 
people’s work can lead to better results. They are enticed and 
encouraged to remix and improve projects of others. All projects 
uploaded to our online community website are open source and 
published under a free software license. This concept of remixing 
is also a core idea behind Scratch with currently around 60,000 
remixes uploaded per month10 [7]. YouTube started to encourage 
the remixing of videos published under a creative commons 
license at the beginning of June 201111 which shows the growing 
support of the remixing concept in other major online 
communities. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to make young 
people understand the principles of remixing and open source. 
Research regarding the responses to remixing in the Scratch 
community state that a significant number of children react 
negatively on remixes of their work, and some of them complain 
about plagiarism [2]. Automatic attribution of remixes and 
visualization of project genealogies do help but are not enough: 
E.g., children in the Scratch community to a high degree prefer 
credit given to them in a non-automatic, explicit way by the 
                                                                 
10 http://stats.scratch.mit.edu/ 
11 http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2011/06/youtube-and-
creative-commons-raising.html 
author of a remix of their original project [8]. Following a 
suggestion of Monroy-Hernández et al. [6,8] and to increase the 
acceptance of remixing, we design our system in a way that 
invites explicit manual crediting by providing an additional field 
for credits when uploading a remixed project. Additionally we 
provide a wiki and a forum for discussing the issues behind 
remixing, plagiarism, copyright and copyleft, and free open 
source software. These can be accessed directly when uploading a 
new or a remixed project, with contextually differing explanations 
for both cases. All this information should as much as possible be 
available in the children’s language. Our project currently support 
several languages, with speakers of English, Mandarin, 
Cantonese, Hindi, Arabian, Japanese, Russian, German, Turkish, 
French, Urdu, Rumanian, and Malaysian in the team, and we use 
the crowd-sourcing software Pootle12 to allow, e.g., parents to 
correct and/or add translations and new languages. 
7. FOSTERING INTERNATIONAL 
COLLABORATION 
Especially when designing an international website for children, 
supporting multiple languages is extremely important. Compared 
to translating a static website text, it is quite a challenge to support 
different languages throughout all user generated text. We plan to 
use the Google Translate API to optionally offer an automatic 
translation of project titles, project descriptions, comments, as 
well as text used inside of projects. Additionally to that we plan to 
support children in communicating with their foreign peers by 
introducing a simple template-based system for comments similar 
to the system used on Club Penguin13. Through this method kids 
can build comments out of a set of templates of common phrases. 
These templates are available in each supported language, again 
editable and extendable by the crowd-sourcing part of our project, 
and hence the most popular type of comments can potentially be 
displayed in the children’ own language. All these methods 
further foster the cooperation among kids as the number of 
children that can easily communicate with each other is scaled up 
to a much larger portion of the world’s population. 
8. INTEGRATING SOCIAL NETWORKS 
Over the last years social networks have become increasingly 
popular among children. The percentage of German children 
between the age of 6 and 13 who are using an online community 
at least once a week has grown from 16% in 2008 to 43% in 2010 
[5]. 65% of Japanese and 27% of Chinese children who have a 
mobile internet connection use it to read messages and updates on 
their friend’s profiles on social network sites [1]. Integrating 
support for popular social networks in a community like ours 
creates great opportunities both for the kids as well as for the 
popularity of our community. One key motivator for children to 
participate is the ability to entertain other kids and see their 
reactions, e.g., through their online feedback comments. By 
giving them the chance to easily promote their new projects on 
their social network profile they can reach an even wider 
audience. At the same time our community gets more attention by 
kids who usually might not be initially attracted. 
A note on legal aspects: Even though laws regarding the 
involvement of children under, e.g., the age of 13 may vary from 
country to country, a website with social network features needs 
to be aware about legal issues, must take appropriate steps to 
protect its members, and must allow parents or legal guardians to

exercise their rights. Examples from well established social 
networks such as Nickelodeon’s neopets14 can serve as best-
practice examples. 
9. RESULTS 
In summary, we have tentatively identified and partly 
implemented into our community website the following factors 
we deemed critical for the success of such a community: 
 
Minimize barriers for joining and using the community. 
 
The website is available in the children’s native languages. 
 
The explanation of remixing and open source concepts must 
be easily understandable by children.  
 
Security aspects and filtering inappropriate content. 
 
Avoiding parental concerns like phone overuse, high costs, 
and inappropriate content. 
 
Clearly trigger the reactions of others to the project’s original 
author in order to foster motivation and participation, in 
particular regarding remixes. 
 
Make the discovery of other projects of one’s areas of 
interests as easy and intuitive as possible. 
It must be noted that clearly the popularity of such a website is 
strongly influenced by the attractiveness of the associated 
software with which one creates the animations and games that 
can then be shared on the website, and vice versa.  
10. CONCLUSION 
Today kids are increasingly online whenever and wherever they 
are – mainly communicating, playing, surfing, or consuming 
audio or video using their mobile phones. Inspired by Scratch we 
developed a tool that allows children to become creators of their 
own interactive mobile content instead of just being consumers. 
The main difference to other similar systems is the mobile 
character of our system that allows children to use our system 
almost at any time and place, with the added possibilities 
available through the use of built-in sensors and actuators such as 
gyro-sensors or GPS and the challenge posed by the small 
screens, the strong encouragement of remixing and sharing, and 
the free open source availability of our software. We believe that 
this allows us to empower children to effectively create, and share 
their projects with their peers.  
The ultimate measure of success of our website is the rate of 
growth of the popularity of the combined system. This would 
allow us to achieve our vision of empowering all children of the 
world to master the skills required to express themselves naturally 
and easily through programming the devices they carry with them 
at all times. We believe that this is an important endeavor, both 
for socio-economical as well as for deeper philosophical reasons, 
as programming can be seen as an automation of human rational 
thinking.
