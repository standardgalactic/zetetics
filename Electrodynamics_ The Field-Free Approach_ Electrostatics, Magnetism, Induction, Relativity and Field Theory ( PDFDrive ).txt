Preface
The intent of this book is to serve as an undergraduate textbook in electrodynamics
at a basic or advanced level.
The objective is to attain a general understanding of electrodynamic theory and
its basic experiments and phenomena in order to form a foundation for further
studies in the engineering sciences as well as in modern quantum physics.
The outline of the book is based on the following principles:
• Introduce each phenomenon with relevant and complete experiments
• Focus on experiments and observations accessible to the student
• Base the theory on the concept of force and mutual interaction
• Present electrodynamics using the same principles as in the preceding mechanics
course
• Treat electric, magnetic and inductive phenomena cohesively with respect to
force, energy, dipoles and material
• Aim at explaining that theory of relativity is based on the magnetic effect
• Introduce ﬁeld theory after the basic phenomena have been explored in terms of
force.
Overview
The book starts by considering the different types of forces that occur between
electric charges. These may be directly related to their motion, i.e. charges at rest, in
uniform motion and in acceleration. The forces, known as electric, magnetic and
inductive, are treated cohesively and formulated through observations and mea-
surements. The subsequent chapters are more or less direct applications of the force
formulas.
Chapter 3 introduces the energy concept as a direct consequence of force through
the principle of work. The inductive force is then utilized to derive magnetic
vii

energy. Neumann’s formula for inductance is fully derived and used to express
magnetic energy.
Chapter 4 covers macroscopic systems whose characteristics are obtained
through a summation of mutual interactions between inﬁnitesimal elements of
charge. Calculation techniques for capacitance and inductance are introduced and
shown to be useful concepts in case the system is homogeneous.
Chapters 5 and 6 deal with the conductor and electric circuits which constitute
the experimental environment from which electrodynamics was developed and
technical applications originated. The microscopic description of electric conduc-
tion, the origin of resistance and its relation to heat are treated ﬁrst. Then the
resonance circuit which includes the other two circuit components, capacitance and
inductance, is introduced.
Chapter 7 introduces electric and magnetic dipoles, which are signiﬁcant con-
cepts since nature generally may be described in terms of such objects. The
expressions for electric and magnetic dipole–dipole interaction energies are then
central to providing both force and torque.
Chapter 8 investigates how different electrically and magnetically neutral
materials respond to electric and magnetic inﬂuences. It is then assumed that the
material is composed of dipoles. The material parameters are introduced and
techniques for measuring them are described. A mathematically rigorous treatment
of the dipole, or generally multipole, interactions is presented in the accompanying
Appendices A and B.
In Chap. 9, it is shown conceptually how the magnetic and inductive dynamics
arise as motional consequences of the electric force assuming that interactions take
time; they are mediated at the speed of light. Alternatively, one may utilize the
knowledge of electric and magnetic forces to derive the speed of light. In a special
case both the magnetic force and the Faraday-Henry’s law of induction are derived.
It is also shown how electromagnetic dynamics is related to relativity, using the fact
that magnetism is the motional consequence on which the special theory of rela-
tivity is based. Since we build the theory upon the concept of force the material is
unique to this book. Chapter 9 also introduces Lorentz transformation in the form of
a tutorial. Prerequisites of Chap. 9 are only Chaps. 1–3, thus these four chapters
may form a concise course in basic electrodynamics and its relation to relativity.
In Chap. 10, electromagnetic ﬁeld theory is introduced and Maxwell's equations
formulated. The ﬁelds are indeed already deﬁned by the force formulas, but
expressed in Maxwell’s equations in terms of their divergence and curl. This is
motivated by showing that the boundary conditions of the ﬁelds are then deﬁned.
Using the ﬁelds, the Poynting vector may be formulated corresponding to the power
transported from an electrodynamic system.
An important feature of this book is thus that ﬁeld theory is introduced after the
physical phenomena that constitute electrodynamics have been described, inter-
preted and formulated in terms of fundamental forces.
In Chap. 11, antenna theory is introduced using the principle of retarded inter-
actions, i.e. taking into account that interactions take time. The small loop and the
small wire antennas are treated assuming current is uniform and varies harmonically

with time. Furthermore, the antenna array is discussed. The basic principles of
retarded interactions and array effects are thus developed and may then be applied
to natural oscillators as are found in nature. In this way, the reﬂection law, the
refraction law and the phenomenon of Brewster reﬂection are derived and fully
explained. The power delivered by an antenna is also analysed using the Poynting
vector derived in a previous chapter.
Appendix D contains solutions to the exercises appearing in the book.
Prerequisites and Target Audience
Although electrodynamics is described in this book from its ﬁrst principles, prior
knowledge of about one semester of university studies in mathematics and physics
is required, including vector algebra, integral and differential calculus as well as a
course in mechanics, treating Newton’s laws and the energy principle. The target
groups are teachers, engineering and physics students as well as professionals in the
ﬁeld, e.g. high-school teachers and employees in the telecom industry. Also
chemistry and computer science students may beneﬁt from the book.
Study Tips
Learning physics inevitably implies active involvement, especially in problem-
solving and experimental studies. We recommend that the discussed experiments
also be implemented in practice, not least to avoid tendencies to abstraction.
Some of the exercises, marked with an asterisk, are included in the theory of the
book and need to be solved before the chapter that follows them. The exercises
marked with a ‘C’ are more challenging and normally not suitable for independent
problem solving.
A solution manual is included in Appendix D.
Website
The book has a website where you will ﬁnd reader comments, recommended
Internet links, videos on relevant experiments/phenomena, further exercises and
suggested laboratory work. Please consult the publisher’s website to obtain the

Acknowledgment
I want to express my gratitude to all students who contributed so much to the
courses I have given over the years, including everything from basic and advanced
electromagnetic courses to theory of relativity and application courses in Antenna
and Microwave engineering at different levels in different study programs. The
reﬂections, comments and questions I have received from them have been of crucial
importance for my own development and the genesis of this book. I would also like
to thank my colleagues for many intense and fruitful discussions on Physics in
general and its role in society. Many interesting conversations with lecturers Göran
Nordström on the subject’s didactics and Peter Johansson on the connection
between relativity and electrodynamics have been indispensable for me. The latter
coined the term ‘motional consequence’ which is diligently used in this book. Many
thanks to Dr. Jenny Ivarsson for a thorough scientiﬁc review of a ﬁrst version of this
book and to engineering student Nicklas Bjärnhall Prytz for indispensable advice on
pedagogical issues as well as for making this book readable in English.
This book was originally published in Swedish and is available from its pub-
lisher Studentlitteratur. I appreciate all their support during the work, in particular
with the drawing of the ﬁgures.
Finally, I would like to thank the Springer staff for all their support during the
translation and revision of the book.

Chapter 1
Basic Principles
I think the facts leave no doubt that the very mightiest among
the chemical forces are of electric origin. The atoms cling to their
electric charges, and opposite electric charges cling to each other.
Hermann von Helmholtz, 1881
Electrodynamicsisthetopiconwhichmostofphysicsisbased.Thephysicssubtopics
such as mechanics, wave motion, thermodynamics, atomic physics and so on all have
their origin in the electric force. Pressure and temperature, sound, material bending,
winds, atomic and molecular structure etc. are basically the effects of interactions
between electric charges, together with all our senses and our physiology in its
entirety, including the genetic code. Observations beyond the senses are made with
instruments whose design is based exclusively on electrodynamics. So when physi-
cists study subatomic dynamics and discover two other types of interactions, the
strong nuclear force that holds nucleons together and the weak atomic force causing
fusion and radioactive decay, this is done with senses and instruments whose function
is based on the electric force.
Electrodynamics is, together with gravity, the force controlling everyday life. One
major issue of physics is whether these two forces have a common origin. Rephrased:
is there a relationship between mass and charge; could it be that the one is generated
dynamically from the other? For those who are interested in basic research, issues
of this nature are particularly favourable for fruitful research projects.
Also gravity is experienced through the electric force. As you read this, you
may sit in a chair and feel the so-called normal forces, which are electric and arise
indirectly via your weight. But when gravity acts alone, such as in a free fall, it is
not experienced; you are ‘weightless’.
Electrodynamics is based on the concept of electric charge, which has its origin
in the electrons and protons of the atom and is the source of the electromagnetic
force. All macroscopic charge is composed of these elementary charges and the
attraction between them is the condition for the bonded system known as the atom.
Consequently, also molecules are formed through the electric interaction.
Throughout this book the mutual interaction between charged objects is empha-
sized. These appear ‘pairwise’, i.e. they interact two by two, according to Newton’s

Basic Principles
fundamental laws of nature. The dynamics of nature is then a sum of individual
pairwise interactions. This summation requires knowledge of the interaction between
any two fundamental items such as two electrons, both at rest and in general motion.
In electrodynamics there is a good, although not complete, knowledge about this
force, which in the latter case, moving charges, essentially has been observed in
closed conductors.
As a complement to the force view of nature, physics may be described by the
energy concept, deﬁned through the pairwise interaction via the concept of work.
The result of work is stored energy U in the system (also known as potential energy).
Force and energy are intimately connected via the energy principle from which force
F arises as an energy minimization:
¯F = −∇U
(1.1)
i.e. force is the negative gradient of the stored energy U. This principle is one cor-
nerstone of physics. Force is in turn deﬁned by Newton’s laws of motion:
¯F = d
dt (m¯v)
(1.2)
i.e. force is the time derivative of momentum. Formula (1.2) also deﬁnes inertial
mass which is a measure of an object’s resistance to motional change. Furthermore,
the scientiﬁc deﬁnition of time and space originates from this formula.
Force and energy form the core of physics. Since energy is a scalar it is com-
putationally advantageous to ﬁrst obtain this quantity and then to use the energy
principle (1.1) to achieve the desirable force vector. In this book, this technique is
used extensively and a prior knowledge in the two concepts is essential.

Chapter 2
Electrodynamic Force
Electric and magnetic forces. May they live for ever, and never
be forgot, if only to remind us that the science of
electromagnetics, in spite of the abstract nature of its theory,
involving quantities whose nature is entirely unknown at the
present, is really and truly founded on the observations of real
Newtonian forces, electric and magnetic respectively.
Oliver Heaviside, 1900
In this chapter the force between charges at rest, in uniform motion, and in
acceleration will be formulated. These are termed electric, magnetic and induc-
tive respectively. A minimum set of experiments will be introduced through which
the forces may be studied in detail. From the measurements the force formulas are
deduced and expressed in terms of the fundamental entities, i.e. charge and its motion.
It must not be forgotten, however, that force formulas in general are strictly valid
only for the experimental conditions under which they were deduced. New phenom-
ena are therefore expected at higher speeds of the charges as well as at a smaller
distance scale than what is valid for the experiments discussed here. These frontiers
of physics are denoted theory of relativity and quantum mechanics respectively for
which the classical electrodynamic theory is the basis.
2.1 Electric Charges at Rest–Electric Force
Macroscopically electric charged objects arise apparently in different ways. It is
generally, however, a matter of separating unlike elementary charges from each other,
usually electrons from their atoms. A simple way to generate electricity is by friction.
Thunderclouds, for example, are formed at large temperature differences between
wet air masses which create strong air currents whereby friction occurs between the
water droplets. Electrons are then transported from one molecule to another, giving
rise to an imbalance counteracted by nature. This reaction is known as electric force.
Similarly, an electric imbalance occurs when different materials are rubbed against
each other, for instance a cloth on an amber stone.

Fig. 2.1 The torsion balance. The left ball is attached to a rod which in turn is mounted to the thin
vertical thread. The right ball is ﬁxed at a certain position. The balls can be charged for example
by allowing a charged plastic rod touching the balls. When the left-hand ball repels it will cause
the vertical wire to rotate and via its torsion constant K the acting force can be determined from
the rotational angle θ. The size of the equipment is illustrated by means of the matchbox
The word electric is derived from the ancient Greek word for amber,1 which the
ﬁrst recorded studies on this phenomenon revolve around. In the late 1700s Coulomb
studied these forces in a systematic manner. By means of a torsion balance, Fig.2.1,
the force between small objects could be determined for varying distance R and
charge q. The latter was varied by allowing a charged object to touch another identical
uncharged object under the assumption that the excess charge is then distributed
equally between the objects. The amount of charge is not directly accessible but
deﬁned by the force that arises.
This force, where the charged objects initially are at rest, is called electric or elec-
trostatic. The measurement can be carried out using for example Pasco’s equipment
in the ﬁgure. It is difﬁcult to achieve a precision better than 20%, so it is reasonable
to ask how Coulomb managed to carry out his experiments at such a precision that
the law which he formulated in the eighteenth century is still valid today:
¯F1→2 =
q1q2
4πε0R2 ˆR
(2.1)
which is the force on object 2 caused by object 1, Fig.2.2.
ˆR is a unit vector which indicates the direction of the distance vector pointing
towards the affected charge. ε0 is a natural constant called the electric permittivity.
The force on charge 1 is opposite in direction but equal in magnitude. By observation,
the electric force is known to be either repulsive or attractive, a fact that is taken into
account by introducing signs of the charges (a mathematical miracle). Science his-
torians suspect that Coulomb never completely veriﬁed this formula experimentally
but copied the formula of Newton’s law of gravitation, basically replacing mass with
charge.

Nevertheless, the Coulomb force formula is one of the most important discoveries
in physics, well-proven over time with different methods. Note that the force formula,
like Newton’s gravitational force, deals with pairwise interactions. In order to obtain
force and energy for general systems, the pairwise forces between its constituents
mustbesummed.Thisusuallyrequiresintegrationasthenumberofchargesissolarge
that a macroscopic object may be considered as consisting of charged inﬁnitesimal
elements, i.e. a continuous charge distribution. More about this in Chap.4.
The unit of charge is a Coulomb whose magnitude is deﬁned from formula (2.1).
2.2 Uniform Motion–Magnetic Force
Knowledge of electric charges in motion originates mainly from studies of current-
carrying conductors. However, a full understanding requires the study of free charges
in motion, such as in an electron tube or a particle accelerator.
To describe the effect of uniform motion, both parallel and perpendicular relative
motion must be examined where the latter case requires one party to consist of free
charges such as an electron beam. These motional effects should be regarded as a
correction to the Coulomb force (2.1), known as magnetic for historical reasons. The
word originates from ancient Greece, referring to the city where magnetic stones
were found. Today, however, magnetism is known to be about electric charges in
motion, explored and systematised using basically the current-carrying conductor.
2.2.1 Electric Current
In principle, an electric current may be generated in a conductor by bringing a charged
object to its proximity. The conduction electrons in the metal, which can move almost
freely, will then be put into motion. By means of a battery, i.e. a voltage source (see
Chap.3), the current can be maintained in a closed conductor.
The term ‘closed conductor’ refers to a conductor structure as a closed path where
conduction electrons by means of a battery are moving in a closed path, i.e. a circuit.

Electrodynamic Force
The battery voltage can typically be varied and because the voltage is proportional
to current, described by Ohm’s law (see Chap.5), different strengths of the current
may be obtained. Alternatively, for a given voltage, current may be varied by the
diversion into different branches of a circuit. Current I corresponds to the amount
of charge that passes an area A per unit time:
I = nqvA
(2.2)
where n is the number of charges per volume, q their individual charge and v its
velocity, so-called drift velocity in a conductor, see also Chap.5. The velocity v is
parallel to the normal of surface A. The current direction is deﬁned by the motional
direction of positive charges, so that the direction of current in a conductor is opposite
the direction of the electron drift velocity.
The unit of current is thus coulomb/second, usually referred to as Ampère.
2.2.2 Measurement of Parallel Motion
For the study of force between charges in parallel/antiparallel motion, the straight
conductors may be used, Fig.2.3.
The force between these can be measured with an apparatus shown in Fig.2.4.
Either a torsion balance may be used as in the previous electric experiments or the
force may be balanced by means of weights. Let the parallel conductors have length
L, much larger than the distance x between them. For parallel currents as in the left
of Fig.2.3, the measurement gives
¯F1→2 = −μ0I1I2
2πx L ˆx
(2.3)
I is current and the natural constant μ0 is called magnetic permeability. As in
the electric case, the force on the other conductor is opposite in direction but equal

2.2.3 Measurement of Perpendicular Motion
The force between charges in relative perpendicular motion can be explored using an
electron beam incident on a straight current-carrying conductor as in Fig.2.5. Since
the conductor is electrically neutral, the generated force is magnetic, arising from
the motion of charge.

(2.4)
where ˆy is the unit vector in the y-direction and I1 is the current in the conductor.
q2, v2 and x2 are charge, velocity and distance to the conductor respectively of
one particular free electron. The current I1 ﬂows in the negative y direction and
is therefore negative as well as charge q2 and speed v2 so that the force becomes
negative, i.e. parallel to the conductor current I1, in accordance with observation.
The measurement assumes a knowledge of the charge to mass ratio of the electron,
a quantity usually measured in high-school, see Exercise (5.12). Alternatively, let an
electron beam pass through a pair of charged parallel plates using an apparatus such
as in Fig.2.5. By balancing the electric force by a parallel straight current-carrying
conductor, the charge to mass ratio of the electron is obtained. The electric force
from the two charged plates will be calculated in Chap.4.
The magnetic force of the perpendicular motion can not be studied with closed
conductors because the force then vanishes, see Exercise (2.10).

2.2.4 Magnetic Force for General Uniform Motion
Based on the two measurements above, a formula is sought for the magnetic force
between two free electric charges in uniform but otherwise arbitrary motion.
Parallel motion. Considering free electrons (or charges in general) in parallel
motion, the expected force situation is then as shown in Fig.2.7.
To determine the magnetic force on charge 2, replace length L with the inﬁni-
tesimal element dL in formula (2.3). This element corresponds to one and only one
electron. Using formula (2.2) the current element becomes
IdL = nqvAdL = nqvdV = qv
(2.5)
where dV is the volume occupied by one electron.
Thus, the magnetic force on electron 2 caused by the left ﬂux (no. 1) of Fig.2.7 is2
¯F1→el2 = −μ0I1
2πx I2dL2 ˆx = −μ0I1
2πx q2v2 ˆx
(2.6)
where ﬂux 1 is assumed to be long in relation to x. This force is the pairwise sum of
the magnetic forces between all electrons in ﬂux 1 and the single electron 2.
It will now be shown that the contribution to the magnetic force between one
current element in conductor 1, equivalent to an electron, and electron 2 may be
written
¯fm|| = −μ0I1dL1
4π R2
q2v2(a cos θ ˆy + sin θ ˆx)
(2.7)
2 The force is written without inﬁnitesimal sign despite the fact that the right-hand side is inﬁnites-
imal. The reason is that the force element is to be regarded as a speciﬁc electron.

where R is the distance between the electrons, θ is deﬁned in Fig.2.8 and a is a

The factors inside the brackets in formula (2.7) is selected with the following
criteria:
• The vertical component ˆy of formula (2.7) should be cancelled after integration
over dL1.
• The horizontal component ˆx of formula (2.7) should coincide with formula (2.6)
after integration.
The ﬁrst criterion gives of course other possible expressions for the y component
than that in formula (2.7) (which?). The present selection is based on simplicity. To
examine the correctness of formula (2.7), the force is integrated over the entire length
of conductor 1, which is assumed to be of inﬁnite length:

The second term involves the integral

Thus, formula (2.6) has been recreated. Formula (2.7) is therefore a possible
candidate for the magnetic force between charges in parallel motion.
Perpendicular motion is treated similarly to the former parallel case. A general
trial formula for the force between two charges is proposed which is then integrated
and compared to the measurement result.
According to observation the magnetic force is vertical in this case, parallel to
current I1, Fig.2.6. Therefore, the formula should be written so that the horizontal
component vanishes after integration. As the formulas (2.4) and (2.6) are equal in
magnitude, ˆy must be multiplied by sin θ and ˆx is multiplied by b cos θ where b
is a constant (compare previous case), Fig.2.9. Hence, the force on charge 2 for
perpendicular motion is expressed as:
¯fm⊥= μ0I1dL1
4π R2
q2v2(sin θ ˆy + b cos θ ˆx)
(2.10)
which should be integrated from minus to plus inﬁnity, since the straight conductor is
long. This action is technically equal to the previous case (see Exercise 2.8), so that
the cosine term disappears after integration and the result is formula (2.4). Formula
(2.10) is thus veriﬁed as a candidate for the magnetic force between charges in relative
perpendicular motion.
General motion. From the two complementary results, formulas (2.7) and (2.10),
the general magnetic force formula may be deduced. The formula must be expressed
in a coordinate free form and in terms of vectors. In addition, the simplest possible
expression should be chosen. With these restrictions it is quite feasible to obtain the
formula by trial and error. The only vectors that can be used are the velocities and

which is force on object 2. This formula is valid for both cases ¯fm|| and ¯fm⊥(verify
this) and is therefore the general magnetic force formula, i.e. for charges in uniform
motion with arbitrary relative motional direction, see ﬁgure to the above. The reader is
reminded that the measurements are based on electric current in conductors, meaning
that charges move slowly.
With a ̸= 0 longitudinal magnetic forces are allowed which appear when θ = 0 in
Fig.2.8. These forces have been indicated in experiments but not yet been measured
with any precision.
In 1902/1903 Tait and Whittaker performed an analysis on the full measurement
done in 1820–1825 by Ampère concerning forces between current-carrying conduc-
tors. Whittaker and Tait also argued the validity of Newton’s third law about action
and reaction (see next section) and found the following force formula:
¯fm2 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 [(−¯v1 · ¯v2) ˆR + (¯v2 · ˆR)¯v1 + (¯v1 · ˆR)¯v2]
(2.12)
i.e. (2.11) with a = 1.
However, (2.12) was ﬁrst proposed by Maxwell in 1865 as one of four candidates
based on Ampère’s measurements.
Another magnetic force formula was proposed by Grassman in 1845. Based on
the measurements of Ampère together with the exclusion of longitudinal forces, i.e.
a = 0 in (2.11), he obtained
¯f G
m2 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 [(−¯v1 · ¯v2) ˆR + (¯v2 · ˆR)¯v1]
(2.13)
Commonly, (2.13) is taken as the general magnetic force formula. It is usually
written
¯f G
m2 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 ¯v2 × (¯v1 × ˆR)
(2.14)
as a consequence of vector algebra.
The reason for the popularity of formula (2.14) is that it correctly describes
phenomena appearing in daily life as well as in technical applications. In plaintext it
means that it describes such cases where at least one of the interacting objects moves
in a closed path, including both permanent magnets and electric circuits. In case both

2.2 Uniform Motion–Magnetic Force
15
objects are free charges, a certain problem with Grassman’s formula (2.13)/(2.14)
will appear. This is discussed in the next section.
It may be shown that the general magnetic force formula (2.11) is reduced to
(2.13)/(2.14) in case one of the interacting objects is a closed current, see Exercise
(2.10).
2.2.5 Evaluation of the Magnetic Force Formulas
Momentum. Grassman’s force formula (2.13)/(2.14) is marred by a peculiar property
since for free charges it violates Newton’s third law: to every force there is a coun-
terforce of equal size and opposite direction. Hence, Grassman’s formula violates
the law of momentum conservation. This is shown as follows.
The force (2.13)/(2.14) acts on object 2. To obtain the force on object 1, the
quantities are interchanged and the sign of the distance vector changed:
¯f G
m1 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 [(¯v1 · ¯v2) ˆR −(¯v1 · ˆR)¯v2] ̸= −¯f G
m2
(2.15)
The problem occurs since formula (2.13) is asymmetric in v1 and v2. This is
corrected in formula (2.12) which for object 1 becomes
¯fm1 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 [(¯v1 · ¯v2) ˆR −(¯v1 · ˆR)¯v2 −(¯v2 · ˆR)¯v1] = −¯fm2
(2.16)
in agreement with Newton’s third law.
In this book, formula (2.11) is considered as the basic magnetic force formula and
it will be referred to as Whittaker’s formula. The constant a is still today unknown.
However, neither Grassman’s nor Whittaker’s force is generally directed along
the connection line of the charges. Such a force will violate the principle of angular
momentum conservation, i.e. rotational motion, discussed in Exercise (2.12).
In technical applications magnetic effects usually appear through closed current-
carrying conductors. In this case, (2.11) is simpliﬁed considerably since the two last
terms then vanish, a simpliﬁcation easily obscured if Grassman’s force (2.14) is used
as guiding formula. This is shown in Exercise (2.10).
Electric charges in parallel motion. Consider the interaction between two identi-
cal charges in parallel motion with equal velocity v perpendicular to distance vector
R, Fig.2.10. This phenomenon appears both in particle accelerators and in electron
tubes and is therefore well documented for free charges. Both formulas (2.11) and
(2.14) give
¯fm = −μ0qvqv ˆR
4π R2
(2.17)
and the total force on q2 becomes

(2.18)
Formula (2.18) is well veriﬁed for free charges in particle accelerators. Since the
formula stems from measurement on closed conductors it provides another veriﬁca-
tion for the model of electric conductor current which was used above.
Formula (2.2) provides an estimate of the drift velocity of the conduction electrons
in ordinary conductors of about 1mm/s. Using your self-measured values for ε0 and
μ0 or utilizing tabulated values it is found that at this speed the magnetic force of
Fig.2.10 is a factor 1023 less than the electric force. Nevertheless, the magnetic force
is easily observed using current-carrying conductors because of the large number of
conduction electrons all contributing to the magnetic force in the same direction.
Now consider the case when the motion of the two like charges is anti-parallel.
From the deﬁnition of electric current, formula (2.2), it is clear that this case is, with
respect to magnetic force, equivalent to considering two unlike charges in parallel
motion, see Fig.2.11.
Since two parallel conductors with opposite currents repel, the magnetic force on
object 2 (right object) is positive and the electric force is negative:

Extrapolating beyond the given measurement range, which is up to a tenth of light
speed, will show that at the speed v = 1/√ε0μ0 the magnetic and electric forces are
balanced and the interaction ceases. This phenomenon can be observed in particle
accelerators where like charges move in parallel close to this speed.
On the basis of Figs.2.10 and 2.11 the origin of magnetic force and its relation to
theory of relativity will be explored in Chap.9.
2.3 Accelerated Motion–Inductive Force
Electric charges in acceleration may be examined by connecting and disconnecting
a battery included in a circuit, Fig.2.12.
The current in the loop can be measured using a current meter based on the
magnetic force as above. When the battery is connected the current in the circuit
increases as in Fig.2.12. Thus, it takes a certain time for the electrons to reach their
ﬁnal speed. This is a kind of inertia which can be considered as a resistance to the
effect of the battery.
Charges in acceleration can be further studied by using two loops, Fig.2.13. The
following is then observed:
A. The loops are in the same plane, one enclosing the other and with parallel cross
sections, Fig.2.13 left
If and only if the current in one varies, a current is induced in the other according
to the following:
• Increasing the current in one conductor induces an opposite current in the other.
• Decreasing the current in one conductor induces a same directed current in the
other.
• The faster the current variation in one conductor the greater induction current in
the other.

E. The loops are in the same plane but not enclosing
A
A far smaller current is induced compared to case A, which quickly decreases
with increasing distance.
The observations may be summarized:
• The response, i.e. the induction current, is such that changes of the system’s total
current is opposed.
• The response is strictly anti-parallel to the acceleration the battery causes since no
induction current is registered for crossed conductors.
• The response decreases with distance between the loops.
To reduce the complexity of the phenomena a second experiment is set up. This
consists of two large rectangular circuits, Fig.2.14.
Since the circuits are large, the two sides closest to each other will control the
interaction. Thus, in this way the interaction between two straight and parallel con-
ductors is examined. As in the previous experiment there is no response from circuit
2 in case the battery current is constant as well as when the two straight conductors
are perpendicular to each other. The force that appears on the electrons in the straight
conductor 2 is therefore either parallel or anti-parallel to the length element dL1. A

Electrodynamic Force
force appears only if there is an acceleration of the electrons in conductor 1, see
Fig.2.14. The force is observed to be proportional to the ﬁrst time derivative of the
battery current as is also observed in the previous experiment.
All observations and measurements from these two experiments may now be
summarized in a concise formula. The inductive force on an electron of conductor 2
is deduced as
¯find,2 = −C(R)q2
dI1
dt d ¯L1
(2.20)
which is force on charge q2 in segment 2 belonging to the conductor without battery.
In formula (2.20), the force is really inﬁnitesimal but since the length element dL1
is considered to contain one concrete electron, the force is denoted without the
inﬁnitesimal sign. The formula is motivated as follows:
According to observation, charge 2 is affected even at rest, wherefore it is assumed
that the inductive force is proportional to q2 but independent of the speed of the
charge. This assumption is based on the fact that, according to the electric and
magnetic cases, the source of the force is either current or charge.
The force is directed along segment 1 which motivates the inclusion of the length
element d ¯L1 in the formula. The length element is directed along the current.
The time derivative in formula (2.20) reﬂects the fact that only a variation of
current gives an induction current. Higher order derivatives are excluded as it is
observed that a linearly increasing current induces a constant current in the other
conductor.
The minus sign takes care of the fact that the system opposes current changes; a
phenomenon which is referred to as Lenz’ law.
C(R) is a quantity including other relevant variables, such as the distance R, see
Exercise (2.16). C(R) will be determined in Sect.3.4.
Formula (2.20) gives the force on a charge q2 from a charge q1 contained in a
length element dL1. To obtain the total force on q2 all length elements of conductor
1 have to be summed up along the conductor
¯Find,2 = −

(2.21)
Note that q1 and q2 may belong to the same conductor, so-called self induction,
as in Fig.2.12.
To get a clearer view of the direct interaction between two charges, formula (2.20)
may be rewritten using formula (2.5):
¯find,2 = −C(R)q2q1
d¯v1
dt
(2.22)
If this formula is applied to current growth in a single conductor, the similarity to
Newton’s force formula ¯F = m d¯v/dt becomes ﬂagrant, indicating that induction is
a sort of electric counterpart to inertia.

2.3 Accelerated Motion–Inductive Force
21
Finally, the reader is reminded that these results are obtained from measurements
using closed conductors. In analogy to magnetic force, the possibility that further
terms arise for interaction between free charges cannot be excluded. There is no
experimental data for this case available up to now.
The next chapter will discuss the inductive effect from an energy perspective and
based on formula (2.21) the well veriﬁed Faraday-Henry induction law is derived.
In Chap.9 the origin of the inductive force is examined.

Formulas (2.11) and (2.13) are consistent for closed conductors where only the
ﬁrst term in both formulas remains. They also agree if charge 2 is free but charge 1
is part of a closed conductor.
For charges in acceleration there is also an inductive force. For two interacting
charges in closed conductors it is

1820–1825. He studied the interaction between all possible closed conduc-
tor structures and could compile his measurements in the following force

One small equation;

James Clerk Maxwell, 1876
Maxwell refers here to formula (1.1) as Tait’s equation.
In describing physical processes, the energy concept is complementary to the force
description. Being a scalar, it is computationally advantageous to compute the energy
of a system and then apply the energy principle, formula (1.1), to obtain all compo-
nents of force.
Energy exists in two forms that are continuously converted into each other:
• Potential energy, also known as stored energy.
• Kinetic energy, also known as motional energy.
The energy principle explains that the total energy in nature is conserved and that
the dynamics, i.e. the forces, result as a minimization process of stored energy.
Energy appears in an interaction and is stored in the system deﬁned by the inter-
acting constituents. Stored energy can not be attributed to a single object.
In this chapter electric and magnetic energy will be deﬁned. The starting point is
the concept of work, i.e. force times distance. The active forces are the electric and
the inductive generating electric and magnetic energy respectively.

Furthermore, the inductance concept will be introduced through which
Faraday-Henry’s law of induction is formulated.
3.1 Electric Energy
A system consisting of a number of charges possesses potential energy known as
electric energy. The amount of energy corresponds to the work needed to merge
these charges.
In Fig.3.1 a work W is done in bringing together two like charges qi and q j.
While the charge qi is ﬁxed, let the external force F bring charge q j along the R-axis
towards charge qi starting from inﬁnity. The force F must be at least as large as the
repulsive electric force and the minimum work required is thus
W =
Ri j

= Ui j (3.1)
In the ﬁrst integral ¯F · d ¯s is positive since ds and F are parallel. The integrand of
the second integral is also positive because d R
′
i j is negative since distance decreases.
In formula (3.1), the force F is set equal to the electric force so that kinetic energy
does not appear. Ui j is then the electric stored energy between two charges.
For a general system a pairwise summation is done:
Ue = 1
2

i, j
qiq j
4πε0Ri j
(3.2)
where the sum runs over all charges as long as i does not equal j. The factor 1/2
accounts for double counting. Note that the sign of the charges decides whether the
energy is positive or negative. If for example a pair of charges have opposite signs
the electric energy is negative indicating that the process to bring one charge to the
other does not require any external work but appears naturally.
The concept electric potential i is deﬁned through the electric energy. At the
position of charge qi the potential is
i =

(3.4)
The dynamics of a system is governed by the change of the stored energy with
respect to the space coordinates. If a charge q is moved from point a to point b and
everything else is unchanged, the energy change of the system is
Ue = q(b −a)
(3.5)
The potential difference between two points is also referred to as voltage
 = b −a
(3.6)
a quantity that common voltmeters are calibrated to measure.
3.2 The Voltage Source
Magneticenergywillbedeﬁnedforclosed current-carryingconductors.Beforedoing
this, the concept ‘voltage source’ needs to be deﬁned. In Sect.2.2 magnetic force was
discussed in terms of the electric circuit which is driven by a voltage source. This
provides a voltage by which electrons gain kinetic energy. During this process the
voltage source is doing work and therefore its stored energy is diminished.
The function of the voltage source may either be based on an electrochemical or
a magnetic process, see ﬁgure.
An electrochemical cell, more commonly known as a battery, transports electrons
through chemical processes from the plus to the minus pole of the battery and works
accordingly against the internal electric force, see left ﬁgure above. The electric
energy, of which the electron is one part, increases thereby and will be used to create
kinetic energy of the electron in the next step.
A corresponding process in the gravitational case is rolling a ball uphill and letting
gravity generate motion downhill.

36

Electrodynamic Energy
A magnetic voltage source works in principle as illustrated in the right-hand ﬁgure,
where the moving permanent magnet usually is another current-carrying circuit. In
this case there is accordingly no battery voltage but it is customary to introduce a
ﬁctitious so-called induction voltage deﬁned by the generated current. This will be
discussed in Sect.3.5.
Henceforth, the word ‘battery’ will be referred to as a voltage source of any kind.
3.3 Magnetic Energy
Magnetic energy for electric circuits is deﬁned by the amount of work a battery has
to do in order to accelerate the conduction electrons to a ﬁnal current I. The force
the battery has to overcome is accordingly the inductive force, formula (2.20), since
it opposes the external inﬂuence as well as being acceleration dependent.
Single loop. Consider a single loop as in Fig.3.2. Suppose there is a current i
in the loop at time t. As the charges are accelerated, the current increases. The
work required to accelerate an inﬁnitesimal amount of charge dq through the closed
conductor once is
dWb = −

Loop
¯Find · d ¯L1
(3.7)
where formula (2.21) gives
¯Find = −

Loop
C(R)dq di
dt d ¯L2
(3.8)
In formula (3.8) the inﬁnitesimal forces are integrated over d ¯L2 to sum up the
total inductive force that acts on the inﬁnitesimal charge dq. In formula (3.7) the total
inductive force is integrated over d ¯L1 to sum up the total work required to transport
the charge dq through the whole loop. The length elements d ¯L1 and d ¯L2 are in this
case part of the same loop.

3.3 Magnetic Energy

Formula (3.8) is really an inﬁnitesimal force since it acts on the inﬁnitesimal
element dq, which however is to be considered as a real electron. Therefore the
force is denoted without inﬁnitesimal sign.
The inﬁnitesimal magnetic energy becomes

and contains only geometrical properties of the conductor. The integration in (3.10)
includes all pairwise interactions between the length elements of the conductor. The
scalar product ensures that perpendicular elements do not affect each other, which
is experimentally observed (see Sect.2.3). Applied to only one conductor, as in this
case, M is called self inductance.
The magnetic energy may now be expressed as:
dUm = Mdq di
dt = Midt di
dt = Mi di
(3.11)
The total energy transferred by the battery when the current increases from 0 to
its ﬁnal value I becomes1

Several loops. Consider now a system of several loops, Fig.3.3. To ﬁnd the total
magnetic energy the interactions between the loops have to be considered. The inter-
action is governed by the inductance M which can generally be written
M jk =

1 Note the similarity between formula (3.12) and mechanical kinetic energy 1/2mv2. This is not a
coincidence since magnetism is directly connected to the motion of charges. It is interesting that
JC Maxwell proposed the name ‘electric inertia’ for inductance M, see also Sect.2.3.

For different conductors j and k, M jk is called mutual inductance. It will be shown
in Sect.3.4 that C is solely dependent on the distance between the current elements
so that

According to formula (3.11), a current increase dik causes a change of magnetic
energy

consider a system with just two loops:
dUm = M11i1di1 + M12i1di2 + M21i2di1 + M22i2di2
(3.16)
Since the energy of the system is independent of the order in which the currents were
generated in the loops (why?) it may be done for one loop at a time:
1. Increase the current to I1 in loop 1: di2 = 0, i2 = 0,
Um1 = M11

where j may also equal k, so-called self inductance.
Formula (3.19) was obtained by assuming ﬁxed inductance. But it is also valid
for varying inductances, which will be utilized in the next section.
3.3.1 Magnetic Force from Magnetic Energy
When dealing with magnetic forces, closed circuits are usually considered where
the current is maintained by a battery and is therefore (quasi)-constant. When apply-
ing the energy force relation, formula (1.1), the battery plays a crucial role in the
following way.
Consider an interaction between two current-carrying loops, Fig.3.3. For constant
current, a change of the magnetic interaction energy appears through a change of the
mutual inductance, i.e. through a change of the distance between the loops or their
relative orientation. Thus, according to formula (3.19),
dUm = 1
2 I1I2dM12 + 1
2 I2I1dM21 = 1
2[I1d(I2M12) + I2d(I1M21)]
(3.20)
where the currents are given at ﬁnal values, i.e. restored by the batteries. This requires
work from the batteries dWb that will change the energy according to formula (3.16):
dUb = −dWb = −(I1M12dI2 + I2M21dI1)
= −[I1d(M12I2) + I2d(M21I1)]
(3.21)
where the inductances are regarded as ﬁnal values and the batteries restore the current
in that situation. Note that the self inductances are not included here since only the
interaction between the loops is considered.
Thus, dUb = −2dUm and the change of the total energy becomes
dU = dUm + dUb = −dUm
(3.22)
The force is therefore
¯Fm = ∇Um
Constant current!
(3.23)
so that in case of constant current the magnetic force acts towards maximizing the
magnetic energy.

3.4 General Inductance—Interaction Between
Two Current Elements
Using formula (3.23) and the knowledge about the magnetic force between paral-
lel currents as well as the general magnetic energy formula (3.19), the inductance
formula (3.13) will now be completed.
It is then ﬁrst relevant to ask why the magnetic energy, whose deﬁnition is based
upon the work done by the inductive force, is related to the magnetic force according
to formula (3.23). Consider two parallel current-carrying conductors, e.g. of circular
form. For parallel currents there is an attractive force. During the attraction the
currents will however decrease, see Exercise (3.9c), which is exactly compensated
by the battery. The work of the battery, related to the work of the inductive force as
explained above, is thereby connected to the energy change that arises because of
the magnetic force between circuits.
Based on the fact that magnetic energy is related to magnetic force according to
formula (3.23), the expression of the factor C in formulas (2.22) and (3.13) may be
determined. The known force formula between two parallel current elements is then
utilized, obtained from formula (2.11), Fig.3.4.
The force on element 2 becomes
¯fm = −μ0I1L1I2L2
4π R2

(3.24)
The magnetic interaction energy for this system is according to formula (3.19)
Um = M12I1I2
(3.25)
where from formula (3.13)
M12 = C(R)L1L2
(3.26)
so that the magnetic energy may be written
Um = C(R)I1L1I2L2
(3.27)

(3.30)
where R is the distance between the length elements, Figs.3.2 and 3.3. This is
Neumann’s formula from 1845.
Further experimental support to the formulas (3.29) and (3.30) is obtained from
Faraday-Henry’s law of induction, derived in next section.
3.5 Faraday-Henry’s Induction Law
Energy is related to voltage through formulas (3.5) and (3.6). These are now gener-
alized to be valid also for magnetic energy. The induction voltage ε is then given by
formulas (3.9) and (3.10)
ε = dUm
dq
= di
dt M
(3.31)
for a single circuit with constant inductance M.
If inductance is time dependent, (3.31) is generalized as
ε j = d
dt (ik M jk)
(3.32)
By summing over all circuits, including circuit j for self induction, the general
induction formula becomes
ε j =

k
d
dt (ik M jk)
(3.33)
where M jk is given by formula (3.30), i.e. Neumann’s inductance formula.
Formula (3.33) is known as Faraday-Henry’s induction law and is well veriﬁed.
It conﬁrms therefore the validity of formulas (2.22) and (3.30).

3.8 Exercises
3.1 When a chlorophyll molecule absorbs energy from the sun it is sometimes
said that an electron of the molecule is excited. What is wrong with this
description according to the principles outlined in this chapter?
Answer: A single electron cannot be excited. The energy increase is stored
in the molecule through an electric interaction between the electron and the
rest of the molecule. Thus, it is rather the molecule that is being excited.
3.2 Consider the electric pairwise interaction. Convince yourself that the electric
energy decreases for both repulsive and attractive interaction.

Macroscopic Systems of Unbound Charges
God does not care about our mathematical difﬁculties. He
integrates empirically.
Albert Einstein, 1942
In this chapter macroscopic systems of individual electric charges will be examined.
These are called unbound charges in contrast to the bound charges that materials are
usually made up of. The conduction electrons in a metal is the most common example
of unbound charges. These are unbound inside the material but cannot normally leave
the metal due to effects of surface bonding.
The aim is to examine the interaction between macroscopic objects. The com-
putational method is introduced using speciﬁc examples, gradually increasing in
complexity. The method is based on the principle that the total force between the two
systems can be obtained by summing up the pairwise interactions between its con-
stituents. In practice, this summation becomes an integration where the microscopic
constituents are represented by inﬁnitesimal elements. Electric systems consist of
inﬁnitesimal point charges dq = ρdV where ρ is the charge density and dV a vol-
ume element. The constituents of magnetic systems are the inﬁnitesimal current
elements Id¯L, i.e. current times the length element.
Often, however, it is impractical to study individual interactions between charges.
The calculations may be facilitated by introducing the concepts of capacitance and
inductance by which the force is considered as a collective action. These concepts
are particularly useful for homogeneous charge and current distributions.
In the calculations, the position vector for the source is denoted ¯r′ and that for
the inﬂuenced element ¯r. The distance vector between the elements is denoted ¯R as
before, pointing to the affected element.
Cylindrical and spherical coordinates are prerequisites for this chapter.
In Chap.8, macroscopic systems will be re-examined, then with emphasis on
bound charge and current appearing as electric and magnetic dipoles.

4.1 Electric Dynamics
In electrostatic systems the basic interaction is described by Coulomb’s force law,
formula (2.1):
¯F1→2 =

4πε0R2 ˆR
(2.1)
4.1.1 Electrically Charged Wire and Point Charge
The force between a homogeneously charged wire with charge per unit length λ′ and
a point charge q is examined, Fig.4.1. An inﬁnitesimal amount of charge of the wire
λ′dz′ is located at a position ¯r′ = (x′, y′, z′). The position vector ¯r points to the
point charge q and the distance between q and λ′dz′ is ¯R. The force on the charge q
from an inﬁnitesimal element on the wire becomes
d ¯F = λ′dz′q
4πε0R2 ˆR = λ′dz′q
4πε0R3 ¯R
(4.1)
To obtain the total force of all contributions from the elements on the wire have
to be summed. Firstly, the distance vector is expressed in terms of coordinates
¯R = ¯r −¯r′ = (x −x′)ˆx + (y −y′) ˆy + (z −z′)ˆz
(4.2)
Let the wire coincide with the z-axis, i.e. x′ = y′ = 0. To simplify, let the point
charge q be located at the point (x, y, z) = (d, 0, 0) so that
¯R = d ˆx −z′ˆz
(4.3)
Fig. 4.1 A point charge q

The z component is an odd function and vanishes (only in this case where the point
charge is located halfway along the length of the wire).
For a very long wire, mathematically inﬁnite, end effects are neglected. Practically
it means that the charge q is placed close to the wire. The force becomes
lim
L→∞
¯F =
λ′q
2πε0d ˆx
(4.6)
since d2 in the square root of the denominator of formula (4.5) may be neglected.
Thus, the force between a long wire and a point charge is inversely proportional
to the distance between them.
4.1.2 Force Between Two Electrically Charged Wires
Next consider two parallel homogeneously charged wires with length L located in
the xz plane, Fig.4.2.
If end effects are neglected, i.e. L →∞, the force on each length element on the
right wire is given by formula (4.6), with q = λdz. The total force between the wires
becomes
¯F = λ′λL
2πε0d ˆx
(4.7)
If the wires are of ﬁnite length, i.e. end effects are included, formula (4.4) is
generalized to a double integral. Thus, with one wire coinciding with the z axis and

4.1.3 Force Between a Point Charge and an Electrically
Charged Plate
Consider the force on a point charge from a large homogeneously charged plate, so
large that effects at the edge of the plate may be neglected. This approximation is
valid if the distance d between the point charge and the plate is small relative to the
size of the plate.
The plate is located parallel to the yz plane and the point charge has coordinates
(x, y, z), Fig.4.3. Viewed along the z direction, Fig.4.4, the plate may be considered
as being built up by close wires.
The force on the point charge from one wire is given by formula (4.6):

a charged plate and a point

Using(4.9)asummationofthewiresalong y canbeperformed.Thewirethickness
is then considered to be inﬁnitesimal, dy′. A length element of the wire contains a
charge q′ = λ′dz′ = σdy′dz′ where σ accordingly is charge per unit surface of the
plate. Thus, λ′ = σdy′. The coordinates of the point charge are set to (d, 0, 0). With
the plate in the yz plane the distance vector becomes ¯R = (¯r −¯r′) = d ˆx −y′ ˆy −z′ˆz.
The calculation is performed in the xy plane so that z = z′ = 0. The force on the

4.1.4 Electric Force Between a Point Charge
and a Charged Sphere
Next the force between a point charge and a homogeneously charged sphere is
examined. The calculation is done with the point charge inside and outside the sphere.
At the intersection, the results should coincide. To utilize the symmetry, spherical
coordinates are used. The charge density of the sphere is denoted ρ. The total charge
of the sphere is Q and its centre is placed at the coordinate origin (Fig.4.5).
To obtain the force between the objects, it is in this case preferable to use the
energy principle, formula (1.1). The energy is obtained from formula (3.2) with the
sum replaced by an integration:
Ue =
q
4πε0

V
ρdV′
R
(4.12)
where V is the volume of the sphere. Note that the correction factor 1/2 in formula
(3.2) is missing since the sum runs over just one of the objects.
Without losing generality the point charge may be placed on the z axis. Using the
cosine rule, the distance vector may be written
R = (r′2 + z2 −2r′z cos θ′)1/2
(4.13)
where θ′ is the angle between r and r′. The energy becomes

i.e. the same result as between two point charges at a distance z. Thus, outside a

charge Q located at the centre.

where Q′ is the total charge up to the radius ka. Thus, the force on the point charge
is given solely by the charge existing at a radius less than or equal to the distance
between the point charge and the centre of the sphere. This phenomenon is known
as Gauss’ theorem and will be revisited in Exercise (10.3).

4.1.5 Capacitor and Capacitance
The capacitance is a useful quantity when describing electric interactions between
macroscopic objects, in particular when the charge distribution is homogeneous. It
may be deﬁned through a construction called a capacitor which usually consists of
two objects, normally two conductors. These are charged by a voltage source which
transports electrons from one object to the other resulting in equal amounts of charge
but with opposite signs on the two objects, Fig.4.8.
The capacitor may be used to accumulate and temporarily store electric energy and
is as such used in many different technical applications. The name capacitor refers to
having capacity (to store charge). Ideally the imbalance of charge of the capacitor is
maintained after disconnecting the voltage source. Practically, however, a constant
discharge to the surrounding takes place at a rate depending on the properties of the
surrounding environment.
In case the charge distributions on the two objects are homogeneous, it may be
concluded using formula (3.3) that the potential from one object and therefore the
voltage 	
 between the two objects is proportional to the stored charge Q, i.e.,
	
 = Q
C ⇒C =
Q
	
(4.20)
The capacitance C is therefore a purely geometrical quantity. By measuring the
voltage between the two objects, the stored charge on the objects as well as the
stored energy are obtained through the capacitance of the system. Before applying
the capacitance concept to force and energy calculations the capacitance for two
important cases will be derived.
As will be shown in Sect.5.1, excess charge is collected at the surface of a conduc-
tor wherefore such systems are similar to thin shells. This simpliﬁes the calculation
of capacitance. The concept of capacitance is however not reserved for conductor
systems. In this chapter, the material of the objects will not be speciﬁed but will
in general be assumed to be thin shells. In Chap.5 the discussion of capacitance
continues speciﬁcally for conductors.
4.1.5.1 Capacitance of Parallel Plates
Consider two large parallel plates with area A and distance x, Fig.4.6. What is the
capacitance? To determine the capacitance the relation between voltage and charge
is examined. To this end, the work required to transport a point charge between the
plates is determined. Assume the plates to have the same charge Q with opposite
signs. The force on a point charge q between the plates is twice that of formula (4.11)
since two plates now act on the charge.

Consider two concentric spherical shells. Assume they are charged to Q and −Q
respectively, Fig.4.7. What is the capacitance? Utilizing the method introduced in

is determined:

4.1.6 Electric Energy Stored in a Capacitor
The electric energy stored by a charged capacitor is now determined. The work to
generate the energy is provided by a battery.
The battery is connected to the capacitor and its task is to bring electrons from
one plate to the other, Fig.4.8. Assume that at time t the charge on one of the plates
is q. The work required to bring an inﬁnitesimal amount of charge dq from one plate
to the other is
dWb = dq	
(t)
(4.28)
where 	
(t) is the voltage between the plates at time t. This varies with time
according to the change of charge on the plates:
	
(t) = q(t)
C
(4.29)
In reality, the charges are transported through the battery but the work that is con-
verted to potential energy is in magnitude the same as if the charges were transported
Fig. 4.8 Charging a

between the plates. Thus, the battery work will be partly converted into kinetic energy,
corresponding to heat in the circuit. The minimum work to charge the capacitor to a

4.1.7 Electric Force Between Two Charged Plates
As an application of formula (4.30) the electric force between two charged plates is
now determined. This will be done in two different ways: ﬁrstly without and then
with a voltage source connected to the plates. In both cases the energy principle is
used, keeping in mind that the complete energy of the system must be considered. In
the ﬁrst case this is the electric energy but in the second case there is also a battery
energy, compare the magnetic case in Sect.3.3.1.
Consider two identical parallel charged plates with opposite charges Q and surface
area A, Fig.4.9 (left). One plate is located at x = x1 and the other at x = x2 where
x2 > x1. The force on the latter becomes

way is challenging (why?).
By connecting the capacitor to a voltage source the measurement is simpliﬁed,
Fig.4.9 (right). The total energy in the system is then
U = Ue + Ub
(4.34)
i.e. the electric energy stored by the plates plus the energy of the battery. The battery
will now maintain the voltage between the plates. When the plates approach each
other the tendency of nature to reduce the voltage between the plates is opposed by
the battery by adding charge to the plates. The battery energy decreases by dUb for
each small amount of charge dq that is added to the plates.
−dUb = dWb = dq

(4.35)
The change of the system’s total energy then becomes

(4.37)
which is the same as in the ﬁrst case, the only difference being that voltage is main-

¯F = −1

which for a voltage of a few kilovolts gives a relatively large and easily measured

of charge are involved. Be careful!

4.2 Magnetic Dynamics

4.2 Magnetic Dynamics
For magnetic systems, the fundamental interaction is governed by formula (2.11):
¯fm2 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 [(−¯v1 · ¯v2) ˆR + (¯v2 · ˆR)¯v1 + a(¯v1 · ˆR)¯v2]
(2.11)
If the force on charge 2 originates from the current in a closed conductor the last
term in (2.11) vanishes and Grassman’s formula results:
¯f G
m2 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 [(−¯v1 · ¯v2) ˆR + (¯v2 · ˆR)¯v1]
(2.13)
= μ0q1q2
4π R2 [¯v2 × (¯v1 × ˆR)]
(2.14)
In case the interaction takes place between closed conductors, the second as well
as the third term in formula (2.11) vanish:
¯fm2 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 (−¯v1 · ¯v2) ˆR
(2.26)
4.2.1 Magnetic Force Between a Point Charge and a Long
Straight Current
In Sect.2.2.4 it was shown that the force between a long straight current-carrying
conductor and a charge Q with velocity v parallel to the current is given by formula
(2.6)
¯F2→Q = −μ0I2
2πρ Qv ˆρ
(4.39)
where ρ is the shortest distance between the charge and the conductor. Q is negative
for an electron. This formula will now be generalised to allow for an arbitrary motion
of the charge Q, Fig.4.10.
Since the straight conductor is considered as being of inﬁnite length and therefore
closed (see Exercise 2.10), Grassman’s magnetic force law may be used. Expressed
in current elements, formula (2.5), the force on element 1 is
d ¯F = μ0I1d¯L1 × (I2d¯L2 × ˆR)
4π R2
(4.40)
where the distance vector R is directed from element 2 to element 1.
The current is directed along the z-axis. Using cylindrical coordinates (z, ρ, φ)
and putting I1d¯L1 = Q¯v the force becomes

4.2.2 Magnetic Force Between Point Charge and Large
Current-Carrying Plate
Several long straight current-carrying conductors are now put together to form a large
plate. The force between this array of conductors and a point charge at a distance r
from the plate is examined. In Fig.4.11 the conductors are viewed from above and
the z-axis is directed out of the plane. The calculation is performed for z = 0.
Formula (4.42) gives the force from one of the inﬁnitesimal straight conductors.
Let K denote current per length along y and ˆφ = (sin α ˆx + cos α ˆy) so that

independent of the distance r from the large plate. For positive x values r/ |r| = 1
and for negative x values r/ |r| = −1. The x component in (4.43) vanishes after
integration since the integrand is an odd function of y. Note that y and therefore also
the angle α are negative for the lower half of the plane.
To express formula (4.44a) in a coordinate free form, the surface current density
K is used as a vector in the current direction. The surface normal of the plate, ˆn, is
introduced and deﬁned as a unit vector perpendicular to the surface pointing towards
the other object. Thus

4.2.3 Magnetic Force Between a Straight Conductor
and a Large Plate
To obtain the force between a straight current-carrying conductor and a current-

(4.45)
so that the force on the whole conductor becomes

(4.46)
where L is the length of the conductor directed along the current direction. I is the
current in the straight conductor and K is the current per unit length in the plate.
4.2.4 Magnetic Force and Energy Between Two Parallel
Current-Carrying Plates
Formula (4.46) is now used to determine the force between parallel current-carrying
plates. Edge effects are neglected. Let plate 2 be of inﬁnite extent and let the other
have side lengths Y and Z. The plates carry constant currents per unit length, K1 and
K2, in either direction. In Fig.4.12 the currents have the same sign.
With ˆn directed towards plate 1, formula (4.46) gives the force on an inﬁnitesimal
wire of plate 1
d ¯F = K1dyZ ˆz × ˆy μ0K2
2
(4.47)
Since plate 2 is of inﬁnite extent there is no dependence on y so the integration gives
¯F = μ0
2 Y Z K1K2ˆz × ˆy = −μ0
2 Y Z K1K2 ˆx
(4.48)
The force is accordingly attractive for parallel currents.
The magnetic interaction energy is obtained by calculating the work needed to
separate the plates a distance X. For constant current, the force is independent of x.
When parallel currents are separated the magnetic energy decreases. Let Um(x = x2)
denote a reference energy at x = x2. Move plate 1 from x = x2 a distance X so the
magnetic energy becomes
Um = Um(x = x2) −Fext X = −μ0
2 XY Z K1K2
(4.49)

4.2 Magnetic Dynamics

where in the last step the reference energy is put to zero. For parallel currents K1 and
K2, the magnetic energy increases with decreasing distance between the plates, in
accordance with formula (3.23). For opposite currents, formula (4.49) changes sign.
In Exercise (4.9), the energy is used to determine mutual inductance.
4.2.5 Inductance

between closed circuits. Formula (3.30) deﬁnes inductance as

inductance, formulas (3.19), (3.23) and (3.33) give energy, force and induction
voltage.
4.2.5.1 Mutual Inductance Between Two Coaxial Loops
Consider two coaxial, circular and homogeneous conductors. What is their mutual
inductance? First, let the loops have a common centre with z1 = z2 = 0, Fig.4.13.
Denote the radii of the circles r1 = a and r2 = b. The scalar product between the
length elements is

This lowest order approximation is also known as the dipole approximation since
the dipole is the smallest unit of a magnetic system. This terminology will be further
explained in Sect.7.2.
The force between two loops may now be determined. Assume the currents in
the loops to be maintained by a battery. The magnetic force is then given by formula
(3.23). The loops are located at z1 and z2, where z2 ≫z1 so that (4.64) may be used:
M12 =

4.2.5.3 Self Inductance for an Idealized Coil
An idealized coil can be thought of as consisting of parallel circular loops whose
total mutual and individual inductances become the self-inductance of the coil. The
loops are tight with an inﬁnitesimal thickness such that the coil becomes a cylin-
drical homogeneous surface. The total inductance of the coil is obtained through an
inﬁnitesimal summation, i.e. an integration, Fig.4.14.

should be used with caution.
4.2.6 Induction in a Moving Rod Interacting
with Current-Carrying Plate
The concept of inductance is useful when only closed currents are involved in the
interaction. The concept of a closed conductor implies that the drift motion of the
conduction electrons is along the conductor (compare Exercise 3.9c). The following
example involves a non-closed conductor and illustrates a case where inductance
should not be used.
Let a thin bar-formed conductor, oriented along the x axis, move at a constant
speed v in the negative z direction. It interacts with an inﬁnite plate with homoge-
neous and constant current in the positive z direction, Fig.4.15. The induced voltage
between the end points of the bar is now to be found.
Since the bar is a non-closed conductor the complete magnetic force formula must
be considered:
¯fm2 = μ0q1q2
4π R2 [(−¯v1 · ¯v2) ˆR + (¯v2 · ˆR)¯v1 + a(¯v1 · ˆR)¯v2]
(2.11)
If the inﬁnite plate, equivalent to a closed conductor, is object 1 the third term in
(2.11) vanishes.
Since the conduction electrons of the bar are moving in parallel to the conduction
electrons of the plate, these will be attracted in accordance with formula (2.11). A
current I2 will then be generated in the bar until enough charge has accumulated at
its ends so that the electric force balances the horizontal magnetic force.

conductor in motion interacts

plate

Macroscopic Systems of Unbound Charges
The current in the bar, I2, is directed in the positive x direction. To initially
accelerate the bar an external force is needed. This force acts against the vertical
magnetic force that I2 causes according to formula (4.46). To maintain a constant
speed, the external force must balance this vertical magnetic force. The external
force is then doing work and the change in magnetic energy during a displacement
dz becomes, using formulas (3.23) and (4.46),
dUm = −μ0K1

I2Ldz
(4.86)
where L is the length of the bar and K1 is current per unit length along y. This mag-
netic energy is successively converted to electric energy through the accumulation
of electric charge at the ends of the bar which according to formula (3.31) creates a

Conductors and Resistive Effects
Electricity is often called wonderful, beautiful; but it is so only in
common with the other forces of nature. The beauty of electric-
ity or of any other force is not that the power is mysterious, and
unexpected, touching every sense at unawares in turn, but that
it is under law, and that the taught intellect can even govern it
largely. The human mind is placed above, and not beneath it, and
it is in such a point of view that the mental education afforded by
science is rendered super-eminent in dignity, in practical appli-
cation and utility; for by enabling the mind to apply the natural
power through law, it conveys the gifts of God to man.

makes it also suitable for the study of the fundamental dynamics of nature. It has
thereby been found how the constituents of nature, in this case electrons, interact
under different conditions: at rest, in uniform motion and in acceleration.
With the discovery and completion of the periodic system, new knowledge arose
about metals. Its unique properties as a current and thermal conductor originate
from the fact that each atom in the metal contributes with one or two electrons from
their outermost orbitals to the so-called conduction band where electrons can move
relatively freely. However, the motion is not entirely free due to three reasons:
Firstly, the conduction electrons interact electrically with the rest of the material
which consists of the atoms from which they originate. The atomic vibrations con-
stitute a barrier, a so-called resistance, to their motion. This generates heat which
can be of both advantage and disadvantage in engineering applications.
Secondly, there are inductive forces, i.e. internal interactions between the con-
duction electrons themselves, which macroscopically are described by the quantity
inductance. This is, as previously indicated, the electrodynamic counterpart to inertia
in mechanics.
Thirdly, there are capacitive effects which arise due to physical discontinuities of
the conductor. This stores electric energy as in a capacitor, see Chap.4.
In this chapter, the dynamics that arise in the conductor due to resistive effects are
investigated. In the next chapter, the examination is extended to include the inductive
and capacitive properties of the electric circuit.

5.1 The Metal as a Conductor
To investigate the conductor properties of a metal, the following experiment can be
carried out:
Charge a capacitor consisting of two parallel plates. Disconnect the battery and
measure the voltage  according to Fig.5.1 (left).1 The voltmeter basically mea-
sures the force between the charges accumulated on the different plates. Then intro-
duce a metallic material between the plates ﬁlling the entire volume as in Fig.5.1
(right). The contact between the metal and the capacitor must be insulated, alterna-
tively leave a small air gap. The voltmeter shows that the voltage between the plates
has almost disappeared.
It can be concluded that in the inserted metallic material, a sufﬁcient amount
of charge has been transported to precisely neutralize the charge on the capacitor
plates. This result occurs for both very small and very large initial voltages between
the plates. The metal can thus easily transport electric charge; it is a good conductor,
which is its distinguished property.
The ﬁnal state is static since the voltmeter measures zero voltage. If a charge is
placed inside the metallic material, it would not be affected by any force despite the
fact that external forces affect the metallic material.
Thus, it can be concluded that under static conditions, there is no net charge inside
a metal. The negative charge is neutralized everywhere by positive charge. Excess
charge only appears on the metal surface.
5.2 Relaxation Time
The next step in these experiments is to allow the voltage over the capacitor plates to
vary with time. This is achieved by constructing a circuit with a battery that generates
an alternating voltage, Fig.5.2.
With an oscilloscope, it is recorded that the voltage across the resistor is the same
as the battery voltage, even for high frequencies. The conclusion can be drawn that
the metal neutralizes the voltage across the plates instantly. The process in the metal
to bring charges to the surface of the capacitor plates in order to neutralize its charge
1 To prevent discharges through the meter, a so-called electrostatic voltmeter has to be used. This
has extremely high inner resistance.

is thus extremely fast, faster than what can be measured. This property explains why
one is protected from lightning inside a metal shell such as a car. The charges of the
ﬂash are neutralized immediately on the outer surface.
The time-lapse in a conductor may be estimated by establishing a model of its
dynamics. When the metal is placed between the charged capacitor plates, an electric
force will act on the charges of the metal causing the conduction electrons to move
towards one of the plates, leaving behind a deﬁcit of negative charge on the other
side. During the motion, they are exposed to a frictional force originating in their
interaction with the rest of the conductor material.The frictional force is proportional
to the velocity at low speeds as in this case (see Exercises 2.2 and 5.6). Using formulas
(1.1), (1.2) and (3.5), the equation of motion for the conduction electrons becomes
(neglecting effects of inductance and capacitance):
m d¯v
dt = −q∇ −G¯v
(5.1)
where G is a frictional coefﬁcient depending on the nature of the material, m the
mass of the charge q, v its velocity caused by the external inﬂuence (drift speed) and
 the electric potential experienced by the charge q.
The relaxation time is the time it takes for the charges to be restored after the
external inﬂuence has ceased. To ﬁnd this time, put ∇ = 0, so that
m d¯v
dt = −G¯v
(5.2)
which has the solution
v(t) = Ae−G
m t
(5.3)
where A is the velocity at t = 0, i.e. when the voltage source is disconnected.
The speed of the charges in the conductor thus decreases exponentially with a time
constant
tr = m
G
(5.4)
called relaxation time. The frictional coefﬁcient G is related to the concept of resis-
tance which will be discussed next.

Conductors and Resistive Effects
5.3 Resistance
A conductor is connected to a battery, Fig.5.3. The battery voltage  and current
I through the conductor are measured. A linear relationship between the two is
observed for ordinary values of the voltage. The proportionality is called resistance
R and Ohm’s law is thus obtained:
 = RI
(5.5)
Ohm’s law is valid after several relaxation times because the measurement is
performed a relatively long time after connecting the source. Since relaxation time
is also a measure of the time it takes for the electrons to reach terminal speed, a
constant drift speed is expected.
Solving Eq.(5.1) for the circuit in Fig.5.3 gives
¯v(t) = −q
G ∇

1 −e−G
m t
(5.6)
so that when t →∞then ¯v →−q/G ∇, i.e. a constant.
Ohm’s law may be used to gain information about G. For simplicity, imagine a
homogeneous and straight conductor with length l and cross sectional area S. The
voltage  = −l∇ and the current I = ¯J · ¯S where J is current per unit surface.
It follows from formula (2.5) that ¯J = nq¯v where n is the number of conduction
electrons per unit volume and v is the drift speed of the conduction electrons (see
Exercise 2.24). J is oppositely directed to v since q < 0. Ohm’s law may then be
written
l∇ = −Rnq¯vS
(5.7)
so that
¯v = −

which shows that the origin of resistance is friction. The quantity l/RS = σ is known
as conductivity, which is independent of the conductor geometry. Accordingly, it is
measurable through Ohm’s law and available in tables. Relaxation time becomes
tr = m
G = m
q2n σ
(5.10)
The charge q and the mass m of the electron may be measured as in Exercises
(5.12) and (5.13) and their density n determined using Avogadro’s number (see
Chap.2). The order of magnitude estimate of the relaxation time becomes
tr ∼10−14s
(5.11)
The drift speed is given by
v =
I
Snq
(5.12)
Typical values of cross sectional area and current might be S ≈10−6 m2 and
I ≈1A which gives v ∼0.1mm/s. The electrons also exhibit a random non-
directional motion which is many orders of magnitude larger.
5.4 Heat Power
A normal kettle utilizes the heat generated by the electric current of a conductor.
This heat power is relatively easy to measure through the temperature change in a
water bath in which the conductor is submerged. Through the heat capacity of water
the heat power is obtained.
In this way, the model for electric conduction described above may be veriﬁed
because it predicts the amount of generated heat, whose source is friction. If friction
did not exist, the electrons would be continuously accelerated through the conductor
and achieve very high speeds. Instead, this imagined kinetic energy is converted into
heat which is calculated in the following manner.
The heat energy is the work done by the frictional force, which for one electron is
W f r = Gvl
(5.13)
where the homogeneous conductor is utilized once again, with length l, parallel to
the drift speed v. Power P is this energy divided by the time needed for the electron
to pass through the conductor l/v

5.5 The Principle of Charge Conservation
In the analysis above, the fundamental law of electric charge conservation has been
used implicitly. The strongest evidence for this principle originates from the mea-
surement of electric currents in circuits. The well-veriﬁed Kirchoff’s law states that
in a branch point of a circuit, the sum of the input currents equals the output. With the
modern understanding of electric current, the conservation of electric charge follows
directly.
This can be expressed mathematically by a continuity equation in the follow-
ing way. The charge Q in a volume V may be changed only by transportation of
charge through the enclosing surface. Thus, if the total current through that surface
is denoted by I:
I + dQ
dt = 0
(5.16)
This equation is valid over an extended volume, but may be localized by introducing
current density
¯J = dI

(5.17)
where da is an inﬁnitesimal surface and ˆn its surface normal. The continuity equation
becomes

This is the continuity equation for electric charge in its general form, valid for each
point in space. It will be revisited in Chap.10 when Maxwell’s equations are derived.

5.12 Determination of charge to mass ratio of the electron
A beam of electrons is directed towards an ideal coil perpendicular to its
axis. When inside the coil the electrons exhibit a circular path. The radius
of the path is measured and denoted by r. The current per length unit in the
coil along the coil axis is K and the high voltage generating the electron
beam is .
Using these measurable quantities ﬁnd an expression for the charge to mass
ratio of the electron.
Hint: In Exercise (7.12) it is shown that the force on a charge inside an ideal
coil is twice that from a large plate, formula (4.44b).
The performance of this experiment needs a tube ﬁlled with a gas at low
pressure. The electrons excite the gas atoms which when de-excited become
visible. The track of the electrons may then be observed from which the
radius can be measured.
5.13 Determination of the electron charge—the Millikan experiment.
In the beginning of 1900 Millikan designed an apparatus for measuring the
elementary charge, i.e. the electron charge. It consists of a vertical parallel
plate capacitor located in a dark container ﬁlled with air. On the upper plate
a small hole is drilled. The purpose of this crucial hole is to let small oil
drops pass through into the region between the plates. The oil drops are
produced by using a simple spray mechanism. While passing through the
hole they become charged through the friction that occurs against the wall
of the hole. The drops become randomly charged (Fig.5.4).
The hypothesis is then that the amount of charge is so small that by mea-
suring on several drops the discreteness of charge may be revealed. In such

observed by the telescope. Using a built-in distance scale the velocity of an oil drop may be deter-
mined through a time measurement. The voltage over the capacitor plates is established by means
of the pins on the picture
a case, the measurement should conﬁrm that the charge of the oil drops is
always a multiple of a smallest charge corresponding to the electron charge.
The measurement consists of determining the speed of the oil drop in two
cases:
• Without voltage over the plates. The drop is falling by gravity with speed
vf.
• With high voltage over the plates. The motion is reversed and the drop
rises with speed vr.
The speeds are terminal speeds which are achieved quickly.
When analysing this phenomena it is ﬁrst realized that basically three forces
have to be considered:
• The gravitational Fg
• The air resistance Ffr
• The electric Fe
Assuming the oil drops to be spherical, the frictional force is (compare
Exercise 5.6):
¯F f r = −G¯v = 6πηa¯v
where η is the viscosity of air and a is the radius of the drop. The last
expression is called Stokes’ law and is obtained from ﬂuid mechanics.

In the beginning of 1900 Bohr proposed a model of the atom considering its
constituents as pointlike particles carrying charge. Basically his model has

of the model.)
Consider a hydrogen atom consisting of one proton as the nucleus and one
surrounding electron.
a. Assuming the electron orbiting around the proton in a circular path with

system?
b. Due to its relatively large mass, the proton is assumed to be ﬁxed. What
is the speed of the electron?
Use tabulated values for the elementary charge and electron mass.
C* 5.15 Edge effects of parallel plates capacitor
In Sect.4.1.5.1 the capacitance for a parallel plate capacitor was derived.
The capacitor was then assumed to be so-called ‘ideal’, meaning that the
plates are so large that their edges may be disregarded. This is of course
in practice never true but ‘edge effects’ are always present. These may
be understood by considering the procedure for obtaining capacitance. In
Fig.4.6, external work is done by transporting a point charge against the
electric force from one to the other plate.
Consider the following statement.
‘If the transportation of the point charge is done close to the edges of the
plates a smaller electric force will act against the external force and thereby a
smaller work is done. The calculation of work and consequently capacitance
will therefore depend on the path chosen for the point charge.’
a. Is this reasonable? Explain.
b. What is the reason for this wrong statement?
c. What condition must hold for the potential over the plates and for the
electric force between the plates?
d. How will the conditions found in task c affect the charge distribution on
the plates?
e. Assuming the charge distribution to be known, ﬁnd an expression for
calculating the capacitance.
Solution
a. This is not reasonable since the work should be independent of chosen
path. It depends only on the voltage between the plates.
b. The reason is that a homogeneous charge distribution has been assumed,
as in the ‘ideal’ capacitor case. At the edges there is a deﬁcit of neigh-
bouring charges to build up the force.

Watson, ... if I can get a mechanism which will make a current of

Alexander Graham Bell, 1926
The electric current is the basis for modern technology. The applications consist
of electric circuits, i.e. closed conductors. Using a voltage source, electric currents
are generated which are controlled by the other components of the circuit: resistors,
inductors and capacitors. This chapter examines examples of electric dynamics aris-
ing when all these components co-exist. The objective is to achieve an understanding
of oscillation and resonance circuits.
In circuits, only the collective effect of charges in motion is observed. Therefore,
the theoretical treatment is based on the energy concept. The generated energy is
thus magnetic in an inductor, electric in a capacitor and heat in a resistor. The key to
describing current variation in a circuit is Kirchoff’s potential law, being based on
the principle of energy conservation.
Familiarity with complex numbers is assumed.

Usually, the capacitance is so small that the charging process becomes very quick.
Using a pulse generator as a voltage source and an oscilloscope as a voltmeter the
current variation may be studied. By generating a square wave, corresponding to an
alternating connection and disconnection of the battery, formula (6.3) may easily be
explored. It is convenient to determine the time it takes for the current to reach half
its maximum value, the so-called half-time
T1/2 = RC ln 2
(6.4)
which can be used to determine capacitance if R is known.
6.2 Measurement of Inductance Using an RL Circuit
An inductor is now connected in series with a battery and a resistor, Fig.6.2. In circuit
theory, it is customary to denote self-inductance L. L and R represent the circuit’s
entire inductance and resistance respectively.
When a voltage is applied, the current increases in the circuit, i.e. the conduction
electrons are accelerated. The inductive effect is an inertia against this acceleration,
i.e. a resistance. From the positive to the negative pole of the battery, the poten-
tial across the inductor decreases, described by Faraday-Henry’s law of induction,
formula (3.31):

from which inductance can be determined if R is known. As in the capacitor case the
time-lapse is short making it necessary to use a pulse generator and an oscilloscope.
6.3 The Oscillation Circuit
Manyinstrumentsthatmeasureinductanceandcapacitanceutilizetheso-calledoscil-
lation circuit. Consider the series circuit as in Fig.6.3. Two cases will be analysed.
Firstly, the battery generates a constant voltage and secondly a voltage that varies
sinusoidally with time. This latter case is suitable for studying the important reso-
nance phenomena. Oscillatory solutions are sought in both cases.

The potential equation is formulated for the circuit in Fig.6.3:

voltage is constant:

(6.9)
The solution to this homogeneous differential equation of second order is found
by ﬁrst determining the roots m to the characteristic equation

If current i = 0 at t = 0 then A = −B so that

The constant D is determined by noting that at t = 0 there is neither charge q on
the capacitor nor current i in the circuit so that formula (6.8) gives

Formula (6.15) describes an attenuated oscillating current. The attenuation may
be used to determine L and the oscillation to determine C, assuming R is known.
A typical time dependence is shown in Fig.6.4.
There are many mechanical analogues to this oscillation sequence. Consider for
example a weight connected to a spring. At the turning points the energy is purely
potential and at the equilibrium point the energy is purely kinetic. In the electric RLC
circuit the turning points correspond to a collection of electrons on the capacitor plate
storing purely electric energy. The kinetic energy corresponds to magnetic energy
stored as current in the circuit (compare formula 3.12). The attenuation arises due to
friction, i.e. resistance R. In Exercise (6.7) this analogy is further explored.
6.3.2 Forced Oscillation Circuit
Now let the voltage source generate an oscillating force on the electrons. A resonance
phenomenon will then appear similarly to what would happen if an external force acts
on the spring system as in the previous section. When the frequency of the external
force equals the natural frequency of the spring system very large amplitudes appear
known as resonance.
Assume the battery provides a time-harmonic (sinusoidal) voltage with angular
velocity ωs (index s for ‘source’) which by simplicity is described by a complex
exponential function:
 = 0e jωst
(6.17)
The solution is then complex and the physical current given by its imaginary part.
In analogy with formulas (6.8) and (6.9), the equation becomes (c for complex)

The ﬁrst term is transient since it is damped and vanishes with time. The ﬁnal

which is utilized in resonance circuits. Note that the current in such a circuit is shifted

of different kinds. The voltage source in the circuits above may for example be a

Chapter 7
Electric and Magnetic Dipoles
... every chemical combination is wholly and solely dependent
on two opposing forces, positive and negative electricity, and
every chemical compound must be composed of two parts
combined by the agency of their electrochemical reaction, since
there is no third force. Hence it follows that every compound
body, whatever the number of its constituents, can be divided
into two parts, one of which is positively and the other
negatively electrical.
Jöns Jacob Berzelius, 1819
The following two chapters deal with electric and magnetic dipoles. An electric
dipole is a neutral system consisting of two electric poles with the same amount of
charge but with different signs. A magnetic dipole is described analogously by a
north and a south pole, a terminology which originates from geomagnetism. A more
basic description is a simple current loop.
Dipoles are important for two main reasons:
• As an approximation to systems, both macroscopic and microscopic, in the far
distance.
• As a model for electric and magnetic material properties at a microscopic level.
In this chapter the interaction between a dipole and different objects are discussed.
Particularly important is the interaction energy between two dipoles which will be
derived for both the electric and the magnetic case. These formulas are fundamental
for the dynamics of nature.
Chapter 8 discusses material properties resulting from dipole dynamics.
7.1 Electric Dipole
The electric dipole is illustrated in Fig.7.1. Its poles are point-like and the line
between them reﬂects the fact that the charges are bound to each other. The dipole
properties are given by the charge q and the distance vector l between the poles. The
dipole moment is

and is directed from minus to plus pole.
The interaction between an electric dipole and another object stores electric energy
which can be derived as follows. The dipole is in the potential , associated with the
other object, Fig.7.2. Let the dipole be so small that the distance between its poles
is inﬁnitesimal.
Since U = q(r+) −q(r−) = qd = qd ¯r · ∇, the energy becomes
U = ¯p · ∇
(7.2)
This is the interaction energy between the dipole and the system which generates
the potential .
The force on the dipole is
¯F = −∇U = −∇( ¯p · ∇)

Only the last term is non-vanishing since p is a constant and term no 2 contains
the curl of a gradient which vanishes identically. The force becomes
¯F = −( ¯p · ∇)∇
(7.3)
The dipole also experiences a torque τ:

where θ is the angle between the dipole moment and the gradient of the potential.
The rotation takes place until θ = π, i.e. when p and ∇ are anti-parallel. The
torque is then zero and the energy (7.2) is at a minimum. The sign in the ﬁrst equality
of formula (7.4) is not generally valid but has to be chosen according to the speciﬁc
circumstances. In this case, the minus sign is adequate since the energy decreases
when θ increases from 0 to π.
The direction of a rotational motion is conventionally deﬁned as perpendicular to
the motion according to the right-hand rule, see ﬁgure in Exercise (4.13). The reason
for this deﬁnition can be understood from formula (7.4) since this formula may then
be written as a general cross product
¯τ = −¯p × ∇
(7.5)
This dynamic will now be investigated in a few examples.

7.1.2 Dipole-Dipole Interaction
The next example examines the interaction between two dipoles, e.g. two molecules.
To ﬁnd the energy, the potential generated by a dipole, dipole, is ﬁrst determined.
This is achieved by summing the potentials from the two poles, Fig.7.4.
The potential from a positive point charge is denoted . Thus,
dipole = (|¯r+|) −(|¯r−|) = (|¯r+|) −(|¯r+ + d ¯r|)
= −d ¯r · ∇ =
q
4πε0r2 d ¯r · ˆr =

(7.11)
where r is the distance from the pointlike dipole to the point where the potential
is given. Denote the position vectors of the two dipoles r1 and r2 respectively and
the distance between them R, Fig.7.5. Let the dipole p2 be located in the potential
generated by dipole p1 so that using formula (7.2) energy becomes


¯p1 · ˆR

(7.12)

7.1.3 Interaction Between a Charged Plate and a Dipole
In Sect.(4.1.3) the force between a point charge q and a large homogeneously charged
plate was found to be F = σq/(2ε0) parallel to the surface normal where σ is the
surface charge density of the plate. Since ¯F = −∇U = −q∇, the potential from
the plate, oriented in the yz plane as in Fig.7.6, becomes
 = −σ
2ε0
x
(7.17)
up to a constant which is put to zero. The interaction energy between the plate and
a dipole becomes

(7.18)
where ˆn is the surface normal of the plate. If the dipole is oriented such that it lacks
dipole moment along the surface normal of the plate, the energy is accordingly zero.
The force on the dipole becomes
¯F = −( ¯p · ∇)∇ = 0
(7.19)
since the force on a point charge from a large plate is independent of distance. For
the dipole, the force on the positive and the negative pole are of same magnitude but
are oppositely directed.
However, a torque arises
¯τ = −¯p × ∇ = σ
2ε0
¯p × ˆx = σ
2ε0
¯p × ˆn
(7.20)
which is zero when the dipole moment is parallel or anti-parallel to the plate’s surface
normal ˆn.
7.1.4 Generalized Electric Dipole Moment
An arbitrary charge distribution may be assigned a dipole moment and an approxi-
mate description of its interactions may be obtained using the formulas above.
If a system is regarded as a dipole, its interactions generally have to appear at
a rather large distance. Indeed, a system looks like a point far away and is treated
accordingly as a point charge. With decreasing distance, the system’s structure is
revealed with the dipole structure as the ﬁrst correction to the point character. If the
system’s total charge is zero, its dipole structure is the ﬁrst approximation. At the
next level the quadrupole structure is revealed, next octupole structure and so on.
Based on a series expansion with respect to distance r, the potential can then be
written

where r is the distance from the center of the system to the observation point. O

terms of the multipole expansion. Filled and unﬁlled poles have the same charge but
opposite signs.
Octupole
Quadrupole

Monopole
The multipole theory is further discussed in Exercise (7.1) and in appendices AB.
The generalized electric dipole moment is the geometrical mean of positive charge
minus the negative counterpart. In the discrete case, the formula becomes
¯p =

i
¯riqi
(7.22)
where the sum runs over all charges in the system and ¯ri is the position vector for
charge i.
Usually, systems are continuous and described by a charge density ρ(¯ri). An
inﬁnitesimal volume then contains charge ρ(¯ri)dV and the generalization of formula
(7.22) becomes
¯p =

V
¯rρ(¯r)dV
(7.23)
where V is the volume of the system.
7.2 Magnetic Dipole
The theory of magnetic dipoles and their interactions shares many of its features with
that for electric dipoles.
The idea of a magnetic dipole moment stems from the permanent magnet which
is described in terms of north and south poles together with the effective length
vector between them. This is in analogy with the electric dipole moment. As is now
well-known, magnetism corresponds to charges in motion and the pole description

112
7
Electric and Magnetic Dipoles
is ﬁctitious. In fact, the magnetic properties of a conventional permanent bar magnet
originate from the electric currents ﬂowing on its surface. This will be studied in
detail in Sect.8.2.1.
The bar magnet may be thought of as a number of closed parallel current loops,
Fig.7.7. An ideal theoretical dipole is small and consists of two point-like poles.
Since magnetic charge does not exist the smallest magnetic unit is a dipole. The
smallest possible formation of a magnetic dipole is a point-like permanent magnet,
corresponding to a single closed loop. For reasons of symmetry it must be circular.
In the macrocosm, the exact dipole is really a spherical current distribution and the
simple loop is a good dipole approximation at fairly large distance, see Sect.8.2.2.3.
The question is then what dipole moment should be attributed to this object. The
convention is to deﬁne the magnetic dipole moment analogously to the electric. It is
therefore necessary to investigate how two parallel circular loops interact and then
use the equivalence of formula (7.16) (electric dipole-dipole energy) to deﬁne the
magnetic dipole moment. Let the loops be positioned far from each other so that
they are perceived as small. Their interaction energy is given by formulas (3.19)
and (4.64):
U = μ0I1I2πa2b2
2R3
(7.24)
where a and b are the radii of the respective loop and R is the distance, Fig.7.8.
The direction of a magnetic dipole moment is deﬁned as the surface normal to
the loop, according to the right-hand rule with current as reference direction, see
ﬁgure in Exercise (4.13). For the same current direction, the dipole moments are
parallel and directed along the distance vector R. The currents are treated as constant
so that the force is given by (4.66). As discussed in Sect.3.3.1, the total energy
is then minimized, since it is understood that the currents are maintained by an
external battery.

7.2 Magnetic Dipole

The magnetic dipole moment is deﬁned analogously to the electric. In formula
(7.16) the electric dipole moment is replaced by the magnetic so that the expression
for the interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles with dipole moments m1
and m2 becomes
U = −μ0
4π R3 [ ¯m1 · ¯m2 −3( ¯m1 · ˆR)( ¯m2 · ˆR)]
(7.25)
where 1/ε0 has been replaced by the magnetic permeability μ0. Also, a minus sign
has been introduced since the magnetic energy is maximized for constant currents.
Formula (7.25) is derived in Appendix B.
If the dipole moments are parallel to the distance vector R, as in Fig.7.8, the
energy becomes
U =
μ0
2π R3 m1m2
(7.26)
The energy is positive, which indicates an attractive force. Comparison with for-
mula (7.24) gives
¯m1 = I1πa2 ˆn1
¯m2 = I2πb2 ˆn2
(7.27)
where ˆn is the surface normal. The dipole moment for a circular current loop is thus
its current times its area. This is generally valid for closed loops with a ﬁxed surface
normal.
7.2.1 Interaction Between a Magnetic Dipole and a Large
Current-Carrying Plate
Consider the interaction between a large current-carrying plate and a magnetic dipole.
The latter consists of a single loop which is arbitrarily oriented and carries a constant
current I.
It was shown in Sect.4.2.3 that the force on a current element IdL from a large
current-carrying plate is independent of distance and given by formula (4.45)
d ¯F = Id ¯L × μ0
2 ( ¯K × ˆn)
(4.45)
With the coordinate system as in Fig.7.9 (see also ﬁgure in Exercise 7.9) formula
(4.45) becomes
d ¯F = Id ¯L × ˆy μ0K

where K is current per unit length in the y direction and the plate is parallel to the
yz-plane. The current direction in the plate is parallel to the z axis and its surface
normal ˆn points in the positive x direction.
For a circular loop close to the plate the translational force vanishes since opposite
current elements give opposing forces (d ¯L changes sign). Considering the loop as a
bar magnet, the forces on the ﬁctitious poles cancel since the force is independent of
distance. This is equivalent to the electric dipole’s interaction with a large charged
plate, Fig.7.6.
However, as in the electric case a torque τ arises:
d ¯τ = ¯r × d ¯F = I μ0K

¯r × (d ¯L × ˆy) = I μ0K

where S is the area deﬁned by the circle and d ¯a is a surface element. In the second
equivalence, a version of Stokes’ theorem has been used. In coordinate free form the
torque becomes
¯τ = μ0
2 ¯m × ( ¯K × ˆn)
(7.30)
and the dipole moment of the loop is
¯m = I

S
d ¯a
(7.31)
Thus, the loop orients with its dipole moment either parallel or anti-parallel to the
y axis, depending on the current direction of the plate.

(7.32)
where θ is the angle between the dipole moment m and the y axis, Fig.7.9. Note
that the energy principle for torque is applicable only if the direction of the torque is
along the rotational motion. For reasons discussed in Sect.7.1 the direction of torque
is redeﬁned to become perpendicular to the motion, in accordance with formula
(7.30).
As in the electric case, formula (7.4), the sign of the ﬁrst equality in formula
(7.32) must be determined from the speciﬁc conditions. Referring to Fig.7.9 with
the current K in the positive z direction, the magnetic torque acts so as to turn the
loop towards θ = 0. Consequently dθ < 0, increasing the magnetic energy to a
maximum at the stable equilibrium. Therefore
U = μ0K
2
¯m · ˆy = μ0
2 ¯m · ( ¯K × ˆn)
(7.33)
which is generally valid for loops with a ﬁxed surface normal.
Considering magnetism at an atomic level with electron spins and electron orbitals
as its source, the currents should be treated as constant. As a consequence, the
magnetic interaction energy is maximized. This is why ferro- and paramagnetic
materials are attracted by an external inﬂuence, see Chap.8. Which voltage source
that maintains the current in these cases is a particularly interesting issue.
7.2.2 Induced Voltage in a Rotating Loop Interacting
with a Current-Carrying Plate
In Sect.3.5 Faraday-Henry’s induction law was derived. This will now be applied
to a generator construction. Consider two conductors where conductor 1 carries a

current. A voltage is induced in conductor 2 according to formula (3.32)
ε2 = M12
d
dt I1 + I1
d
dt M12
(7.34)
The second term is a so-called motional induction which arises through a change
of the geometrical relation between the two conductors, achieved either by relative
translational or rotational motion of some segment or the whole conductor.
For example, let conductor 1 be a large plate with a constant current I1 in the
z direction and let conductor 2 be a loop close to the plate, Fig.7.9. Assume the
dipole approximation to be valid for this loop. If the loop is rotating, a voltage will
be induced because of the motional induction term in formula (7.34), which will now
be determined. In principle, Neumann’s inductance formula (3.30) may be utilized
to determine the mutual inductance, which will be time dependent since the angle
between two length elements varies with time. Alternatively, a short-cut through the
energy may be chosen, using formula (7.33). From formula (3.19), the interaction
energy is
U = M12I1I2
(7.35)
Rewriting (7.33) in terms of current such that I1 = KY, where Y is the length of
the plate along y, and ¯m = I2 ¯A = I2 Aˆn2 with A being the area of the loop, energy
becomes
U = μ0

7.2.3 Generalized Magnetic Dipole Moment—Interaction
Between Rotating Cylinders
As a further example of magnetic dipole moment, consider the interaction between
two homogeneously charged rotating cylinders in the dipole approximation. Since the

7.2 Magnetic Dipole
117
magnetic dipole moment formula (7.31) is valid only for closed loops, a generalized
formula must ﬁrst be developed and the dipole moment for this case determined.
Then the magnetic energy is derived utilizing formula (7.25). In addition, there is in
this case also electric energy.
The dipole moment, formula (7.31), is generalized in the following way (see also

valid for an arbitrary current distribution with volume V and current density J,
deﬁned by the relation Id ¯L = ¯JdV , compare formula (2.5) and Exercise (2.24).
Denote the length l, the radius a, the charge Q and the angular velocity about
the cylinder axis ω, Fig.7.10. The coordinate system is chosen such that its origin is
at the centre of the cylinder. The current density is obtained from formula (2.5) as
¯J(r) = ρch ¯v(r) where ρch is charge density and ¯v is the velocity of a charge element
at position r. This motion is due to the rotation of the cylinder so that
¯J(r) = ρch ¯ω × ¯r
(7.40)
Using cylindrical coordinates the position vector is ¯r = ρ ˆρ + zˆz and the current
density becomes ¯J(r) = ρchωρ ˆφ. The integrand of (7.39) may then be written
¯r × ¯J = ρchρ2ωˆz −ρchωρz ˆρ

For equal rotation directions the energy is negative. If the rotational speed is
maintained by an external source, i.e. a constant current is provided, a repulsive
magnetic force results.
In this case, there is an electric force as well, also repelling for like charges.

7.19 The astronomical H line
In the 1950s, the so-called H line was discovered in radio-astronomical
observations, corresponding to microwaves with a wavelength of 21cm. Its
source was identiﬁed as a so-called hyperﬁne splitting of the energy levels
of the hydrogen atom. Since the source is hydrogen, the dominating sub-
stance of stars, it could be used for a precise measurement of the density of
stars and was utilized, among other things, to establish the spiral structure
of the Milky Way.
As is known from high-school physics, atoms are described by quantum
mechanics. According to the Bohr model of the atom, an interaction takes
place by a change in the atom’s energy level. Quantum mechanics has
revealed that a registration of a wavelength of 21cm corresponds to an
atomic energy change of 9.4×10−25 J. What could be its dynamical source
in the hydrogen atom?
It was soon established that its source is the interaction due to the spins of
the proton and the electron in the hydrogen atom, i.e. a spin-spin interaction.
The concept of spin corresponds in the macrocosm to a self-rotation, see
Exercise (7.17). Since the proton and the electron are electrically charged,
their spins are associated with a magnetic dipole moment. These have been
measured by isolating electrons and protons and letting them interact with
an external source, such as a current-carrying coil. The measured values
are:
me = 9.27 × 10−24 Am2
m p = 2.86 × 10−26 Am2

From these data, determine the energy change of the hydrogen atom when
the relative orientation of the proton and electron spins changes from par-
allel to anti-parallel. The spins are oriented perpendicular to the distance,
which in the Bohr model is a0 = 0.5 × 10−10 m (Fig.7.12).
Answer:
From formula (7.25), the energy change is
Um = 2 μ0
4π R3 mem p = 2.1 × 10−25 J
where the factor 2 arises since the two energy levels, corresponding to par-
allel and anti-parallel spins, differ only by sign.
The obtained value is correct in magnitude, indicating that the dynamics is
identiﬁed. The deviation is due to so-called quantum mechanical effects.
These appear because in microcosm it is not possible to consider the objects
as distinct particles; they have an extension in both time and space. This
extension is described by a probability function, expressed with a so-called
wave function, specifying the functional form of the extension. Practically,
it means that the distance R is not unique, but each distance value has to be
weighted against a certain probability. In this case, there is a certain prob-
ability even for R = 0 which will contribute largely to the energy since
there is a division by zero in formula (7.25). However, this is done over
an inﬁnitesimal interval in space so the ﬁnal result is ﬁnite. This effect is
called Fermi’s contact term, named after the discoverer and gives rise to
the dominating part of the energy difference.
This example illustrates the importance of quantum mechanics and could
be a good starting point for its study. Also note that this example connects
microcosm to astronomy, the smallest to the largest.

Material Properties
One of the most immediate consequences of the electrochemical
theory is the necessity of regarding all chemical compounds as
binary substances. It is necessary to discover in each of them the
positive and negative constituents… No view was ever more
ﬁtted to retard the progress of organic chemistry. Where the
theory of substitution and the theory of types assume similar
molecules, in which some of the elements can be replaced by
others without the ediﬁce becoming modiﬁed either in form or
outward behaviour, the electrochemical theory divides these
same molecules, simply and solely, it may be said, in order to
ﬁnd in them two opposite groups, which it then supposes to be
combined with each other in virtue of their mutual electrical
activity… I have tried to show that in organic chemistry there
exist types which are capable, without destruction, of
undergoing the most singular transformations according to the
nature of the elements.

Electric and magnetic material properties are explored via the material’s response
from an external electric and magnetic inﬂuence respectively. The strength and direc-
tion of the response may be derived from the inner structure of the material.
In an approximate model, the material is considered to consist of electric dipoles
(except metals) and magnetic dipoles. By measuring the responding force, informa-
tion on the dipole structure of the material is therefore obtained, within this model.
In this chapter, principal experiments are studied and a theoretical description of
the dipole model is developed. The objective is to establish a connection between
macroscopic (measurable) quantities and the basal microscopic dynamics in the
material.
8.1 Electric Response Forces
A material surrounded by air (vacuum) always responds attractively to an external
electric inﬂuence. The reason is that the external charge attracts opposite charges in
the material which therefore are placed closer to the external agent, Fig.8.1.

To explore the electric material response, an equivalent method as in Fig.5.1 may
be used, Fig.8.2. When a material is introduced into the capacitor, it is observed
that the voltage between the plates decreases. A non-conductive material, a so-called
isolator or dielectric material, affects the voltage much less than a metal. While
metals were discussed in Chap.5, this chapter will focus on the isolator.
According to the discussion in Sect.5.1, the decrease in voltage must be due to a
charge displacement as illustrated in Fig.8.2. The electric response is quantiﬁed by
introducing a parameter called the dielectric constant κe.1 If the voltage without an
inserted material is denoted 1 and the voltage with a material that fully ﬁlls the
space between the plates is denoted 2, the deﬁnition is
κe = 1
2
(8.1)
assuming the material is homogeneous.
Since the voltage always decreases when a material is inserted, κe > 1. For an
ideal metal κe becomes inﬁnite.
The dielectric constant may also be expressed in terms of capacitance, see
Sect.4.1.5. Since the charge Q on the plates is unchanged
κe = 1
2
= Q/C1
Q/C2
= C2
C1
⇒C2 = κeC1
(8.2)
1 The word ‘dielectric’ refers to the dipole character of an isolator. Older name for dielectric constant
is electric relative permittivity with notation ϵr.

so that the capacitance for a material ﬁlled capacitor increases a factor κe compared
to an empty capacitor.
8.1.1 Electric Force Between a Charged Capacitor
and a Material
The electric response forces are usually very small and difﬁcult to observe. Indeed,
in the last section the measurement required a reﬁned meter. An experiment will
now be described where this force becomes observable and then the active force is
calculated. Figure8.3 shows the principal process.
An isolator is placed outside a parallel plate capacitor connected to a battery. It is
observed that the material is drawn into the volume between the plates all the way to
the right edge where the force vanishes. Changing the polarity of the capacitor gives
the same result.
Since the force is extremely small the friction has to be minimized for the material
to move. This may be put into practice by placing the material on an air ﬂow track
(see movie on book’s website).
Alternatively, if the apparatus is turned so that the motion of the material occurs
vertically, the force may be measured by a balance working at a precision of one
milligram. To obtain a measurable force, a high voltage up to 6kV has to be used.
To minimize the inﬂuence of the voltage, the plates have to be placed far away from
the balance, Fig.8.4.
The average force on the material will now be calculated using the energy method.
The energy stored by the capacitor is 1/2 C2, which increases during the process.
Including the battery energy, the total energy will decrease.
Using formula (1.1), the average force is
⟨F⟩= −UTOT
L
(8.3)
where UTOT is the difference in total energy with and without material between the
plates, which becomes

the upper part, the parallel
plates are seen which are
connected to a high voltage
source, located in the rear
UTOT = UD −U0 + UB
(8.4)
where UD and U0 are the capacitor energies with and without material respectively.
UB is the change of the battery energy and
UD −U0 = 1
2C2
(8.5)
The task of the battery is to maintain the voltage between the plates. In this way,
work is performed by increasing the charge on the plates so that
UB = Q = −C2 = −2(UD −U0)
(8.6)
The minus sign in the second equivalence ensures that the stored battery energy
decreases while it is doing work. The total energy change becomes
UTOT = −(UD −U0)
(8.7)
which is negative as expected. Using (8.5)
UTOT = −1
22(CD −C0)
(8.8)

The task is then reduced to determining the capacitance of a partly material ﬁlled
capacitor, Fig.8.5. Assuming an ideal capacitor, it is straight-forward to show that
the capacitance is independent of where in the capacitor the material is placed, see
Exercise (8.2). Letting the material be located at the edge of one of the plates, the
capacitor is equivalent to a series coupling of two capacitors. One of them is fully
ﬁlled with a material with thickness t, denoted C1. The other is empty with thickness
d −t, denoted C2.
Using formula (4.24) for the capacitance of an ideal plate capacitor, the total
capacitance is (see Exercise 5.5)

It is worthwhile to reﬂect upon how this force arises. Consider Fig.8.3. Since the
ideal approximation has been used only vertical forces on the material are expected.
What is the origin of the horizontal force? It is in fact so-called edge effects that are
active in this case. These were neglected in the calculation and appear because of the
ﬁnite size of the plates, see Exercise (5.15). The material will be polarised in such
a way that its negative charges are turned towards the positive plate and vice versa.

134

Material Properties
Thus a net horizontal force appears, see Exercise (8.3). Neglecting these effects in
the calculation is justiﬁed since the average force was calculated. The edge effects
are approximately equal before and after the process and almost cancel out in the
energy difference, formula (8.7).
8.1.2 The Dielectric Constant—Not a Constant
Measurements of the dielectric constant κe show that it depends on:
• Material
• Temperature
• The strength of the external inﬂuence
• The variation frequency of the external inﬂuence.
Within the dipole model, the observations are quite comprehensible. Knowing
that the electric dipoles originate in the material’s molecules, the external inﬂuence
acts in the following way, Fig.8.6:
• It induces a dipole moment by displacing the charge distribution within the mole-
cule
• It creates an alignment of the dipoles through a torque according to formula (7.5).
Referring to Fig.8.6, it may be concluded that a higher degree of alignment of
the dipoles results in a lower voltage between the plates and accordingly a larger
dielectric constant. The degree of alignment varies with the factors above since:
• Higher temperature results in more random dipole motion.
• Stronger external inﬂuence results in a higher degree of alignment.
• Higher frequency results in a lower degree of alignment since it takes time for the
dipoles to align.
Table8.1 shows the dielectric constant for some materials under different condi-
tions.

8.1.3 Bound Charges
The measurement of the dielectric constant κe provides information about the dipole
dynamics within the material. It is in this way a link to the microcosm. To establish
the connection between macroscopic (observable) and microscopic (model depen-
dent) quantities, the vector polarisation ¯P(¯r) is introduced, corresponding to dipole
moment per unit volume. The total dipole moment in the volume V is therefore
¯p =

V
¯P(¯r)dV
(8.12)
The purpose of this section is to establish a relation between the polarisation and
the external inﬂuence.
Polarisation P may be related to the net charge created by the dipoles, so-called
bound charge. Consider a material homogeneously polarised between two charged
metallic plates, Fig.8.7. The voltage between the plates, denoted , is the sum of
the voltages generated by the plates  f and that generated by the material b,
so that
 =  f + b
(8.13)
where the index f refers to free charges and b to bound charges. The free charges
are in this case the conduction electrons of the metallic plates. The voltage from the
bound charges becomes
b =  − f =  f

Note that  f and b have opposite signs (polarity). This formula may be
expressed in terms of surface charge density σ. Using formula (4.23)

(8.15)
where σb is the surface charge density for the bound charges and σ f that for the free

σb = σ f ( 1

(8.16)
The next step is to establish the relationship between polarisation P and bound
charge density. Assume that x in Fig.8.7 is the length of a dipole. Denote with A the
parallel and equal areas of the plates and the material, the bound total charge qb and
the number of dipoles N to obtain
σb = qb
A = qbx
V

V

(8.17)
and
d P
dx = qb
V = ρb
(8.18)
where V is the volume of the material. These two relations are valid in magnitude.
Including the vector property of polarisation ¯P gives, for each coordinate,
σb = ¯P · ˆn
ρb = −∇· ¯P
(8.19)
where ˆn isthesurfacenormalofthematerial.Theminussigninfrontofthedivergence
of ¯P is explained with reference to Fig.8.9: When the dipole moment density P

increases for increasing z, the negative bound charge will dominate over the positive
charge giving a net negative bound charge in the volume.
The relations (8.19) are general and may be used to determine the electric charge
distribution of a material when the polarisation is known.
Next the polarisation is related to the external inﬂuence. Using formula (7.17)
for parallel plates gives σ f =
ε0∇ f
.2 The bound charge density may then be
obtained from formula (8.16) which is introduced in formula (8.19) and the polari-
sation becomes

Special case!
(8.20)
wherethesignis determinedfromthefact that polarisationis directedtowarddecreas-
ing potential. However, formula (8.20) is a special case valid when the external inﬂu-
ence is directed parallel to the surface normal of the material ˆn, i.e. ∇ f ∝ˆn, as in
Fig.8.7. The general case is treated next.
8.1.3.1 Continuity Conditions
The generalization of formula (8.20) may be derived by considering so-called con-
tinuity conditions of the potential at the intersection between two materials.
To illustrate basic principles, materials will be considered which are
• Linear—the material response is proportional to the strength of the external inﬂu-
ence ∇ f
• Isotropic—the material response is directed parallel to the external inﬂuence (see
Exercise 8.12)
• Homogeneous—the dipole structure of the material is independent of position in
the material.
Consider a situation as in Fig.8.8 where the surface normal of the material forms
an arbitrary angle to the direction of the external inﬂuence. The dipoles of the material
align along the direction of the external electric force (effectively) and in this way a
row of bound minus charges line up at the surface of the material. Thus, the material
response is such that a constant potential appears along its surface while along the
surface normal the electric response is such as described previously in formula (8.1).
The following continuity conditions are then valid for the gradient of the potential
at the intersection between a material and air/vacuum:
ˆn · ∇1 = κe ˆn · ∇2
(8.21)
ˆt · ∇1 = ˆt · ∇2
(8.22)
2 Distinguish between  and ∇. For example, in the x direction ∇ = d
dx ˆx ≈

(8.23a)
as the normal component of the gradient of the potential is scaled down a factor κe
in the material compared to air.
According to formula (8.22), there is no such down-scaling for the tangential com-
ponent of polarisation, wherefore it may be written
Pt ˆt = −ε0(κe −1)∇ f t = −ε0(κe −1)∇t
(8.23b)
By summing (8.23a) and (8.23b) polarisation becomes
¯P = −ε0(κe −1)∇
(8.24)
where all quantities are given in the material. Formula (8.24) is the generalisation
of (8.20) and is valid for arbitrary direction of the external inﬂuence. It establishes
the connection between the microscopic quantity polarisation and the macroscopic
quantity potential.
8.1.4 Three Examples of Polarisation
8.1.4.1 Polarised Cylinder
Consider a non-conductive cylindrical homogeneous material polarised by a long
negatively charged bar, Fig.8.9. The cylinder length is L and its plate radius is a.
What is its charge distribution?

8.1 Electric Response Forces

The potential from the bar is the external inﬂuence (see formulas 1.1, 3.5 and
4.6). Introducing a coordinate axis ρ perpendicular to the bar according to Fig.8.9,
the potential and its gradient become

For negative charge densities λ, the polarisation, i.e. the density of dipole
moments, increases with z. Figure8.9 shows a possible conﬁguration.
Since the dipoles turn their positive side towards the bar, a negative charge is
expected on the left plate, a negative net charge in the volume and a positive charge on
the right plate. The total amount of bound charge ought to vanish. These expectations
may be veriﬁed using the formulas above:

The total charge Q of the cylinder is

(8.28)
as expected.
The calculation of the force is left to Exercise (8.4).
8.1.4.2 A Polarised Sphere in Vacuum
To further illustrate the importance of the material shape when dealing with polari-
sation the following case is investigated:
Alinear,isotropicandhomogeneousnon-conductivespherewithradiusa isplaced
between two charged plates. To ﬁnd its polarisation, formula (8.24) is used. As
concluded from formula (8.13), the gradient of the potential in the material may be
written
∇ = ∇ f + ∇b
(8.29)
To determine b consider Fig.8.10 which shows that its source is the bound
charges at the surface of the sphere. Inside the volume, the bound charges cancel
out. Using formula (8.19), the surface charges may be expressed in terms of polari-
sation P:
σb = ¯P · ˆn = P cos θ
(8.30)
The potential is calculated using formula (3.3). Since the polarisation is homoge-
neous, the calculation needs to be done only on the x axis. Placing the origin at the

8.1.4.3 Polarisation of a Large Plate with an Arbitrary Surrounding
Medium
Previously the surrounding medium has implicitly been vacuum. Consider now the
case when the surrounding is an arbitrary substance, e.g. water. Let the object be
a plate parallel to the external inﬂuence consisting of charged parallel plates, as in
Fig.8.2. Formula (8.20) becomes
¯P = ε0∇p −ε0∇w
(8.34)

142
8
Material Properties
where the index p refers to ‘plate’ or ‘particle’ and w stands for ‘water’ (a particle in
water is a common scenario in applications). Since the external inﬂuence is parallel
to the surface normal in this speciﬁc case, the gradient of the potential in the object is
∇p = ∇ f
κp
and ∇w = ∇ f
κw
(8.35)
such that
∇p = κw
κp
∇w
(8.36)
and formula (8.34) becomes
¯P = ε0∇w


(8.37)
Note that the sign of the polarisation depends on whether the dielectric constant of
the surroundings is greater than or less than that of the object. This phenomenon was
ﬁrst discussed by Mossotti (1850) and Clausius (1879). In Exercise (8.18), the object
is a particle in the form of a sphere and thereby the Clausius-Mossotti polarisation
formula is obtained. This forms the basis for e.g. the application dielectrophoresis,
a popular method for separating and identifying cells and molecules in biological
contexts, such as in DNA analysis.
Another practical example is the electric ﬁsh’s polarisation of its surroundings, a
process equivalent to dielectrophoresis, see Exercise (8.20).
8.2 Magnetic Response Forces
Unlike the electric case in air/vacuum, a material’s response to a magnetic inﬂuence
may be either attractive or repulsive. Materials are classiﬁed into four categories w.r.t.
the response: weak and strong attractive and weak and strong repulsive. The latter
case appears for metals at low temperatures when the material becomes so-called
superconductive.
Let the magnetic inﬂuence be a current carrying coil, Fig.8.11.

To describe the magnetic properties of the material, a parameter called the relative
magnetic permeability κm is introduced.3 This is deﬁned as the factor by which the
stored magnetic energy in a coil, or generally in an inductor, changes when a material
is introduced into the coil and ﬁlls it completely, provided the current of the coil is
maintained. This deﬁnition is equivalent to the electric case for constant voltage
which follows from formulas (8.2) and (4.30), see Exercise (8.1).
Consider the situations in Fig.8.11. The current in the coil is maintained by a
battery and the magnetic force acts to increase magnetic energy, compare Sect.3.3.1.
This results in an attractive force for para- and ferromagnetic materials and a repulsive
force for diamagnetic materials.
For an inductor fully ﬁlled with material with relative magnetic permeability κm,
the magnetic energy is
Um = κmU0 = 1
2κm L0I 2
(8.38)
where L is the self inductance of the inductor and the index 0 denotes absence of
material, i.e. air/vacuum. For a coil fully ﬁlled with a material, the self inductance
in lowest order becomes, using formula (4.80)
L = κmμ0N 2S
d
(8.39)
where N is the number of turns, S the cross sectional area of the coil and d its length.
Hence, the inductance changes a factor equal to the relative magnetic permeability.
To measure the permeability, a force formula is needed. Assume the coil is ﬁlled
by the material up to a length z, Fig.8.12. The magnetic energy for this system
becomes in lowest order
Um = 1
2 I 2[κmμ0n2Sz + μ0n2S(d −z)]
(8.40)
where n = N/d is the density of turns, i.e. number of turns per unit length. For a
constant current, formula (3.23) gives the force
¯Fm = ∇Um = dUm
dz ˆz = 1

the force becomes positive and for κm < 1 negative, corresponding to attractive and
repulsive force respectively.

imately in terms of dipoles. Thus, under an external magnetic inﬂuence magnetic
dipoles are induced and aligned in the material. In this section, these dipoles will be
expressed in terms of electric current and in the next section the relation between the
external inﬂuence and the generated magnetization is derived.
To this end, the vector magnetization ¯M(¯r) (not to be confused with inductance
Mi j) is introduced as the density of magnetic dipole moment ¯m:
¯m =

of location in the coordinate system, see Exercise (7.4), its origin may be placed
at the centre of the dipole, Fig.8.13. In this model, the dipoles are assumed to be

¯J = −∇× ¯M

meaning that the direction of M is given by the ‘right hand rule’ as illustrated in
the ﬁgure of Exercise (4.13). Hence, to deﬁne ¯J(¯r) the magnetization M has to be
known in the vicinity of r.
On the surface of a material the concept surface current density K is used, deﬁned
in the following way. Figure8.14 illustrates a bar which is homogeneously magne-
tised in the negative y direction.
On the surface there is a current I. A current element on the surface in the z

(8.53)
where ˆn is the surface normal.
8.2.2 Magnetization from a Magnetic Inﬂuence
A material is magnetized through an external magnetic inﬂuence corresponding to
an electric current. Equivalent to the electric case, this current is referred to as free
while currents arising in the material are referred to as bound. The relation between
magnetization and the external inﬂuence will now be explored in the dipole approx-
imation. While this will be done here within a special case, using the ideal coil as an
external inﬂuence, a general derivation is presented in Appendix C.
Consider a material completely ﬁlling the volume of an ideal coil. The magneti-
zation takes place by increasing the current in the coil from zero to the ﬁnal value I f ,
where f stands for ‘free’. The material is successively magnetized during the process
until the ﬁnal magnetization M is obtained. In this case, the magnetization becomes
independent of coordinates since the coil affects the material homogeneously.
If
M
As is understood from Sect.8.2.1, net currents Ib (b for bound) will arise only on
the surface of a homogeneously magnetized material, Fig.8.14. The energy of the
system is therefore the sum of the coil energy and the interaction energy between
the coil current and the surface current of the material. By equating this energy to
formula (8.38), i.e. the formula deﬁning κm, the sought relation is obtained.
The coil magnetic energy is given by formulas (3.12) and (4.80). Denoting self
inductance L the energy becomes
Ucoil = 1

(8.54)
using coil inductance in lowest order. N is the number of turns, d is the coil length
and S its cross sectional area. Note that the ﬁrst equality is obtained by integrating
from zero to the ﬁnal value I f , thereby the factor 1/2 in front, see formula (3.12).

148

Material Properties
The interaction energy Uint may also be determined through an integration in the
following way. Consider the material as a magnetic dipole with moment m = ibS. In
the utilized dipole model, the magnetization vector ¯M corresponds to the effective
dipole density. The dipole moments of the material are then parallel or anti-parallel
to the dipole moment of the external inﬂuence. According to formula (4.89, Exercise
4.13) the energy change due to a current change is
dUint = ibSμ0
N
d di f
(8.55)
which shall now be integrated from zero to the ﬁnal value I f . Assuming that ib
increases at the same rate as i f , so-called linear materials, a function f (t) may be
introduced with a range from 0 to 1 such that
ib = f (t)Ib,
di f = I f d f (t)
(8.56)
where t denotes time. The interaction energy then becomes

(8.58)
results in the following relation between bound and free current
Ib = (κm −1)N I f
(8.59)
where Ib is the total current ﬂowing on the surface of the material and I f is the
current in one of the loops of the coil. Since IbS = MSd, (8.59) may be expressed
in terms of magnetization M
M = (κm −1) N
d I f
(8.60)
where M is directed along the axis of the coil according to the dipole orientation.
For κm > 1 the dipoles of the material align parallel to the dipole moment of the
external inﬂuence while for κm < 1 they align anti-parallel.
While (8.60) was obtained for a special case, where the material is surrounded
by an ideal coil, a general formula will now be presented. Here it will be motivated
within the chosen special case. In Appendix C the formula is fully derived.

8.2 Magnetic Response Forces
149
Using formulas (8.57) and (8.60) magnetization may be written
M = (κm −1) 2Uint
μ0mb
(8.61)
where mb = IbS is the total magnetic dipole moment of the material. This may be
vectorized by noting that its direction is given by the dipole moment mb
¯M = (κm −1) 2Uint
μ0mb
ˆmb
(8.62)
This is a general formula for magnetization in the dipole approximation and should
be compared to the electric counterpart (8.24).
The interaction energy, generally given by formula (8.88) and for homogeneous
magnetization by formula (8.57), is in the dipole approximation given by formula
(7.25):
Uint = −1
2
μ0
4π R3 [ ¯mb · ¯m f −3( ¯mb · ˆR)( ¯m f · ˆR)]
(8.63)
where in this case there is a factor 1/2 in front since the magnetization is induced.
Hence, Uint is proportional to mb meaning that mb vanishes from the right-hand
side of (8.62). However, the direction ˆmb remains, obtained using formula (7.45) in
Exercise (7.15).
A few examples will now be discussed.
8.2.2.1 A Material on the Axis of the Inﬂuencing Loop
Consider an interaction between a current-carrying loop and a material, placed at a
distance x on the extended axis of the loop, Fig.8.15. What is the interaction energy
and the material’s magnetization? Let the distance be large enough to ensure that the
dipole approximation is valid.
In this case the two dipole moments are parallel/anti-parallel to each other as well
as to the distance vector. Formula (8.63) gives the interaction energy for parallel
moments

The magnetization M is obtained from (8.61) as
M = (κm −1) I f S f

(8.65)
where m f = I f S f . Since mb = MV , where V is the volume of the material, the
interaction energy becomes
Uint =

(8.66)
Hence, the force between the objects decreases as 1/x7, see Exercise (8.9). Note
that the direction of the force is independent of the direction of the free current.
8.2.2.2 A Material Off the Axis of the Inﬂuencing Loop
Now consider an interaction between a current loop and a material placed at an
arbitrary position, Fig.8.16. As in the previous section, the dipole approximation is
assumed.
The interaction energy and the magnetization will be determined using formulas
(8.63) and (8.62) respectively. To this end, the relative orientation between ¯mb and
¯m f has to be found. According to formula (7.45) in Exercise (7.15) the relationship
between the angles in Fig.8.16 is

8.2.2.3 Magnetization of a Sphere/Cylinder
In this section the signiﬁcance of the shape of the material when it comes to magneti-
zation is explored, equivalent to the electric case which was discussed in Sect.8.1.4.2.
Spherical form
Consider ﬁrst a permanently homogeneously magnetized sphere. To ﬁnd its magnetic
properties, its interaction with a small current loop, i.e. a point-like magnetic dipole,
is investigated. Let the magnetization of the sphere be directed along the z axis, so
that ¯M = M ˆz. Denote the dipole moment of the current loop m2, directed along z
and located somewhere on the z axis, Fig.8.17.

Fig. 8.17 A small magnetic dipole m2 on the z axis interacts with a homogeneously magnetized
sphere (left). The interaction is modelled as a sum of inﬁnitesimal interactions between the dipole
m2 and circular rings on the surface of the sphere. The rings have radius x′ and carry current dIb
(right)

8.2 Magnetic Response Forces
153
The calculation of the interaction energy is performed by dividing the sphere into
parallel inﬁnitesimal rings located on the surface of the sphere. Here the surface
current density is ¯Kb = Kb ˆφ in spherical coordinates. These current rings and the
current of the dipole m2 are accordingly concentric. Note that inside the sphere there
are no currents. The task is to sum pairwise interactions between each of these rings
and the dipole m2, equivalent to the case treated in Sect.4.2.5.1 for an interaction
between two circular coaxial currents.
The interaction energy is obtained from the mutual inductance (4.56). Since the
dipole m2 is small, the quantity k2 ≪1 in formula (4.56). Consequently, formula
(4.63) may be used to calculate the mutual inductance.4 Treating the dipole m2 as
a circular current loop with current I2 and radius b and using x′ as the radii of the
rings on the sphere, the inﬁnitesimal interaction energy becomes

where x′ ≫b has been used and z′ is the z coordinate for the inﬁnitesimal ring of
the sphere, Fig.8.17.
Making the substitution x′ = a sin θ and z′ = a cos θ and from formula (8.53)
dIb = Kadθ = M sin θadθ, we obtain
dUint = μ0

Note that the result for z ≥a implies that the sphere and the dipole m2 interact

sphere is equivalent to an exact dipole, as long as it is viewed from the outside.

(8.81a)
Letting z = l/2 and l →∞, the energy becomes Uint = μ0m2M. This is the
interaction between a long coil and a magnetic dipole placed inside the coil which was
treated in Exercise (4.13). From formula (4.89), it is realised that the magnetization
of the long coil is
MC = N I f /l
(8.81b)
where N is the number of turns and f denotes ‘free’. Formula (8.81b) is in accordance
with formula (8.53).
Sphere under external inﬂuence
Next consider a sphere that is being homogeneously magnetized by an ideal coil.
What is the relation between the magnetization M and the current of the external
inﬂuence?
For the equivalent calculation in the electric case, Sect.8.1.4.2, the concept of
potential  was utilized. For the magnetic case there is no such counterpart, since its
source is electric current. Instead, the energy concept is used. While for the electric
case the potential from the bound charges, b, was calculated within the material, for
the magnetic case the interaction energy between an internal dipole of the material
and the rest of the material is considered. This internal dipole also interacts with
the external coil, so that the total interaction energy becomes the sum of these two
sources. Equating this sum to formula (8.61), fully derived in Appendix C, the sought
relation between the material magnetization M and the external inﬂuence is found.
Denote the magnetization of the sphere and the coil MS and MC = N I f /l respec-
tively, where the latter is formula (8.81b). For the case (κm −1) > 0, corresponding
to e.g. a paramagnetic material, the material response is such that its current appears
in the same direction as the inﬂuence, i.e. MS and MC are parallel.
Consider now a small internal dipole with moment mb inside the spherical material
located in a small cavity, Fig.8.18 (upper). For a homogeneous magnetized material

there are no net currents inside the volume. However, for the inner surface of the
cavity there will be net currents oppositely directed to the surface currents of the
sphere. Hence, the internal interaction energy of the material is of opposite sign
compared to the interaction between the material and the coil.
Consider ﬁrst the internal interaction energy, i.e. the energy in the interaction
between the internal dipole and the rest of the material. Using formula (8.79) for
z ≤a, it may be obtained in the following way. The coil magnetizes the sphere to the
magnetization MS. Had the object been without any form, i.e. of inﬁnite extent, the
energy between the internal dipole and the rest of the material would be 1
2μ0mbMS,
according to formula (4.89). The extra factor 1/2 appears since the energy is induced
in analogy with formula (8.57). Using formula (8.79), the total energy between the
internal dipole and the magnetized sphere is 1
2μ0 2
3mbMS, corrected for the inducing
process. However, this energy includes the interaction with the magnetizing coil
since the magnetization of the sphere is generated by the coil.

Formula (8.82) is equivalent to formula (8.32) for the electric case. The difference in

The two formulas (8.33) and (8.87) have equivalent structures and are also gen-
eralized in the same way for an interaction in arbitrary medium. In the electric case,
the resulting formula is known as Clausius-Mossottis formula, see Exercise (8.18).
This generalization of formulas (8.86) and (8.87) is used in applications equiva-
lent to dielectrophoresis, i.e. to separate and control microscopic particles, a method
accordingly known as magnetophoresis.

8.4 Measurement of Electric and Magnetic Material
Properties
The dielectric constant κe and the relative magnetic permeability κm may in principle
be measured using the methods outlined above. Practically, however, these should
be considered as just qualitative investigations. In the electric case, Fig.8.2, a high
voltage is used since the volt meter requires a high internal resistance and therefore
operates at voltages of several kV. As a consequence, discharge effects appear making
the conditions unstable. In the magnetic experiment, Fig.8.11, small forces are active
(except for so-called ferromagnetic materials) which are therefore hard to measure.
Also in its electric counterpart, Figs.8.3 and 8.4, the force becomes too small for a
precise measurement.
Some practical methods for the measurements of material parameters will now
be discussed. First solids are considered and then liquids.

Material Properties
8.4.1 Measurements on Solids
Since the material parameters κe and κm may be regarded as the factor by which
capacitance and inductance respectively change when introducing materials, see
formulas (8.2) and (8.39), these quantities may be measured in RC and RL circuits
as discussed in Chap.6.
Consider ﬁrst the charging and discharging time for a capacitor fully ﬁlled with
a material connected in series with a resistance R. The half-time, formula (6.4),
becomes
T1/2 = κeC0R ln 2
(8.90)
where C0 is the capacitance without material. Hence, the measurement of half-time
gives a value of the dielectric constant provided the capacitance C0 is known.
For the magnetic case, the current growth in a material ﬁlled coil connected in
series with a resistance R is investigated. Formula (6.7) gives the half-time
T1/2 = κmL0
R
ln 2
(8.91)
where L0 is the inductance for an empty coil. Using a good oscilloscope precision
measurements may in this way be performed. An interesting investigation is to ﬁll
a coil with diamagnetic materials with κm < 1, such as copper and bismuth, and
accordingly register a decrease of half-time. The effect is small and challenging to
measure.
8.4.2 Measurements on Liquids
In case of measuring on liquids, a direct force action may be utilized.
Consider ﬁrst the electric case. Let a coaxial cylindrical capacitor be in contact
with the surface of a liquid, Fig.8.19. When a voltage is applied between the con-
ductors, an attractive force acts on the liquid in analogy with Figs.8.3 and 8.4. The
liquid is then drawn into the capacitor to a height h which depends on the dielectric
constant of the liquid. Their relation will now be derived using the energy principle.
Three types of energies are involved in the process: gravitational, battery and
electric energy. The ﬁnal height h is found from energy minimization: The energy
change becomes
U = Ue + Ugr + UB = −Ue + Ugr
(8.92)
since, according to Sect.4.1.7, the change of battery energy at a constant voltage is
twice that of the electric energy change, see formula (4.36).
The change in electric energy is Ue = 1

Fig. 8.19 Left A cylindrical capacitor is placed on the surface of a liquid. Right When a voltage is
applied between the conductors the liquid is drawn into the capacitor

(8.93)
where L is the length of the cylinders and their radii are a and b with a < b. In the
ﬁnal state, the capacitor corresponds to a parallel coupling of two capacitors, one is
fully ﬁlled with liquid and the other is empty. Therefore, the capacitance C is the
sum of the individual capacitances.
The change in gravitational energy becomes
Ugr = ρπ(b2 −a2)hg h

(8.94)
where ρ is the density of the liquid and h/2 is the height of the liquid’s centre of
gravity inside the capacitor. The total energy change then becomes

(8.97)
As was discussed in Sect.8.1.1 the force arises due to edge effects, which are how-
ever neglected in the calculation. This is motivated since these effects are unchanged
from the initial to the ﬁnal state and are therefore cancelled in the end.
The magnetic permeability for liquids may be measured similarly, using the so-
called Quincke method. A u-tube is ﬁlled with the liquid with one leg placed inside
a coil, Fig.8.20. When the coil carries a current it interacts with the liquid in analogy
with Fig.8.11. These ﬁgures illustrate the case of an attractive interaction. However,
diamagnetic materials will respond with a repulsive force. The height h is directly
related to the relative magnetic permeability, now shown using the energy principle.
As in the previous case there are three forms of energies to be considered: the
magnetic, the battery and the gravitational. The energy change becomes
U = Um + UB + Ugr = −Um + Ugr
(8.98)
using the fact that the change of the battery energy is twice that of the magnetic
energy change for constant currents, see Sect.3.3.1.
In the ﬁnal state, the coil is partly ﬁlled with liquid and its inductance is denoted
L. The inductance of the initially empty coil is denoted L0. Using formula (4.80) in
lowest order, the magnetic energy change becomes

in the lowest order of formula (4.80), see Exercise (4.14).
The total energy change becomes

Permeability for solids may also be measured in this way by preparing a solution
with e.g. water. By measuring at different concentrations an extrapolation of data can
be done down to zero concentration which then corresponds to pure water. In this
way the diamagnetic property of water may be observed, see Table8.2 and Exercise
(8.11).
8.5 Summary
Both electric and magnetic material properties may be understood within a model
assuming the material to consist of dipoles. In the electric case these dipoles corre-
spond to molecular charge displacements (except for metals). In the magnetic case
the dipoles are current loops at the atomic level, including the conduction electrons.

8.12 Anisotropic materials
Therearematerialswhoseresponsetoanexternalinﬂuenceisnotdescribed
as a dipole alignment along the direction of the inﬂuence. These materi-
als are called anisotropic. The ﬁgure illustrates this phenomenon in two
dimensions for the electric case to the left and for the magnetic case to the

dipoles, placed at the corners of a square with the side a. All dipoles form
an angle θ with the vertical and their dipole moment is p.
*8.14 The Hall sensor
A Hall sensor is used to measure the magnetic interaction between a mag-
netized (current-carrying) object and a straight current generated in the
sensor. The ﬁgure shows the principles of the sensor in an interaction with
an idealized coil (Fig.8.23).
The Hall element, oriented in the xy plane in the ﬁgure, consists of a
metallic rectangular plate where a voltmeter V is connected over two par-
allel side plates as in the ﬁgure. A Hall current IH through the plate will
interact magnetically with the coil current. This will cause the electrons of
the Hall current to be displaced to one side of the Hall element. A voltage
builds up over the Hall element whose magnitude depends on the strength
of the two currents as well as on the relative orientation between the cross
sectional surface normals of the two objects. This voltage gives rise to an
electric force that counteracts the magnetic force. At equilibrium between
these two forces the voltage is registered by the voltmeter.
Show that this voltage is given by
 = vμ0Kl cos θ
(8.102)
where v is the drift velocity in the Hall sensor, K is the current density of
the coil, l is the distance between the Hall plates and θ is the angle between
the surface normals of the objects.
Hint: According to Exercise (7.12) the idealized coil may be considered as
two parallel large plates with opposite current directions so that the force
on the Hall current becomes twice that of formula (4.46).
Since the drift velocity and the dimensions of the Hall sensor are known,
the measurement provides the current density K of the coil.

Ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel exhibit a strong
attractive magnetic response to an external inﬂuence. In addition, κm is
strongly dependent on the strength of the external inﬂuence and they may
also be magnetized permanently, i.e. the magnetization remains after the
inﬂuence has ceased. Such a material’s magnetic properties may be illus-
trated through a hysteresis curve (from the greek word hystera meaning
womb), see ﬁgure (Fig.8.24).
The curve is registered in the following way:

C 8.16 Electric hysteresis
Ferroelectric materials, such as KNO3 and BaTiO3, are able to be perma-
nently polarised. Also, their dielectric constants vary with the strength of
the external inﬂuence. Similarly to the ferromagnetic case, Exercise (8.15),
the material exhibits a hysteresis effect according to Fig.8.25. Note that
compared to the magnetic case, the axes are interchanged.

moment the particles are displaced a certain distance during this time
interval from which their characteristics can be obtained (Fig.8.27).

Motional Consequences
I have long held an opinion, almost amounting to conviction, in
common I believe with many other lovers of natural knowledge,
that the various forms under which the forces of matter are made
manifest have one common origin; or, in other words, are so
directly related and mutually dependent, that they are convertible,
as it were, one into another, and possess equivalents of power in
their action.
Michael Faraday, 1845
The previous Chaps.1–8 form together a summary of classical electromagnetic
theory. This theory is based upon three forces: the electric, magnetic and induc-
tive. Since they all originate from electric charge, the question arises whether there
is a connection amongst these forces, i.e. are they aspects of one single force? In
Chap.2 it was shown that the magnetic and inductive forces depend on the motion of
the charges and it was indicated that these forces should be considered as corrections
to the electric force.
To understand why these motional consequences occur, this chapter introduces a
model of the electromagnetic interaction based on the assumption that force action is
established by an exchange of momentum mediated at a ﬁnite speed. In this way, the
electric force will depend on the motion of the charges and the magnetic and inductive
forces arise naturally. The relation amongst the three forces is then conceptually
clariﬁed.
While this analysis is done within a special case, which is the parallel motion
as in Fig.9.1, the general derivation is contained in the theory of special relativity.
From Sect.9.4, this theory will be in focus. Its starting point is the so-called time
dilation, meaning that the perception of time depends on the motion of the observer.
By deﬁning time through the concept of motion, it is shown that time dilation results
as a consequence of the magnetic force.
The exercise section contains a tutorial for additional development of the theory
of relativity.

9.1 Modelling the Electrodynamic Interaction
To be able to see the relation between the three electrodynamic forces, the complexity
of the phenomena must be reduced to a minimum. In fact, the issue may be explored
using the smallest constituent of nature: the pairwise mutual interaction between two
fundamental electrically charged objects, e.g. two electrons, Fig.9.1.
Effects of motion appear if interactions take time, i.e. the momentum is mediated
at a ﬁnite speed. In addition, to derive the magnetic and inductive forces as motional
consequences it turns out that the speed of the mediation must be independent of the
speed of the charges.
Thus, the following starting points are obtained:
• The electric force is known.
• Forces are mediated at a ﬁnite speed.
• The mediation speed is independent of the objects’ motion.
9.2 Magnetism as a Motional Consequence
What is the origin of the magnetic force, i.e. what is its relation to the electric force?
In Fig.9.1, the two forces are separated. In reality only the effect of the resulting net
force is observed, so the question may be formulated:
Why is the force between two like electric charges in parallel motion less than
that when they are at rest?
Provided the interactions in some way are mediated at a ﬁnite speed, i.e. interac-
tions take time, the effective distance over which the charges interact is altered when
they move. Figure9.2 illustrates that the effective distance between the two charges
in motion is R∗> R.
Let w be the velocity at which the interaction is mediated, independent of the
motion of the source and directed along the effective distance R∗. Denote the time
it takes to establish the interaction in motion by T = R∗/w.

provided that the mediation speed is w = 1/√ε0μ0 (show this). Conventionally, w
is referred to as the speed of light and is denoted by c, i.e. c = 1/√ε0μ0.
Formula (9.3) is identiﬁed as the electric force, formula (2.1), acting at the distance
R∗.Theinteraction,whichhaspreviouslybeenregardedasanelectricplusamagnetic
force, is accordingly a sole electric force acting at a distance R∗. This distance
increases with the speed v. Note however that the force is directed horizontally, i.e.
along R, not along the distance of mediation R∗.
The conclusion of this section is thus:
The magnetic force is ﬁctitious, arising as a motional consequence of the electric
force which in turn is an effect of interactions taking time.

Motional Consequences
9.3 Induction as a Motional Consequence
In Sect.2.3, the source of induction was found to be the accelerated charge described
by formula (3.34). The force on charge 2 due to acceleration of charge 1 is
¯find = −μ0q2q1
4π R
d¯v1
dt
(3.34)
Induction will now be considered in the interaction as in Fig.9.1. Momentum is
transferred from one object to the other along the distance vector R∗according to
Fig.9.3. Consider three moments in time. The time between two of these moments
is denoted by T , the speed by v and the distance between the objects by R. The
electromagnetic force is known to be horizontal, directed along the distance vector
R between the objects. At time t = t2, object 2 (on the right) receives momentum
from object 1. Since interactions take time, this momentum is transported along the
line R∗. The momentum which is received by object 2 at t = t2 was emitted by object
1 at time t1 (so-called ‘retarded interaction’). Consequently, the received momentum
will result in a diagonal upward force, i.e. along R∗. Thus, there is a force which is
vertical and the sum of this and the electromagnetic force equals the total force ftot,
Fig.9.3.
At the next instance object 2 emits an impulse to object 1 resulting in a down-
ward recoiling force (not drawn in Fig.9.3) so that the vertical forces cancel out.
This is necessary or else the objects would accelerate vertically which is physically
impossible.
The vertical force is presumed to be the inductive find, formula (3.34), since it is
oppositely directed and proportional to the acceleration of its source, object 1, which

recoils diagonally downward at t = t1. The purpose is now to derive this force and
thereby verifying (3.34).
Since an acceleration dependent force is sought, the question arises: what accel-
eration would the vertical force cause if it were not cancelled by the corresponding
opposite vertical force? As is worked out in Exercise (9.3), a vertical single force
acting downwards would decelerate the object from v to 0 during time T , i.e. with
acceleration a = v/T . From the geometry in Fig.9.3 it is then established that

9.4 Special Theory of Relativity
9.4.1 Relative Motion
A parallel motion, Fig.9.1, will now be utilized to introduce the special theory of
relativity. The ﬁrst step in this theory is to deﬁne the concept of relative motion.
The velocity v in Fig.9.1 has to be related to something. Apparently, the objects
are at rest relative to each other so the velocity v must relate to the motion of an
observer. Galileo formulated the principle of relative motion: there is no absolute
motion, all motion must be expressed relative to something.
Einstein embraced this principle when he examined electrodynamics based on
a well-known phenomenon illustrated in Fig.9.4, compare Exercise (3.9). In the
left-hand ﬁgure the magnet approaches the non-moving loop and vice versa in the
right-hand ﬁgure. The induced current depends only on the relative motion.
The principle of relative motion may be extended by introducing an observer who
examines the pairwise interaction between two identical charges, Fig.9.5.

approaches a coil and vice
versa. The same induction
current arises in both cases

The two upper cases are identical because the relative motion is the same. If the
two lower cases are compared it is concluded that a magnetic force may be generated
solely by putting oneself in motion. The magnetic force is therefore ﬁctitious because
it arises due to the motion of the observer. Compare this to the coriolis and centrifugal
forces which are also ﬁctitious as they are generated via motional effects. These
three phenomena are therefore not referred to as forces but as ‘effects’ (meaning
‘consequence’). However, the observer in Fig.9.5 only observes the total force, or
rather the change in horizontal motion, i.e. the acceleration. In case b, a slower
repulsive motion is observed than in case c.
The total force between the objects thus depends on the motion relative to the
observer which can seem peculiar as the observer does not affect the objects. Should
not the relative motion of the objects to each other be the sole source of inﬂuence on
the force with which they interact? It is at this stage that the new physics introduced
by relativity theory becomes apparent: the observer is a part of the course of events.
Thatthisisapartofrealityisconﬁrmedbytheeventsinaparticleacceleratorwhere
a collection of identical objects, e.g. electrons, are accelerated in close proximity. It
is observed that the repulsion between them becomes vanishingly small for speeds
close to the speed of light even though they are at rest relative to each other. However,
for the accelerator physicist, i.e. the observer, they are travelling close to the speed of
light. The fact that the forces between the particles almost vanish in the ﬁnal phase
of a particle accelerator is also a condition for its function as otherwise it would be
difﬁcult to obtain a stable beam of particles.
The effect of the relative motion on the observation itself is the very foundation
for the theory of relativity. The interpretation of the result that the force between
charges depends on the motion of the observer is in part that the motion affects
the experienced course of time. To understand this interpretation one must ponder
the concept of time. The basic clock is naturally the motion of the earth; the day
and the year. Other clocks are based on other types of repeated motion, such as the
pendulum and atomic clocks. Time in physics is therefore nothing else but a measure
of a motion in relation to a reference.
That the observer in case b interprets the observation by saying that time runs
slower is therefore natural. One can relate to so-called ‘slow motion’-effects in

9.4 Special Theory of Relativity
179
movies. When it is played at a slower pace, all motion is slower and time is experi-
enced as slower. The observer in motion therefore sees the process in ‘slow motion’
and interprets this as time is passing slower.
When the relative motion reaches the speed of light, i.e. v = c = 1/√ε0μ0,
the magnetic effect and the electric force cancel each other (see formula 2.24) and
the repulsive force ceases, time stands still. This conclusion must be valid also for
speedsgreaterthanthatoflight.Tounderstandwhathappenswhentherelativemotion
approaches the speed of light, consider Fig.9.2. It may be noted that the distance over
which the momentum is mediated increases with relative speed to become inﬁnitely
large at and above the speed of light. Then no momentum mediation can take place.
9.4.2 Time Dilation
The above discussion will now be quantiﬁed by formulating the relativity of time,
the so-called time dilation.
An observation is a registration of an object’s change in motion in terms of space
and time coordinates. Other concepts, such as mass, force and charge are abstract.
They are part of the descriptive model that is used to comprehend reality. Since the
space coordinates are included in the distance vector R, perpendicular to the motion
of the observer in Fig.9.5, it is assumed that these are not dependent on the observer
in this case. The observers at rest and in motion, cases c and b in Fig.9.5, are doing the
same horizontal motion, i.e. none. Thus, only the time coordinate remains. Assume
that there is a linear relationship between the time intervals which are perceived by
the observer in motion dt and at rest dt0, i.e. dt = γ dt0 where γ depends on v.
The repulsive motion that is observed (for like charges) is given by Newton’s law of
force. In case b in Fig.9.5, i.e. for the observer in motion, the following repulsion is
obtained (see formula 2.24)

is considered as constant since a description in terms of the coordinates is sought.

(9.9)
where v is the relative motion between the object and the observer (vertically in
Fig.9.5). The formula reﬂects the fact that v < c.
9.4.3 Relativistic Momentum
The time dilation together with the principle of relative motion cause a violation of
momentum conservation as illustrated in the following example.
Consider an interaction between two identical objects in anti-parallel motion,
Fig.9.6. In the upper diagram the observer’s motion is such that the two objects have
the same speed in opposite directions. In the lower diagram the observer is moving
together with the right charge in its vertical motion.
Due to time dilation, the moving observer perceives a slower horizontal (trans-
verse) motion of the leftward charge as compared to the rightward charge. The elec-
tromagnetic interaction would thus result in a change of momentum which is less for
the leftward charge than for the rightward one. This would violate Newton’s third
law, the principle of action and reaction, and accordingly the principle of momentum
conservation.
To respect this fundamental principle, the expression for the transversal momen-
tum needs to be made invariant, i.e. independent of the vertical motion of the observer.
One way of doing this is to redeﬁne the concept of mass such that the diminishing
horizontal motion is compensated by a larger mass. The higher the speed relative
to an observer the higher the mass becomes. In the lower diagram of Fig.9.6, the
leftward charge has a higher vertical speed than the rightward charge relative to the
observer and thereby a larger mass of the leftward charge is anticipated.

where m is the mass which is perceived at relative rest and is henceforth denoted
by m0. To achieve invariance of the momentum, i.e. independence of the observer’s
motion v, it is necessary to multiply the momentum by γ . By multiplying the right-
hand as well as the left-hand side of formula (9.10) by γ we obtain

The relativistic momentum is thus by deﬁnition
¯prel = m0γ d ¯R
γ dt0
= m0γ d ¯R
dt
(9.12)
It is this quantity that fulﬁls Newton’s principle of action and reaction and is
therefore conserved in the processes of nature.
Note that the right-hand side of formula (9.11) is the redeﬁned electromagnetic
force. The force formula has been rewritten such that the repulsion which is observed
in e.g. Fig.9.5b is partly caused by the electromagnetic force and partly by a mass
change. This reinterpretation is justiﬁed since both mass and force are abstract con-
cepts, i.e. not directly observable.
The transverse momentum is now equal for the two observers but not the motion
itself. The repulsion in Fig.9.5 is still slower for the observer in relative motion
whereby time dilation arises.
9.4.4 Relativistic Energy
The new deﬁnition of momentum, formula (9.12), will result in a new deﬁnition of
energy. Consider the kinetic energy a single object acquired under the inﬂuence of
an external force, see Fig.9.7.
In formula (9.12), γ = 1/

1 −v2/c2 where v is the vertical velocity while
d ¯R/dt is the horizontal velocity. In Fig.9.7 the object’s direction of motion coincides
with the motion relative to the observer wherefore the momentum of the object may
be written

m
Fig. 9.7 A person observes the acceleration of an object along the x axis
¯p = γ (u)m0 ¯u
(9.13)
where u is the speed of the object. This is the general expression for momentum.
Newton’s force law is thus
¯F = d ¯p
dt = d
dt γ (u)m0 ¯u
(9.14)
Here, the time coordinate t is time dilated as the process takes place in relative
motion. The time coordinate is also included in the speed ¯u = dx/dt ˆx.
Through the deﬁnition of work as force times distance, relativistic kinetic energy
will now be derived. Let the external force F affect the object so that it accelerates
from initial speed 0 at x = 0 to the ﬁnal speed v at x = X. Consider the case when
no other forces are acting so that potential energy can be neglected. All work will
then be transformed into kinetic energy, W = Ekin, which becomes:

A crucial difference from the Newtonian expression is that one of the terms does
not depend on the velocity v. The conventional interpretation is that m0c2 is to be
considered as rest energy and m0c2/

1 −v2/c2 as the total energy ET OT . It may
therefore be written
ET OT = Ekin + m0c2
(9.16)
which is the energy expression that is conserved in nature. Note however that in
general there is also a potential energy appearing on the right-hand side of formula
(9.16).
The energy of an object at rest is
ET OT = m0c2
(9.17)
which is interpreted such as the mass of the object in itself corresponds to a certain
amount of energy.
The work W will convert into the classical expression for kinetic energy at low
speeds which may be shown by series expanding the expression:

The fact that the relativistic expression turns into the classical one for low speeds
is a general principle. It also applies to momentum and mass.
In classical physics, the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy
is E = p2/(2m). In the relativistic case p = m0v/

In Exercise (9.5), formula (9.20) is used as a starting point for the deﬁnition of
so-called four-vectors.
9.5 Summary
Both the magnetic and the inductive force are motional consequences of the electric
force and can be derived from the fact that interactions take time; they are mediated at
the speed of light. These motional consequences are commonly known as ‘relativistic

*9.4 Length contraction
The muon is a non-stable particle decaying into an electron and a so-called
neutrino. The life time for a muon at rest is τ0 = 2.2µs.
Muons are part of the cosmic radiation towards the earth and can be identiﬁed
using e.g. scintillation detectors. In a classic experiment, the number of muons
at a certain height above the earth was investigated and compared to the number
of muons at the surface. During a certain time interval, 5.0 × 104 muons were
identiﬁed at the altitude 3.0km and 1.1 × 104 were identiﬁed at the surface of
the earth. The speed of the muons was determined to be v = 0.95c.

The formula for radioactivity is assumed to be valid for the decay of the muons:

where τ is the life time of the muon.

the same time interval

b. With the relativistic effect.
Now consider the issue in the rest system of the muon. The number of
muons at the surface of the earth should be the same as before, but the life
time of the muon for this observer is that at rest τ0 = 2.2µs.

*9.5 Four-vectors—four-dimensional space-time
Relativistic effects, i.e. motional consequences originating in time dilation
(equivalent to the magnetic effect), were interpreted by Minkowski as evidence
for a four-dimensional world with time as the fourth dimension. The starting
point for this interpretation is the identiﬁcation of so-called invariants. These
are quantities independent of the motion of the observer and are formed from
the magnitude of a four-dimensional vector. In this exercise and the next one,
two such four-vectors shall be deﬁned.

nates in these systems are related.
Let the observer O be at rest whereas the observer O’ is moving with the
velocity v in the x direction according to the ﬁgure below. Assume that they
observe an event H (e.g. a spider that spins its web) and wish to describe
the coordinates of the event in time and space. Let their coordinate systems

y′ = y

become

Determine thereby the elements of the metric tensor gμν.
The metric tensor has a fundamental role in the general theory of relativity
dealing with so-called curved space-time. In special theory of relativity,
space-time is ﬂat.
b. Convince yourself that on a curved surface, such as the surface of an orange,
a different metric tensor is obtained than that for a ﬂat surface.
Hint: When forming the invariant (9.24), the starting point was Pythagora’s
theorem. Is this valid on a curved surface?
Starting from this exercise, one may begin to examine the general theory of
relativity dealing with general motions of observers, i.e. including accelera-
tion.

Motional Consequences
9.14 The magnetic effect between two charges in parallel motion, Fig.9.2, has a
natural conceptual explanation according to Sect.9.2.
Consider the perpendicular motion, Fig.2.9. Is it possible to ﬁnd a natural
explanation also in this case within the model that has been used for the par-
allel motion?
Answer: The problem here is that it is not possible to ﬁnd a reference system
where both charges are at rest which is necessary for the Coulomb force for-
mula to be valid.
9.15 In this chapter it has been established that the magnetic and inductive dynam-
ics are motional consequences of the electric force.
With this in mind, consider Exercise (2.23) once more.
Ref: K. Prytz, Sources of inertia in an expanding universe, Open Physics, 13
(2015) 130
9.16 Is the quantity temperature relative, i.e. is the observed temperature for a sys-
tem dependent on the motion of the observer?
What is the limit value of the temperature when the observer approaches light
speed?
Answer: The impossibility of travelling at or above the speed of light may
also be realised using thermodynamic principles. To this end, the simple pair-
wise interaction may be generalised into a real system. As has been mentioned
before, all real systems are constructed via the sum of simple pairwise interac-
tions. At the speed of light, the interactions cease, i.e. all motional change in
the system ceases. Because temperature corresponds to microscopic motion,
this would mean that a system has been generated at absolute zero, which is
impossible according to thermodynamic principles. Thus, there is a relation
between light speed and absolute zero temperature.
9.17 In September 2011 the research group OPERA reported a surprising measure-
ment of the speed of so-called neutrinos, a kind of elementary particles which
interact only via weak force and also possibly via gravitation.
The experiment utilized neutrinos that were produced in an accelerator at Cern
in Geneva and travelled below the earth’s surface to a subterranean facility in
central Italy. The distance covered was 731.278km and the journey time, mea-
sured using the satellite-based GPS-system, was determined to be on average
2.43922ms.
a. Determine the average speed of the neutrinos.
b. Compare this to the speed of light in vacuum, 299.792km/s.
c. How does this result compare to the conclusion from the theory of relativity
that nothing can travel faster than light?

This measurement was however declared to be faulty in March 2012. (Other-
wise this chapter had to be rewritten.)

Chapter 10
Field Theory
In fact, whenever energy is transmitted from one body to another
in time, there must be a medium or substance in which the
energy exists after it leaves one body and before it reaches the
other ... and if we admit this medium as an hypothesis, I think it
ought to occupy a prominent place in our investigations, and
that we ought to endeavour to construct a mental representation
of all the details of its action, and this has been my constant aim
in this treatise.
James Clerk Maxwell, 1873
10.1 The Concept of a Field
The notion of an electric and magnetic ﬁeld originates in the issue of conceptually
interpreting action at a distance. By letting a ﬁeld be emitted from one object and
received by the other, the mechanism of the force action was assumed to be clariﬁed.
Such a description of electromagnetic phenomena may have practical advantages
(often apparent) since the complexity of the problem is then divided into two parts
associated with each object respectively. The ﬁeld from one object is ﬁrst calculated
and secondly the force on the other object located in the ﬁeld from the ﬁrst object.
The strength of this procedure appears when the ﬁeld generating object is ﬁxed which
is often the case in technical applications. However, in case of mutual interactions,
i.e. basal physics, the ﬁeld concept is less useful.
Within electromagnetic signal theory, involving for example antennas and wave
guides with belonging transmission and reﬂection effects, the electromagnetic ﬁeld
theory is predominant.
Therefore, in this chapter these ﬁelds will be deﬁned with the aim to formulate
the four equations describing their dynamics, constituting the basis for the science of
electromagnetic engineering. These are called Maxwell’s equations and were devel-
oped by Maxwell and Heaviside during the second half of the nineteenth century.

4πε0R2 ˆR = q2 ¯E1→2
(10.1)
such that
¯E1→2 =
q1
4πε0R2 ˆR
(10.2)
is the electric ﬁeld generated by charge 1 and received by charge 2.
Similarly, a magnetic ﬁeld ¯B from a point charge in motion is deﬁned from the
force formula (2.14), i.e. Grassman’s formula, valid if charge 1 is part of a closed
conductor
¯FG

which is referred to as Biot-Savart’s formula.
From Chap.4 the ﬁeld from different conﬁgurations may be extracted. Formula
(4.6) gives the electric ﬁeld from a long straight charged wire
¯E =
λ
2πε0d ˆρ
(10.5)
where ˆρ is a unit vector perpendicular to the wire.
Formula (4.11) gives the electric ﬁeld from a large charged plate
¯E = σ
2ε0
ˆn
(10.6)
where ˆn is the surface normal of the plate.
The magnetic ﬁeld from a straight current is obtained from formula (4.42)

(10.7)
and that from a large current-carrying plate from formula (4.44b)

10.3 Dipoles
197
10.3 Dipoles
An inspiring experiment is to illustrate the electric and magnetic ﬁeld lines using
macroscopic dipoles, Fig.10.1.
Put some semolina in oil and let it be inﬂuenced by an external charge distribution.
The elongated grains will align with the external electric ﬁeld. Similarly, iron ﬁlings
will align along an external magnetic ﬁeld. The reason is that the external inﬂuence
induces dipoles in the grains and the ﬁlings which experience a torque according to
the description in Chap.7. This will rotate the dipoles until an extreme energy value
is achieved, compare Exercise(7.15). From Chap.7, the torque and the energy for
these processes may be extracted in terms of the ﬁelds. From the deﬁnition of electric
potential, formula (3.3), it is ﬁrst established that
¯E = −∇
(10.9)
so that, using formula (7.2),
Ue = −¯p · ¯E
(10.10)
which accordingly is the energy arising in an interaction between the dipole and the
charged object that generates the electric ﬁeld E, nothing else.
The torque is obtained from formula (7.5)
¯τ = ¯p × ¯E
(10.11)
In the magnetic case, the energy is given by formula (7.33) (or generally by
formula (C5))
Um = ¯m · ¯B
(10.12)
without a minus sign since the magnetic energy is maximized in case of a permanent
dipole m in a constant magnetic ﬁeld.
Fig. 10.1 Left The metallic plates are oppositely charged by a van de Graaf generator. Semolina
in castor oil is sprinkled around. Right Iron ﬁlings are sprinkled around a permanent bar magnet

Field Theory
The torque (7.30) may then be written
¯τ = ¯m × ¯B
(10.13)
These four last formulas describe the discussed experiments.
In addition, the ﬁeld lines generated by a dipole is obtained by comparing formulas
(10.10) and (10.12) to the dipole-dipole interaction energy, formulas (7.16) and
(7.25):
¯Edipole = −

(10.14)
¯Bdipole = −μ0
4π R3 [ ¯m −3( ¯m · ˆR) ˆR]
(10.15)
giving the ﬁeld lines as illustrated in Fig.10.1.
10.4 Material Effects
Material effects were discussed in Chap.8. To describe these phenomena, three vector
quantities are needed: the external inﬂuence, the material response and the total effect
in the material. Table10.1 states how these are represented in ﬁeld theory.
Note that the magnetic ﬁeld B is in this context named magnetic ﬂux density
(sometimes also referred to as magnetic induction). This terminology will become
clear in Sect.10.6.1.
In the electric case, the relation between the ﬁeld vectors is obtained using formula
(8.24):
¯P = −ε0(κe −1)∇ = ¯D −ε0 ¯E
(10.16)
so that the electric displacement vector becomes
¯D = −ε0κe∇ = ε0κe ¯E
(10.17)
where the electric ﬁeld inside the material is
¯E = −∇
(10.18)
In the magnetic case, formula (C6) is utilized to express magnetization

(10.23)
Based on formulas (10.22) and (10.23), materials may be classiﬁed with respect
to properties of the material parameters κe and κm:
• Linear[non-linear] material: material parameters are independent [dependent] on
the strength of the external inﬂuence. The ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials
are examples of non-linear materials, see Exercises(8.15), (8.16) and (10.6).
• Isotropic [anisotropic material]: material parameters are scalars [matrices], see
Exercise(8.12).
• Homogeneous [non-homogeneous material]: the material parameters are coordi-
nate independent [dependent].
Consider now the interaction energy between a material and an external inﬂuence.

10.5 Boundary Conditions
One essential advantage using ﬁeld theory lies in the simpliﬁed usage of so-called
boundary conditions. These deﬁne speciﬁc conditions on the ﬁelds at discontinuities
of the surrounding media giving substantial information on the ﬁelds globally. For
all types of electromagnetic signal transfers, the boundary conditions are decisive.
Applications include wave guides, antennas, ﬁlters and resonance cavities.
Boundary conditions were discussed for the electric case in Sect.8.1.3.1. This is
now extended to general intersections as well as the magnetic case. Firstly it will be
shown that the boundary conditions require knowledge of the divergence and curl of
the ﬁelds. These are then determined for the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds, in total
four formulas.
10.5.1 General Vector Field
Consider ﬁrst a general vector ﬁeld F traversing a discontinuity of the surroundings,
Fig.10.2. The normal component of the discontinuity is directed from medium 1 to 2.
What is the change of the vector’s components parallel (tangential) and perpendicular
(normal) to the discontinuity?

(10.26), we then obtain
( ¯F2 −¯F1) · ˆn = lim
h→0 h∇· ¯F
(10.28)
indicating that the normal component is continuous provided the divergence of the
vector is ﬁnite at the intersection surface.
2. Tangential component ¯Ft⊥ˆn
Form a small rectangle C around the discontinuity, Fig.10.4. Stokes’ theorem is now
utilized to gain information at the discontinuity

obtain
ˆt · ( ¯F2 −¯F1)s + contribution from verticals = ∇× ¯F · ˆn′hs
(10.30)
Let h →0 so that the contribution from the vertical sides vanishes:
ˆt · ( ¯F2 −¯F1)s = ∇× ¯F · ˆn′hs
(10.31)
Since ˆt = ˆn′ × ˆn
(ˆn′ × ˆn) · ( ¯F2 −¯F1)s = ∇× ¯F · ˆn′hs
(10.32)
which may be written
ˆn′ · (ˆn × ( ¯F2 −¯F1))s = ∇× ¯F · ˆn′hs
(10.33)
giving
ˆn × ( ¯F2 −¯F1) = lim
h→0 h∇× ¯F
(10.34)
which may also be expressed directly in terms of tangential components (show this)
¯F2t −¯F1t = lim
h→0 h[∇× ¯F × ˆn]
(10.35)
indicating that the tangential component of a vector ﬁeld is continuous at a discon-
tinuity provided its curl is ﬁnite at the intersection surface.
Formulas (10.28) and (10.35) show that the electromagnetic boundary conditions
are deﬁned by the divergence and curl of the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds. This is
the main motivation for introducing Maxwell-Heaviside’s ﬁeld equations.

10.5.2 Divergence and Curl for Static Electric
and Magnetic Fields
The boundary conditions are now to be speciﬁed for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
by determining their divergence and curl. Consider ﬁrst the static (time independent)
case. The time varying case will be treated in Sect.10.6. Primed coordinates are used
for the position of the source elements, ¯r′ = (x′, y′, z′), and unprimed coordinates
for the position of the ﬁeld, ¯r = (x, y, z), Fig.10.5.1
The electric ﬁeld is given by formula (10.2) and may be expressed as
¯E(¯r) =
1
4πε0

V ′
ρ(¯r′)
R2
ˆRdV′
(10.36)
where ¯R = ¯r −¯r′ and ρ is the charge density.
For the divergence of E, ∇· ¯E, ∇acts on the unprimed coordinate so that
∇·

R2 = ∇·

R3 + 1
R3 ∇· ¯R = 0 for


V ′ ∇·

R2 dV′ vanishes everywhere apart from a point at ¯R = 0 where it is 4π, the
divergence of E may be written
∇· ¯E(¯r) = 1

ρ(¯r′)δ(¯r −¯r′)dV′
(10.37)
where the delta function is deﬁned as

V ′
f (¯r′)δ(¯r −¯r′)dV′ = 0 if ¯r outside the volume V ′

V ′
f (¯r′)δ(¯r −¯r′)dV′ = f (¯r) if ¯r inside the volume V ′
(10.38)
It is then obtained
∇· ¯E(¯r) = ρ(¯r)
ε0
(10.39)
Hence, the divergence of the electric ﬁeld is non-vanishing only at a point where
charge exists.

10.5.3 Boundary Conditions for Static Electric
and Magnetic Fields
The boundary conditions for a general vector ﬁeld, obtained in Sect.10.5.1, are now
speciﬁed for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in case of static conditions. The results
from Sects.10.5.1 and 10.5.2 are ﬁrst compiled in Table10.2:

h→0 h ρ

(10.53)
Referring to Fig.10.3 it is understood that Q = haρ is the total charge contained
in the cylinder. When h →0 this may be written Q = aσ where σ is charge per
unit surface. Therefore

¯J is current density, i.e. current per area. Referring to Fig.10.4, the total current
through the rectangle’s area becomes I = ¯J · hs ˆn′ so that
¯B2t −¯B1t = μ0 ¯K × ˆn
(10.58)
where ¯K = I/s ˆn′, i.e. current per length unit. The current is parallel to the surface
normal of the rectangle.
10.6 Maxwell’s Equations
The four equations deﬁning the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic ﬁelds
are called Maxwell’s equations and given in the static case by Table10.2:
∇· ¯E(¯r) = ρ(¯r)

(10.59)
∇· ¯B(¯r) = 0
(10.60)
∇× ¯E(¯r) = 0

(10.62)
However, there are known electromagnetic phenomena not included in the formu-
las above. These are Faraday-Henry’s induction effect, formulas (3.33) and (3.34),
and the continuity equation for electric charge, formula (5.20). These include the
time variation of the ﬁelds.
10.6.1 Accelerating Charges—The Time Variation
of the Magnetic Field
Induction effects occur for time varying current, i.e. accelerating charges correspond-
ing to time varying magnetic ﬁeld. The underlying force on charges in acceleration
is the Weber formula (3.34)

where ¯R = ¯r2 −¯r1. The right-hand side may be expressed in terms of the magnetic

where a minus sign has been introduced on the right-hand side by the following
reason. By combining (10.69) and (10.70) including the minus sign from (10.71a)
the voltage becomes

rent change in accordance with observation. This effect is known as Lenz’s law,
see Exercise(3.5). Note that the direction of current is deﬁned to be parallel to the
electric ﬁeld.
10.6.2 The Continuity Equation—Time Variation
of Electric Field
The continuity equation for electric charge, formula (5.20)
∇· ¯J + dρ
dt = 0
(10.72)
constitutes implicit information on the dynamics of free charges based on the hypoth-
esis that electric charge is conserved. The equation deals with charges in motion and
accordingly a time varying electric ﬁeld. This effect may be included in the ﬁeld
static formula (10.62) by considering the divergence of current
∇· ¯J = 1
μ0
∇· ∇× ¯B = 0
(10.73)
For a time varying electric ﬁeld, (10.73) becomes using (10.72)

μ0
∇· ∇× ¯B

(10.77)
This may be interpreted that the sources to the magnetic ﬁeld are both an electric
current and a time varying electric ﬁeld.

10.7 Potentials
The mathematical structure of Maxwell’s equations allows for an introduction of
so-called potentials by which the ﬁelds may be expressed. The purpose of this pro-
cedure is to simplify the computational technique.
Consider ﬁrst the ﬁeld static case. Since ∇× ¯E(¯r) = 0 and the curl of a gradient
vanishes, the electric ﬁeld may be expressed by a scalar potential :
¯E = −∇
(10.78)
which is formula (10.9).
In the magnetic case, since ∇· ¯B(¯r) = 0 and the divergence of a curl vanishes,
the magnetic ﬁeld may be expressed as
¯B = ∇× ¯A
(10.79)
where A is called the magnetic vector potential. Using formula (10.66), the vector
potential is
¯A = I μ0
4π

C
d ¯L
R
(10.80)
For time varying ﬁelds, the electric ﬁeld is modiﬁed according to Faraday-Henry’s
induction law (10.71a)
∇× ¯E(¯r, t) = −d
dt ∇× ¯A(¯r, t)
(10.81)
so that
¯E(¯r, t) = −∇(¯r, t) −d ¯A(¯r, t)
dt
(10.82)
Since
∇· ¯B(¯r, t) = 0
(10.83)
also for time varying ﬁelds, formula (10.79) is unaltered
¯B(¯r, t) = ∇× ¯A(¯r, t)
(10.84)
10.8 Power Transportation—The Poynting Vector
The power evaluated in an electrodynamic system may be expressed exclusively in
terms of ﬁelds. The stored energy of a system changes by reasons of heat generation
and energy transportation in or out of the system. It is the objective here to express

10.8 Power Transportation—The Poynting Vector
211
these energy forms in terms of ﬁelds in order to identify the power transportation
in/out of the volume. This is of crucial importance when dealing with signal transfer
between electrodynamic systems such as antennas.
The analysis starts from the expression of heat power, i.e. Joule’s law (5.15).
Using the principle of energy conservation, heat power equals the change of stored
energy minus the power transported out from the system. Consider a volume V . The
heat power density is
Pfr
V = J 2
σ
(10.85)
where J is the current density in the volume and σ is the conductivity. The index fr
stands for friction, the origin of heat power. According to Exercise5.7, Ohm’s law
may be written
¯J = σ ¯E
(10.86)
where E is the electric ﬁeld generating the current J. Since the current is generated
in the direction of the electric ﬁeld, the heat power density may be written as a scalar
product
Pfr
V = ¯J · ¯E
(10.87)
The heat power becomes
Pfr =

V
¯J · ¯EdV
(10.88)
which is now to be expressed in terms of ﬁelds only. Using Maxwell’s equation
(10.77) together with (10.22) and (10.23), current density becomes
¯J = ∇× ¯H −d ¯D
dt
(10.89)
so that heat power may be written

dt −∇· ( ¯E × ¯H) (10.91)
where the Faraday-Henry induction law (10.71a) has been used in the last equality.

hand side is therefore the power transported in or out of the volume. The integrand
of this term is called the Poynting vector
¯S = ¯E × ¯H
(10.94)
corresponding to the power transported per unit area. In Chap.11 the Poynting vector
will be applied to ﬁnd the power transmitted by an antenna.

Antenna Theory—The Loop and the Dipole
It was shortly after midday on December 12, 1901, [in a hut on the
cliffs at St. John’s, Newfoundland] that I placed a single earphone
to my ear and started listening. The receiver on the table before
me was very crude - a few coils and condensers and a coherer -
no valves [vacuum tubes], no ampliﬁers, not even a crystal. I was
at last on the point of putting the correctness of all my beliefs to
test. … [The] answer came at 12:30. … Suddenly, about half past
twelve there sounded the sharp click of the ‘tapper’ … Unmistak-
ably, the three sharp clicks corresponding to three dots sounded
in my ear. ‘Can you hear anything, Mr. Kemp?’ I asked, handing
the telephone to my assistant. Kemp heard the same thing as I. …
I knew then that I had been absolutely right in my calculations.
The electric waves which were being sent out from Poldhu [Corn-
wall, England] had travelled the Atlantic, serenely ignoring the
curvature of the earth which so many doubters considered a fatal
obstacle. … I knew that the day on which I should be able to send
full messages without wires or cables across the Atlantic was not
far distant.

In Chap.9 it was shown that the magnetic and inductive forces may be interpreted as
motional consequences of the electric force, an interpretation based on the fact that
interactions take time, Figs.9.1 and 9.2.
Figure9.2 shows that charge 2 receives the momentum at t = t2, emitted by
charge 1 at time t1. These times are related according to
t1 = t2 −R∗
c
(11.1)
where time t1 is called ‘retarded time’. In e.g. Exercise (2.19), the retardation effect
was not considered since the distance is small and the two times t1 and t2 are almost
equal. To describe a general interaction the retardation effects must be considered.
In this chapter, two basic examples will be analysed showing the importance of
retardation. These are the loop and dipole antennas, corresponding to a closed circular

and a straight (non-closed) conductor respectively, both fed by an AC voltage and
assumed to be small so that the current is uniform. The principles of an antenna array
are then discussed by analysing a two-element system.
In the exercise section it is shown that antenna theory is also applicable to natural
processes. By modelling matter as vibrating dipoles, equivalent to the dipole antenna,
the reﬂection and refraction laws may be derived and thoroughly understood. In
particular, the interesting phenomenon called Brewster reﬂection is clariﬁed.
11.1 The Loop Antenna
Consider a closed circular current-carrying conductor interacting with a point-like
charge q at rest and at a large distance from the loop, Fig.11.1.
From the electrodynamical force formula (3.35) it is ﬁrst noted that an interaction
occurs only through the inductive force, i.e. the acceleration dependent Weber force
(3.34). For an interaction at a distance R,

Consider now the circular loop, Fig.11.1. By symmetry reasons, the total force is
directed along the spherical coordinate φ of the point charge q. Let it be located at
y = 0, i.e. on the x axis in the xy plane as in Fig.11.1. The length element dL′
contributes to the inﬁnitesimal φ component of the force as
dFφ = −jωqadφ′ cos φ′
4πε0c2r′
I0e jωte−jωr′/c
(11.7)
where dL′ = adφ′.
Consider two diametrically opposite length elements of the loop. These will con-
tribute to the force in opposite directions but due to their different distance to the
charge q, a net effect will appear:
dFφ = −jωqadφ′ cos φ′
4πε0c2
I0e jωt[e−jωr′/c

−e−jωr′′/c

(11.8)
Using the cosine theorem, the distances are given by
r′2 = a2 + r2 −2ar sin θ cos φ′
r′′2 = a2 + r2 + 2ar sin θ cos φ′
where the last two terms have different signs since the elements are diametrically
opposite and the angle φ′ refers to the primed element.
Since r ≫a, these distances may be Taylor expanded. Keeping terms up to the
order a/r gives
r′ ≈r(1 −a

be small so that the current is uniform, i.e. it does not vary along the loop:

The ﬁrst term, varying as 1/r, is predominant at large distance and is known as
‘radio waves’. In the direction along the loop axis there is no force on the resting
charge q.
11.2 The Dipole Antenna
The dipole antenna consists of a straight AC fed wire. The feed gap will here be
neglected, Fig.11.2.
For this antenna there is in addition to the Weber force an electric force, the reason
being that charges accumulate at the ends of the wire, motivating its name. The forces
will be treated separately, starting with the electric interaction.

The sinus theorem gives

so that up to order l/r

The ﬁrst term in (11.31) predominates the total force in the far distance from the
source, commonly known as ‘radio waves’. In this case there is no interaction along
the wire, θ = 0, compare Exercise (11.6).
11.3 Antenna Array
An array of antenna elements may be used to create a focused directed force action.
Consider a two-element array of two small (point-like) dipole antennas, Fig.11.4.
The dipoles are now oriented along the x axis. To simplify, consider the interaction
in the xz plane only so that sin θ in formula (11.31) is just replaced by cos θ. In the
far distance the total force becomes

Formula (11.34) is valid in the far distance. It also assumes that the antennas oscillate
in phase. The force action may be focused in different directions by introducing a
phase shift β between the element oscillations. The force then becomes:

11.4 Power Transmission
The antenna power transmission will now be formulated using the Poynting vector
(10.94). In ﬁeld theory the force acting on a point charge at rest is due to an electric
ﬁeld. Both the electrostatic and inductive forces are therefore associated with an
electric ﬁeld, obtained by dividing the force formulas by q, see Exercise (11.11).

230
11
Antenna Theory—The Loop and the Dipole
The power transmitted per unit area is
¯S = ¯E × ¯H
(11.36)
where the magnetic ﬁeld intensity H in the far distance is generated solely by the
electric ﬁeld E and vice versa.
Since the time variation is usually quicker than what can be measured, the time
averaged power is considered. As is shown in Exercise (11.12), when working with
complex quantities varying harmonically with time (so-called phasors), the time
average of the real Poynting vector is

The magnetic ﬁeld is given by Maxwell’s equation (10.71), the induction law

(11.38)
The time dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld is the same as that for the electric ﬁeld
so that
∇× ¯E = −jω ¯B
(11.39)
11.4.1 The Dipole Antenna
Consider ﬁrst the small dipole antenna with uniform current. Far away from the
source, the so-called far ﬁeld, the electric ﬁeld is obtained from (11.31):
Eθ ≈Ie−jωr/cl sin θ

themselves are perpendicular to each other.

Antenna Theory—The Loop and the Dipole
11.5 The Wave Concept
The basic antenna theory outlined above is actually a wave theory. A wave is a
concept deﬁned by the following three criteria:
• A wave causes a periodic disturbance in space and time propagating at a ﬁnite speed
• A wave exhibits interference effects
• An undisturbed wave has an inﬁnite range
In antenna theory item 1 is true by virtue of the resulting formulas (11.11) and (11.31)
which shows periodic disturbances in both space and time.
Item2isprovedinExercise(11.2)whereformula(11.34)isappliedtoﬁndmaxima
and minima in the force pattern.
Item 3 demands a distance dependence as 1/r, i.e. the far ﬁeld terms of the
formulas. The reason is that the power through a closed sphere is then distance
independent. Integrating for example formula (11.43) around a spherical shell of
radius r, the power becomes
⟨P⟩= const ·
 2π
0
 π
0
sin2 θ(1
r )2r2 sin θdθdφ
independent of distance. The far ﬁeld approximation is accordingly equivalent to a
wave propagation.
An important approximation in wave theory is the concept of a ‘plane wave’. This
corresponds to a wave with an extended wave front propagating in one particular
direction. This may be achieved in two ways:
1. Far away from an oscillating point source where the circular wave fronts are
approximately straight over an extended distance.
2. Close to a straight row of pointlike oscillators, i.e. an antenna array.

In the far distance from the source, the force is perpendicular to the lines
of interaction, see formulas (11.11) and (11.31). Accordingly, there are two
possible directions of the force.
Consider an interaction between an antenna and a material as in Exercise
(11.5). The two possible direction of force is divided into a direction perpen-
dicular to surface normal, i.e. out of the plane in the ﬁgure, and a direction
in the plane of the ﬁgure. The latter case involves a phenomenon known as
‘Brewster reﬂection’. At a certain incident angle the reﬂection vanishes.

*11.7 Spider vision
Many species of spider have evolved a vision sense that is sensitive to the
directionofforcefromasource,so-calledpolarisationvision.Oftheirusually
four pair of eyes, one pair is used for this purpose. The two eyes are struc-
tured such that they are sensitive to direction of force in relative perpendicular
directions. The spider uses this sense to orient and navigate during dawn and
morning when the sun is too close to the horizon to be visible for the spider.
β
Reflection surface
In this case the sun is the source antenna and the spider looks towards heaven.
Determine the angle β in the ﬁgure for which the spider experiences only
one direction of force. This will be the spot on heaven most usable for
navigation aid (Fig.11.5).

*11.8 Refractive index and speed of light
Snell’s refraction law is frequently expressed with the so-called refractive
index n, a material quantity deﬁned by writing the refraction law in the
following way:
n1 sin α1 = n2 sin α2
where index 1 refers to the incident material and index 2 to the transmit-
ted material. The refractive index is given in relation to ‘vacuum’ such that
nvacuum = 1 exactly.
Find an expression for the refractive index in terms of the material parame-
ters dielectric constant κe and relative magnetic permeability κm.
11.9 Refractive index for water is around 1.6 whereas the dielectric constant is
around 80 in the electrostatic case. Since κm ≈1 for water there seem to be
an inconsistency. Could you explain this?
11.10 Metamaterials
Metamaterials are characterized as having a negative refractive index mean-
ing that the angle γ in Exercise (11.5) is negative.
Prove that this violates the principle of cause and effect.
What is the angle of re-radiation for a meta-material?
*11.11 Using formulas (10.80) and (10.82) show that the Weber inductive force is
associated with an electric ﬁeld in ﬁeld theory.

Show that the time average of the Poynting vector is given by formula
(11.37).

of two parallel small dipole antennas.

Appendix A
Electric Multipoles
In Sects.7.1.4 and 8.3, the general multipole expansion was discussed. In Exercise
(7.1), a multipole expansion of the electrostatic potential is performed. In this and the
next appendix, the expansion will be obtained from a general interaction picture in
the electric and the magnetic case respectively. The starting point is the basic energy
formulas (8.89) and (8.88).
The electric energy is given by (8.89), Fig.A.1,
Ue =


V

V ′
ρ(¯r)ρ′(¯r′)
R

(A.1)
where ¯R = ¯r −¯r′. If the systems interact at a large distance, the energy may be
expressed through the multipole expansion. The energy is then series-expanded (also
known as Taylor or Maclaurin expansion) with respect to the distance between the
systems.
In the ﬁrst step, let the system V ′ interact with a pointlike system V with the
position vector ¯r, where r ≫r′, and expand the energy arisen about the centre of
V ′. This means that the system V ′ is expressed in multipole terms. The second step
involves a series expansion about the centre of the system V , for each multipole order
of V ′, thereby expressing the system V in terms of multipoles.
The calculation will be made up to the order 1/d5 corresponding to a quadrupole–
quadrupole interaction, where d is the distance between the centres of the systems.
The following deﬁnitions will be used:

formula (A.4) is chosen as this deﬁnition is simpler and results in more transparent
formulas.

Now consider the next term in the V ′-structure, formula (A.5), corresponding to a

centre of the unprimed system. The integrand of the second term in formula (A.5)
becomes

A.2.3 V ′ Quadrupole
Quadrupole-monopole and quadrupole-dipole were calculated above but with
reversed systems. The energy is of course independent of which system is primed or
unprimed. Therefore, there is only one remaining interaction at this level:
Quadrupole–quadrupole

In the ﬁrst step, let the system V ′ interact with a pointlike system V with the
position vector r, where r ≫r′, and expand the arisen energy about the centre of V ′.
This means that the system V ′ is expressed in terms of multipoles. Secondly, series-
expand for each multipole order of V ′ about the centre of the system V , thereby
expressing the system V in multipoles (equivalent to Appendix A).

which should be expressed in terms of dipole moment, formula (B.2).

The ﬁrst term in formula (B.8) is expanded in the following manner:
According to vector algebra
( ¯J · ¯J ′)(¯x · ¯r′) = ( ¯J × ¯x) · ( ¯J ′ × ¯r′) + ( ¯J · ¯r′)( ¯J ′ · ¯x)
(B.9)

The second term of formula (B.8) is evaluated in the following manner:

it is also valid that

since the factor ( ¯d · ¯x) is also treated as a constant during the calculation, which is
made via the primed coordinate. The right-hand side may be rewritten
( ¯J · ¯J ′)( ¯d · ¯r′)( ¯d · ¯x) ⇔1
2( ¯J × ¯d) · ( ¯J ′ × ¯r′)( ¯d · ¯x)
= 1
2( ¯J × ¯d) · ¯x( ¯J ′ × ¯r′) · ¯d + 1
2( ¯J × ¯d) × ¯d · ( ¯J ′ × ¯r′) × ¯x
(B.15)
where the equivalence signs indicate that the relationship is valid after integration
over the volume V ′. This notation is used in the following.
Consider the second term of the right-hand side
( ¯J × ¯d) × ¯d · ( ¯J ′ × ¯r′) × ¯x = ( ¯d · ( ¯J · ¯d) −¯Jd2)(¯r′( ¯J ′ · ¯x) −¯J ′(¯r′ · ¯x))
= ( ¯d · ¯r′)( ¯J · ¯d)( ¯J ′ · ¯x) −( ¯d · ¯J ′)( ¯J · ¯d)(¯r′ · ¯x)
−( ¯J · ¯r′)( ¯J ′ · ¯x)d2 + ( ¯J · ¯J ′)(¯r′ · ¯x)d2
= ( ¯d · ¯r′)( ¯J · ¯d)( ¯J ′ · ¯x) −( ¯d · ¯J ′)( ¯J · ¯d)(¯r′ · ¯x)
+ d2( ¯J × ¯x) · ( ¯J ′ × ¯r′)
(B.16)
The following relations will now be used,
∇′ · ( ¯d · ¯r′)(¯x · ¯r′) ¯J ′ = ( ¯d · ¯J ′)(¯x · ¯r′) + ( ¯d · ¯r′)( ¯J ′ · ¯x) ⇔0
(B.17)

= ( ¯d · ¯J)( ¯d · ¯r′)( ¯J ′ · ¯x) + ( ¯d · ¯x)( ¯d · ¯r′)( ¯J ′ · ¯J) ⇔0
(B.18)
Formula (B.16) then becomes

Pierre-Simon Laplace 1749–1827
D.1 Basic Principles
1.1 a. A force appears as a minimization of the gravitational energy U. The work
W done by the gravitational force is
dW = ¯F · d ¯s = −dU
so that a decrease of energy U gives a positive work meaning that the force is
parallel to the displacement ds. Thus, the energy principle gives the direction
of the force.
b. If R denotes distance between a falling object with mass m and the center of
the earth, the force becomes
¯F = −∇U = −d
d R mgR ˆR = −mg ˆR
where the distance vector is directed towards the object for which the force
is calculated and g is the gravitational acceleration. The forces on the objects
have accordingly the same magnitude but opposite direction.
c. The concept ‘free fall’ implies neglect of air resistance. The energy forms are
then the stored gravitation appearing in the interaction between the objects
and kinetic energy of both objects.
d. The kinetic energy of the earth may be neglected since its mass is so large.
As a consequence, one object in the mutual interaction appears as being ﬁxed
which is fundamentally wrong.
1.2 a. Provided the altitude is high enough, the air resistance results in a higher ter-
minal speed for the heavier object. The reason is that air resistance increases

with speed, implying that its balance with the gravitational force occurs at a
higher speed for the heavier object.
b. The moon has negligible atmosphere so that the principle of equal falling
times for objects with different masses may be tested and veriﬁed.
This phenomenon is closer analysed in Exercise (5.6).
1.3 a. Gravitational mass is the source of gravitational force. The acceleration
caused by the force is inversely proportional to inertial mass. The observation
of falling times for objects with different masses is one of many possibilities
to investigate the relation between gravitational and inertial mass. To a very
high degree of accuracy they have been found to be equal.
b. Mach’s principle is a hypothesis on the origin of inertial mass. It says that the
equality between gravitational and inertial mass is due to the fact that inertia
is generated by gravitation. It explains that when an object is accelerated,
the rest of the mass in the universe will interact with it so as to oppose the
acceleration, i.e. an inertial effect appears.
See also Exercises (2.23) and (9.15).
1.4 a. At this position the only relevant gravitation is that from the earth. The force is
F = G m1m2
R2
= 6.67 × 10−11
5.98 × 1024 × 100
(6.38 × 106 + 4.00 × 105)2 N
= 3988 × 1013
(6.78 × 106)2 N = 868 N
Hence, the word ‘weightless’ is misleading. The ﬂoating state the person
experiences is due to being in a free fall where the gravitational force acts
alone. Thus, the electromagnetic forces, so-called normal forces, are absent.
b. The change of weight would be 31mg which is easily measurable with a
modern precision balance.
1.5 These occur due to the motion of the observer and are not caused by any natural
dynamics. A coriolis effect occurs for example because of the rotation of the
earth affecting direction of winds and water ﬂow. A centrifugal effect occurs
in curved motion, e.g. in a merry-go-round. Through the active force directed
towards the circular center, an inertia is generated known as the centrifugal effect.
1.6 All motion must be related to something. There is no absolute motion.

per meter equal to μ0/2π.
*2.6 a. v is the relative velocity between the observer and the charges.
b. Same as in Fig.2.10 where the charges are in motion.
c. The viewer observes in the horizontal direction the motional change, i.e.
the acceleration of the two objects, nothing else.
d. Either that the force is less or that the mass is greater or that time is running
slower or all these possibilities as in Einstein’s theory of relativity.
2.7 a. Use formula (2.6)

2πx I2dL2 ˆx = −μ0I1
2πx q2v2 ˆx
where I1 = nqvd A and mev2
2/2 = q
b. Utilize an ordinary electron tube and a current-carrying straight conductor.
The force may be measured by for example letting the electron beam pass
through two plates connected to a variable voltage source. The voltage
between the plates is adjusted so that the electric force balances the mag-
netic force. The electric force may then be obtained according to Sect.4.1.

free charges.

Hence, in a microwave oven the water molecules oscillate perpendicular
to their own axes which in turn affects the surroundings such that heat is
generated.
In general one must here also consider distance effects as well as the fact that
the straight conductor is also an oscillating dipole since charge is accumu-
lated at its ends, see Chap.11.
2.20 Since the right leg is closer to the beam, the inductive force will be larger on
this one than on the left leg. Hence, the electrons are driven clockwise, i.e.
the current direction becomes anti-clockwise. The inductive force acts also
on the horizontal sides but will here not contribute to the current.

into the plane
First case from left: the inductive force will be largest on the upper side since
it is closest to the beam.
Second case: there is no induction current since the inductive force on the two
horizontal sides cancel each other.
Third case: equivalent to the ﬁrst case.
Fourth case: There is no force in the plane of the loop and thus no induction
current.
These experiments are simple to perform since an ordinary straight conductor
current may be used as the electron beam.
2.22 a. Consider the electron in the ﬁgure. Its net acceleration is clockwise along
the tangent of the loop. The inductive force between two electrons is a
response oppositely directed the acceleration of the affecting object. The

horizontal inductive forces cancel. The net inductive force will be directed
upwards since the electrons closest to the considered electron accelerate
downwards.

The inductive force acts accordingly as a resistance to the acceleration
caused by the battery.
b. In the straight conductor, the acceleration on the electrons is everywhere
the same. The inductive force is oppositely directed to this direction and
accordingly acts a resistance to the battery acceleration.
c. The inductive force, as all kind of force, occurs in interactions.
2.23 It might be fruitful to consider this phenomena already at this stage. However,
this issue will be returned to in Chap.9, Exercise (9.15).

The ﬁrst and third term vanish and a force in the direction of ¯v1 occurs.
On the other hand, if ¯v2 is oppositely directed, a force opposite to ¯v1
occurs, i.e. a current is induced in loop 2 oppositely directed to the cur-
rent in loop 1.
d. The same result occurs as in Exercise c since the relative motion is the
same.
e. The relativity principle of Galilei means that motion is relative; it has to be
related to some other motion. Einstein applied this principle as the basis
for the special theory of relativity. He extended the principle, showing its
validity also for electromagnetic phenomena as this example indicates.
However, instead of the battery connected loop, Einstein preferred a per-

The interaction between the point charge and the cylindrical shell is ﬁrst
explored after which the work is calculated with methods developed in
Sect.4.1.5.
Consider a thin shell in cross-section as in the ﬁgure below. The force on a
point charge located on the x axis should be determined. By symmetry it is
noted that the force is directed radially from the shell, i.e. along the x axis in
this case.

Denote with σ the surface charge density of the shell. Since charge per length

This is now to be integrated over the full circle. The integral may be found in a
handbook (e.g. Mathematical Handbook 15.49 1st ed.) and the result depends
on whether r is greater or less than r′, i.e. if the point charge is placed inside

Thus, inside the shell no force occurs on the point charge while outside the

cylinder. Compare this result with that of a sphere, Sect.4.1.4.

3 in formula (2.11). The conductor sides perpendicular to the straight con-
ductor don’t contribute to the force. The distal parallel sides may be placed
far away to give negligible contribution. Thus, the two long parallel con-
ductors of equal length is in this respect equivalent to a closed conductor,
as was pointed out in Exercise (2.10).

b. The interaction energy becomes

l μ0I2πa2I1 = N
l μ0I2m
where m = I1πa2 is called the dipole moment of the loop, which will be
discussed in more detail in Chap.7.
c. In Exercise a, the case when the surface normal of the loop is parallel to the
axis of the coil was treated. How is the mutual inductance affected if the
surface normal forms an angle θ to the coil axis? The coil axis is chosen
as the z axis and the direction of the loop is taken into account by forming
a vector of the dipole moment:
¯m = I1πa2 ˆn
where ˆn is the direction of the loop’s surface normal. According to the basic
deﬁnition of inductance, formula (3.30), it is concluded that the scalar prod-
uct between the inﬁnitesimal elements results in an additional factor which
is cos θ, independent of the object’s position so that
d ¯L1 · d ¯L2 = ab cos(φ2 −φ1) cos θdφ1dφ2
Since cos θ is a constant, nothing is changed in the calculation apart from
this factor so that energy becomes
Um = nμ0I2m cos θ = N
l μ0I2 ¯m · ˆz

286

d. The force vanishes since the energy is independent of translational coordi-
nates. However, a torque occurs as
τ = dUm
dθ
= −N
l μ0I2m sin θ
which turns the loop until the angle is 0 or π.
Stable equilibrium occurs for θ = 0. For θ = π the currents of the loop and the
coil are oppositely directed resulting in a repulsive force. As a consequence,
unstable equilibrium is attained since the slightest disturbance will turn the
loop. On the other hand, for θ = 0, a disturbance will be counteracted since
the currents then attract.
Note that the magnetic energy is maximized.

b. The force between single loops are usually small and hard to measure. If
instead short coils are used, the current is multiplied by a factor N, the num-
ber of turns. Since the current appears quadratically the force is magniﬁed
with the product of number of turns from each coil. Two identical coils
with 100 turns each will then give a force magniﬁcation of a factor 10,000.
However, the force formula must then be corrected since the different loops
interact at different positions, see ﬁgure.

These three properties of the metal originate from the practically free conduc-
tion electrons. These are responsible for making the metal an equally good
heat conductor as current carrier.
In addition, due to the conduction electrons the metal is shiny and, if well-
polished, works as a mirror. To understand the mirror, one has to take into
account the vision sense in the discussion. When something is registered by
the vision, it basically means that an electric interaction has caused an action
potential in the eye. Usually, the eye interacts with the electric dipole vibrations
of the objects, e.g. a ﬂower. Including the mirror in the dynamics a three objects
dynamics arise. Firstly, the dipole vibrations is picked up by the mirror whose
conduction electrons manage to exactly reproduce the charge vibration pattern
of the ﬂower. When the eye is directed towards the mirror, it interacts with the
vibrating conduction electrons and registers an image identical to the real
object.
The mirror is certainly a miracle and reveals in this way some of the basic
mysteries of nature.
A mirror image may also be produced by water and glass surfaces, although
these do not contain any conduction electrons. In these cases it is their mobile
electric dipoles that mimic the charge vibration of the object.

where the energy is given by (7.36)
U = μ0
I1
2Y I2 Aˆn2 · ˆy = μ0
I1
2Y I2 A cos θ
for this speciﬁc case where θ is the angle between the y axis and the surface
normal of the loop.
The direction of the torque is obtained by considering the magnetic forces
on the sides of the loop. Since parallel currents attract, the torque will act
such as the surface normal becomes parallel to the y axis, i.e. the torque
is directed along negative z:
¯τ = −μ0
I1
2Y I2 A sin θ ˆz
2. Alternatively, formula (7.30) may be used:

308
Appendix D: Solutions to Exercises
¯τ = μ0
2 ¯m × ( ¯K × ˆn) = −μ0
2 mK sin θ ˆz
The force on the loop is given by formula (7.28):
d ¯F = Id ¯L × ˆy μ0K
2
so that the forces on parallel sides are equal in magnitude but oppositely
directed so that the total force vanishes. Alternatively, the force may be
obtained by taking the gradient of the energy determined above. The same
result is obtained since the energy is independent of position, depending
only on orientation.
7.10 The problem with the system discussed in the previous exercise and in
Sect.7.2.2 is that the large plate is not realizable. A similar system made
up of a closed circuit has to replace the large plate. One possibility is to put
together four small plates with a square cross section and with the loop placed
inside, illustrated in the ﬁgure.

Appendix D: Solutions to Exercises

Since ¯K × ˆn is equal for all plates the contribution to torque and induc-
tion voltage is equal from all plates. In this way, a motor and a generator
respectively may be realized.
Note that when the loop is oriented as in the ﬁgure no torque appears.

Figure 2.13 shows an example of a generator or motor construction.

moment of the loop varies equivalently in the two cases.

dt (I1M12)
and
I1M12 = μ0 ¯A · ( ¯K × ˆn)

since the surface normal in this case is perpendicular to the y axis. The
time derivative vanishes and no voltage is induced.
7.12 Using the notation as in Exercises (7.8–7.11), the energy for an interaction
between a current loop and a large current-carrying plate is
Up = μ0K
2
¯m · ˆy
The interaction energy between a current loop and a current-carrying ideal
coil, with the loop placed inside the coil, is given by formula (4.89 in Exercise
4.13)
Uc = μ0nIcˆz · ¯m
where n is the density of turns for the coil, Ic the current in its conductor and
z its axis. The total current of the coil is N Ic so that its linear current density
is Kc = N Ic/l, where l is the length of the coil (along its axis) and N is the
number of turns. The energy becomes
Uc = μ0Kcˆz · ¯m
so in the latter case the energy is twice that of the former case if current density
is equal. Therefore, the same energy appears if two large plates interact with
the loop.

The smallest possible distance between the objects is 2a and at this distance
a speed greater than light speed is needed in order to reach balance. This
speed is not possible to reach, see Chap.9.

(2.17):

The two magnetic forces are both attractive while the electric force is
repulsive. It follows that at balance the translational speed v is given by
v2 = c2 −

of the sphere vmax so that vmax = ωa:

Putting the maximal rotational speed to c, we note that the rotation has
very little affect on the translational speed v at balance. Hence, the self

312
Appendix D: Solutions to Exercises
rotation contributes far less to the magnetic force than the translational
motion.
Nevertheless, the self rotation makes it possible to reach balance theo-
retically since then the speed need not be exactly c. This is interesting
philosophically since at this speed the interactions cease and time stands
still. See Chap.9.
e. As is further discussed in Chap.9, magnetism is a motional consequence
arising since interactions take time. As such, similar effects ought to appear
in case of gravitation, which is also included in the theory of general
relativity (so-called ‘Lense-Thirring frame dragging’). Hence, a rotating
vehicle should, if the result from Exercise d is taken over to gravitation,
reduce the gravitational force. However, the effect is much too small to
neutralize the force.

a displacement of the conduction electrons in the iron occurs, caused by
the rotation of the earth. This rotation also causes the displaced charges to
move in circles and thereby give rise to geomagnetism. This model of the
geomagnetism is the conventional one and is called the dynamo model.

Exercise (2.5). Sources of error concern mainly the calibration of the wire,
i.e. the determination of the torsional constant.
Using balances of different kinds, the force may be determined vertically by
comparing with the object’s weight. The calibration is also in this case the
main error source. Using a spring balance the calibration aims at determin-
ing the spring constant. Other types of balances are calibrated using e.g. a
reference weight which in turn has to be determined somehow.

trons are described by closed orbits around the atomic nucleus, so-called
orbital motion, and rotation around its own axis, so-called spin. In addi-
tion to these motional types, the conduction electrons exhibit an almost
free motion which is affected by the slightest inﬂuence.
c. Orbital motion and spin shall be considered as closed and with main-
tained current, equivalent to a current loop driven by a battery. When
interacting with an external inﬂuence, magnetic energy should then be
maximized. Therefore, the dipoles of the material align parallel to the
dipole moment of the external inﬂuence and an attractive force occur.
Compare formula (7.25).

The third type of motion, the free motion of conduction electrons, is not
maintainedbutisapureinductiveeffect.BasicallyitiscausedbyWeber’s
acceleration dependent force, formula (2.22), however mostly discussed
intermsofFaraday-Henry’sinductionlaw(3.33).Thus,whenanexternal
inﬂuence with constant current approaches the material, the material
responds with an oppositely directed current and the two objects repel.
d. Iftheresistancevanishes,theconductionelectronsmaymovecompletely
freely leading to maximal diamagnetism.
e. The principle of the magnet break is based on the repelling force dia-
magnetism gives rise to.
f. In the water molecule the dipole moments from the closed electron
motions, i.e. the orbital and spin moments, are cancelled. Since the
water molecule is a permanent electric dipole it follows that the elec-
trons posses a certain freedom to move. As in metal this freedom causes
diamagnetism. According to Table (9.2), the diamagnetism of water is
stronger than for e.g. copper.
8.12 a. This is due to internal interactions between the dipoles of the material.
b. The material responds with a dipole moment in a different direction
than that of the external inﬂuence. This effect is formalised by letting
the material constants become a matrix in three dimensions:
κ =
⎛
⎝
κxx κxy κxz
κyx κyy κyz
κzx κzy κzz
⎞
⎠
so that an inﬂuence in e.g. x direction might give a response in the y
or/and z direction.
c. In the electric case, the voltage over the material is measured in different
directions. In the magnetic case the magnetization in different directions
may be measured using e.g. a Hall sensor, see Exercise (8.14).

is an array property and therefore independent on the particular individual
antennas. The reﬂection law is therefore valid for any type of surface. In
particular, it is well known that a water surface also obeys the reﬂection law
although the individual antenna elements are radically different in these two
cases. In case of the mirror, the conduction electrons act as antenna elements
whereas in case of water it is the molecular water dipoles.
11.5 This problem is equivalent to the reﬂection case in Exercise (11.4). The acti-
vated oscillators at the surface of the material are now interacting on the other
side of the surface. The reason for the change of direction of the lines of max-
imum force is that the speed of the force mediation differs in the two media.
Denoting speed in the media of incoming force as c0 and the speed in the
transmitted media as c, the array factor becomes

sin α = 0
so that
c sin α = c0 sin γ
which is Snell’s ‘refraction law’.
Why is then the mediation speed different in different media? This may
qualitatively be understood by understanding that materials are built up of
parallel layers of surfaces consisting of arrays of dipoles. The force mediation
isamatteroftransmittingthedipolevibrationsfromlayertolayerwhosespeed
is clearly dependent on the particular material structure.
11.6 The vibrating dipole at the surface align with the force in medium 2, F2. Along
the dipole axis, there is no force mediation, see formula (11.31). If the dipole
axis is oriented such that it points in the direction of the reﬂection, i.e. force
F2 forms an angle α with the surface normal, then the reﬂection vanishes.
This happens when
α + γ = 90◦
The refraction law, Exercise (11.5), becomes
c sin α = c0 sin γ = c0 sin(90◦−α) = c0 cos α
so that the Brewster angle αB is given by
tan αB = c0
c
11.7 The reﬂection appears between close layers of the atmosphere which have
almost identical structure. The mediation speeds in two neighbouring layers
are therefore almost the same.
When the incident angle equals the Brewster angle, one component of force
will vanish. This then appears at
tan αB = c0
c ≈1
αB = 45◦
Therefore, the angle β in the ﬁgure is 90◦, so that the spider has maximum
navigation aid directly above herself, practical of course.

c =

so that the refractive index is

11.10 To obtain a plane wave to be directed to the other side of the surface normal,
i.e. negative transmission angel γ , the upper oscillator in the ﬁgure of Exercise
(11.5) has to start oscillate before the lower one. This means the effect of the
inﬂuence has to occur before its cause.

11.14 The antenna radiates as in the ﬁgure. The reﬂected power is equivalent to a
power emission from an antenna placed at the real antenna’s mirror image. The
question is then what the relative phase is. The electric ﬁeld vector is directed
perpendicular to the power direction. To ﬁt boundary condition (10.55) at the
surface of the metal, the electric ﬁeld vector of the reﬂected power has to
have a horizontal component that cancels the incident horizontal ﬁeld. The
orientation of the mirror dipole is therefore anti-parallel to the real antenna,
i.e. they oscillate in opposite phase.

General Magnetic Force Formula
In Sect.2.2, the magnetic force formula was heuristically formulated based on mea-
surements. In this appendix a systematic approach is presented. The objective is
to ﬁnd a single force formula describing both parallel and perpendicular relative
motional direction. To this end, a general vector expression in each case is devel-
oped. Due to the basic property of vector formulas each of these expressions must
then be valid for both cases. Thus, by requiring compatibility between the two for-
mulas, a ﬁnal concise formula will be obtained.
To summarize, it has been obtained for the two cases
¯fm|| = −μ0I1dL1
4π R2
q2v2(a cos θ ˆy + sin θ ˆx)
(2.7)
¯fm⊥= μ0I1dL1
4π R2
q2v2(sin θ ˆy + b cos θ ˆx)
(2.10)
as the force acting on charge q2.
Since the force should be written in terms of the charges, the current element is
rewritten as I1dL1 = q1v1. The force must be expressed vectorially independent of
coordinate system so the only usable vectors are v1, v2 and R. For the moment the
factor (μ0q1q2)/(4π R2) is left out and formula (2.7) may be written as
¯fm|| = −v1v2(a cos θ ˆy + sin θ ˆx)
(E.1)
and formula (2.10)
¯fm⊥= v1v2(sin θ ˆy + b cos θ ˆx)
(E.2)
Generally, (E.1) may be expressed, with notations as in Fig.2.8,

where the ﬁrst two terms correspond to the y component and the last two to the x

2. Compatibility between (E.3) and (E.4)
Expanding the cross products in formulas (E.3) and (E.4) gives

(E.6)
and the following conditions for the constants may be identiﬁed:
Criteria no. 1 gives:
A + B = a
C + D = 1
E + F = 1
G + H = b
By comparing vectors in formulas (E.5) and (E.6) criteria no. 2 gives:
B + D = E + F
A + C = G + H
−D −C = −F −H
which gives a = b and the following table:

Answer: The twelve terms in (E.5) and (E.6) are not linearly independent.
For example, it is necessary to know only the sum A + C, not each constant
independently.
